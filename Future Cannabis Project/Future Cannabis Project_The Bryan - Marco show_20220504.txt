[00:00.000 --> 00:04.160]  Yeah, what's up, Living Soil nerds?
[00:04.160 --> 00:05.460]  It's another Wednesday.
[00:05.460 --> 00:08.120]  Happy to be here with Mr. Marco.
[00:08.120 --> 00:13.800]  We have a guest IT man behind the scenes for the next few weeks while Chad is enjoying
[00:13.800 --> 00:14.800]  himself.
[00:14.800 --> 00:19.440]  So, Mr. Ken, we appreciate you being behind the scenes and kind of helping us through
[00:19.440 --> 00:20.440]  this.
[00:20.440 --> 00:25.920]  Marco, on Sunday, man, I had another one of those reptile shows, a fan of the show and
[00:25.920 --> 00:32.080]  somebody that I feel like is really taking hold and putting in the work was a gentleman
[00:32.080 --> 00:33.080]  named Ryan.
[00:33.080 --> 00:34.080]  So I wanted to shout out Ryan.
[00:34.080 --> 00:37.520]  He gave me some IMO that he had made.
[00:37.520 --> 00:41.880]  Somebody that obviously is kind of really watching the show and taking it to the next
[00:41.880 --> 00:42.880]  level like we'd like.
[00:42.880 --> 00:45.440]  So, heck yeah, give me some IMO.
[00:45.440 --> 00:50.360]  And then also got some stuff from around Colorado.
[00:50.360 --> 00:52.360]  Here's one from Carr, Colorado.
[00:52.360 --> 00:53.360]  Nice.
[00:53.800 --> 00:54.800]  Nice.
[00:54.800 --> 00:58.000]  A little IMO to action right there.
[00:58.000 --> 01:01.120]  And Idaho Springs.
[01:01.120 --> 01:02.640]  It says summer and rain.
[01:02.640 --> 01:04.800]  So again, like really taking notes and stuff.
[01:04.800 --> 01:09.960]  I just wanted to give him a shout out because, you know, this is, in my opinion, better than
[01:09.960 --> 01:13.640]  like a gift, any kind of other gift, man, because it allows me to continue to build
[01:13.640 --> 01:15.320]  up my company.
[01:15.320 --> 01:17.240]  And that's something that is near and dear to me.
[01:17.240 --> 01:20.600]  And that's something that IMO is really taking it to the next level.
[01:21.400 --> 01:23.480]  I have a bearded dragon.
[01:23.480 --> 01:24.480]  That's what I got.
[01:24.480 --> 01:25.480]  I saw that, man.
[01:25.480 --> 01:30.040]  What color was that when it looked kind of kind of cool, like reddish or rust?
[01:30.040 --> 01:32.080]  He's like a hypo orange red.
[01:32.080 --> 01:37.160]  And from what I understand, that's the unless you're getting into like the super elites,
[01:37.160 --> 01:38.440]  that's a pretty rare one.
[01:38.440 --> 01:43.560]  So I was gracious enough to have somebody give that to my my boys.
[01:43.560 --> 01:48.400]  And it's been allowing me to play around and build up the biodiversity on that side of
[01:48.400 --> 01:49.400]  the system.
[01:49.560 --> 01:50.560]  Yeah.
[01:50.560 --> 01:54.440]  Again, just, you know, skill sets, I think, Marco, you know, we can continue to improve
[01:54.440 --> 01:55.440]  things.
[01:55.440 --> 01:58.800]  I've learned a lot, you know, just even this last year with having you on the show, man,
[01:58.800 --> 02:00.800]  and just chopping it up with individuals.
[02:00.800 --> 02:05.280]  And I hope that more people kind of start to do that and have their own church, if you
[02:05.280 --> 02:09.920]  will, and kind of just talk amongst each other, because that's really where real education
[02:09.920 --> 02:13.600]  and experience can come from and save a lot of time is when you're just meeting up with
[02:13.600 --> 02:15.000]  peers that have been working on this.
[02:15.000 --> 02:16.840]  So again, shout out to Ryan.
[02:16.840 --> 02:17.960]  Appreciate you, sir.
[02:17.960 --> 02:22.400]  Appreciate everybody that comes up to us when we're out and, you know, watches the show.
[02:22.400 --> 02:26.160]  I forget the gentleman's name, Marco, but when we were watching some of the speeches,
[02:26.160 --> 02:27.680]  another gentleman came up.
[02:27.680 --> 02:30.880]  So whoever you were, sir, I'm sorry, I don't remember.
[02:30.880 --> 02:32.720]  Marco got me lit.
[02:32.720 --> 02:35.000]  Yeah, Nick, Nick came out.
[02:35.000 --> 02:37.840]  Nick hung out with us a little bit.
[02:37.840 --> 02:38.840]  Shout out Sticky District.
[02:38.840 --> 02:41.080]  Yeah, there we go on here.
[02:41.080 --> 02:42.080]  Yeah.
[02:42.080 --> 02:45.240]  So we appreciate it when people that watch the show just kind of come up and especially
[02:45.240 --> 02:49.040]  when you're taking it to the next level and, you know, telling me that Marco has really
[02:49.040 --> 02:50.920]  inspired you to do these things.
[02:50.920 --> 02:58.000]  And just again, man, that's just something that not everybody kind of, I don't know,
[02:58.000 --> 03:01.520]  experiences because we're just, you know, when I turn the computer off, buddy, you know,
[03:01.520 --> 03:06.360]  we kind of go about our day and stuff and we don't really get to meet individuals.
[03:06.360 --> 03:08.520]  So when we do, it was just something it was just something cool, man.
[03:08.520 --> 03:09.960]  I had a little cool moment with Ryan.
[03:09.960 --> 03:11.120]  Just wanted to put that out there.
[03:11.120 --> 03:12.560]  Yeah, that's pretty cool, man.
[03:12.560 --> 03:16.480]  Some of those are like some of my best, you know, interactions with folks, man, when it's
[03:16.480 --> 03:21.400]  just real genuine, you know, they they hit you with something and you know that they're
[03:21.400 --> 03:25.600]  kind of, you know, they they're they're on board with what we're doing or they're watching
[03:25.600 --> 03:29.920]  what we're doing because else they wouldn't know kind of those little inside tips and
[03:29.920 --> 03:32.560]  just even like sharing that IMO with you, man.
[03:32.560 --> 03:34.000]  That's pretty that's pretty cool.
[03:34.000 --> 03:35.320]  That's a great gift.
[03:35.320 --> 03:38.560]  Like to me, something like that is like, you know, a lifetime gift.
[03:38.760 --> 03:43.840]  You know, we guys were building our soil and, you know, a lot of these soils were building.
[03:43.840 --> 03:49.120]  A lot of folks are on the horizontal stuff and these four by fours and even in the larger
[03:49.600 --> 03:54.040]  facilities are going four by whatever, 30, 40, 50 feet.
[03:54.560 --> 03:59.160]  And these are soils which to me are like, you know, family members, you know what I mean?
[03:59.160 --> 04:00.920]  Those things are going to be with you, you know.
[04:01.160 --> 04:06.000]  So when someone gives you that IMO, you know, to put it to your soil, to me, that's like
[04:06.040 --> 04:10.880]  a long term, like a lifetime kind of thing, because that IMO is going to stay in your
[04:10.880 --> 04:16.880]  soil, add a little diversity and, you know, just strengthen your soil overall.
[04:16.880 --> 04:18.240]  So pretty cool.
[04:18.240 --> 04:22.160]  Yeah, I like I get a lot of gifts like that, man, little IMOs and things like that.
[04:22.160 --> 04:26.200]  Shout out to Heather out here on IG.
[04:26.200 --> 04:28.880]  She's always looking out.
[04:28.880 --> 04:30.360]  She brought some IMO, too.
[04:30.360 --> 04:32.400]  She brought me some cannabis stalks.
[04:32.800 --> 04:37.640]  So, yeah, man, just things like that are really good, you know, good gifts to share amongst
[04:37.640 --> 04:40.920]  each other. Like I've gotten, you know, like rabbit poop, you know what I mean?
[04:41.160 --> 04:45.560]  If you ever see me and you got it in a bag, I'll gladly take some rabbit poop, you know
[04:45.560 --> 04:50.720]  what I mean? And even you, Brian, like, man, you've actually inspired me because I've been
[04:50.720 --> 04:52.880]  watching what you're doing and just hearing you talk.
[04:52.880 --> 04:58.280]  And even though you don't show us the love that you got in those in those living soil
[04:58.280 --> 05:02.960]  bins, the ones where Rick Ross goes and takes his crap, you don't show those a lot, man.
[05:02.960 --> 05:07.320]  But I can feel like and I can sense kind of how you got that thing set up and the
[05:07.320 --> 05:09.160]  diversity that you have in there.
[05:09.400 --> 05:13.000]  And so that's really, you know, has me embracing rabbits.
[05:13.000 --> 05:15.840]  You know, I got a couple of people that are holding some rabbits for me.
[05:16.640 --> 05:22.800]  Once they're old enough, I'm going to start a little rabbit hutch and maybe six or eight
[05:22.800 --> 05:25.120]  rabbits just to get some of that poop.
[05:25.120 --> 05:28.000]  And I know I'm kind of we're going down different roads here, but we're kind of just
[05:28.000 --> 05:29.320]  freestyling today, guys.
[05:29.320 --> 05:33.480]  You know, I just wanted to we didn't have a guest and we could have had some folks on.
[05:33.480 --> 05:38.080]  But sometimes, you know, it's OK to just, you know, just chop it up a little bit and give a
[05:38.080 --> 05:39.280]  little bit to the to the chat.
[05:39.280 --> 05:41.400]  And we're going to be reading your comments a lot today.
[05:42.840 --> 05:47.120]  Yeah, and it's kind of an impromptu, like you can kind of ask us anything type.
[05:47.120 --> 05:48.480]  We've had a show like that before.
[05:48.480 --> 05:51.280]  So kind of get your question is questions in.
[05:51.960 --> 05:56.880]  I posted up earlier today about like kind of topics and stuff that you guys want to talk
[05:56.880 --> 06:01.160]  about. The Rolodex is pretty strong between Marco and I.
[06:01.160 --> 06:06.400]  So if you guys want to have specific speakers or topics or stuff like that, really reach
[06:06.400 --> 06:11.200]  out to us, man. We got I got some more free time as kind of just sitting around waiting for
[06:11.200 --> 06:12.200]  my daughter to be born.
[06:12.760 --> 06:16.640]  So I want to kind of work on this stuff while I have some time and really build out the
[06:16.640 --> 06:20.320]  show and just kind of cater again more to the audience.
[06:20.320 --> 06:23.360]  So if you guys want to see specifics, just just reach out to us.
[06:23.960 --> 06:26.520]  Otherwise, we can always kind of talk on general things.
[06:27.240 --> 06:32.080]  Marco, I know from experience, man, having that many rabbits, you are going to have more
[06:32.080 --> 06:33.920]  rabbit manure than you know what to do with.
[06:34.720 --> 06:39.600]  So for people around Marco, I would imagine you guys could probably reach out to him and
[06:39.600 --> 06:41.720]  trade for some again.
[06:41.720 --> 06:42.720]  That's almost like.
[06:43.680 --> 06:46.320]  Now, that's something like, yes, like leaf litter.
[06:46.320 --> 06:49.000]  I got hundreds of yards in a leaf pile.
[06:49.040 --> 06:53.200]  I'll gladly give you some, but, you know, I'm glad I got that much.
[06:53.200 --> 06:57.400]  And if I get rabbit poop and it starts running out my ears, then I'll figure out something
[06:57.400 --> 07:01.880]  to do with it. I really want to get in there, get enough of it to kind of make a complete
[07:01.880 --> 07:08.120]  IMO three with just rabbit poop as one of the main ingredients in an IMO pile.
[07:08.160 --> 07:09.800]  I think that would be pretty cool.
[07:10.800 --> 07:14.400]  Looking forward to just getting my hands on the rabbits, you know, getting them here.
[07:14.960 --> 07:16.680]  I got plenty of good.
[07:17.240 --> 07:20.080]  I know they have a strict diet and I'm learning all that.
[07:20.080 --> 07:23.560]  And so I don't need to chat hitting me with all that, but I'm going to definitely feed
[07:23.560 --> 07:28.320]  them their recommended diet, but also have things that I want to supplement and kind
[07:28.320 --> 07:31.000]  of give them like comfrey, things that I grow here.
[07:31.880 --> 07:36.200]  A lot of the I think they clover, things like that.
[07:36.200 --> 07:40.600]  You know, we have a lot of sassafras trees here and I see the local rabbits reaching
[07:40.600 --> 07:42.440]  up and grabbing some of those lower leaves.
[07:42.480 --> 07:43.960]  I want to try some stuff like that.
[07:44.080 --> 07:44.200]  Yeah.
[07:45.800 --> 07:50.640]  Yeah, and I have one one rabbit, the lion head, and I go out of my way to feed them
[07:50.640 --> 07:53.880]  organic foods, fruits, vegetables and all that stuff.
[07:53.880 --> 07:58.600]  So it's not like it's not like it's a hindrance having that is just something that you
[07:58.600 --> 07:59.760]  have a few extra scraps.
[07:59.760 --> 08:01.560]  You know, you cut some strawberries up for the kids.
[08:01.560 --> 08:05.360]  You got a few extras, even the top, the rabbits going to eat all that.
[08:05.680 --> 08:09.600]  And again, if it's organic, just kind of go out of your way, spend a little extra money
[08:09.600 --> 08:13.360]  and you'll actually you'll even notice in the poop and that kind of thing, especially
[08:13.360 --> 08:17.880]  when there's enough Timothy hay and all that, that the manure just looks pristine
[08:17.880 --> 08:23.720]  compared to kind of this like smaller, darker rabbit manure when the rabbit's not
[08:23.720 --> 08:28.200]  eating healthy. I would imagine it's just like in anything else when when the digestion
[08:28.200 --> 08:30.000]  isn't there, especially for the rabbit.
[08:30.920 --> 08:33.600]  It's not a healthy manure that comes out of the rabbit.
[08:33.640 --> 08:38.600]  You can tell the difference when you finally get that hay, the Timothy hay up.
[08:38.600 --> 08:41.520]  And then once that happens, you'll really see the difference.
[08:41.520 --> 08:43.560]  You'll be able to kind of even squish it and break it up.
[08:44.160 --> 08:47.880]  And that's when you know that that's in a way this is kind of weird talking about like
[08:47.880 --> 08:51.760]  this. But that's when you know you got the fire manure coming out of that rabbit is when
[08:51.760 --> 08:53.560]  it can actually kind of be broken down.
[08:53.560 --> 08:56.640]  It's almost in a cold, soft, soft.
[08:57.960 --> 08:59.440]  Yes, I'm a granular.
[08:59.440 --> 09:00.360]  Yeah, I know what you mean.
[09:00.360 --> 09:05.200]  It gives that kind of IMO, kind of like IMO consistency as it's dry and kind of a
[09:05.200 --> 09:11.400]  crumble. But yeah, man, so I definitely I'm definitely excited about the rabbits and
[09:11.520 --> 09:13.080]  their enclosure.
[09:13.080 --> 09:19.560]  I want to do just living soil floor, you know, like a natural farming living floor.
[09:20.160 --> 09:23.960]  And what that consists of is just like hugelkultur almost.
[09:24.280 --> 09:29.200]  I'm going to start out with like some larger logs as a bottom layer, filling in with
[09:29.200 --> 09:34.440]  some wood chips and then going with soil on top of that and then adding an IMO.
[09:35.720 --> 09:37.640]  Deer poop. Good question.
[09:38.280 --> 09:41.760]  Another couple of things, just so people know kind of what we got going on today, I'm
[09:41.760 --> 09:45.120]  going to go back right here on my table.
[09:45.360 --> 09:50.360]  And a lot of people have been asking, like, how do I use like natural farming inputs?
[09:50.360 --> 09:52.160]  Like how do how do we grow plants?
[09:52.160 --> 09:56.120]  How do you how do you grow your cannabis with natural farming inputs?
[09:56.120 --> 10:00.400]  So I want to do a little demonstration of how I do it and what makes sense to me and
[10:00.400 --> 10:05.080]  what's been working so people can kind of get a grasp of, you know, not only it's OK,
[10:05.080 --> 10:09.040]  everybody talks about how to make this stuff, but then, you know, also, you know how to
[10:09.040 --> 10:11.640]  use it properly or the way it works.
[10:11.640 --> 10:14.480]  So should be pretty cool show, man.
[10:14.720 --> 10:20.680]  Deer poop. Now people, someone tried to argue with me to my knowledge and my
[10:20.680 --> 10:24.480]  understanding and reading deer poop is not a coal manure.
[10:25.080 --> 10:27.880]  It is not the same as rabbit nor alpaca.
[10:28.800 --> 10:34.200]  And if somebody has some info that's that's different than that, I'd like to read that.
[10:34.760 --> 10:39.520]  But a lot of what I've read about deer poop and especially with deer being the way they are
[10:39.520 --> 10:46.640]  wild and they carry a lot of parasites, their poop actually does carry a lot of parasites
[10:46.640 --> 10:49.240]  in it. You know, it's not like the rabbit and the alpaca.
[10:49.240 --> 10:51.200]  So be careful what you do.
[10:51.200 --> 10:57.080]  And what I told the guys, I said, listen, if I were to use deer poop, then I would compost.
[10:57.360 --> 11:01.320]  You know what I mean? That'd be something I would let sit in a pile for a certain period of
[11:01.320 --> 11:03.760]  time or even compost before I used it.
[11:04.440 --> 11:08.400]  Yeah. And like you had mentioned with some of the risks, maybe even vermicompost deer.
[11:08.600 --> 11:13.760]  That's why we always just talk about rabbit manure and alpaca, especially if you're doing
[11:13.760 --> 11:18.240]  something indoors. I would only, you know, especially if you're especially if you're new to
[11:18.240 --> 11:23.080]  this, I wouldn't really mess around with anything but those two manures because they're
[11:23.080 --> 11:28.480]  tried and true. When you get more into the other, the bovine and all that kind of source
[11:28.480 --> 11:29.880]  obviously matters a lot.
[11:29.880 --> 11:33.520]  And there's just so many variables where it's probably not really worth it.
[11:35.040 --> 11:39.560]  It would be so much easier to just buy a little bunny and have the bunny, you know, hop
[11:39.560 --> 11:41.120]  around, potty train it.
[11:41.680 --> 11:43.840]  And then you have a little more enjoyment in life, too.
[11:44.880 --> 11:45.880]  Yeah, definitely.
[11:46.200 --> 11:48.160]  OK, Archie, be grown.
[11:48.200 --> 11:49.720]  Cheers, Brian and Marco.
[11:50.720 --> 11:55.880]  Peace, smoke. Would seawater collected during a red tide be beneficial for anything?
[11:56.440 --> 11:57.480]  I think it would.
[11:57.600 --> 12:03.400]  I think that I think that what the algae that caused the red tide when they're in your
[12:03.400 --> 12:07.720]  soil, I don't obviously they wouldn't survive.
[12:07.960 --> 12:14.680]  I think that would be good definitely to put into a JLF, possibly an already established
[12:14.680 --> 12:24.120]  JLF. And I look at that red tide as being more of just nutrient cycling or food for the
[12:24.120 --> 12:26.000]  other biology. You know what I mean?
[12:26.520 --> 12:30.360]  So, yeah, that would be something I would try, but definitely read up on it.
[12:31.360 --> 12:36.680]  We all know it's bad because what it does is it's it's an it's an algae and it gets so
[12:37.160 --> 12:41.280]  prolific. It's to the point where the fish can't have oxygen.
[12:41.320 --> 12:46.000]  You know, it like it takes the oxygen out of the water and and the fish die.
[12:46.400 --> 12:52.080]  Obviously, we wouldn't be taking that and using it to grow fish or to try to cultivate
[12:52.080 --> 12:55.440]  any kind of living aquatic organism.
[12:55.720 --> 13:01.280]  So if we took that, you know, to me on a microscopic level, even L.A.
[13:01.280 --> 13:02.480]  B. If you added L.A.
[13:02.480 --> 13:07.600]  B. into that, to me, that would outcompete that and make it into a valuable input.
[13:07.600 --> 13:09.560]  So that would be something I would try.
[13:09.560 --> 13:10.920]  You know, just my mindset.
[13:10.960 --> 13:15.040]  You know what I mean? You guys, if you guys got something different or anybody knows a
[13:15.040 --> 13:17.480]  little bit more on it, man, just spit it out.
[13:18.040 --> 13:19.120]  But that was a great question.
[13:19.280 --> 13:20.720]  Yeah, that is a great question.
[13:20.720 --> 13:24.400]  And when you're more in like the mountain states and that kind of stuff where we are, it
[13:24.400 --> 13:29.960]  does seem like if you're able to get a hold of ocean water, there's just something kind of
[13:29.960 --> 13:32.720]  magical to that compared to what everybody else is growing.
[13:33.440 --> 13:36.400]  So I would I would say continue to experiment with that.
[13:37.120 --> 13:38.720]  Use caution, obviously.
[13:38.720 --> 13:42.880]  But yeah, there's really nothing you can do as long as you know how to manage a soil
[13:42.880 --> 13:45.680]  system where I feel like you would allow it to get out of control.
[13:46.120 --> 13:47.680]  That's what allows you to experiment.
[13:47.680 --> 13:51.560]  That's what has allowed me to continue to kind of play around with things, because if
[13:51.600 --> 13:55.720]  something kind of does start to get out of control, just throw a little more compost in there.
[13:55.720 --> 14:00.440]  You know, it's it's relatively easy to kind of fix your mistakes as you're learning this.
[14:01.440 --> 14:05.720]  Yeah, quick one on Robo crop, coal manure.
[14:06.120 --> 14:07.560]  What does that even mean?
[14:07.560 --> 14:11.520]  How is composting making less nutrients available?
[14:11.520 --> 14:13.720]  Explain it instead of repeating it.
[14:13.960 --> 14:16.600]  I've over fertilized with rabbit manure before.
[14:16.600 --> 14:17.600]  Newts are newts.
[14:18.480 --> 14:21.120]  Well, you know, anything can be overdone, my man.
[14:21.120 --> 14:25.520]  I mean, you you've never heard anybody just saying, hey, fill a pot with rabbit manure and
[14:25.520 --> 14:29.760]  grow your plants like there's limits to how much of anything is going to be good and bad.
[14:30.040 --> 14:34.120]  And what we mean by coal manure is if you take, for instance, chicken manure and you try
[14:34.120 --> 14:37.280]  to put that around your plants, it's very hot.
[14:37.280 --> 14:39.200]  It's very high in bacteria.
[14:39.400 --> 14:44.680]  It's very hot, meaning, you know, it's very nutrient dense in a form that plants can't
[14:44.680 --> 14:45.800]  readily use.
[14:46.240 --> 14:53.280]  Coal manures are broken down in that animal's gut to the point where it's basically plant
[14:53.280 --> 14:55.040]  readily available nutrients.
[14:55.040 --> 15:00.360]  So just because it's readily available to plants doesn't mean that you can't overdo it.
[15:01.160 --> 15:05.480]  So, you know, that's kind of what we mean by coal manure readily available to the plant and
[15:05.480 --> 15:10.640]  the soil, whereas other manures like cow, horse, chicken, anything like that, if you were
[15:10.640 --> 15:14.040]  to put that in your soil, it would be very detrimental.
[15:14.840 --> 15:16.800]  It would burn your plants up really bad.
[15:16.840 --> 15:18.480]  So, yeah, you can overdo anything.
[15:19.120 --> 15:21.280]  Yeah, rabbit manure is a top feed.
[15:21.400 --> 15:24.880]  You know, that's really kind of just a part of the ignition switches.
[15:25.360 --> 15:29.600]  I wouldn't necessarily say that's the dominant force for anything of your nutritional
[15:29.600 --> 15:34.840]  program. It's just like the sprinkles on top of ice cream, man, just to get things a little
[15:34.840 --> 15:37.600]  bit extra, you know, to get the microbial world kicking.
[15:38.160 --> 15:42.240]  You might want to get a little more springtails, isopods, things that love to break down
[15:42.240 --> 15:47.080]  those cold manures so that they're also eating that and kind of balancing things out.
[15:47.600 --> 15:52.160]  And I've always had, you know, things always seem to blossom when you add composting
[15:52.160 --> 15:53.560]  worms, when you're using manures.
[15:54.120 --> 15:56.480]  So that might be another quick fix for you as well.
[15:57.520 --> 15:57.840]  Yeah.
[15:57.840 --> 15:58.400]  What do you think about that?
[15:59.200 --> 15:59.680]  Go ahead, bro.
[16:00.040 --> 16:01.760]  I was going to move on to the next question.
[16:01.760 --> 16:01.880]  Yeah.
[16:02.720 --> 16:03.520]  No, no, I'm good.
[16:03.520 --> 16:10.600]  Yeah. So when it comes to the rabbit coops, like I'm saying, guys, I just allow I have a
[16:10.960 --> 16:14.280]  maybe maybe we should do a show on that, Marco, where I could set that up in the basement.
[16:14.280 --> 16:19.240]  But I have a little rabbit coop, but it's it's obviously down in the basement and I don't
[16:19.240 --> 16:22.000]  really put anything in there because I don't really want him to chill in there.
[16:22.000 --> 16:23.080]  I want him to run around.
[16:23.080 --> 16:26.040]  So he has that like if he gets scared or just kind of wants to hang out.
[16:26.280 --> 16:28.120]  I'll put some treats in there every now and then.
[16:28.640 --> 16:33.320]  But he has one pot that he that he poops in and then he has another little pot that seems
[16:33.320 --> 16:35.920]  like in case you just have an extra one.
[16:36.280 --> 16:39.320]  I've always had at least two at my old house.
[16:39.320 --> 16:43.400]  I had probably like six or seven, but I have way more room to do worm farming back then.
[16:43.760 --> 16:47.160]  So if you give them a variety of pots, it's going to be really easy to train them.
[16:47.960 --> 16:51.640]  If you give them one or two, I feel like they might already need to be potty trained for
[16:51.640 --> 16:53.600]  them to kind of understand all of that stuff.
[16:54.200 --> 16:58.000]  But it's really easy to allow them to run around, like I said.
[16:58.000 --> 17:00.160]  And once they're potty trained, I wouldn't keep them in a coop.
[17:00.920 --> 17:02.840]  I wouldn't put any charcoal or anything.
[17:02.840 --> 17:05.920]  I just have springtails, rove beetles in there breaking stuff down.
[17:06.560 --> 17:11.080]  And the springtails really take off in the manure with the with the soil system.
[17:11.080 --> 17:15.800]  So once those really take off, you can add cucumbers on top of those springtails and
[17:15.800 --> 17:20.440]  then you'll see an unbelievable amount of springtails on those cucumbers.
[17:20.440 --> 17:25.680]  And then you can continue to build from your worm bins that are focused on like rabbit
[17:25.680 --> 17:30.280]  manure. And then I have worm bins that are more focused on like just hay and and organic
[17:30.280 --> 17:33.160]  matter. Again, just kind of playing around.
[17:34.120 --> 17:35.200]  That makes sense. Yeah.
[17:35.200 --> 17:41.920]  What I what I want to do for my rabbits, I have this space, which is a steel used to
[17:41.920 --> 17:42.960]  be a loading dock.
[17:42.960 --> 17:46.600]  One of my friends had a he has a trucking company and they used to use this for a
[17:46.600 --> 17:51.000]  loading dock. So it's about four feet tall and it's like eight feet by eight feet
[17:51.000 --> 17:53.120]  decked steel with guardrail.
[17:53.600 --> 17:56.400]  And underneath of it is where I want to build my hutches.
[17:56.400 --> 18:01.600]  So I want to have that floor of my where my rabbits, they'll stand on cages.
[18:01.600 --> 18:05.920]  But then where they're pooping all drops and where I guess they're kind of general
[18:05.920 --> 18:08.400]  area where they can go kind of congregate if they want.
[18:08.600 --> 18:11.320]  People say rabbits don't really like to have a common space.
[18:11.320 --> 18:13.360]  So I'll probably just keep them in there.
[18:13.360 --> 18:17.320]  But below them is where I want to do that kind of living living floor.
[18:17.520 --> 18:21.960]  So it's kind of like similar to what you're doing in the bins, just scaling up, just
[18:21.960 --> 18:23.200]  being outdoors now.
[18:23.720 --> 18:28.440]  And I think that'll be a nice, really valuable spot to gather from being out there
[18:28.440 --> 18:29.880]  on the ground and everything, too.
[18:29.960 --> 18:31.560]  Yeah, I mean, you're living the dream, buddy.
[18:31.560 --> 18:33.120]  I'm trying to make it work in a basement.
[18:33.800 --> 18:37.040]  Yeah, yeah. So I'm thankful I'm outdoors, man.
[18:37.040 --> 18:38.400]  And you and man.
[18:38.520 --> 18:41.000]  But see, that's that's the great thing about natural farming.
[18:41.000 --> 18:46.080]  All this stuff just scales up and down, whether it's a bucket or a jar, you know,
[18:46.080 --> 18:49.880]  it's like, you know, small jars like it's all kind of scalable.
[18:49.880 --> 18:54.680]  One to one thousand and certain things, different ratios don't matter what size it
[18:54.680 --> 19:00.400]  is, you know. So obviously like JLFs, a five gallon to me is probably the smallest I
[19:00.400 --> 19:03.400]  go. But I've made a JLFs in small jars, too.
[19:04.360 --> 19:07.200]  And what JLFs are just liquid fertilizers, guys.
[19:07.200 --> 19:11.520]  We'll talk about that when I kind of set up and make the inputs over here.
[19:13.320 --> 19:17.280]  This question here, I would say I've actually noticed that the plants respond better
[19:17.280 --> 19:22.560]  from stress and stuff when you're growing organically than compared to synthetics.
[19:23.120 --> 19:26.120]  The only time I've had praying leaves and that kind of stuff from my personal
[19:26.120 --> 19:31.000]  experience is when I was focused on building those soil systems, getting the fan leaves
[19:31.000 --> 19:37.080]  to pray and then defoiling a lot of that stuff, you know, kind of breaking that that
[19:37.080 --> 19:43.880]  down. Anytime there was a fan leaf over a cannabis bud, unless it was at like day 21.
[19:43.880 --> 19:49.040]  So before that, I would I would kind of like bend that down or allow it to still be
[19:49.040 --> 19:53.480]  there. And then once day 21 hit, then you're starting to snap all the fan leaves off.
[19:54.320 --> 19:59.360]  And I would say. I think even belief said this and I'm still.
[20:01.760 --> 20:06.760]  You have to have very healthy plants to do that, but if you want to go really heavy with
[20:06.760 --> 20:11.920]  that, I see a lot of individuals that are understanding how the plant is, the overall
[20:11.960 --> 20:13.520]  health of their whole grow room.
[20:14.080 --> 20:18.840]  But if the plants are healthy, they do go they go pretty strong on that on day 21.
[20:19.920 --> 20:27.000]  Yeah, he did say that and like I've never done defoliation as you know, as belief stated
[20:27.000 --> 20:28.880]  it on day one and day 21.
[20:28.920 --> 20:32.320]  I think that's great to have that kind of, you know, that way to do it.
[20:32.320 --> 20:37.800]  But yeah, definitely that first week of when I flipped a flower, I definitely go for a
[20:37.800 --> 20:44.120]  pretty hard defoliation and then and also shaving up from the bottom up to clear out
[20:44.600 --> 20:45.640]  the lowers.
[20:45.960 --> 20:49.000]  And then but I've never really done like on a day 21.
[20:49.000 --> 20:52.840]  But what I do is throughout a flower, I'm constantly plucking and picking leaves that
[20:52.840 --> 20:58.160]  are covering flower sites, you know, and by the end of it, a lot of the leaves end up
[20:58.160 --> 21:00.160]  defoliant. But then they're also growing back.
[21:00.160 --> 21:03.400]  So, you know, I don't know there's a difference.
[21:03.400 --> 21:05.640]  Brother Ken may know a little bit more about that.
[21:06.160 --> 21:10.760]  Well, actually, I was just watching a video this morning from John Ruffalo.
[21:11.520 --> 21:14.200]  He did a defoliation.
[21:14.240 --> 21:22.560]  He came back and he was finding that he hadn't snapped the leaf, the stem off close enough
[21:22.720 --> 21:24.160]  to the stalk.
[21:24.520 --> 21:27.560]  And it was causing a mold issue.
[21:27.560 --> 21:33.120]  And he was actually having to cut the tops of his plants right off the top buds because
[21:33.120 --> 21:34.000]  of this mold.
[21:34.240 --> 21:40.880]  So when you're defoliating and I defoliate on day 21 myself, you got to make sure that
[21:40.880 --> 21:46.640]  you get that stem all the way to the stalk or else you're going to have the opportunity
[21:46.640 --> 21:49.400]  for mold to set in as it starts to decompose.
[21:49.760 --> 21:56.080]  Now, the other thing is when you're defoliating, you also have to consider that the
[21:56.120 --> 21:58.920]  calcium stays in the lower leaves of your plant.
[21:59.360 --> 22:04.800]  And so when you defoliate, you're removing that calcium that she has stored up.
[22:05.080 --> 22:11.640]  And that's, I think, really where your FAA and your water soluble calcium, you're going
[22:11.640 --> 22:16.320]  to really want to make sure you're getting that into the system to make up for the
[22:16.320 --> 22:18.600]  calcium of those leaves that you've removed.
[22:18.800 --> 22:20.280]  So that was all I wanted to say.
[22:21.440 --> 22:25.520]  Great points, excellent points, because, yeah, you know, a lot of people say, well,
[22:25.680 --> 22:28.520]  that's a nutrient storage place for plants, for the plant.
[22:28.520 --> 22:32.920]  Well, it is because really, if you think about it, there's no more plant readily
[22:32.920 --> 22:35.880]  available nutrient than what is inside the plant's leaf.
[22:35.960 --> 22:39.280]  You know, whatever that plant's brought up is the most readily available.
[22:39.560 --> 22:42.800]  So now that you're pulling that off, great points by Ken.
[22:43.480 --> 22:48.880]  Obviously, like you said, Brian, you can't pull that off without having a good system of
[22:49.080 --> 22:53.320]  soil and or nutrient program and healthy plants to even start with.
[22:53.320 --> 22:57.760]  So first of all, healthy plants, then, you know, working your way up to things like
[22:57.760 --> 22:58.720]  defoliation.
[22:59.320 --> 23:03.440]  Yeah, because if your plants aren't healthy and you just start ripping off a bunch of
[23:03.440 --> 23:06.640]  fan leaves and you don't really necessarily know what you're doing, I mean, there's a
[23:06.960 --> 23:08.680]  there's kind of an artwork to it as well.
[23:08.720 --> 23:10.240]  You know, you're not just ripping them off.
[23:10.240 --> 23:15.800]  Some some people believe that you're going to use something sharp, scissors, something of
[23:15.800 --> 23:18.640]  that manner. Other people just kind of pluck them off again.
[23:18.640 --> 23:21.040]  That's kind of more to you and your style.
[23:21.600 --> 23:26.320]  But again, if you're new to this, this is more of a I've had successful flips.
[23:26.320 --> 23:29.080]  Now I want to kind of continue to improve my skill sets.
[23:29.680 --> 23:33.960]  This isn't something that I would recommend doing the first time you get into this, maybe
[23:33.960 --> 23:39.000]  even the second time. Just make sure like Marco and everybody on this platform says, like
[23:39.000 --> 23:42.960]  make sure you have successful flips, be successful farming, and then you're going to be
[23:42.960 --> 23:44.560]  able to kind of take it to the next level.
[23:44.720 --> 23:49.040]  If you want to prune, if you will, then just kind of tuck them down, especially the
[23:49.040 --> 23:54.440]  families. Remember that a bud site obviously is going to over overrule any kind of family.
[23:54.440 --> 23:56.160]  So just tuck that stuff down.
[23:57.480 --> 24:01.560]  It is kind of rewarding to be able to take the time to be able to build that stuff up.
[24:01.920 --> 24:06.000]  And if you're in a small enough environment, you'll you'll notice the difference as as
[24:06.000 --> 24:08.680]  your skill set improves, taking off the families.
[24:09.160 --> 24:13.800]  I've seen improvements from my own personal growth by by taking those down.
[24:13.800 --> 24:18.400]  And we used to call them like going up the skirts and stuff like, you know, cutting the
[24:18.440 --> 24:20.680]  legs, shaving the legs and all that.
[24:20.680 --> 24:26.160]  And that's worth it. I personally used to do that in and veg just so that I could really
[24:26.160 --> 24:28.360]  start to see how she would kind of take hold.
[24:29.000 --> 24:32.360]  And then, of course, again, in a small amount of that into flower.
[24:32.800 --> 24:36.880]  But once she's in flower, man, she's we always joke she's off to college.
[24:37.520 --> 24:42.080]  There's not really much you can do other than just, you know, maintain that relationship and
[24:42.080 --> 24:44.440]  hope she does well. Yeah, definitely.
[24:44.760 --> 24:47.360]  Shout out to Big Pun, 61.
[24:47.960 --> 24:51.000]  I.G., he's he does a great job at default.
[24:51.000 --> 24:52.400]  The way it looks awesome.
[24:52.400 --> 24:56.160]  You can see the results. He shows plenty of pictures along the way.
[24:56.160 --> 25:00.880]  So Big Pun 61 has a good default.
[25:01.600 --> 25:06.480]  What's your guys thoughts on silica, silica acid compared to Axel 16?
[25:06.480 --> 25:11.840]  Also, if you try C90 as a fuller, a lot of people love C90.
[25:12.440 --> 25:14.160]  I haven't tried it. I do a lot of seawater.
[25:15.320 --> 25:16.720]  Terraflora organics.
[25:17.280 --> 25:21.720]  He liked the C90 product and I think it's a fine product.
[25:22.320 --> 25:24.040]  Seawater is seawater.
[25:24.040 --> 25:28.520]  So, I mean, can't really get much better than that if it's a clean source.
[25:30.360 --> 25:34.360]  The other question about the silica acid, what I do.
[25:35.800 --> 25:38.440]  I do. Yeah, Ken is a mad scientist.
[25:39.680 --> 25:42.920]  I like bamboo, man, as sources of silica and horsetail.
[25:43.160 --> 25:44.720]  You know, I'm always going natural.
[25:44.720 --> 25:46.280]  So I like dry bamboo.
[25:46.280 --> 25:50.680]  I shred it to find a shred and then I run it through my
[25:51.480 --> 25:54.560]  my shredders, my soil shredders and
[25:55.080 --> 25:59.400]  and then use that kind of as a as my kind of silica.
[26:00.520 --> 26:03.520]  Also, I'll do shredded bamboo and just use it as a top dress
[26:03.760 --> 26:08.320]  combined with alfalfa, and then they seem to just tear that up really good, too.
[26:09.440 --> 26:10.680]  But yeah, I don't get it.
[26:10.680 --> 26:12.320]  I don't buy a lot of stuff, guys.
[26:12.320 --> 26:14.440]  I'm not the guy on a lot of that.
[26:14.880 --> 26:16.160]  Those kind of questions.
[26:18.280 --> 26:20.640]  Yeah, that's more of like a commercial product,
[26:21.240 --> 26:23.240]  like commercial grows, I would imagine.
[26:23.560 --> 26:27.480]  I have personally used C90, though, for what it is.
[26:27.480 --> 26:28.720]  It's a fantastic product.
[26:28.720 --> 26:31.760]  And if you live in the mountains, it's worth the money.
[26:33.400 --> 26:34.760]  Again, it's just diversity.
[26:34.760 --> 26:37.600]  I mean, if you have a variety of ways, you're going on vacation with the family.
[26:37.600 --> 26:40.040]  You know, you can also take some seawater home with you.
[26:40.720 --> 26:43.240]  So just kind of planning out your life, planning out the year,
[26:44.000 --> 26:46.480]  finding friends that are willing to hook you up with some IMO
[26:46.480 --> 26:47.680]  so that you don't have to go out there.
[26:47.680 --> 26:50.480]  I mean, think of all the time and stuff that that saved.
[26:50.480 --> 26:53.840]  So just having this community, man, that was I guess why I kind of started off
[26:53.840 --> 26:56.480]  the show that way, Marco is this is really fun, man.
[26:56.480 --> 27:00.360]  I mean, it used to be something where we everybody would kind of be like, yeah, right.
[27:00.360 --> 27:04.920]  You can't use your same soil or it just there was too many negative things out there
[27:04.920 --> 27:08.480]  that all the whispers that probably hindered a lot of us from doing this
[27:08.480 --> 27:13.200]  for maybe even a couple of years, at least a year or two in my little network.
[27:13.760 --> 27:17.560]  We're just we were trying to do that using bagged soils,
[27:17.800 --> 27:20.880]  not understanding that we also needed that soil system
[27:21.560 --> 27:24.400]  so we would have horrific grows like the second and third flip.
[27:25.360 --> 27:28.800]  Exactly. I'm just trying to get the link pulled up on my phone.
[27:28.800 --> 27:33.200]  But definitely, man, like, you know, when I get when we go on vacay or whatever,
[27:33.240 --> 27:35.920]  you know, wife knows me.
[27:35.920 --> 27:40.840]  If I see a nice place, I'm like, if I see seawater, I'm going to get a water bottle.
[27:40.840 --> 27:42.520]  I'm going to roll up my pants.
[27:42.520 --> 27:46.160]  I'm going to go out there, usually no matter what the temperature is.
[27:47.200 --> 27:48.920]  Those are just experiences, man.
[27:48.920 --> 27:51.320]  You know what I mean? I did that when we were up in New England.
[27:52.000 --> 27:53.840]  It was just beautiful up there, too, by the way.
[27:53.840 --> 27:56.240]  I know a lot of y'all know that, but I didn't know that.
[27:56.240 --> 27:58.080]  That shit is beautiful.
[27:58.080 --> 28:01.840]  So we were up there on the coast, man, and water and air was so crisp.
[28:01.880 --> 28:03.920]  Grab some seawater.
[28:03.920 --> 28:05.120]  Take it back on a plane.
[28:05.120 --> 28:06.160]  Check it in your bag.
[28:06.160 --> 28:10.120]  Now I got some of that good, you know, North Atlantic seawater.
[28:11.120 --> 28:15.160]  Does it, you know, you know, if you think about does it make the difference?
[28:15.160 --> 28:16.200]  I don't know if it does.
[28:16.200 --> 28:17.720]  You know, does it help? Sure.
[28:17.720 --> 28:19.640]  You know, it's just experiences, though.
[28:19.640 --> 28:22.200]  It's about, you know, using what's available to you.
[28:22.480 --> 28:24.920]  And it's about showing others that like when I did that,
[28:24.920 --> 28:27.480]  somebody came up to me and it started a conversation.
[28:27.480 --> 28:29.120]  He's like, hey, man, what are you doing?
[28:29.120 --> 28:31.720]  You know, so now we got into natural farming.
[28:32.080 --> 28:34.240]  Just so happened, you know, a guy was a gardener.
[28:34.240 --> 28:37.240]  So now he's kind of thinking about what I'm saying.
[28:37.240 --> 28:40.520]  And maybe that'll spark something in him to, you know, continue
[28:40.520 --> 28:43.520]  kind of what we're doing. You know what I mean?
[28:43.520 --> 28:45.400]  You know, don't be shy about this stuff, guys.
[28:45.400 --> 28:49.320]  If you see some forest or something and you want to, you know,
[28:49.320 --> 28:52.400]  get a little piece of something, don't be don't be embarrassed.
[28:52.400 --> 28:54.680]  Go on up there. Get take care of your business.
[28:54.960 --> 28:56.400]  Do a little nature walk.
[28:56.400 --> 28:58.560]  You know, bring a plastic bag with you.
[28:58.560 --> 29:00.600]  Collect a few things. Bring them on back.
[29:00.880 --> 29:04.120]  You know, I mean, it's just all about, you know, experience is just
[29:04.600 --> 29:08.360]  it's just kind of like a journey, like a lot of people say, you know what I mean?
[29:10.760 --> 29:13.760]  Axel, I wanted to mention when you're using
[29:14.040 --> 29:17.320]  from my experience, when you're using aqua flakes,
[29:17.720 --> 29:20.920]  it made a drastic difference in the overall health of the plant.
[29:20.920 --> 29:25.320]  So I would imagine other synthetics, it probably makes quite a difference.
[29:25.920 --> 29:29.160]  But it's been so long since, you know, that would be the source
[29:29.160 --> 29:32.200]  or that would be, you know, the first thing that I would want to want to use.
[29:32.920 --> 29:35.800]  There's just so many other things and so many other free sources
[29:35.800 --> 29:40.720]  that are just more attractive now as you start to learn about these things.
[29:41.680 --> 29:45.160]  The better the source, man, the better, the better the end product,
[29:45.840 --> 29:48.120]  really, and no matter what you're doing when it comes to farm.
[29:48.960 --> 29:51.200]  Definitely not taking it from the bay.
[29:51.240 --> 29:54.680]  So just because like I live in Alberta, I can't
[29:55.320 --> 29:59.680]  or I don't have readily available saltwater coast that I can get.
[30:00.480 --> 30:07.320]  I take just normal RO water and I add salt as per what a KNF teaches.
[30:08.960 --> 30:12.320]  Is that like I know I'm not giving all of the biology
[30:12.320 --> 30:18.760]  that I would out of a seawater, but is there really that much difference?
[30:19.520 --> 30:21.240]  Should I make a trip to the coast?
[30:21.240 --> 30:22.840]  Should I order some in?
[30:22.880 --> 30:27.240]  What would be an option for somebody like me that is absolutely landlocked?
[30:28.400 --> 30:33.560]  I'll tell you can like for cooking our favorite sea salt that we found for flavor
[30:33.560 --> 30:38.120]  is called Malibu Gold and what it's it's
[30:38.120 --> 30:41.040]  it's harvested from the Straits of Cortez.
[30:41.080 --> 30:42.560]  It's all over there on the West Coast.
[30:42.560 --> 30:46.840]  So for me, getting something like a good quality table, sea salt,
[30:47.440 --> 30:50.640]  that's good quality and making your own is just as good.
[30:50.680 --> 30:51.320]  You know what I mean?
[30:51.320 --> 30:54.480]  If you can't make it to the ocean, I wouldn't do it just for that.
[30:54.480 --> 30:57.080]  But who doesn't want to go to the ocean anyway?
[30:57.160 --> 31:00.240]  You know, seven, 10, kind of.
[31:00.240 --> 31:03.240]  He's selling seawater. I love it.
[31:03.240 --> 31:06.480]  Yeah, man, I definitely do it out of salt table salt.
[31:09.780 --> 31:12.500]  You're muted, Ken. Yeah, you're mute.
[31:12.500 --> 31:17.020]  Sorry. Seven, 10, kind of got a shout out on John Burr Fellows video this morning.
[31:17.020 --> 31:20.260]  Just I guess he's a really nice guy.
[31:23.140 --> 31:28.220]  Very good. Before the show started, guys, I mentioned to both Brian and Marco,
[31:28.220 --> 31:31.860]  I made an FAA. It's at 11 months.
[31:32.300 --> 31:33.820]  It's never been open.
[31:33.820 --> 31:36.900]  And I'm going to open it live on the show.
[31:37.780 --> 31:42.220]  I do have air freshener just in case.
[31:42.740 --> 31:44.460]  Life's sitting beside me.
[31:44.460 --> 31:47.260]  And I have my clothes pin for my nose ready.
[31:48.100 --> 31:50.020]  OK, now this is wonderful.
[31:50.020 --> 31:52.140]  Let's set this up, everybody.
[31:52.300 --> 31:54.420]  This will be an unbiased opinion.
[31:54.780 --> 31:56.900]  Does FAA stink?
[31:56.900 --> 31:59.020]  This is going to be awesome.
[31:59.020 --> 32:02.740]  OK, now I got fish from a friend of mine.
[32:02.740 --> 32:05.020]  I put it in. I put in my sugar.
[32:06.180 --> 32:09.700]  And then over the next week to 10 days, I kept checking it,
[32:09.700 --> 32:12.500]  adding more sugar to cap it off.
[32:13.380 --> 32:16.820]  And then for the last, well, 10, 11 months,
[32:17.460 --> 32:20.540]  it's just been sitting in a bucket in my storage room.
[32:20.980 --> 32:24.220]  So this is going to be the first time I'm going to have the wife
[32:24.380 --> 32:27.140]  grab the camera so she can she can show it.
[32:27.620 --> 32:30.220]  Now, did you not did you add IMO three in there?
[32:30.220 --> 32:33.540]  Just just to show fish worm castings.
[32:33.540 --> 32:36.180]  I haven't made an IMO yet. Perfect.
[32:36.180 --> 32:39.500]  Oh, we'll see if the how it shows up here.
[32:43.140 --> 32:46.980]  No smell of vision, do I know it's going to smell so good.
[32:46.980 --> 32:48.580]  It is. No, she's going to love it.
[32:49.580 --> 32:55.740]  Yeah. OK, we got no light here, so let's go like that.
[32:57.260 --> 32:59.580]  All right. Now break that crust and you see,
[32:59.580 --> 33:01.860]  you see how good it is right below that crust.
[33:02.460 --> 33:04.620]  Oh, God, do I use my finger?
[33:04.620 --> 33:06.500]  Yeah. And then you could taste it.
[33:06.500 --> 33:10.020]  You trust the process.
[33:10.020 --> 33:14.980]  OK, it was just a nice it looks almost like maple syrup.
[33:15.300 --> 33:18.420]  Let's see that finger. Oh, yeah.
[33:18.500 --> 33:21.580]  Nice. Now, if you taste it, it's delicious,
[33:21.580 --> 33:25.580]  but you will have a little bit of a fish mouth for about 35, 40 minutes.
[33:28.300 --> 33:30.620]  Tastes really sugary, actually.
[33:30.620 --> 33:32.740]  Sweet, right? A little hint of fish in there.
[33:33.340 --> 33:35.900]  Yeah, just just a very little bit.
[33:36.180 --> 33:40.820]  Like, as I understand it, it's supposed to be a recipe that
[33:42.100 --> 33:47.580]  they came up with that they make fish sauce like the really expensive fish sauce.
[33:47.660 --> 33:49.220]  Oh, mommy. Yes.
[33:49.220 --> 33:51.420]  Yeah. This is the same basic recipe, right?
[33:51.740 --> 33:52.740]  Yeah, pretty much.
[33:52.740 --> 33:55.660]  Because every time I make it, there was a sauce.
[33:55.900 --> 33:57.380]  Oh, no. Yeah. Yeah.
[33:57.380 --> 33:59.540]  Yeah, that shit is good, man.
[33:59.540 --> 34:01.980]  Same thing on the sushi.
[34:02.860 --> 34:05.300]  Yeah. Lily says it doesn't smell at all.
[34:05.780 --> 34:07.620]  Boom. You want to taste? No.
[34:10.180 --> 34:12.780]  We'll just leave it at it doesn't smell.
[34:12.780 --> 34:15.540]  So now I know that Dr.
[34:15.540 --> 34:20.020]  Drake there who's over in in Hawaii, he says that,
[34:21.300 --> 34:24.660]  you know, to leave it for the full year, the full 12 months.
[34:24.700 --> 34:29.420]  But some people are saying they can use it at, you know, four or five or six months.
[34:30.660 --> 34:32.740]  What's your opinion on that, Marco?
[34:32.980 --> 34:34.460]  Any clinics, please?
[34:34.460 --> 34:36.780]  I like to let it wait.
[34:36.780 --> 34:38.260]  I like to let it wait, man.
[34:38.260 --> 34:41.860]  I like to go the year 10 months, you know, get up there.
[34:41.900 --> 34:44.780]  Double digit months, you know, for me.
[34:45.380 --> 34:46.660]  Yes, you can use it.
[34:46.660 --> 34:49.780]  It's valuable before that. Yes, it has some value.
[34:50.100 --> 34:53.980]  But to me, if you're just really wanting to get a quality FAA,
[34:53.980 --> 34:56.380]  let it go the whole year and you get a really nice one.
[34:57.020 --> 35:00.060]  Well, May 30th, this is will be the full year.
[35:00.420 --> 35:02.020]  OK, so you're you're right there.
[35:02.020 --> 35:04.420]  So when you get that close, you're calling that done.
[35:05.460 --> 35:07.380]  OK, OK. And then it gets better.
[35:07.380 --> 35:11.060]  Like I have some, you know, almost three years old and just leave it in the bucket.
[35:11.060 --> 35:12.700]  It just keeps getting better, you know.
[35:12.700 --> 35:16.860]  And as I understand it, the longer you leave it,
[35:16.860 --> 35:19.420]  the less you actually have to use for percentage.
[35:19.660 --> 35:23.420]  Do you have a chart or something or is there a chart on that kind of thing?
[35:23.740 --> 35:25.420]  I believe there is a chart.
[35:25.420 --> 35:27.700]  I know there's a chart. The K&F guys have it.
[35:28.100 --> 35:30.340]  I know Drake has some charts.
[35:30.340 --> 35:34.420]  I don't have a chart because it might start with the one to one thousand.
[35:34.420 --> 35:39.020]  And I increase that or decrease it depending on how strong I'm feeding.
[35:39.020 --> 35:40.900]  And I and that's part of the. Yeah.
[35:40.980 --> 35:44.100]  So we're kind of just it's just different ways to do it.
[35:44.100 --> 35:46.580]  But there's some very strict, you know, one to one thousand.
[35:46.580 --> 35:51.140]  I think by years, I think it decreases by half every year, maybe or four
[35:51.140 --> 35:54.020]  or a quarter less, but I'm not 100 percent sure.
[35:54.700 --> 35:57.780]  OK, OK. I couldn't remember the numbers.
[35:58.060 --> 36:01.860]  Now, I do have a question on labs like I make my own labs.
[36:01.860 --> 36:05.820]  I actually started that before I even started growing cannabis
[36:06.500 --> 36:11.300]  because it's the the lactic acid bacteria that we're most in tune with.
[36:12.260 --> 36:16.580]  Like I, of course, take it myself and it's helping my teeth and my nails, etc.
[36:17.100 --> 36:20.460]  But for the cannabis plant or for any plant,
[36:20.940 --> 36:24.900]  for that matter, is that form of calcium close enough
[36:24.900 --> 36:28.660]  to the chemical formulation that the plant would use
[36:29.100 --> 36:32.380]  to really make it helpful to our plant?
[36:32.380 --> 36:38.220]  Or are we just using it as a bio stimulant or or something of that nature?
[36:38.220 --> 36:40.740]  And I'll jump back out and you guys can discuss that.
[36:44.880 --> 36:48.360]  Yeah, I mean, I think so, Ken, I think even if it's
[36:48.440 --> 36:52.680]  even if it ends up just being dissolved to a point in the solution,
[36:52.680 --> 36:56.560]  then it's going to it's breaking it down that much smaller for the soil biology
[36:56.560 --> 36:59.440]  to be able to then break it down into plant available form.
[36:59.880 --> 37:01.640]  So, yeah, I think it's a valid input.
[37:01.640 --> 37:08.120]  I don't weigh too heavily on it as far as like needing WCA throughout my grow
[37:08.120 --> 37:10.880]  because I you know, just the kind of the way I build my soil.
[37:11.480 --> 37:13.600]  I feel like I have have that built into it.
[37:14.640 --> 37:17.000]  I use a lot of, you know,
[37:17.000 --> 37:21.400]  vinegars, you know, just different different ways about to go about,
[37:21.920 --> 37:26.320]  you know, growing. But for me, WCA is a great input, you know,
[37:26.440 --> 37:30.560]  and it's not one that for me is going to, you know,
[37:30.880 --> 37:32.800]  make or break my grow, I don't think.
[37:32.800 --> 37:37.560]  But I'll use it a couple of times, you know, during a growth cycle.
[37:39.120 --> 37:43.720]  OK, so when you generally use it, are you using it just through flower,
[37:43.720 --> 37:45.840]  using it through veg?
[37:45.840 --> 37:48.320]  When you generally actually use it?
[37:48.320 --> 37:50.240]  Yeah, I'll use it throughout veg.
[37:50.240 --> 37:53.520]  And then when I go to flower, I'll go to WCAP
[37:54.000 --> 37:56.240]  Cal Foss with, you know, from bones.
[37:56.440 --> 38:00.440]  So I kind of do my calcium stuff in veg because I if anything,
[38:00.440 --> 38:04.360]  you know, if they have calcium doesn't move that much in the plant.
[38:04.360 --> 38:07.560]  So I try to get it in, you know, in there in the veg stage.
[38:07.880 --> 38:11.840]  That way, by time flowering is kind of set, you know, in the plant
[38:11.840 --> 38:15.480]  and not trying to move up and down and in that way.
[38:18.400 --> 38:21.640]  So, yeah, you know, that's kind of my ideas on that.
[38:21.880 --> 38:23.040]  What do you think, Brian?
[38:23.040 --> 38:27.120]  I mean, that's a very, you know, easy input to make it very satisfying
[38:27.120 --> 38:29.240]  one to see made to.
[38:29.240 --> 38:33.120]  Yeah, I think we said almost every other show or something,
[38:33.120 --> 38:34.320]  you know, calcium is king.
[38:34.320 --> 38:37.000]  It should probably be the fourth macro, in my opinion.
[38:37.600 --> 38:40.360]  So anytime that you can add calcium
[38:40.360 --> 38:42.360]  without being, you know, overly
[38:43.360 --> 38:45.120]  don't or was more on.
[38:45.120 --> 38:45.880]  There we go.
[38:45.880 --> 38:48.800]  When Leighton's talking about being a moron, that's what he's kind of getting at.
[38:48.800 --> 38:51.880]  Is it like when you first get into this, you start to think like, oh, if I had this
[38:51.880 --> 38:54.680]  calcium, oh, I see a little bit of health improvement.
[38:55.200 --> 38:57.880]  Now I need to go crazy and add all these different amendments.
[38:58.440 --> 38:59.600]  And that's not what we're saying.
[38:59.600 --> 39:05.000]  And I think what with kind of getting next level amendments
[39:05.000 --> 39:09.000]  and making your own calcium inputs is just going to allow you
[39:09.000 --> 39:11.480]  to have that tool set if needed.
[39:11.480 --> 39:16.040]  But IMO, in my opinion, is where my time and effort would be focused on
[39:16.040 --> 39:19.720]  if I was really trying to build things up is just mastering that
[39:19.720 --> 39:21.360]  at the level that that Marco has.
[39:21.360 --> 39:25.000]  So they actually have the the trichomes in the IMO world, man.
[39:25.000 --> 39:27.400]  People are that's hard to do, brother.
[39:27.400 --> 39:30.480]  So again, hats off to you, Marco, because that's the kind of stuff that we
[39:30.920 --> 39:33.760]  I think the community wants to see, man, is that holy shit, like
[39:34.040 --> 39:38.480]  people can continue to improve this, you know, just like cannabis continues to improve.
[39:38.640 --> 39:42.080]  I didn't see IMO with trichomes on on it,
[39:42.640 --> 39:44.240]  you know, just even a few years ago.
[39:44.240 --> 39:48.960]  So just the community as a whole is dramatically improving
[39:49.400 --> 39:53.560]  just based on these kind of shows and outlets and a variety of other podcasts
[39:53.560 --> 39:56.160]  and shows and stuff is just the talent is out there.
[39:56.160 --> 39:58.880]  And the more that people play around with different calciums and stuff,
[39:59.080 --> 40:01.120]  you're going to see that improvement.
[40:01.120 --> 40:05.200]  I still from my experience, I felt like when I would pinch the main stocks
[40:05.560 --> 40:08.760]  early and veg allow that knuckle to start to build up.
[40:09.040 --> 40:12.520]  It did seem like those plants were health healthier with calcium.
[40:12.520 --> 40:15.920]  It did seem like those things were stored up so that when she did need that,
[40:15.920 --> 40:17.320]  she would pull from there.
[40:17.320 --> 40:21.080]  I think I've learned that other people might have a different opinion on that.
[40:21.320 --> 40:24.760]  But from my experience, it did seem like the plants, when everything was healthy,
[40:24.760 --> 40:27.040]  that they responded pretty well to that kind of stress.
[40:28.120 --> 40:29.560]  Yeah, that power knuckle.
[40:29.560 --> 40:32.240]  I do it all the time. I'll do it all through veg.
[40:32.240 --> 40:36.600]  I'll just crush, crush, crush, crush, crush, like all around, just randomly.
[40:36.840 --> 40:39.480]  And it just the stems get thick and gnarly.
[40:39.480 --> 40:41.600]  And I think it helps.
[40:41.600 --> 40:44.280]  Yeah, I think I'd have to agree with that.
[40:45.040 --> 40:48.520]  You know, I've I've had a lot that I've had to bend over
[40:49.120 --> 40:52.680]  just for height wise, and it's it's really helped the strength.
[40:52.800 --> 40:57.160]  And you can see when they turn back up, it's really a lot stronger.
[40:57.160 --> 41:00.160]  Now, as for the labs, it wasn't the labs for the teeth.
[41:00.200 --> 41:04.400]  It was the WCA, the water soluble calcium.
[41:05.680 --> 41:09.320]  And I was actually taking some calcium phosphate after that as well.
[41:11.120 --> 41:15.040]  So now I have an old WCA
[41:15.040 --> 41:18.120]  that I've had on my counter and it started to grow
[41:18.920 --> 41:20.480]  fungus, et cetera, on top.
[41:20.480 --> 41:24.040]  Now, as I understand it, that's still perfectly good for my plants.
[41:24.200 --> 41:26.800]  I made a new one for myself,
[41:26.800 --> 41:28.400]  but I just wanted to confirm that.
[41:28.400 --> 41:30.600]  Yes, that is actually good for my plants still.
[41:30.880 --> 41:32.320]  Yeah, I use those.
[41:32.320 --> 41:36.080]  My WCA will get that kind of funky growing on it, too.
[41:36.160 --> 41:41.040]  And I'll keep using it because in my mindset is the calcium still in there.
[41:41.040 --> 41:42.720]  You know, nothing really came out.
[41:42.720 --> 41:46.000]  Just got some extra little fungus or mold, whatever that may be.
[41:46.480 --> 41:50.320]  Nothing is going to be enough to do a detriment to my soil,
[41:50.320 --> 41:53.480]  even if it was something that wasn't, you know, beneficial.
[41:53.480 --> 41:55.640]  So, yeah, it goes right on in.
[41:55.800 --> 41:57.880]  Let the microbes tear it on up.
[41:59.960 --> 42:01.480]  IMO box out of.
[42:01.480 --> 42:03.840]  Come on, seven, ten.
[42:04.440 --> 42:06.680]  You know how to build an IMO box, man.
[42:06.680 --> 42:11.280]  Go get you a fence, get you a piece of cedar fence from Lowe's or Home Depot.
[42:11.720 --> 42:13.080]  Eight foot cedar fence.
[42:13.080 --> 42:15.400]  It's like four inches by eight foot.
[42:15.400 --> 42:16.920]  Let's cut that in the slats.
[42:16.920 --> 42:18.920]  Make that your sides and your bottom.
[42:19.080 --> 42:20.880]  Boom, you're done.
[42:25.320 --> 42:29.560]  So, yeah, boxes, key wicker boxes are cool, too, man.
[42:29.560 --> 42:33.040]  I was at a craft shop, craft store or whatever with the wife.
[42:33.040 --> 42:36.240]  They got tons of like kind of like wicker baskets and stuff.
[42:36.640 --> 42:40.240]  And I saw some of those like, damn, it'd be cool collection boxes.
[42:40.240 --> 42:43.360]  So, you know, collection boxes are kind of where you find them.
[42:43.360 --> 42:46.440]  Find one that's pretty sturdy.
[42:46.440 --> 42:50.760]  Yeah, and those kind of places usually have like awesome coupons
[42:50.760 --> 42:53.240]  for like the Karen's of the world that go in there all the time.
[42:53.240 --> 42:55.200]  So you keep your eye out on that stuff.
[42:55.200 --> 42:58.400]  You can probably get it for fairly cheap, man, every now and then.
[42:59.280 --> 43:01.800]  Some of those coupons never expire, too.
[43:01.800 --> 43:03.400]  So there you go. Yeah, exactly.
[43:03.400 --> 43:05.760]  Michael's and other craft stores like that.
[43:06.320 --> 43:06.760]  Yeah.
[43:07.680 --> 43:13.960]  Coco, IMO is freaking hard, almost impossible as a closet grower.
[43:15.320 --> 43:16.600]  Well, it's not that hard.
[43:16.600 --> 43:18.440]  You got to go outside, my man.
[43:18.440 --> 43:21.480]  You got even though your closet grow or you got to take that little
[43:21.480 --> 43:25.560]  that little hike out in your local park, go out in your woods,
[43:25.600 --> 43:30.640]  take a little nature walk, bring a small IMO collection with you, hide it out there.
[43:31.480 --> 43:34.240]  Walk back out there again in two days.
[43:35.000 --> 43:37.480]  Check it. Walk back out there the next day.
[43:37.560 --> 43:38.720]  You know what I mean?
[43:38.720 --> 43:40.160]  And nothing there's nothing hard.
[43:40.160 --> 43:45.280]  It's just about going out and making it happen and being being resourceful.
[43:45.280 --> 43:48.200]  Also, your closet grower, if you can't get outside,
[43:48.200 --> 43:50.760]  I make it sound easy, some people can't move around.
[43:51.280 --> 43:55.600]  If you have a cool old cooler, if you have some of your good soil,
[43:56.320 --> 43:58.920]  you can put that soil in the bottom of that cooler.
[43:59.520 --> 44:02.880]  You can now put your rice collection on that and you can take that.
[44:02.880 --> 44:05.200]  And now you can make yourself an IMO, too.
[44:06.000 --> 44:09.000]  And now people say, well, why is that valuable?
[44:09.000 --> 44:11.000]  Because I already have that IMO that's in the soil.
[44:11.000 --> 44:12.960]  But what it does is it gives you that input.
[44:12.960 --> 44:15.280]  Now you have that IMO, too, in a jar.
[44:15.280 --> 44:18.960]  Now you got that input to work with with different things that you're doing.
[44:19.440 --> 44:22.600]  And that's going to make you want to know, oh, IMO three, how do we do that?
[44:22.720 --> 44:25.160]  Or you got to have IMO two to make IMO three.
[44:26.200 --> 44:28.640]  So it's all about just mindset, guys.
[44:28.640 --> 44:30.960]  This stuff is not hard.
[44:31.160 --> 44:33.840]  Marco, do you think when you're when you're adding water
[44:33.840 --> 44:39.200]  to like a dry IMO substrate that that also whatever's going on with that,
[44:39.200 --> 44:41.560]  when things first start to kick off, it seems like
[44:41.840 --> 44:46.080]  from my experience, the fungus gnat populations come down as well.
[44:48.000 --> 44:51.360]  Is there something within that that we don't maybe there is beneficials,
[44:51.880 --> 44:55.560]  obviously, like that's skidamist, the hypiosis miles.
[44:55.560 --> 44:57.520]  I know that was super beneficial.
[44:57.520 --> 45:00.240]  I hadn't added rove beetles yet, which I did add that now.
[45:00.240 --> 45:02.440]  And obviously it's gone down even more.
[45:02.440 --> 45:06.680]  But I was just wondering if normally on outdoor IMO, are you norm?
[45:06.720 --> 45:09.520]  Are you finding the kind of things that we've been spending a lot of money
[45:09.520 --> 45:14.360]  from some of these insectaries and beneficials and spending a lot of money on?
[45:15.120 --> 45:17.320]  Yeah, yeah, man, actually, yes.
[45:17.320 --> 45:19.640]  And I just noticed some today, actually.
[45:20.120 --> 45:21.520]  You know, I love my rove beetles.
[45:21.520 --> 45:23.680]  Robeel rove beetles are, you know, they're everywhere.
[45:23.680 --> 45:26.880]  They're outdoors, all different sizes, species, varieties.
[45:26.880 --> 45:29.280]  And what they are, they go all throughout your soil.
[45:29.520 --> 45:31.720]  Little hunters are just going through their eating
[45:32.280 --> 45:36.880]  things like fungus, not larvae like like Brian's talking about.
[45:37.800 --> 45:39.720]  So rove beetles are very beneficial.
[45:39.720 --> 45:45.160]  I bought them just when I made soils just so I'm, you know, to make sure I had them,
[45:45.160 --> 45:47.960]  you know, have healthy populations in my soil.
[45:48.720 --> 45:54.360]  Just earlier today, I posted on my IGA, I picked up an old IMO rice collection.
[45:54.480 --> 45:55.440]  I forgot about it.
[45:55.440 --> 45:57.360]  Set out there, I think, four or five days.
[45:58.040 --> 45:59.520]  Forgot about it. Harvested it.
[45:59.520 --> 46:02.400]  Put it on a plate so I can kind of see what was going on.
[46:02.840 --> 46:05.840]  And I counted like four rove beetles just on that, you know,
[46:06.080 --> 46:08.000]  on a small rice collection.
[46:08.000 --> 46:12.600]  So, I mean, I took that plate into my into my grow,
[46:12.680 --> 46:15.200]  knock those rove beetles right off into my soil.
[46:15.240 --> 46:18.320]  You know, I mean, it's that valuable to me now.
[46:18.320 --> 46:21.960]  I have four. I don't know what kind they were, but I have four different rove beetles
[46:21.960 --> 46:24.320]  now that my soil didn't have before.
[46:24.320 --> 46:26.760]  You know, we're always talking about that diversity.
[46:27.080 --> 46:31.120]  So, yeah, I mean, if I could find a way now to grow them, I see they came to the rice,
[46:31.120 --> 46:32.920]  which was pretty cool.
[46:32.920 --> 46:37.480]  Now, if we can get a way to kind of multiply those, keep me from buying that.
[46:37.480 --> 46:42.440]  I want to ask the audience that does anybody out there know how to tried and true way
[46:42.440 --> 46:44.200]  to breed rove beetles?
[46:44.200 --> 46:50.040]  Because I've asked some of those people at the cannabis expos and they don't want to tell you that.
[46:50.640 --> 46:56.720]  So if there's anybody out there that successfully bred them, I've tried a few things, even from a gentleman in Oklahoma that,
[46:57.480 --> 46:59.120]  you know, he does like living soil stuff.
[46:59.120 --> 47:01.080]  His name his name escapes me.
[47:01.080 --> 47:08.720]  But he put out like a tutorial with I think it was just like a carbohydrate source in rove beetles.
[47:08.720 --> 47:10.080]  And I didn't have success with that.
[47:10.520 --> 47:12.840]  I don't know if you if you've tried that or anything.
[47:13.080 --> 47:16.040]  I think it was like using like oatmeal and stuff and a little bit of soil.
[47:16.520 --> 47:18.040]  Yeah, I've heard the oatmeal.
[47:19.040 --> 47:22.320]  You know, I did try it and I don't know.
[47:22.440 --> 47:26.560]  It didn't really I don't know if I didn't put enough time into it or what.
[47:26.600 --> 47:27.480]  You know what I mean?
[47:28.280 --> 47:29.600]  Yeah. Staphylin today.
[47:29.720 --> 47:31.640]  Yeah, that's rove beetle.
[47:31.640 --> 47:36.680]  And there's not a million, but there's thousands of lots of different ones, all kinds.
[47:36.680 --> 47:41.000]  But yeah, Bobby Jones is saying peat moss and damp oats.
[47:41.320 --> 47:51.280]  So when you when you've tried that and it didn't work out like are we is the are we maybe maybe I'm going to it's a little too wet, a little too dry, because that's what everybody says.
[47:51.560 --> 47:53.640]  Marco is the damp oats.
[47:53.640 --> 47:57.360]  And well, here's what here's what I should do then.
[47:58.080 --> 48:06.080]  So what I needed to do was that when I collected those four, I should set up a little content, a little confinement for them.
[48:06.680 --> 48:08.240]  Damp oats and peat moss.
[48:08.360 --> 48:10.640]  Throw those four in there and just leave it in there.
[48:10.640 --> 48:11.520]  See what happens.
[48:11.520 --> 48:23.040]  You know, I think it might be as simple as that is like literally taking some rove beetles, trying different substrates, have six different containers until you figure out kind of, oh, now I got 10 in here where I did.
[48:23.960 --> 48:25.240]  You know, these all died.
[48:26.240 --> 48:30.400]  Peat moss is a substrate to live in a damp oats, barley, et cetera, for the.
[48:30.400 --> 48:31.560]  Yeah, they like the rice.
[48:31.560 --> 48:32.920]  They were eating all my rice collection.
[48:32.920 --> 48:41.720]  And when I so when I've experimented with that, when I have the damp food, that's when all the fungus gnats come and then it gets ridiculous.
[48:42.280 --> 48:47.320]  So I was that's why I was wondering I was going to play around more with having springtails in there.
[48:47.360 --> 48:52.520]  So from what I understand, the rove beetles will eat the springtails as well to kind of help build up the populations.
[48:52.760 --> 48:56.880]  And obviously, springtails would eat that that mold if that started out.
[48:57.640 --> 49:01.040]  So I don't I don't know.
[49:01.040 --> 49:05.720]  Probably a multi-level approach, right?
[49:05.760 --> 49:08.640]  Like you got to hit it different ways is kind of what it seems like.
[49:09.880 --> 49:17.840]  Or I've had more success when when when you normally talk about breeding springtails, everybody says like charcoal or clay.
[49:18.040 --> 49:21.040]  But I've personally seen better results when I put it on soil.
[49:21.520 --> 49:23.800]  So that's what I also wanted to do with the rove beetles.
[49:23.800 --> 49:31.040]  I have a little experiment going downstairs with it, but it does seem like it takes forever for them to really like churn.
[49:31.040 --> 49:34.040]  And I'm saying like probably a few months I've noticed, Marco.
[49:35.120 --> 49:43.000]  And then I haven't really had success with them staying at that at that level of where, you know, you really notice them with the naked eye.
[49:43.560 --> 49:46.640]  The population is always to kind of seem to crumble and fall back down.
[49:47.640 --> 49:57.320]  Yeah, I get what you're saying, to keep them up at that high population, I can still find them when I look at my soil, but you kind of I guess they get their balance out, man, it's like a lion.
[49:57.320 --> 50:02.560]  A lion can only be how small of a piece of a land can a lion live on?
[50:02.560 --> 50:03.840]  It's probably the same with them.
[50:03.840 --> 50:12.080]  They probably are so voracious that, you know, you can only have so many per square foot or something that just by natural selection.
[50:13.080 --> 50:23.080]  But yes, I think, man, just going back to breeding them, I think it's something more along the lines of getting them into a container with whatever substrate.
[50:23.080 --> 50:31.080]  And then key is having that pre-inoculated so that you know that you don't have the fungus gnats in it.
[50:31.080 --> 50:31.760]  You know what I mean?
[50:31.760 --> 50:36.600]  So you're hitting that with that Bt, letting it sit for three weeks so it can cycle out.
[50:36.600 --> 50:39.320]  Now you're going in with that clean substrate.
[50:39.320 --> 50:40.600]  Maybe that's the way to do it.
[50:42.200 --> 50:47.800]  But if you got rove beetles, you would think they would eat the fungus gnat larvae, so you shouldn't really have that bloom.
[50:47.800 --> 50:48.600]  It's kind of tough.
[50:50.240 --> 51:01.280]  Yeah, it's definitely a Goldilocks approach with that, because if you have too much food, the fungus gnats come, but then if you don't have enough of the rove beetles, it's just like the colony itself won't take off.
[51:01.280 --> 51:07.800]  So it's almost like you need the fungus gnats at first for the rove beetles to really take off.
[51:07.800 --> 51:08.960]  And then they eat all that.
[51:08.960 --> 51:13.040]  And then I don't know what happens, whether they eat each other or there's just not enough food and they die off.
[51:13.400 --> 51:16.160]  And remember, rove beetles will fly on you, too.
[51:16.320 --> 51:19.120]  So if they're not happy, they'll just fly.
[51:19.120 --> 51:25.000]  And if they're in your indoor grow, they may fly to the edge of the tent and end up dying, falling down or something.
[51:25.000 --> 51:25.840]  You know, who knows?
[51:25.840 --> 51:28.600]  But yeah, that's one thing about them.
[51:28.600 --> 51:29.800]  They will roll out on you.
[51:30.800 --> 51:43.440]  Well, remember the predator prey model, guys, you have to have the food source first for the next round of biology or arthropods to come in to be able to consume and survive.
[51:43.440 --> 51:45.920]  So you got to have one before the next one.
[51:46.440 --> 51:47.400]  Yeah, true.
[51:50.160 --> 51:51.880]  Weedless worms are easy.
[51:53.040 --> 51:56.920]  Are blue-green molds and IMO2 a sign of contamination?
[51:57.400 --> 51:59.480]  I don't know.
[51:59.480 --> 52:05.560]  It may be a sign that you went a little long if you have too many blue-green molds.
[52:06.480 --> 52:09.560]  If you have just a couple, I don't think it's bad.
[52:10.200 --> 52:11.720]  You want, you know, a good white.
[52:11.720 --> 52:12.560]  You want fuzz.
[52:12.560 --> 52:13.880]  You know, fuzz is your fungi.
[52:13.880 --> 52:14.840]  That's your mycelium.
[52:14.840 --> 52:15.960]  That's what you're going for.
[52:16.520 --> 52:21.520]  Some of the colors are your molds and your bacterias and different colonies of that.
[52:21.840 --> 52:24.200]  Not what we're necessarily going for here.
[52:24.200 --> 52:25.200]  We want the fungi.
[52:25.200 --> 52:33.840]  So if you've got a high amount of that good white mycelium compared to other colors, I think that's a great collection.
[52:34.200 --> 52:35.800]  Even but if you look at some of Dr.
[52:35.800 --> 52:39.400]  Cho's stuff, he shows you a rainbow collection and they're proud of that.
[52:39.400 --> 52:39.960]  They love it.
[52:39.960 --> 52:43.360]  So, you know, what do you do?
[52:43.360 --> 52:47.360]  I prefer a little bit more white, but I take a little diversity in mind.
[52:48.240 --> 52:53.800]  Why do some people also then say that it's the rainbow of death and that you want only pure white?
[52:54.440 --> 52:57.400]  Or are they just maybe misunderstanding things or?
[52:58.120 --> 53:10.120]  Well, when when you take the principles such as, you know, good and bad are equal when things are in balance, you know, so he's feeling like whatever collection he's taken, he's confident in that he collected what was there.
[53:10.520 --> 53:14.240]  So, you know, if you collect what was there, you trust the process.
[53:14.240 --> 53:19.200]  Then I wouldn't call it a I wouldn't say it's a that's harsh.
[53:19.320 --> 53:26.560]  But someone saying that their stuff died because they got a bad IMO collection, like their soil biology collapsed or something, that's rough.
[53:26.720 --> 53:31.320]  No, I think what they're saying is that when you see that, that's a failed IMO collection.
[53:31.320 --> 53:32.280]  OK, yeah.
[53:32.280 --> 53:35.600]  To most likely it stayed out too long when it's really colorful.
[53:35.800 --> 53:43.840]  If you look at my I.G., the one I did today, I I tell you, I said this is not a good collection, but I found some rogue beetles.
[53:43.840 --> 53:44.880]  So it worked out pretty cool.
[53:44.880 --> 53:46.480]  Also, some feather wing beetles.
[53:46.840 --> 53:48.680]  There was a feather wing beetle in there, too.
[53:49.200 --> 53:52.000]  Which are pretty cool to have in your soil.
[53:52.960 --> 53:58.920]  So I added some black soldier fly larvae into my my my big isopod bins.
[53:59.000 --> 54:05.920]  How long does that process usually take, you think, to go from larvae stage to, you know, beneficial stage?
[54:06.360 --> 54:08.920]  OK, so you added live larvae in there.
[54:09.400 --> 54:12.000]  All right. So you're going to have a house full of black soldier flies.
[54:12.000 --> 54:15.080]  You got to catch them every day, but let it release them outside.
[54:16.000 --> 54:22.960]  But so but what you can do, though, if you're worried, like literally everyone is going to turn into a black soldier fly.
[54:23.320 --> 54:27.800]  So if you want to catch them, you could drill a hole in the top corner of your bin and put a net on it.
[54:27.880 --> 54:30.120]  And when the adults hatch, they go to the light.
[54:30.320 --> 54:35.760]  And so they'll go in this net bag and release them outside or feed them to your whatever you want to do with them.
[54:35.920 --> 54:37.080]  I release mine outside.
[54:37.080 --> 54:44.040]  But that's about a twenty one, twenty, twenty, nineteen or twenty one day from larvae all the way up to hatching.
[54:44.760 --> 54:49.640]  Aren't they going to eat the fungus gnats as well when they're kind of just now?
[54:49.640 --> 54:50.960]  They won't eat fungus gnats.
[54:50.960 --> 54:57.960]  But what they do is they'll outcompete everything like other flies won't be around anymore, like no flies.
[54:59.160 --> 55:05.360]  Maybe they eat them if they fit in their mouth or when they become soup, because they're basically just slurping up soup is all they do.
[55:06.160 --> 55:09.400]  So but now they don't they don't go after them and eat them.
[55:10.400 --> 55:19.960]  Because I've used the frass for probably a decade or so, but the actual like insect itself, you know, I never played around with that.
[55:19.960 --> 55:21.600]  And they were they were kind of large.
[55:22.120 --> 55:23.000]  Yeah, they're big.
[55:23.800 --> 55:29.000]  So if they're large, then they're those ones you have may hatch in as little as a week to a week.
[55:29.200 --> 55:36.360]  If they're dark brown, the larger dark brown ones no longer whitish, then, yeah, they're getting closer to hatching.
[55:36.560 --> 55:41.160]  And so if I have them, I can I can open the basement window, they'll just fly out, obviously.
[55:41.560 --> 55:43.640]  Yeah, they'll they'll also go to light.
[55:43.640 --> 55:50.080]  So if you just shut all the lights off and you want to just leave an open window, then every day they'll just head out when they hatch.
[55:50.440 --> 55:56.600]  If not, like they'll be all around your light or in your like like I use a lot of their frass in my indoor.
[55:56.920 --> 56:02.400]  So like literally like every day, almost I find an adult in there and go in and grab and throw them outside.
[56:02.840 --> 56:04.160]  You know, it's just part of it.
[56:05.160 --> 56:09.280]  I was going to feed it to my bearded dragon, but I guess I was misinformed.
[56:09.280 --> 56:11.680]  I thought they also would take care of fungus gnats.
[56:12.840 --> 56:14.360]  No, I never heard that one, Brian.
[56:14.360 --> 56:19.520]  I've done a lot of reading on black soldier fly and hear that when only that they will outcompete them.
[56:19.520 --> 56:31.240]  And now if you have them, I feel like there's actually a bio biochemical that they produce, which deters other flies from coming into their feeding area when they're feeding heavily.
[56:32.240 --> 56:40.480]  And they like leafy like comfries or alfalfa, anything wet, leafy, decaying kind of that.
[56:41.040 --> 56:43.320]  Yeah, sadly, I'm going for old growth forest.
[56:43.320 --> 56:45.800]  So I was hoping that they'd just break down the leaves.
[56:47.000 --> 56:48.960]  They'll eat. They'll get in there and work all that.
[56:49.040 --> 56:49.800]  They'll work it out.
[56:50.080 --> 56:53.560]  They'll work it out because when they when what they do is the adults.
[56:53.560 --> 56:58.120]  So the pupae, they feed like on whatever they're feeding on.
[56:58.920 --> 57:04.280]  They grow to a point when they start getting that brown color, they're actually looking to go into the soil.
[57:04.840 --> 57:10.960]  So if you have them and you bought them in a brown state, what's going to happen is they're going to go into the soil and pupate.
[57:11.000 --> 57:12.200]  They're just going to hatch on.
[57:13.080 --> 57:14.480]  So they're just going to start hatching.
[57:14.480 --> 57:15.000]  That's all.
[57:15.000 --> 57:15.840]  I know. Big deal.
[57:15.840 --> 57:19.280]  But you there'll be be ready to release them.
[57:20.760 --> 57:21.280]  You know.
[57:22.880 --> 57:26.000]  And they live a long time in the soil, man, I was really surprised.
[57:26.440 --> 57:29.240]  Yeah. So it's still a beneficial thing.
[57:29.240 --> 57:30.520]  I didn't just shoot. Yeah.
[57:30.960 --> 57:32.880]  No, no. One hundred percent beneficial.
[57:32.880 --> 57:35.160]  Yeah. You're definitely on the beneficial tip.
[57:35.520 --> 57:49.640]  I just feel like for what you're doing, if you're if you have the young stages of growth, when they're like looking like maggots, like fly maggots, still that small growth, that's when they're feeding voraciously.
[57:50.280 --> 57:59.640]  When they've turned brown to that dark color and they're getting big now, they're going to that that that pupa stage, that final stage, and that adult's going to hatch out of that.
[57:59.640 --> 58:07.760]  So if you want the benefit, look for them younger, smaller if you want for decomposition or composting.
[58:10.280 --> 58:19.600]  And they come in and look, hey, if you in your backyard, if you stuff your bucket, they'll come and stuff it with some leafy greens.
[58:20.400 --> 58:22.000]  Everything loves avocado.
[58:22.360 --> 58:23.240]  That's what I've learned.
[58:23.520 --> 58:25.120]  Everything. Yeah, it does.
[58:26.360 --> 58:27.480]  Yes, it does.
[58:29.000 --> 58:35.920]  Yeah, I did like a huge version of, you know, avocado tech, everybody knows you can't take avocado, lay it face down on the soil.
[58:36.640 --> 58:40.920]  Some people fill them with different things, different IMOs, different foods.
[58:41.240 --> 58:47.160]  And what that does, it does a great job of just pulling everything up from the soil that comes up to that avocado.
[58:47.480 --> 58:50.840]  It's a great way to kind of see a snapshot of what's in your soil.
[58:51.920 --> 58:56.360]  What I did was I took that same kind of mentality was a shell with something in it.
[58:56.680 --> 59:06.520]  I took a bin on my outdoor bed, filled it with IMO three and rabbit poop, flipped it down on my soil the same way, you know, like a larger version of avocado tech.
[59:06.560 --> 59:16.440]  Now, when I get ready for my outdoor, flip that off, spread that out, put some alfalfa on and plant my plant, be ready for outdoor.
[59:17.640 --> 59:21.480]  And the other cool part of that is composting worms are hermaphrodites.
[59:21.480 --> 59:23.760]  So the goal is to get them to touch each other.
[59:23.760 --> 59:26.280]  And once they touch each other, they want to reproduce.
[59:26.880 --> 59:33.800]  So if you have the avocado there with the fats and everything, it's just a it's a party that everybody wants to come in to attend.
[59:33.800 --> 59:41.240]  And like Marco had mentioned, you will see pretty much everything within that soil systems come over there and kind of take hold.
[59:41.240 --> 59:43.560]  So it is a nice way to see a snapshot.
[59:43.800 --> 59:49.600]  It's another way also to kind of take that life and put it into another soil system.
[59:49.600 --> 59:57.120]  So a lot of advantages from from simple text out there, a lot of different ways to just improve your soil systems overall.
[59:57.840 --> 01:00:04.120]  But again, the first the first goal should just be to have a successful flip and also to cure your cannabis properly.
[01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:07.640]  I see so many beginners, even, you know, in D.C.
[01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:13.280]  and stuff, people are showing off cannabis and it just had a like a hay smell to it.
[01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:17.000]  And, you know, you don't want to you don't want to be impolite.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:29.320]  But if someone wanted that, wanted the truth, you know, in my opinion, you fucked up at the end on that one, you know, and you got to kind of go back to the drawing board because no one's going to want to smoke cannabis that smells like that.
[01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:33.120]  I feel like the majority of people either buy with their eyes or with their nose.
[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:42.760]  And if it smells like that, it's a it's a like a people, you know, push themselves away from it after they've smelled that cannabis, where when it's high end stuff,
[01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:49.000]  the stuff that Marco had at the same plate, you know, people want to kind of burrow their nose in there.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:53.440]  I mean, there's it's just a night and day difference when you do the cure correctly.
[01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:59.360]  Yeah, man, I cure because, you know, all these things we're telling you is growing it, you know, really to grow on it.
[01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:02.080]  That's kind of the low stress.
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:03.560]  It's almost when you cut it.
[01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:06.960]  That's when you can like fuck things up real quick, you know.
[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:12.000]  So to me, that cure, that dry, that slow, dry, slow cure.
[01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:18.680]  You know, those things are very important to keep what we work so hard for, because like I mean, we make all these inputs.
[01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:32.600]  And the reason is because I feel like they unlock a lot of different turf profiles, like all these different things are are adding to the diversity that the, you know, soil gets to eat and consume.
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:41.960]  And then and then now all that will be about all that becomes available for the plant, you know, so that that gives that plant its full expression.
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:44.600]  You know, this natural farm, even having belief on here.
[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:49.120]  Great hearing this from a guy that's grown thousands and thousands and thousands of plants.
[01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:53.520]  You know, he'll tell you straight up, you know, living soil, you're getting more turps.
[01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:54.520]  You know what I mean?
[01:01:54.920 --> 01:02:00.600]  Growing other ways, you're getting a little bit more yield, you know, and it depends on what you're on.
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:07.400]  But what we're on is that up that super that superb quality, you know, that that best of the best.
[01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:13.040]  And the only way to do that is to have everyone those little turps turned on, everyone that you can.
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:24.880]  That was actually like a selling point back in the day, Marco, was like, you know, would you always want to try to hustle three pounds or have somebody that's willing to prepay you for two, two and a half?
[01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:34.920]  You know, there's a drastic difference in your lifestyle when people actually want your bud than you going out there and trying to find, you know, somebody that's not trying to always lowball you on product.
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:46.840]  Exactly. That's why, you know, also, it's a it's a great commodity, man, I know the laws aren't the way they should be on a federal level, but to me, this is a commodity, man.
[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:51.240]  If you have a quality product, that's something you can trade with someone else.
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:52.400]  You can trade it for food.
[01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:54.520]  You can trade it for other goods.
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:57.240]  You can trade it for things that help you on your farm.
[01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:57.880]  You know what I mean?
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:05.680]  So that's why you got to have that quality, man, because people aren't going to want to trade, you know, their good quality if your stuff is half ass.
[01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:16.080]  The farmer market, go to the farmer's market and be able to trade everywhere in the world at a farmer's market, whether it's seeds, cannabis or anything else that you produce.
[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:18.960]  That's that's really where we should be going.
[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:21.040]  But anyway, Jake had a question.
[01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:27.200]  Is FPJ or FFJ with mold film on the top still OK to use?
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:29.120]  Yeah, FF.
[01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:36.400]  Yes. Now, the problem a lot of people have, though, let me let me back up.
[01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:40.120]  I ferment for five days.
[01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:44.040]  I know a lot of people when they hit me up and they have something with mold on it.
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:46.200]  The first thing I say, well, how long did you ferment?
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:49.840]  Two to three weeks, four weeks, whatever, weeks.
[01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:52.560]  I'm like, you know, it's a five day ferment.
[01:03:52.560 --> 01:04:02.520]  So technically, if you're doing the the FFJ or FPJ properly, equal weight sugar, quality sugar to plant.
[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:10.560]  Now, when you go five days and strain that, I don't see any reason you would get mold on that, maybe long term.
[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:13.360]  And then if that's the case, that's not a big deal.
[01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:14.840]  That's not a deal breaker for me.
[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:17.440]  But to me, the key is a five day ferment.
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:18.960]  And that's my thing.
[01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:28.800]  If if someone has gone like three, four weeks, is that material still good or they should discard and try again?
[01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:31.040]  No, I would. That's the thing.
[01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:33.160]  I wouldn't say discard and try it again.
[01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:42.640]  I would say either if I if I had one and I just fermented it too long, then I would probably go to a vinegar with it.
[01:04:42.880 --> 01:05:01.520]  You know, I might just go straight vinegar and, you know, one add water roughly depending on how much you know what you got, but roughly one to ten ish that material to water and add a splash of living vinegar like a Bragg's or something.
[01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:11.240]  Or if you make vinegar, a splash of that and that will vinegar that I probably go vinegar that and then then I would call it a true FPJ or FFJ because it went too long.
[01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:16.320]  It's almost gone into a stage of alcohol, you know, heavy alcohol fermentation.
[01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:18.080]  And so you might as well take it on to vinegar.
[01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:21.600]  OK, I have a question on that.
[01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:25.960]  I have an FPJ.
[01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:27.880]  I take the liquid off.
[01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:29.480]  They say I can turn that into vinegar.
[01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:39.040]  All you do is basically add the same amount of water that you took out from it and then just leave it sit in the dark places.
[01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:40.720]  Am I right or am I wrong on that?
[01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:41.960]  Because I'm not sure.
[01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:44.120]  Yeah, you're 100 percent right.
[01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:47.560]  And I wish I just actually threw it through one out earlier.
[01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:49.080]  But yeah, I can.
[01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:57.960]  If you'd make that FPJ or FFJ, you know, when you strain it off and in the bottom you got that, you know, you have a plant material and sugar all down here.
[01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:07.360]  Then I'll just fill the rest of that with water, add a splash of vinegar and boom, leave it covered for about six weeks.
[01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:13.200]  At six weeks, I'll strain that solids off, cover it again and let it work again.
[01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:15.840]  And in about four more weeks, it'll get really clear.
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.360]  From then on, you can use it.
[01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:19.120]  I just kind of let it sit to get clearer.
[01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:21.520]  OK, you know, you said something there.
[01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:23.760]  You said add a splash of vinegar.
[01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:29.640]  So what what vinegar like do I use like an apple cider with so it has the mother in it?
[01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:30.760]  Yes. Yeah.
[01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:35.240]  Yeah. Get you a raw vinegar with mother Bragg's as one.
[01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:38.600]  And then once you make your first one, then you'll always have your own mother.
[01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:40.720]  You know, you always have a little vinegar then.
[01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:42.280]  So, yeah, just that little splash.
[01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:44.880]  And if you don't have the splash, it will eventually vinegar.
[01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:46.320]  It just takes longer.
[01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:48.520]  OK, thanks. Yeah.
[01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:50.840]  The Bragg's is worth the extra dollar or two.
[01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:52.960]  Oh, yeah.
[01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:54.400]  Quality matters, guys.
[01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:55.520]  Quality matters.
[01:06:55.520 --> 01:06:57.720]  Oh, yeah. If you're going to buy it, buy the good stuff.
[01:06:58.400 --> 01:06:59.320]  You know, definitely.
[01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:04.520]  I was just saying you'll see like a variety of different ciders or vinegars, you know.
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:07.160]  And that one's worth the money.
[01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:09.360]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:13.620]  Burma compost.
[01:07:21.850 --> 01:07:24.170]  Do you have like a picture or a video of those
[01:07:25.290 --> 01:07:28.850]  black fast insects that look like caterpillars?
[01:07:30.410 --> 01:07:32.810]  Like a smaller millipedes
[01:07:33.930 --> 01:07:36.290]  could be soil centipedes. Yeah.
[01:07:39.130 --> 01:07:41.050]  And those are cool.
[01:07:41.530 --> 01:07:45.250]  Yeah, look and see there may be soil centipedes, look them up
[01:07:45.250 --> 01:07:49.730]  and their little predators as well, like actually having them in my soil.
[01:07:50.610 --> 01:07:54.690]  It does seem like when you're doing more of the Burma compost,
[01:07:54.730 --> 01:07:56.770]  that's your style and that's what you're after,
[01:07:56.770 --> 01:07:59.810]  that you're able to get really diverse things coming through.
[01:08:01.690 --> 01:08:03.090]  And I'm going to come through, but
[01:08:04.490 --> 01:08:05.690]  I can't get it to come through.
[01:08:05.690 --> 01:08:09.170]  But there's that area is centipede kind of in the middle.
[01:08:12.850 --> 01:08:15.330]  If that's what he looks like at the soil centipede.
[01:08:18.050 --> 01:08:21.170]  So, yeah, they're they're they're a good little predator.
[01:08:21.170 --> 01:08:22.530]  Sorry, Brian, I cut you off.
[01:08:24.450 --> 01:08:27.010]  I mean, we're freestyling today, right?
[01:08:27.010 --> 01:08:28.770]  Just blowing.
[01:08:28.770 --> 01:08:31.370]  Yeah. So play around with all of this stuff.
[01:08:31.370 --> 01:08:35.330]  I wouldn't think now again, I don't want to misspeak,
[01:08:35.330 --> 01:08:38.530]  but I think centipedes, some of those can actually be pretty dangerous to you
[01:08:38.530 --> 01:08:40.290]  where a millipede can't harm you.
[01:08:40.330 --> 01:08:45.330]  Yeah, I think they yeah, the millipedes are going to be your your shredders
[01:08:45.610 --> 01:08:48.410]  and then the centipedes do have a poison.
[01:08:48.410 --> 01:08:52.370]  But with this, that guy was like, you know, that big.
[01:08:52.370 --> 01:08:56.490]  So, you know, if I smash them on my hand, yeah, I probably bite the hell out of me.
[01:08:56.730 --> 01:08:59.250]  And actually, this last weekend, something bit my knee.
[01:08:59.250 --> 01:09:03.330]  I don't know what it was, but my knee was like had a big ass red.
[01:09:03.330 --> 01:09:05.890]  Well, I thought it might have been a spider or something.
[01:09:05.930 --> 01:09:09.370]  Baby ladybugs look like little tiny alligators.
[01:09:10.210 --> 01:09:12.530]  Yeah, they got a little orange on them, too.
[01:09:12.530 --> 01:09:14.930]  And if you see those, those are amazing.
[01:09:14.930 --> 01:09:15.530]  You want those.
[01:09:15.530 --> 01:09:18.650]  That's actually, in my opinion, better than seeing a ladybug.
[01:09:18.650 --> 01:09:24.210]  Because most of the ladybugs that you get are lazy and just fornicate on the clock.
[01:09:24.970 --> 01:09:29.290]  Yeah, I can't believe people still doing the ladybugs indoors.
[01:09:30.090 --> 01:09:32.450]  The boring gray roly polys.
[01:09:32.450 --> 01:09:36.330]  The boring gray roly polys are horrific for your garden.
[01:09:36.330 --> 01:09:37.210]  Absolutely.
[01:09:37.210 --> 01:09:41.130]  That's why I talk about those as the baloney sandwich of the isopod world.
[01:09:41.970 --> 01:09:47.290]  If you're if you're farming cannabis, you want to focus on isopods that prefer protein.
[01:09:47.810 --> 01:09:51.010]  So you're looking at like dairy cows, Dalmatians, milkbacks.
[01:09:51.890 --> 01:09:56.850]  There's a from what I understand, there's probably a thousand different species of isopods.
[01:09:57.090 --> 01:10:00.250]  I personally have close to 100 different species running.
[01:10:00.370 --> 01:10:04.570]  So there's there's an isopod out there for everybody that wants to achieve things.
[01:10:05.130 --> 01:10:10.970]  But I would never use the grays as thinking that they were beneficial because for whatever reason,
[01:10:11.490 --> 01:10:17.410]  they just seem to prefer to munch on living things a lot more than the ones that are captive bred.
[01:10:18.810 --> 01:10:19.650]  Good point.
[01:10:19.650 --> 01:10:23.370]  I like the grays in my indigenous grays and my shredder bin.
[01:10:24.810 --> 01:10:25.730]  They do a good job.
[01:10:25.730 --> 01:10:26.970]  They tear up some leaves.
[01:10:26.970 --> 01:10:35.770]  They do a good job, they tear up some leaves and once we got here and they're not actually like they actually have some some they're gray, but they have some spots running down their backs.
[01:10:35.770 --> 01:10:36.490]  They're kind of cool.
[01:10:36.490 --> 01:10:37.530]  They're really big, too.
[01:10:38.050 --> 01:10:39.850]  I just need to find out what kind they are.
[01:10:41.970 --> 01:10:52.250]  But yeah, I think this is so perpetual, I think is saying like this is these are the steps, your perpetual, you know, movement.
[01:10:52.610 --> 01:11:03.970]  And I think this is this indoor outdoor because with the chicken manures and stuff, I've seen people have issues indoors where outdoors it seems like there's not an issue with that.
[01:11:04.010 --> 01:11:06.890]  So I just wanted to put that caution out there if you're new to this.
[01:11:07.250 --> 01:11:21.050]  I like I like that perpetual that he's given kind of a progression of of the compost and where it's like going through the animal from the animal to thermophilic thermophilic, then going on down the line from
[01:11:22.050 --> 01:11:23.570]  larger down to smaller.
[01:11:24.130 --> 01:11:24.810]  It's pretty cool.
[01:11:25.610 --> 01:11:41.410]  With the sprouted seed teas, I would I've used like the mung bean if I'm really trying to build up the soil system, you know, sprouting that out and then kind of using that, you can even mash it and then using that as a top feed.
[01:11:42.050 --> 01:11:46.570]  The soil food web goes bananas for the mung bean, especially.
[01:11:47.010 --> 01:11:50.530]  That's a goal. That's a bar right there among being that's a benefit.
[01:11:50.570 --> 01:11:51.930]  I mean, that's a good plant to eat.
[01:11:52.010 --> 01:11:53.570]  Good food for us.
[01:11:53.610 --> 01:11:54.530]  As far as I know, too.
[01:11:55.170 --> 01:11:57.810]  Yeah, there must be something just magical.
[01:11:57.970 --> 01:12:02.370]  Not only is it protein dense, but, you know, there's obviously it's nutrient dense.
[01:12:03.010 --> 01:12:04.050]  And that's just another way.
[01:12:04.610 --> 01:12:12.050]  If you want to go that route, from my experience to put the mung beans, sprouted tea down, let it maybe sit there for a day or two.
[01:12:12.050 --> 01:12:16.850]  And when you notice that things are starting to break down, drizzle a little of that kefir on top.
[01:12:16.850 --> 01:12:20.410]  And it's a nice little like boost in gasoline.
[01:12:20.410 --> 01:12:22.650]  And you'll you'll start to see things really take off.
[01:12:23.970 --> 01:12:25.330]  Good points, good points.
[01:12:27.930 --> 01:12:29.170]  Good points. Yeah, man.
[01:12:30.050 --> 01:12:31.410]  Anyone have success?
[01:12:31.690 --> 01:12:32.730]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:12:32.770 --> 01:12:34.210]  So I made one from.
[01:12:35.090 --> 01:12:45.530]  Yeah, man, because, you know, think about it, any kind of seed sprout or bean sprout or any sprout is always going to have that boost, those growth hormones, you know, that plant, that plant is ready to grow.
[01:12:45.530 --> 01:12:47.810]  You know, the best thing to grow a plant is a plant.
[01:12:47.810 --> 01:12:49.410]  So I believe in them a lot.
[01:12:49.410 --> 01:12:55.530]  The best one I made was that I felt like the word probably not the best is probably a good word.
[01:12:55.530 --> 01:13:01.810]  But one that I made, man, and I really love was acorn sprouted acorn.
[01:13:02.850 --> 01:13:12.250]  SST actually taking the acorns and sprouting them when I picked them up off the forest, they were kind of partially sprouted and then using them.
[01:13:12.610 --> 01:13:19.130]  There's just something about acorns, you know, everything loves to tear up some acorns because it's all meat.
[01:13:19.890 --> 01:13:21.370]  There is something special about that.
[01:13:21.370 --> 01:13:28.010]  Even the top of it, the top of that acorn, the you know, they love the decomposers love to break that stuff down.
[01:13:28.050 --> 01:13:33.010]  So, yeah, I really think, you know, you're really on to something with the acorns.
[01:13:33.010 --> 01:13:39.690]  And I've personally seen that in the woods, like when it's an older area and there's a ton of acorns that have fallen down, gotten smashed over time.
[01:13:39.930 --> 01:13:49.810]  It seems like the fungal aspects and the life when you take the time to, you know, forage and kind of pull things back in the leaves and really dig down deep in there.
[01:13:50.370 --> 01:13:54.410]  Man, is it a huge white mycelium network?
[01:13:54.970 --> 01:14:05.770]  Yeah, you know, that old growth forest and I didn't realize, but a lot of our forests, even the ones we think are old here on the East Coast are not even that old because they were all logged.
[01:14:06.170 --> 01:14:10.130]  Now we had a lot more oaks and a lot more of those hardwoods for us here.
[01:14:10.130 --> 01:14:11.570]  Well, now there's a lot more.
[01:14:11.810 --> 01:14:14.930]  You know how it is in Georgia, especially it's all pines everywhere.
[01:14:15.250 --> 01:14:18.290]  You know, everything's pine because that's kind of how they plant it out.
[01:14:18.290 --> 01:14:23.890]  But yeah, you can't beat that oak, man, just for having that good fungal dominance.
[01:14:25.410 --> 01:14:28.290]  Pines and pollen, man, that's what that's what we had in Georgia.
[01:14:28.730 --> 01:14:31.290]  Oh, yeah. The yellow wave of pollen.
[01:14:31.570 --> 01:14:34.370]  Boy, it should make you sneeze like no other.
[01:14:35.250 --> 01:14:38.250]  There's a question more, I think, for you there from Ross.
[01:14:39.170 --> 01:14:43.850]  OK, have you ever tried evaporating some or most of our evergreen environment?
[01:14:44.250 --> 01:14:47.090]  You know what, man, Ross, I've thought of that.
[01:14:48.090 --> 01:14:52.330]  I haven't done that, but I think that'd be a pretty cool way to kind of concentrate it possibly.
[01:14:52.850 --> 01:15:00.170]  I know that some long term FFJs have actually gotten crystals in the bottom.
[01:15:00.170 --> 01:15:02.290]  It's like the sugar has recrystallized.
[01:15:02.370 --> 01:15:05.850]  It's pretty weird. I had to try to take a picture and show it sometime.
[01:15:05.850 --> 01:15:09.690]  But yeah, I mean, maybe maybe that would be a good option.
[01:15:09.690 --> 01:15:12.170]  But, you know, I don't know.
[01:15:12.170 --> 01:15:14.610]  Try it out, man. You got to experiment with these things.
[01:15:16.770 --> 01:15:21.330]  So I got another silly question to pop off here.
[01:15:22.010 --> 01:15:26.650]  Now I'm cooking up my WCA eggs, my shells.
[01:15:26.850 --> 01:15:30.370]  And I'm just the first time I did it, I did it on a barbecue.
[01:15:30.370 --> 01:15:31.810]  Took me about three hours.
[01:15:31.810 --> 01:15:37.770]  And then I got myself more of a chef style grill for outside.
[01:15:38.130 --> 01:15:40.250]  And that took me like 15, 20 minutes.
[01:15:40.770 --> 01:15:45.730]  Now I'm cooking them just to that that nice golden color.
[01:15:46.290 --> 01:15:50.490]  Should I take it a little bit past that or should I leave it at that gold?
[01:15:50.490 --> 01:15:52.690]  Is that where where the sweet spot is?
[01:15:52.690 --> 01:15:59.250]  And maybe you can explain the chemical reaction of why you're actually cooking them
[01:15:59.450 --> 01:16:03.770]  and not just baking them in an oven if you have a moment of time for that.
[01:16:05.250 --> 01:16:09.410]  Well, you could put them in an oven, like the only the reason you want to do that
[01:16:09.410 --> 01:16:14.090]  cooking process is because you want to remove that membrane that's right behind the egg
[01:16:14.090 --> 01:16:17.890]  shell. And when you cook them, that's able to be blown off.
[01:16:18.370 --> 01:16:23.090]  Because what happens is that with that having that organic in there, that kind of,
[01:16:24.210 --> 01:16:28.730]  you know, the shell is a mineral, you know, I mean, where that film is kind of organic.
[01:16:28.730 --> 01:16:32.370]  So that film can rot or get funky on you.
[01:16:32.370 --> 01:16:33.610]  So that's why you want to remove that.
[01:16:33.610 --> 01:16:37.810]  But to me, the only reason to heat the shells is to make them a little more brittle.
[01:16:38.050 --> 01:16:42.490]  And then that's going to that extra brittle is to me is making them dissolve faster.
[01:16:42.490 --> 01:16:44.410]  I think that's speeding up the process.
[01:16:45.410 --> 01:16:49.890]  Yeah, and I don't remember that ever taking like hours to do that.
[01:16:49.890 --> 01:16:54.090]  Always seem like people were fanning it, burning off the membrane, kind of flipping it
[01:16:54.090 --> 01:16:56.090]  like a chef, moving it through.
[01:16:56.570 --> 01:16:58.250]  And then you were you were done with that.
[01:16:58.250 --> 01:17:01.410]  You could then obviously start on the next batch or or whatever.
[01:17:01.410 --> 01:17:06.890]  But the membrane, correct me if I'm wrong here, Marco, that really the only reason
[01:17:06.890 --> 01:17:10.650]  you're doing that, or at least the main reason you're doing that is so it doesn't stink
[01:17:10.650 --> 01:17:11.330]  down the line.
[01:17:11.370 --> 01:17:12.370]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:17:12.450 --> 01:17:14.690]  And you know what stinks is the bacteria.
[01:17:14.690 --> 01:17:17.490]  So that's kind of yeah, it keeps you from getting a little funky.
[01:17:18.410 --> 01:17:22.770]  Yeah, the only reason I think it took me three hours, Brian, is because I was trying to
[01:17:22.770 --> 01:17:25.050]  get them to that nice golden color.
[01:17:25.370 --> 01:17:31.090]  As I understood it, you're actually breaking down the chemical bonds of the calcium
[01:17:31.650 --> 01:17:35.130]  chain, the molecule itself when you're heating it.
[01:17:35.650 --> 01:17:40.930]  And that's where it makes it a lot easier for the bacteria to get in.
[01:17:40.930 --> 01:17:50.570]  It's easier for the biology in the vinegar to bind to that and remove it from the egg
[01:17:50.570 --> 01:17:55.570]  shell and hold it in the suspended in the water column.
[01:17:55.890 --> 01:17:57.810]  As far as what I had understood.
[01:17:57.850 --> 01:18:02.290]  But I could be definitely wrong because you guys know a lot more or Marco knows a lot
[01:18:02.290 --> 01:18:03.410]  more than I do on this.
[01:18:03.450 --> 01:18:04.050]  That's for sure.
[01:18:04.370 --> 01:18:08.730]  Well, you know, but think about it, though, Ken, it's not it's not just the biology in
[01:18:08.770 --> 01:18:12.810]  there, because if you take egg shells and white vinegar with no biology, you're going to
[01:18:12.810 --> 01:18:20.170]  get that reaction. So it's just the acid and that the two different components that make
[01:18:20.170 --> 01:18:21.290]  that reaction.
[01:18:21.530 --> 01:18:25.850]  But yeah, definitely that breaks them down, makes them easier, probably makes the process
[01:18:25.850 --> 01:18:32.530]  quicker. But now if you roasted them for two hours, did you you know, did you go carbon
[01:18:32.530 --> 01:18:34.130]  positive trying to do that?
[01:18:34.170 --> 01:18:37.970]  You know what I mean? Did you did you go too far with the cooking, trying to just get the
[01:18:37.970 --> 01:18:39.170]  breakdown? So I don't know.
[01:18:39.210 --> 01:18:40.290]  Just something to think about.
[01:18:40.610 --> 01:18:44.770]  Yeah, I'm not sure because I didn't get them to the black, but I got them just to that
[01:18:44.770 --> 01:18:50.610]  nice golden color cooked right without taking them past that.
[01:18:51.130 --> 01:18:56.210]  But yeah, a lot of it was I do it outside because of the smell in the kitchen.
[01:18:56.210 --> 01:19:01.730]  Most people, my wife would like, you know, keep it.
[01:19:02.650 --> 01:19:04.370]  I too.
[01:19:04.890 --> 01:19:08.570]  Yeah. And that's one of those that you want to be a little thorough on, because if you
[01:19:08.730 --> 01:19:11.850]  if you don't burn all that membrane off, you're going to regret it.
[01:19:13.010 --> 01:19:13.930]  It's going to stink.
[01:19:14.650 --> 01:19:15.250]  Stank.
[01:19:15.850 --> 01:19:16.850]  Stanky.
[01:19:18.090 --> 01:19:19.050]  Charred eggs.
[01:19:19.650 --> 01:19:23.490]  Yeah. Yeah, that's a weird four twenty.
[01:19:23.490 --> 01:19:25.610]  Yes, the acid that does that.
[01:19:25.610 --> 01:19:26.770]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:19:27.770 --> 01:19:33.810]  The biology is just a beneficial component to it, using that raw vinegar.
[01:19:35.290 --> 01:19:39.410]  What do you think about adding sugar, K&F sugars to the Bokashi?
[01:19:42.130 --> 01:19:43.850]  I saw a quote. I didn't know.
[01:19:43.890 --> 01:19:51.010]  OK, any benefit to K&F sugar ferment, then Bokashi water added to further ferment.
[01:19:51.850 --> 01:19:56.970]  OK, so you so so you should just make a FPE right off right away.
[01:19:57.610 --> 01:20:02.890]  If you wanted to do that, you might as well just put your fermentation, bacteria
[01:20:02.890 --> 01:20:07.490]  and your sugar and your and your plant right on in the ferment or I mean, your grain
[01:20:07.690 --> 01:20:11.850]  and ferment it right away because you would just be adding an extra step.
[01:20:12.010 --> 01:20:13.370]  The way he wrote that.
[01:20:18.420 --> 01:20:19.940]  For FFJ.
[01:20:22.850 --> 01:20:24.290]  Fermented fruit juice.
[01:20:27.700 --> 01:20:31.620]  So so one is FP plant, FF fruit.
[01:20:31.780 --> 01:20:38.260]  That's all. Now, I do have a question on that, because the first one I made, I was
[01:20:38.420 --> 01:20:47.260]  trying to make the FPJ and I put a sugar cap on it and then I was watching some more
[01:20:47.260 --> 01:20:52.260]  videos and they were saying that if you're putting the sugar cap on it, that should be
[01:20:52.260 --> 01:20:56.460]  used for an FFJ, not an FPJ.
[01:20:57.860 --> 01:21:04.940]  So when I first watched Chris Trump, he was using the bananas, banana flour.
[01:21:05.540 --> 01:21:10.740]  Would that be classed because it's the flour that would be classed as an FFJ, not an
[01:21:10.740 --> 01:21:13.620]  FPJ? Would that not be correct or am I wrong?
[01:21:14.140 --> 01:21:17.460]  Yeah, I call that the fruit because that flour is part of your fruit.
[01:21:19.700 --> 01:21:24.900]  That's what makes the fruit, but I don't do the sugar cap can because to me, that's
[01:21:25.260 --> 01:21:27.580]  it's already so expensive with all the sugars.
[01:21:28.340 --> 01:21:34.260]  To me, the sugar cap is just adding an extra sugar to the sugary situation.
[01:21:34.780 --> 01:21:38.300]  Now, if you're going to make a vinegar, at least you're not going to be wasting that
[01:21:38.300 --> 01:21:42.420]  sugar cap. But to me that I don't do the sugar cap.
[01:21:42.460 --> 01:21:44.540]  A lot of people do swear by it, but I don't.
[01:21:45.180 --> 01:21:48.940]  And that's just on the FPJ or is that on the FFJ as well?
[01:21:49.260 --> 01:21:53.380]  Both, because a lot of times the FFJs are even sweeter.
[01:21:53.500 --> 01:22:00.340]  So what I do is I even use will use less sugar in the FFJ sometimes than one to one.
[01:22:00.340 --> 01:22:04.740]  I'll go a little less because the fruit is so sweet and it seems to work out fine.
[01:22:04.900 --> 01:22:06.340]  But that sugar gets expensive.
[01:22:06.940 --> 01:22:08.580]  Yeah. I'm telling you about it.
[01:22:08.740 --> 01:22:10.500]  I buy about a 50 pound bag.
[01:22:10.820 --> 01:22:13.260]  Yeah, me too. I got this right here is sugar.
[01:22:13.300 --> 01:22:14.220]  This is my sugar.
[01:22:14.780 --> 01:22:19.820]  And I would say in a newer system, like if you're, you know, just even a couple of
[01:22:19.820 --> 01:22:24.860]  months in and you go pretty heavy handed with the FFJs, you're going to cause a lot of
[01:22:24.860 --> 01:22:29.540]  issues. It almost seems like you're going to the fungus gnats, thrips, white flies, a lot
[01:22:29.540 --> 01:22:34.100]  a lot of pests are going to come if you go heavy handed with that stuff.
[01:22:34.460 --> 01:22:39.660]  Just seems like there's almost too much sugar in that soil system for it being new.
[01:22:39.660 --> 01:22:45.980]  So I would, in my opinion, I would kind of stay away from that until everything's running
[01:22:46.580 --> 01:22:51.460]  pretty nicely. And then when you want to kind of level up, level two, level three, that kind
[01:22:51.460 --> 01:22:56.740]  of stuff again, then then I would mess around with with the FFJ, the FPGA, especially from a
[01:22:56.740 --> 01:23:00.780]  cannabis base. As long as you put it in the refrigerator and you're not heavy handed
[01:23:00.780 --> 01:23:05.020]  again, I mean, just don't be heavy handed with anything that from my experience.
[01:23:05.420 --> 01:23:07.540]  I haven't seen that because the sugars aren't there.
[01:23:08.980 --> 01:23:10.340]  Yeah, great points, man.
[01:23:10.340 --> 01:23:12.660]  And that's why I like the way I recommend this.
[01:23:12.660 --> 01:23:16.220]  If you want to go natural farming, you've got to go JLFs.
[01:23:16.380 --> 01:23:20.940]  To me, that's your number one, because first of all, they are not sugar based.
[01:23:21.260 --> 01:23:22.940]  And so you're not going to get that.
[01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:27.100]  The thing is, these the sugar thing, they're fine.
[01:23:27.140 --> 01:23:33.060]  And and I was going to set up and do a demonstration, but I can't get my phone to link.
[01:23:33.060 --> 01:23:35.780]  So I may reset up right here in a minute.
[01:23:35.780 --> 01:23:41.820]  But but my point is the F, the natural farming inputs are very diluted.
[01:23:41.820 --> 01:23:43.380]  So they're like one to one thousand.
[01:23:43.420 --> 01:23:47.980]  So just say, for instance, I make a I'm going to make a solution to water my plants
[01:23:47.980 --> 01:23:52.500]  like a maintenance solution will be OHN, FPGA and a vinegar.
[01:23:52.620 --> 01:23:53.820]  You know, those three things.
[01:23:53.860 --> 01:23:58.460]  Well, if you're doing those at one to one thousand, you have very little nutrient
[01:23:58.460 --> 01:24:00.780]  strength. Like there's not any strength in that.
[01:24:00.780 --> 01:24:01.780]  It's very measurable.
[01:24:01.780 --> 01:24:06.940]  Now, it's it's good for it's got plant growth hormones, enzymes and things like that.
[01:24:07.700 --> 01:24:13.180]  But to me, what's going to make that special now is when I increase the strength of it
[01:24:13.180 --> 01:24:18.580]  with JLF. So now I got that base natural farming maintenance solution.
[01:24:18.580 --> 01:24:24.140]  Now I'm adding JLF to the point I'm strengthening it to match my plant stage of growth.
[01:24:24.500 --> 01:24:29.700]  That's the key, because if you're adding a lot of sugar to a soil, just say, for instance,
[01:24:29.700 --> 01:24:35.500]  you have small pots and you're adding a lot of sugary inputs, the microbiology in there
[01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:40.540]  is not does not have time enough to break that down before you water it again.
[01:24:40.940 --> 01:24:42.860]  Can't break it down. Watering it again.
[01:24:43.100 --> 01:24:45.380]  You end up with a surplus of sugar in your soil.
[01:24:45.380 --> 01:24:48.140]  And what happens is it changes the pH of your soil.
[01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:52.780]  You know what I mean? And that's where your plants look like shit and go go into, you
[01:24:52.780 --> 01:24:57.140]  know, go go looking deficient FPGA.
[01:24:57.860 --> 01:25:04.860]  I mean, JLF, which is Jadam liquid fertilizer, half a container of plant material, fill the
[01:25:04.860 --> 01:25:11.100]  rest of water, add in some leaf mold or soil that right there is readily available
[01:25:11.100 --> 01:25:12.500]  nutrients for your plants.
[01:25:12.500 --> 01:25:15.980]  Like that's where you should be starting out.
[01:25:15.980 --> 01:25:18.260]  JLF, Jadam liquid fertilizer.
[01:25:20.700 --> 01:25:27.020]  Those are bars, man, because too many I would I would store your cannabis FPGA in the
[01:25:27.020 --> 01:25:30.500]  fridge for sure. I've had way more success doing it that way.
[01:25:30.980 --> 01:25:35.580]  Yeah, I store them in the fridge, guys, like, you know, the ones especially like my leafy
[01:25:35.580 --> 01:25:39.100]  ones, comfrey's, nettles and things like that.
[01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:40.820]  I keep all that stuff in the fridge.
[01:25:41.380 --> 01:25:42.460]  They're very active.
[01:25:42.580 --> 01:25:43.860]  They seem to last longer.
[01:25:44.860 --> 01:25:47.660]  And what happens is you get enough shit in that fridge.
[01:25:47.820 --> 01:25:49.300]  Oh, Finland in the house.
[01:25:50.500 --> 01:25:54.780]  Peace. What happens is you get enough shit in your in the fridge at home and your wife's
[01:25:54.780 --> 01:25:56.380]  like, what's all this shit?
[01:25:56.380 --> 01:25:57.620]  You need your own fridge.
[01:25:57.620 --> 01:26:02.500]  So you get put out and then you end up with a little farm fridge and then and that's where
[01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:04.420]  you can start keeping all your everything.
[01:26:04.580 --> 01:26:06.180]  I agree with that.
[01:26:06.420 --> 01:26:09.300]  I agree. I got kicked out of the fridge in the house.
[01:26:09.300 --> 01:26:14.180]  Yeah. She's like, what are all these damn jars back here in the back corner?
[01:26:16.660 --> 01:26:20.180]  Now, would you would you do the same thing with your.
[01:26:22.180 --> 01:26:24.820]  Oh, geez. Oriental herbal nutrient.
[01:26:25.060 --> 01:26:27.460]  Put that throw that in the fridge as well.
[01:26:27.660 --> 01:26:29.780]  No, I keep I keep that out.
[01:26:29.820 --> 01:26:30.860]  Yeah, I keep that out.
[01:26:31.220 --> 01:26:32.500]  Nice. Yeah.
[01:26:32.820 --> 01:26:34.540]  Public public view.
[01:26:34.900 --> 01:26:36.460]  She's got all that alcohol in it.
[01:26:36.460 --> 01:26:41.020]  So no need to, you know, no need to store store in the fridge.
[01:26:41.620 --> 01:26:44.220]  I forget who said it, but when they were talking about O.H.
[01:26:44.220 --> 01:26:47.500]  and they're like, I mean, you can put it in the fridge, but that's kind of like keeping your
[01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:48.580]  ketchup in the fridge.
[01:26:48.900 --> 01:26:53.060]  Yeah. You don't really necessary, but Americans seem to do that.
[01:26:53.260 --> 01:26:56.140]  So I know that the one that
[01:26:57.140 --> 01:26:59.140]  like I keep my labs in the fridge.
[01:27:00.140 --> 01:27:02.340]  Oh, let me get a shot of that, Marco.
[01:27:02.540 --> 01:27:04.340]  Oh, poor, poor, poor.
[01:27:04.900 --> 01:27:08.340]  If I can figure out where it is, that one.
[01:27:12.340 --> 01:27:14.260]  How long did you do this shit?
[01:27:15.940 --> 01:27:19.220]  Just pulling up like basically the equivalent of O.H.
[01:27:19.220 --> 01:27:20.140]  and moonshine.
[01:27:20.140 --> 01:27:20.740]  That's right.
[01:27:20.740 --> 01:27:22.020]  And it's straight from the bottom.
[01:27:23.020 --> 01:27:27.220]  So for a new grower, Marco, somebody that's never
[01:27:28.020 --> 01:27:34.420]  had even heard of KNAP, what's the one thing that a new grower should really start with?
[01:27:35.420 --> 01:27:38.420]  You know, from off the hop that they can do right away.
[01:27:40.020 --> 01:27:42.820]  I think that I think you should get the Jadon book, man.
[01:27:43.420 --> 01:27:44.220]  The orange.
[01:27:45.220 --> 01:27:47.220]  It's this is the green one.
[01:27:47.300 --> 01:27:48.500]  I have my arms on here.
[01:27:49.300 --> 01:27:52.100]  Start with the orange on 100 or just OK.
[01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:57.900]  Like, I mean, OK, literally like I can't recommend it.
[01:27:58.900 --> 01:28:00.100]  This one's a lot better.
[01:28:00.900 --> 01:28:03.500]  Newer version of the kind of the hundred or
[01:28:04.700 --> 01:28:06.100]  and that's that name right there.
[01:28:06.100 --> 01:28:11.500]  You see, you get that orange book, man, because what you're done is they,
[01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:14.500]  you know, those, those are the ones that are the best.
[01:28:14.580 --> 01:28:18.780]  Because what you're done is they, you know, those folks, the show family,
[01:28:18.780 --> 01:28:21.580]  they kind of invented KNAP as we know it.
[01:28:21.580 --> 01:28:24.780]  Right. Well, then they also said, well, shit, that's not perfect.
[01:28:24.780 --> 01:28:28.060]  So and there's a lot of people that can't afford sugar.
[01:28:28.780 --> 01:28:32.580]  So they also came up with Jadon, which is now ultra low cost,
[01:28:32.580 --> 01:28:37.180]  which is basically just using water plants and microbes and most of their stuff.
[01:28:37.780 --> 01:28:40.780]  You know, so I go to Jadon and get right in there.
[01:28:41.260 --> 01:28:43.060]  Take a five gallon bucket.
[01:28:44.060 --> 01:28:46.060]  Literally go in your flower bed.
[01:28:46.660 --> 01:28:50.660]  The flower bed that your wife's been telling you to weed out front.
[01:28:50.860 --> 01:28:53.460]  Go out there. Weed that damn bed.
[01:28:53.660 --> 01:28:56.060]  Fill half of that bucket up with those weeds.
[01:28:56.860 --> 01:28:58.260]  Fill the rest with water.
[01:28:58.260 --> 01:29:02.260]  And because you have all the soil from pulling all that weed and the microbiology
[01:29:02.260 --> 01:29:04.660]  is on it, you don't even have to add anything to it.
[01:29:04.660 --> 01:29:07.060]  So half a bucket of that fill the rest of water.
[01:29:07.660 --> 01:29:08.860]  And in two weeks, you got it.
[01:29:08.940 --> 01:29:10.340]  And in two weeks, you got it.
[01:29:10.340 --> 01:29:11.860]  He got fertilizer, man.
[01:29:11.860 --> 01:29:15.740]  Like I try to make this stuff too easy because it really is.
[01:29:15.740 --> 01:29:17.060]  We love you, brother.
[01:29:17.060 --> 01:29:19.140]  But I think auto flower.
[01:29:19.140 --> 01:29:22.060]  Oh, OK. Has a really good point.
[01:29:22.060 --> 01:29:24.940]  OK. OK, we'll see.
[01:29:24.940 --> 01:29:28.860]  A lot of people say that Jadon for outside can for inside spring.
[01:29:28.860 --> 01:29:31.060]  I didn't see the rest of the question.
[01:29:31.060 --> 01:29:36.260]  OK, spraying FPEs in the house is a good way to have your wife divorce you.
[01:29:36.540 --> 01:29:38.540]  You know, that's a great point out of flower.
[01:29:38.540 --> 01:29:40.820]  Here's my here's my two cents about that.
[01:29:41.740 --> 01:29:44.020]  We don't grow any flowers that don't smell.
[01:29:44.220 --> 01:29:48.220]  OK, and you shouldn't you should have your ventilation and check
[01:29:49.140 --> 01:29:52.820]  in your growth space to the point where if you do get some smell,
[01:29:52.820 --> 01:29:55.140]  it'll just be for that time while you're spraying.
[01:29:55.140 --> 01:29:59.620]  But my ventilation and scrubbing, air scrubbing knocks that stuff down.
[01:30:00.020 --> 01:30:01.940]  And my wife's pretty picky.
[01:30:01.940 --> 01:30:04.420]  So she would definitely tell me.
[01:30:04.420 --> 01:30:08.180]  But, you know, I'm definitely not growing up like in my bedroom, either.
[01:30:08.180 --> 01:30:10.180]  I got I got spaces for that.
[01:30:10.180 --> 01:30:11.980]  So great point.
[01:30:11.980 --> 01:30:14.780]  I'd use I'd use the diamond indoors, though.
[01:30:14.780 --> 01:30:18.620]  I use them both every time I use every single time I use
[01:30:18.980 --> 01:30:22.860]  oh and every water and I use a FPGA or two or three.
[01:30:23.060 --> 01:30:25.460]  And I use a vinegar or two every time.
[01:30:26.180 --> 01:30:29.660]  And then when I put those into my solution, I measure them.
[01:30:29.720 --> 01:30:34.120]  I measure the strength and that strength is usually too low for my plants.
[01:30:34.120 --> 01:30:37.180]  So then I add the left to increase that strength.
[01:30:37.720 --> 01:30:42.660]  OK, but you make it outside and then bring it in and mix.
[01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:43.960]  Yes. Water.
[01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:46.360]  So, yeah, that's the that's the big one.
[01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:49.080]  Marco is don't make it in the house.
[01:30:49.180 --> 01:30:52.460]  Correct. And I have the I have the secret back door that, you know,
[01:30:52.880 --> 01:30:54.820]  I don't even have to go into the living space.
[01:30:54.820 --> 01:30:57.280]  So it's all it's all contained.
[01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:00.960]  Yeah, but it does.
[01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:02.720]  You're all right.
[01:31:02.720 --> 01:31:03.680]  Yeah. Auto flower.
[01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:04.980]  OK, knows it.
[01:31:04.980 --> 01:31:07.020]  You got to embrace that funk with the jail.
[01:31:07.020 --> 01:31:11.260]  That's definitely definitely has a little funk with it.
[01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:15.280]  So what can have has a lot of frost for us?
[01:31:15.280 --> 01:31:17.760]  And that's of course, the water soluble phosphorus.
[01:31:18.260 --> 01:31:20.280]  Yeah, those char those bones.
[01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:24.880]  Rasta Brothers, Swiss charred large mammal bones
[01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:28.560]  and diluted in vinegar for 10 days.
[01:31:29.160 --> 01:31:32.200]  Roughly, you know, bones
[01:31:32.200 --> 01:31:35.840]  and then roughly 10 parts solution to bone.
[01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:41.060]  And then that'll that'll be a nice high phosphorus.
[01:31:41.060 --> 01:31:42.960]  Now, there's other things, though.
[01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:44.500]  You got to look to plants as well.
[01:31:44.500 --> 01:31:50.840]  Like I got some I just bought a bunch of split peas for for farming use.
[01:31:50.860 --> 01:31:53.740]  And I'm going to be doing some things with those because they're high
[01:31:53.740 --> 01:31:55.960]  and like phosphorus.
[01:31:55.960 --> 01:31:58.540]  They got a lot of iron peas are really good.
[01:31:59.660 --> 01:32:02.860]  So I'm going to be doing some things with those, probably ferment.
[01:32:02.860 --> 01:32:06.940]  Some of them probably feed some to my isopods, my shredders.
[01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:09.200]  You see how they do with them.
[01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:11.860]  Maybe add a little ammo, but look to plants, guys.
[01:32:11.860 --> 01:32:14.900]  Like when you guys are curious, look for plants, you know, Google it,
[01:32:14.900 --> 01:32:17.940]  which plants are high in this and then try to find ones that are around you
[01:32:17.940 --> 01:32:19.960]  or grow those plants, you know?
[01:32:21.340 --> 01:32:22.400]  Yeah, there's some to that.
[01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:25.740]  There's an old head that would talk about that peas, potatoes, pot.
[01:32:26.260 --> 01:32:29.300]  Like there was something to that magic little formula there, man.
[01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:33.300]  Yeah, because we already know the potato is a simple starch.
[01:32:33.300 --> 01:32:34.800]  Microbes love that.
[01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:37.360]  And yeah, and I'll grow, man.
[01:32:37.500 --> 01:32:40.000]  I mean, yeah, potatoes, super easy.
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.860]  Like, for instance, we got yeah, peas, too.
[01:32:42.860 --> 01:32:44.840]  We got bagged potatoes.
[01:32:44.840 --> 01:32:46.040]  We didn't cut them up in time.
[01:32:46.040 --> 01:32:47.140]  They all started sprouting.
[01:32:47.140 --> 01:32:49.500]  Well, now I can grow potatoes.
[01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:53.500]  He's the same way.
[01:32:54.300 --> 01:32:55.580]  Natural.
[01:33:00.640 --> 01:33:04.080]  Hmm. Oil, oil and oil.
[01:33:04.380 --> 01:33:07.680]  And then that shot's fired up.
[01:33:07.680 --> 01:33:10.040]  Yeah. Amen.
[01:33:10.040 --> 01:33:11.240]  And it is shots fired.
[01:33:11.240 --> 01:33:12.680]  It is what it is.
[01:33:12.680 --> 01:33:16.080]  You know, I think, you know, maybe.
[01:33:16.540 --> 01:33:17.920]  How did you take that?
[01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:20.020]  I take shit weird to tell me.
[01:33:20.020 --> 01:33:21.420]  Read that question, Brian.
[01:33:21.420 --> 01:33:22.740]  What does he say?
[01:33:24.820 --> 01:33:27.340]  Says natural sun loving plants belong outside,
[01:33:27.340 --> 01:33:30.340]  but natural has become an almost meaningless term
[01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:36.540]  as transgenic sugar and oil are commonly taught as K&F inputs by lazy teachers.
[01:33:38.620 --> 01:33:40.640]  Well, there are some lazy teachers out there
[01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:43.140]  and there's a lot to try to cut corners on this stuff.
[01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:45.780]  Yeah, I didn't put that one up there, guys.
[01:33:45.780 --> 01:33:46.980]  That was the life.
[01:33:46.980 --> 01:33:49.740]  I had to go get rid of some coffee, OK?
[01:33:50.440 --> 01:33:51.480]  Yeah. Yeah.
[01:33:51.480 --> 01:33:53.740]  She's stirring the pot.
[01:33:53.740 --> 01:33:55.280]  Yeah. Always.
[01:33:55.280 --> 01:33:56.620]  There's nothing wrong with that, too.
[01:33:56.620 --> 01:34:00.600]  I think sometimes a platform should maybe address certain things
[01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:04.120]  that is kind of the elephant in the room with some individuals.
[01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:05.820]  It's getting a little watered down.
[01:34:05.820 --> 01:34:07.160]  I will tell you that, man.
[01:34:07.160 --> 01:34:09.720]  It's like you use the term natural on everything.
[01:34:09.720 --> 01:34:10.660]  Everything's natural.
[01:34:10.660 --> 01:34:13.420]  Well, now that we're, you know, natural farm is going to be the new thing.
[01:34:13.420 --> 01:34:17.060]  Well, mainstream is going to start using it before, you know, like so.
[01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:19.120]  Don't I don't know.
[01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:21.160]  I don't put too much weight on words.
[01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:21.860]  You know what I mean?
[01:34:21.860 --> 01:34:23.460]  I'm just living that life, man.
[01:34:23.460 --> 01:34:26.300]  We're living that that building it ourself.
[01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:29.460]  Making it ourself, growing it to make it ourself.
[01:34:29.460 --> 01:34:31.920]  That's that's what it is.
[01:34:31.920 --> 01:34:34.460]  I think that's natural in my sense.
[01:34:34.460 --> 01:34:38.560]  But I get what you're saying that that word just kind of wore out a little bit.
[01:34:39.260 --> 01:34:40.460]  Yeah, I get what he's saying.
[01:34:40.460 --> 01:34:43.860]  And maybe even also on the undertone of that is when people are out there
[01:34:43.860 --> 01:34:46.200]  and they're saying a lot of stuff,
[01:34:46.200 --> 01:34:50.300]  the community after a few weeks, few months, how long it takes.
[01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:53.220]  It seems like they pick up on that behind the scenes.
[01:34:53.220 --> 01:34:55.560]  There's a lot of drama and gossip and stuff.
[01:34:55.560 --> 01:34:59.060]  And so if you're putting out bad information or you're doing people dirty
[01:34:59.660 --> 01:35:02.840]  behind the scenes, I assure you that most of the community is starting
[01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:05.800]  to understand what's going on back there.
[01:35:06.500 --> 01:35:10.660]  So I think in life, man, when you when you're doing people dirty like that
[01:35:10.660 --> 01:35:13.500]  or you're misrepresenting yourself as if you've been
[01:35:15.700 --> 01:35:19.140]  misrepresenting yourself, if you've been like this grand teacher
[01:35:19.140 --> 01:35:21.600]  or something for a long time and charging stuff.
[01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:25.260]  And the reality is that you only maybe even been doing that for a couple of months.
[01:35:25.900 --> 01:35:27.600]  Claiming that you've been doing it for a long time.
[01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:30.900]  That's just what's the best way to say that, man?
[01:35:30.900 --> 01:35:32.900]  You misrepresent yourself, right?
[01:35:32.900 --> 01:35:37.260]  Like, yeah, you're overselling, you're overselling yourself or you're not even
[01:35:37.260 --> 01:35:40.160]  selling because you don't have the you don't have the real knowledge
[01:35:40.160 --> 01:35:42.500]  to be able to sell yourself in the first place.
[01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:45.940]  So you're like, it's you're you're almost like faking it to you.
[01:35:45.940 --> 01:35:48.400]  Make it while you're claiming that you've already made it.
[01:35:49.340 --> 01:35:51.300]  And the K&F community
[01:35:51.540 --> 01:35:56.780]  and in general, I feel like they smell whether you're genuine or not,
[01:35:56.800 --> 01:35:59.140]  you know, and for the most part, the K&F community,
[01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:02.780]  they're all like, oh, man, I'm not sure about this.
[01:36:02.780 --> 01:36:04.080]  And but what do you think about that?
[01:36:04.080 --> 01:36:07.180]  I feel like, you know, most most individuals are pretty humble on that.
[01:36:07.180 --> 01:36:09.580]  Like, hey, I've tried these things. What are your thoughts?
[01:36:09.580 --> 01:36:11.340]  You know, I fucked up this way.
[01:36:11.340 --> 01:36:13.740]  Are there ways that I can improve that?
[01:36:13.740 --> 01:36:17.280]  And then sometimes on the on the flip side of that natural side of things,
[01:36:17.540 --> 01:36:21.240]  people drink that Kool-Aid pretty hard and there's no other way to do things.
[01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:25.520]  Except X, Y, Z. And if you believe any kind of way outside of that, well,
[01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:27.840]  then you're not a purist with this.
[01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:31.020]  And, you know, they don't it's really silly.
[01:36:31.020 --> 01:36:34.740]  I mean, we don't really go deep into it, but I want people to know that
[01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:38.640]  the community still sniffs out bullshit, I think, because for a long time,
[01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:43.120]  people had to smell the bullshit if someone was, you know, a real stoner or not,
[01:36:43.880 --> 01:36:45.740]  especially back in the day when you're trying to find weed
[01:36:45.740 --> 01:36:49.480]  in like a new location, Marco, you know, that was a real skill set, man.
[01:36:50.120 --> 01:36:52.660]  So that's still set is still there for a lot of individuals
[01:36:52.660 --> 01:36:55.180]  and they smell the bullshit with some of those people.
[01:36:55.460 --> 01:36:57.720]  And I want the community to know that.
[01:36:57.720 --> 01:37:00.620]  I know, man, it's you can't fake it.
[01:37:00.620 --> 01:37:04.180]  Like when you put money first, it just shows through and everything.
[01:37:04.220 --> 01:37:08.860]  Like because you when you put money first, you didn't put quality first.
[01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:11.860]  When you put that first, you didn't put education first or whatever.
[01:37:11.860 --> 01:37:16.280]  Should have been the first step, you know, and teaching and basics,
[01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:18.980]  teaching another man how to grow something for cheap.
[01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:21.620]  Like, damn, that should be step one.
[01:37:23.020 --> 01:37:24.480]  Yeah, I'm with you, man.
[01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:28.920]  A lot of people get to say like if you heard me say it first,
[01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:31.720]  well, just because you heard me say it first doesn't mean you got to run around
[01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:34.480]  talking about Marco's the only way to do it, you know, like
[01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:36.720]  and that goes for any name you want to plug in there.
[01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:41.420]  Here's somebody say it first, but then go hear others say it.
[01:37:41.660 --> 01:37:44.860]  And then and then you become your own mind and say,
[01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:47.360]  I like what Marco does with that.
[01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:48.600]  I like what Joey Berger.
[01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:50.000]  I like how he does.
[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:53.200]  Jadam, I like how Chris Trump, he does that.
[01:37:53.560 --> 01:37:57.040]  Now, this is how Marco does it or this is how you know you do it.
[01:37:57.040 --> 01:37:58.960]  So it's just mindset, guys.
[01:37:58.960 --> 01:38:02.260]  It's just taking all that information, putting it in your brain
[01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:04.700]  and then using it to work for you.
[01:38:05.240 --> 01:38:07.600]  Well, yeah, you don't listen to one voice.
[01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:10.900]  You listen to many voices and you pick out the golden nuggets.
[01:38:10.900 --> 01:38:15.160]  Like Brian's always pointing out this golden nugget and that golden nugget.
[01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:18.700]  Take those golden nuggets from everywhere you can find it
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:22.240]  and see which works best for you in your circumstances.
[01:38:22.240 --> 01:38:26.400]  I grow indoors, other people grow outdoors and each circumstance,
[01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:31.300]  whether whether you're in the northern climate or southern climate is different.
[01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:36.100]  And it's going to have different effects when you're using natural farming
[01:38:36.100 --> 01:38:41.060]  techniques, because the biology in your area is different than my area.
[01:38:41.540 --> 01:38:45.460]  But as far as people, you know, pretending to be something they're not
[01:38:46.460 --> 01:38:49.100]  and charging for that, that's B.S.
[01:38:49.100 --> 01:38:51.440]  Like I'm doing a B presentation.
[01:38:52.040 --> 01:38:55.500]  The lady that asked me to do it, I said, OK, you supply me with fuel money
[01:38:55.560 --> 01:38:57.460]  and coffee and I'm there.
[01:38:57.460 --> 01:38:59.900]  I don't I don't need anything else to do this.
[01:39:00.100 --> 01:39:04.400]  I'm going to be teaching them about making labs and all this other stuff as well.
[01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:05.900]  I'm not charging for that.
[01:39:05.900 --> 01:39:09.960]  That's I want people to understand this is how you can do it.
[01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:11.900]  It's this cheap.
[01:39:11.900 --> 01:39:16.800]  You don't have to spend a lot of money and love your plants, love your soil.
[01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:19.240]  And it's all about the biology.
[01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:20.760]  Feed the biology.
[01:39:20.760 --> 01:39:22.360]  Biology feeds the plant.
[01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:24.400]  Plant feeds us the animals.
[01:39:25.340 --> 01:39:26.500]  There's your key.
[01:39:26.500 --> 01:39:31.000]  Win-win. Focus on the biology and you're going to be healthy yourself.
[01:39:31.160 --> 01:39:32.340]  Your plants will be healthy.
[01:39:32.340 --> 01:39:34.200]  Your animals will be healthy.
[01:39:34.200 --> 01:39:36.040]  And there's my rant for the day.
[01:39:36.040 --> 01:39:37.340]  Thank you very much.
[01:39:37.340 --> 01:39:38.320]  And all that.
[01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:41.080]  And I like that everybody's hearing it from different sources.
[01:39:41.080 --> 01:39:42.880]  The same. We're just saying the same thing.
[01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:47.020]  Like, guys, we don't get paid for this right this second.
[01:39:47.020 --> 01:39:48.480]  This is not paying us.
[01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:50.040]  We're not making shit.
[01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:51.620]  I'm just sitting here on my ass.
[01:39:51.620 --> 01:39:55.740]  If you could see, I move around a lot because I'm usually not sitting on my ass.
[01:39:55.740 --> 01:39:57.480]  I can't. This is hard.
[01:39:57.480 --> 01:40:01.640]  I'm doing this because I want you all to know that this stuff works, man.
[01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:05.180]  Because when I had it, when I felt it, I was like, oh, shit, this is nice.
[01:40:05.180 --> 01:40:08.080]  I don't have to buy any more bottles and blah, blah, blah.
[01:40:08.120 --> 01:40:09.460]  It was a great feeling.
[01:40:09.460 --> 01:40:11.560]  And I want you to realize that you can do it.
[01:40:12.720 --> 01:40:13.720]  That's it.
[01:40:14.420 --> 01:40:17.460]  100 percent on don't have to buy the bottle
[01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:21.820]  if you get it right, start with a good soil base.
[01:40:22.380 --> 01:40:26.360]  Use if you want use latent system of the horizontal soil.
[01:40:26.980 --> 01:40:30.260]  Build it the right way the first time and then you don't have to do it
[01:40:30.460 --> 01:40:34.680]  a second time or a third time or have problems with it along the way.
[01:40:36.020 --> 01:40:39.420]  Go bar right there again, you know, build your soil.
[01:40:39.420 --> 01:40:42.880]  Right. And that's how that's what that's all we do.
[01:40:43.220 --> 01:40:45.920]  I build a build out, build my own soil
[01:40:46.620 --> 01:40:49.920]  and I amend it lightly, not too heavily.
[01:40:50.220 --> 01:40:54.120]  But then I just feed my jail left, you know, all the way through.
[01:40:54.120 --> 01:40:55.320]  Like I look at it like this.
[01:40:55.320 --> 01:40:57.720]  I look at it if I build a soil, right.
[01:40:57.720 --> 01:40:59.120]  And I never and I just did.
[01:40:59.120 --> 01:41:00.980]  I'm going to do water only.
[01:41:00.980 --> 01:41:03.960]  Well, everything the plant's taken is all from my soil.
[01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:07.000]  So it's kind of taken that taken, taken, taken.
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:11.460]  Where is the way I do it with adding that jail left constantly?
[01:41:11.460 --> 01:41:14.640]  I'm constantly putting back into that soil so that
[01:41:17.660 --> 01:41:20.600]  I don't know who's which one, but I guess all of us.
[01:41:21.340 --> 01:41:24.760]  So I'm constantly putting back into that soil, you know, so that
[01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:29.460]  so that soil is not zapping all of my inputs in my amendments.
[01:41:29.460 --> 01:41:33.340]  You know, I'm kind of I'm keeping that where now the microbes in my soil
[01:41:33.340 --> 01:41:36.120]  are steadily cycling those amendments I put in.
[01:41:36.420 --> 01:41:39.220]  But now when I'm pouring in those jail left during feedings,
[01:41:39.220 --> 01:41:41.820]  those are plant built plant available nutrients.
[01:41:41.820 --> 01:41:45.820]  So now the plant can kind of suck there and drink that while the cycling
[01:41:45.820 --> 01:41:49.540]  is still continuing, you know, that long term cycling.
[01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:54.020]  Are there thoughts on molasses, I think?
[01:41:55.340 --> 01:41:57.320]  Yeah, I don't I don't like molasses.
[01:41:57.320 --> 01:42:01.140]  Yeah. Back in the day, it was, oh, you need molasses.
[01:42:01.140 --> 01:42:04.140]  And then it was, oh, man, you need unsulfured blackstrap molasses.
[01:42:04.140 --> 01:42:06.420]  This is how you quality teas.
[01:42:06.420 --> 01:42:09.620]  And then when we started to watch more videos and understand things
[01:42:09.620 --> 01:42:14.680]  from mentors, a variety of people, it made sense why compost
[01:42:14.680 --> 01:42:18.080]  teas, when you would let them run long, sometimes people would let them run 70,
[01:42:18.180 --> 01:42:20.320]  72 hours or more.
[01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:23.020]  You would spray that on the plant or there would be issues.
[01:42:23.580 --> 01:42:26.780]  That's because a lot of that was coming from that blackstrap molasses.
[01:42:26.780 --> 01:42:29.720]  People were putting just a dramatic amount in there,
[01:42:29.720 --> 01:42:32.660]  not realizing what they were doing, letting it literally drizzle
[01:42:32.660 --> 01:42:35.020]  for probably like 30 seconds, 45 seconds.
[01:42:35.300 --> 01:42:37.220]  That is a ton of sugar.
[01:42:37.220 --> 01:42:41.100]  And then, of course, the diversity is going down hour by hour
[01:42:41.500 --> 01:42:44.620]  with that kind of stuff, whereas you're just basically brewing something
[01:42:44.620 --> 01:42:46.860]  to cause issues for yourself.
[01:42:46.860 --> 01:42:50.360]  So most individuals that I have seen now have moved away.
[01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:53.000]  Sugars are still important, but there's other ways to do it.
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:56.320]  Then then molasses, the drier molasses.
[01:42:56.320 --> 01:42:58.500]  I still see some people using that.
[01:42:58.540 --> 01:43:02.280]  But the liquid stuff that you can easily purchase at like a grocery store.
[01:43:02.600 --> 01:43:05.800]  I don't really see anybody using that anymore.
[01:43:05.800 --> 01:43:08.880]  Now, I see now mostly if you're going to use a sugar,
[01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:11.800]  I see a lot of people just using the good, unrefined sugars.
[01:43:13.100 --> 01:43:16.500]  And then I've been messing around with just using like rice flour,
[01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:21.780]  different simple starches, which are very good, simple starches.
[01:43:21.780 --> 01:43:26.000]  You know, guys, if you think about it, you know, when you when you grow a micro
[01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.800]  with molasses and a lot of air,
[01:43:29.540 --> 01:43:32.800]  that that that that microbe didn't have to do a lot of work.
[01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:37.800]  You know, that's a that's a very high, high octane sugar source.
[01:43:38.380 --> 01:43:42.140]  Whereas so then so then a weak microbe can grow by it.
[01:43:42.140 --> 01:43:46.200]  Right. That high, super rich environment, like an incubator. Right.
[01:43:46.700 --> 01:43:51.140]  You know, when you have a anything that's born an animal or whatever,
[01:43:51.440 --> 01:43:54.100]  and it doesn't do well, you put it in that incubator. Right.
[01:43:54.140 --> 01:43:57.300]  So what you're doing is you're giving them that that nice condition
[01:43:57.300 --> 01:43:59.800]  to where it can grow so it can grow out.
[01:43:59.800 --> 01:44:03.000]  We don't want our micro our microbes grown in an incubator.
[01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:04.440]  We don't want them baby.
[01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:08.800]  We want the ones that are going to throw in some rice flour or some simple starch
[01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:10.800]  and they grow, they kick ass.
[01:44:10.800 --> 01:44:13.180]  We want the ones that grow, they grow like that.
[01:44:13.180 --> 01:44:16.540]  So that's why I don't care for molasses.
[01:44:16.540 --> 01:44:19.200]  I gave up on that some time ago.
[01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:24.080]  I rather eat molasses myself, to be honest, and I do use it in my garden.
[01:44:24.100 --> 01:44:27.940]  I'll put it on some biscuits or something old school down south stuff.
[01:44:29.580 --> 01:44:31.400]  But grandma's molasses tastes good.
[01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:33.880]  I just don't really use it in my garden for those reasons.
[01:44:35.300 --> 01:44:37.380]  Don't do a lot of bubbling teas.
[01:44:37.380 --> 01:44:39.940]  I do some, you know, my liquid IMOs,
[01:44:41.540 --> 01:44:46.400]  IMO, you know, liquid IMO with the air vortex brewer,
[01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:48.940]  not a bubbler and that kind of thing.
[01:44:50.140 --> 01:44:52.340]  But I'm not a big molasses tea guy.
[01:44:52.680 --> 01:44:56.840]  Some people are great at it, but I think there's a very tiny sweet spot on it.
[01:44:56.840 --> 01:45:00.080]  And you got to be, you know, be on your game
[01:45:00.440 --> 01:45:04.040]  or you really just kind of brew on, you know, something that's
[01:45:04.540 --> 01:45:07.540]  might not hurt your garden, but it definitely might not even help.
[01:45:07.540 --> 01:45:10.440]  You might just waste all your time and ingredients, just putting sugar
[01:45:10.440 --> 01:45:13.880]  and water and sugar and, you know, not really getting any microbes.
[01:45:13.880 --> 01:45:15.340]  And what would Leighton say?
[01:45:15.340 --> 01:45:18.320]  Don't be a what on moron.
[01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:20.120]  Less is more.
[01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:23.620]  Yeah. Play around with like a beet sugar or something than molasses.
[01:45:25.120 --> 01:45:26.920]  Exactly. Yeah.
[01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:30.520]  Try different sugars, guys, like there are different options out there.
[01:45:31.020 --> 01:45:32.120]  You know, sorghum.
[01:45:32.120 --> 01:45:33.320]  I make sugar out of that.
[01:45:33.320 --> 01:45:35.820]  There's different, you know, maple byproducts.
[01:45:35.820 --> 01:45:38.120]  You know, just try different things.
[01:45:38.120 --> 01:45:40.720]  A friend of mine says one of the things they have
[01:45:41.820 --> 01:45:46.320]  a byproduct of the maple syrup process with some leftover
[01:45:46.320 --> 01:45:50.320]  part that really wasn't they didn't eat, but it was, you know, sweet.
[01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:53.120]  I was like, well, that might be a great way to kind of, you know,
[01:45:53.420 --> 01:45:58.220]  add that as a sugar source, something different, just diverse.
[01:45:58.220 --> 01:46:01.620]  But you don't get too heavy on the molasses.
[01:46:03.220 --> 01:46:08.860]  Blue agave.
[01:46:08.860 --> 01:46:10.860]  Huh? I don't know.
[01:46:10.860 --> 01:46:13.060]  You have to try it out, my man.
[01:46:13.060 --> 01:46:15.960]  You see that question there, Marco?
[01:46:15.960 --> 01:46:16.860]  Yeah, Brian.
[01:46:16.860 --> 01:46:18.860]  Brian was actually asking me about that.
[01:46:18.860 --> 01:46:21.760]  Brian, Brian was actually kicking that kombucha knowledge.
[01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:25.260]  And actually, I just saw today I forgot who it was.
[01:46:25.260 --> 01:46:28.060]  Somebody was doing a WCA with kombucha today.
[01:46:28.660 --> 01:46:29.660]  I think it's perfect.
[01:46:29.660 --> 01:46:31.560]  It's all about that reaction.
[01:46:31.560 --> 01:46:34.160]  The bubbles are telling you that it's being dissolved.
[01:46:35.060 --> 01:46:37.660]  And kombucha is a pretty strong acid like vinegar.
[01:46:37.660 --> 01:46:39.360]  So, yeah, I do it.
[01:46:41.060 --> 01:46:44.360]  If you don't believe in the power of kombucha, drink that shit for 90 days
[01:46:44.360 --> 01:46:47.760]  and tell me that your your stomach doesn't feel better.
[01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:50.560]  That's just pretty powerful.
[01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:52.860]  I would do every other day if you really want to get into it.
[01:46:53.260 --> 01:46:53.660]  Don't do it.
[01:46:53.660 --> 01:46:55.160]  Yeah, I do.
[01:46:55.160 --> 01:46:56.960]  Vinegar is to I sip on my vinegar.
[01:46:56.960 --> 01:46:58.260]  Is there a day for you as well?
[01:47:00.660 --> 01:47:03.160]  A lot of people sell cars so much for OH,
[01:47:07.770 --> 01:47:09.070]  just the time.
[01:47:09.070 --> 01:47:09.970]  I don't know.
[01:47:09.970 --> 01:47:11.870]  I mean, it takes time, man.
[01:47:11.870 --> 01:47:18.370]  Like I think most people sell a pint for around 20 bucks of OH.
[01:47:18.370 --> 01:47:20.170]  And I see that's what most of the folks do.
[01:47:20.770 --> 01:47:24.370]  And I think that's pretty fair for what how long it lasts.
[01:47:24.370 --> 01:47:28.670]  Remember, you're going teaspoons, you know, one teaspoon per gallon.
[01:47:29.170 --> 01:47:34.670]  So in a pint, I think there's 68 or I think it's 68 teaspoons.
[01:47:35.370 --> 01:47:40.570]  You can get 68 gallons of OH in out of for 20 bucks, you know, and it's in
[01:47:40.570 --> 01:47:41.270]  solution.
[01:47:41.570 --> 01:47:44.770]  So, I mean, when you break these things down, it may seem like a lot.
[01:47:45.470 --> 01:47:47.470]  And I know I say this myself.
[01:47:47.470 --> 01:47:50.470]  Some things I price high because I want you to make it.
[01:47:50.470 --> 01:47:53.970]  I don't want you to buy, you know, I want you to make the shit.
[01:47:53.970 --> 01:47:56.670]  So I got right to have that supreme.
[01:47:56.670 --> 01:48:03.870]  I am because we just raised the price because, you know, because I because a
[01:48:03.870 --> 01:48:08.270]  lot of stuff you really should make man, you know, get on into it and start
[01:48:08.270 --> 01:48:09.170]  making this stuff.
[01:48:09.770 --> 01:48:13.670]  But when it comes to I OH and like if you really want to just dive into it,
[01:48:13.670 --> 01:48:16.470]  then that's one of those that I would understand why you want to purchase
[01:48:16.470 --> 01:48:20.370]  that when especially if you're just getting into this or realize how long
[01:48:20.570 --> 01:48:21.670]  certain things take.
[01:48:22.970 --> 01:48:27.870]  Yeah, there's there's a there's a reason why a lot of people are able to
[01:48:27.870 --> 01:48:32.170]  sell OH and is because when most when most individuals find out about it that
[01:48:32.170 --> 01:48:35.270]  aren't even necessarily farmers just one is like a health tonic.
[01:48:35.670 --> 01:48:39.270]  They realize the time and effort it takes and I see a lot of the
[01:48:40.070 --> 01:48:44.270]  metaphysical crowd when you see those like Expos and stuff even there that
[01:48:44.270 --> 01:48:49.870]  kind of community is really starting to get into the the OH ends and stuff
[01:48:49.870 --> 01:48:50.170]  man.
[01:48:50.870 --> 01:48:55.470]  Yeah, you know the kombucha OH and yeah, man, everybody's getting on that
[01:48:55.470 --> 01:48:58.770]  natural trying to get on that natural kick man.
[01:48:58.970 --> 01:49:03.170]  I'm just waiting for the first mainstream, you know, company would be
[01:49:03.170 --> 01:49:06.870]  selling some OH and you know, they're you know, they're getting close to the
[01:49:06.870 --> 01:49:09.070]  loss of herbal concoctions out there.
[01:49:09.170 --> 01:49:09.970]  It's coming.
[01:49:11.570 --> 01:49:13.170]  Okay, 94 is in a pint.
[01:49:13.170 --> 01:49:13.570]  Okay.
[01:49:13.870 --> 01:49:14.270]  Thank you.
[01:49:14.270 --> 01:49:15.070]  Major General.
[01:49:15.070 --> 01:49:18.870]  I knew somebody would do the math say one wrong thing and you'll get the
[01:49:18.870 --> 01:49:20.670]  answer chat got you covered.
[01:49:20.770 --> 01:49:21.570]  Thank you, sir.
[01:49:23.070 --> 01:49:28.070]  Anyway, so you my point even more 94 I said 60 60 something.
[01:49:28.070 --> 01:49:28.770]  So there you go.
[01:49:28.770 --> 01:49:29.670]  You got even more.
[01:49:30.070 --> 01:49:30.670]  Thanks for helping.
[01:49:30.670 --> 01:49:37.870]  I don't think $20 for really anything this 2022 is that much money man,
[01:49:38.670 --> 01:49:40.270]  especially for how far it goes.
[01:49:40.970 --> 01:49:42.170]  Yeah, it's not bad.
[01:49:42.170 --> 01:49:44.970]  And the whole thing is you don't have to buy it, you know, you don't have
[01:49:44.970 --> 01:49:45.570]  to buy it.
[01:49:45.770 --> 01:49:49.270]  Yeah, you know, the best thing is to make it yourself because if you make
[01:49:49.270 --> 01:49:53.970]  it like this, this was full but you know, the cost to make is pretty low.
[01:49:53.970 --> 01:49:58.370]  You got the alcohol costs which you know, use that cheap vodka.
[01:49:58.770 --> 01:50:03.570]  This lasts a long time and a gallon of OH in a last year long time and I
[01:50:03.570 --> 01:50:08.070]  recommend your first one go ahead and make the make five gallons or six
[01:50:08.070 --> 01:50:08.670]  gallon.
[01:50:09.970 --> 01:50:12.870]  So you get a gallon, you know, plenty of it and then you're done.
[01:50:12.870 --> 01:50:15.070]  You pretty much have OH in for years.
[01:50:15.070 --> 01:50:19.970]  So Marco then are you setting up a home still buddy so you can send cheap
[01:50:19.970 --> 01:50:21.870]  vodka to everybody, you know?
[01:50:23.170 --> 01:50:30.170]  No, but what I do is I buy the I buy the 80 proof vodka and then I dilute
[01:50:30.170 --> 01:50:30.970]  with water.
[01:50:31.070 --> 01:50:36.670]  So they hit around here to winos and drink the $11 for 80 proof vodka and
[01:50:36.670 --> 01:50:41.170]  I'll take that $11 dollar bottle and I'll double it because I'm bad to
[01:50:41.170 --> 01:50:43.270]  buying distilled water to it.
[01:50:44.270 --> 01:50:47.570]  So that's how you get for that's how you get 40 proof for super cheap.
[01:50:47.570 --> 01:50:50.470]  So yes, I will start cutting bottles and shipping them.
[01:50:53.370 --> 01:50:56.170]  Okay, I'm first and first.
[01:50:57.970 --> 01:50:58.670]  Well, I know up here.
[01:50:58.670 --> 01:51:04.470]  We're actually legally allowed to make a certain amount of beer alcohol or
[01:51:04.470 --> 01:51:09.770]  wine just like you can grow your own tobacco but only to a certain level
[01:51:09.770 --> 01:51:10.370]  right?
[01:51:10.570 --> 01:51:13.970]  But that's what I was thinking is I was just gonna see if I can build
[01:51:13.970 --> 01:51:16.670]  myself a still to start making myself the vodka.
[01:51:16.770 --> 01:51:20.370]  I know because now you're yeah, because I'm already growing most of my
[01:51:20.370 --> 01:51:24.270]  crops to make the OH in so now if you could distill a little vodka man,
[01:51:24.270 --> 01:51:26.170]  I'd be some good stuff there.
[01:51:26.170 --> 01:51:27.070]  What state are you in?
[01:51:27.070 --> 01:51:31.170]  Can I'm actually up in Canada up in Alberta.
[01:51:31.570 --> 01:51:32.270]  Oh nice.
[01:51:32.870 --> 01:51:34.570]  Yeah, so I get it.
[01:51:34.570 --> 01:51:38.970]  I got some advantages up here and then I got some disadvantages like a
[01:51:38.970 --> 01:51:42.470]  lot of white stuff and really cold for most of the year, you know, has
[01:51:42.470 --> 01:51:44.570]  it all have y'all dug out yet?
[01:51:44.570 --> 01:51:45.470]  How's it looking?
[01:51:46.170 --> 01:51:46.570]  Actually?
[01:51:46.570 --> 01:51:49.870]  Yeah, I've got some some stuff coming up in the garden.
[01:51:49.870 --> 01:51:54.970]  We planted some bulbs last fall that are coming up and my garlics coming
[01:51:54.970 --> 01:51:58.770]  up now and yeah, so things are starting to grow.
[01:51:58.770 --> 01:52:04.870]  I actually I built a sprayer last year a six-foot sprayer.
[01:52:04.970 --> 01:52:10.770]  I can drag behind my lawnmower and I was using we had a bad drought and
[01:52:10.770 --> 01:52:18.170]  I was just using the KNF it inputs that I had at the time which was labs
[01:52:18.270 --> 01:52:26.470]  WCA the salt water and then I was taking the worm castings and doing
[01:52:26.470 --> 01:52:30.370]  what Layton suggests to get the humic and folic acid out is dousing
[01:52:30.370 --> 01:52:37.070]  them in water and I was spraying that on my yard during this drought and
[01:52:37.070 --> 01:52:42.070]  my grass actually started coming back and I had people going like you're
[01:52:42.070 --> 01:52:46.970]  not watering and I'm going no, it's it's not be coming off you from in
[01:52:46.970 --> 01:52:47.570]  the morning.
[01:52:47.570 --> 01:52:49.170]  That's drawing it down.
[01:52:49.170 --> 01:52:53.170]  But I had now I have the biology in the soil to be able to do that.
[01:52:53.170 --> 01:52:58.570]  So if this stuff works on a massive scale, yeah, it's cool because it
[01:52:58.570 --> 01:53:03.270]  works on a small scale or large scale, you know, that's what's so good
[01:53:03.270 --> 01:53:05.270]  about it scale up scale down.
[01:53:08.550 --> 01:53:10.150]  Don't use too much sugar.
[01:53:12.450 --> 01:53:14.850]  I have some family members who make moonshine.
[01:53:14.850 --> 01:53:19.390]  I need to get yeah.
[01:53:19.490 --> 01:53:23.290]  Yeah, I got get some for sure moonshine is going to be strong as hell
[01:53:23.790 --> 01:53:26.590]  ask them how to get it get you down to 40 proof.
[01:53:28.390 --> 01:53:29.890]  That's like drinking gasoline.
[01:53:30.190 --> 01:53:31.090]  Yeah, it is.
[01:53:34.470 --> 01:53:36.270]  Like Red Bull Kiefer.
[01:53:36.270 --> 01:53:37.870]  Yeah, there you go.
[01:53:38.470 --> 01:53:38.970]  Shit.
[01:53:38.970 --> 01:53:40.270]  F a JLF.
[01:53:42.370 --> 01:53:46.570]  Wake it right on up rabbit manure all that.
[01:53:50.970 --> 01:53:53.970]  Probably maybe is like a little foiler.
[01:53:54.470 --> 01:53:55.470]  Yeah.
[01:53:55.870 --> 01:53:57.370]  Yeah, that's about it.
[01:53:58.570 --> 01:53:59.170]  Hydro.
[01:53:59.170 --> 01:54:02.170]  Yeah, if you're going to be with hydro, you might as well stay hydro.
[01:54:02.470 --> 01:54:03.370]  Keep running that.
[01:54:04.570 --> 01:54:05.470]  You might make a mess.
[01:54:05.470 --> 01:54:08.870]  You start getting the microbes mixed, you know, that stuff is.
[01:54:09.670 --> 01:54:13.170]  Yeah, I've kind of kind of taking both systems and kind of trying to
[01:54:13.170 --> 01:54:17.970]  mesh them together unless you're really confident on what you're doing,
[01:54:18.970 --> 01:54:21.070]  you know with a DWC system.
[01:54:21.470 --> 01:54:25.270]  Yeah, you don't want to try it because you're never going to know
[01:54:25.270 --> 01:54:31.070]  what's actually affecting what like I do a foliar if I was yarding a
[01:54:31.070 --> 01:54:36.070]  DWC, but I wouldn't try to do anything through the roots themselves
[01:54:36.070 --> 01:54:38.370]  myself, but my personal opinion.
[01:54:38.770 --> 01:54:40.170]  Yeah, I agree with that kid.
[01:54:41.670 --> 01:54:42.570]  Deepwater culture.
[01:54:42.570 --> 01:54:43.770]  That's what he's talking about.
[01:54:43.770 --> 01:54:51.070]  DWC and a lot of people don't like it because it's like wow, man, you
[01:54:51.070 --> 01:54:55.970]  really grew some roots there, you know, those are some awesome roots.
[01:54:55.970 --> 01:54:58.170]  But what about what we were trying to make money with?
[01:54:58.270 --> 01:55:01.170]  I have certain people feel that way.
[01:55:01.170 --> 01:55:04.470]  I'm sure others probably have success with them not but yeah for the
[01:55:04.470 --> 01:55:05.270]  most part.
[01:55:05.770 --> 01:55:08.170]  I haven't seen anybody really have success with that.
[01:55:08.870 --> 01:55:10.870]  Yeah, there's some systems that look pretty cool.
[01:55:10.870 --> 01:55:14.370]  Now they've come some long ways with the automation and stuff which
[01:55:14.370 --> 01:55:15.270]  are pretty cool.
[01:55:16.570 --> 01:55:20.570]  But yeah, one thing I would probably say is maybe like a aquaculture
[01:55:20.770 --> 01:55:27.170]  or aquaponics using kind of a hybrid soil where it kind of draining
[01:55:27.170 --> 01:55:30.670]  through the soil and running to the end and then kind of recirculating.
[01:55:30.970 --> 01:55:33.470]  Now, maybe you can kind of get into some stuff.
[01:55:34.270 --> 01:55:35.970]  I'm actually looking at doing one of those.
[01:55:35.970 --> 01:55:41.470]  Man, that'd be pretty fun kind of a soil slash hydro but outdoor.
[01:55:43.070 --> 01:55:44.870]  Whereabouts are you located Marco?
[01:55:44.870 --> 01:55:48.270]  Are you in a climate where you can do an aquaponic system outside?
[01:55:48.370 --> 01:55:48.770]  Yeah.
[01:55:48.770 --> 01:55:49.170]  Yeah.
[01:55:49.170 --> 01:55:50.970]  Well, I'm in zone 7b.
[01:55:51.670 --> 01:55:54.970]  So we get a good good portion of the year that stays, you know,
[01:55:55.070 --> 01:55:55.970]  reasonable.
[01:55:57.770 --> 01:56:00.270]  Yeah, I'm in Canada.
[01:56:00.270 --> 01:56:02.770]  I did an aquaponics system in my house.
[01:56:03.670 --> 01:56:04.670]  You can't let it freeze.
[01:56:04.670 --> 01:56:07.070]  Obviously, it's going to kill the fish and the plants.
[01:56:08.670 --> 01:56:13.470]  I actually started my first grow my first two plants in my aquaponics
[01:56:13.470 --> 01:56:17.570]  system and had a really really nice plants.
[01:56:17.670 --> 01:56:22.570]  I couldn't finish them in it simply because they got too tall for the
[01:56:22.570 --> 01:56:23.670]  space I had.
[01:56:24.070 --> 01:56:25.470]  I know Layton has mentioned.
[01:56:25.470 --> 01:56:28.470]  There's actually a couple of commercial guys that are growing
[01:56:28.470 --> 01:56:35.070]  cannabis in aquaponics and supposedly having some phenomenal success.
[01:56:35.770 --> 01:56:36.370]  Oh, yeah.
[01:56:36.370 --> 01:56:39.370]  Yeah, there's there's some pretty cool systems where they're kind of
[01:56:39.370 --> 01:56:44.270]  using soil and almost like a combination of a soil horizontal system
[01:56:44.270 --> 01:56:48.170]  because you got kind of below in a in the rock layer where all the
[01:56:48.170 --> 01:56:51.370]  water is kind of running through it and you keep maintain that soil
[01:56:51.370 --> 01:56:52.070]  above man.
[01:56:52.870 --> 01:56:55.970]  What I'm going to be doing in my grow is I want to do.
[01:56:56.570 --> 01:57:01.070]  Yeah, I got the old plastic drums the 55 gallon barrels.
[01:57:01.070 --> 01:57:02.270]  I cut them in half.
[01:57:02.870 --> 01:57:06.270]  I'm going to do the horizontal and then I'm going to see about running
[01:57:06.970 --> 01:57:12.570]  a constant flow of water through but on the beginning of my cycle, I'm
[01:57:12.570 --> 01:57:14.870]  getting into the fourth phase of water in the inner.
[01:57:14.970 --> 01:57:16.370]  Yeah, easy water.
[01:57:16.570 --> 01:57:21.470]  I want to put a fountain at the very beginning so that I can energize
[01:57:21.470 --> 01:57:24.870]  the water before it even gets down into the root system.
[01:57:24.870 --> 01:57:27.970]  I think that's going to be something that's I think personally is
[01:57:27.970 --> 01:57:30.770]  going to be beneficial from that end as well.
[01:57:31.270 --> 01:57:31.570]  Damn.
[01:57:31.570 --> 01:57:32.670]  I like the sound of that.
[01:57:32.670 --> 01:57:38.370]  You got my gears turning because I now I'm thinking faucet draining
[01:57:38.370 --> 01:57:41.570]  down to okay, horizontal rock below.
[01:57:41.670 --> 01:57:45.270]  Now, I'm thinking of making like a little well where it drains down
[01:57:45.270 --> 01:57:49.370]  rocks rocks all the way down and now it goes on down underground.
[01:57:49.470 --> 01:57:54.870]  All right, go with the vortex a vortex system in aquatics.
[01:57:54.870 --> 01:57:56.870]  That's part of it and your swirl filter.
[01:57:56.870 --> 01:58:00.070]  It's called a swirl filter because you're creating the vortex.
[01:58:00.370 --> 01:58:05.070]  If we do that with our water before it hits our plants, you know, we're
[01:58:05.070 --> 01:58:09.370]  creating that vortex that and energizing the water and just like with
[01:58:09.370 --> 01:58:13.770]  your OHN make sure it's going to the right because that's the positive
[01:58:13.770 --> 01:58:14.970]  charge of energy.
[01:58:15.470 --> 01:58:21.270]  I've actually even done my drinking water where I put an old funnel
[01:58:21.370 --> 01:58:25.070]  will actually brand new final but a car funnel for oil and filled it
[01:58:25.070 --> 01:58:29.970]  with marbles and I put the water through the marbles into my drinking
[01:58:29.970 --> 01:58:34.770]  faucet or into my my jar and every time I ran it through you could
[01:58:34.770 --> 01:58:37.670]  actually taste the difference in the water.
[01:58:38.870 --> 01:58:42.270]  Well, there's a lot of talk about structured water and that kind of
[01:58:42.270 --> 01:58:47.170]  stuff and I know with OHN the sheer thinning is one of the main one
[01:58:47.170 --> 01:58:52.470]  of the reasons to to stir the same direction every time it lengthens
[01:58:52.470 --> 01:58:57.470]  the strands of sugars and kind of thins that liquid out over time.
[01:58:58.670 --> 01:58:59.970]  But yeah, I like that man.
[01:58:59.970 --> 01:59:02.670]  I'm actually thinking now that you said that imagine like a little
[01:59:02.670 --> 01:59:06.570]  airlift vortex to be your water delivery.
[01:59:06.570 --> 01:59:07.470]  That'd be cool.
[01:59:08.870 --> 01:59:09.870]  Have you ever heard of?
[01:59:10.770 --> 01:59:11.470]  Oh, geez.
[01:59:11.470 --> 01:59:11.770]  No.
[01:59:14.970 --> 01:59:20.970]  It's a vortex but it's an aeration system where the backside of it
[01:59:20.970 --> 01:59:23.070]  has a negative pressure.
[01:59:23.070 --> 01:59:28.870]  It sucks the water through you can actually put an airline in it and
[01:59:28.870 --> 01:59:34.570]  you can suck extra oxygen into the system so you can super oxygenate
[01:59:34.570 --> 01:59:40.570]  the water and create that extra, you know pressure in the system as
[01:59:40.570 --> 01:59:43.070]  well to push the fluid along.
[01:59:43.870 --> 01:59:44.370]  Interesting.
[01:59:44.370 --> 01:59:48.670]  Yeah, I use that air that one that I build a similar using a compressor
[01:59:48.670 --> 01:59:49.270]  with air.
[01:59:49.770 --> 01:59:53.870]  Yeah, interesting though being able to use different like oxygen things
[01:59:53.870 --> 01:59:54.370]  like that.
[01:59:56.270 --> 02:00:00.870]  Yeah, the one guy I watched I can't find the video again, but he was
[02:00:00.870 --> 02:00:03.970]  actually using that to pressurize his system.
[02:00:04.270 --> 02:00:07.070]  He didn't have a pump pump on his system.
[02:00:07.270 --> 02:00:11.870]  He was drawing the air in and creating a back pressure to force the
[02:00:11.870 --> 02:00:16.270]  water through and that was how he was feeding air into his fish tanks.
[02:00:16.470 --> 02:00:21.170]  He didn't even have an air pump at all, but he said he had to increase
[02:00:21.170 --> 02:00:24.170]  the length of the hose up six feet.
[02:00:24.770 --> 02:00:28.670]  Other than that, he heard it heard the air being sucked into the hose
[02:00:28.870 --> 02:00:30.870]  and and it was he said it was just annoying.
[02:00:30.870 --> 02:00:32.870]  He couldn't sleep because it was outside of his window.
[02:00:33.770 --> 02:00:34.470]  Okay, damn.
[02:00:34.470 --> 02:00:36.370]  I have to see that share that one.
[02:00:36.370 --> 02:00:38.770]  Once you find that send that to me.
[02:00:39.770 --> 02:00:40.570]  I will do.
[02:00:40.970 --> 02:00:41.470]  Yeah.
[02:00:42.070 --> 02:00:42.870]  Yeah, sounds cool.
[02:00:42.870 --> 02:00:46.170]  Because um, yeah similar to the you know, when we're using that air
[02:00:46.170 --> 02:00:49.670]  to push it, but then if you close that system now, like you said, he
[02:00:49.970 --> 02:00:53.070]  probably did make some some noise on it.
[02:00:53.470 --> 02:00:59.370]  So, well, yeah, because you're sucking that air in and it you're creating
[02:00:59.370 --> 02:01:03.970]  a vacuum in the vortex and I can't for the life of me.
[02:01:04.270 --> 02:01:08.970]  I can picture the mechanism is just a you're coming from the large
[02:01:08.970 --> 02:01:12.470]  tube and you're bringing your size down which creates pressure.
[02:01:12.470 --> 02:01:16.670]  That's where you bring in the air and then at the backside, you're
[02:01:16.670 --> 02:01:21.270]  opening it back up and it creates a vortex on the backside and sucks
[02:01:21.270 --> 02:01:27.870]  the air in but it's like I've watched guys instead of using water
[02:01:27.870 --> 02:01:29.670]  pumps for their aquaponics.
[02:01:29.670 --> 02:01:33.870]  They're using air pumps and using air to push the water through.
[02:01:34.370 --> 02:01:38.670]  It's a lot more cost-effective and you can actually repair an air
[02:01:38.670 --> 02:01:43.070]  pump with just a little piece of rubber because that's all it is is
[02:01:43.070 --> 02:01:48.770]  a what a valve and where you can't replace your your turbine on a
[02:01:48.770 --> 02:01:50.070]  water pump itself.
[02:01:50.070 --> 02:01:52.870]  So that's something that's good to know as well guys.
[02:01:53.370 --> 02:01:56.970]  Yeah, and those are gentler on their biology to like as far as when
[02:01:56.970 --> 02:01:58.270]  you make in liquid IMO.
[02:01:58.270 --> 02:02:01.970]  I like that airlift because now that's those fun those threads of
[02:02:01.970 --> 02:02:06.970]  fungi get long or some of the hard harsh bubblers and kind of break
[02:02:06.970 --> 02:02:07.970]  break it all up.
[02:02:09.170 --> 02:02:10.470]  There's information out there.
[02:02:10.470 --> 02:02:12.370]  We made a long long time ago.
[02:02:12.370 --> 02:02:15.570]  We were trying to make the best compost tea thing and you could
[02:02:15.570 --> 02:02:19.270]  make like this vortex brewer for 50 bucks from like a Home Depot
[02:02:19.270 --> 02:02:24.970]  bucket the five gallon plastic water bottles and then PVC pipe and
[02:02:24.970 --> 02:02:27.670]  that there's probably several videos out there which could teach
[02:02:27.670 --> 02:02:28.470]  you how to do that.
[02:02:28.970 --> 02:02:32.970]  So yeah, relatively cheap to try to mess around with like more like
[02:02:32.970 --> 02:02:37.370]  a vortex and then obviously that was explained to us is, you know,
[02:02:37.370 --> 02:02:39.870]  when it's when the water is coming down through the mountains is
[02:02:39.870 --> 02:02:40.470]  splashing.
[02:02:40.470 --> 02:02:41.270]  It's moving around.
[02:02:41.270 --> 02:02:46.270]  It's having energy where everything else in a way is kind of lifeless
[02:02:46.370 --> 02:02:50.670]  and my opinion that's also kind of the way with with RO water and
[02:02:50.670 --> 02:02:53.370]  that and there's obviously pros for that.
[02:02:53.770 --> 02:02:57.870]  But for a living soil system, I like to always have more of like a
[02:02:57.870 --> 02:03:00.870]  mountain mineral type water from my system.
[02:03:01.370 --> 02:03:02.070]  Yeah.
[02:03:02.070 --> 02:03:07.170]  Yeah, and I can't stand RO water, you know, because or even I mean
[02:03:07.170 --> 02:03:07.670]  it's good.
[02:03:07.670 --> 02:03:10.770]  It's got its place but to me like I've read a lot of things like if
[02:03:10.770 --> 02:03:15.670]  you drink distilled if you drink RO like it's it's pulling out nutrients
[02:03:15.670 --> 02:03:16.970]  because there are none in it.
[02:03:16.970 --> 02:03:19.370]  So it's actually pulling things out of you.
[02:03:20.070 --> 02:03:23.170]  So for your body, definitely not and also for my garden man.
[02:03:23.170 --> 02:03:26.470]  I like a good old rain water, you know what I mean?
[02:03:26.470 --> 02:03:28.170]  That's also that's always good.
[02:03:29.770 --> 02:03:33.470]  Spring water obviously for drinking is the best thing you can drink
[02:03:33.470 --> 02:03:36.770]  because spring is going to have those minerals with it as well.
[02:03:38.470 --> 02:03:43.270]  Yeah, there's only two things that I would actually question on that
[02:03:43.770 --> 02:03:49.070]  and I drink RO water and I put actually sea salt into it to get back
[02:03:49.070 --> 02:03:49.970]  the minerals.
[02:03:50.470 --> 02:03:55.570]  Now as for anything that's coming out of the ground as in a spring,
[02:03:56.670 --> 02:03:59.870]  as long as it's underground, it doesn't have any oxygen.
[02:04:00.770 --> 02:04:06.270]  So it's in an anaerobic situation where a living stream that is
[02:04:06.270 --> 02:04:07.870]  bubbling over the surface.
[02:04:08.170 --> 02:04:10.270]  Yes, that is fantastic water.
[02:04:10.570 --> 02:04:13.670]  But if it's from anything like I have a well on my house, I don't
[02:04:13.670 --> 02:04:18.470]  have city water and then it's coming straight out of the ground is
[02:04:18.470 --> 02:04:23.870]  anaerobic. If you can bring it up and bubble it, put it through
[02:04:23.870 --> 02:04:28.070]  something where there's going to be air added in, then it's okay.
[02:04:28.070 --> 02:04:32.570]  But until you've added that air in there's still potential of bad
[02:04:32.570 --> 02:04:35.970]  bacteria and bad biology in that.
[02:04:36.170 --> 02:04:39.970]  So if you're going to be doing spring water, make sure it's a live
[02:04:39.970 --> 02:04:44.970]  act with spring with at least 10 or 12 foot of sand bottom, not rock
[02:04:45.470 --> 02:04:50.370]  because the sand will actually take the poisons and any heavy metals
[02:04:50.670 --> 02:04:54.570]  out of it before you start to drink it at that point.
[02:04:55.470 --> 02:04:58.670]  What water brands have that?
[02:05:01.070 --> 02:05:02.270]  Not sure what you mean.
[02:05:02.570 --> 02:05:07.270]  What water brands offer their water that way that you could purchase
[02:05:07.370 --> 02:05:08.070]  in that way?
[02:05:09.370 --> 02:05:11.070]  I don't know Brian.
[02:05:11.770 --> 02:05:13.970]  I don't know who's doing what.
[02:05:13.970 --> 02:05:18.170]  I know there was a thing back in Canada in Toronto where the one
[02:05:18.170 --> 02:05:23.970]  company was using store water like normal water out of the tap and
[02:05:24.070 --> 02:05:27.970]  selling it as spring water.
[02:05:28.470 --> 02:05:33.770]  Yeah, so the only way that you can trust your water source is for
[02:05:33.770 --> 02:05:36.670]  you to go out and collect that water yourself.
[02:05:37.370 --> 02:05:38.670]  You're in Colorado.
[02:05:38.970 --> 02:05:43.970]  You can go, you know, 20 minutes down the road Brian and you can get
[02:05:43.970 --> 02:05:46.670]  up into the mountains to some active Springs.
[02:05:47.870 --> 02:05:53.270]  You're better off to go up and grab, you know, a toad of water and
[02:05:53.270 --> 02:05:57.770]  bring that home or collect the rainwater and use that. Rainwater
[02:05:57.770 --> 02:05:59.370]  is the best.
[02:05:59.370 --> 02:06:01.070]  It's got biology in it.
[02:06:01.170 --> 02:06:05.670]  It's got the energized molecules from being higher in the atmosphere.
[02:06:06.470 --> 02:06:08.670]  It's obviously the best water.
[02:06:09.270 --> 02:06:13.770]  Spring water is second, but it's got to be something that is a running
[02:06:13.770 --> 02:06:14.170]  water.
[02:06:14.170 --> 02:06:21.670]  So it's breaking up the molecules and fracturing the oxygen and everything
[02:06:21.670 --> 02:06:26.070]  that's that makes it up and then restructuring that H2O back and it's
[02:06:26.070 --> 02:06:29.070]  breaking apart coming back together breaking apart.
[02:06:29.070 --> 02:06:33.270]  That's the energy that's adding that that spice of life.
[02:06:33.270 --> 02:06:35.270]  We can call it to the water.
[02:06:35.670 --> 02:06:40.370]  But yeah, Marco the fourth phase of water with Gerald Polak.
[02:06:41.170 --> 02:06:42.970]  I've been doing some studying on that.
[02:06:42.970 --> 02:06:45.870]  I've chopped it up with a smiley garden on it.
[02:06:46.770 --> 02:06:51.370]  There's a lot of stuff that really relates to KNF and the energy flows
[02:06:51.370 --> 02:06:52.570]  and how things work.
[02:06:53.370 --> 02:06:56.570]  Should really check it out and go deep on that one because I think
[02:06:56.570 --> 02:06:58.170]  there's a lot of correlations there.
[02:06:58.170 --> 02:07:00.770]  We're not or haven't found yet.
[02:07:01.770 --> 02:07:02.370]  Nice.
[02:07:02.370 --> 02:07:03.970]  I just wrote it down.
[02:07:04.370 --> 02:07:05.270]  Check it out, bro.
[02:07:06.270 --> 02:07:06.770]  Thank you.
[02:07:07.870 --> 02:07:08.770]  Oh, you're welcome.
[02:07:08.770 --> 02:07:14.370]  I I'm all about sharing information the more people that can talk about
[02:07:14.370 --> 02:07:17.570]  it and share about it and understand it.
[02:07:17.570 --> 02:07:21.370]  That's our whole community gets better whether you're growing cannabis
[02:07:21.570 --> 02:07:23.270]  or whether you're growing carrots.
[02:07:23.470 --> 02:07:24.570]  I don't care.
[02:07:26.170 --> 02:07:30.270]  I look at cannabis as a scientific method like it's my medicine, of
[02:07:30.270 --> 02:07:35.370]  course, but if I can grow six crops in a year on an indoor.
[02:07:35.570 --> 02:07:40.770]  I can do six different sets of experiments and learn that much more
[02:07:40.770 --> 02:07:45.770]  and that much faster so I can share with everybody what the experience
[02:07:45.770 --> 02:07:50.070]  has been and that's one of the reasons I loved coming here and finding
[02:07:50.070 --> 02:07:54.470]  the Living Soil Conversations because you guys started me on a journey
[02:07:54.470 --> 02:07:56.370]  and I just keep going.
[02:07:56.470 --> 02:07:57.470]  I'm not going to stop.
[02:07:57.470 --> 02:07:57.870]  Sorry.
[02:07:59.370 --> 02:08:00.070]  Me either.
[02:08:00.170 --> 02:08:05.770]  I'm just looking forward to the day when I when we can say man, remember
[02:08:05.770 --> 02:08:10.370]  when we used to have to have a show about that and you know, one day
[02:08:10.370 --> 02:08:14.070]  it'll be so normal where hopefully everybody will just be doing these
[02:08:14.070 --> 02:08:20.070]  practices, you know, and until then I'm just going to keep on keep on
[02:08:20.070 --> 02:08:21.270]  preaching it, I guess.
[02:08:22.670 --> 02:08:27.570]  Well here at least we're partially preaching to the choir, you know,
[02:08:28.170 --> 02:08:28.970]  to me maybe.
[02:08:29.270 --> 02:08:34.070]  So when you were going to make some FPJs or something there Marco,
[02:08:34.070 --> 02:08:35.870]  you were going to try to set that up rather?
[02:08:36.070 --> 02:08:41.970]  Well, I was going to kind of talk about how I feed and do a demonstration,
[02:08:42.470 --> 02:08:46.970]  but my phone, I can't get StreamYard on my phone and then my camera
[02:08:46.970 --> 02:08:50.670]  here is a little short so I would have to set up.
[02:08:50.670 --> 02:08:54.170]  I can go off camera and get set up if y'all want to do that, but mainly
[02:08:54.170 --> 02:08:57.470]  to talking about the strength and that kind of thing.
[02:08:58.170 --> 02:09:00.870]  Let me turn off my camera, see if I can get moved over there.
[02:09:01.570 --> 02:09:01.970]  Sure.
[02:09:04.070 --> 02:09:08.870]  So Brian, you're just such a happy camper today, you know, I haven't
[02:09:08.870 --> 02:09:11.470]  seen you smoking that much and what are you smoking?
[02:09:11.470 --> 02:09:12.470]  If you are brother?
[02:09:13.470 --> 02:09:18.970]  I was smoking on Chem 4, but I want to go actually give me a second.
[02:09:18.970 --> 02:09:21.170]  I want to grab some stuff that Marco gave me.
[02:09:22.070 --> 02:09:24.870]  Might as well dab on that, give this gentleman some air time.
[02:09:25.870 --> 02:09:27.770]  Oh, give me some air time.
[02:09:27.770 --> 02:09:32.070]  Oh, that's almost dangerous, you know, because I go off on all kinds
[02:09:32.070 --> 02:09:39.670]  of different subjects, but if you stay with KNF, let me just pull your mic
[02:09:39.670 --> 02:09:40.870]  Marco, there we go.
[02:09:41.470 --> 02:09:47.570]  Sticking with KNF, I'm going to be trying to set up some classes
[02:09:47.570 --> 02:09:49.170]  here in my local area.
[02:09:50.170 --> 02:09:52.370]  I'm not a registered teacher.
[02:09:52.770 --> 02:09:54.670]  I've never been to a chorus.
[02:09:54.870 --> 02:09:59.370]  If there's somebody in the Edmonton, Alberta area that does know a lot
[02:09:59.370 --> 02:10:02.970]  more, that would be greatly appreciated.
[02:10:02.970 --> 02:10:04.570]  You can hold that up again there, Brian.
[02:10:04.970 --> 02:10:09.170]  Well, I have my backdrop on and his logo is blue.
[02:10:09.770 --> 02:10:11.970]  Well, it's a bootleg extracts.
[02:10:13.470 --> 02:10:15.370]  But anyway, man, Marco gave me this.
[02:10:15.470 --> 02:10:17.270]  I've been waiting to kind of smoke this on the show.
[02:10:18.370 --> 02:10:20.770]  But yeah, I wanted to give that person a shout out because you know,
[02:10:20.770 --> 02:10:25.870]  when you're smoking and you're traveling for the most part, the Puffco
[02:10:25.870 --> 02:10:27.270]  is like the necessary evil.
[02:10:27.270 --> 02:10:31.570]  Like you don't really necessarily get to enjoy the smoke the way that you
[02:10:31.570 --> 02:10:34.970]  probably really want to, but the mobility part is cool.
[02:10:36.270 --> 02:10:39.870]  Every now and then I'll get stuff like bootleg extracts where when I put
[02:10:39.870 --> 02:10:44.570]  it in the Puffco, there's a nice little taste to it.
[02:10:44.570 --> 02:10:47.470]  So again, that's why I kind of want to give him a shout out.
[02:10:47.570 --> 02:10:50.670]  There's obviously a variety of different people out there doing good
[02:10:50.670 --> 02:10:55.770]  stuff, but lately I've now judged it by like kind of, you know, blowing
[02:10:55.770 --> 02:11:00.570]  it out your nose or if or if it's flavorful through the Puffco.
[02:11:04.800 --> 02:11:06.800]  I'm basically a joint guy.
[02:11:06.800 --> 02:11:08.400]  I don't have much.
[02:11:08.400 --> 02:11:10.000]  I just got one little bong.
[02:11:10.500 --> 02:11:15.500]  But so when you're using a Puffco, you've got to do, you know, the
[02:11:15.500 --> 02:11:19.600]  resin or a hash or something like that.
[02:11:19.700 --> 02:11:23.200]  Or is that something you can use with a flower?
[02:11:23.400 --> 02:11:27.400]  I don't think it is, but yeah, it's a it's more of like a concentrated
[02:11:27.400 --> 02:11:27.900]  thing.
[02:11:28.300 --> 02:11:28.600]  Okay.
[02:11:28.600 --> 02:11:32.800]  So are you making your own concentrates Brian or like are you doing the
[02:11:32.800 --> 02:11:33.200]  house?
[02:11:33.800 --> 02:11:36.200]  No, I I've recently moved.
[02:11:36.200 --> 02:11:38.400]  I had to I had to move from my home.
[02:11:38.900 --> 02:11:42.600]  So I'm in a I'm in a rental spot where I'm not allowed, you know, by our
[02:11:42.600 --> 02:11:44.100]  agreement to grow.
[02:11:44.700 --> 02:11:45.400]  Right, right.
[02:11:45.600 --> 02:11:48.400]  And I don't have a yard, which is really weird.
[02:11:48.400 --> 02:11:52.000]  Like everything out here in Denver is more called.
[02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:53.500]  They call it zero scape.
[02:11:53.900 --> 02:11:54.500]  So right.
[02:11:54.500 --> 02:11:57.300]  I feel like it's a cool verbiage word to say.
[02:11:57.300 --> 02:11:58.700]  There's a shit ton of rocks.
[02:11:58.800 --> 02:11:59.600]  No grass.
[02:12:00.900 --> 02:12:04.700]  Can't grow grass here, but we can grow damn nice rocks.
[02:12:04.700 --> 02:12:08.000]  They're like, well, everything is zero scape in this community.
[02:12:09.900 --> 02:12:14.200]  Well, nobody has to spend money to gas for mowing the lawn, you know,
[02:12:14.200 --> 02:12:14.700]  like,
[02:12:16.100 --> 02:12:19.400]  yeah, I mean, it's, you know, my wife and I want to get to the point where
[02:12:19.400 --> 02:12:21.200]  Marco we kind of joke about that.
[02:12:21.200 --> 02:12:24.000]  Like he's his lifestyle.
[02:12:24.400 --> 02:12:25.300]  The way that he is.
[02:12:25.300 --> 02:12:28.400]  I mean, that's kind of where I feel like a lot of people would like to be
[02:12:28.400 --> 02:12:33.300]  in life is to have a piece of property that you own that even an HOA can't
[02:12:33.300 --> 02:12:34.200]  tell you what to do.
[02:12:34.200 --> 02:12:36.300]  I learned that part last time as well.
[02:12:37.200 --> 02:12:40.200]  You know, you want to have a piece of property where no one can tell you
[02:12:40.200 --> 02:12:44.800]  what to do and then you can obviously take your piece of property to the
[02:12:44.800 --> 02:12:47.400]  next level because you're going to be doing these inputs.
[02:12:47.600 --> 02:12:49.900]  Hopefully also passing them on to your children.
[02:12:50.100 --> 02:12:52.800]  So you're going to have a piece of property over, you know, just a few
[02:12:52.800 --> 02:12:57.500]  decades that could really become something extremely valuable for the
[02:12:57.500 --> 02:12:58.000]  family.
[02:12:59.300 --> 02:13:00.600]  Especially the ranch.
[02:13:01.100 --> 02:13:06.000]  Yeah, like I got lucky because like when I bought this place, I was
[02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.300]  still working, had a really good paying job.
[02:13:08.700 --> 02:13:11.200]  We were looking for something where we could have our dog business.
[02:13:11.200 --> 02:13:14.700]  So we bought in an industrial residential area.
[02:13:15.600 --> 02:13:20.000]  It's worked out perfectly for us, but we got three acres really cheap
[02:13:20.700 --> 02:13:26.000]  because we're in the middle, but fuck, you know, wherever and but yeah, it
[02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:26.800]  worked out really good.
[02:13:26.800 --> 02:13:27.900]  Are you ready to go there?
[02:13:27.900 --> 02:13:28.800]  Marco?
[02:13:28.900 --> 02:13:30.600]  Just let me turn your mic back on.
[02:13:30.600 --> 02:13:31.200]  There you go.
[02:13:31.500 --> 02:13:33.600]  Yeah, turn me on the train just came by.
[02:13:33.600 --> 02:13:37.200]  I don't know if y'all could hear that or not, but I'm your mic off.
[02:13:37.600 --> 02:13:38.400]  All right, cool.
[02:13:39.200 --> 02:13:42.500]  But yeah, man, like we talked about, I just wanted to give an example
[02:13:42.500 --> 02:13:45.300]  of just how I would feed, you know what I mean?
[02:13:45.300 --> 02:13:48.800]  So this is rainwater, right?
[02:13:48.800 --> 02:13:51.300]  So this is a truncheon meter.
[02:13:51.300 --> 02:13:56.800]  This measures the strength of solution, nutrient strength.
[02:13:57.900 --> 02:14:02.000]  And you can see there, it's not lighting up because there's nothing
[02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:02.500]  in there.
[02:14:02.700 --> 02:14:04.300]  There's no EC in there.
[02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:06.800]  This one.
[02:14:09.100 --> 02:14:15.100]  This is a JLF that I got from outdoors and you can see.
[02:14:17.400 --> 02:14:24.000]  That does have strength that's at about 1300 ppm.
[02:14:24.300 --> 02:14:26.200]  All right, so that's that's strong.
[02:14:26.200 --> 02:14:30.300]  That probably the most I usually would ever feed my plants would be
[02:14:30.600 --> 02:14:34.900]  around a thousand to twelve hundred if it's, you know, they're really
[02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:36.600]  eating feeding strong.
[02:14:37.400 --> 02:14:41.900]  So the point I wanted to make was so if we if we do a typical maintenance
[02:14:41.900 --> 02:14:44.400]  solution, let me grab my OHN.
[02:14:49.540 --> 02:14:53.740]  All right, when I feed I always start with a typical what I call it just
[02:14:53.740 --> 02:14:54.940]  a maintenance solution.
[02:14:54.940 --> 02:14:56.640]  So that'll be OHN.
[02:14:58.340 --> 02:15:01.140]  And right here I got three liters.
[02:15:02.040 --> 02:15:09.140]  And since we do everything basically four milliliters per liter roughly,
[02:15:09.140 --> 02:15:11.440]  so then that'll be, you know, 12.
[02:15:16.440 --> 02:15:18.440]  So that's 12 of OHN.
[02:15:24.710 --> 02:15:27.010]  Here I got a stinging nettle FPJ.
[02:15:28.710 --> 02:15:29.610]  Same thing.
[02:15:38.180 --> 02:15:41.480]  12, a little heavier than 12, about 14.
[02:15:41.480 --> 02:15:42.180]  That's fine.
[02:15:43.080 --> 02:15:45.580]  And then I'll do a vinegar.
[02:15:47.980 --> 02:15:48.980]  Let's see.
[02:16:05.130 --> 02:16:06.130]  So I'll do a vinegar.
[02:16:06.130 --> 02:16:11.330]  Now, if I'm in veg, I like to do a veg style FPJ.
[02:16:11.330 --> 02:16:15.230]  When I call veg, it'll be like a stinging nettle, a leafy green, comfrey
[02:16:15.630 --> 02:16:17.230]  FPJ, so veg.
[02:16:18.030 --> 02:16:22.730]  Now for my vinegar, I got an old banana vinegar, 2019.
[02:16:23.530 --> 02:16:27.330]  And so the same thing for vinegar.
[02:16:30.460 --> 02:16:31.460]  That smells good.
[02:16:36.160 --> 02:16:37.360]  Okay, smell-o-vision.
[02:16:37.360 --> 02:16:38.860]  We want smell-o-vision.
[02:16:39.060 --> 02:16:41.760]  Yeah, you got to get that smell-o-vision in there.
[02:16:54.580 --> 02:16:55.280]  All right.
[02:16:55.380 --> 02:16:59.280]  So now that's just simple maintenance solution, right?
[02:16:59.280 --> 02:17:03.080]  So we got our OHN, we got a vinegar, and we got an FPJ.
[02:17:03.880 --> 02:17:05.480]  Now we are registering.
[02:17:05.980 --> 02:17:06.880]  Very low.
[02:17:07.480 --> 02:17:08.780]  100 EC.
[02:17:10.280 --> 02:17:12.280]  Technically, that's a maintenance solution.
[02:17:12.280 --> 02:17:16.980]  That's loaded with different plant enzymes, growth hormones, bacteria,
[02:17:17.180 --> 02:17:20.580]  biology, the invigorating properties of OHN.
[02:17:21.580 --> 02:17:24.680]  But the way I feed is I need this to be a strength.
[02:17:24.680 --> 02:17:30.880]  So if I'm going to feed veg, and I got small veg seedlings, you know, small
[02:17:30.980 --> 02:17:39.080]  plants to babies, then I want to be about 250 to 350 on my PPM meter.
[02:17:39.980 --> 02:17:43.580]  The way I'm going to increase that strength is by adding the JLFs.
[02:17:44.780 --> 02:17:49.280]  So let's just say, for the sake of this, let's say we want to be at 500.
[02:17:49.280 --> 02:17:50.280]  I'm in veg now.
[02:17:50.280 --> 02:17:52.680]  I'm going to increase this to 500.
[02:17:52.980 --> 02:17:55.580]  So now I'm going to add my JLFs
[02:17:58.180 --> 02:17:59.180]  to the point.
[02:18:01.280 --> 02:18:05.380]  That I get to that, that dilution I'm looking for.
[02:18:12.290 --> 02:18:14.390]  And you can see it's steadily going up.
[02:18:22.470 --> 02:18:22.770]  All right.
[02:18:22.770 --> 02:18:26.670]  So now I'm at about 500 right there, 450 to 500.
[02:18:27.270 --> 02:18:29.870]  So now this is a proper feed for me.
[02:18:30.170 --> 02:18:33.950]  This was something that I would now feed my plants because I have nutrients in
[02:18:33.970 --> 02:18:38.850]  there from the JLFs, and I have that maintenance solution with the natural
[02:18:38.870 --> 02:18:40.270]  farming inputs.
[02:18:40.270 --> 02:18:44.650]  So that's kind of what I just wanted to show is that's how simple it is to make
[02:18:44.670 --> 02:18:45.570]  a nutrient feed.
[02:18:45.570 --> 02:18:48.970]  Now, if I want that stronger, then I can add more of this JLF.
[02:18:49.670 --> 02:18:51.770]  I got a lot of different JLFs.
[02:18:51.770 --> 02:18:53.370]  I use more than one.
[02:18:53.370 --> 02:18:56.570]  I have some that I consider veg, leafy greens.
[02:18:56.970 --> 02:19:01.750]  I have some that I consider flowering, fruits, flowers, things like that.
[02:19:01.770 --> 02:19:06.250]  And then I have mineral ones that are rock dust and oyster shells and things
[02:19:06.270 --> 02:19:06.770]  like that.
[02:19:06.770 --> 02:19:14.050]  So that's just how I kind of use some old school hydroponic stuff and into
[02:19:14.070 --> 02:19:20.150]  integrating it with natural farming and still being able to dial in with exactly
[02:19:20.170 --> 02:19:20.970]  what I'm doing.
[02:19:21.070 --> 02:19:21.870]  You know what I mean?
[02:19:22.270 --> 02:19:24.070]  So that just gives you an example.
[02:19:24.070 --> 02:19:28.250]  It's really hard to get a high strength of nutrients with natural farming inputs
[02:19:28.270 --> 02:19:29.070]  alone.
[02:19:29.470 --> 02:19:35.070]  And that's why I feel like JLFs for me are the key.
[02:19:39.710 --> 02:19:41.810]  T-Mac wants to know, do you water it in?
[02:19:43.110 --> 02:19:49.510]  Yeah, so T-Mac, you can see behind me, I got a sprayer back there.
[02:19:50.510 --> 02:19:54.710]  I'll hand water usually or depending on if I'm doing a foliar or not.
[02:19:54.710 --> 02:19:59.590]  I may just foliar and water with the sprayer and just hit everything all at
[02:19:59.610 --> 02:20:00.210]  once.
[02:20:04.140 --> 02:20:07.940]  So yeah, man, just some really easy stuff, man.
[02:20:07.940 --> 02:20:08.940]  Not difficult.
[02:20:09.440 --> 02:20:14.440]  And just if you're new to this, dude, that's a gold bar for sure, man.
[02:20:14.940 --> 02:20:19.820]  Yeah, man, I'm telling you, if you're new to this, the tried and true, for me,
[02:20:19.840 --> 02:20:26.820]  the strengths, I match my strength of nutrient with the light and the growth of
[02:20:26.840 --> 02:20:27.340]  the plant.
[02:20:27.340 --> 02:20:32.820]  So two things that I think are key for me is I have a light meter and you can use
[02:20:32.840 --> 02:20:33.740]  your phone now.
[02:20:33.740 --> 02:20:36.140]  So they have an app on the phone which can be a light meter.
[02:20:36.440 --> 02:20:40.720]  And then that trunching stick that I just showed you to take the nutrient
[02:20:40.740 --> 02:20:41.240]  strength.
[02:20:41.540 --> 02:20:48.120]  So when I'm in young veg, I'm 250 to 350 strength of nutrient, strength of
[02:20:48.140 --> 02:20:48.840]  light.
[02:20:49.540 --> 02:20:55.620]  When I'm moving on through veg, 350, I'm pushing all the way up to 700, 750 in
[02:20:55.640 --> 02:20:57.140]  veg, heavy veg.
[02:20:57.840 --> 02:20:59.740]  Nutrient strength and light.
[02:21:00.340 --> 02:21:01.340]  Same with flour.
[02:21:01.340 --> 02:21:05.120]  Now I'm pushing to a thousand, the first part of flour, then I'm dropping back
[02:21:05.120 --> 02:21:10.400]  down a little bit of intensity towards a little bit later and flour just
[02:21:10.420 --> 02:21:11.820]  depending on what's going on.
[02:21:11.920 --> 02:21:14.420]  But for me, man, that's tried and true.
[02:21:14.420 --> 02:21:20.900]  That's the, it's a, it's valid and it works and I've run many runs using the
[02:21:20.920 --> 02:21:24.520]  same way and I think the results speak for themselves.
[02:21:26.720 --> 02:21:33.100]  And I think Brian had something that he really wanted to smoke and see the
[02:21:33.200 --> 02:21:35.700]  results of what you're making there.
[02:21:36.100 --> 02:21:38.800]  Weren't you just about ready to puff on that Brian?
[02:21:39.600 --> 02:21:40.900]  The stuff Marco sent you?
[02:21:41.600 --> 02:21:43.000]  I think that was our buddy.
[02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:43.600]  Our buddy.
[02:21:44.100 --> 02:21:47.500]  I hit it when he was when he was talking about his stuff.
[02:21:47.500 --> 02:21:50.400]  But yeah, shout out to bootleg extracts.
[02:21:51.500 --> 02:21:53.000]  His stuff stands out man.
[02:21:53.800 --> 02:21:57.280]  A lot of individuals have obviously like kind of given the stuff over the years,
[02:21:57.300 --> 02:22:01.780]  but I don't know if you heard me Marco when when I can taste it in the puff go,
[02:22:02.080 --> 02:22:03.980]  you know that there's something special to it.
[02:22:04.680 --> 02:22:05.780]  Yeah, exactly man.
[02:22:05.780 --> 02:22:08.480]  And that stuff he had to look to right?
[02:22:08.580 --> 02:22:10.680]  Look, the smell everything is right there.
[02:22:12.680 --> 02:22:13.680]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:22:16.080 --> 02:22:19.680]  That's what I'm that's my next step was doing, you know, my own extracts.
[02:22:19.680 --> 02:22:20.780]  I think that's the next.
[02:22:24.010 --> 02:22:28.490]  Yeah, that's why I was saying and I feel like old man when I say it now, but the
[02:22:28.510 --> 02:22:32.790]  people that are in their early 20s to understand how to do this from A to Z
[02:22:32.790 --> 02:22:33.290]  already.
[02:22:33.590 --> 02:22:38.770]  God, do they have such an advantage already in life just to be able to take
[02:22:38.790 --> 02:22:41.490]  flower and make it into a variety of different things?
[02:22:43.890 --> 02:22:44.790]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:22:44.790 --> 02:22:45.590]  Exactly.
[02:22:45.890 --> 02:22:51.190]  And Corey, I have to second that Marco did just drop a whole vault on us.
[02:22:51.190 --> 02:22:51.990]  Thank you, Marco.
[02:22:51.990 --> 02:22:53.290]  That was brilliant, buddy.
[02:22:53.690 --> 02:22:54.390]  Thank you, man.
[02:22:54.390 --> 02:22:56.890]  And that and the guys that's that shit works.
[02:22:57.190 --> 02:23:01.490]  I mean, it's tried and true, you know, it's a good way to jump in there.
[02:23:01.490 --> 02:23:02.670]  It's a great way to start.
[02:23:02.690 --> 02:23:05.370]  And if you think about them, once you get in, then you can play with it.
[02:23:05.390 --> 02:23:10.270]  Like some plants are heavy feeders, like some plants, you really got to pump
[02:23:10.290 --> 02:23:11.790]  them, pump that jail up to them.
[02:23:11.790 --> 02:23:13.190]  Some of them are light feeders.
[02:23:13.390 --> 02:23:16.870]  You back off, you know, and other thing that a lot of people don't realize is
[02:23:16.890 --> 02:23:22.570]  that even though you're doing our organics, quote unquote, towards the end
[02:23:22.590 --> 02:23:25.290]  of flower, you really want to back off the nutrients.
[02:23:25.490 --> 02:23:27.990]  You want to not like towards the end of flower.
[02:23:27.990 --> 02:23:28.590]  I'm no more.
[02:23:28.590 --> 02:23:29.890]  No more jail left.
[02:23:29.990 --> 02:23:34.890]  Like after about week five ish six, the most I'm done.
[02:23:34.990 --> 02:23:41.070]  No more food, no more additional feeding for me because what happens is too much
[02:23:41.090 --> 02:23:44.490]  organic fertilizer can decrease your turps.
[02:23:44.590 --> 02:23:46.470]  You know, there's studies that show that.
[02:23:46.490 --> 02:23:50.670]  So what I'm all about is towards the end is about stressing.
[02:23:50.690 --> 02:23:52.990]  Now we've gone this far.
[02:23:53.190 --> 02:23:56.390]  We've looked wonderful to this far and then towards the end.
[02:23:56.690 --> 02:24:03.570]  I like to put on a stress, whether it be periods with a little less water and
[02:24:03.590 --> 02:24:08.170]  even changing up the light, you know, going to some all blues and things like
[02:24:08.190 --> 02:24:09.290]  that towards the end.
[02:24:10.990 --> 02:24:15.090]  I do those things and they seem to work out pretty well, especially the stress.
[02:24:15.090 --> 02:24:15.790]  There's to me.
[02:24:15.790 --> 02:24:20.370]  That's how you get your turps is when you when you start stressing them out at
[02:24:20.390 --> 02:24:26.190]  the end, they have nothing else to do but produce more turps, more trichomes.
[02:24:26.190 --> 02:24:27.890]  That's the only response they have.
[02:24:27.890 --> 02:24:29.090]  They can't run away.
[02:24:29.290 --> 02:24:34.170]  They can't just, you know, so the plants response is going to be to just build
[02:24:34.190 --> 02:24:37.990]  more of what it's already building us your turps, you know, and that's to me.
[02:24:37.990 --> 02:24:40.490]  That's what makes a difference at the end.
[02:24:42.590 --> 02:24:43.890]  Right on that.
[02:24:43.890 --> 02:24:44.990]  That's just perfect.
[02:24:44.990 --> 02:24:49.270]  Because, you know, everybody's really especially when you're new and you're
[02:24:49.290 --> 02:24:51.390]  getting close to that and you're going, okay.
[02:24:51.390 --> 02:24:55.490]  Well, well, should I add more, you know, because I want to feed my plant.
[02:24:55.490 --> 02:25:00.890]  I love my plant so much and then it's like, oh, geez, what did I do?
[02:25:02.590 --> 02:25:04.490]  Yeah, that's true, man.
[02:25:04.790 --> 02:25:08.190]  You know, a lot and a lot of these inputs are very strong like FAA, man.
[02:25:08.190 --> 02:25:11.670]  If you use FAA during flowering, you could actually stretch your buzz and
[02:25:11.690 --> 02:25:18.070]  get some ugly, you know, yeah, that you don't really want any nitrogen when
[02:25:18.090 --> 02:25:21.290]  you're when you're moving towards things like that are actually adding anything.
[02:25:21.590 --> 02:25:22.490]  Exactly.
[02:25:23.190 --> 02:25:23.990]  Exactly.
[02:25:25.590 --> 02:25:30.770]  And I can I can say Marco, I mean, your stuff is loud, you know, when you crack
[02:25:30.790 --> 02:25:33.890]  the jar, do people I mean, it turns heads.
[02:25:34.590 --> 02:25:38.090]  So what he's telling you folks is also certified.
[02:25:38.090 --> 02:25:43.370]  I mean, there's just a variety of colors that he had and maybe we could talk to
[02:25:43.390 --> 02:25:46.870]  Chad when he comes back or somebody that's really it savvy Marco where we
[02:25:46.890 --> 02:25:50.970]  could kind of show that with the right with the proper lighting and everything
[02:25:51.070 --> 02:25:55.670]  because, you know, not everybody has seen cannabis like that.
[02:25:55.970 --> 02:26:00.250]  And obviously we learned that even more in DC, you know, there's certain
[02:26:00.270 --> 02:26:05.470]  skill sets for the for the masses in each state as they probably come on and
[02:26:07.270 --> 02:26:10.750]  exactly these people are still put, you know, folding it up old school style
[02:26:10.770 --> 02:26:16.050]  with the with the sandwich bag, rolling it up, even licking it, put it in your
[02:26:16.070 --> 02:26:16.770]  pocket.
[02:26:17.270 --> 02:26:20.670]  I was surprised the multiple bags in the bag.
[02:26:20.770 --> 02:26:25.070]  Yeah, but hey, that's still, you know, that was the way that was passed down.
[02:26:25.070 --> 02:26:28.950]  So it's kind of funny to see but now obviously, you know, you have good
[02:26:28.970 --> 02:26:29.470]  cannabis.
[02:26:29.470 --> 02:26:33.970]  You want to keep that in glass, try to keep it in a dark, dark glass.
[02:26:33.970 --> 02:26:39.850]  If you can buy a like purple blue ball jars that would always help us sell the
[02:26:39.870 --> 02:26:45.050]  cannabis on just on another level because we would try to sell the sell it to the
[02:26:45.070 --> 02:26:48.750]  individuals is like, hey, we're going out of our way to may tag this milk, make
[02:26:48.850 --> 02:26:50.950]  sure that it's got this protective covering.
[02:26:51.650 --> 02:26:54.730]  So just any way that you can make your product look a little bit more
[02:26:54.750 --> 02:26:55.750]  luxurious.
[02:26:56.350 --> 02:26:59.130]  It's always kind of been beneficial, especially when it comes down to
[02:26:59.150 --> 02:26:59.850]  cannabis.
[02:26:59.850 --> 02:27:05.430]  So if it smells right and looks right, people aren't really going to try to
[02:27:05.450 --> 02:27:07.050]  negotiate on price anymore.
[02:27:07.550 --> 02:27:11.530]  No, I know I thought about the dark color jar, but I was like, well, people
[02:27:11.550 --> 02:27:15.730]  think you're trying to hide something then but what it does, it does keep, you
[02:27:15.830 --> 02:27:17.030]  know, block the light out.
[02:27:17.030 --> 02:27:20.510]  You're keeping that, you know, everything, you know, nice and dark makes
[02:27:20.530 --> 02:27:21.030]  sense.
[02:27:21.630 --> 02:27:25.210]  Or you can paper mache your glass jars to that was something else that we, you
[02:27:25.230 --> 02:27:27.730]  know, try to keep it out there brand yourself.
[02:27:27.930 --> 02:27:28.530]  Oh, yeah.
[02:27:28.530 --> 02:27:33.710]  Yeah, but there's a lot of ways to keep that dark and it obviously needs to be
[02:27:33.730 --> 02:27:35.030]  in a cool dark place.
[02:27:35.630 --> 02:27:36.430]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:27:36.430 --> 02:27:39.430]  Definitely cool and dark glass for sure.
[02:27:39.430 --> 02:27:44.510]  It was funny though to see all the sandwich baggies still, you know, should
[02:27:44.530 --> 02:27:44.930]  I do?
[02:27:45.030 --> 02:27:45.730]  Can you check?
[02:27:46.430 --> 02:27:50.730]  So yeah, you were just talking about EC when you're doing your testing.
[02:27:51.530 --> 02:27:55.830]  Maybe just touch on that a little bit more and if you can actually stack it.
[02:27:56.930 --> 02:27:59.530]  Yeah, so can you stack EC in a living?
[02:27:59.730 --> 02:28:03.630]  Okay, so you're saying like keep just build in nutrients into it.
[02:28:05.430 --> 02:28:09.710]  Yeah to an extent and that's that's pretty much what you know, what we do
[02:28:09.730 --> 02:28:14.810]  like why we why go get acorns and make IMO, you know, because that is the that
[02:28:14.810 --> 02:28:18.490]  is that nutrient that I'm, you know, it's all nutrition that I'm stacking in
[02:28:18.510 --> 02:28:23.810]  there, you know, you know, you're trying to probably do.
[02:28:24.910 --> 02:28:26.310]  I mean, I front load my soil.
[02:28:26.310 --> 02:28:27.910]  So I think you can do that.
[02:28:28.810 --> 02:28:30.910]  There's some mixes that can go water only.
[02:28:30.910 --> 02:28:33.710]  I know Big Worm does water only with his mix.
[02:28:34.210 --> 02:28:36.610]  So there's lots of different options out there, man.
[02:28:44.890 --> 02:28:46.590]  Yeah, man, you can't beat the horizontal.
[02:28:46.590 --> 02:28:51.170]  I've actually adapted Layton's horizontal to myself because I like it
[02:28:51.170 --> 02:28:51.970]  so much.
[02:28:53.070 --> 02:28:57.350]  Wonderful, especially when you start while crafting some sand silt and things
[02:28:57.370 --> 02:28:59.570]  from the local good rivers and stuff.
[02:28:59.570 --> 02:29:00.670]  It gets really nice.
[02:29:01.470 --> 02:29:03.970]  I remember with the first time that I saw it.
[02:29:04.170 --> 02:29:04.870]  I went.
[02:29:04.870 --> 02:29:05.670]  Oh, yeah, right.
[02:29:05.670 --> 02:29:10.150]  Like this is nuts and then I didn't I didn't see it again for probably, you
[02:29:10.170 --> 02:29:15.150]  know, a few months and then I started watching the living soil conversations
[02:29:15.170 --> 02:29:17.970]  and saw Layton say talking about it again.
[02:29:17.970 --> 02:29:22.270]  And then all of a sudden it went, oh, you idiot.
[02:29:22.270 --> 02:29:24.470]  Of course, it makes so much sense.
[02:29:24.670 --> 02:29:29.670]  Yeah, but yeah, like some of us we did we look what we don't see.
[02:29:29.670 --> 02:29:35.550]  It's like the guys moving from your old HPS to the LEDs, you know, after they
[02:29:35.570 --> 02:29:37.670]  they've moved and they're seeing what's happening.
[02:29:37.670 --> 02:29:39.870]  They're going why didn't I do this before?
[02:29:39.870 --> 02:29:41.570]  Why was I such an idiot?
[02:29:41.870 --> 02:29:44.970]  Yeah, but until you've done it, you know, it's scary.
[02:29:44.970 --> 02:29:50.750]  It's scary to move from, you know, a DWC or deep water culture or a hydroponic
[02:29:50.770 --> 02:29:52.670]  system into living soil.
[02:29:52.670 --> 02:29:53.570]  That's your life.
[02:29:53.570 --> 02:29:54.570]  That's your medicine.
[02:29:54.570 --> 02:29:55.770]  That's your livelihood.
[02:29:56.470 --> 02:29:57.870]  You don't want to screw up.
[02:29:57.870 --> 02:30:01.070]  That's why I tell people start with one pot.
[02:30:01.070 --> 02:30:02.670]  Just do a 30 gallon.
[02:30:03.170 --> 02:30:04.070]  Try it.
[02:30:04.170 --> 02:30:06.470]  Test test and test.
[02:30:07.570 --> 02:30:08.870]  I say the same thing, man.
[02:30:08.870 --> 02:30:14.550]  I'm like, even if you run hydros set up a little side grow with just try this
[02:30:14.650 --> 02:30:15.850]  living soil, man.
[02:30:16.150 --> 02:30:20.330]  Yeah, start a worm bin with that 30 gallon because then you can obviously turn that
[02:30:20.350 --> 02:30:20.850]  into something.
[02:30:20.850 --> 02:30:22.350]  So it's really easy to manage.
[02:30:22.650 --> 02:30:27.630]  And then once you start to see that life take hold, most individuals, I think, start
[02:30:27.650 --> 02:30:31.150]  to see why this is going to be beneficial for them as a farmer.
[02:30:31.750 --> 02:30:34.750]  Just less labor in general would peak.
[02:30:34.750 --> 02:30:40.630]  I think most people's interest, you know, yeah, that is one thing that always hit me
[02:30:40.650 --> 02:30:43.130]  when I was younger when people talk about, hey, you know, the one thing that
[02:30:43.230 --> 02:30:48.130]  everybody has in common is we all have the same amount of hours per day.
[02:30:49.030 --> 02:30:51.630]  Everybody else, you know, there's two other variables through that.
[02:30:51.630 --> 02:30:55.330]  But the time is precious and natural farming.
[02:30:55.330 --> 02:30:58.810]  You put a lot of time in learning these inputs and stuff amendments at the
[02:30:58.830 --> 02:31:03.710]  beginning, but then it minimizes everything that you're doing and obviously is
[02:31:03.730 --> 02:31:04.430]  saving money.
[02:31:04.430 --> 02:31:10.910]  But also the time aspect to me, especially getting older, is more valuable,
[02:31:10.910 --> 02:31:14.010]  honestly, than a lot of the monetary things.
[02:31:14.710 --> 02:31:15.210]  Yeah.
[02:31:15.510 --> 02:31:16.610]  Yeah, an earth box, man.
[02:31:16.610 --> 02:31:20.410]  That's some old, like that was like 707 bags or earth boxes.
[02:31:20.410 --> 02:31:24.410]  That's what people would kind of run, depending on, I guess, their budget.
[02:31:25.210 --> 02:31:30.290]  Well, yeah, and I found that from Kevin Jodry when he was bringing some old mums
[02:31:30.310 --> 02:31:34.490]  that guys had for years in their closet kind of thing.
[02:31:34.510 --> 02:31:37.890]  And, you know, they're not really healthy and he put them in the earth box and was
[02:31:37.910 --> 02:31:39.810]  using the EM1 with them.
[02:31:40.310 --> 02:31:45.310]  And he was able to bring them back, you know, into vibrant and healthy.
[02:31:46.810 --> 02:31:52.110]  You know, it's but here's squishy is it has a damn good point.
[02:31:52.710 --> 02:31:57.390]  Yeah, all the cannabis community is going to change the agricultural world by
[02:31:57.410 --> 02:31:59.510]  bringing this knowledge to the people.
[02:31:59.810 --> 02:32:01.490]  And that's what I'm all about, brother.
[02:32:01.510 --> 02:32:02.710]  And that's why Brian's here.
[02:32:02.710 --> 02:32:08.010]  That's why Marcos here, Leighton, Chad, London, the list goes on.
[02:32:08.310 --> 02:32:13.010]  We want this information to get out the more people that are caring and sharing.
[02:32:13.310 --> 02:32:16.790]  That's why, you know, hit the like button guys, you know, make sure you're
[02:32:16.810 --> 02:32:21.010]  subscribed to the channel, you know, throw it out on your social media.
[02:32:21.310 --> 02:32:22.910]  Get this information out.
[02:32:22.910 --> 02:32:25.710]  It, you know, we're all benefiting from it.
[02:32:25.910 --> 02:32:31.490]  Let's move it into the the farmers hands and get them growing food that is good
[02:32:31.510 --> 02:32:32.510]  for us to eat.
[02:32:34.410 --> 02:32:35.510]  Well said, sir.
[02:32:35.910 --> 02:32:39.290]  Yeah, that's why again, shout out to the to the individuals that are doing this
[02:32:39.310 --> 02:32:43.310]  and trying it and all that kind of stuff like Ryan, you know, I mean, just
[02:32:44.610 --> 02:32:48.190]  nothing, nothing could be more of a compliment to me personally than people
[02:32:48.210 --> 02:32:51.010]  saying like, yo, I'm trying this now.
[02:32:51.010 --> 02:32:55.090]  I'm finding my way, you know, because the I mean to say that where you're not
[02:32:55.110 --> 02:32:58.190]  going to make mistakes, there's not gonna be hiccups with everybody would be
[02:32:58.210 --> 02:32:59.510]  lying to you at that.
[02:32:59.910 --> 02:33:02.510]  That's why I are a lot of things that are pretty hard to do.
[02:33:03.410 --> 02:33:04.810]  Yeah, hit that Bell man.
[02:33:05.610 --> 02:33:06.310]  Mm-hmm.
[02:33:07.010 --> 02:33:09.910]  Look and we're not obviously even Peter like this whole thing.
[02:33:09.910 --> 02:33:13.390]  You obviously don't see any ads or we don't talk about products unless it's
[02:33:13.410 --> 02:33:16.010]  something that we truly believe in and spend our money on
[02:33:16.610 --> 02:33:17.310]  for a reason.
[02:33:17.310 --> 02:33:20.110]  I want Marco and I want to keep this as pure as possible.
[02:33:20.110 --> 02:33:22.410]  This is for information for the community
[02:33:23.110 --> 02:33:26.490]  so that hopefully you guys will take that and I guess at the end of the day,
[02:33:26.510 --> 02:33:28.810]  we really just ask you to tell one other person,
[02:33:29.610 --> 02:33:32.210]  you know, and if you if everybody can continue to do that,
[02:33:32.710 --> 02:33:35.890]  then this is our last, you know, one of our last maybe little ways to say like
[02:33:35.910 --> 02:33:40.090]  kind of like fuck you to Big Ag is because so many people are educated now
[02:33:40.110 --> 02:33:41.510]  that it's going to be pretty hard
[02:33:42.110 --> 02:33:43.910]  to bullshit the masses.
[02:33:45.710 --> 02:33:47.310]  Smiley, you ain't lying man.
[02:33:47.810 --> 02:33:49.710]  Monsanto will be next on the
[02:33:50.510 --> 02:33:51.810]  on the microbe train,
[02:33:52.410 --> 02:33:55.110]  you know, my son micros by Monsanto,
[02:33:55.810 --> 02:33:58.910]  yeah, talking about how they're now improving the planet, right?
[02:33:58.910 --> 02:33:59.210]  Right.
[02:33:59.210 --> 02:34:02.110]  They're better fixing all the things that have been happening.
[02:34:02.410 --> 02:34:04.210]  Yeah, man, that's the bullshit.
[02:34:04.210 --> 02:34:06.910]  That's how you know, we're winning when you start seeing them
[02:34:07.410 --> 02:34:10.890]  start mocking us and copying us, you know, that's how that's how you know,
[02:34:10.910 --> 02:34:13.110]  we're winning because we're not copying that bullshit.
[02:34:13.110 --> 02:34:13.810]  They're doing.
[02:34:17.990 --> 02:34:19.390]  I'd really like to learn.
[02:34:19.590 --> 02:34:23.490]  Hey, brother, come, come, come to my IG.
[02:34:23.490 --> 02:34:24.390]  Come see me.
[02:34:24.690 --> 02:34:25.690]  Listen to this again.
[02:34:25.690 --> 02:34:29.790]  I told you a lot about it right here in this show how to get started, man.
[02:34:30.290 --> 02:34:31.890]  Oh, yeah, so many.
[02:34:31.890 --> 02:34:32.990]  Yeah, we all do.
[02:34:33.090 --> 02:34:36.290]  Who was it, Terp Wizard that was saying, like, you should really
[02:34:36.290 --> 02:34:40.190]  and I would definitely co-sign this, you know, if you're brand new to this,
[02:34:40.190 --> 02:34:45.090]  spend a probably almost an enormous amount of time getting the free information
[02:34:45.090 --> 02:34:46.090]  that's out there.
[02:34:46.490 --> 02:34:51.890]  There's so many quality mentors, individuals, OG's that have taken time
[02:34:51.890 --> 02:34:55.990]  to put out quality content so that you absorb a lot of that stuff when you start
[02:34:55.990 --> 02:35:00.890]  to want to pay for fair price.
[02:35:01.590 --> 02:35:03.690]  K&F classes.
[02:35:05.490 --> 02:35:06.790]  Yeah, we say that a lot.
[02:35:06.790 --> 02:35:10.390]  You know, if you do go to a class, have some understanding before you go,
[02:35:10.590 --> 02:35:14.690]  like, you know, always look at all your free stuff, guys, you know?
[02:35:15.090 --> 02:35:19.690]  Well, I know I'm going to be doing some classes myself and and I was asking
[02:35:19.690 --> 02:35:25.090]  Brian earlier if we know anybody up in the Edmonton area like in Alberta,
[02:35:25.090 --> 02:35:30.390]  Canada that actually knows more about K&F than I do.
[02:35:31.690 --> 02:35:37.090]  I'd love to have some classes around here, especially this spring to help
[02:35:37.090 --> 02:35:37.790]  teach people.
[02:35:37.790 --> 02:35:42.290]  But am I really the guy that wants to be doing teaching it because I've only
[02:35:42.290 --> 02:35:47.390]  just really begun doing it myself and I don't want to make mistakes and give
[02:35:47.390 --> 02:35:49.190]  people the wrong information.
[02:35:49.690 --> 02:35:53.990]  You know, you're all right now because you're you come on, kid.
[02:35:54.090 --> 02:35:56.390]  You don't don't doubt yourself.
[02:35:57.290 --> 02:35:57.990]  Come on.
[02:35:58.290 --> 02:36:01.690]  There's some people out there that are probably five, six months into it.
[02:36:01.890 --> 02:36:02.790]  You got it, buddy.
[02:36:02.790 --> 02:36:03.790]  Behind the scenes.
[02:36:03.790 --> 02:36:08.790]  Everybody knows that and they're marketing themselves as quite the OG.
[02:36:09.590 --> 02:36:13.690]  Yeah, I get into the people that are really into this genuine.
[02:36:13.690 --> 02:36:20.190]  They always kind of preset it with like I've been doing this, but or I feel like
[02:36:20.190 --> 02:36:23.690]  I've been trying to do these things, but because they don't want to.
[02:36:24.090 --> 02:36:27.790]  It is tough to kind of learn and I don't think anybody that's really genuine
[02:36:27.790 --> 02:36:30.790]  with this wants to come off as like, hey, I got everything figured out.
[02:36:30.790 --> 02:36:34.190]  Right, you know, I have the magazine.
[02:36:34.190 --> 02:36:36.390]  You're going to be just like me, baby.
[02:36:36.790 --> 02:36:37.190]  Yeah.
[02:36:37.890 --> 02:36:41.590]  Yeah, but what we will tell you is you got to take that step and get into it
[02:36:41.590 --> 02:36:45.390]  like we are and just look at the enthusiasm guys.
[02:36:45.390 --> 02:36:46.890]  He can he's going teaching.
[02:36:46.990 --> 02:36:51.190]  I'm happy teaching things that I can and we teach what we know, you know,
[02:36:51.190 --> 02:36:52.290]  we don't know at all.
[02:36:52.290 --> 02:36:56.190]  I teach you what I know and some of my students when they come to classes,
[02:36:56.190 --> 02:36:57.990]  they have some other experiences.
[02:36:57.990 --> 02:37:02.190]  They may know some things, you know, and and we bounce that off of each other.
[02:37:02.190 --> 02:37:03.790]  That's kind of how that goes.
[02:37:04.390 --> 02:37:09.090]  But just the steps of going to someone like Ken or myself or anybody that's kind
[02:37:09.090 --> 02:37:10.990]  of has a good understanding.
[02:37:10.990 --> 02:37:14.390]  It'll help you with those little questions, you know, because you can watch
[02:37:14.390 --> 02:37:18.490]  a YouTube video, but then you can't really ask a question, you know, but you
[02:37:18.490 --> 02:37:22.490]  know, a workshop is invaluable because then you can ask that question and get a
[02:37:22.490 --> 02:37:24.690]  little deeper and understand it better.
[02:37:25.090 --> 02:37:29.790]  Yeah, I just wish I had an OHN already, but at least I got an FAA.
[02:37:30.190 --> 02:37:30.690]  Yeah.
[02:37:30.990 --> 02:37:32.690]  Yeah, that's a big step right there.
[02:37:32.690 --> 02:37:36.090]  Now you should have made it start to OHN when you started that you'd be good.
[02:37:36.390 --> 02:37:39.790]  Oh, yeah, if I had the money for that much vodka, you know.
[02:37:41.390 --> 02:37:43.790]  Hey Ken, hey, we scale up and down.
[02:37:43.790 --> 02:37:45.690]  You could do six jars this small.
[02:37:45.690 --> 02:37:46.990]  You know, you don't have to be big.
[02:37:47.390 --> 02:37:54.090]  Yeah, but I'm not going to buy six ounces, but I like five pounds because I want to
[02:37:54.090 --> 02:37:56.090]  have to buy it again and again and again.
[02:37:56.090 --> 02:37:56.890]  Right, right.
[02:37:57.090 --> 02:38:03.690]  So can you make FFL Jif and add coffee beans to it?
[02:38:03.890 --> 02:38:08.790]  I think they're trying to boost the plant, but I think for Brian, maybe that's what
[02:38:08.890 --> 02:38:14.290]  you should be doing is an FPJ and, you know, just add a few coffee beans into that and
[02:38:14.290 --> 02:38:16.590]  you wouldn't have to drink those other energy drinks, brother.
[02:38:17.890 --> 02:38:18.690]  Two for one.
[02:38:19.290 --> 02:38:20.790]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:38:21.890 --> 02:38:24.090]  Yeah, I hear you on that, man.
[02:38:24.490 --> 02:38:27.590]  I think I do the coffee in my JLF, sure.
[02:38:27.790 --> 02:38:33.990]  I'd be maybe, maybe be cautious, you know, getting too high of a concentration, but I
[02:38:33.990 --> 02:38:37.190]  bet that'd be probably fine for a nice JLF.
[02:38:37.990 --> 02:38:38.790]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:38:38.790 --> 02:38:40.790]  I haven't even thought about coffee.
[02:38:40.790 --> 02:38:42.890]  That's freaking amazing for a JLF.
[02:38:42.890 --> 02:38:44.090]  I've never even thought of that.
[02:38:44.390 --> 02:38:44.890]  Great.
[02:38:45.190 --> 02:38:52.290]  Well, I think somebody was making more of a joke on it, but I think that those kind
[02:38:52.290 --> 02:38:58.490]  of those are the accidental ideas that are absolutely amazing.
[02:38:58.490 --> 02:39:04.090]  Do we have a mod on that can take care of this adult thing here that comes up?
[02:39:04.090 --> 02:39:06.090]  I'm not sure how to do it.
[02:39:06.090 --> 02:39:09.890]  Peter, if you're there, if you can jump on to the comments, please.
[02:39:11.090 --> 02:39:16.490]  But yeah, it's there's so many happy accidents that happen in scientific labs
[02:39:16.490 --> 02:39:22.890]  that all of a sudden, you know, out of nowhere, it's like, oh, yeah, we didn't
[02:39:22.890 --> 02:39:24.290]  know that was going to happen.
[02:39:24.290 --> 02:39:31.390]  Like Aero Chocolate Bars, was somebody made a mistake when they were mixing the
[02:39:31.390 --> 02:39:35.090]  chocolate, created all these bubbles, and now we have Aero Chocolate Bars.
[02:39:35.290 --> 02:39:37.190]  We pay more for even less.
[02:39:38.990 --> 02:39:39.990]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:39:40.490 --> 02:39:41.690]  Fluff it up with air.
[02:39:41.990 --> 02:39:42.590]  Yeah, no.
[02:39:43.190 --> 02:39:44.090]  Surfactants.
[02:39:44.090 --> 02:39:47.090]  I know the Jadam makes a fantastic one.
[02:39:47.190 --> 02:39:49.590]  I'm using soap nuts by myself.
[02:39:50.090 --> 02:39:55.290]  Can you just touch on some of the other things you can use to make as a surfactant,
[02:39:55.290 --> 02:39:55.990]  my friend?
[02:39:56.790 --> 02:39:59.190]  Yeah, I like, like you said, soap nut.
[02:39:59.190 --> 02:40:00.690]  I got soap nuts going.
[02:40:00.890 --> 02:40:06.090]  I usually keep a soap nut going.
[02:40:07.490 --> 02:40:09.290]  Soap nuts so cheap.
[02:40:10.490 --> 02:40:17.390]  The Quijaja root, you can find that root, the Q, and I found that root online and
[02:40:17.390 --> 02:40:18.490]  I just ferment my own.
[02:40:18.490 --> 02:40:23.690]  And this is just, I'm just doing it like an FPE with the airlock, lactic acid
[02:40:23.790 --> 02:40:31.890]  bacteria in here, sugar, water, soap nuts, and then just leave it in here and then
[02:40:31.890 --> 02:40:33.190]  I'll strain that off.
[02:40:34.090 --> 02:40:35.290]  But yeah, I like aloe.
[02:40:35.390 --> 02:40:36.290]  Aloe is great.
[02:40:36.590 --> 02:40:37.190]  Yucca.
[02:40:37.190 --> 02:40:38.690]  Brian always talks about the yucca.
[02:40:38.690 --> 02:40:39.990]  A lot of people run yucca.
[02:40:41.190 --> 02:40:43.590]  And soap nut in the Q is wonderful.
[02:40:44.590 --> 02:40:50.190]  And of course, like you said, the Jadam, JWA, if you can make that, that's a good
[02:40:50.190 --> 02:40:51.090]  one to make too.
[02:40:51.990 --> 02:40:53.890]  But yeah, surfactants, wetting agents.
[02:40:53.890 --> 02:40:58.390]  And what we're doing is we're talking about is like when you water your plants or if
[02:40:58.390 --> 02:41:04.290]  you notice you wash your car and the water runs off, what we want is we want the water
[02:41:04.290 --> 02:41:05.090]  to stick.
[02:41:05.290 --> 02:41:10.190]  So what we do is make these soap, pretty much soaps, natural soaps, if you will.
[02:41:10.590 --> 02:41:14.490]  And what they do is when you combine them with your foliar feeds, now it's going to
[02:41:14.490 --> 02:41:17.390]  get a good coating on that leaf and it'll be very even.
[02:41:17.790 --> 02:41:23.190]  And instead of just beads and running off, it'll just stay and be nice and coated.
[02:41:24.190 --> 02:41:28.890]  And if you want to take that stuff to the next level by an atomizer and then make sure
[02:41:28.890 --> 02:41:34.090]  you're using the surfactants and you're going to see a really big difference, especially
[02:41:34.090 --> 02:41:37.890]  if you're farming cannabis with like a larger footprint.
[02:41:38.590 --> 02:41:39.690]  Yeah, great points.
[02:41:39.690 --> 02:41:45.190]  And these are great for like pests, IPM too, you know, because the way they work is if
[02:41:45.190 --> 02:41:50.590]  you do have pests, they coat the pests and then they can't breathe because it's got
[02:41:50.590 --> 02:41:54.090]  that same wetting agent as you know, that's coating that leaf evenly.
[02:41:54.090 --> 02:41:57.590]  If it coats the insect the same way, then now it'll suffocate it out.
[02:41:58.890 --> 02:42:04.890]  I like to definitely foliar spray FAA combined with the wetting agent.
[02:42:05.890 --> 02:42:09.890]  FAA, believe it or not, is great at preventing mites.
[02:42:10.290 --> 02:42:13.690]  It's such a thin coating of oil on the surface of the leaves.
[02:42:13.690 --> 02:42:17.990]  If you look at it, you zoom into their level, thin coating of oil.
[02:42:17.990 --> 02:42:21.090]  You're talking about tiny mites.
[02:42:21.590 --> 02:42:23.290]  They can't really get established.
[02:42:23.290 --> 02:42:27.790]  So it's a good deterrent to keep a coating of FAA during veg.
[02:42:27.790 --> 02:42:32.690]  And yeah, using the wetting agents like Kim brought up, really easy to do.
[02:42:33.490 --> 02:42:39.690]  Get these airlocks a couple of bucks on Amazon, get an old juice bottle to make you easy FPE.
[02:42:40.590 --> 02:42:44.690]  I mean, you know, some of that stuff is expensive, guys.
[02:42:44.690 --> 02:42:48.990]  Y'all see it out there and that's fine to support good people and good products.
[02:42:48.990 --> 02:42:53.290]  But if you can make some of this stuff, man, spend money on something else, you know.
[02:42:54.890 --> 02:43:00.790]  Okay, now when you were making your nutrient there, were you putting in a surfactant with that?
[02:43:00.790 --> 02:43:06.190]  Are you going to do that just before you spray or add to water it in?
[02:43:06.790 --> 02:43:09.390]  Okay, so like how we just demonstrated back here.
[02:43:09.390 --> 02:43:11.890]  Yeah, right at the end as one of my inputs.
[02:43:12.290 --> 02:43:17.290]  Then I'll go ahead and add that surfactant in before I water, stir it up real good.
[02:43:17.290 --> 02:43:18.390]  And then now I'm ready to go.
[02:43:20.790 --> 02:43:28.190]  You'll get you'll get praying leaves from that, especially if you add a little like agricultural Epsom salt.
[02:43:29.590 --> 02:43:34.490]  It's like a tried and true way to play around with that stuff, you know, cautiously.
[02:43:34.790 --> 02:43:41.090]  But spray with a surfactant and then spray a foiler with a with some Epsom salt and see what happens.
[02:43:41.590 --> 02:43:46.390]  Another good one, guys, out of Jadam as far as IPM.
[02:43:47.290 --> 02:43:49.490]  These are this is a Moroccan clay.
[02:43:49.790 --> 02:43:56.590]  So what this is, I found these discovered these very fine micronized clays.
[02:43:56.690 --> 02:43:59.190]  They come from the beauty industry.
[02:43:59.590 --> 02:44:03.190]  My wife is an esthetician, so they do a lot of skin care.
[02:44:04.690 --> 02:44:11.190]  With Jadam, you can add these very fine clays to water and now foliar them on your leaves.
[02:44:11.390 --> 02:44:17.490]  And now that clay is also a very microscopic barrier to pests.
[02:44:18.190 --> 02:44:19.590]  So just something to think about there.
[02:44:19.590 --> 02:44:21.890]  And I also add these when I'm building my soil.
[02:44:22.190 --> 02:44:24.090]  I like these micronized clays.
[02:44:24.790 --> 02:44:33.190]  They've got very high CEC, cation exchange capacity, meaning how much nutrient they can hold.
[02:44:34.190 --> 02:44:38.790]  And they're so fine that they just blend really well into the soil.
[02:44:38.790 --> 02:44:46.090]  So so you can kind of blend it in also as more of maybe a proactive IPM with the clays.
[02:44:46.690 --> 02:44:55.690]  Yeah. So I can take a teaspoon of this clay, add it with with a water or solution along with a little surfactant and now spray that on my leaves.
[02:44:55.690 --> 02:45:02.290]  And now when that dries, you know how that dusty look that dusty coating will be on your leaves.
[02:45:02.390 --> 02:45:07.390]  It's not enough to stop photosynthesis, but it's enough to to propel pests.
[02:45:07.390 --> 02:45:10.790]  So when a pest now lands on this, it feels like he just landed on some clay.
[02:45:10.790 --> 02:45:12.390]  Like it doesn't feel like he's on a plant.
[02:45:12.390 --> 02:45:16.290]  So he doesn't necessarily jump in and start eating that.
[02:45:17.290 --> 02:45:20.290]  That's the mindset behind the Jadam using the clays.
[02:45:21.290 --> 02:45:22.790]  Yeah, that's really interesting.
[02:45:22.890 --> 02:45:24.690]  Yeah, for sure.
[02:45:25.190 --> 02:45:27.190]  Yeah. So that's that's kind of cool.
[02:45:27.290 --> 02:45:30.090]  And you play around with a variety of different clays, right?
[02:45:30.190 --> 02:45:32.190]  Diversity is kind of important there as well.
[02:45:32.490 --> 02:45:34.190]  Yeah, I do the diversity.
[02:45:34.190 --> 02:45:36.090]  So that's Moroccan.
[02:45:36.090 --> 02:45:41.990]  This is Rasul, another lighter clay from a different part of the world.
[02:45:43.690 --> 02:45:45.190]  French green clay.
[02:45:46.490 --> 02:45:49.690]  And it's really green from the coast of France.
[02:45:50.090 --> 02:45:51.290]  Very nutritious.
[02:45:53.190 --> 02:45:53.790]  And I have.
[02:45:54.790 --> 02:45:56.990]  Oh yeah, one more.
[02:45:59.690 --> 02:46:03.090]  And it's probably my favorite one, just sea clay.
[02:46:03.990 --> 02:46:07.790]  You know, these are all harvested from various places all around the world.
[02:46:07.790 --> 02:46:12.790]  Super fine micronized for the beauty industry.
[02:46:12.890 --> 02:46:15.790]  Very good for for our our industry as well.
[02:46:16.490 --> 02:46:20.890]  Now, pricing wise, is that something that's an investment or is that fairly cheap?
[02:46:21.890 --> 02:46:24.090]  Oh, five pounds.
[02:46:24.490 --> 02:46:28.390]  I have to look, Brian, but I remember saying it wasn't that bad.
[02:46:29.590 --> 02:46:31.990]  I remember in my mind saying, damn, that's not bad.
[02:46:31.990 --> 02:46:33.890]  So I bought all the different ones I had.
[02:46:35.190 --> 02:46:35.790]  Look it up.
[02:46:35.790 --> 02:46:37.490]  I think it's fairly reasonable.
[02:46:37.490 --> 02:46:41.290]  It's going to be a lot less than any like kind of amendments that we will be buying,
[02:46:42.290 --> 02:46:43.590]  you know, different places.
[02:46:43.590 --> 02:46:45.390]  But but just check it out.
[02:46:45.590 --> 02:46:48.190]  Yeah, I'm going to play around with that, especially in the worm bins.
[02:46:48.490 --> 02:46:50.990]  Yeah, I think that's where you really kick up.
[02:46:51.990 --> 02:46:53.990]  Yeah, definitely is worth it.
[02:46:54.190 --> 02:46:56.290]  You know, different clays, different Brazil.
[02:46:56.290 --> 02:46:59.290]  And you can read up on them like each one is from a different region.
[02:46:59.290 --> 02:47:02.790]  And it kind of gives you some input about what's in them and stuff.
[02:47:02.790 --> 02:47:04.390]  So I think it's pretty cool.
[02:47:05.390 --> 02:47:12.590]  Well, one thing that I remember, I had a friend that she actually brought clay in from the Dead Sea.
[02:47:13.090 --> 02:47:17.190]  She was using it in massage therapy and mud baths.
[02:47:17.390 --> 02:47:17.790]  Yes.
[02:47:17.790 --> 02:47:19.790]  Yeah, the different clays.
[02:47:20.890 --> 02:47:26.790]  Leighton's always talking about going out and finding those colored clays when you're wild crafting.
[02:47:27.290 --> 02:47:35.290]  And those are going to be have a lot of different available nutrients and biology in them.
[02:47:35.690 --> 02:47:43.590]  And adding that in, it's not going to hurt it if it's either going to be a bio stimulant or, you know, somebody's eating somebody.
[02:47:44.090 --> 02:47:46.790]  Somebody's eating somebody all the time.
[02:47:46.990 --> 02:47:47.890]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:47:48.390 --> 02:47:54.290]  And I like these are and they're so micronized that you can tell they're like if I was to open it, it could really dust up.
[02:47:54.290 --> 02:47:55.690]  I mean, like they're so fine.
[02:47:55.690 --> 02:47:58.390]  So really it could fit in the earthworms mouth is how I'm looking.
[02:47:58.390 --> 02:47:59.890]  I'm looking at it on that level.
[02:47:59.890 --> 02:48:01.090]  It's very, very good.
[02:48:01.190 --> 02:48:01.790]  Good stuff.
[02:48:04.960 --> 02:48:12.960]  Yeah, I think you might also be onto something about breeding springtails, maybe even potentially rove beetles if it works with the springtails.
[02:48:13.460 --> 02:48:16.160]  Because sometimes that's built on clay.
[02:48:16.160 --> 02:48:24.660]  So I'd imagine if you had diverse clay options kind of mixed together, that that potential to have huge benefits.
[02:48:25.260 --> 02:48:26.160]  So that's something else, man.
[02:48:26.160 --> 02:48:27.660]  I'm going to obviously play around.
[02:48:27.960 --> 02:48:32.560]  I'm hoping to get some orange springtails and some blue springtails here soon.
[02:48:33.260 --> 02:48:39.860]  So I really kind of want to play around with that stuff and see, you know, I think for the most part, it's more of a cosmetic thing.
[02:48:39.860 --> 02:48:45.460]  But really building up those soil systems, no matter what you're doing, is really a fun.
[02:48:45.760 --> 02:48:47.860]  It's like a little fun project in a way.
[02:48:47.860 --> 02:48:49.060]  It's like bonsai, right?
[02:48:49.060 --> 02:48:58.160]  And when you get when you're kind of doing the cover crop and everything, it's it's like a fun way for me, I feel like to kind of really start to build up those soil systems.
[02:48:58.160 --> 02:49:05.460]  And then the majority of individuals that do build soil systems find a way to monetize that skill set.
[02:49:06.560 --> 02:49:07.360]  Yeah, definitely.
[02:49:07.360 --> 02:49:07.860]  Good point.
[02:49:07.860 --> 02:49:08.560]  Peace of mind.
[02:49:08.560 --> 02:49:09.060]  Yeah, man.
[02:49:09.060 --> 02:49:09.660]  Clays.
[02:49:09.760 --> 02:49:10.860]  Clays are wonderful.
[02:49:12.760 --> 02:49:14.560]  And it's all about that diversity.
[02:49:14.860 --> 02:49:16.460]  Red Wigglers from Walmart.
[02:49:16.460 --> 02:49:23.860]  Yeah, but I mean, I would say I would if you're going to go to Walmart route, I would I would buy them from Uncle Jim.
[02:49:24.860 --> 02:49:28.560]  I think those would be still a better route for you than than Walmart.
[02:49:28.860 --> 02:49:37.560]  I think he's saying just walk into the fish department of Walmart, probably getting a couple of packs as opposed to those who always seem pretty.
[02:49:39.060 --> 02:49:41.360]  Those are usually extremely unhealthy.
[02:49:41.660 --> 02:49:48.260]  Even the ones that I've noticed in Petco and stuff, they are set on the shelf for probably months before anybody's gone and gotten them.
[02:49:48.660 --> 02:49:52.260]  Yeah, you got to go somewhere with high fish and a lot of fishing going on, man.
[02:49:52.260 --> 02:49:55.560]  If you're going to a bait shop because you want that turnover.
[02:49:56.060 --> 02:50:02.660]  Or you want to find somebody that's like I bought my first pound out of an organic store in Edmonton.
[02:50:03.460 --> 02:50:06.560]  They're bringing them in from a local guy.
[02:50:06.960 --> 02:50:10.960]  And I just phoned around to the health food stores and went, you guys got worms?
[02:50:10.960 --> 02:50:11.660]  You guys got worms?
[02:50:11.660 --> 02:50:13.860]  Until I found somebody that said, yeah, we got worms.
[02:50:13.860 --> 02:50:14.660]  How many you want?
[02:50:15.360 --> 02:50:16.560]  You know, but Walmart.
[02:50:17.160 --> 02:50:21.860]  Yeah, like guys, guys, guys smack.
[02:50:22.160 --> 02:50:24.460]  If that's all you got, man, do you?
[02:50:24.460 --> 02:50:24.760]  True.
[02:50:24.960 --> 02:50:25.960]  Available to you.
[02:50:25.960 --> 02:50:30.960]  I'm not going to tell you don't have a worm bin because you can't afford Uncle Jim's or you can't do that.
[02:50:30.960 --> 02:50:34.760]  If you fuck, go outside and put a piece of cardboard on the ground.
[02:50:34.760 --> 02:50:36.860]  You'll have worms under there in a few days.
[02:50:37.160 --> 02:50:40.860]  There's a there's lots of ways to go about it to get into the game.
[02:50:40.860 --> 02:50:44.460]  But like Brian said, get go to Big Jim, Uncle Jim's.
[02:50:44.460 --> 02:50:46.960]  He's going to turn in where he's got.
[02:50:47.660 --> 02:50:56.960]  Yeah, if you're going if you're going that route, which we all usually start off with, you know, your money is going to go a lot further instead of probably getting like just maybe even 50 worms.
[02:50:57.460 --> 02:51:02.060]  You might be able to get a couple hundred or if you're going to spend a little bit of money, you might be able to get a couple thousand.
[02:51:02.360 --> 02:51:07.760]  And that's really going to benefit you in the long run because they're going to double their population every 90 days.
[02:51:08.260 --> 02:51:13.460]  So you can really build out a nice little system for yourself with a small investment and a little bit of time.
[02:51:13.860 --> 02:51:21.460]  Yeah. Red Wigglers are the African Red Wigglers are your number one composting worm.
[02:51:21.460 --> 02:51:25.060]  Then you got jumpers, which I have here to outdoors.
[02:51:25.760 --> 02:51:26.460]  They're cool.
[02:51:26.460 --> 02:51:28.660]  They're if your soil system is big enough.
[02:51:28.660 --> 02:51:30.560]  I recommend using the night crawlers.
[02:51:31.060 --> 02:51:37.560]  Actually, I used to teach like the four horsemen of composting worms because the Red Wigglers are going to stay at the top.
[02:51:38.160 --> 02:51:45.760]  Basically, the rhizosphere, they're going to really kind of just churn that in a way, build up oxygen channels, really just maintain that system for you.
[02:51:46.060 --> 02:51:54.160]  The night crawlers are going to build the oxygen channels on a whole nother level because the reason why they're called night crawlers is they come up at night to feed.
[02:51:54.360 --> 02:51:56.660]  So you got a lot of stuff going up and down with them.
[02:51:57.160 --> 02:51:58.560]  And then you can use the jumpers.
[02:51:58.960 --> 02:52:02.260]  Alabama, Georgia, depends on whether you prefer.
[02:52:02.260 --> 02:52:04.260]  But obviously, I call them Georgia jumpers.
[02:52:04.560 --> 02:52:08.160]  For the most part, they're going to stay way down deep into those soil systems.
[02:52:08.160 --> 02:52:11.660]  And to really achieve that, you're going to need 30 gallons or more.
[02:52:11.660 --> 02:52:13.460]  I would probably say like 40, 50.
[02:52:13.660 --> 02:52:17.560]  I mean, that's going to be probably something that you're not necessarily going to move.
[02:52:18.160 --> 02:52:23.760]  But you can use all four of those in conjunction if the stomach, the soil system is large enough.
[02:52:24.760 --> 02:52:29.260]  Well, I know for night crawlers up here, I actually tried to keep some.
[02:52:29.660 --> 02:52:35.560]  And the thing is, they can go down seven or eight feet in the wintertime here.
[02:52:35.760 --> 02:52:43.360]  When your frost goes into the ground, the night crawlers have to go much further down below that frost line to survive.
[02:52:44.160 --> 02:52:45.360]  And then they come back up.
[02:52:45.460 --> 02:52:54.560]  So for us, yeah, we have to have a very deep bed because they want to go all the way down and get down in there deep.
[02:52:55.360 --> 02:52:58.860]  So, yeah, that's what I found on the night crawler end of it anyway.
[02:52:59.760 --> 02:53:06.560]  And from my experience, the Canadian night crawler, we never recommended that one because of that aspect.
[02:53:06.760 --> 02:53:15.060]  We would use the European and African night crawler because the Canadians were the only ones that kept getting out of the system.
[02:53:15.560 --> 02:53:18.860]  Baby, we can't be putting it in a box, OK?
[02:53:21.860 --> 02:53:27.460]  So from my experience, don't use the Canadian night crawlers, use the African and the European.
[02:53:28.160 --> 02:53:35.160]  The jumper, if you have a big enough system and if you're just really any system, the red wiggler is where you want to start.
[02:53:35.860 --> 02:53:36.560]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:53:37.360 --> 02:53:38.160]  Yeah, very true.
[02:53:38.760 --> 02:53:41.860]  And it can be as easy as a tote.
[02:53:42.160 --> 02:53:48.060]  Cut the bottom out of the tote, put a small mesh screen on the bottom.
[02:53:49.660 --> 02:53:55.060]  And OK, Canadian worms were too polite.
[02:53:58.060 --> 02:53:58.860]  That's funny.
[02:53:59.160 --> 02:54:00.860]  But yeah, I just have two totes.
[02:54:00.860 --> 02:54:06.160]  I cut the bottom out of one and I put a mesh screen on the bottom just with some zip ties.
[02:54:06.560 --> 02:54:18.060]  I loaded it up with some dirt and stuff and I actually use my good dirt and my compost and then I feed that to my worms and then I get my worm castings out of that.
[02:54:18.060 --> 02:54:23.060]  And it's as simple as two to eight dollar totes out of Walmart.
[02:54:23.260 --> 02:54:33.060]  You know, I hate to Walmart, but you know, and having a lid, make sure you have vent holes and you can put all your scraps in there and have constant worms.
[02:54:33.060 --> 02:54:35.560]  It's because of the mesh.
[02:54:35.760 --> 02:54:44.260]  It can be considered a pass through system and you'll actually have the worm castings dropping out of the bottom if you just give it a little shake.
[02:54:45.960 --> 02:54:47.160]  Yeah, that's a great system.
[02:54:47.360 --> 02:54:48.860]  He just grabbed there, guys.
[02:54:48.860 --> 02:54:49.960]  That was a gold bar.
[02:54:50.560 --> 02:54:56.660]  And also what Brian said about the diversity of worms, four, three, four different types in there, man.
[02:54:56.660 --> 02:54:58.160]  Get that diversity up.
[02:54:58.260 --> 02:55:05.960]  You know, like you said, Wigglers up top, working on that leaf stuff, crawlers digging down deep and bringing stuff up and back down.
[02:55:05.960 --> 02:55:06.560]  You know what I mean?
[02:55:06.560 --> 02:55:08.560]  It's all, it's all diversity.
[02:55:10.160 --> 02:55:13.660]  And everything in our lives has got to be balanced in diversity.
[02:55:13.660 --> 02:55:19.660]  The more diversity you have, you know, it's what makes this world, this world.
[02:55:19.660 --> 02:55:23.060]  If we don't have that, we're not going to be around very much longer.
[02:55:23.060 --> 02:55:24.860]  Brian, you had something to say, my friend.
[02:55:25.060 --> 02:55:26.260]  I see it in your eyes.
[02:55:26.760 --> 02:55:37.560]  Well, I just want to say the night crawlers, when they do make the bigger channels, that microbial life falls down in there.
[02:55:37.560 --> 02:55:49.260]  And it seems like if there is enough oxygen deeper into that system, the springtails will survive on a deeper level than in normal ways when you're not using the night crawlers.
[02:55:49.260 --> 02:55:51.160]  So I just wanted to put that caveat in them.
[02:55:51.560 --> 02:55:53.260]  I'm usually not that easy to read.
[02:55:53.260 --> 02:55:56.160]  So Ken, you should be playing cards against me.
[02:55:56.160 --> 02:55:58.960]  Oh, Brian, you better tighten up.
[02:56:02.460 --> 02:56:03.560]  You're muted, Ken.
[02:56:04.560 --> 02:56:05.760]  Yeah, we can't hear you, buddy.
[02:56:06.960 --> 02:56:07.560]  Oh, sorry.
[02:56:07.560 --> 02:56:19.860]  I was saying I've never done live poker, but I've studied human nature to the extent where I can read that flick on the end of your nose just as well as your wife can.
[02:56:19.860 --> 02:56:20.460]  Okay.
[02:56:23.760 --> 02:56:25.260]  Let me turn my camera off.
[02:56:25.860 --> 02:56:39.860]  You know, there's always stuff going on when you're trying to think things through and having these little extra gold bars where people go out and maybe, you know, instead of just trying one composting worm, they're either, you know, they're running a variety of them.
[02:56:40.160 --> 02:56:43.660]  And I've also seen that there's obviously composting worms.
[02:56:43.660 --> 02:56:51.860]  And then to me, there's there's also earthworms where those are more like digging channels, but it seems like they're leaving their manure at the top.
[02:56:52.160 --> 02:56:54.660]  I have never seen that from a composting worm.
[02:56:56.260 --> 02:57:08.760]  Oh, yeah, you're right, because the even in my yard, like the night crawlers, they come up, they leave little mounds of poop like, you know, you see them on the surface, whereas the composting guys just kind of poop live in their poop.
[02:57:09.060 --> 02:57:09.860]  It's kind of cool.
[02:57:11.560 --> 02:57:15.760]  As for them surviving outdoors in a bin at 100 degree.
[02:57:15.960 --> 02:57:23.360]  Yes, you just have to keep them shaded and you have to keep the moisture content, you know, up to that 60, 70%.
[02:57:23.460 --> 02:57:28.860]  And, you know, they can stand the heat as long as they have the moisture.
[02:57:28.860 --> 02:57:30.560]  You know, it's like the plant.
[02:57:30.860 --> 02:57:33.560]  If you don't they don't have moisture that dry up, they die.
[02:57:34.360 --> 02:57:35.060]  Who knew?
[02:57:36.860 --> 02:57:37.860]  What and exactly.
[02:57:37.860 --> 02:57:46.360]  So when you are trying to do that kind of stuff where it's extremely hot like that, 100 plus cover crop, in my opinion, is paramount because of that shade.
[02:57:46.660 --> 02:57:49.960]  So, you know, you're just building up that organic matter.
[02:57:50.160 --> 02:57:55.560]  You can obviously chop and drop, but for the most part that's being used as shade while things start to build up.
[02:57:59.660 --> 02:58:00.960]  Fish worms here.
[02:58:01.660 --> 02:58:04.160]  So the Canadian worms are good, Brian.
[02:58:04.160 --> 02:58:05.160]  You're wrong, buddy.
[02:58:05.560 --> 02:58:06.060]  They're good.
[02:58:06.060 --> 02:58:06.560]  They're good.
[02:58:06.560 --> 02:58:10.260]  Just not quite in our soil, but, you know, good for catching bass.
[02:58:10.560 --> 02:58:11.760]  Oh, they're fantastic.
[02:58:12.360 --> 02:58:18.460]  And again, no disrespect, but they're fantastic for fish bait because they're unintelligent from what I've understood.
[02:58:18.960 --> 02:58:20.660]  The way it's always been explained to me.
[02:58:20.960 --> 02:58:23.460]  They're used as bait because they have.
[02:58:24.460 --> 02:58:26.560]  And why do you take home back in school?
[02:58:26.560 --> 02:58:28.660]  Because that's where the chicks are.
[02:58:28.660 --> 02:58:29.160]  Okay.
[02:58:30.860 --> 02:58:32.260]  That's where the food was.
[02:58:34.260 --> 02:58:35.560]  I know I'm going to say a thing.
[02:58:35.560 --> 02:58:38.660]  My wife says to Brian, you know, I'm going to get a something.
[02:58:38.660 --> 02:58:40.760]  But two minutes left.
[02:58:41.160 --> 02:58:45.560]  I don't know if we want to take a few more questions or if you guys are starting to get hungry.
[02:58:45.760 --> 02:58:48.060]  I don't mind going on a fast all day.
[02:58:48.060 --> 02:58:48.560]  So.
[02:58:49.460 --> 02:58:50.960]  How about I got stuff to do?
[02:58:50.960 --> 02:58:51.760]  Five o'clock.
[02:58:51.760 --> 02:58:53.660]  That's usually where I'll put it in.
[02:58:53.660 --> 02:58:54.160]  One.
[02:58:54.360 --> 02:58:56.760]  I've started getting more even to one meal a day.
[02:58:56.760 --> 02:58:59.660]  So I don't know if anybody's kind of gotten into that, but.
[02:58:59.660 --> 02:59:06.660]  I've done that on a straight carnivore, but I had to eat like a pound and a half of meat at one sitting.
[02:59:06.960 --> 02:59:11.660]  And then, yeah, I was good for, you know, 23, 24 hours before I had to eat again.
[02:59:12.060 --> 02:59:13.260]  Well, hell, a pound of meat.
[02:59:13.260 --> 02:59:15.760]  That was a lot of work to digest.
[02:59:16.860 --> 02:59:20.660]  Well, you do it in that, you know, a couple of hour block and you get through it.
[02:59:20.860 --> 02:59:24.160]  But that's all my body needed until, you know, the next day.
[02:59:24.160 --> 02:59:26.260]  I didn't have any cravings whatsoever.
[02:59:26.760 --> 02:59:27.260]  Nice.
[02:59:28.760 --> 02:59:31.760]  Yeah, there's a difference when it when it turns from carbohydrates.
[02:59:32.360 --> 02:59:33.960]  Yeah, you got worms.
[02:59:34.560 --> 02:59:35.960]  Everybody should have worms.
[02:59:36.360 --> 02:59:46.360]  I mean, it's it's like having your own little factory system and so many individuals, you know, at the beginning, especially when you're doing more of like the tent kind of consulting.
[02:59:46.660 --> 02:59:52.560]  They would brag about how much any worm castings, you know, how many pounds of worm castings they had purchased.
[02:59:52.860 --> 02:59:59.860]  And that always baffled me because you could just put that same amount of money, probably half of that money into the actual factories themselves.
[03:00:00.260 --> 03:00:01.660]  Not in 90 days.
[03:00:01.660 --> 03:00:03.060]  I mean, you're off to the races.
[03:00:03.060 --> 03:00:07.460]  You start even with a thousand and then it just pops off to roughly around 2000.
[03:00:07.460 --> 03:00:11.860]  And then, you know, time's going by, life's going by within just a couple of years.
[03:00:11.860 --> 03:00:14.660]  I mean, you have you have something very valuable.
[03:00:16.260 --> 03:00:17.460]  Good job, little Mac.
[03:00:17.560 --> 03:00:18.760]  Very well said, Brian.
[03:00:18.760 --> 03:00:19.260]  Shit, man.
[03:00:19.260 --> 03:00:26.360]  You could make a worm bin and feed all your old soil to it and just step your you know, a lot of guys were throwing soil away.
[03:00:26.360 --> 03:00:32.060]  If they'd only made a big worm bin through the old soil in there and, you know, went right back into the game.
[03:00:32.660 --> 03:00:33.960]  Well, yeah, just a little more.
[03:00:34.460 --> 03:00:35.160]  Oh, sorry, Brian.
[03:00:35.160 --> 03:00:35.460]  Go ahead.
[03:00:35.460 --> 03:00:43.460]  I was going to say drizzle the worm castings over your your wife's plants, you know, over like the next few weeks and watch them start to bounce back.
[03:00:43.660 --> 03:00:45.060]  Just don't over the wife.
[03:00:45.760 --> 03:00:46.960]  Yeah, don't tell her.
[03:00:46.960 --> 03:00:48.860]  Just watch that stuff start to bounce back.
[03:00:49.160 --> 03:00:50.160]  She'll notice too.
[03:00:50.860 --> 03:00:53.960]  And again, it's not necessarily nutrients from worm castings.
[03:00:53.960 --> 03:00:57.960]  What you're actually after is the biology that's on that.
[03:00:58.360 --> 03:01:00.160]  You cannot buy that in a store.
[03:01:00.660 --> 03:01:06.860]  So if you're able to figure out how to make that, especially if you're in your early 20s, man, are you fucking on the races?
[03:01:06.860 --> 03:01:25.460]  If you want to become a, you know, a cannabis farmer that that is putting out real quality medicine with the the floral and the look to it, because more and more individuals are obviously saying that it is extremely hard to do, especially in a perpetual motion.
[03:01:26.160 --> 03:01:26.660]  Yeah.
[03:01:27.360 --> 03:01:27.760]  Okay.
[03:01:27.760 --> 03:01:29.660]  Now that's one earthworm.
[03:01:29.660 --> 03:01:32.360]  I don't want to meet in a dark alley.
[03:01:32.360 --> 03:01:34.960]  Okay, meter long and three inches.
[03:01:36.660 --> 03:01:38.860]  Yeah, I didn't know there were Australia.
[03:01:39.260 --> 03:01:40.960]  I think those are night crawlers.
[03:01:43.260 --> 03:01:45.360]  Might be talking back alleys somewhere.
[03:01:45.360 --> 03:01:45.960]  All right.
[03:01:47.460 --> 03:01:48.460]  They're huge.
[03:01:49.560 --> 03:01:51.160]  A red light district, maybe.
[03:01:53.460 --> 03:01:56.160]  Anyway, guys, we're just over three hours.
[03:01:56.760 --> 03:01:57.960]  Do you guys want to cut it here?
[03:01:57.960 --> 03:01:58.960]  You want to carry on?
[03:01:59.360 --> 03:02:00.060]  Cut.
[03:02:00.660 --> 03:02:01.860]  Okay, Brian.
[03:02:01.860 --> 03:02:02.260]  Thank you.
[03:02:02.660 --> 03:02:04.460]  This show went by quick, man.
[03:02:04.460 --> 03:02:06.360]  This was like, really didn't it?
[03:02:06.360 --> 03:02:07.760]  It's like flew by in a way.
[03:02:07.960 --> 03:02:09.160]  Well, we're in the flow, man.
[03:02:09.160 --> 03:02:10.460]  That's what they always talk about, right?
[03:02:10.460 --> 03:02:14.460]  If you're in the flow and people are hopefully also vibing with it.
[03:02:14.860 --> 03:02:15.960]  Yeah, time goes by.
[03:02:16.160 --> 03:02:16.960]  Okay, Marco.
[03:02:16.960 --> 03:02:17.760]  How about you?
[03:02:17.760 --> 03:02:19.560]  Kona sock on us over other.
[03:02:20.360 --> 03:02:20.760]  All right.
[03:02:20.760 --> 03:02:28.160]  Well, family, we're gonna head out and hope y'all got something from this and definitely watch this again.
[03:02:28.260 --> 03:02:31.760]  Because I think we dropped some things that you could learn some stuff from.
[03:02:31.760 --> 03:02:32.660]  So watch her again.
[03:02:32.660 --> 03:02:34.360]  I'll let Brian get the last word.
[03:02:34.460 --> 03:02:36.360]  We got to get a guest for next week.
[03:02:36.860 --> 03:02:37.960]  I think I'm on that buddy.
[03:02:38.160 --> 03:02:38.460]  Yeah.
[03:02:38.460 --> 03:02:38.760]  All right.
[03:02:38.760 --> 03:02:39.360]  Good deal.
[03:02:39.460 --> 03:02:40.160]  Hopefully so.
[03:02:40.860 --> 03:02:42.760]  Yeah, and we want to minimize mistakes.
[03:02:42.960 --> 03:02:50.860]  That's another reason why, you know, tomorrow we're having Professor Q on a lot of people in the community respect what he's what he's about.
[03:02:50.860 --> 03:02:56.260]  You know, he's definitely one of those that has been open and honest about his journey and now he's crushing it.
[03:02:56.660 --> 03:03:01.560]  Getting a lot of respect from a variety of well-known individuals in the community.
[03:03:02.060 --> 03:03:07.660]  So just another another individual that I know the community is going to be happy that we took the time to pick their brain.
[03:03:08.560 --> 03:03:09.260]  Brilliant.
[03:03:09.660 --> 03:03:11.060]  Can't wait till tomorrow.
[03:03:11.560 --> 03:03:13.860]  All right, guys, we're gonna get in the broadcast.
