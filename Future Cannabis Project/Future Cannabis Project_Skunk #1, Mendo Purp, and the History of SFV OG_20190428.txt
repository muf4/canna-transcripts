[00:00.000 --> 00:02.560]  I've been doing this since 1986.
[00:02.560 --> 00:04.320]  Woo! That's fun too.
[00:04.320 --> 00:10.000]  So talk to me about strains from the past that you can't find anymore.
[00:10.000 --> 00:12.000]  Skunk one.
[00:12.000 --> 00:13.360]  Skunk one.
[00:13.360 --> 00:18.640]  True skunk one. The golf ball indica. Nobody has it anymore.
[00:21.920 --> 00:25.600]  That one. The original Mendo Purple.
[00:28.080 --> 00:29.600]  Golf ball indicas.
[00:30.240 --> 00:30.880]  It's gone.
[00:32.000 --> 00:38.880]  You saw it coming out of Mendocino, Ukiah, that area.
[00:41.120 --> 00:45.120]  And it was just phenomenal. Just absolutely phenomenal.
[00:46.880 --> 00:51.520]  And it's gone. It disappeared in the early 90s. Both of those.
[00:52.640 --> 00:53.440]  Both of those did.
[00:54.720 --> 00:58.160]  The camp raids were more effective than people think they were.
[00:58.240 --> 00:59.440]  From zero?
[00:59.440 --> 01:06.320]  I mean, yeah, a lot of grows were left intact up there, but a lot of strains were lost. A lot.
[01:07.840 --> 01:10.080]  By just attrition or by...
[01:11.760 --> 01:15.680]  By both. By both. Cross breeding the seeds,
[01:16.320 --> 01:22.080]  you know, pollination that people didn't really know where that pollen came from, you know.
[01:22.720 --> 01:29.840]  I mean, we had some great sticky weed in the late 80s, early 90s.
[01:29.840 --> 01:32.000]  Where were you growing in the late 80s, early 90s?
[01:32.000 --> 01:33.040]  San Fernando Valley.
[01:35.760 --> 01:39.200]  So talk about the SFV OG.
[01:39.200 --> 01:46.400]  So I still have that strain. I've had it for 27 years, continuously cloned.
[01:46.400 --> 01:49.120]  But what's the history of it? What's the...
[01:49.200 --> 01:55.200]  So it actually came in through Point Lagoo Naval Air Station in a backpack
[01:55.760 --> 02:01.040]  from those old Navy SEALs that were working in Afghanistan. That's where it came from.
[02:02.160 --> 02:03.120]  That's where it came from.
[02:03.120 --> 02:04.000]  And you got a cut.
[02:04.000 --> 02:09.360]  And I got a cut. I got a bag of seeds, you know, directly out of there.
[02:10.480 --> 02:13.840]  And what made that a standout cultivar?
[02:14.480 --> 02:18.800]  Purely a fact.
[02:19.920 --> 02:23.440]  It is the original PK.
[02:24.400 --> 02:32.480]  So SFV OG, its original name was PK, you know, the pure kutch, you know.
[02:34.000 --> 02:36.640]  And that is the original SFV.
[02:37.520 --> 02:42.640]  It was just a pain in the ass to grow.
[02:43.280 --> 02:46.800]  It was like an ivy plant. It went everywhere.
[02:46.800 --> 02:47.760]  You know, it was just...
[02:48.720 --> 02:55.280]  Compared to like your Northern California indica plants that were nice and uniform and bushy and,
[02:55.920 --> 02:57.760]  you know, grew up like this.
[02:57.760 --> 03:00.800]  This thing, you switched it into flower.
[03:00.800 --> 03:04.960]  Its initial stretch could be as much as two or three feet.
[03:05.600 --> 03:18.000]  In 11, 12, 14 days, maintaining a light height on those was just like, wow, you know, super hard.
[03:18.000 --> 03:24.560]  You know, and your bud structure was nowhere as close together as the indica out of Northern
[03:24.560 --> 03:25.680]  California.
[03:25.680 --> 03:32.240]  You know, it would be like a bud and then a blank spot for eight or nine inches and another bud.
[03:32.240 --> 03:36.720]  And then it was like an ivy plant just going everywhere.
[03:36.720 --> 03:43.120]  So getting that plant to respond properly and get a tight bud structure was just really,
[03:43.120 --> 03:45.520]  really a tough, tough play.
[03:46.240 --> 03:46.960]  It still is.
[03:48.320 --> 03:48.720]  Oh yeah.
[03:49.520 --> 03:50.000]  Oh yeah.
[03:50.000 --> 03:50.960]  What is your farm called?
[03:50.960 --> 03:57.120]  You know, so Mr. Nice Guy LLC is our farm in Santa Barbara.
[03:57.680 --> 03:58.400]  It's licensed.
[03:58.400 --> 03:59.440]  From Half Baked?
[03:59.440 --> 03:59.680]  Yep.
[04:02.640 --> 04:04.800]  Dave Chappelle is a brand ambassador.
[04:04.800 --> 04:05.840]  Exactly.
[04:05.840 --> 04:06.960]  Exactly.
[04:06.960 --> 04:07.920]  Yeah.
