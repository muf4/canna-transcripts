[00:00.000 --> 00:03.840]  Wait, what's... talk to me about your...
[00:03.840 --> 00:05.440]  because you said you have banjos,
[00:05.440 --> 00:07.560]  and so what's like your guitar collection?
[00:10.160 --> 00:14.800]  I mean, I can give you the whole rundown of the whole story
[00:14.800 --> 00:18.440]  if you all want, but it's pretty much anything you can imagine, brother.
[00:18.440 --> 00:21.520]  I mean, if you think of the most priceless amplifier on earth,
[00:21.880 --> 00:23.440]  I probably fucking got it around here.
[00:25.640 --> 00:28.160]  I mean, it's crazy, dude, what I found out there.
[00:29.000 --> 00:30.240]  I mean, I've got a lot of great stuff.
[00:30.240 --> 00:33.840]  I've got a 1953 Supro 5-watt Champ.
[00:34.080 --> 00:35.240]  It's a Champ copy.
[00:35.240 --> 00:39.120]  But anyways, man, it's got all the original speakers, original tubes, everything.
[00:39.120 --> 00:41.560]  The only thing that's been replaced has been the power capacitors
[00:41.560 --> 00:43.560]  because I did that, you know, they dry out.
[00:43.560 --> 00:45.440]  Man, original speaker.
[00:45.440 --> 00:47.800]  Oh, man, I got so much stuff.
[00:47.800 --> 00:51.200]  I got an amp back here I built out of trash for my brother, Max.
[00:51.840 --> 00:53.120]  He's a Redditor, too.
[00:53.120 --> 00:55.480]  Anyway. Oh, shit.
[00:55.480 --> 00:57.480]  Don't be like, oh,
[00:58.280 --> 01:00.560]  yeah, don't fucking send that out, Pete.
[01:02.000 --> 01:03.440]  All right. Well, we're we're.
[01:03.440 --> 01:05.440]  Yeah, so we're going live now.
[01:05.440 --> 01:07.760]  But what did I say?
[01:07.760 --> 01:10.480]  So what? What was that?
[01:10.480 --> 01:12.480]  Can I spin a record and roll a joint?
[01:12.480 --> 01:15.640]  Of course. I'm going to smoke some weed myself.
[01:16.160 --> 01:21.160]  OK, well, I mean, you know, like when I don't want to interrupt talking,
[01:21.200 --> 01:23.280]  I don't know how to describe what I'm trying to say, brother.
[01:23.280 --> 01:25.480]  I just want to sit here and roll some weed.
[01:25.680 --> 01:27.560]  Yes. Yes. Go for it.
[01:27.560 --> 01:29.760]  Smoke some weed.
[01:29.880 --> 01:33.440]  But I would I would love for you to start the feed just any time you want, buddy.
[01:33.440 --> 01:34.560]  I want to.
[01:34.560 --> 01:37.040]  I literally just started it.
[01:37.040 --> 01:42.320]  So so that that's why I'm asking about your like what's the guitar you have?
[01:42.320 --> 01:45.120]  Like what's your go to guitar that you like to play on?
[01:46.720 --> 01:48.000]  Let's see, man.
[01:48.000 --> 01:49.760]  You know, it's really it's a utility thing.
[01:49.760 --> 01:51.240]  I don't have one in particular.
[01:51.240 --> 01:54.240]  I have one. I have ones that are like special to me, sentimentally.
[01:54.880 --> 01:57.400]  Really? I have like this is the one I'm going to play tonight.
[01:57.440 --> 01:59.200]  It's a fifty dollar guitar, man.
[01:59.200 --> 02:01.440]  Or I mean, if that, you know,
[02:03.200 --> 02:06.600]  I find what I like and it works and I can beat this one up in the garage.
[02:06.600 --> 02:12.640]  Really? He my my nicer ones are much nicer, man, brother.
[02:12.800 --> 02:14.080]  Oh, no, we weren't.
[02:14.080 --> 02:15.480]  Were we broadcasting?
[02:15.480 --> 02:17.480]  When did we start broadcasting?
[02:17.480 --> 02:18.800]  Are we good?
[02:18.800 --> 02:21.040]  About about a minute ago.
[02:21.040 --> 02:22.960]  All right, we're good. I get it.
[02:22.960 --> 02:23.800]  You got to let me know.
[02:23.800 --> 02:26.360]  We do that. I lose mouth now.
[02:26.360 --> 02:31.320]  Like like a damn hot, like a black and tan go down, son.
[02:31.360 --> 02:32.720]  All right, let's do this.
[02:32.720 --> 02:35.200]  Let's spin some fucking records, huh? All right.
[02:37.120 --> 02:38.480]  Hey, I got a good song, man.
[02:38.480 --> 02:42.040]  This is by Scott H. Byron, a very small man.
[02:42.080 --> 02:43.760]  I'm sick of saying that shit.
[02:43.760 --> 02:45.000]  Look here.
[02:45.240 --> 02:47.360]  He is famous as he should be, boys.
[02:47.440 --> 02:49.320]  That's all there is to it.
[02:54.590 --> 02:57.150]  We're getting the move right here, Pete.
[02:57.150 --> 03:00.990]  Now, what what what side you have, like some techniques or like what?
[03:00.990 --> 03:02.670]  What's your what's your record player?
[03:05.070 --> 03:07.550]  Forty dollars from the Amazon, baby.
[03:08.030 --> 03:10.750]  I'll leave it back. You know me
[03:10.750 --> 03:13.590]  light on energy consumption, honestly.
[03:13.590 --> 03:15.990]  And my two boys are hard on it, buddy.
[03:15.990 --> 03:18.110]  Now, can you play along with this?
[03:20.550 --> 03:21.830]  Can you even hear this?
[03:21.870 --> 03:22.590]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:22.590 --> 03:24.750]  Now I can definitely hear it.
[03:24.750 --> 03:26.750]  Just listen. Just listen, Pete.
[03:26.750 --> 03:28.590]  I'll get with the crime.
[03:28.590 --> 03:33.670]  Every time you turn your radio on, bad news mostly down here.
[03:33.670 --> 03:36.870]  The white race, the black race, the black race.
[03:36.870 --> 03:38.190]  He's the one.
[03:38.190 --> 03:40.790]  Yeah, you're to put your race down.
[03:40.790 --> 03:42.590]  People walking the gospel life.
[03:42.590 --> 03:45.230]  So the angels are saying, I mean,
[03:45.470 --> 03:47.150]  ain't it a shame?
[03:47.990 --> 03:49.590]  Ain't it a shame?
[03:49.790 --> 03:52.990]  We're going to lose all the viewers for you here.
[03:52.990 --> 03:54.990]  Well, I'm in.
[03:55.750 --> 03:57.670]  The people
[04:01.150 --> 04:04.830]  who feel the sorts of zero sharp
[04:05.630 --> 04:10.270]  has a deal we can play for.
[04:10.950 --> 04:11.910]  We're going to lose.
[04:11.910 --> 04:15.230]  You named it Shane.
[04:16.350 --> 04:17.470]  Oh, is this
[04:17.470 --> 04:19.230]  a shame?
[04:20.030 --> 04:22.350]  Who is this Bouron?
[04:22.350 --> 04:23.350]  a spiral.
[04:23.350 --> 04:24.350]  Can I flip my camera?
[04:24.350 --> 04:25.350]  Yeah.
[04:25.350 --> 04:45.650]  Well, why doesn't she answer?
[04:45.650 --> 04:51.650]  I'm gonna tell you, you don't get right with God, you don't know who to tell.
[04:51.650 --> 05:01.650]  Ain't it the same, ain't it the same, ain't it the same, the way the people do?
[05:01.650 --> 05:06.650]  People are quitting the treasure, some say God is dead.
[05:06.650 --> 05:11.650]  My God cannot die, don't the people know how that is?
[05:11.650 --> 05:16.650]  You talk about fighting and killing, you shouldn't be thinking of such.
[05:16.650 --> 05:21.650]  You got the whole world living in fear of you because you're killing so much.
[05:21.650 --> 05:30.650]  Ain't it the same, ain't it the same, ain't it the same, the way the people do?
[05:30.650 --> 05:36.650]  Ain't it the same, ain't it the same, ain't it the same, ain't it the same?
[05:36.650 --> 05:40.650]  Hey Pete, we can talk now buddy, I'm sorry man, I just had to get it going for a minute, you know?
[05:40.650 --> 05:46.650]  Yeah, and I like it. So what are you growing at home? What are you smoking on?
[05:46.650 --> 05:53.650]  Okay, hang on, let me get it. Man, for some reason I just can't hear Pete very good, buddy.
[05:53.650 --> 05:56.650]  Man, I want to hear you so good too, Pete. I do, I do.
[05:56.650 --> 05:59.650]  Yeah, I got lots of deep thoughts tonight.
[05:59.650 --> 06:02.650]  Oh shit, I'm sliding off my stool already, let's do this.
[06:02.650 --> 06:08.650]  Okay, let's do this. All right. I've got, okay, so right now I'm about to roll up that AK-48.
[06:08.650 --> 06:17.650]  It's a copy of, not a copy, I'm sorry. It's a take on AK-47, I think, from Nirvana Seeds.
[06:17.650 --> 06:24.650]  I got it as a cut from a buddy. Man, I tell you Pete, I've got pictures of the mothers of my plants
[06:24.650 --> 06:29.650]  that were grown in a tent and then my plants that was grown outside, man, it is just, it's unreal.
[06:29.650 --> 06:32.650]  It don't even make sense. It ain't even recognizable, brother.
[06:32.650 --> 06:35.650]  It don't make, I tell you, remember I sent you the first video and I said,
[06:35.650 --> 06:42.650]  okay, this is supposed to be Royal Gorilla, but I mean, seriously, considering my position on earth, right?
[06:42.650 --> 06:49.650]  On this big globe, baby. And then considering my soil and, you know, pathology and all those things.
[06:49.650 --> 06:56.650]  Man, there's no way that it's, ah, hey man, I'm just stoning in the garage, baby.
[06:57.650 --> 07:02.650]  Let me put some music a little bit higher in the background. I wish I could make you louder, Pete.
[07:02.650 --> 07:06.650]  Well, I don't want to be loud. I want to hear you play a song.
[07:06.650 --> 07:08.650]  Shit, let me roll a joint first, son.
[07:08.650 --> 07:09.650]  All right.
[07:09.650 --> 07:18.650]  Hey, oh yeah, let me do that. Hey, oh man. Oh man. You know what we should do?
[07:18.650 --> 07:24.650]  I'll do your tutorial on joint roll, man. I know there's somebody out there that don't know how to roll a goddang joint.
[07:24.650 --> 07:33.590]  Hang on. And you can't smoke weed through a bowl and taste it, man. I'm telling you.
[07:33.590 --> 07:39.590]  Hang on, time flies, baby. Hey, mama, I'm live. You want to go say hi?
[07:39.590 --> 07:46.590]  You sure? Hang on. Oh, I am. Drag it down the line.
[07:46.590 --> 07:53.950]  Oh, man, I love you, mama bear. One, two now.
[07:53.950 --> 07:58.950]  I have a little bit of noise in the background, man. I'm a scatterbrain, personally.
[07:58.950 --> 08:05.540]  I can't see nobody. Oh no, Pete.
[08:05.540 --> 08:19.760]  Oh. So I saw a bunch of, like you build guitars, right?
[08:19.760 --> 08:24.760]  Yes, sir. Okay. I can't see you no more, Pete.
[08:24.760 --> 08:34.280]  Man, I'll tell you what. I'm the worst dang como guy. Hang on, big dog.
[08:34.280 --> 08:38.280]  Hang on, let me see if I can see you. I can't see you. How do I see you?
[08:38.280 --> 08:42.280]  It's okay. Oh, man. No, I want to see you, Pete.
[08:42.280 --> 08:45.280]  I just saw three of us now. Holy shit. Here we go, boy.
[08:45.280 --> 08:49.280]  Oh my god, your mind is blown.
[08:49.280 --> 08:55.280]  It's almost like my son just showed me something on a video game and he's only nine.
[08:55.280 --> 08:59.280]  All right. I'll feature the two of you. How about that?
[08:59.280 --> 09:03.280]  All of us now. Oh, it's so much better, guys. Let me move this for you.
[09:03.280 --> 09:08.280]  You guys are all so beautiful, too, man. I'll tell you what.
[09:08.280 --> 09:10.280]  I know that comment was directed at me.
[09:10.280 --> 09:15.280]  Are you from California, too? Is everybody in California just like, is it like what everyone in Tennessee imagines?
[09:15.280 --> 09:18.280]  Is everybody just like, you know, walk around with makeup on and stuff?
[09:18.280 --> 09:24.280]  Yeah. It depends on where, but there are a lot of extremely beautiful people in L.A.
[09:24.280 --> 09:26.280]  It'll do a number on your confidence.
[09:26.280 --> 09:28.280]  Myself included.
[09:28.280 --> 09:30.280]  I couldn't even imagine.
[09:30.280 --> 09:39.280]  I remember, I think I was like, there's a section of the grocery store that has like keto, like a low sugar ice cream.
[09:39.280 --> 09:42.280]  Low sugar ice cream section in a grocery store.
[09:42.280 --> 09:45.280]  I've met a lot of models just like huddling near the fridge.
[09:45.280 --> 09:51.280]  It's an industry thing. But similarly, New York will destroy your confidence.
[09:51.280 --> 09:55.280]  So, New York. I listened to the last podcast on the left.
[09:55.280 --> 09:58.280]  I'm just going to drop like all kinds of crazy shit here tonight, y'all.
[09:58.280 --> 10:01.280]  Hey, rewind and write all these things down, man.
[10:01.280 --> 10:03.280]  There's a lot of great pop culture out there right now.
[10:03.280 --> 10:05.280]  Anyways, all right.
[10:05.280 --> 10:07.280]  So, Todd, I want to hear it.
[10:07.280 --> 10:09.280]  So, you got a lot of vinyl.
[10:09.280 --> 10:19.280]  I used to DJ a lot and I started with vinyl and just looking for obscure shit.
[10:19.280 --> 10:24.280]  What's in your record collection?
[10:24.280 --> 10:34.280]  I've got a bunch of records from the Fairbanks, Alaska, KSAU college radio station from the fucking 80s, dog.
[10:34.280 --> 10:36.280]  All the good stuff.
[10:36.280 --> 10:44.280]  Oh, man, I got a bunch of 80s shit you ain't never going to hear nowhere else.
[10:44.280 --> 10:47.280]  I think we need to hear some of that.
[10:47.280 --> 10:50.280]  I was going to start the show with it, but I was going to give my home.
[10:51.280 --> 10:54.280]  But man, Scott H. Byram is such a talented guy.
[10:54.280 --> 10:56.280]  I'm sure some people out there probably know.
[10:56.280 --> 10:58.280]  Yeah, talk about him.
[10:58.280 --> 10:59.280]  Dude, okay.
[10:59.280 --> 11:03.280]  You're from Tennessee. So, where is he from?
[11:03.280 --> 11:08.280]  Well, we're going to throw out from Tennessee pretty loosely here.
[11:08.280 --> 11:13.280]  I mean, man, I joined the army when I was 20, you know, and then I was just gone.
[11:13.280 --> 11:19.280]  So, I came back in January, boys.
[11:20.280 --> 11:26.280]  You know, I'm just now re-acclimatizing to all y'all.
[11:26.280 --> 11:30.280]  But, yeah, Scott H. Byram is from Austin.
[11:30.280 --> 11:32.280]  Well, he's from Texas.
[11:32.280 --> 11:36.280]  His lyrics, you know, he does a lot of talking blues stuff.
[11:36.280 --> 11:38.280]  And so, he talks a lot over the top of it.
[11:38.280 --> 11:41.280]  And there's a lot of interesting little facts in that.
[11:41.280 --> 11:43.280]  I don't know if you can hear me well or not.
[11:43.280 --> 11:45.280]  I'm like moving around.
[11:46.280 --> 11:51.280]  I'm trying to get myself into what we talked about, Pete.
[11:51.280 --> 11:53.280]  Man, you got to tell people these things.
[11:53.280 --> 11:55.280]  You look better in a frame when you're where Pete is, guys.
[11:55.280 --> 11:57.280]  That's just the bottom line.
[11:57.280 --> 11:58.280]  All right.
[11:58.280 --> 12:01.280]  Don't be trying to keep your secrets, Pete.
[12:01.280 --> 12:05.280]  I told everybody I had a banjo up next to my mic, so I got reverb.
[12:05.280 --> 12:07.280]  You know what I mean, guys?
[12:12.130 --> 12:14.130]  Can we see the banjo?
[12:14.130 --> 12:16.130]  Oh, yeah, of course.
[12:16.130 --> 12:18.130]  It's a steel sharpened steel, baby.
[12:18.130 --> 12:20.130]  Here you go.
[12:20.130 --> 12:22.130]  Here we go.
[12:22.130 --> 12:23.130]  See?
[12:23.130 --> 12:28.130]  See my $18 Wembley ready microphone for all you fine people.
[12:28.130 --> 12:30.130]  Man, it's a hanging one too, because I'm high class.
[12:30.130 --> 12:34.130]  I could go to LA really, I bet.
[12:34.130 --> 12:42.130]  So I had a gold tone electric banjo that my brother just told me that he sold.
[12:42.130 --> 12:44.130]  You play?
[12:44.130 --> 12:51.130]  I don't have any like my guitars or DJ equipment out here in LA.
[12:51.130 --> 12:52.530]  Pete, I love you so much.
[12:52.530 --> 12:54.130]  Pete, I got to do this to you, man.
[12:54.130 --> 12:56.130]  Now, when we talked today, you said,
[12:56.130 --> 12:58.730]  I've been trying to get all these musicians and they're like,
[12:58.730 --> 12:59.930]  oh, well, I'm not professional.
[12:59.930 --> 13:01.130]  I don't want to do it.
[13:01.130 --> 13:03.130]  Pete, you got to play banjo for us, dog.
[13:03.130 --> 13:03.930]  I'll give you one.
[13:03.930 --> 13:04.730]  I'll mail you one.
[13:04.730 --> 13:06.130]  Yeah.
[13:06.130 --> 13:10.130]  I'm more like, I'm more like, I'm more like,
[13:10.130 --> 13:12.130]  I'm more like, I'm more like,
[13:12.130 --> 13:16.130]  I'm more like a, uh,
[13:16.130 --> 13:18.130]  Well, it makes you better, Pete.
[13:18.130 --> 13:23.130]  Like, I would write and produce music and I'm more like,
[13:23.130 --> 13:25.130]  I would never get on a stage in front of people
[13:25.130 --> 13:30.130]  and play guitar or keyboard or anything, but like,
[13:30.130 --> 13:31.130]  Hey, me neither, dog.
[13:31.130 --> 13:36.130]  In Ableton, I could lay down a guitar track.
[13:36.130 --> 13:38.130]  Wait, did you say you could lay down a guitar track?
[13:38.130 --> 13:43.130]  Like, like in Ableton, like by myself with no one watching.
[13:43.130 --> 13:44.130]  Yes.
[13:44.130 --> 13:47.130]  Whoa, you got some music theory background there.
[13:47.130 --> 13:48.130]  What you got?
[13:48.130 --> 13:49.130]  What you got?
[13:49.130 --> 13:53.130]  No, not at all.
[13:53.130 --> 13:54.130]  Yeah.
[13:54.130 --> 13:56.130]  Someone said dueling banjo.
[13:56.130 --> 13:58.130]  Yeah, we can do dueling banjos.
[13:58.130 --> 14:00.130]  I can do dueling banjos for you later on, guys.
[14:00.130 --> 14:01.130]  Man, I'll burn you some banjos.
[14:01.130 --> 14:03.130]  Oh man, I love doing banjos.
[14:03.130 --> 14:04.130]  I do it on the guitar though.
[14:04.130 --> 14:06.130]  I do it like, well, here, I'll play it.
[14:06.130 --> 14:07.130]  While I'm smoking the joint, I'll play it.
[14:07.130 --> 14:13.130]  Well, so my, my like inspiration for the Goldtone was,
[14:13.130 --> 14:15.130]  I don't know if you know who the Jolly Boys are,
[14:15.130 --> 14:19.130]  but they're like a Jamaican,
[14:19.130 --> 14:23.130]  like the Jamaican version of Calypso music.
[14:23.130 --> 14:25.130]  And they're fucking awesome.
[14:25.130 --> 14:27.130]  I mean, they're, they're all like, you know,
[14:27.130 --> 14:30.130]  they're a bunch of 80 year old guys now.
[14:30.130 --> 14:32.130]  Yeah, so I was going to ask what, what era?
[14:33.130 --> 14:38.130]  Yeah, probably fifties into the sixties,
[14:38.130 --> 14:44.130]  kind of like just before Bob Marley, like the,
[14:44.130 --> 14:48.130]  I forget what you call the Jamaican version of Calypso, but anyway,
[14:48.130 --> 14:52.130]  like they, they, they had an album like 10 years ago,
[14:52.130 --> 14:56.130]  which was basically covers of like hit songs.
[14:56.130 --> 15:01.130]  Like, I mean, Rolling Stone songs and like the clash and,
[15:02.130 --> 15:03.130]  other stuff,
[15:03.130 --> 15:07.130]  but it's like them playing it and they're Jamaican Calypso style with an
[15:07.130 --> 15:13.130]  electric banjo. And I was like, this is the fucking baddest sound.
[15:13.130 --> 15:15.130]  This sounds amazing.
[15:15.130 --> 15:18.130]  I want to figure out how to make mine sound like a sitar,
[15:18.130 --> 15:20.130]  because I've got a song that I wrote. That's like, it's got,
[15:20.130 --> 15:24.130]  it's like a Hindu country song. You know how I do. And then,
[15:25.130 --> 15:28.130]  it's got a part in it where I sing Arabic, but I want to have like a,
[15:28.130 --> 15:32.130]  you know what I'm talking about? Like a sitar type effect going on,
[15:32.130 --> 15:36.130]  like in, oh man, ooh, Steve Miller band, you know,
[15:36.130 --> 15:38.130]  or Venus and furs or something like that.
[15:39.130 --> 15:41.130]  Some Beatles, George Harrison.
[15:42.130 --> 15:45.130]  Oh man. I've got Her Majesty's Satanic Request over there, dude.
[15:45.130 --> 15:48.130]  It's like as psychedelic as it gets. Oh man.
[15:51.130 --> 15:53.130]  That's a good one. Oh, here's the tutorial guys.
[15:53.130 --> 15:56.130]  You put your weed in a paper there like that. See,
[15:56.130 --> 15:58.130]  make sure you got good weed that you grew in your garden.
[15:58.130 --> 16:02.130]  Now that sticks to the paper so you can turn it upside down like a damn
[16:02.130 --> 16:03.130]  blizzard. All right.
[16:06.130 --> 16:10.130]  And then if everything is correct, honestly, if you,
[16:10.130 --> 16:15.130]  you see how I did the end there, I do like a, and then roll it up.
[16:15.130 --> 16:18.130]  I'm sure everybody does it guys. I don't know how to roll a joint.
[16:18.130 --> 16:22.130]  Honestly. I just figured it out. You know, my video is spotlighted.
[16:22.130 --> 16:23.130]  Oh, thank you.
[16:24.130 --> 16:25.130]  I mean, all right.
[16:25.130 --> 16:29.130]  That means you're trying to show everyone something. So right.
[16:30.130 --> 16:33.130]  Okay. So I'm trying to figure out the way to describe that moves yet.
[16:33.130 --> 16:35.130]  You know, if you roll joints, you know what I'm talking about?
[16:35.130 --> 16:37.130]  It's the, it's the tuck buddy. You got it.
[16:37.130 --> 16:39.130]  This is why they call these a crutch I think,
[16:39.130 --> 16:43.130]  because you can stick your paper underneath that mug right there and hold it.
[16:43.130 --> 16:46.130]  See, and then you got it. And you know what else you can do guys?
[16:46.130 --> 16:50.130]  Look at here. If you do this empty, you can actually make a cone tip.
[16:50.130 --> 16:53.130]  So easy. I'll make one for you in a second. And then you can stuff it.
[16:53.130 --> 16:55.130]  If you ain't, if you ain't keen on rolling, you know,
[16:55.130 --> 17:00.130]  it's almost as good as a roll joint, but not quite. All right. Anyways.
[17:00.130 --> 17:01.130]  So then you lick it boys. All right.
[17:04.130 --> 17:06.130]  And then you do that little joint. Well,
[17:06.130 --> 17:09.130]  that's about the ugliest one of course on the string,
[17:11.130 --> 17:15.130]  but it works. Right. All right. So that's all that matters.
[17:16.130 --> 17:19.130]  Hey man, I'm a craftsman. Hey, who is the guy with the hair man?
[17:19.130 --> 17:21.130]  And he's like, he's over the top, but I love him to death.
[17:21.130 --> 17:26.130]  Regenerative Canada, this guy, blonde hair. He looks like, oh man.
[17:26.130 --> 17:27.130]  Jesus is all I can think.
[17:30.130 --> 17:36.130]  No, it's not Josh, but why am I, Jesse Dodd?
[17:37.130 --> 17:39.130]  Dude, I want to smoke with that guy so bad.
[17:39.130 --> 17:42.130]  Well, we can he's a,
[17:44.130 --> 17:47.130]  is Jesse in Oregon or Washington? You're, you're in Washington.
[17:48.130 --> 17:51.130]  I'm in Washington. Yeah. Unfortunately, dude. Hey. Yeah, you're right. Yeah.
[17:51.130 --> 17:56.130]  Jesse's in Oregon. Josh is in Washington, but yeah,
[17:56.130 --> 18:00.130]  we will all smoke some weed together.
[18:03.130 --> 18:06.130]  Yeah. And, and, and, you know, especially if I could,
[18:06.130 --> 18:09.130]  man, if I have, if there was someone I could trust, you know, man,
[18:09.130 --> 18:10.130]  it sucks, dude.
[18:10.130 --> 18:15.130]  It sucks that weed has become so God dang monetized around him that we have
[18:15.130 --> 18:16.130]  to worry.
[18:16.130 --> 18:20.130]  I have to worry about the fact that I got a damn, my Skywalker OG still up.
[18:20.130 --> 18:23.130]  You know what I'm talking about, man? It's just sad. So sad.
[18:23.130 --> 18:25.130]  If they came to my house and knocked on the door,
[18:25.130 --> 18:28.130]  I'd give them a God damn ounce to try and trim.
[18:31.130 --> 18:32.130]  Man.
[18:32.130 --> 18:35.130]  Well, what, what are you worried about? So in,
[18:36.130 --> 18:39.130]  I want people to see my garden, man. I want, I want,
[18:39.130 --> 18:43.130]  I want somebody from Washington to come and observe what I'm observing and
[18:43.130 --> 18:45.130]  tell me if I'm crazy or not, you know,
[18:48.130 --> 18:52.130]  Well, you're, you're basically growing in the ground in your backyard,
[18:52.130 --> 18:53.130]  right?
[18:53.130 --> 18:58.130]  Yep. No water. No. Well, okay. So was a lot to it, but as of October,
[18:58.130 --> 19:02.130]  I mean, April, I'm sorry, fuck August 1st, I have not watered it.
[19:02.130 --> 19:04.130]  I never really put any nutrients on there.
[19:04.130 --> 19:07.130]  My, the guy that gave me the clones puts them in there.
[19:07.130 --> 19:11.130]  You know, like just like that little blue pack from miracle grow baby.
[19:11.130 --> 19:14.130]  That's a good stuff. All right. And then, but that was it.
[19:14.130 --> 19:18.130]  And man, I tell you what, son, Hey, what'd I tell you earlier, Pete,
[19:18.130 --> 19:21.130]  I'm going to say it on your stream. I was afraid I wouldn't say it.
[19:21.130 --> 19:24.130]  All right. Look, if you grow weed from my backyard,
[19:24.130 --> 19:27.130]  Please do yourself a favor, go outside, take a seed, just any shit seed,
[19:27.130 --> 19:30.130]  man, put it in the ground next March. Right.
[19:30.130 --> 19:33.130]  And just walk away, man. Have, have the discipline to walk away.
[19:33.130 --> 19:35.130]  Make sure that what nature is doing.
[19:35.130 --> 19:39.130]  Isn't better than what you're doing by wasting energy and resources and
[19:39.130 --> 19:41.130]  pollution and all these other things, man.
[19:41.130 --> 19:43.130]  That's all I'm asking to ask. You know what I'm saying?
[19:43.130 --> 19:44.130]  It's a simple test, man.
[19:44.130 --> 19:46.130]  On your little piece of earth, you know,
[19:46.130 --> 19:47.130]  you're going to have to do it.
[19:47.130 --> 19:48.130]  You're going to have to do it.
[19:48.130 --> 19:49.130]  You're going to have to do it.
[19:49.130 --> 19:50.130]  You're going to have to do it.
[19:50.130 --> 19:51.130]  You're going to have to do it.
[19:51.130 --> 19:53.130]  You know what I'm saying? It's a simple test, man.
[19:53.130 --> 19:55.130]  On your little piece of earth. That's all you got to do.
[19:55.130 --> 19:59.130]  One little test is a bag seed, man. You know, anyways,
[20:04.130 --> 20:05.130]  I'm done.
[20:06.130 --> 20:08.130]  And how's the Skywalker?
[20:09.130 --> 20:11.130]  Oh man. It's so healthy.
[20:13.130 --> 20:16.130]  It's like, uh, so that's another thing too.
[20:16.130 --> 20:20.130]  All the plants that I got mine from, they ain't green no more. You know,
[20:20.130 --> 20:23.130]  they're like purple and yellow and red and beautiful colors.
[20:23.130 --> 20:27.130]  I mean, ornamentally speaking, cannabis, beautiful, you know, but I mean,
[20:27.130 --> 20:29.130]  Hey guys, let's be real here.
[20:29.130 --> 20:34.130]  I replaced quite a few pharmaceuticals with medicinal cannabis, you know,
[20:34.130 --> 20:36.130]  like I got to have good stuff.
[20:38.130 --> 20:42.130]  I hate to say it like that, but you know, I need to hit some numbers here.
[20:44.130 --> 20:45.130]  Anyways.
[20:46.130 --> 20:49.130]  So you, you were, you were in the army.
[20:50.130 --> 20:51.130]  Yes, sir.
[20:51.130 --> 20:55.130]  And, and you were, so you're, you have a math background, right?
[20:56.130 --> 20:59.130]  Oh man. I ain't got no dang background. I pay attention.
[21:00.130 --> 21:04.130]  Well, I, you like math. How about that? You like numbers?
[21:05.130 --> 21:08.130]  Well, I like life and life is math, man.
[21:10.130 --> 21:13.130]  You guys ain't caught on yet, but I'm telling you, man, mathematicians,
[21:13.130 --> 21:17.130]  oh man, they have beautiful minds and I ain't even a mathematician.
[21:17.130 --> 21:20.130]  Oh man. I'm telling you that's where it's all at, man. That's the beauty.
[21:20.130 --> 21:24.130]  You know what it is? You know what it is, Pete? Man.
[21:24.130 --> 21:29.130]  I can explain it perfectly. It's the ever search for the fucking curve, man.
[21:30.130 --> 21:34.130]  If you, so, all right. If you look at something in nature, right, it's curved.
[21:34.130 --> 21:36.130]  They ain't nothing straight in nature. Nothing.
[21:38.130 --> 21:41.130]  Hey, keep that in mind, boys and girls. Anyways.
[21:41.130 --> 21:46.130]  So they know this straight nature, right? But everything's curved, man.
[21:46.130 --> 21:48.130]  And it's all just a, a man.
[21:48.130 --> 21:51.130]  If you've ever seen that cartoon from packing grade school,
[21:51.130 --> 21:56.130]  phantasm or whatever it was called, where they did the math tricks with the man,
[21:56.130 --> 21:58.130]  somebody is going to comment. They know what I'm talking about.
[21:58.130 --> 22:03.130]  I hope God bless. Anyways, we watched it in high school, man. It's good.
[22:03.130 --> 22:06.130]  It shows you how math works with music, basically.
[22:06.130 --> 22:09.130]  But okay. So this is where it becomes very important.
[22:09.130 --> 22:13.130]  So by the everything's away, we know that from particle theory. Okay.
[22:13.130 --> 22:15.130]  And then we know from, I mean,
[22:15.130 --> 22:18.130]  the fact that we've explored that digital data and logic,
[22:18.130 --> 22:21.130]  we know that everything else is just a one and a zero homie.
[22:21.130 --> 22:25.130]  So basically if it's binary, it ain't natural.
[22:25.130 --> 22:27.130]  And it's not natural. It's not natural.
[22:27.130 --> 22:29.130]  It's not natural. It's not natural.
[22:29.130 --> 22:31.130]  It's not natural. It's not natural.
[22:31.130 --> 22:33.130]  It's not natural. It's not natural.
[22:33.130 --> 22:36.130]  If it's binary, it ain't natural, man.
[22:36.130 --> 22:42.130]  And that lesson can go so fucking far in your life and make you so happy.
[22:42.130 --> 22:46.130]  Just accept it, brother. You know what I'm saying? Oh man. It's the curve dog.
[22:46.130 --> 22:47.130]  It's the curve.
[22:55.850 --> 22:59.850]  So where, where do you see Matt? Like I want to stay on math. So where,
[22:59.850 --> 23:03.850]  so in the army kind of what kind of math stuff were you doing?
[23:03.850 --> 23:05.850]  And then like, and like the rest of your life,
[23:05.850 --> 23:08.850]  where are you looking at things mathematically?
[23:10.850 --> 23:14.850]  Like, what, what, what was the, oh fuck.
[23:14.850 --> 23:18.850]  It's not a something mind. What, what, what was the movie Russell Crowe?
[23:19.850 --> 23:21.850]  Beautiful mind. Beautiful mind. Right.
[23:21.850 --> 23:24.850]  I stole it from me because I already said beautiful mind earlier. Hey,
[23:24.850 --> 23:26.850]  there's a three-year-old he's naked. Hang on.
[23:29.850 --> 23:30.850]  Hey, he's also got your
[23:31.850 --> 23:33.850]  I don't know how to, I don't know how to mute it. Hey, I love you.
[23:36.850 --> 23:38.850]  Oh man. We get up to all kinds of shenanigans out here.
[23:38.850 --> 23:44.510]  Burning incense in the garage now. All right. Good times.
[23:45.510 --> 23:46.510]  Naked babies.
[23:48.510 --> 23:51.510]  Hey, hey, look here. We believe in my house.
[23:51.510 --> 23:54.510]  We have, we embraced the medical terminology of things.
[23:54.510 --> 23:57.510]  You know what I'm saying, man? You gotta be realistic with kids.
[23:57.510 --> 24:00.510]  It's very penal around the house. I got two boys. It's crazy.
[24:01.510 --> 24:04.510]  Them boys are horrible. Horrible. Hey, you know what, man?
[24:04.510 --> 24:06.510]  We can learn a lot by watching younger men.
[24:08.510 --> 24:11.510]  I feel like a lot of the time when I look at nations,
[24:11.510 --> 24:17.160]  I feel like it's like a playground and it's like children and you can learn a
[24:17.160 --> 24:20.160]  lot about the way like countries interact with one another,
[24:20.160 --> 24:21.160]  just like the way we're like,
[24:21.160 --> 24:24.160]  we're like the world is like a playground and we're like,
[24:24.160 --> 24:26.160]  we're like the world is like a playground.
[24:26.160 --> 24:30.160]  About the way like countries interact with one another just by watching kids.
[24:33.500 --> 24:36.500]  You ain't kidding, man. And you know, that's okay, Pete.
[24:36.500 --> 24:40.500]  That's a perfect example, man. We've had human nature. Oh man.
[24:40.500 --> 24:43.500]  Y'all should check out a Ram a damn.
[24:44.500 --> 24:47.500]  It's some physics theory thing they're working on, but it's a really good one.
[24:47.500 --> 24:49.500]  It's the idea that basically there's certain rules in the universe and that
[24:49.500 --> 24:51.500]  these three or four rules, let's say very simple rules,
[24:51.500 --> 24:54.500]  like positive, abstract and negative, you know,
[24:54.500 --> 24:57.500]  that those rules, if they're propagated properly in the universe,
[24:57.500 --> 25:00.500]  upon the big bang, right? Because we had basically everything went out,
[25:00.500 --> 25:03.500]  came back in. But what the idea is that when everything came out,
[25:03.500 --> 25:06.500]  there was a pause, not a pause, but there was a singularity, right?
[25:06.500 --> 25:10.500]  So there was, there was an imbalance. Ha, what did I tell you? Right.
[25:10.500 --> 25:13.500]  In nature, there's no binary guys. All right. So,
[25:16.500 --> 25:19.500]  man, I was, I was cracking myself up. Should I play a song yet?
[25:20.500 --> 25:22.500]  Sure. Now I'm going to play a song.
[25:23.500 --> 25:27.500]  Sure. Now I, I, I want to hear you play the guitar. You, you played it.
[25:27.500 --> 25:32.500]  You, you did your test run. Huh? I want,
[25:32.500 --> 25:36.500]  I want to rock out to some tunes. Oh yeah, man. Let's do it, man.
[25:36.500 --> 25:39.500]  I'm feeling really comfortable now. See this one I'm talking about, man.
[25:39.500 --> 25:42.500]  It just brings everybody together. It's great. It's great stuff.
[25:45.500 --> 25:46.500]  Hey, look,
[25:47.500 --> 25:52.500]  my first argument when I got out of the army with myself was why don't we give
[25:52.500 --> 25:55.500]  this to everybody in the army, you know, make them healthy. Okay.
[25:55.500 --> 25:59.500]  I haven't covered that yet, dude. I lost like 50 pounds when I got out of the army.
[25:59.500 --> 26:03.500]  I like equilibrium. It was weird. And it was just,
[26:03.500 --> 26:06.500]  and all I was doing was just running around, honestly, you know,
[26:07.500 --> 26:11.500]  being 20 or 19 right before I joined the army, I guess.
[26:11.500 --> 26:13.500]  What, what, what year did you get out?
[26:15.500 --> 26:18.500]  This year, brother. Oh shit. Okay. I didn't, you didn't tell me that.
[26:19.500 --> 26:22.500]  I'm fresh out, man. Fresh out. Oh God. I, Hey,
[26:22.500 --> 26:24.500]  we'll talk more about it in private. All right.
[26:27.500 --> 26:28.500]  It's a little hectic on round here.
[26:32.500 --> 26:35.500]  Hey, what song do you want to hear? Did you, Hey, look,
[26:35.500 --> 26:37.500]  if you didn't listen to that stream, I do not blame you, brother.
[26:37.500 --> 26:39.500]  I'm not going to blame you. I'm not going to blame you.
[26:39.500 --> 26:41.500]  If you didn't listen to that stream, I do not blame you, brother.
[26:41.500 --> 26:45.500]  I, I, so one, I want to go like in an old,
[26:45.500 --> 26:50.500]  so I'm a big fan of like old school,
[26:50.500 --> 26:53.500]  like not modern country where like,
[26:53.500 --> 26:57.500]  it's like country pop where everybody wears like the cowboy hat and like the
[26:57.500 --> 27:01.500]  tight jeans and the I I'm like Johnny cash.
[27:01.500 --> 27:06.500]  And then like Robert Johnson, like, like old school country,
[27:06.500 --> 27:10.500]  old school blues. Like you're from Tennessee. Like you listen to,
[27:10.500 --> 27:12.500]  you're going to get some of that then. Do you,
[27:13.500 --> 27:16.500]  do you listen to culture wall, man? I'm sure you do.
[27:16.500 --> 27:21.500]  Everybody does on it on YouTube. At least it seems seen as brewery sessions.
[27:21.500 --> 27:24.500]  Anyway, let's hear it. Let's let's no, no, no. I don't,
[27:24.500 --> 27:28.500]  I don't cover that man. I don't cover that man. How easy, easy.
[27:29.500 --> 27:33.500]  When you, if you've ever watched him, you know why? Hey, come on. Let me,
[27:33.500 --> 27:35.500]  you know what? Since I'm going to do a song, Oh man,
[27:35.500 --> 27:40.500]  this is really going to put the pressure on Pete. I'm loving this brother.
[27:40.500 --> 27:43.500]  This is such good therapy guys. Hey, let me tell you something first,
[27:43.500 --> 27:48.500]  before I do this, because I want, I want you to study my, my, my,
[27:48.500 --> 27:53.500]  my body emotions. And I want you guys to feel what I'm feeling.
[27:53.500 --> 27:58.500]  I really do, man, dude. I have to describe it to you, man. Oh God.
[27:58.500 --> 28:00.500]  Look at here. When I, in 2006,
[28:00.500 --> 28:03.500]  I was in a Tel Afar Iraq and I had this guy,
[28:03.500 --> 28:07.500]  Chet. Chet, I said your name. Anyway. All right.
[28:07.500 --> 28:12.500]  So Chet's my guru now. Chet used to work for me though. It's funny.
[28:12.500 --> 28:15.500]  All right. So I told Chet, get out of the army, man.
[28:15.500 --> 28:19.500]  This ain't the place for you, dog. He lives down in Portland now.
[28:19.500 --> 28:22.500]  He's, he's like a, you know, a software developer or something.
[28:22.500 --> 28:25.500]  Anyways, but he's, you know, a, a, a,
[28:25.500 --> 28:28.500]  a very experienced man, honestly, in the civilian world.
[28:28.500 --> 28:31.500]  And I trusted him. And when I got out of the army, I was like, man,
[28:31.500 --> 28:35.500]  I didn't talk to somebody, dog. So he comes up here, you know,
[28:35.500 --> 28:40.500]  toting all kinds of, man, I got to talk to you in private.
[28:40.500 --> 28:44.500]  We had good times, man. Oh man, such good times, such good times, Pete.
[28:44.500 --> 28:48.500]  And dude, let me tell you the why I called him, man.
[28:48.500 --> 28:51.500]  I just love Chet to death though. God bless.
[28:51.500 --> 28:56.500]  All right. So, all right. So the reason why I called him was because in 2005,
[28:56.500 --> 28:59.500]  I taught Chet how to play guitar. I taught him one.
[28:59.500 --> 29:02.500]  I don't even think I taught it to him. I think he learned it himself.
[29:02.500 --> 29:05.500]  I basically just maybe made a guitar, but I don't even know.
[29:05.500 --> 29:08.500]  Maybe I didn't have nothing to do with it. Hey, here's some narcissism.
[29:08.500 --> 29:11.500]  I play guitar. I had something to do with you playing guitar. Anyways.
[29:11.500 --> 29:15.500]  All right. All right. So Chet, this, Hey, this is the best part.
[29:15.500 --> 29:18.500]  Chet's like, I'm going to play guitar. I'm going to play guitar.
[29:18.500 --> 29:21.500]  All right. So Chet, this, Hey, this is the best part guys.
[29:21.500 --> 29:24.500]  You're going to get to hear both sides of the argument all at once.
[29:24.500 --> 29:28.500]  So, so Chet brings me this, you know, like he's,
[29:28.500 --> 29:30.500]  he's learned how to play guitar and I'm kind of coaching him, whatever.
[29:30.500 --> 29:36.500]  Dude, a week later, Chet's playing the opening song down in the damn boxing ring.
[29:36.500 --> 29:40.500]  Cause dude in Iraq, boys, we get up to some,
[29:40.500 --> 29:44.500]  Hey, we have fun over there sometimes, you know,
[29:44.500 --> 29:46.500]  it ain't no different than anywhere else. You know,
[29:46.500 --> 29:50.500]  you get a bunch of dudes together, I guess we do stupid shit.
[29:50.500 --> 29:54.500]  That's the bottom line hitting each other. Stupid guys. Hey, newsflash.
[29:54.500 --> 29:58.500]  Don't do it. It hurts.
[29:58.500 --> 30:03.500]  Anyways, man, I feel like I'm talking to my three year old feet.
[30:03.500 --> 30:10.500]  All right. All right. So, Hey man, Hey,
[30:10.500 --> 30:12.500]  let me get hit enough for everybody. I've been hitting up for everybody.
[30:13.500 --> 30:18.500]  Gosh, you ain't got to get hit no more. All right.
[30:18.500 --> 30:23.500]  Oh man. You'll get me teary eyed laughing, laughing, laughing at the state of things.
[30:23.500 --> 30:27.500]  All right. So bottom line,
[30:27.500 --> 30:29.500]  Chet's down there a week after he learned how to play guitar,
[30:29.500 --> 30:31.500]  but I'm probably screaming at the phone right now.
[30:31.500 --> 30:35.500]  I'm supposed to wear hearing aids and I don't, Hey, I'm a rebel.
[30:35.500 --> 30:39.500]  So my wife loves it.
[30:40.500 --> 30:45.500]  Love her. All right. So Chet, Chet man,
[30:45.500 --> 30:49.500]  like cold, he learned the national anthem. You know, the Jimi Hendrix.
[30:53.500 --> 30:56.500]  That's pretty much the basis of what the man learned.
[30:56.500 --> 30:59.500]  And then he went out on stage, man, in front of everybody on that little,
[30:59.500 --> 31:00.500]  that little post.
[31:03.500 --> 31:05.500]  I can't find my phone charger.
[31:06.500 --> 31:09.500]  Got to find a phone charger, boys. There's important things out there.
[31:09.500 --> 31:12.500]  I'm just going to let you know, Pete, take over for a second, buddy.
[31:12.500 --> 31:15.500]  All right. We'll weigh in while we look for the phone charger.
[31:15.500 --> 31:20.500]  All right. Mia, what are you dabbing away on right now?
[31:20.500 --> 31:23.500]  Oh, I was just on Twitter,
[31:23.500 --> 31:27.500]  posting the link to the interview we were doing and just,
[31:27.500 --> 31:30.500]  just catching up on stuff. So,
[31:30.500 --> 31:34.500]  and tagging Normal and David Kim's campaign.
[31:34.500 --> 31:38.500]  I'm dabbing on OG Kush tonight. I'm pretty excited. This is my,
[31:38.500 --> 31:40.500]  one of my favorite consistencies,
[31:41.500 --> 31:46.500]  but basically this amount of chirpiness and this amount of diamond is it's
[31:46.500 --> 31:50.500]  like, it's juicy and strong. It's two good things.
[31:50.500 --> 31:53.500]  And I'll be loading that into the Rio presently,
[31:53.500 --> 31:57.500]  but I'm just catching up on the shout out we got on Twitter and everything
[31:57.500 --> 32:00.500]  for our previous, previous show.
[32:01.500 --> 32:04.500]  And I'm really excited to hear some music.
[32:04.500 --> 32:08.500]  I think that live music is one of the things I've been missing most amid these
[32:08.500 --> 32:12.500]  times. And yeah, like I used to, I go, we'll go to like,
[32:12.500 --> 32:16.500]  life is beautiful and everything every year and watching live music online has
[32:16.500 --> 32:19.500]  kind of been a surrogate for, for that kind of experience.
[32:19.500 --> 32:21.500]  So it'll be good.
[32:21.500 --> 32:26.500]  Yeah. We, we are, we are slowly getting to the point where John,
[32:26.500 --> 32:30.500]  where John rocks us out, but he, he's an amazing musician and
[32:33.500 --> 32:36.500]  we're, we're slow. We're inching our way to that point.
[32:36.500 --> 32:40.500]  But I want to hear some, some eclectic music tonight.
[32:40.500 --> 32:41.500]  So some that's why I'm,
[32:42.500 --> 32:47.500]  I wanted him to start with the old school country hillbilly
[32:48.500 --> 32:49.500]  music.
[32:50.500 --> 32:54.500]  Honestly, I, I don't know if I'm going to be able to do it.
[32:54.500 --> 32:58.500]  I, I, I don't know much about country music,
[32:58.500 --> 33:02.500]  but I did study music history in high school. And I,
[33:02.500 --> 33:04.500]  I love Baroque music.
[33:04.500 --> 33:08.500]  One of the books that's holding up my phone right now is an autographed copy
[33:08.500 --> 33:12.500]  of Martin Adams, life of Henry Purcell about his compositions.
[33:12.500 --> 33:16.500]  And I think there's a lot of, a lot of stuff in common
[33:18.500 --> 33:23.500]  between Baroque period music and country music in terms of like the strings
[33:23.500 --> 33:27.500]  and the, the excessively talented finger work.
[33:30.500 --> 33:33.500]  I don't know about, I don't know how much weed they had at the time,
[33:33.500 --> 33:36.500]  though. That would be an interesting thing to look into.
[33:38.500 --> 33:41.500]  They probably had a, their fair share. I mean, if they're bootlegging
[33:43.500 --> 33:45.500]  alcohol and
[33:47.500 --> 33:48.500]  I'm sure weed was in the mix.
[33:50.500 --> 33:52.500]  Oh my gosh. I love OG Coach.
[33:53.500 --> 33:55.500]  I love all cushions and like,
[33:55.500 --> 33:58.500]  I feel like there's like a deeper flavor that just,
[33:58.500 --> 34:00.500]  it works for me every time.
[34:01.500 --> 34:03.500]  So by the way, when I texted you before you,
[34:03.500 --> 34:06.500]  you do smoke flower because all I ever see you doing is dabbing, right?
[34:07.500 --> 34:10.500]  Yeah, I do smoke flower. It just not often.
[34:10.500 --> 34:14.500]  And because I don't smoke flower often when I do, I get
[34:16.500 --> 34:18.500]  Because we, we have,
[34:19.500 --> 34:24.500]  so some bongs being sent down from this guy who is an industrial designer for
[34:28.500 --> 34:32.500]  a company called IDEO. And so it was like,
[34:32.500 --> 34:36.500]  I would like to try your bongs and he's sending two down for us.
[34:37.500 --> 34:41.500]  Well, I have Doc Ray stuff right now too. The, the blue skunk.
[34:43.500 --> 34:45.500]  And although I don't know if I'd want to pack a bowl with that,
[34:45.500 --> 34:50.500]  I've only been packing my like one hitter with it to have one hit at a time of
[34:50.500 --> 34:51.500]  the magical blue skunk.
[34:52.500 --> 34:57.500]  Also since we had our guest from Afghanistan on Haroon and he talked about
[34:57.500 --> 34:58.500]  smoking only with a chillum,
[34:59.500 --> 35:02.500]  I was trying to smoke with my little glass equivalent,
[35:02.500 --> 35:07.500]  trying to be cool. I'm like, I can taste it.
[35:07.500 --> 35:08.500]  I can taste it.
[35:12.500 --> 35:16.500]  Well, we'll, we'll, we'll hook you up with some old school brick hash.
[35:21.500 --> 35:23.500]  Did we find the phone charger? Oh yes.
[35:25.500 --> 35:26.500]  Excellent. Of course, man.
[35:28.500 --> 35:31.500]  We were just talking about some of the similarities that country music can
[35:31.500 --> 35:33.500]  bear to classical music,
[35:33.500 --> 35:36.500]  especially in terms of like the ostinatos or the riffs.
[35:37.500 --> 35:38.500]  Would you?
[35:38.500 --> 35:40.500]  Ostinatos. Uh oh. Watch out.
[35:41.500 --> 35:42.500]  That's just riff.
[35:43.500 --> 35:44.500]  Yeah. I call them riffs.
[35:45.500 --> 35:49.500]  I was wondering if you'd like care to comment or if you've like noticed that
[35:49.500 --> 35:53.500]  kind of brain space. Cause the thing you were saying earlier about math,
[35:53.500 --> 35:56.500]  that's very like 1600s, 1700s.
[35:57.500 --> 36:00.500]  Hey Pete, I'll email you. I'll email it and you can make it available.
[36:00.500 --> 36:03.500]  I guess I wrote a paper about this when I was taking some stupid classes.
[36:04.500 --> 36:08.500]  Look here in the car and army, you got to go to college, man.
[36:09.500 --> 36:13.500]  I tell you what our education system too, buddy. Oh good Lord. Look here.
[36:14.500 --> 36:18.500]  In the army, you have to go to college. I mean, it's just the way it works.
[36:18.500 --> 36:19.500]  If you want to get promoted, you got to go to college.
[36:20.500 --> 36:23.500]  But the only college that's really available, man,
[36:23.500 --> 36:26.500]  I'm sure there's some good ones, but most of them, I mean,
[36:26.500 --> 36:28.500]  they're online colleges as the bottom line.
[36:28.500 --> 36:31.500]  It's just the way it works, brother. And it kills me, but you know,
[36:31.500 --> 36:34.500]  our GI bill set up to pay our tuition or not our GI bill,
[36:34.500 --> 36:38.500]  but our tuition assistance while we're active is set up to pay for a hundred
[36:38.500 --> 36:41.500]  percent of our tuition up to a certain point. Right?
[36:41.500 --> 36:44.500]  Guess what price like these, the, all of these colleges are,
[36:44.500 --> 36:48.500]  you see what I'm saying? I mean, per hour, it's like the cap it's, Oh man,
[36:48.500 --> 36:52.500]  that's just crazy math. You know what a coincidence.
[36:53.500 --> 36:55.500]  It kills me, man. Kills me.
[36:59.500 --> 37:02.500]  Anyways, I'll send you that paper. It's about music and math.
[37:02.500 --> 37:05.500]  I basically took, okay. So if you know music theory, then, you know,
[37:05.500 --> 37:10.500]  the devil's triad like from black Sabbath, black Sabbath. All right.
[37:10.500 --> 37:12.500]  I'll play it for you. Hang on a second. I'll play the riff.
[37:13.500 --> 37:14.500]  Yes.
[37:15.500 --> 37:19.500]  It's like, and then, so here's the octave, right? All right. So check it out.
[37:19.500 --> 37:20.500]  You got this.
[37:23.500 --> 37:27.500]  Right. Right. Right. All right. Now the most consonant frequency. Okay.
[37:27.500 --> 37:30.500]  Okay. So this is where the math comes in.
[37:30.500 --> 37:34.500]  So the most consonant frequency is going to be the frequency that hits at the
[37:34.500 --> 37:38.500]  right ratios, basically. So, because you've got to imagine anytime you have a wave,
[37:38.500 --> 37:42.500]  because everything's a wave, maybe. All right. Not you just to be clear.
[37:42.500 --> 37:44.500]  I just say that to everything all the time. Okay.
[37:47.500 --> 37:50.500]  Okay. I think though that some, some,
[37:50.500 --> 37:53.500]  some troublemakers are both a wave and a particle.
[37:53.500 --> 37:58.500]  Oh, yes, of course. No, they are particles, but I think I subscribe to the belief that,
[37:58.500 --> 38:02.500]  that particles all behave in wave fashion.
[38:03.500 --> 38:06.500]  So basically the particles do this is what I think. Hey, if you ever take them,
[38:07.500 --> 38:09.500]  right. Well, yeah, the electrons,
[38:10.500 --> 38:13.500]  electrons have electron cells around the protons and the neutrons,
[38:13.500 --> 38:17.500]  and then those get smaller thing. So that's exactly it. Okay.
[38:17.500 --> 38:19.500]  It's a constant balance of particles.
[38:19.500 --> 38:23.500]  Okay. It's the balance. And because it's not binary,
[38:23.500 --> 38:26.500]  it's never perfectly balanced people. All right.
[38:26.500 --> 38:29.500]  So it's like this all the time and that creates the wave. I think,
[38:29.500 --> 38:32.500]  I don't know, man, you know, we're just, we're just out in the garage here.
[38:32.500 --> 38:37.500]  All right. But, but with the math on, on the music part specifically,
[38:37.500 --> 38:40.500]  you it's called intermodular distortion.
[38:40.500 --> 38:43.500]  It's basically where one frequency sits atop another frequency,
[38:43.500 --> 38:45.500]  and then the other frequency sits atop another frequency.
[38:45.500 --> 38:46.500]  It's called intermodular distortion.
[38:46.500 --> 38:50.500]  It's basically where one frequency sits atop another frequency and a third
[38:50.500 --> 38:55.500]  frequency appears. And that third frequency will always be a, a,
[38:55.500 --> 39:03.500]  a, a, a mathematic expression of the two frequencies sitting atop each other.
[39:03.500 --> 39:06.500]  It'll be the third warble. I'll show you the warble. Hang on guys.
[39:06.500 --> 39:11.500]  I know that I can explain. I taught, take it out. Hey, I don't speak Korean.
[39:11.500 --> 39:13.500]  Hey, I lived in Korea for a year though. Right.
[39:13.500 --> 39:17.500]  And I taught music whenever I was stationed there, like, you know,
[39:17.500 --> 39:20.500]  my free time or whatever. Oh man. I had to give back.
[39:20.500 --> 39:24.500]  I was drinking way too much back in them days. Gosh. Oh,
[39:26.500 --> 39:32.500]  bless my wife. All right. So this is, this is the, that's consonants.
[39:32.500 --> 39:35.500]  You don't really hear, you hear two frequencies. I mean,
[39:35.500 --> 39:38.500]  you don't even hear two frequencies. You shouldn't. All right. Now, if I,
[39:38.500 --> 39:40.500]  if I change one of those frequencies,
[39:40.500 --> 39:43.500]  now I will create two frequencies because those two frequencies are very close
[39:43.500 --> 39:47.500]  to each other. The intermodular wave is going to be very slow.
[39:47.500 --> 39:50.500]  You're going to hear it. It's going to be evident. I hope,
[39:50.500 --> 39:52.500]  I don't know about the microphone situation, but I bet it'll work. Hang on.
[39:52.500 --> 39:53.500]  Oh,
[39:59.090 --> 40:04.090]  you hear the, so DTMF,
[40:04.090 --> 40:09.090]  let's say if you were a phone switcher and you're back in that day, right.
[40:09.090 --> 40:12.090]  And you're a right. Captain crunch.
[40:12.090 --> 40:15.090]  That's what you were doing. You're blowing DTMF tones.
[40:15.090 --> 40:17.090]  You're blowing two tones at once.
[40:17.090 --> 40:20.090]  That would create a third intermodular frequency.
[40:20.090 --> 40:23.090]  And the third intermodular frequency is actually the one it's looking for.
[40:23.090 --> 40:28.090]  Anyways. All right. So but the intermodular distortion. Okay.
[40:28.090 --> 40:33.090]  So this is where, this is how it comes over into energy consumption, man.
[40:33.090 --> 40:37.090]  It's not crazy. I try and tell people it's not crazy. They don't believe me.
[40:37.090 --> 40:40.090]  All right. So everything resonates at a frequency and don't,
[40:40.090 --> 40:43.090]  don't get all crazy with me now. I'm not talking about, you know,
[40:43.090 --> 40:45.090]  I've got my speakers and shit.
[40:47.090 --> 40:50.090]  Oh, I know what you're saying. You're saying that sound waves exist.
[40:50.090 --> 40:51.090]  I'm right there with you.
[40:53.090 --> 40:57.090]  Thank you. Right. All right. So, but,
[40:57.090 --> 41:01.090]  but mathematically if you're trying to explain these and how you can utilize
[41:01.090 --> 41:06.090]  them and how you can leverage this math to use less electricity,
[41:06.090 --> 41:10.090]  okay. Bear with me. So I build an amp, for instance,
[41:10.090 --> 41:14.090]  I am not trying to sell a ham. Guys, trust me. God bless.
[41:16.090 --> 41:19.090]  Man. I love all you people, but I can't build everybody amps and guitars.
[41:19.090 --> 41:22.090]  I can't, I miss this bottom line. It ain't craftsmanship.
[41:22.090 --> 41:24.090]  This is what I'm talking about. The guy with the hair, man,
[41:24.090 --> 41:27.090]  you're a craftsman at a certain point of,
[41:27.090 --> 41:30.090]  and then it becomes an assembly line. You know what I mean? Anyways.
[41:30.090 --> 41:33.090]  All right. So, so if you're,
[41:33.090 --> 41:35.090]  if you take an amp design, let's say,
[41:35.090 --> 41:38.090]  and you look at it from a standpoint of what frequencies you trying to
[41:38.090 --> 41:42.090]  actually amplify from a guitar, man,
[41:42.090 --> 41:45.090]  this is some heavy nerd shit. You guys really want to talk about this?
[41:46.090 --> 41:49.090]  Let's go for it. Yes. Okay.
[41:52.090 --> 41:55.090]  You tube guys out there. I hope I get it right. I don't want to embarrass us.
[41:56.090 --> 41:59.090]  All of us garage electrician or electrical engineer.
[41:59.090 --> 42:02.090]  Out there trying to kill each other. All right. Hang on. That's what we do.
[42:02.090 --> 42:04.090]  We just sell amps to each other. You know,
[42:04.090 --> 42:07.090]  can we build and kill each other pretty much too bad.
[42:07.090 --> 42:08.090]  It's dangerous as shit.
[42:09.090 --> 42:12.090]  All right. They will explode. All right.
[42:16.090 --> 42:19.090]  This is the best part about having a good garage, man.
[42:19.090 --> 42:22.090]  I burned shit to the ground. I burned shit to the ground.
[42:22.090 --> 42:25.090]  I burned shit to the ground. I burned shit to the ground.
[42:25.090 --> 42:28.090]  I will tell you exactly how far I tell a fucking 12 X seven will go.
[42:28.090 --> 42:30.090]  I don't care. It costs $400 or not.
[42:30.090 --> 42:32.090]  Anyway. All right.
[42:32.090 --> 42:34.090]  Any tube guys just got that reference. I know.
[42:34.090 --> 42:37.090]  All right. So, all right. Hey, who's man.
[42:37.090 --> 42:41.090]  Oh, I love vacuum tubes because vacuum tubes operate at the electron level.
[42:41.090 --> 42:43.090]  That's why you get such beautiful,
[42:43.090 --> 42:45.090]  beautiful, beautiful, beautiful,
[42:45.090 --> 42:47.090]  beautiful, beautiful, beautiful,
[42:47.090 --> 42:49.090]  beautiful, beautiful, beautiful,
[42:49.090 --> 42:51.090]  beautiful, beautiful, beautiful,
[42:51.090 --> 42:52.090]  beautiful, beautiful,
[42:52.090 --> 42:53.090]  electron level.
[42:53.090 --> 42:55.090]  That's why you get such beautiful curves.
[42:57.090 --> 43:00.090]  People, it's the curve, right?
[43:00.090 --> 43:04.090]  Do you know how many op amps and ICs you'd have to put in place in order to
[43:04.090 --> 43:06.090]  get down to the fucking electron level
[43:07.090 --> 43:09.090]  and amplification,
[43:10.090 --> 43:14.090]  natural harmonic distortions and intermodular distortions.
[43:14.090 --> 43:17.090]  Anyways, let's get back to the energy though. OK.
[43:17.090 --> 43:19.090]  So, because that's really what's important here guys.
[43:19.090 --> 43:21.090]  OK. So, all right.
[43:21.090 --> 43:24.730]  All right, so you take, let's say I tune my cab
[43:24.730 --> 43:27.890]  to a frequency and you select your speaker
[43:27.890 --> 43:29.330]  based on that frequency,
[43:29.330 --> 43:32.170]  and you design your amplifier circuit
[43:32.170 --> 43:35.930]  based around amplifying those frequencies.
[43:35.930 --> 43:38.650]  And then you take your guitar, for instance,
[43:38.650 --> 43:42.130]  because I build the guitar, so I wind the pickups,
[43:42.130 --> 43:45.810]  you know, like, so I have control over what,
[43:45.810 --> 43:47.770]  when you do this, you know, like,
[43:47.770 --> 43:50.250]  I can control how much current is produced
[43:50.250 --> 43:52.290]  from that inductor, basically.
[43:52.290 --> 43:54.450]  And I can control how much of it is rolled off,
[43:54.450 --> 43:56.810]  and I can control how much of it is canceled out
[43:56.810 --> 43:58.610]  through Miller capacitance
[43:58.610 --> 44:01.410]  and all these other awesome nerd shits, right?
[44:01.410 --> 44:04.890]  You can control all of that because you have,
[44:04.890 --> 44:06.050]  all right, this is why, you know,
[44:06.050 --> 44:07.770]  when you hear Eric Clapton play Layla
[44:07.770 --> 44:09.930]  and you can't play it in your bedroom, guys,
[44:09.930 --> 44:13.090]  that's because he's playing a strat
[44:13.090 --> 44:16.010]  plugged into probably, I'm just gonna guess here,
[44:16.170 --> 44:20.490]  like a Fender Champ, maybe a Supro,
[44:21.490 --> 44:24.610]  maybe an old Gibson GT5 or something.
[44:24.610 --> 44:28.650]  It's a single-ended five watt, man,
[44:28.650 --> 44:31.010]  back in its day, probably, you know, $100 amp.
[44:31.930 --> 44:36.170]  But in order to get that natural harmonic distortions
[44:36.170 --> 44:38.330]  and all these other natural, beautiful sounds
[44:38.330 --> 44:39.730]  that you can get out of tubes
[44:39.730 --> 44:41.490]  that you cannot get out of anything else,
[44:41.490 --> 44:43.890]  let me hit my elbow on this real quick.
[44:43.890 --> 44:46.130]  All right, that you can't get out of anything else.
[44:46.130 --> 44:49.330]  Oh, hang on, don't let me forget, Pete.
[44:49.330 --> 44:51.890]  Man, this is important too, guys,
[44:51.890 --> 44:53.210]  when it comes to tone.
[44:53.210 --> 44:55.290]  If you're, man, I know some of y'all are musicians.
[44:55.290 --> 44:56.610]  I mean, we smoke weed, right?
[44:56.610 --> 44:57.450]  Hang on.
[44:58.490 --> 44:59.770]  Laughs.
[44:59.770 --> 45:02.570]  All right, so this is what I use for my pickups.
[45:02.570 --> 45:05.010]  Hey, if you guys can do it, go to a state salesman.
[45:05.010 --> 45:07.050]  They're throwing this shit away just so you know.
[45:07.050 --> 45:08.610]  People don't know what it is, man.
[45:08.610 --> 45:10.930]  People don't know what electronic stuff is.
[45:10.930 --> 45:12.610]  If you know how to build guitars
[45:12.610 --> 45:15.690]  or you even recognize guitar parts and shit.
[45:15.690 --> 45:16.530]  Okay.
[45:19.360 --> 45:22.600]  In the 50s, there wasn't no other games in town, man.
[45:22.600 --> 45:26.440]  The $250,000 Stratcher trying to buy,
[45:26.440 --> 45:29.040]  I'm sorry, that was a little Clusterfly.
[45:29.040 --> 45:30.240]  What do they call them in the fish song?
[45:30.240 --> 45:31.640]  All right.
[45:31.640 --> 45:33.400]  So he says,
[45:35.840 --> 45:38.600]  got sidetracked by the Clusterfly, boys.
[45:38.600 --> 45:42.160]  That was a, hey, AK-48 is a great Satiba.
[45:44.880 --> 45:45.720]  All right.
[45:47.600 --> 45:50.640]  Yeah, so let's get back to energy, I guess.
[45:50.640 --> 45:52.040]  Hell, I don't remember where I was.
[45:52.040 --> 45:53.360]  Oh, I know now.
[45:53.360 --> 45:55.280]  Man, I'm gushing all over the place, Pete.
[45:55.280 --> 45:56.320]  I'm embarrassed.
[45:59.760 --> 46:01.560]  It's probably because I've been waiting so long
[46:01.560 --> 46:02.400]  to talk to Pete.
[46:02.400 --> 46:04.120]  That's what it is.
[46:04.120 --> 46:06.160]  I've been stalking him online, buddy.
[46:10.960 --> 46:11.800]  Anyways.
[46:12.800 --> 46:14.280]  Yeah, so back to the energy.
[46:14.280 --> 46:15.120]  Sorry.
[46:16.640 --> 46:17.480]  Back to the energy.
[46:17.480 --> 46:18.320]  I can get there.
[46:18.320 --> 46:19.440]  I'm gonna bring it, boys.
[46:19.440 --> 46:20.280]  I'm gonna bring it back.
[46:20.280 --> 46:22.160]  I'm gonna bring it full circle, I promise.
[46:22.160 --> 46:25.200]  You gotta stay right the way, right this snake, right?
[46:25.200 --> 46:28.720]  All right, so you take your amplifier
[46:28.720 --> 46:32.040]  and if you are now under, you're in control
[46:32.040 --> 46:35.000]  of every frequency you're making and everything else,
[46:35.000 --> 46:39.040]  then you don't have to amplify anything you don't need to.
[46:39.040 --> 46:41.320]  That's basically what all I'm saying.
[46:42.320 --> 46:46.080]  You know, it's not a matter of redesigning things to be,
[46:46.960 --> 46:48.880]  hey man, I don't wanna get into it.
[46:48.880 --> 46:53.520]  Hey, amp guys are real, real particular
[46:53.520 --> 46:54.800]  about the tones they like.
[46:54.800 --> 46:59.000]  And man, who's to say what's good and what's not?
[46:59.000 --> 47:00.840]  People like it whenever I build them amps.
[47:00.840 --> 47:02.040]  I know that.
[47:02.040 --> 47:03.640]  And my amps don't break.
[47:03.640 --> 47:06.760]  Well, if they break, I'll fix them for you.
[47:06.760 --> 47:08.560]  I'll tell you that much.
[47:08.560 --> 47:09.960]  Or I'll give you a bunch of money
[47:09.960 --> 47:11.560]  so that you don't tell nobody.
[47:11.560 --> 47:13.240]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
[47:13.240 --> 47:14.560]  Ha ha ha ha ha.
[47:14.560 --> 47:15.400]  Anyway.
[47:15.400 --> 47:17.440]  I feel like it's okay to be deeply geeky about it
[47:17.440 --> 47:22.040]  because the tonality of the notes that you're delivering,
[47:22.040 --> 47:24.840]  that is like, it's like the huskiness,
[47:24.840 --> 47:27.000]  it's like the huskiness in somebody's voice.
[47:27.000 --> 47:29.480]  It's like the unique elements
[47:29.480 --> 47:32.960]  that make a singer who they are, but for an instrument.
[47:32.960 --> 47:35.520]  And it's always been something important
[47:35.520 --> 47:37.000]  to music aficionados.
[47:37.000 --> 47:39.200]  Like think about Victorian novels
[47:39.200 --> 47:41.240]  where people talk about the tone of a piano
[47:41.240 --> 47:43.480]  and whether it's like a bright tone or not
[47:43.480 --> 47:45.360]  and having a taste for that.
[47:45.360 --> 47:47.640]  Amps is just the modern version of that.
[47:47.640 --> 47:51.680]  And then being stoners, we love to listen to the detail
[47:51.680 --> 47:54.360]  and be like, I would like to really investigate
[47:54.360 --> 47:56.240]  our own taste.
[47:56.240 --> 47:57.080]  Yeah.
[47:57.080 --> 48:01.240]  And the warmth of analog over modern day digital.
[48:01.240 --> 48:03.240]  I mean, that's, I mean, that in my opinion,
[48:03.240 --> 48:05.720]  that's how, that's why we have, that's why it's that way.
[48:05.720 --> 48:08.200]  But you know, there's, man, there's more to it.
[48:08.200 --> 48:10.080]  I mean, in terms of what you're feeling
[48:10.080 --> 48:11.440]  and when you're playing an amp,
[48:11.440 --> 48:15.320]  because especially with the guitars, it's more about,
[48:15.320 --> 48:16.640]  there's more of it that's not more about,
[48:16.640 --> 48:18.680]  but there's a lot of to do with the fact
[48:18.680 --> 48:21.120]  that you have a response to the strings
[48:21.120 --> 48:24.960]  and to the power consumption of the amp itself.
[48:24.960 --> 48:27.840]  So basically if you design the amp correctly,
[48:31.280 --> 48:33.400]  yeah, man, this is the challenge.
[48:34.560 --> 48:37.160]  You should be able to roll it well.
[48:37.160 --> 48:39.760]  My amps, if designed correctly,
[48:39.760 --> 48:41.200]  and you play it through the guitar
[48:41.200 --> 48:43.400]  that it was designed for, you dang mole.
[48:44.800 --> 48:46.960]  Hey, oh man, I got to turn that down.
[48:48.000 --> 48:49.520]  I got to turn that down because that's a guy
[48:49.520 --> 48:50.600]  I just built an amp for.
[48:50.600 --> 48:52.360]  He's probably watching this stream.
[48:53.440 --> 48:54.720]  Hang on.
[48:54.720 --> 48:55.560]  Oh shit.
[48:56.520 --> 48:57.360]  How do I do it?
[48:57.360 --> 48:58.560]  I don't know how.
[48:58.560 --> 49:00.760]  Nobody else text me if you know me, please.
[49:01.920 --> 49:02.920]  All right.
[49:02.920 --> 49:04.680]  I'll turn it down in a minute, Pete.
[49:04.680 --> 49:06.520]  I got to stay on this tangent though right now.
[49:06.600 --> 49:07.760]  Tangentedly.
[49:08.680 --> 49:09.960]  All right.
[49:09.960 --> 49:14.440]  So basically, all I'm advocating here, people,
[49:15.960 --> 49:18.480]  like is when you go through
[49:18.480 --> 49:21.480]  and you're designing an amplifier,
[49:21.480 --> 49:23.920]  just be mindful a little bit
[49:23.920 --> 49:26.000]  of what frequencies you're trying to amplify
[49:26.000 --> 49:27.640]  and the ones you don't need to, man.
[49:27.640 --> 49:28.880]  Brother, look at here.
[49:28.880 --> 49:30.720]  This is 82 Hertz right here.
[49:31.920 --> 49:32.760]  That's it.
[49:32.760 --> 49:34.080]  That's as far as it goes, guys.
[49:34.080 --> 49:36.200]  I don't know why you're building amps
[49:36.800 --> 49:39.520]  where you're trying to amplify 60 Hertz.
[49:39.520 --> 49:40.720]  It don't make no sense.
[49:41.640 --> 49:44.200]  60 Hertz is what comes out of your wall, homie.
[49:44.200 --> 49:45.040]  Come on.
[49:45.040 --> 49:47.200]  That don't make no sense.
[49:47.200 --> 49:48.240]  Anyways.
[49:48.240 --> 49:49.320]  Anyway.
[49:49.320 --> 49:50.800]  Anyways.
[49:50.800 --> 49:52.760]  Oh, don't get me started on that now.
[49:52.760 --> 49:53.760]  Oh man.
[49:53.760 --> 49:55.600]  Oh, electromagnetism.
[49:55.600 --> 49:58.040]  That's, what was the guy, Brandon?
[49:58.040 --> 49:59.880]  Oh man, Brandon's on it now.
[49:59.880 --> 50:01.040]  Brandon's on to something.
[50:01.040 --> 50:02.000]  You need to listen to Brandon.
[50:02.000 --> 50:03.560]  What's his name, Rush?
[50:03.560 --> 50:04.400]  Russ.
[50:04.400 --> 50:05.880]  Yeah.
[50:06.560 --> 50:08.280]  When you were talking about the fundamental laws
[50:08.280 --> 50:11.400]  of the universe earlier and they are,
[50:11.400 --> 50:16.280]  is it gravity, electromagnetism, and then normal force?
[50:16.280 --> 50:17.680]  And is there like one more?
[50:18.720 --> 50:20.840]  I am no physicist.
[50:20.840 --> 50:22.560]  I watched some YouTube videos,
[50:22.560 --> 50:24.160]  just like all the rest of you now.
[50:24.160 --> 50:25.880]  Don't, no, no, no.
[50:25.880 --> 50:26.720]  All right.
[50:26.720 --> 50:31.720]  So, but, so in terms of particle theory,
[50:32.960 --> 50:34.960]  if you're looking at, in my opinion,
[50:34.960 --> 50:37.320]  I mean, if you want to get to the core things,
[50:37.320 --> 50:41.760]  you got to look at like the types of particles first.
[50:41.760 --> 50:43.000]  I mean, you got four particles, right?
[50:43.000 --> 50:46.160]  That we know of, that we, let me rephrase,
[50:46.160 --> 50:47.840]  that we interact with day to day, right?
[50:47.840 --> 50:51.240]  So like photons, electrons, protons, and neutrons.
[50:51.240 --> 50:52.480]  Or neutrons?
[50:52.480 --> 50:53.600]  I always screw this one up.
[50:53.600 --> 50:54.600]  Neutrons, yeah.
[50:54.600 --> 50:55.440]  One of them's in my brain.
[50:55.440 --> 50:56.280]  I know that.
[50:56.280 --> 50:57.640]  And then the smaller guys are quarks,
[50:57.640 --> 50:59.640]  and the quarks have different flavors.
[51:00.640 --> 51:01.960]  What did you say?
[51:01.960 --> 51:03.320]  And then, oh, smaller,
[51:03.320 --> 51:04.880]  so you have subatomic particles,
[51:05.680 --> 51:06.520]  you have molecules, right?
[51:06.520 --> 51:08.400]  And then subatomic, and then atoms,
[51:08.400 --> 51:09.960]  and then subatomic particles,
[51:09.960 --> 51:12.120]  and then smaller than that, quarks.
[51:12.120 --> 51:14.440]  And quarks have different flavors,
[51:14.440 --> 51:16.680]  like up, down, sideways.
[51:16.680 --> 51:18.400]  I forget, because there's a really funny piece
[51:18.400 --> 51:20.040]  of like parody writing about them,
[51:20.040 --> 51:22.320]  where one of the flavors is called sex appeal.
[51:22.320 --> 51:24.280]  I always forget and start laughing
[51:24.280 --> 51:25.800]  at this point in the science.
[51:27.240 --> 51:29.640]  But yeah, it's totally,
[51:29.640 --> 51:31.320]  it's totally what you were talking about
[51:31.320 --> 51:34.400]  in terms of the balance between the negative electrons
[51:34.920 --> 51:36.760]  and the positively charged protons.
[51:36.760 --> 51:40.200]  And then the neutrons being the weight in between, kind of.
[51:41.080 --> 51:42.040]  That's exactly it.
[51:42.040 --> 51:43.080]  I mean, it's all it is.
[51:43.080 --> 51:45.720]  You're just playing with potential.
[51:45.720 --> 51:48.400]  Potential, meaning you are separating
[51:48.400 --> 51:50.440]  a heavily charged positive surface
[51:50.440 --> 51:53.000]  and a negatively charged surface.
[51:53.000 --> 51:55.600]  And there's potential for charge between the two.
[51:55.600 --> 51:57.000]  That's really what's going on, right?
[51:57.000 --> 51:59.480]  And that charge is electrons.
[51:59.480 --> 52:00.680]  In a tube amp, that's just,
[52:00.680 --> 52:03.200]  you heated up the filaments just like in your light bulbs,
[52:03.200 --> 52:06.160]  and now you have electrons boiling off, basically,
[52:06.160 --> 52:08.480]  and you have an electron cloud
[52:08.480 --> 52:11.480]  around that piece of heated metal.
[52:11.480 --> 52:13.440]  So when you heat up metal,
[52:14.480 --> 52:16.960]  when you heat up anything, things happen, right?
[52:16.960 --> 52:18.800]  When you heat up weed, it decarbs.
[52:18.800 --> 52:21.200]  We call it decarbing because we're cool.
[52:21.200 --> 52:22.440]  It decomposes, okay?
[52:22.440 --> 52:23.480]  It loses carbon.
[52:24.960 --> 52:29.080]  But it releases its carbon or whatever.
[52:29.080 --> 52:30.800]  I don't know, honestly, I'm no man,
[52:30.800 --> 52:33.160]  I ain't no biologist, I'll tell you that much.
[52:34.120 --> 52:35.600]  Poor Cocaine Linda.
[52:35.600 --> 52:37.480]  Oh man, that poor woman.
[52:38.920 --> 52:40.240]  She had to email me
[52:43.120 --> 52:47.960]  and tell me to keep my damn crazy particle physics
[52:47.960 --> 52:49.800]  out of her garden professor's group,
[52:49.800 --> 52:52.160]  and I am so sorry, Ms. Linda.
[52:52.160 --> 52:53.080]  I am so sorry.
[52:55.720 --> 52:57.800]  Anyways, I wasn't being mean.
[52:57.800 --> 52:58.960]  I was trying to ask a question,
[52:58.960 --> 53:00.840]  and it was just, man, I couldn't even get it out.
[53:00.840 --> 53:02.120]  You know how it goes.
[53:02.120 --> 53:03.920]  I don't know the verbs.
[53:03.920 --> 53:05.720]  You know what I mean?
[53:05.720 --> 53:06.560]  Anyways.
[53:08.360 --> 53:12.160]  So I want you to play a song for Mia.
[53:13.040 --> 53:13.880]  No, no.
[53:16.880 --> 53:20.640]  I don't know, I have a problem with being a muse
[53:20.640 --> 53:21.920]  in my experience.
[53:21.920 --> 53:22.760]  Yeah, no.
[53:22.760 --> 53:25.080]  You know, I was trying to be the muse.
[53:25.080 --> 53:26.080]  I like the idea.
[53:26.080 --> 53:30.720]  No, no, no, no, because I was trying to be the muse,
[53:30.720 --> 53:32.200]  but you haven't played me a song yet,
[53:32.200 --> 53:33.040]  so I figured maybe-
[53:33.040 --> 53:35.360]  Well, I think the best thing is for you
[53:35.360 --> 53:38.960]  to take a huge grip and then create an ode to the weed.
[53:38.960 --> 53:42.360]  I mean, this is the future cannabis project here.
[53:42.360 --> 53:44.520]  I mean, I'll be your muse.
[53:44.520 --> 53:46.920]  I have no problem being your muse.
[53:46.920 --> 53:51.920]  I think Pete has ulterior motives in mind.
[53:52.560 --> 53:54.920]  I think Pete's afraid to be alone with me.
[53:54.920 --> 53:56.160]  I think that's what's going on here.
[53:56.160 --> 53:59.240]  I think he's probably got three people in the party.
[53:59.240 --> 54:00.080]  That's right.
[54:00.080 --> 54:01.400]  I'm your chaperone.
[54:01.400 --> 54:02.240]  It's okay, buddy.
[54:02.240 --> 54:04.280]  Hey, we all thrive sometimes.
[54:04.280 --> 54:06.440]  We're gonna be fine tonight, it's okay.
[54:06.440 --> 54:07.280]  Yeah, what is it?
[54:07.280 --> 54:10.400]  I'm insecure in my sexuality.
[54:10.400 --> 54:12.720]  No, no, no, that's not true.
[54:12.720 --> 54:15.400]  I would say insecure in your identity.
[54:15.400 --> 54:16.240]  I'm kidding.
[54:16.240 --> 54:17.080]  I love you, buddy.
[54:18.000 --> 54:21.600]  Hey, I don't believe in that sexuality though, that's all.
[54:22.480 --> 54:25.080]  I mean, I think I want to make it clear
[54:25.080 --> 54:29.480]  that any LGBTQ viewers right now
[54:29.880 --> 54:32.400]  have a friend in me just to make that perfectly clear.
[54:32.400 --> 54:35.600]  But I also feel like, Peter,
[54:35.600 --> 54:38.200]  you don't have much experience being a muse.
[54:38.200 --> 54:42.120]  Have you worn, have you done the Greek outfits before
[54:42.120 --> 54:47.120]  and attempted to serenade and inspire art?
[54:47.280 --> 54:51.640]  Oh man, Pete, what can I sing to you
[54:51.640 --> 54:53.560]  that's so sweet and so low?
[54:54.800 --> 54:56.880]  Sing me something sweet.
[54:57.880 --> 55:00.880]  Oh Pete, man, we're gonna get so comfortable tonight.
[55:00.880 --> 55:02.200]  Thank you, baby.
[55:02.200 --> 55:03.520]  Hang on, man.
[55:03.520 --> 55:05.600]  Hang on, let me plug this in.
[55:05.600 --> 55:06.680]  Let me plug in this mic.
[55:06.680 --> 55:08.760]  Oh, I can't hear y'all once I plug in the mic though.
[55:08.760 --> 55:09.600]  What should I do, Pete?
[55:09.600 --> 55:10.440]  Tell me, tell me what to do.
[55:10.440 --> 55:13.560]  Well, no, what I said before is when you play a song,
[55:13.560 --> 55:14.480]  keep it plugged in.
[55:14.480 --> 55:17.120]  When you're done playing, just unplug it and we'll talk.
[55:17.120 --> 55:17.960]  You know what?
[55:17.960 --> 55:20.560]  Let's keep it organic here, boys and girls.
[55:20.560 --> 55:22.000]  I'm gonna just play to you
[55:22.000 --> 55:24.080]  and you tell me if you wanna plug in the mic.
[55:24.080 --> 55:25.440]  If it ain't good enough.
[55:26.240 --> 55:27.560]  You sound good.
[55:28.560 --> 55:29.400]  Shit.
[55:31.680 --> 55:32.920]  Yeah, I heard that before.
[55:32.920 --> 55:35.440]  I gotta tune it up at least, boys and girls.
[55:35.440 --> 55:37.160]  Now let's not get crazy.
[55:37.160 --> 55:39.240]  Pete, man, you are an excellent host.
[55:39.240 --> 55:42.080]  Honestly though, you're doing good stuff out there.
[55:43.240 --> 55:44.760]  Thank you.
[55:44.760 --> 55:47.400]  Oh yeah, I paused real long for that.
[55:48.960 --> 55:51.920]  I wanted you to acknowledge it awkwardly.
[55:53.080 --> 55:54.520]  Man, you gotta hang out.
[55:54.520 --> 55:56.560]  I appreciate the compliment.
[56:03.100 --> 56:04.340]  You know what?
[56:04.340 --> 56:06.500]  You know what I've been trying to grasp, brother?
[56:06.500 --> 56:07.860]  Let me tell you something.
[56:07.860 --> 56:10.420]  I've been trying to grasp like just, oh man.
[56:13.300 --> 56:14.140]  What are we gonna do?
[56:14.140 --> 56:16.300]  You know what I'm saying?
[56:16.300 --> 56:17.780]  I wanna sing a song, Pete.
[56:17.780 --> 56:20.100]  It ain't, I don't even know, man.
[56:20.100 --> 56:20.940]  I'm just gonna sing it
[56:20.940 --> 56:22.860]  because I know people like this, honestly.
[56:23.740 --> 56:26.620]  I took it over to my brother's house and I played it.
[56:26.620 --> 56:28.100]  Oh man, and they liked it.
[56:28.100 --> 56:30.180]  And I was like, I'm sad, I'm good.
[56:30.180 --> 56:33.060]  They're the best judges of music I got, honestly.
[56:33.060 --> 56:35.500]  They play me, dude, let me tell you something.
[56:35.500 --> 56:37.180]  Oh God, I got stories.
[56:37.180 --> 56:38.700]  I gotta tell, I'll sing a song first.
[56:38.700 --> 56:39.700]  All right, hang on.

[58:53.200 --> 58:54.400]  Was it too loud?
[58:54.400 --> 58:56.240]  Was I overdriving the mic or anything, man?
[58:56.240 --> 58:57.840]  I could back up, I'm sorry.
[58:57.840 --> 59:00.480]  You were, that was perfect.
[59:00.480 --> 59:02.600]  Okay, all right, good.
[59:02.600 --> 59:04.320]  Man, I'm really self-conscious.
[59:04.320 --> 59:05.880]  Hey, let me tell you a secret guys.
[59:05.880 --> 59:10.400]  Oh shit, you didn't prep the battlefield at all, did you?
[59:10.400 --> 59:11.920]  You provided no intelligence.
[59:11.920 --> 59:13.520]  Ah, I love you buddy.
[59:17.000 --> 59:22.000]  Look at here now, about four days ago, I found his website.
[59:22.080 --> 59:24.040]  Y'all ever heard of Reddit?
[59:24.040 --> 59:24.880]  Yeah.
[59:25.800 --> 59:29.000]  And Pete, all right, so I've been stalking Pete, number one.
[59:29.000 --> 59:30.160]  Let's just go there.
[59:31.080 --> 59:35.360]  Hey man, I'm an obsessive person, Pete.
[59:35.360 --> 59:38.360]  And I'm obsessed with cannabis right now for some reason.
[59:38.360 --> 59:42.520]  I'll just be honest here, my wife's worried about it.
[59:42.520 --> 59:45.040]  Look, all right, so it all started, you know,
[59:45.040 --> 59:47.000]  whenever I got out of the army and I did the whole thing
[59:47.000 --> 59:48.440]  and I went and recreational smoke
[59:48.480 --> 59:50.280]  and I was like, hey man, I got out of the army,
[59:50.280 --> 59:51.160]  I get it, right?
[59:52.120 --> 59:54.280]  And I liked it, it was cool, but hey, you know, it's funny.
[59:54.280 --> 59:55.240]  The guy behind the counter,
[59:55.240 --> 59:58.520]  the first weed he gave me was one one weed, interesting.
[59:59.560 --> 01:00:01.200]  So I'm gonna throw that out there.
[01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:04.040]  And I definitely enjoyed it.
[01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:08.720]  The next one I smoked, it was a little different.
[01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:13.520]  Evil Dead 2 came alive, so it was great.
[01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:14.360]  What was it?
[01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:16.120]  Oh man, what was it?
[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:17.720]  Oh, it was a mimosa.
[01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:22.360]  That was the first cannabis I smoked.
[01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:23.680]  I can't even remember the brand.
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:25.240]  It was a good one though, I remember that.
[01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:26.640]  Oh man, it was good.
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:28.040]  You know what's weird, dude?
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:30.240]  What's his name hit on this?
[01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:33.080]  Kevin with the terpenes and what's popular?
[01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:36.960]  Man, you ain't joking, buddy.
[01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:41.360]  It frightens me, you know?
[01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:44.160]  And you know what's horrible about it?
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:46.880]  It's not like the cigarette companies, you know,
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:48.880]  or whatever, where I feel like, you know,
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:51.400]  they're like maliciously did it, kinda.
[01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:52.520]  Maybe, I don't know.
[01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:53.720]  Anyways, who knows?
[01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:54.880]  Who knows, all right.
[01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:58.480]  But maybe just a little bit more out for money
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:00.680]  than the cannabis community, I feel.
[01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:04.800]  But that being said, now the market is the market, dude.
[01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:09.640]  I mean, you can't argue with a joint that fries your face.
[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:12.320]  There ain't no arguing with it.
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:13.720]  Whether it's got CBDs in it,
[01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:15.720]  it's been grown organically or not, you know?
[01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:20.280]  And me being me and I play a $50 guitar,
[01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:23.040]  I can imagine you know what weed I buy, right?
[01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:24.400]  Whenever I had to buy it.
[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:27.520]  You know, I bought sun grown,
[01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:29.680]  but it wasn't because that's what I wanted.
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:31.360]  I wanted the fancy stuff, you know?
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:32.840]  And I bought the fancy stuff at first,
[01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:34.960]  but you know, you can't do that.
[01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:37.800]  Dude, I got Giz, B.D., you know what I mean?
[01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:39.400]  That stuff's expensive.
[01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:42.160]  Gosh, man, that's crazy.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.280]  Go ahead, brother.
[01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:46.680]  So Evergreen Valley Seed said
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:49.040]  he should do a Dwayne Allman cover.
[01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:49.880]  You have any-
[01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:50.720]  Oh, I can do that.
[01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:52.200]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:54.960]  Let's go down an Allman Brothers rabbit hole.
[01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:58.680]  Dude, let's go down all the rabbit holes, baby.
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:03.240]  Hey, but did that really come through good?
[01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:05.840]  Oh, that's what I didn't tell you about the Reddit.
[01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:08.080]  So I went on Reddit, man.
[01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:09.760]  Hey, lookie here.
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:12.640]  Man, Reddit, y'all are beautiful, beautiful people.
[01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:13.880]  Oh man, I love them.
[01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:14.720]  Who's this?
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:21.000]  We got someone who appreciates music jumping in with us.
[01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:24.080]  Jam with me, man.
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:26.240]  This is such a rookie move.
[01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:28.960]  I actually fucking have my channel open
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:30.600]  or the YouTube link open.
[01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:31.920]  Look at that.
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:33.000]  You got the shirt.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:33.840]  Is that a Shor?
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:37.320]  Is that the same mic I have, the SM57?
[01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:38.160]  Hey, I got one of those.
[01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:39.200]  The workhorse.
[01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:40.040]  That's the workhorse, baby.
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:41.640]  Hey, you don't need them fancy mics, boys.
[01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:43.360]  Just use your cell phone, come on.
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:46.440]  Whatever you got, use what you got.
[01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:47.760]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:51.240]  What's happening?
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:54.400]  So what, is this a new streamer introduced, man?
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:55.520]  I don't know.
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:56.680]  Hey, buddy, I haven't met you.
[01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:57.840]  I'm the Freedom Grower.
[01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:00.760]  And I think that Peter let me on
[01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:03.360]  because I said I was the West Coast sales manager
[01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:06.200]  for Fender and I did that for 10 years.
[01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:08.480]  And I'm no longer in that position.
[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:12.000]  I quit that, left the whole corporate world,
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.320]  but I'm playing a 59 John English Stratocaster here.
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:20.760]  And I know you're probably saying I could do something
[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:25.560]  better or for a lot less money than this thing costs,
[01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:26.760]  but I worked for the company then.
[01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:29.680]  So I got this thing for 1400 bucks.
[01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:33.200]  And this is a master built John English Fender,
[01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:35.040]  which is a pretty nice guitar.
[01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:38.000]  And I'm a number one, hey, so I didn't, look at here.
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.200]  You know why my company name is Psycho Billy?
[01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:41.800]  Let me tell you another story, brother.
[01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:44.000]  I was gonna ask you that, what your company name was.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:44.840]  That's a great name.
[01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:45.680]  I dig that, man.
[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:47.320]  That's awesome.
[01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:48.880]  It came from a Johnny Cash song.
[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:52.200]  I stole the hell out of it, you know, like everything.
[01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:55.440]  How long have you been a luthier?
[01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:59.760]  Oh man, since Adderall.
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:01.760]  No, let's see.
[01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:04.360]  No, honestly, I quit drinking.
[01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:06.160]  So I booze hard, man.
[01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:08.760]  A luthier, I meant a guitar builder.
[01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:09.800]  That's what I'm talking about.
[01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:11.560]  I'm getting there, brother, trust me.
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:12.400]  Okay.
[01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:15.800]  Hey, you got to move to Tennessee for a little while.
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:17.000]  Take the long way around.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.480]  Gotta give me some frame of reference here.
[01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:22.320]  I'm so sorry.
[01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:26.520]  I'm horrible with people.
[01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:27.360]  Oh no, man.
[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:28.680]  I dig your personality.
[01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:30.360]  You got happy people.
[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:31.240]  I dig your personality.
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:33.120]  You got happiness all over you, man.
[01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:34.440]  Joy and peace and love.
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:36.000]  That's the good stuff.
[01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:39.240]  I don't like hanging out with grumpy people.
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:43.040]  So by the way, where do you live?
[01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:44.680]  You keep laughing, you'll make me laugh.
[01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:45.720]  Are you asking me?
[01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:46.560]  Yeah.
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:50.920]  I'm 9,300 feet up in the Colorado Mountains,
[01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:52.360]  Rocky Mountain High.
[01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:56.880]  And I've been growing up here for six years now outside.
[01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:58.320]  I've been growing up here indoors for longer,
[01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:01.560]  but it's a harsh, very difficult environment.
[01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:03.760]  This has been the best growth season I've ever had.
[01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:07.760]  We had a harsh snow in early September, September 10th.
[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:09.280]  Yeah, I remember that.
[01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:12.440]  Yeah, after that, it's been smooth sailing
[01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:13.960]  and we've been in a drought.
[01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:16.760]  I had the first snow since then yesterday
[01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:17.600]  or was it the day before?
[01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:18.600]  No, it was yesterday.
[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:20.160]  It snowed at the end of the day
[01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:23.520]  and it was just like a quick flash storm.
[01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:28.560]  And last year it was, yeah, it was October 9th
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.400]  that we got the heavy freeze that set in.
[01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:33.840]  So all my sativas didn't make it,
[01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:35.680]  at least the heavy dominant sativas,
[01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:37.320]  they weren't able to actually finish out.
[01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:39.360]  So this year I think I'm gonna be able to make it
[01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:41.800]  because we've got two more weeks of sunshine
[01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:44.280]  and really allows me to finish off
[01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:47.960]  some of those more sativa dominant strains.
[01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:53.120]  So you had the early frost, but no fires.
[01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:54.520]  Lots of fires, man.
[01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:56.640]  I mean, I've had a headache for a week.
[01:05:56.640 --> 01:05:58.600]  I thought I had corona.
[01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:00.800]  I was sitting there having trouble breathing
[01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:03.200]  and I didn't really see the smoke settle in.
[01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:05.200]  And then my wife clued me off
[01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:07.320]  that there was a lot of fire activity in the area
[01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:09.080]  and it was coming down from the north.
[01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:11.320]  And then it just saturated the whole area.
[01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:12.600]  You could just see it.
[01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:15.480]  The sun was red and every day I was waking up
[01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:19.480]  just nasal drainage and the head swollen
[01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:21.840]  and couldn't hear.
[01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:22.920]  It was just, it was crazy.
[01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:24.680]  And then hard breathing,
[01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:27.200]  but it's finally subsided a little bit.
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:29.280]  And yeah, it's been difficult.
[01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:33.880]  So did we lose John?
[01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:36.760]  John is a cool cat.
[01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:39.280]  I love that backdrop there of his studio.
[01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:42.040]  He's got all the cool tools and I love woodworking.
[01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:43.480]  I know, he has it all.
[01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:47.080]  I mean, yeah, he could give us a tour of all his,
[01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:51.480]  his kind of circuitry and
[01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:55.800]  music making equipment.
[01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:56.720]  Hey Mia, cheers.
[01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:58.000]  Nice to meet you as well.
[01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:02.120]  So while we're waiting for John to come back.
[01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:07.120]  I'm just getting some info ready for our guests tomorrow,
[01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:09.120]  which I'm excited for.
[01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:10.680]  They're old friends of mine
[01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:12.680]  and they're finally getting their cannabis to market.
[01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:15.120]  So I'm just like sending details stuff,
[01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:16.400]  but I do have a dab ready.
[01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:18.280]  Actually, oh no, I don't.
[01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:19.120]  This is kicked.
[01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:20.360]  I'll load it again.
[01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:24.560]  But may I ask what you're smoking over there?
[01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:25.880]  If anything?
[01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:26.840]  Who?
[01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:28.720]  You, both of you.
[01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:32.160]  I smoked that AK-48, unfortunately.
[01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:33.640]  Now I'm all got dang mess.
[01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:35.080]  I want to go get me some Big Bud.
[01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:37.000]  I'm going to roll another and pay you boys.
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:37.840]  Hang on.
[01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:41.240]  I smoked the Dubia Queen Mother Goji
[01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:43.400]  while he was actually rolling his.
[01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:45.400]  And that's a real nice strain.
[01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:50.440]  It's a Nepali and a Lotus OG, I think something like that.
[01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:53.840]  And I hadn't heard of those cross strains,
[01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:58.720]  but the taste of it's kind of got like a cherry,
[01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:02.040]  even some little diesel undertones in there.
[01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:03.960]  It's a unique strain, but it was a good yielder
[01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:07.240]  and I held onto it for years, but it's my last year's bottoms
[01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:08.920]  so I'm really excited to harvest this year
[01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:13.920]  because smoking the leftovers.
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:18.520]  But Goji, oh my goodness.
[01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:21.400]  And Goji OG, yeah, that's the other cross strain in it.
[01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:22.320]  That's right.
[01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:23.400]  Yum.
[01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:25.120]  It's good stuff.
[01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:30.120]  I think I've only had Goji once in live resin form
[01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:32.280]  and it was like one gram.
[01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:33.800]  It's like the similar experience I had
[01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:37.040]  with Ghost Train Haze where I had it like once.
[01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:39.960]  Could never find it again.
[01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:42.640]  It's a strong strain right there, Ghost Train Haze.
[01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:45.200]  Hey, guys, I got a question.
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:48.920]  A new person into the cannabis industry here, whatever,
[01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:50.320]  you know, like cannabis culture, I think,
[01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:51.640]  that's the word I'm looking for.
[01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:56.640]  All right, so remember what I was talking about
[01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:58.880]  with the growing of the strains and stuff?
[01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:03.880]  How much in the environment does it impact?
[01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:07.440]  Like, is it as much as what I'm observing?
[01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:08.280]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:09.840]  Is it that intense everywhere?
[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:11.720]  Is it like that every single farm?
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:13.400]  Is your shit just completely different
[01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:15.560]  than what the shit that you thought it was gonna be
[01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:17.200]  when you got the seeds is?
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:18.640]  You know what I mean?
[01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:20.200]  That's a great question.
[01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:23.480]  I didn't actually realize how much the environment
[01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:25.880]  affected the plant until I moved up here.
[01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:29.120]  And then I started realizing that I would have strains,
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:30.800]  they would completely shock out,
[01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:32.360]  especially if I got them as clones
[01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:33.960]  and didn't start them from seeds.
[01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:36.800]  So they would have to almost adapt
[01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:39.560]  and then they would have these interesting anomalies,
[01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:41.200]  weird leaf structures.
[01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:42.840]  And a lot of times I'd pull them.
[01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:44.960]  And I'd think, oh, this plant's just not gonna make it.
[01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:45.920]  It's not strong enough.
[01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:48.840]  I need more Cush or Afghani type strains
[01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:50.200]  because high elevation.
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:53.760]  I need things that are land-raised for that environment.
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:56.600]  But the Queen Mother Goji was a phenomenal example,
[01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:59.000]  actually, I grew that indoors for a long time,
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:02.040]  did great with it, took it outdoors,
[01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:05.080]  freaked out all the way until July,
[01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:07.200]  finally got ahold of herself
[01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:09.760]  and just performed some of the best cannabis I grew,
[01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:12.520]  actually, just because of the environment.
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:16.880]  And people that like my cannabis in particular
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:19.240]  were really fond of that and just wanted more of it.
[01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:22.680]  And I was like, man, I can't grow that like that indoors
[01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:24.120]  because the indoor Queen Mother Goji
[01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:25.680]  was nothing like the outdoor.
[01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:28.680]  The outdoor completely changed the terpene profile,
[01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:32.840]  the bud structure, the way that the trichome production was.
[01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:34.680]  I mean, it looked like a different plant.
[01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:36.320]  You wouldn't even notice,
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:37.720]  you wouldn't even be able to identify
[01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:40.720]  that it was the same strain, same phenotype.
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:43.520]  If you looked at the indoor versus the outdoor version.
[01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:44.360]  Well, so-
[01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:47.600]  Actually influences it quite heavily.
[01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:53.600]  So in terms of what I'm thinking, maybe guys, I don't know.
[01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:55.760]  All right, so here's my theory.
[01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:58.920]  Hey, I hope my brothers are listening right now.
[01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:00.400]  They're probably laughing their asses off.
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:03.320]  My conspiracy theory I'm about to throw out here, hang on.
[01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:09.880]  I think Kim Dog and Kush OG and Skunk Number One
[01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:11.880]  and hold on, what's the other one
[01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:14.000]  that basically made everything that I buy?
[01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:17.200]  You know, the four bag seeds,
[01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:19.040]  you know what I'm talking about, right?
[01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:22.280]  Dude, man, I'm swearing brother.
[01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:23.840]  I am swearing that it's just,
[01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:25.680]  look, the reason why you ain't gonna get the shit
[01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:28.640]  is because it came out when it was grown
[01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:30.480]  in an outdoor environment maybe.
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:32.880]  And so, okay, so here's the deal.
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:34.840]  All right, when plants grow,
[01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:38.160]  they develop somatic mutations along their growth.
[01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:40.280]  If I'm understanding it correctly, okay.
[01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:43.760]  And these somatic mutations are built out of basically
[01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:47.520]  enzymic acids and other things that are present,
[01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:50.200]  okay, and that's key now, that they're present.
[01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:53.840]  Now I know that you cannot have two plants communicating.
[01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:55.720]  However, electrically speaking.
[01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:57.120]  You can't?
[01:11:57.120 --> 01:12:01.760]  Right, well, hey, actually, hey, who fucking knows?
[01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:04.120]  All right, I ain't gonna say you can't.
[01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:07.640]  All right, but anyway, hey, Swami, dude, hey,
[01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:09.240]  I ain't gonna argue with him.
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:11.400]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:14.200]  I like his style.
[01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:15.040]  Me too.
[01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:16.640]  I aspire to dress like that one day.
[01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:19.160]  As soon as I don't have to hold down any kind of job
[01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:23.480]  or do anything to, you know, I'll just go total yogi.
[01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:24.600]  And wear all kinds.
[01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:25.920]  The white robe.
[01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:26.760]  Yeah.
[01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:27.600]  Yeah, slick.
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:29.000]  The lounge wear.
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:30.800]  The Hindu religion.
[01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:33.920]  Look at here, any religion you can have an atheist,
[01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:34.760]  that's killer.
[01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:38.840]  But also, just gonna throw this out here, guys.
[01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:41.080]  This is some food for thought.
[01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:43.240]  When I was looking at religions when I got out of the army,
[01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:44.840]  because I was trying to find brotherhood,
[01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:46.080]  boys, I'm telling you now.
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:48.080]  That's all that's really going on, I think.
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:49.320]  I found some, you know.
[01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:50.320]  Hey, I love you guys.
[01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:51.160]  You're great.
[01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:55.720]  But, you know, when I was out there searching,
[01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:59.560]  you know, I was reading about some religious stuff.
[01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:01.400]  I'm not a particularly religious person
[01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:02.320]  due to my upbringing.
[01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:04.680]  You know, it's kind of crammed down there, you know.
[01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:08.800]  And so, I was looking at Hindus.
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:10.760]  And I was reading this article about how Hindus
[01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:12.400]  is like the only religion that,
[01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:14.760]  wait, what was it?
[01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:17.880]  Oh, that you're not allowed to judge another man's,
[01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:19.880]  but Swami's the one that said it, I think.
[01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:21.440]  And then I looked it up,
[01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:22.920]  just to make sure I wasn't, you know,
[01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:24.720]  getting that Swami pulled out of there.
[01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:26.200]  Anyways, so.
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:27.600]  Yeah, even Jesus said that,
[01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:29.080]  judge not ye be judged.
[01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:31.160]  Hey, I'm getting there, my friend.
[01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:32.360]  I'm getting there.
[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:34.080]  It's like every religion.
[01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:35.320]  Oh man.
[01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:38.440]  And so, I was like, man, that's interesting.
[01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:40.640]  That's interesting that that's like a major tenant though.
[01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:42.080]  That's the point, that this is like,
[01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:45.240]  in Hindu, honestly, that's kind of like on the front door.
[01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:48.720]  And so, and I thought to myself,
[01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:51.720]  maybe I'm a Hindu, maybe I'm a Hindu, you know.
[01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:54.240]  And I thought, man, if only other religions
[01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:56.400]  had some sort of built-in mechanism
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:58.440]  where you weren't supposed to judge motherfuckers.
[01:13:58.440 --> 01:13:59.600]  You know what I'm saying, guys?
[01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:00.440]  Come on.
[01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:01.280]  Oh, life.
[01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:02.680]  It's a human condition.
[01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:04.280]  Because we all wanna be liked
[01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:05.520]  and we all wanna be accepted,
[01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:07.560]  so we all seek approval.
[01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:08.760]  And that's kind of a,
[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:10.120]  we're brought up to do that, right?
[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:12.120]  We're told to go out into the world, be somebody,
[01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:15.280]  get a title, you know, make something of yourself.
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:16.800]  Make yourself important.
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:18.440]  Go make a bunch of money.
[01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:20.880]  But you know, we don't really define success
[01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:22.160]  for ourselves or happiness.
[01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:25.160]  So a lot of times, we end up chasing those things
[01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:27.040]  and we're seeking the judgment of others.
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:28.080]  We want to be accepted.
[01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:28.920]  We want to be accepted.
[01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:30.240]  We're seeking the judgment of others.
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:31.920]  We want them to approve of us.
[01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:33.920]  And then they do, and we get all this status
[01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:34.880]  and we get all this money,
[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:36.440]  and we're fucking miserable.
[01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:38.000]  Two-car garage, baby.
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:39.480]  The Joneses, keeping up with the Joneses.
[01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:40.320]  Well, I look at your life,
[01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:41.880]  I'm looking at your studio back there
[01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:43.360]  with all your woodworking tools.
[01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:44.760]  Because I sit out here in the forest
[01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:46.880]  and I do mortise and tenon work
[01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:48.760]  and I have like these, you know,
[01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:52.240]  whole hog Milwaukee glorified pencil sharpeners
[01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:54.600]  that take a big old six-inch diameter log
[01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:57.240]  and then drill it so I can combine them together,
[01:14:57.240 --> 01:14:59.840]  like Lincoln logs and make chairs and all this stuff.
[01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:00.920]  I love woodworking.
[01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:03.080]  Look at that beautiful tool.
[01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:07.680]  This is a slick from the 1800s, brother.
[01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:09.840]  Man, I rescued all these tools.
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:10.680]  I love them.
[01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:13.000]  The best tools were made hand forged in the 1800s.
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:17.280]  I have draw knives I got for 10 bucks on eBay, 20 bucks.
[01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:20.440]  These are the best quality knives you could ever imagine.
[01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:22.560]  You would never find something made this way today
[01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:24.200]  and nobody wants them because-
[01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:26.640]  I'll just make a big mess pulling tools off the wall,
[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:29.320]  hey, shoot me a FaceTime.
[01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:30.360]  Yeah, let's do it, buddy.
[01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:32.040]  I'd love to talk with you more.
[01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:35.280]  They were manufactured before planned obsolescence
[01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:36.560]  was a thing.
[01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:37.400]  Exactly.
[01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:38.240]  Yeah, and you know,
[01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:40.760]  oh, so that was what I was gonna get to earlier.
[01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:42.000]  Let me roll this damn joint.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:42.840]  Hey, Bogart.
[01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:43.680]  All right, so-
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:44.840]  I'm gonna smoke one.
[01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:45.680]  Yeah, right.
[01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:46.520]  So what I was getting earlier-
[01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:47.360]  I'm gonna grab my bong, I'll be right back.
[01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:51.080]  When you just said that, that's super key, you know.
[01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:52.240]  I'm sorry.
[01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:54.120]  Oh, I said I'm gonna grab my bong, I'll be right back,
[01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:55.680]  but I can still hear you.
[01:15:55.680 --> 01:15:56.800]  Good stuff, brother.
[01:15:56.800 --> 01:16:01.200]  So whenever I use those old electronics parts,
[01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:03.480]  I don't wanna say it's like, you know,
[01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:05.360]  almost everything and stuff,
[01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:08.040]  but man, if you're talking about an inductor
[01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:12.600]  and it's been extruded multiple times through recycling,
[01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:14.480]  that's not virgin copper anymore.
[01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:19.480]  And the electromagnetic capabilities
[01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:23.320]  of that have been diminished, I believe.
[01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:26.160]  Now, don't quote me on none of this,
[01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:30.200]  but I do seriously think that there is something
[01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:32.360]  to be said for American-
[01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:34.160]  Oh man, I hate saying that.
[01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:37.160]  Mid-century American made copper made stuff
[01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:38.120]  is real good stuff.
[01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:39.680]  That's all I'm gonna say.
[01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:43.000]  But now, keep in mind, if you're a guitarist out there,
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.200]  keep this in mind.
[01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:46.760]  In 1950s, there wasn't nobody else.
[01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:49.520]  I mean, okay, Fender wasn't making their own tubes,
[01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:53.280]  speakers, transformers, capacitors, resistors,
[01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:55.240]  actually, they did have caps for a little while,
[01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:56.560]  but only for their guitars.
[01:16:56.560 --> 01:16:58.640]  And they was probably just some shit Leo got
[01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:00.120]  and didn't have a tag on it, buddy.
[01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:01.200]  I love Leo Fender.
[01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:02.720]  Not as much as Paul Bigsby though.
[01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:04.760]  Paul Bigsby's my man, all right?
[01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:06.640]  His famous quote, I can build anything,
[01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:08.320]  man, I live my life like that.
[01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:10.160]  Anyways, all right, so,
[01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:14.040]  so, shit, tangent.
[01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:14.880]  Did it, did it, did it.
[01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:19.480]  I gotta get this big butt rolling, bud.
[01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:20.920]  It was the wood too though, right?
[01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:24.320]  Because back then, wood wasn't in such high demand,
[01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:26.360]  so it was able to sit and cure and age
[01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:28.080]  for sometimes hundreds of years.
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:30.120]  They'd build those pre-war Martins out of,
[01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:32.960]  you can't source wood like that now.
[01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:36.000]  So, Pete, can you do me a favor, man?
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:37.520]  I'm so sorry to have you do this,
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:39.720]  but I feel like, kind of like it's your job.
[01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:42.360]  Go for it.
[01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:46.880]  Would you go to my Psycho Billy webpage, okay?
[01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:48.720]  Or actually, if anybody out there, my friends,
[01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:50.040]  probably got the link.
[01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:52.360]  There's a guitar I built as a Les Paul.
[01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:54.520]  All right, it was a Les Paul copy.
[01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:55.840]  All right, it was a single cut.
[01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:57.160]  What do they do in the industry, buddy?
[01:17:57.160 --> 01:17:59.280]  You can't be messing around nowadays.
[01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:00.320]  They'll sue your ass.
[01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:01.160]  Paul Reed Smith.
[01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:02.640]  The Paul Reed Smith.
[01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:04.640]  All right, so, it was a single cut.
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:06.080]  Hey, let me point out something else
[01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:09.640]  that's real interesting about this lawsuit business, okay?
[01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:13.760]  Dude, let me go get a guitar and show you something.
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:18.400]  Man, all right, my friend built me this guitar.
[01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:23.160]  And he basically, the shape of it is, all right.
[01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:28.000]  So if you take a classical guitar, a classical guitar,
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.720]  and you do a cutaway, you have a Les Paul.
[01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:32.120]  That's really what it is.
[01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:34.720]  They took a Les Paul, they took a Spanish,
[01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:37.560]  or maybe a triplet or something, a template,
[01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:41.000]  and put a cutaway in that, you know, done.
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:44.840]  And so when they start getting known to people about this,
[01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:47.840]  I mean, it really irks me, man.
[01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:49.240]  It irks me to no end.
[01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:53.280]  I mean, because, dude, look, I ain't no competition for you.
[01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:55.800]  And the people I've seen you harassing ain't neither.
[01:18:55.800 --> 01:18:56.640]  All right?
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:18:59.440]  Come on, people, leave them alone.
[01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:03.080]  I got to roll with joints.
[01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:06.360]  I always wanted to learn classical.
[01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:09.400]  That's such a dedicated commitment.
[01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:11.760]  You know, my neighbor actually,
[01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:14.480]  he built those Spanish guitars for himself
[01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:15.920]  because he got so into classical.
[01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:18.800]  That's part of why I'm not going into classical
[01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:20.480]  is because I've seen how all-encompassing
[01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:22.320]  and just, you know, completely,
[01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:24.760]  you can become obsessed with it.
[01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:25.600]  That's all you do.
[01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:28.160]  We were talking about the similarities before,
[01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:30.800]  especially with math.
[01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:32.760]  You mean sight reading wise or theory wise?
[01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:34.840]  Because theory wise, there's no difference
[01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:36.160]  between any style, in my opinion.
[01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:38.040]  I mean, honestly, it's just math, you know?
[01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:39.480]  It's the interval.
[01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:40.320]  That's what I like to call it.
[01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:43.400]  No, I mean, even just the foundational aspects
[01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:47.120]  of the finger picking, the right hand movement.
[01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:47.960]  Oh, yeah.
[01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:50.320]  The percussive aspects of classical.
[01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:51.720]  And honestly, let's face it,
[01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:53.240]  most people are not studying theory.
[01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:56.200]  So if you're coming to like classical guitar
[01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:59.480]  from maybe learning your A, E, and G chord
[01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:01.600]  and a few blue scales, you know what I mean?
[01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:03.800]  It's a whole different world.
[01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:05.960]  You've got just a big foundation.
[01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:06.880]  You have to get under your feet
[01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:09.520]  even before the stuff starts connecting.
[01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:12.240]  So it's jazz as well, right?
[01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:13.320]  I mean, so you're right.
[01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:14.960]  They all are interrelated.
[01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:17.080]  If you learn jazz, then you're gonna know classical.
[01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:18.840]  You're gonna be able to transfer over
[01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:20.480]  to classical a lot quicker.
[01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:21.320]  But-
[01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:22.920]  Yeah, I mean, so I kind of akin it to,
[01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:25.880]  all right, so when I started first building tube amps,
[01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:27.560]  there's this tube amp group on Facebook.
[01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:29.280]  Man, if y'all wanna learn how to build tube amps,
[01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:32.080]  go to, I think it's like VacuumTubeDIY.
[01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:34.360]  And there's a guy that runs that.
[01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:36.560]  He is just the salt of the earth, boys.
[01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:38.320]  And he has the patience of Job.
[01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:40.600]  Anyways.
[01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:46.600]  He basically, on repeat, told me,
[01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:49.520]  study electron theory, you know?
[01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:53.040]  And of course, I'm like, just building amps, you know?
[01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:55.160]  Dude, I'm telling you, the second I listened to him,
[01:20:55.160 --> 01:20:56.800]  man, the whole world changed.
[01:20:56.800 --> 01:20:58.280]  So here's what I'd tell people.
[01:20:58.280 --> 01:20:59.400]  Study the interval.
[01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:02.120]  What is it?
[01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:03.640]  I think it's a step, step, half-step,
[01:21:03.640 --> 01:21:06.160]  step, step, half-step, or whatever.
[01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:08.800]  It's simple, but it's the basis of everything.
[01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:10.280]  It's do, re, mi, fa, so, la, ti, do.
[01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:12.240]  You already know it, guys.
[01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:13.360]  And you can do it anywhere.
[01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:14.520]  And you can do it with anything.
[01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:15.440]  That's the best part.
[01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:17.680]  Ask, man, I'm telling you, I got friends that come over,
[01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:19.880]  and we'll pick up, hey, pick up an instrument.
[01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:21.800]  We're gonna learn how to play some songs.
[01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:23.280]  I can jam anything, man.
[01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:24.120]  Oh, I love it.
[01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:25.280]  I love it.
[01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:26.120]  Yeah.
[01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:27.920]  It ain't hard.
[01:21:31.580 --> 01:21:32.820]  Speak for yourself.
[01:21:32.820 --> 01:21:33.860]  I suck, but I'm,
[01:21:34.860 --> 01:21:36.660]  I've been playing my whole life.
[01:21:36.660 --> 01:21:40.780]  And you know what's funny is when I sold guitars,
[01:21:40.780 --> 01:21:42.020]  I lost the love for it.
[01:21:42.020 --> 01:21:44.220]  It became like moving boxes.
[01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:46.780]  And it was so sterile and synthetic
[01:21:46.780 --> 01:21:50.300]  that when I played guitar, it was to sell a guitar, right?
[01:21:50.300 --> 01:21:53.260]  Because you go in a store, and you do your few licks.
[01:21:53.260 --> 01:21:55.300]  Yeah, listen how great that sounds.
[01:21:55.300 --> 01:21:56.980]  But when I left the corporate world.
[01:21:56.980 --> 01:21:58.060]  You better send me an email or something.
[01:21:58.060 --> 01:22:00.460]  Yeah, I fell back in love with the music again.
[01:22:00.460 --> 01:22:02.380]  And that's where I'm at right now.
[01:22:02.380 --> 01:22:05.460]  So I love cannabis, and I'm gonna start doing
[01:22:05.460 --> 01:22:06.900]  more gross stuff on my channel again.
[01:22:06.900 --> 01:22:08.180]  But I got away from it for a bit
[01:22:08.180 --> 01:22:10.900]  because I felt like YouTube got pretty toxic with it.
[01:22:10.900 --> 01:22:12.460]  So I just started focusing on music,
[01:22:12.460 --> 01:22:15.420]  and that's all I've been doing on my channel for 2020.
[01:22:15.420 --> 01:22:16.820]  Just playing guitar.
[01:22:16.820 --> 01:22:20.260]  That sounds like a mentally healthy approach for you.
[01:22:20.260 --> 01:22:21.220]  Yeah, it was great.
[01:22:21.220 --> 01:22:22.260]  I've had a blast.
[01:22:22.260 --> 01:22:23.540]  Well, speaking of which,
[01:22:23.540 --> 01:22:26.220]  do you wanna play a song for us right now?
[01:22:26.220 --> 01:22:27.460]  Oh my gosh.
[01:22:27.460 --> 01:22:28.300]  I would love to.
[01:22:28.300 --> 01:22:29.140]  Yeah, you play a song for us.
[01:22:29.140 --> 01:22:30.060]  Or do you want to?
[01:22:30.060 --> 01:22:30.900]  No.
[01:22:30.900 --> 01:22:31.740]  You, no, you.
[01:22:31.740 --> 01:22:33.380]  Maybe I'll put a solo in there.
[01:22:33.380 --> 01:22:34.220]  Hey, you can do it.
[01:22:34.220 --> 01:22:35.300]  It's gonna be an E, all right?
[01:22:35.300 --> 01:22:37.020]  And then you solo an E minor.
[01:22:37.020 --> 01:22:37.860]  E minor.
[01:22:37.860 --> 01:22:38.700]  You may know it.
[01:22:38.700 --> 01:22:39.940]  Everybody is.
[01:22:39.940 --> 01:22:40.780]  There's gonna be a delay.
[01:22:40.820 --> 01:22:41.900]  Maybe your E real quick,
[01:22:41.900 --> 01:22:44.340]  just so I can hear if I'm in tune.
[01:22:44.340 --> 01:22:45.180]  Yeah.
[01:22:53.980 --> 01:22:54.820]  Yep.
[01:23:05.070 --> 01:23:17.050]  All right, here we go, here we go.
[01:23:17.050 --> 01:23:19.290]  He was a hard-headed man.
[01:23:19.290 --> 01:23:22.330]  He was brutally handsome, y'all.
[01:23:22.330 --> 01:23:24.090]  She was terminally pretty.
[01:23:24.090 --> 01:23:25.090]  He held her.
[01:23:25.090 --> 01:23:30.090]  She held him for ransom in the heart of the cold, cold city.
[01:23:31.090 --> 01:23:35.090]  They had a nasty reputation as a cruel dude.
[01:23:35.090 --> 01:23:37.090]  They said he was ruthless.
[01:23:37.090 --> 01:23:39.090]  They said he was cruel.
[01:23:39.090 --> 01:23:43.090]  They had one thing in common, good and bad.
[01:23:43.090 --> 01:23:48.090]  She'd say, faster, faster, the lights are turning red.
[01:23:48.090 --> 01:23:53.090]  Life in the fast lane surely make you lose your mind.
[01:23:53.090 --> 01:23:56.090]  Surely make you lose your mind.
[01:23:56.090 --> 01:23:58.090]  Life in the fast lane.
[01:24:00.090 --> 01:24:04.090]  Life in the fast lane, everything all the time.
[01:24:04.090 --> 01:24:06.090]  Life in the fast lane.
[01:24:08.090 --> 01:24:11.090]  Eager for action, hot for the game.
[01:24:11.090 --> 01:24:15.090]  The common attraction, the drop of a name.
[01:24:15.090 --> 01:24:18.090]  Took all the right pills.
[01:24:18.090 --> 01:24:20.090]  All the right pills.
[01:24:20.090 --> 01:24:23.090]  Outrageous parties, paid heavenly bills.
[01:24:23.090 --> 01:24:28.090]  There were lines on the mirror, lines on her face.
[01:24:28.090 --> 01:24:30.090]  They pretended not to notice.
[01:24:30.090 --> 01:24:32.090]  They were caught up in the race.
[01:24:32.090 --> 01:24:36.090]  Out every evening until it was late.
[01:24:36.090 --> 01:24:39.090]  She was too tired to make it in.
[01:24:39.090 --> 01:24:41.090]  Too tired to fight about it.
[01:24:41.090 --> 01:24:46.090]  Life in the fast lane surely make you lose your mind.
[01:24:46.090 --> 01:24:48.090]  Life in the fast lane.
[01:24:52.490 --> 01:24:55.490]  Man, I'm so god dang nervous.
[01:24:55.490 --> 01:24:56.490]  Woo, yay!
[01:24:56.490 --> 01:24:58.490]  You know what I love is,
[01:24:58.490 --> 01:25:01.490]  either of you guys listened to like early ZZ Top
[01:25:01.490 --> 01:25:03.490]  before they became big?
[01:25:03.490 --> 01:25:05.490]  Before they had reverb, you mean?
[01:25:05.490 --> 01:25:10.490]  Yeah, well, just, like I feel like Prince
[01:25:13.490 --> 01:25:16.490]  must have listened to early ZZ Top,
[01:25:17.490 --> 01:25:19.490]  like Hot, Blue and Righteous.
[01:25:19.490 --> 01:25:20.490]  You know that song?
[01:25:21.490 --> 01:25:22.490]  You said Prince?
[01:25:23.490 --> 01:25:27.490]  What, ZZ Top, Hot, Blue and Righteous.
[01:25:28.490 --> 01:25:29.490]  I don't know.
[01:25:29.490 --> 01:25:33.490]  And then I feel like Prince must have listened to that.
[01:25:33.490 --> 01:25:34.490]  Probably.
[01:25:35.490 --> 01:25:41.490]  Prince is a, well, man, lot of artists,
[01:25:41.490 --> 01:25:43.490]  lot of artists out there, boys and girls.
[01:25:43.490 --> 01:25:45.490]  Out on Reddit, there's a bunch of artists right now.
[01:25:45.490 --> 01:25:46.490]  Bunch of them.
[01:25:46.490 --> 01:25:47.490]  Real good ones, too.
[01:25:47.490 --> 01:25:51.490]  Yo, Psycho, you're a great singer and a great player, man.
[01:25:51.490 --> 01:25:52.490]  That was awesome.
[01:25:52.490 --> 01:25:54.490]  Oh, man, I was about to swap H2 Gits.
[01:25:54.490 --> 01:25:55.490]  Hang on, it'll get tiring.
[01:25:55.490 --> 01:25:57.490]  You should have kept grooving, though, man.
[01:25:57.490 --> 01:25:59.490]  I was going to lay a lead down on top of that.
[01:25:59.490 --> 01:26:00.490]  I was waiting for the-
[01:26:00.490 --> 01:26:01.490]  Oh, man, I'm so sorry.
[01:26:01.490 --> 01:26:02.490]  It's okay.
[01:26:02.490 --> 01:26:04.490]  I just got nervous and I wanted to stop playing.
[01:26:07.490 --> 01:26:09.490]  Dude, I feel the same way.
[01:26:09.490 --> 01:26:11.490]  It's just the four of us.
[01:26:11.490 --> 01:26:13.490]  I get stage fright big time.
[01:26:13.490 --> 01:26:14.490]  Like, it's weird.
[01:26:14.490 --> 01:26:17.490]  If there's 20, 30 people in a room or something, I'm okay.
[01:26:17.490 --> 01:26:20.490]  But on this D-Live thing, they'll host you sometimes.
[01:26:20.490 --> 01:26:24.490]  And I've had it where there's been 100 plus people or something in the room.
[01:26:24.490 --> 01:26:28.490]  And I just, I'm not even looking at how many people are in here right now
[01:26:28.490 --> 01:26:31.490]  because for whatever reason, once it gets up to that number,
[01:26:31.490 --> 01:26:35.490]  I start sweating and I'm like, oh, no, too many people are looking.
[01:26:36.490 --> 01:26:37.490]  Can't perform, stage fright.
[01:26:38.490 --> 01:26:41.490]  Yeah, man, look, man.
[01:26:42.490 --> 01:26:46.490]  So, Evergreen Valley Seed said Purple Rain.
[01:26:46.490 --> 01:26:49.490]  And it's kind of like Hot, Blue, and Righteous.
[01:26:50.490 --> 01:26:52.490]  Or iGOOP said Brown Sugar.
[01:26:52.490 --> 01:26:56.490]  And I think, like, I got to go back and listen to some of that stuff.
[01:26:56.490 --> 01:27:00.490]  But, like, there were definitely ZZ Top songs where I was like,
[01:27:01.490 --> 01:27:05.490]  it sounds like Prince listened to this and just did, like, a, you know,
[01:27:06.490 --> 01:27:07.490]  change the lyrics.
[01:27:07.490 --> 01:27:08.490]  Right.
[01:27:09.490 --> 01:27:10.490]  Kind of like, hey, man, lookie here.
[01:27:11.490 --> 01:27:13.490]  I've got songs, man, like that one right there.
[01:27:13.490 --> 01:27:17.490]  Man, I'm pissed off that I wrote that lick around another song.
[01:27:17.490 --> 01:27:19.490]  I should have saved that lick.
[01:27:19.490 --> 01:27:20.490]  That was a good lick, man.
[01:27:21.490 --> 01:27:22.490]  Anyways.
[01:27:23.490 --> 01:27:24.490]  It's cool, though, man.
[01:27:24.490 --> 01:27:25.490]  People love it.
[01:27:25.490 --> 01:27:26.490]  That's all that matters, baby.
[01:27:26.490 --> 01:27:27.490]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:27:27.490 --> 01:27:29.490]  I love that kind of finger picking.
[01:27:29.490 --> 01:27:30.490]  That stuff's not easy.
[01:27:30.490 --> 01:27:34.490]  It takes a long time to get your hands to even just think about doing stuff like that.
[01:27:35.490 --> 01:27:36.490]  I do a bastard version.
[01:27:36.490 --> 01:27:37.490]  I'll show it to you.
[01:27:37.490 --> 01:27:38.490]  It's real cheap and easy.
[01:27:38.490 --> 01:27:39.490]  Hang on.
[01:27:39.490 --> 01:27:40.490]  It's easy, man.
[01:27:41.490 --> 01:27:43.490]  I do it like I want to learn the bastard version.
[01:27:43.490 --> 01:27:44.490]  That sounds perfect for me.
[01:27:44.490 --> 01:27:46.490]  Yeah, that's what I do, baby.
[01:27:46.490 --> 01:27:47.490]  Look here.
[01:27:47.490 --> 01:27:48.490]  You cut these off.
[01:27:48.490 --> 01:27:49.490]  You cut them off.
[01:27:49.490 --> 01:27:50.490]  You only need these two.
[01:27:53.490 --> 01:27:54.490]  I kind of saw you doing that.
[01:27:54.490 --> 01:27:56.490]  You don't pull that third finger in there.
[01:27:56.490 --> 01:27:57.490]  Wow.
[01:27:58.490 --> 01:27:59.490]  Sounds so full.
[01:28:00.490 --> 01:28:03.660]  Oh, you froze up.
[01:28:04.660 --> 01:28:05.660]  Darn.
[01:28:07.660 --> 01:28:08.660]  We lost them.
[01:28:10.660 --> 01:28:11.660]  He'll be back.
[01:28:12.660 --> 01:28:13.660]  I really wanted to learn that, too.
[01:28:15.660 --> 01:28:16.660]  He was in a seat.
[01:28:18.660 --> 01:28:20.660]  As the reception comes back in.
[01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:27.080]  All right, so we got another...
[01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:29.080]  Hold on.
[01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:32.080]  Someone else is going to join.
[01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:36.080]  Well, why don't you play something while we're waiting for him to come back on?
[01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:44.080]  That's kind of like my whole thing was getting people to just play music and other people can roll joints.
[01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:45.080]  That's so cool.
[01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:47.080]  Listen.
[01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:49.080]  All right, I'll do something.
[01:28:51.930 --> 01:28:55.930]  My kids are asleep, so it's all going direct from my pedals in here.
[01:28:55.930 --> 01:28:58.930]  So I don't really know what the sound is going to be like here, but I'll just...
[01:29:03.930 --> 01:29:04.930]  I hear that.
[01:29:21.210 --> 01:29:25.210]  I can't do any singing or whatever at the same time, but it kind of sounds like crap.
[01:29:25.210 --> 01:29:26.210]  Digital direct.
[01:29:26.210 --> 01:29:28.210]  We were just talking about tube amps and tone.
[01:29:47.700 --> 01:29:48.700]  Conversation like that.
[01:29:49.700 --> 01:29:50.700]  That is totally insufficient.
[01:29:51.700 --> 01:29:52.700]  I usually mic up my tube amp.
[01:29:53.700 --> 01:30:00.700]  Well, keep in mind, he was playing through his phone microphone, so we can all...
[01:30:00.700 --> 01:30:01.700]  It still sounded amazing.
[01:30:02.700 --> 01:30:03.700]  I'm going to have to get a new mic.
[01:30:04.700 --> 01:30:05.700]  I'm going to have to get a new mic.
[01:30:05.700 --> 01:30:06.700]  He's coming back.
[01:30:06.700 --> 01:30:07.700]  He's logging back in.
[01:30:09.700 --> 01:30:11.700]  I'm a pretty average guitar player, to be honest.
[01:30:11.700 --> 01:30:12.700]  I love guitar.
[01:30:12.700 --> 01:30:14.700]  It's definitely a huge passion of mine.
[01:30:17.700 --> 01:30:19.700]  Phil's got the stuff here.
[01:30:20.700 --> 01:30:21.700]  Psycho Bill is here.
[01:30:22.700 --> 01:30:23.700]  Now, see, I can get back here.
[01:30:23.700 --> 01:30:24.700]  Hang on just a second.
[01:30:24.700 --> 01:30:26.700]  Oh, so let me tell you the story of my dang name, brother.
[01:30:27.700 --> 01:30:28.700]  I'll tell you that chord first.
[01:30:28.700 --> 01:30:29.700]  Hang on.
[01:30:29.700 --> 01:30:30.700]  Sorry.
[01:30:30.700 --> 01:30:31.700]  Yeah, I'll tell you that chord.
[01:30:31.700 --> 01:30:32.700]  I'll tell you that chord.
[01:30:32.700 --> 01:30:33.700]  I'll tell you that chord.
[01:30:33.700 --> 01:30:34.700]  I'll tell you that chord first.
[01:30:34.700 --> 01:30:35.700]  Hang on.
[01:30:35.700 --> 01:30:36.700]  Sorry.
[01:30:36.700 --> 01:30:37.700]  Yeah, you got to show me that.
[01:30:37.700 --> 01:30:38.700]  So basically...
[01:30:38.700 --> 01:30:39.700]  Oh, so I make my E's cheap, too, man.
[01:30:40.700 --> 01:30:41.700]  I didn't know...
[01:30:41.700 --> 01:30:42.700]  I mean, I had no training.
[01:30:42.700 --> 01:30:43.700]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:30:43.700 --> 01:30:44.700]  I just did what you can.
[01:30:44.700 --> 01:30:45.700]  All right.
[01:30:45.700 --> 01:30:46.700]  So basically...
[01:30:47.700 --> 01:30:49.700]  I just hammer on my A's and stuff.
[01:30:49.700 --> 01:30:50.700]  I just, you know, kind of...
[01:30:51.700 --> 01:30:52.700]  You know what I'm talking about, man.
[01:30:52.700 --> 01:30:53.700]  All right.
[01:30:53.700 --> 01:30:56.700]  So if you was wondering what chord I was playing, that's the only reason why I was telling you.
[01:30:57.700 --> 01:30:58.700]  All right.
[01:30:58.700 --> 01:30:59.700]  People always ask.
[01:30:59.700 --> 01:31:00.700]  All right.
[01:31:00.700 --> 01:31:01.700]  So I hit the bass note, right?
[01:31:01.700 --> 01:31:02.700]  So pop it.
[01:31:03.700 --> 01:31:04.700]  And then you just...
[01:31:05.700 --> 01:31:06.700]  You know, that thing.
[01:31:07.700 --> 01:31:13.700]  But then, at the end, and this is how you make it sound like as a guitar, like you're
[01:31:13.700 --> 01:31:15.700]  actually finger picking some shit.
[01:31:15.700 --> 01:31:16.700]  You just pop this.
[01:31:17.700 --> 01:31:18.700]  So...
[01:31:24.700 --> 01:31:27.700]  Oh, and I guess I'm hitting a little doo-doo in the middle.
[01:31:31.700 --> 01:31:32.700]  That's it.
[01:31:37.700 --> 01:31:39.700]  We've got all kinds of feedback going on, boys.
[01:31:39.700 --> 01:31:40.700]  This is horrible.
[01:31:41.700 --> 01:31:44.700]  Yeah, your mic is way down.
[01:31:45.700 --> 01:31:46.700]  People want more Althea.
[01:31:46.700 --> 01:31:47.700]  Yeah, I know what I did.
[01:31:47.700 --> 01:31:48.700]  Now you're back.
[01:31:48.700 --> 01:31:50.700]  People are asking for more Althea.
[01:31:51.700 --> 01:31:52.700]  Oh, cool.
[01:31:52.700 --> 01:31:59.700]  Althea told me I was feeling down, lacking in some direction.
[01:32:00.700 --> 01:32:01.700]  Yeah, man.
[01:32:01.700 --> 01:32:02.700]  Oh, hell.
[01:32:02.700 --> 01:32:03.700]  Dude, we need to sing Thriller.
[01:32:03.700 --> 01:32:04.700]  Can you sing Thriller?
[01:32:04.700 --> 01:32:05.700]  Althea told me.
[01:32:05.700 --> 01:32:06.700]  What's that?
[01:32:06.700 --> 01:32:07.700]  Thriller?
[01:32:07.700 --> 01:32:08.700]  Michael Jackson?
[01:32:08.700 --> 01:32:09.700]  Yeah, it's October.
[01:32:10.700 --> 01:32:13.700]  Thriller is like the song for this time of year.
[01:32:14.700 --> 01:32:15.700]  I don't pay any attention.
[01:32:15.700 --> 01:32:16.700]  Hang on.
[01:32:16.700 --> 01:32:17.700]  That would be awesome, though, if I could.
[01:32:17.700 --> 01:32:18.700]  Let's make some music for these people.
[01:32:19.700 --> 01:32:21.700]  All right, I'd have to pull up the lyrics.
[01:32:21.700 --> 01:32:22.700]  I'm sure I could sing along.
[01:32:23.700 --> 01:32:24.700]  Oh, man, I don't know the lyrics.
[01:32:24.700 --> 01:32:25.700]  Shit.
[01:32:25.700 --> 01:32:26.700]  Come on, I'm faking it.
[01:32:26.700 --> 01:32:28.700]  We're going to do like one verse.
[01:32:28.700 --> 01:32:29.700]  You know how it works.
[01:32:30.700 --> 01:32:31.700]  Hang on, I'm just going to plug in my mic, guys.
[01:32:31.700 --> 01:32:32.700]  I'll come back.
[01:32:32.700 --> 01:32:33.700]  I promise.
[01:32:33.700 --> 01:32:34.700]  Hang on.
[01:32:36.700 --> 01:32:37.700]  I bet you can hear me.
[01:32:37.700 --> 01:32:38.700]  Give me a thumbs up, Pete.
[01:32:39.700 --> 01:32:40.700]  All right.
[01:32:41.700 --> 01:32:42.700]  See, is this a little better?
[01:32:42.700 --> 01:32:43.700]  It's a little better, isn't it?
[01:32:44.700 --> 01:32:45.700]  I know it is.
[01:32:45.700 --> 01:32:46.700]  Yeah.
[01:32:46.700 --> 01:32:47.700]  Sounds really good.
[01:32:47.700 --> 01:32:52.700]  I wish I could hear you guys right now, but then I wouldn't have to worry about interrupting you, I guess.
[01:32:53.700 --> 01:32:54.700]  I'm kidding.
[01:32:54.700 --> 01:32:55.700]  All right.
[01:32:56.700 --> 01:32:58.700]  Why did I even put in the mic?
[01:32:58.700 --> 01:32:59.700]  Oh, yeah, we're going to sing a song.
[01:33:00.700 --> 01:33:01.700]  All right.
[01:33:01.700 --> 01:33:02.700]  Hey, check out my reverb right here, buddy.
[01:33:02.700 --> 01:33:03.700]  Reverb.
[01:33:03.700 --> 01:33:04.700]  You see that?
[01:33:04.700 --> 01:33:05.700]  Hey, yeah, right?
[01:33:05.700 --> 01:33:06.700]  That's my banger.
[01:33:07.700 --> 01:33:08.700]  Is that a plug-in?
[01:33:09.700 --> 01:33:14.150]  Use less energy, people, please.
[01:33:15.150 --> 01:33:16.150]  All right.
[01:33:17.150 --> 01:33:18.150]  I don't need no pedal to do that.
[01:33:18.150 --> 01:33:19.150]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:33:20.150 --> 01:33:21.150]  I don't need no interface, guys.
[01:33:21.150 --> 01:33:22.150]  You can make it sound good without it.
[01:33:23.150 --> 01:33:24.150]  Look here.
[01:33:24.150 --> 01:33:25.150]  Look how good I sound right now.
[01:33:26.150 --> 01:33:27.150]  Don't you want me whispering to you like this?
[01:33:27.150 --> 01:33:28.150]  Come on.
[01:33:31.150 --> 01:33:32.150]  All right.
[01:33:32.150 --> 01:33:33.150]  What song was we going to play, though?
[01:33:33.150 --> 01:33:34.150]  Hell, hell, I'm going to have to unplug the mic just to remember.
[01:33:35.150 --> 01:33:36.150]  It's close to midnight.
[01:33:37.150 --> 01:33:38.150]  Let's see if I can read lips.
[01:33:39.150 --> 01:33:40.150]  It's something evil's lurking in the dark.
[01:33:41.150 --> 01:33:42.150]  Oh, it's Thriller.
[01:33:42.150 --> 01:33:43.150]  Hang on.
[01:33:43.150 --> 01:33:44.150]  Right there.
[01:33:44.150 --> 01:33:45.150]  I remember.
[01:33:46.150 --> 01:33:47.150]  You see a sight that almost stops your heart.
[01:33:48.150 --> 01:33:49.150]  It's in D minor, okay?
[01:33:52.150 --> 01:33:56.150]  And then the second half of the verse, I think I'm doing it in G or some shit.
[01:33:57.150 --> 01:34:01.150]  And then the chorus, I do Thriller's in D minor.
[01:34:02.150 --> 01:34:03.150]  It's close to midnight.
[01:34:04.150 --> 01:34:05.150]  Oh, man, I love that.
[01:34:05.150 --> 01:34:06.150]  It's close to midnight.
[01:34:07.150 --> 01:34:08.150]  It's something evil's lurking in the dark.
[01:34:09.150 --> 01:34:10.150]  Hang on a second, guys.
[01:34:11.150 --> 01:34:12.150]  I got to sing for a minute.
[01:34:13.150 --> 01:34:15.150]  You see a sight that almost stops your heart.
[01:34:16.150 --> 01:34:17.150]  It's close to midnight.
[01:34:18.150 --> 01:34:23.150]  Something evil's lurking on the ground.
[01:34:24.150 --> 01:34:28.150]  In the dark of the night.
[01:34:29.150 --> 01:34:33.150]  A sun from a distance.
[01:34:34.150 --> 01:34:37.150]  A star tries.
[01:34:38.150 --> 01:34:41.150]  But terror takes a stand.
[01:34:42.150 --> 01:34:43.150]  Before you make it.
[01:34:44.150 --> 01:34:47.150]  Try to scream.
[01:34:49.150 --> 01:34:52.150]  I don't know the lyrics you write.
[01:34:53.150 --> 01:34:54.150]  From here.
[01:34:55.150 --> 01:34:57.150]  You're paralyzed.
[01:35:00.150 --> 01:35:01.150]  Because it's Thriller.
[01:35:02.150 --> 01:35:03.150]  Let's have fun, man.
[01:35:04.150 --> 01:35:05.150]  Hey.
[01:35:06.150 --> 01:35:07.150]  No, man, it's not fun.
[01:35:08.150 --> 01:35:09.150]  I'm going to warm up the vocal before I try to reach that one.
[01:35:10.150 --> 01:35:11.150]  That was good, man.
[01:35:12.150 --> 01:35:13.150]  I think we could start a band or something.
[01:35:14.150 --> 01:35:15.150]  We'd probably be like.
[01:35:16.150 --> 01:35:17.150]  I like the freestyle.
[01:35:18.150 --> 01:35:19.150]  Be like top 40 or something pretty quick.
[01:35:20.150 --> 01:35:21.150]  Hey, man.
[01:35:22.150 --> 01:35:23.150]  Shit.
[01:35:24.150 --> 01:35:25.150]  Dream's always alive.
[01:35:26.150 --> 01:35:28.150]  Let's sing some country music for these people.
[01:35:29.150 --> 01:35:30.150]  How about it?
[01:35:31.150 --> 01:35:32.150]  Hang on.
[01:35:32.150 --> 01:35:33.150]  Let me put them on my.
[01:35:34.150 --> 01:35:36.150]  Let me sing you some songs, man.
[01:35:37.150 --> 01:35:38.150]  Just let me sing you some songs.
[01:35:39.150 --> 01:35:40.150]  Just let me.
[01:35:41.150 --> 01:35:42.150]  Oh, man.
[01:35:43.150 --> 01:35:44.150]  Watch me relax.
[01:35:45.150 --> 01:35:46.150]  It's fun.
[01:35:47.150 --> 01:35:48.150]  I promise.
[01:35:49.150 --> 01:35:53.420]  It may not be good to hear, but it's fun to watch.
[01:35:53.420 --> 01:35:54.420]  I'm going to put some songs for you.
[01:35:55.420 --> 01:35:56.420]  I think if I can remember.
[01:35:57.420 --> 01:35:58.420]  Hang on.
[01:35:59.420 --> 01:36:00.420]  Oh, shit.
[01:36:01.420 --> 01:36:02.420]  Save the matches.
[01:36:03.420 --> 01:36:04.420]  That's what we say back home.
[01:36:07.650 --> 01:36:08.650]  You know, shit, fire and save the matches.
[01:36:09.650 --> 01:36:10.650]  Give me thumbs up before.
[01:36:11.650 --> 01:36:12.650]  OK, Pete.
[01:36:13.650 --> 01:36:14.650]  All right, buddy.
[01:36:15.650 --> 01:36:17.650]  I like to treat it like you can be my ground guide, homie.
[01:36:18.650 --> 01:36:20.650]  And if I can't see you, I'm just going to assume that I need to
[01:36:21.650 --> 01:36:23.650]  stop driving because I don't want to run you over, man.
[01:36:24.650 --> 01:36:25.650]  I got to plug in my phone.
[01:36:26.650 --> 01:36:27.650]  I forgot I put it on charger.
[01:36:28.650 --> 01:36:31.650]  This is what happened the night my phone almost melted.
[01:36:32.650 --> 01:36:33.650]  You know, because of it, I didn't charge it.
[01:36:36.650 --> 01:36:37.650]  Hey, guys.
[01:36:41.050 --> 01:36:43.050]  Start to scream.
[01:36:44.050 --> 01:36:45.050]  And that's how it takes.
[01:36:46.050 --> 01:36:47.050]  It's a for you.
[01:36:47.050 --> 01:36:48.050]  Make it.
[01:36:50.050 --> 01:36:51.050]  Man, I wish I could hear you.
[01:36:52.050 --> 01:36:53.050]  I'm going to plug it to find the song, OK?
[01:36:56.050 --> 01:36:57.050]  All right.
[01:36:57.050 --> 01:36:58.050]  Are we good?
[01:36:58.050 --> 01:36:59.050]  Case in Pete.
[01:37:00.050 --> 01:37:01.050]  Can you hear me?
[01:37:01.050 --> 01:37:03.050]  Yeah, because I can stay in here and kind of play a little bit.
[01:37:04.050 --> 01:37:05.050]  I move these.
[01:37:05.050 --> 01:37:06.050]  I look at this, do this is cool.
[01:37:07.050 --> 01:37:08.050]  I go to Goodwill, man, and I buy his old records.
[01:37:09.050 --> 01:37:10.050]  I know I was going to buy them, guys.
[01:37:11.050 --> 01:37:12.050]  Come on.
[01:37:13.050 --> 01:37:14.050]  And I cut them into big cards.
[01:37:15.050 --> 01:37:16.050]  Man, it's great.
[01:37:16.050 --> 01:37:17.050]  And I got a little template, dude.
[01:37:18.050 --> 01:37:19.050]  And you can make these at home, guys.
[01:37:19.050 --> 01:37:20.050]  I'm going to be doing tutorials all day.
[01:37:21.050 --> 01:37:22.050]  All right.
[01:37:22.050 --> 01:37:23.050]  Anyways.
[01:37:24.050 --> 01:37:25.050]  That's a sweet idea.
[01:37:26.050 --> 01:37:27.050]  Oh, dude, you know, it's what I'm talking about.
[01:37:28.050 --> 01:37:31.050]  See, people throwing away these radios and these radios inside of them.
[01:37:32.050 --> 01:37:35.050]  You know, it's in them the same damn tubes, transformers, speakers,
[01:37:36.050 --> 01:37:38.050]  everything that was in a nineteen fifty five basement.
[01:37:39.050 --> 01:37:40.050]  It cost one hundred thousand dollars or whatever.
[01:37:41.050 --> 01:37:42.050]  You know, I'm talking about same makers, man.
[01:37:43.050 --> 01:37:44.050]  Yeah, they didn't make it.
[01:37:45.050 --> 01:37:46.050]  They didn't make the diodes in the pots.
[01:37:46.050 --> 01:37:47.050]  They didn't make them proprietary for those amps.
[01:37:48.050 --> 01:37:49.050]  They were used in all electronics.
[01:37:50.050 --> 01:37:51.050]  It was just a time frame.
[01:37:52.050 --> 01:37:53.050]  I look here.
[01:37:53.050 --> 01:37:54.050]  I've got some used them.
[01:37:55.050 --> 01:37:56.050]  I've got in a bag in here.
[01:37:57.050 --> 01:37:58.050]  I took apart.
[01:37:59.050 --> 01:38:00.050]  I buy a lot of organs.
[01:38:01.050 --> 01:38:02.050]  I mean, I love organs.
[01:38:03.050 --> 01:38:05.050]  Oh, my little my little donor organs.
[01:38:06.050 --> 01:38:07.050]  Anyways, don't tell nobody.
[01:38:08.050 --> 01:38:10.050]  Boys, organ owners get upset when you take apart organs for tubes,
[01:38:11.050 --> 01:38:12.050]  for guitar amps to.
[01:38:13.050 --> 01:38:14.050]  Oh, anyway.
[01:38:14.050 --> 01:38:16.050]  All right, man, are some good tubes.
[01:38:17.050 --> 01:38:18.050]  Transformers.
[01:38:19.050 --> 01:38:20.050]  Oh, God.
[01:38:21.050 --> 01:38:22.050]  Anyway, so.
[01:38:23.050 --> 01:38:25.050]  I don't even want to talk about this.
[01:38:26.050 --> 01:38:27.050]  Things are songs.
[01:38:28.050 --> 01:38:29.050]  Come on.
[01:38:29.050 --> 01:38:30.050]  I remember.
[01:38:30.050 --> 01:38:31.050]  Hey, you know, Tyler Childers, man.
[01:38:32.050 --> 01:38:33.050]  I bet you do.
[01:38:33.050 --> 01:38:34.050]  You look like you do.
[01:38:35.050 --> 01:38:36.050]  That's stereotyping yet.
[01:38:37.050 --> 01:38:38.050]  How dare you?
[01:38:39.050 --> 01:38:40.050]  I don't know who you're talking about, though.
[01:38:41.050 --> 01:38:42.050]  You don't know what I'm talking about.
[01:38:42.050 --> 01:38:43.050]  No, no clue.
[01:38:44.050 --> 01:38:45.050]  What the fuck?
[01:38:45.050 --> 01:38:46.050]  Get out.
[01:38:46.050 --> 01:38:47.050]  Say the name again.
[01:38:47.050 --> 01:38:48.050]  Tyler Childers.
[01:38:49.050 --> 01:38:51.050]  Tyler, you know, I'm I'm so out of the world, man.
[01:38:52.050 --> 01:38:53.050]  I'm a hermit in the woods.
[01:38:54.050 --> 01:38:55.050]  I live up here under my rock.
[01:38:56.050 --> 01:38:57.050]  Every once in a while I crawl out and somebody tells me.
[01:38:58.050 --> 01:39:01.050]  I'm glad to be the one that's going to introduce you to this music, man.
[01:39:02.050 --> 01:39:03.050]  I'm loving this right now.
[01:39:03.050 --> 01:39:04.050]  I love hearing new music, though.
[01:39:04.050 --> 01:39:05.050]  So I'll.
[01:39:06.050 --> 01:39:07.050]  Oh, yeah.
[01:39:13.050 --> 01:39:15.050]  I think this is probably better, honestly, because my guitar is loud.
[01:39:16.050 --> 01:39:17.050]  But is that better?
[01:39:18.050 --> 01:39:19.050]  All right.
[01:39:20.050 --> 01:39:21.050]  Well, my guitar ain't I am I guess.
[01:39:23.050 --> 01:39:24.050]  I can do this.
[01:39:26.050 --> 01:39:27.050]  Whenever I want to get soft.
[01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:37.800]  Early in the morning when the sun does rise.
[01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:43.800]  Lake, Lake, Lake.
[01:39:45.800 --> 01:39:47.800]  I get to damn good on that first line.
[01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:49.800]  Late in the evening when the sun sinks low.
[01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:55.800]  That's about the time I rooster crow.
[01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:02.800]  I've got women up and down this creek.
[01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:08.800]  Keep me running in my engine clean.
[01:40:09.800 --> 01:40:10.800]  Run me raggy but I don't fret.
[01:40:15.800 --> 01:40:16.800]  Cause I ain't found one slowly down none yet.
[01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:23.800]  Get me drinking in moonshine.
[01:40:25.800 --> 01:40:26.800]  Get me high in the grocery bin.
[01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:29.800]  Take my trouble to the high wall.
[01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:31.800]  The road is long and the road is long.
[01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:33.800]  I'm a hermit in the woods.
[01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:35.800]  I live up here under my rock.
[01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:37.800]  I live up here under my rock.
[01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:39.800]  I live up here under my rock.
[01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:41.800]  When I wake up I could be swimming in the river.
[01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:43.800]  Let's take a boat and go home in the river and get your.
[01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:47.800]  We've been sniffing at cocaine.
[01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:49.800]  Ain't nothing better when the wind cuts cold.
[01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:51.800]  Lord it's a mind heart living but a damn good feeling
[01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:53.800]  to run these roads.
[01:40:58.800 --> 01:40:59.800]  Damn good feeling to run them roads.
[01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:01.800]  Hey, listen, you know after I sing that song.

[01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:05.800]  We run roads.
[01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:13.680]  roads we drive a lot unnecessarily might I add people all right but anyways
[01:41:17.800 --> 01:41:22.740]  what am I hearing that that that that was picking up the audio through someone

[01:44:15.260 --> 01:44:18.740]  funny of all of his songs that's the one that stuck with me after listening
[01:44:18.740 --> 01:44:24.980]  to the chess sessions which was like 40 I believe songs on that session and all
[01:44:24.980 --> 01:44:28.420]  of his classics were on there but that one man there was something about it ah
[01:44:28.420 --> 01:44:33.900]  the way it was recorded I think I you know you ever listened to the opening
[01:44:33.900 --> 01:44:39.700]  lines of and this is a canny song I know but something to be said for the White
[01:44:39.700 --> 01:44:48.940]  Stripes okay on elephant the opening bass lines of the famous song seven
[01:44:48.940 --> 01:44:54.460]  nation army right you can hear the snare drum springs from the bass line you can
[01:44:54.460 --> 01:44:58.060]  hear you know what I'm talking about yeah they might did underneath the snare
[01:44:58.060 --> 01:45:03.940]  probably as well it's like hearing the guitar strings you know I'm talking about
[01:45:03.940 --> 01:45:11.940]  I've never been that talented with it but it's always been something that I
[01:45:11.940 --> 01:45:16.580]  figured I'd work on now that I have more time is the you know you see people with
[01:45:16.580 --> 01:45:20.300]  acoustics they'll actually even cut the hole in the top so it projects back to
[01:45:20.300 --> 01:45:25.580]  him and they tap it all crazy Michael Hedges and Justin King's another good
[01:45:25.580 --> 01:45:32.220]  one there's the I'm trying to remember the guy Phil Cagney's got the missing
[01:45:32.220 --> 01:45:37.580]  finger Phil Cagney's amazing don't you dare not talk about John Gomm and that
[01:45:37.580 --> 01:45:42.260]  damn passion fruit song that drop keeps me awake at night damn that guy I hate
[01:45:42.260 --> 01:45:48.100]  him oh man he's as bad as John Mayer and that stupid neon song yeah that that one
[01:45:48.100 --> 01:45:53.980]  really twisted my mind too that was amazing man you try hey I'm a finger
[01:45:53.980 --> 01:45:58.260]  picker man I mean honestly that's my natural habitat on a guitar you know I'm
[01:45:58.260 --> 01:46:05.940]  kind of like what so oh man oh god I love Fleetwood Mac and Lindsey Buckingham
[01:46:05.940 --> 01:46:11.060]  Lindsey Buckingham's hand picker you know cuz he's a banjo I think we all
[01:46:11.060 --> 01:46:17.580]  have something like that in us where it's a little bit more intuitive to you
[01:46:17.580 --> 01:46:22.900]  because that's your gift or whatever but John Mayer you know all these artists
[01:46:22.900 --> 01:46:26.740]  we're talking about when they bring out something like that that's so unique
[01:46:26.740 --> 01:46:29.900]  like that neon where the chord structure and the and the picking and
[01:46:29.900 --> 01:46:33.700]  at the timing is just it blows your mind but to them you see him play and it's
[01:46:33.700 --> 01:46:39.020]  like they're doing in their sleep that's something I think we all have in us we
[01:46:39.020 --> 01:46:41.980]  just have to look for it but you just got to find the one you could you got to
[01:46:41.980 --> 01:46:48.860]  find okay so when I first started to play guitar all I learned all I knew my
[01:46:48.860 --> 01:46:53.460]  buddy Jared showed me like a D chord buddy Jared I hope you watching buddy
[01:46:53.460 --> 01:46:57.860]  man you know you got me started I love you buddy hey look here Jared had a
[01:46:57.860 --> 01:47:01.660]  beautiful little Fender guitar and I'm sure he still got it Jared takes good
[01:47:01.660 --> 01:47:05.820]  care of his stuff except for his trucks and we was in high school boys anyways
[01:47:05.820 --> 01:47:13.860]  all right look but he he showed me he showed me the D chord hey hey if Jared's
[01:47:13.860 --> 01:47:22.420]  mom's watching anyway or his dad good lord all right look at you make a D chord
[01:47:22.420 --> 01:47:26.740]  for instance let's say this is oh it's old guitar I would tell you oh man I got
[01:47:26.740 --> 01:47:30.380]  stories of the good bong story this one right here this man right here y'all
[01:47:30.380 --> 01:47:36.020]  need to look him up what's the name Reggie Reggie mark oh man you talk about
[01:47:36.020 --> 01:47:40.820]  talented dude he's I mean I have to give you a little segue he's a customer of
[01:47:40.820 --> 01:47:46.820]  mine too so you know I'm a little biased of course but man he's good he put he
[01:47:46.820 --> 01:47:53.940]  spelled his name with a R E J it's a gotta J now R E J I great great show you
[01:47:53.940 --> 01:47:57.860]  the D chord huh yeah what no oh yeah he showed me the D chord and that's all
[01:47:57.860 --> 01:48:02.020]  really new and so what I was doing cuz I'm you know I'm clever is I just
[01:48:02.020 --> 01:48:05.940]  started picking like little ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding
[01:48:05.940 --> 01:48:09.900]  ding ding ding ding ding and then I started oh hey look here I can just lift
[01:48:09.900 --> 01:48:14.580]  up one finger and it changes everything you know the whole game that's how I
[01:48:14.580 --> 01:48:18.740]  learned how to play guitar guys magic I was gonna show you this guitar though

[01:48:33.180 --> 01:48:37.780]  bracing and there was a bunch of those artists that would just put holes all
[01:48:37.780 --> 01:48:48.380]  over the guitar trying to see how it project yeah I love it I love guitar

[01:51:52.490 --> 01:51:56.610]  so it was just it was just to challenge myself honestly I had never built
[01:51:56.610 --> 01:52:01.290]  anything with no real fasteners and I cheated you know I put some fasteners in
[01:52:01.290 --> 01:52:06.450]  there cuz this table weighs about eight nine thousand pounds yeah so anyways but
[01:52:06.450 --> 01:52:10.370]  hey look you got a lot of equipment though appropriate for building guitars
[01:52:10.370 --> 01:52:16.450]  for not doing it that long you know I've got I've got people that seen I think
[01:52:16.450 --> 01:52:20.850]  maybe some potential and they and they and they and they felt sorry for me they
[01:52:20.850 --> 01:52:25.770]  gave me shit man this right here came from man Mike Mike the luthier Mike
[01:52:25.770 --> 01:52:30.650]  Daly on Instagram daily luthier I think he built me a guitar Christmas my friend
[01:52:30.650 --> 01:52:35.010]  I know Mike Daly and I can't even tell you why but I was in the industry so
[01:52:35.010 --> 01:52:38.810]  long that name is I mean I should remember him from I should remember
[01:52:38.810 --> 01:52:43.010]  where I know him from but he's not he's you know he's not he's not an older guy
[01:52:43.010 --> 01:52:47.650]  he's a young young guy I mean he's I mean ain't that young guy in the 30s but
[01:52:47.650 --> 01:52:51.850]  was he you know from Seattle where he is he went to school okay and he went to
[01:52:51.850 --> 01:52:56.010]  school so he went to real luthier school so let's go back to that
[01:52:56.010 --> 01:53:00.330]  Stevenson guitars that's Mike Daly Stevenson or he I met him through
[01:53:00.330 --> 01:53:05.850]  Stevenson guitars which I was at the Kirkland musicians friend back in oh 99
[01:53:05.850 --> 01:53:11.970]  or something oh no I might not have been him then no yeah yeah he's a young young
[01:53:11.970 --> 01:53:15.250]  man man I mean he's young in the industry I'd say if you're gonna if
[01:53:15.250 --> 01:53:19.810]  you're gonna even call guys like us in the industry at all really you know Mike
[01:53:19.810 --> 01:53:24.450]  Daly maybe it's another Mike Daly yeah I'm sorry brother I'm like totally
[01:53:24.450 --> 01:53:28.850]  sidetracked hey this is a amp I built for max look here man look at this
[01:53:28.850 --> 01:53:32.330]  beautiful amp he found this in a trash behind his all right let me tell you
[01:53:32.330 --> 01:53:35.410]  about this odds I would have guessed Seattle though that has to be synchron
[01:53:35.410 --> 01:53:38.730]  is it synchronicity then because I'm telling you I knew a Mike Daly that's

[01:54:53.810 --> 01:54:57.210]  there's no empowerment without communication and we have to create
[01:54:57.210 --> 01:55:02.050]  spaces for that whenever we can even if it's a difficult to do so like

[02:00:21.790 --> 02:00:37.790]  I gotta plug back in my phone. You had some people singing along in the comments. That was an awesome song. I hope so people. I hope you're singing along every night. Those are hard lyrics to remember. A lot of lyrics there.
[02:00:37.790 --> 02:00:42.750]  You know that's one of the first for me I said in my stream the other night I said I used to place a lot of
[02:00:42.750 --> 02:00:46.110]  value in learning lyrics for people you know because honestly if you can't listen
[02:00:46.110 --> 02:00:50.950]  to me saying hell I might as well but you know I just didn't get my best
[02:00:50.950 --> 02:00:55.670]  performances in those restrained environments honestly and you know hey
[02:00:55.670 --> 02:01:03.030]  man look at you now. I love how you can say everything you want to in a song
[02:01:03.030 --> 02:01:07.430]  that otherwise you know you might not be able to but because it's in a song
[02:01:07.430 --> 02:01:12.030]  everybody listens to it and they love it you know so you can really just it's
[02:01:12.030 --> 02:01:16.710]  it's just such a great catalyst for bringing messages. I don't think either
[02:01:16.710 --> 02:01:26.470]  side can miss the humor of our current situation. I've got to take my dog out so I'm gonna
[02:01:26.470 --> 02:01:33.710]  pee but it's been a pleasure listening to live music. Nice to meet you Mia.
[02:01:33.710 --> 02:01:38.510]  Nice to meet the both of you too and thank you everyone in the chat for
[02:01:38.510 --> 02:01:43.230]  hanging out with us this evening. I will I'll be back on Future Canvas Project

[02:01:57.030 --> 02:01:59.030]  No no it was the best.
[02:01:59.030 --> 02:02:04.030]  Let's do it with the two of you. This is the home stretch. Why don't each of you do a song?
[02:02:04.030 --> 02:02:07.030]  Yes I want to hear you play man.
[02:02:07.550 --> 02:02:11.550]  We'll wrap at midnight. We got 15 minutes to go.

[02:02:21.550 --> 02:02:23.550]  Shit.
[02:02:25.550 --> 02:02:28.550]  So what direction are you guys gonna go in?
[02:02:28.550 --> 02:02:30.550]  I want him to go first I know that.
[02:02:30.550 --> 02:02:31.550]  Yeah.
[02:02:31.550 --> 02:02:35.950]  I mean here's the thing I'm not really prepared so I sound like shit with my
[02:02:35.950 --> 02:02:39.030]  crappy guitar going directly and you know we were talking about Tome with
[02:02:39.030 --> 02:02:44.990]  tube amps and it sounds so digital so I'm not even very inspired like to play
[02:02:44.990 --> 02:02:48.390]  and I don't want to ruin the vibe and you're so good I would rather give you
[02:02:48.390 --> 02:02:52.430]  the stage back seriously you're an awesome artist and the stuff that's I
[02:02:52.430 --> 02:02:57.790]  like to play but I'm just actually and to be honest I haven't I've been pretty
[02:02:57.790 --> 02:03:01.070]  sick for the last week not to bring it bring a downer but the whole like the
[02:03:01.070 --> 02:03:03.590]  fires and all that stuff I was telling you about I had headaches and all that so
[02:03:03.630 --> 02:03:07.750]  you know I mean I just came on because you guys were talking music and I love
[02:03:07.750 --> 02:03:12.550]  cannabis love music figured I'd share a moment with y'all but it's getting late
[02:03:12.550 --> 02:03:14.990]  for me and I'm gonna have to go to bed here pretty quick but I want to listen
[02:03:14.990 --> 02:03:17.670]  to you play another song I'll play a lead if you want to give me a spot in there
[02:03:17.670 --> 02:03:22.030]  I'll try to jam a little thing along with it you know I'll try I'll try you
[02:03:22.030 --> 02:03:25.790]  know I don't need a key and give me a space in there and I'll put a little
[02:03:25.790 --> 02:03:28.790]  lead in. I'm trying to think of a song.
[02:03:28.790 --> 02:03:30.790]  Man give me the chord progression.
[02:03:30.790 --> 02:03:35.150]  You know what let's do this Pete look here I can do requests pretty
[02:03:35.150 --> 02:03:39.790]  decently pretty off the cuff usually if you especially if you go by band and
[02:03:39.790 --> 02:03:46.510]  especially if you go by classic rock band come on I'm a dad so if somebody's
[02:03:46.510 --> 02:03:48.510]  got one man I'm glad to do it.
[02:03:48.510 --> 02:03:55.460]  You like like old Jimi Hendrix tunes all along the
[02:03:55.460 --> 02:03:58.460]  watchtower something or you know.
[02:03:58.460 --> 02:04:01.500]  Hey I mean hey you want to do some
[02:04:01.500 --> 02:04:07.500]  pentatonic jams in E that nobody else wants to listen to we can do that.
[02:04:07.500 --> 02:04:13.580]  If you do them right listen to Country Gravy Bear that guy I was listening to him that's why I
[02:04:13.580 --> 02:04:16.420]  got it in my mind because he had the best jam the other night it was like a
[02:04:16.420 --> 02:04:20.540]  four-hour frickin actually he's just Country Gravy now he's on YouTube and D
[02:04:20.540 --> 02:04:24.460]  Live but this guy tore it up for four hours straight and did every single
[02:04:24.460 --> 02:04:29.500]  Jimi Hendrix tune and did it you know on a level that I don't know it's just
[02:04:29.500 --> 02:04:32.500]  exciting when you see people channel that kind of energy you know.
[02:04:32.500 --> 02:04:36.820]  There's a kid oh man there's so many people on YouTube that honestly embarrass me
[02:04:36.820 --> 02:04:42.100]  John Gomm I mean dude in terms and because if you know if you're measuring
[02:04:42.100 --> 02:04:45.980]  it in terms of talent right one real talented dude still ain't worth two
[02:04:45.980 --> 02:04:52.540]  decently you know what I mean so you know in terms of talent on YouTube dude
[02:04:52.540 --> 02:04:57.260]  man there is so much talent on YouTube it's insane I honestly I don't even
[02:04:57.260 --> 02:05:01.340]  listen to music I just go to YouTube and I type in the song I want I listen
[02:05:01.340 --> 02:05:05.260]  to people sing it man and people do amazing amazing.
[02:05:05.260 --> 02:05:12.180]  I'm trying to remember the name of this Nashville guy I'm sure you know Johnny
[02:05:12.180 --> 02:05:15.260]  Highland you ever heard of him?
[02:05:15.260 --> 02:05:19.260]  I don't think man because we need to exchange music.
[02:05:19.260 --> 02:05:24.420]  Let me just tell you real quick Johnny Highland is he's blind so you can't see
[02:05:24.420 --> 02:05:29.500]  the guitar and he's this dude that will get up and he only plays a telly and
[02:05:29.500 --> 02:05:34.180]  he's Nashville the whole way like he's just the most chicken-picking gristle
[02:05:34.180 --> 02:05:35.420]  and I mean.
[02:05:35.420 --> 02:05:38.420]  Wait to hear my brother Max play.
[02:05:38.420 --> 02:05:41.420]  He just blows my mind man you got to check Johnny Highland.
[02:05:41.420 --> 02:05:45.420]  I will I will I'm gonna write it down actually hey hang on let's got a pen
[02:05:45.420 --> 02:05:47.420]  Stoner Garage gotta have a pen.
[02:05:47.420 --> 02:05:52.420]  I'll tell you three guitar players that if you haven't you probably may not know Greg
[02:05:52.420 --> 02:05:56.420]  Cocke the Cocke Greg Cocke.
[02:05:56.420 --> 02:05:58.420]  I mean I know some Cocke's.
[02:05:58.420 --> 02:06:06.420]  He's like a Sasquatch he's six foot eight guy is like the guitar just looks like
[02:06:06.420 --> 02:06:12.420]  little teeny I guess scaled toy or something in his hands but he's got so much
[02:06:12.420 --> 02:06:16.420]  strength that when he rips into reminds me of Stevie because the way he bends
[02:06:16.420 --> 02:06:21.420]  those notes and does the octave kind of pitch shift and stuff and he chicken
[02:06:21.420 --> 02:06:24.420]  picks Jimi Hendrix too that's the other thing.
[02:06:24.420 --> 02:06:28.420]  I mean yeah I think whenever I play it I usually finger pick it.
[02:06:28.420 --> 02:06:29.420]  That's funny.
[02:06:29.420 --> 02:06:31.420]  It's good stuff.
[02:06:31.420 --> 02:06:33.420]  Yeah I'd like it out brother.
[02:06:33.420 --> 02:06:34.420]  I'll just sit in the back.
[02:06:34.420 --> 02:06:36.420]  There's a moment I'll jam in.
[02:06:36.420 --> 02:06:40.420]  Well I was gonna tell you though there's a guy I mean I didn't even pick the song
[02:06:40.420 --> 02:06:43.420]  man but there's a guy out there on YouTube and he does Jimi Hendrix acoustic
[02:06:43.420 --> 02:06:47.420]  cover he does one of them and he does Michael Jackson acoustic cover oh man oh
[02:06:47.420 --> 02:06:56.420]  my gosh this guy is really really he's a very thin man and he sits and just man
[02:06:56.420 --> 02:07:02.420]  whales I mean he plays a killer acoustic finger pick part sings perfect and then
[02:07:02.420 --> 02:07:04.420]  finger picks an amazing solo.
[02:07:04.420 --> 02:07:08.420]  I mean it's like a performance every time and he does amazing covers and I can't
[02:07:08.420 --> 02:07:12.420]  remember the guy's name man you Google Jimi Hendrix acoustic cover though and
[02:07:12.420 --> 02:07:15.420]  I'll probably be the one that hopefully it'll be the one that comes up because
[02:07:15.420 --> 02:07:17.420]  it's the best one I've seen.
[02:07:17.420 --> 02:07:18.420]  Anyway.
[02:07:18.420 --> 02:07:19.420]  We'll check it out.
[02:07:19.420 --> 02:07:20.420]  Hey man.
[02:07:20.420 --> 02:07:21.420]  Coming in?
[02:07:21.420 --> 02:07:22.420]  Oh I hear something.
[02:07:22.420 --> 02:07:23.420]  I think we're just gonna be in.
[02:07:47.140 --> 02:08:47.560]  I don't know.
[02:08:47.560 --> 02:08:52.560]  Yeah I do the Jimi Hendrix acoustic but.
[02:08:52.560 --> 02:08:56.560]  I wonder if when I play if the like the noise gates going to kick in.
[02:08:56.560 --> 02:08:57.560]  Oh it's horrible.
[02:08:57.560 --> 02:09:01.560]  I'm sure when we play if we play at the same time there's I don't know if they'll
[02:09:01.560 --> 02:09:04.560]  be latency but the noise gate is the thing I'm thinking is going to.
[02:09:04.560 --> 02:09:09.560]  Oh that's definitely gonna be like one of us come through.
[02:09:09.560 --> 02:09:10.560]  I don't know.
[02:09:10.560 --> 02:09:13.560]  Hell I don't you know honestly I don't know there may not be latency.
[02:09:13.560 --> 02:09:17.560]  Pete would have to be the judge and judge and judge you should be able to be because
[02:09:17.560 --> 02:09:22.520]  to me because you know honestly he was a DJ for many years he said.
[02:09:22.520 --> 02:09:33.560]  I'm tuning back into the conversation. Yeah right. I know I'm just trying to bring you
[02:09:33.560 --> 02:09:36.040]  back buddy.
[02:09:36.040 --> 02:09:51.280]  We were asking if I play am I actually hearing him at the same time so are we you know what
[02:09:51.280 --> 02:09:56.560]  I'm saying are we getting time. So hang on let me play a standard old regular old shuffle
[02:09:56.560 --> 02:10:19.140]  here and then you try and get in on it.
[02:10:19.140 --> 02:10:36.380]  I think Pete can hear us both. I can hear both of you.
[02:10:36.380 --> 02:10:49.780]  Smoke that guitar boys smoke that guitar. There you go.
[02:10:49.780 --> 02:11:07.060]  Is he playing rhythm now? You got the electric. I'm playing rhythm man you laid it out.
[02:33:50.360 --> 02:33:51.360]  Yeah.
[02:33:51.360 --> 02:33:52.360]  Oh this morning baby.
[02:33:52.360 --> 02:33:53.360]  I'm feeling so good.
[02:33:53.360 --> 02:33:54.360]  I'm feeling so good.
[02:33:54.360 --> 02:33:55.360]  I'm feeling so good.
[02:33:55.600 --> 02:33:56.600]  the guitar guy is.
[02:33:56.600 --> 02:34:01.280]  Whenever I was in high school there was this guy called trick daddy. My friend used to
[02:34:01.280 --> 02:34:04.940]  listen to him. I kinda liked him he was pretty good. I mean honestly none of that old rap
[02:34:04.940 --> 02:34:11.120]  would I advocate anymore man I'm sorry I can't. Anyways I don't know.
[02:34:11.120 --> 02:34:18.000]  Man these guys have got kids Pete. It's warping my views on things Pete. It's making me conservative.
[02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:19.000]  Oh God.
[02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:23.480]  You know what I mean, man?
[02:34:23.480 --> 02:34:24.680]  That's what it all is about.
[02:34:24.680 --> 02:34:27.240]  You know, just trying to protect your kids from somebody, I guess.
[02:34:27.240 --> 02:34:27.880]  I don't know.
[02:34:27.880 --> 02:34:33.200]  I don't understand why we're scared of each other, but damn sure we are, ain't we?
[02:34:33.200 --> 02:34:37.360]  Anyways, boys, let me sing you this T-Pain song.
[02:34:37.360 --> 02:34:38.680]  I ain't scared of him.
[02:34:38.680 --> 02:34:41.080]  I like him. Oh, yeah.
[02:34:41.080 --> 02:34:42.600]  He's my favorite. All right.
[02:34:42.600 --> 02:34:44.480]  Favorite artist. Here we go, boys.
[02:34:44.480 --> 02:34:53.610]  And this, you know, honestly, this is based on a classic country melody, you know, I think.
[02:34:53.610 --> 02:34:56.770]  There we go. Can you hear me?
[02:34:56.770 --> 02:35:05.950]  Give me some sweet sounds, Pete. All right.
[02:35:05.950 --> 02:35:09.350]  Baby girl, what's your name?
[02:35:09.350 --> 02:35:12.710]  Let me talk to you. Let me buy you a drink.
[02:35:12.710 --> 02:35:16.030]  I'm T-Pain. You love me.
[02:35:16.030 --> 02:35:19.350]  Come to the music, you bully.
[02:35:19.350 --> 02:35:20.950]  You're not a club.
[02:35:20.950 --> 02:35:22.630]  Closed at three.
[02:35:22.630 --> 02:35:25.790]  What's the chance of you rolling with me?
[02:35:25.790 --> 02:35:27.310]  Back to my crib.
[02:35:27.310 --> 02:35:28.990]  I'll show you how I live.
[02:35:28.990 --> 02:35:32.030]  Let's get drunk and forget what we did.
[02:35:32.030 --> 02:35:38.390]  We're gonna buy you a drink.
[02:35:38.390 --> 02:35:40.510]  I'm gonna take you home with me.
[02:35:40.510 --> 02:35:42.470]  I've got money in the bank.
[02:35:42.470 --> 02:35:44.750]  Shorty, what you know about this?
[02:35:44.750 --> 02:35:52.910]  You can find me in the creek, at a lake, in the bed light.
[02:35:52.910 --> 02:36:16.880]  Best line ever. Bed light.
[02:36:16.880 --> 02:36:24.120]  Anyways, yeah, we keep doing it, but I usually don't sing more than one verse of that because.
[02:36:24.120 --> 02:36:27.720]  He goes, what? I don't know the second verse.
[02:36:27.720 --> 02:36:30.720]  That that's a that's a good reason.
[02:36:30.720 --> 02:36:36.320]  Legitimate, right? Yeah, man.
[02:36:36.320 --> 02:36:38.520]  I'll play you a Sergeant Simpson song.
[02:36:38.520 --> 02:36:41.600]  Hang on, let's do it. Are you sure, brother?
[02:36:41.600 --> 02:36:43.440]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:36:43.440 --> 02:36:47.680]  And then and then I'll play and then I'll play that Teo Cruz song.
[02:36:47.680 --> 02:36:51.440]  Hang on just a second. Man, I love popular music.
[02:36:51.440 --> 02:36:54.240]  I think popular music is popular for a reason.
[02:36:54.240 --> 02:36:58.360]  Hang on now. Hold on to your hats. Newsflash. Hang on.
[02:36:58.360 --> 02:37:02.680]  All right. I'm gonna plug back in, buddy. Oh man.
[02:37:02.680 --> 02:37:10.840]  The weekend. God bless that guy. Oh man.
[02:37:10.960 --> 02:37:14.080]  Oh man. F sharp too.
[02:37:14.080 --> 02:37:18.560]  We're just getting warmed up Pete. Don't shut her down, son.
[02:37:18.560 --> 02:37:21.200]  Stay up all night. Make your wife mad with me.
[02:37:21.200 --> 02:37:26.360]  How mad can she get? You know, I'm still here.
[02:37:26.360 --> 02:37:32.860]  I can't hear you, brother. I hate it.
[02:37:32.860 --> 02:37:37.660]  I won't be around this old town anymore for a long, long time.
[02:37:37.660 --> 02:37:47.340]  I'm gonna take the road, start looking for the end of that long white line.
[02:37:47.340 --> 02:37:53.020]  I woke up, my baby was gone, but she went home.
[02:37:53.020 --> 02:37:57.700]  Gonna hit the road, start looking for the end of that long white line.
[02:37:57.700 --> 02:38:03.060]  Gonna hit the road, start looking for the end of that long white line.
[02:38:03.060 --> 02:38:08.180]  Went to the bank to get my dope, but I don't know.
[02:38:08.180 --> 02:38:13.180]  Hit that regular, push that girl right out of my mind.
[02:38:13.180 --> 02:38:16.860]  If somebody, fuck man, I'm fucking that song all up, boys.
[02:38:16.860 --> 02:38:21.540]  I tell you what, it deserves better. I'm sorry.
[02:38:21.540 --> 02:38:26.380]  If somebody wants to, wants to come with his soul and soul,
[02:38:26.380 --> 02:38:31.380]  just tell them I'm somewhere looking for the end of that long white line.
[02:38:31.380 --> 02:38:35.380]  Just tell them I'm somewhere looking for the end of this long white line.
[02:38:35.380 --> 02:38:47.020]  New York City, El San Joe, Albuquerque, New Mexico.
[02:38:47.020 --> 02:38:52.060]  This old ring, she's a running, she's a humming, she's a doing fine.
[02:38:52.060 --> 02:38:56.700]  If somebody wants to know what's become of this soul and soul,
[02:38:56.740 --> 02:39:03.540]  just tell them I'm somewhere looking for the end of this long white line.
[02:39:03.540 --> 02:39:11.140]  Ain't we all, boys? Let me go straight to the tail, I mean, why wouldn't I?
[02:39:11.140 --> 02:39:15.540]  If I can remember the goddamn chords, man, I mess this one up every time in my life.
[02:39:15.540 --> 02:39:26.540]  Oh, I sing this one loud. You're going to love this one.
[02:39:26.540 --> 02:39:34.380]  I came to dance, dance, dance, dance. I'm wearing all my favorite brands, brands, brands, brands.
[02:39:34.380 --> 02:39:40.500]  Pete, make room for my hands, hands, hands, hands.
[02:39:40.500 --> 02:39:49.460]  It goes on and on and on. It goes on and on and on.
[02:39:50.460 --> 02:39:59.460]  I throw my hands up in the air sometimes, singing, hey, oh, baby, let's go.
[02:39:59.460 --> 02:40:06.460]  I came to celebrate and live my life, singing, hey, oh, baby, let's go.
[02:40:06.460 --> 02:40:11.460]  Because I came to rock this town, came to rock it right.
[02:40:11.460 --> 02:40:20.460]  Gonna lay it up like it's dynamite. And I told you once, gonna tear you tight.
[02:40:20.460 --> 02:40:25.460]  Gonna lay it up like it's dynamite.
[02:40:25.460 --> 02:40:29.460]  Wait, do it again.
[02:40:33.460 --> 02:40:36.460]  Oh, man, I love these songs, Pete. Oh, this is what I wanted, brother.
[02:40:36.460 --> 02:40:40.460]  Let me roll the joint and fucking bop. Come on, man.
[02:40:40.460 --> 02:40:43.460]  All right. What songs? What songs? What songs?
[02:40:43.460 --> 02:40:45.460]  All right. So, so can you hear me?
[02:40:45.460 --> 02:40:48.460]  I know what songs I do best and I know them son bitches watching.
[02:40:48.460 --> 02:40:50.460]  Can you hear me?
[02:40:50.460 --> 02:40:55.460]  I won't plug it.
[02:40:55.460 --> 02:40:58.460]  Can you hear me?
[02:40:58.460 --> 02:40:59.460]  Yes, sir.
[02:40:59.460 --> 02:41:08.460]  So, so one of the dads in my daughter's preschool is Adam Levine, the lead singer of Maroon 5.
[02:41:08.460 --> 02:41:11.460]  Do you know any Maroon 5 songs?
[02:41:11.460 --> 02:41:15.460]  Dude, man, I wish I knew that damn girl song.
[02:41:15.460 --> 02:41:20.460]  I tell you what, I'm about to learn that girl song just for you, buddy, because I love that song.
[02:41:20.460 --> 02:41:22.460]  Hang on. And there's you know what, actually, you know what?
[02:41:22.460 --> 02:41:24.460]  I'm not going to do a cover of that song.
[02:41:24.460 --> 02:41:28.460]  There is an amazing cover of that song on YouTube by a guy.
[02:41:28.460 --> 02:41:31.460]  I don't even know his name, but he's wearing a boss, a ball cap.
[02:41:31.460 --> 02:41:34.460]  And he's wearing a blue jean shirt.
[02:41:34.460 --> 02:41:36.460]  Canadian, probably.
[02:41:36.460 --> 02:41:39.460]  Anyways, but man, he does a great cover of it.
[02:41:39.460 --> 02:41:41.460]  And I couldn't even get close to doing that cover.
[02:41:41.460 --> 02:41:43.460]  And I want him to get some damn views.
[02:41:43.460 --> 02:41:49.460]  So if you want to go see a good cover, an acoustic cover, that's going to be a hundred times better than I can do.
[02:41:49.460 --> 02:41:53.460]  Over there. Go look up acoustic cover of Girls, man.
[02:41:53.460 --> 02:41:55.460]  Oh, man, what a good song, man.
[02:41:55.460 --> 02:41:57.460]  That just relaxes the fuck out of me.
[02:41:57.460 --> 02:42:01.460]  I do like Adam Levine's voice, though, and his choice in clothes.
[02:42:01.460 --> 02:42:04.460]  I'm actually wearing an Adam Levine sweater.
[02:42:04.460 --> 02:42:06.460]  Don't tell nobody.
[02:42:06.460 --> 02:42:15.460]  All right. So I want to hear another, like a top 40 hit.
[02:42:15.460 --> 02:42:17.460]  Let me try and think, man.
[02:42:17.460 --> 02:42:22.460]  I love doing those with the songs, you know, like the, I don't know, man.
[02:42:22.460 --> 02:42:24.460]  Breaking the genres.
[02:42:24.460 --> 02:42:26.460]  Hey, I got one for you, buddy.
[02:42:26.460 --> 02:42:28.460]  Oh, this one's right up your alley.
[02:42:32.460 --> 02:42:35.460]  I won't let you down.
[02:42:35.460 --> 02:42:38.460]  Will not give you up.
[02:42:38.460 --> 02:42:41.460]  Gotta have some faith in the sound.
[02:42:41.460 --> 02:42:44.460]  It's the one good thing that I've got.
[02:42:44.460 --> 02:42:46.460]  Hang on, I got to plug in the mic, dog.
[02:42:46.460 --> 02:42:48.460]  Or is it just as good? Does it matter?
[02:42:48.460 --> 02:42:50.460]  I mean, honestly, you're drunk.
[02:42:50.460 --> 02:42:51.460]  It don't matter.
[02:42:51.460 --> 02:42:53.460]  Is that what you're talking about? I can't hear you right.
[02:42:53.460 --> 02:42:55.460]  I can hear you, Pete.
[02:42:55.460 --> 02:42:58.460]  Give me those mouth words.
[02:42:58.460 --> 02:43:00.460]  It's good. It's good.
[02:43:00.460 --> 02:43:01.460]  Awesome. Thank you.
[02:43:01.460 --> 02:43:03.460]  Hey, man, I can make a dude uncomfortable.
[02:43:03.460 --> 02:43:04.460]  Trust me.
[02:43:04.460 --> 02:43:06.460]  You don't want to play with me.
[02:43:06.460 --> 02:43:08.460]  That game they play in the army.
[02:43:08.460 --> 02:43:11.460]  Oh, man, I went all over it.
[02:43:11.460 --> 02:43:14.460]  And the guys that's been in the army know the game I'm talking about.
[02:43:14.460 --> 02:43:17.460]  Oh, man, I'm going to say it, though, because honestly, it's disrespectful,
[02:43:17.460 --> 02:43:19.460]  people aren't.
[02:43:19.460 --> 02:43:20.460]  All right.
[02:43:20.460 --> 02:43:27.460]  Oh, it's a top 40 from about talking about hell 60 years ago, probably.
[02:43:27.460 --> 02:43:30.460]  You can't get home if you're going by the mail.
[02:43:30.460 --> 02:43:33.460]  Bridge washed out at the bottom of the hill.
[02:43:33.460 --> 02:43:36.460]  Big creeks up and a little creek's level.
[02:43:36.460 --> 02:43:41.460]  Clown my corn with a double shovel.
[02:43:41.460 --> 02:43:43.460]  Stay all night, stay a little longer.
[02:43:43.460 --> 02:43:46.460]  Dance all night, dance a little longer.
[02:43:46.460 --> 02:43:49.460]  Take off your coat, throw it in the corner.
[02:43:49.460 --> 02:43:57.460]  I don't see why you won't stay a little longer.
[02:43:57.460 --> 02:44:00.460]  Well, you've been in the grasshopper eating ice cream.
[02:44:00.460 --> 02:44:01.460]  You got six.
[02:44:01.460 --> 02:44:02.460]  Oh, wait a minute.
[02:44:02.460 --> 02:44:03.460]  She loves.
[02:44:03.460 --> 02:44:05.460]  Stay all night, stay a little longer.
[02:44:05.460 --> 02:44:08.460]  Dance all night, dance a little longer.
[02:44:08.460 --> 02:44:11.460]  Take off your coat, throw it in the corner.
[02:44:11.460 --> 02:44:18.460]  I don't see why you won't stay a little longer.
[02:44:18.460 --> 02:44:21.460]  Well, you ought to see my blue-eyed Sally.
[02:44:21.460 --> 02:44:24.460]  She lives right down around Shinbone Alley.
[02:44:24.460 --> 02:44:27.460]  Number on the house is the number on the door.
[02:44:27.460 --> 02:44:32.460]  Next house over is the grocery store.
[02:44:32.460 --> 02:44:35.460]  Stay all night, stay a little longer.
[02:44:35.460 --> 02:44:38.460]  Dance all night, dance a little longer.
[02:44:38.460 --> 02:44:41.460]  Take off your coat, throw it in the corner.
[02:44:41.460 --> 02:44:45.460]  I don't see why you won't stay a little longer.
[02:44:45.460 --> 02:44:46.460]  Man, I love that song.
[02:44:46.460 --> 02:44:47.460]  I love that movie that came from.
[02:44:47.460 --> 02:44:48.460]  I stole it from a movie.
[02:44:48.460 --> 02:44:50.460]  You know the movie I'm talking about, don't you, Pete?
[02:44:50.460 --> 02:44:53.460]  Look at you, clever little media person, you.
[02:44:53.460 --> 02:44:55.460]  Heartworn Highways, you ever seen it?
[02:44:55.460 --> 02:44:56.460]  I love that song.
[02:44:56.460 --> 02:44:58.460]  I love that movie.
[02:44:58.460 --> 02:45:00.460]  I have not seen the movie.
[02:45:00.460 --> 02:45:03.460]  Shocked.
[02:45:03.460 --> 02:45:06.460]  You, you, you, man, I tell you what,
[02:45:06.460 --> 02:45:09.460]  you're confirming some stereotypes.
[02:45:09.460 --> 02:45:11.460]  I'm just kidding.
[02:45:11.460 --> 02:45:13.460]  No, seriously, man, it's a great movie, man.
[02:45:13.460 --> 02:45:14.460]  You got to watch it.
[02:45:14.460 --> 02:45:15.460]  But you know what?
[02:45:15.460 --> 02:45:17.460]  Man, there's an unfortunate character in it.
[02:45:17.460 --> 02:45:20.460]  There is.
[02:45:20.460 --> 02:45:26.460]  Man, anyways, you can fast forward through his ass.
[02:45:26.460 --> 02:45:31.460]  But I'm sure you know the country star I'm talking of from the 70s
[02:45:31.460 --> 02:45:34.460]  that honestly I ain't got no business with, boys.
[02:45:34.460 --> 02:45:38.460]  Hey, we ain't got nothing to say here.
[02:45:38.460 --> 02:45:41.460]  Hang on, let me plug back in this mic so I can't hear you, Pete.
[02:45:41.460 --> 02:45:43.460]  I'm going to play a good one.
[02:45:44.460 --> 02:45:45.460]  I'm going to play a good one.
[02:45:45.460 --> 02:45:46.460]  Hang on.
[02:45:46.460 --> 02:45:47.460]  Oh, you said top 40, though.
[02:45:47.460 --> 02:45:48.460]  Let me think.
[02:45:48.460 --> 02:45:50.460]  Let me be mindful here.
[02:45:50.460 --> 02:45:52.460]  What about like D on like 50 stuff?
[02:45:52.460 --> 02:45:53.460]  Is that okay?
[02:45:53.460 --> 02:45:55.460]  I mean, I can play a lot of good songs, man.
[02:45:55.460 --> 02:45:59.460]  You'll know most of them.
[02:45:59.460 --> 02:46:03.460]  I was doing that because I wanted to be cool, man.
[02:46:03.460 --> 02:46:05.460]  You know me.
[02:46:06.460 --> 02:46:08.460]  Oh.
[02:46:08.460 --> 02:46:10.460]  Oh.
[02:46:10.460 --> 02:46:14.180]  Oh.
[02:46:14.180 --> 02:46:16.180]  Oh.
[02:46:16.180 --> 02:46:18.180]  Oh.
[02:46:18.180 --> 02:46:20.180]  Oh.
[02:46:20.180 --> 02:46:21.180]  Oh.
[02:46:21.180 --> 02:46:22.180]  Hey, there it was.
[02:46:22.180 --> 02:46:24.180]  See, that's the problem.
[02:46:24.180 --> 02:46:35.180]  One of these days I'm going to have the testicular fortitude to bring my nice
[02:46:36.180 --> 02:46:40.180]  acoustic guitar out here in the garage.
[02:46:40.180 --> 02:46:43.180]  I tend not to bring nice things into the garage.
[02:46:43.180 --> 02:46:45.180]  Not because they get harmed.
[02:46:45.180 --> 02:46:49.180]  They get altered.
[02:46:49.180 --> 02:46:51.180]  Because we're all these little stoner engineers, aren't we?
[02:46:51.180 --> 02:46:53.180]  All right.
[02:46:53.180 --> 02:46:55.180]  Let me get my lyrics, too, man.
[02:46:55.180 --> 02:46:58.180]  Hell, I can sing one right for once.
[02:46:58.180 --> 02:47:01.180]  I got a whole bunch of lyrics for you, Pete.
[02:47:01.180 --> 02:47:03.180]  Oh, look here.
[02:47:04.180 --> 02:47:06.180]  Oh, here you go, top 40, baby.
[02:47:06.180 --> 02:47:13.900]  And I'm going to finger pick it.
[02:47:13.900 --> 02:47:17.900]  You know, honestly, I like finger picking songs, especially popular ones.
[02:47:17.900 --> 02:47:28.760]  Robert's got a quick hand.
[02:47:28.760 --> 02:47:32.760]  The looker in the room won't tell you his plan.
[02:47:32.760 --> 02:47:35.760]  He's got a rolled cigarette.
[02:47:36.760 --> 02:47:39.760]  He's got a gun.
[02:47:39.760 --> 02:47:41.760]  Hanging from his mouth.
[02:47:41.760 --> 02:47:44.760]  He's a cowboy kid.
[02:47:44.760 --> 02:47:47.760]  Found a six-shooter gun.
[02:47:47.760 --> 02:47:49.760]  In his dad's closet.
[02:47:49.760 --> 02:47:51.760]  Box of fun things.
[02:47:51.760 --> 02:47:54.760]  I don't even know what.
[02:47:54.760 --> 02:47:56.760]  But he's coming for you.
[02:47:56.760 --> 02:47:59.760]  He's coming for you.
[02:47:59.760 --> 02:48:02.760]  All the other kids with the pumped up kicks.
[02:48:03.760 --> 02:48:05.760]  You better run, better run.
[02:48:05.760 --> 02:48:08.760]  Faster than my bullet.
[02:48:08.760 --> 02:48:11.760]  Hell, man, that's a fucking sad song, man.
[02:48:11.760 --> 02:48:13.760]  I ain't never read them lyrics.
[02:48:13.760 --> 02:48:15.760]  God dang.
[02:48:15.760 --> 02:48:18.760]  It's a sad old world, boys.
[02:48:18.760 --> 02:48:23.760]  I'm about to have to sing you a sad song and make you cry just so we can get it over with.
[02:48:23.760 --> 02:48:25.760]  Hang on.
[02:48:25.760 --> 02:48:28.760]  It's just a matter of time until you see me cry, boys, I'm telling you now.
[02:48:29.760 --> 02:48:32.760]  When I start singing originals, it gets real close.
[02:48:32.760 --> 02:48:34.760]  I'll stop them.
[02:48:34.760 --> 02:48:36.760]  Hang on.
[02:48:36.760 --> 02:48:39.760]  Let's keep it light, though, today.
[02:48:39.760 --> 02:48:42.760]  I mean, it is our first date.
[02:48:42.760 --> 02:48:45.760]  With your feet in the air.
[02:48:45.760 --> 02:48:48.760]  Head on the ground.
[02:48:49.760 --> 02:48:51.760]  Try this trick.
[02:48:51.760 --> 02:49:00.520]  Now spin it.
[02:49:00.520 --> 02:49:03.520]  Your head will collapse.
[02:49:03.520 --> 02:49:06.520]  Until there's nothing in it.
[02:49:06.520 --> 02:49:11.520]  You'll ask yourself, you'll say, where is my mind?
[02:49:11.520 --> 02:49:14.520]  Where is my mind?
[02:49:14.520 --> 02:49:17.520]  Where is my mind?
[02:49:18.520 --> 02:49:21.520]  Where is my mind?
[02:49:21.520 --> 02:49:24.520]  Where is my mind?
[02:49:24.520 --> 02:49:27.520]  Where is my mind?
[02:49:27.520 --> 02:49:29.520]  Where is my mind?
[02:49:29.520 --> 02:49:35.460]  Where is my mind?
[02:49:35.460 --> 02:49:40.460]  Where is my mind?
[02:49:40.460 --> 02:49:47.460]  Well, I was swimming in the Caribbean.
[02:49:47.460 --> 02:49:52.460]  Except for little fish.
[02:49:52.460 --> 02:49:54.460]  He told me he swears.
[02:49:54.460 --> 02:49:58.460]  He said, where is my mind?
[02:49:58.460 --> 02:50:13.160]  Where is my mind?
[02:50:13.160 --> 02:50:21.480]  Move your feet in the air and your head on the ground.
[02:50:21.480 --> 02:50:24.480]  Try this trick.
[02:50:24.480 --> 02:50:28.480]  Spin it.
[02:50:28.480 --> 02:50:31.480]  Your head will collapse.
[02:50:31.480 --> 02:50:33.480]  So there's nothing in it.
[02:50:33.480 --> 02:50:43.480]  And you'll ask yourself, you'll say, where is my mind?
[02:50:43.480 --> 02:50:51.480]  Where is my mind?
[02:50:51.480 --> 02:50:55.480]  It's out there.
[02:50:55.480 --> 02:51:07.790]  I see it's swimming.
[02:51:07.790 --> 02:51:09.790]  Hey man, let's do some fucking psycho killer.
[02:51:09.790 --> 02:51:11.790]  Let's do this.
[02:51:11.790 --> 02:51:13.790]  Oh man, I love this song.
[02:51:13.790 --> 02:51:17.790]  It's like one of my favorite songs on earth.
[02:51:17.790 --> 02:51:25.790]  I want to put my head on the ground.
[02:51:25.790 --> 02:51:48.240]  I'm going to put my head on the ground and I'm going to put my head on the ground and I'm going to put my head into the microphone.
[02:51:48.240 --> 02:51:52.770]  Hang on a second, I'm trying to do this and I don't ever clip my guitar strings.
[02:51:52.770 --> 02:51:55.850]  Got on the ground, you don't need me.
[02:51:57.410 --> 02:52:00.670]  Try this trick and now spin it.
[02:52:00.670 --> 02:52:03.510]  ♪ Guitar playing ♪
[02:52:08.130 --> 02:52:08.970]  There we go.
[02:52:08.970 --> 02:52:10.170]  I don't have perfect pitch,
[02:52:10.170 --> 02:52:11.890]  but boys I've got relative pitch
[02:52:11.890 --> 02:52:13.930]  and I can tell when it's out.
[02:52:13.930 --> 02:52:16.130]  Any one musical can.
[02:52:16.130 --> 02:52:17.530]  Oh, it's horrible.
[02:52:17.530 --> 02:52:19.930]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
[02:52:19.930 --> 02:52:20.770]  All right.
[02:52:21.770 --> 02:52:22.610]  Here we go.
[02:52:23.490 --> 02:52:25.930]  Hey, hey, here's an interesting observation.
[02:52:25.930 --> 02:52:27.330]  Actually I'm gonna pause for just a second.
[02:52:27.330 --> 02:52:30.130]  I wanna tell you, I'm gonna talk to you Pete.
[02:52:30.130 --> 02:52:32.890]  I was singing a song on my feed the other night, right?
[02:52:32.890 --> 02:52:34.690]  And it was this song I heard by Dion.
[02:52:34.690 --> 02:52:36.170]  I love Dion.
[02:52:36.170 --> 02:52:37.410]  I like 50 shit man.
[02:52:37.410 --> 02:52:38.970]  And the Misfits, go figure.
[02:52:38.970 --> 02:52:40.170]  Anyway, all right.
[02:52:40.170 --> 02:52:44.930]  So this song, The Wanderer by him.
[02:52:44.930 --> 02:52:48.130]  Dude, he could be running for God danged office.
[02:52:48.130 --> 02:52:49.530]  That thing is horrible.
[02:52:49.530 --> 02:52:51.370]  I'm never singing it again.
[02:52:51.370 --> 02:52:52.210]  Read the lyrics to it.
[02:52:52.210 --> 02:52:53.050]  I ain't even gonna say them.
[02:52:53.050 --> 02:52:55.490]  Anyways, I'm gonna find something though.
[02:52:55.490 --> 02:52:56.330]  Hang on.
[02:52:56.330 --> 02:52:58.570]  Oh, oh, you wanna get close Pete?
[02:52:58.570 --> 02:52:59.610]  Oh, I got you, dog.
[02:52:59.610 --> 02:53:00.490]  I got a good one for you.
[02:53:00.490 --> 02:53:01.570]  You know Damien Rice?
[02:53:02.890 --> 02:53:04.090]  I know you do.
[02:53:04.090 --> 02:53:05.690]  I can tell.
[02:53:05.690 --> 02:53:07.730]  Hang on, I'm gonna plug it in and get close.
[02:53:07.730 --> 02:53:08.570]  Hang on.
[02:53:10.650 --> 02:53:12.330]  Oh man.
[02:53:12.330 --> 02:53:13.170]  Yes.
[02:53:19.360 --> 02:53:20.760]  Let's check.
[02:53:20.760 --> 02:53:21.600]  And spin.
[02:53:22.720 --> 02:53:24.120]  Boys.
[02:53:24.920 --> 02:53:25.760]  I'm sorry.
[02:53:25.760 --> 02:53:27.520]  I'm just trying to find a flat spot.
[02:53:27.520 --> 02:53:30.120]  Hey, if you got time to buy a book, get this one.
[02:53:30.120 --> 02:53:32.320]  It's a good book, man.
[02:53:32.320 --> 02:53:34.480]  RCA Vacuum Tube Manual.
[02:53:34.480 --> 02:53:36.200]  Believe it or not, it's really good reading
[02:53:36.200 --> 02:53:38.600]  in the first like 30, 40 pages.
[02:53:38.600 --> 02:53:41.960]  If you wanna understand how guitar amps sound and why.
[02:53:41.960 --> 02:53:43.280]  It's really just a math equation.
[02:53:43.280 --> 02:53:46.240]  On one side is your guitar and the other side is a speaker.
[02:53:46.240 --> 02:53:47.080]  All right.
[02:53:50.240 --> 02:53:51.720]  Matter of fact, actually Pete,
[02:53:52.040 --> 02:53:54.960]  if you go to that, my guitar thing,
[02:53:54.960 --> 02:53:57.240]  there's some blueprints.
[02:53:57.240 --> 02:54:01.240]  I draw really intricate drawings
[02:54:01.240 --> 02:54:02.880]  back when I used to take Hadarol.
[02:54:04.760 --> 02:54:06.360]  Go figure boys.
[02:54:07.920 --> 02:54:10.640]  It's a utilitarian drug, I'll tell you that.
[02:54:10.640 --> 02:54:12.200]  Hey, come on.
[02:54:12.200 --> 02:54:13.560]  All right.
[02:54:13.560 --> 02:54:14.800]  Enough jokes, mister.
[02:54:17.760 --> 02:54:19.200]  I'm gonna do it with my fingers too.
[02:54:19.200 --> 02:54:20.040]  Oh man.
[02:54:21.040 --> 02:54:23.440]  That's the only way you can do Damien Rice songs.
[02:54:24.880 --> 02:54:26.560]  Pete, if you know Damien Rice,
[02:54:26.560 --> 02:54:28.080]  you know what I'm saying, my man.
[02:54:28.080 --> 02:54:28.920]  Come on.
[02:54:30.360 --> 02:54:31.800]  The man is inappropriate.
[02:54:31.800 --> 02:54:33.000]  I'm just gonna put this out here.
[02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:35.600]  All right, first off, Damien Rice, I love him.
[02:54:35.600 --> 02:54:38.160]  Oh man, love him.
[02:54:38.160 --> 02:54:39.400]  But the reason why I love him
[02:54:39.400 --> 02:54:42.320]  is because he's so just God dang overpassionate
[02:54:42.320 --> 02:54:47.320]  that he purposely, I think, just diarrhea the mouse, son.
[02:54:47.880 --> 02:54:50.000]  That's what my grandpa would have called it, I think.
[02:54:51.000 --> 02:54:53.400]  Man, he just says whatever comes out
[02:54:53.400 --> 02:54:55.640]  and he says some filthy stuff in some of his songs
[02:54:55.640 --> 02:54:57.680]  and I like it.
[02:54:57.680 --> 02:55:00.960]  Oh man, that's primal right there now.
[02:55:00.960 --> 02:55:02.320]  Oh gosh.
[02:55:02.320 --> 02:55:03.880]  Anyways, this is one of those songs.
[02:55:03.880 --> 02:55:05.960]  It's inappropriate if you know what he's talking about.
[02:55:05.960 --> 02:55:07.600]  We'll see if you'll figure it out.
[02:55:08.440 --> 02:55:10.120]  I bet you will.
[02:55:10.120 --> 02:55:11.080]  Hey, look here.
[02:55:11.080 --> 02:55:12.520]  I told my wife the other day.
[02:55:14.120 --> 02:55:15.280]  Oh man, I got jokes.
[02:55:16.120 --> 02:55:17.320]  Dad joke time.
[02:55:17.560 --> 02:55:18.960]  No, actually, no, nevermind.
[02:55:18.960 --> 02:55:21.880]  This is on livestream on YouTube, brother.
[02:55:21.880 --> 02:55:23.960]  I can't be telling jokes about my in-laws.
[02:55:26.160 --> 02:55:27.000]  I shouldn't even say that.
[02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:27.840]  Hang on.
[02:55:29.360 --> 02:55:31.160]  All right, let's get serious now.
[02:55:31.160 --> 02:55:32.000]  God dang, Pete.
[02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:37.840]  Oh man.
[02:55:40.160 --> 02:55:42.000]  Leave me out.
[02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:46.280]  This is not what I do.
[02:55:46.280 --> 02:55:49.560]  This is not what I do.
[02:55:49.560 --> 02:55:52.800]  It's the wrong kind of place.
[02:55:54.160 --> 02:55:57.160]  Two beats thinking of you.
[02:55:57.160 --> 02:56:00.960]  It's the wrong time
[02:56:02.040 --> 02:56:04.600]  for somebody new.
[02:56:04.600 --> 02:56:08.200]  It's a small crime.
[02:56:09.680 --> 02:56:10.600]  Is that in tune?
[02:56:10.600 --> 02:56:12.000]  Oh no, I'm just fretting it wrong.
[02:56:12.000 --> 02:56:13.240]  I'm sorry.
[02:56:13.240 --> 02:56:14.840]  God dang idiot.
[02:56:14.840 --> 02:56:15.680]  All right.
[02:56:16.960 --> 02:56:21.320]  It's a small crime,
[02:56:21.320 --> 02:56:24.120]  but I've got no excuse.
[02:56:24.120 --> 02:56:25.520]  Is that all right?
[02:56:25.520 --> 02:56:26.360]  Yeah.
[02:56:29.640 --> 02:56:33.080]  Give my gun away when it's loaded.
[02:56:33.080 --> 02:56:34.520]  Is that all right?
[02:56:34.520 --> 02:56:35.360]  Yeah.
[02:56:36.880 --> 02:56:38.440]  You don't shoot it.
[02:56:38.440 --> 02:56:40.440]  How am I supposed to hold it?
[02:56:40.440 --> 02:56:41.760]  Is that all right?
[02:56:41.760 --> 02:56:42.600]  Yeah.
[02:56:43.600 --> 02:56:47.200]  Give my gun away when it's loaded.
[02:56:47.200 --> 02:56:48.960]  Is that all right?
[02:56:48.960 --> 02:56:51.280]  Is that all right with you?
[02:57:06.200 --> 02:57:07.280]  There it is.
[02:57:07.280 --> 02:57:09.440]  I want it so much better.
[02:57:10.560 --> 02:57:11.400]  See you.
[02:57:12.760 --> 02:57:14.160]  Cheap guitar.
[02:57:14.160 --> 02:57:17.920]  Leave me out with the waste.
[02:57:17.920 --> 02:57:21.440]  This is not what I do.
[02:57:21.440 --> 02:57:25.120]  It's the wrong kind of place
[02:57:26.000 --> 02:57:28.880]  to be cheating on you.
[02:57:28.880 --> 02:57:32.360]  It's the wrong time
[02:57:33.280 --> 02:57:36.000]  and she's fooling me through.
[02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:39.560]  It's a small crime
[02:57:40.560 --> 02:57:43.520]  and I've got no excuse.
[02:57:43.520 --> 02:57:45.080]  Is that all right?
[02:57:45.080 --> 02:57:45.920]  Yeah.
[02:57:49.280 --> 02:57:52.800]  Give my gun away when it's loaded.
[02:57:52.800 --> 02:57:54.440]  Is that all right?
[02:57:54.440 --> 02:57:55.280]  Yeah.
[02:57:56.720 --> 02:57:58.360]  You don't shoot it.
[02:57:58.360 --> 02:58:00.240]  How am I supposed to hold it?
[02:58:00.240 --> 02:58:01.760]  Is that all right?
[02:58:01.760 --> 02:58:02.600]  Yeah.
[02:58:04.480 --> 02:58:06.720]  Is that all right with you?
[02:58:12.110 --> 02:58:13.630]  Is that all right?
[02:58:13.630 --> 02:58:15.470]  Is that all right, Pete?
[02:58:15.470 --> 02:58:16.790]  I mean, it is all right, brother.
[02:58:16.790 --> 02:58:18.190]  I hope everything's all right.
[02:58:18.190 --> 02:58:19.510]  Oh God.
[02:58:19.510 --> 02:58:20.630]  I love songs like that.
[02:58:20.630 --> 02:58:21.910]  They make me feel like it's all right.
[02:58:21.910 --> 02:58:23.670]  You know what I'm saying, homie?
[02:58:23.670 --> 02:58:24.510]  Oh, you want me to sing another one?
[02:58:24.510 --> 02:58:25.350]  You mean unplug?
[02:58:25.350 --> 02:58:26.190]  I'm sorry.
[02:58:26.190 --> 02:58:27.030]  Just tell me.
[02:58:27.030 --> 02:58:27.870]  All right.
[02:58:27.870 --> 02:58:28.710]  Hey, yeah.
[02:58:28.710 --> 02:58:29.550]  Hey, when you want me to stop playing,
[02:58:29.550 --> 02:58:30.870]  just, you know, cut off the feed.
[02:58:30.870 --> 02:58:32.350]  No big deal.
[02:58:32.350 --> 02:58:33.670]  I'll probably still keep playing.
[02:58:33.670 --> 02:58:34.510]  I'm sorry.
[02:58:34.510 --> 02:58:35.350]  I'm sorry.
[02:58:35.350 --> 02:58:36.190]  I'm sorry.
[02:58:36.190 --> 02:58:37.030]  I'm sorry.
[02:58:37.030 --> 02:58:37.870]  I'm sorry.
[02:58:37.870 --> 02:58:38.710]  I'm sorry.
[02:58:38.710 --> 02:58:39.550]  I'm sorry.
[02:58:39.550 --> 02:58:40.390]  I'm sorry.
[02:58:40.390 --> 02:58:41.230]  I'm sorry.
[02:58:41.230 --> 02:58:42.830]  I'll probably still keep playing, man.
[02:58:42.830 --> 02:58:46.150]  Oh, man.
[02:58:49.110 --> 02:58:51.470]  I wanna know.
[02:58:51.470 --> 02:58:54.950]  Have you ever seen the rain?
[02:58:55.830 --> 02:58:57.150]  I wanna know.
[02:58:58.630 --> 02:59:00.910]  Father's got a quick hand.
[02:59:00.910 --> 02:59:03.230]  Man, that's a good song, dude.
[02:59:03.230 --> 02:59:05.270]  Man, I'm trying to think of other cool songs
[02:59:05.270 --> 02:59:08.430]  I know about cool artists so I can highlight them.
[02:59:08.430 --> 02:59:09.270]  Pete?
[02:59:12.820 --> 02:59:14.780]  What's a cool artist that I might know the name of?
[02:59:14.780 --> 02:59:15.620]  Oh, you know what?
[02:59:15.620 --> 02:59:18.180]  Like, oh man, I wish I knew an airplane over the sea
[02:59:18.180 --> 02:59:19.900]  or something from Neutral Milk Hotel.
[02:59:19.900 --> 02:59:21.420]  That's one of my favorite bands
[02:59:21.420 --> 02:59:22.900]  because of the December itself.
[02:59:22.900 --> 02:59:24.380]  Hey, I can play December songs.
[02:59:24.380 --> 02:59:25.420]  You guys like those guys?
[02:59:25.420 --> 02:59:26.420]  Those guys are cool.
[02:59:27.540 --> 02:59:29.420]  Los Angeles, I'm yours.
[02:59:29.420 --> 02:59:30.620]  I wish I knew the lyrics to that one.
[02:59:30.620 --> 02:59:32.980]  Oh, that smell of burnt cocaine, boys.
[02:59:32.980 --> 02:59:34.140]  Hang on.
[02:59:34.140 --> 02:59:35.380]  Hey, Colin Malloy.
[02:59:35.380 --> 02:59:37.140]  Oh God, that guy.
[02:59:37.140 --> 02:59:40.300]  Man, him and Ben, him, Ben, him, I don't know.
[02:59:40.460 --> 02:59:42.300]  Whoever was popular back whenever I was
[02:59:42.300 --> 02:59:44.100]  in an emotional state, I assume.
[02:59:45.500 --> 02:59:49.340]  Back in 2010, I think is when I had my quarter life crisis.
[02:59:49.340 --> 02:59:50.180]  Hang on.
[02:59:59.880 --> 03:00:03.360]  Oh man, Pete, did your wife, did you clean that up, Pete?
[03:00:03.360 --> 03:00:05.440]  Man, I didn't see you get up.
[03:00:05.440 --> 03:00:06.800]  I must've been a high mind.
[03:00:12.700 --> 03:00:14.860]  We can't do what you feed on the air no more.
[03:00:14.940 --> 03:00:16.900]  Oh, the December, that's right.
[03:00:16.900 --> 03:00:18.420]  Okay, let's see if I can remember these lyrics.
[03:00:18.420 --> 03:00:19.940]  Man, I used to sing, okay.
[03:00:19.940 --> 03:00:22.940]  So I used to sing almost nothing but December songs.
[03:00:22.940 --> 03:00:25.780]  That was the man who taught me how to project my voice
[03:00:25.780 --> 03:00:28.500]  a little bit because he was a theater guy.
[03:00:28.500 --> 03:00:32.020]  And so theater singers, they project.
[03:00:32.020 --> 03:00:33.860]  Oh man, I love it.
[03:00:33.860 --> 03:00:36.220]  I love any theater singer that's in a band.
[03:00:36.220 --> 03:00:37.060]  I'm with you.
[03:00:38.260 --> 03:00:39.420]  Yeah, man.
[03:00:39.660 --> 03:00:40.500]  Oh.
[03:00:44.060 --> 03:00:45.580]  All right, let's see if I can do it.

[03:03:34.120 --> 03:03:38.120]  I think we should probably blaze away, honestly,
[03:03:38.120 --> 03:03:42.680]  before my wife blazes away that damn marriage contract
[03:03:42.680 --> 03:03:44.340]  I've just signed.
[03:03:44.340 --> 03:03:47.100]  Ha ha ha.
[03:03:47.100 --> 03:03:49.100]  I can hear you now, Pete.
[03:03:49.100 --> 03:03:51.880]  All right, well, why don't we call it a night?
[03:03:51.880 --> 03:03:54.880]  Because I am also ready to go to bed.
[03:03:54.880 --> 03:03:56.440]  But that was awesome.
[03:03:56.440 --> 03:03:58.360]  I appreciate it.
[03:03:58.360 --> 03:04:00.680]  Man, I want to play all night for you guys.
[03:04:00.680 --> 03:04:01.880]  Every night, dog.
[03:04:01.880 --> 03:04:02.560]  I love it.
[03:04:02.560 --> 03:04:04.280]  I love you.
[03:04:04.280 --> 03:04:05.840]  Well, we can't.
[03:04:05.840 --> 03:04:08.240]  Yeah, we'll do it again very soon.
[03:04:08.240 --> 03:04:09.080]  No, no, no, no, no.
[03:04:09.080 --> 03:04:09.800]  Every night, man.
[03:04:09.800 --> 03:04:10.680]  Whatever night, Pete.
[03:04:10.680 --> 03:04:11.480]  No, no, no, no, no.
[03:04:11.480 --> 03:04:12.840]  I was joking, buddy.
[03:04:12.840 --> 03:04:15.640]  Take it easy.
[03:04:15.640 --> 03:04:16.840]  On occasional nights.
[03:04:16.840 --> 03:04:19.120]  Freudian thoughts you're having there.
[03:04:19.120 --> 03:04:20.440]  Freudian thoughts, indeed.
[03:04:20.440 --> 03:04:22.040]  Hey, all attention is primal.
[03:04:22.040 --> 03:04:23.360]  Just remember that, my friend.
[03:04:26.440 --> 03:04:28.880]  All right, well, I appreciate it.
[03:04:28.880 --> 03:04:33.040]  And I'm ready to go to bed.
[03:04:33.040 --> 03:04:34.360]  Yeah, I don't know.
[03:04:34.360 --> 03:04:37.520]  There's no one behind us I can only think of Hawaii that's
[03:04:37.520 --> 03:04:40.920]  like, well, actually, now, people, I guess.
[03:04:40.920 --> 03:04:41.520]  I don't know.
[03:04:41.520 --> 03:04:43.960]  I was up on Reddit, dude, until like, bro,
[03:04:43.960 --> 03:04:46.600]  I started a 45-minute session at midnight.
[03:04:46.600 --> 03:04:48.760]  And that shit ended at 3 o'clock in the morning.
[03:04:48.760 --> 03:04:50.400]  So you know.
[03:04:50.400 --> 03:04:51.400]  Hey, I love it, man.
[03:04:51.400 --> 03:04:51.900]  I love it.
[03:04:51.900 --> 03:04:54.220]  My phone melted down during the session.
[03:04:54.220 --> 03:04:56.300]  Anyway, we'll tell stories next time.
[03:04:56.300 --> 03:04:57.700]  Hey, I'll see you later.
[03:04:57.700 --> 03:04:58.700]  I really appreciate it.
[03:04:58.700 --> 03:05:01.060]  Man, I thank you so much for everything you do, Peter.
[03:05:01.060 --> 03:05:02.180]  And being you, brother.
[03:05:02.180 --> 03:05:03.700]  Hey, I appreciate you, Peter.
[03:05:03.700 --> 03:05:05.020]  How about that?
[03:05:05.020 --> 03:05:07.420]  And I appreciate you.
[03:05:07.420 --> 03:05:08.380]  All right, buddy.
[03:05:08.380 --> 03:05:09.660]  And I'll talk to you soon.
[03:05:09.660 --> 03:05:12.420]  All right, good night, everyone.
[03:05:12.420 --> 03:05:14.580]  Oh, yeah, bye, everybody else, too.
[03:05:14.580 --> 03:05:17.060]  Yeah, give some love to everybody else.
[03:05:17.060 --> 03:05:19.220]  Hey, man, thank you guys so much.
[03:05:19.220 --> 03:05:21.140]  I'm crazy embarrassed now.
[03:05:21.140 --> 03:05:23.540]  Hey, hope I don't just sing as long as you now.
[03:05:23.540 --> 03:05:26.420]  Don't be showing these songs to nobody.
[03:05:26.420 --> 03:05:28.860]  They said thanks for the music, so.
[03:05:28.860 --> 03:05:30.660]  Thank you guys so much.
[03:05:30.660 --> 03:05:31.580]  Thank you.
[03:05:31.580 --> 03:05:32.940]  It literally means the world.
[03:05:32.940 --> 03:05:36.020]  If it means anything, when I listen to sad songs
[03:05:36.020 --> 03:05:38.860]  that I sang the night before, I listen to them the next day.
[03:05:38.860 --> 03:05:40.100]  And I get to cry, too.
[03:05:40.100 --> 03:05:42.420]  Hey, guys, it's fun.
[03:05:42.420 --> 03:05:45.620]  All right, good night, everyone.
