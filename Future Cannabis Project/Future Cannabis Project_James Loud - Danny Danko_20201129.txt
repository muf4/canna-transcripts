[00:07.000 --> 00:09.000]  Thanks for joining us on a Sunday morning
[00:09.640 --> 00:11.560]  Here's your host
[00:11.560 --> 00:13.560]  Mr. James Loud
[00:13.920 --> 00:16.740]  Hey, how's it going everybody? Welcome to
[00:17.840 --> 00:23.440]  Week, what are we on week 10 Peter of the or not in week 10 this I guess it is week 10 as well
[00:23.440 --> 00:25.440]  But we have Danny Danko here
[00:25.440 --> 00:30.360]  From high times welcome Danny. How you doing? I'm good. Thanks James. Thanks for having me on the show
[00:31.440 --> 00:36.600]  Yeah, it's exciting to be here. Awesome. Yeah, so you got your own show as well, man. It's great
[00:37.120 --> 00:41.880]  You know the the with COVID and everything that's going on. It's kind of great to be able to
[00:42.520 --> 00:44.520]  Evolve and do something different
[00:45.680 --> 00:49.640]  So, yeah, Danny and I have known each other for about 10 maybe 12 years
[00:50.400 --> 00:53.720]  Through high times smoked at the office back in the day
[00:53.720 --> 00:59.640]  You know and then been I've seen you all over the world Spain and Amsterdam and all over the states for the Cups and
[01:00.280 --> 01:03.960]  So yeah, so how are things going with you right now? Oh, things are great
[01:04.840 --> 01:09.720]  Yeah, basically, you know my time at high times came to an end
[01:10.400 --> 01:14.280]  in about April of this year kind of in the middle of the pandemic and
[01:15.240 --> 01:22.360]  Yeah, so basically started up a new podcast. I had been doing one with high times from 2011 to 2018
[01:22.640 --> 01:26.880]  Called free weed that you've been on a few times. I I recall and
[01:28.360 --> 01:35.000]  Yeah, so I started a new one called grow bud yourself which is now on its 31st episode
[01:35.000 --> 01:38.760]  We do that weekly and I helped to launch a new magazine
[01:39.720 --> 01:44.640]  With some partners the magazine is called Northeast leaf magazine, but my partners
[01:45.320 --> 01:50.040]  In it actually are a bunch of people from high times former high times staffers
[01:50.040 --> 01:52.520]  That I sort of recruited into this new magazine
[01:53.040 --> 01:54.320]  along with
[01:54.320 --> 01:59.120]  The crew from Northwest leaf up in in the Washington area Seattle
[01:59.440 --> 02:02.000]  Who have been doing this for 10 years and they have?
[02:02.640 --> 02:04.320]  Northwest leaf
[02:04.320 --> 02:06.320]  California leaf
[02:06.320 --> 02:12.320]  Oregon leaf, Alaska leaf Maryland leaf and now we launched Northeast leaf. So it's exciting. We're in eight different states
[02:12.960 --> 02:17.480]  In the Northeast, it's a free magazine, which is a new model for me. Very exciting
[02:17.600 --> 02:21.640]  And you know, it's just it's exciting to be back in in you know
[02:21.640 --> 02:26.320]  The print media cannabis world and and doing podcasts and you know
[02:26.320 --> 02:29.960]  I think there's a lot of interest right now because of kovat and restrictions in
[02:31.080 --> 02:34.000]  home cultivation and as you and I both know
[02:34.560 --> 02:38.560]  Home cultivation is the way to get the best quality cannabis. And and so
[02:39.120 --> 02:43.640]  You know, my grow book has been selling pretty well in the last, you know, eight months or so
[02:43.640 --> 02:47.680]  The podcast and the magazine all doing well, so it's exciting and
[02:48.440 --> 02:54.040]  You know just just really happy and excited for the future, you know, especially once all this
[02:54.600 --> 02:57.080]  You know pandemic stuff. Hopefully is over
[02:58.880 --> 03:01.480]  Yeah, man, I just you know, I think
[03:02.480 --> 03:08.080]  It's it's only maybe six months to a year away before we're back to 100% to normal
[03:08.080 --> 03:11.880]  I know they kind of talked about it, but I think it's it's it's it's
[03:11.880 --> 03:16.760]  100% to normal. I know the economy is gonna be kind of trashed but other than that, I mean, I'm
[03:17.320 --> 03:20.040]  Happy that we're in the place that we're at. I guess they have vaccines
[03:20.040 --> 03:23.160]  So we'll be able to travel sometime in the near future maybe by spring
[03:25.560 --> 03:30.560]  But yeah, so as far as your book you want to tell us a little bit more about your book, you know
[03:30.560 --> 03:37.360]  You I guess you just released it in the last what a year less than a year ago. Actually, it was September of 2018
[03:37.360 --> 03:39.360]  Oh, wow. Yeah, I have a
[03:40.000 --> 03:43.600]  To have a copy right here and it's a beginner's guide to growing
[03:44.640 --> 03:47.480]  Cannabis, it's called cannabis a beginner's guide to growing marijuana. And
[03:48.080 --> 03:54.040]  Yeah, it's really, you know basic for beginners and I think it's important at the time
[03:54.840 --> 03:59.080]  Now because so many people, you know, people are interested in homesteading, you know
[03:59.800 --> 04:04.640]  Growing their own food and cannabis just fits perfectly into that. You know, it's just part of
[04:05.240 --> 04:07.840]  Gardening and you know, you can do it in a small space and
[04:08.320 --> 04:13.080]  like I mentioned the quality is gonna be better than anything you can find in a store or on the street and
[04:14.560 --> 04:16.080]  It's fun
[04:16.080 --> 04:20.920]  All right. It's a lot of fun important. Yeah, that's where you get the quality. I feel is like from the home grow
[04:21.600 --> 04:22.680]  There's just you know
[04:22.680 --> 04:28.760]  there's so many things that you can learn from growing plants too and and also like you've been able to travel around and see grows
[04:28.760 --> 04:35.920]  All around and kind of pick people's brains and pick apart ideas and see what works and what doesn't work in certain environments
[04:37.320 --> 04:41.320]  What's the biggest tip that you would have for a new beginner? Oh
[04:42.560 --> 04:44.080]  Wow
[04:44.080 --> 04:46.600]  Well, I think overdoing it is almost always
[04:47.280 --> 04:51.600]  The the first mistakes people make over over feeding over watering
[04:52.760 --> 04:54.840]  so, you know my first tip would be
[04:55.360 --> 05:00.440]  You know sometimes just stay out of the way and let the plant grow because you know
[05:00.440 --> 05:04.000]  You're really just trying to create the environment in which the plant will be happy
[05:04.000 --> 05:08.960]  and if you do that, the plant will be happy and you know feeding it more food or
[05:09.880 --> 05:13.880]  You know drowning it in in more liquid or anything is not gonna help
[05:13.880 --> 05:20.720]  so sometimes you just need to stay stay out of it and you know, as always don't believe everything you read on the internet and
[05:21.720 --> 05:25.400]  You know and you know do it for the love of the plant and for you know
[05:26.400 --> 05:28.400]  The idea that you know, you're really all about
[05:29.480 --> 05:33.520]  Like I said creating the perfect environment for the plant to grow and thrive
[05:34.920 --> 05:40.000]  Awesome. So with New York and the laws you haven't done much home grow I bet
[05:40.720 --> 05:43.920]  yeah, I mean it's been tough the last few years really just because
[05:44.560 --> 05:51.320]  You know having written the book and been you know a name over at High Times for so long it was
[05:52.040 --> 05:58.840]  It just would have been kind of detrimental in my home with my family and everything. So I haven't really gotten to do
[05:59.800 --> 06:04.920]  Home growing in the recent past, you know always got my you know
[06:05.520 --> 06:09.800]  Fingers out there. Like you mentioned I visit a lot of gardens and you know, I love
[06:10.320 --> 06:17.680]  Being able to contribute, you know when when people are interested in having help and things like that, but
[06:18.840 --> 06:22.520]  Yeah, we really were you know struggling here in New York to change the laws
[06:22.520 --> 06:28.840]  But I think now that New Jersey changed New York and Connecticut are gonna change soon and you know, I'm always for home grow
[06:28.840 --> 06:33.760]  I like when there's at least you know, a few plants that people can grow like there is in Massachusetts
[06:34.360 --> 06:37.240]  You've got six plants per person twelve per household
[06:37.760 --> 06:41.480]  And the limit, you know, it's on the number of plants but you can grow big plants and you know
[06:41.480 --> 06:45.200]  Vegem out a little longer and have nice a nice yield. So
[06:46.640 --> 06:51.300]  Yeah, I'm I you know, I strongly believe in home girl. I think for patients it's important too
[06:51.300 --> 06:53.960]  It's like, you know, we mentioned that it's fun and that it's high quality
[06:54.000 --> 06:58.960]  But I don't think there's anything better than actually creating your own medicine, you know
[06:58.960 --> 07:05.560]  It's therapeutic just to create it and then on top of that it's helping to heal you with with plant medicine
[07:05.560 --> 07:07.960]  Which is essential and I think very important
[07:09.120 --> 07:11.880]  Totally and then knowing what's in it. I mean knowing what you put in it
[07:11.880 --> 07:15.480]  I think that's just so huge is like especially if you have some sort of condition
[07:16.160 --> 07:19.800]  You know as far as medical is concerned. I want to know you know, just for myself
[07:19.800 --> 07:25.560]  I mean I have ulcerative colitis and some other issues as far as medical is concerned
[07:25.560 --> 07:32.520]  But I really want to know what's in the stuff that I'm smoking or that I'm consuming whether it's a tincture or an edible or
[07:32.840 --> 07:35.640]  I'm smoking or whether whether it's rosin
[07:35.640 --> 07:40.520]  it's like really important to know for me that there's no pesticides, especially because I feel like
[07:41.080 --> 07:45.360]  Back 20 years ago. We really didn't think about it. We were using all kinds of crap and
[07:46.040 --> 07:49.580]  You know, I had an aunt that was very she was a very big
[07:50.400 --> 07:56.680]  Proponent of organics long before we were discussing organics with cannabis. She was she was talking to me about organics and health
[07:57.000 --> 08:04.000]  But yeah, so let's take this back a step further before high times and how you kind of got into the cannabis industry
[08:04.000 --> 08:06.000]  You're a pro skater, right?
[08:06.000 --> 08:08.000]  I'm not pro just
[08:08.320 --> 08:11.280]  Just did some skating. I had some friends that went pro
[08:12.120 --> 08:14.120]  And that you know, I just tried to keep up with
[08:14.680 --> 08:16.680]  but yeah, I was a
[08:16.760 --> 08:18.360]  You know a grower
[08:18.360 --> 08:23.680]  Back in the 90s and I was in that world that you're talking about the skateboarding sort of graffiti
[08:23.800 --> 08:25.800]  You know world here on the East Coast and
[08:27.360 --> 08:31.440]  You just kind of got known for having good cannabis I was growing and and you know
[08:31.440 --> 08:36.160]  It was it was better than what you could get or what most people could get out on the marketplace. So
[08:37.000 --> 08:39.000]  Kind of just made a name for myself like that
[08:39.000 --> 08:43.800]  And then I started working for a hemp clothing company actually before high times that was called a head case
[08:43.800 --> 08:49.920]  We made baseball hats and we were two of the only companies here on the East Coast high times and head case
[08:49.920 --> 08:53.360]  You know had a lot of friends over there and eventually a job opened up
[08:54.320 --> 08:56.600]  You know and it was really just to get my foot in the door
[08:56.600 --> 09:02.400]  it was answering the phone and breaking down boxes and you know dealing with subscriptions and products and things and
[09:03.240 --> 09:08.240]  You know, it was the only job I ever really wanted, you know, it's just really just like a dream come true to
[09:09.280 --> 09:14.000]  You know work for a magazine that had taught me so much about growing and
[09:14.000 --> 09:16.000]  You know just the lifestyle the
[09:16.640 --> 09:23.200]  kind of outlaw culture, you know and just you know understanding that you didn't have to believe everything the government tells you and
[09:24.240 --> 09:26.240]  certainly not when it comes to things like
[09:27.120 --> 09:30.320]  Plant-based medicines, which we all know are you know a healing?
[09:31.280 --> 09:34.320]  flower rather than some dangerous narcotic and so
[09:35.360 --> 09:37.360]  You know, how do you deal with that?
[09:37.560 --> 09:39.560]  You know
[09:44.680 --> 09:45.920]  Since 70
[09:45.920 --> 09:49.220]  1974, you know high times was like the one national
[09:49.720 --> 09:52.400]  Magazine that you could get that information from and so to work
[09:52.400 --> 09:56.540]  There was just an honor and a privilege and a pleasure and and it took me all around the world
[09:56.540 --> 10:00.720]  I mean I got to go as you mentioned Amsterdam every November right around this time of year
[10:00.720 --> 10:03.940]  We'd be we'd be in in Amsterdam judging
[10:04.740 --> 10:11.020]  You know all the seed company strains of a coffee shop strains and hash from all around the world and crazy hash
[10:11.020 --> 10:16.220]  yeah, right like all that import hash, you know the the you know charis and the
[10:17.180 --> 10:22.700]  Moroccan the part of the highest grades of Moroccan that would be saved for that, you know month or that week and
[10:23.420 --> 10:25.740]  of course, you know Afghan and
[10:27.100 --> 10:29.420]  Nepalese, you know the just the real
[10:30.420 --> 10:33.500]  Traditional Lebanese also just all those traditional hashes
[10:33.980 --> 10:40.180]  From around the world and getting to sample those and and and then you know the seed company stuff, too
[10:40.180 --> 10:44.420]  I mean that started to change the world and we watched all the changes in solvent less, you know
[10:44.420 --> 10:49.540]  Go from basically like black chunks of ice water hash that you know
[10:50.420 --> 10:57.420]  Was questionable as far as moisture content to the stuff that we're seeing now, which is you know next level dabble
[10:57.860 --> 11:01.380]  You know amazing Rosins and it's crazy
[11:04.500 --> 11:09.020]  Yeah, and getting to go to Spain and you know Vancouver Vancouver Island and
[11:09.540 --> 11:16.420]  You know really just it the the job took me all over the world for you know, 18 years and so
[11:18.340 --> 11:19.740]  You know, like I said
[11:19.740 --> 11:24.220]  It was an honor and a pleasure to be a part of all that and so many changes that happened during that time
[11:24.620 --> 11:27.500]  Legally and with you know, like as we mentioned concentrates
[11:28.260 --> 11:35.980]  Edibles, I mean God we all we had was brownies and space cakes back then and now you can you can consume cannabis
[11:35.980 --> 11:38.380]  and in almost anything drinks and
[11:38.980 --> 11:41.540]  eyedrops and soda and you know chocolates and
[11:42.100 --> 11:45.900]  Tinctures tinctures, right? I think I got some syringes
[11:47.100 --> 11:49.100]  Yeah, I mean
[11:50.060 --> 11:54.740]  Right, right. Yeah, we got these joke about we used to joke about you know, cannabis suppositories now
[11:54.740 --> 11:56.900]  They're real and they're helping people with
[11:57.500 --> 11:59.420]  You know cancers
[11:59.420 --> 12:06.740]  So yeah, it's it it is amazing to see how far things have come and the most yeah. Yeah, that's amazing
[12:08.220 --> 12:10.500]  Totally Lou they got lube they have
[12:13.300 --> 12:16.760]  Some people can't even take a break from getting high to
[12:19.100 --> 12:20.740]  I guess
[12:20.740 --> 12:24.820]  Just great. But yeah, I mean someone said sounds like the coolest job ever
[12:24.820 --> 12:29.420]  I gotta say, you know, I heard that a lot as you know, it was happening and
[12:30.140 --> 12:34.380]  Never took it for granted. It really you know my passport
[12:35.580 --> 12:37.580]  You know is 99%
[12:38.420 --> 12:42.140]  you know based in cannabis trips all around the world and
[12:43.740 --> 12:48.420]  So getting to see those places, you know in Spain and and everywhere else just
[12:49.100 --> 12:52.180]  such an eye-opener and really life-changing for me and
[12:53.460 --> 12:58.660]  All because of the plant, you know just because of a devotion dedication to the plant is really what it's about
[12:58.660 --> 13:05.380]  It's not about names or people or you know, I worked hard I you know met my deadlines. I wrote articles
[13:05.380 --> 13:09.500]  I thought people would be interested and want to see took pictures of the stuff that
[13:10.300 --> 13:13.580]  You know was was in front of my face, but you know it
[13:14.340 --> 13:16.460]  It really was just I love this plant
[13:16.460 --> 13:19.580]  I love meeting the people in all the different countries
[13:20.540 --> 13:27.540]  That are also dedicated to it. I'm you know, angry about the laws against it and people in prison because of that and
[13:28.340 --> 13:32.620]  So, you know last 20 25 years has been quite a quite a ride
[13:33.100 --> 13:35.900]  For sure for you for me and and all of us
[13:36.700 --> 13:40.180]  You know and everyone that came before us to that's passed along the way
[13:41.180 --> 13:47.060]  Totally, you know, it's funny it was such a small subculture and then going to places like Amsterdam
[13:47.060 --> 13:50.420]  It was like going to see your family once a year, you know
[13:50.420 --> 13:53.460]  It's like people that you know really well that you'd hang out with for at least a week
[13:53.460 --> 13:57.100]  I mean, I would go for two to three weeks every year. Yeah for me, you know
[13:57.100 --> 14:00.940]  I at first I called it marijuana fantasy camp, you know, because you know
[14:01.500 --> 14:06.700]  Meeting, you know Soma and and you know, Ari on and all the people over there
[14:07.700 --> 14:15.260]  Whose seeds I had grown and whose advice I had taken, you know and who were kind of like our heroes
[14:15.260 --> 14:17.880]  You know for sports guys, it's the sports people for us
[14:17.880 --> 14:21.900]  it was the the breeders and the pioneers and and getting to go over there and
[14:22.420 --> 14:27.340]  you know rub elbows with them and hang out and have meals and share cannabis and hash and
[14:27.780 --> 14:33.780]  Knowledge and genetics it was life-changing. And yeah, so I call it, you know marijuana fantasy camp
[14:34.780 --> 14:41.740]  Totally some guys were into collecting, you know playboys and hustlers and we were out here collecting high times magazines and you know, it's
[14:42.260 --> 14:48.060]  Amazing. Yeah and getting to go and meet the person who bred the strain that you know, you're growing back home
[14:48.940 --> 14:54.580]  Was a dream, you know and to talk to them about it and see what's next on the horizon and what the new
[14:54.860 --> 15:00.540]  Cup winners are what the new seed banks on the scene are and new new flavors new strains
[15:00.900 --> 15:06.260]  It's just you know, if you're into something then that's the you know, the comic-con or the
[15:07.020 --> 15:10.220]  You know, that's that's the week that where it all comes together
[15:10.220 --> 15:16.700]  And then what's interesting is, you know at that time it was only Amsterdam that was like that and and little by little
[15:17.540 --> 15:22.420]  It started to become that way in other places, you know and even here back home
[15:22.420 --> 15:27.780]  And that's really the ultimate dream was when you know to see those changes happen and to have
[15:28.780 --> 15:31.820]  Places we can order cannabis off a menu and
[15:32.740 --> 15:36.100]  You know be treated like a customer instead of a criminal
[15:36.900 --> 15:38.900]  right
[15:39.140 --> 15:43.620]  Yeah, it's funny so I was on so my favorite magazine growing up was the
[15:44.340 --> 15:49.020]  Million-dollar grow room. I thought it was so impressive. There was some ecstasy and stuff in that article and
[15:49.620 --> 15:54.640]  But but beyond the ecstasy it was the million-dollar grow room and I was so fascinated and that was always my favorite
[15:55.440 --> 16:00.320]  Article and favorite magazine growing up and then my room got to be on the cover and I was featured in the
[16:00.920 --> 16:02.920]  Issue I think 10 years after that
[16:03.240 --> 16:08.480]  There were 10 or 15 years after that something like that, but I was on the the million-dollar grow room
[16:09.520 --> 16:14.720]  so I would you know, it was it's still kind of surreal thinking that high times put it put a
[16:15.680 --> 16:21.180]  Picture of my grow and then also had me on there Malcolm had Dan sky as he goes by
[16:21.500 --> 16:23.500]  It come out and we did a tour of
[16:23.500 --> 16:28.540]  The lot of that he stayed at my house and we did a tour of the loud seed stuff that we were doing some of
[16:28.540 --> 16:30.540]  The breeding stuff we went to loud mountain
[16:30.860 --> 16:36.260]  which is what we called it back in the day where we did breeding and outdoor growing with one of my partners and then we
[16:36.260 --> 16:38.020]  went down to Fresno and
[16:38.020 --> 16:41.400]  Check stuff out. But yeah, those those times seem surreal
[16:42.020 --> 16:47.460]  High times cups back in the day in the United States. The early ones were just so amazing
[16:48.140 --> 16:55.820]  Yeah, I mean that was the vibe we tried to take what was what had happened in Amsterdam and bring it over to the US
[16:55.820 --> 16:58.280]  Without really knowing whether whether we could pull it off or not
[16:58.280 --> 17:01.920]  So, you know the first few times it was pretty wild and you know
[17:01.920 --> 17:07.260]  I should mention loud Scout was one of those strains that came, you know out of nowhere and and you know
[17:07.260 --> 17:09.740]  Shocked the world and and became one of those
[17:10.460 --> 17:14.780]  You know staples that you know a cup winner that everybody had to smoke
[17:15.500 --> 17:21.220]  So it's pretty exciting. But yeah the the US Cups we started in the San Francisco area and then
[17:22.140 --> 17:26.820]  You know, Colorado had some big legal changes obviously, so we started doing Denver and
[17:28.020 --> 17:31.380]  SoCal and you know pretty much all over at one point
[17:31.980 --> 17:33.180]  and
[17:33.180 --> 17:37.260]  You know a lot a lot of fun times and a lot of great
[17:37.900 --> 17:40.880]  Memories and great things that happened for cannabis, you know
[17:41.440 --> 17:44.080]  a lot of businesses and friendships and
[17:44.600 --> 17:46.600]  marriages and all kinds of things that
[17:46.960 --> 17:51.560]  that came out of all of that and other competitions that have taken it to different levels and
[17:52.080 --> 17:56.560]  You know and regional sort of events that are pretty exciting as well
[17:57.040 --> 18:02.960]  Yeah, Seattle Seattle was great. Seattle was great. I got the Seattle hat and the Seattle shirt on nice
[18:03.640 --> 18:08.160]  Good. Yeah, yeah, you know and that was just us basically trying to replicate
[18:08.160 --> 18:12.680]  You know what had happened over in Holland because we wanted to do it back home
[18:12.680 --> 18:16.760]  And and you could see how much things would change every year
[18:17.280 --> 18:23.120]  And you know certain categories would change every couple of months like for instance the solventless hash
[18:23.440 --> 18:26.680]  You know, you just see something brand new come in and then you know
[18:26.680 --> 18:30.800]  suddenly now it's all about rosin or it's about fresh frozen or it's this or that and
[18:31.680 --> 18:35.040]  Every one of those trends was first spotted at a cup, you know
[18:35.040 --> 18:37.920]  Yeah, we were like loud seeds with our friends
[18:37.920 --> 18:42.080]  We were so far ahead of the curve the judges didn't even know how to judge the sauce that we had back in the day
[18:42.080 --> 18:45.280]  Now everybody smokes sauce. It was like I think Denver
[18:45.800 --> 18:47.320]  2013 with
[18:47.320 --> 18:49.640]  With Nectar's which was holy water at the time
[18:49.640 --> 18:54.960]  They we shared a booth with them and we entered stuff and it was by far the turpey as people were going crazy for it
[18:54.960 --> 18:58.880]  But the judges were like, how do we compare it to shower? It's right, right
[18:58.880 --> 19:03.080]  It was too too innovative and new for it to even you know
[19:03.640 --> 19:08.800]  Register in some ways there wasn't you know a consensus on how to consume certain things like that
[19:08.800 --> 19:15.280]  and so all those things changed as well, you know things went from you know, the way that people dab has changed and
[19:16.240 --> 19:21.720]  You know, lots of people had their first dabs at these events, which is pretty amazing their last
[19:21.720 --> 19:23.720]  Yeah
[19:25.720 --> 19:27.720]  Big time, yeah, yeah
[19:27.800 --> 19:28.320]  Yeah
[19:28.320 --> 19:33.680]  I mean I've seen people go, you know fishing out on the ground shaking crazy after doing a dab and
[19:33.680 --> 19:38.800]  Some of them get right back up and high-five you and other ones are like scared to death, you know, but oh, yeah
[19:38.880 --> 19:39.400]  Yeah
[19:39.400 --> 19:43.640]  Well, there's a whole sub subdivision of people who want to like lay people out
[19:43.640 --> 19:50.160]  I'm of the opinion that hey, you know start people slow, you know get them into it with like a nice small dab
[19:50.160 --> 19:52.160]  but then there you know you have your
[19:52.760 --> 19:54.520]  your devilish
[19:54.520 --> 19:59.160]  friends who just you know want to lay someone out with their first dab and
[20:00.560 --> 20:03.480]  Doesn't always work out great. But you know for the most part people
[20:04.480 --> 20:08.040]  people realize like hey, this is this is next level and
[20:10.480 --> 20:16.840]  Yeah, it's just exciting to see all the changes the first cup in San Francisco we did dabs off of a charcoal
[20:17.640 --> 20:21.960]  Yeah with the straw with the throat the glass straw, yeah, oh, yeah totally yeah
[20:21.960 --> 20:25.480]  my first dab in Spain was was you know, the the the
[20:26.720 --> 20:32.840]  Little swing the copper swing that would swing under the bong that you would heat till it was glowing bright red
[20:34.960 --> 20:40.560]  Yeah, well that's with the hot knife hits so the right in the 90s we used to do hot knife hits, you know
[20:40.560 --> 20:43.520]  My parents I ruin their knives you take the knives out of the drawer
[20:43.520 --> 20:49.560]  You take two knives heat them up on the burner till they're red hot and then you take the hash with the cardboard tube
[20:49.560 --> 20:51.560]  And you'd hit it. Yeah, you know
[20:52.320 --> 20:57.040]  Then it would burn your throat. It would get you jacked up, but it would get you really lit. Oh, yeah
[20:57.080 --> 21:00.200]  No, yeah, I mean we I remember hash oil from the 80s
[21:00.200 --> 21:06.400]  I mean this was like the bikers had this these vials of oil and we would dip cigarettes and then smoke these
[21:07.200 --> 21:12.120]  45 minute long gross oil like greasy green cigarettes
[21:12.920 --> 21:19.000]  And get lit, you know, but like how gross is that thinking back now, you know and
[21:19.520 --> 21:21.240]  That's why it's funny now when you know
[21:21.240 --> 21:25.840]  You walk into a shop and there's all the lab tests and everything down to like point
[21:25.840 --> 21:30.340]  You know down to the hundreds of a point of how many turps and which you know
[21:30.340 --> 21:32.720]  How much little bits of mercy and or whatever?
[21:33.200 --> 21:38.000]  It's nice to know all those things, but we you know, we didn't have that advantage back in those days
[21:38.240 --> 21:41.840]  Yeah, it was either it fucked you up or you know, it didn't fuck you up
[21:43.200 --> 21:47.920]  We had ground brown blood and green, but you know, I think there was strange, you know as long as I can remember
[21:49.120 --> 21:55.960]  They've had specific genetics, you know, like we had in California. I'm growing I grew up in the Bay Area. So we did have cultivars
[21:57.240 --> 22:01.520]  Unique stuff but some of it was like Mendo, but we had you know Mendo
[22:01.520 --> 22:05.680]  But the stuff coming out from Mendo was very similar at the time. It was all from the same growers
[22:06.240 --> 22:11.800]  We had the Mendo perps I remember back in the day that was dark purple for $4,000 a pound. Mm-hmm
[22:12.280 --> 22:15.680]  So what what was your first strain that you smoked that you remember?
[22:17.680 --> 22:18.920]  Wow, that's a good question
[22:18.920 --> 22:23.160]  I mean we we used to go up when I grew up in Boston and we used to go up to Vermont and pick up
[22:23.160 --> 22:26.160]  bud similar to what you're talking about, but kind of our version of
[22:27.000 --> 22:29.200]  Kind but at the time this purple Afghani
[22:30.160 --> 22:31.520]  and
[22:31.520 --> 22:34.760]  That was really really nice. You know, it was a little leafy it was
[22:35.600 --> 22:41.800]  You know certainly probably wouldn't compare much to what we smoke nowadays, but it was way better than you know
[22:41.800 --> 22:43.800]  the Mexican or the zona
[22:44.080 --> 22:48.680]  or even like some of the Canadian that that was starting to come around at that time, but
[22:49.600 --> 22:54.740]  It was really I think my first real nice bong hit of like kind bud
[22:55.720 --> 22:57.920]  There was this this hippie girl
[22:57.960 --> 22:59.960]  That
[23:00.000 --> 23:05.620]  Gave me a bong hit and actually I felt nauseous and made me nauseous. It was that strong
[23:06.160 --> 23:13.180]  And it was just a one hitter bong. I was just so used to you know, brick weed and Mexican, you know
[23:14.320 --> 23:18.120]  Yeah, just you know are pulling seeds out of it and you know
[23:18.960 --> 23:22.040]  And this was something else. This was something that was homegrown
[23:22.040 --> 23:26.000]  And so that would have been probably right around I guess around
[23:26.640 --> 23:29.880]  89 you know 89 or 90 so
[23:30.520 --> 23:35.080]  You know, it was probably a couple of years after that before I even encountered something that good again
[23:35.080 --> 23:35.600]  You know
[23:35.600 --> 23:43.500]  It was partly what inspired me in those days really to grow more too was because I liked the highest quality canvas
[23:43.880 --> 23:45.880]  So much more than anything I could buy
[23:46.320 --> 23:50.720]  And you know your options were so limited. It's like you had kind of had to grow it
[23:50.920 --> 23:55.720]  You know and then once you do it you had extra around so you sold it and suddenly, you know
[23:55.720 --> 23:57.720]  It was just it was part of a lifestyle
[23:58.600 --> 24:04.200]  Yeah, someone was asking about the honey oil from the 90s. I remember a book called cannabis alchemy
[24:04.200 --> 24:07.240]  it was like this little thin paperback book that had a
[24:07.760 --> 24:13.840]  Reflux apparatus and all these old-school techniques to make the honey oil and yeah, that was pre pre sauce
[24:15.000 --> 24:22.300]  Not not terpy at all, but would get you fucked up. Yeah. Yeah, very crude kind of just, you know simple extraction
[24:22.660 --> 24:29.820]  Yeah, what would be considered now something that people would probably make you know edibles or you know some kind of low quality
[24:30.620 --> 24:31.980]  Yeah
[24:31.980 --> 24:38.780]  Products out of that, you know, whereas to us that was like the the you know highest of refinements
[24:40.140 --> 24:42.460]  We'd be like dropping it in the joints like
[24:43.020 --> 24:47.180]  Right. Yeah good stuff or rubbing it on the papers. We used to do a lot of that
[24:47.940 --> 24:49.940]  even the crude I think we used
[24:50.540 --> 24:57.900]  Dude we would use a like shitty rubbing alcohol to do stuff back in the day not thinking how bad it was
[24:57.900 --> 25:03.340]  We'd get rid of the alcohol but like it's definitely not a good way to go. Yeah ethanol son. It's so much more pure
[25:03.660 --> 25:09.580]  Yeah, I mean and that's another thing about legalization and stuff is people, you know, obviously, you know, there's overregulation
[25:10.100 --> 25:14.980]  There's taxes. There's all the bullshit of the bull that we deal with but you know
[25:15.660 --> 25:19.140]  Knowing what's in your your product is so important
[25:19.140 --> 25:25.500]  And I mean think of Mexico and the Paraquat situation where they were like spraying these plants with you know
[25:26.060 --> 25:27.380]  Something that's meant to kill them
[25:27.380 --> 25:32.420]  But of course, you know if you harvest it fast enough and bag it up quick enough and ship it
[25:32.420 --> 25:35.780]  You know, it's not gonna die. It's just gonna get smoked and
[25:36.380 --> 25:44.500]  The fact that people were smoking, you know poisons, you know, and that's the government the government was poisoning the plants trying to kill them
[25:44.500 --> 25:48.220]  but like, you know inevitably some of that stuff made it onto the market and
[25:48.780 --> 25:52.340]  You know and that's the same as bathtub gin, you know where people are making booze
[25:52.780 --> 25:57.540]  During prohibition and it's making people go blind and stuff, you know doesn't happen anymore
[25:57.540 --> 26:03.300]  why because it's all tested and regulated and most people aren't, you know purchasing moonshine, but
[26:03.700 --> 26:10.100]  You know the fact that something was illegal made it so that we were at the mercy of whoever wanted to pour anything
[26:10.100 --> 26:16.020]  They wanted to pour on it. And as you mentioned pesticides are bad, but but overfed plants are bad, too
[26:16.300 --> 26:18.460]  You know just because you know
[26:19.220 --> 26:21.220]  phosphorus or nitrogen are
[26:21.560 --> 26:25.240]  You know benign sort of elements doesn't mean you want to smoke high
[26:25.700 --> 26:29.460]  Concentrations of them along with your you know, cannabis flowers. It's it's
[26:30.140 --> 26:33.260]  And besides it tastes like shit, right? It doesn't burn
[26:34.260 --> 26:39.820]  You know doesn't have the proper effect even you know because it's not an enjoyable experience and
[26:40.260 --> 26:46.140]  You and I both know how overfed most cannabis is too. It's like oh, yeah, people don't flush
[26:46.140 --> 26:51.340]  There's all kinds of issues for sure. Mm-hmm. And that's another reason that thing
[26:51.340 --> 26:56.060]  I used to tell people about winning the cups and stuff. It's not just about having the genetics
[26:56.060 --> 26:59.660]  it's about growing the strain properly and not over feeding and
[27:00.180 --> 27:06.180]  You know drying and curing properly so that you know because you're up against the same strains and lots of cases
[27:06.180 --> 27:10.180]  I mean in Southern Cali if you're in the indica category, there's gonna be a lot of cush
[27:15.060 --> 27:22.980]  I've judged those contests where it's literally, you know, 35 out of 42 just straight OG hybrids of some kind or another
[27:23.620 --> 27:25.620]  And at that point you're really
[27:25.900 --> 27:29.540]  Judging the grower and not the strain and so much of that has to do with
[27:31.460 --> 27:34.620]  Proper feeding and proper drying and curing
[27:35.340 --> 27:42.100]  Yeah, it's timing too. It's funny because you can be the best grower in the world and enter a cup and you know Alfred
[27:42.620 --> 27:46.540]  Master Yoda, we were both friends with he told me, you know
[27:46.540 --> 27:50.060]  He was there the from the first cup that I won man. I got off stage
[27:50.060 --> 27:52.180]  he gave me a big hug and congratulated me and
[27:52.860 --> 27:59.700]  You know, we got to talking I think the next day or the day after in 2012 in Amsterdam and he was saying
[27:59.700 --> 28:01.700]  you know any given Sunday and
[28:02.420 --> 28:05.500]  You know, I think there's so much involved with timing
[28:05.740 --> 28:09.580]  I'm not gonna say luck because I think there's so much more to it than luck but
[28:10.140 --> 28:16.740]  Timing for your crop and each because there's so many many pieces and components to growing a perfect cycle
[28:16.740 --> 28:18.740]  You know as far as drying and curing
[28:18.860 --> 28:22.700]  You know room temps all those things throughout that life cycle of that plant
[28:23.820 --> 28:28.140]  You know and it comes out slightly different on a booty, you know, especially homegrown level
[28:28.140 --> 28:31.620]  it comes out different slightly different every time and so
[28:32.380 --> 28:35.380]  Just because you have the best genetics doesn't mean it's gonna come out
[28:35.500 --> 28:41.420]  Perfect and win that cup and I think high times really in the beginning of those cups were super competitive
[28:41.820 --> 28:47.060]  In in the States, you know, we had some amazing stuff and it got more competitive more competitive
[28:47.060 --> 28:52.100]  But there's a lot more commercial and then you know more people started entering cups, too
[28:52.100 --> 28:56.420]  You know as far as I think people were scared to enter cups in the States in the beginning, too
[28:58.540 --> 29:02.340]  Yeah, I mean I met a lot of people who were like I just entered you know
[29:02.460 --> 29:07.260]  Just to get my name on the list and you know, basically promote myself and boom
[29:07.260 --> 29:14.340]  I took second place or third place or or one, you know that that happens pretty frequently to where people just assume
[29:14.340 --> 29:17.700]  Oh, you know, they've always heard stories. It's fixed or you got to spend all this money
[29:17.700 --> 29:22.620]  And so they're just like I'll I'll enter and see what happens and then boom like if you show up with the fire
[29:22.980 --> 29:27.460]  Any anybody can win and I've seen that over and over. I mean we won
[29:29.060 --> 29:33.500]  We showed up with the smallest booth we had swerve right across from us who'd spent like
[29:33.820 --> 29:37.980]  250 grand on his booth and everything else with this little 10 by 10 and
[29:38.620 --> 29:43.420]  Thinking you know, I'd entered the stuff that I thought was the best and was like there's no way I'm gonna win
[29:43.980 --> 29:48.100]  You know thinking that and then we ended up winning and it's like well, yeah
[29:48.100 --> 29:51.900]  You know anybody can win if you bring the if you bring the fire, you know
[29:51.900 --> 29:57.940]  I'm not gonna say that that I haven't felt like there was some issues with high times judging but uh,
[29:58.340 --> 30:01.740]  You know, there's definitely proof is in the pudding. I mean the year 2012
[30:01.740 --> 30:04.140]  We weren't spending any money with high times really back then
[30:04.820 --> 30:10.940]  Yeah, I mean every time I judged everything was on the up-and-up that I that I saw I mean there was hundreds of cups
[30:11.420 --> 30:16.300]  Or over a hundred at some, you know at a certain level once we started doing them in the US and
[30:17.420 --> 30:24.620]  Every every time I was involved. I didn't there was never anything. I never saw any kind of shenanigans along those lines
[30:25.340 --> 30:30.200]  but you know, I think that also goes back to the Amsterdam cups because there was a
[30:30.860 --> 30:35.800]  coffee shop competition and there's the seed company competition and the coffee shop competition is more of a
[30:36.020 --> 30:42.420]  Kind of marketing promotion who gives away the most free stuff, you know that tended to be won by you know
[30:42.420 --> 30:49.200]  The bigger shops greenhouse or one of two shops or Barney's, you know, or you know way back in the day. It could have been
[30:51.520 --> 30:57.540]  You know the dam cringe, you know and a couple other shops were competing the noon gray area
[30:58.560 --> 31:03.320]  But really it did come down to the two big kind of shops. And so in that way
[31:03.320 --> 31:08.260]  I think change that all right green place did come in and kind of shake that up a bit
[31:08.600 --> 31:14.160]  but again with a lot of giveaways and promotion and so it I think that gave
[31:14.520 --> 31:20.040]  Some people the idea that okay. Well, you know anybody can come and judge and and you know
[31:20.040 --> 31:23.960]  The whoever gives away the most is gonna win but that's particularly I think
[31:24.400 --> 31:29.780]  To the one, you know, the People's Cup that the people's choice rather than you know seed company competition
[31:29.780 --> 31:34.840]  That's really being judged by experts or at least what you know, what you hope are gonna be experts
[31:35.060 --> 31:39.860]  And that's a changing group year after year. It's not really the same people over and over so
[31:40.700 --> 31:44.580]  You know, I could definitely see trends certain years where you know
[31:44.580 --> 31:49.820]  A certain new strain would would be out and it would be all you know hyped and and you know
[31:49.860 --> 31:51.860]  Suddenly that would be the winner
[31:51.980 --> 31:58.820]  In every cup tangy was a great example. I think that's an example for sure of something that was new and different
[31:59.420 --> 32:01.180]  and
[32:01.180 --> 32:06.160]  You know in a sea of kind of, you know similar sativa entries a lot of hazy kind of strains
[32:06.380 --> 32:10.980]  That's gonna stick out and be oh, wow. This you know, this is different, you know, and
[32:12.500 --> 32:16.360]  So I think you know those tangy strains and crosses of that
[32:17.020 --> 32:20.380]  had a like a good run there of like sativa wins because of
[32:21.020 --> 32:27.040]  Newness and and and being a great still being great strain as well. But also, you know being new and different
[32:27.800 --> 32:31.000]  Well in so many people were growing tangy at the time
[32:31.000 --> 32:35.680]  It was something that was out there and it was something that there was a lot of people growing it and there was a lot
[32:35.680 --> 32:42.200]  Of good growers growing it. It's fetching a high dollar amount. It was like every cup DNA was walking up on stage like
[32:43.000 --> 32:49.280]  Extract flour it was nuts, you know, they had a really good run and now nobody wants tangy. It doesn't get you high
[32:49.280 --> 32:51.280]  It's like people are like
[32:51.440 --> 32:55.640]  I like the terps of tangy. I feel like it is somewhat linear
[32:56.480 --> 33:01.280]  You know, it was exciting to see it back in the day when it when it did have its run but uh
[33:01.920 --> 33:04.320]  You know, what's your thoughts on tangy now? I
[33:05.400 --> 33:08.040]  mean, I like it and it's it's
[33:08.840 --> 33:11.400]  It wasn't always my you know, number one go to
[33:12.240 --> 33:15.480]  Sativa, but you know, I like it and because it's kind of unique and different
[33:15.480 --> 33:20.440]  I think it has its its place in the pantheon of particular flavors
[33:21.280 --> 33:27.520]  But it's not not really my like go to my particular cup of tea that you know
[33:28.600 --> 33:34.120]  In that in that category specifically, which I judged a lot, you know, I mean to me sativa
[33:35.040 --> 33:37.040]  Category is really about effect
[33:37.840 --> 33:39.840]  It should taste good. It should smell good
[33:40.600 --> 33:43.720]  But I've smoked some really incredible
[33:44.520 --> 33:49.440]  Sativas that looked awful or didn't look like cup winners
[33:49.600 --> 33:55.280]  But I never smoked the grinspoon that I got back. I think I shared it with everybody that I got it in like 2013
[33:55.280 --> 34:01.240]  I ended up getting an ounce of grinspoon for I think it was like a thousand dollars and was handing it out there
[34:01.240 --> 34:06.360]  It was these little pea-sized. Yeah in the bag and the fact is you know
[34:07.280 --> 34:12.440]  Lipidation, right? Right. I mean pure sativa kind of, you know would freak people out sometimes
[34:12.440 --> 34:17.720]  I mean, you know people would have panic attacks smoking it because they it's not a feeling that you're expecting from
[34:18.040 --> 34:21.720]  Cannabis in many cases and to me that's you know
[34:22.040 --> 34:28.760]  The ultimate sativa is is that you know, like kind of lowland or highland Thai, you know or Vietnamese?
[34:29.480 --> 34:31.480]  African, you know Durban or
[34:32.360 --> 34:35.800]  Nigerian kind of heart racing, you know kind of
[34:37.000 --> 34:40.120]  Almost freaks you out a little bit weed. Yeah
[34:41.560 --> 34:43.320]  To in so
[34:43.320 --> 34:49.280]  That sativa category is so much more to me about effect and then you know indica to me
[34:49.280 --> 34:53.800]  of course about effect, but also, you know bag appeal and and trichomes and
[34:54.360 --> 34:59.520]  All of that as well. And so I hate the bag appeal cat the fact that for me
[35:00.200 --> 35:02.960]  Yeah, I mean if we could just get rid of do blind tasting
[35:02.960 --> 35:06.480]  I think that would be the best because you'd get the effect when you get the flavor
[35:06.520 --> 35:12.580]  It goes back to like the 90s really in a weird way. I mean that's having been there back in those days
[35:12.980 --> 35:18.180]  You know what we grew for was different, you know, everybody wanted short fast flowering
[35:18.780 --> 35:25.100]  strains that were like 45 or 50 days that would stay short and stocky and fill out real nice and it was about
[35:25.500 --> 35:27.780]  You know speed and bag appeal
[35:28.500 --> 35:32.180]  No, and that that's changed a lot, which I think is great
[35:32.180 --> 35:34.180]  and I think concentrates played a major role because
[35:34.540 --> 35:40.100]  You know the best concentrate makers have no interest at all in bag appeal. It's all about surface area and
[35:41.100 --> 35:45.220]  Essential oil production and being able to get to those essential oils
[35:45.220 --> 35:48.500]  So what we thought of as like nice dense, you know
[35:48.820 --> 35:56.940]  Indica chunky nuggets are like frowned upon if you're trying to turn something, you know, turn that into a high quality concentrate
[35:58.420 --> 36:00.380]  So that's and that's a good thing
[36:00.380 --> 36:03.780]  I think you know because it really did it really did launch, you know
[36:03.780 --> 36:10.820]  The whole flavor revolution and the turp, you know the quest for turps, which to me is is really what what makes
[36:11.540 --> 36:13.300]  different canvas interesting
[36:13.300 --> 36:17.060]  Yeah, and the turpines are really what gives it the effect as far as I'm concerned
[36:17.780 --> 36:21.380]  The unique effect. I mean, yeah exactly you paired with THC
[36:22.180 --> 36:24.180]  right, it's turpines and
[36:24.420 --> 36:30.820]  you know flavonoids and all yeah all of those things in conjunction with you know, THC and
[36:31.500 --> 36:37.220]  CBN and everything else that makes it unique and different and you know the effect of
[36:38.180 --> 36:40.380]  You know one strain to another
[36:41.340 --> 36:42.420]  totally
[36:42.420 --> 36:44.260]  So what's your favorite?
[36:44.260 --> 36:45.540]  favorite
[36:45.540 --> 36:50.580]  Cultivar out of all the ones that you've smoked over the years if you could pick one, right?
[36:50.580 --> 36:57.180]  I mean you're in New York. So I would say sour diesel. Well, you know as a grower I wouldn't say that but
[36:57.580 --> 37:04.100]  Just because it's kind of finicky, you know grow wise but certainly, you know money wise
[37:04.100 --> 37:10.580]  That's what you would get the most for out here. I love strawberry cough. It's usually my go-to answer to that question
[37:10.580 --> 37:17.000]  I grew it for many years. I you know, it's unique. It's different the high cut to Cushman or
[37:17.500 --> 37:23.000]  I got it through him actually know he and some friends here on the East that have kind of kept it alive for years
[37:24.000 --> 37:28.160]  But yeah, I know I got it through through him he was a mentor of mine at high times
[37:29.080 --> 37:31.080]  You know, he left in oh four
[37:32.480 --> 37:38.960]  And you know, I was like I couldn't believe it, you know, he's gonna how do you quit your dream job? I
[37:39.760 --> 37:44.320]  Guess I understand now, but at the time I couldn't believe it, you know, and he you know
[37:44.320 --> 37:48.820]  He's done amazing things since but yeah, he sort of discovered that strain in Connecticut
[37:49.220 --> 37:56.100]  Through some friends grow our friends up there and then we just kept it alive and it was just never hermed out never misbehaved
[37:56.300 --> 37:58.100]  you know just
[37:58.100 --> 38:00.780]  Behaved exactly the same way for years and years and years
[38:01.940 --> 38:08.820]  the smell the taste, you know, just never suffered from any kind of you know drift whether it be genetic or
[38:09.900 --> 38:14.900]  Otherwise, you know, like I don't really believe in genetic drift. I think it's more of like, you know
[38:15.020 --> 38:20.260]  Things like traumas of the past that are carried through the cells of the plant rather than
[38:21.020 --> 38:24.220]  An actual shift in genes, you know, it's more
[38:25.660 --> 38:27.220]  You know
[38:27.220 --> 38:33.820]  Basically image to the plant right just damage over years and things. I mean, I kind of think those are those are environmental like so
[38:34.340 --> 38:35.540]  epigenetics
[38:35.540 --> 38:40.900]  Right through generations epigenetic changes that can stay with the plant right which is one of the cool things about
[38:41.380 --> 38:47.220]  You know tissue culture is that now, you know, you can basically go back to the original form and
[38:47.780 --> 38:50.460]  and bring that back out and and and kind of
[38:51.980 --> 38:54.460]  Release a plant from a lot of the you know
[38:54.980 --> 38:59.060]  Generational sort of diseases and things that it's picked up over the years
[38:59.780 --> 39:02.820]  If you bring it back down to a cellular level and and out
[39:03.900 --> 39:07.260]  In many cases you can reverse any any sort of you know
[39:07.260 --> 39:13.820]  Yeah, it's pretty impressive what some of these guys are dealing with things like hoplate and where they're getting rid of hoplate and viroid
[39:14.460 --> 39:21.460]  Through tissue culture, right? I mean, yeah, these are things that are systemic and and and so they stay with that plant forever
[39:21.460 --> 39:23.460]  if you keep taking cuts, but
[39:23.500 --> 39:28.500]  If you do it at a molecular level with tissue cultures, you know
[39:28.500 --> 39:33.500]  You can get rid of that plant and you can get rid of that plant. You can get rid of that plant
[39:33.500 --> 39:40.140]  If you do it at a molecular level with tissue culture you you can you can get rid of it and
[39:41.340 --> 39:47.540]  Some strains, you know that we've lost over the years because of things like that. We won't we don't necessarily have to lose in the future
[39:48.340 --> 39:50.340]  Yeah, I mean, I think most of my
[39:50.860 --> 39:58.540]  Losses in genetics were from not having a good solid nursery and it being a black market type thing now moving into the white market
[39:58.660 --> 40:00.980]  It's much easier to keep stuff alive
[40:01.860 --> 40:03.740]  Tissue culture to clean stuff is amazing
[40:03.740 --> 40:07.580]  There's only a handful of people in my opinion to do a really good job with tissue culture
[40:07.900 --> 40:11.740]  You know my friend my friend Justin from DSG labs. He does an amazing job
[40:13.220 --> 40:18.180]  You know, he's pretty humble about it for the most part. He doesn't talk about who he works with. I love that
[40:18.660 --> 40:22.140]  But yeah, I mean him cleaning the hop hoplate and virides big deal
[40:22.900 --> 40:26.380]  You know and I think we weren't even talking about virides five years ago
[40:26.940 --> 40:31.300]  You know and now we're talking about virides and viruses and I mean all these things pythium
[40:32.100 --> 40:38.500]  You know aspergillus even you know, but it's because you know, the intellectual property is so valuable
[40:39.100 --> 40:42.220]  And when it's genetic and it can be lost like that
[40:42.220 --> 40:49.660]  I mean, you know that is losing a particular strain can be you know, losing millions of dollars in
[40:50.180 --> 40:53.900]  Millions. Yeah, you know the potential for many more men and so
[40:54.820 --> 41:01.780]  Now or you know on a pharmaceutical level billions, right so that's you know, that is exciting and
[41:02.660 --> 41:09.100]  Yet again another one of the things that you know have developed in the last 20 years in this exciting industry
[41:09.100 --> 41:11.580]  That's gone from underground to
[41:12.220 --> 41:13.300]  essential
[41:13.300 --> 41:20.740]  Yeah, we've seen it happen. It's pretty it's amazing to be alive at this time in this plants existence
[41:20.740 --> 41:22.740]  It really it really is
[41:23.100 --> 41:28.860]  It's amazing that our industry is considered, you know essential in kovat times, I mean that's just
[41:29.460 --> 41:34.340]  It's a it's a thing of beauty right there. It's so many contradictions right like one state
[41:34.580 --> 41:42.100]  Jail, you can go to jail in Texas, you know for 25 years for growing 20 plants and then one state over in Oklahoma
[41:42.100 --> 41:45.140]  You can become a millionaire, you know and people are losing their
[41:45.860 --> 41:52.580]  Instagrams and their Facebook's because they're posting pictures of cannabis and yet, you know, they're huge stars on Instagram and Facebook
[41:53.020 --> 41:55.300]  it's just we are in a time of
[41:56.100 --> 41:58.660]  the ultimate contradictions, you know as far as
[41:59.180 --> 42:04.820]  It's it's legal and essential. It's illegal and harmful and it's all it's everything
[42:04.820 --> 42:09.980]  You know anything people want to call it it is because in one place or another it is, you know in Indonesia
[42:09.980 --> 42:11.980]  It's a death sentence in
[42:12.620 --> 42:18.540]  You know in Spain, it's a pharmaceutical, you know thing that they're doing
[42:18.540 --> 42:21.300]  you know acres and acres and millions of acres, so
[42:21.780 --> 42:23.780]  It really is just weird how
[42:24.500 --> 42:26.820]  you know how vilified and
[42:27.820 --> 42:29.860]  Celebrated something can be at the same time
[42:31.220 --> 42:38.940]  Yeah, it's funny because I knew that and once we passed medical in 96 in California that it was gonna be legal someday and
[42:40.020 --> 42:43.460]  Then it was like five years later. I'm like, I don't know how long it's gonna take it
[42:43.460 --> 42:48.740]  Hopefully in my lifetime and now we're there, you know, it's like it's pretty amazing the progress
[42:49.460 --> 42:51.420]  You know
[42:51.420 --> 42:56.660]  Dennis Perrone and guys like that that you know help with the legislation in California kind of moving that forward
[42:57.180 --> 42:59.980]  You know and now we're at a point where you know
[42:59.980 --> 43:05.500]  I really see the United States in the next five years it being accepted definitely on a medical
[43:05.500 --> 43:09.860]  You know a hundred percent across the board medical. It's gonna be in every state. It's gonna be federally
[43:09.860 --> 43:10.340]  You know
[43:10.340 --> 43:16.520]  They're gonna have to change a lot of laws and I think part of that is is the schedule one a lot of other drug
[43:16.680 --> 43:24.520]  Penalties are based on cannabis crime. So basically, you know if you have X amount of cocaine they compare that to kilos of marijuana
[43:24.600 --> 43:31.080]  So they have to rewrite all kinds of stuff. Oh, yeah, and you know, we've we've got such a long way to go
[43:31.080 --> 43:33.320]  I mean like there's still nonviolent cannabis
[43:33.880 --> 43:40.160]  Prisoners in jail and there's still you know people with that on their records and there's still there those people aren't allowed to enter into
[43:40.160 --> 43:42.440]  this industry which in many states which is
[43:42.920 --> 43:49.960]  Crazy and and you know, I I don't necessarily want legal cannabis to be just me being able to go to a
[43:50.640 --> 43:52.160]  dispensary and buy cannabis
[43:52.160 --> 43:57.720]  I want to be able to go to a farmers market and buy cannabis or to a farm stand on the side of the road
[43:58.400 --> 44:01.960]  and buy cannabis or to a food a co-op where
[44:02.360 --> 44:06.480]  Me and some friends all kind of pool our resources and you know
[44:06.480 --> 44:12.080]  One person grows cannabis and one grows tomatoes and you know one grows beans and we all share
[44:12.080 --> 44:14.080]  I mean, that's the
[44:14.400 --> 44:18.720]  Legal marketplace doesn't just mean being able to go to a store and buy it. It means I can grow it
[44:18.720 --> 44:21.440]  It means I can share it, you know
[44:22.400 --> 44:24.400]  there's a lot more to it I think and
[44:25.360 --> 44:31.720]  We've got a long way to go before we get there. But certainly, you know, we're well on our way and
[44:32.200 --> 44:36.000]  You're right. I do it schedule is the most important thing. Yeah, we need to get up
[44:36.000 --> 44:41.800]  So you're moving it to a different schedule, you know schedule two or three where other drugs are but taking it off the schedule because
[44:42.080 --> 44:45.760]  You know nicotine is not on a schedule. Alcohol is not on a schedule
[44:47.120 --> 44:51.560]  Caffeine is not on a schedule and that's where cannabis resides, you know
[44:51.840 --> 44:58.640]  It's it's not in the realm of something that doctors need to be worried about. It's like a herbal supplement, you know
[44:58.640 --> 45:03.880]  Totally. Well, you hear about Richard D'Alesi. He's gonna be released from prison in the next couple months. I believe he's the longest
[45:05.200 --> 45:06.840]  longest sitting
[45:06.840 --> 45:13.400]  Prisoner from the the war on drugs and from cannabis. Yeah, and he will be released a Rick Rick D'Alesi
[45:13.400 --> 45:16.600]  I know him from Amsterdam and for my friend Pelly
[45:17.600 --> 45:21.640]  In fact, he introduced me to Pelly actually, but but yeah, he's gonna be released
[45:21.720 --> 45:26.280]  You know, I think there's a gofundme page for him if you look up last prisoner project
[45:26.720 --> 45:33.380]  Yeah, it's outrageous how many people are locked up and and you also have to think that these are non-violent people
[45:33.380 --> 45:40.820]  You know what? I mean being put in a situation where sometimes violence is, you know is all around you and you know, that's
[45:41.900 --> 45:44.720]  It's just it's shameful that we've done that to people
[45:45.340 --> 45:49.340]  And there's so many, you know, D'Alesi's out there
[45:49.340 --> 45:55.020]  I mean, he's an example because it's the longest serving but so many others serving so long and
[45:55.820 --> 45:59.420]  You know separated from their families, you know for all those years
[45:59.980 --> 46:02.860]  It's it's you know, it's outrageous
[46:02.860 --> 46:08.180]  it's really the fact that anybody's in jail for non-violent cannabis offenses is is a
[46:08.580 --> 46:12.060]  stain on our society all of us and and
[46:12.540 --> 46:17.060]  You know, not only that but people that get out that can't get transplants or that, you know
[46:17.100 --> 46:20.860]  Have their homes raided and their dogs are killed and all just there's so many
[46:21.340 --> 46:24.580]  There's so many injustices to the war on this flower
[46:25.300 --> 46:32.020]  And you know having worked at high times all those years we had a lot of great times and great moments and incredible
[46:32.700 --> 46:34.220]  things but we also
[46:34.220 --> 46:37.420]  Saw the saddest things and got the worst phone calls
[46:38.540 --> 46:42.660]  where you'd find out about people getting raided or murdered or
[46:44.380 --> 46:50.700]  Separated from their families and just you know outrage after outrage and it goes on and on and on and and
[46:51.300 --> 46:56.700]  You know ultimately that's really what what drove you know, what drove the magazine and
[46:57.660 --> 47:04.260]  Almost every activist you talked to was inspired by either themselves being arrested or a family member
[47:04.940 --> 47:11.860]  And just it's not justice. That's you know, we're cannabis consumers and not criminals and it's an outrage
[47:12.980 --> 47:19.580]  Well, yeah, and you were there through the whole with Matt Stang and him getting in trouble and right. Yeah, I mean, you know
[47:19.900 --> 47:26.180]  Yeah, there was always, you know, they're always targeting the magazine and particular the advertisers in some cases
[47:26.180 --> 47:29.380]  I mean there was operation green merchant that went after all the hydro
[47:29.980 --> 47:31.980]  people back in the late 80s
[47:32.100 --> 47:38.500]  That basically, you know trying to cripple high times by taking out the hydro industry, which never really I mean
[47:39.340 --> 47:45.780]  Now even still remembers, you know green merchant as being one of those pivotal moments and then you know
[47:45.780 --> 47:49.460]  The glass thing with Tommy Chong in the mid 90s as well
[47:50.260 --> 47:52.740]  Actually the 2000s that was the Bush
[47:53.300 --> 47:58.100]  Thing an Ashcroft so, you know, they went after the glass people at that point
[47:58.100 --> 48:03.820]  So, you know, they they can't attack the messenger because you're protected by the First Amendment
[48:03.820 --> 48:08.060]  But they can attack the businesses and even now as we know they're attacking
[48:08.300 --> 48:12.540]  You know people on Facebook that post pictures of cannabis in legal states
[48:13.220 --> 48:16.340]  You know, it's the stigma remains
[48:17.100 --> 48:19.100]  We've done a great job. I
[48:19.540 --> 48:21.740]  Think in changing the public's mind
[48:22.340 --> 48:28.080]  But the stigma remains, you know with people that you know are religious or with people that you know
[48:28.500 --> 48:30.900]  Think that somehow, you know cannabis
[48:32.500 --> 48:38.100]  You know destroys law and order which it does not so, you know
[48:38.100 --> 48:41.300]  You know, we we got a long way to go and we've come a long way and
[48:41.860 --> 48:47.540]  You know as long as we keep the plant in, you know central and don't make it about people don't make it about
[48:48.860 --> 48:54.860]  Any particular individuals or you know leaders or anything else and just keep the plant as the focus
[48:54.860 --> 48:56.860]  I think you know, we'll get there one day
[48:57.980 --> 49:01.100]  Yeah, I agree. We're gonna get there. It's just time now
[49:01.740 --> 49:02.660]  really, uh
[49:02.660 --> 49:05.780]  You know, it's not not necessarily the waiting game. We don't want to wait around
[49:05.780 --> 49:10.060]  Oh, yeah, you know and I it's it's because of all these passionate people and
[49:10.660 --> 49:15.700]  You know, I I kind of it in some ways it sucks that some of these people haven't found their way
[49:15.700 --> 49:18.940]  I see guys in California that I've been going to cups with
[49:19.580 --> 49:20.740]  You know
[49:20.740 --> 49:27.580]  that haven't found their way into the licensed that are kind of trying to get you find their way and it's it's been a struggle and
[49:27.580 --> 49:32.220]  Then we have these big corporations coming in that have been in the game for three years
[49:32.220 --> 49:38.060]  And so, you know, I mean, but you can see that coming that that's just a part of you know
[49:38.620 --> 49:43.100]  Being in the legitimate, you know world and coming out of the underground, you know for every
[49:44.300 --> 49:50.260]  Moonshiner, you know, there can only be one, you know Budweiser or projecting or sure Jack Daniels and
[49:50.900 --> 49:52.580]  You know it
[49:52.580 --> 49:56.260]  Not everybody can you know that there's not everybody can do it
[49:56.260 --> 50:02.100]  But I think it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's
[50:02.380 --> 50:05.420]  Space in the industry for everybody in that way
[50:05.940 --> 50:09.860]  Either you know what? I mean? And so we vote with our pocketbooks, you know
[50:10.260 --> 50:14.420]  What you choose to buy and consume is what will you know?
[50:14.940 --> 50:16.940]  ultimately continue to be
[50:17.660 --> 50:22.100]  Sold to you, right? So if you demand, you know properly grown
[50:22.700 --> 50:28.940]  Small batch local cannabis that's done right then and you're willing to pay a little extra for it in some cases
[50:28.940 --> 50:30.380]  That's what you'll get
[50:30.380 --> 50:34.180]  And if you want, you know mids produced in huge factories
[50:35.260 --> 50:41.140]  And overfed and you know kind of not cared for that's what you'll get as well
[50:41.140 --> 50:47.400]  So it's it's really up to us to as consumers, you know, I'd rather buy a jar and you know, beautiful
[50:48.060 --> 50:54.740]  Ounce from you know, my local farmers that grew it, you know here that with love and care
[50:56.260 --> 50:58.260]  Rather than you know
[50:58.940 --> 51:03.900]  Buy it from a company that grew it in a 200 square thousand square foot warehouse
[51:04.940 --> 51:06.940]  with robots
[51:06.980 --> 51:08.980]  totally, and I think that
[51:09.460 --> 51:16.740]  The big disconnect is the you know education. I believe the consumers are becoming more educated especially in California
[51:16.740 --> 51:21.540]  I think Colorado and Seattle Colorado and Washington have really you know
[51:21.540 --> 51:24.620]  their consumers a lot more educated than they were when they first became
[51:25.260 --> 51:31.700]  Legal for recreational and California is definitely going that way and it's always the the guys with the most money they get to market first
[51:31.700 --> 51:33.700]  but that's not necessarily the best products and
[51:34.060 --> 51:40.340]  I see it in California that people are demanding stuff more than just THC. We're street. Uh, I'm just
[51:41.060 --> 51:46.300]  That one bothers me the most that we're so THC driven the high THC. We want the high THC
[51:46.300 --> 51:51.220]  Well, that's not always the best stuff. Now. There are some instances where there are certain varieties fat
[51:51.220 --> 51:55.180]  so from Canerado that finest finest sells the
[51:55.700 --> 52:00.820]  The tissue culture starts of those but that variety in the rec market, you know, you're looking at stuff
[52:00.820 --> 52:05.900]  That's over 30% THC that packs the punch it backs it up. It's got the chirps. It's got the punch
[52:06.420 --> 52:10.740]  but that's not always the case and I feel like a lot of that it has to do with
[52:11.740 --> 52:13.740]  knowledge and information and
[52:13.900 --> 52:17.380]  Consumers actually trying stuff over and over developing their palates
[52:17.820 --> 52:24.600]  So, you know, we're getting new new customers in this industry every day people are curious about gummies
[52:24.600 --> 52:28.940]  I was talking to a guy that was 70 years old and he's into gummies, you know
[52:28.940 --> 52:33.660]  and it's I've been working on formulating these gummy recipes and trying to you know
[52:33.660 --> 52:40.060]  we're getting licensed here in Oakland to do some gummies and so I've been working on some formulations with one of my buddies and
[52:40.780 --> 52:46.820]  I got this guy who's like 70 years old and he's he's big into you know, he loves the effect of it
[52:47.380 --> 52:51.580]  So it's like we're the industry's gaining customers as as it goes every day
[52:52.380 --> 52:57.060]  Yeah, a hundred percent and you know in those gummies are huge
[52:58.620 --> 53:02.460]  Everyone you know all the in-laws and everybody's always asking me about
[53:04.220 --> 53:08.340]  Gummies, you know, it's like a 10 milligram gummy, you know, you take two or three of those and
[53:09.180 --> 53:14.180]  If you need to add one you can add one, you know, you're not necessarily going way overboard
[53:14.860 --> 53:18.700]  With something like that, so I think you know, it's a great entry-level thing for people
[53:20.140 --> 53:24.740]  But as you mentioned, you know that whole THC based the idea of that, you know being
[53:25.900 --> 53:29.540]  How people choose what they want to smoke is is definitely
[53:31.020 --> 53:34.720]  Falling by the wayside as as the consumer becomes more educated
[53:34.720 --> 53:39.940]  And I think the best example of that is I you know, I actually have tried pure THC and it's it's kind of boring
[53:40.940 --> 53:47.820]  You know what I mean when it's just pure isolate isolated THC it's like yeah, I mean sure it's like there's an effect there but
[53:48.340 --> 53:51.440]  what makes it interesting is the you know, the
[53:52.380 --> 53:57.200]  cooperation or the conjunction of all the other terpenes and flavonoids and you know
[53:57.200 --> 54:03.700]  That's why people always talk about full spectrum and you know whole plant medicine and all the buzzwords, but it's it's true
[54:03.700 --> 54:05.700]  I mean entourage effect, you know
[54:06.140 --> 54:12.860]  These are all phrases that we hear all the time and kind of seem almost overused but the reality is you know
[54:12.980 --> 54:14.980]  You can isolate everything out
[54:15.500 --> 54:23.060]  and and and find you know, what each thing is is helpful for but it's the combination of those things is what
[54:23.860 --> 54:30.380]  What makes a particular cultivar, you know interesting or hash from that cultivar or you know
[54:30.780 --> 54:32.780]  Whatever it is that you make from it
[54:33.380 --> 54:40.180]  Ultimately, it's it's a result of a bunch of things interacting rather than just 30% THC, right?
[54:40.300 --> 54:43.020]  Well, and then so I have a product like this right here
[54:43.220 --> 54:49.100]  So this if you guys can see it this looks like hard drugs of some sort and it's THC a and I take it for
[54:49.300 --> 54:55.180]  As medicine for my ulcerative colitis, I take it orally in pills and it has no psychoactive effect
[54:55.380 --> 55:00.180]  But by itself, it doesn't work that well. It works well with other cannabinoids
[55:00.180 --> 55:03.900]  I you know, I smoke a lot. So this with the what I smoke and then CBD
[55:04.500 --> 55:06.500]  You know, we're just learning about all this stuff
[55:07.180 --> 55:12.360]  Yeah, so and and it's the other thing is is also subjective to the individual, right?
[55:12.360 --> 55:17.700]  I mean, that's an important thing that we touch on a lot is that the same strain that makes one person, you know
[55:18.060 --> 55:21.580]  Hungry makes it suppresses another person's appetite. It really has
[55:22.180 --> 55:24.540]  It's so it's harder to quantify in many cases
[55:24.540 --> 55:29.980]  I think that makes it difficult for some of the you know labs and scientists to quantify because
[55:30.820 --> 55:36.260]  Because of that, you know because they're so used to this does this this does this but you know
[55:36.260 --> 55:42.980]  The human body and our risk our cannabinoid receptors are different within our bodies some some for some people
[55:43.300 --> 55:45.300]  you know cannabis doesn't
[55:45.420 --> 55:47.900]  doesn't affect them the way it does you and me and and
[55:48.540 --> 55:55.540]  you know, it's not for everybody but certainly people people can benefit from it and its compounds in a lot of ways, but
[55:56.540 --> 56:01.900]  There's still some mystery around, you know how it behaves and how it affects us
[56:02.820 --> 56:08.060]  So how many milligrams if you're gonna eat an edible? What what is your choice amount of milligrams?
[56:08.540 --> 56:10.980]  You know, I try to stay under a hundred
[56:11.700 --> 56:14.460]  I really do because I've definitely had some
[56:15.580 --> 56:17.580]  experiences with overdoing it
[56:17.780 --> 56:19.740]  Especially at you know, the cannabis cups
[56:19.740 --> 56:26.180]  I learned early on to really dial down the edible use at cups because it just
[56:26.380 --> 56:29.980]  Continues to add up and compound and and there's just so much of it available
[56:30.540 --> 56:32.460]  Even if you're doing a couple, you know
[56:32.460 --> 56:38.380]  Ten milligrams here ten milligrams there by the end of the day. It really can add up to a lot and so
[56:39.460 --> 56:45.740]  Yeah, I mean if I'm doing gummies, I'll do three or four ten milligram gummies and see how they'll make me feel
[56:46.340 --> 56:48.340]  And then maybe add a couple more in
[56:49.260 --> 56:53.220]  After I know I didn't I didn't already go overboard, but I'm kind of a lightweight
[56:53.220 --> 56:57.620]  I mean I have friends that you know, you mentioned Dan sky. He's unaffected by edibles
[56:58.220 --> 57:02.140]  Yeah, anything like it he could eat him and eat him and eat him and nothing happens
[57:03.380 --> 57:06.900]  but you know, I've never been you know, the the
[57:07.540 --> 57:12.420]  5-gram dab guy or the you know, let's see how many thousands of milligrams we can eat
[57:12.540 --> 57:16.900]  You know, I like to get high like, you know, I like to smoke weed all day
[57:16.900 --> 57:23.260]  You know, I mean, I like to I like joints. I like to kind of sip on cannabis. I don't need you know
[57:25.300 --> 57:30.220]  Gravity bong hits for instance, you know anything like to me. It's just it's like whoa
[57:30.980 --> 57:32.980]  It's a lot all at once
[57:33.380 --> 57:35.380]  you know where I just kind of I
[57:36.180 --> 57:40.140]  Can't say I spread it out because I do it all all day all the time. But
[57:40.820 --> 57:43.260]  But I don't do it, you know in huge
[57:44.060 --> 57:46.060]  massive, you know Instagram
[57:46.980 --> 57:48.980]  friendly doses
[57:49.220 --> 57:51.220]  Yeah, you're not doing the
[57:51.980 --> 57:55.660]  Strings that are like that long of X yet. Yeah, if it ends with the word challenge
[57:57.140 --> 58:05.060]  I'm probably not gonna be involved in that if it's if it's like tasting, you know, maybe maybe I'm in but challenge not so much
[58:05.940 --> 58:08.340]  So do you do you have specific varieties?
[58:08.340 --> 58:14.300]  Do you like to smoke in the morning and or at night as opposed to just smoking? Whatever is good in that moment?
[58:14.940 --> 58:17.380]  Yeah, I mean certainly I'm you know
[58:17.940 --> 58:23.820]  Do you know the whole sativa ninica thing like as you and I know and a lot of people at this point?
[58:24.460 --> 58:32.140]  Understand this is pretty much a gross oversimplification of what of the interplay that we're talking about with all these different compounds
[58:32.700 --> 58:40.380]  But you know, but it's it's it's shorthand. So, you know haze is super lemon haze something like lemony and fruity
[58:40.980 --> 58:42.540]  during the day
[58:42.540 --> 58:49.500]  Is nice for me with the coffee and all of that and then you know as the day shifts into evening
[58:49.500 --> 58:54.140]  I was shift into more of a gassy fuel II, you know chem
[58:55.020 --> 58:58.620]  Families is something, you know, I smoke a lot of
[58:59.540 --> 59:01.940]  You know chem 91 chem D
[59:02.860 --> 59:04.860]  chem sister
[59:05.900 --> 59:12.260]  You know, those are just staples out here in the east and sour of course would fit into that that realm as well
[59:13.300 --> 59:19.020]  But I mix it up though, you know what? I mean? Like I don't it's not really I'm not really that strict about it
[59:19.020 --> 59:21.020]  I mean, I like to get a
[59:21.500 --> 59:29.260]  Nice buzz, you know before watching a movie or pretty much, you know, any kind of excursion, you know anything really? So
[59:29.780 --> 59:34.740]  I like to I like to mix it up. I don't like to smoke the same thing over and over all the time
[59:34.740 --> 59:37.340]  I think you know people kind of develop a tolerance
[59:38.020 --> 59:43.500]  Or at least I'd eventually develop sort of a tolerance or it's just not as interesting if it's the same thing
[59:45.140 --> 59:48.860]  But I go through different phases I think we all kind of go through phases of what we
[59:49.460 --> 59:51.780]  what we enjoy at a particular time and
[59:52.900 --> 59:58.820]  Lately, it's been you know for me a lot of that chem family stuff just real
[01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:02.020]  strong
[01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:04.300]  You know
[01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:06.300]  gassy fuel flavors
[01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:11.480]  With the that that whole term profile of the chem family
[01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:19.420]  So I have a great question THC or THC sir, one of our good mutual friends. He's worked with high times
[01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:23.860]  He is very much against og and loves chem dog
[01:00:24.140 --> 01:00:29.820]  He's very much against is like I can't remember if it's camera better or whatever his his hashtag was
[01:00:29.820 --> 01:00:37.040]  But he's like og sucks and chem is real and you know, what's what you like og as well, correct? I like og
[01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:40.420]  Yeah, I will I like og
[01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:45.660]  You know, there's occasions where there's ogs that are real like earthy
[01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:49.380]  and those get a little I
[01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:54.220]  Don't know. There's certain times where where they're just a little bit too
[01:00:56.020 --> 01:00:58.020]  It's hard for me to describe
[01:00:58.140 --> 01:01:00.140]  Just kind of weird, but it's like an earthiness
[01:01:00.940 --> 01:01:03.980]  That they have that's like less fuel and more
[01:01:04.780 --> 01:01:06.780]  Yeah, pine pine
[01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:15.380]  Yeah, and and that to me kind of isn't as enjoyable as you know the kind of more lemony
[01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:18.700]  ogs and the more fuel
[01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:21.540]  kind of ogs than the piney
[01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:29.060]  just the piney thing just reminds me of like the 90s and like I don't know that just the kind of
[01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:34.500]  The the strains I didn't want to smoke back then yeah, I
[01:01:35.380 --> 01:01:41.740]  Love pine. I love I love it when it's gas pine and lemon and in a hits. That's a good combo
[01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:46.580]  Yeah, all of those for sure. But when the pine sort of overpowers everything
[01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:53.060]  Yeah for me is like and it's a earthy pine earthy pine. You're burning pine cones or whatever, right?
[01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:55.060]  Okay
[01:01:55.620 --> 01:01:58.860]  That's OG yeah, yeah, totally
[01:01:59.540 --> 01:02:05.620]  The chem side I think you know the the fuel and the and the lemon side shines through more
[01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:07.500]  What's interesting with that too?
[01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:14.300]  Because that OG, you know, there was only OG Kush back in the day and OG seeds didn't come out for a really long time
[01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:17.560]  People weren't breeding heavily with OG Kush
[01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:21.020]  I mean, I think people were holding on to it
[01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:26.860]  But there was not a lot of breeding going on and then there was this huge influx of OG Kush varieties coming out
[01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:31.540]  And then even still they didn't have a good OG Kush seed for many many years
[01:02:31.540 --> 01:02:37.040]  And now you can find a bunch of seeds that are very much representative of what I like about OG Kush
[01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:40.540]  So someone I think blue dream when I think pine
[01:02:41.380 --> 01:02:43.380]  gasp
[01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:48.040]  Oh, man, this blue dream is one of those strains that people either love or hate
[01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:54.000]  There's just so much hate on that strain and you know it I mean when it's grown right, it's great
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:57.880]  I think part of the hate comes from the fact that just so much of it was grown and
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:04.160]  Sold and it was just it was like a flood we can blame that on our good friend Ed Rosenthal
[01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:06.040]  He like released it to the world
[01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:09.800]  He was selling clones back in the day and like that was when it was hot
[01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:13.680]  It was it was the blue dream, you know, everybody was growing it and make a bunch of money on it
[01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:19.840]  it was top top shelf top dollar and then all of a sudden the clones got out to everybody and the price just dropped on it and
[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:26.000]  People were going in dispensaries with their a-plus quality stuff and the dispensaries would be like no we don't want it
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:29.080]  We just got this stuff for 18 and you want four for your stuff?
[01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:32.800]  you're crazy, and it would be garbage for 18, but it would be the same variety and
[01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:37.520]  You know blue dream, you know, it's it's definitely a sativa. It's not something that gets you
[01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:40.840]  It's a it's an equatorial high that you get, you know
[01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:46.760]  It's very active and it's not everyone's cup of tea and then Justin Bieber had to say it was his favorite strain a couple years
[01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:48.760]  ago
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:56.080]  He kind of you know brought it back into the light and so people they don't know a lot about we were like I like I
[01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:59.100]  Like blue dream too. I like Justin Bieber. I must like blue dream
[01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:05.000]  but I mean if you think about it as a genetic and as a plant I
[01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:09.520]  Honestly feel like there's nothing that can be improved about it
[01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:11.960]  Structure wise yield wise
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:14.160]  figure
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:19.280]  Growers love it. I mean, it's one of those incredible. You just leave it alone and yeah
[01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:24.880]  Well, my friends I would give that to them if they're a first-time grower. I'd say grow glow grow blue dream
[01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:29.660]  You're gonna feel really good about yourself. You're gonna get good results try to grow OG cuz you're gonna feel like shit
[01:04:29.660 --> 01:04:31.440]  You're not gonna get good yields
[01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:33.040]  I used to tell people
[01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:39.080]  It might my saying was I was you could shit in the reservoir and you would get 2.2 pounds per thousand watt light
[01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:42.080]  I
[01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:44.080]  Think there is truth to that
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:51.520]  Yeah, I think this is the truth right here paraplegic poppy said it best is that when it's grown, right?
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:54.760]  It's great. But there's a lot of poorly grown out there
[01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:57.280]  Gives it a bad name
[01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:06.040]  And I think poorly packaged too, you know what I mean like the minute something gets compressed into bricks or you know
[01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:13.080]  Whatever even if it's lightly compressed it changes like it's not the same when you see blue dream in a glass jar
[01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:15.080]  That's never been compressed
[01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:21.200]  It's pretty, you know, it smells great and it's covered in frosty trichomes and you know
[01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:24.520]  it's just a different animal than when you see it, you know pulled out of
[01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:32.000]  you know a pack so to speak where it's been packed up and and shipped and and you know,
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000]  then it's got to be broken up again and and
[01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:38.160]  you know all it just becomes more and more dense inside the package and
[01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:40.680]  It takes some of the you know, the beauty away from it
[01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:43.480]  Yeah
[01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:49.240]  Blueberry muffin was my queen this year blueberry muffins great great variety. I think that's that's a fun one
[01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:55.640]  Yeah, we had we had it a couple years ago I even bred it with some
[01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:59.800]  OG I have a blueberry muffin times og sherbert
[01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:05.120]  That's pretty rock and I got seeds of regular seeds that I'm gonna be doing some giveaways with here
[01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:08.200]  Daggett dot love if you guys want to buy my seeds you can go to
[01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:12.160]  www.dagga da gga dot love right there
[01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:15.560]  We we had a great Black Friday special
[01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:20.720]  Seeds are back to normal price, which is kind of expensive, but you're getting high quality seeds
[01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:25.240]  So that was my little pitch for my my stuff, but yeah
[01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:30.520]  So so yeah, and I'll have to I'll have to give you some seeds Danny
[01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:34.240]  Yeah to give out to people we got so I got two new lines coming out
[01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:39.500]  One is loud canna genetics with some of my partners up in Washington, and then I have with Marlon
[01:06:40.020 --> 01:06:42.600]  You know Marlon Asher. I've got our
[01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:46.760]  Ganja farmer. Yeah, I got into farmer seed company. That's awesome
[01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:52.480]  So yeah, and him and I have been working all over we were in Spain together we were working in
[01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:56.440]  St. Vincent with the government down there and then we have friends passing
[01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:03.160]  You know legislation in Trinidad, so we will have seeds in in the Caribbean and hopefully
[01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:06.160]  Spain sometime in the near future
[01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:09.880]  That's awesome. So yeah, we got partners in those places
[01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:12.840]  Producing stuff so it's gonna be real interesting
[01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:15.400]  Yeah, yeah, I mean I love
[01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:18.240]  tropical grown cannabis it's like
[01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:21.360]  You know anything that the closer you get to the equator
[01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:27.440]  I think you know you just something about the sunshine and the soil and the wind and
[01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:29.880]  Everything just combines to make for better
[01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:34.000]  Cannabis, I mean that's what people talked about back when we were kids and you know
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:41.240]  you'd had that that Colombian gold and all those things that you know the Panama Red and will Hawken and you know, though that those are
[01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:42.520]  just
[01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:45.920]  equatorial sativa strains that grown beautifully and
[01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:52.360]  You know, there's something to be said for for tropical cannabis, I think yeah
[01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:57.000]  Pineapple Express barely talk about nowadays
[01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:03.480]  Yeah, I just think there's so many good varieties pineapple Express is definitely not. I mean, I don't I wouldn't say it's overlooked
[01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:05.800]  I would say that a lot of people aren't growing it
[01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:11.920]  But it's one of those things I love the church for pineapple Express good movie, too
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.280]  Yeah
[01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:15.840]  Yeah
[01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:18.560]  Well Peter, is there anything else to add? I think we're
[01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:24.040]  Worried about now if you guys want to take some questions
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:28.500]  There were also a while ago when you were talking about the strawberry cough people
[01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:32.760]  I mean, it's way back in the chat. So I probably can't find it but people were throwing down kind of
[01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:38.280]  What they like to grow and smoke. I think someone said if you had three seeds on a desert island
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:41.080]  What would you grow? I remember that one
[01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:44.520]  Yeah
[01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:52.720]  Very cough I would do something like a some type of a haze maybe a lemon haze of some kind and then
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:58.360]  You know something from Canada cam family because I think with those three I could kind of you know
[01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:02.720]  Maybe start start an island breeding project my own little seed company
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:07.440]  Coconut seeds coconut seeds desert island seeds. Yeah
[01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:12.080]  But uh, yeah, I mean
[01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:16.920]  The best thing you could do in that situation is have three things that are very different from each other
[01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:21.320]  I would imagine, you know, especially you know you James as a breeder
[01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:27.920]  because that way, you know, you're gonna get the most variety in the in the genetics that you produce and
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:31.200]  It's all about selection and it's interesting
[01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:35.960]  That people talk about all these strains, but a lot of the times don't understand how much
[01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:39.680]  Selection goes into it and how many strains you reject?
[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:42.280]  you know what I mean like
[01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:48.420]  You know, I number one thing that most breeders talk about is how many plants they kill
[01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:50.720]  Yeah
[01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:57.360]  Yeah, and and that's takes some getting used to when you know when you're a grower and all you want to do is keep plants alive
[01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:03.000]  It's very different than when you're a breeder and you're learning to cull, you know
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:08.740]  And then to get rid of anything that's that's undesirable or or has any you know any reasons for for not
[01:10:09.340 --> 01:10:14.420]  Sticking around well, you know and as a breeder it's tough because you know
[01:10:14.420 --> 01:10:17.820]  Let's say you're growing a hundred plants and you want to narrow it down to ten or to five
[01:10:18.300 --> 01:10:19.500]  well
[01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:23.580]  In that 70 days of flower plus whatever germination time
[01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:30.260]  You start becoming attached to the varieties and you're like, it's it's really you know, and that's why I love having outside opinions
[01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:33.780]  I talked about it a lot like I was doing a breeding project with
[01:10:34.620 --> 01:10:37.980]  Sunny not sunny chiba, but with Ray from homegrown natural wonders
[01:10:38.740 --> 01:10:45.060]  Who used to work for TGA and it's like I love having a second opinion on stuff someone else. That's good because I
[01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:51.900]  I have a tendency of really looking for that one. And sometimes I need other people to go. Okay. Well, these ones are good, too
[01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:52.860]  and
[01:10:52.860 --> 01:10:58.500]  You know debate about what's good about those varieties, you know when they're on the plants and then when we're smoking them
[01:10:58.500 --> 01:11:00.500]  I'm really really big on
[01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:06.180]  Smoking my winners to the selections that I make because sometimes on the plant it's great and then you also got to grow them out
[01:11:06.180 --> 01:11:07.140]  again
[01:11:07.140 --> 01:11:09.380]  So there's just so many little steps, you know
[01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:11.180]  Yeah, yeah
[01:11:11.180 --> 01:11:13.220]  and then you know if you have friends that make hash
[01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:18.800]  you want to see if it's one of those type of plants too because not every plant is you know,
[01:11:19.620 --> 01:11:22.740]  They're stuck on the desert island with you. Yeah
[01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:25.580]  Yeah, yeah
[01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:30.420]  Someone had a strawberry cough comment
[01:11:32.900 --> 01:11:35.340]  It is reminiscent of blue dream in a weird way
[01:11:36.900 --> 01:11:38.900]  Yeah, it's kind of a senior
[01:11:39.580 --> 01:11:41.580]  from JJ Wow
[01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:44.500]  Yeah, the incense after smoking is a total thing
[01:11:45.420 --> 01:11:52.140]  You know, it just leaves behind that smell in the room. That's very unique and I haven't found with any any other cannabis strain
[01:11:52.140 --> 01:11:54.980]  You know where you walk back and it's like, you know
[01:11:55.380 --> 01:12:00.680]  Smells like like incense like frankincense or myrrh, you know from in an old church
[01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:10.300]  Yeah, and then and then this is about the Jaffa to oh it's for James it is it's a amnesia haze times
[01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:13.020]  super lemon haze and those two varieties are sisters and
[01:12:13.700 --> 01:12:17.180]  So it's a it's a great Caribbean strain with open bud structure. I
[01:12:18.180 --> 01:12:24.420]  I heard someone, you know, I was reading through some of the chat messages on the last one and people were like
[01:12:24.980 --> 01:12:28.380]  joking about how open bud structure is something to achieve and
[01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:31.620]  It's definitely you know, if we're talking about geo geo
[01:12:32.020 --> 01:12:36.660]  Climatized strains and if you're growing for region those things are important, you know
[01:12:36.660 --> 01:12:41.840]  Every region is different and I think so many people focus on indoor and it's like it's not all about indoor
[01:12:42.380 --> 01:12:45.460]  You know and in the near future it's gonna be all about mixed light
[01:12:45.460 --> 01:12:52.780]  I feel like with the with the expensive electricity, you know, and we have this beautiful thing called the Sun, you know
[01:12:52.780 --> 01:12:53.980]  We're all gonna go in that direction
[01:12:53.980 --> 01:12:54.740]  You know
[01:12:54.740 --> 01:12:58.420]  And I feel like if you can do something both where you have that mixed light you have those
[01:12:58.700 --> 01:13:03.900]  High intensity or LEDs in combination with the Sun you're gonna get a better product
[01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:11.540]  Yeah, I tell people this all the time is that the future is is the kind of the modified greenhouse where you've got sunshine when?
[01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:13.700]  You've got light deprivation
[01:13:13.740 --> 01:13:20.420]  When you need it, you've got light supplementation when you need it and if you can climate control inside something like that
[01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:23.100]  you could pretty much grow anywhere and
[01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:26.780]  Much cheaper than having it be all indoor
[01:13:27.260 --> 01:13:29.500]  which I kind of see as kind of a
[01:13:30.260 --> 01:13:31.420]  weird
[01:13:31.420 --> 01:13:36.220]  Thing at this point, you know what? I mean? Like hence, Santa Barbara and Salinas
[01:13:37.220 --> 01:13:39.220]  Right
[01:13:39.420 --> 01:13:46.660]  Big huge greenhouses that you know to me I think that's kind of gonna be the future in particular, you know for
[01:13:47.180 --> 01:13:50.700]  Production of all these other things not necessarily top-shelf
[01:13:51.380 --> 01:13:56.980]  flour for the marketplace, but that's becoming a smaller and smaller part of the market and
[01:13:57.540 --> 01:14:01.740]  It's really, you know, you're gonna need all of this biomass to produce
[01:14:01.780 --> 01:14:08.700]  Edibles and tinctures and topicals and all these other products and and there's no way that you can
[01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:12.500]  Do that profitably by growing that product indoors
[01:14:14.540 --> 01:14:16.540]  In the future, you know, I mean
[01:14:16.860 --> 01:14:22.580]  Price per gram is obviously gonna drop to keep dropping and dropping and dropping and the production of that
[01:14:23.220 --> 01:14:29.420]  Can only really be lessened by you know, modifying going outdoors, you know or going into a greenhouse
[01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:31.540]  Right
[01:14:31.540 --> 01:14:34.900]  What strain seed has produced the densest bud coal is for you?
[01:14:35.540 --> 01:14:41.740]  I you know, it's this it's it's anything the Afghanica leaning the you're talking about the
[01:14:42.460 --> 01:14:48.820]  OG kush's stuff that you know is really dense Girl Scout cookies is another one. That's super dense for me
[01:14:48.820 --> 01:14:53.180]  It was like in the old days like white widow and and white rhino and
[01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:56.660]  Sensi star like those strains from like the late 90s
[01:14:56.660 --> 01:15:02.500]  They were all very dense. Did you were a rock bud from Soma? Oh, yeah, it's called stoma a plus
[01:15:03.020 --> 01:15:06.820]  Yeah, I one but one bud this big would be like an eighth, right?
[01:15:07.540 --> 01:15:11.860]  Yeah, and then the Canadians we used to get bud from Canadians like the Canada
[01:15:11.860 --> 01:15:16.500]  But they would vacuum seal into like a pound would be a football and that you know
[01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:20.060]  Hey, you'd like it would look at a tenth of a gram would be what it looked like
[01:15:20.060 --> 01:15:22.660]  But it was really a gram you put on a scale and people would be like, huh?
[01:15:22.660 --> 01:15:27.300]  Right, right break up one like tiny nugget and you get like three joints out of it. Yes
[01:15:28.420 --> 01:15:33.060]  But it smokes for like two hours. Oh, yeah, right super dense
[01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:38.260]  But you know, like we mentioned densities is less important these days. It seems
[01:15:39.020 --> 01:15:44.460]  you know, it's like you want surface area if you're gonna be stripping essential oil off and
[01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:50.100]  Even if you want it to burn properly and also, you know, you know, you can you can you can you can
[01:15:50.260 --> 01:15:52.780]  Even if you want it to burn properly and also, you know
[01:15:52.780 --> 01:15:58.420]  A lot of people live in places with powdery mildew and and all of these, you know airborne
[01:15:59.420 --> 01:16:01.260]  pathogens and things and
[01:16:01.260 --> 01:16:04.340]  the denser the bud the more likely something's gonna
[01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:09.940]  Rot, you know or get started in there and if they're airier and looser
[01:16:10.420 --> 01:16:14.900]  It's less likely that they're gonna get infected. So it really has to do with
[01:16:15.580 --> 01:16:18.020]  Climate and where you grow as well, right?
[01:16:20.260 --> 01:16:23.140]  So, what were you just smoking what was the device
[01:16:25.860 --> 01:16:27.860]  Yeah, it's a it's called a turpentine
[01:16:28.460 --> 01:16:31.420]  It's made by boundless technology. You just pull on it
[01:16:31.780 --> 01:16:35.340]  This is like, you know, just my indoor when I don't have my rig
[01:16:36.140 --> 01:16:38.640]  or a joint rolled or something like that and I have
[01:16:39.660 --> 01:16:41.960]  You know actually got some og
[01:16:43.660 --> 01:16:47.820]  OG Steve you guys will probably recognize that yeah
[01:16:48.420 --> 01:16:50.420]  And
[01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:53.380]  Yeah, just you just just pull on it and
[01:16:54.860 --> 01:16:59.660]  Works with solventless or you know solvent dabs and you get a nice
[01:17:00.860 --> 01:17:04.600]  It's somewhere between a vape pen and a dab rig, you know
[01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:09.280]  Like I put it like this like vape pen is at the lowest kind of level
[01:17:09.940 --> 01:17:15.020]  Then you got your you know, this kind of thing where it's like a sipping straw
[01:17:16.020 --> 01:17:20.500]  Apparatus I like this one because you don't have to press a button. It's also very cheap and
[01:17:21.380 --> 01:17:24.580]  Easy to you know replace or whatever. Then you've got your
[01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:30.820]  you know your peaks and your you know, your electric units, you know that kind of
[01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:33.500]  the new breed of
[01:17:33.620 --> 01:17:36.660]  Units and then you've got your like proper dab rig
[01:17:37.340 --> 01:17:40.300]  where you bust out the torch and get it all hot and I
[01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:46.740]  Kind of it's kind of like a that's the hierarchy for me and then you know, this is like ease of use indoor
[01:17:47.980 --> 01:17:49.980]  simple
[01:17:50.340 --> 01:17:53.340]  You know particularly for when you're doing podcasting
[01:17:56.860 --> 01:17:59.940]  So people on the dense bud
[01:18:01.180 --> 01:18:04.300]  Conversation obviously in some places you don't want those
[01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:07.060]  dense nuggets
[01:18:07.620 --> 01:18:09.620]  Yeah, I mean it's it's like a breeding
[01:18:11.180 --> 01:18:13.460]  Place for a lot of bad things there
[01:18:14.020 --> 01:18:20.300]  and you know, we mentioned earlier how that was like a big deal the bag appeal and density back in the day, but
[01:18:20.860 --> 01:18:26.640]  These days it's just it's not as important and I think you know, it's interesting that breeders, you know are now
[01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:31.940]  Changing what's a desirable trait, you know what what they're breeding for
[01:18:33.580 --> 01:18:35.580]  90% of her just breeding for gelato
[01:18:36.300 --> 01:18:38.300]  All right runs
[01:18:39.540 --> 01:18:44.260]  It's like we have so in here in California is kind of where everything kind of takes off from but man
[01:18:44.260 --> 01:18:50.180]  it's like every new variety that you know, especially these brands are kind of pushing for is
[01:18:51.020 --> 01:18:57.180]  All gelato Finos. They're they're like a slight variation of gelato that leans towards gelato
[01:18:57.180 --> 01:19:00.860]  You know, it's something a little bit different but you know, and there are some really good ones, you know
[01:19:00.860 --> 01:19:03.860]  You got to get about your frisky for that man. It's like who knew
[01:19:04.700 --> 01:19:08.860]  Gelato was gonna be the next Girl Scout cookies. Maybe even bigger than Girl Scout cookies
[01:19:09.820 --> 01:19:13.500]  Yeah, you know and then in a year it'll be something different, you know
[01:19:14.140 --> 01:19:19.300]  Or at least you know two or three years probably, you know, it might still have you know
[01:19:19.500 --> 01:19:23.260]  It really is a marketplace driven thing. You know, it's like what people
[01:19:24.100 --> 01:19:26.100]  want is what they're gonna get and
[01:19:26.540 --> 01:19:29.980]  You know so much so that people will rename things, you know
[01:19:30.380 --> 01:19:33.220]  Like I grew a bunch of this stuff and nobody wants it anymore
[01:19:33.220 --> 01:19:37.220]  So I'm just gonna call it this and hope hope they want it still wedding cake
[01:19:38.460 --> 01:19:42.380]  Wedding cake. Yeah, just call it wedding cake and send it out there and you know
[01:19:42.940 --> 01:19:44.260]  I
[01:19:44.260 --> 01:19:46.600]  Think you know part of our industry
[01:19:47.140 --> 01:19:54.420]  Coming out of the underground is going to be you know, a lot more clarification when it comes to genetic material
[01:19:54.940 --> 01:19:58.460]  What we're working with, you know, it takes
[01:19:59.460 --> 01:20:02.700]  You know labs with integrity to keep that information
[01:20:04.420 --> 01:20:06.420]  Solid, you know
[01:20:07.260 --> 01:20:09.260]  Total and a last important question
[01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:15.680]  What temperature do you like or 90?
[01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:20.640]  Yeah, 490 is good any anywhere between you know, I
[01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:28.360]  Don't know 440 and 480 is kind of like where I go, but it all depends honestly like it's kind of a feel thing
[01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:30.360]  I just have a way I know
[01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:32.920]  you know where I heat up until and
[01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:35.560]  you know, let it go until and
[01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:39.040]  Once in a while, I'll be a little hotter once in a while a little cooler
[01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:41.920]  but
[01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:48.480]  Yeah, I just you know, I like a lower temp dabs typically just because I know I'm gonna get high one way or the other
[01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:52.280]  but you know at that point the flavor is important and
[01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:57.800]  You know, I'll take a higher one on occasion as well. I don't know. I'm not too picky when it comes to that
[01:20:57.800 --> 01:20:59.080]  it's a
[01:20:59.080 --> 01:21:01.080]  More of a flower guy to begin with
[01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:08.080]  Anyway, so yeah, I don't get too scientific but that rosin I like if it's live resin rosin
[01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:10.480]  I like you going super low. Yeah
[01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:12.320]  chirps
[01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:14.320]  mm-hmm. All right, so
[01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:20.400]  why don't we wrap on that today's show is it's short and sweet and
[01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:23.400]  leaving people wanting more but
[01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:30.480]  So just quickly someone asked a while ago went when the Black Friday stuff's gonna ship so
[01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:34.320]  We will have it shipped sometime this week. I hope yeah
[01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:40.960]  Like I basically James is shipping a whole lot of seeds to me and then I get to pack each
[01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:45.720]  each shipment up with tender loving care and send them out and I
[01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:50.080]  will do that as fine and I'm gonna deputize my six-year-old because
[01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:55.680]  Repetitive tasks or we'll see how she fares and I'm joking but uh
[01:21:56.160 --> 01:22:02.000]  Tiny I gotta do that by myself. So that's gonna be a fun day long activity for me
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000]  and
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:09.480]  For for I had posted this earlier, but just if people have questions
[01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:13.680]  Send them there so that I can kind of I mean I get
[01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:17.600]  Questions from all different places and if it's a breeding question
[01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:22.640]  it would pop up on this show if it's something totally different maybe on something else but or
[01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:29.720]  Ideas of people you want to see on shows or topics you want covered. I saw some of those comments of topics
[01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:33.200]  but anyway with that everybody have a
[01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:37.800]  very happy Sunday and oh and Tuesday night we're doing the
[01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:40.320]  the
[01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:43.080]  the fire relief fundraisers again, so
[01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:48.400]  Will be we raised fifteen thousand last week eight thousand the week before
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:54.120]  I thought this week we could take the week off and then go hard for the rest of the year
[01:22:54.920 --> 01:23:02.660]  And then Wednesday morning people have been asking about Kevin Jojari. He's on Wednesday morning with a couple other NorCal
[01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:04.880]  farmers
[01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:06.360]  And
[01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:08.360]  then Thursday we got
[01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:13.400]  Layton and Brian and we're gonna be talking about a Duke diamond update
[01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:18.320]  Whoa
[01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:22.160]  I can hear myself in my head, but Danny we thank you
[01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:25.200]  Stay warm in New York
[01:23:26.160 --> 01:23:30.160]  I'm gonna go hang out in the Sun in my t-shirt in LA
[01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:32.520]  Thank you for having me
[01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:37.600]  hope everyone can check out Northeast leaf magazine and the grow by yourself podcast and
[01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:43.000]  Yeah, keep up the great work you guys thanks for having me
[01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:50.200]  Yeah, thanks for coming on man. Appreciate it. You guys have a great weekend, and we'll see you soon. Oh my god
[01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:53.240]  Look at that James Louds in the chat. We'll end it with that
[01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:56.280]  All right. See ya Cheers
