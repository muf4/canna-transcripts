[00:00.120 --> 00:02.920]  We are live. Take it away, Floyd.
[00:02.920 --> 00:05.380]  So what inspired this conversation?
[00:05.380 --> 00:07.320]  Why don't you start there?
[00:07.320 --> 00:10.400]  So really it's just, you know,
[00:10.400 --> 00:11.680]  I've always wanted to kind of like,
[00:11.680 --> 00:12.780]  I think I've talked to you, Peter,
[00:12.780 --> 00:15.280]  about trying to get out here and have more discussions,
[00:15.280 --> 00:19.300]  open discussions related to just cannabis breeding
[00:19.300 --> 00:22.920]  and, you know, the hemp industry and kind of just,
[00:22.920 --> 00:24.680]  for the most part, I've kind of sat in the back
[00:24.680 --> 00:26.480]  and I see a lot of information, you know,
[00:26.480 --> 00:27.680]  getting out there online.
[00:27.920 --> 00:30.200]  And generally I don't interact,
[00:30.200 --> 00:32.440]  but Colin's always posting, you know,
[00:32.440 --> 00:35.240]  good information and kind of provocative information.
[00:35.240 --> 00:39.640]  And he had a post the other day with the question,
[00:39.640 --> 00:41.240]  you know, is breeding too easy
[00:41.240 --> 00:42.640]  or is cannabis breeding too easy?
[00:42.640 --> 00:46.700]  And I was like, wow, you know, like it actually engaged me.
[00:46.700 --> 00:49.400]  And, you know, we kind of went back and forth
[00:49.400 --> 00:50.800]  and I was like, well,
[00:50.800 --> 00:54.640]  Peter's kind of offered this platform, you know, to us.
[00:54.640 --> 00:55.480]  Why don't we just, you know,
[00:55.480 --> 00:57.240]  and it's really hard to have a open discussion
[00:57.760 --> 00:59.240]  online like in text.
[00:59.240 --> 01:01.440]  And so I figured why not bring it
[01:01.440 --> 01:03.240]  to the Future Cannabis Project
[01:03.240 --> 01:06.840]  so others could kind of hear us, you know, discuss.
[01:06.840 --> 01:11.080]  And I think it's one of those questions where, you know,
[01:11.080 --> 01:12.680]  you could ask a hundred different people,
[01:12.680 --> 01:13.680]  a hundred different breeders,
[01:13.680 --> 01:16.120]  and you'd get about, you know, a hundred different answers.
[01:16.120 --> 01:20.600]  And so I think with Colin's kind of technical background
[01:20.600 --> 01:23.760]  and, you know, I think he can kind of go into his,
[01:23.760 --> 01:25.760]  you know, knowledge and expertise,
[01:26.480 --> 01:28.000]  but yeah, essentially that's what it was.
[01:28.000 --> 01:29.680]  It was a post that he had kind of made
[01:29.680 --> 01:33.240]  and it kind of spurred some interest in me.
[01:33.240 --> 01:34.560]  And then it just happened that, you know,
[01:34.560 --> 01:39.560]  we had reconnected and you had offered, you know,
[01:40.520 --> 01:42.680]  to do podcasts kind of whenever, you know,
[01:42.680 --> 01:43.800]  I had the opportunity
[01:43.800 --> 01:45.980]  or whenever I could kind of rope people in.
[01:45.980 --> 01:47.440]  And so I jumped on it.
[01:47.440 --> 01:48.720]  Is this the post?
[01:48.720 --> 01:50.120]  Is breeding too easy?
[01:50.120 --> 01:51.520]  Yeah, that's the one.
[01:51.520 --> 01:52.360]  Yeah.
[01:52.360 --> 01:55.120]  So Colin, explain yourself.
[01:55.960 --> 01:58.760]  Yeah, it's a very explanatory comment.
[01:58.760 --> 02:01.640]  A lot of, and I guess that question is double-sided
[02:01.640 --> 02:03.120]  because they're both, I think I could agree with,
[02:03.120 --> 02:05.680]  yes, it is, and then the flip side.
[02:05.680 --> 02:09.000]  But yeah, like Floyd said, I tend to do a lot of things.
[02:09.000 --> 02:12.000]  I think campus culture has this knowledge base
[02:12.000 --> 02:17.000]  and I try to bring some practicality to a lot of what I do
[02:17.080 --> 02:18.920]  and what I talk about in my greenhouse,
[02:18.920 --> 02:20.200]  what I kind of apply.
[02:20.200 --> 02:22.920]  And so, and a lot of things I do,
[02:22.920 --> 02:24.200]  and whether it's the bro science
[02:24.200 --> 02:26.880]  or I chase certain topics and I say, you know,
[02:26.880 --> 02:28.080]  how well does that actually work?
[02:28.080 --> 02:30.160]  Whether it's common knowledge in the industry
[02:30.160 --> 02:32.640]  and just try and put some technical terms
[02:32.640 --> 02:33.480]  to a lot of the stuff.
[02:33.480 --> 02:37.360]  And I've known Floyd for, you know, a few years,
[02:37.360 --> 02:40.360]  at least now through, you know, running his genetics.
[02:40.360 --> 02:41.520]  And then I think we've seen each other
[02:41.520 --> 02:42.720]  at some shows here and there.
[02:42.720 --> 02:44.560]  And so it's a good conversation
[02:44.560 --> 02:46.440]  and it's a good place to talk about the stuff
[02:46.440 --> 02:47.280]  a little bit more.
[02:47.280 --> 02:49.320]  And so I'm always open for that opportunity.
[02:50.800 --> 02:51.640]  Yeah.
[02:51.640 --> 02:53.040]  Yeah, so I was just trying to make sure everyone
[02:53.040 --> 02:57.160]  could read the whole thing, but go for it.
[02:57.160 --> 03:02.160]  Yeah, I recommend checking out Colin's Instagram page
[03:02.360 --> 03:03.880]  because it's loaded with information.
[03:03.880 --> 03:07.600]  I think you can, anybody can gain a lot of, you know,
[03:07.600 --> 03:10.080]  knowledge from what he's got going on.
[03:11.320 --> 03:13.600]  But yeah, I mean, I think this is, you know,
[03:13.600 --> 03:15.160]  I just wanted this to be kind of open-ended.
[03:15.160 --> 03:17.240]  I mean, we could take it anywhere really.
[03:17.240 --> 03:19.240]  I mean, you can, you know, kind of peel back the onion
[03:19.240 --> 03:22.560]  and approach that topic from a bunch of different ways.
[03:23.080 --> 03:25.480]  But first off, I definitely wanted to kind of go into,
[03:25.480 --> 03:28.120]  you know, Colin's background and have him just kind of share
[03:28.120 --> 03:31.560]  like his expertise, what, you know, where he's coming from.
[03:31.560 --> 03:34.040]  I know he's, they do, you know, greenhouse systems.
[03:34.040 --> 03:37.720]  He's got background in, you know, hop, hop,
[03:37.720 --> 03:39.720]  and maybe, you know, some of your breeding experience,
[03:39.720 --> 03:44.720]  whether it's in cannabis or other, you know, crops.
[03:44.800 --> 03:46.360]  And then say, you know, vice versa,
[03:46.360 --> 03:48.480]  I can kind of just do a little background on me
[03:48.480 --> 03:50.960]  so people have context to where we're coming from.
[03:51.960 --> 03:53.280]  So yeah, for sure.
[03:53.280 --> 03:54.720]  You wanna take it away?
[03:54.720 --> 03:57.120]  Yeah, so yeah, I guess I'll give a little background
[03:57.120 --> 03:59.280]  on myself and then I'll kind of explain the context
[03:59.280 --> 04:00.980]  of that post.
[04:00.980 --> 04:04.960]  Some of those are kind of clickbait ideas or titles
[04:04.960 --> 04:05.920]  with some thought behind them.
[04:05.920 --> 04:08.960]  So I've been doing controlled environment ag culture
[04:08.960 --> 04:11.680]  for, oh, I don't know, a few decades now.
[04:12.840 --> 04:16.600]  Cannabis grower kind of originally always, you know,
[04:16.600 --> 04:19.480]  from the 90s, I guess you can say going forward.
[04:19.720 --> 04:21.080]  Then I took a phase where I really wanted
[04:21.080 --> 04:22.360]  to get the educational side of it.
[04:22.360 --> 04:24.200]  So I went to school, got my degree
[04:24.200 --> 04:27.400]  from University of Arizona and then moved to Colorado,
[04:27.400 --> 04:30.800]  did a lot of plant research at Colorado State University
[04:30.800 --> 04:34.360]  with tomatoes and hops and then hemp as well.
[04:34.360 --> 04:37.960]  And then went to work with mammoth pea or gross encha
[04:37.960 --> 04:38.800]  for quite a while.
[04:38.800 --> 04:41.200]  And we formulated a lot of the trials and stuff
[04:41.200 --> 04:43.000]  for mammoth pea in my greenhouse here.
[04:43.000 --> 04:43.960]  And so on the farm here,
[04:43.960 --> 04:46.000]  I've got 5,000 square foot greenhouse.
[04:46.000 --> 04:49.440]  And then we've got about 65 acres of soil production
[04:50.280 --> 04:51.560]  that we usually run for trials.
[04:51.560 --> 04:54.080]  But yeah, originally I came back to Colorado for hops.
[04:54.080 --> 04:57.880]  We did one of the first hydroponic hop greenhouses
[04:57.880 --> 05:00.040]  and ran that for a while.
[05:00.040 --> 05:02.440]  And then the hop market, you know, it wasn't as strong.
[05:02.440 --> 05:03.360]  It was kind of like, I guess,
[05:03.360 --> 05:04.840]  the hemp market the last few years.
[05:04.840 --> 05:06.160]  It was this big boom for a while,
[05:06.160 --> 05:08.440]  and then it kind of settled.
[05:08.440 --> 05:11.080]  And then I worked through or with Crop King
[05:11.080 --> 05:14.160]  and through Crop King, you know, I do a lot of consultation
[05:14.160 --> 05:15.560]  but a lot of research-based trials
[05:15.560 --> 05:17.080]  and things that we've been doing here.
[05:17.080 --> 05:20.640]  And through Crop King, we sell greenhouses, supplies.
[05:20.640 --> 05:21.600]  We have engineers on house.
[05:21.600 --> 05:23.760]  So it's kind of a broad spectrum, you know,
[05:23.760 --> 05:25.560]  everything from we can build you a greenhouse
[05:25.560 --> 05:28.060]  to supply nutrients and things like that.
[05:28.960 --> 05:31.160]  Yeah, it's just quickly there.
[05:31.160 --> 05:32.040]  It's actually funny.
[05:32.040 --> 05:33.800]  Cause when Floyd was first like,
[05:33.800 --> 05:35.560]  this guy Colin from Crop King,
[05:35.560 --> 05:37.440]  I was like Crap King, the seed company?
[05:37.440 --> 05:40.600]  And he's like, no, no, different Crop King.
[05:40.600 --> 05:43.320]  Yeah, no, I remember getting, going to some trade shows.
[05:43.320 --> 05:44.960]  I think, I don't know what it was.
[05:45.800 --> 05:48.960]  I forget, one of the Canicons, I think it was Oklahoma.
[05:48.960 --> 05:52.160]  And there was this big hype of, or, you know,
[05:52.160 --> 05:54.880]  some of the shady things Crop King seeds have done.
[05:54.880 --> 05:57.200]  And then everyone's like, oh, Colin, he's here.
[05:57.200 --> 05:59.360]  And so people come up to me and I'm like, whoa, whoa,
[05:59.360 --> 06:03.000]  distinction, there's a separation, not the same company.
[06:03.000 --> 06:06.080]  So, and we've gotten into like trying to battle the name
[06:06.080 --> 06:07.280]  but they're a Canadian company.
[06:07.280 --> 06:08.600]  So it's just like, yeah,
[06:08.600 --> 06:11.100]  we're far enough away that most people,
[06:11.100 --> 06:12.280]  but yeah, no, I do get that a lot.
[06:12.280 --> 06:14.880]  So no affiliation to Crop King seeds by any means.
[06:16.480 --> 06:19.600]  I thought that was important to clarify for everyone.
[06:19.600 --> 06:21.040]  Yeah, no, I appreciate that.
[06:21.040 --> 06:23.200]  I get a lot of instant turnoffs from that.
[06:23.200 --> 06:25.320]  I think I had the same idea when I first came,
[06:25.320 --> 06:28.280]  you know, Cropstead, your name a couple of years back.
[06:28.280 --> 06:30.080]  So yeah, but with a little bit of digging,
[06:30.080 --> 06:32.440]  you kind of know there's some separation.
[06:32.440 --> 06:33.920]  Yeah, and I think haven't they changed
[06:33.920 --> 06:36.040]  to like Rocket Seeds now, or are they still,
[06:36.040 --> 06:37.580]  I think they kind of changed their seeder names
[06:37.580 --> 06:38.720]  every couple of years,
[06:38.720 --> 06:41.840]  but I know they've been advertising as Rocket Seeds.
[06:42.400 --> 06:43.760]  They probably sell under a bunch of different names.
[06:43.760 --> 06:44.780]  Yeah.
[06:44.780 --> 06:45.640]  True.
[06:45.640 --> 06:49.880]  So I guess the basis behind that post the other day is,
[06:49.880 --> 06:52.700]  and you know, and I have experience in other crops
[06:52.700 --> 06:55.760]  like hops and tomatoes, more traditional agriculture.
[06:55.760 --> 07:00.240]  And so understanding the breeding that goes on in that
[07:00.240 --> 07:01.880]  versus kind of the cannabis scene.
[07:01.880 --> 07:05.080]  And so with commercial agriculture,
[07:05.080 --> 07:07.760]  with tomatoes, hops, any of that kind of stuff,
[07:07.760 --> 07:11.000]  breeding is a very long process.
[07:11.280 --> 07:13.440]  It's seven, eight, nine years
[07:13.440 --> 07:15.320]  to get these new cultivars out.
[07:15.320 --> 07:19.240]  And so it takes a lot of labor to get to that point.
[07:19.240 --> 07:21.480]  And so then with cannabis, it's more of,
[07:21.480 --> 07:24.580]  a lot of these polyhybrid just crosses.
[07:24.580 --> 07:27.120]  And so you see the flood of these crosses.
[07:27.120 --> 07:30.800]  And so that aspect of breeding is kind of what I coined,
[07:30.800 --> 07:31.700]  is that too easy?
[07:31.700 --> 07:34.440]  Because a lot of people can do that,
[07:34.440 --> 07:36.920]  create these new cultivars.
[07:36.920 --> 07:39.080]  And so my challenge in that post was,
[07:39.080 --> 07:40.640]  is that true breeding?
[07:41.280 --> 07:44.240]  And I think if you're looking from a botanical sense,
[07:44.240 --> 07:47.120]  that doesn't fall into that line of true breeding,
[07:47.120 --> 07:50.800]  or if you talk about peer breeding or peer lines,
[07:50.800 --> 07:53.600]  it's definitely not that.
[07:53.600 --> 07:54.860]  But I'm also in the same hand,
[07:54.860 --> 07:57.000]  I'm not trying to knock that
[07:57.000 --> 07:59.060]  that's kind of where cannabis has come.
[07:59.060 --> 08:01.360]  It's created some really cool hybrids
[08:01.360 --> 08:05.280]  and some really cool varieties that we see out there,
[08:05.280 --> 08:07.320]  but it lacks the stability.
[08:07.320 --> 08:12.040]  And I think as it goes from underground to more commercial,
[08:12.040 --> 08:15.780]  where you're gonna need to rely on larger genetics
[08:15.780 --> 08:16.900]  and these inbred lines,
[08:16.900 --> 08:19.040]  I think it's gonna become more important.
[08:19.040 --> 08:20.400]  But in the past it's worked well,
[08:20.400 --> 08:22.080]  you could buy a handful of seeds
[08:22.080 --> 08:23.600]  and you get some really cool stuff,
[08:23.600 --> 08:25.840]  you can get some interesting stuff and it doesn't matter.
[08:25.840 --> 08:28.880]  But now legalization, we're starting to see a need for that.
[08:32.080 --> 08:33.480]  For you, would something,
[08:33.480 --> 08:38.080]  I mean, I think of kind of uniformity.
[08:38.080 --> 08:41.320]  So like if someone popped hundreds of your seeds,
[08:41.320 --> 08:42.920]  and I'm thinking from like,
[08:42.920 --> 08:47.920]  if I'm selling seeds to a commercial operator in California
[08:48.240 --> 08:50.320]  or Colorado or wherever,
[08:50.320 --> 08:53.200]  and then kind of the intent behind that project,
[08:53.200 --> 08:56.320]  which was, maybe it was great flavor
[08:56.320 --> 08:58.160]  and powdery mildew resistance,
[08:58.160 --> 09:02.000]  or whatever the, or like old school genetics
[09:02.000 --> 09:03.880]  with like short flowering,
[09:03.880 --> 09:05.820]  like commercial flowering time,
[09:07.000 --> 09:09.360]  finishing capabilities or something like that.
[09:09.360 --> 09:13.240]  Whereas the other is kind of like,
[09:13.240 --> 09:16.720]  I got a pack of something from some breeder
[09:16.720 --> 09:19.240]  and I quickly crossed it to something else
[09:19.240 --> 09:21.980]  and four months later, I'm now selling that.
[09:23.180 --> 09:24.800]  And if someone grows it out,
[09:24.800 --> 09:28.140]  they may get a lot of cool stuff,
[09:28.140 --> 09:29.720]  but it's more like about the fee,
[09:30.360 --> 09:32.040]  for that person who bought that pack,
[09:32.040 --> 09:34.280]  it'd be more about the pheno hunting and the fun
[09:34.280 --> 09:38.480]  rather than being able to rely on those 12 seeds
[09:38.480 --> 09:43.480]  or 200 seeds to give me something very consistent.
[09:43.580 --> 09:46.080]  And is that kind of-
[09:46.080 --> 09:47.920]  Yeah, I mean, I think you're spot on
[09:47.920 --> 09:50.640]  and that's kind of, I think where we are right now.
[09:50.640 --> 09:55.640]  And when it comes to getting these homogenous genetic lines
[09:57.000 --> 09:58.160]  and you're right.
[09:58.160 --> 10:00.200]  And so, and I guess here's a story back,
[10:00.200 --> 10:02.200]  I first started working with Thomas
[10:02.200 --> 10:04.080]  with high alpine genetics is a few,
[10:04.080 --> 10:06.040]  I don't know what three, four, five,
[10:06.040 --> 10:08.440]  how long years that we've been doing this.
[10:09.400 --> 10:11.880]  But I remember, I think I bought all of his runs.
[10:11.880 --> 10:13.760]  Cause again, I'm coming from,
[10:13.760 --> 10:15.520]  at least on the commercial side of it,
[10:15.520 --> 10:19.680]  hops and these large scale traditional agriculture methods.
[10:19.680 --> 10:21.200]  So I contacted Thomas and I'm like,
[10:21.200 --> 10:23.480]  I want 12 of your cultivars
[10:23.480 --> 10:25.000]  and I wanna fill my greenhouse.
[10:25.000 --> 10:26.960]  I'm gonna do this first year as a trial run,
[10:26.960 --> 10:28.680]  see which ones work well.
[10:28.680 --> 10:31.760]  And then I'm gonna go big on those next year.
[10:31.760 --> 10:32.580]  And so I did that.
[10:32.580 --> 10:34.960]  I ran 12 and that's back, I think it was like
[10:34.960 --> 10:39.960]  Turptown, Abracadabra, it was his hot sauce kind of line.
[10:40.400 --> 10:42.000]  And so I ran a greenhouse full of them.
[10:42.000 --> 10:43.560]  I picked the ones I want.
[10:43.560 --> 10:46.720]  And I think it was Abracadabra and Turptown I really liked.
[10:46.720 --> 10:50.040]  So I chose those, a few phenotypes, just really good flower.
[10:50.040 --> 10:50.880]  So I was excited.
[10:50.880 --> 10:52.600]  And then I went back to Thomas, I was like, all right, man,
[10:52.600 --> 10:54.720]  I want 2000 seeds of these.
[10:54.720 --> 10:56.080]  I want 3000 seeds of those.
[10:56.080 --> 10:59.040]  And he's like, oh, we don't, I'm not doing those anymore.
[10:59.040 --> 11:00.280]  And he was onto the next thing.
[11:00.280 --> 11:03.480]  And that's kind of when I realized, okay, all right.
[11:03.480 --> 11:06.440]  So it's more of this creating these strains
[11:06.440 --> 11:09.880]  and then you gotta kind of do the groundwork to create that.
[11:09.880 --> 11:10.880]  And so that's where my,
[11:10.880 --> 11:14.040]  I kind of shifted in what I was looking for in genetics.
[11:14.040 --> 11:16.360]  And again, you have the growers have to do a lot
[11:16.360 --> 11:19.040]  of the groundwork in some of these genetics
[11:19.040 --> 11:22.680]  where it's like you can create this cool F1.
[11:22.680 --> 11:25.320]  And I guess we could hop into terminology
[11:25.320 --> 11:27.840]  and you get with F1, you get this,
[11:27.840 --> 11:30.600]  what are the heterosis or the hybrid vigor?
[11:30.600 --> 11:34.520]  But that is only if you're coming from pure lines
[11:34.520 --> 11:39.520]  and most breeders, and obviously I'll let Floyd talk more
[11:39.760 --> 11:41.960]  about this as he's more involved in that side of it.
[11:41.960 --> 11:44.160]  But most breeders aren't breeding from pure lines.
[11:44.160 --> 11:45.680]  There's just really not that many out there.
[11:45.680 --> 11:49.360]  So a lot of these, you're not getting that F1 vigor
[11:49.360 --> 11:50.960]  that you should be getting.
[11:50.960 --> 11:52.960]  And you're just getting these crosses of crosses.
[11:52.960 --> 11:54.240]  And so it's hard to track
[11:54.240 --> 11:58.160]  and you can do dehybridization,
[11:58.160 --> 12:00.840]  which is harder in a dioecious plant.
[12:00.840 --> 12:02.920]  But you can do things that like single this out.
[12:02.920 --> 12:04.560]  But to circle back, yeah, it's like,
[12:04.560 --> 12:06.920]  and for me specifically, we deal with farms
[12:06.920 --> 12:07.960]  and I wanna grow from seed.
[12:07.960 --> 12:10.980]  I love seed, I love the structure, the morphology.
[12:10.980 --> 12:12.840]  I love going from seed, it's easier.
[12:13.680 --> 12:14.880]  But if I have a farm that says, hey,
[12:14.880 --> 12:19.760]  I wanna do this bay, 3000 plants from seed,
[12:19.760 --> 12:21.640]  I want them looking the same.
[12:21.640 --> 12:22.520]  It's like a Coca-Cola.
[12:22.520 --> 12:24.000]  If you buy a Coca-Cola,
[12:24.000 --> 12:25.520]  you want it to be the same everywhere you go.
[12:25.520 --> 12:29.040]  And you kind of want that in a genetic line.
[12:29.040 --> 12:32.440]  So when you do that, you plant these 2000 seeds,
[12:32.440 --> 12:35.680]  you could have half of them or this or that.
[12:35.680 --> 12:37.840]  And so it's really hard to nail it down,
[12:37.840 --> 12:40.120]  which is why people run clones.
[12:40.120 --> 12:42.400]  But yeah, I mean, I'll let Floyd jump in.
[12:42.400 --> 12:43.520]  I don't wanna chat this whole time,
[12:43.520 --> 12:46.200]  but there's a jumpstart.
[12:47.280 --> 12:48.840]  Yeah, I mean, I think you make a good distinction
[12:48.840 --> 12:51.200]  between like production lines of farmers
[12:51.200 --> 12:52.400]  that kind of want uniformity.
[12:53.280 --> 12:54.400]  And I think there's plenty of breeders out there
[12:54.400 --> 12:57.480]  that kind of are doing just that.
[12:57.480 --> 13:00.160]  I mean, probably the biggest one we can name
[13:00.160 --> 13:01.180]  is Oregon CBD, right?
[13:01.180 --> 13:03.720]  They came out of the gate with true F1s,
[13:03.720 --> 13:06.960]  like using inbred photo and auto lines
[13:06.960 --> 13:08.520]  and then creating early seasons.
[13:08.520 --> 13:11.080]  So they're kind of like the standard.
[13:11.080 --> 13:13.480]  But then we also have to look at prohibition.
[13:13.480 --> 13:17.120]  I mean, the cannabis industry, well, cannabis industry,
[13:17.120 --> 13:19.800]  I mean, if we're talking hemp industry right now,
[13:19.800 --> 13:22.720]  2018, the farm bill kind of passed.
[13:22.720 --> 13:27.040]  2019 was the first year that the country came online.
[13:27.040 --> 13:29.040]  And so, I mean, you're talking about
[13:29.040 --> 13:30.960]  a very small gene pool of genetics.
[13:30.960 --> 13:33.280]  So I mean, there's no way,
[13:33.280 --> 13:36.660]  I mean, potentially people had been breeding for years,
[13:36.660 --> 13:39.160]  maybe focusing on CBD.
[13:39.160 --> 13:41.020]  So you have to kind of take into account
[13:41.020 --> 13:42.820]  the beginning of an industry
[13:42.820 --> 13:46.120]  and the amount of time that it takes to create
[13:46.120 --> 13:48.020]  kind of stable lines, like you said.
[13:48.860 --> 13:52.020]  And then, so I think, even like with Thomas,
[13:52.020 --> 13:55.100]  I mean, a lot of times we're starting with these genetics
[13:55.100 --> 13:56.180]  that may not be the best.
[13:56.180 --> 13:57.260]  And within a couple of years,
[13:57.260 --> 13:59.860]  I mean, we've made leaps and bounds.
[13:59.860 --> 14:00.700]  That for sure.
[14:00.700 --> 14:04.420]  So I think there is a place for, like you said,
[14:04.420 --> 14:09.240]  these uniform production lines for big farms.
[14:09.240 --> 14:10.380]  And I think that will always be.
[14:10.380 --> 14:15.260]  And I think the hemp industry will stand as
[14:15.260 --> 14:17.940]  kind of a role model or a format
[14:17.940 --> 14:19.820]  for the future of the cannabis industry
[14:19.820 --> 14:22.340]  as it's legalized around the world
[14:22.340 --> 14:24.100]  and throughout our country.
[14:24.100 --> 14:28.660]  It's gonna look more like conventional ag on a bigger scale.
[14:30.060 --> 14:33.700]  But I think, so there's always gonna be a place for that,
[14:33.700 --> 14:36.500]  but that doesn't discount the fact that, like you said,
[14:37.500 --> 14:41.380]  the barrier to entry of as far as like making seed, right?
[14:41.380 --> 14:45.180]  I mean, anybody can kind of throw two plants together
[14:46.060 --> 14:48.020]  and create something new,
[14:48.020 --> 14:50.060]  but that doesn't necessarily mean
[14:50.060 --> 14:52.020]  that you're gonna break into the market
[14:53.060 --> 14:56.040]  as a commercial or a successful breeder.
[14:56.040 --> 14:58.460]  I think there's, as far as the barrier to entry
[14:58.460 --> 15:01.220]  into like doing it for a living,
[15:01.220 --> 15:04.860]  that next step requires years of work
[15:04.860 --> 15:08.980]  and kind of like validation through customer support.
[15:10.220 --> 15:13.480]  And so I think, and I think it's important as a breeder
[15:13.480 --> 15:16.920]  probably to have your inbred stable lines for production,
[15:16.920 --> 15:18.800]  but then never stop creating new lines
[15:18.800 --> 15:21.880]  because there is gonna be a demand for home growers
[15:21.880 --> 15:24.640]  or even commercial farms that,
[15:24.640 --> 15:26.600]  especially indoor cultivation,
[15:26.600 --> 15:30.760]  it's always kind of been toward clone, clone only.
[15:30.760 --> 15:35.760]  I mean, as far as like uniform, homogenous production.
[15:36.240 --> 15:38.780]  And I think they take that into account.
[15:40.000 --> 15:41.880]  And so, I mean, and then kind of pulling
[15:41.880 --> 15:44.320]  from the cannabis side, you have certain strains
[15:44.320 --> 15:47.140]  that have stuck around for years in clone form,
[15:47.140 --> 15:50.200]  which you could have breeders that have maybe an incentive
[15:50.200 --> 15:52.880]  to create like a true breeding line from it
[15:52.880 --> 15:55.880]  and try to replicate that clone.
[15:57.120 --> 16:00.800]  But even then, what is the incentive?
[16:00.800 --> 16:02.480]  I mean, are you gonna operate,
[16:02.480 --> 16:04.440]  are you gonna develop these lines
[16:04.440 --> 16:07.160]  without making a profit for six, seven years?
[16:07.160 --> 16:10.240]  So I mean, and I think, coming from a breeder,
[16:10.680 --> 16:12.480]  from kind of my perspective,
[16:13.640 --> 16:16.240]  seed production and breeding is my passion,
[16:16.240 --> 16:19.080]  but it's only a portion of our income.
[16:19.080 --> 16:21.640]  I could not survive just on seed sales alone.
[16:21.640 --> 16:23.720]  So I think there's something to be said for that too.
[16:23.720 --> 16:26.420]  So as we transition and grow as breeders
[16:26.420 --> 16:27.820]  and the industry grows,
[16:27.820 --> 16:31.440]  I think the goal will always be like Colin said,
[16:31.440 --> 16:33.760]  is like that is kind of the ideal, right?
[16:33.760 --> 16:37.800]  Is to create these production lines for farmers,
[16:37.800 --> 16:42.680]  but then also having kind of polyhybrids and diversity
[16:42.680 --> 16:44.640]  that you can then draw from,
[16:44.640 --> 16:47.840]  because that's kind of like your tool set, right?
[16:49.240 --> 16:50.560]  And as a breeder too,
[16:50.560 --> 16:53.400]  there's something to be said for variety,
[16:53.400 --> 16:55.080]  like it's the spice of life,
[16:55.080 --> 16:59.120]  but yeah, I mean, I think there's a lot of seed breeders
[16:59.120 --> 17:02.760]  out there and they all serve a role,
[17:02.760 --> 17:05.360]  but it's like, who's gonna be around in 10, 20 years,
[17:05.360 --> 17:07.680]  I think will be the ultimate test, right?
[17:08.560 --> 17:09.360]  So in many ways the market decides
[17:09.360 --> 17:11.240]  who ends up being successful or not.
[17:12.360 --> 17:14.040]  Yeah, and I agree.
[17:14.040 --> 17:17.360]  And I think when you talk about incentivizing genetics,
[17:17.360 --> 17:18.200]  cause it's like you said,
[17:18.200 --> 17:22.440]  if you have nine years to do one cultivar
[17:22.440 --> 17:24.920]  and in culture right now, it doesn't like that.
[17:24.920 --> 17:28.140]  Like Oregon CBD doesn't have a great rap
[17:28.140 --> 17:29.760]  amongst the culture.
[17:29.760 --> 17:30.720]  Farmers like them.
[17:30.720 --> 17:32.760]  Like I tend to really enjoy them
[17:32.760 --> 17:36.360]  because I can plant 500 other seeds and they're spot on,
[17:36.480 --> 17:37.760]  but they're not popular.
[17:37.760 --> 17:39.680]  And the culture and the market season says,
[17:39.680 --> 17:42.040]  oh, super sour space candy, wow.
[17:42.040 --> 17:43.440]  Nobody's impressed with it,
[17:43.440 --> 17:47.000]  but as a farmer, that's kind of what we wanna grow.
[17:47.000 --> 17:48.480]  We wanna keep those moving.
[17:48.480 --> 17:50.700]  And so then when you say incentivize it,
[17:50.700 --> 17:52.520]  that's where you get into the,
[17:52.520 --> 17:55.580]  like with Monsanto trying to patent things.
[17:55.580 --> 17:56.640]  And it makes sense.
[17:56.640 --> 17:58.960]  If you're gonna spend eight years, nine years,
[17:58.960 --> 18:02.160]  putting all of this effort into having this one stock,
[18:02.160 --> 18:04.600]  you need some way of getting your money back.
[18:04.600 --> 18:06.520]  But then in canvas companies and breeders,
[18:06.520 --> 18:07.520]  some breeders are doing this now.
[18:07.520 --> 18:10.200]  They're trying to say, well, how can I monetize?
[18:10.200 --> 18:12.240]  How can I patent this variety?
[18:12.240 --> 18:13.400]  Which is kind of the backlash.
[18:13.400 --> 18:16.000]  Cause I think obviously Monsanto kind of has a bad rap
[18:16.000 --> 18:18.400]  for some things they do, rightfully so.
[18:18.400 --> 18:21.160]  But as far as patenting it,
[18:21.160 --> 18:23.560]  somehow they have to recoup their efforts in doing that.
[18:23.560 --> 18:26.640]  Otherwise just keep producing these poly crosses
[18:26.640 --> 18:27.960]  and send them out there.
[18:27.960 --> 18:30.940]  And so right now the incentive for breeders is
[18:30.940 --> 18:32.840]  keep producing what's popular.
[18:32.880 --> 18:34.520]  Mash the newest clones together,
[18:34.520 --> 18:37.160]  find something, the new flavor, push it out there.
[18:37.160 --> 18:39.440]  So that's the incentive for breeders to make a living
[18:39.440 --> 18:41.520]  and to be popular and gain popularity
[18:41.520 --> 18:45.080]  and get those cultivars in the hands of famous growers.
[18:45.080 --> 18:46.520]  And then that's kind of how you get
[18:46.520 --> 18:48.880]  these crazy seed lines out there.
[18:48.880 --> 18:51.600]  But it's, and again, this kind of touches on my post.
[18:51.600 --> 18:54.520]  It's not doing much for the integrity of breeding
[18:54.520 --> 18:57.680]  because all of these kind of polyhybrids out there
[18:57.680 --> 18:59.160]  aren't stable lines.
[18:59.160 --> 19:01.760]  They're just kind of further diverging from,
[19:02.760 --> 19:04.200]  and you probably know more than anybody,
[19:04.200 --> 19:07.640]  there's not too many stable indica's or stable sativa's
[19:07.640 --> 19:08.720]  that you can find anymore.
[19:08.720 --> 19:13.120]  And trying to find a true purebred line is hard to find.
[19:13.120 --> 19:14.600]  I mean, I think you can get,
[19:14.600 --> 19:17.520]  you know, like blueberry and there's some of the classic,
[19:17.520 --> 19:20.680]  you know, the skunks that you might be able to get hold of.
[19:20.680 --> 19:22.320]  Sure, there's some of those old varieties,
[19:22.320 --> 19:24.040]  but it's hard to find.
[19:24.040 --> 19:26.280]  And so without having those true stocks.
[19:26.280 --> 19:28.040]  And so my point, I guess, in the post is
[19:28.040 --> 19:32.020]  I don't want to say we don't need these, you know,
[19:32.020 --> 19:33.320]  small breeders, we just need big.
[19:33.320 --> 19:34.240]  We need both.
[19:34.240 --> 19:36.320]  But I think we need some more of these,
[19:36.320 --> 19:38.640]  the Oregon CBD type that can look through
[19:38.640 --> 19:41.920]  all of the awesome, you know, crosses that have been made,
[19:41.920 --> 19:44.600]  find some of those and then create some new IBLs.
[19:44.600 --> 19:47.440]  Because then from those, then you can have some true F1's.
[19:47.440 --> 19:49.200]  Then we get that true F1 bigger back.
[19:49.200 --> 19:51.260]  And I think Royal, I just read something
[19:51.260 --> 19:52.100]  a couple of weeks ago.
[19:52.100 --> 19:53.680]  I think Royal Queen Seeds,
[19:53.680 --> 19:57.240]  they're apparently coming out with their first true F1.
[19:57.240 --> 19:59.720]  It's from apparently two IBL lines
[19:59.720 --> 20:01.080]  that they've been working on.
[20:01.080 --> 20:02.480]  And I think, you know, they go back decades.
[20:02.480 --> 20:05.120]  So I think it's going in that direction.
[20:05.120 --> 20:07.800]  And I guess that's the conversation I was trying to spur
[20:07.800 --> 20:10.600]  is like, there's nothing wrong with everybody breeding,
[20:10.600 --> 20:12.820]  but there is a difference between, you know,
[20:12.820 --> 20:14.440]  making these kinds of poly crosses
[20:14.440 --> 20:17.760]  versus creating a 10 year IBL line.
[20:17.760 --> 20:20.160]  They're just different styles.
[20:20.160 --> 20:22.880]  And I think, you know, to speak on your IP protection,
[20:22.880 --> 20:24.880]  like I think that's an important aspect.
[20:25.160 --> 20:27.200]  And I don't think many breeders would want
[20:27.200 --> 20:30.240]  to release their IBL lines out to the public at this point,
[20:30.240 --> 20:32.160]  which is why they create these F1's,
[20:32.160 --> 20:34.560]  because, you know, it's gonna take anybody,
[20:34.560 --> 20:36.160]  several generations to, you know,
[20:36.160 --> 20:39.520]  to back engineer that cross essentially.
[20:39.520 --> 20:41.860]  So it's like, you know, especially with Oregon CBD,
[20:41.860 --> 20:43.920]  you take that to F2 and now you've got autos.
[20:43.920 --> 20:45.480]  And you can kind of, it's transparent
[20:45.480 --> 20:47.040]  when you grow some of these seeds out
[20:47.040 --> 20:49.440]  and there's autos popping up that chances are,
[20:49.440 --> 20:51.080]  they, you know, they just took a, you know,
[20:51.080 --> 20:54.080]  a photo by auto hybrid to the next generation.
[20:54.080 --> 20:57.360]  So, I mean, in that, in some ways
[20:57.360 --> 20:59.440]  that is built in IP protection, right?
[20:59.440 --> 21:00.640]  Because you're forcing,
[21:01.520 --> 21:03.760]  you're basically preventing that breeder from doing,
[21:03.760 --> 21:05.880]  you know, just second generation knockoffs.
[21:05.880 --> 21:08.360]  And I don't think many breeders would want
[21:08.360 --> 21:10.080]  to release an IBL.
[21:10.080 --> 21:12.560]  I mean, I think breeders do have their own IBL lines
[21:12.560 --> 21:15.320]  and they specifically use that to make, you know,
[21:15.320 --> 21:17.320]  their own hybrids and release the hybrids.
[21:17.320 --> 21:19.140]  So, I mean, you do see that within the industry
[21:19.140 --> 21:21.280]  and I think knowledgeable breeders,
[21:21.280 --> 21:23.760]  they know that because, you know,
[21:24.440 --> 21:25.280]  and that's why you see a lot of the IBLs
[21:25.280 --> 21:27.160]  that are out there are kind of heirloom varieties,
[21:27.160 --> 21:29.200]  like more of the Burmese or like the, you know,
[21:29.200 --> 21:31.920]  Cush's and some of these that we might consider
[21:31.920 --> 21:33.160]  land races or something.
[21:33.160 --> 21:37.960]  But yeah, so I mean, but then, like you said,
[21:37.960 --> 21:40.080]  you also have that cultural backlash where it's like,
[21:40.080 --> 21:42.280]  I'm, you know, and I'm guilty of it.
[21:42.280 --> 21:43.920]  Like I'm of the mindset of like,
[21:45.120 --> 21:47.480]  like I want everybody had to have
[21:47.480 --> 21:49.080]  kind of access to the plant.
[21:49.080 --> 21:53.160]  And so I tend to be more towards that open source
[21:53.640 --> 21:56.160]  kind of side, but it's like, you know, I also,
[21:56.160 --> 21:59.400]  I'm not, you know, I like, I have a degree,
[21:59.400 --> 22:01.040]  you know, undergraduate in economics.
[22:01.040 --> 22:03.200]  And so like, I understand like these companies
[22:03.200 --> 22:07.040]  that put all this money into R&D,
[22:07.040 --> 22:08.760]  you have to recoup that in some way.
[22:08.760 --> 22:11.640]  And like I said, the way that our society is set up,
[22:11.640 --> 22:15.000]  like those guys will dominate the market eventually
[22:15.000 --> 22:16.880]  and they have yet to enter the market.
[22:16.880 --> 22:20.360]  And I guarantee you, they already have their own lines
[22:20.360 --> 22:21.320]  that are probably, you know,
[22:21.360 --> 22:24.080]  they're probably using molecular breeding techniques
[22:24.080 --> 22:26.240]  with markers that are doing gene editing, you know?
[22:26.240 --> 22:28.440]  So, I mean, they have the technique, the money,
[22:28.440 --> 22:31.520]  the power to create completely uniform line,
[22:31.520 --> 22:33.320]  maybe, you know, zero THC, right?
[22:33.320 --> 22:34.160]  Delete the THC.
[22:34.160 --> 22:37.240]  It's like, so like, but where I'm coming from is like,
[22:37.240 --> 22:39.200]  there's also gonna be, you know, the heirloom guys
[22:39.200 --> 22:42.360]  that will always do kind of conventional
[22:42.360 --> 22:43.680]  or like traditional breeding
[22:43.680 --> 22:46.720]  through just like growing things out, selecting, you know?
[22:46.720 --> 22:49.880]  I mean, we do have access to cheap analytics nowadays.
[22:49.880 --> 22:51.480]  So it's like for a hemp breeder, you know,
[22:51.480 --> 22:53.720]  that's invaluable because like we are breeding
[22:53.720 --> 22:58.000]  for specific cannabinoids versus, you know,
[22:58.000 --> 22:59.680]  kind of like what are, you know,
[22:59.680 --> 23:01.720]  effects or looks or things like that.
[23:01.720 --> 23:03.760]  So, I mean, and then, you know,
[23:03.760 --> 23:06.280]  it also brings up like the goals and objectives
[23:06.280 --> 23:07.280]  as a breeder, right?
[23:07.280 --> 23:10.240]  It's like, I think where you're coming from
[23:10.240 --> 23:12.000]  is from a commercial perspective,
[23:12.000 --> 23:15.400]  but then there's a whole other side of like the home grower
[23:15.400 --> 23:17.600]  who's just growing for a medicinal
[23:17.600 --> 23:21.200]  or kind of like, you know, their own personal head stash.
[23:21.200 --> 23:23.880]  And in that case, maybe they don't necessarily want,
[23:23.880 --> 23:26.920]  you know, all of the same thing, right?
[23:26.920 --> 23:30.160]  They, like it goes back to varieties, the spice of life.
[23:31.720 --> 23:36.640]  So yeah, I see both sides and I think there's a way
[23:36.640 --> 23:39.880]  for a breeder to kind of choose a path
[23:39.880 --> 23:43.480]  and become commercially successful doing either one.
[23:43.480 --> 23:45.760]  But at the same time, like for me personally,
[23:45.760 --> 23:47.360]  like I have projects that are, you know,
[23:47.360 --> 23:51.360]  we're like, for example, I have like my original zombie line,
[23:51.360 --> 23:52.960]  it's a CBG by CBD hybrid.
[23:52.960 --> 23:54.240]  You know, we took that to F2
[23:54.240 --> 23:55.320]  and now we're taking it to F3.
[23:55.320 --> 23:58.560]  We'll be separating it into a CBG line and a CBD line.
[23:58.560 --> 24:00.280]  And maybe 10 years later, you know,
[24:00.280 --> 24:02.560]  all those will be true bred lines.
[24:03.720 --> 24:05.920]  But in the meantime, I'm also doing, you know,
[24:05.920 --> 24:09.120]  polyhybrids and doing land race hybrids
[24:09.120 --> 24:10.680]  or doing preservation projects,
[24:10.680 --> 24:14.280]  because it's kind of like, I just have my interests are broad
[24:14.280 --> 24:16.160]  and it's like, I just love growing the plants.
[24:16.160 --> 24:17.600]  Well, yeah, I was saying that's more fun.
[24:17.600 --> 24:21.240]  I mean, doing a single cross for eight years is not fun.
[24:21.240 --> 24:24.960]  It's laborious and right now nobody cares for it either.
[24:24.960 --> 24:27.000]  So yeah.
[24:27.000 --> 24:30.040]  And you know, talking about with some of these F2s,
[24:30.040 --> 24:32.280]  like with Oregon CBDs and how their F2s
[24:32.280 --> 24:34.000]  kind of expose themselves,
[24:34.000 --> 24:35.680]  it kind of goes down another slippery slope.
[24:35.680 --> 24:38.480]  And again, something Monsanto did, I think is what 1997,
[24:38.480 --> 24:40.580]  they came out with that Terminator gene.
[24:40.580 --> 24:42.920]  And so now they can put this gene in there
[24:42.920 --> 24:45.960]  that it just won't create a second, you know,
[24:45.960 --> 24:47.760]  a second generation.
[24:47.760 --> 24:49.120]  And again, there's a lot of doom and gloom
[24:49.120 --> 24:49.960]  around those ideas,
[24:49.960 --> 24:52.520]  but from a guy that enjoys the plant science,
[24:52.520 --> 24:55.880]  it's like, that is a way for breeders to maintain,
[24:55.880 --> 24:56.800]  you know, what they want,
[24:56.800 --> 24:58.280]  whether you agree with that or not, you know,
[24:58.280 --> 25:00.020]  I stand on the fence, I guess.
[25:01.240 --> 25:03.460]  Because I do want to support people putting money
[25:03.460 --> 25:05.080]  into these long-term projects.
[25:05.080 --> 25:08.320]  And so somehow they got to get their money back, you know,
[25:08.320 --> 25:10.160]  and then they talk about trader genes.
[25:10.160 --> 25:13.240]  I think Monsanto again, came out with that like 98.
[25:13.240 --> 25:15.120]  Now that stuff, no good.
[25:15.120 --> 25:17.160]  Like where you're putting in a gene
[25:17.160 --> 25:18.800]  and you're getting transgenic breeding,
[25:18.800 --> 25:21.000]  but you put in a gene that says,
[25:21.000 --> 25:23.840]  well, and it's saying this plant will only recognize
[25:23.840 --> 25:25.540]  this brand of fertilizer.
[25:25.540 --> 25:27.080]  And then you're brand marketing.
[25:27.080 --> 25:28.440]  So then you say, grow this corn,
[25:28.440 --> 25:30.280]  it only grows with my fertilizer.
[25:30.280 --> 25:32.600]  And that's been, that hasn't been allowed legally
[25:32.600 --> 25:35.540]  in legal breeding, but you know, stuff like that
[25:35.540 --> 25:36.720]  on the underground is happening.
[25:36.720 --> 25:41.480]  And so there is this fine line of science taking it too far
[25:41.480 --> 25:45.460]  and some of these companies like Monsanto taking it too far,
[25:45.460 --> 25:46.480]  but there is something to it.
[25:46.480 --> 25:48.960]  There is a reason some of these ideas started up
[25:48.960 --> 25:50.640]  and cannabis is getting to the point
[25:50.640 --> 25:52.840]  where they're realizing that they're like, okay,
[25:52.840 --> 25:55.580]  the way I do want to protect my work I've been doing,
[25:55.580 --> 25:59.600]  I do want to, you know, kind of create a name for myself
[25:59.600 --> 26:01.560]  without somebody else just, you know,
[26:01.560 --> 26:05.180]  buying the clone or whatever and cloning forward.
[26:05.180 --> 26:07.660]  And so, and you know, and with inbreeding,
[26:07.660 --> 26:09.060]  there's definitely downsides.
[26:09.060 --> 26:11.780]  Like there's inbreeding depression, you know,
[26:11.780 --> 26:14.980]  I think the old famous Darwin paper, you know,
[26:14.980 --> 26:16.900]  so you do get some downsides of inbreeding.
[26:16.900 --> 26:19.980]  So you always want both attempts at breeding.
[26:19.980 --> 26:22.220]  You always want to keep the gene pool diverse,
[26:22.220 --> 26:23.660]  but you still want to breed it down.
[26:23.660 --> 26:26.580]  And then, you know, even when a lot of breeding projects
[26:26.580 --> 26:28.340]  start with clones, you know,
[26:28.340 --> 26:30.780]  clones are predominantly heterozygous.
[26:30.780 --> 26:34.060]  So they're gonna want to revert quick.
[26:34.060 --> 26:36.980]  So they get that inbreeding depression, you know,
[26:36.980 --> 26:38.420]  it's usually in two or three generations
[26:38.420 --> 26:40.900]  that you see clones started degenerate.
[26:40.900 --> 26:44.240]  So it's mixing both worlds and kind of growing together.
[26:44.240 --> 26:46.380]  And ultimately, you know, and like I said,
[26:46.380 --> 26:48.460]  if a guy like me, ultimately I want to say,
[26:48.460 --> 26:51.700]  I want to put 2000 feminized seeds in my greenhouse
[26:51.700 --> 26:53.500]  and I all want them to look like this, you know,
[26:53.500 --> 26:54.420]  nice and perfect.
[26:54.420 --> 26:55.820]  It makes my life easier.
[26:55.820 --> 26:58.480]  And ultimately it makes things more efficient.
[26:58.480 --> 27:01.020]  It makes the final product cheaper to produce.
[27:01.020 --> 27:03.140]  And, you know, my goal is I want quality flower
[27:03.140 --> 27:04.080]  at a low price.
[27:04.080 --> 27:07.140]  And these are kind of the methods I see of getting there.
[27:08.920 --> 27:09.760]  Right, yeah.
[27:09.760 --> 27:12.460]  And, you know, and then it comes back to like
[27:12.460 --> 27:13.500]  the goals of the breeders.
[27:13.500 --> 27:16.020]  Like, are you breeding for a smokable product?
[27:16.020 --> 27:17.100]  You know, cause it's like,
[27:17.100 --> 27:19.460]  it's possible that a lot of these large scale farms
[27:19.460 --> 27:21.340]  that are, you know, growing thousands of acres
[27:21.340 --> 27:22.940]  or it's just gonna end up in extract.
[27:22.940 --> 27:24.460]  So you don't care if you have, you know,
[27:24.460 --> 27:27.680]  just one terpene dominant cultivar or something,
[27:27.680 --> 27:28.580]  you know, that, you know,
[27:28.580 --> 27:30.540]  that's all gonna be removed in the end.
[27:31.420 --> 27:33.740]  But yeah, as a farmer, you know,
[27:33.740 --> 27:35.300]  that's breeding for, you know,
[27:35.300 --> 27:38.660]  kind of terpene rich smokable flower,
[27:38.660 --> 27:41.500]  it's, you know, it's especially coming from CBD,
[27:41.500 --> 27:42.780]  whenever, you know, in the beginning,
[27:42.780 --> 27:45.660]  everything kind of had that cherry kind of flavor.
[27:45.660 --> 27:48.660]  And to, you know, within five years now,
[27:48.660 --> 27:51.660]  we're getting all kinds of kind of new profiles.
[27:51.660 --> 27:53.420]  And a lot of that is, you know,
[27:53.420 --> 27:57.260]  it's basically just small breeders for the most part,
[27:57.260 --> 27:59.440]  I think pushing the industry forward.
[27:59.440 --> 28:02.560]  And so, yeah, I mean, it will be interesting to see
[28:02.560 --> 28:06.440]  kind of like the divergent, you know,
[28:06.440 --> 28:08.000]  like where it goes ultimately.
[28:08.000 --> 28:09.720]  And I think we won't see that, you know,
[28:09.720 --> 28:12.320]  for who knows 10, 20 years, I think, you know,
[28:12.320 --> 28:15.240]  cause it legalization is really what's going to
[28:15.240 --> 28:19.000]  ultimately be the indicator of where we head, right?
[28:19.000 --> 28:21.800]  I mean, we're still operating in a somewhat
[28:21.800 --> 28:24.320]  kind of just gray area for the most part.
[28:24.320 --> 28:26.080]  And I think that's why you see,
[28:26.080 --> 28:27.720]  you don't see a lot of the stuff
[28:27.720 --> 28:29.280]  like you're talking about the production lines,
[28:30.120 --> 28:30.960]  because people are afraid that, you know,
[28:30.960 --> 28:31.800]  as soon as they put it out,
[28:31.800 --> 28:33.360]  it's just going to get knocked off.
[28:33.360 --> 28:34.760]  Right.
[28:34.760 --> 28:36.720]  Well, the market's changing so fast, you know,
[28:36.720 --> 28:39.200]  at first, like you said, it was all cherry wines
[28:39.200 --> 28:41.000]  and who knows and all of the cherry crosses
[28:41.000 --> 28:44.680]  and they smell the same and they're pretty, but not good.
[28:44.680 --> 28:46.880]  But then the market changes very swift
[28:46.880 --> 28:49.360]  to more of the smokable and then like CBG
[28:49.360 --> 28:51.600]  and all of the kind of minor cannabinoids
[28:51.600 --> 28:52.880]  became a popular thing.
[28:52.880 --> 28:55.520]  And now it's like, can you breed THCA varieties?
[28:55.520 --> 28:59.260]  And so it's hard for a crop that takes so long to perfect
[29:00.240 --> 29:03.060]  to try to always, you know, please the market.
[29:03.060 --> 29:04.580]  And so, yeah, it's tough.
[29:04.580 --> 29:06.060]  Yeah, it's a tough spot.
[29:06.060 --> 29:08.660]  And that's where I think both teams.
[29:08.660 --> 29:10.220]  Yeah, even like, for example,
[29:10.220 --> 29:12.820]  like I've noticed CBG flowered, you know,
[29:12.820 --> 29:15.060]  like that's my number one request as of late.
[29:15.060 --> 29:18.180]  And I think everybody kind of grew a bunch of CBG
[29:18.180 --> 29:21.060]  thinking it was the next big cannabinoid
[29:21.060 --> 29:22.900]  and they were just kind of flooded with it
[29:22.900 --> 29:25.620]  when the consumer wasn't even aware of what it was.
[29:25.620 --> 29:26.460]  Right.
[29:26.460 --> 29:29.060]  And so I think farmers kind of just moved away from there
[29:29.820 --> 29:31.540]  and wild products, you know, kind of lost value.
[29:31.540 --> 29:33.100]  And eventually they ended up liquidating it.
[29:33.100 --> 29:35.540]  And now not a lot of farms are growing it
[29:35.540 --> 29:38.540]  and not a lot of breeders were even focusing on it,
[29:38.540 --> 29:41.340]  you know, and so it's like, it's the same thing.
[29:41.340 --> 29:45.700]  The first CBG was pretty bland flavor wise.
[29:45.700 --> 29:47.120]  And so now you have, you know,
[29:47.120 --> 29:49.220]  like we've got several different CBG lines that,
[29:49.220 --> 29:52.260]  you know, are terpene rich or mixed ratio, CBD, CBG,
[29:52.260 --> 29:54.300]  which are some of my favorite.
[29:54.300 --> 29:56.580]  And I think it's, I don't know.
[29:56.580 --> 29:57.840]  I mean, at this point, you know,
[29:57.840 --> 30:00.480]  we're so early in the game that it goes back to like,
[30:00.480 --> 30:02.160]  I think, and that's the beautiful thing, right?
[30:02.160 --> 30:05.320]  With kind of a free market system is, you know,
[30:05.320 --> 30:07.840]  we're not like these established industries
[30:07.840 --> 30:11.920]  like energy or tech or where you can potentially
[30:11.920 --> 30:13.540]  be a small breeder in your garage.
[30:13.540 --> 30:16.080]  And if you put in the work and you sacrifice
[30:16.080 --> 30:17.280]  and you have the passion,
[30:17.280 --> 30:19.560]  you could potentially do it for a living.
[30:19.560 --> 30:21.620]  And I think that's kind of the background that I come from
[30:21.620 --> 30:24.920]  is like, you know, I've been on cannabis for 15 years.
[30:24.920 --> 30:26.520]  I went through the medical industry, you know,
[30:26.600 --> 30:29.480]  bred, you know, for 10 years and then done it, you know,
[30:29.480 --> 30:31.920]  breeding and cultivating commercially for the last,
[30:31.920 --> 30:34.280]  you know, four years, I guess, since 19.
[30:34.280 --> 30:38.200]  And those first two years I worked a full-time, you know,
[30:38.200 --> 30:40.880]  job and I did the hemp thing on the side.
[30:40.880 --> 30:43.040]  And so it wasn't like I just started a job
[30:43.040 --> 30:44.800]  and was, you know, paying the bills.
[30:44.800 --> 30:46.040]  And so I think, you know,
[30:46.040 --> 30:48.100]  that there is something to be said for the sacrifice
[30:48.100 --> 30:49.400]  and stuff that people make.
[30:49.400 --> 30:51.760]  And then also, you know, like you said,
[30:51.760 --> 30:53.160]  not all seed is created equal.
[30:53.160 --> 30:55.480]  And I think when you start a new industry,
[30:55.480 --> 30:58.840]  you look at any industry and it builds upon its mistakes
[30:58.840 --> 31:01.160]  and it builds upon everything that kind of came before it.
[31:01.160 --> 31:03.680]  And we're still in, especially, you know,
[31:03.680 --> 31:06.800]  the cannabis industry, we're still in its infancy.
[31:06.800 --> 31:09.520]  And I think one thing where the cannabis
[31:09.520 --> 31:12.760]  or the hemp side of things can go is like, you know,
[31:12.760 --> 31:14.160]  we have almost, you know,
[31:14.160 --> 31:16.500]  we have all the cannabinoids, right?
[31:16.500 --> 31:18.320]  Whereas like kind of the rec market
[31:18.320 --> 31:21.160]  is really geared towards THC and specific,
[31:21.160 --> 31:24.200]  specifically, and I think in my hopes are that
[31:24.200 --> 31:25.960]  they will eventually collide, right?
[31:25.960 --> 31:28.400]  I think that as the consumer becomes more educated
[31:28.400 --> 31:31.120]  and they wake up to the fact that these other kind of
[31:31.120 --> 31:33.080]  non-psychoactive cannabinoids
[31:33.080 --> 31:36.800]  actually do have some health benefit, you know,
[31:36.800 --> 31:40.920]  it will kind of catapult us into new areas.
[31:40.920 --> 31:44.040]  Yeah, no, I 100% think type twos are gonna be the future.
[31:44.040 --> 31:46.040]  I mean, they won't dominate,
[31:46.040 --> 31:48.360]  but I think they're gonna be a big part of what's out there.
[31:48.360 --> 31:50.560]  I think people are getting tired of just chasing
[31:50.560 --> 31:52.200]  30% THC cultivars.
[31:52.200 --> 31:54.360]  And especially for the older demographic of smokers,
[31:54.360 --> 31:56.080]  they're not looking for something
[31:56.080 --> 31:57.760]  that's gonna get them 100% lit, you know?
[31:57.760 --> 32:00.960]  So these type twos that are coming out are, you know,
[32:00.960 --> 32:02.400]  I've seen them gain popularity,
[32:02.400 --> 32:05.120]  at least in the small circles and who I talk to.
[32:05.120 --> 32:08.160]  But for me on, you know, what I call my breeding,
[32:08.160 --> 32:10.320]  just putting plants together in my greenhouse,
[32:10.320 --> 32:12.160]  that's always kind of where I'm looking at.
[32:12.160 --> 32:14.080]  Like, as I see plants in the mass,
[32:14.080 --> 32:17.200]  I'll grab one here or there just cause it's like,
[32:17.200 --> 32:18.960]  hey, these are cool, let's put them together.
[32:18.960 --> 32:20.920]  And then I can sit on these seeds and one day
[32:20.920 --> 32:23.160]  maybe somebody else can make something cool of them.
[32:23.160 --> 32:26.360]  But yeah, those type twos I think are gonna become
[32:26.360 --> 32:29.480]  more popular as the market matures, I think.
[32:31.120 --> 32:33.560]  Yeah, and yeah, no, I totally agree.
[32:33.560 --> 32:36.160]  And I think coming from like, you know, our hemp background,
[32:36.160 --> 32:39.280]  we deal with a lot of people that are more interested
[32:39.280 --> 32:40.600]  in the novel cannabinoids
[32:40.600 --> 32:43.000]  and maybe have a little more education about it
[32:43.000 --> 32:44.200]  because they're curious, right?
[32:44.200 --> 32:46.600]  Whereas like, I've got a lot of friends that are,
[32:46.600 --> 32:48.360]  you know, stoners, they don't,
[32:48.360 --> 32:50.200]  they kind of think it's a waste of time, you know?
[32:50.840 --> 32:52.800]  Yeah, I think a lot of people still think that,
[32:52.800 --> 32:55.640]  oh, hemp, you can, why are you guys smoking shirts?
[32:55.640 --> 32:57.480]  Yeah, I think there's a lot of that.
[32:57.480 --> 32:59.520]  Yeah, or why are you wasting your grow space
[32:59.520 --> 33:00.840]  on growing something that, you know,
[33:00.840 --> 33:02.280]  doesn't get you stoned and so,
[33:02.280 --> 33:04.080]  but I think that's a product of prohibition, right?
[33:04.080 --> 33:07.280]  It's like, you would never waste your space growing,
[33:07.280 --> 33:09.400]  you know, I mean, and that's even, you know,
[33:09.400 --> 33:11.880]  they're like speaking on land races and stuff,
[33:11.880 --> 33:13.760]  you know, a lot of them aren't the heaviest yielders
[33:13.760 --> 33:17.400]  or like, but they all, you know, as far as genetics go,
[33:17.400 --> 33:18.440]  they're extremely diverse
[33:18.440 --> 33:20.120]  and that's where we're actually pulling out
[33:20.920 --> 33:22.160]  a lot of these minor, you know, cannabinoids
[33:22.160 --> 33:25.960]  and so there's a place in the garden,
[33:25.960 --> 33:29.000]  but it's like now through legalization, you know,
[33:29.000 --> 33:31.680]  the people that are interested are no longer afraid of like,
[33:31.680 --> 33:34.040]  you know, getting busted or, you know, so it's like,
[33:34.040 --> 33:35.960]  it really is like a renaissance
[33:35.960 --> 33:38.160]  as far as like cannabis breeding goes
[33:38.160 --> 33:41.400]  and, you know, and I think it's hard to have a platform
[33:41.400 --> 33:43.760]  and like have a barrier to entry to get into, you know,
[33:43.760 --> 33:46.400]  to kind of get your work out there if you are a small breeder
[33:46.480 --> 33:50.000]  but I think if you, you know, if you do things right,
[33:50.840 --> 33:55.840]  I think you can offer something unique to the gene pool
[33:55.840 --> 33:58.440]  rather than, you know, like, you know,
[33:58.440 --> 34:00.440]  just crossing like the next like hype strain
[34:00.440 --> 34:01.440]  to hype strain, you know,
[34:01.440 --> 34:04.280]  and what ultimately ends up is just kind of like
[34:04.280 --> 34:07.680]  this bland product that looks good online,
[34:07.680 --> 34:10.840]  but in fact, when you consume it,
[34:10.840 --> 34:13.680]  it doesn't really hit the mark and I, you know,
[34:14.360 --> 34:16.080]  but that, you know, that can be sold to, you know,
[34:16.080 --> 34:17.320]  a novice consumer, right?
[34:17.320 --> 34:20.120]  Somebody that hasn't had, you know, legal cannabis,
[34:20.120 --> 34:22.720]  but eventually as legalization happens
[34:22.720 --> 34:25.560]  and people become, you know, consumers
[34:25.560 --> 34:27.760]  and become aware of what else is out there,
[34:28.640 --> 34:29.920]  their palates gonna change.
[34:29.920 --> 34:31.280]  And like you said, I think type twos
[34:31.280 --> 34:32.920]  will become more common.
[34:34.640 --> 34:38.200]  Yeah, and I think that's an important role as a breeder
[34:38.200 --> 34:41.560]  is like I grow out not only my own seed that I make,
[34:41.560 --> 34:44.160]  but, you know, countless others, you know, seed.
[34:44.160 --> 34:46.320]  And so it's like, I think, you know,
[34:46.320 --> 34:48.920]  your perception kind of determines your selection, right?
[34:48.920 --> 34:52.320]  So it's like, if, you know, you may, you know,
[34:52.320 --> 34:54.800]  you know, just cut, you know, like you may have,
[34:54.800 --> 34:56.880]  you may have only seen a few cannabis strains
[34:56.880 --> 34:58.880]  your whole life, you know, as a grower.
[34:58.880 --> 35:01.120]  And so you're, you know, you're basing what you think
[35:01.120 --> 35:03.680]  is good on something that may not necessarily be good
[35:03.680 --> 35:06.160]  to somebody that's grown out, you know,
[35:06.160 --> 35:08.000]  thousands of other varieties.
[35:08.000 --> 35:10.520]  And I think you coming from Colorado,
[35:10.520 --> 35:12.080]  obviously, you know, you've been like,
[35:12.080 --> 35:13.960]  you've had legal cannabis as long as I have here
[35:13.960 --> 35:14.800]  in Washington.
[35:14.800 --> 35:18.600]  And so in many ways we've grown up looking, consuming,
[35:18.600 --> 35:20.440]  and being kind of spoiled in many ways.
[35:20.440 --> 35:22.640]  And so, and you look to California,
[35:22.640 --> 35:24.120]  and I think that's where a lot of the, you know,
[35:24.120 --> 35:26.960]  some of the more successful breeders coming, you know,
[35:26.960 --> 35:30.360]  and then also combining that knowledge of culture
[35:30.360 --> 35:33.560]  and different, you know, types of cannabis
[35:33.560 --> 35:36.800]  with breeding techniques and kind of like, you know,
[35:36.800 --> 35:38.320]  the back, you know, so yeah.
[35:38.320 --> 35:40.440]  Yeah, and I think that's one cool thing
[35:40.440 --> 35:45.000]  that social media and Instagram is kind of brought
[35:45.000 --> 35:47.240]  to the cannabis culture as much as Instagram
[35:47.240 --> 35:49.200]  kind of negates what we do.
[35:49.200 --> 35:52.080]  But, you know, you figure prior to Instagram
[35:52.080 --> 35:55.320]  and legalization, you know, to see another grow,
[35:55.320 --> 35:57.440]  you had to know a dude and you had like,
[35:57.440 --> 35:59.520]  it wasn't just this, oh, let me go on Instagram
[35:59.520 --> 36:01.040]  and let me see how a thousand people
[36:01.040 --> 36:02.400]  are growing their plants.
[36:02.400 --> 36:04.040]  It was very controlled info.
[36:04.040 --> 36:07.760]  And I think that's still why you get this bro science
[36:08.200 --> 36:11.160]  kind of mentality because they all came, you know,
[36:11.160 --> 36:12.520]  everyone's doing their own experiment
[36:12.520 --> 36:14.000]  in their own little rooms.
[36:14.000 --> 36:15.840]  And then all of a sudden the doors are open
[36:15.840 --> 36:18.320]  and everyone's like, oh wait, I'm not doing this right.
[36:18.320 --> 36:20.600]  Or, oh, this guy's doing this much better than me.
[36:20.600 --> 36:22.320]  But then they tend to be stubborn and stick with it.
[36:22.320 --> 36:23.480]  Like, well, it's worked for me.
[36:23.480 --> 36:25.720]  And cannabis is a very resilient plant.
[36:25.720 --> 36:29.240]  It can grow, you know, from 40 degrees to 110 degrees,
[36:29.240 --> 36:31.080]  huge wide varieties.
[36:31.080 --> 36:32.600]  And so when people say, well, it worked for me
[36:32.600 --> 36:34.680]  and it worked for me, it's like, yeah, it probably did.
[36:34.680 --> 36:36.440]  Cannabis is a tough plant.
[36:36.440 --> 36:38.080]  But so it's trying to work through all that
[36:38.080 --> 36:40.400]  and figure out, all right, what's in the goal.
[36:40.400 --> 36:42.200]  And again, the goal, like you said a few times,
[36:42.200 --> 36:44.560]  it's different for me, my goal, you know,
[36:44.560 --> 36:48.560]  as a younger person growing up prior to legalization,
[36:48.560 --> 36:51.040]  my goal was always like, I remember talking,
[36:51.040 --> 36:52.520]  you'd go to the gas station and I'd be like,
[36:52.520 --> 36:54.720]  man, one day they're gonna have marijuana lights up there.
[36:54.720 --> 36:55.560]  And that was cool.
[36:55.560 --> 36:56.960]  Like that was something we aspire to.
[36:56.960 --> 36:59.240]  But you say that now and people just like,
[36:59.240 --> 37:01.400]  like, oh, well, that's corporate takeover.
[37:01.400 --> 37:05.380]  But back then it was like, man, if we could have it legal,
[37:05.380 --> 37:08.060]  we could have it accessible, like cheap.
[37:08.060 --> 37:10.060]  Those were the things we cared about.
[37:10.060 --> 37:14.020]  And now it's become this very, very connoisseur market.
[37:14.020 --> 37:16.380]  You know, there's this very, I mean,
[37:16.380 --> 37:17.860]  it's not even that old of a market.
[37:17.860 --> 37:20.620]  And we went from 10 years ago, just saying,
[37:20.620 --> 37:22.660]  here's my 20 bucks, let me get a Ziploc
[37:22.660 --> 37:24.060]  of whatever is in there.
[37:24.060 --> 37:25.980]  And you're happy doing it about your day.
[37:25.980 --> 37:28.660]  And nowadays it's, there's this full swing of,
[37:28.660 --> 37:30.660]  you know, it's very, as you know,
[37:30.660 --> 37:34.200]  it's like the connoisseur market is kind of taken over
[37:34.200 --> 37:36.360]  and it's speaking volumes, which is cool.
[37:36.360 --> 37:38.920]  They should be there, but not to take away
[37:38.920 --> 37:42.120]  from the fact that we still want to produce this,
[37:42.120 --> 37:43.800]  you know, as efficient as possible,
[37:43.800 --> 37:46.040]  to be as sustainable as possible
[37:46.040 --> 37:48.800]  and create a product that's safe for everybody to access.
[37:48.800 --> 37:49.620]  That's not expensive.
[37:49.620 --> 37:52.160]  And unfortunately, cannabis, it's getting there,
[37:52.160 --> 37:54.320]  but still I don't think as cheap as it could be.
[37:54.320 --> 37:57.080]  And I think a lot of people would disagree with that.
[37:57.080 --> 37:59.240]  But again, my goal is always efficiency.
[37:59.240 --> 38:01.640]  Like how can we make this efficient
[38:01.640 --> 38:04.140]  without losing quality and all that kind of stuff?
[38:05.440 --> 38:07.600]  Yeah, no, absolutely, man.
[38:07.600 --> 38:10.520]  And like, that's one of my goals as a breeder is like,
[38:10.520 --> 38:12.840]  I think, you know, and it may upset a lot of people,
[38:12.840 --> 38:14.720]  but it's like, I hope that, you know,
[38:14.720 --> 38:17.600]  cannabis hemp seed would be as cheap as veggie seeds
[38:17.600 --> 38:19.160]  that you could go buy it at every, you know,
[38:19.160 --> 38:22.480]  your hardware store next to your, you know,
[38:22.480 --> 38:24.800]  lettuce and tomatoes like that is.
[38:24.800 --> 38:28.040]  And I mean, there are heirloom, you know,
[38:28.040 --> 38:30.920]  veggie breeders that are successful, you know, regional,
[38:30.920 --> 38:33.040]  they breed for their region and you can go in
[38:33.040 --> 38:35.160]  and they're small farms.
[38:35.160 --> 38:38.400]  Like one of my favorite on the West Coast
[38:38.400 --> 38:39.840]  is Strictly Medicinal.
[38:39.840 --> 38:41.040]  You know, I'll just give them a shout out.
[38:41.040 --> 38:43.840]  They, all kinds of, you know, medicinal starts
[38:43.840 --> 38:46.560]  and it's just a small family, small family farm
[38:46.560 --> 38:49.760]  that has been operating and growing for probably decades,
[38:49.760 --> 38:50.600]  you know?
[38:50.600 --> 38:55.520]  And so, yeah, I think that is an important aspect.
[38:55.520 --> 38:57.960]  And then like to speak to efficiency as a breeder,
[38:57.960 --> 39:00.120]  I think that's one of the most important aspects,
[39:00.120 --> 39:03.240]  like for me, I've been able to create a system
[39:03.240 --> 39:05.840]  where I can like sell my pheno hunted flower.
[39:05.840 --> 39:09.280]  So like, there's no, like, you know, waste
[39:09.280 --> 39:12.920]  as far as like what I'm doing, right?
[39:12.920 --> 39:17.920]  So it's like, I can, you know, capture, you know,
[39:17.920 --> 39:19.720]  that like, whereas like a lot of people,
[39:19.720 --> 39:21.360]  I don't know if they have that opportunity,
[39:21.360 --> 39:23.760]  but it's like, I've kind of figured out a system
[39:23.760 --> 39:27.560]  where it's like, you know, before I thought, you know,
[39:27.560 --> 39:30.080]  I kind of had to do the pheno hunts and chalk it up.
[39:31.040 --> 39:32.120]  So like, you know, whatever, and then do, you know,
[39:32.120 --> 39:34.880]  clone runs to have that kind of uniformity.
[39:34.880 --> 39:37.640]  And in fact, I did a couple of those, you know,
[39:37.640 --> 39:39.280]  it was like early last year,
[39:39.280 --> 39:41.520]  and kind of grew the same things round after round.
[39:41.520 --> 39:44.400]  And the customers got tired of it.
[39:44.400 --> 39:45.520]  Like they wanted the new,
[39:45.520 --> 39:48.160]  like they wanted to be the first ones to try something.
[39:48.160 --> 39:52.440]  And so, and, you know, and as a breeder too,
[39:52.440 --> 39:54.480]  like it was, you know,
[39:54.480 --> 39:56.880]  I think I have to give a shout out to Thomas
[39:56.920 --> 40:00.440]  at High Alpine because he kind of gave me a hand up
[40:00.440 --> 40:03.280]  as far as like vouching and kind of giving me a platform,
[40:03.280 --> 40:05.560]  but it's still hard to get people to grow your seed
[40:05.560 --> 40:07.440]  if they've never, you know, they don't know who you are.
[40:07.440 --> 40:10.360]  And so I made an effort to grow my own seed,
[40:10.360 --> 40:13.160]  produce the flower, and then kind of put that on the market
[40:13.160 --> 40:14.680]  and then be like, you know, so it's like,
[40:14.680 --> 40:17.840]  you do have to put the work in too as a breeder.
[40:17.840 --> 40:19.720]  And if nobody's willing to vouch for you,
[40:19.720 --> 40:22.680]  you kind of have to put yourself out on the line.
[40:22.680 --> 40:26.360]  And so, I mean, just coming, you know, like we,
[40:27.120 --> 40:28.720]  we're a pretty small company, you know,
[40:28.720 --> 40:31.200]  it's just me and my wife doing the majority.
[40:31.200 --> 40:32.400]  Like I do most of the cultivating
[40:32.400 --> 40:33.760]  and my wife handles the office,
[40:33.760 --> 40:35.400]  which is like 50, 60 hours a week.
[40:35.400 --> 40:37.520]  You know, it's not easy doing what we do,
[40:37.520 --> 40:39.480]  but you know, we do it because we love it.
[40:39.480 --> 40:43.440]  And I think it goes back to like,
[40:43.440 --> 40:46.440]  this is a, you know, kind of a new emerging industry
[40:46.440 --> 40:51.240]  and there is room for people to grow a small family business
[40:51.240 --> 40:52.920]  if you have what it takes, you know,
[40:52.920 --> 40:55.320]  if you're willing to take those opportunity costs
[40:55.320 --> 40:57.680]  and kind of like forego and sacrifice.
[40:57.680 --> 40:59.400]  And it's like building any business, you know,
[40:59.400 --> 41:01.560]  you got it, it's sweat equity, you know,
[41:01.560 --> 41:02.800]  it's working late hours.
[41:02.800 --> 41:06.880]  And ultimately I think if you're producing a good product
[41:06.880 --> 41:10.240]  in the end, you know, you can be successful.
[41:10.240 --> 41:12.640]  Whereas like a lot of the, you know,
[41:12.640 --> 41:14.040]  a lot of these businesses,
[41:14.040 --> 41:15.760]  and well, and I mean, we can say that
[41:15.760 --> 41:17.160]  for every breeder right now,
[41:17.160 --> 41:19.880]  even Oregon CBD had kind of small roots, right?
[41:19.880 --> 41:22.320]  They just were in the right place at the right time.
[41:22.320 --> 41:23.920]  And then they took the knowledge
[41:23.920 --> 41:25.200]  and reinvested in themselves
[41:25.200 --> 41:27.760]  and grew to what they are today.
[41:27.760 --> 41:30.560]  And I think they can be a kind of a model
[41:30.560 --> 41:31.760]  for other breeders.
[41:31.760 --> 41:34.280]  But with that said, you know,
[41:34.280 --> 41:36.400]  like I came into this a little late,
[41:36.400 --> 41:39.200]  like I think Oregon and Colorado had two years jump
[41:39.200 --> 41:42.400]  and you had breeders that were selling shitty seed
[41:42.400 --> 41:44.240]  and making millions of dollars, you know,
[41:44.240 --> 41:48.520]  and then maybe they didn't realize like what, you know,
[41:48.520 --> 41:50.680]  what catapulted them to success, right?
[41:50.680 --> 41:52.440]  And a lot of those breeders aren't around today.
[41:52.440 --> 41:55.360]  Like even breeders that I started with in 2019,
[41:55.360 --> 41:57.080]  I mean, I could probably name on one hand
[41:57.080 --> 41:59.880]  the breeders that I kind of came up with.
[41:59.880 --> 42:03.520]  And so, I mean, you too, you've been through that, right?
[42:03.520 --> 42:05.040]  Right, I was gonna say, we kind of went through
[42:05.040 --> 42:07.080]  the same thing, you know, at CSU when I first started
[42:07.080 --> 42:10.280]  and this would have been 2017, 2018,
[42:10.280 --> 42:13.000]  we were doing research trials.
[42:13.000 --> 42:14.480]  And so we had hemp in the greenhouse there.
[42:14.480 --> 42:18.600]  And then, so New West Genetics was a company at the time,
[42:18.600 --> 42:19.840]  Dr. McKay there.
[42:19.840 --> 42:21.480]  And so he had plants going.
[42:21.520 --> 42:25.040]  And so we would exchange males and females within the crop,
[42:25.040 --> 42:28.560]  but at his time, and it's still his focus is fiber
[42:28.560 --> 42:30.400]  and field production and field crops.
[42:30.400 --> 42:32.320]  And so I think he was setting a good example
[42:32.320 --> 42:33.840]  of what breeding should look like
[42:33.840 --> 42:36.720]  because he's coming from that academic side of it.
[42:36.720 --> 42:38.000]  So he had that rigor and,
[42:38.000 --> 42:40.320]  but he was slow behind to create varieties.
[42:40.320 --> 42:44.520]  And so there was this need in the market where it was 2018.
[42:44.520 --> 42:47.000]  Now all of these farmers out here in Colorado
[42:47.000 --> 42:50.920]  wanted to convert their alfalfa or their wheat to hemp.
[42:51.360 --> 42:54.120]  And so there was this quick need of thousands of thousands
[42:54.120 --> 42:56.520]  of seeds to, you know, fill a hundred acres
[42:56.520 --> 42:58.360]  or 500 acre parcels.
[42:58.360 --> 43:01.120]  And so then these, you know, nefarious breeders
[43:01.120 --> 43:04.080]  would just show up and be like, oh yeah, I got, here you go.
[43:04.080 --> 43:08.680]  Here's a, you know, feminized seed, $4 a piece.
[43:08.680 --> 43:10.660]  This is gonna make you millions.
[43:10.660 --> 43:12.240]  And these poor farmers didn't know any different.
[43:12.240 --> 43:13.560]  They're like, oh, how much will I make?
[43:13.560 --> 43:15.240]  $4 a seed, that seems like a lot.
[43:15.240 --> 43:17.880]  So they'd spend, you know, half a million dollars on seeds.
[43:17.880 --> 43:18.880]  They weren't feminized.
[43:18.880 --> 43:20.240]  They weren't even the same genetics.
[43:20.240 --> 43:21.680]  The company would disappear.
[43:21.680 --> 43:24.000]  And so I know a lot of stories like that.
[43:24.000 --> 43:26.080]  And that's the thing with breeding.
[43:26.080 --> 43:28.840]  And I guess, again, that touches on, is it too easy?
[43:28.840 --> 43:32.800]  Because if you can, doing it incorrectly can be easy.
[43:32.800 --> 43:34.400]  You can just smash them together.
[43:34.400 --> 43:36.240]  You could put a fake name on it, you know,
[43:36.240 --> 43:39.420]  blueberry mushroom pie or whatever, and send it out there.
[43:39.420 --> 43:41.160]  Put some cool pictures of a plant that, you know,
[43:41.160 --> 43:42.960]  doesn't look anything like what it turns out.
[43:42.960 --> 43:45.120]  And so there's room for a lot of people
[43:45.120 --> 43:46.120]  to come in and do that.
[43:46.120 --> 43:48.240]  And so having the integrity of a company that says,
[43:49.200 --> 43:51.960]  we put in the work, we really stand behind these lines
[43:51.960 --> 43:55.480]  and create it, is, I think, different.
[43:55.480 --> 43:57.680]  And so both of those, and again, like I've said before,
[43:57.680 --> 43:59.280]  I mean, there's no room for the nefarious people
[43:59.280 --> 44:00.740]  just lying out there,
[44:00.740 --> 44:03.040]  but there is room for the people creating, you know,
[44:03.040 --> 44:04.840]  I kind of equate it to like,
[44:04.840 --> 44:07.120]  or I guess a metaphor would be like gold miners.
[44:07.120 --> 44:08.220]  You have the prospectors,
[44:08.220 --> 44:10.300]  which I think are like the small breeders.
[44:10.300 --> 44:11.640]  They're out there finding it.
[44:11.640 --> 44:12.560]  They're putting the work in,
[44:12.560 --> 44:13.680]  they're traveling up the mountain, you know,
[44:13.680 --> 44:16.120]  they're looking for the shiny rocks.
[44:16.120 --> 44:18.040]  But once they find it,
[44:18.040 --> 44:19.520]  their kind of excitement withers
[44:19.520 --> 44:21.100]  and they want to go find a new one.
[44:21.100 --> 44:23.880]  But that's when, you know, the long-term breeders show up
[44:23.880 --> 44:26.160]  and they build a mine and they trudge it out
[44:26.160 --> 44:28.120]  and they get the gold and they produce it.
[44:28.120 --> 44:30.940]  And so you need both of those actors there,
[44:30.940 --> 44:32.520]  but they're doing different things.
[44:32.520 --> 44:34.960]  And so I think as long as we both have
[44:34.960 --> 44:36.660]  somebody creating the new varieties
[44:36.660 --> 44:38.000]  and then somebody stabilizing it
[44:38.000 --> 44:39.560]  to make sure it sticks around,
[44:39.560 --> 44:43.320]  is I guess what I would envision being ideal.
[44:43.320 --> 44:44.160]  Yeah.
[44:44.160 --> 44:45.120]  Yeah, and I think like, you know,
[44:45.120 --> 44:46.720]  and especially in new industries,
[44:46.720 --> 44:48.880]  there always tends to be a gold rush, right?
[44:48.880 --> 44:51.120]  And that's where you have room for scammers,
[44:51.120 --> 44:54.040]  but you'll never build a long-term company
[44:54.040 --> 44:55.200]  selling shoddy seed.
[44:55.200 --> 44:56.840]  You'll never get that return customer.
[44:56.840 --> 44:58.720]  And I think any breeder can agree
[44:58.720 --> 45:02.040]  that it's the return customers that keep you alive.
[45:02.040 --> 45:04.960]  You know, like you don't need a big, you know,
[45:04.960 --> 45:06.520]  you don't need a lot of customers
[45:06.520 --> 45:07.880]  if they're return customers, you know?
[45:07.880 --> 45:11.760]  And like you can create a solid base, a solid following.
[45:11.760 --> 45:14.360]  And I think, you know,
[45:14.360 --> 45:16.080]  and there's something to be said for that.
[45:16.080 --> 45:19.280]  And I think that, you know, in the long-term,
[45:19.280 --> 45:20.360]  and it goes back, you know,
[45:20.360 --> 45:22.680]  only time will tell who kind of sticks around
[45:22.680 --> 45:24.320]  and what their contributions are
[45:25.720 --> 45:27.800]  to the gene pool, to the industry.
[45:28.920 --> 45:30.840]  But yeah, to bring it back, like is breeding too easy?
[45:30.840 --> 45:33.520]  You know, like for us, the standard is, you know,
[45:33.520 --> 45:34.960]  feminized production seed,
[45:34.960 --> 45:37.620]  which can't, you know, kind of go unnoticed.
[45:37.620 --> 45:39.640]  Whereas like male, female breeding is easy.
[45:39.640 --> 45:42.160]  Like you can do that accidentally, right?
[45:42.160 --> 45:44.000]  And I don't even think that's, you know,
[45:44.000 --> 45:48.400]  and like also too, it's like, at what point do we begin,
[45:48.400 --> 45:50.160]  you know, is it breeding, right?
[45:50.160 --> 45:52.560]  Like pollen chucking necessarily isn't breed, is it,
[45:52.560 --> 45:53.480]  does that, you know,
[45:53.480 --> 45:55.000]  you have to kind of like peel back the layers.
[45:55.000 --> 45:56.640]  Is it an intention and a goal?
[45:56.640 --> 45:59.000]  Because breeding is always to improve
[45:59.000 --> 46:00.280]  upon the previous, right?
[46:00.280 --> 46:04.360]  And so, I mean, so you kind of have to, you know,
[46:04.360 --> 46:05.780]  understand the definition,
[46:05.780 --> 46:08.320]  but feminizing seed isn't the easiest.
[46:08.320 --> 46:11.560]  I mean, I had three failed feminized runs last year.
[46:11.560 --> 46:13.200]  And so like that, that's gonna keep,
[46:13.200 --> 46:15.240]  that's gonna keep a lot of people out of the game.
[46:15.240 --> 46:16.960]  Just to keep-
[46:16.960 --> 46:18.280]  That alone keeps me out of it.
[46:18.280 --> 46:20.760]  I think I've failed as much as Thomas has tried to help
[46:20.760 --> 46:21.600]  with the formula.
[46:21.600 --> 46:25.740]  I failed at it every time, but yeah, exactly.
[46:25.740 --> 46:26.580]  Yeah, no.
[46:26.580 --> 46:29.840]  And so like, and even, and I mean, most breeders that,
[46:29.840 --> 46:32.400]  you know, have successful feminized runs will tell you,
[46:32.400 --> 46:36.480]  you know, they fail, you know, each year, I think,
[46:36.480 --> 46:39.600]  you know, you have stuff that won't reverse,
[46:39.600 --> 46:40.760]  no matter how hard you try,
[46:40.760 --> 46:43.920]  you'll have stuff that will reverse, but not drop pollen.
[46:43.920 --> 46:47.680]  And so, you know, and a lot of that is kind of like,
[46:47.680 --> 46:49.440]  you know, variety specific,
[46:49.440 --> 46:52.120]  and some will just reverse, you know, with a few sprays.
[46:52.120 --> 46:54.600]  And so, and then it's also, you know, like you said,
[46:54.600 --> 46:57.520]  you have to know the recipe and the technique, you know,
[46:57.520 --> 47:00.200]  you generally wanna feminize,
[47:00.200 --> 47:02.520]  flip and feminize those earlier because, you know,
[47:02.520 --> 47:05.240]  they feminized plants take longer to drop pollen
[47:05.240 --> 47:06.520]  than like a regular male would.
[47:06.520 --> 47:09.640]  And so, and all that stuff is like, you know,
[47:09.640 --> 47:11.440]  that's not anything I read in a book, you know,
[47:11.440 --> 47:14.680]  that's just failing over and over and trying.
[47:14.680 --> 47:15.880]  And I think that's where we're at.
[47:15.880 --> 47:17.360]  And so it's like, we have the time.
[47:17.360 --> 47:21.360]  And it's like, once you figure out a system that works,
[47:21.360 --> 47:23.440]  and that's part of the reason why I'm here today too.
[47:23.440 --> 47:27.400]  It's like, I think you hold a lot of knowledge in your head,
[47:27.400 --> 47:29.640]  you know, just from experience and what you've gone through
[47:29.640 --> 47:30.920]  and same with me.
[47:30.920 --> 47:33.840]  And I'm at the point where like, I work alone all day long
[47:33.840 --> 47:35.160]  and I don't talk to a lot of people.
[47:36.000 --> 47:38.080]  This is like therapeutic, you know, in many ways,
[47:38.080 --> 47:39.120]  this is kind of like cathartic,
[47:39.120 --> 47:40.400]  like getting on and talking to somebody
[47:40.400 --> 47:41.760]  that has a similar passion.
[47:41.760 --> 47:42.840]  For sure.
[47:42.840 --> 47:45.840]  And so like, so yeah, no, I think,
[47:45.840 --> 47:48.640]  but yeah, feminizing, it's not easy.
[47:48.640 --> 47:50.520]  And that is the standard in the hemp industry.
[47:50.520 --> 47:51.360]  And I think that will be,
[47:51.360 --> 47:53.960]  and it's becoming the standard in the cannabis industries,
[47:53.960 --> 47:56.440]  particularly for production lines.
[47:56.440 --> 47:57.280]  Absolutely.
[47:57.280 --> 47:58.480]  Well, so let me ask you this then,
[47:58.480 --> 48:01.840]  why, cause I've looked in the past and there's a few places,
[48:01.840 --> 48:04.880]  but why is feminized pollen not being sold more often?
[48:05.600 --> 48:06.440]  It seems like that would be pretty lucrative.
[48:06.440 --> 48:09.400]  Does it just not stay viable or,
[48:09.400 --> 48:11.040]  cause it seems like an easy way to get somebody,
[48:11.040 --> 48:13.400]  get over that barrier of entry and create a valuable product.
[48:13.400 --> 48:15.960]  I mean, you guys can sell that a hundred dollars a gram.
[48:15.960 --> 48:17.480]  I mean, more than that.
[48:17.480 --> 48:19.680]  Yeah, no, and I have sold it in the past and stuff.
[48:19.680 --> 48:21.880]  I mean, the main issue is stability, right?
[48:21.880 --> 48:25.920]  Like I, so in order to prevent failed pollinations,
[48:25.920 --> 48:29.080]  I, you know, typically I have my number one like choice,
[48:29.080 --> 48:30.160]  right?
[48:30.160 --> 48:33.200]  And as of late, I've started doing backup reversals
[48:33.200 --> 48:34.400]  and storing pollen.
[48:34.920 --> 48:38.080]  But even then I would never count on stored pollen
[48:38.080 --> 48:40.960]  as my go, like, oh, I've got this stored pollen.
[48:40.960 --> 48:42.240]  That's going to be my next project.
[48:42.240 --> 48:44.720]  Like I just, cause I've had, I've had those fail.
[48:44.720 --> 48:46.720]  And so it's, you can, you know,
[48:46.720 --> 48:49.200]  you can do every precaution as far as making sure
[48:49.200 --> 48:51.640]  your pollen is completely dry, using desiccants,
[48:51.640 --> 48:54.960]  storing it in a completely sealed container in your fridge.
[48:54.960 --> 48:58.600]  But, and you can pull out pollen that is years old
[48:58.600 --> 48:59.880]  and it'll pollinate just fine.
[48:59.880 --> 49:01.720]  Or you can pull out pollen that's six months old.
[49:01.720 --> 49:04.200]  And I don't know what, you know,
[49:04.960 --> 49:05.800]  I don't have a specific answer.
[49:05.800 --> 49:08.480]  I mean, there could have just been one factor that wasn't,
[49:09.320 --> 49:11.960]  you know, that was out of my control
[49:11.960 --> 49:13.520]  that I didn't, you know, account for.
[49:13.520 --> 49:15.840]  And I think that's a part of it because, you know,
[49:15.840 --> 49:17.520]  you might have, you know,
[49:17.520 --> 49:20.080]  eight out of 10 pollen sales are just fine,
[49:20.080 --> 49:20.920]  but then you get, you know,
[49:20.920 --> 49:24.160]  you sell a couple of grams and it's a failed product.
[49:24.160 --> 49:26.360]  But it could almost be as traditional seeds are.
[49:26.360 --> 49:28.600]  You could say, well, it's kind of, you know,
[49:28.600 --> 49:30.360]  it's kind of an as, it's, you know,
[49:30.360 --> 49:32.680]  the phenol, it kind of is what it is.
[49:32.680 --> 49:34.440]  And I think a lot of,
[49:34.440 --> 49:37.440]  cause you can look at a lot of seed customers or consumers
[49:37.440 --> 49:39.800]  and like the small scale guys, like the guys buying,
[49:39.800 --> 49:42.760]  you know, $300 cookie or whatever.
[49:43.720 --> 49:46.400]  They're very forgiving consumers.
[49:46.400 --> 49:49.000]  They'll spend $150 on a seed that produces a male
[49:49.000 --> 49:50.240]  and they're happy about it.
[49:50.240 --> 49:52.880]  And so, I guess that's what I poke fun at a little bit.
[49:52.880 --> 49:55.560]  It's like, if you're gonna spend that much money,
[49:55.560 --> 49:58.200]  it better be an inbred line that's gonna produce
[49:58.200 --> 49:59.920]  amazing results forever.
[49:59.920 --> 50:02.880]  But that's, consumers just, they're not there.
[50:02.880 --> 50:06.560]  They're just like, yeah, whatever it is, I'm happy with it.
[50:06.560 --> 50:07.400]  So yeah.
[50:07.400 --> 50:08.240]  Yeah, that is funny.
[50:08.240 --> 50:10.840]  I mean, like I remember the candy rain fiasco,
[50:10.840 --> 50:12.960]  like $500 packs that were all,
[50:12.960 --> 50:14.120]  like none of them germinated.
[50:14.120 --> 50:16.720]  Like I had a buddy and, I mean, you could,
[50:16.720 --> 50:18.240]  people found decent stuff in there,
[50:18.240 --> 50:21.120]  but yeah, I mean, I'm a consumer myself.
[50:21.120 --> 50:22.080]  I mean, I probably, you know,
[50:22.080 --> 50:23.480]  like people scroll social media,
[50:23.480 --> 50:24.960]  like I scroll seed banks, you know?
[50:24.960 --> 50:27.440]  It's like, I'm always like, I'm out there looking,
[50:27.640 --> 50:30.120]  so I mean, I grow a lot of stuff out
[50:30.120 --> 50:32.440]  and like I'll be the, like I found a male
[50:32.440 --> 50:34.480]  in Oregon CBD's Pinewalker, you know,
[50:34.480 --> 50:35.480]  their triploid variety,
[50:35.480 --> 50:37.960]  like a full blown resinous stinky male
[50:37.960 --> 50:40.040]  and like, and the pollen was viable.
[50:40.040 --> 50:41.920]  So like, even the best of us,
[50:41.920 --> 50:43.840]  you know, there's no foolproof way.
[50:43.840 --> 50:45.280]  I mean, and that goes back,
[50:45.280 --> 50:48.800]  like maybe these Monsanto types will get to the point
[50:48.800 --> 50:51.560]  through genetic engineering that they can kind of
[50:51.560 --> 50:52.840]  prevent that from happening.
[50:52.840 --> 50:54.480]  Yeah, well, I think even the best is,
[50:54.480 --> 50:58.160]  they say is 99%, I think is what most of these companies
[50:58.160 --> 50:59.400]  will stick by, like, you know,
[50:59.400 --> 51:00.560]  Johnny's and some of these,
[51:00.560 --> 51:04.240]  they'll say 99% is kind of the best we can get.
[51:04.240 --> 51:06.760]  Yeah, I mean, I think even for cannabis,
[51:06.760 --> 51:08.560]  it's probably less, I mean, we can,
[51:08.560 --> 51:09.840]  most viewers can put that on there,
[51:09.840 --> 51:12.120]  but you know, that was growing 50 seeds out,
[51:12.120 --> 51:13.640]  you know, of the Pinewalkers.
[51:13.640 --> 51:16.480]  And I mean, I was happy, like I was stoked that I found,
[51:16.480 --> 51:17.800]  you know, but I mean, it's,
[51:17.800 --> 51:21.080]  so that's probably, you know, one of the top breeders,
[51:21.080 --> 51:23.440]  but so it's gonna happen.
[51:23.440 --> 51:25.760]  And I think as, you know,
[51:25.760 --> 51:28.120]  I think there's also consumers that are extremely hard,
[51:28.120 --> 51:31.120]  you know, sometimes too, that may judge too early,
[51:31.120 --> 51:33.560]  but I mean, like, I'm, you know,
[51:33.560 --> 51:35.840]  like I've grown out breeders that I trusted
[51:35.840 --> 51:37.840]  and, you know, some of my favorite breeders
[51:37.840 --> 51:39.880]  and had, you know, like intersex issues
[51:39.880 --> 51:42.160]  and like, and I'm guilty of it too, right?
[51:42.160 --> 51:44.160]  You're like, you just, you know,
[51:44.160 --> 51:46.000]  you can test your lines as best as you could
[51:46.000 --> 51:48.000]  and then somebody could grow it in a different environment
[51:48.000 --> 51:51.280]  or stress it out and they're able to do
[51:51.280 --> 51:52.120]  what you couldn't do.
[51:52.160 --> 51:55.360]  And so, I mean, this plant is, you know,
[51:55.360 --> 51:57.000]  it's designed to survive, right?
[51:57.000 --> 51:58.360]  So intersex is built into it,
[51:58.360 --> 52:01.640]  no matter how much we try and breed it out,
[52:01.640 --> 52:05.680]  like, you know, I mean, that's just part of it.
[52:05.680 --> 52:09.640]  And it's, you know, so, but yeah, no,
[52:09.640 --> 52:12.360]  I think overall there's something to be said
[52:12.360 --> 52:13.720]  for kind of raising the standards
[52:13.720 --> 52:16.280]  and as long as the consumer is, you know,
[52:16.280 --> 52:21.280]  content with polyhybrids and a lower standard of seed,
[52:21.520 --> 52:23.000]  then that will be the case.
[52:23.000 --> 52:26.480]  But, I mean, it will be these production guys,
[52:26.480 --> 52:28.240]  like the bigger farmers, you know, right?
[52:28.240 --> 52:31.560]  In a lot of places, legal farms are limited by canopy.
[52:31.560 --> 52:34.200]  And so clones are still the, you know,
[52:34.200 --> 52:37.240]  the cost it takes to clone is still justified,
[52:37.240 --> 52:41.920]  but like you're entering a time where I think, you know,
[52:41.920 --> 52:43.840]  like I'm kind of, like I still, you know,
[52:43.840 --> 52:46.240]  have a lot of friends in the cannabis industry
[52:46.240 --> 52:47.800]  and the rec industry on the West Coast
[52:47.800 --> 52:52.800]  and for high grade cannabis, you know, like top shelf,
[52:53.120 --> 52:55.320]  their, you know, farms are struggling
[52:55.320 --> 52:57.120]  to get $800 a pound, you know?
[52:57.120 --> 52:59.960]  Yeah, I mean, Colorado were 500.
[52:59.960 --> 53:01.960]  Yeah, yeah, you know, I mean, yeah,
[53:01.960 --> 53:04.640]  for like your average flower, I mean,
[53:04.640 --> 53:06.400]  you're going down to the, yeah, three, 500,
[53:06.400 --> 53:09.640]  but I'm talking like premium indoor top shelf,
[53:09.640 --> 53:13.760]  like, you know, cured properly, like $800, which is insane.
[53:13.760 --> 53:15.520]  Like, you know, you're barely making money
[53:15.520 --> 53:18.400]  and that's just where their mark, you know,
[53:18.400 --> 53:19.240]  kind of the market's at.
[53:19.240 --> 53:21.320]  Yeah, well, and that's, and I mean,
[53:21.320 --> 53:22.880]  and this could, I guess, be a topic
[53:22.880 --> 53:24.360]  for a whole other debate,
[53:24.360 --> 53:26.600]  but that's the key of the research we've been doing
[53:26.600 --> 53:29.320]  out here the last, you know, 10 years
[53:29.320 --> 53:32.360]  since I built the greenhouse is how efficient can we do it?
[53:32.360 --> 53:34.720]  That was always my most important bragging point
[53:34.720 --> 53:36.240]  is my total cost per pound.
[53:36.240 --> 53:37.560]  And you talked to a lot of growers,
[53:37.560 --> 53:38.400]  they don't even know what,
[53:38.400 --> 53:39.840]  they don't even know the cost per pound.
[53:39.840 --> 53:42.280]  It's more about, so, you know,
[53:42.280 --> 53:43.600]  and we were at our best run.
[53:43.600 --> 53:45.480]  We were down to our cost per pound,
[53:45.480 --> 53:48.200]  this includes labor, energy, everything.
[53:48.200 --> 53:51.680]  We're around 50 to 60 bucks was our total cost per pound.
[53:51.680 --> 53:55.280]  So at that point, $800, $500, that's a lot of profit.
[53:55.280 --> 53:57.160]  And so, and that was kind of the mantra
[53:57.160 --> 53:59.760]  I was trying to, you know, pass on to everybody.
[53:59.760 --> 54:02.640]  It's like, you can do this without all the lighting,
[54:02.640 --> 54:04.440]  without all, it's like, you're not going to have
[54:04.440 --> 54:06.440]  as big of yields and all that,
[54:06.440 --> 54:09.080]  but if the market's gonna flood in, you know,
[54:09.080 --> 54:11.280]  if you're dealing with $500 pounds,
[54:11.280 --> 54:13.160]  it doesn't matter how pretty your flower is.
[54:14.000 --> 54:14.840]  You know, cause a lot of these guys,
[54:14.840 --> 54:17.120]  their cost of production, indoor facilities,
[54:17.120 --> 54:19.400]  600 bucks a pound is usually their cost of production.
[54:19.400 --> 54:21.040]  I think that's coming down a little bit,
[54:21.040 --> 54:24.520]  but if you can't even make what you sell it for.
[54:24.520 --> 54:27.320]  Yeah, we have a family friend here that runs a tier three,
[54:27.320 --> 54:29.640]  he's a big producer and you would be impressed
[54:29.640 --> 54:30.480]  with his facility.
[54:30.480 --> 54:33.720]  He's got his cost per pound at 300.
[54:33.720 --> 54:36.720]  He recycles all his nutrients, sits in a hydroponic,
[54:36.720 --> 54:38.360]  so he actually uses no medium.
[54:38.360 --> 54:39.200]  Nice.
[54:39.200 --> 54:41.440]  And so, you know, it cycles through,
[54:41.440 --> 54:45.160]  the computer reevaluates and readjusts the fertilizer.
[54:45.160 --> 54:47.440]  And I mean, so like he can come down quite a bit
[54:47.440 --> 54:48.640]  and still be profitable.
[54:48.640 --> 54:49.480]  Right.
[54:49.480 --> 54:53.680]  And so, I mean, as far as indoor, I think, you know,
[54:53.680 --> 54:55.680]  I mean, $50 a pound is incredible.
[54:55.680 --> 54:56.840]  I mean, only by-
[54:56.840 --> 54:57.960]  Well, it's cause I have no light.
[54:57.960 --> 54:58.800]  That's the biggest thing.
[54:58.800 --> 55:00.840]  I mean, I have limited labor, cause me too,
[55:00.840 --> 55:01.760]  I'm the only one out here.
[55:01.760 --> 55:03.640]  I mean, I run 5,000 square foot greenhouse
[55:03.640 --> 55:05.040]  from seed to harvest.
[55:05.040 --> 55:07.240]  So it's a limiting labor, but then lighting.
[55:07.240 --> 55:10.600]  And that's why I always say, I think indoor gardening
[55:10.600 --> 55:12.680]  is going to kind of fizzle away.
[55:12.680 --> 55:14.800]  They just, it's just too intensive.
[55:14.800 --> 55:16.840]  It's hard to keep up with those prices.
[55:16.840 --> 55:18.360]  Yeah, I think it will be kind of, yeah,
[55:18.360 --> 55:19.920]  cost prohibitive eventually.
[55:19.920 --> 55:22.000]  I mean, there may be niche markets, high-end,
[55:22.000 --> 55:23.720]  connoisseur, like, you know,
[55:23.720 --> 55:25.640]  and that may always be a thing,
[55:25.640 --> 55:27.800]  but I think for the majority, like, yeah,
[55:27.800 --> 55:31.280]  when you can get outdoor, you know, down to $10 a pound,
[55:31.280 --> 55:33.480]  you know, like, you know, with minimal inputs
[55:33.480 --> 55:35.520]  and, you know, cheaper labor.
[55:35.520 --> 55:38.920]  And that's when we start getting into the global market,
[55:38.920 --> 55:41.760]  I think, you know, where you have these, you know,
[55:41.760 --> 55:44.280]  most high labor, like, high labor crops
[55:44.280 --> 55:46.440]  are outsourced to countries with cheaper labor.
[55:46.440 --> 55:50.280]  And so, but we won't see that until you have
[55:50.280 --> 55:54.080]  global legalization and import and export laws.
[55:54.080 --> 55:57.160]  But the same can be said for breeding, you know,
[55:57.160 --> 55:59.480]  like I've done the math and like,
[55:59.480 --> 56:01.120]  if I do greenhouse seed runs, you know,
[56:01.120 --> 56:04.680]  I could be profitable at 10 cents a seed, you know,
[56:04.680 --> 56:06.600]  but I can't sell all that seed.
[56:06.640 --> 56:08.920]  And so I do kind of smaller, you know, like,
[56:08.920 --> 56:12.360]  and I do smaller runs now and, you know, I do variety.
[56:12.360 --> 56:14.640]  And, you know, at the same time, I'm also doing, you know,
[56:14.640 --> 56:17.840]  like doing stuff for like bulk stuff, you know,
[56:17.840 --> 56:21.600]  like bulk varieties that I can do at a cheaper price.
[56:21.600 --> 56:23.480]  But for the most part,
[56:23.480 --> 56:24.920]  I've just been doing smaller seed runs
[56:24.920 --> 56:26.680]  and leaving the greenhouse space open
[56:26.680 --> 56:29.320]  for kind of pheno hunts and selecting,
[56:29.320 --> 56:31.280]  which has, you know, has worked,
[56:32.440 --> 56:34.840]  especially since, you know, like I said, I think,
[56:34.840 --> 56:36.960]  and I think that this can be said for most breeders.
[56:36.960 --> 56:38.200]  I'd be interested to know,
[56:38.200 --> 56:41.160]  but I think most breeders probably make most of their income
[56:41.160 --> 56:44.320]  on cultivating, at least in this market.
[56:45.480 --> 56:46.520]  And so.
[56:46.520 --> 56:47.520]  Yeah.
[56:47.520 --> 56:50.640]  Yeah. And you know, and hemp was kind of in the same boat
[56:50.640 --> 56:52.240]  as far as what I was trying to do.
[56:52.240 --> 56:54.320]  You know, at first I wasn't doing, I wanted to do volume.
[56:54.320 --> 56:58.560]  Cause in 2018, smokeable flower was 900 bucks a pound.
[56:58.560 --> 57:00.160]  Everybody wanted it.
[57:00.160 --> 57:01.280]  Now that's kind of crashed.
[57:01.280 --> 57:04.520]  But yeah, my mentality was, I want to grow bulk.
[57:05.200 --> 57:06.480]  I wanted to deal just wholesale.
[57:06.480 --> 57:10.200]  And so I would go to vendors and like I said, 2018, 19,
[57:10.200 --> 57:12.160]  it was, it was good.
[57:12.160 --> 57:13.400]  But then the last few years, you know,
[57:13.400 --> 57:16.680]  there is no real wholesale market for that kind of
[57:16.680 --> 57:19.400]  intermediate to higher quality flower.
[57:19.400 --> 57:20.800]  So I would show up, say, hey, you know,
[57:20.800 --> 57:22.640]  you guys want 300 pounds at this price?
[57:22.640 --> 57:25.920]  They're like, no, but we'll buy four pounds at a thousand
[57:25.920 --> 57:27.760]  dollars and it's like, wait a second.
[57:27.760 --> 57:31.400]  And so it really created smokeable hemp flower
[57:31.400 --> 57:32.840]  is small niche producers.
[57:32.880 --> 57:36.320]  I was just producing way too much that nobody wanted
[57:36.320 --> 57:38.960]  300 pounds of super sour space candy.
[57:38.960 --> 57:41.920]  And so then you kind of get into some of these other
[57:41.920 --> 57:44.360]  crazier, you know, more unique genetics,
[57:44.360 --> 57:47.160]  but then you run into producing that at large scale
[57:47.160 --> 57:48.760]  because of, you know, what we're talking about,
[57:48.760 --> 57:51.680]  just not having, they weren't, you know, homogenized.
[57:51.680 --> 57:53.560]  I couldn't get those runs out.
[57:53.560 --> 57:56.040]  And so at that point, it's really more beneficial
[57:56.040 --> 58:00.040]  to the small grower that can do 10 plants of each variety
[58:00.040 --> 58:02.200]  and sell them, you know, four or five times
[58:02.840 --> 58:04.120]  as much as I sell my flower.
[58:04.120 --> 58:05.880]  And I think they're doing well.
[58:05.880 --> 58:08.160]  And then especially you get to some of these, you know,
[58:08.160 --> 58:09.080]  companies that are, like I said,
[58:09.080 --> 58:12.240]  are producing some of these THCAs and some Delta 8 sprays.
[58:12.240 --> 58:13.880]  There's so many loopholes that now.
[58:13.880 --> 58:15.600]  I know. And that's, yeah.
[58:15.600 --> 58:19.120]  Selling legit flower, like legit compliant flower.
[58:19.120 --> 58:21.920]  It's a hard, it's a hard business right now.
[58:21.920 --> 58:25.000]  Which it's the same thing that I mentioned with CBG.
[58:25.000 --> 58:26.200]  I think you're seeing a lot of,
[58:26.200 --> 58:28.120]  you're going to see a lot of these farmers try and switch
[58:28.120 --> 58:30.280]  over to THCA flower, which, you know, I mean,
[58:30.280 --> 58:31.960]  that's a whole kind of discussion itself.
[58:32.720 --> 58:34.680]  I don't think I want to go there, but,
[58:34.680 --> 58:37.600]  but then, you know, there's going to be a CBD drought
[58:37.600 --> 58:39.800]  and there are, there's a big consumer base
[58:39.800 --> 58:42.560]  that want high quality, flavorful, you know,
[58:42.560 --> 58:44.640]  properly cured CBD flower.
[58:44.640 --> 58:45.480]  For sure.
[58:45.480 --> 58:47.720]  And I think you're going to see the price come back up.
[58:47.720 --> 58:50.520]  I mean, that's the crazy thing with the marketplace, right?
[58:50.520 --> 58:53.680]  Is like prices drop below a certain threshold
[58:53.680 --> 58:55.440]  and it pushes out a lot of people.
[58:55.440 --> 58:57.320]  And it's like, you have to have a passion
[58:57.320 --> 58:59.200]  for what you're doing in order to stick around.
[58:59.200 --> 59:01.360]  And I think from the breeding perspective too,
[59:01.680 --> 59:03.720]  in order to ride out a recession,
[59:04.760 --> 59:05.960]  you really have to kind of,
[59:05.960 --> 59:08.840]  you have to be as efficient as possible.
[59:08.840 --> 59:11.400]  You have to cut your inputs down as low as you can
[59:11.400 --> 59:14.680]  and still produce a valuable or a quality product.
[59:14.680 --> 59:17.000]  Not, you know, both from the breeding perspective
[59:17.000 --> 59:19.520]  and from, you know, kind of the end product,
[59:19.520 --> 59:21.040]  the flower side of things.
[59:21.040 --> 59:22.840]  And like, and that's kind of one of my goals is like,
[59:22.840 --> 59:26.000]  if I can produce seed for even cheaper or flower,
[59:26.000 --> 59:28.960]  you know, I mean, and like, so I sell my flower,
[59:29.440 --> 59:32.800]  I'd say a little cheaper than most people do
[59:32.800 --> 59:34.960]  because it's, you know, it's their phenol hunt.
[59:34.960 --> 59:38.040]  So it's like, you know, there's some variation,
[59:38.040 --> 59:41.200]  especially when you get into like CBD, CBG hybrids,
[59:41.200 --> 59:43.600]  where even within different plants,
[59:43.600 --> 59:45.160]  the chemotype varies, right?
[59:46.280 --> 59:48.880]  But there, you know, as long as you're transparent
[59:48.880 --> 59:51.160]  and you're not, you know, and your consumer knows
[59:51.160 --> 59:52.800]  that that's what they're buying
[59:52.800 --> 59:55.560]  and the value is priced accordingly,
[59:55.560 --> 59:58.200]  you know, you can be profitable.
[59:58.200 --> 01:00:01.120]  The problem I see, especially with the THC is people,
[01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:02.480]  they're, you know, they're struggling,
[01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:03.800]  especially when times get tough,
[01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:07.040]  you just hop where the money is.
[01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:09.520]  And so it's, you know, you still have to,
[01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:11.840]  but I think you still have to have kind of like
[01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:14.800]  some integrity and some kind of goal in mind,
[01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:16.000]  like, you know,
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.800]  cause that's gonna dry up eventually too, right?
[01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:21.120]  It's like any kind of like once regulation sets in
[01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:23.920]  and like, you know, even within my state,
[01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:27.520]  they're debating in our Senate right now,
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:31.640]  like adding, you know, the CBD content to edibles, right?
[01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:33.120]  Like they wanna limit that.
[01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:34.440]  And it's a big discussion
[01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:36.080]  and you've got the rec guys fighting
[01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:37.760]  against the hemp lobbyists
[01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:41.880]  because the rec guys don't want any THC allowed.
[01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:44.840]  And, you know, so it's, I mean, there's just,
[01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:47.760]  there's so many aspects to this industry
[01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:50.880]  that it's hard to even take like that macro view
[01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:52.920]  or whatever and like stand back
[01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:55.880]  and kind of like look at the bigger picture, but.
[01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:56.720]  Right.
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:01:00.440]  Well, and it's hard to keep the integrity going.
[01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:02.120]  You know, I've, I've could have made a lot more money
[01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:05.520]  in this industry if I, you know, made different decisions,
[01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:07.960]  you know, as far as like I have to jump on Delta A
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:09.480]  when that was first popular,
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:12.000]  I guarantee I could hold crazy amounts of that.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.000]  And then when HHC and all these other things came out
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.600]  and everyone, you know,
[01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:19.400]  you could jump on those and make a lot of money,
[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:20.800]  but it's gonna be a quick investment.
[01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:23.240]  And then, and at least in my mind,
[01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:25.000]  it kind of tarnishes the integrity
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.680]  of that company a little bit, but at the same time,
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:30.520]  I know a lot of hemp farms that have gone out of business.
[01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:32.280]  So if that's their last decision
[01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:34.000]  to keep the family farm running, you know,
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.600]  I can't, I can't hate them for that.
[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:39.880]  It's more of just, yeah, the gray area that we're in.
[01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:44.000]  And cause I have a few THCA genetics that, you know,
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:48.360]  they're type twos, you know, 10% THC, 9% CBD,
[01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:51.280]  0.2 total Delta nine.
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:53.120]  And it's like, and it's great terpenes,
[01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:55.040]  it's like fantastic flower,
[01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:57.120]  but I'm not gonna take the risk to sell it
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:58.920]  and get it out there, you know,
[01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:00.080]  but then you'll see, you know, you go online,
[01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:04.200]  you'll see 29% THCA flower that you could just buy,
[01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:05.520]  have delivered to your door.
[01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:08.400]  And it's like, that's, that's gonna be crazy
[01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:09.320]  if that doesn't get a hold of,
[01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:11.640]  cause that's gonna hurt the traditional rec market.
[01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:14.000]  You can just buy straight up weed online.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:14.840]  Yeah. Yeah.
[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:16.200]  I mean, there's always, right.
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:17.520]  There's always gonna be, you know,
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:20.200]  people are gonna push the boundaries
[01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:21.320]  as much as they can, right?
[01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:24.160]  I mean, honestly, the medical cannabis industry
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:25.560]  was created through a loophole.
[01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:28.360]  Like I ran a, you know, I ran a dispensary
[01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:30.560]  with my brother-in-law for a couple of years.
[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:33.520]  And, you know, it's the way that the laws were written
[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:36.240]  was, you know, everybody, you know, joined the, you know,
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:37.640]  kind of like the collective, right.
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:39.120]  And everything was based on donations.
[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:41.680]  And so like, I think our industry,
[01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:43.920]  who was kind of based on that mindset of like
[01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:47.920]  taking advantage of the loopholes and, you know,
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:49.640]  I don't think there's anything wrong with that.
[01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:53.040]  I think, you know, people deserve access to this plant,
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:55.680]  you know, regardless of the laws.
[01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:57.920]  I mean, I think prohibition has kind of proven that,
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:01.040]  like we're so far behind where we could be,
[01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:02.600]  not only from the medicinal side,
[01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:05.760]  which is I think where I kind of approach things from,
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:07.480]  you know, the recreational side, medicinal,
[01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:10.360]  but then also you look at like everything else
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:13.920]  as far as the industrial, you know, aspect of it,
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:15.920]  like plastics, building material.
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:19.600]  I mean, I come from a, you know, construction background
[01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:22.880]  and it's just mind blowing to see some of these products
[01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:25.520]  that we could have had, you know, decades ago
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:27.760]  and where we would be now.
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:30.040]  So it's, you know, so yeah,
[01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:32.160]  I don't blame people like you said for that.
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:34.920]  I do, you know, when you get into isomers and stuff
[01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:37.840]  and some of the methods that it takes to create those,
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:39.000]  that's kind of where I draw the line.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.360]  I prefer more of a, like the natural cannabinoids,
[01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:43.760]  like something that you're gonna pull from the plant.
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:46.200]  Like even, you know, they do like,
[01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:50.680]  you can get THCV leaders now that are converted from CBDV
[01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:53.440]  and it's like, like molecularly,
[01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:55.400]  I'm sure that it probably is the same,
[01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:57.800]  but is it, you know, I don't know.
[01:03:57.800 --> 01:03:59.960]  So it's just, I mean, that's a whole other argument.
[01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:02.640]  I'm not, I don't have enough experience or knowledge
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:04.680]  to speak on it, you know, but-
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:06.320]  Yeah, because then it goes into the guys
[01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:09.080]  creating cannabinoids from yeast.
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:09.920]  Right, yeah.
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:11.920]  And then we're all out of business.
[01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:14.200]  Yep, yeah, but then, but you all, you know,
[01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:15.040]  it's the same thing.
[01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:16.680]  It's like, why choose organic food
[01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:18.560]  over conventional grown food, right?
[01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:21.680]  It's, you have these people that they understand,
[01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:24.680]  you know, kind of the bigger systems at play
[01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:26.480]  and the fact that kind of, you know,
[01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:30.360]  you know, like obviously the natural way,
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:33.320]  not necessarily is the best, you know, way,
[01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:35.320]  but at least, you know, it's natural, right?
[01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:38.200]  And so like, there's something to be said for, you know,
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:40.920]  and that's why like one of my interests is like minors
[01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:43.480]  and like, you know, breeding for CBDV, THCV
[01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:46.840]  and like, I think eventually they will serve a role
[01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:50.360]  and like what one of the driving factors for me
[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:53.320]  is people that use this plant medicinally,
[01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:55.560]  that make, you know, that can grow a few plants,
[01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:57.920]  make a tincture and ultimately change their life,
[01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:00.880]  whether it's like CBG and like Crohn's and IBS,
[01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:03.240]  like, I mean, a lot of the, you know,
[01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:06.640]  pharmaceuticals eventually lose, you know, effectiveness
[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:08.040]  and then you have this plant,
[01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:09.880]  which it's like a lock and key mechanism.
[01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:14.040]  Like our bodies are designed for cannabinoids, right?
[01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:16.640]  Like we have an entire system.
[01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:19.880]  And so it just makes sense that like potentially
[01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:22.560]  there's all kinds of cures hidden within this plant
[01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:25.400]  and like we are just scratching the surface.
[01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:28.280]  And so as a breeder, that's what piques me at my interest
[01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:29.280]  and what keeps me going.
[01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:32.120]  Because for me, I'm not just breeding for THC
[01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:34.040]  or to get high, it's like, to me,
[01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:37.920]  it's like I have this endless supply of different colors
[01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:39.560]  and tools to draw from.
[01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:41.840]  And I could spend my entire life doing this
[01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:44.240]  and feel like I never got anywhere.
[01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:47.840]  And like the goal is to have IBL lines
[01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:51.520]  for true breeding purposes, to have auto flower lines,
[01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:52.920]  you know, for true breeding.
[01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:56.000]  And it's like, but you gotta start somewhere.
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:59.160]  And so that's kind of where like,
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.400]  you gotta get your boots on the ground.
[01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:02.440]  And like, for somebody like me,
[01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:04.920]  that doesn't necessarily have like a ton of resources,
[01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:07.120]  you're limited, you know, by your canopy
[01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:08.360]  and what you can afford each month.
[01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:10.520]  Like, you know, I run my greenhouses year round.
[01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:12.240]  So propane is a, you know.
[01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:13.200]  Yeah, that's the only reason I'm,
[01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:16.160]  this is the first winter in 10 years I'm not running
[01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:18.080]  just because it's like, yeah, the propane is too much
[01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:20.960]  and time to take a break and do some other things.
[01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:23.240]  But yeah, I mean, I think as you say,
[01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:24.400]  it's something we didn't talk about a little bit
[01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:26.760]  on breeding is there's so many different options.
[01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:28.280]  Like in Canada right now, it's chemotype.
[01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:29.560]  They just want to breed for what's highest.
[01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:33.200]  But I think traditionally breeding had different purposes.
[01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:34.880]  You know, you would go back to Borlaug.
[01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:38.520]  You know, he got put on the map for making dwarf wheat.
[01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:40.680]  So it's breeding plants.
[01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:44.120]  And to me, this gets into the commercial side of things of,
[01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:47.520]  if you can breed a plant that just fits my climate,
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:50.400]  that handles pruning well, that doesn't need trellising,
[01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:54.040]  that is just a beast for growing in production.
[01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:55.360]  As a grower, I want to grow that.
[01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:57.040]  Now, of course, let's perfect that
[01:06:57.040 --> 01:06:59.600]  and create good flavors and terpenes out of it.
[01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:01.040]  But I think there's so much more to breeding
[01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:03.560]  than just who's got the biggest flavor
[01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:04.560]  and the highest content.
[01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:08.040]  And I think in years as the market matures,
[01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:09.440]  we'll start to see some of that.
[01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:11.040]  But yeah, I would love to see, you know,
[01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:13.480]  cannabis strains that work well for hydroponic systems,
[01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:15.360]  cannabis systems that are better for living soil
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:19.240]  or for raft culture or, you know, different setups.
[01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:21.160]  And then you could buy cultivars based on that.
[01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:22.640]  I think that'd be cool.
[01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:24.960]  Yeah, even like, you know, I've been working with,
[01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:26.600]  there's a few like on the West Coast,
[01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:29.560]  it's WSU, OSU and UC Davis.
[01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:31.800]  They all kind of like combine their hemp programs
[01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:33.240]  and their research programs.
[01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:34.720]  And they've been growing some of my feminized
[01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:36.920]  fiber varieties out the past couple of years.
[01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:39.480]  And they want to do kind of like breeding projects
[01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:41.400]  and stuff and they use them for a control group
[01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:44.520]  when doing trials on their, you know,
[01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:46.680]  their other kind of like flower varieties
[01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:49.160]  because there's no pollen flying.
[01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:51.920]  And so they do like irrigation testing and different things.
[01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:55.520]  But, you know, so in many,
[01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:57.280]  and that's the role of the universities, right?
[01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:58.960]  Is like when there is no industry,
[01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:00.760]  it's the universities and the grant money
[01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:03.160]  and the people that with foresight, you know,
[01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:06.960]  for example, I come from, you know, construction
[01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:08.720]  and you have building codes, right?
[01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:09.840]  Well, here in the United States,
[01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:12.680]  we have no building codes that incorporate hemp materials.
[01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:14.480]  Whereas like in the European Union,
[01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:17.720]  they've been using hemp for, you know, decades, right?
[01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:21.360]  So it's like, so we're already way behind
[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:23.200]  and it's like, it takes legislation
[01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:25.680]  and kind of like, you know, the universities
[01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:28.600]  to kind of pull these rules and regulations together.
[01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:31.480]  And so it's just a long process.
[01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:34.920]  And in the meantime, us as, you know,
[01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:36.680]  kind of breeders and producers, like, you know,
[01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:39.480]  we have very little, somewhat oversight,
[01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:40.960]  especially in the end use product.
[01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:42.560]  And I think that's where like THCA
[01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:43.920]  and all that stuff comes in.
[01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:45.640]  Yeah.
[01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:48.480]  Well, I think federal legalization
[01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:50.640]  is gonna change things a lot.
[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:52.840]  So like when I was at Colorado State
[01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:55.960]  and we were doing hemp research there,
[01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:58.960]  it was, I mean, we were glad that they allowed us to do it,
[01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:02.000]  but we were looked on and maybe frowned upon
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:02.840]  by certain people.
[01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:04.040]  And I think they didn't quite know
[01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:05.000]  what they were getting into.
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:06.840]  Cause you get some of the, you know,
[01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:09.840]  the Dean of Ag Culture, they think hemp is fiber.
[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:11.480]  And so they come in three months later
[01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:14.320]  and we have just the whole campus stinks.
[01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:15.480]  There's buds everywhere.
[01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:17.400]  We're transplanting huge colas.
[01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:20.680]  Then they're kind of, we're singing a different tune
[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:23.240]  of like, well, this isn't what we thought it was.
[01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:25.200]  We thought it was gonna be like bamboo stalks.
[01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:27.520]  This is straight up like canvas looking weed.
[01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:30.200]  Like the students are starting to ask questions.
[01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:32.960]  And so we had to really kind of downscale
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:35.400]  and a lot of funding was, you know,
[01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:38.400]  at risk of being lost because other corporations
[01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:41.480]  didn't want to be seen as being part of the cannabis school.
[01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:44.520]  And so there's a lot of those stigmas
[01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:47.680]  that really prevent a lot of widespread research
[01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:48.520]  from happening.
[01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:50.560]  And so we ended up having to shut down our little program
[01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:53.040]  for different reasons, but that had a part of it.
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:55.160]  And so I think once it's federally legal,
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:57.040]  all of a sudden, and the same is gonna go
[01:09:57.560 --> 01:09:59.640]  for these bigger companies, not just academic research,
[01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:01.280]  but for some of these bigger breeding companies
[01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:02.840]  that they're like, all right, you know,
[01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:04.440]  we want to get into cannabis right now,
[01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:06.120]  but we're a huge company.
[01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:08.240]  We can't put our neck out there legally
[01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:09.680]  until it's confirmed, you know,
[01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:11.200]  cause it's still federally legal.
[01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:13.000]  You know, it's legal in states,
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.680]  but federally it's totally legal.
[01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:16.480]  So that's a huge barrier right now
[01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:18.000]  to some of these bigger companies.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.680]  And what that floodgate will look like when it's opened up,
[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:22.400]  you know, I don't know, it could be terrible.
[01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:25.440]  Let me just get this massive nonsense out there,
[01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:26.760]  but I think it at least opens it up
[01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:30.000]  to just get some more of these larger,
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:31.760]  I guess, Oregon CBD type companies
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:34.360]  that have the facilities to do thousands of reps
[01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:36.720]  and have the money to do it for 10 years
[01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:37.880]  and to really produce something.
[01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:41.040]  So I think it'll be weird and kind of interesting
[01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:42.160]  what we see come out of all that,
[01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:44.880]  but I think it'll ultimately end up, you know,
[01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:47.120]  mostly for the better, I guess,
[01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:49.440]  as far as genetics goes, hopefully.
[01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:51.040]  Yeah, it definitely will be interesting.
[01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:55.000]  I've heard like some people say that it's possible
[01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:58.520]  that like the ATF will regulate smokable hemp and cannabis,
[01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:00.680]  you know, and so that they'll roll that together
[01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:03.240]  and then you'll basically have industrial hemp
[01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:05.120]  being regulated by the Department of Ag,
[01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:06.560]  and which that would, you know,
[01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:09.720]  that would basically lump all smokable and consumable,
[01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:11.200]  you know, stuff together,
[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:14.720]  which, I mean, in my eyes, it's all one plant, you know,
[01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:16.160]  I mean, we're talking, you know,
[01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:21.160]  definitions and percentages at the end of the day.
[01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:23.160]  But yeah, that's fascinating.
[01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:24.840]  Because like, I know, I believe it,
[01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:26.760]  what was it, Colorado that found,
[01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:28.520]  like they found the loophole, right?
[01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:32.640]  Because by definition, hemp was like anything under 0.3.
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:34.760]  And technically you can grow hash plants
[01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:36.520]  that are under 0.3, like.
[01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:37.600]  Yeah.
[01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:40.000]  Yeah, I mean, and it really opened, you know,
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.760]  and so the other thing in Colorado
[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:44.680]  is we started getting all of these grow operations,
[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:47.400]  these like these underground kind of clandestine labs
[01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:50.160]  popping up because by definition,
[01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:53.040]  if the cops or feds caught you in veg,
[01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:56.000]  that's hemp because you could test that veg plant at 0.3.
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.640]  And so there's so many of these loopholes
[01:11:57.640 --> 01:11:59.880]  that we're kind of getting taken advantage of.
[01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:02.080]  And then, you know, with the edible side of things
[01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:04.320]  where it's 0.3 by weight.
[01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:06.920]  So you put 10 milligrams in a hundred milligram cookie
[01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:08.280]  and all of a sudden that's legal.
[01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:09.680]  So they're shipping, you know,
[01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:13.160]  fully Delta nine edibles online.
[01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:16.760]  And so, yeah, there's so many different loopholes
[01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:17.600]  and that's why, you know,
[01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:20.680]  I see a lot of breeders kind of focus on, you know,
[01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:23.640]  getting the total THC at 0.3,
[01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:26.720]  but, you know, I've been growing hemp since 2018
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:28.400]  and I've yet to see a plant
[01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:32.160]  that resembles anything anybody wants that 0.3 total THC.
[01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:36.040]  So the whole market is kind of this facade of it's hemp,
[01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:38.200]  but, you know, you decarb everything
[01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:39.640]  and you get total THC values.
[01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:43.040]  None of it's traditionally 0.3%.
[01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:45.360]  And maybe you can speak to that more, but.
[01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:47.040]  Yeah, I mean, that's a huge issue.
[01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:49.560]  You know, I mean, they're like as a hemp farmer,
[01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:51.560]  you know, like I've had a few failed crops, you know,
[01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:53.560]  and had to dispose some stuff and it's like,
[01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:54.760]  it's a fine line.
[01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:56.680]  I mean, the biggest thing is testing early.
[01:12:56.680 --> 01:12:59.440]  You know, as a breeder, like I expect to have some failed
[01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:01.680]  and like I work pretty closely with our ag department,
[01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:03.400]  like, you know, the director and stuff.
[01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:07.840]  So, you know, like I know, you know, what, you know.
[01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:10.080]  And again, it's those loopholes, right?
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:12.480]  You know, it's like 30 days before harvest
[01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:15.680]  and then it's got the sticks and the leaves in it.
[01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:18.560]  But yeah, when that thing is sold in a jar online
[01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:21.720]  or wherever, it's definitely not that same test.
[01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:23.920]  Yeah, I mean, I think a huge thing that, you know,
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:25.920]  that would solve that would be just bumping everything
[01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:26.920]  up to 1%.
[01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:29.640]  Because I'd say 95% of type threes out there
[01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:31.580]  could hit that mark easily.
[01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:33.920]  And then you would just take, you know,
[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:36.360]  that would take all the stress off the farmers.
[01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:40.320]  And yeah, I mean, these farms that are converting to THC,
[01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:42.980]  it's, you know, it's like, I wouldn't recommend it.
[01:13:42.980 --> 01:13:45.480]  I think, you know, testing early on type three
[01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:47.560]  and just growing the best flower you can
[01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:51.320]  and curing it properly is definitely is the way to go.
[01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:54.280]  And you know, like you said, I mean, well, you know,
[01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:57.440]  I mean, genetics are, you know,
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:00.240]  like that is the starting material for every farmer.
[01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:02.080]  So like, it's hard, you know,
[01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:04.400]  you start out with poor genetics, you know,
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:06.400]  you're out the gate at a disadvantage
[01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:07.960]  and you're not gonna have a successful crop.
[01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:12.200]  And so, yeah, I mean, that's kinda, you know,
[01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:13.840]  that and that's, and I see that too.
[01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:16.640]  And so it's like, you know,
[01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:20.160]  like I have even the past year or two have gone away.
[01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:22.480]  Like I don't sell bulk seed really anymore, you know,
[01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:24.560]  and I've kinda gone on the other route
[01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:27.160]  and selling, you know, small batch seed.
[01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:29.040]  And now that I've gotten some, you know,
[01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:30.880]  pretty good lines, I'm ready to kinda do
[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:32.000]  more production stuff.
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:35.080]  And like I said, I mean, there, I can produce seed,
[01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:38.880]  you know, if I do a greenhouse run at a very low cost
[01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:40.440]  versus my indoor seed runs, you know?
[01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:43.600]  And so like, but you kinda have to judge the market
[01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:44.800]  and be like, is it worth it?
[01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:46.480]  You know, is the time right?
[01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:48.760]  And a part of that is like, I realized, you know,
[01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:50.560]  you gotta put in the time in,
[01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:53.400]  guarantee that you're able to produce those stable lines
[01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:55.960]  that, you know, you can sell to farmers.
[01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:58.280]  And in the meantime, I've done, you know,
[01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:01.320]  polyhybrid crosses and sold to smaller farmers
[01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:02.360]  that are willing to do pheno hunt.
[01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:05.840]  So, you know, honestly, the majority of my seed sales
[01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:07.440]  are probably home growers, you know?
[01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:11.920]  I get, so, and so that's kind of where, you know,
[01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:13.920]  but I'm also, yeah, go ahead.
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:16.320]  So your risk to selling to farmers is a lot higher too,
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:17.760]  because they're gonna be a lot more,
[01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:18.720]  like we were talking about earlier,
[01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:21.720]  how the cannabis, the home grower doesn't care.
[01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:22.880]  He'll get a seed and be like,
[01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:24.720]  oh, it could have been me, it could have been,
[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:26.520]  but if you sell a thousand seeds to a farmer
[01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:28.600]  and 10% of them are out of whack,
[01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:30.560]  you're gonna get, you're getting a phone call.
[01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:33.000]  And so, yeah, not having to deal with that
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.520]  is definitely a benefit.
[01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:37.920]  Especially when you're selling to places like in Europe,
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:40.240]  you know, and so I know, I like, I can tell you,
[01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:42.360]  okay, what lines are gonna be compliant?
[01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:44.360]  You know, like I think some states,
[01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:46.440]  some countries are at 0.2,
[01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:48.640]  some other countries are at 0.6, you know?
[01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:51.320]  And so it's like, I can kind of guide them and tell you,
[01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:53.360]  okay, these lines will work for you.
[01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:55.000]  Don't purchase this line, you know,
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.360]  because I know my, you know, my genetics.
[01:15:57.360 --> 01:16:00.960]  And so, so yeah, I mean, I think I have somebody,
[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:03.320]  something for everybody, but like, you know,
[01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:05.520]  nobody's gonna come to me and buy 50,000 seeds
[01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:07.840]  because I just, that's not like, you know,
[01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:12.800]  I think, I think eventually, like maybe the goal, you know,
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:14.720]  like ideally I would just breed
[01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:18.040]  and kind of focus on breeding.
[01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:20.000]  Cause you know, I'm sure you know,
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000]  flower production is a lot of work.
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.520]  And then also I don't wholesale anything.
[01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:25.640]  We sell everything direct.
[01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:29.640]  So it's like, which, you know, by doing so,
[01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:32.560]  we're, you know, we're able to sell, you know,
[01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:34.920]  our flower for five times what we could at wholesale price.
[01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:37.800]  And so it's like, it just justifies the labor
[01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:39.480]  and the extra work.
[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:42.000]  But, but yeah, it is a lot of work, you know?
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:43.520]  And so, but that's what it takes, man.
[01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:46.440]  And if that's what it takes for me to grow like the genetic,
[01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:48.080]  the breeding side of the business,
[01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:50.080]  then I will do that for as long as it takes.
[01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:52.680]  And in the meantime, becoming more efficient,
[01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:54.400]  like, I don't know if you've seen, you know,
[01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:56.640]  like I've, we're converting everything over
[01:16:56.640 --> 01:16:58.440]  to kind of like a raised bed.
[01:16:58.440 --> 01:16:59.280]  Yeah.
[01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:00.120]  Yeah.
[01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:00.960]  I've been seeing that.
[01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:01.800]  Yeah.
[01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:02.640]  Your posts.
[01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:03.480]  Yeah.
[01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:04.300]  And so it's like, you know, like the,
[01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:05.920]  the ability to be able to chop, you know,
[01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:09.720]  and replant in a day or two versus like, okay, empty pot,
[01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:11.560]  you know, like it takes me a week before
[01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:12.680]  to empty all my pots,
[01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:17.640]  which would be like three to 400 plants, refill, replant.
[01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:19.360]  And so streamlining, which, you know,
[01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:21.000]  raised beds do come with their own issues.
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.760]  If you ever are confronted with pests or pathogens,
[01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:27.720]  you know, but at this point I don't bring anything in,
[01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:29.720]  you know, it's like, everything's kind of in house.
[01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:31.920]  And it's like, we've already learned those lessons,
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:33.420]  which is a whole other topic.
[01:17:34.420 --> 01:17:38.460]  And yeah, I mean, yeah, man, I know.
[01:17:38.460 --> 01:17:41.780]  I think, I don't know if we hit everything.
[01:17:41.780 --> 01:17:44.260]  I mean, I think we kind of covered, you know, is.
[01:17:44.260 --> 01:17:45.340]  I had some notes.
[01:17:45.340 --> 01:17:47.300]  I haven't been looking.
[01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:48.140]  Yeah.
[01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:49.140]  I had, I had some notes too.
[01:17:50.980 --> 01:17:51.820]  How about you, Peter?
[01:17:51.820 --> 01:17:52.820]  You got any questions?
[01:17:54.660 --> 01:17:55.980]  If he's still in here.
[01:17:55.980 --> 01:17:56.980]  I'm still here.
[01:17:56.980 --> 01:17:59.960]  I was just queuing up your raised beds.
[01:18:01.420 --> 01:18:02.300]  Oh, there you go.
[01:18:02.300 --> 01:18:04.620]  So that's actually compost though.
[01:18:04.620 --> 01:18:05.460]  Those are raised beds.
[01:18:05.460 --> 01:18:08.100]  So that's one of my breeding rooms in the back of,
[01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:10.380]  I have a third greenhouse that the front half
[01:18:10.380 --> 01:18:11.380]  is used seasonally.
[01:18:11.380 --> 01:18:13.540]  Cause you know, we don't, it's not,
[01:18:13.540 --> 01:18:15.540]  there's no heat or lights in there, but.
[01:18:17.300 --> 01:18:18.540]  So yeah, yeah.
[01:18:18.540 --> 01:18:19.860]  That's the farm.
[01:18:19.860 --> 01:18:21.380]  It's literally, I've been, you know,
[01:18:21.380 --> 01:18:23.780]  I've had to put everything on pause
[01:18:23.780 --> 01:18:25.500]  to start converting everything over,
[01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:27.420]  but I've got one greenhouse that's,
[01:18:27.420 --> 01:18:29.140]  that's been in the back of the house.
[01:18:29.140 --> 01:18:30.260]  And I've been, you know,
[01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:32.940]  but I've got one greenhouse that's getting ready
[01:18:32.940 --> 01:18:36.780]  to go into flower and it's,
[01:18:36.780 --> 01:18:39.380]  so far I couldn't be happier with the outcome.
[01:18:39.380 --> 01:18:41.620]  And you know, this is all reused soil.
[01:18:41.620 --> 01:18:42.780]  That's been sitting on my farm.
[01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:44.500]  Some of it for, you know, a couple of years.
[01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:48.220]  Cause initially I wanted to do, like I said,
[01:18:48.220 --> 01:18:50.180]  I mean, I think you can go both routes, right?
[01:18:50.180 --> 01:18:52.500]  Like you can go, you can cut costs
[01:18:52.500 --> 01:18:55.220]  going completely hydroponic and doing, you know,
[01:18:55.220 --> 01:18:56.260]  minimal inputs that way,
[01:18:56.260 --> 01:19:00.100]  or you can kind of go the organic route and, you know,
[01:19:00.940 --> 01:19:01.780]  but then there's in between,
[01:19:01.780 --> 01:19:03.060]  like I was growing organically
[01:19:03.060 --> 01:19:05.740]  and buying pallets of dry amendments
[01:19:05.740 --> 01:19:08.660]  and bottled, you know, like teas.
[01:19:08.660 --> 01:19:11.260]  And it's like, you know, that's organic,
[01:19:11.260 --> 01:19:13.740]  but it's also, you're spending, you know,
[01:19:13.740 --> 01:19:16.700]  fulvic acid and like, it's just what,
[01:19:16.700 --> 01:19:20.500]  at what point, you know, does it, I don't know.
[01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:21.940]  It doesn't make sense, right?
[01:19:21.940 --> 01:19:22.780]  Yeah.
[01:19:22.780 --> 01:19:25.660]  Well, and I think that defines my whole approach,
[01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:28.420]  you know, 15, 20 years ago when I first started,
[01:19:28.420 --> 01:19:30.420]  you know, I was managing hydro shops
[01:19:30.420 --> 01:19:33.460]  and I would more on the organic standpoint,
[01:19:33.460 --> 01:19:36.180]  I would make my own teas and it was more, it was fun.
[01:19:36.180 --> 01:19:38.460]  You know, it was this kind of cool thing you put together.
[01:19:38.460 --> 01:19:42.260]  But I think as I've, as I've evolved and more experience
[01:19:42.260 --> 01:19:44.500]  and again, catering more towards scaling up
[01:19:44.500 --> 01:19:45.820]  the commercial side of it,
[01:19:45.820 --> 01:19:48.140]  it's more of the mantra is less is more.
[01:19:48.140 --> 01:19:49.860]  Like I don't use any amendments.
[01:19:49.860 --> 01:19:52.260]  I make my own fertilizers from scratch
[01:19:52.260 --> 01:19:54.080]  and I'm not saying it's the best way to do it,
[01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:55.700]  but it's definitely, for me,
[01:19:55.700 --> 01:19:57.340]  it's the most efficient and reliable.
[01:19:57.860 --> 01:20:00.940]  It's something I can do and I can move on to other things.
[01:20:00.940 --> 01:20:02.980]  Whereas I think growing in soil,
[01:20:02.980 --> 01:20:04.500]  it's an art as well as a science.
[01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:07.420]  You really have to be a lot more dialed in
[01:20:07.420 --> 01:20:08.940]  as far as your different inputs
[01:20:08.940 --> 01:20:10.460]  and there's a lot more variables.
[01:20:10.460 --> 01:20:12.020]  So I just kind of eliminate those
[01:20:12.020 --> 01:20:15.860]  and it kind of helps me get to my ultimate goal.
[01:20:15.860 --> 01:20:16.820]  Yeah, no, absolutely.
[01:20:16.820 --> 01:20:17.820]  I mean, I've grown with, you know,
[01:20:17.820 --> 01:20:21.180]  dry mineral salts and cocoa and no other additives
[01:20:21.180 --> 01:20:24.700]  and like you can get great yields and, you know,
[01:20:24.700 --> 01:20:26.140]  a good, you know, good product.
[01:20:26.700 --> 01:20:28.100]  Yeah, I mean, like obviously, yeah,
[01:20:28.100 --> 01:20:30.940]  the organic side of things is, it is a passion
[01:20:30.940 --> 01:20:33.380]  and it just makes everything much more enjoyable.
[01:20:34.860 --> 01:20:37.540]  And so like if I'm out there every day, all day,
[01:20:37.540 --> 01:20:39.060]  and if I can cut my labor down
[01:20:39.060 --> 01:20:41.860]  and just focus on building fertility
[01:20:41.860 --> 01:20:46.100]  and ultimately, you know, seeing the expression of,
[01:20:46.100 --> 01:20:47.940]  you know, cause I mean, when you're breeding too,
[01:20:47.940 --> 01:20:52.100]  I mean, you know, I think a lot of the, you know,
[01:20:52.100 --> 01:20:53.500]  people that I might deal with
[01:20:53.500 --> 01:20:55.620]  are just growing outside and living soil
[01:20:56.100 --> 01:20:57.140]  or, you know, just kind of doing, you know,
[01:20:57.140 --> 01:20:59.380]  but they're not putting much thought into it, right?
[01:20:59.380 --> 01:21:00.620]  I mean, especially if they're,
[01:21:00.620 --> 01:21:02.020]  so you get one chance, right?
[01:21:02.020 --> 01:21:03.060]  It's like your outdoor season,
[01:21:03.060 --> 01:21:05.380]  you're gonna throw some plants out,
[01:21:05.380 --> 01:21:07.980]  which, you know, speaks to like early season varieties,
[01:21:07.980 --> 01:21:08.820]  right?
[01:21:08.820 --> 01:21:10.100]  I mean, I think for outdoor growers,
[01:21:11.620 --> 01:21:13.940]  and I think that is the call.
[01:21:13.940 --> 01:21:15.420]  Auto, like you're seeing it,
[01:21:15.420 --> 01:21:17.380]  especially within the cannabis industry,
[01:21:17.380 --> 01:21:19.220]  the auto flowers take off,
[01:21:19.220 --> 01:21:21.860]  like bulk, feminized production auto flower lines
[01:21:21.860 --> 01:21:23.700]  are potentially the future,
[01:21:23.740 --> 01:21:26.540]  especially for like equatorial countries
[01:21:26.540 --> 01:21:30.660]  that, you know, that can't run kind of photo varieties.
[01:21:30.660 --> 01:21:32.780]  Yeah, or, you know, like with Thomas's Pink Panther,
[01:21:32.780 --> 01:21:34.220]  which is more of a semi-auto,
[01:21:34.220 --> 01:21:35.740]  you know, we ran that,
[01:21:35.740 --> 01:21:37.740]  we worked it with our night interruption
[01:21:37.740 --> 01:21:40.580]  and we flowered in the middle of winter
[01:21:40.580 --> 01:21:42.140]  with no lights and no blackout.
[01:21:42.140 --> 01:21:43.460]  You know, you just work with the genetics,
[01:21:43.460 --> 01:21:45.060]  you work with, you know,
[01:21:45.060 --> 01:21:47.500]  some things within the plant physiology
[01:21:47.500 --> 01:21:49.860]  and, you know, we were able to run a full run
[01:21:49.860 --> 01:21:53.380]  and, you know, without the addition of lighting
[01:21:54.060 --> 01:21:55.300]  and blackout and so yeah,
[01:21:55.300 --> 01:21:56.140]  it's doing things like that
[01:21:56.140 --> 01:21:57.260]  and working with the genetics
[01:21:57.260 --> 01:21:58.500]  and figuring out what works
[01:21:58.500 --> 01:22:01.220]  and what works more efficiently for the farmer
[01:22:01.220 --> 01:22:04.540]  really interests me more so than, you know,
[01:22:04.540 --> 01:22:06.740]  the flavor and the flavors I think are always fun,
[01:22:06.740 --> 01:22:08.460]  but I think I looked a little deeper.
[01:22:08.460 --> 01:22:09.300]  It was like, all right,
[01:22:09.300 --> 01:22:10.820]  what's going to be a plant that just thrives
[01:22:10.820 --> 01:22:12.100]  and then that's your base,
[01:22:12.100 --> 01:22:14.780]  then make that taste good or whatever.
[01:22:14.780 --> 01:22:16.860]  Well, especially if you're growing, you know,
[01:22:16.860 --> 01:22:19.900]  say you're just growing for the resin,
[01:22:19.900 --> 01:22:21.660]  like you're a resin farmer, right?
[01:22:22.180 --> 01:22:23.020]  Like you don't even,
[01:22:23.020 --> 01:22:24.420]  it doesn't even need any terpenes
[01:22:24.420 --> 01:22:26.420]  if it's all going into distillate, you know?
[01:22:26.420 --> 01:22:29.100]  And there is a very, you know,
[01:22:29.100 --> 01:22:31.580]  huge market for like just, you know,
[01:22:31.580 --> 01:22:33.900]  full spectrum distillate or just, you know,
[01:22:33.900 --> 01:22:37.140]  cannabis oil in general for all kinds of products.
[01:22:37.140 --> 01:22:39.940]  And so, I mean, I think even, you know,
[01:22:39.940 --> 01:22:41.100]  like even Oregon CV,
[01:22:41.100 --> 01:22:42.940]  I think they had mentioned that with their like CBG,
[01:22:42.940 --> 01:22:46.140]  the fact that the resin wouldn't gum up a combine, right?
[01:22:46.140 --> 01:22:48.660]  And then potentially you could take that CBG
[01:22:48.660 --> 01:22:50.620]  and it's the precursor and what, you know,
[01:22:50.620 --> 01:22:53.260]  if you had an easy method of converting it to CBD
[01:22:53.260 --> 01:22:57.420]  or THC in the lab, you, all you need is to farm CBG.
[01:22:57.420 --> 01:22:58.260]  Yeah.
[01:22:58.260 --> 01:22:59.100]  Yeah.
[01:22:59.100 --> 01:22:59.920]  And that's smart breeding too,
[01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:03.260]  because I've seen CBD gum up combines and it's,
[01:23:03.260 --> 01:23:04.500]  it's not, it's not fun.
[01:23:04.500 --> 01:23:05.500]  So yeah, it's something like that.
[01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:07.980]  It's like, that's a really cool novel approach
[01:23:07.980 --> 01:23:08.820]  that breeding, you know,
[01:23:08.820 --> 01:23:10.980]  has so much power to create something more
[01:23:10.980 --> 01:23:12.860]  than just cool crosses.
[01:23:12.860 --> 01:23:14.820]  I mean, it is cool cross, but you know,
[01:23:14.820 --> 01:23:16.580]  other than chemotype.
[01:23:16.580 --> 01:23:18.060]  Yeah. And I've talked to extractors too.
[01:23:18.060 --> 01:23:20.340]  And it's like, obviously it would be easy
[01:23:21.060 --> 01:23:23.420]  just to have your target cannabinoid prevalent
[01:23:23.420 --> 01:23:26.560]  and copious amounts in your genetics versus taking in,
[01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:28.020]  you know, cause yeah, you could grow CBG
[01:23:28.020 --> 01:23:30.980]  if it was, if that made the most sense harvest wise
[01:23:30.980 --> 01:23:31.820]  and whatnot.
[01:23:31.820 --> 01:23:34.260]  But as far as like THCB or CBD,
[01:23:34.260 --> 01:23:35.840]  like rather than converting it,
[01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:37.900]  it would just make sense to harvest and process, right?
[01:23:37.900 --> 01:23:40.180]  Like the more steps that you can cut out the better.
[01:23:40.180 --> 01:23:41.660]  And so I think there's different approaches
[01:23:41.660 --> 01:23:43.500]  and we're going to see that evolve.
[01:23:43.500 --> 01:23:46.020]  Like I know even within fiber, like we don't,
[01:23:46.020 --> 01:23:48.660]  we don't really have maybe like the equipment available
[01:23:48.660 --> 01:23:50.900]  in the United States to harvest some of the, you know,
[01:23:50.900 --> 01:23:54.300]  really hardy fiber stocks, you know?
[01:23:54.300 --> 01:23:57.940]  So we're so far behind and I think there's,
[01:23:57.940 --> 01:24:01.220]  that's where there's a lot of room for breeders,
[01:24:01.220 --> 01:24:03.540]  both on the academic side from the home grower
[01:24:03.540 --> 01:24:05.420]  and then anybody with a passion.
[01:24:05.420 --> 01:24:08.100]  I think if you're just trying to copy
[01:24:08.100 --> 01:24:10.000]  what's already out there or like trying to,
[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.760]  like you said, chase the next hype, like you, you know,
[01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:14.660]  you can potentially, you can do that,
[01:24:14.660 --> 01:24:18.780]  but eventually I think people lose interest in something,
[01:24:18.780 --> 01:24:21.660]  you know, and that's where.
[01:24:21.660 --> 01:24:23.380]  Yeah, because they'll leave you just like
[01:24:23.380 --> 01:24:25.160]  they left the last breeder to come on.
[01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:26.940]  Oh, he's doing this now, cool.
[01:24:26.940 --> 01:24:29.380]  There's no loyalty in those hype strains.
[01:24:29.380 --> 01:24:30.260]  No, no.
[01:24:30.260 --> 01:24:32.860]  And it's, you know, yeah, there's not,
[01:24:32.860 --> 01:24:34.580]  and there's no novelty in it either, right?
[01:24:34.580 --> 01:24:37.020]  Like, like you said, like anybody can pick up
[01:24:37.020 --> 01:24:38.460]  a couple of clones and smash them together
[01:24:38.460 --> 01:24:40.380]  and you can get good flower that'll yield great
[01:24:40.380 --> 01:24:42.740]  and will be pretty and smells nice and stuff.
[01:24:42.740 --> 01:24:47.580]  But, you know, over time, the stuff that really stands out
[01:24:47.580 --> 01:24:48.820]  and I think, you know, it's a testament
[01:24:48.820 --> 01:24:50.340]  some of the clones that have stuck around for,
[01:24:50.340 --> 01:24:53.720]  it's like, is effect is probably my number one,
[01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:55.520]  you know, like when you're breeding,
[01:24:56.540 --> 01:25:01.540]  even within the hemp realm, like CBD, CBG mixed ratios
[01:25:01.740 --> 01:25:04.820]  can get you kind of stones and they can be compliant,
[01:25:04.820 --> 01:25:08.180]  you know, like even just mixing the two.
[01:25:09.020 --> 01:25:10.620]  And then the fact that like CBDV
[01:25:10.820 --> 01:25:14.100]  is a compliant cannabinoid, THCV is technically compliant
[01:25:14.100 --> 01:25:16.020]  if it has compliant THC levels.
[01:25:16.020 --> 01:25:18.500]  And so I think there is, you know, which are, you know,
[01:25:18.500 --> 01:25:22.500]  have, I mean, anecdotal, you know, kind of efficacy
[01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:25.220]  for like dieting or like maybe quitting smoking.
[01:25:25.220 --> 01:25:27.620]  And so I think there's like, and I mean,
[01:25:27.620 --> 01:25:29.180]  so that's the cool point.
[01:25:29.180 --> 01:25:30.600]  That's the cool part about cannabis is like,
[01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:33.780]  I see that like large scale commercial aspect
[01:25:33.780 --> 01:25:34.820]  and like, I already know breeders
[01:25:34.820 --> 01:25:36.460]  are gonna handle that side.
[01:25:36.860 --> 01:25:40.340]  My interest is like, okay, getting, you know,
[01:25:40.340 --> 01:25:42.940]  these minors and novel cannabinoids out to people
[01:25:42.940 --> 01:25:44.940]  that can grow them and use them as medicine,
[01:25:44.940 --> 01:25:46.860]  getting, you know, which, you know,
[01:25:46.860 --> 01:25:49.500]  cause like I scoured the internet and like, you know,
[01:25:49.500 --> 01:25:51.940]  last year I ran through like five or six different
[01:25:51.940 --> 01:25:54.100]  one-to-one THCV varieties, right?
[01:25:54.100 --> 01:25:55.700]  You know, and it was like basically anything
[01:25:55.700 --> 01:25:58.480]  that was available on the market.
[01:25:59.460 --> 01:26:03.000]  And like, I think one of them, like, I mean,
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.420]  one of them was completely outstanding.
[01:26:04.420 --> 01:26:06.740]  It was a tie and it was my favorite by far,
[01:26:06.740 --> 01:26:09.600]  but they all, you know, had, you know, differences.
[01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:11.220]  Some had, you know, pros and cons.
[01:26:11.220 --> 01:26:16.220]  And so it's like, but then again, like I don't personally
[01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:18.620]  as a consumer, like a one-to-one THCV
[01:26:18.620 --> 01:26:21.500]  because it kind of cancels out any kind of psychoactive
[01:26:21.500 --> 01:26:22.820]  effect that the THC has.
[01:26:22.820 --> 01:26:23.920]  And I think I've said this before.
[01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:25.880]  It's like, it does feel a little bit more
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:30.020]  like a very energetic hemp, you know, CBD or something.
[01:26:30.020 --> 01:26:33.180]  But if you can get that THCV as a minor with some kind,
[01:26:33.580 --> 01:26:37.260]  and get your THCV levels up to 15, 20%,
[01:26:37.260 --> 01:26:40.020]  you have a very kind of energetic, enjoyable effect
[01:26:40.020 --> 01:26:43.740]  that could be not just, you know, like good for daytime use,
[01:26:43.740 --> 01:26:46.580]  but also medicinal for people that need it.
[01:26:46.580 --> 01:26:49.700]  And so like, I'm just, I try and be as well-rounded
[01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:51.320]  as I possibly can and approach things
[01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:53.740]  from like multiple perspectives.
[01:26:54.780 --> 01:26:56.740]  And that's kind of the way I approach, you know,
[01:26:56.740 --> 01:27:00.520]  versus like, I think there is advantages of a breeder
[01:27:00.520 --> 01:27:02.300]  being like super narrow focus.
[01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:04.620]  Like I'm gonna take this one line
[01:27:04.620 --> 01:27:06.180]  and I'm just gonna focus on this one.
[01:27:06.180 --> 01:27:08.140]  And you see there's breeders out there
[01:27:08.140 --> 01:27:10.180]  that have just three solid varieties
[01:27:10.180 --> 01:27:11.300]  and they're doing just fine.
[01:27:11.300 --> 01:27:13.400]  Like they, there is, you know,
[01:27:14.620 --> 01:27:17.260]  and so, and I imagine like there's things
[01:27:17.260 --> 01:27:19.800]  that like I'll never reproduce or that don't interest me
[01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:21.180]  and they'll just fall by the wayside.
[01:27:21.180 --> 01:27:23.240]  And it's like, if you bought them, you bought them
[01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:24.380]  and you'll never see them again.
[01:27:24.380 --> 01:27:26.780]  And then there's other things that will potentially turn
[01:27:26.780 --> 01:27:28.340]  into true breeding lines and you'll see-
[01:27:28.340 --> 01:27:30.340]  Or you hold onto those and then you auction them
[01:27:30.340 --> 01:27:33.940]  for thousands of dollars in a few years.
[01:27:33.940 --> 01:27:36.540]  Yeah, if you have the name and the clout to do so,
[01:27:36.540 --> 01:27:39.540]  which is, you know, which is silly in and of itself.
[01:27:39.540 --> 01:27:43.060]  I think, like you said, there's advantages to Instagram
[01:27:43.060 --> 01:27:47.380]  and that like, you know, and I've learned this myself.
[01:27:47.380 --> 01:27:50.660]  Like if you're not posting, you don't exist almost, right?
[01:27:50.660 --> 01:27:51.500]  You know, it's like-
[01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:52.700]  And you have to post constantly.
[01:27:52.700 --> 01:27:54.380]  You know, there was a time where I was definitely
[01:27:54.380 --> 01:27:56.460]  more engaged than I am now.
[01:27:56.460 --> 01:27:59.700]  And I kind of gave up on for a while trying
[01:27:59.700 --> 01:28:00.540]  to figure out what else.
[01:28:00.540 --> 01:28:01.360]  But yeah, that's the thing.
[01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:03.860]  It's you gotta be relevant and in order to be relevant,
[01:28:03.860 --> 01:28:06.420]  you have to produce what they want to see.
[01:28:06.420 --> 01:28:08.900]  And so, yeah, you kind of have to pander
[01:28:08.900 --> 01:28:10.900]  to that a little bit.
[01:28:10.900 --> 01:28:13.900]  But that's why I always try to keep my page somewhat,
[01:28:13.900 --> 01:28:16.780]  a mix of education, but also kind of poking
[01:28:16.780 --> 01:28:19.220]  at some of these ideas that are just common knowledge
[01:28:19.220 --> 01:28:21.820]  out there and whether or not I agree with it or not,
[01:28:21.820 --> 01:28:24.060]  just bring more discussion, kind of like this topic,
[01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:28.100]  of what is breeding and there's no right or wrong.
[01:28:28.100 --> 01:28:30.140]  It's just get everybody on the same page
[01:28:30.140 --> 01:28:32.820]  of there's different levels of breeding
[01:28:32.820 --> 01:28:34.820]  and it's no disrespect at any tier.
[01:28:34.820 --> 01:28:36.500]  It's just, there's different levels to it.
[01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:39.160]  And each of those levels creates different outcomes
[01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:40.700]  for different groups of people.
[01:28:41.540 --> 01:28:43.100]  And I think, and that's important
[01:28:43.100 --> 01:28:46.180]  because I think you bring a reality to the subject
[01:28:46.180 --> 01:28:50.900]  as far as like, you know, as like states come online, right?
[01:28:50.900 --> 01:28:53.020]  And they're able to legally grow
[01:28:53.020 --> 01:28:55.460]  and you see these breeders, you know, kind of pop up
[01:28:55.460 --> 01:28:57.540]  and it take a stab at it, you know,
[01:28:57.540 --> 01:29:00.820]  and potentially, you know, maybe they have the goal
[01:29:00.820 --> 01:29:03.660]  of like doing it, you know, for a living or whatnot.
[01:29:03.660 --> 01:29:05.860]  But you also have to bring them, you know,
[01:29:05.860 --> 01:29:07.260]  back to reality a little bit and say,
[01:29:07.260 --> 01:29:08.620]  like, I mean, there is a lot of hurdles.
[01:29:08.620 --> 01:29:09.640]  There are barriers to entry.
[01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:11.220]  Like it is easy to make seed.
[01:29:11.220 --> 01:29:12.600]  So that's unquestionable.
[01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:14.300]  Like anybody can do that.
[01:29:14.300 --> 01:29:16.620]  But if you want to do it for a living
[01:29:16.620 --> 01:29:17.940]  and have a product that, you know,
[01:29:17.940 --> 01:29:19.660]  like that you can stand behind,
[01:29:19.660 --> 01:29:21.620]  that you're the farmers can stand behind
[01:29:21.620 --> 01:29:25.780]  or whoever's going to end up with that seed.
[01:29:25.780 --> 01:29:28.240]  I mean, cause you ultimately want return customers.
[01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:30.900]  You want people to enjoy the product and you want to get,
[01:29:30.900 --> 01:29:32.940]  you know, you kind of want to capture their interest
[01:29:32.940 --> 01:29:35.900]  in what you're working on so that they, you know,
[01:29:35.900 --> 01:29:38.500]  kind of follow along and keep up to date.
[01:29:38.500 --> 01:29:40.120]  And it doesn't happen overnight.
[01:29:40.120 --> 01:29:44.300]  You know, I think even people like cookies,
[01:29:44.300 --> 01:29:45.940]  like you don't take into account,
[01:29:45.940 --> 01:29:49.340]  like maybe the decades or years that they struggled
[01:29:49.340 --> 01:29:51.020]  and kind of had to put in the time.
[01:29:51.460 --> 01:29:52.820]  And it's like, yeah, they're where they're at,
[01:29:52.820 --> 01:29:56.180]  you know, for a reason or anybody, you know,
[01:29:56.180 --> 01:29:58.340]  like I kind of like, there's quite a few breeders here
[01:29:58.340 --> 01:30:01.360]  in my state, Washington state and like exotic genetics,
[01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:03.420]  Mike, you know, like I used to,
[01:30:03.420 --> 01:30:05.060]  I used to shop at the same kind of growth store
[01:30:05.060 --> 01:30:06.500]  and he used to be known as Cadillac Mike
[01:30:06.500 --> 01:30:08.820]  and now he drives a Lamborghini, right?
[01:30:08.820 --> 01:30:10.740]  It's like, but you know, he's an OG.
[01:30:10.740 --> 01:30:12.540]  Like he's probably been growing for decades
[01:30:12.540 --> 01:30:15.680]  and it's like, it just, nothing happens overnight.
[01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:19.380]  And it takes time for you to get your genetics out there.
[01:30:19.380 --> 01:30:22.580]  And for like me, like I don't have a marketing team.
[01:30:22.580 --> 01:30:24.500]  I don't, you know, like my marketing is Instagram
[01:30:24.500 --> 01:30:26.980]  and I didn't even have Instagram before I started breeding.
[01:30:26.980 --> 01:30:28.820]  You know, like I, and like, I think Peter,
[01:30:28.820 --> 01:30:30.740]  Peter knows how bad I am at technology.
[01:30:30.740 --> 01:30:35.380]  So, you know, but I, but it goes back.
[01:30:35.380 --> 01:30:37.020]  It's like, if you produce a good product
[01:30:37.020 --> 01:30:39.500]  and you're honest and you're transparent.
[01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:41.860]  And I think if you can, you know,
[01:30:41.860 --> 01:30:43.740]  and the same goes for you, like it's, you know,
[01:30:43.740 --> 01:30:46.020]  you show your grow, you show your processes,
[01:30:46.020 --> 01:30:49.020]  you raise issues where, you know, like, you know,
[01:30:49.780 --> 01:30:51.820]  where bro science might kind of chime in.
[01:30:51.820 --> 01:30:54.380]  And so I like, that's why I've always like,
[01:30:54.380 --> 01:30:55.660]  that's why I kind of, you know,
[01:30:55.660 --> 01:30:56.900]  I wanted you to get on here because like,
[01:30:56.900 --> 01:30:58.540]  I don't want to have a conversation with somebody
[01:30:58.540 --> 01:31:00.300]  that I agree with everything on, you know?
[01:31:00.300 --> 01:31:03.900]  Like I want to offer different perspectives.
[01:31:03.900 --> 01:31:05.900]  And honestly, this is like, yeah,
[01:31:05.900 --> 01:31:07.500]  it's a way for also like discussions
[01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:08.900]  of what kind of hash out your own views.
[01:31:08.900 --> 01:31:10.980]  Like sometimes you don't necessarily know
[01:31:10.980 --> 01:31:12.940]  what you think of something
[01:31:12.940 --> 01:31:14.740]  until you start talking about it, so.
[01:31:14.740 --> 01:31:16.700]  Yeah, no, absolutely.
[01:31:16.700 --> 01:31:17.540]  Yeah, and it's been fun.
[01:31:17.540 --> 01:31:19.620]  And you know, for me, like breeding is always,
[01:31:19.620 --> 01:31:22.140]  I enjoy it as just a fun, like I said earlier,
[01:31:22.140 --> 01:31:24.340]  I'll take some plants, but then I always,
[01:31:24.340 --> 01:31:26.540]  so I'm sitting on a few cultivars that it's like,
[01:31:26.540 --> 01:31:28.540]  oh, these are really cool, but it's like,
[01:31:28.540 --> 01:31:31.540]  I can't sell these, like I'm not a breeder,
[01:31:31.540 --> 01:31:33.500]  but then I'm like, but I have thousands
[01:31:33.500 --> 01:31:34.980]  of these plants or seeds.
[01:31:34.980 --> 01:31:36.820]  I want other people to try it.
[01:31:36.820 --> 01:31:38.300]  So, I mean, I think there's like two
[01:31:38.300 --> 01:31:40.540]  that I have on my site that, yeah.
[01:31:40.540 --> 01:31:42.860]  And it's more of like, you know,
[01:31:42.860 --> 01:31:44.260]  and there's almost like a disclaimer on them.
[01:31:44.260 --> 01:31:46.180]  I mean, like, I'm not going to promise anything with these.
[01:31:46.180 --> 01:31:47.500]  It's just, this is the lineage.
[01:31:48.340 --> 01:31:49.700]  And some of them took me a few years of, you know,
[01:31:49.700 --> 01:31:51.820]  hunting out and it's more like,
[01:31:51.820 --> 01:31:53.780]  I've gotten some really cool results
[01:31:53.780 --> 01:31:56.780]  and you want to share that with other people.
[01:31:56.780 --> 01:31:59.620]  But then it's like, am I falling into that same pit of,
[01:31:59.620 --> 01:32:01.220]  I'm just a guy smashing plants together and say,
[01:32:01.220 --> 01:32:02.540]  here, try these seeds.
[01:32:02.540 --> 01:32:06.100]  And so, and yeah, I don't know where that lies
[01:32:06.100 --> 01:32:08.460]  with other breeders and kind of the idea of that,
[01:32:08.460 --> 01:32:11.420]  but it's, yeah, it's just an interesting,
[01:32:11.420 --> 01:32:13.260]  and I think breeding is so in depth
[01:32:13.260 --> 01:32:15.660]  on many different facets, but I think anybody
[01:32:15.700 --> 01:32:18.420]  that can make something cool,
[01:32:18.420 --> 01:32:20.100]  it's an opportunity for somebody else
[01:32:20.100 --> 01:32:21.860]  to maybe dig through it.
[01:32:21.860 --> 01:32:24.020]  Yeah, dude, I honestly, I want to sell yourself short, man.
[01:32:24.020 --> 01:32:25.580]  I think that's great that you have, you know,
[01:32:25.580 --> 01:32:27.260]  I didn't even realize that you had a couple of crosses
[01:32:27.260 --> 01:32:29.300]  up there, but like, you know, you have the platform,
[01:32:29.300 --> 01:32:31.300]  you have the knowledge, you know what you're doing.
[01:32:31.300 --> 01:32:33.420]  And it's like, you know, you're not going to sell something
[01:32:33.420 --> 01:32:36.140]  that's like, you know, geared towards flower
[01:32:36.140 --> 01:32:38.220]  that might as a fiber variety, or you're not, you know,
[01:32:38.220 --> 01:32:41.740]  like if you knew it had intersex issues, like I, you know,
[01:32:41.740 --> 01:32:44.740]  so you have that kind of like integrity already built
[01:32:44.740 --> 01:32:48.660]  within your, you know, because I mean, you were, you know,
[01:32:48.660 --> 01:32:51.460]  you're a hemp producer, you've been doing that for years,
[01:32:51.460 --> 01:32:54.380]  like you've grown out, you know, countless plants,
[01:32:54.380 --> 01:32:56.820]  like, and that's, so I think just judging
[01:32:56.820 --> 01:32:59.900]  from where your background is, you already have kind of
[01:32:59.900 --> 01:33:03.860]  the, you know, the, what are credentials in some way
[01:33:03.860 --> 01:33:06.460]  to be like, okay, these may not be, you know,
[01:33:06.460 --> 01:33:07.740]  they're, I want to grow, you know,
[01:33:07.740 --> 01:33:09.220]  or if they're male, female, it's, you know,
[01:33:09.220 --> 01:33:10.540]  I mean, obviously a production farm
[01:33:10.540 --> 01:33:12.460]  is not going to grow a male, female variety.
[01:33:12.460 --> 01:33:13.660]  Right, right.
[01:33:13.660 --> 01:33:15.780]  Yeah, and a lot of these are the type twos,
[01:33:15.780 --> 01:33:16.660]  because that's what I've been chasing.
[01:33:16.660 --> 01:33:17.900]  So it's like, oh man, I'm going to share
[01:33:17.900 --> 01:33:19.420]  some of these out there and,
[01:33:19.420 --> 01:33:21.900]  and you know, we'll see what people are doing.
[01:33:21.900 --> 01:33:22.980]  Dude, there's not enough.
[01:33:22.980 --> 01:33:26.460]  Go on to most THC seed banks and try and look for type twos.
[01:33:26.460 --> 01:33:27.300]  Right.
[01:33:27.300 --> 01:33:28.140]  You know what I mean?
[01:33:28.140 --> 01:33:30.180]  So it's like, so you're like, in that regard,
[01:33:30.180 --> 01:33:31.740]  like you're doing a service, you know,
[01:33:31.740 --> 01:33:34.700]  because it's like not enough people are smashing together.
[01:33:34.700 --> 01:33:37.860]  And I mean, that's ultimately how you get new CBD varieties.
[01:33:37.860 --> 01:33:40.420]  You know, that's ultimately how, you know, it's like, so.
[01:33:40.420 --> 01:33:41.260]  Yeah.
[01:33:41.260 --> 01:33:42.080]  And that was my end goal,
[01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:42.920]  and I think I touched on that earlier.
[01:33:43.240 --> 01:33:45.280]  I just find these type twos that work well.
[01:33:45.280 --> 01:33:47.280]  I'm just breeding it to get a handful of seeds
[01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:49.960]  and I'm storing them so that eventually you guys like you
[01:33:49.960 --> 01:33:51.360]  or Thomas or somebody else that says,
[01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:53.560]  hey, we're looking for some of these stocks.
[01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:54.960]  Then at that point, I'm like, yeah, try these.
[01:33:54.960 --> 01:33:56.240]  This could be cool.
[01:33:56.240 --> 01:33:57.760]  And it could turn into something
[01:33:57.760 --> 01:33:59.240]  beyond where I'm willing to take it.
[01:33:59.240 --> 01:34:00.680]  But in the meantime, you know,
[01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:03.000]  I get males and I have thousands of females.
[01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.680]  It's fun to put something together.
[01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:08.440]  Did I trade, I trade seed with, with, with breeders,
[01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:10.000]  like home growers all the time,
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:11.120]  like even from around the world.
[01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:13.840]  Like I traded a dude in Nigeria a couple of years ago
[01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:16.320]  for some, some Nigerians that, you know, it's like.
[01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:17.440]  That's cool.
[01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:19.960]  And, or India or, you know, it's like Thailand.
[01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:22.360]  It's, you know, you just, you meet these people on online
[01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:24.200]  and it's like halfway across the world.
[01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:26.560]  Like what other time in history could we do this?
[01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:28.020]  And they're, they're not, you know,
[01:34:28.020 --> 01:34:29.520]  they're not commercially breeding.
[01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:31.480]  They just have access to, you know,
[01:34:31.480 --> 01:34:33.580]  unique gene pools that I wouldn't.
[01:34:33.580 --> 01:34:36.040]  And so it's like, and I, and same for me, you know,
[01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:37.700]  it's like, I'm a collector and a reader.
[01:34:37.700 --> 01:34:38.920]  And so it's like, I've got something
[01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:40.920]  that most people might be interested in.
[01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:43.320]  And so, you know, that, and that's,
[01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:47.720]  and that's where it's like your hobby joins your career
[01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:48.540]  in some way.
[01:34:48.540 --> 01:34:50.160]  Like if you can, if you can do what you love
[01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:53.680]  and make a living at it, I think that's everybody's dream.
[01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:56.760]  And it's like, it's not like, you know, like I,
[01:34:56.760 --> 01:34:59.320]  it goes back to the kind of like a opportunity cost.
[01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:01.520]  It's like, what is the next best alternative?
[01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:03.200]  Like I have, you know, like I have a master's degree.
[01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:05.080]  I could go, you know, I can go back and get my PhD.
[01:35:05.080 --> 01:35:07.520]  I could go get a job doing something else and work,
[01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:10.280]  you know, maybe 40 hours a week or less.
[01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:11.160]  I don't want to do that.
[01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:12.720]  Like, this is what I chose to do.
[01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:15.640]  Like I work from home, I get to see my kids,
[01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:16.760]  get to put them to bed, you know,
[01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:18.720]  and it's like, I got to work on the weekends,
[01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:20.640]  maybe take a vacation once a year.
[01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:23.400]  But it's, but I, but if you're doing something you enjoy
[01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:25.680]  and you're out with your plants, I mean, that's,
[01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:29.680]  and I think most cannabis breeders, cultivators
[01:35:29.680 --> 01:35:31.240]  might say the same thing, you know,
[01:35:31.240 --> 01:35:33.040]  the people that are in it for the long,
[01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:34.240]  in it for the longterm.
[01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:37.120]  And that's, and that's where you get into,
[01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:39.080]  this is like, you know, people are passionate
[01:35:39.080 --> 01:35:43.120]  about tomatoes and they're passionate about other crops,
[01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:44.960]  whether they're blueberry farmer or something,
[01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:47.520]  but cannabis is just another realm, man.
[01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:50.160]  It's like people have a spiritual connection to this.
[01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:53.680]  They have people that, you know, it's cured their cancer.
[01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:56.560]  It might have a, you know, they just,
[01:35:56.560 --> 01:35:58.840]  people have different relationships with this plant.
[01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:03.120]  And when you develop that relationship to the point
[01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:06.360]  where like, you're not happy if you're not cultivating
[01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:07.800]  or something, it's like, you know,
[01:36:07.800 --> 01:36:10.280]  you're gonna find whatever it takes to do it, you know?
[01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:11.120]  So.
[01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:11.960]  Yeah, no, and it's funny you say that,
[01:36:11.960 --> 01:36:13.400]  because, you know, I've said that before.
[01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:15.080]  It's like, there's gardeners out there
[01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:16.800]  that really love gardening and stuff,
[01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:18.840]  but they're not like wearing gardening shirts
[01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:20.480]  and listening to gardening music.
[01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:24.240]  And, you know, it's, yeah, it's a culture that's really,
[01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:25.560]  and it's not even, you know, some could say,
[01:36:25.560 --> 01:36:27.120]  well, it's the intoxicating side of it
[01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:28.520]  that's kind of drawing them, but it's like,
[01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:31.280]  even, you know, your beer connoisseurs,
[01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:34.000]  I don't think go to the extremes of cannabis guys.
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.200]  It's, so yeah, which can be good.
[01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:37.920]  And then it could be bad.
[01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:39.640]  Sometimes you get passion with, you know,
[01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:41.480]  misrepresentation of knowledge or something.
[01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:42.680]  You get a lot of heads butting, I think,
[01:36:42.680 --> 01:36:44.640]  in this industry and a lot of egos,
[01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:47.800]  but for the most part, yeah, it's a pretty cool
[01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:52.680]  kind of conglomeration of passion, which is cool.
[01:36:52.680 --> 01:36:54.760]  Yeah, and that's where it's like,
[01:36:54.760 --> 01:36:56.080]  it's an endless discussion.
[01:36:56.080 --> 01:36:57.360]  You could ask that question, like,
[01:36:57.360 --> 01:36:58.960]  so is cannabis breeding too easy?
[01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:00.560]  To like a hundred different people,
[01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:01.960]  and you're gonna get a hundred different answers.
[01:37:01.960 --> 01:37:05.600]  And I think even this conversation will, you know,
[01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:07.000]  it'll probably angry some people
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.360]  and maybe it'll open some people up to some different ideas.
[01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:13.440]  And yeah, dude, I think, you know,
[01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:16.040]  I don't think there's a right or wrong answer to it.
[01:37:16.040 --> 01:37:18.240]  I mean, there's a million different approaches
[01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:23.000]  and there's so much room too for new breeders
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.160]  with different approaches.
[01:37:25.160 --> 01:37:28.280]  Like a new thing, like that I just have learned about
[01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:29.640]  within the last maybe year or two
[01:37:29.640 --> 01:37:32.720]  is the leaf mutations, right?
[01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:35.080]  So, you know, you've got like ducks foot,
[01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:37.400]  Australian bastard cannabis,
[01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:40.280]  you've got the pinnate type of fern leaves.
[01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:42.080]  Freakies or I think something, I see.
[01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:42.920]  Yeah, the freak.
[01:37:42.920 --> 01:37:45.640]  So it's like, it's almost like in some sense,
[01:37:45.640 --> 01:37:47.760]  it's an ornamental cannabis, right?
[01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:50.240]  But you can also consume it, but it's like, it looks cool.
[01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:54.240]  And so like, if you have a novel approach
[01:37:54.240 --> 01:37:58.080]  and you, you know, it's like there's room.
[01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:00.920]  I think that's the ticket is like finding something
[01:38:00.920 --> 01:38:04.880]  that you're interested in and trying to pave a new path.
[01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:09.880]  And yeah, so, but yeah, man.
[01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:13.440]  Have we talked long enough?
[01:38:13.440 --> 01:38:14.520]  Yeah, I know.
[01:38:14.520 --> 01:38:15.360]  Hi.
[01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:16.960]  I got a.
[01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:19.600]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:21.920]  Oh, I was gonna say, yeah, the sun's finally out.
[01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:23.240]  Everything was frozen this morning.
[01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:25.680]  So I couldn't like, I couldn't do, move compost,
[01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:26.520]  soil, nothing.
[01:38:26.520 --> 01:38:28.480]  So this actually worked out.
[01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:33.360]  Yeah, we have a bunch of questions
[01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:36.520]  and I was gonna throw some more gas on the fire with this one.
[01:38:37.480 --> 01:38:38.880]  Oh no.
[01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:39.720]  Shoot.
[01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:41.120]  But that could either,
[01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:42.920]  well, let me get through some of the questions,
[01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:47.920]  but yeah, this is the, what causes hollow stems topic?
[01:38:48.440 --> 01:38:49.280]  So if you guys.
[01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:51.880]  Oh, I have no idea, but I'm very curious.
[01:38:51.880 --> 01:38:53.160]  Look at that.
[01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:54.640]  People want you guys to keep going,
[01:38:54.640 --> 01:38:57.280]  but all right, let me get to some of the questions.
[01:38:57.280 --> 01:39:01.480]  So Rotten Skateboards asked,
[01:39:05.060 --> 01:39:06.380]  let me just queue it up.
[01:39:07.860 --> 01:39:09.700]  So like, what?
[01:39:10.780 --> 01:39:15.400]  Hold on.
[01:39:15.400 --> 01:39:20.200]  So, but you guys talk about like breeding best practices.
[01:39:20.200 --> 01:39:23.560]  And I think if you, whether you're pollen chucking
[01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:25.480]  or with a little more intent,
[01:39:25.480 --> 01:39:27.880]  like have you bothered to send those seeds out
[01:39:27.880 --> 01:39:29.880]  to people in different environments
[01:39:29.880 --> 01:39:32.120]  or tested them yourself in different environments
[01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:34.280]  to put them through the ringers?
[01:39:34.280 --> 01:39:35.680]  So can you talk about.
[01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:38.840]  I guess I'll chime in on.
[01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:40.520]  Take this question wherever you want to.
[01:39:40.520 --> 01:39:41.760]  Yeah, I'll chime on that.
[01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:45.360]  So in traditional breeding or pure breeding,
[01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:48.840]  so taking it through different environments
[01:39:48.840 --> 01:39:50.320]  is part of the standard breeding.
[01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:54.280]  So it's usually the first year you kind of work across
[01:39:54.280 --> 01:39:58.080]  and then you back breed it or self at the second,
[01:39:58.080 --> 01:39:59.480]  third, fourth year.
[01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:02.160]  And then it's usually when you get to six, seven generations
[01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:06.520]  that you'll send that to other farms and get other climates.
[01:40:06.520 --> 01:40:08.960]  And so now a true breeding or an IBL
[01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:12.760]  will still show phenotypes based on environmental factors.
[01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:15.400]  It won't be a genetic trait,
[01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:18.360]  but yeah, that's usually the last step in commercial lines.
[01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:21.360]  So like tomatoes, hops, anything else like that,
[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:22.240]  that's the final step.
[01:40:22.240 --> 01:40:23.440]  You send it out there.
[01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:25.480]  Does it still hold that disease resistance?
[01:40:25.480 --> 01:40:28.120]  Does it still perform the same way?
[01:40:28.120 --> 01:40:30.280]  And so, and then if it passes that test,
[01:40:30.280 --> 01:40:33.440]  then it's create the variety.
[01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:36.600]  And so, yeah, that's the final tail end of a six, seven,
[01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:38.120]  sometimes eight year process
[01:40:38.120 --> 01:40:40.920]  to create some of these inbred lines.
[01:40:43.680 --> 01:40:47.760]  Yeah, so we, like I primarily grow in greenhouses
[01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:51.440]  and we have an indoor room that we run everything through.
[01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:54.160]  This year, I'm definitely, I'm setting up more outdoor space.
[01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:57.160]  My first couple of years I ran some outdoor,
[01:40:57.240 --> 01:41:02.240]  my soil is just the way that my property is set up.
[01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:05.200]  I have like three feet of topsoil and a clay hard pan.
[01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:06.720]  And so if spring rolls around,
[01:41:06.720 --> 01:41:08.160]  everything just gets kind of root rot.
[01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:09.840]  So we're gonna do pots this year
[01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:12.280]  and start doing more outdoor testing.
[01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:13.400]  But yeah, we do send,
[01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:17.960]  we send them out to other people that can grow outdoors.
[01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:20.240]  And then we also work with the universities
[01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:22.280]  that grow a lot of our stuff out every year
[01:41:22.280 --> 01:41:23.960]  and they give us feedback.
[01:41:23.960 --> 01:41:28.960]  So my main mode of testing is greenhouse and indoor,
[01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:31.040]  which is kind of like,
[01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:33.640]  especially for some of my hemp varieties
[01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:38.000]  is really what they're geared for anyway.
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.360]  So, I'm not doing a lot of big production runs
[01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:42.560]  that are geared for outdoor farms at this,
[01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:43.600]  like the last few years,
[01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:46.280]  I've just kind of been focusing on small batch,
[01:41:46.280 --> 01:41:48.480]  premium flower varieties that are,
[01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:50.720]  primarily being grown indoors and greenhouses.
[01:41:51.160 --> 01:41:55.640]  That's where I focus my testing on at this time.
[01:41:55.640 --> 01:41:58.400]  But yeah, same, like if I do,
[01:41:58.400 --> 01:42:00.240]  every year I grow some outdoor plants
[01:42:01.160 --> 01:42:02.800]  and do some stuff like that,
[01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:05.680]  but I'm definitely gonna be expanding that this year.
[01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:07.720]  And yeah, I just wanna say like there,
[01:42:08.680 --> 01:42:10.800]  without, I think I brought, we brought up Oregon CBD,
[01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:13.400]  but there are a ton of other breeders out there
[01:42:13.400 --> 01:42:16.560]  like that do stable production lines.
[01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:20.200]  I think I know like High Alpine is one,
[01:42:20.720 --> 01:42:24.040]  doing like F1 photo, or photo by auto hybrids
[01:42:24.040 --> 01:42:26.200]  that a lot of farms are successful with.
[01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:29.840]  Davis herb farms, East work cultivars,
[01:42:30.840 --> 01:42:32.640]  Green Luster and Zoe Therapeutics,
[01:42:32.640 --> 01:42:33.720]  two big breeders,
[01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:36.600]  that I think a lot of people are happy
[01:42:36.600 --> 01:42:37.800]  in growing their genetics.
[01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:40.640]  I mean, there's countless others.
[01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:43.760]  I know Dogtoe Farms was just texting me
[01:42:43.760 --> 01:42:44.920]  a bunch of different farms.
[01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:46.120]  I couldn't write them down fast enough,
[01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:47.760]  but it's like, they're,
[01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:50.000]  if you, it's not that they don't exist,
[01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:52.760]  but they are out there and they do,
[01:42:52.760 --> 01:42:53.960]  they're pumping out seed.
[01:42:53.960 --> 01:42:54.920]  And a lot of them,
[01:42:55.840 --> 01:42:57.880]  well, they don't sell small amounts.
[01:42:57.880 --> 01:43:01.240]  So it's like, they're really just geared towards farmers.
[01:43:01.240 --> 01:43:04.480]  Whereas like, I think even Thomas,
[01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:05.960]  it's like the minimum seed pack you can buy
[01:43:05.960 --> 01:43:07.920]  is a hundred count, which,
[01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:08.960]  a home grower might do that,
[01:43:08.960 --> 01:43:10.920]  but it's still geared towards like
[01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:13.840]  the smaller craft side of farming.
[01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:16.520]  But if you, maybe we can put together
[01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:21.600]  a completed list of some of the bigger hemp seed producers
[01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:23.880]  for farmers to use as a resource.
[01:43:23.880 --> 01:43:26.200]  Like I know you, Colin, probably know some,
[01:43:26.200 --> 01:43:29.640]  I could probably think of maybe 15 or 20,
[01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:34.200]  that would be like, okay, if I'm a farmer
[01:43:34.200 --> 01:43:39.200]  and I want to buy bulk seed of some solid varieties,
[01:43:39.200 --> 01:43:41.320]  that would be a good resource, I think.
[01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:43.280]  So yeah, I don't wanna, I mean,
[01:43:43.280 --> 01:43:45.360]  I don't wanna just leave Oregon CBD on the table
[01:43:45.400 --> 01:43:49.840]  because they are the big one, but like you said,
[01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:52.200]  they have kind of, a lot of farmers have moved away from them
[01:43:52.200 --> 01:43:53.560]  because that's all anybody could buy
[01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:54.880]  for the last several years.
[01:43:56.160 --> 01:43:58.480]  But there are farms doing proper work.
[01:43:58.480 --> 01:44:02.000]  Beacon Hemp was doing a lot of like auto flower varieties
[01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:03.520]  that were solid.
[01:44:05.200 --> 01:44:06.040]  So yeah.
[01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:08.560]  Any more questions?
[01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:09.640]  Peter.
[01:44:19.530 --> 01:44:24.530]  Oh, sorry, you had an easy down the middle hanging slider.
[01:44:30.490 --> 01:44:32.250]  As you can see, let me.
[01:44:34.170 --> 01:44:38.490]  Favorite two or three cultivars you liked in the last year,
[01:44:38.490 --> 01:44:39.850]  what's in your head stash?
[01:44:41.930 --> 01:44:44.730]  Oh, you want me to go first?
[01:44:44.730 --> 01:44:45.570]  Yeah, go for it.
[01:44:46.610 --> 01:44:49.290]  So one of my favorites that we bred
[01:44:49.290 --> 01:44:51.930]  was Fatso by Yeti OG Cross.
[01:44:51.930 --> 01:44:54.330]  Like that's probably my go-to type one.
[01:44:55.450 --> 01:44:59.770]  It is, the Fatso is from Canerado,
[01:44:59.770 --> 01:45:04.290]  but it basically just has like some really funky GMO
[01:45:04.290 --> 01:45:07.490]  profiles and then it's, you know, it's super potent.
[01:45:08.570 --> 01:45:10.330]  I think for like my mixed ratio,
[01:45:10.330 --> 01:45:14.050]  like I like these original Zombie Kush F2s
[01:45:14.050 --> 01:45:15.690]  that I've been kind of hunted through.
[01:45:16.210 --> 01:45:17.370]  There's a mixture of chemotypes,
[01:45:17.370 --> 01:45:20.130]  like they're CBD dominance, they're CBG,
[01:45:20.130 --> 01:45:22.130]  and then you get some mixed ratios in there.
[01:45:22.130 --> 01:45:24.850]  And that's the one that I'm really like this tier.
[01:45:24.850 --> 01:45:26.250]  I haven't even dropped any of the flower.
[01:45:26.250 --> 01:45:28.410]  I need, you know, it's still sitting in bins,
[01:45:28.410 --> 01:45:30.850]  but I've been sampling that.
[01:45:30.850 --> 01:45:33.290]  And then for CBD, man,
[01:45:38.410 --> 01:45:41.690]  one of the ones that I grew out from our Arcade E-Cross
[01:45:41.690 --> 01:45:44.810]  that it was, it's an interstellar, I call it,
[01:45:44.850 --> 01:45:48.610]  but it's the pollen donor was a Remedy Kush Diesel.
[01:45:48.610 --> 01:45:53.010]  And the female was a Deep Space selection.
[01:45:53.010 --> 01:45:57.050]  So it's basically one of my Abacus crosses.
[01:45:57.050 --> 01:46:01.290]  And man, people blew past Abacus,
[01:46:01.290 --> 01:46:02.610]  but that's still one of like,
[01:46:02.610 --> 01:46:04.650]  it's so many awesome poops.
[01:46:04.650 --> 01:46:05.930]  I love growing your Deep Space.
[01:46:05.930 --> 01:46:10.090]  Remember that red, just deep red Deep Space I had?
[01:46:10.090 --> 01:46:10.930]  That was gnarly.
[01:46:10.930 --> 01:46:11.770]  That was wild, man.
[01:46:11.770 --> 01:46:13.530]  That was like the coolest, that was one of the coolest,
[01:46:14.170 --> 01:46:15.010]  you should have cloned that.
[01:46:15.010 --> 01:46:17.810]  That would have been like, oh, talk about ornamental.
[01:46:17.810 --> 01:46:20.010]  You could have bred that and like, yeah.
[01:46:20.010 --> 01:46:21.770]  Yeah, it looked like deep red crab legs.
[01:46:21.770 --> 01:46:23.970]  Like it was crazy stock.
[01:46:23.970 --> 01:46:25.650]  Yeah, but the cool thing with the Deep Space
[01:46:25.650 --> 01:46:27.210]  is it does have some of those earthy,
[01:46:27.210 --> 01:46:30.850]  fuely kind of like oily profiles that you can tease out.
[01:46:30.850 --> 01:46:33.370]  And I think with the Remedy Kush Diesel in there,
[01:46:33.370 --> 01:46:36.090]  you get that and it's a heavy yielder.
[01:46:36.090 --> 01:46:38.010]  They're pretty uniform.
[01:46:38.010 --> 01:46:39.170]  I mean, you get some variability
[01:46:39.170 --> 01:46:41.250]  and like maybe bud size, but dense
[01:46:41.250 --> 01:46:42.810]  so that you can mix the phenotypes.
[01:46:43.130 --> 01:46:46.010]  And sell good flower, smokable flower.
[01:46:46.010 --> 01:46:50.130]  And then the profiles are fairly similar across the board
[01:46:50.130 --> 01:46:53.530]  with that kind of earthy, musky kind of fun coming from.
[01:46:53.530 --> 01:46:57.490]  And I might even have a little bit left on the store.
[01:46:57.490 --> 01:47:00.650]  But yeah, those would be my top three,
[01:47:00.650 --> 01:47:05.330]  the CBD, a mixed ratio and my THC dominant.
[01:47:05.330 --> 01:47:08.610]  Yeah, I guess my top two CBD anyways
[01:47:08.610 --> 01:47:11.330]  from this last crop would probably be,
[01:47:11.330 --> 01:47:14.690]  I really liked the cakeberry that Oregon CBD did.
[01:47:14.690 --> 01:47:18.330]  That has such a unique kind of sweet flavor to it.
[01:47:18.330 --> 01:47:20.730]  I'm curious, I was curious about that, yeah.
[01:47:20.730 --> 01:47:22.170]  Yeah, I'm a big fan of that.
[01:47:22.170 --> 01:47:24.130]  Like just really nice sweet flavor
[01:47:24.130 --> 01:47:25.310]  and it grew pretty well.
[01:47:25.310 --> 01:47:26.810]  The buds were a little airy,
[01:47:26.810 --> 01:47:29.730]  but I mean, it made up for kind of that terpene.
[01:47:29.730 --> 01:47:32.150]  And then the other big one that really stood out
[01:47:32.150 --> 01:47:35.410]  was Orange Julius from the Hemp Mine, Dr. Justice.
[01:47:35.410 --> 01:47:39.030]  Allison's kind of crosses, she sent me some clones.
[01:47:39.030 --> 01:47:40.090]  That's one of those, you know,
[01:47:40.090 --> 01:47:43.210]  you get a lot of these cultivars that you put names on it
[01:47:43.210 --> 01:47:46.310]  and you get like, I kind of get the strawberries or,
[01:47:46.310 --> 01:47:47.890]  but this one is Orange Julius.
[01:47:47.890 --> 01:47:49.530]  Like it smelled like fresh oranges.
[01:47:49.530 --> 01:47:50.450]  Like it was undeniable.
[01:47:50.450 --> 01:47:53.410]  You could open a bag up to any non cannabis person.
[01:47:53.410 --> 01:47:55.090]  They'd be like, man, that smells like oranges.
[01:47:55.090 --> 01:47:56.670]  So that was a big standout,
[01:47:56.670 --> 01:47:58.770]  I think from this last run anyways.
[01:47:59.950 --> 01:48:01.450]  That's cool.
[01:48:01.450 --> 01:48:03.410]  I'll have to check that one out.
[01:48:03.410 --> 01:48:05.570]  Yeah, she's got a handful of good stuff that we grew.
[01:48:05.570 --> 01:48:07.250]  I'm not the best at keeping clones alive.
[01:48:07.250 --> 01:48:09.330]  So I kind of lost a few
[01:48:09.330 --> 01:48:10.810]  because she shipped unrooted clones.
[01:48:10.810 --> 01:48:14.570]  So that was an interesting process, but.
[01:48:14.570 --> 01:48:15.810]  Yeah, they can, you know,
[01:48:15.810 --> 01:48:17.890]  the unrooted clones handle the shipping process
[01:48:17.890 --> 01:48:19.530]  a little better, but yeah, then once you get them,
[01:48:19.530 --> 01:48:21.490]  you gotta root them, so.
[01:48:21.490 --> 01:48:24.310]  Yeah, and I'm not, I'm admittedly not the best at clones.
[01:48:24.310 --> 01:48:26.170]  So even having a little less vigor
[01:48:26.170 --> 01:48:27.770]  than they normally would coming right off a plant,
[01:48:27.770 --> 01:48:29.170]  I struggled a little.
[01:48:29.170 --> 01:48:30.450]  Because again, I'm a seed guy.
[01:48:30.450 --> 01:48:32.490]  I don't do clones very often, so.
[01:48:32.490 --> 01:48:34.690]  Yeah, which I mean, you know, that's another thing.
[01:48:34.690 --> 01:48:36.770]  If you can cut out the cost of keeping moms
[01:48:36.770 --> 01:48:38.450]  and taking clones, I mean, that's huge
[01:48:38.810 --> 01:48:40.490]  for a big operation, so.
[01:48:40.490 --> 01:48:41.330]  Right.
[01:48:45.050 --> 01:48:46.010]  Any more, Peter?
[01:48:47.770 --> 01:48:48.610]  I wonder if.
[01:48:52.510 --> 01:48:55.590]  But yeah, no, that's, I mean, pretty much I haven't,
[01:48:55.590 --> 01:48:57.310]  like the last couple of pheno hunts
[01:48:57.310 --> 01:48:59.110]  have been mostly my own stuff.
[01:48:59.110 --> 01:49:02.430]  But the next one, I've got a bunch of different stuff going.
[01:49:02.430 --> 01:49:03.270]  So I'm kind of excited.
[01:49:03.270 --> 01:49:05.030]  It's always exciting seeing stuff that's not yours
[01:49:05.030 --> 01:49:06.370]  because you already like, with your own stuff,
[01:49:06.370 --> 01:49:08.870]  you already kind of know what to anticipate.
[01:49:09.390 --> 01:49:10.230]  Right.
[01:49:10.230 --> 01:49:11.050]  But, but yeah.
[01:49:12.470 --> 01:49:14.790]  Sorry, when you asked if there are any more questions,
[01:49:14.790 --> 01:49:18.910]  I was like behind this row, Sheldon.
[01:49:18.910 --> 01:49:19.750]  Oh, you're good.
[01:49:26.270 --> 01:49:28.890]  So here's a CBG question.
[01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:39.420]  If it mimics an endogenous one.
[01:49:42.360 --> 01:49:44.120]  I'll let you take that one, Floyd.
[01:49:44.120 --> 01:49:47.680]  I was gonna say, I think we need a medical.
[01:49:48.680 --> 01:49:49.720]  Yeah, honestly.
[01:49:49.720 --> 01:49:51.240]  Or a scientist.
[01:49:51.240 --> 01:49:52.720]  I have no idea.
[01:49:52.720 --> 01:49:56.240]  Like all I know with CBG has been anecdotal
[01:49:56.240 --> 01:49:58.080]  and some people don't like it.
[01:49:58.080 --> 01:50:00.160]  And then the people that do like it, love it.
[01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:03.680]  I do know that we've had a lot of success
[01:50:03.680 --> 01:50:06.440]  with treating Crohn's with CBG.
[01:50:06.440 --> 01:50:09.240]  And like, you know, sometimes people don't like CBG
[01:50:09.240 --> 01:50:10.920]  on its own, but I can tell you,
[01:50:10.920 --> 01:50:13.160]  if you mix it with like a one-to-one CBD
[01:50:13.160 --> 01:50:16.480]  or one-to-one THC, it becomes a lot more enjoyable.
[01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:19.400]  And I think, you know, I don't know.
[01:50:19.400 --> 01:50:21.360]  I don't think enough people have kind of played around
[01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:23.520]  with it, but if, and I've said this before,
[01:50:23.520 --> 01:50:28.280]  if you've got gut issues, any kind of gut issues, try CBG.
[01:50:28.280 --> 01:50:32.280]  And I would try it consistently, like three times a day
[01:50:32.280 --> 01:50:34.720]  for at least a month before you throw in the towel.
[01:50:34.720 --> 01:50:36.280]  And then also make sure that you're getting
[01:50:36.280 --> 01:50:39.640]  a potent product, you know, like we cram, you know,
[01:50:39.640 --> 01:50:42.240]  over, you know, it's like three and a half,
[01:50:42.680 --> 01:50:46.960]  four grams of distillate into a one ounce tincture bottle.
[01:50:46.960 --> 01:50:50.000]  So, you know, you're basically guaranteed 3000 milligrams
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:51.760]  of total active cannabinoids.
[01:50:51.760 --> 01:50:54.920]  But I find that a one-to-one CBD, CBG is tolerated
[01:50:54.920 --> 01:50:56.240]  by most people.
[01:50:56.240 --> 01:50:58.440]  And it's great.
[01:50:58.440 --> 01:51:02.360]  CBG is great for energy in general, but like, but yeah,
[01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:04.920]  you know, I'm not a doctor, but I've just, you know,
[01:51:04.920 --> 01:51:08.160]  I've seen it change enough people and help enough people
[01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:11.720]  that that's kind of the message that I get out there, so.
[01:51:12.960 --> 01:51:15.080]  Yeah, and honestly gut issues nowadays,
[01:51:15.080 --> 01:51:17.040]  like I don't know how many people have, you know,
[01:51:17.040 --> 01:51:21.440]  I know that have had colon cancer, that deal with IBS,
[01:51:21.440 --> 01:51:23.800]  that deal with some form of Crohn's.
[01:51:23.800 --> 01:51:25.680]  And it's, you know, it's just because no matter
[01:51:25.680 --> 01:51:28.160]  how clean our diet is, it's, you know, there's toxins
[01:51:28.160 --> 01:51:29.280]  in our water and our food.
[01:51:29.280 --> 01:51:32.560]  I mean, it's everywhere, you know, so in our air.
[01:51:32.560 --> 01:51:35.880]  So it's like, you can't get away from it.
[01:51:35.880 --> 01:51:38.280]  Yeah, and just quickly, there's someone with,
[01:51:38.280 --> 01:51:40.320]  who does have gut issues.
[01:51:40.360 --> 01:51:43.720]  Yeah, CBC and CBD with CBG.
[01:51:43.720 --> 01:51:46.440]  Yeah, CBC, yeah, CBC is, you know,
[01:51:46.440 --> 01:51:48.600]  I don't know a lot about it, but I do know like,
[01:51:48.600 --> 01:51:50.160]  especially because like, you know,
[01:51:50.160 --> 01:51:53.360]  we also sell like raw distillate for folks
[01:51:53.360 --> 01:51:55.880]  that want to formulate their own products
[01:51:55.880 --> 01:51:57.800]  and just adding a little bit of CBC prevents
[01:51:57.800 --> 01:51:59.680]  the crystallization of CBD.
[01:51:59.680 --> 01:52:03.600]  And so in that way, it's kind of more of a, you know,
[01:52:03.600 --> 01:52:05.240]  it's more functional, but it's, you know,
[01:52:05.240 --> 01:52:08.280]  and I know people use it in carts to keep the viscosity,
[01:52:08.280 --> 01:52:10.880]  but yeah, I'd be curious to know if people that have,
[01:52:10.880 --> 01:52:12.800]  you know, kind of experimented with CBC
[01:52:12.800 --> 01:52:15.160]  and what that might help with.
[01:52:15.160 --> 01:52:17.720]  And then what was the last, oh, CBN, yeah, CBN is great.
[01:52:17.720 --> 01:52:20.720]  Like as far as like, there's one product
[01:52:20.720 --> 01:52:22.880]  that would be, might be considered, you know,
[01:52:22.880 --> 01:52:25.480]  an isomer or something that they, you know,
[01:52:25.480 --> 01:52:28.880]  that they make, and that would be CBN.
[01:52:28.880 --> 01:52:33.040]  And I find that it's like, it's amazing for kind of sleep,
[01:52:33.040 --> 01:52:35.720]  muscle relaxation and stuff like that.
[01:52:35.720 --> 01:52:38.400]  I mean, you know, and like this plant is so subjective
[01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:41.040]  that you gotta just, you know, you gotta experiment
[01:52:41.040 --> 01:52:44.080]  with a lot of this stuff on your own, but yeah.
[01:52:45.240 --> 01:52:46.560]  Yeah, CBN is a good one.
[01:52:48.040 --> 01:52:50.160]  Even if you get isolate, if you can find isolate
[01:52:50.160 --> 01:52:51.960]  and you can mix it into a full spectrum distillate,
[01:52:51.960 --> 01:52:54.000]  that's what I would recommend.
[01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.040]  So you're getting the full entourage, so.
[01:53:00.930 --> 01:53:02.770]  Is that CBC?
[01:53:02.770 --> 01:53:06.290]  Yeah, yep, CB2 receptor agonist.
[01:53:07.290 --> 01:53:12.290]  Yeah, that's a good, good, good rabbit hole to go down.
[01:53:12.370 --> 01:53:13.330]  I'll check it out.
[01:53:16.610 --> 01:53:18.090]  Too toasty because it was what?
[01:53:18.090 --> 01:53:20.010]  Too hot, is that what they said?
[01:53:20.010 --> 01:53:21.290]  It was too sticky.
[01:53:23.810 --> 01:53:25.010]  Too sticky?
[01:53:25.010 --> 01:53:26.010]  So did they do that?
[01:53:26.010 --> 01:53:30.250]  Yeah, I mean, so if you're trying to like get people
[01:53:30.250 --> 01:53:32.650]  on board to cannabis that have never tried it,
[01:53:32.770 --> 01:53:35.090]  MCT tinctures or olive oil tinctures
[01:53:35.090 --> 01:53:36.730]  are in just the tincture in general,
[01:53:36.730 --> 01:53:38.530]  something that they could take sublingually
[01:53:38.530 --> 01:53:39.530]  is gonna be your best bet.
[01:53:39.530 --> 01:53:41.530]  Most people are, you know, like if you've never,
[01:53:41.530 --> 01:53:43.450]  you're not a smoker, you're not gonna smoke cannabis
[01:53:43.450 --> 01:53:45.130]  and even getting somebody to vape something
[01:53:45.130 --> 01:53:46.450]  is can be hard enough.
[01:53:46.450 --> 01:53:49.330]  So tinctures are your go-to.
[01:53:50.330 --> 01:53:54.010]  You know, I find that most of like,
[01:53:54.010 --> 01:53:57.490]  most folks are a little less hesitant to try a tincture.
[01:53:57.490 --> 01:53:58.970]  Yeah, I'd second that.
[01:53:58.970 --> 01:54:01.530]  Our tinctures and our candy are some of our best sellers.
[01:54:01.730 --> 01:54:04.170]  Yeah, gummies too, I think are awesome
[01:54:04.170 --> 01:54:06.610]  if you can get the dosage right.
[01:54:06.610 --> 01:54:10.010]  I like tinctures just cause like no sugar, no nothing,
[01:54:10.010 --> 01:54:12.890]  but like, yeah, some people don't like the flavor
[01:54:12.890 --> 01:54:17.890]  of the raw cannabis oil, so gummies or capsules.
[01:54:20.290 --> 01:54:22.290]  Raws and capsules are great.
[01:54:22.290 --> 01:54:25.330]  So before we let you guys go,
[01:54:25.330 --> 01:54:28.170]  people did not want you to be able to sneak out
[01:54:28.170 --> 01:54:29.930]  of the house and get in the house.
[01:54:29.970 --> 01:54:31.410]  So they wanted you to be able to sneak out
[01:54:31.410 --> 01:54:32.810]  of the hollow stem question.
[01:54:32.810 --> 01:54:35.090]  So let's throw this up there
[01:54:35.090 --> 01:54:36.370]  and why don't you walk us through,
[01:54:36.370 --> 01:54:40.370]  cause this is both observational and research, correct?
[01:54:40.370 --> 01:54:44.810]  Yeah, so, and this is kind of the totaling
[01:54:44.810 --> 01:54:46.090]  that line of bro science.
[01:54:46.090 --> 01:54:49.610]  I think there's a camp out there that is convinced
[01:54:49.610 --> 01:54:53.850]  this is like a boron, it's a nutrient based issue.
[01:54:53.850 --> 01:54:57.210]  And I followed up with those people
[01:54:57.210 --> 01:54:59.450]  and there's no data to really back it up.
[01:54:59.970 --> 01:55:00.810]  It's a lot of anecdotal.
[01:55:00.810 --> 01:55:02.090]  And so when you're dealing with anecdotal
[01:55:02.090 --> 01:55:03.250]  with different phenos and climates,
[01:55:03.250 --> 01:55:05.890]  there's so much that can go on.
[01:55:05.890 --> 01:55:10.850]  And so we've taken a quick kind of research
[01:55:10.850 --> 01:55:14.630]  in our crop last round, and we basically set the standard
[01:55:14.630 --> 01:55:18.410]  for we're gonna give this plant all the boron
[01:55:18.410 --> 01:55:21.250]  and we're basically trying to solve the hollow stem issue
[01:55:21.250 --> 01:55:26.250]  by doing the things that the pro boron people are saying.
[01:55:26.250 --> 01:55:28.330]  So, with the boron and the calcium ratios,
[01:55:28.690 --> 01:55:31.570]  we mess with those and tweak those.
[01:55:31.570 --> 01:55:33.210]  And no matter what we could do,
[01:55:33.210 --> 01:55:35.250]  we couldn't mimic the results.
[01:55:35.250 --> 01:55:39.730]  And that's the epitome of what research and science is.
[01:55:39.730 --> 01:55:41.690]  You have to be able to make a claim,
[01:55:41.690 --> 01:55:43.910]  then you have to back it up with results.
[01:55:43.910 --> 01:55:45.750]  And then you have to be able to let other people
[01:55:45.750 --> 01:55:47.070]  mimic those results.
[01:55:47.070 --> 01:55:50.070]  And so that's something that we just haven't been able to do.
[01:55:50.070 --> 01:55:51.390]  We've never been able to replicate it.
[01:55:51.390 --> 01:55:53.690]  I've talked to a lot of other people
[01:55:53.690 --> 01:55:55.990]  or growers at different universities.
[01:55:55.990 --> 01:55:58.310]  They haven't been able to replicate it.
[01:55:58.310 --> 01:56:01.030]  So it's one of those things where I'm not gonna say 100%
[01:56:01.030 --> 01:56:03.190]  that has no relation to boron.
[01:56:03.190 --> 01:56:06.290]  It may have some play into it.
[01:56:07.190 --> 01:56:11.310]  But so my takeaway from this is it's mostly a genetic thing.
[01:56:11.310 --> 01:56:14.710]  We see it in certain genetics very predictably,
[01:56:14.710 --> 01:56:17.690]  and we don't see it in other genetics,
[01:56:17.690 --> 01:56:21.590]  regardless of boron levels and things we throw at it.
[01:56:21.590 --> 01:56:22.750]  And then there's another,
[01:56:22.750 --> 01:56:24.470]  the thing a lot of people tend to skip over
[01:56:24.470 --> 01:56:27.750]  this whole idea of is,
[01:56:27.750 --> 01:56:31.070]  they put a lot of effort into let's pack it full of boron
[01:56:31.070 --> 01:56:33.350]  with crazy PPM levels.
[01:56:33.350 --> 01:56:36.830]  And I kind of think they negate the why.
[01:56:36.830 --> 01:56:39.290]  Hollow stems, at least from what we've seen
[01:56:39.290 --> 01:56:42.670]  in our greenhouse, and we run up to 2000 plants at a time.
[01:56:42.670 --> 01:56:46.230]  So we see enough replicates to make it significant.
[01:56:46.230 --> 01:56:51.090]  We don't see any, I guess, decline in health
[01:56:51.090 --> 01:56:52.870]  from the hollow stem plants.
[01:56:52.870 --> 01:56:54.130]  We don't see any less vigor.
[01:56:54.790 --> 01:56:55.810]  We don't see any issues with it.
[01:56:55.810 --> 01:56:58.450]  And some people say, well, it doesn't clone as easily.
[01:56:58.450 --> 01:57:01.250]  I've cloned hollow stem plants.
[01:57:01.250 --> 01:57:02.530]  But again, if you're cloning,
[01:57:02.530 --> 01:57:04.150]  maybe that does present some issues.
[01:57:04.150 --> 01:57:07.090]  But usually you see the hollow pith on the main stem,
[01:57:07.090 --> 01:57:09.330]  not so much on the axillary stems.
[01:57:09.330 --> 01:57:11.650]  And most people aren't cloning the main stems anyway.
[01:57:11.650 --> 01:57:12.970]  So it kind of negates that.
[01:57:12.970 --> 01:57:14.770]  But it's another one of those kind of,
[01:57:14.770 --> 01:57:17.610]  it goes around and it's got a group of core followers
[01:57:17.610 --> 01:57:20.210]  that believe it, and without a doubt,
[01:57:20.210 --> 01:57:22.010]  and there's little to back it up.
[01:57:22.010 --> 01:57:25.250]  So we did a quick trial to say, hey, these are our numbers.
[01:57:25.250 --> 01:57:26.410]  These are our plant analysis.
[01:57:26.410 --> 01:57:27.810]  This is what we gave it.
[01:57:27.810 --> 01:57:29.330]  We can replicate it.
[01:57:29.330 --> 01:57:30.690]  And then we kind of throw it out to the community,
[01:57:30.690 --> 01:57:32.770]  be like, hey, somebody else replicate it.
[01:57:32.770 --> 01:57:36.850]  So yeah, it's a hot topic, but yeah.
[01:57:36.850 --> 01:57:38.490]  I mean, I guess I just put the data out there
[01:57:38.490 --> 01:57:40.290]  and say, hey, this is what I've experienced.
[01:57:40.290 --> 01:57:43.330]  Well, so it's interesting kind of the,
[01:57:43.330 --> 01:57:44.690]  and I'll let you go first,
[01:57:44.690 --> 01:57:46.850]  but we can get to some of the comments,
[01:57:46.850 --> 01:57:49.030]  like this is cutting edge solutions
[01:57:49.030 --> 01:57:50.930]  and talking about Rob Clark,
[01:57:50.930 --> 01:57:52.170]  but go ahead, Floyd.
[01:57:53.050 --> 01:57:54.850]  Oh, I was just gonna say, like, I've seen it,
[01:57:54.850 --> 01:57:57.530]  you know, like I see it often when I'm running from seed,
[01:57:57.530 --> 01:58:01.050]  but like, I don't even know if I could think of a clone run
[01:58:01.050 --> 01:58:02.170]  that has a hollow stem.
[01:58:02.170 --> 01:58:05.010]  Like, I think once you take a cutting, I'd be hard,
[01:58:05.010 --> 01:58:05.890]  you know, I don't know.
[01:58:05.890 --> 01:58:07.410]  I guess I haven't really paid much attention,
[01:58:07.410 --> 01:58:09.490]  but like I've got some plants out there now
[01:58:09.490 --> 01:58:12.130]  that are just massive that you could probably cut it in half
[01:58:12.130 --> 01:58:13.570]  and stick your thumb in the stem.
[01:58:13.570 --> 01:58:16.730]  So, and the plant is as healthy as could be.
[01:58:16.730 --> 01:58:18.970]  So, but you can feel it, right?
[01:58:18.970 --> 01:58:22.050]  Like you can kind of grab that stem
[01:58:22.050 --> 01:58:24.130]  and kind of feel around it and you know it's hollow in there
[01:58:24.130 --> 01:58:25.290]  and then as you go down the base,
[01:58:25.290 --> 01:58:27.810]  it gets, you know, a little more dense.
[01:58:27.810 --> 01:58:30.570]  So, yeah, I mean, it's-
[01:58:30.570 --> 01:58:33.010]  And you know, and some people talk about like pith autolysis
[01:58:33.010 --> 01:58:35.250]  and all these different things,
[01:58:35.250 --> 01:58:38.250]  but they don't really relate to what we're seeing.
[01:58:38.250 --> 01:58:39.170]  And that's the hard thing.
[01:58:39.170 --> 01:58:41.130]  It's like, there's small truths into everything.
[01:58:41.130 --> 01:58:42.730]  There's so many variables in plant science
[01:58:42.730 --> 01:58:45.490]  that it's like a small grain of truth
[01:58:45.490 --> 01:58:47.650]  can get exploded into, you know,
[01:58:47.650 --> 01:58:49.490]  something that somebody kind of like,
[01:58:49.490 --> 01:58:50.930]  hey, this is how it is.
[01:58:50.930 --> 01:58:53.530]  And it's like, and this is just a genetic,
[01:58:53.530 --> 01:58:55.890]  it's a genetic thing that can be influenced
[01:58:55.890 --> 01:58:58.010]  by phenotypical reactions
[01:58:58.010 --> 01:58:59.910]  in whatever climate you're growing in.
[01:59:00.970 --> 01:59:03.090]  But you know, until somebody really focuses
[01:59:03.090 --> 01:59:05.570]  and wants to like make their PhD thesis on this,
[01:59:05.570 --> 01:59:07.130]  I think it kind of stands as,
[01:59:07.130 --> 01:59:09.290]  and you talk to traditional ag,
[01:59:09.290 --> 01:59:11.210]  again, there's not a lot of research out there on it
[01:59:11.210 --> 01:59:12.050]  because it's one of those things
[01:59:12.050 --> 01:59:13.410]  where it's like, why are we gonna chase this?
[01:59:13.410 --> 01:59:15.610]  It's not detrimental to the plant.
[01:59:15.610 --> 01:59:19.150]  And in the case that let's say boron
[01:59:19.150 --> 01:59:20.770]  does solve this problem.
[01:59:20.770 --> 01:59:22.970]  And so you're, I mean,
[01:59:22.970 --> 01:59:24.930]  it was like 10 times the amount of boron
[01:59:24.930 --> 01:59:26.170]  you would apply at it.
[01:59:26.170 --> 01:59:28.170]  And my question would be, why would you do that?
[01:59:28.170 --> 01:59:29.930]  Just save yourself the money on boron
[01:59:29.930 --> 01:59:32.310]  and just let it be its hollow self.
[01:59:34.770 --> 01:59:37.530]  Yeah, yeah, no, I haven't noticed any detriment.
[01:59:37.530 --> 01:59:40.330]  So I've never really given it much attention or thought.
[01:59:42.810 --> 01:59:43.650]  Oh, that makes sense.
[01:59:43.650 --> 01:59:44.650]  Yeah, that's a good point.
[01:59:44.650 --> 01:59:47.650]  Yeah, because they're a lot easier to break down.
[01:59:47.650 --> 01:59:49.470]  So when they do the decorification,
[01:59:49.470 --> 01:59:51.610]  they are a lot easier to split the pith apart
[01:59:51.610 --> 01:59:53.410]  and because there really isn't much there.
[01:59:53.410 --> 01:59:55.250]  And so, yeah, at one point,
[01:59:55.250 --> 01:59:56.970]  and I think I pointed this out somewhere
[01:59:56.970 --> 01:59:58.890]  in the stream of comments is,
[01:59:58.890 --> 02:00:01.490]  is yeah, they were breeding for that on purpose
[02:00:01.490 --> 02:00:03.790]  to create an easier production.
[02:00:03.790 --> 02:00:06.730]  So the fact that there was a genetic link to it,
[02:00:06.730 --> 02:00:08.610]  again, kind of shades light on the fact
[02:00:08.610 --> 02:00:10.730]  that this is probably just genetics.
[02:00:10.730 --> 02:00:11.570]  Oh, interesting.
[02:00:11.570 --> 02:00:12.390]  That's golden coast.
[02:00:12.390 --> 02:00:13.330]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:00:13.890 --> 02:00:15.050]  Yeah, that's wild.
[02:00:15.050 --> 02:00:17.890]  More psychoactive than stems best used for textiles.
[02:00:17.890 --> 02:00:19.050]  Yeah, interesting.
[02:00:19.050 --> 02:00:20.050]  I mean, I could see that,
[02:00:20.050 --> 02:00:21.370]  like why you'd wanna breed that out,
[02:00:21.370 --> 02:00:23.530]  especially if you're growing fiber.
[02:00:23.530 --> 02:00:27.250]  I mean, half of your plant is not there.
[02:00:33.860 --> 02:00:34.980]  That's, yeah, fascinating.
[02:00:34.980 --> 02:00:37.140]  It's probably something I should look into.
[02:00:40.060 --> 02:00:46.400]  So why don't we can show some mercy on you guys.
[02:00:46.440 --> 02:00:48.560]  We can come back and hit,
[02:00:48.560 --> 02:00:50.680]  we can just scroll through your Instagram
[02:00:50.680 --> 02:00:53.380]  and see what contentious topics we wanna hit.
[02:00:57.280 --> 02:00:59.160]  Is this a good two hours?
[02:00:59.160 --> 02:01:01.960]  Is that a good end point for today?
[02:01:02.960 --> 02:01:03.780]  Yeah.
[02:01:03.780 --> 02:01:05.480]  Floyd, do you have another two hours in you?
[02:01:05.480 --> 02:01:09.360]  Dude, no, I think two hours is a good time slot.
[02:01:09.360 --> 02:01:11.160]  I think that's probably, you know,
[02:01:11.160 --> 02:01:12.120]  I think we covered a lot.
[02:01:12.120 --> 02:01:13.720]  I mean, dude, I would love to do it again though.
[02:01:13.720 --> 02:01:15.480]  I mean, we could cover, you know,
[02:01:15.600 --> 02:01:19.040]  really anything I think.
[02:01:19.040 --> 02:01:19.880]  I think-
[02:01:19.880 --> 02:01:20.800]  Okay, so in the chat,
[02:01:20.800 --> 02:01:23.760]  would you guys like to see these guys chop it up again
[02:01:25.360 --> 02:01:27.020]  on a recurring basis?
[02:01:35.220 --> 02:01:36.920]  Or are we too boring?
[02:01:41.340 --> 02:01:44.620]  Yeah, no, I think my next controversial topic,
[02:01:44.620 --> 02:01:46.540]  I'm trying to put some little more data behind me
[02:01:46.540 --> 02:01:47.380]  before I put it out there,
[02:01:47.380 --> 02:01:50.140]  but I wanna talk about how plants preying up
[02:01:50.140 --> 02:01:51.300]  is not a good thing,
[02:01:51.300 --> 02:01:53.340]  which I think that's gonna ruffle some feathers
[02:01:53.340 --> 02:01:54.660]  in the community.
[02:01:54.660 --> 02:01:56.500]  But I'd love to talk about that.
[02:01:56.500 --> 02:01:57.340]  Yeah, interesting.
[02:01:57.340 --> 02:01:59.180]  We got one vote of no confidence,
[02:01:59.180 --> 02:02:00.540]  but we got a whole lot of-
[02:02:00.540 --> 02:02:02.140]  No.
[02:02:02.140 --> 02:02:02.980]  To be fair.
[02:02:02.980 --> 02:02:03.940]  Yeah, we got a whole lot.
[02:02:03.940 --> 02:02:04.780]  Yeah.
[02:02:04.780 --> 02:02:06.300]  I wanna just show all the positives.
[02:02:06.300 --> 02:02:07.140]  There you go.
[02:02:07.140 --> 02:02:09.180]  You gotta take this out with a sweet.
[02:02:09.180 --> 02:02:10.620]  You gotta keep it real.
[02:02:10.620 --> 02:02:11.460]  Yeah.
[02:02:13.060 --> 02:02:16.100]  And look at that, we haven't gotten all caps.
[02:02:16.100 --> 02:02:16.940]  There we go.
[02:02:16.940 --> 02:02:19.500]  The chat's always talking in all caps.
[02:02:23.710 --> 02:02:27.270]  Yeah, and I mean, even getting some other perspectives
[02:02:27.270 --> 02:02:28.190]  on here too, I think.
[02:02:28.190 --> 02:02:30.510]  I mean, you can cover a lot of ground with two people.
[02:02:30.510 --> 02:02:32.670]  I mean, it's, you know, so.
[02:02:34.670 --> 02:02:39.670]  This is, so, and I don't know if anyone with kids
[02:02:41.270 --> 02:02:43.910]  or not kids, if you watch this movie,
[02:02:43.910 --> 02:02:46.390]  but the emoji movie.
[02:02:46.390 --> 02:02:47.230]  Oh yeah.
[02:02:47.230 --> 02:02:50.430]  Yeah, the emoji that's meh.
[02:02:50.470 --> 02:02:53.430]  This is the meh emoji.
[02:02:55.150 --> 02:02:55.990]  Why not?
[02:02:58.890 --> 02:03:03.890]  All right, well, on behalf of the 200 and something people
[02:03:03.970 --> 02:03:07.090]  who are currently watching, oh, and I love if you,
[02:03:08.010 --> 02:03:11.450]  by the way, as another public service announcement,
[02:03:11.450 --> 02:03:12.810]  cause it was asked to get in the chat,
[02:03:12.810 --> 02:03:15.850]  this is not the same crap king as the crap king
[02:03:15.850 --> 02:03:17.410]  scene company.
[02:03:17.410 --> 02:03:18.690]  And as I said in the chat,
[02:03:18.690 --> 02:03:20.370]  it's like the dude in office space,
[02:03:20.410 --> 02:03:22.770]  whose name happens to also be Michael Bolton.
[02:03:22.770 --> 02:03:23.610]  Right.
[02:03:23.610 --> 02:03:26.610]  And then some asshole named Michael Bolton
[02:03:26.610 --> 02:03:27.970]  makes shitty music.
[02:03:28.850 --> 02:03:31.810]  I know, I just need to make like a beanie, not them.
[02:03:31.810 --> 02:03:35.250]  Yeah, not cropping, not cropping seeds.
[02:03:35.250 --> 02:03:36.090]  Right.
[02:03:37.210 --> 02:03:39.850]  Yeah, and if you wanna, I mean, actually,
[02:03:39.850 --> 02:03:41.890]  I'm giving out a lot of seeds right now.
[02:03:41.890 --> 02:03:44.370]  If you ever wanna send seeds in for me to give out
[02:03:44.370 --> 02:03:47.330]  to people, I give out a lot of Floyd seeds.
[02:03:47.850 --> 02:03:49.890]  Yeah, I could send some.
[02:03:49.890 --> 02:03:53.570]  I'm like, you wanna grow the hypey shit,
[02:03:53.570 --> 02:03:58.570]  but here's some high CBG type three.
[02:04:00.610 --> 02:04:02.930]  Stuff to explore too.
[02:04:02.930 --> 02:04:04.490]  That's one of my goals in February.
[02:04:04.490 --> 02:04:06.130]  We're gonna get you all restocked
[02:04:06.130 --> 02:04:07.930]  with a bunch of THC rich stuff
[02:04:07.930 --> 02:04:11.130]  and then restock the CBD, CBG.
[02:04:11.130 --> 02:04:12.930]  I'll have a bunch of freebies and stuff too.
[02:04:12.930 --> 02:04:16.330]  So yeah, no, I'd say, I think you're,
[02:04:17.330 --> 02:04:20.530]  you know, besides you and then a regenerative Dutch Blooms
[02:04:20.530 --> 02:04:22.410]  up there in Bellingham, I think you're the only two
[02:04:22.410 --> 02:04:26.170]  that really stock my seeds other than our personal website.
[02:04:26.170 --> 02:04:29.450]  So I appreciate that, but no, I love what you guys do,
[02:04:29.450 --> 02:04:33.290]  Peter, with the Future Cannabis Project and Dog of Love.
[02:04:33.290 --> 02:04:37.170]  Like, yeah, I'll support you as long as I can, man.
[02:04:37.170 --> 02:04:40.250]  I think this is a not crafting.
[02:04:40.250 --> 02:04:42.450]  Yeah, difference.
[02:04:43.450 --> 02:04:48.110]  So, all right, with that,
[02:04:48.110 --> 02:04:49.510]  and I think if I remember,
[02:04:49.510 --> 02:04:52.950]  we got some worm conversations coming up tomorrow,
[02:04:52.950 --> 02:04:54.550]  right, Rodden?
[02:04:54.550 --> 02:04:57.470]  And then we have some psychedelic conversations
[02:04:57.470 --> 02:04:59.270]  and DP's still lingering.
[02:05:00.110 --> 02:05:03.070]  And there he is.
[02:05:03.070 --> 02:05:05.310]  Do we have a psychedelic conversation?
[02:05:06.590 --> 02:05:08.750]  Let me actually just quickly throw,
[02:05:10.030 --> 02:05:13.350]  if people are like, where is that happening?
[02:05:13.350 --> 02:05:17.630]  Tomorrow, 8 p.m. Eastern time over on the Psychonauts TV,
[02:05:19.150 --> 02:05:20.950]  YouTube channel that Peter created.
[02:05:21.950 --> 02:05:23.550]  So if you're interested,
[02:05:23.550 --> 02:05:26.710]  just go click on that link and subscribe.
[02:05:26.710 --> 02:05:29.430]  And cause that's where all the,
[02:05:29.430 --> 02:05:32.470]  not just psilocybin, but other,
[02:05:34.270 --> 02:05:37.750]  I guess cannabis is also mine, other mine.
[02:05:37.750 --> 02:05:41.390]  Dude, if you take a,
[02:05:41.390 --> 02:05:43.190]  if you take high enough doses of RSO,
[02:05:44.030 --> 02:05:46.790]  you can definitely have a psychedelic trip for sure.
[02:05:46.790 --> 02:05:49.990]  That's, yeah, you're right.
[02:05:49.990 --> 02:05:51.670]  Yeah, 100%, man.
[02:05:51.670 --> 02:05:54.150]  Anything over like a gram and a half, two grams,
[02:05:54.150 --> 02:05:56.310]  yeah, you're getting in that realm, yeah.
[02:05:56.310 --> 02:05:57.910]  Yeah, yeah, sure.
[02:05:57.910 --> 02:05:58.750]  Yeah.
[02:05:59.590 --> 02:06:04.590]  So Gorski, you didn't necessarily need to take all of them,
[02:06:04.710 --> 02:06:09.710]  or no, sorry, those .25s were a little bit more.
[02:06:09.750 --> 02:06:10.670]  What?
[02:06:10.670 --> 02:06:12.230]  Well, how many did you take?
[02:06:12.230 --> 02:06:13.350]  Did you take all of them?
[02:06:13.350 --> 02:06:15.950]  Because all of them was a hero dose.
[02:06:15.950 --> 02:06:18.430]  All of them was four grams in total.
[02:06:18.430 --> 02:06:21.430]  Yeah, he took 20 of the .25s.
[02:06:23.430 --> 02:06:24.270]  I would be interested.
[02:06:24.270 --> 02:06:27.470]  Even .5 on some, some people are a little bit more,
[02:06:27.470 --> 02:06:29.310]  and depending what you eat as well,
[02:06:29.310 --> 02:06:31.510]  you can kick in the psilocin a little bit faster
[02:06:31.510 --> 02:06:33.150]  and harder on you.
[02:06:33.150 --> 02:06:34.670]  Yeah, vitamin C or something.
[02:06:34.670 --> 02:06:35.910]  Yeah, no, the empty stomach.
[02:06:35.910 --> 02:06:39.270]  Yeah, no, I've had some, yeah, on low doses, yeah.
[02:06:39.270 --> 02:06:40.310]  Yeah, I've gotten to work and I'm like,
[02:06:40.710 --> 02:06:42.550]  this is not a micro, that's for sure.
[02:06:43.670 --> 02:06:44.510]  Oops.
[02:06:45.750 --> 02:06:48.630]  Yeah, so Gorski, I took one of them.
[02:06:48.630 --> 02:06:49.470]  What?
[02:06:49.470 --> 02:06:52.790]  Okay, so only one pill, that'd be .25.
[02:06:56.850 --> 02:06:57.690]  Okay.
[02:06:57.690 --> 02:06:59.130]  Yeah.
[02:06:59.130 --> 02:07:02.170]  You can work your way up to two, two pills.
[02:07:02.170 --> 02:07:04.690]  That'd be half of one gram.
[02:07:07.290 --> 02:07:08.490]  For sure.
[02:07:08.490 --> 02:07:11.610]  Yeah, I'm psyched to explore all sorts
[02:07:11.610 --> 02:07:15.330]  of different strains of psilocybin.
[02:07:15.330 --> 02:07:18.930]  Yeah, that's the next, that's the next big one, right?
[02:07:18.930 --> 02:07:20.010]  The next big wave.
[02:07:21.930 --> 02:07:22.770]  Yeah.
[02:07:22.770 --> 02:07:24.050]  But just to kind of see how different,
[02:07:24.050 --> 02:07:26.770]  so like I had, you know, for me, and you know,
[02:07:26.770 --> 02:07:29.090]  again, it's different people have different reactions
[02:07:29.090 --> 02:07:30.130]  and like different things.
[02:07:30.130 --> 02:07:34.690]  So for me, I like the albino Pino Sedvi,
[02:07:34.690 --> 02:07:37.290]  I like the albino Golden Teacher.
[02:07:38.890 --> 02:07:41.250]  The micro, for micro dosing?
[02:07:41.250 --> 02:07:43.250]  Or just for in general?
[02:07:43.250 --> 02:07:47.690]  Yeah, I was doing all different dosing sizes.
[02:07:47.690 --> 02:07:52.010]  And, but the, like, for example, for me personally,
[02:07:52.010 --> 02:07:57.010]  the Thai elephant dung kind of just made me sleepy
[02:07:59.490 --> 02:08:02.130]  or just like, like almost like a diesel,
[02:08:02.130 --> 02:08:05.530]  like a slow diesel engine.
[02:08:08.570 --> 02:08:10.570]  But I don't think I tried that one
[02:08:10.570 --> 02:08:13.290]  at like three or four grams.
[02:08:14.170 --> 02:08:16.570]  Because also taking them as little capsules,
[02:08:16.570 --> 02:08:21.570]  it's like, it's like they all get stuck in your throat.
[02:08:24.050 --> 02:08:28.890]  So I'd like to, I'd rather have extracted product
[02:08:28.890 --> 02:08:30.850]  eventually, like little chocolate bars.
[02:08:31.690 --> 02:08:34.970]  Oh yeah, chocolates are, yeah, chocolates are easy.
[02:08:34.970 --> 02:08:35.810]  These are great.
[02:08:35.810 --> 02:08:36.650]  What do you got there?
[02:08:36.770 --> 02:08:41.090]  It's just a ground up gram of albino Pino Sedvi.
[02:08:41.090 --> 02:08:42.610]  Just mix it in a drink?
[02:08:42.610 --> 02:08:46.570]  Yeah, throw it in some, like some lemon juice
[02:08:46.570 --> 02:08:48.410]  and kick it in super quick, super hard.
[02:08:48.410 --> 02:08:51.610]  It's not gonna be a six hour event for you.
[02:08:51.610 --> 02:08:53.290]  You know, you should be able to snap back
[02:08:53.290 --> 02:08:54.610]  24 or five hours.
[02:08:55.810 --> 02:08:58.210]  Yeah, I think grinding it up is essential, right?
[02:08:58.210 --> 02:09:02.490]  I mean, yeah, it makes it a little easier to digest.
[02:09:02.490 --> 02:09:03.330]  That's cool though.
[02:09:03.330 --> 02:09:04.530]  I think that'll be an interesting conversation.
[02:09:04.570 --> 02:09:06.610]  Who do you guys got, have it on for that?
[02:09:07.810 --> 02:09:11.090]  We have Tanazi from Sacred Three Mushrooms.
[02:09:11.090 --> 02:09:16.090]  He's sponsoring it and guiding us through home cultivation.
[02:09:17.210 --> 02:09:19.450]  You know, the basics of starting a kit and stuff like that.
[02:09:19.450 --> 02:09:22.330]  So tomorrow we'll actually be inoculating our own grain.
[02:09:23.330 --> 02:09:25.370]  We have a kit over there on Dagadagarden
[02:09:25.370 --> 02:09:27.530]  that people are available to go grab
[02:09:27.530 --> 02:09:29.250]  and join along with us.
[02:09:30.210 --> 02:09:32.850]  Green Table Gardens, he's huge in our chat.
[02:09:32.890 --> 02:09:35.010]  He's not big on Instagram or anything,
[02:09:35.010 --> 02:09:36.890]  which I respect highly.
[02:09:36.890 --> 02:09:38.610]  He's gonna be there guiding us as well.
[02:09:38.610 --> 02:09:41.090]  He's a pretty accomplished mycologist.
[02:09:41.090 --> 02:09:43.530]  So obviously, yeah, we're excited.
[02:09:43.530 --> 02:09:44.370]  Cool, man.
[02:09:44.370 --> 02:09:45.850]  Yeah, that's super cool.
[02:09:47.130 --> 02:09:48.090]  Well, right on.
[02:09:48.090 --> 02:09:50.250]  Yeah, no, I think that would be even fun too.
[02:09:50.250 --> 02:09:52.410]  Like, yeah, I think tutorials and stuff like that.
[02:09:52.410 --> 02:09:53.610]  I mean, just getting information out.
[02:09:53.610 --> 02:09:55.290]  I mean, that's the cool thing about this platform
[02:09:55.290 --> 02:09:57.770]  is like, I mean, the knowledge that you guys are spreading
[02:09:57.770 --> 02:09:59.130]  is pretty sweet, so.
[02:09:59.130 --> 02:09:59.970]  For sure.
[02:10:00.850 --> 02:10:02.770]  But yeah, guys, it was fucking awesome.
[02:10:03.650 --> 02:10:07.130]  Appreciate your time, Colin, and dude, yeah.
[02:10:07.130 --> 02:10:08.050]  Absolutely.
[02:10:08.050 --> 02:10:08.890]  Anytime.
[02:10:08.890 --> 02:10:10.130]  And I thought I saw you mention
[02:10:10.130 --> 02:10:11.650]  you guys might be starting a podcast,
[02:10:11.650 --> 02:10:13.170]  or you might be starting a podcast too.
[02:10:13.170 --> 02:10:14.370]  Is that happening still, or?
[02:10:14.370 --> 02:10:15.490]  Yeah, we're toying around.
[02:10:15.490 --> 02:10:17.250]  Just because, like I said, I took winter off.
[02:10:17.250 --> 02:10:19.410]  The greenhouse is empty the first time in 10 years.
[02:10:19.410 --> 02:10:22.570]  So I have this kind of free time.
[02:10:23.770 --> 02:10:25.050]  Right, well, hey, yeah.
[02:10:25.050 --> 02:10:26.970]  We come with an audience.
[02:10:26.970 --> 02:10:28.290]  Dude, that's what I'm saying.
[02:10:28.290 --> 02:10:31.370]  Like, I kind of thought about the idea too,
[02:10:31.370 --> 02:10:34.450]  and it's like the fact that the infrastructure's here,
[02:10:34.450 --> 02:10:37.490]  the audience is here, and just, you know,
[02:10:37.490 --> 02:10:40.770]  yeah, it's an awesome community, so.
[02:10:40.770 --> 02:10:42.370]  Yeah, and I think the conversation,
[02:10:42.370 --> 02:10:43.210]  at least that I have in mind,
[02:10:43.210 --> 02:10:45.810]  would be kind of like what today was, you know?
[02:10:45.810 --> 02:10:48.770]  Bring some experience and try and bring some of the science
[02:10:48.770 --> 02:10:51.130]  in it without it sounding like a lecture.
[02:10:51.130 --> 02:10:54.650]  You know, have a little more anecdote, but yeah.
[02:10:54.650 --> 02:10:55.490]  Well, and that's right.
[02:10:55.490 --> 02:10:57.930]  Dude, I can always use more science.
[02:10:57.930 --> 02:10:59.410]  Like, you know, I'm more like,
[02:10:59.410 --> 02:11:01.650]  I've kind of learned just by trial and error
[02:11:01.650 --> 02:11:03.970]  and figured out what works, and it's, you know,
[02:11:03.970 --> 02:11:07.370]  and so, but like any time you can layer on, you know,
[02:11:07.370 --> 02:11:09.010]  the, you know, kind of, like you said,
[02:11:09.010 --> 02:11:12.330]  the science or the deeper understanding behind it,
[02:11:12.330 --> 02:11:15.650]  it's just more, you know, more knowledge, so.
[02:11:15.650 --> 02:11:16.490]  Absolutely.
[02:11:16.490 --> 02:11:17.930]  And yeah, I hope, you know,
[02:11:17.930 --> 02:11:20.090]  like I try not to be just surface level and everything.
[02:11:20.090 --> 02:11:21.650]  Like, hopefully we got, you know,
[02:11:21.650 --> 02:11:23.410]  we peeled back some layers
[02:11:23.410 --> 02:11:25.410]  and kind of got deeper on certain topics,
[02:11:25.410 --> 02:11:29.490]  but I mean, you know, that is an open-ended question.
[02:11:29.490 --> 02:11:30.490]  So yeah.
[02:11:30.490 --> 02:11:31.410]  Right.
[02:11:31.410 --> 02:11:34.170]  Yeah, and a lot of this is just opinions and-
[02:11:34.170 --> 02:11:35.010]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:11:35.010 --> 02:11:36.250]  Kind of based on experience and where we come from.
[02:11:36.250 --> 02:11:39.290]  There's obviously a few things that are mathematical
[02:11:39.290 --> 02:11:40.730]  in the sense of there is a right answer,
[02:11:40.730 --> 02:11:42.890]  but then a lot of it is, it's very,
[02:11:42.890 --> 02:11:45.410]  you know, in plant research in general, you know,
[02:11:45.410 --> 02:11:46.970]  when we were working with Mammoth P
[02:11:46.970 --> 02:11:48.570]  and creating new formulas and stuff,
[02:11:48.570 --> 02:11:50.730]  there's so many variables that-
[02:11:50.730 --> 02:11:51.570]  Oh yeah.
[02:11:51.570 --> 02:11:52.730]  It was hard for us to figure out, all right,
[02:11:52.730 --> 02:11:55.250]  this consortium bacteria is doing this.
[02:11:55.250 --> 02:11:56.090]  Why?
[02:11:56.090 --> 02:11:58.050]  Like, is it because of the new, I mean, there's so many,
[02:11:58.050 --> 02:11:59.930]  because even in the greenhouse, we have 10 degree swings.
[02:11:59.930 --> 02:12:03.170]  And so yeah, there's a lot of ambiguity in research.
[02:12:03.170 --> 02:12:05.090]  And so talking about it and kind of highlighting
[02:12:05.090 --> 02:12:07.690]  some of those things is I think super important.
[02:12:07.690 --> 02:12:10.010]  Yeah, I think the microbe stuff is super interesting.
[02:12:10.010 --> 02:12:12.650]  The only thing that I've ever noticed a huge difference
[02:12:12.650 --> 02:12:14.730]  is like direct mycorrhizae application
[02:12:14.730 --> 02:12:16.210]  to the roots at transplant.
[02:12:16.210 --> 02:12:17.770]  And that's, you know, if I'm going to spend money
[02:12:17.770 --> 02:12:19.250]  on anything, that's what I do.
[02:12:19.250 --> 02:12:20.890]  No watering in or anything like that.
[02:12:21.890 --> 02:12:23.930]  But yeah, there's a ton of science behind that.
[02:12:23.930 --> 02:12:26.210]  But yeah, no, that's fascinating.
[02:12:26.210 --> 02:12:29.490]  So it's all interesting, but all right, guys.
[02:12:29.490 --> 02:12:30.330]  Cool.
[02:12:30.330 --> 02:12:31.330]  I think I'm going to peace out.
[02:12:31.330 --> 02:12:32.490]  It was a good conversation.
[02:12:32.490 --> 02:12:33.770]  Hopefully everybody else enjoyed it.
[02:12:33.770 --> 02:12:36.570]  And yeah, I mean, if you can find us at, you know,
[02:12:36.570 --> 02:12:38.130]  I'm on Instagram at Hoku Seed Co.
[02:12:38.130 --> 02:12:41.450]  And then just our website, hokuseedco.com.
[02:12:41.450 --> 02:12:43.730]  And then Peter's going to have a bunch of new gear
[02:12:43.730 --> 02:12:45.970]  here shortly up on Dog of Love.
[02:12:47.890 --> 02:12:48.810]  Cool. Yeah.
[02:12:48.810 --> 02:12:50.970]  And I guess you can find me at Instagram,
[02:12:50.970 --> 02:12:53.170]  Crop King Colin, or, and then all the flower
[02:12:53.170 --> 02:12:56.370]  that we sell and release,
[02:12:56.370 --> 02:12:58.890]  all the CP products are Neverwinter Botanicals.
[02:12:59.810 --> 02:13:00.650]  Cool.
[02:13:01.650 --> 02:13:02.690]  All right, guys.
[02:13:02.690 --> 02:13:04.810]  You guys have a good rest of your day, man.
[02:13:04.810 --> 02:13:05.650]  Cool.
[02:13:05.650 --> 02:13:06.690]  I'll talk to you guys later.
[02:13:06.690 --> 02:13:07.930]  Thanks everyone.
[02:13:07.930 --> 02:13:08.770]  See you guys.
[02:13:08.770 --> 02:13:10.370]  I hope you feel that broadcast.
