[00:02.810 --> 00:09.570]  All right, we are live. Welcome everyone. We are here this morning with
[00:09.570 --> 00:14.090]  Mandalorian Genetics and what's the buy full duplex? Do you go buy full
[00:14.090 --> 00:20.170]  duplex? I do. It's a monitor I've used for quite some time. Got it.
[00:20.170 --> 00:27.970]  And there's Josh getting ready for his morning poo with his coffee and weed.
[00:27.970 --> 00:32.770]  I've had to step out. Well, I already got mine out of the way.
[00:32.770 --> 00:40.290]  Yeah, I am, as the sun does rise in the east every morning, I am very regular.
[00:40.290 --> 00:47.970]  Yes. So a little too much information for everyone watching, but anyway, why don't
[00:47.970 --> 00:52.890]  Josh, why don't you want to set the table and kind of introduce everyone to
[00:52.890 --> 00:58.290]  Dan and then maybe let Dan take over and talk about himself. I got this cool
[00:58.290 --> 01:08.680]  screen with the smoke and this light. It's making me feel really badass. Yeah,
[01:08.680 --> 01:18.060]  I am a year and a half ago-ish when I was up at Shangolosis deal. I was
[01:18.060 --> 01:21.480]  speaking at the, what was it called there, the thing he was doing? I'm
[01:21.720 --> 01:27.880]  blanking right now. It's a Veeam event. It's based upon the, you know, it's a
[01:27.880 --> 01:34.920]  med grouping over on the island that he puts on his shows. Thank you. Yeah, so we
[01:34.920 --> 01:39.520]  were just actually standing in the parking lot and I get my little breakfast.
[01:41.360 --> 01:45.440]  Yeah, my wife did not make me breakfast this morning.
[01:46.800 --> 01:51.320]  That's, my wife doesn't help with the garden, but she keeps me fueled and takes
[01:51.320 --> 01:55.800]  care of our son. So I don't talk a lot about my family and stuff, but they're
[01:55.800 --> 01:59.800]  kind of, they support me in other ways, you know, rather than being in the garden.
[02:00.320 --> 02:04.160]  But we were all there, my wife, my son, and I was going to speak at the Vimeo
[02:04.160 --> 02:11.760]  event and we were all there early hanging out, having some snacks and dancing. And
[02:12.000 --> 02:14.680]  we just started talking and I was like, what are you into? And he's like, I'm in
[02:14.680 --> 02:18.360]  Dotto's. I'm like, okay. You know, so I was still kind of in that like, all right,
[02:18.360 --> 02:22.920]  this guy might be a little crazy mode. And then he started talking more and I
[02:22.920 --> 02:27.080]  just kept asking questions. And after 10 minutes, I was like, fuck, this guy is,
[02:27.480 --> 02:30.800]  knows his shit. This is really interesting. He's been working on this for a while.
[02:30.800 --> 02:34.120]  This might not be, you know, the same kind of thought pattern that we've all been
[02:34.120 --> 02:38.560]  through. This might not be the same thing. And so we started talking more and then I
[02:38.560 --> 02:41.800]  invited him to come hang out for a weekend and we hung out and he camped at my
[02:41.800 --> 02:47.600]  property and we just kind of dreamed about the potential of what he was doing
[02:47.600 --> 02:53.680]  with auto flowers and mixing it with hemp and photo periods. And since then, we've
[02:53.680 --> 02:57.200]  just become really good friends and we kind of think a lot alike and we like to, we
[02:57.200 --> 03:01.960]  enjoy cooking meat together and barbecuing and all this shit. And I've just been
[03:01.960 --> 03:07.960]  really, really impressed with the depth of knowledge that Dan has. There's a lot of
[03:07.960 --> 03:15.240]  guys doing auto and one of the guys pushed the scene to a new level. And it's
[03:15.240 --> 03:18.360]  really just because he's been at it for a while. He's been working, you know, over 10
[03:18.360 --> 03:23.240]  years, he's been working with autos. And the cool thing, one cool thing that he does
[03:23.240 --> 03:29.120]  is he doesn't really, he has yet to release a feminized line, which I think is
[03:29.120 --> 03:35.040]  really awesome. You know, like some people dog on the idea of, you know, buying autos
[03:35.040 --> 03:39.640]  where it's, you know, feminized only because they think maybe the breeder is trying to
[03:39.680 --> 03:44.400]  hold their genetics. But there's a lot of different ways to think about it. You know, I
[03:44.440 --> 03:47.960]  think that a lot of folks want, want feminized for certain reasons, you know,
[03:47.960 --> 03:52.720]  because they don't have to sit the males. And I think that potentially the breeders, you
[03:52.720 --> 03:55.800]  know, do have that, you know, why I don't want to release this thing because if I
[03:55.800 --> 04:00.160]  release a male and female auto line, then anybody, any breeder can just take my shit
[04:00.280 --> 04:05.480]  and do it. And that's what Dan's doing without fear. And I really respect that about
[04:05.480 --> 04:10.360]  Dan. He's like, I don't give a fuck. I'm not nervous about this. So I've been making
[04:10.480 --> 04:15.680]  it. And it's the highest THC I'm doing. And fucking here you go. It's seventh
[04:15.680 --> 04:19.920]  generation have at it, you know? So I just think you got a lot of character, Dan, you're
[04:19.920 --> 04:24.320]  doing some real cool stuff. And I'm pretty thankful to know you. And I think everybody
[04:24.320 --> 04:28.640]  on here is going to have a good show listening to what you got. So with that, I'll
[04:28.640 --> 04:29.760]  give it, turn it over to you, bro.
[04:30.600 --> 04:33.480]  Hey, man. Well, I appreciate it. I really appreciate your kind words as always, you
[04:33.480 --> 04:37.000]  know, and yeah, you know, just like you said, I've been working with him for 10
[04:37.000 --> 04:42.400]  years. I got started way back. Forum days, obviously, before we had these kind of
[04:42.400 --> 04:45.920]  platforms to discuss and talk to each other and way before I could ever imagine
[04:46.240 --> 04:51.000]  walking into an event and having a couple hundred people, you know, standing around
[04:51.000 --> 04:53.920]  tailgates, sharing flowers that they've grown from the season and exchanging
[04:53.920 --> 04:57.920]  knowledge, you know, so it's kind of been interesting to step into that light. Yeah,
[04:57.920 --> 05:03.200]  we've been working on, like I said, for 10 years, and I don't fear releasing regs.
[05:03.600 --> 05:06.600]  One of the things is, you know, we all get better, we can go together. And I think
[05:06.600 --> 05:12.520]  people learn and differently. So giving people the ability to dabble with, you
[05:12.520 --> 05:16.880]  know, regular seeds, given people the ability to be self sufficient, too, is also
[05:16.880 --> 05:21.000]  key for me. I got a huge heart for patients as well. And you know, I do a lot of
[05:21.000 --> 05:24.880]  donating through the Vashon Island events and through Django and Django has kind of
[05:24.880 --> 05:28.800]  opened up that gateway for me, you know, let me meet you. And yeah, we hit it off
[05:28.800 --> 05:35.120]  real great. The seventh generation autos are, you know, stability has always been my
[05:35.120 --> 05:41.680]  key. I want, I wanted people to get what they saw. A lot of people were dogging autos
[05:41.680 --> 05:46.280]  for a very long time. They still dog on autos. And the main reason being they don't
[05:46.280 --> 05:49.560]  think they have high potency. But, you know, to me, it's never really been about
[05:49.560 --> 05:52.920]  high potency. It's been about the synergy of the cannabinoids and the terpenes and
[05:52.920 --> 05:56.360]  everything that's, you know, just inside that plant. And why not have it at a
[05:56.360 --> 06:01.080]  quicker turnaround time? Some of the stuff that I've won awards with, you know,
[06:01.080 --> 06:05.560]  turns around in 60 days, you get the ability to have your own homegrown flower or
[06:05.560 --> 06:09.320]  even for commercial market, you know, to backfill their mom rooms or things of that
[06:09.320 --> 06:12.680]  nature with extra weight, maybe for extraction or whole flower, you know,
[06:13.040 --> 06:17.600]  sales. So that brings me to the point was like, you know, you said some farmers like
[06:17.600 --> 06:21.600]  feminized seed process easier because it's less for overhead time. And I agree with
[06:21.600 --> 06:25.800]  that. And I want to start going down that road. But I think stability was my main
[06:25.800 --> 06:31.200]  key and my primary focus of my first releases. I didn't release until to the
[06:31.960 --> 06:36.760]  excuse me, to the public until about I think two years ago now. It was actually a year
[06:36.760 --> 06:41.000]  before we met Josh that they are actually able to get out on the market. And then, you
[06:41.000 --> 06:43.640]  know, I've got a few stable lines that don't stay on the shelves. I work with several
[06:43.640 --> 06:48.800]  seed banks here in the US and one in Australia now, too, actually. Of course, you
[06:48.800 --> 06:53.960]  know, Josh, one of yours is one of the banks is yours. And I work with DCC Exchange.
[06:53.960 --> 06:57.760]  Fortunate enough to be picked up by Hemorrhage Genetics Collection. And it looks
[06:57.760 --> 07:03.320]  like we're going to be seeing the seed seller as well out of Michigan. I've worked
[07:03.320 --> 07:06.560]  with organally seeds. And so there's many avenues you can get your hands on them. And
[07:06.560 --> 07:10.240]  especially like if you're in a farming in the I-502, you know, Josh and I have worked
[07:10.240 --> 07:14.400]  together to get a program together to get these farms access to larger scale amounts
[07:14.400 --> 07:20.720]  of seeds because they want to do it. And I think it's there's a wave that's riding
[07:20.720 --> 07:26.360]  right now with autos when it comes to the home grow. You got people from Michigan and
[07:26.360 --> 07:31.720]  all over the place. And we've got what, five more legal states, I think. On Wednesday,
[07:31.720 --> 07:34.520]  they called it, they finally did. So, you know, it's going to be coming to boom and
[07:34.520 --> 07:38.160]  it's something that's easy for a person who's never grown for the first time. And
[07:38.160 --> 07:44.200]  it's also beneficial for somebody who's, you know, looking for the commercial scale.
[07:44.200 --> 07:49.960]  I started off with my autos with majority of my original genetics were from Spain. They
[07:49.960 --> 07:57.080]  were way ahead of anybody else for the longest time. And the base of my stock came from a
[07:57.080 --> 08:00.520]  breeder named Mossy. She was an underground breeder for such a long time. She's been on
[08:00.520 --> 08:04.760]  the forums. There's been a lot of people that have seen her. I met up with her and a few
[08:04.760 --> 08:09.640]  other gentlemen and we built the Autoflower Network. And for the longest time, that's
[08:09.640 --> 08:14.120]  where I could show my work, show what I was doing, show the stability coming out on the
[08:14.120 --> 08:19.400]  cross, just showing the changes that I was making. So I think between having the knowledge
[08:19.400 --> 08:23.240]  and then once I got my breakout with ECC to exchange, people were able to grow them.
[08:23.240 --> 08:28.360]  I think it's what really skyrocketed me because I came into it with having years of experience
[08:28.360 --> 08:32.600]  to back it up and point people in a direction and say, Hey, look, I'm not just talking about
[08:32.600 --> 08:35.600]  this. I'm not just trying to blow smoke up your rear end. Here's what I've done. And
[08:35.600 --> 08:39.920]  then you can actually go see it and see the progress that's been made. They've come a
[08:39.920 --> 08:47.320]  long way from breeder Alice. They've come a long way from just being a auto flowering
[08:47.320 --> 08:51.160]  plant or their own style of hybrid. We're seeing a lot of changes in them. We're seeing
[08:51.160 --> 08:57.360]  a lot of structural changes, but the leaf ratio changes, THC contents increasing, leaf
[08:57.360 --> 09:03.560]  to bud ratio is getting better and just an all around quality product. And I think it's
[09:03.560 --> 09:07.080]  a time where they're really going to take off for everybody. You see this legalization
[09:07.080 --> 09:10.320]  move and Josh, you and I were talking the other night and I think even Jeff Lohenfels
[09:10.320 --> 09:14.240]  has said this multiple times, like eventually you're going to walk into like Home Depot
[09:14.240 --> 09:19.360]  or Lowe's and you'd be able to find auto flower seeds, especially as legalization progresses
[09:19.360 --> 09:23.080]  forward. And it's kind of fun to help educate people with that. And my biggest thing is
[09:23.080 --> 09:30.160]  education. I like to talk to people. I like to help them get motivated and excited about
[09:30.160 --> 09:34.920]  growing them and, you know, help them miss the errors that I made at the beginning because
[09:34.920 --> 09:40.400]  sometimes they can be difficult because they do have finicky root structures. They don't
[09:40.400 --> 09:43.400]  like a lot of stress. The beautiful thing is you pretty much avoid any kind of light
[09:43.440 --> 09:46.920]  stressors growing them, but there are other stressors that you have to run into that could
[09:46.920 --> 09:53.680]  potentially impact your yield. So my breeding technique for this ability was also to eliminate
[09:53.680 --> 09:59.240]  this, like the guesswork and the inability to grow them easily. That way, if somebody
[09:59.240 --> 10:02.320]  does make a mistake, it's not going to stunt their plan out and they get this nice little
[10:02.320 --> 10:08.200]  lollipop bud the size of a stick with a tiny bud on it. So that's a little bit of my background
[10:08.200 --> 10:17.420]  there and what I'm looking for.
[10:17.420 --> 10:24.700]  I was going to comment on the commercial viability. You touched on it. But I think there's like
[10:24.700 --> 10:31.500]  three or four 502 farms, which is the recreational, you know, legal recreational in Washington
[10:31.500 --> 10:36.620]  State that are running your gear or have and are just raving. I think a couple of them
[10:36.620 --> 10:39.620]  are even breeding. They took the, I don't know, you can speak on it, but I think they
[10:39.620 --> 10:43.180]  took some of the stock or kind of keep going with it so they didn't have to buy more seeds,
[10:43.180 --> 10:47.820]  you know, and they're just like filling in their aisles and some people are starting
[10:47.820 --> 10:53.140]  whole greenhouses with it. They're so happy. Like there's a lot of, you know, there's just
[10:53.140 --> 10:55.620]  a lot going on and a lot of room to grow a lot of weed.
[10:55.620 --> 11:02.260]  Yeah. There's a lot of avenues that are showing up. You know, we got one of the, there's a
[11:02.260 --> 11:05.540]  huge farm here in Washington that picked me up most recently and they picked up my Bobby's
[11:05.540 --> 11:09.380]  Widow, which is 68 turnaround. And the main reason that they were interested is they have
[11:09.380 --> 11:15.900]  this massive veg space where they aren't using it in the wintertime because it seems
[11:15.900 --> 11:19.580]  like that veg space is primarily getting the clones ready for the big summer runs over
[11:19.580 --> 11:24.220]  in Eastern Washington. So having all that empty space and down, it's, you know, it's
[11:24.220 --> 11:28.140]  not technically losing money, but why not make money while you can inside there and
[11:28.140 --> 11:35.620]  use that space? And they grabbed 1500 of them from me and ran their veg space to, you know,
[11:35.860 --> 11:41.300]  kind of compensate and make up some extra weight during what some would consider a downtime.
[11:41.300 --> 11:47.580]  I've been lucky enough to have farms in Maine, Massachusetts, Vermont. I think there's a
[11:47.580 --> 11:53.820]  couple in Missouri. And I've talked to a few in Oklahoma and a few other locations too,
[11:53.820 --> 11:58.820]  but it's kind of nice. It's what I'm seeing is a semblance between our coast and our region
[11:58.820 --> 12:04.180]  here in Western Washington, where we have a very short season window. It's very similar
[12:04.180 --> 12:08.900]  to the New England side because we're kind of along that same hardiness line. So they're
[12:08.900 --> 12:13.700]  seeing the benefit to being able to get a crop out, potentially even two crops out while,
[12:13.700 --> 12:17.060]  you know, one early spring, and then they're running another alongside their long season
[12:17.060 --> 12:24.060]  grills. So it's real interesting to see how it's helping them leverage several options
[12:24.060 --> 12:28.190]  and stay afloat.
[12:28.190 --> 12:34.110]  Have you, in the last couple of years, have you had much opportunity to run anybody else's
[12:34.110 --> 12:38.710]  autos? Like I know you're really focused on your own work. It's probably hard to squeeze
[12:38.710 --> 12:42.430]  into space and time to check on anybody else, you know?
[12:42.430 --> 12:49.030]  Right. I mean, I haven't grown anybody else's in a couple of years now, especially two years.
[12:49.030 --> 12:54.310]  I do have some friends and a couple apprentices that have been running other gears to get,
[12:54.310 --> 12:57.750]  you know, well-rounded and growing the techniques because not everybody's plants are going to
[12:57.750 --> 13:03.350]  come out the same. And I do see some really nice stuff out there. Nite Owl Seeds is a
[13:03.350 --> 13:09.590]  great brand. You know, Daz is a friend and that's a great place to get some solid, solid
[13:09.590 --> 13:14.910]  feminized autos. Highly resinous. They get large. He's also in the commercial market
[13:14.910 --> 13:18.710]  too. I've seen hundreds of acres of his stuff grown. So if that's somebody else you want
[13:18.710 --> 13:22.870]  to check out because regular thing might scare you because you either don't want to hunt
[13:22.870 --> 13:27.350]  out a male or risk having a male hide on you and your crop. It's definitely somebody I
[13:27.350 --> 13:31.430]  would take my hat off to because he's been at it just as long as I've been at it. You
[13:31.430 --> 13:34.910]  know, I mean, this dude traveled to Spain to learn from some of the breeders over in
[13:34.910 --> 13:40.590]  Europe. So it was, you know, that's another good brand to grow.
[13:40.590 --> 13:44.430]  Are you guys like, I mean, you don't have to say specifically about Daz, but are there,
[13:44.430 --> 13:47.990]  are guys starting to trade? And like, you know, like we do with our photo periods more
[13:47.990 --> 13:52.310]  openly, you know, it kind of was like, seemed like everybody that started to get this thing
[13:52.310 --> 13:59.070]  figured out, it hunkered down, you know, and wasn't doing a whole lot of cross pollinating,
[13:59.070 --> 14:00.070]  if you will.
[14:00.190 --> 14:04.190]  Right. I mean, yeah, I'm seeing some of it, but not as much as I see in the photo period
[14:04.190 --> 14:09.030]  world. You know, like I had a few folks over last night, we did a barbecue. He's getting
[14:09.030 --> 14:13.230]  ready to move back to Missouri. And, you know, I brought out a bag that just the stuff that
[14:13.230 --> 14:17.550]  I got traded this year. I mean, a majority of it was photo and it's like the auto guys,
[14:17.550 --> 14:20.790]  we still kind of hunker down. Like if it's coming with auto and I'm not trying to be
[14:20.790 --> 14:25.390]  snarky or arrogant, but like it is to the point where it's like, okay, it's really on
[14:25.390 --> 14:29.710]  the cusp. And I'll share with close, you know, other close breeders that I've worked with
[14:29.710 --> 14:34.030]  in the past, kind of share the same ethics that you and I do. You build a trust, you
[14:34.030 --> 14:39.750]  build a rapport with each other and you share it out and do some crossing and work on it
[14:39.750 --> 14:45.510]  and work on it from remote. I do have another fellow breeder here in Washington. I work
[14:45.510 --> 14:51.230]  with him pretty close. He's done a cross with my anvil and he's called it the Mandalorian
[14:51.230 --> 14:57.190]  Fruit. And it's beautiful. It brought in his, he has regulars as well, brought in his Care
[14:57.190 --> 15:03.790]  Bears against my anvil and it's increased color and structure on both sides. So it's
[15:03.790 --> 15:09.190]  been nice to watch that come real time. A lot of the guys that I've worked with, as
[15:09.190 --> 15:13.310]  far as collaborations, I mean, you're one of the closest, he's one of the closest, but
[15:13.310 --> 15:17.230]  he's the first one to where we've actually worked it out. We have some stuff that we
[15:17.230 --> 15:21.030]  really like seeing and we're working on it together. So it was a new thing for me to
[15:21.030 --> 15:25.470]  take on something brand new that I've never worked before, just like with him. So it's
[15:25.470 --> 15:26.590]  been a nice collaboration.
[15:28.590 --> 15:34.750]  For those who aren't aware, can you walk through, before we kind of dig into the lines, can
[15:34.750 --> 15:39.470]  you walk through the process? So you have a stable auto flower line, for example, let's
[15:39.470 --> 15:43.990]  say your alf or your anvil and you want to mix in a photo period because you like that
[15:43.990 --> 15:48.590]  flavor or you like something about it. What's the, what's this timeline? What's the process
[15:48.590 --> 15:49.590]  and how does that look for you?
[15:50.470 --> 15:55.430]  So for me, like when I do it, if there is a photo that I really like, I will use, obviously
[15:55.430 --> 16:00.430]  the photo female and I like using the auto male. From my experience, the auto male carries
[16:00.430 --> 16:05.270]  in a lot of the traits that he's expressing. And I've seen that mainly with color and
[16:05.270 --> 16:10.430]  bud density. Structurally wise, obviously, if there's things that are speeding up the
[16:10.430 --> 16:15.910]  flowering process, if you see a male taking off real quick and it's going to help bring
[16:15.910 --> 16:19.470]  down the flower time of the female you're using, you know, those are the key items that
[16:19.470 --> 16:24.350]  you look for. And you take those off spring and then you start working down that line.
[16:24.350 --> 16:27.590]  There are certain traits each generation that I specifically look for. I'm not going
[16:27.590 --> 16:34.150]  to get into too much detail on what exactly I look for in the hybridization process. But
[16:34.150 --> 16:39.630]  what I will say is by F3, majority of your progeny are going to end up being auto flower.
[16:39.630 --> 16:43.630]  If you continue to breed the children, so you get, you take your photo female, you take
[16:43.630 --> 16:49.150]  your auto male, cross them, you get your offspring. You take that offspring, you select based
[16:49.150 --> 16:54.150]  upon either flower times or structure times in that generation. And then you go on and
[16:54.150 --> 16:59.150]  so forth as you move down. Usually by three, you know, F3, you'll see a higher ratio of
[16:59.150 --> 17:03.590]  your auto flower. F4, you're really going to start seeing some stability. F5 and F6
[17:03.590 --> 17:08.810]  and F7 is where you should start working on, you know, getting your pheno expressions together.
[17:08.810 --> 17:13.910]  That way when somebody does pop a thousand seeds, they're not seeing a thousand different
[17:13.910 --> 17:17.230]  phenotypes where some of them are pushing the top of somebody's 10 out and the other
[17:17.230 --> 17:20.750]  ones are only three inches, four inches tall. Those are the things you got to look for.
[17:20.750 --> 17:24.350]  So it's not as simple as just, you know, pollinating and going to town and getting it back and
[17:24.350 --> 17:28.270]  forth, but you also have to keep in mind what you're looking for, what your common end goal
[17:28.270 --> 17:31.590]  is. So I always say set a goal at the end of what you want this product. Okay. May it
[17:31.590 --> 17:36.230]  be the turps, may it be the size, but density and color, and then chase that out. It's easier
[17:36.230 --> 17:40.030]  to set a path, I think for a successful photo autocross, if you have in your mind already
[17:40.030 --> 17:44.430]  what you're looking for. And if you don't find it, you keep working until you do.
[17:44.430 --> 17:49.750]  So you do your first cross, you have your auto, auto male, and you have your, your red,
[17:49.750 --> 17:53.830]  your red female and you have her in a 12, 12, cause she's got a flower in a 12, 12.
[17:53.830 --> 17:58.950]  You bring your auto male and you dump her. Now your next round of selection, your F1,
[17:58.950 --> 18:05.790]  I guess. Are you, are you just leaving that in 18 hours and selecting only the ones that
[18:05.790 --> 18:10.530]  the auto flower, or do you, how do you, what's your next timing with the lights?
[18:10.530 --> 18:14.450]  So the next thing with timing with the lights is I will go either 18, six or 20 and four,
[18:14.450 --> 18:20.890]  like a veg cycle for the photo periods. And you know, auto is typically set anywhere between,
[18:20.890 --> 18:25.370]  I've seen as quick as 11 days and as long as two and a half, three weeks, depending
[18:25.370 --> 18:29.610]  on the end size of the plant. And so what I will do is I'll leave them on 18, six and
[18:29.610 --> 18:33.650]  watch for certain things to start, or 20 and four and watch for certain things to start
[18:33.650 --> 18:38.490]  showing up when the pre-flower starts showing up, you know, mark that down. What time did
[18:38.490 --> 18:43.930]  the pre-flower show up on plant 21, five and seven, because you noticed it first. And then
[18:43.930 --> 18:47.490]  I'll keep those lights on there until everything is sexed in there, because some people don't
[18:47.490 --> 18:51.850]  know that a photo period will sex itself without having to go to 12, 12. It just takes a little
[18:51.850 --> 18:56.570]  bit of time to do so. So once all the plants have sexed, and then I can find in that lot,
[18:56.570 --> 19:03.210]  who sexed the fastest and who may try to auto flower, I will take them to the next round.
[19:03.210 --> 19:05.450]  And I look for that on both the female side and the male side.
[19:05.450 --> 19:12.120]  I forgot my next question.
[19:12.120 --> 19:17.600]  Take your time.
[19:17.600 --> 19:19.680]  Could be that weed, man.
[19:19.680 --> 19:28.100]  Yeah, could be the weed. This ice cream cake. I don't know about you, but I'm on the bandwagon.
[19:28.100 --> 19:31.620]  Yeah, well, someone just asked earlier what you were smoking.
[19:31.620 --> 19:40.700]  Yeah, I've been on it for a few weeks and I just happened to, it's been in Washington for a while.
[19:40.860 --> 19:45.260]  I kind of wanted to grab a hold of it, but I didn't hear people rave about it until the
[19:45.260 --> 19:48.940]  spring when it was sitting in my hands in the clone form and everyone was talking about it.
[19:48.940 --> 19:53.900]  So I started looking around to get some flower to smoke and found someone that had some good
[19:53.900 --> 19:59.180]  flowers that I could smoke on. And so I started dumping pollen on it. And I actually just took
[19:59.180 --> 20:03.980]  down yesterday. I have like three different males on it. So I'm drying out right now.
[20:04.540 --> 20:08.300]  Organic pots, you're in the right place, because that's what we're going to be talking about
[20:08.300 --> 20:08.860]  imminently.
[20:09.420 --> 20:14.060]  That was my next question. My question is, and I know the answer, I'm just kind of prodding it,
[20:14.060 --> 20:20.460]  but one of your constants is pot size. And that's important when you're doing
[20:21.500 --> 20:24.780]  construction from here to auto and you're making an auto flower.
[20:27.500 --> 20:35.020]  Yeah, pot size to me is not so much pot size, but vertical drop and root pruning seem to have
[20:35.020 --> 20:43.340]  increased autos sizes over the last few years. I've seen just better root development. And I see
[20:43.340 --> 20:47.500]  if you give that initial tap root time to actually vertically drop well, because it wants to push
[20:47.500 --> 20:52.460]  down very quickly and very fast, like they germinate so quick. And then next thing you
[20:52.460 --> 20:57.100]  know, these things are taken off. And I think like pot size, I would recommend anything from
[20:57.100 --> 21:01.980]  a three gallon and above. If you're going 10 gallon, you can get away, especially if you're
[21:01.980 --> 21:05.580]  using an organic soil, you can get away in a 10 gallon, throw three seeds in there if you're
[21:05.580 --> 21:10.940]  running with regulars. So A, you can call the males if you choose to do so, and then let the
[21:10.940 --> 21:17.340]  other two females grow. They won't compete for their food resources, especially in an organic.
[21:17.340 --> 21:20.940]  I like to think about it, it's like vegetable garden, like I run hugelkultur beds here.
[21:23.020 --> 21:27.180]  And, you know, those vegetables run through that bed and they're side by side. I mean,
[21:27.180 --> 21:30.860]  obviously they're properly spaced, but like those roots and that root network is
[21:31.580 --> 21:36.060]  sprawling throughout there. And I see the same response with autos. It's more familial
[21:36.060 --> 21:41.340]  than competition. One of the farms, it's close to here that I first got introduced to,
[21:41.340 --> 21:44.460]  it's one of the things I told them, they had a bunch of 32 gallon pots. I was like, don't plant
[21:44.460 --> 21:48.940]  just one seed in that. Like it's going to be a waste of room. It's going to give you a better
[21:48.940 --> 21:53.500]  option to put seven or eight inside there because you'll be able to call the males,
[21:53.500 --> 21:57.020]  you'll still have some more space for the plants to actually grow. And, you know,
[21:57.020 --> 22:00.540]  your females will still get a decent size. And they took that and ran with it. It works out
[22:00.540 --> 22:05.180]  very, very well. And that's one thing I like to tell a lot of commercial growers is to approach,
[22:05.180 --> 22:09.340]  if they're in a pot system and not in the ground, is to approach it with multi, what I call multi
[22:09.340 --> 22:14.300]  potting large pots, 25 to 30 gallon with 10 seeds in it isn't really going to hurt anything.
[22:14.300 --> 22:15.740]  You're especially not going to hurt your yield.
[22:15.740 --> 22:24.410]  No, I wanted to cue up a...
[22:24.410 --> 22:26.090]  I guess next week...
[22:26.090 --> 22:30.570]  Well, just quick, quickly, Josh, do you know Smokey Point? When you mentioned
[22:30.570 --> 22:32.490]  Ice Cream Cake, because you're in Washington, right?
[22:34.010 --> 22:38.890]  Yeah, they're one of the larger producers. I'm not, you know, I don't know any of those
[22:38.890 --> 22:42.090]  guys at all. So I won't talk shit, but I generally don't like hydroponic weed.
[22:43.050 --> 22:43.610]  Got it.
[22:43.610 --> 22:48.570]  I'll say that. But I think they do, they have a really big facility that's really clean and
[22:48.570 --> 22:52.330]  nice. And whoever's running that thing, the people that are doing it, are doing a good job,
[22:52.330 --> 22:57.770]  you know, what they do. They have a big, big, beautiful, you know, like dosing room, you know,
[22:57.770 --> 23:00.570]  they have like 30 dosatrons, you know, where they have a lot of control.
[23:01.290 --> 23:02.250]  Oh, wow.
[23:03.130 --> 23:05.530]  There was a breeding question right there.
[23:06.250 --> 23:13.130]  I saw that. Are you using one mil per filial generation? Yes. Especially once you get into
[23:13.130 --> 23:18.890]  full auto. It's really hard. Like, if I were to save the male, that's why I say use the auto male
[23:18.890 --> 23:24.410]  and not the photo male into the female. The auto male is what's going to bring it in. I can't keep
[23:24.410 --> 23:29.930]  him. I can't keep him because once he's turned and burnt and he's spent, he's gone. And the reason I
[23:29.930 --> 23:35.370]  do that, I think with my stability comes in is finding that matching partner at each generation.
[23:36.170 --> 23:41.530]  And I think that really brings in the allele pairs, makes things happy. And you start seeing
[23:41.530 --> 23:45.450]  better balance in your family. That's something else I look for too, as far as stability goes,
[23:46.010 --> 23:49.690]  is the plant growing symmetrically or, you know, or is it growing asymmetrical? How's the plant
[23:49.690 --> 23:54.090]  look as far as balance? Are side branches coming out evenly? Are they coming, the fan fingers? Do
[23:54.090 --> 23:59.130]  we have seven on one side and seven on the other? Or is it five on one side and four on the other?
[23:59.130 --> 24:03.850]  You know, I look for that pairing to find the stability in the plant. So I do select the male
[24:03.850 --> 24:09.050]  each time, especially down the range of autos, the option I have. Now, the caveat I will say with
[24:09.130 --> 24:12.890]  that is I have seen people recently cloning autos and I actually had one of my cultivars
[24:12.890 --> 24:18.410]  cloned anvil from a lower side branch right before it got into heavy flower. And when I showed it to
[24:18.410 --> 24:22.490]  me, I thought he had seeded it. I thought it was a seeded plant because it got to the normal size.
[24:22.490 --> 24:27.450]  Anvil did and it responded the same, but he caught it early enough. Or I think that hormone change
[24:27.450 --> 24:31.210]  hadn't been too drastic in that section of the plant. If that's even a thing, because it blew
[24:31.210 --> 24:35.290]  me away. I still don't understand why it worked the way it did. And then of course, I was like,
[24:35.290 --> 24:38.970]  I want to see pictures of the process, not just the start and the finish, because
[24:38.970 --> 24:42.410]  it could have been seeded. And of course, fortunately the gentleman recorded everything.
[24:42.410 --> 24:49.770]  So it was interesting to see that actually like work. So you can clone autos, but I typically do
[24:49.770 --> 24:53.770]  not. And I don't keep males for, you know, succession generation.
[24:56.330 --> 25:01.690]  Um, someone was asking about the ABC and we're going to get there. Um, but I want to like,
[25:01.690 --> 25:05.610]  let you talk about the Anvil and the Alf because you kind of need to explain those
[25:05.610 --> 25:07.770]  before you go to what we have available today.
[25:09.050 --> 25:14.010]  And I, and I actually just, there's just a last, uh, kind of general question about autos.
[25:14.010 --> 25:17.770]  That's Robert Mayer, my homeboy. We learned to grow together in Portland.
[25:19.370 --> 25:20.170]  Shout out Robbie.
[25:25.470 --> 25:26.510]  Do you see that one, Dan?
[25:27.390 --> 25:30.750]  What's the average height? Yeah, I see it now. The average height in this time,
[25:30.750 --> 25:37.470]  we were talking about that a little bit earlier. Um, the average height, and that comes back to
[25:37.470 --> 25:41.310]  what I've seen in pot depth. I've seen fields that all come out six foot tall because they're
[25:41.310 --> 25:45.390]  in the ground. They have vertical root job. They have no restriction as long as it's a
[25:45.390 --> 25:50.830]  well-built field and they get huge. Um, I would say your best bet, if you're a home grower,
[25:50.830 --> 25:54.350]  if you're inside a tent and you're going into three to a five gallon pot, if you're going to
[25:54.350 --> 25:58.030]  run something that comes from my lines, like we're talking about the Alf or the Anvil, you're looking
[25:58.030 --> 26:04.590]  at three to four foot tall. Um, my cousins had a couple of freaks that got six foot tall in three
[26:04.590 --> 26:09.470]  gallon pots. Um, but you know, I'd say the average you're going to see anywhere between three to
[26:09.470 --> 26:13.230]  four foot. Sometimes the larger ones, which I will mark as larger because I'm seeing a higher
[26:13.230 --> 26:24.010]  consistent number as larger, um, are six or usually six foot on average. And the veg time.
[26:24.010 --> 26:26.730]  So tell us about the Alf or the Anvil, whichever.
[26:27.930 --> 26:28.570]  The what now?
[26:28.730 --> 26:31.610]  I said, tell us about the Anvil. That was the first one you made, right?
[26:32.810 --> 26:38.090]  So Anvil was the one I put the hardest work into initially, um, that in the gym. Uh, gym was
[26:38.090 --> 26:41.770]  actually one of my first, and I didn't realize her potential until I got it out here and was
[26:41.770 --> 26:46.410]  able to actually probably have it tested. And I'll touch on that in a second. But the Anvil
[26:46.410 --> 26:50.970]  was the one that really took off for me. Um, I got stability in color. I got stability in
[26:50.970 --> 26:55.930]  TTC percentages. I got stability in height and yields to the point where we were calculating
[26:56.570 --> 27:03.130]  yield per square foot rather than per plant, because it was coming out so regularly balanced.
[27:03.130 --> 27:07.610]  Height was the same. The colors were the same. Even the males were showing the purple color.
[27:07.610 --> 27:16.970]  And that would, I think really, really launched me into credibility. Um, and then the Alf is
[27:16.970 --> 27:24.490]  basically the stable in a horse, like the foundation of a lot of my work. Um, and then
[27:24.490 --> 27:29.050]  the Anvil is basically the foundation of a lot of my work because it's, it's so stable. Uh,
[27:29.050 --> 27:36.250]  she's a higher yielder. Uh, they get pretty decently large. They have a great resin coverage.
[27:36.250 --> 27:40.970]  They're just, it's a well around, well-rounded, easy to plant, to grow for people. Anvil can be
[27:40.970 --> 27:48.170]  a little bit fakey because she's, I think it's the color. And I'm not sure if she just has high
[27:48.170 --> 27:51.690]  food demand and people don't expect that with autos to be completely honest with you. People
[27:51.690 --> 27:56.810]  want to grow it because it's beautiful, but the demand that she pulls right before flower,
[27:56.810 --> 28:01.210]  a lot of people don't expect. And a lot of people that grow it said they can water a three gallon
[28:01.210 --> 28:05.690]  pot every other day because during the early stage of flower, it's really starting to pick up
[28:05.690 --> 28:13.130]  and start to pull from that pot. Um, Gem on the other hand is a huge, was a huge surprise. It
[28:13.130 --> 28:21.130]  came in at harvest to 3% CBG as well as 13% THC, which I know is a low percentage on THC,
[28:21.210 --> 28:25.370]  but the CBG with the medical capability of that, I mean, it really helped me with
[28:26.410 --> 28:32.730]  anti-inflammatory. It helped with, um, migraines. It helped with oral pain. It helped with joint
[28:32.730 --> 28:38.490]  pain and, you know, circulation. And I thought it was just a high content of CBD potentially.
[28:38.490 --> 28:41.850]  And then we had a lab tested and I couldn't believe in one of the farms in Maine,
[28:41.850 --> 28:48.410]  a light for health did a FICO extract on it and they got 10% CBG in a gram. So that was exciting
[28:48.410 --> 28:53.850]  to see. So that's a huge benefit and it's a 60 day cultivar too. So it germinates, finishes,
[28:53.850 --> 28:58.250]  and ready to harvest in 60 days. So if you're really looking for some kind of pain management
[28:58.250 --> 29:02.410]  or medication, that'd be a huge one to look into. If you're looking in for color and you're looking
[29:02.410 --> 29:06.330]  for THC percentages, anvils one to check out. And then if you're looking for something that
[29:06.330 --> 29:10.810]  you want to breed against and you want to use as like a staple in your photo to autocross,
[29:10.810 --> 29:14.570]  I would check out. It's just going to bring forward a majority of the work that I've done
[29:14.570 --> 29:18.890]  for the last 10 years because it's bait. Like I said, that's my stud in the stable.
[29:21.050 --> 29:22.730]  And then do you see that question?
[29:23.610 --> 29:29.770]  I do. I do support topping in LST for autos. I definitely don't see a problem with it. I don't
[29:29.770 --> 29:33.450]  generally do it myself because I'm looking for the mechanics of the plant and to see the full
[29:33.450 --> 29:41.210]  expression of the phenotype. But I would suggest doing it more so with if you have feminized autos
[29:41.210 --> 29:46.650]  because if you've got a regular auto, I say the best time to top is once they get up to that true
[29:46.650 --> 29:51.850]  second to third node so you can expand your branching. And if you're you do that and then
[29:51.850 --> 29:56.250]  you wait out with a regular next thing you know, you've got this beautiful shaped and LST top male
[29:57.530 --> 30:01.610]  and you like you have to pull it out. So you've overworked on topping it. You've overworked on
[30:01.610 --> 30:05.210]  training it and now you have to remove it. So if you're going to do it, I would recommend having
[30:05.210 --> 30:08.730]  fems do so unless you just want to take the risk. You know, I mean, it's up to you.
[30:09.290 --> 30:19.340]  So what do we want to I'm looking at any last kind of general questions, but go for it.
[30:20.620 --> 30:23.020]  I was just going to say we're already we're already kind of starting in
[30:26.140 --> 30:33.900]  about this available up on the site. Dog love. Peter probably pop that up on the bottom down
[30:33.900 --> 30:41.340]  there. There he goes. So we have what? Okay, so you want to start with Jim? Yeah, let's just
[30:41.740 --> 30:44.940]  yeah, let's just I mean, he's already talking about it. Let's just kind of yeah. All right,
[30:44.940 --> 30:48.780]  I've been let's keep going. I'll cue up some pictures while you're talking. Give me a second.
[30:50.700 --> 30:52.060]  Start waxing poetic.
[30:55.660 --> 31:02.060]  So talk about Jim a little bit. Like I was saying, 60 days. It's an it's more along the lines of an
[31:02.060 --> 31:06.620]  original auto flower. So you may see some stunt points in it. If you stress it out too hard,
[31:06.620 --> 31:10.300]  I wouldn't suggest topping it or transplanting it and starting it in the final pot.
[31:11.340 --> 31:14.060]  By the time it's done, you're looking at, like I said,
[31:15.660 --> 31:21.020]  3% CVG or higher, and some, you know, 13 to 15% THC
[31:23.340 --> 31:29.260]  percentages with it. It doesn't like to be fed heavily. It'll do really, really well in an
[31:29.260 --> 31:35.660]  organic soil. And it's pretty, pretty forgiving as far as like once you get her up and going,
[31:35.660 --> 31:40.540]  but those that first week or so I would say, you know, treat it with a little bit of care and
[31:41.580 --> 31:50.700]  it'll reward you well in the end. She was my first experience with IBL and it's an F9. I believe now
[31:50.700 --> 31:56.060]  I got to look at my packaging. It's all the way up to F9. So it's pretty stable as far as your
[31:56.060 --> 32:00.060]  phenotypical expressions. And I feel that your CVG expression is going to be about the same.
[32:06.540 --> 32:10.940]  And that's a multi-pot right there. That picture right there is actual a multi-pot.
[32:10.940 --> 32:21.020]  That is a, I want to say a two or a three gallon square pot, plastic pot that had, I want to say
[32:21.020 --> 32:25.740]  four to five plants to start. And that's finished three females, I believe. It's been a while since
[32:25.740 --> 32:30.060]  that one, but that's an actual multi-pot that I was talking about earlier. That's not just one plant.
[32:33.120 --> 32:37.840]  And then here's the, you want to actually talk about this, the COA and kind of what
[32:37.840 --> 32:44.080]  stands out for you. Yeah. So that's COA right there. At first I was kind of disappointed because
[32:44.080 --> 32:47.840]  of the low THC. And that was before I really understood what was going on. And then I started
[32:47.840 --> 32:51.360]  looking at that CVG and I was like, why is that percentage higher than any other COA I've ever
[32:51.360 --> 32:56.960]  seen? What does that mean? And I started digging up on what CVG was. And that's what I found kind
[32:56.960 --> 33:00.800]  of like, not the holy grail, but it was like, oh my goodness, this is something different and rare
[33:01.840 --> 33:05.840]  that we're not, we haven't really seen. Now I know there's some out there now that have way
[33:05.840 --> 33:10.480]  higher percentages and that pretty much pure CVG, but at the time it was one of the first ones I saw
[33:10.480 --> 33:18.160]  with those kinds of numbers. And actually we have a, we have a CVG question. Does CVG make the buzz
[33:18.160 --> 33:25.280]  creep up, like easing into the high instead of instantly being way too high? I think you see
[33:25.280 --> 33:29.760]  more of a synergy and a balance. It's going to not creep, but it's not going to send you fine over
[33:29.760 --> 33:34.960]  the edge type of deal. One of the things I have done is if I smoke something that's super high THC,
[33:34.960 --> 33:39.840]  it really starts to send me out. I will smoke some of the gem or some CVG to kind of tone things
[33:39.840 --> 33:46.320]  back down a little bit. That works well for me. So that's one thing. It's like a saving grace
[33:46.320 --> 33:50.400]  almost because I've eaten some edibles at times that, you know, we've all, I think maybe have
[33:50.400 --> 33:55.120]  been there to think that you're not going to come back. And that kind of helped bring it in a little
[33:55.120 --> 34:04.160]  bit. So we have a fox tailing question. So the fox tailing I haven't seen in gem, it likes to form
[34:04.160 --> 34:09.040]  nice solid buds. Otters do tend to like to fox tail. And I think that's from the original
[34:09.040 --> 34:14.080]  ruderalis. I've seen some landrace stuff from Siberia being grown and a few other locations,
[34:14.080 --> 34:20.000]  and you can see where those traits are coming from. It's absolutely 100%, I would say from the
[34:20.000 --> 34:24.880]  ruderalis. Now I have seen some that gets able and light stress or heat stress caused the fox tailing.
[34:26.800 --> 34:31.440]  But gem doesn't fox tail heavily at all. Anvil will if she gets heat stressed.
[34:32.320 --> 34:36.080]  Towards the end of flower, if it's too warm in a greenhouse, I've seen it. If somebody's
[34:36.080 --> 34:41.360]  tents temperatures are breaking into the 90s, they'll get some nice dense buds. But at the
[34:41.360 --> 34:43.920]  top and the outsides of that bud, they'll start fox tailing out on you.
[34:46.160 --> 34:49.840]  So we have a light. Go ahead, Josh.
[34:51.040 --> 34:56.080]  Well, I was going to say my CBG, there's a lot of folks continuing to ask, and I didn't realize
[34:56.080 --> 35:01.280]  that everyone wasn't really hip on it. But my CBG intro was that night that I met you, Dan,
[35:01.840 --> 35:07.840]  at Shango's thing. And after, the closer I got to having to speak, I was so nervous. I get so
[35:07.840 --> 35:13.680]  nervous in front of people. I lose my voice, and I get to fall on butterflies, and I was sweating
[35:13.680 --> 35:20.480]  hard. I was really fucking nervous, and irrationally. And Shango walks up to me, he goes,
[35:20.480 --> 35:26.400]  here, I got this gift for you. It's a vial of CBG RSO. And I was like, oh, tell me about it.
[35:26.400 --> 35:33.280]  And he's like, this will soothe your anxiety, and it'll make you feel like you have a cape on.
[35:33.840 --> 35:37.280]  And he's like, you almost have to be too careful with it. He's like, you can really
[35:37.840 --> 35:44.480]  get too brash and bold. I was like, oh, crazy. And he gave me this weight of responsibility
[35:44.480 --> 35:49.360]  when he handed me this thing, type of thing. And then I was telling him how I was freaking out,
[35:49.360 --> 35:52.480]  and he's like, well, let me just give you a cap right now. And he gave me a little pill,
[35:53.040 --> 35:59.040]  and I ate it maybe 20 minutes before. And it was exactly like he said. It felt like,
[35:59.040 --> 36:02.800]  right as I walked on the stage, I was like, how am I going to do this? I'm losing my mind,
[36:02.800 --> 36:07.840]  sweating balls. And I walked up, and he introduced me. I hugged Shango, and it felt like in that
[36:07.840 --> 36:14.720]  moment, just like, aw. And I was like, hello, I'm cool. I'm Mr. Chill. And it just totally
[36:14.720 --> 36:21.440]  calmed me down, and I was able to do the talk really in a good space. And I was like, holy shit.
[36:21.440 --> 36:29.120]  So since then, me and my wife have been actually buying a CBG-infused pen just to have a reference
[36:29.120 --> 36:35.680]  for if we need to calm down a little bit. I also did a seed trade with Dreamin Farms out in
[36:35.680 --> 36:41.520]  Minnesota. He's a hemp farmer, and he grows some high-CBG stuff. And I trade him for a pound of
[36:41.520 --> 36:49.280]  CBG so I can just have that shit on deck. It's really cool shit to have as a medicine. So that's
[36:49.280 --> 37:00.560]  my rant. And then any special lower lighting requirements for autos or same as regular?
[37:01.520 --> 37:05.040]  Same as regular. I mean, I started off just like anybody else growing them underneath
[37:05.680 --> 37:12.480]  high-intensity discharge lighting, may it be ceramic metal halide or HPS. I mean, either way,
[37:14.800 --> 37:19.520]  I would say I would recommend, honestly, a higher-powered light. If you've got the ability
[37:19.520 --> 37:24.160]  to run 600 to 1,000-watt HPS or you have the ability to run your higher-wattage panels, LED,
[37:24.160 --> 37:32.400]  go for it. They don't seem to balk at the extra light being handled to them. Forever Green indoors
[37:32.480 --> 37:35.600]  is one of the company's lighting brands that I use personally and actually got a really good
[37:35.600 --> 37:41.680]  relationship with those guys. Sorry, can you say the name again? Yeah, it's Forever Green indoors.
[37:42.480 --> 37:48.800]  Forever Green indoors. Yeah, they're based out of Washington, actually, which is really super cool.
[37:51.840 --> 37:55.440]  I might get loud here for a second. It seems my wife and kid are returning. So if you hear a
[37:55.440 --> 38:03.600]  screaming toddler, I apologize, guys. But the lighting that's coming from them, a couple of
[38:03.600 --> 38:08.240]  things that we have done, I've been growing, I've gotten one, two, three, four. I'm on my fifth
[38:08.240 --> 38:12.480]  light from them, either by testing or just personal choice or them sending me stuff to look
[38:12.480 --> 38:18.960]  over and see how it works with the autos. And we've noticed with their lighting, and it's the
[38:19.680 --> 38:25.840]  more of the white light with far reds than it is your traditional blue-purple LEDs that we all got
[38:25.840 --> 38:30.400]  used to from the beginning of the LED days. And we were looking at the fact that we could park
[38:30.960 --> 38:37.360]  their LEDs within six inches of the canopy and not get any kind of light burn. We weren't seeing
[38:37.360 --> 38:41.040]  bleach fuzz. We weren't seeing degradation in the trichrome coverage. We weren't seeing
[38:41.040 --> 38:44.960]  scorched leaves, all the typical signs you would see if your light's way too close.
[38:45.840 --> 38:50.240]  And the autos seemed to take it very well. And he did an actual in-lab test with their
[38:50.960 --> 38:55.280]  square three light, which is one of the ones that I run. And he was running a par meter the entire
[38:55.280 --> 39:03.760]  time. And it was incredible to see how close he could park that light to those plants without it
[39:03.760 --> 39:07.120]  scorching and burning them. They just took it and continued to fly around like they normally would.
[39:12.710 --> 39:15.030]  Sorry, the wife doesn't want to be on camera, guys. I apologize.
[39:15.990 --> 39:21.270]  So here's just a general getting your stuff tested question.
[39:23.030 --> 39:25.030]  Sorry, I'm totally blanking. You're in what state?
[39:25.750 --> 39:26.790]  I'm in Washington as well.
[39:27.350 --> 39:32.150]  Right. Okay. So for you, what does it cost to test a sample?
[39:33.990 --> 39:37.510]  It's pretty much the same as the commercial growers. I have to go in, show my paperwork.
[39:38.390 --> 39:43.750]  And then you go through. I want to say they go out for two prices. A simple basic test for me,
[39:44.550 --> 39:47.910]  if I remember correctly, I haven't tested yet this year. I'm getting ready to go in and test.
[39:47.910 --> 39:53.190]  But last year, I think we're just a simple potency test. Cash was like 56 bucks. If you're going to
[39:53.190 --> 40:01.910]  pay after the test done, it's closer to like 80. So upfront was always the key. So it can fluctuate
[40:01.910 --> 40:06.630]  a little bit. And then once you start getting into like terpenes and full panels, you could look up
[40:06.630 --> 40:12.070]  to up into 100 bucks a test maybe depending on, yeah, or higher. Yeah, I know.
[40:12.790 --> 40:20.950]  Yeah, it's basically a 50 bucks a line item is the going price in Washington, 50, 60 bucks. So
[40:20.950 --> 40:33.270]  50 bucks for potency, 50 bucks for terpenes, 50 bucks for micros, and 50 bucks for hematocytes,
[40:33.270 --> 40:39.110]  another 50 bucks. So you can spend 300, 400 bucks on a test. It's being widely debated right now in
[40:39.110 --> 40:45.030]  Washington because legally I'm required to test every five pounds. So that's an additional two,
[40:45.030 --> 40:50.790]  300 bucks per five pounds. It's wild. Yeah. Well, and a five pound lot too. It's funny that they
[40:50.790 --> 40:56.710]  make it every five pounds. It's some weird balls we got to deal with. But it makes sense if you're
[40:56.710 --> 41:00.390]  just doing like if we're a breeding thing and you're trying to learn a thing and then that
[41:00.390 --> 41:05.910]  applies for future information. Exactly. I mean, it makes huge sense there because that's what
[41:06.230 --> 41:10.950]  brings it back to one of the questions they were talking about earlier. Like one of the tools I have
[41:10.950 --> 41:16.470]  in my arsenal is that testing to move forward or to stop a selection and stuff like that. It's
[41:16.470 --> 41:21.510]  really nice to have the ability to have an insight of which direction you're going. Whereas before it
[41:21.510 --> 41:27.670]  was all here, visual and smell and then effect. That was the only three trifecta I had. Now I
[41:27.670 --> 41:35.110]  have that three on top of lab testing, which shows me where we're going, where we're headed.
[41:36.790 --> 41:43.350]  And then how many hours are you running your lights during veg for the auto?
[41:44.150 --> 41:48.390]  So for autos, I never switch my light schedules. The only time I switch my light schedules is due
[41:48.390 --> 41:53.430]  to season. So summertime, if I'm running them indoor, it's 18-6. And then through the wintertime,
[41:53.430 --> 41:59.510]  when it's a little bit cooler, I'll run 20 on and four off. I typically don't like to run 24 hours
[41:59.510 --> 42:04.310]  because I feel that the plant is missing the Calvin cycle. And yes, autoflowers will flower,
[42:04.310 --> 42:09.430]  a true autoflower will flower under 24 hours of light with no problem whatsoever. But that Calvin
[42:09.430 --> 42:13.670]  cycle part of the photosynthesis process, I think is important for the carbon bonding and creating
[42:13.670 --> 42:18.790]  the glucose in the plant. So I think your auto should have a rest period. We all sleep, why
[42:18.790 --> 42:27.590]  shouldn't they? I've been corrected. Well, but I mean, they're short, but I mean, what?
[42:28.630 --> 42:31.750]  Everybody has got their opinion on that. I've talked to Lowenfelds about this too.
[42:31.910 --> 42:36.550]  Lowenfelds is like, well, the Calvin cycle can still happen under 24 hours of lighting. Okay,
[42:36.550 --> 42:40.950]  so I've got some more to learn to figure out as well. But it's one of those things where I've
[42:40.950 --> 42:44.630]  never been a guy to run 24-7 with them, mainly because of my power bill.
[42:46.950 --> 42:55.270]  Got it. All right. So we've kind of covered the gem, right?
[42:56.790 --> 43:00.310]  Yeah. I mean, if there's any other questions about it, I'd be more than happy to field them.
[43:00.310 --> 43:05.350]  I think it's pretty much covered. It's one of my first, that was my breeding experience.
[43:05.350 --> 43:08.710]  You know, I mean, that's what taught me how to understand the mechanics of the autoflower. It's
[43:08.710 --> 43:12.630]  what taught me their behavior and how to prove the autoflower. And then that's when I started
[43:12.630 --> 43:19.270]  venturing out into the outlines. And then from the outlines to anvil, you know, there's the
[43:19.270 --> 43:28.470]  Bobby's Widow and stuff, which we'll talk about all that. Okay. All right. All right. So moving on,
[43:28.470 --> 43:33.830]  do you want to do Bobby's Widow? I guess you just mentioned that. So you want to go there?
[43:34.390 --> 43:38.150]  Yeah, let's go there. Let's talk about Bobby's. And that's an F3?
[43:39.030 --> 43:46.070]  That is an F3. Okay. So the Bobby's Widow is now an F3. There's been several generations in between
[43:46.070 --> 43:50.230]  where it could have been further down the line. But I stopped because I wasn't liking what I see.
[43:50.230 --> 43:54.310]  And I started getting reboot. You know, there's only a certain percentage of seats that are going
[43:54.310 --> 43:57.910]  to show up each time that you're really going to be happy with, especially when it comes to autos,
[43:57.910 --> 44:02.230]  not like we were talking about earlier, you can go back to a parent that you've kept. So you got
[44:02.230 --> 44:08.470]  to search through those lines to find that parent. Bobby's has actually got a touch of
[44:09.270 --> 44:16.470]  alpha number four in her. And it's got a, obviously it's got White Widow in it. She is
[44:17.510 --> 44:23.990]  the fastest I've seen guys grow in this, taking it down at 55 or 56 days. The average time is 60.
[44:23.990 --> 44:30.470]  I put that 60 out there because I'm not going to try to boast a 50 day period on a plant. I've
[44:30.470 --> 44:35.910]  seen it often enough. So have other growers, but you're looking at 60 days to grab a hold of
[44:35.910 --> 44:41.030]  something and what you're looking at right there. She's really, really good for hash.
[44:41.670 --> 44:48.150]  It presses extremely well. I've seen anywhere between 20 and 22% returns on her. The flowers
[44:48.150 --> 44:56.070]  are super dense, little golf balls and highly resonance coded. The smoke is uplifting. I call
[44:56.070 --> 45:01.670]  it a hybrid 50-50. I think you'll see more of the energy from it, but it's also got a nice body stone
[45:01.670 --> 45:06.230]  to where it kind of just relaxes you at the same time. So it doesn't send you completely smiling
[45:06.230 --> 45:14.150]  out. It's got a really, really good balance. Those were actually grown, I think at the end of
[45:15.030 --> 45:19.270]  summer last year is when I finished those out. That was just after a seed run.
[45:19.270 --> 45:21.670]  That's what the progny looked like. And that's when I chose to release.
[45:24.630 --> 45:29.270]  And I wear just to give people an idea that that picture right there, I wear a large size
[45:29.830 --> 45:35.030]  glove and those are the top crown buds coming off of it. It's not the prettiest trim job because I
[45:35.030 --> 45:38.790]  like to leave a little sugar leaf, but it gives you an idea of the density that's coming off.
[45:39.750 --> 45:45.990]  There's no give to those buds whatsoever. They're super dense. Yeah. And this is the one you won
[45:45.990 --> 45:50.550]  though, the competition, or one of someone that grew. What was the story with the...
[45:51.670 --> 45:56.630]  So that's where I was going to go next, actually. I actually went, there was a
[45:56.630 --> 46:00.470]  auto flower cup held last year in Grants Pass, Oregon. It was the first one of its kind.
[46:01.190 --> 46:10.310]  And it was by the people, with the people. And I was up against names like Mephisto and FastBuds
[46:10.310 --> 46:16.230]  and Night Owl and a few other different brands that are well-known in the auto community. And
[46:16.230 --> 46:22.630]  to have a cultivar that I designed and grew and shaped in my basements and garages come out and
[46:23.830 --> 46:29.430]  chose a second place amongst those people was huge. I didn't win number one, which is fine,
[46:30.150 --> 46:36.390]  but just to be able to have the people say, I liked it enough that I ended up with an award for
[46:36.390 --> 46:41.030]  it. So it was super humbling. I still quite don't know how to take that, but it was great.
[46:41.910 --> 46:46.550]  It was a huge experience, not just for the cup winning, but the whole weekend. It was my first
[46:46.550 --> 46:51.030]  event to where you've got a campground that's completely cannabis friendly. Everybody,
[46:51.030 --> 46:55.190]  there was copious amounts of cannabis there. I think it was the most I've ever smoked in one
[46:55.190 --> 46:58.630]  weekend, except maybe with you, Josh. I think you've got a close second to that.
[47:02.550 --> 47:06.710]  You know, it happens. But yeah, fortunately I won that award and it
[47:07.910 --> 47:12.870]  kind of put some steam behind me and let me know that this wasn't just a pipe dream anymore.
[47:14.390 --> 47:20.550]  Well, it's good, man. I mean, we all have that. We've all been growing our closet and then to
[47:20.550 --> 47:25.270]  have someone else smoke your weed that you respect, even better, a whole community of people,
[47:26.550 --> 47:31.350]  that says something and it feels good and it validates the hard work you've been doing, man.
[47:31.910 --> 47:36.470]  Right. I mean, it was. I mean, it was a validation point and it was a huge honor,
[47:36.470 --> 47:37.350]  you know, to say the least.
[47:42.380 --> 47:45.580]  There was a question about, hold on. I was looking for,
[47:46.380 --> 47:49.180]  someone was asking about muricine or one of the...
[47:49.420 --> 47:54.700]  Do you have test results for Bobbies to throw up? I can't remember.
[47:54.700 --> 47:58.700]  No, I don't have them yet. I'm getting ready to get some tested.
[47:58.700 --> 48:03.900]  It's part of what I got to get done. I haven't got COAs on it, but that's coming next.
[48:05.020 --> 48:08.460]  What was the flavor on it? I haven't grown it or smoked it, did you say?
[48:09.660 --> 48:15.420]  So the aroma that comes off the plant is very an acetone, hands down acetone. You're going to get,
[48:15.420 --> 48:19.740]  like, as they were growing, I would go in there and of course, you know, I'm checking out the
[48:19.740 --> 48:23.420]  turf profiles and checking out the smells. And I mean, it reminded me opening up a bottle of
[48:23.420 --> 48:27.100]  nail polish remover when I don't have any alcohol to clean, like, Sharpie marker off of something.
[48:29.100 --> 48:34.300]  I'm like, pure, pure acetone. And then as they cure out, you'll start to smell some
[48:34.300 --> 48:38.380]  sweet berries and behind it, I can't put my finger on the berry, but acetone is definitely there.
[48:39.580 --> 48:45.100]  A Light for Health Farms, again, in Maine, who ran a huge bed of them, he said the acetone
[48:45.420 --> 48:47.900]  was there. I see exactly what you were talking about.
[48:49.500 --> 48:57.260]  So we got Lewis Taylor's asking, where can I get the Bobby's Widow? The site scrolling on the
[48:57.260 --> 49:05.340]  bottom, daga.love is the deal. So we got them all up there. Yeah. So I initially was going to hold
[49:05.340 --> 49:11.100]  back on this and not release it until next year. Then after having a farm run 1,500 of them and
[49:11.740 --> 49:17.900]  the feedback I'm getting from the people, I decided to do another, you know, slim release
[49:17.900 --> 49:23.180]  of them until I get them up to F4. I got a lot of good feedback. People really wanted it. And I
[49:23.180 --> 49:27.900]  don't want it just to be super exclusive, but I think it's something that's like, I'll trickle in
[49:27.900 --> 49:33.020]  the stream as we go along until I get something new else, you know, something else new.
[49:33.020 --> 49:40.540]  Yeah. Yeah. And we were just, you know, Dan talked about this yesterday and
[49:41.500 --> 49:46.300]  we got a limited batch available today. And then we'll have some more on the Regen Seedco site.
[49:46.300 --> 49:51.420]  And then him and I are going to do a collab essentially where he's going to use my facility
[49:51.420 --> 49:56.540]  and I'm going to do the grunt work to do a feminized line of the Bobby's Widow,
[49:57.740 --> 50:02.620]  which we're going to do a large fucking, a large run of it. And we'll have a ton of seeds.
[50:02.620 --> 50:08.700]  We're shooting for half a million. I think we can probably get a million. So that's going to
[50:08.700 --> 50:15.340]  be really exciting to be able to do that together and learn from you and make that available. I'm
[50:15.340 --> 50:19.500]  stoked, dude. Well, I'm stoked about that too. I think that collab's going to be good for both,
[50:19.500 --> 50:22.060]  you know, the homegrown market, because there's a gap that I'm missing because,
[50:24.220 --> 50:27.340]  and I'm looking at it from an education standpoint, which one of the reasons why
[50:27.340 --> 50:31.340]  I released regulars is so people can learn how to sex plant and understand that cannabis isn't all
[50:31.340 --> 50:35.260]  female. There's a huge misconception right now with homegrowers in new legal states. They're
[50:35.260 --> 50:39.260]  like, well, what do you mean a male? And they see a male and they're like, oh, I'm a plant hermed.
[50:39.260 --> 50:47.340]  No, what you have is a genetic male there. And I think it's important to get the feminized out
[50:47.340 --> 50:52.460]  there to eliminate the potential guesswork for our new homegrower or somebody who's wanting to
[50:52.460 --> 50:56.940]  get into autos and, you know, they've either sex plants or they haven't, and they just don't have
[50:56.940 --> 51:00.300]  to worry about it. So they can play a little bit more. They can top, like we were talking earlier,
[51:00.300 --> 51:03.500]  with more confidence, knowing that that top isn't going to be a waste of their time.
[51:03.500 --> 51:06.380]  And then the other thing that's just going to be a huge for commercial market, you know,
[51:06.380 --> 51:13.340]  Bobby's is fast. It's quick. It will help them increase, you know, their stock while they're
[51:13.340 --> 51:17.900]  waiting for their next big run to finish up. I mean, 60 days is pretty darn quick, you know,
[51:17.900 --> 51:22.300]  without cloning, without, you know, the seven week clone period, waiting for it to go. And then after
[51:22.300 --> 51:27.180]  the clone takes off inside the pot and you get up out and then you guys, you know, flip your lights.
[51:27.180 --> 51:31.260]  So it'd be really nice to have that introduction, like three different levels.
[51:34.490 --> 51:35.610]  Do you see that question?
[51:36.410 --> 51:41.050]  Sure do. So right now I've got, give me a second here. Oh, yeah.
[51:42.570 --> 51:47.850]  Look, you're a coal miners daughter. There's like five or six that I've stabilized that I would
[51:47.850 --> 51:52.890]  consider ready to release. I've got freebies floating around out there. They're, you know,
[51:52.890 --> 51:57.210]  results of probably a work in progress. One of them particularly is the forge, which is an
[51:57.210 --> 52:04.170]  anvil cross a Durban poison. And it's amazing how Durban really carried through in the line.
[52:04.170 --> 52:07.930]  I was fortunate enough. I, you know, cloned that out actually, Josh, at the
[52:07.930 --> 52:12.730]  meeting where I met you, I brought a bunch of clones to dial into for patients. And
[52:14.650 --> 52:20.330]  I actually got to visit one. Somebody has kept it alive now for close to two seasons. And I got to
[52:20.330 --> 52:25.210]  test the flowers and it smells exactly what the finished flower of the porch smells like. So
[52:25.210 --> 52:30.730]  I was shocked just at the simplest, you know, initially it was Ruder Rallis cross Durban that
[52:30.730 --> 52:38.570]  was taken to F2. And then that F2 female was introduced by an F5 male of anvil.
[52:39.210 --> 52:43.930]  And then it's now two generations beyond that cross. And it still tastes like Durban.
[52:46.170 --> 52:52.970]  So just quickly, we have two, when I was looking for one person was looking for kind of something
[52:52.970 --> 52:56.890]  that helps, I guess, helps with sleep. And then someone else was,
[53:00.170 --> 53:07.370]  doesn't want sleep. So low in myrcene. So, our gem for sleep,
[53:08.570 --> 53:13.690]  Alf carries a lot of myrcene. I got a ton of it. I have tests on that. I have to pull up
[53:14.250 --> 53:18.650]  the sheets on it. I don't know if I sent that to you or not. Josh, I think I may have,
[53:19.210 --> 53:25.770]  but it's really heavy in that. And then if you're looking to stay uplifted, you know, if you grab
[53:28.250 --> 53:32.490]  with this, I'll send out some freebies. I'll send out some free stuff. It's got the Durban in it.
[53:33.210 --> 53:39.530]  It's a little spacey for me. I like to run around on it. And the Bobby's widow, you're going to get
[53:39.530 --> 53:44.010]  an uptick too, especially if you pull it just a little bit early, you'll get more of an uptick
[53:44.010 --> 53:51.210]  and like productivity and it's more energetic. Got it. Okay. That was helpful.
[53:53.930 --> 54:04.050]  Sorry. I'm looking through the chat. I know weather took a weird turn here. It's like 10
[54:04.050 --> 54:08.850]  degrees cooler than what it was yesterday. Super strange. Yeah. I woke up in it with the ground
[54:08.850 --> 54:14.610]  was frozen solid. I wasn't ready for it. Yeah. A couple clones outside. I'm like, Oh, I wasn't
[54:14.610 --> 54:25.250]  not going to like me. Yeah, no. So just one last run through. This is the Bobby's widow, right?
[54:25.890 --> 54:30.850]  That is correct. That's the Bobby's widow at three, um, 60 turnaround or less.
[54:34.650 --> 54:38.250]  And I would call it an uplift hybrid. That's probably one of my favorite pictures right there.
[54:38.250 --> 54:42.090]  I just was amazing to watch the turnout on that.
[54:42.730 --> 54:45.290]  And that was actually grown under this forever green indoor lights, by the way,
[54:45.290 --> 54:48.250]  that we were talking about earlier that I literally parked. And if you want to get,
[54:48.250 --> 54:53.370]  if you could go back to that picture, um, that the lights I measured were six inches above that plant.
[54:54.250 --> 55:07.620]  If that, wow. Yeah. Well, um, are we ready to transition to, um, the bastard? I mean, we can,
[55:07.620 --> 55:11.140]  unless there's a lot of questions that pop up in the chat or if, you know, either one of you
[55:11.140 --> 55:15.780]  gentlemen have questions about the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,
[55:16.260 --> 55:18.900]  the, the questions about autos or something. That's like been tingling in the back of your mind.
[55:20.820 --> 55:25.140]  So, uh, so, sorry, Robert, you are quite chatty in the chat right now.
[55:25.700 --> 55:33.220]  He has another question. 60 days. Yes. From the time it breaks the soil and puts out its,
[55:33.220 --> 55:36.900]  you know, first set of leaves to the time that you're running, you know,
[55:36.900 --> 55:44.180]  you can chop that thing in 60 days. It moves quick and the fun thing about this,
[55:44.180 --> 55:49.460]  it's entertaining to watch because you get some pretty rapid growth. It sexes in anywhere
[55:49.460 --> 55:55.380]  between 10 and 13 days and the plant is relatively still small. What's that?
[55:55.380 --> 56:00.540]  For all of us breeders out there, just to kind of go back, if I bought a pack of Bobby's
[56:00.540 --> 56:09.820]  Widow and I opened it up into a room full of my favorite photo periods, in about three
[56:09.820 --> 56:17.220]  generations post that, I could potentially have an auto line of those photo periods.
[56:17.220 --> 56:20.300]  You could as long as, yeah, I mean, you're going to have, you'll have a high number of
[56:20.300 --> 56:23.700]  the auto flowering trait. I don't know if you would call it like exactly what you want.
[56:23.700 --> 56:27.380]  I think by three, you're going to see a lot of auto flowers with a lot of phenotypical
[56:27.380 --> 56:30.780]  expressions because now you're bringing that gene into dominance with the other genes you
[56:30.780 --> 56:35.300]  brought into the photo period. So at the F3 stage, you're going to see a lot of auto flowering,
[56:35.500 --> 56:41.420]  but you're not going to see a lot of stability amongst the female plants. So that's why I
[56:41.420 --> 56:44.900]  would say, you know, take a couple more generations before you actually find what you want. At
[56:44.900 --> 56:47.300]  that point, you can really hone in and say, look, we were talking the other day, I want
[56:47.300 --> 56:53.500]  a root beer or I want a testarosa or a runt's auto. I think you're going to find the phenotypes
[56:53.500 --> 56:56.880]  within the F3 that you're looking for, but not all of them are going to be the same.
[56:56.880 --> 57:00.500]  You're not going to find 16 or 17 of them that are going to be identical like that until
[57:00.500 --> 57:05.780]  you jump a few more generations where you find that matching male F3 and female F3 that
[57:05.780 --> 57:08.940]  you really like and kind of introduce them to each other.
[57:10.460 --> 57:13.540]  OK, so I've teed up the next one.
[57:16.060 --> 57:21.260]  So I'll have you, I don't know if you can change those titles on the fly, but I had a
[57:21.260 --> 57:23.980]  chuckle at this yesterday. The C actually stands for cannabis.
[57:24.820 --> 57:25.940]  So, yeah.
[57:26.700 --> 57:29.820]  Which is, you know, I got a good chuckle about it.
[57:29.860 --> 57:31.580]  The Australian bastard cannabis.
[57:32.500 --> 57:34.540]  So I hadn't smoked enough weed that day.
[57:34.620 --> 57:35.620]  That was a problem.
[57:38.540 --> 57:41.700]  So, yeah, that sparked my interest a couple of years back.
[57:42.660 --> 57:45.420]  I'm a huge fan of leaf mutations.
[57:45.980 --> 57:49.220]  One of the things I really like looking for are mutations.
[57:49.460 --> 57:51.380]  Freak Show is one of the ones I like to see.
[57:51.380 --> 57:53.060]  You know, of course, we've all been around Duxfoot.
[57:53.060 --> 57:55.060]  Duxfoot's been around for a really, really long time.
[57:56.460 --> 58:02.420]  I get a cloven leaf trait in the outline, which is basically the fan leaves instead of
[58:02.420 --> 58:05.340]  coming back and grouping at the palm like they typically do.
[58:05.740 --> 58:09.940]  They actually have a split where the middle leaf is singular by itself and then your
[58:09.940 --> 58:11.500]  side leaves are in sets of twos.
[58:11.940 --> 58:13.900]  So it's a pretty unique expression.
[58:13.900 --> 58:16.500]  And that kind of turned me on to leaf mutations.
[58:16.500 --> 58:20.700]  And then I saw this Australian bastard cannabis.
[58:20.700 --> 58:25.340]  And as you can see, the initial set of leaves don't look anything like it should.
[58:25.340 --> 58:26.500]  Everything else does.
[58:26.820 --> 58:29.260]  But that mutation starts right at the beginning.
[58:30.340 --> 58:32.500]  And I had to have it.
[58:32.820 --> 58:36.460]  There were people in the States already working with it and they had it.
[58:37.180 --> 58:38.660]  And I'm not sure how they acquired it.
[58:40.140 --> 58:45.020]  But I fortunately have a very dear friend that lives in Australia and I sent him on a
[58:45.020 --> 58:48.100]  hunt. I will do this swap with.
[58:49.460 --> 58:51.060]  This almost looks like basil.
[58:51.500 --> 58:54.700]  It it way to get into the deeper pictures.
[58:54.700 --> 59:00.220]  Like it like the flowers and like it doesn't grow traditionally, it just pushes out.
[59:00.220 --> 59:01.460]  It's literally bushweed.
[59:03.660 --> 59:06.500]  And so I sent him on a hunt and said, listen, if you can get these, I'll send you some
[59:06.500 --> 59:09.780]  of my stuff that I hold in prize.
[59:09.780 --> 59:11.420]  I need to get my hand on this for two reasons.
[59:11.420 --> 59:12.380]  One, the mutation.
[59:12.740 --> 59:16.460]  And I would love to see it in an auto form, because let's face it, the whole reason
[59:16.460 --> 59:21.940]  people started even looking at us was covert operational, you know, something that
[59:22.100 --> 59:25.220]  doesn't look like weed or just stays smaller and quicker and it's done and out of the
[59:25.220 --> 59:30.180]  way. And then I think with the two between an auto and this, it would really give some
[59:30.900 --> 59:36.100]  versatility. I mean, it it almost looks novelty, you know, and I think that appeals to a
[59:36.100 --> 59:39.420]  lot of people. A lot of people like to see things that aren't normal, that aren't the
[59:39.420 --> 59:41.220]  same staple that you see every day.
[59:42.060 --> 59:46.460]  These were sourced from an area called Never Never, which is near Thor, New South
[59:46.460 --> 59:51.700]  Wales. It's on the eastern coast side, I believe, of Australia.
[59:52.900 --> 59:55.620]  And yeah, so it took about a year before I heard anything back.
[59:55.620 --> 59:56.900]  I mean, we had chatted a little bit.
[59:56.940 --> 59:59.460]  He kept running up on, you know, dead ends.
[59:59.460 --> 01:00:02.340]  And finally, a year later, he's like, hey, we found it.
[01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:05.980]  And this was the result of it.
[01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:09.940]  They sent me I had 20 seeds to work with that because that's all he could find at the
[01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:14.140]  time, because apparently it's held pretty close to the chest over there.
[01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:20.180]  You know, once he gets like it's a type of thing that was hard to get to, but a lot of
[01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:23.500]  people want to grow it. And I think one of the big reasons he got it was he would like
[01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:28.100]  to see it shared amongst the masses rather than just hoard it back and then potentially
[01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:30.940]  lost. You know, the whole goal is to start out as a preservation.
[01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:34.660]  And as I was posting it, you know, the demand started going up.
[01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:36.100]  I started getting more questions.
[01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:37.860]  And then, you know, I talked to the original guys over there.
[01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:39.060]  It's like, are you OK with this?
[01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:40.820]  You know, comes back to the ethics for me.
[01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:43.020]  And they're like, we were hoping that you were going to do so.
[01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:46.020]  I wasn't going to do so without the permission of the people that sourced it for me.
[01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:50.180]  And they want we wanted to work it into an auto line.
[01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:51.980]  I'm working it into an auto line right now.
[01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:54.460]  I actually use something different that I typically don't do.
[01:00:54.460 --> 01:00:59.340]  I had a beautiful male from the ABC and I introduced it into my auto lines this summer at
[01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:05.860]  the same time. So I now have an F1 hybrid of a male ABC and then one of my larger autos
[01:01:06.220 --> 01:01:14.420]  that I'm hoping to increase the density with and drop the leaf to K-ratio and have
[01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:16.620]  something a little bit more covert and unique to grow in your garden.
[01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:28.020]  But it's a, you know, an indigenous plant that showed up there.
[01:01:28.220 --> 01:01:32.180]  I don't think it shows up anywhere else in the world, honestly.
[01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:34.140]  They don't really know the origins from what I understand.
[01:01:34.140 --> 01:01:36.140]  I try to get as much backstory as I can from them.
[01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:39.420]  But yeah, it's super interesting to watch grow.
[01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:40.500]  It pushes out really nice.
[01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:41.780]  It doesn't grow traditionally.
[01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:46.660]  Instead of having main large colas, it's got these bud sites everywhere with barely any
[01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:50.300]  leaf material to trim off when you're done, especially when you let it finish.
[01:01:50.580 --> 01:01:52.460]  Takes about nine weeks to flower out.
[01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:58.340]  I was told 10 to 11, but the speed that I saw here and that was from the seed material,
[01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:00.220]  I like to let them go longer, was about nine weeks.
[01:02:00.820 --> 01:02:04.620]  So I could see these finishing in eight to nine weeks and they will need 12-12.
[01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:05.740]  They are not an auto flower.
[01:02:05.740 --> 01:02:07.780]  Let's get that out there because we've talked about both sides.
[01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:10.140]  This responds to photo period.
[01:02:13.780 --> 01:02:14.940]  What are the flavors?
[01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:19.220]  So the primary flavors I was getting out this, I would say, and I may pronounce this
[01:02:19.220 --> 01:02:23.860]  wrong, so don't stab me, lima bean and that burnt rubber smell that we've smelled on a
[01:02:23.860 --> 01:02:25.140]  few of the ones that you've had, Josh.
[01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:29.300]  Primary lemon was coming out of the heaviest.
[01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:31.980]  The smoke was very uplifting.
[01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:38.620]  It has a very sativa effect, not like landslide, Chernobyl style, but like I got an
[01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:39.620]  uptick in energy.
[01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:43.260]  I didn't feel any kind of couch lock or any kind of body sedation from it, but it
[01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:45.140]  definitely has an uplifting sativa effect.
[01:02:45.140 --> 01:02:46.460]  It's not super potent yet.
[01:02:47.780 --> 01:02:49.340]  It's in land race.
[01:02:50.220 --> 01:02:51.660]  It needs a little bit of work.
[01:02:52.220 --> 01:02:54.700]  And I think there are some guys out there right now that are working on it on the
[01:02:54.700 --> 01:02:55.660]  photo period side.
[01:02:55.660 --> 01:02:58.300]  I know CSI Humboldt, those guys are working on it.
[01:02:58.740 --> 01:03:03.300]  They got a triangle, I do believe is what it was that they're working on.
[01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:05.860]  It's been fun to watch them work with that.
[01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:10.020]  So a lot of there are a few other big guys that are working with this stuff.
[01:03:10.060 --> 01:03:14.380]  And I saw that one thing pop up about cover grows and it'd be nice to just put them
[01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:17.100]  out and not have to worry about having a cover over them.
[01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:22.100]  Super mold and mildew resistant, which is really nice, especially for our area, Josh.
[01:03:22.980 --> 01:03:27.180]  The mold and mildew thing, I'm really hoping to bring in to the auto side, you know,
[01:03:27.180 --> 01:03:30.340]  bring in its leaf trait, bring in its mold and mildew resistance and bring in its
[01:03:30.860 --> 01:03:31.460]  uniqueness.
[01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:43.660]  Now, see, we all have little ones.
[01:03:47.420 --> 01:03:51.580]  Gemma's Gemma, what's going on in your life today?
[01:03:51.580 --> 01:03:54.460]  There's a phone that we're charging.
[01:03:54.460 --> 01:04:01.180]  Yeah, she has a non-functioning phone that she is charging and very excited about.
[01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:05.340]  Gemma, make yourself, you're like a cat, like climbing onto my lap and.
[01:04:07.060 --> 01:04:07.980]  OK, snuck right up.
[01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:08.660]  No, don't.
[01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:10.220]  Yeah, Gemma, the one.
[01:04:10.220 --> 01:04:11.260]  Ah, stop.
[01:04:11.620 --> 01:04:12.140]  My God.
[01:04:13.540 --> 01:04:14.700]  OK, OK.
[01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:15.940]  Done, done, done, done, done.
[01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:17.260]  Ha ha.
[01:04:18.780 --> 01:04:19.380]  All right.
[01:04:19.580 --> 01:04:21.540]  They're bouncing off the walls right now.
[01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:23.180]  Oh, yeah.
[01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:27.540]  Yeah.
[01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:30.340]  Sorry, I'm looking through the comments.
[01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:31.900]  So any questions on.
[01:04:35.020 --> 01:04:36.460]  The bastard cannabis.
[01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:45.220]  Crickets, let's see.
[01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:46.340]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:50.180]  I got to say, I'm really interested to grow them just that I was showing my wife the
[01:04:50.180 --> 01:04:54.740]  pictures today and it's just like, holy shit, that looks nothing like we.
[01:04:55.140 --> 01:04:56.060]  Just the structure.
[01:04:56.140 --> 01:04:57.460]  I mean, I did some.
[01:04:57.860 --> 01:05:04.660]  I did something with Jordan from Freak, the guy behind Freak Show with he was at Nat
[01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:10.780]  Pennington's house and they were basically like Fino hunting and sitting around a
[01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:17.460]  table. And then they brought me like out to the garden and were like showing me Nat's
[01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:21.700]  breeding setup, which is she's quite nice.
[01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:24.460]  I mean, we all have a setup like that one day.
[01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:26.500]  Yeah. Someone said cross for the Freak Show.
[01:05:28.700 --> 01:05:31.340]  Yeah, I've seen I've seen a few folks are actually talking about it.
[01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:35.060]  There's a gentleman in northern Washington, actually, Josh, near you.
[01:05:36.060 --> 01:05:39.540]  I've gotten some of his stuff that he's worked with Duck Web, but he's done an ABC
[01:05:39.540 --> 01:05:41.220]  Freak Show cross that he's been working on.
[01:05:42.140 --> 01:05:43.500]  I mean, you need to see what that does.
[01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:45.980]  Is that Sunnyland?
[01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:47.900]  Yeah, I think he is listening.
[01:05:47.900 --> 01:05:48.660]  Is that Sunnyland?
[01:05:49.260 --> 01:05:50.060]  Yeah. Yeah.
[01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:51.100]  Yep.
[01:05:52.100 --> 01:05:54.460]  Oh, yeah, he was Sunnyland.
[01:05:54.460 --> 01:05:59.660]  Let's. Yeah, I posted something from Sunnyland a while ago.
[01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:02.900]  Yeah, he's got some nice stuff.
[01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:04.620]  He's a he's a mutant fan as well.
[01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:06.460]  He's got some he's got I got said.
[01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:13.420]  Yeah, he was going to he was going to donate some seeds for the Leo Fund.
[01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:15.020]  We're working on hooking up.
[01:06:15.460 --> 01:06:19.740]  But he said here, I noticed ABC doesn't play nice with other leaf shapes, meaning
[01:06:19.740 --> 01:06:20.540]  like the duck.
[01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:28.540]  Interesting, it'll be fun to watch, I think that's what I'm excited about the most
[01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:33.780]  is I made a decent amount of seed from the auto ABC cross, and I'm really curious to
[01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:35.900]  see what comes out of that in the first round.
[01:06:35.940 --> 01:06:36.860]  So you got a dominant.
[01:06:36.860 --> 01:06:39.900]  See if that you know that leaf trait comes out.
[01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:41.900]  That's the exciting part for me is being a breeder.
[01:06:43.540 --> 01:06:44.820]  Yes, you can train the ABC.
[01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:49.380]  You can train it. You can trim it just like any other prune it like any other cannabis
[01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:50.140]  plant if you want to.
[01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:55.980]  I would probably recommend it, to be completely honest with you, because if you
[01:06:55.980 --> 01:06:58.420]  don't, by the time you hang dry it, it looks like a tumbleweed.
[01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:03.380]  So I would probably recommend training it and cutting off some of the side branching
[01:07:03.380 --> 01:07:04.340]  because it just goes berserk.
[01:07:08.820 --> 01:07:11.140]  And I lost my train of thought, I answer that question, sorry, gentlemen.
[01:07:12.980 --> 01:07:13.580]  It's OK.
[01:07:16.260 --> 01:07:19.980]  Oh, we're talking about leaf mutations, yeah, just kind of hope to see.
[01:07:20.220 --> 01:07:22.900]  I'm looking forward to that, looking forward to see what comes out because, you
[01:07:22.900 --> 01:07:27.020]  know, the the day neutral trait that makes a lot of flowers, a lot of flowers are
[01:07:27.020 --> 01:07:28.020]  recessive trait too.
[01:07:29.220 --> 01:07:30.420]  So we'll see what's going to play.
[01:07:34.550 --> 01:07:35.830]  How much does it stretch?
[01:07:36.430 --> 01:07:38.150]  A pretty good bit, actually.
[01:07:38.550 --> 01:07:43.230]  It puts some serious space in between its inner nodes during the stretch.
[01:07:43.230 --> 01:07:45.790]  It doesn't stretch super tall to where it can't support itself.
[01:07:46.030 --> 01:07:51.270]  But what you'll notice as it's entering the flower phase, it will still kind of
[01:07:51.270 --> 01:07:55.190]  continue to stretch beyond the swell point.
[01:07:55.270 --> 01:07:58.150]  It wanted to keep kind of stretching itself out there.
[01:07:58.550 --> 01:08:02.310]  And, you know, I was taking late reading meetings to make sure that, you know, I
[01:08:02.310 --> 01:08:05.030]  didn't have my lights too high and making sure that everything was going fine.
[01:08:05.030 --> 01:08:08.910]  And the seedlings that were sitting around that plant, you know, weren't hitting that
[01:08:08.910 --> 01:08:12.030]  ninth inning stretch where they needed some kind of support.
[01:08:12.230 --> 01:08:13.910]  So I knew my lighting was good.
[01:08:14.310 --> 01:08:17.830]  But yeah, they kind of have a weird stretch there at the first section of flower from
[01:08:17.830 --> 01:08:18.190]  what I've seen.
[01:08:19.190 --> 01:08:23.470]  But they're not going to get you're not going to see these things, especially the
[01:08:23.470 --> 01:08:24.630]  variety that I'm releasing.
[01:08:24.630 --> 01:08:27.350]  I don't see you seeing it stretch over five, six foot.
[01:08:27.390 --> 01:08:30.310]  It's not I mean, you could be growing in a tent indoor and a four foot tent.
[01:08:30.350 --> 01:08:33.070]  I think it's fine, especially having your lights all the way at the top.
[01:08:34.470 --> 01:08:38.110]  There's just a general breeding autos question.
[01:08:40.030 --> 01:08:40.550]  So.
[01:08:42.310 --> 01:08:47.230]  Up until years ago, you would get it from either pure root arousal or somebody who
[01:08:47.230 --> 01:08:50.630]  has gotten pure root arousal, you got F1, F2, maybe F3 seeds.
[01:08:52.110 --> 01:08:57.310]  And then the feminized wave hit and regulars kind of went to the wayside.
[01:08:57.750 --> 01:09:02.110]  And so I am one of a handful.
[01:09:02.110 --> 01:09:05.750]  I don't know if there are many other than three or four guys that release auto regs
[01:09:06.670 --> 01:09:07.670]  to seed banks anyway.
[01:09:07.670 --> 01:09:09.190]  There may be some private guys that do.
[01:09:09.190 --> 01:09:12.950]  There may be some Facebook groups or other kind of groups that guys that have got
[01:09:12.990 --> 01:09:16.070]  auto regulars that release them.
[01:09:17.070 --> 01:09:21.630]  But that gives you the ability to do it now from auto to auto so you don't have to
[01:09:21.630 --> 01:09:25.990]  work for it. But most of the original stuff came from like Siberia.
[01:09:27.110 --> 01:09:28.670]  And I got a few other locations, too.
[01:09:28.670 --> 01:09:30.230]  I can't pronounce them, so I don't want to sound like an idiot.
[01:09:43.820 --> 01:09:47.980]  Yeah, people are talking about crossing that with Freak Show with every other.
[01:09:48.860 --> 01:09:50.900]  Oh, yeah. Any other mutation that could.
[01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:52.180]  Yeah.
[01:09:53.940 --> 01:09:55.460]  Freak Show is very interesting to see.
[01:09:55.460 --> 01:09:57.420]  I got to see it up close and personal this year.
[01:09:59.980 --> 01:10:01.580]  And I walked by it.
[01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:05.620]  I literally walked by it and didn't I didn't know what I saw.
[01:10:06.100 --> 01:10:09.820]  Like, you know, you walk into like somebody has a couple planted in their flower beds
[01:10:09.820 --> 01:10:11.740]  or something like that, you can pick out campus anywhere.
[01:10:11.740 --> 01:10:12.740]  You know that leaf pattern.
[01:10:13.380 --> 01:10:16.340]  I walk. I mean, literally was looking at all the different herbs and spices and he
[01:10:16.340 --> 01:10:17.940]  laughed at me. We got to and he said, you missed it.
[01:10:18.700 --> 01:10:22.100]  So what do you mean? Walked back and sure it was number two in his line.
[01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:23.340]  It was female freak show.
[01:10:23.380 --> 01:10:25.420]  Wasn't in flower yet, but it looked like a fern.
[01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:34.540]  And then here is a question for you.
[01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:40.480]  I can't see the bottom side of it.
[01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:45.560]  Do you get bummed if some random chucker uses your gear for a cross?
[01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:50.800]  If I got upset about that release in regulars, I mean, that's what Josh was talking
[01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:52.160]  about earlier. It's going to happen.
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:54.720]  I've seen guys have done it.
[01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:59.520]  I've watched guys try to they've, you know, taken the anvil and they've crossed it to
[01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:04.120]  another dark cultivar. And, you know, now they've got these F1 seeds that they want to
[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:07.560]  put out to people. And one of the big things is not caution people here.
[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:11.240]  One of the things as a breeder and Josh, I talked about this in extent.
[01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:18.040]  Breeding against feminized auto with a regular auto can get a little funky in the
[01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:23.320]  park. Your F1s are going to show some really bad
[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:28.560]  hermaphroditic traits, and I have seen it multiple times on different strains that I've
[01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:31.880]  tried that with just to make sure it was something stressing in the environment.
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:35.520]  And I've seen Hermes both ways because of it.
[01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:40.320]  I see females that go great and then not just put out bananas, but literally start
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:43.200]  internal flowering of pollen sacks.
[01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:47.360]  And then I've seen males that turn around and they look male for a while.
[01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:49.800]  And all of a sudden they're actually throwing on an internode.
[01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:51.720]  They're starting to flower like a female.
[01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:55.680]  And I think it's something to do with the reintroduction of the male chromosome.
[01:11:56.680 --> 01:12:01.320]  I'm coming off that line because this feminized seeds are probably have been, you
[01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:04.600]  know, two or three, maybe even four generations feminized, and then you're chucking
[01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:07.640]  back in regular genetics and pollen.
[01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:09.280]  I think something there does.
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:11.760]  I don't understand the breakdown of genetics.
[01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:16.360]  I know how to, you know, use the square, you know, the Punnett squares and the
[01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:20.800]  Mendel squares to figure out what I'm going for, but why that's happening, I'm not
[01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:29.200]  100 percent certain. So that's something to watch out for.
[01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:33.000]  That's why you're always kind of taking the photos.
[01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:38.000]  Like if you want to bring traits in, you're more than not bringing photo traits in and
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.360]  working those into autos.
[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:44.640]  Yeah, I mean, I've worked some autocross and they're OK, but I've worked with
[01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:49.000]  regulars and then I wanted to see there was a couple other fems that I had that I
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:50.760]  wanted. I like their potential.
[01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:54.480]  And then that's when I started seeing the weird stuff show up.
[01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:58.360]  You know, I was like, OK, I didn't see this from reg to reg or photo to reg.
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:04.080]  But seeing it with feminized female and regular male pollen, and that could happen in
[01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:08.400]  photo period, too. I would assume it would, but it's something I definitely see in the
[01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:13.440]  auto world. Do you see do you see that comment from Rob?
[01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:15.480]  Hey, what's up, Rob?
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:19.680]  Everybody's got kids.
[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:25.600]  Yeah. Oh, yeah. I see.
[01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:26.760]  So, yeah, we have talked.
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:28.600]  He's been over a couple of times.
[01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:33.000]  So I had the pleasure of meeting Rob very early on, moving to Washington, actually got
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:36.760]  to sit down in Seattle or come with him, have some coffee and we caught up because he
[01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:41.080]  caught wind of me coming up as a breeder and was like, hey, I like what's going on.
[01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:42.160]  And we just kind of hit it off.
[01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:47.400]  You know, I mean, the early days it was Ruter Alice and low rider.
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.880]  If you could get your hands on the land race route or Alice, because it was kind of
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:52.880]  like the ABC, you know, people were kind of hoarding it.
[01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:53.960]  Nobody knew what to really do it.
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.080]  People are paying that much attention.
[01:13:58.900 --> 01:14:00.660]  The cannabinoid profile.
[01:14:02.660 --> 01:14:07.180]  Waiting on sealers and I guess the team, yeah, to teach strength, like I was saying
[01:14:07.180 --> 01:14:10.860]  earlier, it's not, you know, it's not going to be twenty, twenty three percent or
[01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:13.180]  higher like we see or even into the 30s like we see.
[01:14:14.020 --> 01:14:18.020]  It's just not been assisted by human hand and hasn't been selected for those traces.
[01:14:18.060 --> 01:14:24.020]  Again, started off as a preservation project that's turned into a demand and, you
[01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:25.780]  know, seeing something come out of the wild.
[01:14:25.940 --> 01:14:27.460]  And that's what fascinated me the most.
[01:14:27.460 --> 01:14:32.300]  And I think this will help these growers like bringing something out of the wild
[01:14:32.340 --> 01:14:36.500]  that's literally not been exposed to artificial lighting, let alone some of the
[01:14:36.500 --> 01:14:42.500]  intensity of the LED and grow techniques and just complete, you know, not what
[01:14:42.780 --> 01:14:44.700]  unnatural environments for them.
[01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:50.020]  And this thing responded to LED like it had been grown underneath it for years.
[01:14:51.060 --> 01:14:54.380]  And the reason I can give that as an example is because my Durban cut or actually I
[01:14:54.420 --> 01:14:59.900]  had my Durban was from seed and then my Durban clones absolutely positively hated
[01:15:00.060 --> 01:15:03.540]  LED like they did not respond well to LED at all.
[01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:05.820]  Leaf roll. We had twisting.
[01:15:05.860 --> 01:15:07.260]  I couldn't get to perk up.
[01:15:07.300 --> 01:15:09.580]  It would not pray and didn't matter what I threw at it.
[01:15:09.860 --> 01:15:11.620]  That Durban absolutely hated life.
[01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:14.740]  When it got to the point where our daylight hours were here, we're long enough to put
[01:15:14.740 --> 01:15:16.420]  it outside without risk of revenge.
[01:15:18.060 --> 01:15:20.500]  Three days it turned around and it took off.
[01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:26.540]  So, you know, it's interesting to see how some of those will handle it fine and then
[01:15:26.540 --> 01:15:32.250]  others don't. I appreciate that.
[01:15:42.260 --> 01:15:44.900]  Yes, it takes time, DM.
[01:15:44.940 --> 01:15:49.820]  It takes a lot of time. That's when you got to start introducing manual stressors,
[01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:55.780]  focusing on the male. That's typically where I do the heaviest part of my stress
[01:15:55.780 --> 01:16:00.420]  testing, because Rude Rallis does like to hermaphrodite earlier on sometimes.
[01:16:00.580 --> 01:16:02.820]  And I think it's just a sex stability thing.
[01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:05.860]  The.
[01:16:08.060 --> 01:16:09.060]  What's that?
[01:16:10.740 --> 01:16:14.820]  Yeah. So Gemma drew that and someone said that's a spitting image of me.
[01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:16.700]  That's terrible.
[01:16:17.020 --> 01:16:20.140]  With the glasses and the stubble.
[01:16:21.540 --> 01:16:23.740]  Nice. I like her attention to detail.
[01:16:24.420 --> 01:16:25.420]  Yeah.
[01:16:32.860 --> 01:16:34.860]  Lisa's battery is dying.
[01:16:37.100 --> 01:16:38.260]  Say that again, Josh.
[01:16:39.020 --> 01:16:41.620]  Someone was asking about heat stress testing.
[01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:49.980]  Yeah, heat stress, light cycle changes, overwater, underwater, rough transplant, which
[01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:52.900]  I've made a few growers sick watching me do it.
[01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:56.020]  But if it's going to herm, it's going to herm at that point.
[01:16:57.180 --> 01:16:58.780]  And what I mean by that is I'll get a male.
[01:16:58.780 --> 01:17:01.260]  It's nice. He's starting to he's not quite opened up yet.
[01:17:01.260 --> 01:17:05.100]  His pre flowers may be opened up, but I'll literally grab him by the base.
[01:17:05.140 --> 01:17:08.260]  And it sounds horrific and pull him directly out of the soil.
[01:17:08.740 --> 01:17:11.500]  And then I will put him right into another pot of soil.
[01:17:12.460 --> 01:17:15.700]  Folds leaves in for a couple of days if he makes it through the process.
[01:17:15.700 --> 01:17:21.500]  Cool. But the guy has to make it through the process and not reverse on me.
[01:17:21.860 --> 01:17:23.780]  And usually that's where you'll see it.
[01:17:23.780 --> 01:17:26.740]  If you don't see it there, you'll see it with light cycle changing.
[01:17:26.740 --> 01:17:33.220]  And what I mean by that is low, high, low, 18, six for a majority of its life.
[01:17:33.660 --> 01:17:38.220]  Bump it up to 24 or 24 for a couple of weeks and then drop it back down to 18, six.
[01:17:38.700 --> 01:17:43.580]  And that's how they used to feminize out is back in the old school day before silver
[01:17:43.580 --> 01:17:45.580]  thyrus, all things cool, you know, cool, silver.
[01:17:45.940 --> 01:17:50.140]  Like that's what they were going off of was a light stressor to either self the
[01:17:50.140 --> 01:17:56.020]  females that were, you know, throwing the the bananas, but a stamp or pollinate the
[01:17:56.100 --> 01:17:59.540]  females that were in the room that handled the stress about reversing on them.
[01:18:01.420 --> 01:18:07.340]  We've talked about this a lot on the phone and just this stress testing and all that
[01:18:07.340 --> 01:18:13.100]  you just ran through is just not done by people, you know, in a lot of people that
[01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:15.980]  are putting gear out there, you know, they end up having.
[01:18:16.180 --> 01:18:17.580]  I think this is my conclusion.
[01:18:17.620 --> 01:18:18.860]  You know, I can't speak for everybody.
[01:18:18.860 --> 01:18:22.940]  I think the reason is because people have unfortunately small spaces because of
[01:18:22.940 --> 01:18:25.660]  prohibition. They can't run large numbers.
[01:18:26.020 --> 01:18:31.140]  So that they end up making sacrifices for traits that they would rather not make
[01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:35.260]  those sacrifice because they want the thing that's good about the variety and they
[01:18:35.260 --> 01:18:36.460]  have a large population.
[01:18:36.460 --> 01:18:40.780]  And so they, you know, I mean, like it's a huge part of when you start talking about
[01:18:40.780 --> 01:18:43.100]  pulling males out, that's exactly my process.
[01:18:43.100 --> 01:18:48.620]  I take them all the way to flower and I rip them out and I put them in a small pot and
[01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:49.860]  back it in. And whoever makes.
[01:18:50.820 --> 01:18:55.900]  And the rebadges, you know, I take them, treat them as best I can to do that.
[01:18:55.940 --> 01:19:00.820]  That's a huge process and you lose at least half in the process of it, you know, and
[01:19:00.820 --> 01:19:02.380]  then another half in the revenge.
[01:19:03.220 --> 01:19:04.660]  And I don't know.
[01:19:04.860 --> 01:19:08.420]  I just this speaks to like the work you're doing that you're putting all that hell on
[01:19:08.420 --> 01:19:10.660]  them, you know. Well, I appreciate that.
[01:19:10.660 --> 01:19:12.340]  And I think that's that's the goal.
[01:19:13.340 --> 01:19:18.620]  And speaking of the work you put into it, do you have a pack within reach so we can
[01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:20.340]  see the packaging?
[01:19:21.020 --> 01:19:22.300]  I actually I do not.
[01:19:22.940 --> 01:19:24.140]  I wish I did.
[01:19:24.140 --> 01:19:26.540]  He has actually really beautiful packaging.
[01:19:27.340 --> 01:19:28.740]  It's maybe it's morphing.
[01:19:28.740 --> 01:19:30.060]  So I won't say too much.
[01:19:30.060 --> 01:19:31.460]  Go ahead. You can talk about it.
[01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:33.660]  Yeah, I mean, I'm not going to morph it yet.
[01:19:33.660 --> 01:19:35.580]  It's going to I'm going to do some changes.
[01:19:35.580 --> 01:19:38.020]  But basically what it is, it's a black ring box.
[01:19:38.020 --> 01:19:40.460]  I've got a glass vial.
[01:19:40.460 --> 01:19:44.620]  It's inside. Of course, it's protected my labels on the top description on the back.
[01:19:44.620 --> 01:19:46.660]  And then I wax seal each individual one of them.
[01:19:46.940 --> 01:19:51.020]  So it's a nice, you know, I think they're like two by two little ring box and it comes
[01:19:51.020 --> 01:19:52.140]  in packaged and sealed.
[01:19:52.140 --> 01:19:55.100]  It keeps the seeds from rattling around, keeps the glass vial from breaking.
[01:19:55.460 --> 01:19:58.220]  And I, you know, Josh touched on it there.
[01:19:58.220 --> 01:20:03.060]  He said, you know, hey, you put a lot of work into the breeding and selection process.
[01:20:03.060 --> 01:20:06.660]  I didn't I wanted that to trickle into my presentation.
[01:20:06.860 --> 01:20:08.620]  You know, presentation, I believe, is everything.
[01:20:09.660 --> 01:20:12.140]  I am a packaging.
[01:20:12.300 --> 01:20:18.260]  I hate to say a packaging whore, like walking through a store, something is neatly
[01:20:18.260 --> 01:20:20.260]  packaged or it's displayed good.
[01:20:20.260 --> 01:20:23.620]  It it'll catch my eye over another product that I'm used to using.
[01:20:23.980 --> 01:20:27.740]  And I'm not saying that I'm trying to steal away from anybody, but like I went at my
[01:20:27.740 --> 01:20:29.060]  packaging with that in mind.
[01:20:29.340 --> 01:20:32.140]  Like, wait a minute, that's put together really nicely.
[01:20:32.380 --> 01:20:35.260]  There must be some kind of care behind it or just be a marketing ploy.
[01:20:35.540 --> 01:20:41.740]  But as far as like other vendors, but like, you know, I just wanted the work to resound
[01:20:41.740 --> 01:20:43.500]  all the way down into the presentation for the end user.
[01:20:45.980 --> 01:20:49.860]  And just to finish my thought back, you know.
[01:20:53.500 --> 01:20:57.260]  You've been a patient, you are not a commercial grower, you don't have commercial
[01:20:57.260 --> 01:21:00.780]  space. I know you've worked a little bit with some commercial guys, but you're doing
[01:21:00.780 --> 01:21:03.060]  this as a medical patient with the plant count.
[01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:06.140]  And it's just really impressive.
[01:21:06.140 --> 01:21:09.220]  It's because it's taking you a lot, a lot of time to do this work.
[01:21:09.940 --> 01:21:13.980]  And to be able to do that and put all that stressor through it, it takes a lot of
[01:21:13.980 --> 01:21:16.940]  patience to do that.
[01:21:17.940 --> 01:21:22.540]  Well, and I want to thank people, too, because like people get frustrated because they
[01:21:22.540 --> 01:21:25.500]  can't get anvil right now. People get frustrated because they can't get Alf right now.
[01:21:25.980 --> 01:21:28.460]  And it's a double edged sword.
[01:21:28.460 --> 01:21:29.900]  That's great for me, myself.
[01:21:29.900 --> 01:21:30.820]  You know, it's moving.
[01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:34.660]  But at the same time, people feel left out.
[01:21:35.140 --> 01:21:37.580]  And that's because of what you just said.
[01:21:37.580 --> 01:21:39.700]  You know, I have to I'm doing this within a framework.
[01:21:39.700 --> 01:21:45.260]  So sometimes I can't just go through and boom, boom, boom, bang it out.
[01:21:45.260 --> 01:21:48.220]  I might have a generation. I don't see anything I want that came out stable.
[01:21:48.220 --> 01:21:53.660]  Now, it's easier with anvil and Alf and gem because the work has been done for so
[01:21:53.660 --> 01:21:57.540]  long. There's not too much genetic variety that's coming up in there other than what I
[01:21:57.540 --> 01:22:00.420]  know what I'm looking for. I mean, every now and again you get a few rough types.
[01:22:01.060 --> 01:22:06.140]  But with that said, you know, that's why it takes a little bit longer, because not only
[01:22:06.140 --> 01:22:10.020]  are there stressors, there's the plant count limitation as a medical patient here in
[01:22:10.020 --> 01:22:12.980]  Washington. And then I also like environmental changes, too.
[01:22:12.980 --> 01:22:17.100]  I like to cycle indoor, greenhouse and pure outdoor.
[01:22:17.740 --> 01:22:21.300]  You know, like I want to take them all the way through the gambit because not everybody
[01:22:21.300 --> 01:22:22.860]  grows in a living soil like you or I.
[01:22:23.140 --> 01:22:25.100]  Not everybody grows indoor.
[01:22:25.220 --> 01:22:28.660]  Not everybody has the opportunity to run a greenhouse because they've got these other
[01:22:28.660 --> 01:22:30.700]  options and they're stuck to what they can.
[01:22:31.660 --> 01:22:34.220]  Obviously, that's completely different on a commercial scale.
[01:22:34.620 --> 01:22:38.140]  But, you know, I like to cycle through that because some people grow in hydro, some
[01:22:38.140 --> 01:22:41.180]  people grow in living soil, some people do flood and drain.
[01:22:41.180 --> 01:22:45.500]  And my earliest testing part of the days, you know, farm days, these guys were growing
[01:22:45.500 --> 01:22:48.140]  them. I would look for the best growers in the farm.
[01:22:48.180 --> 01:22:49.500]  Hey, here's some free gear.
[01:22:50.780 --> 01:22:52.180]  There's some stuff I'd like you to run.
[01:22:52.180 --> 01:22:56.900]  And then it'd be a deep water culture guy or a guy like the most recent farm that ran
[01:22:57.500 --> 01:22:58.460]  the large scale lobbies.
[01:22:58.460 --> 01:23:02.940]  They're all cocoa. You know, everything's dialed in on, you know, it's all dosed.
[01:23:02.940 --> 01:23:04.620]  It's all watched and stuff like that.
[01:23:04.620 --> 01:23:05.900]  And, you know, they get great.
[01:23:05.900 --> 01:23:08.220]  It actually blew it up bigger than what I thought they would.
[01:23:08.460 --> 01:23:09.940]  They exceeded some expectations for me.
[01:23:09.940 --> 01:23:10.940]  So.
[01:23:12.100 --> 01:23:14.100]  Just quickly a reminder on.
[01:23:16.780 --> 01:23:21.540]  What's more sleep aid and anvil.
[01:23:23.340 --> 01:23:24.980]  I can't even. That's how this started.
[01:23:25.140 --> 01:23:26.700]  That's how this started for you, too.
[01:23:26.700 --> 01:23:27.980]  We didn't even open up with that.
[01:23:27.980 --> 01:23:31.500]  But this I remember now that you got into cannabis, wasn't it?
[01:23:31.500 --> 01:23:34.500]  Growing cannabis for a family member.
[01:23:34.740 --> 01:23:37.300]  It was myself and a family member.
[01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:39.300]  It's for colorectal cancer.
[01:23:39.580 --> 01:23:40.700]  And we all know how that ends.
[01:23:41.380 --> 01:23:45.380]  Sadly, you know, easy life for her type of deal.
[01:23:45.380 --> 01:23:49.540]  And, you know, I started working with a lot of sedative strains, especially after any
[01:23:50.700 --> 01:23:55.300]  indica based lines, because let's face it, they're the heavier carry to that profile.
[01:23:56.100 --> 01:24:00.860]  But if you want something that's sedative and I mean, hands down, I mean, that's
[01:24:01.700 --> 01:24:02.820]  kind of how she got her name.
[01:24:05.580 --> 01:24:10.940]  Just heavy and like I said, and in the evening, I put me to sleep.
[01:24:14.020 --> 01:24:17.700]  Here's a good question. What is the comparison from the coal miners daughter to
[01:24:17.700 --> 01:24:18.700]  Al?
[01:24:19.100 --> 01:24:23.860]  So the again is the stable
[01:24:23.860 --> 01:24:26.060]  line. I do a lot of typical isolation.
[01:24:27.300 --> 01:24:30.180]  And what I mean by that is that's what gives me my stability that I was putting on
[01:24:30.180 --> 01:24:34.380]  earlier. So earlier on in the game, I got it like at the F3 point we were talking
[01:24:34.380 --> 01:24:37.140]  about, you know, photo to autocrosses, you're going to get phenotypes everywhere.
[01:24:37.700 --> 01:24:42.340]  And I found several matching parents of what I really liked by her profile,
[01:24:42.620 --> 01:24:44.580]  by color and by balance.
[01:24:44.900 --> 01:24:49.660]  And the coin or his daughter is basically the reverse of Anvil, so
[01:24:49.660 --> 01:24:54.100]  to speak. So instead of having purple buds and slightly tinge purple leaves to green
[01:24:54.100 --> 01:24:58.780]  leaves in the fall colors, she's a heavier, hashier plant and she's got the black
[01:24:58.820 --> 01:25:03.180]  leaf trait to where it actually as it finishes flower, the plant goes extremely black.
[01:25:04.500 --> 01:25:09.060]  The buds are highlighted with colors of purple and some dark reds,
[01:25:09.060 --> 01:25:13.540]  but it doesn't get as deep, solid trend, you know.
[01:25:14.980 --> 01:25:19.780]  That deep, dark color purple that Anvil gets like Anvil's trichrome stocks
[01:25:19.780 --> 01:25:24.300]  as well as the heads all turn purple to I'm starting to see guys press out
[01:25:24.300 --> 01:25:27.700]  purple rosin from it, which is a beautiful thing to see and it lets me know that my
[01:25:27.900 --> 01:25:31.580]  anthracite and levels are getting high inside that plant to carry it up through the
[01:25:31.580 --> 01:25:34.300]  tricot stocks up into the tricots, kind of like what Pinkleberry does.
[01:25:34.300 --> 01:25:37.300]  I've seen Pinkleberry come out pink and it's pretty hash and I've definitely seen
[01:25:37.300 --> 01:25:39.340]  Pinkleberry get washed. It looks like Kool-Aid.
[01:25:42.220 --> 01:25:46.740]  What I saw someone asked earlier, what's an average yield on a seven gallon pot of
[01:25:46.740 --> 01:25:47.740]  the Bobbies?
[01:25:50.420 --> 01:25:55.260]  I would say single and that's hard to call because I multiply and that's I would be
[01:25:55.260 --> 01:25:56.420]  giving out false numbers.
[01:25:56.420 --> 01:25:57.420]  I never run a single plant.
[01:25:57.860 --> 01:25:58.860]  Right.
[01:25:59.060 --> 01:26:01.420]  I never do a single plant for pot, like hardly ever.
[01:26:03.540 --> 01:26:05.140]  Very, very rarely do I do that.
[01:26:07.900 --> 01:26:13.100]  And to see better performance that way, to give you an idea, like Anvil on a farm
[01:26:13.100 --> 01:26:16.300]  and we were putting in 30 gallon pots, there would be anywhere between five to seven
[01:26:16.300 --> 01:26:19.460]  females. It was up to 32 to 34 grams per square foot.
[01:26:20.180 --> 01:26:21.180]  That's an indoor?
[01:26:21.180 --> 01:26:22.180]  That was an indoor.
[01:26:22.180 --> 01:26:23.180]  That was an outdoor.
[01:26:23.180 --> 01:26:24.180]  Greenhouse light assist.
[01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:30.180]  Proper? Proper light, like good temperature, like it was a good grow?
[01:26:32.180 --> 01:26:34.180]  I mean, that's the parameters.
[01:26:34.180 --> 01:26:38.180]  I'm not asking to talk shit, but just so we know what we're looking at.
[01:26:39.180 --> 01:26:42.180]  It was definitely mismanaged. I think they could have knocked it out of the park a
[01:26:42.180 --> 01:26:45.180]  little bit better initially, but it was a good thing.
[01:26:45.180 --> 01:26:47.700]  It was definitely mismanaged. I think they could have knocked it out of the park a
[01:26:47.700 --> 01:26:48.700]  little bit better.
[01:26:49.100 --> 01:26:52.180]  Initially, they ignored the fact of like, hey, listen, they're going to do fine
[01:26:52.180 --> 01:26:54.460]  outside up here and the amount of daylight hours we had.
[01:26:54.460 --> 01:26:58.020]  I mean, where I'm at, I get 15 hours and 59 minutes of daylight.
[01:26:58.060 --> 01:27:00.460]  It's pretty close. You know, that's 16 hours of daylight here.
[01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:03.700]  That's a really long stretch for autos up here in the summertime.
[01:27:05.020 --> 01:27:08.500]  But they were running them later in the season towards the end.
[01:27:09.100 --> 01:27:12.100]  And I was like, listen, you guys are only getting like 12 hours of really good
[01:27:12.100 --> 01:27:15.020]  daylight. You need to turn the lights up on these in the nighttime.
[01:27:15.020 --> 01:27:18.300]  And give them at least a minimum of give them at least 15 hours of light where
[01:27:18.300 --> 01:27:21.340]  they're getting some, you know, some high intense light these last few hours.
[01:27:21.980 --> 01:27:24.460]  And they finally listened. And then, you know, it turned around for him.
[01:27:24.460 --> 01:27:27.500]  But if they had been doing it from the beginning, I think they'd had a better
[01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:31.140]  thing. And I think if they would have controlled their temps better as well as a
[01:27:31.140 --> 01:27:32.140]  few other things.
[01:27:33.580 --> 01:27:34.580]  It could have been even better.
[01:27:36.540 --> 01:27:40.500]  So did you see that kind of just generally down the
[01:27:40.500 --> 01:27:42.740]  line when they start showing sex?
[01:27:43.460 --> 01:27:44.460]  I did not.
[01:27:45.740 --> 01:27:49.740]  So down the line, you'll see sex between 10 to 12 days.
[01:27:49.780 --> 01:27:53.380]  I catch it at that early with the jewelers loop because I'm watching constantly.
[01:27:54.660 --> 01:27:58.260]  But the earliest I've seen, it's 10 days under a jewelers loop and it's enough to
[01:27:58.260 --> 01:28:00.420]  catch under like I could see it with the eye.
[01:28:00.740 --> 01:28:03.500]  But you can get a real definition with the jewelers loop.
[01:28:03.940 --> 01:28:05.300]  I can know what to look for. I can see.
[01:28:05.740 --> 01:28:08.900]  I think I've trained my eye over the years on such as looking at such a small
[01:28:08.900 --> 01:28:13.180]  scale at the initial point to see those hairs
[01:28:13.220 --> 01:28:17.580]  stand out beside, you know, between what's forming a set of balls
[01:28:17.580 --> 01:28:20.980]  in between there. And that's what I was talking about earlier, too, about Bobby's.
[01:28:21.140 --> 01:28:25.580]  She'll sex roughly about this big, you know, eight inches or something like six
[01:28:25.580 --> 01:28:28.740]  inches, I think. And then you're like, I mean, where's the size coming from?
[01:28:28.740 --> 01:28:32.020]  And then once she sexes, it takes off like a bottle rocket.
[01:28:32.380 --> 01:28:36.300]  Like I need to put some high speed cameras on it just to watch the thing grow
[01:28:36.900 --> 01:28:39.580]  or not high speed. But what do you call it?
[01:28:39.580 --> 01:28:44.100]  Time lapse, because it puts on a scene of Mount of plant mass.
[01:28:45.140 --> 01:28:46.300]  Very in a very short window.
[01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:50.760]  Side branching, vertical growth.
[01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:55.200]  I'll go crazy within the time she's really starting to sex
[01:28:55.200 --> 01:28:57.840]  out. Once she figures out what she wants to be, she really gets going.
[01:29:04.010 --> 01:29:05.650]  All right. Thank you.
[01:29:05.690 --> 01:29:09.250]  So why don't why don't we
[01:29:09.610 --> 01:29:13.010]  hit the home stretch? Let me just I'm going to put you two on.
[01:29:13.010 --> 01:29:15.250]  You can talk shop for a minute.
[01:29:15.250 --> 01:29:17.530]  I just want to go put an eye on the kids.
[01:29:18.050 --> 01:29:19.170]  Oh, I completely get that.
[01:29:20.130 --> 01:29:21.130]  So I'll be right back.
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:27.840]  Sorry, but the coffin and the mic.
[01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:29.480]  No, you're good.
[01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:33.640]  So, yeah, Bobby's Widow's coming back out for you.
[01:29:34.040 --> 01:29:35.920]  ABC, obviously the Australian Ambassador.
[01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:39.120]  Can this is something new for people to grab a hold of?
[01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:41.520]  I mean, as soon as we're still here, I mean, if there's any kind of questions
[01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:43.480]  while we're waiting on Peter, you know, it's sad that people got some more
[01:29:43.480 --> 01:29:44.880]  questions. I don't know if you can see it, Josh.
[01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:47.280]  Can you still be? Yeah, I can see the feed.
[01:29:47.720 --> 01:29:50.760]  Yeah. So, you know, if they've got questions out there, I mean, we can do a
[01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:54.440]  little bit of a Q&A if that's what you want to do, unless you've got more
[01:29:54.440 --> 01:29:56.480]  specific questions or things you want to talk about, sir.
[01:29:59.860 --> 01:30:02.380]  Let's scroll up to see what I can see.
[01:30:03.180 --> 01:30:05.700]  Someone's saying you're convincing him to go to multipart.
[01:30:07.740 --> 01:30:10.300]  I think it's a it's a I think it's a good thing to do.
[01:30:10.300 --> 01:30:12.260]  And if you're going to do it, you know, let's put some caveats in.
[01:30:12.300 --> 01:30:15.060]  That's that's, you know, reinforce that information.
[01:30:15.060 --> 01:30:18.980]  The multipart thing, if you're going to do it, if you typically grew an auto one
[01:30:18.980 --> 01:30:22.940]  plant in a three gallon, if you want a multipart, I would dump yourself up.
[01:30:22.940 --> 01:30:26.180]  If you're going to go go up to a five gallon, drop three plants, three seeds in
[01:30:26.180 --> 01:30:30.460]  there. If you're using regulars, if you're using feminized, go with two.
[01:30:31.740 --> 01:30:35.580]  I personally have put ten and a ten gallon pot.
[01:30:35.780 --> 01:30:40.540]  Now, mind you, I would remove males as they would show up and then train them out
[01:30:40.540 --> 01:30:43.260]  to the outside. And I mean, they do extremely well in there.
[01:30:44.260 --> 01:30:49.220]  You know, it's a living soil, so it's in cloth pots and there's root pruning going
[01:30:49.220 --> 01:30:51.860]  on. I never really see any kind of competition.
[01:30:51.860 --> 01:30:53.660]  You know, early on, you may see, you know.
[01:30:55.180 --> 01:30:58.420]  Pheno tip, you know, you see a Pheno difference, but you really don't see a food
[01:30:58.420 --> 01:31:00.460]  demand difference. I don't see him fighting for that food in there.
[01:31:00.460 --> 01:31:05.060]  So just remember, if you're going to multipart, make sure that you compensate for
[01:31:05.060 --> 01:31:06.300]  the amount of plants you're putting in.
[01:31:06.300 --> 01:31:10.300]  I know we were talking earlier. We would put ten to 15 and a 30 gallon callback.
[01:31:10.620 --> 01:31:12.660]  So, you know, keep your mind on that.
[01:31:12.660 --> 01:31:14.140]  I mean, I experiment and play.
[01:31:14.140 --> 01:31:18.500]  It doesn't hurt my feelings any to lose a couple of plants or make a huge mistake.
[01:31:19.140 --> 01:31:22.220]  But I would just hate for somebody to try it for the first time and then get
[01:31:22.220 --> 01:31:24.180]  overcrowded. And it just turns out bad for me.
[01:31:24.220 --> 01:31:25.620]  Just be cautious on how you approach it.
[01:31:26.100 --> 01:31:27.260]  You know, baby steps.
[01:31:28.180 --> 01:31:31.460]  Yeah, so all these seeds are available right now on the Doggos site.
[01:31:32.660 --> 01:31:34.660]  Hop on there and get them.
[01:31:34.980 --> 01:31:37.260]  There's a limited availability.
[01:31:37.740 --> 01:31:39.260]  We have the ABC, the.
[01:31:40.700 --> 01:31:43.140]  The gem and the Bobby's widow.
[01:31:43.700 --> 01:31:46.980]  And and then they'll be on there for a couple of weeks and then they'll be
[01:31:46.980 --> 01:31:51.820]  available. I stock everything on my site on the regenerative Cico.
[01:31:52.340 --> 01:31:54.100]  And we have videos there and stuff.
[01:31:54.100 --> 01:31:56.740]  So you can look at more stuff and at length of me and him.
[01:31:57.820 --> 01:31:59.700]  Get high and talk about that.
[01:32:02.700 --> 01:32:06.220]  Yeah, and I think you answered the question or they've asked a few times, will
[01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:08.180]  your autos handle 100 degree temps?
[01:32:09.340 --> 01:32:13.900]  Yes, I've seen I've got some friends that grow down in Southern California, a
[01:32:13.900 --> 01:32:19.140]  real close friend of mine has had him out and, you know, it gets pretty hot where
[01:32:19.140 --> 01:32:22.900]  he's at, actually way up into the hundreds and hammer through.
[01:32:23.780 --> 01:32:26.900]  I've seen him do well in greenhouses that were mismanaged, which we were speaking
[01:32:26.900 --> 01:32:31.060]  about before. And they really don't bat an eye at it.
[01:32:31.420 --> 01:32:35.140]  But the most things that you will see is foxtail at the end of flowers.
[01:32:35.140 --> 01:32:38.260]  The bud formations are pretty good, but it starts putting out weird foxtails
[01:32:38.260 --> 01:32:40.180]  because the temperature is 115 degrees.
[01:32:40.180 --> 01:32:42.380]  Like you're sending the plant way beyond its stress curve.
[01:32:42.380 --> 01:32:48.530]  Definitely back.
[01:32:48.930 --> 01:32:52.690]  He's back and he's back with my coffee.
[01:32:55.010 --> 01:32:57.290]  Someone asked about CMH.
[01:32:59.770 --> 01:33:01.290]  CMH is another good I like them.
[01:33:02.370 --> 01:33:03.810]  I like to see that they produce.
[01:33:03.850 --> 01:33:05.170]  Have you used them with your autos?
[01:33:06.050 --> 01:33:10.690]  Yes, I've used them and then one of the largest deep water culture growth I've seen
[01:33:10.690 --> 01:33:14.130]  of the ALF number five was in a 20.
[01:33:14.210 --> 01:33:16.170]  What are the what are the industry standard?
[01:33:17.650 --> 01:33:21.290]  Black and gold, black and yellow boxes, what are they, 28 gallons, Josh, like, you
[01:33:21.290 --> 01:33:25.850]  know, when everybody transports their flower in, he made that into a deep water
[01:33:25.850 --> 01:33:29.330]  culture. And I mean, the guy pulled a pound under a ceramic metal halide plant with
[01:33:29.330 --> 01:33:35.130]  it. And there's pictures on autoflower.net still under all my test threads.
[01:33:35.130 --> 01:33:38.370]  I mean, if you go to autoflower.net and you go into the.
[01:33:39.370 --> 01:33:44.010]  Seas and breeders section, the Mandalorian genetics are there, I pulled all of my
[01:33:44.010 --> 01:33:48.490]  information from over the years on the site into one central location on there, that
[01:33:48.490 --> 01:33:53.050]  way people have the ability to go in and check it out and say, hey, this is what I
[01:33:53.050 --> 01:33:54.810]  thought. This is what I'm looking at.
[01:33:54.810 --> 01:33:56.810]  And then you can see the historical information, too.
[01:33:56.970 --> 01:33:58.130]  Like this is where they came from.
[01:33:58.530 --> 01:33:59.610]  This is how it got worked.
[01:34:00.370 --> 01:34:04.130]  So a lot of generalistic questions would probably be answered there.
[01:34:04.130 --> 01:34:08.210]  But most of time they can either message me, private message me on there when I get
[01:34:08.210 --> 01:34:10.530]  around to check them or hit me on DM.
[01:34:14.210 --> 01:34:20.170]  Quickly, do you want to, you know, besides us doing the Femme Bobby's Winnow line,
[01:34:20.170 --> 01:34:22.610]  what are you what's what's on the forefront for you?
[01:34:22.610 --> 01:34:24.530]  What are you working with? I know we've talked about it.
[01:34:25.690 --> 01:34:30.370]  Yeah, so I've been debating whether or not and to share it and when to share it.
[01:34:31.370 --> 01:34:33.890]  I am going to attempt to feminize Anvil this winter.
[01:34:34.130 --> 01:34:38.450]  I have had a huge ask for that.
[01:34:39.010 --> 01:34:44.530]  A lot of people have wanted feminized Anvil because of plant counts in new states, plant
[01:34:44.530 --> 01:34:45.890]  counts in other states where they can't.
[01:34:46.170 --> 01:34:50.970]  They don't have the luxury that I do with, you know, holding that medical card in a
[01:34:50.970 --> 01:34:52.810]  certain amount that I get.
[01:34:53.450 --> 01:34:56.810]  And I want to get I like to answer the people.
[01:34:57.410 --> 01:34:59.810]  One of the things was everybody asked me to get Bobby's Widow out.
[01:34:59.970 --> 01:35:03.770]  I got it out. And then a lot of people are asking for feminized.
[01:35:03.770 --> 01:35:07.330]  And I think she's now at the point where I would feel comfortable, comfortable
[01:35:07.330 --> 01:35:11.330]  feminizing it. And people are not getting a bunch of crazy phenotypical expression
[01:35:11.330 --> 01:35:15.410]  results on the other side. I think the first round may show some funkiness, but I think
[01:35:15.410 --> 01:35:20.250]  it'll be a big benefit to myself, commercial farms as well as the home grower who want
[01:35:20.250 --> 01:35:22.090]  to grow some heavily sedative purple weed.
[01:35:27.260 --> 01:35:29.500]  And that that was the other thing we were talking about earlier, too, about the
[01:35:29.500 --> 01:35:30.820]  timeframe and the plant count.
[01:35:30.820 --> 01:35:34.300]  And it's like I didn't really finish out the thought, whereas I appreciate your
[01:35:34.820 --> 01:35:39.020]  patience. You know, stuff goes through made a batch of seed for the anvil and the
[01:35:39.020 --> 01:35:44.820]  alpha spring or late winter for the spring run and spring buy ups and midsummer.
[01:35:44.820 --> 01:35:46.700]  They were gone. And this.
[01:35:48.820 --> 01:35:52.820]  But that's just with having a certain plant count, I can't be running like I've got an
[01:35:52.820 --> 01:35:57.140]  outdoor crop and I grow for my medical needs that way I can maintain my flower
[01:35:57.900 --> 01:36:00.700]  through the season of the wintertime when I breathe.
[01:36:00.780 --> 01:36:05.660]  So I have to shut down my indoor grow operation because it's climate controlled to
[01:36:05.660 --> 01:36:07.100]  properly dry out my medication.
[01:36:07.100 --> 01:36:09.340]  So there are there's going to be lag between this.
[01:36:09.340 --> 01:36:12.740]  And I just appreciate people's patience who've been waiting patiently.
[01:36:12.820 --> 01:36:14.660]  And I don't want anybody to feel that they've missed out.
[01:36:14.700 --> 01:36:18.620]  I haven't forgot about you. I'm just working on it, you know, constantly staying on the
[01:36:18.620 --> 01:36:19.620]  ground.
[01:36:19.860 --> 01:36:23.660]  Here's a general cultivation question.
[01:36:25.140 --> 01:36:28.580]  Related to others, I don't think nutrients trigger it.
[01:36:28.580 --> 01:36:33.420]  What I have seen, though, in regular seed is high, high amounts of nitrogen,
[01:36:33.420 --> 01:36:35.740]  specifically salt fed autos.
[01:36:36.740 --> 01:36:38.180]  So higher male ratio.
[01:36:38.860 --> 01:36:43.180]  Now, I don't know if that is just happenstance, but I've seen it more than once.
[01:36:44.340 --> 01:36:45.740]  But I don't see that.
[01:36:48.180 --> 01:36:50.740]  It's not triggering their flower cycle whatsoever.
[01:36:51.780 --> 01:36:55.820]  We still there's a huge debate out there on what still caused that auto cycle and.
[01:36:56.820 --> 01:37:01.700]  I don't that's a that's a dark rabbit hole that we can get out of the conversation.
[01:37:02.940 --> 01:37:05.900]  But now to answer the question in general, I don't think your nutrient line is going to
[01:37:05.900 --> 01:37:08.060]  cause the trigger. The plant's going to do it itself.
[01:37:09.060 --> 01:37:11.740]  Some people say maturity, other people say root depth.
[01:37:12.980 --> 01:37:13.860]  Still to be determined.
[01:37:24.220 --> 01:37:29.500]  All right, well, do you guys want to wrap it up for now, because we got I got to go.
[01:37:29.740 --> 01:37:34.060]  I got James loud at 11, which is.
[01:37:35.860 --> 01:37:37.740]  This one. Whoops.
[01:37:38.980 --> 01:37:41.420]  So that's in 20 minutes.
[01:37:42.140 --> 01:37:44.220]  Well, yeah, I'd not be good with me.
[01:37:44.300 --> 01:37:48.100]  I mean, I Peter, I think if you're tired today, I really, really do.
[01:37:48.140 --> 01:37:49.580]  Thanks for having me on. Huge honor.
[01:37:50.260 --> 01:37:53.100]  Josh, you know, thank you for making this connection and making this happen.
[01:37:53.100 --> 01:37:54.420]  And thank you for the help up there.
[01:37:55.780 --> 01:37:58.620]  You know, I appreciate you guys this time and having somebody like myself just go on
[01:37:58.620 --> 01:38:02.940]  and shoot to ship with and try to educate, you know, it's it's nice to be around
[01:38:02.940 --> 01:38:06.660]  like minded people. And it seems like we all have little kids and I'm like yourself.
[01:38:06.660 --> 01:38:11.020]  I don't have another show, but I got a very highly energetic little guy that mom
[01:38:11.020 --> 01:38:12.740]  probably needs some kind of reprieve from right now.
[01:38:13.140 --> 01:38:15.900]  Yeah, no, I appreciate it.
[01:38:15.940 --> 01:38:20.380]  Now. And everybody appreciates when someone like yourself who's put it.
[01:38:20.420 --> 01:38:21.980]  I mean, someone said it earlier.
[01:38:22.380 --> 01:38:26.740]  If I can quickly find it, where was.
[01:38:28.140 --> 01:38:32.260]  Unless it's just way up in the comments, but yeah, someone just appreciating like how
[01:38:32.260 --> 01:38:37.860]  much, you know, you how much work you put into what you're doing and,
[01:38:38.860 --> 01:38:42.500]  you know, then listening to you talk about it and kind of your intent.
[01:38:43.540 --> 01:38:46.020]  So, well, and I appreciate that.
[01:38:46.020 --> 01:38:48.460]  It's it's a I think it's a passion for me.
[01:38:48.980 --> 01:38:50.380]  It's just something that's been.
[01:38:52.860 --> 01:38:57.260]  You know, it's been a driving force for me for a long time for many several reasons.
[01:38:59.660 --> 01:39:02.780]  You know, one of the thing I'll throw out there, too, is, you know, I've got my name
[01:39:02.780 --> 01:39:03.780]  up here as Dan.
[01:39:04.100 --> 01:39:05.340]  I'm a step ahead of you.
[01:39:06.220 --> 01:39:08.980]  Nice. I'm on here as Dan.
[01:39:08.980 --> 01:39:14.620]  I should have put on. You can find me at full duplex underscore AFN on Instagram.
[01:39:15.500 --> 01:39:16.900]  Yeah, that one's too right.
[01:39:17.380 --> 01:39:18.660]  You have the Mandalorian next.
[01:39:18.660 --> 01:39:20.660]  You can find me there with that one as well.
[01:39:21.620 --> 01:39:25.620]  Either way, if you hit the full duplex when you are going to DM me directly, the
[01:39:25.620 --> 01:39:28.500]  Mandalorian genetics is run by actually my cousin.
[01:39:28.980 --> 01:39:33.220]  He's a business manager and helps me procure my sales and helps me fill that
[01:39:33.220 --> 01:39:35.980]  account to once he got to the point where it took off.
[01:39:37.100 --> 01:39:39.900]  It was a huge it was huge help to have him, you know, feel that for me.
[01:39:39.900 --> 01:39:42.140]  So, yeah, I'm a big fan of his.
[01:39:42.140 --> 01:39:44.260]  It was huge help to have him, you know, feel that for me.
[01:39:44.260 --> 01:39:48.300]  So if you do reach out on that side, it takes a day or two is because he's getting
[01:39:48.300 --> 01:39:49.300]  that to me.
[01:39:49.740 --> 01:39:52.420]  So, you know, I like to be transparent with the people and I want to thank him for all
[01:39:52.420 --> 01:39:53.420]  that help.
[01:39:57.520 --> 01:39:58.520]  All right.
[01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:00.880]  What did Sunnyland say?
[01:40:00.920 --> 01:40:01.920]  Hold on.
[01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:04.720]  Why don't we end with that?
[01:40:06.520 --> 01:40:07.640]  So that work for you?
[01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:09.160]  Does that work for you?
[01:40:09.400 --> 01:40:10.480]  Josh, do you have any.
[01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:11.880]  Do you disagree?
[01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:14.240]  Agreed. OK.
[01:40:15.080 --> 01:40:16.080]  All right.
[01:40:19.640 --> 01:40:21.360]  Well, thank you, everyone.
[01:40:21.400 --> 01:40:24.760]  And Dan, we all appreciate your time.
[01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:29.840]  And so actually, this goes for both of you, too.
[01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:35.400]  Tuesday night, we're doing the fundraiser for
[01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:38.840]  fire relief. We're finally getting some of that stuff off the ground.
[01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:43.520]  So if either of you I mean, hopefully we'll do it weekly or at least
[01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:48.360]  regularly. So if either of you guys want to jump on, offer anything
[01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:53.040]  up. I know various people have sent packs to
[01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:54.120]  Adam.
[01:40:55.400 --> 01:40:59.640]  Yeah, I agree with Spotcheck News that 260 people need to hit the like button.
[01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:07.840]  So anyway, and some people reached out to me about helping out.
[01:41:07.880 --> 01:41:09.240]  So, yeah, anybody who wants to help.
[01:41:09.720 --> 01:41:14.400]  Like someone like you guys who could emcee, you know,
[01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:19.160]  an auction, other people who could help out on the administrative side, just
[01:41:19.160 --> 01:41:23.560]  dealing with the back office shit, because the less back office
[01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:28.000]  shit we need to deal with, the more we can just be live broadcasting and
[01:41:28.760 --> 01:41:29.760]  raising money.
[01:41:31.480 --> 01:41:35.720]  But Adam, who is camera shy,
[01:41:36.200 --> 01:41:38.200]  is going to come on on Tuesday night.
[01:41:39.080 --> 01:41:42.600]  But yeah, if other people want to help out in any way, just let us know.
[01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:46.880]  And in 15 minutes, we got James
[01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:50.280]  loud. Then I get to play with my kids for the rest of the day.
[01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:52.600]  You guys should go do the same.
[01:41:52.960 --> 01:41:55.040]  And everybody else with kids, go play with them.
[01:41:55.760 --> 01:41:59.120]  Right on. Or go play with them in two hours after James's show.
[01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:03.360]  All right. Thanks, everyone.
[01:42:03.920 --> 01:42:04.920]  Thank you very much.
[01:42:05.160 --> 01:42:06.480]  Bye. Bye.
