Good morning everyone, we are live from Node Labs global slash world headquarters with
James Loud on the road.
Take it away James.
Hey guys, how you doing?
Thanks for viewing this week, I really appreciate you guys.
Today we have Chris from Compound right here and we have Dan, the CEO of Node Labs.
Thank you guys for joining me today.
Thanks for having us man.
Awesome, yeah this is my first mobile show.
So Chris, tell me a little bit about yourself and how you got started with cannabis.
I know you're from Portland, at least Todd Vowell is from Portland.
Yeah, started cannabis during age, I've been passionate about it my whole life.
Started growing it when I was a freshman in high school, I was passionate about that for
a long time.
Moved to Amsterdam in 2004, 2006, grew there, studied some industry there for a while.
I came back to the States in 2006 and started growing in the houses medical community there.
Started medical, started growing there for about 6 years, 8 years.
So I recently started in Oregon, medical, and I started working with the sensory thing.
I worked at one of the main ones in Portland, I became their head grower and elevated my
position experience and I graduated to genetics from there.
Awesome, so what kind of strains did you grow back in the day in Amsterdam?
The first strain I ever grew was Shishkabir, a strain called Dogshift.
Some of the others were Cough and Dogshift also.
Dogshift is totally from Portland, that's like the classic Portland strain.
Yeah, I think a lot of people don't even know about it and it's got a real funk to it.
Awesome, so with Amsterdam, were you hanging out with Soma?
Yeah, Soma was a really good guy, he loves smoking weed.
He's a good guy, he loves smoking weed.
He's a family guy, he was on the show a couple episodes ago, he's just a really genuine guy
and he's a character for sure.
He's got more cats than he does animals.
He loves breeding cats.
Very unique character.
Totally.
So with the Portland scene, you guys started pretty early on with legalization of the area.
That was like the first business in the country.
Yeah, it was in 2004.
Yeah, so that was like the medical side of it.
Yeah, that's awesome.
So how was that transition going from medical to that?
It was good, the medical was a lot better.
Well, and then the price dropped out sometime around that time.
Yeah, it's pretty crazy how that changes things, especially with the black market.
And then the price fluctuates so much with the black market, it's really weird.
All this stuff, you know, traditional.
Hey, James, just quickly, I'm going to text you the link.
Use your phone with no video.
And that'll be your audio source.
And maybe just put that phone on like a sweatshirt or something, so every time you guys slap the table it doesn't make a noise.
But let me, I'll text you...
Oh wait, hold on, give me one second.
I think you did, I got it right here.
And then I'll mute the computer audio.
There we go.
And then we'll just do that audio.
Whoa.
Okay, so now you can even do audio only with the phone.
Okay, so we can kill the camera.
There you go, look at that.
How's that sound? A lot better?
Oh my god.
It's like we're in a broadcast studio.
Amazing.
It's like I'm Clem Fandango behind the curtain.
Nice.
So yeah, so I guess we were talking about Portland and dog shit.
I mean, I think it's another one of those strains, it's like cat piss that isn't really appealing to everybody.
But like if you like it, you love it.
Yeah, it's a great profile.
There's a bunch of good strains from Oregon that I think the world hasn't had a chance to experience.
Like Trinity, the four-way, we had the corn and the snow all came from the Eugene area.
Those were some of my favorites back in the day.
That's where we got our Chem 91, which was actually called New York City Diesel back in the day.
And then we got the West Coast Dog, which was another one that's like, I believe it's a bag seed.
It grows almost identical to the sour diesel, but it has like a flat rather than a conical top to it.
It's a multi-composition, I guess.
Yeah, lots of unique flavors.
There's this guy Eugene Bob, he builds cars, like these Resto Mod, like crazy cars.
He puts weed leaves and all kinds of stuff all over them.
But yeah, he's the guy with the Trinity.
Is he out there right now?
I'm not sure where he's at right now, but he still has the Trinity over there for sure.
Like the real Trinity.
Yeah, if you ever want the real Trinity, just let me know.
We can get that from Bob for sure.
So yeah, Bob, if you're watching, we're coming for that Trinity.
So with REC going, how did Compound get started?
I was originally doing it under Territory's, Territory's is a French brand.
I had a series of events, and what we're seeing now is a creative brand that's more of a mainstream,
particularly to a broader audience, so we compounded.
At the time, I was on the platform, and that's when all the injectable gelato came on the market.
I had to take part in those events, I knew they were very hot, so I started with Super Compound.
I also went to Chalice in 2017, which I'm about to find you there.
I met up with a guy, a capillary from a person there, and a capillary gave me the seed, a trade seed capillary,
and he gave me the seed for the LLAF2.
I had to listen to him about that, so we all kind of came about at the same time.
Wow. So Compound's been around since 2015, 16?
17, 18.
18, wow. Yeah, you've come a long ways in a short amount of time.
It's pretty impressive, and then you've really focused on Terps.
Yeah, Terps is all I've done.
It's all Terps, like all your genetics have heavy Terps.
It's mostly Terps that we can't create.
Yeah, totally.
So, I guess, moving on down to California, that happened more recently.
How did that all happen?
I was interested in pursuing tissue culture.
I was at Indorex with NorCal, and I met Tissue Labs.
A good friend of mine helped, he was an advisor for me, helped navigate me through a lot of issues I had at the time.
He introduced me to Dan from Node Labs.
Nice.
I worked with Dan for a good couple of months, came to S&M a couple of times to sort of do a little internship.
It became clear to me that there's more opportunities in California for Compound.
Yeah.
The higher level site, maybe even here.
Awesome.
So, Dan, tell us a little bit about Node.
Being the CEO, how long have you been with Node?
Did you start from the ground up?
Yeah, yeah. I was one of the two founders of Node.
And now, just quickly slide that one mic.
Yeah, there we go.
Like James on mic duty.
Yeah.
So, I started Node late 2017, early 2018.
I was director of operations for the Chalice Festival in 2017.
Oh, wow.
So, I got to be behind the scenes and placing booths.
I know Dougie really well.
Yeah, man.
I've known Dougie for a long time.
Him and Mila and I, we did the first Dabadoo in San Francisco was like Dougie, myself, and Nikiti.
No shit.
That's a long, long time ago.
Yeah, man.
It's small circles, for sure.
So, that was a blast.
And, you know, I was kind of looking for what to do next.
My business partner, Chris Lovett, was doing tissue culture for the state of California for endangered species.
Oh, wow.
And said, man, there's got to be an application for cannabis.
Like, not exactly sure what it is.
Can you help me, like, navigate the waters and see what opportunities there might be?
So, when I was at the Chalice Festival, you know, occasionally I'd ask people, hey, what's the value of your genetics?
Have you ever lost a strain?
And some people said, nah, like, I'm good.
Like, we never, my plants never get sick.
100% no problems.
And other people said, dude, it's a major problem.
If you can help keep one of my strains around forever, like, that would be fucking phenomenal.
So, late 2017, I moved out here during the fires in Sonoma County.
2018, we really got it going.
May is when the lab opened.
And we spent a lot of time doing R&D.
The first year was just figuring out the process.
There really isn't a textbook on how to do tissue culture for cannabis.
And a lot of the papers and a lot of the information that's out there is really bad.
It's just not, like, it's not repeatable.
So, we spent a lot of time doing R&D, figured out a couple things that made it really work.
And it's been growing quite a bit since then.
And when an opportunity came to work with Chris, you know, a breeder with a massive collection,
like, really just lightning out of a bottle, it was a no-brainer.
We should figure out a way to work together to, you know, back up the genetics and bring them into, bring them to market here in California.
Awesome. Good stuff.
Yeah, it's funny.
With tissue culture, I feel like there's no two companies that do it exactly the same.
Everyone has their angle and everyone has, there's some, well, tissue culture is such a broad thing, too.
Yes, absolutely.
It's a, covers a really large, different set of tools that are under the tissue culture umbrella.
We've really focused on cleaning people's genetics up and preserving them long-term.
So, you're being on the banking and...
Correct.
We have a really big library.
It's north of 300 different genetics.
Some of that we offer as clones.
Some of it is private.
You know, we have a lot of connected and alien labs collection, maybe 40 varieties.
And that's private to them.
We don't even know what we're handling.
It's all in code.
But it's a lot of fun to be able to go into this space that's, you know, very, very modest and have a ridiculous collection of genetics.
And be able to draw from them whenever we want.
And, you know, working with Chris, it's been remarkable to see stuff start in the lab and then get blown up out in the world in California and other places around the country.
It's pretty phenomenal.
Awesome.
Yeah, really good stuff.
So, you guys do sell tissue culture starts.
You do sell clones.
We do sell...
Like from tissue culture moms.
Correct.
Yeah, we focused on clones from tissue culture moms so that we can switch up varieties pretty regularly.
Awesome.
We have a new menu every season.
So, a fall menu, a winter menu, a spring menu.
We also deliver clean stock to nursery partners so that they can ramp up production and, you know, we can reach more people with our clean stock.
Some of the other guys have focused on micro propagation.
And for us, that's a rabbit hole that we're going to let other people explore for a bit.
We really want to be able to hold a large variety of genetics, bring them out into market when we want.
And, you know, there are opportunities for more advanced things in tissue culture in the breeding side of things that we are working on with Chris, which is great.
So, it's not just preserving people's private genetics, but we're also helping to create some of the next generation of genetics.
Awesome.
What's your favorite new variety?
Oh, man.
This Joker's that we just pulled down is pretty wild.
Huge fan of that one.
There's some new stuff coming around the corner too that we're in the process of hunting too that I'm really excited about.
It's really hard to say, man.
I'm from the East Coast originally, so I'm still like looking for a couple of those East Coast strains we haven't been able to find.
We had this sour back in the day that just fetched the most ridiculous price.
And technically it was a sage and sour diesel, but it was the loudest sour I've come across.
We got sage and sour for sure.
Oh, man.
This was like a...
Yeah.
Well, so it was like real quadruly and really...
It was also really small.
Like the units were like this big when we got them on the East Coast, but they fetched the highest prices.
They all came from out here, I'm sure.
Oh, yeah.
I mean...
Oh, well, I assume.
It came from somewhere.
Definitely.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It was like a really strong sour diesel-y.
It's like you had a gram in your jacket and the whole restaurant was blowing up.
Yeah.
Like there was no hiding.
Do you have weed on you?
You couldn't keep it anywhere.
Yeah, a lot of people think HPLV, hoplate and viroid had a lot to do with the demise of the sour diesel.
You know, Mojave Richmond and I did a show on the sour diesel and the origins.
But yeah, I mean the real sour is still out there.
There's some interesting types of sour out there now that it's been bred and back-crossed and stuff.
But like that, there's only one real sour.
Sure.
As far as I know, there's only one real sour diesel.
The East Coast sour diesel.
And you know, there's people that say other things, but to my knowledge, I've only seen one.
And it's one of those unmistakable varieties.
Yeah, man.
I was very fortunate to have good access.
Went to college in Amherst, so we had a lot of the chems, had the sours.
There were some people who made really beautiful products, but coming out here to the West Coast,
you know, a lot of the stuff you guys were just talking about, I haven't touched before.
So look forward to it.
Yeah.
Well, sour diesel is a good breeder.
I wouldn't be here today without sour.
Like that's what started Loud Seeds, was sour diesel across.
Perfect.
Yeah.
So let's talk about compound genetics and, you know, kind of what, I guess you guys met,
you got working together and then now you guys phenohunt together.
Sounds like a lot of people think that breeding, a lot of people think that breeding is just making seeds,
but like that's such a small part of making good genetics.
You know, I think anybody can make seeds, but being a good breeder, it requires phenohunting,
especially if you're breeding original varieties and you have your own donor.
And I think breeding feminized, you have advantages, but talk a little bit about your, you know,
like how you breed, your methods, what you look for when you're doing selections.
Turps are key for me. Turps in structure and vigor, trying to use unique varieties of our specific compound.
I'm really proud of myself for having 10 edge flavors that are ahead of the curve,
using cultivars that are unique in their specific compound.
Yeah.
I think that's very important to us in selecting our traits and our designs for the market.
Nice.
Finding cultivars that are unique and are unforgettable turps.
I look for flavors that you can't forget, things that are going to stick in your palate and your profile for a long time.
So those are the main things for me.
Just creating new ways of going my own way.
I'm not really interested in following the trends of the market.
I want to like create my own trends.
Yeah.
And create flavors that are true to their name.
Flavors that are true to their name.
I really like the authentic of that.
It's important for me to create our own way and our own direction.
The compound is the best.
The best is the one that we do our own thing.
We create our own path.
Right.
It's awesome.
Yeah, I feel like you have some interesting stuff.
Like the apples and bananas.
You showed me some apples.
Chris gave me some apples and bananas maybe three weeks ago.
And it's like really stuck in my mind for the last three weeks.
I recognize the terps.
The main terp being that combination is something that I got in maybe 2013 from Y Life.
Oh, right.
Yeah, so Y Life and apples and bananas I think have very similar.
It's almost like Y Life on steroids.
I feel like it's a high.
And so I started looking at stuff on the internet and kind of researching a little bit more.
And Y Life has cherry pie in it.
I thought cherry pie was from GDP.
So we're talking about GDP terps like septids, brine, etc.
What's in apples and bananas?
It's GDP by blue power by Javati.
It's the mixture of Javati with granulated granulated with the fruit of the blue keys.
Yeah, and that blue power is something amazing.
I feel like...
Yeah, it's from Sin City.
So yeah, blue power is like this amazing variety that by itself is cool.
It's good.
I've been doing this stuff and my friend Jason Midnight Rider crossed it with the Loudberry
and created the strongest herb I've ever smoked in my life.
It's from that blue power.
Loudberry is good and it's decently strong.
But with that blue power it creates something to where like...
You feel like you're dabbing but you're smoking a joint.
It gets you tight behind the eyes.
It's dabweed.
Yeah, it's dabweed.
It's amazing. It's something in that blue power.
I think there's only a handful of people that have been able to work with the actual cut of blue power.
There's blue power that's been around.
Maybe who's got bag seeds and stuff.
But you'll find it every once in a while.
But that apples and bananas is kind of...
I feel like you're pushing the limits with stuff.
Yeah, it's up there.
I think John from Dog House is growing apples and bananas.
It's a collaboration with Cookies, right?
Yeah, with Berner.
So they're pushing it all over.
Yeah, all the digitalized versions.
Yeah, 30% THC.
30% THC and 6% terpenes.
John's a great grower from Dog House.
If you guys ever have a chance to get some of the apples and bananas up there.
I guess he's growing it.
He grows some fire.
But those are great numbers.
6% terpenes is more than double of a lot of stuff that's out there.
It's really unique. Very loud.
Very loud.
It's got floral...
It's got a floral note to it that I really like.
But it's got the gas tobacco.
I think nowadays with breeders...
People go real linear with stuff.
And it's really important to layer your flavors.
And if you look at the best new genetics, I feel like they're all layered.
Yeah, for a hundred bucks.
Yeah, totally.
You gotta have gas.
Now you have to have color.
And fruit.
If you're missing one of them, it's like, it's not exotic anymore.
It's like a level down.
You gotta check those boxes all the way around.
Yeah, and I think that's what good breeders do.
And good breeders are good pheno hunters.
And now we have access to tools.
So you guys do...
Basically, how many seeds do you pop when you pop seeds?
Right now, probably...
300?
300 to 100.
And then you select the outliers.
Do you do testing on all those plants?
Yes.
You test for caterpillars and terpenes?
And hoplites as well.
I think hoplite is such a big deal.
And I think people are kind of brushing it under the rug because they're scared of it.
And unless you're working with a TC company, they can clean it up.
And there's actually maybe three companies in the United States that can clean it up.
That's it.
A lot of people will say they can clean it up.
But the only way you can clean it up is testing after you've tried to clean it up.
You put it through culture.
You try to clean it up.
And then you have to test it multiple times.
It's not just like one and done like other things.
A lot of times, you're like, oh, I'm gonna try it.
And then you have to test it multiple times.
It's not just like one and done like other things.
A lot of stuff you can test.
You can clean it.
You can test it.
You can get rid of it.
But hoplite is like this scary thing that can pop back up.
And we don't even know about seeds.
What's your take on hoplite?
Yeah, I mean, it's a bummer, man.
It's definitely a scary stuff.
Slide that mic back on the other.
There we go.
Hold on.
I think you muted it.
Yep.
You're back.
Yeah, it's scary stuff.
A lot of people will have their harvest ruined because of it.
It also doesn't show up in the entire plant.
It can show up in one branch.
So you can get into week five or six of flower and think you're all good.
And then all of a sudden, it just shits the bed.
And it can still produce a decent number of grams a square foot, even with a sick plant.
But the potency's gone.
The terpenes are gone.
You're gonna have several grades worse flower than you would with clean starts.
It's gonna be dry.
Yeah.
It's gonna be dry.
Yeah, it sucks.
Because you have a beautiful half of a plant.
And then another half of the plant is terrible.
And then you gotta work backwards and think,
Shit, okay, which scissors did I use?
Did I cut on this plant and then go and cut on other plants?
Did I just make this worse?
One of our big clients right now
has a massive hoplatin issue
traveling through their facility.
So they came to us in a pinch
saying,
We pretty much need to scrap everything and start all over again.
Do you guys have clean starts available?
Which is how we got them in the door.
So it's just,
there's still a lot that we have to learn about it.
It's still the early days of this stuff.
But we test a plant
in three different places
three times before we ship it out.
So it goes through nine different panels
in vitro.
Testing the plant in vitro
before we ship it out.
But it is, like you said,
maybe three people in the country
who can actually get rid of it.
And it is a very slow process.
It's twelve months of work
in the lab
and we wish we could make it go faster
but that's just the reality of the situation.
It's just very fine work.
Yeah, and you get a lot of breeders
that just love their variety
that they've had forever and they want to keep it around.
And then they wonder why it's so expensive
to get it clean.
And it's like, well, there's a lot to it.
It's not just straightforward.
And some plants
I think there's been plants
that have had real problems.
Absolutely. There's a couple varieties
that we've come across
that are notoriously bad performers.
And I wonder if it's just
because back in the day
the plant got hoplatin very early on
and so people have only grown a sick plant.
Skittles I would put in that category
where when we got it, it was a very, very sick plant.
And I know people think
it's not the most aggressive grower.
We recently got
a S1 Larry
that was having some major problems.
A cat piss from 96
that we recently got.
That these things are just so faded.
It's going to be a lot of work to bring it back.
Jnetics, by the way.
Oh yeah, the Shoreline.
So Shoreline is another one
that's a great topic because Shoreline is the closest
to the real roadkill skunk
I believe that I've ever seen.
The Shoreline
from Texas.
I like the Shoreline from Amsterdam which is crossed with lavender.
Which is good, but it's not skunk.
It's not strong skunk.
And then cat piss, you're working with Jnetics
with Jay
and he has the cat piss.
We have the cat piss cup coming up hopefully
this summer.
Well the thing is, cat piss is one of those varieties
where people down south
have a cat piss.
The San Diego from Tom,
he's the cat piss guy.
And then we've got the NorCal cat piss.
Adam Dunn and I were talking about getting everybody together
and
another guy from Amsterdam
getting everybody together
and having a cup over the weekend
and identifying what we think is the real cat piss.
Because what I think of
as the cat piss is different than what the guys down south.
So there's multiple cat pisses.
It's just a flavor profile
and there's nothing wrong with that.
We got that once
or twice on the East Coast.
I remember sitting in the back and being like
the name is so on point
I'll buy it, but fuck man this is unusual.
It's skunky.
Super super skunky
and ammonia
and growing up in the Bay Area
that's what got me into smoking exotic
and the best weed.
It was $60.08 straight up.
You could buy a pound for $60.08 straight up
and it had a terpene profile
that was unmistakable
and a tenth of a gram would smell your whole house up.
My parents would be like shaking their heads
like what is wrong with you
and it's like I don't have any weed.
But yeah interesting
and then so yeah
what's the strongest weed you've ever smoked?
That's a tough one.
Slide it all the way.
Dog walker from Bergen is pretty strong.
Yeah dog walker is pretty strong.
Yeah that's pretty strong.
Yeah hazes are a different kind of strong too.
Head high.
They're not popular here in the States.
They think like blue dream
or
yeah exactly.
Completely watered down.
Haze will give you heart full of potations.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Like Durban's you can smoke a good Durban
or a Malawi
or a red Congolese.
You guys know
Gold Seal and SF.
They got that red Congo.
In fact Marlon who's going to come on in a little bit
we smoked some on a show not too long ago
from Gold Seal
and all we did was laugh for about half an hour on the show.
I like the original Super Silver.
Yeah I like the
Super Silver back in the day
so we had one floating around SF
in like 97ish
97, 98
that was not like your typical haze.
It didn't have like the same
terp profile
as like that terpienoline, limonene
It had more of a funk
to it and it was super potent
and it was super
the structure was nice and it came out greasy.
Yes.
So yeah I'm a huge fan of Super Silver.
They're all great.
Totally.
Yeah all the original haze, Liberty Haze
A5
that's as close to Capis as I've seen
that's not Capis.
It has that ammonia-y
like that's a European from Neville
Yeah.
Tell us a little bit about your other strains
We got Baby Yoda in the works
Yeah, Pave, Fish Gale, Eye Candy
Lots of Super Silver 3s going out.
So Baby Yoda is
across
Cleofit Crescent by the Menthol
It's also called Cleofit Mince
Cool. So you've been working on that one for a while?
I did the polishing about
2 years ago but the selection came recently
I'm referring to my
pure pepper
and Burnt wanted it for the
Califa Cut project
so I got it for Cree Geese
Nice. Yeah that's a good cut
The Califa Cut from down there
is fire. It's awesome.
There's only a handful of people that know about it
or have worked with it but it's
I like it better than the Califa Cut that I've seen
So I think his
cut is better than the other stuff that I've seen
at Pure. What do you think that is actually?
I heard rumors it's a TK
Well I think it's a bag seed from
TK bag seed maybe or a SFE bag seed
I've heard
It's an OG bag seed that expresses
with more of color and like
I like the structure of it
and it's super sneaky
It's super potent
So yeah good stuff
Man and then so
Fish Scale. Let's talk about Fish Scale
We love the name Fish Scale
Mixed matter that one
It's another menthol cross
It's really gassy
It's got a strong chemical coverage
It's on one of the
menus that you can find at Pure
I like it a lot
What's the chirp on that?
It's more like creamy gas with
some skills rinsed in the background
Nice. Those Z-chirps
Yeah the Z-chirps
Z-chirps are super popular right now. It's pretty amazing
They never change. It's been a bit since
I don't think Z-chirps are going to go away
Just like Gelato is not going to go away
OG too
OG has lasted the test of time
It's like
Marlon for example
Marlon and I became friends from OG Kush
I've built relationships and friendships
on OG Kush and Gelato
When it first came out
I didn't see Gelato as being something
as big as it is
But it's really impressive how it's really kind of
dominating the market right now
And even in the breeding world
Everybody's working with something Gelato
and something Skittles
I feel like Sherbert didn't get his day
I love Sherbert
Sunset Sherbert
Rainbow Sherbert is another good one
RS11
That's a good one
They're crushing on that one
It's funny
because
when you get cannabis in the
regulated market, depending on who's growing it
You really have to have
good people growing your genetics
Consistently too
You want to be McDonald's consistency
with French Laundry quality genetics
That's a good point
If you can get that
consistency, it's so important
Because if somebody goes into a dispensary
and they buy something
and they're just a regular person
If it's not good, they're not going to buy that brand ever
I think a lot of brands
have fucked up in the California market
by jumping in too quickly
and not maintaining quality
Always king, always
Quality is king
Especially in California
Especially in California
Everybody calls themselves the epicenter
but I believe that
the Bay Area is the epicenter of cannabis
We are the Oakster Dam of the United States
There is amazing weed
everywhere else
Portland has super fire
You can get dispensaries
You can get super good shit
Washington
Seattle has good weed now
I think Seattle had a big problem
for the longest time
because Seattle is so damp
Just like Colorado is so dry
Seattle and Washington is so wet
So they have this humidity issue
All these guys now
They trim
It's all in a controlled environment
Some of them are
not even trimming until the orders need to go out
They're storing this stuff on the stem
with plant material around it
so then they trim it to order
They're getting fresh product out to the market
Every environment has their own unique
unique things that they have to do
to kind of
It's dry
Dude, Colorado
The weed used to be so dry
These guys have really kind of mastered that
too
What's your favorite state as far as cannabis?
Besides California?
Oregon
Yeah, me too
And then we got the East Coast
East Coast coming down
They got some good stuff
They're trying to make a mark
They've been in the game
especially around the Boston area
They've been crushing for a long time
New York
Chemdog
Totally
That Mastin
They've been into good weed for a long time
The Grateful Dead
I feel like a lot of good herb has revolved around the Grateful Dead
You go to Dead Shows back in the day?
Slide that mic back over
Too many fish shows
Too many fish shows to count
But the Dead, little
Just missed them by a little bit
I got into pot a little bit later in my life than other people
So, you know
Missed the boat on the Grateful Dead
Well, fish is kind of like an evolution of the Grateful Dead
Just like we're an evolution of the Grateful Dead
I feel like we are all like
coming from that same energy
We refocused it into cannabis
And I mean it's all about
We get these passionate people
on both sides that are passionate about
herb and a healthy mind
I feel like cannabis is so much more
For me it's medicine
It's something that's completely changed my life for the better
It's something that I think is healthy
It's not just a recreational drug
Yeah
So what are your thoughts on it?
I put that on the
weed stuff
I put it on the cannabis stuff
Very much in the debate
So what is your preferred method of smoking?
I'll admit I like the volcano a lot
Yeah
I like the joints too
But more of a vaporizer kind of volcano
I don't really like the blunt spot
I like smoky brews
Yeah, we smoked the bellow
That was a fun one
The drink your dab
Yeah, it's funny
The volcano has kind of stood the test of time too
It's been around for
God, it's been around at least since 2002
We used it so much
It melted
We all sat around it
All my friends grew
when I was younger
In the early 2000s
We used to go to each other's house and trim
We had a volcano
And then the In Living Color DVDs came out
So we'd watch that on repeat
And trim
I like good piped up
Yeah, totally
I love bubblers and pipes
I like good glass
Yeah
If it's good weed
You can smoke it anyway
But I like joints too
I like vaporizers
Because you get a different high
And you can smoke it
It looks smoky
But it's kind of like a proven volcano
Because you can see how robust the germs are
Do you use different bags for different strains?
Or do you just use the same bag?
Make sure
If you use one a lot
And then you use another one
You always get the detergent
But if you're smoking good weed
It all tastes good
Let's talk a little bit more about breeding
So you got jokers?
Yeah
Awesome
That's over here
That's the light one
That's my gypsum jaw
This is a 31'
Nice
It's really loud
It's really unique
It really leans towards that gelato
It's got that
Yeah
Yeah
Some white runs right here
Yeah, it's that earthy gelato
I love that earthy gelato
Because it's the same earth that you get in the OG's
And
This is the potty right here
Let's see if you guys can see that
Super fire
Super crisply
Good structure
Loud
The white runs is a nice cut
I like the white runs too
I think it's a good breeder
The original runs is good too
They got all these other ones now
Like black runs
I don't even know where they came from
It's so funny
But the white runs is unique
Pink runs is okay
Not my favorite
But the original runs is super good too
The white ones
Exactly
Mike made a whole bunch of runs crosses recently
And it obviously reverses really well
With the original
So yeah, and it breeds really well
I feel like you can get a lot of those chirps in there
And you get some interesting stuff besides that
Yeah
We had to go through a bunch of selections
Yeah
The Pave and the Joker's 31
Came from one of the original projects we did together
It was like north of a thousand seeds
It was like a 1200 seed phenome
Wow
That we selected from
Brought stuff in culture
Ran for additional testing
So both the Pave as well as the Joker's
You know
We're like a year plus into doing our homework on
Before we release
So a ton of time and energy
And obviously a very ambitious project to hunt through that stuff
But we've got more than a few winners
And it's definitely great to get to the other side of the testing
And have a good home for it
So are these grown in
Rockwool, is this Coco?
Rockwool
Yeah, Rockwool you can really
Push the chirps
Crop steering at least
As far as yields and balance
I used to not be a big fan of Rockwool
At all
But as far as for commercial scale
For repeated results
Especially when you're using other people's money
At scale
That's for sure
Yeah and I mean you get good growers
It's like
You know what to push through it
So yeah and these are all really really frosty
Really loud
You guys think Rockwool doesn't get loud
Do you get to smell this stuff?
Joker's my favorite one
Joker's got a lot of color
Yeah
Yeah
It's got lavender and earth
Which
You get lavender runs
Yeah and runs
Yeah
Totally
Yeah so as far as the industry
How do you guys see the industry going in the next
Three to five years
And then maybe ten years from now
Lots of changes, lots of innovations
Silicon, lots of expansion
The Delta grants are coming to market
Last time we
See if we can hold on
We need products to offer
And maintain the quality
Yeah
Can you move forward?
Totally and then other countries opening up
Yeah
There's some interesting
Projects that we're tackling in the next year
Obviously we're based here in California
But we now have
Tissue culture lab and facilities
Out in Michigan as well
Put in one in Florida this year as well
The project that I'm incredibly excited about
To bring it back home
Is we're building a tissue culture lab
And facility in the Netherlands
For the Dutch coffee shop experiment
Basically
All the weeds come through the back door
Historically for the coffee shops
They gave out ten licenses to produce
Weed for the coffee shops
And we are going to be doing that
So basically menu setting for coffee shops
Amsterdam is like
Wild, wild stuff
So it's going to be great to be able to tap into
Some of the genetics that they have over there
Some of the community
And for me it's like an incredible
Life experience that is way beyond
What I could have ever dreamed of
So it's going to be really interesting
To see as these other countries
And states open up
You know obviously
You know what I've seen
Is that the scene
Has moved from the Netherlands to the states
Where now obviously we produce the best cannabis
But the genetics are now here as well
I think the genetics
Used to be in Amsterdam
And now most of it is happening over here
So as the global cannabis market
Opens up it's going to be really interesting
To see some of the different
Genetics from all these different countries
Make their way into the fold
And you know probably get updated
And just a lot more exposure
For a lot of the stuff that stayed underground for so long
Yeah awesome
Are you working with a big company over there?
Like a big famous seed company?
Or are you guys working with
Do you want to talk about it?
Yeah no no happy to
We're working with a group that basically
Was brought in to help
Some people who got a license
You know there's only 10 licenses that were granted
And the guys who got it said hey
You know we're not experts in the field
Let's bring in a team of people who can help us make the best project possible
It's definitely an ambitious project
It's going to be producing probably around
14,000 pounds a year
So it's going to be a good size
But you know I'm thrilled about the team
That we're working with
The fact that they're saying hey what should we be doing
Let's make artisan hash
Let's grow the best cannabis
They're not looking to just grow a lot of weed
They don't want to become
Reflective of what you've seen a bit
In Canada
Where quality goes out the door
It's just about hitting the numbers
It's going to be exciting
There's going to be space for pheno hunting
And breeding and all these different bits and pieces
That go into making a really
Awesome company and project long term
Not just like hey let's grow a shit load
Of like one kind of weed
And call it a day
And see what we can get away with
Yeah it's not going to be mid city
Yeah it's funny because Amsterdam
There is good cannabis over there
Regardless of what people say
There's always been good cannabis over there
Totally there's shit that will really fuck you up
And even hash, hash is on a whole other level
People that have never been there
From here have no
Comprehension of the amount of hash
The type of varieties and the hash from all around the world
It's like an epicenter
The Moroccan hash
Yeah you don't see that stuff here
Lebanese, the different colors of Lebanese hash
That's what you see for that
Yeah
Totally
Amsterdam is a trip
Yeah it's a totally different
It's so funny because it's still illegal over there
They still have the coffee shops
They're still doing their thing
But they do have Tissue Culture over there
I know a couple companies
That are over there that are kind of starting
To or have been working with TC
Over the last couple years
You know the seed companies over there have made
A lot of money
You look at Sensi and Arian
Who was on the show a month ago
From Greenhouse
And some of these big companies
They've really pushed boundaries on a lot of stuff
A lot of genetics
Like for the skunk lines came from
California originally
But they also went out and found stuff
Everywhere around the world
From Afghanistan
I think we're kind of working on the shoulders
Of
Yeah
Feminized seeds
We both make feminized seeds
We wouldn't have been making feminized seeds
If it wasn't for people like
Dutch Passion and Greenhouse
And those guys over there
Yeah
Yeah
And it's like
Feminized seeds
Let's talk about feminized seeds versus regular seeds
What's your opinion on regular seeds and regular breeding
Do you do regular breeding as well
Yeah
Yeah
I think things are fine
People talk shit about them
But I think it's fine
Yeah
Lots of time
They're improving it
The advantage is you don't have to select males
It's easier to hunt
Yeah
It takes time to select good males
People don't get it
Selecting males takes a lot of time
It's a crap shoot
Feminized you know what the plant's going to do
Reverse it, terpene wise especially
Tricone production, stacking
I still love regular breeding
But
Yeah so as far as
Genetics
What's your thought on autoflowers
I haven't dealt with them much
They seem to be useful
For the industry
Yeah
Yeah yeah I love autoflowers
I think autoflowers are the future
I think obviously feminized seeds
I was scared of feminized seeds back 20 years ago
And then I was scared of autoflowers
I'm hesitant
I want to see proof
I'm more like the proof is in the pudding
Show me the proof
Guys have really been pushing the limits
Over the last
Maybe 6-7 years
With autos
Mephisto
Changed the game
My friend was growing some of their stuff
And breeding some of their stuff
I didn't believe him that it was autoflower
And the stuff that I saw
Over 10 years ago was garbage
I have no real experience with autoflowers
I'll bring you some autoflower
So you can smoke it
And grow really well
And push some terps
I didn't think you'd be able to push the terps
And the cannabinoids with autos like you can
I'm working with
A couple companies
We're in the high 20s
With cannabinoids for autoflower
And that kind of stuff is a game changer
Especially for biomass
If you can get high quality biomass
At scale
I think there's value to that
Full term is always going to have its place
I don't think autoflower
Is going to replace full term
And indoor
I think it's going to have its place
Just like feminized seeds have its place
No one wants to go
At scale you just can't do regular breeding
You can't throw a whole bunch of males
Unless you're trying to make seeds
You want to do some open pollination
I think we should do more effort in time
Ed Rosenthal would love to do that
Just take a whole bunch of regular seeds
And put it on an acre
Huge open population
Him and I were talking about that not so long ago
He's ready to just throw seeds out
Let them go
Get whatever you get
He's doing this million seed raise
He's trying to raise a million seeds
To donate to people
And to be able to give them out
He's super ambitious
He's a character
How do you see the industry moving forward
Over the next 2-5 years
We've come a long way
In 2-3 years already
The last 2-3
The small anecdote I can give
What I've seen on my end
When we first opened
It was difficult to source material
To do tissue culture on
Just to do R&D
We're now buying factories
And buying teams to do our homework
People wouldn't give us their genetics
For one reason or another
There's been a couple companies
That have made it difficult
For more science
Sciencey companies
To come into the space
But it's changed really quickly
We're super overbooked
With our cleaning work
People are rushing to give us their genetics
Because they see the application of tissue culture
I think there's going to be
A couple companies doing
Really interesting foundational work
I know the genetic testing space
Is still in its early days
Seeing how that gets integrated
Into breeding is going to be super interesting
In an ideal world for me
It looks like it does in wine
Where sure you can get 2-buck chuck
But there's also thousands
And thousands of varieties
That if you want to spend more
You can choose what you want to consume
The effect is different from everything
I'm personally not worried
About the industry just having
10 strains and that's it
It's not a future
I can't see that happening
It's not going to be like alcohol was post prohibition
Correct
People love the flavor
And people love the experience
But it is going to be interesting
To see more people
Who don't have a background in cannabis
Collaborate with breeders
Or cultivate
To see what the next generation
Of product looks like
I'm personally very excited about it
Because we used to get
Beasters on the east coast
We didn't have access to good weed
Until very late in the game
So when more people
Have access to good products
At whatever price point they can afford
I'm thrilled that's happening all over
So I'm incredibly optimistic
About the direction it's going in
That's awesome
And how about 10 years from now?
Oh man
What can you envision in 10 years?
Full automation?
Hands off?
There's definitely
Going to be
Some really big guys
Making some really
Commercial product
It's going to be
Interesting to see
Global cannabis tourism
That's going to be
Thrilling for me personally
To be able to go to all these
Different parts of the world
And experience cannabis culture
That was developed there
And I hope that's the stuff
That doesn't get left behind
When we were doing the Chalice Festival
In 2017
Something that was very unique
About the event
Lots of vendors
And I paid for hundreds of glassblowers
To come and attend
And have a whole showcase
I haven't seen anything like that
The Emerald Cup and all the other events
Haven't really had those nods
To the culture
That I hope get kept
One thing I can tell you about Dougie
Is Dougie will be back
He goes up and he goes down
And I think Chalice will come back
On some level
He was ahead of his time a little bit
He also paid for the way he took some
Major major risks
And got burned for them
So that some of these events
Could look the way they do today
And there's sessions popping up all over the country
That are very small
And it's just wild to think
That four years ago
It was like 30,000 people
And 400 vendors
It's so crazy
High Times comes back in the neighborhood
Absolutely crazy
I went to the Cups in Amsterdam
In Washington
Did you go to any Cups in Amsterdam?
Yeah I went to one in 2004
2005
Do you remember what the strains were back then?
I think Crepe Ape was one of the
Blue Cheese
Arianne's Hayes
Yeah good stuff
Blue Cheese
Blue Cheese is an interesting one
Every once in a while someone has some Blue Cheese
It keeps popping back up
It's a lot of noxious turf
Totally yeah
You either love it or hate it
Cheese is another thing we don't see a ton of here
Like that Exodus Cheese
It's really unique
It's good for smoking
It's a cheese by
Ozzy Cush I think
Is it good?
It's from the Carnival in LA
I gotta try that
If it has the cheese
With it's little skittles
It's loud
Yeah
You can't go wrong with loud
It's all personal preference
At that point
So James
Can I test you on something?
Sure
Okay so you said
When you guys were trimming you watched
In Living Color a lot
We did
Watch In Living Color
That was background noise
Fire Marshall Bill
Can you sing a nursery rhyme for us?
Oh god
Homie the Clown
Homie the Clown
Don't mess around
Even though the man
Try to keep him down
Yeah
Homie don't play that
Good stuff
Yeah that kind of dates us
I'm 44
Feeling all that 44 these days
Yeah super old school
Yeah it's funny
It's funny how comedy has evolved too
You gotta be careful what you say
Yeah
You gotta be PC
For sure
Well
What time is it? It's 12.06 guys
Do you have any questions for us Peter?
From the audience?
I sure do
So
Let me just throw a couple out there
And then you guys can pick some
Chingo asked
If you can talk about the Roto
I assume Canerato collaboration
Ask him about the
Potato Runts from Compound
Apples and Banana S1
Release date
Let's start
With Canerato collab
Canerato's been a friend of mine for a long time
Up to a minute in the street
We got paid by Compound
The group
Came to me from
Michigan
Really unique selection
I asked Roto to do a collaboration with it
So it's impressive
It turned out really fire
It's really unique
It's not really gassy, it's more like grape gas
It's not like OG gas, it's more like grape gas
It's really strong
Like nose burning grape
Yeah, yeah, strong grape
I read it
Of his work, and our work
It's really unique
Yeah, Canerato
That's a dude who doesn't sleep
He puts out more genetics than anybody
He puts
He basically has a large percentage
Of the market share as far as
New genetics that come out
Slays it hard
He's creating
Every year
Maybe 300-400 new varieties a year
Sometimes
Yeah, totally
It's pretty amazing
So the next one, we had a question about
Potato Runs
It's a collaboration with Nick Runs
From the Runs crew
It's across the street from Compound
He's the only here from Potato Runs
He's from a guy out of the East Coast
He's a fashion designer
He named it Potato Runs
We did the collaboration
On song 1
You hear the idea
Initially against the idea
It's an awkward name
But it's really strong
Potency
And unique to our grape variety
Has nothing to do with protesting
Mr. Potato Head by the way
We only listen to the facts
Yeah, it's pretty cool
I love it when breeders
Do small breeding projects
And release just a small amount
Regardless of the value
I think that makes it interesting
Yeah, he's been there for a while
Azul Runs
Let's talk about Azul Runs
It's one from the Runs guys
It's a blueberry
It's also called Blueberry Runs
I'm not supposed to disclose
The lineage, that's my secret
It's a Blueberry Runs cross
It's an original run by a male
I found
And they selected it in house
He's the one that originally read that
It's a really unique guy
He's a representative
So it's a cool guy
So you're working with cookies
And you're going to release how many strains
16 so far
That's pretty awesome
And those are all going to be U.S.
Half of them
On the churn right now
It's mostly made in the U.S.
Worldwide
Some more in California
Did we miss a question Peter?
Sorry
I'm eating a pastrami sandwich right now
But that one
Is from earlier
Thanks
Apples and Bananas S1
Oh yeah, there we go
Yeah
They're releasing it
Over the summer
Looking at a release on the Apples and Bananas S1
Should be some super fire
I just
I can't get enough of smoking the apples and bananas
That stuff is terpy
And then here's another one
Pineapple Pez
And Melonade TC
Clones
Going to be touchdown
Oh, so we got
You'll see the
Melonade on our spring menu
So shit
I guess
I get the spring
So now
We did a hunt on the Melonade
We found one that was particularly terpy
That also tested well
So that was a hunt that we did
The Pineapple Pez cross
Pineapple Pez by Lemon Sorbetto
By Watermelon Skittles
It's called the Pez Sours
So that's also going to be on our menu this spring
And then over the summer
It'll be on cultivated genetics menu as well
It's one of our nursery partners
Out of Sacramento
And they exclusively use tissue culture
In their deep water culture system
And they have phenomenal results
And they're like
Really awesome people
It's just really special working with them
Because I've never met more hardworking
Genuine
Happy to be a part of
This wave of the industry that's happened
There are a lot of turd nuggets in this industry
By the way
We can all attest to
And finding good people to work with
Is one of the most amazing things
When you can find those people
You hold on to them
You work with them
Hopefully forever
It's really interesting
We've all been
Part of some working arrangement
With bad people
I'm sure you guys have had some interesting experiences
With people
I think that's what makes you
And having those learning experiences
And moving on past those
Turd nuggets
As I like to call them
That's what life's all about
We're in this infancy of this industry
A lot of people think we've been around forever
But with RET going on
Everything's happening so fast
We're just moving so fast
It's really amazing to see
Not only from year to year
But from month to month
How big changes happen
It's moving lightning quick
Even genetics
I feel like
The genetics are really
They're changing
We're stuck in this gelato
But I'm excited to see what's next
What do you think is the next direction?
Do you want to fruit forward for a minute?
Sure
We can do a lot of hunts
Bigger selections
We'll find new varieties
More hunting
In gene pool
We'll find new varieties
Those real outliers
That stand out
They market themselves
Yeah
As long as it's unique
People are going to go for unique
What I see is the trends
From month to month
What's popular this month
What happened to that?
I thought that was popular
No, no, no, that's not popular anymore
You've got to have your hand on the pulse
If you're not really
You're thinking gelato 33
Is the hot one
Gelato 33 is good
It's stapled but it's not the hot one
I'm a big fan of gelato 41
The bomb was hard
For sure
So yeah
I feel like
As far as the genetics
Runts was popular but now everybody's got runts
The cuts got out
The second the cuts get out
The stuff loses traction
I feel like
Part of that is people grow shitty weed
So many people grow mids
That when you give those
Guys runts they're going to grow mids runts
And it's not going to be
I just got some
We got some the other day
It was dry runts
The flower was dry
The trips were low
The first hit
On the joint tasted like runts
But then after that it just tasted like
Are you polite
When somebody gives you that
Usually
I mean
It just depends
On who it is
If it's one of my friends
Probably not
But you know
The consistency we were talking about earlier
It's all about consistency
With growing
And the other thing with breeding
The other thing you guys do a good job of
If you're not making the plant
Express to it's fullest potential
How are you going to breed good plants
How are you going to do good selections
You're not
You're just going to go with whatever
And try to use it as a money grab
So many people are doing that
You really want to have that plant
Expressing to it's fullest potential
Or at least to where you can differentiate
If everything looks the same
And smells the same
I think that's part of what happened in Europe
They were just going by structure
And breeding for structure
OG Kush got completely fucked up over there
Turps did
There was no gas turps
With the OG Kush
You experienced that one
And then every once in a while
You'd go DNA had some
Barmass OG
Or Gray Area would have some OG
Yeah totally
What is funny
New York City Diesel
It's not related to sour diesel at all
People are still confused about that
Straight grapefruit
I love it
I bred it with the tangy
So we got purple tangy times
With my buddy OG Steve
But yeah that was like
Citrus
Seriously
That would be an interesting one for sure
So yeah what else do we got for questions
Hold on
Hold on
I just destroyed it
In about two minutes
I destroyed the whole thing
It was my father in laws
85th birthday
Or actually it's today so yesterday
We had some cats
Deli flown in with
Dry ice
That was my lunch
Yesterday and today
So any questions
Any more questions
Yeah we need some good questions
I'm sure we got a ton
I want to kind of hear
I liked watching you kind of
Evaluate each jar
Are there any more jars that you guys can
Go through
I don't know but I'll tell you
This is the pave right here
I didn't even talk to you guys about the pave
But this shit is loaded with crystals
I mean it is caked
So I saw a string
Called the chrome a while back
I showed you some of that
It was caked on the level of the pave
You usually don't see stuff this caked
That has a lot of turps
I'm used to seeing stuff like this with
Very low turps
It's strong typically
It tests really good but then
It doesn't have the nose like this
And this has a unique nose as well
It's the same for Crevo
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah I'm all about this
I'm sure it smokes really well too
It's got that
Yeah so you should
Watch it also
You watch it
I bet
Yeah it's funny
So do you breed for extract too
I'm just trying to think
What institutions breed for
It wasn't accurate
But now it's more
Characteristic
People are looking for
Totally
People are looking for good extractions
It's funny because you can have the best genetics
And it just doesn't wash well
Some stuff washes really shitty
And then you got GMO that dumps
It just dumps
Check the washing box
Yeah
That's another
It's another box
I gotta put on the list
Now we got like 30 boxes
Yeah it's too much
Where you have to have a little chart
And then you have to average them all
And it gives that number
What's kind of
The compound genetics all star team
Do you see that thing on the screen right now
What are your favorite
And what are you most proud of
The jokers, apples and bananas
Eye candy
The pave
All the resellers are hot
We'll work real time to put them to those
So do you have those out there
Also working on my fur
How about your old school stuff
What's your favorite stuff from the old school
Crypto crack
Alien labs
And horchata
Marshal OG
Ice cream man
Horchata
You can't go wrong with horchata
I love drinking horchata
I love when strains
Reflect their names
If it's called something
It should have that in it
Some breeders are like
It's going to be gummy bears
We're going to call this this
If you're going to call it a flavor
Or a description
It really should have that in there
Runts really has that runt
Skittles is the best
Skittles smells exactly
And tastes like skittles
Moving forward
We get some interesting stuff
He's really good at naming stuff
He has some creative names
It's funny
And you have guys that are just throwing stuff out there
To try to nab that name
Or maybe they have a shitty nose
I don't know
It's just
I'm going to grab this jar
I don't know what's in it
That's an India 2 OG
Black Domino
Black Domino
That's from Canapu
Oh from Canapu
I like that name
Extra stuff
This has some good gas to it
And it has really that OG
Structure with the little color
I love it
The red hairs almost go away
They get eaten up by the calyx
As the calyx fill out
And swell up
Swimming
That's a right jar
Yeah Canapu
He's a character
He loves good food
Last time I saw him I think we were in Colorado
With Brooksie
This guy Brooksie
Jason Brooks
Real good character
Good food, good beer
I'm all about experiences
This is really nice too
It's got some stickiness to it
Stick it to my finger
You know it's good when you can stick it to the finger
You know it's good when you can stick it to the finger
So what else
As far as questions
Peter are you still there?
I'm still here
I was eating a pickle
You like a Sonic sandwich?
So Chad Westport
Asked a while ago
And I'll expand the question
But it's basically
What rec shops are carrying
Your genetics kind of flowered out
In the Oregon market
And I think just in general
So you've gone into rec shops
And smoked weed
That is your stuff
Flowered out for the rec market
Oh yeah
I'm not sure about who carried it
But we launched a compound
Around September or August
To see if we could find a flower
In our own packaging
We're launching it
We're probably the finalist in the menu now
So we'll have it soon
Yeah it's awesome
There's a request
There's a request
We can read that
I'm looking at structure
In the veg state
When selecting for seed
In general size veg
Is dictated by the space you have
For flower
Chad Westport's always got interesting stuff to say
For sure
I can even
Read these questions
What's your favorite from the grape gas line
The gashapop
Gashapop part
The mellows
The switcherbottoms
The switcherbottom pie
The grape pie by Mack by Runce
Grape pie by Mack by Runce
Yeah that sounds good
It's fun
Have you tried the root beer yet?
No I have not
I have not tried it either
Me and Gene we need some root beer
Still don't know if it's real
Well the prices are real
You can auction off for real money
I'm sure it's fire
Have you tried the red pop?
I've got it recently
It's probably a good video soon
I've heard it's really neat
Yeah
I'm all about unique
Have you searched it?
No
I hear you think it's not though
Yeah I've seen it
I've seen it online
It's actually good
So with all that weed in front of you
Do you see that request on the screen?
Smoke it smoke it smoke it
We're an Alexis facility
So I don't think that's a good idea
Online
We're smoking all of this actually
We're going to enroll it in one joint
We're going to label it on the joint
You're going to be the one that's going to be
Smoking it
Yeah
I'm going to be the one that's going to be
You're going to mark
Where one thing ends
And the next thing begins
I think Raw makes a special paper for it
It's like one of those
Crayon money banks
The big ones
I don't know if you guys remember those
They look like
Yeah
Like a massive crayon
It could be Q-money from Vibes
Seriously
But yeah
Good stuff
All this stuff is fire
So yeah
We've got another couple minutes here
If we've got any more questions
Huge joint live later
We'll post it on Instagram
Live
We'll do live
First one that taps out
Has to pay for dinner
I got my money on me
Joint Horizons
Yep
Get a toilet paper
Roll and stuff it with all the weed
And light it
I think that's a bad idea
Actually
Zaki
Yeah Zashi
I guess it's really unique
You guys do that to Zashi
I did have the Zushi
It's good
Super fire
I'm all about Z-Turps
And Zerbert
I think I might have talked about it before
On the show a little bit
I met these guys in the valley
That had the Zerbert
It hits, it's good
It's got the freaking Z-Turps
But it's unique still
Which I like
The one thing is I love smoking roaches
It makes me smile
It's something about having something
That you've burned that much of
There's only that much left
It's this little black roach
There's something special about that
To be able to carry through that resin
You can't do that with a cigarette
Or a cigar
Or anything else
I don't know
So
Peter, you got any more questions
Or more pastrami sandwiches
We have a lot more pastrami in the fridge
But
Someone asked about
Where'd it go
The Yoda
Baby Yoda
Baby Yoda
Baby Yoda was kind of after
The apples and bananas
The next production
Baby Yoda will pop that
So maybe S1
S1 with apples and bananas
And then after that
Yeah, nice
I'd love to see what you can get out of S1's
I'm not sure
You know what
Send me an email and I'll answer your question
But we do have a special guest here today
I need to tell you guys about
We got Mr. Marlon Asher
He's gonna come around
Come on over Marlon
Oh in person
No, no, no
We got Marlon in person
Him and I have been hanging out all week
Working on the Ganja Farmer Seed Company
Eating candy
Are we gonna sing a song
Is this our musical interlude
I don't have $2000 to pay his
His wages
It's all good bro
It's acapella time
Nice
So yeah Marlon
Now with COVID lifting
What do you see
Well what I see is
A lot of the big concerts
Probably be
Leaning towards vaccination
You have to be vaccinated
To go home
Or attend
But
Everything is kind of opening back up
Slowly
Shows are being put together
What I'm seeing right now is that
Shows that were
Cancelled
The promoters are trying to honour their
Contract
And put on a show with the artist that was
Booked for those shows
So now they're kind of
Backlogging shows
So that's kind of something that's happening right now
Yeah
Slightly Stupid is gonna be playing sometime this summer
Right?
Oh yeah definitely
I think they got a show coming up
In the next couple months
You know that's always a plus for me
As an artist
Being able to perform
With Slightly Stupid
It just makes it
All that more worthwhile
As an artist
To have another artist
Another group that appreciates your music
And wants to showcase you
On their platform
So it's always a pleasure
To be amongst the Slightly Stupid campaign
Those are the most amazing shows
And the most talent
As far as that scene
I feel like there's more talent
It's amazing
The artists that Slightly Stupid has
Besides Kyle and Miles being badass
Yeah they're powerful
Powerful
Those two guys powerful
Switching guitars and bass
And bringing guys like you on
Every
Individual on the stage
Is an individual artist
So the music comes together
That much more powerful
Charlie Tuna
Yeah it's really
I have so much fun
Being amongst
That band
It's just ridiculous
They really know how to have a good time
And how to put on a good show
People really have fun
At a Slightly Stupid concert
That's for sure
Yeah I feel like music and cannabis
It's very much about the experience
You're providing them with an experience
On one level with your cannabis
It comes down to packaging
Everything
With seeds
You have good seed packaging
Simple and effective
And your logos
It's pretty cool
And then music
That's a whole experience as well
We're all about providing experiences
Life is about experiences
And how can we experience it to the fullest
Exactly
Because music brings on that feeling
Of
Long lasting life
It brings on that everlasting feeling
You go to a good concert
And you hear some song
That uplifts your heart
It drives you to go on
So music
Cannabis now
Is life
It perks you up
If you need a perk it up
It can give you rest
If you need rest
So music is
Only
The best
Magnet to
Put amongst cannabis
So that you will have a perfect fusion
So
Music and cannabis will always be
That force
To reckon with
If I can say that
It completes the Voltron unit
Yep
Voltron power
Cannabis brings it together
It's funny because I feel like cannabis
For me
When I do stuff
It takes me out of my head
And I'm able to just flow
I trained Jiu Jitsu
And that was one of the things
You smoke and the difference of smoking
I don't think about it I just do it
Music the same thing
Your body knows it your mind knows it
You just have to separate it
It helps you flow
Cannabis definitely puts you in that state
Yeah
In a higher state of mind
Figuratively and literally
So Ganja Farmer Seed Company
We got some interesting specials coming up
For the month of April
We're going to be on DAGA with some specials
And also seeds here now
We're doing our initial launch
Sometime in April coming up
So we got specials running through the whole month
For 420 because we're big 420 fans
Definitely we're also talking about
Launch
You know company launch party
Or even some strains will be launched
And that's
That's something for you to look out for
And try to be a part of
It's going to be something nice
Yeah we're going to be doing some launch party
In the Bay Area in the near future
We'll keep you guys posted here on the show
Follow the Instagram
ChrisCompoundGenetics
Instagram
Chris underscore compound
And then James Loud
Mr. Marlon Asher
I really appreciate you guys
Thank you for coming on the show
Really appreciate it man
It's been fun
Hopefully we'll do this again
We'll do a tour next time
We were going to do a tour today
But things fell apart
I ended up putting Nodes address in
I don't know if it was a strip club or what
But yeah
So we really appreciate it
I hope you guys have a wonderful weekend
Peter anything else in closing
I was muted
I was going to say I'm going to go outside
As soon as we're done
And I see Alex Hardy
In the chat right now
So you guys can talk
LANRACE
Oh yeah
We would love to have him on the show
I want to do a LANRACE special
To kind of go over
Everyone's opinion on LANRACE
Not just LANRACE
But genetics, origins
Get some stuff down
I feel like there's a lot of unanswered questions that I have
I consider myself
Knowledgeable
But I'm not an expert in every
Facet of cannabis
It's just impossible to be
And people that say they are
They don't know what they're talking about
We can't be experts on everything
We kind of pick our lane
And try to go with that
Learn as much as we can along the way
In closing
I really appreciate you guys for watching the show
I look forward to seeing you guys again next week
I think on Tuesday
We may pick up the LANRACE conversation
Again last week it was supposed to be
Indian LANRACE exchange
And Alex talking shop
But he fell asleep on the couch
In India late at night
Maybe I'll have to call in
Sure
I'll keep everyone posted
Alex I believe is on the
Powdery Utah ski slopes
Right now
Which I'm very jealous of
Everyone have a good rest of your Sunday
And
We may be live later today
With a clubhouse session
So see ya
See ya
