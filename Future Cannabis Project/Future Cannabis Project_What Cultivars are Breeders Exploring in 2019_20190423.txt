[00:00.000 --> 00:04.680]  You're all working on interesting stuff, and I know some of the work you're doing, all
[00:04.680 --> 00:08.800]  three of you, but you're always constantly refining and switching process.
[00:08.800 --> 00:12.000]  What's something you're excited about this year?
[00:12.000 --> 00:15.320]  Whether it's for the market or not, but what's something you're into yourself that you're
[00:15.320 --> 00:19.240]  working with you'd like to see people access in any form?
[00:19.240 --> 00:27.480]  Gosh, so many things, but I want to say on what Jason had brought up and what me and
[00:27.480 --> 00:29.360]  Jean brought up.
[00:29.360 --> 00:32.760]  Beth, did you speak this weekend?
[00:32.760 --> 00:33.760]  Beth Schecter?
[00:33.760 --> 00:34.760]  Hi.
[00:34.760 --> 00:35.760]  Hi.
[00:35.760 --> 00:43.200]  Okay, so the Open Cannabis Project looks to protect the cultivar, the strains that we're
[00:43.200 --> 00:51.760]  all known and loved for a long time, and hopefully combinations of all of them so that we can
[00:51.760 --> 00:57.200]  all keep doing the work that we've been doing, breeding and cultivating.
[00:57.200 --> 01:03.800]  And it's a nonprofit organization, and there's definitely going to be some big bad wolves
[01:03.800 --> 01:07.720]  come in to get genetics.
[01:07.720 --> 01:08.720]  And it's really hard.
[01:08.720 --> 01:09.720]  What do you do?
[01:09.720 --> 01:11.280]  You hide them away?
[01:11.280 --> 01:13.220]  Don't give them away.
[01:13.220 --> 01:18.120]  Don't come to an event like this and say, here, have a few of this and a few of that
[01:18.120 --> 01:22.520]  because maybe there's somebody in the room or something.
[01:22.520 --> 01:23.960]  It's almost impossible.
[01:23.960 --> 01:33.160]  And so we just got to kind of support an organization like that is really the best way that we can
[01:33.160 --> 01:44.880]  keep cannabis open source and keep the genetics of cannabis accessible to everybody because
[01:44.880 --> 01:51.920]  the St. Gents and the Monsantos would like to just tie up all of these strains.
[01:51.920 --> 01:59.240]  And of course, there's this phenomena that's unusual where something has been under prohibition
[01:59.240 --> 02:05.400]  for since in all of modern times, it has been basically illegal.
[02:05.400 --> 02:15.760]  So any innovation that has happened has not been documented because just like at Humboldt
[02:15.760 --> 02:20.800]  Seed Company, we keep fricking notes during the breeding season and then burn them in
[02:20.800 --> 02:26.720]  the fall because it was like, I'm not trying to keep notes around about how many goddamn
[02:26.720 --> 02:27.720]  plants I had.
[02:27.720 --> 02:28.720]  And so-
[02:28.720 --> 02:32.600]  A charge enhancement back in the day.
[02:32.600 --> 02:33.600]  What's that?
[02:33.600 --> 02:34.600]  A charge enhancement.
[02:34.800 --> 02:35.800]  Totally.
[02:35.800 --> 02:38.560]  If you were in the game, I caught an extra couple of years on a case I had to fight because
[02:38.560 --> 02:43.920]  I had spreadsheets comparing operations and it gave me a criminal mastermind charge and
[02:43.920 --> 02:47.040]  we all laughed and I said, if I was so smart, I wouldn't get fucking caught.
[02:47.040 --> 02:53.560]  But nonetheless, the enhancement was really punishing because I was using tools to document
[02:53.560 --> 02:54.560]  work.
[02:54.560 --> 02:57.880]  It was impossible to keep this much data when you're running this many operations.
[02:57.880 --> 03:02.400]  And I had my hand in a lot of cookie jars way back in the day.
[03:02.400 --> 03:12.960]  And so those folks that look to capitalize so much could easily come in and try to say
[03:12.960 --> 03:18.520]  that they've created something that's new when really, I mean, Gene's been breeding
[03:18.520 --> 03:22.440]  it for 20 goddamn years and so on and so forth.
[03:22.440 --> 03:25.200]  So that's a good organization to support.
[03:25.200 --> 03:28.160]  I really appreciate what Beth's done.
[03:28.160 --> 03:37.960]  And as far as some exciting stuff that we're doing, I think really that big phenotype hunt
[03:37.960 --> 03:42.200]  effort was exciting for me.
[03:42.200 --> 03:45.520]  And what else is-
[03:45.520 --> 03:47.760]  Are you going to release the product this year?
[03:47.760 --> 03:48.760]  Yeah.
[03:48.760 --> 03:49.760]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:49.760 --> 03:55.680]  We're actually dropping the sort of selected cuts like Daniel's farm.
[03:55.680 --> 04:02.040]  We picked one that we're calling magic melon and that one just really smells like melons
[04:02.040 --> 04:08.720]  and it's kind of gassy fuel finish.
[04:08.720 --> 04:10.560]  But yeah, I don't know.
[04:10.560 --> 04:25.880]  I feel really just happy to be able to work in cannabis and share the genetics and definitely
[04:25.880 --> 04:27.320]  like what it did.
[04:27.320 --> 04:32.840]  I got an email the other day and I looked at the email and I thought it was kind of
[04:32.840 --> 04:33.840]  weird.
[04:33.840 --> 04:38.320]  It said burpee in the email.
[04:38.920 --> 04:44.320]  So I replied to the email and did some fishing and sure enough, it was burpee.
[04:44.320 --> 04:48.640]  And I don't know, are they big bad wolf or not?
[04:48.640 --> 04:53.400]  I didn't follow the corporate ladder all the way up, but that's the kind of stuff that's
[04:53.400 --> 04:54.400]  happening.
[04:54.400 --> 05:04.720]  So definitely be careful, but we got to keep charging forward.
[05:04.720 --> 05:12.480]  So exciting things, just breeding more and more all the time.
[05:12.480 --> 05:17.760]  And we're doing some genotyping and putting it in the public space.
[05:17.760 --> 05:26.040]  So that's a way that you can, once you do that, if you don't patent it in a year, then
[05:26.040 --> 05:30.920]  it becomes public domain.
[05:30.920 --> 05:41.000]  And so that's what I would call defensive IP versus offensive IP, which is getting a
[05:41.000 --> 05:48.880]  patent and sending out cease and desist letters to everybody in the room who doesn't pay you
[05:48.880 --> 05:52.920]  a fee for growing it or whatever.
[05:52.920 --> 05:59.760]  And I think that there's, I'm not saying I'm completely opposed to patents, but I think
[05:59.800 --> 06:04.520]  definitely that it's a slippery slope.
[06:04.520 --> 06:14.840]  And so there's a lot of things out there that should just be public domain.
[06:14.840 --> 06:21.280]  I mean, if I could just take a snapshot of the whole cannabis space right now and make
[06:21.280 --> 06:25.760]  sure that that could continue to be the way it is and people could continue to grow the
[06:25.760 --> 06:34.240]  I think that would be a good thing to do, but it costs a lot of money to genotype.
[06:34.240 --> 06:37.800]  So that's not the only solution too.
[06:37.800 --> 06:40.120]  There's other ways to go about it.
[06:40.120 --> 06:44.360]  But yeah, so that's exciting.
[06:44.360 --> 06:50.120]  He's like, I'm excited about the weeping days.
[06:50.120 --> 06:51.120]  I don't want to doom and gloom.
[06:51.120 --> 06:52.120]  No, no, no.
[06:52.120 --> 06:55.720]  But no, but the thing is though, we're all in the real, everyone in the room is in the
[06:55.720 --> 06:56.720]  real.
[06:56.720 --> 07:01.600]  And a lot of it is the struggle because that's so much the reality of what you're having
[07:01.600 --> 07:02.600]  to deal with.
[07:02.600 --> 07:09.640]  And what I want to make sure though, is that the things that you see and that interest
[07:09.640 --> 07:14.840]  you because you guys are, you're the painters that create the ink that we use to do our
[07:14.840 --> 07:16.400]  work.
[07:16.400 --> 07:18.200]  And so you broke out the melon.
[07:18.200 --> 07:20.960]  And so the thing was, you say, Hey, no, what we found was something that was unbelievably
[07:20.960 --> 07:23.040]  Melanie with the beautiful fuel back.
[07:23.040 --> 07:26.800]  And we think it would be attractive and it'd be valuable for the market.
[07:26.800 --> 07:29.760]  And that's what I'm seeking from it.
[07:29.760 --> 07:33.600]  And the part about us all struggling is as real as it can be.
[07:33.600 --> 07:38.640]  And I try to make light of it because otherwise you go home and cry and tissue paper is expensive.
[07:38.640 --> 07:43.240]  So what about you, Big Gene?
[07:43.240 --> 07:44.600]  What you messing around with?
[07:44.600 --> 07:46.120]  What directions do you go with your lines?
[07:46.120 --> 07:50.760]  Because you work some lines that you've had for a long time, but you switch the direction
[07:50.760 --> 07:54.000]  on them and it's kind of neat because it lets you swing a picture.
[07:54.000 --> 07:55.000]  Yeah.
[07:55.000 --> 08:01.720]  I mean, what I'd really like to do is do, I'll do the, I'll do those fresh hybrids and
[08:01.720 --> 08:08.320]  then try to go through and seed a lot of plants every time I do anything.
[08:08.320 --> 08:12.020]  So then I think you can go in all these different directions.
[08:12.020 --> 08:17.440]  So when you make that, that fresh hybrid, you get, you know, if stuff is, if stuff is
[08:17.440 --> 08:24.640]  fairly consistent, you start with, then you get a pretty, you get a pretty, it's pretty
[08:24.640 --> 08:26.360]  predictable to know what you're going to get.
[08:26.360 --> 08:28.840]  But then when you make that F2, you get all the weirdness.
[08:28.840 --> 08:32.240]  And then when you go, when you get all the weirdness, then that's where you can really,
[08:32.240 --> 08:35.120]  you can make one thing into a million things, you know?
[08:35.120 --> 08:40.640]  So with, with some of them, I've tried to take them different directions.
[08:40.640 --> 08:43.760]  And then some of them is just a real clear direction.
[08:43.760 --> 08:49.680]  But like this year I'm really trying to work on like the root beer stuff.
[08:49.680 --> 08:56.400]  That's really cool because it's, it's a trip like with doing seeds, there's a whole lot
[08:56.400 --> 08:59.440]  of seeds that are really interesting and they're, and they're awesome.
[08:59.440 --> 09:04.680]  And like they all are, you know, really valid in the space as far as going, okay, we need
[09:04.680 --> 09:06.220]  to have all these things.
[09:06.220 --> 09:10.560]  But it's really a trip because when you go to actually sell a lot of weed, it kind of
[09:10.560 --> 09:12.200]  has to look a certain way.
[09:12.200 --> 09:17.640]  It has to have, you know, there has to be something about it where it's like, okay,
[09:17.640 --> 09:18.640]  that's shiny.
[09:18.640 --> 09:21.160]  That has, people really like a little color to it.
[09:21.160 --> 09:27.060]  It has to at least have a silver look, if not dark or purple or blue or red or whatever,
[09:27.060 --> 09:32.240]  you know, regular green bud better be really tasty and really stinky to be able to compete,
[09:32.240 --> 09:33.240]  you know?
[09:33.240 --> 09:37.960]  So like the root beer is a cool one because of the, the way it smokes, the way it grows,
[09:37.960 --> 09:38.960]  all that stuff.
[09:38.960 --> 09:44.280]  So what I'm trying to do, like I backcrossed to that clone twice and the original male
[09:44.280 --> 09:47.000]  I started with was almost the same thing.
[09:47.000 --> 09:51.560]  So it was already pretty consistent right away.
[09:51.560 --> 09:56.400]  And then going back to it a couple of times made it, made it really nice.
[09:56.400 --> 10:01.560]  And then what I'm going to try to do with that is I'll probably go back one more time
[10:01.560 --> 10:05.400]  to the root beer clone to make it so that it's like really root beer seed.
[10:05.400 --> 10:07.960]  Because it has got more and more frequent when you backcross.
[10:07.960 --> 10:12.520]  Not everything does that if it's too inconsistent, it throws too much weird stuff, you know,
[10:12.520 --> 10:13.520]  but it comes through.
[10:13.520 --> 10:15.800]  So it dominates in the crosses.
[10:15.800 --> 10:19.200]  And and then, but I think what I'm going to do while it's still just a little more open
[10:19.200 --> 10:23.520]  at the, at the, at the two back crosses, I'm probably going to do a bunch of out crosses
[10:23.520 --> 10:28.920]  of it this year and then do the same thing with the cherry limeade.
[10:28.920 --> 10:34.240]  And the reason being that when you get, like if you go to get clones from somebody, you
[10:34.240 --> 10:35.240]  know how it is.
[10:35.240 --> 10:39.480]  It's like you have to, everything's cool to have some like, okay, I'm going to have some
[10:39.480 --> 10:40.880]  of this, I'm going to have some of that.
[10:40.880 --> 10:45.320]  But when people like want units and weight of something, you have to be able to have
[10:45.320 --> 10:46.760]  something that people look at.
[10:46.760 --> 10:51.600]  And even if they don't know the name, it's recognizably what they, is in their paradigm
[10:51.600 --> 10:52.600]  of what's the dink.
[10:52.600 --> 10:57.800]  Some of the best weed might look like shoelaces and be all messed up and look like Dr. Greenspoon
[10:57.800 --> 10:59.400]  or something, you know.
[10:59.400 --> 11:04.280]  But when you, when you really want something that you can have in your bag to people go,
[11:04.280 --> 11:08.280]  okay, you just want that instant, yep, there it is.
[11:08.280 --> 11:10.660]  And so those are things that do that.
[11:10.660 --> 11:12.760]  You open the bag, I want that.
[11:12.760 --> 11:20.560]  So like I'm trying to do that because when you, you know, you want to have plants that
[11:20.560 --> 11:24.920]  grow well for you as a farmer and then you need a product that's really going to be that
[11:24.920 --> 11:25.920]  thing.
[11:25.920 --> 11:28.560]  And that's the whole thing I was talking about with like with brand recognitions.
[11:28.720 --> 11:30.640]  It's like people go, oh, it's hype, it's hype, it's hype.
[11:30.640 --> 11:34.480]  It's like, well, hype, hype doesn't last.
[11:34.480 --> 11:38.280]  So like I remember when cookies came out, it was like, that's hype, it's not good.
[11:38.280 --> 11:44.900]  It's like, well, maybe it's not as good as it's not as strong as headband or cam or whatever
[11:44.900 --> 11:46.520]  is your thing.
[11:46.520 --> 11:51.860]  But you're, you know, it's like if, if it was just hype, it wouldn't be here 10 years
[11:51.860 --> 11:53.320]  after I got it.
[11:53.320 --> 11:56.080]  It's still here and all the crosses are still that.
[11:56.080 --> 11:59.440]  And when you really get into it, you go, okay, this is cool stuff.
[11:59.440 --> 12:04.080]  But the reason why it's valuable to grow it is because you know, when you finish it, you
[12:04.080 --> 12:05.160]  can sell it.
[12:05.160 --> 12:09.280]  Like if you're a tomato farmer, you know, most people are going to wind up like, okay,
[12:09.280 --> 12:10.440]  this one has shelf life.
[12:10.440 --> 12:11.440]  It's good.
[12:11.440 --> 12:12.440]  Boom.
[12:12.440 --> 12:13.440]  We're going to grow these Romas.
[12:13.440 --> 12:16.280]  We want to grow these really cool heirloom rainbow tomatoes.
[12:16.280 --> 12:19.400]  But when you go in the store, there's only a little bit of those.
[12:19.400 --> 12:24.620]  Over here, you got this whole tier of these Romas over here, whatever, beefsteaks or whatever.
[12:24.620 --> 12:26.260]  So we're going to grow those.
[12:26.260 --> 12:29.260]  So you need things to fit in people's paradigm.
[12:29.260 --> 12:33.580]  So I'm trying to put out some stuff that's really like people go, oh, it's the hype stuff.
[12:33.580 --> 12:35.540]  Oh, it's just, it's another gelato cross.
[12:35.540 --> 12:36.880]  It's this or it's that.
[12:36.880 --> 12:40.960]  But it's a trip because if you don't have something that people on a knee jerk reaction
[12:40.960 --> 12:44.500]  will look at and go, that's the stuff, that's what everybody wants.
[12:44.500 --> 12:47.580]  Then are you, do you really want to have 350 pounds of it?
[12:47.580 --> 12:51.700]  And you, you want to, you want to have a quarter pound for your head or whatever to share.
[12:51.700 --> 12:55.740]  And you know, maybe you got somebody who wants this or that, but you know, I'm just
[12:55.740 --> 12:59.580]  trying to really make sure that like the stuff that I'm putting out is stuff that when you're
[12:59.580 --> 13:02.860]  done with it, it's what people come back.
[13:02.860 --> 13:06.620]  That's like this last stuff I released was like I had that pina, the pina a lot of times
[13:06.620 --> 13:09.700]  a CBD plant, but it's super hardy.
[13:09.700 --> 13:11.020]  It's structures grade.
[13:11.020 --> 13:12.960]  It does, we'll not get PM.
[13:12.960 --> 13:17.500]  It's like so easy and such a great, you know, you could probably dry farm and I haven't
[13:17.500 --> 13:21.900]  done it yet, but I have seen my buddy leave the Pina cross cherries that I made in some
[13:21.900 --> 13:27.900]  three gallon pots basically in a, in a desert, in a, in a greenhouse that wasn't being grown
[13:27.900 --> 13:28.900]  in.
[13:28.900 --> 13:32.460]  So it was like 130 degree desert in there every day.
[13:32.460 --> 13:36.020]  And the plants, he watered them when they were starts, they never grew, but then they
[13:36.020 --> 13:40.740]  budded and they finished and there was this killer weed in there that we basically found
[13:40.740 --> 13:41.740]  going to his house.
[13:41.740 --> 13:47.040]  And I was like, well, that's got value too, you know, but, but it's weed that when people,
[13:47.580 --> 13:50.840]  you know, originally I was like, it's CBD, people only want Kush.
[13:50.840 --> 13:52.200]  I'd have a little bit of it.
[13:52.200 --> 13:54.880]  People would show up and they'd be like, no, we want more of those.
[13:54.880 --> 13:55.880]  We want that one.
[13:55.880 --> 14:01.880]  So that's, you know, something, trying to put stuff out that's actually like can really
[14:01.880 --> 14:03.800]  be practical for people that are farming.
[14:03.800 --> 14:06.760]  It's like the Sky Cuddler Kush, like that's Nekona's favorite weed.
[14:06.760 --> 14:08.240]  You know, it's like got the knee jerk.
[14:08.240 --> 14:09.240]  Okay, this is cool.
[14:09.240 --> 14:10.240]  I understand it.
[14:10.240 --> 14:12.040]  It smells gassy.
[14:12.040 --> 14:16.080]  But as a grower too, it's really performing, you know?
[14:16.120 --> 14:22.640]  So that's just the focus of like the stuff that I'm working on in general is to be like
[14:22.640 --> 14:23.640]  that.
[14:23.640 --> 14:27.840]  Like I love the lime and the lime is great, but the lime is a little bit more, it's a
[14:27.840 --> 14:30.000]  little more leafy when you grow it.
[14:30.000 --> 14:33.320]  It's so, I'm trying to work it into a little bit more different stuff.
[14:33.320 --> 14:37.680]  So it's like cross it back with the OG, keeps the nose, gets a little meat on the bones.
[14:37.680 --> 14:38.960]  That's what the Lime Pop Kush is.
[14:38.960 --> 14:41.600]  You get the huge plants if you're growing big plants.
[14:41.600 --> 14:44.480]  So I've been working on that.
[14:44.560 --> 14:50.360]  Then I made, like I took like the Cherry Limeade F5 and I put it on gelato, sherb, you know,
[14:50.360 --> 14:53.720]  things that you're like, oh, that's a stupid, but it's like, yeah, but that's what people
[14:53.720 --> 14:55.500]  want in their bag to buy.
[14:55.500 --> 14:58.260]  So you got to have that, you know what I mean?
[14:58.260 --> 15:03.840]  So that's kind of the stuff I've been trying to work on more stuff that's like that.
[15:03.840 --> 15:09.480]  And then at the same time, I'm always doing my regular stuff that's for me that I, you
[15:09.480 --> 15:11.920]  know, that I vibe with even more.
[15:12.600 --> 15:17.280]  You know, you can't help but also vibe with something that you look at and you go, whoa,
[15:17.280 --> 15:18.280]  well, that's incredible.
[15:18.280 --> 15:24.280]  I mean, I went to the Ego Clash in Hopland down there and I saw all the stuff and everybody
[15:24.280 --> 15:29.400]  go, I walked up and they go, which one, which one, you know, would you say would be good
[15:29.400 --> 15:30.400]  out of there?
[15:30.400 --> 15:32.280]  And I missed the part where you smoke and all that.
[15:32.280 --> 15:38.800]  And I just looked in the case and I was all that number 14, that looks like that's fire
[15:38.800 --> 15:39.800]  right there.
[15:39.800 --> 15:41.160]  I don't know what it is, but it looks good.
[15:41.400 --> 15:44.400]  It's got that good old school Gany frosted up look.
[15:44.400 --> 15:49.320]  And then they announced the winner and they're like, oh, the number 14, Gelato 41 or something,
[15:49.320 --> 15:50.320]  you know?
[15:50.320 --> 15:51.880]  And I was like, oh, all right.
[15:51.880 --> 15:58.400]  Well, I mean, you can't really argue with you can't just hype, cookie, strain, whatever.
[15:58.400 --> 15:59.960]  You can't argue, you know?
[15:59.960 --> 16:00.960]  Yeah.
[16:00.960 --> 16:05.160]  I learned that from a guy that was in fashion and I've not historically been known as someone
[16:05.160 --> 16:06.800]  who's been fashionable.
[16:06.800 --> 16:10.120]  So I asked people who are fashionable about, you know, fashion.
[16:10.120 --> 16:14.760]  And they said, you can't argue with trends that people do because what you're saying
[16:14.760 --> 16:18.840]  is that you're not intelligent enough to recognize that they made the choice to do it.
[16:18.840 --> 16:21.900]  And so what happens is you cut yourself right out of the trend.
[16:21.900 --> 16:23.400]  And I think that's the same with what you're talking about.
[16:23.400 --> 16:27.880]  The plants at the bottom line is if, if 41 cut wasn't hot, then why is it moving at a
[16:27.880 --> 16:30.080]  rate that's supernatural?
[16:30.080 --> 16:35.880]  And it doesn't mean you need to jump on it, but you need to understand why the, why, what
[16:35.880 --> 16:39.000]  I learned from someone is two, there's two things in life, those that know how, and those
[16:39.000 --> 16:43.280]  that know why, and those that know how work for those that know why.
[16:43.280 --> 16:45.640]  And for us, it's the why, it's what's important for us.
[16:45.640 --> 16:48.480]  Otherwise we end up just being how, how do we make it?
[16:48.480 --> 16:52.880]  And we want to understand why are we making it and what is that direction?
[16:52.880 --> 16:57.340]  And I agree, man, I see all these modern cultivars that are red hot and I go, I got you.
[16:57.340 --> 17:02.280]  Some of them aren't my personal preference, but I don't deny the fact that it moves at
[17:02.280 --> 17:04.640]  an unbelievable velocity.
[17:04.640 --> 17:10.480]  And when you do objective testing where I take, I take things that I think are hot and
[17:10.480 --> 17:16.040]  I give them to people who are in markets that are unbelievably picky and they have money,
[17:16.040 --> 17:18.260]  which means they have access.
[17:18.260 --> 17:24.840]  And I let them run them to find out compared to each other, which one has the velocity.
[17:24.840 --> 17:29.400]  And then it lets me really understand of these elites, which one really is the attraction
[17:29.400 --> 17:30.480]  and why.
[17:30.480 --> 17:35.040]  And it also lets me understand which ones didn't I think had the attraction.
[17:35.040 --> 17:38.360]  I go, whoa, the market still likes that.
[17:38.360 --> 17:44.900]  But so much of it is that visual appearance and you've been trained to choose those things
[17:44.900 --> 17:48.620]  because that's what we've got the last 30 years in cannabis.
[17:48.620 --> 17:52.280]  And I always tell people some of the strongest pot I ever smoked, it looked like it was a
[17:52.280 --> 17:55.560]  piece of cabbage run over by a tractor.
[17:55.560 --> 17:59.140]  And it got me so high that I had to drive around the island three times because I couldn't
[17:59.140 --> 18:01.900]  figure out how to get off the highway on the on-ramp.
[18:01.900 --> 18:05.860]  And I was out in Hawaii and I got so lit that I couldn't really get off the freeway and
[18:05.860 --> 18:08.780]  I laughed and I just said, screw it, I'll just drive it out.
[18:08.780 --> 18:12.460]  And at some point I'll come down and I'll be able to figure out how do you get off the
[18:12.460 --> 18:13.460]  freeway?
[18:13.460 --> 18:20.660]  You know, and I wasn't laughing at the moment because I was like, whoa, I am scorched.
[18:20.660 --> 18:23.140]  But if I could get my hands on that again, I'd love it.
[18:23.140 --> 18:27.700]  But the thing was, you know, I challenge you to sell it because it looked like it was some
[18:27.700 --> 18:29.660]  cabbage run over by a tractor.
[18:29.660 --> 18:30.660]  Yeah.
[18:30.660 --> 18:31.660]  Yeah.
[18:31.660 --> 18:32.660]  Yeah.
[18:32.660 --> 18:35.940]  So that's what it's like, you know, like, oh yeah, gelato, just gelato cross.
[18:35.940 --> 18:36.940]  You know what I mean?
[18:36.940 --> 18:38.300]  Like, yeah, I made a gelato cross.
[18:38.300 --> 18:39.620]  I made a sherb cross.
[18:39.620 --> 18:45.220]  Like the male I started with though was an F5 and those generations to get to F3 took
[18:45.220 --> 18:47.100]  a while out of the twos.
[18:47.100 --> 18:49.980]  To get to the four took a while out of the threes.
[18:49.980 --> 18:53.220]  It's not like I just went one, two, three, four, five, boom, man, gelato.
[18:53.220 --> 18:55.660]  And even that is a lot of work.
[18:55.660 --> 18:58.060]  But you know, going along the way to go, okay, cool.
[18:58.060 --> 18:59.060]  We got rid of this.
[18:59.060 --> 19:00.060]  We got rid of that.
[19:00.060 --> 19:03.660]  I mean, I think you probably grew some of the early cherry generations that I had that
[19:03.660 --> 19:09.180]  have all the weird urkel recessives in it that pop out with a little duck foot and they're
[19:09.180 --> 19:11.860]  tiny and they won't grow and the weed is amazing.
[19:11.860 --> 19:12.860]  Incredible quality.
[19:12.860 --> 19:13.860]  It won't do anything.
[19:13.860 --> 19:14.860]  So you got to get both.
[19:14.860 --> 19:20.260]  And then so now, like I have cherry lime F6s and if you grow those, they're all big, fast
[19:20.260 --> 19:21.580]  vegging plants.
[19:21.580 --> 19:23.720]  They all have the same bud structure.
[19:23.720 --> 19:32.080]  They all have the super high 5% terpenes at SC, 18, 22% THC, real consistent, all the
[19:32.080 --> 19:36.440]  same, doesn't mold, doesn't break, doesn't care if it's windy.
[19:36.440 --> 19:43.120]  You know, and then take that, like what I used to make that, and then that was outcrossed
[19:43.120 --> 19:46.080]  to these, you know, height, whatever.
[19:46.080 --> 19:49.680]  And so then, you know, with that, then you at least know you've got some predictability
[19:50.680 --> 19:55.520]  And at the same time, you have marketability so that you're bringing, because you've got
[19:55.520 --> 20:01.480]  to, there's only so many enthusiasts and all of us enthusiasts can go ahead and go, okay,
[20:01.480 --> 20:02.480]  cool.
[20:02.480 --> 20:04.840]  Yeah, this is this really rare weed thing.
[20:04.840 --> 20:08.280]  You know, like this is this trippy, like it's out there.
[20:08.280 --> 20:15.120]  Like Caleb right now is working with that Australian bastard cannabis and people are
[20:15.120 --> 20:16.120]  like, why would you want this?
[20:16.120 --> 20:19.960]  I'm like, if you really like plants, you want that because it's not the other one you
[20:19.960 --> 20:24.720]  have, but you're not going to go, okay, I'm going to switch over my hoops to this.
[20:24.720 --> 20:28.440]  People are going to go, once it's trimmed in the bag, it probably isn't even different
[20:28.440 --> 20:32.060]  because the leaves are cut off and the leaves are what's cool and it has valuable things
[20:32.060 --> 20:33.640]  and you want to have it in your arsenal.
[20:33.640 --> 20:38.700]  I looked right at it and went, if I can get a plant that's like a bomb ass Afghani to
[20:38.700 --> 20:44.120]  grow with this size leaves, you're going to have yields that are going to crush everything
[20:44.440 --> 20:48.760]  because if you can get a fat bud on something that veggies faster than that with a tiny
[20:48.760 --> 20:52.280]  little leaf, it's just going to get sun right to the bud the whole way.
[20:52.280 --> 20:56.480]  So you're going to have these huge buds like this, but instead of being on the end with
[20:56.480 --> 21:01.400]  these big fat leaves that block everything out, you're going to have them six feet long.
[21:01.400 --> 21:05.720]  So that's where you get like the cool stuff and those things are valuable for breeders,
[21:05.720 --> 21:06.720]  but you buy a pack of seeds.
[21:06.720 --> 21:11.000]  You're like, dude, I want to grow this and maybe I want to find a clone or I just want
[21:11.000 --> 21:12.480]  to grow these and just have good bud.
[21:12.840 --> 21:15.520]  I try to make sure that my seed, you plan a row of it.
[21:15.520 --> 21:20.160]  I have to be able to plan a row of it and have 10 or 20 of them in hundreds or three
[21:20.160 --> 21:24.160]  hundreds or whatever and look at them and go, okay, cool.
[21:24.160 --> 21:25.840]  I'm glad I grew that in my garden.
[21:25.840 --> 21:27.160]  So that's what I try to do.
[21:27.160 --> 21:34.400]  That's what I try to put out, but with the new stuff too, I'm trying to make sure it's
[21:34.400 --> 21:38.880]  always kind of a cutting edge turps and something that fits into the picture.
[21:39.880 --> 21:40.880]  Pre-marketed.
[21:40.880 --> 21:41.880]  Yeah.
[21:41.880 --> 21:42.880]  Just to make good, smart business.
[21:42.880 --> 21:43.880]  Yeah.
[21:43.880 --> 21:45.880]  And that's what I was saying about to loop back.
[21:45.880 --> 21:50.200]  What's cool about the root beer is it almost looks like a cookies or it looks like it's
[21:50.200 --> 21:54.360]  something like that, but it's because it has black Afi in it way back in it in Hindu and
[21:54.360 --> 21:58.560]  then it has the headband, the LA Kush like Mandel had back in the day.
[21:58.560 --> 22:01.640]  And so it makes it like this ultra potent thing.
[22:01.640 --> 22:05.680]  Like if you're used to smoking cookies and you smoke this, you're like, whew, okay, this
[22:05.680 --> 22:07.800]  is super satisfying smoke.
[22:07.800 --> 22:11.840]  You know, it breaks up a little better and it's got, you know, just really killer.
[22:11.840 --> 22:17.240]  So those are, those are ones that are, um, that are going and that's the, that's the
[22:17.240 --> 22:21.240]  thing maintaining those cool, that cool, all that neat stuff.
[22:21.240 --> 22:24.880]  And then being able to go, okay, here's what we need to be competitive.
[22:24.880 --> 22:30.440]  Cause we do have to be super competitive and all you really need is a plant that is that
[22:30.440 --> 22:34.800]  special and people will go, oh, okay, I got it.
[22:34.800 --> 22:35.800]  Like it's good.
[22:35.800 --> 22:37.560]  It's great for everyone to share everything.
[22:38.320 --> 22:41.880]  It's great for everyone to share, especially these bulk, these, these, these bulk gene
[22:41.880 --> 22:43.200]  pools.
[22:43.200 --> 22:44.200]  You know what I mean?
[22:44.200 --> 22:47.880]  But like if you have your own clone and everyone's like, oh, you can't get like, maybe you don't
[22:47.880 --> 22:49.080]  want to give that clone away.
[22:49.080 --> 22:52.680]  Cause maybe you want to have something that you're like, no, I know how to do this.
[22:52.680 --> 22:53.920]  You might talk to someone's grandma.
[22:53.920 --> 22:59.000]  She's like, sorry, you can't have my cookie recipe now because it's, I want to have this.
[22:59.000 --> 23:03.080]  I want to win the, I want to win the contest at the whatever, you know what I mean?
[23:03.080 --> 23:04.400]  Or whatever it's for.
[23:04.400 --> 23:06.920]  Like there's a, there's a, there's something to that, you know?
[23:07.280 --> 23:11.720]  So like definitely everyone's got to share, but it, there's a, there's a huge edge to
[23:11.720 --> 23:16.880]  being able to go, okay, I have this thing and I'm the only one with it.
[23:16.880 --> 23:18.920]  And it's something for everyone to think about that.
[23:18.920 --> 23:25.240]  Find that plant where, you know, you, you're, you might not be able to sell SFV.
[23:25.240 --> 23:29.480]  You're like, oh, I, I was getting, you know, three grand for this SFV.
[23:29.480 --> 23:32.040]  Now people want to give me 600.
[23:32.040 --> 23:33.280]  Everything's crashed.
[23:33.280 --> 23:36.960]  But then you go to talk to somebody and they're like, dude, I have this one.
[23:36.960 --> 23:41.400]  And no matter what, everybody, my buddy's got this Vermont diesel.
[23:41.400 --> 23:46.440]  It's like pre-sour diesel, diesel, you know, like I don't know if it really is, but that's
[23:46.440 --> 23:47.440]  how it is.
[23:47.440 --> 23:48.720]  It's like just straight, like super skunk.
[23:48.720 --> 23:50.480]  It smells like skunk.
[23:50.480 --> 23:54.160]  And then underneath it's just like clove and it's super, super bomb.
[23:54.160 --> 23:56.480]  And he just calls it diesel.
[23:56.480 --> 24:02.640]  And anybody who looks at that and they tell you, oh, sorry, this is good indoor, but I'm
[24:03.000 --> 24:04.480]  only going to give you a thousand for it.
[24:04.480 --> 24:05.480]  You're like, cool.
[24:05.480 --> 24:06.480]  Where's the next guy?
[24:06.480 --> 24:11.800]  Cause one out of three people who smell this shit are going to say, dude, what do you want?
[24:11.800 --> 24:16.800]  Like if I have that, I can sell that to people for whatever I want to ask for it.
[24:16.800 --> 24:18.560]  And it's just because people don't all have it.
[24:18.560 --> 24:21.440]  If everyone has it, people see a bad version of it.
[24:21.440 --> 24:24.040]  Now all of a sudden it's whatever it is.
[24:24.040 --> 24:25.040]  It's cool.
[24:25.040 --> 24:29.760]  It's cush, but there's definitely like a value in that of looking for your own thing, having
[24:29.760 --> 24:38.000]  it and being able to run with something that's got a little edge on it.
[24:38.000 --> 24:43.000]  So that's what I'm always doing, trying to make stuff like that.
[24:43.000 --> 24:49.000]  I told, gee, that's absolutely right.
[24:49.000 --> 24:57.120]  And when I look around this room, I think what the reality is, is that so many of us,
[24:57.200 --> 25:03.040]  if you think of it's a race or whatever, a racetrack, so many of us are actually like
[25:03.040 --> 25:09.680]  lapping the whole industry that it's easy to look like you're behind, but we're really
[25:09.680 --> 25:11.800]  all just like so far ahead.
[25:11.800 --> 25:17.280]  And so like what Jean was saying, it's like sometimes you gotta give them what they want.
[25:17.280 --> 25:25.040]  And so you do a few gelato crosses or make sure everything is a certain THC level for
[25:25.040 --> 25:31.400]  the year, but never ever give up on those cultivars that mean everything to you.
[25:31.400 --> 25:36.960]  I mean, I can't like back, God, eight, nine years ago, people would give me such a hard
[25:36.960 --> 25:42.760]  time and be like, why do you have seeds that make purple cannabis?
[25:42.760 --> 25:43.760]  Everybody hates purple.
[25:43.760 --> 25:47.640]  They were like, oh, it's because it's deficient.
[25:47.640 --> 25:52.240]  Your weed's purple because it's deficient in whatever, something they tell me.
[25:52.240 --> 25:55.000]  And I'd be like, no, it's not.
[25:55.000 --> 25:59.840]  And this is like, so the trends and I guess the whole lapping thing, like we're always
[25:59.840 --> 26:05.920]  like one lap ahead and sometimes it can look like we're kind of behind the pack, but really
[26:05.920 --> 26:09.480]  we're just like ahead of it and nobody knows it yet.
[26:09.480 --> 26:12.480]  So I think that's where Jean would talk.
[26:12.480 --> 26:15.580]  Yeah.
[26:15.580 --> 26:16.580]  So.
[26:16.580 --> 26:18.860]  Yeah, no, same thing.
[26:18.860 --> 26:22.660]  You got a lot of killer stuff.
[26:22.660 --> 26:25.780]  You work some interesting directions since I've met you.
[26:25.780 --> 26:29.340]  And I like that, you know, you've been, you've been really putting together some interesting
[26:29.340 --> 26:35.260]  combinations and the number of people that bring me material that you've done is, I got
[26:35.260 --> 26:36.260]  some in my jaw right now.
[26:36.260 --> 26:38.300]  Someone said, man, I got some killer equilibrium working.
[26:38.300 --> 26:39.300]  I said, oh nice.
[26:39.300 --> 26:40.460]  What is it?
[26:40.460 --> 26:45.300]  And I laugh because each one of those samples was radically different than the other because
[26:45.300 --> 26:47.300]  the lines were different.
[26:47.300 --> 26:52.500]  And I, I like that when I see people have separation in what they're doing and your
[26:52.500 --> 26:55.020]  desires to go these different trends.
[26:55.020 --> 26:56.620]  And so you've been, you've been putting some cool stuff.
[26:56.620 --> 26:57.620]  What have you been, what are you doing?
[26:57.620 --> 26:58.620]  What are you going on?
[26:58.620 --> 27:03.260]  I'm, I'm, I think this year I'm going to try to dig deeper into, I've got so many seeds
[27:03.260 --> 27:08.260]  and so many things I've collected over the years and I kind of want to, I like that branching
[27:08.260 --> 27:12.820]  out in a whole new direction, just like kind of out sideways somewhere where maybe it's
[27:12.820 --> 27:16.260]  something that's been sitting on the shelf that I've been meaning to get to forever.
[27:16.260 --> 27:20.140]  And I haven't decided anything I'm going to work with yet this year, but there's, there's
[27:20.140 --> 27:21.540]  a few contenders.
[27:21.540 --> 27:26.020]  The Malawi lines did really well, you know, over the years there's been a lot of people
[27:26.020 --> 27:29.300]  coming back saying the African orange was something that was really mold resistant for
[27:29.300 --> 27:30.300]  them.
[27:30.300 --> 27:33.540]  And I've seen some of the flowers that somebody, you know, brought me some of the flowers today
[27:33.540 --> 27:38.420]  from Humboldt that was, that was just probably one of the most citrusy versions of African
[27:38.420 --> 27:40.500]  orange I've ever seen.
[27:40.500 --> 27:47.060]  And that's certainly a direction I want to go in is things that do well on the coast
[27:47.060 --> 27:51.620]  because I've been in, you know, I was in Santa Cruz for so many years and it's, it's hard
[27:51.620 --> 27:56.660]  to grow almost anything in a lot of the areas around that county.
[27:56.660 --> 28:01.060]  That's actually where I first saw some Mean Jeans work because I had a friend out there
[28:01.060 --> 28:07.020]  that we kind of shared a little patch one year and he, I guess, I guess he, he had gotten
[28:07.020 --> 28:12.740]  some seeds from you and he, we grew the, the root beer and we grew the, the PK and
[28:12.740 --> 28:16.660]  some of your cherry limes and it was like Urkel lime.
[28:16.660 --> 28:19.140]  I forget some other, and they were just beautiful.
[28:19.140 --> 28:23.460]  Just the Urkel lime was insane, especially in light of what you're talking about with
[28:23.460 --> 28:29.020]  the bag appeal, just like they were just these bulbous buds that just, just looked amazing
[28:29.020 --> 28:33.740]  and probably, probably the cherry lime out of everything was, was the favorite at the
[28:33.740 --> 28:36.180]  end of the year, just, just getting to smoke it.
[28:36.180 --> 28:41.060]  And you know, the, the root beers were a little later, but they just, when they, when they
[28:41.060 --> 28:46.860]  filled in, they were like just so terpy and, and, and enjoyable.
[28:46.860 --> 28:52.300]  And last year, your Humboldt dream was my, my buddy's biggest plants in the garden last
[28:52.300 --> 28:53.300]  year.
[28:53.300 --> 28:58.060]  He's got a picture of him just in the Anderson Valley with this plant that's just like gigantic,
[28:58.060 --> 28:59.060]  you know?
[28:59.060 --> 29:01.020]  So he's like, Oh, I'm doing this one every year now.
[29:01.020 --> 29:06.140]  So you guys, kudos to you guys for, you know, putting out the quality work.
[29:06.140 --> 29:09.620]  And I think, yeah, this year I'm going to, I'm going to probably pull out some of the
[29:09.620 --> 29:11.300]  other Malawi hybrids.
[29:11.300 --> 29:16.740]  Maybe I've seen a lot, a lot of buzz around the chocolate Malawi, which is one that, that
[29:16.740 --> 29:18.940]  I haven't been working with as much in the past.
[29:18.940 --> 29:20.540]  And so maybe pull that one out.
[29:20.540 --> 29:24.740]  I think that's probably one at the top of the list is the chocolate hashberry to the
[29:24.740 --> 29:26.820]  heirloom Malawi.
[29:26.820 --> 29:32.740]  And you know, the, the, the glue line is one I've been working for a little while is trying
[29:32.740 --> 29:40.320]  to find a reliable glue back cross and find a male out of that, that I can hit to things
[29:40.320 --> 29:46.140]  and get that, you know, chocolatey, gassy aroma and taste out of the hybrids that come
[29:46.140 --> 29:47.140]  through.
[29:47.140 --> 29:55.020]  And you know, maybe we're gonna pull out some, some crazy land races and try work with some,
[29:55.020 --> 30:00.020]  you know, some wild, some wild stuff and, you know, try to, try to see what, you know,
[30:00.020 --> 30:05.700]  what else we could put out there that, that is going to be unique.
[30:05.700 --> 30:08.580]  It's all about setting yourself apart in this industry.
[30:08.580 --> 30:13.420]  And yeah, like you were saying, maybe you find a cut that you don't want to share with
[30:13.420 --> 30:14.420]  people.
[30:14.420 --> 30:16.980]  And I would, I would love to hear that somebody found something out of my work that, that
[30:16.980 --> 30:22.500]  really worked well for them and they wanted to keep around for years and years and, and,
[30:22.500 --> 30:26.300]  and maybe it helped keep them afloat in, in tough times.
[30:26.300 --> 30:33.700]  And so, so certainly we're going to keep working for a mold resistance, which is, you know,
[30:33.700 --> 30:40.980]  even more of an issue nowadays with, you know, the testing requirements and you know, some
[30:40.980 --> 30:48.940]  of the other projects, you know, might, might include, you know, maybe, maybe some of the
[30:48.940 --> 30:55.580]  other Malawis or, you know, I've, I've kind of got a rough sketch, but, but we haven't,
[30:55.580 --> 30:57.620]  we haven't nailed anything down yet.
[30:57.620 --> 31:02.140]  You know, I think get back with the team and see what everybody else wants to do too.
[31:02.140 --> 31:08.540]  And you know, maybe go back and look at, because I try to, I try to catalog everything, all
[31:08.540 --> 31:12.740]  the, all the seeds, you know, everybody that gave me seeds today, we traded, I'm going
[31:12.740 --> 31:17.140]  to go and try to catalog and keep, keep a list of everything.
[31:17.140 --> 31:23.500]  And you know, you do that long enough and you're going to have a nice, nice collection.
[31:23.500 --> 31:30.740]  You know, I hope, I hope everybody starts getting into more of their own, like phenol
[31:30.740 --> 31:37.180]  hunts and, and finding things that do well in your local situation, which, you know,
[31:37.180 --> 31:41.540]  whatever property that you might have might be even totally different from your neighbor's
[31:41.540 --> 31:46.100]  parcel because they're on the other side of the ridge, you know, or, or maybe, maybe
[31:46.100 --> 31:50.460]  the people down the road or, you know, a little closer to a valley and they get more wind
[31:50.460 --> 32:00.860]  or, you know, so, so it's, it's great to be here and see, you know, all, all the different
[32:00.860 --> 32:05.820]  success stories from different strains, because that definitely has a big effect on my personal,
[32:05.820 --> 32:09.660]  you know, decisions of what I'm going to go and breed with is when I go and talk to the
[32:09.660 --> 32:14.780]  community or I go to, you know, the Emerald Cup or, you know, you know, see somebody out,
[32:14.780 --> 32:19.700]  you know, you know, in town or something and they say, Oh, well, you know, you're, you're,
[32:19.700 --> 32:24.500]  you know, sour orange or, you know, your, your granddaddy orange or, or, you know, maybe
[32:24.500 --> 32:28.500]  one of these, you know, dream queen glue or this or that, like did really well for me.
[32:28.500 --> 32:35.060]  And that's, I love, I love hearing everybody's stories of, of what they've done with my genetics
[32:35.060 --> 32:37.180]  and what, what they really liked.
[32:37.180 --> 32:42.500]  Just like, you know, I've got folks that rave about these two guys genetics that, that they've
[32:42.500 --> 32:43.940]  tried in previous years.
[32:43.940 --> 32:48.180]  So you know, just, yeah, keep the stories coming.
[32:48.180 --> 32:49.180]  So.
[32:49.180 --> 32:50.180]  Awesome.
[32:50.180 --> 32:58.140]  And you know what I like is that it's rare that most, most people in nowadays, what I
[32:58.140 --> 33:02.660]  learned the internet is where you talk shit so you can get recognition because otherwise
[33:02.660 --> 33:04.300]  you don't exist.
[33:04.540 --> 33:07.780]  Unless you're flapping your mouth, throwing rocks at someone else, you're not even real
[33:07.780 --> 33:12.100]  person and we're sitting here hanging out and you're talking about your experiences
[33:12.100 --> 33:15.900]  with jeans work back in the day and, and Nat's work with your boys stuff.
[33:15.900 --> 33:19.620]  And you know, it's just, it's just cool.
[33:19.620 --> 33:21.620]  Appreciate it.
[33:21.620 --> 33:22.620]  Thank you.
[33:22.620 --> 33:23.620]  Thank you.
[33:23.620 --> 33:24.620]  Thank you.
[33:24.620 --> 33:25.620]  Thank you.
[33:25.620 --> 33:26.620]  Thank you.
[33:26.620 --> 33:27.620]  Thank you.
[33:27.620 --> 33:28.620]  Thank you.
[33:28.620 --> 33:29.620]  Thank you.
[33:29.620 --> 33:30.620]  Thank you.
[33:30.620 --> 33:31.620]  Thank you.
[33:31.620 --> 33:32.620]  Thank you.
[33:32.620 --> 33:33.620]  Thank you.
