[00:01.020 --> 00:07.820]  And we are live. Happy Sunday everyone. Welcome to episode 26 of the James Loud
[00:07.820 --> 00:15.540]  show and your host Mr. James Loud. How's it going everyone? Thanks for tuning in.
[00:15.540 --> 00:19.620]  We got a real special guest this week. We got Romulan Genetics. So you guys are
[00:19.620 --> 00:25.860]  gonna hear a lot about the history of Romulan and what it takes to start a
[00:25.860 --> 00:28.380]  seed company up. I think there's a lot of good things that we're gonna go over
[00:28.580 --> 00:34.140]  especially for you guys that are new to the industry or new to the breeding game
[00:34.140 --> 00:37.620]  that are interested in potentially working towards starting a seed company.
[00:37.620 --> 00:43.420]  So thanks for coming on the show. Hey thanks for having me guys. I appreciate
[00:43.420 --> 00:47.460]  it. So yeah Jake's in an area that doesn't get that good a reception so
[00:47.460 --> 00:51.980]  we're not doing a live feed as far as video. He's gonna be audio only but yeah
[00:51.980 --> 00:56.140]  that's that's how we're doing it this week. And then we got Romulan Genetics
[00:56.140 --> 00:59.740]  and their amazing logo. So let's just start off talking about your logo before
[00:59.740 --> 01:05.540]  everything else. I think that's an interesting subject as far as you have
[01:05.540 --> 01:11.300]  a very Trekkie with Romulan the name and then you have a Klingon or not Klingon
[01:11.300 --> 01:16.460]  you have the Vulcan hands. Yeah I get a lot of shit from Star Trek fans
[01:16.460 --> 01:22.580]  for that. I definitely do. And you know I apologize to all of them. I try to. I'm not a
[01:22.580 --> 01:25.620]  Star Trek fan. I you know I grew up around it and everything but I just was
[01:25.620 --> 01:31.540]  never into it. I was more of a Star Wars kid. So when it came to decide to make a
[01:31.540 --> 01:35.460]  logo for my company I tried a couple things and was looking at him and going
[01:35.460 --> 01:38.540]  that's not right. And then it kind of popped in my head that because I'm a
[01:38.540 --> 01:42.060]  Marine Corps veteran I should do something with the Eagle Globe and anchor
[01:42.060 --> 01:46.460]  logo for the Marines. And I thought that would actually look really neat. I messed
[01:46.460 --> 01:50.460]  around with what I was gonna put in the middle to replace the actual EGA and
[01:50.460 --> 01:54.860]  ended up with that Vulcan hand symbol because it's recognizable to people who
[01:54.900 --> 02:02.620]  aren't Star Trek fans. And Romulan is kind of a lot of people might not even
[02:02.620 --> 02:07.900]  have a clue about the strain let alone the Romulan Star Trek thing. And so it
[02:07.900 --> 02:11.380]  was kind of a way to try to bring things together and not confuse people as much
[02:11.380 --> 02:18.180]  as possible. And I think I've only had a few dozen Star Trek fans over the years
[02:18.180 --> 02:22.140]  you know mention it but it's it's something that I frequently have people
[02:22.140 --> 02:27.780]  say something about. Totally. No I think it's cool man I like your logo I think
[02:27.780 --> 02:34.100]  it's very simple and straightforward and you know so going back in time let's
[02:34.100 --> 02:38.220]  talk about the history of Romulan starting out because I think everybody's
[02:38.220 --> 02:43.340]  curious about that. There's there's a lot of curious people out there we've heard
[02:43.340 --> 02:47.540]  stories throughout the ages about Romulan and you know I think your story
[02:47.540 --> 02:52.380]  is a great one and you know your history with Romulan and being a second
[02:52.380 --> 02:56.020]  generation I think that's that's even greater. So you want to take us back to
[02:56.020 --> 03:02.340]  the very beginning of Romulan the strain you know how old is it where did it
[03:02.340 --> 03:10.300]  originate let's go that far. So I'll kind of start with you know I was I have
[03:10.300 --> 03:14.220]  pretty clear memories and still have pictures and stuff of me being literally
[03:14.300 --> 03:18.300]  a toddler in my diaper crawling around in my dad's farm underneath this plant
[03:18.300 --> 03:25.820]  and it was it has such a unique smell to it that it burned into my memory I mean
[03:25.820 --> 03:29.160]  the smell of my dad's bongs this was kind of all he smoked and the smell of
[03:29.160 --> 03:35.940]  that plant and it was something I grew up around my whole life. As I started to
[03:35.940 --> 03:39.300]  get older I started to get more exposed to stuff you know they tried to hide
[03:39.300 --> 03:43.180]  things from me as a kid but by the time I was around eight or nine they knew I
[03:43.180 --> 03:46.660]  knew everything and so I was kind of allowed around the group and allowed as
[03:46.660 --> 03:54.700]  part of the conversation and everything that that I grew up around it was not
[03:54.700 --> 03:58.860]  something that was made by one person it was a group of people it was my dad and
[03:58.860 --> 04:05.980]  his friends probably a lot of people were already working on this for for
[04:05.980 --> 04:09.540]  years before he got involved and I don't know exactly when he got involved I
[04:09.540 --> 04:13.220]  didn't get that part of the story very clear and my dad has since passed away
[04:13.220 --> 04:19.140]  so it's not really something I can talk to him about anymore but what I gathered
[04:19.140 --> 04:23.180]  was from stories and from hearing hearing people talking was that at some
[04:23.180 --> 04:26.860]  point after the Korean War there were Canadian War veterans that brought home
[04:26.860 --> 04:31.180]  seeds and they started growing it somewhere up in Canada and it sounded to
[04:31.180 --> 04:38.420]  me more more likely the Vancouver area you know the islands there and over time
[04:39.420 --> 04:46.860]  they had a lot of trouble growing it it was Thai seeds and at some point my
[04:46.860 --> 04:51.140]  father and his friends got involved and at that point my dad was we literally
[04:51.140 --> 04:56.660]  had planes flying over our property from Mexico kicking out bills of marijuana he
[04:56.660 --> 05:01.900]  and his buddy Clyde were the ones who from what I gathered I don't know if
[05:01.900 --> 05:08.140]  this is you know kind of for certain but they were the ones who introduced the
[05:08.140 --> 05:13.420]  Mexican sativa into it and then they ended up crossing it to Colombian and
[05:13.420 --> 05:17.820]  then they ended up crossing it to an indica an Afghani that kind of showed up
[05:17.820 --> 05:21.060]  on the scene at the time and they didn't like what happened to it back crossed
[05:21.060 --> 05:26.020]  at Colombian and ended up with what they liked but it wasn't really so much that
[05:26.020 --> 05:30.820]  it was my dad doing it it was this huge group of people from where we lived near
[05:30.820 --> 05:36.860]  Southern California going all the way up into Canada and there were two or three
[05:36.860 --> 05:40.980]  times a year family trips that we would take from when I was a baby where we
[05:40.980 --> 05:44.820]  would go all the way up to the border of Canada almost or into Oregon somewhere
[05:44.820 --> 05:48.780]  and we'd be camping off in the middle of the woods and there would be 40 or 50
[05:48.780 --> 05:53.500]  people that were all part of this group and and bunch of bikers bunch of
[05:53.500 --> 05:56.860]  veterans and you know skinny-dipping and all the stuff that happened in the 70s
[05:56.860 --> 06:06.060]  and that's what I grew up around and pops knew my dad knew that I was always
[06:06.060 --> 06:09.740]  really into cannabis I mean when I was a kid I was reading high times magazines
[06:09.740 --> 06:14.460]  and secretly got a subscription come into the house until he figured that out
[06:14.460 --> 06:18.740]  he knew I was really into it and I went off and joined the Marine Corps and did
[06:18.740 --> 06:22.820]  other things and he had this plan the whole time I didn't know kind of behind
[06:22.820 --> 06:26.420]  my back that I'm gonna keep this plan alive and give it to him one day and
[06:26.420 --> 06:31.580]  when he passed away his buddy Clyde got it into my hands and he got a bunch of
[06:31.580 --> 06:35.540]  old seeds into my hands and he said look this is it's your job now to keep this
[06:35.540 --> 06:40.300]  alive this is what your dad is leaving you and there were some issues that
[06:40.300 --> 06:44.900]  happened with my family and my my stepmother where I this was literally
[06:44.900 --> 06:48.420]  all I got I was supposed to get a bunch of things with my dad's the only thing I
[06:48.420 --> 06:53.100]  ended up getting was this plant these seeds and I had done some growing and
[06:53.100 --> 06:57.180]  some stuff myself when I was younger but nothing really my own it was always like
[06:57.180 --> 07:01.460]  at a friend's house and helping the friend and so that was kind of the real
[07:01.620 --> 07:06.940]  first time that I got to do my own grow from beginning to end and and control it
[07:06.940 --> 07:13.060]  all myself and it just it took off you know I ended up giving cuts to friends
[07:13.060 --> 07:17.380]  and giving some flour to people and people said holy crap you you you got to
[07:17.380 --> 07:22.660]  get this out there this is people need this and and that's what kind of started
[07:22.660 --> 07:30.060]  this whole thing yeah it's a pretty amazing start man I think you know we
[07:30.060 --> 07:33.700]  all fall into the cannabis industry one way or another and we all have great
[07:33.700 --> 07:39.500]  stories and that's definitely one for the books you know Romulan came to the
[07:39.500 --> 07:45.780]  Bay Area as far as I'm sure it's been around a lot longer but I saw Romulan in
[07:45.780 --> 07:52.100]  the Bay Area late 90s early 2000s my friend was selling clones of it to the
[07:52.100 --> 07:58.140]  dispensaries at the time the third floor some of the places in San Francisco he
[07:58.140 --> 08:01.180]  actually took the Romulan crossed it to the shaman and then back crossed it the
[08:01.180 --> 08:06.140]  wrong the the shaman again and he released those as the shaman and it was
[08:06.140 --> 08:11.420]  one of the best best strains back then it was just ultra and so we got that
[08:11.420 --> 08:15.500]  Romulan it's so unique it's like to this day if I smell Romulan I recognize it
[08:15.500 --> 08:18.740]  and I'm sure you know most people are like that if you've really experienced
[08:18.740 --> 08:21.900]  good Romulan you know it and you can smell it it's just like other strains
[08:21.900 --> 08:26.220]  like cat piss skunk all these things Romulan stands out just like those
[08:26.220 --> 08:32.340]  varieties so yeah it's one of my favorites it's another one of those
[08:32.340 --> 08:38.780]  that's hands-down is just it gets you high super high the effects are great
[08:38.780 --> 08:41.860]  but also the structure it's one of those ones that you could tell that it was
[08:41.860 --> 08:46.740]  worked properly and the structure is solid on it you know the the calyx and
[08:46.740 --> 08:51.580]  the way it stacks it grows fairly well especially in the indoor environment
[08:51.580 --> 08:55.060]  I've never grown it outdoors so I can't speak for that but I've assumed that it
[08:55.060 --> 09:01.740]  grows really well outdoor as well yeah so I've been following you and your
[09:01.740 --> 09:06.580]  your profile from the beginning where you before you started making feminized
[09:06.580 --> 09:10.780]  seeds I think I hit you up a long time ago and you were kind of asking me about
[09:10.780 --> 09:13.780]  you you hit me up and asking some questions about some stuff about
[09:13.780 --> 09:17.620]  feminized seeds and I was really curious about the Romulan story and you had sent
[09:17.620 --> 09:22.980]  me an email with the whole history and I was I was impressed by everything this
[09:22.980 --> 09:28.180]  is long before my show too and then you figured out on your own how to do the
[09:28.180 --> 09:33.780]  feminized seeds and you know I think your Instagram is probably one of the
[09:33.780 --> 09:40.300]  better for smaller seed companies so I guess walk us through the beginning of
[09:40.300 --> 09:46.940]  Romulan genetics and your seed making process over the last however long yeah
[09:46.940 --> 09:51.300]  so like I was saying with my little story a minute ago there's you know it
[09:51.300 --> 09:54.780]  started with me giving cuts away to friends and kind of local people around
[09:54.780 --> 09:58.700]  me you know saying look this is and I knew some some growers have been doing
[09:58.700 --> 10:03.740]  it for a long time and had some older mentors that were growers and and once I
[10:03.740 --> 10:06.700]  kind of gave it to them and one form or another you know whether it was flower
[10:06.700 --> 10:10.340]  or a clone they look you got to get this out there do you mind if I give it to
[10:10.340 --> 10:13.740]  more people and I said no no and I mean that's kind of like my responsibility
[10:13.740 --> 10:17.740]  now is to keep this thing alive and I suppose the more people I give it to the
[10:17.740 --> 10:23.220]  better you know so it started with that and I ended up gifting my clone to dark
[10:23.220 --> 10:27.140]  heart nursery and I thought you know well this is a big company and they're
[10:27.140 --> 10:31.540]  gonna get it out there and it I didn't realize how much went into them
[10:31.540 --> 10:36.940]  processing it testing it and doing all the things they do prior to release and
[10:36.940 --> 10:41.060]  it took about a year and a half almost two years before they actually released
[10:41.060 --> 10:45.540]  it from the moment I got it into their hands so when I got into their hands I
[10:45.540 --> 10:48.500]  kind of had this imagination thing going this fantasy that you know it's
[10:48.500 --> 10:52.140]  gonna take a few months and they're gonna they're gonna spread these clones
[10:52.140 --> 10:55.780]  out everywhere and that didn't happen and I kept contacting him and pestering
[10:55.780 --> 10:59.020]  him and you know when you guys gonna release it and I could tell I was being
[10:59.020 --> 11:03.940]  a pain in their ass I just from conversation with friends and stuff it
[11:03.940 --> 11:08.100]  just became apparent to me that I have to do more than just giving the clones
[11:08.100 --> 11:11.860]  away and someone said well you know you've been kind of messing around with
[11:11.860 --> 11:15.900]  breeding some things already why don't you make seeds of Romulan and I said
[11:15.900 --> 11:20.500]  well you know I have these old seeds that I would have to if I want to make
[11:20.500 --> 11:23.980]  regulars I have to hunt through those and I don't really feel you know the
[11:23.980 --> 11:27.860]  most confident about trying to hunt through Romulan yet and someone said
[11:27.860 --> 11:31.980]  well why don't you make feminized seeds and I said okay so I started that
[11:31.980 --> 11:37.260]  process of feminized seeds first and it was not going well and so I ended up
[11:37.260 --> 11:41.900]  getting into the old regular seeds that I had finding a male and I made the
[11:41.900 --> 11:46.860]  regular seeds first actually and going through that process gave me a little
[11:46.860 --> 11:51.860]  more confidence about getting back into the feminized seeds and I tried that
[11:51.860 --> 11:56.180]  again and the first couple times I tried it I wasn't spraying it enough or I you
[11:56.180 --> 12:01.100]  know the first time I tried a home mixture where I bought powdered silver
[12:01.100 --> 12:04.460]  thiosulfate and some other things and used to scale to mix them together and I
[12:04.460 --> 12:07.980]  could tell I didn't have the right equipment to do it right but I gave it a
[12:07.980 --> 12:11.980]  shot anyway it didn't work and the second time I tried it I didn't spray it
[12:11.980 --> 12:15.700]  enough I don't think I was using a product that I bought off a company it
[12:15.700 --> 12:21.700]  took four or five attempts to get it reversed and it got to a point where I
[12:21.700 --> 12:24.980]  was getting really frustrated and I gave it to some friends and had them trying
[12:24.980 --> 12:28.620]  to reverse it people who had already made feminized seeds and they're calling
[12:28.620 --> 12:32.140]  me saying this things a pain in the ass to flip I don't I don't know why it's
[12:32.140 --> 12:41.980]  not working and eventually I came down to using the STS and colloidal silver
[12:41.980 --> 12:46.860]  both the first time I did it I kind of used a combination of the two different
[12:46.860 --> 12:51.820]  reversal sprays you can use and that worked and I mean I sprayed it every
[12:51.820 --> 12:55.500]  single day top to bottom and just doused it and I finally had a plant that flipped
[12:55.500 --> 13:00.740]  properly and it was pretty exciting to finally get that to happen after and it
[13:00.740 --> 13:09.860]  was maybe a year I'm trying to do it and it was uh it was not easy it took a
[13:09.860 --> 13:15.980]  lot of research and a lot of learning and if at the time I hadn't had found
[13:15.980 --> 13:19.700]  places on forums like I see mag comm and stuff I don't think I really would have
[13:19.700 --> 13:23.500]  been able to figure it out on my own but there was a lot of people that I was
[13:23.500 --> 13:27.300]  able to get access to and talk to and bounce ideas off of and like you and I
[13:27.300 --> 13:31.100]  emailed each other and I was kind of you know I was able to finally put
[13:31.100 --> 13:37.180]  things together and do it but it was it was definitely a big process not not an
[13:37.180 --> 13:41.100]  easy thing to do from what I've heard from a lot of people it's it was mainly
[13:41.100 --> 13:45.580]  because my Romulan is a little more difficult than other strains to reverse
[13:45.580 --> 13:51.500]  yeah for sure I think the more stable the variety is the more sexually stable
[13:51.500 --> 13:57.780]  and as far as I see the more homozygous the strain is the harder is to reverse
[13:57.780 --> 14:01.540]  that's for sure and so I mean but that's a good thing especially if you can
[14:01.540 --> 14:05.020]  figure out how to reverse it you know I think a lot of people would have given
[14:05.020 --> 14:09.420]  up and then just said fuck it and and crossed it with something and then tried
[14:09.420 --> 14:12.860]  to reverse something easier there's so many other approaches but uh it's
[14:12.860 --> 14:17.580]  interesting that you took the long route to get that done and then so what were
[14:17.580 --> 14:21.220]  your first crosses that you made with it you selfed it obviously you did those
[14:21.220 --> 14:26.980]  s1 releases yeah what else did you do in the beginning as far as varieties so
[14:26.980 --> 14:32.660]  the first first thing I actually started making is as breeding on my own and this
[14:32.660 --> 14:36.220]  was long before I even knew I was gonna do Romulan genetics I started making
[14:36.220 --> 14:42.260]  what ended up was my ring of fire release and that was I thought okay if
[14:42.260 --> 14:47.140]  I'm gonna get into this and this is just kind of my personality the way I do
[14:47.300 --> 14:51.940]  things I thought I I'm not I don't want to just start by crossing two plants
[14:51.940 --> 14:55.500]  together that seems too simple and straightforward and I don't feel like
[14:55.500 --> 14:59.740]  I'm gonna learn enough there so I'm gonna start with what I at that point
[14:59.740 --> 15:02.980]  had been reading as might be the hardest thing for me to do and that's to make a
[15:02.980 --> 15:09.500]  polyhybrid from scratch so that was what I first did and I was I was crossing
[15:09.500 --> 15:15.740]  these things together and and it ended up becoming a double polyhybrid so it
[15:15.820 --> 15:18.500]  got way more bigger than I kind of thought it was gonna be but I was just
[15:18.500 --> 15:22.540]  having a lot of fun with it that was the actual first thing that I really made
[15:22.540 --> 15:25.760]  and then the second thing I made was the regular seeds of Romulan and that was
[15:25.760 --> 15:29.860]  the first real release that I did then I made the feminized seeds and I released
[15:29.860 --> 15:38.580]  those and then after that I did a feminine I see drop I had been kind of
[15:38.580 --> 15:42.260]  messing around when I made the double polyhybrid I would some other things and
[15:42.260 --> 15:46.300]  crossing plants that weren't Romulan together to see what they did and how
[15:46.300 --> 15:49.700]  they worked with each other and just kind of experimenting all over the place
[15:49.700 --> 15:54.340]  but I had some things that I had made that were pretty decent and one of them
[15:54.340 --> 16:01.340]  was a Durban poison and grape stomper and I crossed that with Romulan and made
[16:01.340 --> 16:06.460]  what I called communion and that was just fabulous and it was one of the best
[16:06.460 --> 16:11.060]  things I still feel like one of the best things I've made I made that and then I
[16:11.060 --> 16:19.820]  made stromulon and if I had the list in front of me I'd be able to to list them
[16:19.820 --> 16:24.140]  all off right now but I made like five or six different feminized stuff and I
[16:24.140 --> 16:30.340]  was gonna drop them over the course of like a year and just kind of got some
[16:30.340 --> 16:34.540]  wild thing up me and someone said why don't you just release them all on 420
[16:34.540 --> 16:39.180]  and I gave that a shot I had been selling some seeds prior to this but it
[16:39.260 --> 16:43.660]  was real slow and you know all through email and when I did the release on on
[16:43.660 --> 16:48.340]  420 it was a year or two ago and they all sold out in like almost 48 hours and
[16:48.340 --> 16:51.980]  it was madness trying to deal with processing that because I wasn't used to it
[16:51.980 --> 16:56.140]  trying to get everything packaged up and shipped but that was where things really
[16:56.140 --> 16:59.740]  kind of took off because I started getting seed banks and started getting
[16:59.740 --> 17:03.100]  contact from a bunch of people about doing collaborations and working with
[17:03.100 --> 17:10.300]  them and I went from you know being who I felt like I'm just completely nobody
[17:10.300 --> 17:13.380]  and no one should pay attention to me and I'm getting emails from gauge green
[17:13.380 --> 17:16.940]  group and ethos and all these people that I'm looking up to as being these
[17:16.940 --> 17:22.460]  huge companies that are really pulling it off and so it was nice it gave me
[17:22.460 --> 17:25.900]  some confidence to keep going on it and there were a lot of points where I I
[17:25.900 --> 17:29.660]  thought you know I don't I don't think I have what it takes to do this I'm not
[17:29.660 --> 17:32.820]  good enough I don't know enough so many other people have been doing this for 20
[17:32.820 --> 17:37.180]  years and it's probably not even right that I'm selling seeds when I still
[17:37.180 --> 17:44.500]  don't quite know what I'm doing but I'm really happy with with what I'm doing
[17:44.500 --> 17:50.460]  now and happy with how things are going it's it went from being what felt like a
[17:50.460 --> 17:57.460]  responsibility and almost a burden at first to now it's it's my whole life
[17:57.460 --> 18:04.700]  it's it's everything I'm passionate about everything that's awesome yeah the
[18:04.700 --> 18:11.380]  one thing I think you did right where a lot of people they go wrong especially
[18:11.380 --> 18:16.900]  in the beginning is you you had a good starting point with with Romulan I mean
[18:16.900 --> 18:20.780]  you had something that's stable something that passes on really good
[18:20.780 --> 18:26.420]  quality traits and you know that there can't be enough said about picking
[18:26.420 --> 18:30.300]  picking the right plants for breeding you know it's like exactly just because
[18:30.300 --> 18:33.220]  you put two things together and you made seeds doesn't mean they're gonna be good
[18:33.220 --> 18:37.540]  seeds just because you put two amazing varieties together doesn't mean they're
[18:37.540 --> 18:41.260]  super compatible and they're gonna give you a good you know your progeny you're
[18:41.260 --> 18:46.780]  not you're not always gonna get that and so it's amazing with what what you can
[18:46.780 --> 18:50.380]  do with one good parent and and something like Romulan and you know
[18:50.380 --> 18:52.980]  besides the name factor you know you could put it with so many different
[18:52.980 --> 18:56.820]  things and there's plays on words and all kinds of stuff but as far as like
[18:56.820 --> 19:00.220]  compatibility I think it goes with a lot of different varieties because it's a
[19:00.220 --> 19:05.700]  you know a hybrid that's kind of in the middle you know in it and exactly yeah
[19:05.700 --> 19:14.180]  it's it's an interesting one for sure so as far as you're in Northern California
[19:14.180 --> 19:21.580]  ish right like yeah I'm I'm in El Dorado County so near Grass Valley just south
[19:21.580 --> 19:28.980]  of Humboldt, Minnesota. Nice you do you do any outdoor as well with it? I do I
[19:28.980 --> 19:36.500]  don't get to as much as I'd like I've got a really small property and the
[19:36.500 --> 19:43.020]  neighbors right next door to me are law enforcement so I you know and they know
[19:43.020 --> 19:46.220]  what I do but I try to be polite about it I don't want to be skunking out their
[19:46.220 --> 19:51.060]  property with a bunch of plants outdoors but I do do stuff outdoors I've got some
[19:51.060 --> 19:54.780]  people who live locally that I can do I have a little bit more freedom on their
[19:54.780 --> 19:59.340]  property and they let me do some some grows there so I've grown most of the
[19:59.340 --> 20:02.060]  stuff except for the newer things I've grown most of the stuff I've made
[20:02.060 --> 20:09.740]  outdoors and Romulan is something that it's almost better outdoors than it is
[20:09.740 --> 20:14.700]  indoors it you know you get much higher quality kind of top-shelf bud when you
[20:14.700 --> 20:19.740]  grow it indoors obviously it's prettier and a little bit more potent but the
[20:19.740 --> 20:24.540]  outdoor stuff is just as a plant it just seems to thrive more outdoors it
[20:24.540 --> 20:30.540]  looks healthier looks it's just easier to keep happier outdoors and it it's an
[20:30.540 --> 20:37.820]  amazing plant outdoor I was shocked that the the rake seeds that the initial rake
[20:37.820 --> 20:41.540]  seeds that I made how well those turned out for outdoor and when I tested them
[20:41.540 --> 20:45.180]  indoor I thought oh you know I think I did a pretty good job here but I don't
[20:45.180 --> 20:51.180]  know if these are gonna be good outdoor and I had I think his name's Rex from
[20:51.180 --> 20:55.540]  straight organics he's a pretty well-known guy he got a hold of some of
[20:55.540 --> 20:59.460]  my rake seeds and grew it outdoor and posted a video up online and and I
[20:59.460 --> 21:04.500]  could not believe how well of a grow that he did and how good it looked you
[21:04.500 --> 21:08.900]  know just huge massive plant nice fade on it just filled with trichrome
[21:08.900 --> 21:15.100]  carburetor that's also yeah yeah it's been one of the one of the most
[21:15.100 --> 21:19.020]  enjoyable things for me is seeing other people grow my work and seeing them
[21:19.020 --> 21:25.420]  enjoy growing it and enjoy smoking it it's it's such a I don't know it it
[21:25.420 --> 21:31.100]  makes everything worth it when I see people happy all the hard work totally
[21:31.100 --> 21:35.540]  yeah and it doesn't seem like work at that point you know it's like it's a
[21:35.540 --> 21:41.980]  lifestyle yep exactly that's every day I get up I tend to my gardens and it's
[21:41.980 --> 21:46.980]  what keeps me going what makes me happy yeah friends that are like how can we
[21:46.980 --> 21:51.340]  never leave your house and I'm like I got plants man I got I got stuff to do
[21:51.340 --> 21:58.300]  yeah it's tough taking a vacation when you got a 70-day cycle mm-hmm yeah I
[21:58.300 --> 22:01.900]  wouldn't even have been able to take one at all if I hadn't built my new room
[22:01.900 --> 22:07.980]  with everything automated I finally got everything irrigation where it's I can
[22:07.980 --> 22:10.940]  walk away from this place for three or four days and I know it's gonna be okay
[22:10.940 --> 22:15.100]  and in the past I've always been hand watering and doing it all getting in
[22:15.100 --> 22:20.940]  there you know so it's nice to finally have a little bit of freedom just a tiny
[22:20.940 --> 22:27.220]  bit yeah we were talking the other day about a light spectrum and reversals and
[22:28.020 --> 22:32.020]  yeah because I just built the automated room as well that basically has troll
[22:32.020 --> 22:37.060]  master aqua X and hydro X and it basically will do everything for you but
[22:37.060 --> 22:41.300]  it's LED so I have to do my reversal under HPS because I struggle with the
[22:41.300 --> 22:46.940]  LEDs and you were encountering some similar issues with reversals yeah when
[22:46.940 --> 22:52.460]  I when I started everything I was using you know metal highlight in HPS and and
[22:52.460 --> 22:57.820]  then I had a little room that I built with a CMH light and and that was
[22:57.820 --> 23:03.460]  fantastic but my issue with all of my grow rooms and I had like I said more
[23:03.460 --> 23:06.780]  flexibility with locals around me and friends that I could use their property
[23:06.780 --> 23:14.220]  and Kovac really just shut all of that down and I happen to be planning to at
[23:14.220 --> 23:18.060]  the time to be building a larger room for myself for breeding and so it kind
[23:18.060 --> 23:22.440]  of worked out for me that I was already going down that road but once Kovac kind
[23:22.440 --> 23:27.680]  of shut down me being able to use other properties I went from using the HPS and
[23:27.680 --> 23:32.080]  the CMH lights and I got a lot of LED lights and I started seeing a lot of
[23:32.080 --> 23:35.480]  problems with the reversals and stuff that I was trying to do and I had this I
[23:35.480 --> 23:40.000]  had these plants that I've been I put so much work into and I was so excited
[23:40.000 --> 23:43.440]  about dusting them with the reverse Romulan and I was gonna do a new
[23:43.440 --> 23:49.920]  feminized seed batch and and it didn't flip and I ended up getting I mean it
[23:50.000 --> 23:54.480]  put another plant in and sprayed that last minute and by that point the ones
[23:54.480 --> 23:58.620]  that were trying to get pollinated were already at week four and so that's a
[23:58.620 --> 24:02.760]  nightmare but I ended up getting about a hundred seeds total so I had enough to
[24:02.760 --> 24:07.440]  where I could see what things were gonna turn out to be but I didn't have enough
[24:07.440 --> 24:11.120]  to give any to anybody and it was really upsetting because some of the stuff that
[24:11.120 --> 24:15.920]  I grew as testers I haven't ever shown anyone pictures of it it was fantastic
[24:15.920 --> 24:21.840]  and I fucked up because I didn't have a whole lot of space and I prioritized
[24:21.840 --> 24:25.920]  Romulan clones and they're the ones that I keep alive no matter what and so when
[24:25.920 --> 24:30.040]  I was doing that pollination I thought well I'm gonna throw everything in here
[24:30.040 --> 24:35.160]  and I'm just not gonna keep clones I'm just this is gonna be a one-off and so I
[24:35.160 --> 24:39.600]  can't do it again there's you know I could hunt through for some of them and
[24:39.600 --> 24:43.600]  try to find something similar but it the stuff that I had it was just exactly
[24:43.720 --> 24:47.520]  what I wanted and everything was going perfect until the reversal process and
[24:47.520 --> 24:52.880]  and it took me a while before I realized it's my new LED lights you know and I
[24:52.880 --> 24:58.160]  tried a short while later I did a reversal thing and I was had to plant
[24:58.160 --> 25:01.360]  outdoor for the most part and I was kind of light definite taking inside and put
[25:01.360 --> 25:05.880]  in the shed at night and it reversed just fine and you know and that was
[25:05.880 --> 25:09.040]  where I realized okay it's these LED lights because I didn't have a problem
[25:09.040 --> 25:13.720]  before with the other stuff and and so now all the LED lights I have ones that
[25:13.720 --> 25:19.800]  have additional far red and more of a red spectrum nice I haven't done a
[25:19.800 --> 25:24.000]  reversal yet with these new lights we'll see if it's gonna make a difference
[25:24.000 --> 25:28.720]  cross your fingers yeah I don't know if I'm gonna be brave enough to just keep
[25:28.720 --> 25:31.760]  it in there I'll probably have it out in the sunshine and probably be getting it
[25:31.760 --> 25:36.240]  you know as much blue and red light as I possibly can yeah I'm all about
[25:36.240 --> 25:40.440]  redundancies too so collecting pollen in advance like that's just been a game
[25:40.440 --> 25:43.760]  changer like because I've had times where I reverse stuff and I've done a
[25:43.760 --> 25:47.280]  bunch of reversals over the years and still I have problems every once in a
[25:47.280 --> 25:52.080]  while so having backup pollen is always a great thing yeah you when you and I
[25:52.080 --> 25:54.480]  talked the other day about that I realized that's something I need to get
[25:54.480 --> 25:57.800]  back into I had done that a lot in the past I had especially with making
[25:57.800 --> 26:02.040]  rake seed stuff I always had this mason jar filled with pollen because I'd leave
[26:02.040 --> 26:05.200]  the mail in there and then when I would take him out you know around week two or
[26:05.200 --> 26:08.480]  three or whatever when I was taking him out and then I would collect all the
[26:08.480 --> 26:13.000]  pollen off him and use a harvest more you know trim bin and just kind of shake
[26:13.000 --> 26:16.160]  the mail out over that make sure it was clean inside and then it falls through
[26:16.160 --> 26:19.960]  the seed and I could collect all the pollen that way really easily and I used
[26:19.960 --> 26:23.960]  to always have some kept in my fridge mixed with flour and in a jar and in
[26:23.960 --> 26:28.440]  that way when I got done with a lot of stuff that I've done I would have the
[26:28.440 --> 26:32.360]  you know same mail same pollen but he would get done and I'd pull him out and
[26:32.360 --> 26:35.280]  be getting ready to take his pollen off him and I would take what I had left
[26:35.280 --> 26:39.120]  over in the jar and you know put that in front of the fan and take a paintbrush
[26:39.120 --> 26:42.080]  and dust some of the plants with a paintbrush and do that just to make sure
[26:42.080 --> 26:49.240]  I'm getting as much as I possibly can here that's awesome yeah I mean that's
[26:49.240 --> 26:54.080]  the thing is like those redundancies like if you do have a shitty reversal or
[26:54.080 --> 26:58.840]  if you have just a you know the reversals okay but then the pods don't
[26:58.840 --> 27:03.640]  open up and there's so many factors you know it's like there really are most
[27:03.640 --> 27:08.280]  people don't realize how you know they kind of they maybe have dusted something
[27:08.280 --> 27:11.200]  or they had a herm and got seeds and they kind of think that well you know if
[27:11.200 --> 27:14.680]  the mails in there you're gonna get thousands of seeds and it's it's just
[27:14.680 --> 27:18.240]  not the case every time it might happen the first 12 times like that just
[27:18.240 --> 27:21.880]  perfect everything's pollinated and then one time you go in there and it's
[27:21.880 --> 27:26.480]  there's nothing and you have to kind of figure out what happened and you know I
[27:26.520 --> 27:29.840]  had one pollination go really poorly because I let the humidity get too high
[27:29.840 --> 27:33.320]  and the pollen just wasn't viable it was floating around in the air getting
[27:33.320 --> 27:37.200]  moisture on it I realized that mistake and you know there's a lot of different
[27:37.200 --> 27:42.080]  things that you kind of you come into some strains are just hard to pollinate
[27:42.080 --> 27:46.080]  you know mac one is a pain in the ass you can't reverse it you can't really it
[27:46.080 --> 27:49.560]  doesn't make many seeds even if you don't there have been several things
[27:49.560 --> 27:53.600]  that I've seen like that where they just they're almost sterile they're not quite
[27:53.680 --> 27:57.280]  but they're they're almost there well yeah and then cookies everything
[27:57.280 --> 28:01.280]  reverses you look at cookies man it's like a all the cookie stuff it's not
[28:01.280 --> 28:07.280]  super sexually stable and so it flips easy yeah a couple sprays and it's
[28:07.280 --> 28:11.360]  already shown yeah I mean I heard there's a new spray out that's like one
[28:11.360 --> 28:16.040]  and done you spray the day you flip and it's like some super concentrated STS I'm
[28:16.040 --> 28:22.440]  I'm not a big fan I mean I think concentrated STS is good but the one and
[28:22.440 --> 28:25.640]  done I see my one of my friends tried it and burn the shit out of his plants
[28:25.640 --> 28:31.160]  yeah that's the problem when you mix it too hot it's I mean you're putting
[28:31.160 --> 28:34.440]  diluted chemicals is what you're supposed to be putting on it and if
[28:34.440 --> 28:38.240]  you're putting you know much more undiluted chemicals it's gonna burn
[28:38.240 --> 28:45.520]  stuff yeah for sure yeah so you use a traditional recipe with like STS and
[28:45.520 --> 28:50.100]  silver nitrate or is it a straight STS and then colloidal silver like whenever
[28:50.100 --> 28:54.540]  I'm reversing the Romulan clump cut that I have I usually do both to ensure
[28:54.540 --> 28:59.060]  that I'm gonna get it to flip because it is a bit of a pain in the ass I've got
[28:59.060 --> 29:05.020]  it now to flip from just one both ways yeah but it's a lot more work if I use
[29:05.020 --> 29:09.060]  both I can and I'm kind of confusing him in my head right now but one of them is
[29:09.060 --> 29:12.100]  you got to spray like every four or five days and the other one you can spray
[29:12.100 --> 29:17.060]  like once or twice and I just kind of stick to both schedules you know I spray
[29:17.060 --> 29:20.100]  it with the silver colloidal and then I spray it with the other one and I just
[29:20.100 --> 29:24.300]  kind of do both at the same time and I never seem to have a problem when I do
[29:24.300 --> 29:29.940]  that yeah that's but when I'm flipping when I'm flipping other things it's not
[29:29.940 --> 29:34.700]  it's not nearly as difficult I've been working on a few other things I've been
[29:34.700 --> 29:37.620]  kind of I've been telling people for a long time I'm not gonna do feminized
[29:37.620 --> 29:40.940]  seeds but I've been secretly doing some stuff in the background with it right
[29:40.940 --> 29:44.060]  and I've been one of the things that I thought about was you know a lot of the
[29:44.060 --> 29:47.340]  times when I do reversals well all the times I've done so far I've reversed the
[29:47.340 --> 29:51.860]  Romulan and let it dust other things and so I know how great Romulan is as a
[29:51.860 --> 29:56.180]  female plant and I've learned a little bit more how male and females interact
[29:56.180 --> 29:59.540]  with each other when you breed with them and so I'm really interested to see what
[29:59.540 --> 30:03.740]  it's gonna be like when I'm picking specific other strains to reverse and
[30:03.740 --> 30:09.860]  pollinate my Romulan as a female I feel like that's gonna it's gonna come out
[30:09.860 --> 30:14.940]  not necessarily as interesting because the Romulan is gonna I think gonna
[30:14.940 --> 30:21.700]  over dominate a lot of the crosses that I do but I'm gonna get a lot more potent
[30:21.700 --> 30:27.860]  and washable and squishable stuff which is gonna be good for some people nice
[30:27.860 --> 30:31.940]  yeah so what are you looking for let's talk about what you look for in breeding
[30:31.940 --> 30:35.900]  parents on both sides like a receiver and donor as far as something to cross
[30:35.900 --> 30:41.260]  since you specialize in the Romulan what what would you say are good
[30:41.260 --> 30:45.980]  compatible plants that that add value to the Romulan that don't take away from it
[30:45.980 --> 30:53.180]  the whenever I'm breeding the first thing I always the number one factor is
[30:53.180 --> 30:59.340]  the ease of grow for the plant if something is easy for an average grower
[30:59.340 --> 31:03.300]  to pull off decently then that's something that I that I'm gonna work
[31:03.380 --> 31:07.500]  with because a lot of the people that grow my stuff I mean I have a lot of big
[31:07.500 --> 31:11.940]  commercial cultivators and huge massive facilities in Canada and across the
[31:11.940 --> 31:14.940]  country that grow my gear but I also have a lot of people that just have a
[31:14.940 --> 31:20.780]  tent and they're not they're growing as a hobby they're not into this for you
[31:20.780 --> 31:23.980]  know a business or to make money or anything they're just growing for their
[31:23.980 --> 31:28.100]  own head stash and a lot of them have jobs and other things to do and kids so
[31:28.100 --> 31:32.900]  they can't devote all the time to it like some of us can and when you breed
[31:32.900 --> 31:36.740]  with stuff that's difficult to grow that it's just they can't pull off a
[31:36.740 --> 31:41.460]  proper harvest and I don't like that I like handing people something that they
[31:41.460 --> 31:44.620]  can put it in the ground and if they give it just soil they can feed it
[31:44.620 --> 31:47.860]  probably just water the whole time and they'll still get a pretty decent smoke
[31:47.860 --> 31:51.060]  at the end all right even if they're not growing under great lights and
[31:51.060 --> 31:55.620]  everything else so that's the first thing to me is I'll be looking at is
[31:56.020 --> 32:02.980]  this plant an easy grow is it finicky does it is it resistant to pests you
[32:02.980 --> 32:07.700]  know so when those things fall into place then it's all about the effects I
[32:07.700 --> 32:12.020]  don't care as much about taste unless it's nasty to smoke you know if it's
[32:12.020 --> 32:14.940]  something that's just kind of gross and disgusting to me the flavor or the
[32:14.940 --> 32:19.460]  terpenes I probably won't work with it but if it's I don't really care too much
[32:19.460 --> 32:24.580]  about the taste that's all secondary stuff it's about the effects so if one
[32:24.580 --> 32:27.940]  if it makes you feel high from smoking it that's that's obviously clearly
[32:27.940 --> 32:33.340]  important but to me there's a lot of factors that aside from feeling
[32:33.340 --> 32:39.260]  medicated does it make me feel anxious does it make my heart race does it give
[32:39.260 --> 32:44.860]  me anxiety does it increase my mental issues that I deal with daily does it
[32:44.860 --> 32:49.100]  you know increase my depression or my insomnia does it bring out PTSD if it
[32:49.100 --> 32:53.900]  has any negative side effects other than dry mouth and munchies I probably won't
[32:53.900 --> 32:57.060]  mess with it if it gives you a headache from smoking too much I won't mess with
[32:57.060 --> 33:05.420]  it so I'm really focused on for my own personal consumption of it you know it's
[33:05.420 --> 33:09.340]  it everything that I release is something that I enjoy smoking and
[33:09.340 --> 33:13.140]  that's that's kind of first and foremost for me and I give it to other people my
[33:13.140 --> 33:16.100]  friends I haven't come over and they smoke it and I say do you like that and
[33:16.100 --> 33:20.620]  and if they say yeah that's that's that's fantastic then I know other
[33:20.620 --> 33:24.700]  people are gonna like it and I can release it but when it comes down to
[33:24.700 --> 33:28.500]  selecting plants it's it starts with is it easy to grow and then it goes to you
[33:28.500 --> 33:33.500]  know does it affect you properly does it give you what you want and then there's
[33:33.500 --> 33:38.420]  there's the the other important thing so once I know that this cultivar is a good
[33:38.420 --> 33:43.380]  smoke and it's an easy to grow then I look at structure I want things that are
[33:43.380 --> 33:48.520]  easier to trim because Romulan is so tricone covered that it's just a
[33:48.520 --> 33:52.720]  nightmare to trim on its own it has a pretty good leaf to calyx ratio it's not
[33:52.720 --> 33:57.440]  that bad but the trim itself I mean you got to have like five pairs of scissors
[33:57.440 --> 34:00.160]  and you got to have a bunch of jars with alcohol because you're gonna be changing
[34:00.160 --> 34:06.000]  scissors like every you know three gram bud pretty much and so I like to try to
[34:06.000 --> 34:13.280]  breed with things that are gonna help with that if possible and I look for
[34:13.280 --> 34:17.920]  yield if something is a real crappy yield you know no matter how good it is
[34:17.920 --> 34:22.720]  unless it's just absolutely phenomenal smoke I probably won't release it and
[34:22.720 --> 34:28.080]  I've I've had I mean I've got this huge collection I've probably released close
[34:28.080 --> 34:32.640]  to a third of what I've made most of the stuff that I make it I'm so picky about
[34:32.640 --> 34:37.400]  it no no I'm not gonna release this it's not good enough and there's only a few
[34:37.400 --> 34:41.520]  things that I've been really on the line with and Ring of Fire was one of them I
[34:41.680 --> 34:46.400]  wasn't sure if I should release that because it's a double polyhybrid it's
[34:46.400 --> 34:50.460]  made from a lot of land race old stuff that I didn't have a lot of knowledge on
[34:50.460 --> 34:54.440]  other than this is Hawaiian seeds or you know this is this and it literally would
[34:54.440 --> 34:59.640]  just say a country name on it now that was all I had so I really wasn't sure
[34:59.640 --> 35:03.920]  about releasing that and I tested it tested it several times and it was just
[35:03.920 --> 35:07.960]  really tentative about it but everyone that I've heard from that has grown it
[35:07.960 --> 35:15.360]  has just loved it absolutely loved it and so it's been a huge boost to my
[35:15.360 --> 35:18.600]  confidence my ego and everything else that that was one of the things that I
[35:18.600 --> 35:24.360]  was really like I think the first time I dropped that I gave it away the second
[35:24.360 --> 35:29.800]  time I did I like a limited 10-pack released a few people and then finally I
[35:29.800 --> 35:33.600]  was like yeah okay those people like it so far and then I released the feminized
[35:33.760 --> 35:41.560]  version that I had of it and people love it and that to me is it's a it's
[35:41.560 --> 35:45.440]  difficult when you have something that you're not sure about that you know you
[35:45.440 --> 35:50.560]  like the smoke but it's a little finicky to grow and or maybe the you know it's
[35:50.560 --> 35:53.760]  not as homogenous as you want it to be the plants are you know phenotypes are
[35:53.760 --> 35:59.840]  kind of all over the place it's difficult to release something that I
[35:59.840 --> 36:04.200]  don't feel 100% about but when I hear back from people that there's nothing
[36:04.200 --> 36:08.480]  negative there's no bad feedback about it it kind of helps me move forward a
[36:08.480 --> 36:13.080]  little bit more in that area totally cannabis is so subjective so from one
[36:13.080 --> 36:17.400]  person to the next and one breeder to the next there's so much diversity and
[36:17.400 --> 36:22.120]  because so many people buy seeds and don't germinate them too so I would guess
[36:22.120 --> 36:27.000]  that probably 75% of the seeds sold out there get put away in some drawer I mean
[36:27.000 --> 36:30.520]  I know I have a collection of seeds you have a collection of seeds we've all got
[36:30.520 --> 36:34.320]  collections of seeds but it's amazing how many people don't germinate any they
[36:34.320 --> 36:38.760]  just collect seeds yeah that when I when I found that out it was probably a
[36:38.760 --> 36:42.560]  couple years ago that I realized that was going on there was this big
[36:42.560 --> 36:46.600]  collector market well you know almost like their Pokemon cards or something
[36:46.600 --> 36:51.080]  that people were just basically buying seeds up to collect them and that really
[36:51.080 --> 36:55.520]  kind of shocked me because I everything that I buy is right if I've got it it's
[36:55.520 --> 36:58.640]  because I'm gonna grow it at some point I might not get to it yet but at some
[36:58.640 --> 37:03.080]  point I've got plans I'm gonna grow that and I remember kind of getting a little
[37:03.080 --> 37:07.400]  upset when I first learned about that because I noticed I've this isn't the
[37:07.400 --> 37:10.920]  first business that I've run I've run several businesses before this and I
[37:10.920 --> 37:14.560]  know for a fact if I hadn't run businesses before this I wouldn't know
[37:14.560 --> 37:18.120]  what the hell I'm doing there's a lot of this you don't realize is very
[37:18.120 --> 37:27.760]  business-sided but I sorry I lost track of my thought there that's okay we're
[37:27.760 --> 37:35.080]  talking about collecting seeds yeah and so I got a little upset because I saw
[37:35.080 --> 37:38.480]  from the business standpoint that there's a lot of seed banks out there
[37:38.480 --> 37:42.400]  and a lot of breeders that are taking advantage of the collectors I mean
[37:42.400 --> 37:46.840]  they're really kind of playing on the hype factor of it and making fancy
[37:46.840 --> 37:52.600]  packaging and making things that specifically look collectible and I
[37:52.600 --> 37:57.520]  remember that kind of upset me a little bit I had a little a little internal
[37:57.520 --> 38:00.600]  thing to go through with that when I first realized that there was seed
[38:00.600 --> 38:04.560]  collectors that had no intention of ever growing and then there were companies
[38:04.560 --> 38:08.580]  out there that were specifically marketing to those people really high
[38:08.580 --> 38:15.200]  priced seed packs but right I get it you know it's it's an industry it's tough
[38:15.200 --> 38:18.360]  well you know there's a million seed guy not a million but there's thousands
[38:18.360 --> 38:22.320]  of seed companies out there now people you know targeting people and they have
[38:22.320 --> 38:27.160]  great names for their crosses and then they have they claim they have really
[38:27.160 --> 38:31.120]  good you know rare genetics that they're working and it's really tough unless you
[38:31.120 --> 38:36.160]  you know them personally or you have some way to verify if they have the real
[38:36.160 --> 38:39.560]  cut because it's just like there's Romulan out there then there's the real
[38:39.560 --> 38:43.480]  Romulan you know right like so many other things you know wedding cake
[38:43.480 --> 38:47.280]  there's lots of different wedding cake cuts and people aren't specific with
[38:47.280 --> 38:52.160]  which wedding cake they're crossing you know is it the JBC which wedding cake
[38:52.160 --> 38:56.680]  are you crossing yours too because they all are slightly different and some of
[38:56.680 --> 39:00.680]  them are garbage yeah I mean there's some companies I'm not gonna name any
[39:00.680 --> 39:05.960]  names but they've made millions of dollars off of mediocre genetics yeah I
[39:05.960 --> 39:10.320]  think in these things happen in every industry you know where there's money
[39:10.400 --> 39:15.640]  there's gonna be snake oil you know and mm-hmm you know there's always room for
[39:15.640 --> 39:23.200]  mids unfortunately yeah yeah and that's it you know I'm because I grew up around
[39:23.200 --> 39:27.880]  this and and have literally spent my whole life around cannabis one way or
[39:27.880 --> 39:35.160]  another with some minor exceptions it's important to me that this is done right
[39:35.160 --> 39:40.120]  you know not just from my standpoint but from everyone's standpoint and I as
[39:40.120 --> 39:44.040]  much as I don't like seeing companies do that that you know are just kind of
[39:44.040 --> 39:47.640]  throwing things together and not really doing proper work I get that that's just
[39:47.640 --> 39:53.560]  something that's it's a necessary evil and has to be out there and you know the
[39:53.560 --> 39:57.360]  the bright side of that is for all these people making all these crosses with so
[39:57.360 --> 40:01.500]  many similar clone cuts and stuff that is the same name that is a totally
[40:01.500 --> 40:08.020]  different cut there are gems popping out of that you know not extensive
[40:08.020 --> 40:11.300]  breeding work that they're doing you know they may just be thrown a reversal
[40:11.300 --> 40:15.140]  in and pollinate and all these you know plants and that's not really extensive
[40:15.140 --> 40:20.060]  work that's not you know deep selection that's not phenol hunting but there are
[40:20.060 --> 40:26.220]  still great cultivars popping out of that work and so it it's just kind of
[40:26.220 --> 40:30.380]  something we have to deal with and I feel like over time it's gonna you know
[40:30.380 --> 40:36.300]  probably get worse but at the same time if there's good that comes from it it's
[40:36.300 --> 40:40.180]  something we can all live with I think I think with the way things are going in
[40:40.180 --> 40:43.580]  cannabis it's gonna it already is pretty much this way but it's gonna be a lot
[40:43.580 --> 40:47.700]  more like music you know a lot more like walking into a record store and you know
[40:47.700 --> 40:51.180]  you like country and hip-hop or whatever it is and so you go to those sections
[40:51.180 --> 40:56.020]  and that's where you choose what you want and cannabis because there's just
[40:56.020 --> 41:00.100]  so many people out making so many things and a lot of them doing almost the same
[41:00.100 --> 41:04.660]  cross it gets to be more like this is the you know this breeder is the
[41:04.660 --> 41:11.460]  musician that I like and and you you find people that you know you kind of he
[41:11.460 --> 41:15.740]  thinks the same way you do when it comes to what you want to smoke and I think
[41:15.740 --> 41:18.780]  that's kind of where things are going and if you look around you see that you
[41:18.780 --> 41:21.820]  see a lot of people that they find two or three breeders and that's who they
[41:21.820 --> 41:28.140]  stick with yeah what once I found that you know it's it's very big very much
[41:28.140 --> 41:32.100]  based on reputation I don't do a ton of advertising but I have a ton of repeat
[41:32.100 --> 41:36.220]  buyers because once people buy your stuff then they'll come back if they
[41:36.220 --> 41:39.980]  like it they'll come back and get more of it yep very much like the music
[41:39.980 --> 41:44.780]  industry yeah like all these problems we ever gonna work themselves out but
[41:44.780 --> 41:49.260]  there's also the other problem is is people's standards are pretty low and a
[41:49.260 --> 41:55.140]  lot of people don't grow amazing cannabis so whatever they grow it's not
[41:55.140 --> 41:59.340]  gonna matter that when I'm not saying a lot of people I guess there there are a
[41:59.340 --> 42:04.140]  handful of people that grow absolutely amazing cannabis just like everything
[42:04.140 --> 42:09.380]  else is that 1% but if you don't know how to grow really well you're not gonna
[42:09.380 --> 42:15.020]  be able to make that plant express what it should you know I think that's part
[42:15.020 --> 42:19.660]  of it too and and people were starting to learn better cultivation techniques I
[42:19.660 --> 42:22.700]  think the information is out there so if you want to grow good cannabis the
[42:22.700 --> 42:28.020]  information is out there you the seeds are available and you know it's it's
[42:28.020 --> 42:33.540]  amazing how much more information is out there now compared to like 15 years ago
[42:33.540 --> 42:39.780]  yeah yeah it really is I mean it's I know I know that even 15 years ago we
[42:39.780 --> 42:42.980]  had forums and there was a lot of good information but you had to kind of be in
[42:42.980 --> 42:47.300]  certain circles to even know about those forums first of all and yeah you know
[42:47.300 --> 42:51.300]  back then all we had was books and magazines and if you knew someone you
[42:51.300 --> 42:55.140]  could talk to them but that was about the extent of it and now I mean you can
[42:55.140 --> 42:59.140]  you can Google stuff you can you know I mean you can just be on Instagram and
[42:59.140 --> 43:03.540]  asking people questions and you can learn so much from that should I spend
[43:03.540 --> 43:06.940]  probably half the time that I spend on social media is answering people's
[43:06.940 --> 43:11.620]  questions about growing and things like that trying to help them out yeah you
[43:11.620 --> 43:14.820]  know and I think there was a lot of misinformation back in the day and now
[43:14.820 --> 43:18.660]  we're getting you know we're crop steering information on crop steering is
[43:18.660 --> 43:22.300]  readily available you know I mean we weren't we've only been talking about
[43:22.300 --> 43:27.940]  crop steering for a couple years but it's like you know pushing terpenes and
[43:27.940 --> 43:32.980]  cannabinoids it's like pretty amazing what we'll be able to do in the future I
[43:32.980 --> 43:38.620]  think so because everything up until now has been observational and anecdotal you
[43:38.620 --> 43:42.620]  know and that kind of varies from grower to grower they might have the same exact
[43:42.620 --> 43:46.300]  cut but one guy's gonna have a little bit different outcome and tell you how
[43:46.300 --> 43:51.100]  he got it dialed in this way and the other guy got it dialed in this way but
[43:51.100 --> 43:57.940]  now that we're gonna have you know this large volume of data to go off of before
[43:57.940 --> 44:03.860]  too long of real scientific data we'll be able to actually have things
[44:03.860 --> 44:07.820]  completely dialed into the way that they want them and it won't it won't take
[44:07.820 --> 44:12.980]  that 20 years of grower experience to where you can look at a plant and go
[44:12.980 --> 44:18.140]  she's happy you know totally well and I think there's also this fear of people
[44:18.140 --> 44:22.060]  that are like how am I gonna compete with the big guys and these big
[44:22.060 --> 44:27.620]  companies and it's like well the truth is if you grow amazing cannabis if you're
[44:27.620 --> 44:30.780]  in that 1% it doesn't matter what industry or what you do if you're in
[44:30.780 --> 44:35.260]  that 1% you're gonna be successful and cannabis is no different you know it's
[44:35.260 --> 44:38.420]  like the guys that grow the fire if you're growing the fire five years from
[44:38.420 --> 44:42.380]  now you're still gonna have success the small companies you know I can name a
[44:42.380 --> 44:45.740]  whole bunch of smaller companies that aren't the big companies and they're
[44:45.740 --> 44:50.500]  they're gonna be successful you know I see collective fig farm in the Bay Area
[44:50.500 --> 44:54.020]  you know guys like those guys they're doing real craft cannabis and they're
[44:54.020 --> 44:58.900]  gonna keep doing craft cannabis and this is in the metric I mean you know talking
[44:58.900 --> 45:01.940]  about traditional you know you just got to grow amazing stuff because the price
[45:01.940 --> 45:07.980]  is gonna keep dropping and dropping the way I see it so you know it's like make
[45:07.980 --> 45:12.660]  sure you know own your craft and hone your craft yeah and and I think if
[45:12.660 --> 45:15.660]  you're if you're passionate about it that's just kind of something that's
[45:15.660 --> 45:20.660]  gonna come naturally right yeah over time you're just gonna force yourself to
[45:20.660 --> 45:24.220]  get better and learn more and you know there are a lot of growers out there
[45:24.220 --> 45:28.500]  that it's not that they don't necessarily have that passion and maybe
[45:28.500 --> 45:34.100]  it's they don't have the time or or the the tools to to excel and progress
[45:34.100 --> 45:39.180]  forward with it but I think for people that are really into it you know it
[45:39.180 --> 45:42.460]  that's that's what becomes apparent before too long you're looking at your
[45:42.460 --> 45:45.420]  grow and looking at other people's stuff and going mine's not adding up how do I
[45:45.420 --> 45:50.180]  make it better and yeah over time over time you do get better and once you get
[45:50.180 --> 45:53.420]  to where you're growing good quality cannabis it doesn't matter who you are
[45:53.420 --> 45:58.060]  how small you are how big you are you're gonna be able to be successful at it
[45:58.060 --> 46:01.580]  because you're gonna find customers that don't want to turn anywhere else they
[46:01.580 --> 46:05.540]  know they can rely on quality and they'll get it from me every time yeah
[46:05.540 --> 46:10.220]  for sure established brand names is where it's at you know and then people
[46:10.220 --> 46:15.940]  not selling out yeah and you know there's a point where people do sell out
[46:15.940 --> 46:20.340]  I mean I think people need to have exit plans with their businesses yeah see
[46:20.340 --> 46:23.940]  it's a fun stuff in the chat but you know it's like you know you got to have
[46:23.940 --> 46:28.540]  an exit strategy with your business no matter what it is you know some people
[46:28.540 --> 46:31.580]  you know it's like I want to do this forever but it doesn't necessarily mean
[46:31.580 --> 46:36.460]  that my company is not going to be sold so I can do some other thing in cannabis
[46:36.460 --> 46:41.460]  or start another company I mean there's so many different things exactly yeah
[46:41.460 --> 46:45.880]  you know if you look around closely you notice that there's a lot of breeders
[46:45.880 --> 46:49.260]  out there that have already branched out that in the past maybe all they did was
[46:49.260 --> 46:52.340]  breeding but now they've got a nutrient company or now they've got a soil
[46:52.340 --> 46:58.220]  company and some of it it's not necessarily obvious you know like Ed
[46:58.220 --> 47:02.140]  Rosenthal's a great example the guy's been an amazing author forever but now
[47:02.140 --> 47:06.300]  he's got some you know other great companies that are industry related you
[47:06.300 --> 47:09.820]  know making nutrients and making fertilizers and making pesticides and
[47:09.820 --> 47:14.500]  things like that it's a character so he came on my show I learned something
[47:14.500 --> 47:20.180]  about running shows and guests and all that stuff I had so mom I show a while
[47:20.180 --> 47:24.740]  back and I had Ed as the guest special guest and I surprised some with Ed and
[47:24.740 --> 47:28.660]  it turned out to be a shit show so if you guys were watching I apologize again
[47:28.660 --> 47:34.700]  you know I feel like each guest needs their own 15 minutes to share their
[47:34.700 --> 47:38.980]  story and sometimes personalities even though Soma and Ed are great friends and
[47:38.980 --> 47:42.580]  I've been great friends with both of them we've hung out and had great times
[47:42.580 --> 47:47.820]  it was kind of a shit show on my show but yeah Ed's a character for sure
[47:47.940 --> 47:54.100]  mm-hmm yeah I got invited over to his house a couple years ago to smoke with
[47:54.100 --> 47:59.260]  him and it never actually happened but I practically pissed myself when I when I
[47:59.260 --> 48:03.980]  heard it I couldn't believe that yeah since I was a little kid I've looked up
[48:03.980 --> 48:08.380]  to I mean I really was I was like eight years old reading high times magazines
[48:08.380 --> 48:12.420]  and you know paying attention to what what was going on in the cannabis cup
[48:12.420 --> 48:17.260]  and it was just from a little kid very young age I thought I want to do this
[48:17.260 --> 48:22.620]  one day I want to make my own cannabis plant and I want to I want to have other
[48:22.620 --> 48:26.860]  people try it smoke it and I want to go to a cannabis cup and try all these
[48:26.860 --> 48:32.460]  different strains and I laugh because of where I'm at today you know the kid back
[48:32.460 --> 48:36.140]  then most kids wanted to become an astronaut or something else and and this
[48:36.140 --> 48:41.900]  is what I wanted to do yeah for you younger guys out there you know I'm 44
[48:41.900 --> 48:46.580]  right now it's like when I was 18 I wanted to grow weed and yeah grow and
[48:46.580 --> 48:50.540]  sell weed is what I wanted to do when I was 18 I've done a lot of other stuff
[48:50.540 --> 48:55.860]  between but it's like looking back my 18 year old self would be proud of me for
[48:55.860 --> 49:01.700]  doing what I'm doing right so you can do it and you know it's like stick to your
[49:01.700 --> 49:04.860]  guns be passionate about what you do I think those are the most important
[49:04.860 --> 49:07.300]  things is be passionate about it if you're not passionate about it anymore
[49:07.300 --> 49:13.020]  there's a million other things you can do yeah start a nutrient company yeah
[49:13.020 --> 49:19.060]  yeah yeah I'd say I've I've had some some family members and stuff that I've
[49:19.060 --> 49:22.540]  talked to about you know and they oh how do I get into doing that and I just kind
[49:22.540 --> 49:28.180]  of bluntly have said you don't you don't you not even a grower you can't just
[49:28.180 --> 49:31.980]  hear my story and think well I'm just gonna get in and I'm gonna do that so
[49:31.980 --> 49:36.500]  many have you have to find yeah I know I know and it's it's okay but you know I
[49:36.500 --> 49:39.500]  was trying to give them the best advice I could and I said you have to find what
[49:39.500 --> 49:43.340]  you really care about and don't start with well I really care about money
[49:43.340 --> 49:47.260]  because that it just doesn't work no matter how you think it's going it might
[49:47.260 --> 49:50.860]  work for a while but eventually you'll find yourself doing something else and
[49:50.860 --> 49:55.460]  that's how that's how my life's gone gone forever you know and I've seen so
[49:55.460 --> 49:58.380]  many people like that they get into well you know I'm gonna be an uber driver now
[49:58.380 --> 50:01.500]  because I can make easy money and six months later they're not an uber driver
[50:01.500 --> 50:07.460]  because it wasn't easy money so you know I try to try to keep it realistic for
[50:07.460 --> 50:10.620]  people and I told you know I had one family member I said well if you really
[50:10.620 --> 50:14.660]  want to work in the cannabis industry because you don't grow because you're
[50:14.660 --> 50:19.500]  inexperienced start by trying to get a job as a bud tender or a trimmer start
[50:19.500 --> 50:23.620]  there because that is that's the ground level and once you get more experience
[50:23.620 --> 50:28.580]  and kind of understand how things work then you can do whatever it is that you
[50:28.580 --> 50:32.700]  feel passionate about and if that is breeding once you kind of have a general
[50:32.700 --> 50:37.380]  knowledge of cannabis then you can get into that but you don't even want to
[50:37.380 --> 50:41.900]  think about breeding if you haven't smoked for a long time and smoked a lot
[50:41.900 --> 50:45.300]  of strains because you won't have the background knowledge of even where to
[50:45.300 --> 50:51.780]  begin I think totally so yeah Matt right is trying to get us back on task you're
[50:51.780 --> 50:58.820]  talking about breeding how you doing Matt so yeah let's uh let's go back into
[50:58.820 --> 51:03.860]  so you know I feel like we've covered a lot of history but you know as far as
[51:03.860 --> 51:09.380]  like here's a great question for you what is your ratio of donors to
[51:09.380 --> 51:17.340]  receivers in your rooms so is it strain dependent so sometimes you know you use
[51:17.340 --> 51:24.020]  more donors or or less donors or I mean I would say that your experience with
[51:24.020 --> 51:30.180]  the Romulan did it reverse as well so you probably don't need it nearly as
[51:30.180 --> 51:37.060]  much as if you were to reverse something else right I'm not entirely familiar
[51:37.060 --> 51:42.100]  with the nomenclature donor and okay so like if you're gonna reverse the plant
[51:42.100 --> 51:48.060]  how many I know we're laughing at right now it's all good man let's let's say
[51:48.060 --> 51:51.980]  you take a you take your Romulan and you put it on a bunch of other plants how
[51:52.020 --> 51:58.660]  many what would the ratio be one to six one to six plants one to nine plants you
[51:58.660 --> 52:04.020]  know everybody I pretty much never work with more than five plants that I'm
[52:04.020 --> 52:08.220]  pollinating at once five different cultivars I would say yeah because it'll
[52:08.220 --> 52:14.780]  be it might be more than five plants but I because I'm very anal throughout the
[52:14.780 --> 52:18.740]  whole process I go in there every single day check every plant top to bottom
[52:18.820 --> 52:22.500]  because of early lessons I learned that you may have a cut that you've grown a
[52:22.500 --> 52:25.980]  few times and this time it gets stressed and it throws a herm somewhere and if it
[52:25.980 --> 52:31.180]  throws one herm your whole seed batch is now tainted and you don't know what's
[52:31.180 --> 52:36.020]  gonna be in there for certain so I get in and I check every single plant and
[52:36.020 --> 52:40.020]  since the beginning of doing that I've thought well if I have so many different
[52:40.020 --> 52:44.980]  cultivars or so many different cuts it makes this way more of a pain in the ass
[52:44.980 --> 52:54.900]  yeah so generally I'm doing two to four most time and sometimes I do five five
[52:54.900 --> 52:59.380]  varieties how about the last the last two rake seed batches I did I did five
[52:59.380 --> 53:03.900]  different cultivars in the same room getting pollinated with a Romulan male
[53:03.900 --> 53:08.940]  do you just use one male for your entire room then or do you have multiple males
[53:08.940 --> 53:14.180]  sometimes a couple times I've done two or three meals the exact same cut
[53:14.180 --> 53:18.180]  typically it's just one I grow the male big enough and but the one time I did I
[53:18.180 --> 53:22.100]  had a had smaller males they weren't quite caught up yet and so I just threw
[53:22.100 --> 53:27.300]  a couple of them in there to make sure I'd get enough pollen nice I think who
[53:27.300 --> 53:32.340]  was it said a green machine I never read with more than two plants period that
[53:32.340 --> 53:36.580]  keeps the selection process streamlined that's great you know there's nothing
[53:36.580 --> 53:41.900]  wrong with that I think that's good for you whatever works for you do that you
[53:41.900 --> 53:46.220]  know if you're successful that's great I have a yeah exactly I have a very
[53:46.220 --> 53:51.780]  limited space that I can read in yeah I'm not you know I don't have big rooms
[53:51.780 --> 53:55.980]  big greenhouses I don't it's I mean my property is tiny if you saw it you
[53:55.980 --> 54:01.460]  probably shit yourself I have a very limited space and a lot of the stuff
[54:01.460 --> 54:05.180]  that I create doesn't get released so if I just did two at a time I might not
[54:05.180 --> 54:09.140]  have anything to release from that batch that might that might mean I not might
[54:09.140 --> 54:13.620]  not release something new for two years and I just did that recently where I
[54:13.620 --> 54:17.260]  didn't release anything new for almost a year and my followers were kind of
[54:17.260 --> 54:21.020]  freaking out about it you know what are you gonna drop something new what it's
[54:21.020 --> 54:24.660]  going on you know or did you stop breeding and you know it's no I'm just
[54:24.660 --> 54:29.300]  I'm working on stuff I'm taking my time and that was when I kind of dropped all
[54:29.300 --> 54:33.020]  those feminized at once and I was thinking I'm gonna drop them and several
[54:33.020 --> 54:37.220]  batches throughout the next year and because they all sold out I didn't have
[54:37.220 --> 54:40.820]  anything so as people were gone you know hit me up what seeds can I buy and
[54:40.820 --> 54:44.180]  if I don't I don't really have anything right now I have this one cultivar
[54:44.180 --> 54:49.740]  available and that's it so that's why I have to kind of do things a little bit
[54:49.740 --> 54:54.060]  more diverse that's the minimum I will do is two but I usually am doing trying
[54:54.060 --> 54:59.900]  to do three or four of something because I'll put my testers out and grow them and
[54:59.900 --> 55:04.660]  lately the testers have been looking better and better and things have been
[55:04.820 --> 55:08.500]  you know where it's I'm only finding one or two that I don't want to drop and
[55:08.500 --> 55:13.420]  don't want to release but if I did things that way it would be it wouldn't
[55:13.420 --> 55:17.740]  be good for my customers people who try to keep coming back and you know I have
[55:17.740 --> 55:23.500]  guys in Australia and places in Russia and all over the world that I ship seeds
[55:23.500 --> 55:27.060]  to and they keep coming back over and over again for their next crop and I
[55:27.060 --> 55:31.780]  kind of feel like I should have at least something available for them yeah it's
[55:31.820 --> 55:34.820]  tough people think that you just make seeds and you release them but there's a
[55:34.820 --> 55:39.020]  there's a lot of process if you're doing it the right way as far as testing
[55:39.020 --> 55:41.820]  everything depending on how many you're testing everybody has different
[55:41.820 --> 55:47.020]  environments so mm-hmm some people do stress testing I stress test my stuff
[55:47.020 --> 55:54.260]  now yeah that's I do as extreme stress stress testing as I can and that's kind
[55:54.260 --> 55:57.660]  of been my thing all along as you know I get a lot of people say wow you know your
[55:57.660 --> 56:01.260]  photos look great and they don't really quite catch on to the fact that I've
[56:01.260 --> 56:04.140]  been I've been saying this the whole time too is that everything that I show
[56:04.140 --> 56:08.980]  of people for a release that's a stress test crop and I'm trying to show people
[56:08.980 --> 56:15.180]  the worst result you'll get not the best because I feel like if you see this and
[56:15.180 --> 56:18.820]  you think that looks fantastic I want to grow that and when you grow it if you
[56:18.820 --> 56:22.820]  show me and I keep getting this from growers they how come I look so much
[56:22.820 --> 56:26.140]  better than yours they're showing me these pictures you know and stacking you
[56:26.140 --> 56:29.780]  know really great yield going on and and I said well because you're growing it
[56:29.780 --> 56:33.220]  right and whenever I've shown people pictures prior to release I'm showing
[56:33.220 --> 56:38.300]  them my stress test crop and I do everything from light changes throughout
[56:38.300 --> 56:42.980]  the process over under watering and a lot of people don't believe that I do
[56:42.980 --> 56:47.620]  this but I intentionally introduce rustic mites spider mites thrips aphids
[56:47.620 --> 56:54.820]  I try to do what everyone else is going to encounter if things don't go well
[56:54.820 --> 57:01.740]  Rosenthal's girl unintentionally but yeah it's funny cuz uh yeah there's a
[57:01.740 --> 57:05.820]  there's a saying under promise over over deliver that that's exactly what that is
[57:05.820 --> 57:09.620]  you know so many people that over promise and under deliver you know it's
[57:09.620 --> 57:15.060]  it's great to have people that are try at least trying to you know give people
[57:15.060 --> 57:18.300]  something that they're gonna get better results than they see so your Instagram
[57:18.300 --> 57:21.660]  let's talk about that your Instagram has gone up quite a bit you know over the
[57:21.660 --> 57:25.220]  years and I think you have a lot of followers a lot of people liking your
[57:25.220 --> 57:31.900]  stuff and a lot of people commenting and I mean I attribute that to your photos I
[57:31.900 --> 57:35.220]  mean there's there's probably a lot with your hands-on communication with
[57:35.220 --> 57:39.260]  everybody too but man your photos are great so do you have tips for how you do
[57:39.260 --> 57:44.820]  your photos in your rooms yeah so I don't know if I I mean I certainly have
[57:44.820 --> 57:49.300]  a little bit more of a leg up in that department than others my grandfather
[57:49.300 --> 57:54.140]  was a professional photographer and created a lot of patents for photography
[57:54.140 --> 57:57.740]  when he was younger and he taught me how to take pictures with a you know real
[57:57.740 --> 58:03.580]  old-school camera when I was about five I had my first camera and one of my ex
[58:03.580 --> 58:09.300]  wife's was I helped her through photography school you know a college
[58:09.300 --> 58:13.780]  level photography school and was there you know every photo shoot and so I
[58:13.780 --> 58:18.180]  picked up all kinds of things about studio photography that I wouldn't have
[58:18.180 --> 58:22.060]  had a single clue about with lighting and things like that so I did have a bit
[58:22.060 --> 58:26.180]  of a leg up in that area but I still when I got into it for cannabis I really
[58:26.180 --> 58:29.780]  was uncomfortable didn't really know what I was doing didn't consider myself
[58:29.780 --> 58:33.580]  to be a photographer and wasn't really taking any pictures of anything hadn't
[58:33.580 --> 58:39.540]  been for years so it was a almost two separate arms of what I'm doing was
[58:39.540 --> 58:43.700]  learning how to be a grower and a breeder and then trying to learn how to
[58:43.700 --> 58:50.700]  be a photographer and take good pictures of these and I can remember you
[58:50.700 --> 58:55.740]  know years ago seeing photos from professor P and dynasty genetics and
[58:55.740 --> 59:00.020]  just thinking crushes that's that's that's that's how you do it if you're
[59:00.020 --> 59:04.540]  gonna do this you have to be able to show people what it looks like when
[59:04.540 --> 59:08.140]  you're standing in front of it not some cell phone or crappy shot or something
[59:08.140 --> 59:12.640]  that's out of focus you have to be able to show you know as true to life as you
[59:12.640 --> 59:17.520]  can get with it in the plant and and and be able to grow it really well and I
[59:17.520 --> 59:21.880]  mean that guy just does it better that I think than just about anyone else grows
[59:21.880 --> 59:24.960]  the plant amazingly and then he takes just the most beautiful pictures of it
[59:24.960 --> 59:28.800]  and when I saw that I thought that's what I want to get to I want to aim for
[59:28.800 --> 59:33.680]  that I don't want to aim for anything lower than that and I know I am nowhere
[59:33.680 --> 59:40.880]  near that but I'm getting better and better and that's been a frustrating
[59:40.880 --> 59:44.120]  learning process you know like growing you might make a mistake or two but
[59:44.120 --> 59:47.200]  photography there's stuff that I'll run into or I don't know what I'm doing
[59:47.200 --> 59:51.520]  wrong and I research and look stuff up and I can't figure it out and then one
[59:51.520 --> 59:55.320]  day I'll do something different and go oh my god that's what I was doing okay
[59:55.320 --> 01:00:01.000]  now I know how to do that and it's been a long drawn-out process but it turns
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:06.680]  out that I it's something that I almost love as much as is growing it's I really
[01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:12.600]  I'll spend hours looking at my pictures before I post them up on Instagram I
[01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:16.480]  mean just like I'm sitting here drooling over photos that I oh god that looks so
[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:21.040]  good yeah and I post the picture up and I get like 100 likes and no one comments
[01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:25.400]  and I'm like heartbroken this was my favorite photo and then I post this
[01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:28.320]  other picture up that I don't give a shit about it just it was a snap and I
[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:33.280]  didn't really put any effort into it and people love it so you're using you're
[01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:37.680]  using an actual camera and not your camera phone like 99% of the guys out
[01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:44.000]  there yeah so I started with a fairly cheap entry-level Canon EOS Rebel camera
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:48.920]  and it was like a 10 megapixel or 12 megapixel camera and so all of my early
[01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:52.920]  photos were with that there was a couple early photos with cell phone but then I
[01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:59.360]  bought a 5ds which is a 50 megapixel and so I can take a shot like a you know a
[01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:02.920]  headshot of a bud so it's got the apical colon you don't really see many of the
[01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:07.160]  secondaries but from that you know three five three to five feet away photo
[01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:11.760]  I can zoom in on it and get all the way up to where you see the trichome heads
[01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:17.080]  really clearly and big and it looks like a macro photo and so that's been a huge
[01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:21.720]  help that I've got this really high resolution camera and I've gone out and
[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:27.440]  bought some really nice lenses to go with it and but I've got a full studio
[01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:32.280]  setup that I don't have it permanently set up like that I used to have a
[01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:35.840]  side shed that I had it set up permanently as my photo studio but now I
[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:39.080]  just kind of shut my kitchen down and I put up this huge backdrop and I've got a
[01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:43.240]  bunch of standing lights on their own tripods and I do a lot of different
[01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:48.600]  things but one of the things that I do that I showed a Bob from cats who seeds
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:52.640]  he was he came up to my house and we hung out and he specifically wanted me
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:56.280]  to show him how to take better pictures and he said what's your trick with
[01:01:56.280 --> 01:02:00.640]  lighting and I said well I have all this stuff and this is nice and you can buy
[01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:03.920]  it and do the same thing I'm doing but the other thing you can do is just get
[01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:07.680]  find a backdrop somewhere whether it's your white wall on your house or you
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:11.880]  throw down a black towel behind something and grab a flashlight open up
[01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:15.120]  your shutter and take an extended shutter shot and paint the mud with your
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:19.520]  flashlight and I showed him how I did it and he just couldn't believe it and I
[01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:23.160]  showed him the picture and he went oh my god that's just so easy and it is it's
[01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:27.640]  you just set it up so that you got like a 10 or 15 second open shutter and you
[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:31.120]  make sure you're using a remote and so you hear it go click and you know and
[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:35.200]  it's going to be open for about 10 seconds and it's going to be taking
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:38.280]  everything into that photo for 10 seconds and you can sit there and paint
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:43.000]  with the flashlight all the sections of the plant that you want and you can
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:46.840]  start doing some really fun stuff and backlight it and you know kind of go in
[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:51.600]  a circle you experiment with that and then it teaches you a lot about lighting
[01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:55.800]  and how things look so much different depending on the lighting that you have
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:59.840]  right a lot of a lot of people will get into photography and think well if I if
[01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:04.200]  I take a focused shot and I have a you know a nice white or black background
[01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:06.960]  it's gonna look great and you take the pictures and you look and you go why
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:12.080]  does it look like shit sure and it's because there's all this that goes on
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:16.560]  with lighting once you learn how to play with that and get better pictures with
[01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:20.120]  the lighting then it's then it's just kind of free range from there you can
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:23.440]  you can have fun with it and start getting creative and now I'm at the
[01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:26.760]  point where I can kind of think of what I want to take a picture of and then I
[01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:30.840]  recreate that and take that picture in the past I would just kind of set the
[01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:34.600]  plan up and take pictures from all these different angles with all this different
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:38.000]  lighting and I would spend probably two hours photographing it and then I would
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:42.240]  spend all day doing you know this really minimal processing like making sure that
[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:46.280]  the color correction was proper and stuff like that and cropping the photos
[01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:50.320]  down so I could put them on Instagram and I'd have you know 200 photos to go
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:55.040]  through so it would take me forever now I spend five minutes taking pictures I set
[01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:59.720]  it up it's real quick easy I take 30 or 40 photos and I pick the best 10 from
[01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:04.000]  there and crop them and do the minor little processing that I do I try not to
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:09.440]  change anything so all the photos I'm showing it's basically the raw image
[01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:14.880]  right but there's there's there's too much about photography to really give
[01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:19.240]  anyone a basic you know a general tip that they but that's one of the things
[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:22.520]  that I can say is get a camera where you can open the exposure and do a long
[01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:25.960]  shutter shot if you don't know what that means look it up it's easy to Google and
[01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:29.160]  you'll just you just you got to change this one little setting and it'll make
[01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:32.720]  your shutter instead of going snap snap and close it'll snap open and stay open
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:36.240]  and then you can use a flashlight and you'll you know it might have to get a
[01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:38.920]  couple different ones one that's a little brighter one that's a little you
[01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:42.480]  know not as bright and you'll find the right one or the right distance to hold
[01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:46.840]  it and you know play with that play with you know experiment with it get further
[01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:53.360]  away get real close until you see what type of light it looks best under and
[01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:57.000]  then you'll start to have a much better feel for lighting and once you get that
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:05.480]  feel for lighting then everything opens up nice yeah it's funny like you looking
[01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:13.320]  up to to Dynasty to Chris and his work it's like man he definitely is really
[01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:17.000]  pushed the photography to another level you know because there was guys you know
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:21.440]  there's guys like Ed Ed is an amazing photographer Ed is one of the original
[01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:25.920]  amazing photographers I mean I think you know I mean Mel Frank and those guys all
[01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:31.840]  back in the day took amazing photos and then it evolved into guys like Todd
[01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:37.520]  McCormick dynasty genetics and you know pushing and Todd does these layers and
[01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:43.360]  you know I mean he does some crazy photography and and then Chris has just
[01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:47.600]  taken it you know on the on the micro level where you're getting tricone heads
[01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:53.480]  and his pictures of males are amazing but like tricones resin glands are just
[01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:59.240]  friggin ridiculous it's funny it's funny how that has evolved along with you know
[01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:05.840]  with the internet and technology from Ed Ed's classic photos where it's like he
[01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:11.680]  does very you know traditional correct photos wants to get the whole plant you
[01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:16.200]  know it's whereas like some of these guys with the focus now you can do stuff
[01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:25.480]  with that it's just wild yeah yep it's it's it's really it's cool to see because
[01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:28.520]  there's a whole other kind of market you know you see there's certain
[01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:32.720]  photographers out there trying to think of the guys that resonated lens on
[01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:39.200]  Instagram and Tyler forget his last name is couple guys that are just fantastic
[01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:44.000]  photographers and at some point I love it that they decided I'm gonna take
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:49.080]  pictures of cannabis plants and set up other stuff and it's it's great being
[01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:53.720]  able to see these these really fantastic glamour shots you know and I grew up as
[01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:57.200]  a kid looking at those the Mel Frank and the Ed Rosenthal photos that are more
[01:06:57.200 --> 01:07:00.800]  like a you know New York Times reporter photo kind of thing and they were
[01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:07.760]  fantastic but there's less of an art form in those pictures in a sense the
[01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:11.360]  competition of it there's just as much art in there but the composition of it
[01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:15.240]  isn't quite as artistic if you're talking about you know certain parts of
[01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:19.320]  it and so it's really nice now that we live in an age where you've got these
[01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:24.080]  guys that are just taking these really fancy photographs of cannabis and we get
[01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:27.720]  to see all these different sides of it I remember the first time I saw a macro
[01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:31.760]  photo it just blew my mind because I had never really thought to you know
[01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:37.400]  take a magnifying glass to a bot and look at it really closely it's really
[01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:41.720]  interesting stuff yeah it's wild like with Ed and Mel and those guys
[01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:47.680]  especially Ed and what I've seen as friends with Ed it's like he puts the
[01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:51.280]  background together perfectly the lighting it's like it's pretty amazing
[01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:56.400]  but it's very it looks like how you would look into a room it's not the art
[01:07:56.520 --> 01:08:00.080]  in that sense his art is in the fact that it looks like you're looking into
[01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:03.880]  the room and everything's in focus and the lighting's perfect right and I
[01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:08.880]  didn't mean to make that sound negative if anyone's no no what I said totally
[01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:13.720]  it's the it's the it's that kind of the old-school way of taking photos it's a
[01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:17.200]  huge art form and there's there's nothing to take away from that but it's
[01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:22.360]  there's this new way that's more like a like fashion photography or something
[01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:27.280]  you know and that that to me is it's far more not necessarily appealing but
[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:30.640]  for people who aren't even into cannabis they can look at a photo of that and be
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:34.480]  like wow that's fantastic whereas you and I am and people like us are the only
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:38.440]  ones can really look at an old mill frank shot and appreciate that it's just
[01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:43.800]  a plant from you know 20 feet away yeah and some of the stuff is like New York
[01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:50.360]  1977 it's like right yeah you know the legality of taking photos you can go to
[01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:55.240]  prison for fucking taking photos of cannabis back then yeah those guys were
[01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:58.640]  in their own dark rooms processing their own photos because they just they
[01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:04.280]  literally couldn't do it any other way there's a lot to be said about that yeah
[01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:07.440]  I totally you go have those photos processed you could be going to prison
[01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:14.120]  for conspiracy pretty well mm-hmm yeah I still remember I mean back when I was a
[01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:17.880]  teenage kid we would snap photos of stuff and it was you had to take it to
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:22.080]  the one specific place to process your photos because you knew that guy wouldn't
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:25.480]  bust you because you'd heard about all kinds of other stories if you took it to
[01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:29.240]  the wrong place they might call the cops and you know then they're gonna show up
[01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:32.360]  it because you put your name and address so you had to change the name and address
[01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:37.720]  when you turn to drop the photos off and it was a whole thing with that totally
[01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:43.880]  yeah it's interesting how cannabis is just you know it's it's desensitized now
[01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:47.880]  too I mean in the sense where it was everyone was so scared people there's
[01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:51.640]  still people scared I mean I have friends in Humboldt that still got the
[01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:55.520]  tinfoil hats on and stuff like that and that's okay I I still can't shake a lot
[01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:59.200]  of it I mean I still can't shake a lot of it everything my dad taught me about
[01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:05.040]  being careful and it's really I mean I got fucking security cameras all over my
[01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:09.280]  property if someone comes to do work at my house a plumber or something I go hey
[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:14.080]  I go cannabis don't come back here I have guns and cameras and dogs just
[01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:17.320]  don't get the idea and I have the same talk with every one of them they look at
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:22.400]  me like I'm an asshole but I have to make it clear like I don't want shit to
[01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:25.120]  go down here I don't want to have to have the cops show up because I shot
[01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:29.640]  someone I don't want any of that it's just a plant but I know how I'm gonna
[01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:33.800]  react cuz I'm marine and I got fucking bad shit in my head I'm gonna snap and
[01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:38.920]  do things wrong so but I can't shake it you know I mean when I was a kid it was
[01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:43.040]  our house got raided I think about three different times that I remember clearly
[01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:47.560]  and every time our house got raided we got a phone call ahead of time and all
[01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:50.800]  these adults would come into our house and clear all this stuff out and I'd go
[01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:53.440]  across the street to the neighbor's house and watch through the window and
[01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:57.880]  all these cops would show up and ransack our house and not find a damn thing Wow
[01:10:57.880 --> 01:11:01.880]  and that was how my dad raised me was you do all these different things you
[01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:05.200]  know all the way up to even paying off clerks at the courthouse to make sure
[01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:09.640]  you know if you're gonna get raided to make sure that you're protected some way
[01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:14.200]  right because you can't do stuff like this without having levels of protection
[01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:20.640]  and layers of protection when I ended up doing time for cannabis I got I was
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:24.240]  working and doing a lot of interstate trafficking and stuff with several
[01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:30.280]  people and it was pretty big level stuff and I was buffered really carefully
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:35.800]  through several layers of people and I ended up getting busted because I got a
[01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:40.000]  green light turned left at intersection and got t-boned by someone who fled the
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:44.080]  scene and they were here illegally and they hit me and so they were afraid oh
[01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:47.720]  shit I'm gonna go to jail now and they took off I understand that on their part
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:53.080]  but CHP showed up and I had pounds in the back and payo sheets and all kinds
[01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:57.800]  of shit and had all these had all these patient records from what we were doing
[01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:01.640]  was we were also connected with Sacred Mountain dispensary in Santa Barbara
[01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:06.880]  that had all kinds of fucking legal issues but that was how they started with
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:10.000]  by giving us a bunch of patient records to pretend we were legal with what we
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:13.800]  were doing and you know I'm showing this CHP guy this stuff and I'm going oh
[01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:17.760]  that's all legit he went bullshit you just saw through it and I fought a court
[01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:21.400]  case for five years for that ended up doing quite a bit of time in prison for
[01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:26.840]  it but it's you know you don't forget those things and it's kind of people now
[01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:31.280]  on our end maybe it's a little bit you know I don't know annoying or sad or
[01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:34.920]  however you want to look at it but it's people have forgotten that how much
[01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:38.240]  those of us who have been around this our whole lives had to go through back
[01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:44.640]  in the 90s and before that for sure so many people have no clue even though yeah
[01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:48.080]  but it but it's also kind of nice that you know this the younger crowd that's
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:52.600]  getting into things doesn't have to deal with that they hear a helicopter they're
[01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:56.240]  not running under trees yeah god bless them that they don't look outside every
[01:12:56.240 --> 01:13:01.600]  time they hear a helicopter cuz I still fucking do yeah me too we have a genie
[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:04.880]  we have PG and E out just up here and whenever there's a helicopter flying
[01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:08.080]  around I get some Marine Corps PTSD going on and then I get some cannabis
[01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:14.280]  PTSD going on yeah I was at one of my friends grows not so long ago and there
[01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:20.320]  was a helicopter circling guy had a camera he was taking pictures and they
[01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:24.320]  got close and he was waving and giving us the big thumbs up and it's like
[01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:30.440]  totally changed you know yeah he just thought it was a great sight from the
[01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:34.440]  sky oh yeah totally like you could tell he was stoked about it and it's like
[01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:42.760]  back in the day you saw a helicopter man you run it more than likely yep so yeah
[01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:48.120]  well man let's see is there anything else that we forgot to talk about that
[01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:55.240]  you can remember where to get your seeds where yeah I think that's important
[01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:58.280]  where can people buy your seeds if they're looking to get some Romulan
[01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:04.960]  genetics yeah so the over this next year we just did our first drop me and cats
[01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:09.280]  whose seeds are doing a really big collaboration we did a feminized thing
[01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:13.960]  about it almost a year ago at this point and we dropped a couple feminized we
[01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:18.280]  made about 12 different cultivars but we didn't get hardly any seeds from it
[01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:22.200]  we got enough to drop two of them we dropped those and those sold out real
[01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:27.440]  quick and those have been just fantastic the space fuel is East Coast sour diesel
[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:32.000]  and Romulan is one of the best smokes I've ever smoked I mean it's just go
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.920]  straight she hadn't and literally send you to the moon that's why I decided to
[01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:40.440]  call it space fuel and it skyrocket not like heart racing and anxiety but one
[01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:45.480]  hell of a trip we did that and and cats do contact me I thought that was kind of
[01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:48.520]  the end of it you know that's my impression of collaborations as you do
[01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:51.600]  one thing and I didn't know that he was gonna cross it with 12 different stuff
[01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:55.360]  and when he told me that I was wow that's awesome it's great well I only
[01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:58.400]  got enough to do one or two releases and oh that's fine you know that's kind of
[01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:02.440]  what I expected we would do maybe one thing and then that would be it and he
[01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:06.680]  enjoyed my Romulan so much that he just kind of pulled a full stop on everything
[01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:10.080]  he was doing and just started breeding with my Romulan with all the stuff that
[01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:15.120]  he has and so he did this big cross and just pick some of the most amazing
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:21.320]  plants I mean he's got a cut of you dub you know we got JBC's cam a bunch of
[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:25.800]  just amazing cuts that he crossed it with and I ran it recently and tested
[01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:29.000]  everything and I've been smoking it we just dropped fritter bomb which is
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:33.960]  apple fritter and Romulan and that's gonna we're gonna do it a monthly
[01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:41.480]  release every month for about 13 months so over the next year it's gonna be all
[01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:45.960]  catsuit seeds Romulan genetics collaborations that are dropping and
[01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:53.600]  people can go to his Instagram which is cats who dot blue bird they can go there
[01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:55.760]  and find out where his seeds are available because he's got a bunch of
[01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:59.360]  different seed banks and he's got his own email and stuff that they can get
[01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:03.600]  him from there but from me we've got a website on our Instagram it's Romulan
[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:11.000]  genetics calm they can get seeds from there and I've got on our website there
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:14.840]  we've got a seed bank partners page that's got links and we've got about 12
[01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:20.400]  for 14 different seed bank partners now you can get seeds all the way from a
[01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:25.560]  seeds in Europe to the only seed banks we don't have right now is a Canadian
[01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:29.280]  one anyone listen out there's got a Canadian seed bank I really have a lot
[01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:33.080]  of customers that want someone in Canada to carry my seed so they don't have to
[01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:39.000]  keep a line on me to ship it over the border but with that said I we've been
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.800]  really lucky because of my past and stuff with trafficking and all that I
[01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:46.640]  know how to ship really well I know a lot of tricks I've had a hundred percent
[01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:50.400]  delivery on everything that I've shipped over the past two or three years and
[01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:54.280]  I've shipped stuff to almost every single country in the world
[01:16:56.760 --> 01:17:01.680]  nice so yeah they can they can go to the website that's where they're gonna find
[01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:05.160]  most of the stuff they get it from us direct but we've got you know well
[01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:09.920]  grown seeds Neptune seed bank golden ticket seed bank got a bunch of really
[01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:14.400]  good reputable seed banks that are carrying our gear and I'm in talks with
[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:19.080]  the seeds here now and a couple other people with getting carried by them and
[01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:22.800]  they're just kind of waiting for me to have more things available because a lot
[01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:27.200]  of times that I do drops it's I don't have much and I think sell out really
[01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:30.680]  fast we just did this drop on the 20th and it's almost all gone
[01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:38.520]  that's awesome I've been I've been severely blessed I mean the followers
[01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:42.520]  that I have and the customers that I have I I couldn't ask for better people
[01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:48.160]  to be interested in what I'm doing I've had a lot of people just offer me heaps
[01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:54.480]  of support and love I know there there's a lot of insecurity and times you doing
[01:17:54.480 --> 01:18:00.080]  this where you feel like you know I don't I think I suck I'm not good at
[01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:05.920]  this and I know that I'm still way in that level to be realistic I I don't
[01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:10.120]  quite know what I'm doing entirely and I'm learning every day but I have so
[01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:13.360]  much to learn to get better at this but I have a lot of people that are
[01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:18.360]  understanding of that and and keep coming back and buying more seeds and
[01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:23.800]  it's it's a hell of a good feeling to have that the amount of support that I
[01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:27.760]  have from people you know I deal with a small handful of people that are
[01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:32.880]  doubters and haters but everyone else is just pouring on the love and it really
[01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:37.000]  helps it's it's helped me to get through this and get through the mistakes that I
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:41.240]  make and learn to get better every day totally yeah I mean I'm still learning
[01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:45.400]  too and there's always gonna be haters I get haters there's haters that means
[01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:48.840]  you're doing something right and I think the self-doubt stuff is just gonna
[01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:52.960]  happen no matter what you do if you if you think you got it all figured out
[01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:57.280]  that you more than likely don't yeah that's that's something I've said to
[01:18:57.280 --> 01:19:01.640]  people most of my life adult life is if you think you're an expert at something
[01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:05.200]  you shouldn't do it anymore yeah especially with cannabis we're
[01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:08.680]  dealing with the most genetically diverse plant on the planet that's
[01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:15.760]  cultivated by humans I think there's just so much to it and you know being a
[01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:19.560]  specialist is one thing and you can specialize in certain things but nobody
[01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:24.960]  knows everything and the beauty of the the white market the metric system that
[01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:35.560]  we have in place is the fact that you can specialize in stuff yeah that was a
[01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:40.360]  little bit too big yeah and that's that's something I think that uh you
[01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:44.200]  know if there are people listening that are thinking about getting into the
[01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:47.360]  industry as breeders or you know trying to break into it they've been breeding
[01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:52.680]  for a while is that's that's one of the biggest recommendations I can make is
[01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:57.560]  try to find your niche and and start with what you like to smoke so if you're
[01:19:57.560 --> 01:20:03.920]  an OG gas couch lock that's what you love make that your niche you know make
[01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:06.440]  that what you what you enjoy working with because if it's something you're
[01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:10.160]  comfortable with and know very well at least the effects in what you're looking
[01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:15.480]  for then your work is gonna shine in that area and I see a lot of breeders
[01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:19.360]  where I look at their crosses I'm like is there any rhyme or reason to this no
[01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:23.200]  there's not with most people and I feel like people think they're gonna get into
[01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:27.800]  breeding because they're gonna make money and I think the natural transition
[01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:33.080]  is to be a really good grower first and then become a really good breeder you're
[01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:37.920]  gonna you're gonna go from one to the next a lot easier express and if you
[01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:41.920]  can't make the plant express what are you doing you're making seeds and you're
[01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:45.200]  you're not a lot of people I think there's a confusion too I think there's
[01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:48.960]  a lot of people that are seed producers and not actual breeders there's a
[01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:53.360]  difference just if you made seeds and you bred the seeds together doesn't mean
[01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:57.160]  you're a breeder you you can produce seeds without being a breeder you're not
[01:20:57.160 --> 01:21:01.480]  doing any back crossing if you're not doing it you know working towards a line
[01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:05.560]  stabilization if you're just making seeds you're a seed producer yeah and
[01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:10.040]  you know and there's a lot of work that goes into breeding as far as like
[01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:14.640]  testing and going back and forth and you know there's there's nothing wrong with
[01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:17.920]  being a seed producer either and but as far as like the money don't do it for
[01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:21.800]  the money right out do it because you're passionate about it I mean there's so
[01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:25.680]  many people that are like yeah I've seed seed breeders breeders they make hella
[01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:28.800]  money and it's like I would say that most breeders don't make hella money I
[01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:32.800]  think it's something that happens over time and there's a lot of struggle you
[01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:35.920]  know you're just like artists man artists struggle there's a lot of
[01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:40.400]  artists musicians and otherwise that there's a lot of artists out there that
[01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:44.620]  don't make a ton of money breeding isn't all about money it's about making good
[01:21:44.620 --> 01:21:50.620]  genetics you become successful because you've done it right yep that's I'm
[01:21:50.620 --> 01:21:54.580]  still if I look at the bottom line for how much I've invested and put in I'm
[01:21:54.580 --> 01:21:58.940]  still in the red I still haven't actually profited money breeding I've
[01:21:58.940 --> 01:22:06.060]  invested far more into this than I've really made at it yet and that's I don't
[01:22:06.060 --> 01:22:09.460]  know you know I do I hear a lot of people that wow you know you made that
[01:22:09.460 --> 01:22:14.020]  much from selling those seeds that's $10,000 that's crazy and I'm like well
[01:22:14.140 --> 01:22:19.300]  yeah but that was a year's worth of work and the electricity the water bill the
[01:22:19.300 --> 01:22:24.260]  soil the nutrients it adds up the packaging the labor for people that I
[01:22:24.260 --> 01:22:28.100]  pay to help me do this if I didn't have a sales manager I would not be able to
[01:22:28.100 --> 01:22:34.420]  do this on my own and those things add up real quick to where you just don't
[01:22:34.420 --> 01:22:38.780]  make much money and I you know I one of my seed banks I told him you know he
[01:22:38.780 --> 01:22:43.060]  said hey can we can we drop the price on this you know instead of 75 wholesale
[01:22:43.100 --> 01:22:47.180]  can it be 50 and I said brother I'll make five to ten dollars per pack at the
[01:22:47.180 --> 01:22:52.180]  most if I do it for 50 and that's that's the truth I'm not able to make that many
[01:22:52.180 --> 01:22:55.740]  seeds and I think people kind of assume that well you pollinate you're gonna
[01:22:55.740 --> 01:22:59.740]  have 20,000 seeds and if you see it's worth 10 bucks shit you just made
[01:22:59.740 --> 01:23:04.180]  almost a quarter million dollars no it doesn't work that way because to be able
[01:23:04.180 --> 01:23:08.020]  to have 200,000 seeds you know you've got to have a pretty big facility you
[01:23:08.020 --> 01:23:12.260]  gotta have a lot of plants unless you're doing it outdoor and then it's not as
[01:23:12.260 --> 01:23:16.700]  you know as careful as you can't guarantee that it hasn't been tainted by
[01:23:16.700 --> 01:23:21.900]  a neighbor or something oh yeah yeah you can make 10 million seeds per acre you
[01:23:21.900 --> 01:23:24.780]  know that's it that's an actual fact you can even make 20 million seeds per acre
[01:23:24.780 --> 01:23:28.980]  I think but 10 million is an easily achievable number but the thing is is
[01:23:28.980 --> 01:23:32.500]  with all the pollen out there the likelihood that if you're growing an
[01:23:32.500 --> 01:23:36.140]  acre that you're not going to be contaminated on some level by you know
[01:23:36.140 --> 01:23:40.140]  pollen there's no pollen mitigation you're fucked you know and so then
[01:23:40.140 --> 01:23:43.020]  you're selling seeds that are contaminated with other people's pollen
[01:23:43.020 --> 01:23:47.220]  more than likely hemp pollen now you're looking at you're looking at selling
[01:23:47.220 --> 01:23:53.980]  shit but you know people hear the number 15 million or 10 million seeds per acre
[01:23:53.980 --> 01:23:58.380]  and they're like I want to do that the dollar a seed and it's not always the
[01:23:58.380 --> 01:24:03.420]  case you know mm-hmm yeah everyone that's uh you know everyone that I know
[01:24:03.420 --> 01:24:07.660]  that's a grower is they don't have filtered intake in the room you know
[01:24:07.660 --> 01:24:11.500]  everyone's got the you know an exhaust filter and I want the smell to get out
[01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:15.780]  and I you know I had when I first started doing this I realized pretty
[01:24:15.780 --> 01:24:20.140]  quickly okay I got to have an airtight sealed room and I have to have hepa
[01:24:20.140 --> 01:24:26.380]  filtered intakes because it's all you yeah yeah pollen can get in here and you
[01:24:26.380 --> 01:24:29.460]  don't you know so so many people don't even realize that there's that part of
[01:24:29.460 --> 01:24:32.540]  it you know and I see a lot of breeders that start out and they're doing a tent
[01:24:32.540 --> 01:24:36.540]  in a bedroom or a tent in a garage or something like that and the tent only
[01:24:36.540 --> 01:24:39.580]  has an exhaust on it and you have no idea what your neighbor's doing right
[01:24:39.580 --> 01:24:44.380]  next door to you you know so there's that you can run into some issues along
[01:24:44.380 --> 01:24:47.780]  the way and you're looking at it going why the hell am I seeing that plant pop
[01:24:47.780 --> 01:24:50.540]  up all the other ones look pretty much the same and then there's this weird
[01:24:50.540 --> 01:24:55.500]  plant that's funky and throwing herms and well you know that may just be
[01:24:55.500 --> 01:24:59.900]  because your your room isn't airtight and yeah there's a lot of things that
[01:24:59.900 --> 01:25:05.420]  you trial and error that you run into a lot well even on a sealed room if you
[01:25:05.420 --> 01:25:08.300]  have any sort of negative pressure or you have an outtake I mean a lot of
[01:25:08.300 --> 01:25:13.340]  people just scrub but uh-hmm you know it's like if you do have any sort of
[01:25:13.340 --> 01:25:16.940]  intake it definitely hepa filtration it's only a couple hundred bucks to put
[01:25:16.940 --> 01:25:21.620]  you cut a hole put one of those hepa filters in it's real easy it's not you
[01:25:21.620 --> 01:25:26.440]  know yeah a lot to it yeah I went from just you know single now I have
[01:25:26.440 --> 01:25:30.220]  everything's double hepa filtered I've got you know two different layers of
[01:25:30.220 --> 01:25:35.940]  hepa just a peace of mind I mean the real positive pressure is better than
[01:25:35.940 --> 01:25:39.860]  negative pressure yeah you know you want to be want to be trying to push things
[01:25:39.860 --> 01:25:46.500]  from getting in right excellent well do we have any questions from the audience
[01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:49.500]  still looks like we got a bunch of people watching so you guys got to have
[01:25:49.500 --> 01:25:56.200]  some good questions for us what do you got
[01:25:56.200 --> 01:26:10.480]  hold on what are you doing Peter you eating a salad this is all cauliflower
[01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:30.120]  seeds Wow I've been productive while you guys were talking but we did have well
[01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:33.600]  Chad what Chad Westport has a good one it says what tends to be the problem
[01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:38.360]  with reversing under LEDs is it leaf surface temp lighting spectrum I know
[01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:41.780]  some of the red far reds have been studied for seed development I would say
[01:26:41.780 --> 01:26:48.080]  that it's the spectrums and I believe it has to do with the hormonal changes with
[01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:52.440]  the LEDs you're getting a you know different hormones and hormone ratios
[01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:57.760]  and and I'm not a hundred percent sure what it is but I know it to be a fact
[01:26:57.760 --> 01:27:06.680]  that LEDs do not get the reversals as well as using HPS so we will find out I
[01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:10.240]  mean I have some people really looking into it right now there's a couple
[01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:15.120]  lighting companies that are real curious about that as well so I've got some
[01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:18.600]  people sending me lights if you want to send me some lights to test that would
[01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:23.200]  be great I'd love to get lights that's that's my guess too is it's it's got
[01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:26.840]  something to do with the spectrum yeah and what that spectrum does is it
[01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:29.960]  changed there's hormonal changes that go on with different spectrums for sure
[01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:34.720]  yeah and it's that those those first seven to fourteen days that there's a
[01:27:34.720 --> 01:27:38.520]  lot of it's like puberty for a plant there's a lot of hormonal and chemical
[01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:44.000]  changes happening that right okay especially especially if you're dusting
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:51.360]  it with reversal spray yeah so Wes Martin TV asked do small seeds mean
[01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:55.120]  anything I've recently finished my second breeding project but my seeds
[01:27:55.120 --> 01:28:07.000]  come out tiny yeah throw them away they're garbage yeah it's funny because
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:10.720]  uh you know a lot of people were confused the thing is this seeds can be
[01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:17.400]  anything from a point zero zero eight to a point two I mean they can go from
[01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:21.480]  basically really small to bigger the point two zeros I even saw some point
[01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:28.320]  recently that are like three times the size of normal seeds light intensity can
[01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:32.920]  dictate seed size to a degree it can affect it I wouldn't say it dictates it
[01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:37.120]  totally but it can affect it so HPS I believe because the calyx are so swole
[01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:42.120]  under HPS the seeds have a harder time growing if they're not tiger striped
[01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:47.960]  that's okay too I mean what would you say Jake as far as a seed size so I know
[01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:53.040]  that there's a lot of I don't know I call it Instagram information
[01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:58.320]  misinformation people or you know they expect what they're told is if it's not
[01:28:58.320 --> 01:29:02.720]  this huge big seed that's fully tiger striped and really dark in color that
[01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:05.360]  it's not a healthy seed it's not viable and they're not going to get a plant
[01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:09.120]  from it but I mean you and I know and I'm just about every grower knows out
[01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:12.360]  there that that's not true you can plant a tiny white seed and you still get a
[01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:18.920]  plant pop up it's it's more about the ease of propagation if something is
[01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:24.880]  fully formed has a proper shell on it you know in the nice tiger striping it's
[01:29:24.880 --> 01:29:28.760]  gonna be easier to germinate it's gonna be easier to turn it into a plant but it
[01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:34.080]  doesn't mean because it's a smaller seed or a bigger seed or miss colored that
[01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:41.360]  it's going to not be viable totally I see a lot of stuff that is genetically
[01:29:41.440 --> 01:29:44.920]  influenced so certain crosses that I make will no matter how long I've run
[01:29:44.920 --> 01:29:48.520]  them and how healthy the seeds are they're really small really really small
[01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:53.440]  little guys and other ones make huge fat seeds I mean four or five times the size
[01:29:53.440 --> 01:29:58.160]  of a normal seed I've got a new cross I made old-time moonshine BJ Schwartz
[01:29:58.160 --> 01:30:02.360]  moonshine in my Romulan and I'm calling it blood wine and the seeds are I mean
[01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:07.480]  almost as big as my pinky nail they're just huge and all the other stuff you
[01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:10.520]  know the normal size and then I've got some other things that are really really
[01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:15.720]  tiny the shram and Romulan back cross thing that I did the seeds were tiny
[01:30:15.720 --> 01:30:22.240]  tiny seeds and I ended up giving those away as freebies because the seeds were
[01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:25.920]  so small I knew people were gonna look at them when they got the pack and think
[01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:29.840]  well I've been ripped off for sure but everyone everyone that I've given my way
[01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:33.120]  as freebies that has grown them has been like wow these are fantastic these are
[01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:38.160]  really great I didn't have germination problems nothing so if you've bred stuff
[01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:40.800]  and you're looking at the seeds as being small don't panic about that at
[01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:46.960]  all the best advice I can give in that scenario is give several handfuls out to
[01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:50.320]  growers that you know we're gonna pop them as soon as possible and let them
[01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:53.480]  see what happens and give you feedback on it and if everything's good to go
[01:30:53.480 --> 01:31:01.120]  then don't worry about it yeah yeah I definitely so it can be influenced I
[01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:04.800]  mean I've had experience I did both inside and outside and they were they
[01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:09.720]  weren't quite double but they were definitely bigger seeds so it's it is
[01:31:09.720 --> 01:31:14.640]  definitely genetic and I mean I think there's genetic obviously and also
[01:31:14.640 --> 01:31:19.920]  outdoors it's not one or the other it's both but I read someone in the comments
[01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:24.560]  saying that it's definitely not genetics and it is genetics but it's also you
[01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:28.080]  know it's also contributing factors like light intensity I think those things
[01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:32.480]  make a big difference but uh you know tiger striping is another one just get
[01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:36.120]  into that real quick tiger striping you can rub that tiger striping off it's
[01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:39.200]  almost like printed and you know if you grow something that's really purple and
[01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:44.240]  the seeds come out looking purple the antho cayenne coloring you can rub that
[01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:47.480]  off with your fingers too and you know you'll get your hands all purple yeah
[01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:52.200]  that that tiger stripe coating is is meant to protect it in nature when it
[01:31:52.200 --> 01:31:56.080]  falls down the ground that's right it's gonna harden over time it's gonna
[01:31:56.080 --> 01:32:00.260]  thicken and then when the situation is right that tiger striping if you look
[01:32:00.260 --> 01:32:05.580]  really closely in a macro photo there's almost like channels and it helps move
[01:32:05.580 --> 01:32:09.100]  the water into the perforations and the seed that are gonna open up and pull
[01:32:09.100 --> 01:32:13.620]  that water into the embryo yeah at least that's that's my theory I don't know if
[01:32:13.620 --> 01:32:20.940]  that's true little camouflage action going on there too yeah yeah so what
[01:32:20.940 --> 01:32:26.540]  else we got breeding from clone versus so so here's the thing like breeding
[01:32:26.540 --> 01:32:32.140]  from auto flower you got to breed from seed breeding from clone I would say
[01:32:32.140 --> 01:32:35.940]  bleep breeding from clone is ideal breeding from seed if you're just
[01:32:35.940 --> 01:32:39.820]  breeding from seed you you know how do you know the expression you know it's
[01:32:39.820 --> 01:32:42.980]  like you're not good if you're breeding from seed and you're just doing an open
[01:32:42.980 --> 01:32:47.560]  pollination to make more seeds it's kind of a you know an interesting thing to do
[01:32:47.560 --> 01:32:51.740]  at times but I don't think that's good I would say that if you're breeding from
[01:32:51.740 --> 01:32:55.700]  clone at least you can put all your receivers the plants that are gonna get
[01:32:55.740 --> 01:32:59.660]  pollen you can take all those and they're all the exact same thing so if
[01:32:59.660 --> 01:33:03.300]  you're doing five different ones you have however many of those that are
[01:33:03.300 --> 01:33:08.420]  clones you know you're getting the same results with all your seeds right so
[01:33:08.420 --> 01:33:11.540]  it's funny what my brain does when people ask me that question as I think I
[01:33:11.540 --> 01:33:17.140]  immediately do this odd separation where I think clones well then that's you know
[01:33:17.140 --> 01:33:21.060]  clones being passed around yeah so if you're gonna breed from that that's you
[01:33:21.060 --> 01:33:25.540]  know it's like kind of like saying elites or whatever that's what my brain
[01:33:25.540 --> 01:33:30.420]  does when I think of that question but what I actually do for my breeding I've
[01:33:30.420 --> 01:33:34.620]  done a couple things that were from clone cuts that I received but most of
[01:33:34.620 --> 01:33:40.540]  what I do is I hunt from seed first find what I like clone that keep it and then
[01:33:40.540 --> 01:33:45.300]  breed with it so in the end I'm always breeding with a clone because I have to
[01:33:45.300 --> 01:33:49.120]  run what I'm breeding with first to know what its expressions are if it has
[01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:53.660]  intersex traits if it's got some negative things about it whatever it may
[01:33:53.660 --> 01:33:56.820]  be whether it's you know it's gonna bring in a penchant towards powdery
[01:33:56.820 --> 01:34:00.940]  mildew or something those are things I want to know ahead of time so I can look
[01:34:00.940 --> 01:34:06.060]  for him during testing specifically more for that than some of the other things
[01:34:06.060 --> 01:34:12.580]  so I'm always breeding with a clone in the end but what I prefer to do is start
[01:34:12.580 --> 01:34:19.060]  with seed because to me it's I'm coming up with something more unique and it's a
[01:34:19.060 --> 01:34:25.300]  little bit more of a challenge for me because I this is nothing negative
[01:34:25.300 --> 01:34:29.460]  against people that do this in any way it's my own personal choice I don't like
[01:34:29.460 --> 01:34:33.940]  breeding from clones because it's too easy I mean I can talk to people and
[01:34:33.940 --> 01:34:37.540]  they can say oh yeah you know if you breed with Gary Payton or you breed with
[01:34:37.540 --> 01:34:43.060]  you know this this JB Kim cut it's gonna be fantastic so all the guesswork is
[01:34:43.060 --> 01:34:47.860]  gone for me I can I know that almost everything I read Romulan with comes out
[01:34:47.860 --> 01:34:51.620]  pretty damn decent if not fantastic anyway because I'm starting with a great
[01:34:51.620 --> 01:34:56.340]  cut sure so if I pair it with another great cut then it's really the only
[01:34:56.340 --> 01:35:01.100]  thought process in my head is what kind of carryover is each parent gonna bring
[01:35:01.100 --> 01:35:06.220]  you know what's it gonna mesh into so I would say that sexual maturity is
[01:35:06.220 --> 01:35:09.380]  something that's important if you're going from seed you need to if you're
[01:35:09.380 --> 01:35:13.220]  pheno hunting you should grow it out a minimum of two times ideally three times
[01:35:13.220 --> 01:35:19.340]  to see how the expression changes the plant matures sexually over time I think
[01:35:19.340 --> 01:35:22.780]  for me for me that's what I like you know and then make a clone of that
[01:35:22.780 --> 01:35:28.220]  there where you can replicate and you go to town I'll do a couple different grows
[01:35:28.220 --> 01:35:32.820]  I'll do like one under LED one under HPS and if I if it's the right time of year
[01:35:32.820 --> 01:35:38.140]  I'll try to do one outdoor with stuff that I breed with and all I always do
[01:35:38.140 --> 01:35:43.660]  one very intentional thing is all pull it like about a week early and then I'll
[01:35:43.660 --> 01:35:48.020]  try to pull it as late as I can take it you know I have one that's when it's
[01:35:48.020 --> 01:35:50.860]  just right one harvest where it's you know the ambers and everything's just
[01:35:50.860 --> 01:35:55.220]  right one where I pull it a week early where it's not even quite milky yet one
[01:35:55.220 --> 01:35:59.580]  where I pull it as late as I can take it where the plan is still alive and growing
[01:35:59.580 --> 01:36:04.380]  and doing its thing to see the difference in because I think a lot of
[01:36:04.380 --> 01:36:08.260]  people make mistakes with that home growers hobby growers make mistakes with
[01:36:08.260 --> 01:36:12.660]  when to harvest I know I personally when I started I harvested everything way too
[01:36:12.660 --> 01:36:16.380]  soon because I was antsy and I didn't have the patience to let it get to where
[01:36:16.380 --> 01:36:20.460]  it was fully ripe and I would start to see that you know when you get from like
[01:36:20.460 --> 01:36:24.900]  weeks you know the bulking weeks of five six and seven or whatever and then you
[01:36:24.900 --> 01:36:28.100]  see that that change where it's getting close to being done where it's starting
[01:36:28.100 --> 01:36:32.740]  to visibly changes I would see that first change and go shit it's ready you
[01:36:32.740 --> 01:36:36.940]  know that all the hairs are colored it's ready and then I learned over time
[01:36:36.940 --> 01:36:42.140]  you know how to be patient wait and realize that there's a huge payoff if
[01:36:42.140 --> 01:36:45.980]  you can wait another week or two and when I learned someone told me and they
[01:36:45.980 --> 01:36:49.780]  said you know when you think it's ready wait a week and I started using that and
[01:36:49.780 --> 01:36:53.940]  it that was it's not a failsafe that I use every time now now I go on you know
[01:36:53.940 --> 01:36:58.060]  and use a microscope and everything but that's a good place to start if you feel
[01:36:58.060 --> 01:37:00.460]  like you're always pulling stuff a little too soon because you're impatient
[01:37:00.620 --> 01:37:05.260]  whether it is what soon as you think it's ready just bite your lip give it
[01:37:05.260 --> 01:37:08.140]  another seven days and come back and pull it at that point and you'll see the
[01:37:08.140 --> 01:37:12.180]  difference in smoke is it's quite a big change it still smells like hey you
[01:37:12.180 --> 01:37:19.220]  might need to wait two weeks exactly exactly so yeah we got someone saying so
[01:37:19.220 --> 01:37:24.360]  would you consider would you consider auto breeding is harder or just pollen
[01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:27.740]  checkers it's a lot harder I mean reading good autos is very difficult
[01:37:27.740 --> 01:37:30.420]  it's one of the things there's only a handful of guys that breed good autos
[01:37:30.420 --> 01:37:35.660]  and that's why yeah because it's difficult yeah and I mean there's a lot
[01:37:35.660 --> 01:37:41.060]  more to it than just observation I now with with analytics we can test for all
[01:37:41.060 --> 01:37:44.900]  kinds of amazing things we can test for sexual maturity cannabinoid profiles
[01:37:44.900 --> 01:37:49.500]  terpene profiles you can you can actually use analytical data to breed
[01:37:49.500 --> 01:37:53.180]  now and autos I feel like it's it's necessary to take it to that point
[01:37:53.180 --> 01:37:56.340]  there's some people that do good in small batches but if you're looking at
[01:37:56.340 --> 01:37:59.300]  people that are making millions of autos they're doing it with analytics
[01:37:59.300 --> 01:38:03.340]  yeah oh yeah it's a lot more difficult and you know you're talking about a
[01:38:03.340 --> 01:38:08.380]  two-year project rather than a one-year project at the very minimum it's two
[01:38:08.380 --> 01:38:13.780]  years to breed a good auto variety from a photo period strength exactly well
[01:38:13.780 --> 01:38:16.980]  there's there's it feels like to me and I wouldn't know cuz I haven't bred auto
[01:38:16.980 --> 01:38:20.820]  flowers myself yet I kind of took a small little dabble in that area and I
[01:38:20.820 --> 01:38:26.540]  have a full understanding of what you have to do to breed them but it's a
[01:38:26.540 --> 01:38:33.180]  there's a much more scruples that's not the right word market for people who
[01:38:33.180 --> 01:38:37.540]  grow out of flowers I mean there are a lot of hobby auto flower growers but it
[01:38:37.540 --> 01:38:43.300]  seems like there's a lot more commercial and people who really know what they're
[01:38:43.300 --> 01:38:46.260]  doing that are buying up those auto flowers and so when they get them from
[01:38:46.260 --> 01:38:51.220]  people that haven't done the work properly they don't stick around but you
[01:38:51.220 --> 01:38:54.420]  know that's why you look and you see that there's four or five guys that are
[01:38:54.420 --> 01:38:57.620]  still doing it and doing it regularly and they do it well and that's why
[01:38:57.620 --> 01:39:01.020]  they're still around but if you've paid attention over the past five years
[01:39:01.020 --> 01:39:04.340]  there have been a lot of people make out of flowers come up drop a few things
[01:39:04.340 --> 01:39:10.500]  and never make anything again yeah yeah that's for sure it's it's wild the whole
[01:39:10.500 --> 01:39:15.820]  auto flower game is pretty interesting I couldn't believe when I heard from a
[01:39:15.820 --> 01:39:20.380]  distributor how much money auto flower companies make fucking blue yeah I mean
[01:39:20.380 --> 01:39:23.500]  the thing is is if you're talking about auto flowers a lot of people will plant
[01:39:23.500 --> 01:39:29.460]  15,000 per acre and so most the real auto flower money comes from AG and you
[01:39:29.460 --> 01:39:34.180]  know the best auto flower growers are actually like tomato tomato farmers guys
[01:39:34.180 --> 01:39:39.540]  that work with row crops seem to be better when really good cannabis farmers
[01:39:39.540 --> 01:39:42.780]  start to grow them outside and they've never worked with others before they
[01:39:42.780 --> 01:39:46.180]  tend to over water them they tend to treat them like cannabis plants when
[01:39:46.180 --> 01:39:51.900]  they should be treated like a row crop yep yeah so I have a buddy in Canada
[01:39:51.900 --> 01:39:54.900]  that sent me some stuff that he made and you know I started to grow it and he was
[01:39:54.900 --> 01:39:58.100]  giving me these tips on how you have to grow auto flowers differently than you
[01:39:58.100 --> 01:40:02.340]  do regular cannabis and it surprised me how there was so many different some of
[01:40:02.340 --> 01:40:08.060]  them are minor but some of them are pretty big yeah someone says what's my
[01:40:08.060 --> 01:40:14.220]  favorite true purple variety to breed with you know I love I love purple
[01:40:14.220 --> 01:40:18.980]  varieties to like GDP back in the day was one of my favorites I would say that
[01:40:18.980 --> 01:40:23.780]  I hated vegging it for 31 days that was a pain in the ass but uh you know Mendo
[01:40:23.780 --> 01:40:30.380]  perps was good one as well but a purple as far as you know I don't know there's
[01:40:30.380 --> 01:40:34.140]  there's a lot of purple varieties I like gelato 41 which is somewhat purple I
[01:40:34.140 --> 01:40:40.300]  think gelato 41 is a great breeder and a great variety Peter I know you got
[01:40:40.300 --> 01:40:44.060]  more questions for us I saw something about an f4 up there if you're going to
[01:40:44.060 --> 01:40:50.220]  femme f4 stable line from regs would you choose one phenotype or multiple phenos
[01:40:50.220 --> 01:40:56.380]  for donors to make a line well there are we talking about autos are we talking
[01:40:56.380 --> 01:41:00.660]  about except from regs we'll just talk about regular seeds if you're doing an
[01:41:00.660 --> 01:41:05.700]  f4 stable line to choose one for you know if you're going to f4 to make an f5
[01:41:05.700 --> 01:41:11.260]  you would use one yeah you know you would use one variety and you would use
[01:41:11.260 --> 01:41:14.660]  the one that resembled the parents the most you know there's testing now you
[01:41:14.660 --> 01:41:20.780]  can do to you know actually see how close it is to the parent but uh that
[01:41:20.780 --> 01:41:24.780]  you're breeding towards but I would say as far as what you're doing if you're
[01:41:24.780 --> 01:41:28.220]  just doing a you're a hobbyist and you're breeding and you're trying to
[01:41:28.220 --> 01:41:33.780]  make it inbred line what you do is you try to breed as close to that goal each
[01:41:33.780 --> 01:41:38.500]  time so if you're doing an f f1 you select something in your f1 you keep
[01:41:38.500 --> 01:41:42.740]  breeding towards that thing that you liked about the f1 and some of those
[01:41:42.740 --> 01:41:45.620]  things may change over time but really what you're trying to do is create
[01:41:45.620 --> 01:41:49.300]  something that has less phenotypical variation that's why you keep crossing
[01:41:49.300 --> 01:41:54.900]  it until you get that and you know I think f1s have the most vigor we can
[01:41:54.900 --> 01:41:58.660]  talk about heterosis if you guys want for a little bit but heterosis is
[01:41:58.660 --> 01:42:02.420]  hybrid vigor that comes from taking two things that are genetically different
[01:42:02.420 --> 01:42:10.220]  and crossing them together to get a hybrid so that that true f1 is is rarely
[01:42:10.220 --> 01:42:13.860]  seen in cannabis because we all work with complex polyhybrids that have so
[01:42:13.860 --> 01:42:22.110]  many different lines in them yeah so yeah good stuff but yeah someone says
[01:42:22.110 --> 01:42:25.830]  I'm in my second reversal of gelato 41 and I found a little black beauty that
[01:42:25.830 --> 01:42:31.550]  I'm calling black beauty so black beauty is actually a THC V variety so I
[01:42:31.550 --> 01:42:37.150]  probably change it to something else yeah yeah that's that's tough part is
[01:42:37.150 --> 01:42:41.230]  naming naming cultivars at this point totally you guys got to really research
[01:42:41.230 --> 01:42:44.670]  it I mean if you come up with an original name for your company you could
[01:42:44.670 --> 01:42:49.430]  call it you know like like Romulan it's really easy because you put Ron Romulan
[01:42:49.430 --> 01:42:52.910]  with stuff you know you got the Romulan name but like loud for me I can put loud
[01:42:52.910 --> 01:42:57.910]  in front of any anything so you you put your name and you could you could kind
[01:42:57.910 --> 01:43:02.150]  of change that towards it but things like black beauty things like sorcerer
[01:43:02.150 --> 01:43:09.470]  something I don't think that's been taken whatever that word was but the
[01:43:09.470 --> 01:43:13.550]  thing is is like you can really you know you can get creative with stuff but you
[01:43:13.550 --> 01:43:18.270]  got to realize that there's so many names already taken out there so and I
[01:43:18.270 --> 01:43:21.710]  think another thing you know we're on the subject of naming conventions I
[01:43:21.830 --> 01:43:25.910]  think a lot of people they they'll name their strain before they test them out
[01:43:25.910 --> 01:43:29.590]  and grow them to see if it's actually something that represents that like
[01:43:29.590 --> 01:43:33.470]  they'll call something bury this or freaking chocolate this and it won't
[01:43:33.470 --> 01:43:37.310]  have any berry or chocolate smell I just have a problem with that I think you
[01:43:37.310 --> 01:43:43.070]  should grow it out test it and have the the name represent what the variety is
[01:43:43.070 --> 01:43:47.070]  you know if it's a berry smell that's fine you call it a berry thing but if it
[01:43:47.070 --> 01:43:53.070]  doesn't smell like berries why are you putting Barry in the name right people
[01:43:53.070 --> 01:43:57.150]  that will do a big feminized release where they cross something with no cherry
[01:43:57.150 --> 01:44:01.070]  soda is the is the male donor and everything everything gets named
[01:44:01.070 --> 01:44:05.750]  something soda and it's confusing for people that are growers that don't
[01:44:05.750 --> 01:44:11.790]  understand that's just a name yeah or someone gets a real creative bug and
[01:44:11.790 --> 01:44:15.030]  they make up some crazy stuff and it has nothing to do with either one of the
[01:44:15.030 --> 01:44:20.670]  parents and I mean it happens all the time yeah and you know it's interesting
[01:44:20.670 --> 01:44:26.110]  I've tried to keep things as close to understandable as I can but it's it's
[01:44:26.110 --> 01:44:29.710]  such a pain in the ass when you you have something you smoke it like I'll have
[01:44:29.710 --> 01:44:34.110]  I'll get a harvest and I'll have people come over and we'll have a naming party
[01:44:34.110 --> 01:44:37.110]  kind of thing you know we'll all smoke it and we'll try to come up with these
[01:44:37.110 --> 01:44:41.190]  brainstorm ideas of what we can name it and then we'll be sitting there
[01:44:41.190 --> 01:44:45.510]  cross-checking everything you know looking up hashtags on Instagram and
[01:44:45.510 --> 01:44:50.350]  Facebook and then checking Google and then checking forums to see if maybe
[01:44:50.350 --> 01:44:55.190]  there's just some rare cut out there that's named this and once you get into
[01:44:55.190 --> 01:44:58.270]  it you realize there's all kinds of different areas you have to actually
[01:44:58.270 --> 01:45:03.510]  look and then you'll still have problems you'll still have stuff where you choose
[01:45:03.510 --> 01:45:08.270]  the name you didn't see it anywhere and uh and then sure shit someone I just had
[01:45:08.270 --> 01:45:11.990]  a thing with dojo seeds where we we named something Cold Stone and he had
[01:45:11.990 --> 01:45:16.230]  done a release like in 2015 of a straining called Cold Stoned and I we
[01:45:16.230 --> 01:45:19.470]  looked everywhere we had multiple people looking it up and we couldn't didn't see
[01:45:19.470 --> 01:45:23.950]  anything named Cold Stoned and right as I started putting out information about
[01:45:23.950 --> 01:45:29.190]  this pending release down the road then he he was the attention was brought to
[01:45:29.190 --> 01:45:32.830]  him and you know everything ended up fine in the end we changed the name it's
[01:45:32.830 --> 01:45:36.790]  not a big deal but it it sucks when you have something that you're like oh
[01:45:36.790 --> 01:45:40.270]  that's a perfect name and then you type it in and it's there's two or three
[01:45:40.270 --> 01:45:47.110]  strains that have been named that oh yeah for sure it's like I ran into you
[01:45:47.110 --> 01:45:52.310]  know I you know I like my strain to the name to depict what it is so we had
[01:45:52.310 --> 01:45:58.750]  lemon sorbet and that's actually one of Leo strains from aficionado or
[01:45:58.750 --> 01:46:05.870]  aficionado variety lemon sorbet so we change it to loud lemon sorbet oh yeah
[01:46:05.870 --> 01:46:09.270]  you have to you have to get creative that the stromulon that I made which was
[01:46:09.270 --> 01:46:14.270]  uh I can't remember what I crossed and made that with now but it was Romulan
[01:46:14.270 --> 01:46:17.950]  and something else and it came out with a lot of strawberry flavor and a lot of
[01:46:17.950 --> 01:46:21.830]  the phenos and so I wanted to have you know I'm thinking strawberry Romulus too
[01:46:21.830 --> 01:46:25.190]  long right what are we gonna and we looked up all these things and
[01:46:25.190 --> 01:46:30.070]  everything we looked up was taken and I was like I'd screw it I'm just gonna
[01:46:30.070 --> 01:46:33.550]  call it stromulon yeah and someone someone laughed someone laughed in the
[01:46:33.550 --> 01:46:36.310]  room when they went it's just gonna like taste like hey and I was like I
[01:46:36.310 --> 01:46:41.990]  don't care what people think when they read it I'm trying to find a name we
[01:46:41.990 --> 01:46:44.590]  used to call it stromulon back in the day for whatever reason we always
[01:46:44.590 --> 01:46:50.910]  nicknamed stuff yeah yeah my friend Aaron he he like coming up with stuff
[01:46:50.910 --> 01:46:54.950]  but I was always something but it was stromulon was for sure a nickname that
[01:46:54.950 --> 01:47:00.350]  we use for Romulan that's funny it could have been something I even had
[01:47:00.350 --> 01:47:06.300]  heard in the past and forgot about yeah interesting
[01:47:06.300 --> 01:47:11.740]  strawberry Romulan is too long yeah that is too long I feel you strawberry
[01:47:11.740 --> 01:47:17.900]  Romulan is a little bit I mean each to their own you know yeah some people have
[01:47:17.900 --> 01:47:24.660]  no naming conventions they want to name them after race cars or celebrities so I
[01:47:24.660 --> 01:47:29.740]  did think of something that I do want to just discuss briefly because it's it's
[01:47:29.740 --> 01:47:33.820]  come up a few times again recently I dealt with it a lot in the past but I
[01:47:33.820 --> 01:47:38.620]  see a lot of people that are given the information that Romulan Joe is the guy
[01:47:38.620 --> 01:47:44.740]  who bred Romulan and he made it and it was only a clone cut and it's not around
[01:47:44.740 --> 01:47:48.100]  anymore so no one can have Romulan anymore it's impossible that what I have
[01:47:48.100 --> 01:47:53.100]  is is real Romulan and I've heard that from at least a few dozen people that
[01:47:53.100 --> 01:47:58.580]  will randomly chime in and I think you know and I think a lot of people that
[01:47:58.580 --> 01:48:01.820]  have been in the industry for a long time know that Romulan Joe didn't breed
[01:48:01.820 --> 01:48:07.460]  Romulan that he simply acquired a cut and there were a lot of different
[01:48:07.460 --> 01:48:10.660]  versions of what people called Romulan that kind of were put out at different
[01:48:10.660 --> 01:48:14.260]  points you know anywhere from things that stemmed from Federation seeds
[01:48:14.260 --> 01:48:21.700]  version which was really a cross not really pure Romulan to regional areas
[01:48:21.700 --> 01:48:25.620]  versions of it from you know Port Alberni pine buds versions and things
[01:48:25.620 --> 01:48:31.500]  that were closer down to Oregon but not a lot of people realize that Joe grew up
[01:48:31.500 --> 01:48:35.820]  in Southern California around where I grew up his family owned a nursery down
[01:48:35.820 --> 01:48:43.820]  there and when he decided to bring Romulan out to the public he moved all
[01:48:43.820 --> 01:48:51.060]  the way up to the border and changed the name of it to Romulan and at that same
[01:48:51.060 --> 01:48:54.460]  time there was another person that not many people know as much about named Vic
[01:48:54.580 --> 01:49:00.180]  High that also had a cut of what he knew was the same thing and they started
[01:49:00.180 --> 01:49:07.980]  calling it Romulan that he had acquired from someone in that area and so even at
[01:49:07.980 --> 01:49:12.380]  the time that the Romulan Joe's version Romulan was popular and getting sold in
[01:49:12.380 --> 01:49:16.860]  the compassion clubs in Canada and stuff as clones there was Vic High had his
[01:49:16.860 --> 01:49:24.580]  version to that he stated several times that what he had was pure and original
[01:49:24.580 --> 01:49:29.540]  and uncrossed and he kind of made this slight you know he alluded to the fact
[01:49:29.540 --> 01:49:33.900]  that what Joe had probably wasn't what Joe had was probably something that had
[01:49:33.900 --> 01:49:39.900]  been crossed with something and my I don't know if this is a hundred percent
[01:49:39.900 --> 01:49:46.020]  true but I do know that my dad knew Joe I remember him I remember going to this
[01:49:46.100 --> 01:49:50.180]  nursery when I was a kid I remember that guy being around and I do remember at
[01:49:50.180 --> 01:49:54.380]  one point there being some kind of conversation where I think what happened
[01:49:54.380 --> 01:49:57.260]  was Joe taught my dad and his buddies how to make clones because they didn't
[01:49:57.260 --> 01:50:00.900]  know how to do it until a certain point everything they did was they were
[01:50:00.900 --> 01:50:03.740]  planting seeds looking for this one plant and they'd kill everything else
[01:50:03.740 --> 01:50:06.860]  but then another you know what about time I was about five or six they were
[01:50:06.860 --> 01:50:11.660]  they had these little clones that they were keeping so I think he helped him
[01:50:11.660 --> 01:50:15.420]  make clones because they were running a nursery and clearly someone running a
[01:50:15.420 --> 01:50:19.260]  nursery would have you know the knowledge how to do stuff like that and
[01:50:19.260 --> 01:50:23.660]  what Joe ended up with was probably something that leaned more towards that
[01:50:23.660 --> 01:50:27.580]  Indica cross that those growers my dad and all of those different people
[01:50:27.580 --> 01:50:31.500]  growing this plant rejected they didn't like that outcome of it because
[01:50:31.500 --> 01:50:34.940]  everything that I've seen about Joe's Romulan when I smoked Romulan in the
[01:50:34.940 --> 01:50:40.460]  90s when I was younger it was the same taste but it was a little different than
[01:50:40.460 --> 01:50:47.020]  what dad had so that's been something that I've had to deal with over the
[01:50:47.020 --> 01:50:50.540]  years as people who have been given the knowledge that there was only one form
[01:50:50.540 --> 01:50:56.220]  of Romulan it was only Romulan Joe's and it was clone only and and it's not
[01:50:56.220 --> 01:51:02.460]  around anymore so no one could possibly have it the problem with that is if Joe
[01:51:02.460 --> 01:51:06.820]  created Romulan which we all know isn't true those of us who know it wouldn't be
[01:51:06.820 --> 01:51:12.980]  clone only especially for the time that it was made that that's I mean can you
[01:51:12.980 --> 01:51:18.300]  think of anything from 1990 or 89 that was clone only other than a specific
[01:51:18.300 --> 01:51:22.380]  Fino like Northern Lights number five or something everything was kind of made in
[01:51:22.380 --> 01:51:26.540]  seed form and it wasn't something that you only had a clone of so that that
[01:51:26.540 --> 01:51:32.660]  kind of doesn't really check out but what I've always kind of known is that
[01:51:32.660 --> 01:51:36.220]  whatever it was that Vic high had is probably very close to what my dad had
[01:51:36.220 --> 01:51:41.060]  if not the same thing and I've had a lot of people kind of vouch and verify
[01:51:41.060 --> 01:51:45.300]  it and they have said similar that clearly what you have isn't Joe's cut
[01:51:45.300 --> 01:51:49.680]  and I've said that all along it's not Joe's cut but it is more like what Vic
[01:51:49.680 --> 01:51:56.500]  I had and I just recently found out that before sub cool passed away that he had
[01:51:56.500 --> 01:52:01.540]  told badgers that his the cut that he had for years before he lost it in the
[01:52:01.540 --> 01:52:07.540]  fire is the exact same cut that I have now so that's something that I kind of
[01:52:07.540 --> 01:52:10.220]  wanted to get out there because I still do deal with people every now and then
[01:52:10.220 --> 01:52:14.580]  that are on this bandwagon things there's about a handful of haters out
[01:52:14.580 --> 01:52:17.140]  there that keep trying to spread the knowledge that I'm a fraud and what I
[01:52:17.140 --> 01:52:21.940]  have isn't real Romulan and so far that I've heard none of them that have saying
[01:52:21.940 --> 01:52:25.380]  they keep saying this have ever actually grown it or smoked it they're just
[01:52:25.380 --> 01:52:30.660]  hearing a story and looking at a picture and going oh he's fraud and I've had
[01:52:30.660 --> 01:52:34.420]  literally thousands of people and hundreds of people in the industry grow
[01:52:34.420 --> 01:52:41.220]  it and vouch for it and verify it so I just kind of want want that to get known
[01:52:41.220 --> 01:52:45.020]  to people that you know it wasn't a clone only plant that there were many
[01:52:45.020 --> 01:52:48.500]  many different versions that were available over the years just like just
[01:52:48.500 --> 01:52:53.300]  about just like everything else and Joe wasn't the guy who actually created it
[01:52:53.300 --> 01:52:57.100]  that it was a group of growers and it could have been anywhere from ten
[01:52:57.100 --> 01:53:00.320]  different guys to a lot more than that that actually worked on this and it may
[01:53:00.320 --> 01:53:04.280]  have only been four or five people but I know my dad was involved with it I
[01:53:04.280 --> 01:53:07.760]  know that there was at least two or three other main guys that were kind of
[01:53:07.760 --> 01:53:15.480]  doing the majority of the breeding nice yeah cannabis history is so interesting
[01:53:15.480 --> 01:53:20.440]  and it's we know so little about some of the stuff because it was illegal for one
[01:53:20.440 --> 01:53:24.360]  thing mm-hmm you know same thing there wasn't the the information in the
[01:53:24.360 --> 01:53:29.560]  internet and technology that we have now you know things would be a lot different
[01:53:29.640 --> 01:53:34.520]  but yeah interesting stories man really appreciate you coming on today yeah
[01:53:34.520 --> 01:53:38.520]  thanks for having me brother yeah we'll have to get together when I'm up your

[01:54:02.680 --> 01:54:07.600]  out and I don't know a hundred percent but I do know that there was more people
[01:54:07.600 --> 01:54:12.240]  emailing me than we had questions so we're probably not gonna be doing the
[01:54:12.240 --> 01:54:15.960]  giveaways on the show like we have been I am gonna send out and make sure
[01:54:15.960 --> 01:54:19.960]  everybody gets their seed giveaways you know next week we'll be sending

[01:54:23.880 --> 01:54:28.040]  participated and fortunately small group of people can ruin it for the majority

[01:57:36.160 --> 01:57:39.480]  Snoop I think it's great you know it's funny cuz I got some purple urkel that
[01:57:39.480 --> 01:57:43.000]  I'm breeding into some stuff right now too so I'll pitch it to those guys I'm
[01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:48.480]  sure but uh thank you know why not and we got you know we got the real urkel
[01:57:48.480 --> 01:57:52.840]  who's gonna pitch the purple oracle as a brand I think that's great what do you
[01:57:52.840 --> 01:58:00.520]  think Jake I think it's better than snoochie boochies this is true
[01:58:00.520 --> 01:58:08.640]  710 labs not snoop oh it's with 710 that's great yeah no I think the
[01:58:08.640 --> 01:58:12.120]  concepts good I mean bring an urkel back and purple oracle is a great
[01:58:12.120 --> 01:58:17.600]  strain it's an interesting breeding strain I think loud urkel you know I
[01:58:17.600 --> 01:58:22.120]  mean go ahead oh someone says I respect that
[01:58:22.120 --> 01:58:28.880]  urkel times urkel when I was in high school his I forget what school it was
[01:58:28.880 --> 01:58:32.480]  that he went to but his he played basketball for the high school team and
[01:58:32.480 --> 01:58:37.160]  he played at our school a couple times I got to meet him in person when he was
[01:58:37.200 --> 01:58:41.480]  kind of famous but he was still a normal person he was a really nice guy nice
[01:58:41.480 --> 01:58:47.960]  I'll say that about him and and ghost since you're in El Dorado go said
[01:58:47.960 --> 01:58:51.920]  everyone emailed John D'Agostini and tell him how much of a piece of shit he
[01:58:51.920 --> 01:59:06.760]  is I second that he is the sheriff in El Dorado County he is completely pulled a
[01:59:06.760 --> 01:59:11.800]  180 on us growers if people don't are unfamiliar with the situation here we
[01:59:11.800 --> 01:59:15.600]  went from kind of having some pretty nice freedom and being unspokenly
[01:59:15.600 --> 01:59:22.200]  protected to we're just screwed now yeah all things will change I think over time
[01:59:22.200 --> 01:59:29.360]  I hope I mean so my idea was to in the next time he runs for a sheriff to put
[01:59:29.360 --> 01:59:34.640]  someone up against him and and give that I mean a massive war chest for that
[01:59:34.640 --> 01:59:39.840]  campaign would probably be like $10,000 like I don't know what it but it's not
[01:59:39.840 --> 01:59:46.760]  like an insurmountable number so I thought it'd be cool to if you guys in
[01:59:46.760 --> 01:59:53.080]  El Dorado could find a sheriff candidate we should do that yeah and we should
[01:59:53.080 --> 01:59:56.440]  definitely do that rest of us will help raise some money to I mean we could do a
[01:59:56.440 --> 02:00:01.160]  whole social media I mean I think we're a little more digitally savvy than John
[02:00:01.160 --> 02:00:30.840]  D'Agostino so probably get Urkel to run we can get Urkel to run up against this town. I don't I don't know that that would work very well in this town but I hope I hope it would. Could you imagine him in full like cop costume and Urkel costume? I would be better than Steven Seagal I would I would pay a lot of money to see that shit yeah seriously it's like some super trooper style we we raised
[02:00:31.120 --> 02:00:37.520]  we raised money for this guy Christian Carter who's still in jail for his legal
[02:00:37.520 --> 02:00:45.000]  defense that's still going on I talked to Ashley who's his lawyer a couple times a
[02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:51.800]  week and then I think Tuesday night we're gonna do a fundraiser for Phoebe from
[02:00:51.800 --> 02:00:59.800]  the Emerald Cup who got in a serious car accident yeah I believe on Friday
[02:00:59.800 --> 02:01:06.160]  it has no medical insurance yeah right yeah there's a GoFundMe actually if you
[02:01:06.160 --> 02:01:11.920]  look on Julie a skunk magazine I think is featuring it too but uh yeah it's
[02:01:11.920 --> 02:01:15.320]  really sad she's they're trying to raise $100,000 she got yeah she's going
[02:01:15.320 --> 02:01:19.920]  through multiple surgeries and yeah really rough got hit off the 101 it
[02:01:19.920 --> 02:01:26.000]  sounds like in the daytime I guess somewhere where accidents happen all the
[02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:30.400]  time so it wasn't like a drunk driver are you in South Central Peter I thought
[02:01:30.400 --> 02:01:33.760]  that was one of you now that's not me that's how that was that was that was me
[02:01:33.760 --> 02:01:38.000]  here nice we got a big fire station right by our house we get ambulances go
[02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.960]  by all the time sheriffs are coming to get you already
[02:01:40.960 --> 02:01:50.600]  I hope not yeah that's not gonna happen that's I like that at the bottom there
[02:01:50.600 --> 02:01:55.080]  James Ludd for sheriff let's do it yeah I think I think you'd look good in a
[02:01:55.080 --> 02:02:04.680]  sheriff uniform James yeah people say good stuff guys well thanks again for
