[00:00.000 --> 00:00.840]  Exactly.
[00:02.260 --> 00:03.100]  All right.
[00:03.100 --> 00:04.200]  And we are live.
[00:04.200 --> 00:06.600]  Happy 420 everyone.
[00:06.600 --> 00:08.520]  Happy 420.
[00:08.520 --> 00:12.160]  I guess it's almost like you have to do something on 420.
[00:12.160 --> 00:14.160]  So here we are today.
[00:14.160 --> 00:19.000]  We're talking with a man who has a passion for haze.
[00:19.000 --> 00:20.660]  Would that be an accurate statement?
[00:20.660 --> 00:21.920]  Yes, it would.
[00:21.920 --> 00:22.760]  Yes, it would.
[00:22.760 --> 00:23.600]  Yes.
[00:23.600 --> 00:24.960]  I love that stuff.
[00:24.960 --> 00:26.560]  And it goes way back with me.
[00:26.560 --> 00:28.920]  I was smoking it before I knew it was haze.
[00:28.920 --> 00:30.720]  It was called old man weed
[00:30.720 --> 00:33.680]  when we were getting it a long time ago.
[00:33.680 --> 00:36.080]  It was later on I found out that it was actually haze
[00:36.080 --> 00:36.920]  and all of this.
[00:36.920 --> 00:38.600]  So yeah.
[00:38.600 --> 00:39.440]  The old man weed.
[00:39.440 --> 00:41.040]  I'm a big fan of the old man weed.
[00:41.040 --> 00:45.680]  There's, you know what, I'm embracing old man-ness
[00:45.680 --> 00:48.240]  and all its forms.
[00:48.240 --> 00:49.080]  So.
[00:49.080 --> 00:49.900]  Yeah.
[00:49.900 --> 00:52.360]  Well, it's stuff that you can accomplish things on.
[00:52.360 --> 00:54.600]  You know, it doesn't ruin your day.
[00:54.600 --> 00:57.880]  It's not that you smoke a joint and that's it, you're done.
[00:58.480 --> 01:02.440]  You can accomplish goals.
[01:02.440 --> 01:04.760]  So I've noticed that a lot of the breeders,
[01:04.760 --> 01:07.360]  they talk about their favorite stuff as sativas too.
[01:07.360 --> 01:10.000]  And I think it's probably for that same reason
[01:10.000 --> 01:12.420]  because you can still think.
[01:14.280 --> 01:15.120]  All right.
[01:15.120 --> 01:16.440]  So.
[01:16.440 --> 01:18.560]  So let's go way back.
[01:18.560 --> 01:21.880]  I mean, you want to kind of introduce yourself
[01:21.880 --> 01:24.800]  and talk about, remember,
[01:24.800 --> 01:27.280]  however much geography you want to.
[01:28.120 --> 01:28.960]  Give away.
[01:29.880 --> 01:32.120]  And then kind of like when you started smoking
[01:32.120 --> 01:34.440]  and, you know, obviously the old man weed
[01:34.440 --> 01:37.320]  is what you were smoking in the early days.
[01:38.480 --> 01:39.320]  Yeah.
[01:39.320 --> 01:40.160]  Okay.
[01:40.160 --> 01:42.120]  Well, it's like most people start smoking in high school,
[01:42.120 --> 01:45.160]  you know, and then you get what you can back then.
[01:45.160 --> 01:47.800]  And you find out that there's good weed around,
[01:47.800 --> 01:49.760]  but you don't have access to it.
[01:49.760 --> 01:52.600]  So it kind of makes you want it even more and all of that.
[01:52.600 --> 01:55.260]  So that's when you want to start growing
[01:55.260 --> 01:58.020]  and finding your own people that know
[01:58.020 --> 02:00.380]  where the good stuff is and can get it occasionally.
[02:00.380 --> 02:05.380]  So, and I don't know, it's that old man weed,
[02:05.940 --> 02:08.300]  that's all it was ever called.
[02:08.300 --> 02:09.460]  This is the old man weed.
[02:09.460 --> 02:12.900]  And it was pretty consistent every time it came around.
[02:12.900 --> 02:14.700]  And it wasn't until later on,
[02:14.700 --> 02:17.820]  it was the name came from my friend.
[02:17.820 --> 02:20.820]  It was, he got it from his dad, his old man.
[02:20.820 --> 02:24.420]  So that's how that name started.
[02:24.420 --> 02:27.740]  But later on, I found out that it was NL Hayes
[02:27.740 --> 02:29.260]  or Hayes NL, which one,
[02:29.260 --> 02:34.260]  I don't know if it was the NL5 Hayes or the NL1 Hayes,
[02:34.820 --> 02:37.220]  but that's what it supposedly was.
[02:37.220 --> 02:39.100]  And, you know, later on you find out,
[02:39.100 --> 02:41.780]  smoke other stuff that has more credentials to it.
[02:41.780 --> 02:44.020]  And yeah, that seems about right.
[02:44.020 --> 02:47.300]  So I started off on that and like Mexican brick weed
[02:47.300 --> 02:49.020]  and Beesters and that bullshit.
[02:49.020 --> 02:52.820]  And so, and like I said, that just gives you a drive
[02:52.860 --> 02:55.300]  that you want the good stuff around all the time.
[02:55.300 --> 02:57.100]  So, and you eventually find out
[02:57.100 --> 02:58.760]  you got to do that on your own.
[03:01.700 --> 03:06.020]  So that's where my love for the Hayes started.
[03:06.020 --> 03:09.340]  And this is all happening, let's just say in the Midwest,
[03:09.340 --> 03:12.180]  the Ohio Valley area of the country.
[03:12.180 --> 03:15.540]  And, you know, it's not really on the weed map,
[03:15.540 --> 03:18.140]  but there's a lot of good stuff around.
[03:18.140 --> 03:19.780]  It's Ohio in particular,
[03:19.780 --> 03:21.780]  because of all the colleges there and everything.
[03:21.780 --> 03:25.480]  There's like some stuff that,
[03:27.220 --> 03:28.840]  it has a name in certain places.
[03:28.840 --> 03:31.960]  Like I've seen dumpster mentioned on here several times
[03:31.960 --> 03:33.460]  and that's an Ohio thing.
[03:33.460 --> 03:35.340]  And there's several of them.
[03:35.340 --> 03:40.340]  And so there's Ohio, Tennessee, Kentucky, Virginia.
[03:42.000 --> 03:43.860]  Yeah, there's a lot of good weed
[03:43.860 --> 03:44.860]  in that area of the country.
[03:44.860 --> 03:45.920]  It's just not famous.
[03:45.920 --> 03:48.540]  It doesn't have OG or cookies
[03:48.540 --> 03:50.740]  or some crap like that attached to it.
[03:50.740 --> 03:52.300]  And it's not named after candy.
[03:52.300 --> 03:55.820]  It's got names like dumpster and skunk.
[03:55.820 --> 03:57.460]  And it's not called the roadkill skunk.
[03:57.460 --> 03:59.020]  It's just the skunk.
[03:59.020 --> 03:59.860]  So.
[04:00.740 --> 04:01.580]  Well, all right.
[04:01.580 --> 04:04.220]  So let's go back because I mean, 20 years ago,
[04:04.220 --> 04:07.820]  nothing had the dessert and the fruit name.
[04:07.820 --> 04:11.020]  So give us a, can you,
[04:11.020 --> 04:13.440]  I want to tease out a longer history lesson
[04:13.440 --> 04:16.860]  of kind of regional cultivation and the scene
[04:16.860 --> 04:19.580]  and kind of what was going on.
[04:20.460 --> 04:21.620]  Should we call it the, what is it?
[04:21.620 --> 04:22.860]  The Ohio Valley?
[04:22.860 --> 04:25.700]  Yeah, the Ohio Valley is that's,
[04:25.700 --> 04:27.500]  let's just put it that way.
[04:27.500 --> 04:32.500]  And basically you didn't talk about it.
[04:33.980 --> 04:36.100]  And a lot of people still don't.
[04:36.100 --> 04:38.460]  It's not, you know, it's not an open thing
[04:38.460 --> 04:40.280]  and you've got to, you kind of got to get in
[04:40.280 --> 04:41.260]  and prove yourself.
[04:41.260 --> 04:43.580]  And the way that I did it, I got in kind of young
[04:43.580 --> 04:48.420]  and I grew a silly mushrooms before I got in on the weed
[04:48.420 --> 04:49.620]  because I wasn't allowed to.
[04:49.620 --> 04:52.100]  There was like other people in the family doing that stuff.
[04:52.100 --> 04:54.420]  And some young whippersnapper comes along
[04:54.420 --> 04:56.420]  and starts stinking up the place
[04:56.420 --> 04:58.460]  that causes problems for the older folks.
[04:58.460 --> 05:01.220]  So yeah, I started off with that
[05:01.220 --> 05:05.060]  and I made a lot of my connections through that.
[05:05.060 --> 05:06.860]  Oh man, sirens, that's a bad thing to hear.
[05:06.860 --> 05:08.380]  It's not coming from this end.
[05:09.380 --> 05:10.220]  All right.
[05:10.220 --> 05:14.780]  Anyway, so the, just nobody really talked about it
[05:14.780 --> 05:18.140]  until you got in and people started to trust you and stuff.
[05:18.780 --> 05:19.620]  Is it really?
[05:20.980 --> 05:24.300]  Yeah, that area there, just in the valley part of it.
[05:24.300 --> 05:27.500]  So I see North Carolina, I see Indiana.
[05:27.500 --> 05:30.100]  Not Indiana, Indiana is dangerous.
[05:31.060 --> 05:34.100]  Indiana is very dangerous, but I'm sure people do it there
[05:34.100 --> 05:35.340]  but I don't know any of those guys.
[05:35.340 --> 05:38.380]  The Ohio, Kentucky, Central Kentucky,
[05:38.380 --> 05:40.140]  the Tennessee Valley a little bit
[05:40.140 --> 05:43.020]  and then West Virginia and Virginia
[05:43.020 --> 05:44.940]  and those mountains right there.
[05:44.940 --> 05:47.220]  There's a lot of really good stuff growing there.
[05:47.220 --> 05:49.380]  That's where the skunk that everybody's looking for
[05:49.380 --> 05:50.220]  is growing.
[05:51.140 --> 05:53.180]  I guarantee it, it's still there.
[05:53.180 --> 05:55.940]  So that's, if you're looking for that
[05:55.940 --> 05:58.380]  so-called roadkill skunk, that's where it lives
[05:58.380 --> 06:00.020]  because that's where the skunks live
[06:00.020 --> 06:02.780]  and you can't differentiate between a dead skunk
[06:02.780 --> 06:04.100]  and the roadkill.
[06:04.100 --> 06:07.220]  So it's, but like I said, it's not called roadkill there.
[06:07.220 --> 06:09.060]  It's just called the skunk.
[06:09.060 --> 06:10.100]  They're gonna look at you funny
[06:10.100 --> 06:11.900]  if you call it roadkill skunk there.
[06:11.900 --> 06:13.700]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[06:13.700 --> 06:14.860]  But yeah.
[06:14.860 --> 06:15.700]  So, yeah.
[06:18.820 --> 06:20.820]  Yeah, it's a beautiful part of the country too.
[06:20.820 --> 06:25.100]  It's along the same latitudes as like Afghanistan
[06:25.100 --> 06:26.820]  and Humboldt and all of those places.
[06:26.820 --> 06:29.540]  It's just one of those sweet, sweet spots.
[06:29.540 --> 06:31.860]  During the war, they grew hemp there.
[06:31.860 --> 06:34.980]  Like my grandfather grew hemp for the war effort
[06:34.980 --> 06:38.340]  back in the forties and probably before that.
[06:38.340 --> 06:39.780]  But the one that I know of is that
[06:39.780 --> 06:41.380]  he definitely grew it for World War II
[06:41.380 --> 06:42.900]  but they grew it for World War I too.
[06:42.940 --> 06:45.020]  I don't know if he was involved with that.
[06:45.020 --> 06:47.380]  And did he ramp up production?
[06:47.380 --> 06:49.820]  Like, was there kind of a call to action?
[06:49.820 --> 06:52.100]  Like, you know, we need more hemp
[06:52.100 --> 06:54.660]  and anybody who can grow it, get out there
[06:54.660 --> 06:57.900]  and, you know, triple your production.
[06:57.900 --> 07:00.180]  Yeah, my grandmother said that they encouraged it
[07:00.180 --> 07:01.580]  is that they were encouraging it
[07:01.580 --> 07:02.900]  because they needed that fiber.
[07:02.900 --> 07:04.820]  So they got free seeds.
[07:04.820 --> 07:06.220]  Like they were tobacco farmers
[07:06.220 --> 07:07.620]  and they had like a huge garden
[07:07.620 --> 07:10.660]  and animals and all of this stuff, the self-sustaining.
[07:10.660 --> 07:12.060]  I remember my aunt telling me
[07:12.060 --> 07:14.060]  that she went through the great depression
[07:14.060 --> 07:15.740]  and didn't even know that it happened.
[07:15.740 --> 07:18.100]  Like the only thing that she missed was like sugar
[07:18.100 --> 07:20.140]  and coffee and stuff like that.
[07:20.140 --> 07:22.140]  That was the only things that they would go to town for.
[07:22.140 --> 07:24.220]  Everything else that they would do on their own
[07:24.220 --> 07:26.620]  and make it like my grandmother made her own soap
[07:26.620 --> 07:28.340]  until the day she died.
[07:28.340 --> 07:31.300]  It's, yeah, it's a very beautiful part.
[07:31.300 --> 07:33.300]  We have Hatchville, North Carolina in the house.
[07:33.300 --> 07:34.660]  There you go, yeah.
[07:36.380 --> 07:37.340]  So some of these people,
[07:37.340 --> 07:39.060]  they may know what I'm talking about.
[07:39.060 --> 07:41.300]  It's not all OGs out in California.
[07:41.300 --> 07:42.340]  That's the good stuff.
[07:42.340 --> 07:45.820]  There's different tastes too.
[07:45.820 --> 07:47.540]  As everybody's got their own thing
[07:47.540 --> 07:50.980]  and the South is known, South, Midwest,
[07:50.980 --> 07:53.880]  it's known for being a little bit slower and laid back.
[07:53.880 --> 07:56.100]  So you can kind of expect that from the weed too.
[07:56.100 --> 07:58.660]  It's just kind of, you notice that going around the country
[07:58.660 --> 08:01.300]  in the Northeast, things are a little bit more speedy.
[08:02.460 --> 08:03.760]  We have our crack.
[08:03.760 --> 08:04.600]  Yeah.
[08:04.600 --> 08:05.440]  Yeah.
[08:06.400 --> 08:07.760]  So, okay.
[08:07.760 --> 08:09.160]  Is that enough history or?
[08:09.160 --> 08:10.000]  Well, no, no, no.
[08:10.000 --> 08:13.680]  I wanna talk about the,
[08:13.680 --> 08:17.480]  so the government sent hemp seeds out to everybody
[08:17.480 --> 08:19.800]  who was willing to grow it.
[08:19.800 --> 08:22.360]  Is that where your grandparents got the seeds from?
[08:22.360 --> 08:23.460]  I mean, that's amazing.
[08:23.460 --> 08:24.920]  Yes, back then,
[08:24.920 --> 08:27.800]  and it was only in the regions where it would grow well.
[08:27.800 --> 08:29.640]  And that's why there's feral hemp in Missouri
[08:29.640 --> 08:30.960]  and all that stuff there.
[08:30.960 --> 08:32.080]  But they would like,
[08:33.080 --> 08:36.480]  like have somebody like at the feed stores
[08:36.480 --> 08:38.520]  and the feed store person was basically
[08:38.520 --> 08:41.280]  the one telling the government official is like,
[08:41.280 --> 08:44.080]  this is the guy you need to talk to.
[08:44.080 --> 08:45.440]  He's got this much land.
[08:45.440 --> 08:48.600]  He's got, and it's like, you had to have adequate water.
[08:48.600 --> 08:51.880]  And there was criteria supposedly,
[08:51.880 --> 08:54.220]  but I learned all of this from my grandmother and my aunt.
[08:54.220 --> 08:55.720]  I never met my grandpa.
[08:55.720 --> 08:57.680]  This is all stories from them.
[08:57.680 --> 08:59.480]  But granny, she was really cool.
[09:00.080 --> 09:04.240]  And this, she, I come from a very open-minded family.
[09:04.240 --> 09:06.400]  There's a lot of closed-minded people in this area.
[09:06.400 --> 09:08.680]  And that's a lot of that comes from religion,
[09:08.680 --> 09:13.020]  but I don't see why, but it seems to go hand in hand.
[09:14.800 --> 09:18.400]  That I grew up in Dover, Massachusetts.
[09:18.400 --> 09:21.440]  Okay, so you know all about that fast paced,
[09:21.440 --> 09:23.440]  speedy stuff, right?
[09:23.440 --> 09:24.840]  Well, I grew up in farm country.
[09:24.840 --> 09:27.760]  So, I mean, Dover is probably more,
[09:27.760 --> 09:29.640]  I mean, it's more gentrified now,
[09:29.640 --> 09:31.080]  but I mean, when I grew up,
[09:31.080 --> 09:35.360]  we had hundreds and hundreds of miles
[09:35.360 --> 09:37.360]  of bridle paths behind my house
[09:37.360 --> 09:41.240]  and all the neighbors had horses and cows.
[09:44.240 --> 09:46.800]  Yeah, I know a little bit about all that stuff too.
[09:46.800 --> 09:48.160]  There's a lot of animals around here.
[09:48.160 --> 09:50.120]  I'm surrounded by cattle farms.
[09:50.120 --> 09:54.000]  That's one of the reasons I'm able to do what I do.
[09:54.000 --> 09:56.240]  But these guys, breeding cattle
[09:56.560 --> 09:58.000]  and talking to them about that stuff.
[09:58.000 --> 09:59.600]  And it's very interesting.
[09:59.600 --> 10:02.240]  Chicken farmers, like the chickens,
[10:02.240 --> 10:05.920]  their chromosomes are different than ours.
[10:05.920 --> 10:09.480]  Like they have WZ chromosomes.
[10:09.480 --> 10:12.480]  And the male is the larger chromosome
[10:12.480 --> 10:15.340]  as in our species and cannabis, it's the Y.
[10:17.000 --> 10:19.480]  So, the X, sorry.
[10:20.840 --> 10:21.680]  Right.
[10:21.680 --> 10:23.640]  Yeah, so the X chromosome is much larger,
[10:23.640 --> 10:27.840]  but in chickens and poultry, ducks and stuff like that,
[10:27.840 --> 10:31.100]  and lizards, because they're essentially dinosaurs.
[10:31.100 --> 10:34.960]  But the chicken chromosome, it's different
[10:34.960 --> 10:37.960]  and it's switched, like the dominant chromosome.
[10:37.960 --> 10:40.160]  I don't know what it's called.
[10:40.160 --> 10:42.600]  It's not like our mitochondrial DNA.
[10:42.600 --> 10:44.840]  It's whatever the hell they have.
[10:44.840 --> 10:47.640]  But anyway, you learn stuff like that from chicken farmers
[10:47.640 --> 10:49.400]  or chicken breeders and stuff like that.
[10:49.400 --> 10:50.240]  Well, that's my question.
[10:50.240 --> 10:52.260]  Are you talking breeding with these guys?
[10:52.260 --> 10:54.540]  Are you like peppering them with questions?
[10:54.540 --> 10:56.980]  Yes, but I have to be clever about it.
[10:56.980 --> 10:59.340]  It's like, I basically just come at it dumb
[10:59.340 --> 11:00.740]  and I don't know anything about it.
[11:00.740 --> 11:03.100]  I'm just like, yeah, I just question them
[11:03.100 --> 11:04.380]  whenever I have the chance.
[11:04.380 --> 11:06.700]  And you can't just come out of the blue
[11:06.700 --> 11:08.540]  with some crazy ass question.
[11:08.540 --> 11:09.460]  Look at you funny man.
[11:09.460 --> 11:11.500]  You gotta watch how you talk to farmers.
[11:11.500 --> 11:13.780]  And is there still like,
[11:15.060 --> 11:17.340]  obviously there's like the Purdue's
[11:17.340 --> 11:20.120]  and the mega factory chicken world.
[11:20.120 --> 11:23.320]  Are your neighbors all operating in kind of like
[11:23.320 --> 11:27.960]  the equivalent of craft mom and pop chicken farms?
[11:27.960 --> 11:30.340]  Yes, the chicken guys, definitely.
[11:30.340 --> 11:33.200]  And the cattle guys, like the guy across the street
[11:33.200 --> 11:36.120]  and most of the land that surrounds me,
[11:36.120 --> 11:40.320]  he is like old school, cool, cool.
[11:40.320 --> 11:42.760]  Like just everything's natural.
[11:42.760 --> 11:44.560]  And then I've got one side of me
[11:44.560 --> 11:47.160]  that's like a commercial operation that does.
[11:47.680 --> 11:48.520]  The YY.
[11:51.920 --> 11:55.000]  So Mr. Two, by the way, if you're down for it,
[11:55.000 --> 11:56.520]  we're gonna bring you on a little later.
[11:56.520 --> 11:58.280]  We're gonna start talking hazes
[11:58.280 --> 12:00.680]  and then you know a thing or two about hazes.
[12:00.680 --> 12:02.600]  So I thought it'd be cool to bring you on.
[12:02.600 --> 12:04.560]  Yes, and he knows about pure hazes.
[12:04.560 --> 12:06.840]  Like all the hazes that I know have been outcrossed.
[12:06.840 --> 12:08.440]  So his thing is like,
[12:08.440 --> 12:10.400]  I got some questions for him actually.
[12:10.400 --> 12:11.240]  So yeah, I'd love to talk to him.
[12:11.240 --> 12:14.440]  I'm actually shipping up an order right now of
[12:15.400 --> 12:16.240]  There you go.
[12:16.240 --> 12:20.720]  44 D's and some freebie broken bones right now.
[12:20.720 --> 12:24.200]  And yeah, I thought I was gonna be able to multitask.
[12:25.440 --> 12:30.440]  So someone ordered the T-shirt and some bone yard.
[12:31.320 --> 12:34.520]  And I thought I could like pack shit up and talk shop.
[12:34.520 --> 12:36.840]  But I realized, this is why I love having conversations
[12:36.840 --> 12:37.840]  where there are a bunch of people.
[12:37.840 --> 12:39.960]  So I can kind of like disappear
[12:39.960 --> 12:41.840]  and do my thing while they talk.
[12:42.680 --> 12:45.120]  Yeah, well I can ramble about that haze for quite a while.
[12:45.120 --> 12:46.640]  I love that stuff.
[12:46.640 --> 12:47.880]  I know I've got experience
[12:47.880 --> 12:49.280]  with a bunch of different ones too.
[12:49.280 --> 12:52.800]  So it's like, I didn't even send you everything that I have.
[12:52.800 --> 12:55.560]  Like I had this one that I almost lost.
[12:55.560 --> 12:56.960]  I told you about my situation
[12:56.960 --> 12:59.080]  in September, October and everything.
[12:59.080 --> 13:00.760]  Well, I almost lost one of them.
[13:00.760 --> 13:03.080]  Like the one that I grew up smoking.
[13:03.080 --> 13:05.320]  And if it wasn't, I'm gonna shout this guy out right now.
[13:05.320 --> 13:07.520]  But if it wasn't for Comfrey Bogart,
[13:07.520 --> 13:09.080]  I wouldn't have that stuff back.
[13:09.080 --> 13:11.000]  So hey, thank you, dude.
[13:11.000 --> 13:12.320]  Thank you very much.
[13:12.320 --> 13:14.200]  But that's why you give stuff out
[13:14.200 --> 13:15.960]  is because somebody will return the favor
[13:15.960 --> 13:17.480]  and give it back to you.
[13:17.480 --> 13:18.840]  And he hadn't popped any of them.
[13:18.840 --> 13:20.440]  It was just like I handed it to him.
[13:20.440 --> 13:22.040]  Very cool.
[13:22.040 --> 13:24.600]  Yeah, Tom McCormick, man, he's a wealth of knowledge.
[13:24.600 --> 13:25.760]  So is Mr. Toad.
[13:27.040 --> 13:29.280]  So I'd like to talk about that.
[13:29.280 --> 13:32.200]  I guess he's saying that in the Y,
[13:32.200 --> 13:34.000]  it's like bound up tighter
[13:34.000 --> 13:37.600]  and there's like more information in that smaller area.
[13:37.600 --> 13:38.440]  Is that what he's?
[13:39.400 --> 13:43.640]  Well, yeah, we'll bring him on to clarify.
[13:43.640 --> 13:44.960]  He can draw.
[13:44.960 --> 13:46.480]  Yeah, that's what that looks like to me
[13:46.480 --> 13:48.360]  is that there's a little bit more information
[13:48.360 --> 13:50.680]  is just tightly wound in there.
[13:50.680 --> 13:51.560]  All right, so yeah.
[13:51.560 --> 13:52.720]  Let me read about Hayes
[13:52.720 --> 13:53.560]  and then I'll ask him a bunch of questions.
[13:53.560 --> 13:54.520]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[13:54.520 --> 13:56.760]  I don't wanna jump right into cannabis.
[13:56.760 --> 13:59.360]  I wanna talk about other crops and animals.
[13:59.360 --> 14:02.960]  So I wanna talk about chickens, tobacco,
[14:02.960 --> 14:06.720]  cause you're, you know a thing or two about tobacco
[14:06.760 --> 14:08.680]  or at least family wise, right?
[14:08.680 --> 14:09.520]  Yes.
[14:09.520 --> 14:13.120]  So I think one thing I find interesting
[14:13.120 --> 14:14.400]  and correct me if I'm wrong,
[14:14.400 --> 14:19.400]  but like my assumption is the big cigarette companies
[14:21.200 --> 14:25.680]  kind of, they probably have just a couple varieties
[14:25.680 --> 14:29.320]  of tobacco that they grow at massive scale.
[14:29.320 --> 14:32.760]  That's not necessarily the tastiest.
[14:32.760 --> 14:35.160]  Like if you were just growing for yourself,
[14:35.200 --> 14:37.120]  you probably wouldn't pick those cultivars.
[14:37.120 --> 14:39.360]  And I assume with chickens, it's the same thing
[14:39.360 --> 14:43.680]  where like Purdue has the chickens that will get super big
[14:43.680 --> 14:48.680]  and fat and tasteless in a chicken city.
[14:49.760 --> 14:53.840]  And so can you talk about in your region
[14:53.840 --> 14:58.840]  kind of what you're seeing people breed directionally
[14:59.240 --> 15:01.680]  like for, and kind of just talk about some
[15:01.680 --> 15:06.680]  of the tobacco varietals and the chickens and the cows.
[15:07.720 --> 15:10.320]  Okay, so which one of those you want me to talk about first?
[15:10.320 --> 15:13.080]  Cause you also sent me like tomato seeds, right?
[15:13.080 --> 15:13.920]  Yeah, yeah.
[15:13.920 --> 15:17.680]  And basil, which I'm gonna start all that stuff
[15:17.680 --> 15:18.880]  in the next week or so.
[15:18.880 --> 15:21.120]  How'd you like the smell on that basil, man?
[15:21.120 --> 15:22.320]  I was great.
[15:22.320 --> 15:23.160]  Yeah.
[15:23.160 --> 15:24.000]  I'm excited.
[15:24.000 --> 15:29.000]  I have so much, I just did a whole wave of like daikon
[15:29.520 --> 15:31.560]  and all these different Chinese vegetables.
[15:32.440 --> 15:33.280]  My wife's Chinese.
[15:33.280 --> 15:36.640]  So I figured it would be a home crowd pleaser
[15:36.640 --> 15:40.040]  to satisfy the Asian vegetable.
[15:40.920 --> 15:43.320]  Cause like her parents live a mile away from us.
[15:43.320 --> 15:44.760]  So we always eat dinners together.
[15:44.760 --> 15:47.420]  So I have like all these Asian vegetables going.
[15:49.240 --> 15:50.920]  Those daikons are good, man.
[15:50.920 --> 15:52.600]  I love those daikon radishes.
[15:54.040 --> 15:56.560]  Yeah, actually let me, so talk about that.
[15:56.560 --> 15:58.440]  I'm actually gonna pull up a picture of Gemma
[15:58.960 --> 15:59.800]  when we pull it.
[15:59.800 --> 16:04.800]  So I had one go to seed and it just kept going.
[16:06.880 --> 16:11.880]  Like it grew out its pods and then I was like,
[16:12.080 --> 16:13.840]  okay, it's almost done.
[16:13.840 --> 16:16.840]  And then like a new wave of flowers popped out
[16:16.840 --> 16:21.840]  and more like it just kept, the pods kept coming for months,
[16:22.660 --> 16:24.260]  like two and a half months.
[16:24.260 --> 16:26.340]  And I just, finally I was just like, all right,
[16:26.340 --> 16:27.280]  I'm just gonna pull this thing.
[16:27.280 --> 16:28.800]  Cause I have all these new ones coming in.
[16:28.800 --> 16:33.800]  But so why don't you talk just kind of what you're,
[16:35.800 --> 16:37.280]  we're gonna get to cannabis next,
[16:37.280 --> 16:39.280]  but other vegetables and animals,
[16:39.280 --> 16:42.240]  what you're growing and breeding and excited about,
[16:42.240 --> 16:45.160]  and then kind of what the neighbors are doing
[16:45.160 --> 16:46.960]  with whatever they're focused on.
[16:48.240 --> 16:50.260]  Okay, so with chickens,
[16:50.260 --> 16:52.840]  people select for either meat or eggs.
[16:52.840 --> 16:54.840]  As they're dual purpose birds
[16:54.840 --> 16:57.560]  really don't do very well for either one.
[16:57.560 --> 16:59.080]  And I've noticed over time,
[16:59.080 --> 17:02.080]  I don't throw a chicken away.
[17:02.080 --> 17:06.000]  After it's done producing eggs, or if it fucks up,
[17:06.000 --> 17:08.320]  if it's like a rooster that's violent or something,
[17:08.320 --> 17:10.640]  I just kill it and process it and eat it.
[17:10.640 --> 17:12.920]  And I've done a bunch of different type of birds,
[17:12.920 --> 17:15.960]  either egg or meat birds.
[17:15.960 --> 17:19.160]  And you notice that the structure is different on them.
[17:19.160 --> 17:20.640]  And that's what they're selecting for
[17:20.640 --> 17:22.520]  is that different structure.
[17:22.720 --> 17:24.680]  With the, hey, what's up Magma?
[17:25.680 --> 17:29.720]  With the birds that are for meat,
[17:29.720 --> 17:32.720]  it's basically just all for the breast meat.
[17:32.720 --> 17:36.760]  So their chests, their bone structure is different in there.
[17:36.760 --> 17:40.680]  And some of them you find they don't even have a wishbone,
[17:40.680 --> 17:42.420]  like they bred the wishbone away.
[17:43.680 --> 17:48.680]  Then also, yeah, big titties, breeding for big titties.
[17:48.680 --> 17:50.240]  Breeding for big titties.
[17:50.240 --> 17:55.240]  But they breed out specific things.
[17:56.360 --> 18:00.280]  And then I've also noticed that the opposite.
[18:00.280 --> 18:02.760]  I've found double wishbones.
[18:02.760 --> 18:05.720]  They're kind of like a suspension in an old vehicle.
[18:05.720 --> 18:10.720]  But they would breed away
[18:10.840 --> 18:14.180]  from all of that extra meat in the chest
[18:14.180 --> 18:17.840]  and save room in the gut so that they can produce more eggs.
[18:18.040 --> 18:21.440]  I've run ISAs and that's supposed to be
[18:21.440 --> 18:22.960]  the best egger there is.
[18:22.960 --> 18:24.960]  So we've got a nice little flock of those.
[18:24.960 --> 18:29.960]  And I've got a Rhode Island red rooster and hen too.
[18:32.080 --> 18:34.200]  And they mix in with those ISAs as well
[18:34.200 --> 18:38.320]  because birds of a feather is actually real.
[18:39.720 --> 18:43.580]  Birds will fight with other birds of a different feather
[18:43.580 --> 18:44.420]  in a lot of cases.
[18:44.420 --> 18:47.900]  That's not always true, but it happens most of the time.
[18:47.900 --> 18:52.140]  And the ISA is a Rhode Island red
[18:52.140 --> 18:54.300]  and Rhode Island white hybrid
[18:54.300 --> 18:57.080]  that they've been making over in France for a long time.
[18:57.080 --> 19:00.980]  And they keep introducing that Rhode Island white
[19:00.980 --> 19:03.620]  every so often to replenish the gene
[19:03.620 --> 19:06.740]  so it doesn't get all inbred and fucked up.
[19:06.740 --> 19:10.020]  So those ISAs are egg birds.
[19:10.020 --> 19:14.960]  And I make barbecue out of them, out of the spent hens
[19:14.960 --> 19:17.860]  because the spent hens get tough.
[19:17.860 --> 19:19.860]  So you've got to like boil them in vinegar
[19:19.860 --> 19:22.060]  and loosen that meat up and make a barbecue
[19:22.060 --> 19:24.340]  or you can make other dishes out of them too.
[19:24.340 --> 19:29.340]  But yeah, so there's the chicken thing, tobacco.
[19:29.420 --> 19:31.740]  Tobacco, the commercial tobaccos
[19:31.740 --> 19:34.820]  are several different varieties that they grow.
[19:34.820 --> 19:36.660]  And they're all like basically bred
[19:36.660 --> 19:40.540]  for disease resistance and large leaves.
[19:40.540 --> 19:45.340]  And they also like impart different things into the blend.
[19:45.340 --> 19:47.460]  So in most cigarettes,
[19:47.460 --> 19:50.180]  it's not all one type of tobacco in there.
[19:50.180 --> 19:52.140]  That's several different types of tobacco
[19:52.140 --> 19:53.540]  and they blend it together.
[19:53.540 --> 19:56.700]  And they do the same thing with whiskeys too.
[19:58.820 --> 20:00.980]  A lot of those are blends from different barrels.
[20:00.980 --> 20:03.340]  And if it's all from one barrel,
[20:03.940 --> 20:06.660]  usually because that barrel was special
[20:06.660 --> 20:10.140]  and those bottles are gonna be very expensive.
[20:10.140 --> 20:14.780]  So there's the chickens, tobacco, vegetables.
[20:14.780 --> 20:16.260]  I could talk about vegetables all day.
[20:16.260 --> 20:18.580]  I grow a lot of stuff.
[20:18.580 --> 20:19.420]  So-
[20:19.420 --> 20:20.500]  We got time.
[20:20.500 --> 20:24.340]  Okay, well, the stuff that I sent you,
[20:24.340 --> 20:27.300]  that basil, I spent years working on that
[20:27.300 --> 20:29.700]  because I like the flavor of basil
[20:29.700 --> 20:31.580]  and sauces and other things.
[20:31.580 --> 20:34.020]  But I always hated that it would like
[20:34.020 --> 20:35.740]  sometimes taste like licorice.
[20:36.620 --> 20:40.060]  So I found out that some basils that you can,
[20:40.060 --> 20:42.220]  you get basil seed that didn't taste like licorice.
[20:42.220 --> 20:45.100]  So I got some of that, but it tastes like fucking medicine.
[20:45.100 --> 20:47.420]  So I was left with either, okay,
[20:47.420 --> 20:50.100]  I've got this stuff that tastes like,
[20:51.860 --> 20:53.180]  yeah, yeah.
[20:53.180 --> 20:56.140]  So that's the, there's a lot of seeds in there too, man.
[20:56.140 --> 20:58.300]  You can, that's a lifetime supplier.
[20:58.300 --> 20:59.820]  You can pass those up.
[20:59.820 --> 21:00.940]  Anyway, yeah.
[21:00.940 --> 21:04.900]  And that's really all I selected for with that.
[21:04.900 --> 21:06.260]  It is five generations in
[21:06.260 --> 21:08.100]  and I really don't feel like going any further with it.
[21:08.100 --> 21:11.100]  I've got plenty of seeds, last me forever.
[21:11.100 --> 21:15.940]  And I'm happy with the flavor and smell and everything.
[21:15.940 --> 21:16.780]  There's none of that.
[21:16.780 --> 21:18.900]  You're not gonna find any licorice in there.
[21:18.900 --> 21:20.540]  That's, yeah.
[21:20.540 --> 21:22.060]  That stuff will ruin your spaghetti.
[21:22.060 --> 21:23.860]  As you think about, anyway,
[21:23.860 --> 21:25.220]  I don't know why people use it.
[21:25.220 --> 21:29.460]  So there's, and right now I'm working on a rosemary.
[21:29.460 --> 21:33.180]  I've gotten tired of searching and searching for ARP.
[21:33.180 --> 21:35.580]  I don't know if anybody's heard of ARP rosemary,
[21:35.580 --> 21:38.740]  but I've gotten a lot of fake ARP rosemary cuttings.
[21:38.740 --> 21:40.700]  And it's supposed to be this hardy rosemary
[21:40.700 --> 21:42.940]  that'll overwinter and you don't have to keep planting
[21:42.940 --> 21:44.840]  this stuff and all of that.
[21:44.840 --> 21:48.340]  So I got tired of getting burned on that.
[21:48.340 --> 21:51.140]  So I decided to just buy a bunch of seeds,
[21:51.140 --> 21:55.820]  like any different source of rosemary seed that I could find.
[21:55.820 --> 21:58.060]  I bought it up and I've got a bunch of them planted.
[21:58.060 --> 22:01.820]  And that's what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna plant
[22:01.820 --> 22:04.860]  probably a quarter acre with a bunch of rosemary.
[22:07.340 --> 22:11.980]  I think this was for the basil, but yeah, man.
[22:11.980 --> 22:13.740]  This is good stuff.
[22:13.740 --> 22:15.220]  One of the things I wanted to do
[22:15.220 --> 22:16.700]  that I thought would be cool.
[22:16.700 --> 22:19.340]  And this would be with your blessing and other people's,
[22:19.340 --> 22:23.940]  but like when people order cannabis seeds,
[22:23.940 --> 22:27.500]  I wanted to just like stick in other vegetables.
[22:28.420 --> 22:30.140]  Some basil, some daikon.
[22:30.140 --> 22:32.580]  I mean, like I have here, someone was mentioning,
[22:32.580 --> 22:35.740]  someone asked if you had grown Hopi tobacco
[22:35.740 --> 22:38.340]  and I grew Aztec tobacco.
[22:38.340 --> 22:40.180]  Let me just grab, hold on.
[22:40.180 --> 22:41.460]  Yeah.
[22:41.460 --> 22:43.300]  Yeah, so I've grown the Aztec tobacco
[22:43.300 --> 22:45.620]  and that stuff will make you trip.
[22:45.620 --> 22:47.820]  There's something in there, it's weird.
[22:47.820 --> 22:49.100]  And it's not a fun trip.
[22:49.100 --> 22:52.660]  It wasn't like it was enjoyable, but yeah.
[22:52.660 --> 22:56.220]  I tried to roll a little blunt with it.
[22:56.220 --> 22:57.500]  That didn't work out very well,
[22:57.500 --> 22:59.020]  but I could tell the difference.
[22:59.020 --> 23:01.940]  There was something weird in that stuff,
[23:01.940 --> 23:03.420]  but I don't know about Hopi,
[23:04.820 --> 23:09.100]  but the Aztec was interesting.
[23:09.100 --> 23:10.580]  Yeah.
[23:10.580 --> 23:15.140]  So this is all a shaman tobacco from,
[23:15.140 --> 23:17.360]  so super high nicotine,
[23:18.820 --> 23:22.180]  just from like 10 plants that I grew this past summer.
[23:22.180 --> 23:25.540]  So I'm just like, what am I supposed to do with this?
[23:25.860 --> 23:26.860]  Don't kill yourself with it.
[23:26.860 --> 23:29.100]  Yeah, no, I'd love to just send,
[23:29.100 --> 23:31.780]  you know, like I like the idea of sending everything
[23:31.780 --> 23:34.140]  in like pods if possible.
[23:34.140 --> 23:37.740]  So I have, like I'm taking down cabbage.
[23:37.740 --> 23:39.980]  I mean, not cabbage, cauliflower.
[23:42.460 --> 23:44.580]  Yeah, I've never had a success with cauliflower
[23:44.580 --> 23:46.740]  or broccoli or any of that stuff.
[23:46.740 --> 23:49.620]  Just, and even got it to go to seed.
[23:49.620 --> 23:51.980]  It looks like radish seeds.
[23:51.980 --> 23:52.820]  What's that?
[23:52.820 --> 23:54.500]  Those look like radish seeds.
[23:54.500 --> 23:56.960]  Like the same sort of like little pod.
[23:58.100 --> 23:59.500]  I wonder if they're in the same family.
[23:59.500 --> 24:01.060]  No, what you're holding there?
[24:01.060 --> 24:03.140]  You've got that cauliflower.
[24:03.140 --> 24:04.700]  Yeah, those must be in the same family
[24:04.700 --> 24:06.140]  because those seed pods look,
[24:07.540 --> 24:10.860]  well, you said that your radish went to seed, right?
[24:10.860 --> 24:12.100]  Yeah, so hold on.
[24:12.100 --> 24:14.060]  So the daikon, hold on.
[24:16.420 --> 24:20.100]  Yeah, every radish that I've found looks like that.
[24:20.100 --> 24:22.420]  Like the, when it gets seeded out,
[24:22.420 --> 24:24.620]  it looks like those little pods right there.
[24:28.140 --> 24:31.180]  So this is one daikon plant.
[24:34.280 --> 24:35.120]  Can you see that?
[24:35.120 --> 24:38.840]  Wow, yeah, those are, that's a different type of pod
[24:38.840 --> 24:41.120]  than the daikons that I had seed out on me.
[24:41.120 --> 24:42.840]  They looked more like that cauliflower.
[24:42.840 --> 24:44.080]  That's cool.
[24:44.080 --> 24:46.800]  And then, hold on.
[24:48.040 --> 24:50.920]  Okay, so here's Gemma.
[24:50.920 --> 24:51.760]  You ready?
[24:51.760 --> 24:55.120]  Yeah.
[24:55.120 --> 24:56.160]  Can you pull it out?
[24:57.000 --> 25:00.120]  I was gonna have Gemma try to pull the daikon out, but-
[25:00.120 --> 25:02.720]  No, no, no, no, don't, don't, no, no, no, don't dig.
[25:02.720 --> 25:04.640]  Ah, baby, okay, you want me to help?
[25:04.640 --> 25:06.080]  Yeah.
[25:06.080 --> 25:07.960]  Okay, ready?
[25:10.440 --> 25:12.240]  So this was the end of life.
[25:15.960 --> 25:17.320]  Okay, careful.
[25:18.400 --> 25:20.120]  And this thing just took over.
[25:20.120 --> 25:23.240]  I mean, it like, this is-
[25:23.240 --> 25:24.400]  So much dirt hanging.
[25:24.400 --> 25:25.240]  I know.
[25:26.400 --> 25:27.240]  Ah.
[25:30.800 --> 25:33.960]  Okay, come over in the grass.
[25:33.960 --> 25:35.320]  Come here.
[25:35.320 --> 25:36.480]  Okay, hold it.
[25:37.720 --> 25:39.720]  What are you gonna do?
[25:39.720 --> 25:43.400]  Gemma just taking a bath and wanted to look fabulous
[25:43.400 --> 25:44.920]  after her bath.
[25:44.920 --> 25:46.600]  I think I just ate some dirt.
[25:46.600 --> 25:47.680]  You did eat some dirt.
[25:47.680 --> 25:48.520]  I did.
[25:48.520 --> 25:50.480]  All right, hold it like that.
[25:50.480 --> 25:51.520]  Hold it like that.
[25:52.480 --> 25:53.320]  You got it?
[25:58.070 --> 25:59.510]  Okay, hold on.
[25:59.510 --> 26:03.430]  So anyway, that was, all these seeds are from that one plant.
[26:03.430 --> 26:04.910]  Do you know what that is?
[26:04.910 --> 26:05.750]  No.
[26:05.750 --> 26:07.110]  It's a- Oh, a snail on it.
[26:07.110 --> 26:08.590]  It's a daikon radish.
[26:08.590 --> 26:09.870]  Okay, I'll grab the snail later.
[26:09.870 --> 26:10.710]  Just leave the snail.
[26:10.710 --> 26:12.110]  Don't worry about the snail.
[26:14.390 --> 26:17.430]  Was anything else able to grow in that bed?
[26:17.430 --> 26:20.310]  Yeah, no, that, I mean, I had, in that same bed,
[26:20.310 --> 26:23.750]  there's a ton of chard
[26:23.750 --> 26:28.710]  and some of the cauliflower.
[26:28.710 --> 26:33.710]  And then I had a white wheat growing on the other side.
[26:35.390 --> 26:38.550]  And so now that I pulled that daikon out,
[26:38.550 --> 26:42.830]  I'm gonna put a whole new wave of stuff in there.
[26:44.670 --> 26:48.310]  Anyway, that was, but I thought it'd be cool,
[26:48.310 --> 26:51.310]  again, if people order stuff, it's just like,
[26:51.470 --> 26:56.150]  you know, like, you get this and you get like one of the,
[26:56.150 --> 26:58.710]  just like whatever I have lying around.
[27:00.150 --> 27:00.990]  I don't know.
[27:00.990 --> 27:03.710]  You should probably like have a question.
[27:03.710 --> 27:05.390]  Yeah, you should probably have a question
[27:05.390 --> 27:07.710]  on this when they're checking out.
[27:07.710 --> 27:08.790]  Do you grow veggies?
[27:08.790 --> 27:11.390]  Are you a Brussels sprout fan?
[27:11.390 --> 27:12.230]  Enthusiast?
[27:13.230 --> 27:14.670]  All right, congratulations
[27:14.670 --> 27:16.110]  on getting that cauliflower to work.
[27:16.110 --> 27:18.630]  I've never been able to get cauliflower or broccoli
[27:18.670 --> 27:21.430]  to like head out and like where you could eat anything
[27:21.430 --> 27:22.270]  off of it.
[27:23.030 --> 27:24.590]  So yeah, congrats on that.
[27:24.590 --> 27:28.950]  Some of them I ate and then a bunch I let go to flower.
[27:28.950 --> 27:33.950]  And so now I'm replanting those and so.
[27:35.270 --> 27:36.430]  Which one of those tomatoes
[27:36.430 --> 27:38.470]  are you gonna try out this year?
[27:38.470 --> 27:39.590]  I'm gonna do all of them.
[27:39.590 --> 27:40.430]  Oh, wow.
[27:41.350 --> 27:42.190]  Man.
[27:43.110 --> 27:45.390]  You, I mean, you had different purposes,
[27:45.390 --> 27:48.910]  like one for making, good for making sauces, right?
[27:48.910 --> 27:52.030]  So here are your tomato seeds.
[27:52.030 --> 27:57.100]  Yeah.
[27:57.100 --> 27:57.940]  Sort of.
[27:57.940 --> 27:59.340]  I try to provide a good description
[27:59.340 --> 28:02.700]  is because you know, it shows that I've looked at it.
[28:02.700 --> 28:03.900]  Like I know what it is.
[28:03.900 --> 28:07.660]  So we have the Luther Burbank, which let's see is,
[28:07.660 --> 28:12.660]  as you said, the Luther Burbank is,
[28:15.420 --> 28:17.660]  that's one of the full-size heirloom tomatoes.
[28:17.660 --> 28:19.620]  So you had the boxcar Willie,
[28:19.620 --> 28:24.620]  the Luther Burbank slicing, the CU, the black crim,
[28:24.940 --> 28:26.860]  for the snacking salad tomatoes,
[28:26.860 --> 28:31.860]  you had my grape F7, chocolate cherry, yellow pear,
[28:32.100 --> 28:35.940]  and then the sauce tomatoes, you had a Roma and a Juliet.
[28:35.940 --> 28:36.780]  Yeah.
[28:36.780 --> 28:38.460]  Oh yeah, so yeah.
[28:38.460 --> 28:41.620]  Now maybe I won't start this because that's, yeah.
[28:41.620 --> 28:42.980]  That's a lot.
[28:42.980 --> 28:45.060]  One in each bucket, how about that?
[28:45.060 --> 28:45.900]  Yeah.
[28:45.900 --> 28:46.940]  Yeah.
[28:46.940 --> 28:50.460]  Those yellow pears, that's a very old heirloom.
[28:50.460 --> 28:54.140]  Like it was heirloom before, but that is from this old man,
[28:54.140 --> 28:55.660]  this old farmer that I know.
[28:55.660 --> 28:58.620]  And those just plant themselves each year.
[28:58.620 --> 29:00.220]  He doesn't even plant those anymore.
[29:00.220 --> 29:01.060]  They just come up.
[29:01.060 --> 29:03.480]  So yeah, and they're really good.
[29:04.980 --> 29:09.060]  So I've bred all kinds of vegetables.
[29:09.060 --> 29:11.520]  I've got a cantaloupe that I selected out.
[29:11.520 --> 29:12.360]  That's that thing.
[29:12.480 --> 29:16.440]  It's a palm of your hand and just sweet as can be.
[29:18.880 --> 29:20.120]  Yeah, it's amazing stuff.
[29:21.760 --> 29:23.100]  But I mean, I think it, you know,
[29:23.100 --> 29:25.200]  this gets to kind of where I was trying
[29:25.200 --> 29:29.000]  to tease the conversation is just like big ag
[29:29.000 --> 29:32.080]  versus just all over the country.
[29:32.080 --> 29:35.840]  There are people like you kind of doing their thing
[29:35.840 --> 29:40.160]  and pushing stuff in a super flavorful direction
[29:40.160 --> 29:41.680]  that they like, you know?
[29:41.680 --> 29:43.200]  And everyone has preferences.
[29:43.200 --> 29:46.640]  You love haze, other people may hate it, but to each his own.
[29:46.640 --> 29:49.120]  Yeah, absolutely.
[29:49.120 --> 29:51.960]  But, and I think that every-
[29:51.960 --> 29:54.640]  I do like my Italian cooking, so I'm excited.
[29:54.640 --> 29:55.840]  Good deal.
[29:55.840 --> 29:58.600]  I wish that everybody that has the desire to,
[29:58.600 --> 30:01.080]  I wish they would select in their own direction
[30:01.080 --> 30:03.840]  because a lot of the seed market I've noticed,
[30:03.840 --> 30:08.720]  it's like everybody's going for the same things.
[30:08.720 --> 30:10.500]  It's like, and how do you know?
[30:11.920 --> 30:13.600]  Yeah, he says that a lot.
[30:17.120 --> 30:19.160]  What somebody else selects for
[30:19.160 --> 30:22.320]  isn't gonna float your boat, you know?
[30:23.400 --> 30:26.840]  Yeah, yeah, I like smoking those.
[30:26.840 --> 30:30.080]  Like putting those on the fire with some oak smoke.
[30:30.080 --> 30:32.120]  Yeah, those are, they make really good sauce.
[30:32.120 --> 30:34.840]  Okay, I need to quit reading that shit, man.
[30:34.840 --> 30:36.360]  I think in the summer, I mean,
[30:36.360 --> 30:37.680]  cause a tobacco plant,
[30:37.680 --> 30:40.320]  you're not waiting for it to flower and finish.
[30:41.320 --> 30:46.320]  I mean, so during its whole growth cycle, what's that?
[30:46.480 --> 30:48.520]  Tobacco takes a little while to get going.
[30:48.520 --> 30:52.160]  You grew it and it starts off like really small and slow.
[30:52.160 --> 30:54.720]  And then like it takes about two or three months
[30:54.720 --> 30:57.840]  for it to like puff up and then you've got something.
[30:57.840 --> 30:59.260]  But it takes it a while to get there.
[30:59.260 --> 31:01.360]  So I don't know nothing about Alaska.
[31:01.360 --> 31:04.640]  It seems like there's some cool people up there, but yeah.
[31:04.640 --> 31:07.800]  Imagine growing anything up there would be a chore.
[31:07.800 --> 31:09.680]  That AK Bean Brains dude,
[31:09.680 --> 31:13.080]  he's doing some work up there apparently.
[31:13.080 --> 31:13.920]  Yeah.
[31:14.920 --> 31:15.760]  Yeah.
[31:20.240 --> 31:21.680]  All right, so your tomatoes,
[31:21.680 --> 31:25.560]  your talk about kind of what you've been growing
[31:25.560 --> 31:27.160]  and breeding and where you've been.
[31:27.160 --> 31:32.160]  Where like, you mentioned one that you got from an old guy.
[31:32.160 --> 31:33.880]  Yeah, that yellow pear came from him.
[31:33.880 --> 31:37.400]  And that's just, that's a volunteer.
[31:38.040 --> 31:39.160]  Nobody's really done anything to that
[31:39.160 --> 31:41.040]  since he planted those a long time ago.
[31:41.040 --> 31:43.280]  And they just keep coming up in the same spot.
[31:43.280 --> 31:46.080]  That grape tomato that started off
[31:46.080 --> 31:48.880]  as just something good we got from the grocery store
[31:48.880 --> 31:50.320]  and we saved seeds from it.
[31:50.320 --> 31:53.920]  And when I planted those seeds the next season,
[31:53.920 --> 31:56.760]  you could tell that the originals were F1
[31:56.760 --> 31:59.120]  because it was just all over the place.
[31:59.120 --> 32:02.160]  They were all like different sizes of small tomato.
[32:02.160 --> 32:04.600]  There wasn't like everything from a little bitty tiny
[32:04.600 --> 32:07.040]  like pea sized tomato all the way up to a big
[32:07.680 --> 32:10.840]  like fat heirloom, but it was like all small tomatoes
[32:10.840 --> 32:13.240]  but it was like little pea sized ones that were like
[32:13.240 --> 32:16.000]  that sweet and almost tasted like strawberries
[32:16.000 --> 32:18.320]  all the way to these big fat honkers.
[32:18.320 --> 32:20.360]  It was probably like an inch and a half
[32:21.280 --> 32:24.820]  big fat grape tomatoes, but you never get to eat them
[32:24.820 --> 32:27.420]  because they would split and rot before they would
[32:28.440 --> 32:29.280]  ripen up.
[32:29.280 --> 32:31.320]  So I found something kind of in the middle
[32:31.320 --> 32:33.120]  that held up well.
[32:33.120 --> 32:37.080]  And you just, over time, I started with flavor
[32:37.080 --> 32:38.920]  like, cause you're gonna eat this shit.
[32:38.920 --> 32:41.240]  So you wanna start with flavor with something like that.
[32:41.240 --> 32:44.320]  And then over time you see the problems that it has
[32:44.320 --> 32:47.960]  and you try to select away from those problems every season.
[32:47.960 --> 32:49.720]  Like with tomatoes, there's all kinds of shit
[32:49.720 --> 32:50.720]  that can happen with those.
[32:50.720 --> 32:52.280]  There's like blossom end rot.
[32:52.280 --> 32:55.320]  And then there's just fruit rot.
[32:55.320 --> 32:58.840]  Like they will rot on the vine before they finish for you.
[32:58.840 --> 33:00.260]  And that's undesirable.
[33:00.260 --> 33:02.120]  So you select away from that.
[33:02.120 --> 33:05.640]  And so that grape tomato is just,
[33:05.640 --> 33:07.840]  it's always been really consistent
[33:07.840 --> 33:11.120]  and it's acclimated to my environment now.
[33:11.120 --> 33:13.000]  So it's the first thing to fruit,
[33:13.000 --> 33:14.640]  not necessarily the first thing to ripen,
[33:14.640 --> 33:16.600]  but it's the first thing to start fruiting.
[33:16.600 --> 33:20.120]  And we have something ready for when it's salad time
[33:20.120 --> 33:20.940]  and all of that.
[33:20.940 --> 33:27.720]  And then other problems with tomatoes is cracking.
[33:28.660 --> 33:30.620]  Cracking is a huge.
[33:31.220 --> 33:32.900]  I was gonna have a question about it.
[33:32.900 --> 33:33.780]  Tell me about that.
[33:33.780 --> 33:36.520]  Cause that's, you're basically talking about like the skin
[33:36.520 --> 33:39.260]  basically like breaks in a part, right?
[33:39.260 --> 33:40.100]  Yes.
[33:40.100 --> 33:41.300]  That happens to my,
[33:41.300 --> 33:43.700]  I was wondering if that's like a nutrient issue
[33:43.700 --> 33:47.760]  or what that's a symptom of, or that's just.
[33:47.760 --> 33:49.780]  Well, there's several factors involved.
[33:49.780 --> 33:53.580]  There's genetic predisposition to do it.
[33:53.580 --> 33:56.880]  And they say that water fluctuation is a big issue.
[33:56.880 --> 34:00.260]  Like that's why they started doing hydroponics mainly
[34:00.900 --> 34:04.260]  in commercial tomato farms is because they have control
[34:04.260 --> 34:07.100]  over those water levels and it stays consistent
[34:07.100 --> 34:09.740]  to where there's the plant doesn't dry out
[34:09.740 --> 34:11.580]  and then fill up with water.
[34:11.580 --> 34:13.180]  Yeah. Overwatering.
[34:13.180 --> 34:15.460]  And that's what they came up with.
[34:15.460 --> 34:18.340]  Hydroponic tomatoes work the best for their purpose
[34:18.340 --> 34:20.980]  because they don't crack on them like that.
[34:20.980 --> 34:22.380]  But first you've got to find some
[34:22.380 --> 34:24.800]  that aren't gonna just do it just to do it.
[34:24.800 --> 34:28.100]  Cause it has to do with skin thickness too.
[34:28.100 --> 34:30.420]  It can't be too thick or it'll crack
[34:30.420 --> 34:33.100]  and it can't be too thin or it'll crack.
[34:33.100 --> 34:34.980]  That's another thing that I've noticed.
[34:34.980 --> 34:38.540]  And who wants to chew on a big thick tomato skin?
[34:38.540 --> 34:40.500]  Yeah. So that's,
[34:40.500 --> 34:42.980]  it seems like the commercial lag is correct on this one
[34:42.980 --> 34:45.940]  that water fluctuation is the main cause.
[34:47.700 --> 34:48.660]  It's interesting.
[34:48.660 --> 34:51.100]  Cause I don't feel like I, I mean, my beds,
[34:51.100 --> 34:56.100]  I I'm a light water, like I'd rather keep everything
[34:56.500 --> 35:01.500]  consistently like almost like yearning for water versus.
[35:03.180 --> 35:04.180]  Yeah.
[35:04.180 --> 35:06.060]  There's very few plants that I've found
[35:06.060 --> 35:08.620]  that really want to be soaked all the time.
[35:08.620 --> 35:11.100]  Like I think that everything likes to dry out
[35:11.100 --> 35:14.100]  and get a little air before they get watered again.
[35:14.100 --> 35:15.820]  But then there's like this tomato issue
[35:15.820 --> 35:16.740]  that we're talking about.
[35:16.740 --> 35:17.980]  Like the plant may love it,
[35:17.980 --> 35:20.700]  but we don't like the results of the fruits
[35:20.700 --> 35:21.880]  because they don't care
[35:21.880 --> 35:23.740]  because it's still gonna fall and brought
[35:23.740 --> 35:26.340]  and the seeds are gonna come back next year anyway,
[35:26.340 --> 35:27.780]  at least in the plant's mind.
[35:29.180 --> 35:32.620]  So I don't know, it's 420, man.
[35:32.620 --> 35:34.460]  Let's do a little smoking.
[35:36.460 --> 35:37.300]  Well, what is it?
[35:37.300 --> 35:38.360]  I just had lunch.
[35:42.220 --> 35:44.980]  So what are you, what are you smoking right now?
[35:44.980 --> 35:49.980]  I've got a little black late black lights times the 88.
[35:50.940 --> 35:54.900]  It's a 88 G13 hash plant that Duke made.
[35:54.900 --> 35:59.900]  I took what I got from that and open pollinated it
[36:01.980 --> 36:05.740]  and selected a male out of those open pollinated seeds
[36:06.820 --> 36:11.820]  so that I could, I'm replenishing everything right now.
[36:12.620 --> 36:15.180]  So I started with the Indica's
[36:16.060 --> 36:17.660]  because that's what my wife likes.
[36:18.180 --> 36:20.620]  I decided that I was gonna get something
[36:20.620 --> 36:21.780]  going for her first.
[36:21.780 --> 36:24.020]  So I'm going through these Afghan plants.
[36:24.020 --> 36:25.820]  That's a thoughtful husband.
[36:25.820 --> 36:28.320]  Yeah, you know, we do everything together.
[36:28.320 --> 36:30.820]  We don't make decisions apart from each other and stuff,
[36:30.820 --> 36:32.860]  especially with this kind of thing.
[36:34.060 --> 36:37.420]  So yeah, I would have started with the hazes
[36:37.420 --> 36:40.180]  and haze was next in line until Seeds Here Now
[36:40.180 --> 36:43.500]  posted some of those lifesavers from bog.
[36:43.500 --> 36:46.300]  So I got that lifesaver jumped line
[36:46.300 --> 36:48.940]  because I've been in a little pain lately.
[36:48.940 --> 36:50.420]  It's a working hard.
[36:50.420 --> 36:55.420]  So, and that stuff, I saw that stuff save a man's life.
[36:55.620 --> 36:57.980]  Like literally save a man.
[36:57.980 --> 37:00.980]  Like he was the most cantankerous asshole
[37:00.980 --> 37:02.340]  that you had ever met.
[37:02.340 --> 37:05.260]  And it was just because he couldn't sleep
[37:05.260 --> 37:08.660]  and he had pain from war injuries and stuff.
[37:08.660 --> 37:12.740]  But he got ahold of that stuff and man, new dude.
[37:12.740 --> 37:15.860]  Yeah, constant acute pain.
[37:16.540 --> 37:21.540]  I had when coronavirus first started
[37:22.380 --> 37:25.060]  and I don't know if it was because I was stressed over that
[37:25.060 --> 37:27.400]  or what was going on, but I got,
[37:29.580 --> 37:31.580]  what's the jaw?
[37:33.300 --> 37:34.540]  It'll come to me in a minute,
[37:34.540 --> 37:37.780]  but like you have an acute pain in your jaw,
[37:37.780 --> 37:41.340]  like the back of your jaw that just will not go away
[37:41.340 --> 37:43.220]  and it doesn't leave you.
[37:43.220 --> 37:45.940]  And so just all day, all night.
[37:47.780 --> 37:48.900]  And I was freaking out.
[37:48.900 --> 37:50.700]  My sister's an orthopedic surgeon.
[37:50.700 --> 37:55.700]  And I was like, I feel like I might have coronavirus.
[37:56.300 --> 37:57.900]  And then I was stressing out even more.
[37:57.900 --> 37:59.420]  Yeah, TMJ, there we go.
[37:59.420 --> 38:00.660]  That's what I was looking for.
[38:00.660 --> 38:02.340]  You got too much jaw?
[38:02.340 --> 38:07.340]  And I mean, I was, yeah, it was a pain like I've never,
[38:07.340 --> 38:10.340]  pain, but like that does not go away.
[38:10.340 --> 38:13.100]  And so I mean, just think of how many people
[38:13.100 --> 38:15.540]  are in that type of pain, just like,
[38:15.540 --> 38:17.900]  and what it does to you psychologically.
[38:19.380 --> 38:20.220]  Yeah, yeah.
[38:20.220 --> 38:22.620]  And when you're in that kind of pain,
[38:22.620 --> 38:24.940]  is it really gonna blame somebody for being an asshole,
[38:24.940 --> 38:27.460]  especially for like almost dying for you
[38:27.460 --> 38:28.860]  over in some desert somewhere.
[38:28.860 --> 38:31.980]  So you kind of have patience with people like that.
[38:31.980 --> 38:34.580]  Yeah, I mean, I think it's just,
[38:34.580 --> 38:36.980]  you kind of have patience with people like that.
[38:38.420 --> 38:40.140]  That was the, I just said,
[38:40.140 --> 38:42.700]  it was the black lights and then the 88.
[38:42.700 --> 38:43.980]  And I just learned something.
[38:43.980 --> 38:48.420]  That black lights is half black domino and other half NL1.
[38:48.420 --> 38:52.580]  And I was going back and looking at some of my files
[38:52.580 --> 38:54.340]  just so I didn't say anything on here
[38:54.340 --> 38:56.060]  that was like off base.
[38:56.060 --> 38:58.140]  You know, I had to make sure that I had my facts straight.
[38:58.140 --> 39:03.140]  And I have been wrong about something for a very long time
[39:04.100 --> 39:05.620]  on that black lights.
[39:05.620 --> 39:07.620]  And it's because it's so confusing.
[39:07.620 --> 39:12.220]  Like the, I went and found where Neville
[39:12.220 --> 39:13.180]  was talking about it.
[39:13.180 --> 39:17.380]  And he was saying that it was a four-way Indica hybrid
[39:18.500 --> 39:22.200]  and that he made it different ways.
[39:22.200 --> 39:25.860]  It's, let me just, it'll be really fast.
[39:25.860 --> 39:26.700]  Hold on.
[39:27.860 --> 39:29.420]  You still see and hear me?
[39:29.420 --> 39:30.260]  Yep.
[39:30.260 --> 39:31.220]  Okay.
[39:31.220 --> 39:32.820]  Let me find this really fast.
[39:34.140 --> 39:38.380]  But it's a four-way Indica hybrid.
[39:38.380 --> 39:40.940]  And I thought that it had this special plant
[39:40.940 --> 39:45.440]  that he had in it called a maple leaf Afghan tea.
[39:45.440 --> 39:47.420]  And I've been thinking that for years
[39:47.420 --> 39:49.820]  and black domino does not have that in there
[39:49.820 --> 39:51.100]  according to him.
[39:51.100 --> 39:59.230]  And let me find, but he made it several different ways.
[40:00.310 --> 40:03.790]  So anybody that's got black domino cuts out there
[40:03.790 --> 40:06.310]  and somebody saying, well, that's not like mine.
[40:06.310 --> 40:07.710]  There's a reason for that.
[40:07.710 --> 40:10.510]  Not only just a phenotypical reason, obviously,
[40:10.510 --> 40:13.950]  but there's a, he made it differently several times.
[40:13.950 --> 40:17.190]  And let me find, okay, here's where he first
[40:17.190 --> 40:19.030]  like interjects about it.
[40:19.030 --> 40:21.270]  Black domino was a four-way Indica hybrid
[40:21.270 --> 40:22.510]  I made for Sensi.
[40:22.510 --> 40:24.310]  I was going for big seeds, bracts
[40:24.310 --> 40:27.990]  with large resin globules and stocked glands.
[40:29.070 --> 40:30.470]  Some people wanted yields.
[40:30.470 --> 40:33.950]  So I substituted garlic bud for one of the Indicas.
[40:35.230 --> 40:37.950]  Don't know what's been happening at Sensi since then.
[40:37.950 --> 40:39.790]  Okay, and then he talks about it a little more
[40:39.790 --> 40:41.310]  cause he's not very clear there.
[40:41.310 --> 40:43.070]  And he never really is.
[40:43.070 --> 40:46.030]  Other than it's not Afghan number one.
[40:46.030 --> 40:47.630]  He says that right here.
[40:47.630 --> 40:50.550]  This one of the Indicas is not Afghan number one.
[40:50.550 --> 40:53.790]  It's another Afghan that he got from Sam.
[40:55.190 --> 40:57.430]  And he just calls it Sam's Afghan.
[40:57.430 --> 41:01.430]  And the first time that he made a black domino,
[41:01.430 --> 41:03.870]  it was Ortega.
[41:06.190 --> 41:12.530]  No, see, he says all kinds of stuff right here.
[41:12.690 --> 41:19.690]  And it gets, anyway, I'm sorry that this is bad for.
[41:21.170 --> 41:24.570]  It's okay, we're all, everyone's relaxed.
[41:24.570 --> 41:25.690]  Okay, good, good, good.
[41:25.690 --> 41:27.370]  No rush.
[41:27.370 --> 41:30.210]  But where the confusion came in with me
[41:30.210 --> 41:34.130]  is that he talks about that Afghan tea
[41:34.130 --> 41:37.530]  while he's given the lineage of the black domino.
[41:38.570 --> 41:41.370]  And that's what makes it complicated.
[41:41.370 --> 41:44.730]  And I just conflated that in my memory
[41:44.730 --> 41:46.290]  because it's in the same post.
[41:46.290 --> 41:48.470]  And for some reason it's deeper in here
[41:48.470 --> 41:50.330]  than I thought it was.
[41:50.330 --> 41:51.690]  There's a lot of other people talking
[41:51.690 --> 41:55.210]  before he interjects again and clarifies.
[41:55.210 --> 41:58.050]  But he made it once using the mails
[41:58.050 --> 42:01.730]  from Sam's other Afghan that was not Afghan one.
[42:01.730 --> 42:03.370]  He talks about how he hated that shit
[42:03.370 --> 42:06.250]  and culled it from his library and all this other stuff.
[42:06.250 --> 42:08.090]  And he said that people bitched about the yields here.
[42:08.090 --> 42:08.970]  Yes, I found it.
[42:08.970 --> 42:10.050]  People bitched about the yields
[42:10.050 --> 42:12.890]  and he substituted with garlic bud.
[42:12.890 --> 42:17.890]  All right, the maple leaf is what people think
[42:18.530 --> 42:22.210]  is in the black domino, but it's not.
[42:22.210 --> 42:25.090]  He had two maple leaf indicas that he selected out.
[42:25.090 --> 42:27.410]  One was T and one was S.
[42:29.050 --> 42:33.250]  And the maple leaf line provided me
[42:33.250 --> 42:35.490]  with a plant that I labeled Afghan T.
[42:35.490 --> 42:38.850]  This plant is the mother of super slash ultra skunk
[42:38.850 --> 42:41.650]  and also crossed well with haze C.
[42:41.650 --> 42:46.370]  So that's where he mentions the Afghan T
[42:46.370 --> 42:49.250]  while he's talking about this other stuff
[42:49.250 --> 42:51.610]  going along with the black domino.
[42:53.010 --> 42:55.690]  And here's what he says about the black domino.
[42:55.690 --> 42:58.330]  The black domino was garlic bud,
[42:58.330 --> 43:03.330]  garlic bud times Cush four and garlic bud mails.
[43:04.050 --> 43:07.930]  These both mails, the garlic buds on the garlic bud end.
[43:10.210 --> 43:14.730]  Garlic bud time Cush four and garlic bud times NL2F4.
[43:18.530 --> 43:21.190]  And he decided to do, he says,
[43:22.210 --> 43:24.090]  I won't be able to find that deep in this thing,
[43:24.090 --> 43:25.790]  but he also says that he wasn't,
[43:27.050 --> 43:29.850]  that he switched to that garlic bud
[43:29.850 --> 43:34.410]  because people were bitching about Sam's strange Afghan.
[43:34.410 --> 43:36.170]  It wasn't yielding enough for them.
[43:38.570 --> 43:42.370]  He says, let me say one more thing about ML Afghan T.
[43:42.370 --> 43:44.730]  This plant had exactly the same smell
[43:44.730 --> 43:47.490]  as Sam's best skunk one, but more so.
[43:47.490 --> 43:50.730]  It has the true skunk archetype.
[43:50.730 --> 43:52.690]  I do not believe for one New York minute
[43:52.690 --> 43:55.730]  that Afghan number one is behind skunk number one,
[43:55.730 --> 43:58.390]  which lends credence to Mendocino Joe's story
[43:58.390 --> 44:00.490]  about skunk number one, whatever that means.
[44:00.490 --> 44:03.810]  I don't know what Mendocino Joe and all that is.
[44:03.810 --> 44:08.410]  But anyway, while he's talking about the black domino,
[44:08.410 --> 44:11.450]  he interjects that stuff about the Afghan T.
[44:11.450 --> 44:12.930]  So I thought that that was somewhere
[44:12.930 --> 44:16.070]  in that four-way cross, but no.
[44:16.070 --> 44:18.090]  So I've heard people,
[44:18.090 --> 44:19.290]  the reason that I'm bringing that up
[44:19.290 --> 44:21.850]  is because black domino creates some controversy.
[44:21.850 --> 44:23.850]  And I was adding more to it by saying
[44:23.850 --> 44:25.810]  there was something in there that's not.
[44:25.810 --> 44:29.170]  But the usual controversy with it is
[44:29.170 --> 44:31.250]  that some people don't believe
[44:31.250 --> 44:33.410]  that the other person's cut is real
[44:33.410 --> 44:35.390]  because he made it different.
[44:37.210 --> 44:40.890]  And supposedly, since he did that same thing afterward
[44:41.910 --> 44:45.410]  with other things, like he originally made that,
[44:45.410 --> 44:50.290]  like he said right there, the super skunk with Afghan T.
[44:50.290 --> 44:52.050]  And then supposedly later on,
[44:52.050 --> 44:55.770]  since he made the super skunk with Afghan S,
[44:55.770 --> 44:57.450]  which was her sister,
[44:57.450 --> 45:00.170]  and it had a more sweet background to it.
[45:00.170 --> 45:01.970]  And that's why people said that it changed
[45:01.970 --> 45:03.470]  after a certain point in time.
[45:03.470 --> 45:04.650]  But who knows, I wasn't there.
[45:04.650 --> 45:07.170]  It's just what he said and what people claim.
[45:08.050 --> 45:10.730]  I've never popped a seed of Sensi genetics.
[45:10.730 --> 45:12.330]  That's like when they were good,
[45:12.330 --> 45:15.430]  that was before I had access to that kind of thing.
[45:15.990 --> 45:17.470]  You know?
[45:17.470 --> 45:22.010]  So the first seeds that I ever ordered were from Gypsy
[45:22.010 --> 45:24.870]  and they were what they were supposed to be.
[45:24.870 --> 45:27.110]  So it kind of gave me some confidence,
[45:27.110 --> 45:29.910]  but also ordered some things from other people
[45:29.910 --> 45:31.790]  that were not what they were supposed to be.
[45:31.790 --> 45:33.290]  And they embarrassed me.
[45:33.290 --> 45:37.830]  I won't name name, but they embarrassed me
[45:37.830 --> 45:40.590]  with some people that I highly respected.
[45:40.590 --> 45:42.910]  And here I am, I'm coming with, it was good to me.
[45:42.910 --> 45:44.190]  And they said it was good smoke too,
[45:44.230 --> 45:47.110]  but it wasn't what I paid for.
[45:47.110 --> 45:47.950]  You know?
[45:47.950 --> 45:49.870]  So that kind of burned me.
[45:49.870 --> 45:51.710]  It's like, okay, that these older folks,
[45:51.710 --> 45:54.350]  you gotta be sure what you're talking about around them, man.
[45:54.350 --> 45:56.670]  It's like, I got this thing, it's called this.
[45:56.670 --> 45:58.830]  And they're like, nah, sorry, kid.
[45:58.830 --> 46:00.390]  It's good, but that's not that.
[46:01.370 --> 46:02.210]  So, okay.
[46:02.210 --> 46:04.610]  That's enough of a ramble about the Indicus.
[46:05.710 --> 46:06.550]  Hold on.
[46:06.550 --> 46:11.230]  So what, do you see that question?
[46:11.230 --> 46:12.350]  Hell, I don't know.
[46:12.350 --> 46:14.090]  He doesn't talk about years or any of that.
[46:14.930 --> 46:16.730]  This information you can check on your own.
[46:16.730 --> 46:18.410]  It's on the Mr. Nice forum.
[46:18.410 --> 46:20.050]  I'm sure it's still up there,
[46:20.050 --> 46:24.650]  but the Mr. Nice forums and look under Afghan Grail thread.
[46:24.650 --> 46:27.090]  And you can read the entire conversation
[46:27.090 --> 46:31.170]  even until it degrades into a shit throwing match.
[46:31.170 --> 46:34.610]  So, yeah, but I have no idea.
[46:34.610 --> 46:36.010]  Ask somebody that was there.
[46:36.930 --> 46:38.690]  That would be awesome to know.
[46:38.690 --> 46:40.890]  So actually, I mean, as I'm thinking kind of,
[46:40.890 --> 46:43.130]  you know, in the same way we're talking about,
[46:43.130 --> 46:48.130]  like tomatoes bred for the grocery store
[46:49.010 --> 46:52.010]  and chickens bred for their breast meat.
[46:52.010 --> 46:55.270]  Like the stuff you like that, yeah.
[46:55.270 --> 47:00.270]  The 44 double Ds, you know, it's on Mr. Toad's mind.
[47:03.450 --> 47:08.450]  But, you know, for the modern recreational commercial market
[47:10.050 --> 47:12.890]  I mean, things that take forever to flower
[47:13.650 --> 47:15.090]  or don't have monster yields,
[47:15.090 --> 47:17.410]  kind of they go the way of the dodo bird.
[47:17.410 --> 47:20.770]  And that's kind of what you're all about the dodo bird.
[47:20.770 --> 47:25.770]  So, I mean, the two things that I have going right now
[47:27.290 --> 47:32.150]  from you are, and these were on your recommendations,
[47:33.890 --> 47:34.770]  the Dreamtime.
[47:34.770 --> 47:36.890]  So can you talk about the Dreamtime Hayes,
[47:36.890 --> 47:38.450]  which that's your favorite, right?
[47:38.450 --> 47:39.290]  Is that?
[47:39.290 --> 47:42.010]  No, that's not my favorite, but it's the one that.
[47:42.010 --> 47:47.010]  So I was actually wrong on where the 44 Ds name came from.
[47:51.210 --> 47:54.170]  All right, Mr. Toad telling us to be gentlemen here.
[47:55.610 --> 48:00.610]  All right, the Dreamtime, I've recommended that one for you
[48:00.850 --> 48:04.330]  because it has that like up productive buzz.
[48:04.330 --> 48:07.010]  It flowers a little bit shorter in time
[48:07.010 --> 48:10.070]  and there's less of a chance of those going wonky on you
[48:10.070 --> 48:11.930]  with herms and all of that stuff on it.
[48:12.650 --> 48:14.770]  And that's all that is,
[48:14.770 --> 48:19.690]  is I got lucky on a pack of Dreamtime from Mr. Nice.
[48:19.690 --> 48:22.850]  And they were all like one of these,
[48:22.850 --> 48:27.090]  they were all really hazy to say the least.
[48:27.090 --> 48:28.650]  Some of them were unusable,
[48:30.330 --> 48:35.330]  but one of them that was unusable had like three
[48:36.170 --> 48:40.890]  or four inch spaces between the nodes
[48:40.890 --> 48:41.930]  and the one that was a baby.
[48:41.930 --> 48:43.650]  It was just like this boom.
[48:43.650 --> 48:45.970]  And then like, it was crazy.
[48:45.970 --> 48:48.170]  I could only imagine what that thing would look like
[48:48.170 --> 48:51.130]  if I let it grow out, it would have been a mess.
[48:51.130 --> 48:56.130]  So yeah, I used everything from that pack
[48:56.130 --> 48:57.970]  and all of it was very similar.
[48:57.970 --> 49:00.850]  It was like, it was like part of a project or something,
[49:01.930 --> 49:03.170]  like just the throwaways.
[49:03.170 --> 49:05.050]  Cause I know how it is when you're going down
[49:05.050 --> 49:06.290]  and there's just like steps,
[49:06.290 --> 49:08.650]  the things that are just steps along the way
[49:08.650 --> 49:11.530]  to what your actual purpose is.
[49:11.530 --> 49:13.410]  So, and that's what this stuff looked like to me.
[49:13.410 --> 49:14.770]  It was all very similar,
[49:14.770 --> 49:18.210]  but it was nice that I bought a supposed mix pack
[49:18.210 --> 49:21.690]  and it was, yeah, it was all haze.
[49:21.690 --> 49:24.890]  So I just like took everything that was usable,
[49:24.890 --> 49:26.490]  open pollinated that.
[49:26.490 --> 49:30.810]  And this is what I usually do is I like make wise choices,
[49:30.810 --> 49:34.050]  something that I can open pollinate, not F2.
[49:34.050 --> 49:35.170]  To me, there's a difference
[49:35.170 --> 49:37.450]  between open pollination and an F2.
[49:37.450 --> 49:39.390]  An F2 you're selecting a little bit.
[49:40.530 --> 49:41.970]  Yes.
[49:41.970 --> 49:42.850]  Yes.
[49:42.850 --> 49:43.910]  And a lot of other stuff.
[49:43.910 --> 49:46.010]  I had one that was like gunpowder,
[49:46.010 --> 49:49.170]  like had this really nasty, like smelled like gunpowder
[49:49.170 --> 49:51.290]  and had like a metallic taste.
[49:51.290 --> 49:54.810]  That's one of the things that I lost in September.
[49:54.810 --> 49:55.770]  Yeah.
[49:55.770 --> 49:56.810]  And it was a male.
[49:58.330 --> 50:00.570]  Yeah, it had a metallic taste to him.
[50:00.570 --> 50:03.890]  He was, yeah, I really wanted to use him.
[50:03.890 --> 50:05.370]  Anyway, okay.
[50:05.370 --> 50:10.330]  So with, and in those, that's what you're gonna get.
[50:10.330 --> 50:13.170]  What Toad was talking about there is that incense,
[50:13.170 --> 50:15.290]  not so much cat piss in those.
[50:15.290 --> 50:16.730]  I haven't found much cat piss.
[50:16.730 --> 50:19.090]  So what I do is I find something.
[50:19.090 --> 50:20.530]  I wasn't expecting it with that.
[50:20.530 --> 50:23.210]  But when I find something like that, that's similar,
[50:23.210 --> 50:25.490]  I open pollinate it so I can take a look
[50:25.490 --> 50:29.430]  at the broader family, like what all is in there.
[50:30.430 --> 50:35.430]  And when you do that, you get to see a little bit more
[50:36.310 --> 50:39.290]  than just that little 10 or 18 pack that you get.
[50:41.430 --> 50:42.270]  So.
[50:42.270 --> 50:44.710]  I'm just throwing up comments.
[50:44.710 --> 50:46.670]  He's absolutely right, man.
[50:46.670 --> 50:50.790]  Okay, so the, that Dreamtime,
[50:52.190 --> 50:53.670]  you get a lot of Frankie in there.
[50:53.670 --> 50:55.470]  There's a lot of that frankincense stuff.
[50:55.470 --> 50:57.150]  There's sandalwood.
[50:57.150 --> 51:00.150]  There's just like split greenwood.
[51:00.150 --> 51:01.430]  That's in a lot of the hazes,
[51:01.430 --> 51:03.070]  like a split greenwood flavor.
[51:04.950 --> 51:06.870]  Yeah, like he says, nothing really sweet.
[51:06.870 --> 51:08.590]  There's some skunky stuff in there too,
[51:08.590 --> 51:13.230]  because this is, you know, it's just one of Shanti's hybrids
[51:13.230 --> 51:17.270]  that he was doing somewhere along the line.
[51:17.270 --> 51:19.990]  It was, yeah.
[51:19.990 --> 51:22.750]  So that stuff, and it's pretty stable.
[51:22.750 --> 51:24.490]  You don't get a lot of Hermes and stuff.
[51:24.490 --> 51:27.070]  Whereas with, you asked me what my favorite was.
[51:27.910 --> 51:31.750]  My favorite is that Haze times skunk number one from Sam.
[51:31.750 --> 51:34.670]  And I ordered that from Cultivator's Choice
[51:34.670 --> 51:36.470]  from, through Gypsy.
[51:36.470 --> 51:37.310]  And-
[51:37.310 --> 51:39.550]  So that's the other one that I have going.
[51:39.550 --> 51:41.270]  Yes, and I did the same with that,
[51:41.270 --> 51:43.270]  is I open pollinated everything that was,
[51:43.270 --> 51:46.430]  and everything that came out of that was pretty good.
[51:46.430 --> 51:49.610]  So, and I didn't have, I had fewer to choose from,
[51:49.610 --> 51:50.590]  so it couldn't be picky.
[51:50.590 --> 51:53.470]  So there was a few males and a few females,
[51:53.470 --> 51:57.190]  open blew that and searched through those.
[51:57.190 --> 52:01.150]  And what I found in there was some amazing, amazing stuff.
[52:01.150 --> 52:05.350]  It was a lot of that cat pissy stuff.
[52:05.350 --> 52:09.150]  There was some like indescribable flavors in there.
[52:09.150 --> 52:12.390]  Like nothing, I wouldn't say it was like tropical,
[52:12.390 --> 52:14.550]  but that was the vibe that it got, gave me.
[52:14.550 --> 52:19.550]  There's just like a funky, like pirate sweat or something.
[52:20.110 --> 52:20.950]  I don't know.
[52:20.950 --> 52:22.550]  It was just like weird.
[52:22.550 --> 52:27.550]  Like, so yeah, this, but what I liked about those plants,
[52:29.510 --> 52:30.910]  well, let me talk about what I don't like
[52:30.910 --> 52:31.950]  about those plants first,
[52:31.950 --> 52:35.130]  is because I like so much about those Haystack skunk ones.
[52:35.130 --> 52:37.390]  What I don't like about the Haystack skunk one
[52:37.390 --> 52:40.550]  is that they're almost guaranteed to harm on you.
[52:40.550 --> 52:44.190]  Some harm later than others, but they are very hermy.
[52:44.190 --> 52:48.030]  And I'm not, this isn't a knock on Sam or anything like that,
[52:48.030 --> 52:49.190]  Dave, whatever.
[52:49.190 --> 52:54.190]  He, it's, I may have just, those original plants,
[52:55.070 --> 52:56.830]  I got one in there that just does it.
[52:56.830 --> 53:00.410]  And that's just the way that it is, but it is great smoke.
[53:00.410 --> 53:03.870]  And the ones that I really like are the string of pearl.
[53:03.870 --> 53:06.070]  Haze is like, there's just like a calyx,
[53:06.070 --> 53:07.750]  like calyx here, calyx there.
[53:07.750 --> 53:10.630]  And there's like a little bit of space in between them.
[53:10.630 --> 53:13.190]  And you just like, not that little,
[53:13.190 --> 53:15.850]  it's not even a nug, that little string up
[53:15.850 --> 53:17.190]  and shove it in your bowl.
[53:17.190 --> 53:19.270]  And it'll just send you to heaven.
[53:19.270 --> 53:20.750]  And it never stops.
[53:20.750 --> 53:23.750]  Like it's, I love those plants.
[53:23.750 --> 53:25.950]  And I found several of them like that in there.
[53:25.950 --> 53:27.430]  Cause you only keep them around so much
[53:27.430 --> 53:28.510]  cause you get so pissed off
[53:28.510 --> 53:31.150]  fucking picking herms out of them.
[53:31.150 --> 53:32.350]  But stuff like that, you know,
[53:32.350 --> 53:33.910]  it's not for the commercial guy,
[53:33.910 --> 53:35.830]  but it's for somebody who wants some head stash.
[53:35.830 --> 53:37.790]  You got somebody special coming over,
[53:37.790 --> 53:39.030]  you want to impress them?
[53:39.030 --> 53:41.710]  Here, get out the old man weed.
[53:41.710 --> 53:42.950]  Let's have some of that.
[53:43.190 --> 53:48.190]  So yeah, my favorite was the Haze x Skunk One.
[53:48.990 --> 53:50.950]  And that's enough sativa for me.
[53:50.950 --> 53:55.630]  Like I can only imagine what Toad's plants are like.
[53:55.630 --> 53:58.990]  That being pure hazes, like from that area and everything.
[53:58.990 --> 54:00.830]  It's like, I could only,
[54:00.830 --> 54:03.150]  they were probably like what I saw in that plant
[54:03.150 --> 54:04.310]  that I threw away at Shanti's.
[54:04.310 --> 54:08.310]  It was just like four inches between the nodes and shit.
[54:08.310 --> 54:09.790]  Should we ask them?
[54:09.790 --> 54:10.830]  Yeah, man.
[54:10.830 --> 54:12.150]  I love to talk to Toad.
[54:13.910 --> 54:14.750]  Up.
[54:16.550 --> 54:18.510]  Some of that NorCal internet.
[54:18.510 --> 54:20.110]  Yeah.
[54:20.110 --> 54:23.270]  That was his dramatic entry and it's a black screen.
[54:24.230 --> 54:26.350]  It seems like all the guys up there, man,
[54:26.350 --> 54:28.910]  they're really in, out there in it
[54:28.910 --> 54:31.390]  because they all have shitty internet, man.
[54:31.390 --> 54:33.470]  Like all the really good guys up there.
[54:33.470 --> 54:38.270]  Our dramatic entrance ruined by crappy internet.
[54:38.270 --> 54:41.310]  So you just see black below us, right?
[54:41.310 --> 54:42.470]  Yeah, that's all I see.
[54:43.070 --> 54:43.910]  Okay.
[54:43.910 --> 54:47.870]  Mr. Toad will be on shortly as soon as the, yeah,
[54:47.870 --> 54:48.710]  get in there.
[54:48.710 --> 54:51.430]  Get in there Toad.
[54:51.430 --> 54:53.350]  Everybody will his internet.
[54:54.510 --> 54:56.110]  Yeah, cause I'd like to see some,
[54:56.110 --> 54:58.950]  like ask him about some of the stuff that he's seen
[54:58.950 --> 55:00.590]  in those hazes, like,
[55:00.590 --> 55:02.550]  because he's seen the pure shit.
[55:05.510 --> 55:06.990]  Go to the end of the driveway.
[55:08.150 --> 55:11.550]  And the stuff that I started off on was NL Haze.
[55:11.550 --> 55:13.470]  And it's nice.
[55:13.470 --> 55:16.990]  Like my favorite plant out of there was called the dog shit.
[55:16.990 --> 55:19.950]  And it was just, it smelled like dog shit
[55:19.950 --> 55:22.870]  and it tasted like almost nothing,
[55:22.870 --> 55:25.350]  but it would just, oh, it'd annihilate you.
[55:26.470 --> 55:31.230]  It would give some people like a real bad anxiety attacks.
[55:31.230 --> 55:32.070]  Oh, here we go.
[55:32.070 --> 55:33.110]  We're gonna try it again.
[55:36.190 --> 55:37.310]  There's the Toad.
[55:38.270 --> 55:39.190]  Here we go.
[55:40.510 --> 55:41.350]  How y'all doing?
[55:41.350 --> 55:42.390]  What's up man?
[55:42.390 --> 55:44.110]  How you guys doing?
[55:44.110 --> 55:46.070]  All right, all right.
[55:46.070 --> 55:47.830]  So you had some questions.
[55:48.910 --> 55:51.230]  Oh, go ahead.
[55:52.710 --> 55:55.150]  You have questions for me or I have questions,
[55:55.150 --> 55:56.430]  the questions I have for him.
[55:56.430 --> 55:58.190]  You had a question for Mr. Toad
[55:58.190 --> 55:59.910]  and he was gonna make his dramatic entrance.
[55:59.910 --> 56:00.750]  Yes, yes.
[56:02.670 --> 56:06.190]  All right, your haze is like a pure haze
[56:06.190 --> 56:08.670]  from up in NorCal and all of that, right?
[56:08.670 --> 56:09.990]  Yes.
[56:09.990 --> 56:11.990]  Yeah, man, I got my haze in 2000.
[56:11.990 --> 56:13.110]  The one I'm using now,
[56:13.110 --> 56:16.550]  I got in 2011 through a trade with a girl that passed away.
[56:16.550 --> 56:19.470]  I traded her my milk and cookie strain
[56:19.470 --> 56:22.350]  and the Girl Scout cookie clone when it first came out.
[56:22.350 --> 56:24.590]  She hit me up and asked to do some trading.
[56:24.590 --> 56:27.150]  I've already bred with haze for years since 96.
[56:27.150 --> 56:28.910]  I've been using haze in some crosses.
[56:28.910 --> 56:31.110]  So when she gave it to me,
[56:31.110 --> 56:34.350]  I didn't wanna put a pure haze out like an F4 like I did.
[56:34.350 --> 56:36.230]  So I made a cross called my Space Tiva,
[56:36.230 --> 56:41.230]  which is the original haze F3 cross to my angel male.
[56:41.590 --> 56:44.390]  And that thing puts out 50% purple phenotypes
[56:44.390 --> 56:46.630]  out of that cross.
[56:46.630 --> 56:48.790]  The purple that comes out of the original haze,
[56:48.790 --> 56:50.550]  which is also known as the magenta
[56:50.550 --> 56:52.670]  or the first root beer strain.
[56:52.670 --> 56:54.710]  That was the line that pulls out
[56:54.710 --> 56:56.990]  and matches up quite well with my angel,
[56:56.990 --> 57:00.190]  which likes to drop a lot of color and do different lines.
[57:00.190 --> 57:02.670]  So that one's a three-way Colombian.
[57:02.710 --> 57:05.470]  It's the Punto Rojo, the magenta Colombian
[57:05.470 --> 57:09.670]  and a green, what they call the silver Colombian.
[57:09.670 --> 57:14.230]  It came over here and it was crossed to a Corella India tie.
[57:14.230 --> 57:17.390]  So that's the full genetic breakdown on mine.
[57:17.390 --> 57:19.990]  There's also hazes that are just that three-way haze.
[57:19.990 --> 57:23.510]  Then you've got hazes that added an Afghani to the mix.
[57:24.510 --> 57:27.830]  And then from there, you get the Northern Light five crosses,
[57:27.830 --> 57:31.690]  the Skunk One crosses, the Bat crosses that come in there
[57:31.690 --> 57:34.170]  that Neville talks about finding all the catfish strains
[57:34.170 --> 57:37.290]  out of when he starts making F2s and F3s out of the line.
[57:37.290 --> 57:39.610]  Some of the phenotypes start to pop out of there
[57:39.610 --> 57:41.690]  or you start finding like more of the,
[57:41.690 --> 57:43.170]  it'll be easier to line breed
[57:43.170 --> 57:44.650]  in different phenotype directions.
[57:44.650 --> 57:47.490]  Like you're saying that electric taste,
[57:47.490 --> 57:49.610]  it's almost metallic in your mouth.
[57:49.610 --> 57:53.650]  There's also some citrusy stuff that comes out.
[57:53.650 --> 57:57.330]  They're not gonna be like tangy or nothing,
[57:57.330 --> 58:00.810]  but they have a back note on top of all the other stuff
[58:00.810 --> 58:04.970]  we've talked about there, that pissy, incense-y, leathery.
[58:07.490 --> 58:10.810]  It's like raw meat almost, the way it comes through,
[58:10.810 --> 58:13.090]  like the way blood in your mouth, that metallic flavor.
[58:13.090 --> 58:13.930]  That's it's just crazy.
[58:13.930 --> 58:16.050]  Yeah, that's a great way to describe it.
[58:16.050 --> 58:16.890]  Yeah. Yeah.
[58:16.890 --> 58:18.890]  And I get that from like, when I passed it to a lot of,
[58:18.890 --> 58:21.770]  I have a lot of friends that are Ross from Virgin Islands
[58:21.770 --> 58:24.490]  and shit, a lot of the Bobos, when they smoke it,
[58:24.490 --> 58:26.490]  all they tell me is that it tastes like food.
[58:26.490 --> 58:28.370]  And that's what they keep bringing up out of there,
[58:28.370 --> 58:30.010]  that to them, it tastes like a food.
[58:30.610 --> 58:32.090]  It's so complex.
[58:32.090 --> 58:34.810]  That could be that spiciness that I was talking about.
[58:34.810 --> 58:35.850]  Like pirate sweat.
[58:35.850 --> 58:38.090]  It's like, it's really strange.
[58:38.090 --> 58:39.130]  It's weird.
[58:39.130 --> 58:41.330]  Haze is a complex line, man.
[58:41.330 --> 58:42.970]  What can come out of those crosses
[58:42.970 --> 58:44.690]  that came out of the original,
[58:44.690 --> 58:46.570]  and what was called pure haze,
[58:46.570 --> 58:48.330]  the Colombians are called pure hazes,
[58:48.330 --> 58:50.330]  and then brought here called original hazes.
[58:50.330 --> 58:52.810]  And then there's three different versions of that original
[58:52.810 --> 58:55.890]  that I know of, that I found track down to.
[58:55.890 --> 58:56.730]  And then from there,
[58:56.730 --> 58:58.130]  everybody starts breeding them into the nineties,
[58:58.130 --> 58:59.410]  and everyone in the nineties thinks
[58:59.410 --> 59:00.930]  all those hazes are pure hazes,
[59:00.930 --> 59:05.130]  like the PIF, the COF, the PUDE, church,
[59:05.130 --> 59:07.370]  all these plants, Frankie,
[59:07.370 --> 59:09.090]  they all think that those are pure hazes,
[59:09.090 --> 59:11.570]  when in fact, most of them are an NL five cross,
[59:11.570 --> 59:12.810]  or they've got the,
[59:12.810 --> 59:15.770]  which means they're a Afghani Hawaiian haze.
[59:15.770 --> 59:19.090]  And that's a extreme polyhybrid now, which they're killer.
[59:19.090 --> 59:21.370]  I mean, some of the best herb that's ever been found
[59:21.370 --> 59:22.330]  came out of those lines,
[59:22.330 --> 59:24.690]  but a lot of the newer people don't know
[59:24.690 --> 59:26.690]  that those aren't the true hazes.
[59:26.730 --> 59:28.970]  They just, those are hazes, right?
[59:28.970 --> 59:32.170]  And so everyone starts to think that those terpene profiles
[59:32.170 --> 59:34.850]  are the profiles that the real hazes carry.
[59:34.850 --> 59:37.650]  And some of those aren't like super silver haze.
[59:37.650 --> 59:39.530]  That isn't a pure haze selection.
[59:39.530 --> 59:41.050]  It's a hybrid.
[59:41.050 --> 59:45.050]  You've got a Neville's avian hybrid.
[59:45.050 --> 59:47.370]  When you throw in that NL five and then back cross on it,
[59:47.370 --> 59:49.530]  you start getting a lot of different structure,
[59:49.530 --> 59:51.010]  a lot of different terpene profiles
[59:51.010 --> 59:52.770]  that come out of that line.
[59:52.770 --> 59:53.810]  And they're all killer.
[59:53.810 --> 59:55.490]  So that's what's killer about being able
[59:55.490 --> 59:58.730]  to go back into a haze and work your way back
[59:58.730 --> 59:59.690]  to the future, right?
[59:59.690 --> 01:00:02.690]  Instead of starting with everybody else's cross,
[01:00:02.690 --> 01:00:04.810]  if you go into as far back as you can,
[01:00:04.810 --> 01:00:08.170]  you can start pulling out these spectacular lines
[01:00:08.170 --> 01:00:09.730]  that are going to be killer, man.
[01:00:09.730 --> 01:00:11.290]  Old herb is not bad.
[01:00:11.290 --> 01:00:14.330]  It was just harvested too early and sold to everybody
[01:00:14.330 --> 01:00:16.010]  because we wanted fucking weed beds.
[01:00:16.010 --> 01:00:17.610]  So they pressed it with all the seeds in it,
[01:00:17.610 --> 01:00:19.050]  shit sprayed all over it.
[01:00:19.050 --> 01:00:20.410]  It wasn't finished.
[01:00:20.410 --> 01:00:22.650]  And now we're taking the time to finish these plants out
[01:00:22.650 --> 01:00:25.330]  and we can find out what the true power of them is.
[01:00:26.170 --> 01:00:30.370]  My haze, the F3 mother, tested at 24% THC,
[01:00:30.370 --> 01:00:34.290]  4% CBD and 5.7 CBG.
[01:00:34.290 --> 01:00:37.810]  She's got an extremely wide cannabinoid profile
[01:00:37.810 --> 01:00:39.410]  compared to some of these other lines
[01:00:39.410 --> 01:00:43.170]  that even under full sun can't even hit like 22%.
[01:00:43.170 --> 01:00:45.330]  And then they don't have any terpenes to back them up.
[01:00:45.330 --> 01:00:48.050]  So you're just smoking out fucking rolled up wood.
[01:00:48.050 --> 01:00:48.890]  Yeah.
[01:00:48.890 --> 01:00:51.650]  Just straight hay.
[01:00:52.610 --> 01:00:54.290]  That's a lot of,
[01:00:54.290 --> 01:00:56.690]  found a lot of people that they think that that,
[01:00:56.690 --> 01:00:59.090]  if it's not Jack, it's not haze,
[01:00:59.090 --> 01:01:02.490]  or it's either haze that comes out like hay.
[01:01:02.490 --> 01:01:03.330]  Yeah.
[01:01:03.330 --> 01:01:04.930]  So it's kind of like you did with the black domino.
[01:01:04.930 --> 01:01:06.010]  If you don't do the research
[01:01:06.010 --> 01:01:09.050]  and find out there was multiple different versions of it
[01:01:09.050 --> 01:01:11.330]  done for specific reasons,
[01:01:11.330 --> 01:01:13.810]  you're just searching for a story that you either remember
[01:01:13.810 --> 01:01:15.250]  or someone told you,
[01:01:15.250 --> 01:01:17.210]  or that you're wishing that you could be the next guy
[01:01:17.210 --> 01:01:18.810]  to tell, right?
[01:01:18.810 --> 01:01:21.410]  For real, that's 90% of the cannabis community
[01:01:22.170 --> 01:01:23.290]  right now, everybody out here trying to push
[01:01:23.290 --> 01:01:26.210]  the next best thing that was the last thing we gave up.
[01:01:26.210 --> 01:01:28.410]  And it's not the same version of what we were even after.
[01:01:28.410 --> 01:01:30.010]  And people just buying into the bullshit
[01:01:30.010 --> 01:01:32.090]  and nobody does the research on it.
[01:01:32.090 --> 01:01:32.970]  Yeah.
[01:01:32.970 --> 01:01:35.090]  And they're chasing other people's flavors.
[01:01:35.090 --> 01:01:38.250]  It's like, they don't know that they have their own tastes.
[01:01:38.250 --> 01:01:39.250]  Exactly, man.
[01:01:39.250 --> 01:01:40.090]  Exactly.
[01:01:40.090 --> 01:01:43.090]  Like I'm a guy that doesn't like to smoke lavender
[01:01:43.090 --> 01:01:46.810]  or lemons or specifically green crack.
[01:01:46.810 --> 01:01:48.770]  Those are the strains that I don't get down with,
[01:01:48.770 --> 01:01:50.770]  but other people find them magnificent, right?
[01:01:50.810 --> 01:01:51.930]  And I know they're good.
[01:01:51.930 --> 01:01:55.810]  I've ran a collective that pushed medicinal properties
[01:01:55.810 --> 01:01:58.810]  of the plant instead of the THC numbers.
[01:01:58.810 --> 01:02:01.090]  So we know what plants work when I ran through there.
[01:02:01.090 --> 01:02:03.410]  So they do have potential with people.
[01:02:03.410 --> 01:02:05.130]  They also are antagonistic to others.
[01:02:05.130 --> 01:02:06.690]  That's how you find out,
[01:02:06.690 --> 01:02:10.610]  when you run 176 lines through 4,000 people,
[01:02:10.610 --> 01:02:12.690]  you eventually find out 10% of that population
[01:02:12.690 --> 01:02:13.770]  cannot handle this strain,
[01:02:13.770 --> 01:02:16.770]  no matter what 90% of them can, right?
[01:02:16.770 --> 01:02:18.850]  And that's how we need to be with this plant.
[01:02:18.850 --> 01:02:21.690]  We need to start steering it towards the medicinal side
[01:02:21.690 --> 01:02:24.970]  of by utilizing the information the patients bring
[01:02:24.970 --> 01:02:26.610]  instead of what that test number says.
[01:02:26.610 --> 01:02:28.570]  Cause that test number is really nothing.
[01:02:28.570 --> 01:02:30.530]  It's a very small percentage of a piece
[01:02:30.530 --> 01:02:32.250]  they took off the top of a plant.
[01:02:32.250 --> 01:02:33.810]  So you get the highest numbers.
[01:02:34.610 --> 01:02:36.890]  And then you're selling them the very bottom of the plant
[01:02:36.890 --> 01:02:38.850]  because that's all that's left on the jar, right?
[01:02:38.850 --> 01:02:40.650]  And that's just been packaged up for three months.
[01:02:40.650 --> 01:02:42.850]  It starts to age, the CBN number goes up,
[01:02:42.850 --> 01:02:45.010]  the terpene profile goes down.
[01:02:45.010 --> 01:02:46.530]  It's not what you said.
[01:02:46.530 --> 01:02:47.930]  And the person gets it and smokes it
[01:02:47.930 --> 01:02:50.330]  and they're pissed off because it don't taste good.
[01:02:50.330 --> 01:02:51.690]  The shit was harsh.
[01:02:51.690 --> 01:02:55.970]  And now they've already started off on a bad foothold, right?
[01:02:55.970 --> 01:02:57.490]  So they already started off negatively.
[01:02:57.490 --> 01:02:58.410]  So now everywhere they go,
[01:02:58.410 --> 01:03:00.410]  that line doesn't have a medicinal effect to them
[01:03:00.410 --> 01:03:03.770]  because the first place sold them some fucking meds
[01:03:03.770 --> 01:03:04.890]  or some rolled up wood,
[01:03:04.890 --> 01:03:06.250]  whatever you want to call this shit,
[01:03:06.250 --> 01:03:09.290]  instead of being prideful in the fact
[01:03:09.290 --> 01:03:12.250]  that they're using medicine to sell to these patients.
[01:03:12.250 --> 01:03:13.330]  Unless you're in the rec market,
[01:03:13.330 --> 01:03:14.610]  and then that's a whole different story.
[01:03:14.610 --> 01:03:16.650]  Go ahead and smoke on your vapes,
[01:03:16.690 --> 01:03:17.530]  puffed and vapes.
[01:03:17.530 --> 01:03:18.370]  Yeah.
[01:03:18.370 --> 01:03:19.210]  Yeah.
[01:03:19.210 --> 01:03:20.050]  Yeah.
[01:03:20.050 --> 01:03:20.890]  Pins are ridiculous.
[01:03:21.890 --> 01:03:22.730]  All right.
[01:03:22.730 --> 01:03:25.490]  So going back to the thing you showed at the beginning
[01:03:25.490 --> 01:03:26.890]  with the chromosomes.
[01:03:26.890 --> 01:03:28.770]  Yeah, I sent pictures to Peter.
[01:03:28.770 --> 01:03:31.330]  He could show up here that shows that the male chromosome
[01:03:31.330 --> 01:03:33.610]  in cannabis is larger than the female.
[01:03:33.610 --> 01:03:38.250]  The mega base on a male cannabis is 843 mega base.
[01:03:38.250 --> 01:03:41.370]  And the mega base for females is 814, I believe,
[01:03:41.370 --> 01:03:42.770]  or it's 818.
[01:03:42.770 --> 01:03:43.970]  So in cannabis,
[01:03:43.970 --> 01:03:48.650]  males offer a larger potential for the genetic coding
[01:03:48.650 --> 01:03:49.930]  that's in that line.
[01:03:49.930 --> 01:03:51.690]  So there's a possibility that the purple
[01:03:51.690 --> 01:03:54.610]  or the mutation in the leaf is coming from the male side
[01:03:54.610 --> 01:03:56.570]  and you're breeding it through females.
[01:03:56.570 --> 01:03:58.010]  And it's never showing up
[01:03:58.010 --> 01:04:01.810]  because it's highly recessive on the males gamuts.
[01:04:01.810 --> 01:04:05.010]  So in cannabis, the male is larger.
[01:04:05.010 --> 01:04:07.730]  It's not very much larger, but it's larger.
[01:04:08.810 --> 01:04:09.770]  Huh?
[01:04:09.770 --> 01:04:11.650]  That's interesting.
[01:04:11.650 --> 01:04:14.530]  I thought that it correlated to the same as ours.
[01:04:14.530 --> 01:04:16.650]  No, I sent it over to Peter.
[01:04:16.650 --> 01:04:19.730]  It's in the lines on the Gmail.
[01:04:19.730 --> 01:04:21.170]  It says mega base.
[01:04:21.170 --> 01:04:22.570]  There's two pictures.
[01:04:22.570 --> 01:04:24.810]  Yeah, I'm going there.
[01:04:24.810 --> 01:04:28.570]  That's just so people know I'm not just making shit up.
[01:04:28.570 --> 01:04:31.210]  I do like to show a little bit of information with it.
[01:04:31.210 --> 01:04:33.570]  So, and it's not to bust nobody out, man.
[01:04:33.570 --> 01:04:35.930]  It's just to pass the information.
[01:04:35.930 --> 01:04:38.210]  The fact that the males carry more information
[01:04:38.210 --> 01:04:40.210]  and a majority of our breeding is done
[01:04:40.250 --> 01:04:43.010]  through feminized seeds these days with auto flowers
[01:04:43.010 --> 01:04:45.530]  and with everybody deciding they don't want to give you
[01:04:45.530 --> 01:04:48.330]  the male to breed with because they know for a fact
[01:04:48.330 --> 01:04:51.330]  that when they offer you a female that's been S1
[01:04:51.330 --> 01:04:54.410]  it's an F2 version that's being line bred.
[01:04:54.410 --> 01:04:56.250]  And you're not getting the full expression
[01:04:56.250 --> 01:04:58.250]  of that genetic possibility.
[01:04:58.250 --> 01:05:01.250]  You're basically getting sold only half the line, man.
[01:05:01.250 --> 01:05:05.130]  And only one phenotypes expression of that line.
[01:05:05.130 --> 01:05:06.850]  When you could do an open population of
[01:05:06.850 --> 01:05:09.850]  with as many males and as many females of that line
[01:05:10.490 --> 01:05:13.450]  and offer that to people or start breeding true F1s.
[01:05:13.450 --> 01:05:15.170]  Like we're not breeding true F1s out here.
[01:05:15.170 --> 01:05:18.130]  Most of us are passing off polyhybrids to people
[01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:20.170]  and everyone's expecting true breeding lines
[01:05:20.170 --> 01:05:22.330]  out of these things and they can't do it.
[01:05:22.330 --> 01:05:24.850]  The cannabis offers 30,000 gamuts to pass
[01:05:24.850 --> 01:05:26.370]  when it breeds each time.
[01:05:26.370 --> 01:05:31.050]  And I guarantee you, I can't even give you 30 of them
[01:05:31.050 --> 01:05:32.930]  that I can list off the top of my head
[01:05:32.930 --> 01:05:34.970]  that are gonna be the same in every plant.
[01:05:34.970 --> 01:05:37.650]  Everybody wants a plant not to be a morphodite
[01:05:37.650 --> 01:05:40.090]  when it's driven through endogenous hormones.
[01:05:40.090 --> 01:05:41.730]  So if I switch up the heat in the room
[01:05:41.730 --> 01:05:43.810]  or how much water I put on the plant
[01:05:43.810 --> 01:05:48.010]  or one night my heater goes out and it's cold that night.
[01:05:48.010 --> 01:05:50.690]  All these things are what's affecting that plant's
[01:05:50.690 --> 01:05:53.130]  phenotypical expression in that environment.
[01:05:53.130 --> 01:05:56.770]  And the more you run a plant from seed in that environment
[01:05:56.770 --> 01:05:58.930]  instead of running it in that environment
[01:05:58.930 --> 01:06:01.970]  till it's acclimated and then taking cuttings
[01:06:01.970 --> 01:06:04.010]  and running the cuttings off of that mom.
[01:06:04.010 --> 01:06:06.250]  You don't even have an idea of how that plant's
[01:06:06.250 --> 01:06:08.650]  truly expressing itself in your environment.
[01:06:08.650 --> 01:06:10.010]  And then you should take cuttings and run it
[01:06:10.010 --> 01:06:13.690]  in another environment to verify what you believe is true.
[01:06:13.690 --> 01:06:16.530]  Otherwise you just, it's the guessing game.
[01:06:16.530 --> 01:06:18.010]  That's where pro science comes from.
[01:06:18.010 --> 01:06:21.450]  We keep, we just keep deciding that what we see
[01:06:21.450 --> 01:06:24.490]  and this particular moment of time is the facts
[01:06:24.490 --> 01:06:27.450]  of what's happening instead of diving in to find out again
[01:06:27.450 --> 01:06:29.370]  like what you did with black domino.
[01:06:29.370 --> 01:06:33.290]  If I decide that the black domino fifth generation
[01:06:33.290 --> 01:06:36.010]  has this clone or this genetics and I stick to it
[01:06:36.770 --> 01:06:37.610]  and I never decide to check,
[01:06:37.610 --> 01:06:39.810]  I never find out that what I believed was in it
[01:06:39.810 --> 01:06:42.290]  actually wasn't in it and it was another line, right?
[01:06:42.290 --> 01:06:44.730]  I'm just stuck on stupid with the information I wanted to
[01:06:44.730 --> 01:06:47.890]  know instead of finding out the information that's truly
[01:06:47.890 --> 01:06:49.850]  out there and you're not gonna find it in one form.
[01:06:49.850 --> 01:06:52.210]  You gotta dive into multiple forms.
[01:06:52.210 --> 01:06:54.010]  You need to dive into multiple stories.
[01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:56.810]  The same person told to see if you ever switched it up,
[01:06:56.810 --> 01:06:59.170]  find out what's really going on with the plant.
[01:06:59.170 --> 01:07:01.690]  We putting people on pedestals and the stories that they have
[01:07:01.690 --> 01:07:03.610]  is the actual bedrock.
[01:07:03.610 --> 01:07:05.650]  That's the foundation to that story.
[01:07:06.290 --> 01:07:08.890]  The plants, the actual roots that started everything.
[01:07:08.890 --> 01:07:11.890]  Find out the actual facts of what they're passing around.
[01:07:11.890 --> 01:07:15.170]  If one year all of a sudden the story fucking changes,
[01:07:15.170 --> 01:07:16.850]  chances are the story changed, right?
[01:07:16.850 --> 01:07:18.530]  There wasn't right in the first place, right?
[01:07:18.530 --> 01:07:21.050]  All of a sudden, some of you got too high,
[01:07:21.050 --> 01:07:23.330]  you know, the plant's gonna tell you like with hazes,
[01:07:23.330 --> 01:07:26.370]  they're gonna be thin leaved, extremely long flower,
[01:07:26.370 --> 01:07:29.330]  tall as a son of a bitch, hard to control indoors.
[01:07:30.210 --> 01:07:33.570]  They're gonna come out like some shit you didn't wanna
[01:07:33.570 --> 01:07:35.170]  smoke indoors until you smoke them
[01:07:35.170 --> 01:07:37.210]  and then you're gonna wonder why all these other plants
[01:07:37.210 --> 01:07:38.850]  look like they do, but don't affect me
[01:07:38.850 --> 01:07:40.250]  the way this one does.
[01:07:40.250 --> 01:07:42.770]  And it's because we keep breeding for our eyes
[01:07:42.770 --> 01:07:45.690]  and bag of pill and test numbers that come up
[01:07:45.690 --> 01:07:49.650]  that can be swayed instead of testing based on like,
[01:07:49.650 --> 01:07:51.050]  close your eyes and smoke this shit.
[01:07:51.050 --> 01:07:52.490]  Did your pain go away?
[01:07:52.490 --> 01:07:54.530]  And like a half hour later, everybody comes back
[01:07:54.530 --> 01:07:56.490]  saying like, what the fuck did you give me?
[01:07:56.490 --> 01:07:58.770]  Right, and you're like, well, this is what I use
[01:07:58.770 --> 01:08:00.530]  for this specific ailment.
[01:08:00.530 --> 01:08:02.570]  This is the name of it.
[01:08:02.570 --> 01:08:04.010]  If you need it, we have it.
[01:08:04.050 --> 01:08:05.210]  It's also another club.
[01:08:05.210 --> 01:08:07.370]  So go over there, like that's what we used to do.
[01:08:07.370 --> 01:08:08.930]  When people came in and didn't have money,
[01:08:08.930 --> 01:08:10.690]  we'd give them what we thought worked.
[01:08:10.690 --> 01:08:11.890]  Once they found out what worked,
[01:08:11.890 --> 01:08:13.570]  then we'd start charging them for it, right?
[01:08:13.570 --> 01:08:16.090]  We didn't wanna charge broke sick people for shit
[01:08:16.090 --> 01:08:18.770]  that might've made their fucking condition worse.
[01:08:18.770 --> 01:08:20.890]  This is how I found out which medicinal.
[01:08:20.890 --> 01:08:24.570]  And it's also called like, I tell everyone,
[01:08:24.570 --> 01:08:26.610]  it comes from the fact that I lost so many people
[01:08:26.610 --> 01:08:29.610]  that died from cancer or drinking or in a wreck
[01:08:29.610 --> 01:08:33.490]  or some shit, now myself being two thirds of a human,
[01:08:33.930 --> 01:08:35.850]  because I lost so much of my body parts, right?
[01:08:35.850 --> 01:08:37.450]  It's reality.
[01:08:37.450 --> 01:08:39.210]  There's someone out there dying from the condition
[01:08:39.210 --> 01:08:40.490]  you're pretending you're helping them with.
[01:08:40.490 --> 01:08:42.490]  And when you're telling them it's couch lock
[01:08:42.490 --> 01:08:46.170]  or it's gonna get you an upper high, you're full of shit.
[01:08:46.170 --> 01:08:47.970]  That has nothing to do with the dude
[01:08:47.970 --> 01:08:49.410]  who's got a traumatic brain injury,
[01:08:49.410 --> 01:08:51.890]  who's having fucking seizures 12 times a day.
[01:08:51.890 --> 01:08:54.170]  And you just read in a book that Bubba might work
[01:08:54.170 --> 01:08:55.290]  because it's an indica.
[01:08:55.290 --> 01:08:58.650]  Find out which lines work by offering it to people
[01:08:58.650 --> 01:09:00.450]  or doing your research and finding out
[01:09:00.450 --> 01:09:02.010]  which lines really did work.
[01:09:02.050 --> 01:09:04.530]  Do a medicinal breakdown on these things
[01:09:04.530 --> 01:09:06.730]  instead of a marketing breakdown.
[01:09:06.730 --> 01:09:08.530]  When you do a marketing breakdown, it's easy.
[01:09:08.530 --> 01:09:10.770]  All you gotta do is put the hypest name on the strain,
[01:09:10.770 --> 01:09:12.490]  cross it to some shit people read about
[01:09:12.490 --> 01:09:13.690]  and you sell them out, right?
[01:09:13.690 --> 01:09:14.570]  Every fucking day.
[01:09:14.570 --> 01:09:17.690]  And we have no proof that these things do anything but sell.
[01:09:17.690 --> 01:09:18.530]  Yeah.
[01:09:18.530 --> 01:09:19.890]  And that's why I went for that lifesaver
[01:09:19.890 --> 01:09:21.970]  because I saw that change a man's life.
[01:09:21.970 --> 01:09:24.130]  I know that it eases pain.
[01:09:24.130 --> 01:09:26.930]  So my back hurts, I'm going for the lifesaver.
[01:09:26.930 --> 01:09:30.290]  So thank you James Bean for putting that out there, man.
[01:09:31.130 --> 01:09:31.970]  Yeah.
[01:09:31.970 --> 01:09:33.250]  And Bog, of course, RIP Bog.
[01:09:33.250 --> 01:09:35.810]  There's a reason Bog made it as far as he did.
[01:09:35.810 --> 01:09:38.170]  And it wasn't because the seeds were hype.
[01:09:38.170 --> 01:09:40.530]  It was because the man put in the time
[01:09:40.530 --> 01:09:43.810]  when he was here with us to find out what the line did.
[01:09:43.810 --> 01:09:44.850]  He broke his lines down.
[01:09:44.850 --> 01:09:46.170]  He told you how they were gonna grow,
[01:09:46.170 --> 01:09:47.730]  how they were gonna smell.
[01:09:47.730 --> 01:09:50.330]  He didn't have to show you some fucking fancy picture.
[01:09:50.330 --> 01:09:52.850]  His information that he had in his head through experience
[01:09:52.850 --> 01:09:54.850]  was able to do that for him.
[01:09:54.850 --> 01:09:56.650]  You know, well, I know, but like,
[01:09:56.650 --> 01:09:59.690]  he really only paid attention to the guy after a while
[01:09:59.730 --> 01:10:01.330]  because he was right about the information
[01:10:01.330 --> 01:10:02.530]  he was passing to you.
[01:10:02.530 --> 01:10:04.610]  He didn't write a book that was full of shit.
[01:10:04.610 --> 01:10:07.850]  He wasn't on the forums telling you cow mag all fucking day.
[01:10:07.850 --> 01:10:09.730]  He was still asking you the question.
[01:10:09.730 --> 01:10:11.090]  And then he'd pass you the answer
[01:10:11.090 --> 01:10:13.370]  just because he had a bag over his head in the picture
[01:10:13.370 --> 01:10:15.330]  didn't mean he was hiding from you.
[01:10:15.330 --> 01:10:18.050]  It just meant that the laws where he's at
[01:10:18.050 --> 01:10:20.210]  and the way he feels about them,
[01:10:20.210 --> 01:10:21.930]  this is some clown shoes type of shit.
[01:10:21.930 --> 01:10:23.610]  So right, he puts a bag on his head,
[01:10:23.610 --> 01:10:24.890]  shows that as his picture,
[01:10:24.890 --> 01:10:26.850]  but puts in the time and information
[01:10:26.850 --> 01:10:28.410]  to pass to another person that could,
[01:10:28.410 --> 01:10:29.770]  they could do the same fucking thing.
[01:10:29.770 --> 01:10:31.650]  Exactly, homie, don't play that shit.
[01:10:31.650 --> 01:10:34.050]  It's called 22s and Us.
[01:10:34.050 --> 01:10:35.490]  It's a size 22s.
[01:10:35.490 --> 01:10:36.810]  I say it to everyone.
[01:10:36.810 --> 01:10:38.650]  When anyone's acting like a fucking clown,
[01:10:38.650 --> 01:10:40.890]  I tell them it's the size 22 crew.
[01:10:40.890 --> 01:10:42.210]  These motherfuckers don't stop.
[01:10:42.210 --> 01:10:45.090]  They're gonna push the prettiest packaging they can on you
[01:10:45.090 --> 01:10:47.050]  with the new famous name.
[01:10:47.050 --> 01:10:51.330]  And that line has no real proof
[01:10:51.330 --> 01:10:53.610]  that it's done fucking anything but sell, right?
[01:10:53.610 --> 01:10:55.330]  You got bog that's been out there for years
[01:10:55.330 --> 01:10:58.770]  with lines that have done what they say they can do
[01:10:58.770 --> 01:11:00.930]  medicinally plus breeding potential.
[01:11:00.930 --> 01:11:03.290]  Like how many lines have came from crosses
[01:11:03.290 --> 01:11:05.810]  that bog made or other breeders that now
[01:11:05.810 --> 01:11:09.050]  are in somebody else's stuff that makes it farther, right?
[01:11:09.050 --> 01:11:11.130]  Some people will breed with some shit you never heard of.
[01:11:11.130 --> 01:11:12.290]  It doesn't never go nowhere.
[01:11:12.290 --> 01:11:13.330]  You never know what it is.
[01:11:13.330 --> 01:11:15.330]  It's nothing, but like the haze,
[01:11:15.330 --> 01:11:17.210]  it's been in so many different lines.
[01:11:17.210 --> 01:11:19.370]  It's one of the lines that is probably
[01:11:19.370 --> 01:11:22.010]  in everything you smoked at some little bit of form,
[01:11:22.010 --> 01:11:24.250]  kind of like Afghanis and Northern Lights number one,
[01:11:24.250 --> 01:11:25.810]  because of all the breeding people did
[01:11:25.810 --> 01:11:29.090]  with these plants that truly were spectacular
[01:11:29.090 --> 01:11:31.030]  and better than everything else around them.
[01:11:31.030 --> 01:11:32.290]  That's why they're in them.
[01:11:32.290 --> 01:11:35.330]  That's why people took that plant and backcrossed,
[01:11:35.330 --> 01:11:38.010]  like they backcrossed into haze multiple times
[01:11:38.010 --> 01:11:39.730]  with Northern Lights and with skunk.
[01:11:39.730 --> 01:11:40.850]  And there's a reason they did that.
[01:11:40.850 --> 01:11:42.050]  They were trying to control the height
[01:11:42.050 --> 01:11:43.330]  and bring down the flower time,
[01:11:43.330 --> 01:11:47.090]  but they were trying to retain the power of the haze plant
[01:11:47.090 --> 01:11:49.410]  and not bring in the power from the Afghani
[01:11:49.410 --> 01:11:51.330]  or from the skunk that was there.
[01:11:51.330 --> 01:11:54.170]  They were trying to keep as much of that haze
[01:11:55.090 --> 01:11:56.570]  as they could, but reduce the flower time,
[01:11:56.570 --> 01:11:57.610]  make it easier to grow.
[01:11:57.610 --> 01:11:59.130]  And so they used lines that they knew
[01:11:59.130 --> 01:12:01.290]  that were fast finishers, easier to grow
[01:12:01.290 --> 01:12:03.530]  with a denser structure that had some
[01:12:03.530 --> 01:12:05.410]  of the similar profiles that they were finding
[01:12:05.410 --> 01:12:06.770]  in those haze plants.
[01:12:06.770 --> 01:12:08.330]  So that's how you go through breeding.
[01:12:08.330 --> 01:12:10.170]  That's how a person with experience finds out
[01:12:10.170 --> 01:12:12.770]  that I can take these plants, mix them with these plants,
[01:12:12.770 --> 01:12:14.650]  and I'm gonna get this result.
[01:12:14.650 --> 01:12:16.410]  Or you don't know jack shit.
[01:12:16.410 --> 01:12:18.050]  You just start crossing shit with names
[01:12:18.050 --> 01:12:20.330]  and your profiles don't come out.
[01:12:20.330 --> 01:12:22.530]  So you name something orange and it comes out, right?
[01:12:22.530 --> 01:12:24.970]  Cause you didn't know shit about the parents.
[01:12:24.970 --> 01:12:25.810]  Yeah.
[01:12:25.810 --> 01:12:29.250]  And I think that's why that haze time skunk one
[01:12:29.250 --> 01:12:31.850]  came out so well is because there's a lot of sativa
[01:12:31.850 --> 01:12:32.890]  in that skunk one.
[01:12:32.890 --> 01:12:34.330]  There's Columbia and the Mexican.
[01:12:34.330 --> 01:12:37.050]  It's almost like back into itself
[01:12:37.050 --> 01:12:39.130]  with a little bit of Afghan to knock it back.
[01:12:39.130 --> 01:12:43.490]  Just enough, just enough to where you can manage it.
[01:12:43.490 --> 01:12:47.810]  I've got some pictures of the skunk from 78 in here.
[01:12:47.810 --> 01:12:52.450]  These guys, Mad Jag, Mad Jaguar was his name.
[01:12:53.370 --> 01:12:54.210]  He went by Mad Jag.
[01:12:54.210 --> 01:12:56.170]  He bought 3000 seeds from Robert Clark
[01:12:56.170 --> 01:13:00.690]  and skunk man Sam in 1978 through 1980.
[01:13:00.690 --> 01:13:02.530]  And he was running them in Arizona
[01:13:02.530 --> 01:13:05.930]  and all the plants he grew there were tall, long, and lanky.
[01:13:05.930 --> 01:13:08.610]  None of them were short and wide, none of them.
[01:13:08.610 --> 01:13:10.890]  And when Robert Clark showed back up to the garden
[01:13:10.890 --> 01:13:12.610]  to check the grow there,
[01:13:12.610 --> 01:13:15.290]  what they brought up was that he never once brought up
[01:13:15.290 --> 01:13:18.050]  roadkill for any type of terpene profile description.
[01:13:18.050 --> 01:13:19.130]  There was just always skunk.
[01:13:19.130 --> 01:13:21.730]  They had skunk one and skunk two at that time.
[01:13:22.050 --> 01:13:25.610]  They were growing out a batch of 3000 seeds from these guys.
[01:13:25.610 --> 01:13:27.490]  And none of the skunks at that time
[01:13:27.490 --> 01:13:29.650]  looked like short wide plants.
[01:13:29.650 --> 01:13:31.570]  So I also believe what you're saying.
[01:13:31.570 --> 01:13:33.370]  They took that skunk from the early days
[01:13:33.370 --> 01:13:34.970]  to cross into the haze
[01:13:34.970 --> 01:13:37.770]  because it was very similar in structure,
[01:13:37.770 --> 01:13:39.570]  but it was very, very fast.
[01:13:39.570 --> 01:13:41.290]  So they were in structure.
[01:13:41.290 --> 01:13:43.970]  It looked like a miniature version of a haze, right?
[01:13:43.970 --> 01:13:45.890]  The plant didn't get 25 feet,
[01:13:45.890 --> 01:13:50.370]  but the bud structure was a real long running flower.
[01:13:50.410 --> 01:13:52.490]  It wasn't these short nodules.
[01:13:52.490 --> 01:13:54.970]  They were trying to retain as much of the haze as they could
[01:13:54.970 --> 01:13:58.450]  and bring that time down 100%.
[01:13:58.450 --> 01:13:59.570]  Let me see if I can find it.
[01:13:59.570 --> 01:14:01.050]  It's right in here.
[01:14:01.050 --> 01:14:03.490]  I just showed them the other day on my live feed.
[01:14:04.370 --> 01:14:06.770]  It's right after.
[01:14:06.770 --> 01:14:09.170]  I think another mistake that people make with the haze
[01:14:09.170 --> 01:14:11.730]  that they get a bad impression from it
[01:14:11.730 --> 01:14:14.090]  is that they try to cure it too fast.
[01:14:14.090 --> 01:14:17.050]  I've found that if you let it sit just a little bit.
[01:14:17.050 --> 01:14:20.450]  These are skunk buds from 1978.
[01:14:21.930 --> 01:14:24.810]  These plants are not short and wide and fat.
[01:14:24.810 --> 01:14:26.770]  These are long running sativa style,
[01:14:26.770 --> 01:14:28.250]  what people call sativa.
[01:14:28.250 --> 01:14:32.690]  I just call long narrow leafed type one plants.
[01:14:32.690 --> 01:14:35.330]  I don't use indica sativa to describe my plants.
[01:14:36.290 --> 01:14:39.170]  Yeah, that long thin stack.
[01:14:39.170 --> 01:14:40.690]  Yeah, there's also some photos.
[01:14:40.690 --> 01:14:42.930]  Like here's some more here of them in veg
[01:14:42.930 --> 01:14:45.270]  showing just going into flower.
[01:14:47.570 --> 01:14:48.810]  Let's see what else are here.
[01:14:48.810 --> 01:14:53.570]  This is showing you the date on the timestamp, 79 to 80.
[01:14:54.810 --> 01:14:56.450]  And if you'll read the top there,
[01:14:56.450 --> 01:14:59.930]  it says, Mad Jack Chronicles, Sacred Seeds,
[01:14:59.930 --> 01:15:04.570]  skunk version number one, V2, Sacred Seeds.
[01:15:04.570 --> 01:15:09.570]  And he bought the seeds from Sam and Robert Connell Clark
[01:15:09.570 --> 01:15:12.730]  who were both in Sacred Seeds as members.
[01:15:12.730 --> 01:15:15.610]  So a lot of people don't believe any of that shit,
[01:15:15.610 --> 01:15:17.250]  but this is a man that was making,
[01:15:17.250 --> 01:15:18.890]  he made this post just to have this.
[01:15:18.890 --> 01:15:20.730]  Sam was not in it until later,
[01:15:20.730 --> 01:15:22.810]  much later in this conversation.
[01:15:22.810 --> 01:15:25.050]  He shows up like 12 pages later
[01:15:25.050 --> 01:15:28.610]  and actually the two stories merge and become the same.
[01:15:28.610 --> 01:15:30.130]  It wasn't Sam telling this story.
[01:15:30.130 --> 01:15:32.930]  It was another dude telling the story of the skunk seeds
[01:15:32.930 --> 01:15:35.610]  that he bought in 79, right?
[01:15:35.610 --> 01:15:38.050]  People are talking about skunk in 1990.
[01:15:38.050 --> 01:15:41.970]  So now we got a skunk that's 20 years prior, it's earlier.
[01:15:41.970 --> 01:15:45.010]  This thing is coming out and people have not had it
[01:15:45.010 --> 01:15:46.530]  that were smoking in the-
[01:15:49.900 --> 01:15:54.220]  Yeah, and that would be before the Sacred Seeds catalog
[01:15:54.220 --> 01:15:56.260]  that was published in High Times too.
[01:15:57.180 --> 01:15:59.820]  Like there's the one that R-
[01:15:59.820 --> 01:16:00.660]  79.
[01:16:00.660 --> 01:16:02.660]  I always thought that was R. Clark.
[01:16:02.660 --> 01:16:03.500]  That-
[01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:05.340]  Yeah, R. Clark, it's Robert Connell Clark.
[01:16:05.340 --> 01:16:08.380]  Yeah, and he posted that Sacred Seeds catalog
[01:16:08.380 --> 01:16:10.420]  in the old High Times magazine.
[01:16:10.420 --> 01:16:11.260]  Yep.
[01:16:11.260 --> 01:16:12.580]  And that was like in the early 80s, 81,
[01:16:12.580 --> 01:16:13.620]  something like that.
[01:16:13.620 --> 01:16:17.940]  And then there was the later one that Dave put out, correct?
[01:16:18.820 --> 01:16:19.660]  Yeah, Dave put out one-
[01:16:19.660 --> 01:16:21.300]  This predates both of those.
[01:16:21.300 --> 01:16:22.140]  Like he's saying that he got-
[01:16:22.140 --> 01:16:23.180]  And then there's also one that's done
[01:16:23.180 --> 01:16:27.140]  by a dude named Rosenbaum that wrote for High Times.
[01:16:27.140 --> 01:16:29.940]  And he puts out a mock catalog
[01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:32.020]  that he took from other catalogs at the time.
[01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:33.420]  I'm trying to find it right now.
[01:16:33.420 --> 01:16:36.300]  That shows skunk one and skunk two, the Afghanis
[01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:39.500]  and a bunch of different hazes in early seven,
[01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:40.620]  I believe it's 78.
[01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:42.700]  I have the catalog here.
[01:16:42.700 --> 01:16:44.380]  I have the High Times here.
[01:16:44.380 --> 01:16:45.220]  I took a picture of it.
[01:16:45.220 --> 01:16:48.140]  That's what I'm trying to pull up right now.
[01:16:48.140 --> 01:16:49.500]  I've got that old High Times too.
[01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:51.660]  I inherited a nice little stack, man.
[01:16:51.660 --> 01:16:53.500]  I've learned a lot from those.
[01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:54.460]  A lot of bullshit.
[01:16:54.460 --> 01:16:55.580]  Yeah, that's it.
[01:16:55.580 --> 01:16:58.620]  If you look real close, the very time I enlarge it,
[01:16:58.620 --> 01:17:01.300]  the top one has the Afghani one, Afghani two,
[01:17:01.300 --> 01:17:04.540]  Afghani number two, purple, skunk one, and skunk two.
[01:17:04.540 --> 01:17:05.580]  And then when you go down below,
[01:17:05.580 --> 01:17:08.700]  there's the South Indian number one, number two,
[01:17:08.700 --> 01:17:12.580]  number three, original haze, one, two, three, and four.
[01:17:13.460 --> 01:17:14.300]  And then the burning bush.
[01:17:14.300 --> 01:17:16.900]  Then in between, you've got Nepali and Malawi.
[01:17:16.900 --> 01:17:19.580]  This is an old catalog, man.
[01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:21.940]  People just don't understand what they're talking about
[01:17:21.940 --> 01:17:23.420]  when they start talking about the bullshit
[01:17:23.420 --> 01:17:25.140]  they're talking about.
[01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:27.700]  You can go back and predate all the information
[01:17:27.700 --> 01:17:28.860]  a lot of people are talking about
[01:17:28.860 --> 01:17:30.740]  and back it up through multiple stories.
[01:17:30.740 --> 01:17:32.260]  If you're willing to do the time,
[01:17:32.260 --> 01:17:34.680]  like while your plants are growing for those three months,
[01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:37.380]  go read a book, go dive into some shit.
[01:17:37.380 --> 01:17:39.940]  Do something besides read memes, homies.
[01:17:39.940 --> 01:17:41.340]  Like a meme ain't gonna tell you shit
[01:17:41.340 --> 01:17:43.620]  other than you like memes, bro.
[01:17:43.620 --> 01:17:45.620]  Yeah, go find out some shit.
[01:17:45.620 --> 01:17:48.140]  And Rosenbaum writes for Newsweek, I believe it is,
[01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:49.100]  or Time Magazine.
[01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:51.420]  Rosenbaum that wrote for High Times
[01:17:51.420 --> 01:17:53.140]  is the same writer that writes,
[01:17:53.140 --> 01:17:55.700]  he's a Pulitzer Prize winner,
[01:17:55.700 --> 01:17:56.740]  I think that's what it's called.
[01:17:56.740 --> 01:18:01.020]  He's won, he's had accolades for being a writer.
[01:18:01.020 --> 01:18:03.420]  The information he put out wasn't bullshit.
[01:18:03.420 --> 01:18:05.980]  Even though it's in a magazine that was for entertainment.
[01:18:05.980 --> 01:18:08.060]  You can find the facts in the stories
[01:18:08.060 --> 01:18:09.300]  that they told back in the days
[01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:11.220]  if you just dive in hard enough.
[01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:12.900]  Well, you just taught me something, man,
[01:18:12.900 --> 01:18:15.980]  because I always thought R was Robert Clark, not Rosenbaum.
[01:18:15.980 --> 01:18:16.820]  Everyone thought it was.
[01:18:16.820 --> 01:18:17.660]  It's Robert.
[01:18:17.660 --> 01:18:18.900]  There's a lot of people there, man.
[01:18:18.900 --> 01:18:20.340]  I have shown that, I've proven it.
[01:18:20.340 --> 01:18:21.820]  His name's Rosenbaum, Rob.
[01:18:21.820 --> 01:18:24.140]  I think it's Robert Rosenbaum.
[01:18:24.140 --> 01:18:27.260]  No, I always thought that it was Rob Clark.
[01:18:27.260 --> 01:18:28.940]  No, that's how I found it.
[01:18:28.940 --> 01:18:30.300]  A ton of people thought that.
[01:18:30.300 --> 01:18:32.720]  Then I found Robert Clark said, it's not me, bro.
[01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:33.560]  I didn't write it.
[01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:35.140]  I found that in the forums.
[01:18:35.140 --> 01:18:35.980]  Awesome.
[01:18:35.980 --> 01:18:38.060]  And some other guy brings up Rosenbaum.
[01:18:38.060 --> 01:18:40.780]  He's like, I always wondered if it was Rosenbaum.
[01:18:41.300 --> 01:18:42.700]  And then I find Rosenbaum admitting
[01:18:42.700 --> 01:18:45.180]  he was the author of those articles.
[01:18:45.180 --> 01:18:47.380]  And he used to title it RR.
[01:18:47.380 --> 01:18:50.540]  That's how he wrote his name at high times, RR.
[01:18:50.540 --> 01:18:52.180]  It didn't have Rosenbaum.
[01:18:52.180 --> 01:18:53.560]  It didn't have a first name.
[01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:54.980]  It was just RR.
[01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:57.260]  So forever, nobody knows who this man is.
[01:18:57.260 --> 01:18:59.020]  And the reason he puts RR
[01:18:59.020 --> 01:19:00.920]  is because at that time weed was illegal
[01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:03.220]  and he would have lost his job as a true author
[01:19:03.220 --> 01:19:06.940]  writing for other companies for writing for cannabis, right?
[01:19:06.940 --> 01:19:08.840]  Because people are jackass assholes.
[01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:10.020]  They believe what they believe
[01:19:10.060 --> 01:19:11.660]  and think you're a fuck if you don't believe it.
[01:19:11.660 --> 01:19:13.940]  So this man who believes cannabis is good
[01:19:13.940 --> 01:19:16.900]  and works for whatever reason is writing about it.
[01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:19.100]  And the people around him and his other jobs
[01:19:19.100 --> 01:19:22.180]  think that if you do that, something's wrong with you, right?
[01:19:22.180 --> 01:19:26.020]  So he doesn't put his real name down and it just puts RR.
[01:19:26.020 --> 01:19:27.740]  But like I said, if you dive in deep enough,
[01:19:27.740 --> 01:19:29.540]  you can find the information.
[01:19:29.540 --> 01:19:31.580]  I believe it's even on the Wikipedia page now.
[01:19:31.580 --> 01:19:33.200]  If you go to his Wikipedia page,
[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:37.020]  it's listed as one of his jobs, working for high times.
[01:19:37.020 --> 01:19:39.380]  But for years, he never told anybody
[01:19:39.740 --> 01:19:41.100]  that he was the actual dude.
[01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:42.660]  He's the guy that wrote that thing.
[01:19:42.660 --> 01:19:44.660]  I've got a whole bunch of shit in here from him.
[01:19:44.660 --> 01:19:47.140]  I've even got old write-ups from Sam
[01:19:47.140 --> 01:19:50.220]  when he went by the name, what is it?
[01:19:50.220 --> 01:19:52.860]  I know I'm gonna fuck it up when I try to say it.
[01:19:52.860 --> 01:19:53.980]  Selznitz.
[01:19:53.980 --> 01:19:54.940]  Selznitz, yeah.
[01:19:54.940 --> 01:19:55.900]  Or Jingles.
[01:19:55.900 --> 01:19:57.220]  Jingles Backwards.
[01:19:57.220 --> 01:19:58.580]  Yeah. Jingles Backwards.
[01:19:58.580 --> 01:19:59.420]  Yeah.
[01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:02.300]  And he did that in a couple of different magazines.
[01:20:04.060 --> 01:20:06.740]  Yeah, all of this reading stuff is very important.
[01:20:06.740 --> 01:20:09.460]  Like you were saying earlier about the reading.
[01:20:09.460 --> 01:20:10.820]  And also going back-
[01:20:10.820 --> 01:20:11.900]  Mad Jag.
[01:20:11.900 --> 01:20:14.540]  That's the guy that bought the seeds
[01:20:14.540 --> 01:20:18.140]  from Sam and Robert Connell Clark in 79.
[01:20:19.020 --> 01:20:21.220]  And then he kept trying to buy them again when they ran out
[01:20:21.220 --> 01:20:22.100]  and they didn't have no more.
[01:20:22.100 --> 01:20:24.020]  In 81, they couldn't find them again to get it.
[01:20:24.020 --> 01:20:25.860]  And then by 84, Sam gets busted.
[01:20:25.860 --> 01:20:28.020]  Sam and Rob both get busted.
[01:20:28.020 --> 01:20:32.300]  And that's the first time I believe skunk changes again.
[01:20:32.300 --> 01:20:34.860]  After the number two's gone,
[01:20:34.860 --> 01:20:36.180]  you only end up with skunk one
[01:20:36.620 --> 01:20:37.980]  and it becomes a whole different plant
[01:20:37.980 --> 01:20:39.620]  after they get busted, right?
[01:20:39.620 --> 01:20:41.660]  And that's because they don't have the original parents.
[01:20:41.660 --> 01:20:42.980]  They've only got the seed stock
[01:20:42.980 --> 01:20:45.460]  from what was made from sacred seeds.
[01:20:45.460 --> 01:20:47.300]  And then you end up with a whole new plant
[01:20:47.300 --> 01:20:50.220]  that's being sold to skunk that does not carry the terpenes.
[01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:52.820]  And if you read into this, they tell you
[01:20:52.820 --> 01:20:54.780]  the terpene profile was rare to show up
[01:20:54.780 --> 01:20:57.660]  with that extremely rotten skunk smell.
[01:20:57.660 --> 01:20:59.220]  It was there in a lot of them,
[01:20:59.220 --> 01:21:01.100]  but the one that just devastated you
[01:21:01.100 --> 01:21:03.580]  was only about 25% of the seeds they grew.
[01:21:03.580 --> 01:21:05.100]  And they grew 3,000.
[01:21:05.100 --> 01:21:08.460]  So a dude with 10 packs of seed, one tip pack,
[01:21:08.460 --> 01:21:11.900]  the chance that you found the gnarliest roadkill skunk
[01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:14.620]  in the year 2016, you're tripping.
[01:21:14.620 --> 01:21:15.780]  It's not there.
[01:21:15.780 --> 01:21:17.740]  You don't have what was originally there
[01:21:17.740 --> 01:21:20.260]  because both the parents that made the first ones
[01:21:20.260 --> 01:21:22.480]  have been gone since 84.
[01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:25.300]  So there's no way for someone to have that afterwards.
[01:21:25.300 --> 01:21:27.460]  You just have a genetic version of it
[01:21:27.460 --> 01:21:30.780]  because you're diving into F2s and F3s and F4s.
[01:21:30.780 --> 01:21:34.100]  None of them are the original F1s
[01:21:34.100 --> 01:21:36.620]  that made the very first shit in 76.
[01:21:36.620 --> 01:21:37.880]  None of them, they're gone.
[01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:39.780]  The seed stock is absolutely gone.
[01:21:43.500 --> 01:21:44.980]  Well, yeah, but that's what everyone's
[01:21:44.980 --> 01:21:46.300]  trying to remember, right?
[01:21:46.300 --> 01:21:47.880]  Everyone keeps saying that they're looking
[01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:50.040]  for roadkill skunk or they're looking for skunk.
[01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:51.580]  The original one is gone.
[01:21:51.580 --> 01:21:53.340]  So if you're looking for skunk from 2000,
[01:21:53.340 --> 01:21:54.520]  well, let's say that.
[01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:55.780]  It's a whole different ballgame.
[01:21:55.780 --> 01:22:00.780]  Just like Hayes from 69 is a whole different Hayes from 99,
[01:22:00.900 --> 01:22:03.420]  even though they're both marketed as Hayes, right?
[01:22:03.420 --> 01:22:06.740]  My Hayes is completely different than a lot of Hayes
[01:22:06.740 --> 01:22:08.700]  that are being sold out there to people right now.
[01:22:08.700 --> 01:22:10.420]  But there are other people with a Hayes
[01:22:10.420 --> 01:22:14.200]  that's very similar to mine from Positronic to Tom Hill,
[01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:17.200]  to Tom McCormick, to Flying Dutchman.
[01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:20.120]  There's a lot of people that will pass you a real Hayes
[01:22:20.120 --> 01:22:22.780]  and you guys are all buying polyhybrids, calling them Hayes
[01:22:22.780 --> 01:22:24.500]  and you're fucking up the whole program.
[01:22:24.500 --> 01:22:26.860]  It bastardizes both lines
[01:22:26.860 --> 01:22:29.180]  when you call a complete polyhybrid
[01:22:29.180 --> 01:22:32.540]  the same name as the original plant that made it.
[01:22:32.700 --> 01:22:36.020]  That's like calling an S1 of a Kim dog,
[01:22:36.020 --> 01:22:38.100]  Kim dog also and passing that clone to everyone.
[01:22:38.100 --> 01:22:41.140]  And now you've got a version of Kim dog being passed around
[01:22:41.140 --> 01:22:42.740]  that fucks up everything.
[01:22:42.740 --> 01:22:43.580]  Yeah.
[01:22:43.580 --> 01:22:45.920]  Like people gotta be harder about this shit.
[01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:47.140]  There's not many people out there
[01:22:47.140 --> 01:22:50.100]  that are claiming to have original Hayes like you either.
[01:22:50.100 --> 01:22:50.940]  You know?
[01:22:50.940 --> 01:22:52.740]  And like I said, I had it since 2011.
[01:22:52.740 --> 01:22:54.800]  And when do I drop the seeds for Hayes for days?
[01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:57.180]  In 10 years later, almost.
[01:22:57.180 --> 01:23:00.820]  It was nine years later that I dropped a original Hayes F4.
[01:23:00.860 --> 01:23:04.460]  I took 10 years of outcrossing it to my other plants
[01:23:04.460 --> 01:23:07.700]  and then growing it in my garden and showing everybody else.
[01:23:07.700 --> 01:23:10.660]  So everyone that knew about Hayes that grew Hayes before
[01:23:10.660 --> 01:23:13.280]  will hit me up and go, where the fuck did you get that?
[01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:15.620]  I haven't seen that since the fucking seventies, right?
[01:23:15.620 --> 01:23:17.180]  Or since 81 or something like that.
[01:23:17.180 --> 01:23:20.420]  I had so many people hit me up going, what the fuck?
[01:23:20.420 --> 01:23:21.580]  How did, where did you find it?
[01:23:21.580 --> 01:23:22.460]  How do I get it?
[01:23:22.460 --> 01:23:25.340]  And then I'm like, well, you know, shit shows up.
[01:23:25.340 --> 01:23:27.820]  And I've got Hayes seeds that go back to 96.
[01:23:27.820 --> 01:23:29.640]  I just can't get them to pop no more.
[01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:33.280]  Those fuckers turn the most purple purple you've ever seen.
[01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:36.280]  They're so hard to that magenta side.
[01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:37.760]  It's crazy.
[01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:40.320]  But that plant grows at such a rapid pace.
[01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:41.380]  I used to give it to people here
[01:23:41.380 --> 01:23:42.960]  that wanted to grow indoor purple.
[01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:44.080]  They'd say, I just need purple.
[01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:45.520]  So I'd give them the Hayes.
[01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:47.320]  It was called Simperphi.
[01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:48.760]  I named it for my uncle.
[01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:51.380]  It's the first strain I ever created.
[01:23:51.380 --> 01:23:53.620]  It was a pure Hayes, crossed to a pure Hayes.
[01:23:53.620 --> 01:23:56.320]  And I ended up with two phenotypes that come out of it.
[01:23:56.320 --> 01:23:58.920]  One's green phenol and the other one's a purple phenol.
[01:23:58.920 --> 01:24:00.360]  Half of them are purple.
[01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:02.920]  That plant grows, like if you look in the chat right now,
[01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:05.160]  Don Irie's D, the purple there, that's
[01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:07.040]  the color of that purple plant grew.
[01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:09.680]  And it just, it would outtake your whole room.
[01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:11.760]  If you don't flip it at like two feet,
[01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:13.840]  it's going to get 12 feet tall and be taller
[01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:16.080]  than your whole damn ceiling.
[01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:18.200]  It's going to grow over the top of your lights.
[01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:20.040]  It's going to be fucked up because you don't
[01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:21.120]  know how to grow the plant.
[01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:22.860]  And it teaches these dudes that have
[01:24:22.860 --> 01:24:26.280]  been growing all these polyhybrid wide leaf short
[01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:28.920]  plants for so long that they really
[01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:30.160]  don't know how to grow plants.
[01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:31.580]  They just know how to grow the one
[01:24:31.580 --> 01:24:34.320]  that they've had in their garden for so long.
[01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:37.160]  And I've seen that so many times.
[01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:41.400]  Do you see that Don Irie question?
[01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:43.800]  Do you know that's the original?
[01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:45.640]  Because I've been growing it and smoking it.
[01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:48.480]  I started smoking weed in 1977, man.
[01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:50.080]  Well, technically what they're saying
[01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:53.120]  is true because it's Colombian and Mexican and Indian.
[01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:53.840]  I said that.
[01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:55.840]  It is a polyhybrid.
[01:24:55.880 --> 01:24:57.800]  But haze comes from Colombia.
[01:24:57.800 --> 01:24:59.040]  It is a polyhybrid.
[01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:01.040]  And that's what I heard from a lot of the old guys
[01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:02.160]  that I smoked the haze with.
[01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:04.160]  They said this just reminds me of the Colombian
[01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:05.640]  that I had back in the 70s and 80s.
[01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:06.560]  That's what it is.
[01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:09.480]  Haze is Colombian, but it's a three-way Colombian
[01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:11.600]  that made pure haze.
[01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:16.120]  Original haze comes to America in a form of the exact same.
[01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:18.520]  And it's called original haze when it's pure haze,
[01:25:18.520 --> 01:25:19.800]  the three-way Colombian.
[01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:22.600]  It's also called original haze when it's got the Corella
[01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:23.800]  tie added to it.
[01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:26.120]  It's still been called original haze.
[01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:28.080]  I have the screenshots of that, too.
[01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:29.800]  If I dig them up, I can send them.
[01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:32.400]  And then there's also one with the Afghani added to it.
[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:35.800]  So there's Afghani, Corella tie, and the three-way Colombian.
[01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:38.240]  That's also called original haze.
[01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:39.480]  That's what I'm talking about.
[01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:41.920]  People have to do the dive in and find out
[01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:42.960]  what they're growing.
[01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:46.040]  And the fact that I've grown haze for so long, I know.
[01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:49.040]  And I can show you my pictures compared to,
[01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:51.840]  like Todd just dropped some pictures of his original haze
[01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:55.840]  that show the leaf serrations and the shape of the leaf.
[01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:58.960]  His picture looks almost identical to mine.
[01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:02.240]  So how do two guys have a picture of the same serrations
[01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:04.600]  on a leaf, the same structure of the plant,
[01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:08.440]  the same flower time, and we're both lying
[01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:09.480]  and we don't know each other?
[01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:10.320]  Like personally?
[01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:12.000]  And you haven't shared cuts.
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.440]  Yeah, I'm not sharing cuts.
[01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:15.160]  But I have sent cuts of my haze out
[01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:17.480]  to dudes that were 45 or older.
[01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:19.840]  I've sent it out to dudes that were almost 60.
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:21.920]  And them dudes are all like, holy shit, bro.
[01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:24.000]  This brings me back to being a teenager.
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.600]  Right, that doesn't happen when they smoke cookies.
[01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:28.920]  It doesn't happen when they smoke Afghani-1
[01:26:28.920 --> 01:26:30.480]  in seed form today.
[01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:33.160]  It doesn't happen when they smoke Skunk-1.
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:35.280]  It doesn't happen when they smoke cookies.
[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:38.200]  Like these dudes smoke my haze or even that old Congo
[01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:40.800]  because I sent the Congo and the haze to a couple guys.
[01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:42.560]  And they both are like, what the fuck, dude?
[01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:45.800]  Like nothing gets me high like this kind of shit, right?
[01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:48.480]  But you got to grow them for 12 to 14 weeks.
[01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:51.600]  So indoors, you get two grows a year.
[01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:53.160]  And if you fuck one of them up, you're
[01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:55.680]  fucked, like you lost all your herb, right?
[01:26:55.680 --> 01:26:57.440]  And now you got one grow that year
[01:26:57.440 --> 01:26:58.840]  because you're growing this.
[01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:01.400]  You can't do a staggered grow with a haze
[01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:02.760]  because of how it grows.
[01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:05.080]  When they're small, they're not going to receive enough light
[01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:07.400]  when the bigs one are towering over the top of them.
[01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:09.600]  So you have to run a whole room of haze
[01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:12.600]  and realize if you don't know how to train a plant fast,
[01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:14.920]  it's going to outpace everything in your fucking room.
[01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:17.920]  If you start pumping too much nitrogen in there,
[01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:19.760]  you might fuck some shit up because she
[01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:22.920]  doesn't need massive amount of nitrogen at specific times.
[01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:24.480]  If there's too much blue in the room,
[01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:26.720]  she's not going to flower for you correctly.
[01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:28.800]  That's what I teach you how to grow something
[01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:32.080]  besides green crack and granddaddy purple, right?
[01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:32.580]  Yeah.
[01:27:32.580 --> 01:27:33.920]  For real.
[01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:36.160]  So which version of the haze do you
[01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:38.920]  think Sam took over to Holland?
[01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:40.960]  Because that would be the source of what I have.
[01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:46.120]  I believe he took the Karela-Thai-Afghani cross
[01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:47.280]  over there, I believe.
[01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:50.480]  And possibly one that had a skunk in it.
[01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:52.160]  It ain't pure haze over there.
[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:54.120]  It's just not pure haze.
[01:27:54.120 --> 01:27:57.160]  The way they grow and finish, they're not pure.
[01:27:57.160 --> 01:28:00.320]  The way the terpenes come out of them, they're not pure hazes.
[01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:03.080]  They just, they're carrying other profiles
[01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:05.840]  that an older haze does not carry.
[01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:08.760]  And they're not giving you the expressions
[01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:09.680]  that they're supposed.
[01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:13.120]  There's no purples coming out of them from the magenta side.
[01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:16.280]  You're not seeing the silvers and the blues plants coming out
[01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:16.840]  of them.
[01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:19.720]  You're only seeing the hybrid mother that
[01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:21.440]  starts coming out of those lines.
[01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:23.280]  Like when you cross it to something else,
[01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:25.600]  that other plant shows up way too often.
[01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:27.200]  If it was more haze, that haze is
[01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:29.920]  going to dominate almost everything that shows out
[01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:32.160]  of that plant except for some colors.
[01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:34.520]  And like the density of the bud, the first thing
[01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:37.480]  that haze does is give its structure
[01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:38.480]  over to that other plant.
[01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:40.480]  It gets bigger than shit, taller than hell.
[01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:42.020]  So you could have a small plant, you
[01:28:42.020 --> 01:28:43.560]  breed it to the original haze.
[01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:46.240]  It gets much, much bigger.
[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:48.640]  That blood structure will start to open up.
[01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:52.720]  So now that you have a better plant for trichome production
[01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:54.160]  because more sun's hitting it, it
[01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:56.640]  has the ability to actually produce more trichomes.
[01:28:56.640 --> 01:28:58.120]  We've all broken up a dense bud.
[01:28:58.120 --> 01:28:59.760]  And inside that bud, there was nothing
[01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:03.520]  but immature, small, fucking handed trichomes.
[01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:05.000]  But on the outside of that bud, it's
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:08.480]  covered in swollen glands that are ripe.
[01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:09.680]  Just they're ready to go.
[01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:14.160]  If you open your bud up, like on a haze, that's what happens.
[01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:17.600]  They've evolved for the sun to travel over the top of them.
[01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:20.240]  So they have to have a very stretched out structure
[01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:22.360]  so that the sun can hit every part of that plant.
[01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:24.800]  That's why the leaves are serrated and skinny.
[01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:26.240]  The sun's coming straight down.
[01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:29.520]  On an Afghani or these broadleaf plants,
[01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:33.120]  the sun spins more around them than over the top.
[01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:37.000]  So they can have a wider leaf to absorb and to shade
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:38.540]  because of the way the sun's coming.
[01:29:38.540 --> 01:29:41.760]  It's got more UV that's coming in from different angles
[01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:42.640]  in the wintertime.
[01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:44.480]  That shit will destroy you, man.
[01:29:44.480 --> 01:29:46.280]  Does the same thing with a plant.
[01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:48.520]  All right, we got a million questions.
[01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:51.880]  So let me just, because some of them are way back in the chat.
[01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:55.000]  Why do people say that there's tie with some of the haze
[01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:56.080]  that you're talking about?
[01:29:56.080 --> 01:29:58.280]  It's originating in Colombia.
[01:29:58.280 --> 01:30:02.600]  I just said that when it was brought here as the pure haze,
[01:30:02.600 --> 01:30:05.280]  it was crossed by multiple people.
[01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:10.400]  Mine comes from two people named RL and G in San Diego.
[01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:14.920]  In 76, they crossed the Corella Thai India plant.
[01:30:14.920 --> 01:30:17.360]  So it's a Thai and Indian.
[01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:20.840]  They use an Indian male and a Corella Thai female,
[01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:23.280]  or Corella India and a Thai.
[01:30:23.280 --> 01:30:24.520]  So the Thai stick female,
[01:30:24.520 --> 01:30:27.240]  that's the plant they were using to make Thai sticks with.
[01:30:27.240 --> 01:30:28.720]  It's not a specific phenotype.
[01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:32.440]  It's just herb from Thailand crossed to an Indian male.
[01:30:32.440 --> 01:30:34.400]  That's been known as a,
[01:30:34.400 --> 01:30:37.920]  if you search online of famous males
[01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:39.080]  that were used back in the day,
[01:30:39.080 --> 01:30:42.000]  the Corella Indian was a very famous line that was used.
[01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:46.160]  That crossed to the Thai was then crossed to the Colombian.
[01:30:50.840 --> 01:30:51.680]  First, there's-
[01:30:51.680 --> 01:30:53.520]  Whoa.
[01:30:53.520 --> 01:30:54.680]  Yeah.
[01:30:54.680 --> 01:30:56.560]  Well, yep.
[01:31:00.610 --> 01:31:03.370]  All right, that man is a wealth of knowledge, isn't he?
[01:31:04.810 --> 01:31:06.530]  And he's back.
[01:31:06.530 --> 01:31:07.370]  He's back.
[01:31:07.370 --> 01:31:08.210]  Okay. All right.
[01:31:08.210 --> 01:31:10.290]  So you can take that three way Colombian
[01:31:10.290 --> 01:31:13.050]  and cross it to the Corella Thai in 76.
[01:31:13.090 --> 01:31:15.810]  And then they make a poster that I've shown everybody
[01:31:15.810 --> 01:31:18.370]  that breaks down the original haze.
[01:31:18.370 --> 01:31:19.210]  It was supposed to be
[01:31:19.210 --> 01:31:22.930]  the very first commercial cannabis strain available.
[01:31:22.930 --> 01:31:25.410]  They made a poster that broke it all down.
[01:31:25.410 --> 01:31:26.930]  It told you the different phenotypes
[01:31:26.930 --> 01:31:29.090]  that you should find coming out of it.
[01:31:29.090 --> 01:31:32.290]  It was made in 1976, I believe it was.
[01:31:33.170 --> 01:31:35.250]  I've shown it, a few other people shown it.
[01:31:35.250 --> 01:31:37.650]  Not So Dog shown it, Riot shown it.
[01:31:37.650 --> 01:31:39.770]  There's a lot of people that have shown it.
[01:31:39.770 --> 01:31:41.850]  Yeah, I saw it on a forum a long time ago,
[01:31:41.850 --> 01:31:43.410]  and then it was taken down eventually.
[01:31:43.410 --> 01:31:44.250]  It's like the-
[01:31:44.250 --> 01:31:45.090]  Yeah, it's on my Instagram.
[01:31:45.090 --> 01:31:46.530]  You know how pictures go on there sometimes.
[01:31:46.530 --> 01:31:47.370]  All right.
[01:31:47.370 --> 01:31:48.210]  It's on my Instagram.
[01:31:48.210 --> 01:31:51.850]  I passed the story to, on Facebook.
[01:31:51.850 --> 01:31:55.650]  Big Herbs wrote about haze in his autobiography.
[01:31:55.650 --> 01:31:57.250]  If you go on the old forums,
[01:31:57.250 --> 01:32:00.290]  he's one of the main dudes that's asking Sam
[01:32:00.290 --> 01:32:01.770]  and all the other guys.
[01:32:01.770 --> 01:32:03.090]  Yeah, he's one of the guys
[01:32:03.090 --> 01:32:05.170]  that's really diving into the hazes
[01:32:05.170 --> 01:32:06.890]  and asking people the real questions.
[01:32:06.890 --> 01:32:08.370]  Like, how come you're telling me
[01:32:08.370 --> 01:32:10.210]  you're getting sweet bubblegum shit out of haze
[01:32:10.210 --> 01:32:12.930]  when all the hazes at a specific time period
[01:32:12.930 --> 01:32:16.890]  were cat piss and incense and leathery, earthy shit?
[01:32:16.890 --> 01:32:18.450]  There's no bubblegum in a haze.
[01:32:18.450 --> 01:32:19.530]  That's why I brought up earlier,
[01:32:19.530 --> 01:32:20.810]  there's no sweetness in no haze.
[01:32:20.810 --> 01:32:22.850]  If you're getting sweetness in your haze,
[01:32:22.850 --> 01:32:24.890]  you just got packed up with some seeds
[01:32:24.890 --> 01:32:27.130]  that have haze written on the fucking front of it.
[01:32:27.130 --> 01:32:28.450]  It's not a haze.
[01:32:28.450 --> 01:32:30.610]  It's not gonna breed for the haze.
[01:32:30.610 --> 01:32:32.130]  It's not gonna taste like haze.
[01:32:32.130 --> 01:32:33.930]  It's not gonna finish like a haze.
[01:32:33.930 --> 01:32:35.410]  It just has the name on it.
[01:32:35.410 --> 01:32:36.250]  And that's all right,
[01:32:36.250 --> 01:32:38.970]  but it's bastardizing what's happening here.
[01:32:38.970 --> 01:32:41.930]  So if someone really uses haze for a medicinal purpose
[01:32:41.930 --> 01:32:43.450]  or even to get really high, right,
[01:32:43.450 --> 01:32:45.930]  to get that mental, that focus going
[01:32:45.930 --> 01:32:49.850]  and to, you know, some hazes have a psychedelic effect
[01:32:49.850 --> 01:32:52.090]  to where your mind wanders so hard,
[01:32:52.090 --> 01:32:53.850]  it's almost like day tripping, man.
[01:32:54.970 --> 01:32:56.250]  Like, if you're looking for that
[01:32:56.250 --> 01:32:58.090]  and you cross that shit to a bubble
[01:32:58.090 --> 01:33:00.530]  and then cross it to cookies, it's something else,
[01:33:00.530 --> 01:33:01.970]  you ain't getting that high.
[01:33:01.970 --> 01:33:03.810]  But you wrote haze all over the pack
[01:33:03.810 --> 01:33:05.850]  and now everybody's buying it because haze was hot.
[01:33:05.850 --> 01:33:07.650]  That's what happened when Neville passed away.
[01:33:07.650 --> 01:33:09.890]  Everybody starts dropping shit with haze in the name
[01:33:09.890 --> 01:33:12.890]  so people will buy it and none of them were hazes, right?
[01:33:12.890 --> 01:33:15.210]  They're not even dropping Neville's haze, right?
[01:33:15.210 --> 01:33:17.610]  They're just dropping something across the Neville's haze
[01:33:17.610 --> 01:33:18.690]  then recross to it.
[01:33:18.690 --> 01:33:21.810]  And then I took my time and I'd been working with a line.
[01:33:21.810 --> 01:33:23.290]  I'm like, might as well put out a real haze
[01:33:23.290 --> 01:33:25.410]  because these people are buying bullshit.
[01:33:26.490 --> 01:33:28.970]  If you really want a haze, you buy a haze to breed with it.
[01:33:28.970 --> 01:33:31.630]  You don't buy a haze just to specifically grow it to flower
[01:33:31.630 --> 01:33:33.690]  because it's gonna be hard shit to do.
[01:33:33.690 --> 01:33:35.290]  If you don't have the outdoor space to do it,
[01:33:35.290 --> 01:33:36.450]  you're not gonna grow it properly.
[01:33:36.450 --> 01:33:39.850]  It needs UV light to produce all the trichomes
[01:33:39.850 --> 01:33:42.370]  and all the cannabinoids that you are actually after
[01:33:42.370 --> 01:33:44.650]  to get that high, you need real sunlight.
[01:33:44.650 --> 01:33:47.650]  That's why I showed myself growing it for two years outside
[01:33:47.650 --> 01:33:50.930]  both times reaching 18 to 25 feet
[01:33:50.930 --> 01:33:54.250]  and 65 gallon pots, right?
[01:33:54.250 --> 01:33:57.130]  Growing taller than fucking pine trees next to it.
[01:33:57.130 --> 01:33:59.290]  And you guys are all out there going, holy shit.
[01:33:59.290 --> 01:34:00.890]  That's what the fuck is that?
[01:34:00.890 --> 01:34:02.490]  And it's a haze.
[01:34:02.490 --> 01:34:04.090]  It's what real haze grows like.
[01:34:04.090 --> 01:34:06.150]  And then people ask me what mine looks like.
[01:34:06.850 --> 01:34:09.030]  I get a lot of tie influence from the high
[01:34:09.030 --> 01:34:11.150]  but she grows like the Colombian haze.
[01:34:11.150 --> 01:34:13.950]  She's a tall, stretchy, long flowering plant.
[01:34:13.950 --> 01:34:15.910]  But I can get a lot of that.
[01:34:15.910 --> 01:34:19.070]  Like for me, the high for me leans towards the tie.
[01:34:19.070 --> 01:34:21.630]  That's what I feel when I'm smoking it.
[01:34:21.630 --> 01:34:23.870]  Someone else might feel something different
[01:34:23.870 --> 01:34:25.830]  because that's all our chemical makeup.
[01:34:27.150 --> 01:34:30.990]  Only experience that I have with tie or supposed tie
[01:34:30.990 --> 01:34:35.990]  was another thing that I got from Sam through Gypsy.
[01:34:36.150 --> 01:34:40.470]  It was his original haze tie skunk one cross.
[01:34:40.470 --> 01:34:42.470]  And there was some stuff that came out
[01:34:42.470 --> 01:34:45.550]  that like matched some tie descriptions and everything.
[01:34:45.550 --> 01:34:49.950]  But I, and it smelled like my uncle's corner of his basement
[01:34:49.950 --> 01:34:52.150]  where he made some tie.
[01:34:52.150 --> 01:34:54.130]  That's why it tastes like cedar,
[01:34:54.130 --> 01:34:57.050]  like the bottom of a hamster cage that got wet.
[01:34:57.050 --> 01:34:59.510]  That's that fucking, that funky basement,
[01:34:59.510 --> 01:35:03.630]  fucking weird, fucking old musty sock shit
[01:35:03.630 --> 01:35:04.950]  kind of type of thing.
[01:35:04.950 --> 01:35:06.510]  That's what I get.
[01:35:06.510 --> 01:35:07.350]  Yeah.
[01:35:07.350 --> 01:35:10.150]  That's a very good description of what I was smelling in it.
[01:35:10.150 --> 01:35:13.350]  And then there was also this juicy fruit,
[01:35:13.350 --> 01:35:14.990]  like juicy fruit gum.
[01:35:14.990 --> 01:35:16.690]  There is a juicy fruit tie in there,
[01:35:16.690 --> 01:35:19.310]  but like that's, I don't get that profile.
[01:35:19.310 --> 01:35:20.990]  I only get the highs, what I'm talking about.
[01:35:20.990 --> 01:35:23.670]  I never get any juicy fruit type flavors
[01:35:23.670 --> 01:35:25.110]  that come out of that thing because the Colombian.
[01:35:25.110 --> 01:35:26.870]  Well, this was like a smell mostly,
[01:35:26.870 --> 01:35:29.870]  it's just a little bit of the flavor, but it was mostly smell
[01:35:29.870 --> 01:35:32.550]  and then it just, it kind of just tasted like weed.
[01:35:32.550 --> 01:35:34.670]  It didn't have like anything distinct about it,
[01:35:35.390 --> 01:35:36.790]  but it smelled like you open up
[01:35:36.790 --> 01:35:38.650]  with yellow packet juicy fruit
[01:35:38.650 --> 01:35:39.750]  and that's what it smelled like.
[01:35:39.750 --> 01:35:43.790]  And it was kind of intriguing, but yeah.
[01:35:43.790 --> 01:35:45.070]  And it was jungle weed.
[01:35:45.070 --> 01:35:45.910]  That was another thing.
[01:35:45.910 --> 01:35:47.270]  It was really thin leaves
[01:35:47.270 --> 01:35:50.630]  and it was just leaf leaf everywhere, real branchy.
[01:35:50.630 --> 01:35:53.430]  And, but it had strong branches.
[01:35:53.430 --> 01:35:55.390]  Like, yeah, that's how it is.
[01:35:55.390 --> 01:35:57.050]  Hang all of that leaf.
[01:35:57.050 --> 01:35:59.510]  I've had my haze out in 70 mile an hour winds
[01:35:59.510 --> 01:36:02.350]  and it doesn't lose a branch at all.
[01:36:02.350 --> 01:36:03.510]  I've done that for two years.
[01:36:03.510 --> 01:36:06.310]  That thing will bend over 45 degrees in the wind.
[01:36:08.230 --> 01:36:09.870]  It looks like one of those funny dudes
[01:36:09.870 --> 01:36:12.190]  in front of a fucking, like a car dealership
[01:36:12.190 --> 01:36:13.430]  that's doing this.
[01:36:13.430 --> 01:36:16.030]  That's exactly what the haze does in the wind.
[01:36:16.030 --> 01:36:16.870]  Yeah.
[01:36:16.870 --> 01:36:19.070]  I posted pictures, videos of it.
[01:36:19.070 --> 01:36:20.470]  It will not break in the wind.
[01:36:20.470 --> 01:36:25.470]  That plant is highly, highly evolved to handle wind.
[01:36:25.550 --> 01:36:26.390]  For real.
[01:36:26.390 --> 01:36:28.130]  You wouldn't think it'll lose leaf,
[01:36:28.130 --> 01:36:32.550]  but it's not breaking branches at all.
[01:36:32.550 --> 01:36:34.510]  So when you're gonna make some more of those, man,
[01:36:34.510 --> 01:36:37.110]  when you're gonna put some more of those out for people?
[01:36:37.110 --> 01:36:38.430]  I put them out all the time.
[01:36:38.430 --> 01:36:40.590]  I made like 50,000 seeds.
[01:36:40.590 --> 01:36:41.990]  So I have them all the time.
[01:36:43.790 --> 01:36:45.190]  That's what I was gonna tell Peter today.
[01:36:45.190 --> 01:36:47.590]  If we wanted, I could do a 420 on my haze
[01:36:47.590 --> 01:36:49.390]  for days a deal today.
[01:36:49.390 --> 01:36:51.430]  I forgot to send him an email.
[01:36:51.430 --> 01:36:53.150]  You guys hit me up here and I was-
[01:36:53.150 --> 01:36:53.990]  What do you wanna do?
[01:36:53.990 --> 01:36:56.790]  You wanna do like half price or?
[01:36:56.790 --> 01:36:58.230]  Yeah, I'm gonna do-
[01:36:58.230 --> 01:37:03.230]  I feel like your stuff is so fairly and reasonably priced.
[01:37:03.630 --> 01:37:08.630]  And I almost would rather support you than like-
[01:37:09.150 --> 01:37:09.990]  I don't know.
[01:37:09.990 --> 01:37:11.710]  We could do something, man.
[01:37:11.710 --> 01:37:13.390]  I was trying to figure something out.
[01:37:13.390 --> 01:37:16.630]  How about I throw in an extra something
[01:37:16.630 --> 01:37:19.830]  when people order something from you?
[01:37:19.830 --> 01:37:23.310]  If you'd like, either that or I can double the pack.
[01:37:23.310 --> 01:37:27.050]  I can double the pack for the orders today.
[01:37:28.270 --> 01:37:29.110]  We can put in some orders there
[01:37:29.110 --> 01:37:30.710]  and can double the haze packs.
[01:37:31.990 --> 01:37:33.470]  Like a twofer?
[01:37:33.470 --> 01:37:35.030]  Yeah, I give you 30.
[01:37:35.030 --> 01:37:36.750]  I'll put 30 seeds in the packs
[01:37:36.750 --> 01:37:38.270]  for everyone that orders today.
[01:37:38.270 --> 01:37:39.590]  And if you take orders today
[01:37:39.590 --> 01:37:41.230]  and I'll double those packs today.
[01:37:41.230 --> 01:37:42.790]  And I'll send them to you.
[01:37:42.790 --> 01:37:44.710]  So don't give out the ones you have.
[01:37:44.710 --> 01:37:45.990]  Take the orders, let me know
[01:37:45.990 --> 01:37:48.190]  and I'll send you how many packs you need.
[01:37:48.190 --> 01:37:49.110]  All right.
[01:37:49.110 --> 01:37:54.110]  So everyone who's watching and who can remember that,
[01:37:55.110 --> 01:37:58.310]  I will not ship them today if they're ordered today.
[01:37:58.310 --> 01:37:59.670]  Yeah, they won't go out today.
[01:37:59.670 --> 01:38:01.670]  And that's on the Haze for Days, right?
[01:38:01.670 --> 01:38:03.110]  Haze for Days.
[01:38:04.990 --> 01:38:06.590]  Dog.love.
[01:38:06.590 --> 01:38:07.590]  All right.
[01:38:07.590 --> 01:38:12.470]  So let me just catch up on the comments.
[01:38:12.470 --> 01:38:14.630]  So this was questions and comments.
[01:38:14.630 --> 01:38:16.110]  Greg McAllister,
[01:38:18.190 --> 01:38:21.470]  we do haze at 1212 from seed at day one.
[01:38:21.470 --> 01:38:22.630]  Good advice.
[01:38:22.750 --> 01:38:24.070]  Very good advice.
[01:38:24.070 --> 01:38:25.070]  He had a follow up comment.
[01:38:25.070 --> 01:38:26.590]  When I'm saying at 24,
[01:38:26.590 --> 01:38:28.630]  I'm talking about that's the maximum
[01:38:28.630 --> 01:38:30.070]  that plant needs to be from seed
[01:38:30.070 --> 01:38:31.310]  for you to flip it in a room
[01:38:31.310 --> 01:38:33.310]  that's got eight feet of clearance.
[01:38:33.310 --> 01:38:34.830]  Or you're gonna end up with a plant
[01:38:34.830 --> 01:38:36.750]  touching the light bulbs, period.
[01:38:36.750 --> 01:38:38.750]  That's what I'm talking about.
[01:38:38.750 --> 01:38:41.150]  So, but everybody I know buying them
[01:38:41.150 --> 01:38:44.470]  in the equatorial areas are running them 12 to 12
[01:38:44.470 --> 01:38:48.510]  down in Jamaica, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands.
[01:38:48.510 --> 01:38:52.070]  They're going straight 12 to 12 with my Haze for Days.
[01:38:52.510 --> 01:38:54.670]  So he says, Haze comes from a 1212 photo period.
[01:38:54.670 --> 01:38:56.310]  That would make sense if it's coming
[01:38:56.310 --> 01:38:58.670]  from kind of the Columbia area, right?
[01:38:58.670 --> 01:39:00.910]  Well, it does when it comes from nature,
[01:39:00.910 --> 01:39:04.790]  but since I'm not breeding them in a natural environment,
[01:39:04.790 --> 01:39:06.230]  since I'm not in Columbia,
[01:39:06.230 --> 01:39:09.670]  I can not, I'm not breeding my plants at 12 and 12
[01:39:09.670 --> 01:39:12.150]  because people are gonna buy these and wanna grow them.
[01:39:12.150 --> 01:39:13.710]  So I'm trying to steer them more
[01:39:13.710 --> 01:39:15.590]  towards the growers that are taking.
[01:39:15.590 --> 01:39:19.390]  I grow in a very hot area that's very arid.
[01:39:19.390 --> 01:39:21.750]  So I breed outdoors for my Haze.
[01:39:22.430 --> 01:39:23.750]  My Haze seeds were not bred inside.
[01:39:23.750 --> 01:39:27.670]  They were bred 100% outside in the natural sun
[01:39:27.670 --> 01:39:30.430]  in an area that's extremely hot,
[01:39:31.350 --> 01:39:33.870]  but also offers cold at the end of the season.
[01:39:33.870 --> 01:39:35.830]  So my plant handles frost very well.
[01:39:35.830 --> 01:39:38.110]  I've shown that taking them into December
[01:39:38.110 --> 01:39:39.270]  and them not molding.
[01:39:41.590 --> 01:39:42.950]  Haze gives her anxiety.
[01:39:42.950 --> 01:39:43.790]  Well, that's what Haze-
[01:39:43.790 --> 01:39:45.750]  It happens to a lot of people, man.
[01:39:45.750 --> 01:39:47.510]  Yeah, but also what Haze in America,
[01:39:47.510 --> 01:39:49.110]  like what year is he talking about?
[01:39:49.110 --> 01:39:50.070]  Stuff from the nineties?
[01:39:50.110 --> 01:39:51.110]  Because it's not Haze.
[01:39:51.110 --> 01:39:54.270]  It's mostly an NL5 or skunk cross.
[01:39:54.270 --> 01:39:56.630]  Well, yeah, most people are talking about Super Silver
[01:39:56.630 --> 01:39:57.590]  or Jack or something like that.
[01:39:57.590 --> 01:40:00.510]  Yeah, which aren't Hazes is what I mean.
[01:40:00.510 --> 01:40:03.470]  People believe these to be Hazes and they're not Hazes.
[01:40:03.470 --> 01:40:06.190]  So they're talking about polyhybrids that affect them.
[01:40:06.190 --> 01:40:08.230]  So a Super Silver Haze isn't going to affect you
[01:40:08.230 --> 01:40:09.590]  like amnesia Haze.
[01:40:09.590 --> 01:40:11.510]  So when you talk about them being Hazes
[01:40:11.510 --> 01:40:15.390]  and saying, Haze do this to me, it doesn't correlate.
[01:40:15.390 --> 01:40:18.110]  When you take the pure Hazes or original Hazes,
[01:40:18.150 --> 01:40:21.670]  you can correlate the highs and turpy profiles from those,
[01:40:21.670 --> 01:40:23.510]  but you're not gonna take the Super Silvers,
[01:40:23.510 --> 01:40:26.790]  the amnesias, the Americanas.
[01:40:26.790 --> 01:40:29.590]  Those Hazes are not the same Hazes.
[01:40:29.590 --> 01:40:31.350]  They don't affect you the same way.
[01:40:34.370 --> 01:40:36.730]  Yeah, Haze is gonna grow fucking through your roof.
[01:40:36.730 --> 01:40:39.050]  I'm a serious, I could show some videos.
[01:40:40.090 --> 01:40:42.930]  Multiple people that did not know how to grow Haze
[01:40:42.930 --> 01:40:45.570]  that I sent it to were trying to run that thing to four feet
[01:40:45.570 --> 01:40:48.130]  and then flip it like they were doing their other plants.
[01:40:48.130 --> 01:40:50.810]  My one partner, it took over a whole eight by eight tent
[01:40:50.810 --> 01:40:52.810]  when he did that and he had to just constantly top it
[01:40:52.810 --> 01:40:54.290]  and top it and top it.
[01:40:54.290 --> 01:40:55.650]  And I'm like, what are you doing, dude?
[01:40:55.650 --> 01:40:57.410]  All you're doing is causing stress to it,
[01:40:57.410 --> 01:41:00.410]  which is like when you top a plant and flower multiple times
[01:41:00.410 --> 01:41:04.210]  as it's flowering, you are shifting the amount of auxins
[01:41:04.210 --> 01:41:06.290]  from the top of the plant to a different part.
[01:41:06.290 --> 01:41:09.050]  And now you are causing a switch in the amount of ethylene
[01:41:09.050 --> 01:41:10.610]  that's being produced in those areas.
[01:41:10.610 --> 01:41:13.370]  And you're going to produce some morphidites in that plant.
[01:41:13.370 --> 01:41:15.690]  You are changing the endogenous hormones.
[01:41:15.690 --> 01:41:16.970]  Go ahead, I'm sorry.
[01:41:16.970 --> 01:41:19.450]  I have a question for you regarding that.
[01:41:19.450 --> 01:41:22.490]  I am trying super cropping for the first time.
[01:41:22.490 --> 01:41:24.290]  I've seen people have success with it.
[01:41:24.290 --> 01:41:26.130]  And I just chopped the tops off.
[01:41:26.130 --> 01:41:29.050]  And I'm worried about exactly what you're talking about.
[01:41:29.050 --> 01:41:31.090]  Is me cutting that top off of that plant
[01:41:31.090 --> 01:41:33.690]  and those hormones getting all fucked up.
[01:41:33.690 --> 01:41:35.290]  And I'm going to start seeing male flowers
[01:41:35.290 --> 01:41:36.130]  shooting out of these,
[01:41:36.130 --> 01:41:38.530]  what I'm trying to get to puff up on the bottom
[01:41:38.530 --> 01:41:40.570]  since I chopped and I dropped the lights.
[01:41:40.570 --> 01:41:43.210]  It can all be dependent on the time period you did it
[01:41:43.210 --> 01:41:46.130]  and the inputs that are being put in when you did it.
[01:41:46.130 --> 01:41:49.130]  So if you're topping right at a flower
[01:41:49.130 --> 01:41:51.370]  when you go 12 to 12 or just prior to it,
[01:41:51.370 --> 01:41:52.730]  like the week before,
[01:41:52.730 --> 01:41:55.490]  you're causing a major shift in the hormones of that plant
[01:41:55.490 --> 01:41:56.330]  as it's going into-
[01:41:56.330 --> 01:41:57.810]  Well this plant's done.
[01:41:57.810 --> 01:41:59.450]  Like it was done up top.
[01:42:00.370 --> 01:42:01.490]  Flowering?
[01:42:01.490 --> 01:42:03.010]  Yeah, it was done flowering up top.
[01:42:03.010 --> 01:42:04.490]  I was super cropping it.
[01:42:04.490 --> 01:42:05.330]  So you're-
[01:42:05.330 --> 01:42:07.370]  I cut the tops off of it and dropped the lights
[01:42:07.370 --> 01:42:09.650]  to get those lowers to puff up.
[01:42:09.650 --> 01:42:12.530]  No, I'm talking about super cropping at the switch.
[01:42:12.530 --> 01:42:14.530]  You're doing it, the plant's pretty much done now.
[01:42:15.050 --> 01:42:16.730]  You shouldn't have that issue really.
[01:42:16.730 --> 01:42:18.850]  You might see a late flower,
[01:42:18.850 --> 01:42:20.450]  stamina flower pop out of there.
[01:42:20.450 --> 01:42:23.890]  But what I'm talking about is doing that at transition
[01:42:23.890 --> 01:42:26.450]  and causing a complete hormone balance
[01:42:26.450 --> 01:42:27.690]  switch in the plant.
[01:42:27.690 --> 01:42:29.370]  And now getting homorphodites
[01:42:29.370 --> 01:42:31.610]  when you may seed the whole room.
[01:42:31.610 --> 01:42:32.570]  There's like, if you get it,
[01:42:32.570 --> 01:42:33.530]  when you cut the top off,
[01:42:33.530 --> 01:42:35.730]  the chances of you producing seeds in that room
[01:42:35.730 --> 01:42:37.670]  with that plant are very slim
[01:42:37.670 --> 01:42:39.010]  because of the amount of time left.
[01:42:39.010 --> 01:42:41.050]  So even if you do see a stamina flower
[01:42:41.050 --> 01:42:42.690]  at the end of the cycle,
[01:42:42.690 --> 01:42:43.850]  when you're topping,
[01:42:43.850 --> 01:42:48.850]  taking the tops off to harvest in different sections,
[01:42:49.090 --> 01:42:51.030]  it's not gonna pollinate itself.
[01:42:51.030 --> 01:42:53.610]  But if you do that in the switch of flower
[01:42:53.610 --> 01:42:54.650]  and start dumping,
[01:42:54.650 --> 01:42:56.690]  like say you had a nitrogen deficiency
[01:42:56.690 --> 01:42:58.970]  and you decided you're gonna throw in some top dressing,
[01:42:58.970 --> 01:42:59.970]  high in nitrogen,
[01:42:59.970 --> 01:43:02.170]  and you're gonna super crop at that time
[01:43:02.170 --> 01:43:03.590]  and start taking some of the top off.
[01:43:03.590 --> 01:43:05.530]  Now you've just completely switched
[01:43:05.530 --> 01:43:06.970]  how the hormones are gonna be produced
[01:43:06.970 --> 01:43:09.130]  in that plant at that period.
[01:43:09.130 --> 01:43:11.250]  Yeah, that makes perfect sense.
[01:43:11.250 --> 01:43:12.770]  So you should be training that.
[01:43:12.770 --> 01:43:13.810]  If you're gonna train a haze,
[01:43:13.810 --> 01:43:14.650]  like I said,
[01:43:14.650 --> 01:43:16.050]  if you're gonna do a screen of green with it,
[01:43:16.050 --> 01:43:17.330]  you need to start,
[01:43:17.330 --> 01:43:19.410]  as soon as that first set of branches pop out,
[01:43:19.410 --> 01:43:20.850]  you need to start tucking that sucker
[01:43:20.850 --> 01:43:22.270]  and getting it in there and weaving it.
[01:43:22.270 --> 01:43:23.450]  They're highly pliable.
[01:43:23.450 --> 01:43:24.650]  They're gonna bend.
[01:43:24.650 --> 01:43:26.210]  They're not gonna break off.
[01:43:26.210 --> 01:43:28.210]  But don't let it start shoot.
[01:43:28.210 --> 01:43:29.650]  If they start shooting up on you,
[01:43:29.650 --> 01:43:32.810]  they're gonna fucking stretch 400% easily.
[01:43:32.810 --> 01:43:34.690]  Three to 400% of my haze for days.
[01:43:34.690 --> 01:43:37.970]  That's why I say if you go over two feet in veg,
[01:43:37.970 --> 01:43:40.690]  that plant's gonna end up eight to 12 feet tall.
[01:43:41.050 --> 01:43:42.210]  That's why I always tell people,
[01:43:42.210 --> 01:43:44.650]  you have to flip that plant
[01:43:44.650 --> 01:43:46.890]  when it's canopy's at two feet.
[01:43:46.890 --> 01:43:48.230]  I don't care what size your pot is.
[01:43:48.230 --> 01:43:49.970]  If everything's two feet,
[01:43:49.970 --> 01:43:51.210]  it has to be flipped
[01:43:51.210 --> 01:43:53.270]  if you don't have the clearance on top.
[01:43:53.270 --> 01:43:56.250]  So if you need to have more vegetative space with it,
[01:43:56.250 --> 01:43:59.370]  you start weaving it into a screen,
[01:43:59.370 --> 01:44:00.610]  or you start staking it
[01:44:00.610 --> 01:44:03.290]  and bending it out horizontally instead of vertically.
[01:44:03.290 --> 01:44:04.610]  It grows completely different
[01:44:04.610 --> 01:44:06.330]  than if you're messing with a Bubba
[01:44:06.330 --> 01:44:09.770]  or a Granddaddy Purple or a Afghani No. 1.
[01:44:09.770 --> 01:44:10.610]  Those are all plants
[01:44:10.610 --> 01:44:13.590]  that you're trying to get as tall as possible
[01:44:13.590 --> 01:44:14.430]  before you flip them
[01:44:14.430 --> 01:44:15.670]  because they will not stretch.
[01:44:15.670 --> 01:44:17.890]  The haze is the polar opposite.
[01:44:17.890 --> 01:44:21.010]  It's gonna just outshade everything you put it next to.
[01:44:21.010 --> 01:44:24.830]  I've not seen any other line grow as rapidly
[01:44:24.830 --> 01:44:26.750]  and as quickly as that plant
[01:44:26.750 --> 01:44:28.710]  in any modern day cannabis, period.
[01:44:28.710 --> 01:44:30.130]  Nothing that's been bred in seed
[01:44:30.130 --> 01:44:31.970]  that's been passed to people out there
[01:44:31.970 --> 01:44:34.070]  really has the pace of that haze.
[01:44:35.590 --> 01:44:36.430]  One of the things
[01:44:36.430 --> 01:44:38.850]  that really made me start paying attention to you
[01:44:38.890 --> 01:44:41.370]  was that you like to talk about hormones a lot
[01:44:41.370 --> 01:44:46.370]  and people neglect to realize how important hormones are.
[01:44:47.050 --> 01:44:49.370]  Like earlier, you were talking about temperature
[01:44:49.370 --> 01:44:52.890]  and all of that and reading
[01:44:52.890 --> 01:44:54.290]  and people should read more.
[01:44:54.290 --> 01:44:59.290]  At the end of Marijuana Botany by Rob Clark,
[01:44:59.330 --> 01:45:00.910]  one of the appendices,
[01:45:01.970 --> 01:45:04.130]  it's either the first or second appendix,
[01:45:04.130 --> 01:45:08.450]  he talks about temperature and seedlings
[01:45:09.090 --> 01:45:09.930]  during germination
[01:45:09.930 --> 01:45:12.970]  and how you can steer them to be either male or female
[01:45:12.970 --> 01:45:16.450]  on which temperature that they're being popped at.
[01:45:16.450 --> 01:45:18.690]  And I played with that a little bit
[01:45:18.690 --> 01:45:22.610]  and it was about as consistent as they said that is,
[01:45:22.610 --> 01:45:24.050]  nothing's 100%.
[01:45:24.050 --> 01:45:25.410]  But it's not gonna be 100%.
[01:45:25.410 --> 01:45:27.250]  You can't because of the way that plant
[01:45:27.250 --> 01:45:30.130]  has evolutionary been steered through nature.
[01:45:30.130 --> 01:45:32.430]  Nature told it, you have to have hermaphrodites
[01:45:32.430 --> 01:45:34.950]  because one year you may not get any males.
[01:45:34.950 --> 01:45:36.370]  There may be so much stress in the air,
[01:45:36.370 --> 01:45:40.130]  the male because of temperature switched to become a female
[01:45:40.130 --> 01:45:41.850]  and it doesn't throw the stamina and flowers
[01:45:41.850 --> 01:45:42.670]  as opposed to.
[01:45:42.670 --> 01:45:43.510]  So now one of those females-
[01:45:43.510 --> 01:45:44.830]  Or all the males pop too early.
[01:45:44.830 --> 01:45:45.690]  Yeah, or they pop too.
[01:45:45.690 --> 01:45:46.890]  So something happened.
[01:45:50.550 --> 01:45:51.790]  I need to quit interrupting him.
[01:45:51.790 --> 01:45:53.090]  I'm the one fucking it up.
[01:45:53.090 --> 01:45:56.770]  Let the man speak.
[01:45:59.150 --> 01:46:00.150]  Can you hear me Peter?
[01:46:00.150 --> 01:46:01.630]  I can't hear you.
[01:46:01.630 --> 01:46:02.470]  Yeah, I was muted.
[01:46:02.470 --> 01:46:05.070]  So let's say we take cannabis
[01:46:05.070 --> 01:46:06.510]  from its natural environment
[01:46:06.510 --> 01:46:08.750]  that's been under a light that's got UV,
[01:46:08.750 --> 01:46:10.910]  ivy, it's got every spectrum it needs.
[01:46:10.910 --> 01:46:14.390]  And now we take it underneath these artificial lights.
[01:46:14.390 --> 01:46:15.230]  And for so long,
[01:46:15.230 --> 01:46:17.510]  they've been bred under HPS and metal halide,
[01:46:17.510 --> 01:46:20.550]  which we know today are the worst fucking form
[01:46:20.550 --> 01:46:21.870]  of grow lights that we can get.
[01:46:21.870 --> 01:46:23.850]  These are fucking streetlights that have a peak
[01:46:23.850 --> 01:46:28.390]  in one spectrum and they're missing everything else
[01:46:28.390 --> 01:46:31.430]  to make that plant be genetically steered
[01:46:31.430 --> 01:46:33.190]  for the traits that we're looking for.
[01:46:33.190 --> 01:46:34.710]  You go collect a Colombian
[01:46:34.710 --> 01:46:37.070]  and take it to a bedroom with a blurple light
[01:46:37.070 --> 01:46:38.750]  and think that you're steering that plant
[01:46:38.750 --> 01:46:40.470]  in any direction other than the opposite way
[01:46:40.470 --> 01:46:42.670]  it evolutionarily was steered already.
[01:46:42.670 --> 01:46:43.630]  You gotta be tripping.
[01:46:43.630 --> 01:46:44.710]  You don't understand the plant.
[01:46:44.710 --> 01:46:47.550]  If you don't think those are environmental stressors
[01:46:47.550 --> 01:46:51.030]  to take a plant that was grown outside for millennia
[01:46:51.030 --> 01:46:53.710]  and now grow it in a fucking tent or even a facility
[01:46:53.710 --> 01:46:55.630]  that's the a hundred by a hundred,
[01:46:55.630 --> 01:46:59.670]  you are artificially adjusting the way the chromosomes
[01:46:59.670 --> 01:47:01.230]  decide to pop out of that plant.
[01:47:01.230 --> 01:47:02.950]  The traits that are gonna be shown
[01:47:02.990 --> 01:47:05.230]  are completely different that were there naturally.
[01:47:05.230 --> 01:47:08.070]  And now I'm growing in a room, even if I'm a larger breeder,
[01:47:08.070 --> 01:47:10.950]  I still breed under one specific environment.
[01:47:10.950 --> 01:47:13.230]  I've got my temperature set at one temperature.
[01:47:13.230 --> 01:47:15.230]  I've got the moisture level in my root system
[01:47:15.230 --> 01:47:17.390]  at one set moisture level,
[01:47:17.390 --> 01:47:22.390]  the vapor pressure deficits at a specific humidity.
[01:47:22.630 --> 01:47:25.770]  I've got my bed size set to a specific size.
[01:47:25.770 --> 01:47:29.310]  I'm running endogenous microorganisms or indigenous,
[01:47:29.310 --> 01:47:32.190]  I'm sorry, or I'm doing all kinds of shit
[01:47:32.190 --> 01:47:34.590]  that most of the other growers that are gonna get my seeds
[01:47:34.590 --> 01:47:35.950]  aren't gonna grow like, right?
[01:47:35.950 --> 01:47:37.110]  They're running synthetic.
[01:47:37.110 --> 01:47:38.910]  One guy's doing hydroponic.
[01:47:38.910 --> 01:47:40.190]  Another guy's, like I said,
[01:47:40.190 --> 01:47:42.190]  I used to have a buddy that used to take
[01:47:42.190 --> 01:47:43.790]  all the rotted meat in his kitchen
[01:47:43.790 --> 01:47:45.310]  and put it in a bucket for two weeks.
[01:47:45.310 --> 01:47:48.270]  And that was what he used to fertilize all his plants with.
[01:47:48.270 --> 01:47:49.830]  Nothing else, but rotted meat.
[01:47:49.830 --> 01:47:50.910]  And then they'd always die.
[01:47:50.910 --> 01:47:52.270]  He never finished a garden once.
[01:47:52.270 --> 01:47:54.750]  And he didn't know what the fuck was going on, right?
[01:47:54.750 --> 01:47:56.990]  Cause he always heard you could take a fish
[01:47:56.990 --> 01:47:59.270]  and put it at the bottom of your fucking hole
[01:47:59.270 --> 01:48:01.630]  and you'll have good pot the next year.
[01:48:01.630 --> 01:48:04.870]  He don't understand that the microbes broke down the fish
[01:48:04.870 --> 01:48:06.990]  and the fish then became amino acids
[01:48:06.990 --> 01:48:08.430]  that were available to the plant
[01:48:08.430 --> 01:48:10.390]  that helped start protein synthesis,
[01:48:10.390 --> 01:48:11.950]  which divided all the cells,
[01:48:11.950 --> 01:48:15.110]  but it also took sugars and microbes and amino acids.
[01:48:15.110 --> 01:48:16.670]  All he fucking heard about was a fish
[01:48:16.670 --> 01:48:17.990]  at the bottom of a hole.
[01:48:17.990 --> 01:48:19.950]  So he would take all the meat cause he was a cook.
[01:48:19.950 --> 01:48:20.990]  I used to cook with this cat.
[01:48:20.990 --> 01:48:23.110]  I've known him since we were like 16.
[01:48:23.110 --> 01:48:25.830]  So he's filling up five and seven gallon buckets
[01:48:25.830 --> 01:48:29.870]  with fucking tri-tip and chicken, fucking sausages
[01:48:29.870 --> 01:48:31.350]  and letting them rot in the sun.
[01:48:32.070 --> 01:48:34.430]  And then he goes dumping it in the bottom of every bucket
[01:48:34.430 --> 01:48:35.270]  equals amount.
[01:48:35.270 --> 01:48:36.590]  He'd take a cup and throw it in there
[01:48:36.590 --> 01:48:37.590]  and he's growing his plants.
[01:48:37.590 --> 01:48:39.710]  So as soon as the roots hit the bottom of that shit,
[01:48:39.710 --> 01:48:44.390]  they hit this slimy anaerobic mess and just fucking die.
[01:48:44.390 --> 01:48:47.030]  Cause he never took the time to finish reading
[01:48:47.030 --> 01:48:48.390]  what he started reading.
[01:48:48.390 --> 01:48:50.470]  He just heard you get better weed with a fish
[01:48:50.470 --> 01:48:51.710]  at the bottom of a hole.
[01:48:51.710 --> 01:48:52.950]  And this was his science.
[01:48:52.950 --> 01:48:54.990]  And this is how bro science works.
[01:48:54.990 --> 01:48:57.830]  When a person thinks they're gonna be the next fucking
[01:48:57.830 --> 01:49:00.710]  Jack Herrera and be famous for life
[01:49:00.750 --> 01:49:03.510]  because they came up with this fucking brand new technique
[01:49:03.510 --> 01:49:05.470]  that just ain't jack shit.
[01:49:05.470 --> 01:49:06.670]  You don't know nothing about it.
[01:49:06.670 --> 01:49:08.230]  It's fucking killing your plants.
[01:49:08.230 --> 01:49:10.270]  You couldn't describe it to the next dude correctly
[01:49:10.270 --> 01:49:11.110]  if you had to.
[01:49:12.390 --> 01:49:15.030]  And you're using it on a line that isn't real.
[01:49:15.030 --> 01:49:16.990]  You bought some fake seeds from some jackass
[01:49:16.990 --> 01:49:18.510]  that made a copy of some shit that wasn't real
[01:49:18.510 --> 01:49:19.550]  to start with.
[01:49:19.550 --> 01:49:22.270]  And now everything you did in your garden is a hundred
[01:49:22.270 --> 01:49:23.430]  percent fact.
[01:49:23.430 --> 01:49:24.750]  That's our cannabis community.
[01:49:24.750 --> 01:49:27.390]  That's why CalMag went for so long with everybody
[01:49:27.390 --> 01:49:29.230]  think just don't CalMag, it'll fix it.
[01:49:29.550 --> 01:49:30.390]  They couldn't even tell you
[01:49:30.390 --> 01:49:32.630]  that that's a potassium deficiency
[01:49:32.630 --> 01:49:34.830]  or the plants got light sickness.
[01:49:34.830 --> 01:49:36.190]  You got too much light in the room.
[01:49:36.190 --> 01:49:37.390]  Nobody's asking that question
[01:49:37.390 --> 01:49:39.470]  before they answer the fucking question.
[01:49:39.470 --> 01:49:41.030]  They're just like, this is what it is.
[01:49:41.030 --> 01:49:43.590]  And that's how you get fucked up answers.
[01:49:43.590 --> 01:49:46.310]  And that's how your garden gets worse and worse and worse
[01:49:46.310 --> 01:49:48.630]  until finally you're like, I fucked this shit.
[01:49:48.630 --> 01:49:50.070]  I wanna grow some fucking food
[01:49:50.070 --> 01:49:52.870]  or I wanna grow some herb that I'm proud of.
[01:49:52.870 --> 01:49:55.190]  I'm tired of wanting to shine with this bullshit.
[01:49:55.190 --> 01:49:56.390]  Shine with the knowledge.
[01:49:56.390 --> 01:49:58.830]  Because if you can teach someone to farm anything
[01:49:59.430 --> 01:50:00.870]  cannabis is easy.
[01:50:00.870 --> 01:50:02.910]  Yeah, got that right.
[01:50:02.910 --> 01:50:04.270]  Yeah, let's do 20 packs.
[01:50:04.270 --> 01:50:05.510]  I see Peter, he did 20.
[01:50:05.510 --> 01:50:07.430]  We'll do 20 double packs for today.
[01:50:08.590 --> 01:50:10.870]  Let's see how we can sell those suckers out.
[01:50:10.870 --> 01:50:11.710]  No problem.
[01:50:11.710 --> 01:50:13.950]  A bunch of people ordered packs
[01:50:13.950 --> 01:50:18.190]  and then someone said that they were, sorry,
[01:50:18.190 --> 01:50:19.510]  that they were out of stock.
[01:50:19.510 --> 01:50:21.390]  So I just threw 20 up.
[01:50:21.390 --> 01:50:22.470]  Yeah, I'll send them to you.
[01:50:22.470 --> 01:50:24.830]  Just let me, when they all get out, I'll pack them up
[01:50:24.830 --> 01:50:27.350]  and I'll have Matt in the next day or two.
[01:50:27.350 --> 01:50:28.190]  Look at us.
[01:50:28.510 --> 01:50:29.990]  It's like the three of us are standing by
[01:50:29.990 --> 01:50:31.670]  to take your order right now.
[01:50:33.030 --> 01:50:37.310]  And, and, look at this customer support team.
[01:50:37.310 --> 01:50:38.870]  Brand new slaps that I got in.
[01:50:38.870 --> 01:50:41.670]  So I'll be sending you a bunch of slaps too.
[01:50:41.670 --> 01:50:42.510]  Excellent.
[01:50:42.510 --> 01:50:44.070]  Yeah, people love their slaps.
[01:50:45.350 --> 01:50:49.430]  Vinyl, they're waterproof, UV resistant.
[01:50:49.430 --> 01:50:51.790]  They're way bigger than the other ones I sent you.
[01:50:51.790 --> 01:50:52.630]  This is what the other ones were.
[01:50:52.630 --> 01:50:54.590]  By the way, where do you print yours up?
[01:50:55.590 --> 01:50:58.590]  These ones I did at, let me check.
[01:50:58.590 --> 01:50:59.990]  I think it's called Sticker Pros.
[01:50:59.990 --> 01:51:03.290]  They got a deal right now for 200 for 55 bucks.
[01:51:04.790 --> 01:51:05.630]  They're dirt cheap.
[01:51:05.630 --> 01:51:07.550]  Cause my last ones I had to pay a hundred bucks
[01:51:07.550 --> 01:51:08.670]  for a hundred of them.
[01:51:08.670 --> 01:51:10.530]  Like I just got a sweet deal.
[01:51:12.170 --> 01:51:14.230]  Let me make sure it's Sticker Pros.
[01:51:16.710 --> 01:51:20.230]  And let me see, I like this space shirt.
[01:51:20.230 --> 01:51:22.070]  Yes, it's Sticker Pros.
[01:51:22.070 --> 01:51:24.750]  This is artwork done by my cousin, Jesse Pacheco.
[01:51:24.750 --> 01:51:26.070]  He's a tattoo artist.
[01:51:26.070 --> 01:51:29.190]  And he did all the artwork of my first art series lines.
[01:51:29.190 --> 01:51:31.470]  There's one for Nana Cookie, Space Kush,
[01:51:32.590 --> 01:51:34.990]  Angel Backcross 2, Skeet Skeet.
[01:51:36.350 --> 01:51:37.710]  What else did I do one for?
[01:51:37.710 --> 01:51:39.390]  I've got one coming for the Fyro G.
[01:51:39.390 --> 01:51:42.070]  Cause I'm gonna, I've been planning a Fyro G reversal
[01:51:42.070 --> 01:51:44.350]  for almost a decade.
[01:51:44.350 --> 01:51:46.070]  And then I lost the plant when I lost my leg
[01:51:46.070 --> 01:51:47.030]  and I just got her back.
[01:51:47.030 --> 01:51:50.430]  So after the Space Cheese, I'm doing a Fyro G reversal.
[01:51:50.430 --> 01:51:53.390]  And I'm gonna be dumping some fucking OGs on everybody.
[01:51:55.750 --> 01:51:57.070]  Yes, Greens Goddess.
[01:51:57.070 --> 01:52:00.270]  I will try to remember that specifically
[01:52:00.270 --> 01:52:02.390]  you want the alien sticker.
[01:52:02.390 --> 01:52:04.150]  Or if she hits me up on Instagram,
[01:52:04.150 --> 01:52:05.310]  I'll send it to her myself
[01:52:05.310 --> 01:52:06.790]  and you don't have to worry about it.
[01:52:06.790 --> 01:52:08.190]  If she wants the sticker.
[01:52:10.990 --> 01:52:14.630]  If I forget to send you that specific sticker,
[01:52:14.630 --> 01:52:17.990]  you can remind us and I'll get another one out.
[01:52:18.630 --> 01:52:23.630]  But let me try to catch up on the questions and comments.
[01:52:24.310 --> 01:52:29.310]  And this is a, look at those, a variety of stickers.
[01:52:29.870 --> 01:52:30.710]  It's pretty awesome.
[01:52:30.710 --> 01:52:31.830]  What's doing.
[01:52:34.350 --> 01:52:36.990]  Now, and I saw before someone agreed with me
[01:52:36.990 --> 01:52:40.030]  in the comments, like I'd rather see you survive
[01:52:40.030 --> 01:52:43.670]  financially and you know, like your step 50 bucks
[01:52:43.670 --> 01:52:46.790]  is for what people get from you.
[01:52:48.990 --> 01:52:52.430]  Like, I kind of want to push you to
[01:52:52.430 --> 01:52:54.190]  with some stuff up the price.
[01:52:54.190 --> 01:52:55.590]  And I know there's kind of like
[01:52:55.590 --> 01:52:57.270]  the medical patient contingent.
[01:52:57.270 --> 01:52:59.150]  And it's almost like I'd rather give those people
[01:52:59.150 --> 01:53:04.150]  stuff for free and have the community support you
[01:53:04.390 --> 01:53:08.310]  and what you're doing versus you like struggling
[01:53:08.310 --> 01:53:10.550]  to get by on a daily basis.
[01:53:10.550 --> 01:53:11.590]  So.
[01:53:11.590 --> 01:53:14.270]  Hey man, this is, it's only one day.
[01:53:14.270 --> 01:53:15.950]  So like, if we were doing it all month,
[01:53:15.950 --> 01:53:17.070]  that that might be a worry,
[01:53:17.150 --> 01:53:20.150]  but we're just doing 20 packs on one day on 420.
[01:53:20.150 --> 01:53:22.870]  That's my way of telling everyone that supported me
[01:53:22.870 --> 01:53:26.750]  through your platform and all the other breeders
[01:53:26.750 --> 01:53:28.910]  that were there, because if they go look at my shit,
[01:53:28.910 --> 01:53:30.510]  they're going to see something from someone else
[01:53:30.510 --> 01:53:31.350]  that they may want.
[01:53:31.350 --> 01:53:33.510]  And because they're getting double one of mine,
[01:53:33.510 --> 01:53:35.950]  they might decide to pick up some from someone else
[01:53:35.950 --> 01:53:37.310]  because they could take that double pack.
[01:53:37.310 --> 01:53:38.550]  I'm going to send you two.
[01:53:38.550 --> 01:53:40.630]  It won't be one pack with double seeds in it.
[01:53:40.630 --> 01:53:41.590]  You're going to get two packs.
[01:53:41.590 --> 01:53:44.430]  So you can take a second pack and donate it to an auction.
[01:53:44.430 --> 01:53:46.270]  You can pass it to your buddy.
[01:53:46.270 --> 01:53:47.670]  Just don't start like I,
[01:53:47.670 --> 01:53:50.030]  one dude traded me a bunch of seeds one time.
[01:53:50.030 --> 01:53:51.070]  And the next thing you know,
[01:53:51.070 --> 01:53:53.590]  he's up on one of these websites selling my gear
[01:53:53.590 --> 01:53:55.470]  for more than I charged for him.
[01:53:55.470 --> 01:53:56.310]  Right.
[01:53:56.310 --> 01:53:57.150]  And then when I hit the website up,
[01:53:57.150 --> 01:54:00.470]  they blocked me and shit and continued selling my seeds
[01:54:00.470 --> 01:54:03.110]  for a higher price from some jackass
[01:54:03.110 --> 01:54:04.630]  that got them from me for free.
[01:54:04.630 --> 01:54:05.510]  Right.
[01:54:05.510 --> 01:54:08.750]  Like I don't care if people use my stuff to help people,
[01:54:08.750 --> 01:54:11.350]  but like if you got 10 packs from me for free,
[01:54:11.350 --> 01:54:12.830]  you don't get to go sell all those fuckers
[01:54:12.830 --> 01:54:13.710]  for a hundred bucks a pack.
[01:54:13.710 --> 01:54:14.550]  Right.
[01:54:14.550 --> 01:54:15.750]  That's, that's when you get catch,
[01:54:16.710 --> 01:54:18.870]  you get caught by, by Billy bag seed right here.
[01:54:18.870 --> 01:54:20.870]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:54:20.870 --> 01:54:24.710]  This is how, check this out.
[01:54:24.710 --> 01:54:27.230]  This is my, this is called Billy bag seed.
[01:54:27.230 --> 01:54:28.990]  He's the dude that does all the reversals for me
[01:54:28.990 --> 01:54:31.950]  by using silver and he spits on the plants, right?
[01:54:32.870 --> 01:54:35.470]  What's up y'all, Billy bag seed, how you doing?
[01:54:35.470 --> 01:54:37.190]  I'm not here to do something.
[01:54:37.190 --> 01:54:42.110]  I've been doing this shit for years, man.
[01:54:42.110 --> 01:54:44.150]  This, that it's turquoise Tony, man.
[01:54:44.150 --> 01:54:45.430]  He turned into Billy bag seed.
[01:54:46.070 --> 01:54:48.150]  This is the dude that sells you all the knockoff S ones,
[01:54:48.150 --> 01:54:49.550]  all the fake shit.
[01:54:49.550 --> 01:54:51.270]  This is the dude you're supporting
[01:54:51.270 --> 01:54:53.550]  when you should be hitting up the real fucking breeder
[01:54:53.550 --> 01:54:55.390]  for the real strain that was created
[01:54:55.390 --> 01:54:57.190]  that you're really fucking after.
[01:54:57.190 --> 01:55:00.710]  Quit hitting up these lames that bought somebody else's seeds
[01:55:00.710 --> 01:55:02.870]  and made fucking S ones or F twos off them
[01:55:02.870 --> 01:55:05.750]  and sold them for cheaper or put five extra seeds in it.
[01:55:05.750 --> 01:55:07.830]  So you buy it because you want the name
[01:55:07.830 --> 01:55:09.310]  and not the actual strain.
[01:55:09.310 --> 01:55:11.670]  Y'all are why this shit's all fucked up.
[01:55:11.670 --> 01:55:13.710]  All of us, me, we all did this.
[01:55:13.750 --> 01:55:16.750]  We've all at one time went and bought shit from the wrong dude
[01:55:16.750 --> 01:55:18.350]  because we either didn't know
[01:55:18.350 --> 01:55:21.350]  or because we didn't care because he was an asshole.
[01:55:21.350 --> 01:55:23.670]  Like let's start supporting the real people
[01:55:24.190 --> 01:55:27.070]  that really do this shit and that really care about
[01:55:27.070 --> 01:55:30.070]  whether or not you guys are getting the real shit, right?
[01:55:30.070 --> 01:55:32.110]  They'll teach you how to plant it, to grow it,
[01:55:32.110 --> 01:55:35.150]  reproduce it, clone it, pass it to the next dude.
[01:55:35.150 --> 01:55:37.590]  They'll teach you every failure they had.
[01:55:37.590 --> 01:55:39.110]  Instead, you guys are supporting the dude
[01:55:39.110 --> 01:55:40.470]  with the shiny photos out there.
[01:55:40.470 --> 01:55:42.710]  You got to quit.
[01:55:42.710 --> 01:55:44.230]  Don't support Billy Bag Seed.
[01:55:44.230 --> 01:55:46.670]  He's a front. Billy Bag Seed's tripping.
[01:55:47.950 --> 01:55:49.750]  Don't fuck with him.
[01:55:49.750 --> 01:55:51.110]  I'm coming from this guy.
[01:55:51.110 --> 01:55:53.870]  You don't make 50,000 hay seeds and sell them for cheap
[01:55:53.870 --> 01:55:55.590]  if you're trying to get rich.
[01:55:55.590 --> 01:55:58.030]  You do that if you want people growing hays, man.
[01:55:58.030 --> 01:56:01.230]  I could raise it 25% and still be 25% cheaper
[01:56:01.230 --> 01:56:03.790]  than the next dude with hay seeds, for real.
[01:56:03.790 --> 01:56:06.990]  My shit is cheaper than everybody for hays and it's legit.
[01:56:06.990 --> 01:56:08.750]  You guys ask about test reports
[01:56:08.750 --> 01:56:11.110]  and who did all these stabilizations.
[01:56:11.110 --> 01:56:14.630]  I've shown you that shit since 2012
[01:56:14.630 --> 01:56:16.750]  and you guys are still sleeping on hay seeds.
[01:56:16.750 --> 01:56:18.310]  You're out there buying shit that said hays
[01:56:18.310 --> 01:56:19.550]  because Neville died.
[01:56:19.550 --> 01:56:21.870]  Instead of buying something that somebody showed you
[01:56:21.870 --> 01:56:24.390]  with proof in his garden and other gardens
[01:56:24.390 --> 01:56:26.990]  and with test reports that it's a hays.
[01:56:26.990 --> 01:56:29.150]  Instead, you guys are out there buying bullshit
[01:56:29.150 --> 01:56:31.330]  and this happens with every strain out there.
[01:56:31.330 --> 01:56:34.190]  There's dudes out there that have real cuts
[01:56:34.190 --> 01:56:35.550]  that are making you versions.
[01:56:35.550 --> 01:56:38.190]  Like if there's a bub out there and you can't get the clone,
[01:56:38.190 --> 01:56:41.110]  hit up CSI and buy the S1s from him
[01:56:41.110 --> 01:56:44.990]  because he's passing you a real genetic version
[01:56:44.990 --> 01:56:46.030]  of that plant.
[01:56:46.030 --> 01:56:49.030]  Quit buying shit from a dude that is selling you
[01:56:49.030 --> 01:56:50.550]  something with just has that name.
[01:56:50.550 --> 01:56:52.150]  I'm not gonna tell you, but like,
[01:56:52.150 --> 01:56:54.550]  they've been brought up on a bunch of forums
[01:56:54.550 --> 01:56:56.470]  where people buy shit because it has the name.
[01:56:56.470 --> 01:56:58.990]  There are actual clones that have had these names
[01:56:58.990 --> 01:57:00.390]  for longer than those seed companies,
[01:57:00.390 --> 01:57:05.390]  like Bubba Kush and SFV and Tahoe and Ghost and Triangle.
[01:57:05.630 --> 01:57:07.430]  Like if you really want that cut,
[01:57:07.430 --> 01:57:08.670]  get that cut, track it down.
[01:57:08.670 --> 01:57:10.710]  If you just want the genetic version,
[01:57:10.710 --> 01:57:12.990]  buy it from a dude that has the actual plant.
[01:57:12.990 --> 01:57:15.750]  If you just want the name, quit frontin'.
[01:57:15.750 --> 01:57:18.070]  Just buy anything and call it that shit.
[01:57:18.070 --> 01:57:18.950]  Quit frontin'.
[01:57:18.950 --> 01:57:20.630]  I don't know if you were listening earlier,
[01:57:20.630 --> 01:57:23.590]  but I was talking about how an unnamed seed company
[01:57:23.590 --> 01:57:25.790]  embarrassed me in front of some guys
[01:57:25.790 --> 01:57:27.090]  that I highly respected.
[01:57:27.950 --> 01:57:28.790]  I heard you, bro.
[01:57:28.790 --> 01:57:30.830]  I came up with something that wasn't correct
[01:57:30.830 --> 01:57:33.630]  and they called me on it, but I learned really early,
[01:57:33.630 --> 01:57:36.590]  you gotta do that research and find out who did what,
[01:57:36.590 --> 01:57:38.630]  where's it coming from, and get to,
[01:57:38.630 --> 01:57:40.190]  if you wanna get it these days,
[01:57:40.190 --> 01:57:44.350]  go as close to that source as you absolutely can.
[01:57:44.350 --> 01:57:47.310]  And it's been like that since the early 2000s with me.
[01:57:47.310 --> 01:57:50.870]  I just had to, I had to get, I've always been a bookworm.
[01:57:50.870 --> 01:57:53.430]  My mom made me that way, so I like reading.
[01:57:53.430 --> 01:57:55.790]  So it's not hard for me to do research.
[01:57:55.790 --> 01:57:57.190]  So I enjoy it.
[01:57:57.190 --> 01:57:58.910]  So, and I like learning.
[01:57:58.910 --> 01:58:01.510]  As if you're not learning, you're not living.
[01:58:01.510 --> 01:58:02.350]  It's something that I've had-
[01:58:02.350 --> 01:58:03.190]  My first attention in school
[01:58:03.190 --> 01:58:04.590]  was for trying to check out a book
[01:58:04.590 --> 01:58:06.270]  that was, the school said was higher
[01:58:06.270 --> 01:58:07.510]  than my grade level and shit.
[01:58:07.510 --> 01:58:08.910]  So I got detention for that shit.
[01:58:08.910 --> 01:58:11.750]  My mom came down there and tried to kick the librarian's ass
[01:58:11.750 --> 01:58:13.390]  and ended up becoming the librarian
[01:58:13.390 --> 01:58:15.790]  so I could check out any book I fucking wanted.
[01:58:15.790 --> 01:58:17.470]  My mom was like, if the book's in the fucking school
[01:58:17.470 --> 01:58:18.830]  and my kid wants to read it,
[01:58:18.830 --> 01:58:21.310]  you guys are gonna help him carry it to the fucking desk
[01:58:21.310 --> 01:58:22.950]  if he has, he can't carry the motherfucker
[01:58:22.950 --> 01:58:24.470]  if it's the biggest dictionary.
[01:58:24.470 --> 01:58:26.230]  Why are you telling the kid he can't read?
[01:58:26.230 --> 01:58:28.030]  You guys are fucking ignorant, man.
[01:58:28.030 --> 01:58:29.110]  I'm out of school.
[01:58:29.110 --> 01:58:31.210]  They're telling the kid he can't read, right?
[01:58:31.210 --> 01:58:32.870]  I wasn't beating up nobody.
[01:58:32.870 --> 01:58:33.950]  I wasn't stealing shit.
[01:58:34.310 --> 01:58:36.150]  I wasn't breaking paper or pencils.
[01:58:36.150 --> 01:58:37.430]  I'm trying to read a book
[01:58:37.430 --> 01:58:39.030]  and I get detention for that shit.
[01:58:39.030 --> 01:58:41.070]  So like, I took pride in reading shit.
[01:58:41.070 --> 01:58:42.150]  On the other side of this wall,
[01:58:42.150 --> 01:58:44.270]  I got about 3000 books in a library.
[01:58:44.270 --> 01:58:45.910]  I've read every book in there.
[01:58:45.910 --> 01:58:47.710]  And I still wanna continue to read books
[01:58:47.710 --> 01:58:50.930]  because I know from reading the information in those books
[01:58:50.930 --> 01:58:52.530]  that I don't know jack shit.
[01:58:52.530 --> 01:58:53.750]  There's so many more books
[01:58:53.750 --> 01:58:55.830]  that have the information out there that I want
[01:58:55.830 --> 01:58:57.790]  that I just continue to look for it.
[01:58:57.790 --> 01:59:00.070]  And it becomes second nature to research it.
[01:59:00.070 --> 01:59:02.710]  So like if someone, you got called out by your buddies
[01:59:02.710 --> 01:59:03.950]  for herb that was wrong,
[01:59:03.950 --> 01:59:05.750]  it wasn't to make you look like an idiot
[01:59:05.750 --> 01:59:08.390]  or to be a pure dick, right?
[01:59:08.390 --> 01:59:10.110]  They probably just like that shit.
[01:59:10.110 --> 01:59:11.670]  They get tired of seeing the wrong shit.
[01:59:11.670 --> 01:59:14.290]  They're gonna tell you so that it helps you out
[01:59:14.290 --> 01:59:15.770]  and everybody else out
[01:59:15.770 --> 01:59:18.390]  and then cuts off the jackass is selling the fake.
[01:59:19.390 --> 01:59:20.230]  That's what we're supposed to be.
[01:59:20.230 --> 01:59:21.230]  Absolutely, it taught me a lesson.
[01:59:21.230 --> 01:59:22.790]  It taught me to do my research.
[01:59:22.790 --> 01:59:24.670]  I had a lot of really good mentors, man.
[01:59:24.670 --> 01:59:27.550]  And I've always, I was taught to respect my elders.
[01:59:27.550 --> 01:59:29.690]  So I just shut up and listen when I'm around them
[01:59:29.690 --> 01:59:31.430]  and listen to what they have to say.
[01:59:31.790 --> 01:59:34.390]  And take their criticisms.
[01:59:35.670 --> 01:59:36.750]  Come at them with something,
[01:59:36.750 --> 01:59:38.470]  somebody that knows Williams Wonder
[01:59:38.470 --> 01:59:39.870]  and you say, here's some Williams Wonder.
[01:59:39.870 --> 01:59:40.790]  They just laugh.
[01:59:41.910 --> 01:59:44.870]  That teaches you something about life right there.
[01:59:44.870 --> 01:59:46.370]  You wanna do better next time.
[01:59:49.190 --> 01:59:50.070]  Yup, 100%.
[01:59:50.070 --> 01:59:53.010]  So just quickly,
[01:59:54.370 --> 01:59:57.110]  we just sold out of 19 of the 20 packs
[01:59:57.110 --> 01:59:58.670]  in the past 15 minutes.
[01:59:58.670 --> 02:00:01.670]  Do you want me to put more packs up or?
[02:00:01.670 --> 02:00:02.590]  Let me see here.
[02:00:04.470 --> 02:00:06.430]  I can do, we'll do.
[02:00:08.510 --> 02:00:09.350]  He drops out again.
[02:00:09.350 --> 02:00:11.070]  Cliffhanger, cliffhanger.
[02:00:14.390 --> 02:00:16.830]  Get the wook back on the bicycle out there, man.
[02:00:16.830 --> 02:00:17.670]  Exactly.
[02:00:18.950 --> 02:00:19.790]  Pedal.
[02:00:20.910 --> 02:00:25.910]  Here he comes in three, two, one.
[02:00:29.750 --> 02:00:30.590]  There he is.
[02:00:30.590 --> 02:00:35.590]  That's what you were about to say and you cut out.
[02:00:35.790 --> 02:00:37.230]  I could do 20 more packs.
[02:00:38.030 --> 02:00:39.670]  All right, let me.
[02:00:39.670 --> 02:00:40.950]  Actually do 22.
[02:00:40.950 --> 02:00:44.190]  So that's a total that comes out to 420 sort of right there.
[02:00:44.190 --> 02:00:45.990]  So that's 42 total pack.
[02:00:45.990 --> 02:00:47.550]  Clever.
[02:00:47.550 --> 02:00:48.670]  All right, hold on.
[02:00:51.620 --> 02:00:52.780]  Give me one minute.
[02:00:52.780 --> 02:00:56.660]  And then I wanna go, yeah, I'm like way behind on the
[02:00:56.660 --> 02:01:01.660]  chat and comments.
[02:01:03.180 --> 02:01:06.100]  I'll have them in the mail by Friday to you.
[02:01:06.100 --> 02:01:08.300]  Okay, so anyone who ordered today, just be,
[02:01:08.300 --> 02:01:10.140]  show some patience.
[02:01:10.140 --> 02:01:12.380]  Smoke some weed, show some patience.
[02:01:14.100 --> 02:01:17.220]  Your, a topic we were on a while ago.
[02:01:17.220 --> 02:01:19.380]  Do you want me to do the male cannabis size
[02:01:19.380 --> 02:01:21.460]  or the mega base image first?
[02:01:22.620 --> 02:01:23.740]  Well, they're both the same.
[02:01:23.740 --> 02:01:26.300]  So the mega base is telling you how much of the gamuts
[02:01:26.940 --> 02:01:28.500]  are available through the male and female.
[02:01:28.500 --> 02:01:29.380]  So it shows you right here.
[02:01:29.380 --> 02:01:32.820]  Human sex chromosomes are vastly different in size.
[02:01:32.820 --> 02:01:35.900]  The X chromosome is 153 megabytes
[02:01:35.900 --> 02:01:39.900]  and approximately 833 genes where the human Y is 59.4.
[02:01:41.820 --> 02:01:44.700]  So you are correct in humans.
[02:01:44.700 --> 02:01:45.900]  But when you come down to cannabis,
[02:01:45.900 --> 02:01:50.100]  cannabis has 818 in the female and 843 in the male.
[02:01:50.100 --> 02:01:53.660]  The male has a significantly larger amount
[02:01:53.700 --> 02:01:56.820]  of genetic material to pass in a cross.
[02:01:56.820 --> 02:02:01.220]  So we're constantly removing a lot of the special part
[02:02:01.220 --> 02:02:02.060]  of this plant.
[02:02:02.060 --> 02:02:04.300]  You don't know which part is coming from the male.
[02:02:04.300 --> 02:02:07.420]  Just because it's a male doesn't mean only the males
[02:02:07.420 --> 02:02:09.460]  are gonna receive that information.
[02:02:09.460 --> 02:02:12.700]  This is genetic information that could be steering color,
[02:02:12.700 --> 02:02:17.020]  smell, flower time, bud structure,
[02:02:17.860 --> 02:02:19.940]  whether or not that plant's gonna root it.
[02:02:19.940 --> 02:02:22.820]  You never know what that part of the plant's being steered
[02:02:22.860 --> 02:02:25.540]  by what you're missing by not adding that part to it.
[02:02:25.540 --> 02:02:27.980]  This is why other, like I used to talk to people
[02:02:27.980 --> 02:02:29.780]  that bred vegetables when I was that would come
[02:02:29.780 --> 02:02:32.100]  into my shop, because we couldn't talk about cannabis
[02:02:32.100 --> 02:02:33.900]  if we went to like a hydro store.
[02:02:33.900 --> 02:02:36.100]  So everyone in there I'd have to talk to about other plants
[02:02:36.100 --> 02:02:38.020]  or like you did with people with animals,
[02:02:38.020 --> 02:02:38.900]  chickens or snakes.
[02:02:38.900 --> 02:02:41.020]  Like I do a lot, I hate snakes,
[02:02:41.020 --> 02:02:43.820]  but if you research snake breeding,
[02:02:43.820 --> 02:02:47.860]  those cats are diving deep into how to steer traits
[02:02:47.860 --> 02:02:49.460]  in specific styles, right?
[02:02:49.460 --> 02:02:51.500]  And this can be used to help you with plants
[02:02:51.540 --> 02:02:53.860]  instead of just reading the Punnett square
[02:02:53.860 --> 02:02:55.700]  and trying to think that a Punnett square
[02:02:55.700 --> 02:02:57.780]  is a hundred percent fact, right?
[02:02:57.780 --> 02:02:59.860]  A Punnett square is giving you-
[02:02:59.860 --> 02:03:04.060]  Or useful in every situation.
[02:03:04.060 --> 02:03:07.020]  It's not always time for the Punnett square.
[02:03:07.020 --> 02:03:08.300]  Yep, exactly.
[02:03:08.300 --> 02:03:10.500]  So like, if you have to kind of steer,
[02:03:10.500 --> 02:03:12.580]  dig into other shit, I never knew that the male cannabis
[02:03:12.580 --> 02:03:15.780]  had a larger mega base until I started understanding
[02:03:15.780 --> 02:03:20.220]  that there was the possibility that in certain species,
[02:03:20.260 --> 02:03:23.420]  the male or the female has more information to pass.
[02:03:23.420 --> 02:03:25.380]  And there's probably a reason for it, right?
[02:03:25.380 --> 02:03:27.060]  Maybe the male in that strain
[02:03:27.060 --> 02:03:29.460]  is passing powdery mildew resistance.
[02:03:29.460 --> 02:03:31.060]  That maybe the male never gets it
[02:03:31.060 --> 02:03:33.780]  and it's in its genetic code to pass over.
[02:03:33.780 --> 02:03:37.260]  And you've removed it because you like that one high
[02:03:37.260 --> 02:03:40.060]  from that one girl that you found in 10 seeds
[02:03:40.060 --> 02:03:40.900]  that came from a lot.
[02:03:40.900 --> 02:03:42.980]  Like I made 50,000 hay seeds.
[02:03:42.980 --> 02:03:45.420]  People are buying them and thinking they found
[02:03:45.420 --> 02:03:47.780]  a specific phenotype in the haze.
[02:03:47.780 --> 02:03:50.020]  They've never grown the parents to haze.
[02:03:50.780 --> 02:03:51.740]  How would they ever know that, right?
[02:03:51.740 --> 02:03:54.020]  Or if they find a lemon pheno
[02:03:54.020 --> 02:03:57.180]  and now they believe all hazes taste like lemon,
[02:03:57.180 --> 02:03:59.980]  there was 50,000 other phenotypical expressions
[02:03:59.980 --> 02:04:02.980]  out of that plant that carried from that genotype.
[02:04:02.980 --> 02:04:05.380]  And each seed's genotype is slightly,
[02:04:05.380 --> 02:04:07.060]  slightly different than the next seeds
[02:04:07.060 --> 02:04:11.140]  because it may not have received the allele for purple.
[02:04:11.140 --> 02:04:11.980]  Right?
[02:04:11.980 --> 02:04:12.820]  And this one did.
[02:04:12.820 --> 02:04:13.660]  Right?
[02:04:13.660 --> 02:04:14.500]  So now if I breed with this one,
[02:04:14.500 --> 02:04:16.620]  this one has a recessive purple allele in it
[02:04:16.620 --> 02:04:18.820]  that can pass to other plants with recessive purple,
[02:04:18.820 --> 02:04:22.140]  where I could now get some phenotypes that are purple.
[02:04:22.140 --> 02:04:23.940]  But in the other one, I'll never get it
[02:04:23.940 --> 02:04:25.340]  because she just does not have it.
[02:04:25.340 --> 02:04:27.340]  It did not receive it from either one of the parents
[02:04:27.340 --> 02:04:30.020]  because every seed on the plant is different.
[02:04:30.020 --> 02:04:33.300]  Even if it's a true breeding inbred line,
[02:04:33.300 --> 02:04:36.180]  every seed is different, period.
[02:04:36.180 --> 02:04:38.940]  You quit looking for the mom and dad in those seeds
[02:04:38.940 --> 02:04:43.060]  and look for the beauty in the genetic makeup
[02:04:43.060 --> 02:04:44.420]  that's being passed to you.
[02:04:45.540 --> 02:04:46.380]  Yeah.
[02:04:46.380 --> 02:04:47.700]  You have a triangle cush lemon.
[02:04:47.700 --> 02:04:49.900]  How'd you get a triangle cush lemon?
[02:04:49.900 --> 02:04:50.740]  A male?
[02:04:51.820 --> 02:04:52.980]  Somebody show them.
[02:04:52.980 --> 02:04:55.980]  So just quickly to wrap this part up,
[02:04:55.980 --> 02:05:00.380]  this is the male cannabis size screenshot.
[02:05:01.260 --> 02:05:02.100]  Yes.
[02:05:02.100 --> 02:05:03.980]  And when they're talking about the X being the largest,
[02:05:03.980 --> 02:05:06.180]  they're talking about in the female plants over here.
[02:05:06.180 --> 02:05:09.420]  But if you keep reading down the meiotic configuration
[02:05:09.420 --> 02:05:12.700]  of the sec bivalent locates a pseudo
[02:05:13.700 --> 02:05:15.980]  small region of the Y chromosome
[02:05:15.980 --> 02:05:19.540]  at the end of the eukaryotic CS1 carrying arm
[02:05:19.540 --> 02:05:23.260]  are molecular cytogenetic study of C. sativa sex chromosome
[02:05:23.260 --> 02:05:26.300]  is a starting point to help to make the C. sativa promising.
[02:05:27.180 --> 02:05:28.020]  The X and Y.
[02:05:28.020 --> 02:05:30.020]  I didn't pass the rest.
[02:05:30.020 --> 02:05:32.340]  I got the other one that shows that the rest of that
[02:05:32.340 --> 02:05:33.220]  carries on with the Y.
[02:05:33.220 --> 02:05:34.900]  I didn't send it to you.
[02:05:34.900 --> 02:05:35.860]  Hold on.
[02:05:35.860 --> 02:05:37.060]  Let me see if I got it here.
[02:05:37.060 --> 02:05:37.940]  I got to find it.
[02:05:39.180 --> 02:05:40.380]  It's right next to that one.
[02:05:40.380 --> 02:05:42.780]  I just screenshotted these, so it should be easy.
[02:05:46.810 --> 02:05:47.650]  Yeah, here it is.
[02:05:47.650 --> 02:05:51.130]  Me being cut off from all of you guys out there.
[02:05:51.130 --> 02:05:55.490]  I had to, after realizing that a lot of the stuff
[02:05:55.490 --> 02:05:57.210]  out there, isn't what you say it is.
[02:05:57.210 --> 02:05:59.530]  I decided to go in my own direction
[02:05:59.530 --> 02:06:02.050]  and breed for my own males.
[02:06:02.050 --> 02:06:06.210]  So I kind of have like my own little male line
[02:06:06.210 --> 02:06:08.690]  that I selected specifically males out of it
[02:06:08.690 --> 02:06:10.010]  and smoked them and everything.
[02:06:10.010 --> 02:06:13.050]  I went there cause I, you know, no access to testing.
[02:06:13.170 --> 02:06:15.370]  So the only way to detect THC in a male
[02:06:15.370 --> 02:06:17.010]  that I know of is to smoke him.
[02:06:17.010 --> 02:06:20.010]  I'll reverse it and have it tested.
[02:06:20.010 --> 02:06:22.210]  Like I did with my angel, I reversed angel.
[02:06:22.210 --> 02:06:26.250]  He came out with 11.54% when I tested him reversed.
[02:06:26.250 --> 02:06:27.730]  You can use Ethafon.
[02:06:27.730 --> 02:06:31.330]  Ethafon is a product that a lot of farmers are using
[02:06:31.330 --> 02:06:34.130]  to help ripen their fruit quicker, set fruit.
[02:06:34.130 --> 02:06:35.770]  You can take Ethafon or Florel,
[02:06:35.770 --> 02:06:36.930]  depending on the strength of it,
[02:06:36.930 --> 02:06:40.010]  you'll use that at a specific time.
[02:06:40.010 --> 02:06:40.850]  Depending on the strength of it,
[02:06:40.850 --> 02:06:45.210]  you'll use that at a specific PPM on that male.
[02:06:45.210 --> 02:06:48.210]  And you can reverse a male to give you male and female seed.
[02:06:48.210 --> 02:06:52.010]  So now you have an S1 version in female form of your male
[02:06:52.010 --> 02:06:54.170]  that you can literally smoke the buds of
[02:06:54.170 --> 02:06:57.170]  instead of just smoking the leaf structure off that male.
[02:06:57.170 --> 02:06:59.370]  It's gonna give you the pure true meaning
[02:06:59.370 --> 02:07:01.350]  of what that genotype is showing you.
[02:07:01.350 --> 02:07:04.970]  But you should be able to tell that through the genotypes
[02:07:04.970 --> 02:07:06.570]  in the females that he's paired to.
[02:07:06.570 --> 02:07:08.950]  So if you made your male, you have females.
[02:07:08.990 --> 02:07:11.910]  So it shows you what's coming out of there.
[02:07:11.910 --> 02:07:12.790]  It just doesn't show you
[02:07:12.790 --> 02:07:15.710]  what he's breeding homogeneously for.
[02:07:15.710 --> 02:07:18.190]  It does show you what's available in the genotype
[02:07:18.190 --> 02:07:20.990]  by popping enough of the females that he came from
[02:07:20.990 --> 02:07:23.310]  to where you really don't have to make an S1 of him
[02:07:23.310 --> 02:07:25.630]  because if you make an S1, it's an F2,
[02:07:25.630 --> 02:07:27.610]  which means now you're showing a representation
[02:07:27.610 --> 02:07:29.810]  of the parental lines that made him
[02:07:29.810 --> 02:07:32.150]  and not himself or herself.
[02:07:32.150 --> 02:07:34.130]  An S1 is an F2.
[02:07:34.130 --> 02:07:36.070]  That's another thing everyone's got to get into
[02:07:36.070 --> 02:07:36.910]  and understand.
[02:07:36.910 --> 02:07:39.870]  You bought an S1 of triangle cush, you popped it.
[02:07:39.870 --> 02:07:43.310]  You have a genetic information that made triangle cush.
[02:07:43.310 --> 02:07:45.390]  You don't have triangle cush.
[02:07:45.390 --> 02:07:49.430]  It's something that a lot of people don't understand.
[02:07:49.430 --> 02:07:51.730]  Here, I'm gonna pass that to you right now.
[02:07:52.710 --> 02:07:54.030]  Instead of going that direction,
[02:07:54.030 --> 02:07:56.070]  I'm just making sure that he has THC
[02:07:56.070 --> 02:07:59.150]  and he has a good chance of passing on THC.
[02:07:59.150 --> 02:08:00.990]  So I just.
[02:08:00.990 --> 02:08:01.830]  Oh yeah, they do.
[02:08:01.830 --> 02:08:03.350]  You can assemble.
[02:08:03.350 --> 02:08:04.470]  There's another way to test that.
[02:08:04.470 --> 02:08:07.470]  You could put him outside after being in a warm room
[02:08:07.470 --> 02:08:08.990]  and stick him outside in the cold
[02:08:08.990 --> 02:08:12.110]  and he will start to produce trichome coverage
[02:08:12.110 --> 02:08:15.910]  as a defense mechanism to try to warm himself up.
[02:08:15.910 --> 02:08:18.270]  A lot of plants will start to do that.
[02:08:18.270 --> 02:08:19.110]  You don't have to.
[02:08:19.110 --> 02:08:20.710]  Nugget, nugget right there.
[02:08:20.710 --> 02:08:23.350]  That makes a lot of sense too.
[02:08:23.350 --> 02:08:26.230]  It should be coming over to you here in a second, Peter.
[02:08:26.230 --> 02:08:27.190]  The rest of that.
[02:08:28.150 --> 02:08:29.350]  I sent the other screenshot.
[02:08:29.350 --> 02:08:31.630]  I'm just waiting for it to catch my wifi.
[02:08:31.630 --> 02:08:34.070]  Did you text that to me or did you upload it to that?
[02:08:34.670 --> 02:08:35.790]  It's gonna be in the email.
[02:08:35.790 --> 02:08:38.070]  It's gonna be in the lens.
[02:08:38.070 --> 02:08:38.910]  Yeah.
[02:08:38.910 --> 02:08:40.990]  Oh, in the folder in the Google drive.
[02:08:40.990 --> 02:08:41.830]  Yeah, it'll be in the folder.
[02:08:41.830 --> 02:08:42.990]  It's a screenshot.
[02:08:42.990 --> 02:08:43.830]  It's right above.
[02:08:43.830 --> 02:08:46.830]  It's in the same folder with Megabase and the male cannabis.
[02:08:46.830 --> 02:08:50.090]  It's gonna say screenshot 2020 10.
[02:08:50.090 --> 02:08:51.030]  I didn't rename it.
[02:08:53.170 --> 02:08:55.870]  But it's the rest of that conversation
[02:08:55.870 --> 02:08:59.430]  to show that the Y chromosome is the largest.
[02:08:59.430 --> 02:09:03.070]  And they did this with multiple cultivars, not one.
[02:09:03.070 --> 02:09:05.670]  The one I'm showing is when they did purple cush,
[02:09:05.670 --> 02:09:09.830]  but they've also done it with three different hemp lines.
[02:09:09.830 --> 02:09:11.950]  So it's showing that it's going across
[02:09:11.950 --> 02:09:13.990]  the whole family of cannabis
[02:09:13.990 --> 02:09:16.130]  and not just specific THC cultivars.
[02:09:16.130 --> 02:09:17.470]  It's not just type one.
[02:09:17.470 --> 02:09:19.010]  It's showing up in type two plants
[02:09:19.010 --> 02:09:21.930]  that are only CBD producers that don't have THC.
[02:09:21.930 --> 02:09:24.670]  So this is showing you a correlation
[02:09:24.670 --> 02:09:26.550]  to multiple strains of cannabis
[02:09:26.550 --> 02:09:29.970]  having a larger Megabase in the males, not just one plant,
[02:09:29.970 --> 02:09:33.490]  which could be some random bullshit that's happening.
[02:09:33.490 --> 02:09:35.530]  That could not be the facts and be the outlier,
[02:09:35.530 --> 02:09:37.210]  kind of like a purple plant showing up
[02:09:37.210 --> 02:09:40.450]  in a line that never had it, an atavistic trait.
[02:09:40.450 --> 02:09:41.290]  That's another thing.
[02:09:41.290 --> 02:09:42.730]  I like that.
[02:09:42.730 --> 02:09:44.370]  Yeah, and there's another thing
[02:09:44.370 --> 02:09:45.570]  a lot of people don't understand.
[02:09:45.570 --> 02:09:47.370]  When you see, like, right, here we go.
[02:09:47.370 --> 02:09:48.850]  But the three pairs could be distinguished
[02:09:48.850 --> 02:09:49.690]  using the probes.
[02:09:49.690 --> 02:09:52.010]  The Y chromosome is larger than the autosome
[02:09:52.010 --> 02:09:56.330]  and carries a full heterochromatic DAPI positive arm.
[02:09:56.330 --> 02:09:58.570]  CS1 repeats only in the less intense
[02:09:58.570 --> 02:10:01.090]  DAPI stained echromatic arm.
[02:10:01.090 --> 02:10:03.490]  The X is the largest chromosome of all
[02:10:03.490 --> 02:10:08.010]  and carries the CS1 soma of the monadic configuration of sex.
[02:10:08.010 --> 02:10:11.370]  The Y is larger though, in the autosome.
[02:10:11.370 --> 02:10:14.610]  And like I said, it carries 843 Megabase
[02:10:14.610 --> 02:10:19.290]  and the female KR is 818 Megabase.
[02:10:19.290 --> 02:10:21.610]  So there's a difference of 30.
[02:10:21.610 --> 02:10:23.370]  There's a difference of 30 Megabase.
[02:10:23.370 --> 02:10:24.770]  That's 30 billion.
[02:10:24.770 --> 02:10:27.210]  I believe it's a billion gamuts of information
[02:10:27.210 --> 02:10:28.130]  that are in there.
[02:10:28.130 --> 02:10:30.090]  I can't remember off the top of my head.
[02:10:30.090 --> 02:10:32.570]  I'd have to get my shit out of here.
[02:10:32.570 --> 02:10:33.410]  I don't like it.
[02:10:33.410 --> 02:10:34.970]  That's what matters in what we're talking about.
[02:10:34.970 --> 02:10:37.450]  We don't care about the size of the chromosome, the volume.
[02:10:37.450 --> 02:10:38.690]  This is for breeders.
[02:10:38.690 --> 02:10:40.050]  This is not for growers.
[02:10:40.050 --> 02:10:41.090]  The growers don't give a damn.
[02:10:41.090 --> 02:10:41.930]  They're throwing their males out.
[02:10:41.930 --> 02:10:44.170]  But for a breeder, if a breeder doesn't understand
[02:10:44.170 --> 02:10:45.530]  that the males he's breeding with
[02:10:45.530 --> 02:10:47.930]  offer more information than the females,
[02:10:47.930 --> 02:10:50.970]  this is a way to deduce whether or not
[02:10:50.970 --> 02:10:52.370]  the dude you're fucking with
[02:10:52.370 --> 02:10:53.850]  deserves what you're paying him, right?
[02:10:53.850 --> 02:10:56.530]  If he's asking $500 a pack,
[02:10:56.530 --> 02:11:00.250]  and he can't tell you shit about breeding
[02:11:00.250 --> 02:11:02.410]  other than he did it, why are you paying him?
[02:11:02.410 --> 02:11:04.130]  Because of the hype name on the back.
[02:11:04.130 --> 02:11:05.330]  That's what it is.
[02:11:05.330 --> 02:11:07.570]  And now there's a chance that everything you're buying
[02:11:07.570 --> 02:11:10.130]  is bullshit, because you started off with bullshit.
[02:11:10.130 --> 02:11:11.570]  Like the dude didn't know shit.
[02:11:11.570 --> 02:11:13.650]  And how do you know if he didn't know that shit,
[02:11:13.650 --> 02:11:16.210]  how do you know he knew the plants he had were true?
[02:11:16.210 --> 02:11:17.410]  Just because he said they were?
[02:11:17.410 --> 02:11:18.570]  Did he show you the parents grow?
[02:11:18.570 --> 02:11:21.350]  Like I used to show my male and my females
[02:11:21.350 --> 02:11:22.730]  every time I did a breeding room.
[02:11:22.730 --> 02:11:24.530]  That way people could see the structure of the females
[02:11:24.530 --> 02:11:25.550]  I'm growing and my male.
[02:11:25.550 --> 02:11:28.650]  So they knew the sour D I was growing with was a sour D
[02:11:28.650 --> 02:11:30.610]  and the blue dream I had was fucking blue dream.
[02:11:30.610 --> 02:11:32.330]  And the boba I had was boba.
[02:11:32.330 --> 02:11:34.290]  Otherwise they're telling you I'm breeding with boba
[02:11:34.290 --> 02:11:36.210]  in this plant and these are my seeds.
[02:11:36.210 --> 02:11:38.030]  Like right now I've got Chitter Bob out there
[02:11:38.030 --> 02:11:39.450]  doing some testing for me.
[02:11:39.450 --> 02:11:41.770]  I sent him the mom to the line that he's testing
[02:11:41.770 --> 02:11:44.310]  so he can compare the progeny
[02:11:44.310 --> 02:11:46.410]  to the actual mother that made it, right?
[02:11:46.410 --> 02:11:48.250]  I'm not gonna send my males out to no one.
[02:11:48.250 --> 02:11:49.330]  I'm not stupid.
[02:11:49.330 --> 02:11:51.170]  They can copy my lines.
[02:11:51.170 --> 02:11:53.370]  But like if I'm using an elite clone
[02:11:53.370 --> 02:11:55.090]  that's been out there for a decade
[02:11:55.090 --> 02:11:58.230]  and I cross it to my plant that I've had for a decade.
[02:11:58.230 --> 02:12:00.970]  And now you start seeing half of the lines showing
[02:12:00.970 --> 02:12:03.130]  that mother's expression.
[02:12:03.130 --> 02:12:05.130]  You're getting the terpene profile and the structure
[02:12:05.130 --> 02:12:07.630]  and the flower time that you know
[02:12:07.630 --> 02:12:09.430]  that mother's passing those traits.
[02:12:09.430 --> 02:12:12.490]  It's not a homozygous for anything but those.
[02:12:12.490 --> 02:12:14.850]  And they may not even breed true into the progeny
[02:12:14.850 --> 02:12:17.050]  but you can tell that that mother that you use
[02:12:17.050 --> 02:12:19.930]  is passing something by looking at the plant
[02:12:19.930 --> 02:12:23.010]  grown next to its parent, right?
[02:12:23.010 --> 02:12:24.610]  And this is something that I don't see
[02:12:24.610 --> 02:12:26.410]  any other breeders doing.
[02:12:26.410 --> 02:12:28.890]  I just see people posting pictures on Instagram
[02:12:28.890 --> 02:12:30.570]  or Facebook and telling you that this plant's
[02:12:30.570 --> 02:12:32.210]  a copy of this plant.
[02:12:32.210 --> 02:12:34.930]  And it's a top picture of a bud this big.
[02:12:34.930 --> 02:12:37.810]  There's no report of some other grower saying
[02:12:37.810 --> 02:12:41.050]  it tasted like this or it gave me this type of high.
[02:12:41.050 --> 02:12:42.930]  And you guys all continue to say
[02:12:42.930 --> 02:12:45.890]  that nobody's stabilizing any traits.
[02:12:45.890 --> 02:12:48.730]  You guys aren't stabling what you're asking for.
[02:12:49.330 --> 02:12:51.090]  There's cats out here showing some shit.
[02:12:51.090 --> 02:12:51.930]  There's a few.
[02:12:51.930 --> 02:12:54.210]  There's a few dudes willing to show you their fuck up
[02:12:54.210 --> 02:12:56.810]  and their success and not just the picture
[02:12:56.810 --> 02:12:58.730]  at the end of the fucking grow.
[02:12:58.730 --> 02:13:00.490]  And you guys still don't support them.
[02:13:00.490 --> 02:13:02.450]  Like Peter's talking about how low the prices are
[02:13:02.450 --> 02:13:04.130]  on my plant and the amount of work I put in
[02:13:04.130 --> 02:13:07.610]  for over, what, let's see, since 2003
[02:13:07.610 --> 02:13:11.330]  with boneyard seeds and showing it publicly
[02:13:11.330 --> 02:13:13.410]  is ridiculous compared to some people
[02:13:13.410 --> 02:13:15.770]  that are getting paid $1,000.
[02:13:15.770 --> 02:13:17.170]  There's packs out there going for $1,000
[02:13:17.170 --> 02:13:19.090]  with dudes selling you F2 knockoffs
[02:13:19.090 --> 02:13:20.530]  of their F1 knockoffs.
[02:13:20.530 --> 02:13:21.930]  And you guys are buying them.
[02:13:22.850 --> 02:13:23.930]  It's fucking crazy.
[02:13:23.930 --> 02:13:25.210]  And it's all because of a name
[02:13:25.210 --> 02:13:27.770]  and a picture you saw in a book or online.
[02:13:27.770 --> 02:13:29.530]  That's the only reason you buy it.
[02:13:29.530 --> 02:13:32.730]  If you're gonna pay that kind of money for a knockoff.
[02:13:32.730 --> 02:13:36.410]  What's the latest thing, the runs or is that,
[02:13:36.410 --> 02:13:37.810]  am I late with that too?
[02:13:38.690 --> 02:13:39.930]  Oh man, I don't even know.
[02:13:39.930 --> 02:13:42.090]  I don't even track like the hot shit, man.
[02:13:42.090 --> 02:13:44.810]  Since Girl Scout was the last plant I tried to find
[02:13:44.810 --> 02:13:46.850]  because people were asking it for me.
[02:13:47.530 --> 02:13:49.450]  And that was in 2011 when I was at my club.
[02:13:49.450 --> 02:13:52.770]  That's the only reason I tried to fucking track that cut down.
[02:13:52.770 --> 02:13:55.770]  I tracked down seven different cuts of Girl Scout cookies
[02:13:55.770 --> 02:13:57.570]  and only one ended up being real.
[02:13:57.570 --> 02:14:00.890]  The rest were all homophodite knockoff bullshit
[02:14:00.890 --> 02:14:03.450]  that just sucked fucking ass, right?
[02:14:03.450 --> 02:14:04.410]  People were giving them to me.
[02:14:04.410 --> 02:14:05.370]  I was running them.
[02:14:05.370 --> 02:14:06.890]  I kept hitting the guys back up going,
[02:14:06.890 --> 02:14:08.090]  dude, don't put them in your room.
[02:14:08.090 --> 02:14:09.810]  Those things are gonna homophodite on this day.
[02:14:09.810 --> 02:14:11.050]  And they're like, nah.
[02:14:11.050 --> 02:14:14.530]  And then the whole fucking room on day 17 would throw nuts.
[02:14:14.530 --> 02:14:15.410]  They'd fuck the whole room.
[02:14:15.410 --> 02:14:17.170]  I had one dude fill 13 rooms
[02:14:17.170 --> 02:14:19.330]  with fucking fake Girl Scout cookies.
[02:14:19.330 --> 02:14:20.570]  That dude lost fucking air.
[02:14:20.570 --> 02:14:23.850]  He lost his house and everything because the shit was hype.
[02:14:23.850 --> 02:14:27.110]  And he filled every fucking room instead of just one table
[02:14:27.110 --> 02:14:28.610]  to prove it was what it was.
[02:14:28.610 --> 02:14:31.130]  He figured his buddy paid 500 for the trade,
[02:14:31.130 --> 02:14:32.210]  had to be real.
[02:14:32.210 --> 02:14:33.850]  And then I broke down the math on him.
[02:14:33.850 --> 02:14:36.930]  I'm like, dude, you just paid 500 for 50 clones.
[02:14:36.930 --> 02:14:38.650]  We charged $10 a clone.
[02:14:38.650 --> 02:14:39.970]  That's how much a tray of clones costs.
[02:14:39.970 --> 02:14:41.130]  It's 500 bucks.
[02:14:41.130 --> 02:14:43.970]  We usually give it to you for 400 if you buy them all.
[02:14:43.970 --> 02:14:46.650]  But whoever sold you that didn't cut you a deal
[02:14:46.650 --> 02:14:49.570]  and you weren't paying extra for something special.
[02:14:49.570 --> 02:14:51.450]  That's the going rate for clones, dude.
[02:14:51.450 --> 02:14:52.890]  And he was like, what the fuck?
[02:14:52.890 --> 02:14:53.730]  He started doing the math.
[02:14:53.730 --> 02:14:54.550]  He got pissed.
[02:14:54.550 --> 02:14:55.570]  He called the dude up.
[02:14:55.570 --> 02:14:58.130]  He was like, yeah, we paid 500, dude.
[02:14:58.130 --> 02:14:59.010]  I think it's cookies.
[02:14:59.010 --> 02:15:00.250]  That's what the guy said.
[02:15:00.250 --> 02:15:01.130]  The dude got pissed.
[02:15:01.130 --> 02:15:02.610]  He was pissed.
[02:15:02.610 --> 02:15:04.050]  And I'm like, dude, you could have done that shit
[02:15:04.050 --> 02:15:05.650]  before you filled your rooms.
[02:15:06.530 --> 02:15:08.610]  I met you today and told you this shit, dude.
[02:15:08.610 --> 02:15:10.010]  That shit was the first thing on my mind
[02:15:10.010 --> 02:15:13.330]  because I think as a breeder and a cannabis,
[02:15:13.370 --> 02:15:14.210]  this is my job.
[02:15:14.210 --> 02:15:15.030]  It's what I do.
[02:15:15.030 --> 02:15:16.690]  It's not just my hobby.
[02:15:16.690 --> 02:15:18.490]  And if you've got your house on the line
[02:15:18.490 --> 02:15:19.410]  with the shit you're growing,
[02:15:19.410 --> 02:15:21.170]  put the real shit in your room.
[02:15:21.170 --> 02:15:23.650]  Yeah, somebody like that isn't even quarantining
[02:15:23.650 --> 02:15:24.810]  something new coming in.
[02:15:24.810 --> 02:15:27.850]  They don't even know what they're bringing into their,
[02:15:27.850 --> 02:15:31.010]  if they're just, let's, balls to the wall.
[02:15:31.010 --> 02:15:32.450]  Let's throw it all, fill up this room.
[02:15:32.450 --> 02:15:34.450]  You don't know what you're bringing in, man.
[02:15:34.450 --> 02:15:36.930]  They don't care about shit, some people, man.
[02:15:36.930 --> 02:15:38.810]  And this guy didn't even smoke weed.
[02:15:38.810 --> 02:15:40.290]  He just grew it and sold it
[02:15:40.290 --> 02:15:41.850]  so he could pay for everything in his life
[02:15:41.850 --> 02:15:43.450]  because he knew people wanted shit.
[02:15:43.450 --> 02:15:46.610]  So if it was hype, that's what he's after.
[02:15:46.610 --> 02:15:49.210]  Yeah, needed a name that'll sell.
[02:15:49.210 --> 02:15:52.730]  I was at the, he had a wad of hundreds this fucking big
[02:15:52.730 --> 02:15:55.490]  and he's asking everyone for sour diesel seeds.
[02:15:55.490 --> 02:15:57.570]  And I'm like, dude, I ain't got no sour diesel seeds.
[02:15:57.570 --> 02:16:00.530]  I got crosses with diesel, but he's like, no, I want diesel.
[02:16:00.530 --> 02:16:01.770]  I got a fucking wad.
[02:16:01.770 --> 02:16:02.690]  He pulls this wad out.
[02:16:02.690 --> 02:16:05.090]  Every bill here is for sour diesel seeds.
[02:16:05.090 --> 02:16:07.330]  And I'm like, dude, I can't help you, man.
[02:16:07.330 --> 02:16:09.610]  Like someone else probably took his money
[02:16:09.610 --> 02:16:11.610]  and gave him sour diesel seeds, right?
[02:16:12.370 --> 02:16:14.250]  Someone did, but I'm like, nah, bro.
[02:16:14.250 --> 02:16:15.250]  What does he say here?
[02:16:15.250 --> 02:16:17.050]  I've missed 120 days of Teva.
[02:16:17.050 --> 02:16:20.130]  Yeah, my Hayes goes 14 to 20 weeks.
[02:16:20.130 --> 02:16:23.170]  So yeah, 120 days fits right in there easily.
[02:16:23.170 --> 02:16:26.450]  What's sad is he didn't want you to educate him
[02:16:26.450 --> 02:16:28.250]  so that he didn't waste that hundred dollars,
[02:16:28.250 --> 02:16:30.290]  stack a hundred dollar bills on some sour diesel.
[02:16:30.290 --> 02:16:31.690]  He can't sell his education.
[02:16:31.690 --> 02:16:33.530]  He can only sell sour diesel, right?
[02:16:33.530 --> 02:16:35.710]  Wherever he's at, they're paying fucking
[02:16:35.710 --> 02:16:37.210]  too much money for sour diesel.
[02:16:37.210 --> 02:16:38.210]  So that's what he said.
[02:16:38.210 --> 02:16:40.730]  He don't give a shit if it's true or not.
[02:16:40.730 --> 02:16:41.570]  He only wants-
[02:16:41.570 --> 02:16:43.050]  So I'm guessing you didn't have the cut at that time
[02:16:43.050 --> 02:16:44.450]  because I just heard you mention earlier
[02:16:44.450 --> 02:16:46.570]  that you do have the sour diesel cut.
[02:16:46.570 --> 02:16:48.290]  No, I had sour diesel then.
[02:16:48.290 --> 02:16:49.130]  I don't have it now.
[02:16:49.130 --> 02:16:49.970]  I got the Kim D.
[02:16:49.970 --> 02:16:50.810]  Oh, gotcha.
[02:16:50.810 --> 02:16:53.450]  I had AJ sour diesel for quite a while.
[02:16:53.450 --> 02:16:55.390]  I lost it when I lost my leg.
[02:16:55.390 --> 02:16:57.810]  My family couldn't keep me and my garden alive.
[02:16:57.810 --> 02:16:59.810]  So one of them had to go and I'm still here.
[02:16:59.810 --> 02:17:00.650]  Amen.
[02:17:00.650 --> 02:17:02.690]  Good deal, good deal.
[02:17:02.690 --> 02:17:04.330]  I mean, the fact that I had plans for-
[02:17:04.330 --> 02:17:05.330]  I'm happy to have you.
[02:17:05.330 --> 02:17:06.970]  Like the mail you were talking about.
[02:17:06.970 --> 02:17:09.350]  I had my angel mail for 15 years.
[02:17:09.350 --> 02:17:11.790]  I've made 144 crosses with him.
[02:17:11.790 --> 02:17:13.110]  I reversed him.
[02:17:13.110 --> 02:17:14.050]  I did everything I could.
[02:17:14.050 --> 02:17:15.550]  I smoked him, everything.
[02:17:15.550 --> 02:17:17.470]  The only thing I never did was pass him to someone else
[02:17:17.470 --> 02:17:18.670]  so I could get him back
[02:17:18.670 --> 02:17:21.430]  because someone's gonna make my strains, period.
[02:17:21.430 --> 02:17:23.390]  That's just this, that's the community we're in.
[02:17:23.390 --> 02:17:25.950]  So like, that's why I always tell people,
[02:17:25.950 --> 02:17:29.590]  get to know something in your garden besides yourself.
[02:17:29.590 --> 02:17:31.750]  So find a plant that you know nothing about
[02:17:31.750 --> 02:17:32.910]  and learn about that plant.
[02:17:32.910 --> 02:17:36.310]  Learn how cannabis itself gets down
[02:17:36.310 --> 02:17:38.430]  by learning what that plant does.
[02:17:38.430 --> 02:17:39.710]  Truly stress it.
[02:17:39.710 --> 02:17:41.510]  Don't just make your room hot, right?
[02:17:41.510 --> 02:17:43.150]  Make your room hot and flip lights on and off
[02:17:43.150 --> 02:17:45.910]  and make it do shit it's not supposed to
[02:17:45.910 --> 02:17:47.270]  and learn what's doing it
[02:17:47.270 --> 02:17:48.990]  so that you understand when it happens
[02:17:48.990 --> 02:17:50.550]  that some of these causes
[02:17:50.550 --> 02:17:52.710]  are probably what caused that plant to do that.
[02:17:52.710 --> 02:17:55.150]  So force it to become a homorphidite in your room
[02:17:55.150 --> 02:17:56.930]  because you fucking flip the lights on and off
[02:17:56.930 --> 02:17:58.230]  for three weeks, right?
[02:17:58.230 --> 02:18:00.110]  Set your timers to do that.
[02:18:00.110 --> 02:18:01.850]  Fucking over water with cold water
[02:18:01.850 --> 02:18:03.510]  like a lot of you assholes do
[02:18:03.510 --> 02:18:05.550]  to try to fucking make extra trichomes.
[02:18:05.550 --> 02:18:08.070]  Cold water does not make extra trichomes.
[02:18:08.910 --> 02:18:09.990]  It'll make you flip though.
[02:18:09.990 --> 02:18:12.430]  And if it does have extra trichomes, guess what?
[02:18:12.430 --> 02:18:14.430]  They take time to ripen.
[02:18:14.430 --> 02:18:16.070]  There's nothing in that trichome.
[02:18:16.070 --> 02:18:17.690]  It's just a shiny little fucking house
[02:18:17.690 --> 02:18:18.910]  that has nothing in it.
[02:18:18.910 --> 02:18:20.190]  And y'all are pushing booty.
[02:18:20.190 --> 02:18:21.230]  You're making mids.
[02:18:22.150 --> 02:18:24.870]  Grow some cannabinoids on your plant
[02:18:24.870 --> 02:18:27.070]  and quit worrying about whether or not
[02:18:27.070 --> 02:18:28.670]  it looks like it's better.
[02:18:28.670 --> 02:18:30.870]  Find out if it is fucking better.
[02:18:30.870 --> 02:18:33.750]  Like for real, there's so much bro science out here
[02:18:33.750 --> 02:18:35.070]  that people are practicing
[02:18:35.070 --> 02:18:36.270]  that they've actually went through
[02:18:36.270 --> 02:18:37.390]  and done peer review studies
[02:18:37.430 --> 02:18:39.630]  to show that the effects on those
[02:18:39.630 --> 02:18:41.310]  truly aren't what you think you're seeing.
[02:18:41.310 --> 02:18:43.330]  And when you do it in your little four by four tent,
[02:18:43.330 --> 02:18:45.470]  I got four by four tent, right?
[02:18:45.470 --> 02:18:46.750]  So I'm not disintent growers.
[02:18:46.750 --> 02:18:47.890]  There's one behind me here.
[02:18:47.890 --> 02:18:49.750]  I'm just telling you that the fucking environment
[02:18:49.750 --> 02:18:51.190]  that you have in that motherfucker
[02:18:51.190 --> 02:18:54.350]  isn't the environment that plant evolved to be under.
[02:18:54.350 --> 02:18:56.710]  And the two, three or four grows that you've had it in
[02:18:56.710 --> 02:18:58.850]  aren't proof of what you think you're seeing.
[02:18:58.850 --> 02:19:00.190]  It's just not, right?
[02:19:00.190 --> 02:19:02.670]  The light I have here ain't the light you have.
[02:19:02.670 --> 02:19:03.830]  The heat I have in my room
[02:19:03.830 --> 02:19:05.010]  is not the heat you have in your room.
[02:19:05.010 --> 02:19:05.850]  It's not the same.
[02:19:05.850 --> 02:19:07.490]  The outside is different.
[02:19:07.490 --> 02:19:10.450]  You find some shit out that what you're actually doing
[02:19:10.450 --> 02:19:14.130]  isn't hard line facts of this plant
[02:19:14.130 --> 02:19:15.970]  and all of its family.
[02:19:15.970 --> 02:19:18.230]  It's not, it just is not.
[02:19:18.230 --> 02:19:20.150]  There are plants that are truly minocious
[02:19:20.150 --> 02:19:22.190]  that are bred to be seed bearing plants
[02:19:22.190 --> 02:19:24.630]  for seed oil, for bird seed production.
[02:19:24.630 --> 02:19:26.570]  These are truly homorphodite plants.
[02:19:26.570 --> 02:19:30.890]  When you find one seed out of a 30,000 seed batch
[02:19:30.890 --> 02:19:33.730]  that starts to produce pure homorphodite tendencies
[02:19:33.730 --> 02:19:35.690]  does not mean that line's homorphodite.
[02:19:36.530 --> 02:19:37.890]  It doesn't mean the genetics produced it.
[02:19:37.890 --> 02:19:39.890]  Just means that's what happened.
[02:19:39.890 --> 02:19:41.390]  That plant needs to be thrown away.
[02:19:41.390 --> 02:19:43.770]  It's time for you to do some selection in your garden
[02:19:43.770 --> 02:19:45.650]  and remove the one that sucks.
[02:19:46.810 --> 02:19:48.830]  Don't continue it in breeding.
[02:19:48.830 --> 02:19:49.930]  Learn about the plant.
[02:19:49.930 --> 02:19:51.250]  You're right.
[02:19:51.250 --> 02:19:53.830]  People need to know, like realize
[02:19:53.830 --> 02:19:57.090]  that they have their own taste and select for those.
[02:19:57.090 --> 02:19:59.770]  And I spent seven years on that male line
[02:19:59.770 --> 02:20:01.030]  that I was just talking about.
[02:20:01.030 --> 02:20:02.930]  So I could pull out something consistent.
[02:20:02.930 --> 02:20:05.450]  It's like, if I lost a cut, something bad happened.
[02:20:06.210 --> 02:20:09.370]  I'd just go back in and I'd find something else
[02:20:09.370 --> 02:20:12.870]  that's closer, better, hopefully.
[02:20:12.870 --> 02:20:14.850]  But you can just keep going back in
[02:20:14.850 --> 02:20:15.810]  because you know it so well.
[02:20:15.810 --> 02:20:17.970]  You've seen it and it's to your taste.
[02:20:17.970 --> 02:20:18.810]  It's what you like.
[02:20:18.810 --> 02:20:20.810]  And that's what I do with my vegetables too.
[02:20:20.810 --> 02:20:24.770]  I get a tomato seed and then I select
[02:20:24.770 --> 02:20:27.790]  for what works in my environment and also the taste
[02:20:27.790 --> 02:20:29.330]  because you're eating the damn thing.
[02:20:29.330 --> 02:20:31.210]  The same thing with your smoke.
[02:20:31.210 --> 02:20:34.370]  You don't want to waste a lot of time and energy on stuff.
[02:20:34.370 --> 02:20:37.410]  That's just somebody else's dream and not yours.
[02:20:37.410 --> 02:20:38.690]  Make your own plants.
[02:20:39.570 --> 02:20:44.490]  So just quickly, Todd McCormick just got back to me.
[02:20:44.490 --> 02:20:48.790]  He's not in a place that's conducive to talking right now.
[02:20:48.790 --> 02:20:53.170]  So he'll come join us sometime in the future.
[02:20:53.170 --> 02:20:55.210]  Yeah, Todd has lots of information.
[02:20:55.210 --> 02:20:57.690]  I've spoke with Todd for a while, man.
[02:20:57.690 --> 02:21:00.850]  Okay, so here is just Chris Guerrero
[02:21:00.850 --> 02:21:03.130]  wins the persistence award.
[02:21:03.970 --> 02:21:07.170]  He wants to know about train wreck.
[02:21:07.170 --> 02:21:08.450]  Hit up archive seeds.
[02:21:08.450 --> 02:21:10.750]  So Fudge is fucking with the real train wreck.
[02:21:12.370 --> 02:21:14.370]  Good for him keeping that thing going, man.
[02:21:14.370 --> 02:21:18.170]  My grape, my Guavo G crosses have a real train wreck in it.
[02:21:18.170 --> 02:21:19.530]  The grape rep Avalon.
[02:21:21.250 --> 02:21:23.050]  My grape wreck is just the train wreck
[02:21:23.050 --> 02:21:24.610]  that my crew called grape wreck
[02:21:24.610 --> 02:21:27.350]  because it grew gunmetal silver.
[02:21:27.350 --> 02:21:28.450]  We called it grape wreck.
[02:21:28.450 --> 02:21:29.530]  It's just a train wreck.
[02:21:29.530 --> 02:21:30.970]  We had it since 88.
[02:21:31.010 --> 02:21:33.290]  I lost that cut in 2012.
[02:21:35.690 --> 02:21:36.810]  I'll tell you this.
[02:21:36.810 --> 02:21:39.090]  There are different types of train wrecks.
[02:21:39.090 --> 02:21:41.130]  In my day, like I said, I'm an old school dude
[02:21:41.130 --> 02:21:43.330]  even though I don't look it because of my age.
[02:21:43.330 --> 02:21:46.250]  I started smoking in the seventies when I was four years old
[02:21:46.250 --> 02:21:48.590]  and by 81, I'm smoking every day of my life.
[02:21:48.590 --> 02:21:49.570]  My life's cannabis.
[02:21:49.570 --> 02:21:52.650]  So these are the things I was about.
[02:21:52.650 --> 02:21:54.690]  So the train wreck in my day,
[02:21:54.690 --> 02:21:57.690]  when I was younger, before I was in high school,
[02:21:57.690 --> 02:22:00.270]  train wrecks in the Humboldt area that I knew
[02:22:00.270 --> 02:22:01.170]  were called train wreck
[02:22:01.170 --> 02:22:03.710]  because you ended up with seeds in your herb
[02:22:03.710 --> 02:22:06.150]  and you didn't know what the parent that created it was
[02:22:06.150 --> 02:22:07.470]  because you had no males around.
[02:22:07.470 --> 02:22:09.150]  So you just called it a train wreck.
[02:22:09.150 --> 02:22:11.030]  And then from there, you end up getting these lines
[02:22:11.030 --> 02:22:13.870]  that people call train wreck that come later
[02:22:13.870 --> 02:22:16.990]  that are different, but like what Fletch is running.
[02:22:16.990 --> 02:22:18.510]  That's what people know as train wreck.
[02:22:18.510 --> 02:22:20.430]  What I knew as train wreck was different.
[02:22:20.430 --> 02:22:23.390]  It was this long, lanky, viney plant.
[02:22:23.390 --> 02:22:25.250]  It looked like the Kyber Creeper
[02:22:25.250 --> 02:22:28.450]  that's in the old Teva seed company catalog.
[02:22:28.450 --> 02:22:30.030]  That's what I knew as train wreck.
[02:22:30.790 --> 02:22:33.590]  But what's getting passed around as train wreck later
[02:22:33.590 --> 02:22:36.570]  becomes a shorter squatter plant that's easier to flower.
[02:22:38.550 --> 02:22:39.750]  It's also named train wreck.
[02:22:39.750 --> 02:22:43.790]  So I cannot differentiate why you end up
[02:22:43.790 --> 02:22:45.390]  with those two different names on lines
[02:22:45.390 --> 02:22:47.070]  that are completely different.
[02:22:47.070 --> 02:22:51.110]  It's like the Skywalker OG, Sativa OG,
[02:22:51.110 --> 02:22:55.950]  also known as Hero OG, which got turned into Herowana OG,
[02:22:55.950 --> 02:22:58.350]  like because people weren't paying attention
[02:22:58.350 --> 02:22:59.270]  to what they were reading.
[02:22:59.310 --> 02:23:00.630]  And then they typed the wrong thing in
[02:23:00.630 --> 02:23:03.430]  and then that story gets continued to the next dude.
[02:23:03.430 --> 02:23:06.150]  And now it becomes fact until someone brings up the proof
[02:23:06.150 --> 02:23:08.950]  that it wasn't like that originally, like the Kim dog shit.
[02:23:08.950 --> 02:23:10.670]  I got posts, I go back to 2004
[02:23:10.670 --> 02:23:12.870]  where they're spelling Kim dog, D-A-W-G.
[02:23:12.870 --> 02:23:15.470]  This is three years after they find the Kim D,
[02:23:15.470 --> 02:23:16.530]  or two years even.
[02:23:16.530 --> 02:23:19.350]  And they're already calling it dog with a D-A-W-G.
[02:23:19.350 --> 02:23:23.390]  And now it's always, it's D-O-G, not D-A-W-G.
[02:23:23.390 --> 02:23:25.030]  Like just go back and read the shit
[02:23:25.030 --> 02:23:26.590]  and find out that it don't matter
[02:23:26.590 --> 02:23:28.210]  what how you spell fucking dog,
[02:23:28.210 --> 02:23:29.410]  as long as you got the true cut
[02:23:29.410 --> 02:23:31.330]  and that shit's fucking killer.
[02:23:31.330 --> 02:23:32.930]  That's all that really matters.
[02:23:36.580 --> 02:23:39.020]  What, Hardy here, what's up brother?
[02:23:39.020 --> 02:23:41.820]  What's up, hippie?
[02:23:41.820 --> 02:23:43.260]  Hello, hello.
[02:23:43.260 --> 02:23:44.100]  Homeboy.
[02:23:44.100 --> 02:23:44.940]  How you doing, man?
[02:23:44.940 --> 02:23:46.100]  How you doing, Hardy?
[02:23:46.100 --> 02:23:47.260]  Normal people.
[02:23:50.580 --> 02:23:53.060]  Thought I'd stop in and say hello.
[02:23:53.060 --> 02:23:54.700]  Happy 420, man.
[02:23:54.700 --> 02:23:57.180]  Anthro says, train wreck is a weak Thai expression.
[02:23:57.180 --> 02:24:00.220]  To me, that's what I thought about the train wreck
[02:24:01.060 --> 02:24:01.900]  that I ran.
[02:24:01.900 --> 02:24:04.260]  It had a very Thai expression with the long running.
[02:24:05.780 --> 02:24:08.820]  The branches cannot hold their self up.
[02:24:08.820 --> 02:24:09.660]  They're spindly.
[02:24:09.660 --> 02:24:11.700]  They spread out sideways.
[02:24:13.180 --> 02:24:14.540]  That's what I found in mine.
[02:24:14.540 --> 02:24:16.460]  I was only around train wreck.
[02:24:16.460 --> 02:24:19.380]  It was this lady, it was her weed.
[02:24:19.380 --> 02:24:22.860]  She had MS and her husband went out to California.
[02:24:23.740 --> 02:24:27.340]  Yeah, and brought it back to where they were.
[02:24:27.340 --> 02:24:29.020]  And it was supposedly real deal.
[02:24:29.420 --> 02:24:32.420]  It did help her with her MS,
[02:24:32.420 --> 02:24:35.820]  but I never got to see the plant or I just got to smell it
[02:24:35.820 --> 02:24:37.980]  because that was her stuff.
[02:24:39.140 --> 02:24:42.820]  I always thought the train wreck was Afghan into,
[02:24:42.820 --> 02:24:45.540]  I wanna say something along the haze,
[02:24:45.540 --> 02:24:47.300]  but not exactly a haze.
[02:24:47.300 --> 02:24:50.340]  But that's when I was researching what was the background
[02:24:50.340 --> 02:24:54.140]  of the cookie wreck I put into the hardcore.
[02:24:54.980 --> 02:24:59.980]  I was understanding that there was some Afghan in there
[02:25:01.020 --> 02:25:02.900]  and some sativa.
[02:25:02.900 --> 02:25:04.900]  And of course, just like cat piss,
[02:25:04.900 --> 02:25:08.580]  there's all sorts of name pathways to where every person-
[02:25:08.580 --> 02:25:09.420]  Here we go.
[02:25:09.420 --> 02:25:10.700]  Got what they got.
[02:25:10.700 --> 02:25:12.700]  And they're all true with the cat piss.
[02:25:13.980 --> 02:25:14.820]  Go ahead.
[02:25:15.740 --> 02:25:16.580]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:25:16.580 --> 02:25:18.900]  I remember growing up playing train wreck myself,
[02:25:18.900 --> 02:25:21.700]  but I was pretty secluded and not here to play.
[02:25:21.700 --> 02:25:22.540]  Yeah.
[02:25:24.820 --> 02:25:27.100]  That was something that showed up
[02:25:27.100 --> 02:25:29.940]  after I lifted my head out of the hole in the ground here
[02:25:29.940 --> 02:25:32.580]  and started trading around with folks
[02:25:32.580 --> 02:25:34.780]  to get my base genetics started again.
[02:25:37.300 --> 02:25:40.900]  What I was saying was the cat piss, they're all correct.
[02:25:40.900 --> 02:25:43.900]  Like one guy made a line that he called cat piss.
[02:25:43.900 --> 02:25:46.700]  Me and James all smoked the same shit
[02:25:46.700 --> 02:25:47.740]  from what it sounds like,
[02:25:47.740 --> 02:25:51.100]  the long spindly fucking light green shit
[02:25:51.100 --> 02:25:53.180]  that smelled like piss and chlorine tablets
[02:25:53.180 --> 02:25:54.140]  going up your nose.
[02:25:55.100 --> 02:25:56.620]  Like I smoked that shit all through high school.
[02:25:56.620 --> 02:25:57.580]  It was devastating.
[02:25:57.580 --> 02:25:59.100]  It was some of the best weed.
[02:25:59.100 --> 02:26:01.580]  There was no one ever willing to give up a cut.
[02:26:01.580 --> 02:26:02.860]  When I talk about cuts to them,
[02:26:02.860 --> 02:26:04.780]  they just act like you weren't asking questions
[02:26:04.780 --> 02:26:06.060]  to them and shit.
[02:26:06.060 --> 02:26:08.420]  Like I used to buy it from this one fucking hippie dude
[02:26:08.420 --> 02:26:10.820]  that looked like Garth from Wayne's World.
[02:26:10.820 --> 02:26:12.380]  I bought it from him for years.
[02:26:12.380 --> 02:26:13.220]  He had a briefcase.
[02:26:13.220 --> 02:26:15.300]  He carried cat piss and fucking pills in.
[02:26:15.300 --> 02:26:16.940]  He traded cat piss for any pills
[02:26:16.940 --> 02:26:18.620]  or any amount of money you had.
[02:26:18.620 --> 02:26:19.740]  That's what he was doing.
[02:26:19.740 --> 02:26:20.700]  And all through high school,
[02:26:20.700 --> 02:26:22.500]  we'd go to his fucking apartment.
[02:26:22.540 --> 02:26:25.420]  I'd take cash and get me fucking cat piss
[02:26:25.420 --> 02:26:27.300]  every fucking Friday for the weekend.
[02:26:27.300 --> 02:26:30.180]  So I had cat piss and the fire OG that I was growing
[02:26:30.180 --> 02:26:31.020]  and my grape wreck.
[02:26:31.020 --> 02:26:31.860]  Those were the three lines
[02:26:31.860 --> 02:26:33.620]  that I carried around in high school.
[02:26:33.620 --> 02:26:35.140]  I carried a quarter pound of weed,
[02:26:35.140 --> 02:26:37.540]  two ounces of fire OG,
[02:26:37.540 --> 02:26:39.340]  an ounce of grape wreck and an ounce of cat piss.
[02:26:39.340 --> 02:26:42.100]  I had that shit in my drawers all the fucking time.
[02:26:42.100 --> 02:26:43.660]  I was getting fucking high.
[02:26:43.660 --> 02:26:45.100]  That's just what I knew.
[02:26:45.100 --> 02:26:48.100]  And before that, I was always smoking Afghanis shit
[02:26:48.100 --> 02:26:50.820]  in the eighties before we got busted in 88.
[02:26:50.820 --> 02:26:53.940]  I was smoking a Landrace Afghani that I know.
[02:26:53.940 --> 02:26:56.580]  They were a very broad leaf,
[02:26:56.580 --> 02:26:58.140]  but they all had different structures.
[02:26:58.140 --> 02:26:59.860]  Some were very short plants
[02:26:59.860 --> 02:27:02.740]  and some could get pretty fucking big,
[02:27:02.740 --> 02:27:05.740]  but they were all very hash dominant.
[02:27:07.020 --> 02:27:08.900]  Some of them would be very sour.
[02:27:08.900 --> 02:27:10.500]  There would be some sweet cuts.
[02:27:10.500 --> 02:27:12.220]  What you got going there, brother?
[02:27:12.220 --> 02:27:15.100]  Oh, this is some purple PCK that I got.
[02:27:15.100 --> 02:27:16.580]  The PCK.
[02:27:16.580 --> 02:27:18.900]  Are you finding a lot of irrigation in that thing?
[02:27:19.700 --> 02:27:21.860]  Or any kind of a mutation on the leaf?
[02:27:21.860 --> 02:27:24.300]  Like as it goes out of clone into veg
[02:27:24.300 --> 02:27:25.780]  and start speeding up growth?
[02:27:27.820 --> 02:27:30.860]  There was some mutations in the,
[02:27:30.860 --> 02:27:31.740]  when I first got this,
[02:27:31.740 --> 02:27:33.940]  the guy that read it like six generations,
[02:27:33.940 --> 02:27:35.540]  like I thought I had that out.
[02:27:35.540 --> 02:27:39.020]  And there was like pencil leaf narrow in the male,
[02:27:39.020 --> 02:27:41.580]  some of the males just wouldn't put off any pollen.
[02:27:42.900 --> 02:27:46.820]  I'm not really seeing it now four more generations into it.
[02:27:46.820 --> 02:27:48.980]  I know, I think you got ahold of some of that seed
[02:27:48.980 --> 02:27:53.060]  that came from a couple of generations out from me.
[02:27:53.060 --> 02:27:53.900]  Screw some of you.
[02:27:53.900 --> 02:27:55.140]  Well, I did get some of those,
[02:27:55.140 --> 02:27:57.060]  but I also used the cannabiogen.
[02:27:57.060 --> 02:27:58.780]  I did them next to each other.
[02:27:58.780 --> 02:28:01.460]  I crossed mine to a cannabiogen selection,
[02:28:01.460 --> 02:28:02.580]  my Redwood Cush.
[02:28:02.580 --> 02:28:05.180]  And out of that came these fucking leaves
[02:28:05.180 --> 02:28:07.460]  that look like saw blades.
[02:28:07.460 --> 02:28:10.660]  They're fucking, they're thin as hell.
[02:28:10.660 --> 02:28:14.540]  I mean, they're like a man, a quarter inch wide
[02:28:14.540 --> 02:28:18.900]  and the serrations on them are fucking like a half inch long
[02:28:18.900 --> 02:28:22.100]  that plant looks like blades that come out of that cross.
[02:28:22.100 --> 02:28:26.340]  It also did that with my, with the ghost of poor Royale.
[02:28:26.340 --> 02:28:28.380]  So I did two crosses with the same mother
[02:28:28.380 --> 02:28:30.380]  and I'm getting F1s that pop out of that
[02:28:30.380 --> 02:28:32.340]  that are showing that same expression.
[02:28:32.340 --> 02:28:35.740]  But the mom myself that I used, she doesn't show that,
[02:28:35.740 --> 02:28:38.220]  but she does show a variegation.
[02:28:38.220 --> 02:28:40.860]  She'll like half the leaves will turn white
[02:28:40.860 --> 02:28:42.500]  on different times of growth.
[02:28:42.500 --> 02:28:45.740]  So when she starts to speed up growth out of clone,
[02:28:45.740 --> 02:28:47.540]  she has, goes through a amino slip
[02:28:47.540 --> 02:28:51.620]  and starts to need to have a higher amount of amino acids.
[02:28:51.620 --> 02:28:54.020]  Some of the leaves just completely will turn white
[02:28:54.020 --> 02:28:57.060]  on one side of the leaf and they'll start to twist.
[02:28:57.060 --> 02:28:59.900]  I haven't had any of that kind of variegation,
[02:28:59.900 --> 02:29:02.820]  but if you've seen what I'm calling my Zac-istani Cush,
[02:29:02.820 --> 02:29:05.340]  I get stuff where it's a fuchsia purple
[02:29:05.340 --> 02:29:06.540]  on the bottom side of the leaf
[02:29:06.540 --> 02:29:09.020]  and a bright green on top of the leaf.
[02:29:09.020 --> 02:29:11.340]  That's a pretty cool thing.
[02:29:11.700 --> 02:29:15.260]  The flowers go through this fuchsia orange
[02:29:15.260 --> 02:29:19.220]  and yellow flame at the beginning to a dark, dark purple,
[02:29:19.220 --> 02:29:21.020]  or some of them are almost a blue at the beginning
[02:29:21.020 --> 02:29:25.140]  and finish with that orange and fuchsia flame.
[02:29:25.140 --> 02:29:29.620]  It's a pretty cool little sidetrack I've inbred.
[02:29:29.620 --> 02:29:33.260]  And it's got some pretty good potency too
[02:29:33.260 --> 02:29:36.260]  that the reds and purples don't tend to keep.
[02:29:36.260 --> 02:29:39.340]  It's a fun thing to mess around with,
[02:29:39.340 --> 02:29:42.500]  to get a base genetic or even just as itself.
[02:29:43.540 --> 02:29:45.580]  What makes a Cush a Cush?
[02:29:45.580 --> 02:29:47.100]  I'm reading the comments, I'm sorry.
[02:29:47.100 --> 02:29:48.940]  What makes a Cush a Cush?
[02:29:48.940 --> 02:29:50.740]  What makes a Cush a Cush?
[02:29:50.740 --> 02:29:52.580]  There's different things that can make Cush a Cush,
[02:29:52.580 --> 02:29:54.460]  but a Cush, a true Cush should come
[02:29:54.460 --> 02:29:57.460]  from the Cush Mountain Range in Afghanistan.
[02:29:57.460 --> 02:30:00.500]  That's what a true land-raised Cush would be.
[02:30:00.500 --> 02:30:04.620]  It's not Afghanis, it's a Afghani from the Cush region.
[02:30:04.620 --> 02:30:06.620]  So that's what makes a Cush a Cush.
[02:30:06.660 --> 02:30:09.460]  But when you get into commercial cannabis,
[02:30:09.460 --> 02:30:11.780]  what makes Cush a Cush is whatever the fuck
[02:30:11.780 --> 02:30:14.100]  you guys will buy with the word Cush after it.
[02:30:15.540 --> 02:30:16.380]  That's why I said it's two different things.
[02:30:16.380 --> 02:30:18.860]  A lot of Afghanis just got called Cush
[02:30:18.860 --> 02:30:20.740]  for a couple of reasons.
[02:30:20.740 --> 02:30:25.200]  The highland areas that make up the Hindu Cush region,
[02:30:26.160 --> 02:30:28.460]  all rivers kind of flow down from there.
[02:30:28.460 --> 02:30:31.900]  And so in just the way people generalize stuff
[02:30:31.900 --> 02:30:33.600]  and put things into boxes,
[02:30:33.600 --> 02:30:36.380]  we just ended up calling a lot of the Northern Afghan
[02:30:37.140 --> 02:30:38.020]  stuff got called Cush.
[02:30:38.020 --> 02:30:40.260]  And also a lot of that stuff did derive originally
[02:30:40.260 --> 02:30:44.540]  from those high alpine ranges and come spreading out
[02:30:44.540 --> 02:30:45.800]  in all directions there.
[02:30:46.740 --> 02:30:49.900]  So that's really, there's different,
[02:30:52.020 --> 02:30:55.100]  there's different word etymology or study
[02:30:55.100 --> 02:30:57.500]  as to what the word Cush actually means.
[02:30:57.500 --> 02:30:58.340]  And that land-
[02:30:58.340 --> 02:31:00.380]  Yeah, I've heard it means death or kill,
[02:31:00.380 --> 02:31:02.420]  the word breaks down to.
[02:31:02.420 --> 02:31:05.460]  And it has, that's like a 14,000 foot pass
[02:31:05.460 --> 02:31:10.380]  that people would go intercontinental transition
[02:31:10.380 --> 02:31:12.220]  back in the day, thousands of years ago
[02:31:12.220 --> 02:31:14.020]  and whole tribes would get wiped out up there
[02:31:14.020 --> 02:31:15.260]  just by the weather,
[02:31:15.260 --> 02:31:18.980]  moving across from Afghanistan into India
[02:31:18.980 --> 02:31:20.780]  type of movements, right?
[02:31:21.900 --> 02:31:24.060]  And people get confused with the Cush people
[02:31:24.060 --> 02:31:29.060]  of Northern Africa, but that's not the same thing at all.
[02:31:29.100 --> 02:31:33.500]  So don't confuse that with that word.
[02:31:34.500 --> 02:31:36.700]  Yeah, everyone just threw Cush on
[02:31:36.700 --> 02:31:38.180]  cause it sounds cool.
[02:31:38.180 --> 02:31:39.020]  Right?
[02:31:39.020 --> 02:31:42.060]  Yeah, that's how the skunk got put on everything too, right?
[02:31:42.060 --> 02:31:44.300]  As soon as everybody in high school
[02:31:44.300 --> 02:31:47.180]  or in the marketing of that time period
[02:31:47.180 --> 02:31:49.620]  that wants to buy shit starts to decide
[02:31:49.620 --> 02:31:52.140]  they wanna buy the shit that's got that name on it.
[02:31:52.140 --> 02:31:54.100]  Everything starts to get that name on it.
[02:31:54.100 --> 02:31:55.740]  Dispensaries were doing it.
[02:31:55.740 --> 02:31:58.060]  You're fucking guaranteed the dude you were buying
[02:31:58.060 --> 02:31:59.340]  weed out of a microwave from
[02:31:59.340 --> 02:32:00.700]  in the fucking apartment complex
[02:32:00.700 --> 02:32:02.220]  was naming whatever the fuck he had,
[02:32:02.220 --> 02:32:03.820]  whatever you were gonna buy.
[02:32:03.820 --> 02:32:06.340]  So that's why I'm always telling people
[02:32:06.340 --> 02:32:07.820]  if you didn't buy the seeds and grow them,
[02:32:07.820 --> 02:32:09.540]  how do you know what you fucking smoked
[02:32:09.540 --> 02:32:11.420]  or had was actually that back in the day?
[02:32:11.420 --> 02:32:13.340]  Like skunk, there's a lot of weed
[02:32:13.340 --> 02:32:14.860]  that can carry that terpene profile
[02:32:14.860 --> 02:32:16.900]  that were not that seed line.
[02:32:16.900 --> 02:32:20.100]  So you could have got Afghanis that had that line.
[02:32:20.100 --> 02:32:22.540]  There's even hazes that can smell skunky and shit.
[02:32:23.420 --> 02:32:25.460]  I mean, when you make a hybrid,
[02:32:25.460 --> 02:32:27.740]  you can get skunks out of all kinds of different hybrids.
[02:32:27.740 --> 02:32:31.180]  And then people are like, I had skunk, man.
[02:32:31.180 --> 02:32:32.860]  And like, did you buy the seeds and grow them?
[02:32:32.860 --> 02:32:33.940]  And when did you do it?
[02:32:33.940 --> 02:32:36.500]  That's exactly what's happening with that right there.
[02:32:36.500 --> 02:32:37.500]  It's the same type of thing.
[02:32:37.500 --> 02:32:39.820]  Your dealer, whoever it was at that time,
[02:32:39.820 --> 02:32:42.380]  was selling you what you were gonna buy.
[02:32:42.380 --> 02:32:44.180]  You could not prove what was in the jar
[02:32:44.180 --> 02:32:46.980]  came off the plant that actually bared that name.
[02:32:49.500 --> 02:32:50.340]  Unless you're experienced.
[02:32:50.340 --> 02:32:53.260]  I got a question about the PC cave to you guys.
[02:32:53.260 --> 02:32:55.580]  Cause I've played with that stuff a little bit.
[02:32:55.580 --> 02:33:00.580]  And first Toad, you, oh, I'm talking to mama.
[02:33:00.700 --> 02:33:02.660]  Oh, my mom was just telling me
[02:33:02.660 --> 02:33:03.940]  she's about to announce the verdict
[02:33:03.940 --> 02:33:06.020]  on the trial that's happening right now.
[02:33:07.740 --> 02:33:08.900]  Oh.
[02:33:08.900 --> 02:33:09.740]  Oh.
[02:33:10.780 --> 02:33:14.060]  Yeah, that's what she just passed the adult.
[02:33:14.060 --> 02:33:15.460]  The Chauvin trial right now,
[02:33:15.460 --> 02:33:17.460]  they're about to tell everybody if he's guilty
[02:33:17.460 --> 02:33:19.580]  or if he's innocent.
[02:33:19.580 --> 02:33:22.420]  So shit's about to go down, man.
[02:33:22.420 --> 02:33:23.580]  But go ahead, brother.
[02:33:26.380 --> 02:33:27.220]  Yeah, on the PC cave.
[02:33:27.220 --> 02:33:28.580]  I'm listening and watering right now.
[02:33:28.620 --> 02:33:31.420]  So don't mind my odd posture.
[02:33:31.420 --> 02:33:34.740]  Did you successfully find a watering can?
[02:33:35.580 --> 02:33:38.060]  I did no watering, no hand watering cans
[02:33:38.060 --> 02:33:42.060]  at any thrift shop, dollar store, home.
[02:33:44.180 --> 02:33:47.620]  Let's see, I went into Lowe's, I went into Walmart.
[02:33:47.620 --> 02:33:50.940]  And none of the places have a hand watering can
[02:33:50.940 --> 02:33:52.980]  anymore with the little holes on the top.
[02:33:52.980 --> 02:33:57.980]  And it was $10 for a hose-in sprayer.
[02:33:59.060 --> 02:34:02.260]  If you bought it full of Miracle-Gro,
[02:34:02.260 --> 02:34:04.700]  and it was $15 to buy an empty one.
[02:34:04.700 --> 02:34:07.380]  And so I did not buy a hose-in sprayer.
[02:34:07.380 --> 02:34:10.220]  I'm gonna take a milk jug, punch a bunch of holes in it.
[02:34:10.220 --> 02:34:14.060]  And I need to disperse nematodes.
[02:34:14.060 --> 02:34:17.180]  And in order to do that,
[02:34:17.180 --> 02:34:19.740]  you need some sort of watering can device
[02:34:19.740 --> 02:34:21.140]  or hose-in sprayer.
[02:34:21.140 --> 02:34:26.140]  And so I'm just gonna make my own recycle,
[02:34:26.460 --> 02:34:29.380]  do some use and it was like,
[02:34:29.380 --> 02:34:32.180]  can I just spray all that Miracle-Gro on my front lawn?
[02:34:32.180 --> 02:34:33.620]  What do you think?
[02:34:33.620 --> 02:34:35.980]  Yeah, there's like too much pressure going through there.
[02:34:35.980 --> 02:34:38.060]  It'll kill the little bugs, right?
[02:34:38.060 --> 02:34:39.140]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:34:39.140 --> 02:34:43.060]  There's, I was reading, I got it from Nature's Good Guys.
[02:34:43.060 --> 02:34:45.620]  I'm pretty sure they said you set it at a certain setting
[02:34:45.620 --> 02:34:47.420]  and it should be good on the hose-in.
[02:34:47.420 --> 02:34:49.980]  But I'm just gonna, like I said,
[02:34:49.980 --> 02:34:52.380]  punch a bunch of holes in the end of a milk can.
[02:34:52.380 --> 02:34:53.420]  And gallon by gallon,
[02:34:53.500 --> 02:34:56.340]  I've poured them all over my garden and bulk soil zone.
[02:34:57.500 --> 02:35:00.020]  I've, it's been a while since I've noticed,
[02:35:00.020 --> 02:35:03.180]  but I know I had some root-knot nematodes
[02:35:03.180 --> 02:35:04.860]  in my food garden and such.
[02:35:04.860 --> 02:35:09.460]  And I know they help with the fungus gnats and et cetera.
[02:35:09.460 --> 02:35:14.140]  And so put them to work, right?
[02:35:14.140 --> 02:35:16.940]  They're way better than spraying chemicals.
[02:35:16.940 --> 02:35:18.340]  Yeah.
[02:35:18.340 --> 02:35:20.180]  How many generations?
[02:35:20.940 --> 02:35:23.860]  That all depend on what the starting material is,
[02:35:23.860 --> 02:35:25.940]  my friend, how many generations does it take
[02:35:25.940 --> 02:35:28.060]  to lock the riddle jacks into seed form?
[02:35:28.060 --> 02:35:29.580]  So if you're starting with a landrace,
[02:35:29.580 --> 02:35:30.740]  like we all talk about,
[02:35:30.740 --> 02:35:32.460]  or something that's already inbred,
[02:35:32.460 --> 02:35:36.420]  it takes one generation to lock it back in.
[02:35:36.420 --> 02:35:38.300]  If you're taking a polyhybrid plant
[02:35:38.300 --> 02:35:40.060]  that's carrying four different parents
[02:35:40.060 --> 02:35:43.980]  on one side at minimum, and the same on the other side,
[02:35:43.980 --> 02:35:45.700]  depending on what you're trying to lock in
[02:35:45.700 --> 02:35:46.820]  is gonna take a long time.
[02:35:46.860 --> 02:35:51.860]  A cannabis plant has 32,000 gamuts that wants to pass.
[02:35:52.340 --> 02:35:54.620]  These alleles are on each time.
[02:35:54.620 --> 02:35:57.140]  So you're gonna stabilize all 32,000.
[02:35:57.140 --> 02:35:58.300]  What are you trying to stabilize?
[02:35:58.300 --> 02:36:00.780]  Color, smell, structure?
[02:36:00.780 --> 02:36:02.620]  Are you just trying to offer the genetics
[02:36:02.620 --> 02:36:04.860]  that are in the plant and make that available?
[02:36:04.860 --> 02:36:06.940]  I mean, what do you guys really want?
[02:36:06.940 --> 02:36:08.860]  Yeah, we all have different tastes.
[02:36:08.860 --> 02:36:12.500]  Why as me as the breeder,
[02:36:12.500 --> 02:36:15.540]  am I responsible for locking in what you of the grower
[02:36:15.620 --> 02:36:17.380]  are searching for in my line?
[02:36:17.380 --> 02:36:19.140]  Buy enough seeds and look for it.
[02:36:19.140 --> 02:36:22.060]  Don't buy 10, or do your homework
[02:36:22.060 --> 02:36:24.700]  and buy the line that you're actually looking for.
[02:36:24.700 --> 02:36:27.500]  Even if it's from Hardy or the next guy,
[02:36:27.500 --> 02:36:28.540]  don't buy them from me.
[02:36:28.540 --> 02:36:30.020]  Ask me about it if you want.
[02:36:30.020 --> 02:36:32.500]  And if I have the information, I'll tell you,
[02:36:32.500 --> 02:36:34.620]  because that's the kind of dude I am.
[02:36:34.620 --> 02:36:37.260]  If the breeder you're looking for,
[02:36:37.260 --> 02:36:39.780]  such an impact he has because he's looking for the money,
[02:36:39.780 --> 02:36:41.860]  instead of fucking breaking down what you're after.
[02:36:41.860 --> 02:36:43.860]  Like if you hit me up and look for purples
[02:36:43.860 --> 02:36:45.420]  that are auto flowers, I've got other dudes
[02:36:46.260 --> 02:36:47.100]  that I'm gonna send you to talk to.
[02:36:47.100 --> 02:36:48.660]  I don't breed for those.
[02:36:48.660 --> 02:36:52.180]  I have some auto flower seeds that I could rip you off with.
[02:36:52.180 --> 02:36:55.460]  I could name 10 different dudes that have made accounts
[02:36:55.460 --> 02:36:57.580]  to sling you fake bullshit.
[02:36:57.580 --> 02:36:58.980]  The guys you're looking at right now
[02:36:58.980 --> 02:37:00.180]  aren't any of these dudes.
[02:37:00.180 --> 02:37:02.260]  So like, what does it take?
[02:37:02.260 --> 02:37:04.300]  It takes you as a breeder to understand the plant
[02:37:04.300 --> 02:37:07.100]  you're working with and understand what you're after
[02:37:07.100 --> 02:37:09.180]  and to have enough nuts to know that the people
[02:37:09.180 --> 02:37:10.780]  that are gonna buy them from you are gonna say
[02:37:10.780 --> 02:37:12.940]  that you didn't stabilize for what they were looking for
[02:37:12.940 --> 02:37:16.180]  because they didn't do the research for your line.
[02:37:16.180 --> 02:37:17.780]  People are gonna buy my haze for days
[02:37:17.780 --> 02:37:20.500]  and when it shows up and they finish it in 20 weeks
[02:37:20.500 --> 02:37:22.900]  and it doesn't have a hard nug that looks like cookies,
[02:37:22.900 --> 02:37:25.000]  they're gonna be pissed until they smoke it.
[02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:26.260]  I've had dudes hit me up and go,
[02:37:26.260 --> 02:37:31.260]  dude, I wasn't even into the grow.
[02:37:31.300 --> 02:37:33.580]  I was gonna throw the plant out.
[02:37:33.580 --> 02:37:36.020]  It just, it didn't impress me, didn't look correct.
[02:37:36.020 --> 02:37:37.820]  And then I smoked this shit and he's like,
[02:37:37.820 --> 02:37:39.180]  dude, I'm still smoking it.
[02:37:39.420 --> 02:37:42.500]  Right, he did still in his room
[02:37:42.500 --> 02:37:44.700]  because the plant possesses a power
[02:37:44.700 --> 02:37:48.580]  that other plants that he has now don't work for him.
[02:37:48.580 --> 02:37:50.420]  So I have actually.
[02:37:50.420 --> 02:37:52.860]  I always regret when I call something before I smoke it.
[02:37:52.860 --> 02:37:53.700]  Yeah.
[02:37:53.700 --> 02:37:58.260]  I always regret when I call something before I smoke it.
[02:37:58.260 --> 02:37:59.100]  Yeah.
[02:37:59.100 --> 02:38:00.060]  The end it looks.
[02:38:02.620 --> 02:38:04.420]  Sometimes a line is.
[02:38:04.420 --> 02:38:06.340]  That was racing up a little bit.
[02:38:06.340 --> 02:38:08.780]  If you're making a polyhybrid out there, right?
[02:38:09.420 --> 02:38:10.900]  Go ahead and do your funny naming.
[02:38:10.900 --> 02:38:13.300]  If you're trying to do a reproduction of something,
[02:38:13.300 --> 02:38:15.620]  you should be pretty close to what it is.
[02:38:15.620 --> 02:38:19.100]  But if you're after an orange in your line specifically
[02:38:19.100 --> 02:38:20.980]  and you name it orange and then sell the seeds
[02:38:20.980 --> 02:38:23.340]  and they all come tasting out like grapes,
[02:38:23.340 --> 02:38:26.140]  you don't understand your plant
[02:38:26.140 --> 02:38:27.340]  and you didn't understand breeding
[02:38:27.340 --> 02:38:28.860]  or you would have got at least some orange
[02:38:28.860 --> 02:38:29.780]  out of your plant.
[02:38:29.780 --> 02:38:31.660]  Like I know people that have done this
[02:38:32.580 --> 02:38:36.580]  and like they either didn't release the seeds
[02:38:36.580 --> 02:38:37.780]  and told you about it,
[02:38:37.820 --> 02:38:39.860]  which is what a real breeder does
[02:38:39.860 --> 02:38:41.980]  or they sold it to everybody and didn't give a fuck
[02:38:41.980 --> 02:38:45.500]  because it was hype and they could make the money off it.
[02:38:45.500 --> 02:38:48.140]  But I've got, I've made 144 lines with Angel
[02:38:48.140 --> 02:38:49.940]  and I only released 34.
[02:38:49.940 --> 02:38:52.700]  I sold this available document.
[02:38:55.500 --> 02:38:56.340]  There's two.
[02:38:56.340 --> 02:38:57.180]  What was that?
[02:39:00.740 --> 02:39:01.580]  He freeze.
[02:39:01.580 --> 02:39:02.540]  Like a Rosa.
[02:39:02.540 --> 02:39:05.500]  I think he's strayed too far from the wifi.
[02:39:06.860 --> 02:39:07.700]  You get a little far out there.
[02:39:08.380 --> 02:39:10.660]  People release stuff now,
[02:39:10.660 --> 02:39:12.420]  like stuff that they don't want to,
[02:39:12.420 --> 02:39:14.620]  they just keep getting hounded and hounded.
[02:39:14.620 --> 02:39:17.460]  And then, you know, and then it's a guy puts out root beer
[02:39:17.460 --> 02:39:19.060]  that doesn't really want to put out the root beer
[02:39:19.060 --> 02:39:21.260]  cause he doesn't want to hear the bullshit about it.
[02:39:23.940 --> 02:39:26.540]  I mean, that's, that's how this cannabis thing works.
[02:39:26.540 --> 02:39:29.500]  And as we become more legal and we get there,
[02:39:29.500 --> 02:39:33.140]  like the more that you, if you want to be that legal cat,
[02:39:33.140 --> 02:39:34.460]  you have to do that.
[02:39:34.500 --> 02:39:39.500]  You have to brand for what's hype or you have to make hype
[02:39:40.500 --> 02:39:44.220]  or you will not succeed in what's coming.
[02:39:44.220 --> 02:39:48.420]  Once they decide to reschedule cannabis worldwide
[02:39:48.420 --> 02:39:52.220]  through the, there's what's called the UN gas assembly
[02:39:52.220 --> 02:39:57.220]  of 1971 or 61, a whole bunch of countries came together,
[02:39:57.580 --> 02:39:58.860]  made a treaty.
[02:39:58.860 --> 02:40:03.660]  They all signed on to, to dictate the way laws
[02:40:03.700 --> 02:40:06.180]  for these drugs are all being used in our countries.
[02:40:06.180 --> 02:40:09.260]  It's not something that we all voted on here.
[02:40:09.260 --> 02:40:11.780]  Our, it's, we're not in charge of this shit.
[02:40:11.780 --> 02:40:14.860]  And then right now it's about to go up for real.
[02:40:14.860 --> 02:40:15.700]  It's supposed to happen in 2019.
[02:40:15.700 --> 02:40:18.340]  Adam Schumer announced that today, man.
[02:40:19.420 --> 02:40:20.420]  What's that?
[02:40:20.420 --> 02:40:22.820]  Schumer announced that today is that he's going to bring
[02:40:22.820 --> 02:40:24.060]  the Morgue Act up.
[02:40:24.060 --> 02:40:26.060]  They're going to take it to the Senate.
[02:40:26.060 --> 02:40:29.180]  So that's a good 420 present to us.
[02:40:29.180 --> 02:40:30.020]  Yeah, it is.
[02:40:30.020 --> 02:40:32.220]  But like what's, what's coming is they're going to
[02:40:32.220 --> 02:40:34.660]  reschedule cannabis and the way the laws are done
[02:40:34.660 --> 02:40:39.340]  worldwide and, I froze up here.
[02:40:39.340 --> 02:40:40.660]  Can you guys hear me?
[02:40:40.660 --> 02:40:42.460]  Oh, no reschedule, de-schedule.
[02:40:42.460 --> 02:40:43.620]  I don't want to hear that.
[02:40:43.620 --> 02:40:45.540]  I know that they always change the laws,
[02:40:45.540 --> 02:40:48.540]  but I really hope that they don't change that, man.
[02:40:48.540 --> 02:40:49.380]  Cause rescheduling.
[02:40:49.380 --> 02:40:51.100]  They're going to change it everywhere.
[02:40:51.100 --> 02:40:52.380]  Patents come into effect.
[02:40:52.380 --> 02:40:54.260]  I need to refresh.
[02:40:54.260 --> 02:40:55.540]  We can hear you.
[02:40:56.500 --> 02:40:57.340]  Yeah.
[02:40:59.700 --> 02:41:00.540]  One second.
[02:41:01.140 --> 02:41:01.980]  Whoop, whoop.
[02:41:01.980 --> 02:41:03.980]  But I've read that Morgue Act the entire thing
[02:41:03.980 --> 02:41:06.100]  and I don't want it touched.
[02:41:06.100 --> 02:41:07.900]  It is perfect the way it is.
[02:41:07.900 --> 02:41:08.940]  It's beautiful.
[02:41:08.940 --> 02:41:11.140]  It makes it tomatoes.
[02:41:11.140 --> 02:41:13.100]  You know, it really does.
[02:41:13.100 --> 02:41:15.020]  But I know that they're going to fuck with it somehow.
[02:41:15.020 --> 02:41:16.660]  Let's just hope not too bad.
[02:41:16.660 --> 02:41:17.900]  What do you think Hardy, man?
[02:41:17.900 --> 02:41:20.100]  I know you got some thoughts on this shit.
[02:41:20.100 --> 02:41:21.140]  I've been saying this for years.
[02:41:21.140 --> 02:41:24.140]  We got to wait for this to come up and go.
[02:41:24.140 --> 02:41:29.140]  So the UN has already had a declassification
[02:41:31.460 --> 02:41:34.300]  of cannabis from a dangerous narcotic
[02:41:34.300 --> 02:41:37.300]  to like this ain't no big deal.
[02:41:37.300 --> 02:41:40.060]  But we still have this treaty that we're waiting on
[02:41:40.060 --> 02:41:42.540]  that has to come to expiration.
[02:41:42.540 --> 02:41:47.180]  And yeah, it was either 68 or 74 or something in there.
[02:41:47.180 --> 02:41:48.220]  But it was definitely, you know,
[02:41:48.220 --> 02:41:52.020]  as a result of Nixon coming through after
[02:41:52.020 --> 02:41:54.100]  and doing his yellow paper and realizing like
[02:41:54.100 --> 02:41:56.420]  how awesome cannabis really is.
[02:41:56.420 --> 02:41:57.380]  And they're like, no, no, no, no.
[02:41:57.380 --> 02:41:58.500]  We got to shove this through,
[02:41:58.500 --> 02:42:01.220]  make it totally illegal internationally.
[02:42:01.220 --> 02:42:05.380]  And that's when it all really started
[02:42:05.380 --> 02:42:06.780]  to come down heavy hammer.
[02:42:08.300 --> 02:42:11.020]  So yeah, and the whole world's going opposite
[02:42:11.020 --> 02:42:11.860]  of that at this point.
[02:42:11.860 --> 02:42:16.860]  So I honestly don't even pay a whole lot of attention to it.
[02:42:19.620 --> 02:42:20.460]  There you go.
[02:42:20.460 --> 02:42:21.780]  It's like people ask me,
[02:42:21.780 --> 02:42:23.180]  is it going to be a big fire season this year?
[02:42:23.180 --> 02:42:25.940]  And it's like, yeah, probably.
[02:42:25.940 --> 02:42:27.660]  But like, I don't fight fire anymore.
[02:42:27.660 --> 02:42:31.180]  And you know, I've been freedom fighting so long.
[02:42:31.180 --> 02:42:32.740]  It's like, it's the same.
[02:42:32.740 --> 02:42:34.660]  It's not going to change a whole lot
[02:42:34.660 --> 02:42:37.980]  of what happens here in Utah, right?
[02:42:37.980 --> 02:42:40.300]  We still going to have people having a fire
[02:42:40.300 --> 02:42:42.780]  sort of be able to grow their tomatoes here
[02:42:42.780 --> 02:42:44.260]  just because of the way it is.
[02:42:46.540 --> 02:42:47.380]  Quite a while.
[02:42:51.910 --> 02:42:54.310]  And beer in a grocery store.
[02:42:55.310 --> 02:42:56.150]  Hello.
[02:42:56.150 --> 02:42:59.430]  You might be now walking out to the sea.
[02:42:59.430 --> 02:43:00.270]  Yeah.
[02:43:01.790 --> 02:43:02.630]  Yeah.
[02:43:04.790 --> 02:43:05.630]  It's coming.
[02:43:05.630 --> 02:43:06.470]  That's for sure.
[02:43:06.470 --> 02:43:09.030]  And once it does, what are we going to have?
[02:43:10.910 --> 02:43:14.910]  You hear different people from the old school
[02:43:14.910 --> 02:43:17.790]  talking about guys who are my seniors
[02:43:17.790 --> 02:43:21.550]  talking about the ship loads of cannabis
[02:43:21.590 --> 02:43:24.670]  that used to come in and to the port
[02:43:24.670 --> 02:43:28.190]  in whether if you were up in Maine
[02:43:28.190 --> 02:43:30.990]  or if you were somewhere in California
[02:43:30.990 --> 02:43:35.710]  and NorCal actually had pirate ports forever, right?
[02:43:35.710 --> 02:43:39.950]  And Minnesotans always had these ports
[02:43:39.950 --> 02:43:42.910]  where they brought in stuff.
[02:43:42.910 --> 02:43:47.550]  And it's going to be legal to bring in ship loads.
[02:43:47.550 --> 02:43:49.990]  And there's already countries that are producing
[02:43:49.990 --> 02:43:51.830]  for export and preparing.
[02:43:51.830 --> 02:43:55.150]  I know Thailand's got a national product thing going
[02:43:55.150 --> 02:43:57.990]  and there's some African countries
[02:43:57.990 --> 02:43:58.910]  that are doing the same thing.
[02:43:58.910 --> 02:44:00.950]  So we're actually going to get some true land race
[02:44:00.950 --> 02:44:05.590]  in its original drone location.
[02:44:05.590 --> 02:44:07.270]  Once this stuff all turns around
[02:44:07.270 --> 02:44:12.270]  and legalizes for the whole world.
[02:44:15.110 --> 02:44:16.270]  Then we're going to have,
[02:44:16.270 --> 02:44:19.550]  I think we'll have a cultural tourism, right?
[02:44:19.990 --> 02:44:21.910]  There's already some of that going on here
[02:44:21.910 --> 02:44:22.950]  in the States, right?
[02:44:25.190 --> 02:44:27.510]  But you think about it,
[02:44:27.510 --> 02:44:30.590]  we can start going and really open that kind of
[02:44:30.590 --> 02:44:32.550]  the old hippie trail back up
[02:44:32.550 --> 02:44:35.910]  as a means of local economy enhancement
[02:44:35.910 --> 02:44:40.390]  for people showing off their culture and products.
[02:44:41.390 --> 02:44:43.110]  Yeah, India is my dream.
[02:44:43.110 --> 02:44:47.310]  India just it's sounds lovely.
[02:44:47.750 --> 02:44:51.270]  North to South, South to North is how I'd like to do it.
[02:44:52.710 --> 02:44:54.670]  There's so many places to visit.
[02:44:54.670 --> 02:44:59.670]  It's which one first I'm waiting on my daughter.
[02:44:59.710 --> 02:45:04.710]  She's 16 and a half now and a couple more years.
[02:45:05.590 --> 02:45:08.790]  I'm going to be where you can be off doing her thing
[02:45:08.790 --> 02:45:11.430]  and I don't need to hang out here no more.
[02:45:11.430 --> 02:45:15.510]  And I'm going to be taking a break from sitting still.
[02:45:18.150 --> 02:45:19.870]  I was doing the math.
[02:45:19.870 --> 02:45:21.750]  I just started pulling tarps
[02:45:21.750 --> 02:45:24.710]  and I get that's going to be four months,
[02:45:24.710 --> 02:45:26.150]  not going anywhere.
[02:45:28.990 --> 02:45:31.670]  I got bubble hash and I've got some distillate
[02:45:31.670 --> 02:45:35.590]  that an outdoor mix that I had made last year.
[02:45:36.790 --> 02:45:38.030]  That's what I'm dabbing on.
[02:45:38.030 --> 02:45:39.710]  I didn't mean to interrupt.
[02:45:39.710 --> 02:45:41.030]  You guys put the question.
[02:45:42.870 --> 02:45:45.510]  Someone asked, beautiful extract.
[02:45:45.510 --> 02:45:46.350]  This camera.
[02:45:47.350 --> 02:45:49.590]  Yeah, what you're talking about is what I do.
[02:45:50.830 --> 02:45:53.710]  Harvey, is that mainly what you do is just land races
[02:45:53.710 --> 02:45:55.150]  and just focus on?
[02:45:56.910 --> 02:46:01.870]  So from land race, I don't like just grabbing
[02:46:01.870 --> 02:46:04.230]  other people's stuff and hybridizing it.
[02:46:04.230 --> 02:46:07.710]  That's all swell and awesome for people who do that.
[02:46:07.710 --> 02:46:10.950]  But my kick has always been working
[02:46:10.950 --> 02:46:13.750]  with more of a base land race
[02:46:13.750 --> 02:46:18.750]  and or taking strains or whatever I ended up getting
[02:46:19.190 --> 02:46:21.030]  with that name on it on the seed
[02:46:21.030 --> 02:46:25.710]  and crossing that back to a land race for various purposes.
[02:46:25.710 --> 02:46:30.710]  But bringing it back into more of a rudimentary state
[02:46:31.430 --> 02:46:35.870]  things that we might think of in the early nineties.
[02:46:35.870 --> 02:46:38.390]  As far as it's really all this stuff is
[02:46:38.390 --> 02:46:39.550]  is a bunch of land races.
[02:46:39.550 --> 02:46:42.590]  Yeah, polyhybridized, polyhybridized, polyhybridized.
[02:46:42.590 --> 02:46:43.430]  And so.
[02:46:44.350 --> 02:46:45.190]  Very true.
[02:46:49.550 --> 02:46:53.870]  Yeah, a lot of, like in breeding we know.
[02:46:53.870 --> 02:46:56.310]  We got it, it's at filial feel.
[02:46:58.270 --> 02:46:59.990]  Somebody asked.
[02:46:59.990 --> 02:47:02.470]  It's really easy to outbreed certain things.
[02:47:02.470 --> 02:47:04.750]  Like I heard someone talking recently
[02:47:04.750 --> 02:47:09.150]  about like why some plants get attacked by aphids more.
[02:47:09.150 --> 02:47:09.990]  Right?
[02:47:10.870 --> 02:47:13.510]  And that's because certain defense mechanisms
[02:47:13.510 --> 02:47:15.350]  got bred out of it more than likely.
[02:47:15.350 --> 02:47:16.190]  Okay.
[02:47:16.190 --> 02:47:18.110]  It could be that just in your garden
[02:47:18.110 --> 02:47:19.630]  they're getting more than nitrogen,
[02:47:19.630 --> 02:47:23.670]  but or whatever it is that's attracting those aphids.
[02:47:23.670 --> 02:47:26.150]  But just like I'll tell the story before
[02:47:26.150 --> 02:47:30.950]  and I'll tell it again about the Monterey pine R22 trees
[02:47:30.950 --> 02:47:34.670]  that we've all seen in the Lord of the Rings series movies.
[02:47:34.670 --> 02:47:36.750]  All the dead trees where they bred
[02:47:36.750 --> 02:47:38.190]  that particular forest tree
[02:47:38.190 --> 02:47:43.190]  for extremely fast growth, turnover of lumber,
[02:47:43.350 --> 02:47:46.630]  but they completely bred out all defense mechanisms
[02:47:46.630 --> 02:47:47.870]  of disease and insects.
[02:47:47.870 --> 02:47:48.830]  Right?
[02:47:48.830 --> 02:47:51.070]  And so that's always just been one of my core things
[02:47:51.070 --> 02:47:55.150]  with whatever I'm doing is knocking it back
[02:47:55.150 --> 02:47:59.990]  to that original breed,
[02:47:59.990 --> 02:48:04.630]  kind of like breeding a sled dog up in Alaska
[02:48:04.630 --> 02:48:07.510]  back to the wolf to strengthen its genetics.
[02:48:07.510 --> 02:48:11.030]  And that's the kind of concept that I've always worked with.
[02:48:11.030 --> 02:48:13.910]  And that's been the niche I focus on.
[02:48:13.910 --> 02:48:16.990]  And for the first time ever recently,
[02:48:16.990 --> 02:48:19.470]  Clone Fairy brought a bunch of modern clones
[02:48:19.470 --> 02:48:21.390]  and it's neat to compare.
[02:48:21.390 --> 02:48:23.990]  It's like, Hey, this is some, you know,
[02:48:23.990 --> 02:48:27.350]  actually grows out pretty strong.
[02:48:27.350 --> 02:48:30.670]  And some of mine compare right there next to all these.
[02:48:30.670 --> 02:48:33.470]  So it's, I know when you get,
[02:48:34.470 --> 02:48:35.630]  you know, those elite cuts,
[02:48:35.630 --> 02:48:38.550]  those are coming from thousands and thousands of seeds.
[02:48:38.550 --> 02:48:41.550]  And I kind of pop thousands of seeds a year
[02:48:41.550 --> 02:48:44.830]  and I can't keep all these cuts I come up with.
[02:48:44.830 --> 02:48:47.830]  But I think I'm right in there as far as the numbers go.
[02:48:47.830 --> 02:48:49.390]  You're not always going to hit a winner.
[02:48:49.390 --> 02:48:52.070]  And Mr. Clone says that as well.
[02:48:52.070 --> 02:48:54.830]  There's, and I try to be open with that
[02:48:54.830 --> 02:48:58.430]  when what you're looking for.
[02:48:58.430 --> 02:49:00.710]  A lot of times I'm not even trying to breed something
[02:49:00.710 --> 02:49:03.950]  back into, there's so many awesome things
[02:49:03.950 --> 02:49:06.150]  when you open it back up to that land race.
[02:49:06.150 --> 02:49:08.950]  It's like, take a look at this
[02:49:08.950 --> 02:49:11.870]  and see what you find that fits you, right?
[02:49:11.870 --> 02:49:13.790]  So there's some of that going on.
[02:49:15.110 --> 02:49:18.070]  And then like, I've got my Dr. Dream Alt cure
[02:49:18.070 --> 02:49:20.230]  and it literally was like the one surviving cut
[02:49:20.230 --> 02:49:21.750]  that came out of all the pressures
[02:49:21.750 --> 02:49:24.630]  that came down upon me over time here.
[02:49:24.630 --> 02:49:27.670]  And before I realized I had my first amendment rights
[02:49:27.670 --> 02:49:29.070]  and started expressing that.
[02:49:30.030 --> 02:49:31.430]  And that's just like, it's kind of a,
[02:49:31.430 --> 02:49:34.510]  it's a polyhybrid of land race primarily.
[02:49:35.670 --> 02:49:37.710]  And so like I got in my head,
[02:49:37.710 --> 02:49:39.390]  I'm just going to start back crossing this
[02:49:39.390 --> 02:49:42.350]  to different land races and creating these land race
[02:49:42.350 --> 02:49:46.310]  OG hybrid killer killers.
[02:49:46.310 --> 02:49:50.110]  And so that's what all the Breath of the Dragon series is.
[02:49:50.110 --> 02:49:53.590]  My brother had a Hindu Kush for 10 years
[02:49:53.590 --> 02:49:57.150]  that got passed to me and my mentor spent 30 years
[02:49:57.150 --> 02:50:02.150]  breeding 26 land races, 22 land races over 26 years together.
[02:50:02.310 --> 02:50:04.030]  And he handed his life's project to me
[02:50:04.030 --> 02:50:05.990]  after the feds busted him, shut him down.
[02:50:05.990 --> 02:50:10.150]  He had one pack of seeds left and I crossed those together.
[02:50:10.150 --> 02:50:14.390]  And then eventually in 2008,
[02:50:14.390 --> 02:50:18.430]  that got crossed to the original San Fernando Valley cut.
[02:50:18.430 --> 02:50:21.150]  And that was the last, and one seed made it out of that.
[02:50:21.150 --> 02:50:23.550]  And so I've been basing everything out of that
[02:50:23.550 --> 02:50:24.470]  and land race.
[02:50:25.470 --> 02:50:28.630]  Land race preservation, land race hybridization
[02:50:28.630 --> 02:50:33.630]  and strengthening of various cuts.
[02:50:33.750 --> 02:50:36.070]  If there's something I can see I can improve.
[02:50:38.190 --> 02:50:40.270]  Do you see that question?
[02:50:40.270 --> 02:50:41.390]  Breath of the Red Dragon,
[02:50:41.390 --> 02:50:43.270]  how much is expected to stretch after slipping?
[02:50:43.270 --> 02:50:44.790]  How much would you, okay.
[02:50:44.790 --> 02:50:46.750]  So I'm going to hide back out to the greenhouse
[02:50:46.750 --> 02:50:50.670]  and I'm going to show you guys some of this right now.
[02:50:50.710 --> 02:50:55.710]  And this is pretty amazing for a sativa type of OG thing.
[02:50:56.830 --> 02:51:00.670]  It doesn't really, and I've just pruned some out
[02:51:00.670 --> 02:51:02.110]  to flip and tarp here.
[02:51:02.110 --> 02:51:06.310]  And hopefully I don't keep chopping out here.
[02:51:06.310 --> 02:51:07.470]  The other is there's fan noise.
[02:51:07.470 --> 02:51:08.830]  I'm going to ditch some of the fan noise
[02:51:08.830 --> 02:51:10.070]  as soon as I get in there.
[02:51:12.550 --> 02:51:14.630]  So there's variables, right?
[02:51:14.630 --> 02:51:17.190]  You're getting an F2 right now.
[02:51:17.190 --> 02:51:19.590]  If you're picking those up, you're going to have,
[02:51:19.590 --> 02:51:21.390]  there's going to be some that might stretch a little more,
[02:51:21.390 --> 02:51:26.390]  but the number 13 that I use for all of the reversal
[02:51:27.990 --> 02:51:31.270]  and Peter Scott and one I've been sending out to folks.
[02:51:31.270 --> 02:51:35.190]  I like to get spread out to people is this one right here.
[02:51:37.990 --> 02:51:38.830]  Nice.
[02:51:39.830 --> 02:51:40.670]  What is that?
[02:51:40.670 --> 02:51:44.350]  There is, this is my Breath of Red Dragon number 13.
[02:51:44.350 --> 02:51:49.150]  This is the, let's see, here we go.
[02:51:49.150 --> 02:51:49.990]  Yeah.
[02:51:51.590 --> 02:51:52.430]  All right.
[02:51:52.430 --> 02:51:55.030]  So, you know, I didn't, I pulled a few,
[02:51:57.710 --> 02:51:59.750]  didn't really lollipop it, right?
[02:52:00.870 --> 02:52:02.550]  Just pulled a couple of nodes at the bottom
[02:52:02.550 --> 02:52:05.510]  on a couple of these, but for the most part, that's,
[02:52:06.790 --> 02:52:08.550]  and then we'll compare it here.
[02:52:08.550 --> 02:52:12.590]  Here's Dr. Dream All Cure.
[02:52:12.590 --> 02:52:16.990]  You can see it's a narrower, not quite as chunky.
[02:52:16.990 --> 02:52:18.670]  And I got a lollipop at a lot more
[02:52:19.190 --> 02:52:23.150]  to get it to actually not be all fanned out.
[02:52:23.150 --> 02:52:23.990]  Right?
[02:52:23.990 --> 02:52:30.970]  So it's supposed to, like, here's,
[02:52:32.050 --> 02:52:36.650]  this one is the Chocolate Tie Acapulco Gold.
[02:52:37.570 --> 02:52:38.410]  All right.
[02:52:38.410 --> 02:52:41.130]  And it got the 48 hour and dark before split.
[02:52:41.130 --> 02:52:43.410]  Keep it from stretching as well.
[02:52:43.410 --> 02:52:47.170]  And I picked some of those out that don't stretch so much,
[02:52:48.010 --> 02:52:53.010]  but the Nigerian doesn't tend to stretch.
[02:52:53.210 --> 02:52:54.490]  It just can get huge.
[02:52:55.650 --> 02:53:00.650]  And so it's not like some of the other tropical sativas
[02:53:02.610 --> 02:53:05.090]  that really, really stretch in my experience.
[02:53:05.090 --> 02:53:07.650]  Even the few times I really brought it indoors,
[02:53:07.650 --> 02:53:11.130]  I haven't had, in the first selection, I had a few of them.
[02:53:11.130 --> 02:53:14.090]  And even doing open pollination,
[02:53:14.090 --> 02:53:15.930]  we all have our own tendencies
[02:53:15.970 --> 02:53:18.850]  as to which, where we select towards, right?
[02:53:18.850 --> 02:53:23.570]  And so my stuff tends to be just that stockier
[02:53:25.370 --> 02:53:27.890]  type of stature.
[02:53:27.890 --> 02:53:31.570]  But again, Farmer Phil, he managed to take that
[02:53:31.570 --> 02:53:36.170]  and produce a 20, 23 foot tall tree
[02:53:36.170 --> 02:53:38.370]  in his backyard there in the Bay Area.
[02:53:38.370 --> 02:53:39.370]  Nice.
[02:53:39.370 --> 02:53:43.370]  So from seed, I don't think he pre-planted or nothing, but.
[02:53:43.370 --> 02:53:48.370]  And this is obviously at a younger stage,
[02:53:48.690 --> 02:53:51.810]  but this is the Breath of Red Dragon 13.
[02:53:51.810 --> 02:53:54.050]  Yeah, so if you put it right there,
[02:53:54.050 --> 02:53:55.370]  it's not gonna stretch so much,
[02:53:55.370 --> 02:53:59.730]  but it's gonna more than double, almost triple the size.
[02:53:59.730 --> 02:54:03.290]  And just cola that whole thing out donkey, right?
[02:54:03.290 --> 02:54:07.490]  So it does like a lot of light on the end.
[02:54:07.490 --> 02:54:10.050]  I did find that the lollipop in it
[02:54:10.050 --> 02:54:12.290]  tends to help get a more of a dense,
[02:54:12.290 --> 02:54:15.090]  and you're gonna get a dense cola end
[02:54:15.090 --> 02:54:18.570]  and a lot of good hash material
[02:54:18.570 --> 02:54:20.450]  on a long branch behind that.
[02:54:20.450 --> 02:54:22.770]  And depending on how long, if you let it go huge,
[02:54:22.770 --> 02:54:24.010]  of course, you're gonna,
[02:54:24.010 --> 02:54:25.570]  the bigger it gets, the more that happens.
[02:54:25.570 --> 02:54:26.650]  If you're growing it indoor,
[02:54:26.650 --> 02:54:28.090]  you should be able to produce something
[02:54:28.090 --> 02:54:32.410]  that's not gonna blow your lids off, so to speak,
[02:54:33.850 --> 02:54:35.570]  that we all wanna avoid indoors.
[02:54:35.570 --> 02:54:37.290]  Well, I was trying to comment earlier,
[02:54:37.290 --> 02:54:38.290]  you guys were talking the haze
[02:54:38.290 --> 02:54:39.730]  and keeping scratch down and stuff.
[02:54:39.730 --> 02:54:41.210]  And there's things I like to do
[02:54:41.210 --> 02:54:44.330]  and I do find those long, like a chelowothy,
[02:54:44.330 --> 02:54:46.450]  I've not put out like the brown dragon yet.
[02:54:46.450 --> 02:54:48.450]  And some of these other ones that I've crossed,
[02:54:48.450 --> 02:54:50.850]  it takes so much time to do the work.
[02:54:52.250 --> 02:54:56.930]  But like more blue light than red light in your system,
[02:54:56.930 --> 02:54:59.410]  you can manipulate and keep those internodes shorter.
[02:54:59.410 --> 02:55:01.730]  That 24 hour darkness before you flip
[02:55:01.730 --> 02:55:04.770]  can help with your sativas from stretching.
[02:55:04.770 --> 02:55:09.490]  And what was the, you know, I just,
[02:55:09.530 --> 02:55:11.930]  if you pinch, if they start going
[02:55:11.930 --> 02:55:13.850]  and you don't wanna bust your colas off,
[02:55:13.850 --> 02:55:17.890]  you can pinch 90 degrees from which way you wanna fold it.
[02:55:17.890 --> 02:55:19.370]  And you break and crush that stem
[02:55:19.370 --> 02:55:20.970]  instead of it actually breaking.
[02:55:22.170 --> 02:55:25.650]  You can fold it over
[02:55:25.650 --> 02:55:29.170]  and increase your roof space again that way.
[02:55:29.170 --> 02:55:31.570]  It also makes those buds a little thicker too
[02:55:31.570 --> 02:55:34.610]  after you pinch them like that and they start to heal up.
[02:55:34.610 --> 02:55:36.890]  Those, I think past that pinch point
[02:55:36.890 --> 02:55:40.410]  has a little bit more girth and the stems are stronger.
[02:55:40.410 --> 02:55:42.970]  So that's a great tip for people right there.
[02:55:44.370 --> 02:55:45.210]  Yeah, I do.
[02:55:45.210 --> 02:55:46.970]  And when I'm manipulating plants,
[02:55:46.970 --> 02:55:48.810]  I do a lot of crushing the stem
[02:55:48.810 --> 02:55:53.810]  and you keep a roll of plumbers tape,
[02:55:54.130 --> 02:55:56.210]  the stuff that you feel your threads with, right?
[02:55:56.210 --> 02:55:57.770]  The plumbers dope tape.
[02:55:57.770 --> 02:55:59.970]  That's the thing because it's the best tape.
[02:56:00.890 --> 02:56:02.610]  You get it wrapped around twice.
[02:56:02.610 --> 02:56:04.850]  That stuff stretches, you pull it tight,
[02:56:04.850 --> 02:56:06.250]  it sticks to itself.
[02:56:06.250 --> 02:56:08.810]  And as the plant grows, it doesn't restrict the growth.
[02:56:08.810 --> 02:56:11.850]  It allows that callous to just keep expanding
[02:56:11.850 --> 02:56:13.530]  and grow around with a lot of the tape
[02:56:13.530 --> 02:56:15.970]  that can restrict your growth.
[02:56:15.970 --> 02:56:20.330]  I find that's definitely the best mode of safety mechanism
[02:56:20.330 --> 02:56:21.850]  for breaking stems and training
[02:56:21.850 --> 02:56:24.530]  when you're scrogging or thogging.
[02:56:24.530 --> 02:56:26.890]  I never thought of it for that.
[02:56:26.890 --> 02:56:29.410]  I used to use it when I was grafting cannabis.
[02:56:29.410 --> 02:56:32.250]  I never thought of using it for the training plant.
[02:56:32.250 --> 02:56:33.290]  That's fucking killer.
[02:56:33.290 --> 02:56:35.930]  But I did used to use it for wrapping the stem
[02:56:35.930 --> 02:56:38.690]  when I put the new section into the plant
[02:56:38.690 --> 02:56:40.730]  when I was grafting one strain to the other.
[02:56:40.730 --> 02:56:43.450]  But I'm fucking, that's stupid to not think.
[02:56:43.450 --> 02:56:44.290]  See?
[02:56:44.290 --> 02:56:46.170]  Grafting though, man.
[02:56:46.170 --> 02:56:48.610]  That's a whole nother, like you're grafting.
[02:56:48.610 --> 02:56:49.450]  Come on.
[02:56:49.450 --> 02:56:51.970]  Oh yeah, well, I was trying to sell clones in my club
[02:56:51.970 --> 02:56:54.250]  to the patients that we could only have,
[02:56:54.250 --> 02:56:56.730]  at one point they could only have 12 plants.
[02:56:56.730 --> 02:56:58.970]  And then they went from 12 to 99 the next year.
[02:56:58.970 --> 02:57:02.490]  But like, so I'm thinking if I could offer the patients
[02:57:02.490 --> 02:57:05.290]  six plants that each plant had six strains on it,
[02:57:05.290 --> 02:57:08.490]  then they'd have 36 different types of cannabis
[02:57:08.490 --> 02:57:09.330]  they could smoke.
[02:57:09.330 --> 02:57:11.650]  And it was a way around the fucking law
[02:57:11.650 --> 02:57:14.730]  of only having six plants in your backyard in flower.
[02:57:14.730 --> 02:57:15.890]  And then they moved us to 12.
[02:57:15.890 --> 02:57:17.970]  Like my city was doing all kinds of shit
[02:57:17.970 --> 02:57:20.850]  to try to keep people from going and using cannabis.
[02:57:20.850 --> 02:57:23.710]  So the way I had, I'm running the club.
[02:57:23.710 --> 02:57:25.370]  I got to come up with fucking,
[02:57:25.370 --> 02:57:26.770]  like I'm the clone guy and everything.
[02:57:26.770 --> 02:57:28.410]  So that's what my idea was.
[02:57:28.410 --> 02:57:31.570]  So I started making moms that had six different
[02:57:32.570 --> 02:57:34.130]  strains on it, the original one.
[02:57:34.130 --> 02:57:36.050]  And then five new ones grafted to it.
[02:57:36.050 --> 02:57:37.370]  And then the person could take that
[02:57:37.370 --> 02:57:38.690]  and grow that in their garden.
[02:57:38.690 --> 02:57:40.410]  But they switched it on me,
[02:57:40.410 --> 02:57:42.930]  right as I was about to start dropping those on people.
[02:57:42.930 --> 02:57:45.730]  And they were able to go to 99 plants.
[02:57:45.730 --> 02:57:46.570]  And I'm like, well, fuck,
[02:57:46.570 --> 02:57:49.930]  I can't do 99 of these motherfuckers all the time.
[02:57:49.930 --> 02:57:51.890]  I can do 12 for certain people.
[02:57:51.890 --> 02:57:53.370]  Cause like.
[02:57:53.370 --> 02:57:55.290]  Did you do it like the apple tree guys
[02:57:55.290 --> 02:57:56.890]  and like select for the rootstock,
[02:57:56.890 --> 02:57:59.690]  like find a plant that had like that really hardy rootstock?
[02:57:59.690 --> 02:58:00.530]  Yeah, man.
[02:58:00.530 --> 02:58:01.370]  That's exactly what I was doing.
[02:58:01.810 --> 02:58:03.050]  Awesome.
[02:58:03.050 --> 02:58:04.850]  That's exactly what I was trying to do.
[02:58:04.850 --> 02:58:06.770]  So like, well, with my strain,
[02:58:06.770 --> 02:58:08.970]  I was trying to do a space Cush version.
[02:58:08.970 --> 02:58:09.810]  And then from that,
[02:58:09.810 --> 02:58:11.810]  I also was trying to do one that was based on,
[02:58:11.810 --> 02:58:14.410]  I was using a blue dream that I had that thing rooted,
[02:58:14.410 --> 02:58:16.370]  like a champion man.
[02:58:16.370 --> 02:58:18.330]  And my Hayes rooted like a champion.
[02:58:18.330 --> 02:58:21.690]  So I was able to, I could, I could graft to them,
[02:58:21.690 --> 02:58:24.050]  but like once I got them to the people,
[02:58:24.050 --> 02:58:26.930]  they still wanted to only pay $10 for like a three foot
[02:58:26.930 --> 02:58:30.370]  plant that's got six different strains on it.
[02:58:30.370 --> 02:58:32.330]  It took so much work to make it.
[02:58:32.330 --> 02:58:34.050]  I'm like, man, I can't keep up.
[02:58:34.050 --> 02:58:35.610]  Like just take six plants, bro.
[02:58:35.610 --> 02:58:38.010]  Here, you guys can have six plants, right?
[02:58:38.010 --> 02:58:41.530]  So I was doing 4,400 clones.
[02:58:41.530 --> 02:58:44.170]  I was doing 4,400 clones a month for the shop.
[02:58:44.170 --> 02:58:47.410]  And then trying to do these custom fucking mother clones
[02:58:47.410 --> 02:58:49.090]  that I was hoping people would take
[02:58:49.090 --> 02:58:52.490]  and then either grow fully out or take cuttings off of that
[02:58:52.490 --> 02:58:54.890]  and have a smart enough idea to think,
[02:58:54.890 --> 02:58:57.850]  well, now I can have whatever strain I want,
[02:58:57.850 --> 02:58:58.690]  whenever I need them.
[02:58:58.730 --> 02:59:00.850]  Like they could learn how to do clone orders
[02:59:00.850 --> 02:59:02.410]  by getting this mom and this,
[02:59:02.410 --> 02:59:05.130]  like get them all growing at the same pace
[02:59:05.130 --> 02:59:07.770]  and start taking all the cuts you need to make new moms.
[02:59:07.770 --> 02:59:08.610]  Get around it.
[02:59:10.690 --> 02:59:11.530]  People just didn't get into it.
[02:59:11.530 --> 02:59:13.250]  That's brilliant, man.
[02:59:13.250 --> 02:59:18.170]  Cloning, I tried doing onto some hops a couple of times.
[02:59:18.170 --> 02:59:19.770]  I got a bunch of hops growing.
[02:59:19.770 --> 02:59:23.410]  But that's, the cloning here,
[02:59:23.410 --> 02:59:26.330]  even fruit trees and nuts and stuff is really hard
[02:59:26.370 --> 02:59:27.490]  just because it's so dry.
[02:59:27.490 --> 02:59:31.690]  As soon as we come out of cold, it's not cold anymore.
[02:59:31.690 --> 02:59:32.530]  It's hot and dry.
[02:59:32.530 --> 02:59:33.370]  Yep.
[02:59:36.810 --> 02:59:38.130]  Trying to do that with, man,
[02:59:38.130 --> 02:59:40.450]  I was always trying to keep ahead of all the laws here, man.
[02:59:40.450 --> 02:59:43.650]  So 215 used to make people stay on their toes
[02:59:43.650 --> 02:59:45.770]  and shit to offer the patients
[02:59:45.770 --> 02:59:48.010]  what the law was allowing them and shit.
[02:59:48.010 --> 02:59:51.610]  So it wasn't driven by the patient's hype.
[02:59:51.610 --> 02:59:53.730]  It was driven by the city's ordinances,
[02:59:53.730 --> 02:59:55.490]  everywhere I knew about at that time.
[02:59:55.490 --> 02:59:57.050]  So whatever the city was doing,
[02:59:57.050 --> 02:59:58.890]  we tried to get them to stop.
[02:59:58.890 --> 03:00:01.530]  The cops couldn't fuck with you during 215.
[03:00:01.530 --> 03:00:03.370]  The way the law was written is you could get away
[03:00:03.370 --> 03:00:06.770]  with pretty much anything with getting recouped
[03:00:06.770 --> 03:00:09.490]  at whatever it took to make whatever you were passing
[03:00:09.490 --> 03:00:11.610]  to someone, be it herbs, clones,
[03:00:11.610 --> 03:00:13.850]  or an edible or something, right?
[03:00:13.850 --> 03:00:16.170]  The law was written so you can reimburse the person
[03:00:16.170 --> 03:00:18.290]  you got it from, patient to patient.
[03:00:18.290 --> 03:00:20.570]  So as long as you could keep up with the laws
[03:00:20.570 --> 03:00:22.290]  that they wanted in packaging,
[03:00:22.330 --> 03:00:26.410]  or at one point they wanted us to deliver the clones
[03:00:26.410 --> 03:00:29.450]  in boxes in the middle of parking lots and shit,
[03:00:29.450 --> 03:00:31.330]  random places in town.
[03:00:31.330 --> 03:00:33.890]  We couldn't do it at our store.
[03:00:33.890 --> 03:00:35.770]  So we're like, well, what the fuck are we supposed to do?
[03:00:35.770 --> 03:00:39.810]  They're like, well, they wanted us to go to Kmart
[03:00:39.810 --> 03:00:41.370]  and shit and do it in their parking lot.
[03:00:41.370 --> 03:00:42.810]  And I'm like, that's a fucking felony, man.
[03:00:42.810 --> 03:00:44.810]  What are you fucking talking about?
[03:00:44.810 --> 03:00:47.850]  Oh, dude, they were having city this shit.
[03:00:47.850 --> 03:00:50.370]  And I'm from my club and I'm the only dude
[03:00:50.370 --> 03:00:53.050]  out of 27 clubs that's bringing up like laws and shit.
[03:00:53.050 --> 03:00:55.930]  I'm speaking fucking ordinances to them and shit.
[03:00:55.930 --> 03:00:58.810]  They wanted our patients to show up once a month
[03:00:58.810 --> 03:01:01.970]  and buy whatever their script said
[03:01:01.970 --> 03:01:03.170]  they were supposed to have.
[03:01:03.170 --> 03:01:05.290]  And our city, they made the doctors write down
[03:01:05.290 --> 03:01:09.370]  an amount of cannabis that each patient was supposed
[03:01:09.370 --> 03:01:12.010]  to have based on whatever sickness they had,
[03:01:12.010 --> 03:01:14.130]  or whatever their doctor was willing to put on there.
[03:01:14.130 --> 03:01:17.530]  So some people had doctors that would put 9999,
[03:01:17.530 --> 03:01:20.250]  which meant endless and you were a dying patient.
[03:01:21.130 --> 03:01:22.170]  So they were like, fuck it and put it on everybody.
[03:01:22.170 --> 03:01:24.890]  So you could have an endless amount of any form of cannabis,
[03:01:24.890 --> 03:01:27.890]  be it clones, hash, herb.
[03:01:27.890 --> 03:01:29.450]  Like if you knew the law and the ordinance,
[03:01:29.450 --> 03:01:30.530]  you could get around this shit,
[03:01:30.530 --> 03:01:31.890]  but most people were so high,
[03:01:31.890 --> 03:01:33.490]  they wouldn't take time to read it.
[03:01:33.490 --> 03:01:34.530]  And it was my job.
[03:01:34.530 --> 03:01:37.010]  So I was learning what the fuck to do.
[03:01:37.010 --> 03:01:38.930]  So when they started putting this on us,
[03:01:38.930 --> 03:01:41.890]  first they started with FBI background checks for us.
[03:01:41.890 --> 03:01:46.890]  And luckily the dude on shift that day was me.
[03:01:47.090 --> 03:01:49.010]  So they send me down to represent the club
[03:01:49.010 --> 03:01:50.010]  and I pass everything.
[03:01:50.010 --> 03:01:52.050]  Cause I ain't been in trouble with weed.
[03:01:52.050 --> 03:01:53.690]  Like I've been cool with her,
[03:01:53.690 --> 03:01:56.050]  but my family's been busted by myself.
[03:01:56.050 --> 03:01:56.970]  I ain't got in trouble.
[03:01:56.970 --> 03:01:58.450]  So I passed the test.
[03:01:58.450 --> 03:02:00.130]  Then they start doing the clone shit.
[03:02:00.130 --> 03:02:02.450]  So we're delivering clones in parking lots
[03:02:02.450 --> 03:02:03.290]  and shit randomly.
[03:02:03.290 --> 03:02:04.570]  So what we did is start doing it
[03:02:04.570 --> 03:02:06.250]  in front of the police station
[03:02:06.250 --> 03:02:08.930]  and use their own ordinance against them.
[03:02:08.930 --> 03:02:12.170]  Like you told us that we had to do this shit.
[03:02:12.170 --> 03:02:14.570]  So we're gonna do it where it's the safest place in town.
[03:02:14.570 --> 03:02:16.730]  And that's in front of your fucking parking lot.
[03:02:16.730 --> 03:02:18.810]  Cause there was a blank parking lot next to it.
[03:02:19.610 --> 03:02:20.610]  And we're right there fucking delivering herb.
[03:02:20.610 --> 03:02:22.890]  Like there's ways to battle these motherfuckers
[03:02:22.890 --> 03:02:25.970]  with their own shit and just don't be a dick about it.
[03:02:25.970 --> 03:02:28.250]  So eventually we did everything.
[03:02:28.250 --> 03:02:30.310]  We had to pay for a 24 hour surveillance
[03:02:30.310 --> 03:02:31.530]  when we weren't even open.
[03:02:31.530 --> 03:02:32.930]  We had to have a fucking dude driving
[03:02:32.930 --> 03:02:35.010]  in our parking lot and shit.
[03:02:35.010 --> 03:02:36.730]  So eventually we tried to offer
[03:02:37.730 --> 03:02:40.610]  to pay for two brand new police officers
[03:02:40.610 --> 03:02:42.410]  for them to hire, to do whatever they wanted.
[03:02:42.410 --> 03:02:44.170]  And they were like, what the fuck?
[03:02:44.170 --> 03:02:45.530]  And they were like, we don't take drug money.
[03:02:45.530 --> 03:02:46.970]  And we're like, well, it's not drug money, man.
[03:02:46.970 --> 03:02:47.810]  It's illegal.
[03:02:47.810 --> 03:02:48.850]  We just want to be safe.
[03:02:48.850 --> 03:02:50.210]  We want everyone else to be safe.
[03:02:50.210 --> 03:02:52.250]  So hire them to patrol around a school
[03:02:52.250 --> 03:02:55.250]  or around our business, whatever it takes, man.
[03:02:55.250 --> 03:02:56.530]  They wouldn't take us up on that.
[03:02:56.530 --> 03:03:00.850]  We tried to put in a system where every patient got a number
[03:03:00.850 --> 03:03:04.290]  but their name and nothing was attached to it.
[03:03:04.290 --> 03:03:06.610]  None of their medical history, just at the fact
[03:03:06.610 --> 03:03:08.170]  that they were a legal cannabis patient
[03:03:08.170 --> 03:03:10.370]  in California and in our County.
[03:03:10.370 --> 03:03:13.090]  And we would send that database updated every 30 days
[03:03:13.090 --> 03:03:14.770]  to the police station if they needed it
[03:03:14.770 --> 03:03:16.050]  with a number system.
[03:03:16.090 --> 03:03:18.250]  So they could see that we got new members
[03:03:18.250 --> 03:03:19.930]  because they wanted to know who was buying what
[03:03:19.930 --> 03:03:21.370]  at what place and how much.
[03:03:21.370 --> 03:03:23.450]  And we're like, well, we can tell you the dude
[03:03:23.450 --> 03:03:24.570]  bought an ounce at that store.
[03:03:24.570 --> 03:03:26.490]  And then came to ours and bought an ounce.
[03:03:26.490 --> 03:03:30.050]  Like we don't know if there's a discrepancy.
[03:03:30.050 --> 03:03:31.530]  We're just offering the cannabis to them.
[03:03:31.530 --> 03:03:33.050]  You guys want to know, here you go.
[03:03:33.050 --> 03:03:36.850]  Patient 77, he bought three ounces this month
[03:03:36.850 --> 03:03:39.450]  but you told him to go to the doctor.
[03:03:39.450 --> 03:03:41.770]  And the doctor says that dude can have an endless amount
[03:03:41.770 --> 03:03:42.690]  of cannabis this month.
[03:03:42.690 --> 03:03:45.370]  And you want him to come buy that at my club
[03:03:45.370 --> 03:03:46.930]  on one day a month, right?
[03:03:46.930 --> 03:03:48.570]  So I said, now he's driving down the interstate
[03:03:48.570 --> 03:03:51.370]  to go back home and he's committed a felony
[03:03:51.370 --> 03:03:53.730]  because the federal law says that he cannot drive
[03:03:53.730 --> 03:03:55.930]  down the highway with that amount of cannabis.
[03:03:55.930 --> 03:03:57.770]  You pull him over, he's going to jail
[03:03:57.770 --> 03:03:59.770]  or because your city ordinance told me
[03:03:59.770 --> 03:04:01.850]  to break a federal law.
[03:04:01.850 --> 03:04:03.330]  I said, that's not happening here.
[03:04:03.330 --> 03:04:05.450]  And eventually he kicked me out of the fucking
[03:04:05.450 --> 03:04:07.730]  the city meetings and shit.
[03:04:07.730 --> 03:04:09.090]  They wouldn't even let me in there.
[03:04:09.090 --> 03:04:11.050]  So then they took all the patients
[03:04:11.050 --> 03:04:11.930]  and wouldn't let them in there.
[03:04:11.930 --> 03:04:14.650]  Cause other dudes started trying to do what I was doing
[03:04:14.650 --> 03:04:16.410]  but because they had just started
[03:04:16.410 --> 03:04:18.670]  they didn't have enough information to fight
[03:04:18.670 --> 03:04:20.810]  with the city lawyers about what they were trying to put
[03:04:20.810 --> 03:04:22.650]  on our fucking patients.
[03:04:22.650 --> 03:04:25.810]  And eventually they just fucking caved in
[03:04:25.810 --> 03:04:28.730]  and they started sending the police that were getting scripts
[03:04:28.730 --> 03:04:30.730]  and the sheriffs to our shop and shit
[03:04:30.730 --> 03:04:33.150]  because no matter what we were going to fucking follow
[03:04:33.150 --> 03:04:37.290]  every law because bro, we're getting to offer cannabis
[03:04:37.290 --> 03:04:38.410]  legally to patients.
[03:04:38.410 --> 03:04:39.250]  You guys are tripping.
[03:04:39.250 --> 03:04:41.290]  We don't have to be at the apartment no more
[03:04:41.290 --> 03:04:44.090]  stashed in a microwave and shit or in our shoe.
[03:04:44.530 --> 03:04:46.090]  We ain't got to go behind some school
[03:04:46.090 --> 03:04:48.490]  and offer somebody some herb where it looks
[03:04:48.490 --> 03:04:50.290]  like some dude that's 50s buying weed
[03:04:50.290 --> 03:04:52.090]  from some dude that's fucking 18.
[03:04:52.090 --> 03:04:55.610]  I bought my first cancer medicine from Mafia on the street.
[03:04:55.610 --> 03:04:56.450]  Yeah.
[03:04:56.450 --> 03:04:58.290]  I literally was on the streets.
[03:04:58.290 --> 03:05:01.290]  It was like gang mafia on the streets of Los Angeles.
[03:05:01.290 --> 03:05:04.650]  It was the first time I was asked to buy cancer medicine
[03:05:04.650 --> 03:05:05.930]  in the mid eighties.
[03:05:05.930 --> 03:05:08.670]  The only place I knew to go, like, I know I can get this.
[03:05:08.670 --> 03:05:10.890]  This woman's hurting from,
[03:05:10.890 --> 03:05:12.690]  we weren't healing people all the way then.
[03:05:12.690 --> 03:05:15.890]  We were just helping them with their chemotherapy.
[03:05:15.890 --> 03:05:17.570]  So they didn't feel like death rolled over.
[03:05:17.570 --> 03:05:20.250]  They felt like, oh, God loves me.
[03:05:20.250 --> 03:05:21.070]  Right.
[03:05:21.070 --> 03:05:25.090]  And I'm healing and I can eat and wow.
[03:05:25.090 --> 03:05:27.210]  Can you roll me another one?
[03:05:27.210 --> 03:05:29.210]  And it was, it was brick weed.
[03:05:29.210 --> 03:05:32.090]  It was the sexy maxi is all I could get for her at the time.
[03:05:32.090 --> 03:05:35.570]  But it was literally, I had to buy from street mafia
[03:05:35.570 --> 03:05:37.170]  to get medicine.
[03:05:37.170 --> 03:05:40.130]  The first time I bought it at the age of 15 for somebody.
[03:05:40.130 --> 03:05:45.130]  Well, that was 10 years before you could first provide it
[03:05:46.930 --> 03:05:49.330]  legally through a club.
[03:05:51.010 --> 03:05:52.850]  What's the strangest thing you ever found
[03:05:52.850 --> 03:05:54.610]  in that maxi brick, man?
[03:05:54.610 --> 03:05:57.490]  You just find like plastic bags and like window screen
[03:05:57.490 --> 03:05:58.730]  and all this other shit in there.
[03:05:58.730 --> 03:06:00.830]  You start breaking one of those things up.
[03:06:00.830 --> 03:06:01.670]  Yeah.
[03:06:04.250 --> 03:06:07.970]  I never remember finding much more than like a grasshopper
[03:06:07.970 --> 03:06:09.490]  or something like that.
[03:06:10.370 --> 03:06:13.930]  Oh, my buddy's dad used to fucking take,
[03:06:13.930 --> 03:06:16.610]  he used to fucking move shit down in Palm Springs
[03:06:16.610 --> 03:06:17.450]  and shit, right?
[03:06:17.450 --> 03:06:18.270]  We'd go over to his house.
[03:06:18.270 --> 03:06:22.370]  He had fucking 55 gallons, hefty bags,
[03:06:22.370 --> 03:06:23.990]  full of pressed herb, right?
[03:06:23.990 --> 03:06:26.450]  We found talk of trucks in that shit.
[03:06:26.450 --> 03:06:28.970]  I used to find fucking roaches.
[03:06:28.970 --> 03:06:31.490]  I found fucking scissors and shit.
[03:06:31.490 --> 03:06:34.330]  I've found so much shit in fucking pressed max, man.
[03:06:34.330 --> 03:06:36.410]  It's crazy what my buddies,
[03:06:37.410 --> 03:06:39.750]  every corner of his house, he had bags of that shit.
[03:06:40.390 --> 03:06:41.230]  It was like, it was nothing.
[03:06:41.230 --> 03:06:42.550]  We'd come over there and he'd take,
[03:06:42.550 --> 03:06:44.510]  he'd ask for some herb.
[03:06:44.510 --> 03:06:48.270]  He'd grab a loaf of bread, like a Wonder Bread loaf or shit.
[03:06:48.270 --> 03:06:50.750]  He'd dump all the fucking bread in the trash
[03:06:50.750 --> 03:06:52.990]  and tell us, fill the bag up and take what we wanted.
[03:06:52.990 --> 03:06:55.710]  So we'd be in there shoving fucking pressed mix
[03:06:55.710 --> 03:06:57.630]  and fucking Wonder loaf bags.
[03:06:57.630 --> 03:06:59.150]  Dude, it was our wonder weed, dude.
[03:06:59.150 --> 03:07:01.350]  We'd be fucking hopping all over the desert,
[03:07:01.350 --> 03:07:02.970]  highs, fucking shit, dude.
[03:07:02.970 --> 03:07:05.230]  Smoking fucking Paraquats pressed,
[03:07:05.230 --> 03:07:07.990]  fucking cannabis full of seeds and shit, dude.
[03:07:07.990 --> 03:07:09.790]  It would take longer to pull the seeds and stems
[03:07:09.790 --> 03:07:12.510]  out of this shit than it did to smoke the fucking joint
[03:07:12.510 --> 03:07:13.350]  and roll it, man.
[03:07:13.350 --> 03:07:14.430]  We'd be like, what the fuck?
[03:07:14.430 --> 03:07:16.190]  You chain smoking that shit, dude.
[03:07:16.190 --> 03:07:17.850]  You're high as fuck, but like,
[03:07:17.850 --> 03:07:19.630]  you gotta do so much work, dude.
[03:07:19.630 --> 03:07:21.990]  By the time you fucking realize you're too fucking high,
[03:07:21.990 --> 03:07:23.710]  you smoked the whole Wonder Bread bag
[03:07:23.710 --> 03:07:25.310]  of fucking pressed max.
[03:07:25.310 --> 03:07:27.550]  You don't wanna go in there and shit, dude.
[03:07:27.550 --> 03:07:30.310]  Kids were like, you gotta take all the seeds and stems out.
[03:07:30.310 --> 03:07:32.350]  And if my big brother was like,
[03:07:32.350 --> 03:07:35.030]  if one paper tears from a stem you left in it,
[03:07:35.030 --> 03:07:35.870]  I'm beating you.
[03:07:38.710 --> 03:07:43.270]  That's the, so back, you know, wealthy kids,
[03:07:43.270 --> 03:07:46.510]  we were like growing up in Newport Beach, Southern Cal,
[03:07:46.510 --> 03:07:48.670]  and trying to find like, where can we get some?
[03:07:48.670 --> 03:07:49.590]  Where can we get some?
[03:07:49.590 --> 03:07:53.110]  And we would go into Santa Ana
[03:07:53.110 --> 03:07:55.150]  and there's some not so wholesome neighborhoods.
[03:07:55.150 --> 03:07:57.390]  And like, there would be like a street
[03:07:57.390 --> 03:07:59.630]  and you had to make sure you got the right house
[03:07:59.630 --> 03:08:00.470]  because the wrong house,
[03:08:00.470 --> 03:08:02.390]  they were selling something you didn't want.
[03:08:02.390 --> 03:08:05.070]  And it was literally iron bars.
[03:08:05.110 --> 03:08:08.870]  And there's a little hole through a window or a door.
[03:08:08.870 --> 03:08:10.390]  You could use like the knock,
[03:08:10.390 --> 03:08:13.310]  with the proper knock, just like a sticky type of thing.
[03:08:13.310 --> 03:08:14.350]  And you could see in there,
[03:08:14.350 --> 03:08:17.510]  and there was literally a fucking pile of 20 bags,
[03:08:17.510 --> 03:08:19.670]  which was a quarter ounce of the press weed.
[03:08:20.790 --> 03:08:22.630]  Maybe a thousand of them, right?
[03:08:22.630 --> 03:08:24.510]  And they're just sitting there in a stack
[03:08:24.510 --> 03:08:27.270]  and like, how is this happening?
[03:08:27.270 --> 03:08:29.230]  It's like, well, the guys next door are selling crack
[03:08:29.230 --> 03:08:31.070]  and the guys next door is out of selling heroin.
[03:08:31.070 --> 03:08:33.870]  They don't care about the press weed here at this house.
[03:08:35.430 --> 03:08:37.430]  But man, the worst I ever saw though,
[03:08:37.430 --> 03:08:42.430]  I think is when I went to Costa Rica in about 2010, 2007,
[03:08:44.910 --> 03:08:46.110]  I don't know, somewhere back then.
[03:08:46.110 --> 03:08:51.110]  And I scored some jungle weeds.
[03:08:52.070 --> 03:08:56.310]  It was literally, it was three, four seeds and stems.
[03:08:56.310 --> 03:08:58.870]  When I got down, I bought like a quarter ounce
[03:08:58.870 --> 03:09:01.070]  and there was two or three joints at the bottom of it
[03:09:01.070 --> 03:09:02.350]  after cleaning it.
[03:09:02.350 --> 03:09:04.110]  That was just, wow.
[03:09:06.070 --> 03:09:08.950]  Everyone down there was doing cocaine.
[03:09:08.950 --> 03:09:11.230]  I'm not into that anymore.
[03:09:14.110 --> 03:09:15.270]  We used to call it ranch.
[03:09:15.270 --> 03:09:19.710]  My brother has a crazy, he was in Columbia
[03:09:20.630 --> 03:09:24.790]  and like some guy kept trying,
[03:09:24.790 --> 03:09:27.670]  obviously he sticks out as a,
[03:09:27.670 --> 03:09:29.550]  he's like a six foot four inch,
[03:09:29.550 --> 03:09:31.910]  six foot three inch white guy.
[03:09:31.950 --> 03:09:36.950]  And this guy kept, basically people kept coming up to him,
[03:09:37.110 --> 03:09:38.710]  asking him if he wanted to buy cocaine.
[03:09:38.710 --> 03:09:39.590]  Do you want to buy cocaine?
[03:09:39.590 --> 03:09:40.430]  Like, no, thanks.
[03:09:40.430 --> 03:09:41.270]  No, thanks.
[03:09:41.270 --> 03:09:43.750]  No, like, just like, finally it was like, all right,
[03:09:43.750 --> 03:09:46.190]  if it gets you to leave me alone, sure I'll buy some.
[03:09:46.190 --> 03:09:48.190]  And it was like super cheap.
[03:09:48.190 --> 03:09:52.470]  And literally as soon as,
[03:09:53.630 --> 03:09:55.830]  this was in a bar restaurant, I think.
[03:09:55.830 --> 03:09:59.670]  And as soon as that happened, the cops who were waiting,
[03:09:59.670 --> 03:10:02.030]  it was basically they were waiting to bust him,
[03:10:03.190 --> 03:10:05.230]  came over to his table
[03:10:05.230 --> 03:10:07.350]  and basically they wanted to extort him.
[03:10:07.350 --> 03:10:12.350]  So they were like, it'll be 400 US,
[03:10:12.590 --> 03:10:14.990]  like they put him in the back of their car
[03:10:14.990 --> 03:10:19.990]  and it was like 400 bucks to get out and we'll let you go.
[03:10:21.470 --> 03:10:25.950]  And it was just after the banks had closed.
[03:10:26.070 --> 03:10:29.190]  And so they were like, okay,
[03:10:29.190 --> 03:10:31.430]  we'll bring you back to your hostel,
[03:10:31.430 --> 03:10:32.990]  but don't try to leave
[03:10:32.990 --> 03:10:34.910]  because we're coming back first thing in the morning
[03:10:34.910 --> 03:10:37.070]  to pick you up and bring you back to the bank
[03:10:37.070 --> 03:10:39.470]  so you can pay us our payoff.
[03:10:39.470 --> 03:10:44.470]  And literally they dropped him off at his hostel,
[03:10:46.630 --> 03:10:49.710]  and he took, I think the next bus up to Ecuador
[03:10:49.710 --> 03:10:52.750]  where he basically took it out of the country.
[03:10:52.750 --> 03:10:54.910]  He got the fuck out of Dodge.
[03:10:54.910 --> 03:10:56.510]  But I'd be shitting bricks
[03:10:56.510 --> 03:11:00.670]  if I was pinched in Columbia for cocaine.
[03:11:00.670 --> 03:11:02.070]  Shitting bricks of cocaine.
[03:11:02.070 --> 03:11:03.750]  He's like, oh shit.
[03:11:03.750 --> 03:11:05.910]  Seen in a foreign country and didn't arrest him.
[03:11:05.910 --> 03:11:08.590]  There's nothing fun about it.
[03:11:10.310 --> 03:11:11.790]  You're not a citizen there.
[03:11:11.790 --> 03:11:13.430]  It's a totally different thing.
[03:11:18.990 --> 03:11:21.830]  We all have citizen privilege here to some extent.
[03:11:21.830 --> 03:11:23.870]  I mean, they're saying like the Chauvin case
[03:11:23.870 --> 03:11:27.790]  is being decided today.
[03:11:27.790 --> 03:11:28.630]  Yeah, right now.
[03:11:29.910 --> 03:11:31.230]  As a kid growing up,
[03:11:31.230 --> 03:11:33.310]  I literally, I went to a private high school
[03:11:33.310 --> 03:11:36.270]  and as a freshman, I lived in the town
[03:11:36.270 --> 03:11:39.390]  just east of East LA in the month of bail
[03:11:39.390 --> 03:11:43.710]  during the crack cocaine war between the Crips and Bloods.
[03:11:43.710 --> 03:11:47.350]  So I was a white guy in prep clothes
[03:11:47.350 --> 03:11:50.190]  in a very mixed neighborhood
[03:11:50.190 --> 03:11:53.350]  and moving through these mixed neighborhoods
[03:11:53.870 --> 03:11:58.870]  and talking about feeling the oppression from watching it.
[03:12:00.750 --> 03:12:03.790]  Back then, people were beating cops up too.
[03:12:03.790 --> 03:12:04.790]  We didn't have the video.
[03:12:04.790 --> 03:12:06.870]  We didn't have the communications.
[03:12:06.870 --> 03:12:08.510]  So there's people beating people.
[03:12:08.510 --> 03:12:10.550]  There's people beating cops.
[03:12:10.550 --> 03:12:11.950]  There's cops beating people.
[03:12:13.870 --> 03:12:15.710]  Here I get off the bus with a bunch of weed.
[03:12:15.710 --> 03:12:19.630]  I got off the street and go walk around the park
[03:12:19.630 --> 03:12:22.590]  smoking a joint and stinking like street weed
[03:12:23.110 --> 03:12:24.470]  and that stuff is greasy.
[03:12:24.470 --> 03:12:27.070]  You got reddened stains on your lips and fingers
[03:12:27.910 --> 03:12:32.910]  and walk past the LAPD squad car with a dog in the back
[03:12:33.190 --> 03:12:38.190]  and it goes crazy because I read the weed walking by
[03:12:38.350 --> 03:12:43.310]  and these two officers, one was Hispanic and one was black
[03:12:43.310 --> 03:12:45.110]  and they told the dog to shut up
[03:12:45.110 --> 03:12:47.230]  and leave the white kid alone.
[03:12:47.230 --> 03:12:49.350]  And that's the reality of America.
[03:12:49.350 --> 03:12:50.310]  It kind of sucks.
[03:12:50.350 --> 03:12:53.830]  But when we leave America, we all lose that privilege.
[03:12:55.150 --> 03:12:59.750]  And we think that we have all these entitlements
[03:12:59.750 --> 03:13:02.110]  that we don't, we're just human beings
[03:13:02.110 --> 03:13:03.430]  and unless you can get to a consulate
[03:13:03.430 --> 03:13:05.630]  and you're in a foreign country, you're...
[03:13:06.670 --> 03:13:08.990]  I've said it before, I felt like,
[03:13:08.990 --> 03:13:13.350]  I thought I was that guy in the Midnight Express
[03:13:13.350 --> 03:13:17.390]  when I got arrested in Mexico for a half a gram of cannabis
[03:13:17.390 --> 03:13:19.990]  at the age of 17 in the late 80s.
[03:13:20.670 --> 03:13:21.950]  One of the scarier things,
[03:13:21.950 --> 03:13:24.790]  and I've had wildfire burn me over 80 feet
[03:13:24.790 --> 03:13:27.670]  and literally I've had my ears melting off in a wildfire
[03:13:27.670 --> 03:13:28.790]  and that's just kind of scary.
[03:13:28.790 --> 03:13:30.830]  But here I am like,
[03:13:30.830 --> 03:13:32.430]  one of the bunch of dudes with machine guns on me
[03:13:32.430 --> 03:13:35.710]  for half a gram of weed and I had time to think about it
[03:13:35.710 --> 03:13:37.910]  and realize it's like, they're going, grab your pants,
[03:13:37.910 --> 03:13:38.790]  you don't need shoes,
[03:13:38.790 --> 03:13:41.750]  where's the keys to your mother's vehicle?
[03:13:41.750 --> 03:13:45.910]  We're taking that, we're taking you and away you go.
[03:13:46.430 --> 03:13:47.270]  Fuck that.
[03:13:47.270 --> 03:13:49.150]  No se hable espanol,
[03:13:49.150 --> 03:13:50.910]  there's nothing, yeah.
[03:13:50.910 --> 03:13:53.270]  Doesn't matter, you know, and they will,
[03:13:53.270 --> 03:13:54.830]  they see a white guy, they see an American
[03:13:54.830 --> 03:13:57.030]  and they'll extort you for it.
[03:13:57.030 --> 03:14:00.830]  And luckily my cousin was able to set a report
[03:14:00.830 --> 03:14:02.950]  and it was only $240.
[03:14:02.950 --> 03:14:04.310]  They kept my identification
[03:14:04.310 --> 03:14:06.830]  and then there was a couple of hundred dudes in America
[03:14:06.830 --> 03:14:09.190]  working in the farmlands with my name and my ID.
[03:14:10.830 --> 03:14:12.350]  Like kept getting all these W-2s,
[03:14:12.350 --> 03:14:14.310]  like, no, that's not me, that's not me.
[03:14:16.310 --> 03:14:17.710]  Well, here's the freedom, man.
[03:14:17.710 --> 03:14:19.610]  It's about 420 where I am.
[03:14:19.610 --> 03:14:22.750]  So 420 on 420 right here, bud.
[03:14:22.750 --> 03:14:24.710]  That's what's messed up, man.
[03:14:24.710 --> 03:14:26.990]  They're about to drop that book in Verdict at 420.
[03:14:26.990 --> 03:14:30.110]  A little bit, I was showing you last summer's charcoal
[03:14:30.110 --> 03:14:31.190]  of Dr. Dre Malki.
[03:14:31.190 --> 03:14:32.030]  That's dumb.
[03:14:33.550 --> 03:14:35.670]  I've always said it's not the prettiest thing in the world,
[03:14:35.670 --> 03:14:40.150]  but boy, it sure, it'll kick your butt just right.
[03:14:40.150 --> 03:14:43.150]  You know, there's some people who prefer more sativa
[03:14:43.150 --> 03:14:44.550]  and that doesn't the best thing for them
[03:14:44.550 --> 03:14:45.510]  and more of a couch block
[03:14:45.510 --> 03:14:47.150]  to people who need a straight sativa.
[03:14:47.150 --> 03:14:48.790]  That's why I crossed it in,
[03:14:50.150 --> 03:14:51.070]  in sativa.
[03:14:53.350 --> 03:14:58.350]  So there was a question a while ago, wobbly bobbly.
[03:14:59.070 --> 03:15:02.070]  I crossed a chocolate Minoji and peanut butter breath
[03:15:02.070 --> 03:15:03.670]  ran it the next year and they were fine.
[03:15:03.670 --> 03:15:05.590]  Crossed them last year and this year
[03:15:05.590 --> 03:15:09.630]  half turned out variegated, what happened?
[03:15:09.630 --> 03:15:11.070]  Indoor, outdoor?
[03:15:11.590 --> 03:15:13.790]  It could, indoor there could be an issue
[03:15:13.790 --> 03:15:18.350]  with micro elements and shit.
[03:15:18.350 --> 03:15:21.150]  Instead of you're like you're slipping in iron
[03:15:21.150 --> 03:15:24.330]  and zinc and magnesium along with amino acids.
[03:15:25.910 --> 03:15:29.710]  Outdoors, possibly a bug could have got to them
[03:15:29.710 --> 03:15:30.950]  and vector happened
[03:15:30.950 --> 03:15:33.510]  and that could have caused the variegation,
[03:15:33.510 --> 03:15:36.430]  but you can also get the same output
[03:15:36.430 --> 03:15:38.430]  from what I mentioned.
[03:15:38.430 --> 03:15:41.790]  The micronutrients are off,
[03:15:41.790 --> 03:15:44.910]  like the Kim D does this indoors.
[03:15:44.910 --> 03:15:47.310]  It's really hard to get that Kim D out,
[03:15:48.630 --> 03:15:49.830]  puts on it outdoors.
[03:15:49.830 --> 03:15:52.470]  She almost loses the variegation completely.
[03:15:53.790 --> 03:15:55.710]  It has to do with the micronutrients
[03:15:55.710 --> 03:15:57.950]  and the amino acids that she's producing
[03:15:57.950 --> 03:16:01.350]  which are causing the variegation in her system.
[03:16:03.790 --> 03:16:05.390]  But different plants will do it for different reasons.
[03:16:05.390 --> 03:16:07.310]  Like the PCK does it when it comes out
[03:16:07.310 --> 03:16:10.870]  of a clone and goes into rapid vegetative growth.
[03:16:10.870 --> 03:16:13.630]  It'll start the one I have, not all PCKs
[03:16:13.630 --> 03:16:16.150]  but the mom that I used to create a couple
[03:16:16.150 --> 03:16:17.670]  of the lines that I have.
[03:16:17.670 --> 03:16:22.510]  She'll start to variegate from what I call amino slip.
[03:16:22.510 --> 03:16:26.630]  It's having an issue with processing amino acids.
[03:16:26.630 --> 03:16:29.870]  That's when I use something like Thrive In
[03:16:29.870 --> 03:16:34.870]  or a soybean amino complex like soybean meal on the plant.
[03:16:35.670 --> 03:16:38.470]  It'll help her produce more amino acids
[03:16:38.470 --> 03:16:41.870]  or not produce them, but have them available on the system.
[03:16:42.950 --> 03:16:46.310]  I wanted to ask you all a question about PCK earlier.
[03:16:46.310 --> 03:16:48.830]  Like this, it didn't do this with me
[03:16:48.830 --> 03:16:52.670]  but the effect with me is it would always give me tinnitus
[03:16:52.670 --> 03:16:54.470]  every single plant too.
[03:16:54.470 --> 03:16:56.150]  It made my ears ring.
[03:16:56.150 --> 03:16:57.630]  And of course it's unpleasant
[03:16:57.630 --> 03:16:59.350]  but it didn't do it to other people.
[03:16:59.350 --> 03:17:00.190]  They love to answer.
[03:17:00.190 --> 03:17:02.790]  It's the most beautiful stuff I've ever grown.
[03:17:02.830 --> 03:17:04.990]  It is absolutely amazing.
[03:17:04.990 --> 03:17:09.990]  I'll tell you what, it is really got some potencies to it
[03:17:10.030 --> 03:17:14.790]  in ways it's like, it's not my regular go-to
[03:17:14.790 --> 03:17:16.590]  even when I have large jars of it.
[03:17:18.750 --> 03:17:20.750]  To me, it's got a very strong,
[03:17:22.510 --> 03:17:25.750]  it puts my brain to sleep almost I wanna say.
[03:17:25.750 --> 03:17:27.390]  I think it's an excellent PTSD.
[03:17:28.390 --> 03:17:32.790]  It doesn't couch lock me like something might
[03:17:32.790 --> 03:17:36.590]  but it's like, I just, I'll find myself staring at shit
[03:17:36.590 --> 03:17:39.110]  and like not doing anything, right?
[03:17:39.110 --> 03:17:39.950]  Yeah.
[03:17:39.950 --> 03:17:41.070]  Yeah, that's a day-
[03:17:41.070 --> 03:17:42.910]  Turn into a philosopher all of a sudden.
[03:17:42.910 --> 03:17:45.150]  That's a day tripping shit I talk about, man.
[03:17:45.150 --> 03:17:46.270]  The haze does that to me.
[03:17:46.270 --> 03:17:47.710]  It makes me fucking sit there
[03:17:47.710 --> 03:17:49.430]  and I'm thinking about all kinds of shit,
[03:17:49.430 --> 03:17:52.070]  but like, I don't wanna get up and do none of it.
[03:17:52.070 --> 03:17:54.190]  But everything around me is like, fuck,
[03:17:54.190 --> 03:17:56.910]  I'm alert to everything.
[03:17:57.350 --> 03:18:00.590]  But I'm like, it's tripping, it's trippy shit.
[03:18:00.590 --> 03:18:02.470]  It's like the start of a,
[03:18:02.470 --> 03:18:04.070]  if you've ever took acid or shrooms,
[03:18:04.070 --> 03:18:07.590]  it's like right when the shit hits just very beginning,
[03:18:07.590 --> 03:18:09.950]  that's kind of like the effect I get off of those.
[03:18:09.950 --> 03:18:12.590]  Yeah, it's almost an electric feeling or so.
[03:18:12.590 --> 03:18:14.750]  I don't know, it's like everything is,
[03:18:14.750 --> 03:18:17.990]  every cell's connected, like you're alert to everything.
[03:18:17.990 --> 03:18:20.350]  It's crazy, man.
[03:18:21.470 --> 03:18:26.470]  My mentor insisted that PCK was not a indica
[03:18:26.470 --> 03:18:27.830]  as we all think of it as,
[03:18:27.830 --> 03:18:31.430]  Yanica proper or indica.
[03:18:31.430 --> 03:18:35.550]  He didn't say it was actually a,
[03:18:36.510 --> 03:18:38.750]  so here's someone else who gets tinnitus too.
[03:18:39.950 --> 03:18:40.790]  He didn't call it a tinnitus.
[03:18:40.790 --> 03:18:42.870]  Yeah, I was gonna ask what phenol was it, what color?
[03:18:42.870 --> 03:18:44.790]  That's what I was gonna ask.
[03:18:44.790 --> 03:18:46.750]  I'd never seen a green one.
[03:18:46.750 --> 03:18:49.750]  I went through quite a few of them and I never saw green.
[03:18:49.750 --> 03:18:53.510]  They're all like pink and purple and absolutely beautiful.
[03:18:53.510 --> 03:18:56.470]  And real dark and narrow leaf too, like you were saying.
[03:18:58.150 --> 03:18:59.190]  It's a little bitty thing.
[03:18:59.190 --> 03:19:00.710]  I got it because it's like,
[03:19:02.110 --> 03:19:05.590]  I'm in a similar region to the valley over there.
[03:19:05.590 --> 03:19:08.710]  So it makes sense for me because of like,
[03:19:08.710 --> 03:19:10.230]  right now it's PM season.
[03:19:10.230 --> 03:19:12.390]  Of course, that's not gonna hurt your cannabis,
[03:19:12.390 --> 03:19:14.910]  but it's around.
[03:19:14.910 --> 03:19:17.310]  But right now everything that can get PM,
[03:19:17.310 --> 03:19:20.470]  like the nettles and stuff out there are just covered in it.
[03:19:20.510 --> 03:19:24.750]  And next it's gonna be my Minarda plants, the bee balms.
[03:19:24.750 --> 03:19:26.670]  Like it's almost like that stuff was bred
[03:19:26.670 --> 03:19:29.230]  to attract powdery mildew.
[03:19:29.230 --> 03:19:31.230]  There's only been one light cutting found
[03:19:31.230 --> 03:19:33.950]  that actually like it's called Jacob Klein or something,
[03:19:33.950 --> 03:19:38.150]  that it actually is powdery mildew resistant bee balm.
[03:19:38.150 --> 03:19:42.310]  But they just, so I test plants that way.
[03:19:42.310 --> 03:19:45.390]  So when I got these, yes, they look like PCK.
[03:19:45.390 --> 03:19:46.430]  I got mine from Ace.
[03:19:46.430 --> 03:19:49.070]  You said you got yours from a Cannabiogen Toad?
[03:19:49.070 --> 03:19:52.230]  Yeah, Ace got, Doobie got his from,
[03:19:52.230 --> 03:19:54.030]  I don't know where Hardy got his from,
[03:19:54.030 --> 03:19:56.950]  but like you're talking about Ace and Cannabiogen.
[03:19:56.950 --> 03:19:59.150]  Ace got their stock from Cannabiogen.
[03:19:59.150 --> 03:20:00.870]  Doobie got them from Charlie Garcia.
[03:20:00.870 --> 03:20:03.630]  So depending on the year.
[03:20:03.630 --> 03:20:05.990]  Well, I got it through another hand
[03:20:05.990 --> 03:20:09.310]  who selected it for six generations before I got it.
[03:20:09.310 --> 03:20:11.390]  Yeah, so they're slightly different.
[03:20:11.390 --> 03:20:15.510]  The stuff I got, there's all 60, 40 green purple.
[03:20:15.510 --> 03:20:17.750]  Yeah, I got a lot of green, nice.
[03:20:17.790 --> 03:20:18.630]  More purple.
[03:20:18.630 --> 03:20:20.310]  Same with mine.
[03:20:20.310 --> 03:20:22.750]  Right, in the side track.
[03:20:22.750 --> 03:20:24.910]  So I've got stuff, if you're picking up a pack
[03:20:24.910 --> 03:20:28.630]  from Peter right now, you should get 60, 40 green purple.
[03:20:28.630 --> 03:20:30.790]  If you're getting the stuff that he has in mind.
[03:20:30.790 --> 03:20:33.310]  And then I have some of those.
[03:20:33.310 --> 03:20:37.510]  More homozygous of the purple strains.
[03:20:39.470 --> 03:20:41.350]  Yeah, I have some of both of those.
[03:20:41.350 --> 03:20:43.630]  Yeah, but it truly is mold resistant
[03:20:43.630 --> 03:20:45.630]  because I really put it to the test.
[03:20:45.630 --> 03:20:47.710]  Yeah, I crossed it out to an OG too
[03:20:47.710 --> 03:20:50.030]  and put it out there because they say
[03:20:50.030 --> 03:20:51.990]  that OG likes the mold on you.
[03:20:51.990 --> 03:20:55.230]  So I put that OG cross out there
[03:20:55.230 --> 03:20:56.230]  and it did the same thing.
[03:20:56.230 --> 03:20:57.390]  It was just champion.
[03:20:57.390 --> 03:20:59.710]  It was right next to a Minarda plant covered.
[03:21:00.710 --> 03:21:01.910]  Beautiful.
[03:21:01.910 --> 03:21:05.070]  You get any boitress or just testing with PM?
[03:21:05.070 --> 03:21:06.510]  I was just testing with PM
[03:21:06.510 --> 03:21:09.030]  because that's really the only problem around here.
[03:21:09.030 --> 03:21:12.790]  I get PM in all sorts of my Cucubits primarily.
[03:21:12.790 --> 03:21:14.750]  I have never once in my life seen it
[03:21:14.910 --> 03:21:16.030]  in any of my cannabis here.
[03:21:16.030 --> 03:21:17.910]  And I do not recall seeing it with a kid
[03:21:17.910 --> 03:21:20.230]  in Southern California or Central Coast.
[03:21:20.230 --> 03:21:21.070]  Wow.
[03:21:21.070 --> 03:21:24.030]  Yeah, some of the PMs that are on other plants
[03:21:24.030 --> 03:21:25.350]  do not attack cannabis.
[03:21:25.350 --> 03:21:27.950]  So even if you've got your cannabis plant
[03:21:27.950 --> 03:21:29.870]  next to a plant that has powdery mildew,
[03:21:29.870 --> 03:21:32.990]  if it's not a species from that particular type
[03:21:32.990 --> 03:21:35.150]  of powdery mildew that attacks cannabis,
[03:21:35.150 --> 03:21:37.310]  it's not gonna affect it in any way.
[03:21:37.310 --> 03:21:40.230]  Even if the plant next to it is 100% covered in it.
[03:21:40.230 --> 03:21:41.070]  They're not the same.
[03:21:41.070 --> 03:21:44.390]  There's different strains of powdery mildew molds
[03:21:45.030 --> 03:21:46.670]  that are attacking different plants.
[03:21:46.670 --> 03:21:49.310]  Some will come cross contaminate,
[03:21:49.310 --> 03:21:51.070]  but they're not all exactly the same.
[03:21:51.070 --> 03:21:54.310]  So, and the plants that are out in nature
[03:21:54.310 --> 03:21:55.990]  that are getting up every year,
[03:21:55.990 --> 03:21:57.310]  I'm not positive on this,
[03:21:57.310 --> 03:21:58.910]  but I believe what's happening
[03:21:58.910 --> 03:22:00.110]  is it's kind of the same reason
[03:22:00.110 --> 03:22:03.430]  they will let grapes actually get powdery mildew.
[03:22:03.430 --> 03:22:05.550]  It helps produce more terpenes.
[03:22:05.550 --> 03:22:07.990]  Those terpenes, when the flowers produce,
[03:22:07.990 --> 03:22:10.710]  attract more pollinators.
[03:22:10.710 --> 03:22:13.990]  So the plants trying to get powdery mildew on purpose,
[03:22:14.550 --> 03:22:16.710]  so that it'll produce different chemicals
[03:22:16.710 --> 03:22:20.470]  at a specific time during its natural life,
[03:22:20.470 --> 03:22:22.830]  so that when it does need to attract a pollinator,
[03:22:22.830 --> 03:22:23.870]  that it does.
[03:22:23.870 --> 03:22:24.910]  That's what I'm kind of thinking,
[03:22:24.910 --> 03:22:27.230]  because I've got plants out here that do the same thing.
[03:22:27.230 --> 03:22:28.510]  I've been here for 40 years
[03:22:28.510 --> 03:22:31.270]  and there's a creeping ivy out there.
[03:22:31.270 --> 03:22:34.030]  No matter what you do to that plant, it's getting it.
[03:22:34.030 --> 03:22:36.110]  You can put it in direct sun, in the shade.
[03:22:36.110 --> 03:22:38.470]  You can treat it whatever you want.
[03:22:38.470 --> 03:22:40.350]  It's gonna get powdery mildew every year.
[03:22:40.350 --> 03:22:41.350]  It doesn't die.
[03:22:41.350 --> 03:22:42.830]  It doesn't affect it.
[03:22:42.870 --> 03:22:45.390]  That creeping ivy, I had a bunch of that growing up
[03:22:45.390 --> 03:22:47.790]  in Arcadia in Southern California.
[03:22:47.790 --> 03:22:50.870]  It's almost like that's part of a symbiotic thing.
[03:22:50.870 --> 03:22:51.710]  It's that stuff.
[03:22:51.710 --> 03:22:52.550]  It's always that.
[03:22:52.550 --> 03:22:54.310]  That's what I'm wondering, in nature,
[03:22:54.310 --> 03:22:57.230]  because a lot of people think that powdery mildew's systemic
[03:22:57.230 --> 03:22:58.070]  and it's not.
[03:22:58.070 --> 03:22:58.910]  We know that it's not.
[03:22:58.910 --> 03:23:00.670]  It acts translaminar on the plant,
[03:23:00.670 --> 03:23:02.830]  where it's sitting in pockets of moisture
[03:23:02.830 --> 03:23:05.670]  and the historia have locked on.
[03:23:05.670 --> 03:23:08.230]  And some of that is inside the tissue,
[03:23:08.230 --> 03:23:12.070]  but if it dies, that shit's not alive in the plant no more.
[03:23:12.110 --> 03:23:13.790]  It shoots off spores.
[03:23:13.790 --> 03:23:16.950]  So the plant somehow is attracting it.
[03:23:16.950 --> 03:23:18.790]  It's allowing it in the system.
[03:23:18.790 --> 03:23:23.110]  If it was a negative impact on specific plants in nature,
[03:23:23.110 --> 03:23:25.190]  you'd think those plants would die off, right?
[03:23:25.190 --> 03:23:27.470]  After eventually nature would say that plant's not good.
[03:23:27.470 --> 03:23:29.070]  We're not gonna reproduce.
[03:23:29.070 --> 03:23:32.430]  But if it does it everywhere you put that,
[03:23:32.430 --> 03:23:36.990]  like that's gotta be part of that plant's breeding
[03:23:36.990 --> 03:23:39.270]  or there's some purpose for that plant.
[03:23:39.270 --> 03:23:40.750]  It might be helping it.
[03:23:40.750 --> 03:23:42.670]  I don't know if it's helping it pick up a nutrient
[03:23:42.670 --> 03:23:44.070]  out of the air or something,
[03:23:44.070 --> 03:23:46.110]  because we know nitrogen's all over.
[03:23:46.110 --> 03:23:48.110]  So maybe those plants,
[03:23:48.110 --> 03:23:51.350]  that's a way for it to pull nitrogen out of the atmosphere
[03:23:51.350 --> 03:23:54.350]  and then drop it in the nodules and the root system.
[03:23:54.350 --> 03:23:55.190]  I don't know, man.
[03:23:55.190 --> 03:23:56.710]  I haven't-
[03:23:56.710 --> 03:24:00.350]  You need to study the PM functions more to understand
[03:24:00.350 --> 03:24:03.230]  if that's even, if that's what you're supposing.
[03:24:03.230 --> 03:24:08.230]  Yeah, it's just a theory, but there's a reason for it.
[03:24:08.310 --> 03:24:10.070]  I didn't know there was multiples.
[03:24:10.070 --> 03:24:12.270]  We have a mountain desert
[03:24:12.270 --> 03:24:16.510]  in this little endemic or island protection zone, right?
[03:24:16.510 --> 03:24:20.230]  So like broad mice, I've never had to worry about
[03:24:20.230 --> 03:24:21.790]  or some of these other ones.
[03:24:21.790 --> 03:24:25.030]  And like we have one of the last populations
[03:24:25.030 --> 03:24:27.350]  of American elm here because the American,
[03:24:27.350 --> 03:24:32.070]  the elm disease couldn't make it across the desert.
[03:24:32.070 --> 03:24:33.270]  And there are a couple of little pockets
[03:24:33.270 --> 03:24:36.350]  in spots of California or Nevada desert.
[03:24:36.470 --> 03:24:41.470]  But I wonder about if it mutated out of hops
[03:24:41.870 --> 03:24:45.270]  in more moist areas on the coast
[03:24:45.270 --> 03:24:48.710]  and adapted into our modern plant that way.
[03:24:48.710 --> 03:24:52.670]  Again, through, we talked about back crossing
[03:24:52.670 --> 03:24:54.110]  into the land race and stuff.
[03:24:54.110 --> 03:24:55.590]  And you probably get that protection more
[03:24:55.590 --> 03:24:58.430]  from a sativa strain than anything.
[03:24:58.430 --> 03:25:01.270]  And again, we were saying that PCP
[03:25:01.270 --> 03:25:03.910]  isn't really a Afganica the same way,
[03:25:03.950 --> 03:25:07.070]  even though it's derived out of the Indus region.
[03:25:07.070 --> 03:25:09.270]  It's just slightly different genetics
[03:25:09.270 --> 03:25:11.390]  than all those other regions have.
[03:25:13.390 --> 03:25:16.750]  But I find there's still possible issues
[03:25:16.750 --> 03:25:21.350]  with boitrus in the PCP lines and its derivatives.
[03:25:21.350 --> 03:25:25.510]  So like, even though they can produce really large controllers
[03:25:25.510 --> 03:25:27.190]  you might want to pinch your tops.
[03:25:27.190 --> 03:25:30.870]  And I'm noticing something, I meant to mention this
[03:25:30.870 --> 03:25:33.870]  when I jumped on, my phone wasn't very well charged.
[03:25:34.710 --> 03:25:37.190]  I'm plugged in, but I'm losing charge faster than it's gaining
[03:25:37.190 --> 03:25:39.310]  so I'm going to end up just disappearing here
[03:25:39.310 --> 03:25:40.750]  before it's too long.
[03:25:40.750 --> 03:25:42.150]  And we all had that.
[03:25:42.150 --> 03:25:44.030]  How long has this been going on?
[03:25:45.550 --> 03:25:46.390]  Couple of minutes.
[03:25:46.390 --> 03:25:47.590]  You want to see it?
[03:25:47.590 --> 03:25:49.110]  You mean our conversation?
[03:25:49.110 --> 03:25:50.990]  Are you ready to wrap it up?
[03:25:50.990 --> 03:25:53.870]  No, I was just wondering, he said he's about to die.
[03:25:53.870 --> 03:25:55.070]  His phone's about to die.
[03:25:55.070 --> 03:25:57.230]  325, we're at 325.
[03:25:57.230 --> 03:25:59.030]  Originally I thought it was just going to be you
[03:25:59.030 --> 03:26:01.510]  and me for an hour and now we're three
[03:26:01.510 --> 03:26:03.510]  and a half hours strong, so.
[03:26:04.150 --> 03:26:04.990]  It's been a lot of fun.
[03:26:04.990 --> 03:26:05.950]  I've learned a lot too, man.
[03:26:05.950 --> 03:26:07.430]  You guys are a wealth of knowledge.
[03:26:07.430 --> 03:26:09.750]  You provide an excellent platform, Peter.
[03:26:09.750 --> 03:26:10.590]  That's it.
[03:26:10.590 --> 03:26:12.430]  Thank you for inviting me on and everything.
[03:26:12.430 --> 03:26:15.270]  It's just, I'm honored to be here.
[03:26:15.270 --> 03:26:18.750]  It's to be able to ask questions directly.
[03:26:18.750 --> 03:26:22.350]  I like where people are learning, they can ask questions.
[03:26:22.350 --> 03:26:25.430]  Like even you guys are like learning from each other.
[03:26:25.430 --> 03:26:28.230]  So it's a successful conversation.
[03:26:28.230 --> 03:26:29.070]  Yeah.
[03:26:30.190 --> 03:26:32.470]  Let's fight over some cat piss, what do you think?
[03:26:32.510 --> 03:26:33.350]  Yeah.
[03:26:34.430 --> 03:26:36.990]  The first one holiday for me
[03:26:36.990 --> 03:26:38.830]  was always something a little different
[03:26:38.830 --> 03:26:41.350]  because it happened to like coincide
[03:26:41.350 --> 03:26:44.110]  with the end of ski season at the resort.
[03:26:44.110 --> 03:26:48.470]  And we would carve out what we call a hip jump
[03:26:48.470 --> 03:26:51.190]  on the side of what was called Punk Rock.
[03:26:51.190 --> 03:26:54.350]  And we turned it into a pro ski exhibition
[03:26:54.350 --> 03:26:56.430]  and everyone would wear funny costumes.
[03:26:56.430 --> 03:27:00.670]  And we'd set up a hot dog barbecue for a weenie roast.
[03:27:01.030 --> 03:27:04.670]  And it was the 420 Punk Rock Party.
[03:27:04.670 --> 03:27:07.110]  And we always thought it was cool that it was 420,
[03:27:07.110 --> 03:27:10.430]  but being here, we couldn't like openly display
[03:27:10.430 --> 03:27:14.830]  large sacrament consumption or whatnot.
[03:27:14.830 --> 03:27:19.830]  And literally 2019, I did get to break out
[03:27:20.230 --> 03:27:22.870]  with my mentor who passed away last summer
[03:27:22.870 --> 03:27:24.990]  but closing day on 420,
[03:27:24.990 --> 03:27:28.870]  I did have like a three ounce corn husker pipe joint.
[03:27:30.830 --> 03:27:33.390]  That we passed around at the rock and roll party
[03:27:33.390 --> 03:27:34.950]  at the end and it was in the parking lot
[03:27:34.950 --> 03:27:37.630]  and bringing all these festivals together.
[03:27:37.630 --> 03:27:39.670]  And that ski jump party actually evolved
[03:27:39.670 --> 03:27:43.550]  into a pretty huge festival from like 10 pro skiers
[03:27:43.550 --> 03:27:47.590]  to like several thousand people show up and hang out
[03:27:47.590 --> 03:27:49.430]  and they build loop the loop jumps
[03:27:49.430 --> 03:27:54.110]  and bring it all together for Utah style.
[03:27:54.110 --> 03:27:55.790]  By the way, we don't all drink Budweiser
[03:27:55.790 --> 03:27:58.470]  with funny names on the can here.
[03:28:00.870 --> 03:28:03.990]  Yeah, right on, appreciate y'all great conversations.
[03:28:03.990 --> 03:28:07.790]  And we need to get towed a professorship
[03:28:07.790 --> 03:28:09.950]  at one of the universities, teach improper
[03:28:10.870 --> 03:28:12.350]  and get a salary for it.
[03:28:12.350 --> 03:28:14.230]  Humble state, right?
[03:28:14.230 --> 03:28:15.550]  That's what I need to do.
[03:28:15.550 --> 03:28:18.070]  I need some more books to read, man.
[03:28:18.070 --> 03:28:19.390]  I just need me in the class
[03:28:19.390 --> 03:28:20.230]  to help me out with the people.
[03:28:20.230 --> 03:28:21.870]  We need to write some books for the students to read.
[03:28:21.870 --> 03:28:24.950]  You know, we need to just ramble these lectures off
[03:28:24.950 --> 03:28:27.070]  and get paid for it at the universities.
[03:28:27.070 --> 03:28:28.110]  You know, there's a...
[03:28:28.110 --> 03:28:29.430]  Man, nah.
[03:28:30.270 --> 03:28:32.830]  We need to set this lecture proper
[03:28:32.830 --> 03:28:37.750]  and you tend to have like the highest level of knowledge
[03:28:37.750 --> 03:28:38.750]  on so many subjects,
[03:28:38.750 --> 03:28:41.070]  especially when it comes to the reading and...
[03:28:44.990 --> 03:28:47.750]  I've been, I call it an idiot savant with cannabis, man.
[03:28:47.750 --> 03:28:49.790]  All I did was sit in the basement
[03:28:49.790 --> 03:28:51.950]  and fuck with cannabis, man.
[03:28:51.950 --> 03:28:53.270]  I'm breeding plants.
[03:28:53.270 --> 03:28:58.270]  And then I moved from there to like big ass outdoor shit,
[03:28:58.870 --> 03:29:00.430]  big ass indoor shit,
[03:29:00.430 --> 03:29:01.350]  started running clubs.
[03:29:01.350 --> 03:29:03.790]  Like my life just became cannabis since I was little.
[03:29:03.790 --> 03:29:06.790]  Like I didn't know it was, it just did.
[03:29:06.790 --> 03:29:10.030]  And everything always was about learning about the plant.
[03:29:10.030 --> 03:29:11.350]  And I didn't know I was doing it.
[03:29:11.350 --> 03:29:13.190]  It became second nature.
[03:29:13.190 --> 03:29:16.510]  So man, anyone that sees that, I say respect to them.
[03:29:16.510 --> 03:29:18.590]  So brother, thank you for bringing that up, man.
[03:29:18.590 --> 03:29:21.190]  Cause like, I didn't even know I was doing it.
[03:29:21.190 --> 03:29:23.230]  So it's other people to notice it.
[03:29:24.270 --> 03:29:25.110]  Thank you, man.
[03:29:25.110 --> 03:29:25.950]  Respect to you.
[03:29:30.840 --> 03:29:32.320]  I think we lost him.
[03:29:32.320 --> 03:29:35.880]  So just before I lose it,
[03:29:35.880 --> 03:29:40.320]  someone asked for tips on grind his for days indoors.
[03:29:40.320 --> 03:29:41.160]  Yes, try to keep...
[03:29:41.160 --> 03:29:42.720]  Which you covered a little bit, but...
[03:29:42.720 --> 03:29:45.400]  Yeah, you wanna keep the blue spectrum
[03:29:45.400 --> 03:29:48.840]  around, away from the plant.
[03:29:48.840 --> 03:29:52.080]  She's not gonna flower if you're high in the blue spectrum.
[03:29:52.080 --> 03:29:57.080]  You wanna raise the amount of 660 and 730 nanometers on her.
[03:29:57.640 --> 03:29:59.680]  You're gonna wanna flip her fast or train her
[03:30:00.520 --> 03:30:01.360]  to stay low.
[03:30:01.360 --> 03:30:03.640]  That's why I was talking about bending and weaving her
[03:30:03.640 --> 03:30:07.600]  into a Scrog system with the screen and green.
[03:30:07.600 --> 03:30:11.400]  She's going to stretch extremely fast.
[03:30:11.400 --> 03:30:14.240]  Do not put her in a room with a short cultivars.
[03:30:14.240 --> 03:30:16.480]  She will outgrow that plant.
[03:30:16.480 --> 03:30:19.040]  And the other plants are not gonna produce.
[03:30:19.040 --> 03:30:22.040]  You're gonna need to take her a very long time.
[03:30:22.040 --> 03:30:25.160]  Don't grow her under the center of the light.
[03:30:25.160 --> 03:30:27.280]  So she doesn't grow right into your light.
[03:30:27.440 --> 03:30:31.520]  I would learn to train her indoors.
[03:30:31.520 --> 03:30:32.720]  She's gonna have so much weight.
[03:30:32.720 --> 03:30:34.840]  She's gonna start bending over
[03:30:34.840 --> 03:30:38.400]  and the buds aren't gonna be growing up very easily.
[03:30:38.400 --> 03:30:40.440]  She's very pliable.
[03:30:40.440 --> 03:30:42.200]  And the amount of herbs she can produce
[03:30:42.200 --> 03:30:44.120]  is quite heavy indoors.
[03:30:44.120 --> 03:30:45.000]  It's hard.
[03:30:45.000 --> 03:30:49.040]  So I do recommend people either start her very short.
[03:30:49.040 --> 03:30:51.580]  Like I flip her, like I said,
[03:30:51.580 --> 03:30:55.380]  two feet is the maximum I would grow her indoors, period.
[03:30:55.380 --> 03:30:59.380]  That's after topping her or straight from seed, from clone.
[03:30:59.380 --> 03:31:02.380]  And she's going to end up eight feet tall in that room.
[03:31:04.140 --> 03:31:07.540]  She's gonna go 14 to 20 weeks, depending on phenotype.
[03:31:07.540 --> 03:31:09.700]  If you're growing her for flower,
[03:31:09.700 --> 03:31:13.540]  you can grow her for concentrate and cut the time down.
[03:31:13.540 --> 03:31:17.340]  The test numbers I told you guys was at 62 days.
[03:31:17.340 --> 03:31:22.340]  So 24% THC, 4% CBD and 5.7 CBG off of her
[03:31:23.340 --> 03:31:28.340]  at day 62, which means you can grow her for concentrates
[03:31:28.660 --> 03:31:32.180]  and not have to care about the way the bud structure is.
[03:31:32.180 --> 03:31:34.300]  So the way you grow her is gonna be dependent
[03:31:34.300 --> 03:31:35.700]  on what you're using her for.
[03:31:35.700 --> 03:31:38.780]  I recommend she's bred with into other lines
[03:31:38.780 --> 03:31:41.400]  to open up their structure and make them larger.
[03:31:41.400 --> 03:31:43.780]  And then to cut her flower time down.
[03:31:43.780 --> 03:31:47.140]  It's a plant that I like to have folks.
[03:31:47.140 --> 03:31:49.500]  That's what you learn about other cannabis lines.
[03:31:49.500 --> 03:31:52.100]  It's what you can learn about breeding with.
[03:31:52.860 --> 03:31:53.700]  Learn how to line breed something
[03:31:53.700 --> 03:31:55.060]  from one direction into another
[03:31:55.060 --> 03:31:56.620]  because she's completely different.
[03:31:56.620 --> 03:31:58.900]  Almost everything else you're gonna grow out there.
[03:31:58.900 --> 03:32:00.940]  That's the commercial stuff.
[03:32:00.940 --> 03:32:02.900]  I mean, you guys can get landrace
[03:32:02.900 --> 03:32:04.300]  and some heirloom stuff from people,
[03:32:04.300 --> 03:32:06.220]  but what most people are offering you out there
[03:32:06.220 --> 03:32:08.740]  is gonna be completely different in structure,
[03:32:08.740 --> 03:32:13.380]  terpene profile, flower time, bud structure,
[03:32:13.380 --> 03:32:16.620]  then the haze lines from mine or other people.
[03:32:16.620 --> 03:32:19.860]  But if you recognize the power of the genetics
[03:32:19.860 --> 03:32:23.340]  that are in her, how many other lines are famous
[03:32:23.340 --> 03:32:24.780]  that she's crossed into?
[03:32:26.100 --> 03:32:28.380]  Even if it's an F1 of them, F2,
[03:32:28.380 --> 03:32:33.380]  or they're a progeny of those that like a hybrid of a hybrid,
[03:32:33.620 --> 03:32:36.320]  you still got some haze in it and it's still powerful.
[03:32:38.780 --> 03:32:41.820]  You need patience and curiosity to grow haze too.
[03:32:41.820 --> 03:32:44.900]  100%, 100%.
[03:32:44.900 --> 03:32:47.620]  What's the best cultivar that I have for pain?
[03:32:47.620 --> 03:32:52.140]  My space cush, my mud bone, those would be the two.
[03:32:53.460 --> 03:32:56.660]  I don't sell mud bone anymore at the moment.
[03:32:56.660 --> 03:32:58.260]  I'm working on F2s of it.
[03:32:58.260 --> 03:33:00.380]  I do have some space cush that I was thinking about
[03:33:00.380 --> 03:33:01.680]  possibly sending in.
[03:33:02.780 --> 03:33:05.620]  I had quit offering that plan after I lost my leg
[03:33:07.340 --> 03:33:11.760]  because I sold it for like 14 years
[03:33:11.760 --> 03:33:13.340]  and people just kind of slept on it
[03:33:13.340 --> 03:33:15.900]  and really didn't understand that that's the parent line
[03:33:15.980 --> 03:33:20.980]  to the angel that I had and the other cultivars that I used.
[03:33:21.060 --> 03:33:23.740]  And it was what I used in the,
[03:33:23.740 --> 03:33:26.220]  like the base of my breeding for medicinal purposes.
[03:33:26.220 --> 03:33:28.340]  Like other people are breeding for high THC
[03:33:28.340 --> 03:33:32.180]  or just complete terpene domination or something.
[03:33:32.180 --> 03:33:33.900]  I was breeding for a whole different purpose
[03:33:33.900 --> 03:33:35.020]  when I made those lines.
[03:33:35.020 --> 03:33:38.980]  They were made specifically for medicinal purposes
[03:33:38.980 --> 03:33:42.040]  of the patient base that I knew and had around me,
[03:33:42.040 --> 03:33:45.380]  which was at the maximum was 4,600 people
[03:33:45.820 --> 03:33:47.480]  at the very end when I left.
[03:33:47.480 --> 03:33:50.380]  But at the peak, we were doing 4,400 people.
[03:33:50.380 --> 03:33:55.380]  I had like a 400 people base of different ailments
[03:33:55.380 --> 03:33:58.660]  like cancer, TBI, we've got seizure,
[03:33:58.660 --> 03:34:01.980]  we've got people that have, like my mom, broken back.
[03:34:01.980 --> 03:34:04.500]  Other people are working with PTSD
[03:34:04.500 --> 03:34:07.780]  and I could group them together and offer them plants
[03:34:07.780 --> 03:34:09.720]  and do my breeding through the information
[03:34:09.720 --> 03:34:10.920]  that I gained back from them
[03:34:10.920 --> 03:34:13.820]  instead of just sending it in to get a test report
[03:34:13.820 --> 03:34:18.820]  that said this plant's got 27% THC and 3% CBRD
[03:34:19.220 --> 03:34:22.020]  and like this percentage of terpenes.
[03:34:22.020 --> 03:34:23.500]  I was breeding a different way,
[03:34:23.500 --> 03:34:28.020]  which for me was better for the purposes that I had,
[03:34:28.020 --> 03:34:31.120]  not the only way and not the only correct way,
[03:34:31.120 --> 03:34:35.180]  but this plant can be used in so many different ways.
[03:34:35.180 --> 03:34:36.780]  You can do it commercially,
[03:34:36.780 --> 03:34:39.600]  you can do it straight medicinally,
[03:34:39.600 --> 03:34:42.580]  you can do it through what I call like a hype,
[03:34:42.580 --> 03:34:43.860]  where it's just whatever's new,
[03:34:43.860 --> 03:34:46.740]  you're gonna breed that period, no matter what it is,
[03:34:46.740 --> 03:34:49.580]  which means you put no work into the line,
[03:34:49.580 --> 03:34:51.740]  you're just dropping shit that's there.
[03:34:51.740 --> 03:34:54.740]  There was no purpose for it other than to sell it.
[03:34:54.740 --> 03:34:56.780]  There's just different reasons to do it.
[03:34:56.780 --> 03:34:58.380]  If you understand why you wanna do it,
[03:34:58.380 --> 03:35:01.440]  then you steer for what you're doing that direction.
[03:35:01.440 --> 03:35:04.100]  It doesn't matter what line you start with.
[03:35:04.100 --> 03:35:06.780]  There's a lot of different reasons.
[03:35:06.780 --> 03:35:07.620]  Different ways.
[03:35:07.620 --> 03:35:09.220]  Runs to plants.
[03:35:09.220 --> 03:35:10.340]  Runs to plants.
[03:35:10.340 --> 03:35:13.020]  Turn mids to fucking leads.
[03:35:13.020 --> 03:35:14.740]  Homie, let's do this.
[03:35:14.740 --> 03:35:16.220]  They talk about purple haze lineage.
[03:35:16.220 --> 03:35:20.140]  The purple haze is the magenta Columbian
[03:35:20.140 --> 03:35:22.940]  that they use to make the original haze.
[03:35:22.940 --> 03:35:26.540]  And then out of that, you get purple phenotypes
[03:35:26.540 --> 03:35:28.820]  that come from that three-way haze cross
[03:35:28.820 --> 03:35:30.580]  that made pure haze.
[03:35:31.660 --> 03:35:32.500]  So yeah.
[03:35:32.500 --> 03:35:35.460]  The only purple ones that I saw came from the Dreamtime,
[03:35:35.460 --> 03:35:38.500]  which isn't surprising because that was all crossed up
[03:35:38.980 --> 03:35:40.380]  with whatever he had.
[03:35:40.380 --> 03:35:44.020]  And then also the stuff that I inherited,
[03:35:44.020 --> 03:35:46.020]  which was the NL haze.
[03:35:46.020 --> 03:35:49.180]  And it had a really tight structure
[03:35:49.180 --> 03:35:50.780]  and it was really dark green.
[03:35:50.780 --> 03:35:53.140]  And some of them would, it wouldn't turn out like purple.
[03:35:53.140 --> 03:35:54.620]  It was like a red.
[03:35:54.620 --> 03:35:56.740]  It was like turned red on the tips.
[03:35:57.740 --> 03:35:58.580]  Yeah.
[03:35:58.580 --> 03:35:59.820]  You seen any of that?
[03:36:00.900 --> 03:36:03.140]  Out of the hazes, you can get all kinds.
[03:36:03.140 --> 03:36:04.780]  You can even read all the old forms.
[03:36:04.780 --> 03:36:07.260]  Like you get purple, you're gonna get blue,
[03:36:07.260 --> 03:36:09.940]  magenta, silver, greens.
[03:36:09.940 --> 03:36:12.340]  There's gold versions that come out of the hazes.
[03:36:12.340 --> 03:36:15.720]  And it all comes out of that original haze three-way mix
[03:36:15.720 --> 03:36:20.660]  of the Punta Rojo, the green and the purple Columbian.
[03:36:20.660 --> 03:36:22.020]  And then from there, when they,
[03:36:22.020 --> 03:36:24.020]  the phenotypes that come out of that
[03:36:24.020 --> 03:36:25.620]  are end up where you get the purple haze.
[03:36:25.620 --> 03:36:28.780]  So that three-way cross shows phenotypes
[03:36:28.780 --> 03:36:31.100]  of all those other ones, the silver, the blue,
[03:36:31.100 --> 03:36:34.380]  the purple, the green, and each one of those comes out.
[03:36:34.380 --> 03:36:37.660]  So the purple haze originally was the magenta
[03:36:37.660 --> 03:36:39.180]  called root beer.
[03:36:39.180 --> 03:36:41.100]  It was more of a leathery flavor.
[03:36:42.060 --> 03:36:44.380]  The plant turned more of a maroon
[03:36:44.380 --> 03:36:47.220]  than like the, like a purple oracle is.
[03:36:47.220 --> 03:36:48.180]  It's like more purple.
[03:36:48.180 --> 03:36:53.180]  It's more like a Mindo purple in that maroonish purple.
[03:36:53.220 --> 03:36:55.500]  So the way that comes out of it,
[03:36:55.500 --> 03:36:58.460]  it used to be called the magenta or root beer phenotypes
[03:36:58.460 --> 03:37:00.260]  that were coming out of that strain.
[03:37:01.420 --> 03:37:03.220]  And after, like Jimmy,
[03:37:03.220 --> 03:37:04.900]  it doesn't get the name from Jimmy Hendrix.
[03:37:04.900 --> 03:37:07.420]  He get it from Oswald's fucking acid, man.
[03:37:07.420 --> 03:37:10.020]  The purple, the purple shit he used to slang.
[03:37:10.020 --> 03:37:11.540]  They used to be sold in different color,
[03:37:11.540 --> 03:37:13.540]  like orange and white and purple.
[03:37:14.500 --> 03:37:15.340]  And originally it was-
[03:37:15.340 --> 03:37:17.380]  I really didn't like the purple ones when I found them.
[03:37:17.380 --> 03:37:20.220]  Like whenever I, I popped a lot of those different seeds
[03:37:20.220 --> 03:37:23.220]  from all of those various sources.
[03:37:23.220 --> 03:37:26.940]  And the purple was kind of rare
[03:37:26.940 --> 03:37:28.700]  and it wasn't all that great.
[03:37:28.700 --> 03:37:29.780]  It wasn't the best.
[03:37:29.780 --> 03:37:31.580]  There was always something better around
[03:37:31.620 --> 03:37:34.060]  and it was usually like light green.
[03:37:34.060 --> 03:37:34.900]  I feel the same way.
[03:37:34.900 --> 03:37:37.460]  And it was like a hundred percent.
[03:37:37.460 --> 03:37:39.500]  That's why I never bred for purple on purpose.
[03:37:39.500 --> 03:37:40.820]  Like it would come out of my lines
[03:37:40.820 --> 03:37:44.940]  because it was a recessive phenotype or allele in the line.
[03:37:44.940 --> 03:37:46.740]  But I never bred for purple.
[03:37:46.740 --> 03:37:51.220]  They never were the more medicinal side for me at all.
[03:37:51.220 --> 03:37:53.340]  The plant, all the plant was doing was trying to build up
[03:37:53.340 --> 03:37:55.780]  a defense to the environment out there.
[03:37:55.780 --> 03:38:00.340]  And color for me usually isn't going to bring
[03:38:00.340 --> 03:38:02.420]  more medicinal power in the line.
[03:38:02.420 --> 03:38:03.780]  It just isn't.
[03:38:03.780 --> 03:38:05.500]  Let's just say it's a pure-
[03:38:05.500 --> 03:38:06.340]  Go for it.
[03:38:06.340 --> 03:38:07.940]  Would you agree that cannabis is kind of lazy
[03:38:07.940 --> 03:38:11.060]  and it like chooses where it wants to expend its energy.
[03:38:11.060 --> 03:38:15.300]  So like it's usually purple is associated
[03:38:15.300 --> 03:38:17.100]  with just a little bit off
[03:38:17.100 --> 03:38:20.060]  because it's expending its energy towards that purple shit
[03:38:20.060 --> 03:38:23.820]  instead of building cannabinoids in the resin heads.
[03:38:23.820 --> 03:38:26.580]  It depends on like the purpose that early.
[03:38:26.580 --> 03:38:27.420]  Like when you ever pop the seedling-
[03:38:27.420 --> 03:38:28.820]  I know that there's good purple.
[03:38:28.820 --> 03:38:30.100]  I'm not knocking the purple here.
[03:38:30.820 --> 03:38:31.660]  I don't, I want to be clear.
[03:38:31.660 --> 03:38:32.500]  Sorry.
[03:38:32.500 --> 03:38:35.220]  It could be state specific like a seedling
[03:38:35.220 --> 03:38:37.380]  when it pops out and has a purple stem
[03:38:37.380 --> 03:38:38.660]  it's making an anthocyanin
[03:38:38.660 --> 03:38:40.020]  and that's how protecting itself
[03:38:40.020 --> 03:38:43.620]  against high amounts of light.
[03:38:43.620 --> 03:38:45.500]  So there's too much UV light.
[03:38:45.500 --> 03:38:48.020]  There's too much spectrum outside.
[03:38:48.020 --> 03:38:49.900]  Nature has made that plant producing.
[03:38:49.900 --> 03:38:51.260]  I'm trying to remember the name of it.
[03:38:51.260 --> 03:38:52.820]  Canatan, I think it's called.
[03:38:52.820 --> 03:38:54.220]  C-A-N-T-I-N.
[03:38:54.220 --> 03:38:59.020]  It's a specific type of anthocyanin that's purple
[03:38:59.020 --> 03:39:00.740]  that's produced in the stem of plants
[03:39:00.740 --> 03:39:02.660]  that helps produce against too much light.
[03:39:02.660 --> 03:39:03.500]  Right?
[03:39:03.500 --> 03:39:07.340]  So sometimes purple is a specific mechanism
[03:39:07.340 --> 03:39:08.620]  to protect that plant.
[03:39:08.620 --> 03:39:11.980]  So it wouldn't be lazy at that point.
[03:39:11.980 --> 03:39:14.700]  This is an actual trait that's bred
[03:39:14.700 --> 03:39:17.460]  to a certain lines that are going to do this
[03:39:17.460 --> 03:39:21.420]  that could or could not come out later in flower.
[03:39:21.420 --> 03:39:24.340]  Like Mean Jeans showing his purple line that he has.
[03:39:24.340 --> 03:39:25.460]  I'm trying to remember what it is.
[03:39:25.460 --> 03:39:26.820]  I've got some of the seeds.
[03:39:26.820 --> 03:39:30.900]  That thing throws purple from the stem
[03:39:30.900 --> 03:39:34.220]  all the way to the center of the leaf.
[03:39:34.220 --> 03:39:35.900]  The day it starts popping new leaves
[03:39:35.900 --> 03:39:39.580]  out of the plant before the coelodont show.
[03:39:39.580 --> 03:39:42.620]  And even sometimes those are purple out of his plant.
[03:39:42.620 --> 03:39:45.900]  So it's just all cultivar and stage specific.
[03:39:45.900 --> 03:39:49.180]  But I think that lazy was a poor choice of word.
[03:39:49.180 --> 03:39:51.540]  What I really meant is that it's efficient.
[03:39:51.540 --> 03:39:54.940]  Like I've noticed this with other plants too.
[03:39:54.940 --> 03:39:57.340]  But cannabis seems to be really dramatic about it
[03:39:57.340 --> 03:40:01.380]  as how it chooses where it's gonna expend its energy.
[03:40:01.380 --> 03:40:02.220]  Oh, I understand.
[03:40:02.220 --> 03:40:04.220]  Okay, I see what you're saying.
[03:40:04.220 --> 03:40:07.220]  Well, I guess it is.
[03:40:07.220 --> 03:40:09.500]  Cause sometimes they're gonna do it no matter what.
[03:40:09.500 --> 03:40:12.300]  And I sometimes like, if it doesn't turn purple
[03:40:12.300 --> 03:40:13.380]  people wanna argue with you.
[03:40:13.380 --> 03:40:15.100]  Like I just brought this up
[03:40:15.100 --> 03:40:17.140]  and they wanna get mad if they haven't seen it.
[03:40:17.140 --> 03:40:19.100]  That's why I just post like screenshots
[03:40:19.100 --> 03:40:20.220]  of the shit I'm reading.
[03:40:20.220 --> 03:40:22.420]  Hoping people will go to the link I'm talking about
[03:40:22.420 --> 03:40:23.380]  and make their own decision.
[03:40:23.380 --> 03:40:27.420]  But specifically some plants are making purple
[03:40:27.420 --> 03:40:28.940]  for a specific reason.
[03:40:28.940 --> 03:40:32.500]  Some of them are, it's a environmental cue to temperature
[03:40:32.500 --> 03:40:35.860]  or some type of a stressor that happened to the plant.
[03:40:35.860 --> 03:40:40.060]  It's all being driven through hormones,
[03:40:40.060 --> 03:40:42.580]  enzymes, sugar production,
[03:40:42.580 --> 03:40:45.660]  the way the plants sequestering carbon.
[03:40:45.660 --> 03:40:47.500]  All these things are gonna cause it
[03:40:47.500 --> 03:40:49.780]  to show different phenotypal expressions.
[03:40:49.780 --> 03:40:52.460]  So that purple could pop up randomly at any time.
[03:40:53.420 --> 03:40:54.900]  It can show up in breeding also.
[03:40:54.900 --> 03:40:57.540]  You could have two cultivars that never showed purple.
[03:40:57.540 --> 03:40:59.620]  And then one of the seeds that pop out of there
[03:40:59.620 --> 03:41:02.620]  you get this bright purple plant that breeds purple.
[03:41:02.620 --> 03:41:05.500]  That's now showing atavistic traits
[03:41:05.500 --> 03:41:08.580]  that come through randomly in breeding.
[03:41:08.580 --> 03:41:12.980]  Like you could not in any way drive what's happening.
[03:41:12.980 --> 03:41:15.060]  Nature has decided periodically
[03:41:15.060 --> 03:41:18.580]  it's going to insert a copy of the genes
[03:41:18.580 --> 03:41:22.180]  from a grandparent four generations before, right?
[03:41:22.220 --> 03:41:23.620]  It's just gonna do this.
[03:41:23.620 --> 03:41:25.620]  It has decided this is real shit.
[03:41:25.620 --> 03:41:26.460]  Like I didn't make this up.
[03:41:26.460 --> 03:41:28.180]  Well, seeds are wonderful, right?
[03:41:28.180 --> 03:41:29.580]  Yeah, this is awesome shit.
[03:41:29.580 --> 03:41:31.060]  This is what the power of the plan is.
[03:41:31.060 --> 03:41:31.900]  That's why I tell everybody,
[03:41:31.900 --> 03:41:34.500]  why do I gotta stabilize for everything that you're after?
[03:41:34.500 --> 03:41:37.460]  When nature has decided it's gonna use
[03:41:37.460 --> 03:41:40.020]  all these different reasons to do different things
[03:41:40.020 --> 03:41:41.500]  at specific times.
[03:41:41.500 --> 03:41:43.060]  I can't do shit with that
[03:41:43.060 --> 03:41:45.860]  except pick what I liked out of them
[03:41:45.860 --> 03:41:47.940]  and offer you my selection, man.
[03:41:47.940 --> 03:41:51.500]  Or I can make as many versions of the genes
[03:41:51.540 --> 03:41:53.860]  that are available to me and offer you that.
[03:41:53.860 --> 03:41:56.500]  And that's just what I can do.
[03:41:56.500 --> 03:41:58.540]  The plant's gonna decide in your garden
[03:41:58.540 --> 03:42:00.260]  to do what the fuck it wants to do.
[03:42:00.260 --> 03:42:02.300]  It's gonna throw skinny leaves there.
[03:42:02.300 --> 03:42:04.780]  It's like I've shown my, like the pure kush.
[03:42:04.780 --> 03:42:08.460]  I've shown it grown indoor, outdoor, and in a hoop house
[03:42:08.460 --> 03:42:11.380]  and how it's changed the shape of the leaf in all three.
[03:42:11.380 --> 03:42:13.820]  And they're all a clone of the original plant
[03:42:13.820 --> 03:42:18.300]  that Kevin passed to me back in 2015 at the Emerald Cup.
[03:42:18.300 --> 03:42:20.220]  I showed the girls next to Bubba
[03:42:20.220 --> 03:42:23.580]  to show the similarities of Bubba before Phyllis was out.
[03:42:23.580 --> 03:42:26.900]  And then Kevin had put both of them into Phyllis
[03:42:26.900 --> 03:42:29.260]  and they both come back related in some way.
[03:42:29.260 --> 03:42:30.100]  There's no way to tell
[03:42:30.100 --> 03:42:31.540]  because they don't have the base parents
[03:42:31.540 --> 03:42:32.980]  to either one of them,
[03:42:32.980 --> 03:42:37.180]  but they show to be related in the galaxy there.
[03:42:37.180 --> 03:42:38.500]  So the Bubba and the pure kush
[03:42:38.500 --> 03:42:40.700]  that I'd already thought were related
[03:42:40.700 --> 03:42:43.700]  come up related to each other when they do a genetic test.
[03:42:43.700 --> 03:42:46.340]  But without having the original material that made both,
[03:42:46.340 --> 03:42:50.060]  they can't tell you, are they siblings?
[03:42:50.900 --> 03:42:51.740]  Are they cousins?
[03:42:51.740 --> 03:42:54.180]  Are they different generations coming
[03:42:54.180 --> 03:42:56.060]  from the same type of parents?
[03:42:57.820 --> 03:42:59.620]  Anthocyanins can help with heat.
[03:42:59.620 --> 03:43:03.580]  They can help with keeping light off the plant.
[03:43:03.580 --> 03:43:06.940]  They can attract different pollinators.
[03:43:06.940 --> 03:43:08.740]  That's why I say it depends on the time period
[03:43:08.740 --> 03:43:09.940]  that plant is.
[03:43:09.940 --> 03:43:14.940]  A male cannabis is attracted to bees really, real big.
[03:43:15.620 --> 03:43:18.380]  Go outside and you can see bees just swarm to them.
[03:43:18.380 --> 03:43:20.420]  Now I haven't tried purple plants
[03:43:20.420 --> 03:43:21.540]  because I don't breed with purple,
[03:43:21.540 --> 03:43:23.980]  but I'm wondering if the purple
[03:43:23.980 --> 03:43:27.980]  or maybe the maroon plants will be more attracted
[03:43:27.980 --> 03:43:29.620]  to a bee than the green one.
[03:43:29.620 --> 03:43:31.140]  Since under a UV light,
[03:43:31.140 --> 03:43:33.860]  those are gonna show a different color pattern,
[03:43:33.860 --> 03:43:34.900]  which bees to see.
[03:43:34.900 --> 03:43:37.580]  They're seeing the UV coloring of that plant.
[03:43:37.580 --> 03:43:38.940]  So they smell it.
[03:43:38.940 --> 03:43:40.500]  It's got a high terpene profile.
[03:43:40.500 --> 03:43:42.780]  And then the color to them looks attractive.
[03:43:42.780 --> 03:43:44.420]  They think it's a flower and go straight over
[03:43:44.420 --> 03:43:46.980]  to the male plant and start collecting the pollen.
[03:43:46.980 --> 03:43:48.100]  And then as they're flying away,
[03:43:48.780 --> 03:43:49.740]  if you put your male near the female,
[03:43:49.740 --> 03:43:52.860]  they go through the female and pollinate the female.
[03:43:52.860 --> 03:43:55.420]  So you can use bees as a pollinator for cannabis.
[03:43:55.420 --> 03:43:57.140]  I did that with the haze for days.
[03:43:57.140 --> 03:43:59.140]  It wasn't the only pollinator,
[03:43:59.140 --> 03:44:02.660]  but I did have the bees attracted to that male.
[03:44:02.660 --> 03:44:04.900]  And it was directly in the same pot
[03:44:04.900 --> 03:44:06.940]  and in the trellis system of the female.
[03:44:06.940 --> 03:44:09.380]  I set it up where I took a three gallon male
[03:44:09.380 --> 03:44:12.060]  and set it up a foot above the ground
[03:44:12.060 --> 03:44:15.280]  in the 65 gallon pot so that it was pollinated directly
[03:44:15.280 --> 03:44:19.200]  into the foliage of the female when I made those F4s.
[03:44:19.200 --> 03:44:20.880]  That's how I bred it.
[03:44:20.880 --> 03:44:22.960]  It's fun watching those bees rolling around
[03:44:22.960 --> 03:44:25.200]  in that pollen getting all covered in it too.
[03:44:25.200 --> 03:44:26.520]  They'd love it, man.
[03:44:26.520 --> 03:44:28.000]  Bees love pollen.
[03:44:28.000 --> 03:44:28.820]  They love it.
[03:44:28.820 --> 03:44:30.200]  They love male cannabis pollen.
[03:44:30.200 --> 03:44:31.040]  It's crazy.
[03:44:32.040 --> 03:44:35.040]  I never seen them really like kick it on a female plant.
[03:44:35.040 --> 03:44:37.620]  And they might, one or two might go on there,
[03:44:37.620 --> 03:44:39.240]  but males, they'll swarm it.
[03:44:40.600 --> 03:44:42.580]  Seems like spiders like the females.
[03:44:42.580 --> 03:44:44.720]  I get a lot of spiders on my outdoor plants.
[03:44:45.320 --> 03:44:46.960]  Hey, I'm not bitching.
[03:44:46.960 --> 03:44:47.960]  No, dude, those are good.
[03:44:47.960 --> 03:44:49.840]  They're gonna eat all those fucking bugs.
[03:44:49.840 --> 03:44:53.520]  They're gonna eat bugs, spiders, wasps, green lacewings.
[03:44:53.520 --> 03:44:56.380]  They're all gonna chew the fuck out of large pests
[03:44:56.380 --> 03:45:00.960]  like aphids, like white flies.
[03:45:00.960 --> 03:45:03.520]  They'll even fuck with caterpillars, the wasps.
[03:45:03.520 --> 03:45:04.960]  Get parasitic wasps.
[03:45:04.960 --> 03:45:06.240]  They'll start fucking with everything
[03:45:06.240 --> 03:45:07.760]  that gets on your plant.
[03:45:07.760 --> 03:45:09.060]  Kill the fuck out of them.
[03:45:10.840 --> 03:45:11.680]  For real.
[03:45:17.640 --> 03:45:21.800]  So why don't we wrap it there?
[03:45:22.800 --> 03:45:23.640]  Okay.
[03:45:23.640 --> 03:45:24.460]  All right.
[03:45:24.460 --> 03:45:26.800]  Someone, I'm trying to think there was a,
[03:45:26.800 --> 03:45:30.320]  no, maybe, well, I keep losing the,
[03:45:30.320 --> 03:45:31.140]  oh, wait, sorry.
[03:45:31.140 --> 03:45:35.680]  There was a question that I, this one from the big kush,
[03:45:36.560 --> 03:45:37.940]  like big perm.
[03:45:44.170 --> 03:45:45.570]  Do you see that one?
[03:45:45.570 --> 03:45:46.410]  Yeah.
[03:45:46.410 --> 03:45:47.250]  I was gonna ask this earlier.
[03:45:47.250 --> 03:45:50.610]  I've got Kim Moore and I've got three of them.
[03:45:50.690 --> 03:45:52.730]  Kim D, Kim 4, and Kim 91.
[03:45:54.050 --> 03:45:58.290]  I like Kim 4 and Kim 91 more than D.
[03:46:00.450 --> 03:46:03.970]  So I go with 91 if I'm smoking it,
[03:46:03.970 --> 03:46:05.810]  Kim 4 if I'm growing it,
[03:46:05.810 --> 03:46:10.810]  and Kim D if I wanna breed and offer selection
[03:46:10.890 --> 03:46:14.090]  because like I'm using all three of my breeding,
[03:46:14.090 --> 03:46:17.970]  but I do prefer the 91 over the 4 and the D,
[03:46:17.970 --> 03:46:19.670]  and I prefer the 4 over the D.
[03:46:24.950 --> 03:46:29.950]  So just some quick housekeeping.
[03:46:30.590 --> 03:46:34.750]  Tonight, or probably late afternoon,
[03:46:34.750 --> 03:46:38.110]  cause I got family dinner probably around six-ish,
[03:46:38.110 --> 03:46:41.110]  but one of my best friends from high school
[03:46:41.110 --> 03:46:45.110]  is gonna come on and play some music, James Lake.
[03:46:47.630 --> 03:46:51.370]  And then yesterday, just an update.
[03:46:51.570 --> 03:46:56.570]  I cut a check to get, that's Christian Carter.
[03:46:58.930 --> 03:47:01.330]  People have been following along that story.
[03:47:02.250 --> 03:47:05.010]  You gotta remember guys like this on days like today, man.
[03:47:05.010 --> 03:47:08.650]  It's 420, there's still people suffering over this shit.
[03:47:08.650 --> 03:47:11.870]  So he's been in jail since last summer.
[03:47:12.810 --> 03:47:17.410]  You all helped get him legal representation.
[03:47:17.930 --> 03:47:21.610]  Tully Weiss, Ashley from Tully Weiss,
[03:47:21.610 --> 03:47:25.370]  which is a fantastic law firm is representing him.
[03:47:26.930 --> 03:47:31.890]  I just cut a $3,000 check for his bail,
[03:47:31.890 --> 03:47:35.050]  which was basically got negotiated.
[03:47:36.810 --> 03:47:40.090]  I guess the bail company goes to the insurance company.
[03:47:40.090 --> 03:47:41.970]  His bail is 150,000,
[03:47:41.970 --> 03:47:44.410]  but they go to the insurance company with something
[03:47:44.410 --> 03:47:47.610]  and the insurance company evaluates the risk.
[03:47:47.610 --> 03:47:50.610]  And so they're gonna let me know today
[03:47:50.610 --> 03:47:55.610]  whether 6,000 plus $400 monthly payments.
[03:47:56.530 --> 03:47:59.490]  I think over the next two years or something
[03:47:59.490 --> 03:48:02.210]  to get to 12,000 is sufficient,
[03:48:04.410 --> 03:48:06.730]  but I'll know by the end of the day
[03:48:06.730 --> 03:48:09.370]  and hopefully Christian will be out today,
[03:48:09.370 --> 03:48:14.050]  which is a good symbolic day for him to get out of jail
[03:48:15.010 --> 03:48:17.170]  after I think, what is it, April, May?
[03:48:17.170 --> 03:48:18.810]  It's been like nine months
[03:48:18.810 --> 03:48:21.750]  that he's been in jail during coronavirus.
[03:48:23.130 --> 03:48:24.890]  So thank you all.
[03:48:24.890 --> 03:48:27.170]  And when you pick up packs,
[03:48:27.170 --> 03:48:30.790]  that kind of helps me do shit like this.
[03:48:31.730 --> 03:48:34.530]  And I think we're gonna try to raise,
[03:48:34.530 --> 03:48:37.690]  I have all these, here, hold on.
[03:48:38.770 --> 03:48:40.690]  Yeah, all of my stuff goes to Peter.
[03:48:40.690 --> 03:48:42.690]  That's for this channel.
[03:48:42.690 --> 03:48:45.530]  Thank you for providing this
[03:48:45.530 --> 03:48:48.610]  through all of this nonsense we've lived with
[03:48:48.610 --> 03:48:49.770]  over the past year.
[03:48:51.090 --> 03:48:54.930]  These are all seed packs from various breeders.
[03:48:54.930 --> 03:48:56.330]  So these will start going up
[03:48:56.330 --> 03:48:58.170]  to help raise money for different things,
[03:48:58.170 --> 03:49:00.370]  but let me put it down before it falls over.
[03:49:09.360 --> 03:49:10.200]  So,
[03:49:10.640 --> 03:49:11.640]  and with that,
[03:49:21.030 --> 03:49:22.310]  yeah, it's,
[03:49:23.150 --> 03:49:26.330]  oh, so actually you guys can hold on for a second.
[03:49:27.710 --> 03:49:30.990]  Give me one second to put,
[03:49:33.390 --> 03:49:35.290]  whoops, hold tight.
[03:49:40.600 --> 03:49:41.960]  Oh, all right, here we go.
[03:49:42.320 --> 03:49:43.880]  Give me one second.
[03:49:47.720 --> 03:49:51.080]  Here comes, but everyone in the chat already knows
[03:49:51.080 --> 03:49:52.400]  who's about to come on.
[03:49:52.400 --> 03:49:54.640]  It's not really much of a surprise.
[03:50:00.100 --> 03:50:02.280]  Okay, email has been sent.
[03:50:03.860 --> 03:50:06.260]  So hold tight for a minute.
[03:50:06.260 --> 03:50:08.780]  Let me just make sure it went out.
[03:50:08.780 --> 03:50:11.660]  Yes, it has gone out.
[03:50:13.820 --> 03:50:14.900]  What are you doing, honey?
[03:50:14.900 --> 03:50:17.380]  This is our, so actually,
[03:50:18.500 --> 03:50:19.340]  what's that?
[03:50:21.860 --> 03:50:23.000]  Hold that up again.
[03:50:24.340 --> 03:50:27.560]  Oh, this is a clone that I'm doing in water right here.
[03:50:27.560 --> 03:50:32.560]  I'm testing a theory of using water at 30% by volume
[03:50:33.420 --> 03:50:35.860]  with 3% hydrogen peroxide added to it.
[03:50:35.860 --> 03:50:38.420]  I'm changing the water every two days.
[03:50:38.420 --> 03:50:41.100]  I'm testing to see how quickly she'll root.
[03:50:41.100 --> 03:50:43.020]  She's been in there for four days right now.
[03:50:43.020 --> 03:50:44.580]  It's a dog walker OG.
[03:50:45.900 --> 03:50:48.640]  I'm testing it next to other ones that are in
[03:50:48.640 --> 03:50:51.020]  the Oasis pucks that I usually do.
[03:50:51.020 --> 03:50:52.780]  I just wanna see how fast it'll root.
[03:50:52.780 --> 03:50:54.580]  I know it'll root in water.
[03:50:54.580 --> 03:50:56.300]  I just wanna see how fast it'll do it.
[03:50:56.300 --> 03:50:59.140]  So we're at day four on the dog walker.
[03:50:59.140 --> 03:51:00.220]  I'm doing some tests with this
[03:51:00.220 --> 03:51:02.740]  before I get my outdoor garden set up.
[03:51:04.380 --> 03:51:05.740]  I got about three more days
[03:51:05.740 --> 03:51:07.140]  and I should have everything for that
[03:51:07.140 --> 03:51:09.140]  and be able to put some plants out there.
[03:51:11.760 --> 03:51:15.880]  But so does anyone have good,
[03:51:15.880 --> 03:51:19.120]  I just picked up some cucumber seeds,
[03:51:19.120 --> 03:51:22.320]  but if anyone has, basically my daughters eat cucumber
[03:51:22.320 --> 03:51:27.160]  like all day long and that's why I brought it at home.
[03:51:28.200 --> 03:51:31.120]  Anyone has a cucumber they're passionate about?
[03:51:31.120 --> 03:51:33.840]  I will have to go get it.
[03:51:33.840 --> 03:51:34.800]  Hello.
[03:51:34.800 --> 03:51:36.080]  What's up Brandon?
[03:51:36.080 --> 03:51:36.920]  What's up?
[03:51:36.920 --> 03:51:37.760]  You are on mute.
[03:51:37.760 --> 03:51:38.600]  What's up?
[03:51:41.830 --> 03:51:44.150]  And actually I have a,
[03:51:46.430 --> 03:51:47.670]  it's ready to go.
[03:51:51.030 --> 03:51:53.430]  He made that one for me probably.
[03:51:53.430 --> 03:51:55.730]  I have to do that pretty frequently.
[03:51:57.230 --> 03:52:01.630]  I had to plug in the mixing board.
[03:52:01.630 --> 03:52:02.710]  There you go.
[03:52:02.710 --> 03:52:03.630]  Wasn't plugged in.
[03:52:05.870 --> 03:52:06.990]  How's it going man?
[03:52:06.990 --> 03:52:09.350]  Can you bring your volume up a little bit?
[03:52:09.350 --> 03:52:10.950]  Can you on the mixing board?
[03:52:10.950 --> 03:52:12.910]  Yeah, is that better?
[03:52:12.910 --> 03:52:14.230]  Yeah.
[03:52:14.230 --> 03:52:15.230]  Cool.
[03:52:15.230 --> 03:52:18.390]  I can also move the mic closer a little bit too.
[03:52:18.390 --> 03:52:19.230]  There we go.
[03:52:19.230 --> 03:52:20.430]  How's everybody doing?
[03:52:20.430 --> 03:52:21.910]  Happy 420 everybody.
[03:52:21.910 --> 03:52:22.750]  Happy 420.
[03:52:22.750 --> 03:52:24.870]  How was the, what was it?
[03:52:24.870 --> 03:52:26.230]  The Cannapalooza?
[03:52:26.230 --> 03:52:27.350]  Was that the?
[03:52:28.590 --> 03:52:31.870]  Okay, so I like to go to the cannabis events
[03:52:31.870 --> 03:52:34.950]  and that's the Jack Herrera Cup Cannapalooza.
[03:52:34.950 --> 03:52:36.590]  Man, the first day I got there,
[03:52:36.590 --> 03:52:41.590]  I literally, I couldn't even do like a lap around the place.
[03:52:41.790 --> 03:52:44.310]  Every 20 feet I was stopped by somebody that was like,
[03:52:44.310 --> 03:52:45.470]  Brandon, what's up?
[03:52:45.470 --> 03:52:46.310]  Oh, I'm on it.
[03:52:47.510 --> 03:52:50.150]  So I made sure to bring like a bag of seeds with me
[03:52:50.150 --> 03:52:55.150]  and I hooked everybody up that recognized me
[03:52:55.390 --> 03:52:57.710]  and that I chatted with and stuff.
[03:52:57.710 --> 03:52:59.190]  Hell yeah.
[03:52:59.190 --> 03:53:02.470]  I think I might be doing some future consulting
[03:53:02.510 --> 03:53:07.470]  with Carter Creek Cannabis who works with Jinx
[03:53:08.910 --> 03:53:10.270]  out here in Oklahoma too.
[03:53:10.270 --> 03:53:13.590]  So met some people that I've been talking to
[03:53:13.590 --> 03:53:16.630]  in person finally and it's good to make connections
[03:53:16.630 --> 03:53:19.350]  and get into the community.
[03:53:20.750 --> 03:53:22.510]  Hell yeah, hell yeah.
[03:53:22.510 --> 03:53:23.870]  Awesome.
[03:53:23.870 --> 03:53:25.830]  Jinx got some good stuff, man.
[03:53:27.870 --> 03:53:29.910]  I smoked some of their Hell on Wheels, man.
[03:53:29.910 --> 03:53:33.230]  It was delicious.
[03:53:33.230 --> 03:53:34.070]  Right on.
[03:53:40.170 --> 03:53:43.170]  I know that you guys were just talking about
[03:53:43.170 --> 03:53:45.930]  how there's a lot of people that are still incarcerated
[03:53:46.930 --> 03:53:50.010]  for cannabis which is absolutely insane.
[03:53:50.010 --> 03:53:52.690]  I mean, I've been in a position in California
[03:53:52.690 --> 03:53:56.930]  where I was doing a prison term.
[03:53:57.850 --> 03:54:01.330]  This was in 2017, 2018.
[03:54:01.330 --> 03:54:05.010]  And the laws changed while I was in there
[03:54:05.010 --> 03:54:07.930]  but there was no retroactive sentencing
[03:54:07.930 --> 03:54:09.210]  or anything like that.
[03:54:09.210 --> 03:54:11.850]  So really didn't make a difference.
[03:54:11.850 --> 03:54:13.610]  And it didn't change the fact that I,
[03:54:13.610 --> 03:54:15.250]  because I was already incarcerated,
[03:54:15.250 --> 03:54:16.690]  it didn't allow me to get out.
[03:54:16.690 --> 03:54:21.690]  But there are so many freaking people still locked up
[03:54:21.690 --> 03:54:25.390]  and it's really all just about economics
[03:54:25.390 --> 03:54:30.390]  because there's a huge, huge economic driven institutions
[03:54:34.230 --> 03:54:38.350]  and principles that drive incarceration in this country.
[03:54:38.350 --> 03:54:40.070]  Because if you look at the statistics
[03:54:40.070 --> 03:54:42.790]  and what most people are incarcerated for,
[03:54:43.710 --> 03:54:48.030]  it's usually drug offenses and petty crimes.
[03:54:48.030 --> 03:54:50.350]  And a lot of these things are,
[03:54:50.350 --> 03:54:54.270]  they're usually like social and health issues
[03:54:54.270 --> 03:54:56.070]  as opposed to like criminal issues
[03:54:56.070 --> 03:54:59.950]  because we have these statutories,
[03:54:59.950 --> 03:55:04.950]  the statutory jurisdiction that we all are kind of
[03:55:07.350 --> 03:55:08.710]  institutionalized by.
[03:55:08.710 --> 03:55:13.710]  And it's not really a constitutional jurisdiction
[03:55:18.670 --> 03:55:19.870]  of the justice system.
[03:55:19.870 --> 03:55:23.450]  And so you can have these laws written
[03:55:23.450 --> 03:55:26.330]  and you can commit a crime when there's no victim.
[03:55:26.330 --> 03:55:28.850]  And technically that's not really possible.
[03:55:28.850 --> 03:55:32.850]  Like under common law, there has to be a crime committed.
[03:55:32.850 --> 03:55:34.050]  There has to be a victim,
[03:55:34.050 --> 03:55:39.050]  but we have all of these things that are in place
[03:55:39.490 --> 03:55:41.910]  strictly to create income.
[03:55:41.910 --> 03:55:43.530]  And a lot of that income's
[03:55:43.530 --> 03:55:46.330]  from the poorest groups of people.
[03:55:46.330 --> 03:55:48.130]  It's not, it is racist,
[03:55:48.130 --> 03:55:51.050]  but it's more classist than it is racist.
[03:55:56.970 --> 03:55:58.890]  Yeah, one of the things,
[03:55:58.890 --> 03:56:02.490]  I mean, when I was talking to Ashley about Christian's case,
[03:56:02.490 --> 03:56:04.450]  I mean, it's like even bail,
[03:56:04.450 --> 03:56:06.930]  like basically if you're rich, you can afford it.
[03:56:06.930 --> 03:56:08.930]  If you're poor, you sit in jail, right?
[03:56:10.770 --> 03:56:14.010]  You know, Christian's bail is $150,000.
[03:56:14.010 --> 03:56:17.890]  It's a lot of money, but it's not a lot of money.
[03:56:17.890 --> 03:56:21.370]  And like, he can't get to that, right?
[03:56:21.370 --> 03:56:22.210]  Here's the thing, right?
[03:56:22.210 --> 03:56:26.410]  That means somebody is gonna have to fork up $15,000
[03:56:26.410 --> 03:56:28.490]  for him to get out.
[03:56:28.490 --> 03:56:30.930]  And the thing is, he's never gonna see that money again.
[03:56:30.930 --> 03:56:35.010]  Even if he gets off, no charges are brought up against him.
[03:56:35.010 --> 03:56:37.530]  He forfeits a massive amount of money
[03:56:37.530 --> 03:56:39.410]  and he still has to pay that off.
[03:56:39.410 --> 03:56:41.650]  The system is so inherently corrupt,
[03:56:42.830 --> 03:56:44.370]  but it's the institution.
[03:56:44.370 --> 03:56:48.330]  It's the institution that we ourselves are subscribing to
[03:56:48.330 --> 03:56:49.250]  that are causing this
[03:56:49.290 --> 03:56:53.570]  because our only power that we really have are our choices
[03:56:53.570 --> 03:56:55.290]  and our purchasing power.
[03:56:56.130 --> 03:57:00.730]  But again, it's also up to us collectively to like say,
[03:57:00.730 --> 03:57:04.230]  hey, we're fucking, we're done with this
[03:57:04.230 --> 03:57:06.130]  because collective, our power,
[03:57:06.130 --> 03:57:08.850]  our power lies in each other, really.
[03:57:10.330 --> 03:57:15.250]  I can only do so much and it takes effort.
[03:57:15.250 --> 03:57:18.230]  It takes team effort and it takes collective effort
[03:57:18.230 --> 03:57:19.910]  to be able to change these types of things.
[03:57:19.910 --> 03:57:22.870]  California was talking about changing the bail system
[03:57:22.870 --> 03:57:24.310]  while I was incarcerated.
[03:57:24.310 --> 03:57:26.030]  But when you look at it on paper
[03:57:26.030 --> 03:57:28.350]  and you look at the news headlines,
[03:57:28.350 --> 03:57:29.710]  it's all praise and stuff.
[03:57:29.710 --> 03:57:31.490]  But what this allows to do,
[03:57:31.490 --> 03:57:33.530]  it allows for the judge to decide
[03:57:33.530 --> 03:57:35.230]  if you even get to get out.
[03:57:35.230 --> 03:57:36.150]  So it doesn't matter.
[03:57:36.150 --> 03:57:38.390]  They take away the payment system completely.
[03:57:38.390 --> 03:57:39.950]  If you've been incarcerated,
[03:57:39.950 --> 03:57:42.630]  if you're, let's say a homeless person, right?
[03:57:42.630 --> 03:57:44.330]  Or let's say you've been,
[03:57:45.330 --> 03:57:50.330]  you've been gang affiliated and they say,
[03:57:50.450 --> 03:57:51.890]  hey, you're affiliated with a gang
[03:57:51.890 --> 03:57:53.850]  because you're friends with so-and-so and so-and-so.
[03:57:53.850 --> 03:57:55.290]  They do that kind of shit all the time.
[03:57:55.290 --> 03:57:57.190]  Even if you're not in a gang,
[03:57:57.190 --> 03:57:58.970]  they will label you as a gang member
[03:57:58.970 --> 03:58:00.530]  and then they can enhance charges
[03:58:00.530 --> 03:58:02.730]  and do all kinds of fucked up shit, right?
[03:58:02.730 --> 03:58:03.690]  Anything they want.
[03:58:03.690 --> 03:58:06.410]  So let's say you get somebody that's actually innocent.
[03:58:06.410 --> 03:58:07.230]  They didn't commit a crime,
[03:58:07.230 --> 03:58:08.810]  but because he has a past history.
[03:58:08.810 --> 03:58:10.410]  Let's take someone like myself.
[03:58:10.410 --> 03:58:12.850]  Maybe I get in trouble because I have a past history.
[03:58:12.850 --> 03:58:14.330]  I cannot fucking make bail.
[03:58:14.330 --> 03:58:15.210]  You know what that means?
[03:58:15.210 --> 03:58:16.610]  That means I'm fucked.
[03:58:16.610 --> 03:58:18.010]  That means I ain't going to the garden.
[03:58:18.010 --> 03:58:19.090]  It means I ain't going to work.
[03:58:19.090 --> 03:58:20.830]  I ain't taking the kids to school.
[03:58:20.830 --> 03:58:22.530]  I'm not doing anything.
[03:58:22.530 --> 03:58:25.450]  And the systems inherently are designed
[03:58:25.450 --> 03:58:28.050]  to fucking break people.
[03:58:28.050 --> 03:58:29.690]  And then they break them
[03:58:29.690 --> 03:58:31.690]  and they keep them in this fucking system.
[03:58:31.690 --> 03:58:35.970]  And it's the recidivism rate for incarceration
[03:58:35.970 --> 03:58:37.530]  in this country is fucking insane
[03:58:37.530 --> 03:58:40.930]  because it's not about, it's not about rehabilitation.
[03:58:40.930 --> 03:58:43.570]  It's about the economics of incarceration.
[03:58:54.320 --> 03:58:59.320]  By the way, you are the most high-def person on the show.
[03:59:03.080 --> 03:59:07.880]  I'm watching you and I'm like, it's like I'm watching TV.
[03:59:07.880 --> 03:59:09.000]  Well, I-
[03:59:09.000 --> 03:59:12.200]  You got good wifi in Oklahoma.
[03:59:12.200 --> 03:59:13.040]  I love it.
[03:59:13.040 --> 03:59:15.240]  I got Cox Gigablast
[03:59:16.880 --> 03:59:19.320]  because I do these things constantly.
[03:59:19.480 --> 03:59:24.080]  I mean, I do podcasts every week, at least once a week.
[03:59:24.080 --> 03:59:27.800]  So try to have this set up.
[03:59:27.800 --> 03:59:30.560]  But really, I want to give you guys a really good example
[03:59:30.560 --> 03:59:32.200]  so you guys can kind of understand
[03:59:32.200 --> 03:59:35.000]  the way these systems are set up.
[03:59:35.000 --> 03:59:37.280]  And I'm going to give very specific systems
[03:59:37.280 --> 03:59:40.440]  from the places that I've had experience with.
[03:59:40.440 --> 03:59:45.440]  San Diego, California is very, very efficient
[03:59:46.520 --> 03:59:49.000]  at the logistics of incarceration.
[03:59:49.680 --> 03:59:50.520]  And you might be wondering,
[03:59:50.520 --> 03:59:52.080]  what are the logistics of incarceration?
[03:59:52.080 --> 03:59:54.520]  What could those actually be?
[03:59:54.520 --> 03:59:55.840]  And what they do is they set up
[03:59:55.840 --> 03:59:58.200]  institutionalized slave labor.
[03:59:58.200 --> 04:00:01.400]  Now they don't obviously call it institutionalized labor.
[04:00:01.400 --> 04:00:04.520]  They call it inmate work programs, right?
[04:00:04.520 --> 04:00:07.440]  Where you get paid slave labor wages,
[04:00:07.440 --> 04:00:09.680]  you know, 10, 15 cents an hour,
[04:00:10.840 --> 04:00:15.520]  maybe like $3.50 a week to do manual labor jobs,
[04:00:15.520 --> 04:00:17.520]  some up to 40 hours a week.
[04:00:17.520 --> 04:00:19.560]  And the way that they're able to do this is
[04:00:19.560 --> 04:00:21.640]  they build prison systems
[04:00:21.640 --> 04:00:24.440]  where they can house all the commissary.
[04:00:24.440 --> 04:00:28.080]  So they can do commissary for 5,000 inmates in-house
[04:00:28.080 --> 04:00:30.480]  done by inmate labor, okay?
[04:00:30.480 --> 04:00:32.120]  They can do all of the laundry,
[04:00:32.120 --> 04:00:34.400]  all the laundry, not just from a single facility,
[04:00:34.400 --> 04:00:37.440]  but from like nine different county facilities
[04:00:37.440 --> 04:00:38.840]  where they can transport their laundry
[04:00:38.840 --> 04:00:41.880]  and have that all done by, guess what?
[04:00:41.880 --> 04:00:44.080]  Slave fucking labor, okay?
[04:00:44.080 --> 04:00:48.280]  They're able to do this with every single aspect
[04:00:48.280 --> 04:00:49.840]  when it comes to construction.
[04:00:49.840 --> 04:00:51.160]  I worked on the paint crew
[04:00:51.160 --> 04:00:52.840]  and we did all kinds of construction.
[04:00:52.840 --> 04:00:55.000]  We did, no matter what it was,
[04:00:55.000 --> 04:00:57.640]  there was one guy, guess who was doing all the fucking work?
[04:00:57.640 --> 04:00:59.080]  Guys like myself, okay?
[04:00:59.080 --> 04:01:00.160]  I worked in commissary.
[04:01:00.160 --> 04:01:03.760]  I was the lead warehouse inventory.
[04:01:03.760 --> 04:01:06.500]  I brought in all the inventory, did all the backstocking.
[04:01:06.500 --> 04:01:09.120]  I had the highest responsibility for that job.
[04:01:09.120 --> 04:01:11.440]  And I got to see all the ins and outs.
[04:01:11.440 --> 04:01:14.200]  All of these systems are run on inmate slave labor.
[04:01:14.200 --> 04:01:15.800]  And then you have what's called PIA,
[04:01:15.800 --> 04:01:18.600]  Prison Industry Authority, publicly traded,
[04:01:20.400 --> 04:01:22.160]  publicly traded company.
[04:01:22.160 --> 04:01:25.280]  What they do is they do things like they bake cookies
[04:01:25.280 --> 04:01:28.520]  and bread and make glasses and fucking t-shirts
[04:01:28.520 --> 04:01:29.720]  and everything else between.
[04:01:29.720 --> 04:01:32.560]  And they sell those back to the fucking jails.
[04:01:32.560 --> 04:01:35.120]  So all of all the stuff that we couldn't produce
[04:01:35.120 --> 04:01:40.080]  by inmate labor is created by inmate labor,
[04:01:40.080 --> 04:01:41.800]  slave labor from a different prison.
[04:01:41.800 --> 04:01:44.400]  And then it's all transferred and moved around.
[04:01:44.400 --> 04:01:48.560]  So they can inherently keep the costs of everything they do
[04:01:48.560 --> 04:01:52.560]  in these institutions, super fucking low.
[04:01:52.560 --> 04:01:56.440]  In fact, we have so many people incarcerated
[04:01:56.440 --> 04:01:58.140]  in the state of California.
[04:01:58.140 --> 04:02:00.720]  The state openly said,
[04:02:00.720 --> 04:02:04.400]  we're not taking anybody who is not a,
[04:02:04.400 --> 04:02:08.200]  if you're a non-violent offender or a drug offender,
[04:02:08.200 --> 04:02:09.200]  you're not going to prison.
[04:02:09.200 --> 04:02:11.880]  You do not know, you no longer qualify.
[04:02:11.880 --> 04:02:16.560]  Only people who qualify for state prison is sex offenders
[04:02:16.560 --> 04:02:18.340]  and people who have violent crimes, right?
[04:02:18.340 --> 04:02:21.040]  But guess what the San Diego Sheriff Department did?
[04:02:21.040 --> 04:02:22.560]  The people, the Sheriff Department,
[04:02:22.560 --> 04:02:27.180]  meaning remember are the people that are responsible
[04:02:27.180 --> 04:02:30.200]  for protecting our fucking rights, all right?
[04:02:30.200 --> 04:02:33.680]  They are supposed to protect us from police forces,
[04:02:33.680 --> 04:02:35.200]  from military presence,
[04:02:35.200 --> 04:02:39.300]  which are not even allowed to be on our fucking country
[04:02:39.300 --> 04:02:40.760]  in peace time.
[04:02:40.760 --> 04:02:44.000]  But all of our fucking police forces have been militarized.
[04:02:44.000 --> 04:02:46.200]  Okay, we're talking about every time
[04:02:46.200 --> 04:02:47.440]  our rights are taken away,
[04:02:47.440 --> 04:02:49.040]  the sheriffs are the ones that are supposed to be
[04:02:49.040 --> 04:02:51.680]  fucking standing up for us, but that's not what they do.
[04:02:51.680 --> 04:02:56.120]  They have joined the fucking, the enemy and they fucking,
[04:02:56.120 --> 04:02:57.160]  they said, you know what?
[04:02:57.160 --> 04:02:59.720]  We'll take all of these overflow inmates
[04:02:59.720 --> 04:03:00.720]  that you're going to release,
[04:03:00.720 --> 04:03:03.880]  all these non-violent low level drug offenders.
[04:03:03.880 --> 04:03:06.960]  And we will build more fucking county jails.
[04:03:06.960 --> 04:03:10.040]  And now in San Diego, in California,
[04:03:10.040 --> 04:03:14.600]  you can spend up to 10 years in jail on a prison sentence.
[04:03:14.600 --> 04:03:17.020]  They're called a state local prison sentence,
[04:03:17.020 --> 04:03:19.120]  which means you get no fucking state amenities.
[04:03:19.120 --> 04:03:22.460]  You can't hug your fucking kids, no contact visits,
[04:03:22.460 --> 04:03:25.520]  no packages, everything is overpriced.
[04:03:25.520 --> 04:03:28.800]  I mean, we're talking about paying a dollar for a soup,
[04:03:28.800 --> 04:03:31.280]  okay, in these places.
[04:03:31.280 --> 04:03:34.640]  These people are making so fucking much money.
[04:03:34.640 --> 04:03:35.920]  It's fucking sickening.
[04:03:35.920 --> 04:03:38.040]  And the way they do it is they do it
[04:03:38.040 --> 04:03:40.220]  by fucking keeping people poor
[04:03:40.220 --> 04:03:43.600]  and tied in a fucking system that abuses and uses them.
[04:03:49.500 --> 04:03:52.540]  We have Mr. Toad, oh, there he is.
[04:03:58.250 --> 04:04:00.230]  You there, Mr. Toad, can you hear us?
[04:04:02.270 --> 04:04:03.110]  I can.
[04:04:04.350 --> 04:04:05.190]  All right.
[04:04:07.660 --> 04:04:11.580]  So Chad Westport just pointed out
[04:04:11.580 --> 04:04:16.580]  that we're 16 minutes shy of four hours and 20 minutes.
[04:04:16.860 --> 04:04:19.060]  So maybe that would be a good stopping point.
[04:04:19.060 --> 04:04:24.060]  So a topic for the two of you is Johnny
[04:04:26.340 --> 04:04:29.140]  has both of your hazes.
[04:04:29.140 --> 04:04:31.180]  How would you compare and contrast them?
[04:04:31.260 --> 04:04:32.100]  Oh.
[04:04:37.420 --> 04:04:42.140]  Mine, mine does not have,
[04:04:42.140 --> 04:04:45.140]  I believe yours has a skunk or an L5 in it.
[04:04:47.780 --> 04:04:52.780]  Okay, so I have a couple of things as far as the haze goes.
[04:04:52.980 --> 04:04:55.340]  I actually have a lot of haze stuff.
[04:04:55.340 --> 04:04:59.540]  So the stuff, the most recent stuff that I did
[04:04:59.540 --> 04:05:01.060]  was the LimeOne BX.
[04:05:01.060 --> 04:05:02.140]  That was the mail that I used.
[04:05:02.140 --> 04:05:04.860]  It shows us mail out of like 220 mail plants.
[04:05:04.860 --> 04:05:07.100]  It was just a fucking beast.
[04:05:07.940 --> 04:05:11.980]  And it turned out to be just that mean gene line.
[04:05:11.980 --> 04:05:15.700]  I did the TK NL5 haze from AK Bean Brains
[04:05:15.700 --> 04:05:16.900]  that I hit with that.
[04:05:16.900 --> 04:05:19.820]  That turned out phenomenal.
[04:05:19.820 --> 04:05:22.220]  Okay, so I've grown out like NL5 haze.
[04:05:22.220 --> 04:05:24.260]  It takes a really, it has a long flowering time,
[04:05:24.260 --> 04:05:26.620]  but it produces huge
[04:05:26.620 --> 04:05:29.260]  and it's got a great, great terpene profile.
[04:05:29.260 --> 04:05:33.260]  I think I had it, terpene tested at 7.8%
[04:05:33.260 --> 04:05:37.300]  back in like 2016 when I was growing it, right?
[04:05:37.300 --> 04:05:40.500]  That TK NL5 haze times lime,
[04:05:40.500 --> 04:05:42.860]  it has a tighter bud structure.
[04:05:42.860 --> 04:05:46.520]  It has more of like the really tight indica bud structure,
[04:05:46.520 --> 04:05:50.220]  but it stacks really, really tall like the sativa.
[04:05:50.220 --> 04:05:52.460]  It has that really, really front,
[04:05:52.460 --> 04:05:57.460]  that heavy front end lemon pine NL5 haze scent on it.
[04:05:59.860 --> 04:06:01.740]  But it's way more frosty.
[04:06:04.100 --> 04:06:04.940]  So.
[04:06:04.940 --> 04:06:05.780]  Yeah.
[04:06:05.780 --> 04:06:07.540]  And mine's gonna be a lot different
[04:06:07.540 --> 04:06:09.400]  cause it's more open structured.
[04:06:09.400 --> 04:06:10.240]  It's way earlier.
[04:06:10.240 --> 04:06:12.260]  It's before the NL5 was made.
[04:06:12.260 --> 04:06:13.100]  The NL5,
[04:06:16.300 --> 04:06:17.300]  different stuff.
[04:06:17.300 --> 04:06:20.860]  So his is gonna be more towards what everybody believes,
[04:06:20.860 --> 04:06:21.700]  or not believes,
[04:06:21.700 --> 04:06:24.260]  but knows as like the PIF and stuff like that.
[04:06:24.260 --> 04:06:27.860]  The NLTK5, the cough comes out of that line.
[04:06:27.860 --> 04:06:31.620]  There's the Poudre, there would be a Frankie.
[04:06:31.620 --> 04:06:33.900]  All those are like different phenotypes of those crosses
[04:06:33.900 --> 04:06:36.440]  that came out of there, or the devil's haze,
[04:06:36.440 --> 04:06:39.040]  which is the haze NL5 haze crosses.
[04:06:40.060 --> 04:06:42.860]  They're all gonna have a denser bud structure.
[04:06:42.860 --> 04:06:44.980]  They're gonna finish slightly sooner,
[04:06:44.980 --> 04:06:46.620]  but they do have what he's saying,
[04:06:46.620 --> 04:06:48.000]  like that longer spear,
[04:06:48.000 --> 04:06:50.420]  they're gonna produce heavy,
[04:06:50.420 --> 04:06:52.460]  by out crossing to those other plants.
[04:06:52.460 --> 04:06:55.120]  You get magnificent hybrids, man.
[04:06:55.120 --> 04:06:56.540]  That's where the power of those plants come in.
[04:06:56.540 --> 04:06:58.940]  That's where breeding comes into effect.
[04:06:58.940 --> 04:07:02.460]  That's where, even if it's a small selection,
[04:07:02.460 --> 04:07:04.900]  understanding the plant you're adding it to,
[04:07:04.900 --> 04:07:06.380]  and what you're trying to get out of it,
[04:07:06.380 --> 04:07:08.300]  and seeing what comes from it,
[04:07:08.300 --> 04:07:11.140]  you'll understand why people use that haze line.
[04:07:11.140 --> 04:07:13.940]  That plant has got the power to add
[04:07:13.940 --> 04:07:15.580]  a lot of different traits to lines
[04:07:15.580 --> 04:07:17.300]  that don't already have that stuff,
[04:07:17.300 --> 04:07:20.060]  or even anywhere in their gamut tape, man.
[04:07:20.060 --> 04:07:21.340]  It's just not popping out of them.
[04:07:21.340 --> 04:07:23.940]  You cross it one time and start back crossing,
[04:07:23.940 --> 04:07:25.980]  or do another out cross, like to the lime stuff,
[04:07:26.420 --> 04:07:27.820]  the James lime stuff's awesome.
[04:07:27.820 --> 04:07:29.380]  I've got crosses to that stuff.
[04:07:30.260 --> 04:07:32.940]  You're gonna get magnificent hybrids,
[04:07:32.940 --> 04:07:35.620]  and just because they're polys doesn't make them bad.
[04:07:35.620 --> 04:07:39.380]  It makes the, it's like the fruit of the world, right?
[04:07:39.380 --> 04:07:41.020]  There's more than one kind of fucking apple,
[04:07:41.020 --> 04:07:44.220]  and there's one more kind of lemon, right?
[04:07:44.220 --> 04:07:48.100]  Who cares if there's one true breeding line of a lime?
[04:07:48.100 --> 04:07:50.980]  You can find those, but when you buy a pack of seeds,
[04:07:50.980 --> 04:07:53.060]  and then you have the ability to start lime breeding
[04:07:53.060 --> 04:07:56.220]  in a whole new direction based on your own palette,
[04:07:56.220 --> 04:07:59.540]  your own preferences, be they the structure,
[04:07:59.540 --> 04:08:02.140]  maybe you have to have a plant that grows short in your area
[04:08:02.140 --> 04:08:04.500]  so you start selecting for all the smaller plants.
[04:08:04.500 --> 04:08:06.060]  Doesn't make your plant inferior to mine
[04:08:06.060 --> 04:08:08.020]  because I selected for the taller ones.
[04:08:08.020 --> 04:08:10.660]  It just makes my breeding and your breeding different.
[04:08:10.660 --> 04:08:12.100]  Now, if I was breeding for short,
[04:08:12.100 --> 04:08:14.820]  and all mine come out tall, now I'm not breeding correctly.
[04:08:14.820 --> 04:08:16.700]  Now you're chucking shit at shit,
[04:08:16.700 --> 04:08:18.580]  and you're just producing seed stock,
[04:08:18.580 --> 04:08:21.180]  which isn't anything but seed stock.
[04:08:21.180 --> 04:08:22.820]  So that's where breeding and chucking,
[04:08:23.580 --> 04:08:24.860]  we've all chucked, we've all bred.
[04:08:24.860 --> 04:08:27.180]  That's where understanding plants experience comes in.
[04:08:27.180 --> 04:08:28.860]  You're not gonna do it, your first two plants,
[04:08:28.860 --> 04:08:30.060]  your first two pack of seeds,
[04:08:30.060 --> 04:08:33.660]  you're not a breeder of commercial cannabis.
[04:08:33.660 --> 04:08:36.100]  You don't have, what's up Kevin, the brother's in here.
[04:08:36.100 --> 04:08:37.700]  I see him pop up.
[04:08:37.700 --> 04:08:38.540]  Oh, Kevin.
[04:08:38.540 --> 04:08:39.900]  Yeah, ask him if he-
[04:08:39.900 --> 04:08:42.140]  I just sent him a link to come on
[04:08:42.140 --> 04:08:45.100]  and say a quick happy 420 to everyone.
[04:08:45.100 --> 04:08:46.020]  We'll see if he-
[04:08:46.020 --> 04:08:48.220]  Kevin at 420 is a treat for everybody.
[04:08:48.220 --> 04:08:52.780]  He taps on the link on his iPad.
[04:08:53.620 --> 04:08:57.420]  I'm visualizing, he's in his bathrobe, shirtless,
[04:08:57.420 --> 04:08:58.740]  the hair flying.
[04:08:59.900 --> 04:09:04.900]  I have a pack of your Haze for Days that Riley sent me.
[04:09:06.380 --> 04:09:08.500]  He said that he was gonna have problems
[04:09:08.500 --> 04:09:10.300]  with it getting through custom.
[04:09:10.300 --> 04:09:12.100]  So they sent it over to me.
[04:09:12.100 --> 04:09:13.580]  So I got that.
[04:09:13.580 --> 04:09:15.100]  I'll get to it when I can.
[04:09:15.100 --> 04:09:15.940]  I have so much.
[04:09:15.940 --> 04:09:16.780]  I have to enter all,
[04:09:16.780 --> 04:09:19.580]  I have to enter like such a huge seed library
[04:09:19.620 --> 04:09:23.140]  and a metric for my farm by the end of the month.
[04:09:23.140 --> 04:09:24.740]  It's gonna just be a fucking pain in the ass.
[04:09:24.740 --> 04:09:26.340]  Uncle Kev's in here.
[04:09:26.340 --> 04:09:27.300]  It's Uncle Kev.
[04:09:27.300 --> 04:09:28.140]  Hey, what's up, boy?
[04:09:28.140 --> 04:09:28.980]  Hey, what's up, Kev?
[04:09:28.980 --> 04:09:30.820]  What's up, brother?
[04:09:30.820 --> 04:09:32.380]  Hey, baby, happy 420.
[04:09:32.380 --> 04:09:33.220]  Happy 420.
[04:09:33.220 --> 04:09:34.140]  How you doing?
[04:09:34.140 --> 04:09:35.580]  Happy 420.
[04:09:37.460 --> 04:09:38.860]  How's it going, brother?
[04:09:38.860 --> 04:09:39.700]  It's going good.
[04:09:39.700 --> 04:09:40.580]  Just doing some work.
[04:09:40.580 --> 04:09:44.060]  I was just on a meeting and I got to go take off
[04:09:44.060 --> 04:09:46.340]  and meet a team to do some other work.
[04:09:46.340 --> 04:09:47.980]  It's fucking never ending.
[04:09:47.980 --> 04:09:49.560]  But otherwise I'm digging it, man.
[04:09:50.540 --> 04:09:51.440]  I'm looking forward to it.
[04:09:51.440 --> 04:09:54.720]  Spring time is here and I love the conversation on Hayes.
[04:09:54.720 --> 04:09:56.360]  You know, I'm a Hayes freak.
[04:09:56.360 --> 04:09:57.520]  Well, yeah.
[04:09:57.520 --> 04:09:59.480]  Let's hear your thoughts on that.
[04:09:59.480 --> 04:10:02.760]  They've been, and by the way, Elka is traumatized.
[04:10:02.760 --> 04:10:04.680]  He never knew what he was getting into,
[04:10:04.680 --> 04:10:07.520]  a four hour and 10 minute conversation.
[04:10:07.520 --> 04:10:11.600]  He's held it down for four hours and 10 minutes on Hayes.
[04:10:11.600 --> 04:10:12.440]  Oh, I'm good.
[04:10:12.440 --> 04:10:13.640]  It's been fun.
[04:10:13.640 --> 04:10:15.680]  Well, you know the thing with the Hayes is that
[04:10:15.680 --> 04:10:17.120]  what I like about it is that
[04:10:17.160 --> 04:10:21.880]  it has no commercial consideration because it's so long.
[04:10:21.880 --> 04:10:26.880]  And so it's really about, are you about the high?
[04:10:27.080 --> 04:10:28.520]  And are you willing to go?
[04:10:28.520 --> 04:10:32.200]  And so to me, I think Hayes is one of the varieties
[04:10:32.200 --> 04:10:36.560]  that will always live within the heady kind of cats.
[04:10:36.560 --> 04:10:38.360]  Because it's, you know, for me,
[04:10:38.360 --> 04:10:40.080]  when I was doing all the Hayes work,
[04:10:40.080 --> 04:10:43.380]  142 days was the longest I ran them out to
[04:10:43.380 --> 04:10:44.660]  when I was doing it.
[04:10:44.660 --> 04:10:47.100]  Nobody fucking runs 140 days stuff.
[04:10:47.100 --> 04:10:47.940]  Yeah.
[04:10:50.340 --> 04:10:54.180]  But I was fascinated with that ethereal high
[04:10:54.180 --> 04:10:56.300]  and I wanted to go through the populations
[04:10:56.300 --> 04:11:00.280]  and I had the ability to do so.
[04:11:00.280 --> 04:11:03.140]  And I think it was something that almost all cultivators
[04:11:03.140 --> 04:11:07.500]  have to experience where you have to learn patience
[04:11:07.500 --> 04:11:08.980]  and plant manipulation.
[04:11:08.980 --> 04:11:10.300]  Because if you shoot a Hayes,
[04:11:10.300 --> 04:11:13.340]  you have to cut it back about 15 times.
[04:11:13.340 --> 04:11:16.940]  Otherwise 17 fucking feet in your house.
[04:11:16.940 --> 04:11:17.860]  Yeah.
[04:11:17.860 --> 04:11:19.540]  They're unbelievably aggressive.
[04:11:19.540 --> 04:11:22.700]  And you have to learn how to appreciate it.
[04:11:22.700 --> 04:11:26.340]  And it was funny because I hooked up with this Colombian
[04:11:26.340 --> 04:11:31.260]  and he was a collector of stuff all over South America.
[04:11:31.260 --> 04:11:36.260]  But we talked about the pollution
[04:11:36.580 --> 04:11:40.180]  from non-ethnic varieties and how that
[04:11:40.180 --> 04:11:44.660]  if you really want to experience the lucidity of a Hayes,
[04:11:44.660 --> 04:11:49.140]  you have to basically go on like a 10 day, two week cleanse,
[04:11:49.140 --> 04:11:51.400]  cleanse your body of all cannabinoids
[04:11:51.400 --> 04:11:53.260]  from other types of plant.
[04:11:53.260 --> 04:11:56.180]  And then you can get into the Hayes world.
[04:11:56.180 --> 04:11:57.980]  And he was right.
[04:11:57.980 --> 04:12:01.620]  There's something that muddles the high.
[04:12:01.620 --> 04:12:04.340]  And when you start to get into it and you're clean,
[04:12:04.340 --> 04:12:07.580]  now you can allow your body to steer it
[04:12:07.580 --> 04:12:11.500]  through the cannabinoid pathways that the Hayes provides.
[04:12:11.500 --> 04:12:13.700]  And the upper end of it was incredible.
[04:12:13.700 --> 04:12:15.500]  Zero ceiling.
[04:12:15.500 --> 04:12:18.100]  I mean, the more you smoke, the higher you got,
[04:12:18.100 --> 04:12:20.380]  the more energy you felt.
[04:12:20.380 --> 04:12:22.860]  And the more you were looking out your window.
[04:12:24.020 --> 04:12:24.860]  Yeah.
[04:12:24.860 --> 04:12:25.700]  Yeah.
[04:12:25.700 --> 04:12:26.540]  Yeah.
[04:12:26.540 --> 04:12:27.380]  Yeah.
[04:12:27.380 --> 04:12:28.540]  And so, I love it.
[04:12:28.540 --> 04:12:31.380]  And I like the fact that there's a resurgence of it.
[04:12:31.380 --> 04:12:35.340]  I want to say BAM is doing a project at a greenhouse
[04:12:35.340 --> 04:12:40.340]  in Central Cal where they're doing a big A5, C5.
[04:12:40.360 --> 04:12:41.860]  They're doing a PIF Hayes.
[04:12:41.860 --> 04:12:45.020]  He's doing a whole bunch of different hunts at a large scale
[04:12:45.020 --> 04:12:47.300]  and trying to find something that maybe comes in
[04:12:47.300 --> 04:12:49.260]  in that hundred day range.
[04:12:49.260 --> 04:12:51.540]  That's a little bit more acceptable
[04:12:51.540 --> 04:12:53.500]  for hopefully the market.
[04:12:53.500 --> 04:12:55.820]  But the same thing is a lot of the Hayes
[04:12:55.820 --> 04:12:59.980]  is they don't hold up well through the new supply chain
[04:12:59.980 --> 04:13:01.920]  because they're fragile.
[04:13:01.920 --> 04:13:04.920]  And they don't do well with mechanized trimming
[04:13:05.440 --> 04:13:08.160]  and they don't do well with the movement
[04:13:08.160 --> 04:13:09.800]  through the supply chain.
[04:13:09.800 --> 04:13:12.080]  And so to me, some of the Hayes is really where like,
[04:13:12.080 --> 04:13:13.800]  it's the last of the real heads, you know,
[04:13:13.800 --> 04:13:17.200]  where if you got the real stuff, you got the real stuff,
[04:13:17.200 --> 04:13:19.180]  it's limited supply.
[04:13:24.280 --> 04:13:25.380]  You're muted, Brandon.
[04:13:28.580 --> 04:13:32.200]  The last, the first round that we did in our greenhouses,
[04:13:32.200 --> 04:13:36.580]  we did a big pheno hunt and I popped a bunch of Hayes stuff
[04:13:36.580 --> 04:13:38.380]  that from 20 year old seed stock.
[04:13:38.380 --> 04:13:41.100]  And I mean, they have massive frames.
[04:13:41.100 --> 04:13:45.940]  These, all the stuff, all the older stuff, beasts.
[04:13:45.940 --> 04:13:49.780]  You know, they want it, they feed heavier, they get bigger.
[04:13:49.780 --> 04:13:51.980]  But it's just like you're saying,
[04:13:51.980 --> 04:13:56.980]  nobody nowadays is looking at weed.
[04:13:57.280 --> 04:13:59.740]  And, you know, really everybody is just,
[04:13:59.740 --> 04:14:01.180]  they want this bag appeal.
[04:14:01.180 --> 04:14:04.420]  I mean, the prettier it is, that's, it's the market.
[04:14:04.420 --> 04:14:08.140]  The market, man, you know, when we started this whole thing,
[04:14:08.940 --> 04:14:09.780]  we were like, we're going to pheno hunt,
[04:14:09.780 --> 04:14:10.780]  find some really good stuff.
[04:14:10.780 --> 04:14:13.740]  We went back to that old stuff because that's, you know,
[04:14:13.740 --> 04:14:15.700]  we grew all that stuff back in the day.
[04:14:15.700 --> 04:14:19.020]  And now we don't, we don't see it.
[04:14:19.020 --> 04:14:20.540]  And we wanted to see if there was something
[04:14:20.540 --> 04:14:21.820]  that we could pull out of it.
[04:14:21.820 --> 04:14:24.460]  And we didn't end up pulling a thing out of it, you know,
[04:14:24.460 --> 04:14:26.220]  out of that pheno hunt from those varieties,
[04:14:26.220 --> 04:14:30.380]  because, you know, we have to cultivate for the market
[04:14:30.380 --> 04:14:32.980]  and better yet, we were trying to fulfill deficits
[04:14:32.980 --> 04:14:33.820]  in the market.
[04:14:33.820 --> 04:14:35.940]  So at the time there's a deficit in rosin,
[04:14:35.940 --> 04:14:40.540]  and that's what we want to, oh shit, it's 420.
[04:14:40.540 --> 04:14:41.380]  Yeah, yeah.
[04:14:42.700 --> 04:14:44.260]  Yeah, 420 everybody.
[04:14:44.260 --> 04:14:45.100]  Awesome.
[04:14:47.260 --> 04:14:49.020]  No, it's the truth of it.
[04:14:49.020 --> 04:14:51.580]  And even when you're going through the populations,
[04:14:51.580 --> 04:14:52.460]  yo, what's up, man?
[04:14:52.460 --> 04:14:54.380]  We were just talking about you bringing on all that,
[04:14:54.380 --> 04:14:56.420]  all that killer haze work.
[04:14:56.420 --> 04:14:57.380]  What's that?
[04:14:57.380 --> 04:14:58.220]  Yeah, yeah.
[04:14:58.220 --> 04:15:00.740]  I was just bringing up, I've been following your work
[04:15:00.740 --> 04:15:02.740]  on all the different hazes and the pips.
[04:15:03.300 --> 04:15:06.220]  And I'm just fascinated because I think
[04:15:06.220 --> 04:15:08.540]  you're the only person, I think maybe you and Jord,
[04:15:08.540 --> 04:15:12.900]  I think Jord is involved in a big hunt too,
[04:15:12.900 --> 04:15:16.540]  through with Radio Ridge, through with Eva,
[04:15:16.540 --> 04:15:18.180]  chasing the old stock.
[04:15:19.140 --> 04:15:22.460]  And I love it because it is a purity to it.
[04:15:22.460 --> 04:15:26.100]  That's just, you can't, it's not about the market.
[04:15:26.100 --> 04:15:28.660]  It's about that type of cannabis.
[04:15:29.860 --> 04:15:30.700]  Yeah.
[04:15:30.700 --> 04:15:31.540]  And I think that over time, you know,
[04:15:31.540 --> 04:15:35.180]  hopefully the population that smokes realizes that,
[04:15:35.180 --> 04:15:36.700]  you know, some of that stuff,
[04:15:36.700 --> 04:15:41.260]  there's a high to it that you cannot get anywhere else.
[04:15:41.260 --> 04:15:42.620]  Yeah, and it's a high that like,
[04:15:42.620 --> 04:15:44.780]  isn't quantified on test results.
[04:15:44.780 --> 04:15:45.620]  No.
[04:15:45.620 --> 04:15:48.580]  No packaging, right?
[04:15:48.580 --> 04:15:51.940]  Like not necessarily a big C.
[04:15:51.940 --> 04:15:53.900]  But then, you know, that kind of stuff comes
[04:15:53.900 --> 04:15:56.020]  with educating your consumer.
[04:15:56.020 --> 04:15:58.740]  And that is, that can be really difficult too,
[04:15:58.740 --> 04:16:01.220]  because although there's always new people
[04:16:01.900 --> 04:16:02.940]  that are coming in and smoking,
[04:16:02.940 --> 04:16:06.020]  it's like trying to set up programs
[04:16:06.020 --> 04:16:08.820]  to where you can educate your bud tender,
[04:16:08.820 --> 04:16:11.500]  so that way they can educate the consumer.
[04:16:11.500 --> 04:16:13.660]  And a lot of people, again, they come in there
[04:16:13.660 --> 04:16:16.460]  and they're like, they look at high THC
[04:16:16.460 --> 04:16:18.980]  and they look at what's prettiest.
[04:16:18.980 --> 04:16:21.740]  That was like the whole thing with the Gandhia program,
[04:16:21.740 --> 04:16:24.580]  which is really about being able to understand,
[04:16:24.580 --> 04:16:26.900]  you're evaluating the product,
[04:16:26.900 --> 04:16:29.700]  not from a commercial consideration first.
[04:16:30.620 --> 04:16:32.500]  Commercial consideration is part of it
[04:16:32.500 --> 04:16:33.620]  if you're trying to sell it,
[04:16:33.620 --> 04:16:36.540]  but the bottom line is good grass is good grass
[04:16:36.540 --> 04:16:39.500]  and fucking great grass can only be quantified
[04:16:39.500 --> 04:16:41.100]  by an individual experience.
[04:16:42.220 --> 04:16:43.220]  No numbers cover it.
[04:16:44.380 --> 04:16:47.060]  I think that we're gonna see more of a change
[04:16:47.060 --> 04:16:51.540]  in consumer education once we've opened up the market
[04:16:51.540 --> 04:16:53.420]  a little bit more here in California,
[04:16:53.420 --> 04:16:54.900]  not enough retailers.
[04:16:54.900 --> 04:16:57.980]  So it's not really, there's no incentive for them
[04:16:57.980 --> 04:17:01.220]  to educate consumers.
[04:17:01.220 --> 04:17:05.860]  It's like when we up the competition within that space,
[04:17:05.860 --> 04:17:07.260]  that's when we're gonna,
[04:17:07.260 --> 04:17:09.660]  that's when your real differentiation
[04:17:09.660 --> 04:17:12.180]  is gonna come in your ability to educate
[04:17:12.180 --> 04:17:13.780]  and cultivate the consumer.
[04:17:13.780 --> 04:17:15.700]  What I mean by cultivating the consumer
[04:17:15.700 --> 04:17:18.100]  is leveling them up and like teaching them
[04:17:18.100 --> 04:17:19.580]  and educating them so that they know
[04:17:19.580 --> 04:17:21.780]  how to make wise choices.
[04:17:21.780 --> 04:17:24.820]  And the catch 22 there is that when you build
[04:17:24.820 --> 04:17:28.020]  an educated consumer, you make your job harder,
[04:17:28.020 --> 04:17:28.860]  but guess what?
[04:17:28.860 --> 04:17:30.500]  If you're the one setting the bar,
[04:17:30.500 --> 04:17:33.860]  your job's actually gonna be easier in the long run.
[04:17:33.860 --> 04:17:36.420]  Moving the bar forward and constantly leveling up
[04:17:36.420 --> 04:17:40.220]  your consumers, then you're gonna get to a point
[04:17:40.220 --> 04:17:43.620]  where they no longer care to check elsewhere
[04:17:43.620 --> 04:17:46.260]  because they're not getting the same level of service.
[04:17:46.260 --> 04:17:48.820]  I think education is a huge component
[04:17:48.820 --> 04:17:52.060]  of like customer service that is so often overlooked
[04:17:52.060 --> 04:17:55.660]  and undervalued in the distorted market
[04:17:55.660 --> 04:17:56.980]  that we currently have.
[04:17:56.980 --> 04:17:59.300]  Oh yeah, well, it's so, they did such a job,
[04:17:59.300 --> 04:18:01.580]  you know, ripping the system apart
[04:18:01.580 --> 04:18:05.460]  that there's almost no diversity within it.
[04:18:05.460 --> 04:18:08.900]  And it was so effective that it's changed
[04:18:08.900 --> 04:18:10.740]  the entire paradigm and we have,
[04:18:10.740 --> 04:18:12.820]  and the only thing that's a solid part
[04:18:12.820 --> 04:18:17.420]  is that the consumptive groups still exist in huge form.
[04:18:17.420 --> 04:18:20.020]  So it's not hard to have this conversation
[04:18:20.020 --> 04:18:21.620]  with older consumers.
[04:18:22.140 --> 04:18:23.940]  It's the newer consumers that you wanna be able
[04:18:23.940 --> 04:18:25.580]  to start to say, hey, listen,
[04:18:25.580 --> 04:18:28.020]  there was a lot more choice previously.
[04:18:28.020 --> 04:18:29.780]  We had many options.
[04:18:29.780 --> 04:18:31.900]  We had much different access.
[04:18:31.900 --> 04:18:34.940]  Niche producers produce things in small batch
[04:18:34.940 --> 04:18:37.900]  that you could only access in limited release.
[04:18:37.900 --> 04:18:41.820]  And it forced you to stay more involved in those releases
[04:18:41.820 --> 04:18:43.860]  so you'd make sure you could catch it.
[04:18:43.860 --> 04:18:47.940]  So it created a much more intimate relationship
[04:18:47.940 --> 04:18:50.740]  between store and consumer.
[04:18:50.740 --> 04:18:53.580]  And now it's just go in and buy whatever's there.
[04:18:53.580 --> 04:18:56.700]  And you know, you don't knock people's buying habits,
[04:18:56.700 --> 04:18:58.460]  but when you're having to convince people
[04:18:58.460 --> 04:19:03.060]  that equatorial thinly are valid,
[04:19:03.060 --> 04:19:04.020]  I laugh because I'm like,
[04:19:04.020 --> 04:19:06.980]  oh, you obviously never smoked any real Colombian.
[04:19:06.980 --> 04:19:07.980]  Yeah.
[04:19:07.980 --> 04:19:10.500]  Because I mean, it's almost making you question
[04:19:10.500 --> 04:19:12.420]  like your own reality.
[04:19:12.420 --> 04:19:15.780]  And you need that in the form
[04:19:15.780 --> 04:19:19.940]  because the expansiveness of cannabis
[04:19:19.980 --> 04:19:22.220]  has to be shown its entirety
[04:19:22.220 --> 04:19:24.980]  because it reflects human being choice.
[04:19:24.980 --> 04:19:26.780]  We wouldn't have so many choices
[04:19:26.780 --> 04:19:29.820]  if humans hadn't cultivated it globally.
[04:19:29.820 --> 04:19:32.740]  So for millennia, people made these choices.
[04:19:32.740 --> 04:19:35.340]  And then all of a sudden we make no choice.
[04:19:35.340 --> 04:19:36.540]  And it's, you know, to me,
[04:19:36.540 --> 04:19:38.940]  it's always trying to push that back into the mainstream
[04:19:38.940 --> 04:19:41.900]  of like, look, these things were chosen for centuries
[04:19:41.900 --> 04:19:43.220]  for a reason.
[04:19:43.220 --> 04:19:45.860]  The people that chose them were not less intelligent
[04:19:45.860 --> 04:19:47.540]  but not using cannabis than you.
[04:19:47.540 --> 04:19:49.140]  They were far more intelligent.
[04:19:50.100 --> 04:19:51.060]  They lived with it.
[04:19:52.500 --> 04:19:56.740]  I think that we're seeing like a kind of a renaissance
[04:19:56.740 --> 04:19:57.580]  in the market now,
[04:19:57.580 --> 04:19:59.860]  because I think that we're seeing more brands
[04:19:59.860 --> 04:20:02.100]  that are open to this education effort.
[04:20:02.100 --> 04:20:04.140]  And I think as producers,
[04:20:04.140 --> 04:20:06.420]  it's really important that we take that role.
[04:20:06.420 --> 04:20:08.940]  And like, we don't have the direct connection
[04:20:08.940 --> 04:20:12.780]  to the consumers because of the chain of customs
[04:20:12.780 --> 04:20:15.980]  happens between distribution and production.
[04:20:15.980 --> 04:20:19.820]  But it's a great opportunity for us as producers
[04:20:20.700 --> 04:20:21.780]  to educate level up brands
[04:20:21.780 --> 04:20:25.060]  because they're going to be the ones that interface.
[04:20:25.060 --> 04:20:27.700]  It's almost like trickle down marketing, right?
[04:20:27.700 --> 04:20:31.260]  You educate the brands and then you educate the distro
[04:20:31.260 --> 04:20:33.940]  so that they educate the retail,
[04:20:33.940 --> 04:20:36.220]  which winds up in the consumer.
[04:20:36.220 --> 04:20:38.860]  But tenders are definitely the key to that.
[04:20:38.860 --> 04:20:41.460]  I have to say, I feel super blessed
[04:20:41.460 --> 04:20:43.380]  because for this Hayes Project,
[04:20:43.380 --> 04:20:46.540]  we found a brand that believed in the vision.
[04:20:46.540 --> 04:20:47.700]  And how did that happen?
[04:20:48.700 --> 04:20:50.940]  And I happened to share some of the pictures
[04:20:50.940 --> 04:20:52.900]  and I was like, hey, try this.
[04:20:52.900 --> 04:20:56.060]  And they were like, whoa, you know,
[04:20:56.060 --> 04:21:01.060]  and it was a complete shift in paradigm
[04:21:01.780 --> 04:21:03.700]  in terms of metrics and specs
[04:21:03.700 --> 04:21:05.940]  that a lot of brands are looking for,
[04:21:05.940 --> 04:21:07.900]  but proof's in the pudding, right?
[04:21:07.900 --> 04:21:11.860]  So when you've rolled it up, light it up, smoke it up,
[04:21:11.860 --> 04:21:14.340]  you're going to know that it's the truth.
[04:21:14.340 --> 04:21:15.940]  And I think that it's really important
[04:21:16.020 --> 04:21:18.860]  that all of us as producers take that time
[04:21:18.860 --> 04:21:21.620]  and that effort to level up the people
[04:21:21.620 --> 04:21:23.860]  that we can directly connect with,
[04:21:23.860 --> 04:21:27.660]  the ones that we are able to affect some change in.
[04:21:27.660 --> 04:21:29.540]  It felt hopeless to me at first,
[04:21:29.540 --> 04:21:33.300]  but you gotta keep the faith.
[04:21:33.300 --> 04:21:37.020]  Oh, no, for real, it's us that are the career lunatics.
[04:21:38.740 --> 04:21:41.020]  We went as deep as we could go
[04:21:41.020 --> 04:21:43.140]  and we just want to see people be able to enjoy
[04:21:43.180 --> 04:21:45.780]  what we enjoyed, which was incredible diversity.
[04:21:46.660 --> 04:21:48.940]  I think that was the gift that I got all these years
[04:21:48.940 --> 04:21:50.780]  was I got to see so much diversity.
[04:21:50.780 --> 04:21:54.980]  And I just realized that the compression of that
[04:21:54.980 --> 04:21:58.020]  destroys the development in the future.
[04:21:58.020 --> 04:21:59.860]  And without the preservation,
[04:21:59.860 --> 04:22:01.340]  we're like now we're trying to go back
[04:22:01.340 --> 04:22:03.460]  and find all these things we lost.
[04:22:03.460 --> 04:22:05.540]  This shit should never been lost.
[04:22:06.980 --> 04:22:08.180]  It should never been lost.
[04:22:08.180 --> 04:22:10.420]  But listen, I just wanted to jump on real fast
[04:22:10.420 --> 04:22:13.100]  and say, hi, I got to bounce.
[04:22:14.060 --> 04:22:18.340]  So just quickly, let's end it on that
[04:22:18.340 --> 04:22:22.060]  because I just wanted to get to our 420
[04:22:22.060 --> 04:22:25.580]  and we were now at four hours and 22 minutes in.
[04:22:25.580 --> 04:22:30.580]  And I've been sitting in the garage
[04:22:30.860 --> 04:22:32.820]  for four hours and 20 minutes
[04:22:32.820 --> 04:22:36.180]  and seeing the sun would be a nice thing today.
[04:22:36.180 --> 04:22:37.780]  And I got to come back on later.
[04:22:37.780 --> 04:22:41.060]  My friend James Lake's gonna rock out
[04:22:41.060 --> 04:22:42.300]  on the guitar tonight.
[04:22:42.300 --> 04:22:45.540]  So maybe we'll pull some of you guys back.
[04:22:45.540 --> 04:22:49.060]  Hey Kevin, go check your mailbox.
[04:22:49.060 --> 04:22:51.060]  Yup, yup, should be in, right on bro.
[04:22:52.100 --> 04:22:53.660]  Happy 420 everybody.
[04:22:53.660 --> 04:22:54.660]  Happy 420.
[04:22:55.660 --> 04:22:56.500]  Bamblam.
[04:22:58.020 --> 04:22:58.860]  Thanks for joining.
[04:22:58.860 --> 04:22:59.700]  You look like you're coming
[04:22:59.700 --> 04:23:02.100]  from an archeological dig or something.
[04:23:02.100 --> 04:23:04.580]  Bro, I'm in the greenhouse taking a nap.
[04:23:04.580 --> 04:23:08.500]  This is my sun cap.
[04:23:09.380 --> 04:23:10.220]  All right.
[04:23:10.220 --> 04:23:12.940]  So with that, everyone have a good one
[04:23:12.940 --> 04:23:16.740]  and I'll be back a little bit later.
[04:23:16.740 --> 04:23:19.420]  And Bam, let's get you back on sometime soon
[04:23:19.420 --> 04:23:21.420]  talking about what you've been up to.
[04:23:21.420 --> 04:23:22.260]  I would love to.
[04:23:22.260 --> 04:23:24.660]  All your mad exploration of,
[04:23:25.900 --> 04:23:29.660]  I keep seeing pictures of like seas of clones.
[04:23:29.660 --> 04:23:30.780]  Yeah, yeah.
[04:23:30.780 --> 04:23:34.300]  And if you're ever in the area, man,
[04:23:34.300 --> 04:23:36.940]  I'd love to give you an intimate tour.
[04:23:36.940 --> 04:23:39.300]  You wanna do a show on some of this stuff.
[04:23:39.500 --> 04:23:40.740]  It's legendary, dude.
[04:23:40.740 --> 04:23:44.860]  I can't tell you how excited I am about what's going on.
[04:23:44.860 --> 04:23:47.660]  And like the team that I'm on is fucking awesome.
[04:23:47.660 --> 04:23:48.500]  They like-
[04:23:48.500 --> 04:23:51.300]  I'm psyched that you're fired up
[04:23:51.300 --> 04:23:52.580]  doing what you're doing right now.
[04:23:52.580 --> 04:23:53.660]  I'm happy that you,
[04:23:55.020 --> 04:23:58.100]  even though how long is your daily commute?
[04:23:58.100 --> 04:23:58.940]  No, no, no.
[04:23:58.940 --> 04:23:59.780]  You know what?
[04:23:59.780 --> 04:24:00.780]  I actually live down here now.
[04:24:00.780 --> 04:24:01.620]  Oh, fuck yeah.
[04:24:01.620 --> 04:24:03.340]  All right, that's awesome.
[04:24:03.340 --> 04:24:05.060]  And I live down here.
[04:24:05.060 --> 04:24:06.140]  So, but you know what?
[04:24:06.140 --> 04:24:07.620]  Even if I still had to commute,
[04:24:07.620 --> 04:24:09.820]  it would all be worth it.
[04:24:09.820 --> 04:24:10.740]  Right.
[04:24:10.740 --> 04:24:13.860]  Just like the stuff that dreams are made of, man.
[04:24:13.860 --> 04:24:16.260]  No, but that's, I mean, you're loving it.
[04:24:16.260 --> 04:24:17.820]  You're with people you like
[04:24:17.820 --> 04:24:21.140]  and your commute's not like two and a half hours
[04:24:21.140 --> 04:24:22.380]  each way anymore.
[04:24:22.380 --> 04:24:23.220]  So.
[04:24:23.220 --> 04:24:24.460]  Exactly.
[04:24:24.460 --> 04:24:25.780]  I'm happy to hear that.
[04:24:25.780 --> 04:24:29.380]  But Mr. Toad, thank you as well.
[04:24:29.380 --> 04:24:32.580]  And with that, why don't we call it
[04:24:32.620 --> 04:24:36.540]  and everybody have a good next couple hours
[04:24:36.540 --> 04:24:39.580]  and I'll be right back here later.
[04:24:39.580 --> 04:24:41.220]  Happy 420, y'all.
[04:24:41.220 --> 04:24:42.180]  See ya.
