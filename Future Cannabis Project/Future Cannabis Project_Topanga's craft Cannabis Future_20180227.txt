[00:00.000 --> 00:23.800]  The Panga Canyon is an unincorporated area, very well known, I think within the cannabis
[00:23.800 --> 00:25.200]  space itself as well too.
[00:25.200 --> 00:28.280]  Everyone kind of hasn't understood that there are growers there.
[00:28.280 --> 00:30.080]  People grow for their own personal use or otherwise.
[00:30.080 --> 00:34.280]  It's been historically done there and it's a great location for all that.
[00:34.280 --> 00:37.920]  What's been surprising to us in a very positive way is that that community, when we look at
[00:37.920 --> 00:43.680]  that voting data, the community was actually at 76% in favor of Prop 64 passing.
[00:43.800 --> 00:49.480]  By far, they were one of the highest rated communities in favor of legal cannabis there.
[00:49.480 --> 00:54.200]  However, the way the current zoning is set up, their supervisor who represents them,
[00:54.200 --> 00:57.880]  Supervisor Sheila Kuehl, who is very favorable to the topic.
[00:57.880 --> 00:59.720]  She has always been favorable.
[00:59.720 --> 01:01.720]  She wants to see a regulated market.
[01:01.720 --> 01:07.320]  However, she has not had a very loud voice in this discussion because the zoning has
[01:07.320 --> 01:12.080]  made it so that her district essentially would only have the ability to have only one dispensary
[01:12.080 --> 01:14.080]  in the entire district for her.
[01:14.080 --> 01:17.080]  And no cultivation and no...
[01:17.080 --> 01:19.080]  Cultivation, it would be hard to find anything else on there.
[01:19.080 --> 01:23.160]  The entire Topanga Canyon area, all that stuff in there, there is no zoning that is allowed
[01:23.160 --> 01:26.960]  for any commercial cannabis use, indoor, outdoor, you name it.
[01:26.960 --> 01:31.840]  This is an example where the town council started getting in the ear of the county board
[01:31.840 --> 01:37.120]  of supervisors saying, hey, we would like either indoor or outdoor cultivation in the
[01:37.120 --> 01:43.800]  Topanga area that maybe the board of supervisors would start to listen to them.
[01:43.800 --> 01:51.360]  It seems like the current policy is all cannabis cultivation in this little tiny needle pin
[01:51.360 --> 01:54.080]  sized area of the entire county.
[01:54.080 --> 01:55.800]  That's where it's all going to happen.
[01:55.800 --> 02:00.840]  And what we need is people in different areas saying, hey, we'd like it in our area too.
[02:00.840 --> 02:04.520]  And by the way, we also like to do greenhouse or outdoor.
[02:04.920 --> 02:10.400]  It's really important because if that town council could voice that opinion more strongly
[02:10.400 --> 02:16.240]  to Supervisor Kuehl, she would be even more encouraged to support expanding and actually
[02:16.240 --> 02:18.400]  having a viable cannabis market.
[02:18.400 --> 02:21.400]  I think right now what they have proposed is not a viable market.
[02:21.400 --> 02:25.840]  There's also the contrast to where you have certain town councils that have people that
[02:25.840 --> 02:28.960]  sit on them that are conservative, have based their opinion and they voice that opinion,
[02:28.960 --> 02:32.480]  but it doesn't reflect what the actual voting data is for the area.
[02:32.480 --> 02:37.560]  So Topanga Canyons Town Council has decided that they've had this discussion previously
[02:37.560 --> 02:41.040]  last year when we went out to do an opportunity to speak with them.
[02:41.040 --> 02:43.520]  They spoke about it for about an hour on the thing.
[02:43.520 --> 02:45.960]  And since that time, they backed away and said, great, there's not going to be anything
[02:45.960 --> 02:47.320]  happening here.
[02:47.320 --> 02:51.000]  I don't see that that is reflecting the will of what the residents are there.
[02:51.000 --> 02:53.600]  And the residents are the ones that need to show them that this is something they want.
[02:53.600 --> 02:56.640]  They need to go to their town council and they need to talk to them and say, we voted
[02:56.640 --> 02:57.640]  for this thing.
[02:57.640 --> 03:00.440]  If we don't do this, there are parents that can be separated from their children.
[03:00.440 --> 03:04.120]  There can be so many other consequences on their stuff if they are continuing to do their
[03:04.120 --> 03:07.320]  grows because the laws no longer support them to do that.
[03:07.320 --> 03:12.400]  I think of some people we both know in Topanga, people started saying, hey, town council,
[03:12.400 --> 03:16.080]  I'd like to have a consumption lounge.
[03:16.080 --> 03:18.920]  I'd like to have a cottage cultivation license.
[03:18.920 --> 03:25.760]  I'd like to be the guy to have the medical and or recreational dispensary somewhere on
[03:25.760 --> 03:28.920]  Route 27.
[03:28.920 --> 03:36.040]  If those people all started getting vocal, then the town council would start to listen,
[03:36.040 --> 03:41.760]  get educated, turn to the board of supervisors and say things like, hey, there's 10 retail
[03:41.760 --> 03:47.520]  licenses, either one we want, one in Topanga, or you got to up it to 11 because we want
[03:47.520 --> 03:52.040]  to have a consumption and a retail establishment in Topanga.
[03:52.040 --> 03:57.080]  So Topanga Canyon itself, there is so much opportunity there.
[03:57.120 --> 03:58.920]  It's not even just the opportunity that's addressing.
[03:58.920 --> 04:04.800]  There is obviously a market that has been in existence there for a while, personal or
[04:04.800 --> 04:06.880]  otherwise going in there.
[04:06.880 --> 04:08.000]  The climate is excellent.
[04:08.000 --> 04:12.240]  The land is excellent for cultivation, again, personal or commercial going in there.
[04:12.240 --> 04:16.840]  Perhaps not to where you will have acres and acres of a grow, but this is where you have
[04:16.840 --> 04:19.920]  something such as a cottage license that can come into effect.
[04:19.920 --> 04:23.080]  The state had allowed for what's called a cottage license that was really kind of more
[04:23.080 --> 04:27.920]  intended for, I think, almost like a garage size grow.
[04:27.920 --> 04:31.840]  And so someone that could grow necessarily on their property with the right parameters
[04:31.840 --> 04:35.760]  that would go with that, those parameters are still to be determined and can be determined
[04:35.760 --> 04:37.840]  by the county as well too.
[04:37.840 --> 04:42.160]  We saw that as something that could be a very good stimulus to the economy in general within
[04:42.160 --> 04:43.160]  the county.
[04:43.160 --> 04:47.240]  So we made the committee, the committee had made a recommendation saying that the county
[04:47.240 --> 04:52.200]  should prioritize cottage licenses and see if they could get more of those online because
[04:52.320 --> 04:56.160]  it would give smaller people an opportunity to actually have a living for that.
[04:56.160 --> 05:00.920]  So you have somewhere like the Panga Canyon that you could have 30, 40 individual smaller
[05:00.920 --> 05:04.880]  farmers that could come together or whatever they want to do on that end and actually make
[05:04.880 --> 05:09.280]  a market up there and a business that could be supporting both the community or going
[05:09.280 --> 05:11.160]  beyond that.
[05:11.160 --> 05:14.040]  But that's just one license type, obviously.
[05:14.040 --> 05:20.120]  But the example there is, let's say, hypothetically, I live in Topanga, I have four acres.
[05:20.120 --> 05:26.960]  On my four acres, I could apply for a permit, get a license, put the security in place and
[05:26.960 --> 05:32.200]  all that stuff and basically grow 1,500 square feet of cannabis on my property.
[05:32.200 --> 05:33.200]  Legally.
[05:33.200 --> 05:34.200]  Legally.
[05:34.200 --> 05:41.120]  Where then I could theoretically bring it to the one retail outlet in Topanga, sell
[05:41.120 --> 05:48.080]  it to them as my finest craft cannabis, and then they sell it to my overall community
[05:48.160 --> 05:53.480]  who loves the fact that it's local, outdoor, organic, heirloom craft cannabis.
[05:53.480 --> 05:58.480]  That is a...
[05:58.480 --> 06:02.600]  It's a very real market that can exist there that the current regulations do not support
[06:02.600 --> 06:04.280]  or allow for in any way, shape or form.
[06:04.280 --> 06:07.840]  So Topanga Canyon could be known very well for a craft style cannabis.
[06:07.840 --> 06:12.160]  They could be known for a farmer's market kind of event as well there too.
[06:12.160 --> 06:15.160]  It could be something there where you can promote really healthy product along with
[06:15.160 --> 06:19.920]  the healthy lifestyle that many of the residents up there are already into, of course.
[06:19.920 --> 06:24.160]  And so if they had the opportunity to be able to grow 1,500 square feet or whatever it was
[06:24.160 --> 06:28.520]  on their properties in there, that smaller cultivation on there, this is an opportunity
[06:28.520 --> 06:34.360]  to give people a benefit for them economically, but also who knows what else it could do for
[06:34.360 --> 06:35.360]  the town itself.
[06:35.360 --> 06:36.360]  That would be awesome.
[06:36.360 --> 06:41.240]  For me, that is the spirit of what I had hoped Prop 64 would be up and down the coast.
[06:41.240 --> 06:45.440]  So Topanga could be like, fuck the Budweiser.
[06:45.440 --> 06:47.800]  We don't have a McDonald's in Topanga.
[06:47.800 --> 06:50.560]  We don't have a Budweiser store.
[06:50.560 --> 06:52.360]  It's all about craft and art.
[06:52.360 --> 06:57.240]  Topanga is craft and artisanal everything.
[06:57.240 --> 07:05.200]  For this awesome vision to happen, people in Topanga need to start getting in the ears
[07:05.200 --> 07:11.640]  of the town council to be like, this is how we want Canada to play out in Topanga.
[07:11.640 --> 07:12.640]  Absolutely.
[07:12.640 --> 07:21.520]  And you need to help us get that because statewide, from a state policy level, it's totally realistic.
[07:21.520 --> 07:23.080]  We're not dreaming here.
[07:23.080 --> 07:26.600]  The state says we could create a Topanga utopia.
[07:26.600 --> 07:27.600]  Well said.
[07:27.600 --> 07:28.600]  Absolutely.
[07:28.600 --> 07:29.600]  Absolutely.
[07:29.600 --> 07:35.560]  On that note, there is so much opportunity for Topanga and other communities, let's say
[07:35.560 --> 07:40.240]  Topanga Canyon itself, for Topanga Canyon to essentially make a market that could be
[07:40.240 --> 07:44.280]  anything that they want it to be, but it's only going to get there if they come out to
[07:44.280 --> 07:46.500]  voice their opinion.
[07:46.500 --> 07:50.840]  You have a few people that have had the supervisor's ears and the supervisor feels that that represents
[07:50.840 --> 07:52.600]  that community out there.
[07:52.600 --> 07:56.760]  And historically, I think we've seen that us in general, the cannabis community has
[07:56.760 --> 07:57.760]  just stayed in the shadows.
[07:57.760 --> 08:00.960]  And sometimes we have not come in there and yet we've had state regulations that just
[08:00.960 --> 08:06.520]  pass and given us this incredible opportunity to create the future that we want to see happening
[08:06.520 --> 08:07.520]  in there.
[08:07.520 --> 08:10.240]  For Topanga Canyon, this can still happen.
[08:10.240 --> 08:13.320]  There is time still left to make this happen.
[08:13.320 --> 08:16.400]  Nothing is at the end yet, but we are coming up close to that.
[08:16.400 --> 08:18.880]  For that to happen, they need to voice it at our town council.
[08:18.880 --> 08:22.240]  And if not just the town council, they need to voice their opinion directly to the board
[08:22.240 --> 08:25.920]  of supervisors, their supervisor, Sheila Kewel, if nothing else.
[08:25.920 --> 08:26.920]  She needs to hear this stuff.
[08:27.080 --> 08:29.000]  She needs to hear that this is what our community wants.
[08:29.000 --> 08:32.760]  If the community does not come out to say that, whatever comes in the end is going to
[08:32.760 --> 08:33.760]  be that.
[08:33.760 --> 08:35.920]  And that's not something that we want going forward.
[08:35.920 --> 08:39.760]  I don't think anyone here has wanted or thought that Prop 64 would pass and ultimately that
[08:39.760 --> 08:41.760]  just means a complete ban in your community.
[08:41.760 --> 08:43.920]  That was not what the intention was for that.
[08:43.920 --> 08:46.760]  And if we don't change these regulations, if we don't voice for what we want in our
[08:46.760 --> 08:50.960]  communities, nothing will change and that ban will still be in effect.
[08:50.960 --> 08:58.400]  Topanga could be 30 plus craft cultivators, all the same people who are, you all know
[08:58.400 --> 09:02.000]  they're your fucking neighbors, they're all growing amazing weed that you smoke right
[09:02.000 --> 09:03.000]  now.
[09:03.000 --> 09:06.520]  They could be bringing it to the monthly farmer's market.
[09:06.520 --> 09:12.180]  They could be bringing it to Holden's consumption lounge and they could be bringing it to so
[09:12.180 --> 09:18.280]  and so's retail, you know, like liquor store versus bar, right?
[09:18.280 --> 09:24.280]  So in Topanga, you know, there's this thought that runs, I think in many people's minds,
[09:24.280 --> 09:25.920]  what it could be.
[09:25.920 --> 09:30.240]  You could be driving up that beautiful canyon to begin with and you're seeing everyone out
[09:30.240 --> 09:34.200]  there and you have your neighbors, all of you who know you're growing on that in there.
[09:34.200 --> 09:36.160]  And you could be growing legally.
[09:36.160 --> 09:41.200]  You could be making this amazing product, this craft product that is specific to Topanga
[09:41.200 --> 09:44.820]  Canyon itself, something to be very proud of.
[09:44.820 --> 09:49.100]  And you can bring this out into a legal market such as a farmer's market where you can give
[09:49.100 --> 09:50.440]  to everyone else on there.
[09:50.440 --> 09:54.180]  You can see this to where it goes into a onsite consumption like a lounge where you could
[09:54.180 --> 09:56.780]  actually go and consume with your friends and your neighbors on that.
[09:56.780 --> 09:58.020]  Right next to Mimosa.
[09:58.020 --> 10:00.000]  Exactly, right next to Mimosa.
[10:00.000 --> 10:05.420]  And it could also be, it could be also that you have a infused dinner experience up there
[10:05.420 --> 10:06.420]  as well too.
[10:06.420 --> 10:11.140]  There's so many opportunities that can come from this down here that would just stimulate
[10:11.140 --> 10:13.100]  just the lifestyle in general that comes in there.
[10:13.100 --> 10:16.860]  People like to see this stuff and it's something to be even more proud of for that market,
[10:16.860 --> 10:19.820]  that niche market that's kind of in there that kind of is like, this only happens at
[10:19.820 --> 10:20.820]  Topanga Canyon.
[10:20.820 --> 10:25.140]  And the laws are there to support it if we want them to be.
[10:25.140 --> 10:28.380]  And if they are coming into effect, if the residents are asking for that stuff, if they
[10:28.380 --> 10:32.460]  are pushing their town council, if the supervisors are hearing that stuff, we can create these
[10:32.460 --> 10:33.460]  laws.
[10:33.460 --> 10:34.460]  We have this opportunity.
[10:34.460 --> 10:36.140]  We've got the voice of the supervisors' ears.
[10:36.140 --> 10:38.860]  They need to know more specifics behind what's being done.
[10:38.860 --> 10:41.460]  These are currently recommendations only that are out there.
[10:41.460 --> 10:45.220]  But if we aren't coming out there and saying, hey, this is what I want in my community,
[10:45.220 --> 10:46.220]  it won't happen.
[10:46.220 --> 10:49.500]  And Topanga has an incredible opportunity for that stuff in there.
[10:49.500 --> 10:51.300]  And if they can make that, that's the way it should go.
