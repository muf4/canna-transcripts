I mean as a hash maker I wouldn't trade this place for anywhere else in the world ever.
I mean I would go back to India for a spell but...
I would definitely go back to India because in India they view the plants as hash.
In California it's flour because everyone smokes flour.
But if you go to producing countries they don't see the plants as something to dry.
Everyone's talking about hash. Hash is in the culture.
You have kids from the age of three or four helping and robbing and carrying plants
or at least going up to the bagichos to their oldest grandmother.
And it's like they're all working and they all know it's a really beautiful time.
I mean the harvest in the mountains of the Himalaya is not quite the same
than the stress of the harvest here in the mountains.
Here it's like fuck it's so fucking unhealthy that sometimes you don't really want to be in the middle of your harvest
when it should be the most amazing time of the year.
In producing countries actually it's because of the people coming to rip you off.
The police, there is a lot of stress and people are super on edge because you have to make it happen.
Then on top of it if you have bad weather and you don't want to be around it's stressful.
There is no joy into it.
It's not until the Emerald Cup that people start to relax and think okay it's done.
Because it has to be done there is so much handicap.
