So why don't you, because you've spoken at a few cannabis conferences, can you just give a quick intro of
of who is this guy Raymond Cloyd and
where is he? Well, yeah, my name is Raymond Cloyd. I'm a professor
an extension specialist in horticultural entomology at Kansas State University, which is in Manhattan, Kansas.
I have a plethora of responsibilities which include greenhouse, nursery, landscape, turf grass,
interior scape conservatories, fruits and vegetables,
pollinators, Christmas trees, grapes,
hemp and cannabis. So yeah, I have a very full plate. I've been at Kansas State University for almost 20 years.
I was at the University of Illinois
Champaign-Urbana
approximately six years before I came here and my
appointment is basically
70 extension 30 research. So we do a wide
diversity of
programming and for both extension and research programs.
Got it. And
so you added hemp and cannabis in what year, like to the research
plate?
The cannabis and hemp component, Peter, probably came about three years ago when
you know, people don't, people, growers don't have a lot of information about the the pest complex that attacks cannabis and also hemp.
So there was a need for extension education, which included written information,
workshops, conferences that I attended to spoke at to give
growers or producers an idea of the multiple pest complexes they would be dealing with when they're growing cannabis
indoor and also hemp outdoor.
Now we can
table the answer to this question if it's going to be covered in your presentation,
but just generally like as you started to research
hemp and cannabis kind of what was the most
fascinating or interesting thing as you kind of got to know those plants?
Well, really the the most interesting aspect and from a both extension research aspect is that these are
monoculture crops that don't have a lot of or hardly have any
insecticides, miticides, or regiter for use. So it's a really prime opportunity to
do biologic control, which I'll talk about in my presentation and learn a lot because it's basically a crop that I think is a
100%
biologic control, releasing predators or parasitoids and
we can utilize that as a means to better understand more about biologic control in both the cannabis or
hemp production system.
Awesome. Well, I think
let's get into it. So why don't you cue it up and then I'll put it live on the screen once
I don't how do I get up there Peter? Share? No, no, no, you've already shared it. So just
find your PowerPoint and just make it large on your computer. There it is. Yep. Perfect. Okay
So just want me to go ahead Peter? Yep, so we can see your entire presentation YouTube webinar. Wow, you even
customize it for us. Thank you. I did I go I go 120%
But I welcome everybody the title of the presentation is plant protection of cannabis crops. I've already mentioned
I'm a professor and extension specialist in horticulture entomology plant protection at
Kansas State University in the Department of Entomology.
So there I am you can't see me, but that is not a green screen
That is Venice when I visited there many years ago a wonderful place to visit and if I had a shot from the right
This is where you would see the Renault Rail to bridge
Which is very famous, but Venice is a very spectacular place to visit and I recommend it to everybody
So what you can expect during my presentation this morning or mid morning is I'll give you all a brief introduction
We'll talk about the insect and mite pests of cannabis and then we'll focus in on what I call the plant protection strategies that include scouting
sanitation mass trapping and as I mentioned in my introduction
Biological control and then if you have any questions or discussions
Write them down and we will address them at the very end of the presentation
So first of all, what is plant protection
It used to be called IPM or integrated pest management
But because of the confusion of the overuse of it
I've started using plant protection and that means protecting your indoor and outdoor grown crops
Horticultural crops from harmful organisms and this is not restricted to just insects and mites which is going to be my emphasis because I'm an
entomologist but also be for diseases
bacteria fungi viruses and also unwanted plants such as weeds
So here's an example of an indoor production of cannabis and
They are using we call biological control and the reason I'll focus on biological control is because you have a monoculture crop and
There are hardly any
insecticides and miticides
registered for the crop because of its potential for
Consumability whether it be for the CBD oil or wherever and that restricts
the number if any use of
Insecticides and miticides consequently. It's a great opportunity for the use of biological control
so well you're growing inside a greenhouse and
What are you going to encounter?
Well pretty much most of this the typical insect and mite pests that you encounter if you're growing any horticultural crop
Including Western flower thrips broad mite and two spotted spider mite and those are just a sampling of the insect and mite pests
That we will we will be discussing
So what are the common insect and mite pests of indoor grown cannabis?
Well, we have the foliar feeding aphids we have thrips
Two spotted spider mite the infamous hemp russet mite
broad mite
Root aphids and also root mealybugs meaning these are feeding in on the roots below ground
White flies and fungus gnats now not every grower is going to get all these
But in most cases through experiences so far
These are the common insect and mite pests that one can encounter or a producer can encounter when growing
Cannabis indoors and again this would be the same listing
Other than maybe the hemp russet mite that a producer would have if they're growing any horticultural crop
So let's talk about aphids aphids are sucking insects
This is example of I believe cannabis aphid feeding on the leaf underside of
a
cannabis cannabis plant
So they are sucking insects
They do produce honeydew which is a sticky clear liquid and that allows black city mold to grow on it
They have a high reproductive capacity. We'll talk about that
So you really have to have an aggressive plant protection program when you're dealing with aphids. So what is that program?
Well, it includes diligent scouting
Sanitation removing unwanted plants in the greenhouse and then we can use biologic control agents
And this includes a series of parasitoids
Now what's really important is you have to identify the aphid to species
So that will allow you in this table one to select the appropriate parasitoid
So if you're dealing with potato aphid, then you want to purchase aphidus ervi or aphalinus abdomalis
But if you're dealing with green peach aphid or melon or cotton aphid
Then you select the parasitoids either aphidius colmanni or aphidius matricarii
So when you encounter aphids and you want to use biologic control agents in this case parasitoids
It's critical to get the aphid identified to species
So then you can select the appropriate parasitoid to purchase from the biological control distributor or suppliers
And here's an example on the left is a phytis ervi
The female laying her eggs inside of an aphid and on the right is a phytis colmanni
Those aphid the eggs will then the larva will emerge from the eggs
they will feed on the internal contents of the aphid and then cause it to be
mummified or bloated and from there the larva will pupate
become an adult parasitoid
Chew a hole out of the base of the back of the aphid and come out as an adult and
Those adults will mate and the females then will proceed to lay eggs into the aphids that are that are present in that area
Those of you that have seen the movies alien or aliens. That's what a parasitoid is
What's really important to understand is all the biologic control agents
I'll be talking about have an optimum temperature range in relative humidity
For example a phytis ervi the life cycle takes about 14 days at 70 degrees Fahrenheit or 21 degrees Celsius and
20 days at 59 degrees Fahrenheit or 15 degrees Celsius
So the warmer the temperature the faster the development of life cycle that will occur
a phytis colmanni the optimum temperature for development and parasitism
That is the attack rate is around 86 degrees Fahrenheit or 30 degrees C
So again each of these biologic control agents I'll be mentioning as an optimal temperature range
Relative humidity and also day length for performance when you follow those when you follow those optimal temperature
Ranges you're going to enhance performance of the net these biologic control agents to regulate populations of the designated paths
So I do have an extension fact sheet out there those of you out there can download this online
Just do a Google search, and it has all the information
related to aphid management including cultural physical
insecticides and also more importantly biologic control
Okay, let's move on to the second pest Western flower throats
The adult is on the left larva on the right both of these are feed on
The nutritional content of the plant and caused and can cause plant damage
So the way we manage thrips is again intensive scouting mass trapping and I'll talk about that
That's putting this yellow sticky tape out and just capturing the adults on on this this yellow tape
It's very effective in reducing populations
But also you can use a series of biologic control agents primarily predators these include some predatory mites
The insidious flower bug and also the roe beetle the loci coriaro
So these are some examples of the biologic control agents of Western flower thrips on the bottom left is or is
insidious notice the insidious flower bug
Both the adults and the nymphs feed on the larvae and adult stages of Western flower thrips on the bottom
Right is neoselos cucumbers, and it primarily only feeds in the first instar larvae of Western flower thrips
The loci coriaro
Which is known as a roe beetle is in the soil or growing medium and it feeds on the pupil stages of the Western flower
Thrips this is an adult, but also the larval stages will feed on Western flower tips pupa
So what's important to understand is what are the life stages these biological control agents prey upon well
The meat be predatory mite neoselos cucumbers for its aunt feeds in the first instar right there
Ambulance is swirsky I feeds on both the first and second instar stages of the Western flower thrips now. These are all above ground
The insidious flower bug feeds on the first second and start and the adult stages again
These are all feeding on the above ground life stages of the Western flower thrips now
Stradulated simitis formerly known as hypo asses miles is in the soil or growing medium feeding on the pupil stage and
Then Delosha formerly called a theta coriara the roe beetle is also feeding on the pupil stages
So the first three
Biologic control agents are feeding on the above ground stages
larva and adults and
The mite and the Delosha feeding on the pupil stages which are located in the growing medium or soil
so this is one of our studies we've shown that the
The roe beetle is a very efficient predator of Western flower tips
And what we have found is that three roe beetle adults per six inch pot is
Enough to provide regulation or suppression of Western flower tips
So I thought I'd provide some research science in there to substantiate
our recommendations
So the next best is to spotted spider mites and to spotted spider mites like all insects in this case is a mite
Feeds on the leaf underside. This is a close-up and the reason it's called two spotted spider
Mite is because it has these distinct dark areas which are where the digestion the food source takes place
These are the eggs laid in the leaf underside. You'll typically see webbing especially if infestations are severe and
Here's the male and female
two spotted spider mite two spotted spider mites
Are removing the chlorophyll content of the plant and the damage we see from them is often of two is speckling
That because the plant looks like each individual cell has had the chlorophyll content or the green pigment removed from it
So, how do we deal with two spotted spider mite again scouting and we'll talk more about that as we proceed through the presentation
But there are a lot of predatory mites out there
Commercially available from biological control distributors and suppliers
So what we have here the workhorse the one that's typically used in production system is phytosceles persimilis
now this only feeds on the two spotted spider mite but it has an optimum temperature range of about 68 to 80 and
a optimum relative relative humidity about 50 to 60 to 70 percent
So when you get above 80
Or the relative humidity is lower
The predatory mite does not function properly and does not regulate two spotted spider mite populations
however, there are predatory mites such as neosceles californicus and
Neosceles fallacious that will tolerate either higher temperatures
Lower relative humidity or will feed an alternate food sources other than the two spotted spider mite
Okay, the next one is
Probably the most destructive
And difficult pest to deal with and that is the hemp russet mite
The hemp russet mite is what we call an aeryophyte mite
Aeryophyte mites are cigar-shaped looking. They only have four legs
And the head is in one region. They're not the same as two spotted spider mite. That would be a different family
These are what we call aeryophyte mites
They're cigar-shaped looking and they only have four legs where your two spotted spider mite has like mice mites has about as eight legs
So, how do we deal with hemp russet mite? You want to start with non-infested plants?
You want again scout now there are some biologic control agents. However, let me say
Emphatically that you have to release these early on proactively before the plants exhibit symptoms
Once you have hemp russet mite biologic control agents are not an option
So if you want to read more I wrote an article in the July
2020 issue of cannabis business times called win the fight against suppressant mites and if you want more information
Regarding hemp russet mite you can download that article
Okay, another mite out there. So we have the two spotted spider mite
We have the hemp russet mite and now we have the broad mite and it's a very different mite
It's a tarsa neem and and the eggs of the broad might have bumps or protrusions on them
And that is what we use for a diagnostic characteristic and then over here is the the adult stage
Okay, we typically have your larvae nymphs and adults
But the way we identify the problem is by looking at the eggs if they have bumps bumps or protrusions
We know they're the broad mite
The broad mite is also very difficult to deal with because once the symptoms are expressed in the plants
Your only option at that point is to rogue or dispose of the plants
So there's close-up of the eggs
You can see the bumps or protrusions and there is an adult broad mite broad
Mite adults have a distinct white band on on their top
So, how do you deal with broad mites?
Well very similar to hemp russet mite you start with non-infested plants
If you're taking your own cuttings check them if you're bringing them in be sure to check them as close as possible
Scouting and for biologic control there are some predatory mites
But just like hemp russet mite these have to be released early in production
You almost have to release them before you see the mites
Which is really what you have to do because once the broad mite damage is exhibited
Then it's too late to release any of these predatory mites
Now root aphids and root mealybugs, I'm just going to cover root aphids
These are feeding in the roots in the growing medium, and they're not the same as the aphids I mentioned feeding on the leaves
These are very difficult to manage
You have to use clean or sterilized growing medium do not reuse growing medium
You have to scout by looking at taking plants out of the pot and looking for the aphids or mealybugs on the outside edge
of the root system
You don't want to carry over stock plants and although there's no data to back this up
The biologic control agent predator Delosha kori aria, which is the row beetle would be an option but again
we have no data to indicate that it would be effective against the root aphid, but
It is it is a possible option to try and see what happens
There are no insecticides registered label or that will be effective against root aphid or root mealybug
feeding on the roots in the growing medium
So
White flies are out there and the nymphs are on the left. These are the nipple stages
There are about four nipple stages
The final one is also classified as a pupa and the adults both the adults and the nymphs
Feed on plant and the feeding is just like aphids. They're feeding in the floam, which is the food conducting tissues
Consequently they'll emit honeydew which is a sticky clear liquid and that serves as a growing medium or substrate for black city mole
Okay
Now again for whitefly management we talked about scouting
Sanitation mass trapping like I mentioned for Western flower thrips, but there are also some biologic control agents. We have some parasitoids
including carcifermosa
everett-mosser, ceramicus and predatory mites
Including amylocele swerskyi and amylodromalus lomonicus
Okay
So I have an extension publication and you're welcome to download it online and it talks about everything I mentioned just like aphids
biology ecology damage
management cultural physical insecticidal but more importantly biological
Okay
Okay, so now we've covered the major insect and mite pest of cannabis now
Let's talk about the last one which is again feeding in the root media and this is fungus gnats on the left
It's a larva and fungus that larva have a very distinct blackhead capsule. They are feeding on the roots
They are the damaging life stage the adults flying around are more of a nuisance
They last about 10 days and then they die out, okay, so again just like root mealybugs and root aphids
This is a insect with the damaging life stages feeding on the roots in the soil or growing media
So the way we manage fungus gnats is scouting again
Sanitation mass trapping the adults and then we have some really good biologic control agents including the mite
Straddle it straddle a scimitus
Which is the same one we talked about for Western flower thrifts and again the row beetle the row beetle to me in our research
Is a very viable good predator for fungus that larva
But also we have what we call intimal pathogenic nematodes and those are good nematodes that only attack
Insects and the common one out there is called steno NEMA failed TI
So when I look at fungus ant management
It's basically releasing biologic control agents into the growing medium where they're going to attack the larval stage of the fungus gnats
Okay
So now let's focus in on some of these plant protection strategies that I have been mentioning during the course of the presentation
discussing each individual insect or my past so scouting
Culture practices
sanitation
Mass trapping in plant spacing and then of course round up with biologic control agents the culture practices
Are I'm not going to get into it include watering fertility?
Things like that giving the plants what they need
Sanitation of course is removing plant debris growing medium debris and unwanted plants
so the first item
Associated with plant protection is to establish a reliable and coordinated scouting program that is
Getting out there
Looking at the populations determining the dynamics and then recording
Being very diligent on documentation or recording information
So here's an example of a yellow sticky card we use for capturing adult white flies
And Western flower thrips and also fungus gnats you place it out there
So scouting is important to determine the presence or absence of pests and the population dynamics of insect and mite pests throughout the growing season
It isn't static you do this throughout the growing season
So this is example of Western flower thrips
populations over two years
9495 the y-axis is the average weekly thrips captured per month on yellow sticky cards and
The x-axis is January December, and this is what we call a normal distribution
And we would expect this with insects because they're co-blooded and they respond favorably when the weather or the temperature increases
So these population trends you see in greenhouses are going to be contingent on
temperature and also the stage of crop development
So here's an example of RJ I
one of the scouting
Scouters I work with and he's looking at a yellow sticky card with a hand lens and he's identifying it
And then he's recording the information on in his in his records. What is he recording?
Well, what we have here is the week and month the date and then either thrips white fly mites
Foxglove aphids or aphids so he's counting the number of insects on those yellow sticky cards and then he'd probably replace it
So this is something he records he goes back to his computer and he enters it in a Microsoft
Excel spreadsheet and then he can graph it and determine if he's seeing any
Fluctuations any any spikes in the population which warrants some type of plant protection strategy to be implemented
Another method we can use and this is very effective for thrips and spider mites is we call the beat method take your plants
put them over a clipboard of the white sheet of paper and you just gently shake it and the spider mites and
The thrips and the larval stages and nymphal stages the non flying stages will land on there now
you're not counting you're just sort of getting a presence absence estimate of the number of insects or mites that are on that plant and
Possibly in among the entire crop
So here's an example, this is not cannabis, but it's tomato, you know, we're doing the same thing
we're aggressively scouting by placing the
Clipboard of the white piece of paper and then gently shaking the foliage and that's giving us an assessment of what is out there
It's again. It's you're not counting them. You're doing presence or absence. We call this as aggressive scouting
So
Most of the insects or mite pests are typically located on the leaf ender sides
So you have to look on the leaf ender sides for these if you're on the leaf looking on the leaf upper sides
That's really not going to tell you much. Okay. So how do you do this?
well one tool that I recommend is a
10 or 16 power hand lens
I carry one wherever I go and when you're when you're out there scouting you can look on the leaf ender sides
for the presence of eggs
Larvae nymph and adults of
Almost all the insect and my pest we talked about with the exception of root aphid mealy
root and yeah root and aphids
And fungus that larvae that are feeding in the growing medium
Okay, but this works for aphids white flies to spotted spider mite in Western flower theraps
It's a little difficult to see hemp rustle mite and broad mite with this
What you're going to need to see those are probably a
Dissecting microscope and this is what we have in our laboratory
Just there about $400. But when you see damage being exhibited you can take it back immediately
look into the microscope and see if you have compressive mite or broad mites feeding or look for the eggs with the
Bumps on them. Okay, I
would say every
grower
Cannabis grower should have one of these in their office
Okay, so what's really important to understand is in the insect and mite world
It's a numbers game many of the females of the insects and Mike we've talked about have very high reproduct capacity
For example studies have shown that one green peach aphid after five generations can produce get a load of this
13 million individuals. That's a lot of aphids. Okay spider mites also exhibit high reproductive capacity
So that's why you have to do aggressive scouting in
aggressive plant protection because you cannot use insecticides and miticides like growers out there producing
bedding plants or other crops
You just don't have those options. So you really have to be
Cognizant and develop a sound scouting program and be out there regularly to minimize outbreaks of any of these pets
This is what can happen if you don't scout this is a cannabis crop and this is a day
This is extensive damage caused by juice spotted spider mite
So if you're not scouting on a regular basis, which is at least once a week, maybe twice a week
This is what's going to happen because these insects and mites
Especially when temperatures are warm or developed very fast and
Consequently can overwhelm a plant and you'll end up with this type of situation
So what are your options here? Well
You could give it to a neighbor
But more likely you're going to dispose of it as far away from the greenhouse as possible
Also
Undesirable plants weeds will host many of the insects in my past I talked about this is a pigweed
And this is leaf miner now leaf miners not a major pest of cannabis, but it gives an example of
Insects tape will use various weed species as a host
Here are aphids on a weed host very similar looking to cannabis
So again, you do not want weeds in any part of your greenhouse because they will conserve as a host
For some of the insect and my past we've already discussed
Now what about mass trapping what mass trapping entails is getting we call this yellow sticky tape
You run it along the benches
Get it close to the camp the top of the canopy of the crop you can and it'll capture
Adult thrips whiteflies and fungus that's and you can see here all the insects that has been captured by the tape
You can leave it up for the entire growing season and then take it down and start a new
Now everything I've talked about is cannot is not used in isolation
These are all used together in a holistic plant protection program
So you use mass trapping you still need a scout you still need to remove weeds and everything else I talked about
You don't rely on this one of these strategies, but mass trapping especially early on will capture the adult and minimize
The presence of the insect or not mites obviously, but I've certain insect pests
so now let's talk about biologic control, but let me step backward why a
Cannabis crop is a monoculture and you don't really have a lot to spray and you don't want to spray because you don't want any
Residues contaminating your plant especially when it's in bud and you're gonna harvest that portion
Especially for CBD oils things like that. So cannabis provides a very good opportunity
To use biologic control to the fullest and learn so biologic control is the use of biologic control agents or BCA's
Such as parasitoids and predators that will regulate or manage insect or mite pest populations
Now it's critical to understand that biologic control agents will not eradicate a pest population because they need a certain
level of insects to maintain or sustain their populations
However, the success of a biological control program is contingent on maintaining
Insect or mite pest numbers at levels low enough to minimize plant damage. That's really what you're after
Okay, and you really want to make sure you don't have insect or mite pest populations when the crop is in bud
Because you've got trichomes that are sticky and the biologic control agents will not function under those circumstances
So biologic control is a proactive you release them early on in production and you don't wait till later on
So the key is regulation of insect or mite pest populations
There is a wide variety of biologic control agents commercially available from suppliers and distributors out there
I've worked with many of them
They have great technical support the quality of the biologic control agents is sound
And we've we know a lot about these but again, we can learn more in a cannabis crop production system
So here's one of the operations I consulted on in in Colorado and we called it aggressive
Biologic control program ABCP and this is right here is when we're gonna start releasing our BCA's
So here's an operation I consulted with in Kentucky and these are sachets that contain predatory mites
You can see they're on the drip system. Well, what are those?
Well, these are sachets that contain predatory mites whether it be
Neosuchus californicus or whatever and you place them right next to the plant. So the mites which can't fly
Will come out of the sachet get onto the plant and start looking for the particular pest
to key to key
guidelines
You want to put them close to the plant and you don't want to get them wet because they will rot and this is a great
Operation because they were using drip irrigation and that minimize these sachets from getting wet
The sachet should last about two weeks
That is that's when most of the mites will come out and last it probably up to six to eight weeks. Okay
Here's some examples of other biocontrol agents that cannabis growers I've worked with have used
This is the aphid parasitoid of Phidias erva
Which means that they had Foxglove or potato aphid
They identified two species and they knew which parasitoid to release
Here's a container of Roe beetles. Roe beetles are predators of the fungus gnat larvae in Western flowerthips pupal stage and
Then the bottom right is the beneficial nematode Stenonema feltei
This is one of the products and that is used against fungus gnat larvae in the soil of growing media
So these are example the products that cannabis producers have purchased and using in their operations
Okay. Now this is some of this is very labor-intensive
You know, for example, you know releasing a container of this this is a lot of labor
well
What we've learned and developed is a technique that's a mechanized means of releasing predatory mites and that is using blowers
So you put your container predatory mites in here and you meter it out and studies have shown we've done this
That you can distribute these over large areas of a greenhouse without harming the predatory mites
And the way we did that was and you can do this on your own is take petri dishes with water
Place them out in the greenhouse
We'll do
Distributor of predatory mites using these and the mites will land on the water and you can see if they're alive or not
We've done this here at Kansas State
Colleagues of mine have also done it and we continue to do it to evaluate the quality assessment of the natural enemies
So that saves you the labor of doing the typical salt and pepper shaker method of distributing primarily the predatory mites
So
I want to focus I want to talk about two articles
I wrote recently one is titled axe aphids with biologic controls in this article, which was appeared in the July issue
cannabis business times talks about the
parasitoids which I've already mentioned and
then
The next month August or say last month
I had an article on the predatory mites you can release in cannabis cannabis business time
Those two articles you can download and read them and obtain more information than I can present in this presentation
so key points to consider
number one
Aggressively scout your cannabis crops to detect insect and mite pest infestations early if you already have an outbreak
Forget about biocontrol. You cannot use it and then you're limited either
disposing of the plants or
Give them to your neighbor or competitor. That's another option
You want to correctly identify the insect not my pest because if you're going to use a parasitoid for aphids
You have to identify the aphid to species
Determine the extent of potential damage that is assessed of spatial or space
Distribution or the time distribution we call temporal distribution of of the problem
Assess plant growth stage whether it be earlier or later on and then you can select the appropriate plant protection strategies
Very important to keep detailed records of pest occurrence
Throughout the growing season to track population trends of the specific insect or mite pest
You can contact your state extension entomologist if you have one if need be for identification and any guidelines of
What plant protection strategies you should implement?
Okay, so these are key points to consider
So I do thank you for attention, I hope you all learn something
I really hope you learn something that you can take back to your operations and improve your improve your growing system and with that
That is the end of my presentation
I would like to thank Peter for inviting me and the bug doctor is in and I'd be more than happy to address any
questions or comments you may have
regarding this presentation
Thank you very much, so I
invited Saul on as well who's
if you minimize your
PowerPoint you'll be able to see us again
Browser do I hit escape here? Yeah hit escape and then you could even just quit or actually I wouldn't quit
I would just minimize
Good morning. Good morning
How you doing nice to meet you nice to meet you Peter morning
Good morning. So did generally everything he mentioned. I mean souls on the front lines
You're doing the research. He's out there in the trenches. So kind of
Did everything he talked about generally resonate with you and kind of what are you seeing?
And and what are the tools in your toolkit?
That was that was amazing Peter thanks for bringing on Raymond Raymond, it's great to meet you and
Geez, I I just I'm sitting here watching it and saying I this is so awesome
You know that we're able to get you know real
Biocontrol, you know people with knowledge of biocontrol on on, you know, Peter's
Podcasts in particular the what resonated the most to me is
my mantra is the the the foundation of all pest management, but
Specifically biological control is monitoring. I can't preach that enough that slide that you had which
Discussed the key points to consider that's so invaluable
I you know urge everyone to whoever watches this to go back and look at that slide. That's really critical
I
Simplify the importance of monitoring and basically what you really need to to look at when you're monitoring
I think this is my personal opinion is what's out there. Okay, what's the pest?
Where is it?
How much of it is there and what life stage it's in if you have those those four bits of information
You can make decisions that are not only going to be effective but are also going to fit within your budget and that's huge
and
You know the only way
the best way to make biological control work for you and and fit in your budget is
As Raymond was saying start early. Don't stop doesn't mean you have to
You know release high rates every week
It means that you have to keep the balance tilted towards the natural enemy, right?
because
Biocontrol really has a difficult time curing a problem
So I always look at it as okay
The most important thing is to be in a preventative stage that have you know
Biocontrol be as effective now, how do you know when you're in a preventative stage?
By monitoring there's no other way and that's why to me. It's it's the foundation
Raymond would you agree with him agreeing with you?
I mean basically we reinforce biologic control is a
Proactive it's not really preventative. It's proactive. You're out there early you're scouting
You're taking notes about like like Sal said
Numbers or just presence absence and things like that
Because once the populations are outbreak or reaching damaging levels, it's really too late
Another thing I didn't I didn't cover but I can mention is control
Another thing I didn't I didn't cover but I can mention is quality assessment when you get your biologicals
You need to make sure they're alive
I mean, we know that dead insects won't regulate live insects, but that could be another another topic
So at this point is you know, you want to establish a good relationship with the biocontrol supplier such as beneficial in sector II
You want to order early? We generally say about two weeks in advance because the fluctuations can you know many of these suppliers?
So they get it from from different sources they don't normally they don't normally rear their own they get it from various marine facilities
So it's really important to order early get him out there early
And then you know continually monitor on a regular basis. So you don't have these
Outbreaks occurring that result in the fact you can't use biologic control at that time
And I think we just he must have
Accidentally disconnected or his Wi-Fi went out but um
some of this stuff, I mean we've
talked so a
Major focus of you what you talked about in your presentation what Saul focuses on is is bringing in live
Predatory bugs to combat the bugs you don't want but what about other you know, most people it's like to have kind of
Like diatomaceous earth on hand or some sort of fungicide
Like it's a little easier for your average grower to kind of have other types of things lying around
So can you talk about other?
like
You know, for example
Spraying with like someone mentioned kind of some of the maroon products like any thoughts and regalia venerate
Grandivo but just generally, you know things you could have lying around like live bugs
that's a little more high level than most people are
Able to do or prepared to do so. Can you talk about kind of other?
things one could use
Yeah
You know again Peter it results in you. This is a crop where you know spraying
It results in you this is a crop where you know spraying
To me is really not option because of the the way it's going to be processed
Overall, but I will mention, you know, we talked about sulfur sulfur has been mentioned. It's about the fungicide and the keroside
However, it will kill all natural enemies. So you can't you can't use it a lot. You can't release predatory mites and apply sulfur
It's primarily miticide to spotted spider mite
and
Press a minor broad might are very questionable because of where they feed
other ones like
Horticultural oils like mineral based oils or petroleum based oils name based oils
Are mentioned these are suffocants and they will
Again kill natural enemies, but they could be used against aphids and spider mites and grips anything anything feeding on the foliage
insecticidal soaps potassium salt to fatty acids are
Desiccants
And they are also can be used
Many of these just don't have they don't have long residuals and that's really the benefit of them
But they they themselves will also
directly kill certain natural enemies
That that was actually what I was gonna get to because I think a lot of people ask that same question
which is you know, I heard people talk about X but will that also kill the green lacewing larva the you know, the
ladybug larva the
Yeah
Sorry, Chase is trying to get on right now chase. You got to pick a camera source and an audio source, but let me see
Can I use oh, yeah. Perfect. All right. Perfect. There we go. So chase chase is also, you know, Saul's
Working at scale and lots of greenhouses in Northern, California
Chase also has a lot of experience at scale and sees the good the bad and the ugly
Chase why don't you throw in a question or two?
or comment, yeah, so
Anyways, it's a pleasure to meet you Raymond. I actually know your OSU counterpart. Dr. Eric Reback
That's actually the thing that I do whenever I move to a state is try it is try to
Contact the local extension program and then also contact the local university to be able to help develop
integrated pest man pet or pet or
Plant man plant management like you were just
What I thought chase chase just quickly. Are you wearing Bluetooth headphones?
Yes, I need to pull that out. Yeah, can you just kill him and I think because your audio is clipping
Is that better? Yep. Yeah. Okay. Do I need to repeat what I said, or did you guys hear me? I
heard you
Okay
But anyways what I was wanting to ask just what time what time it is here it is here in the Midwest most of the
insectaries from the West on those
I've had a lot of
much benefit from do do a so I was so I was there was any there was any recommend recommend
Do you have the live
No, okay your your audio it's like you're talking and then we hear you half a second later
Let me kill everything else out
We lost him but uh, well what while we're waiting for him to come back
I mean getting back to the kind of things that are you know, it's like when you take a
Penicillin or just something that wipes out all the microbes in your gut the good and the bad
So that's kind of some of the stuff people have been talking about a couple people on the chat mentioned
Nicotine or you know, so being I
guess tobacco leaves
Actually chase was one of them. I think he was one of the people that
Soaking I
guess tobacco leaves
Actually chase was one of them tobacco is one of the best natural pest killers and here's
Chase can you hear us? Yeah, is that better?
Keep going. Can you guys hear me now?
I'm using my cell phone. So I don't know how I've never used this thing before so I don't have my
my techie wife
Okay
Anyways, I was wondering you reckon you read for insectaries in the Midwest Midwest of the most trees that I fees that I've coming
from the West Coast
Let me mute you but I think he's asking for recommendations on insectaries in the Midwest because he's currently in Oklahoma
So I guess if it regionally because there are people on the East Coast you're in the Midwest
There are people kind of in the East Coast Sewell has you're on the West Coast but go for it
Yeah, Oklahoma is my is part of my territory. I have probably a dozen
cannabis
Customers in Oklahoma. I was just there a couple weeks ago visiting them
Most everyone there was and we're indoor growers. But but yeah, um, you know, I I didn't get a chance to introduce myself
but I am I work for beneficial insectary where we're
We're based in the US Northern, California
But I cover most of the southern states and and Oklahoma, Texas and New Mexico
Sorry Raymond you were hold on you're muted go for it, you know, we don't we don't have any
Biological suppliers
companies here
We rely on what's out there and the companies are out there include bio best
and corporate
IPM labs on a New York
beneficial sector II
applied bionomics up in Vancouver, Canada
Those are the ones and then I think bio works now is getting into it
So those ones we've gotten they have they have people like route Sal tech reps that are
That handle like the Midwest or wherever they're at
But that's what we deal with. We deal a lot with those companies. We do quality assessments
Consulting and so that's who that's who we rely upon
I mean I have dealt with most of the major companies for nearly over 20 years and
Feel that they have they are very reputable. They have your interest at heart and that's why I can recommend
Let let me bring up a
kind of not something you cover in the presentation, but kind of this gets to kind of
So bricks is gonna be the topic and
It is bricks important in
Plants like should you be aspiring to get those levels up and why or why not?
like can you talk about things like aphids and kind of
How they interact with the plant and those complex and simple carbohydrates
Well, we do know that insects
Can change the composition of plants
I mean the reason why certain cultivars and plants are attractive is twofold either chemical or nutritional
And we do know that at certain densities or levels
The pest can actually change the composition
of the plant of the defensive compounds of plants produce and so
You know in it, but but there's not enough information on that
You know in it, but but there's not enough information. I don't think to say that
That the feeding by the aphids is causing a substantial decrease to CBD or THC production at this point
But it could happen, but that's it, but that's another reason Peter. I don't recommend
Spraying pesticides because we do know that certain pesticides can actually change the composition of the plant
And you obviously you don't want to go above 0.3 percent THC
And that's another reason and it isn't necessarily due the active
But the inerts and the formulation that can have some impacts on the plant so that's another
Mantra I talked about why you can if you minimize
applications of
Pesticides formulated ones then you minimize any potential
indirect or direct effects on the plant itself
But can you kind of go into
Like the aphids
It's it's body and feeding and and kind of
What goes on when it's tapping into?
You know you know the underside of a plant. Oh my gosh. There's chase on
He brought the text of Fordham
Yeah
The aphids are called flown feeding insects and the flow methods reconducting tissues and what they do is they take the proboscis
They take the proboscis insert it and they start withdrawing the plant sap the floam
It's a metabolized in their internal contents and then any excess because there's a there's a lot of there's that's
Carbohydrates and and things like that is removed as honeydew and the honeydew as I mentioned
It's a sticky liquid that allows the black city mold to grow because it's a good substrate, so they're taking the floam
They're metabolizing it into
Carbohydrate sugars for their own use and then any excess is excreted out of their anus or butt as honeydew
But is there evidence that like
different type like complex carbohydrates or are there certain types of carbohydrates that are more difficult for them to feed on
I'm not aware of that. I mean basically they will feed on sucrose to get glucose and fructose sugars
But they they feed on and they feed on a wide diversity of plants
They're very prolific. So they have the ability to probably metabolize a wide diversity of carbohydrates
Obviously
the fact that they
are excreting honeydew means they're taking in more carbs and then they need and
Really I think
You know, they're just kind of a little processing plant for for carbohydrates from the floam
You know, you'll see honeydew routinely in a large infestation
my understanding in my readings show that what
really the grower really needs to be worried about with aphids is you can
you know increase their populations or their you know, their reproductive rate by having
overnourished plants and
I think most of the studies I've read by overnourished. I mean excess nitrogen
That is correct we have done studies ourselves here with meaty bugs all insects respond favorably to
plants getting over fertilized with nitrogen-based water soluble fertilizer, especially nitrogen
and the reason is because the plant becomes a better nutritional source and
In insects and mites utilize amino acids
which is the building blocks of proteins and a plant over fertilized has a higher amount of amino acids and
Consequently the plant the insects or mites will develop faster
The females can reproduce more offspring or eggs and that's again why we say don't over fertilize plants
Just give the plants what they need
for growth and development because if you overdo it like you said Sal is
You can stimulate actually stimulate a mite or an insect outbreak
Yeah, so to your to your earlier question Peter you you talked about is bricks important
Make sense that it is because you're measuring
photosynthetes and that will translate to more, you know plant tissue and oil production, but
But as far as pest management goes
Overnourishment specifically nitrogen is what I would be more worried about
And obviously, you know, I think most people
grapple with restraining themselves from putting too much
Just wanting to put too much in there
but obviously the plant needs more nitrogen in the early stages of growth and then kind of less and less so
What what's kind of an amendment strategy for like let's say you have some raised beds
In your greenhouse and you know, you're concerned like do I not have enough nitrogen for the early stages of growth
What what would you advise someone to do kind of tactically to balance that like your plant needs it
But also it benefits the bugs that want to eat your plants
Well, what I recommend is both a plant tissue analysis and a soil analysis to determine what the soil will provide and
What the plant has and so you know knowing that then that helps you to decide
Whether using a water-soluble base fertilizer or in a slow-release fertilizer like Osmocote how much to apply
We always recommend that is what what does the soil have what you need to add to the soil that the plants whether it be
micro macro nutrients or micro nutrients that the plant will need for
Development for development in a you in a normal situation without an abundance of any of those micro macro nutrients
All right, chase. Let's see if the the technical support has
So, let me unmute you you got it she came back over
All right
You got any questions or comments things you've seen
Yeah, so
We noticed that most of the operations in Oklahoma. I think that this is pretty prevalent of most
Most rows that usually you always see fun this network. Sure. Can you guys talk a little bit more about your application times that you would recommend?
actually apply these bugs and what stage of growth and
then
obviously, I also
understand importance of being
proactive
Versus waiting till you actually notice these bugs before you start implementing
some type of beneficial, but can you talk a little bit more about the
application times and then
amount per plant or per square foot
Yeah for fungus nets as soon as you put the the plants are in their permanent containers
You can release the row beetles or the mites or the nematodes
And then you put up yellow sticky cards to monitor the adults
so we use the adult counts as sort of an indirect assessment of
what's happening in terms of larval mortality and
Like we mentioned we you know the nematodes you drench on a certain number
We have found you know three row beetle adults for six inch container was enough earth pupa probably enough for fungus net larvae, too
but yeah, we've done a lot of work with fungus net larvae and adults and
The nematodes work very well be sure you do a quality assessment, but has to be done
Right right after you put them in because the young plants are sensitive in that point
It wouldn't take many larva to damage that cutting or plant as it's starting to get established
Okay, so my comment on it. Thank you. We often we often describe the Steiner nematode for
fungus net
biological control as the gateway drug to
biocontrol and by that we mean
When you use it and you see the results you are immediately convinced that biological control can work
It is implemented in
even in conventional
Operations it for you know all number of crops mostly greenhouse crops
It's it's easy and they are very effective so that that would be the go-to
for for biocontrol early
Heavy to reduce
heavier populations, this is one of those biocontrol agents that
Actually can cure a
problem
don't recommend you try to use them that way but
There's been there are you know many examples of
growers being able to bring populations of fungus nuts down to
Almost zero let's say but you know, they'll be back
that's I kind of tend to look at the Rove beetles and
You know the straddle a lep soil mite that formerly known
As hypo asbestos is kind of more bit players. They're there
They're there they're not as let's put let's put it as
aggressive or as effective as nematodes are as quick as nematodes are but they're there and and you know, as we know with an
Integrated pest management approach you want to integrate as many tools as you have
So definitely the nematodes your Rove beetles and your your soil predatory mites. You also got to think about
BT
basilis seringensis
The
Israeli ends this strain
That's also another tool tool. So that that really is my four pronged attack on
on fungus not
nematodes lead the way
the the soil beetle and the soil mite
But you can't ignore the the soil bacteria. So that's really the four four pronged attack biological control and
Don't forget you have other options so
One thing that's ignored I think is
You know cleanliness and sanitation
fungus not will breed in in
in ma and
Algae, okay clean up your algae under your benches clean up any
Standing pools water. You're just creating a source for more fungus gnats
Repellents we got it. We need more work on repellents for for
Fungus not I am I worked in mushrooms for a year
And at the time we were looking at research on cinnamaldehyde
Which is an oil that is it's an aldehyde that's in cinnamon oil
It's supposed to be repellent to at least that
Family of flies, so that's one to consider and to think about
I've heard of
people using
ground cinnamon to to repel ants
There could be something to it. There could be something to repellency on
On other botanical oils or herbal oils like for example time oil. That's another one
So these these can be used more more as a repellent to the adults, okay
Anything that you can do the mass trapping with the yellow yellow tape that was discussed earlier
You know that that helps. I think I'm not a big proponent of mass trapping but with fungus not
That's clearly one that I think is is a good strategy because but you got to put it where those gnats are
You know obviously hanging the tape up high above the canopy
It's not gonna help you as much as it will if you're somehow able to
To apply it under the canopy where they do most of their where they're where they hang out the most, right?
So, you know, it's it's an integrated approach where your last step would be some type of a
Pesticidal drench and with all of the limitations that this crop has as far as what pesticides you can use in most of the states
Really don't have any other choice
So, you know go with what works and you know
Make make bio controls for fungus not management a huge tool in in your in your toolbox
Sure, I also have another question what would you guys recommend in the event of almost a catastrophic loss because you
you walk into a grow or an operation that has
Let the fungus gnats periphery to the point where it's almost not cost-effective to be able to use something like anemesis
Because it's so expensive and they know what what I've always recommended is to almost
To wipe out all the beneficials and then just to reintroduce
sometimes but is there anything that you would recommend as a
cheaper alternative to to doing that I
I
Wouldn't I mean you just have to start over is basically what you're talking about chase
I mean there really isn't anything and I have had the situations where the fungus hats
Adults recovering the cards and the larva damages you got throw things away and just start over
Is that an enjoyable conversation to have with someone?
Well, you have to go back and ask yourself why that happened in a lot of cases it was mentioned
The sanitation was not performed. There's an allergy and their weeds
So it really it's not you have to get a step backward and look at cake
Why did you have this problem?
It's related to either culture practices sanitation or lack of scouting
And that's why we promote this because if you're it's like going down the road with blinders on you
Don't you don't check your engine a lot often. I mean, you don't know what's going to happen
And so when we see these outbreaks occurring
It's not a failure of the bile controls your passes
It's a failure of something beforehand and it's generally related cultural sanitation or lack of scouting program
Amen again
preaching
Preaching to the choir at least in my in my case
Monitoring can't say enough of it about it
one thing I will say is
the majority of cannabis growers that I have
Met
Don't understand
The role that scouting plays in other
agricultural crops
And the resources aren't dedicated to it
I've asked I've asked growers. Do you scout?
Regularly and the answer will sometimes be oh we scout daily and say wow, that's great. How do you do that?
Oh, well when we're de-leafing we scout when I'm walking through the room
And I'll be scouting if I'm looking at my irrigation
You know my spaghettis and my steaks to make sure that nothing's plugged up. I'm scouting
So I say, you know, that's not scouting that's multitasking
Okay
you need somebody who's putting their eyes on the plants and knows what signs and symptoms to look for and is keeping
Records of what I talked about already. What's out there?
Where is it? How much of it is there and what life stage is it in and reporting that back?
You know that that's not that's not what I mean by
You know
Putting putting monitoring, you know resources like putting somebody that out there
You know multitasking you really just have to devote the time and their attention to that
it sounds like a lot to spend on labor, but
You know again, you know like Raymond said you're driving with blinders otherwise
Yeah, I try to recommend excuse me
Did you hire somebody or have somebody devoted to nothing but 100% scouting because you can't take them off the line and help pot
You say that's your job and that's all you're gonna do and and they they they go in there every day
And or whatever and scout or monitor detect record information and
That's the way it has to be done. I mean you just can't you have to have somebody 100% devoted to that and
trained and
They understand scouting because putting a yellow sticky card up and checking it after a month is not scouting and I think sure
I think people really have a problem with you. What do you mean by scouting?
Once a week
So they're still a disjoint I believe which is pretty sad because we've we've got a lot of information out there
And it's a case-by-case basis. You know, somebody doing tomato crops. They're scouting will be different somebody doing a cannabis crop
So, you know, but it goes back to the fact that if you're serious about it, you need a commitment to having one individual
Just doing that as their full-time job
Sure, so 100% agreed 100% agreed. Sorry. Sorry chase
I just got a I had to throw in here. I've I've been at this for probably eight years now
You know
organic
sustainable crop protection
But four of those users have been in cannabis. So I have helped growers put together, you know
Monitoring programs that cover every every one of the major pests
And
You know that there's there are methods to do this. I one of the things I do offer to to my customers is
you know a PowerPoint presentation that I give on how to how to
You know signs and symptoms and also how to devise a scouting
Program, there's not there not a lot of resources out there
I've looked that you actually devise a really good program
So you kind of have to rely on someone who's done it before I've done it, you know for about four years now
So I have some basic guidelines. If anyone needs help out there just reach out to me
I'm sure I'm sure Peter's gonna put my contact out there on
this podcast
So anyways the question that I wanted to ask both of you is usually by the time that
Somebody calls me and I go into an operation. It's usually
Almost at that point where they
Have you know expended all the resources and most of the time I would say hey
You just need to reset the room like Raymond was saying but you know
Sometimes that's not an option and I know that I did a presentation where I walked into a grow that was literally, you know
I I would say being super conservative two weeks, but in my opinion a week away from a catastrophic loss
and
I were able to reset the whole entire room and what we did as a cheap alternative
is because we were very limited on the resources, so we literally got a
55 gallon drum of
34% hydrine peroxide
And we diluted it down to 3% and we just wiped the whole entire soil
And at the time that was what our skill set was
Because again, there was no option they didn't want to buy
Like the mosquito dunks or spend the money on nematodes to be able to do a super big flush with that
They didn't want to transplant because the plants had been overgrown
So I mean almost every scenario that you can imagine that you wouldn't want to deal with in a commercial operation
But no sometimes that especially in a new state you see people
That because they can't enter the industry
They enter in almost blindly and they don't think about a lot of these things like integrated pest management
I tell everyone that that's the first person that you hire regardless if you're a commercial grower a
Processor or even a retail location just because you need that player at all levels
So that's extremely important that also the Scouts, you know, that's the same people that you hire just like your
Your veg team or your flower team, but at the same time, you know
Not all these infrastructures have the automation to be able to do these things
So a lot of people are like hey
I can openly or blindly scale and they do all these things and they really bite off more than they can chew
So obviously at that point it turns into how do you do this for the cheapest amount of labor the cheapest amount of product?
All in and what I like to say to them is you know, hey, you know
if you would have done it this way and this is the reason why it's important to reach out to people like
Raymond and Saul and then you know people like myself ahead of time so you can integrate all these things
But that's not the reality of it
and then, you know depending on if you are
Just in a life scenario where you plant plants outside and you check on them a couple weeks
Is stuff like hydrogen peroxide a viable solution whenever it's super cheap and then
You know, what do you recommend for people that are limited and they don't know they need something that kind of encompasses
as much as possible for the least amount of money because
Biologicals at scale if you're trying to fight something versus preventative
It's almost not cost-effective a lot of times is what most people's thought process is
It's it's definitely not cost-effective to try to use bio control to cure a problem. I'd agree with that
You have to know how to use it, right? I think there's a bit of a learning curve
To being used to using them effectively
That's what my job is basically
To speed up the learning curve for the grower
Basically my experience, you know where I have fallen flat on my face make sure that the grower can avoid that
On the question of the hydrogen peroxide that might be a state-by-state question. There are products out there that you can use
That you can drench the soil with
But typically they're very very low
Concentrations of hydrogen peroxide because of the potential for root burn, right?
So if it's not hurting the root hairs
Then what's the likelihood? It's gonna hurt a fungus gnat maggot
That's you know, that's questionable
If you're using it at rates that aren't on the label or using a product that's not pesticidal
Well, then you have another whole other issue of compliance going on
so
Yeah, I think chase that's a case-by-case basis. I'd have to look at the situation
But the hydrogen peroxide products zero tall and things like that
They're biocides to kill everything but it's really to me to be a case-by-case basis and a state-by-state basis to what they can use
But again, my question would go back is what why did it? Why did it get to that level?
How did it get to that point? What what collapsed in this production process that led to?
You know spider mites out of control whatever the things that you described I have to go back and you know play detective says
Let's go back to the problem to solve the problem. Where did it start?
One of the advantages of this crop too is it's it's fast and you do have the opportunity to reset
You're not keeping a perennial crop out there where you're keeping the pest out there, you know in the field
You know from from one cycle to the next so you do have the you know
What you do have the option to you know, what we used to call
Turnaround right after you've harvested a crop then it's about okay
Didn't do so well on pests on that one had really huge issues with fungus gnat
I'm gonna do everything possible to get this room sanitary or this greenhouse
Sanitized to the point where I'm not gonna see this again, and I have an opportunity to use
Soft approaches including, you know preventative biological control and for it to work the next round
Sure, so, you know for me this goes to an infrastructure deal as well because obviously, you know
A lot of times the cleanliness issue really goes back to fundamentals
And being able to keep your area clean
Obviously, that's the the number one thing to be able to eliminate a lot of these things and obviously by cleaning you're doing the inspecting
So that's when you were able to address these things then obviously, you know
People think that the yellow sticky cards are a way to eliminate a pest versus it just being an indicator to say
Hey, this pest is in this area
But at the same time that that's the reality of what I find
What do you think about inline?
products and then
as far as like a internal fogging machine something that like say that you had a problem where
Biologicals weren't enough and you would you know, stereotypically kill a room
When would you recommend or would you recommend to have an inline?
Fogging system built into a room just to be able to on the reset sanitize the entire room
Because if you're using a sprayer if someone's out with a wand and they're spraying a room
I think there's always going to be that human error aspect
So I think that something is always going to be missed
And that's the reason why I like the idea of a fogging technology
To be able to essentially hit every you know square inch of that your rafters above your lights the areas that a lot of people
Don't take in consideration when they're resetting the rooms that stuff like powdery mildew and bugs and stuff can harbor
Well the bottom line again is coverage
I mean if you think the fogging is going to do it and you using proper concentration material
It's gonna result in lethality. That's fine. But but if not, I really like high volume because
You have control over it. You can use a lot of solution and that's just my feedback on that chase. Yeah
Yeah, and I comment on it is I like foggers. Don't get me wrong
I like the coverage the the whole idea of getting these these tiny droplet sizes deep into the canopy and
Essentially, you know creating this miss problem with that is
well, it's not the
First of the positive I like it for sanitation using something like a hydrogen peroxide
to sanitize
You know the a room for example, it's great idea because you're gonna get that coverage but
When it comes to an insecticide most of the products that are allowed for cannabis in this country
Aren't
Aren't real pesticides there, you know sauce stuff like oils and soaps and you need very good coverage there
Especially with oils oils are intended to suffocate the insect to plug up its breathing
apparatus if you put a you know, very tiny droplet out there your chances of
you know
Suffocating an insect is gonna be you know
Very little and I think the closer they are to the fogger. Yeah, maybe you might you might suffocate them
So I'm I'm of the mind just like Raymond when you're doing
Turnaround when you're sanitizing it's about really getting everything in in
you know getting all those nooks and crannies and using materials that are going to be you know using a
Equipment that's gonna allow you to really get really good coverage and you know
Really good soaking of those maybe those those insects that may be still hanging around
Yeah, well one of the things I recommend is we've been using a lot of what we call water sensitive paper and it's a yellow paper
You put it on among your crop it turns blue and I can tell you people have their eyes have been opened widely
When they think they're getting good coverage and you put this material out there and it comes back and it's still mostly yellow
So water sensitive paper to me is sort of mandatory in our operations. Yeah when we're doing spray applications
because it really gives you a
Quantitative snapshot how well you're doing with whatever based on whether equipment and whatever volume using
Absolutely. I don't think you'll get yellow those that that yellow indicator
Paper that you're talking about to show up to indicate that it's actually been
You know that it's seen any moisture if you're using a room fogger if so
So that's that's a good way to look at it is take take the indicator paper that that Raymond's talking about and tjet
They make nozzles. They have a good one. They have a good product
Put the papers far away from the fogger and prove to yourself how very little color change has occurred
If if it hasn't changed color
Using a fogger then it's not gonna hurt an insect. All right
So yeah, those are great. The other thing that's great about those indicator papers is
You know, you never know
I mean unless you're there at you know, 4 in the morning or 7 p.m
In the evening when your sprayers are actually doing the job
How good of a job are they doing? Are they wanting are they tired that day?
Are they want to get out of there or you know?
Want to go home and then have beer or whatever
Just just the knowledge of you know that of them, you know knowing that you're putting out those papers at any time
You know that they may not know where they are
It kind of encourages them to do a good job every time you can call is come back around and say hey
I found this indicator paper. I put out there and it's completely dry
You know, we need to improve you need to improve your spray pattern your technique, you know
So good training of the sprayers good equipment giving them all the tools to succeed
But at the same time it's a good way to kind of ensure that
You know, the sprayer is gonna do a good job. So um, so I agree using those as you know, really really smart tool
Sure, you know, that's where automation, you know kind of intersects with craft
You know that once you get to a certain size
You have to do certain things or certain things start happening as a result of that and for me
that's when you start seeing the disconnect between
Production or scaled cannabis versus craft is because some of these things are missed. Would you guys?
Give us a generic maybe starter
Way to be able to use beneficials and how to be able to hit everything that would
Stereotypically be in a grow and we'll just be really vague and say that obviously we would have to address your soil borne
pathogens a
Spider mite and then say aphids and then fungus gnats will say those three things like what would you set up to be able to?
do that and
Cost is obviously another thing
So people are always going to be looking at how do you
Set that up for the you know, the least amount of money or the most effective bang for the buck
Well, first of all, I don't like to make things any more complex than they are
And if you're talking about a scenario with aphids and mites and something
You know, you really have to focus in what's the what's the major insect let's just say what's it's a phase then
I would go ahead and target those
But then you still have to deal with the mite
But then you still have to deal with the mite. So really I think chasing that I mean biologic control work
But it doesn't work in every situation. It's a case-by-case basis when you're dealing because today we are dealing with multiple test complexes
We have growers that have thrips white flies and aphids and I don't recommend
You know more than two biologic control agents because it gets too complex. You've got mutual interference. You've got integral predation coming in and
You just gonna have to have to make a choice and I don't really feel comfortable
giving a really generic example because a lot of things can happen in the implementation of so
I also have to go pretty soon, but I think
Chase it's more of a case-by-case basis talking to the grower getting some background
you know figuring out why spider mites of the problem why aphids of the problem and maybe hone in on one and
Maybe use something different not an you know, either a cultural or sanitation aspect to deal with the other one
Yeah, I am my approach is I've been working I've been working with these growers with cannabis growers here for for a bit now and
Basically when a grower asks that sort of a question is well, what do you recommend for like a comprehensive IPM program?
Then I say, okay. Well, I've got a questionnaire that I'd like you to fill out
And it'll basically give me an idea of your crop cycle
Okay, and then also I'd like to know what materials you have confidence in that you you know work with before and you you know
That way I can look through to see on your list
What is compatible with biocontrol and also?
What is less than compatible and then how you should go about making a decision on whether you use that material?
With biocontrol generally I do recommend for the major pests
In indoor and greenhouse, it's different than outdoor
But just because a lot of this is going on in greenhouse and indoor basically, I'm I'm looking out for
Primary, you know number one pest would be the spider mites because that everyone has spider mites
So there's got to be an unapproachable spider mite
Then you know with the risk of a fit. It's good to have some generalists out there to
Some generalists that will target a fits on necessarily the parasitoid wasps right away
But something that'll that can that will also feed on other things beyond just the a fit. So there's there's a there are
Biocontrol agents that you know that fall into that description
Lot of cannabis growers are concerned with fungus not there's we've already talked about strategies
Thrips is the other one
Those are primarily the ones we worry about as far as biological control goes. I
really really
Appreciate Raymond that you mentioned hemp russet mite and how you know
We just don't have the literature yet to be able to recommend any
commercially available
Predator at least not the ones that are commonly available commercially to control it. So I do not have a
hemp russet mite biocontrol recommendation
Sure, there could be strategies that involved some of the predatory mites out there
But I'm not going to sit here and recommend that you buy this expensive
Predatory mite so that for it to control your hemp russet mite outbreak
There are other strategies for that and it it's case by case
That's why working with you know, your IPM specialists, you know the growers that work closely with me
We're you know able to come up with programs that work for them and then
After a while, it's all really based on monitoring and where you want to put your resources
If you've got the thrips under control, then you know
Maybe you don't want to spend half of your budget on thrips anymore, right?
Maybe you want to you know release less frequency or with or at lower rates
That those kind of decisions, but those are all based on monitoring, right?
So yeah case by case, but again, you know, that's why people like myself are around for guidance
You know help you help you, you know design a program that works for your grow, you know your
Particular crop cycle and preferred materials
And and then you know just help guide you so that eventually you get to the point where it's like, okay
This is working and this is where you know now I can really you know
Really start moving more towards bios and farther away from sprays
Yeah, but before I go Peter I have to say that
You know Saul I agree
Compatible doesn't mean anything from a scientific standpoint
We talk about integration and we do a lot of that work
And when you when you're talking about integrating biological trolls or pesticides you get into a whole complex
We've been spending ten years on that and the thing is the materials that are registered or out there like oils and soaps and silver
They're all harmful to natural enemies directly
So it's like you can't use those with a mite or a parasite because you're gonna you're gonna disrupt your bio control program
So, you know, that's that's an issue and again, it's all says it's a case-by-case basis look and so at that
I'm just gonna kind of leave it because I'm gonna have to go it's getting close to the 90 minutes, but it has been a joy
Doing this meeting Saul and chase and if you ever have any questions or comments, well, let's uh, let's say
Let's stay in touch and we'll do the best we can to help cannabis growers to overcome some of these
In this case off the pot pest problems
Well, we appreciate it and hopefully we didn't scare you away and you'll come back again soon
I had a bunch of additional questions that there was one. I don't know if you have one minute, but
Matthew is in the audience right now wanted me to ask you about the kinky sex lives of parasitic wasps. I
Don't know if that's kinky sex life. It's basically that they come out the they mate and then the same females lay eggs
It's it's not like cockroaches or bed bugs where it's very hard in the female
But it's not really kinky sex
This is where the female may eat the male
So better be good the first time. So, I mean, I don't think it's it's very parasitoids are kind of boring for sex life
Matthew might be referring to a fit of ladies a fit of Miza. That's a key
Yeah, Kelly Vance has a really good presentation on that they basically what's kinky about them is
I guess they're kind of what like kind of like masochists
Yeah, I'm gonna have to go Peter so I can talk more about that if
We'll let Raymond go and we'll let us
Talk about bugs with the kinky a sex life
Interesting sex life. Yeah. All right. Thank you. I'm gonna meet you Raymond
Will
All right
So so let's hear it
Okay, so I have not used a fit of ladies, but you know Kelly I know Kelly well we work together
He's using
He create he his recommendation is if you're trying to establish this first of all, it's a midge
It's a little teeny tiny fly that lays its eggs in
Aphid or lays eggs and near aphid colonies and then when the larva hatches
it's a little maggot that will actually sit there and or that actually move into the colony and
Chomp away at a fits. So it's not a parasitoid. It's not putting an egg inside of the of the aphid
It's literally just eating them
alive
Anyway, they um, these little these little midges these little tiny flies
They have a habit where my understanding is the females
Or maybe it was a males will look for a spider web
And attach themselves to it and that's yeah
I think it's the females and then the males are attracted to the to to the the struggling
to the struggling female
And and so I guess what's just quickly is this the right? Yes. Yes. That's it
and and I guess what's kinky about that is um
Basically in order to mate you're putting yourself at the risk of being eaten alive by a by a spider
So that's a little bit like what that
Asphyxiation, you know fetish that's out there where you risk your life or you know sexual pleasure, I guess
That's it was so what's interesting here is that you know, that's actually a good bug to have right? Yes
Yes, it's commercially available
It works in in
all kinds of crops
Not sure about how effective it is in cannabis I tend to want to recommend some a
Parasitoid I've seen the results from using parasitoids
They're great
These are a little bit. I like to say I don't have the experience enough to say that that they'll that they'll work in cannabis
The canna be the cannabis canopy the typical canopy
I'm not sure it lends itself to the use of this biocontrol agent, but not enough growers have tried it
so, you know, I certainly I'm not gonna say it won't work, but
It works great in lots of other crops, but they have a different canopy architecture than than does cannabis
Yeah, I was trying to find a nice big picture of it but
Yeah
Yeah, yeah the the antenna have those hairs on them and they they curl back like that
They're really tiny and you know, very delicate
but
They'll they will do a number on a fits
Got it. So is there a
next super bug for cannabis that you're forecasting to be the
I mean I get to see a lot of grows in different states
Honestly right now the hop latent by right is to me the biggest concern if we ever find that it is vectored by an insect
Which I want to you know
Reiterate we don't know that yet
If it's vectored by an insect then that's gonna be a game-changer
So I'm not sure if it's gonna be a game-changer
But I'm not sure if it's gonna be a game-changer
See what I'm what I've been hearing a lot more about in fact, I'm gonna go visit a grower today who is battling leafhoppers
Leafhoppers
Can be problematic their feeding damage can be problematic in some crops the main
Issue with the leafhopper and cannabis is that we have found
There's a virus that is a virus that is a virus that is a virus that is a virus that is a virus
That certain leafhoppers can transmit it is it shows symptoms and actually can can hurt your crop
Your cannabis crop the be curly top virus, I think
Peter we talked about it and at another podcast
But that's a concern because it's a tough
insect to deal with
and
It could be a devastating virus if it you know
gets in your crop so
Yeah
as far as next super predators, there's
There are some predatory mites out there that are really interesting that we're looking at
But you know, that's about all I can say right now
Someone actually asked in the beginning of the show not leafhoppers, but treehoppers
Mm-hmm there I've I have seen treehoppers froghoppers all that that basically that
those families of insects in cannabis
the one of concern the one of most concern for me has been leafhopper because it's the only one I have experienced with
really causing problems in a number of crops add to that the possibility of vectoring this be curly top virus or
Even
There's there's a few other
There's other micro microorganisms that they can also vector meaning move from plant to plant
You know that that risk right there makes them put them on my radar
Leafhoppers and froghoppers and all the other ones that are kind of related. I'm not I'm not I'm not as concerned
All right. So we have here we have all right the treehopper on the way right the leafhopper on the way left
You can see these are all in different families, so for example the leafhopper sickidelity
But aphids are aphid deity
So they're so they're all in basically the they are all true bugs. What are you know called true bugs?
Back in the day these were called homeopterans because their wings
Didn't look different from each other
Look different from each other I guess what it was versus the the other bugs that we're used to like
like ligus bug or something like that, but
Yeah, these are all usually
You know
sap suckers with with piercing mouth parts
and
Many of them produce honeydew
So like the white fly and aphids do and
Psyllids a number of them do but they're all just kind of
Fast multiplying, you know, take over and a lot of them actually move
viruses
It's a bummer because some of I mean they're pretty cool-looking but then you're like you gotta go yeah, yeah
Yeah, I I love them. I I love arthropods of you know grew up as a kid catching everything I could but
My job now is to get rid of them, right
At least the bad ones I
Guess I have one more question. I'm gonna have to jump off of here. I actually have to go to to work but
Wanted to know about what you would recommend as far as when you're scouting
Say for example that you find a living soil type situation that someone is
Living soil type situation that someone has a bunch of ants. So obviously with ants you would look, you know for
Aphids just because of them being able to harvest that honeydew
What are some of the the things that you start looking for whenever you are?
Inspecting some of those living soil or those natural
habitats spaces for
Bugs whenever you don't have access to every single plant being able to pull, you know
Something that's really big and robust and you just can't you know, go through all those within a reasonable time frame
Yeah, as far as ants I wouldn't go the biocontrol route
There's probably no predator that that's commercially available out there
That's gonna have a an easy time with you know with the way they work, which is basically attack you as a group
And they have their their mandibles and their poisons and they don't give up
So you you kind of have to deal with ants in any other way that you possibly can talk a little bit about repellents
I've heard that cinnamon oils that they don't like cinnamon oils, you know, you you might be able to find
Some kind of a spray that you can use to repel them
They they also
You know most
most
Home, you know people in in in homes that you know have that problems. They will
They use bait bait stations bait traps, right?
So it's basically it's a little a little bait a little station inside of it
There's a sugary or attractive substance with some kind of a stomach poison
The ant you know finds the sugar takes it back to its nest and then kills the entire colony
There is an org an organic version of that. It's it's basically boric acid
And if you if you mix boric acid with a sweet solution, there's there's a product out there already
Just can't remember the name of it
If you I can get it to you later Peter
But you you know, it's mixed with boric acid mixed with a sugary substance that takes a lot of feeding
But it will kill them and it is it is not
Toxic like, you know, some other poison would be takes a little bit longer, but but they can be effective
So, you know and yeah trying to keep them out of the growl it living soils tough with that
and
Ants not only you know
encourage aphids, you know and and you know
Basically protect they protect them. So any and all of your
biocontrol
agent so lacewing larva
Aphidius wasp the the aphid elites whatever you might be using out there that the
Ant can see and attack they're gonna they're gonna protect their aphid colony because you know, there's it's essentially like their cattle
They're milking them for the honeydew, right?
So it's just like a farmer sees a wolf hanging out or a coyote hanging out near his corral
You know, he's gonna go get a shotgun
So
I just know that you know
These are some of the the problems that you see, you know in the field and they're things that you know
People want to deal with and I get asked all the time, you know
How do we make a perimeter defense that is for one cost-effective and to not going to be?
you know super destructive to like the watershed or you know, potentially the
ecosystem of the area so
You know, it's just something that I have a lot of interest in but at the same time
I know that it is a challenge for both commercial and home growers. Yeah answer answer a Bain
another one another thing I just thought about is
Some growers actually taken sticky sticky substances
You know like what's on the on the sticky traps and the yellow cards, you know
Some type of a glue and paint and painted their trunks with it
And that makes it so the ants can't have an easy way up and down
You know, their colonies are usually going to be subterranean
So down in the in the soil bed is where their colony will be. Well if they have a huge, you know
Sticky, you know
Part of the if part of the trunk is sticky they can't easily get up there, right if you have a trellis
They'll climb right up a post and up through the trellis and into the canopy
So you might have to paint, you know the post as well, but it's a good strategy because you know
You don't you're not allowing them access. Basically. It's an exclusion strategy
Right. So if you do get a FID, they have a harder time tending to them and your bio controls have the advantage
Well, why don't we end on that because I think everybody has stuff to do just quickly sell are you on I realized are you on Instagram?
Our company is beneficial insectary. I'm not I'm kind of an antisocial hermit. I like that
Yeah beneficial insectary
Give me one second and you have my email so you can go ahead and publish that
You know anyone feel free to reach out
We're here to help there's the company

So right now I'm primarily just using
My personal one, which is the chase zero for 20
All right zero for yep. There you are
Hold on and there is chase
Wait, do you have how you do it posts? Okay. Got it. Okay
Cool. All right. Well, thanks for reaching out to me. I appreciate it. I appreciate you
Cool all right. Well, thanks everyone and thanks chase and several for being sports and jumping on with zero notice
I was like Raymond Floyd speaking anyone want to jump on so
I'm usually I'm usually stationary on Fridays now nowadays
So you can you you can probably count on being able to find me at the last minute on a Friday cool
And
All right, so just quickly. Yeah Friday morning. So Saturday. I don't know if he's lurking in the chat, but we got
Chad Westport
Sunday possibly James loud and
I know
Pedro down here and so Cal is chopping this week and wanted to do a live a
live chop
of his garden
He's live bubble hash on Instagram, so hopefully we'll set that up and maybe a wash and a squish
But uh, anyway, thank you everyone
Yeah, you as well I'll be in touch all right a good one, thanks Peter
