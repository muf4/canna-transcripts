[00:21.440 --> 00:26.440]  Welcome to our pro athletes and cannabis panel.
[00:27.520 --> 00:29.500]  This is also for anybody that's an athlete,
[00:29.500 --> 00:30.680]  whether you're 80 years old
[00:30.680 --> 00:32.360]  and you go for a walk in the evening,
[00:32.360 --> 00:35.080]  like if you're a runner, you like to swim, whatever,
[00:35.080 --> 00:37.360]  anybody can use cannabis within athletics.
[00:37.360 --> 00:39.480]  So we're quite lucky to have these
[00:39.480 --> 00:42.140]  high-end professional athletes up here with us.
[00:42.140 --> 00:43.640]  But at the end of the day,
[00:43.640 --> 00:46.280]  this information translates to everybody in the room.
[00:46.280 --> 00:49.880]  So I always like to analogize that we've got these top pros,
[00:49.920 --> 00:51.680]  but I'll be the average Joe up here
[00:51.680 --> 00:54.440]  and all of you can listen from my perspective as well.
[00:55.480 --> 00:58.920]  And I also really call this panel Marijuana Rebranded.
[00:59.840 --> 01:02.120]  It's really, I think, since the year 2000
[01:02.120 --> 01:05.180]  when Y2K, the world didn't end,
[01:05.180 --> 01:07.640]  everybody kind of started to doubt certain things
[01:07.640 --> 01:09.160]  and people collectively, I think,
[01:09.160 --> 01:11.760]  woke up conscious-wise in America
[01:11.760 --> 01:14.520]  to the fact we were being lied to about cannabis.
[01:14.520 --> 01:18.000]  That's when the culture shift really, to me, 2000 happened.
[01:18.000 --> 01:19.840]  And now, 18 years later,
[01:19.840 --> 01:22.300]  it's a beautiful place to see where we are today.
[01:23.200 --> 01:26.820]  The true rebrand, really, marijuana was a drug.
[01:26.820 --> 01:28.840]  It was bad for you.
[01:28.840 --> 01:30.240]  Bad people used it.
[01:30.240 --> 01:32.420]  It made you lazy, made you stupid.
[01:33.560 --> 01:35.240]  And even the word itself, marijuana,
[01:35.240 --> 01:37.440]  just I'm sure most of us know the connotations
[01:37.440 --> 01:38.880]  behind the word, we're not positive.
[01:38.880 --> 01:41.320]  So now cannabis is a medicine
[01:41.320 --> 01:44.220]  and cannabis is used for wellness and to help people
[01:44.340 --> 01:48.060]  to fix seizures and enlightened people use cannabis.
[01:48.060 --> 01:51.940]  So on that note, on the light of enlightenment,
[01:51.940 --> 01:53.620]  I'm gonna start off by letting our panelists,
[01:53.620 --> 01:55.820]  starting with Al here, introduce themselves
[01:55.820 --> 01:56.940]  instead of me doing that.
[01:56.940 --> 01:58.900]  And just, I guess the way I'd love for you
[01:58.900 --> 02:01.220]  to introduce yourself is tell us who you are
[02:01.220 --> 02:02.940]  and then tell us really, ultimately,
[02:02.940 --> 02:05.460]  the most important part, why you're here today.
[02:05.460 --> 02:06.300]  Well, how you doing?
[02:06.300 --> 02:08.580]  My name is Al Harrington, former NBA player.
[02:08.580 --> 02:11.900]  I played 17 years professional basketball
[02:11.900 --> 02:13.700]  from Orange, New Jersey.
[02:13.700 --> 02:15.720]  Now reside here in Los Angeles.
[02:16.660 --> 02:18.400]  I live on vacation, I love it here.
[02:19.500 --> 02:21.180]  But what I'm doing here today,
[02:21.180 --> 02:23.140]  obviously, is just to continue to raise awareness
[02:23.140 --> 02:26.540]  about the unbelievable benefits of cannabis.
[02:26.540 --> 02:30.140]  And quick on my story, I told you I grew up in Jersey,
[02:30.140 --> 02:34.900]  so the war on drugs was really real when I grew up.
[02:34.900 --> 02:36.820]  I either seen people getting locked up
[02:36.820 --> 02:38.180]  or I was always taught to believe
[02:38.180 --> 02:40.660]  that cannabis or marijuana at the time,
[02:40.660 --> 02:44.900]  or Rifa, how people used to talk about it,
[02:44.900 --> 02:47.620]  where I'm from, was a gateway drug.
[02:47.620 --> 02:50.100]  So throughout my whole life,
[02:50.100 --> 02:53.700]  especially me going to the NBA out of high school,
[02:53.700 --> 02:55.700]  I was always afraid of cannabis.
[02:55.700 --> 02:57.540]  And when I got in the NBA, that was the first time
[02:57.540 --> 03:00.000]  that I saw actually top-notch players
[03:00.000 --> 03:01.820]  actually using cannabis, but at the time,
[03:01.820 --> 03:02.860]  I still didn't understand it.
[03:02.860 --> 03:04.480]  It still didn't make sense to me.
[03:04.480 --> 03:07.300]  And I looked down on my teammates that used cannabis.
[03:07.300 --> 03:10.820]  But in 2011, my grandmother had come to see me play
[03:10.820 --> 03:12.440]  when I was playing for the Denver Nuggets.
[03:12.440 --> 03:14.840]  And Denver's obviously one of the first markets
[03:14.840 --> 03:19.240]  to have a medical program, and she suffered from glaucoma.
[03:19.240 --> 03:21.700]  And glaucoma was always the first thing
[03:21.700 --> 03:24.560]  that cannabis was, that actually healed,
[03:24.560 --> 03:26.980]  was something that it considered to heal.
[03:26.980 --> 03:29.900]  So I was able to convince her to try cannabis,
[03:29.900 --> 03:32.640]  and it was hard because she was the main person
[03:32.640 --> 03:37.320]  growing up telling us that weed was a gateway drug.
[03:37.320 --> 03:40.000]  And when I was able to get her to try it,
[03:40.000 --> 03:41.920]  I checked on her an hour and a half later,
[03:41.920 --> 03:43.300]  and when I went downstairs,
[03:43.300 --> 03:46.280]  she was downstairs reading her Bible.
[03:46.280 --> 03:48.120]  And when I asked her how she was doing,
[03:48.120 --> 03:49.920]  she said, I'm healed.
[03:49.920 --> 03:51.200]  She said, it's the first time I've been able
[03:51.200 --> 03:53.740]  to read my Bible in over three and a half years.
[03:53.740 --> 03:55.560]  And for me, that correlation was just crazy
[03:55.560 --> 03:58.560]  that from someone like her, and I always say,
[03:58.560 --> 03:59.960]  if my grandmother's not going to heaven,
[03:59.960 --> 04:01.640]  we're all going to hell.
[04:01.640 --> 04:04.360]  And for the first thing that she would do
[04:04.360 --> 04:06.640]  was actually go down and read her Bible,
[04:06.640 --> 04:08.400]  to spokes volumes to me.
[04:08.400 --> 04:11.200]  And at that point, I started to educate myself.
[04:11.200 --> 04:13.640]  The end of that season, I actually had a knee surgery
[04:13.640 --> 04:15.340]  and got a staph infection.
[04:15.340 --> 04:18.120]  And I was in the hospital for 10 days.
[04:18.120 --> 04:20.560]  I had four surgeries in a week.
[04:20.560 --> 04:23.240]  And at some point, I thought I was going to die.
[04:23.240 --> 04:25.160]  But when I was sitting in there,
[04:26.160 --> 04:28.360]  obviously I'm taking all this pain medication,
[04:28.360 --> 04:31.600]  and this lady that I had knew in Colorado came to see me,
[04:32.440 --> 04:34.120]  and she introduced me to CBD.
[04:34.120 --> 04:35.720]  And she gave me all these topicals,
[04:35.720 --> 04:37.840]  she gave me tinctures, capsules.
[04:37.840 --> 04:41.280]  And ever since that day, I haven't taken an aspirin,
[04:41.280 --> 04:42.760]  I haven't taken an Advil,
[04:42.760 --> 04:45.040]  I haven't taken any pharmaceutical drugs
[04:45.040 --> 04:48.040]  to manage my pain away from the game.
[04:48.040 --> 04:50.940]  And pretty much that's my story, and that's why I'm here.
[04:52.080 --> 04:52.920]  Hi.
[04:52.920 --> 04:53.760]  Hello.
[04:58.080 --> 04:59.920]  Al's story is great.
[04:59.920 --> 05:02.520]  And Jim's and everybody's up here.
[05:02.520 --> 05:05.360]  And I think the reason I'm in cannabis
[05:05.360 --> 05:07.420]  is because I ask a lot of questions
[05:07.420 --> 05:08.480]  and do a lot of listening.
[05:08.480 --> 05:11.960]  And if you do that, you can hear countless stories
[05:11.960 --> 05:14.020]  of lives this changes.
[05:15.240 --> 05:16.440]  My name's Matt Nordgren.
[05:16.440 --> 05:19.080]  I run a fund called Arcadian.
[05:19.080 --> 05:21.080]  We do a lot of investing in the industry.
[05:21.080 --> 05:23.000]  I've been doing that for years.
[05:23.000 --> 05:24.920]  I've been very successful at it.
[05:24.920 --> 05:26.540]  Also was a former athlete.
[05:27.540 --> 05:31.620]  Somewhere probably in between Joe and Al, Jim and Al.
[05:31.620 --> 05:34.220]  I was a backup quarterback my whole career.
[05:35.020 --> 05:37.320]  So a little bit of an average Joe
[05:37.320 --> 05:39.740]  that was around a lot of high-level athletes.
[05:39.740 --> 05:43.900]  And so, didn't have to use a lot of it for pain,
[05:43.900 --> 05:47.780]  but was around a lot of guys that did for a long time
[05:47.780 --> 05:49.700]  and really saw a lot of benefit
[05:49.700 --> 05:52.340]  that it did give a lot of athletes.
[05:52.340 --> 05:55.940]  I used it as well in my own personal story.
[05:56.020 --> 05:58.020]  My grandmother had Alzheimer's,
[05:58.020 --> 06:00.980]  were able to help her quality of life
[06:00.980 --> 06:02.840]  at the end of her life.
[06:02.840 --> 06:04.820]  Had a couple of cousins with cancer,
[06:04.820 --> 06:07.020]  was able to increase their life,
[06:07.940 --> 06:10.340]  have quality of their life at the end of their life.
[06:10.340 --> 06:11.620]  All three have passed.
[06:11.620 --> 06:14.860]  And so, not just hearing other people's stories,
[06:14.860 --> 06:17.980]  but you end up experiencing some of your own.
[06:17.980 --> 06:19.940]  And I think these are the types of things
[06:19.940 --> 06:21.460]  that make this industry work.
[06:21.460 --> 06:23.820]  So we got into it.
[06:24.780 --> 06:27.180]  It has been one heck of an economic benefit,
[06:27.180 --> 06:29.020]  that's for sure.
[06:29.020 --> 06:32.020]  But it feels really good to be in an industry
[06:32.020 --> 06:34.500]  that you can do good business
[06:34.500 --> 06:36.020]  and feel good about the business
[06:36.020 --> 06:37.420]  that you're doing every day.
[06:45.520 --> 06:47.040]  Hello, oh, there we go, hi.
[06:48.160 --> 06:51.280]  Hi, everyone, my name is Eliza Maroney.
[06:51.280 --> 06:54.180]  I am the co-founder of Lucky Box Club,
[06:54.180 --> 06:57.800]  a cannabis subscription service here in California.
[06:57.800 --> 07:00.560]  Yes, we actually do deliver actual products
[07:00.560 --> 07:02.360]  to your doorstep.
[07:02.360 --> 07:04.840]  And I'm also known as the Cannabis Yogi.
[07:04.840 --> 07:08.440]  So I've launched a brand that infuses yoga classes
[07:08.440 --> 07:10.640]  with cannabis in various different ways.
[07:10.640 --> 07:13.740]  Every attendee receives a Lucky Box, one of our boxes,
[07:13.740 --> 07:16.040]  and they get to learn about new brands and products
[07:16.040 --> 07:19.160]  in the process before, during, and after their classes.
[07:19.160 --> 07:23.280]  It gives people a really warm, intimate space
[07:23.280 --> 07:25.680]  to experiment with new products
[07:25.680 --> 07:28.720]  and to learn about the different ways of using cannabis
[07:28.720 --> 07:30.880]  and CBD as well.
[07:30.880 --> 07:32.800]  We have CBD-only boxes.
[07:32.800 --> 07:37.000]  And I am in this because I, just like everyone else,
[07:37.000 --> 07:39.440]  I think, in this room have been profoundly moved
[07:39.440 --> 07:43.800]  by this amazing, incredible plant in many different ways.
[07:43.800 --> 07:48.200]  So my history does stem back to being a cultivator
[07:48.200 --> 07:50.380]  and going from cultivation into retail
[07:50.380 --> 07:52.960]  and really understanding the entire plant process,
[07:52.960 --> 07:54.480]  and I'm really proud of that.
[07:54.480 --> 07:57.080]  I am not a professional athlete.
[07:57.080 --> 07:59.680]  I'm the only one on this stage right now.
[07:59.680 --> 08:01.340]  But I do have a lot of insight
[08:01.340 --> 08:03.640]  in how cannabis can enhance performance
[08:03.640 --> 08:06.000]  and it can also help people to heal
[08:06.000 --> 08:09.400]  after post-workout and games, I would imagine.
[08:09.400 --> 08:10.620]  So, thank you.
[08:16.760 --> 08:18.200]  Hi, I'm Nick Moody.
[08:18.200 --> 08:20.480]  I actually recently just retired from the NFL,
[08:20.480 --> 08:23.400]  primarily that's why I'm here, to focus on this industry.
[08:24.480 --> 08:26.600]  I played for the 49ers, that's who drafted me,
[08:26.600 --> 08:29.360]  kind of my introduction to the industry firsthand.
[08:30.200 --> 08:33.360]  And then the Seahawks and the Redskins.
[08:33.360 --> 08:36.080]  So we got a company started a couple years ago,
[08:36.080 --> 08:38.480]  initially, my dad and a couple partners.
[08:38.480 --> 08:41.360]  So now we're transferring, we're translating,
[08:41.360 --> 08:43.520]  ah, I'm tripping right now, sorry.
[08:44.660 --> 08:46.200]  No, we're switching over from a grow
[08:46.200 --> 08:47.840]  to a manufacturing facility.
[08:47.840 --> 08:49.880]  So that's what our primary focus is right now.
[08:49.880 --> 08:52.400]  And the reason I'm really big on marijuana
[08:52.400 --> 08:54.200]  is it's not just me, it's my family.
[08:54.200 --> 08:56.080]  As a whole, we believe in the benefits of it,
[08:56.080 --> 08:58.600]  not just physically, but for your mental well-being
[08:59.320 --> 09:00.440]  with my history in football,
[09:00.440 --> 09:02.320]  I mean, I played linebacker in free safety
[09:02.320 --> 09:03.800]  at Florida State and then in the league.
[09:03.800 --> 09:05.880]  So I've had plenty of injuries, dislocated shoulders,
[09:05.880 --> 09:10.880]  broken bones, concussions, disc issues, arthritis.
[09:11.160 --> 09:13.280]  So I've had pretty much just about anything you can imagine.
[09:13.280 --> 09:18.280]  So my thing is like the benefits of just the plant itself,
[09:18.440 --> 09:20.920]  them wanting to restrict us from being able to use it
[09:20.920 --> 09:22.700]  and prescribe us opiates,
[09:22.700 --> 09:24.880]  that's a big contradiction in my opinion.
[09:24.880 --> 09:26.520]  And that's what I'm kind of getting into more.
[09:26.520 --> 09:28.480]  So now is the advocacy for that.
[09:29.360 --> 09:31.680]  And the wellness and the THC and the CBD as well.
[09:31.680 --> 09:32.880]  So that's why I'm here.
[09:33.960 --> 09:38.680]  I'm no Gary V, but I occasionally swear just a warning.
[09:38.680 --> 09:41.200]  And I wanted to say it must feel fucking good
[09:41.200 --> 09:43.680]  to be able to come out of the closet of cannabis
[09:43.680 --> 09:46.000]  and not have the NFL breathing down your neck.
[09:47.440 --> 09:50.440]  That was huge because personally, from my experience,
[09:50.440 --> 09:52.320]  I was a guy that was actually in the drug program.
[09:52.320 --> 09:55.200]  So I got put in there for two years and I put in there,
[09:55.200 --> 09:57.480]  well, I failed the test and then I was placed in there.
[09:57.520 --> 09:58.640]  So that comes along with,
[09:58.640 --> 10:00.480]  I was tested twice a week, every week.
[10:00.480 --> 10:01.680]  So up to eight times a month,
[10:01.680 --> 10:04.020]  they would come six in the morning, three in the afternoon,
[10:04.020 --> 10:06.760]  Saturday mornings, ask you where you are,
[10:06.760 --> 10:09.240]  you got to give them a log of your travel.
[10:09.240 --> 10:11.400]  So I actually had family members and friends
[10:11.400 --> 10:12.600]  that have actually been on probation.
[10:12.600 --> 10:15.620]  They had less restrictions than I did.
[10:15.620 --> 10:17.080]  But just being in that process
[10:17.080 --> 10:18.760]  and seeing other guys go through that process
[10:18.760 --> 10:22.040]  and then just that you actually kind of really realize
[10:22.040 --> 10:24.680]  how much cannabis does help you in terms of your injury
[10:24.680 --> 10:26.400]  and then the stress and like dealing with the stress
[10:26.400 --> 10:28.560]  of being a pro athlete, the family demands
[10:28.560 --> 10:29.520]  and all that stuff.
[10:29.520 --> 10:31.720]  And then when you have that taken from you,
[10:31.720 --> 10:33.880]  when you're somebody that actually relies on that,
[10:33.880 --> 10:35.240]  or you don't even realize you rely on it,
[10:35.240 --> 10:37.000]  but it does really help you,
[10:37.000 --> 10:39.120]  then you kind of see like the negative outcome of that.
[10:39.120 --> 10:40.920]  Sometimes you'll be in certain situations
[10:40.920 --> 10:42.080]  where you wouldn't even have been in that
[10:42.080 --> 10:44.040]  when if you were allowed to still be able to use cannabis.
[10:44.040 --> 10:45.680]  I've seen different guys get in situations
[10:45.680 --> 10:46.520]  when they're in the drug program
[10:46.520 --> 10:48.040]  where they started doing things
[10:48.040 --> 10:49.520]  they would never normally do.
[10:49.520 --> 10:50.920]  And they were just like completely different people.
[10:50.920 --> 10:54.700]  And honestly, I think that with the NFL program,
[10:54.700 --> 10:57.020]  they kind of do more detriment than they do good
[10:57.020 --> 10:59.540]  when they restrict us and then try to tell you what to do.
[10:59.540 --> 11:00.580]  This is how you need to act.
[11:00.580 --> 11:01.780]  And you got to follow these rules
[11:01.780 --> 11:03.500]  and you can't act like everybody else,
[11:03.500 --> 11:04.500]  even though you're no a person,
[11:04.500 --> 11:06.280]  but you got to act this certain way.
[11:06.280 --> 11:09.780]  Meanwhile, some of the guys that get writing the checks,
[11:09.780 --> 11:12.300]  they do some of the wildest stuff you can imagine.
[11:12.300 --> 11:13.140]  No.
[11:17.780 --> 11:19.680]  You guys ever watched Ballers before?
[11:21.140 --> 11:23.940]  I live in Miami, so that shows pretty accurate.
[11:24.820 --> 11:27.140]  Awesome.
[11:27.140 --> 11:28.580]  Well, no, I agree with you too, man.
[11:28.580 --> 11:30.700]  And really that makes a poignant point.
[11:30.700 --> 11:32.560]  When you are caught using cannabis,
[11:32.560 --> 11:34.600]  you're almost then put over a threshold
[11:34.600 --> 11:36.900]  to have to take opiates for pain
[11:36.900 --> 11:38.900]  because you can't use a natural remedy.
[11:40.220 --> 11:41.940]  There's a friend of mine named Marvin Washington
[11:41.940 --> 11:42.780]  that played as well.
[11:42.780 --> 11:44.620]  And I think he's in the process
[11:44.620 --> 11:47.540]  of filing some form of lawsuit against the NFL
[11:47.540 --> 11:50.900]  for forced addiction when they don't give you a solution.
[11:50.900 --> 11:52.740]  And yeah, it really does.
[11:52.740 --> 11:57.140]  It sadly pushes you guys when you have no other option.
[11:57.140 --> 11:58.260]  Pills are the only thing to do
[11:58.260 --> 11:59.660]  when you're playing that hard and being hurt.
[11:59.660 --> 12:03.100]  So cheers to you and congrats on retirement.
[12:06.740 --> 12:09.740]  Okay, so quickly I'll go over what I do
[12:09.740 --> 12:12.900]  in the athletics and cannabis field very quickly.
[12:12.900 --> 12:15.580]  I put on an athletic tour around the country,
[12:15.580 --> 12:17.380]  somewhat like Tough Mudder or Spartan Race
[12:17.380 --> 12:19.020]  called the 420 Games.
[12:19.020 --> 12:22.060]  We compete, we do yoga, 4.20 mile runs,
[12:22.380 --> 12:23.940]  we do jiu-jitsu, big owl coached
[12:23.940 --> 12:25.580]  a three-on-three basketball tournament
[12:25.580 --> 12:27.620]  here in Venice last March.
[12:27.620 --> 12:29.500]  And so we go out and we do the opposite
[12:29.500 --> 12:31.260]  of what people think when they hear cannabis.
[12:31.260 --> 12:34.900]  We go and be active, we bring our families, our kids,
[12:34.900 --> 12:36.140]  and we don't smoke at the events.
[12:36.140 --> 12:38.000]  And we talk about stuff like this at the events,
[12:38.000 --> 12:40.500]  things like cannabis is an alternative to opiates.
[12:41.500 --> 12:44.300]  I have an edible line called Cannathlete,
[12:44.300 --> 12:45.540]  and it's an edible product.
[12:45.540 --> 12:48.260]  It's a spray for before you work out for focus.
[12:48.260 --> 12:50.880]  And it's a post-recovery serum.
[12:50.880 --> 12:53.680]  And then lastly, I tried very hard last year
[12:53.680 --> 12:56.520]  to open the world's first cannabis gym with Ricky Williams.
[12:56.520 --> 12:58.800]  It was called Power Plant Fitness.
[12:58.800 --> 13:00.320]  It's a venture on the shelf that we hope
[13:00.320 --> 13:02.620]  to eventually bring into fruition
[13:02.620 --> 13:05.180]  where the trainers understand how to use cannabis
[13:05.180 --> 13:08.680]  and help you figure out if it is or it isn't for you.
[13:08.680 --> 13:11.200]  And that's an important point I wanna touch on.
[13:11.200 --> 13:14.640]  I don't think cannabis on, well actually I'm gonna back up.
[13:14.640 --> 13:17.860]  There are really two ways athletes can use cannabis.
[13:17.860 --> 13:20.800]  You can really delineate it in two very defined manners.
[13:21.640 --> 13:24.840]  And one, most people understand is recovery, CBD.
[13:24.840 --> 13:26.960]  You hurt, you smoke, you feel better.
[13:26.960 --> 13:28.520]  And we're gonna go into that for sure today
[13:28.520 --> 13:29.960]  on the opiate side of things.
[13:29.960 --> 13:32.220]  But I've always enjoyed it for focus.
[13:32.220 --> 13:34.360]  I've always liked to smoke before I go into the gym,
[13:34.360 --> 13:37.200]  before I swim, before I ski, before I surf.
[13:37.200 --> 13:39.720]  And it gives me something that's a focus
[13:39.720 --> 13:41.400]  that I don't normally have.
[13:41.400 --> 13:43.600]  It really translates across my life with ADD.
[13:43.600 --> 13:46.320]  Like when I was in college, I smoked to write my term papers
[13:46.320 --> 13:48.620]  and I just needed it almost for a focus,
[13:48.620 --> 13:51.760]  i.e. a medicine versus to get high.
[13:51.760 --> 13:53.180]  So there's really two ways.
[13:53.180 --> 13:55.180]  Focus, athletes can use it for training
[13:55.180 --> 13:58.200]  or during athletics or they can use it for recovery.
[13:59.180 --> 14:03.040]  So I wanted to just kinda actually, like Matt for example,
[14:03.040 --> 14:05.700]  did you ever use cannabis during your career
[14:05.700 --> 14:08.180]  when you were training or during a game?
[14:08.180 --> 14:13.180]  Yeah, Jim, both of the categories you just mentioned
[14:13.340 --> 14:15.800]  used it for and so did a lot of the guys.
[14:16.760 --> 14:18.880]  I don't know, I mean, in our sport,
[14:18.880 --> 14:23.880]  I would imagine the numbers have gotta be 60% of the players
[14:23.960 --> 14:26.120]  and probably you're higher maybe, huh?
[14:26.120 --> 14:26.960]  I would say like 85.
[14:26.960 --> 14:29.320]  In an NBA, it's probably what, like 95?
[14:29.320 --> 14:30.720]  I mean.
[14:30.720 --> 14:31.600]  Point nine.
[14:31.600 --> 14:35.760]  Yeah, I mean, it's, you know, either way,
[14:35.760 --> 14:38.340]  it's a significant amount of people that benefit
[14:38.340 --> 14:41.100]  from using this for both of those areas.
[14:41.100 --> 14:44.560]  I did and I saw a lot of guys do it, Jim.
[14:45.960 --> 14:47.800]  Anyone else wanna chime in on focus,
[14:47.800 --> 14:50.520]  the aspect of using cannabis to get the,
[14:50.520 --> 14:52.220]  what I call, eye of the tiger?
[14:53.720 --> 14:55.320]  Me in particular, I like to use it to focus.
[14:55.320 --> 14:56.440]  For me, it's like it takes away
[14:56.440 --> 14:58.320]  the nervousness and the butterflies.
[14:58.320 --> 15:00.480]  So it just kinda makes it feel like you do
[15:00.480 --> 15:01.720]  or go out there every day and practice.
[15:01.720 --> 15:04.800]  There's another day, nothing out of the ordinary.
[15:04.800 --> 15:06.880]  Makes everything normal, easy.
[15:06.880 --> 15:09.240]  What I like to liken it to is to everything in life,
[15:09.240 --> 15:10.720]  there's something called flow state
[15:10.720 --> 15:13.620]  and whether you're an athlete, whether you're a musician,
[15:13.620 --> 15:16.140]  whether you're an artist, having sex, anything,
[15:16.140 --> 15:17.980]  when you're just, your mind goes away
[15:17.980 --> 15:20.100]  and your body just becomes one with your mind.
[15:20.100 --> 15:21.680]  That's called flow state.
[15:21.680 --> 15:24.700]  That's why artists have always been kind of let,
[15:24.700 --> 15:26.980]  you know, let to be that sect that used cannabis
[15:26.980 --> 15:30.660]  and psychedelics and even the surf community and whatnot.
[15:30.660 --> 15:32.500]  So flow state is something, again,
[15:32.500 --> 15:34.860]  I like to translate this beyond just athletics
[15:34.860 --> 15:37.940]  and why cannabis really, it's good for athletes and fitness
[15:37.940 --> 15:39.780]  but it correlates across our whole life
[15:39.780 --> 15:42.260]  to allow us to enjoy things like athletics.
[15:42.260 --> 15:43.900]  It makes the things you love,
[15:43.900 --> 15:45.340]  it allows you to love them a little bit more
[15:45.340 --> 15:47.300]  and appreciate them a little bit more.
[15:48.540 --> 15:52.140]  So on the focus side of things,
[15:52.140 --> 15:53.340]  I think we kinda covered it.
[15:53.340 --> 15:55.080]  I think, you know, Al, you've mentioned before
[15:55.080 --> 15:57.620]  you don't like to use cannabis before you train
[15:57.620 --> 15:59.260]  and again, I wanna hear from Al
[15:59.260 --> 16:01.800]  because I don't think everybody should use cannabis
[16:01.800 --> 16:03.500]  and it's important to hear from someone
[16:03.500 --> 16:05.680]  who maybe it doesn't affect in the best way
[16:05.680 --> 16:07.540]  before they get in the gym.
[16:07.540 --> 16:10.580]  Yeah, for me, so I'm an indica smoker.
[16:10.620 --> 16:12.620]  So I like to smoke the heavy stuff
[16:12.620 --> 16:14.560]  so I can go sit down and chill out.
[16:14.560 --> 16:16.580]  So that's the reason why for me, like, you know,
[16:16.580 --> 16:18.900]  obviously for me to consume right before
[16:18.900 --> 16:21.300]  trying to do anything, especially athletics
[16:21.300 --> 16:23.020]  is probably not the right thing.
[16:23.020 --> 16:25.620]  Now, most people say, why don't you try sativas?
[16:25.620 --> 16:29.620]  So I've tried sativas and then sativas make my heart race.
[16:29.620 --> 16:31.260]  So I was in a lose-lose.
[16:31.260 --> 16:34.980]  So that's why I actually choose not to consume before
[16:34.980 --> 16:38.100]  but, you know, I don't knock it.
[16:38.100 --> 16:41.300]  I've actually started to be able to kind of control it now,
[16:41.300 --> 16:42.620]  you know, because I use so much,
[16:42.620 --> 16:46.060]  or I've, you know, I've been using this a lot.
[16:46.060 --> 16:48.740]  So like now I actually can smoke indicas
[16:48.740 --> 16:50.140]  and actually get stuff done.
[16:50.140 --> 16:52.540]  I have four kids, so I have to medicate
[16:52.540 --> 16:54.180]  before I deal with them.
[16:54.180 --> 16:58.620]  So I've changed a little bit, Joe, for sure.
[16:58.620 --> 17:00.380]  Nice, I like that.
[17:00.380 --> 17:01.220]  Flow state parenting.
[17:01.220 --> 17:02.300]  Another point on that, Joe,
[17:02.300 --> 17:04.840]  and the interesting thing is just being able to figure out
[17:04.840 --> 17:05.820]  what works for you
[17:05.820 --> 17:08.540]  because the amount of products
[17:08.540 --> 17:10.620]  that are coming to the market now,
[17:10.620 --> 17:13.340]  you can sort of experiment and do just what Al did
[17:13.340 --> 17:15.220]  and no one person is alike.
[17:15.220 --> 17:17.580]  I mean, our chemical makeup is so different.
[17:18.580 --> 17:20.220]  Our systems work so different
[17:20.220 --> 17:22.140]  that it's just important to continue to figure out
[17:22.140 --> 17:24.780]  what works for you in what environment.
[17:24.780 --> 17:26.660]  Yeah, you know, that's something I wanted to touch on.
[17:26.660 --> 17:30.020]  And I think, Al, if indicas, you know,
[17:30.020 --> 17:31.980]  are more sleepy and heavy to you,
[17:31.980 --> 17:33.940]  that's a great way that you know yourself,
[17:33.940 --> 17:35.340]  you know what you want in your medicine
[17:35.860 --> 17:36.700]  and you know when to use it.
[17:36.700 --> 17:40.220]  And to me, the one thing I'd like to try and debunk
[17:40.220 --> 17:41.700]  to as much as I can,
[17:41.700 --> 17:44.220]  we've got Dr. Sue Sisley here in the front row today.
[17:44.220 --> 17:46.540]  Hey, Dr. Sue, let's give Sue a hand.
[17:47.920 --> 17:50.020]  I might even ask Sue a question right now.
[17:51.180 --> 17:53.940]  But, you know, there's a long myth, in my opinion,
[17:53.940 --> 17:56.780]  that indica means one thing and sativa means the other,
[17:56.780 --> 17:59.300]  meaning that indica's head heavy and it makes you sleepy
[17:59.300 --> 18:03.700]  and a sativa is an energizing cannabis result.
[18:03.740 --> 18:05.940]  And what Matt just said is, truthfully,
[18:05.940 --> 18:07.300]  to me what's most important.
[18:07.300 --> 18:09.580]  Everybody, especially, I'm saying this
[18:09.580 --> 18:12.260]  because we're talking about fitness and cannabis,
[18:12.260 --> 18:14.900]  knowing what works for you is way more important
[18:14.900 --> 18:18.180]  than, hey bro, do you have an indica or a sativa?
[18:18.180 --> 18:20.540]  So it's like understanding your body type
[18:20.540 --> 18:21.820]  and then how cannabis works.
[18:21.820 --> 18:25.060]  But, you know, from a science standpoint,
[18:25.060 --> 18:27.100]  the myth has really been shown
[18:27.100 --> 18:30.300]  that indica does not necessarily mean one thing
[18:30.300 --> 18:31.260]  and sativa doesn't.
[18:31.260 --> 18:33.140]  And the easiest way to understand that
[18:33.580 --> 18:35.020]  is two people can smoke the same plant
[18:35.020 --> 18:36.740]  and they feel completely opposite.
[18:36.740 --> 18:38.860]  So it's really about knowing yourself,
[18:38.860 --> 18:40.340]  especially within athletics,
[18:40.340 --> 18:42.900]  in terms of what type of cannabis you use and when.
[18:45.100 --> 18:45.940]  E, what about you?
[18:45.940 --> 18:47.700]  I'd love to chime in on this one
[18:47.700 --> 18:50.020]  because it's something I love talking about.
[18:50.020 --> 18:51.420]  But it's really interesting to see
[18:51.420 --> 18:53.880]  that it's really not indica, sativa anymore.
[18:53.880 --> 18:55.740]  And now that we're learning so much about terpenes
[18:55.740 --> 18:56.860]  and different cannabinoids
[18:56.860 --> 19:00.580]  and even how our endocannabinoid receptor system works.
[19:00.700 --> 19:05.140]  There's so much research that has not happened yet, right?
[19:05.140 --> 19:06.780]  Because it has been federally illegal.
[19:06.780 --> 19:09.340]  So this is something that we're just now
[19:09.340 --> 19:10.860]  touching the surface.
[19:10.860 --> 19:13.500]  And it's really important to understand
[19:13.500 --> 19:15.020]  that there are different ways
[19:15.020 --> 19:17.260]  to also apply cannabis to your workout.
[19:17.260 --> 19:20.820]  I mean, it sounds like you should be using topicals.
[19:20.820 --> 19:23.220]  Like topicals are amazing
[19:23.220 --> 19:26.180]  and people don't give it enough credit.
[19:26.180 --> 19:28.660]  There's so many ways for your body to benefit from cannabis
[19:28.660 --> 19:32.260]  as well as tinctures, understanding CBD versus CBN
[19:32.260 --> 19:35.460]  and how you can use blends and creating your own blend.
[19:35.460 --> 19:36.540]  It really goes deep.
[19:36.540 --> 19:38.160]  And I don't wanna go off on a tangent,
[19:38.160 --> 19:40.900]  but just pointing out that there's so much more
[19:40.900 --> 19:43.140]  than just smoking or vaping nowadays.
[19:43.140 --> 19:45.300]  And it's really a blessing
[19:45.300 --> 19:46.720]  that we have all of these options.
[19:46.720 --> 19:49.180]  Even patches I've been seeing lately.
[19:49.180 --> 19:50.300]  Well, yeah, and what I take from you
[19:50.300 --> 19:53.660]  dialing it right into this is that
[19:53.660 --> 19:55.340]  you really have a lot of options
[19:55.340 --> 19:57.840]  to choose exactly what type of medicine
[19:57.840 --> 19:59.920]  to get you where you want to be.
[19:59.920 --> 20:04.640]  And so again, I just think it's starting slow is important.
[20:04.640 --> 20:07.980]  And in this room, just a show of hands, I'm interested.
[20:07.980 --> 20:10.420]  Who likes to use cannabis before they go for a run
[20:10.420 --> 20:11.920]  or they do something athletic?
[20:13.020 --> 20:14.600]  So it's about half and half.
[20:14.600 --> 20:16.240]  Very interesting.
[20:16.240 --> 20:17.400]  All right.
[20:17.400 --> 20:22.080]  Well, so cannabis has also been proven
[20:22.080 --> 20:23.500]  to be a neuroprotectant.
[20:23.500 --> 20:25.280]  And that's something I kinda wanna touch on
[20:25.280 --> 20:27.720]  and delve into the CBD side of things.
[20:28.720 --> 20:32.120]  We've got big ex-pro athletes that played football here,
[20:32.120 --> 20:33.320]  and then we've got a yogi,
[20:33.320 --> 20:35.180]  and we've got Al who played basketball
[20:35.180 --> 20:37.000]  where you get banged around pretty darn good.
[20:37.000 --> 20:39.960]  And so we all use CBD in different ways
[20:39.960 --> 20:41.440]  in a recovery facet.
[20:41.440 --> 20:44.280]  But Matt, do you wanna talk a little bit
[20:44.280 --> 20:46.000]  about CBD as a neuroprotectant
[20:46.000 --> 20:48.240]  and how like a football player uses CBD
[20:48.240 --> 20:52.260]  both prior to injury as well as post-traumatic injury?
[20:52.260 --> 20:54.640]  Yeah, that would be, I'd love to talk about that.
[20:55.000 --> 20:58.080]  In particular, as my father was a pro football player
[20:58.080 --> 21:03.080]  and as was I, I grew up around all of these players
[21:03.960 --> 21:05.360]  from the 60s and 70s.
[21:05.360 --> 21:10.360]  So I get to see at 50, 60, 70 years old, the repercussions.
[21:11.460 --> 21:13.880]  And these guys are in tremendous amounts of pain.
[21:13.880 --> 21:16.520]  Almost none of them aren't in some kind of pain
[21:16.520 --> 21:18.440]  and head trauma is a lot of it.
[21:19.360 --> 21:21.320]  Maybe we ought to give Dr. Sue more money
[21:21.320 --> 21:23.000]  so she can figure some of these things out.
[21:23.000 --> 21:28.000]  But to see my generation now,
[21:28.120 --> 21:31.680]  see the past generations downfall
[21:31.680 --> 21:33.360]  and you've seen the movies.
[21:33.360 --> 21:36.280]  I mean, it's a really important topic for us all
[21:36.280 --> 21:37.160]  to think about.
[21:37.160 --> 21:42.160]  CBD is a great way to do it, a non-psychoactive molecule.
[21:42.400 --> 21:44.920]  You can derive it from hemp or cannabis.
[21:44.920 --> 21:47.720]  And with Mitch McConnell's efforts,
[21:47.720 --> 21:51.600]  we're about to have hemp legal federally, thank God.
[21:52.400 --> 21:53.640]  We think very soon.
[21:53.640 --> 21:55.800]  So it's gonna be tough for the NFL
[21:55.800 --> 21:58.120]  to not recognize that in other sports.
[21:59.200 --> 22:03.000]  But I think that there's a lot of different types of CBD.
[22:03.000 --> 22:05.080]  As she talked about, you kind of have to figure out
[22:05.080 --> 22:06.200]  which one's good for you.
[22:06.200 --> 22:08.280]  There's some great brands we can suggest.
[22:09.280 --> 22:11.640]  I think as a neuroprotector,
[22:13.400 --> 22:18.060]  I'd see guys using it literally 10 minutes before game time.
[22:18.060 --> 22:20.080]  And it's because CBD doesn't take away
[22:20.120 --> 22:23.960]  from their ability to use their minds as much as THC might.
[22:23.960 --> 22:27.160]  So I've seen that, but I've also seen, Jim,
[22:27.160 --> 22:31.320]  a lot of guys using it on Mondays, day after games,
[22:31.320 --> 22:33.900]  to do more of the rehabilitation efforts.
[22:33.900 --> 22:36.720]  And I think rather than being pumped full
[22:36.720 --> 22:39.920]  of all these medicines that they would prefer to give you,
[22:39.920 --> 22:41.120]  which I know you can talk about,
[22:41.120 --> 22:42.760]  and Dr. Sue and Mike James,
[22:42.760 --> 22:45.120]  who's got some great stories out there, can tell you about.
[22:45.120 --> 22:47.080]  And I've get, playing football,
[22:47.080 --> 22:49.680]  I can't tell you how many of these minor concussions
[22:50.280 --> 22:51.120]  you get.
[22:51.120 --> 22:51.940]  I mean, every time you get hit,
[22:51.940 --> 22:52.880]  you just assume you shake it off,
[22:52.880 --> 22:54.440]  but they're little concussions.
[22:54.440 --> 22:56.360]  And we've all had the real ones.
[22:56.360 --> 22:59.060]  I mean, they knock you, lights out's a real thing.
[22:59.060 --> 23:02.440]  And so if CBD can be helpful in these efforts,
[23:03.320 --> 23:05.160]  it's something we all need to consider.
[23:05.160 --> 23:06.400]  I think CBD is really important
[23:06.400 --> 23:07.520]  when it comes to the neuro stuff,
[23:07.520 --> 23:09.160]  because Mike is a good friend of mine.
[23:09.160 --> 23:10.320]  We actually trained and do rehab
[23:10.320 --> 23:11.440]  down in the same place in Miami.
[23:11.440 --> 23:14.400]  So I've seen firsthand him recovering from the concussions
[23:14.400 --> 23:15.440]  and having to wear the glasses.
[23:15.440 --> 23:16.960]  And I've had a couple of concussions myself,
[23:16.960 --> 23:19.580]  and I've had concussions that I know weren't documented,
[23:20.480 --> 23:22.620]  but I know I've had, I definitely had over 10.
[23:22.620 --> 23:23.820]  So sometimes every now and then,
[23:23.820 --> 23:26.220]  I'll get little headaches in the front of my head.
[23:26.220 --> 23:29.180]  When I take my sublingual CBD and things like that,
[23:29.180 --> 23:30.140]  the pressure will go away.
[23:30.140 --> 23:33.300]  Or any anxiety and stuff like that,
[23:33.300 --> 23:35.340]  just from all the head trauma and contact,
[23:35.340 --> 23:37.940]  it helps with the relief of that a lot.
[23:37.940 --> 23:39.160]  And I hear that from a lot of guys now.
[23:39.160 --> 23:41.340]  So that's, more and more people are kind of reaching out,
[23:41.340 --> 23:43.140]  trying to find out more and more about CBD
[23:43.140 --> 23:44.540]  and see how they can get their hands on it
[23:44.540 --> 23:46.700]  and how to treat their symptoms.
[23:46.700 --> 23:49.340]  Al, you know, you're quite the entrepreneur
[23:49.340 --> 23:51.540]  and I've admired your rise in the industry
[23:51.540 --> 23:54.460]  with your brands and Viola and everything else.
[23:54.460 --> 23:58.140]  So when we talk about CBD, something I think as an athlete,
[23:58.140 --> 23:59.940]  and again, translating across the board,
[23:59.940 --> 24:02.080]  but especially for recovery,
[24:02.080 --> 24:04.020]  there's something called whole plant medicine.
[24:04.020 --> 24:05.700]  And you can take CBD.
[24:05.700 --> 24:08.220]  CBD has become a buzzword in the general public.
[24:08.220 --> 24:10.420]  And half the time, like quite honestly,
[24:10.420 --> 24:11.900]  it's like when you buy organic food,
[24:11.900 --> 24:13.540]  I wonder like, is this really organic
[24:13.540 --> 24:15.060]  or do they just put that on the box?
[24:15.060 --> 24:18.340]  So it's really important, like with all of your food in life,
[24:18.340 --> 24:20.960]  food is medicine, is how I'm gonna end this today.
[24:20.960 --> 24:22.500]  Know where your medicine comes from.
[24:22.500 --> 24:23.980]  Just because something says CBD
[24:23.980 --> 24:25.060]  doesn't mean it's good for you
[24:25.060 --> 24:26.840]  and it doesn't even mean there's CBD in it.
[24:26.840 --> 24:28.880]  So know where you're getting your medicine.
[24:28.880 --> 24:31.380]  And people like Al, who are doing it the right way,
[24:31.380 --> 24:33.920]  tested whole plant medicine as an option
[24:33.920 --> 24:36.480]  where people, you know, you don't have to take THC,
[24:36.480 --> 24:38.460]  but when you ratio it with THC
[24:38.460 --> 24:40.840]  and whether it's an 18 to one to CBD,
[24:40.840 --> 24:42.980]  and it's a very low amount of THC,
[24:42.980 --> 24:45.920]  using the whole plant versus an extract
[24:45.920 --> 24:48.540]  can be much times, it's called the entourage effect,
[24:48.540 --> 24:51.220]  and it's a lot more beneficial sometimes medicinally
[24:51.220 --> 24:53.820]  to have that combination of the whole plant.
[24:53.820 --> 24:55.420]  Do you wanna talk a little bit about,
[24:55.420 --> 24:58.780]  you know, excuse me, whole plant medicine?
[24:58.780 --> 25:01.020]  Yeah, so, you know, so like you said,
[25:01.020 --> 25:03.100]  you know, for me, obviously, you know,
[25:03.100 --> 25:04.180]  when we first started,
[25:05.160 --> 25:07.220]  I had to go through the education process.
[25:07.220 --> 25:11.180]  And, you know, my, I had knee,
[25:11.180 --> 25:14.220]  the first knee surgery I had, I think was in 2001.
[25:14.220 --> 25:17.460]  And from 2001 to 2009,
[25:17.460 --> 25:19.980]  I used to take anti-inflammatories
[25:19.980 --> 25:23.960]  like Celebrex, Advil every day.
[25:23.960 --> 25:26.260]  Like I was taking one in the morning, one at night,
[25:26.260 --> 25:28.100]  whether it was during the season or, you know,
[25:28.100 --> 25:30.140]  or in the summertime when I was actually training
[25:30.140 --> 25:31.820]  to get ready for the season.
[25:31.820 --> 25:34.380]  And we all know like, you know, the potential side effects,
[25:34.380 --> 25:36.620]  you know, and I looked at them, I knew what they were,
[25:36.620 --> 25:39.100]  but, you know, like a lot of us on this panel,
[25:39.100 --> 25:40.860]  you know, especially athletes, you know,
[25:41.540 --> 25:42.380]  this is a way to make a living.
[25:42.380 --> 25:45.500]  So you kind of got to put your body in those positions
[25:45.500 --> 25:47.620]  or in those predicaments and kind of just have to see
[25:47.620 --> 25:49.980]  what happens because you're providing for your family
[25:49.980 --> 25:51.300]  and stuff like that.
[25:51.300 --> 25:52.940]  But once I got introduced to cannabis
[25:52.940 --> 25:57.060]  and I realized I had an all natural, you know, option,
[25:57.060 --> 25:59.340]  you know, it spun me for a loop.
[25:59.340 --> 26:03.020]  Because I was just like, how can these professional teams
[26:03.020 --> 26:05.060]  say that they have our best interests at heart,
[26:05.060 --> 26:08.000]  but they don't want to give us something that, you know,
[26:08.000 --> 26:10.620]  that we could take that is without all the, you know,
[26:11.380 --> 26:12.300]  potential side effects of, you know,
[26:12.300 --> 26:14.460]  I always laugh about when we look at these commercials
[26:14.460 --> 26:16.500]  of these new drugs that come online,
[26:16.500 --> 26:18.900]  and it's just like, you know, people skipping, you know,
[26:18.900 --> 26:21.900]  to a sunset and everything is just so happy.
[26:21.900 --> 26:24.380]  And then at the end it's like side effects,
[26:24.380 --> 26:27.640]  instant death, internal bleeding, eyeballs falling out.
[26:29.180 --> 26:31.380]  And you think about what cannabis, we have none of that,
[26:31.380 --> 26:33.860]  you know, and, you know, for me, like I said, you know,
[26:33.860 --> 26:36.100]  it started with my grandmother, then me,
[26:36.100 --> 26:37.980]  and now it's like my whole family,
[26:37.980 --> 26:40.340]  like literally my whole family consumes.
[26:40.340 --> 26:42.700]  My aunt just went through about a breast cancer,
[26:42.700 --> 26:45.220]  went through chemo, you know, I gave her Rick Simpson oil
[26:45.220 --> 26:47.380]  that, you know, one of my friends produced for her.
[26:47.380 --> 26:50.860]  She actually gained weight, you know, throughout the process.
[26:50.860 --> 26:53.280]  My grandmother's church, you know, obviously, you know,
[26:53.280 --> 26:54.660]  she's 80 something years old,
[26:54.660 --> 26:56.680]  and all her friends are 80 something years old,
[26:56.680 --> 26:58.980]  so they're getting knee replacements and hip replacements,
[26:58.980 --> 27:02.300]  and she's always calling me out, what can they take?
[27:02.300 --> 27:04.220]  So now my grandma's actually the biggest drug dealer
[27:04.220 --> 27:05.060]  in our church.
[27:05.620 --> 27:07.320]  That's what she's transitioned to.
[27:08.180 --> 27:09.620]  But then you're a medicine woman, right?
[27:09.620 --> 27:12.340]  She's also the most popular person in our church.
[27:12.340 --> 27:15.020]  Exactly, but yeah, but you know,
[27:15.020 --> 27:17.380]  ever since I've learned this, you know, my daughter,
[27:17.380 --> 27:20.420]  you know, literally I just last week started putting
[27:20.420 --> 27:24.300]  my daughter on a CBD regimen, you know, she has ADHD,
[27:24.300 --> 27:27.620]  and, you know, watching her personality swings
[27:27.620 --> 27:30.260]  and different things like that, and being that, you know,
[27:30.260 --> 27:33.460]  we're giving her a drug that I fully don't even understand.
[27:33.460 --> 27:35.660]  And, you know, when I really think about it,
[27:35.660 --> 27:38.260]  the course that we're setting her on is that
[27:38.260 --> 27:41.380]  she will be taking pills for the rest of her life.
[27:41.380 --> 27:44.260]  So I gotta stop that, and I'm gonna try to stop it
[27:44.260 --> 27:46.780]  through this plant, and we're gonna see what cannabis does,
[27:46.780 --> 27:47.740]  we're gonna start, like she said,
[27:47.740 --> 27:49.060]  we're gonna start messing with blends
[27:49.060 --> 27:50.620]  and different things like that,
[27:50.620 --> 27:53.260]  and we're gonna try to heal her all naturally.
[27:53.260 --> 27:55.180]  It'll work.
[27:55.180 --> 27:56.100]  It'll work.
[27:56.100 --> 27:57.020]  It'll work.
[27:57.020 --> 27:57.860]  It'll work.
[27:57.860 --> 27:59.620]  For the ADHD?
[27:59.620 --> 28:01.780]  I have ADHD, so when I was in college,
[28:01.780 --> 28:03.860]  I was diagnosed, my head coach actually suggested
[28:03.860 --> 28:06.620]  I get tested for it, and that was one of my ways,
[28:06.620 --> 28:08.260]  one of my reasons for medicating was my ADD.
[28:08.260 --> 28:10.420]  It would help me focus and study my plays,
[28:10.420 --> 28:12.580]  because if I didn't smoke, there was no way
[28:12.580 --> 28:14.500]  I could sit still and actually sit there and study,
[28:14.500 --> 28:16.580]  I would go play the game, go out,
[28:16.580 --> 28:18.980]  and then that was big for my ADD.
[28:18.980 --> 28:21.140]  And I was on medication in the league,
[28:21.140 --> 28:23.140]  I was on Ritalin, so I was dehydrated,
[28:23.140 --> 28:25.140]  my heart rate would go up, during practice
[28:25.140 --> 28:27.980]  I'd be sweating so much, like my hands would be clammy,
[28:27.980 --> 28:31.180]  I'd have to drink Pedialyte, I had all the symptoms,
[28:31.700 --> 28:34.100]  I would take 30 milligrams twice a day.
[28:34.100 --> 28:35.940]  Isn't that how it works though, right?
[28:35.940 --> 28:38.340]  If you take your kid into the doctor
[28:38.340 --> 28:42.100]  and bouncing around too much, oh ADD,
[28:42.100 --> 28:43.620]  you need to get him Adderall.
[28:43.620 --> 28:45.580]  You take your kid and he's not bouncing around,
[28:45.580 --> 28:47.180]  oh my gosh, he's depressed, we're gonna need
[28:47.180 --> 28:48.820]  to put him on some antidepressants.
[28:48.820 --> 28:49.900]  I mean, you can't get out of there
[28:49.900 --> 28:52.460]  without something it feels like, it's ridiculous.
[28:53.860 --> 28:56.540]  Yeah, it is, it's sad, I really hate that.
[28:56.540 --> 28:59.100]  I'm trying to naturally teach my family
[28:59.100 --> 29:02.340]  an Eastern philosophy of medicine versus a Western.
[29:03.700 --> 29:07.580]  All drugs aren't bad, I've talked so much bad stuff
[29:07.580 --> 29:11.140]  about the pharmaceutical industry, I wanna say one thing.
[29:11.140 --> 29:13.480]  We're lucky to live in a place where technology,
[29:13.480 --> 29:15.940]  surgery, and even medicine, pharmaceutically,
[29:15.940 --> 29:18.100]  can keep us alive longer and help us.
[29:18.100 --> 29:21.320]  But it's so goddamn overused, that's the problem,
[29:21.320 --> 29:24.420]  that cannabis can, there's a place for opiates.
[29:24.420 --> 29:27.020]  When you're hurt and you're really, really, really hurt,
[29:27.020 --> 29:28.060]  there's a place for it.
[29:28.060 --> 29:32.020]  But really, you can use cannabis to really accentuate
[29:32.020 --> 29:36.120]  and as a complement to those type of pharmaceuticals
[29:36.120 --> 29:38.860]  when you have to take them, thereby reducing
[29:38.860 --> 29:41.860]  the amount of pharmaceuticals that you have to take as well.
[29:44.100 --> 29:46.900]  So interesting, that's a cool story about your daughter.
[29:46.900 --> 29:49.740]  I'm looking into, my daughter's just like me with ADHD
[29:49.740 --> 29:50.980]  and we're trying to figure out ways
[29:50.980 --> 29:53.380]  to get her to calm down as well.
[29:53.380 --> 29:54.780]  I'll let you know what I figure out.
[29:54.780 --> 29:55.740]  Yeah, please do.
[29:59.060 --> 30:01.340]  So, this isn't a new thing.
[30:01.340 --> 30:04.020]  I like to always point out, when I started
[30:04.020 --> 30:06.780]  the 420 Games a few years ago, it was like this big,
[30:06.780 --> 30:08.860]  wow, we've never seen anything like this,
[30:08.860 --> 30:11.460]  athletes and marijuana, oh my gosh.
[30:11.460 --> 30:14.180]  But it wasn't, it's like a secret fraternity
[30:14.180 --> 30:16.220]  that we all were in for all these decades,
[30:16.220 --> 30:18.940]  especially these guys, they all knew that they,
[30:18.940 --> 30:20.740]  inside the locker room, that they used weed,
[30:20.740 --> 30:21.940]  but they couldn't talk about it.
[30:21.940 --> 30:24.420]  And I couldn't talk about it, because I was an executive
[30:24.420 --> 30:26.980]  and people could get blacked out at our Christmas parties,
[30:27.100 --> 30:30.140]  but God forbid I lit a joint, I would be an outcast.
[30:30.140 --> 30:35.140]  So, it's, and so I looked back as I started to do this,
[30:36.940 --> 30:38.660]  because I was a closeted cannabis user
[30:38.660 --> 30:40.620]  since I played soccer in high school,
[30:40.620 --> 30:42.700]  and I was the starting pitcher in my baseball team
[30:42.700 --> 30:45.580]  and all that, and I looked, and you know,
[30:45.580 --> 30:48.260]  Pumping Iron, Lou Ferrigno, and Arnold Schwarzenegger
[30:48.260 --> 30:50.580]  in the early 70s, they were smoking weed at the gym
[30:50.580 --> 30:52.380]  when they were competing for Mr. Universe,
[30:52.380 --> 30:55.900]  the most prestigious bodybuilding contest in the world.
[30:55.900 --> 30:57.900]  You know, we've got Phelps, Usain,
[30:57.900 --> 30:59.980]  the fastest in land and water ever,
[30:59.980 --> 31:02.620]  those were both known cannabis users.
[31:02.620 --> 31:04.580]  Got my man right here, Big Al.
[31:04.580 --> 31:07.380]  And the entire NBA, that's why I fisted Al,
[31:07.380 --> 31:09.940]  is you know, the NBA represents the most heavy cannabis
[31:09.940 --> 31:11.540]  using professional sports league,
[31:11.540 --> 31:13.300]  and they're the most incredible athletes
[31:13.300 --> 31:14.860]  that I like to watch more than any of them,
[31:14.860 --> 31:16.540]  so it's just, it makes us stand out.
[31:16.540 --> 31:18.140]  How many seasons was it for you, Al?
[31:18.140 --> 31:19.100]  17.
[31:19.100 --> 31:20.780]  That's a lot of seasons to play in.
[31:20.780 --> 31:21.620]  Grinder.
[31:21.620 --> 31:22.460]  Yeah.
[31:23.460 --> 31:24.300]  Thank God.
[31:24.300 --> 31:26.140]  I wasn't getting concussions, thank God.
[31:26.140 --> 31:27.220]  Yeah.
[31:27.220 --> 31:28.060]  For real.
[31:28.060 --> 31:28.900]  I was still playing, by the way.
[31:28.900 --> 31:29.740]  I wish I was 6'8".
[31:29.740 --> 31:31.100]  No, three on three still.
[31:35.040 --> 31:36.760]  Well, on that note, I wanna ask, you know,
[31:36.760 --> 31:38.640]  starting with Al, and then we can go down the line,
[31:38.640 --> 31:40.440]  or whoever wants to pop in, but to me,
[31:40.440 --> 31:44.320]  like a question as a proponent for the pro athletes
[31:44.320 --> 31:47.520]  is how do we get the professional athletes,
[31:47.520 --> 31:49.640]  the owners of these businesses and these teams
[31:49.640 --> 31:51.640]  to allow cannabis to be used?
[31:51.680 --> 31:54.840]  And I think we all kind of have seen CBD as our gateway.
[31:54.840 --> 31:57.520]  My statement, and my unfortunate reality,
[31:57.520 --> 31:58.840]  is that it's only gonna be money,
[31:58.840 --> 32:01.160]  and we need to, with data, prove that cannabis
[32:01.160 --> 32:03.440]  can actually be better medicine with people like Sue
[32:03.440 --> 32:05.480]  and her research to show that this will actually
[32:05.480 --> 32:07.400]  get you on the field and keep you playing longer,
[32:07.400 --> 32:08.960]  and they're not gonna really do it
[32:08.960 --> 32:11.520]  just because it makes somebody feel better.
[32:11.520 --> 32:13.200]  So what do you guys think?
[32:13.200 --> 32:15.360]  You know, how are we gonna get this legalized
[32:15.360 --> 32:18.000]  to use cannabis in the NFL and beyond?
[32:18.000 --> 32:19.480]  Well, I think the first thing you said is true.
[32:19.480 --> 32:21.760]  It's gonna take money, testing, Sue,
[32:21.760 --> 32:24.000]  you know what I'm saying, to continue to
[32:24.000 --> 32:26.960]  break down these barriers, but what I think,
[32:26.960 --> 32:29.120]  you know, like just say NBA guys, right?
[32:30.120 --> 32:32.360]  It's gonna take one of the top guys
[32:32.360 --> 32:34.040]  to come out and say he used.
[32:34.040 --> 32:35.480]  You know, and from the NFL, I always say,
[32:35.480 --> 32:38.880]  like if Tom Brady did it, but from the NBA,
[32:38.880 --> 32:40.400]  I personally think it's gonna happen
[32:40.400 --> 32:42.760]  sooner than later, too, because the league
[32:42.760 --> 32:44.840]  has changed a lot, and the way I say the league
[32:44.840 --> 32:45.920]  has changed a lot. Let's call LeBron.
[32:45.920 --> 32:46.760]  You got LeBron's number?
[32:46.760 --> 32:48.080]  I got LeBron, no, no, not LeBron,
[32:48.080 --> 32:49.320]  but I got somebody close to LeBron
[32:49.320 --> 32:50.840]  that's thinking about doing it,
[32:50.840 --> 32:54.200]  but you know, these guys are in a different stage
[32:54.200 --> 32:56.160]  in their lives, so like when I was coming up,
[32:56.160 --> 32:57.880]  just to say like, you know, there wasn't as much
[32:57.880 --> 33:00.000]  endorsement money and different things like that,
[33:00.000 --> 33:02.400]  but if there was, you know, he was tied to McDonald's
[33:02.400 --> 33:05.200]  and for a million dollars, and that was a lot of money,
[33:05.200 --> 33:07.520]  but now these guys are making $40 million
[33:07.520 --> 33:10.360]  just from their contract, and then they have
[33:10.360 --> 33:12.320]  all these endorsement deals and stuff like that,
[33:12.320 --> 33:16.040]  so I personally think that now they make so much money
[33:16.040 --> 33:17.720]  that they don't care no more.
[33:18.360 --> 33:20.080]  They like, I'm gonna be exactly who I am now.
[33:20.080 --> 33:23.560]  I don't have to hide who I am, and I personally think
[33:23.560 --> 33:26.240]  that, you know, there will be an NBA player
[33:26.240 --> 33:29.000]  that will make this statement within, I would say,
[33:29.000 --> 33:31.200]  like the next two years, and then I think
[33:31.200 --> 33:34.240]  that'll just continue to push the conversation forward,
[33:34.240 --> 33:36.560]  and we'll start, we got to continue to break down barriers,
[33:36.560 --> 33:39.840]  and then we need people like us who are retired athletes
[33:39.840 --> 33:41.840]  to speak our truths, and like you said,
[33:41.840 --> 33:44.280]  come out the weed closet or the green closet,
[33:44.280 --> 33:46.000]  and as we continue to do that, we just keep raising
[33:46.000 --> 33:49.320]  awareness, and we'll just keep breaking down barriers.
[33:49.320 --> 33:52.920]  That is great to hear, Al, and I think you're right.
[33:52.920 --> 33:54.560]  I mean, what a great world we live in now
[33:54.560 --> 33:56.120]  that everybody has a voice, right?
[33:56.120 --> 33:58.200]  I mean, you're seeing this across the board.
[33:58.200 --> 33:59.920]  People can be exactly who they are
[33:59.920 --> 34:02.280]  and not be so worried about it anymore,
[34:02.280 --> 34:05.920]  which is really the ultimate, I don't even know
[34:05.920 --> 34:08.920]  how to say it, but the ultimate responsibility
[34:08.920 --> 34:12.320]  that the cannabis industry has is to build an industry
[34:12.320 --> 34:15.140]  the right way from the beginning, female empowerment,
[34:15.140 --> 34:18.220]  sustainability, environmentally conscious.
[34:18.220 --> 34:20.660]  I mean, we get to do all this versus every other industry
[34:20.660 --> 34:23.740]  that's trying to reverse engineer themselves right now,
[34:23.740 --> 34:27.320]  so by speaking up, doing things right as we build this,
[34:27.320 --> 34:32.320]  it's not only our responsibility, but it's sort of a luxury,
[34:32.460 --> 34:34.780]  and it's great to hear that you think there's some big
[34:34.780 --> 34:37.780]  people about to say some things, and I think across
[34:37.780 --> 34:40.840]  the board, some big actors are about to do that,
[34:40.840 --> 34:43.220]  some NFL guys, I mean, I think we're gonna continue
[34:43.220 --> 34:46.820]  to see the chips fall as long as we get good research
[34:46.820 --> 34:51.820]  back from Dr. Sue that proves it all to be accurate.
[34:53.780 --> 34:56.440]  Well, my perspective is very much in line with yours.
[34:56.440 --> 35:00.960]  I would say that initially, we need education.
[35:00.960 --> 35:03.140]  We need to educate people the same way that you had
[35:03.140 --> 35:04.820]  to educate your grandmother and show her
[35:04.820 --> 35:06.660]  that this isn't something to be afraid of.
[35:06.660 --> 35:11.000]  It's our job as the cannabis community to come together
[35:11.040 --> 35:14.360]  and really take the time to go to your families
[35:14.360 --> 35:16.880]  and to explain to your kids what this is,
[35:16.880 --> 35:18.680]  explain to your parents what this is,
[35:18.680 --> 35:20.280]  explain to your grandparents what this is
[35:20.280 --> 35:23.840]  and how it affects your life, and then when the time comes
[35:23.840 --> 35:27.120]  and when the athletes are ready, it's your guys' job
[35:27.120 --> 35:29.280]  to endorse the right brands that are doing the right thing
[35:29.280 --> 35:32.240]  in this industry because there are so many bad actors,
[35:32.240 --> 35:33.960]  but there are lots of us with the right heart
[35:33.960 --> 35:35.640]  that really wanna get clean products
[35:35.640 --> 35:37.120]  into your family's hands.
[35:39.600 --> 35:42.800]  I think with the NFL, it'll take a little longer, though,
[35:42.800 --> 35:45.280]  because with them, it's more so the image of the league
[35:45.280 --> 35:46.940]  and the brand, just how you see it is
[35:46.940 --> 35:48.720]  with the Stanston National Anthem.
[35:48.720 --> 35:51.120]  As far as on the lower level, the coaches themselves,
[35:51.120 --> 35:52.680]  these are coaches I've had personally.
[35:52.680 --> 35:54.440]  They're just like, if you guys are gonna do it, go ahead.
[35:54.440 --> 35:55.960]  We know if you need it, you need it.
[35:55.960 --> 35:57.120]  We're aware of that.
[35:57.120 --> 35:59.000]  We got our tests, our annual tests, once a year,
[35:59.000 --> 36:01.880]  so it's either in the spring or it's in the training camp,
[36:01.880 --> 36:04.480]  and if you fail that, that's when you're in the program.
[36:04.480 --> 36:06.680]  So once you pass that test, you're good for the year.
[36:06.680 --> 36:08.800]  So they pretty much, they know, they're fully aware.
[36:09.800 --> 36:12.000]  They don't wanna be so blatant for it to damage the brand.
[36:12.000 --> 36:13.200]  It's all about the brand.
[36:13.200 --> 36:15.320]  So once it gets to a corporate level,
[36:15.320 --> 36:16.760]  like how it was in Canada, like with Canopy,
[36:16.760 --> 36:18.320]  with that level where the same guys,
[36:18.320 --> 36:20.640]  like Jerry Jones has money in the oil,
[36:20.640 --> 36:22.280]  he can put it in the marijuana,
[36:22.280 --> 36:23.280]  then they'll be all for it,
[36:23.280 --> 36:24.160]  because remember, at the end of the day,
[36:24.160 --> 36:25.960]  those guys, the owners, they're businessmen.
[36:25.960 --> 36:28.520]  So the business side of it is really opening their eyes,
[36:28.520 --> 36:30.160]  because a good friend of mine
[36:30.160 --> 36:33.040]  is actually a big corporate owner,
[36:33.040 --> 36:35.200]  and he's friends with a couple owners of the NFL,
[36:35.200 --> 36:36.800]  and they're kinda opening their eyes
[36:36.800 --> 36:37.920]  to the business opportunities of it.
[36:37.920 --> 36:39.680]  They actually put some money into the stocks in Canada,
[36:39.680 --> 36:40.520]  and things like that.
[36:40.520 --> 36:43.320]  So they're coming around, but I think the NBA
[36:43.320 --> 36:45.680]  is just always ahead of the NFL in terms of player,
[36:45.680 --> 36:46.880]  in terms of how they treat the players,
[36:46.880 --> 36:48.720]  and how to let the players express themselves,
[36:48.720 --> 36:51.720]  and the actual say, and that the players have.
[36:53.120 --> 36:55.520]  And baseball and hockey don't even care, do they?
[36:55.520 --> 37:00.520]  They'll just follow you guys' lead.
[37:01.320 --> 37:03.840]  So I wanna know, if you're tested once a year,
[37:03.840 --> 37:06.560]  and you get the call, you know you're clean,
[37:06.560 --> 37:09.960]  you go get tested, how high do you get right after that
[37:09.960 --> 37:11.760]  when you leave the testing facility?
[37:11.760 --> 37:15.440]  It depends on how long you had to wait.
[37:15.440 --> 37:20.040]  So if you had like in the spring, say it's April,
[37:20.040 --> 37:23.240]  you'd go to mini camp, mid-April, mid-June.
[37:23.240 --> 37:27.040]  So you stop in like March, so you have like,
[37:27.040 --> 37:28.200]  I don't know, I would usually give myself,
[37:28.200 --> 37:30.920]  I would cut it short, because I had my system down.
[37:30.920 --> 37:32.360]  I'd be like, all right, my body fat's here.
[37:32.360 --> 37:33.480]  I'd be like, I need this many days.
[37:33.480 --> 37:35.600]  I drink two gallons of water a day,
[37:35.600 --> 37:38.120]  do my regular workouts, I'll be good in 10 days.
[37:38.120 --> 37:39.760]  So like I would cut it closer than most guys,
[37:39.760 --> 37:43.120]  but a lot of people would do like 30, they would stop then.
[37:43.120 --> 37:44.280]  But I remember, like after that,
[37:44.280 --> 37:46.240]  everybody had their test, and everybody would like go,
[37:46.240 --> 37:47.480]  everybody would go link up together,
[37:47.480 --> 37:49.320]  and everybody just have a good big session.
[37:49.320 --> 37:50.160]  Yeah, yeah.
[37:50.160 --> 37:51.000]  And be like, oh, the test came.
[37:51.000 --> 37:51.840]  And it'd be like a whole seg,
[37:51.840 --> 37:52.760]  they do it by seg a lot of times.
[37:52.760 --> 37:54.360]  So like, it'll be the DBs.
[37:54.360 --> 37:56.480]  Sometimes it'd be like, oh, they do something,
[37:56.480 --> 37:57.360]  everybody thinks it's corny,
[37:57.360 --> 37:59.000]  because most of the times, the guys that don't smoke
[37:59.000 --> 38:01.280]  is the O-linemen, for the most part.
[38:01.280 --> 38:03.000]  So it'd be like, in the spring, the first test,
[38:03.000 --> 38:03.840]  like everybody would get mad,
[38:03.840 --> 38:05.120]  like, why you testing the O-linemen first?
[38:05.120 --> 38:06.800]  Like, you know they don't smoke anyway.
[38:06.800 --> 38:07.640]  So it's like.
[38:07.640 --> 38:09.440]  The linemen don't smoke.
[38:09.440 --> 38:11.280]  Yes, they do it by seg group and things like that.
[38:11.280 --> 38:12.920]  It kind of breaks down, everybody gets split up,
[38:12.920 --> 38:15.880]  everybody gets done in the spring and then in training camp.
[38:15.880 --> 38:16.840]  Kickers.
[38:16.840 --> 38:17.720]  Oh, and the kickers, yeah.
[38:17.720 --> 38:20.320]  So yeah, you need to get those, get them out the way.
[38:20.320 --> 38:21.160]  Yeah.
[38:21.160 --> 38:23.280]  So you need a ceremony for that.
[38:23.280 --> 38:24.920]  I would have a bowl loaded
[38:24.920 --> 38:27.120]  and just be ready to rock after that test.
[38:27.120 --> 38:28.680]  Yes, I know.
[38:28.680 --> 38:29.840]  No, interesting stuff.
[38:29.840 --> 38:32.800]  And so, you know, I think it is something important
[38:32.800 --> 38:33.960]  to say again, like, you know,
[38:33.960 --> 38:35.920]  all these guys have lived these lives
[38:35.920 --> 38:38.000]  and it had to wait until now.
[38:38.000 --> 38:41.160]  So I work, I want to quickly mention an organization,
[38:41.160 --> 38:43.840]  Sue's on the board, Al's part of it, Matt's part of it.
[38:43.840 --> 38:45.400]  You're going to be part of it soon, I hope,
[38:45.400 --> 38:46.520]  if you'll honor us.
[38:46.520 --> 38:48.440]  It's called Athletes for Care.
[38:48.440 --> 38:50.480]  We work with retired athletes,
[38:50.480 --> 38:52.800]  not only just to help them understand cannabis,
[38:52.800 --> 38:55.760]  but to help understand how to assimilate back into life
[38:55.760 --> 38:58.560]  after, you know, beyond the glory kind of thing.
[38:58.560 --> 38:59.720]  So when the lights go off
[38:59.720 --> 39:01.400]  and you're not a professional athlete anymore,
[39:01.400 --> 39:03.960]  it's not the most easy thing in the world,
[39:03.960 --> 39:05.760]  financially and a lot of other ways.
[39:05.760 --> 39:08.080]  And so beyond just teaching them cannabis
[39:08.080 --> 39:09.400]  as an alternative to opiates,
[39:09.400 --> 39:11.120]  we've got mentors and then people
[39:11.120 --> 39:12.280]  who are just out of the league.
[39:12.280 --> 39:14.040]  And, you know, one of the big things
[39:14.040 --> 39:16.040]  and pillars of that organization,
[39:16.040 --> 39:17.640]  and again, it's not just cannabis,
[39:17.640 --> 39:20.280]  but I want to mention that one of the pillars is cannabis
[39:20.280 --> 39:22.480]  to keep them level and keep them healthy.
[39:22.480 --> 39:26.240]  And it's a great organization you should check out.
[39:26.840 --> 39:31.840]  So as we end here, kind of as we wrap this into kind of Q&A,
[39:33.720 --> 39:38.240]  to me, what I've seen happen is a movement
[39:38.240 --> 39:41.200]  of a few guys doing this and then starting to talk,
[39:41.200 --> 39:43.000]  and then a few more ex guys talking,
[39:43.000 --> 39:46.760]  and then game for 20 games and other people starting things.
[39:46.760 --> 39:49.080]  There's a social movement out there
[39:49.080 --> 39:51.080]  and there's thousands and thousands of people
[39:51.080 --> 39:54.280]  that define themselves as athletes that use cannabis,
[39:54.320 --> 39:56.240]  canna athletes or whatever you want to call it.
[39:56.240 --> 39:58.040]  And they're, you know, that's what your product line
[39:58.040 --> 39:59.880]  is built for from what I can see, Al.
[39:59.880 --> 40:04.000]  And so it's just, I'm very, very thankful to these guys.
[40:04.000 --> 40:06.600]  So I want, before we wrap this up and go into a Q&A,
[40:06.600 --> 40:08.880]  let's give them a huge round of applause for being brave.
[40:08.880 --> 40:11.120]  And they're the front lines of this movement.
[40:11.120 --> 40:13.760]  It's these guys that are going to help us legalize it.
[40:16.040 --> 40:17.800]  Really is these guys that are going to help move it
[40:17.800 --> 40:18.720]  across the line.
[40:19.920 --> 40:22.160]  So, you know, from here, I guess,
[40:22.160 --> 40:24.840]  why don't we jump into a little bit of a Q&A?
[40:26.240 --> 40:27.080]  You got a mic?
[40:27.080 --> 40:28.640]  All right.
[40:28.640 --> 40:30.280]  This question's for Jim.
[40:30.280 --> 40:35.240]  You mentioned the power plant fitness center.
[40:35.240 --> 40:38.880]  What's the state, the current state of onsite consumption
[40:38.880 --> 40:40.000]  in the regulations now?
[40:40.000 --> 40:41.600]  And when do you think that will be possible
[40:41.600 --> 40:44.320]  that you will be able to open a gym
[40:44.320 --> 40:47.120]  that you can consume onsite?
[40:47.120 --> 40:50.120]  I mean, legally it's possible now.
[40:50.120 --> 40:51.720]  I mean, there's ways to do it in a,
[40:51.720 --> 40:53.280]  call it a cigar room style
[40:53.280 --> 40:54.960]  where it's separated and ventilated.
[40:54.960 --> 40:56.480]  So, I mean, we were legally able
[40:56.480 --> 40:58.200]  to potentially do what we did.
[40:58.200 --> 41:00.280]  We were unable to open the gym
[41:00.280 --> 41:02.600]  due to some regulatory stuff outside of that.
[41:02.600 --> 41:03.840]  And then the inability to raise,
[41:03.840 --> 41:06.320]  we had a pretty large capital raise that,
[41:06.320 --> 41:08.120]  it was right when Trump and Sessions kind of came
[41:08.120 --> 41:09.960]  into office, which kind of killed our raise
[41:09.960 --> 41:12.200]  from some more traditional VCs
[41:12.200 --> 41:13.600]  that were going to get into the game.
[41:13.600 --> 41:15.440]  But, you know, legally it's,
[41:15.440 --> 41:17.400]  there's a lot of things you got to jump through,
[41:17.400 --> 41:20.080]  but there's ways to do it now if you wanted to do that.
[41:20.920 --> 41:23.400]  If you want to open a cannabis gym, give me a call.
[41:23.400 --> 41:25.000]  I'm still trying to do it.
[41:25.000 --> 41:26.760]  Ice hockey rink.
[41:26.760 --> 41:28.800]  Awesome, smoking ice hockey rink.
[41:28.800 --> 41:29.640]  I love that.
[41:30.640 --> 41:32.760]  So this question is for Nick.
[41:32.760 --> 41:34.480]  So you mentioned that during training camp
[41:34.480 --> 41:39.040]  and over the summer you stay clean unless you're tested.
[41:39.040 --> 41:41.560]  Did you notice that recovery time from being hit
[41:41.560 --> 41:45.000]  or having some of the concussion-like symptoms
[41:45.000 --> 41:50.000]  was more or less after using cannabis and CBD?
[41:50.160 --> 41:51.960]  See, I didn't have too much head trauma.
[41:51.960 --> 41:53.200]  So as far as the off season,
[41:53.200 --> 41:54.800]  when I had to actually stop smoking,
[41:54.800 --> 41:56.520]  I felt more of the effects of my training,
[41:56.520 --> 41:58.640]  like as far as my recovery and my rest.
[41:58.640 --> 42:00.720]  That's when I felt like,
[42:00.720 --> 42:03.520]  me, I personally, I like smoke on my way to working out.
[42:03.520 --> 42:06.680]  Like I'll smoke like right before I get there.
[42:06.680 --> 42:08.880]  And that's kind of gets me in my right mental state.
[42:08.880 --> 42:10.800]  And like, I actually feel like I breathe better when I do.
[42:10.800 --> 42:12.600]  I know it sounds weird, but like when I don't smoke,
[42:12.600 --> 42:14.320]  I feel like I can't breathe.
[42:14.320 --> 42:15.600]  Yeah, I get that too.
[42:15.600 --> 42:16.440]  I've asked that.
[42:16.760 --> 42:18.080]  I had a question.
[42:18.080 --> 42:20.320]  Given the fact that the professional organizations
[42:20.320 --> 42:21.600]  are not accepting of use,
[42:21.600 --> 42:24.120]  how do athletes, current athletes,
[42:24.120 --> 42:29.120]  get educated on the various effects of cannabis
[42:29.280 --> 42:30.200]  and what it can do for them?
[42:30.200 --> 42:32.160]  Is it more just like athletes
[42:32.160 --> 42:34.320]  sharing their personal stories in the locker room?
[42:34.320 --> 42:39.320]  Or how did each of you start your journey
[42:39.360 --> 42:43.360]  into researching the effects and what it might do for you?
[42:43.480 --> 42:46.440]  I guess kind of once I actually got into the program,
[42:46.440 --> 42:47.920]  I looked into it more deeply,
[42:47.920 --> 42:49.840]  as far as like once they started making me
[42:49.840 --> 42:51.520]  like listen to them explain all the chemicals
[42:51.520 --> 42:52.720]  and stuff like that.
[42:52.720 --> 42:54.280]  Then I kind of understood like how it would actually
[42:54.280 --> 42:56.000]  like help me when I looked at it
[42:56.000 --> 42:58.040]  from the scientific perspective.
[42:58.040 --> 42:58.880]  But like,
[43:02.360 --> 43:03.200]  hold on a second.
[43:04.800 --> 43:06.760]  I mean, that's a hard one right there actually.
[43:06.760 --> 43:09.040]  It's kind of, you got anything for that Al?
[43:09.160 --> 43:10.240]  I mean, I'm not an athlete,
[43:10.240 --> 43:17.440]  but I can still tag in on how I learned,
[43:17.440 --> 43:19.440]  which is, I mean,
[43:19.440 --> 43:21.400]  probably by doing the wrong things sometimes,
[43:21.400 --> 43:22.720]  like smoking too much.
[43:22.720 --> 43:25.000]  And then coming back from that,
[43:25.000 --> 43:26.800]  I mean, I'm sure that has to be something
[43:26.800 --> 43:28.400]  that a lot of people still do.
[43:28.400 --> 43:30.800]  There wasn't the wealth of information available
[43:30.800 --> 43:32.920]  that there is like now.
[43:32.920 --> 43:36.000]  And that there has been in the last two or three years
[43:36.000 --> 43:36.840]  on the internet.
[43:36.840 --> 43:38.000]  And so I think it's like,
[43:38.000 --> 43:39.440]  I think it's a lot of people are like,
[43:39.440 --> 43:40.760]  well, I'm not gonna do this.
[43:40.760 --> 43:42.640]  But I think it's been in the last two or three years,
[43:42.640 --> 43:43.480]  honestly.
[43:43.480 --> 43:46.520]  I mean, the market has changed so much
[43:46.520 --> 43:49.000]  and the conversation has really shifted.
[43:49.000 --> 43:50.760]  But I mean, to start, at least myself,
[43:50.760 --> 43:53.640]  I mean, I remember smoking my first bowl
[43:53.640 --> 43:55.640]  and I was like, well, okay, this is interesting.
[43:55.640 --> 43:57.360]  And then somebody would give me a different,
[43:57.360 --> 43:58.240]  you know, some purple.
[43:58.240 --> 43:59.760]  And I was like, oh, this is way,
[43:59.760 --> 44:01.560]  this is not what I just smoked last week.
[44:01.560 --> 44:03.880]  And that's, it's trial and error.
[44:03.880 --> 44:06.280]  And then hopefully learning from your mistakes
[44:06.280 --> 44:08.760]  and also sharing the information with your friends.
[44:08.760 --> 44:13.240]  In general, education is probably one of the biggest issues
[44:13.240 --> 44:14.640]  in the industry anywhere.
[44:14.640 --> 44:17.360]  And not just for consumers on the street,
[44:17.360 --> 44:20.240]  even major politicians don't know what is going on.
[44:20.240 --> 44:24.440]  So I think in general, that information is critical.
[44:24.440 --> 44:26.440]  And we've invested in some companies recently.
[44:26.440 --> 44:30.120]  There's the WebMD of cannabis we think is really good.
[44:30.120 --> 44:32.640]  So I think there's more information tools to come.
[44:32.640 --> 44:36.440]  But just understanding what is happening
[44:36.440 --> 44:39.240]  is probably the most important answer we can give you.
[44:39.240 --> 44:42.040]  I mean, for example, we invest in a lot of insurance companies.
[44:42.040 --> 44:45.600]  I don't know, does anyone have life insurance here?
[44:45.600 --> 44:48.680]  Okay, has anyone tried to get life insurance
[44:48.680 --> 44:52.280]  while you're smoking cannabis and get tested for it?
[44:52.280 --> 44:55.800]  Right, I mean, it used to be life insurance,
[44:55.800 --> 44:58.400]  you would get denied if they found cannabis in your system
[44:58.400 --> 45:00.400]  and in every other way you were healthy, right?
[45:00.400 --> 45:01.920]  Which is absurd.
[45:01.920 --> 45:05.800]  Now, they penalize you basically
[45:05.800 --> 45:08.200]  somewhere between if you're a tobacco user
[45:08.200 --> 45:12.600]  or an extreme alcohol user, but they'll give it to you.
[45:12.600 --> 45:15.400]  And you think about these insurance companies,
[45:15.400 --> 45:18.120]  the resources they have, and to not be educated enough
[45:18.120 --> 45:21.240]  to know that you're telling me I can't get insurance
[45:21.240 --> 45:25.600]  because if I don't even consume alcohol or tobacco
[45:25.600 --> 45:30.440]  or opioids, but I use a natural product to sleep or my pain,
[45:30.440 --> 45:32.640]  that you're gonna penalize me on my life insurance
[45:32.640 --> 45:34.480]  to take care of my family?
[45:34.480 --> 45:36.240]  I mean, there's things that are just crazy.
[45:36.240 --> 45:38.400]  They're getting better, they're starting to get smarter,
[45:38.400 --> 45:39.880]  but it's an institutional thing.
[45:39.880 --> 45:41.920]  And as far as she said, as far as the trial and error,
[45:41.920 --> 45:43.080]  I think that's definitely a big one.
[45:43.080 --> 45:46.320]  As far as myself, I kind of learned that edibles
[45:46.320 --> 45:47.960]  are another good way I like to kind of medicate
[45:47.960 --> 45:50.000]  before physical activity, like playing the game,
[45:50.000 --> 45:52.280]  because I know it would last longer.
[45:52.280 --> 45:53.560]  So I could be the edible for the game,
[45:53.560 --> 45:54.480]  it would last me the whole game.
[45:54.480 --> 45:56.400]  Or if I just smoked a blunt, it would only kind of last me
[45:56.400 --> 45:57.960]  kind of like through the first quarter.
[45:57.960 --> 46:00.120]  And then you kind of learn from the older guys too,
[46:00.120 --> 46:01.680]  like when you're first coming in,
[46:01.680 --> 46:02.640]  you're like, kind of like, all right, like,
[46:02.640 --> 46:03.480]  how do I do this?
[46:03.920 --> 46:06.120]  How do I make sure I can get high before the game
[46:06.120 --> 46:09.000]  and I don't get caught and I can make sure
[46:09.000 --> 46:09.960]  I get my stuff with me?
[46:09.960 --> 46:11.520]  So you kind of learn from other guys,
[46:11.520 --> 46:13.160]  they teach you how to go about it.
[46:13.160 --> 46:14.880]  And as far as they actually learning
[46:14.880 --> 46:16.120]  what the plant does to you,
[46:16.120 --> 46:18.440]  now it's getting to the point now
[46:18.440 --> 46:19.440]  where more guys are open to it.
[46:19.440 --> 46:21.000]  So now it's like, I've always been known
[46:21.000 --> 46:23.800]  to the younger guys in college and guys I played with,
[46:23.800 --> 46:24.640]  I was always a smoker.
[46:24.640 --> 46:27.840]  So guys that didn't smoke or didn't smoke as much,
[46:27.840 --> 46:29.560]  they're looking to, they're hearing more
[46:29.560 --> 46:31.160]  of the medical benefits and they want to know more.
[46:31.160 --> 46:33.400]  So they want to talk to somebody else that actually does it.
[46:34.240 --> 46:35.080]  I get more people coming to me face to face,
[46:35.080 --> 46:36.680]  especially training in Miami where I train at
[46:36.680 --> 46:38.640]  and with my trainer, Bob Rito,
[46:38.640 --> 46:40.160]  and then my doctors I go to that do like
[46:40.160 --> 46:42.000]  the stem cell therapy and the prolo
[46:42.000 --> 46:44.360]  and the nutrient IVs.
[46:44.360 --> 46:46.480]  So it's kind of everybody else all at the same time
[46:46.480 --> 46:47.760]  is trying to gain interest in it.
[46:47.760 --> 46:49.840]  So at the same time, athletes are learning
[46:49.840 --> 46:51.480]  about it more than medical professionals
[46:51.480 --> 46:54.480]  that look into, not the traditional methods of healing,
[46:54.480 --> 46:56.040]  like the surgeries and the injections,
[46:56.040 --> 46:57.480]  but more of the homeopathic.
[46:58.520 --> 47:01.000]  They're kind of helping us educate as well too,
[47:01.000 --> 47:02.960]  because they're learning at the same time.
[47:04.400 --> 47:07.080]  I guess this question is more for Eliza.
[47:07.080 --> 47:10.840]  It's really cool to hear your guys' experiences
[47:10.840 --> 47:14.040]  on the professional field,
[47:14.040 --> 47:16.200]  but I'm not an NFL player.
[47:16.200 --> 47:17.760]  I don't know if you could tell.
[47:19.040 --> 47:20.520]  So I was hoping to hear a little bit more
[47:20.520 --> 47:23.560]  about how you suggest we incorporate cannabis
[47:23.560 --> 47:26.120]  into normal people fitness.
[47:26.120 --> 47:27.800]  Totally, yeah.
[47:27.800 --> 47:29.120]  Well, so we did ask the question
[47:29.120 --> 47:31.520]  who consumes cannabis before a workout.
[47:31.520 --> 47:33.000]  Can I just see a show of hands
[47:33.600 --> 47:34.920]  who uses it after?
[47:36.720 --> 47:39.280]  Okay, a little bit more than the before.
[47:39.280 --> 47:40.200]  So that's awesome.
[47:40.200 --> 47:43.080]  So there are three ways to use cannabis, right?
[47:43.080 --> 47:45.880]  So you can consume it, you can inhale it,
[47:45.880 --> 47:47.280]  or you can apply it.
[47:47.280 --> 47:49.000]  So topicals, in other words.
[47:49.000 --> 47:51.280]  So the first thing is just educating people
[47:51.280 --> 47:53.880]  about those three different modes of application
[47:53.880 --> 47:56.960]  and understanding how they can be used.
[47:56.960 --> 47:58.800]  It really depends on the activity.
[47:58.800 --> 48:00.880]  There are certain activities that I personally
[48:00.880 --> 48:02.960]  wouldn't recommend using cannabis,
[48:03.800 --> 48:06.520]  beforehand because of just, you know,
[48:06.520 --> 48:07.760]  sometimes things are dangerous.
[48:07.760 --> 48:10.800]  So certain people, when they're lifting super,
[48:10.800 --> 48:11.680]  you know, weights and stuff,
[48:11.680 --> 48:13.400]  I wouldn't recommend high THC
[48:13.400 --> 48:15.920]  because your muscles do get a little bit more relaxed
[48:15.920 --> 48:18.720]  and somebody, I've got somebody laughing over here
[48:18.720 --> 48:21.760]  because obviously he's done it once or twice.
[48:21.760 --> 48:25.400]  But so that's one thing to be aware of.
[48:25.400 --> 48:27.040]  But once again, educating yourself
[48:27.040 --> 48:28.440]  and learning about these products,
[48:28.440 --> 48:30.760]  starting with micro doses.
[48:30.760 --> 48:32.520]  This is something that I teach in my classes
[48:33.040 --> 48:34.120]  all of the time.
[48:34.120 --> 48:36.200]  Micro dosing, which means that you're using
[48:36.200 --> 48:37.280]  less than a medicinal dose.
[48:37.280 --> 48:40.520]  So start with two to three to five milligrams
[48:40.520 --> 48:42.160]  and then work your way up from there.
[48:42.160 --> 48:44.240]  Really give your body and yourself a chance
[48:44.240 --> 48:48.720]  to understand how your body interacts with this medicine.
[48:48.720 --> 48:52.040]  And also just understanding that you want to find
[48:52.040 --> 48:55.640]  the least amount necessary to get the desired effect,
[48:55.640 --> 48:58.720]  which is something we don't really see very often
[48:58.720 --> 49:00.080]  in the pharmaceutical industry.
[49:00.080 --> 49:00.920]  It's like, they're like,
[49:00.920 --> 49:02.640]  we want to make sure we eradicate that.
[49:02.640 --> 49:04.920]  So we're going to give you three times the normal dose
[49:04.920 --> 49:07.080]  to make sure that you don't need to come back.
[49:07.080 --> 49:08.040]  No, no, no, no.
[49:08.040 --> 49:09.520]  We want to start with, once again,
[49:09.520 --> 49:12.640]  the least amount necessary for that desired effect.
[49:12.640 --> 49:16.640]  You want to allow yourself to find space
[49:16.640 --> 49:19.280]  and to really find that time to focus.
[49:19.280 --> 49:20.480]  With yoga classes,
[49:21.400 --> 49:23.600]  weight is awesome before a good yoga practice
[49:23.600 --> 49:26.120]  or meditation even, and really getting into your body
[49:26.120 --> 49:28.680]  because when people are on their mats in my classes,
[49:28.680 --> 49:30.280]  it's called bend and blaze.
[49:30.600 --> 49:32.800]  People, they think that they need to get blazed.
[49:32.800 --> 49:34.920]  And when I say, no, I want you to get lifted.
[49:34.920 --> 49:36.480]  I don't want you to get high.
[49:36.480 --> 49:39.120]  There's a big difference between high and lifted.
[49:39.120 --> 49:41.000]  And I want you to find that in-between space
[49:41.000 --> 49:44.600]  where you feel enlightened as opposed to feeling stoned
[49:44.600 --> 49:46.160]  and like you need to lie down.
[49:46.160 --> 49:48.440]  So there's a few different ways to apply it.
[49:48.440 --> 49:49.680]  I don't know if I answered your question,
[49:49.680 --> 49:52.240]  but I think it's important to talk about it.
[49:52.240 --> 49:54.680]  And for anybody who's interested in applying cannabis
[49:54.680 --> 49:57.400]  to their practice or day-to-day activity,
[49:57.400 --> 49:58.420]  please find me later.
[49:58.420 --> 50:00.260]  I'd love to talk to you about what you're doing
[50:00.260 --> 50:03.700]  and how we can enhance it and also solve any issues
[50:03.700 --> 50:05.620]  that you may have in your day-to-day.
[50:05.620 --> 50:06.700]  I like lifted.
[50:06.700 --> 50:09.340]  I call it activated is kind of our term for it.
[50:10.820 --> 50:13.220]  So as we close up,
[50:13.220 --> 50:15.460]  there's something I kind of like to close up on
[50:15.460 --> 50:17.980]  and I like to bring cannabis into a bigger picture
[50:17.980 --> 50:20.060]  and a bigger discussion and not just talk about it
[50:20.060 --> 50:21.620]  as like to get high.
[50:21.620 --> 50:23.180]  Cannabis is part of our lives,
[50:23.180 --> 50:24.700]  whether you're an athlete or not,
[50:24.700 --> 50:26.560]  to be well and to be happy.
[50:27.400 --> 50:29.680]  I started this off by saying,
[50:29.680 --> 50:32.480]  marijuana used to be a drug and it was bad,
[50:32.480 --> 50:34.760]  but really it's a medicine.
[50:34.760 --> 50:37.640]  Cannabis is a medicine that makes us better people.
[50:37.640 --> 50:40.480]  And we should look at not only cannabis,
[50:40.480 --> 50:42.880]  cannabis is a plant, everything we put in our body.
[50:42.880 --> 50:47.880]  So food is medicine and America looks at medicine
[50:47.880 --> 50:51.040]  as what I think of as a drug, which is a white pill.
[50:51.040 --> 50:55.680]  And medicine and a pill or excuse me, drugs or a pill,
[50:55.680 --> 50:58.080]  that's trying to fix something that was bad decisions
[50:58.080 --> 50:59.440]  made over a lot of years.
[50:59.440 --> 51:01.920]  And I think that if we can use cannabis
[51:01.920 --> 51:04.480]  in a lifestyle of wellness, eating right,
[51:04.480 --> 51:06.700]  thinking about what we put into our body,
[51:06.700 --> 51:09.120]  what kind of cannabis we use, when we use it,
[51:09.120 --> 51:10.380]  how we use it.
[51:10.380 --> 51:13.400]  I just want everybody to think about mindful cannabis use,
[51:13.400 --> 51:14.640]  especially as an athlete,
[51:14.640 --> 51:15.840]  because if you're gonna use cannabis
[51:15.840 --> 51:16.920]  and you're gonna go out
[51:16.920 --> 51:19.800]  and you're gonna go surf in a big wave or do whatever,
[51:19.800 --> 51:22.240]  you wanna be on your game and you don't wanna get hurt.
[51:22.240 --> 51:23.120]  And same thing in life.
[51:23.120 --> 51:25.060]  So be mindful with your cannabis use,
[51:25.500 --> 51:26.340]  find out what works for you.
[51:26.340 --> 51:28.220]  It's not the same for everybody.
[51:28.220 --> 51:29.060]  God bless you all.
[51:29.060 --> 51:31.060]  Let's give these guys a big round of applause.
[51:31.060 --> 51:31.900]  Thanks.
