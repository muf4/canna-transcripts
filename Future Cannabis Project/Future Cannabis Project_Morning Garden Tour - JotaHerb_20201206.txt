[00:01.400 --> 00:09.000]  All right, welcome everyone. We're live for our morning garden tour and with us
[00:09.000 --> 00:15.600]  from Worcester, Mass is this man. How are you? I'm doing fantastic. Thank you so
[00:15.600 --> 00:19.520]  much for having me. I'm really excited to be here today. No problem.
[00:19.520 --> 00:24.880]  We were just talking because I grew up in Boston too, or
[00:24.880 --> 00:30.160]  Massachusetts, and in high school I used to go to Allman Brothers concerts and
[00:30.160 --> 00:34.480]  other concerts out in Worcester. And then you were talking about how Worcester,
[00:34.480 --> 00:40.720]  did you say it has been or currently is? It has been. It has been the center of
[00:40.720 --> 00:44.680]  the cannabis universe for Massachusetts. This is really where the cannabis
[00:44.680 --> 00:51.040]  community itself has established itself the most. This is where we have one
[00:51.040 --> 00:54.280]  of our prime community events, the Harvest Cup, that happens every year,
[00:54.280 --> 00:58.800]  which is really one of the best industry events that I've been to, at least on the
[00:58.800 --> 01:03.560]  East Coast. And it's also where the Cannabis Control Commission for
[01:03.560 --> 01:07.720]  Massachusetts is. It's where there's more licensing and grows that have been
[01:07.720 --> 01:11.920]  approved than anywhere else in the state. So Worcester, the center, Worcester is
[01:11.920 --> 01:17.760]  kind of that center. It's also one of the areas that was supposed to be helped by
[01:17.760 --> 01:24.240]  this change, where these communities that have been impacted by the
[01:24.240 --> 01:29.040]  war on drugs, like Springfield and like Worcester and some of these other
[01:29.040 --> 01:33.400]  old milk communities, they were supposed to be the ones that were supposed to be
[01:33.400 --> 01:37.280]  helped by a lot of this stuff. So that's actually where a lot of the licensing
[01:37.280 --> 01:44.640]  has happened. You know, we had Snoop Dogg come to Uxbridge a couple of months ago.
[01:44.640 --> 01:49.880]  He went to go visit Caroline's Cannabis in Uxbridge, Mass., which is an awesome
[01:50.000 --> 01:58.920]  small woman-owned business. Her husband was impacted by the war on drugs. And,
[01:58.920 --> 02:03.240]  you know, they're a small local-owned business. They buy from a couple of the
[02:03.240 --> 02:08.880]  local grows and great, great local company. And Snoop Dogg actually came by
[02:08.880 --> 02:14.240]  and visited them. I think it was like last October, maybe, maybe last February.
[02:14.240 --> 02:17.040]  It was before all the COVID funds started happening.
[02:17.480 --> 02:24.480]  That's funny. So, well, tell me, let's do a history lesson. So kind of, you know,
[02:24.480 --> 02:29.160]  what the weed scene was like in the... Because for me, you know, I graduated high
[02:29.160 --> 02:37.440]  school in 94. And it wasn't until college that I saw anything besides brickweed. So
[02:37.440 --> 02:42.640]  that would be like 95. And then I started, you know, actually my friend from Boston,
[02:42.640 --> 02:49.200]  he went to Williams, I went to Brown. And we used to meet up in Cambridge to buy in
[02:49.200 --> 02:55.760]  bulk from this guy, Ron, who went to Berkeley School of Music. And then I'd go
[02:55.760 --> 03:01.360]  back to Providence, he'd go out to Western Mass, and we'd both sell to our
[03:01.360 --> 03:03.280]  respective universities.
[03:03.280 --> 03:07.840]  I'm surprised you weren't getting more stuff out of the Amherst area. That always,
[03:07.840 --> 03:08.040]  to me...
[03:08.760 --> 03:15.880]  Well, that's why I want to hear more about it. And he blew right past Worcester and
[03:15.880 --> 03:17.600]  that area to come to Boston.
[03:17.600 --> 03:28.040]  Yeah. So I actually spent a good amount of my adult life in Florida before coming to
[03:28.040 --> 03:33.160]  Massachusetts in 2000 during the dot-com boom. So I actually mentioned this before,
[03:33.160 --> 03:38.840]  I am an IT guy. I'm a data warehousing and data engineering person by trade. And I
[03:38.840 --> 03:46.480]  started my cannabis career kind of in Tampa, really. I started growing back in 1989,
[03:46.480 --> 03:52.080]  1990, in that time range with some seeds that were smuggled back over from
[03:52.080 --> 03:58.240]  Amsterdam. And I did some small hydroponics in my closet, in my bedroom. And
[03:58.720 --> 04:04.240]  that's where I actually got started with growing. But I came to Massachusetts in 2001.
[04:04.240 --> 04:11.680]  And it was really... You were getting a lot of beasters out of Canada, right? That's what
[04:11.680 --> 04:17.760]  they called them, beasters. It was that BC bud that would come down from Canada. You could get
[04:17.760 --> 04:24.000]  some homegrown and some good stuff coming out of Vermont and New Hampshire sometimes,
[04:24.000 --> 04:32.160]  definitely out of the Amherst area in the early 2000s. But the scene itself was, again,
[04:32.160 --> 04:38.320]  it was very much limited. They were still, if you went to the Boston Freedom Rally, for instance,
[04:38.320 --> 04:43.760]  they were still arresting people in the early 2000s at the Boston Freedom Rally for smoking
[04:43.760 --> 04:53.040]  weed in public. But then you fast forward a couple of years to legalization. And because they did it
[04:53.120 --> 05:00.560]  right in Massachusetts by allowing home grow, it allowed this incredible scene to develop over the
[05:00.560 --> 05:11.520]  last few years. So basically since 2017, people have been really actually focused on home grow
[05:11.520 --> 05:18.720]  so much more, I think, than the big commercial cultivations, because it took until 2019 to
[05:18.720 --> 05:24.800]  really even get a legal cannabis store open. So if you were going to start getting some really
[05:24.800 --> 05:32.000]  good cannabis, you had to grow it. And so that, because Massachusetts allowed you to grow six
[05:32.000 --> 05:39.920]  plants per person, 12 per household, that completely opened up the floodgates. So I set
[05:39.920 --> 05:46.080]  back up, lots of people started setting back up, and we all started finding each other,
[05:46.960 --> 05:55.120]  going to Canicon and NECAN and eventually the Harvest Cup, which kicked off. It started people
[05:56.000 --> 06:02.400]  being willing to come out of the closet. And I think that's the part that most people
[06:03.360 --> 06:08.880]  underestimate about how big the industry actually is or how many people actually grow.
[06:09.520 --> 06:15.680]  There's so many people underground, even in legal states. I'd say maybe 10% of the people
[06:15.840 --> 06:18.640]  who grow cannabis are actually showing their pictures online.
[06:20.000 --> 06:27.760]  Right. We got some fans and some East Coasters in the house today. I was going to try to bring,
[06:28.800 --> 06:35.120]  I wanted to bring some other massholes on. So I was actually about to look some people up.
[06:36.160 --> 06:43.360]  So can you talk about, I mean, I think two things, evolution, Florida in the 80s and into the,
[06:43.360 --> 06:46.480]  because you were in Florida, what, until 2000 when you moved to?
[06:46.480 --> 06:48.960]  Until 2000, yeah, until 2001.
[06:48.960 --> 06:53.840]  So kind of what was the evolution of, I mean, you said you smuggled in some stuff from Amsterdam,
[06:53.840 --> 06:57.040]  but what else were you seeing in the, did you say Tampa or where were you in Florida?
[06:57.040 --> 07:04.160]  Yeah, Tampa, Florida. So I was in Tampa, Florida from 88 through 2000. I'm originally from New York.
[07:04.160 --> 07:10.320]  So growing up in New York in Westchester County, which is about 45 minutes north of New York City,
[07:11.280 --> 07:17.840]  we used to go into the city to buy weed or we used to go to the Bronx to buy weed. So if you
[07:17.840 --> 07:23.600]  want to go far enough back, we used to call, we had a business card that this guy gave us,
[07:23.600 --> 07:31.200]  which was his pager. We would call the pager and he would be like, okay, go to this pay phone,
[07:31.200 --> 07:35.840]  call me from there and I'll meet you on this corner. We would go pick the guy up. He would
[07:35.840 --> 07:41.760]  jump in our car, do some business while we drove down the block, let him out and then get back on
[07:41.760 --> 07:49.120]  the Sawmill River Parkway and get back up to Westchester where I was. Or you'd go into the
[07:49.120 --> 07:54.240]  village and there was people walking around, all the Rastas were selling it in Washington Square
[07:54.240 --> 07:59.280]  Park. He'd get it in Central Park. It used to be everywhere. But when I went to Florida,
[08:00.160 --> 08:05.680]  that's where brick weed, I got first really introduced to brick weed. Florida is like,
[08:07.120 --> 08:09.440]  Florida, it's- Was it love at first sight?
[08:09.440 --> 08:16.880]  Oh yeah. So much love for, I will say that it was nice. It was probably the cheapest weed
[08:16.880 --> 08:23.680]  I had experienced. Coming from New York, the cannabis was more expensive. And so in Florida,
[08:23.680 --> 08:33.280]  it was really cheap to get brick weed. And some of it was okay. Some of it was probably
[08:33.280 --> 08:37.920]  really, really disgusting. When I look back at some of the things that I was willing to smoke
[08:37.920 --> 08:43.520]  back in the day, just because it was the only thing we can get our hands on, I'm pretty ashamed.
[08:43.520 --> 08:49.760]  I'm surprised I'm still alive and didn't get sick from it in certain cases. But yeah, that's where
[08:49.760 --> 08:56.800]  I got introduced to brick weed. And basically the colleges at, I was at University of Tampa
[08:56.800 --> 09:00.880]  and we were by University of South Florida, which is actually the largest state school
[09:00.880 --> 09:08.720]  in Florida, in Tampa. There was just tons of drugs in general. The Grateful Dead scene at the time
[09:08.720 --> 09:16.400]  was still very, very much alive and pretty open. I went to a show in Miami, I think it was in
[09:16.400 --> 09:21.200]  88 or 89. And there was people walking around with pictures and being like,
[09:21.840 --> 09:27.360]  all right, $50 headies, $50 headies with big pictures of beautiful buds at an ed show.
[09:28.560 --> 09:37.920]  Crazy, crazy sheets, sheets. So late 80s was a wild drug scene. And I think being in Tampa at
[09:37.920 --> 09:44.640]  that time was awesome because there was tons of stuff coming in that was brick weed. So there
[09:44.640 --> 09:50.400]  was tons of cheap available weed, but because of my connections and all my friends connections
[09:50.400 --> 09:56.480]  within the Grateful Dead scene, we had a lot of homegrown and fresh stuff coming in from Tennessee
[09:57.440 --> 10:03.120]  and Kentucky. We used to get those harvests. Occasionally we would get some Humboldt stuff
[10:03.120 --> 10:10.400]  that would come out. But most of it was Florida indoor hydro grown if you wanted the high end
[10:10.400 --> 10:17.280]  weed. And I think back in the day, it was like $25 or $35 a quarter for brick weed, but it was
[10:17.280 --> 10:24.480]  like $50 a quarter for headies as much as $75 a quarter ounce for headies we used to pay, I think
[10:24.480 --> 10:32.640]  in the early 90s, late 80s, early 90s. So prices really haven't changed all that much. If not,
[10:33.360 --> 10:38.960]  they are even at a store a little bit more expensive when you add the taxes on it.
[10:38.960 --> 10:46.080]  Yeah. And I feel like $50 an eighth in New England was always, for decades,
[10:48.640 --> 10:50.720]  it's interesting that the price kind of stays.
[10:53.120 --> 10:59.920]  Yeah. New York and New England were always much higher. So if you bought that quarter for $50
[10:59.920 --> 11:07.440]  in Florida, that was a $70 or $75 quarter up in New England or in New York. Prices were always
[11:07.440 --> 11:12.800]  more expensive. Prices by a quarter pound and a pound were much more expensive up in the Northeast.
[11:13.840 --> 11:20.720]  So what were in Florida, when you got the good indoor stuff, what were some of the flavors that
[11:20.720 --> 11:26.160]  were floating around? And then I'm interested in the Tennessee stuff.
[11:28.720 --> 11:30.240]  A lot of the time we never got names.
[11:31.920 --> 11:34.080]  But do you remember flavor, smell?
[11:34.080 --> 11:44.480]  Flavors and smells. So we grew SK1 by SK1 and SK1 by NL5, original seed stock from Amsterdam.
[11:44.480 --> 11:50.800]  We had the stuff was so stinky, it could peel the paint. You could smell it outside the apartment
[11:50.800 --> 11:56.400]  building. That's why so many people got busted was just because the stuff, it was so hard to
[11:56.400 --> 12:03.360]  grow it and control the odor. So we had lots of really, really stinky stuff we were growing
[12:03.360 --> 12:08.240]  ourselves. The stuff we were, for the most part, we had three primary sets of stuff we were growing.
[12:08.240 --> 12:13.440]  It was either really skunky, it was hash plant. We had a really good hash plant strain that we
[12:13.440 --> 12:20.000]  were growing for a while, but that was really dense, short, low yield. So it wasn't as prevalent.
[12:20.640 --> 12:26.480]  And we also had an awesome strain for a while called goofy grape, which I did some checking
[12:26.480 --> 12:34.400]  and looking at some of the history, which was actually a, was a Williams Wonder and cross with
[12:35.360 --> 12:40.880]  something else. It was Soma had actually was part of that original cross. Those are the main things
[12:40.880 --> 12:48.960]  that we had. We had a lot of lemony, fruity, citrusy buds that we were getting. I think that,
[12:48.960 --> 12:54.640]  if I remember correctly, that Tennessee stuff was definitely in the fruitier range.
[12:56.560 --> 13:05.600]  More sweet, a little bit more, definitely less dank and less skunky because it had to be
[13:05.600 --> 13:11.200]  transported. I think that was also part of it. The stuff that got transported was never the really
[13:11.200 --> 13:16.560]  stinky, heavy stuff. Right. For obvious reasons. Yep. Yep.
[13:17.440 --> 13:25.520]  And then in terms of you growing, I'm hearing a lot of like, were you doing hydro back then?
[13:25.520 --> 13:29.600]  Yeah, I started out doing hydro. And so I started with flood tables, Ebb and Flow
[13:30.400 --> 13:36.240]  is what we called it back in the day. And we went to Worms Way, which was one of the only
[13:36.240 --> 13:42.000]  growth stores in the nation. They had a couple of outlets. Worms Way also became famous because
[13:42.080 --> 13:47.120]  that's where the feds used to track and follow people home so they could bust them. So if you
[13:47.120 --> 13:51.680]  went to Worms Way to buy something, you couldn't take your own car. You had to take somebody else's
[13:51.680 --> 13:56.560]  car or you had to take a rental or do something else because they would actually take pictures
[13:56.560 --> 14:02.320]  of your license plate, follow you, monitor you, and then eventually bust you. Florida is crazy
[14:02.320 --> 14:08.480]  with the amount of law enforcement down there. So I started out with Ebb and Flow tubs. I used
[14:08.640 --> 14:13.920]  actually pickle buckets because I was working in a deli with cement mixing tubs that I cut holes
[14:13.920 --> 14:21.520]  into. And I bought a fountain pump at the time. And I went to Worms Way to buy the light because
[14:21.520 --> 14:25.200]  that was really the only place you could get a good light unless you wanted to really go steal
[14:25.200 --> 14:31.840]  something from some parking lot or something. So I went to Worms Way and I bought, we had 400
[14:32.560 --> 14:38.160]  watt HPS, 400 watt metal halides with the big fricking ballasts that would sit on the floor
[14:38.160 --> 14:44.560]  and hum. And then we were using, to be honest with you, I can't even remember the brand name
[14:44.560 --> 14:49.200]  because it was just A and B. There was a bottle of yellow stuff and there was a bottle of blue
[14:49.200 --> 14:55.360]  stuff and you mix them in certain portions for flour and for veg and you added Epsom salts. That
[14:55.360 --> 15:00.640]  was pretty much it. You check your pH, you put your A and B in, you mix it, and you add your
[15:00.720 --> 15:05.840]  Epsom salts. You put your A and B in and we were using rockwool in flood tubs. I had some other
[15:05.840 --> 15:14.400]  friends though that started using soil. And what we found was that the people who were using soil
[15:14.400 --> 15:21.680]  had better tasting cannabis to us back in the day. And the cannabis we were growing in the tub
[15:22.240 --> 15:28.720]  was good. And we even, you know, we were doing some initial teas with using a bag with like
[15:29.280 --> 15:37.520]  seabird guano and back guano and putting it in the bag and letting the flood tub run through that
[15:38.240 --> 15:45.520]  brew, almost a natural approach. But again, the flavors were never as fully developed as the stuff
[15:45.520 --> 16:00.320]  that was being grown in soil to me at the time. Then around 1992, I had a kid. And so I also,
[16:00.320 --> 16:08.000]  about that time, right before I had the child, we actually got held up. So I had some people break
[16:08.000 --> 16:14.320]  into my house. We were held at gunpoint. They robbed us. I had a grow going at the time. So
[16:14.320 --> 16:20.640]  I was totally freaked out about them coming back in the grow. And I had a kid on the way. And it
[16:20.640 --> 16:25.840]  was definitely, I was like, this is not where I want to be. Florida is a very dangerous place.
[16:27.120 --> 16:34.960]  And so I basically got out of growing and stopped growing and took basically a 20 year hiatus,
[16:35.840 --> 16:45.760]  focused more on my IT career, and just became a consumer. And used fortunately all of my
[16:45.760 --> 16:51.280]  connections while I was still in Florida to continue to get great homegrown from all of my
[16:51.280 --> 16:56.880]  friends in that grower circle. So I was never without when I was in Florida. But when I moved
[16:56.880 --> 17:01.680]  back up here to Massachusetts, I had to start reestablishing all those start reestablishing
[17:01.680 --> 17:08.800]  connections, even making that initial purchase and admitting that I was a cannabis smoker
[17:09.600 --> 17:17.120]  in 2001 to other IT people, because those were the only people I knew was very difficult, very hard.
[17:18.400 --> 17:28.720]  Right. Now, I got right before I moved from Providence to New York, my apartment got broken
[17:28.720 --> 17:34.960]  into. And, you know, you're always kind of ratcheting up like first you can afford a pound,
[17:35.520 --> 17:39.920]  right, you can afford two pounds. And like, you know, the more bulk you buy, the deeper the
[17:39.920 --> 17:46.240]  discount. So you're ratcheting it up. And finally, I would you know, it's like, to get all your
[17:46.240 --> 17:52.080]  inventory cleaned out. I mean, one that part sucks. It's just a kick in the nuts. But then
[17:52.080 --> 17:56.000]  also it's just freaky thing. You know, my mind started racing because I was always thinking
[17:56.000 --> 18:01.440]  about, you know, you think Boston Providence. I mean, you don't want to get pulled over by a
[18:01.440 --> 18:09.840]  mass state trooper. And and then just to think that people knew that I what I had and broke
[18:09.840 --> 18:16.880]  into my place like they know where you live. It's not like you can move fast. Right. And that was my
[18:16.880 --> 18:23.600]  my end of my Providence, you know, before, you know, before I moved to New York. Yeah, I think
[18:24.160 --> 18:31.280]  within like two weeks, we somehow connived the apartment building we were living at to let us
[18:31.280 --> 18:35.920]  move to a different apartment. At least that was like the fastest thing we could do was move to at
[18:35.920 --> 18:40.960]  least to a different apartment within the same complex so that if they tried to come back,
[18:40.960 --> 18:45.600]  they wouldn't find us at that same spot. But man, you know, talk about scary times.
[18:46.160 --> 18:51.600]  Really, really terrifying. And well, and then I think about, you know, what would have happened
[18:51.600 --> 18:57.920]  had I been home when they broke in? I mean, I'm just like, I'm happy that I actually wasn't there
[18:57.920 --> 19:04.480]  when they broke in. Right. I've been on the floor face down with a gun in my back. Not a fun feeling.
[19:05.120 --> 19:11.680]  Not a fun feeling. So I was like, I'm I don't understand this. I'm just a happy pot smoker.
[19:12.240 --> 19:17.440]  I don't need all of this chaos and crime and all of the rest of this stuff. So I'm getting away
[19:17.440 --> 19:23.440]  from it. That's it. I've had enough. So I got out of it and I stopped for a long time. And,
[19:24.320 --> 19:30.800]  you know, because of the legality of it or illegality of it, and because of the way that,
[19:32.400 --> 19:39.600]  you know, kids are, the way that kids talk, the way that they somewhat brainwash children into
[19:39.600 --> 19:44.720]  ratting on their parents and talking about things that they might do or see. I always
[19:44.720 --> 19:51.040]  tried to keep that stuff away from them. But coincidentally, about the time that they legalized,
[19:51.040 --> 19:57.200]  my kids were already grown. Right. My daughter was in college and she knew that I smoked at that
[19:57.200 --> 20:02.720]  point in time. My son was older and he was already done. So I actually didn't have anything to hide
[20:02.720 --> 20:10.720]  anymore. I was in a legal state. My wife was fine with me going ahead and doing it. And I was like,
[20:10.720 --> 20:16.960]  I'm getting set back up. So I went ahead and went out and bought a tent and a couple of tents,
[20:16.960 --> 20:21.760]  actually, because I knew I did more than one tent. So I bought two tents and I got some
[20:22.560 --> 20:30.800]  basic lighting. I actually started with some T5s and some LEDs. I knew that I did not really
[20:30.800 --> 20:35.280]  want to go back to an HPS or CMH at that point, that I was already looking to go
[20:35.280 --> 20:42.800]  into towards LED, although I did try a CMH for a little while. So I got a couple of tents. I
[20:42.800 --> 20:47.840]  started going to grocery stores and talking to people, started going to cannabis events,
[20:47.840 --> 20:57.760]  trying to meet people because I had a, you know, I had a understanding of what the strains were at
[20:57.760 --> 21:03.840]  the time. I read High Times. I read Ask Ed. I knew, you know, at the time you had Alaskan Thunderfuck
[21:03.840 --> 21:10.240]  and Big Bud and Skunk One and Northern Lights. And you had some of these other great historic
[21:10.240 --> 21:15.840]  strains like Romulan and some of these other things were just starting to come out. But I
[21:16.880 --> 21:24.080]  put that side of my life away for 20 years and I came back in going, what the hell is a Cookies?
[21:25.040 --> 21:37.200]  Right? How do you make that leap from skunk to cookies? What the hell is a gelato? What the
[21:37.200 --> 21:42.560]  hell, you know, what's a runce? Like none of these things made any sense to me. I had no context.
[21:42.560 --> 21:44.400]  What is all this dessert?
[21:44.400 --> 21:51.360]  Right. I had no context of understanding about, to even approach growing again. Like,
[21:51.680 --> 21:59.920]  where do I get seeds? Where do I get clones? The people and the whole context I had are gone.
[22:00.560 --> 22:08.720]  Right. I missed the whole message board thing. Right. I was never part of any of those
[22:09.600 --> 22:14.640]  message boards and growers groups and all that other stuff. I missed those two decades.
[22:15.520 --> 22:22.400]  So to come back into this, I felt I had to meet people. So I started going to cannabis events and
[22:22.400 --> 22:29.680]  talking to breeders. I focused on the people who were selling seeds, not only because I was trying
[22:29.680 --> 22:36.160]  to make that connection again, but what I found was these were the people who actually cared the
[22:36.160 --> 22:42.640]  most about the plant. What I've found is that the people who are really the
[22:44.720 --> 22:51.520]  strong, knowledgeable breeders who truly work at it as an art, understand, love, and respect this
[22:51.520 --> 22:57.280]  plant more than anybody else. And those were the people I wanted to talk to and learn from to get
[22:57.280 --> 23:06.080]  back into it, to get that context so that I could figure out what I wanted to grow and what had
[23:06.080 --> 23:13.120]  happened really with the genetics over the last two decades. So it was very interesting.
[23:14.720 --> 23:22.880]  I had a similar kind of, you know, in New York. So now we're like 98, 99 and probably starting in
[23:22.880 --> 23:33.680]  2000. Every time I'd smoke, I went from always being giggly and eating lots of food and chatting
[23:33.680 --> 23:41.200]  away with my friends to suddenly I'd go out to a bar and just be like, I just want to be by myself.
[23:41.200 --> 23:46.080]  And I didn't like it. So I just more occasionally smoked by myself and I took a big break.
[23:47.760 --> 23:52.800]  Like I love some good old school New York Thai stick.
[23:54.800 --> 24:01.760]  Or some good old school New York chocolate Thai. Those are the things that I remember from my youth
[24:01.840 --> 24:06.320]  that were just like amazing when you occasionally get a hold of something like that. That was just
[24:06.320 --> 24:09.840]  awesome. I'm still kind of chasing some of those flavors.
[24:10.560 --> 24:15.440]  Well, so that's what I was going to ask. You come back into this world that almost you have like,
[24:16.000 --> 24:22.000]  it's like you went into a coma and then you woke up, you know, 15 years later and you're like,
[24:22.000 --> 24:28.960]  all right, what's up? So what did you gravitate towards? What was catching your attention?
[24:28.960 --> 24:37.680]  Well, so the things that first I started trying to track down, obviously the things that I knew,
[24:37.680 --> 24:42.720]  like how can I find some skunk one? You know, who's got the skunk one? Who's got that really
[24:44.080 --> 24:49.680]  strong skunk? There was other things that I was looking for. Like I loved sour diesel, so
[24:49.680 --> 24:56.240]  maybe I can check out some sours. I have never, you know, one of the things that used to bug me
[24:56.960 --> 25:04.400]  when I was a consumer was I wasn't a big fan of lemons. I would get these lemons that just tasted
[25:04.400 --> 25:10.880]  like pledge and I didn't enjoy smoking them. And you know, I would, unfortunately, most of the time
[25:10.880 --> 25:15.680]  when I was buying, I didn't have a lot of choices. So I would just buy whatever was available,
[25:15.680 --> 25:23.280]  whatever my guy had. And there usually wasn't a choice. And I would always, I hated lemons. They
[25:23.280 --> 25:29.520]  just was the thing I did not want to smoke. So I stayed away from anything that was lemon. I knew
[25:29.520 --> 25:35.280]  right away that I didn't want anything lemon. I like cherry. I always was a huge fan of the goofy
[25:35.280 --> 25:40.800]  grape that we grew back in the day. So grape was a flavor I was looking for cherries and grapes,
[25:40.800 --> 25:48.560]  sours, skunk, and I love pine. I'm a big fan of pine. That's why I always liked Northern Lights.
[25:49.440 --> 25:58.400]  So those were the, I knew essentially the kinds of flavors that I liked. I also knew that I was
[25:58.400 --> 26:07.200]  always more of a fan of the heavier Indica type effects, right? I like the more hallucinogenic.
[26:07.760 --> 26:16.080]  I like the more, not necessarily couch lock, but relaxing internal type of a high.
[26:16.960 --> 26:24.640]  I'm not a big fan of things that are heavy on the head. Like I don't like headband. I'm not
[26:24.640 --> 26:29.760]  a big fan of headband. I don't like that feeling in my head. I'm more of a body effect person. So
[26:29.760 --> 26:36.160]  I think I already had some of that context. And so I was able to talk to breeders and say,
[26:37.680 --> 26:45.680]  you know, here's the things I like. And also the other question that I love to ask breeders when
[26:45.680 --> 26:52.080]  I go and talk with these guys, especially initially was what are the things that nobody
[26:52.080 --> 26:57.520]  else is growing that other people have slept on that you think are awesome, right?
[26:57.520 --> 27:02.160]  Oh, a hundred percent. Yeah. Now it's what do you grow for yourself? Not for the market.
[27:02.160 --> 27:09.680]  Right. You know, one of my favorite plants I've ever grown was actually an auto from Mephisto
[27:10.000 --> 27:18.560]  and it was sour livers, right? Now, when that came out, nobody bought those packs
[27:19.440 --> 27:22.640]  because who the hell wants something that smells and tastes like liver?
[27:24.320 --> 27:29.520]  Well, if you read the description on it, you would have found out that liver actually comes
[27:29.520 --> 27:35.280]  from the strain that went around Europe. And especially in the UK, that was called the liver
[27:35.280 --> 27:39.840]  because it kept living on and on and on and on. And then nothing to do with the meat.
[27:42.400 --> 27:50.000]  And so it actually had this amazing, sour, beautiful flavor. It was one of the largest
[27:50.000 --> 27:56.480]  yielding plants I've ever grown and just fantastic. But people slept on it because of the name.
[27:57.440 --> 28:05.120]  So when I talk to the breeders, I'm like, what did you love that everybody else ignored? Because to
[28:05.120 --> 28:12.240]  me, that's what I want to grow. I very rarely am growing something mainstream that other people are
[28:12.240 --> 28:19.120]  growing. I have grown, obviously some, I did grow a GMO cross. I have done some cookie stuff,
[28:20.000 --> 28:24.640]  but primarily most of the stuff I'm growing is not something that you're going to find
[28:25.600 --> 28:31.920]  normally being grown in most people's gardens. You may see some of the breeders, like Jinx is
[28:31.920 --> 28:38.080]  very popular. You see Jinx all over the place. But most people were growing nine pound hammer or
[28:38.080 --> 28:46.640]  safety meeting or one of the mainstreams. I grew a lot of madcap, which was a exclusive seed.
[28:47.440 --> 28:51.840]  And it was a cross between nine pound hammer and mother's tongue, which were two of his bigger
[28:51.840 --> 28:58.240]  strains. So that's what I tend to gravitate towards. And as I've built relationships
[28:58.240 --> 29:02.880]  with breeders over time, it's more like, Hey man, what are you working on? What's coming down
[29:02.880 --> 29:07.680]  the pipe that you think is awesome? Let me know. I'm happy to throw something in the garden to
[29:07.680 --> 29:15.840]  test it out for you, to do a growing show of this strain and check it out. The last one I did was,
[29:15.840 --> 29:24.000]  I just did two for Jinx. I did a morning vibe and problem child. And I love that problem child. Wow.
[29:24.000 --> 29:30.080]  Amazing. One of the best things I've grown. One of my favorite plants to smoke.
[29:30.080 --> 29:35.680]  Yeah. I believe there was a Jinx sighting in Oklahoma yesterday or the day before.
[29:35.680 --> 29:38.000]  I think Brandon posted a picture with him.
[29:38.000 --> 29:40.080]  Yeah. He was out at the Cowboy Cup.
[29:40.800 --> 29:43.520]  Yeah. And then someone says,
[29:43.520 --> 29:44.240]  Miss Rose loved the travel.
[29:44.960 --> 29:46.880]  Can you see that comment on the screen?
[29:48.160 --> 29:48.880]  Yep.
[29:48.880 --> 29:49.760]  Is that accurate?
[29:50.320 --> 29:56.880]  Um, I do not know that or not, but I will say it is, it is an old school cut. And like I said, if
[29:57.840 --> 30:02.880]  the, uh, the details on the packaging from Mephisto had that information around the fact
[30:02.880 --> 30:07.920]  that it was an old school strain that did, it was called the liver because it just kept living on
[30:07.920 --> 30:14.160]  and on and on. Um, and it did float around the UK and Europe. So, uh, that's my knowledge on the
[30:14.160 --> 30:21.120]  strain. Um, so yeah, I think that's, um, you know, what the types of things that I tend to
[30:21.840 --> 30:29.040]  gravitate towards, um, in general, I'm always trying to grow something. I want to smoke,
[30:29.600 --> 30:35.360]  right. I'm not growing something because it's, um, popular. I'm growing something because I
[30:35.360 --> 30:38.160]  want to smoke it. Nothing's worse than growing a plant that you don't want to smoke.
[30:38.800 --> 30:39.300]  Yes.
[30:39.760 --> 30:45.520]  Right. Um, there have been plants that I haven't necessarily enjoyed. And so I just give them away
[30:45.520 --> 30:50.960]  for the most part. Uh, fortunately I grow more weed than I can smoke. And so I usually have,
[30:50.960 --> 30:56.400]  uh, a good amount to give away and I do tend to give away a good amount, not as much as I used to,
[30:56.400 --> 31:00.880]  unfortunately, because there's very few events to go to. Um, but I do tend to walk around at
[31:00.880 --> 31:05.120]  events with jars and just hand out weed because I love to give away cannabis. It's one of the
[31:05.120 --> 31:09.440]  most fun things in the world to me. Uh, nothing is better than the look on somebody's face when
[31:09.440 --> 31:14.560]  you hand them a handful of weed and just go here, right? Like that's like a beautiful,
[31:14.560 --> 31:24.240]  beautiful thing. Um, and, and part of why I do what I do, um, I share what I'm doing and how
[31:24.240 --> 31:30.800]  I'm growing and how I'm being successful and all those things because I want everybody else to grow
[31:30.880 --> 31:35.680]  and be successful too. If everybody who smoked grew their own weed, it would be free because
[31:35.680 --> 31:41.840]  there would be so much out there. We would just be like giving it to each other. We would be trading
[31:41.840 --> 31:47.040]  it and you know, he would be making, uh, pictures out of it and doing all sorts of fun stuff with
[31:47.040 --> 31:52.640]  it because there would be so much of it. Right. Um, you know, overgrowing the planet I think is
[31:52.640 --> 31:58.800]  a great type of a philosophy. So I want others to be successful. That's why I share what I do,
[31:58.800 --> 32:06.400]  what I'm using, how, you know, what my process is, how I do different things. I show, uh, I try
[32:06.400 --> 32:13.360]  to help answer questions whenever I can. I answer almost every DM I get unless it's somebody saying,
[32:13.360 --> 32:18.720]  Hey, give me weed or Hey, can I have some seeds or stuff like that? Those are DMS that I usually
[32:18.720 --> 32:24.320]  tell them no or just ignore altogether. Um, but for the most part, anybody who's ever asked me a,
[32:24.320 --> 32:31.040]  a grow question or reached out to me to, you know, ask my advice on seeds or plants or
[32:31.760 --> 32:37.680]  pests or anything, I try to always answer those to the best of my knowledge or point them to good
[32:37.680 --> 32:42.640]  sources of information for that. Well, let, let's actually get to, well, I want to get to two things,
[32:42.640 --> 32:47.920]  one, some education and then two, just kind of what your current setup is and what you're
[32:47.920 --> 32:53.600]  currently growing and talk about it. So what, what are some questions that you've,
[32:53.600 --> 32:56.800]  you've gotten recently that you thought were great questions that,
[32:58.560 --> 33:04.560]  Um, so I don't know about things that are great questions necessarily. I get a lot of
[33:04.560 --> 33:11.520]  common questions, right? Um, common questions around, uh, good things to you. You know,
[33:12.240 --> 33:16.240]  one of the most popular questions I get is what is on top of your pots?
[33:18.000 --> 33:24.160]  Right. So what type of mulch are you using? Yeah. Um, so I actually use, uh, mostly rice holes,
[33:24.160 --> 33:28.320]  but I started using, I've started using a combination of different things along with
[33:28.320 --> 33:34.560]  the rice holes. I'm starting to put some, uh, pine shavings and, um, I do always start out with a
[33:34.560 --> 33:39.600]  little bit of Bokashi in there, uh, from Brandon's Bokashi earthworks and also some Bokashi I'm
[33:39.600 --> 33:47.600]  making myself. Um, some, oh, I use a little bit of my, uh, IMO. Um, so I make IMO, which is
[33:47.600 --> 33:52.880]  indigenous microorganisms. So IMO three, I'll sprinkle a little bit of IMO three with the
[33:52.880 --> 33:59.680]  Bokashi and the rice holes and a little bit of the, uh, wood, uh, shavings. And that is a nice,
[33:59.680 --> 34:06.560]  I find it's a nice mycelial garden and maybe a little bit of the, uh, alfalfa in there.
[34:07.200 --> 34:11.600]  So I have, and we got some other people, uh, jumping in to listen.
[34:11.600 --> 34:19.760]  What's going on? How are you doing? It's Theo. Hey Theo. Yeah. We met at the, uh, K and F class,
[34:19.760 --> 34:27.920]  man. Yeah. Back in October. Right on. You're a fellow macehole. I am. Yeah. I'm out on the Cape
[34:27.920 --> 34:34.480]  out on Martha's Vineyard actually. Yeah. Right on brother. Wow. Look at all that hair. Yeah,
[34:34.480 --> 34:38.400]  man. That's going two years strong now. It's starting to fucking turn into dreads now.
[34:38.400 --> 34:44.800]  Yeah. So I think that's, you know, it's a good, it's a good point to bring up. Right. So, um,
[34:44.800 --> 34:50.480]  about a year and a half ago, it'll be actually two years in February. I started my journey
[34:50.480 --> 34:58.160]  towards natural, uh, regenerative practices. Um, so fortunately my buddy, Ben Morgan,
[34:58.240 --> 35:06.080]  uh, Katie of family farms, uh, convinced me to go to the, uh, uh, regenerative cannabis
[35:06.080 --> 35:12.160]  cultivation conference in Maine that was hosted by Josh, Joshua Rutherford and light Morrison.
[35:12.160 --> 35:19.280]  Um, and so I went to that event and I saw Chris Trump and, uh, Elaine Ingram and Suzanne, the bug
[35:19.280 --> 35:27.440]  lady and Steve Reisner and, uh, got to meet a bunch of great folks as well at that event. And,
[35:27.440 --> 35:32.000]  um, that's actually what started me on my regenerative journey. Brandon, what's going on,
[35:32.000 --> 35:42.240]  my brother, how you doing out in the okay. See what's going on. Um, that was, that was an eye
[35:42.240 --> 35:47.680]  opening event to me. I walked away from that event going, wow, I've been doing everything wrong my
[35:47.680 --> 35:53.520]  entire life. Um, I need to go. And I was like, I need to go get a worm bin and I need to go ahead
[35:53.520 --> 35:59.440]  and go get some beds and I need to go do this. And then I was like, wait a minute, stop, slow
[35:59.440 --> 36:09.920]  down. Um, you don't need to do all that stuff. It's a slow, it can be a slow step by step process
[36:09.920 --> 36:16.720]  to slowly wean yourself off of things that you buy. You can slowly start to replace what you do,
[36:17.520 --> 36:24.720]  um, in that approach. And then, um, following that October, uh, following that event in
[36:24.720 --> 36:31.040]  February, the following October, I went to Chris Trump's five day hands-on class
[36:31.040 --> 36:40.960]  with my buddy here who's looking like a Wookiee now. Um, and, um, got to learn about K and F
[36:40.960 --> 36:47.360]  firsthand. Um, I had already started moving away from bottled nutrients. I started using
[36:47.360 --> 36:55.680]  super soils like, uh, M3 Michigan made and, uh, the, um, uh, the main, uh, Costa main,
[36:56.240 --> 37:01.680]  uh, Stonington blend where the two main soils I was using, I was already using fish shit,
[37:01.680 --> 37:08.640]  uh, as a product to start bringing in additional bacteria and things into my grow. Uh, I had
[37:08.640 --> 37:15.440]  already been using things like a grower's recharge, which is a lot of microbes and humic acid.
[37:15.440 --> 37:18.640]  Um, so I think I was already kind of moving in that direction.
[37:18.640 --> 37:23.760]  Well, that, and that, that's what I was going to ask. Like, where were you in your, I mean,
[37:23.760 --> 37:29.520]  it's not like you were doing hydro, like you were doing soil. And so like you're here and you're
[37:29.520 --> 37:34.960]  starting to move this way. Yeah. So I, uh, when I got back into growing, the first thing I did,
[37:34.960 --> 37:43.040]  I started out with, uh, soil with, um, I went with general organics was the first box. I bought
[37:43.040 --> 37:50.720]  a box set from general organics, some Vagonik special sauce, uh, which is a powdered tea input.
[37:50.720 --> 37:56.000]  Um, and that was basically where I got going. And then I went and I, uh, because of the events I was
[37:56.000 --> 38:01.840]  going to, I actually went through six different, I tried six different nutrient lines, start to
[38:01.920 --> 38:08.400]  finish. I tried different soil combinations. I tried straight cocoa. Uh, so I did a run with
[38:08.400 --> 38:17.440]  heavy 16 and straight cocoa. Um, I did sweet leaf. I did flora flex. I did general organics. Um, I
[38:17.440 --> 38:26.560]  ran, um, many one from green planet for like a year, cause that was a really good organic product.
[38:26.560 --> 38:31.120]  Um, but you know, the thing that I found from all the going through six different nutrient lines
[38:31.120 --> 38:38.160]  in a little over a year is they're all the same. The results I was getting was similar. The,
[38:38.160 --> 38:43.760]  the flavors for the most part, hard to judge because I was growing different types of cultivars,
[38:43.760 --> 38:51.120]  but in general, I was getting similar yields, similar results, similar products out of all those
[38:51.120 --> 38:57.520]  different lines. Um, but I was spending a ton of time just measuring and trying to figure out all
[38:57.520 --> 39:03.200]  these different balances and looking at my EC and looking at my pH and worrying about all these
[39:03.200 --> 39:11.440]  other things. And I knew that because they were all the same, that there really was no difference
[39:11.440 --> 39:16.480]  between them and that there could be something else I could be doing instead. And, um, I started
[39:16.480 --> 39:22.320]  again, trying out some of these water only type of approaches. And I did actually a full run with
[39:22.320 --> 39:30.080]  just water only, uh, with the M three soil to see where it ran out of steam. Uh, how much were the
[39:30.080 --> 39:38.160]  nutrients actually helping or actually not doing anything. Right. Um, and I found that I didn't
[39:38.160 --> 39:43.680]  really need as much nutrients over time. I was using half the amounts that were on the bottles,
[39:43.680 --> 39:51.040]  uh, using them every other or every, you know, I've do, uh, two feedings and then a water only
[39:52.000 --> 39:59.760]  trying to thin out how much I was using. But then after going to, uh, the, um, you know,
[40:00.640 --> 40:07.840]  so I didn't, I didn't have any set feeling other than I knew that all of this stuff was similar and
[40:07.840 --> 40:14.400]  that there were different, obviously different approaches. Um, the beds really interested me,
[40:14.400 --> 40:22.480]  but I like to run a perpetual grow. So I'm constantly, I try to move one plant into my
[40:22.480 --> 40:29.920]  flower tent every 30 days is my goal so that I have a constant rotation and I'm always harvesting
[40:29.920 --> 40:36.960]  at least one plant a month and having a big bed with a hundred gallons of soil in it is really
[40:36.960 --> 40:42.560]  hard to move around between tents. Um, and plus you're talking about either running a full cycle
[40:42.560 --> 40:48.320]  or running, um, you know, a straight full flower cycle with that bed and having another bed and
[40:48.320 --> 40:55.440]  veg and it's just the logistics of it where we're a little bit hard to come up with. So, um, going
[40:55.440 --> 40:59.840]  to those conferences, the other thing that they mentioned was that to do true living soil,
[41:00.560 --> 41:08.240]  you really need at least a 35 gallon pot. And as I've moved away from bottled nutrients and I've
[41:08.240 --> 41:14.160]  moved more towards natural approaches, I've started using larger and larger pots because
[41:14.160 --> 41:20.880]  smaller pots, you don't have a big enough biome. You're not allowing enough space for the roots to
[41:20.880 --> 41:28.320]  grow out for that interaction with the bacteria and the fungi and the mycelium to really provide
[41:28.320 --> 41:36.400]  enough structure and nutrient for that plant. Um, so I keep moving out into bigger and bigger pots
[41:36.400 --> 41:42.480]  as I'm moving further and further away from commercial products, uh, to provide a bigger
[41:42.480 --> 41:49.920]  biome. Um, I was growing, you can grow really big plants in three gallon and five gallon pots when
[41:49.920 --> 41:55.760]  you're using nutrients. But when you try to do that and run full cycle, when you're not using
[41:55.760 --> 42:02.560]  nutrients, they run out of steam, you get tons of deficiencies and you limit your yield. Um,
[42:02.560 --> 42:08.000]  so you do need a bigger pot as you move away from those bottled nutrients, you're going to need a
[42:08.000 --> 42:14.000]  larger container so that your biome, which you're depending on to provide nutrients to the plant
[42:15.280 --> 42:22.800]  can support this and sustain the plant. Um, and right now I primarily go, I start out in
[42:22.800 --> 42:27.920]  smaller pots. I moved to a three gallon in the veg space, and then I move them up into an eight
[42:27.920 --> 42:33.520]  gallon pot at least two weeks before I move them into my veg environment so that the roots have
[42:33.520 --> 42:40.880]  time to move into that new space of soil and have room to develop before they get into the flower
[42:40.880 --> 42:48.000]  zone, um, when they actually need all that additional nutrients. So can you give us a tour of the,
[42:48.000 --> 42:54.000]  of the garage operation? Absolutely. Uh, it's actually a basement operation. A basement.
[42:54.000 --> 42:58.320]  Yeah. So I'm going to flip the camera around here. So give me a second.
[43:07.160 --> 43:13.880]  And there we go. Look at that. Right. So you got your press coffee. Yes. Always important.
[43:14.520 --> 43:18.920]  Press coffee. And of course my tick mug.
[43:21.880 --> 43:26.600]  Um, we've got Johnny Ramone helping keep things down here. You know, he's always good to keep
[43:26.600 --> 43:35.960]  things going. And of course some space goes keeping an eye on my jars. Um, so to give,
[43:35.960 --> 43:44.200]  we'll try to get back here a little bit. And so I have two five by five tents here. Um, I also have
[43:44.200 --> 43:52.680]  a small slide on over here. I have a small tent that I use for drying. Okay. Um, so that's where
[43:52.760 --> 43:57.400]  I hang my plants for drying. So a nice dark space that's separate. Is that just a two by four?
[43:57.400 --> 44:04.040]  Yeah. It's just, it's actually a two by three. Okay. Yeah. Um, and because I'm only doing one
[44:04.040 --> 44:10.280]  or two plants at a time again, that's all I need. Um, and then we have the five by five space.
[44:11.160 --> 44:17.480]  I recently got out of my rotation for the first time in about two and a half years. I had no
[44:17.480 --> 44:23.880]  plants in my flower tent, uh, because of the way my cycle had started. So I'm starting to get back
[44:23.880 --> 44:29.240]  into my rotation, which is why I only have three plants in here right now. But ideally there's at
[44:29.240 --> 44:38.680]  least four plants in here. Um, right now we have, uh, three plants up front. We have here is the
[44:39.400 --> 44:49.000]  Bartholomew OG from heroes of the farm. Uh, Pat, fantastic, fantastic guy. Uh, one of the original
[44:49.000 --> 44:58.360]  TGA folks along with jinx and, uh, heroes of the farm. So this is, um, a, uh, I think it's a dog
[44:58.360 --> 45:06.760]  Walker crossed with space dude. So you get that space balls Bartholomew reference in there. Um,
[45:06.760 --> 45:17.640]  and this is at 30 days today, getting some nice frost on there. Let's see if I can zoom in.
[45:18.120 --> 45:22.120]  There we go. Are you using a bit of color starting to pick in?
[45:24.920 --> 45:32.040]  Got some nice, uh, this plant is one of those plants that won't grow tall. Um,
[45:32.600 --> 45:36.520]  one of the things that I love about the Bartholomew OG is it won't get tall. I've tried
[45:36.520 --> 45:43.400]  to veg it out, veg it out. It just gets wider. Um, so that's really, really a nice trait. Um,
[45:43.960 --> 45:54.360]  over here we have the cats, Sue's wonder. So this is a, um, Bubba cats, Sue crossed with a Williams
[45:55.320 --> 46:03.960]  wonder. And this is from stray Fox or stray mindset, uh, on Instagram. And, uh, this is a nice,
[46:04.600 --> 46:13.320]  uh, citrusy light cush flavored plant. Uh, this one I had trained out. I actually removed
[46:13.880 --> 46:19.560]  most, you'll see these black stacks here. Uh, I had this whole plant trained out in the trainer.
[46:20.280 --> 46:26.200]  So I got a really nice wide canopy. Um, I pulled the trainer out so I could get in here actually,
[46:26.200 --> 46:31.640]  uh, yesterday and pull some of the dead leaves and thin out the canopy a little bit for the last 30
[46:31.640 --> 46:40.760]  days. Um, but also again, nice and frosty starting to get some color, uh, on 30 days right now.
[46:41.480 --> 46:49.480]  Also. So these two plants went in at the same time and, um, they are on 30 days today.
[46:50.200 --> 46:58.440]  And then behind it, we have this monster, which is stretching like crazy, uh, which is a banana
[46:58.440 --> 47:06.280]  lights. Uh, so it's a banana OG crossed with Northern lights, five NL five, one of my favs.
[47:06.280 --> 47:11.480]  So, uh, starting, I've been trying to track down some of those old flavors. This has a really nice
[47:11.480 --> 47:17.880]  soft pine. So I think that banana is smoothing out some of the pine, but it's really nice.
[47:17.880 --> 47:26.840]  It's got some of the nice big fat staves with that teardrop shape. Um, that really reminds me
[47:26.840 --> 47:38.360]  of some of the older school strains. Um, and this is on day 15 today. So really getting those buds
[47:38.360 --> 47:44.920]  developing. You had some nice stretch to make room for those tops, um, traditional shape.
[47:48.500 --> 47:54.500]  So what else about my tent? So up here, we've got, uh, the science led raging Kush,
[47:55.460 --> 48:01.860]  uh, which is, I think they call it a thousand watt equivalent. I think it's about 650,
[48:01.860 --> 48:08.340]  680 Watts, the box or something along those lines. I actually dropped the wattage I had in here.
[48:08.340 --> 48:17.220]  I was previously running two, uh, dragon SLS from science led at 1200 Watts, but I actually had to
[48:17.220 --> 48:23.140]  run the lights at around 60 to 70% intensity because it was just too much wattage for the
[48:23.140 --> 48:33.220]  space and, um, swapping out to a slightly smaller light actually that had three bars instead of just
[48:33.220 --> 48:42.260]  the two bars gave me better cover light coverage, a better cross lighting and, um, less shadows.
[48:42.260 --> 48:50.100]  I think better light coverage overall. So veg tent, eight gallon pots. These are all, uh,
[48:50.100 --> 49:00.260]  fabric pots from honor cannabis. Um, they're made of a nice, really easy to clean material.
[49:00.260 --> 49:05.940]  Uh, these pots have all been through multiple cycles, um, clean them up with a little bit of
[49:05.940 --> 49:11.220]  soap and water and a little tiny bit of bleach. And they're good to go back into action. Um,
[49:11.220 --> 49:17.940]  I also like the fabric pots because you get good air pruning, um, on the sides of the pots,
[49:17.940 --> 49:25.780]  uh, nice drainage and airflow. Uh, as I mentioned on top here, uh, this is actually some of the,
[49:27.380 --> 49:33.140]  this grass is actually coming from my IMO. Some of the seeds in my IMO, uh, tend to pop. It's not
[49:33.140 --> 49:40.100]  actually cover crop, but, uh, sometimes the natural things will pop up in here. Um, this is mostly
[49:40.100 --> 49:46.580]  rice holes, but there is some, uh, wood shavings in here. Um, I think I have a couple, a little bit
[49:46.580 --> 49:54.580]  of the barley holes maybe. Um, but for the most part, it's mostly rice holes and some of Brandon's,
[49:54.580 --> 50:01.060]  uh, Bokashi earthworks is in here. So I always put a little bit of the Bokashi, uh, and some of my
[50:01.060 --> 50:08.180]  IMO on the lower layer, right before I put this nice layer of rice holes on the top, um, sticky
[50:08.260 --> 50:15.940]  traps, of course, to help with, uh, fungus gnats and keep any, uh, pests away. I do not use any,
[50:15.940 --> 50:24.100]  uh, sprays. I tend to go with predators. Um, so you can actually see I've got a box hanging right
[50:24.100 --> 50:31.380]  here, uh, from beneficial insectary. And this was for some, uh, persimilis that I just released
[50:31.380 --> 50:38.580]  because unfortunately I have, uh, some spider mites, um, that I've brought into the house somehow.
[50:38.580 --> 50:44.900]  Um, this has been the year of insects for me. Unfortunately, I've had this year, I've had to
[50:44.900 --> 50:51.460]  fight, uh, fungus gnats, which I'm always fighting, but I've had thrips, I've had aphids, and now
[50:52.340 --> 50:57.540]  I've had spider mites. So, um, I'm dealing with different types of predators. I'm bringing in
[50:57.540 --> 51:03.940]  predators. I'm going to bring in another set of predators in this week, um, to try to counteract,
[51:03.940 --> 51:10.500]  uh, the insects. Uh, for the most part, plants are pretty happy, uh, but I have seen some signs of
[51:10.500 --> 51:17.380]  some of the damage on some of the leaves. Um, let's see if we can zoom in here. You can see
[51:17.780 --> 51:36.240]  on that leaf right there, there's some white, there's some white patterning on the leaves here.
[51:36.240 --> 51:42.160]  And that's from the spider mites. Spider mites are hard to find, uh, they're really, really small.
[51:42.160 --> 51:49.280]  You have to look at the undersides of leaves, um, and you really have to use, um, a good microscope
[51:49.280 --> 51:57.600]  or a good, even, even your normal, uh, loop is good enough for taking a look at, uh, insects
[51:58.560 --> 52:05.520]  and, uh, finding out what might be causing you some problems. So that's veg. I'm sorry, that's
[52:05.520 --> 52:16.720]  flour. Cannabis is not a crime. Um, and then we have the, uh, veg tent. So again, another five by
[52:16.720 --> 52:33.160]  five tent. Um, nice, nice and nice and warm in there right now. So, um, we've got a lot of plants
[52:33.160 --> 52:39.400]  of different ages in the veg tent right now. Um, as I said, because I am running a cycle,
[52:39.400 --> 52:48.600]  um, I do try to pop seeds every 45 days or so. Um, and then depending on whether those plants
[52:48.600 --> 52:53.560]  are males or females, obviously we'll pull the males out, keep the females. And then eventually
[52:53.560 --> 52:59.640]  the females will get up potted into five, uh, into eight gallon pots to be put into flour.
[53:00.440 --> 53:08.520]  Um, so over here, let's see. Uh, so this is a black lime reserve cross with Kanasu,
[53:09.560 --> 53:15.640]  uh, from Yellow Hammer Genetics. We've, this one I'm really looking forward to. This is the 92
[53:15.640 --> 53:25.560]  burst, which is a sunset, uh, a Sherbert, um, starburst crossed with a, uh, OG, a old school
[53:25.560 --> 53:33.000]  San Francisco OG. Um, what else we got in here? Uh, we've got, these are in the back here. These
[53:33.000 --> 53:40.920]  are the black lime reserve F2 cuts from Kevin Jodry, uh, that he sent me. So I'm really super
[53:40.920 --> 53:45.800]  excited. Those are doing well, getting some nice fat leaves there. Good color. Another one of the
[53:46.360 --> 53:55.160]  bursts. Um, we've got, let's see what else we got in here. There's the other BLR. Oh, Fizzy Bubbly.
[53:55.800 --> 54:03.400]  That's what it is. Fizzy Bubbly from Aficionado. Uh, this was one of the packs Leo gave me. Um,
[54:03.960 --> 54:10.520]  then over here, this is a haze crossed with skunk one crossed with Northern Lights,
[54:11.240 --> 54:16.760]  and then another one of the same, but they both have completely different morphologies. Um,
[54:17.320 --> 54:25.560]  where this one is very Northern Lights heavy, where this one is actually more haze, um, heavy.
[54:25.560 --> 54:29.000]  And unfortunately they're a little saggy right now. They got fed heavy this morning,
[54:29.000 --> 54:32.680]  so they're definitely a bit down. They should perk up by later this afternoon.
[54:33.640 --> 54:43.240]  Um, but there's the veg tent. I built some small rolling tables, uh, to put these two by four
[54:43.240 --> 54:51.000]  trays on, uh, to keep the plants off the ground in the winter. And then I took, um, I mentioned
[54:51.000 --> 54:57.400]  earlier those 1200 Watts, the two Dragon SLs. Well, I took one of the Dragons and I put them
[54:57.400 --> 55:03.880]  in here. So I'm now running only 600 Watts, uh, with the Dragon SL covering this whole five by
[55:03.880 --> 55:15.480]  five tent. Um, and that is the veg area. Uh, what else do I got going on down here? We got lots of
[55:15.480 --> 55:21.480]  good stuff going on. I'll bring it over here. So, uh, right now I'm playing with some cover crops.
[55:22.440 --> 55:26.600]  Um, so I've got some, actually some basil growing in here with a bunch of cover crop
[55:26.600 --> 55:30.360]  and some mugwort, uh, which I was going to, which I may use for an FPJ.
[55:31.720 --> 55:37.800]  Uh, this is a madcap mother. So this is my madcap mother plant, which I'm keeping.
[55:38.360 --> 55:42.040]  Uh, this is running, I've got a nice led panel out here, keeping things going.
[55:43.000 --> 55:50.200]  And then we've got my, um, ferments, all my natural ferments, uh, pretty much everything
[55:50.360 --> 55:57.720]  on my shelf at this point is something I made myself, which to me is really where all of my
[55:57.720 --> 56:04.680]  effort has been this year has been focusing on trying to make my own high quality inputs
[56:05.400 --> 56:14.040]  to care for my plants. Um, and most recently I just made my first bucket of Bokashi. So,
[56:14.760 --> 56:19.640]  uh, moving away from Bokashi, moving into Bokashi, I will continue to use your stuff,
[56:19.640 --> 56:27.400]  Brandon. Don't worry about it. Um, I also have over here a very small worm bin.
[56:30.120 --> 56:35.000]  So I know you mentioned worms earlier. Well, I converted this small little spinach box
[56:35.560 --> 56:42.040]  with some cedar into a nice little worm bin. There's one of them running around right there.
[56:45.360 --> 56:50.160]  And so I'm getting some nice worms going in here.
[57:01.180 --> 57:04.700]  And are those all the same? Like, are they all red wigglers or all?
[57:04.700 --> 57:11.980]  All red wrigglers. Yep. All red wrigglers. And occasionally one of them will jump, ship,
[57:13.260 --> 57:15.900]  escape, and then I just throw them in the pot.
[57:16.060 --> 57:23.500]  Give them a new home. And are you just feeding them kind of food scraps? Yep. Yep. Coffee grounds,
[57:23.500 --> 57:29.980]  uh, some ground up eggshells. And, uh, occasionally, you know, I'll clip a couple little
[57:29.980 --> 57:35.020]  pieces off of here and just throw it into the bucket. Um, I've given them some of the, uh,
[57:35.020 --> 57:41.820]  Bokashi cause they like Bokashi, um, as well to eat. So that's pretty much what's going on.
[57:42.780 --> 57:44.860]  Flip this thing back around here.
[57:47.340 --> 57:54.780]  And then, um, are, are you growing mostly from seed or are you also growing from a clone?
[57:54.780 --> 57:59.260]  Sorry, I didn't get that. Sorry. Are you, cause you were talking about poppy and beans. So do
[57:59.260 --> 58:04.220]  you have like your, I'm having a really bad connection for some reason. I'm sorry. I'm
[58:04.220 --> 58:08.940]  having a really bad connection. I'm sorry. I'm having a really bad connection. I'm sorry.
[58:09.900 --> 58:13.420]  I'm having a really bad connection for some reason right now. That's not even coming through for me.
[58:15.740 --> 58:21.500]  Why don't, um, let me, uh, jump off and jump back. I might have to jump off and jump back in here.
[58:21.500 --> 58:26.700]  Okay. I'll be right back. Yes. This is, uh, how we did our, Oh my God. It's four other,
[58:26.700 --> 58:34.120]  three other people. What are you guys doing here? Brandon, I, uh, I got eight lime,
[58:34.680 --> 58:40.440]  seedlings going. Yeah. The lamb, Lime one BX. Sorry for this. You're going to find some really
[58:41.400 --> 58:48.600]  how do you flip this camera? You got to hit the cog. You have to hit the cog and, uh,
[58:48.600 --> 58:55.880]  then pick your camera source. And yeah, I ended the link through the, I entered it through the email.
[58:56.840 --> 59:05.000]  Oh, it gave you the, it gave you the leave conversation option. Uh, so do you have the
[59:05.000 --> 59:10.040]  trophy close by? Uh, yeah, hold on. I'm going to flex a little bit.
[59:18.520 --> 59:21.960]  I was really excited. I mean, I wanted first,
[59:22.920 --> 59:25.720]  obviously everybody does when they enter a competition.
[59:28.280 --> 59:31.240]  The cool thing was that I, uh, I entered my own
[59:31.960 --> 59:38.040]  genetics, you know, somebody else or something that I created and grew myself. So
[59:42.600 --> 59:46.920]  right. I'm back, but that's it right there.
[59:47.880 --> 59:53.640]  Let's look at the, uh, there we go. Look at that. Nice dude. Congratulations, my friend.
[59:54.520 --> 01:00:02.760]  Thanks. Um, but yeah, so I, you know, like I said, I've been focused very much since I went to Chris
[01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:11.640]  Trump's, uh, session, uh, to just working on my own inputs. Uh, I've built since last year,
[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:18.200]  I've built a compost pile out back for recycling all my used soil. I have a huge pile of wood chips
[01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:24.600]  that I'm using, uh, additionally as well, uh, to, you know, for inputs and for things like that.
[01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:32.040]  I've made my IMOs. So I have my IMO three that I'm using, uh, on my weekly teas. I have my worm
[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:36.920]  bin, which I started as well. So I have worm castings, which I throw in there. I just made
[01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:45.960]  my own Bikashi. Uh, so I have composting soil recycling already started so that next year when
[01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:53.240]  I get, um, through all of the soil I have already hurt, I had previously acquired, I'll be ready to
[01:00:53.240 --> 01:01:00.840]  start reusing all of the soil from previous use uses, um, to start regenerating that and trying
[01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:08.680]  to stay more closed loop. Um, the learning I had to do over the last year was primarily trying to
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:15.240]  size things appropriately for an indoor grow. Um, you know, when you take the class, when you take
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:20.200]  Chris Trump's class or you go to any of these other websites or any of these other things,
[01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:26.680]  when you're learning, a lot of the stuff is geared towards farmers, not somebody who's only got a
[01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:32.600]  couple of plants to feed. And so you have to size things down, but you have to make sure they're big
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:40.440]  enough to have, um, an impact so to speak. Right. Um, so trying to figure out whether I use a quart
[01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:47.720]  jar or a pint jar or what size jar to do my fermenting in, even was part of it. You know,
[01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:53.480]  I started moving to bigger jars so that I could have a good, uh, supply that would last a long
[01:01:53.480 --> 01:02:03.160]  enough amount of time in between. Um, but you know, once you get a certain set of components
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:12.120]  created, it's super efficient and super easy to keep the process off. Right. Um, every three to
[01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:21.960]  six months I'm replacing, I have to replace one of the ferments I made blue, all the things I've
[01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:32.040]  been working towards blue with the avocado tech is the next thing on my radar. Um, I have my worm
[01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:41.240]  bin going. Um, I've got my soil recycling plan started. I'm going to be moving hopefully towards
[01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:48.120]  more living soil approaches this coming year. And a major part of that is going to be influenced by
[01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:55.320]  my man blue here with the avocado tech, uh, who also was at that same regenerative conference
[01:02:55.320 --> 01:03:01.640]  that I was at that really started me on my journey. Um, just tremendous, uh, tremendous,
[01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:11.560]  uh, event. I mean, um, really, really changed my life. Um, you know, usually we don't, we don't,
[01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:17.000]  we try not to get too overly emotional about these things sometimes, but the reality is it
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:23.080]  completely changed my life. Changes. It's my active man. Absolutely. Changed my approach to
[01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:32.360]  growing. Um, changed, you know, I honestly feel I'm healthier since changing the way the inputs I
[01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:39.160]  use, uh, the way that the cannabis is grown. I feel like I'm healthier. The stuff that I smoke,
[01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:45.960]  I don't feel as clogged as I used to. I have less allergic reactions than I used to. Uh,
[01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:52.280]  some of it might just be having the constant exposure to all the beneficial bacterias and the
[01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:57.320]  IMOs and the Bukkake and things like that. Uh, some of it may just be the fact that the cannabis
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:02.520]  I'm growing is that much healthier for me to smoke because of the fact that it is so much more
[01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:11.160]  natural. Um, the other thing that I've really, um, I can't talk enough about is the connection I feel
[01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:19.800]  to the plants. When you are creating the inputs, the soil
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:28.920]  focused on every aspect of that life cycle, you have this deeper connection with the plant that
[01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:37.400]  is at a different level. You can almost hear the plants talking to you. You can, you have this
[01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:42.360]  connection, this almost electricity, that energy that flows between you and the plants
[01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:51.720]  that I just, I did not ever experience before. Um, until I started actually making my own inputs,
[01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:57.160]  uh, you feel so much more part of the plant. You're not just pouring something that somebody
[01:04:57.160 --> 01:05:05.480]  told you to do based on some calendar on your plants. You're focusing on the actual life cycle
[01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:12.120]  of the plant. You're raising a living creature and you're caring about it as a living creature.
[01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:17.480]  And you're trying to provide this ultimate environment for it to grow in. It's not
[01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:24.200]  being treated as a commodity. It's not being treated by some scheduled, uh, nonsensical,
[01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:31.880]  uh, thing that has nothing to do with the plant itself. Um, the plant knows
[01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:39.080]  when it's ready for what the plant knows, what nutrients it needs, when, uh, the plant knows
[01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:47.560]  its schedule for its life cycle. We as humans and scientists and all the rest of it, try to
[01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:54.680]  implement this grid, this framework on top of something that's natural and living and isn't
[01:05:55.560 --> 01:06:02.040]  necessarily going to fit that, uh, norm. Um, so that, that connection that I've developed over
[01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:07.880]  the last year and a half, that understanding of the biology, that understanding of how the plants
[01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:14.440]  interact with the inputs I'm putting into it, um, has been tremendous and, uh, can't discount that
[01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:21.640]  enough. So I have a question for all of you, which is, uh, you're, you're growing in pots. So
[01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:29.640]  when you chop, are you then planting right in the same pot or are you dumping all the pots into
[01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:39.640]  maybe a bigger tub or bin and adding amendments and so right back up or? Yeah. So right now I,
[01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:45.240]  uh, in most cases I am not reusing the pots. I'm taking the pots and I'm bringing them. I have a,
[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:51.160]  what I call my reused soil compost pile out back. So, uh, what I've been doing is basically
[01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:57.400]  building, uh, doing traditional lasagna style composting, uh, adding, you know, leaves and
[01:06:57.400 --> 01:07:05.480]  wood chips in between food. So I'm putting a lot of coffee grounds and eggshells. Um, and then as I
[01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:13.320]  take down a, uh, a stump or a pot, um, I basically, I crushed that pot down and I dumped the roots
[01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:19.960]  and the stocks and, uh, rice holes and all those other things that are in there right into that
[01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:29.640]  pile. Um, it's made, it's, it's, you can't do a traditional compote, hot compost pile in this
[01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:34.520]  manner because when you add that soil, it immediately drops the temperature down on your
[01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:39.640]  soil. It doesn't allow necessarily that same type of heating and composting, but if you're doing it
[01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:46.120]  in a lasagna style where, um, you're continuing to slowly add layers and you do occasionally turn
[01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:52.520]  that pile and make holes to add the new food in as you do it. Um, I'm, I'm hoping for some good
[01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:57.080]  success. I will let you know in the spring, uh, when I start reusing it, but everything has been
[01:07:57.080 --> 01:08:03.960]  going into this reuse pile. Uh, the next thing that I'm going to try, uh, which is something new
[01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:12.440]  is because I just made Bokashi, I'm going to try doing an indoor Bokashi compost reuse of soil.
[01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:21.400]  So, uh, with Bokashi and Bokashi composting, normally what you do is you build a bucket of
[01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:26.840]  things that you're composting by layering in food scraps and food waste with layers of Bokashi,
[01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:34.680]  and then you put it into a sealed container for at least two weeks, um, creating an anaerobic
[01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:44.040]  situation while the Bokashi basically ferments those food wastes. And then you dig a trench
[01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:50.840]  in your soil where you dump those fermented wastes in and you cover it up with the soil.
[01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:56.520]  Now, normally you would do this outside in your garden, but you can also, my understanding is,
[01:08:56.520 --> 01:09:04.360]  do this in a bucket or a tote indoors. So I have a bucket of used soil and I'm going to
[01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:10.280]  create a fermented set of Bokashi, and then I'm going to put it into that bucket, into that tote,
[01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:16.520]  mix it up with the soil. It's about a third fermented Bokashi and then two thirds soil
[01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:22.040]  will be the mix. And I'm going to give that a shot and see what that does. Um, see how well that
[01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:27.560]  works in my basement over the winter. Um, because obviously it's a little hard to do hot composting
[01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:32.360]  in the middle of winter up here in New England. Um, but that's going to be one of the things I'm
[01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:39.160]  going to be trying to do to recycle soil. I will over time be moving to these larger pots.
[01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:46.600]  As I showed you earlier, when I was showing you the veg tent, I did build some rolling tables for
[01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:53.800]  those two by four trays. So I'm going to probably move to a two by four bed sometime this year.
[01:09:54.360 --> 01:10:02.920]  And at that point I will move more towards a no till living soil approach with not obviously
[01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:08.920]  dumping the soil out, but taking those beds, growing in those beds, and then probably rolling
[01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:14.360]  those two by four beds from the veg tent to the flower tent, um, and keeping the cycle going that
[01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:23.390]  way. Got it. Anybody else want to jump? So, I mean, my, my question was kind of like, I,
[01:10:23.390 --> 01:10:28.270]  I just chopped down a whole bunch of, uh, I'm looking outside a bunch of tobacco plants that
[01:10:28.270 --> 01:10:35.550]  were in, I don't know, seven and 10 gallon pots and some beans and other stuff. And I threw it
[01:10:35.550 --> 01:10:44.350]  all into like a big bin that I'm now adding some of the, uh, I have a compost tumbler, so I'm taking
[01:10:44.350 --> 01:10:49.790]  some of the finished hot compost and then I have some worm bins and I'm taking some of that and
[01:10:49.790 --> 01:10:56.510]  then adding other stuff. And yeah, cause I, it's like, I have all this, you know, it's like
[01:10:56.510 --> 01:11:02.830]  a bunch of Royal gold soil and it's like, that's my starting point. But hopefully the ending point
[01:11:02.830 --> 01:11:10.270]  is I'm never buying new soil. I'm just adding my own stuff and closing the loop. That's, that's,
[01:11:10.270 --> 01:11:18.590]  that's the goal. I was shaman tobacco. Yeah. I had, uh, I was fortunate enough for, uh, that,
[01:11:18.590 --> 01:11:24.030]  uh, the good, good old boy, Swanee, uh, Swanee Swanson from M three sent me a pallet of soil.
[01:11:25.950 --> 01:11:30.830]  So I had like 40 bags of soil and I'm still working through that set. So right now there's
[01:11:30.830 --> 01:11:37.470]  really no reason to necessarily reuse the set. I'd rather kind of try to work it towards this
[01:11:37.470 --> 01:11:44.990]  reused pile, um, go through the soil I have and then not buy more soil. That's my goal is to not
[01:11:44.990 --> 01:11:51.870]  go buy soil, continue to reuse this and start incorporating the things that I'm making a more
[01:11:51.870 --> 01:11:58.670]  formal compost pile, the recycled bin. Hopefully something comes out of this, but Kashi, um, I,
[01:11:58.670 --> 01:12:04.510]  I think, you know, you can do some cross like this, the, the pot I showed you earlier that had
[01:12:04.510 --> 01:12:10.190]  the basil and the cover crop growing in it. That was a pot that I had a bunch of cannabis growing
[01:12:10.190 --> 01:12:18.670]  in. Uh, so I did run, uh, some Vixen, is it Vixen? No, it was a morning vibe. So I did a run of
[01:12:18.670 --> 01:12:24.110]  morning vibe in that pot. I do. I wouldn't necessarily, because it's only an eight gallon pot,
[01:12:24.910 --> 01:12:30.750]  think that I could run another full cycle of a cannabis plant, but it could be fine for other
[01:12:30.750 --> 01:12:36.750]  plants. Um, especially things like basils and herbs that don't necessarily need all the heavy
[01:12:36.750 --> 01:12:41.870]  nutrients, um, could also be used for an auto flower. If you'd like to do auto flowers,
[01:12:42.430 --> 01:12:47.790]  it's not a bad idea to take a pot that you previously used for a photo period
[01:12:47.790 --> 01:12:52.190]  and then run an auto flower in that same pot because auto flowers don't need a lot of nutrients.
[01:12:54.190 --> 01:13:01.870]  Got it. And for the rest of the crew, uh, on what, uh, I, what, one of the things I wanted to do is
[01:13:01.870 --> 01:13:09.550]  get a bunch of people, uh, and some of you are those people who follow Joda Herb and kind of like,
[01:13:11.630 --> 01:13:16.030]  what, what, like, you know, I think a lot of us see what other people are doing on Instagram. So
[01:13:16.030 --> 01:13:25.170]  what have you guys been noticing or following that he's been doing? Brandon, you're muted.
[01:13:25.490 --> 01:13:33.250]  I had a question for you. Um, the Bokashi that you made, did you use it? Is it an EM Bokashi
[01:13:33.250 --> 01:13:40.530]  or did you make a lab and then just make a lab? I actually used lab and I used your probiotic plus.
[01:13:42.370 --> 01:13:48.270]  Oh yeah. That's what you want to use. Definitely. That'll solid state for me. So I use that,
[01:13:48.430 --> 01:13:56.750]  So I used that, uh, with my own made lab and I did a combination of rice bran.
[01:13:57.470 --> 01:14:06.510]  Uh, it was about, uh, three quarters rice bran. And then I also added some, uh, rice holes, barley
[01:14:06.510 --> 01:14:13.310]  and alfalfa meal, uh, in for the other, other quarter. Um, and that's what I mixed up and I
[01:14:13.310 --> 01:14:21.470]  fermented it for 16 days in, uh, two layers of black plastic trash bags and then dried it out
[01:14:21.470 --> 01:14:27.390]  in a big tray for about three days. Um, till it got really nice and dry. And then I put it into
[01:14:27.390 --> 01:14:36.990]  that, uh, closed top bucket. So ready to rock and roll. When you use the Bokashi, do you see,
[01:14:36.990 --> 01:14:43.550]  uh, population increase with your worm populations? Uh, I have seen a lot of activity
[01:14:43.550 --> 01:14:49.390]  actually, um, in the, in that pot, in the pot that I was showing earlier that has the cover crop in
[01:14:49.390 --> 01:14:54.750]  and I had thrown some Bokashi in it and I had moved like two days later, I moved the layer around a
[01:14:54.750 --> 01:14:58.350]  little bit and it was like, wow, there's a whole, the only, the only couple of worms I had put in
[01:14:58.350 --> 01:15:02.670]  that pot, that's where they're hanging out. Uh, they love it. They absolutely love it. And then
[01:15:02.670 --> 01:15:08.830]  I put some in the worm bin and they've been going nuts, uh, running through it. So they really like
[01:15:08.830 --> 01:15:15.870]  it. Have you ever had issues where there's, or anybody on the panel, um, with, uh, worm
[01:15:15.870 --> 01:15:24.350]  populations exploding and then having worms evacuate beds or pots? I've seen that a little
[01:15:24.350 --> 01:15:31.790]  bit. Definitely. Especially with the use of the Bokashi in, in my tech, definitely like populations
[01:15:31.790 --> 01:15:38.990]  exploding to ridiculous levels. I haven't been using Bokashi in like probably six months now,
[01:15:38.990 --> 01:15:42.670]  and I've noticed the worm population seems to be dwindling. So I'm going to see if there's
[01:15:42.670 --> 01:15:49.630]  a correlation and start using it again and see if that rounded over ball of worms. I'm always
[01:15:49.630 --> 01:15:55.710]  posting the ball of yarn emoji because that's a ball of yarn. But yeah. And you're, you're on what now?
[01:15:56.510 --> 01:16:02.270]  12th cycle in those beds. 11th cycle. 13 in here. Yeah.
[01:16:04.190 --> 01:16:08.910]  Amazing. And I see a whole bunch of babies in the background.
[01:16:10.910 --> 01:16:16.510]  No, those are actually super short squat. Well, they're veg right now, but I've grown them super
[01:16:16.510 --> 01:16:22.350]  short and squat. They're Mac V2s, but they're like less than 18 inches, just like candelabras. And
[01:16:22.350 --> 01:16:26.270]  I'm just like suppressing them. And then I'm going to flip here pretty soon. I want them
[01:16:26.990 --> 01:16:30.270]  to be good. You want to give us a peek inside?
[01:16:34.510 --> 01:16:36.830]  Look at this. How's that?
[01:16:39.870 --> 01:16:45.470]  Say what? I was just going to say, how's that? The Mac V2 smoke, the stuff that you pull down
[01:16:45.470 --> 01:16:51.790]  outside? Really nice. Actually, as you might know, I had to hear, let me see if I can flip my camera.
[01:16:52.990 --> 01:16:58.430]  Yeah. I was following with the whole betrayed us and that whole fucking situation. Yeah.
[01:16:58.430 --> 01:17:02.030]  It's a little early, but it's a, has, I don't know the combination. If you
[01:17:02.910 --> 01:17:07.790]  know max high, it's kind of like nice and warm and comfy. And then you add on that little
[01:17:07.790 --> 01:17:15.150]  raciness of the early harvest and it's a, and it is a really nice combination. I don't know how the
[01:17:15.150 --> 01:17:19.550]  light balances in here. I kind of turned one of them off, but yeah, they're just reaching the
[01:17:19.550 --> 01:17:24.350]  screen right now. I've got several Finos of the Mac V2 back there. And I'm loving this one in the
[01:17:24.350 --> 01:17:30.830]  corner. Cause it's a nut, just tons and tons of tops. And then going to some daddy Mac over here
[01:17:30.830 --> 01:17:35.470]  from in-house they're much more, they're just kind of coming out of a reveg. These are all coming out
[01:17:35.470 --> 01:17:41.470]  of a reveg by the way. So yeah, it's a cool little garden, man. I've got a lot of cover crop and
[01:17:42.110 --> 01:17:47.150]  wheat rye grass and all kinds of stuff. Avocado tech logs down there. I'm not sure if you can
[01:17:47.150 --> 01:17:53.790]  see, but yeah, it's like a little terrarium. And did you flip them to sex them? And then is that
[01:17:53.790 --> 01:17:58.110]  why you're reveging them? No, no. These are came from cuts from out in the greenhouse.
[01:18:00.590 --> 01:18:04.670]  And then I was holding them and I thought they started to get a little punky. Like they still
[01:18:04.670 --> 01:18:09.870]  wanted to flower. And so I had to just nurse them back and revege them. So they're doing really nice
[01:18:09.870 --> 01:18:16.750]  for, you know, that considered. And yeah, they'll go up into the fluence eventually. And I timed this,
[01:18:16.990 --> 01:18:21.870]  I grow kind of in a weird sense because I'm, I have a height restriction right in this particular
[01:18:21.870 --> 01:18:27.870]  tent and I'll grow them right, right. I won't move. I'll leave the light static and I'll grow
[01:18:27.870 --> 01:18:31.710]  them right up into them. And I just, it's all about timing. You have to time them perfectly to
[01:18:32.350 --> 01:18:36.350]  veg them just the right amount and then guess how much they're going to flower and put them right up
[01:18:36.350 --> 01:18:40.590]  into those lights for the, for the end. And then I use my dimmers in the end to kind of back it off.
[01:18:40.590 --> 01:18:46.670]  And it seems to work really nice, but yeah, my little home, grow my little home tent.
[01:18:46.670 --> 01:18:52.030]  It's a fun little experiment, but yeah, I don't know if I can flip any pods for you right now.
[01:18:52.030 --> 01:19:04.190]  They're kind of new and gooey. Yeah. Jungle in here. I'm not going to get the right lighting.
[01:19:04.270 --> 01:19:09.630]  I don't think, wow, this is kind of cool actually. Covered with a fungal.
[01:19:11.390 --> 01:19:17.470]  We're getting about every 50th frame. Yeah. That's no good. I thought that was just me.
[01:19:18.990 --> 01:19:22.270]  Just, yeah, I can't look at the camera at the same time on this little thing.
[01:19:24.670 --> 01:19:28.190]  Anyway, looks good though, man. Cool little garden.
[01:19:28.190 --> 01:19:36.750]  Well, so it's interesting because someone asked Joda if you train or, or, you know, trellis or
[01:19:36.750 --> 01:19:42.190]  anything and Blue, you do. Yeah. I'm not big on trellising because of the rotation. It makes it
[01:19:42.190 --> 01:19:46.430]  difficult, right? You can't move plants around. You can't turn them. You can't pull them in and
[01:19:46.430 --> 01:19:50.990]  out if you're a trellis, right? They're kind of stuck in place once you put that trellis in.
[01:19:51.790 --> 01:19:57.470]  So I don't tend to do that. I do use the Atlas plant trainer to do some LST. I prefer LST.
[01:19:58.510 --> 01:20:03.550]  Low stress training. Occasionally I will super crop or top a plant if I have to, if they get too
[01:20:03.550 --> 01:20:10.670]  tall. But in general, I usually like to just let them go. I like the natural expression of the
[01:20:10.670 --> 01:20:17.870]  plant. I like to let them let, let them grow out. I don't focus on yield. I get a lot of,
[01:20:17.870 --> 01:20:22.110]  that's a question I get a lot. How much do your plants yield on average? But I don't know.
[01:20:22.110 --> 01:20:30.350]  I don't weigh my final results. I don't care. As long as I have cannabis to smoke, I'm happy.
[01:20:30.350 --> 01:20:37.470]  And so it really, it doesn't make a difference. And I, so I couldn't tell you how much each plant
[01:20:37.470 --> 01:20:42.430]  yields or what my average yields are. If my yields have gone up or gone down since I went to natural
[01:20:42.430 --> 01:20:47.550]  versus non-natural, I just don't care about weight. I grow more than I can smoke. And as long
[01:20:47.550 --> 01:20:53.230]  as I grow more than I can smoke, that's all I need. And so yield isn't necessarily something I
[01:20:53.230 --> 01:21:00.110]  focus on. I use training primarily to deal with height limitation issues, right? That's when I
[01:21:00.110 --> 01:21:05.710]  have to do training because the plants get too tall for the limit of my, of height in my basement.
[01:21:09.090 --> 01:21:13.490]  Same here. That's what I, it's definitely a height restriction issue, but I have gotten
[01:21:13.490 --> 01:21:17.250]  into a little bit of the molding of the plants and you know, like you said, you have a plant
[01:21:17.330 --> 01:21:25.010]  trainer, so you must be into it a little bit too. And it's fun. It's absolutely fun to do some
[01:21:25.010 --> 01:21:35.250]  training sometimes. And when you do training, right, you do mess and affect the, what is it,
[01:21:35.250 --> 01:21:41.650]  the auxins and the secatins in the roots. And I think when you do low stress training and you
[01:21:41.650 --> 01:21:48.210]  train plants over that does force some root growth and vice versa. So there's some give and
[01:21:48.210 --> 01:21:53.970]  take within the plant itself. When you do those things, I'm not as big of a fan of topping for
[01:21:53.970 --> 01:21:59.330]  that reason as well, because I think you remove energy from the plant that isn't necessary. And
[01:21:59.330 --> 01:22:04.850]  then it takes time for those plants to rebuild up the proper amount of hormones or auxins in those
[01:22:04.850 --> 01:22:09.650]  tops to make sure that you do get some good tops. So I'm not as much of a fan of training for that
[01:22:09.650 --> 01:22:17.890]  reason. I also don't do a ton of heavy defoliation most of the time. Defoliation is usually to,
[01:22:18.770 --> 01:22:25.890]  again, to help allow light through the canopy or to remove leaves that are just not as healthy,
[01:22:26.450 --> 01:22:31.010]  but I'm not like, I don't go through every one of the plants and strip everything except for the
[01:22:31.010 --> 01:22:38.770]  top three or five nodes. And I don't, again, try not to move too much energy from the plant because
[01:22:38.770 --> 01:22:46.210]  when you do that heavy of a strip on the plant, the plant has to spend time healing itself.
[01:22:46.210 --> 01:22:53.970]  And that is energy you're taking away from it developing THC and cannabinoids and bud
[01:22:53.970 --> 01:23:03.010]  structures themselves. So there is definitely, I believe in training. I do believe in some stripping,
[01:23:03.010 --> 01:23:07.570]  but I think you do need to be careful with stripping too much because you are going to affect
[01:23:08.770 --> 01:23:12.530]  how much energy that plant has and they will have to spend some time healing themselves.
[01:23:17.710 --> 01:23:22.990]  Yeah, I moved away from the trellis this round just because scouting and anything in the middle
[01:23:22.990 --> 01:23:27.550]  of the room is a shit show when it's all trellised up. But I think, yeah, shooting for yield, you need
[01:23:27.550 --> 01:23:32.190]  to throw a trellis up. You need to be bending them around. But I'm just doing selection and,
[01:23:32.190 --> 01:23:36.430]  like you said, I already grow more than I can smoke. So I'd rather just kind of just tie them
[01:23:36.430 --> 01:23:41.150]  up as needed and not have the whole room headed off. You know, yeah, just makes it easier.
[01:23:42.750 --> 01:23:43.250]  Yeah.
[01:23:45.790 --> 01:23:50.430]  Obviously, if you're running a commercial facility like our friend Brandon, then your yield is
[01:23:50.430 --> 01:23:54.990]  important because you're trying to maximize your efficiencies and your square footage and there's
[01:23:54.990 --> 01:24:00.030]  costs involved and all those things. But as a home grower, as long as you can grow enough cannabis to
[01:24:00.030 --> 01:24:05.390]  keep your supply happy and hopefully your friends and your family as well, then, you know, I think
[01:24:05.390 --> 01:24:12.510]  that trellising and training and things can really be personal in your own personal choice,
[01:24:12.510 --> 01:24:16.510]  what you like doing and how you like the plant. Again, I like to stay away from the trellising
[01:24:16.510 --> 01:24:21.550]  because I like to move the plants around the tent. And because all my plants have a different
[01:24:22.190 --> 01:24:28.270]  level or age, it doesn't necessarily make sense in my scenario.
[01:24:29.230 --> 01:24:33.390]  You know, I hate trellis as well. And from a commercial standpoint, it's just,
[01:24:34.030 --> 01:24:41.230]  it's such a fucking headache having to deal with it. But it's a necessary evil.
[01:24:41.790 --> 01:24:48.270]  Yep. Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, you can see this is my first round going without it and everything
[01:24:48.270 --> 01:24:54.270]  is like to the roof pretty much. It's out of hand. I mean, I've started tying stuff down, but
[01:24:55.230 --> 01:24:58.030]  I mean, as far as like scouting to the middle of the room, though,
[01:24:58.030 --> 01:25:02.030]  it just makes things like that easier. I don't know. It's all experimental.
[01:25:04.270 --> 01:25:08.350]  I will pull my plants out of the tent and clean the bottom of the tent.
[01:25:08.350 --> 01:25:10.350]  Again, can't do that when everything's trellised.
[01:25:13.150 --> 01:25:18.030]  I got a bunch of pots here. This is where the next seedlings are going. I'm just figuring out
[01:25:18.030 --> 01:25:25.710]  where all 17 are going. Yep. But this is round three for this soil now. Oh, nice. What size pots
[01:25:25.710 --> 01:25:31.390]  are those? These are 20 gallons. And this is like a, I got this at a local nursery. It's just like
[01:25:31.390 --> 01:25:35.470]  this triple, I don't even know what it is. Literally everything in this room is in need
[01:25:35.470 --> 01:25:40.990]  of an upgrade. This is as low budget as it gets. But I mean, it's clearly doing the trick.
[01:25:40.990 --> 01:25:44.910]  It's a slow progress. I've been very fortunate. This is my little.
[01:25:45.790 --> 01:25:51.630]  I have some amazing gear that people have given me, but I started very small as well. You have
[01:25:51.630 --> 01:25:55.070]  to slowly build over time. I think it's another thing. People shouldn't go out and spend a ton
[01:25:55.070 --> 01:26:02.270]  of money to get started. Look at the mushrooms going. Yeah, I threw some logs down. It was sort
[01:26:02.270 --> 01:26:08.990]  of inspired by Blue's avocado tech. Theo, can you flip your phone 90 degrees like a TV?
[01:26:09.230 --> 01:26:14.430]  Yeah, my bad. Look at that. Absolutely. Full screen. Yeah. And yeah, so last round,
[01:26:14.430 --> 01:26:20.110]  the pill bugs got way out of hand. And my first thought with the log was to give them something
[01:26:20.110 --> 01:26:25.870]  to do. And it seems to be working, but it's also like, I don't know when there's that many worms
[01:26:25.870 --> 01:26:30.430]  and bugs, it's hard to develop a little mycelium mat up top because it's kind of constantly getting
[01:26:30.430 --> 01:26:34.510]  tilled. So there's like every time I checked down there, there's a little bit of mycelium coming in.
[01:26:34.670 --> 01:26:39.390]  So I think it's just a different little microclimate. You can see in all these pots,
[01:26:39.390 --> 01:26:45.950]  I got log there, log there. That one fruited some turkey tails. Just another experimental
[01:26:45.950 --> 01:26:51.870]  little thing. Yeah, I like that. I think it follows that principle of having something that's
[01:26:52.430 --> 01:26:56.430]  kind of static in your system that will continue to inoculate your system just by being there.
[01:26:57.230 --> 01:27:04.430]  Yeah. I'm a fan of hot spots too. You do that with the avocado tech sort of.
[01:27:04.670 --> 01:27:08.030]  You wouldn't want to have avocados in your whole bed, but it's good to have little hot spots of
[01:27:08.030 --> 01:27:16.190]  worms. You can see some worms hanging out where that pot was. But yeah, just creating little
[01:27:16.190 --> 01:27:20.350]  microclimate. It's like this is a different little, I can lift this one and see what it looks like.
[01:27:22.670 --> 01:27:27.790]  It's actually not too much mycelium or anything, but yeah.
[01:27:29.230 --> 01:27:33.710]  Retains moisture though. And like you said, it gives a place for critters to live and breed.
[01:27:34.350 --> 01:27:38.590]  Yeah. I thought what it was like, you go outside and you lift up a log and there's
[01:27:38.590 --> 01:27:42.030]  like a whole little community down there. So I kind of wanted to create that.
[01:27:42.910 --> 01:27:48.830]  Yeah. It depends as far as you're so vibrant with a arthropod community or any insect community.
[01:27:48.830 --> 01:27:51.630]  It's a good indicator that there's good things going on in your soil.
[01:27:51.630 --> 01:27:51.870]  Yeah.
[01:27:52.910 --> 01:27:53.470]  Micro-web.
[01:27:55.150 --> 01:28:02.830]  That's a Jelly Breath S1 from in-house. I got the S1 because a buddy of mine wanted to grow ferns
[01:28:02.830 --> 01:28:08.430]  and I split a pack with him. And I'm pleasantly surprised with what I'm getting from it for sure.
[01:28:12.110 --> 01:28:19.310]  And are all... So Blue, we saw your tent, we saw Jodo, we saw Theo's. Are all of you hand watering
[01:28:19.310 --> 01:28:22.750]  or what's your watering kind of set up and regimen?
[01:28:22.750 --> 01:28:23.870]  I'm all hand water.
[01:28:25.310 --> 01:28:30.750]  I do hand water. I've used the Blue Mat system a little bit and I'll probably move back to the
[01:28:30.750 --> 01:28:36.830]  Blue Mat when I go back to beds. I do like the Blue Mat system for some of the automated
[01:28:36.830 --> 01:28:43.150]  watering, especially in veg, but everything's hand water for me.
[01:28:44.350 --> 01:28:48.670]  And then are you using like... Do you have well water in a central mass or...
[01:28:48.670 --> 01:28:55.950]  So I'm using... So I use tap water and I do two different treatments to make sure that I'm
[01:28:55.950 --> 01:29:05.230]  handling both chlorine and chloramine. So basically I have a couple of big water gallon
[01:29:05.230 --> 01:29:12.030]  buckets and I run bubblers in there to oxygenate the water for at least 24 hours before I use it,
[01:29:12.030 --> 01:29:18.750]  which is going to get rid of any chlorine. And then I use humic acid because humic acid will
[01:29:18.910 --> 01:29:25.630]  counteract chloramine. So it will actually chelate and bind chloramine so that it's inert.
[01:29:25.630 --> 01:29:35.470]  And so if you take the time to oxygenate and then use the humic acid, you can deal with any
[01:29:35.470 --> 01:29:43.060]  chlorine or chloramine that might be in your water. Do you have a fan that just kicked in?
[01:29:44.580 --> 01:29:48.900]  Yeah. Yeah. Sorry about that. Let me see if I can shut that thing off. Hold on one second.
[01:29:48.900 --> 01:29:54.260]  Whose audio is that? Any left? There he goes.
[01:29:54.260 --> 01:29:57.860]  Boom out all day long over here. I love it. Absolutely love it.
[01:29:58.580 --> 01:30:03.460]  And then the water... But what about the water itself? Are you treating it or is it just the
[01:30:04.740 --> 01:30:10.100]  main spring water that I envision? Yeah. I'm blessed to live on an island and
[01:30:11.300 --> 01:30:16.980]  out on that island, there's some pretty good aquifers below it. So we... It's municipal
[01:30:16.980 --> 01:30:22.260]  water, though. It's drawn from a reservoir on one of our lakes on the island. And I always just...
[01:30:22.260 --> 01:30:27.140]  They treat it mostly with... I talked to the guy at the water company. He actually said he's moved
[01:30:27.140 --> 01:30:33.620]  away from a lot of chlorine or considering chloramine, which they're not, thank goodness,
[01:30:34.260 --> 01:30:39.460]  adding to our system. But he's using a lot of H2O2, I guess he said. So I thought that was
[01:30:39.460 --> 01:30:45.380]  interesting. And my water's good. I always gas it off, though, for a while. I leave it in a larger
[01:30:45.380 --> 01:30:52.340]  reservoir anyway that has a bubbler in it. And yeah, it seems to be good water for my system.
[01:30:52.340 --> 01:30:58.580]  Don't have any issues, I don't think. But yeah, the blue mats... One thing I wanted to say about
[01:30:58.580 --> 01:31:04.260]  the blue mats and that watering aspect is that I was talking about this a couple nights ago, that
[01:31:04.820 --> 01:31:09.860]  I feel like there's this unseen connection that develops eventually with the mycelium in your
[01:31:09.860 --> 01:31:15.700]  system and the blue mat and the way it connects with the plant. And it's able to just become this...
[01:31:16.260 --> 01:31:19.940]  I don't know. I just think it's a little bit of a more special connection than just a standard
[01:31:19.940 --> 01:31:25.620]  watering method. Because I feel this relationship of the plant... It's sort of like the exude
[01:31:25.620 --> 01:31:30.580]  exchange situation. It's the same thing, a water exchange relationship kind of has developed that
[01:31:30.580 --> 01:31:37.940]  I think is really special and has improved my game. So... I definitely noticed a much
[01:31:37.940 --> 01:31:42.500]  more developed root base with the blue mats when I was using them in veg.
[01:31:44.660 --> 01:31:49.700]  Allowing... Again, I think that's a more natural approach, right? I think when we
[01:31:50.580 --> 01:31:57.940]  water or we use a system, we're watering based on our scheduling. And when we think the plant needs
[01:31:57.940 --> 01:32:02.740]  water, when you use the blue mat, you're just letting it drink whenever it wants, right? So,
[01:32:02.740 --> 01:32:08.020]  similar to we're providing that biome and that place for the nutrients where the plant can just
[01:32:08.020 --> 01:32:12.100]  take what it needs when it needs it. It's the same thing with the blue mats. It's allowing that
[01:32:12.100 --> 01:32:16.340]  moisture to be there when it needs it. And the plant can decide what it wants to drink and how
[01:32:16.340 --> 01:32:23.300]  much it wants to drink and when. Yeah, I think that's the unseen connection that is the...
[01:32:23.300 --> 01:32:26.420]  that people don't necessarily take into consideration with blue mats. I understand
[01:32:26.420 --> 01:32:31.460]  all the logistic things about it. But like I said, I think there's this relationship forms
[01:32:31.460 --> 01:32:37.700]  with the biology that is you can't replicate with another style, even irrigation, I think.
[01:32:37.700 --> 01:32:43.540]  When you water, you create weather. You're God, being God and creating weather for your plant,
[01:32:43.540 --> 01:32:49.060]  creating a situation for it that it has to deal with. Whereas with the blue mat, it's kind of
[01:32:49.060 --> 01:32:55.060]  like always there. It's just interacting with it. It's just a different mechanism in my opinion. And
[01:32:55.060 --> 01:33:04.500]  then maybe the biology is dictating that. So just quickly a while ago, KSG had the
[01:33:05.060 --> 01:33:09.860]  roly poly sweet potato tip. And that got me thinking. A couple of people have asked if
[01:33:09.860 --> 01:33:17.300]  you can just quickly say what exactly avocado tech is. Sure. And then just quickly with roly
[01:33:17.300 --> 01:33:22.420]  poly, it seems like if they have other food sources, they're amazing. But if they run out
[01:33:22.420 --> 01:33:25.940]  of other food sources, they start eating your plants, right? Is that kind of the issue?
[01:33:26.900 --> 01:33:33.060]  Yeah, definitely. I've been lucky to not introduce them into my system and instead have millipedes.
[01:33:33.060 --> 01:33:38.660]  And the millipedes are much more benevolent in the system, in my opinion. They don't seem to
[01:33:38.660 --> 01:33:45.140]  chew on any plants when they get frustrated. But again, I have ample organic matter and ample
[01:33:45.140 --> 01:33:50.500]  them to chew on. I put logs in as well that I had inoculated with mycelium and I put them kind of
[01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:59.380]  on the edges of the beds. And they'll feed on those logs if need be, if times get tough. So
[01:34:01.620 --> 01:34:05.860]  they're a better complement than the roly polys, I think. The roly polys, once they kind of run
[01:34:05.860 --> 01:34:09.700]  out of steam, and I don't even know if it's that, I think that they explore and they feed
[01:34:09.700 --> 01:34:14.980]  and they can definitely become an issue in your system. All right. And a quick avocado tech
[01:34:14.980 --> 01:34:21.220]  overview. Yep. So basically what I do is I use the avocado. I cut it in half. I like it to be
[01:34:21.220 --> 01:34:26.420]  very ripe. If not, slightly rotten. Remove the seed, although there are some methods where you
[01:34:26.420 --> 01:34:30.740]  can puree the seed and re-add it to the avocado. But you're essentially making a guacamole,
[01:34:30.740 --> 01:34:35.860]  putting it back into the half shell and then putting it face down on your soil. It acts as
[01:34:35.860 --> 01:34:42.100]  a humidity dome or natural mulch and the micro life just flocks to it like crazy. And then I've
[01:34:42.100 --> 01:34:47.860]  taken it a step further with my own growing here. And it's kind of my test garden. And what I will
[01:34:47.860 --> 01:34:56.420]  do is add specific amendments at specific times, specific types of biology, things like bokashi,
[01:34:56.420 --> 01:35:01.060]  barley, sky's the limit. You can use a very, you know, grocery store approach to go find something
[01:35:01.060 --> 01:35:07.060]  that is high in that particular target you're looking for and incorporate it into the guacamole,
[01:35:07.060 --> 01:35:10.340]  sneak it by the goalie, have the worms dive through it, arthropods eat it,
[01:35:11.300 --> 01:35:17.620]  and just make the system happier. And it acts as a little micro hub in your soil to help perpetuate
[01:35:17.620 --> 01:35:23.620]  it. So it's got a lot of different cool, cool benefits, but it's very simple. I don't go
[01:35:23.620 --> 01:35:29.860]  overboard with anything. One half an avocado, plenty for one plant just to make a nice little,
[01:35:29.860 --> 01:35:34.980]  you know, nutrient spike or a little hub near your plant. And it's a cool little system.
[01:35:34.980 --> 01:35:37.460]  And you only do it three times per cycle, right?
[01:35:38.020 --> 01:35:43.540]  Yeah, it's very minimalist. I want to stress to people, if you want to try it out, just use a
[01:35:43.540 --> 01:35:49.140]  plain avocado. Don't go overboard and add the whole kitchen sink in it. Try it, learn it,
[01:35:49.140 --> 01:35:55.380]  see how it affects your system. Go light, test if you can, test your soil before, after, look at the
[01:35:55.380 --> 01:36:01.620]  real results. And yeah, it's beautiful. It's a beautiful thing. And I just do one starter pod or
[01:36:01.940 --> 01:36:08.100]  pod. Then I move on to a, about two weeks before I'm thinking about flipping into flower, I'll put
[01:36:08.100 --> 01:36:14.580]  down a phosphorus aimed pod, maintain calcium through that pod, maintain biology through that
[01:36:14.580 --> 01:36:20.580]  pod. And then around day 21, people like to do leaf strips and like to kind of, you know, mess
[01:36:20.580 --> 01:36:24.980]  with the plant at that point. I think that's a popular thing to do. And I'll clean up my plants
[01:36:24.980 --> 01:36:28.580]  around then. I don't do full strips or anything like that, but that's around the time when I
[01:36:28.580 --> 01:36:34.020]  clean up, I'll put that down at the end and that will be a potassium focused one. That will be,
[01:36:35.620 --> 01:36:40.340]  that will be mainly, mainly potassium is what I'm looking for in that. But I also add sort of,
[01:36:40.340 --> 01:36:46.020]  that's when I add my sort of, I don't know, more sugar rich inputs that tend to have some good.
[01:36:46.020 --> 01:36:48.500]  Sweetener. Got to get that advanced ripening phase.
[01:36:48.500 --> 01:36:53.300]  Yeah. And so it's all for ripening. And so I'll create a little, little biology explosion around
[01:36:53.300 --> 01:36:57.780]  then. It seems to carry them on through then the flower, but that's it. Three half avocados per
[01:36:57.780 --> 01:37:06.820]  plant per cycle. But for, yeah, just use the plain avocado. It's a great little fun experiment
[01:37:06.820 --> 01:37:11.460]  and it's very risk-free. I mean, I tell a lot of growers, if you're looking towards going organic,
[01:37:11.460 --> 01:37:17.780]  the first two things you can do is in my opinion, is employ a reasonable cover crop and add avocado
[01:37:17.780 --> 01:37:23.380]  tech and you'll see better water retention. You'll see better, you know, overall soil moisture.
[01:37:24.020 --> 01:37:28.580]  You'll just, you'll see, you'll see improvements. Hands down.
[01:37:30.500 --> 01:37:36.660]  Going back to the, the pill bugs or the roly polies, they didn't become a problem until my
[01:37:36.660 --> 01:37:42.740]  soil started drying out. Like I checked the soil after the round and the whole inside of the pot
[01:37:42.740 --> 01:37:48.260]  was just bone dry and their population was getting real high. So I think they just kind of migrate
[01:37:48.260 --> 01:37:53.700]  out of the soil. Once they start getting creative, once their population gets high and then like half
[01:37:53.700 --> 01:37:58.260]  the soil dries out and they just start, I mean, they were eating the lower nugs on my plants.
[01:37:58.260 --> 01:38:05.460]  They were out of hand and you know, Steensland says, wait for the spiders, which is the best
[01:38:05.460 --> 01:38:11.700]  method. I got spiders fucking everywhere in here now. But yeah, from now on I'm taking that as a
[01:38:11.700 --> 01:38:18.020]  sign that my soil, that I got a dry pocket going if they start climbing up on the plants because
[01:38:18.740 --> 01:38:23.700]  I've been watering a lot more this round and I don't see them. That and the log thing, I don't
[01:38:23.700 --> 01:38:28.180]  see them up on the plants at all. Yeah, I had them real bad. It's like that everywhere. I mean, you
[01:38:28.180 --> 01:38:33.300]  leave like a piece of wood outside where I'm at and they'll just be roly polies under it five minutes
[01:38:33.300 --> 01:38:39.460]  later. So that's just something I got to deal with. But I had a weird anomaly recently too,
[01:38:39.460 --> 01:38:45.540]  the last round where I had a mold mite explosion. And then for all of you who know what mold mites
[01:38:45.540 --> 01:38:51.140]  are, they are a lot of times used in the carrier when you purchase predatory mites as sort of like
[01:38:51.140 --> 01:38:55.540]  feeder stock. And so you'll get a few in your system, but chances are if you're growing in
[01:38:55.540 --> 01:39:02.100]  any kind of soil, they're present. And I had just this prolific explosion of them to where
[01:39:02.100 --> 01:39:06.820]  all over the outside of the tent, everywhere. I mean like millions, millions, millions of these
[01:39:06.820 --> 01:39:09.940]  things. And for my videos, they were awesome. They were crawling all over everything.
[01:39:09.940 --> 01:39:15.380]  They were awesome. Yeah. If you get that, that's a good time to throw the like the hypolasps or
[01:39:15.380 --> 01:39:19.780]  the rove beetles in there. Cause that's just like straight bait for them. Cause I put the
[01:39:19.780 --> 01:39:23.140]  rove beetles in before and they hang around for like a week and there's just really nothing for
[01:39:23.140 --> 01:39:26.980]  them to do. But you got to have the mold mites or something there. You got to be at that point
[01:39:26.980 --> 01:39:31.700]  in succession to put them in. I mean, it's a good thing that you have a lot of organic matter in your
[01:39:31.700 --> 01:39:36.900]  soil basically is what it is. But it got to the point where they were almost pest pressure. And
[01:39:36.900 --> 01:39:40.660]  I don't even consider a mold mite a pest. I mean, I have people send me DMs all the time. What is
[01:39:40.660 --> 01:39:48.180]  this thing? And generally it's a clear ish white, small mites that has the defining factors are
[01:39:48.180 --> 01:39:52.260]  generally, it has these spiky hair protrusions looking a little bit like Sonic the Hedgehog
[01:39:52.260 --> 01:39:57.620]  or a porcupine. And that's how you can tell the difference between Stradios or other, you know,
[01:39:57.620 --> 01:40:04.020]  other small soil borne insects. These guys were, they were definitely chewing on my plants,
[01:40:04.020 --> 01:40:08.580]  but they're extremely easy to get rid of. And I actually just let the system, like he said,
[01:40:08.580 --> 01:40:12.260]  wait for the spiders to come. I just let the system take care of it. And then what happened
[01:40:12.260 --> 01:40:18.580]  is I had a Stradio, Simitus, explosion, and they just basically took them all out. And
[01:40:20.740 --> 01:40:24.020]  normal population. But I thought it was interesting that there was just this like
[01:40:24.020 --> 01:40:28.820]  boom and bust cycle going on in there. It got me thinking about chitin and the chitinase
[01:40:29.540 --> 01:40:36.980]  cycle in my soil and seeing them kind of like have all this ample material to produce all these
[01:40:36.980 --> 01:40:43.380]  organisms in my system. And then this like slow succession of die offs. And it's a really good
[01:40:43.380 --> 01:40:48.340]  sign to me. It means that like natural processes are living and breathing in my little, in my
[01:40:48.340 --> 01:40:53.540]  little milk, which is, you know, just a great time. Yeah. And that'll happen early succession
[01:40:53.540 --> 01:40:57.780]  where like you just set up an ecosystem. There's going to be some huge explosions of certain things
[01:40:57.780 --> 01:41:04.180]  and huge die offs until it really starts balancing out. So I like bringing in something like leaf
[01:41:04.180 --> 01:41:08.180]  mold or some really old something from the forest that's like already deep succession. It's got the
[01:41:08.180 --> 01:41:13.300]  nematodes and everything. You kind of skip some of that initial like fungus gnat explosion and
[01:41:13.300 --> 01:41:18.420]  then mold mite explosion. Kind of like jump your way up into succession a little bit.
[01:41:19.620 --> 01:41:23.540]  That early succession is when you can see like pill bugs get way fucking out of hand.
[01:41:23.540 --> 01:41:27.220]  You get fungus gnats like crazy. Yeah.
[01:41:27.940 --> 01:41:36.020]  So this, we had some questions and this, anyone can take this, but that was,
[01:41:37.140 --> 01:41:42.500]  because you had mentioned that. Yeah, I buy bio ag. I buy it from a company called BioAg.
[01:41:42.500 --> 01:41:48.900]  They make a good humic, organic humic acid source. They sell both humic and fulvic acid.
[01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:58.200]  But you can also, my understanding is you can make your own humic acid by running water through
[01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:06.920]  good compost. If you have a compost pile, the compost is humus. And if you run water through
[01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:14.120]  that humus, you will actually create your own humic acid. So that is, you can actually make
[01:42:14.120 --> 01:42:25.000]  your own humic acid at home if you have a good compost pile. Yeah, but speaking on the humic
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:30.840]  source, the guy from BioAg, Dr. Foust is doing all that work. It makes me really not trust a lot
[01:42:30.840 --> 01:42:35.560]  of these companies, humic sources to where his work showing like you mine in one spot and it's
[01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:40.520]  like, it's some black gold for the plants and then like five feet over and it's detrimental for the
[01:42:40.520 --> 01:42:44.920]  plants. Absolutely. And he's the only person I know that's doing that work. So as far as the
[01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:50.680]  mined humic substances, I would only go with BioAg. Other than that, you should make a nice
[01:42:51.560 --> 01:42:59.240]  vermicompost or something. Yep. I was pleasantly surprised to find that out after the fact,
[01:42:59.240 --> 01:43:04.520]  because I was actually already using their product, how much he does get involved in the creation of
[01:43:04.520 --> 01:43:09.560]  that product, which is great. Yeah. I recommend anybody to go. He has a few podcasts. I forget
[01:43:09.560 --> 01:43:15.320]  who's on. I think John Kempfer. He's on a few, but it's good to hear that dude talk. He really-
[01:43:15.320 --> 01:43:17.560]  It might've been Tad Hussey. He might've been on the Kisser.
[01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:23.400]  Yeah. Yeah. I think you're right. Yeah. But yeah, anyway, I recommend everybody go listen to him.
[01:43:24.360 --> 01:43:29.320]  Or maybe Peter do your thing. Get him on an episode.
[01:43:29.320 --> 01:43:34.360]  I'll try to bring him on. Another question was about rock dust.
[01:43:36.280 --> 01:43:44.760]  So yeah, I mean, I'm not incorporating any rock dust personally yet, but I will be when I start
[01:43:44.760 --> 01:43:50.200]  making some soil in the spring. And there's actually, there's a local, back to the Massachusetts
[01:43:50.200 --> 01:43:56.760]  connection, right? There's a local company that's making rock dust locally that I'm going to get it
[01:43:56.760 --> 01:43:59.960]  from. Most of the stuff that I'm- Like Planet? Or what is it?
[01:44:01.480 --> 01:44:04.840]  Not quite sure. That's the name of the company. It's called Rock Dust. They're actually selling
[01:44:04.840 --> 01:44:11.400]  it at some of the local hydro stores as well. But I've been, that's the other thing is as I've
[01:44:11.400 --> 01:44:20.120]  shifted from traditional growing to this more organic method, most of the stuff I get is either
[01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:24.600]  from the grocery store or the feed store, right? I don't go to the grocery store to buy inputs
[01:44:24.600 --> 01:44:31.960]  anymore. I go to the feed store or I go to the supermarket. Supermarket is not the best place
[01:44:31.960 --> 01:44:38.680]  to get your stuff for FPJs and FFJs and things like that. I prefer to use farm stands and my
[01:44:38.680 --> 01:44:42.920]  CSA in the summer and things like that. But in general, that's usually what I'm doing is I'm
[01:44:42.920 --> 01:44:49.240]  going and I'm buying sugar and vinegar at the supermarket. And then I'm getting inputs from
[01:44:49.800 --> 01:44:56.760]  either the feed store or my buddy locally at Buxton Hollow Farms. He has good locally sourced
[01:44:57.480 --> 01:45:08.200]  access to things like calcinated algae and good rice brand and things like that. So organic
[01:45:08.200 --> 01:45:15.000]  barleys. And so I encourage people to look locally and look at your feed stores. Look at your
[01:45:16.680 --> 01:45:23.240]  local farm stands and things as a place to get your inputs as opposed to going to the grocery
[01:45:23.240 --> 01:45:29.080]  store. And I think Blue mentioned some great ways to get started. I think another great way to get
[01:45:29.080 --> 01:45:33.160]  started if you're trying to make your own inputs is really one of the best ways is just make lab.
[01:45:34.120 --> 01:45:41.960]  Making your own lactic acid bacteria is super easy. Almost everybody has rice at their house.
[01:45:42.920 --> 01:45:47.320]  So it's super easy to make rice water and then some milk and some rice water and you can make
[01:45:47.320 --> 01:45:54.920]  your own lab. And that lactic acid bacteria is tremendous. It's a great easy additive.
[01:45:55.720 --> 01:46:02.920]  It helps combat certain types of problems in your soil and certain types of molds and funguses.
[01:46:03.080 --> 01:46:08.360]  And it's just it's a great input for your plant. Super easy to make and it's a great way to get
[01:46:08.360 --> 01:46:15.880]  going. FPJs and FFJs are also super easy to make. Fruit and sugar. You mix them. You let them sit
[01:46:15.880 --> 01:46:21.960]  for seven to ten days and then you strain them and you've got an input. Again, super easy to get going.
[01:46:22.520 --> 01:46:30.360]  Doesn't take a lot of effort and a lot of time. Some of the other things like OHN and IMO.
[01:46:31.080 --> 01:46:35.880]  Those take a little bit more time. Those take a little bit more effort and care. But it is very
[01:46:35.880 --> 01:46:42.680]  easy to get going. It is easy to start a worm bin. To go on to Uncle Jim's worm farm. Go buy yourself
[01:46:42.680 --> 01:46:50.600]  500 or 100 worm red wrigglers and put them in a bucket with some cocoa and feed them food scraps
[01:46:50.600 --> 01:46:58.680]  so that you're not throwing as much waste away. Shredded paper and cardboard and food scraps,
[01:46:58.680 --> 01:47:05.480]  coffee grounds, tea, banana peels, things like that. There's all sorts of different ways that
[01:47:05.480 --> 01:47:15.560]  you can start doing things more regeneratively, more mindful of the environment. Looking for
[01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:23.880]  ways to reduce waste. Looking for ways that you can take your everyday wastes and move them back
[01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:27.160]  into your garden so that you can help benefit your plants.
[01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:37.400]  Well, it's funny. I was going to make some WCA and then Scott Scams talked about how you're not
[01:47:37.400 --> 01:47:44.200]  quite sure how much calcium I guess the eggshells have. But do you guys all make WCA?
[01:47:44.200 --> 01:47:46.200]  I absolutely do. I absolutely do.
[01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:48.040]  Blue's a no.
[01:47:48.440 --> 01:47:53.560]  I haven't in a while. I was just going to say, I'm going to do it now. I got my own chickens at home
[01:47:53.560 --> 01:47:57.800]  and I'm going to use those eggshells because I think you're totally right. Maybe some grocery
[01:47:57.800 --> 01:48:02.920]  store eggs, they might not be super high in calcium. You might even be getting some kind of
[01:48:02.920 --> 01:48:06.360]  funky sterilization shit that they use on the shelves.
[01:48:07.880 --> 01:48:13.800]  Interestingly enough, speaking of New England, they did a study a little while ago. It was a
[01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:18.600]  couple of years back where they actually did testing and they found that there were high
[01:48:18.600 --> 01:48:28.760]  amounts of arsenic and of lead in homegrown chicken eggs because of the things that are in
[01:48:28.760 --> 01:48:34.040]  our soil locally, especially the lead from all the paint from years and years that were used.
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:43.240]  I actually save all. I'm part of a CSA. I go to a farm all summer long to get my eggs.
[01:48:44.040 --> 01:48:49.160]  I save all the eggshells from the farm and those are what I use in my inputs.
[01:48:50.280 --> 01:48:56.200]  Even things like if I do go to the grocery store, I try to buy the organic bananas versus
[01:48:56.200 --> 01:49:02.280]  the commercial bananas because I want to make sure I'm using the better, less commercially
[01:49:02.280 --> 01:49:09.880]  developed inputs into my garden. You have to be careful if you're going to make your own inputs
[01:49:09.880 --> 01:49:16.600]  that the stuff you're putting in is good. There was a discussion, Blue was there, there was a
[01:49:16.600 --> 01:49:22.920]  discussion at the Regenerative Conference around neem, neem cake, neem oil, the neem plant.
[01:49:23.880 --> 01:49:33.320]  Neem itself can be a useful additive. The problem is that most neem comes from places that you can't
[01:49:33.320 --> 01:49:38.600]  actually see whether they're clean sourced or not. You have to be careful with what went into
[01:49:38.600 --> 01:49:45.640]  the neem plant because neem is a tremendous accumulator. Whatever was sprayed on that neem
[01:49:45.640 --> 01:49:53.480]  plant tree to grow it and then the oil that was extracted from it will have those things in it.
[01:49:53.480 --> 01:50:00.440]  And so if you get neem cake or neem oil from India or from some third world country or even from
[01:50:01.080 --> 01:50:05.880]  some agricultural company where you don't know how it was made and how it was sourced,
[01:50:05.880 --> 01:50:12.440]  you could be introducing bad things into your garden. Worms, you can't just go get worms from
[01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:19.640]  anywhere. Worms can introduce things into your garden that you didn't necessarily want. So you
[01:50:19.640 --> 01:50:23.720]  have to be careful where you get your worms. Everything that goes into your garden should
[01:50:23.720 --> 01:50:33.000]  be considered. And then Blue, you were shaking your head. So what are you using as a calcium source?
[01:50:33.480 --> 01:50:40.600]  I like gypsum. It's my go-to. I like how it improves the structure of my soil.
[01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:47.960]  I probably more accurately maintain it in a smaller container like, you know, 50 gallon container. I
[01:50:47.960 --> 01:50:54.440]  like how gypsum is slowly assimilated in there too. It's sometimes a little pokey for me. So I
[01:50:54.440 --> 01:51:00.040]  do keep a little bit of garden lime around in case I need to, you know, in case I need a little bump,
[01:51:00.120 --> 01:51:03.480]  you know, something's concerning me. But other than that, that's pretty much what I use. And
[01:51:03.480 --> 01:51:08.600]  then just returning all my stocks and all my leaf and everything to my soil. I have a very kind of,
[01:51:08.600 --> 01:51:12.600]  more of a closed loop because I'm returning a lot of those elements back into the, into the dirt.
[01:51:12.600 --> 01:51:18.120]  And my millipedes are eating them up. So it's a good, it's a good little cycle, I guess. I'm more,
[01:51:18.120 --> 01:51:23.080]  more focusing on just having it take care of itself in the cycle rather than me doctoring
[01:51:23.080 --> 01:51:27.000]  it all up. I just like to watch the plants and that's, should be my job.
[01:51:27.320 --> 01:51:34.360]  Yeah. I haven't been using the WCA much because, well, I know it's most effective when used as a
[01:51:34.360 --> 01:51:38.760]  foliar. And when you get to the point where you want to use it on a cannabis plant, you're beyond
[01:51:38.760 --> 01:51:43.480]  foliar feeding. So I almost just feel like when I'm drenching that in, not that it's a waste,
[01:51:43.480 --> 01:51:47.800]  it's, I don't know. I just spend my time on other things. It's like, I'm kind of at the point where
[01:51:47.800 --> 01:51:53.400]  I got the KNF inputs on my shelf and I use them when I need to, but I'm really, the worm bin is
[01:51:53.480 --> 01:52:00.200]  what I've been, is what I've really been leaning on. And I just, inspired by the coot method,
[01:52:00.200 --> 01:52:04.840]  I get some old, like four-year-old leaf mold, put a little bit of crab shell kelp in there,
[01:52:04.840 --> 01:52:11.320]  maybe a little bit of grain. I use the, the brand that comes in those insect sachets just to kind
[01:52:11.320 --> 01:52:16.440]  of kickstart the microbes. But I let that leaf mold kelp and crab shell sit for like six months.
[01:52:16.440 --> 01:52:21.480]  And that's all I've been feeding. And I tell you what, I've been feeding it for a year now.
[01:52:21.480 --> 01:52:25.880]  That's all I've been feeding. And I tell you what, I'm, I'm might not go back. I mean,
[01:52:25.880 --> 01:52:29.080]  I use the KNF to kind of like set up and inoculate soil, but
[01:52:30.280 --> 01:52:33.320]  I felt like with the weekly sprays, I was chasing my tail a little bit.
[01:52:34.760 --> 01:52:39.560]  Well, you know, part of the, as part of the nutritive cycle, WCA is not normally in there.
[01:52:39.560 --> 01:52:44.840]  WCA is one of those things that you kind of spray. It's not part of your maintenance solution. It's
[01:52:44.840 --> 01:52:49.880]  not part of the normal cycle. I think it's only in there in one phase. So.
[01:52:49.880 --> 01:52:51.240]  Yeah. At the very end.
[01:52:51.640 --> 01:52:54.920]  Yeah. And it's one of those things that you're adding more just to treat
[01:52:56.040 --> 01:53:04.120]  as opposed to the normal KNF nutritive cycle. You know, you do have your FPJ in there all the time.
[01:53:04.120 --> 01:53:12.520]  You have your vinegar in there all the time. You do have your, your even labs is not necessarily
[01:53:12.520 --> 01:53:21.400]  part of that normal set, right? Vinegar FPJ, your FAA during your vegetative cycle,
[01:53:21.400 --> 01:53:29.800]  and then you move into your WCAP. But even FFJs, I know a lot of people use FFJs.
[01:53:30.360 --> 01:53:36.280]  FFJs are only really for the enhanced ripening phase within the nutritive cycle and KNF,
[01:53:36.280 --> 01:53:37.400]  if you follow it strictly.
[01:53:38.280 --> 01:53:44.600]  Yeah. Yeah, totally. And yeah, with the WCA, it's like if you, if you're using,
[01:53:44.600 --> 01:53:49.880]  if you're spraying it on fruit trees or a tomato plant or something, and you're spraying it as a
[01:53:49.880 --> 01:53:54.280]  foliar, like late fruiting, that's when it's most effective. Cause the calcium is really,
[01:53:55.160 --> 01:54:00.120]  what's the word? Translaminar. I forget what the word is, but it's really effective as a foliar.
[01:54:01.080 --> 01:54:06.440]  And yeah, you're not going to be spraying WCA on a plant that's week six of flower.
[01:54:07.880 --> 01:54:13.400]  So I don't know. I, I got a bag of eggshells that I've just been waiting to make the WCA and I'm
[01:54:13.400 --> 01:54:19.480]  almost like backing off. And I tell you that the worm castings in water once a week is killer.
[01:54:21.080 --> 01:54:26.120]  And I'm not going to like, I mean, the IMO is great. I think everybody should get some,
[01:54:26.680 --> 01:54:30.840]  if you don't do the whole IMO one through four process, definitely get some forest biology in
[01:54:30.840 --> 01:54:37.000]  there before you, before you plant. But I use the IMO three in my weekly tea. So I'm using worm
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:47.080]  castings and the IMO three, basically making a liquid IMO with worm castings. And then occasionally
[01:54:47.080 --> 01:54:54.120]  I add in a little kelp meal or I'll add in some bakashi or I'll add in a couple of other things,
[01:54:54.120 --> 01:55:00.120]  maybe a little calculus, calculus algae, if I want to throw some more calcium in there.
[01:55:01.160 --> 01:55:06.440]  But yeah, pretty much I'm following, I do that weekly tea and it's mostly a root trench. I'll
[01:55:06.440 --> 01:55:10.120]  do a little foliar and veg, but I'm primarily doing a root trench approach.
[01:55:15.910 --> 01:55:23.110]  And a while ago, there was a question about preventative measures for powdery mildew.
[01:55:23.750 --> 01:55:32.550]  So that comes down to genetics and endosymbionts or endo, just bacterial and fungal relationships.
[01:55:33.190 --> 01:55:39.270]  So one, make sure you're growing something that isn't a PM magnet as far as genetics. And then
[01:55:39.270 --> 01:55:46.070]  two, you got to be in good soil with a lot of active microbes. Cause maybe not specifically
[01:55:46.070 --> 01:55:51.910]  PM, but things like fusarium and when you have a really active soil community, they'll back off,
[01:55:51.910 --> 01:55:57.670]  they'll be in their little corner doing their little job. But when there's just like not that
[01:55:57.670 --> 01:56:02.310]  much of a community and that fusarium or PM is the first one on the scene, like they're on there.
[01:56:02.870 --> 01:56:11.510]  And yeah, PM is not systemically infectious. So it's all about where it lands. You need to have
[01:56:11.510 --> 01:56:17.830]  kind of good biology all over your plant. Yeah, I don't know. I don't do that much
[01:56:17.830 --> 01:56:21.030]  preventative other than just good genetics and good soil.
[01:56:23.110 --> 01:56:27.830]  Big part of it for me too, I make sure my environment's on point. Not a lot of crazy
[01:56:27.830 --> 01:56:34.550]  swings back and forth. That's what usually causes these things to sporulate. And that's when they're
[01:56:34.550 --> 01:56:39.030]  going to attempt to pierce the leaf surface. That's when the problems develop. And I think
[01:56:39.030 --> 01:56:45.750]  I agree with everything you said as well as, you know, making sure that you have a rugged lipid
[01:56:45.750 --> 01:56:52.070]  layer on the outside of your leaves whenever possible just to mechanically prevent the PM
[01:56:52.070 --> 01:56:59.030]  from taking hold. I think it's yeah. And just keep that airflow moving air turnover, especially.
[01:56:59.750 --> 01:57:05.670]  Yeah, I think genetics are huge. I mean, we've talked on in a DM before about just like coastal
[01:57:05.670 --> 01:57:11.990]  island genetics, like Northern Coastal, like I'm popping the Royal Kush right now. So I'm really
[01:57:11.990 --> 01:57:17.430]  making the goal just having plants that I can throw outside and PM is not going to fucking
[01:57:17.430 --> 01:57:22.790]  touch it because I think genetics is really what it comes down to. Yeah. Yeah. All those things are
[01:57:22.790 --> 01:57:27.270]  present. Those mechanical factors are present because of the genetics. It's predisposed to
[01:57:27.270 --> 01:57:33.350]  being. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's like it's like eczema or something on people. It's like some
[01:57:33.350 --> 01:57:41.350]  people are just susceptible to it. Don't get it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But definitely when controllable
[01:57:42.310 --> 01:57:48.070]  you know, focus on that and if you can, if you can. Yeah, exactly. Go with them.
[01:57:48.710 --> 01:57:57.590]  Yeah. Air movement. And I definitely water less during flower just because I don't know that I
[01:57:57.590 --> 01:58:02.230]  don't have that much transpiration, like all the little leaves over the buds. That's where you get
[01:58:02.230 --> 01:58:07.830]  bud rot coming in. Yeah. And that's that's different, I guess. Undercarriage is super
[01:58:07.830 --> 01:58:14.710]  important where you can get those little pockets of problem pockets. But yeah, absolutely. Those
[01:58:14.710 --> 01:58:19.110]  other things on point, even then, like I'm slacking right now, I'm cleaning up my undercarriage.
[01:58:19.110 --> 01:58:23.750]  There's absolutely zero issue in there at all. But it's just one of those maintenance things
[01:58:23.750 --> 01:58:29.510]  that you can do. Good housekeeping. Yeah. Outside, you know, it will help to clean and thin out
[01:58:29.510 --> 01:58:35.430]  your plant where where necessary. And obviously, you need those older panels.
[01:58:35.910 --> 01:58:41.910]  The worm leachate. Oh, yeah. The worm. Yeah. I don't actually think I don't get a lot of
[01:58:42.470 --> 01:58:48.870]  worm leachate out of my bin because it's so small. In general, I've heard mixed things about worm
[01:58:48.870 --> 01:58:55.430]  leachate. Most it's either you use it right away or you just throw it away. I don't think worm
[01:58:55.430 --> 01:59:00.870]  leachate is something you want to keep around. It doesn't necessarily lend itself to being brewed
[01:59:01.590 --> 01:59:05.670]  in a tea to improving a tea is my understanding. If you're going to use it, you want to use it
[01:59:05.670 --> 01:59:13.430]  right away. But isn't necessarily a great product. Yeah, I don't think you should be producing a lot
[01:59:13.430 --> 01:59:18.790]  of worm leachate. I mean, that would that would mean that you're probably watering the worm bin
[01:59:18.790 --> 01:59:23.270]  or something or using a lot of really watery food waste. I think you should try to have it to a
[01:59:23.270 --> 01:59:30.230]  point where you're not having any runoff at all. You might want to add more paper or dryer things.
[01:59:30.230 --> 01:59:35.670]  Or even to try to. Yeah. With the with the worm bins, I've been going more the route of
[01:59:35.670 --> 01:59:39.670]  instead of using it to recycle green waste, because, I mean, I got the normal thermophilic
[01:59:39.670 --> 01:59:43.510]  compost for that. I'll just start with, like I was saying, that leaf mold where I'm starting
[01:59:43.510 --> 01:59:48.630]  with something where I could already just use that as a compost extract. And so I'm just letting the
[01:59:48.630 --> 01:59:53.270]  worms kind of turn that over. And so I guess that's a different methodology than just doing
[01:59:53.270 --> 01:59:59.350]  the having like an indoor compost bin to like recycle food waste. In that instance, you might
[01:59:59.350 --> 02:00:03.910]  produce more leachate when you've got a bunch of green waste in there. But I think you should try
[02:00:03.910 --> 02:00:07.910]  and be careful and set it up in a way where you're not going to be having a lot of runoff.
[02:00:09.750 --> 02:00:12.630]  At the end of the day, you're losing some good nutrition out of that, too.
[02:00:13.270 --> 02:00:16.470]  And if it's just wet down there, you're just going to get anaerobic and nasty.
[02:00:16.470 --> 02:00:17.670]  Correct. Correct.
[02:00:17.670 --> 02:00:23.910]  Just something to avoid, I'd say. But if you got it, use it. Pour it on your plants.
[02:00:24.070 --> 02:00:36.710]  So I think we've been going for two hours, and that's probably a good break because I got
[02:00:36.710 --> 02:00:38.950]  James Loud in an hour. Oh, yeah.
[02:00:40.150 --> 02:00:48.710]  Microbe Alchemist at two. Good cat. That should be a fun conversation.
[02:00:48.710 --> 02:00:53.190]  He's a good guy. But yeah, there is. And I know
[02:00:53.190 --> 02:00:57.270]  Miss Sonic's lurking in the chat right now. He's going to have some things to say.
[02:00:58.390 --> 02:01:02.310]  So let me just here. Give me one second. So this is Matt Riott.
[02:01:03.030 --> 02:01:08.790]  Yeah, the real Matt Riott. So this is coming up in an hour. So I'm going to go
[02:01:08.790 --> 02:01:19.350]  eat some breakfast and check out my iced coffee. And then at 2 p.m. Yes, he fixed it. 2 p.m. Pacific,
[02:01:19.350 --> 02:01:27.430]  5 p.m. Eastern. We got what will potentially be a contentious show.
[02:01:30.390 --> 02:01:36.630]  But anyway, we'll see how that goes. But I appreciate it. And we need to have you come back,
[02:01:36.630 --> 02:01:41.590]  answer more questions. Blue, thanks for popping in. Theo from the Vineyard.
[02:01:41.590 --> 02:01:43.190]  Yeah, thanks for having me on.
[02:01:43.190 --> 02:01:44.470]  Matt is Vineyard.
[02:01:44.470 --> 02:01:47.110]  My boys. You got two of my good friends on here. So that's awesome.
[02:01:47.110 --> 02:01:49.750]  You're going to go catch some lobster after the show.
[02:01:49.750 --> 02:01:54.630]  Oh, yeah. But that's more that's more main. I don't know.
[02:01:57.350 --> 02:01:59.910]  Thank you very much for having me, Peter. I really appreciate it.
[02:01:59.910 --> 02:02:00.790]  Yeah, thanks for having me.
[02:02:00.790 --> 02:02:05.110]  I'm very honored and humbled to be included on your show. It's an awesome show.
[02:02:05.110 --> 02:02:12.310]  I really appreciate it. And just quickly, there was what was his name in the chat?
[02:02:12.310 --> 02:02:19.910]  Mr. Lincoln's Brute Groots Roots. Yes, I will bring your breeding question up in a
[02:02:19.910 --> 02:02:25.110]  breeding conversation, which could potentially be the very next show with Mr. James Loud.
[02:02:26.470 --> 02:02:34.550]  And so, yes, I try to put the appropriate question to the appropriate group of people.
[02:02:35.270 --> 02:02:37.350]  And this was more, I felt like a.
[02:02:38.150 --> 02:02:39.830]  Definitely not going to answer breeder questions.
[02:02:40.310 --> 02:02:45.110]  Yeah, not a reason. We'll throw you some high heat inside with the questions.
[02:02:46.470 --> 02:02:49.670]  Mr. Toad, we need to bring you back soon.
[02:02:50.470 --> 02:02:53.030]  And Mr. Toad, Mr. Toad.
[02:02:53.030 --> 02:02:57.990]  I'm just having there is a Kevin Jodry sighting. Kevin's probably in his
[02:02:58.790 --> 02:03:03.510]  Kevin's great. His bathrobe lounging and relaxing up and humble.
[02:03:03.510 --> 02:03:07.270]  Well, hopefully you got to fight enough cows and hopefully got a good peek at that
[02:03:07.270 --> 02:03:08.790]  black lime reserve to.
[02:03:08.790 --> 02:03:14.630]  I know I think Kevin probably tuned in late, but yeah, we you were featured prominently in this
[02:03:14.630 --> 02:03:23.030]  conversation. Yeah. Yes. I know. And I've been talking to Lemon Coco and.
[02:03:25.350 --> 02:03:29.830]  Get Kyle in there with him. OK, that would be dope.
[02:03:32.070 --> 02:03:34.390]  You want to leave that question, that conversation?
[02:03:35.350 --> 02:03:39.350]  Do I? I will, if you want me to. OK, I'll be there.
[02:03:39.990 --> 02:03:45.510]  That are being involved in it. Yeah. All right. Well, have me on, Peter.
[02:03:45.510 --> 02:03:51.590]  Well, thank you. You got it. You got it. I figured I shot some emails to some other mass people,
[02:03:51.590 --> 02:03:58.550]  but I don't think people check their emails. But we need to get we need to get the mass crew.
[02:03:59.110 --> 02:04:01.830]  That's us. I'm always down to talk or New England.
[02:04:02.630 --> 02:04:05.030]  You got a couple of good ones, though, from Massa.
[02:04:06.150 --> 02:04:09.510]  Absolutely. And I got my if I can find them. Hold on.
[02:04:10.150 --> 02:04:13.430]  I know my my Celtic shirts are over in the corner.
[02:04:15.030 --> 02:04:19.990]  Anyway, I'll see hopefully some of you in fifty five minutes.
[02:04:21.270 --> 02:04:23.750]  Yeah. Have an awesome day, everybody. Thank you. Take it easy.
[02:04:24.390 --> 02:04:25.830]  See you guys. See you guys.
[02:04:26.390 --> 02:04:27.830]  One love.
