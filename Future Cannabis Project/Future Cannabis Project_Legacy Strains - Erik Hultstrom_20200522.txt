[00:00.700 --> 00:07.940]  So Eric, let's put you on the the cannabis business psychiatrist chair. So
[00:07.940 --> 00:16.540]  tell us, I want to dig into kind of your path and your journey. So you're, do
[00:16.540 --> 00:21.780]  you know anyone else who is as small as you are from a cultivation square
[00:21.780 --> 00:28.900]  footage standpoint, which is 2,500 square feet? No, no, a lot of my friends
[00:28.900 --> 00:32.820]  that I work with, you know, they have much larger facilities, 10,000 square
[00:32.820 --> 00:38.980]  feet. You know, I'm a bit of an outlier. Lauren, do you know any cultivators that
[00:38.980 --> 00:47.060]  are only at 2,500 square feet? Hmm, I'll bet I might know one or two, but not
[00:47.060 --> 00:53.100]  that I can think of. It doesn't jump out at you. All right, so how did this
[00:53.100 --> 01:01.100]  happen? Is it by choice? Is it by necessity? Is it tactical? You're
[01:01.100 --> 01:09.060]  playing chess when everyone else is playing checkers? Yeah, you know,
[01:09.060 --> 01:12.740]  that's an interesting question. How many businesses are like, oh yeah, I like
[01:12.740 --> 01:20.020]  being really, really small, you know, going bigger. It's kind of, you know, I've
[01:20.300 --> 01:24.740]  been in this since early 2005, so I've kind of seen the evolution of this
[01:24.740 --> 01:31.620]  industry. And I would say probably around 2009 or 2010, you started noticing more
[01:31.620 --> 01:36.100]  outside money coming in. You know, back in the Bush years, everybody was scared to
[01:36.100 --> 01:41.020]  get into cannabis unless you were okay with the idea of going to jail for
[01:41.020 --> 01:45.900]  selling cannabis, you know. And a lot of people, that's not okay with them.
[01:46.060 --> 01:51.380]  You know, it's kind of a few of us kind of nuts that we're okay with at a
[01:51.380 --> 01:54.500]  time, but it's what we had to do. So, you know, when the Obama
[01:54.500 --> 01:58.180]  administration came in, people started to get less fearful of going to prison for
[01:58.180 --> 02:02.500]  cannabis. You started seeing more people entering the space that were hesitant to
[02:02.500 --> 02:09.100]  do it before. And by about 2010 or 11, I just started noticing more and more
[02:09.100 --> 02:15.220]  money come in. And where I saw that money backing up were operators that, you know,
[02:15.940 --> 02:19.300]  to me, I had known and they had been around and I wasn't very confident in
[02:19.300 --> 02:25.900]  their abilities to scale up. And so, fast forward further to 2014, you know, I got
[02:25.900 --> 02:30.700]  my small warehouse here. And by 2014, a 5,000 square foot warehouse was not on
[02:30.700 --> 02:36.540]  the low end of things, you know. It was medium to small, you know. But, you know,
[02:36.540 --> 02:40.140]  people were just starting to look at 20,000 square foot warehouse and really
[02:40.140 --> 02:45.180]  going bigger. So, as this is going, even more money is coming in and these
[02:45.180 --> 02:49.780]  operations are kind of getting very inefficient. And then, as we were looking
[02:49.780 --> 02:54.740]  to expand about 2016 and we started having to compete with the really cheap
[02:54.740 --> 03:01.180]  money out there. And we looked at a bunch of spaces, we spent about a year and we
[03:01.540 --> 03:06.100]  landlord started charging exorbitant fees for space. You know, we'd look at
[03:06.100 --> 03:10.100]  places with rent like at $3 a square foot and it was completely unsustainable.
[03:10.540 --> 03:15.820]  So, for us, we're a bootstrap operation. We can't, you know, we don't have a huge
[03:15.820 --> 03:21.940]  fund to operate at a loss and as we try to gain market share. So, basically, just
[03:21.940 --> 03:27.140]  put my head down and we're just going to work with what we had and just try to
[03:27.140 --> 03:30.940]  weather the storm. I knew at some point the bubble would pop. And if you have a
[03:30.940 --> 03:38.500]  large operation that isn't making money, it's just a lot more to cover. And so,
[03:38.540 --> 03:42.620]  with us, we've kept a small lean operation. So, going through this, you
[03:42.620 --> 03:47.900]  know, we've really had an easy time managing the storm. And at some point,
[03:47.900 --> 03:52.900]  when this pops, my idea was some of these companies are not going to make it
[03:52.900 --> 03:58.860]  because they're just structurally incapable of surviving. And so, when that
[03:58.860 --> 04:03.180]  happens, permits are going to be coming up. The price should drop from $3 a
[04:03.180 --> 04:06.740]  square foot down to something reasonable, even $1.50, which is still a
[04:06.740 --> 04:13.500]  little overpriced, but still can work. So, that's the plan is just keeping solid
[04:13.500 --> 04:19.340]  with our small operation, running tight books. And, you know, we'll grab the
[04:19.340 --> 04:22.820]  opportunity when it makes sense. And, you know, over the last three, four years
[04:22.820 --> 04:27.780]  looking at it, it hasn't made sense. And we looked at expansion would mean
[04:27.800 --> 04:33.340]  something unsustainable. And that would mean bringing on more investors. And, you
[04:33.340 --> 04:36.860]  know, I'm in this for the long run, I want to have a company 10 years from
[04:36.860 --> 04:40.940]  now, 20 years from now. And we're not, you know, we're, we weren't trying to
[04:40.940 --> 04:44.340]  build something up and just flip it and get out of it. You know, like, I'm a
[04:44.340 --> 04:44.940]  lifer.
[04:45.820 --> 04:50.500]  Eric, this is super interesting. One of the themes that's raised it's
[04:50.540 --> 04:59.940]  interesting that in the current uncertain times, smaller operations may
[04:59.940 --> 05:07.020]  have an advantage over the larger ones. And that smaller operations kind of
[05:07.020 --> 05:12.060]  defines you. What do you feel about that? And also, do you think that you might
[05:12.060 --> 05:16.940]  see real estate prices start to come down and maybe more opportunities, some
[05:16.940 --> 05:21.540]  spaces that were previously unavailable, become available?
[05:24.210 --> 05:29.690]  I think it has to happen. I can't envision a scenario. You know, we, we all
[05:29.690 --> 05:34.090]  know there are some larger companies out there that are running pretty serious
[05:34.090 --> 05:42.010]  operating deficits. And I think if the laws of percentages, you know, it's a
[05:42.010 --> 05:46.250]  larger company, if everybody's operating at the same loss percentage, the larger
[05:46.250 --> 05:51.330]  company, it's really going to be a bigger number than a smaller company. So I mean,
[05:51.330 --> 05:55.690]  that's one thing where I think the smaller company does have an advantage.
[05:56.290 --> 06:00.370]  Obviously, you have to do things well, having a small company that's failing
[06:00.450 --> 06:03.530]  versus a large company that's failing, it's all failing, you know, it's just,
[06:03.850 --> 06:08.410]  what's the level of failure? I mean, I've always likened this kind of to the late
[06:08.410 --> 06:14.290]  90s dot com boom, where, you know, you can't have 10 companies selling pet food
[06:14.290 --> 06:18.610]  online. But at the same time, it's going to come down to just a couple of them,
[06:18.610 --> 06:23.210]  some of them are going to be inefficient. But weathering the storm, especially if
[06:23.490 --> 06:28.650]  all 10 of those companies are operating at deficits, operating at the smallest
[06:28.650 --> 06:32.610]  deficit is going to be the advantage, you know, and at some point, turning that
[06:32.610 --> 06:35.850]  into round, you're going to be the quickest to actually start operating on
[06:35.850 --> 06:40.490]  profits. And at that point, I think the world's going to be your oyster. And with
[06:40.490 --> 06:45.290]  most cannabis cultivators, I know, I don't I can't really think of any of them
[06:45.290 --> 06:49.930]  that are really running on profits right now, everybody is some are very close to
[06:49.930 --> 06:54.050]  breaking even and some are far away from breaking even. But I don't really know of
[06:54.050 --> 06:58.850]  any cultivators that are just, you know, absolutely destroying it on their books.
[06:58.850 --> 07:02.850]  It's, you know, it's me, I'm sure there might be one or two that are kind of
[07:02.850 --> 07:07.690]  barely there. But it's just what the taxes where they are, it's near impossible.
[07:08.490 --> 07:13.570]  So let's dig into this a little bit. And we've talked before, we're friends, I've
[07:13.570 --> 07:17.850]  interviewed you. And we've talked about your business, and you have tight margins,
[07:17.850 --> 07:23.570]  right? Like you run a really tight lean operation. And I think the last time we
[07:23.570 --> 07:27.890]  talked, you said, like, as long as people are willing to spend, you know, 50 bucks
[07:27.890 --> 07:33.810]  for an A, you're going to do okay. So are people still willing to see that? And
[07:33.850 --> 07:38.330]  what about the dynamics that are outside of your control price points at the
[07:38.330 --> 07:45.250]  dispensary and, and all of that, all of that stuff that, that, you know, could
[07:45.250 --> 07:51.930]  potentially affect you really seriously? Have you had to? Are you changing a lot of
[07:51.930 --> 07:57.970]  shops? Is your product like what do you know? How have you had to let some people
[07:57.970 --> 08:02.890]  go? How have you survived and maintained with those thin margins?
[08:04.450 --> 08:10.170]  We, we actually, we brought one more person on. So on ours, we haven't let
[08:10.170 --> 08:15.130]  anybody go. We've hired one more person. We have a team right now.
[08:15.890 --> 08:22.050]  We have seven employees, up from six to seven. And then there's three managers,
[08:22.090 --> 08:27.490]  which I consider myself a manager as well. Yeah, and that and that's part of
[08:27.490 --> 08:31.770]  it. I do. A lot of the companies will have four people doing what I do. You
[08:31.770 --> 08:39.210]  know, I'm, I'm the head of sales. I also handle the compliance, the metric, the
[08:39.210 --> 08:45.210]  accounting, quality control, and I, and I still do deliveries as well. So which is
[08:45.450 --> 08:49.570]  not, as far as I know, about the only owner of a company that shows up at
[08:49.570 --> 08:53.530]  dispensaries with the deliveries and it's like, Hey, I'm the owner too. So, but
[08:53.730 --> 08:58.290]  it's great because, you know, again, I'm also, I also do the marketing and with no
[08:58.290 --> 09:02.970]  marketing budget, you just have to be creative, you know, and you have to, you
[09:02.970 --> 09:07.210]  know, my, a lot of my competitors have a large have, well, they used to have a
[09:07.210 --> 09:11.650]  large marketing budgets and I never had a marketing budget. So it's kind of a,
[09:11.650 --> 09:16.890]  my, my strategy is always asymmetrical warfare. If, if your, you know, if your
[09:16.890 --> 09:20.770]  opponents are doing one thing and you can't do it, you have to figure out
[09:20.770 --> 09:24.410]  something that they can't do. And so with me, it was just engagement on the ground
[09:24.410 --> 09:30.250]  level of people at shops. They can spend $50,000 a month on marketing. I can't do
[09:30.250 --> 09:35.010]  that, but I can go into the shops and personally make connections and bond with
[09:35.010 --> 09:38.530]  staff there and get them to become believers in my product, you know, and
[09:38.850 --> 09:42.650]  that that's something you can't do with the marketing budget, you know, unless you
[09:42.650 --> 09:47.170]  just can't because your, your team isn't going to go to the same levels that an
[09:47.170 --> 09:49.170]  owner of a company is going to go to. So,
[09:49.410 --> 09:54.410]  So just quickly, you're the one managing like the Instagram and all that stuff.
[09:54.770 --> 09:59.730]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. As you can see by my whopping 1500 followers, so I'm a better
[09:59.730 --> 10:01.610]  farmer than a social media guy.
[10:02.210 --> 10:09.090]  Yeah. So back to price points, you're a quality grower. You're like, where now do
[10:09.090 --> 10:14.450]  you lay in the, in the, in the scale of price points in the shops and how
[10:14.450 --> 10:18.370]  sensitive are they to, to that right now?
[10:19.090 --> 10:19.490]  So,
[10:19.490 --> 10:21.450]  Which, which shelf are you on?
[10:22.650 --> 10:27.690]  We're definitely a top shelf product and our direct competitors are the premium
[10:27.690 --> 10:28.650]  brands out there.
[10:29.130 --> 10:32.850]  So who, who would be some of the other top shelf brands?
[10:33.410 --> 10:40.890]  Things like Maven, Kingsgarden. There, there was one other one. I got to throw
[10:40.890 --> 10:45.690]  THC designs out there, you know, cause I love those guys. Pearl Pharma is another
[10:45.690 --> 10:51.850]  great brand. But, but, you know, so some of those, I'm very good friend, Pearl
[10:51.850 --> 10:55.930]  Pharma, THC designs are very good friends with them. We go way back, you know,
[10:55.930 --> 11:00.050]  they're, they're like friend competitors. You know, I'm, I'm happy to see those
[11:00.050 --> 11:04.370]  customers. I mean, I'm happy to see every business in our space do well. Cause at
[11:04.370 --> 11:08.090]  the end of the day, I'm a cannabis community guy and we're all cannabis
[11:08.090 --> 11:12.770]  community. And, you know, I, I want every business in our space to do well because
[11:12.770 --> 11:15.250]  we're weed people, you know, and it's better to get along as weed people
[11:15.250 --> 11:19.570]  without, but, but those are our direct competitors or those companies. They're
[11:19.570 --> 11:23.570]  also doing a very great job. They're producing great flower and they're at
[11:23.570 --> 11:27.250]  price points similar to us. What I have noticed in the last two months is there
[11:27.250 --> 11:31.610]  has been some volatility in the wholesale market price. And I have noticed
[11:31.610 --> 11:36.370]  some downward pressure just generally, you know, I think premium price used to
[11:36.370 --> 11:41.930]  be, you know, about $21 to 25 or 26 wholesale. And I see it starting to kind
[11:41.930 --> 11:46.690]  of fall to around 18 to 20. And I think it's starting to get hard no matter how
[11:46.690 --> 11:52.610]  good the product is to go much over 20. Some of them do. So we're starting to
[11:52.610 --> 11:56.290]  really look at wholesale pricing and how it's going to affect our margin as
[11:56.290 --> 12:02.210]  well. And, you know, and as far as that, just getting efficiencies and yield
[12:02.210 --> 12:07.930]  increases to offset any sort of a wholesale price if we have to look that
[12:07.930 --> 12:12.370]  way. But, you know, analyzing wholesale prices is definitely just, just from
[12:12.370 --> 12:16.530]  talking to buyers, we've been looking new shops. I just brought on a sales
[12:16.530 --> 12:20.570]  person as well to start going through the San Diego area. We're going to start
[12:20.570 --> 12:24.730]  looking at, you know, a lot of the new shops that are being carried down there.
[12:24.730 --> 12:28.170]  You know, this is all the same. We've actually in the last two months been
[12:28.170 --> 12:33.130]  looking more at expanding than contracting. So, you know, it's a good
[12:33.130 --> 12:36.090]  thing. It's kind of the moment we've been waiting for. And I've been waiting for
[12:36.090 --> 12:42.210]  the kind of crash to happen. And this is for us in a small company. I feel like
[12:42.210 --> 12:45.930]  this is going to be our time here to break out. So that's kind of what we're
[12:45.930 --> 12:49.570]  pushing for. So we're definitely being more aggressive right now than we have
[12:49.650 --> 12:50.090]  been.
[12:50.090 --> 12:53.730]  You're saying that you don't need to be in a lot of shops. So how many shops are
[12:53.730 --> 12:54.530]  you in now?
[12:55.210 --> 13:02.930]  We, as of last week, we were in 16. We are now in 18 shops. And, you know, we're
[13:03.250 --> 13:06.730]  optimistic we're going to have three or four more by next week. And we're going
[13:06.730 --> 13:10.530]  to be any close to our cap. I think we can probably sustain right now with our
[13:10.530 --> 13:15.530]  increase about 24 shops total. So we're, we're bumping up to that next level. And
[13:15.530 --> 13:18.130]  at that point, we're going to have to stop or else we're not going to be able
[13:18.130 --> 13:21.570]  to keep up with the pace of the market. So we're going to have to be more
[13:21.570 --> 13:24.490]  aggressive. And we're going to have to be more aggressive in terms of the
[13:24.490 --> 13:28.530]  number of shops. And then at that point is when we start looking to expand.
[13:28.890 --> 13:32.890]  And are you following kind of the craft beer model, which is you, you
[13:32.890 --> 13:36.890]  concentrically start with your home turf, like you're not trying to sell up into
[13:36.890 --> 13:43.570]  Humboldt and the Bay Area and Sacramento as a tiny LA brand? Or are you spreading
[13:43.570 --> 13:44.090]  out?
[13:44.090 --> 13:46.250]  Legacy is an important part of your brand, right?
[13:47.370 --> 13:51.650]  Yeah, yeah, it is. It is, which is, which is funny, when I thought up the name
[13:51.650 --> 13:56.850]  legacy, it wasn't a term for the old heirloom strains that it is now, but it
[13:56.850 --> 14:00.210]  just kind of worked out. But I'm, you know, I'm a big history nerd. I've been
[14:00.210 --> 14:04.650]  in shops since early 2005. And I started noticing a lot of the strains from that
[14:04.650 --> 14:09.770]  day were just disappearing. And so pretty much what we run is almost a history
[14:09.770 --> 14:14.930]  library, we we run the heirloom strains, most of our stuff is 10 to 30 years old,
[14:14.930 --> 14:19.970]  our genetics, you know, we have the master kush, which nobody really has, we
[14:19.970 --> 14:24.690]  have train wreck, which is another one that's pretty much disappeared. We run
[14:24.690 --> 14:28.490]  sour diesel, but the real the the Massachusetts skunk chem dog from the
[14:28.490 --> 14:33.690]  90s. That's what we run, we have a Malibu 91 OG from Rick Shiva, we got, you know,
[14:33.690 --> 14:39.210]  we got that from, you know, old legendary 90s grower that passed away about nine
[14:39.210 --> 14:44.650]  years ago. But anybody around LA in the early 2000s knew who Rick Shiva was at
[14:44.650 --> 14:50.090]  the early shops. But yeah, we really specialize in the old classic. Afu Maui
[14:50.090 --> 14:55.850]  Waui is another one we have. And, you know, for me, I'm 42. And I know a lot of
[14:55.850 --> 15:00.490]  people in their late 30s and 40s remember these old strains. And, you know,
[15:00.490 --> 15:06.370]  at some point, lava cakes are good, and the various gelatos and sherberts. And
[15:06.810 --> 15:11.370]  it's great. But sometimes you just want those classic strains that you can find
[15:11.370 --> 15:14.610]  in the Big Book of Buds, or you'd read about, you know, in high times, and
[15:14.610 --> 15:17.410]  Rosenthal was growing back in the day, you know, I think there's a lot of
[15:17.690 --> 15:22.290]  appetite for the nostalgia. And I just would hate to see it disappear. And
[15:22.290 --> 15:26.890]  since cannabis and genetics is such an oral history, you know, it really just
[15:26.890 --> 15:31.770]  relies on kind of storytellers to keep it alive, you know, and we're kind of a
[15:32.010 --> 15:33.970]  storyteller with what we grow, I think.
[15:34.410 --> 15:39.730]  So sorry, with 2500 square feet, you have how many different cultivars?
[15:40.370 --> 15:44.530]  We have 12, which is, you know, not the most efficient thing. And we don't run
[15:44.530 --> 15:48.730]  all 12 at once. You know, some of them we run more seasonally, we probably have
[15:48.730 --> 15:53.330]  four main strains that we do the most of, but we'll rotate in other ones here
[15:53.330 --> 15:56.970]  and there. Again, just because I just don't want to lose them. And at some
[15:56.970 --> 16:00.490]  point, we have a larger facility, you know, we can focus more on it. But
[16:01.050 --> 16:05.090]  does the seasonality work from a marketing standpoint, where it's kind of
[16:05.090 --> 16:10.250]  like, hey, this, this, this strain dropped in this shot or in all the shops
[16:10.250 --> 16:13.650]  and get it now because it won't be around for long and people come running
[16:13.650 --> 16:18.810]  in because they know that they won't be able to get it in a month.
[16:19.250 --> 16:22.850]  It's really more, you know, when you flash my social media with my small
[16:22.850 --> 16:27.050]  number on it, the one thing with that is that everybody on that are very
[16:27.050 --> 16:32.610]  dedicated legacy fans. And, you know, I can be very accessible with 1600
[16:32.610 --> 16:36.250]  people when they message me, I talk to them back, we totally will geek out on
[16:36.250 --> 16:45.970]  genetics all the time on there. But it's more like it's really more the rare
[16:45.970 --> 16:49.650]  ones like the like the legacy glue, which is you know, Gorilla Glue 4, which
[16:49.650 --> 16:53.410]  can't call it that people will hit me up say when is this coming out and miss
[16:53.450 --> 16:57.730]  this strain. But Gorilla Glue is still prevalent enough that you can't you
[16:57.730 --> 17:01.330]  can't run it that much. He just has trouble moving because it's so flooded.
[17:01.490 --> 17:06.010]  So it's more people will hit me up say when is this coming out? When is this
[17:06.010 --> 17:10.410]  coming out? Or you know, and it's more kind of the demand picks up like that.
[17:10.410 --> 17:14.770]  And of course, the second the second I stopped running something for a bit,
[17:14.770 --> 17:18.490]  then everybody everybody hits me up for it is the nature of the beast.
[17:19.490 --> 17:25.290]  That's a good problem to have. All right. So on an annual basis, kind of what's
[17:25.290 --> 17:30.290]  your capacity for like, how many pounds of flour are you producing per year? How
[17:30.290 --> 17:32.370]  many turns are you doing per year?
[17:34.850 --> 17:39.210]  This year, we're on track to do right around 300 pounds.
[17:40.090 --> 17:48.250]  Okay. And and then are you sending kind of biomass out for extraction like it
[17:48.690 --> 17:55.330]  are you is the whole animal being killed and eaten and used and or are you using
[17:55.330 --> 17:56.170]  it all yourself?
[17:57.010 --> 18:01.410]  We use it all ourselves. We use all of the animal and funny you said that these
[18:01.410 --> 18:06.570]  are our pre rolls that we are working on. They go in they go into these nice
[18:06.570 --> 18:12.290]  little pre roll boxes. These are our small nugs and our sugar leaf. Part of
[18:12.290 --> 18:16.490]  the advantages of having a small crew is that my processing team does everything
[18:16.490 --> 18:20.890]  from harvest all the way to pre rolls. They you know, they do the packaging,
[18:20.890 --> 18:25.290]  they do the trimming. So our process, you know, as it comes down, you have your
[18:25.290 --> 18:30.330]  big families that don't have THC on it. Those all get trimmed off for the drying
[18:30.330 --> 18:34.330]  process. When the trimming happens, the sugar leaf that comes in gets combined
[18:34.330 --> 18:39.370]  with the small nugs. Our sugar leaf when we used to get a sound processing tested
[18:39.370 --> 18:45.090]  already around 18%. So it's very good viable material, along with our small
[18:45.090 --> 18:49.690]  buds, which are test around 22%. So we blend those together. Our pre rolls tend
[18:49.690 --> 18:54.970]  to average about 20% THC, and we use everything. So we're not sending any
[18:54.970 --> 18:59.530]  biomass out because the prices on biomass are pretty tough. You know, and
[18:59.530 --> 19:03.930]  we kind of came to this about four years ago when the prices on biomass was at
[19:03.970 --> 19:09.330]  probably the lowest has been which was 150 a pound. And I'm looking at my
[19:09.330 --> 19:14.170]  really nice indoor grown with lots of terpenes and a great aroma to it and
[19:14.170 --> 19:18.810]  150 a pound. I just felt insulted by it. And so I was thinking, what do I do with
[19:18.810 --> 19:23.170]  it? You know, we're so we started working to create pre rolls. And so that's
[19:23.170 --> 19:28.370]  another thing is to say this aside from our 300 pounds, we generate about 120
[19:28.370 --> 19:31.490]  pounds of material that goes into pre rolls as well.
[19:31.490 --> 19:37.210]  Are you doing any kind of ice water hash or anything like that?
[19:37.930 --> 19:43.050]  I don't we don't you know, we are strictly a cultivator. So we are allowed
[19:43.050 --> 19:46.970]  to do pre rolls and flower. We're not allowed to do any extractions with our
[19:46.970 --> 19:50.610]  permit. So I would have to contract that out. And then I'm competing with the
[19:50.610 --> 19:54.930]  biomass market. And they look at a pound of my stuff like a pound of outdoor
[19:54.930 --> 19:55.410]  stuff.
[19:56.770 --> 20:02.410]  If there weren't that regulatory issue, would you have a washing machine on
[20:02.410 --> 20:06.690]  site? Like if you could do it tomorrow, if the regular just wave the magic
[20:06.690 --> 20:10.690]  wand, would you start doing that maybe do like hash infused pre rolls or
[20:10.690 --> 20:11.610]  something like that?
[20:12.970 --> 20:20.770]  I, I used to do this back in like 2008 or nine, which you know, I used to get
[20:20.770 --> 20:25.370]  into extractions and I used to take my trim and make hash out of it. And I kind
[20:25.370 --> 20:30.450]  of realized quickly on that what I love to do is grow cannabis. And I knew other
[20:30.450 --> 20:35.290]  people out there that love to do extractions. And so my passion with
[20:35.290 --> 20:40.130]  extractions doesn't come anywhere near matching theirs. And so I felt like
[20:40.730 --> 20:44.610]  they're going to do so much better of a job than I can. I don't want to compete
[20:44.610 --> 20:48.810]  with somebody is patting in an area they're passionate about, because what
[20:48.810 --> 20:53.250]  I'm passionate about is growing flower, you know, so I felt it's just really
[20:53.250 --> 20:58.250]  good to stick to what I love to do. And you know, not do something that I'm not
[20:58.450 --> 21:04.530]  as into it. And then the pre rolls, moving to pre rolls instead just made
[21:04.530 --> 21:08.690]  sense. And I really I think it was a great decision that we did. Our pre
[21:08.690 --> 21:11.370]  rolls are they're excellent pre rolls, you know.
[21:12.210 --> 21:17.410]  And how many are going to be in a pack? Like what's the and then the wholesale
[21:17.410 --> 21:18.170]  on that?
[21:20.730 --> 21:22.490]  Um, are so
[21:23.010 --> 21:23.530]  suggest?
[21:24.570 --> 21:30.090]  I'm happy with that. So in a pack, we do half gram, we do seven of them. Again,
[21:30.090 --> 21:34.730]  I'm a old school. So I like everything in eighths. So our payroll packs are
[21:34.730 --> 21:40.250]  one eighth joint seven half gram joints, and they tend to retail around 40 to
[21:40.250 --> 21:46.010]  $45. You know, after tax. So some places are as low as $35 plus tax retail,
[21:46.210 --> 21:51.130]  typically $40. And they're all single strain. You know, we have black haze
[21:51.130 --> 21:54.410]  pre rolls, we have sourdough pre rolls, every strain we grow, we also do a
[21:54.410 --> 21:55.450]  pre roll version of it.
[21:56.330 --> 22:01.090]  Right. And then just quickly getting back to the question I asked a while ago,
[22:01.090 --> 22:06.690]  which was, you know, your your your strategy for dealing, you know, if you
[22:06.690 --> 22:10.210]  could pick 20 retailers, my assumption is you kind of want to pick them where
[22:10.210 --> 22:13.970]  they're close, you can go visit them. And obviously not during lockdown. But,
[22:14.250 --> 22:19.890]  you know, you can do FaceTime and you're not out and, you know, on what's the
[22:19.930 --> 22:25.330]  town on the corner of the Arizona, Nevada border?
[22:25.810 --> 22:26.450]  Needles.
[22:26.450 --> 22:31.410]  Yeah, you're not like like needles isn't your starting point with winning shops
[22:31.410 --> 22:32.410]  over, right?
[22:32.730 --> 22:37.930]  No, no. Although I am in some shops in the Monterey area, a good buddy of mine
[22:37.930 --> 22:42.610]  who I go back with, Oliver Summers, who has chai cannabis. He has a shop in San
[22:42.610 --> 22:47.690]  Jose and Castroville. So, you know, two weeks ago I got my distro van. I left at
[22:47.690 --> 22:51.610]  430 a.m. and I made a delivery to Santa Cruz. I made a delivery to
[22:51.610 --> 22:56.170]  Castroville, dropped samples off at a shop in Seaside. And so I'm hoping to do
[22:56.170 --> 23:01.370]  a little circuit up there as well. But as far as shop strategy, you know, and
[23:01.370 --> 23:04.250]  this is another one where I have the advantage of being a small company. You
[23:04.250 --> 23:08.250]  know, other companies like THC design where, you know, they produce a lot of
[23:08.250 --> 23:15.570]  flour. They they they have to try to be in almost every shop. So for us, since we
[23:15.570 --> 23:20.010]  only have, for example, right now we have a capacity for 24 shops. I don't I
[23:20.010 --> 23:23.610]  don't really want to pick shops next to each other. I would like to pick shops
[23:23.610 --> 23:27.530]  like with a bit of radius. One, I'm a personal relationship and a customer
[23:27.530 --> 23:32.490]  service guy at heart. So it allows me to have this like a loyalty relationship
[23:32.490 --> 23:36.610]  with somebody else. They know that the next shop down the street isn't going to
[23:36.610 --> 23:40.610]  carry legacy strains. If people want legacy strains, they have to go to that
[23:40.610 --> 23:45.450]  shop. The other thing it does for me is it'll help me avoid slotting fees. If I
[23:45.490 --> 23:50.370]  have an instance where, which which happened to me, where a shop I had been
[23:50.370 --> 23:54.530]  to a long time hired some new buyers that came in. They tried to beat me down
[23:54.530 --> 23:57.210]  on my price. They said, you're going to drop your price or we're not going to
[23:57.210 --> 24:03.050]  carry you. So I ended up going a block and a half down the street to the
[24:03.050 --> 24:06.090]  nearest shop that carried them where a friend of mine became the senior buyer.
[24:06.090 --> 24:11.210]  And I took my whole catalog over there. They didn't want to basically beat me on
[24:11.210 --> 24:16.010]  price or charge me a slotting fee. And that's what it is. And I probably had a
[24:16.010 --> 24:20.650]  good 30 or 40 loyal customers that went to that shop that just moved a block and
[24:20.650 --> 24:25.210]  a half down the street and went to the new shop. So to me, having that sort of
[24:25.210 --> 24:29.770]  like exclusivity is what I came up with. The only leverage I'm going to have
[24:29.770 --> 24:34.330]  against slotting fees, you know, it's not I'm not going to go to a shop that has
[24:34.330 --> 24:36.130]  slotting fees because it just won't work.
[24:37.050 --> 24:43.810]  So, Lauren, you know, Eric is a small company and I assume you're working with
[24:43.810 --> 24:49.730]  lots of kind of mom and pop operations as well. Are you seeing kind of like what
[24:49.730 --> 24:56.090]  are you seeing with your client base in terms of the business and regulatory
[24:56.090 --> 24:58.450]  issues they're dealing with as small companies?
[24:59.170 --> 25:03.810]  So I do deal with a lot of small companies. And I think, you know, some of
[25:03.810 --> 25:09.410]  the points that Eric made are certainly true for my clients as well in terms of
[25:10.130 --> 25:15.130]  being able to feel a little more nimble as a small company versus a larger
[25:15.130 --> 25:19.410]  company that may have a lot more employees to have to worry about or
[25:19.410 --> 25:24.050]  something like that. But I also find that the small farmers are struggling a lot.
[25:24.970 --> 25:30.290]  There are just a lot of burdensome requirements, both from the state and
[25:30.290 --> 25:35.890]  from the local governments. The taxes are really a problem that is brought up
[25:35.890 --> 25:42.890]  often. And, you know, that lack of ability to get some of this relief right now
[25:42.890 --> 25:48.090]  from the federal government, that's something that has, you know, folks are
[25:48.090 --> 25:52.130]  hurting more so than other businesses, despite, you know, all our efforts to try
[25:52.130 --> 25:55.970]  to make this business treated just like every other business that's not really
[25:56.010 --> 26:02.530]  happening right now. So, you know, just the just the onerous rules in the
[26:02.530 --> 26:07.330]  regulations, the fear of really not knowing what's going to happen next, you
[26:07.330 --> 26:10.450]  know, in terms of is this going to be consolidated? Is it not going to be
[26:10.450 --> 26:15.770]  consolidated? Other changes that keep happening? And there's the cost, the cost
[26:15.770 --> 26:23.010]  is getting to be, it's a lot for these farmers. And so whatever, you know,
[26:23.010 --> 26:28.810]  whatever can be done to provide some both financial relief and just other
[26:28.810 --> 26:36.010]  regulatory relief would be in these, these businesses interests. That is, you
[26:36.010 --> 26:40.530]  know, the issue of dealing with having to deal with the distributor, for example,
[26:40.530 --> 26:44.770]  to do the COA testing. I know a lot of small farmers that just aren't able to
[26:44.770 --> 26:48.770]  get a distribution license due to, you know, the specifics of their property or
[26:49.210 --> 26:53.330]  financial constraints or anything. And it does put them in a situation where a
[26:53.330 --> 26:59.010]  lot of times they have, at least it seems, it feels like they have less power in
[26:59.010 --> 27:02.050]  this situation than this big distribution company they're working
[27:02.050 --> 27:09.170]  with. You know, and something that our office, what we do is we try to, you
[27:09.170 --> 27:12.490]  know, we do a lot of education to the community and to our clients. And, you
[27:12.490 --> 27:16.530]  know, we've encountered lots of circumstances where small farmers were
[27:16.530 --> 27:21.770]  being taken advantage of by other, you know, folks in the supply chain,
[27:22.170 --> 27:27.890]  distributors or retailers or what have you. And it's, you know, it's a situation
[27:27.890 --> 27:31.610]  where we have folks in this industry that are coming out of really the shadows,
[27:32.130 --> 27:36.090]  where people have been, you know, growing secretively for many years because of
[27:36.090 --> 27:41.090]  the law. Folks were told for many years not to write things down, you know, don't
[27:41.090 --> 27:45.450]  put it in a contract. Now things have changed, you know, write it down, keep
[27:45.450 --> 27:50.410]  accurate records, do it out in the open. It's not hiding anymore. And it's, it is
[27:50.410 --> 27:56.970]  quite a shift in terms of how you're operating, how your mindset is, you know,
[27:56.970 --> 28:02.090]  a lot of times there are folks that, you know, just weren't necessarily from a
[28:02.090 --> 28:06.210]  traditional business world, and maybe they can't afford to hire folks that
[28:06.210 --> 28:09.730]  specialize in each of these areas. So they are having to take a lot of that
[28:09.730 --> 28:14.690]  responsibility on for themselves. So there is just the learning curve can be
[28:14.890 --> 28:19.450]  greater for certain businesses than others, smaller businesses, but they're
[28:19.450 --> 28:25.170]  super resilient too. And I'm really hoping that the small operators are able
[28:25.170 --> 28:30.130]  to survive and they have to do things like, you know, creating a great brand
[28:30.130 --> 28:34.930]  that folks really appreciate and having that following it is it is hard to
[28:34.930 --> 28:39.730]  compete with these massive operations. But it's not impossible. I think I think
[28:39.730 --> 28:44.570]  branding is is critical. Having a great product is critical. Educating the
[28:44.570 --> 28:51.450]  community about your product about your practices. I'm excited about the OCOW
[28:51.570 --> 28:57.370]  regulations that you know, comparable to organic certification. I have lots of
[28:57.370 --> 29:01.290]  friends and clients who'd be interested in getting that on their product once
[29:01.290 --> 29:04.770]  it's available, because to at least let people know we're doing this as
[29:04.770 --> 29:08.330]  organically as possible, even though we can't actually use that word under the
[29:08.330 --> 29:14.850]  rules. And so, you know, a lot of these same challenges have been shared. And my
[29:14.850 --> 29:19.490]  law office is a small office to we're a small business. There's, you know, three
[29:19.490 --> 29:25.450]  attorneys and some support staff. And so I feel that we've been pretty good at
[29:25.450 --> 29:28.930]  being nimble and adjusting to the working from home environment and things
[29:28.930 --> 29:33.370]  like that, you know, maybe more so than some of the bigger firms are that are
[29:33.370 --> 29:38.130]  doing lots of layoffs and whatnot right now. So that is, you know, just some
[29:38.130 --> 29:43.410]  kind of observations. You know, for all these businesses right now, they're going
[29:43.410 --> 29:48.770]  to have to make some adjustments going forward. And that's just whether it's
[29:48.770 --> 29:53.450]  cannabis or not. And so it's important that we work together as a community to
[29:53.450 --> 30:00.010]  provide assistance to each other. And I think it's in in terms of other small
[30:00.010 --> 30:05.930]  operators, it's in other small operators interest if there's, if it doesn't just
[30:05.970 --> 30:09.970]  become a situation that's dominated by the big players, right. And I think
[30:09.970 --> 30:14.610]  something that really makes California's cannabis culture unique is how many
[30:14.610 --> 30:18.970]  different farmers there are and producers and the history, just like Eric
[30:18.970 --> 30:23.050]  and his legacy strains. There's so many I love the name of your company. There's
[30:23.050 --> 30:28.050]  so many legacy operators out there that have that have made, you know, the
[30:28.050 --> 30:32.170]  cannabis culture what it is today. So I'm hoping they're able to survive this. I
[30:32.170 --> 30:35.970]  think there's both pluses and minuses, you know, I guess plus side being more
[30:35.970 --> 30:40.210]  nimble than a bigger company. But the negative side is a lot of times these
[30:40.210 --> 30:44.170]  smaller mom and pops don't have access to the same funding that the bigger
[30:44.170 --> 30:47.850]  companies do. And so that can make it a little more challenging to pivot in
[30:47.850 --> 30:52.410]  times like this. But we'll see. I've got my fingers crossed.
[30:53.530 --> 30:58.450]  Okay, so my takeaway from what you just said is that I should go into a
[30:58.450 --> 31:03.690]  dispensary and buy weed from an out of state MSO, multi-state operator. I
[31:03.690 --> 31:12.970]  should go support them. So I was a joke. So just quickly, two questions for both
[31:12.970 --> 31:21.250]  of you. Well, accounts payables has come up kind of operator chatter. And are
[31:21.250 --> 31:28.010]  both of you seen? Obviously, cash on demand or on delivery would be nice, but
[31:28.010 --> 31:33.250]  that's not always the case. So are you Lauren across your client base? Are you
[31:33.250 --> 31:38.650]  seeing more kind of delinquent, you know, accounts payables and either farmers or
[31:38.650 --> 31:42.810]  distributors or brands or retailers being like, where's maybe not the
[31:42.810 --> 31:48.050]  retailers, but where's my money? When am I going to get paid? Because obviously
[31:48.050 --> 31:52.850]  that puts a crunch on a business when when you know someone owes you money and
[31:52.850 --> 31:58.850]  you're relying on that cash. So that's for both of you. And then Eric, just
[31:58.850 --> 32:05.890]  quickly, I did it. If you're doing 300 pounds a year, that's about averaging 25
[32:05.890 --> 32:10.370]  pounds per year, 12 strains, right? I mean, obviously, some you grow more, some
[32:10.370 --> 32:16.650]  you grow less, but the minimum size for testing is 50. So you're just kind of
[32:16.650 --> 32:23.050]  sucking up the cost of testing small batches, right? So let's let's start with
[32:23.050 --> 32:27.970]  the accounts payable. But and then we can get on to the batch size. Lauren, what are
[32:27.970 --> 32:31.370]  you seeing with your clients? Or is anybody frustrated that people aren't
[32:31.370 --> 32:36.450]  paying them? Yes, lots of people are frustrated. There is a lot of this
[32:36.450 --> 32:43.770]  happening. Just like you said, lots of bills going unpaid and folks getting not
[32:43.770 --> 32:49.010]  what they thought that they had agreed to. And it's definitely it is really a
[32:49.010 --> 32:54.130]  problem. And it doesn't just extend to the businesses, it extends to ancillary
[32:54.130 --> 32:59.210]  businesses and whatnot. The whole system is kind of waiting to get paid because
[32:59.210 --> 33:03.050]  they're waiting for someone else to pay them. And it's, I think it's pretty
[33:03.050 --> 33:08.210]  unsustainable. I think that there's some structural changes, obviously, that need
[33:08.210 --> 33:14.170]  happen for that to get fixed. And I also think that at least, you know, for for our
[33:14.170 --> 33:17.290]  clients, you know, it's important that when you are entering into these
[33:17.290 --> 33:21.890]  agreements with your suppliers or your producers, that you have some terms in
[33:21.890 --> 33:26.930]  the contract that give some parameters as to when payment has to be made, right.
[33:27.250 --> 33:33.930]  And there can be a range. But it is important that you have a system down for
[33:33.930 --> 33:38.650]  when you need to get paid and what happens if you don't get paid. And there's
[33:38.650 --> 33:42.050]  a lot of folks that are involved in handshake deals. And that gets pretty
[33:42.050 --> 33:44.050]  fuzzy in those circumstances.
[33:44.650 --> 33:51.050]  Can you give some examples of good good clauses you would have in that when to
[33:51.050 --> 33:54.850]  expect payment section of the agreement?
[33:56.730 --> 34:01.130]  Well, it's going to depend right on on what type of contract it is, whether it's
[34:01.130 --> 34:06.450]  between a cultivator and the manufacturer, or if it's between a distributor and a
[34:06.450 --> 34:13.170]  retailer. And it based on the parties, obviously, they can change that. However,
[34:13.170 --> 34:17.890]  if the payment isn't made, you know, immediately, right at the time of delivery,
[34:18.730 --> 34:23.250]  then I would say there needs to be some kind of metric measured in either days or
[34:23.250 --> 34:29.010]  weeks. One payment has to be made by and if it's not made by that date, then there's
[34:29.010 --> 34:32.370]  going to be some penalties that kick in or maybe the contract is going to get
[34:32.370 --> 34:36.650]  rescinded. It's hard to say there's no one size fits all approach. But really, the
[34:36.650 --> 34:42.770]  key is you have to have something in concrete terms of a date, whether it's a
[34:42.770 --> 34:47.450]  specific date or a range. And if payment is not made, then there has to be some
[34:47.450 --> 34:51.290]  consequence that happens. Otherwise, people are just not going to pay and they're
[34:51.290 --> 34:53.450]  going to think they're going to able to get away with that.
[34:54.450 --> 35:01.410]  In the specific licensed categories of operators, where are you seeing the most
[35:01.410 --> 35:07.530]  uptick in delinquent payments? Is it distributors to farmers? Is it distributors
[35:07.530 --> 35:12.450]  to brands? Is it retailers to distributors? Is it kind of where are you noticing the
[35:12.450 --> 35:13.810]  uptick the most?
[35:16.730 --> 35:23.370]  I probably cultivators not getting paid by distributors is what I'm seeing the most
[35:23.370 --> 35:27.010]  but I've seen it in different circumstances.
[35:27.770 --> 35:32.810]  Got it. And Eric, does anyone owe you money right now?
[35:34.450 --> 35:42.650]  Yeah, nothing that's so outside of the norm that I'm concerned about getting paid.
[35:42.690 --> 35:50.450]  But this is another instance where I have the benefit of being a smaller company is
[35:50.570 --> 35:56.690]  good. And you know, funny enough, Lauren is an attorney will hate this because I am
[35:56.810 --> 36:02.210]  totally a handshake guy because I've been in this forever. And most of the shops I'm
[36:02.210 --> 36:07.770]  with, a lot of them I've known the owners for 10 plus years, because back in the mid
[36:07.770 --> 36:12.650]  2000s, I protested in front of half of their shops when they're getting DEA rates. So I
[36:12.650 --> 36:14.850]  just, I have great personal relationships.
[36:14.970 --> 36:19.850]  Just quickly, can you give a shout out to some of your favorite shops? You want to give
[36:19.850 --> 36:21.330]  any shops some love?
[36:21.810 --> 36:29.530]  Yeah, yeah. My alma mater where I worked for nine years, LAPCG. And you know, going away
[36:29.530 --> 36:34.930]  from the handshake, Showgirl Long Beach, love that shop. They have a great staff. The
[36:34.930 --> 36:41.330]  Sweet Flower shops where one of my best friends became a senior buyer there. And I love
[36:41.370 --> 36:47.970]  the vibe of their shops. Yeah, let's, let's, let's go with those. Oh, Malibu 99 Hightide's a
[36:47.970 --> 36:55.930]  great shop as well. They go way back. You know, and Chai Cannabis. See, everyone at Herb
[36:55.930 --> 37:02.210]  Delivery as well. Goddess Delivers. I do a lot of political work with them. Yeah. Shout
[37:02.210 --> 37:08.330]  outs, shout outs to every shop that carries legacy. Pretty much with terms, it's every
[37:09.170 --> 37:14.890]  Pretty much with terms, it's everything, everything these days is is net 30. You know, and
[37:14.890 --> 37:19.850]  part of that is the shops still have quite a bit of leverage because every day a shop is
[37:19.850 --> 37:25.930]  going to have 10 different salespeople trying to generate new accounts of the shop. And so
[37:25.970 --> 37:31.330]  from purchasing manager standpoint, it's just, you know, it's just a cattle call every single
[37:31.330 --> 37:38.610]  day. And so being a salesperson doing cold calls at cannabis shops is just, it's just a
[37:38.610 --> 37:43.410]  really brutal occupation. It's just, you got to be able to deal with rejection after
[37:43.410 --> 37:50.850]  rejection after rejection. And so part of part of what makes it tough is if your net 30
[37:50.850 --> 37:57.090]  start to come late, you know, you, you have to be very careful how much of a fuss you put up
[37:57.090 --> 38:01.690]  about it. Cause if you start putting up too much of a fuss about it, a lot of shops are just
[38:01.690 --> 38:05.410]  gonna, you know, they're just going to decide to stop carrying your product and go with
[38:05.410 --> 38:09.890]  somebody else. I mean, it's not so much an issue with me, but I do know it's an issue with, with
[38:09.890 --> 38:14.530]  a lot of other brands that just really need to be in every shop. And so when that happens as
[38:14.530 --> 38:19.770]  well, you know, when, when a lot of these big defaults, you know, that I have friends with
[38:19.770 --> 38:26.490]  companies that have had six, six figure bills that were owed by shops that, you know, I, you
[38:26.490 --> 38:30.170]  know, they're trying to figure out if they're ever getting it back and, you know, throwing in
[38:30.170 --> 38:32.650]  the lack of bankruptcy.
[38:32.650 --> 38:39.770]  Is that, is that one shop that owes them six figures or in aggregate, they're owed six figures by a
[38:39.770 --> 38:40.730]  bunch of shops?
[38:43.210 --> 38:52.170]  I hate calling anybody out. So I will merely say that it was a large chain that offered them
[38:52.170 --> 38:53.930]  stock for their consignment debt.
[38:53.930 --> 38:54.930]  Wow.
[38:54.930 --> 39:01.930]  Can I say a company name and you can blink if I guess correctly? Medmen?
[39:01.930 --> 39:07.930]  See what, all right. I just, see what I did?
[39:07.930 --> 39:08.930]  Carry on.
[39:08.930 --> 39:09.930]  The eyes don't lie.
[39:09.930 --> 39:11.930]  Yeah, yeah, you know, I...
[39:11.930 --> 39:17.930]  Can you talk about the actual mechanics of getting paid? Do you get paid directly from the
[39:17.930 --> 39:21.930]  retailer or it goes through the distributor? So how exactly do you get paid?
[39:21.930 --> 39:24.930]  It goes through the distributor. So how exactly does that work?
[39:24.930 --> 39:31.930]  It goes to the distributor. So I don't actually get paid. If I did get paid, I would be on the
[39:31.930 --> 39:36.930]  hook for paying tax on the excise tax, which is a whole nother thing distributors have to go
[39:36.930 --> 39:38.930]  through. But no, it goes to my distributor.
[39:38.930 --> 39:43.930]  Do you have a single distributor or a couple distributors?
[39:43.930 --> 39:47.930]  I have a single distributor. I'm distributed through the same company that distributes THC
[39:47.930 --> 39:48.930]  Design.
[39:51.650 --> 39:54.650]  Okay. And what company is that?
[39:54.650 --> 40:04.650]  They are 1346 LLC. But yeah, that's, that's a company that distributes THC Design. You
[40:04.650 --> 40:11.650]  know, I go way back. The owners of THC Designs are really good friends of mine. We've been
[40:11.650 --> 40:16.650]  doing political work together for six years, you know, and that's the benefit is, you know,
[40:16.650 --> 40:20.650]  and another thing like Lauren was saying with small businesses, one of the things we have
[40:20.650 --> 40:25.650]  with small businesses, I know THC Designs is, seems like a big business, but I mean,
[40:25.650 --> 40:29.650]  it's, they're, they're a mom and pop too. They started, they started from absolutely
[40:29.650 --> 40:35.650]  nothing and they grew themselves self-funded to what they are today, you know? So they're
[40:35.650 --> 40:39.650]  not like outside money. They're not a Canadian fund company or anything like that. They're
[40:39.650 --> 40:45.650]  a independent company. And so one of the advantages, I think that a lot of independent
[40:45.650 --> 40:50.650]  companies have more so is that we're really plugged into the cannabis community. And
[40:50.650 --> 40:56.650]  I think the cannabis community does treat their own much differently because we've always
[40:56.650 --> 41:04.650]  kind of been a bit of a, you know, counterculture group. And so I think we kind of stick together
[41:04.650 --> 41:09.650]  because we all have this counterculture nature to it. And so I think when people who don't
[41:10.650 --> 41:15.650]  necessarily share those same counterculture ideas come into it, you know, we kind of can
[41:15.650 --> 41:19.650]  spot them. And I think a lot of the small, the small operators are here because we love
[41:19.650 --> 41:24.650]  cannabis and we love the scene and we love the industry and people who are into it. And
[41:24.650 --> 41:30.650]  so I think we kind of just naturally bond together as kindred spirits. And so I think
[41:30.650 --> 41:35.650]  the way we relate to each other is much different than relating to people coming in from Wall
[41:36.650 --> 41:40.650]  Street or anywhere else. You know, anybody wants to get into a great, I don't mean to
[41:40.650 --> 41:46.650]  be disparaging people coming in from Wall Street or a Canadian fund, but you know, some
[41:46.650 --> 41:50.650]  of them remind me of people that used to make fun of me and my friends for smoking weed
[41:50.650 --> 41:55.650]  at high school, you know, and now here they are, you know, like, you know, they used to
[41:55.650 --> 42:01.650]  call us losers and now they're running companies in our space and some of us are like, okay.
[42:02.650 --> 42:11.650]  So what do you do with an up and coming retail brand like High Times, which obviously is
[42:11.650 --> 42:17.650]  an old school, like legacy brand, but is now also a big corporate player. Are you going
[42:17.650 --> 42:20.650]  to have a fuzzy relationship with those retailers?
[42:22.650 --> 42:27.650]  No, I mean, you know, again, I'm a customer service person. And one thing you do in customer
[42:28.650 --> 42:33.650]  service is you never talk poorly about your customer. And these shops are my customers.
[42:33.650 --> 42:44.650]  If it's run by High Times, if you know, if, I don't know, let's say Dick Cheney decides
[42:44.650 --> 42:48.650]  to buy some cannabis shops or no, let's say John Boehner, because he invested in the space
[42:48.650 --> 42:53.650]  already. If they're a customer, they're going to be a paying customer. It really does you
[42:53.650 --> 42:58.650]  no good to disparage them or talk poorly about them. You know, even the larger companies
[42:58.650 --> 43:04.650]  who, you know, we may or may not have alluded to before, you know, that a lot of them have
[43:04.650 --> 43:08.650]  been customers of mine in the past and they have great people working there. And, you
[43:08.650 --> 43:11.650]  know, when you look at it, the ground floor, no matter who owns a company, when you go
[43:11.650 --> 43:15.650]  into a shop and you deal with the bud tenders, those are the same cannabis people that we've
[43:15.650 --> 43:21.650]  always had, you know? So as far as, as far as for myself, like I would love every single
[43:21.650 --> 43:26.650]  cannabis shop, no matter who owns it, to take a look at my brand and consider carrying
[43:26.650 --> 43:31.650]  it. Like I would hate for somebody to not like my brand because of some egotistical
[43:31.650 --> 43:36.650]  reason or political reason or anything like that. You know, it's, it's just good to value,
[43:36.650 --> 43:40.650]  you have to value your customers no matter who they are or else you're not going to have
[43:40.650 --> 43:41.650]  a business.
[43:41.650 --> 43:46.650]  You mentioned kind of getting an investment. So, so you haven't taken on any outside funding
[43:46.650 --> 43:50.650]  beyond either yourself or maybe even just some family or friends, correct?
[43:51.650 --> 43:56.650]  Yeah, I have a, I have a partner who I started with back in 2014 that, you know, we worked
[43:56.650 --> 44:00.650]  at our, our first space, but yeah, I mean short of that and that's just an independent
[44:00.650 --> 44:05.650]  one. And a lot of it was my savings that I built up. I started growing in 2006. I grew
[44:05.650 --> 44:11.650]  in a spare bedroom while I worked at a dispensary. And then I had a buddy who moved to Colorado
[44:11.650 --> 44:16.650]  from a loft downtown. I took over that. And then I took over a garage in Sherman Oak.
[44:16.650 --> 44:22.650]  And at one point I had three residential cultivations going on and at about 2013 I
[44:22.650 --> 44:27.650]  was ready to jump up to a industrial space. And so I did and I wound down those spots
[44:27.650 --> 44:34.650]  and, and yeah, but otherwise so far we've taken on no, no investing. We've just bootstrapped
[44:34.650 --> 44:35.650]  it.
[44:35.650 --> 44:41.650]  Got it. So, so getting back to the question I had thrown out there before about, you know,
[44:41.650 --> 44:50.650]  300 pounds a year, 12 cultivars, which breaks down to about 25 pounds per cultivar. Which
[44:50.650 --> 44:55.650]  means that you're, you're not, cause I know a lot of people who, you know, you'd love
[44:55.650 --> 45:03.650]  to grow something random in a small batch and get it out there, but then you're hammered
[45:03.650 --> 45:07.650]  with testing fees. And so unless you're growing at least 50 pounds of it, it doesn't make
[45:07.650 --> 45:14.650]  sense, but you're, you're sending 25 pound or even maybe 15 pound batches out to get
[45:14.650 --> 45:20.650]  tested. And, and what, what are you paying for a test? What lab do you use?
[45:20.650 --> 45:28.650]  Well, my, so my distributor handle handles all the testing and since they're such a high
[45:28.650 --> 45:35.650]  volume distributor, we do get, we do get pretty, pretty good prices on it. But our average
[45:35.650 --> 45:41.650]  batch size, we tend to do split rooms. So yeah, we, we do batches of like 12 pounds
[45:41.650 --> 45:47.650]  at a time, which is definitely brutal. It really, it really cuts into our, cuts into
[45:47.650 --> 45:52.650]  our margins. Occasionally, some of our strains we'll do full rooms of, and then we'll end
[45:52.650 --> 45:57.650]  up with about 20 pounds of it, which is much nicer. But yeah, lab, lab testing eats up
[45:57.650 --> 46:02.650]  a big chunk of money from us, you know, just again, because we do a smaller thing. And
[46:02.650 --> 46:07.650]  part of the reason for that as well is because I do the sales. So if I'm growing in my whole
[46:07.650 --> 46:14.650]  facility, two, two types, that means that I'm going to have to have 40 accounts. You
[46:14.650 --> 46:21.650]  know, if I grow five types, then I can drop that down, down considerably because instead
[46:21.650 --> 46:27.650]  of taking a half pound a time at my one variety, they'll take a half pound of four different
[46:27.650 --> 46:34.650]  varieties. And so it's just less, it's less sales work for me to do. I think if I really
[46:34.650 --> 46:38.650]  only grew one type and I grew larger batches, I would probably have to spend that money
[46:38.650 --> 46:44.650]  on one or two more outside sales people to reach the extra shops that I, that I could
[46:44.650 --> 46:45.650]  get.
[46:45.650 --> 46:51.050]  Got it. Do you wholesale any of your, of your product?
[46:51.050 --> 46:56.050]  No, no, we don't wholesale. Everything is, everything is packaged and branded. We don't
[46:56.050 --> 46:58.050]  do any wholesaling or white labeling.
[46:59.050 --> 47:07.050]  Because we had just heard recently from, actually it was Greg who said that he was actually
[47:07.050 --> 47:14.050]  making more money wholesaling than putting his product on his own shelves. That that
[47:14.050 --> 47:18.050]  was the strength of the bulk market for him.
[47:18.050 --> 47:25.050]  Or it was the lunacy of the, of the tax and all this stuff he had to pay just to create
[47:25.050 --> 47:28.050]  his own, put it in his own brand in.
[47:28.050 --> 47:29.050]  Yeah.
[47:29.050 --> 47:37.050]  Yeah. The, the, the bulk, the bulk market is really, has really strong prices right
[47:37.050 --> 47:42.050]  now. I'm not really sure why or what it is about this, but over the last few months,
[47:42.050 --> 47:49.050]  definitely the bulk prices have really, have really been strong. And this, this would be
[47:49.050 --> 47:54.050]  a whole other issue for somebody else other than me to tell you why, but, but it's definitely,
[47:54.050 --> 47:55.050]  it's definitely happening.
[47:55.050 --> 48:03.050]  But does that play a role in, in your future plans at all? Like if you were to expand,
[48:03.050 --> 48:10.050]  I mean, how do you see that part of it? If it continues to be a strong market, he's,
[48:10.050 --> 48:16.050]  he's a great Prince's is selling to a very well-known brand, which I'm not going to say
[48:16.050 --> 48:21.050]  really well known. And for a consumer, that's just, you know, for someone like me walking
[48:21.050 --> 48:25.050]  into that shop, it's kind of telling me, I don't know necessarily what I'm getting,
[48:25.050 --> 48:32.050]  but, but that aside there's no reason necessarily believe that the strength of that bulk market
[48:32.050 --> 48:38.050]  is going to necessarily go away because demand seems to be there.
[48:38.050 --> 48:47.050]  Yeah. I, I'm pretty torn on this. I do think that the most successful operating model would
[48:47.050 --> 48:54.050]  involve you selling 100% of what you produce under your own brand. Cause otherwise if I'm,
[48:54.050 --> 49:00.050]  if I'm selling bulk to somebody, they're paying bulk for that. And then they're doing additional
[49:00.050 --> 49:06.050]  things on top of that, which is going to increase their cost, you know? And, and also as more
[49:06.050 --> 49:12.050]  operators or more facilities come online, I think, especially larger ones, you're going
[49:12.050 --> 49:17.050]  to find that the bulk market is one that's going to be much more subject to general commodity
[49:17.050 --> 49:23.050]  prices, you know, like with, with everything looking at this, you have, you know, your,
[49:23.050 --> 49:26.050]  your crude oil price and you need to hear of your gasoline price, which is your finished
[49:26.050 --> 49:31.050]  refined product. And both of these markets are impacted by each other, but they're also
[49:31.050 --> 49:36.050]  both a little bit separate. You know, your refining capacity is going to dictate your
[49:36.050 --> 49:41.050]  gas price. Just like the bulk price of crude oil is, you know, they're not necessarily
[49:41.050 --> 49:47.050]  in a vacuum. And so having everything going out and branded, you can control what you're
[49:47.050 --> 49:52.050]  getting. But if, if 50% of your inventory, you have to bulk price, if there's a glut
[49:52.050 --> 49:57.050]  in the market and the bulk price drops to 1100 a pound, all of a sudden, all of a sudden
[49:57.050 --> 50:03.050]  half of what you're selling, you're, you're probably losing money at, or you're not making
[50:03.050 --> 50:09.050]  anything. If the price is say strong 18 to 2000, which is where they are now, then, then
[50:09.050 --> 50:15.050]  you're doing fine. But you know, with anything else, if, if there's, if there's a space for
[50:15.050 --> 50:20.050]  somebody to come in and occupy, because you know, if it's costing everybody a thousand
[50:20.050 --> 50:24.050]  bucks to grow a pound, but everybody's getting 1800 on it with that markup, more people are
[50:24.050 --> 50:29.050]  going to fill that space and produce those pounds until all of a sudden you have overcapacity
[50:29.050 --> 50:33.050]  and then the prices are going to crash. And then when they hit 11, the inefficient people
[50:33.050 --> 50:37.050]  are going to pack up shop and it's going to be cyclical. But if you're selling your product
[50:37.050 --> 50:42.050]  to consumers, you're kind of immune from all that because you're just getting your
[50:42.050 --> 50:49.050]  wholesale price per package date. So that's the place to be. I think relying on bulk
[50:49.050 --> 50:54.050]  wholesales as a business model is playing with fire or a hot potato. It's going to work
[50:54.050 --> 50:58.050]  out sometimes, but there's going to be times it doesn't work and you're going to have to
[50:58.050 --> 51:03.050]  figure out how to adjust to that. But I think most people relying on bulk are trying to
[51:03.050 --> 51:08.050]  figure out how to get a larger percentage into retail as fast as they can, which maybe
[51:08.050 --> 51:13.050]  that's part of why we're seeing some downward pressure on wholesale prices in package goods
[51:13.050 --> 51:14.050]  versus bulk.
[51:14.050 --> 51:22.050]  I was just going to ask you what your projections are for kind of, let's say, end of 2020 spot
[51:22.050 --> 51:29.050]  market pricing for per pound on both the regulated market and then what are your friends in the
[51:29.050 --> 51:36.050]  traditional market telling you? Is it la dolce vita? Is life good right now?
[51:38.050 --> 51:45.050]  I mean, I don't have a lot of friends outside in the traditional market anymore.
[51:46.050 --> 51:51.050]  Your friends are all masochists. They all like the pain of getting into the regulated market.
[51:52.050 --> 51:57.050]  You know, I guess the people in the traditional market are too busy going on exotic vacations
[51:57.050 --> 52:02.050]  around the world, whereas I'm just eating ramen and bitching about it with my regulated
[52:02.050 --> 52:03.050]  market friends.
[52:04.050 --> 52:06.050]  I don't know if they're doing that now.
[52:08.050 --> 52:14.050]  So do you think in the regulated market, the per pound prices, you know, obviously you
[52:14.050 --> 52:20.050]  have like top shelf, mids, whatever, but do you think on average prices are going to go
[52:20.050 --> 52:25.050]  up at the end of the year? Do you see more farms coming online and prices going down
[52:25.050 --> 52:26.050]  by the end of the year?
[52:26.050 --> 52:33.050]  The prices are so strong right now on wholesale. I don't see how it could last till the end
[52:33.050 --> 52:39.050]  of the year. I mean, if it does, I'll be mildly surprised. I guess I won't be totally shocked
[52:39.050 --> 52:43.050]  by it, but I mean, the prices are really, really strong right now.
[52:44.050 --> 52:51.050]  Like give me ballpark pricing that you're seeing for pounds of, you know, different
[52:51.050 --> 52:52.050]  caliber flour.
[52:53.050 --> 52:59.050]  Of top shelf. And you know, my knowledge is indoor, the greenhouse stuff.
[53:00.050 --> 53:04.050]  So let's do indoor, top shelf, indoor. What's the per pound price?
[53:04.050 --> 53:11.050]  I have multiple friends with brands. Yeah. About $2,000 COD for bulk pounds right now
[53:11.050 --> 53:18.050]  of good quality stuff. You know, good testing. You know, we're talking like 25% plus THC.
[53:19.050 --> 53:24.050]  Like your top shelf bulk is going for 2000, sometimes 2100 pounds COD.
[53:24.050 --> 53:31.050]  I have even heard of distributors pre-paying for future harvests that haven't even come
[53:31.050 --> 53:34.050]  down yet. That's how hot the market is right now. And I've never heard of that.
[53:35.050 --> 53:40.050]  And what was it a year ago? That same $2,000 pound? Was it?
[53:40.050 --> 53:41.050]  14.
[53:41.050 --> 53:42.050]  Okay.
[53:42.050 --> 53:52.050]  14 and growers calling me asking if I knew buyers. Now it's brokers calling me asking
[53:52.050 --> 54:00.050]  me if I can track down any pounds out there, you know? And yeah, and this happened about
[54:00.050 --> 54:05.050]  three weeks ago, a month ago. I had somebody call me who I used to know, somebody who I
[54:05.050 --> 54:10.050]  never thought I would hear from again, calling me asking if I could find them any farms that
[54:10.050 --> 54:16.050]  had any top shelf in flour. And that's when I was like, what is going on here? You know,
[54:16.050 --> 54:20.050]  and I still really don't know, but I just know the market's really hot right now on
[54:20.050 --> 54:25.050]  the bulk wholesale. And I just don't know. I don't know how it can keep up like this.
[54:25.050 --> 54:26.050]  Right.
[54:27.050 --> 54:34.050]  So for both of you, and let's start with you, Lauren. I thought it'd be interesting as
[54:34.050 --> 54:43.050]  we bring people on, if people can give an example of a situation where you had to educate
[54:43.050 --> 54:52.050]  either a local or state regulator, politician on some topic, or you had a friend or someone
[54:52.050 --> 54:56.050]  who's, you know, Lauren, you're a lawyer. So you, you heard of it. You talked to another
[54:56.050 --> 55:01.050]  lawyer who had to educate someone on something. What, give me an example of something where
[55:01.050 --> 55:06.050]  you had to educate or, you know, someone who had to educate either a local or state
[55:06.050 --> 55:13.050]  politician regulator on some topic related to cannabis so that they could be sensible
[55:13.050 --> 55:16.050]  with their policies and regulations.
[55:17.050 --> 55:24.050]  Yeah, I've got a recent example of that. Talking about the shelter in place orders
[55:24.050 --> 55:31.050]  that went down for coronavirus in Sonoma County, where I'm, where I live and where
[55:31.050 --> 55:38.050]  my office is located. The county's original shelter in place order when it was defining
[55:38.050 --> 55:44.050]  what's an essential business and what's not an essential business. The first version of
[55:44.050 --> 55:52.050]  it said that medical cannabis operators were essential, but it implied that anyone that
[55:52.050 --> 56:00.050]  didn't have a medical license wasn't included. And it also said that effectively like testing
[56:00.050 --> 56:06.050]  labs were not essential unless they were testing cannabis that was destined for a medical
[56:06.050 --> 56:11.050]  facility. And so I read that and I was like, there's no way, that's not how this works.
[56:11.050 --> 56:15.050]  There's, you know, you're when you're in the lab is testing products. They don't always
[56:15.050 --> 56:19.050]  know what facility is going to be selling it. The labs themselves aren't designated
[56:19.050 --> 56:24.050]  as medical or adult use. They're also not, they're not really, they're not growing the
[56:24.050 --> 56:28.050]  plant, producing the plant, anything. They're doing something that's a purely, you know,
[56:28.050 --> 56:34.050]  testing health and safety, you know, function. And I had no idea why the county had written
[56:34.050 --> 56:38.050]  their health order that way. And so I reached out to the health department and I mean, it
[56:38.050 --> 56:43.050]  turned out that the county just had no idea how cannabis testing labs worked. And, you
[56:43.050 --> 56:48.050]  know, I think they thought that maybe they were affiliated with a dispensary or something
[56:48.050 --> 56:52.050]  like that, or that all the products came in with a big label that said, this is going
[56:52.050 --> 56:55.050]  to be for a medical user. This is not going to be for a medical user. And once I explained,
[56:55.050 --> 57:00.050]  you know, that's just not how it works. I would, you know, I was able to get the county
[57:00.050 --> 57:05.050]  to revise their shelter in place order to make it clear that all cannabis testing labs
[57:05.050 --> 57:08.050]  in the county are essential businesses and can stay open no matter what they're testing
[57:08.050 --> 57:14.050]  and that all cannabis businesses, no matter whether they're medical or adult use are essential
[57:15.050 --> 57:20.050]  and can stay open because not every person that uses cannabis, a lot of people use cannabis
[57:20.050 --> 57:26.050]  in what really is a medical way, but don't consider themselves a patient or don't have
[57:26.050 --> 57:31.050]  a medical card. And so they shouldn't be excluded from, you know, the ability to use those
[57:31.050 --> 57:36.050]  services and those businesses that employ local people shouldn't have to shut down just
[57:36.050 --> 57:40.050]  because the county is, you know, misconception. And so anyway, I talked with them about all
[57:41.050 --> 57:46.050]  that and I was able to get them to amend the shelter in place order. So, but it needed
[57:46.050 --> 57:50.050]  education. It was people who are making these rules don't really understand how the industry
[57:50.050 --> 57:55.050]  works, don't understand the supply chain and all the intricacies of it. I think the whole
[57:55.050 --> 58:01.050]  medical versus adult use designation really has, it's has, it creates some problems like
[58:01.050 --> 58:06.050]  this where we're creating, you know, two separate categories of buyers and don't get me wrong.
[58:06.050 --> 58:10.050]  There are some people that absolutely are medical patients and they deserve to be, you
[58:10.050 --> 58:14.050]  know, I think prioritized above people that are just trying to get high, but even the
[58:14.050 --> 58:17.050]  people that are just trying to get high, if they're doing it because it's calming them
[58:17.050 --> 58:22.050]  down because like for me, I have bad anxiety, it helps my anxiety. That's a medical use.
[58:22.050 --> 58:27.050]  I mean, I might take Xanax for that instead and I'm not. And so I think we need to rethink,
[58:27.050 --> 58:33.050]  you know, what we think of as medical use and just, and educate lawmakers about exactly
[58:33.050 --> 58:34.050]  that.
[58:36.050 --> 58:44.050]  And Eric, do you have an example down in SoCal of having to sit someone down and teach them
[58:44.050 --> 58:45.050]  something?
[58:48.050 --> 58:54.050]  You know, a lot of that was more, you know, my nine years behind the counter as a bud
[58:54.050 --> 58:59.050]  tender, there was plenty of education on that and misconception to kind of speak into what
[58:59.050 --> 59:06.050]  Lauren was talking about as well. Like I a hundred percent agree that people use cannabis,
[59:06.050 --> 59:11.050]  you know, if not medicinally, it's to improve a quality of life, which I would consider
[59:11.050 --> 59:18.050]  therapeutic at the very least. And, you know, there's, I think times where, you know, it's
[59:18.050 --> 59:23.050]  important for people not to judge other people. And like with cannabis at the shop, sometimes
[59:23.050 --> 59:29.050]  people will come in and some people were more obviously disabilitated than others.
[59:29.050 --> 59:34.050]  And this is, you know, going back in the mid 2000s when it was much more strict on the
[59:34.050 --> 59:40.050]  medical. And I remember there was a older lady in line and, you know, she had like a
[59:40.050 --> 59:45.050]  walker and she had a younger kid in front of her, you know, very urban looking with
[59:45.050 --> 59:49.050]  the, you know, flat rim baseball cap, all of that. And telling, there was a big line
[59:49.050 --> 59:53.050]  telling him that he should let her go in front of her because she was sicker than he
[59:53.050 --> 59:59.050]  was obviously. And I remember this kid lifted up his shirt and he was just multiple surgeries
[59:59.050 --> 01:00:05.050]  and just zippers up and down from everything he had. And it's just kind of like, you can't
[01:00:05.050 --> 01:00:10.050]  really judge somebody by looking at them as well, you know, and this is something we would
[01:00:10.050 --> 01:00:15.050]  deal with law enforcement back then who would basically say medical cannabis is a scam.
[01:00:15.050 --> 01:00:19.050]  These people are just scamming it. They're not really sick, you know, and they would
[01:00:19.050 --> 01:00:23.050]  say things like we parked outside of a shop and watch people walk in and out. None of
[01:00:23.050 --> 01:00:27.050]  them looked very sick. And this is in West Hollywood, you know, and my question is like,
[01:00:27.050 --> 01:00:31.050]  how do you know from looking at somebody if they're an AIDS patient or a cancer patient?
[01:00:31.050 --> 01:00:37.050]  I mean, short of having just done chemo, you know, so I really think with that a lot of
[01:00:37.050 --> 01:00:42.050]  it is, you know, what are the reasons people really use cannabis? And I think it comes
[01:00:42.050 --> 01:00:47.050]  down to it at the end, it's really therapeutic and it improves the quality of life. And to
[01:00:47.050 --> 01:00:55.050]  me, having something chemically that can help improve your quality of life is a medicinal
[01:00:55.050 --> 01:00:59.050]  use, you know, and I do think a lot of that does get shortchanged. And, you know, I, even
[01:00:59.050 --> 01:01:05.050]  myself, I, you know, I talk, I talk a bit about stoner culture and things like that
[01:01:05.050 --> 01:01:09.050]  because that's there as well. But I, but I think deep down, we're all using it to improve
[01:01:09.050 --> 01:01:13.050]  our quality of life. And so I guess that's, that's how I'd answer it.
[01:01:14.050 --> 01:01:21.050]  Okay. So Lauren, can you talk about something you guys are working on behind the scenes
[01:01:21.050 --> 01:01:31.050]  that maybe is related to or requires a legislative change and then, and or something that is
[01:01:31.050 --> 01:01:41.050]  is more regulatory, like the BCC, CDFA or CDPH can change without requiring legislative
[01:01:41.050 --> 01:01:42.050]  change?
[01:01:43.050 --> 01:01:51.050]  Yeah, I mean, at the, at the state level, you know, we have reached out individually
[01:01:51.050 --> 01:01:57.050]  to our state lawmakers and asked them to support tax relief bills, because that's something
[01:01:57.050 --> 01:02:02.050]  you know, that's going to require a legislative fix. And so I do encourage everyone to keep
[01:02:02.050 --> 01:02:08.050]  putting pressure on your local state senators and representatives to support cannabis tax
[01:02:08.050 --> 01:02:09.050]  relief measures.
[01:02:10.050 --> 01:02:15.050]  Just quickly on that front. I mean, what's the reception like? I feel like it's about
[01:02:15.050 --> 01:02:23.050]  as obvious as, as you know, the the sun rising in the east that taxes are way too high. Does
[01:02:23.050 --> 01:02:28.050]  the state know that? Like when you talk, like, who are you talking to? And are they
[01:02:28.050 --> 01:02:31.050]  like, yeah, we know taxes are way too high, and it's crippling?
[01:02:31.050 --> 01:02:36.050]  Yeah, I mean, so my interactions for the most part have been kind of with the folks that
[01:02:36.050 --> 01:02:42.050]  represent my area, who are people like Jim Wood and Mike McGuire, folks that are super
[01:02:42.050 --> 01:02:47.050]  on our side. And so they're very much aware of it. I know they are doing what they can
[01:02:47.050 --> 01:02:52.050]  to lead this effort. And I think overall, folks in Sacramento do realize that tax are
[01:02:52.050 --> 01:02:57.050]  way too high. I think we can't look at cannabis in a vacuum, though, we have to realize that
[01:02:57.050 --> 01:03:03.050]  the state is doing a lot of other things too, that require money. And, you know, for which
[01:03:03.050 --> 01:03:08.050]  these taxes are needed these and other taxes. And so lowering taxes is always a tricky
[01:03:08.050 --> 01:03:12.050]  conversation, because that money needs to, that money is being used for stuff, and it's
[01:03:12.050 --> 01:03:15.050]  going to have to come from someplace else, potentially, if they're not getting it from
[01:03:15.050 --> 01:03:20.050]  this industry anymore. And I also think that given the current state of the health
[01:03:20.050 --> 01:03:26.050]  emergency right now, things like requests for cannabis tax relief are, you know, coming
[01:03:26.050 --> 01:03:32.050]  after things like, you know, getting emergency health care and financial relief to
[01:03:32.050 --> 01:03:39.050]  businesses that got shut down. But I think the will is there. I think that maybe next
[01:03:39.050 --> 01:03:46.050]  session, I think once I'm not too sure how likely it is that taxes are going to get,
[01:03:47.050 --> 01:03:51.050]  state taxes are going to get reduced during the pandemic. I can't predict the future. Maybe
[01:03:51.050 --> 01:03:56.050]  that would be wonderful. I'm thinking it might happen kind of once the emergency has
[01:03:56.050 --> 01:04:03.050]  passed us a little bit. However, like I said, anything's possible. There's a, at the
[01:04:03.050 --> 01:04:07.050]  local level, taxes are also a big problem. We haven't really talked about that yet. But
[01:04:07.050 --> 01:04:11.050]  a lot of different cities and counties are also adding their own taxes on top of the
[01:04:11.050 --> 01:04:17.050]  state taxes, which is where, why the tax issue in general is so burdensome. And so
[01:04:17.050 --> 01:04:22.050]  that's certain local governments may be more willing to alter that.
[01:04:22.050 --> 01:04:31.050]  Is Sonoma, and I don't know if it's just count, like what's your, is, are you just
[01:04:31.050 --> 01:04:40.050]  Sonoma County or are there local jurisdictions as well, like Santa Rosa? Is that its own?
[01:04:41.050 --> 01:04:45.050]  Yes. Santa Rosa has its own cannabis policy and their own set of taxes that are lower
[01:04:45.050 --> 01:04:52.050]  than Sonoma County unincorporated cannabis taxes. And, you know,
[01:04:52.050 --> 01:05:02.050]  And both of those relative to other municipalities, are they reasonable or like is,
[01:05:03.050 --> 01:05:05.050]  Yeah, I would say that,
[01:05:05.050 --> 01:05:11.050]  Is Santa Rosa reasonable and Sonoma County is unreasonable relative to the rest of the state?
[01:05:11.050 --> 01:05:17.050]  Kind of, you know, I would say Santa Rosa is more reasonable than Sonoma County. Sonoma
[01:05:17.050 --> 01:05:24.050]  County, their cultivation tax structure in particular is complicated and it can get very
[01:05:24.050 --> 01:05:28.050]  expensive. You know, it's based on the size of the grow as well as whether it's indoor,
[01:05:28.050 --> 01:05:34.050]  outdoor, mixed light and it can get to be just depend, you know, depending on what you're
[01:05:34.050 --> 01:05:40.050]  doing, it can get very burdensome. And I think it is higher than others. I've seen lower
[01:05:40.050 --> 01:05:46.050]  than some others I've seen. But in terms of just the industry in Sonoma County right now is
[01:05:46.050 --> 01:05:52.050]  really struggling and something that would really help is, is reforming the local taxes as
[01:05:53.050 --> 01:05:57.050]  well as the local permit process here in Sonoma County. That is very onerous. People have put
[01:05:57.050 --> 01:06:02.050]  in applications two, three years ago that haven't gotten to a hearing yet. And it's been
[01:06:02.050 --> 01:06:06.050]  charged more and more money for the county to keep reviewing things and it's been bounced
[01:06:06.050 --> 01:06:11.050]  around to multiple reviewers. And so the county has just some problems with how the program
[01:06:11.050 --> 01:06:18.050]  is working. And my understanding is there are some changes that are going to be made
[01:06:18.050 --> 01:06:24.050]  hopefully in the future that would move things around a bit. The goal is is to try to get
[01:06:24.050 --> 01:06:30.050]  all of cultivation permitted through ag weights and measures rather than the permit resource
[01:06:30.050 --> 01:06:35.050]  management department that handles other types of permits. And so there is an effort
[01:06:35.050 --> 01:06:40.050]  internally and from groups like Sonoma County Growers Alliance and Sonoma, kind of this
[01:06:40.050 --> 01:06:45.050]  business alliance of Sonoma County and some other groups to change how all of that is
[01:06:46.050 --> 01:06:52.050]  done. And within the city of Santa Rosa, I'm not too sure if there's been any talk about, you
[01:06:52.050 --> 01:06:57.050]  know, changing their process. They're pretty efficient within Santa Rosa. They've approved a lot
[01:06:57.050 --> 01:07:03.050]  more cannabis businesses and their taxes seem more reasonable. But how big is that?
[01:07:05.050 --> 01:07:09.050]  The backlog of businesses waiting for permitted weight in your county.
[01:07:09.050 --> 01:07:15.050]  I don't know an exact number, but there's a whole lot. I can get I can get that information and
[01:07:15.050 --> 01:07:20.050]  you know, distribute it to everyone who's interested. But there are a lot of folks that submitted
[01:07:20.050 --> 01:07:29.050]  applications and are waiting to hear back at least probably at least 50, if not more than that,
[01:07:29.050 --> 01:07:33.050]  potentially even like 100 applications that have been filed and haven't really got anywhere, if
[01:07:33.050 --> 01:07:40.050]  not more. And so the county has only permitted a handful of, you know, issued a handful of
[01:07:40.050 --> 01:07:45.050]  conditional use permits for larger sized outdoor grows in the two or three years since the
[01:07:45.050 --> 01:07:50.050]  program's been active. There's a few more smaller permits that have been issued and some permits
[01:07:50.050 --> 01:07:56.050]  for things like manufacturing and distribution. But what's the what's the square footage of
[01:07:56.050 --> 01:07:59.050]  the when you say larger size? How big are we talking?
[01:07:59.050 --> 01:08:06.050]  So the way it is right now, if you have if you're 10,000 square feet or less and you're in an
[01:08:06.050 --> 01:08:11.050]  agriculturally zoned parcel, you can get permitted through the Ag Department. But everything
[01:08:11.050 --> 01:08:18.050]  else, which is 10,001 square feet up to an acre, which is the current cap they have, has to go
[01:08:18.050 --> 01:08:23.050]  through PRMD, the Permit Resource Management Department. And they have just tons of bureaucracy
[01:08:24.050 --> 01:08:29.050]  and they're taking forever. And they their fees are higher, their application process is more
[01:08:29.050 --> 01:08:34.050]  onerous than the folks that have 10,000 square foot or less and are in an ag zone and can just do
[01:08:34.050 --> 01:08:40.050]  it through the Ag Department. And so the the idea is to just bring all cultivators over to that
[01:08:40.050 --> 01:08:46.050]  Ag Department process if possible. And so, you know, the former Ag Commissioner and the current
[01:08:46.050 --> 01:08:51.050]  Ag Commissioner are very much on the industry side here locally. And so they're not really
[01:08:51.050 --> 01:08:57.050]  on the industry side here locally. And so they have been pushing internally for that to happen.
[01:08:58.050 --> 01:09:03.050]  And so we'll see. We're kind of waiting right now as the county deals with, you know, the
[01:09:03.050 --> 01:09:09.050]  coronavirus. But I've been talking to the Ag Commissioner and he tells me that sometime this
[01:09:09.050 --> 01:09:15.050]  fall that is going to be discussed, that type of moving of cultivation over to the Ag Department
[01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:21.050]  and we'll see if the Board of Supervisors is with it. Yeah, I think that really anything that they can
[01:09:21.050 --> 01:09:27.050]  do to help people stay in business to get more tax revenue. Again, if they were to slightly reduce
[01:09:27.050 --> 01:09:32.050]  local taxes and make it less onerous to get a permit, they would have an increase in tax revenue
[01:09:32.050 --> 01:09:37.050]  because there'd be more businesses that could actually get permitted and survive and operate.
[01:09:37.050 --> 01:09:43.050]  And that's basic economics. Yeah, exactly. And is that something that literally the Board of
[01:09:43.050 --> 01:09:49.050]  Supervisors just has to get together and say all in favor of reducing taxes by 50 percent, say,
[01:09:49.050 --> 01:09:57.050]  aye, or is it more complicated than that? Well, I'd have to, you know, I have to go see at the county's
[01:09:57.050 --> 01:10:03.050]  current tax ordinance to what extent they can lower taxes, you know, what their ability to do that is.
[01:10:03.050 --> 01:10:10.050]  My guess is that, you know, they'd have to agree on that. And there has been some hesitation.
[01:10:11.050 --> 01:10:17.050]  The last time reducing the county taxes was really brought up to the supervisors was before Corona virus.
[01:10:17.050 --> 01:10:23.050]  It's been a little while since that issue issue actually got all the way up to them. I think when it comes back to them again,
[01:10:23.050 --> 01:10:30.050]  which will hopefully be soon, that's something that the Sonoma County Growers Alliance is taking on as a main policy objective,
[01:10:30.050 --> 01:10:36.050]  you know, for the rest of the year, reducing the taxes when it gets back to them again, they might be in a different tune.
[01:10:37.050 --> 01:10:43.050]  Just realizing how any relief they can provide is going to help these businesses and the county.
[01:10:44.050 --> 01:10:54.050]  So, yeah, and politically speaking, there has been, you know, the current Board of Supervisors is pretty supportive.
[01:10:54.050 --> 01:11:01.050]  There's one member of the board who was very anti-cannabis for the longest time, but seems to be coming around.
[01:11:01.050 --> 01:11:09.050]  We had a new hemp ordinance that went into place last month. So people can now grow hemp here in Sonoma County, as well as cannabis.
[01:11:09.050 --> 01:11:13.050]  So that's something interesting that the county has done. Not a lot of counties have allowed both.
[01:11:14.050 --> 01:11:19.050]  And so it's yet to be seen how that's going to work out. If that's a picture of the Board of Supervisors.
[01:11:19.050 --> 01:11:25.050]  So I'd say our strong, the industry's strongest ally is, oh, sorry. No worries.
[01:11:26.050 --> 01:11:40.050]  Yeah. So which of these, this very diverse group of people is the most supportive and the least supportive of the cannabis industry?
[01:11:40.050 --> 01:11:45.050]  Yeah, the most supportive and the woman in red hair, she was just voted out.
[01:11:45.050 --> 01:11:51.050]  So she's going to finish a term and there's going to be another white man replacing the lady with red hair.
[01:11:52.050 --> 01:11:58.050]  But the most outspoken advocate has been the lady in the tan jacket. That's Linda Hopkins.
[01:11:59.050 --> 01:12:06.050]  And the most outspoken opponent has been the guy on the far right, the slightly larger gentleman. That's David Rabbitt.
[01:12:07.050 --> 01:12:09.050]  He looks like a closet stoner.
[01:12:10.050 --> 01:12:14.050]  Can I fold in a subject that you might be dealing with up there?
[01:12:14.050 --> 01:12:20.050]  I'm looking at an article, lawsuit seeks to shut down Busy Bees Organics in Wine Country.
[01:12:21.050 --> 01:12:23.050]  This is in Santa Barbara County.
[01:12:23.050 --> 01:12:37.050]  And so the lawsuit also includes the Board of Supervisors, I think, because they're accusing them of breaking certain laws and approving certain permits.
[01:12:37.050 --> 01:12:44.050]  But it's ratcheting up. And aren't you in Wine Country also? Are you seeing any of these dynamics in play?
[01:12:45.050 --> 01:12:50.050]  Yeah, I'm up in Wine Country, slightly different from Wine Country, more the Sonoma and Napa area.
[01:12:50.050 --> 01:12:59.050]  But something that we have seen up here is concerned by the wine growers that it's going to,
[01:12:59.050 --> 01:13:03.050]  cannabis is going to impact the taste of their grapes, the taste of the wine.
[01:13:03.050 --> 01:13:06.050]  They're worried about that kind of a taint going on.
[01:13:06.050 --> 01:13:14.050]  They're concerned about the cannabis industry using up all the water that they need, even though wineries use far more water than most cannabis farms do.
[01:13:14.050 --> 01:13:22.050]  There has been, there was a RICO lawsuit that was filed against a cannabis operator a year or two ago.
[01:13:22.050 --> 01:13:27.050]  And the idea was that it was hurting and it wasn't filed by a winery.
[01:13:27.050 --> 01:13:35.050]  It was just these people in a big house, but they were claiming that their property value was going down because of the cannabis farm next door.
[01:13:35.050 --> 01:13:38.050]  I don't know what the current status of that lawsuit is.
[01:13:38.050 --> 01:13:44.050]  I know the judge originally threw out the RICO claims and was letting other parts of it go forward.
[01:13:44.050 --> 01:13:49.050]  But then I didn't follow it. I didn't really know anyone directly who was involved in that lawsuit.
[01:13:50.050 --> 01:13:55.050]  But it is certainly a concern that's being, that is being raised up here.
[01:13:55.050 --> 01:14:03.050]  Now, another concern is fire safety and making sure that all these roads are fire safe, fire accessible.
[01:14:03.050 --> 01:14:10.050]  We do have a lot of one way kind of dirt roads going up mountains in the county, and it's also fire territory.
[01:14:10.050 --> 01:14:15.050]  And so it can be dangerous to have a cannabis farm at the end of a one way road.
[01:14:15.050 --> 01:14:19.050]  If you need emergency vehicles, got to come in and out. There's other people on the street.
[01:14:19.050 --> 01:14:25.050]  So that's been an issue that opponents have started to use to oppose cannabis projects.
[01:14:25.050 --> 01:14:32.050]  It's looking at the roads to get in and out, making sure they're all up to fire codes and trying to stall projects based on something like that.
[01:14:32.050 --> 01:14:36.050]  And I think there is, I think there is some merit to that. Obviously, the roads need to be safe.
[01:14:36.050 --> 01:14:43.050]  You have to be able to get vehicles in and out safely and not get to a problem where the fire truck can't get there because the road's not wide enough.
[01:14:43.050 --> 01:14:53.050]  However, I think that's also now being used to stop like legitimate projects that, you know, do have everything in place, but they're just trying to stall them.
[01:14:53.050 --> 01:14:56.050]  So, yeah.
[01:14:56.050 --> 01:15:08.050]  How about raids? You know, up in Humboldt, Mendocino, out in the mountains of San Bernardino, friends have been talking about the raids are coming back again in full force.
[01:15:08.050 --> 01:15:11.050]  Are you seeing that in Sonoma or what are you seeing?
[01:15:12.050 --> 01:15:17.050]  I don't think there's been any raids in Sonoma County. Not that I can think of.
[01:15:17.050 --> 01:15:23.050]  I have heard about the ones that you mentioned up in the Emerald Triangle and down in Central Coast area.
[01:15:23.050 --> 01:15:28.050]  Thankfully, that hasn't really happened, happened here.
[01:15:28.050 --> 01:15:38.050]  And I hope it doesn't. I mean, it's absolutely terrifying when we have that kind of a harsh law enforcement approach to people selling these plants.
[01:15:38.050 --> 01:15:52.050]  And, you know, I certainly think there are folks who are bad actors in the industry, people that are growing in, you know, state and national parks, people who are using dangerous chemicals, people who are just, you know, not following the rules.
[01:15:52.050 --> 01:15:57.050]  But that's not the folks who are in the regulated industry for the most part.
[01:15:58.050 --> 01:16:09.050]  And so I'm hopeful that they don't, you know, continue resorting to those scary tactics that really, you know, can leave people with PTSD for a long time to come afterwards.
[01:16:09.050 --> 01:16:14.050]  Yeah, I mean, and Eric, how about in LA?
[01:16:15.050 --> 01:16:33.050]  The raids they have don't come close to making a dent in anything, you know, and a lot of it as well is that, especially with COVID-19 going on, there has been a lot of violent offenders released from jail who are back into the city here.
[01:16:33.050 --> 01:16:38.050]  And so property crimes have gone way up. Break-ins have gone way up.
[01:16:38.050 --> 01:16:45.050]  And that's something I've, over the last two months with indoor growers here, break-ins have probably went up a thousand percent.
[01:16:45.050 --> 01:16:58.050]  You know, I know of some companies that have had attempted break-ins every week, you know, and typically maybe you'll get an attempted break-in once every three or four months, you know, because it just happens.
[01:16:59.050 --> 01:17:11.050]  You know, there's, there, you know, a lot of these are done by criminal gangs and it's very organized, but yeah, the amount of break-ins over the last month and a half is just levels that I've never heard of before.
[01:17:11.050 --> 01:17:18.050]  So that's definitely something going on. But yes, and then police are just very occupied here with everything else.
[01:17:18.050 --> 01:17:30.050]  For them, I think cannabis is a very low priority, which is frustrating. And I know, Tom, you hear this from Greg all the time, is that the illegal shops are there sometimes a block and a half from a regulated shop.
[01:17:30.050 --> 01:17:41.050]  The permit people come show up at the inspected shop and they'll say, Hey, a block and a half away is an illegal shop. Why don't you go check them out? And the inspectors are scared to go there, you know?
[01:17:41.050 --> 01:17:56.050]  And so they don't really do anything. And, you know, I think really with, with enforcement, if there's one thing the last, what are we on? 90 years of drug war has showed us is that enforcement really, really is not the answer.
[01:17:56.050 --> 01:18:08.050]  And the answer is to incentivize legal businesses to be competitive with the illegal businesses. Imagine if everything was flipped and 80% of the market was legal and only 20% was illegal.
[01:18:08.050 --> 01:18:15.050]  We'd be very close to stomping it out. Maybe we could start rebranding that herd immunity.
[01:18:15.050 --> 01:18:41.050]  Yeah, no, I mean, that gets back to the sensible taxes. I mean, that's pretty much the main, all they need to do is be sensible. And you don't really have a moonshine market. You don't really have an illicit, you know, serial or CPG market. I mean, maybe you have knockoffs on the streets of Chinatown in New York.
[01:18:42.050 --> 01:19:04.050]  It's tough to be, you know, I remember when they did the first budget, when Jerry Brown was governor, and this is part of it, you know, we talk about what we understand is economics, because we've all owned businesses. And it's, you know, if you lower, if you lower the taxes, you generate more economic activity, which often will actually increase the revenue.
[01:19:05.050 --> 01:19:20.050]  You know, I remember when the first tax report came in, and it was one third of projections, you know, when Jerry Brown was governor, they, you know, they talked about the first tax cut, they projected 120 million coming in or something like that. And it ended up being like 30 million that came in.
[01:19:21.050 --> 01:19:44.050]  And from his quote, basically was like, you know, if we hit one third of our tax revenue, we're not going to cut taxes, because then we're going to get even less money. And they, you know, a lot of people, they just don't even look at that other side that, you know, if you tax it less, you're going to have more businesses coming in, which will raise it and that they're oblivious to that side of the argument.
[01:19:45.050 --> 01:19:52.050]  I don't know how to, how to broach that gap so that we understand that, you know, that that's actually a real thing, you know,
[01:19:53.050 --> 01:20:19.050]  that gets back to me kind of, it seems so obvious, you know, I bring up Walmart, Costco and Amazon, they do high volume, low margin, and they they have, they're very profitable, right? Versus Lamborghini, which sells, you know, a limited number of cars per year at a very high margin, but not a lot of them. And that's our that's our that's our California tax structure where the Lamborghini tax structure.
[01:20:19.050 --> 01:20:48.050]  But nobody's making lots of money because you also don't get to deduct anything. And but so just quickly, when when you get paid, so your distributor collects money from the retail shops, and then do they literally like is everything in cash or talk about like, are they walking in with a big duffel bag of cash or?
[01:20:49.050 --> 01:20:51.050]  Do you get checks for anything or?
[01:20:51.050 --> 01:20:54.050]  No, it's a very small duffel bag of cash.
[01:20:54.050 --> 01:20:59.050]  But but but it is all cash, like there's no checks or anything.
[01:20:59.050 --> 01:21:14.050]  And yeah, yeah, it's it's it's cash. I mean, I could get checks if I wanted to, but then you run into the whole banking thing. And you know, but cash is just the easiest way to avoid.
[01:21:14.050 --> 01:21:16.050]  Do you currently have a bank?
[01:21:17.050 --> 01:21:20.050]  Without naming names? Right.
[01:21:22.050 --> 01:21:26.050]  How many? How many banks have you gone through?
[01:21:28.050 --> 01:21:45.050]  Um, let's see. I, you know, the thing with banks is that banks know you're operating a cannabis business, they won't allow you to use their bank. And as far as I know, I'm not sure if you're allowed to.
[01:21:46.050 --> 01:21:59.050]  Tell a bank your banking account is for something other than a cannabis business. So I you know, I'm not sure about the legalities of any of that. And it's not to say I do or don't do any of
[01:22:01.050 --> 01:22:07.050]  Right. But but but but but then the purpose of the Facebook machine, I'm just gonna right.
[01:22:07.050 --> 01:22:08.050]  Right.
[01:22:13.390 --> 01:22:27.390]  You know, I've been in this industry. I've been in this industry a long time. And so self incriminated and self incrimination is not the best thing, which I'm sure Lauren will agree with me that self incrimination is never
[01:22:31.390 --> 01:22:33.390]  Don't don't incriminate yourself.
[01:22:34.390 --> 01:22:55.390]  I think we can. So any any I think we can probably wrap and I just wanted to see if Lauren or or Eric, if you guys have any last words, things that are top of mind for you in the the joyful California cannabis industry.
[01:22:56.390 --> 01:23:21.390]  So as far as from myself, you know, I would just like to point out, we didn't really get into it. But there was that really bad fire that happened on Saturday in downtown LA on head shop row where they were warehousing most likely 10s of thousands of cans of butane that ultimately were most likely intended for people to illegally make hash oil.
[01:23:22.390 --> 01:23:32.390]  And I think one, most of the initial reports blamed it on making hash oil, which turned out to not be the case. And, you know, our industry gets blamed for that.
[01:23:33.390 --> 01:23:38.390]  And secondly, it's another example of why we need to continue to work harder to
[01:23:39.390 --> 01:23:52.390]  To make our industry 100% legal above board and away from the illicit industry. So things like this don't happen. Some of the first responders and LA FD firefighters were hurt very, very badly in that fire.
[01:23:53.390 --> 01:24:05.390]  One of the injuries, I believe, is is going to be one that you know will be life changing for one of these firefighters and you know this this happened because of the
[01:24:06.390 --> 01:24:19.390]  Illegal industry, you know, and it's, it's just, you know, it's and and at the same time we kind of get blamed for it. So it's just shows that there's more work for us to be done. And we have to continue to work to
[01:24:20.390 --> 01:24:28.390]  Make it 100% legal industry and a 0% illegal industry. So we don't have these things happen and God bless our firefighters for going
[01:24:29.390 --> 01:24:38.390]  Into these situations and it really just illustrates the bravery of them all of our first responders, you know, let's throw LAPD in there for
[01:24:39.390 --> 01:24:47.390]  You know that they do a lot of a lot of tough work as well. And all of our first responders all over the state. And so really just want to give a shout out to them and
[01:24:48.390 --> 01:24:56.390]  Yeah, but that's I guess that's where I'll end it on something kind of completely different and I'm sure more will come out to this and it'll become a topic for another time.
[01:24:58.390 --> 01:25:05.390]  Lauren top of my mind right now is getting cannabis businesses, the, the relief and the assistance they need.
[01:25:06.390 --> 01:25:25.390]  So, you know, that could look like extending the deferral relief that the licensing agencies just offered, you know, if we can get that extended past 60 days, that would be great. If we can get at the federal level, there's efforts now to get
[01:25:26.390 --> 01:25:33.390]  First of all, to treat cannabis like other businesses. So they're eligible for all the SBA loans and other federal leaf.
[01:25:33.390 --> 01:25:44.390]  But also now the cannabis a fix for cannabis banking has been added to the latest coronavirus relief bill. It's called the Heroes Act and as as written
[01:25:45.390 --> 01:25:50.390]  That would, you know, open up banking access really for cannabis companies and that would
[01:25:50.390 --> 01:25:55.390]  That would help a lot. I think I have a lot of clients that are struggling because they don't have
[01:25:55.390 --> 01:26:03.390]  A good access to banking or their accounts keep getting shut down or and it limits your ability to get to get funding really as well.
[01:26:04.390 --> 01:26:11.390]  So that is, we'll see if it passes. I'm not super optimistic about it. But I think what it shows is that at the federal level level.
[01:26:12.390 --> 01:26:15.390]  I actually think that coronavirus has
[01:26:15.390 --> 01:26:24.390]  Increased the chances of cannabis getting federally legal sooner just because so many different states have deemed these businesses to be essential.
[01:26:25.390 --> 01:26:33.390]  And so many different now federal lawmakers are signing on to things that would add, you know, provide cannabis relief.
[01:26:33.390 --> 01:26:43.390]  I think that there is a tide that's, you know, turning their federally I'm optimistic about that. I think folks should get involved and advocate to all your representatives local, state and federal
[01:26:44.390 --> 01:26:54.390]  Because, you know, legalization would certainly help a lot of things. Then we could do cross border transactions, we could, you know, participate in the global cannabis market that is out there.
[01:26:55.390 --> 01:26:57.390]  And so that's really the thing. And also just
[01:26:57.390 --> 01:27:03.390]  You know, making sure that everyone stays safe right now. It's a scary and confusing time stay safe, stay sane.
[01:27:04.390 --> 01:27:11.390]  And helping each other out. And we'll, we can get through this, but no one can do it alone. We gotta be there for each other.
[01:27:11.390 --> 01:27:27.390]  Alright, and on that we will end the conversation. Let me just conclude with the slide. And so thank you everyone. I appreciate your time. And with that, we are stopping the live stream.
