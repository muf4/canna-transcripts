[00:00.000 --> 00:10.480]  We are live. Patient access, kind of a history of patient access with a focus on Los Angeles
[00:10.480 --> 00:17.040]  and a little bit the Bay Area and then we will talk about the current state of patients and
[00:17.040 --> 00:25.040]  access to medical cannabis in 2020. So let's kick it off and I think Sarah Armstrong, if
[00:25.280 --> 00:29.760]  you want to kind of start with a little history lesson.
[00:32.080 --> 00:39.600]  Sure. Since access came very late to Los Angeles in 1996, the Compassionate Use Act
[00:40.320 --> 00:46.800]  was passed and immediately in the Bay Area, places started opening up. Most notably the
[00:46.800 --> 00:53.440]  Berkeley Patients Group, which Don Duncombe was a founding member of.
[00:54.800 --> 01:00.960]  What happened in LA was people kept trying and people kept getting raided and closed. I think
[01:01.680 --> 01:08.720]  most of you who have been around for a while remember the Yellow House or Scott Emler's
[01:08.720 --> 01:16.160]  operation in West Hollywood. It wasn't until 2005 when we had our first stable group of
[01:16.800 --> 01:21.280]  dispensaries and they were all in West Hollywood and West Hollywood was very welcoming.
[01:23.680 --> 01:29.840]  Don Duncombe, who had been part of the Berkeley Patients Group, came to LA and opened LA PCG.
[01:30.800 --> 01:35.600]  He worked with others to get an ordinance in West Hollywood and then turned his attention
[01:35.600 --> 01:44.320]  to Los Angeles. He was already an activist with 10 years experience in the cannabis field.
[01:45.440 --> 01:51.760]  For those of you who have never met him, he's a very short-haired, conservative-looking guy, but
[01:53.120 --> 02:00.880]  very engaging and upbeat. He went and negotiated with Dennis Zine, a councilman at that time who
[02:00.960 --> 02:07.760]  was a former cop. The end result of that was something called the Pre-ICO List.
[02:09.040 --> 02:15.520]  Today, one of your guests, Michael Backus, was on that list. He founded Cornerstone.
[02:16.320 --> 02:21.360]  Just so people know, when people who were really sick came into our dispensaries,
[02:21.360 --> 02:26.640]  we sent them to Cornerstone because we knew that they would get the kind of care
[02:27.280 --> 02:31.440]  that people who are really sick and not going to be around in a year need.
[02:33.440 --> 02:41.760]  He's one of my great heroes. The Pre-ICO List invited anyone who was operating in the city to
[02:41.760 --> 02:48.800]  come forward and register. The promise was that you would get an ordinance down the line.
[02:49.600 --> 02:57.520]  That took from 2007 to 2010. During that period, all of these people who came forward,
[02:57.520 --> 03:04.480]  most all of them, were rated at least once. The LAPD was not shy about this activity,
[03:04.480 --> 03:12.880]  and the DEA came every summer. It was a very dark time. When the first ordinance came forward in
[03:12.880 --> 03:20.400]  2010, it was fatally defective. Among other things, it gave people only something like a month
[03:20.960 --> 03:26.880]  to find a location that would be compliant with their sensitive uses, which if any of you have
[03:26.880 --> 03:32.960]  ever looked for a dispensary, you know you never get a lease in just one month. Another
[03:32.960 --> 03:39.920]  real big problem was they wanted all cannabis to be tested, but they were insisting that it be a
[03:39.920 --> 03:46.880]  certified lab, which means it's a federal lab certification and it cannot be done at the
[03:47.760 --> 03:52.640]  local level because at the federal level, marijuana is illegal.
[03:54.480 --> 04:01.600]  What followed then were a series of ordinances. ASA was the first to sue. We sued in 2010
[04:02.240 --> 04:06.800]  on the original ordinance, but there were other lawsuits. Eventually,
[04:09.920 --> 04:16.640]  things got so bad that a consortium on the City Council, and we've always had between three and
[04:16.640 --> 04:28.480]  five real opponents, forced through a ban. Between 2012 and 2013, the retail operators in Los Angeles
[04:28.480 --> 04:38.880]  came together with a meaningful assist from UFCW Local 770. They originally had their ordinance.
[04:38.880 --> 04:46.480]  We abandoned it in favor of the city's ordinance, which came to be known as Prop D. It passed.
[04:47.440 --> 04:52.720]  For the first time, we had stability. For the next three years, everybody was under
[04:53.920 --> 05:00.240]  what's called limited immunity. Limited immunity is just a system where if you're accused of
[05:00.240 --> 05:05.120]  wrongdoing, you can go into court and say, you know what? I was following the rules the city
[05:05.120 --> 05:14.960]  said I should follow. I am not the problem here. What happened with all this was a real retardation
[05:14.960 --> 05:27.760]  in terms of any kind of development for cultivators, for manufacturers. If they were
[05:27.840 --> 05:36.000]  to claim limited immunity, they had to be part of a medical cannabis dispensary.
[05:36.000 --> 05:41.520]  They were the patient providers. What this meant was that we were kind of
[05:44.480 --> 05:53.040]  screwed up because there was no real industry. If it existed at all, it was kind of underground
[05:53.040 --> 06:02.240]  and sort of not two together. That led finally to Prop M, which was launched by the UCBA
[06:02.960 --> 06:13.680]  in tandem with the UFCW. They abandoned their voter initiative in good form and signed on to the city.
[06:13.680 --> 06:20.080]  That's really how you got Measure M, which for the first time held out the hope that we could
[06:20.080 --> 06:28.240]  have a true industry. Concurrent with that, there was a real problem in that the state of California
[06:28.240 --> 06:35.840]  finally decided to regulate and everybody and their dog decided to tax. While we finally had
[06:35.840 --> 06:43.920]  stability and the promise of licensing and the promise of an industry, it rapidly became so
[06:43.920 --> 06:52.960]  expensive for operators to exist that they were passing costs onto patients and there was very
[06:52.960 --> 06:59.600]  little relief. The state of California also did some very nasty things. They got rid of the
[06:59.600 --> 07:08.000]  compassion programs for a while. We fought back. We got that. It's been an ongoing
[07:08.000 --> 07:15.200]  dialogue with the state. But the kind of regulation that you see nowadays is way too much and way too
[07:15.200 --> 07:24.240]  expensive. In Los Angeles, we self-regulated. The dispensary self-regulated for many, many years.
[07:25.040 --> 07:30.960]  They had a code of conduct which they had to follow, which was put forward by GLACA, the
[07:30.960 --> 07:40.000]  Greater Los Angeles Collective Alliance. They did pretty well. I don't ever remember going into a shop that was
[07:40.000 --> 07:49.920]  dirty or poorly staffed or had any problems. From my point of view, one of the main bars to safe access
[07:49.920 --> 07:58.000]  right now is not dispensary operators. It's the taxes and regulation that have pushed them into a very bad
[07:58.000 --> 08:10.320]  place and forced them to pass on a lot of the costs to the patients, making safe tested marijuana, cannabis,
[08:10.320 --> 08:18.640]  very difficult to come by in a price range that the average person who's ill can afford.
[08:19.600 --> 08:29.680]  Concurrent with this, there has been a huge upsurge in delivery and retail operations that are unlicensed.
[08:29.680 --> 08:43.600]  Repeated journalist exposÃ©s have tested the products in these shops and found them to be contaminated with a lot of
[08:43.600 --> 08:51.600]  very dangerous things. For patients, it's particularly dangerous because if you're really sick, you often have a
[08:51.600 --> 08:58.640]  compromised immune system. Perhaps the best example of this was the great leader of GLACA, Yanni Balanos, who was a
[08:58.640 --> 09:07.600]  transplant recipient. In order to get the transplant to work, they have to suppress the immune system.
[09:07.600 --> 09:16.640]  It's very important that anything that's sold to a patient be very, very clean. Today, the city council voted to
[09:16.640 --> 09:26.640]  support a state bill which would allow law enforcement to test cannabis at licensed cannabis labs.
[09:26.720 --> 09:38.720]  What we're thinking is to avoid the war on drugs 2.0, keep this as a civil nuisance abatement, but factor in the fact that if
[09:38.720 --> 09:45.680]  you're found to be selling poison to the public, you're going to face some fines that are really spectacular.
[09:45.680 --> 09:49.680]  That's all I got. Does anybody have any questions?
[09:50.680 --> 10:06.720]  Since the reactivation of the compassion program, I guess it was in March, how effective has it been?
[10:06.720 --> 10:17.720]  I guess I'm asking in the context of a pandemic, which was the instigation for us wanting to have this conversation.
[10:17.760 --> 10:31.760]  It's hard enough with the taxes. How are they surviving in the current situation? In that context, how's the compassion program
[10:31.760 --> 10:34.760]  doing anecdotally from y'all?
[10:34.800 --> 10:48.260]  From nearly as far as I can tell, people are trying, but it is a very difficult time. One shop is starting a compassion
[10:48.260 --> 10:57.260]  program specifically for veterans. Some of the bigger shops that do a lot of volume have instituted some very nice
[10:57.300 --> 11:07.300]  discounts for senior citizens and veterans. I believe there is a very famous compassion program that's run for veterans.
[11:07.300 --> 11:17.300]  I think they are up and running. As nearly as I can tell in Los Angeles, people badly want to reinstate their compassion
[11:17.340 --> 11:27.340]  programs, but the coronavirus is just screwing everything up. Does anybody else have any insights?
[11:27.340 --> 11:36.340]  You really have to ask. I haven't been in a lot of shops where they're asking you, ask us about our compassion program.
[11:36.380 --> 11:48.380]  I think it's relatively new. I think it's going to take a little while to take hold. But also, I think there's been a real
[11:48.380 --> 12:01.380]  sea change among ownership of dispensaries. It used to be true mom and pops. I can't tell you how many dispensaries in LA
[12:01.420 --> 12:11.420]  where I used to know the owners well. Now they've been basically bought by charitably hedge fund guys.
[12:11.420 --> 12:19.420]  Really, they've changed their pricing. They've gotten much more aggressive on their markups. It used to be basically
[12:19.420 --> 12:25.420]  everything was Keystone. So when a dispensary bought something, they basically just doubled the price like most
[12:25.460 --> 12:34.460]  dealers do. These days, the average is 2.7 times markup. That's a dramatic increase. They're saying, oh, well, that's because
[12:34.460 --> 12:45.460]  we have to pay taxes on the products. But the math doesn't really work out. I think California cannabis industry
[12:45.500 --> 12:56.500]  is really suffering some issues that predate the pandemic, but were exacerbated by the pandemic. I think it's going to be a
[12:56.500 --> 13:05.500]  little while till we're out of the woods and till these businesses are a little healthier. I think that really impacts
[13:05.500 --> 13:13.500]  patient access. Then also, the truth is most dispensaries really don't train their staff particularly well.
[13:13.540 --> 13:23.540]  They've often been very compassionate towards patients, but they can't really help patients because they don't know
[13:23.540 --> 13:31.540]  what's in the products. I was in a big fancy dispensary the other day and I asked some really basic questions.
[13:31.540 --> 13:38.540]  The staff looked at me like, it was like asking a cow.
[13:38.540 --> 13:42.540]  What were some example questions that you were asking?
[13:42.580 --> 13:51.580]  How much are these clones? You have terpene testing listed on every one of your products. Who does the terpene
[13:51.580 --> 14:02.580]  testing? Does the cultivator do it or does the lab do it? Who determines, I mean, do these change batch to batch?
[14:02.580 --> 14:09.580]  They were listing all the varieties and they're the three predominant terpenes. Of course, in my experience,
[14:09.620 --> 14:15.620]  those can move a little bit crop to crop depending on storage conditions, depending on all kinds of things.
[14:15.620 --> 14:25.620]  Basically, I was asking is this information accurate and prove it? That seems like a reasonable question because if I walk
[14:25.660 --> 14:40.660]  into CVS and ask to see their COA for Valium, they have one. These places just aren't really in the medicine business.
[14:40.660 --> 14:48.660]  Well, you're right, Michael. The state doesn't require a dispensary to train their staff.
[14:48.700 --> 14:58.700]  No, not at all. Not at all, by the way, but not at all. It's literally, it's going to be the public that demands the dispensaries
[14:58.700 --> 15:04.700]  train their staff. But the problem is you got to educate the public too. That's another thing.
[15:04.700 --> 15:14.700]  Yeah, well, I kind of think it's responsibility, honestly. They feel very responsible in making sure you track your products,
[15:14.740 --> 15:24.740]  you label them correctly, but they're okay with letting anyone step into a dispensary and pretend to know how it works as medicine.
[15:24.740 --> 15:31.740]  And like you said, they don't know. CVS has licensed pharmacists.
[15:31.740 --> 15:39.740]  Yeah, I mean, the classic thing is that basically the distinguishing factors for recommending medicine to patients are Indica and Sativa.
[15:39.780 --> 15:55.780]  But as I said, I was on this French cannoli thing the other day, and I said that Indica and Sativa is as good at predicting a fact as thinking you can tell the taste of a nut by looking at the shape of the tree.
[15:55.780 --> 16:03.780]  And I mean, yeah, these people don't have no scientific background at all, and they're not trained.
[16:03.820 --> 16:14.820]  So, you know, I'm not really pointing fingers at them. I feel kind of that we've got to change that culture because people are coming in asking for medicine,
[16:14.820 --> 16:19.820]  and it'd be really great if the complete responsibility wasn't on the patient.
[16:19.820 --> 16:30.820]  I mean, that's what I tried to do back at Cornerstone, was start to change that equation by making my staff read papers and understand some of the more technical details.
[16:30.860 --> 16:39.860]  And really, I agree completely with you, Michael. And really, you know, going back to the patient, the patient is experiencing the effect.
[16:39.860 --> 16:49.860]  And are we asking the patient? I mean, every day I talk to patients and I ask them what their effect is.
[16:49.900 --> 16:52.900]  But no one's really asking or collecting that data.
[16:52.900 --> 17:03.900]  You know, that's what I've begun to do so that we can correlate the active ingredients, the active product ingredients with an effect.
[17:03.940 --> 17:08.940]  It's a pretty simple thing to do. We can crowdsource and find out.
[17:08.940 --> 17:27.940]  And, you know, I'd love for the regulatory practices to have that involvement rather than it's all about THC getting high and being worried about adverse events like driving THC.
[17:27.980 --> 17:35.980]  That seems to be the focus of any research. But really what we should be looking at are the characteristic effects of plant.
[17:35.980 --> 17:51.980]  I mean, cannabis science still suffers from the kind of NIDA on down, which is, you know, as Nora Volkow, who's the head of the National Institutes of Drug Abuse, said that we're not the National Institutes of Drug Use.
[17:52.020 --> 17:59.020]  We just are into how it's abused. And therefore, that's what our research is going to focus on.
[17:59.020 --> 18:05.020]  It'll focus on abuse. And to this day, I mean, it's improved a little bit, but not much.
[18:05.020 --> 18:18.020]  I mean, most universities are scared to death of doing cannabis research because they're afraid they're going to lose their DEA license, which they need to do a lot of research.
[18:18.060 --> 18:27.060]  And at the local level, I go in all the time, show my driver's license and make a little buy, talk to the bartenders.
[18:27.060 --> 18:35.060]  And one of the most unfortunate things is they really don't know their medicine, but they sure know how to upsell.
[18:35.060 --> 18:38.060]  They're very sales oriented.
[18:38.060 --> 18:45.060]  And if you're a patient and you're sick, most likely you don't have all the money in the world to spend.
[18:45.100 --> 18:52.100]  And if you're being told, oh, well, if you need this effect, you have to spend Y amount of money.
[18:52.100 --> 18:57.100]  That's kind of a hard thing to hear when you're really sick.
[18:59.100 --> 19:05.100]  Yeah. And the truth is that the really inexpensive medicines, I mean, because I've seen this before.
[19:05.100 --> 19:11.100]  I've seen compassion programs that basically scoop from the bottom of the barrel to help patients.
[19:11.140 --> 19:23.140]  And the truth is patients often need the cannabis that's in the best shape, not the cannabis that's indifferently cultivated and has been poorly stored and was grown a long time ago.
[19:23.140 --> 19:35.140]  And yeah, I mean, and I fought, I fought with, you know, partners and dispensers to raise the quality of medicine that is provided under compassion programs.
[19:35.180 --> 19:45.180]  Because I think that often, you know, patients don't need one more problem, which is to get, you know, indifferently produced cannabis and try to use it as a medicine.
[19:46.180 --> 19:59.180]  So I have a question. If patients, and I'm one of them, and I totally concur, if you cannot derive that information that you need from the bud tender at the dispensary, where do you get it?
[19:59.220 --> 20:04.220]  Alice, where do you go? Where do you go and get the data and the information that you need?
[20:04.220 --> 20:11.220]  Oh, hi guys. Yeah, as a patient myself, I just, thank you for pointing me out.
[20:12.220 --> 20:21.220]  Yeah, you know, I definitely want to say, you know, I have cerebral palsy and my wife has multiple sclerosis and we're both on SSI.
[20:21.260 --> 20:28.260]  You know, we do not have all the money in the world to spend on quality, you know, quality care.
[20:29.260 --> 20:46.260]  We basically had to create our own platform called wearerollingstone.com to figure out which medicines were doing the good stuff and that we could say, yeah, I had no adverse effects.
[20:46.300 --> 21:03.300]  It's basically been through that platform that I've been able to, you know, meet people that are giving the good medicines and, you know, occasionally they'll kind of throw me a bone, but I feel like there's not enough of that at all.
[21:03.340 --> 21:10.340]  It's all about money, money, money. It's not really about healing.
[21:11.340 --> 21:22.340]  But there are certain places like 3C Farms that are doing really great things with their medicines, but that's few and far between, especially here in Los Angeles. Absolutely.
[21:22.380 --> 21:37.380]  But when I first started medicating in 2007, I can tell you that I half the time I would panic when I was medicating and I was medicating to stop seizures at that point.
[21:38.380 --> 21:48.380]  So there was large points in time where I would stop medicating because it would just, you know, it would defeat the purpose of why I was doing it.
[21:48.420 --> 21:57.420]  And then once everything got regulated, I could medicate with whatever I want, however much I want. The sky's the limit, right?
[21:58.420 --> 22:03.420]  But it's crazy, crazy unaffordable.
[22:03.460 --> 22:09.460]  But there's places like CaliHash, there's 3C Farms, Raw Garden.
[22:10.460 --> 22:22.460]  You know, I think, you know, you just have to find people that are maybe having more or less the middle ground in their pricing, but are also doing that top quality medicine.
[22:24.460 --> 22:29.460]  I mean, nobody really talks about it, you know, at all to the patients.
[22:29.500 --> 22:39.500]  And what you were saying, I mean, I hate it when I go to go in and talk to whoever people that I know and I say, well, what about this?
[22:40.500 --> 22:41.500]  It drives me nuts.
[22:42.500 --> 22:55.500]  I mean, it's great because there are extract companies now that are, I mean, extracts are really put through the mill because what it is, is that if they get bad cannabis, that problem gets concentrated in the concentrate.
[22:55.540 --> 23:03.540]  And so what's good is, is when you get a clean concentrate and you get companies that really know how to make them,
[23:04.540 --> 23:09.540]  the good news is that it often can provide more affordable medicine to patients.
[23:09.540 --> 23:16.540]  I mean, I really like Raw Garden because they're inexpensive and there's a lot of bang for the buck.
[23:16.540 --> 23:22.540]  They know how to protect terpene content, though often the retailers don't.
[23:22.580 --> 23:29.580]  I mean, the thing is, is that as medicine, cannabis should be kept cold and it rarely is.
[23:29.580 --> 23:32.580]  And extracts are even more delicate.
[23:32.580 --> 23:40.580]  And so if you're using cannabis extracts as a medicine, you kind of have to find people that understand that the supply chain,
[23:40.580 --> 23:44.580]  it's more like produce than it is cardboard.
[23:44.620 --> 23:49.620]  And so you have to, you know, just like you wouldn't leave a head of lettuce out for four months,
[23:49.620 --> 23:56.620]  you probably don't want to leave a cannabis extract at room temperature for four months because a lot of it's going to break down.
[23:57.620 --> 23:58.620]  Interesting.
[23:58.620 --> 23:59.620]  Interesting.
[23:59.620 --> 24:00.620]  Oh, yeah.
[24:01.620 --> 24:02.620]  Go ahead.
[24:02.620 --> 24:04.620]  I didn't even, I was just rambling.
[24:04.620 --> 24:05.620]  Go ahead.
[24:06.620 --> 24:12.620]  No, I'm just wondering if the break, does the breakdown happen over four months or is it more than four months?
[24:12.660 --> 24:16.660]  Does the breakdown happen over four months or is it gradual over that time, Michael?
[24:17.660 --> 24:21.660]  Actually, in the case of some of the lighter monoterpenes like myrcene,
[24:21.660 --> 24:29.660]  you can lose half of your myrcene content in less than 45 days if you don't refrigerate.
[24:30.660 --> 24:38.660]  And so my recommendation for people who use cannabis as a medicine is don't assume it's been handled correctly before it gets to you,
[24:38.660 --> 24:41.660]  but take responsibility once it does.
[24:41.700 --> 24:48.700]  And what I do is I recommend you keep your cannabis in the freezer and just take out what you're going to use and don't let it thaw.
[24:48.700 --> 24:50.700]  Think of it like ice cream.
[24:51.700 --> 24:52.700]  Okay.
[24:52.700 --> 24:53.700]  You want to keep it cold.
[24:53.700 --> 25:00.700]  So that's why Raw Garden is as good as they are because they use that fresh frozen technique.
[25:00.700 --> 25:02.700]  Yeah, a lot of people are now.
[25:02.700 --> 25:06.700]  I mean, the thing is, if you're using hydrocarbon extraction, you want to use fresh frozen cannabis.
[25:06.700 --> 25:10.700]  And the reason is, is it's just how the extraction machines work.
[25:10.740 --> 25:13.740]  I mean, I've gotten really into extraction technology.
[25:13.740 --> 25:20.740]  And so, yeah, I mean, I bought a low temperature freezer that keeps everything at, you know, minus 76.
[25:20.740 --> 25:22.740]  And, you know, it's really...
[25:22.740 --> 25:26.740]  And then when you extract, you extract at 120 degrees below zero.
[25:27.740 --> 25:30.740]  And what that does is that allows you to make high-terbium extracts.
[25:30.740 --> 25:38.740]  And it's these high-terbine cannabinoid combinations that I find have the most medicinal efficiency,
[25:38.780 --> 25:41.780]  whether you're talking about THC or CBD or whatever.
[25:41.780 --> 25:43.780]  Because you're getting the whole plant that way.
[25:43.780 --> 25:46.780]  You're getting fresh frozen whole plant that way, correct?
[25:46.780 --> 25:47.780]  Exactly.
[25:47.780 --> 25:50.780]  So it's really, it's a really fascinating thing.
[25:50.780 --> 25:55.780]  I mean, you know, I was on here basically to talk about Cornerstone.
[25:55.780 --> 25:58.780]  Cornerstone started, we knew nothing about the science.
[25:58.780 --> 26:00.780]  We couldn't find anything with CBD in it.
[26:00.780 --> 26:03.780]  The first time I ever got a plant that supposedly had CBD in it,
[26:03.820 --> 26:08.820]  we went through a whole crop cycle to find out that the person was mistaken.
[26:08.820 --> 26:10.820]  They'd given us Harlequin.
[26:10.820 --> 26:13.820]  And when we tested it, it was pure THC.
[26:14.820 --> 26:17.820]  And we found out when we like, we were so excited.
[26:17.820 --> 26:19.820]  We got our first crop of CBD.
[26:19.820 --> 26:22.820]  We gave it to a bunch of people and they immediately called within hours and go,
[26:22.820 --> 26:23.820]  man, I'm really stoned.
[26:25.820 --> 26:28.820]  And so, those kind of misfires.
[26:28.860 --> 26:32.860]  I mean, when we started looking for CBD down in Southern California,
[26:33.860 --> 26:35.860]  Northern California was already ahead of us.
[26:35.860 --> 26:38.860]  And so folks like Martin Lee and Fred Garner,
[26:38.860 --> 26:43.860]  who formed Project CBD, work with gardeners like Wayne Loft,
[26:43.860 --> 26:50.860]  Wayne Lofter and Lawrence Ringo and these guys who were the first people to find
[26:51.860 --> 26:53.860]  plants that had any CBD.
[26:53.900 --> 26:56.900]  This is before the pure CBD varieties.
[26:57.900 --> 27:01.900]  There was one, the story of CBD in the West is really fascinating.
[27:01.900 --> 27:04.900]  And I don't know if a lot of people know it, but what happened was
[27:06.900 --> 27:13.900]  a kid bought a kilo of New York East Coast sour diesel seeds from Soma in Amsterdam.
[27:14.900 --> 27:15.900]  Didn't pay for them.
[27:16.900 --> 27:18.900]  Went down to Spain and grew out a bunch of them.
[27:18.940 --> 27:24.940]  And one of those seeds became the pure CBD line,
[27:25.940 --> 27:28.940]  which was called catatonic when it was in Spain.
[27:29.940 --> 27:32.940]  And when it was stolen and brought to Northern California,
[27:32.940 --> 27:34.940]  they renamed it ACDC.
[27:34.940 --> 27:37.940]  And then the Stanley brothers stole it and they took it to Colorado
[27:37.940 --> 27:39.940]  and they called it Charlotte's Web.
[27:40.940 --> 27:44.940]  And the thing is, is that, I mean, but that's not like pointing fingers.
[27:45.940 --> 27:46.940]  That's how it's done.
[27:46.980 --> 27:50.980]  People lift genetics all the, historically all the time.
[27:51.980 --> 27:56.980]  And so there were these groups of type two genetics like Harlequin
[27:57.980 --> 27:59.980]  that were THC and CBD.
[28:00.980 --> 28:05.980]  But when ACDC first showed up, that revolutionized California cannabis
[28:06.980 --> 28:10.980]  because that led to it being used as an effective treatment for epilepsy
[28:10.980 --> 28:11.980]  and seizures.
[28:11.980 --> 28:13.980]  And people started to ask, what is this?
[28:14.020 --> 28:15.020]  And it's pure CBD.
[28:16.020 --> 28:19.020]  And then, you know, Gupta does the, you know,
[28:21.020 --> 28:23.020]  the CNN special and it takes off.
[28:24.020 --> 28:27.020]  But in the early days when I was just starting in like 2007,
[28:28.020 --> 28:29.020]  we didn't know anything about terpenes.
[28:30.020 --> 28:34.020]  Ethan Russo wrote a paper about it in 2008, 2009,
[28:35.020 --> 28:36.020]  that I just devoured.
[28:37.020 --> 28:40.020]  But until steep hill opened up in the Bay Area,
[28:40.060 --> 28:42.060]  there was no place to test cannabis in California
[28:43.060 --> 28:44.060]  for a cannabinoid or terpene content.
[28:45.060 --> 28:48.060]  But Steve DeAngelo, the best thing he ever did was he got ahead
[28:49.060 --> 28:52.060]  of the curve in cannabis science in California and he opened the first lab.
[28:53.060 --> 28:54.060]  And then that led to the formation of other labs.
[28:55.060 --> 28:57.060]  Folks from steep hill went and formed SC labs.
[28:58.060 --> 29:00.060]  And today there are a lot of reasonably decent labs.
[29:01.060 --> 29:04.060]  There's some pretty bad ones, but there are some good ones.
[29:05.060 --> 29:07.060]  And that allows us to know what's in the plant.
[29:07.100 --> 29:08.100]  And when I started at Cornerstone, we didn't know,
[29:09.100 --> 29:11.100]  but we really tried to pay attention to our patients.
[29:12.100 --> 29:14.100]  And also I was into super exotic genetics.
[29:15.100 --> 29:17.100]  So I was always trying to find land races and weird stuff.
[29:18.100 --> 29:21.100]  And some of those proved to be reasonably effective.
[29:22.100 --> 29:24.100]  I have this note here, medicine then and now,
[29:25.100 --> 29:26.100]  which is what you're speaking to.
[29:27.100 --> 29:29.100]  So do you, so you feel as though you understand
[29:30.100 --> 29:35.100]  the medicinal properties of the products you're dealing with better now?
[29:35.140 --> 29:38.140]  Than you did back in 2007.
[29:39.140 --> 29:40.140]  I assume that's true.
[29:41.140 --> 29:42.140]  Yeah, that's true.
[29:43.140 --> 29:44.140]  But I mean, we have a long way to go.
[29:45.140 --> 29:47.140]  I mean, the thing is, is that our understanding,
[29:48.140 --> 29:50.140]  the thing is, is now that we're starting to understand that
[29:51.140 --> 29:54.140]  the endocannabinoid system in the body does not just consist
[29:55.140 --> 29:59.140]  of endocannabinoid receptors like CB1 and CB2 or the notional CB3.
[29:59.180 --> 30:03.180]  Now that it's actually interacting with a ton of different receptor systems,
[30:04.180 --> 30:07.180]  serotonin, dopamine, it goes on and on.
[30:08.180 --> 30:10.180]  The trip receptors, the thermal receptors.
[30:11.180 --> 30:14.180]  Once you start to see that these combination of plant chemicals
[30:15.180 --> 30:18.180]  are hitting all of these different receptor systems in the body,
[30:19.180 --> 30:22.180]  and that's actually responsible for the pharmacology of cannabis
[30:23.180 --> 30:24.180]  and how it's working as a medicine.
[30:24.220 --> 30:26.220]  You know, and somebody like Alice is looking for results.
[30:27.220 --> 30:31.220]  We're just now coming out of the mist, you know,
[30:32.220 --> 30:37.220]  with doctors like our doctor here, starting to ask the questions.
[30:38.220 --> 30:42.220]  What we're starting to see is we're applying chemistry to outcomes
[30:43.220 --> 30:46.220]  and starting to see patterns, but we have a long way to go.
[30:47.220 --> 30:50.220]  I mean, we're not just looking at the endocannabinoid system
[30:50.260 --> 30:53.260]  and starting to see patterns, but we have a long way to go.
[30:54.260 --> 30:57.260]  I mean, you know, the bottom line is it's still trying to stick a spear
[30:58.260 --> 30:59.260]  in a barrel and get the right fish.
[31:00.260 --> 31:01.260]  You know, it's really tough.
[31:02.260 --> 31:06.260]  Actually, John, that gets to, you had mentioned that before we started
[31:07.260 --> 31:11.260]  that you wrote your first prescription while you were in residency
[31:12.260 --> 31:13.260]  and you kind of thought it was bullshit.
[31:14.260 --> 31:18.260]  So can you talk about kind of the change in kind of perception?
[31:18.300 --> 31:23.300]  Well, the change for me came from the patients that I saw
[31:23.300 --> 31:24.300]  through the years.
[31:26.300 --> 31:32.300]  From a doctor's point of view, we rely on clinical trials,
[31:33.300 --> 31:37.300]  randomly controlled double blind trials to prove if something
[31:38.300 --> 31:40.300]  is medicine, quote unquote medicine.
[31:41.300 --> 31:47.300]  And there have been very, very few clinical trials on cannabis.
[31:48.300 --> 31:51.300]  And that's due to prohibition, federal prohibition.
[31:53.300 --> 31:58.300]  So as a doctor, I've had to switch gears and just take one patient
[31:59.300 --> 32:00.300]  at a time.
[32:01.300 --> 32:06.300]  And over the 20 years of talking to patients, I've seen miracles.
[32:07.300 --> 32:11.300]  That's what convinced me that there is something happening here.
[32:11.340 --> 32:15.340]  But in the end, how am I going to convince other doctors
[32:16.340 --> 32:17.340]  that there's something happening?
[32:18.340 --> 32:21.340]  I've got to start doing these clinical trials.
[32:22.340 --> 32:29.340]  And that requires, number one, consistent medicine from the manufacturers
[32:30.340 --> 32:33.340]  and then, you know, the appropriate studies.
[32:34.340 --> 32:35.340]  So that's where we're headed.
[32:36.340 --> 32:39.340]  You know, we're trying to take these miracle cases
[32:39.380 --> 32:42.380]  and pull them all together into clinical trials
[32:43.380 --> 32:46.380]  so that we can prove that there's actually something happening.
[32:47.380 --> 32:51.380]  But at this point, to your average doctor, cannabis is not proven
[32:52.380 --> 32:53.380]  medicine at this point.
[32:54.380 --> 32:55.380]  And that's the sad part.
[32:56.380 --> 32:59.380]  It's all these years and we're still at step one.
[33:02.380 --> 33:03.380]  True enough.
[33:04.380 --> 33:08.380]  So do you think that we're going to see a lot of people
[33:09.380 --> 33:12.380]  you know, one of the biggest things is when you see these
[33:13.380 --> 33:17.380]  Cochran reviews of cannabis and cannabinoids for different conditions,
[33:18.380 --> 33:21.380]  they always say, oh, these studies, the studies were too small.
[33:22.380 --> 33:24.380]  So if there are any trials at all, they're always too small.
[33:25.380 --> 33:29.380]  Do you think you envision a time when we can do the kind
[33:30.380 --> 33:35.380]  of large scale studies that, you know, the establishment appears to demand?
[33:36.380 --> 33:37.380]  Yeah, absolutely.
[33:37.420 --> 33:42.420]  Well, finding the right product is the first step, you know,
[33:43.420 --> 33:46.420]  and it's like hunting for a needle in a haystack, right?
[33:47.420 --> 33:48.420]  To find that one product.
[33:49.420 --> 33:52.420]  And then, you know, there's a lot of variability in patients.
[33:53.420 --> 33:56.420]  Everyone's got a different genetic makeup and different metabolism.
[33:57.420 --> 33:59.420]  And so it's a many to many problem.
[34:00.420 --> 34:05.420]  And, you know, our approach, I, you know, I founded a research
[34:05.460 --> 34:10.460]  organization five years ago, the Clinical Endocannabinoid System Consortium,
[34:11.460 --> 34:15.460]  mouthful, but what we're doing is we're taking the approach
[34:16.460 --> 34:20.460]  of starting with the patient and crowdsourcing information
[34:21.460 --> 34:24.460]  so that we can help so that that can direct us
[34:25.460 --> 34:28.460]  toward finding that needle in the haystack and then moving forward
[34:29.460 --> 34:33.460]  with that magic product and truly testing it
[34:33.500 --> 34:38.500]  for specific indications like pain or MS or diabetes,
[34:39.500 --> 34:41.500]  whatever claims that are out there.
[34:42.500 --> 34:45.500]  So, yeah, we envision it and we believe that our approach
[34:46.500 --> 34:51.500]  in working backwards, essentially, you know, sampling the huge amount
[34:52.500 --> 34:58.500]  of patients right now that are taking medicine and or taking cannabis
[34:58.540 --> 35:01.540]  and figuring out which ones are having some effect
[35:02.540 --> 35:06.540]  and then starting from there to do the randomly controlled
[35:07.540 --> 35:09.540]  double-blind trials.
[35:10.540 --> 35:11.540]  It's interesting.
[35:11.540 --> 35:12.540]  Can I ask Alice a question?
[35:13.540 --> 35:17.540]  Alice, have you seen your outcomes improve?
[35:18.540 --> 35:21.540]  I mean, 100 percent.
[35:22.540 --> 35:23.540]  100 percent.
[35:24.540 --> 35:26.540]  And what's made the biggest difference for you?
[35:26.580 --> 35:30.580]  Well, like I said, I used to get, you know, here in Los Angeles
[35:31.580 --> 35:34.580]  before all the regulations went down, I would get cannabis
[35:35.580 --> 35:39.580]  that I knew was probably grown by the guy that owned
[35:40.580 --> 35:41.580]  the dispensary at the time.
[35:42.580 --> 35:44.580]  It was Mother Nature's Remedy, I believe they were called.
[35:45.580 --> 35:48.580]  And yeah, you would just get cannabis with like a label,
[35:49.580 --> 35:51.580]  what the strain name was, and that was it.
[35:52.580 --> 35:55.580]  It was much cheaper then, but the effect was like,
[35:56.580 --> 36:00.580]  I would have panic attacks often, you know, which,
[36:01.580 --> 36:05.580]  who knows what I was inhaling, all the stuff that wasn't lab tested.
[36:06.580 --> 36:10.580]  And then it was only about, I would say about two or three years
[36:11.580 --> 36:15.580]  that I've been able to get, you know, somewhat affordable medicine
[36:16.580 --> 36:17.580]  that is regulated.
[36:18.580 --> 36:23.580]  And it's just like my body has never felt better.
[36:23.620 --> 36:26.620]  It's just like every, you know, I can smoke most everything.
[36:27.620 --> 36:30.620]  I still prefer sun-grown cannabis because I feel like
[36:31.620 --> 36:35.620]  there's more therapeutic aspect to it as far as terpene profiles.
[36:36.620 --> 36:39.620]  You know, I feel like indoor medicine is very strong,
[36:40.620 --> 36:42.620]  but it depends on what kind of day I'm having.
[36:43.620 --> 36:48.620]  You know, I have what's called spastic depletion cerebral palsy,
[36:48.660 --> 36:52.660]  so I have a constant body stiffness slash,
[36:53.660 --> 36:56.660]  you know, twitch.
[36:57.660 --> 36:59.660]  And I'm always dealing with, I'm always tired
[37:00.660 --> 37:01.660]  because I'm always moving.
[37:02.660 --> 37:05.660]  So I like a balance of, you know, medicine that's going to relax
[37:06.660 --> 37:08.660]  my body, but also, you know, keep me awake.
[37:09.660 --> 37:10.660]  So it's always a fine balance.
[37:11.660 --> 37:13.660]  You know, like you said, everybody's different, you know,
[37:14.660 --> 37:15.660]  whereas my wife, she has multiple sclerosis
[37:15.700 --> 37:21.700]  and she can medicate all day long and have the strongest stuff
[37:22.700 --> 37:23.700]  and still be great.
[37:24.700 --> 37:27.700]  You know, and I, you know, I feel as far as that's what I,
[37:28.700 --> 37:31.700]  why I started Rolling Stone is because my wife was doing so well.
[37:32.700 --> 37:37.700]  It's, I feel without it, she'd just be bedridden and she's not.
[37:38.700 --> 37:40.700]  I mean, we're able to be our own advocates.
[37:41.700 --> 37:43.700]  I mean, regulated medicine has been amazing.
[37:43.740 --> 37:47.740]  It's just as far as actually making it affordable
[37:48.740 --> 37:49.740]  to patients, it's a joke.
[37:50.740 --> 37:51.740]  Yeah.
[37:52.740 --> 37:53.740]  Okay, great.
[37:54.740 --> 37:57.740]  And from other patients and other people who are also having
[37:58.740 --> 38:00.740]  similar problems paying for it, do you have any,
[38:01.740 --> 38:03.740]  I mean, in your community that you can.
[38:04.740 --> 38:05.740]  Yeah.
[38:05.740 --> 38:08.740]  I mean, I feel like a lot of people where they'll go
[38:09.740 --> 38:11.740]  with like a lesser product or, you know,
[38:11.780 --> 38:16.780]  they won't necessarily maybe get the right med, you know,
[38:17.780 --> 38:19.780]  like you find, like you said, you find the right med
[38:20.780 --> 38:23.780]  and then all of a sudden it's not there anymore or,
[38:24.780 --> 38:27.780]  you know, there's an issue with getting that.
[38:28.780 --> 38:30.780]  But I feel like so, I mean, honestly,
[38:31.780 --> 38:35.780]  I feel like so many people with disabilities and severe illnesses,
[38:36.780 --> 38:39.780]  cannabis doesn't even enter their mind, to be honest with you,
[38:39.820 --> 38:41.820]  which is why when I started my platform,
[38:42.820 --> 38:44.820]  I was like, I don't know, you know, I'm an actor.
[38:45.820 --> 38:46.820]  I don't know if I should get involved in this,
[38:47.820 --> 38:48.820]  you know, blah, blah, blah.
[38:49.820 --> 38:51.820]  But then there were so many people that I already thought
[38:52.820 --> 38:54.820]  were already on that train and they're just not,
[38:55.820 --> 38:58.820]  you know, and it's, it's, we're still learning
[38:59.820 --> 39:03.820]  and we're not even at step one, I think,
[39:04.820 --> 39:07.820]  as far as people with disabilities and illness illnesses go.
[39:07.860 --> 39:12.860]  So that's why I teach from a standpoint of very basic,
[39:13.860 --> 39:16.860]  you know, because most people don't even know what I'm talking about,
[39:17.860 --> 39:20.860]  which is sad because the basic treatment for someone like me
[39:21.860 --> 39:25.860]  would probably be Valium, Baclofen,
[39:26.860 --> 39:28.860]  any of those type medicines where, you know,
[39:29.860 --> 39:31.860]  I would have a lesser quality of life.
[39:32.860 --> 39:36.100]  Wow.
[39:36.140 --> 39:37.140]  Wow.
[39:38.140 --> 39:40.140]  John, you were, you were about to say something.
[39:41.140 --> 39:42.140]  Oh, right.
[39:43.140 --> 39:46.140]  Well, one of my experiences outside of the crisis,
[39:47.140 --> 39:49.140]  the consistency, as Alice just pointed out, you know,
[39:50.140 --> 39:52.140]  she's looking for a medicine, she finds the right medicine
[39:53.140 --> 39:55.140]  and then she goes back and it's not there.
[39:56.140 --> 39:59.140]  As well, you know, I followed patients.
[40:00.140 --> 40:05.140]  I was following a little girl with Lennox-Gustavus seizures.
[40:06.140 --> 40:08.140]  Similar to Charlotte of Charlotte's Web.
[40:09.140 --> 40:12.140]  And we were getting wonderful results.
[40:13.140 --> 40:15.140]  And then, you know, one day the seizures came back
[40:16.140 --> 40:18.140]  and we didn't change the dose or anything.
[40:19.140 --> 40:22.140]  Eventually we found out that the medicine had changed.
[40:23.140 --> 40:26.140]  Like, likely we were following CBD,
[40:27.140 --> 40:29.140]  but because terpenes may be involved,
[40:30.140 --> 40:34.140]  the terpenes likely changed the effect of it.
[40:34.180 --> 40:39.180]  And so, you know, consistency and proper labeling were required,
[40:40.180 --> 40:42.180]  but I don't think the terpene profiles
[40:43.180 --> 40:46.180]  are completely required in California.
[40:47.180 --> 40:49.180]  And so, like we were all saying,
[40:50.180 --> 40:52.180]  we've got a long way to go in really understanding this
[40:53.180 --> 40:56.180]  and making sure that the whole plant,
[40:57.180 --> 40:59.180]  all the active ingredients are considered
[41:00.180 --> 41:01.180]  for our patients' sake.
[41:01.220 --> 41:05.220]  And this is really where I think advocacy groups
[41:06.220 --> 41:08.220]  and the state need to get involved
[41:09.220 --> 41:10.220]  in focusing on the patient
[41:11.220 --> 41:13.220]  and making sure that they're getting the best medicine
[41:14.220 --> 41:15.220]  rather than taxing them, you know,
[41:16.220 --> 41:20.220]  and making sure that they fill the state's coffers.
[41:21.220 --> 41:24.220]  It might be more important to push toward
[41:25.220 --> 41:28.220]  true medical research.
[41:28.260 --> 41:31.260]  I mean, it'd be great if we could actually get some
[41:33.260 --> 41:38.260]  movement behind the not-for-profit medical dispensary.
[41:39.260 --> 41:41.260]  And the thing is, is that, you know,
[41:42.260 --> 41:44.260]  I mean, when I first got into this,
[41:45.260 --> 41:49.260]  the gold standard was WAM up in Santa Cruz,
[41:50.260 --> 41:52.260]  which was for hospice patients,
[41:53.260 --> 41:54.260]  terminal hospice patients,
[41:55.260 --> 41:56.260]  and provided the meds for them.
[41:56.300 --> 41:58.300]  And so, only provided the meds free
[41:59.300 --> 42:00.300]  to those patients.
[42:01.300 --> 42:02.300]  And it was great.
[42:03.300 --> 42:04.300]  But the problem is,
[42:05.300 --> 42:06.300]  it was very, very self-limiting
[42:07.300 --> 42:10.300]  because you can only really meet the needs
[42:11.300 --> 42:12.300]  of X number of patients.
[42:13.300 --> 42:14.300]  But the good news is,
[42:15.300 --> 42:18.300]  I think that the technology that's used
[42:19.300 --> 42:21.300]  to both cultivate and extract cannabis
[42:22.300 --> 42:24.300]  is getting really, really efficient.
[42:24.340 --> 42:27.340]  And so, I think that it may actually
[42:28.340 --> 42:32.340]  make a non-profit dispensary viable
[42:33.340 --> 42:34.340]  shortly.
[42:35.340 --> 42:36.340]  And I think that,
[42:37.340 --> 42:38.340]  I think we got to stop fooling around
[42:39.340 --> 42:40.340]  and basically, you know,
[42:41.340 --> 42:43.340]  medical cannabis post-regulation in
[42:44.340 --> 42:46.340]  California has done the same thing
[42:47.340 --> 42:48.340]  it's done in every state
[42:49.340 --> 42:50.340]  that's seen adult use regulated.
[42:51.340 --> 42:52.340]  It's basically cratered.
[42:52.380 --> 42:53.380]  And,
[42:55.380 --> 42:56.380]  because everybody's trying to
[42:57.380 --> 42:58.380]  recoup their investments
[42:59.380 --> 43:00.380]  and make their investors happy
[43:01.380 --> 43:02.380]  and all this crap,
[43:02.380 --> 43:03.380]  and the patients suffer.
[43:04.380 --> 43:05.380]  And I think that the thing that really is,
[43:06.380 --> 43:07.380]  we should really start to treat this
[43:08.380 --> 43:09.380]  like medicine.
[43:10.380 --> 43:11.380]  And medicine that we need
[43:12.380 --> 43:13.380]  to make affordable for patients.
[43:14.380 --> 43:15.380]  And,
[43:16.380 --> 43:17.380]  it's really gonna be challenging.
[43:18.380 --> 43:19.380]  Well, I'm down if you guys want to
[43:20.380 --> 43:21.380]  start that non-for-profit
[43:22.380 --> 43:23.380]  I'm young.
[43:23.380 --> 43:24.380]  I've got a lot of years left in me.
[43:25.380 --> 43:26.380]  Yeah, I'm old.
[43:26.380 --> 43:27.380]  I don't, but
[43:28.380 --> 43:30.380]  it doesn't mean I'm not down for it.
[43:31.380 --> 43:32.380]  It's the, yeah,
[43:33.380 --> 43:34.380]  it's something I'd love to spend more time on.
[43:36.380 --> 43:37.380]  The,
[43:38.380 --> 43:39.380]  yeah, it's really,
[43:39.380 --> 43:40.380]  I work with a dispensary in Hawaii
[43:41.380 --> 43:42.380]  and,
[43:43.380 --> 43:44.380]  it's been really challenging there
[43:44.380 --> 43:45.380]  because it's so highly regulated
[43:46.380 --> 43:47.380]  that it's really expensive
[43:48.380 --> 43:49.380]  to produce medicine.
[43:49.420 --> 43:50.420]  And,
[43:51.420 --> 43:52.420]  but in California,
[43:52.420 --> 43:53.420]  I mean,
[43:53.420 --> 43:54.420]  we've got,
[43:54.420 --> 43:56.420]  Central Valley has lots of room to grow
[43:57.420 --> 43:58.420]  non-for-profit cannabis.
[43:59.420 --> 44:00.420]  So.
[44:02.420 --> 44:03.420]  Are,
[44:04.420 --> 44:05.420]  are there any,
[44:06.420 --> 44:07.420]  I mean,
[44:07.420 --> 44:08.420]  I know everyone was a collective
[44:09.420 --> 44:11.420]  and not-for-profit up until a certain point.
[44:12.420 --> 44:13.420]  It kind of seems like everything
[44:14.420 --> 44:15.420]  shifted in the other direction.
[44:16.420 --> 44:17.420]  So are there
[44:17.460 --> 44:18.460]  are there still,
[44:19.460 --> 44:20.460]  could one be a not-for-profit
[44:21.460 --> 44:22.460]  retail shop
[44:23.460 --> 44:24.460]  in California?
[44:25.460 --> 44:26.460]  Well,
[44:26.460 --> 44:27.460]  I mean,
[44:27.460 --> 44:28.460]  I think
[44:29.460 --> 44:30.460]  Sarah may be able to address that,
[44:31.460 --> 44:32.460]  but I think so because with the recent
[44:33.460 --> 44:34.460]  changes in state laws,
[44:35.460 --> 44:36.460]  with the return of the compassion programs,
[44:37.460 --> 44:38.460]  I think there actually is room
[44:39.460 --> 44:40.460]  now for this to
[44:41.460 --> 44:42.460]  get some traction.
[44:43.460 --> 44:44.460]  And,
[44:44.460 --> 44:45.460]  yeah,
[44:45.460 --> 44:46.460]  it just takes
[44:46.500 --> 44:47.500]  just takes willpower right now.
[44:48.500 --> 44:49.500]  I mean,
[44:49.500 --> 44:50.500]  and,
[44:50.500 --> 44:51.500]  and money.
[44:51.500 --> 44:52.500]  I mean,
[44:52.500 --> 44:53.500]  it's going to take some money to set it up,
[44:53.500 --> 44:54.500]  but,
[44:54.500 --> 44:55.500]  but,
[44:55.500 --> 44:56.500]  you know,
[44:56.500 --> 44:57.500]  it's not going to be all the fancy flavor
[44:57.500 --> 44:58.500]  products.
[44:58.500 --> 44:59.500]  It's going to be looking at this as a,
[44:59.500 --> 45:00.500]  as a medicine
[45:00.500 --> 45:01.500]  and saying,
[45:01.500 --> 45:02.500]  okay,
[45:02.500 --> 45:03.500]  what are the ingredients we really need?
[45:04.500 --> 45:05.500]  And what do the patients need?
[45:06.500 --> 45:07.500]  And how can we get those formulations
[45:08.500 --> 45:09.500]  to patients?
[45:09.500 --> 45:10.500]  And so it's kind of bare bones.
[45:10.500 --> 45:11.500]  It's very,
[45:11.500 --> 45:12.500]  it'd be very generic.
[45:13.500 --> 45:14.500]  Okay.
[45:14.500 --> 45:15.500]  But I think it'd be highly effective
[45:15.540 --> 45:16.540]  because chemistry is chemistry.
[45:17.540 --> 45:18.540]  I,
[45:18.540 --> 45:19.540]  you know,
[45:19.540 --> 45:20.540]  I think that's a,
[45:20.540 --> 45:21.540]  the average patient kind of maybe
[45:21.540 --> 45:22.540]  wants generic.
[45:22.540 --> 45:23.540]  I think with a lot of
[45:24.540 --> 45:25.540]  how it is now when you go on dispensers,
[45:26.540 --> 45:27.540]  there's so many brands
[45:27.540 --> 45:28.540]  that you get intimidated.
[45:30.540 --> 45:31.540]  So if you,
[45:31.540 --> 45:32.540]  if you get generic,
[45:32.540 --> 45:33.540]  you know,
[45:33.540 --> 45:34.540]  generic stuff,
[45:34.540 --> 45:35.540]  it makes it easier for the patient,
[45:35.540 --> 45:36.540]  I think.
[45:36.540 --> 45:37.540]  Yeah.
[45:37.540 --> 45:38.540]  Maybe that's,
[45:38.540 --> 45:39.540]  maybe that's the,
[45:39.540 --> 45:40.540]  you know,
[45:40.540 --> 45:41.540]  remember the,
[45:41.540 --> 45:42.540]  remember the,
[45:42.540 --> 45:43.540]  the first generic products in the grocery store
[45:43.540 --> 45:44.540]  with the white boxes
[45:44.580 --> 45:45.580]  and the letters.
[45:46.580 --> 45:47.580]  So maybe it's literally
[45:47.580 --> 45:48.580]  THC,
[45:48.580 --> 45:49.580]  CBD,
[45:49.580 --> 45:50.580]  myrcene,
[45:50.580 --> 45:51.580]  and a little lemonade.
[45:52.580 --> 45:53.580]  And yeah.
[45:53.580 --> 45:54.580]  And the numbers on the back
[45:54.580 --> 45:55.580]  and you take it from there.
[45:55.580 --> 45:56.580]  I mean,
[45:56.580 --> 45:57.580]  who knows?
[45:57.580 --> 45:58.580]  Maybe that's a,
[45:58.580 --> 45:59.580]  maybe that's a business opportunity
[45:59.580 --> 46:00.580]  for somebody.
[46:00.580 --> 46:01.580]  Well,
[46:01.580 --> 46:02.580]  you know,
[46:02.580 --> 46:03.580]  and the fact is now
[46:03.580 --> 46:04.580]  brands or you,
[46:04.580 --> 46:06.580]  you don't know what's in that brand
[46:06.580 --> 46:08.580]  just because it has a brand on it.
[46:09.580 --> 46:10.580]  They could be sourcing
[46:11.580 --> 46:12.580]  from other people.
[46:12.580 --> 46:13.580]  We know for a fact they are.
[46:13.620 --> 46:14.620]  We know they are.
[46:14.620 --> 46:16.620]  So you don't necessarily know.
[46:16.620 --> 46:18.620]  The butt tender may not know.
[46:18.620 --> 46:19.620]  No one may,
[46:19.620 --> 46:20.620]  in that shop,
[46:20.620 --> 46:22.620]  may know exactly what's in that jar.
[46:23.620 --> 46:24.620]  Well,
[46:24.620 --> 46:26.620]  and also a sad truth is a lot of the labs
[46:26.620 --> 46:27.620]  that are testing the medicine
[46:28.620 --> 46:30.620]  are incentivized
[46:31.620 --> 46:33.620]  to provide
[46:33.620 --> 46:34.620]  the results
[46:36.620 --> 46:37.620]  that the people who are paying
[46:37.620 --> 46:39.620]  for the testing want.
[46:40.620 --> 46:42.620]  And therefore my concern is
[46:42.660 --> 46:43.660]  sometimes you don't,
[46:43.660 --> 46:44.660]  like for example,
[46:44.660 --> 46:45.660]  you know,
[46:45.660 --> 46:47.660]  some of these labs are terpene testing
[46:47.660 --> 46:49.660]  and they get results
[46:49.660 --> 46:51.660]  that don't line up
[46:51.660 --> 46:52.660]  with the genetics
[46:52.660 --> 46:55.660]  of what the plant can actually produce.
[46:56.660 --> 46:57.660]  And that's a big deal
[46:57.660 --> 46:59.660]  because it means that the results,
[46:59.660 --> 47:01.660]  if they even get to the patient,
[47:02.660 --> 47:04.660]  will incorrectly
[47:04.660 --> 47:05.660]  inform them
[47:05.660 --> 47:07.660]  about the constituency of the product.
[47:07.660 --> 47:09.660]  And that's awful.
[47:10.660 --> 47:11.660]  And so
[47:11.700 --> 47:12.700]  more
[47:13.700 --> 47:14.700]  oversight
[47:14.700 --> 47:16.700]  over lab testing in California
[47:16.700 --> 47:18.700]  is this is the right time for it.
[47:19.700 --> 47:20.700]  Especially if we really want to start
[47:20.700 --> 47:22.700]  to talk about this as a medicine.
[47:22.700 --> 47:23.700]  Not knowing what's in your product
[47:23.700 --> 47:25.700]  can really be problematic for patients.
[47:28.700 --> 47:29.700]  Sarah, are you there?
[47:31.700 --> 47:32.700]  Yeah, I'm here.
[47:32.700 --> 47:34.700]  So are those the types
[47:34.700 --> 47:35.700]  of conversations
[47:35.700 --> 47:36.700]  you're like,
[47:36.700 --> 47:37.700]  that ISA is having
[47:37.700 --> 47:38.700]  with the state
[47:38.700 --> 47:39.700]  about
[47:39.740 --> 47:41.740]  putting some of those practices
[47:42.740 --> 47:43.740]  back into play
[47:43.740 --> 47:44.740]  or
[47:44.740 --> 47:45.740]  refocusing
[47:45.740 --> 47:46.740]  or emphasizing them?
[47:47.740 --> 47:48.740]  You know,
[47:48.740 --> 47:49.740]  I had a conversation
[47:49.740 --> 47:51.740]  a couple of years ago
[47:52.740 --> 47:53.740]  with Steph
[47:53.740 --> 47:55.740]  and she told me that
[47:55.740 --> 47:57.740]  after all of the work
[47:57.740 --> 47:58.740]  that ISA had done in states
[47:58.740 --> 47:59.740]  when they went wreck,
[48:00.740 --> 48:01.740]  they had to always go,
[48:01.740 --> 48:03.740]  you always had to go back
[48:03.740 --> 48:04.740]  into those same states
[48:04.740 --> 48:06.740]  to redo the work
[48:06.740 --> 48:08.740]  you had done previously.
[48:09.740 --> 48:10.740]  She wasn't lying.
[48:12.740 --> 48:13.740]  I think
[48:15.740 --> 48:16.740]  the first
[48:17.740 --> 48:18.740]  draft of the regs
[48:18.740 --> 48:19.740]  in California
[48:19.740 --> 48:20.740]  I wrote a 44 page
[48:20.740 --> 48:21.740]  response
[48:22.740 --> 48:23.740]  pointing out to them
[48:24.740 --> 48:25.740]  the changes I thought
[48:25.740 --> 48:26.740]  were necessary.
[48:28.740 --> 48:29.740]  Sometimes
[48:31.740 --> 48:33.740]  things are going to take a while
[48:33.740 --> 48:35.740]  and you have to come up
[48:35.740 --> 48:36.740]  with a fix.
[48:36.780 --> 48:37.780]  And ISA is good at this
[48:39.780 --> 48:40.780]  but a fix
[48:40.780 --> 48:41.780]  is not a solution.
[48:42.780 --> 48:43.780]  I'll give you an example.
[48:44.780 --> 48:45.780]  In state law
[48:45.780 --> 48:46.780]  I wrote and got
[48:46.780 --> 48:47.780]  past a piece
[48:47.780 --> 48:48.780]  that allows
[48:48.780 --> 48:49.780]  patients
[48:49.780 --> 48:50.780]  to take their medicine
[48:50.780 --> 48:51.780]  to a lab.
[48:51.780 --> 48:52.780]  You take your reg
[48:52.780 --> 48:53.780]  you go to the lab
[48:53.780 --> 48:54.780]  they'll test it.
[48:57.780 --> 48:58.780]  That's fine
[48:58.780 --> 48:59.780]  that's great
[48:59.780 --> 49:00.780]  but it's expensive.
[49:01.780 --> 49:02.780]  But it does
[49:02.780 --> 49:03.780]  give patients
[49:03.780 --> 49:04.780]  a chance
[49:04.780 --> 49:05.780]  to come up
[49:05.820 --> 49:06.820]  with a solution.
[49:07.820 --> 49:08.820]  It does give
[49:08.820 --> 49:09.820]  patients who are
[49:09.820 --> 49:10.820]  buying in unlicensed
[49:10.820 --> 49:11.820]  stores
[49:11.820 --> 49:12.820]  an opportunity
[49:13.820 --> 49:14.820]  to make sure
[49:14.820 --> 49:15.820]  what they've got
[49:15.820 --> 49:16.820]  is safe.
[49:16.820 --> 49:17.820]  Now that's a fix
[49:17.820 --> 49:18.820]  that's not a solution.
[49:19.820 --> 49:20.820]  And it's that
[49:20.820 --> 49:21.820]  kind of
[49:21.820 --> 49:22.820]  gotta get it done
[49:22.820 --> 49:23.820]  right now
[49:23.820 --> 49:24.820]  gotta protect
[49:24.820 --> 49:25.820]  the patients
[49:25.820 --> 49:26.820]  what can we do
[49:26.820 --> 49:27.820]  that sort of
[49:27.820 --> 49:28.820]  drives
[49:29.820 --> 49:30.820]  the conversation.
[49:31.820 --> 49:32.820]  And
[49:32.820 --> 49:33.820]  one of the
[49:33.820 --> 49:34.820]  great gifts
[49:34.860 --> 49:35.860]  when Joe Baca
[49:35.860 --> 49:36.860]  shows up
[49:36.860 --> 49:37.860]  and really knows
[49:37.860 --> 49:38.860]  his stuff
[49:38.860 --> 49:39.860]  the conversation
[49:39.860 --> 49:40.860]  starts to point
[49:40.860 --> 49:41.860]  towards
[49:41.860 --> 49:42.860]  solutions
[49:42.860 --> 49:43.860]  rather than
[49:43.860 --> 49:44.860]  fixes.
[49:45.860 --> 49:46.860]  And I can't wait.
[49:47.860 --> 49:48.860]  I'm
[49:48.860 --> 49:49.860]  66 years old
[49:49.860 --> 49:50.860]  I'm riddled
[49:50.860 --> 49:51.860]  with arthritis
[49:52.860 --> 49:53.860]  if we don't get
[49:53.860 --> 49:54.860]  this done soon
[49:54.860 --> 49:55.860]  I may not
[49:55.860 --> 49:56.860]  live to see it
[49:56.860 --> 49:57.860]  happen.
[49:57.860 --> 49:58.860]  So
[49:58.860 --> 49:59.860]  I'm particularly
[49:59.860 --> 50:00.860]  incentivized
[50:00.860 --> 50:01.860]  to interact
[50:01.860 --> 50:02.860]  with the
[50:02.900 --> 50:03.900]  regulators
[50:03.900 --> 50:04.900]  at the state level
[50:05.900 --> 50:06.900]  I really
[50:06.900 --> 50:07.900]  really pay attention
[50:07.900 --> 50:08.900]  to what's going
[50:08.900 --> 50:09.900]  on there.
[50:10.900 --> 50:11.900]  I have the gift
[50:11.900 --> 50:12.900]  of one of the
[50:12.900 --> 50:13.900]  great lobbyists
[50:13.900 --> 50:14.900]  in Sacramento
[50:14.900 --> 50:15.900]  Don Duncan
[50:16.900 --> 50:17.900]  and another
[50:17.900 --> 50:18.900]  organization
[50:18.900 --> 50:19.900]  I'm aligned with
[50:19.900 --> 50:20.900]  the Southern
[50:20.900 --> 50:21.900]  California Coalition
[50:21.900 --> 50:22.900]  has lobbyists
[50:22.900 --> 50:23.900]  who have advocacy.
[50:24.900 --> 50:25.900]  So at least
[50:26.900 --> 50:27.900]  people pay attention
[50:27.900 --> 50:28.900]  when we're talking
[50:28.900 --> 50:29.900]  people pay attention
[50:29.900 --> 50:30.900]  when we weigh in
[50:30.940 --> 50:31.940]  we are no longer
[50:31.940 --> 50:32.940]  referred to
[50:32.940 --> 50:33.940]  as drug dealing
[50:33.940 --> 50:34.940]  tax cheats.
[50:36.940 --> 50:37.940]  And that's only
[50:37.940 --> 50:38.940]  going to get better.
[50:38.940 --> 50:39.940]  I think one thing
[50:39.940 --> 50:40.940]  that it's ironic
[50:40.940 --> 50:41.940]  that we're talking
[50:41.940 --> 50:42.940]  about this
[50:42.940 --> 50:43.940]  but you know
[50:43.940 --> 50:44.940]  when Dennis Perone
[50:45.940 --> 50:46.940]  started the first
[50:46.940 --> 50:47.940]  Cannabis Buyers Club
[50:48.940 --> 50:49.940]  as he called it
[50:49.940 --> 50:50.940]  in California
[50:51.940 --> 50:52.940]  maybe the
[50:52.940 --> 50:53.940]  best solution
[50:54.940 --> 50:55.940]  to helping patients
[50:55.940 --> 50:56.940]  is the return
[50:57.940 --> 50:58.940]  of the Cannabis
[50:58.940 --> 50:59.940]  Buyers Club
[50:59.980 --> 51:00.980]  where cannabis
[51:00.980 --> 51:01.980]  patients get together
[51:01.980 --> 51:02.980]  pool their money
[51:03.980 --> 51:04.980]  and get
[51:05.980 --> 51:06.980]  you know
[51:06.980 --> 51:07.980]  legal
[51:07.980 --> 51:08.980]  legal medical cannabis
[51:08.980 --> 51:09.980]  and and
[51:10.980 --> 51:11.980]  basically it is
[51:11.980 --> 51:12.980]  a not-for-profit
[51:12.980 --> 51:13.980]  but it's literally
[51:13.980 --> 51:14.980]  a buyers club
[51:14.980 --> 51:15.980]  it's it's the power
[51:15.980 --> 51:16.980]  of of patients
[51:16.980 --> 51:17.980]  coming together
[51:18.980 --> 51:19.980]  to get the medicine
[51:19.980 --> 51:20.980]  they need.
[51:20.980 --> 51:21.980]  And it sounds a little
[51:21.980 --> 51:22.980]  And they can then
[51:22.980 --> 51:23.980]  afford their own testing.
[51:23.980 --> 51:24.980]  Yeah but the great
[51:24.980 --> 51:25.980]  thing is testing
[51:25.980 --> 51:26.980]  has gotten
[51:26.980 --> 51:27.980]  I mean testing
[51:27.980 --> 51:28.980]  is very competitive
[51:29.020 --> 51:30.020]  right now
[51:30.020 --> 51:31.020]  and what's interesting
[51:31.020 --> 51:32.020]  is the
[51:32.020 --> 51:33.020]  all the labs
[51:33.020 --> 51:34.020]  good and bad
[51:35.020 --> 51:36.020]  it's a very
[51:36.020 --> 51:37.020]  competitive market
[51:37.020 --> 51:38.020]  so the good news
[51:38.020 --> 51:39.020]  is the cost
[51:39.020 --> 51:40.020]  of good testing
[51:40.020 --> 51:41.020]  is coming down
[51:41.020 --> 51:42.020]  just like the cost
[51:42.020 --> 51:43.020]  of bad testing
[51:43.020 --> 51:44.020]  is coming down
[51:44.020 --> 51:45.020]  and so
[51:45.020 --> 51:46.020]  so what's great
[51:46.020 --> 51:47.020]  is is that
[51:48.020 --> 51:49.020]  it's it's much
[51:49.020 --> 51:50.020]  more viable now
[51:50.020 --> 51:51.020]  and I mean it
[51:51.020 --> 51:52.020]  really addresses
[51:52.020 --> 51:53.020]  you know
[51:53.020 --> 51:54.020]  what Allison
[51:54.020 --> 51:55.020]  and Sarah
[51:55.020 --> 51:56.020]  are talking about
[51:56.020 --> 51:57.020]  in that
[51:57.020 --> 51:58.020]  it provides
[51:58.060 --> 51:59.060]  it provides
[51:59.060 --> 52:00.060]  safe affordable
[52:00.060 --> 52:01.060]  access which was
[52:01.060 --> 52:02.060]  the whole game
[52:02.060 --> 52:03.060]  the whole reason
[52:03.060 --> 52:04.060]  this whole thing
[52:04.060 --> 52:05.060]  exists is because
[52:05.060 --> 52:06.060]  of that but maybe
[52:06.060 --> 52:07.060]  it's time to go
[52:07.060 --> 52:08.060]  back to first
[52:08.060 --> 52:09.060]  principles there
[52:09.060 --> 52:10.060]  and
[52:10.060 --> 52:11.060]  or is a
[52:11.060 --> 52:12.060]  a non-profit
[52:12.060 --> 52:13.060]  dispensary
[52:13.060 --> 52:14.060]  a shop
[52:14.060 --> 52:15.060]  allowed in
[52:15.060 --> 52:16.060]  California
[52:16.060 --> 52:17.060]  now
[52:17.060 --> 52:18.060]  Sarah
[52:18.060 --> 52:19.060]  I thought
[52:19.060 --> 52:20.060]  that
[52:20.060 --> 52:21.060]  64
[52:21.060 --> 52:22.060]  when it did
[52:22.060 --> 52:23.060]  away with collectives
[52:23.060 --> 52:24.060]  that it mandated
[52:24.060 --> 52:25.060]  that that shops
[52:25.060 --> 52:26.060]  had to be
[52:26.060 --> 52:27.060]  for-profit
[52:27.100 --> 52:28.100]  has that been
[52:28.100 --> 52:29.100]  changed
[52:29.100 --> 52:30.100]  or
[52:30.100 --> 52:31.100]  I think
[52:31.100 --> 52:32.100]  what they were
[52:32.100 --> 52:33.100]  trying to do
[52:33.100 --> 52:34.100]  is change
[52:34.100 --> 52:35.100]  it from
[52:35.100 --> 52:36.100]  whatever
[52:36.100 --> 52:37.100]  it was
[52:37.100 --> 52:38.100]  to a viable
[52:38.100 --> 52:39.100]  industry
[52:39.100 --> 52:40.100]  and my
[52:40.100 --> 52:41.100]  understanding
[52:41.100 --> 52:42.100]  is that
[52:42.100 --> 52:43.100]  you can
[52:43.100 --> 52:44.100]  still form
[52:44.100 --> 52:45.100]  a small
[52:45.100 --> 52:46.100]  endeavor
[52:46.100 --> 52:47.100]  with four
[52:47.100 --> 52:48.100]  or five
[52:48.100 --> 52:49.100]  friends
[52:49.100 --> 52:50.100]  and and
[52:50.100 --> 52:51.100]  go forward
[52:51.100 --> 52:52.100]  the problem
[52:52.100 --> 52:53.100]  is that
[52:53.100 --> 52:54.100]  the longer
[52:54.100 --> 52:55.100]  we wait
[52:55.100 --> 52:56.100]  to establish
[52:56.140 --> 52:57.140]  affordable
[52:57.140 --> 52:58.140]  safe
[52:58.140 --> 52:59.140]  access
[52:59.140 --> 53:00.140]  the harder
[53:00.140 --> 53:01.140]  it's going to
[53:01.140 --> 53:02.140]  become
[53:02.140 --> 53:03.140]  because
[53:03.140 --> 53:04.140]  as the
[53:04.140 --> 53:05.140]  industry
[53:05.140 --> 53:06.140]  coalesces
[53:06.140 --> 53:07.140]  people who
[53:07.140 --> 53:08.140]  have retail
[53:08.140 --> 53:09.140]  licenses
[53:09.140 --> 53:10.140]  things like
[53:10.140 --> 53:11.140]  that aren't
[53:11.140 --> 53:12.140]  going to be too
[53:12.140 --> 53:13.140]  pleased about
[53:13.140 --> 53:14.140]  the idea
[53:14.140 --> 53:15.140]  that somebody
[53:15.140 --> 53:16.140]  is coming in
[53:16.140 --> 53:17.140]  who can
[53:17.140 --> 53:18.140]  undercut them
[53:18.140 --> 53:19.140]  and they don't
[53:19.140 --> 53:20.140]  really think
[53:20.140 --> 53:21.140]  about it as
[53:21.140 --> 53:22.140]  being medicine
[53:22.140 --> 53:23.140]  that patients
[53:23.140 --> 53:24.140]  who don't have
[53:24.140 --> 53:25.140]  a lot of money
[53:25.180 --> 53:26.180]  or a lot
[53:26.180 --> 53:27.180]  of need
[53:27.180 --> 53:28.180]  they think of it
[53:28.180 --> 53:29.180]  as
[53:29.180 --> 53:30.180]  taking away
[53:30.180 --> 53:31.180]  from their
[53:31.180 --> 53:32.180]  market share
[53:32.180 --> 53:33.180]  and the more
[53:33.180 --> 53:34.180]  you have
[53:34.180 --> 53:35.180]  consolidation
[53:35.180 --> 53:36.180]  and you see
[53:36.180 --> 53:37.180]  this very clearly
[53:37.180 --> 53:38.180]  in Los Angeles
[53:38.180 --> 53:39.180]  it's really
[53:39.180 --> 53:40.180]  interesting
[53:40.180 --> 53:41.180]  how many
[53:41.180 --> 53:42.180]  places
[53:42.180 --> 53:43.180]  we have
[53:43.180 --> 53:44.180]  now
[53:44.180 --> 53:45.180]  that have
[53:45.180 --> 53:46.180]  dispensaries
[53:46.180 --> 53:47.180]  not only
[53:47.180 --> 53:48.180]  in California
[53:48.180 --> 53:49.180]  but
[53:49.180 --> 53:50.180]  Arizona
[53:50.180 --> 53:51.180]  all kinds
[53:51.180 --> 53:52.180]  of places
[53:52.180 --> 53:53.180]  so there has
[53:53.180 --> 53:54.180]  to be
[53:54.220 --> 53:55.220]  a mix
[53:55.220 --> 53:56.220]  of the minds
[53:56.220 --> 53:57.220]  between the
[53:57.220 --> 53:58.220]  industry
[53:58.220 --> 53:59.220]  and those
[53:59.220 --> 54:00.220]  who are just
[54:00.220 --> 54:01.220]  not capable
[54:01.220 --> 54:02.220]  because they are
[54:02.220 --> 54:03.220]  sick and they
[54:03.220 --> 54:04.220]  are poor
[54:04.220 --> 54:05.220]  of being
[54:05.220 --> 54:06.220]  much of the
[54:06.220 --> 54:07.220]  market share
[54:07.220 --> 54:08.220]  and that's
[54:08.220 --> 54:09.220]  one of the
[54:09.220 --> 54:10.220]  conversations
[54:10.220 --> 54:11.220]  I'd like to
[54:11.220 --> 54:12.220]  start having
[54:12.220 --> 54:13.220]  sooner rather
[54:13.220 --> 54:14.220]  than later
[54:14.220 --> 54:15.220]  because it's
[54:15.220 --> 54:16.220]  hard enough
[54:16.220 --> 54:17.220]  right now
[54:17.220 --> 54:18.220]  and
[54:18.220 --> 54:19.220]  until we see
[54:19.220 --> 54:20.220]  how many
[54:20.220 --> 54:21.220]  places in LA
[54:21.220 --> 54:22.220]  are going to
[54:22.220 --> 54:23.220]  have true
[54:23.260 --> 54:24.260]  how much
[54:24.260 --> 54:25.260]  of the lift
[54:25.260 --> 54:26.260]  they are going
[54:26.260 --> 54:27.260]  to be able
[54:27.260 --> 54:28.260]  to do
[54:28.260 --> 54:29.260]  it's kind of
[54:29.260 --> 54:30.260]  hard to go
[54:30.260 --> 54:31.260]  rushing in
[54:31.260 --> 54:32.260]  and go
[54:32.260 --> 54:33.260]  okay change
[54:33.260 --> 54:34.260]  everything right
[54:34.260 --> 54:35.260]  now
[54:35.260 --> 54:36.260]  this isn't
[54:36.260 --> 54:37.260]  working
[54:37.260 --> 54:38.260]  change everything
[54:38.260 --> 54:39.260]  and I have
[54:39.260 --> 54:40.260]  seen
[54:40.260 --> 54:41.260]  excuse me
[54:41.260 --> 54:42.260]  enough will
[54:42.260 --> 54:43.260]  particularly
[54:43.260 --> 54:44.260]  among veteran
[54:44.260 --> 54:45.260]  operators
[54:45.260 --> 54:46.260]  to have
[54:46.260 --> 54:47.260]  meaningful
[54:47.260 --> 54:48.260]  compassion
[54:48.260 --> 54:49.260]  programs
[54:49.260 --> 54:50.260]  that I would
[54:50.260 --> 54:51.260]  sort of like
[54:51.260 --> 54:52.260]  to go down
[54:52.300 --> 54:53.300]  in this
[54:53.300 --> 54:54.300]  time
[54:54.300 --> 54:55.300]  in this
[54:55.300 --> 54:56.300]  place
[54:56.300 --> 54:57.300]  the only road
[54:57.300 --> 54:58.300]  we have
[54:58.300 --> 54:59.300]  going forward
[54:59.300 --> 55:00.300]  we have to
[55:00.300 --> 55:01.300]  see what
[55:01.300 --> 55:02.300]  COVID does
[55:02.300 --> 55:03.300]  and we have
[55:03.300 --> 55:04.300]  to see what
[55:04.300 --> 55:05.300]  the will of
[55:05.300 --> 55:06.300]  the governor
[55:06.300 --> 55:07.300]  is and the
[55:07.300 --> 55:08.300]  legislature
[55:08.300 --> 55:09.300]  there's a lot
[55:09.300 --> 55:10.300]  of moving
[55:10.300 --> 55:11.300]  parts
[55:11.300 --> 55:12.300]  so like
[55:12.300 --> 55:13.300]  Michael says
[55:13.300 --> 55:14.300]  you got to
[55:14.300 --> 55:15.300]  go in and
[55:15.300 --> 55:16.300]  ask for it
[55:16.300 --> 55:17.300]  compassion
[55:17.300 --> 55:18.300]  is not going
[55:18.300 --> 55:19.300]  to be on
[55:19.300 --> 55:20.300]  that board
[55:20.300 --> 55:21.300]  so
[55:21.340 --> 55:22.340]  I'm hoping
[55:22.340 --> 55:23.340]  that by
[55:23.340 --> 55:24.340]  sometime next
[55:24.340 --> 55:25.340]  year
[55:25.340 --> 55:26.340]  we'll have
[55:26.340 --> 55:27.340]  compassion
[55:27.340 --> 55:28.340]  programs all
[55:28.340 --> 55:29.340]  over Los
[55:29.340 --> 55:30.340]  Angeles
[55:30.340 --> 55:31.340]  and even if
[55:31.340 --> 55:32.340]  they don't
[55:32.340 --> 55:33.340]  cure the
[55:33.340 --> 55:34.340]  problem at
[55:34.340 --> 55:35.340]  least they'll
[55:35.340 --> 55:36.340]  address it to
[55:36.340 --> 55:37.340]  a certain
[55:37.340 --> 55:38.340]  extent
[55:38.340 --> 55:39.340]  the legislature
[55:39.340 --> 55:40.340]  this year
[55:40.340 --> 55:41.340]  is not
[55:41.340 --> 55:42.340]  addressing
[55:42.340 --> 55:43.340]  anything but
[55:43.340 --> 55:44.340]  COVID wildfires
[55:44.340 --> 55:45.340]  and homelessness
[55:45.340 --> 55:46.340]  they're asking
[55:46.340 --> 55:47.340]  specifically that
[55:47.340 --> 55:48.340]  people pare
[55:48.340 --> 55:49.340]  down their
[55:49.340 --> 55:50.340]  legislative
[55:50.380 --> 55:51.380]  priorities
[55:51.380 --> 55:52.380]  and
[55:52.380 --> 55:53.380]  accommodate
[55:53.380 --> 55:54.380]  that
[55:54.380 --> 55:55.380]  and what it
[55:55.380 --> 55:56.380]  means is that
[55:56.380 --> 55:57.380]  again and again
[55:57.380 --> 55:58.380]  I'm being told
[55:58.380 --> 55:59.380]  by people well
[55:59.380 --> 56:00.380]  we're not going
[56:00.380 --> 56:01.380]  forward with that
[56:01.380 --> 56:02.380]  cannabis bill
[56:02.380 --> 56:03.380]  so we're in
[56:03.380 --> 56:04.380]  tough spot but
[56:04.380 --> 56:05.380]  if we keep
[56:05.380 --> 56:06.380]  going forward
[56:06.380 --> 56:07.380]  together we will
[56:07.380 --> 56:08.380]  get somewhere
[56:08.380 --> 56:09.380]  soon
[56:09.380 --> 56:10.380]  I mean I think
[56:10.380 --> 56:11.380]  also in the
[56:11.380 --> 56:12.380]  interim I think
[56:12.380 --> 56:13.380]  we should hack
[56:13.380 --> 56:14.380]  the system
[56:14.380 --> 56:15.380]  because I mean
[56:15.380 --> 56:16.380]  as Alice knows
[56:16.380 --> 56:17.380]  I mean she's
[56:17.380 --> 56:18.380]  found value
[56:18.380 --> 56:19.380]  products out
[56:19.420 --> 56:20.420]  there and I
[56:20.420 --> 56:21.420]  don't want to put
[56:21.420 --> 56:22.420]  words in your
[56:22.420 --> 56:23.420]  mouth but you
[56:23.420 --> 56:24.420]  know when you
[56:24.420 --> 56:25.420]  talk about
[56:25.420 --> 56:26.420]  companies like
[56:26.420 --> 56:27.420]  raw garden
[56:27.420 --> 56:28.420]  which I have
[56:28.420 --> 56:29.420]  nothing to do
[56:29.420 --> 56:30.420]  with except
[56:30.420 --> 56:31.420]  for admiring
[56:31.420 --> 56:32.420]  the fact that
[56:32.420 --> 56:33.420]  they can bring
[56:33.420 --> 56:34.420]  a reasonably priced
[56:34.420 --> 56:35.420]  high potency
[56:35.420 --> 56:36.420]  product to
[56:36.420 --> 56:37.420]  market
[56:37.420 --> 56:38.420]  it's almost
[56:38.420 --> 56:39.420]  like we need
[56:39.420 --> 56:40.420]  to like you
[56:40.420 --> 56:41.420]  know find
[56:41.420 --> 56:42.420]  those and
[56:42.420 --> 56:43.420]  publicize
[56:43.420 --> 56:44.420]  those because
[56:44.420 --> 56:45.420]  that's what
[56:45.420 --> 56:46.420]  is needed
[56:46.420 --> 56:47.420]  right now
[56:47.420 --> 56:48.420]  until other
[56:48.460 --> 56:49.460]  companies
[56:49.460 --> 56:50.460]  like
[56:50.460 --> 56:51.460]  you know
[56:51.460 --> 56:52.460]  I publicize
[56:52.460 --> 56:53.460]  them all the
[56:53.460 --> 56:54.460]  time on my
[56:54.460 --> 56:55.460]  website
[56:55.460 --> 56:56.460]  but you
[56:56.460 --> 56:57.460]  know Sarah
[56:57.460 --> 56:58.460]  who would I
[56:58.460 --> 56:59.460]  ask
[56:59.460 --> 57:00.460]  who would I
[57:00.460 --> 57:01.460]  bug
[57:01.460 --> 57:02.460]  you know
[57:02.460 --> 57:03.460]  to
[57:03.460 --> 57:04.460]  bring
[57:04.460 --> 57:05.460]  to
[57:05.460 --> 57:06.460]  the
[57:06.460 --> 57:07.460]  market
[57:07.460 --> 57:08.460]  well
[57:08.460 --> 57:09.460]  at the
[57:09.460 --> 57:10.460]  local level
[57:10.460 --> 57:11.460]  when you go
[57:11.460 --> 57:12.460]  into a
[57:12.460 --> 57:13.460]  dispensary
[57:13.460 --> 57:14.460]  or you look
[57:14.460 --> 57:15.460]  up their
[57:15.460 --> 57:16.460]  menu on
[57:16.460 --> 57:17.460]  weed maps
[57:17.500 --> 57:18.500]  has what
[57:18.500 --> 57:19.500]  they call
[57:19.500 --> 57:20.500]  bottom shelf
[57:20.500 --> 57:21.500]  which is their
[57:21.500 --> 57:22.500]  less expensive
[57:22.500 --> 57:23.500]  strains they don't
[57:23.500 --> 57:24.500]  have much bag
[57:24.500 --> 57:25.500]  appeal but a
[57:25.500 --> 57:26.500]  really skilled
[57:26.500 --> 57:27.500]  buyer knows
[57:27.500 --> 57:28.500]  how to find
[57:28.500 --> 57:29.500]  those things
[57:29.500 --> 57:30.500]  cornerstone had
[57:30.500 --> 57:31.500]  them LAPCG
[57:31.500 --> 57:32.500]  still has
[57:32.500 --> 57:33.500]  them
[57:33.500 --> 57:34.500]  so that's
[57:34.500 --> 57:35.500]  the first
[57:35.500 --> 57:36.500]  thing if they
[57:36.500 --> 57:37.500]  don't have
[57:37.500 --> 57:38.500]  some
[57:38.500 --> 57:39.500]  affordably
[57:39.500 --> 57:40.500]  priced
[57:40.500 --> 57:41.500]  cannabis
[57:41.500 --> 57:42.500]  ask them
[57:42.500 --> 57:43.500]  for that
[57:43.500 --> 57:44.500]  at the
[57:44.500 --> 57:45.500]  state level
[57:45.500 --> 57:46.500]  you have to
[57:46.540 --> 57:47.540]  and this is true
[57:47.540 --> 57:48.540]  at the city
[57:48.540 --> 57:49.540]  level too you
[57:49.540 --> 57:50.540]  have to find
[57:50.540 --> 57:51.540]  your champions
[57:51.540 --> 57:52.540]  people who
[57:52.540 --> 57:53.540]  will commit
[57:53.540 --> 57:54.540]  to
[57:54.540 --> 57:55.540]  being the
[57:55.540 --> 57:56.540]  author
[57:56.540 --> 57:57.540]  with you being
[57:57.540 --> 57:58.540]  the sponsor
[57:58.540 --> 57:59.540]  of a bill
[57:59.540 --> 58:00.540]  that will move
[58:00.540 --> 58:01.540]  things forward
[58:01.540 --> 58:02.540]  I like to try
[58:02.540 --> 58:03.540]  and do things
[58:03.540 --> 58:04.540]  at the local
[58:04.540 --> 58:05.540]  level first
[58:05.540 --> 58:06.540]  because locally
[58:06.540 --> 58:07.540]  I only have
[58:07.540 --> 58:08.540]  to convince
[58:08.540 --> 58:09.540]  eight people
[58:09.540 --> 58:10.540]  to do what I
[58:10.540 --> 58:11.540]  want them to do
[58:11.540 --> 58:12.540]  the California
[58:12.540 --> 58:13.540]  legislature you
[58:13.540 --> 58:14.540]  gotta convince
[58:14.540 --> 58:15.540]  a lot more
[58:15.580 --> 58:16.580]  people to do
[58:16.580 --> 58:17.580]  what you want
[58:17.580 --> 58:18.580]  them to do
[58:18.580 --> 58:19.580]  and a lot
[58:19.580 --> 58:20.580]  of those
[58:20.580 --> 58:21.580]  people aren't
[58:21.580 --> 58:22.580]  too enthusiastic
[58:22.580 --> 58:23.580]  about cannabis
[58:23.580 --> 58:24.580]  to begin with
[58:24.580 --> 58:25.580]  and if you
[58:25.580 --> 58:26.580]  don't watch
[58:26.580 --> 58:27.580]  them closely
[58:27.580 --> 58:28.580]  they can do
[58:28.580 --> 58:29.580]  some very
[58:29.580 --> 58:30.580]  hurtful things
[58:30.580 --> 58:31.580]  while trying
[58:31.580 --> 58:32.580]  to be helpful
[58:32.580 --> 58:33.580]  I would say
[58:33.580 --> 58:34.580]  never ever
[58:34.580 --> 58:35.580]  approach an
[58:35.580 --> 58:36.580]  elected official
[58:36.580 --> 58:37.580]  with your
[58:37.580 --> 58:38.580]  complaint
[58:38.580 --> 58:39.580]  unless you
[58:39.580 --> 58:40.580]  have the
[58:40.580 --> 58:41.580]  solution in
[58:41.580 --> 58:42.580]  your hand
[58:42.580 --> 58:43.580]  and it's
[58:43.580 --> 58:44.580]  gotta be a
[58:44.620 --> 58:45.620]  very good
[58:45.620 --> 58:46.620]  solution
[58:46.620 --> 58:47.620]  and if you
[58:47.620 --> 58:48.620]  look at the
[58:48.620 --> 58:49.620]  legislative calendars
[58:49.620 --> 58:50.620]  you'll see again
[58:50.620 --> 58:51.620]  and again
[58:51.620 --> 58:52.620]  and again
[58:52.620 --> 58:53.620]  Bill Quirk
[58:53.620 --> 58:54.620]  is putting
[58:54.620 --> 58:55.620]  forward bills
[58:55.620 --> 58:56.620]  there's something
[58:56.620 --> 58:57.620]  called the
[58:57.620 --> 58:58.620]  sexy five
[58:58.620 --> 58:59.620]  that Joan Sawyer
[58:59.620 --> 59:00.620]  talks a lot
[59:00.620 --> 59:01.620]  about
[59:01.620 --> 59:02.620]  because those
[59:02.620 --> 59:03.620]  were the
[59:03.620 --> 59:04.620]  legislators
[59:04.620 --> 59:05.620]  who worked
[59:05.620 --> 59:06.620]  on
[59:06.620 --> 59:07.620]  first
[59:07.620 --> 59:08.620]  the medical
[59:08.620 --> 59:09.620]  marijuana
[59:09.620 --> 59:10.620]  legislation
[59:10.620 --> 59:11.620]  and then
[59:11.620 --> 59:12.620]  later on
[59:12.620 --> 59:13.620]  legalization
[59:13.660 --> 59:14.660]  and then
[59:14.660 --> 59:15.660]  they passed
[59:15.660 --> 59:16.660]  a bill
[59:16.660 --> 59:17.660]  that put
[59:17.660 --> 59:18.660]  forward a bill
[59:18.660 --> 59:19.660]  that ASA
[59:19.660 --> 59:20.660]  wrote
[59:20.660 --> 59:21.660]  Don Duncan
[59:21.660 --> 59:22.660]  wrote and
[59:22.660 --> 59:23.660]  got it
[59:23.660 --> 59:24.660]  passed
[59:24.660 --> 59:25.660]  which stops
[59:25.660 --> 59:26.660]  transplant
[59:26.660 --> 59:27.660]  patients from
[59:27.660 --> 59:28.660]  being thrown
[59:28.660 --> 59:29.660]  off
[59:29.660 --> 59:30.660]  transplant
[59:30.660 --> 59:31.660]  lists
[59:31.660 --> 59:32.660]  which is
[59:32.660 --> 59:33.660]  a death
[59:33.660 --> 59:34.660]  sentence
[59:34.660 --> 59:35.660]  and frankly
[59:35.660 --> 59:36.660]  organ failure
[59:36.660 --> 59:37.660]  is just a
[59:37.660 --> 59:38.660]  horrible way
[59:38.660 --> 59:39.660]  to die
[59:39.660 --> 59:40.660]  so look
[59:40.660 --> 59:41.660]  for those
[59:41.660 --> 59:42.660]  guys who
[59:42.700 --> 59:43.700]  it helps
[59:43.700 --> 59:44.700]  if you can
[59:44.700 --> 59:45.700]  write the bill
[59:45.700 --> 59:46.700]  yourself
[59:46.700 --> 59:47.700]  and if you
[59:47.700 --> 59:48.700]  can gather
[59:48.700 --> 59:49.700]  some sort
[59:49.700 --> 59:50.700]  of grassroots
[59:50.700 --> 59:51.700]  support like
[59:51.700 --> 59:52.700]  for instance
[59:52.700 --> 59:53.700]  for patients
[59:53.700 --> 59:54.700]  it would be
[59:54.700 --> 59:55.700]  ASA
[59:55.700 --> 59:56.700]  veterans groups
[59:56.700 --> 59:57.700]  that try and
[59:57.700 --> 59:58.700]  get affordable
[59:58.700 --> 59:59.700]  cannabis or
[59:59.700 --> 01:00:00.700]  free cannabis
[01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:01.700]  to veterans
[01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:02.700]  those kind
[01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:03.700]  of people
[01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:04.700]  they get a lot
[01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:05.700]  of respect
[01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:06.700]  at the
[01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:07.700]  state level
[01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:08.700]  you get a
[01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:09.700]  big labor
[01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:10.700]  union behind
[01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:11.700]  you like
[01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:12.740]  the state
[01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:13.740]  level
[01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:14.740]  and they
[01:00:14.740 --> 01:00:15.740]  really pay
[01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:16.740]  attention
[01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:17.740]  to organizing
[01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:18.740]  my dad
[01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:19.740]  is a
[01:00:19.740 --> 01:00:20.740]  teamster
[01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:21.740]  so
[01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:22.740]  yeah
[01:00:22.740 --> 01:00:23.740]  love the
[01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:24.740]  teamsters
[01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:25.740]  Sarah
[01:00:25.740 --> 01:00:26.740]  could you
[01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:27.740]  could you
[01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:28.740]  explain to us
[01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:29.740]  exactly what
[01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:30.740]  SB34
[01:00:30.740 --> 01:00:31.740]  does
[01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:32.740]  what it
[01:00:32.740 --> 01:00:33.740]  allows
[01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:34.740]  dispensaries
[01:00:34.740 --> 01:00:35.740]  to do
[01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:36.740]  in detail
[01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:37.740]  that was
[01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:38.740]  required a
[01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:39.740]  lot of
[01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:40.740]  legislation
[01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:41.780]  has
[01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:42.780]  they
[01:00:42.780 --> 01:00:43.780]  didn't
[01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:44.780]  figure in
[01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:45.780]  the big
[01:00:45.780 --> 01:00:46.780]  thing that was
[01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:47.780]  stopping compassion
[01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:48.780]  which was
[01:00:48.780 --> 01:00:49.780]  the taxes
[01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:50.780]  right
[01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:51.780]  you start
[01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:52.780]  with cultivation
[01:00:52.780 --> 01:00:53.780]  I think it's
[01:00:53.780 --> 01:00:54.780]  nine
[01:00:54.780 --> 01:00:55.780]  dollars and
[01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:56.780]  sixty cents
[01:00:56.780 --> 01:00:57.780]  and an ounce
[01:00:57.780 --> 01:00:58.780]  or sixty five
[01:00:58.780 --> 01:00:59.780]  cents an ounce
[01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:00.780]  some ridiculous
[01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:01.780]  amount
[01:01:01.780 --> 01:01:02.780]  and then
[01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:03.780]  you've got
[01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:04.780]  your excise
[01:01:04.780 --> 01:01:05.780]  tax your
[01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:06.780]  sales tax
[01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:07.780]  your local
[01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:08.780]  taxes
[01:01:08.780 --> 01:01:09.780]  that all
[01:01:09.780 --> 01:01:18.200]  as that existed, it was just too expensive to try and get free cannabis to people who
[01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:19.680]  really needed it.
[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:26.920]  So first they had one piece of legislation that sort of allowed compassion programs and
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:34.040]  then they came back and I believe it was SB 34 that got rid of the taxes.
[01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:45.900]  I know it seems weird that that was the big sort of stone in the road for compassion but
[01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:46.900]  it really was.
[01:01:46.900 --> 01:01:53.700]  Some of the most heartbreaking testimonies I ever heard a public comment was people who
[01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:59.100]  had been running these big compassion programs for veterans and other people who just couldn't
[01:01:59.100 --> 01:02:02.180]  do it anymore because of taxes.
[01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:05.740]  I'm telling you, it brought tears to my eyes and I don't cry easy.
[01:02:05.740 --> 01:02:11.060]  So I'm really excited that the taxes have gone away.
[01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:17.860]  Michael, you're known for crying fairly frequently.
[01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:24.220]  Can you just give us a quick timeline of, you know, we talked the other day and you
[01:02:24.220 --> 01:02:29.900]  gave me like, you know, the first shops in the Bay Area and then the first ones in LA
[01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:35.420]  and then can you and Sarah give kind of, I assume politicians weren't always cannabis
[01:02:35.420 --> 01:02:41.900]  friendly, so can you give some of the salacious stories of dealing with the political bureaucracy
[01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:44.900]  in LA and Eagle Rock and...
[01:02:44.900 --> 01:02:47.620]  I mean, I got a few of those.
[01:02:47.620 --> 01:02:48.620]  Let's see.
[01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:54.940]  So the best one was the first time I had two council members come to Cornerstone.
[01:02:54.940 --> 01:02:58.780]  Neither of them had ever stepped foot in a dispensary.
[01:02:58.780 --> 01:03:01.180]  It was...
[01:03:01.180 --> 01:03:02.180]  And what year was this?
[01:03:02.180 --> 01:03:09.180]  Oh, this would have been 2000, late 2008, maybe.
[01:03:09.180 --> 01:03:10.180]  Okay.
[01:03:10.180 --> 01:03:17.820]  It was Dennis Zine, who was the former cop that Sarah spoke about, who became a champion
[01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:23.060]  of medical cannabis access in California, in LA.
[01:03:23.060 --> 01:03:32.780]  And Jose Huizar, who was my council member in the district that my dispensary was in.
[01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:35.900]  Was he also a champion of medical cannabis?
[01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:41.100]  He's a champ, but man, it's hard to talk about Jose.
[01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:49.100]  He's got quite a few nicknames around City Hall and he has an active FBI investigation
[01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:50.300]  right now.
[01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:51.460]  But he did tell me a funny story.
[01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:56.380]  I went to his office on Colorado Boulevard in Eagle Rock and he told me about how he
[01:03:56.380 --> 01:04:00.260]  used to grow pot in his dad's front yard.
[01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:04.140]  And so he really likes to ingratiate himself.
[01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:11.220]  But what was great about having them come to my shop was Cornerstone was really designed
[01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:14.140]  to look like a dentist's office.
[01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:17.860]  I mean, really sterile.
[01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:24.700]  And our waiting room just looked like you were kind of in a reasonably tasteful dentist's
[01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:25.700]  office.
[01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:35.500]  So much so that we had an OG Kush grower driving down the street in his new sports car and
[01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:41.660]  run, he wasn't on our way to us, but he's just blasting down the road.
[01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:50.860]  And he nicked a SUV trying to make a left turn and they plowed through the window of
[01:04:50.860 --> 01:04:53.000]  our sales room.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:59.540]  And we were so low key that when Fox News showed up to cover it, they said we were a
[01:04:59.540 --> 01:05:00.540]  dentist's office.
[01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:03.900]  They didn't know we were a dispensary.
[01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:12.540]  So in those days, the whole game was to try to be as discreet as possible because you
[01:05:12.540 --> 01:05:17.500]  really wanted to try to avoid notice of the DEA or LAPD.
[01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:20.380]  So no Green Cross?
[01:05:20.380 --> 01:05:21.380]  Yeah.
[01:05:21.380 --> 01:05:28.100]  And so, yeah, it was, those were really interesting times.
[01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:36.940]  And so it was really, I mean, I think there were several council members who were very,
[01:05:36.940 --> 01:05:39.700]  very genuine in their support.
[01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:45.340]  Dennis Zine being one of them, Paul Koretz being one of them.
[01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:46.340]  And they were great.
[01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:51.700]  And then there were other people on the LA City Council who were opponents and really
[01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:53.020]  tried to fight against it.
[01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:58.060]  And Wezar actually started out being kind of a supporter and then ended up being kind
[01:05:58.060 --> 01:06:04.500]  of an opponent and, you know, just flipping and flopping away.
[01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:06.980]  And so, yeah, it's always been interesting.
[01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:13.540]  Dealing with politicians, I mean, Sarah's much more experienced than I am, but it hasn't
[01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:15.540]  made me love them anymore.
[01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:25.420]  It is a source of great satisfaction to me that Englander, who has already pleaded guilty,
[01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:33.340]  and Wezar, who is on his way to pleading guilty, were historically two of the biggest opponents
[01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:37.140]  to safe access in Los Angeles.
[01:06:37.140 --> 01:06:41.580]  And now they're exposed as people who have done some very bad things, far worse than
[01:06:41.620 --> 01:06:47.900]  anything I've known a pre-ICO to ever do in Los Angeles.
[01:06:47.900 --> 01:06:51.180]  So you have to pick your battles.
[01:06:51.180 --> 01:06:53.740]  You have to get along with everyone.
[01:06:53.740 --> 01:06:57.860]  But there are people who have another agenda.
[01:06:57.860 --> 01:07:05.060]  And all across the state, you've seen whistleblowing going on with local politicians who are demanding
[01:07:05.060 --> 01:07:08.300]  bribes, doing different things.
[01:07:08.340 --> 01:07:14.660]  And most often, the reason the FBI gets involved is a guy who's trying to get a license goes
[01:07:14.660 --> 01:07:19.420]  and says, you know, I've been approached about this and this isn't right.
[01:07:19.420 --> 01:07:22.580]  This isn't the way it's supposed to go.
[01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:30.620]  So I believe that the cannabis industry has a lot of problems to overcome.
[01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:39.860]  But I think people who want to be licensed, who want to follow the rules, should not be
[01:07:39.860 --> 01:07:43.900]  treated any differently than any other business.
[01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:46.860]  And that is one of the big sticking points.
[01:07:46.860 --> 01:07:51.820]  Because it's marijuana, the rules are always going to be a little different for you than
[01:07:51.820 --> 01:07:54.580]  everybody else who runs a business.
[01:07:55.540 --> 01:08:02.100]  I'm hopeful that as the years go by, a cannabis dispensary will be treated just like any other
[01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:04.020]  retail operation.
[01:08:04.020 --> 01:08:07.140]  And everything else.
[01:08:07.140 --> 01:08:09.700]  I think the sticking point there is trust.
[01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:14.940]  I mean, the thing is, is that, you know, there's a reason that people want to sniff the jar
[01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:21.780]  when they come into shops, is they don't trust what's being sold.
[01:08:21.780 --> 01:08:27.420]  They're often sold things by people who don't know what they're selling.
[01:08:27.420 --> 01:08:35.940]  And so every, I mean, I think that as the cannabis industry earns trust, I think a lot
[01:08:35.940 --> 01:08:38.020]  of things are going to be relaxed.
[01:08:38.020 --> 01:08:39.780]  But we're still not there yet.
[01:08:39.780 --> 01:08:47.220]  I mean, in the case of cannabis, to some degree, we're, you know, we're still, a lot of us
[01:08:47.220 --> 01:08:52.100]  still act like moonshiners, all right, who are trying to go legit.
[01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:57.740]  And you know, I mean, you see these famous cultivators around, you know, California,
[01:08:57.740 --> 01:09:01.260]  who used to be gangsters.
[01:09:01.260 --> 01:09:05.900]  And the truth is, is just because they've got a fancy shop on Melrose doesn't mean they're
[01:09:05.900 --> 01:09:08.340]  still not gangsters.
[01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:11.620]  So I think there's some reasons to be concerned.
[01:09:11.620 --> 01:09:14.060]  I mean, I think we still have to clean up our act a little bit.
[01:09:14.060 --> 01:09:18.980]  Well, yeah, and I think at least the guy that, you know, one of the main dispensers
[01:09:18.980 --> 01:09:25.780]  I used to go to before, you know, COVID happened, I don't think they figured out delivery yet
[01:09:25.780 --> 01:09:26.780]  for whatever reason.
[01:09:26.780 --> 01:09:30.900]  But you can see that they're enjoying that lifestyle too.
[01:09:30.900 --> 01:09:36.620]  And it's like, you can see from the cars they drive and it's like, okay, well, why are you
[01:09:36.620 --> 01:09:37.620]  about this?
[01:09:37.620 --> 01:09:38.620]  You know?
[01:09:38.620 --> 01:09:39.620]  Yeah.
[01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:48.780]  I mean, again, it's, you know, moonshiners used to sell out of the back of trucks.
[01:09:48.780 --> 01:09:52.100]  In the old days, everybody sold out from the farm gate.
[01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:54.940]  And I think that we still have to get used to the changes.
[01:09:54.940 --> 01:09:59.420]  It doesn't mean we should cut out the people who traditionally were involved in this business,
[01:09:59.420 --> 01:10:01.980]  but we should hold everybody to a higher standard.
[01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:07.700]  So just quickly, Michael, I mean, we talked about kind of, you know, 20 years ago, it
[01:10:07.780 --> 01:10:13.860]  was people whose hearts were in it, who were opening these shops.
[01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:16.860]  And there's kind of been a change in regards to people who are maybe a little more about
[01:10:16.860 --> 01:10:17.860]  money.
[01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:23.900]  Can you give some love to some of the people who were around when you ran Cornerstone,
[01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:29.980]  who you thought were kind of truly champions of providing medicine to patients?
[01:10:29.980 --> 01:10:33.260]  Well, I mean, you know, we already mentioned Wham!
[01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:37.540]  So you know, Mike and Valerie Corral were kind of the gold standard.
[01:10:38.380 --> 01:10:41.940]  I mean, I used to say that, you know, Valerie Corral was the mother Teresa of cannabis.
[01:10:41.940 --> 01:10:46.940]  Any room she walked into, she tried to make every single person in the room feel comfortable
[01:10:46.940 --> 01:10:49.740]  and do anything she could to make sure their needs were met.
[01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:54.540]  I mean, she was really, she is really extraordinary.
[01:10:54.540 --> 01:10:59.740]  Mike Corral was just a brilliant cultivator who just really paid attention to what kinds
[01:10:59.740 --> 01:11:04.620]  of cannabis might meet people's medicinal needs.
[01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:09.980]  And, you know, he's a real handful, but I gotta give a shout out to Steve D'Angelo,
[01:11:09.980 --> 01:11:17.340]  because the truth is, is that he's, I mean, the truth is, he really did take a lot of
[01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:18.340]  arrows for people.
[01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:22.300]  I had a meeting with George Lucas one time, and you know, Lucas said, first one up the
[01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:24.500]  hill catches all the arrows.
[01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:26.620]  And man, D'Angelo took a lot of arrows.
[01:11:26.620 --> 01:11:33.180]  I mean, he's a colorful guy with a colorful past, but we wouldn't have lab testing in
[01:11:33.180 --> 01:11:35.500]  California without him.
[01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:40.580]  I mean, he really, and that's a huge, huge thing because patients have to know what's
[01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:41.580]  in their medicine.
[01:11:41.580 --> 01:11:51.740]  I mean, you know, ASAP, I mean, ASAP really carried the water for this whole concept of
[01:11:51.740 --> 01:11:53.460]  access.
[01:11:53.460 --> 01:12:01.060]  And they were really effective because the combination of Steph Scherer and Don Duncan,
[01:12:01.860 --> 01:12:06.020]  and Sarah Armstrong, they're just relentless.
[01:12:06.020 --> 01:12:12.940]  And Yami Bolanos here in town with GLACA, also just relentless.
[01:12:12.940 --> 01:12:14.060]  And that's what it takes.
[01:12:14.060 --> 01:12:19.340]  It just takes people who are not going to take no for an answer, who know that they're
[01:12:19.340 --> 01:12:21.980]  on the right side of history.
[01:12:21.980 --> 01:12:27.540]  And then there are all kinds of people in the Emerald Triangle who were looking for
[01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:32.740]  cannabis varieties that had things like CBD.
[01:12:32.740 --> 01:12:39.140]  And still, you know, when the DEA showed up, the DEA didn't care that it had CBD in it.
[01:12:39.140 --> 01:12:42.140]  And so they were taking great personal risks.
[01:12:42.140 --> 01:12:46.300]  And also we're growing a plant that wasn't commercially viable.
[01:12:46.300 --> 01:12:49.540]  Most people had no idea what CBD was, so they wouldn't pay for it.
[01:12:49.540 --> 01:12:52.140]  So it was really from the heart.
[01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:57.820]  So I think the pioneers, I mean, you really got to read Martin Lee's book.
[01:12:57.820 --> 01:13:01.660]  Oh, and Martin Lee and Fred Garner for Project CBD.
[01:13:01.660 --> 01:13:06.780]  And Martin Lee had written a book called Smoke Signals, which is the social history of cannabis
[01:13:06.780 --> 01:13:07.780]  in the United States.
[01:13:07.780 --> 01:13:13.140]  And really worth reading because it really tells the story of a lot of these early fights,
[01:13:13.140 --> 01:13:21.460]  like with Todd Macaria, who was this doctor who like just before anybody was like talking
[01:13:21.460 --> 01:13:25.700]  about the medicinal uses of cannabis for dozens of conditions.
[01:13:25.700 --> 01:13:29.340]  And he's been proved right.
[01:13:29.340 --> 01:13:32.260]  And so yeah.
[01:13:32.260 --> 01:13:33.260]  So yeah, a project.
[01:13:33.260 --> 01:13:39.100]  Oh, and then so Fred Garner also started O'Shaughnessy's, which was this amazing newspaper that collected
[01:13:39.100 --> 01:13:43.700]  all the latest scientific data about the medicinal uses of cannabis.
[01:13:43.700 --> 01:13:51.400]  And he interviewed Ethan Russo and Rafi Mashulam and all these pioneering cannabis scientists.
[01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:57.800]  And O'Shaughnessy's to this day is still has been a fantastic resource for people trying
[01:13:57.800 --> 01:13:59.680]  to use cannabis as a medicine.
[01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:02.480]  So that's just my two cents.
[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:05.040]  I wish I had taken notes.
[01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:07.320]  Try to remember everything.
[01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:11.240]  You can always get in touch with me, Alice, anytime you want.
[01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:13.280]  You can watch the video again later.
[01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:14.280]  Yeah.
[01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:15.280]  Okay, sweet.
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:21.040]  But also just friend me wherever and ask me any questions you want, anytime.
[01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:23.160]  I'm going to interview you for my site.
[01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:24.160]  It's going to happen.
[01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:25.160]  No problem.
[01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:31.520]  So I got a question while we have Michael.
[01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:36.920]  I'm looking at an article now that was posted today on Fresh Toast.
[01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:40.080]  Can marijuana terpenes treat COVID?
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:41.840]  These scientists believe so.
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:44.800]  They're referencing the Israeli research.
[01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:47.200]  There's two or three different studies.
[01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:48.200]  Yes.
[01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:49.200]  This is Judy Byrey.
[01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:50.200]  Yeah.
[01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:51.360]  She's a professor in Israel.
[01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:55.960]  And Judy Byrey has been, he was holding his results really close to his chest for a long
[01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:58.280]  time because I think he was trying to raise venture capital.
[01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:02.280]  So he'd done tests on cannabis compounds and cancer lines.
[01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:03.880]  And these are cell studies typically.
[01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:09.000]  So what happens is they'll take a pure compound, a pure terpene, a pure cannabinoid, yada yada,
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:15.080]  and they'll put it on a culture plate of a cancer cell or another kind of cell and then
[01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:18.200]  watch to see how it interacts.
[01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:19.200]  Okay.
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:24.520]  So there's all these assays out there that allow you to do testing on a cell level.
[01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:27.640]  Now, that's called in vitro testing.
[01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:28.640]  Okay.
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:30.600]  And it's of limited use.
[01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:36.520]  So what it may be is they're watching how these pure compounds interact with this particular
[01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:42.040]  type of coronavirus and whether or not it can make a difference.
[01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:44.160]  Is it likely it can?
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:45.160]  Yes.
[01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:46.160]  Is it?
[01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:51.640]  Is it unlikely it is at the dose that people are normally exposed to or can tolerate?
[01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:53.080]  That's another question.
[01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:56.200]  And there are bigger concerns about cannabis and COVID right now.
[01:15:56.200 --> 01:16:00.720]  The biggest concern comes out of a unrelated study from University of Arizona.
[01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:03.400]  It was published a couple of weeks ago.
[01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:10.560]  And what they looked at is they looked at blood clotting in trauma victims whose blood
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:13.000]  tested positive for THC.
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:16.400]  And they were finding increased blood clotting.
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:25.160]  That's a real problem with COVID because COVID appears to derange blood clotting in younger
[01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:30.200]  patients infected with COVID and can lead to strokes and heart attacks and all kinds
[01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:31.240]  of stuff.
[01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:36.640]  So the question is, how does THC play in the COVID world?
[01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:40.240]  And the initial evidence is a little concerning.
[01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:46.000]  So what I've been telling people is regardless of the terpene, regardless of the cannabinoid
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:52.200]  you use, take the minimum effective dose.
[01:16:52.200 --> 01:17:00.640]  This is not a time to try to beat your personal dabbing record because it could have really,
[01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:02.840]  really bad outcomes.
[01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:06.440]  And obviously, I mean, in the case of the trauma thing, I mean, that's a bit of a stretch
[01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:13.200]  to say, oh, COVID clotting, trauma clotting, but it's the same cascade within the body.
[01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:15.640]  So we have to pay attention to it.
[01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:21.120]  Are there forms of ingestion that you feel are probably safer than others at this time?
[01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:28.120]  Yeah, well, right now, so there's also a study that was discussed last week on the American
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:37.880]  Chemical Society CAN meeting about breakdown products from terpenes in vaporizers, E-pens.
[01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:40.640]  And the results are ugly.
[01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:45.160]  The higher the temperature, the higher the voltage on the pen, the more these breakdown
[01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:47.520]  products are created.
[01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:52.520]  And two of the breakdown products are the principal dangerous components in most air
[01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:54.840]  pollution.
[01:17:54.840 --> 01:17:59.200]  Because there are a lot of terpenes in nature, and when they break down in certain conditions,
[01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:03.520]  they can interact with things and form ozone and all kinds of nasty things.
[01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:13.240]  But the takeaway is that you want to use the lowest temperature ingestion system if you're
[01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:16.560]  going to inhale.
[01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:20.280]  And some people just get better effects from inhalation because it's a different pathway
[01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:23.080]  effectively, different metabolic pathway.
[01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:32.760]  And so my advice is move towards flour vaporizers whenever possible or low temperature vaporizers
[01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:34.600]  if you're using electronic vaporizers.
[01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:39.000]  Use the lowest vaporization setting, which is typically 3.2 volts.
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:42.360]  And don't crank the temperature.
[01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:48.320]  And the problem with vaping is vaping is effectively like smoking in ultra slow motion.
[01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:50.840]  So you get the terps off first and then the cannabinoids.
[01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:55.360]  Most people don't like vaporizers because it feels different.
[01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:57.280]  They're just not being patient enough.
[01:18:57.280 --> 01:19:01.000]  If you're patient with the vaporizer, you will get exactly the same effect you get from
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:02.000]  smoking.
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.280]  It's just going to be spread out a little bit more.
[01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:06.160]  And people need to understand that.
[01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:10.520]  Just to clarify, are you talking like a dryer vaporizer or like a vape pen?
[01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:16.280]  Yeah, so my favorite, my favorites, I've got them nearby because I use them.
[01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:21.160]  My favorites are the Mighty from Storrs and Bickel, like right here.
[01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:22.640]  And the latest Fireflow.
[01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:28.200]  It depends on what you want to use because, you know, this is confection.
[01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:30.680]  I really, really like the Mighty.
[01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:32.360]  It's just because it's got the temperature on it.
[01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:34.360]  So I can set it to 392.
[01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:38.560]  Yeah, I saw that one for the first time, Tom.
[01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:44.560]  Remember when all the hashmakers stopped by and one of them pulled that out.
[01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:49.080]  This one's actually in my car, so I don't have it with me, but I've been playing with
[01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:50.080]  that one.
[01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:52.160]  I've been getting back into dryer vaporizing.
[01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:53.160]  They're fantastic.
[01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:55.360]  And if you get high terp cannabis, they're really great.
[01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:57.320]  Excuse me, I've got a lab call.
[01:19:57.320 --> 01:19:58.320]  Question for you.
[01:19:58.320 --> 01:19:59.320]  Question for you then.
[01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:00.320]  This is Michael.
[01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:04.520]  Oh, he has to take a call.
[01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:06.160]  I just muted him.
[01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:07.160]  Okay.
[01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:14.200]  Yeah, no, so basically is what he's saying that too much THC is not good at this point?
[01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:19.480]  What you have to do is you have to control your THC dose if you've been exposed to COVID
[01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:22.960]  because we don't know if it could potentially...
[01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:30.840]  If you start to develop clotting issues related to COVID infection, THC may exacerbate those.
[01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:33.040]  And we're not going to know because there's not going to be studies done for a little
[01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:34.040]  while.
[01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:36.120]  Remember, we're just dealing with COVID right now.
[01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:40.200]  But soon what will happen is epidemiologists will look at the blood samples of COVID patients
[01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:42.760]  that come in and they'll screen them for cannabinoids.
[01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:46.880]  And then they'll start to look for patterns to say, oh, people who had high amounts of
[01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:49.120]  THC metabolites had worse outcomes.
[01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:52.640]  We don't know that yet, but don't be surprised.
[01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:53.800]  So I have a question.
[01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:58.480]  So you're launching some new products now in the middle of all this.
[01:20:58.480 --> 01:21:02.440]  How do you do that taking into account everything that you've just said?
[01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:05.480]  Well, I basically designed vaporizable products.
[01:21:05.480 --> 01:21:11.640]  I mean, we're a flower product where what I've done is I've stabilized the terpene fraction.
[01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:12.960]  And so, yeah.
[01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:15.320]  And the way I use the products is in a flower vape.
[01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:16.440]  I mean, I just love them.
[01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:21.040]  So, you know, all I was trying to do with my new company was literally invent a product
[01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:22.040]  that I liked.
[01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:26.480]  Do you have a jar of it on the table in front of you?
[01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:29.040]  Can we get a visual?
[01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:30.040]  There we go.
[01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:31.040]  There we go.
[01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:35.360]  Do you want to pull some flower out?
[01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:40.280]  I emptied this one already.
[01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:41.280]  What can I say?
[01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:43.920]  I use my own product.
[01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:44.920]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:45.920]  I'm fresh out.
[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:51.200]  So where and when can those be found?
[01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:53.120]  Oh, we're launching this week.
[01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:55.960]  So you go to perfect-blends.com.
[01:21:55.960 --> 01:22:00.320]  Oh my God, look who's back.
[01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:04.240]  Anyway, I've got to go down.
[01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:06.000]  I've got to go down.
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:07.000]  I'll be back in a minute.
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:08.000]  I have to drop some samples.
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:11.000]  I got to get the seeds in front of my house.
[01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:14.720]  All right, see you.
[01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:20.480]  So, John, I think this could be for you and Sarah.
[01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:27.000]  Sarah, we had talked about kind of barriers to safe access and we talked about economic
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:33.360]  and then obviously local control, which means that there are deserts, the no compassion
[01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:37.600]  programs or samples, which is now kind of hopefully changing.
[01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:41.800]  It went way in one direction of nothing and now it's hopefully coming back.
[01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:52.960]  But can you talk about barriers to safe access going forward?
[01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:59.040]  In order to be truly accessible, it's got to become a lot cheaper.
[01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:05.280]  And that's a very complex discussion.
[01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:14.600]  The other thing that I'd like to see is the last time I saw Gene talk, he talked about
[01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:22.240]  and this was several years ago, he talked about how there'd been no trials on humans
[01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:26.840]  for how cannabis might help with cancer.
[01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:31.920]  And I think getting the research done, people like Michael Backus and everything, it will
[01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:39.480]  lead you to a more cost effective and viable product.
[01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:42.600]  But we can't stop with the research either.
[01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:47.840]  There have been thousands of studies done and it just amazes me that we still have a
[01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:49.360]  way to go.
[01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:58.680]  The third problem is that from a political point of view, many, many, many legislators
[01:23:58.760 --> 01:24:06.960]  at all levels, federal, state, local, are still convinced that cannabis is not medicine.
[01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:14.280]  And even though their electorate has frequently voted to have safe access, they find a number
[01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:20.280]  of ways to impede that progress.
[01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:26.960]  So you've got your economics, you need more research, and you need to really get in the
[01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:37.880]  face of legislators and talk to them in such a way that they can no longer stall on bringing
[01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:45.600]  safe access to every community that voted first in 1996 for medical and then again for
[01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:48.480]  adult use.
[01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:55.480]  So I'll let Gene tell you the rest of it because I know he's got some thoughts.
[01:24:55.480 --> 01:24:59.280]  Too many thoughts, thanks, Sarah.
[01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:07.440]  And I've got a question for you.
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:17.040]  Well my question is, and I already know the answer, but the Compassionate Use Act, Prop
[01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:23.200]  215, still is in effect as far as I know.
[01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:26.440]  And maybe you can comment on that.
[01:25:26.440 --> 01:25:32.360]  And that's because the patients, to me, are the ultimate warriors.
[01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:40.680]  And outside of the patients are folks like Dennis Perrone and Todd Micaria who created
[01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:48.400]  this act with the intention of compassion for the patient's plight.
[01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:53.960]  And in that act, they allowed folks to get access to their own medicine.
[01:25:53.960 --> 01:26:00.680]  And I had to step away just now to talk to a patient who reminded me, you know, she's
[01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:03.600]  able to grow her own medicine.
[01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:10.720]  Unfortunately she gets this reaction from certain types, some in Cush varietals she
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:17.000]  calls, quote unquote, where she gets an infection or an inflammation in her sinuses, but she
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:18.920]  needs the medicine.
[01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:24.680]  And so she's got to figure out which medicines will not give her the negative effect and
[01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:25.680]  which will.
[01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:31.920]  And she's able to do that because she lives in the Santa Cruz mountains and around her
[01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:37.320]  are many people who grow and she feels confident in their source.
[01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:40.080]  And so she's in the lucky position.
[01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:47.400]  Many patients, especially in the LA area, are relying on labeling and don't live next
[01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:55.080]  to a cultivator that can reliably give them medicine.
[01:26:55.080 --> 01:27:01.440]  But what I'm excited about is, and what I believe is that the Compassionate Use Act
[01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:04.000]  still is in effect.
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:09.880]  Maybe you can help me with that.
[01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:17.600]  The biggest problem is that, yes, it is and you can get a medical license, but patients
[01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:25.200]  over the years have suffered from such invasive discrimination that when legalization hit,
[01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:28.320]  they stopped renewing their recs.
[01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:33.360]  And I've got to tell you, of all the things that patients do, that makes me the most nervous
[01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:40.200]  Because frequently the only person you're going to talk to who can really tell you what's
[01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:48.280]  what, if you're very sick, you may be taking 10 different kinds of pharmaceuticals, you
[01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:49.920]  need a doctor.
[01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:52.640]  You need to work with a doctor.
[01:27:52.640 --> 01:28:02.640]  And when patients stopped renewing their recs, there was a very firm network across the state.
[01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:07.080]  One of Gene's doctors and his network actually saved my life at one point.
[01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:13.200]  So these were dedicated doctors who really knew their stuff and all of a sudden patients
[01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:14.400]  aren't renewing their recs.
[01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:21.200]  So they're not getting that input from a medical doctor anymore.
[01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:27.440]  Patients make up, from what dispensary operators tell me, between 70 and 85 percent of their
[01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:29.560]  clientele still.
[01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:32.200]  They're just not renewing their recs.
[01:28:32.280 --> 01:28:40.560]  And on top of it, back in the day before legalization passed, if you wanted to work in a dispenser,
[01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:42.400]  you had to have a rec.
[01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:48.600]  So the workforce is still very much patients.
[01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:57.840]  And from my point of view, once you stop having experts in the mix and it's just people trying
[01:28:57.880 --> 01:29:04.600]  to sell you products, you can get into some very dangerous spaces.
[01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:12.000]  I still renew my rec every year and I still get my county card through the state program
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:17.560]  because I want to be able to sit down and talk to a doctor and ask the kind of questions
[01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:20.840]  that no bud tender is ever going to be able to answer.
[01:29:20.840 --> 01:29:28.240]  So that's one way that compassionate use has kind of gone south and it's a very dangerous
[01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:29.720]  development.
[01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:39.480]  The other problem with this is that patients are no longer identifiable as a discrete group.
[01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:43.680]  They are now lumped in with recreational users.
[01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:46.680]  I personally feel that all use is medical.
[01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:48.680]  I think Perone was right.
[01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:53.880]  I've never had a lengthy conversation with a recreational user who didn't quickly own
[01:29:53.880 --> 01:30:00.520]  up to the fact that marijuana was wonderful because it took care of things like sleeplessness
[01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:03.040]  or anxiety or pain.
[01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:04.040]  Those are medical uses.
[01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:08.600]  Those are not, that is not have a glass of wine and relax time.
[01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:12.480]  That is treating some pretty core problems.
[01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:15.080]  So compassionate use still exists.
[01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:20.960]  At the state level I think you check one box for medical and one box for recreational.
[01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:27.320]  I would advise everybody to always get a medical license if you're going to operate a dispensary
[01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:31.520]  because ASA got the CGS amendment in 2014.
[01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:34.080]  It's been renewed every year.
[01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:40.680]  That means that the federal government cannot raid you or bother you if you're obeying the
[01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:42.560]  laws of your home state.
[01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:49.120]  So that, more than any other development, that ending of the raids, the federal raids,
[01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:54.840]  helped the industry in Los Angeles and all across the state.
[01:30:54.840 --> 01:30:58.080]  Compassionate use is widely misunderstood these days.
[01:30:58.080 --> 01:31:04.720]  It's almost become like this thing your grandparents did back in the day.
[01:31:04.720 --> 01:31:11.280]  But I believe it's very much alive and that we have a long way to go before patients have
[01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:12.280]  true access.
[01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:18.440]  And I just hope that I'm well enough to continue to fight until I can't anymore and that when
[01:31:18.440 --> 01:31:26.760]  I lay down my burden that I can look out on a landscape where I will never be denied safe
[01:31:26.760 --> 01:31:27.760]  access again.
[01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:30.760]  So that's all I got.
[01:31:30.760 --> 01:31:33.760]  I like it.
[01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:36.760]  Great answer, Sarah.
[01:31:36.760 --> 01:31:41.030]  There's a dog cameo.
[01:31:41.510 --> 01:31:43.510]  Yes, this is Kyla Kuch.
[01:31:43.510 --> 01:31:52.030]  I posted a message to all of you about the University of Arizona study that led to my
[01:31:52.030 --> 01:31:57.030]  concern about COVID in certain patients and THC.
[01:31:57.030 --> 01:32:01.030]  So yeah, you should check it out.
[01:32:01.030 --> 01:32:03.030]  It's a really good study.
[01:32:03.030 --> 01:32:05.030]  These people know what they're doing.
[01:32:05.030 --> 01:32:11.030]  Another reason I really love having doctors in charge of this is, and people like Michael
[01:32:11.030 --> 01:32:17.030]  Bacchus too, is there's this, I don't know what to call it.
[01:32:17.030 --> 01:32:22.030]  It's like a fantasy that marijuana is the end all be all.
[01:32:22.030 --> 01:32:23.030]  It'll cure everything.
[01:32:23.030 --> 01:32:25.030]  It'll take care of everything.
[01:32:25.030 --> 01:32:29.030]  And my experience has been quite often it does.
[01:32:29.030 --> 01:32:33.030]  But when it doesn't, it can really have some bad effects.
[01:32:34.030 --> 01:32:42.030]  So having educated people talking in a science-based language about this can only be good, even
[01:32:42.030 --> 01:32:47.030]  if it means sometimes you have to say, there may be a problem here.
[01:32:47.030 --> 01:32:49.030]  That's all I got.
[01:32:49.030 --> 01:32:52.030]  Yeah, I mean, I think, I mean, and that's why it's got to be doctors.
[01:32:52.030 --> 01:32:54.030]  It's not never going to be me.
[01:32:54.030 --> 01:32:57.030]  All I do is point at doctors and translate for patients.
[01:32:57.030 --> 01:32:58.030]  All right.
[01:32:58.030 --> 01:33:04.030]  So typically most people who get a medical recommendation, in my opinion, don't have
[01:33:04.030 --> 01:33:06.030]  enough interaction with their doctor.
[01:33:06.030 --> 01:33:10.030]  It's not necessarily because the doctor doesn't want it, but it's just the patient doesn't
[01:33:10.030 --> 01:33:12.030]  take advantage of the access.
[01:33:12.030 --> 01:33:21.030]  And so I like to point at doctors and say, ask them because they're doctors.
[01:33:21.030 --> 01:33:22.030]  I agree with being a doctor.
[01:33:23.030 --> 01:33:28.030]  I agree with you guys, but I do have to say, you know, I get my information from patients
[01:33:28.030 --> 01:33:32.030]  a lot and it's a community.
[01:33:32.030 --> 01:33:33.030]  Very much so.
[01:33:33.030 --> 01:33:38.030]  I appreciate everyone for contributing to the community.
[01:33:38.030 --> 01:33:43.030]  And we're going to figure out how this is going to help more people as we go.
[01:33:43.030 --> 01:33:50.030]  So just quickly on a fun note, the inspiration for pulling this whole conversation together
[01:33:51.030 --> 01:34:00.030]  was a coronavirus beginning of lockdown story that crossed my radar, which was Alice.
[01:34:00.030 --> 01:34:05.030]  So Alice, can you talk, I guess the shop you normally went to wasn't delivering.
[01:34:05.030 --> 01:34:08.030]  So can you tell the story and give everyone the backstory?
[01:34:08.030 --> 01:34:09.030]  Yeah.
[01:34:09.030 --> 01:34:11.030]  Pure Life is a great shop.
[01:34:11.030 --> 01:34:16.030]  And I know Sarah had talked about, you know, you find a good dispensary when they have
[01:34:17.030 --> 01:34:23.030]  a lower level, you know, it's not lower level, it's still high quality, but they sell it
[01:34:23.030 --> 01:34:27.030]  for maybe 20 bucks an eighth or possibly less.
[01:34:27.030 --> 01:34:30.030]  But they just weren't working out the whole delivery service.
[01:34:30.030 --> 01:34:37.030]  And, you know, for my wife and I, you know, cannabis is ultimately, I mean, I'm on, like
[01:34:37.030 --> 01:34:42.030]  Sarah said, I'm on six to seven different medications.
[01:34:43.030 --> 01:34:45.030]  But I'm not on any pain medications.
[01:34:45.030 --> 01:34:48.030]  And that's largely due to cannabis.
[01:34:48.030 --> 01:34:54.030]  As far as my wife, there's no medications for the multitude of symptoms that she, that
[01:34:54.030 --> 01:34:57.030]  she goes through every day.
[01:34:57.030 --> 01:34:59.030]  Cannabis is it, basically.
[01:34:59.030 --> 01:35:06.030]  And yeah, so our main dispensary that we go to, which is not 10 minutes away from my house,
[01:35:07.030 --> 01:35:10.030]  you know, wasn't doing the delivery services.
[01:35:10.030 --> 01:35:15.030]  And I, one of my favorite brands that they were selling was this brand called Cali Hash.
[01:35:15.030 --> 01:35:18.030]  And they do cold water extraction.
[01:35:18.030 --> 01:35:24.030]  So another, another source that, you know, is pure and doesn't have any, you know, they
[01:35:24.030 --> 01:35:28.030]  know what they're doing.
[01:35:28.030 --> 01:35:33.030]  I sort of reached out to him, you know, through my network Rolling Stone, which I also have
[01:35:33.030 --> 01:35:34.030]  an Instagram.
[01:35:34.030 --> 01:35:39.030]  So that's how I got to know many of these med makers was I would get their medicine
[01:35:39.030 --> 01:35:43.030]  and I would tag them in my daily posts, you know.
[01:35:43.030 --> 01:35:47.030]  And Michael has always been very supportive.
[01:35:47.030 --> 01:35:49.030]  Michael Dominique.
[01:35:49.030 --> 01:35:54.030]  And I reached out to him and I said, Hey, is there any chance I could get any of your
[01:35:54.030 --> 01:35:55.030]  hash?
[01:35:55.030 --> 01:35:58.030]  You know, they're not issuing delivery at this point.
[01:35:59.030 --> 01:36:05.030]  And he came straight to me the next day and just said, you know, here, you know, and I
[01:36:05.030 --> 01:36:09.030]  was, I was thrilled by that and touched by that.
[01:36:09.030 --> 01:36:17.030]  And he also introduced me to one of his hash makers, who also, I had never met this, this
[01:36:17.030 --> 01:36:19.030]  young man before.
[01:36:19.030 --> 01:36:24.030]  And he's also sort of supplying me with medicine as well.
[01:36:25.030 --> 01:36:30.030]  So I kind of for the first time inadvertently have my own compassionate care set up, you
[01:36:30.030 --> 01:36:35.030]  know, because of because of COVID, interestingly enough.
[01:36:35.030 --> 01:36:38.030]  Extractors make great friends.
[01:36:38.030 --> 01:36:41.030]  Yeah, the best friend.
[01:36:41.030 --> 01:36:42.030]  Yeah.
[01:36:42.030 --> 01:36:46.030]  I mean, the thing about it is, is that what I've noticed about and it's funny because
[01:36:46.030 --> 01:36:51.030]  for years I was much more on the flower side of things than the extract side of things.
[01:36:51.030 --> 01:36:53.030]  But it's changed in the last two years.
[01:36:53.030 --> 01:36:57.030]  And I've learned a lot more about extraction and been involved in it.
[01:36:57.030 --> 01:37:01.030]  And for me, it's, it's flour and hash.
[01:37:01.030 --> 01:37:04.030]  That's, that seems to be my bread and butter.
[01:37:04.030 --> 01:37:11.030]  Because with flour, flour, I would say takes away the pain, but it doesn't take away this
[01:37:11.030 --> 01:37:12.030]  spasticity.
[01:37:12.030 --> 01:37:18.030]  But you put the two together and it's like the best THC sandwich you could ever hope
[01:37:18.030 --> 01:37:19.030]  to have.
[01:37:19.030 --> 01:37:20.030]  Right.
[01:37:20.030 --> 01:37:26.030]  And I mean, I think honestly that I'm really fascinated by the combination of flour and
[01:37:26.030 --> 01:37:27.030]  extract.
[01:37:27.030 --> 01:37:29.030]  What I what I call infused flour.
[01:37:29.030 --> 01:37:33.030]  And yeah, and that's again in a vaporizer.
[01:37:33.030 --> 01:37:35.030]  It's just the way to go.
[01:37:35.030 --> 01:37:37.030]  Just I yeah, you're right.
[01:37:37.030 --> 01:37:41.030]  I need to get back on that train because for the longest time, that's what I was doing.
[01:37:41.030 --> 01:37:44.030]  And, you know, it No, you're right.
[01:37:44.030 --> 01:37:46.030]  It's a slow creep, but it's fantastic.
[01:37:46.030 --> 01:37:47.030]  Right.
[01:37:47.030 --> 01:37:48.030]  Right.
[01:37:48.030 --> 01:37:49.030]  Yeah.
[01:37:49.030 --> 01:37:54.030]  Michael, what what piques your interest with extracts going forward?
[01:37:54.030 --> 01:37:57.030]  Do you see more opportunities with them?
[01:37:57.030 --> 01:38:00.030]  And distinguish between solvent and solventless?
[01:38:00.030 --> 01:38:02.030]  Are you exploring both?
[01:38:02.030 --> 01:38:03.030]  Yeah.
[01:38:03.030 --> 01:38:10.030]  So mechanical extraction, that's things like water hash, rosin technology, where you actually
[01:38:10.030 --> 01:38:15.030]  squeeze the cannabis and, and effectively, you're getting maple syrup out of it.
[01:38:15.030 --> 01:38:24.030]  The truth is, I'm kind of agnostic about about methods right now, because I'm noticing
[01:38:24.030 --> 01:38:31.030]  chemical differences that are of utility in solvent based extracts that I expected to
[01:38:31.030 --> 01:38:34.030]  see in solventless based extracts.
[01:38:34.030 --> 01:38:38.030]  So solvent extracts take a lot more off the plant.
[01:38:38.030 --> 01:38:39.030]  Okay.
[01:38:39.030 --> 01:38:42.030]  And that can be problematic or that can be beneficial.
[01:38:42.030 --> 01:38:45.030]  I'm finding it in my particular use case to be beneficial.
[01:38:48.030 --> 01:38:51.030]  But I'm very, I'm very agnostic when it comes to technology.
[01:38:51.030 --> 01:38:54.030]  I just want to make sure that it tests really clean.
[01:38:54.030 --> 01:39:00.030]  Can you just give an example of something that it has that you like or are looking for?
[01:39:00.030 --> 01:39:01.030]  Yeah.
[01:39:01.030 --> 01:39:10.030]  So what I find is I get higher terp fractions when I use solvents to extract.
[01:39:10.030 --> 01:39:17.030]  And what's great is, is that I'm incredibly patient with my solvent extract.
[01:39:17.030 --> 01:39:24.030]  So I extract them at insanely low temperatures, like 120 minus 120.
[01:39:24.030 --> 01:39:32.030]  And then what I do is I very, very carefully remove, purge the solvent.
[01:39:33.030 --> 01:39:42.030]  And what I end up with is I end up with a, with a sauce product that then I nucleate the THCA out of.
[01:39:42.030 --> 01:39:47.030]  So I end up with THCA crystals and high terpene extract.
[01:39:47.030 --> 01:39:57.030]  And to me, then I can start to play with cannabinoid ratios and terpene ratios in a very, very rich manner.
[01:39:57.030 --> 01:40:02.030]  If I use mechanical extraction, like taking water hash and then pressing rosin from it,
[01:40:02.030 --> 01:40:09.030]  I'll get an insanely high quality product, but it doesn't have quite the range of chemistry that I'm looking for.
[01:40:09.030 --> 01:40:10.030]  So I think it's fantastic.
[01:40:10.030 --> 01:40:16.030]  I mean, my friends at 710 Lab make basically the best solventless extract in California.
[01:40:16.030 --> 01:40:18.030]  But they're not affordable.
[01:40:18.030 --> 01:40:24.030]  But they're not affordable because they're, they're maniacs.
[01:40:24.030 --> 01:40:26.030]  They do everything by hand.
[01:40:26.030 --> 01:40:33.030]  And, and, and they, they, they hand, I mean, there's no automation basically in their facility.
[01:40:33.030 --> 01:40:36.030]  So their costs are just ridiculous.
[01:40:36.030 --> 01:40:42.030]  And, and they could do efficiencies, but they want to do it their way.
[01:40:42.030 --> 01:40:48.030]  So that's why companies like Rock Garden can provide you with a much less expensive product.
[01:40:48.030 --> 01:40:49.030]  They can scale.
[01:40:49.030 --> 01:40:51.030]  Less clean, you know.
[01:40:52.030 --> 01:40:54.030]  Everything has to be clean now.
[01:40:54.030 --> 01:40:58.030]  I mean, because everything has to be tested if it's going through the system.
[01:40:58.030 --> 01:41:08.030]  My assurance that, you know, metals and pesticide residues and solvents are not going to be there are pretty high because I can look at the COA.
[01:41:08.030 --> 01:41:15.030]  And, and also, I mean, there are certain labs, if I see their COA, and I'm suspicious about one of their results,
[01:41:16.030 --> 01:41:20.030]  I'll just send it through a lab I trust to see if I'm, if they're accurate or not.
[01:41:20.030 --> 01:41:21.030]  Sometimes they aren't.
[01:41:21.030 --> 01:41:23.030]  And the reason they aren't is they're in a rush.
[01:41:23.030 --> 01:41:30.030]  A lot of these labs pump stuff through and that can end up with sloppy chemistry.
[01:41:30.030 --> 01:41:33.030]  And just quickly, what's your solvent of choice?
[01:41:33.030 --> 01:41:35.030]  When you keep mentioning solvent.
[01:41:35.030 --> 01:41:39.030]  Again, I'm kind of agnostic about that.
[01:41:40.030 --> 01:41:51.030]  I mean, I've had, like I used to test butane until I read that the federal inhalation standards for butane are 40% of what you're inhaling for 11 minutes.
[01:41:51.030 --> 01:41:54.030]  That's considered completely safe.
[01:41:54.030 --> 01:41:55.030]  All right.
[01:41:55.030 --> 01:42:01.030]  So concerns about butane residues, they're right now for me, non-existent.
[01:42:02.030 --> 01:42:11.030]  What I was actually really scared of back in the day is that they used odorants in butane so you could smell it if it was leaking.
[01:42:11.030 --> 01:42:17.030]  And those odorants typically are mercaptans and they're really dangerous, especially if you heat them.
[01:42:17.030 --> 01:42:24.030]  And so, so the old open blasting days of butane extracts, that's the reason I never carried that sort of stuff.
[01:42:24.030 --> 01:42:26.030]  With PVC pipes.
[01:42:26.030 --> 01:42:27.030]  Exactly.
[01:42:27.030 --> 01:42:30.030]  So what scares you now?
[01:42:31.030 --> 01:42:33.030]  The scariest thing, let's see, what scares me now?
[01:42:33.030 --> 01:42:37.030]  The only thing that really scares me now is a bad lab.
[01:42:37.030 --> 01:42:41.030]  So in other words, a lab saying that something's clean when it's not.
[01:42:41.030 --> 01:42:48.030]  That's why I've kind of, I really like, I check out my labs like I check out my personal physicians.
[01:42:48.030 --> 01:42:51.030]  I want to know that they're really into it.
[01:42:51.030 --> 01:42:56.030]  They really like what they're doing and really want to learn more about what they're doing.
[01:42:56.030 --> 01:42:59.030]  I mean, the great thing is like, personally, I use SC labs a lot.
[01:42:59.030 --> 01:43:01.030]  I've worked with them for a long time.
[01:43:01.030 --> 01:43:09.030]  I've watched the quality of their chemistry go up and up and up while their throughput goes down and down and down.
[01:43:09.030 --> 01:43:12.030]  They have the longest terpene method in California right now.
[01:43:12.030 --> 01:43:20.030]  Their runs are like 60 minutes for terps, which means the peaks in the result are going to be accurate.
[01:43:20.030 --> 01:43:30.030]  So yeah, so yeah, what concerns me now is just that a lab's going to fool me and that the state does not have enough oversight over the labs to catch the bad apples yet.
[01:43:30.030 --> 01:43:43.030]  I mean, I'm hoping that will come, but it really does need to come because certain things like, I don't want somebody to cut corner on aflatoxin testing because aflatoxins can cause liver cancer.
[01:43:44.030 --> 01:43:53.030]  So I don't want somebody to get aspergillus-infested weed that's putting out these toxins and ingest it and then have liver problems because of it.
[01:43:53.030 --> 01:44:01.030]  So is it just a thing to ask your dispensary where they get their testing from?
[01:44:01.030 --> 01:44:04.030]  Just ask for their COAs. They have to have them.
[01:44:04.030 --> 01:44:05.030]  Yeah.
[01:44:05.030 --> 01:44:06.030]  They have to have them.
[01:44:06.030 --> 01:44:11.030]  And then you're going to get the blank look from most staff.
[01:44:12.030 --> 01:44:19.030]  So just be very, very, very nice and very, very insistent.
[01:44:19.030 --> 01:44:24.030]  Say, I've got this rare condition and I've got a great attorney.
[01:44:25.030 --> 01:44:30.030]  I need to see this COA because if something happens to me, it's really out of my hands.
[01:44:30.030 --> 01:44:40.030]  My attorney and his law firm, Engulf and Devour, just has a reputation for owning businesses that mess with me.
[01:44:40.030 --> 01:44:42.030]  Fair enough.
[01:44:42.030 --> 01:44:45.030]  All right. Well, it's two o'clock.
[01:44:46.030 --> 01:44:49.030]  I guess last words.
[01:44:49.030 --> 01:44:53.030]  Michael, we were talking concerns.
[01:44:53.030 --> 01:44:56.030]  From the doctor, what concerns you?
[01:44:56.030 --> 01:45:02.030]  And one or two final thoughts.
[01:45:02.030 --> 01:45:07.030]  Looking forward, 2020 and beyond.
[01:45:08.030 --> 01:45:24.030]  Well, you know, pushing the idea that, you know, moving cannabis from where it is now to really making it medicine and pushing our studies forward is really my goal.
[01:45:24.030 --> 01:45:31.030]  And I don't think we can rely on the state or the federal government to do this.
[01:45:32.030 --> 01:45:46.030]  I think we need to get together and contribute in a nonprofit way to improving the studies, improving the research on these products so that patients are getting the best medicine.
[01:45:46.030 --> 01:45:52.030]  And absolutely, I'm completely concerned that we're not getting the best medicine.
[01:45:53.030 --> 01:45:59.030]  I talk to many patients all the time and patients do not have money.
[01:45:59.030 --> 01:46:07.030]  The state, the federal government can't think about cannabis as a way to raise funds by taxing patients.
[01:46:07.030 --> 01:46:11.030]  It's not the right way to do it.
[01:46:12.030 --> 01:46:20.030]  As a compassionate society that we're worried about COVID, we're worried about each other being exposed to this virus.
[01:46:20.030 --> 01:46:26.030]  We need to also worry about draining money from the state.
[01:46:27.030 --> 01:46:31.030]  It's insane to think about it that way.
[01:46:31.030 --> 01:46:39.030]  So financially and rigorous science to my heart, I think we need to be able to do this.
[01:46:40.030 --> 01:46:44.030]  Okay, policy expert, what are your final thoughts?
[01:46:44.030 --> 01:46:48.030]  Don't think about it as a policy.
[01:46:48.030 --> 01:46:50.030]  It's a policy.
[01:46:50.030 --> 01:46:52.030]  It's a policy.
[01:46:52.030 --> 01:46:54.030]  It's a policy.
[01:46:54.030 --> 01:46:56.030]  It's a policy.
[01:46:56.030 --> 01:46:58.030]  It's a policy.
[01:46:58.030 --> 01:47:00.030]  It's a policy.
[01:47:00.030 --> 01:47:02.030]  It's a policy.
[01:47:02.030 --> 01:47:04.030]  It's a policy.
[01:47:04.030 --> 01:47:06.030]  It's a policy.
[01:47:06.030 --> 01:47:08.030]  It's a policy.
[01:47:08.030 --> 01:47:14.030]  It's a policy.
[01:47:14.030 --> 01:47:16.030]  It's a policy.
[01:47:16.030 --> 01:47:18.030]  It's a policy.
[01:47:18.030 --> 01:47:20.030]  It's a policy.
[01:47:20.030 --> 01:47:23.030]  It's a policy.
[01:47:26.030 --> 01:47:28.030]  I know that sounds kind of basic.
[01:47:28.030 --> 01:47:32.150]  I never dreamed we'd get this far.
[01:47:32.150 --> 01:47:33.810]  So don't give up.
[01:47:33.810 --> 01:47:37.830]  And when you can do what you can do, help out.
[01:47:37.830 --> 01:47:41.990]  Nobody expects somebody who is poor and sick
[01:47:42.910 --> 01:47:45.710]  to make the same kind of effort
[01:47:45.710 --> 01:47:49.390]  that somebody who's wealthy and well can.
[01:47:49.390 --> 01:47:53.950]  But when that plea comes across your Facebook page
[01:47:53.950 --> 01:47:55.830]  and they want you to click on a link
[01:47:55.830 --> 01:47:58.270]  and fill out a few fields
[01:47:58.270 --> 01:48:02.830]  so a letter goes to your representative, do it.
[01:48:02.830 --> 01:48:05.830]  Because you may think that's a small thing,
[01:48:05.830 --> 01:48:09.990]  but those small things, man, they add up to something big.
[01:48:09.990 --> 01:48:13.730]  And all we have to do is keep marching forward now.
[01:48:13.730 --> 01:48:16.910]  We have turned the corner, believe it or not.
[01:48:16.910 --> 01:48:17.750]  So don't give up.
[01:48:17.750 --> 01:48:22.210]  And Sarah, I have a last quick question for you.
[01:48:23.210 --> 01:48:26.250]  Insurance companies, I thought a few years ago
[01:48:26.250 --> 01:48:28.330]  that they were starting to step up
[01:48:28.330 --> 01:48:31.130]  and they were gonna cover cannabis.
[01:48:31.130 --> 01:48:32.770]  I don't know if that's happening.
[01:48:32.770 --> 01:48:34.450]  How do we put pressure on them?
[01:48:34.450 --> 01:48:37.770]  What can we do to move that forward?
[01:48:37.770 --> 01:48:39.450]  Because it's so important.
[01:48:41.850 --> 01:48:43.530]  It depends on what their links
[01:48:43.530 --> 01:48:45.550]  to the federal government are.
[01:48:46.490 --> 01:48:48.370]  That may well be the sticking point.
[01:48:48.370 --> 01:48:53.370]  I have longed to be able to deduct my cannabis expenses
[01:48:54.130 --> 01:48:57.370]  either off my state income tax
[01:48:57.370 --> 01:49:00.830]  or get reimbursed by insurance.
[01:49:00.830 --> 01:49:02.890]  But I get a real feeling that when it comes
[01:49:02.890 --> 01:49:07.050]  to your health insurance, that there's meaningful ties
[01:49:07.050 --> 01:49:08.770]  to the federal government.
[01:49:08.770 --> 01:49:11.830]  And until we can sort of untie that Gordian knot,
[01:49:13.190 --> 01:49:18.190]  the health providers are gonna be reluctant.
[01:49:18.230 --> 01:49:20.830]  And so the different companies.
[01:49:21.750 --> 01:49:24.210]  So that's another good battle.
[01:49:24.210 --> 01:49:28.030]  Believe me, it's really, really a worthwhile effort.
[01:49:29.110 --> 01:49:33.270]  I also think that we can prove
[01:49:35.470 --> 01:49:37.370]  that cannabis saves them money.
[01:49:38.390 --> 01:49:40.790]  It's not as expensive as a lot
[01:49:40.790 --> 01:49:43.510]  of the pharmaceuticals out there.
[01:49:43.510 --> 01:49:46.070]  And if that's what's motivating them,
[01:49:46.110 --> 01:49:48.910]  then I think it's a good way
[01:49:48.910 --> 01:49:51.710]  to convince insurance companies to support cannabis.
[01:49:53.190 --> 01:49:56.670]  Okay, and the final word will go to Alice,
[01:49:56.670 --> 01:50:01.070]  our patient and the next generation of advocates
[01:50:01.070 --> 01:50:03.730]  who will carry the baton.
[01:50:05.070 --> 01:50:07.270]  All right, well, geez, I'm gonna end it.
[01:50:08.270 --> 01:50:11.270]  I would like to, I hope that we continue talking
[01:50:11.270 --> 01:50:15.350]  after all this because right now,
[01:50:15.350 --> 01:50:17.910]  that's all I have is a network of patients,
[01:50:18.750 --> 01:50:21.430]  which is fantastic and I can do that all day long,
[01:50:21.430 --> 01:50:23.430]  but I hope that we all stay in contact
[01:50:23.430 --> 01:50:27.230]  and we can all make some change together.
[01:50:27.230 --> 01:50:29.030]  I think that'd be fantastic.
[01:50:29.030 --> 01:50:34.030]  And I think disability is nothing to be ashamed of.
[01:50:34.990 --> 01:50:36.950]  Illness is nothing to be ashamed of.
[01:50:36.950 --> 01:50:40.090]  And I think that's what it boils down to as well,
[01:50:40.090 --> 01:50:44.130]  is that most of our government,
[01:50:44.130 --> 01:50:46.890]  I kind of feel maybe doesn't have use
[01:50:46.890 --> 01:50:48.890]  for people with disabilities or illnesses.
[01:50:48.890 --> 01:50:51.730]  And I think that is total top wash
[01:50:51.730 --> 01:50:55.010]  because you look at where we're at now,
[01:50:55.010 --> 01:50:59.130]  I mean, I'm used to, sorry, my dogs are excited.
[01:50:59.130 --> 01:51:02.250]  I'm used to staying at home,
[01:51:02.250 --> 01:51:06.410]  and now the vast majority of people are getting sick
[01:51:06.410 --> 01:51:08.050]  and they're not used to being at home.
[01:51:08.050 --> 01:51:11.490]  And we're the ones that are gonna be the difference.
[01:51:11.490 --> 01:51:13.850]  People with disabilities are the true Buddhas
[01:51:13.850 --> 01:51:15.010]  of the world, I think.
[01:51:18.590 --> 01:51:20.950]  All right, and on that, it's a wrap.
[01:51:20.950 --> 01:51:23.150]  I appreciated everyone.
[01:51:23.150 --> 01:51:26.550]  Thanks for participating and we'll continue
[01:51:26.550 --> 01:51:28.790]  these types of conversations going forward.
[01:51:28.790 --> 01:51:31.870]  So have a good rest of your Tuesday.
[01:51:31.870 --> 01:51:33.150]  Thank you, everyone.
[01:51:33.150 --> 01:51:33.990]  Thank you.
[01:51:33.990 --> 01:51:34.830]  Thank you.
[01:51:34.830 --> 01:51:35.650]  Thank you.
[01:51:35.650 --> 01:51:36.490]  Thank you.
[01:51:36.490 --> 01:51:37.330]  Thank you.
[01:51:37.330 --> 01:51:38.150]  Thank you.
[01:51:38.150 --> 01:51:40.390]  Thank you.
[01:51:40.390 --> 01:51:41.550]  Thank you.
