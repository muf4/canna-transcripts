[00:01.660 --> 00:04.660]  And just as we go live one of them walks away
[00:06.340 --> 00:14.120]  All right, mr. Joe, can you can you quickly show the shirt? Oh, yeah, we can do the shirt. Yeah number 16
[00:17.080 --> 00:23.200]  Yeah, big day for you today, it's a big day man, I'll take whatever I can get I usually sleep in my jerseys
[00:23.680 --> 00:28.820]  Just kidding. But uh, you know, I'm really excited about today's game last week's game was insane
[00:29.460 --> 00:34.180]  Walk off field goals, not just the Niners game, but all of the games last weekend were crazy
[00:35.060 --> 00:40.500]  Football is a you know, it's pretty amazing sport. I love baseball. I love sports in general
[00:41.820 --> 00:45.860]  You know, I'm not much of a gambler, but I do love my Bay Area teams
[00:45.860 --> 00:50.020]  I was kind of raised to support the local team. So I'm not just a Giants fan
[00:50.020 --> 00:53.980]  I'm an A's fan a Giants fan. I think my father talked to me when I was younger about
[00:54.900 --> 00:58.140]  The sports teams how they bring in money for the economy. He had a
[00:58.820 --> 01:03.300]  Talk with me when I was really young and probably probably like 12 or 13 and I still kind of remember
[01:03.620 --> 01:09.900]  Him talking about how sports teams bring in money for the local economy and he was talking about the Giants and A's
[01:09.900 --> 01:13.080]  I bet he doesn't even remember the conversation, but I vividly do
[01:14.180 --> 01:17.140]  And so I support the A's the Giants the Sharks
[01:17.860 --> 01:20.020]  the Niners, you know when the when the
[01:20.540 --> 01:25.100]  Raiders were here. I'm very supportive of the Raiders all these things because they bring money into the local economy
[01:25.100 --> 01:27.620]  So I think that's a positive thing for sports
[01:28.260 --> 01:33.340]  Regardless of how you look at it. I think it's a good thing. So what are you thinking about this weekend Peter?
[01:36.320 --> 01:38.320]  I'd love to see the Bengals win
[01:39.120 --> 01:41.120]  yeah, and I
[01:41.800 --> 01:47.840]  Guess I'm into yeah, I guess I mean it'd be fun to see the Niners go. I mean, I actually I
[01:48.360 --> 01:50.360]  like Matt Stafford, I mean, I'm
[01:51.480 --> 01:53.480]  my mom I think
[01:53.720 --> 02:00.480]  Either yesterday or the day before asked me if I've started to like LA sports teams and I was like no
[02:01.320 --> 02:04.520]  So I'm all New England all the time. So
[02:05.280 --> 02:09.880]  Like when I lived in New York, I hated the Yankees. I hate the Lakers
[02:11.960 --> 02:15.240]  Yeah, I mean, you know there's there's lots of ways to look at it but
[02:16.160 --> 02:22.040]  Definitely, so we got a really awesome show today. I'm really excited to kind of talk about our guests
[02:22.640 --> 02:24.280]  We have
[02:24.280 --> 02:27.640]  My friend Gordon who's gonna be on here. He's also business partner
[02:28.480 --> 02:32.560]  With a company called culture of our Alliance and we're gonna be talking about
[02:33.240 --> 02:36.360]  Some cool breeding stuff that Gordon's been doing over the years
[02:38.000 --> 02:42.600]  Especially population outcrossing and then we've got Jamal Steven grasshopper
[02:43.400 --> 02:47.280]  they are from the East Bay seed collective and
[02:47.720 --> 02:52.320]  Jamal is from I Lee seeds and I'm not sure about the other guys seed companies
[02:52.600 --> 02:55.120]  But we're gonna be talking about land-raised stuff with them
[02:55.480 --> 03:01.220]  So Gordon, do you have a couple minutes to tell us a little bit about yourself and your history with breeding?
[03:03.760 --> 03:05.760]  Yeah, so
[03:06.800 --> 03:09.280]  Let's see where to start I
[03:10.240 --> 03:16.560]  I guess I'll start I dropped out of high school when I was 16 because I was
[03:16.800 --> 03:24.360]  looking for a better education, honestly, and I decided that I was interested in farming and
[03:25.280 --> 03:27.280]  That there were a lot of reasons
[03:28.640 --> 03:30.640]  You know a lot of I guess
[03:31.960 --> 03:37.040]  Primarily social activism reasons to be involved in farming and
[03:39.160 --> 03:42.480]  So I started doing farm apprenticeships at that time
[03:43.480 --> 03:46.360]  Worked on a whole variety of different farms
[03:47.360 --> 03:48.640]  everything from
[03:48.640 --> 03:50.640]  dairying and logging to
[03:51.200 --> 03:53.280]  specialty greens and seeds
[03:54.720 --> 03:56.720]  and
[03:56.920 --> 03:58.920]  And
[03:59.240 --> 04:01.240]  Then I
[04:01.720 --> 04:08.240]  Guess in my early 20s. I met the woman who would become my wife and is still my wife
[04:09.400 --> 04:11.400]  Rowan white and
[04:12.160 --> 04:14.160]  The two of us
[04:15.240 --> 04:18.560]  Found that we were really in love with seed and
[04:20.000 --> 04:22.000]  So we have been
[04:22.760 --> 04:24.760]  seed stewards
[04:25.600 --> 04:29.720]  Since that time which is a little over 20 years now
[04:31.280 --> 04:32.960]  And
[04:32.960 --> 04:38.400]  so we I mean just here on our own farm we maintain a
[04:39.400 --> 04:41.400]  Collection of I
[04:42.600 --> 04:45.960]  Honestly don't know what the count is at this point in time, but it's somewhere
[04:47.000 --> 04:54.320]  Mmm, probably getting close to 400 different varieties that we keep and maintain here
[04:55.440 --> 04:57.440]  and
[04:58.720 --> 05:05.360]  So, you know if you're going to take care of seed, you know, then
[05:05.440 --> 05:10.240]  You know, there's a certain amount of selection that will take place
[05:11.400 --> 05:13.960]  either consciously or unconsciously and
[05:14.720 --> 05:16.720]  and so we try to be
[05:17.600 --> 05:19.600]  conscious of
[05:19.640 --> 05:21.640]  the selections that we do
[05:22.640 --> 05:25.600]  In how we maintain our populations
[05:26.520 --> 05:28.520]  and our seed lots and
[05:30.640 --> 05:32.640]  So then all of a sudden
[05:33.440 --> 05:36.560]  So then all of a sudden that is plant breeding
[05:38.640 --> 05:45.280]  Once you once you start recognizing, you know, I mean that's kind of in its its most elemental form
[05:46.240 --> 05:47.760]  and
[05:47.760 --> 05:50.520]  so now over the years we have
[05:51.800 --> 05:53.800]  You know continued to educate ourselves
[05:55.600 --> 05:58.840]  You know quite a bit and and
[05:59.440 --> 06:01.440]  And
[06:01.640 --> 06:08.320]  So back about 15 years or so ago 15 16 years now I
[06:11.560 --> 06:13.560]  Started applying some of that
[06:14.680 --> 06:18.960]  knowledge in those practices with cannabis as well and
[06:21.520 --> 06:23.520]  You know, and so I
[06:23.880 --> 06:26.840]  Think that's part of why I'm in the conversation today
[06:27.840 --> 06:33.280]  For me that process started with population outcrossing
[06:34.920 --> 06:36.920]  That
[06:38.360 --> 06:40.800]  Seems like a very important
[06:43.320 --> 06:46.680]  Practice in general in the in the plant breeding world, but
[06:47.760 --> 06:50.880]  you know, particularly when we're talking about
[06:51.000 --> 06:55.840]  Starting with very small quantities of seed or
[06:56.880 --> 06:58.880]  genetic lines that have
[07:00.200 --> 07:03.800]  You know that just have that have small populations that have been
[07:04.680 --> 07:09.800]  You know where there's been a lot of inbreeding or very aggressive
[07:11.920 --> 07:13.920]  Pedigree breeding approaches
[07:15.080 --> 07:17.080]  You know, that's
[07:17.080 --> 07:20.880]  Anytime where you're really narrowing the genetic funnel
[07:21.960 --> 07:23.960]  Yes, you can get some
[07:24.880 --> 07:26.880]  You know some some dramatic
[07:28.000 --> 07:31.200]  Results from doing that you can get some outstanding cultivars
[07:32.800 --> 07:34.800]  But there is also
[07:37.360 --> 07:41.040]  You know a certain weakening that can take place in that process
[07:41.760 --> 07:43.760]  by limiting
[07:43.760 --> 07:45.760]  genetic diversity and
[07:45.800 --> 07:47.800]  You know going into a more
[07:49.640 --> 07:53.280]  You know like a more vertical approach to plant breeding
[07:54.600 --> 08:00.120]  and I am of the school of thought that
[08:00.960 --> 08:02.960]  that I prefer the the
[08:04.240 --> 08:07.680]  Horizontal approach to to breeding which is
[08:08.800 --> 08:10.800]  You know greater diversity
[08:11.520 --> 08:13.520]  You know moving moving
[08:13.560 --> 08:21.480]  You know moving moving in a direction of more like heterozygosity than homozygosity and
[08:25.400 --> 08:27.400]  So
[08:28.160 --> 08:29.720]  That
[08:29.720 --> 08:33.960]  Now I'm I should make the caveat on that. I'm not opposed to
[08:34.960 --> 08:37.360]  You know to vertical or pedigree breeding
[08:38.520 --> 08:40.520]  But I think that any
[08:41.120 --> 08:42.200]  responsible
[08:42.200 --> 08:44.680]  seed steward also needs to
[08:46.720 --> 08:48.720]  To keep a mind for
[08:51.720 --> 08:59.360]  What we have inherited in the form of seeds these are the processes of
[09:01.080 --> 09:03.520]  Really countless generations of
[09:06.480 --> 09:10.840]  Human interaction with our plant relatives and
[09:13.040 --> 09:16.120]  And if we're just
[09:18.160 --> 09:24.480]  Looking for what traits or attributes are applicable for our
[09:25.560 --> 09:27.560]  current day and age
[09:28.040 --> 09:30.040]  then we are
[09:32.280 --> 09:37.880]  We're acting without awareness to perhaps the magnitude of
[09:38.480 --> 09:40.480]  The value of that inheritance
[09:42.480 --> 09:47.560]  As in like what it would take to make all of that again from scratch is
[09:50.200 --> 09:52.680]  Again you're talking about countless generations
[09:54.080 --> 09:56.080]  So
[09:56.680 --> 10:02.920]  You know, so so we have a certain obligation from my perspective we have a certain obligation to
[10:03.760 --> 10:05.760]  To be responsible stewards
[10:07.320 --> 10:08.680]  To
[10:08.680 --> 10:13.320]  To all of this genetic diversity, which is brought about by you know
[10:13.320 --> 10:16.600]  All these all these human generations all these human hands all this
[10:17.880 --> 10:19.880]  involvement
[10:19.920 --> 10:25.200]  That we that we have with these plants and so
[10:27.080 --> 10:29.080]  So population outcrossing
[10:30.120 --> 10:32.120]  Or
[10:32.840 --> 10:35.080]  You know open pollinated
[10:38.200 --> 10:40.200]  Seed lots are
[10:40.280 --> 10:41.880]  I think
[10:41.880 --> 10:47.480]  essential to maintain and so when I started working with
[10:48.480 --> 10:49.840]  cannabis
[10:49.840 --> 10:51.160]  I
[10:51.160 --> 10:55.960]  Applied really the same approach that I would in working with
[10:56.560 --> 11:01.800]  You know a seed lot because we do we do a lot of seed restoration here
[11:03.200 --> 11:05.680]  With particularly a lot of
[11:06.880 --> 11:10.640]  You know indigenous Native American crop varietals
[11:13.000 --> 11:15.000]  And
[11:16.600 --> 11:23.760]  So it is not uncommon for us to get a very small lot as in, you know, maybe
[11:24.280 --> 11:30.560]  Six or twelve or twenty seeds of say a corn
[11:31.080 --> 11:33.080]  that is very
[11:34.440 --> 11:36.440]  You know very endangered and
[11:39.400 --> 11:41.880]  And so what we will do with that
[11:42.920 --> 11:44.640]  is
[11:44.640 --> 11:48.440]  You know is a process of restoration
[11:48.480 --> 11:50.480]  That takes several generations
[11:51.240 --> 11:52.760]  to
[11:52.760 --> 11:55.240]  you know to revitalize a
[11:56.360 --> 11:58.360]  Population and we're not doing any
[11:59.640 --> 12:01.640]  Selection
[12:02.200 --> 12:09.480]  Or as you know, I guess you're always doing a certain amount of selection if you depending on how you want to define that term but
[12:11.120 --> 12:13.120]  As minimally as possible
[12:14.040 --> 12:16.040]  to
[12:16.600 --> 12:18.600]  Try and
[12:20.920 --> 12:25.600]  Sort of reopen the the doors of genetic possibility
[12:27.400 --> 12:31.400]  So, maybe that's a good start yeah, I think that's a good start and maybe
[12:32.040 --> 12:37.800]  Discussing on the most basic term. What is population not crossing and how is it done if you have six seeds?
[12:38.120 --> 12:40.760]  How do you go about taking six seeds and?
[12:40.760 --> 12:46.560]  Using those six seeds to to increase the genetic diversity and do some outcrossing. What would your
[12:48.080 --> 12:53.920]  Okay, so basically I mean it depends on you know, I guess which six seeds you have
[12:54.440 --> 12:56.440]  you know in the in the
[12:57.240 --> 13:03.360]  In the instance of cannabis, you know, we're talking about a dioecious plant. So we have you know, we have
[13:04.240 --> 13:08.000]  Individual, you know like male and female are
[13:08.120 --> 13:15.360]  You know as opposed to say corn which which is not where the the male and female
[13:16.160 --> 13:18.880]  Flowers occur on the on the same plant
[13:20.800 --> 13:22.800]  So in dealing with
[13:23.800 --> 13:25.800]  With cannabis in that way
[13:27.720 --> 13:29.240]  What
[13:29.240 --> 13:32.640]  What I would do is that I would germinate
[13:32.640 --> 13:36.920]  And I would create an environment where they can
[13:39.160 --> 13:42.680]  You know where they can engage in their reproductive lifestyle
[13:43.720 --> 13:49.160]  You know so that they can you know, they can they can pollinate each other
[13:50.080 --> 13:53.440]  And so, you know at that point in time, I'm not
[13:55.000 --> 13:57.000]  There's my rooster
[13:57.000 --> 13:59.000]  You know
[13:59.000 --> 14:01.000]  I
[14:01.000 --> 14:06.440]  Get okay. So basically at that point in time, we're not doing any selection. We're not doing any
[14:07.320 --> 14:09.320]  stem rubs or
[14:09.880 --> 14:15.720]  Anything where we're trying to identify either on the male side or the female side
[14:15.720 --> 14:17.720]  We're not doing any
[14:18.280 --> 14:20.280]  stem rubs or
[14:20.680 --> 14:22.360]  anything where we're
[14:22.360 --> 14:28.120]  Trying to identify either on the male side or the female side who we want
[14:29.560 --> 14:31.000]  to produce
[14:31.000 --> 14:32.840]  seed from
[14:32.840 --> 14:34.360]  we are
[14:34.360 --> 14:39.240]  Allowing them to reproduce naturally without any selection. And so that's
[14:39.800 --> 14:42.520]  You know, that's that's the first generation of doing that
[14:44.760 --> 14:49.980]  And then because we are starting with such a narrow
[14:52.840 --> 14:55.160]  Band of the spectrum of
[14:56.760 --> 14:58.520]  Whatever that
[14:58.520 --> 15:02.360]  Seed lines heritage is wherever that seed line comes from
[15:03.960 --> 15:07.720]  You know if there's only six seeds that make it into our hands
[15:08.680 --> 15:10.680]  then
[15:11.640 --> 15:17.880]  You know, that's that that's a very uh narrow band so we want to then take that
[15:18.680 --> 15:19.800]  uh
[15:19.800 --> 15:22.840]  That outcrossing process and we want to repeat that
[15:23.320 --> 15:28.940]  Uh through several generations and we want to try and build up to larger and larger populations
[15:29.880 --> 15:35.480]  uh in the process of doing that so, you know as anybody who works with seeds knows it's like
[15:36.840 --> 15:42.200]  You know, you can start with one or you know six, uh, and uh,
[15:43.320 --> 15:45.420]  And and they multiply exponentially
[15:46.300 --> 15:49.420]  um, so even though you're starting with six you can
[15:50.060 --> 15:55.740]  uh, you know in your second generation, you could be in a position where you're looking at doing
[15:57.260 --> 15:59.740]  You know two or three or four or five hundred
[16:02.060 --> 16:05.660]  Seeds just from that initial cross and
[16:08.460 --> 16:09.660]  And then
[16:09.660 --> 16:12.140]  Repeating that process again. Now you're going to
[16:13.180 --> 16:14.920]  a much larger
[16:14.980 --> 16:16.980]  population and
[16:17.160 --> 16:19.160]  you're allowing
[16:19.480 --> 16:21.480]  the uh
[16:21.480 --> 16:23.480]  the expression of
[16:24.040 --> 16:26.040]  a much broader
[16:28.040 --> 16:30.040]  You know swath of that spectrum
[16:31.080 --> 16:33.080]  uh, so you get to see
[16:33.160 --> 16:36.520]  uh, you know some of the uh, the other
[16:37.400 --> 16:40.040]  Traits that are carried in that line you get to see
[16:40.600 --> 16:42.600]  uh some of the combinations
[16:42.680 --> 16:45.480]  Uh some of the expressions of you know, like
[16:46.600 --> 16:47.560]  you know
[16:47.560 --> 16:53.000]  Double recessive traits or that kind of thing. Uh, so that's really
[16:53.800 --> 16:55.800]  um
[16:56.280 --> 17:01.160]  You know that and there's also another element to that which is that in order
[17:02.040 --> 17:03.400]  for
[17:03.400 --> 17:08.440]  Cannabis to remain healthy and usually when I talk about this with people i'm like
[17:09.080 --> 17:11.320]  Cannabis is a lot like people, you know
[17:11.560 --> 17:13.720]  uh, we are also
[17:14.600 --> 17:15.860]  uh
[17:15.860 --> 17:21.880]  Diascius in that regard is that you know, it takes a man and a woman. Uh, we do not
[17:22.920 --> 17:24.920]  We we cannot reproduce independently
[17:25.880 --> 17:27.320]  and
[17:27.320 --> 17:29.320]  just like people
[17:29.320 --> 17:31.320]  uh, if you are
[17:31.620 --> 17:33.000]  reproducing
[17:33.000 --> 17:33.960]  in
[17:33.960 --> 17:35.960]  a very small population
[17:36.600 --> 17:38.700]  You're getting into inbreeding
[17:39.580 --> 17:40.620]  uh
[17:40.620 --> 17:41.580]  and
[17:41.580 --> 17:48.220]  You know, I mean we've and I mean we've seen that in in human populations. I mean that's like a sort of classically
[17:48.620 --> 17:49.580]  uh
[17:49.580 --> 17:51.580]  royal approach to it where
[17:52.140 --> 17:53.980]  you know the the
[17:53.980 --> 17:59.420]  The brother and the sister will marry uh to keep power consolidated within the family
[18:00.380 --> 18:07.020]  and uh, and after several generations of that happening you end up with
[18:07.900 --> 18:14.860]  Uh, you know some of the like genetic diseases that have run through uh, those family lines
[18:16.140 --> 18:18.140]  And cannabis is the same way
[18:18.620 --> 18:20.620]  uh, so
[18:21.100 --> 18:23.740]  Being able to uh to
[18:25.100 --> 18:30.860]  You know have that greater diversity, uh of potential matches
[18:31.660 --> 18:33.100]  um
[18:33.100 --> 18:36.060]  is is really like an essential aspect of
[18:36.860 --> 18:40.540]  The health of any given cannabis seed line
[18:41.340 --> 18:43.340]  uh, so
[18:43.740 --> 18:49.500]  You know population outcrossing I guess very simply put is just the uh,
[18:50.620 --> 18:52.620]  You know the maintenance of that
[18:52.700 --> 18:58.140]  Uh diverse population so that you are not ending up with inbreeding depression
[18:59.020 --> 18:59.980]  right
[18:59.980 --> 19:04.620]  Perfect. Yeah. I mean on a side note there are moniscious. I know somebody's going to say it in the chat
[19:04.700 --> 19:07.900]  So i'm going to beat him to the punch, but there are moniscious cannabis plants
[19:08.300 --> 19:12.620]  Uh, there are indeed. Yep. It can be both moniscious and dietitian
[19:13.260 --> 19:19.580]  Uh, I think even the monisha side we can we can trace it back to like southeastern asia
[19:20.540 --> 19:23.980]  Um, and so that is something that's been bred into the lines
[19:24.540 --> 19:29.180]  Um, probably by accident I would say I think most people wouldn't want to work with stuff. That's moniscious
[19:29.740 --> 19:31.740]  uh, unless they're working with maybe like
[19:32.140 --> 19:34.860]  Trying to get hemp seed and doing a combination of things but
[19:35.740 --> 19:39.020]  Cannabis can be both but diatious is what we're trying to achieve
[19:39.580 --> 19:43.420]  and we're trying to breed out those things, but they also show up as recessive traits, so
[19:44.220 --> 19:47.420]  Sometimes until you have recessive on both sides, it doesn't express
[19:48.060 --> 19:52.300]  So they can pass for multiple generations and then you cross them with something and all of a sudden wow
[19:52.780 --> 19:55.340]  either cross them within itself and it basically
[19:56.140 --> 19:58.620]  Uh in a inbred line you can get it
[19:59.260 --> 20:02.380]  Or even you know in an f1 you can get it. I mean there's
[20:02.940 --> 20:04.940]  Several ways you can get those but yeah
[20:05.020 --> 20:13.260]  I mean, I think the idea with population outcrossing you you can take two separate genetics and do population outcrossing as well by crossing them together
[20:13.900 --> 20:16.400]  uh in search of recessive traits and diversity
[20:17.260 --> 20:18.620]  and
[20:18.620 --> 20:20.380]  Yes
[20:20.380 --> 20:26.700]  Yeah, and yeah, there's there's definitely exceptions, uh to those rules really like across
[20:27.180 --> 20:29.180]  uh all
[20:29.180 --> 20:34.700]  You know like all these different plant species, uh, yeah, you know domesticates anyways
[20:35.340 --> 20:36.780]  um
[20:36.780 --> 20:40.140]  Yeah, there's there's there's always the exception to prove the rule, of course
[20:40.380 --> 20:43.820]  um, but then there's also the aspect of it that uh,
[20:44.460 --> 20:48.620]  For most of us who are involved, uh in working with cannabis
[20:49.180 --> 20:50.860]  uh that
[20:50.860 --> 20:55.340]  uh that hermaphroditic or monascious tendency is
[20:55.740 --> 20:58.540]  Uh is not a desirable trait
[20:59.500 --> 21:02.540]  No, it's a it's undesirable intersexual trait in
[21:03.180 --> 21:06.060]  Steve i'm glad to have you on uh, nice to meet you
[21:07.260 --> 21:11.100]  I've heard good. Thank you for having me. Thank you. It's nice to be here
[21:12.540 --> 21:17.500]  So we'll jump into some introductions with these guys gordon just real quickly and uh, if you want
[21:18.060 --> 21:22.220]  Conversation, but yeah, steve, you want to tell us a little bit about yourself and what you do?
[21:22.940 --> 21:24.460]  sure, i'm
[21:24.460 --> 21:30.220]  Definitely, I would consider myself more on the art side than the science side of things. Um,
[21:30.860 --> 21:32.460]  although i've been
[21:32.460 --> 21:34.460]  working with the plants for
[21:34.780 --> 21:39.740]  Probably 30 years now i've been um making crosses and having fun basically
[21:40.380 --> 21:46.700]  And not until about the last 10 years have I really started to take breeding seriously. I wouldn't call myself a breeder but
[21:47.260 --> 21:50.140]  Just more conscientious about what i'm crossing
[21:50.940 --> 21:52.940]  um where i'm sourcing things from
[21:53.660 --> 21:58.620]  And um, i'm in a place where i'm able to grow outdoors now, so i'm
[21:59.980 --> 22:05.420]  I've had a lot of issues. I have great environment here, but I have a lot of humidity in the morning
[22:05.420 --> 22:09.740]  so i've had a lot of pm issues with a lot of different strains and so
[22:10.540 --> 22:13.500]  I've i've worked with a lot of chems and um
[22:14.380 --> 22:18.620]  I mean i'm still i'm old school. I'm still looking for skunk in a way, but right
[22:18.860 --> 22:20.860]  I think you are in a way for sure
[22:21.020 --> 22:28.620]  Yeah, um and to the point where i'm trying to reverse engineer it by just working with that's one of the things that
[22:29.580 --> 22:32.560]  Has drawn me towards more land race equatorial
[22:33.180 --> 22:34.780]  south american
[22:34.780 --> 22:36.460]  um sativas
[22:36.460 --> 22:39.580]  just working with a lot of colombians and
[22:40.540 --> 22:42.540]  This year it was a lot of panama red
[22:43.340 --> 22:47.100]  and um some different like foto rojo and
[22:47.740 --> 22:49.740]  Um
[22:49.880 --> 22:53.040]  Acapulco gold a lot of you know, those classics
[22:54.060 --> 23:00.540]  and just kind of first doing an open pollination basically preserving each line like that and then
[23:01.500 --> 23:06.060]  I'm about to do some crosses with them and i've just found them to be really hardy
[23:06.780 --> 23:08.780]  really stable
[23:09.260 --> 23:11.260]  Yeah, really stable and just
[23:11.900 --> 23:17.020]  Almost they're so fun to grow because they're like jurassic almost it's just like something you've
[23:17.900 --> 23:22.700]  I it's something i've never witnessed, you know this year and some of these plants were just amazing
[23:23.500 --> 23:27.820]  so one of those cool things about working with high humidity regions or regions that are
[23:28.700 --> 23:31.040]  prone to powdery mildew or betritus
[23:31.740 --> 23:34.540]  You can actually select for things that are resistant to it
[23:35.020 --> 23:40.320]  I think a lot of people hate on having to grow coastal but in some ways there's benefits
[23:41.040 --> 23:44.560]  To growing coastal such as you know being able to select for
[23:45.120 --> 23:46.720]  powdery mildew obvious
[23:46.720 --> 23:52.480]  Betritus and powdery mildew resistant when you know how you have a population and there's only a handful of those varieties
[23:52.560 --> 23:54.960]  It's real easy to pick out the ones that don't get powdery mildew
[23:56.240 --> 23:58.720]  Yes, i've i've experienced that this year with uh
[23:58.960 --> 24:04.000]  One plant just laying on top of another plant that that was just covered in powdery mildew and the one
[24:04.400 --> 24:06.400]  the the congolese red just
[24:06.720 --> 24:08.720]  Nothing just rock solid
[24:08.960 --> 24:13.760]  And I let that plant go till late december multiple rains and just
[24:14.800 --> 24:16.800]  Just didn't even bother it
[24:17.120 --> 24:19.040]  Finished really well
[24:19.040 --> 24:23.680]  So we got jamal here too. How you doing? Jamal jamal's been on the show before you guys remember jamal
[24:24.560 --> 24:26.560]  Hey, i'm, well james. How are you?
[24:26.620 --> 24:30.880]  Fantastic. So you've done a lot in the last year. I think you got some gray hair too that you didn't have
[24:31.280 --> 24:34.160]  Yeah, so actually shoot in the last year. I've had a kid
[24:35.120 --> 24:36.880]  um
[24:36.880 --> 24:40.960]  and uh moved into a new house and done a lot of breeding
[24:41.600 --> 24:42.720]  um
[24:42.720 --> 24:44.720]  Yeah
[24:45.600 --> 24:50.560]  Yeah, why don't you talk about what you've done in the last year eileen seeds you want to give us a little uh
[24:50.780 --> 24:54.080]  Introduction on yourself for those of you that don't remember jamal
[24:54.960 --> 25:00.240]  Sure. My name is jamal. I'm the head of uh east bay seed collective or i'm the founding member
[25:00.640 --> 25:04.560]  What east bay seed collective is it's a collective of like-minded people
[25:05.280 --> 25:09.380]  Who are into uh heirloom and land race preservation
[25:10.080 --> 25:12.320]  And we're just general strain nerds
[25:13.040 --> 25:15.600]  we meet twice a month and we
[25:16.320 --> 25:17.900]  talk about
[25:17.900 --> 25:22.800]  Genetics, we talk about various podcasts such as the james loud show
[25:23.740 --> 25:25.740]  episodes like hoplite and virus
[25:26.560 --> 25:31.840]  And you know mainly genetics and we debate we study. Um
[25:32.800 --> 25:37.440]  But yeah, the three main tenants of our group is one we're developing a seed library
[25:38.000 --> 25:44.160]  Of land race and heirloom genetics and I kind of like the term heirloom because a lot of times in our group we will debate
[25:44.800 --> 25:46.880]  the term land race for hours
[25:47.680 --> 25:48.880]  um
[25:48.880 --> 25:55.780]  And so I lose I use like point of origin or heirloom genetics, which are you know genetics that are from a specific location
[25:56.480 --> 25:58.480]  That aren't heavily hybridized
[25:58.720 --> 25:59.680]  um
[25:59.680 --> 26:02.180]  The other things that we do is we also have barbecues
[26:03.360 --> 26:08.480]  Um that are also seed swaps which are super fun. We eat a lot of good food
[26:09.280 --> 26:11.520]  trade seeds and smoke down
[26:12.400 --> 26:13.760]  um
[26:13.760 --> 26:18.080]  Yeah, that's uh, that's what I that's what east bay seed collective is about
[26:19.040 --> 26:22.240]  This past year i've done. Um
[26:23.120 --> 26:26.320]  Some cool breeding and you know for me the main part of breeding
[26:26.480 --> 26:32.640]  Which is a lot of what i've learned from you james is is really growing and learning the strength and figuring out what is worth breeding
[26:32.800 --> 26:38.720]  and for land race genetics or heirloom genetics a lot of it is learning for yourself because
[26:40.000 --> 26:45.780]  Most many people nowadays have not grown panama red have not grown congolese have not grown punta roja
[26:46.320 --> 26:49.700]  And don't know what the strengths and weaknesses are of these genetics
[26:50.160 --> 26:55.120]  So for me, my latest joy is really diving into these genetics growing them
[26:56.000 --> 26:58.000]  Making crosses with them
[26:58.240 --> 26:59.280]  um
[26:59.280 --> 27:06.480]  But mainly growing them and smoking it and figuring out what the strengths and weaknesses are of these specific genetics, uh something
[27:07.200 --> 27:14.720]  Really priceless that i've learned from grasshopper who's one of our members who's you know on this on this thing is um this podcast
[27:15.600 --> 27:17.600]  Is you know really being selective?
[27:18.080 --> 27:20.960]  especially with land race or heirloom genetics
[27:21.280 --> 27:25.440]  Being selective of if you're using a male or female because the males and the females bring
[27:26.000 --> 27:28.000]  very different things to the table
[27:28.320 --> 27:29.920]  and you can
[27:29.920 --> 27:36.160]  Degrade a genetic if you don't choose the right parent for that if you don't choose the right pairing
[27:36.880 --> 27:38.880]  and
[27:38.880 --> 27:43.760]  You do need to be very selective with your with your selections and
[27:44.720 --> 27:50.000]  You know, it's okay to grow out a bunch of things and decide that it's you know, not worth putting forward. So
[27:51.280 --> 27:56.160]  So this past year i've just really i've learned to be ultra ultra picky
[27:56.960 --> 27:58.960]  and mega focused
[27:59.200 --> 28:05.520]  Because you know in our group there's so many genetics flying around people have all this stuff. That's really awesome
[28:06.640 --> 28:08.640]  but
[28:09.120 --> 28:15.780]  As i'm, you know really becoming a breeder i'm learning that these are long-term relationships that you're developing with these genetics
[28:16.400 --> 28:17.840]  and
[28:17.840 --> 28:24.080]  You know once you've made a couple steps forward, you know, you can't really change your mind decide to move in other direction
[28:24.160 --> 28:26.000]  like you really need to
[28:26.000 --> 28:31.200]  Make the right choice and kind of now what i'm realizing it's very similar to a relationship with the human
[28:31.760 --> 28:35.380]  You know in that you really need to learn from your past relationships
[28:36.240 --> 28:42.000]  And be very selective and then when you are really selective and you are really focused on what you're doing
[28:42.080 --> 28:44.080]  you can really have some awesome things and
[28:44.880 --> 28:50.400]  When you're able to make a specific combination that has these particular traits you're looking for
[28:51.360 --> 28:57.360]  Just like a really valuable friend. It's you know, it's so valuable and now especially with this group
[28:58.320 --> 29:00.320]  When you have specific characteristics
[29:00.480 --> 29:06.480]  The main thing that I almost really like is instead of discovering characteristics for myself discovering characteristics for
[29:07.040 --> 29:13.200]  My other club members so like i'll find a strain that does a specific thing and a certain member
[29:13.280 --> 29:17.760]  I'm, like man, you gotta have this. This is for you. This isn't really for me or it's okay, but
[29:18.320 --> 29:20.400]  For your particular setup, you know
[29:21.200 --> 29:23.200]  It will it will work. Um
[29:23.840 --> 29:24.720]  so
[29:24.720 --> 29:25.680]  You know
[29:25.680 --> 29:28.560]  i've now um actually today our
[29:29.280 --> 29:33.360]  Website is launched for ilyseed. So, you know, we're starting to sell seeds
[29:34.320 --> 29:37.280]  um, but I mean the main part of the journey is just really
[29:38.080 --> 29:45.140]  You know truly diving into what it is to look into these genetics and to like basically shepherd them in specific directions
[29:46.320 --> 29:53.600]  Totally, I think what's good is so subjective to the individual. It's it's amazing what what I think is good and what
[29:54.720 --> 29:57.360]  other people think is good is sometimes very different I think
[29:58.160 --> 30:02.640]  I have a group of friends and I think we're all very like-minded on what we think is good
[30:02.880 --> 30:06.400]  And sometimes it has nothing to do the way with the way it looks
[30:06.960 --> 30:09.520]  It has to do with the smell the taste and the effect
[30:10.160 --> 30:15.760]  Uh, there's nothing wrong with that. But as far as for breeding for commercial application, that can be a different thing
[30:15.840 --> 30:17.920]  so there's so many different approaches you can have and
[30:18.400 --> 30:24.400]  It's so cannabis is so subjective just like food and all these other things. Some people like pizza. Some people don't like pizza
[30:25.440 --> 30:32.480]  But yeah breeding is it is it's your you're learning though, you know, it's a lifelong thing, you know, that's we were talking about master
[30:33.280 --> 30:35.280]  Growers the other day and it's like
[30:35.360 --> 30:39.520]  You don't really master growing ever like you you get to a certain point where you know how to grow
[30:39.520 --> 30:42.560]  well, and you know how to but you you're constantly learning in the
[30:43.520 --> 30:46.000]  Especially with indoor cultivation is constantly evolving
[30:46.800 --> 30:48.480]  I thought
[30:48.480 --> 30:55.360]  We got grasshopper on so let's talk to grasshopper for a second. I've been waiting to talk to grasshopper. How you doing grasshopper?
[30:57.440 --> 30:59.200]  Hey james
[30:59.200 --> 31:01.200]  Man, thank you for coming on
[31:01.200 --> 31:04.000]  Yeah, thank you guys too for having me. I appreciate it. Um
[31:05.680 --> 31:08.560]  Yeah, so, uh, let me see where I start um
[31:10.080 --> 31:16.000]  You know first i'm grateful for you know for all the information that you guys provide on this show
[31:16.400 --> 31:22.720]  You know, that was how I was able to meet. Um jamal and became a part of his seed collective
[31:23.520 --> 31:24.560]  and
[31:24.560 --> 31:29.600]  You know, I can go back say, you know, my experience with the plant is over 30 years
[31:30.560 --> 31:33.060]  Um have a lot of experience in equatorial
[31:33.920 --> 31:39.040]  So I did a 10 years in around the equator and that type of 13th of royman breeding for a long time
[31:39.600 --> 31:41.600]  about 10 years of that
[31:41.840 --> 31:50.080]  And then migrated here about 25 years ago 20 something years ago. And um my first experience with indoors here was
[31:51.200 --> 31:56.320]  It taking a trip to colorado to visit some friends and that's where I saw the car that
[31:57.040 --> 31:59.140]  You know back then they say came from connecticut
[31:59.920 --> 32:06.980]  Um, I saw williams wonder. It's a big skunk. I know these amazing plants grown indoor in colorado
[32:08.000 --> 32:13.600]  Which was amazing and then I came back to the bay area because I had traveled to colorado from the bay area
[32:14.800 --> 32:16.720]  Came back to the bay area
[32:16.720 --> 32:17.840]  and um
[32:17.840 --> 32:18.800]  kind of
[32:18.800 --> 32:20.800]  started my little indoor venture and
[32:21.360 --> 32:23.120]  You know started out with
[32:23.120 --> 32:24.560]  super skunk
[32:24.640 --> 32:26.240]  Ultra skunk
[32:26.240 --> 32:31.120]  And when I had rosenthal straight cow max 49, which I thought was cool back then
[32:31.760 --> 32:35.040]  you know, and then my experience just grew from there on with
[32:36.640 --> 32:38.640]  With you know, um
[32:38.720 --> 32:43.600]  having getting that cough over from colorado out here and produce it for a long time for the
[32:44.400 --> 32:50.180]  The cannabis dispensaries or the what you will refer to back then as uh medical dispensaries
[32:50.660 --> 32:52.660]  Right
[32:52.660 --> 32:59.000]  And I had a good experience with some of the older strains like the chem dogs the ramelan the california oranges
[33:00.180 --> 33:03.220]  Calio that takes forever. Did you grow calio as well?
[33:03.860 --> 33:09.540]  Yeah, I grew calio. I grew calio, uh in like eartha 20 years ago 21. Yeah
[33:10.340 --> 33:13.860]  How many weeks was the calio that you were growing? Was it like a 16?
[33:15.460 --> 33:17.540]  No, it was it was a indica short
[33:18.420 --> 33:20.420]  Flower
[33:22.660 --> 33:24.740]  Yeah, I have friends that grew a calio that was
[33:25.620 --> 33:28.980]  16 to 18 and one of my friends he took it he's
[33:29.620 --> 33:35.380]  He since passed but he took him 20 weeks and it was amazing stuff, but it would take forever
[33:36.180 --> 33:37.780]  Yeah
[33:37.780 --> 33:40.360]  Well, yeah, there's some great various strains. You mentioned romulan
[33:41.220 --> 33:45.060]  Uh, you know, I think there was a bunch of them around that time
[33:45.460 --> 33:47.700]  You know, we were starting to get european stuff as well
[33:48.340 --> 33:51.780]  Um, you know power plant we were seeing power plant in the bay area
[33:52.500 --> 33:54.500]  Super silver haze stuff like that
[33:55.220 --> 33:56.180]  Yeah
[33:56.180 --> 33:58.500]  Yeah, yeah super silver was you know
[33:58.500 --> 34:03.140]  We did the super silver when we could not get the cough the cough was an excellent plant
[34:03.220 --> 34:05.780]  I mean nl5 haze if you flower it to 10
[34:06.260 --> 34:11.080]  And then when we flower well, we would call it the cough because it's a whole different experience
[34:11.400 --> 34:12.520]  Um
[34:12.520 --> 34:17.720]  you know and having those experience with those plants and and and losing those plants and
[34:18.200 --> 34:21.800]  And thinking that i'm just gonna go back to the club and grab a calio cut
[34:22.760 --> 34:24.760]  You know, so I let them go
[34:24.920 --> 34:29.880]  For a while and I went back and grabbed the cuts again and realized that oh there's different things going on here
[34:29.880 --> 34:31.880]  It's a whole different cut. It's not all the same
[34:32.600 --> 34:37.800]  You know and losing the romulan and losing the calio and a couple of the different chem dogs and stuff. Um
[34:38.280 --> 34:43.160]  That was where I decided to start holding on to stuff and that's you know, I went to the urkel
[34:44.360 --> 34:48.600]  I held on to that florida og because I those things I had got from
[34:49.160 --> 34:53.560]  From the hemp center that was you know, I don't want to be name dropping here, but you know, sure
[34:54.520 --> 34:58.760]  Turner and those guys used to work at the same facility that I grew for
[35:00.120 --> 35:02.120]  Um, so I had you know
[35:02.680 --> 35:05.880]  I was growing the cough and some morning glory for them at that time
[35:06.280 --> 35:12.840]  They had uh offered me these trains and that's how I ended up with that florida og which I understand is the
[35:13.560 --> 35:15.560]  one of the parents of the cookies
[35:15.800 --> 35:19.320]  and um, and that's how I ended up with the urkel and
[35:20.120 --> 35:26.840]  You know, and then you know, my mango is pretty unique. I had that since like 2006. It's a cut of a mango
[35:27.800 --> 35:31.560]  That's not circulated. Um, I think it's an old kc brain
[35:31.800 --> 35:33.800]  I think it's an old kc brain
[35:34.600 --> 35:37.480]  You know, there's an old hippie dude up in um, mando
[35:38.520 --> 35:44.440]  that um, we used to get pounds of it from he wouldn't give us a clone, but in that pound we found a seed and
[35:45.160 --> 35:47.160]  you know grew that out and that's the
[35:47.480 --> 35:49.800]  cuts of that have been keeping ever since and
[35:50.920 --> 35:53.560]  Tied was just as good as what we were getting from him back then
[35:54.200 --> 35:56.600]  Um, yeah, it's time to move forward
[35:57.320 --> 36:02.620]  And they seen the urkels and then you know the cherry pie and then I kept the cherry pie the urkel
[36:04.120 --> 36:11.000]  Uh the mango and that florida og and those kind of has kind of been the basis of a lot of the breeding that I do
[36:11.160 --> 36:13.320]  Trying to get those into seed forms
[36:13.880 --> 36:18.760]  Back then so I did a lot of back crossing of them, you know, I started to sell them recently
[36:19.720 --> 36:20.600]  and
[36:20.600 --> 36:27.240]  Yeah, it's just been a journey and you know had had a case in san francisco the same time and rosenthal has his case here
[36:27.800 --> 36:30.760]  I had some experience working for jack harrow for a while
[36:31.560 --> 36:32.680]  um
[36:32.680 --> 36:41.640]  and also, um, you know, um did a demonstration in golden gate park planting 2001 cannabis plant as a part of a
[36:41.860 --> 36:43.560]  demonstration on the tv
[36:43.560 --> 36:45.960]  police police personnel the news
[36:46.680 --> 36:49.880]  so, you know been here for a while kind of contributing to
[36:50.600 --> 36:54.760]  Doing my part, you know to the freedom and the liberation of the plant itself
[36:55.800 --> 36:58.920]  Um, and that's always been one of my passion
[37:00.200 --> 37:01.960]  and you know
[37:01.960 --> 37:08.520]  Moving forward work my way into the regulated space and not having so much fun with it at all, but i'm here
[37:09.800 --> 37:11.800]  and um
[37:11.800 --> 37:16.200]  Um, what else can I touch on and i've gathered a lot of strains over the years
[37:16.440 --> 37:20.600]  Like, you know, I have family all over the world especially in africa and um
[37:21.800 --> 37:28.760]  And stuff so I keep getting most of the most of my what I would call land races or what people refer to as land races
[37:29.240 --> 37:30.760]  um, I
[37:30.760 --> 37:33.560]  my experience with them is is that I try to
[37:34.440 --> 37:38.760]  Get them from source from family who have been who understands them
[37:39.320 --> 37:44.280]  You know because you know, everybody could get some stuff from swazi and say oh I got swazi. Oh I got but
[37:44.840 --> 37:51.560]  You know, they're not they're not what the people in swazi are smoking or they're not what the people in central america or colombia or even
[37:51.620 --> 37:53.160]  mexico like
[37:53.160 --> 37:56.280]  like I for instance the show you did on and on the
[37:57.320 --> 38:01.160]  Live from mexico and they talk about how the narco stuff only makes it here
[38:01.480 --> 38:06.600]  And then that real small batch stuff gets shared around the corners here of those countries. Um,
[38:07.480 --> 38:13.800]  So i'm kind of very reserved to grab a lot of the stuff that we see online when it comes to land races and stuff
[38:14.520 --> 38:18.680]  Um, because a lot of them are not very appealing to me from my experience. Um
[38:19.640 --> 38:24.600]  With with equatorial straight. There are some really good ones. I mean it's yet sure
[38:25.720 --> 38:27.320]  It's yet to
[38:27.320 --> 38:30.360]  Being here for 25 years. I've experienced some really great herb
[38:31.000 --> 38:33.880]  um, but you know, I could say the same for
[38:34.760 --> 38:41.000]  For for you know, the equatorial the ones to have experienced some really great herb, you know, if I smoke
[38:41.400 --> 38:47.720]  If we smoke that herb the way we smoke herb here you're sleeping by five o'clock in the afternoon you're done for the day
[38:48.280 --> 38:50.760]  so someone said bless orange hill and uh
[38:51.800 --> 38:56.520]  Orange hill is from jamaica. I don't know if you've ever had the orange hill, but that stuff will knock your ass out
[38:56.680 --> 39:02.440]  It's but it's it's unique flavor profile super strong some of the strongest weed i've ever smoked in my life
[39:03.080 --> 39:05.080]  um
[39:05.400 --> 39:07.000]  From the highland
[39:07.000 --> 39:13.160]  North central america area so i've i've experienced like what bodyy talks about but what he talks about
[39:13.800 --> 39:17.400]  So from from like it's about guatemala and those area
[39:18.040 --> 39:22.280]  and i've experienced those things and um, you know, those are pretty unique and
[39:23.560 --> 39:27.800]  And the diversity man. I mean it seems like within
[39:30.760 --> 39:33.640]  All of these countries there's a certain
[39:34.500 --> 39:39.880]  Population or a certain part of the society that really deals with herb on a level where
[39:41.320 --> 39:45.880]  You know can be compared to the same way we appreciate it here and look at it here
[39:46.920 --> 39:54.120]  yeah, and I think on that note we can talk a little bit about europe and I think that there's a big misconception on
[39:54.420 --> 39:56.200]  equatorial varieties
[39:56.200 --> 40:02.120]  Being terpenoly and limonene dominant that are just that haze what I think a lot of people know is haze flavor
[40:02.760 --> 40:04.760]  Like with the train wreck
[40:04.920 --> 40:11.800]  Stuff like that. There's a lemon meringue train wreck all these things that have that are heavy dominant with the terpenoly and limonene
[40:12.280 --> 40:14.760]  And you know, that's from bottlenecking. That's not actual
[40:15.540 --> 40:19.080]  expression of the true diversity of these genetics that come from
[40:19.640 --> 40:25.580]  The equatorial, you know, I mean even going into some of the tropical stuff that gets but I would say the equatorial
[40:26.600 --> 40:29.800]  You know, there's this depression that's gone on and most people in the world
[40:30.280 --> 40:32.280]  If you go to europe if you go to
[40:33.000 --> 40:36.680]  The united states or other countries when they think of equatorial they think of haze
[40:37.560 --> 40:41.980]  And haze is part of it. Definitely. You know, that's an expression like the colombian
[40:42.520 --> 40:47.240]  Definitely has that it's it's heavy with the terpenoly and limonene, but that's not all there is
[40:48.120 --> 40:51.480]  And so, you know having gordon on here this kind of ties it all in together
[40:51.560 --> 40:56.120]  but you know the genetic diversity when we start bottlenecking we get stuck with
[40:56.760 --> 41:02.360]  A small population and very little diversity when there's so much stuff to be able to work with and to be able to
[41:02.840 --> 41:04.840]  Use as medicine and other things like that
[41:05.400 --> 41:07.640]  So do one of you guys want to touch on that?
[41:11.760 --> 41:13.840]  As far as uh
[41:13.840 --> 41:19.840]  As far as the difference. Well, I I do agree with what you're saying when it comes to sativas. Um, it's not
[41:20.960 --> 41:26.320]  strictly limonene and and and uh jack turps that everybody would refer to um
[41:27.280 --> 41:31.600]  I have my experience with them is that they could be pretty floral
[41:32.240 --> 41:38.640]  And you know and like for instance, you look at a strain like the durban itself the pure durban
[41:39.200 --> 41:40.480]  um
[41:40.480 --> 41:47.200]  There's some licorice and some anise and some mild floral tones going on in those genetics and you know, they're outside of
[41:47.840 --> 41:54.000]  Outside of the lemonene regular earthy smelling and those are the ones I try to get away from
[41:54.560 --> 41:55.760]  um
[41:55.760 --> 42:01.200]  As far as you know, they're very common and I have a lot of friends that read sativas as well
[42:01.760 --> 42:05.600]  but you know, those are not the sativas that i'm focused on as far as
[42:06.160 --> 42:10.160]  For breeding purposes. They're they're they do have a lot of good medicine
[42:11.040 --> 42:14.980]  um, we cross a gelato with an angola black by a colombian
[42:16.160 --> 42:22.160]  Well angola red colombian black and you know, and there was stuff coming out of there with 13 percent
[42:22.640 --> 42:24.080]  THC
[42:24.080 --> 42:29.680]  uh six percent cbd at six, I mean 13 percent cbd six percent, uh,
[42:30.320 --> 42:33.200]  Uh thc like two to ones and stuff like that
[42:33.760 --> 42:40.320]  But there were some interesting, you know, a lot of medicinal properties within them and and they breed dominant for those properties as well
[42:40.400 --> 42:42.400]  from what I see, um
[42:42.480 --> 42:45.840]  You know when you have a 24 25 percent
[42:46.960 --> 42:48.960]  phenia hit it with a
[42:49.280 --> 42:51.280]  with one of those, uh
[42:51.920 --> 42:56.720]  Land race type or equatorial type what you end up with is it not to thc?
[42:57.520 --> 42:58.640]  sometimes
[42:58.640 --> 43:00.800]  two to one cbd to thc or
[43:01.360 --> 43:03.040]  in those
[43:03.040 --> 43:04.480]  Progeny, so
[43:04.480 --> 43:08.480]  I do agree. They have great medicinal properties as far as all the other
[43:09.040 --> 43:12.080]  Kind of noise that we don't really focus on these days
[43:13.840 --> 43:15.680]  Sure
[43:15.680 --> 43:21.440]  Yeah, there's tons of stuff that isn't being focused on and and even more stuff that's in such small
[43:22.320 --> 43:23.340]  uh
[43:23.340 --> 43:25.520]  Amounts in a plant that unless you're using
[43:26.320 --> 43:29.840]  Lab equipment you wouldn't even be able to identify it and I think there's you know
[43:29.920 --> 43:33.600]  I think we're just scratching the surface of what's possible with medicine
[43:34.160 --> 43:36.400]  you know as far as drug discovery and everything else and
[43:36.800 --> 43:41.040]  We're gonna find we're not gonna find that in the populations of stuff. We already have we're gonna find that in
[43:41.840 --> 43:45.040]  uh, the outcrosses that occur over time or or
[43:45.760 --> 43:49.140]  Uh, you know some of the heirloom or maybe even feral genetics
[43:50.240 --> 43:51.440]  um
[43:51.440 --> 43:53.840]  You know the feral just stuff is pretty much going away
[43:53.840 --> 43:58.960]  But but there's it still exists out there same thing with the land races. I mean I hear people saying the land races are gone
[43:58.960 --> 44:00.400]  It's not true
[44:00.400 --> 44:05.360]  You know people have hybridized versions and they're not completely gone. There's people they're stewards
[44:05.360 --> 44:07.120]  there's people like gordon and
[44:07.120 --> 44:13.200]  The other guys on the show that are stewards of the plant that have been saving stuff for years. I have a seed collection
[44:14.000 --> 44:18.960]  And i've always said something like the value of a seed is in its use and not in its possession
[44:19.600 --> 44:23.520]  But it's it's a combination of stuff if you're not going to use it. It's worth nothing
[44:24.320 --> 44:25.920]  you know, so
[44:25.920 --> 44:27.840]  uh, I guess
[44:27.840 --> 44:34.240]  You know you want to talk a little bit about land races jamal and the difference between land race feral and I know
[44:34.640 --> 44:37.920]  We've had this conversation before so I think sure sure. So I mean
[44:38.540 --> 44:40.540]  essentially my
[44:41.020 --> 44:45.420]  My take on it is that a feral plant is one that has
[44:46.540 --> 44:48.460]  very little to no
[44:48.460 --> 44:49.960]  human
[44:49.960 --> 44:51.960]  interaction with it or human
[44:52.380 --> 44:53.500]  um
[44:53.500 --> 44:58.140]  Watering of sorts what i've what i've read or what i've heard is that there's common
[44:58.780 --> 45:01.420]  feral plants that are on the perimeters of
[45:02.200 --> 45:03.180]  commercial
[45:03.180 --> 45:05.180]  um, I guess would be hemp
[45:05.500 --> 45:11.180]  And that the feral stuff kind of would be on on the side and just kind of is able to survive what they call consider
[45:11.740 --> 45:14.060]  Ditchweed and then an heirloom would be
[45:14.780 --> 45:16.700]  um
[45:16.700 --> 45:20.320]  A genetic that has is is in a specific location
[45:21.260 --> 45:26.960]  That location is usually isolated and that population is not being mixed with other populations
[45:27.980 --> 45:31.680]  And so year after year people are growing a specific cultivar
[45:32.560 --> 45:36.080]  And they're self-pollinating and just continuing with that genetic
[45:36.960 --> 45:38.160]  uh
[45:38.160 --> 45:42.500]  you know for us as a group like we kind of debate regarding
[45:43.840 --> 45:45.120]  or
[45:45.120 --> 45:52.720]  I often debate regarding if all genetics are worth saving and if all if all cultivars are worth crossing with
[45:53.440 --> 45:54.240]  um
[45:54.240 --> 45:59.620]  Some genetics are really rough and the amount of work that you have to do to bring it to something commercial
[46:00.100 --> 46:05.780]  Is quite a bit of work there are other cultivars that are a little bit closer to you know
[46:05.940 --> 46:07.940]  Our needs or what we might be looking for
[46:09.060 --> 46:10.260]  um
[46:10.260 --> 46:15.640]  And so that's that's a lot of what kind of we debate or talk about is, you know, which particular
[46:16.660 --> 46:23.460]  Which particular heirlooms are worth preserving, you know, that's that's my main thing because you know, we can't just preserve them all
[46:23.860 --> 46:26.420]  We don't have that amount of time. And so it's really about
[46:27.360 --> 46:30.740]  Pinpointing specific traits that we're looking to
[46:31.540 --> 46:33.700]  to move from one genetic into another
[46:34.420 --> 46:38.280]  and finding those specific traits in genetics
[46:38.900 --> 46:42.020]  And you know looking into it further in that way and you know
[46:42.020 --> 46:46.280]  Like the more you really try to do it properly it gets to be a little bit overwhelming
[46:46.740 --> 46:49.620]  and that's kind of why the group is so cool is that we're able to
[46:50.500 --> 46:52.500]  Pick different things and share them with each other
[46:53.380 --> 46:56.900]  Yeah, yeah, no, I think that's cool you guys have an amazing group
[46:58.020 --> 47:00.340]  Uh, gordon and I are gonna have to stop by one of these days
[47:01.460 --> 47:03.460]  Oh, yeah
[47:03.540 --> 47:09.060]  What's cool is it's it's uh, you know, the meetings are on on zoom and so hello, you know
[47:09.060 --> 47:11.940]  And so we'll definitely have to stop by on zoom one of these days
[47:12.020 --> 47:17.940]  yeah, and you know the conversations that we have are are really interesting and pretty dorky at times, but
[47:18.100 --> 47:23.860]  It's it's very similar to these podcasts it's just kind of like a deeper dive into these particular subjects
[47:24.500 --> 47:26.260]  It's awesome
[47:26.260 --> 47:28.900]  Yeah, I can dork out on those conversations for sure. Uh,
[47:29.620 --> 47:31.620]  Yeah
[47:31.860 --> 47:33.380]  for sure
[47:33.380 --> 47:39.380]  Yeah, it is it is uh, it is kind of dorky, but if it's something that you're interested in, uh, then it's really engaging
[47:40.260 --> 47:41.780]  You know
[47:41.780 --> 47:45.140]  And one thing one thing that I I wanted to wanted to share was
[47:45.220 --> 47:49.620]  Just when you're talking about like, um, typically people think that they're uh,
[47:50.420 --> 47:56.020]  That their heirloom genetics are going to be a specific terpene profile. I have three different things here
[47:56.020 --> 47:58.900]  They're all completely different smellings. So here's the punta roja
[47:59.620 --> 48:06.100]  And initially it smells like you're drinking from a juice box or that you're sucking in the air from a juice box
[48:07.220 --> 48:12.420]  Um, and then as it dries and as it cures it really starts to change to something
[48:12.420 --> 48:19.380]  Really starts to change this something something a little bit more complex. The other one which is from steve is the
[48:20.260 --> 48:21.220]  red
[48:21.220 --> 48:25.080]  excuse me, this is the uh, red panama red by congolese
[48:25.860 --> 48:27.460]  and
[48:27.460 --> 48:30.020]  I get a little bit of grass from this one
[48:30.820 --> 48:32.180]  um
[48:32.180 --> 48:33.380]  and
[48:33.380 --> 48:40.020]  I find that the ones that actually have the most grassy terpene profile, which a lot of people don't really like
[48:40.660 --> 48:44.420]  I find have the best high so it's kind of this fight between
[48:45.140 --> 48:48.660]  Things that are really tasty and kind of sleepy and things that really
[48:49.300 --> 48:50.740]  Get you going
[48:50.740 --> 48:54.980]  But have this kind of grassy not as ideal flavor to them
[48:55.540 --> 48:58.260]  And then the last one is this super larfy
[48:58.880 --> 49:01.700]  Burmese and you would totally assume
[49:02.500 --> 49:03.700]  that
[49:03.700 --> 49:05.700]  This would be some
[49:06.340 --> 49:08.340]  Not good cannabis
[49:08.500 --> 49:10.500]  But it's actually
[49:10.800 --> 49:12.800]  extremely strong
[49:12.900 --> 49:14.900]  very grassy flavored
[49:15.060 --> 49:19.380]  and for me the most interesting part about this is you really get to feel what
[49:20.260 --> 49:23.780]  Cannabis feels like without the indica influence onto it
[49:25.220 --> 49:29.060]  Which is you know, not something that we commonly get a chance to experience
[49:30.340 --> 49:31.860]  Nice
[49:31.860 --> 49:36.900]  That's awesome. I would love to experience those. That's that's great. I got some weed to trade for sure, too
[49:37.860 --> 49:39.060]  um
[49:39.060 --> 49:41.700]  But yeah, so I wanted to talk today a little bit about sour diesel
[49:41.700 --> 49:45.540]  That's something that's very close to my heart and gordon and I had a conversation about the other day
[49:45.620 --> 49:49.940]  And I know it's something that's close to his heart as well. And he's done a lot of work with
[49:50.580 --> 49:51.940]  sour
[49:51.940 --> 49:55.860]  so gordon, you want to tell us a little bit about your history with sour diesel and
[49:56.340 --> 49:58.900]  Kind of the the work you've done with sour over the years
[50:00.020 --> 50:02.020]  uh, yeah, so uh
[50:02.500 --> 50:05.780]  Sour diesel, uh, I mean is is one that i've been
[50:07.060 --> 50:09.060]  Been cultivating here
[50:09.300 --> 50:11.300]  Yeah over 15 years now
[50:11.620 --> 50:13.380]  um
[50:13.380 --> 50:18.260]  Uh originally a cut that we got from some friends out in mendo
[50:19.220 --> 50:21.220]  um, and I
[50:22.500 --> 50:24.500]  used um
[50:25.780 --> 50:27.780]  I uh
[50:28.660 --> 50:36.580]  Well, I I started uh, I started all this off, you know at that at that time, uh, I was primarily growing
[50:37.380 --> 50:39.380]  uh some og
[50:39.780 --> 50:45.620]  and uh some sour and so I had a garden in which it was only those two
[50:46.580 --> 50:48.580]  and uh
[50:49.620 --> 50:52.340]  And so there was a
[50:53.300 --> 50:54.420]  uh
[50:54.420 --> 51:00.440]  You know sour, uh would sometimes express that, uh hermaphroditic tendency
[51:01.300 --> 51:04.260]  and uh, and so we
[51:05.220 --> 51:09.780]  Uh came across a little bit of bag seed in the trimming process
[51:10.500 --> 51:12.500]  and uh
[51:12.880 --> 51:16.900]  Interestingly, uh, so the the bag seed that we came across was from some og
[51:17.780 --> 51:19.540]  um
[51:19.540 --> 51:20.820]  and
[51:20.820 --> 51:24.340]  Amazingly enough. I got a male seed
[51:26.980 --> 51:31.540]  In that process there was you know a small handful and uh, I
[51:31.860 --> 51:34.420]  I germinated them and there was a singular male
[51:35.220 --> 51:37.220]  um
[51:37.220 --> 51:45.140]  and so that was uh, then I took that and uh, and
[51:46.020 --> 51:47.380]  started
[51:47.380 --> 51:49.380]  uh
[51:49.460 --> 51:54.260]  With that male I did a pollination again of that sour and that og
[51:55.220 --> 51:57.060]  and uh
[51:57.060 --> 52:03.700]  And then I took the resultant seeds from that cross and I started a
[52:05.040 --> 52:07.040]  population outcrossing
[52:07.060 --> 52:09.060]  Program that went through
[52:09.540 --> 52:11.540]  So I did four generations
[52:12.340 --> 52:14.340]  of population outcrossing
[52:15.060 --> 52:16.340]  um
[52:16.340 --> 52:20.900]  before I did any kind of uh
[52:22.260 --> 52:24.980]  You know any kind of selection, uh at all
[52:25.940 --> 52:33.720]  And so and typically those were in populations of between like two and probably 400
[52:34.660 --> 52:36.420]  uh
[52:36.420 --> 52:43.220]  You know, uh individual phenotypes between you know in in each uh population outcross
[52:44.740 --> 52:46.340]  Um
[52:46.340 --> 52:48.260]  so
[52:48.260 --> 52:53.140]  Then subsequently from there i've i've gone, you know, I I've done
[52:53.780 --> 52:58.020]  Uh some some selections within that line
[52:58.740 --> 53:00.740]  um and
[53:01.780 --> 53:06.420]  Really, uh when it comes to anything that i'm
[53:08.340 --> 53:13.300]  Using as a pollen source on any breeding that i'm doing at this point in time
[53:14.260 --> 53:16.580]  Somewhere back in that lineage
[53:17.220 --> 53:19.220]  Uh, unless it's something
[53:19.460 --> 53:21.940]  totally new to me, uh, but
[53:22.900 --> 53:30.740]  Even still at this point like everything has uh some of that in there. Uh, so
[53:31.940 --> 53:33.460]  um
[53:33.460 --> 53:34.660]  but
[53:34.660 --> 53:37.860]  I guess in the the population outcrossing side of it
[53:38.820 --> 53:42.740]  One of the reasons that I chose to to go that way, you know, uh
[53:43.860 --> 53:45.860]  you know, there's like
[53:46.080 --> 53:50.600]  stability and uh increasing, uh, the genetic diversity
[53:51.160 --> 53:55.800]  Uh within the gene pool, but it's also like there's an aspect of it where I think about it of just kind of
[53:57.240 --> 54:05.240]  You know opening up this treasure trove, you know, you're you're you're opening the the doors to see all these aspects of
[54:06.040 --> 54:08.040]  potential
[54:09.240 --> 54:11.400]  And so what
[54:12.680 --> 54:15.560]  You know what I have found in the process of doing that
[54:16.360 --> 54:18.360]  uh are
[54:18.440 --> 54:19.560]  uh
[54:19.560 --> 54:24.200]  You know terpene profiles or morphological expressions like all these different
[54:25.320 --> 54:27.080]  uh attributes
[54:27.080 --> 54:32.600]  That if I were to show you this particular, you know phenotype you would never guess
[54:33.240 --> 54:38.280]  Uh that that comes out of a line that is just sour and og
[54:40.920 --> 54:42.920]  And
[54:43.400 --> 54:45.400]  You know, I think that that's uh
[54:45.400 --> 54:49.960]  I think that that's a a really important
[54:50.680 --> 54:56.280]  uh aspect of all of these, you know, all of these plant lines and and seeds that are
[54:57.320 --> 54:58.280]  you know
[54:58.280 --> 55:01.800]  the the that we care about that we have relationships that we are
[55:02.760 --> 55:05.660]  You know, we're we're engaged in like a symbiosis
[55:07.000 --> 55:08.360]  and
[55:08.360 --> 55:10.360]  um
[55:10.360 --> 55:14.760]  You know and as that applies to like, you know the seed market or the
[55:15.400 --> 55:19.000]  flower market like commercial viability like that's really only
[55:19.960 --> 55:21.800]  one aspect
[55:21.800 --> 55:23.320]  uh
[55:23.320 --> 55:29.580]  Of of that relationship and it's not it's not even necessarily an essential aspect of that relationship
[55:30.520 --> 55:32.520]  um, and
[55:32.840 --> 55:34.120]  uh
[55:34.120 --> 55:36.120]  You know, I I think that
[55:36.280 --> 55:38.520]  You know particularly when you're talking about
[55:39.240 --> 55:44.460]  Uh global heirlooms or land-raised varietals
[55:47.320 --> 55:50.700]  You know a lot of those seed lines have been preserved
[55:51.800 --> 55:54.600]  without that consideration even
[55:55.860 --> 55:58.360]  Necessarily being part of the equation at all
[55:59.240 --> 56:00.600]  um
[56:00.600 --> 56:02.600]  and and so
[56:02.680 --> 56:08.440]  You know, I think that it's important to keep that in perspective is that the you know, the commercial market is really just one
[56:09.960 --> 56:11.960]  It's one lens to look through
[56:12.840 --> 56:14.040]  um
[56:14.040 --> 56:20.520]  You know, but when you're you know talking about like grassy profiles or super larfy structure
[56:21.240 --> 56:23.240]  um
[56:23.240 --> 56:27.640]  You know, uh, yeah in in in terms of the the
[56:28.440 --> 56:31.240]  you know when when looking through the lens of uh,
[56:32.120 --> 56:34.120]  Of commercialization
[56:34.280 --> 56:39.720]  Those things look totally undesirable. But if you put on maybe some different lenses, uh
[56:41.000 --> 56:43.720]  Then all of a sudden what you're looking at. Uh
[56:44.840 --> 56:48.920]  Is something that you know can become very valuable to you?
[56:49.560 --> 56:53.960]  uh, perhaps not in an economic sense, um, but
[56:55.400 --> 57:00.680]  You know, uh, but that I mean that that potential exists there too. Uh
[57:01.720 --> 57:06.760]  You know, I don't know how many breeders were selecting for high cbd content 20 years ago
[57:07.400 --> 57:08.840]  um
[57:08.840 --> 57:10.360]  but
[57:10.360 --> 57:14.360]  seriously all of a sudden all of a sudden that uh that became
[57:15.320 --> 57:18.840]  a whole nother uh commercial market and so
[57:19.880 --> 57:25.240]  uh, you know, I think that that just kind of underscores a general point that I would make which is that
[57:26.520 --> 57:29.080]  You know, we're just kind of like walking along on the road
[57:29.640 --> 57:36.780]  Uh with these with these plants and we don't really know where we're going necessarily
[57:37.800 --> 57:38.920]  um
[57:38.920 --> 57:39.960]  but
[57:39.960 --> 57:42.280]  We know that just as it has taken
[57:42.840 --> 57:44.840]  uh countless generations
[57:45.160 --> 57:47.320]  of ancestors before us
[57:48.040 --> 57:51.000]  For us to be walking along that road. The same is true
[57:51.560 --> 57:54.440]  For the cannabis that is walking along that road with us
[57:55.080 --> 57:56.440]  and
[57:56.440 --> 57:59.640]  Uh, and based on that relationship we should be doing
[58:00.600 --> 58:02.680]  Our best to take good care of each other
[58:03.640 --> 58:04.840]  um
[58:04.840 --> 58:06.840]  and
[58:07.240 --> 58:11.480]  I think, you know, we're all here because uh, we know
[58:13.640 --> 58:17.080]  How important and significant cannabis has been in our lives
[58:18.280 --> 58:22.760]  And uh, so to the extent that we value her in that way
[58:23.480 --> 58:24.440]  uh
[58:24.440 --> 58:25.480]  we
[58:25.480 --> 58:27.480]  should also
[58:27.480 --> 58:29.480]  strive to be
[58:29.540 --> 58:31.320]  um
[58:31.320 --> 58:35.320]  supportive and important, uh in her life, too
[58:37.400 --> 58:41.250]  For sure
[58:41.490 --> 58:44.050]  I think I don't know if that was much about the sour diesel, but
[58:44.690 --> 58:48.690]  Yeah, well, no, and I think that's the beauty of the show is we can kind of go off in a direction
[58:48.690 --> 58:50.770]  We can start with one thing and go off in a direction
[58:51.490 --> 58:53.170]  uh
[58:53.170 --> 58:58.530]  that enlightens or opens people's mind up to the possibilities of other things because
[58:59.730 --> 59:06.930]  Such a little bit, you know, there's very little information about the plant that's shared. We get excited about gelatos these days and
[59:07.650 --> 59:10.450]  cookies and gelatos and these commercial brands that
[59:11.330 --> 59:14.530]  Not that they don't mean a lot, but they mean a lot to some people
[59:15.090 --> 59:18.610]  But in the grander scheme of things cannabis is so much of a bigger thing
[59:19.170 --> 59:22.370]  You know that that we've grown along through the past
[59:23.170 --> 59:29.010]  You know as long as humans have been alive on this earth with their cannabis has been alive and you know evolving together
[59:29.890 --> 59:31.010]  um
[59:31.010 --> 59:32.850]  So, yeah
[59:32.850 --> 59:37.570]  So guys, let's see. What else should we talk about jamal? I know there's some other interesting cool stuff
[59:38.210 --> 59:40.210]  That you want to share
[59:41.970 --> 59:44.290]  Yeah, you know I I would just love I mean
[59:45.490 --> 59:51.490]  From last from last year's interview. I got two amazing. I got many amazing members
[59:52.450 --> 59:55.730]  And you know, I just thought it was really awesome that
[59:56.450 --> 59:59.490]  You know people that watch this show were able to connect
[01:00:00.130 --> 01:00:01.410]  and
[01:00:01.410 --> 01:00:02.370]  um
[01:00:02.370 --> 01:00:04.370]  You know continue this journey
[01:00:04.770 --> 01:00:08.610]  And so like, you know, if if steve is interested i'd love for him to you know
[01:00:08.610 --> 01:00:11.330]  Talk about some of the varieties that he's grown this year
[01:00:12.130 --> 01:00:16.050]  There are a lot of things that people in the community talk about growing but don't
[01:00:16.690 --> 01:00:18.530]  often grow
[01:00:18.530 --> 01:00:19.490]  um
[01:00:19.490 --> 01:00:22.610]  i've grown some of his or um one of his
[01:00:23.810 --> 01:00:26.130]  I guess it was an f1 from snow high
[01:00:26.610 --> 01:00:31.090]  But it was my first time growing I guess what you consider like a true f1 hybrid
[01:00:31.890 --> 01:00:35.250]  And it was the what nangarhar by panama red
[01:00:35.970 --> 01:00:37.010]  and
[01:00:37.010 --> 01:00:40.470]  It was really um a very different experience
[01:00:41.250 --> 01:00:43.010]  than
[01:00:43.010 --> 01:00:48.370]  Most of my experiences growing cannabis. Um, what was different about it was that it had an amazing veg
[01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:51.090]  It had an amazing amazing structure
[01:00:52.050 --> 01:00:56.690]  but um, this is actually something that me and steve have gone back and forth about
[01:00:57.330 --> 01:01:01.330]  But for me it kind of fluffed out in this really like loose
[01:01:01.970 --> 01:01:03.250]  loose way
[01:01:03.250 --> 01:01:05.010]  um
[01:01:05.010 --> 01:01:07.410]  But at the same time the terpenes on it I would just
[01:01:08.530 --> 01:01:12.210]  Argue they were like kind of raw. How would you describe this steve?
[01:01:12.210 --> 01:01:14.290]  I mean, I think people really get a kick out of that
[01:01:14.930 --> 01:01:18.690]  Yeah, I mean it was a really interesting plant and it was it's
[01:01:19.410 --> 01:01:25.170]  To me to describe it. It's almost like just a giant afghani like the panama influenced this
[01:01:25.790 --> 01:01:27.810]  afghani, so it was just
[01:01:27.810 --> 01:01:31.730]  Like a 15 foot tall indica plant. It was just amazing
[01:01:32.290 --> 01:01:34.290]  and yeah, the
[01:01:34.530 --> 01:01:39.570]  In flower I was getting a lot of perfumey chocolatey aroma
[01:01:40.370 --> 01:01:44.930]  Which was really interesting it didn't really carry through to the cure
[01:01:45.730 --> 01:01:48.370]  um kind of lost a lot of that in the cure, it's
[01:01:49.650 --> 01:01:51.650]  that that was one of the plants that
[01:01:52.370 --> 01:01:58.770]  Got some powdery mildew and I believe that you know, that's the afghani influence on on the sativa
[01:01:58.770 --> 01:02:02.610]  That was one of them that had afghani in it and sure enough. It got pm
[01:02:03.650 --> 01:02:09.250]  Whereas the same mother on other plants did did not do that or say father did not do that
[01:02:10.290 --> 01:02:11.890]  um
[01:02:11.890 --> 01:02:13.570]  a lot of what i'm
[01:02:13.570 --> 01:02:15.570]  looking for and buying or
[01:02:16.690 --> 01:02:21.650]  Kind of searching through these lines is for that psychedelic more
[01:02:23.790 --> 01:02:28.210]  Motivational type of high i'm actually breeding for the high which I find
[01:02:28.850 --> 01:02:34.470]  It's kind of hard to do and I don't hear it discussed a whole lot because especially with a lot of these sativas
[01:02:35.010 --> 01:02:38.690]  I don't feel like the high really develops until a really good cure
[01:02:39.330 --> 01:02:45.090]  And i'm talking six to six weeks to two months is where really i'm feeling the power come out
[01:02:45.570 --> 01:02:47.570]  in some of these and it's really easy to just
[01:02:48.190 --> 01:02:50.050]  Discount them as weak
[01:02:50.050 --> 01:02:52.290]  Before that and toss them away
[01:02:53.330 --> 01:02:55.330]  so, um
[01:02:55.810 --> 01:02:56.770]  Just
[01:02:56.770 --> 01:02:57.730]  as
[01:02:57.730 --> 01:03:04.610]  A musician type artist person that that's what i'm looking for something to motivate me and that's what i'm missing in a lot of
[01:03:05.490 --> 01:03:13.490]  Strains in the last 20 years is something that gets me off the couch and actually puts a lot of creativity into my brain and
[01:03:14.370 --> 01:03:17.570]  These strains do it and i've proven it, you know this year
[01:03:18.530 --> 01:03:20.530]  been my most creative year ever and
[01:03:21.650 --> 01:03:28.290]  and something that i'm really exploring more is trying to hone in on how to
[01:03:29.710 --> 01:03:31.710]  Selectively breed for the high
[01:03:32.430 --> 01:03:34.430]  And i'm finding
[01:03:34.510 --> 01:03:36.510]  A lot of it's really easy to say these are heady
[01:03:36.990 --> 01:03:41.650]  but um, there's more to it than that and I I do think there's something like ghcv
[01:03:42.750 --> 01:03:44.750]  That could be influencing
[01:03:44.750 --> 01:03:49.230]  What i'm looking for and that's that's what why i'm looking in the panama reds
[01:03:49.870 --> 01:03:50.910]  um
[01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:52.190]  I've
[01:03:52.190 --> 01:03:55.810]  Just heard a lot of that that they've tested for high and ghcv
[01:03:56.990 --> 01:04:00.910]  I and when I find what i'm i'll have it tested and see if I can prove that but
[01:04:01.790 --> 01:04:06.350]  I'm i'm searching and a lot of those, you know, really narrow leaf. Um
[01:04:08.010 --> 01:04:10.990]  Varieties because that's kind of what I grew up with I remember
[01:04:11.790 --> 01:04:14.830]  smoking thai stick and alcapulco rolled
[01:04:15.550 --> 01:04:17.790]  in the early 80s and it was
[01:04:18.670 --> 01:04:22.510]  Really powerful weed and and psychedelic like close to mushrooms
[01:04:23.230 --> 01:04:26.030]  And in the years since we've hybridized things
[01:04:27.070 --> 01:04:31.150]  I think the afghani influence has taken over that part of the the high
[01:04:32.030 --> 01:04:33.230]  and
[01:04:33.230 --> 01:04:36.930]  That's why i'm trying to look more and just pure sativas
[01:04:37.630 --> 01:04:39.150]  and breed with
[01:04:39.150 --> 01:04:41.330]  Nothing, but you know hybridized pure sativas
[01:04:42.190 --> 01:04:43.230]  to
[01:04:43.230 --> 01:04:45.710]  To retain that because it definitely is a different
[01:04:47.470 --> 01:04:53.790]  If you don't give it a chance you might overlook it and if you smoke a sativa and then follow it up with a
[01:04:54.090 --> 01:05:00.990]  Indica because you're not feeling the high you you also might miss it because it's a longer onset sometimes as well
[01:05:02.110 --> 01:05:04.110]  so
[01:05:06.590 --> 01:05:07.870]  Good stuff
[01:05:07.870 --> 01:05:11.870]  well, let's get back to some stuff with uh grasshopper, we haven't heard a lot from him and
[01:05:12.430 --> 01:05:14.430]  I'm sure he's got a lot to share. So
[01:05:14.670 --> 01:05:17.790]  You want to tell us about some of your current breeding projects grasshopper?
[01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:23.240]  Sure, um
[01:05:27.790 --> 01:05:30.350]  I'm always working on some stuff. Um
[01:05:31.310 --> 01:05:37.150]  You know over the past 12 years it seems like you know, I try to do at least three or four out crosses or
[01:05:37.610 --> 01:05:39.610]  preservations every year
[01:05:39.790 --> 01:05:40.910]  um
[01:05:40.910 --> 01:05:43.390]  and um last year my focus was
[01:05:44.510 --> 01:05:46.190]  on uh
[01:05:46.190 --> 01:05:50.910]  A 1987 goby from the goby desert. We started the goby
[01:05:51.790 --> 01:05:53.070]  and um
[01:05:53.070 --> 01:05:54.350]  another
[01:05:54.350 --> 01:05:57.390]  heirloom that i've been focused on with a heirloom that uh
[01:05:58.350 --> 01:06:00.750]  A relative of mine had collected in hawaii
[01:06:02.410 --> 01:06:05.150]  In 2013 I kept those around for a while
[01:06:06.110 --> 01:06:07.550]  and um
[01:06:07.550 --> 01:06:12.350]  Finally popped them four or five years ago and was totally amazed by those
[01:06:12.750 --> 01:06:16.670]  So I just been breeding those back and forth bouncing different things off of them
[01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:23.550]  To see, you know if they pass the traits on that I like or the traits that you know is attractive to me
[01:06:24.350 --> 01:06:25.550]  um
[01:06:25.550 --> 01:06:28.030]  And I find out that they are passing on those traits
[01:06:28.990 --> 01:06:30.990]  uh the goby as well, um
[01:06:32.190 --> 01:06:34.190]  How the goby came about was
[01:06:35.130 --> 01:06:37.130]  87
[01:06:37.390 --> 01:06:39.550]  A military dude had that strain
[01:06:40.510 --> 01:06:43.390]  He brought like three or four seeds back with him from
[01:06:44.110 --> 01:06:49.550]  Some parts of india, but the seeds according to him they came from the goby
[01:06:50.750 --> 01:06:52.750]  in the in that area, um
[01:06:53.150 --> 01:06:55.150]  And they're pretty impressive i've grown some
[01:06:56.990 --> 01:07:05.550]  Some mazar and different afghanis and different things and from that region and um, these things are kind of the most impressive i've seen so far
[01:07:06.430 --> 01:07:08.430]  when it comes to
[01:07:09.690 --> 01:07:11.470]  Heirloom type
[01:07:11.470 --> 01:07:17.710]  So i'm really happy with those i'm looking forward to continue working with those and probably releasing them at some point
[01:07:18.350 --> 01:07:19.550]  and um
[01:07:19.550 --> 01:07:22.590]  You know besides that I have the regular my regular
[01:07:23.390 --> 01:07:29.630]  Herum with just about six to eight strains that I would bounce a lot of things off of every time i'm doing a
[01:07:30.330 --> 01:07:36.270]  uh a preservation or an open pollination, I would draw a herculane, draw some ojis, some mangoes, some cherries
[01:07:37.390 --> 01:07:42.290]  And then during um, like last year what I did was open pollinated the hawaiian
[01:07:43.790 --> 01:07:48.110]  And then um selected the best two males and the best two females from those
[01:07:48.670 --> 01:07:51.150]  And I was getting out of the hawaiians i'm getting like
[01:07:52.350 --> 01:07:58.270]  Like mango carrot i'm getting some like ripe guava. I mean, they're pretty pretty unique
[01:07:59.230 --> 01:08:02.510]  so, uh, and those are the kind of arrows that i'm
[01:08:03.370 --> 01:08:07.870]  Attracted to as opposed to the more terpenoline and more, you know, earthy
[01:08:08.890 --> 01:08:10.830]  limonene, uh
[01:08:10.830 --> 01:08:13.310]  So, you know, those are what i've been working on
[01:08:14.190 --> 01:08:16.190]  um
[01:08:16.830 --> 01:08:19.070]  And um last year I also did a
[01:08:19.850 --> 01:08:25.790]  82 Durban preservation. I had a couple thousands of those seeds for some for a couple years and
[01:08:26.510 --> 01:08:32.030]  Had to get into those and open them up and those were interesting as well. I see licorice phenols. I see
[01:08:33.150 --> 01:08:35.150]  I see um
[01:08:35.390 --> 01:08:41.310]  Uh, some anise phenols in there and this is a this line I got it from
[01:08:41.790 --> 01:08:48.110]  His brother mendel some years ago and he he is the edwards and uh edwards and uh, um
[01:08:49.390 --> 01:08:56.510]  82 Durban from what i'm understanding. That's the one they took over to europe and crafted the super silver and they made the poison
[01:08:57.390 --> 01:09:03.070]  Um, so it's like it doesn't really have any indica influencing in it. It's it's a it's a wispy
[01:09:04.030 --> 01:09:06.030]  not very large buds, but
[01:09:06.830 --> 01:09:08.830]  Very very high therapy
[01:09:09.550 --> 01:09:13.950]  Um, so those are what i've been working on crossing the Durban's out crossing them, um
[01:09:14.990 --> 01:09:19.150]  and and different things and of course I do a lot of the runs by Durban's and
[01:09:20.030 --> 01:09:21.710]  runs by hawaiian
[01:09:21.710 --> 01:09:25.390]  Purples by hawaiians and you know right now i'm focusing on the gobi
[01:09:26.110 --> 01:09:29.390]  This year i'm focusing on um pulling up the gobi
[01:09:29.870 --> 01:09:36.510]  I you know, I had photos of it that we were trying to get ready to show today, but unfortunately it didn't work out but
[01:09:37.310 --> 01:09:39.470]  You know with my experience growing um
[01:09:42.030 --> 01:09:49.390]  Land races or what we are heirlooms those have been the most attractive for me like I you know, um
[01:09:50.270 --> 01:09:56.510]  I have a lot of other stuff that's from the source like for instance, um, the cindy dolls I have some
[01:09:57.230 --> 01:10:03.790]  Some uh malawi some swazi that my family they collect from those places and send to me but you know
[01:10:03.790 --> 01:10:05.790]  Um everything takes time and
[01:10:06.430 --> 01:10:08.430]  So I just kind of keep them
[01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:13.950]  Tough away. I might be going off tangent a little bit here. But uh, yeah, I have friends in like germany who
[01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:16.510]  Who called me asking about?
[01:10:16.830 --> 01:10:21.150]  Specific strains from senegal and certain region in senegal because they're discovering
[01:10:21.870 --> 01:10:27.070]  T-a-c-t and that's one of their focus right now is this tetra cannabis trial
[01:10:28.110 --> 01:10:29.310]  There's something like that
[01:10:30.190 --> 01:10:35.870]  So there's a lot of cool stuff that I would like to look at and see what what's in store and what what is
[01:10:36.510 --> 01:10:38.510]  What's the components within them?
[01:10:38.910 --> 01:10:40.910]  um
[01:10:41.390 --> 01:10:42.750]  Yeah, um
[01:10:42.750 --> 01:10:49.790]  Breeding goya is always something it's hard to say specific because i'm all over with it. Um, I breed just about
[01:10:51.470 --> 01:10:56.990]  You know a lot of open pollination a lot of the a lot of what we call the exotics because those kind of
[01:10:57.310 --> 01:10:59.310]  You know move a little bit faster than
[01:11:00.270 --> 01:11:03.390]  than the then some of the land races and stuff
[01:11:04.110 --> 01:11:05.470]  but um
[01:11:05.470 --> 01:11:07.470]  Yeah, there's a lot of cool lines over the years
[01:11:08.190 --> 01:11:10.430]  and those have been my focus recently though is
[01:11:11.150 --> 01:11:15.710]  The hanale which is the hawaiian the goby i'm really excited about that
[01:11:15.710 --> 01:11:18.670]  I'm getting like some sulfur and garlic and some kind of
[01:11:19.230 --> 01:11:21.150]  come from from that
[01:11:21.150 --> 01:11:22.270]  um
[01:11:22.270 --> 01:11:23.870]  very very unique
[01:11:23.870 --> 01:11:25.710]  um plant
[01:11:25.790 --> 01:11:27.790]  um, they
[01:11:28.270 --> 01:11:30.270]  Like for instance the goby finishes
[01:11:30.910 --> 01:11:33.790]  End of september and it tests up to like 26
[01:11:34.830 --> 01:11:39.710]  It's a mad indica. I've never grown an indica like that. Um, and it's veg pretty good
[01:11:40.830 --> 01:11:46.750]  Um, so i'm doing like the goby onto the erco the goby onto the og i'll try to craft the goby
[01:11:48.750 --> 01:11:50.750]  With my ogbx
[01:11:50.910 --> 01:11:58.750]  You know atg 13 og og and then back into ogbx2 by goby and those were pretty impressive plans
[01:11:59.230 --> 01:12:00.510]  um
[01:12:00.510 --> 01:12:02.510]  really like
[01:12:02.830 --> 01:12:07.310]  Did some amazing things to the coach side of it. Um, very similar
[01:12:08.110 --> 01:12:09.550]  And yeah
[01:12:09.550 --> 01:12:12.430]  That that's that's kind of where i'm at with the breeding projects these days
[01:12:13.310 --> 01:12:14.750]  nice
[01:12:14.750 --> 01:12:17.950]  So I want to talk about something that's going on in the chat and you know
[01:12:17.950 --> 01:12:22.270]  Because we're all a little bit older i'm in my 40s. I'm in mid 40s as a freaking
[01:12:23.150 --> 01:12:25.170]  two weeks from now i'll be 45
[01:12:26.110 --> 01:12:27.470]  but uh
[01:12:27.470 --> 01:12:33.710]  skunk and cat piss and some of these varieties that we got to experience when we are younger are gone
[01:12:34.190 --> 01:12:38.350]  And I keep hearing seed companies have it. I've got the road killer. I've got the skunk
[01:12:38.990 --> 01:12:40.990]  The you know, the the skunk
[01:12:41.550 --> 01:12:44.990]  One is definitely not skunk that we know as super skunky
[01:12:45.790 --> 01:12:46.750]  um
[01:12:46.750 --> 01:12:50.590]  Although it's it's great in its own sense skunk number one has been used for a lot of stuff
[01:12:51.390 --> 01:12:57.710]  What happened to the the real skunk skunk we can call it roadkill. We can call it whatever but you know, uh
[01:12:58.910 --> 01:13:05.870]  Back at shows in the day. You got a freaking dead shows shakedown street. You'd smell that skunk like a mile away. You'd smell it
[01:13:07.070 --> 01:13:09.070]  It was super intense
[01:13:09.150 --> 01:13:10.750]  super amazing
[01:13:10.750 --> 01:13:13.310]  very acquired taste because it smelled straight up like
[01:13:13.950 --> 01:13:16.270]  The freaking skunk like a skunk had been sprayed
[01:13:16.750 --> 01:13:22.030]  Um, you know and it wasn't like gas like fuel like chemi it was skunk like skunky
[01:13:22.670 --> 01:13:25.310]  And that's been gone for a long time. What do you guys think?
[01:13:26.090 --> 01:13:27.310]  happened
[01:13:27.310 --> 01:13:28.430]  um
[01:13:28.430 --> 01:13:31.710]  We can start with steve. I think yeah
[01:13:32.750 --> 01:13:36.670]  Well, definitely I I smoked skunk for the first time in 81 and it was still
[01:13:38.190 --> 01:13:42.670]  Probably the strongest best weed i've ever smoked. I'll never forget that high
[01:13:43.310 --> 01:13:47.950]  So ever since then i've been looking for it and I have never found that one again
[01:13:48.670 --> 01:13:50.670]  I it's been skunky
[01:13:50.990 --> 01:13:54.510]  Yeah, um, and I grew up near santa cruz
[01:13:55.390 --> 01:13:56.910]  and I would
[01:13:56.910 --> 01:13:59.710]  From 78 to 81. I would smell skunk
[01:14:00.510 --> 01:14:03.070]  Anytime I was driving in the hills. So
[01:14:04.510 --> 01:14:07.710]  And i'm i'm pretty sure that wasn't a skunk every time
[01:14:08.670 --> 01:14:09.790]  Right
[01:14:09.790 --> 01:14:16.270]  Absolutely as things went indoors. I think I mean I know so many people that got popped for for smell
[01:14:16.910 --> 01:14:18.110]  so
[01:14:18.110 --> 01:14:21.310]  once you've got a fruity strain or something else that
[01:14:22.350 --> 01:14:23.950]  That would sell
[01:14:23.950 --> 01:14:26.590]  That didn't get you busted. It was no
[01:14:27.310 --> 01:14:29.310]  That's no decision to make at all. So
[01:14:29.950 --> 01:14:33.550]  I mean hopefully people held on to the seeds, but i've never seen them again
[01:14:33.630 --> 01:14:38.430]  And actually back in those days when I was smoking that skunk I never found one seed in that stuff so
[01:14:39.790 --> 01:14:44.750]  I just think and as fruity strains became popular. They were just wow i've never
[01:14:45.710 --> 01:14:49.390]  Tasted anything like blueberry and weed and it became like this thing
[01:14:50.030 --> 01:14:52.030]  Where a lot of people didn't look back
[01:14:52.590 --> 01:14:58.510]  And it wasn't until a decade or so later that people started going. Wow. I wish I had skunk again, you know
[01:14:59.150 --> 01:15:03.950]  Right and then by this time it was like well, where is it and everyone keeps on claiming it
[01:15:04.670 --> 01:15:07.550]  the first time I was at those dead shows too I was in
[01:15:08.430 --> 01:15:10.430]  and I went to a lot of shows from
[01:15:10.750 --> 01:15:13.150]  late 80s to till the end and
[01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:16.190]  I watched
[01:15:16.190 --> 01:15:22.830]  That chem pop up in the parking lot too, and it was close to the skunk but not quite you know one
[01:15:23.470 --> 01:15:24.510]  and
[01:15:24.510 --> 01:15:26.190]  as that
[01:15:26.190 --> 01:15:28.270]  Chem took over I and og
[01:15:29.390 --> 01:15:31.790]  That was all over the lot everywhere in the 90s
[01:15:32.270 --> 01:15:39.150]  Right, and I started seeing less and less like organ purple tie and kind bud, you know that kind of stuff. So
[01:15:39.790 --> 01:15:43.470]  Totally, I just I just think indoor growing has a lot to do with it
[01:15:44.750 --> 01:15:46.750]  Yeah, for sure
[01:15:48.510 --> 01:15:52.590]  Let's see, how about a grasshopper what's your thought on it?
[01:15:53.390 --> 01:15:59.470]  Well, I I think I came around a little bit too late I I guess I missed out on the on the skunk train
[01:16:00.270 --> 01:16:07.950]  Yeah, my experience is that I had done a lot of the senses the senses skunk like the ultra the super and the skunk one
[01:16:09.150 --> 01:16:14.030]  And I my experience with it was it would there was there were a type of more sweeter
[01:16:14.910 --> 01:16:16.910]  As opposed to skunky
[01:16:17.870 --> 01:16:25.710]  As I get a train but you know growing the senses skunks by that time I get it, you know that stuff has already been
[01:16:26.830 --> 01:16:28.830]  Yeah, the sensei skunk was all sweet
[01:16:29.230 --> 01:16:34.830]  The very sweet notes and and the skunk that I experienced from all the european companies was the sweet stuff
[01:16:35.470 --> 01:16:36.990]  Yeah, that's my
[01:16:36.990 --> 01:16:42.280]  I I I wasn't here in the 80s that um was killed
[01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:44.520]  By
[01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:48.600]  We'll get to jamal last because he's the youngest gordon, what do you have to say about skunk?
[01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:57.880]  Well, uh, yeah, I I came around a little bit later than that too, I guess uh, I wasn't uh,
[01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:07.720]  I wasn't smoking flowers in the 80s. Um, because I was mostly under 10 for that decade. So, um,
[01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:11.080]  The uh
[01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:17.160]  But like where do I think it went? Yeah, I mean I think uh, I think that the uh,
[01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:23.960]  You know the indoor thing. Uh, yeah, I I I could see that being a huge influence on it
[01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:26.200]  um
[01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:28.200]  and
[01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:32.200]  You know, I mean it's it's it's one of those
[01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:34.440]  uh
[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:36.440]  it's one of those things that for
[01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:43.320]  For whatever reason at the time the people who were holding on to it
[01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:48.440]  Either chose to go with something different, you know
[01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:54.440]  Something you know for whatever consideration like oh it does better indoors or you know
[01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:57.400]  This is what my people want or you know, however
[01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:00.680]  that uh that storyline went
[01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:03.400]  and
[01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:05.800]  It's one of those things that
[01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:12.440]  You know, I guess ties in a little bit earlier with uh, the the comment I think uh,
[01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:16.040]  You know that uh
[01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:23.000]  That well, let's see there was I guess one thing I wanted to tie into was
[01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:27.480]  uh, what grasshopper was saying earlier about the
[01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:29.800]  the
[01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:35.980]  Personal relationships in the in the maintenance of you know, these different land race varieties
[01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:38.920]  Um
[01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:40.920]  and I guess also what
[01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:44.120]  you know jamal was saying about trying to
[01:18:45.060 --> 01:18:46.360]  understand
[01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:51.100]  Uh, if all of these different heirlooms or land races need preservation
[01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:54.280]  um
[01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:56.520]  Because
[01:18:57.320 --> 01:18:59.560]  You know, I mean we could we could easily be
[01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:02.120]  you know, uh
[01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:05.000]  30 years in the future looking back on the time now
[01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:07.240]  and
[01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:09.240]  you know wondering where
[01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:13.000]  You know, I mean even just now looking back. It's like yeah
[01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:17.560]  we could you know, we could talk about the skunk or the catfish or any number of strains that like
[01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:19.880]  we don't
[01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:23.240]  Know of them around anymore. Haven't seen them in years or decades
[01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:25.400]  uh
[01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:27.480]  Is like
[01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:30.440]  You know, we don't we don't always necessarily know
[01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:32.120]  uh
[01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:35.880]  You know what the future holds as far as what we consider
[01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:37.940]  uh
[01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:41.960]  desirable or valuable and uh, so just
[01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:43.960]  you know
[01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:50.120]  I guess as we're as we're taking care of the seeds is like, you know, keeping that uh that perspective
[01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:55.560]  Of course there are limitations to how much any uh of us as individuals can do
[01:19:56.200 --> 01:20:02.040]  Um, but that's I mean one thing I I I really appreciate uh what jamal's got going on down there
[01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:03.560]  um
[01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:07.960]  And you know, we've engaged in this, uh in a lot of ways
[01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:12.280]  Uh outside of the cannabis sphere in in in other crop types
[01:20:12.760 --> 01:20:14.440]  uh is
[01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:16.120]  like
[01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:17.320]  you know, we
[01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:24.520]  Operate like a seed preservation farm here. Um, but the scope of seed preservation is
[01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:31.720]  It I mean it's it's just massive like it's huge. Uh, it's not something that you could do
[01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:34.280]  with any like
[01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:40.120]  small group of people or in any singular location, uh, you know, like
[01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:48.760]  When we're looking at all this diversity of like whether you know, whether it's equatorial stuff or whether it's
[01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:53.880]  uh, central asian stuff or south asian or southeast asia, it's like
[01:20:55.800 --> 01:20:57.240]  That
[01:20:57.240 --> 01:20:59.240]  like
[01:20:59.320 --> 01:21:05.080]  You know all of those places also need to be engaged in taking care
[01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:07.960]  You know of their seed
[01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:09.000]  uh
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:10.440]  like
[01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:13.400]  You know if we are growing out
[01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:18.620]  Uh equatorial varieties here in california
[01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:21.480]  uh
[01:21:21.480 --> 01:21:23.480]  Well, it's different
[01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:26.280]  We just made it different already. We haven't even
[01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:32.840]  You know, like we we haven't even harvested any seed or anything yet and like it's already different
[01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:35.640]  because
[01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:42.920]  It's a different environment where we're at a different latitude we have different, you know, it doesn't rain in the summer here
[01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:46.120]  uh, you know, there's all these different things so it's like
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:48.600]  uh
[01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:50.600]  Sure, that's that's one
[01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:58.460]  I I guess one thing that I would just emphasize in that is that it's like it's none of it is static
[01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:00.680]  uh
[01:22:00.680 --> 01:22:01.640]  and
[01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:05.400]  You know, it's it's it's moving all the time and I I guess
[01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:08.600]  Yeah, again, I can't really speak to
[01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:16.280]  What happened to the skunk particularly as like as far as like, how did it actually go down?
[01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:18.760]  uh, but I think what we can
[01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:21.720]  sort of surmise at this point is that
[01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:24.600]  It slipped through our fingers
[01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:26.680]  you know
[01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:31.800]  Like it wasn't anything that I ever held in my hands personally it wasn't you know
[01:22:32.420 --> 01:22:38.040]  Literally my fingers but like for us as cannabis growers and stewards
[01:22:38.680 --> 01:22:39.640]  uh
[01:22:39.640 --> 01:22:43.080]  You know collectively. Yeah, it slipped through our fingers and and it is
[01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:46.360]  Far from the only one. I mean, oh god, I
[01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:53.640]  You know, I mean i'm sure everybody on here has got plenty of stories about stuff that they were trying to keep
[01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:56.200]  That got away from them
[01:22:56.280 --> 01:22:58.760]  uh, you know and that is
[01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:03.000]  Part of the nature of the thing. Uh
[01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:08.680]  You know, and and I mean I guess you know for myself in a certain regard. I don't uh
[01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:16.060]  I don't know that that's uh cataclysmic, you know, there are uh forces at work that I might not necessarily understand
[01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:22.200]  uh for you know, uh, or it might just be user error, you know, uh,
[01:23:22.600 --> 01:23:25.000]  That whole spectrum of possibilities open as well
[01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:27.560]  um
[01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:29.080]  But
[01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:31.080]  uh
[01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:35.480]  You know, I I think it just emphasizes the point of
[01:23:36.520 --> 01:23:38.520]  uh
[01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:40.280]  You know
[01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:44.360]  it's easy to imagine being in the future and looking back and being like
[01:23:45.480 --> 01:23:47.480]  man, you know in
[01:23:48.260 --> 01:23:49.860]  whatever
[01:23:49.860 --> 01:23:55.380]  2021 here. It's like we were all about the gelato and the cookies and all this kind of other stuff
[01:23:56.420 --> 01:23:58.180]  but
[01:23:58.180 --> 01:24:00.180]  you know if that's
[01:24:01.460 --> 01:24:09.620]  You know if that's all that we're left with in another 30 50 100 years, uh, then we missed the point
[01:24:10.580 --> 01:24:11.780]  uh
[01:24:11.780 --> 01:24:15.300]  and I think we you know, I think we dropped the plot of the of the
[01:24:15.940 --> 01:24:17.940]  story and we
[01:24:17.940 --> 01:24:19.220]  so
[01:24:19.300 --> 01:24:21.220]  uh
[01:24:21.220 --> 01:24:23.460]  You know trying to hold on to those things
[01:24:24.420 --> 01:24:29.140]  And not just in that like, oh i've got some old skunk seeds in the freezer or something
[01:24:29.220 --> 01:24:31.620]  i'm, pretty sure that's what they are, but no like
[01:24:32.260 --> 01:24:38.260]  uh, like in in situ in situation like in in active use, uh
[01:24:39.220 --> 01:24:45.540]  and I guess i'll just tie that up back to that, uh point that grasshopper was making earlier is that it's like
[01:24:46.980 --> 01:24:48.980]  These are family relationships
[01:24:49.540 --> 01:24:50.580]  uh
[01:24:50.580 --> 01:24:52.580]  you know, this is
[01:24:52.660 --> 01:24:54.660]  you know, like these are uh
[01:24:56.740 --> 01:24:59.460]  You know, I mean every one of us, you know
[01:25:00.900 --> 01:25:06.100]  For everybody that's eaten today, uh, which is all of us. Uh, we all have seed to thank for that
[01:25:06.820 --> 01:25:08.740]  um
[01:25:08.740 --> 01:25:10.500]  So
[01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:12.500]  like
[01:25:12.740 --> 01:25:15.700]  Our ability and uh attention
[01:25:16.500 --> 01:25:19.380]  Uh to caring for the seeds that are in our lives
[01:25:20.020 --> 01:25:21.620]  is uh
[01:25:21.620 --> 01:25:24.420]  it's really important because it is that easy for stuff to
[01:25:25.860 --> 01:25:30.260]  You know, it's it's it's just not around anymore. Um
[01:25:33.220 --> 01:25:40.660]  Yeah, but I also but I would also say in that that I think uh that with time and attention
[01:25:41.940 --> 01:25:44.680]  And uh, you know a lot of work and some generations
[01:25:45.700 --> 01:25:48.020]  Uh, you could find your way back
[01:25:49.220 --> 01:25:50.660]  um
[01:25:50.660 --> 01:25:52.660]  you know, you could find your way back to
[01:25:53.220 --> 01:25:55.220]  to those ones and
[01:25:55.940 --> 01:25:58.980]  It might not be exactly how you remembered it
[01:26:00.180 --> 01:26:04.020]  But probably most of the 80s aren't exactly how you remember them either. So
[01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:06.420]  Absolutely
[01:26:06.420 --> 01:26:11.460]  Yeah, it's funny because I think a lot of people think and there's some people that have never experienced gunk and are like well
[01:26:11.460 --> 01:26:15.620]  It's just like chem and it's like well, I think it comes from the same place like a thio
[01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:19.320]  You know because dials are kind of like terpenes. They're smaller molecules
[01:26:20.100 --> 01:26:22.580]  that give you that pissy ammonia or
[01:26:23.300 --> 01:26:25.700]  the the burnt rubber or those
[01:26:26.420 --> 01:26:29.380]  Uh, you know fuel-y kind of smells but skunk
[01:26:29.940 --> 01:26:35.140]  Was in my recollection skunk, you know, and my memory could be lying to me, but I I absolutely
[01:26:35.700 --> 01:26:37.940]  remember skunk growing up and when I was a
[01:26:38.420 --> 01:26:41.460]  You know 14 50 was before I even have a driver's license my friend
[01:26:42.180 --> 01:26:46.980]  Would drive maybe I was 16, but I didn't have a driver's license then but we used to drive down to santa cruz
[01:26:46.980 --> 01:26:52.420]  And we paid 60 straight up and they called it strawberry, but there was no strawberry about it
[01:26:52.500 --> 01:26:56.820]  It was straight skunk and it was called strawberry because the nugs were strawberry sized nuggets
[01:26:57.220 --> 01:27:00.100]  So you'd get three in a bag and they were all strawberry shaped
[01:27:00.820 --> 01:27:04.820]  But it was the skunkiest skunk stuff. You could smell it was so strong and it just
[01:27:05.460 --> 01:27:06.420]  We couldn't get enough of it
[01:27:06.420 --> 01:27:10.740]  so whatever we could get together whether it was an eighth or whether it was 120 bucks or
[01:27:11.140 --> 01:27:14.580]  or enough for an ounce even we've we used to go down there and get
[01:27:15.140 --> 01:27:17.140]  this amazing bud but
[01:27:17.300 --> 01:27:18.260]  man
[01:27:18.260 --> 01:27:22.900]  It's it's kind of it's it's sad and it's also, you know a challenge, you know
[01:27:22.980 --> 01:27:25.540]  If people want this back, I think it's possible to get it back
[01:27:26.180 --> 01:27:26.740]  but uh
[01:27:26.740 --> 01:27:32.180]  Let's talk about phenotypes because just because you have seeds of something even if the person who had it
[01:27:32.820 --> 01:27:35.160]  Made seeds doesn't mean that it's going to express
[01:27:35.940 --> 01:27:41.220]  Because of recessive traits, it's going to express the way we want it to it's going to do what the plant wants to do
[01:27:41.860 --> 01:27:46.180]  You know, we're not in control of those things. Always we can kind of guide it in a way and hope to get
[01:27:46.980 --> 01:27:48.160]  lucky or
[01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:52.500]  Successful and the more, you know, the plant the more you're going to be able to see but like with skunk
[01:27:52.820 --> 01:27:56.980]  Maybe it's a super recessive trait and I would assume that it is because we don't have it now
[01:27:57.700 --> 01:27:59.700]  What's your take on that jamal?
[01:27:59.940 --> 01:28:04.760]  Since I know you weren't around when the skunk was right. How old are you? You're in your 30s. I'm 39
[01:28:05.300 --> 01:28:07.780]  You're 39. You look young. So that's good
[01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:10.500]  Yeah, no, i've never
[01:28:10.500 --> 01:28:13.140]  I've never smoked skunk or roadkill skunk
[01:28:13.860 --> 01:28:16.020]  um, I mean my take on it is that
[01:28:16.900 --> 01:28:19.300]  these certain terpene profiles are like
[01:28:20.580 --> 01:28:22.500]  pop culture phenomena
[01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:25.080]  And I don't believe that they're in one specific
[01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:31.640]  Cutting that was the roadkill skunk. I believe that there were a certain grouping of genetics that
[01:28:32.280 --> 01:28:37.880]  Were expressing a certain, you know range of terpene profiles maybe similar to now
[01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:40.440]  cookies or gas
[01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:42.120]  um
[01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:46.760]  I mean, I don't know. I mean that's really my take on it. I agree like with large enough populations
[01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:48.600]  It should be back in there
[01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:51.720]  You know, you should be able to find it. It shouldn't like ever be lost
[01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:55.640]  It's just how many seeds you're going to look through to find it
[01:28:56.520 --> 01:28:58.520]  um
[01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:02.920]  and you know like a lot of like seems like to me like what breeding is is like
[01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:07.320]  Like we first we started with our heirlooms. Then we did our
[01:29:08.340 --> 01:29:09.540]  baseline
[01:29:09.540 --> 01:29:16.220]  hybrids and then polyhybrids then complex polyhybrids then these super complex and then more and more complex polyhybrids
[01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:20.840]  so it seems like we're almost trying to like slow it down a little bit or like
[01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:25.640]  Like like bring the genetics a little bit back to what they used to be
[01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:28.120]  um
[01:29:28.120 --> 01:29:29.160]  but
[01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:34.600]  As the more i'm learning this i'm not sure if you really can ever bring it back to where it used to be
[01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:36.600]  But really just moving on another
[01:29:36.820 --> 01:29:38.120]  direction
[01:29:38.120 --> 01:29:39.240]  um
[01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:42.760]  And so I mean that's my vague answer regarding roadkill
[01:29:42.760 --> 01:29:46.840]  I mean, it seems like a lot of people who are scamming claim to have roadkill
[01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:48.820]  i'm
[01:29:48.820 --> 01:29:50.440]  hopeful that
[01:29:50.440 --> 01:29:56.280]  um, the goby that grasshopper has been growing i'm, you know, he's i'm hopeful that that has
[01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000]  some roadkill turps in it, but I mean
[01:30:00.680 --> 01:30:06.200]  You know as somebody who's never experienced it I really hesitate to say that i'm the one that knows where it is
[01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:10.920]  I'll tell you everybody knows the smell because it's a skunk smell
[01:30:11.320 --> 01:30:16.040]  Okay, the smell of skunk it is straight as much as a skunk can be skunk smell. It's that
[01:30:16.600 --> 01:30:19.800]  Almost like nose burning skunk smell that burns your nose
[01:30:20.520 --> 01:30:24.760]  And I haven't smoked that we can breathe for it because we all know what it smells like
[01:30:24.760 --> 01:30:27.480]  so it's just it's going to take time to find something that
[01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:32.840]  Appeases all these old. Yeah, we're who knows how old we're going to be by the time we figure it out
[01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:36.040]  but I think it'll come back around at least something that
[01:30:36.760 --> 01:30:43.240]  Will respectfully be on that level and who knows there could be some hippie that has it stashed away somewhere. You just never know
[01:30:43.880 --> 01:30:47.960]  Yeah, you might be I I think you're right james. It seems like it's a recessive trait
[01:30:47.960 --> 01:30:51.720]  That's why we're having such a hard time. It's one of the reasons I'm
[01:30:52.440 --> 01:30:54.440]  i'm going back to
[01:30:54.840 --> 01:30:56.840]  What I remember right before
[01:30:56.840 --> 01:30:58.840]  I ever tried skunk which was
[01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:00.680]  thai
[01:31:00.680 --> 01:31:02.680]  colombian and mexican
[01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:04.200]  and
[01:31:04.200 --> 01:31:05.400]  trying to
[01:31:05.400 --> 01:31:10.600]  get something similar that I feel like is a background to skunk and then breed with those strengths and
[01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:14.280]  see what comes out of it see if I can find that recessive because
[01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:21.080]  I've tried many different sensi seeds super skunk and different things that were skunky. Like I said, but
[01:31:21.640 --> 01:31:28.280]  That first skunk I ever tried I thought was fake. I thought for sure a skunk had sprayed the plant, you know, it was bad skunk
[01:31:29.460 --> 01:31:31.400]  absolutely
[01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:33.400]  I am can I say something on that?
[01:31:33.880 --> 01:31:35.880]  Sure, i'd love yeah
[01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:43.480]  i'm hopeful as well that you know, we could find some of these older stuff but um from my experience prior to
[01:31:44.440 --> 01:31:46.440]  You know being in this space. Um
[01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:49.720]  It's like there was a there was a war on drugs
[01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:56.460]  And you know, there was like in some regions where i'm from there were programs called operation eradication
[01:31:57.480 --> 01:32:01.400]  You know the you know, there were projects set up to actually eradicate the plant
[01:32:02.040 --> 01:32:03.080]  um
[01:32:03.080 --> 01:32:10.600]  And from my experience with it is that you would have some families that would have some really really unique stuff and you know
[01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:17.320]  In those like in central america is the within is the indigenous and the native that really
[01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:20.760]  You know produce
[01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:22.760]  herb for the rest of the population
[01:32:23.400 --> 01:32:25.400]  and um, you will find out that
[01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:28.440]  you know, there's some years that
[01:32:29.640 --> 01:32:33.960]  For two three four five six years you could go to this one family and you get this
[01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:36.840]  Great herb all the time
[01:32:37.320 --> 01:32:41.400]  Every time and then your operation eradication comes in and
[01:32:42.120 --> 01:32:47.160]  Shut them down bust them wipe them out throw them in jail and then you never see those things again
[01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:50.680]  you know a family had
[01:32:51.720 --> 01:32:55.480]  A lot of my experience with what's happening with some of those things from abroad
[01:32:55.800 --> 01:33:02.920]  Because the war on drugs also didn't affect here. It affect all the baselines of what we need to create what we had here
[01:33:03.640 --> 01:33:04.920]  you know like
[01:33:04.920 --> 01:33:09.480]  You know, you go to columbia and central america out of these places different parts of the world
[01:33:09.960 --> 01:33:14.760]  You know, we were paying them to cut their herb down and to turn them to be christian
[01:33:15.640 --> 01:33:16.600]  um
[01:33:16.600 --> 01:33:19.080]  so it's kind of those things where i've
[01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:26.840]  Seen things that was really great for a long time and those families get shut down and those families have been
[01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:28.840]  like
[01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:33.160]  You know breeding them and steering those things into the direction that they wanted to. Um
[01:33:34.040 --> 01:33:40.360]  Not that i'm saying that they don't exist but I still remain very hopeful because of the war on drugs and what it did not just
[01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:44.440]  the parameters within the united states, but
[01:33:44.980 --> 01:33:49.260]  worldwide, you know and we most of what we have we have imported
[01:33:49.880 --> 01:33:55.720]  In the 70s and the 80s to build what we have and now we're trying to go back to those places to grab the baselines
[01:33:55.720 --> 01:34:00.760]  or the or the original, um, genetics that make up some of the stuff but
[01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:06.360]  Those countries have been totally impacted by the war on drugs worse so than we have here
[01:34:07.160 --> 01:34:11.560]  you know, they were to the point where stuff was about to be eradicated totally and
[01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:18.360]  So that's just my take and I still remain hopeful that you can see some of these things come back around
[01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:25.560]  Yeah, for sure and to all those youngins that think that the weed is the best it's ever been
[01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:30.280]  You know i've been smoking since 91 and there was skunk in 91 92
[01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:37.580]  Early, we had skunk in the early 90s. I haven't seen it since the early 90s, but the weed back then was phenomenal
[01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:41.720]  I would say there's less people growing it. It was more dangerous
[01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:45.240]  And the quality on average was a lot better
[01:34:45.960 --> 01:34:49.480]  I wouldn't say you know the genetics there wasn't the diversity that we have now available
[01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:52.440]  But man, the smoke was good. It was freaking
[01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:56.440]  You know, it made me fall in love with cannabis the cat piss is what made me fall
[01:34:56.740 --> 01:35:00.460]  Absolutely fall in love with cannabis was the cat piss but several varieties
[01:35:01.240 --> 01:35:02.360]  so
[01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:06.600]  If you guys are young and you think the weed is the best it's ever been the weed's been great for a long time
[01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:10.780]  You know, we've we've made it more diverse. We've made it higher than thc
[01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:14.520]  We've done a lot of interesting things with it, but it's it's not
[01:35:15.240 --> 01:35:20.460]  Necessarily the best it's ever been it's uh, you know, it is what it is. It's an evolution
[01:35:21.180 --> 01:35:23.820]  So, yeah, what do you guys think about that?
[01:35:25.180 --> 01:35:28.860]  I'm one of those old guys. I totally agree with you. I mean I
[01:35:29.500 --> 01:35:31.340]  I have friends that work at
[01:35:31.340 --> 01:35:34.700]  dispensaries and they bring me some of the latest greatest and
[01:35:35.820 --> 01:35:40.460]  It looks great. It might even have a good flavor, but it it lacks something
[01:35:41.340 --> 01:35:43.340]  That we had back then
[01:35:43.500 --> 01:35:44.540]  um
[01:35:44.540 --> 01:35:48.140]  The weed was very good back then and like you said in the early 90s
[01:35:48.140 --> 01:35:49.660]  it
[01:35:49.660 --> 01:35:57.180]  When it was illegal to grow you you wanted to grow the best and it just made everyone and you wanted to grow something unique
[01:35:57.260 --> 01:35:59.260]  Too it wasn't all the same
[01:36:00.380 --> 01:36:02.300]  Yeah, I see people saying it's all mids now
[01:36:02.300 --> 01:36:07.260]  That's that's not true because you can go to washington in metric and you can go to house of cultivar and buy their stuff
[01:36:07.740 --> 01:36:09.740]  uh canna organics
[01:36:09.740 --> 01:36:14.700]  uh, there's there's a couple other brands up there, but I would say you can get their stuff and it's
[01:36:15.260 --> 01:36:22.380]  Grown really well and it's amazing and you know, I think that there are places in colorado that have good metric cannabis
[01:36:22.460 --> 01:36:24.120]  there's some in
[01:36:24.120 --> 01:36:26.220]  California, there's a there's a few but I you know
[01:36:26.860 --> 01:36:29.260]  And it's you know, we're slowly coming into this
[01:36:29.900 --> 01:36:31.900]  uh legalization and
[01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:38.460]  Decriminalization and you know, so I I would assume that it's going to get better. It still has the possibility of getting better. Um
[01:36:40.300 --> 01:36:42.300]  You know, what do you just yep
[01:36:43.100 --> 01:36:45.100]  And the more homegrowing
[01:36:45.260 --> 01:36:47.740]  to push the commercial market into
[01:36:48.300 --> 01:36:50.940]  Stepping up their game. I think would help too. I mean
[01:36:52.220 --> 01:36:54.220]  if people start
[01:36:54.540 --> 01:37:00.540]  Seeing what what is not on the market and going in that direction then it'll force them to to
[01:37:01.180 --> 01:37:03.180]  Put something in there that doesn't look
[01:37:03.500 --> 01:37:05.500]  you know like
[01:37:06.220 --> 01:37:10.620]  A lot of the modern stuff looks today. It can be a little bit wispy, you know, right?
[01:37:12.780 --> 01:37:16.540]  Yeah, and I get this all good stuff in mexico amazing stuff in mexico guys
[01:37:17.340 --> 01:37:22.700]  And I remember that catfish too. I remember that strawberry buddy you were talking about too. So yeah, I mean, um
[01:37:23.580 --> 01:37:27.100]  That was phenomenal weed. I I it's hard to find stuff
[01:37:27.820 --> 01:37:30.380]  I don't see anything like that in the dispensaries at all
[01:37:31.100 --> 01:37:33.100]  And and with the stickiness either
[01:37:33.420 --> 01:37:39.500]  It seems like the resin now is a lot drier and those sticky buds that remain sticky for months
[01:37:40.140 --> 01:37:44.000]  That i'm i'm seeing that in more of the hazes and sativas
[01:37:44.700 --> 01:37:50.380]  Yeah, I mean for sure that greasy stuff even sour like when it's real greasy, but I remember stuff that was so greasy
[01:37:50.620 --> 01:37:54.540]  We used to have a test where we'd take it and put it in our thumb and stick it against glass
[01:37:55.260 --> 01:37:58.620]  And that was the test like if it would stick to the glass once you take your thumb off
[01:37:59.020 --> 01:38:02.620]  That was a greasy greasy. Yeah, and and I mean it was like
[01:38:03.260 --> 01:38:07.500]  If it was in a in a bag like it always was back then it would just stick to the I mean
[01:38:08.300 --> 01:38:11.820]  It was sugar-coated bags back then because it was so sticky, you know, yeah
[01:38:12.460 --> 01:38:17.820]  Stick yeah sticky and even the I think the grease is from the turps and then the stickies from the trikes
[01:38:18.780 --> 01:38:24.860]  Yeah, but yeah, but yeah greasy you're right greasy. Yeah, that's a good way of putting it. Yeah. Yeah
[01:38:25.180 --> 01:38:28.060]  But like yeah also sticky. I mean you touch it for a second
[01:38:28.060 --> 01:38:31.820]  You get it all over your hands and then you're rubbing little half miniature hash balls
[01:38:32.460 --> 01:38:34.540]  Yeah rolling a joint was difficult sometimes
[01:38:35.020 --> 01:38:41.420]  Yeah, and I feel like the guys so uh silas he's uh, his instagram is always running dank and he grows living soil
[01:38:41.980 --> 01:38:46.620]  He grows specifically. I haven't talked to him in a little while, but he grows specifically for extract
[01:38:47.260 --> 01:38:50.300]  For making rosin and bubble and rosin and his stuff
[01:38:50.940 --> 01:38:56.700]  I love it so much, but you can you can't roll most of it in joints because it's so sticky and so resinous
[01:38:57.740 --> 01:39:02.220]  Um, you know makes great extract but it's tough and I love the way it looks and smells
[01:39:02.220 --> 01:39:05.180]  I love the way it looks and smells. It's one of those ones where you can't put it down
[01:39:05.180 --> 01:39:07.180]  You got to keep smelling the jar
[01:39:07.420 --> 01:39:12.460]  Uh, but yeah, he does live. It's 100 living soil that he's done and he's you know, phenomenal grower
[01:39:12.860 --> 01:39:17.260]  but he definitely gears it more for stuff to do extract with so
[01:39:18.860 --> 01:39:21.260]  I remember stuff back in the day. That's interesting
[01:39:21.340 --> 01:39:24.620]  I've I tried to extract some of this greasy stuff and it doesn't work as well
[01:39:25.660 --> 01:39:31.500]  Well, it depends. So like there's some of the stuff that is greasy like sour diesel is a great example
[01:39:31.660 --> 01:39:33.180]  it makes
[01:39:33.180 --> 01:39:38.540]  Uh extract that's very very greasy and it doesn't yield nearly like gmo where gmo
[01:39:39.100 --> 01:39:42.940]  has a ton of trichomes and it's not only the size of the trichome heads, but
[01:39:43.660 --> 01:39:48.540]  um, you know the stickiness so it's not quite as sticky as those sour diesel turps
[01:39:48.620 --> 01:39:54.060]  I think because it's so turpy with the sour diesel the true sour that it doesn't make excellent hash
[01:39:54.860 --> 01:39:56.860]  But it makes okay hash
[01:39:57.340 --> 01:40:03.180]  Whereas like something like gmo or some of these other varieties man, they just dump hash and it's it's like so
[01:40:03.820 --> 01:40:10.860]  You know gordon and I were talking about hash varieties, you know, like breeding for hash varieties and that's that's something that's on the horizon for sure
[01:40:12.300 --> 01:40:14.300]  Oh, yeah, definitely
[01:40:15.100 --> 01:40:19.900]  I um, you know, I'm kind of just waiting to jump back in here because I want to uh,
[01:40:21.260 --> 01:40:24.140]  also bring up another idea that uh
[01:40:24.540 --> 01:40:27.260]  Kicks around in my head around the land race
[01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:34.700]  conversation and particularly talking about like people growing at home and
[01:40:35.260 --> 01:40:37.260]  You know one of the things
[01:40:37.580 --> 01:40:41.660]  when you know if you're talking about land race or heirloom is
[01:40:42.460 --> 01:40:45.440]  You know you you have this, you know this population
[01:40:46.300 --> 01:40:47.580]  uh
[01:40:47.580 --> 01:40:52.220]  You know, there's there's a a degree of diversity that exists within
[01:40:52.780 --> 01:40:57.180]  You know any land race or heirloom, uh seed lot, um
[01:40:58.220 --> 01:40:59.820]  You know, you're not
[01:40:59.820 --> 01:41:01.820]  You're not getting this uniform
[01:41:02.060 --> 01:41:05.500]  Uh as if it were an f1 hybrid
[01:41:07.100 --> 01:41:09.100]  um and
[01:41:10.540 --> 01:41:14.540]  So like other like other than uh
[01:41:16.540 --> 01:41:19.020]  You know, then then the fact that we're uh
[01:41:19.980 --> 01:41:21.980]  You know like
[01:41:21.980 --> 01:41:23.340]  I guess what
[01:41:23.340 --> 01:41:29.280]  Makes an heirloom or a land race that beyond that general characteristic
[01:41:31.420 --> 01:41:33.420]  Is that it's something that
[01:41:33.980 --> 01:41:38.700]  Somebody's been taking care of in some place for some period of time
[01:41:39.500 --> 01:41:44.060]  Uh, and so typically we're thinking of these as being old
[01:41:44.620 --> 01:41:45.740]  um
[01:41:45.740 --> 01:41:47.100]  You know, I guess
[01:41:47.100 --> 01:41:51.820]  You know having heirloom, uh as a synonym in there, uh
[01:41:52.860 --> 01:41:57.500]  You know has this like well, this is something that's old and the only way that uh,
[01:41:58.540 --> 01:42:03.900]  You know that we could find something like that is to go look in the past for something that's old
[01:42:04.620 --> 01:42:06.620]  and
[01:42:06.700 --> 01:42:12.640]  Uh, and I think that that is actually like narrows our understanding of the possibility
[01:42:12.800 --> 01:42:14.800]  Um
[01:42:14.800 --> 01:42:20.640]  And so I guess the idea that I have in that is like imagine that you were to create
[01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:23.520]  your own land race
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:28.560]  and that you have your land race that you take care of and that is
[01:42:29.280 --> 01:42:30.400]  uh
[01:42:30.400 --> 01:42:32.400]  You know particular and distinct
[01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:37.680]  uh to you know to to to your place to your farm, uh
[01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:40.320]  to to your
[01:42:40.380 --> 01:42:45.520]  Community who you know whomsoever is involved in uh in the growing of this, uh
[01:42:46.880 --> 01:42:48.880]  of this
[01:42:49.500 --> 01:42:54.640]  Population, um, and I don't know I like is there a
[01:42:55.120 --> 01:43:01.760]  a a technical number of generations that have to go by before you can say that something is a land race or is there
[01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:03.360]  a
[01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:08.720]  Degree of stability that you have to be able to see in the line before you can say it's a land race
[01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:10.400]  Um
[01:43:10.400 --> 01:43:12.880]  I'm, not sure I think that uh
[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:18.480]  You know, maybe somebody specified that I don't have a technical answer for that question
[01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:21.120]  but uh
[01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:24.320]  That is uh
[01:43:26.240 --> 01:43:28.960]  To me the the the possibility of
[01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:36.800]  You know of recreating circumstances like that of of creating uh
[01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:38.000]  Uh
[01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:41.300]  You know, it's it's like i'm just creating tomorrow's
[01:43:42.300 --> 01:43:44.000]  heirlooms
[01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:47.040]  Now i'm creating tomorrow's land races now
[01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:48.560]  and
[01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:51.760]  You know, we are at a point in time where we do
[01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:54.640]  you know, uh
[01:43:54.880 --> 01:43:56.880]  We do have a a collection
[01:43:57.360 --> 01:44:02.400]  That has been amassed from around the world all this stuff has been imported from all these places
[01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:07.140]  Like grasshopper was just saying places where they don't have it there necessarily anymore
[01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:09.840]  uh because of
[01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:14.240]  You know the imperialist world that we live in. Um
[01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:17.600]  So
[01:44:17.600 --> 01:44:19.200]  uh
[01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:23.520]  What are like if if we're folding those things
[01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:29.760]  Uh in from all over the world, which is what we've been doing already
[01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:34.960]  Uh, you know, that's not anything new, uh per se
[01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:37.760]  um
[01:44:37.760 --> 01:44:39.600]  So
[01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:43.120]  You know again if it's like oh, there's there's a certain
[01:44:43.680 --> 01:44:49.600]  There's a certain terpene profile that I really like and so I want to find some things that are like that
[01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:53.200]  and then I want to see what comes out and I want to
[01:44:53.760 --> 01:44:57.600]  you know, I want and I want to be connected with other people who are doing that and
[01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:02.000]  Uh, you know have a
[01:45:03.440 --> 01:45:08.480]  I think it's important to keep a level of interaction in the seed sphere
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000]  Uh
[01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.660]  That isn't that isn't uh commercialized
[01:45:15.680 --> 01:45:19.520]  right, um because that is is very much
[01:45:20.320 --> 01:45:21.600]  where
[01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:23.600]  uh
[01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:25.760]  You know, this is
[01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:30.800]  This is all the scale of all this is so much bigger than any
[01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:39.700]  One person or one place or one community like okay. So we're here in california like okay. That's great california
[01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:46.480]  Uh, how many regions are there? Uh, you know microclimates and all that within california. Oh god, it's
[01:45:47.020 --> 01:45:51.360]  Endless, you know and and and we haven't even left california yet
[01:45:52.080 --> 01:46:00.000]  You know the same is true when you go to oregon the same is true when you go, you know, wherever anywhere, uh, so
[01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:10.960]  I think that keeping that diversity really like churning and spinning, uh is possible and I think that
[01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:14.720]  You know, I mean one of the ways that I uh
[01:46:15.920 --> 01:46:18.640]  Look at the work that i'm doing here is
[01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:26.400]  You know, there there is a uh, uh a seed line that i'm working with that is
[01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:34.080]  Is just kind of like a little bit of everything, uh, it's all in there
[01:46:35.200 --> 01:46:36.320]  um
[01:46:36.320 --> 01:46:38.320]  and I don't
[01:46:38.960 --> 01:46:41.120]  Make selections out of that line
[01:46:41.840 --> 01:46:42.800]  uh
[01:46:42.800 --> 01:46:44.800]  at this point in time at least
[01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:46.240]  you know, uh
[01:46:46.240 --> 01:46:53.200]  I mean I have out of different open population. Uh, uh crosses but like
[01:46:54.960 --> 01:46:56.720]  Um
[01:46:56.720 --> 01:46:58.720]  You know just like
[01:46:59.360 --> 01:47:00.800]  What happens?
[01:47:00.800 --> 01:47:05.120]  You know when you when you allow all of these things to mingle?
[01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:07.520]  uh
[01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:12.960]  You know am I finding traits that I find desirable? Well, I may or may not
[01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:21.760]  Uh, but you know, it's uh, you know, it's kind of this like, uh,
[01:47:23.200 --> 01:47:26.320]  Genesis point, uh where you have
[01:47:28.880 --> 01:47:32.880]  This this seed lot that is just got
[01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:36.560]  Really staggering potential
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:41.920]  Right
[01:47:41.920 --> 01:47:44.580]  Yeah, the the sky is the limit with the potential
[01:47:45.840 --> 01:47:47.840]  Yeah, like you can find
[01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:49.840]  you know, it's it's like if
[01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:57.600]  You've got stuff from all over the world in there and then you have the interaction of stuff from all over the world in there
[01:47:58.720 --> 01:48:00.080]  uh
[01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:01.600]  and
[01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:02.960]  uh
[01:48:02.960 --> 01:48:04.480]  yeah, I mean if if
[01:48:04.480 --> 01:48:06.480]  you know, like you don't you don't
[01:48:06.700 --> 01:48:09.760]  necessarily have to be like a commercial grower to
[01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:13.200]  Uh to have that kind of
[01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:15.520]  uh
[01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:20.080]  a relationship where you're you're maintaining a seed lot that is
[01:48:20.960 --> 01:48:22.960]  um
[01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:26.720]  Is either you know just for you or it is for
[01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:29.600]  you know some
[01:48:30.240 --> 01:48:36.160]  Time eventuality out into the future. Uh, you know, you may or may not even be around
[01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:38.800]  when
[01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:46.320]  You know somebody decides that they want to go looking into uh, you know, what what is in that collection of seeds?
[01:48:47.680 --> 01:48:49.680]  um
[01:48:50.480 --> 01:48:52.480]  Uh, but that
[01:48:52.480 --> 01:48:53.600]  like
[01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:55.760]  everything that we have now comes from
[01:48:56.800 --> 01:49:00.560]  Something somebody doing something like that at some point in time
[01:49:01.840 --> 01:49:03.280]  sure
[01:49:03.280 --> 01:49:08.400]  Absolutely, so I want to touch on one thing at full circle 72 a couple minutes ago said land race
[01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:13.520]  Equals what we perceive is untouched strange actually has been crossed for 4 000 years
[01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:16.800]  That's not necessarily what a land race that would be more feral
[01:49:17.280 --> 01:49:19.840]  You know land race is something that's been taken by
[01:49:20.560 --> 01:49:23.520]  Somebody and adapted for a specific need
[01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:26.400]  Now, I think that's the best way to jamal
[01:49:26.880 --> 01:49:30.000]  Wouldn't what would you you know as far as land race that that's pretty much
[01:49:30.560 --> 01:49:33.840]  You can go to our gordon anywhere in the world you can find some
[01:49:34.480 --> 01:49:39.200]  You know land race for as you go over india. There's varieties that they've been cultivating and and
[01:49:39.740 --> 01:49:42.160]  Harnessing and using for a specific purpose
[01:49:42.880 --> 01:49:46.500]  That they've you know, it's not necessarily something feral that's completely untouched
[01:49:47.920 --> 01:49:54.000]  Yeah, I would argue that there is a difference between a feral cannabis and land race. Absolutely
[01:49:54.160 --> 01:49:56.640]  Um, I like the term point of origin
[01:49:57.440 --> 01:49:59.600]  Um, I mean I believe
[01:50:00.800 --> 01:50:02.800]  because there's many different
[01:50:02.940 --> 01:50:05.760]  Descriptions of this but that a land race is like a
[01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:07.440]  deeper
[01:50:07.440 --> 01:50:09.440]  heirloom, so like heirloom
[01:50:10.320 --> 01:50:14.720]  I believe the the definition was like it needed to be grown in the same place for 100 years
[01:50:15.360 --> 01:50:17.360]  50 I believe okay
[01:50:17.760 --> 01:50:21.680]  50 um, so my understanding is that a land race would be something that
[01:50:22.400 --> 01:50:28.180]  Is acclimatized to a specific location has been grown there for you know for many generations
[01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:31.200]  um, and I mean it also seems like
[01:50:31.680 --> 01:50:39.700]  It's like kind of a thing of like western that like a way of westerners that we would describe other cultures genetics
[01:50:40.560 --> 01:50:42.000]  you know that are
[01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.100]  Quote unquote less more primitive
[01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:45.840]  in a way
[01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:51.600]  um, but I mean really it's just you know genetics that are acclimatized to a specific region and
[01:50:51.680 --> 01:50:54.880]  They've been grown there for a certain amount of time. And so they have
[01:50:55.600 --> 01:51:02.560]  Certain characteristics that are extremely dominant. I mean to me that's really what it comes down to and you know, the main
[01:51:03.200 --> 01:51:05.840]  dominant traits that I usually observe
[01:51:06.640 --> 01:51:08.220]  are vigor
[01:51:08.220 --> 01:51:09.680]  hardiness
[01:51:09.680 --> 01:51:11.680]  um
[01:51:11.760 --> 01:51:13.760]  Really strong root structure
[01:51:14.720 --> 01:51:19.520]  um pest resistance mold resistance just a very tough
[01:51:20.320 --> 01:51:27.680]  Wild plant almost like a like a caveman of a plant so it's a bit rough around the edges, but is really
[01:51:28.560 --> 01:51:30.560]  um, it's
[01:51:30.800 --> 01:51:32.800]  bred to survive
[01:51:33.040 --> 01:51:39.280]  And you know whenever I grow those types of genetics, I always find I have to give them much less attention
[01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000]  much less staking
[01:51:42.060 --> 01:51:43.920]  Fertilizing all of those things there
[01:51:43.920 --> 01:51:50.000]  It's just like a wilder version and like a really good example that I tried to give to people is like for example
[01:51:50.800 --> 01:51:52.240]  apples
[01:51:52.240 --> 01:51:56.480]  You know, you can see a wild apple tree. You can taste a wild apple. They're tinier
[01:51:57.200 --> 01:51:58.080]  um
[01:51:58.080 --> 01:52:04.800]  They're usually not sweet. They're kind of bitter and there's a lot of them and the trees are extremely strong as compared to a
[01:52:05.760 --> 01:52:09.840]  cameo apple or whatever type of apple tree, which you know, um
[01:52:10.720 --> 01:52:14.340]  That you know needs a lot more care for the apples to be successful
[01:52:15.680 --> 01:52:17.680]  Nice
[01:52:17.920 --> 01:52:20.000]  Gordon you want to touch on that at all?
[01:52:21.440 --> 01:52:25.440]  Well, I think yeah, I uh, I I agree with the uh,
[01:52:25.840 --> 01:52:31.680]  The land race definition there and I think that apples are a pretty good
[01:52:32.300 --> 01:52:33.440]  analogy
[01:52:33.440 --> 01:52:35.440]  um
[01:52:35.600 --> 01:52:36.640]  In
[01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:37.840]  their
[01:52:37.840 --> 01:52:44.400]  You know in their like their diversity like apples are so exceptionally diverse. Um
[01:52:46.080 --> 01:52:48.080]  And uh
[01:52:50.960 --> 01:52:57.280]  Yeah, I guess the the the point in which you know where I was really going with that is like uh
[01:52:59.200 --> 01:53:02.580]  You know like start your own land race basically
[01:53:05.440 --> 01:53:07.440]  Yeah, right
[01:53:07.600 --> 01:53:09.940]  Yeah, that could be passed on generation to generation
[01:53:10.720 --> 01:53:15.700]  So I guess we only have a couple minutes left. We have about seven minutes here and I want to discuss nomenclature
[01:53:16.640 --> 01:53:21.040]  Because I think uh, it's an important topic. I think something that should be discussed more
[01:53:21.840 --> 01:53:25.040]  you know because I think we have indica sativa hybrid
[01:53:25.760 --> 01:53:27.760]  as the base for what the
[01:53:28.080 --> 01:53:30.240]  The average person knows is cannabis
[01:53:30.800 --> 01:53:32.160]  when uh
[01:53:32.160 --> 01:53:36.340]  You know, you can have something with a sativa structure that expresses indica characteristics
[01:53:37.220 --> 01:53:38.660]  Vice versa
[01:53:38.660 --> 01:53:44.680]  How do you guys feel about the the term indica sativa hybrid and do you think we should be using equatorial tropical?
[01:53:45.460 --> 01:53:47.460]  narrow leaf drug varietals
[01:53:47.780 --> 01:53:51.060]  Wide leaf drug varietals. What what are your thoughts on that guys?
[01:53:54.220 --> 01:53:59.660]  I guess grasshopper we don't heard from you in a minute. Let's uh, you have an opinion
[01:54:01.420 --> 01:54:03.420]  Yeah, sure, um
[01:54:04.060 --> 01:54:09.260]  You know, yeah personally is going to take a transition within the community and um
[01:54:10.220 --> 01:54:14.080]  But you know at this point, you know communicating and understanding
[01:54:15.260 --> 01:54:17.260]  each other have been
[01:54:17.420 --> 01:54:19.420]  You know, we stuck with those
[01:54:19.740 --> 01:54:21.740]  with the older terminologies
[01:54:21.980 --> 01:54:24.300]  Or the ones that we made up. Um
[01:54:25.340 --> 01:54:30.300]  Yeah, and I do agree that we should advance we should move forward and get more scientific with it
[01:54:31.260 --> 01:54:33.260]  And I think it's
[01:54:33.340 --> 01:54:36.540]  you know shows like these and exactly what you're doing right now to
[01:54:37.260 --> 01:54:42.620]  To expand on that and open the conversation and start educating the broader public and the community about
[01:54:43.580 --> 01:54:45.980]  What's scientifically appropriate?
[01:54:47.180 --> 01:54:49.180]  Just be my take
[01:54:50.380 --> 01:54:52.380]  Jamal yeah, I mean
[01:54:53.820 --> 01:54:55.820]  I still use indica and sativa
[01:54:55.980 --> 01:55:02.060]  But I feel like narrow and wide narrow leaf and wide leaf drug type seems like the
[01:55:03.740 --> 01:55:05.740]  Best description
[01:55:06.060 --> 01:55:08.060]  um
[01:55:08.700 --> 01:55:14.140]  But you know, it's tough because I mean if you like when you break into a pack of seeds you might have different phenos that
[01:55:14.780 --> 01:55:21.980]  You know, some have terpenes that are sativa effect and some that have you know indica quote-unquote effects from the same same genetics
[01:55:22.540 --> 01:55:26.860]  Um, I mean, yeah, I mean I just use wide leaf or narrow leaf drug type
[01:55:28.380 --> 01:55:31.200]  You know if if people need a better description
[01:55:32.060 --> 01:55:32.540]  um
[01:55:32.540 --> 01:55:39.020]  But I think the most important part like what everybody else is saying is that it's important to have the conversation because before this
[01:55:39.500 --> 01:55:44.380]  You know, it was originally like kind bud. There wasn't even a name for the strain. It was just weed
[01:55:44.780 --> 01:55:47.020]  um, and so like as we develop our
[01:55:47.640 --> 01:55:52.060]  Vocabulary in the you know in this industry, you know, and then we had turps and everything is turps now
[01:55:52.620 --> 01:55:54.620]  um, you know as we develop the
[01:55:55.160 --> 01:55:58.700]  Vocabulary, I think that we'll find something that makes the most sense
[01:55:59.580 --> 01:56:01.580]  uh, but I
[01:56:02.300 --> 01:56:05.180]  You know, it's it's so hard it's it's hard. It's a hard one
[01:56:05.900 --> 01:56:07.020]  Yeah
[01:56:07.020 --> 01:56:09.020]  Steve what's your thoughts?
[01:56:09.100 --> 01:56:15.260]  Yeah, I think we're on the right path with edu-ka what this channel does and what you're doing is
[01:56:15.740 --> 01:56:18.780]  Definitely educating people about terpenes and the different effects
[01:56:19.740 --> 01:56:21.740]  Is on the right path. It's hard
[01:56:22.300 --> 01:56:27.340]  I think in a commercial market to sell some someone especially someone that's not too familiar
[01:56:28.220 --> 01:56:34.060]  How to describe it, you know, it's like you got the up effect. You got the down effect. That's as close as people are getting
[01:56:35.020 --> 01:56:39.260]  In the commercial market, but we all know there's a huge gray area in between
[01:56:40.060 --> 01:56:42.060]  and um
[01:56:42.940 --> 01:56:43.980]  I think
[01:56:43.980 --> 01:56:46.460]  Wide leaf narrow leaf is closer. I mean
[01:56:47.020 --> 01:56:53.180]  I think there needs to be a lot of education to in the commercial market before anything's going to change like that
[01:56:53.180 --> 01:56:55.180]  but I do remember when
[01:56:55.260 --> 01:57:00.220]  We were smoking sativas and all of a sudden when indica that's all we ever called it and came in and then
[01:57:00.540 --> 01:57:03.900]  That's all I wanted for a long time was nothing but indica
[01:57:04.860 --> 01:57:08.460]  so, I mean it's been around for a long time and it's gonna be
[01:57:09.100 --> 01:57:12.860]  I don't know how we're gonna educate people and get people out of that
[01:57:13.420 --> 01:57:18.540]  Train of thought because we all know it's right. We know as growers that it's it's wrong
[01:57:19.180 --> 01:57:21.180]  Slowly, but surely is all I can think
[01:57:21.980 --> 01:57:26.060]  you know part of the reason I asked this question was uh to talk with gordon about our
[01:57:26.620 --> 01:57:29.900]  Mutual friend and partner jason and his flavor wheel
[01:57:30.460 --> 01:57:34.140]  But what are your opinions gordon on the indica sativa hybrid?
[01:57:35.740 --> 01:57:37.740]  Well, I think it's uh
[01:57:38.220 --> 01:57:45.020]  I I think anytime we try and put something into a binary like that, especially like a whole, you know, I mean there's
[01:57:46.620 --> 01:57:48.620]  You know all the
[01:57:50.300 --> 01:57:57.840]  I mean there's still controversy I guess and and here we are having the conversation about it. It's like, you know, what's like the proper classification?
[01:57:58.860 --> 01:58:03.420]  uh, you know, are we going to start identifying subspecies like
[01:58:04.780 --> 01:58:06.780]  you know, there's
[01:58:08.140 --> 01:58:10.240]  Like we're we're trying to classify
[01:58:11.100 --> 01:58:16.140]  uh a very broad spectrum and I think that
[01:58:17.500 --> 01:58:23.660]  Sure for you know at this point of you know, we've got uh,
[01:58:24.300 --> 01:58:27.900]  Cannabis kind of coming out of the shadows in a certain regard
[01:58:28.380 --> 01:58:30.380]  uh, and so
[01:58:30.540 --> 01:58:35.340]  Here's this very simple binary system that people can use to
[01:58:36.140 --> 01:58:40.460]  To at least kind of point the finger into the direction of well
[01:58:40.540 --> 01:58:47.360]  These are really diverse and there's like all kinds of different effects that they may have and that's an entirely subjective
[01:58:47.800 --> 01:58:53.660]  Experience too, by the way, uh, so something that is one way for one person might be different for somebody else
[01:58:54.300 --> 01:58:56.300]  uh
[01:58:56.460 --> 01:58:58.460]  You know it is
[01:58:59.340 --> 01:59:03.500]  I I mean again, I think what everybody's saying is that that uh,
[01:59:04.140 --> 01:59:07.500]  You know as the as the conversations continue as the
[01:59:10.380 --> 01:59:14.540]  The relationship between cannabis and uh
[01:59:15.820 --> 01:59:23.020]  You know and and those who appreciate uh cannabis goes, uh, you know that
[01:59:23.980 --> 01:59:25.800]  you know our
[01:59:25.800 --> 01:59:29.840]  possibility of of of more subtle and nuanced
[01:59:30.680 --> 01:59:32.680]  language
[01:59:32.760 --> 01:59:34.760]  uh is
[01:59:34.840 --> 01:59:37.400]  You know, I mean there's there's a a huge
[01:59:38.600 --> 01:59:42.360]  range of of potential there, uh, and
[01:59:43.240 --> 01:59:45.480]  You know and and how far any?
[01:59:47.080 --> 01:59:52.940]  Given person wants to interact with that is just you know, sort of commensurate with their relationship
