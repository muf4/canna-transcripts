You have some homies join?
Yeah, we'll have some people jumping in here.
Cheers everybody.
We're just here tonight doing a impromptu,
just kind of community hash out.
Just all the hash heads come together
and smoke some hash, you know, talk hash,
all the good stuff.
You'd think I'd be good at time zones and shit by now,
by all the freaking shit I've been putting out,
but hey, woo, yeah, been a heavy consuming day.
Got lost in the sauce somewhere.
I missed the time, but it's all good.
What time is it for you right now?
6.40.
Okay, okay.
Yeah, I'm just an hour behind Eastern time.
Yeah, I don't know those times.
Oh yeah, we'll be having some people pop in and such.
What's up?
Cheers, dog, cheers, TAC.
Garage, that's a good cat.
He's always hanging out over on Chris's show and stuff.
That's fine.
I need to make a trip out there towards you.
Okay, man.
Where are you smoking on tonight, dude?
Dude, right now I'm about to smoke on this Rainbow Belt
since it cools up, but right now,
actually I had a rep, like one of the cold gold reps
from out in Humboldt send me a jar
this week of this nap time.
Oh yeah?
Yeah.
We get that heavily here.
Oh, really?
Cold, yeah.
Yeah, dude, literally actually, literally met this,
dude, funny thing is, brother,
we met this kid off Xbox.
Like, I swear to God, literally just randomly
on the Gulag, kid had a good name and like,

Homie's like, yeah, let's run it.

That's cool, man, it's just crazy.
Sometimes all it takes is like, yo, what's up?

You a hash head?
Yeah, I'm a hash head, so.

No, this is actually a local guy, man.
This is a Humade Death.
Wow, that's fire.

Like, that thing's fire.
Yeah, this is badass, dude.
It's faceted, it's got the little fucking, yeah, dude.

Can't really see it.
Kinda see the calmo.

Oh, my Lord, yes, sir.
That's fire.
That's lit.
Yeah, dude, he's killing it.
Yeah, he's straight killing it,
but I love that local art.
It's lit.
Definitely gotta support the locals.
Oh, yeah, everybody.
Tie Sticks, what's up?
Wayne, cheers.
What's everybody smoking on?
What's up, Lobster?
I see he's getting his stuff all straightened out,
I think, getting all connected.
He's gonna come say what's up,
and I'm gonna burn some.
I know he's been working on some stuff from Mace.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, like black Cuban haze and stuff like that,
those mixes, so it'll be fun to see
what he found through that.
I recently just actually picked up,
he just was selling some teens, just hooking it up.
He sold a teen the other day to one of my friends.
It was a RS-11 teen from Doja.
Oh, fuck yeah.
So I was like, yeah, I was like,
I'll take a couple clippings off that
and I'll run that in my tent.
Yeah, my buddy said he can get that,
and I was like, yeah, you go ahead, grab it.
I won't be a problem.
Yeah, literally I was like,
yeah, if you just wanna give me a couple,
and she's like, yeah, if you just wanna,
I was like, really?
Okay.
Thank you, thank you.
I'm gonna get to dabbing real quick.
Hell yeah.
What's up, Garden?
Cheers.
I haven't taken a dab in like four hours.
What piece is that?
I think it's nice.
It's a Boom Falazzi.
This is a local SoCal artist up in,
he's located in Newport Beach.
This is a 2017.
Fuck yeah, dude, I really like the geometry of that.
Yeah, bro, I actually have another one.
I have a newer one too, let me grab it.
Yeah, yeah, fucking bust out.
See, I gotta get a Peli for mine.
I still roll up in like the padded lunchbox, bro.
Okay.
At least it's still doing it.
Yeah, yeah.
I got too many Peli's, man.
I got like the suitcase Peli too.
Yeah.
I was just looking at them today, actually.
Yeah, this one is a 2023.
All fumed.
Yeah, full fumed.
Yeah.
That's beautiful.
What is it, 14?
Actually 10.
10?
Decent, yes.
Actually too, out of all the people,
people are like, wow, this is a 14?
They're like, no, 10.
Everyone's really far away.
This is a 10.
Yeah, it's just a 10.
That's beautiful, man.
Yeah.
Oh, it's doing bottom work too?
Hell yeah.
Doing bottom work.
Yeah.
Just got this one at Las Vegas recently.
Fuck yeah.
That's what's up.
Well, is it melt time already?
I gotta do it.
Let's go.
I think so.
I'm ready, huh?
I love them.
Dabbing commendo perps hash Ross and I made.
Okay, that's fired.
That's awesome.
Anything you made that'd be awesome.
You wanna jump on?
You wanna jump on, bro?
Take a dab-ski?
Come on, dog, jump on.
Let me put the invite out there.
Just for anybody who wanna come on and smoke some hash.
Cheers, everyone at Howie's Garden.
Cheers, dog.
Yeah.
Cheers, everyone.
What was I doing?
Grabbing shit for melt?
Yes, sir, grabbing shit for melt.
Got a nice little jar of some rainbow belts.
Let that cold cure up a little bit.
I should be later picking up a key from my buddy's grow
from up north.
You said what?
Should be picking up a key of some hash later tonight.
One of my buddy's grows from up north.
Nice.
Yeah, bro.
So yeah, I wanna, we'll have some flavors
for all of us to do a little review on.
Yeah, my buddy's fucking grabbing some stuff from Colorado
and got some pretty gnarly flavors.
Let me see what's coming in.
Yeah, I'm only gonna have four flavors, but.
Well, it's.
Four is nice.
I agree.
I agree.
More than two is enough for me.
Shabowski's.
Of course, the truffles.
We got the white truffle, the truffle cake,
the banana conda, chocolate dip bananas.
What?
Garlic ice mints, poutine pie, grape pie, chantry.
I don't even know what the fuck that one is.
Zealously and gelati.
Well, I'm happy I recognized you.
I thought you recognized me from Las Vegas, brother.
Good to see you again, dog.
Oh, Ty6 is there?
Hell yeah, dude.
Yeah, Ty6, he said he recognized me from Las Vegas.
What's up, Lobster?
Having a little bit of trouble, bro?
Always at Glass Vegas, champs,
every single year, guys, always.
Any Glass events.
I miss champs when they came here, too.
Mirror from the Matrix, cheers, bro.
Oh, man.
Hopefully for the Michigan Glass project this year,
I'll be kind of y'alls way.
Okay, what about doing an event out there,
the 15th in Niles, Michigan.
They're gonna have Steve Seislove out there.
It's a hash event, you know what I mean?
They're having like a single source competition,
but there's gonna be like an event in style set up
and shit, you know, everybody coming out and kicking it.
It's gonna be badass.
Yeah, it's lit, it's super lit.
I love it.
All right, so this is from the third room.
Blowtrops, this stuff is dumb.
Stupid fire.
Full melt.
He said, it's not a six star, it's five and a half star.
But shit, stupid fire.
Super complex.
It's really nice.
So I'll make a nice little flag.
Yeah, full melt is making a little comeback this year,
I think, already.
Into last year, it already started to.
I need to go put the rest of it back in the fridge
before it starts turning.
Yeah, Ty, I'm definitely down.
Next time we're all together,
I'm definitely down to set you up, bro, 100%.
Sorry, Alex, I started late, actually.
Yeah, I did the whole time zone thing all fucked up.
Sorry, brother.
Little big dummy.
Come jump on, man, you gotta teach me something.
20 minute difference doesn't kill it that much.
I just go put it in the freezer
after I smoosh it for a second.
Taking a dab of this.
Cold gold.
Now, come on.
He's fire, man.
He's got a lot of his stuff through the Midwest
and super fire.
Yeah, I like it.
I'm definitely happy with it.
They're killing their product up there.
All right, so for anybody who's just wondering,
I'm using a nonstick oatmeal
because I didn't have any parchment paper.
But yeah, you just put-
That's fire.
That's awesome.
You put some melts in your parchment paper
and you push it down with your thumb.
The heat from your thumb will create a nice little flag.
That's how I like to pledge allegiance to the flag.
That was a little toasty.
Oh, you live in Vegas?
Hell yeah, bro.
Always in Vegas, bro.
I love Vegas.
I'm watching you in Vegas in two weeks.
So let's link up, bro.
Hit me up on Instagram, bro.
We'll use die sticks.
I'll do it.
All right.
What's going on, everybody?
Just had a downstem made yesterday, too.
Oh, hey, who's that through?
Yeah, I broke the downstem like two months ago.
Yeah.
I love those little chuggers, man.
Those things are badass.
Right?
Went over to the homie's shop
and just sat there and he's like,
how big do you want the holes?
I was like, bro, just every time he'd just sit there
and be like a little bigger, a little bigger.
Like now it's perfect, straight shredder.
So you go to a lot of events out there and stuff?
Yeah, a lot of events.
Last two nights, we've been at events.
We had a high rise event last night
and the night before we had an ice fire,
ice fire event for ice fire for the device.
Yeah, man, and then yesterday or earlier today,
we had a Masonics event, a Super Smash Bros event.
Badass, dude.
Yeah, yeah, go play Super Smash Bros against everyone,
smoke some hash, get some seeds,
get some clones, talk with everyone.
I'm about to, I'm definitely gonna have to hit him up
on some beans, man.
That Wilson, man, I had something that Wilson last night.
Everyone listening, everyone listening right now,
Masonics is doing a hundred beans.
Yeah, I think it's like $100.
10 packs for a hundred bucks.
10 packs, yeah, 10 packs for a hundred bucks.
10 packs, you're getting 50 seeds, 50 seeds, I believe.
50 seeds for a hundred bucks.
No, you're getting, it's 12 seeds in each pack.
The other day I was saying he was saying five,
but I guess it's not.
Okay, yeah.
So if it's five, Jesus, or I mean if it's 12,
coming up 120 seeds for a hundred bucks?
Yeah, that's what he's saying, it's crazy.
Yeah, that's a.
It's good.
Dude, and he had some really, really,
really good genetics available.
Oh yeah, that looks like it fire.
That was melt?
Yeesh!
That was perfect, Tim.
Hey, man.
Actually, it's melting nice, bro, oh my Lord.
Look at that.
You can see the heads perfectly.
That shit tastes so good.
It's blowtrops from.
Yeah, but I smell.
What is the strain on that?
It's blowtrop, so it's,
something crossed the trough,
but I'm not a huge trough fan,
so when he told me that shit, I was like,
eh, he's like, don't worry, don't worry,
because trough like takes over everything, dude.
Bro, you smoked trough to the rig,
the whole rig tastes like trough, you already know.
Yeah, man, that's what I'm saying,
it'll like stain your rig, so.
That's crazy, I'm a trough fanatic.
I'm a trough fiend, I love trough.
Yeah, it's just fire, dude.
It's super fire, you can't even taste the trough.
Wow, hell yeah, we got a one day deal of Dynasty,
also 15 packs for $100.
Wow, that's fire.
Fuck yeah.
It's a great deal.
Full moon.
Popping beans on the full moon.
I'm not popping any more beans for a minute, Ty.
Yeah, me either, right now I'm just trying to get some teens.
I got my waves.
That I washed, and it's fucking phenomenal, right here.
I wanna do a pheno hunt, I wanna do a pheno hunt
after I do this next grow, but I still don't have time
right now, I need to get some stuff going.
Yeah, for sure.
Yeah, everyone's asking.
My buddy has that pie hoe cut that I wanna get
from Canerado, that'd be fire.
That'd be fire.
Pie hoe's a washer, pie hoe's a great washer.
Yeah, one, we got pink zittles, I wanna see how that does.
We got so much shit right now, it's ridiculous, bro.
Shout out True High Chicago.
Putting me on.
Fire, 150 for 200, 15 or two, but that's fine,
that's a good deal, still a good deal.
Even for 200, though.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, still, yeah, even for 200.
I got faith in it this time, Lobster.
Almost.
Technical difficulties.
Going in on somebody, getting in here.
Rising trichomes.
Ooh, nice, all right, all right.
Where's Corey Slapa?
We need a Slurpa, Corey, nice.
You got some papaya?
Oh yeah, papaya's nice, we actually got that cut.
This is the Bicket OG from our good friend Corey from chat.
Mission Hill Melts processed it.
Fire, fire.
It's stupid, bro.
I've had Bicket from three different processors.
Oh, that looks ultra tasty.
Like, it's just glistening on top.
On the top, it's glistening on the top.
Oh, you see the pools, the turp pools on the bottom?
Yeah, you can literally see, oh yeah, oh yeah,
you can literally see, oh yeah, for sure.
Literally, that little air pocket
with just straight turps just busting, oh yeah, oh yeah.
It's fucking, it's nice, dude,
because it has the foulness,
but not like the usual gut-wrenching.
Yeah, I saw you rotting,
trying, hopefully we'll be able to get it figured out.
But yeah, so it has a little bit of cherry,
like the cherry pie coming through heavy.
Ah, speaking of that shit, here we go.
I was just talking about you, Corey.
Yeah, man, I got my signals crossed time-wise.
Yeah, me too, sorry.
I was supposed to start at your time, and I didn't.
That's okay.
I didn't do it, I'm sorry.
I'm blaming it on rotten.
So you're having technical problems?
We'll see if he can get it straight.
He's almost got it straightened out.
Yes, sir, Ty Sticks, we'll get you back
with the follow, dog, thank you, dog.
Appreciate you guys.
Yeah, Corey, I was just saying, dude,
I was about to take a dab of this Bickett OG.
I'll join you.
Yeah, that looks fire.
It's dank.
Looks super turpy, as we were just saying.
Nice turpy hockey from the bottom.
Yeah, I was able to get a couple people
to try it last night, Corey, that are pretty heavy
in the fucking, you know, solving this game
here in Chicago and stuff like that.
The guy who owns Made Gallery, I let him try it,
and Third Room and stuff like that.
And they're saying it's one of the more unique ones
of the Bicketts anybody's had because of that,
the nuances of that cherriness.
Like, it's almost like a dark cherry chocolate
that comes through on it, you know what I mean?
Into that funk that's just nasty, dude.
It's awesome.
It's definitely tasty.
I like it.
It's different from the first run that I had
that was way more GMO heavy, and it was really good.
You know, it had a good high to it, a lot of turps.
This one's different, just different.
I like it a lot.
I like it differently, but yeah, a lot different.
And this one came down earlier, so, you know,
I don't know if that plays anything into it.
How much earlier?
Probably, I think I pulled out.
Probably a week early.
Okay.
In the last one.
I'm about to go a week later on the next one.
You know, probably a week.
And I don't know if that's typical,
because I've talked to some people
that say that they do that,
and some people say, no, don't bother.
You know, I don't know.
Do you pull yours generally early, normal?
I just started.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?
Like, it's all new to me, so I can pull it this way,
that way, or that way, and it's all new to me, so.
But I guess my question is,
would you pull it any different
if you were gonna be curing it for flower?
No, I'm not.
I'm actually gonna take this one a week longer,
just to see the nuances and the changes of turps
from that week longer, from this one.
You know what I mean?
Just because I wanna see, so.
Yep.
We got Derek Nelson in chat,
smoking on some Bicket Rosin as well.
Yeah, literally, I just saw that.
We also said we got Peace of Mind Farming,
said he's been smoking on a classic volcano.
That was 20-year-old classic volcano.
20 years old, that is insane, that's amazing.
They're rugged.
It's a good quality product.
Oh, this trouble.
20 years old.
Oh, what up?
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Magpie's been a hash monster lately, man.
Yeah, look at him, hash.
He's been getting those fucking trays.
He's like, hey, I need a whole room for my hash trays.
Don't mind me.
I tried it, man.
I tried it, man.
I put balls on the world.
I'm just gonna fix my half-lose, one sec.
Yeah, yeah.
Oh yeah, dude, that's what's up.
I love seeing people go crazy.
Put this back in the fridge.
Magpie's got the stash, the stockpile.
There we go.
Now I can hear you.
Yeah, yeah.
What are you guys saying?
We were just making fun of you.
Oh, that's not very nice.
No, it was nice making fun of him.
Got me right in the fucking feeling hole.
You're a monster, bro.
You're done.
You're gonna have to make another room for all your hash.
You gotta make another bedroom
because your bedroom's gotta be done.
Bro, you think that?
But like, I smoke through it pretty quick though.
I keep the levels up.
Heard that.
Full saturation, Magpie.
Yeah, and I smoke it sloppy too.
Like, I don't smoke it like you guys.
I just glob that shit onto stuff and fucking hack on it.
I don't do dabs and be all efficient.
Yeah, yeah.
I haven't been to work on you yet.
Dog, no, I have.
Like, not that I don't appreciate it all.
Trust me, I got tons of dab shit.
There you go.
I just like smoking big fucking globs of hash.
You're on mute.
How you doing?
Grape guava pie.
I don't know this one.
I just took this one out of the freezer.
This is from my buddy's outdoor up north.
Hell yeah.
So this is like three,
like 340 grams.
Decent, hell yeah.
Once this one cures, this one's awesome.
This one's like, I'll pull it out.
This one smokes great.
I got you a little in here, dog.
You all right, no?
Hell yeah, bro.
Yes, sir.
Boom.
Looks like fire, bro.
I love it.
We got everyone here.
Let's get it.
Is it working?
Hell yeah, we got you, bro.
Well shit, what's up, gentlemen?
What's up, dog?
What's up?
Yes, sir.
Ooh, somebody's talking about donuts.
I wanted to give a testimonial
to the strength, power, and flavor of that Bicket OG.
Oh, geez.
Cory is not playing right now.
It's a rugged one.
It's Bicket time.
Oh.
Hell yeah.
And now I talked to Terp Wizard.
So we're going to have one of those
solventless conversations with him.
I'm going to go and see him in April at the event.
And so I'm going to get a couple jars over to SCP.
So if any of the viewers and stuff like that
want to be able to smoke on some of that
during the show to ask questions live and stuff like that,
it'll be available for y'all to be able to pick up beforehand.
We'll get all that strained out
and get all the information out to everybody before.
But yeah, I'm pretty stoked on that.
It'll be fun.
Create a banner, hashtag Bicket time.
And so how many times have you watched that Bicket, Cory?
Just the two.
I've got two 4x4s of it running right now.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I think I'd be hard pressed to dry it anymore.
Yeah, right?
It's nice.
I don't see any reason to.
Yeah, people, I'll tell you.
This one just like, as I get more into it,
I like it, man.
Yeah, it's foul, but.
Yeah, it's got a little sweetness.
And a little something extra.
Yeah, it's got like a little sweetness.
What is that the one you said you let go longer
or you took it down earlier?
Earlier.
Yeah.
Oh, whoa.
That's a fatty.
In honor of the Bicket man, Cory.
Hey, Cory, what do you call this?
Slurp-a.
Oh, snap.
I'm gonna get that vortex, I think, tomorrow.
Yeah, I'm gonna get that.
The Coro Vortex.
Pretty badass, the suppression on it's badass.
I was thinking about getting one of those knots, though.
I like those knots.
I love the knot.
I don't know, where's my good one at?
How many things do you have on it, five?
I have a four, I have a brand new four stack.
And then I have a super coated six.
That'll burn through some stuff.
Oh yeah, this one, I've had this one for like,
this one, I've had this one for like two years.
Shout out Skunk Ape.
I do love the knot.
This is my favorite marble from him.
That thing's fire.
He's local?
He's down in Alabama.
Oh, okay, fire.
Oh yeah.
South, it's somewhere.
Yeah, yeah, South.
Yeah, South.
Yeah, man.
Skunk Ape.
Oh yeah, him and his family are really good friends.
Got the fat ass glob?
Rod, Rod.
Rod is going in?
Yeah, Rod.
Rod, Rod.
Man, he puts some lobs in there.
Sounds like a lob.
Lobsies?
I gotta get a dab right, dude.
No carb cap.
First off, that bicket, man.
I'm excited.
It's about to collapse my lungs.
Collapse my lungs.
It's always nice.
So Magpie, what are you doing to wash?
How are you washing your stuff?
You wanna give us a little breakdown?
Yeah, I just wash in one of those little blue
and white machines, little five gallon machines.
For right now, like I'd love to have a bigger one,
but I don't got the money for that right now.
That's all I'm using right now is a big, I think.
Yeah.
Yeah, I just catch it at 25.
I know most people say to do it in a 45,
but I just find I like it better out of the 25.
Then I throw in a 160,
a 190 or a 170 on top of that,
depending on what I can find,
and then a work bag on top of that.
And that's it.
I don't use a work bag in the machine.
I just throw the weed and ice in the machine.
And then, yeah, I just collect it, microplane it down,
and then I just slow dry it in the fridge.
Right.
You know what I mean?
I know the freeze dryer's working, whatnot,
but I'm not dropping fucking four grand on a freeze dryer.
A lot of people-
Works just fine in the fridge.
The fridge dry technique and the wine fridges and stuff,
people are using stuff like that.
And sometimes on those,
you're even able to dial them in a little bit more.
But-
I mean, you get it good enough.
The fridge, if you just have a solitary fridge
that's just for that,
you can get it down to almost freezing
and 20%, 25% humidity.
You can get it pretty good.
There's a buddy down here that strictly air dries like that.
And his stuff is fire, man.
It comes out different than anybody else's
and not necessarily in a bad aspect.
I like it because it gives it nuances that
these other ways of doing it won't.
Yeah, once I had the money and I could get one,
I'd play around with a freeze dryer for sure.
But, I mean, I know it seems that freeze dried shit
dabs a lot better.
It's easier to get multiple thing going on.
But, I mean, that could just be
what size bags you're using too.
Because I know when I've done separated out runs
where I separate out all the bags,
you can find certain ones that melt better.
But I don't know, for me,
when I just mix them all together, it just hits better.
And then if you don't clean your air dryer
or your freeze dryer and stuff, you know what I mean?
Oh yeah, but that's like fucking with everything for growing
like you're basically a cleaning lady and that's fine.
So what has been your favorite
that you've taken down so far and hashed out?
I don't know, like just straight for hash,
like probably the 44 dogs and the Mary Lou have been the best
I don't have a ton of them left,
but this is from the last one.
This is the Mary Lou from middle of September.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
That's always with the fire.
That's stick, yeah.
And like it was a lot obviously,
it was a mirror trunk.
That's just wet, you know?
Yeah, bro.
Oh my Lord.
I bet that'll put you on your fucking-
Yeah, literally.
Turn my camera around.
Yeah, that'll probably put you slapper on the ground.
Love the roller.
Hell yeah.
Nice.
Man, like you can still handle it,
but it's real muddy.
It's melty.
Yeah, like yum.
You know, it's fire when it's like that.
Yeah, and that's just the same way as always, right?
So that's 25 to 159.
And then I just squish it down with a glass bottle.
Just like originally, that's how I learned,
just watching those Frenchie videos that everybody's seen.
Yeah, I was at church today.
Yeah, I clicked on for a sec.
I was busy in the garden.
I wasn't really chatting or anything.
Yeah, I think you're always busy
in the garden almost now, eh?
Most of the time, yeah.
That's a good thing.
Yeah, you're absolutely good.
That's the 44 dogs there.
Wow, that looks nice too.
Sheesh.
Wow, that looks super nice.
Put that in the middle of a fucking joint.
Bye-bye.
Good Lord.
Bye-bye.
I can't even imagine.
Rolled a little half-gram of snake that,
but then a donut.
Yeah, that's what I do with most of it.
Like I've tried dabbing them and all that
just to see what it does and all that stuff.
If anything, I just dab it on like a needle over a screen.
Yeah, like it does work in the banger.
Like I've tried them in my drop-ins and whatnot,
and they do work,
but like you're definitely not burning everything.
You know what I mean?
100%, 100%.
And this one comes out pretty good.
This is some Pistol Whip from probably a little bit earlier,
maybe, I don't know, maybe August or so.
This is all indoor stuff.
And this one came out like a lot more chunky.
Which one was that?
This is Pistol Whip from Pistol Positive Levi and Jay.
But if I can smoosh it open.
Oh yeah.
North of 49 in check.
That's dope.
Oh wow, look how blonde it is inside.
But it smells so nice.
Holy shit, yeah.
The outside is just, oh, that's fire.
Yeah, and like they'll still be,
even when they, I've noticed that,
like even when they get all kind of dry and waxy
and stuff like that,
like you'll still get like a super easy melt off bit.
Like you just do a quick little lighter test to it.
Yeah, look at that.
Hash born.
So like it does melt pretty good,
but like there's definitely a difference.
You can see the other two are definitely a lot more melty.
Oh yeah.
Now what temperature is the water
when you're using it in the bottle?
Essentially it's gonna be different for everybody
because it's as hot as your hands can handle.
So like it comes out of the kettle
and you put it in the glass bottle.
And then, I mean, you can wear gloves and shit like that,
but I tend not to,
cause the rubber gloves don't like a ton of heat.
And the, like wearing cotton gloves and shit like that,
I find it only takes one time fucking up
and then you end up with little strands
and bits of cotton and shit like that in the hash.
So I just go until your hands can take it.
So I mean, if you're fucking working all day
and you got some leather,
then you could probably get pretty high,
you know what I mean?
150, 160, maybe 170,
but it just depends on how hot
you can hold onto that bottle, right?
But I've never measured it to see.
Like I get it going pretty good.
And I mean, you can use something to push down on top of it
like a pot holder or an oven mitt or something
does work okay.
But I just find you always end up,
I always end up ditching it
just cause I can't see what the fuck I'm doing properly.
Like use a clear bottle
so you can kind of see what you're doing.
Just cause I find you don't want to like
completely turn it into liquid, right?
It goes kind of weird after that.
You just kind of want to congeal it all together.
If it goes real syrupy,
it doesn't want to come back together
and you end up like how that one is,
but kind of right away where like instantly
there's almost like a syrup or a gel all over the paper
that you're just never able to scrape back off.
This one's kind of seeped out over time,
just sitting in the jar.
But you can tell if you kind of overcooked it
and it'll look like,
it's almost like the rosin is trying to separate
from whatever is not rosin in there.
Like almost like you tried to press it without a bag.
So,
forget anything else.
So let's all just like find little nuances
and every batch is different.
Fucking ripped.
I could see you sitting there like.
I was thinking the same thing.
I look, I see you like,
I don't know what I'm going to say next.
Oh no, I think I'll do another one for that.
I'll do some of the ways to try to counteract it.
Wow.
That melt was so beautiful though.
Oh my God.
Yeah, I'm super curious how this outdoor is going to turn out.
Watching the shit on outdoor from last year.
Let's see the wetness.
It's like this shit hasn't been pressed yet.
This shit's just been dried.
So this has been in the fridge for like three weeks
and I'm just waiting for the rest of the trays
to finish drying and I'll start pressing stuff.
I'm not in a big rush.
I don't care if it oxidizes and shit.
Yeah.
Ryan, what do you,
you went just ran through a bunch of stuff.
What'd you just run through?
I looked so far.
A mixed wash of some sun grown.
I was actually just going to say to Magpie,
I had at least one genetic
where the flowers indoor looked better.
Were you asking me DP?
Yeah.
Okay, I'm trying.
Yeah, one genetic was clear cut day and night
between indoor and outdoor.
The indoor flower actually looked better,
but the dab came out tasting like some popcorn swag.
And then sun grown, the same genetic
where the flowers didn't look as healthy.
I mean, it's glorious, like beautiful tasting dab.
So I'm going to see if other genetics do that same thing,
but if I get at least like a six out of 10 ratio,
I'm saying sun grown for the win as far as concentrate.
I want to see at least six out of 10,
but this one out of one is like no contact.
Oh, so far.
What was that?
We lost Magpie?
What was that Magpie?
I said three years in a row now,
it always seems like the sun grown ash
is better than the indoor.
Like the indoor might have like a slightly more refined
taste, like to the true taste of a flower,
but I don't know.
Clean up your hash, like it's gonna,
you're gonna get all that shit out of there anyways.
But when I'm here-
It's also cause my outdoor too, I can't dry properly.
Like the amount of outdoor I take down
with the amount of space I have to dry,
so it's not getting dried properly either.
So that right there could account for it.
Everybody's saying outdoor all day,
especially like white cats.
They're saying that's the way to go on hash.
You just get a fuller expression that makes-
Well, you get a better collection too.
You get way fatter heads growing in the sunshine.
The resin heads will all be bigger.
I've run clones like last year, the clones I put outside,
I had run inside two and three times in a row before that.
Every single one across the board, the heads were bigger.
Cause same as like the 160 collection and outdoor,
like your 160 bag will fill up crazy fast.
Where indoor, I mean, you could watch 10 pounds
and still only end up with like a little chunk of 160.
Yeah, I can't wait to start playing around
on some light depths and stuff.
Or even just get a full outdoor season.
I don't care, I wanna go play.
I mean, coach, I'm ready to play.
You're ready for light depth life, DP?
You coming to the backwoods of Maine for the summer?
Let's do it, fuck it.
Let's blow this out.
I know you said be careful what you wish for today.
Let's do it.
It's easier to romanticize pulling those tarps
when it's pouring rain and cold.
It's tough work, man.
I hear you.
What are you running now, Ryan?
I'm focusing for concentrate for solvent list.
The honey banana Wilson zero is kind of like the bulk
of it right now.
And then a bunch of the Cuban black haze Wilson
for personal stash.
I heard that Cuban black haze is fucking dope.
On the horizon, a lot of people are messing with that.
Yeah, I was directly inspired by Immortal,
the cat that was on a couple episodes with you guys.
I saw that he did it when everyone else kind of said
it wasn't possible.
And I was like, well, if he did it, I'm gonna try at least.
It was a 0.25% return.
It wasn't even 1%, but it's tangible.
I have it in my hand and in the pipe,
which is the fucking balls.
I was just thinking the same thing.
It's like all the things that I like,
I like OGs and stuff like that.
I don't think that they have any use in this world.
You know what I mean?
For a head stash at least.
I think that's about it.
Yep, exactly.
Exactly.
And that's okay.
Yeah, as long as it's tangible, 0.25 works for me.
That's something real.
Yep.
Way more than zero.
Is that the first time you've run a mix?
Who, me?
No, Rotten.
Oh.
Yeah, I usually don't do mix washes.
This one was like all the different phenos mixed into one.
So it was kind of like a pheno wash.
Okay, so it wasn't a mix.
Gotcha, gotcha.
I'm hoping if I can select the right one out of those,
it must have been 15 females, maybe 20.
But if I can find one or two that work,
maybe I can get closer to like one or 2%,
which I'd be overjoyed with.
If I could get to 1%, I'm happy.
If I can get to two, I'm back flipping.
We'd definitely be able to do that.
If you select some, like one or something out of there,
you know what I mean?
Like concentrate on it and stuff, you'll be like,
you'll find it.
There's like six or seven draft picks left
out of like the 20 or so that made it the first round.
So I'm hoping like one of those will work.
I'll do individual washes with those ones.
Well, yeah, that's another thing I realized
takes like another complexity in the selecting.
Cause like the Mary Lou that I selected for hash,
if I was just purely selecting for flower,
I never would have kept it.
Didn't hit right, I didn't like the flavor or nothing.
And the hash brought out like all these subtle flavors
that aren't really heavy in the flower.
And the hash is some of the best I've made,
but the flower, I don't like smoking.
That's cool, very interesting.
It just fucking complicates things now.
Cause now you can't even fucking select on smoking the flower
you gotta wash it.
And that just adds like the fucking adds months, bro.
Just another seven steps.
Washing expedites everything for me now.
I don't have to, I just freeze it.
Stockpile it.
Yeah, but to wash 30 fucking genotypes separately, bro.
It's like, that's a whole nother thing.
Yeah, that's a winner.
Yeah, that's a good winner right there.
It'll be busy for sure.
Cause that's what I do.
Like I just mass wash all the phenotypes, genotypes,
wherever you want to call them out of a seed pack together.
And then I'll wash my keepers.
But then now I figured out you can't really do it that way.
If you really want to know,
you have to wash every single one
or you have to get to a point where you can kinda,
sometimes you can kinda see, you won't know for sure,
but you walk through a room and you can kinda
point out the ones or touch them.
And like the super greasy, drippy plants,
they're not gonna wash well.
So I mean, unless you're fucking in love with it,
it's not worth it.
But I mean, the jungle toads like that,
like the jungle toad from Tony, super fire flower,
hash is amazing, but you gotta love it.
That is, what is it?
Roberts Creek Congo to Ghost OG
times Chemdog Special Reserve.
Fireweed and the hash is amazing,
but maybe 2%, 3% and that's on like dried cured bubble.
So like that's not good, but.
I mean, it's fucking amazing though.
And the flower is fire too.
So I mean, it's a double win.
That shit better make your breakfast
for you too in the morning.
She's right.
If you got it, if you have, but if you got enough,
but it doesn't matter.
Yeah, if you can grow it.
Yeah.
It's really good.
Who cares?
Yeah, like that was one of the ones
that was 14 feet outside this past season.
And that was after heavy cutting the back.
Those in the backpacks and the Mary Lou's
were all 13, 14 feet tall.
What's the backpack?
That's black Guap fruit to space cheese.
Black Guap fruit is from Dutch.
And I think it's Catholic school girl to Larry Chimes,
but I might be completely wrong.
Don't quote me on that one.
I think it's Testa Rosa.
Yeah.
But don't quote me on that either.
But that's what.
No, you sound, no, no, no, no, no.
As soon as you said that though,
that sounded more right than what I just said.
I know.
Cause I remember hearing him talk about that one.
Yeah.
It's around that timeframe.
Yeah. Cause Tony worked with two of those.
He did the, there's a black Guap fruit
and a black Guap gold.
And I think one of them is a parent to the other one.
I think it's how it worked.
Your garden looks awesome, Magpie.
Yeah, it does.
Fucking trying.
I love how you have like a director's like way of shooting.
It's always like I'm walking in the room
like a Scorsese scene.
Yeah, bro, I love that shit.
I'm just like, okay, here's the girls.
Like, I love it, man.
That garden looks awesome.
Yeah, man.
I love doing the fucking little reels like that, bro.
Just whoosh.
And you fucking see all the plants.
You gotta come in through the kitchen next time.
Dog, that's, it's wild.
Same with the bedroom now.
Like I just reorganized it and put more shit in there.
Like it's full now though.
Like legit full.
I just saw your real couple, what, hour ago or something.
Dude, that thing's.
Yeah.
Yeah, I got, I fit more in there, bro.
I fit another three trays in.
Hey.
That's what I said, pop more.
That's what I said in the video.
I was like, you guys can't see the extra space.
It's just cause you gotta stare at it for a minute.
You just gotta want the fucking space.
That's decent though.
You don't even know how many you got.
Oh, I know.
Like, well, no.
Like I could tell you.
I'd have to go count them though.
I got a rough idea.
Imagine, imagine.
Here's what I know.
Here's what I do know.
It's under my plant count.
Boom.
Some, you have some.
Yeah, that's all that matters.
As long as I'm not above the plant count, I'm gravy.
Like even if I am, I just can't talk about it.
What's your plant count?
Nah, it's just under 400.
Oh, well, I mean, shit.
Yeah, I'm good.
Should be enough.
I think Michigan just changed like the amount
of their like hundred plant count is like stupid low now.
I think it's only like.
Yeah, fingers crossed.
If you're willing to fucking grease their palms
a little bit here, like it's all legal,
but that's all they want is money.
You give them a thousand bucks,
they'll give you a big plant count.
I'm out there.
Canada won't let me over there.
I have to change my name.
America won't let me over there.
So welcome to the fucking club, doc.
Is that for Michigan?
Is that for a caregiver or is that for a personal
like homegrown?
Yeah, it might be micro.
I don't know.
I'll have to check out.
I saw it.
I saw it.
Check out the dirty.
I don't think they're gonna do that.
Yeah, they started doing the micro lessons.
You gotta watch out for dirty.
He's drunk by this hour.
He'd be spazzing.
For reals, yo.
He even said he's like, I'm drunk, sorry.
You know when the sun goes down, homie, dirty shit.
Knocking at the moon.
Don't fucking call me after five o'clock, all right?
Hey, that's when I stop my fucking FICO.
Fat, that's a fatty in there.
It's a bigot in the waves.
What are you gonna put it on?
What?
I do a preheat.
I'll do like a green preheat and then I'll go to my white
because it takes a while for it to.
You're gonna smoke the green
and then you're gonna put the white in there.
That's what I just heard.
You should probably mute your camera.
I'm too old for that.
You said he didn't.
Bro, I'm just repeating exactly what I heard.
I guess like people that were just like listening to this,
like on a radio.
That's the best part about that.
Driving a car or something like that, you know?
Listen, misunderstandings are the fucking spice of life,
bro, come on.
So keep shit interesting.
No matter what you say, people can take it how they want.
It doesn't matter.
Just say whatever you want.
Try to get this bitch warm.
Don't shake your head at me, Corey.
Don't you fucking judge me.
He's looking for a slurper.
I get high every time I fucking do a dab of that.
Every single time.
He's looking for a slurper.
He's looking around trying to figure out
what left of the sugar in the house hasn't been eaten.
He's like, yo, what can I help you with?
You know what's up.
I'm free up today on Girl Scout cookies, man.
I just got like five packs of Girl Scout cookies today.
I'm good for a little while.
Yup.
Till tomorrow, anyways.
Yeah, that's one rough night away from being gone, dawg.
After this sesh, I don't even know, man.
I got nothing else to eat in my house.
Fuck it.
Sometimes you gotta eat five fucking boxes
of Girl Scout cookies and cry yourself to sleep.
It happens.
Sounds like a Tuesday.
There was a really cool event in Southern Maine today.
It was like women and cannabis focused.
And it was awesome.
They had a bunch of women were belly dancing
to Notorious B.I.G. and just like around.
It was a smoke friendly place.
It was very, very cozy.
Pretty good turnout?
Yeah, it's not like usually a big turnout event.
It's kind of super community based
where it's like all the people that are there
are there to talk to each other
more than like people just coming.
But it was awesome, man.
It was a beautiful day.
Good vibes.
Like it was really cool.
Awesome.
It's awesome.
Yeah.
Everyone was happy.
All the women were feeling tough.
DP's gonna fucking know it after this one.
Really, he's fucking, he's working on it hard.
He's trying to fucking show off
with his big dabs in a backfire.
He's like, check out this dab,
actually it'll blow your head right off.
I'm gonna go back to that garden.
Yeah, it's advertising.
Peter, you owe DP $35.
$35 per vessel sold.
Yeah, per brain cell exploded, he gets $35.
Oh shit.
Cocksucker.
Yo, the event today,
it was at a Hash Lab
and they had a skate park in one of the rooms.
Come on, yo.
Yo, I was tripping out.
It was skate parks, the fucking Hash Lab
and fucking women in cannabis.
It was like the coolest event ever.
I'm screaming my adoption papers over there.
Like somebody, please.
That's one of the best parts about,
like not a ton, but like the very few fucking
like old school weed dealers
that ended up in the legal market.
You go to their fucking warehouses
and it's like, this is our pool room.
This is our bar.
It's like, hell yeah.
Anybody do any dry or the static tech to clean up hash?
I know what it is, but I've never actually attempted it.
Like I remember watching the Johnny B videos
like fucking 10, 12 years ago before I was even growing.
And like back then I was buying weed.
So I wasn't trying to fucking do that.
But I definitely works.
Like I've seen people do it.
Seems like a lot of flux.
Yeah, I'm really interested.
The final product is so clean though.
Yeah, oh, a hundred percent.
But like, can you achieve just as clean of a product
from washing and using more of the filters
to your advantage rather than just doing a dump wash?
I don't know.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
Like I told, I mean, it seems like a lot of fucking work
and fucking around and I don't know.
I've never tried.
I mean, even like people will take like what they wash
in the bags and static tech that too though.
I go the other way.
I, when I do my seed crops, I collect my seeds
and then I take all that that comes out of my trim bin.
And then I wash that, like not literally wash it.
I wash it a Mason jar with ice,
get it rehydrated, nice and cold.
And then I put it through my bags, clean it up.
Fucking works great too.
Like the flavor is not quite right.
Cause I dried them for seed.
So like I didn't dry them with much care,
but whoo, goddamn definitely worked.
And driving share a wash, you guys, since we just started.
Yo, peep game.
Harry Rose was spitting big game the other day.
You guys know I'm always listening to people
who know more than me.
He was talking about using rubber gloves
in the context of hash creation,
how all gloves are not created equal.
First of all, they're not sterile.
If they come in a big box, if they're not individually wrapped
they're not like really clean.
He was also saying how certain gloves,
like when people are making cool Instagram videos
and like quarreling shit and doing shit,
like hell of rubber is getting in the hash.
Like he's tested for it before.
He's used different gloves, played with it
and then send it to the lab
and like got the rubber content back.
So I could see that being super important
on that static tech.
Like if you're just collecting it off
and all the rubber's coming with it,
like I don't know enough, but I know enough to say like,
the glove game is important.
Like they're not all good.
Like, I don't know.
Yeah, definitely quality matters.
Damn near with everything, you know.
Well, the Afghans use static tech too.
I've seen a thing on it the other day.
Like it's not, I wouldn't call it documentary
but like a little 15 minute video.
I think I heard that.
And bro, like that's what they were doing.
Like they were doing it kind of half ghetto style
with what they have, but they were doing static tech
and it was working, right?
And they were throwing away the pile after they cleaned it.
So it obviously works
because they wouldn't be fucking wet,
like betting their whole harvest on it
and just throwing the extra shit away.
You know what I mean?
I wonder if they keep that for a head stash.
Apparently that's what they do for the higher grades.
And like, they'll take that like already like static,
like your pre-run now, whatever the fuck you want to call it
your hash, you've static collected.
They take that.
And I guess that is the crap that they put
in one of the ingredients they use to make
like the really shitty hash that they export out.
Like the stuff that's not quite hash, like it's hash
but it's not quite hash.
There's a bunch of other shit in there.
Interesting.
But again, I wasn't like at the farm.
I'm just watching fucking videos of everybody else.
So who knows, right?
No, that's cool that they have like their own version
of doing it though.
I never heard that in the Middle East and static tech.
Yeah, well, they're using stainless steel.
So they're using a brush stainless steel
to achieve the same effect.
Essentially, they're just fucking almost
like you'd watch someone at a fast food restaurant
waterfall French fries when they're salting.
You know what I mean?
That same thing, but just with giant
like a stainless steel burger flipper
but the size of like a pizza paddle on a short handle.
So like a stainless steel pizza paddle on a short handle.
And they were just, and you could tell
it's not as pure as the static tech.
You'd see like a fucking a heady guy producing his basement
for, you know, five hours really taking his time
and whatever.
But I mean, they were taking out at least, I don't know
two thirds of the material and they weren't throwing it away
and they were gonna do something with it
but they were just fucking throwing it into this.
I don't know.
It looked like a wicker thing with like a lining
and or something like a fucking a fruit basket
giant fruit basket or whatever.
But I mean, they weren't treating it with any care.
Like the other shit that they were taking
off the stainless steel things
that was going into like Turkey bags.
Like what you guys would put pounds in
that those kinds of bags.
That's cool.
You muted DP.
That's fine.
I was speaking Chinese anyways.
You're stoned DP.
Not me.
Hash session.
So check this out.
This is from skunk ape.
This is a turt pearly made
but it is in the shape of a tap root.
So it's like a little thing that has a taproot coming out.
Pretty gnarly.
That's fire idea.
Super creative.
That's super cool.
Right?
And so he even labeled it with like the colors of the glass
as like the cultivar names.
It's pretty fucking cool.
Super cool.
And then let's see.
What kind of gear are you wearing right now?
It's what I want on a giveaway.
By who?
Glass Smith.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
I think it's fire.
Oh yeah.
It's got some fire ass work in there.
Yeah.
It's a little like Kevin Murray ask.
It's got, yeah, it's red chili.
It's fucking.
Oh yeah.
You're right now.
Light shit.
Got the Yoshi condo.
Here's one of the cameras.
It's one of those seedlings.
Yeah.
I seen, I don't remember the artist name.
There's another artist that does.
You got a lot of glass.
Yeah.
There's another artist that does pieces
where it's like an open chamber
and the part where the bubbler comes out.
So it'll just be like a regular like per bubbler
simple one at the bottom,
but then on top of it,
it'll be a seed growing down over it
with the tap roots coming down and shit.
Forget the artist name, but they're super cool looking.
Go bust out some glass magpie.
All right, let me smoke this ball
and I'll pull out a couple of little things.
Tell us a story magpie.
This is cheese star.
This is the best weed ever discovered on planet earth.
This is the number eight.
It's not my favorite, but they're all my favorites.
So it doesn't matter.
Oh yeah.
Sour D.
Fire.
Does it got the loud sour turps on it, Ryan?
That was a fat bone rip.
This one's a sour haze, but it's a,
oh, sour haze.
It's got some sour in there,
but more of the high end and like the gassy low end note.
It's got a little more like a lemony spicy side of the sour.
Definitely not full blown sour D, but it's groovy.
Big shout out to the young paisans
holding down Southern Maine.
Are you going to the honey pot thing?
What is it called?
Oh, hell yeah.
So check out third door,
or third room, third room.
I'm sorry, third room.
Dude's super fire.
It's a note I have.
Go holler at him.
He's super cool guy.
All into the region scene.
He's got like alpacas and stuff that he's utilizing.
Super rad, super sicko.
I love stoners, bro.
I love one of your selling points.
It's like, he's got alpacas and shit you can pet him.
Yeah, you can pet him even.
He takes some of that shit home with you.
You ever pet an alpaca?
You know?
Yeah.
But you ever pet an alpaca on weed?
But yeah, you guys are talking about penance.
There's a couple of bird skull penance
from a woman named Claire out of Michigan.
She's Haskell Youngglass on Instagram.
I'm gonna need you to go find a light, sir.
Yeah, I gotta get a hold on.
Let me turn my camera around.
You've been, you sent out some nice spots
to a bunch of people too.
That's really cool of you, man.
Yeah, well, people have done a bunch,
two people have done a bunch of shit for me,
so I wanted to kind of do some.
That's a cool little simple bird skull.
Yeah, that's sick.
There's another one from the same artist.
This one's a hollow skull.
Oh, badass.
Oh yeah, that one's sick.
And then I have a bubble cap that matches that too.
It's in one of my cases.
I don't know where it is right off the hop,
but I have a bubble cap that's the same kind of deal,
except it's like a perfectly round bottom.
Like, I think it's like a 33 mil or something.
And then it comes up in the same thing,
like you have your air controls with your beak.
Oh, badass.
Oh, and then I got my pineapple from Goose Glass.
Fucking love this thing.
Keep your pineapple, man.
Oh, is that what you wear
when you go to the supermarket for swinging?
Keep it up.
Keep the right side up, magpie.
That's what you want, Corey?
That's for you, buddy.
Yeah, Goose Glass is a super cool artist.
I have a bong from him that's fucking crazy fire too.
A dab rig, whatever.
I like that.
I love the colors on that,
because they didn't all just run together.
Yeah.
That's Goose Glass?
Yeah.
Yeah, that's fire.
Yeah, and this one's in case, so like it's just like,
it's almost like a hard candy lollipop on the inside.
Yeah, I love Goose Glass, man.
He's been killing it for a long, long time.
Yeah, bro, I fucking, he's one of the first artists
that like I got super hype over.
And then I got like my heat as far as pendants go.
And this is a chain made by Brightly Lit that I got back.
Okay.
Back before he was like crazy popping and shit
and he was affordable.
Oh shit, you got multi-colored links.
Oh, okay.
Yo, that's butter, Tretz style.
Look, and you got the, ooh, link.
Yeah, this one's fucking fire.
That's when you get your shit going, huh?
Tretz style, that's butter.
Yeah, this is the one I wear like if I'm gonna go
to like an event or something,
like a glass thing or whatever.
Just be like, I smoke weed.
Yeah, Brightly Lit's a fucking crazy fire.
I couldn't even afford to buy his glass now.
That's dope though, because you saw the passion
in somebody earlier, you wanted to support them
and boom, you know what I mean?
Yeah, there's my matching rig for that pendant
and that curb cap.
It's dusty right now.
That's badass, bro.
Yeah, she's a dope artist, dog.
Super reasonable too.
Like this piece was only fucking 250 US.
Oh, well shit, dude, tell her I'm adoptable, I mean.
There's a simple one.
This one she gave me as a gift.
It's like a simple flower one.
So I told her I wanted just a little one I could destroy
for fucking smoking flower.
How do you like that bucket in there?
Oh, those are dope.
Those are IQ Quartz.
I got a couple 30 mils and a couple 24s, maybe they are.
I'm not sure, this is a 30.
30s are huge.
And then I just use a marble.
This is a 30 mil marble from Skeleton.
I just do drop-ins, that's why they look so pretty.
Oh, hell yeah.
It's a little mini hash pipe from Paul Taylor Glass.
I like that a lot.
Yeah, I like that a lot too.
Yeah, I have a matching rig for this as well.
That's all I have to go with these.
That Dyke Road glass in there?
Yeah, bro, he fucking killed it with the line work too.
It reminds me of Beetlejuice.
Bro, literally.
Smacked it.
Yeah, and these ones,
that's how he sells them is pendant pipes
because technically you can draw the eye.
But I mean, after you smoked a bunch of hash
and you don't really want that rubbing
all over your fucking shirt.
Yeah, you'll be smelling like the fucking.
This is an old school carb cap.
I don't know, maybe eight, nine years ago
from Birdshot Glassworks.
Okay, okay.
It's real simple.
This is when bubble caps first got popular.
This thing was like, when I first got it,
this was like having a Ferrari.
It's like, oh, I got a bubble cap, dog.
I think.
Oh, heck yeah, Mr. Todd.
Mr. Todd said he's smoking out of the gift
from Mr. Magpie himself right now.
What else we got?
I usually have shit laying around.
Oh, so.
There's a little micro rig back
for before micro rigs were popular.
Someone gave it to me as a gift.
That's badass.
It's cool though,
because it's before they started figuring out
the six mils and the four mils.
So this is actually a 10 mil one.
It's crazy.
Rip it.
Well, I have, dog.
For sure.
I believe you.
I wanna see it.
I know, it's crazy.
This one's got like a real nice like light.
I definitely should have found that for a diesel middle.
That's awesome.
That is badass.
The mouthpiece is great on it too.
And the downstem is huge.
This is a coffee mug made by Goose Glass.
Oh, that's fire.
Wow.
Functional pipe.
Okay.
That's cool.
That's super cool.
How long have you been collecting glass?
I don't know, probably like eight years,
nine years, something like that.
Yeah, he made me a little shot glass to go with it.
Oh yeah.
I just used to hold Q-tips.
Is it more difficult to do smaller work like that
or is it make a difference?
I don't think for them,
like if you're talking super intricate patterns, yeah,
but this is like the same prep work
you just put into something else.
Where did you get your Q-tips from?
Satan?
I don't remember.
It's some random Canadian company that came out
when they first started making the sturdier ones.
Cause most of this shit's old just because I'm into it,
but I'm not like crazy into dabbing anymore.
I kind of just like smoking big old chunks of fucking hash.
Grab one of these cases.
I'll show you guys that Goose Glass piece.
Probably my favorite piece, that and the Paul Taylor one.
Got a bunch of shit put away now.
I'm excited to see what's in here.
Me too, man.
Oh my Lord.
The dudes have been popping.
Oh, there's that, hell yeah.
There's that carb cap I was telling you guys about.
It's nothing insane.
I like that.
That's really cool.
That was my favorite out of all those pieces.
There's another one there.
Oh, that one's sick.
My homie's got the matching rig to this.
I got him a rig in red and black to match mine
and she made me an extra carb cap and appendix.
I told her I liked the pattern so much.
That's cool when you have a good relationship
with an artist like that.
Yeah, I just, I can't always just fuck with the same ones.
That's the matching bowl Claire made me
for that flower piece.
Oh, that's fire.
I think it's got like hand, multiple handles.
Yeah, just nice, simple, fucking nice, easy to hold on to.
Oh yeah, Goose Class sent me one of his Millies
when I ordered that coffee cup.
Wow, that's fire.
Chris, is that your shoe hash?
That is amazing.
That's, I've been just collecting Millies lately
and that is beautiful.
Is that a duck?
That's a goose.
That's as clean as Goose Class.
That's as clean as Laser Flux.
That's as clean as Laser Flux right there.
Look how clean that is.
Yeah, man, that's super clean.
Anybody that doesn't know how they do that,
they do that by individual rods of glass that they-
Yeah, like how they make hard candy.
Yeah.
These are super old pieces too.
Birdshot Glassworks when he was first getting going.
Oh shit, that's OG Birdshot.
Wow, man, that's awesome.
Yeah, these are the Groomy Tube series
that he's on right now.
He's got the gummy.
Yeah, this is, but I,
back I was wholesaling glass a little bit at one point.
So I was buying 10 pieces or something like that.
And a lot of these guys,
I was some of their first wholesale orders
just by happenstance.
So this is the prototype
and this is the number one of the Groomy Tubes.
I like the prototype.
I like the little one.
Those are heaters.
That's bad ass, dude.
And then I love it how you can put your own down stem
in there, you know what I mean?
So you can get like three holes, four holes.
Go high.
Yeah, real beautiful translucent type opals in them.
Then, yeah, you get, there's down stems for them.
They each got just like a nice simple down stem,
two hole, five dip.
You're gonna kill the collection, man.
He's fucking killing it.
This is just one of his cases, man.
He's got more.
It's, yeah, yeah, I got more, but it's put away.
Awesome.
What else we got?
Oh, this one's cool.
Like it's just super simple.
This is from a smaller artist in Canada,
but it's just, I just really like it.
I like how it's chiseled and not round.
I just like the glass.
It's like a moss or like, I don't know exactly.
Yeah, it is.
It's a green moss.
It's fucking fire though.
It reminds me of some stuff my parents had when I was a kid.
I don't remember what it was specifically.
Yeah, bro.
Like the old, like fucking ashtrays and lamps and shit.
Yeah, exactly.
It's super simple, but like just something
about this glass, it could be any shade.
I don't know what it is.
It's yeah, I like that glass.
Yep, right on.
And that was just like a random Canadian artist
I ran into at one point.
What else we got in this case?
I don't have any CFL lights in the house anymore,
but this is that to match that piece from Paul Taylor.
And so that's, I think the, this one's called Yoshi.
So this actually goes, if you put it under CFL,
it goes like creamy lime green shifts from that pink.
And then this inside color here,
I believe this is kryptonite.
And I think that's what this one's called.
And this one will shift from that like
stardusty looking purple to pink.
And then it's bottomed out with the same two.
And then it's got that really fucking tight,
beautiful line work with the dichromate.
And it's got, it's so hard to see bro,
but he has the black on green line work inside the dichro.
Oh yeah.
It almost looks like that mask from the pandemic mask.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's badass.
That's badass.
And then on this side, he worked that into clear line work.
So there's lines blended in just with the straight clear,
like many fucking-
I like how he put the sphere for the third eye.
Yeah, that's sick.
Yeah.
It's just like a simple magnification marble.
Yeah, a little marble magnify.
Yeah, that's fire.
I love that.
Yeah, man.
He fucking kills it.
That's one of the,
that's the first artist I ever found
that I was fucking pumped for.
My homie's got one of his original walking sticks
from like 10 years ago that has the mini rig on top.
It's a full six foot long handwork stacked walking stick.
Fucking unbelievable.
This is my, probably my coolest piece in the collection
just because you're not going to see another one.
This was from a charity auction from Goose Glass
about seven years ago, eight years ago.
And he had this pipe series going for a long time
and there were spoon pipes called Opal Eaters,
which was a little goblin just like this, but smaller.
Worked into spoon pipes.
And this, as far as I know, it still is.
This is the only Opal Eater rig he ever made.
And it was for a charity auction.
It's in, it's in one of my favorite glass colors.
It's called Red Blizzard.
So it's that deep red with crushed opal.
And then he left the bottom unsandblasted.
So you really get like that beautiful,
it's like Mars granite.
So that's a fire up his fucking nose.
He left a clear window so you can see the action.
Custom work stem, it's got this crazy,
it's hard to take out with one hand,
but it's got the crazy curve into it.
So it actually functions right
with that crazy curve it's got.
But it's worked, like you throw a 45 in there,
it just works fucking man.
It's got this beautiful, massive cut triangle opal.
That's fun.
I love it.
It's like, it's almost like a,
that's just really deep.
Like that crushed opal just gives you so much depth bro.
Bro, that's what I mean.
And the sandblasted on the fucking,
you flip it over and you see that unsandblasted,
it just pops.
On the sandblasted parts,
you can almost see like ribbons,
the dark, almost black ribbon in it almost.
Yeah, bro.
Bro, look at that.
It looks like stone.
And when you touch it,
like you can feel like the edges of the opals
that are just at surface,
like, oh man, it feels so good in your hand.
Fuck, I love this piece.
That's wicked dude.
Yeah, that's cool.
What's up Chris?
What you smoking on, some shoe hash?
No, I'm actually smoking on this fresh pressed
Okay.
Keith, or yeah, or fresh pressed dry stiff
that Daniel from Donown Farms gave me
when we're over at that summit.
That's what I'm, that's what I'm doing right now,
smoking on that.
And I'm using this.
The hell is that?
I'm using this Bape Brothers.
Yeah, it's got a double chamber.
One second, I'll pass.
I'm using this Bape Brothers.
Official Boneyard C's NorCal right there.
You can get it on dogadotgarden.
You're gonna get, you get the Pam from Down Under.
There we go.
There it is right there.
What I did was I sandwiched some of that.
You said the Pam from Down Under?
I don't know, I don't, I don't know.
I love it.
I don't know.
I'm reeling.
From under Pam.
From under Pam.
Boom.
Show it off with your magpie.
Oh.
We had, we had Chris, Chris's shoebox up there.
No, no, this is not the shoebox.
I was looking at-
This is from a Canadian artist called Borro Cane.
What is that?
It's got a double chamber.
So it's got a glycerin chamber.
So the water's up top
and then it's got a double chamber built in.
It's got gold flake in it.
It's gold schlaga.
Yeah.
And then it's got citron little like stacks.
I don't know, claws,
whatever you want to call them on the back.
He's getting nice too now.
Like this is one of his first-
He's got gold glycerin in the bottle, no worries.
That's decent.
Yeah.
What, you don't have it in yours?
That's decent, bro.
That's so decent.
Yeah, it's so different.
That's why I grabbed it.
I'm like, dog, that's fucking dope.
I gotta get that.
Oh yeah.
Green table, jump on and press something.
He presses a lot of, he likes to do flower pressing.
Yeah.
Shmoozki's.
Oh, like I was saying,
what I did was I sandwiched in some of that dry sift
in between a dry regular herb
and then put some dry sift
and then put some herb on top of that.
A sammy?
Yes, a sammy.
A hash sammy.
Yeah, yeah.
Yep.
So I got it.
Hey, how do you pull up that giveaway tool, Chris?
It's a giveaway thing?
Yeah.
I got you.
See that teamwork makes it a little bit easy.
Dab time.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm so fucking, look at,
I can't even open my eyes right now.
I've been in worse situations.
I'm trying to get into my groove.
Oh yeah, I forgot one thing.
My mom got me this for Christmas.
This is fucking fire.
It's from Spiller Woods.
It's a little candy cane dabber.
That is cool, dude.
He did that really well.
White's not easy to work with, I've heard.
Yeah, the line works crazy clean on it.
I need to get a cell tape and get him to do a show
on here one day about growing.
Yeah, if you guys give me more notice one time
when you do it, I'll put in the work to pull it out.
I probably got like three or four more cases like that.
They're just put up and put away.
I definitely have a couple artists too
that would be down to come on live
and do some glass blowing.
Yeah, I know a couple that might do that too.
Now that you mentioned that, if I asked them
and we made it ahead of time so it's not a rush thing.
Yeah, yeah.
I got a homie that's like 10 minutes away down the street.
Fire.
There you go, brother.
That's dope.
Yeah, literally did it.
Send a private chat.
Yeah, closest I got anybody is Toronto.
It's like maybe 25 miles, something like that.
So it's not too bad.
I got lucky actually met this guy like two days ago too.
That's cool.
Yeah.
I thought he only worked with soft glass.
Thank you, Peter.
No, that was me.
Yeah, I know.
I said Chris helped me out.
You call me big Peter.
No, he didn't.
No, I'm just kidding.
Big Petey.
Yeah.
Petey.
Well, let's see.
Let's do a hashtag skunkgate for a giveaway.
We're gonna do a giveaway for this marble right here.
And it's counterpart that I had right next to it.
Right next to it.
Right here.
Get up here.
All right.
You look fucking faded, bro.
Oh, look speaking.
Which one?
Fucking DP, bro.
It looks like he's gonna die.
Oh, yeah, DP.
DP forgot he was on.
How big is that marble?
How big is that marble?
Like 25 mil, maybe?
30 mil?
Shit, fatty.
Fire.
Oh, Peter's got the Nintendo Switch going.
Hell yeah.
Yes.
Ladies and gentlemen, Peter has entered the room.
Whack in the face.
Oh, oh.
Whack in the face.
What are the different sizes?
Because you use them together.
Let me get the giveaway thing going.
Peter's getting abused right now.
Hashtag skunkgate.
That's what happens when you breed.
They get violent for a bit.
Start.
So you gotta go to add.
Got it.
If you want, you go to add it to the screen
and then you add it to the screen.
You go to add it to the screen
and you add it to the screen.
Yeah, there you go.
There you go.
Are we doing a giveaway with everyone
that's live right now?
That's everyone that's early?
All right, so check it out.
Everyone watching.
Everyone that's watching.
Yeah, everybody that's watching for sure.
No, it's just for us on the channel.
Everyone else is shy.
Yes, yes.
Everybody else is shy.
Pick a number, guys.
Pick a number.
Everyone watching, vote who's gonna win.
In the meantime.
Vote in your number who you want to win.
Most votes get the marble.
It's dabbing.
I'm saying I want a marble.
You want a marb-skies?
I love that marble.
It's bad-ass, bro.
Yeah, it's an impl-
Are they both, is the smaller one an implosion as well?
I literally have like just-
Same exact colors.
It's same set.
That's dope.
And I'll find the pillar that goes with it.
He also has a pillow.
What type of set is that, Corey?
Say it again.
What type of set would they call that
when you have the two marbles?
Slurper set.
Is that what it's called, Corey?
Yeah, I didn't know that-
Can't snap it?
See that, bud?
If you set it up right, I'll knock it down.
Listen, dawg.
Just tell DP you're gonna break his arm.
Yeah, everyone's gotta say
hashtag skunk ape in the chat.
You, if you wanna do it.
DP is just lost, bro.
Take a deep breath, dawg.
Get a glass of water.
Ash, bro.
That's it.
Hey, I saw it being made.
Is that the one that was just freshly made
just the other day?
No.
Yeah, it's still hot.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
I remember it.
Or I thought I saw it.
Slurper.
Slurper.
Slurper set.
Slurper.
Say, give me that slurper.
I'll come over there and bust your fucking head.
Oh, man.
I'll go ahead and use it now.
Give you a live demonstration.
Bro, you're breaking in someone's stuff, you dirty girl.
Oh, you can sit on this.
Oh, yeah.
That's something that people don't realize
until they're in the glass.
Everything you buy has had someone else
to sweep the tawny.
Even if it's brand new, that guy that's selling it,
you know why he bought it?
One, to sell it.
Two, so he got to take a dab at it.
Oh, man.
Got it, let's go.
I have all kinds of those on my IG if you go way back,
back when I was selling glass,
like really high-end pieces that I could never afford to buy
but I can afford to middle at the time.
So I get to smoke them for like a week
before they went out to the next person.
Whoa.
There we go.
There we go.
There you go.
So let me tell you about this device right here.
Tell me about this device.
This Vae Brothers thing, my wife really likes it.
She says she likes even better.
Nine out of 10 wives recommend it.
Better than Gabby.
Nine out of 10, this is wise.
Then what?
So it's a lot easier to use.
I know, you're that sacrilege you just said.
It's a lot easier to use for people.
You just pack that little thing right there,
put it right there.
Can you put hash in it?
Can you put hash in it?
Yeah, I put hash in it.
Dust it all melt in there.
Oh yeah, it's nice.
You probably just go up to.
Yeah, I mean, if you're gonna smoke hash out of it,
it's fine, but if you put weed in it.
Yeah, it's great.
What temperature does it go up to?
Oh.
7 million.
I think it goes up to 700 degrees.
700 degrees?
Celsius, it'll melt your fucking whole house.
What temperature are you smoking your hash?
I'm doing right now, I'm doing three quarters of the way,
right around there.
We're all tripping on acid when I was in high school
and this kid came over.
I think he's awesome.
He's the only one not tripping on high school.
I think he's awesome.
For an acid and he went and put his finger in there.
This is really old school tech,
but I like this a lot better than the Volcano.
I don't like the Volcano because it has that, the bag.
The bag's so annoying.
This is so much better.
Bro, you never walked around a party naked
with two Volcano bags, you're everybody's friend.
You crazy.
Jesus Christ.
One full of DMT, one full of hash, stop it.
Let's go.
You don't tell people which one is which either.
You just offer up, be like, pick a fucking hand.
Let's see, what do you got on there?
You got 24 people on there right now and there's 75.
Dude, what are you guys doing?
Are you, oh, it's like, are they 24?
They might not, they might not even.
Maybe they're not, maybe they're not slurping.
They might not be slurping.
How do you tell if people are watching?
Because they have like multiple devices going.
This ain't no weed or anything, this is a fucking marble.
This is a marble, big old marble, dude.
Yeah, you can eat it.
Who doesn't want this?
Can you eat it?
Don't eat it.
We're gonna leave you not to eat it.
Yo, don't, it's a fucking dude, bro.
Oh, okay.
Let me put a needle in one.
How else do you keep your shit safe?
Hashtag skunkade, hashtag skunkade.
And I think DP said he will send it
all the way around the world and back to you.
He said if you're in New Zealand, he got you.
He's got the money.
Who said it might take me?
You might think it took twice around the world
before it gets there.
You better remember this.
Just like committed him to like a $475 freight charge
for a marble.
For those of zines.
Jump off, Azoli.
Cheers.
Yeah, Azoli.
He's a hasher, he squishes.
He's a squisher extraordinaire.
Alex Hardy has over 25,000 marbles.
Okay, there we go.
Come on, guys.
What?
Hashtag skunkade.
What collection?
He's a collector, bro.
What is his Instagram?
I wanna know his collection of marbles.
I've lost mine.
You might have a...
You have to hashtag skunkade in the chat to be signed up.
I'm gonna hear your Instagram, Alex Hardy.
I need to see all these marbles, man.
I'm a collector.
I love marbles, man.
Grandpa collecting marbles.
I love marbles.
And then put in hashtag clam chowder
if you want Corey to recite a poem.
With the red sauce or the white sauce?
The white.
You saw skunkade?
Skunkade glassworks said,
all good, I'm gonna send the winner a new set.
Wow.
What did you do with those marbles, bro?
DP was over those marbles.
DP, that means you're sending me back.
Yo, DP's contaminated, bro.
He got the Ronald marbles.
DP's over Skunkade's rescue.
He's like, go away.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Oh, you know what?
I'm gonna take that.
Maybe that'll get...
Basically, Skunkade's saying that you tainted his marbles.
He's not happy about it.
I was like, hey, I'll save the day
so people will actually fucking sign up for this thing.
Don't worry about it.
You're not gonna get the ones that were in DP's mouth.
You'll get...
I was gonna show you guys my marble collection,
but I can only show it every Tuesday.
I'm just worried where they have really been.
People worry about the wrong thing.
They're worried about the wrong thing.
It's not up to me.
Because they put marbles other places, too.
Well, those are beads.
I mean, those aren't marbles.
This is the hash show.
It happens.
This isn't the hash church.
This is the hash show.
All right?
So let's just...
Okay.
We're not held to a high standard here.
Nah, I got you, Skunkade.
We don't matter.
And DP invited us.
So, Peter, if you're listening,
if we say anything collectively
that's inappropriate or upsetting,
DP gave us the link.
Yeah.
So we're all on the same page.
He knows.
I'll start dabbing, too.
I'll get...
Fancy booty beads.
That's what I'm talking about.
What?
Who needs some plastic anal beads?
Bro, there's all kinds of artists making that type of show.
I know.
That's what I'm saying.
I'm sure there always has been,
but it's going through a wave right now.
Y'all saw the rigs made out of them and shit?
Yeah.
Brightly Lit's making hilarious ones, bro.
Check his page one time.
I'm not going to do that.
I like that, the mofo.
I let it get too cold.
That's why I need that dab right, it has the alarm.
What do you need?
Karen.
Is there a seat option on Instagram?
Yeah, you already know, dog.
I need to get the...
Honestly, I want to get the new Dab Right Pro with a tent up.
Yo, that thing's wild.
It's right there.
Bro, it's so wild.
Where you just like dab right, bro.
It's not on par.
My dab right's like off like 85 degrees.
85?
Do you have the first version?
Yeah, I have the first version.
We were like at a session a couple of months ago
and a buddy had a Temtec
and he was like, you want to see how much yours is off?
And I was like, let's do it.
I just put, we put his right in our mind
and switched it and off 80 to 90 degrees.
Like I was like, wow, that's effed.
Like, so I've been taking dabs for the last,
like however, no so long, just extremely hot.
Yeah.
Why is Chris right there?
I don't know why that happened.
That's some fancy shit, bro.
I still take dabs like a Jedi.
Heat the shit up, I put a drop in in
and I just hope everything goes well.
Like a Jedi.
Yeah, I just do it by feel, by feel.
By the vibe, you know what I mean?
You can feel the vibe.
I'm like those, I'm like those vibes.
Those vibes are about 585.
I feel like it's like sweat and a joint,
you know, when it's time to hit it with the fucking saw.
Yeah, yeah, exactly.
That's what I mean, you just got to do it enough.
It's all, it's like trimming, it's like trimming weed.
It only sucks until you have to do it enough.
And then it's just like trimming weed.
You really don't even mind that much that,
like I'd rather sit down and trim weed
than go work somewhere else to tell you that much.
Yeah, but I mean, when you got to trim weed,
like after you got home from work and like,
Oh yeah, yeah, nah.
Yeah, learn to love that shit, bro.
Yeah.
Fire.
All right, well, cheers.
Marvel set.
Wow, crazy.
Look what he's looking for.
DP is now forfeiting all his responsibilities.
Yeah, Skunk Gabe said send me a gift pack
to give away a flower cap.
A flow cap, a flow cap.
Winner can take their pick from our next to last.
Wow.
Wow, that's crazy.
I will check it.
That's awesome, man.
I got to hit Skunk Gabe with a flower right now.
Yeah, I've seen him in the chat a bunch of times.
I don't know if I have a flower.
I need a marble right now, man.
Skunk Gabe, you hear me?
I'm gonna hit you with a flower right now.
I'm gonna hit you with a marble.
I'm gonna hit you for a marble right now.
Wow.
Cory, just get something to eat, bro.
You look so lost and confused, man.
I am, I'm fucking lost in space.
I need sugar and carbs.
That's what I said, get it, bro.
I know, I'm gonna do it.
Get some of your fucking foul-tainted coffee ice cream, bro.
Hey, be nice.
I am being nice.
That was the nicest way I could say it.
Yeah, everybody heard that.
This guy eats coffee ice cream.
Terrible.
But then he had pralines and cream, which was-
Hey, hey.
Something like that.
So you can't fuck with that either.
What a piece.
Oh, but a pecan Puerto Rican.
I like it.
Needs to happen.
Had too many dabs, no ice cream.
See it, let's see it.
Oh yeah, that's a fat, that looks fire.
You gonna snort it?
That's what those dabbers always remind me of.
You gotta get it out of the oven with no cold steam.
You still get the steam on it.
Okay, okay, okay.
Oh shit.
Oh, Chris got extra allowance, dog.
Oh shit.
The black mama.
He stole somebody's lunch money.
All right, so if anybody doesn't know,
you gotta go hashtag skunkate.
Type it in the chat, just hashtag skunkate
to be able to get that Marvel set.
I'll put it back up here, catch my breath.
Still coughing.
And hashtag clam chowder if you want Corey
to read the poem of your choice.
Hashtag American if you want me to read it.
I broke my beads.
I need to go buy new beads.
Oh dog, you can't pull too hard.
There's still a couple that came off at the first knot.
You gotta go to the hospital now, bro.
Dude, you know how shit like bounces in the air
and then it like disappears?
I'm talking about turt pearls.
Yeah, those turt pearls.
He didn't say pearls, he said beads though.
That's all I'm saying.
No, you do.
Apparently, I don't know.
I know that one looks like a pill.
The doctor calls them obstruction.
What's the one that they call the one that looks like a pill?
I don't fucking know, a piller?
The one that looks like, yeah, is it a piller?
A piller, yeah.
I'm pretty sure, correct me if I'm wrong.
Yeah, the longer ones?
Yeah.
Pillar, and so the other one's called a pearl,
the little ones?
Oh, turt pearl, man.
I don't know, dog, I'm not fancy like you guys.
I don't own any turt pearls.
41, that's better.
He's got suitcases full of glass.
He says he's not fancy.
He's got fucking gold water in one.
Ladies and gentlemen, let's give a warm welcome to Harding!
Alex, what are you doing?
What's up, man?
I figured I'd fill the request to see marbles if I can.
I'm gonna see if I can.
Nice to meet you, Alex.
How y'all doing?
When are we running this?
When are we running this giveaway?
What?
How long?
Ew!
Yeah, that's you guys' deal.
Yeah, DP, how long until we run this giveaway?
I think we should wait until there's 60 people at least.
Yeah, no, 10.
Okay, give until there's 60 people.
Yes, I agree.
I'm trying to figure out how to turn my camera around
because I want to show you guys these cool marbles.
Okay, what do you do is you go into settings
and then in settings or in more,
you go into camera and then in the camera,
you do front to back.
Close, close.
Oh, here we go.
It's a phantom.
Front facing back.
So camera two, three.
There you go.
I can't breathe.
Nope, wrong one.
Cool.
I'll find it.
Oh, here we go.
There's my feet.
All right, marbles.
Holy crap.
Woo!
This is all marbles.
That's a lot of marbles.
Wow, look at that.
Yeah, you got some vortexes, all sorts of good ones.
Oh my God, dude.
So yeah, someone made me some modern shit for me
because they knew I was collecting marbles.
Local glassblower is probably some famous guy
who I just like, I don't even know,
but it's got the-
Rick and Morty.
Yeah.
Yeah, Millie.
But yeah, no, there's literally,
I was trying to get better light in here.
And-
Oh my God, dude.
So here's like a money plate right here.
Let's see.
Oh my God.
Pull this out for better.
Little miniatures.
These ones all glow in the dark.
So I have, I got a huge pile of them
that all glow in the dark.
Holy crap.
This is what I call Pelletier company.
So these are all from like the-
You aren't messing around, dude.
No, no, these are some,
everything on here,
everything on here is like $25 to $300.
Jesus Christ.
Careful, put it back down, dude.
There, that's called a Superman right there.
A little mini Superman, that's it.
So this is what kids played with in the,
before we had colored television.
Basically, I think I was like the last generation
that played marbles.
Look at that Tiger one.
Look at that Tiger Strike one.
That's sick.
Yeah, Tiger one's sick.
When I first started collecting,
I got some of those and I had no idea what they were worth.
And I sold them to a guy who resold them
for way more than,
you know, you learn those lessons, right?
100%.
And some of the most expensive ones I've had were,
I had one that was-
You had milky ones?
Milky ones, yeah.
There was one that was,
it was an old German handmade
that was probably worth about $3,000.
And I actually had been,
this woman sold it on eBay.
She was in Oregon and driving to like Louisiana
and stopped here and I freaking,
she was gonna sell them to me for cash and I bought them,
but it turned out that somebody in my marbles group
on Facebook had been the person who had already bought them
and she was like ripping that lady off.
So I got and recovered,
basically stole material and returned it
to the lady that already paid for it
and didn't charge her extra for it.
But that was a kind of a neat thing.
Kind of funny, but yeah.
So it's a bit, I wish there was better light in here.
There's jars and boxes and,
so a lot of this stuff though,
it's not so valuable.
And eventually what I wanna do is fuse them.
So I use this thing actually as a display
when I'm showing them.
I'll set marbles and then put it in the perfect light
and zoom on them.
Classic, like cropped over glass, right?
Ideas, yeah.
But the funny thing is like literally
one of the ways I got into it,
two things happened in a succession
and it was, I got this table
that was made by an autistic great uncle of mine.
And I grew up with this
and it was in my grandmother's house when she passed away.
And I got this as part of my inheritance
and pretty cool.
So it's all marbles from the forties and fifties, right?
And at the same time I had,
let's see, I'm going back to camera here.
See if I can get myself back on the,
there we go.
Should be me.
All right, there we are.
I got in the dabbing
and it's closed settings.
There we go.
It was looking for a marble and got on eBay
and bought just some plain glass,
plain marbles of the larger size
and started using them as like a dab cap.
And then I found I could buy marbles like crazy
and really spent some time getting into learning
what all these are
and the different antique manufacturers
and the styles and the colors and all that stuff.
And it's pretty complex to learn it all,
but it's pretty fun.
And you can actually, if you, once you learn,
you can go to like an antique shop
and find marbles that are worth money
and pay a little for them and resell them.
But anyhow, you guys said you wanted to see them
and I'm just, I wish I could get better light in there.
I have one option.
I'm gonna try and run down the garage and find a spotlight.
I got the, if it's charged, it'll work.
While we got you,
we heard you talk about static tech and stuff before.
You wanna talk a little bit about that?
It's a matter of fact,
we're walking right into my workshop.
Oh, I saw something hanging up there a second ago too.
Oh, okay.
Yeah, I don't have it set up to work like that
at the moment, but I'll turn around.
I'll show you what I've done in this.
I'll see more settings, camera.
Look at all that fine cannabis.
Literally, just take it all, see it.
All right, so got your brushes.
Let me close this down again
so I can see the screen that you're seeing.
All right, there we go.
Yeah, so this is not,
I have been doing,
I've been doing other things, but yeah.
So I'll have cold plates.
And right now there's a little bit of run over
because what I did was all of my low grade hash,
I just went ahead and put it in jars
and did an isopropyl draw on it.
And I'm just making that into consolidated.
But we talked about gloves earlier
and sometimes it cakes on
and sometimes these little gloves will wear off even, right?
They start cracking and shit.
But definitely what we got,
we were talking about different gloves.
There's vinyl, right?
And there's nitrile.
All right, and so you wanna make sure
that depending on what you're dealing with that stuff,
vinyl is the rubber.
And silicone even too, totally slowly.
But this one here I've been using for a couple of years
and it doesn't wear down that fast.
And so dry sifting over,
standard 110 inch art frames, right?
These are my dehydrators I use.
I have a little wine cooler for when it gets warmer.
And I've got a big old dehydrator from-
It's nice and cold here in the garage.
It stays well below 50 for months on end,
but like it's freezing, 35 degrees in here right now.
So that would be my original,
one of my older silk screens.
And somewhere around here is my little teeny one
I've had for 30 years,
but this was drying bubble through on a towel.
And down in here.
So I use a silicone brush.
This is what I'm using when I'm dry sifting.
When did you first learn about dry sifting?
Who were you watching?
Who was your kind of mentor, like around what time?
My first dry sift would have been learning
through High Times Magazine
or the old book hardback covers that we had in the 80s.
And I first bought my very first silk screen
when I got to college in 89.
So, and that's, yeah,
that's how long I first started doing it.
And I met my mentor around 2000
and he taught me what he learned in Morocco
about the drums, right?
The drum tech on the, they use a screen.
I've done it where I've taken a silk screen
and you put it on.
You built it.
Yeah, so I built a lid for,
you kind of do it in reverse on the bucket
and shake it out.
But there's all sorts of ways you can,
and they're using a specific set of genetics
and screen sizes, all right?
So, but here's the 110 art frame standard.
And then underneath I got the 230 threads fringe.
So, and then my, yeah, again, my mentor taught me
and I was working at pretty good.
And then I wanna say seven years ago,
encountering Frenchie is when things started taking off
and getting better and better.
And then learn stuff from him and Bird,
the two people who got my hat perfected.
So I can take, do I have anything?
I have nothing here besides some,
but hanging behind here, hold on a second.
All right.
Oh, it smells so good.
So.
What cultivar is that?
Who's your mama?
Which is a nod to sub cools.
Who's your daddy?
So I just took a whole bunch of elites
and reverse them all together.
It's really crazy.
Also, so really awesome response,
but so you can just dry stuff like that.
You can see it sticking to my hands a little bit
cause it's warmer.
If I had a, if I had a glove on,
we would be doing this and it'll actually,
maybe even jump up on the sides of my hands.
We'd have the glove on it lines up on your fingers there
and you brush it off using the brush.
I don't have my screen,
my little folder down here, whatever.
But after pushing it through the 110
or bouncing it through,
that's like the very best dry sift
is just bouncing it through.
And I've already corrupted it beyond
what the best dry sift is.
And we'll look and see,
just there'll be a little bit in here
and you can see there is just a little dust from that.
Yeah.
Wow.
Awesome.
Okay. So, but half of what's there is like stems,
stocks and stuff too.
Here we go.
So you shove all that shit down through
and the good stuff is what sticks to the glove
in that section is really where the best is at
as far as I'm concerned in the dry sift.
And then what comes out on the bottom
down underneath in there is,
I'll go ahead now.
I'm just drawing it out with alcohol,
but I got a nice little bit of hash on my hands there.
And that's not what I ran out here for.
Was it?
You guys asked me that.
And, oh, I was coming out here for a light
for the show to see Marvel.
So we got double dose, right?
Cool.
And let's see if these work here.
We got these little fuckers
to play volleyball at night.
They're great.
This one gonna kick on.
I might not have a charge in either of them.
Let's see.
Oh, sweet.
So we got light.
Cool.
You guys are awesome.
There goes the caps he wants.
You're awesome, man.
I really appreciate all you do for the community.
Yeah.
No, we'll look at some marbles.
And as long as I'm here,
we'll break out a little hash in there.
Got two, let's see.
There we go.
All right.
So these are like modern,
what they call Appalachian swirls.
So there's still guys in Kentucky and stuff
that do this stuff.
And there's all sorts of glitter
and glint and stuff in there.
And I've been having the hardest time.
I'm trying to remember the freaking name
because I saw it in some of your glasswork there.
But there's a name for the green sparkles, particularly.
But it's different kinds of metal and stuff they put in them.
Mm-hmm.
Look at that.
Look at that shit right there, right?
And these aren't even clean or nothing right now.
They've been sitting in the closet for a while.
I haven't polished them up or nothing.
But that one, it looks like the ocean bottom, right?
Some of that stuff is just.
All right.
Little miniatures.
There's a ceramics clay glass.
These ones here glow in the dark.
Glow UV, I'm sorry.
More modern.
Moderns, I would give those away when I sell them.
Put them in a sander or a rock grinder
and smooth them out like they're at the beach.
Big ones.
Here's some more.
Which ones are your favorite?
Some of my favorites,
definitely these Pelletiers.
They're amazing.
These guys right here,
these guys right here,
these are Dave's Appalachian Swirls.
They're pretty awesome.
Those are pretty.
They're newer too,
but they're mimicking the old school ones.
Jabo Company.
They're so, they're all packed away.
There's, there's,
shucks.
This guy, okay, right here underneath,
let me move a couple of things here.
Underneath these, these little,
these are, these are Cambridge glass
from like the Depression era,
these hatchets, right?
And then, but underneath them,
all these marbles come from one dude.
And I got this guy's high school yearbook
and his,
and his container.
So they're, they're not super clean at the moment.
I got his crayon that he would use to mark the,
the circle on the ground with and stuff.
But some of these here, these,
these are worth a hundred bucks each and stuff.
And some of them, it's nuts.
And I keep them like as a group
because it's like some of these are from the 1800s.
Because it's a chunk of history.
And most people would like buy the group
and then just sell off the expensive ones.
And I'm like, how do I keep these not doing that?
So I decided just to like stop selling them off.
And again, here's these.
This is another one from a single person here.
That was their whole group that they played with.
And then I'll just,
my daughter knows that they're, what they are, right?
And so when I'm gone,
she knows to not just throw these out or let them go.
So there's,
yeah, so, oh, so yeah.
That group right there is worth some coin.
And old, there's the oxbloods.
There's the oxbloods.
This one here, all the different varieties,
different like from Moki marbles to stone
and Indian blankets.
How did you play when you played marbles?
Like how we did it, we would take one of those big ones
and kind of toss it across the room.
And then we would try to doink it off the big one
with the smaller ones.
You know, that's one of the ones we play.
And I remember playing and trying to knock them
out of the ring.
And if you couldn't get them out of the,
like knock one other one out of the ring,
you lose your marbles
and the person that knocked them out got to keep them.
And then there was one I remember playing was a hole.
These are all Civil War clay marbles there.
You put it up like a hole in the ground.
Civil War clay marbles.
So these ones here.
Pete's.
Wow.
That's a whole lot of history in the cup.
Oh yeah, yeah.
No, I mean, there's all sorts of like,
this stuff here is like handmade in Germany, right?
Like in the 1800s.
And came across a boat and stuff, right?
And like a lot of these ones are,
so early America and first companies in America
that were making these things, a lot of this stuff,
there's only like two or three companies
in the early 1900s.
I'm going to move this plate here and sit down.
One underneath it's a bunch of stuff
that was actually dug out of the Bosch.
I think Bosch and all, let's see.
So these are American made here from,
these are all just ones I really liked out of,
as I get them, but they weren't super specials.
So again, this stuff here was all dug up out of the,
like the Bosch glass factory plant,
which is now at the parking lot.
So like old mid 1800s, 1800s.
Will you turn your phone sideways?
Thank you.
There we go.
Sorry, thanks.
No, wow, wait, those are from the 1800s right there?
Yeah.
Are those ones in a Frisbee?
This is a beautiful piece of glass work.
Oh, cool.
Wow, look at that, yeah.
So-
Is there any way you can like hit it up
with a torch or something to bring it back to like shiny?
Or is that-
Well, so again, some things like
when you collect antique stuff, like coins,
sometimes cleaning them isn't what you want to do.
Yeah.
Right?
And so-
It's a bad old, yeah.
For instance, like this one here called the Superman,
this little red, white, and blue one in the middle there,
that's could be one of the most valuable ones
in this entire group, except for the fact
that I polished that and that makes it worth the worthless.
Okay?
Except for my own collection,
and I know I have one of those.
Wow.
So it was all broken and chipped,
and I'm able to do that with a rock polisher.
Let's see if I can, let's see here.
So you can see it, it looks like it's all nice and new,
but it would have been completely all mangled and roughed up
like it had come out of the beach or something
when I started with it.
And so that was using like a rock polisher,
vibrator thing, rock tumbler.
And so like they start out a little bit dull
and they move forward,
but I don't see any broken ones right off
to say what I would have started with really.
Unless that stuff's packed away in the recess.
You could start collecting marbles.
This happened after my grandma passed.
This would have been,
it would have been like four or five years ago.
I just did like a two year hardcore deep dive
into this stuff where I totally got into this daily
spending, going through offerings online.
I'm sorry?
This is two to four years of collecting only?
Oh no, I only did like a year and a half
of actually collecting.
I spent like four months deep diving
like I was going to college,
learning everything I could about it.
I bought books, I joined Facebook groups
and I studied the same way.
After I'd been teaching like hardcore,
teaching cannabis, organic growing
in the Probiotic Farmers Alliance, like nonstop,
I really needed to change a fucking pace
and I needed to learn something myself.
And this is what I did.
I got into fucking marbles and became the student
instead of the teacher.
And I knew that there was masters just like me
that knew the glass and I studied it.
And I bought like sets of broken glass
that were worthless to learn the actual glass.
And yeah, just got the same way
like I would deep dive in the art
where I got back into painting.
I just got a bunch of oil paint
and just started smearing it around.
And anyhow, yeah, there's a chunk of change in that closet.
Very groovy collection.
That's awesome.
Passionate man.
It's really cool.
Thanks for sharing that tech on the hash too.
Yeah, sure.
That was cool.
It's hash, that's what it was about tonight, right?
You guys gonna give that thing away?
Yeah, we'll do it.
And then also so check it out.
Remember, hashtag skunk ape, put that in the chat.
Hashtag skunk ape, hashtag skunk ape in the chat.
Skunk ape.
And you're gonna go ahead and get this marble set.
Boom, we get over here.
I think he even said he's gonna give a t-shirt too.
Yeah, he'll do t-shirt.
All right, so if he's gonna do all that,
he sent me a picture, we'll do this.
This is what we're gonna do.
All right, check it out.
Look at that.
Yep, then he sent me a picture.
So let me find how to pull it up real quick
and I'll pull up the picture that he sent me.
And thanks Peter.
Hey, what's up?
Photos, here it is.
Boom.
I got something with lemonade and I got cotton balls.
I like the German ones the best,
the set that had all the various sizes.
There was like three or four sizes in it.
Right, there's, you know, if I had time,
I got them all set there,
so there's like a lot of work to keep the dust off of them.
Right, and so like right now I only have like one.
Turn this around, I think you guys can see this.
One little set that I keep out
and it took me a couple hours just to clean the other day.
That's pretty.
So that's my marble set.
I'm trying to pull it up real quick.
Just learning how to do this real quick.
There we go.
Yeah, the marble set that Skunk Ape's gonna send out.
So he'll do that with a T-shirt of your size.
We'll just find out the winner real quick.
I'm gonna find out how to pull this up all the way.
While we're waiting, can we get our pronunciation?
Slurp a set.
All right, so that's gonna be
what you're winning right there.
That's a beautiful set of Vortex marble right there.
That'll fit any quarry, hit it.
Slurp a set.
Slurp a set.
Skunk Ape, what millimeter marble is that?
Is that 20, 25?
So yeah, we'll do the giveaway.
Good luck contestants.
Yes, good luck everyone.
All right.
That's weird.
How do you comment?
How do you get the comment, Peter?
If I tried to do hashtag Skunk Ape,
it fills out Skunk Ape Glassworks.
That was happening to me as well.
You have to like click around.
It's kind of funny.
It should still work.
How do you even?
I just did a couple of spaces after.
Let's see.
How do you put a comment on the, you have to,
you need a second device.
Yeah, that must be new on YouTube,
that the ad sign and the hashtag
both auto-fill someone's username.
Yeah, that's still not to me before.
All right, well, we got 51 people.
Let's go ahead and give this thing a whirl.
Here we go.
Shabooskies.
Good luck everybody.
Yo, where's me?
Where's Peter?
Peppa.
Oh, oh, oh shit.
What's up?
I'm polished.
Yeah.
Damn, so close, Andrew Getzinger, so close.
Hit me up on IG.
I know him pretty well from the community.
We ran into each other.
Congrats.
I'm about to wash his sour melon that he gave me.
He gave me a seed of sour melon that I grew out.
We're about to wash that, so that'll be fun.
Oh yeah, congratulations.
Just hit me up on IG.
I seen Peter's name in there five times.
I like everybody to know that.
I saw it in there five times.
That was ridiculous.
I did what?
There's like five accounts in there of yours.
Different Peter picture.
Ah, even now, me.
Brady wanted that set.
All right, well my-
Congratulations.
What is, ah, that's one of the chillums.
Nope.
That's not.
But it's also, we've got a broken down the different,
let's see here.
It's cold right now, so it's solid.
But this is totally melt to my fingers and everything.
And so this is the 9150.
And then I have the other ones off the side.
And there's one more.
This is hash.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But one of the things, I was thinking in chat earlier
when whoever was showing off their beautiful melt
that they had on that clear plastic,
that if you separate it out,
you would have like dabble,
the 150 and 90 and the other ones are more malleable.
I mean, you can see the, this is a 90, 70.
Let's see right there.
Shit, the second piece.
I hate this backer.
I'm dyslexic to start with.
Sorry, folks.
No, we can see it though.
That finger.
All right, sorry.
Boom.
No, it's okay.
The different sections.
We see there's the smaller sections,
the big main section,
and then it goes to the three smaller sections.
And the one in the middle of the two smaller sections
is the smallest.
Super.
That's the 150 to 90 right there.
And that's the 90, 70.
And I'm sorry, but I think that should be,
there's 70, 40.
And I think this one's 150.
Cause I don't use the 25 bag anymore.
This is just clay.
Right?
This one's all frozen.
Yeah, yeah.
So I got other stuff out.
It's like dabble.
I'll tell you.
And then this would have been.
You don't like Temple balls, do you?
I think I heard you say.
No, I love, I love Temple balls, man.
But so one thing I've learned is though,
I'm starting to wrap it and put it into like this instead.
So that would be a huge Temple ball, right?
And depending on the grade and stuff,
my higher grade stuff, I'm just not,
the air exposure and stuff,
it degrades it and loses the turps, right?
And so the higher grade stuff,
is it, I was putting it in the jars
and doing this jar tech.
Where you freeze, not even freeze it.
You put it in the fridge and then thaw it out,
put it in the fridge and thaw it out.
And it would,
it just melts.
And I whipped it once and let it cure, right?
And so that's,
that's fresh frozen,
150 to 90.
I'm down with that.
It's a mixed, it's fully dabble.
You get a little, you know,
it's not like it's rosin,
as far as what's left.
But let me get a little scooper,
to show you what it looks like when I scratch them.
I'd fight you for it, Chris.
In the nose is this super fruity, earthy.
Love it.
Yeah, I wish we had a microscope,
so we could check it out with the microscope camera.
Right?
Yeah, it all recrystallized and then it melts and stuff.
It's crazy though, but that's what,
and then the one thing I've done better than that,
is that's fresh frozen,
is taking the full live plant,
and washing the full live plant.
That just is so,
I can't keep the keys from melting at room temperature.
So, that's why I stopped making temple balls,
so much into putting it in this slip wrap,
and put it in the jars.
And I'm done.
Did you notice any turf separation with the jars?
Oh yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's why I'm experimenting with these other tools.
I've got jars going,
all sorts of them.
And so here's the temple ball,
and I'm trying to do,
see what happens with this temple ball on the jar versus,
but it's not,
not all stuff.
So, it's actually, it's vacuumed,
because it goes cold.
Right?
All right, just get the piece off there and smoke it.
How old is that?
Again, it's cold, so it's solid.
And I can't, right?
I've got stuff out.
And again, this is a secondary wash
after I'd already dry sifted it.
And so it's not this top notch.
But I was able to form that with my hands,
without any heat.
Okay?
And so that's something I want to impress is,
I'm not using hot water bottles.
If I've got to use hot water or any heat,
I actually do have this nifty little gizmo right here.
It's a vulcanizer.
And,
I'll just warm it up and fold it a couple of times
into itself.
It's fast.
Mark it for me, dumpster.
Let's see.
Y'all still there?
You are?
Yeah.
Yeah, we're supposed to go.
We're in the cold.
We don't want you to see your hands, man.
You guys want to see me smoke ash?
I got, I have my little heady hat set.
I just got rid of one of those you just showed us.
I don't want to pull the spice off of each one.
I've got all sorts of,
here, here's some 150.
We'll melt some cold 150 on it.
So, I'm old school and I don't have all that neat
rigs you guys are using.
We'll come down here to my dirty bong level.
It's got clean water in it.
I ain't scraped it in a minute, whatever.
I'm busy being fucking crippled mostly.
If Gummy Bear's watching, it's okay.
Take a deep breath.
It's going to be all right.
You can get yourself sick, dude.
You got to clean that bong, man.
Yeah, what don't kill you makes you stronger.
So, on the base, I have the Breath of Red Dragon S1.
Oh, that's beautiful.
Is what I have for my flower base
tonight on the bong, or this evening.
Nice.
Tonight's up, 15-0-D.
Is that available on Dagadog Garden?
I think, I got a restock over there.
Yeah, yeah.
And,
I think it is,
That would be nice.
That one might still be there.
I haven't restocked anything in a minute.
I need to start sending shit over.
I've started my Etsy page,
because there's only 25 things on a dog,
and I still have 150 other things, right?
So, but working didn't work out,
so I got to get the seeds out there to folks.
Yeah, make the world go round.
Well, I think it's dab time.
Peter, what are you dabbing on?
Cheese.
Hold on.
It's Puffin Solventless's Sour Diesel.
Okay.
Breath of Red Dragon.
There it is.
Yeah.
My battery's dying.
I got to go find my cord.
Are we getting these on Doggadog?
It's going to leave us hanging.
Yeah, I'm pasting it.
Oh, yeah.
There it is.
Peter.
Are we going to get this on Dogga?
If I talk to him, yeah.
Were they going to call me?
Yeah, he was supposed to call you.
I'll text him and everything, but yeah.
It's great.
My wife loves it.
Oh, yeah, and hold that up too?
Yeah, we'll...
We need to get that.
Yeah, I reached out to them.
So it just keeps it cool and fresh?
It's a thermos.
Yeah, okay.
Corey, can you say that word again?
Thermos.
Hey, I got one for you, bubbler.
Yeah.
Fluffa.
All right, dab time.
Oh, okay.
All right, I'm going to...
Peter, this is from Corey.
Nice.
Yep.
How'd that make it across state lines?
Allegedly.
Yeah, allegedly.
No, I went over there.
That's why DP's so lit.
I was over there two days ago.
You went to Maine?
Yeah.
Wow.
I went over there to hang out with Corey.
We fucking ate lunch, had a hero high five over there.
A grinder?
Yeah, no, he tried doing...
What's a grinder?
It's Italian goodness.
My favorite hashtag.
Oh, the sandwich, yeah.
Excellent.
I love a grinder, I know.
Yeah, I was looking at property up in Maine.
We only use mills here
because the mill is the real deal.
Get your mill.
We got the fresh flour mills right now
with the DAGA, with the FCP on there.
Go get them today.
Epic.
I've had hashtag, what's a grinder for years now
because I've never used one or a flour mill.
Who was the artist for that flour mill?
Yes, we don't grind, we mill.
Oh, that's a weird dude.
Who was the artist, Chris?
Do you know who the artist was for that mill?
I think the artist was DP probably.
Oh, you got it?
No, was it?
Yeah, it was, thanks.
There it is, there it is, there it is.
Oh, I was gonna do it.
There you go.
What, I got it.
I just ran inside to go find one.
Oh, hell yeah.
I didn't know you had them in hand.
So groovy.
Yeah, they just came in.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hold on, hold on, we're gonna switch off.
Here we go.
Shaboom.
I am.
Oh, that's a good size too.
Can you give me the bigger one?
Yeah, this is the bigger one.
This is bigger than the other one.
Yeah, Peter, when I see you tomorrow,
I'm gonna need a T-shirt and I'll need one of those.
I like that, so all the size queens that we have.
I need a couple of these.
I may like freaking hit the big one.
There we go.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Nice.
I'm gonna need one of those.
Shut up.
You're making it all possible.
With the shirt on too.
That's right.
Yo, that's fire.
Yeah, I just placed my mail order today, Peter.
I think you got it.
That was sweet.
Yep, I got a couple of T-shirts.
I'm going to that-
For this one?
That Northeast Cannabis Conference next weekend.
So I got a T-shirt so I can walk around and rep.
Hell yeah.
Is that the Northeast Cannabis Conference?
That's gonna be bad ass.
Yeah, out in Boston.
I'll be there Friday and Saturday.
Is it called Northeast or is it called the New England?
Is it New England Cannabis Conference?
Did I say Northeast?
I'm sorry, I meant New England.
New England-
They're both technically the same area.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But I was like, is there another event?
No, no, it's New England.
New England Cannabis Conference.
And is it at like the, like is it big?
Is it at the Heinz Convention Center or like-
Correct, at the Heinz.
Yeah, at the Heinz.
Oh, wow.
Yep.
Yeah, so I'll be heading out there.
That's cool.
From Bio, I will be there.
I wish I was in Rhode Island.
When is that, next week?
Yeah, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, 10, 10, 11, 12 of March.
Interesting.
Yep.
Peter, are we going?
You know, I wouldn't mind going.
No, I'm not going to go to the Northeast.
So likely, here we go.
Any of you Mainers wanna take a ride down?
Peter, send me with a camera, Peter, I'll go.
Come meet me out in Boston, I'll be there.
Yeah, I wanna, like Spanibus, I was like,
if I didn't have three kids and wasn't overwhelmed,
I'd be in Barcelona right now.
Yeah, literally, if I wasn't moving,
that's what I said, if I wasn't moving right now,
that's why I set up for next year.
My lease is perfectly ending right in time for Spanibus.
What hash is that, Hardy?
I think it's Breath of Red Dragons from two years ago.
It would have helped, this would have been a temple ball
two years ago, and then we just melt out that flap, right?
And eventually it gets to where I can handle it
a little bit more, but when they're fresh like that,
you gotta let them sit and kind of cure,
they recrystallize, and then this one meted out
and everything after a while, you know,
I carried her in and been smoking on it slowly
all along there.
So it would have been probably like a 20 gram ball
when it started and it's down to two grams.
So it's really neat, I've been paying attention to
and really digging is looking at the different densities,
the different weight mass density of various hashes, right?
Some stuff is like really lightweight for volume
and others are denser.
So like pulling off, like cutting cheese, right?
You can't really just pull off and say that's a gram
or like dough, same kind of thing.
You get to know your dough, your hash,
and trying to figure out the volume weight size
is kind of neat.
Yeah.
So what would be examples of things on both extremes
of the density spectrum?
Oh shit.
You don't want me to really answer these questions,
I'll be right back with the stash.
Some dense stuff and some light fluffy stuff.
Yeah, we need visual illustrations.
I like the studio setup.
Yeah.
Oh my goodness, it smells so good.
You smoking now, DP?
Bake it.
Again?
Oh yeah.
You didn't even know how long I was gonna be looking
at my screen there.
Yeah.
Day in the life of Alex, we're excited.
Gorda.
Is it a term I've heard used
from the Pakistani Afghani folks?
Gorda, Gorda, G-U-R-D-A?
Referring to the loose stored resin heads, right?
The unpressed hash, that you store it like that.
And then, like a lot of times you'll see,
people say it's okay, so it's not hash
until it's pressed and rubbed.
Did you see me, it was kind of hard.
I was trying to show what I was doing,
melting it, rubbing it with my finger,
dropped it in my bowl.
And so, like some people would say
my temple balls aren't hash
because I don't use any more heat
in my hand to melt them, right?
And so there's a difference of agreement on that, right?
But my understanding is the traditional sifters
in Afghanistan, Pakistan, they're melting it
right before they use it.
The same way we just showed
and Phil was doing earlier tonight.
We've got that stuff and it's been sat around.
And so it can turn into that,
depending on its density, if it'll melt,
the cold, the warm is how I've gotten it
to just melt out completely in the room.
And I didn't really bring so much of that up.
I have that down below.
These are old, old garter that's been sitting forever.
This one here is labeled 2018.
So this is super, super low,
super low density hash right there, right?
And-
Do you see a difference in the effects?
Oh, this stuff is aged.
I don't know so much the effect.
That would be a whole different thing.
I have to line up and try and figure that out
and have other people around.
But heating it up and pressing it, right?
Would make it more dense, but this stuff's gonna like-
Oh wow, that just instantly greases up, yeah.
Yeah, and then with a little flame to it,
again, it gets all melty,
but it's just totally just sticking to my finger now
and it needs to go through the process.
That looks really nice.
Right, right.
So here's a fresher dry sift Temple ball
of Dr. Dream Olive here, I think.
And then maybe a secondary one.
So it's dense like a rock and it needs to cure out.
And the really high grade first run of that stuff though,
it just goes flat in room temperature.
Okay, I got this.
I gotta get the lid off.
Okay, there we go.
So, gosh, I wish I had that chunk.
There's one down on the cover that is like a highly pressed
but still low density.
It's kind of weird.
Let's see, I'm just looking through to see what I got here.
There's so much, so much.
What I got left of the Kevin Jodre weed
I got over at the summit.
Bam, bam, bam.
What's it called, Chris?
I'm smoking some right now.
What's it called?
Some of that pressed.
Press.
I'll be smoking some hash with Elka.
I'll open some hash with Elka.
63 grams right here.
That looks like some nice.
Nice Elka.
That looks nice.
You're making me jealous.
I think you're making everybody
in the audience right now jealous.
That's crazy nice.
That looks so nice.
I wouldn't even be able to dance in here all day.
I'd fall out.
There's no way.
You know BP's adoptable, right?
Yeah, right.
This is Breath of Red Dragon 2020 greenhouse
gifted 321.90 to 70.
So this isn't even the high grade
as far as I'm concerned.
This is my second grade.
Where are your money pots at?
What do you like?
I don't sell it.
I mean, no, not like that.
I'm saying like what's the green size?
150 to 90 is the one that I showed
that separates out that says that just like
to me is like always the one that just goes full melty.
Right, and that's pretty close to the same thing
with that 110 and 230.
I'm kind of in that same.
I think it's closer to 70 and not 230 though.
And then maybe more like a 140 on the 110.
But that's the,
I'm sorry, I'm skipping back and forth
with microns and threads per inch there.
I apologize.
So the ones I showed you in the garage
are all threads per inch.
And then if I run it through a bag, it's.
So for anybody that didn't know,
so the screens you're saying are a different size micron
or thread counter, however they're counting there
the size of.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So those ones I broke up that flower
and smooshed it around my hand there,
that was a 110 thread per inch, not 110 microns.
And so if you go to an art store to buy a silk screen
is basically what I learned on a perfected dry sift
first drop on with just a basic 110 thread per inch.
And so you can make some of the finest hash in the world.
But if you saw a hash search this morning,
they were talking about, and I was agreeing in chat,
2% compared to what you're gonna get out of a wash.
And then one of the things I like to emphasize too
that I'm finding so much of is the stocks
can be half of what you get
when you do that first 110 thread per inch.
Or even if you're washing plants
that have been dried and cured,
you're gonna get stocks in there and that's gonna,
it still melts, but it's not necessarily
that really good stuff we wanna be hashing with,
or you can clean it up and make it better.
Somebody said when I was showing what I was doing with that,
somebody typed up about cooking
and you can tell the quality of a cook
by how much waste there is from the original products
that they started with to produce the meal.
And I'm finding more and more of that.
It's like, okay, so I've ditched the 25 now.
It's a waste of time trying to get the water
to go through that and all it's left in there
is literally clay.
And I don't know what it is
and there might be a good purpose for it,
but I don't have it.
Somebody might and somebody's doing something with it.
But if you're not utilizing it, I mean, it is what it is.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, I've got more than,
there's so much that comes through here.
It's such a saturated market everywhere
and we're like a hub where so much gets transported
and then we have all the ski resorts,
people go off and come back
and people go off and start farms and come back.
And so everybody knows somebody with a farm.
And so it's not like I don't pass off,
I don't sell much flour or ash or anything.
Have you been working with any type of minor cannabinoids?
TCV is in some of the stuff,
my sativas that I work up, I'm sure,
but I don't have access to testing or anything like that.
I'm straight living in the freaking,
in the dark ages.
I've got a right to utilize plant medicine
and heal people and turn people on to the first amendment.
And, but there's no structure for me to be permitted
and go through the other permitted
structure facilities here.
I haven't had money,
so my body's broke down pretty bad
and I tried to get a job, it was paying well,
but I can't keep up with the workload
they need me to anymore and just make the money.
So it's like, oh, that ain't so cool,
but yeah, so I got to get back to
marking some seeds and pipes and things,
my hands fucked up and it fucked up at work
and they're not fixing it for me and it sucks.
So I kind of need my hand to make a living.
Even doing this stuff, stirring the fucking bucket,
my arm don't work the next day
cause it's pinching the nerve in my hand, right?
So I've got a lot of un-done washing and stuff
even this year.
Bump right here that pushes down on my nerve.
Yeah.
And like I'll get a shooting pain down to there,
but my biggest thing, how it messes with me is like opening,
like opening a jar or even opening a door,
turning the faucet on, just that kind of stuff.
You know what I mean?
I can't open my front door with my right hand.
I got to use my left hand.
First time ever, one of my big olive jars are,
I fucking had to put it between my fucking knees
and use both hands to get the fucking lid off of it
cause my right hand's losing strength and shit.
It's been going on since November
and I had two MRIs.
I had, you know, the doctors just like,
oh, just keep stretching it.
And, but they took me right off the fucking work
with a schedule and didn't give me a light duty work
and trying to get, I'm in a red state.
So the corporation, it's called the right to work state,
which means, you know, you can't have a union.
So.
I grew up in Georgia and stuff.
I'm a big fan.
It's, that's not what we're here to talk about.
No.
We're here to talk about.
I'm gonna plant some spinach in my pots.
Nice, nice, nice.
Yeah, I got my first food garden started this week.
What else did I get?
I got some lavender because I heard lavender
is a good natural pest deterrent.
Yeah, it's also really, really nice essential oil
for all sorts of stuff.
I put it in my topicals.
Oh yeah, cool.
It's a, it helps calm.
What's up, Bird?
Hell yeah.
Basic part of it, yeah.
Anybody wants to come on, talk about hash,
smoke some taps, come on on, throw a link in there.
So Corey, how long ago did you get that process
from Mission?
Oh, he's not even right there, I'm sorry.
He's out looking for snacks, though.
Snacks.
I just smashed some sherbet real quick, that was fire.
Eddie, Karen, where's that big ass jar at?
How far have you gotten yet?
Hell yeah.
Not very.
Not very far.
And then I don't even know, I guess the,
I'm supposed to go pick up the 1500 more grams,
but the kid is, I don't know if the kid's flaking or not.
Yeah.
What is that one?
This one's a Jager ice cream hash.
But I don't have the size on it.
It's a, I quick pressed it, so it's,
it's good little wafers.
One of my favorites, I didn't bring them up,
there's a, I got a whole nother pile down
in the fridge there.
It's all my twists.
Here's one that's super high density.
The lettering came off of it.
Just a fucking chunk.
Right on, Toad.
Glad you like it, man.
Mr. Toad right here.
Corey, when did I get this out of the, from you?
I don't know what you're talking about.
It could have been Friday.
When the fuck does mine show up there, Corey?
What the fuck, dog?
What are we doing here?
I left Maine Friday.
How long ago did Mission Hill do this?
Probably a month ago.
And they gave it to you, you cured out, right?
I don't know what goes on, honestly.
I don't, like I told you, I don't,
I don't know, no clue.
It was, it was as you see it.
You did a great job, man.
This is one of the more complex bickets I've ever.
It gets you fucking ripped, too, that's the key.
Yeah, it definitely does.
It fucking, I love it.
All bickets do, but not all bickets
have this complexity of like.
But that's what I like about it.
Like, if it could have all the complexity in the world,
if it didn't get me high like it does,
I wouldn't give a fuck.
I hear you.
Here's a dry sieve temple ball.
And like you say, it sticks to the plastic.
And so, it's one of the reasons I've gotten away
and started putting them into that slick wrap into the jar.
Because you do end up losing turf on the plastic.
I sent it out to my first wife in California
and she's always like, just sends me a picture of plastic
with like, it's smeared on.
I was like, oh, I'm gonna send some more.
I'm looking for the different twists and stuff.
And I do wheel and twist and.
DP.
It's just like automatic.
I'm like, hey, Chris, can you blow up?
Eat it, DP, fucking eat it.
I dare you.
If he eats it, he's gonna have to auction it.
I dare you.
Wet dream.
You eat it, I'll take a half gram dab.
You're gonna have to take a dab with a teaspoon.
This is, no, I'm not eating this shit, y'all crazy.
You'll have to do a dab the size of the Fico glob.
Bro, it's like the size of a fucking ad.
Stop it, just swallow it, do it.
You'll be the most committed marble collector
if you can only visit your marble once a week.
I'm so fucked.
This one right here, this is the hardcore
from the Gorilla Grow.
It's just.
And that's the 150, 90 again.
And yeah, yeah, yeah.
It smells all earthy chocolatey.
It's so.
It looks like something covered in chocolate.
Looks like something.
Yeah.
That looks like that thing, oh man.
It's like this.
That looks like.
It's like you're in sleep.
The different grades there.
It's a.
Great.
We smoke this in when we have parties
and remembering hardcore.
But right now is a good time to do that too.
So I'm gonna.
No reason not to smoke a little hardcore hash
while I got it out.
Let's go.
Dutch Blooms, look me in jeans.
I got somebody to hang across the room here right now going.
Yeah, I'm popping a bunch of Larry Chimes F2
to run outdoor this year.
I'm fucking pumped.
I got from Dutch.
I got a dosy liquor.
I got two of those going.
That's some.
Nice.
Some wild shit.
Yeah, the backpack that I ran from Tony,
the females from Dutch and that shit killed it outside.
Now one of the keepers, I kept him still running for a hash.
So I'm the ones in the flower room right now.
Oh, shout out to Baked Banana Bread Co.
It makes fantastic.
Yeah, bro, how is that?
Infused.
How is it?
It's really good.
Are there nuts in it?
Nope.
No nuts?
This one's actually a strawberry banana that he did.
I need that.
Limited edition.
I need one of those, dog.
I need one of those.
Made with all food grade hash.
That's fire, yeah, that sounds really good.
What's food grade hash?
Stuff you're not putting in that well.
For me, it's everything.
Everything that's not the 150 to 90.
For some people, yeah.
Some people will go 70.
Some people will go down to like the 45,
depending on cultivar.
Some people are even saying they'll find shit down at 25
on like some weird cultivar,
but it's a pain in the ass to get there,
like you said, Hardy, you know,
like to even go through all that shit.
Like, it's a lot, so.
The Belvia got some of the smallest heads I've ever seen
and it all stopped in the 45.
Yeah.
I believe you 100%.
I do.
That banana bread is delicious, though.
Well, and I use the microscope to look at the stuff, right?
I'm not just like, oh, it didn't get behind,
there's just two, there's none there.
And yes, it's a pain in the butt
because it traps those little micro holes
and the water doesn't pour, and that's the slowest.
I'm working with natural cold
and it's usually like between 10 and 15 degrees outside
and trying to clear those buckets sucks
when it's that cold and going super slow
and that's just everything starting to freeze up
because it's clogging on the small.
That's sweet.
Where's that from?
Is that a, who is that from?
It's a GHK.
You're on mute, Chris.
You forgot how to talk.
He wants us to see something
that I don't think we're gonna be able to see.
It's a signed piece, it's a Matt Glass.
Matt Glass, all on Instagram.
Purple and green?
Yeah, he does all kinds of,
this is a classic pipe right here.
I like the wig wag.
Classic style pipe.
He does all classic style pipes.
Like, his pipes are awesome.
Let me show you, just in case you guys haven't seen them.
I know I've showed my pipe before,
but this is stuff is next level when it comes to.
Yeah, cool, thanks.
This is Narvi here.
This is Narvi.
Narvi Peace.
Happy 420 New Zealand, what's up?
920 here.
So who's that piece that you rip out of all the time, GP?
That one in your head.
Oh, this one?
This is.
This fine specimen right here.
All right, here's this guy's stuff right here.
Check it out.
Not from this guy.
There's mine right there.
This is what this guy does.
Does all classic style pipes.
That's epic.
He's got the layout
just like the classic wood curve pipe companies too.
That's fucking awesome.
Yeah, I love it.
Like, look at this.
Oh, that is bad.
I'd buy, if I had a.
Can you buy that piece?
Can you buy that poster?
I want all of these.
No, but is that poster.
I want this long one right here.
I want the church warden.
Look at that.
Oh my God.
I got the Duke, I think.
Damn, I want the poster.
This is bad.
100 years ago, like that was it.
Everyone had pipes like this to smoke the tobacco out of.
Yeah, this pipe was made in here.
Let's see.
Let me go back to the.
My pop was a tobacco pipe smoker
and had had Marishems and several of those styles
on his pipe wheel.
But they're all like old.
Yeah, this one right here.
And stuff.
These are beautiful glasswork copying the.
This is a Don style pipe right here.
And there's me right there.
I got it at this place right here.
What place?
The place that's Jay Friendly.
How much, how much was it?
You don't know what it is.
It's either fire.
Oh yeah, that's it right there.
The place with the guy with the eyebrows, DP, you know.
The guy with the eyebrows?
Yeah, that's, yeah.
Who made your piece, DP?
I was very patient.
I'm about to pull it up right now for you.
Oh my God, just use your mouth and say the words.
Is Hugh made that?
H-U-M-A-D-P-E-H-A-T.
Hugh made that?
Yeah, I'm about to pull it up for you boss.
DP, Pharma26, do you have an answer to that?
He asked about blueberry chirps being,
let's see how he said it.
Uh.
Would the panel know if blueberry chirps are volatile?
Yeah, that client there is fire.
Right there.
Volatile for washing in general.
Blueberry chirps are volatile, you're saying, Corey?
I'm sorry.
He's asking if blueberry chirps
are volatile for washing in general.
I'm not sure to tell you the truth.
Usually it seems like the more rancid,
funky ones flash off quicker than the fruity.
Yeah, the gases and the OGs and stuff.
It's really hard to get those.
Fruit flavors tend to be kind of capturable,
but I've never even had enough
of something a blueberry to try.
So I can't say myself.
I would smoke my blueberry flower.
Yo, this guy's about two hours away from me.
Yeah, that's fire, dog.
I like those, bro.
Like the little hovering clients he's making.
Those are dope.
Yeah.
The skinny necks.
Woo!
Is that the one you have there?
Yeah.
That's fucking fire, bro.
It is a bad ass.
Is it faceted on the lip or does it just look like that?
On what lip?
Like on the lips, like on the hanger
and on like the mouth.
Yeah, right on the joint it is.
It's faceted on the joint.
Damn, that looks fire.
Yeah.
And it's in cow mode as well, which is pretty dope.
Yeah, the uncow mode.
Yeah, he snapped on it, bro.
Like he hadn't made a hanger in a long time.
So I was like, reached out to him
and I was like, yo.
Yeah, bro, the classic banger hangers are dope, man.
They're fucking nice too
because they don't fall over and shit.
That's right there.
Yeah, that's fire.
So I got to go out there and kick it with his,
in his garage with the torch and everything.
It's super dope.
We'll pull up Skunk Apes real quick.
How about that too?
Hell yeah.
Those are beautiful pieces, dude.
Yeah, I haven't got a chance to look at his yet
but I followed him earlier when we were talking about him.
Let me ask you, are his pieces affordable?
Is that like piece right there, that first one,
is that like a million dollars?
Nah, you're probably gonna spend probably around,
probably for that one.
I don't know, to tell you the truth, I don't want to.
I mean, I don't want a discount.
I just.
I just.
You pay, you pay.
I understand, it's just, I'm so scared
to break even this piece at $240, this piece right here.
Yeah, oh yeah, you're around there and stuff.
All right, so here's the one that
I got from him from Skunk Ape.
Yeah, that's dope.
Or one like this.
I don't know if that's the very one but.
Yeah.
Beautiful.
I love this, look at that.
Oh yeah.
Yeah, a little sidecar marble and shit.
Look at that, you got Vortex right here on it.
Yeah, it looks like a sidecar but it's a dry hammer.
Ooh, you got the pew.
Put that in your sauna.
Did he already sell that one?
Oh yeah, dude, you're fucking.
Molly whooped somebody, for real, for real.
He already sold that one?
I don't know, you'd have to ask him.
They'll always make you one, bro,
if you see something you like.
Yeah, for real.
As long as it doesn't say a one of one, not for sale,
then they'll reclaim it for you.
I got that one, shaboom.
I love it.
That's my favorite one that I've gotten from him.
It's just so deep.
The Vortex goes so fucking deep.
It'll pull up that little Chelum
that's like two on the right from the one you're on now.
Right here?
Yeah, yeah, a candy cane looking Chelum.
That's so cool.
Good work that he does.
So he layers all that.
Oh, I thought it was a Chelum.
That's his son, he's a badass man.
They're so cool and friendly.
They're really good people.
Big love, Skunky.
So I always like that he has a...
It's a seal, Chris.
Yeah, all the accent marbles.
I love these.
Rico won, it's a pendant.
Yeah.
He had gifted me one that went to a giveaway for Rico
during a charity auction.
Yeah, go up a little bit.
Go up a little bit, bro.
A little bit on top right.
What do you think you're doing, running the show over here?
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, middle right.
Middle right.
Right here?
Middle right, next to the glow in the dark one.
Yeah, what's that?
Yeah.
That's just a Chevy, bro.
That's just like a...
You know what I mean?
That's like if you're cruising back in the Chevy.
Yeah, that's what I was talking about.
That thing's fire.
That's what I was trying to talk about before.
It's like a little...
So I got one of those down at my parents' crib
when I'm down there and stuff like that.
It's pretty dope.
I love using it.
I love using it.
Yeah, that's dope.
So yeah, y'all see anything?
Oh, see there?
Shaboomskies.
The turt pearls.
They're little seedlings,
which I thought was really unique.
Yeah, those are cool.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
Yeah, I like how he rounds out his mouthpieces too.
So it's like not a tiny little inverted hole
where all the resin's gonna collect.
That's a cool idea too.
What's that, Chris?
Yeah, I like that everyone's getting into the faceting.
I'm still getting into the faceting, Pat Ross.
The faceting makes everything look so fucking fancy.
It really does.
Like you get fancy and you get the fucking faceted slurpers
and shit.
Slurpa.
Slurpa.
Slurpa.
Slurpa.
Slurps wicked high.
Wicked high.
And he probably thinks we just are talking normal to him.
No, I just.
No, bro, I already told him a bunch of times before.
I'm not even making fun of him.
I'm looking up to him, bro.
He's like all the guys in the movies when I was a kid.
It's fucking awesome listening to him talk.
Yeah.
Fucking guy.
Oh, it's a compliment.
Take it as it is.
So in Afghanistan, Pakistan,
you have the traditional hash smoking
where they got their, gosh,
I can't even mean what they call their,
it's like a clay tube they stick into,
kind of like a base.
And it's a bomb of sorts, right?
And the top has got a bunch of charcoal they stick in it
and they roll a bunch of fucking little balls
of hash onto it, right?
And then they'll drop some more charcoal onto it and cap it.
You talking about the one they put
the cotton rag on the bottom?
You know, there's several different variants, you know.
I watched this guy Baba and then our friend Nazarian
who's different people.
And I get different stuff just comes through my feed.
And then, but one thing that,
just like using hookah,
they're using hardwood fruit charcoal.
And you notice here, I'm starting,
I'm like harking away with my mutine.
I've been thinking about this lately.
And I'm thinking of my starts,
like making hardwood charcoal for smoking hash.
What type of wood?
Little bit of burning charcoal in there with it
and it keeps it going.
So you've got an ember to keep it bubbling, right?
Just in the bowl, traditional old school stuff.
I see everyone with their torches.
I don't own a torch, right?
I do have a new nail, hardly use it.
But I wouldn't mind one of the hash pipes
for the holes are up on the side of the bowl.
And you use a rod, you heat the rod up
and stick it down at the bottom of the bowl.
And the smoke comes up to the holes on the side.
Yeah, the quartz rods ones.
I've been looking at those too.
It seems like a cool idea to smoke it
without wasting it all and having it melt right through.
Cause even if you triple up the screens,
it'll still melt.
This thing here has like an antechamber going down.
And it's got a-
I'm gonna get water.
It's got a-
I'm gonna get water.
Cut garnet for a screen.
Oh, that's a good idea.
But there's a little cup hole down at the bottom
and it just gets both.
It's like, smoke has water in it,
but a step of full weed down bottom
and all the resin clicks and you don't really get any ash.
So it stays pretty clean in there,
but there's still tons of hash melts down into it.
And definitely,
you never, it's like you never seen it at all.
Yeah, no, that's what I find with like my pipes.
So like, no matter how I try to smoke it,
like it'll, you'll still end up melting
a bunch of the top grade right through.
All right, chat, here we go.
We got another giveaway.
I'll pull it up real quick.
Type in hashtag bubble cap if you are a dabber
and even if you're not,
it would be a dope ass piece to hold anyways.
Cause okay, it's gonna-
No, you're not.
Only dabbers can have this number.
So Alex, that's what this is.
Hashtag skunk face or hashtag-
That's what this is.
One of those hash marks.
And hashtag clam chowder if you want Corey
to read the poem of your choice.
Here we go.
Let's get it.
I just got this 500 million year old rock.
I got two.
Boom, let's go, let's go people, let's go.
It'll be decent.
Oh, big John, I just got your message.
Cheers.
I need to grab a drink.
That's all lowercase.
You want to do it exactly like it is.
Hashtag bubble cap.
Let me get that back up there for you.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Right there.
We'll do that.
Boom.
For this.
Shabooskies.
Yeah, those are bad ass.
Shabam.
Hashtag buggle, buggle.
No, bubble.
Can't talk.
Bubble.
Bubble.
Bubble.
Boom.
That's what's up.
That's my luck.
I'm not doing it.
I don't want to throw mine in there.
I'm going to be like,
I'm going to be down there.
I'm going to let you get up.
I got to get on the hit, man.
I'm getting,
I'm getting the shakes.
I need my torch, man.
This fucking window.
It's got to be the god damn motor.
So the Heady Baron,
what's your favorite method
or way of consuming your dabs?
Do you like a traditional banger?
Do you like your knot?
Do you like a slurper?
Personally?
What's your go-to when you get a brand new jaw
and you're like, fuck yeah,
I can't wait to hit this.
Slurper for sure.
That's what's up.
Load up a club.
What about you?
What about you?
What do you like?
I like slurper because you can go through a nicer size one
to get the full range of like the,
right when they're burning off to like the low end as well.
Instead of it just burning through
and it just getting like burnt, you know?
100%.
Yeah, I definitely like slurper.
But is this how you feel all the time, Corey?
I feel super old right now.
Hey, Megpie.
How about this?
My daughter uses a slurper.
That could be worse.
That could be worse than you saying.
You see this, brand?
Get it.
This shit's fire.
What's that?
This guy knows how to fucking grind, man.
Use your word muscles and say it out loud.
Is it ice out in your mouth?
How do you say it, Chris?
Everyone wants to show things on the tiny screen.
You gotta use your mouth, Chris.
Read it.
Left to right, top to bottom.
Come on, do it.
Like we all agreed upon.
Yeah, it's massively agreed upon
for like quite some time now.
What is this?
What is this?
No, we don't want your OnlyFans shit.
We want the hash.
It's fun with food, 420, if anyone wants to know.
Hey, is Peter still on?
He's always here.
If you say his name enough times, he'll show up.
Yep.
Hey, Peter, I need a favor.
That order I placed today for the order for Jonathan,
you can process that ASAP.
I'm trying to get that shirt for Friday
so I can take it to the show
when I go to the Canobie show out in Boston.
If possible.
I think he was here when you were telling us about that.
I'm sure I'll get it.
Listen, we have somebody in chat asking
if crop seed, if seeds are any good.
No, don't do it.
No.
Don't do it.
If you need seeds, go to dogadotgarden.
I'll pull it up for you.
Just so you know that there's so much fire over there
and they are what they say they are.
They're not some random ass cross
with some company that just bought out a bunch of shit.
What are you doing, Chris?
Hey.
He's fucking burning Uncle Ample a little bit.
He's back on a little bit.
I'm holding my hat so it's through this flame.
Hey, DP.
What's that?
I'll be back on a little bit.
Okay, yeah.
Peace out, brother.
Thanks for coming on.
Peace, guys.
It was nice meeting you, homie.
Yeah, nice meeting you, man.
Have a good night.
Spare a piece, guys.
Good night, guys.
This Gushmintz cross of soda looks super fire
from Sticky Richie.
Gushmintz.
Gushmintz.
Sounds shady.
That's fire.
Just sounds like prom all over again.
It's all right.
It's Gushmintz.
That's what I'm saying.
Fire.
Oh yeah, I saw this guy on with Tony and Peter
the other night.
What's that?
You did what with Peter and Peter?
Just like that.
That breeder you were just talking about
was on with Tony and Peter the other night.
They were talking to him.
Who?
I forget what his name was.
Sticky Richie or something like that.
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
That was a great one.
That was wonderful.
That's what it really is.
You know what I'm talking about?
Your question, I mean, you're a comedian.
Yeah, did you see that?
Work together, don't work against me, man.
Did you see that, man?
Tony's giving out, he's giving out a free 10 pack.
Oh yeah.
From Underpin with every single.
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
He sent in like 100 of them or something.
Yo, you wanna jump on and talk about that real quick?
Take a dab with us?
If you're able to, I understand if you're not able to.
And he's got it right.
If they ain't on Daggard, they ain't legit.
He told me he doesn't like Chicago,
so he's not gonna come on DP.
That's cool, dude.
I understand Chicago's a fucking.
Yeah.
The Bears, the Bulls.
Not everybody can love it.
Not everybody can love it.
Every time someone says Chicago,
that's what I think about.
The Bears, the Bulls.
The Bears, the Bulls.
The Bears, the Bears.
The Bears, the Bulls.
Cheddar, you fella hasher.
Cheddar, you working?
He likes Chicago the band, though.
Oh, whoa.
Oh man, I had no idea it's been on for three hours so far.
All right.
Good hat.
I got love for Chirac.
I can't wait to get out of here, I tell you what.

What's up, man?
What up, homie?
Hey, Joe.
What's good, Joe?
What's up, Joe?
Nice seeing y'all having fun.
I was just watching.
In the back there.
But yeah, I seen everyone.
You're from underpant.
Yeah, from underpant.
Tyler sent me a bunch of stuff last year
prior to the season to work with,
a bunch of seed packs and some clones.
And I pulled out some Pam F2s
and hit them up with my space cheese mail,
the from under mail.
And I'd send in 110 packs to Daga
so that anyone that picks up any packs of my gear
will get one pack with any pack you pick up.
Along with all the freebies I usually send in,
the three packs that are for any order, not just mine,
but you can pick up anything.
Peter usually sends something in with one of my three packs.
I just wanted everybody to know that.
I seen you guys were all in there
talking about good gear.
Someone asked if Crop King was good.
I can't tell you if they're good or bad.
I can tell you if they're not on Daga Garden,
probably not where you want to be.
Boom, baby.
There's tons of good.
Good breeders on there.
Oh yeah.
Hashtag bubble cap.
Let's get it going.
We'll do another 10 minutes and we're gonna call it.
I think I'm done.
I think I'm done.
And Cheddar was just doing a-
I'm just doing my, you should be getting them, man.
They just got there on Monday,
let's see, a couple of days ago.
So yeah.
Cheddar was doing a fundraiser.
I didn't know he was doing one this evening,
but he's doing a fundraiser, I think for one of his friends.
I know he's doing one the last-
He has a cult today.
So if anybody would like to be able to help for that,
reach out to Cheddar.
And-
Yeah, they're auctioning off some dope seeds too.
Yeah.
Yeah, they got some good seed over there.
Marcus Gavin, you're in the right place.
Cheers.
I'm about to smoke some of Corey's fire ass
razzin' off the Bickett OG that he grew.
I feel real fucking left out, Corey.
It's cause you live in-
Dude.
Oh wow, so we're gonna be racist again, are we?
Went up to me.
It's not racist, it's just impossible.
Listen, toss it over the fence, just throw it really hard.
Then go stand by the fence, dude, I'll be right back.
Just throw it over the fucking fence.
Bro, we just got trained on a pigeon or a cannon.
I don't know how to catch it.
Then she smack it over that motherfucker
with a hockey stick.
He ain't gonna know what the fuck to do with it.
Find a Canada goose, attach it to its neck
with a GPS tracker, it'll find its way back.
Canadian geese, they hang out down here.
They don't even go back to Canada no more.
It's too cold up there, dude.
Bro, we get them all fucking worked up
and then they go over and terrorize you guys for a minute.
They terrorize people down here, bro?
Yeah, it's hilarious.
They do it here too.
Can you please take those Canadians up there?
They're rude.
Dog, those are the champions of ornithology, right?
Barrel-chested Canadian eagles, right?
That's a damn gruesome of a course, dog.
Out of a rig that was simply made by Mr. Magpie.
I was gonna say, where did that sweet-ass rig come from?
This came from Mr. Magpie.
And if you guys look real good, it's hard to see,
but there's a dream catcher inside of there, man.
This thing's nice.
Yeah, it's cool.
It's got a little mini marble with an opal in it.
It works, it's awesome.
That's awesome.
It's cool, man.
I appreciate that, Magpie.
This thing hits.
The day before I got here, I almost bought a rig
and it showed up in the mail and I was like, holy ****.
Yeah, it's three millimeter deep.
You'd be able to see that thing in there.
If somebody gave me one of those,
you'd be able to see that thing clear in there.
Bro, if you don't smoke, you're just a **** time slab.
You're not supposed to lean on here.
Chris, you're **** a taster, man.
We're over here **** sheafing.
It is.
You're a taster.
I got an old corncob pipe I can send you, Chris,
because we know you're trying to get a rig
for every generation that you missed out in.
If you know anybody that blows corncob pipes-
Yeah, you can go get a couple **** butter knives
you guys stole.
Should get you all right.
I got a corncob from the 80s still.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I mean a glass one.
Actually, it's from the 90s.
Yeah, like a glass one, like a good nice one.
I've seen them. Descriptive.
I've seen somebody do it.
It looks like a nice corncobber.
Hey, you got a pretty puppy kit, Cheddar Bob.
Yes, we need to fatten that dog up now.
Smoking a ton of 44Ds.
Hey, RMI, how do you like them 45RDs, man?
How do you like those?
That's what Magpie was talking about earlier.
Yeah, 44Ds.
Yeah, you made some hash with that.
No, I was talking about 44 dogs.
It's a different one.
44Ds is AJ's sour diesel to Ava,
the one of my older angel crosses.
Yeah, 44 dogs is count four in a species.
Right on.
Dude, yeah, man.
That's some good weed, man.
I just did Ghost to Kim 4,
which is Kim 4 to Ghost OG, Ghost OG,
Kimbox, West Reserve, and the Mudbone to Kim 4.
Wow.
Where'd DP go?
He's going to get munchies.
Bro, when he gets back,
everyone guilt trip the fuck out of him
because he's technically the host.
You mean gets back, he's right there.
No, he's not.
He's not on camera and he's let us all down.
So, Montezuma, the Space Cheese backcross three.
Hold on, Tristan.
My Space Cheese backcross three means,
the BX3 means that it's a backcross number three.
I did three different backcrosses to Space Cheese.
One with the Panga, one with Ghost, and one with GMO.
That's just the number three one.
It's the one that everyone likes the most.
So that's what I released on there.
There's freebies of the number one
and number two on Daga also.
But the number three is what Magpie ran and Manderson's ran,
and they both found the most consistent.
Yeah, I ran all three of them.
And favorable highs out of them.
Not that the other ones were bad,
it was just they liked it the most.
So I don't release everything to the public all the time,
like for sale.
So that's why that the backcross three's for sale
and the other ones are for free.
And then there's the 50 or 100.
Yeah, this is some flower from the backcross three right here.
Any of my packs that you purchase on Daga
will come with a 10 pack of from Magpie.
It's not trimmed yet, but.
For the next 100 packs.
Dude, that shit looks fire as fuck.
Canadian goose right there.
You don't even, dude, that's beautiful.
Magpie grows better weed than me, guys.
Him and Jim and Gondar.
Canadian mints.
That's some fucking fire, dude.
They grow some good ass weed up in Canada, dude.
They can't talk and don't know how to use A correctly.
But I mean, it's fire as weed.
Plus, plus, I have Magpie admitting
that he's an American, too, without the Canadian attitude.
So maybe he's really just an American that's
up there on vacation and never left his visa.
He got a visa for growing weed.
We want him back.
He grows killer weed.
He processes killer hash.
And he passes killer glass, man.
That dude's a fucking, he's golden, man.
And he's funny.
Yeah, he's hella funny for sure.
Over here blushing, you guys.
I appreciate this friendship, man.
But like, that dude does grow some killer weed, man.
And he's skinny.
I heard he's adoptable, too.
I don't know.
Wow.
Only if you can smuggle me out of the country, dog.
I don't even know how to make that happen, dog.
Hold on.
That hash he made, he got some killer hash, dude.
I'll tell you that, dude.
And it ain't because it's my shit.
I seen him processing stuff from a few different people.
The stuff from Pistol Positive was coming out, man.
Yeah, Pistol Positive, man, his flour makes some,
it consistently makes some killer hash.
RMI, fuel 44, fuel forward rotten fruit.
That's exactly what I wanted out of it.
Yeah, that Mary Lou I was showing you guys earlier,
that real greasy, like, potty stuff, that was,
one of those was Mary Lou, and one of them was 44 Dogs.
44 Dogs.
The Mary Lou's, the Mary Lou's from Pistol Positive,
which is Levi and Jay.
And that one is Love and Limes to Luana, is the cross.
And Luana's a male he was working with
from some Hawaiian stock.
And Love and Limes, I'm not too familiar with,
so I can't really talk on that one, I'm not sure.
I'm trying to remember, I can't remember
the last time I made it.
I think it's something he made.
I might be wrong, but I'm pretty sure it's one,
it's something, it's like his work
that he picked a female out of,
and then his work that he picked a male out of,
I'm pretty sure.
Because I got some of the Luana F2 running now
in the flower room, man, that shit's crazy.
Now, what do you mean by crazy?
That was the one, man, that I got,
I had 21 Cs, and 19 of them were males.
First time that's ever happened.
I've never had a male ratio that high, ever.
What a, yeah.
This one right here, these are the Luana F2s here.
Yeah, that's from Levi and Jason,
Mr. Positive, the Pistol Brother.
Both of them real good friends of mine,
those guys are good people, man.
Grow some killer weed and breed some killer weed.
Oh, snap.
After this, we'll call the giveaway.
Jason just came to my house last year.
The life of an Instagram,
Instagram model girl, looking up her skirt.
Where's that?
Oh yeah, bro, I love coming here.
I'll tell her I'm a dog, too, shit.
There's some of the cheese star there.
There you go, that's the Death Star, the space cheese.
Everyone that's grown that one loves that one.
This is my favorite weed ever.
All over that one.
That's awesome.
Yeah, there's two copies of each female.
They really like, they get like super rockin'.
They almost look like they're seeded,
even when they're not.
He's like, if you never knew what weed was
but smoked these,
oh, this is what weed's supposed to be right here.
Yeah, like this is my favorite weed
that I've ever grown or smoked so far.
Like, man, it's just so like,
it's so nasty and garlic and rubber and fucking rot.
Just like every kind of like raunchy smell
and like blue cheese, like, oh, just, oh.
That's ridiculous.
Like the carbon filters just don't even work with this shit.
That's how I figured out how stinky they were at first.
Text Tone laughing,
because I was hanging out my dog's backyard for two days.
Hey, so we found skunk, it's in Canada, bro.
It's outside my broom.
Fucking pissing all over my fucking canisters out here,
Archie, weed.
Yeah, this is a Rochesquimbus here, too.
Yeah, that one's named after my mom, Rochesquimbus.
My mom, her friends gave her that name in college,
that and Savage Kush.
And that's a combination of Savage Kush and Space Cheese.
Space Cheese and Savage Kush both have Angel in it,
which is named after my father.
That's a family affair right there.
That one took me years to make.
It's good ass weed, too.
A lot of great-
I'm going over this way.
I got the, my keepers of the 44 dogs
and Toes91 and all that are back there.
Yeah, everything's finishing out.
Starting to get nice and colorful.
Note to self, I say it every time,
don't put fucking plants in the fucking aisleways,
but I do it every fucking time.
God damn it.
Lost space is useless.
Yeah, this is some Green Bodies work.
I never run his gear before,
but I picked some up in a charity auction through Peter.
He's a good girl, good work.
Yeah, yeah, man, it's some femme gear.
I never really fucked with too much of it,
but I mean, fucking looks nice, it smells good.
It's like real fruity, like, you know, mangoes, citrus.
Just packing on rising.
Yeah.
This is the backpack right here.
Yeah, that one's fire.
I'm aiming back for my brother.
My brother Ray passed away, man, when he was little.
He got in a fight with a guy working at Denny's
over losing a backpack at the fucking Denny's.
When we get to the store or to the restaurant,
he's in there cussing out the guy.
He's like nine years old yelling at the guy
behind the counter, I want my Pac-Man backpack.
Every time he got pissed off the rest of his life,
we fucking yell backpack at his ass
to make him get even more mad and shit, fuck with him.
So when he passed away, I named that one backpack.
The black-wop fruit space here,
that's a collab that me and Dutch Blonde did.
You can get that over at Doggarden
or at the Regenerative Seed Co.
Cause I sent a whole bunch of packs over to Dutch
so he could do whatever he wanted to do with them
and you can get them over there.
This is Toadz91 right here.
Kim91.
You, uh, goes to OG Kim Dogg's Best of Reserve.
That's more OG and gas than everything else.
This purple one over here is a taco
and that's a 44 Dogg's, it's held by the leaves.
No matter what you do and how healthy you keep it,
it just naturally has its initials on the leaves.
Resin Rails?
Venus Flytrap.
Yup.
I'm not really into ducking,
but I think it would be nice to fucking process
and get it in the costume chain.
Oh yeah, bro, that's the stuff that makes...
Yeah, if it wasn't to make 10 hash,
you'd make 10 bucks.
Yeah, that red one looks fun.
Yeah.
Yeah, dude.
There's the Gary Payton there,
just fucking bagging this one down.
I gotta pull it down tomorrow.
That thing's nasty, that plant, I tell you.
Keep on that one.
It runs quick, though.
It didn't last one super long.
Got the Gary Payton in there
and you still like that T-Star better than that?
Small town, man, dude.
This is Trinity here.
There's your thunder, Scott.
Strong.
Super skunky, finish it fast.
I'm gonna go around you, Scott.
Hey, man, can you stand right under the fan?
Just stand right in front of...
Put your phone inside the fan, please.
My earpiece is literally inside my ear.
Oh, we know.
We know.
I didn't say I was bringing fucking fire soundtrack.
Hey, listen, the sound is shit, but the view is awesome.
The views drive the soundstruck, eh?
Looking great, though, man.
Your fan sounds like a hoser, eh?
Hey.
It happens.
Must have been that Canadian fan work.
I'm telling you, Magpies goes killer weed, dude.
Like you can see, no matter who's genetics in there,
it's all fire, man.
Fucking killing it.
I try.
Yeah, there's a Gary Payton there.
Nice.
It's a real nice plant,
but it definitely doesn't like going long.
It's starting to get fucking real angry.
Yeah.
Same as the Trob Cookies.
This bitch is almost on the floor.
Not to take it down tomorrow,
because it's falling over.
Yeah, my buddy just took one down like that,
pretty much, I think.
We had to trail this all the way up.
Yeah, I had a bunch in this, but I mean, it's still.
Real pretty, but I mean, it smells like fucking cardboard.
Mm.
Yeah.
It was given to me like on that kind of like note,
as like, hey, it's Instagram weed.
Like if you're putting it in a bag, it would be awesome.
I wasn't gonna turn down a chance to run it,
just because it's one of those, you know,
most popular ones.
I'm just curious to see what fucking people
were all hype about.
Intense Garden says,
why doesn't she have the clone already, Magpie?
Yo, dog, I sent them flower,
and no one asked me for a clone.
If they asked, I would have sent it,
but I'm not just gonna fire clones in the mail
fucking without permission.
That's how close it is.
Wow, it's a lot of backpedaling.
No, I was explaining.
Call me no backpedaling.
I think it's because he knows
she grows better weed than him.
I never said that.
She didn't, you know what I mean?
She knows she's the fucking queen, dog.
Her and Magpie over there fucking throwing fire
from across Canadian border, dude.
I just don't know why it's still so pulled up there, dude.
How did you guys end up with Beasters
when you guys can actually grow that good?
That's what I wanna know.
That's just what we sold you guys.
No, man, that's not how it works.
We're a hustler, baby.
That's not how it works.
Just want you to know.
That's not how it works.
That's terrible.
This is some cheese starter here.
What's up, Harvey?
You guys need a code?
Man, I'm sitting here enjoying
the really awesome high that I got from smoking that THC,
the hardcore that grew up in the gorilla garden.
And the one thing, like,
conversation's been rolling since I was smoking on it.
I really wanted to say, as I smoked it,
I was experiencing choux terroir, right?
So I literally bred the strain to grow in the canyon
and toss the seeds on the side of the mountain.
And that stuff just is growing there
in the natural native soil
without anything but rainwater and snow melt.
And then it's, that's from five or six years ago now.
And that was a really fucking awesome bowl of hash
I just smoked.
And I wouldn't have done it
if I hadn't joined you guys tonight.
So thanks for letting me visit with some of my friends
that are no longer,
because that's what that hash is all about also.
That's awesome.
Always been my goal is getting good weed
on the exact mountain.
Temple balls like where you and Magpie roll are fucking nice.
I like fucking old school, dark, fucking hand rolled hash.
Yeah, it was cool.
Alex broke out like all kinds of different ones
and whatnot.
It's like what I'm doing.
It's like seeing how I'm doing it.
You go from hand rolled over there,
to your foot stomped right over here.
We'll work our way down here to the bottom
till we get to concentrations over here
by Corey and Magpie dude.
Yeah, you got Chris making foot hash.
You got these guys smoking fucking crazy high grade rosin.
You got the whole spectrum.
Epic.
And that's a hand rolled hash toad.
I got the finger hash.
So I'm on the bottom of the bucket right now.
I'm right below Chris.
Don't you have a Bickett?
Can you just say that?
No, I'm just talking shit, dude.
I'm just, you know.
I'm not smoking some fire ass shit from Corey.
Yeah, for sure.
Don't front like you don't know how to make fucking hash.
He's making fucking waves as you're talking.
Being all bachelors, like,
yeah, I don't know how to make hash.
Yeah.
I don't know how to make hash.
He's not even about it.
It's been a long time since I've been able to make hash
with bags because of my chair, dude.
I can't lift fucking my chair up.
But the old chair was even worse.
So like, I got two chairs now.
I go out there in that old fucking chair.
That's what I'm saying.
Those kettle bells, that new chair,
you'll be fucking lifting bags in no time, bruh.
I used to have a rig where I can hold 40 gallons of water.
I can process like three pounds of fucking hash in an hour
with a friend.
Me and my buddy used to do that shit every week
when we were doing Edibles Company.
DP, did you do that giveaway yet?
Love doing hash.
Yeah, did we forget about the bubble cap giveaway?
No, you guys all lost and DP won.
That's what I'm thinking.
Right there, DB has it.
No, those things are awesome.
Scott gave glasses.
So whoever wins, be happy.
I'd be really happy if I won.
Everybody who doesn't know,
since I said 10 minutes, like 40 minutes ago probably,
you can type in hashtag bubble cap
and you get a chance to win this phenomenal-
And what's the other hashtag?
Shabooski's right over here.
And if you type in hashtag magpie for president-
See your comprehension, bro.
I was testing you.
I've said it a few times.
Magpie for president.
I was gonna ask you-
Bro, if Ted Cruz can do it, I can do it.
Oh boy.
I'm about to take this dab of melt, my last one.
Really nice.
Really nice.
You gotta blow yourself up, dude.
You're like fucking three quarters of an inch big.
Well, because I'm trying to show off the bubble cap.
You did already.
Now you can show your dab.
You gotta multitask.
You gotta move, move, move.
You're a ruthless brat.
You are ruthless.
A luck, sir.
A luck.
And don't blame the weed.
Those are cool.
You never blame the weed, bro.
Those are cool, man.
How's that?
The weed is, I'm thankful for it.
Now I gotta read the artists.
Chris says if he wins, can you blow him a different one?
Cause those aren't exactly what he wants for free, so.
Yeah, right.
I did not say that.
I'll just add it.
You're a motherfucker, bro.
I got the text right here.
It's on my phone, Chris.
You want those for free?
That's not true.
As long as it fits into my-
DP, that one, you have a stick, man.
That thing's sick, brother.
The whole rig's sick, dude.
You know I'm just messing with you, Chris, brother.
All right, you guys ready?
Let's do this.
Hell yeah, I'm ready.
I've been ready.
44 entries.
Remember last time it landed right on Frank's name
and then went click and then went over to fucking Wayne?
Wayne won, dude.
Oh man, I-
Frank won.
There's still a giveaway outstanding.
There you go, dude.
The cheese star stock, bro.
Come on, y'all.
Coming up.
Where you at?
It would've, that'd be so awesome
if Wayne won again, dude.
And Australia just keeps coming up on shit, dude.
Is he coming up?
Is he coming up?
He did.
He did.
Yup.
Going down, you're the next contestant on.
Go sit on my ass.
Way to go, DD.
That's awesome.
All right, we'll see if he's in here.
Wayne only wins if the product costs less
than it costs to send it all the way over there, dude.
That's what we were talking about earlier.
Yeah, he's not in here.
He does not win.
Is that the rules?
What's that?
Is that it?
No, that's not true.
That is not true.
Oh yeah, it's DD.
No.
No, it's gonna say D&D on the thing.
Where's the D&D?
Well, it's not D&D.
Mon, if you want, how many seeds can one plant give?
That's crazy.
Oh, wow.
A lot.
Depends on what the plant is.
A male plant has more potential to offer
up to 300,000 grains of pollen in every stamina flower.
So like, that's on a maximum level.
If you can find enough females, technically,
that's too many.
All right, there's both.
Yeah, that's the exact amount.
Yeah, like a little mason jar like this
full of pollen is like enough to pollinate the earth.
There it is.
One big 12 foot sativa female
is got a lot of seed sites on it, right?
Yeah, man.
Now, you can see the audience.
Oh yeah, like if you let a hazed male go all over something,
you get a crazy amount of pollen.
He was able to-
A big male haze will devastate some stuff, dude.
That thing can drop some pollen right there, for real.
I think this is Dalton Davis.
Dane Dice?
Dalton Benjamin Davis' second account.
Maybe it's-
BDO.
This is too much of a coincidence.
Too much of a coincidence this guy has D&D for his initials.
Bro, no, it's too late, he covered it.
I know, I know.
If he's a mastermind enough to do that, he wins, dude.
Yeah, for real, you can have it.
If you wanted it that bad, let's call it winning.
Boom.
I don't remember you entering the world, dude.
You entered it and it was your contest.
What's going on?
I'd love to win that.
I'm looking-
You're being real.
I remain fucking calm and I didn't even enter them.
Come on.
That's just badass.
Yeah, but you got an endless supply of glass.
I know this because I have one-
You know why I do?
Because there's never enough.
That's why Alec has more than a half million marbles.
Because there's never enough.
Not only do you have the glass,
but you had your mother-
I want that little-
We need protective covers for them.
I want that little blue and green one.
They're awesome.
That would be the one I'd want to see again.
Can't stop.
They're all pretty in their own way.
One piece of glass is not gonna be enough.
You sent one to Hall What You Got
that kind of looked like the one
he was showing on the show here.
That thing was awesome.
Yeah, I sent him a monster from Kairou Glass.
You smell like a monster.
That's not very nice.
Oh, I didn't know I was off mute, sorry.
Wow.
Cheers.
Flags away.
This is a Canadian flag.
How about that?
You smell like instant coffee and ramen noodles.
It's like maple syrup.
He's over there dabbing that magical honey, man.
I'm telling you what, dude,
if dabs were invented when we were in high school,
we would have burned the earth down, you guys.
the
the
I had a problem. I mean, I know my high school's nickname was crack high.
Damn.
Jesus.
I have this homeboy that I went to high school with. I went to high school in the 90s and
he was in Britain. He got out of prison. I went over there to get him. I had damaged
him out. And when he saw what I pulled out to use, he's like, no man, fuck that. I'm
not smoking anything like that. I don't get out like that.
Dude, same thing happened the first time I smoked fucking VHO, bro. My tattoo artist
brought it over and I was like, I'm not fucking smoking that. That's not weed. And I smoked
the first one and I immediately got upset with him. I'm like, what the fuck was that?
Like I got angry. I was so fucking hot.
I was at a dead show and traded a hash cookie for some guy who had some hash. And he was
a kid from Oregon and I've been living over here. And I go back to all these guys from
further East to our circle of Volkswagen, to the squirts of hash. And the guys took
it from me and they looked at it and the guy went to light it, to fluff it because we only
had crappy hash back in the day. And he went to fluff it and it melted and bubbled like
proper bubble hash. And he's like, that ain't hash. And he threw it off into the gravel
of the parking lot.
Man, probably 2001, maybe at the gorge.
So if anyone lives in that area and they're real desperate, you can go sniff through the
gravel.
Man, I made some sift recently and this dude, he called me up and he's like, I smoked it
out of my bubbler.
And he had a blank. He's like, who the fuck did you make that with? He thought it had
some solvent in it or something. And it was just some sift hash.
I just did that with my bubbler.
Popping a blue flame, seeing how I smoke it.
What?
That's what I'm asking. Why not give him a-
It took me a while to let somebody blow the torch because I grew up in the city.
Oh, I see what you're saying. I got you.
That's for sure.
What do you do for work?
Yeah, man.
I'm a chef.
I know, yeah.
You're a chef.
I'm a chef.
I'm a chef.
I'm a chef.
I'm a chef.
I'm a chef.
I'm a chef.
I'm a chef.
I'm a chef.
I'm a chef.
I'm a chef.
I'm a chef.
I'm a chef.
That was further fast, James says.
Just flashing back to stupid things we did as kids.
Toad, you got any tricks to make that Bubba veg faster?
Man.
Not really.
A quarter teaspoon of diesel.
I mean, lift the fucking lights up and aerate the root zone.
She wants way more air in the system.
She'll grow much faster in ebb and flow than she will in an organic system.
She's slow in an organic system.
Yeah, everyone kind of says that she veggies slow.
She's similar to Urkel.
Yeah, I suspect it.
I've got some killer butt off that motherfucker, man.
That thing's a bomb.
That's good weed.
I just dropped a back cross to that plant on Dogger.
Hmm.
Back cross of what?
Bubba.
Bubba back cross.
It's a plant.
Cool.
Very cool.
I'm working on 17 years of having that plant with me now.
I did the ghost above the two, so I did the bubble across to Ghost OG, Ghost OG, Ken Dog
special reserves.
That'll stretch it out.
I finally scored these Pan sheer Afghani's and I'm gonna try to do a big old seed run
three from field. Okay.
Bill's Crossy Bravo will make pretty much a true hybrid like F1s. They're going to represent
as true breeding plants for many of their trades.
So I think I did two males and three females in the mix as an open pollination type of
thing. Try to keep it kind of an open genetic and mangoes, tropical fruit, and some really
good mixed hash I made when I grew that stuff out for sure.
Yeah, they've grown everything. Like they've grown far faster than everything.
You get everything. Big leaves on them.
Yeah, big old fatties and long and fat.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's the ones.
Montezuma C.
You're not in California, are you?
In Montezuma, if you're a senior, let me tell this person.
If you're a senior, a veteran, or a senior.
You can get two seeds from Dogwood. You don't got to buy them.
Okay.
No, I haven't been. Let's see. I was out there this summer for a wedding.
Yeah, I was up in one of those cabins. My first wife was buried for five days there up above Crestline.
Where the grocery store roof collapsed completely.
But, no, I left 97, came out here to Utah.
Utah?
How do you like it out there?
I'm still here. I was going to leave some time ago, but my daughter came along.
So, here I am.
A lot of people asked why I didn't leave during Green Rush.
It's because my daughter's here and not there.
It come down to it. My daughter needed me a whole lot more.
I was able to help and influence and teach people how to grow organics through the internet.
It's pretty cool.
Meet people around the world and stuff.
Interact and do things.
We all keep moving forward and changing.
Back in the day, it was boots on the ground and going for the Governor of California when I was going to college.
Talking and laying down the knowledge about cannabis.
Fighting for people's rights.
It happens in different ways.
I got a whole different set of people to interact with.
Expose people.
You got a lot of snow on the ground right now?
We had a pretty good dump last week.
I had 18-20 inches in the yard.
Up on the mountain, there was 3 feet last night up at one of the resorts.
I'm down 4,400 feet in the valley.
We rarely get snow that stays around.
It used to stick around all winter, 2-3 feet deep.
It's rare.
We get it as deep as it is anymore.
It used to be where...
Was it cold there in winter?
Yeah.
This winter was one of the colder.
I just got my gas bill for last month.
It was the biggest gas bill I've ever had.
Between the greenhouse and the house.
I think we got down to 2 degrees.
It gets colder in other places.
Where I'm at, we do have...
Where my North Utah hash plant was bred,
that's one of the coldest places in America near Logan.
We get 2 months below 20, basically.
You said 2 months?
Yeah, basically about 2 months.
We're right at 20 degrees or below.
That's when I like to make my hash.
I gotta be careful with the hose and stuff.
Fill up a 35 or 15 gallon and let it freeze over.
Work it before it completely freezes up.
You gotta skim the ice off of the buckets as it's freezing up.
As you're running the water through the screens.
It's a really cold process.
It's nice like that too when it's really cold.
In the sub 20 degrees.
I'm happy to hear all that snow might actually keep the Salt Lake around, though.
Well, we don't have enough.
We'll definitely get a bump.
The biggest problem right now is there's a lot of growth.
There's a lot of growing alfalfa that gets shipped off to China.
Yeah, it's all that damn agriculture taking the water.
I had a farm here in the valley that used some of the water.
A lot of water flows in, but the alfalfa is truly
one of the highest consumptions.
It's usually run on deep sandy loam, so it's not a surface.
It's a clay where it runs through.
It's just flood irrigated.
The water would saturate the surface and keep going.
The deep sandy loam that you need to grow the alfalfa, you're doing the saturation.
You're constantly flooding it and it's dropping in.
It's going down into the aquifer.
I grew up surrounded by alfalfa just north of you.
I was always disgusted.
The alfalfa is so drought hardy, yet the way that they would
water it was just ridiculous.
They would just flood fields out.
Then it got all that roundup ready alfalfa.
That really made it.
I've been looking like, who is that kid down the corner all day?
What's up Austin?
Sorry bro.
Austin might be the only one that pulls.
Austin's been to the house here a couple of times.
Epic.
My house is really good and I need glasses.
Sorry.
There he is.
Austin grew up just up the road
from where I'm at here.
I grew up there in Southern California.
I left there in 1996 and came out here.
It's definitely changed.
The last time we had huge snow cycles, the lakes all filled up and flooded.
There's hopeful. We'll see what happens.
For sure.
Nice.
Austin makes some killer hash, that's for sure.
I need to get you
I totally spaced on it when you were here. I hooked up with some seeds.
What I need to get you is the St. Bernard.
The St. Bernard Northern Utah Hash Plant.
We'll probably finish where you're at.
I would love to run something
of that Northern Utah Hash Plant.
Just off the name, really.
That's 88 Hash Plant.
It was bought originally by a fellow who farmed
at the Logan Canyon. He ran that for 17 generations.
I ended up getting it
from his son-in-law.
Pretty good stuff.
Where's that echo coming from?
That was crazy.
It's weird.
Nice.
We have identical weather up here in Spokane.
It's just as short of a season.
Just as cold. Maybe a touch colder sometimes.
Go get that.
Dry, hot summer though.
We've had crazy winters up here in Chicago
the last couple of winters.
I haven't been up here too terribly long either.
I've been up here almost shy of a decade.
Even then, we were shoveling out
every winter when I first got up here.
Now we've been in ankle deep snow the last three years.
It's just fleeting.
I bought this place in 2000.
The first few years, I was a pro skier.
I always wanted to build a jump off of my roof
where you slide in off of these chimney
and go across a laundry room, what we call a kicker or a jump
and jump over the hot tub where you'd have bikini girls
and guys working out on the trampoline at night
and it's been 20 years.
The way you really tell, because we're small, our lives are short
and our perception is dimmed.
You have to put an instrument on to see it's Austin down there in the fine print.
I had better than 20 vision most of my life until about three years ago.
I had something really profound to say.
It definitely ties you, especially when I get into the hashes.
Tree rings.
Tree rings and soil accumulation records.
This is where we really see where the weather and soil
even becomes rock over time.
Dendrochronology and those ice records and all that stuff
tell us the true story of the cycles and how those things are really changing.
It's kind of like looking out. We can see the weather is this and the weather is that.
It's kind of like looking out at the horizon and saying I can't see the curve
of the earth, therefore it's flat or it's not flat because
my head sees a curve or I get on a mountain and I see
whatever I see from there.
When we look at the bigger picture, there's definitely been some change.
This is kind of like
a throwback to how it used to be.
Yeah, definitely.
I remember my grandpa talking about people riding canoes down State Street
in Salt Lake back in the...
82-83 it would have been.
I can't remember if it was late 70s or early 80s.
78 maybe too. There was big snow in 78.
82-83 I was riding surf in Newport Beach and they were slamming
up and taking out the piers on the Pacific Ocean.
We would just put on big... there were such huge waves.
You'd just put on dive fins and flip flops and you'd swim up and you'd go
up the face and it would throw you out and you'd just kind of dive in and grab sand
at the bottom. It was a massive wall of water pummeled over you and
you'd get up and try to catch air and do it again.
I think that's stupid is if we're going up right now and it's extreme avalanche
danger up there and I would go hiking
solo. But I was young and dumb.
I know better now.
Yeah.
Alright. Is everyone else as high as I am?
Correct.
I'm blooming out good for you DP.
DP your hash looks moldy as f**k bro.
This is the wrong crowd to be trying to
sell macadamia nuts at moldy dude.
Your macadamia nuts are wack bro.
Hey DP man
I love the colors in the background on this thing dude.
Every time I see it that's gold f**k it makes me smile dude.
I love the colors. They're the same colors as my
damn logo but it reminds me of my first skateboard
so them colors are cool.
Oh cool. Oh Japanese forbidden art.
Is that what you're talking about Toad?
No the one on the background that's on the screen.
Like what's below me?
Yeah like full screen it without the people.
Yeah thank you.
I saw them do it earlier I don't know how they did it.
Chris could do it.
Yeah I gotta be able to sit down to do it and not have my
bum hurts or what's up.
He's got a sore bum bum.
You smoking your culero?
I just figured out how to do it.
You're getting dizzy I'm jumping in.
There's Chris. There's me. There's Cory.
There's Mac Pie.
And there's Miss Toad and there's Hardy Gear.
I didn't even know Austin was back there.
No I thought that was a different Austin.
I got confused.
In front of Cory too.
He's doing all the excuses.
No shame.
You making excuses for the excuses now?
Well this one time like if you take an excuse
and if you take the front of it and you just like subtract the back of it.
Man you're talking like daylight savings.
Yeah.
Cut the top off the blanket and sew it on the bottom and you say you got a longer blanket.
Cut that E off the front and sew it off the back.
What did they say a farmer came up with that shit?
Daylight savings?
Imagine if we started a freaking like a TikTok challenge
everyone just don't turn back the clock or don't spring forward.
Everyone just don't do it.
What are all the businesses going to do if all the workers don't
show up an hour later?
Do we all leave and stay on the same clock?
Was one of you guys Canadian in here?
Yeah that's a Canadian.
He's apologetic over it though.
Does everything in your town just like close
when it's winter time and it gets dark real early?
Nah that's me.
Or they call it Maine and his part of the woods.
We had a mild winter this year
but it gets even colder where Jen and them are at.
I don't know how to think about it in freedom units.
It gets to minus 20 F where I am and where Jen and them are
it gets to minus 50 C with the wind chill.
I don't even know what that is in freedom units.
Over here in Spokane it's like everybody just shuts down.
We can just close early all winter.
If we get 2 feet of snow or something crazy
stuff might close but not really.
Most stuff just opens late.
It's not super bad where I'm at.
I'm in southern Ontario. I'm 25 miles southeast of Toronto.
How far from the fence are you?
Not that far. I'm pretty close to a few of the fences.
It wasn't unpatrolled at one point.
You pulled up to this booth and you picked up a phone and called the people and waited
and they come out. That was the protection at the border when I was a kid.
Laughter
Literally you just had an auto dial phone
and you picked it up and it would call them. Sometimes it would take 45 minutes for anyone to get there.
What did they do on the other side?
That's literally what they did.
It would be like a normal border crossing but it was on the honor system.
Laughter
They made it bigger now but the clear cutting
between the countries like up by BC and whatnot
at one point it was only 100 feet. How fast can you run 100 feet?
Laughter
I've heard canoe stories where you just
canoe across the border and you go back and forth.
I used to be with the Canadian
and he was always talking about going up and loading
backpacks and running across like that.
I had friends in high school, like the older class, like when we were in grade 9, a bunch of the grade 12's
went out to BC and that's what they did.
You just put 100 pounds or 50 pounds or whatever you carry on your back and you just
hike and then run for 30 seconds and then you just hike.
Laughter
Joe, are you talking? We can't hear you. Your mic's off, dude.
I got some buddies over here.
He's writing raps like B-Rabbit.
He must be talking to somebody else.
He's got his phone on. Hopefully he's not talking to himself.
He's like, yeah, no, we should be done. He's really having a deep conversation with himself.
He's talking to some gangsters.
He's like, yeah, I got in the Nikes, I got them in my size, I got them in
your size, I got them in everybody's size.
Laughter
I think they're called Schmeikys.
They're still made in the same place.
Just a different shift.
I need something. More pineapple.
Oh, that sounds pretty serious.
So, okay, check this out. Remember how you
asked me questions about this thing? So I did not read the
directions when I got it because I think they took my man card
away from me. So I was told.
So I didn't, so I'm here in Reno.
So now reading the directions and finding out what this thing
does.
You know why it came with directions, right, Chris?
I'm reading the directions now. Something to read after you put it together?
Yeah, if you understand what's going on, right?
Alright, so the thing vaporizes, this is the
temperatures that goes from 310 at the lowest
to 350 in the middle-ish, right at
12 o'clock and 425 if I put it all
the way to the high level. So 425 is
the highest? Yes.
If you make vaporized oil, it tells you
what the temperature for vaporizing oil is
on here. Because if you want to do oil, do it at this
temperature. I'm going to smoke some frankincense and myrrh.
Oh, I don't know.
I use that stuff for
like the holy anointing oil, right?
And using that stuff, it's so potent
it kills all the microbes in your system instantly
when you make that stuff. It's one of the stronger
medicines I've ever put together.
I know frankincense has a weird effect.
Antiviral, antimicrobial,
bacterial, I'm looking for my own. You say weird effect
but do you smoke it?
I have had extreme...
I was just kidding, Chris. Don't smoke frankincense or myrrh.
It's pretty intense. It's like an incense when you go to Catholic church
ceremonies, right?
I fell asleep one time when I was in high school experimenting with it
on a coal, a hot coal, some
I woke up with
extreme nausea, just projectile
vomit, diarrhea.
Killed my buddy about the next day and he smoked some.
Alright, Chris. So only smoke a little bit.
So you have more cells in your body that are microbes than you have human cells.
It messes up your whole system.
It's great if you're sick because you're killing off the disease
and kickstarting if you don't overload it.
It's just like any other antibacterial or...
It's like chemo. Kill it all and see what's left.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. If you overdo it.
It's like killing off all the candida. You get really sick going through that hole.
Wow.
I mean, that's a good medicine for it, right?
I also found out that I was putting way too much herbae into it, too.
Well, that's all perception.
That sounds like a f***ing opinion to me.
Are you guys trying to teach Chris how to properly
load his apparatus?
He's just telling us to keep volunteering about his apparatus.
Hopefully soon to be on Dog of Dog Garden.
And then Alex convinced me that Chris needs to start experimenting
with frankincense and myrrh. Just smoke a little bit, Chris.
It's for us. It's for our education.
Chris doesn't care how it smokes. He didn't read the instructions.
Yeah, that's what I'm saying. So just do it. Get like 2-3 grams of salvia.
Put a little bit of frankincense and myrrh on top of it. Hit it with a blowtorch.
Oh, that's what that mine's for.
There's a little mine right there.
It escalates quickly, alright?
Quickly. It's an experiment.
We might as well get the maximum amount of effect out of the experiment.
I smoked mushrooms at the First Grateful Dead concert I went to.
That's a problem with me.
Do not eat the brown ass.
The 2.5 four-way window panes
and the other quarter of mushrooms we ate and the rum and the hashish
It all worked good.
I didn't feel it initially for hours.
And then when I felt it, I literally
thought I was in a tunnel. My vision went like this.
I was in a tunnel vision like this.
When did you have window panes?
This was probably, I want to say, rule
98
97
That could have been some analog even.
I wasn't taking acid at that point in my life.
86, when I did that, I was 15.
It was exciting.
Throw that in the mix, Chris. Throw a couple drops of acid on your eyeball
while you're smoking. I took four hits of that.
Right?
Get a snack and some fecal.
270 times 4
10 of them, basically.
2700 micrograms.
That's how I talk to you.
I would not doubt it.
I became one with all of them.
Dude, I was
seriously, like I said, this is what happened.
This is exactly what the trip was.
He goes like this when I pick it up.
Careful with this shit. It's potent.
You only need to take one.
I said, okay.
We went over and kicked it with these chicks
and we're in a hot tub.
I didn't take acid at all while we were in the hot tub.
I took another hit.
I still didn't feel it.
A couple hours later, I took another hit.
A couple hours later, I took another hit.
We walked about two miles down the road.
We stopped over at this 7-Eleven, grabbed a jug of orange juice.
We both took the same amount.
I think I took one more than him.
We're drinking this orange juice,
walking down the street.
We get over to my friend's house.
He goes, hey man, I got some vitamin C tablets.
I heard that citric acid increases it.
I took the vitamin C tablets
and we go outside.
We're sitting in the chairs and there's
some unripe limes right there on the tree.
I cut the unripe lime in half.
I douse myself with that.
My friend's dad gets home and I'm looking through one of those
cast iron gate door things.
You can see him through there.
The light was coming through another window.
I was staring through it and I saw him talking to his dad.
I wasn't tripping and shit.
His dad's cool, I guess.
He's talking to his dad.
I see him when he comes out.
My vision was still stuck in the focus of that door.
When I look up, all I see is these birds fly by
and they left these laser beams right behind them and shit.
You didn't feel a thing?
No. All of a sudden, I started feeling numb.
My whole body couldn't feel shit on myself.
All of a sudden, my vision starts going like this.
It starts going like this into a tunnel.
I was like, holy shit, what the fuck is going on?
I've taken many hits of acid before.
This has never happened before.
Only shit that's ever happened is breathing and doing this type of shit.
It's going like this and shit.
I was looking through a fucking thing like people
and shit. I'm like, what the fuck is going on?
I'm like, holy shit. My friend sees my eyes and shit
because he's like, what the fuck? Why is he looking like he's
fucking on one and shit?
My friend goes, hey, maybe we should give him some speed.
They gave me some speed and I was like, I fucking turned
into Cheech from when he did the space coke and shit.
I fucking started running around the fucking yard.
I'm like fucking dousing water on myself
like this and shit.
I'm fucking going around the fucking yard
and shit. It was all bad.
I didn't feel right for months after that.
I don't even know if it was still all right for me.
Then you woke up on the kitchen floor and realized you actually smoked PCP?
Yeah.
How long did it last? My trip was 72 hours.
Yeah. Dude, it lasted
at least 72 hours.
After that, after I calmed down from that shit,
we went into a room. I was trying to play video games
and I could not play video games because the screen kept on going like this.
I looked up and he had a blacklight poster.
Everywhere after I looked, I was like, oh, fuck.
I looked at the blacklight poster and everywhere I looked up after that,
we had that pattern everywhere. It was ingrained into my
fucking skull and shit. Everywhere I was looking and shit.
I could not pick a character. We were playing Twisted Metal.
I don't know if you guys know, which is on the PS1.
I could not pick a character. I kept clicking over to left to left
to left to left to left.
To left to left to left.
I could not pick a character.
It was intense. Like I said, I've fight balls before and
they
they
Oh, this is your chance, man.
And everything's, it feels like, you know,
fair and loathing in Las Vegas
when everything's flying by you like this.
And that's how I felt like everything was like,
we're in a time warp thing, you know,
like when you're flying through the universe
in a time warp thing, that's how everything looked.
I lived in Tuolumne Meadows and I would go to dead shows
and bluegrass festivals in my Volkswagen,
my 68 camper and drive off into Sacramento
or wherever or strawberry.
But I had to get back to work.
So we'd eat acid for the drive back after the show.
I know exactly what you're saying.
It was pretty crazy
because like the fucking Volkswagen running out of gas.
So we just drop a little acid in the tank and keep going.
Fucking.
What the hell?
DP this leaf.
The mythical magical power.
The one thing I remember when I was 15,
that like there's a bunch of shit.
Like I could tell stories about like a crazy trip.
But the one thing I remember was before cell phones
and like we're just tripping after the show,
walking through the parking lot.
And all of a sudden we turned to each other.
It's like, hey, it's time to go.
And then I was out of fucking clue what time it was
or anything, but we walk out
of the entrance of the parking lot, stumble, bumble
and trip our way there.
And as we walked through the freaking
closed parking lot entrance gates past the security,
my dad pulls up right fucking then hadn't come
by once before came up right then as we walked up
and we basically walked up to him as he pulls up
and we got the car and got a ride home.
And that's how things used to work before he had cell phones.
Exactly.
Yeah.
I remember the best time I remember like doing a hit
acid or doing some acid and shit was when I was up
over at Folsom Lake and I was riding my mountain bike
and I was like riding through the lake and everything.
And the late it was probably like right
around sunrise time and it was summer.
So in Sacramento, it was probably like 70, 80 degrees.
And the water is probably like that temperature
to 70, 80 degrees.
So like I was riding my mountain bike through the water
and it was like nothing like I was not riding through water
but it was because it was like the same temperature
as outside.
So it was really trippy and shit.
And I was just like riding through it
and it got deeper and deeper and I'm all like,
oh yeah, this is awesome.
And then we, then I went up to the top of the levee
to the damn levee thing.
And I like looked over the mountains and everything
and it looked like the world tilted just enough
for me to see almost all the way to Tahoe and shit.
And I could see so far and stuff in the shadows
and everything, the way it looked was awesome.
Yeah, I had a lot of fun on Hoolish Ningenics.
I did a lot of mushrooms,
but yeah, that was all before I was 21, 22, 23 years old.
I stopped using LSD after the one time I got arrested
for attempted manslaughter of a police officer.
Stopped me too.
Whoa.
The fucking action stories, that's so quick.
Whoa.
I think I better slow down.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, take it up there.
Spit it out, spit it out.
Oh, you wanna hear the story?
Oh.
Wait, that got away from me really quick.
Oh, the shortest version is,
it was literally just an 11th strip.
The cop barehanded searching my dorm room
and I explained to him real quick what it was before.
Because back then we thought you would,
ho, ho, ho, ho,
they would absorb it to your skin.
And we thought that he was gonna get,
you know, start tripping.
So I'm like, sir, you need to put that down.
It's mysergic acid dip,
it'll be my 25 for personal consumption.
But they were in my dorm room
because I had been like three months,
maybe moved two ounces of grass
at the most conservative university in California
and smoked two ounces to myself.
And someone else probably gotten in trouble
and knocked on me and came knocking on my door
the second time.
And I literally had a,
maybe gram, a chronic stuffed in my pipe.
And this guy came knocking,
I'm talking to my buddy I went to high school with
was there, we were about to listen to literally albums.
Kids at Cal Poly, yeah, in the dorms at Cal Poly.
And then door knocked again.
And I looked at, after the guy left,
I look at my buddy, I'm like,
man, I think I'm about to get busted.
And the door knocks and in comes nine
various types of agency officers, federal.
There was customs agents, there was DEA,
there was campus cops, city cop,
there was state police.
And they thought, it was great
because like they thought I was an international drug kingpin
and they were asking me about the boats of cocaine
from Columbia, which when I was 15 years old
working on the fishing boats,
I did coke off of these kinds of boats,
but I had no other,
actually no had any action with them, right?
But I knew about them.
There was hashish from Afghanistan,
Red Seal that had been sunk in a tanker
along with a whole bunch of chocolate tie
and off of the coast of Santa Barbara in a fishing vessel.
And I smoked that stuff,
but I had no interaction with the organized operations.
And probably there's people who have spoken
on future cannabis project,
who just might know exactly who was the owner
of those sunken ships that people would die for.
But they were asking me about that kind of stuff.
And literally I had moved two ounces
of like cleaned up press weed from Mexico.
And that's how it used to be.
So I had nine, it was interesting.
One of the campus officers was a mountaineering hero of mine.
So when I lived in Yosemite and would,
I did some pretty, you all know Alex Arnold, right?
So I actually did in 1989,
I did a 700 sheer face of the North,
the North face of limber dome.
And it's 10 a plus with just my climbing boots,
pair of shorts and a chalk bag.
And some pretty crazy stupid shit that I used to do
up in the high country there.
I've heard stories of the guys that dug the weed
out of the lake in the frozen winter,
firsthand from guys that did that.
And the diesel weed from the crashed smuggler
playing up there and stuff.
So yeah, lost some train of thought.
I was gonna go over for a nightcap on the hash
cause it's getting late for me.
But I was telling a great story.
What the fuck, where was I?
The brain farted.
You threw a jar of acid on a cop.
That's where the story is.
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
You wanna know how come I got arrested?
How come I got arrested?
Yeah, in the dorm room, that's what it was.
So the federal officer,
I got stuck in Yosemite rock climbing, sorry.
It's beautiful up there.
Here, like literally, like I'm standing here
and this is here in Utah,
but that's my view as I stand and look at you guys, right?
So this guy was a rock climbing hero
and had written the actual routes
for some of the stuff that I used to go climbing
in the back country.
And I guess spent my 21st birthday up in the high, high
Vogelsang, Yosemite, still snow camping.
This guy wrote the original rock climbing routes
for that mountain.
So I'm like, this guy is my hero
in my dorm room arresting me.
But at the same time, they had a rookie
who was doing the search.
And the guy found my rock climbing gear
and rock climbing shoes and a chalk bag.
And in the chalk bag is chalk.
And this kid was clueless
and he thinks he had just scored a big old rock
of some heroin or cocaine or whatever the fuck.
They were looking for.
And the old mountaineer was taking the side.
It's like, no, that's rock climbing chalk.
And we could get really embarrassed
and continue to just rifle the shit out of my desk.
And he came across the, in the very back
in the top drawer center was a camel smokes cigarette box
that was empty with just the aluminum foil wrapped
around 11 strip tucked into the cell of fame.
And he pulled that out and folded it out and grabbed it.
And so, yeah, I was arrested, sent home,
couldn't go to school for a minute.
Luckily I have an awesome sister
who got me an awesome lawyer and I did a diversion
and that got expunged years later and what for not.
I was able to become a federal officer myself.
Some of you might not know that I was a federal officer
before I left California myself.
I don't like your story anymore.
I was a Forest Service pre-cop.
Can you guys hear us?
Yeah, if you left your campfire burning
in near Los Angeles where you kill somebody,
I would have written you a ticket.
But that would have been the only ticket I ever wrote.
I wasn't a cop, I was a federal officer.
Mr. Rangers, sir.
Right, right, no, exactly.
I wore a pickle uniform, I had a badge.
I got at least one of them right here, I think.
Look at that, it's a wildly savior, Peter Savary.
I fought forest fires in you know where.
10 years, 10 years of the hotline,
the heli-rappellers search and rescue.
So we would call what the hotshot crews did,
we call them chicken scratch lines.
Yep.
It was just a good starting point for us to start our lines.
No, you come in and back it up and widen it.
We do four, eight.
Four, eight, sometimes eight, 12.
He's all badged up.
My brother's fire captain at Willits actually.
Last I talked to him, he was doing a couple of days
a week up there as the backup captain.
And then he runs the slurry tanker
at Passive Robles.
No, I know that the hotshot crews, the feds,
they like to do theirs at what, is it four, eight?
Or is it the one that's 16, oh no, no, the-
The days on and off anymore?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I'm talking about they're cutting their fire line
when they cut fire line.
Oh, there's a rule of thumb that has to do
with how hot and dry it is
and what kind of fuel you're working in.
So it's totally variable depending on what you're doing.
Oh no, man, let me tell you, it didn't matter.
Not when it comes to what crew I was on.
They make us do the biggest damn line possible.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, totally, totally, no.
It'd be like, we gotta get a bulldozer down there.
So there's gotta be a bulldozer's width and stuff.
And anywhere that was scary to go,
they would send us,
like no other fire crews would be going down there,
or we should say free fire crews would go where we would go.
We would hike so many miles up mountains
and stuff is ridiculous.
Yeah.
And we'd have to work 24 hour shifts.
Yeah.
No, I ran, I didn't, when I was in California,
I wasn't so happy about it.
It made curious for various reasons.
And because we would sit there as free men
and watch the inmates drive right past us going,
well, why don't we get to work?
We only got paid when we worked, when we were in college.
Yeah, we were the backbone.
But it has a lot to do with like interagency agreements
and availability and things like that.
And we were-
I don't think that made us mad that we weren't,
like you guys didn't get to do,
all you guys did was drag hose and-
Well, and that's what, it's different crews.
That's what their job is.
It's just, it's like in the kitchen,
the chef's job isn't, is not mopping up afterwards.
Right?
And so-
We didn't get to mop up.
Or vice versa.
We never got to mop up.
Well-
It's like, when we ever get to mop up,
it was always the free fire crews
that were mopping up and everything.
And we're like, dude, now we gotta go bust their ass
on another one, go to another fire,
do another fire line.
Well, it's so backwards because as a free firefighter,
we always wanted the hotline
and the mop up was the lame shit to do.
But here's,
here's a-
Well, Dan, it was so hot and it was just crazy.
I went to college,
it was a study, it is a science.
Yeah.
Literally, here's some cool photography.
Let's see if I can change the settings around again.
Let's see, camera, there's me.
There's, is it that one?
All right, there we go.
Hold on, there we go.
Thank you, Peter.
Yep.
So the bulldozers, this is up in Wenatchee,
Wenatchee, Washington in 94.
Yeah, 94.
And so the bulldozer ran,
like across this ridge back here,
down here, but then-
There's fire all down here.
And so we coming down and you can see these folks here,
my brother's the guy in the furthest.
And he-
That's the mountain?
This is way up on top of mountain.
Yeah.
The Leavenworth, that's where we're,
Leavenworth, Wenatchee, Chelan, Washington.
Nice.
And so, yeah, there's, you know, way down in here,
there's a golf courses and houses down in the valley.
So we're up on the mountain.
And this bulldozer,
it's way up on the mountain.
And this bulldozer cut goes like this,
and it goes boop down the road.
And so that boop was over here in the top.
So we're standing up here, right?
We were doing this test fires right up in here.
If you can picture this.
So let me back up,
you can see both these pictures together.
And-
So that top picture is where all the free firefighters were
right there, see, that's all the-
This is that, there's just,
there's literally just the 20 of us college kids
and our boss.
Now do that lower picture.
See the firefighter, the fire crew is probably right,
the fire, the prison fire crews probably right in there.
There's no one else here but us.
Right where all that black is right there,
that's probably right where the inmate fire crew is.
Ain't no one here but us.
Nope, no inmates anywhere near us
for miles and miles on this fire.
That black right there.
There is no, there is no inmates on this.
This was literally,
I had just lit all this as a backfire actually.
So we were burning that and it lit up and the wind shifted.
And then I had to dive off of an eight foot embankment
in the barrier where the bulldozer cut was
and suck dirt for 10 minutes.
It was about nine minutes.
So the flames, literally 80 foot flames
were laid down over my head
and everyone around me thought I was dead.
And my brother watched the whole fucking thing.
And so, but I couldn't really breathe.
I was just kind of huffing.
My face was in this powder dust, right?
But it was bulldozer scraped out the hard soil.
And so-
You dug in, right?
Yeah, I just, I only had seconds.
You didn't shake and bake, did you?
You shake and bake?
I did not have time.
I had time to throw the drip torch
and dive into the dozer cut.
Literally, it was like eight seconds
from when the boss said,
"'Wind shift, get the fuck out of there'
till I had 20, 80 foot flames over my head.
And so again, that was just off the site.
I had the stickers on my helmet melted
and like the polypropylene jacket
or a shirt and my coat in the plastic bag
I had in to keep dry, all melted inside my backpack.
And there was burns.
There was burns on the back of my legs,
above my socks and boots,
between below my shoes.
Cause that was like a single layer exposure
with just one layer of, but yeah.
So that-
Is that you back there?
I'm taking the picture here.
I was checking my camera,
but he's the,
I think he's the lowest person on the mountain
at this point.
The rest of the crew is way the fuck up above.
Cause it just got so fucking hot.
And he came back down to make sure,
cause there's boulders coming flying down
through that shit constantly.
So he called Roxon seven times.
Literally just shaking myself out
after making sure I was still good to go live
and my camera worked.
Oh Jesus, dude.
Hey.
Oh yeah.
The sky crane.
Minutes later.
Yes.
We love those guys,
but sometimes they get water from shit ponds.
So you gotta watch out for that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Don't be going like this.
Yeah.
Ain't nothing nastier than that water.
And then also the stuff they put fires out,
tastes like matchsticks.
Whenever they use in that stuff,
that red, the orange stuff or red stuff.
Phosphorus.
Yeah.
It tastes like straight matchsticks.
Yeah, yeah.
Phosphorus.
It's phosphorus.
It's basically, yeah.
So, but it's,
it's clay and phosphorus.
It's like a clay fertilizer.
Yeah.
But the fire don't like burning with it.
That's for sure.
No, no, but we don't mind it at all.
I mean, it just sucks to get it on you.
Right.
It seems like they always try to hit you with it.
They're all like, there's a crew, let's get them.
I knew better,
but one time I actually called in one of those big giant
thousand gallons, sky crane water drops,
like just to hit me.
We got fire all in the rock I'm standing in.
And I'm like a big outcrop with like 80 foot cliff
beneath me.
And I'm like, I got fire all over in the crags of this rock
and all the rats nest.
You got to just,
and I knew it was coming.
I held onto the rock,
but just do the math with a thousand gallons,
eight pounds a gallon.
And he's dropping it a couple of hundred feet
and he's moving.
And I almost washed off that fucking cliff.
Usually they just try to cool you off.
So my first major fire was east of Stockton
is a bear mountain lake or valley or whatever,
they'll bear mountain.
It's over east of Stockton.
That fire, when we went in,
it was like my first major fire,
like my first big one.
And I go, I see everybody evacuating.
And this is my first big fire.
And we're like, as we're driving in,
we're like the whole mountain looks like it's on
like a giant volcano erupting and stuff.
And I'm like, holy crap, we're going in there.
Yep.
And everybody's leaving.
And God damn it.
What year?
What years were you doing that?
I don't know what the hell's going on with my head.
Chris, what?
I think his headphones shut off.
Uh-oh.
Yeah, one of them's been out.
You hear me?
He couldn't hear himself talking.
We can hear you.
Can you hear us?
Okay.
Yeah, I can hear you now.
My headphones are about to die.
But yeah, and when we were going in there,
I was like, holy crap.
And I was down there shitting myself
because I was just like,
we did little fires prior to that.
Little like 20 acre, 30, 40 acre fires and everything.
But then I had never been to a fire
where the whole mountain was on fire.
On that fire, I swear we had a bit of everything.
It burned over us.
The fire burned over us like what happened with you.
But we hid behind a fire truck.
We hid behind a fire truck.
And then we could see the fire go over us.
And we're like hunkered down.
And we could see the fire go over us.
The people that were in those fire trucks,
the people that were on the fire side,
their arm and everything from inside,
the radiant heat from inside,
their arms were burnt.
Their face was burnt.
All the stuff on the, everything that was,
anything that was plastic or anything
on the outside of that fire truck was all melted.
And everything, you could see the burnt scorch marks
on all like the seats and everything
that were out in the open.
Yeah, those were all scorched up and everything,
all crackled and stuff.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, it was some shit.
That was my first fire.
And then we went down
and it started burning all around us.
And we had to go run into the safety zone.
And shit, and it, dude, it was so hot.
All right, brother.
It was so hot.
Or what?
It was really, it was really.
Same piece of toad he said,
sorry about not being able to jump back on.
We didn't even know you were in the United States.
All right, so all right, so.
What years were these approximately?
What years were you working?
2001, 2002.
That's a huge, huge fire years.
2001.
Yeah, yeah.
Huge fire years.
Those are my last couple of years I worked.
Yeah, not compared to what we're having now.
It keeps getting bigger, keeps getting bigger, right?
Those were my last years.
So to me, those were just fucking huge years
because I've been watching it since the 80s.
My brother started in the 70s.
I started in 92.
Yeah, 2000, 2001, 2002.
Those years, I was finding that those were the biggest fires
they had to date.
I was out of Tahoe National Forest Fire
that was burning like, when we got there,
when we got there, it was like 25 acres or something,
50 acres, and it jumped to like 1,000 to 5,000
within an hour, and it just getting huger and huger
and huger.
We were at a mill that was over off of I-80
down by the Truckee River.
There's like a lumber mill that was made out of logs.
Hold on.
And it was just being built,
and you can imagine how much like wood,
extra wood that was,
because all the shaving, all the wood,
all the-
The log deck and the sawdust.
All the dust.
Westford Fire was a mill fire.
Yeah, so our job there was to make sure
that place didn't burn down.
And we made sure that place didn't burn down.
It was raining embers.
All of us had piss pumps on,
and every time an ember landed,
we hit it with the piss pump.
And it's just like a super soaker with a backpack.
Five gallons plus gear, but it's a 55-pound unit,
depending on if it's an older unit or bag.
I carried three of them fuckers once.
The one, the handle and stuff's made out of brass and shit.
It's like a really good-
The best super soaker toy ever.
Yeah, the best one ever.
This is literally the best.
Like if they were to make an industrial super soaker,
this is what I would be-
This is so fun.
You guys, you can get 30, 40 feet, no problem.
Just food, constantly.
You got five gallons on your back.
Yeah.
But that's not what you do with it.
You adjust the spray nozzle
depending on what you're working with.
It's a super fine spray for mop up,
or you got to squirt a hot spot or something,
and you can squirt far.
Yeah, so yeah, we did that on that one.
That was pretty awesome.
You get to do any backfiring ever?
Oh yeah.
Where you light up and burn out the road and stuff?
Oh yeah, yeah.
The one fire that I told you about that burnt over,
that's what they were doing.
They were shooting the little golf balls
and shit down there.
I used to have a...
It looks like a 22 shotgun pistol.
And basically you put a little starter pistol caps in it,
blank rounds basically.
But then it also had this thing
that looked like a ground balloon flower
or a 12 gauge shotgun shell.
It would fit in it.
And that fucking thing-
Ground balloon flower.
Holy shit, I haven't heard that in years.
You'd launch this thing,
and it could go a hundred yards,
and you could shoot it 40 yards,
and it would just blow up fucking sparks
and light a section on fire, right?
We had really fun tools like that for backfiring.
The funnest one I ever got to use
is directing the helicopters though.
And with the ping pong balls dropping out the back
of the catch on fire
or the barrel of diesel gas mixture,
and it's just dripping fire out the back.
You burn up all fucking-
The Delmar?
That sounds horrible.
No, no, the 55 gallon drums behind the helicopter.
So I did heli-tac for a few years,
and I did heli-rappeler.
And so we would work with the full on 55 gallon drum.
And it's two parts diesel, one part gasoline.
And then just add like the electro igniter.
You tell them where to lay the strips in
and burn them out and up.
We had to make that shit all the time.
We'd make that with our-
Right, right.
Yeah, we'd make it with our-
Drip torch, with a drip torch.
With a drip torch, exactly.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, we'd use a drip torch.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
That's what, yeah, I remember we would take it out of our,
because we had a CCV.
We'd take the gas out of the CCV,
and then we would use the gas for our chainsaws
to make the domar.
Because we'd have five gallon things of gas.
And then-
The jerry cans.
Yeah, the big cans of gas.
So we'd use that.
And then we'd use the diesel fuel to make it.
Yeah, I also hate doing control burns.
I really hate control burns,
because it's really smoky.
Because it's usually wet.
Oh, and it's wet, yeah.
Yeah, it's really smoky,
and you're getting smoked out.
Like, I think I got a lot of damage to my lungs.
Oh, definitely.
They don't let you wear any respirators,
because if they say, oh, it's safe,
it's all it is is wood and grass.
It's mostly large particulates.
You end up getting a lot of it over time,
and it definitely...
But seven years later, we got new lungs, you know?
And so I can't play that game anymore.
Yeah, yeah, dude.
Getting around, the worst though is we get around,
and someone's doing some illegal
fucking drug lavatory in the woods,
or just even a car, a shed, a couch,
any of that shit.
We would see that shit.
We would see the labs that they would leave
in the middle of the forest.
Yeah, yeah.
We would see those,
and we'd have to call a cleanup crew
to come clean it up,
because of the chemicals and everything
that they were dealing with.
Right, right.
No, that's why they wanted me to be a law enforcement
on the hot shot crew, to deal with that kind of shit,
and I didn't know that,
and I left that job to come to Utah
to run the inmate crew,
where I had my own toolbox of fire...
Guys who I could train to be awesome firefighters each year,
and go out and do good,
instead of just me swinging a shovel or whatever.
But that...
So here's the whole other thing.
That's something I've been seeing in these reports,
and they're like real news reports
coming out of California,
and this affects all of us,
and we talk about these illegal operations,
and yes, I specifically was talking about
meth and crack operations and shit,
they were quite prevalent out in the woods in California,
but there's also huge amounts of black market mafia,
and the mom mafia grows,
they're doing a whole bunch of damage
to both our environment,
and our entire nation of free market cannabis,
people who have licenses are being hurt by it,
and such as well,
and...
Man, have you heard anything...
What's his name?
Or hey...
God, something, Jorge something,
he's talking about the Hmong community,
the Russians, and the Chinese.
Well, there's a whole bunch of organized crime,
and in California right now,
it's only $500 if you got three or four or five houses,
right?
And they just give everyone a ticket.
The owners are gone,
and it's a bunch of salt girls and stuff,
and they're doing large tonnage of this,
and they're human trafficking and stuff like that,
it's going on as well.
So, I don't know,
know your grower,
know your supply.
Yeah, it's unbelievable.
Right?
Now, on the far end,
they used to be coming in here in Utah,
and there's the joke about the DEA guy,
when they were trying to bring medical here,
that was talking about the stone rabbits in Utah,
and it's a fun meme,
but the other thing that guy talked about
was the environmental damage
that the illegal operations do,
because they don't give a fuck,
and it kind of sucks.
And they don't give a shit what they're spraying,
I'm sure.
Like, my interviews are smoking probably gallons of Eagle 20
and I know when I lived down in Utah,
I was growing up on California weed for sure,
and who knows how much of it was grown from slaves
who knows where.
I don't think much of it was,
but nowadays I think most of my stuff
was definitely like NorCal,
a lot of hippie girls,
and maybe some crime networks up there,
but nowadays it's just like shit.
I wouldn't smoke it down there off the black market,
because it's a huge chance it's coming from
some Chinese slaves or some damn Mexican slaves,
spraying God knows what.
It's for everybody,
but it's kind of messed up
how some of those mafia operations
take advantage of people, right?
And that in alone itself and the pollution that occurs
because people don't give a fuck.
Yeah, I was,
what's the northernmost county in California?
Del Norte, I think, no, wait.
Temple.
Seemed like a-
Why, Rika?
No, wait, wait, that's just, hold on.
I wanna say Siskiyou, but I don't think that's,
I fought fire right up on the fucking border
up there once, but I couldn't tell you exactly.
I've been right in the northeast corner,
and we weren't sure if we were in Oregon
or California most of the time,
but that's 30 years ago.
Watching some interviews with this guy
that he's just really concentrated on this issue
of this stuff, and there's like thousands of grows
in this one county that only has like a couple sheriffs
to handle the,
God, I keep getting messages in my bed.
Yeah, to handle the problem of all these illegal grows
from all these criminal organizations.
Well, they're pulling guns on everyone too, right?
Yeah, robbing water, doing just everything.
I guess the biggest crime they're noticing,
like they're not noticing much homicides
because people just disappear and they're all illegal anyway
whether they're Asian or Hispanic or what,
but the biggest crime they've noticed
where they're actually got a person in custody
is hands being chopped off.
Like finding fuckers running into people's houses,
some illegal Chinese, Mexican, something enslaved
on one of these farms with that missing hand.
There was a case recently in Oklahoma
where a fellow shot five or six people
and they ran off to Florida, I think,
and they caught him back over in Florida
and that was all Chinese mafia,
illegal operation in Oklahoma.
All right, so the top three-
Mr. Gorski joined us.
What'd you guys think?
So I was right on the very top Northern
over by Oregon by the ocean is Del Norte.
Right.
But the one beside Del Norte is Siskiyou.
Yeah.
And the one beside Siskiyou, what is it?
Siskiyou, sorry, Siskiyou.
I thought you said Siskiyou.
Is Siskiyou a desert looking-
It's Siskiyou.
Siskiyou.
Maybe on the Eastern portion.
Modoc.
Modoc, okay.
Modoc is square.
Square County is completely square up in the corner.
Lassen's below that, South of it.
And Lassen's below that.
Shasta's to the right, to the left of that.
Trinity's to the left and then Humboldt.
I guess.
Those are like the top of the counties right up there.
The Mendocino is right below that.
Yeah, this journalist came out
with this documentary called Cartel Bill.
And I haven't watched it.
I think that's the Dream Triangle.
I think you have to like subscribe
to whatever their thing is.
But I've watched a lot of his interviews
and that's like his whole focus is like
covering this issue of these poor people
enslaved to these illegal weed grows.
And it's definitely off the chain.
Well, that's why you don't wanna get involved
with those dudes.
Don't get, like seriously,
just feel for those people that get,
they get all, you know,
mixed up with those people.
Any of the, let's just say gangs,
any of them.
Yeah, I think you do.
It just sucks to get mixed up with them
and then they're in your life
and then you have to deal with that.
It sucks.
And sometimes, yeah.
The other year, a few years back,
probably three years ago or so,
they think they busted like a series of like
80 something grow houses all ran by Chinese
organized crime out in Seattle.
Yeah.
What's going on guys?
You know who?
You shopping?
No, man, I'm closing up shop.
I'm an assistant store manager
at the grocery store in Telluride.
Nice.
Oh, nice.
Yeah.
So just trying to get the store down
before I get out of here.
Telluride.
Isn't Telluride like the highest L1?
The highest elevation city in the US?
That's Leadville, Colorado.
Telluride's way up there too, right?
Yeah.
Telluride is very high.
I think Leadville's got the highest post office.
Oh, okay.
So like, I think it's like the highest post office
in the nation.
I'm through with Leadville, it's pretty small.
Well, not anymore, man.
It's about to be.
Yeah, 22 was the last time I drove through there.
Yeah, like-
Oh, two, oh, two.
I'm sorry, 20 years ago.
Yeah, I kind of figured what you meant, Hardy.
But yeah, it's sort of like,
sorry, there's really bad boy band music,
so that's why my face is so close to the camera.
But yeah, the price per square foot
is just shot through the fucking roof.
Like everybody's Vale and Beaver Creek sprawl.
Right, right.
And this Telluride place, like I work up here,
but I live in Montrose,
so that takes me like an hour and a half
to get home every day.
Wow.
You get to hang out for the Mushroom Festival though.
This year I will, man.
And hopefully, what's his name will be here?
Just the Sammies.
Yeah, Paul Sammets.
He was here last year.
Our reporter on the spot.
Yeah, he was here last year,
and then hopefully I'll have like
some stuff going on from Sacred Three Mushrooms to Nasi.
He's got, I think, eight more types
that I want to get from him.
And he's also got some substrate and other things.
So all in all, it seems like a pretty cool deal to get that.
I already got a starter kit,
and I'm gonna inoculate that sooner than later.
I just got a lot of shit on my plate right now.
You see people working with any of the more like
exotic species out there?
So if you say DP.
What's that?
Oh, dude, if you get to the Sacred Three Mushrooms
on his email, or if you hit him up on his Instagram,
I try to keep it like,
I don't talk about anything on Instagram
just because the AI understands
if you're doing business or not.
So I just emailed him instead.
But if you get his email, he had nine different strains.
And then he has, I believe, inoculated substrate
for a reasonable price.
And that's-
Oh, I just mean if you see,
like you hear about anything other than your average,
like it seems like everybody out there is working Cubensis.
Oh yeah, Cubensis.
He's got the Cubensis,
but the things that he has are pretty darn cool.
Those .25s that teach cannabis project are,
well, I should say Dagadoc Garden had
for just a limited time.
My wife and I, we take one of those, man.
We started feeling fuzzy.
I started getting the yawns.
I started fucking giggling.
I was like, are you fucking kidding me off a .25, what?
So I took two one night on the way home
and it was the white something.
I can't, I think it was the,
oh man, I'm not even gonna fuck it up.
But anyways, I took two and I drove home
and halfway there on the Dallas Divide, man,
I started looking up at the stars and they were like 3D.
And I stood there for like a half an hour
or two and I was spinning around like, whoa,
this is pretty cool for just .5.
Yeah, I wanna see people really start working
the Mexicana species out there.
According to like the South Mexican tribes
that really like have the knowledge
and all a lot of the original practices,
they would use these Mexicana species.
And I've worked with them myself.
Their fruits are just wicked.
They're not as pretty, that's for sure.
Cause they're a little skinny guys,
but they also produce the sclerotia, like the truffles.
Yeah.
You ever hear about the truffles out there?
Well, I heard about the truffles through Vice.
They had an episode where they were in a gym
and that's the only thing they're allowed to have nowadays.
Yeah, they're like the legal loophole of no fruit bodies,
just truffles and yeah.
Yeah, but I mean like, I'm into anything right now.
And when DP was talking to that young lady
that has been on a couple of different times
and she was talking about the DMT
and all those other things.
And I'm like, fuck dude, that stuff sounds amazing.
I was hanging out in the Golden Triangle in Denver
and I was eating like Molly, mushrooms,
and acid all together and going to dance clubs
and scaring people.
Cause I was the guy sweating in the corner,
just like dancing, wearing a tie-dye to a nightclub
where everybody's all wearing a button up
and I'm fucking having a good time,
listening to Paul Oakenfold.
And I was just listening to all these other,
like, you know, just electronic music,
just finding my vibe and then walking around
at two, four in the morning,
handing out $20 bills to like the skinniest homeless guys.
They've been like, don't let it go away, dude.
Like, you know, and wait until I was sober to drive.
So like six in the morning,
but you used to be able to walk around Denver.
Nowadays, I don't advise that at all.
Well, I mean, like I was tripping and shit, man.
So like, I didn't have that like rob me vibe.
I kind of had that like,
who is that character over there?
Like, and I mean, I'm six foot tall.
I don't think anybody would want to try to rob me
cause I had that just, don't fuck with me,
I won't fuck with you.
But if you do fuck with me, we're going down.
Like-
When you're tripping, you put that energy out too.
Yeah.
I was just saying-
People don't want to fuck with you when you're tripping.
Yeah, I was just, I mean, like I would be singing
and rapping and just making weird noises
if people would be laughing and I'd get them to laugh with me
and if there was any like homeless people,
I would give them money.
And I just like to walk around the alleys
and just be a dipshit and just trip my balls off
until I was sober.
And then I'd get back in the car
and do it a couple of times a week.
You know, in Denver-
I was walking alone in Denver
my first time there or second time there.
And I didn't realize I walked into like the wrong part
and I was just stoned and drinking a little bit
and just having fun.
And man, I got chased by a real life zombie.
Like this dude was screaming like a zombie.
He was all, it's like he sends my heat signature
from like a hundred yards away.
And I seen this, I could just sense his like malevolence
and I'm like, what the hell?
This fucker screaming off in the distance
and then sure as hell he starts sprinting at me
and stuff.
I'm like, fuck.
What year was that, man?
That was 2000.
Hold on, let's see, 2019 maybe, 2019-ish.
Yes, it's all fucking, it's all gone downhill, man.
When we moved back in 95 in the Colorado,
I was like 96, I think I was getting a sheet
for like 200 bucks.
And then a little later on in like 2001, 2002,
my buddy got some Molly.
He didn't even know what it was.
So he just gave it to me.
And then my other buddy had some mushrooms.
So I had some paper and some Molly and some mushrooms
and I'd just go down to the clubs and have some good times.
But that was people fucked up 16th street mall.
And before we went green,
because right when we went green,
that's when all the dipshits from all the other states
with their EBT cards came in
and were like buying food at one grocery store
and trading it in at another grocery store
and then buying the weed.
So, I've been on that shit before.
In the mountains, when you get laid off
for a month and a half, that's when you go on vacation
and then you come back to the same job.
So I'm not trying to say it's a bad thing,
but some people abuse that system.
Yeah, I picked up a friend just a couple of years ago,
whenever the, like all that,
all the Black Lives Riots or whatever went on,
we didn't realize what had happened in Denver.
Oh yeah.
I didn't think it like hit Denver.
We didn't care.
We were kind of out of the loop.
We didn't really thinking about it.
We drove up in there and we're kind of just in the heart
of Denver, arrived late night.
And that was pretty wild.
There were some people,
there were some real crazy gangster activity going on.
And my buddy thought it was all cool.
He's like, yeah, no, we can smoke a joint here
right outside of this wild ass house party
where everybody's got a fifth in their hand
and they're all in the same color and like,
just gangster shit.
And I'm like, dude, no,
we got to go to the other side of the street
and keep going.
Cause one of the motherfuckers just catches eye contact.
That's going to be an issue.
It's like, they were just looking to fuck shit up out there.
Yeah.
I had some friends, well, acquaintances
that I used to grow with when I worked down in Denver
and they were one of those like motorcycle
slash dirt bike gangs that would go out like,
well in 20, 30 deep.
Yeah, those are,
that's the first time I've ever seen them was in Denver.
Yeah. They're from Aurora, dude.
Saudi Aurora.
So they're not,
there's a different demograph out there, man.
People like to pick fights.
That mall out there is known for like pretty bad shit.
Although, I mean, I got stabbed in Highlands Ranch.
So it doesn't matter where you are.
You could be in Uppity,
this County where I used to live.
I went to Highlands Ranch High School.
But I graduated in 97.
And yeah, man, but it doesn't matter where you are.
You can find trouble if you're really looking for it.
Oh yeah, definitely.
Alcohol in your system that you usually find trouble.
Yeah.
No, man, I only got 9% on my phone.
I'm gonna drive down and go check on the garden.
I just saw Hardy.
I'd never been on a live with you before, Chris.
I haven't seen your face in forever.
Thank you for jumping on.
You too.
Yeah.
You know, I still have my show.
It's on the FCP3 now.
And I don't have that on my YouTube.
Thanks for the heads up.
I'll definitely try to-
Yeah, at FCP3.
All right.
Like go onto the YouTube head channel thing.
It'll go at FCP3.
And I do, I've been like, just to put it in perspective,
an hour and a half to get to work,
an hour and a half back.
So that's three hours.
And then basically 10 to 12 hours at work, five days a week.
So I'm not, I mean, I'm watering my plants.
I fucked up the other day.
I was cleaning up my grow.
And I left my plants outside for a couple hours,
like three to four hours.
And it got down to 10 degrees or five degrees, man.
I killed my citronella plant.
I killed my rubber tree.
I killed my fucking-
Oh.
Yeah.
Are the root wads dead?
What's that?
Sorry.
I got a nasal thing going.
Is the root wad dead?
I think it'll come back.
It's all sad, dude.
It looks like it's all limp, you know?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Now sometimes the root wad survives, you know,
if you got it in before the whole soil froze around it.
I have that happen when my heater fails in the greenhouse
because it's too hot during the day, it shuts off.
Yeah.
And I don't check it.
I bought some peppers
and then they sprout back from the root base.
Yeah.
Thank God you can overwinter the peppers, man.
Yeah.
You're a work.
Watching some of your lives, Hardy, man.
The other day he had your shirt off and shit.
You're having a good day, man.
You goofy son of a gun, you.
Man, I'm digging your vibe, dude.
Thanks so much.
Thank you.
Yeah.
What was funny-
This morning, he made my morning by dressing up as-
I didn't know that he was-
I didn't know that he had put the little picture up
beforehand, like, for his thing.
I didn't know that.
I just, I was like, oh shit, he's dressed like a gnome.
I saw it right away.
I was like, he's a gnome.
Whatever.
I was like, that's what I made my morning.
Yeah, sorry, Chris.
I didn't mean to cut you off.
No, that was okay.
Wow, you're a community and shit, dude.
Nah, man, I'm digging your vibe, dude.
I think the last one I saw, like, more of the episode,
it was when you had the bicycle wheel.
It probably was like six, seven months ago,
the bicycle wheel, and you were going
through your compost pile.
Right, right.
And the latest one I saw was you,
gorilla beat in your chest,
being fit without a shirt on.
Someone told me to put a shirt on.
I was like, ah, freedom, yeah.
You were like, woo, I'm fit.
Hey, at least you weren't interviewing a woman, okay?
What's that matter, dude?
They throw their tits out every fucking chance they get.
Hey, man, hey, but at least he wasn't interviewing a woman.
My favorite self-denial.
He was all by himself.
We gotta free the nipple.
Yeah.
Free the nipple, I agree.
My neighbors all think I have a smoker's cough
because I get this sinus drip going,
and it seems like I'm, sorry.
Hey, how's that job going, Hardy?
What's going on?
Are you done?
Over.
There are multiple issues,
but the final straw was they scheduled me 10 days straight
without telling me.
Oh, yeah, kitchen bullshit.
My body needed rest, and I showed up on day six,
and by day seven, it was literally like,
guys, this is like, you don't understand how fucked up I am.
I didn't even apply to this job.
You put me into this position.
I didn't ask for this,
and at the same time, I'm going through this shit
with my hand, it's fucked up.
Don't even know really, but there's a big old lump
in my hand, and it's pinched on the ulnar nerve,
so I can't even do other work.
It's fucked, dude.
So, gotta figure it out and make it work.
And-
Are they still gonna operate on it?
No, they did two MRIs and came back,
and they're like, well, it's not a cyst.
It's not a tumor.
Well, what is it?
Like, maybe it's a swollen muscle.
I'm like, well, which muscle?
And she just said, keep stretching it.
And I extended it.
It's like, it hasn't changed for basically
two and a half months now.
Since December, it got like really big,
and now it's just gotten a little softer,
but it's the same size, and it...
Today, for the first time,
I put the electroshock tens unit
on either side of my hand, where the lump is,
to see if that's gonna be any different when I wake up.
But it takes me two hours to be able to do this
in the morning right now, because of this lump in my hand,
and that's from work.
So, that's how it turned out for me.
I got a little bit of money in my bank account,
but...
My hands crippled from getting stabbed,
and then a tree fell on my finger,
so I lost my pinky.
So, I can do that.
That's the movement I got in this hand.
And then, that's the difference.
Right?
I feel you, bro.
I fucked myself up pretty good,
then I go to work flipping burgers,
and lose my right hand usage completely.
It's like, yeah, I got like 30%.
I can't open the front door with my right hand.
It's that someone shake my hand,
and I got pulled over.
I gotta go, guys.
Peace out.
Yeah, no, it's all good for the night.
I gotta get to sleep.
Yeah, Peter's taking over.
He's right here.
I just put Gemma to sleep.
Sorry.
I'm gonna do a quick dab, and we'll call it a night.
The dab, the Petester.
All right.
I hope you guys made it on here.
I'll play a little music while you watch me dab.
There we go.
He'll do our outro music.
Can you play Strange Brew?
No.
Can you play Kenny G?
No.
So I like playing really short little,
like I almost call them like a sonnet
or a haiku on the flute, right?
Where you keep it really short and simple like that.
There's other ones that goes long,
and I call it the four seasons,
and I keep playing, and it rises and falls,
and keeps on going.
But I used to sleep outdoors a lot,
and I'd walk around at dawn
and just play those little short 30 second little haikus
to nature.
Remember Dennis Leary,
he called me a haiku-write motherfucker.
Anyways, much love.
Peter, great to see you, man.
Thank you so much, dude.
You're fucking amazing.
Shout out to you.
Thank you.
You are too.
Don't sell yourself short.
Yeah.
It's super, super cool, man.
I'm fucking stoked with all this stuff I have.
I can't wait for spring.
I'm gonna be fucking handful of helicopters, baby.
Yeah, dude.
Well.
All right.
Well, everyone have a good night.
Good to see you.
Yeah, catch you.
Hey, everybody.
Later.
Go ahead, you can click it off the end.
