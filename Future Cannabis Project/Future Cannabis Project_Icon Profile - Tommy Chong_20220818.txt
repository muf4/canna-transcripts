[00:01.530 --> 00:12.690]  Hey man. Surprise it's just me. It's just Peter you all have been masterly trolled.
[00:12.690 --> 00:17.210]  Do you think Tommy Chong would honestly talk to me? Long-haired tie-dye wearing
[00:17.210 --> 00:23.250]  hippie? Yes he will. We're having some problems today guys. We're sorry. We have
[00:23.250 --> 00:27.690]  Wi-Fi issues. Yes we are blaming the solar flares and for once that's
[00:27.690 --> 00:34.370]  actually an appropriate thing. So we were just on the phone. I'm sweating guys. We
[00:34.370 --> 00:39.210]  were just on the phone with his manager and this is going to be happening next
[00:39.210 --> 00:45.210]  Thursday. So unfortunately today is kind of a bust. Oh it breaks my heart
[00:45.210 --> 00:50.130]  especially with the anticipation and everybody showing up. All the love on
[00:50.130 --> 00:55.690]  Instagram. People have been looking forward to this. Me too. But you know what
[00:55.690 --> 01:00.970]  a lot of things are out of our controls and even their controls and that's kind
[01:00.970 --> 01:08.930]  of one of the things we did today is we came across it. So we are rescheduled for
[01:08.930 --> 01:13.770]  next Thursday. There will be a Tommy Chong interview. I guess that leaves you
[01:13.770 --> 01:18.570]  guys plenty of time to get your questions in. I've got some fun questions
[01:18.570 --> 01:22.690]  but if you guys want to leave some questions in the comments or we I don't
[01:22.690 --> 01:24.970]  know if we're we'll probably just delete this. I don't know what we're
[01:24.970 --> 01:35.250]  doing. Or just on your IG. Yeah on my IG. DM chat or somehow get the questions in.
[01:35.250 --> 01:40.770]  It's only an hour so he has to get all his questions in first. But yeah good
[01:40.770 --> 01:45.690]  questions. Well while we're here though Peter what is a good email for people
[01:45.690 --> 01:49.410]  that want to contact the channel or just Doggett in general with their questions
[01:49.410 --> 01:57.010]  or their requests? It's actually questions at Daggett.love. Nice okay because I do get
[01:57.010 --> 02:00.730]  that one fairly often. People are like what's a good contact for Peter? How can
[02:00.730 --> 02:11.610]  I reach out and touch somebody? I think I is this this is yours. Oh yeah you can
[02:12.450 --> 02:20.050]  We can hear you. Unmute thyself. Alright let me see because I think. Alright I'm gonna
[02:20.050 --> 02:27.970]  switch to let's see if it's still here. Banners. Oh you know what another thing
[02:27.970 --> 02:33.690]  that people have been loving lately is the seed collector shows. And I
[02:33.690 --> 02:40.770]  absolutely love them and appreciate them for that. I happened to get a little box
[02:40.890 --> 02:49.330]  today. I have a box for you too. Oh boy it's Christmas. Yeah someone mailed it to
[02:49.330 --> 02:52.810]  me and was like can you send it up to Chad and I was like why didn't you just
[02:52.810 --> 03:00.490]  send it to Chad directly. Okay I actually I think I might know who that is. I'll
[03:00.490 --> 03:04.130]  talk to you about that one I just wanted to make sure there's nothing no plant
[03:04.130 --> 03:11.090]  material in there or anything like that because I can't do that here. Okay but so
[03:11.090 --> 03:18.530]  so to make up for the scheduling snafu with Tommy next Thursday it will be
[03:18.530 --> 03:24.210]  guys next Thursday I'm gonna show off some beans here real quick and I have to
[03:24.210 --> 03:28.650]  shout out joint. I want to shout out James he was the guest on the last seed
[03:28.650 --> 03:35.770]  collectors volume 7. You know we had some fun talks we definitely hit it off
[03:35.770 --> 03:40.490]  and there were there were a few strains that we had in common. So we're gonna
[03:40.490 --> 03:46.090]  start this off first thing up right now we got a black lime number two times the
[03:46.090 --> 03:50.490]  cherry limeade f5. Now this is a little bit different than the black lime
[03:50.490 --> 03:56.330]  reserve. This is the black lime which is one of the parental units on that but
[03:56.330 --> 04:01.770]  then the cherry limeade is that super duper one of those males from I believe
[04:01.770 --> 04:08.050]  it was mean gene. So we got that and also in there the the ghost OG times got
[04:08.050 --> 04:15.010]  skyjaro which is an awesome pack in itself. Starting my mean gene
[04:15.010 --> 04:24.050]  freeborn selections collection just right. Got those and another one in that
[04:24.050 --> 04:28.530]  you all know that I've been growing Kool-Aid man from belief digging his
[04:28.530 --> 04:37.530]  stuff. This is a very old sought-after pack the creature s1 fem from belief
[04:37.530 --> 04:44.970]  cannabis. This is actually the male of the Kool-Aid man that I have. So these
[04:44.970 --> 04:49.570]  are gonna be pretty badass. My hands are hot just touching them I'm
[04:49.570 --> 04:54.810]  sweating that's why I'm sweating guys it's not because I said I was gonna have
[04:54.810 --> 04:59.570]  a Tommy Chong here today but that's coming next Thursday next Thursday solar
[04:59.570 --> 05:06.810]  flares world cats and dogs getting getting together. Fire fire fire. Is that
[05:06.810 --> 05:12.770]  on this is that on maybe channel 2 did Chris block you I don't know but if you
[05:12.770 --> 05:20.770]  can clarify I don't think I've blocked anyone. Questions at Daga dot love and

[05:37.810 --> 05:42.330]  I'm gonna bust those out again but the next seed collectors episode next month
[05:42.330 --> 05:51.770]  is gonna be more fire and I hope to see everybody there but these are black bird

[07:40.820 --> 07:49.900]  stuff is like he the last one was a lot of lemon Thai crosses hold on yeah no
[07:49.900 --> 07:53.780]  worries. Oh thanks everybody in chat again for
[07:53.780 --> 08:00.420]  showing up sorry that it didn't work out today a variety of issues but solar
[08:00.420 --> 08:06.300]  flares next Thursday next Thursday is the date we're gonna get it done we were
[08:06.300 --> 08:11.380]  talking with the manager early before we went on live I couldn't let you down
[08:11.380 --> 08:16.660]  so we're here just just for a moment to bullshit and show you some seeds Peter's
[08:16.660 --> 08:21.820]  got the mad mad stash going right now because I know another one that you just
[08:21.820 --> 08:30.300]  uploaded to the Daga garden website was South Bay genetics correct? Oh you didn't
[08:30.300 --> 08:34.100]  have your headphones on I just like did a long question you didn't have it
[08:34.100 --> 08:39.180]  another person that we've just got on to the website as well was the South Bay
[08:39.180 --> 08:42.620]  genetics correct? Who may be watching right now
[08:42.620 --> 08:49.300]  Flora Nugs yeah I believe he is he's usually watching the shows so we got a
[08:49.300 --> 08:52.700]  lot of stuff going on let's see let me let me blow you up here let me play
[08:52.700 --> 08:57.460]  producer yeah oh that's the long one that nobody could
[08:57.460 --> 09:04.380]  pronounce mullum in B or something yeah the mullum bid me to step and then kind
[09:04.380 --> 09:18.640]  of like just straight stuff Vietnamese black and we got lemon Thai and then we
[09:18.640 --> 09:35.850]  got ruby vine Afghani now when he sends you these is he actually one of the
[09:35.850 --> 09:40.970]  people who will send descriptions or maybe a little bit about the lineage
[09:40.970 --> 09:49.970]  with that to go up on the website or what once I let me actually go into hold
[09:56.120 --> 10:02.680]  we got hash slinging hasher in the chat saying that the the pack you just
[10:02.680 --> 10:05.720]  scratched your head and then you touch the pack so it's gonna have some of your
[10:05.720 --> 10:12.160]  skin on it which means he can clone the DNA and replicate Peters so that's that
[10:12.160 --> 10:16.800]  might be the way we have an operator standing by as if we clone yes so the
[10:16.800 --> 10:22.320]  mullum bin be to step you know he says this here is twice back cross version of
[10:22.320 --> 10:27.480]  mullum bin be madness originally worked by Ken get Eva of IC mag fame the initial
[10:27.480 --> 10:33.920]  Oh cross use yeah so he does have he gives like the backstory of it but
[10:33.920 --> 10:38.520]  usually when he sends the seeds he never sends info so then I have to be like hey
[10:38.520 --> 10:47.320]  a ton of stuff just arrived but I don't I don't have any descriptions so here's
[10:47.440 --> 10:55.400]  that's the Puna Puna Oh Wow Puno butter times nl5 and all the lights all right I

[12:37.160 --> 12:41.800]  some other stuff that he was working at that time so yeah no those are fresh
[12:41.800 --> 12:45.640]  ones and I'd love to you know again I love the seed conversations I love the
[12:45.640 --> 12:51.680]  breeder conversations we need to need to get into more of that stuff

[13:27.300 --> 13:37.460]  what you're in LA he's in LA y'all are both having internet issues see see see
[13:39.700 --> 13:46.660]  so anyway before I drop these bins hold on yeah before you drop all your not
[13:46.660 --> 13:55.260]  gonna be lettuce seeds to don't drop those man I can look down like I can
[13:55.260 --> 14:01.180]  look down right now yeah and pick up a seat off the floor I have random floor
[14:01.180 --> 14:16.620]  seats yet no I had a where are you these were under there yeah and I was like I
[14:16.620 --> 14:24.540]  have no idea what this is totally done that so totally well okay I'm like it
[14:24.540 --> 14:36.100]  must have been something good yes see this yeah I have no idea what crosses is
[14:36.100 --> 14:43.860]  oh yeah I have a ton of that I'm pretty sure it's the Westport grape juice but
[14:43.860 --> 14:46.900]  this was also in a shoe box for probably eight or nine months and I had
[14:46.900 --> 14:51.940]  forgot about it and then as I was moving stuff around I was like oh yeah I've got
[14:51.940 --> 14:57.580]  the seeded weed here see that to me that kind of looks like the Westport grape
[14:57.580 --> 15:04.060]  juice versus what I was running other it's got some purple in it but these
[15:04.060 --> 15:07.980]  just might wind up as the freebie some freebies on the on the dog a site
[15:07.980 --> 15:15.100]  because I'm not exactly sure what the cross what did I do I didn't write it on
[15:15.100 --> 15:24.910]  that bag when I put it in a shoe box oh geez is that all seated too so before we
[15:24.910 --> 15:29.350]  went live I was talking about how I'm excited for as Gemma gets older to be
[15:29.350 --> 15:33.990]  able to help out with more stuff but to basically get her fingers in there and
[15:33.990 --> 15:39.150]  break everything up so I can put it through the winnower and then her
[15:39.150 --> 15:48.270]  fingers can be all sticky I want a winnower but I have a hard time getting
[15:48.270 --> 15:53.750]  it dry enough to like crumble this one doesn't have a ton of it but that's
[15:53.750 --> 15:59.830]  yeah that one's gonna be easier it's still deceiving is really kind of a
[15:59.830 --> 16:06.630]  beast man that's why I just let it dry the fuck yeah this one does not much in
[16:06.630 --> 16:09.870]  it too but then I have some outside that are like the bigger bins and those
[16:09.870 --> 16:19.230]  are total mystery shit from like at Tom's house I'll be like what's that
[16:19.230 --> 16:22.670]  plant over there and he's like I don't know like it must have just popped up
[16:22.670 --> 16:28.190]  from the ground and I'm like dude in the month that I wasn't here you have a
[16:28.190 --> 16:37.030]  plant that popped up and so anyway there's lots of random plants that have
[16:37.030 --> 16:45.110]  been seated yes volunteer plants those are affectionately the Peter beans so
[16:45.110 --> 16:48.670]  I'll have different generations there'll be like Peter beans one Peter beans to
[16:48.670 --> 16:55.230]  Peter beans three four or five now kind of speaking of Peter beans this was
[16:55.230 --> 17:00.150]  something I caught wind of the other day I know we had talked about sending
[17:00.150 --> 17:05.150]  some seeds that you can use for you know veterans or for people you know just med
[17:05.150 --> 17:11.990]  patients anybody in need really and then Chris was mentioning is it like ten
[17:11.990 --> 17:18.990]  dollars and one cents get to send out a pack of seeds or gets a person a pack of
[17:18.990 --> 17:24.150]  seeds how is that working it's yeah it's ten bucks and then I just put in like a
[17:24.430 --> 17:32.790]  bunch of packs and a bunch of nutrients and a bunch of other stuff and send it
[17:32.790 --> 17:38.510]  out so cool okay so there's doing doing good things though you know there's a
[17:38.510 --> 17:43.430]  lot of people you know veterans that we like to support medicinal patients we
[17:43.430 --> 17:48.790]  like to support you know it's it's not easy when you have to make RSO or
[17:48.790 --> 17:54.230]  edibles and you don't have you know enough to grow that's a that's an issue
[17:54.230 --> 18:00.150]  yeah I mean the the medium term goal would also be to send flour out because
[18:00.150 --> 18:04.830]  it's kind of like until it you won't be able to do anything with this for the
[18:04.830 --> 18:10.550]  next six months so until then or or even stuff that's processed right like so
[18:10.550 --> 18:16.230]  here's some oil which is a little more discreet to ship but I feel like
[18:16.230 --> 18:23.150]  shipping yeah mr. toad he's the one who donated the bulk of nice seed so far
[18:23.150 --> 18:29.830]  nice full duplex gnome automatic I think is gonna send a bunch of stuff for that
[18:29.830 --> 18:33.950]  and I've started to talk to some like it's kind of like as I talk to a
[18:33.950 --> 18:40.150]  breeder and run the idea by them they're like fuck yeah but like I have no time
[18:40.150 --> 18:49.630]  to be like let me call every breeder up an operator is standing by yeah no
[18:49.630 --> 18:57.390]  that's that's that's cool though I'm glad that that's option is there is for
[18:57.390 --> 19:02.790]  mr. Chong nice to see you bro yeah tomorrow or not tomorrow next Thursday
[19:02.790 --> 19:08.690]  next Thursday we're gonna get it done he's actually in the chat right now mr.

[20:18.810 --> 20:22.890]  work up to 22 that could be a good goal as well I mean we're on day 15 and
[20:22.890 --> 20:27.650]  already you know all of us are feeling those physical improvements and a lot of
[20:27.650 --> 20:31.170]  times when you feel those physical improvements it's a mental improvement
[20:31.170 --> 20:35.170]  as well it's you know it's routine it's something to look forward to it's
[20:35.170 --> 20:38.370]  something that's gonna make you feel good and I'm glad that we've had so many
