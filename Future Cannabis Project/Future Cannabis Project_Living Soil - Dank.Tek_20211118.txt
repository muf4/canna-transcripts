[00:00.000 --> 00:01.300]  Live button when it up.
[00:02.160 --> 00:03.600]  All right. And we are live.
[00:03.600 --> 00:05.580]  So we got our guest imminently
[00:05.580 --> 00:07.340]  coming on. So Brian's going to set
[00:07.340 --> 00:08.840]  the table. Take it away, Brian.
[00:09.320 --> 00:10.480]  Yeah. Good morning, Living Soil
[00:10.480 --> 00:11.920]  Nerds. Happy Thursday to you.
[00:12.560 --> 00:14.620]  Just a little little things
[00:14.620 --> 00:16.000]  behind the scenes that made it a
[00:16.000 --> 00:16.960]  little bit later today.
[00:16.960 --> 00:18.300]  But a shout out to you guys always
[00:18.300 --> 00:19.300]  rocking with us.
[00:19.360 --> 00:20.960]  It is a little bit different to do
[00:20.960 --> 00:22.160]  live TV all the time.
[00:22.840 --> 00:24.580]  But our guest today, I feel like is
[00:24.600 --> 00:26.540]  somebody that maybe
[00:26.560 --> 00:28.360]  doesn't have that same clout on
[00:28.360 --> 00:30.040]  Instagram for whatever reason.
[00:30.080 --> 00:31.420]  I know he's been around for a long
[00:31.420 --> 00:32.360]  time.
[00:32.360 --> 00:33.720]  When I was doing research on him, it
[00:33.720 --> 00:35.180]  seems like he started to actually
[00:35.680 --> 00:37.740]  show himself and show himself
[00:37.760 --> 00:39.800]  growing in around
[00:39.800 --> 00:41.060]  2015.
[00:41.400 --> 00:42.780]  As things have progressed, I've
[00:42.780 --> 00:44.460]  continued to watch his account grow
[00:44.480 --> 00:45.980]  the genetics that it seems like he
[00:45.980 --> 00:47.880]  chooses the environments
[00:47.880 --> 00:48.880]  that he has.
[00:49.080 --> 00:50.960]  And I've been constantly impressed
[00:50.960 --> 00:52.280]  with with his work.
[00:52.920 --> 00:54.600]  I feel like when other people vouch
[00:54.600 --> 00:55.600]  for.
[00:55.600 --> 00:57.100]  So shout out to Joey Burger, the
[00:57.100 --> 00:58.540]  homeboat local.
[00:58.940 --> 01:00.060]  Check him out if you've never heard
[01:00.060 --> 01:01.060]  of him as well.
[01:01.460 --> 01:02.580]  But it's somebody that I feel like
[01:02.580 --> 01:04.080]  when he found out that we wanted to
[01:04.100 --> 01:06.100]  have Johnny on the on the show,
[01:06.100 --> 01:07.340]  you know, he kind of gave me a tip
[01:07.340 --> 01:08.300]  of the hat like, hey, that's
[01:08.300 --> 01:10.060]  somebody that I feel like a lot of
[01:10.060 --> 01:11.060]  people respect.
[01:11.540 --> 01:13.000]  So I'm excited to be able to talk to
[01:13.000 --> 01:14.680]  you, Johnny, today and kind of pick
[01:14.680 --> 01:15.920]  your brain, man. I was just saying
[01:15.920 --> 01:17.820]  before you came on live here that,
[01:18.140 --> 01:19.220]  you know, you're somebody that I
[01:19.220 --> 01:20.800]  felt like is your trains like a
[01:20.820 --> 01:22.220]  little bit slower for whatever
[01:22.220 --> 01:23.840]  reason. And you put these amazing
[01:23.860 --> 01:24.860]  photos out.
[01:25.100 --> 01:26.480]  Maybe not everybody sees it on
[01:26.480 --> 01:28.140]  Instagram for shadow ban or
[01:28.160 --> 01:29.680]  whatever the reason is, because it
[01:29.680 --> 01:31.400]  is hard as hell to build a cannabis
[01:31.400 --> 01:32.400]  Instagram.
[01:32.680 --> 01:34.560]  But the content that you're
[01:34.560 --> 01:35.780]  putting out, the genetics that
[01:35.780 --> 01:36.820]  you're choosing.
[01:37.360 --> 01:38.560]  I even want to kind of start the
[01:38.560 --> 01:39.980]  show with this man, because I feel
[01:39.980 --> 01:40.980]  like this is
[01:42.800 --> 01:44.200]  how do you get better than this?
[01:44.200 --> 01:45.480]  You're obviously growing outdoors.
[01:45.480 --> 01:46.740]  You have sunlight. There's praying
[01:46.740 --> 01:47.900]  leaves across the field.
[01:48.320 --> 01:49.680]  So this is kind of where I wanted
[01:49.680 --> 01:51.660]  to start today just because
[01:51.660 --> 01:53.360]  it's again, man,
[01:53.360 --> 01:55.680]  like there's no you
[01:55.680 --> 01:57.060]  could say a bunch of stuff out
[01:57.060 --> 01:58.200]  there. There's a lot of theories
[01:58.200 --> 01:59.120]  and that kind of stuff. And a lot
[01:59.120 --> 02:00.400]  of people have a lot of different
[02:00.400 --> 02:01.520]  ways to grow cannabis.
[02:01.520 --> 02:02.800]  But to me, man, when you have
[02:02.800 --> 02:04.740]  photos like this, you
[02:04.740 --> 02:05.700]  don't really need to tell me
[02:05.700 --> 02:07.200]  anything else other than now.
[02:07.200 --> 02:08.100]  I want to pick your brain.
[02:08.100 --> 02:10.080]  So shout out to Layton,
[02:10.080 --> 02:11.480]  shout out to Peter again for
[02:11.480 --> 02:12.920]  putting all of this stuff together
[02:12.920 --> 02:14.740]  with us, because I feel like
[02:14.740 --> 02:15.780]  this is going to be another one of
[02:15.780 --> 02:16.860]  those where a lot of people are
[02:16.880 --> 02:18.720]  going to see in real time
[02:19.240 --> 02:20.880]  from from your Instagram today
[02:21.520 --> 02:22.880]  what it can really take to
[02:23.400 --> 02:24.400]  to farm.
[02:24.440 --> 02:25.540]  It's such a level, man.
[02:25.540 --> 02:27.220]  I mean, this is to me, this is
[02:27.500 --> 02:28.500]  artwork.
[02:31.830 --> 02:33.230]  You're muted right there, buddy.
[02:35.270 --> 02:36.270]  And now you're unmuted.
[02:36.910 --> 02:37.910]  OK, cool.
[02:37.950 --> 02:39.610]  Hey, I really appreciate the
[02:39.610 --> 02:41.490]  platform, guys, and it's an honor
[02:41.490 --> 02:43.630]  to be here talking with you guys.
[02:44.870 --> 02:46.970]  And really, I'm just standing
[02:46.970 --> 02:48.330]  on the shoulder of giants.
[02:49.190 --> 02:50.830]  I've learned so much from
[02:50.830 --> 02:52.390]  from all of my mentors,
[02:53.310 --> 02:54.550]  you know, whether they know they're
[02:54.550 --> 02:56.330]  my mentors or not, I'm just a
[02:56.330 --> 02:58.110]  humble student of
[02:58.110 --> 02:59.790]  so many people who have been doing
[02:59.810 --> 03:01.890]  this for decades.
[03:01.930 --> 03:03.730]  So I just feel blessed to be
[03:03.730 --> 03:05.950]  able to be to be doing
[03:05.950 --> 03:07.970]  what I do, to be truly,
[03:08.170 --> 03:09.570]  you know, making a living, doing
[03:09.570 --> 03:11.490]  something that I'm passionate about.
[03:12.610 --> 03:14.010]  It's a blessing.
[03:14.010 --> 03:15.790]  You know, the old
[03:15.810 --> 03:17.650]  adage that it's you never
[03:17.650 --> 03:19.330]  work a day in your life if you love
[03:19.330 --> 03:20.330]  what you do.
[03:20.410 --> 03:21.610]  I don't know if I necessarily
[03:21.610 --> 03:22.790]  believe that there's a lot of hard
[03:22.790 --> 03:24.670]  work that goes into it, but I
[03:24.670 --> 03:25.710]  wouldn't be doing anything
[03:25.710 --> 03:27.530]  different if I had a billion
[03:27.530 --> 03:28.730]  dollars sitting in the bank.
[03:28.750 --> 03:30.710]  I'd be doing the same same exact
[03:30.710 --> 03:31.710]  thing. So, yeah,
[03:32.830 --> 03:34.350]  like I said, it's an honor to be
[03:34.350 --> 03:35.350]  here. You guys.
[03:36.670 --> 03:38.310]  And I feel like, you know, maybe
[03:38.310 --> 03:39.970]  you're just so into your craft that
[03:39.970 --> 03:41.570]  every now and then again, before you
[03:41.590 --> 03:42.750]  came on, and it's kind of like you
[03:42.750 --> 03:44.390]  give a small little glimpse into
[03:44.390 --> 03:45.630]  your world and as things have
[03:45.630 --> 03:47.530]  progressed and it's gone
[03:47.530 --> 03:49.590]  from like the photo we saw above
[03:49.590 --> 03:51.510]  to Peter, there's another one
[03:51.510 --> 03:52.890]  if you could pull up from August
[03:52.890 --> 03:54.890]  14th of this year.
[03:55.650 --> 03:57.630]  You kind of captions it field
[03:57.630 --> 03:59.650]  of dreams, and I like, you know,
[03:59.650 --> 04:01.470]  there's almost like a smirk when
[04:01.470 --> 04:02.970]  you put up the first photo and then
[04:02.970 --> 04:04.270]  the obviously the last photo is the
[04:04.270 --> 04:05.510]  one we use for today.
[04:06.170 --> 04:07.230]  But I feel like there's a there's
[04:07.230 --> 04:08.290]  something telling in that, man.
[04:08.290 --> 04:09.670]  It's almost like you can tell that
[04:10.970 --> 04:12.650]  just excited to be able to farm at
[04:12.650 --> 04:14.130]  this level and seeing your
[04:14.130 --> 04:15.570]  progression and seeing you work
[04:15.570 --> 04:16.810]  again with those genetics.
[04:17.690 --> 04:19.530]  Yeah. I mean, there's and then
[04:19.530 --> 04:20.770]  if we can kind of scroll to the
[04:20.770 --> 04:21.770]  right there.
[04:22.250 --> 04:23.250]  I'm.
[04:24.410 --> 04:25.410]  Yeah, I mean, this is
[04:27.090 --> 04:28.730]  this is what we all want to do, bro.
[04:28.810 --> 04:30.470]  You know, you're growing outdoors.
[04:30.490 --> 04:32.470]  You have an ability to do that and
[04:32.470 --> 04:33.610]  obviously doing it well.
[04:33.610 --> 04:35.590]  So we're excited to pick
[04:35.590 --> 04:36.330]  your brain, man.
[04:36.330 --> 04:38.130]  And I just feel like I'm
[04:38.130 --> 04:40.170]  like I'm also excited
[04:40.170 --> 04:41.650]  to be able to have you on the
[04:41.650 --> 04:42.950]  platform so that more people can
[04:42.970 --> 04:45.090]  kind of see in real time again
[04:46.010 --> 04:47.690]  what it takes to farm at this level
[04:47.690 --> 04:49.610]  and the overall health of
[04:49.610 --> 04:50.930]  the field itself.
[04:50.930 --> 04:52.210]  I feel like if you've ever seen
[04:52.210 --> 04:53.670]  hemp farming, maybe even done in
[04:53.670 --> 04:55.550]  conventional methods, it does
[04:55.570 --> 04:56.970]  not look like that whatsoever.
[04:57.570 --> 04:59.170]  So, yeah,
[04:59.170 --> 05:00.170]  man, let's kick it off.
[05:02.690 --> 05:04.730]  Yeah, where do you start, Brian?
[05:07.130 --> 05:08.850]  Well, I know you're you know, you're
[05:08.850 --> 05:09.850]  it seems like you're taking
[05:09.850 --> 05:11.530]  attributes from a variety of
[05:11.530 --> 05:13.110]  different things. So maybe you want
[05:13.110 --> 05:13.950]  to kind of give people your
[05:13.950 --> 05:15.410]  background on, you know, you're
[05:15.410 --> 05:16.650]  obviously sustainable.
[05:16.650 --> 05:18.470]  You're you're thinking next
[05:18.470 --> 05:20.010]  level with natural farming and that
[05:20.010 --> 05:21.790]  kind of thing. So let's kind of
[05:21.790 --> 05:23.050]  give your background on that kind of
[05:23.050 --> 05:24.210]  stuff and then we can get nitty
[05:24.210 --> 05:26.090]  gritty in the Q&A
[05:26.090 --> 05:26.990]  section because I have a lot of
[05:27.010 --> 05:28.050]  questions for you. And I definitely
[05:28.050 --> 05:29.370]  want to run over genetics with you
[05:29.370 --> 05:31.170]  because you see him again.
[05:31.170 --> 05:32.190]  There's a lot of guys out there
[05:32.190 --> 05:33.470]  that are running genetics, but it
[05:33.470 --> 05:35.370]  seems like you're one of those guys
[05:35.370 --> 05:36.670]  that's not only farming it, but
[05:36.670 --> 05:38.170]  just has an eye for certain
[05:38.170 --> 05:40.090]  genetics that really
[05:40.090 --> 05:41.170]  shows your talent, man.
[05:41.170 --> 05:42.450]  And I feel like some of the colors
[05:42.450 --> 05:43.610]  that are coming off and just some
[05:43.610 --> 05:45.130]  of the unique genetics that you're
[05:45.130 --> 05:47.150]  running. Also, shout out to Humboldt
[05:47.150 --> 05:49.390]  Company, because I feel like,
[05:49.390 --> 05:50.850]  you know, where you're getting your
[05:50.850 --> 05:52.610]  genetics also matters dramatically.
[05:52.610 --> 05:54.070]  So it's kind of like one person's
[05:54.070 --> 05:55.130]  artwork is then taken.
[05:55.130 --> 05:56.410]  Here's your canvas and then you get
[05:56.410 --> 05:57.930]  to run with it as well.
[05:57.930 --> 05:59.330]  So there's just a lot of things I
[05:59.330 --> 06:01.210]  want to chop it up with him late and
[06:01.210 --> 06:03.090]  on. But I think more people should
[06:03.090 --> 06:04.530]  kind of understand how you're
[06:04.530 --> 06:06.450]  farming and how you're able to get
[06:06.450 --> 06:08.350]  to that level, because
[06:08.350 --> 06:10.270]  again, man, it's it's extremely
[06:10.270 --> 06:11.270]  well done.
[06:12.050 --> 06:13.310]  Thank you.
[06:13.310 --> 06:15.130]  So originally, you know,
[06:15.130 --> 06:16.930]  I was kind of
[06:16.930 --> 06:17.970]  initially taught
[06:18.630 --> 06:20.670]  conventional, you know,
[06:20.670 --> 06:23.530]  if you will, synthetic fertilizers
[06:23.530 --> 06:25.830]  growing and potting soil.
[06:25.830 --> 06:27.890]  But it got to the point where
[06:27.890 --> 06:29.770]  I knew there was something
[06:29.770 --> 06:31.910]  more, there was something
[06:31.910 --> 06:34.470]  better and growing outdoors.
[06:34.470 --> 06:36.310]  I just knew like, yeah, there's all
[06:36.310 --> 06:37.650]  of these environmental tolls.
[06:37.650 --> 06:40.050]  It's horrible for the planet.
[06:40.050 --> 06:41.350]  And I just wanted to make that
[06:41.350 --> 06:42.750]  change.
[06:42.750 --> 06:44.510]  So initially, you know, it was a
[06:44.510 --> 06:46.910]  daunting task because I've been
[06:46.910 --> 06:48.290]  trained by these people who have
[06:48.290 --> 06:51.090]  been growing this particular way for
[06:51.090 --> 06:52.770]  decades, like I said.
[06:52.770 --> 06:54.650]  So, you know, I've
[06:54.650 --> 06:57.050]  been I started off doing research,
[06:57.050 --> 06:59.010]  reading all of Jeff Lowenfeld's
[06:59.010 --> 07:01.010]  books, the teaming with microbes
[07:01.010 --> 07:02.870]  and fungi and nutrients
[07:02.870 --> 07:03.650]  books.
[07:03.650 --> 07:05.410]  And that was great.
[07:05.410 --> 07:07.370]  And it really opened a lot of doors
[07:07.370 --> 07:10.050]  for me. But I didn't know,
[07:10.050 --> 07:11.490]  you know, how to apply that to
[07:11.490 --> 07:13.630]  cannabis in particular.
[07:13.630 --> 07:15.570]  And then I
[07:15.570 --> 07:17.550]  happened to post a question
[07:17.550 --> 07:19.390]  on my Facebook asking about
[07:19.390 --> 07:20.710]  living mulch.
[07:20.710 --> 07:22.470]  And I had a friend who was like,
[07:22.470 --> 07:24.150]  hey, there's this conference coming
[07:24.150 --> 07:25.950]  up in a month,
[07:25.950 --> 07:27.350]  regenerative, regenerative
[07:27.350 --> 07:29.710]  cannabis conference.
[07:29.710 --> 07:31.670]  So I saw that and instantly knew
[07:31.670 --> 07:32.910]  I'm like, all right, well, I have to
[07:32.910 --> 07:34.830]  attend this. This is really going to
[07:34.830 --> 07:36.270]  kind of put me in contact with
[07:36.270 --> 07:38.030]  people who are going to kind of
[07:38.030 --> 07:40.390]  like help out and also show me
[07:40.390 --> 07:43.070]  show me that it's possible.
[07:43.070 --> 07:44.390]  So I ended up going to the
[07:44.390 --> 07:45.770]  conference and late and you were
[07:45.770 --> 07:47.450]  actually the first person,
[07:47.450 --> 07:49.190]  I think, to speak at that conference
[07:49.190 --> 07:51.070]  in Humboldt. And,
[07:51.070 --> 07:52.870]  you know, you were talking about the
[07:52.870 --> 07:54.950]  horizontal soil system
[07:54.950 --> 07:56.190]  and all these things that were
[07:56.190 --> 07:58.250]  completely mind blowing to me.
[07:58.250 --> 08:00.330]  And, you know, from
[08:00.330 --> 08:02.330]  there, I just kind of knew that
[08:02.330 --> 08:04.130]  was the way that I had to I had
[08:04.130 --> 08:06.130]  to take things.
[08:06.130 --> 08:07.790]  I ended up parting ties with the
[08:07.790 --> 08:09.290]  project that I was working on
[08:10.490 --> 08:12.370]  at the time, the twenty thousand
[08:12.370 --> 08:14.910]  square foot salt grow.
[08:14.910 --> 08:16.870]  And, you know,
[08:16.870 --> 08:18.270]  just kind of transition and was
[08:18.270 --> 08:19.470]  looking for something,
[08:20.750 --> 08:22.390]  for something more aligned with my
[08:22.390 --> 08:24.350]  philosophy, because,
[08:24.350 --> 08:26.350]  you know, it everybody
[08:26.350 --> 08:28.170]  sells themselves for some amount
[08:28.170 --> 08:30.030]  of money if you're working.
[08:30.030 --> 08:32.390]  But I just didn't feel right doing
[08:32.390 --> 08:35.050]  it really went against my my ethos.
[08:35.050 --> 08:37.210]  And yeah, I just I wanted
[08:37.210 --> 08:39.190]  something else. So,
[08:39.190 --> 08:41.250]  you know, I ended up taking a job
[08:41.250 --> 08:43.290]  at a commercial nursery, which was
[08:43.290 --> 08:45.310]  a great, great time, great
[08:45.310 --> 08:46.290]  learning experience.
[08:46.290 --> 08:48.490]  I met a lot of really cool people.
[08:48.490 --> 08:50.550]  But still, it wasn't it wasn't
[08:50.550 --> 08:51.370]  what I wanted.
[08:51.370 --> 08:53.310]  You know, I missed what I missed
[08:53.310 --> 08:54.370]  working outside.
[08:55.530 --> 08:57.590]  I missed the seasonality of it.
[08:57.590 --> 08:59.550]  And yeah, being under the sun, out
[08:59.550 --> 09:02.990]  in nature with the fresh fresh air,
[09:02.990 --> 09:04.290]  seeing the plants express
[09:04.290 --> 09:06.190]  themselves naturally with
[09:06.190 --> 09:08.070]  that, you know,
[09:08.070 --> 09:10.290]  the kind of terroir, the environment
[09:10.290 --> 09:11.470]  of Humboldt County.
[09:12.910 --> 09:14.730]  So it was really,
[09:14.730 --> 09:16.590]  you know, I ended up leaving
[09:16.590 --> 09:18.830]  from there just because it didn't
[09:18.830 --> 09:21.190]  didn't kind of fit my
[09:21.190 --> 09:22.170]  my ethos.
[09:22.170 --> 09:24.350]  And I took a class with
[09:24.350 --> 09:26.710]  one of my mentors, Preston Smith.
[09:26.710 --> 09:28.950]  And Preston is an amazing farmer.
[09:28.950 --> 09:30.890]  He lives
[09:30.890 --> 09:32.890]  or lived up in Oregon at the time
[09:32.890 --> 09:35.210]  and managed acres and acres
[09:35.210 --> 09:37.050]  of hemp using
[09:37.050 --> 09:39.350]  Korean natural farming techniques.
[09:39.350 --> 09:41.210]  So I ended up going.
[09:41.210 --> 09:43.130]  Where are you currently at right
[09:43.130 --> 09:44.050]  now, Johnny?
[09:44.050 --> 09:45.450]  I'm in Humboldt County.
[09:45.450 --> 09:46.570]  All right. Yeah.
[09:46.570 --> 09:47.570]  Yeah.
[09:48.330 --> 09:50.250]  So he held a class
[09:50.250 --> 09:51.370]  and I attended that.
[09:51.370 --> 09:53.270]  And, you know, I'd already
[09:53.270 --> 09:55.070]  been kind of studying after the
[09:55.070 --> 09:56.530]  regenerative cannabis conference.
[09:56.530 --> 09:58.410]  Chris Trump was there and
[09:58.410 --> 10:00.370]  I had been kind of studying K&F,
[10:00.370 --> 10:02.290]  really taking it upon
[10:02.290 --> 10:04.530]  myself to learn the system,
[10:04.530 --> 10:06.210]  watching YouTube videos, reading
[10:06.210 --> 10:08.130]  literature,
[10:08.130 --> 10:09.510]  practicing, you know, making
[10:09.510 --> 10:11.190]  inputs, putting out collection
[10:11.190 --> 10:12.670]  boxes.
[10:12.670 --> 10:14.230]  But I wanted to go to a class, you
[10:14.230 --> 10:15.750]  know, and get those nuanced
[10:15.750 --> 10:17.190]  techniques. I feel like it's very
[10:17.190 --> 10:18.630]  important.
[10:18.630 --> 10:20.910]  And also Preston had that
[10:20.910 --> 10:22.790]  that knowledge of applying Korean
[10:22.790 --> 10:24.110]  natural farming to cannabis in
[10:24.110 --> 10:25.310]  particular.
[10:25.310 --> 10:27.270]  So I went to that class
[10:27.270 --> 10:29.130]  and, you know, I met
[10:29.130 --> 10:30.430]  a lot of awesome people.
[10:30.430 --> 10:32.250]  I reconnected with some people that
[10:32.250 --> 10:34.190]  I hadn't seen in a long time.
[10:34.190 --> 10:36.030]  And that kind of set me on my
[10:36.030 --> 10:38.070]  path. I started applying it to my
[10:38.070 --> 10:40.690]  personal indoor grow.
[10:40.690 --> 10:42.450]  These techniques
[10:42.450 --> 10:44.190]  and instantly, you know, saw
[10:44.190 --> 10:46.490]  amazing results.
[10:46.490 --> 10:48.810]  It was incredible, you know, for
[10:48.810 --> 10:50.710]  for as soon as I started applying
[10:50.710 --> 10:52.690]  IMO and as soon as I started
[10:52.690 --> 10:54.510]  going through,
[10:54.510 --> 10:55.570]  you know, the different type
[10:55.570 --> 10:57.910]  solutions, I saw a major
[10:57.910 --> 10:59.850]  bump in my plant health and
[10:59.850 --> 11:01.710]  my overall quality of the
[11:01.710 --> 11:03.730]  end product and yield,
[11:03.730 --> 11:04.910]  which is something that a lot of
[11:04.910 --> 11:06.610]  people kind of talk down
[11:06.610 --> 11:07.830]  upon. They're like, hey, if you
[11:07.830 --> 11:09.750]  switch over to this system,
[11:09.750 --> 11:12.270]  you're going to have decreased
[11:12.270 --> 11:14.050]  yield and it's going to be, you
[11:14.050 --> 11:15.910]  know, just kind of not worth it at
[11:15.910 --> 11:17.070]  the end of the day.
[11:17.070 --> 11:19.070]  And, you know, I found
[11:19.070 --> 11:21.010]  not that to be so far from
[11:21.010 --> 11:22.010]  the truth.
[11:22.810 --> 11:24.730]  You know, where one of my last
[11:24.730 --> 11:26.630]  indoor rounds, I pulled three pounds
[11:26.630 --> 11:28.810]  a light following all
[11:28.810 --> 11:30.350]  the Korean natural farming
[11:30.350 --> 11:32.030]  techniques,
[11:32.030 --> 11:34.270]  all the solutions and applying
[11:34.270 --> 11:35.270]  IMO
[11:36.250 --> 11:38.090]  to my to my indoor grow.
[11:38.090 --> 11:40.090]  So, yeah, it just really made
[11:40.090 --> 11:41.650]  me a believer in, you know, the
[11:41.650 --> 11:42.690]  proof is in the pudding.
[11:44.450 --> 11:46.610]  So, yeah, I mean, this this job
[11:46.610 --> 11:47.570]  kind of popped up.
[11:47.570 --> 11:48.710]  I was kind of in between
[11:48.710 --> 11:50.630]  opportunities and
[11:50.630 --> 11:52.530]  this job in Red Crest,
[11:52.530 --> 11:54.490]  which is right right nestled in
[11:54.490 --> 11:56.390]  the Redwood Forest
[11:56.390 --> 11:58.590]  of Humboldt County and
[11:58.590 --> 12:00.650]  this beautiful field right
[12:00.650 --> 12:01.970]  on the Eel River Valley
[12:03.210 --> 12:05.090]  with just amazing soil and this
[12:05.090 --> 12:06.910]  crazy history of
[12:06.910 --> 12:08.930]  of what it took to get that soil so
[12:08.930 --> 12:10.130]  rich and so
[12:11.410 --> 12:12.950]  just such great farmland.
[12:12.950 --> 12:14.890]  And it was all a series of
[12:14.890 --> 12:17.350]  miss misfortunate events.
[12:17.350 --> 12:19.010]  There was a great flood that
[12:19.010 --> 12:21.510]  happened in 1964,
[12:21.510 --> 12:23.890]  which completely decimated
[12:23.890 --> 12:26.170]  towns along the river.
[12:26.170 --> 12:27.530]  There was houses floating down the
[12:27.530 --> 12:28.390]  river.
[12:28.390 --> 12:30.110]  Lumber mills were just floating
[12:30.110 --> 12:31.970]  down all these logs.
[12:31.970 --> 12:34.010]  And what ended up happening is
[12:34.070 --> 12:36.310]  these logs kind of deposited
[12:36.310 --> 12:38.510]  on on the river basin
[12:38.510 --> 12:40.390]  and also with deposited with that
[12:40.390 --> 12:42.550]  was about 20 feet of silty
[12:42.550 --> 12:44.430]  loam, amazing
[12:44.430 --> 12:45.290]  soil.
[12:45.290 --> 12:47.390]  So it like made like a
[12:47.390 --> 12:49.870]  massive Google culture
[12:49.870 --> 12:51.890]  with this amazing, amazing
[12:51.890 --> 12:53.690]  textured soil, which I don't think
[12:53.690 --> 12:55.510]  really it can get much better as
[12:55.510 --> 12:56.630]  far as native soil.
[12:57.950 --> 12:59.590]  So it was a real treat to be able
[12:59.590 --> 13:00.790]  to kind of work,
[13:01.910 --> 13:03.830]  work this field and kind of
[13:03.830 --> 13:05.750]  learn some new
[13:05.750 --> 13:06.750]  techniques.
[13:08.410 --> 13:10.530]  Dry farming is something that
[13:10.530 --> 13:12.570]  it's pretty unique to that area,
[13:12.570 --> 13:14.970]  and it's because of its proximity
[13:14.970 --> 13:16.870]  to the river
[13:16.870 --> 13:18.730]  and because of those
[13:18.730 --> 13:20.730]  those floods that happened and all
[13:20.730 --> 13:23.050]  that silty loam that got deposited,
[13:23.050 --> 13:24.810]  it's 20 feet of it.
[13:24.810 --> 13:26.690]  So it basically creates this
[13:26.690 --> 13:28.530]  wicking effect where the moisture
[13:28.530 --> 13:29.990]  is down there.
[13:29.990 --> 13:31.850]  And during the summer, it wicks
[13:31.850 --> 13:33.010]  up to the surface.
[13:33.930 --> 13:34.890]  Which is incredible.
[13:34.890 --> 13:36.810]  You know, I I watered those
[13:36.810 --> 13:38.650]  plants for the first
[13:38.650 --> 13:40.210]  first like three weeks of their life
[13:40.210 --> 13:42.130]  as they were getting established.
[13:42.130 --> 13:44.210]  And then I cut the water off
[13:44.210 --> 13:45.590]  and they didn't receive any water
[13:45.590 --> 13:47.650]  after that until it rained,
[13:47.650 --> 13:49.310]  which was about,
[13:49.310 --> 13:51.290]  I think, like the
[13:51.290 --> 13:52.790]  second week of September, we got a
[13:52.790 --> 13:53.570]  little bit of rain.
[13:53.570 --> 13:54.950]  So that's all the irrigation they
[13:54.950 --> 13:56.390]  got in their flowering period.
[13:56.390 --> 13:58.250]  And, you know, it was kind of a leap
[13:58.250 --> 14:00.370]  of faith. I I had never
[14:00.370 --> 14:02.650]  actually grown in native soil.
[14:02.670 --> 14:04.930]  I had never dry farmed,
[14:04.930 --> 14:06.950]  but I had kind of watched people
[14:06.950 --> 14:08.350]  who were doing that, you know,
[14:08.350 --> 14:09.750]  watch people who were planting in
[14:09.750 --> 14:12.490]  that region for for a long time.
[14:12.490 --> 14:14.350]  And these people, yeah, they're
[14:14.350 --> 14:15.990]  hardcore. They don't some of them
[14:15.990 --> 14:17.050]  don't even water upon
[14:17.050 --> 14:18.310]  transplanting.
[14:18.310 --> 14:19.990]  They put the plants in the ground.
[14:19.990 --> 14:21.570]  They let them struggle for a couple
[14:21.590 --> 14:22.390]  weeks.
[14:22.390 --> 14:24.430]  Then they tap in and
[14:24.430 --> 14:25.990]  it's off to the races after that.
[14:28.210 --> 14:29.810]  So, yeah, it was amazing to see that
[14:29.830 --> 14:31.550]  process and get get a chance to be
[14:31.570 --> 14:33.210]  able to put that into play.
[14:34.130 --> 14:35.850]  I never want to farm in a different
[14:35.850 --> 14:37.010]  way, to be honest with you.
[14:38.810 --> 14:41.290]  So how big of a acreage were you
[14:41.290 --> 14:42.470]  working on?
[14:42.470 --> 14:43.470]  It was one acre.
[14:44.930 --> 14:47.010]  The air, the canopy was one acre
[14:47.010 --> 14:48.890]  in the fenced in area was about two
[14:48.890 --> 14:49.890]  that we had.
[14:51.230 --> 14:52.490]  So you're literally.
[14:52.490 --> 14:53.990]  Oh, my God. Was it a picture of the
[14:53.990 --> 14:54.990]  light depths?
[14:55.890 --> 14:57.430]  Yes. So that.
[14:57.450 --> 14:59.490]  Yep. That was from
[15:00.350 --> 15:02.570]  a spot that I worked
[15:02.570 --> 15:03.570]  at
[15:04.950 --> 15:07.590]  about four years ago.
[15:07.590 --> 15:09.490]  That was that kind of synthetic grow
[15:09.490 --> 15:10.650]  where I was starting to make that
[15:10.650 --> 15:12.750]  transition, where I was like doing
[15:12.750 --> 15:14.510]  it. But I knew there was something
[15:14.510 --> 15:16.730]  else and wanted to really step
[15:16.730 --> 15:18.150]  up my craft because it got to the
[15:18.150 --> 15:20.050]  point where things were so dialed
[15:20.050 --> 15:22.190]  and so kind of like easy
[15:22.190 --> 15:24.810]  for me where it was like, OK, like
[15:24.810 --> 15:26.390]  where is the craft in this?
[15:26.390 --> 15:27.350]  Where's the challenge?
[15:27.350 --> 15:29.030]  I'm like, I feel like any anybody
[15:29.510 --> 15:32.350]  who can read a little
[15:32.350 --> 15:34.410]  instruction can do this.
[15:34.410 --> 15:36.510]  And, you know, I really
[15:36.510 --> 15:38.470]  I wanted I like a good challenge
[15:38.470 --> 15:40.410]  and I really I take
[15:40.410 --> 15:41.850]  a lot of pride in my work and I
[15:41.850 --> 15:44.370]  love, you know, I love
[15:44.370 --> 15:46.630]  cannabis. I think that organic
[15:46.630 --> 15:48.710]  cultivation is superior for so
[15:48.710 --> 15:49.710]  many reasons.
[15:50.950 --> 15:52.930]  So, yeah, I really stepped away
[15:52.930 --> 15:54.730]  from wanting to do that
[15:54.730 --> 15:56.570]  and I wanted to progress
[15:56.570 --> 15:58.590]  and kind of elevate my skill
[15:58.610 --> 15:59.610]  set.
[16:00.570 --> 16:02.150]  Well, you certainly found a really
[16:02.150 --> 16:03.450]  nice spot to do that.
[16:05.430 --> 16:07.230]  Yeah, I hit the jackpot.
[16:07.230 --> 16:08.370]  Yeah, literally.
[16:08.370 --> 16:10.230]  Like, you know, nature
[16:10.230 --> 16:11.790]  really blessed that space.
[16:11.790 --> 16:13.410]  And I'm familiar with that flood.
[16:13.410 --> 16:14.910]  It must have been pretty horrific
[16:14.910 --> 16:17.450]  for the people on the river, but
[16:17.450 --> 16:20.530]  it certainly did build some unique
[16:20.530 --> 16:22.430]  dry farming spots along
[16:22.430 --> 16:24.010]  the eel and you got one.
[16:24.010 --> 16:25.890]  So that's great. And the fact that
[16:25.890 --> 16:27.950]  your your plants are actually
[16:27.950 --> 16:29.710]  tapped into a living
[16:29.710 --> 16:31.610]  AMO system, a living AMO
[16:31.610 --> 16:33.550]  machine, the eel
[16:33.550 --> 16:35.550]  river is just, you know, I can't
[16:35.550 --> 16:37.090]  even imagine what the
[16:38.810 --> 16:40.730]  the end result was for that for
[16:40.730 --> 16:42.270]  that crop. Is that something that
[16:42.270 --> 16:44.210]  you that you pulled down this year
[16:44.210 --> 16:45.750]  or was that last year?
[16:45.750 --> 16:47.130]  Yep, that was this year.
[16:47.130 --> 16:49.410]  And honestly,
[16:49.410 --> 16:51.070]  you know, I take a lot of pride in
[16:51.070 --> 16:52.870]  my indoor as well, but I'm more
[16:52.870 --> 16:54.910]  excited to be smoking the sun
[16:54.910 --> 16:56.350]  grown dry farm.
[16:56.350 --> 16:58.130]  I reach for that 10 times out of
[16:58.130 --> 17:00.170]  10. I have to like force
[17:00.170 --> 17:02.350]  myself to smoke my indoor, which is
[17:02.350 --> 17:04.050]  it's pretty darn good.
[17:04.050 --> 17:05.610]  But I'm like, no, I want the it's
[17:05.610 --> 17:07.930]  just so that the terpenes
[17:07.930 --> 17:09.970]  that came out, the the look,
[17:09.970 --> 17:11.710]  it's just, you know, I'm sure you
[17:11.710 --> 17:13.710]  guys are familiar with the concept
[17:13.710 --> 17:15.830]  that that drought stress
[17:15.830 --> 17:17.690]  will kind of increase
[17:17.690 --> 17:19.050]  secondary metabolites.
[17:19.050 --> 17:20.310]  So your terpenes and your
[17:20.310 --> 17:21.310]  cannabinoids
[17:22.490 --> 17:24.330]  and dry farming is
[17:24.330 --> 17:26.270]  just a perfect example
[17:26.270 --> 17:27.870]  of that. It's wow.
[17:27.870 --> 17:29.470]  You know, some of these some of
[17:29.470 --> 17:31.850]  these bugs, they're just so frosty,
[17:31.850 --> 17:34.230]  it's so amazingly
[17:35.630 --> 17:37.950]  this terpene rich where
[17:37.950 --> 17:39.550]  it's incredible.
[17:39.550 --> 17:41.350]  So, yeah, it's I really
[17:41.350 --> 17:43.210]  am super stoked to
[17:43.230 --> 17:44.370]  have landed that spot.
[17:44.370 --> 17:45.750]  And like I said, I don't want to
[17:45.750 --> 17:46.790]  smoke other weed.
[17:46.790 --> 17:48.670]  I don't want to grow cannabis
[17:48.670 --> 17:50.870]  in other spots. Now I got really
[17:50.870 --> 17:52.070]  spoiled with this spot.
[17:52.070 --> 17:53.910]  So, yeah, it's it was an honor
[17:53.910 --> 17:55.650]  to kind of work in that
[17:55.650 --> 17:57.610]  in the in the native soil there.
[17:57.610 --> 17:58.610]  And
[17:59.730 --> 18:01.230]  you know, I just
[18:01.230 --> 18:03.410]  you definitely you definitely
[18:03.410 --> 18:04.410]  hit gold, brother.
[18:05.010 --> 18:05.770]  Yeah.
[18:05.770 --> 18:07.370]  Yeah. And it's just the drive to I
[18:07.370 --> 18:09.270]  mean, my my commute on the
[18:09.270 --> 18:11.210]  daily is I I get about
[18:11.210 --> 18:12.750]  10 minutes of driving through the
[18:12.750 --> 18:14.630]  redwoods on the Avenue
[18:14.630 --> 18:16.530]  of the Giants, which is like
[18:16.530 --> 18:19.290]  how amazing is that just to reset
[18:19.290 --> 18:20.890]  and really like just get in the
[18:20.890 --> 18:21.750]  zone.
[18:21.750 --> 18:23.430]  And yeah, then I'm out there and
[18:23.450 --> 18:24.750]  just, you know, redwoods in the
[18:24.750 --> 18:26.370]  distance, you know, I'm surrounded
[18:26.370 --> 18:27.930]  by mountains.
[18:27.930 --> 18:29.630]  It was also a unique experience
[18:29.630 --> 18:31.450]  because the field that
[18:31.450 --> 18:33.390]  I'm cultivating is
[18:33.390 --> 18:34.810]  also being shared by
[18:36.050 --> 18:38.130]  by this Mennonite farmer
[18:38.130 --> 18:40.350]  who's cultivating corn
[18:40.350 --> 18:42.330]  and he's doing a winter
[18:42.330 --> 18:44.070]  crop as well, which I'm not sure
[18:44.070 --> 18:45.690]  where he's growing. But so I'm in
[18:45.690 --> 18:47.670]  this big, you know, surrounded
[18:47.670 --> 18:49.570]  by corn and
[18:49.570 --> 18:50.970]  like you could kind of see it in
[18:50.970 --> 18:52.690]  the background there where
[18:52.690 --> 18:54.130]  yeah, I'm in this little island of
[18:54.130 --> 18:56.210]  cannabis surrounded by
[18:56.210 --> 18:57.210]  corn.
[18:57.850 --> 18:59.650]  This super neat location to
[18:59.650 --> 19:00.650]  be farming.
[19:03.410 --> 19:05.790]  So what cultivars did you end up
[19:05.790 --> 19:06.790]  plugging in this year?
[19:07.930 --> 19:09.970]  So it was all Humboldt
[19:09.970 --> 19:10.970]  Seed Company.
[19:12.290 --> 19:13.770]  I hadn't really had too much
[19:13.770 --> 19:15.550]  experience with their
[19:15.550 --> 19:17.330]  their genetics other than
[19:17.330 --> 19:18.710]  just kind of seeing what they had.
[19:18.710 --> 19:20.330]  I'd consumed some and it was
[19:20.330 --> 19:22.430]  extremely their blueberry muffin
[19:22.430 --> 19:24.470]  was just, you know, it has
[19:24.470 --> 19:26.630]  that that old school blueberry
[19:26.630 --> 19:28.570]  flavor, which is one of my favorites.
[19:28.570 --> 19:30.710]  And, you know, I was just super
[19:30.710 --> 19:32.710]  impressed. And,
[19:32.710 --> 19:34.070]  you know, it really helps when
[19:34.070 --> 19:35.230]  you're dry farming.
[19:35.230 --> 19:37.030]  It's not essential, but it
[19:37.030 --> 19:39.830]  helps a lot if you have a taproot.
[19:39.830 --> 19:41.750]  So clones really, you
[19:41.750 --> 19:43.770]  could do it, but there's definitely
[19:43.770 --> 19:45.190]  been a lot of people who are like,
[19:45.190 --> 19:47.090]  yeah, they they'll perform,
[19:47.090 --> 19:48.850]  but it's just not the same.
[19:48.850 --> 19:50.790]  So, you know, we ended
[19:50.790 --> 19:52.690]  up getting about six
[19:52.690 --> 19:55.110]  thousand feminized
[19:55.110 --> 19:57.230]  seeds just because,
[19:57.230 --> 19:58.730]  you know, the feminized aspect,
[19:58.730 --> 19:59.890]  because when you're running that
[19:59.890 --> 20:02.190]  many that many
[20:02.190 --> 20:04.110]  plants, taking up the real estate
[20:04.110 --> 20:05.830]  of having males, having all
[20:05.830 --> 20:08.090]  the males, having to make sure,
[20:08.090 --> 20:10.170]  you know, it continuously monitor
[20:10.170 --> 20:11.910]  to make sure that there's no like,
[20:13.630 --> 20:15.510]  you know, nothing got missed.
[20:15.510 --> 20:16.790]  You know, it'd be devastating.
[20:16.790 --> 20:18.610]  One single male just, you know,
[20:18.610 --> 20:20.710]  completely seed up that whole
[20:20.710 --> 20:22.510]  field and all the neighbors crops
[20:22.510 --> 20:23.410]  pot potentially.
[20:23.410 --> 20:26.710]  So, yeah, we ran all feminized
[20:26.710 --> 20:28.390]  Humboldt seed company genetics and
[20:28.390 --> 20:29.390]  we ran
[20:30.630 --> 20:32.950]  their strain Jelly Rancher,
[20:34.830 --> 20:37.070]  Lemongrass.
[20:37.070 --> 20:39.330]  There was an Emerald Fire OG
[20:39.330 --> 20:41.230]  and Raspberry Parfait
[20:41.230 --> 20:42.230]  that we ended up running.
[20:43.350 --> 20:44.950]  And I was really impressed, you
[20:44.950 --> 20:47.570]  know, the Jelly Rancher,
[20:47.570 --> 20:49.590]  it's super turpy.
[20:49.590 --> 20:51.150]  It washed really well
[20:52.110 --> 20:54.190]  and it's just an excellent,
[20:54.190 --> 20:56.390]  excellent smoke, something unique
[20:56.390 --> 20:58.430]  that the turping profiles
[20:58.430 --> 21:01.270]  I feel like nowadays are rather
[21:01.270 --> 21:02.910]  limited.
[21:02.910 --> 21:04.750]  Lots of gelato crosses,
[21:06.030 --> 21:07.770]  lots of purple punch crosses.
[21:07.770 --> 21:08.670]  And I feel like that's kind of
[21:08.670 --> 21:10.590]  dominating the landscape.
[21:10.590 --> 21:12.810]  So this this Jelly Rancher
[21:12.810 --> 21:14.590]  was something, you know,
[21:14.590 --> 21:16.630]  that was very unique, kind
[21:16.630 --> 21:19.290]  of like a light, like
[21:19.290 --> 21:21.330]  cherry candy kind of turping
[21:21.330 --> 21:22.210]  profile.
[21:22.210 --> 21:24.090]  And Peter, he has a photo of
[21:24.090 --> 21:26.410]  that real recently
[21:26.410 --> 21:28.410]  of some hash rosen with that
[21:28.410 --> 21:29.850]  Jelly Rancher.
[21:29.850 --> 21:31.370]  Hey, Johnny, so do they get the
[21:31.370 --> 21:32.730]  punch back in the purple?
[21:36.450 --> 21:37.250]  That's great.
[21:37.250 --> 21:39.050]  That's you know, I
[21:39.050 --> 21:40.870]  even don't understand how that just
[21:40.890 --> 21:42.950]  got so watered down to the grand
[21:42.950 --> 21:43.950]  daddy purple
[21:44.970 --> 21:46.930]  backbone to that and the
[21:46.930 --> 21:47.690]  Larry OG.
[21:47.690 --> 21:49.530]  It just got so, you know, how's
[21:49.530 --> 21:50.970]  the bag appeal?
[21:50.970 --> 21:53.370]  But it's just it's completely
[21:53.370 --> 21:55.330]  lacking as far as, yeah, the
[21:55.330 --> 21:57.130]  the turpines just are like flat.
[21:57.130 --> 21:59.090]  It doesn't doesn't really get you
[21:59.090 --> 22:00.770]  where you want to get necessarily.
[22:02.690 --> 22:04.970]  So, yeah, I mean, it's just
[22:04.970 --> 22:06.890]  it was nice to run some unique
[22:06.890 --> 22:07.890]  genetics, too.
[22:07.890 --> 22:09.130]  And I didn't know what to expect,
[22:09.130 --> 22:10.670]  really. You know, the Jelly Rancher
[22:10.670 --> 22:12.250]  was relatively, I think, new.
[22:12.250 --> 22:13.770]  That was released this year.
[22:13.770 --> 22:15.610]  Same with the raspberry parfait.
[22:16.410 --> 22:17.410]  In the yeah, I hadn't
[22:17.410 --> 22:19.850]  run any of these things and
[22:19.850 --> 22:21.610]  I was thoroughly impressed and I'm
[22:21.610 --> 22:23.490]  definitely I want to run the
[22:23.490 --> 22:25.210]  Jelly Rancher again next year and
[22:25.210 --> 22:27.130]  the raspberry parfait as well.
[22:29.050 --> 22:30.330]  Phenomenal.
[22:30.330 --> 22:31.770]  The raspberry parfait has really
[22:31.770 --> 22:34.290]  like it has that turpineline
[22:34.290 --> 22:36.410]  kind of dominant profile, which
[22:36.410 --> 22:38.730]  is like similar to like Jack Herrera
[22:38.730 --> 22:41.010]  or Durban Poison
[22:41.010 --> 22:43.410]  or train wreck. And man, oh man,
[22:43.410 --> 22:45.210]  I I'm a sucker for that.
[22:45.330 --> 22:47.330]  I'm a sucker for that stuff.
[22:47.330 --> 22:48.690]  It really just agrees with my
[22:48.690 --> 22:49.690]  physiology.
[22:50.890 --> 22:52.490]  Yeah. What were your yields like
[22:52.490 --> 22:53.490]  this year?
[22:54.170 --> 22:55.610]  I'm pretty good.
[22:55.610 --> 22:57.570]  You know, we ended up doing
[22:57.570 --> 22:59.530]  a lot of fresh frozen and we still
[22:59.530 --> 23:01.570]  have a lot of stuff
[23:01.570 --> 23:04.130]  that's been up because
[23:04.130 --> 23:05.650]  just the market is the way it is.
[23:05.650 --> 23:07.450]  And we're kind of figuring
[23:07.450 --> 23:09.210]  out how we want to proceed.
[23:09.210 --> 23:11.370]  It's unfortunate, but,
[23:11.370 --> 23:12.410]  you know, I think we're going to
[23:12.410 --> 23:14.370]  have to run the buds through it
[23:14.370 --> 23:15.850]  through a trim machine if we want
[23:15.850 --> 23:17.850]  to be able to kind
[23:17.850 --> 23:19.890]  of just turn a profit
[23:19.890 --> 23:22.090]  because of how how bottomed
[23:22.090 --> 23:23.250]  out the market is.
[23:23.250 --> 23:25.130]  But overall, you know,
[23:25.130 --> 23:26.490]  I think we did pretty well.
[23:26.490 --> 23:28.610]  I mean, we pulled, say,
[23:28.610 --> 23:30.650]  like 800 to 1000 pounds
[23:30.650 --> 23:32.450]  out of there, give
[23:32.450 --> 23:33.650]  or take. You know, it's hard to
[23:33.650 --> 23:36.170]  tell right now just because of
[23:36.170 --> 23:37.970]  things aren't processed yet.
[23:37.970 --> 23:39.970]  But, you know,
[23:39.970 --> 23:41.850]  as far as the I was kind
[23:41.850 --> 23:43.370]  of skeptical on the yields with the
[23:43.370 --> 23:45.290]  dry farming and how the buds were
[23:45.290 --> 23:46.210]  going to form.
[23:46.210 --> 23:48.130]  But there are some really dense
[23:48.130 --> 23:49.130]  filled out
[23:50.050 --> 23:51.290]  buds in the plants.
[23:51.290 --> 23:52.290]  You know, they weren't.
[23:53.690 --> 23:55.650]  They didn't seem like they struggled
[23:55.650 --> 23:57.090]  at all. You know, it seemed like
[23:57.090 --> 23:59.250]  business as usual
[23:59.250 --> 24:01.090]  as far as just how they
[24:01.090 --> 24:02.090]  they grew.
[24:03.090 --> 24:04.650]  I will admit, though, at first,
[24:06.050 --> 24:08.290]  you know, being in native soil,
[24:08.290 --> 24:10.130]  the plants definitely are a little
[24:10.130 --> 24:12.050]  slower to take
[24:12.050 --> 24:13.810]  off than than growing in like a
[24:13.810 --> 24:15.650]  potting soil or growing in
[24:15.650 --> 24:17.690]  some kind of, you know,
[24:17.690 --> 24:19.850]  other soil is medium
[24:19.850 --> 24:21.450]  where it took longer for them to get
[24:21.450 --> 24:22.810]  established and take off.
[24:22.810 --> 24:24.050]  But at the end of the day, they
[24:24.050 --> 24:26.090]  really, you know, they took
[24:26.090 --> 24:27.410]  off and there were some plants that
[24:27.410 --> 24:29.370]  were, you know, seven feet
[24:29.370 --> 24:30.610]  tall.
[24:30.610 --> 24:32.690]  Some of the the are the raspberry
[24:32.690 --> 24:34.450]  parfait ended up getting,
[24:34.450 --> 24:35.650]  you know, pretty massive.
[24:36.850 --> 24:38.850]  Yeah, that's that's typical
[24:38.850 --> 24:40.770]  in it, like a heavy
[24:40.770 --> 24:42.050]  soil where you didn't have a lot of
[24:42.050 --> 24:42.930]  fluff in it.
[24:42.930 --> 24:44.250]  They just can't push those roots
[24:44.250 --> 24:45.690]  fast enough. But once they get
[24:45.690 --> 24:47.170]  going, it's like a fucking freight
[24:47.170 --> 24:48.170]  train.
[24:48.170 --> 24:49.610]  You can't stop that shit.
[24:49.610 --> 24:50.490]  Oh, yeah.
[24:50.490 --> 24:52.130]  And they were so strong, too.
[24:52.130 --> 24:53.770]  I mean, these plants, I've never
[24:53.770 --> 24:55.610]  seen such hardy,
[24:55.610 --> 24:56.490]  strong plants.
[24:56.490 --> 24:57.770]  They get windy there.
[24:57.770 --> 24:58.810]  It gets really windy.
[24:58.810 --> 25:01.010]  There's a video on on my Instagram
[25:01.010 --> 25:02.650]  of these things just getting thrown
[25:02.650 --> 25:05.050]  around like headbanging.
[25:05.050 --> 25:07.050]  And, you know,
[25:07.050 --> 25:09.410]  we we use trellis,
[25:09.410 --> 25:11.410]  but a lot of people in the area
[25:11.410 --> 25:13.610]  doing dry farming, they don't even
[25:13.610 --> 25:16.090]  try to like support the plants.
[25:16.090 --> 25:18.170]  They just go, you know, trellis
[25:18.170 --> 25:19.970]  lists and they don't
[25:19.970 --> 25:21.730]  have any any
[25:21.730 --> 25:23.610]  issues from what I gather.
[25:23.610 --> 25:24.610]  It's a little
[25:26.130 --> 25:27.970]  nerve wracking and like stressful
[25:27.970 --> 25:29.370]  for me that, you know, because if
[25:29.370 --> 25:31.330]  there's a freak, even crazier
[25:31.330 --> 25:33.090]  windstorm or an early rain or
[25:33.090 --> 25:35.090]  something, you know,
[25:35.090 --> 25:36.890]  I it's it could be,
[25:36.890 --> 25:39.210]  you know, pretty problematic
[25:39.730 --> 25:42.170]  as far as, you know, product loss.
[25:42.170 --> 25:43.770]  But, you know, next year I want to
[25:43.770 --> 25:44.490]  give it a shot.
[25:44.490 --> 25:46.370]  I want to give, you know, at least
[25:46.370 --> 25:48.170]  like a section of plants, just
[25:48.170 --> 25:50.010]  no trellis and see how
[25:50.010 --> 25:51.690]  they hold up. But they were strong,
[25:51.690 --> 25:53.410]  you know, something about being in
[25:53.410 --> 25:55.330]  that native soil anchored in there.
[25:57.370 --> 25:58.410]  You know, I feel like there's a lot
[25:58.410 --> 26:00.610]  of silica probably in the soil
[26:00.610 --> 26:02.570]  and they just really they're sturdy,
[26:02.570 --> 26:05.250]  strong, robust plants.
[26:05.250 --> 26:07.410]  Did you use the stake and wire
[26:07.410 --> 26:09.170]  trellis or did you use netting
[26:09.210 --> 26:10.410]  trellis?
[26:10.410 --> 26:11.890]  We use netting.
[26:11.890 --> 26:13.090]  We use netting, which I hate the
[26:13.090 --> 26:14.570]  stuff. I hate working with it.
[26:15.570 --> 26:16.970]  You know, next year I really want to
[26:16.970 --> 26:19.130]  push the jute trellis
[26:19.130 --> 26:20.930]  netting, which is made out of like a
[26:20.930 --> 26:21.930]  hemp fiber.
[26:23.370 --> 26:24.530]  Just because, you know, I hate
[26:24.530 --> 26:26.370]  working with plastic and like I
[26:26.370 --> 26:28.930]  really like I comb through the field
[26:28.930 --> 26:30.930]  several times trying to get every
[26:30.930 --> 26:32.770]  little zip tie piece of
[26:32.770 --> 26:33.770]  trellis up.
[26:35.170 --> 26:36.770]  And I just feel like it's it's
[26:37.770 --> 26:39.530]  it's one of those things that if I
[26:39.530 --> 26:41.490]  can get away with not using it
[26:41.490 --> 26:42.450]  or using something that's
[26:42.450 --> 26:44.490]  sustainable, you know,
[26:44.490 --> 26:46.570]  I definitely would rather
[26:46.570 --> 26:48.650]  pay the extra money to get that that
[26:48.650 --> 26:50.490]  jute trellis as opposed
[26:50.490 --> 26:51.490]  to, yeah, using
[26:52.530 --> 26:54.290]  you know, using a plastic trellis
[26:54.290 --> 26:55.290]  netting.
[26:55.290 --> 26:56.570]  So here's a here's a little gold
[26:56.570 --> 26:57.570]  nugget for you.
[26:58.610 --> 27:00.650]  Kevin Jodry farms on top
[27:00.650 --> 27:02.490]  of a mountain out there
[27:02.490 --> 27:04.650]  and the wind is just nuts.
[27:04.650 --> 27:06.650]  You can kick up to 80 miles
[27:06.650 --> 27:07.970]  an hour in a heartbeat.
[27:07.970 --> 27:09.690]  What he does is he uses metal
[27:09.690 --> 27:12.170]  fencing stakes, pounds them in
[27:12.170 --> 27:14.130]  and then uses a single wire
[27:14.130 --> 27:15.850]  along throughout, you know, down
[27:15.850 --> 27:17.370]  the row. And then he takes little
[27:17.370 --> 27:19.250]  clips and he clips the
[27:19.250 --> 27:20.970]  stock to the wire.
[27:20.970 --> 27:22.370]  So at the end of the session, at the
[27:22.370 --> 27:23.930]  end of the grow, you just unclip the
[27:23.930 --> 27:26.530]  plants, pull them out,
[27:26.530 --> 27:27.850]  put them in the truck, weigh them, do
[27:27.850 --> 27:29.970]  your thing. But the trellis is not
[27:29.970 --> 27:31.330]  something you have to deal with.
[27:31.330 --> 27:32.730]  You just go back into that same
[27:32.730 --> 27:34.010]  location next year.
[27:34.010 --> 27:35.570]  So it might be a really good way for
[27:35.610 --> 27:37.850]  you to protect yourself against
[27:37.850 --> 27:40.010]  those end of season rains
[27:40.010 --> 27:41.730]  and those crazy winds that pick up
[27:41.730 --> 27:43.650]  along that river without getting too
[27:43.650 --> 27:45.490]  crazy with the plastic
[27:45.490 --> 27:46.730]  and the jute I love.
[27:46.730 --> 27:48.090]  But the problem with the jute is that
[27:48.090 --> 27:50.050]  it rots. So you're going to have to
[27:50.050 --> 27:50.810]  compost it.
[27:50.810 --> 27:52.970]  And there are a lot of jute products
[27:52.970 --> 27:55.370]  that have preservatives
[27:55.370 --> 27:56.610]  put into them, too, that are
[27:57.930 --> 28:00.250]  biocidal, you know, and compost.
[28:00.250 --> 28:02.250]  So anyway, that's just my little
[28:02.250 --> 28:03.170]  gold nugget for now.
[28:03.170 --> 28:04.890]  But let's keep going on these on
[28:04.930 --> 28:06.570]  these genetics. Did all of them wash
[28:06.570 --> 28:08.330]  or did you just have specific ones to
[28:08.330 --> 28:09.450]  wash?
[28:09.450 --> 28:11.490]  So we didn't
[28:11.490 --> 28:13.370]  end up even doing a test with
[28:13.370 --> 28:15.810]  the raspberry parfait.
[28:15.810 --> 28:18.090]  The lemongrass really didn't wash
[28:18.090 --> 28:19.810]  too well.
[28:19.810 --> 28:22.130]  The OG, surprisingly, we tested
[28:22.130 --> 28:24.170]  it with a little jar test and it
[28:24.170 --> 28:25.650]  washed pretty well.
[28:25.650 --> 28:27.810]  But just from
[28:27.810 --> 28:29.730]  my buddy who is running all of
[28:29.730 --> 28:31.730]  running the material, he is like,
[28:31.730 --> 28:33.490]  yeah, even though this like have a
[28:33.610 --> 28:35.530]  good jar test, he's like, oh, gee,
[28:35.530 --> 28:37.010]  like he's like, it's really
[28:38.090 --> 28:39.970]  it's not something that
[28:39.970 --> 28:41.890]  people really will wash and make
[28:41.890 --> 28:43.810]  into solventless or like ice water
[28:43.810 --> 28:44.810]  hash.
[28:45.530 --> 28:46.890]  So we didn't end up washing that.
[28:46.890 --> 28:48.890]  The Jolly Rancher dumped.
[28:48.890 --> 28:50.610]  It was really impressive.
[28:52.210 --> 28:53.930]  Whereas, yeah, we just kind of we
[28:53.930 --> 28:55.450]  would have tested the lemongrass to
[28:55.450 --> 28:57.050]  see, but I'm guessing that probably
[28:57.050 --> 28:58.890]  wouldn't wash, too, because from my
[28:58.890 --> 29:01.330]  understanding that those kind of
[29:01.330 --> 29:03.450]  that kind of profile, it
[29:03.610 --> 29:05.370]  tends to like all the it's
[29:05.370 --> 29:07.450]  it's kind of cousins
[29:07.450 --> 29:08.570]  in that avenue.
[29:08.570 --> 29:10.170]  They don't really wash well either.
[29:10.170 --> 29:12.370]  And we kind of got a late start.
[29:12.370 --> 29:15.010]  We had some logistical issues
[29:15.010 --> 29:16.810]  that we had to kind of figure out
[29:16.810 --> 29:17.810]  dry space.
[29:18.970 --> 29:20.690]  It was kind of a hectic harvest
[29:20.690 --> 29:22.770]  season where,
[29:22.770 --> 29:24.570]  you know, stabilizing that that
[29:24.570 --> 29:25.930]  Jolly Rancher, which was about a
[29:25.930 --> 29:28.250]  third of our garden in total
[29:28.250 --> 29:30.210]  was huge.
[29:30.210 --> 29:32.290]  That could, you know, I'm guessing
[29:32.290 --> 29:33.770]  probably save the season is going to
[29:33.770 --> 29:36.130]  help us really be able to
[29:36.130 --> 29:38.690]  be able to make it into a
[29:38.690 --> 29:40.930]  profitable season
[29:40.930 --> 29:43.210]  in this crazy fall out of
[29:43.210 --> 29:44.570]  market conditions that we're looking
[29:44.570 --> 29:45.490]  at.
[29:45.490 --> 29:47.730]  I know I just it really obsessed
[29:47.730 --> 29:49.090]  me what those fucking middlemen are
[29:49.090 --> 29:49.810]  doing to you guys.
[29:49.810 --> 29:51.250]  It's just not right.
[29:51.250 --> 29:53.090]  And the despots out there, they're
[29:53.090 --> 29:55.130]  selling crap, absolute crap,
[29:55.130 --> 29:57.010]  little pin fucking popcorn
[29:57.010 --> 29:59.050]  nuggets that have no flavor.
[29:59.050 --> 30:00.610]  Burn your fucking throat.
[30:00.610 --> 30:02.210]  And there's all this killer smoke
[30:02.210 --> 30:04.050]  up north that we can't get.
[30:04.050 --> 30:05.850]  And I don't know how to fix
[30:05.850 --> 30:07.330]  that system other than blow it up and
[30:07.330 --> 30:08.410]  start it over.
[30:08.410 --> 30:10.250]  But the state really fucked you guys
[30:10.250 --> 30:12.210]  out of a lot of power that you
[30:12.210 --> 30:14.010]  you know, that you deserve.
[30:14.010 --> 30:16.570]  You should be able to move forward.
[30:16.570 --> 30:18.250]  It's really unfortunate.
[30:18.250 --> 30:20.450]  And, you know, I think a lot of
[30:20.450 --> 30:22.290]  what can be done and it's going to be
[30:22.290 --> 30:24.370]  a slow process is educating
[30:24.370 --> 30:25.370]  the consumer,
[30:26.370 --> 30:27.810]  educating the consumer
[30:29.210 --> 30:31.250]  about, you know, what
[30:31.250 --> 30:33.050]  people are shopping for for THC
[30:33.050 --> 30:34.370]  percentage.
[30:34.370 --> 30:35.530]  You know, they have they're not
[30:35.530 --> 30:37.610]  asking about a COA
[30:37.610 --> 30:39.610]  with a terpene analysis.
[30:39.610 --> 30:41.210]  And, you know, a lot of these places
[30:41.210 --> 30:42.730]  you can't even open up the jars to
[30:42.730 --> 30:43.570]  smell it.
[30:43.570 --> 30:44.930]  You know, you're just kind of going
[30:44.930 --> 30:46.490]  on. Hey, what do you like?
[30:46.490 --> 30:47.490]  What's good?
[30:47.490 --> 30:48.450]  What's the term?
[30:48.450 --> 30:50.250]  What's you know, it has the
[30:50.250 --> 30:52.650]  the catchy name.
[30:52.650 --> 30:54.490]  It has, you know, the high THC
[30:54.490 --> 30:55.370]  with a catchy name.
[30:55.370 --> 30:57.730]  So I think educating
[30:57.730 --> 30:59.530]  the consumer is going to be really
[30:59.570 --> 31:00.570]  like an important
[31:01.490 --> 31:02.490]  thing that
[31:03.770 --> 31:05.450]  farmers, smaller farmers are going
[31:05.450 --> 31:07.410]  to have to do to stay relevant
[31:07.410 --> 31:09.210]  and to to kind
[31:09.210 --> 31:10.890]  of stay in business.
[31:10.890 --> 31:12.330]  Well, I think that, you know, that
[31:12.330 --> 31:13.890]  some of the work like the Gondar is
[31:13.890 --> 31:15.770]  going to be a big help, whether
[31:15.770 --> 31:17.330]  the dispose actually take the
[31:17.330 --> 31:19.490]  position to educate their
[31:19.490 --> 31:20.490]  employees.
[31:20.490 --> 31:22.010]  That's going to be another big
[31:22.010 --> 31:23.010]  factor.
[31:23.930 --> 31:24.890]  But yeah, I agree with you.
[31:24.890 --> 31:26.810]  I mean, it's it really is education.
[31:26.810 --> 31:28.970]  I mean, you you smoke side by side.
[31:28.970 --> 31:30.570]  These two synthetic versus, you
[31:30.570 --> 31:32.210]  know, regenerative and it's fucking
[31:32.210 --> 31:33.930]  night and day, night and
[31:33.930 --> 31:34.690]  day.
[31:34.690 --> 31:36.130]  And I just feel horrible for you
[31:36.130 --> 31:37.250]  guys that have fought through
[31:37.250 --> 31:38.250]  licensing.
[31:38.250 --> 31:40.370]  And oh my God, the regulatory
[31:40.370 --> 31:42.810]  shit you guys had to go through.
[31:42.810 --> 31:44.490]  You know, I've been like living, you
[31:44.490 --> 31:46.210]  know, with the not living, but
[31:46.210 --> 31:47.850]  deeply connected with the Humboldt
[31:47.850 --> 31:49.690]  area after those region
[31:49.690 --> 31:51.570]  conferences and watching
[31:51.570 --> 31:53.330]  the progress from, you know, the
[31:53.330 --> 31:55.170]  beginnings to where it is
[31:55.170 --> 31:57.770]  now over the last four years.
[31:57.770 --> 31:58.650]  That's insane.
[31:58.650 --> 32:00.170]  It's absolutely insane.
[32:00.170 --> 32:01.970]  You know, and I wish I
[32:01.970 --> 32:03.650]  wish the best of luck to all you
[32:03.650 --> 32:05.650]  guys that you don't end up crashing
[32:05.650 --> 32:07.490]  and burning. And because of
[32:07.490 --> 32:08.650]  this market bullshit,
[32:09.690 --> 32:11.010]  you know, all I can say is stay
[32:11.010 --> 32:13.050]  fucking tough, stay strong and
[32:13.050 --> 32:14.970]  come up with other methods of
[32:14.970 --> 32:16.490]  whatever you have to do to fucking
[32:16.490 --> 32:18.370]  survive, because what you
[32:18.370 --> 32:19.530]  guys are doing up there is
[32:19.530 --> 32:20.730]  incredible work.
[32:20.730 --> 32:22.650]  That spot is just like
[32:22.650 --> 32:24.210]  you said, paradise.
[32:24.210 --> 32:26.890]  It's just has such unique
[32:26.890 --> 32:28.570]  special qualities to
[32:28.570 --> 32:30.490]  and anybody who has never been to
[32:30.490 --> 32:32.130]  Humboldt, you've got to go.
[32:32.130 --> 32:34.410]  You've got to check this place out.
[32:34.410 --> 32:36.050]  It's so special.
[32:36.050 --> 32:37.770]  So anyway,
[32:37.770 --> 32:39.690]  were you using any kind of amendments
[32:39.690 --> 32:42.450]  at all during the season or before?
[32:42.450 --> 32:44.010]  So, yes, we did.
[32:44.010 --> 32:45.010]  We did.
[32:45.930 --> 32:47.930]  You know, I kind of was was given
[32:47.930 --> 32:49.810]  the position by someone who took it
[32:49.810 --> 32:51.650]  on and then he just kind of put
[32:51.650 --> 32:54.530]  me there, had like a general
[32:54.530 --> 32:56.410]  like game plan and was just like,
[32:56.410 --> 32:57.650]  go do it.
[32:57.650 --> 33:00.250]  So we did amend.
[33:00.250 --> 33:02.090]  We just top dressed with some some
[33:02.090 --> 33:03.210]  organic amendments
[33:04.290 --> 33:06.250]  and also some
[33:06.250 --> 33:08.010]  worm castings.
[33:08.010 --> 33:11.090]  I'm a big fan of that castings.
[33:11.090 --> 33:13.170]  But really, you know,
[33:13.170 --> 33:15.370]  once again, seeing all these
[33:15.370 --> 33:17.610]  these other farmers in the area,
[33:17.610 --> 33:18.770]  these guys are hardcore.
[33:18.770 --> 33:20.370]  They are like the crunchiest people
[33:20.370 --> 33:22.450]  I think I've ever I've ever
[33:22.450 --> 33:23.970]  observed their work.
[33:23.970 --> 33:26.370]  They're not amending their soil.
[33:26.530 --> 33:29.090]  They're not watering their soil.
[33:29.090 --> 33:31.170]  They're not trellising their plants.
[33:31.170 --> 33:34.090]  And they just have amazing results.
[33:34.090 --> 33:36.690]  So, you know, I I am still
[33:36.690 --> 33:38.930]  going to pitch and get a soil test,
[33:38.930 --> 33:41.130]  a soil analysis done so we can see
[33:41.130 --> 33:42.570]  if anything's out of whack, see if we
[33:42.570 --> 33:44.250]  need to add anything in there.
[33:44.250 --> 33:47.530]  But, you know, if if it comes back
[33:47.530 --> 33:49.530]  looking good, I'm just we're just
[33:49.530 --> 33:50.290]  going to run with it.
[33:50.290 --> 33:51.850]  You know, we're not going to add
[33:51.850 --> 33:53.610]  anything if we don't have to.
[33:53.610 --> 33:55.570]  It doesn't make sense financially to
[33:55.610 --> 33:58.130]  be throwing throwing amendments
[33:58.130 --> 34:00.370]  onto a field if it's already has
[34:00.370 --> 34:02.410]  what it needs to to be,
[34:02.410 --> 34:03.730]  you know, a fruitful season.
[34:05.010 --> 34:06.570]  How, you know, there's no point.
[34:06.570 --> 34:08.570]  How long has Humboldt known about dry
[34:08.570 --> 34:11.250]  farming? Because it does seem
[34:11.250 --> 34:13.170]  risky, I guess, unless you you've
[34:13.170 --> 34:14.570]  seen the process yourself.
[34:14.570 --> 34:16.930]  So is that a generational thing?
[34:16.930 --> 34:18.330]  And that's why they're so confident
[34:18.330 --> 34:19.410]  in that and they're not out there
[34:19.410 --> 34:20.170]  really tending it.
[34:20.170 --> 34:21.570]  They just know that basically
[34:21.570 --> 34:23.490]  Mother Nature will take care of itself.
[34:23.490 --> 34:25.330]  Well, the craziest thing is that
[34:25.330 --> 34:27.250]  they use the word dry.
[34:27.250 --> 34:29.050]  It shouldn't be dry farming.
[34:29.050 --> 34:29.970]  It should be.
[34:32.050 --> 34:33.250]  What's the correct word?
[34:33.250 --> 34:37.450]  Floodplain growing or floodplain
[34:37.450 --> 34:39.210]  associated because there's so much
[34:39.210 --> 34:41.570]  groundwater oozing out through that
[34:41.570 --> 34:44.050]  floodplain from the mountain sides
[34:44.050 --> 34:46.090]  that you're getting a constant, fresh,
[34:46.090 --> 34:48.530]  highly mineralized water
[34:48.530 --> 34:50.530]  along with all those AMOs.
[34:50.530 --> 34:52.650]  So it's like it's a funny
[34:52.650 --> 34:53.810]  it's a funny term.
[34:53.810 --> 34:55.570]  You know, I don't know why they call
[34:55.570 --> 34:57.210]  it dry farming because it really
[34:57.210 --> 34:58.410]  isn't dry farming.
[34:58.410 --> 35:00.330]  There's there's so much water and soil
[35:00.330 --> 35:02.490]  naturally that and again,
[35:02.490 --> 35:05.050]  mineral rich groundwater
[35:05.050 --> 35:08.770]  is loaded with with fungi and biology.
[35:08.770 --> 35:11.370]  You really in nature, you cannot
[35:11.370 --> 35:13.050]  find a better way.
[35:13.050 --> 35:14.410]  And that's why if you look at all
[35:14.410 --> 35:16.530]  rivers, they're always farmed
[35:16.530 --> 35:18.690]  up and down both sides of it because
[35:18.690 --> 35:20.450]  the river naturally brings in fresh
[35:20.450 --> 35:22.730]  silt, which is all fresh organic
[35:22.730 --> 35:24.370]  matter broken down to what's called
[35:24.370 --> 35:26.690]  mom mineral associated organic
[35:26.690 --> 35:29.050]  matter, which is like worm castings.
[35:29.050 --> 35:30.570]  It's just like pure friggin worm
[35:30.570 --> 35:31.730]  castings.
[35:31.730 --> 35:33.730]  So just before he talks, just I
[35:33.730 --> 35:35.450]  wanted to like kind of let the
[35:35.450 --> 35:37.570]  audience know that it's
[35:37.570 --> 35:40.210]  the word dry shouldn't be in there.
[35:40.210 --> 35:41.930]  They're getting water.
[35:41.930 --> 35:43.210]  You're 100 percent right.
[35:43.210 --> 35:45.490]  I mean, if you dig a foot
[35:45.490 --> 35:47.370]  down, this is kind of when I also
[35:47.370 --> 35:49.410]  was had the confidence to just
[35:49.410 --> 35:51.130]  shut off the water completely.
[35:51.170 --> 35:53.170]  You dig a foot down, the
[35:53.170 --> 35:54.770]  soil is moist enough where you can
[35:54.770 --> 35:55.850]  ball it up.
[35:55.850 --> 35:57.410]  And this is like in an area that
[35:57.410 --> 36:00.290]  there was no no irrigation,
[36:00.290 --> 36:01.250]  no plants near it.
[36:01.250 --> 36:03.210]  And yeah, I took a shovel, dug a foot
[36:03.210 --> 36:05.570]  down, soil is darker,
[36:05.570 --> 36:07.570]  clumps together.
[36:07.570 --> 36:09.210]  And I was just like, OK, there's
[36:09.210 --> 36:10.450]  water there.
[36:10.450 --> 36:12.770]  I heard one of the
[36:12.770 --> 36:14.890]  the farmers in the area
[36:14.890 --> 36:17.210]  on one of the radio programs
[36:17.210 --> 36:19.450]  that happens here in Humboldt.
[36:19.490 --> 36:21.370]  And she had mentioned how they
[36:21.370 --> 36:23.410]  had some kind of device
[36:23.410 --> 36:25.250]  to measure moisture in
[36:25.250 --> 36:26.130]  the field.
[36:26.130 --> 36:28.570]  And on a hot day,
[36:28.570 --> 36:30.490]  she took the moisture meters
[36:30.490 --> 36:31.730]  and she was like, it was like we
[36:31.730 --> 36:34.130]  drenched like like hundreds
[36:34.130 --> 36:35.650]  of thousands of gallons of water,
[36:35.650 --> 36:37.010]  like the field was at pretty much
[36:37.010 --> 36:38.970]  field capacity.
[36:38.970 --> 36:41.450]  And she mentioned the hotter it is,
[36:41.450 --> 36:43.410]  the more the less
[36:43.410 --> 36:45.250]  you need to irrigate because the
[36:45.250 --> 36:46.970]  water is wicking up because of
[36:46.970 --> 36:48.770]  this like kind of this pole,
[36:49.090 --> 36:50.930]  it's dry on the surface and
[36:50.930 --> 36:52.930]  it's it's pulling all that moisture
[36:52.930 --> 36:54.650]  right up to the plants
[36:54.650 --> 36:56.610]  and and up through
[36:56.610 --> 36:58.210]  that soil system.
[36:58.210 --> 37:00.210]  So, yeah, it's really
[37:00.210 --> 37:02.490]  incredible to see that
[37:02.490 --> 37:04.370]  and kind of take that leap of
[37:04.370 --> 37:06.130]  faith because it's it's it's like
[37:06.130 --> 37:07.890]  nerve wracking, you know,
[37:07.890 --> 37:09.090]  just thinking about it, like, oh,
[37:09.090 --> 37:10.210]  I'm going to shut the water off.
[37:10.210 --> 37:11.530]  And I was waiting to show up to the
[37:11.530 --> 37:12.810]  field and have all the plants
[37:12.810 --> 37:14.890]  wilting simultaneously.
[37:14.890 --> 37:16.930]  And no, there was no
[37:16.930 --> 37:18.450]  issue. There was more issues when we
[37:18.450 --> 37:19.770]  were watering.
[37:19.770 --> 37:20.770]  Yeah.
[37:22.450 --> 37:24.090]  That's just hydrodynamics and it's
[37:24.090 --> 37:26.090]  hard to trust, but it works.
[37:26.090 --> 37:27.450]  And that's like the, you know, the
[37:27.450 --> 37:29.410]  horizontal soil system, it performs
[37:29.410 --> 37:31.330]  the same way, but it gives
[37:31.330 --> 37:33.090]  you that fast rooting
[37:33.090 --> 37:35.130]  that everybody's looking for while
[37:35.130 --> 37:36.650]  it still maintains that wicking
[37:36.650 --> 37:38.610]  ability. So,
[37:38.610 --> 37:40.050]  yeah, I agree with you.
[37:40.050 --> 37:41.770]  I think personally you should take a
[37:41.770 --> 37:44.250]  soil test just just because
[37:44.250 --> 37:46.050]  why not give yourself that little
[37:46.050 --> 37:47.890]  bit of education?
[37:47.890 --> 37:49.210]  Chances are it's going to come back
[37:49.210 --> 37:51.130]  perfect because, I mean, you are in
[37:51.130 --> 37:53.170]  like the best soil you could possibly
[37:53.170 --> 37:54.970]  imagine and it's performing
[37:54.970 --> 37:56.770]  perfectly. So but I
[37:56.770 --> 37:57.730]  agree with you. You know, you might
[37:57.730 --> 37:59.330]  be a little low on calcium, your
[37:59.330 --> 38:00.730]  saturated pace might be just a
[38:00.730 --> 38:02.570]  little bit out of balance and you
[38:02.570 --> 38:04.650]  could so easily fix those with
[38:04.650 --> 38:06.410]  natural farming preps.
[38:06.410 --> 38:07.410]  So I agree with you.
[38:07.410 --> 38:09.450]  I think that makes the most sense as
[38:09.450 --> 38:11.130]  an educated person that's looking
[38:11.130 --> 38:12.890]  for, you know, the best
[38:12.890 --> 38:14.490]  possible course of action.
[38:15.770 --> 38:17.850]  Do you feel like the old heads
[38:17.850 --> 38:20.210]  out there in Humboldt, like that's
[38:20.210 --> 38:21.810]  that's their style?
[38:21.810 --> 38:23.290]  Like, yeah, there's all these other
[38:23.290 --> 38:25.010]  different things. But, you know,
[38:25.010 --> 38:26.050]  I've never personally been to
[38:26.050 --> 38:28.370]  Humboldt, so there's always
[38:28.370 --> 38:30.090]  a variety of things of how people
[38:30.090 --> 38:31.210]  feel about it and that kind of
[38:31.210 --> 38:32.970]  stuff. But the main thing with the
[38:32.970 --> 38:34.530]  microbial life has always been like,
[38:34.530 --> 38:35.610]  yeah, it's closer to the Redwood
[38:35.610 --> 38:36.850]  Forest.
[38:36.850 --> 38:38.970]  There's just the variety
[38:38.970 --> 38:41.050]  since there's so diverse, you're
[38:41.050 --> 38:42.850]  able to just basically
[38:42.850 --> 38:44.690]  build a utopia
[38:44.690 --> 38:46.490]  because you're close enough to where
[38:46.490 --> 38:47.850]  that utopia exists.
[38:49.050 --> 38:51.410]  Knowing that in Humboldt is that
[38:51.410 --> 38:53.410]  I guess my question is the old heads,
[38:53.410 --> 38:55.810]  their style is more of the
[38:55.810 --> 38:58.010]  what you call it, the flood
[38:58.010 --> 38:59.290]  flood farming there.
[38:59.290 --> 39:02.290]  Like floodplain farming.
[39:02.290 --> 39:03.770]  Do you feel like a lot of the older
[39:03.770 --> 39:05.130]  generations, because you come across
[39:05.130 --> 39:07.330]  as fairly young to me, Johnny, to
[39:07.330 --> 39:09.170]  to, you know, really be rocking it
[39:09.170 --> 39:09.930]  the way you are, man.
[39:09.930 --> 39:10.810]  So kudos to you.
[39:10.810 --> 39:12.570]  But, you know, when you are learning
[39:12.570 --> 39:14.330]  and you have different mentors, does
[39:14.330 --> 39:15.570]  that seem like that's where
[39:16.770 --> 39:18.250]  quote unquote, I hope I don't
[39:18.250 --> 39:19.570]  disrespect, but it seems like that's
[39:19.570 --> 39:21.450]  where the farmers, farmers usually go
[39:21.450 --> 39:23.570]  to try to figure out stuff
[39:23.570 --> 39:25.490]  at the the large
[39:25.490 --> 39:26.850]  commercial outdoor level.
[39:28.450 --> 39:30.770]  You know, it's honestly, it
[39:30.770 --> 39:33.010]  really is a tight little community
[39:33.010 --> 39:35.050]  of people, and it's such a small
[39:36.210 --> 39:38.090]  area that you can really pull it off
[39:38.090 --> 39:40.050]  successfully where,
[39:40.050 --> 39:41.610]  you know, it's it's
[39:42.650 --> 39:44.770]  it's pretty much most people
[39:44.770 --> 39:45.770]  it's unheard of.
[39:46.690 --> 39:47.890]  And they'll look at you like you're
[39:47.890 --> 39:49.410]  crazy. Some of these people who have
[39:49.410 --> 39:51.410]  been doing it for are like in
[39:51.410 --> 39:53.970]  the game for, you know,
[39:53.970 --> 39:56.370]  a decade, two decades, you know, 30
[39:56.370 --> 39:58.290]  even, you know, my first boss I had
[39:58.290 --> 40:00.090]  out here, he was he came up here in
[40:00.090 --> 40:03.010]  the late 70s, I think.
[40:03.010 --> 40:05.130]  And he you know, he was
[40:05.130 --> 40:07.010]  my first boss I had and he was
[40:07.010 --> 40:08.730]  growing, you know, potting soil,
[40:10.050 --> 40:11.370]  you know, all synthetic.
[40:12.410 --> 40:13.450]  So it really is.
[40:13.450 --> 40:15.490]  There's a wide spectrum of different
[40:15.530 --> 40:17.650]  styles of growing that's going
[40:17.650 --> 40:18.650]  on here.
[40:18.650 --> 40:20.570]  But yeah, it is.
[40:20.570 --> 40:22.570]  It's, you know, people kind
[40:22.570 --> 40:25.130]  of look at you like
[40:25.130 --> 40:26.490]  even some of the older heads, they'll
[40:26.490 --> 40:27.690]  look at you like you're crazy.
[40:27.690 --> 40:29.090]  You know, if they don't live in that
[40:29.090 --> 40:30.890]  particular region, there's only it's
[40:30.890 --> 40:32.410]  a really small little pocket.
[40:33.930 --> 40:36.010]  So, yeah, like I, you know.
[40:37.250 --> 40:38.610]  I didn't know what to think about it
[40:38.610 --> 40:40.370]  at first, I was like, no way.
[40:40.370 --> 40:42.090]  Or is this like is this actually
[40:42.090 --> 40:44.210]  happening? You know, the common
[40:44.210 --> 40:46.210]  mentality in cannabis is always
[40:46.210 --> 40:48.650]  like more, more, more, more water.
[40:48.650 --> 40:49.610]  They need more water.
[40:49.610 --> 40:51.130]  They need more nutrients.
[40:51.130 --> 40:52.490]  You just got to jack them full of
[40:52.490 --> 40:53.490]  everything.
[40:53.490 --> 40:54.490]  Cow.
[40:56.130 --> 40:58.290]  Some cow mag, more cow bell.
[40:58.290 --> 41:00.490]  And, you know, I feel like
[41:00.490 --> 41:02.490]  it honestly, if the plants
[41:02.490 --> 41:04.410]  have access to what they need,
[41:05.970 --> 41:08.130]  they're going to perform, you know,
[41:08.130 --> 41:09.530]  I feel like at their fullest
[41:09.530 --> 41:11.650]  potential, which is why organic
[41:11.650 --> 41:13.530]  cultivation in my eyes is
[41:13.850 --> 41:15.690]  superior than growing synthetically,
[41:15.690 --> 41:17.690]  because, yeah, a salt
[41:17.690 --> 41:19.890]  is a salt in an organic
[41:19.890 --> 41:21.330]  material is getting broken down to
[41:21.330 --> 41:23.210]  the salt. But having that kind of
[41:23.210 --> 41:25.170]  symbiotic relationship with the
[41:25.170 --> 41:27.130]  microbes in the exudates and
[41:27.130 --> 41:28.850]  being able to pick and choose what it
[41:28.850 --> 41:30.610]  wants to eat, when it wants to eat
[41:30.610 --> 41:32.250]  it versus sticking a funnel down the
[41:32.250 --> 41:34.090]  plant's throat and just
[41:34.090 --> 41:35.650]  force feeding it and trying to play
[41:35.650 --> 41:36.650]  God.
[41:37.010 --> 41:38.850]  I feel like you just you're more
[41:38.850 --> 41:40.330]  consistently going to end up with
[41:40.330 --> 41:41.330]  an excellent,
[41:41.730 --> 41:43.450]  excellent plant health and excellent
[41:43.450 --> 41:45.330]  end quality products because
[41:45.330 --> 41:46.930]  you're allowing the plant to pick and
[41:46.930 --> 41:48.690]  choose what it wants to take from
[41:48.690 --> 41:49.690]  the soil.
[41:49.690 --> 41:51.490]  And with the water, too, I mean, with
[41:51.490 --> 41:53.130]  the dry farming, the water's there,
[41:53.130 --> 41:55.130]  but it's not like
[41:55.130 --> 41:56.530]  they're not getting like dry and
[41:56.530 --> 41:58.250]  you're not forcing them to do it.
[41:58.250 --> 41:59.770]  You know, they have what they want.
[41:59.770 --> 42:01.850]  There's plenty of drier areas where
[42:01.850 --> 42:03.250]  the roots can go.
[42:03.250 --> 42:04.770]  And I feel like it's just really
[42:04.770 --> 42:06.290]  like a you know, all you can eat
[42:06.290 --> 42:08.490]  buffet for the plant, but the plants
[42:08.490 --> 42:10.090]  just, you know, picking and choosing
[42:11.090 --> 42:12.450]  what it wants, when it's going to
[42:12.450 --> 42:14.610]  drink, how much it's going to drink.
[42:14.610 --> 42:16.570]  So I feel like, yeah, allowing
[42:16.570 --> 42:19.170]  the plant to do its thing
[42:19.170 --> 42:21.210]  and not trying to play God is like
[42:21.210 --> 42:23.250]  really it's a great way to get
[42:23.250 --> 42:25.170]  a superior product at the end
[42:25.170 --> 42:26.370]  of the day.
[42:26.370 --> 42:28.210]  Yeah, it's like farming with a new
[42:28.210 --> 42:29.850]  eyes in a way, like there's just a
[42:29.850 --> 42:31.330]  new paradigm once you start to
[42:31.330 --> 42:32.130]  understand that.
[42:32.130 --> 42:33.890]  And I feel like Jeff Lomenfels
[42:33.890 --> 42:35.210]  have always been trying to get
[42:35.210 --> 42:36.610]  people to read those books as well,
[42:36.610 --> 42:38.410]  because for me, he
[42:38.410 --> 42:39.890]  was able to break it down enough
[42:39.890 --> 42:41.450]  where like you kind of hear some of
[42:41.450 --> 42:42.130]  those concepts.
[42:42.130 --> 42:43.250]  But then when he was breaking it
[42:43.250 --> 42:44.650]  down, he's talking about, you know,
[42:44.650 --> 42:46.370]  the plants want Chinese food tonight
[42:46.370 --> 42:48.210]  on Tuesday, but on Wednesday they
[42:48.210 --> 42:49.770]  want to have American burger on
[42:49.770 --> 42:51.170]  Wednesday, you know, when he was
[42:51.170 --> 42:52.610]  kind of explaining that this was
[42:52.610 --> 42:54.490]  obviously a while ago, but
[42:54.490 --> 42:55.610]  there wasn't really anybody that was
[42:55.610 --> 42:57.490]  talking about farming, especially
[42:57.490 --> 42:58.970]  cannabis in that manner.
[42:58.970 --> 43:00.850]  It definitely always seemed like
[43:00.850 --> 43:03.250]  they were so dependent on you.
[43:03.250 --> 43:04.530]  You know, it was almost like a joke
[43:04.530 --> 43:06.210]  like my ladies need me all the time.
[43:06.210 --> 43:07.810]  That's why I'm constantly feeding,
[43:07.810 --> 43:09.450]  phing, mixing.
[43:09.450 --> 43:11.250]  But the reality is, is that when
[43:11.250 --> 43:12.810]  real information comes your way,
[43:12.810 --> 43:14.250]  you start to see that, well,
[43:14.250 --> 43:15.450]  obviously this makes sense.
[43:15.450 --> 43:17.090]  Mother Nature takes care of it,
[43:17.090 --> 43:18.450]  care of its own.
[43:18.450 --> 43:19.890]  Why would we be farming in any
[43:19.890 --> 43:20.890]  other way?
[43:21.610 --> 43:23.290]  It goes back to trusting the
[43:23.290 --> 43:24.170]  process.
[43:24.170 --> 43:26.370]  You know, we as a human
[43:26.370 --> 43:28.450]  want to control things and
[43:28.450 --> 43:29.450]  that's what we've been taught.
[43:29.450 --> 43:31.490]  We have to control nature.
[43:31.490 --> 43:32.970]  That was our one of our biggest
[43:32.970 --> 43:34.570]  mistakes as a species.
[43:34.570 --> 43:36.290]  And, you know, here's here again,
[43:36.450 --> 43:37.610]  trust the process.
[43:37.610 --> 43:38.610]  Right, Brian?
[43:38.610 --> 43:40.330]  And that's that's hard to let go.
[43:41.930 --> 43:43.370]  So when it comes down to the
[43:43.370 --> 43:44.850]  microbial life that you have out
[43:44.850 --> 43:46.330]  there, is there certain things?
[43:46.330 --> 43:47.370]  Have you put that under a
[43:47.370 --> 43:49.170]  microscope and seen like just the
[43:49.170 --> 43:50.610]  drastic difference of what you're
[43:50.610 --> 43:52.050]  probably working with compared to
[43:52.050 --> 43:54.050]  people that barely
[43:54.050 --> 43:54.810]  have any soil?
[43:54.810 --> 43:55.970]  They got to kind of build that up
[43:55.970 --> 43:56.970]  from a dirt level.
[43:58.170 --> 44:00.330]  Are there certain beneficials or
[44:00.330 --> 44:01.330]  that kind of thing?
[44:01.850 --> 44:04.210]  So I think that's going to be
[44:04.210 --> 44:05.930]  my Christmas present to myself, a
[44:05.930 --> 44:07.890]  microscope so
[44:07.890 --> 44:09.730]  I can I can nerd out and I finally
[44:09.730 --> 44:10.770]  have some time.
[44:10.770 --> 44:12.450]  It's nice to be on the more
[44:12.450 --> 44:14.890]  seasonal gig again
[44:14.890 --> 44:17.170]  versus working a nine to five
[44:17.170 --> 44:18.650]  because that's just you know, it's
[44:18.650 --> 44:19.650]  really draining.
[44:20.490 --> 44:22.610]  So like being being seasonal,
[44:22.610 --> 44:24.890]  working along with the the
[44:24.890 --> 44:25.890]  different
[44:26.850 --> 44:27.930]  different times of year, I'm going
[44:27.930 --> 44:29.130]  to have a lot of downtime this
[44:29.130 --> 44:31.250]  winter. So I really do want to
[44:31.250 --> 44:33.050]  get a microscope and do some work,
[44:33.050 --> 44:34.570]  check the field.
[44:34.570 --> 44:35.890]  But, you know, there is there was
[44:35.890 --> 44:38.170]  visible signs of biology.
[44:39.010 --> 44:40.370]  You know, it was kind of once it was
[44:40.370 --> 44:42.570]  dry, you know, everything
[44:42.570 --> 44:44.730]  kind of went into dormancy.
[44:44.730 --> 44:46.330]  But as soon as we got a little bit
[44:46.330 --> 44:47.530]  of moisture, you know, there was
[44:47.530 --> 44:49.090]  mushrooms popping up in the field
[44:50.290 --> 44:52.010]  in something that's that's kind of
[44:52.010 --> 44:53.610]  it was counterintuitive for me to
[44:53.610 --> 44:55.330]  going into the system and I had to
[44:55.330 --> 44:57.170]  unlearn or at least
[44:57.170 --> 44:59.250]  be willing to try something new
[44:59.250 --> 45:01.570]  is, yeah, the dry farming practice.
[45:01.570 --> 45:03.810]  It's it's not a no till system.
[45:04.570 --> 45:06.410]  So, you know, all these people,
[45:06.410 --> 45:07.610]  they are there.
[45:07.610 --> 45:09.170]  They're tilling their rows.
[45:09.170 --> 45:11.450]  They're they're tilling
[45:11.450 --> 45:14.170]  to get that to kind of break that
[45:14.170 --> 45:16.930]  hard pan to allow the wicking
[45:16.930 --> 45:18.890]  effect to really come into play.
[45:18.890 --> 45:20.370]  So that was something that I was
[45:20.370 --> 45:21.810]  like, I've been spending all this
[45:21.810 --> 45:23.410]  time learning, learning these no
[45:23.410 --> 45:24.810]  till systems.
[45:24.810 --> 45:26.650]  And, you know, here it is something
[45:26.650 --> 45:27.930]  where it's like, you know, you're
[45:27.930 --> 45:30.090]  kind of tilling by necessity.
[45:30.090 --> 45:32.010]  But so next year I have kind of
[45:32.010 --> 45:34.250]  a plan to mitigate.
[45:34.250 --> 45:35.930]  I want to try to do a little damage
[45:35.930 --> 45:37.450]  control and I would like to get a
[45:37.450 --> 45:39.610]  sprayer and spray light
[45:39.610 --> 45:41.610]  applications of IMO
[45:41.610 --> 45:44.130]  or liquid IMO on the soil and
[45:44.130 --> 45:46.170]  lots of JADAM microbial solution
[45:47.210 --> 45:48.370]  just to try to.
[45:49.490 --> 45:51.170]  Compensate, I guess, for the
[45:51.170 --> 45:53.050]  disturbance in the soil,
[45:53.050 --> 45:54.570]  I feel I have like a little guilt
[45:55.890 --> 45:57.810]  and doing that, but so I want to
[45:57.810 --> 45:59.570]  just kind of kind of just
[45:59.570 --> 46:01.370]  keep inoculating the field this
[46:01.370 --> 46:03.330]  winter, I'm going to do some
[46:03.650 --> 46:04.890]  JADAM microbial solution
[46:04.890 --> 46:06.010]  inoculations.
[46:07.330 --> 46:09.370]  I've also been I took some of the
[46:10.290 --> 46:12.010]  kind of the product that wasn't
[46:12.010 --> 46:13.810]  worth harvesting and saving just
[46:13.810 --> 46:15.610]  kind of was over overripe.
[46:15.610 --> 46:17.530]  And I put that in a bucket
[46:17.530 --> 46:19.570]  with some water and leaf mold to
[46:19.570 --> 46:21.450]  putrefy, which I plan
[46:21.450 --> 46:23.810]  on drenching back into the soil
[46:24.970 --> 46:26.450]  to just try to keep the loop as
[46:26.450 --> 46:28.010]  close as possible, you know, because
[46:28.010 --> 46:30.330]  we're taking all that material out.
[46:30.330 --> 46:32.250]  I put all the stocks back in the
[46:32.250 --> 46:34.090]  field to decompose all the
[46:34.090 --> 46:35.690]  root balls. Obviously, they're still
[46:35.690 --> 46:36.850]  there.
[46:36.850 --> 46:38.650]  But yeah, I want to try to
[46:38.650 --> 46:40.490]  just give back a little bit and not
[46:40.490 --> 46:41.770]  just take and take and take.
[46:41.770 --> 46:42.850]  And I feel like that's a really
[46:42.850 --> 46:45.090]  important process
[46:45.090 --> 46:46.610]  to just kind of give back a little
[46:46.610 --> 46:48.130]  bit. And usually people don't do
[46:48.130 --> 46:49.850]  that with cannabis because it's
[46:49.850 --> 46:50.850]  it's expensive.
[46:50.850 --> 46:51.890]  You know, it's a cash crop.
[46:51.890 --> 46:53.810]  But, you know, we had, you know,
[46:53.810 --> 46:55.370]  some plants that were just like kind
[46:55.370 --> 46:57.210]  of not worth saving.
[46:57.210 --> 46:58.810]  And I'm like, what a perfect time to
[46:58.810 --> 47:00.770]  make some fertilizer with them
[47:00.770 --> 47:02.170]  so I could put it back on the field
[47:02.170 --> 47:03.570]  to just try to keep that fertility
[47:03.570 --> 47:05.450]  up. And, you know, even if
[47:05.450 --> 47:07.330]  we do have to amend the soil,
[47:07.330 --> 47:08.530]  I feel like the amendments we're
[47:08.530 --> 47:09.770]  going to have to add are going to be
[47:09.770 --> 47:12.050]  significantly less because
[47:12.050 --> 47:13.690]  we're returning a lot of that
[47:13.690 --> 47:16.330]  material right back to the soil.
[47:16.330 --> 47:17.530]  You know, and here's here's another
[47:17.530 --> 47:19.210]  little trick for you that I saw
[47:19.210 --> 47:20.210]  somebody doing,
[47:22.410 --> 47:24.010]  because they too are also in a very
[47:24.010 --> 47:25.730]  fungally dominant system.
[47:25.730 --> 47:27.770]  So that's really what
[47:27.770 --> 47:29.610]  one of Humboldt's greatest thing
[47:29.610 --> 47:31.410]  is are other than,
[47:31.730 --> 47:32.530]  you know, the weather and the
[47:32.530 --> 47:34.290]  intensity of the sun is the
[47:34.290 --> 47:35.930]  fungal dominance of the soil.
[47:35.930 --> 47:38.210]  So instead of tilling, drill.
[47:38.210 --> 47:39.170]  So go drilling.
[47:39.170 --> 47:40.890]  Right. So you just drill a hole, get
[47:40.890 --> 47:42.810]  one of those little tractors with a
[47:42.810 --> 47:44.330]  fence pole digger on the back or an
[47:44.330 --> 47:46.210]  auger, pop that hole
[47:46.210 --> 47:47.530]  and it'll fluff the soil up.
[47:47.530 --> 47:49.450]  It'll create that wicking.
[47:49.450 --> 47:51.290]  And then the roots will go out into
[47:51.290 --> 47:52.930]  the existing fungal network, tie
[47:52.930 --> 47:53.930]  right in.
[47:53.930 --> 47:55.770]  And you and then whatever you're
[47:55.770 --> 47:57.730]  doing with with your IMOs,
[47:57.730 --> 47:59.290]  you're only amending that little tiny
[47:59.290 --> 48:00.690]  area that you drilled instead of
[48:00.690 --> 48:02.450]  trying to amend the whole field.
[48:02.450 --> 48:04.810]  And the fact that you're saving
[48:04.810 --> 48:07.090]  those the spent plants
[48:07.090 --> 48:09.010]  and making compost or
[48:09.010 --> 48:10.970]  jadam is a great idea.
[48:10.970 --> 48:13.010]  And that can go that like we always
[48:13.010 --> 48:15.050]  talk about feed plants, plants
[48:15.050 --> 48:17.090]  so much easier for the microbes
[48:17.090 --> 48:18.570]  to break that down than it is for
[48:18.570 --> 48:20.210]  them to break the sand, silt and
[48:20.210 --> 48:21.970]  clay down. So now you're on the
[48:21.970 --> 48:23.290]  right track, brother, big time.
[48:25.330 --> 48:27.130]  So, Leighton, this is more of a
[48:27.130 --> 48:28.370]  question for both of you, I guess,
[48:28.370 --> 48:30.330]  but what is
[48:30.330 --> 48:32.090]  the magic in where the
[48:32.090 --> 48:33.490]  Redwood Forest is like?
[48:33.490 --> 48:35.730]  It's just it has more diversity
[48:35.730 --> 48:38.010]  than anywhere else on the planet,
[48:38.010 --> 48:39.450]  you know, relatively speaking.
[48:39.450 --> 48:41.450]  Or is it, you know, as close to
[48:41.450 --> 48:43.330]  the kind of the rainforest, the real
[48:43.330 --> 48:45.370]  healthy tropical?
[48:45.370 --> 48:46.970]  I'm just I'm just kind of confused
[48:46.970 --> 48:48.610]  on what really makes it
[48:48.610 --> 48:50.090]  so, so special from.
[48:50.090 --> 48:52.010]  It's a temperate rainforest and
[48:52.010 --> 48:53.650]  there's a tremendous amount of
[48:53.650 --> 48:55.450]  undeveloped land.
[48:55.450 --> 48:57.250]  And then you add the West Coast
[48:57.250 --> 48:58.250]  sun.
[48:58.250 --> 48:59.650]  Look, I'm from the East Coast.
[49:00.010 --> 49:01.330]  In the summer, we go out in the
[49:01.330 --> 49:02.370]  sun, right?
[49:02.370 --> 49:03.850]  There's a certain window of a
[49:03.850 --> 49:05.290]  couple of weeks where the sun is
[49:05.290 --> 49:06.730]  hot on your skin.
[49:06.730 --> 49:08.250]  Out here, the sun is hot on your
[49:08.250 --> 49:09.490]  skin all the time.
[49:09.490 --> 49:10.690]  It's just high UV.
[49:10.690 --> 49:12.410]  I don't know how to explain it.
[49:12.410 --> 49:14.170]  And maybe you can dive in a little
[49:14.170 --> 49:16.010]  deeper on it, Johnny, but it's very
[49:16.010 --> 49:17.010]  unusual.
[49:17.810 --> 49:18.850]  Yeah, for sure.
[49:18.850 --> 49:20.290]  I mean, I'm from the East Coast,
[49:20.290 --> 49:22.050]  too, originally,
[49:22.050 --> 49:24.330]  and just the growing season
[49:24.330 --> 49:26.010]  in Humboldt County.
[49:26.010 --> 49:27.690]  Yeah, the daily light index, the
[49:27.690 --> 49:29.490]  amount of sun exposure, the
[49:29.730 --> 49:30.930]  latitude that it is.
[49:32.490 --> 49:33.970]  That's I feel like it's a really
[49:33.970 --> 49:35.970]  unique spot and it's kind of
[49:35.970 --> 49:37.810]  if you look at a map
[49:37.810 --> 49:39.770]  and you go across on the same
[49:39.770 --> 49:41.690]  latitude, there
[49:41.690 --> 49:43.650]  is, you know, it's kind
[49:43.650 --> 49:45.490]  of in the same region as
[49:45.490 --> 49:47.330]  Afghanistan, which is
[49:47.330 --> 49:49.250]  where a lot of modern genetics
[49:49.250 --> 49:50.370]  all stem from.
[49:50.370 --> 49:51.850]  So I feel like it's just kind of
[49:51.850 --> 49:53.650]  like people who have been doing
[49:53.650 --> 49:55.530]  heirloom genetics and they
[49:55.530 --> 49:56.770]  have been working these genetics
[49:56.770 --> 49:57.770]  for a long time. They're kind of
[49:57.770 --> 49:59.370]  already, the plants are adapted to
[49:59.370 --> 50:01.290]  that kind of latitude
[50:01.290 --> 50:02.130]  already.
[50:02.130 --> 50:05.010]  I think it's the 40th parallel.
[50:05.010 --> 50:07.010]  But as far as the
[50:07.010 --> 50:10.130]  diversity in the soil, I mean.
[50:10.130 --> 50:11.770]  Yeah, it's just a unique
[50:11.770 --> 50:13.890]  combination of,
[50:13.890 --> 50:16.090]  you know, environmental
[50:16.090 --> 50:18.130]  environmental and just its overall
[50:18.130 --> 50:19.930]  location where it's close
[50:19.930 --> 50:21.850]  to the ocean and it just
[50:21.850 --> 50:23.570]  was the perfect conditions for these
[50:23.570 --> 50:25.410]  these redwoods to just kind of take
[50:25.410 --> 50:26.410]  off.
[50:26.850 --> 50:28.690]  And with the river being there,
[50:29.450 --> 50:31.290]  it really is like the perfect storm
[50:31.290 --> 50:33.690]  of climate and just
[50:33.690 --> 50:35.690]  which I mean is location based.
[50:35.690 --> 50:36.690]  And.
[50:37.650 --> 50:39.770]  Yeah, I mean, it's in the daily
[50:39.770 --> 50:41.890]  light exposure and just the natural
[50:42.930 --> 50:45.130]  kind of vapor pressure deficit that
[50:45.130 --> 50:46.890]  nature is providing instead of being
[50:46.890 --> 50:49.010]  an indoor, you know, playing god.
[50:49.010 --> 50:50.930]  It's pretty close to
[50:50.930 --> 50:53.210]  perfect, pretty as close to perfect
[50:53.210 --> 50:55.410]  as I think I've ever seen
[50:55.410 --> 50:57.210]  or grown in where it's just
[50:57.210 --> 50:59.050]  that humidity is at the right level.
[50:59.050 --> 51:00.770]  The temperature of the sun exposure
[51:00.770 --> 51:02.210]  all day, you know.
[51:04.250 --> 51:06.130]  It's it is it's a different ball
[51:06.130 --> 51:07.970]  game or is growing cannabis where
[51:07.970 --> 51:10.050]  I'm from in upstate New York
[51:10.050 --> 51:12.930]  outside, it's going to be
[51:12.930 --> 51:14.770]  it's going to be difficult.
[51:14.770 --> 51:16.810]  The climate's not quite right.
[51:16.810 --> 51:18.850]  The amount of the season's not quite
[51:18.850 --> 51:20.330]  long enough.
[51:20.330 --> 51:22.810]  There's a lot more inclement weather
[51:22.810 --> 51:24.690]  and yeah, just the sun exposure,
[51:24.690 --> 51:27.010]  which I mean, it's that's ultimately
[51:27.010 --> 51:29.250]  the real plant food is the
[51:29.250 --> 51:31.370]  sunlight. So it's it's going to
[51:31.370 --> 51:34.650]  this region has just amazing
[51:34.650 --> 51:36.730]  amount of of sunlight throughout
[51:36.730 --> 51:38.570]  its growing season, which, you know,
[51:38.570 --> 51:40.810]  kind of leads the outdoor cannabis
[51:40.810 --> 51:41.970]  that can be grown in Humboldt.
[51:41.970 --> 51:44.810]  It really puts it on par with,
[51:44.810 --> 51:47.090]  you know, cannabis grown anywhere
[51:47.090 --> 51:49.050]  indoor in a super dialed condition.
[51:49.050 --> 51:50.890]  It's it doesn't get much better than
[51:50.890 --> 51:52.450]  outdoor cannabis and Humboldt just
[51:52.450 --> 51:55.290]  because of the climate.
[51:55.290 --> 51:56.890]  And Chris Garrow makes a very good
[51:56.890 --> 51:58.930]  point on fog, right?
[51:58.930 --> 52:00.090]  So what is fog?
[52:00.090 --> 52:01.090]  Fog is
[52:02.610 --> 52:05.370]  natural farming's saltwater
[52:05.370 --> 52:06.530]  ferment, right?
[52:06.530 --> 52:08.890]  Every day, all those trace minerals
[52:08.890 --> 52:10.690]  coming in and landing on the leaves,
[52:10.690 --> 52:12.610]  dripping down into the soil.
[52:12.610 --> 52:13.970]  It is. You're right.
[52:13.970 --> 52:16.450]  It's just like this perfect scenario
[52:16.450 --> 52:17.610]  for this plant.
[52:17.610 --> 52:19.330]  And yeah, all the genetics that have
[52:19.330 --> 52:21.010]  been being grown there for all these
[52:21.010 --> 52:22.930]  years, a lot of there
[52:22.930 --> 52:24.770]  that they brought up like children
[52:24.810 --> 52:26.810]  to live in that perfect environment.
[52:26.810 --> 52:29.010]  So, yeah, it's a special
[52:29.010 --> 52:30.530]  place, man. Again, anybody that's
[52:30.530 --> 52:31.970]  never been there, you really got to
[52:31.970 --> 52:34.010]  see it. It's it's unlike any
[52:34.010 --> 52:34.890]  place I've ever seen.
[52:34.890 --> 52:36.170]  And I've done quite a bit of traveling
[52:36.170 --> 52:37.170]  in my life.
[52:37.810 --> 52:39.530]  It's just special, really fucking
[52:39.530 --> 52:40.530]  special.
[52:41.770 --> 52:43.890]  So just the perfect environment, so
[52:43.890 --> 52:45.650]  perfect environment with a perfect
[52:45.650 --> 52:46.570]  microbial world.
[52:46.570 --> 52:48.770]  Now you have trees that look like,
[52:48.770 --> 52:50.930]  you know, almost like it's
[52:50.930 --> 52:52.530]  almost comical how big those things
[52:52.530 --> 52:53.530]  are.
[52:54.490 --> 52:55.490]  Oh, yeah.
[52:55.490 --> 52:57.530]  Don't forget, thousands of years
[52:57.530 --> 52:58.650]  old. Right.
[52:58.650 --> 53:01.330]  Some of those trees were seedlings
[53:01.330 --> 53:03.090]  when when Christ was walking
[53:03.090 --> 53:04.090]  the world. Right.
[53:04.170 --> 53:05.530]  Think about that.
[53:05.530 --> 53:06.530]  That's nuts.
[53:07.970 --> 53:09.930]  And so from what I've always learned
[53:09.930 --> 53:11.810]  is whatever is going up from a tree
[53:11.810 --> 53:13.250]  is the same that's going down.
[53:13.250 --> 53:15.610]  So the root system matches.
[53:15.610 --> 53:16.610]  Correct.
[53:16.610 --> 53:18.370]  So like whatever when you see a
[53:18.370 --> 53:20.850]  massive tree, then that has a massive
[53:20.850 --> 53:23.250]  root system that is equivalent
[53:23.330 --> 53:24.650]  in the same size.
[53:24.650 --> 53:26.770]  So Dr. Lane did some studies
[53:26.770 --> 53:28.810]  way back where they were using
[53:28.810 --> 53:30.810]  radioactive isotopes and
[53:30.810 --> 53:32.930]  watering them into the tree
[53:32.930 --> 53:34.530]  to see how long it took for them to
[53:34.530 --> 53:36.370]  get down into the roots in the
[53:36.370 --> 53:38.530]  caves that they were in
[53:38.530 --> 53:40.770]  way, way down in the earth.
[53:40.770 --> 53:42.410]  And she said it was just a matter of
[53:42.410 --> 53:44.330]  minutes from the time that they was
[53:44.330 --> 53:46.010]  it was given to the plant at the
[53:46.010 --> 53:47.330]  time that it leaked out as an
[53:47.330 --> 53:48.250]  exudate.
[53:48.250 --> 53:50.210]  So, yes, you're absolutely right,
[53:50.210 --> 53:52.450]  Brian. And this is very controversial
[53:52.450 --> 53:54.490]  because if you see like trees
[53:54.490 --> 53:56.090]  that have blown over in a hurricane,
[53:56.090 --> 53:57.210]  you really just seem kind of like
[53:57.210 --> 53:59.050]  this like clod at the top.
[53:59.050 --> 54:00.010]  Right.
[54:00.010 --> 54:01.770]  But if you look closely, there's
[54:01.770 --> 54:03.530]  always these tap roots that go or
[54:03.530 --> 54:05.570]  that tap that goes way
[54:05.570 --> 54:06.330]  the hell down.
[54:06.330 --> 54:08.050]  And we don't really know how deep it
[54:08.050 --> 54:09.970]  is because it's very difficult
[54:09.970 --> 54:11.850]  to mine to mine it out
[54:11.850 --> 54:13.690]  of it without destroying or
[54:13.690 --> 54:15.170]  disturbing the soil.
[54:15.170 --> 54:17.090]  But the biomass usually is
[54:17.090 --> 54:18.850]  equivalent. What's above is well
[54:18.850 --> 54:20.050]  below.
[54:20.050 --> 54:22.410]  Redwoods for them to be that tall.
[54:22.570 --> 54:23.930]  Yeah, there's got to be one hell of
[54:23.930 --> 54:24.850]  a tap on them.
[54:24.850 --> 54:26.850]  And that again, what he was talking
[54:26.850 --> 54:28.770]  about earlier with with,
[54:28.770 --> 54:30.890]  you know, dry farming or flood
[54:30.890 --> 54:33.130]  plain farming, you it's critical
[54:33.130 --> 54:35.010]  that you're seeded using seed, not
[54:35.010 --> 54:36.330]  clone because you're just never
[54:36.330 --> 54:39.810]  going to get the same potential
[54:39.810 --> 54:42.290]  of let's call it harvesting
[54:42.290 --> 54:44.530]  biomass below the surface
[54:44.530 --> 54:47.090]  to help pull that neutral, those
[54:47.090 --> 54:48.730]  nutrients and minerals that the
[54:48.730 --> 54:50.450]  plants asking for.
[54:50.450 --> 54:51.850]  So, again, I think I think you hit
[54:51.850 --> 54:52.850]  on so much, Johnny.
[54:52.850 --> 54:53.490]  It's not funny.
[54:53.490 --> 54:55.290]  I mean, what you're saying
[54:55.290 --> 54:57.010]  is basically, hey, don't
[54:57.010 --> 54:58.530]  don't force the plant.
[54:58.530 --> 54:59.690]  Don't push the plant.
[54:59.690 --> 55:00.850]  Just foster the plant.
[55:00.850 --> 55:02.810]  Just love it. Just give it give it
[55:02.810 --> 55:04.690]  what it's telling you and then
[55:04.690 --> 55:08.090]  stand back and let it do its thing.
[55:08.090 --> 55:09.250]  You know, that's one of the reasons
[55:09.250 --> 55:11.290]  why that forest is the size
[55:11.290 --> 55:12.290]  it is.
[55:14.330 --> 55:15.930]  So, Johnny, when you're running,
[55:15.930 --> 55:17.370]  you know, you buy six thousand
[55:17.370 --> 55:18.930]  feminized seeds, which I would
[55:18.930 --> 55:21.810]  imagine is, you know, pretty pricey.
[55:21.810 --> 55:23.850]  How do you like what do you
[55:23.850 --> 55:25.810]  expect percentage wise for
[55:25.810 --> 55:27.850]  that to come to fruition,
[55:27.850 --> 55:29.970]  to actually produce as as flowers
[55:29.970 --> 55:32.170]  that like, you know,
[55:32.170 --> 55:33.370]  I don't want to put any numbers out
[55:33.370 --> 55:35.010]  there. So what do you normally see
[55:35.010 --> 55:36.890]  when you do buy genetics
[55:36.890 --> 55:37.610]  at that level?
[55:37.610 --> 55:39.370]  Like what percentage are you happy
[55:39.370 --> 55:40.370]  with?
[55:42.410 --> 55:44.930]  You know, honestly, there
[55:44.930 --> 55:46.570]  there was some rants, there was
[55:46.570 --> 55:48.770]  some some mutants,
[55:48.770 --> 55:50.810]  which was really fun to watch.
[55:50.810 --> 55:52.490]  You know, that's this is the first
[55:52.490 --> 55:54.370]  season I've ever I planted
[55:54.370 --> 55:56.250]  stuff from seed before, but
[55:56.250 --> 55:57.850]  to do it on this level with a
[55:57.850 --> 55:59.810]  population that large
[55:59.810 --> 56:01.730]  was a real special thing to be able
[56:01.730 --> 56:03.330]  to watch unfold because, yeah, I
[56:03.330 --> 56:05.170]  was seeing all sorts of,
[56:05.170 --> 56:06.770]  you know, strange mutations where
[56:06.770 --> 56:08.530]  the plant like topped itself for
[56:08.530 --> 56:09.530]  this one plant.
[56:10.410 --> 56:12.450]  Instead of having its its apical
[56:12.450 --> 56:14.730]  stem, it had a family
[56:14.730 --> 56:16.530]  popping out of it and it had like
[56:16.530 --> 56:18.010]  two side growths and it was this,
[56:18.010 --> 56:20.170]  you know, little silly thing
[56:20.250 --> 56:21.850]  and someone accidentally planted it
[56:21.850 --> 56:22.890]  in the field.
[56:22.890 --> 56:24.370]  And I remember it was gone and I'm
[56:24.370 --> 56:25.330]  like, where'd it go? Like, I don't
[56:25.330 --> 56:26.770]  want to plant that thing.
[56:26.770 --> 56:28.530]  And sure
[56:28.530 --> 56:30.050]  enough, like a month later, I'm
[56:30.050 --> 56:32.410]  walking the field and I see
[56:32.410 --> 56:34.330]  in this thing, this little
[56:34.330 --> 56:36.450]  mutant just took right off.
[56:36.450 --> 56:38.250]  I saw the family still there,
[56:38.250 --> 56:40.050]  all awkward, like
[56:40.050 --> 56:41.530]  dumpy little thing.
[56:41.530 --> 56:43.330]  And yeah,
[56:43.330 --> 56:44.570]  and it just it took off.
[56:44.570 --> 56:45.930]  And really, though, there was.
[56:47.370 --> 56:49.090]  We had we had some
[56:49.370 --> 56:50.290]  damping off.
[56:50.290 --> 56:52.610]  We had an issue with airflow
[56:52.610 --> 56:53.970]  where we ended up losing a good
[56:53.970 --> 56:56.090]  chunk, probably like five
[56:56.090 --> 56:58.130]  hundred seeds,
[56:58.130 --> 56:59.330]  seedlings total.
[56:59.330 --> 57:01.490]  And we also had a rodent problem.
[57:01.490 --> 57:03.450]  And I'm sure
[57:03.450 --> 57:04.930]  people I mean, I've had horror
[57:04.930 --> 57:07.050]  stories with rodents just killing
[57:07.050 --> 57:07.930]  10 seedlings.
[57:07.930 --> 57:09.850]  I buy a pack of super
[57:09.850 --> 57:12.690]  special beans and I
[57:12.690 --> 57:13.730]  start germinating them.
[57:13.730 --> 57:14.970]  I go back the next day, they're all
[57:14.970 --> 57:15.970]  dead.
[57:16.690 --> 57:18.330]  So, yeah, that was that was a
[57:18.330 --> 57:20.210]  struggle where, you know, I
[57:20.210 --> 57:21.410]  kind of was like, hey, we got to
[57:21.410 --> 57:23.330]  get some some traps going
[57:23.330 --> 57:25.490]  here to keep these things safe.
[57:25.490 --> 57:27.250]  And, you know, we
[57:27.250 --> 57:28.010]  ended up getting on.
[57:28.010 --> 57:29.330]  But there's still there's a lot of
[57:29.330 --> 57:30.290]  wildlife there.
[57:30.290 --> 57:32.570]  There's a there's a barn right by.
[57:32.570 --> 57:34.490]  So, you know, all these mice
[57:34.490 --> 57:35.650]  and rodents had this kind of
[57:35.650 --> 57:37.370]  shelter. There's all bulls and
[57:37.370 --> 57:38.690]  stuff like that.
[57:38.690 --> 57:40.330]  There was birds in the little hoop
[57:40.330 --> 57:41.930]  house where we were propagating.
[57:41.930 --> 57:43.250]  So we lost a good chunk.
[57:43.250 --> 57:45.930]  We lost, I'd say, like
[57:45.930 --> 57:47.970]  almost a third to mice,
[57:47.970 --> 57:49.690]  to damping off, which was really a
[57:49.690 --> 57:52.090]  bummer. And I mean, through those
[57:52.090 --> 57:53.690]  through those kind of mishaps,
[57:53.690 --> 57:55.770]  those super
[57:55.770 --> 57:57.570]  valuable learning experience,
[57:57.570 --> 57:59.450]  you know, going forward, there's
[57:59.450 --> 58:00.610]  going to be traps.
[58:00.610 --> 58:03.050]  I might lay down some wire,
[58:03.050 --> 58:04.530]  some kind of like mesh wire on the
[58:04.530 --> 58:06.330]  ground before, you know, putting
[58:06.330 --> 58:08.250]  the seedlings in so no voles
[58:08.250 --> 58:09.250]  could pop up.
[58:09.970 --> 58:11.890]  Screen cage around around
[58:11.890 --> 58:13.530]  the greenhouses so birds can get
[58:13.530 --> 58:15.370]  it can't get in, but arrow can.
[58:15.810 --> 58:17.610]  But so, yeah, it was really we lost
[58:17.610 --> 58:19.090]  a good chunk.
[58:19.090 --> 58:21.050]  But as far as I mean, running that
[58:21.050 --> 58:22.930]  population size, there was some
[58:22.930 --> 58:25.370]  some interesting expression.
[58:25.370 --> 58:26.370]  There was some
[58:27.490 --> 58:29.450]  some fasciation, which is
[58:29.450 --> 58:30.890]  called cresting. A lot of times
[58:30.890 --> 58:32.690]  where the buds instead of,
[58:32.690 --> 58:34.530]  you know, being kind of what's
[58:34.530 --> 58:36.410]  considered normal, they have this
[58:36.410 --> 58:38.970]  kind of elongated, like,
[58:38.970 --> 58:41.730]  you know, crested look to them.
[58:41.730 --> 58:43.450]  So there was some of that going on.
[58:43.450 --> 58:45.370]  Some variegation, you know, where
[58:45.370 --> 58:47.010]  you kind of get that like split
[58:47.010 --> 58:49.130]  leaf where there'll be like a yellow
[58:49.130 --> 58:50.690]  a leaf that's half yellow, half
[58:50.690 --> 58:52.890]  green, which we saw.
[58:52.890 --> 58:53.890]  I saw, you know,
[58:54.970 --> 58:57.050]  probably like 20 plants or so
[58:57.050 --> 58:59.050]  out of the three thousand that we
[58:59.050 --> 59:01.410]  ended up planting and keeping.
[59:02.690 --> 59:04.810]  There was a few really special
[59:04.810 --> 59:06.570]  phenotypes that popped up.
[59:06.570 --> 59:07.570]  You know, there was
[59:09.130 --> 59:11.330]  one one particular OG
[59:11.330 --> 59:12.810]  out of the three thousand that we
[59:13.330 --> 59:15.330]  planted. And it was like, oh, gee, I
[59:15.330 --> 59:16.570]  don't know what happened.
[59:16.570 --> 59:18.090]  But this thing, it just had this
[59:18.090 --> 59:20.530]  like citrusy, gassy
[59:20.530 --> 59:22.170]  nose, like nothing else.
[59:22.170 --> 59:24.050]  And I actually as we
[59:24.050 --> 59:26.170]  were, I didn't recognize it or find
[59:26.170 --> 59:27.250]  it in the field.
[59:27.250 --> 59:29.210]  But once we harvested, we're in this
[59:29.210 --> 59:31.410]  dark kind of like, you know, not
[59:31.410 --> 59:32.970]  really well lit area.
[59:32.970 --> 59:34.050]  And I picked up the plant.
[59:34.050 --> 59:36.130]  I'm like, what the fuck is this?
[59:36.130 --> 59:37.530]  And I smelled it and I was like, oh,
[59:37.530 --> 59:38.850]  I got to put this aside like
[59:38.850 --> 59:39.890]  somewhere.
[59:39.890 --> 59:41.370]  And it was just hectic.
[59:41.730 --> 59:43.530]  But it just never, you know, never
[59:43.530 --> 59:44.650]  got tended to.
[59:44.650 --> 59:46.170]  And then as we were taking things
[59:46.170 --> 59:47.770]  down into the bins, my friend is
[59:47.770 --> 59:49.610]  like, what is this?
[59:49.610 --> 59:50.690]  Like, what the fuck is this?
[59:50.690 --> 59:51.730]  And I'm like, let me see.
[59:51.730 --> 59:52.770]  And I kind of push them out of the
[59:52.770 --> 59:54.290]  way and I go over and I grab them
[59:54.290 --> 59:55.570]  like that's the plant, like that's
[59:55.570 --> 59:57.210]  the one. So now, you know, that's
[59:57.210 --> 59:58.650]  kind of my one of my headstaff
[59:58.650 --> 01:00:00.450]  plants. And there was, you know,
[01:00:00.450 --> 01:00:01.610]  just a really
[01:00:03.010 --> 01:00:04.810]  there was this one OG that also had
[01:00:04.810 --> 01:00:06.610]  it was a run. It did not grow very
[01:00:06.610 --> 01:00:08.610]  well, but it had this really narrow
[01:00:08.610 --> 01:00:10.570]  leaf, you know, classic,
[01:00:10.570 --> 01:00:11.930]  you know, what you consider like a
[01:00:11.930 --> 01:00:14.330]  sativa leaf expression.
[01:00:14.330 --> 01:00:16.090]  And I thought that was super cool.
[01:00:16.090 --> 01:00:17.050]  And, you know, there was a
[01:00:17.050 --> 01:00:18.570]  lemongrass, you know, that
[01:00:20.210 --> 01:00:21.490]  the lemongrass is like
[01:00:22.650 --> 01:00:24.650]  some kind of lemon, you know,
[01:00:24.650 --> 01:00:26.370]  haze or something like that, crossed
[01:00:26.370 --> 01:00:29.170]  with a humble gelato.
[01:00:29.170 --> 01:00:31.290]  And this one particular phenol
[01:00:31.290 --> 01:00:33.290]  and there's probably like three
[01:00:33.290 --> 01:00:35.610]  or four plants out of the thousand
[01:00:35.610 --> 01:00:37.610]  that we had in there that
[01:00:37.610 --> 01:00:39.410]  just smelled just like Girl Scout
[01:00:39.410 --> 01:00:42.010]  Cookie. And Girl Scout Cookie is,
[01:00:42.010 --> 01:00:44.450]  you know, gelato, one of its
[01:00:44.450 --> 01:00:46.690]  its parents,
[01:00:46.690 --> 01:00:48.610]  you know, it's probably its mom.
[01:00:50.090 --> 01:00:51.890]  So, yeah, it had this really unique
[01:00:51.890 --> 01:00:53.730]  expression where it just inherited
[01:00:53.730 --> 01:00:55.410]  almost it was just like its
[01:00:55.410 --> 01:00:56.850]  grandparent.
[01:00:56.850 --> 01:00:58.810]  And I, you know, I found that one
[01:00:58.810 --> 01:01:00.290]  plant and I was like, oh, my God,
[01:01:00.290 --> 01:01:02.210]  like I haven't smelled cannabis
[01:01:02.210 --> 01:01:04.170]  like this and in like
[01:01:04.170 --> 01:01:05.290]  five years.
[01:01:05.290 --> 01:01:06.890]  And I was really excited to see that.
[01:01:06.890 --> 01:01:08.970]  So running such a large population
[01:01:08.970 --> 01:01:10.930]  size was really a treat,
[01:01:10.930 --> 01:01:12.730]  you know, because I love I love the
[01:01:12.730 --> 01:01:14.570]  plant. I love watching it do its
[01:01:14.570 --> 01:01:15.330]  thing.
[01:01:15.330 --> 01:01:17.330]  And, you know, running clones, you're
[01:01:17.330 --> 01:01:19.050]  not going to have that really unless
[01:01:19.050 --> 01:01:20.890]  you're growing a different cultivar.
[01:01:20.890 --> 01:01:23.450]  So getting to see that expression
[01:01:23.450 --> 01:01:25.890]  was really special.
[01:01:25.890 --> 01:01:27.330]  Hey, I got a question for you.
[01:01:27.330 --> 01:01:29.210]  Like that special plant
[01:01:29.210 --> 01:01:30.650]  after you took it down, could you
[01:01:30.650 --> 01:01:32.890]  still clip it and try to clone it
[01:01:32.890 --> 01:01:35.610]  or is it too late once it's
[01:01:35.610 --> 01:01:36.130]  gone?
[01:01:36.130 --> 01:01:38.130]  Because it was all it
[01:01:38.130 --> 01:01:40.130]  got like harvested from the
[01:01:40.130 --> 01:01:41.810]  field and you're just cutting full
[01:01:41.810 --> 01:01:42.650]  plants.
[01:01:42.650 --> 01:01:44.090]  You know, we weren't pulling the
[01:01:44.090 --> 01:01:45.650]  roots up because they were so
[01:01:45.650 --> 01:01:47.570]  anchored down, but we were cutting
[01:01:47.570 --> 01:01:48.370]  right at the base.
[01:01:48.370 --> 01:01:49.370]  So
[01:01:50.770 --> 01:01:52.770]  I it's those are those are
[01:01:52.770 --> 01:01:54.530]  gone. There's a few in the field.
[01:01:54.530 --> 01:01:56.090]  But next year, if I find a special
[01:01:56.090 --> 01:01:58.250]  plant, it is going to be something
[01:01:58.250 --> 01:01:59.490]  I do where I'm going to be
[01:02:00.850 --> 01:02:02.850]  harvesting, you know, like
[01:02:02.850 --> 01:02:04.610]  most of the plant, but leaving a few
[01:02:04.610 --> 01:02:06.770]  branches and trying to
[01:02:07.290 --> 01:02:09.210]  take some clones of it because,
[01:02:09.210 --> 01:02:10.810]  yeah, it is a bummer, you know,
[01:02:10.810 --> 01:02:12.730]  having this like really amazing
[01:02:12.730 --> 01:02:14.730]  special, you know, one out of a
[01:02:14.730 --> 01:02:16.690]  thousand plants come up and that's
[01:02:16.690 --> 01:02:17.890]  like, well, it's gone
[01:02:19.210 --> 01:02:20.850]  and finding that again, it's going
[01:02:20.850 --> 01:02:22.770]  to, you know, it's like
[01:02:22.770 --> 01:02:24.010]  I said, one out of a thousand.
[01:02:25.970 --> 01:02:28.010]  So but yeah, next year, if I find
[01:02:28.010 --> 01:02:29.530]  any keepers, I'm marking it.
[01:02:29.530 --> 01:02:31.410]  I'm I'm going to tell everybody who's
[01:02:31.410 --> 01:02:33.250]  working there, like, don't cut this,
[01:02:33.250 --> 01:02:35.290]  like don't do it just
[01:02:35.290 --> 01:02:36.850]  so. Yeah, I can try to take a
[01:02:36.850 --> 01:02:37.850]  cutting and re-badging.
[01:02:39.010 --> 01:02:40.610]  I didn't want to interrupt your flow
[01:02:40.610 --> 01:02:41.610]  there, but there was something that I
[01:02:41.610 --> 01:02:42.970]  was hoping we could talk about, and
[01:02:42.970 --> 01:02:44.890]  that was like beneficials at more of
[01:02:44.890 --> 01:02:46.890]  like the larger farm scale
[01:02:46.890 --> 01:02:48.770]  level. Like I had I had heard
[01:02:48.770 --> 01:02:50.130]  from friends and peers that, you
[01:02:50.130 --> 01:02:51.490]  know, if there is a barn, then you
[01:02:51.490 --> 01:02:52.490]  get barn cats.
[01:02:53.330 --> 01:02:55.010]  You know, if there's issues, then you
[01:02:55.010 --> 01:02:56.490]  get a donkey because that's kind of
[01:02:56.490 --> 01:02:58.050]  like almost like a guard dog, if you
[01:02:58.050 --> 01:03:00.570]  will, for for a variety of reasons.
[01:03:00.570 --> 01:03:01.730]  I've personally never done that
[01:03:01.730 --> 01:03:03.330]  before. I was wondering if you'd
[01:03:03.330 --> 01:03:05.290]  ever seen some
[01:03:05.290 --> 01:03:07.730]  some real guidance to that on
[01:03:07.730 --> 01:03:09.250]  making sure that there's barn cats
[01:03:09.250 --> 01:03:10.770]  running around killing all of those
[01:03:10.770 --> 01:03:12.530]  rodents for you and kind of taking
[01:03:12.530 --> 01:03:15.050]  the beneficials to the next level
[01:03:15.050 --> 01:03:16.930]  as you continue farming at the next
[01:03:16.930 --> 01:03:17.930]  level.
[01:03:18.530 --> 01:03:20.650]  Yeah, so we actually just inherited
[01:03:21.690 --> 01:03:22.690]  a barn cat.
[01:03:23.450 --> 01:03:25.930]  There is an RV park in front of the
[01:03:25.930 --> 01:03:28.290]  kind of in front of where I farm.
[01:03:28.290 --> 01:03:30.410]  And this couple had a
[01:03:30.410 --> 01:03:32.450]  cat with them and the cat jumped
[01:03:32.450 --> 01:03:33.250]  out of the window.
[01:03:33.250 --> 01:03:34.810]  They looked for it, stayed for a few
[01:03:34.810 --> 01:03:36.970]  extra days and eventually
[01:03:36.970 --> 01:03:38.770]  they're like, well, like
[01:03:39.010 --> 01:03:40.890]  we got to go, which is a super
[01:03:40.890 --> 01:03:41.890]  bummer for them.
[01:03:42.210 --> 01:03:44.290]  But now the cats just kind of running
[01:03:44.290 --> 01:03:45.890]  around, hanging out in the barn.
[01:03:47.050 --> 01:03:49.090]  It's looking pretty plump.
[01:03:49.250 --> 01:03:50.530]  It doesn't look like it's going
[01:03:50.530 --> 01:03:52.690]  hungry. So I'm taking that as a good
[01:03:52.690 --> 01:03:55.290]  sign, you know, assuming
[01:03:55.490 --> 01:03:56.930]  there are some predators.
[01:03:56.930 --> 01:03:58.250]  Me and my friend, I mean, there's
[01:03:58.250 --> 01:03:59.370]  there's a bear that was running
[01:03:59.370 --> 01:04:00.650]  around eating the corn.
[01:04:01.170 --> 01:04:02.810]  There is me and my buddy saw
[01:04:02.810 --> 01:04:04.690]  a bobcat one day hanging out by
[01:04:04.690 --> 01:04:05.690]  the river.
[01:04:07.090 --> 01:04:08.370]  So there are predators
[01:04:09.130 --> 01:04:10.330]  kind of doing their thing.
[01:04:10.730 --> 01:04:12.490]  But also, yeah, now we have a barn
[01:04:12.490 --> 01:04:13.330]  cat.
[01:04:13.330 --> 01:04:15.330]  And that was something
[01:04:15.330 --> 01:04:17.210]  that as that was happening, as
[01:04:17.210 --> 01:04:19.290]  those those mice were kind of taking
[01:04:19.290 --> 01:04:20.930]  out plants, I'm like, I just need to
[01:04:20.930 --> 01:04:21.930]  go find a cat.
[01:04:21.930 --> 01:04:23.490]  Like, I got to get a cat.
[01:04:23.490 --> 01:04:25.290]  So now we have one.
[01:04:26.490 --> 01:04:27.850]  But I don't think it would be a bad
[01:04:27.850 --> 01:04:29.650]  idea to, you know, have
[01:04:29.770 --> 01:04:31.010]  we have some some extra
[01:04:31.330 --> 01:04:32.850]  cats around because, yeah, I mean,
[01:04:32.850 --> 01:04:34.570]  the mice really did a number in the
[01:04:34.570 --> 01:04:35.570]  voles.
[01:04:36.930 --> 01:04:38.330]  You know, back back when I was
[01:04:38.330 --> 01:04:40.210]  living on that one property with
[01:04:40.210 --> 01:04:41.970]  the salt grown white depths,
[01:04:42.290 --> 01:04:43.890]  my dog, I would take my dog
[01:04:44.810 --> 01:04:46.530]  to pull tarps with me and my
[01:04:46.530 --> 01:04:48.130]  dog is a hell of a mouser.
[01:04:49.330 --> 01:04:51.330]  He would he would catch mice
[01:04:51.370 --> 01:04:52.810]  run under the trellis netting, catch
[01:04:52.810 --> 01:04:55.090]  mice, take out voles,
[01:04:55.090 --> 01:04:56.090]  sniff them out.
[01:04:56.690 --> 01:04:58.130]  They love to hang out in light
[01:04:58.170 --> 01:04:59.170]  depth.
[01:04:59.210 --> 01:05:00.810]  It's like a nice shelter for him.
[01:05:00.810 --> 01:05:02.330]  It keeps him cool during the day,
[01:05:02.690 --> 01:05:03.970]  you know, and then we're disturbing
[01:05:03.970 --> 01:05:05.250]  it at night and you'd always see,
[01:05:05.250 --> 01:05:07.050]  you know, a bunch of mice right now.
[01:05:07.490 --> 01:05:09.050]  So, yeah, my dog, he would kind of
[01:05:09.050 --> 01:05:10.850]  come in and do some
[01:05:11.170 --> 01:05:12.170]  some work with me.
[01:05:13.530 --> 01:05:15.090]  So, yeah, I'm totally on board with
[01:05:15.090 --> 01:05:17.090]  that. Getting a cat would be
[01:05:17.330 --> 01:05:18.850]  another cat even would be huge
[01:05:18.890 --> 01:05:20.690]  because cats just that's their
[01:05:21.010 --> 01:05:22.010]  that's what they do.
[01:05:22.210 --> 01:05:23.890]  They just love to just run around
[01:05:23.890 --> 01:05:25.770]  and do population control for
[01:05:25.770 --> 01:05:26.770]  you.
[01:05:26.810 --> 01:05:28.290]  And it seems like the chickens,
[01:05:28.850 --> 01:05:29.850]  sorry.
[01:05:29.930 --> 01:05:30.930]  Yeah.
[01:05:30.930 --> 01:05:33.050]  I just want one more little
[01:05:33.530 --> 01:05:35.090]  nugget about cats is that they're
[01:05:35.090 --> 01:05:36.090]  nocturnal, too.
[01:05:36.530 --> 01:05:38.290]  So that they're if you have a dog
[01:05:38.290 --> 01:05:40.370]  during the day and a cat at night,
[01:05:40.410 --> 01:05:41.930]  you're you're getting both sides of
[01:05:41.930 --> 01:05:43.530]  the spectrum taken care of.
[01:05:44.250 --> 01:05:45.810]  And there's a breed called the Maine
[01:05:45.810 --> 01:05:46.810]  Coon Cats.
[01:05:47.130 --> 01:05:48.290]  All right. Some of them get as big as
[01:05:48.290 --> 01:05:49.730]  twenty eight fucking pounds.
[01:05:49.810 --> 01:05:51.570]  I mean, imagine that it's like
[01:05:51.570 --> 01:05:53.010]  a fucking midsize dog.
[01:05:53.970 --> 01:05:55.490]  Highly, highly, highly
[01:05:55.730 --> 01:05:57.530]  highly, highly active is, you know,
[01:05:57.530 --> 01:05:59.290]  they've got wicked good instincts as
[01:05:59.290 --> 01:06:01.170]  far as mousing and hunting and
[01:06:01.170 --> 01:06:02.130]  they're big enough that they can
[01:06:02.130 --> 01:06:03.410]  protect themselves against some of
[01:06:03.410 --> 01:06:04.410]  those other predators.
[01:06:04.410 --> 01:06:06.290]  You know that that if they you know,
[01:06:06.690 --> 01:06:08.170]  they can run as fast and they can
[01:06:08.170 --> 01:06:09.170]  climb as fast.
[01:06:09.410 --> 01:06:11.010]  They've got a better shot than a
[01:06:11.010 --> 01:06:12.010]  little domestic cat.
[01:06:12.050 --> 01:06:13.490]  So just keep that breed in mind if
[01:06:13.490 --> 01:06:14.650]  you're going to go there. But that
[01:06:14.650 --> 01:06:16.690]  combination of cat and dog
[01:06:17.010 --> 01:06:18.370]  big time, that'll really help with
[01:06:18.370 --> 01:06:19.370]  those rodent controls.
[01:06:19.530 --> 01:06:20.770]  All right, Brian. Sorry about that.
[01:06:21.210 --> 01:06:22.370]  Yeah, no, that's excellent.
[01:06:22.450 --> 01:06:23.770]  And I had heard if you want to try
[01:06:23.770 --> 01:06:25.210]  to keep things cleaner,
[01:06:25.650 --> 01:06:26.890]  so that the rodents aren't running
[01:06:26.890 --> 01:06:28.490]  around, then that's another reason
[01:06:28.730 --> 01:06:29.570]  why you get chickens.
[01:06:29.570 --> 01:06:30.810]  You know, obviously they're providing
[01:06:30.970 --> 01:06:32.130]  eggs and then
[01:06:32.770 --> 01:06:33.730]  from what I understand, just
[01:06:33.730 --> 01:06:35.170]  constantly eating, eating and
[01:06:35.450 --> 01:06:36.450]  pooping kind of thing.
[01:06:37.090 --> 01:06:38.410]  Have you ever messed around with
[01:06:38.410 --> 01:06:39.210]  donkeys and stuff?
[01:06:39.210 --> 01:06:40.770]  Do you ever have deer or anything
[01:06:40.770 --> 01:06:42.210]  that's running through eating your
[01:06:42.250 --> 01:06:43.890]  eating your crops and humble?
[01:06:45.090 --> 01:06:46.850]  So, yeah, deer, once
[01:06:46.850 --> 01:06:48.210]  you get in the flower, they're not
[01:06:48.210 --> 01:06:49.730]  really a big issue.
[01:06:50.770 --> 01:06:52.290]  They don't really prefer to have
[01:06:52.650 --> 01:06:53.610]  the buds, but they will.
[01:06:53.610 --> 01:06:54.690]  They'll come and nibble on the
[01:06:54.690 --> 01:06:56.370]  leaves and it gets dry there.
[01:06:56.730 --> 01:06:58.370]  So there's a lot, you know, a lot of
[01:06:58.370 --> 01:07:00.450]  places you're growing
[01:07:00.450 --> 01:07:02.090]  in this golden field and there's
[01:07:02.090 --> 01:07:03.610]  just an oasis of green.
[01:07:03.890 --> 01:07:06.170]  And, you know, they gravitate
[01:07:06.170 --> 01:07:07.490]  towards it. They're not the only
[01:07:07.490 --> 01:07:09.410]  pest that will gravitate towards
[01:07:09.410 --> 01:07:10.410]  that oasis of green.
[01:07:10.770 --> 01:07:12.610]  But, yeah, so they will come around.
[01:07:13.930 --> 01:07:15.890]  This year we had a deer fence,
[01:07:15.890 --> 01:07:17.490]  but, you know, deer will do whatever
[01:07:17.490 --> 01:07:18.810]  that whatever they want.
[01:07:18.850 --> 01:07:20.210]  They know they were jumping clear in
[01:07:20.210 --> 01:07:21.250]  this eight foot fence.
[01:07:22.010 --> 01:07:22.810]  No problem.
[01:07:22.810 --> 01:07:24.050]  I mean, I saw one of them kind of
[01:07:24.370 --> 01:07:25.930]  have a little issue getting over,
[01:07:25.930 --> 01:07:27.730]  but he took the fence down a
[01:07:27.730 --> 01:07:28.730]  little bit.
[01:07:28.730 --> 01:07:30.450]  He jumped, got stuck, took it down.
[01:07:30.610 --> 01:07:32.130]  I watched one jump through the
[01:07:32.130 --> 01:07:33.130]  fence.
[01:07:33.410 --> 01:07:34.970]  My buddy and it's a bummer.
[01:07:34.970 --> 01:07:36.850]  My buddy actually got caught
[01:07:36.850 --> 01:07:38.770]  in the fence and my buddy went
[01:07:38.770 --> 01:07:39.770]  over and untangled
[01:07:40.650 --> 01:07:42.530]  this deer as it was was
[01:07:42.530 --> 01:07:43.970]  panicking. So that's something that
[01:07:43.970 --> 01:07:45.730]  it's really like a bummer for me to
[01:07:45.730 --> 01:07:46.730]  see.
[01:07:47.130 --> 01:07:48.530]  And it's also like a dangerous
[01:07:48.530 --> 01:07:50.450]  situation to be in as a human, like
[01:07:50.450 --> 01:07:52.490]  going and trying to save save a deer
[01:07:52.490 --> 01:07:53.490]  from fencing.
[01:07:53.730 --> 01:07:55.850]  So this spot in particular, it's not
[01:07:56.250 --> 01:07:56.970]  ours.
[01:07:56.970 --> 01:07:57.970]  And like, but
[01:07:58.850 --> 01:08:00.930]  in the future, like I'm all about
[01:08:00.930 --> 01:08:02.210]  like having kind of that.
[01:08:03.810 --> 01:08:05.530]  That kind of whole closed loop where
[01:08:05.530 --> 01:08:07.410]  you have farm animals who are taking
[01:08:07.410 --> 01:08:09.450]  care of things in the offseason,
[01:08:09.450 --> 01:08:11.490]  they're going to be kind of grazing
[01:08:11.490 --> 01:08:13.610]  and deposit in basically,
[01:08:14.010 --> 01:08:16.170]  you know, composting on the spot
[01:08:16.370 --> 01:08:17.770]  and fertilizing your field.
[01:08:17.770 --> 01:08:19.050]  I think that's something that a lot
[01:08:19.050 --> 01:08:21.130]  of agriculture is missing
[01:08:21.130 --> 01:08:23.130]  nowadays is that closed loop.
[01:08:24.130 --> 01:08:26.050]  And there are other farmers who
[01:08:26.050 --> 01:08:27.130]  are, you know, they'll have their
[01:08:27.130 --> 01:08:29.130]  cows graze and then they'll
[01:08:29.210 --> 01:08:30.130]  do their planting.
[01:08:30.130 --> 01:08:31.490]  But it's really rare in the
[01:08:32.050 --> 01:08:34.050]  cannabis community to have that kind
[01:08:34.050 --> 01:08:35.410]  of closed loop where you're
[01:08:35.410 --> 01:08:37.090]  incorporating animals, which I feel
[01:08:37.090 --> 01:08:38.970]  like is an essential part
[01:08:38.970 --> 01:08:39.970]  of agriculture.
[01:08:40.010 --> 01:08:41.210]  And it's something that in Korean
[01:08:41.210 --> 01:08:42.690]  natural farming, a lot of people
[01:08:42.690 --> 01:08:44.690]  don't realize that Master
[01:08:44.690 --> 01:08:46.410]  Cho, he was
[01:08:46.890 --> 01:08:48.850]  really largely into rearing
[01:08:49.170 --> 01:08:51.810]  chickens and pigs
[01:08:52.050 --> 01:08:53.770]  almost more so than plants.
[01:08:54.290 --> 01:08:56.290]  And he incorporated those into
[01:08:56.290 --> 01:08:58.210]  his system. And without them there,
[01:08:58.570 --> 01:09:00.130]  you're definitely lacking something,
[01:09:00.210 --> 01:09:02.690]  I feel. So in the future, I'm totally
[01:09:02.690 --> 01:09:04.570]  like I want to have a
[01:09:04.570 --> 01:09:06.410]  closed loop, incorporate animals into
[01:09:06.410 --> 01:09:07.410]  the system.
[01:09:07.850 --> 01:09:09.650]  But as of now, it's just we're doing
[01:09:09.650 --> 01:09:12.450]  the standard, you know, deer fencing
[01:09:12.890 --> 01:09:14.770]  and just kind of hoping for
[01:09:14.770 --> 01:09:15.770]  the best.
[01:09:15.890 --> 01:09:17.530]  It does a good job keeping most of
[01:09:17.530 --> 01:09:19.610]  them out. And we are lucky because
[01:09:19.610 --> 01:09:21.490]  we have 20 acres of corn.
[01:09:21.810 --> 01:09:23.530]  Surrounding the field.
[01:09:23.530 --> 01:09:25.490]  So I feel like others, it's
[01:09:25.490 --> 01:09:28.050]  a more more enticing
[01:09:28.050 --> 01:09:29.850]  option for them as opposed to, you
[01:09:29.850 --> 01:09:32.050]  know, this fragrant flower that,
[01:09:32.290 --> 01:09:33.890]  you know, doesn't particularly taste
[01:09:33.890 --> 01:09:36.130]  good to deer.
[01:09:36.970 --> 01:09:38.130]  So we got lucky on that.
[01:09:38.170 --> 01:09:39.690]  And it was really, you know, even the
[01:09:39.690 --> 01:09:41.570]  pest issues. I feel like the pests
[01:09:41.570 --> 01:09:43.610]  that we had were kind
[01:09:43.610 --> 01:09:45.250]  of more concerned with the
[01:09:45.410 --> 01:09:46.410]  with the corn.
[01:09:46.770 --> 01:09:48.690]  They kind of left the field alone.
[01:09:48.730 --> 01:09:50.730]  We had a little issues
[01:09:50.730 --> 01:09:52.090]  here and there, but they just
[01:09:52.090 --> 01:09:53.770]  handled themselves and they never got
[01:09:53.770 --> 01:09:54.770]  out of control.
[01:09:55.570 --> 01:09:56.930]  So even though it was a big field of
[01:09:56.930 --> 01:09:58.490]  cannabis, we weren't really
[01:09:59.210 --> 01:10:00.650]  monocropping per se.
[01:10:00.890 --> 01:10:02.770]  You know, there was there
[01:10:02.770 --> 01:10:04.610]  was, you know, a cover crop
[01:10:04.610 --> 01:10:05.530]  at one point in time.
[01:10:05.530 --> 01:10:07.490]  There's a blackberry
[01:10:07.490 --> 01:10:09.530]  bramble. There's fruit trees over
[01:10:09.810 --> 01:10:10.810]  yonder in the corn.
[01:10:10.850 --> 01:10:12.730]  So I think that really kind
[01:10:12.730 --> 01:10:14.370]  of helped a whole bunch as well.
[01:10:14.530 --> 01:10:15.970]  As far as the corn farmer is a
[01:10:15.970 --> 01:10:17.490]  Mennonite, you had mentioned.
[01:10:18.090 --> 01:10:19.290]  Yep. So they don't believe in
[01:10:19.290 --> 01:10:20.290]  non-generic.
[01:10:20.530 --> 01:10:22.090]  So I'd imagine that corn is pretty
[01:10:22.090 --> 01:10:23.890]  rare in the fact that it's non-GMO
[01:10:23.890 --> 01:10:24.490]  and.
[01:10:24.490 --> 01:10:25.490]  Yep. 100 percent.
[01:10:25.610 --> 01:10:27.490]  Yeah. They try to go as organic as
[01:10:27.490 --> 01:10:28.490]  possible.
[01:10:28.970 --> 01:10:30.530]  There's a little trick on deer.
[01:10:31.970 --> 01:10:33.170]  I've used this for other people
[01:10:33.410 --> 01:10:34.890]  consulting in cannabis grows, and
[01:10:34.890 --> 01:10:36.890]  that is to grow some plants outside
[01:10:36.890 --> 01:10:38.930]  the fence. And by the way, they love
[01:10:38.970 --> 01:10:39.970]  blue dream.
[01:10:42.250 --> 01:10:43.610]  It's called the trap plant.
[01:10:43.650 --> 01:10:45.130]  Right. You give them what they want
[01:10:45.130 --> 01:10:46.290]  so they don't try to get over the
[01:10:46.290 --> 01:10:47.850]  fence and give them something that
[01:10:47.850 --> 01:10:48.850]  they really love.
[01:10:49.010 --> 01:10:50.810]  And for whatever reason, that's blue
[01:10:50.810 --> 01:10:51.810]  dream.
[01:10:52.970 --> 01:10:54.090]  Well, that's good because the market
[01:10:54.090 --> 01:10:54.970]  really doesn't love it.
[01:10:54.970 --> 01:10:55.970]  So here
[01:10:57.010 --> 01:10:58.010]  you go.
[01:10:59.530 --> 01:11:00.850]  Well, I feel like there are too many
[01:11:00.850 --> 01:11:02.570]  fugazi blue dreams out there.
[01:11:02.610 --> 01:11:03.610]  So everybody never
[01:11:04.530 --> 01:11:06.530]  really got to experience a true
[01:11:06.530 --> 01:11:07.530]  version of that.
[01:11:08.370 --> 01:11:10.370]  I'd always heard if you guys know,
[01:11:10.610 --> 01:11:12.490]  supposedly blue dreams was clone only
[01:11:12.490 --> 01:11:14.570]  and it came from a medicinal
[01:11:14.570 --> 01:11:15.410]  facility.
[01:11:15.410 --> 01:11:17.050]  Is there any truth to that or is that
[01:11:17.050 --> 01:11:18.050]  just the word?
[01:11:19.850 --> 01:11:20.850]  I've never seen
[01:11:22.170 --> 01:11:24.410]  reputable seed companies
[01:11:24.410 --> 01:11:26.090]  saying they had blue dream.
[01:11:26.370 --> 01:11:28.370]  And yeah, I think it is clone
[01:11:28.370 --> 01:11:30.810]  only as far as its origins.
[01:11:31.050 --> 01:11:32.250]  I'm not sure.
[01:11:32.690 --> 01:11:34.450]  I feel like that's kind of shrouded in
[01:11:34.450 --> 01:11:36.610]  some mystery. But yeah, I've
[01:11:36.610 --> 01:11:38.370]  definitely heard clone only if you're
[01:11:38.370 --> 01:11:39.850]  seeing someone selling blue dream
[01:11:39.850 --> 01:11:41.850]  seeds. It's either like a
[01:11:41.850 --> 01:11:44.210]  self plant that they're
[01:11:44.210 --> 01:11:46.050]  reversing and then
[01:11:46.290 --> 01:11:47.690]  pollinating another blue dream.
[01:11:47.690 --> 01:11:49.370]  But it's not going to be the same.
[01:11:49.450 --> 01:11:50.570]  It's not going to be the same as the
[01:11:50.570 --> 01:11:51.570]  cut was.
[01:11:54.250 --> 01:11:55.530]  Do people still have the cut?
[01:11:57.330 --> 01:11:58.810]  I'm sure somebody does.
[01:12:00.050 --> 01:12:02.170]  I can't imagine people letting
[01:12:02.170 --> 01:12:04.330]  that one go. That plant in particular
[01:12:04.330 --> 01:12:06.490]  cultivar made a lot of people a lot
[01:12:06.490 --> 01:12:07.770]  of money over the years.
[01:12:08.890 --> 01:12:10.570]  And it seems like it's recycled at
[01:12:10.570 --> 01:12:12.770]  newers when new states open
[01:12:12.770 --> 01:12:13.770]  up.
[01:12:13.770 --> 01:12:15.450]  People want blue dreams because it's
[01:12:15.450 --> 01:12:16.410]  like something that they've heard
[01:12:16.410 --> 01:12:17.770]  about and then it fizzles out.
[01:12:19.130 --> 01:12:20.130]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:12:20.130 --> 01:12:22.370]  It was huge in New York before
[01:12:22.370 --> 01:12:24.490]  I left to California about eight
[01:12:24.490 --> 01:12:25.490]  years ago.
[01:12:25.730 --> 01:12:27.050]  It was everybody loved it.
[01:12:27.090 --> 01:12:28.850]  You know, it was super popular.
[01:12:28.850 --> 01:12:30.410]  People would ask for it by name.
[01:12:30.690 --> 01:12:33.170]  Even the average smoker
[01:12:33.170 --> 01:12:35.330]  would be able to smell it and pick
[01:12:35.330 --> 01:12:36.530]  it out of a lineup and be like, oh,
[01:12:36.530 --> 01:12:37.530]  that's blue dream.
[01:12:39.090 --> 01:12:41.290]  Yeah, blue dream had a really unique
[01:12:42.370 --> 01:12:44.050]  high to it. It was it was really
[01:12:44.050 --> 01:12:45.050]  special.
[01:12:45.170 --> 01:12:46.330]  It was uplifting.
[01:12:46.330 --> 01:12:47.330]  It didn't like maybe.
[01:12:49.250 --> 01:12:50.410]  I was going to say maybe we could
[01:12:50.410 --> 01:12:51.330]  ask St.
[01:12:51.330 --> 01:12:52.330]  Observation.
[01:12:55.410 --> 01:12:57.130]  You know, from what I understood,
[01:12:57.370 --> 01:12:58.850]  it came from a lab and it was made
[01:12:58.850 --> 01:13:00.810]  for people that suffered from ADHD.
[01:13:02.250 --> 01:13:03.490]  So I don't know if there's any merit
[01:13:03.490 --> 01:13:04.690]  to that as well, but supposedly it
[01:13:04.690 --> 01:13:06.410]  was actually bred as a real medicine.
[01:13:07.810 --> 01:13:10.010]  Yeah, PTSD, like a variety
[01:13:10.010 --> 01:13:11.930]  of different things, and I felt
[01:13:11.930 --> 01:13:12.930]  like really.
[01:13:13.170 --> 01:13:14.170]  Now, go ahead.
[01:13:14.930 --> 01:13:16.850]  I'm just going to say I was given
[01:13:16.850 --> 01:13:18.450]  Adderall, Johnny, when I was
[01:13:18.650 --> 01:13:20.530]  young, I think I was a sophomore or
[01:13:20.530 --> 01:13:21.890]  maybe a junior when I was in high
[01:13:21.890 --> 01:13:23.770]  school. And I personally felt like
[01:13:23.770 --> 01:13:25.970]  I started to see that I was changing,
[01:13:25.970 --> 01:13:27.650]  like just me as
[01:13:27.730 --> 01:13:29.210]  my own personality.
[01:13:29.210 --> 01:13:30.850]  Like I just felt more of like a
[01:13:30.850 --> 01:13:32.810]  robot, like, you know, you take
[01:13:32.810 --> 01:13:34.610]  the pill and then that's just your
[01:13:35.130 --> 01:13:36.370]  kind of become a different person
[01:13:36.370 --> 01:13:38.050]  after months of taking Adderall.
[01:13:38.050 --> 01:13:39.010]  And they were giving me 30
[01:13:39.010 --> 01:13:40.810]  milligrams, which at the time I
[01:13:40.810 --> 01:13:42.370]  felt like was really hard to handle.
[01:13:42.970 --> 01:13:44.050]  So that's when I really started to
[01:13:44.050 --> 01:13:45.930]  get into cannabis is when I
[01:13:45.930 --> 01:13:47.810]  learned about Blue Dreams in high
[01:13:47.810 --> 01:13:48.850]  school. And then that's where I
[01:13:48.850 --> 01:13:50.370]  really fell in love with cannabis
[01:13:50.370 --> 01:13:52.210]  because I felt like I could I didn't
[01:13:52.210 --> 01:13:53.650]  have access to Blue Dreams or
[01:13:53.650 --> 01:13:55.570]  anything, but I started
[01:13:55.570 --> 01:13:57.010]  smoking cannabis more and I felt
[01:13:57.010 --> 01:13:58.610]  like that was more like, wow, this
[01:13:58.610 --> 01:13:59.530]  shit really is kind of like
[01:13:59.530 --> 01:14:00.690]  medicine. But everybody in the
[01:14:00.690 --> 01:14:01.970]  South, especially at that time in
[01:14:01.970 --> 01:14:03.730]  Georgia, if you smoked weed, you're
[01:14:03.730 --> 01:14:05.810]  kind of like automatically a loser
[01:14:05.810 --> 01:14:07.010]  burnout, you know.
[01:14:07.570 --> 01:14:09.210]  So it was it was really kind of a
[01:14:09.210 --> 01:14:11.170]  weird stigma to know that
[01:14:11.170 --> 01:14:12.570]  this is medicine, but at the same
[01:14:12.570 --> 01:14:13.690]  time, everybody around you,
[01:14:13.690 --> 01:14:15.010]  including your family, is telling
[01:14:15.010 --> 01:14:16.130]  you like, yo, you should just be on
[01:14:16.130 --> 01:14:17.130]  that Adderall.
[01:14:18.290 --> 01:14:19.930]  Yeah, it's really sad that they're
[01:14:19.930 --> 01:14:21.250]  pushing that stuff down kids
[01:14:21.250 --> 01:14:23.330]  throats. I mean, it's it's
[01:14:23.330 --> 01:14:25.570]  a hard drug, you know, giving kids
[01:14:25.570 --> 01:14:27.530]  amphetamines, especially at like
[01:14:27.530 --> 01:14:28.970]  a developmental age.
[01:14:29.850 --> 01:14:31.610]  It's really a disservice.
[01:14:31.610 --> 01:14:33.250]  And it's it's sad to see
[01:14:33.890 --> 01:14:35.970]  when there are, you know, way
[01:14:35.970 --> 01:14:36.970]  better options.
[01:14:37.010 --> 01:14:39.090]  And I feel like a lot
[01:14:39.090 --> 01:14:40.930]  of it is it's more
[01:14:40.930 --> 01:14:42.690]  of a symptom of just the
[01:14:42.690 --> 01:14:44.130]  way society is set up.
[01:14:44.810 --> 01:14:46.370]  Oh, you can't pay attention in this
[01:14:46.370 --> 01:14:47.090]  classroom.
[01:14:47.090 --> 01:14:49.010]  It's a they lump everybody in
[01:14:49.010 --> 01:14:50.730]  these these situations and they
[01:14:50.730 --> 01:14:52.650]  expect every every human being
[01:14:52.650 --> 01:14:54.890]  to be able to learn process
[01:14:55.050 --> 01:14:57.170]  at the same rate in the same way.
[01:14:57.450 --> 01:14:58.970]  In reality, it's just that, you
[01:14:58.970 --> 01:15:00.410]  know, that's not the way it works.
[01:15:00.410 --> 01:15:02.570]  Everyone has unique learning style
[01:15:03.730 --> 01:15:05.690]  where where it's really, yeah,
[01:15:05.690 --> 01:15:06.810]  you don't fit the mold.
[01:15:06.810 --> 01:15:08.170]  So here here's something
[01:15:09.010 --> 01:15:11.010]  to kind of to force
[01:15:11.010 --> 01:15:12.170]  you into that mold.
[01:15:12.170 --> 01:15:14.210]  And it really, yeah, it's it's sad
[01:15:14.210 --> 01:15:15.930]  to see that. And I mean, really,
[01:15:15.930 --> 01:15:17.330]  young kids, too, they'll they'll
[01:15:17.330 --> 01:15:18.370]  push that stuff on.
[01:15:18.610 --> 01:15:19.970]  It's like, why does a six year old
[01:15:19.970 --> 01:15:22.250]  need need amphetamine salts?
[01:15:23.610 --> 01:15:25.130]  That's the that's the fucking
[01:15:25.130 --> 01:15:26.450]  pharmaceutical industry.
[01:15:26.490 --> 01:15:28.090]  And I'm not going to go on a ramp,
[01:15:28.090 --> 01:15:29.370]  Peter, but I could.
[01:15:29.370 --> 01:15:30.370]  You fucking know it.
[01:15:32.090 --> 01:15:34.250]  Yeah, I was I was preadder all.
[01:15:34.530 --> 01:15:35.850]  So what they did was they just put
[01:15:35.850 --> 01:15:37.930]  me in a room and said, just figure
[01:15:37.930 --> 01:15:38.930]  something out.
[01:15:42.890 --> 01:15:44.850]  And it's rough, man, I
[01:15:44.850 --> 01:15:46.370]  feel like when you're pushed on
[01:15:46.370 --> 01:15:48.210]  those kind of drugs, it's just.
[01:15:49.210 --> 01:15:50.810]  I don't know, maybe in a way it
[01:15:50.810 --> 01:15:52.050]  may it forced me to start to
[01:15:52.050 --> 01:15:53.850]  research other stuff, and I just
[01:15:53.850 --> 01:15:55.810]  fell in love with cannabis and just
[01:15:56.130 --> 01:15:57.570]  hid from my parents that I was
[01:15:57.570 --> 01:15:58.570]  taking that shit, you know.
[01:15:59.770 --> 01:16:01.410]  So if if other people know about
[01:16:01.410 --> 01:16:03.930]  certain medicinal
[01:16:03.930 --> 01:16:05.530]  strains like Blue Dreams or knows
[01:16:05.530 --> 01:16:06.770]  the real origin of that kind of
[01:16:06.770 --> 01:16:07.890]  stuff, I'd love to know that kind
[01:16:07.890 --> 01:16:09.330]  of stuff, if there was any truth to
[01:16:09.330 --> 01:16:10.330]  that.
[01:16:11.890 --> 01:16:12.890]  And there's a lot of.
[01:16:15.690 --> 01:16:16.770]  There's so many different.
[01:16:16.770 --> 01:16:17.730]  I was going to say every time I've
[01:16:17.730 --> 01:16:18.730]  spoken.
[01:16:19.610 --> 01:16:21.450]  Yeah, that's that's the I
[01:16:21.450 --> 01:16:23.130]  haven't smoked any in a long time.
[01:16:24.370 --> 01:16:26.530]  The cultivars I did smoke
[01:16:26.530 --> 01:16:28.130]  when I got them were were amazing.
[01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:29.250]  It just was a wonderful.
[01:16:29.850 --> 01:16:30.850]  She's very it is.
[01:16:31.290 --> 01:16:32.490]  It's manageable.
[01:16:33.090 --> 01:16:34.090]  So.
[01:16:34.730 --> 01:16:36.490]  It doesn't take you out, it
[01:16:36.690 --> 01:16:38.290]  you can keep your focus.
[01:16:38.730 --> 01:16:40.290]  Yeah. Like you said, it's just very
[01:16:40.290 --> 01:16:41.290]  uplifting.
[01:16:42.930 --> 01:16:45.130]  It doesn't it doesn't bog you down
[01:16:45.130 --> 01:16:47.250]  mentally and it keeps you on task
[01:16:47.250 --> 01:16:49.250]  and it's it's like, you know, it's
[01:16:49.250 --> 01:16:50.410]  it's something that it is.
[01:16:50.450 --> 01:16:51.450]  I feel like there is a lot of
[01:16:51.450 --> 01:16:53.410]  medicinal benefit to that where you
[01:16:53.410 --> 01:16:55.330]  could consume something and not
[01:16:55.330 --> 01:16:57.450]  have it completely
[01:16:57.530 --> 01:16:59.170]  changed the course of your day.
[01:16:59.890 --> 01:17:01.850]  You could go about business as usual
[01:17:02.410 --> 01:17:04.010]  after smoking a joint of Blue Dream
[01:17:04.490 --> 01:17:06.450]  and it yeah, for that reason, right
[01:17:06.530 --> 01:17:08.450]  there, it's definitely like it's got
[01:17:09.010 --> 01:17:10.690]  it has a place, you know, because
[01:17:10.690 --> 01:17:12.010]  there's there's some things you just
[01:17:12.010 --> 01:17:13.370]  can't smoke all day.
[01:17:14.010 --> 01:17:15.930]  Some of these heavier hitting, you
[01:17:15.930 --> 01:17:17.850]  know, Girl Scout cookie like
[01:17:17.850 --> 01:17:18.810]  that'll ruin your day.
[01:17:18.810 --> 01:17:20.610]  You'll want to hang out, eat potato
[01:17:20.610 --> 01:17:22.370]  chips and Ben and Jerry's all day
[01:17:22.370 --> 01:17:23.370]  like.
[01:17:25.730 --> 01:17:27.650]  No blue jeans, blue dreams
[01:17:27.650 --> 01:17:29.290]  hoodies either, you know, no three
[01:17:29.290 --> 01:17:30.290]  hundred dollar hoodies.
[01:17:30.930 --> 01:17:32.410]  I think Blue Dream's kind of lost
[01:17:32.410 --> 01:17:34.450]  its my body used to make fun
[01:17:34.450 --> 01:17:36.010]  of it like it was, you know, talking
[01:17:36.010 --> 01:17:37.570]  about when people are like, hey,
[01:17:37.570 --> 01:17:38.570]  what music you want to hear at a
[01:17:38.570 --> 01:17:39.730]  party? It's like showing up to the
[01:17:39.730 --> 01:17:40.690]  party and you're like, you know, I
[01:17:40.690 --> 01:17:41.610]  got the nickel back.
[01:17:41.610 --> 01:17:42.610]  Everybody want to smoke?
[01:17:42.690 --> 01:17:44.370]  Like, oh, no, man, we don't want to
[01:17:44.370 --> 01:17:45.370]  hear that shit.
[01:17:46.250 --> 01:17:48.010]  But I do feel like the real shit did
[01:17:48.010 --> 01:17:49.450]  have a have its place.
[01:17:49.730 --> 01:17:51.610]  Just unfortunately, on the
[01:17:51.610 --> 01:17:53.010]  flip side of that, probably what
[01:17:53.410 --> 01:17:55.050]  90 percent of that should seem to be
[01:17:55.050 --> 01:17:55.850]  fake.
[01:17:55.850 --> 01:17:57.490]  A lot of the stuff, the structure
[01:17:57.490 --> 01:17:58.450]  didn't even make sense.
[01:17:58.450 --> 01:17:59.410]  It was a high yielder.
[01:17:59.410 --> 01:18:00.570]  Some of that stuff never even
[01:18:01.410 --> 01:18:02.890]  developed here in Colorado.
[01:18:02.930 --> 01:18:04.130]  And then people are trying to sell
[01:18:05.130 --> 01:18:06.130]  it for premium, man.
[01:18:06.250 --> 01:18:07.410]  And that's what I feel like was the
[01:18:07.410 --> 01:18:08.970]  biggest thing back then is that you
[01:18:08.970 --> 01:18:10.610]  could just bullshit whatever you
[01:18:10.610 --> 01:18:11.610]  want, man.
[01:18:11.610 --> 01:18:13.290]  And then unless you were farming it,
[01:18:13.290 --> 01:18:14.770]  you it was really hard for the
[01:18:14.770 --> 01:18:16.250]  consumer to call people out on that
[01:18:16.250 --> 01:18:17.250]  kind of stuff.
[01:18:17.450 --> 01:18:18.650]  No, yeah, for sure.
[01:18:18.810 --> 01:18:20.290]  It's basically you have to go with
[01:18:20.290 --> 01:18:21.970]  what what they're telling you it is.
[01:18:24.730 --> 01:18:26.050]  You know, it's another strain that
[01:18:26.930 --> 01:18:28.430]  that might, you know, have some
[01:18:28.430 --> 01:18:30.370]  medicinal effects for and have
[01:18:30.410 --> 01:18:32.450]  like a similar not a terpene
[01:18:32.490 --> 01:18:33.770]  profile, but just a similar
[01:18:33.770 --> 01:18:35.730]  psychological effect is blue dream
[01:18:36.130 --> 01:18:38.050]  is like a tangy for me,
[01:18:38.050 --> 01:18:39.930]  at least like smoking tangy is
[01:18:39.930 --> 01:18:42.410]  like very uplifting,
[01:18:42.410 --> 01:18:44.650]  very clearheaded,
[01:18:45.010 --> 01:18:46.650]  a little bit of euphoria in there,
[01:18:46.650 --> 01:18:48.930]  but it doesn't it doesn't radically
[01:18:48.930 --> 01:18:50.770]  alter anything and kind of
[01:18:50.770 --> 01:18:52.210]  bogged me down mentally.
[01:18:52.210 --> 01:18:53.970]  So that that's one that I like in
[01:18:53.970 --> 01:18:55.490]  Tangy gets a lot of slack.
[01:18:55.490 --> 01:18:56.850]  People don't really like that.
[01:18:56.850 --> 01:18:57.850]  A lot of people.
[01:18:58.010 --> 01:18:59.010]  I don't understand it.
[01:18:59.050 --> 01:19:00.090]  I don't understand how you could
[01:19:00.090 --> 01:19:02.030]  smell cannabis that just it
[01:19:02.030 --> 01:19:03.950]  smells like you're peeling an
[01:19:03.950 --> 01:19:05.790]  orange and be like, oh,
[01:19:05.830 --> 01:19:07.430]  gross. But there's a lot of people
[01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:09.230]  who are just like put off by that.
[01:19:09.230 --> 01:19:11.070]  And for me, having
[01:19:11.390 --> 01:19:13.370]  a flower that just is so
[01:19:13.390 --> 01:19:15.510]  similar to a freshly peeled
[01:19:15.510 --> 01:19:17.310]  orange, it's.
[01:19:18.190 --> 01:19:20.390]  It's it's amazing, you know.
[01:19:22.110 --> 01:19:23.510]  For me, anyways, but yeah, I know a
[01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:25.730]  lot of people who are really turned
[01:19:25.730 --> 01:19:27.590]  off by that kind of profile for some
[01:19:27.590 --> 01:19:28.590]  reason.
[01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:33.640]  Yeah, it's just interesting when
[01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:35.140]  you're changing. It was another one
[01:19:35.140 --> 01:19:36.560]  that was pretty expensive, though.
[01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:37.560]  And I.
[01:19:40.250 --> 01:19:41.690]  Yeah, that's the other part, right?
[01:19:43.650 --> 01:19:44.650]  How do you know?
[01:19:45.130 --> 01:19:47.210]  But yeah, I
[01:19:47.210 --> 01:19:48.770]  enjoyed Tangy, too, was it was
[01:19:48.770 --> 01:19:50.250]  another really nice cultivar.
[01:19:50.530 --> 01:19:52.170]  But again, though, the biggest
[01:19:52.170 --> 01:19:53.570]  problem was it was so damn
[01:19:53.570 --> 01:19:54.790]  expensive. I don't know about you
[01:19:54.810 --> 01:19:56.330]  guys, but back on the East Coast,
[01:19:56.330 --> 01:19:57.970]  that shit brought in huge money.
[01:19:59.530 --> 01:20:01.390]  Oh, yeah, it doesn't yield very
[01:20:01.390 --> 01:20:03.530]  well either. So it's like a from
[01:20:03.530 --> 01:20:05.650]  a commercial standpoint,
[01:20:05.650 --> 01:20:06.490]  which is, you know, it's
[01:20:06.490 --> 01:20:08.050]  unfortunate that that's really an
[01:20:08.050 --> 01:20:09.650]  indicator and that's going to be
[01:20:09.930 --> 01:20:11.990]  kind of dictating what's what people
[01:20:11.990 --> 01:20:14.050]  are growing, not necessarily
[01:20:14.050 --> 01:20:16.210]  the effect, not necessarily the
[01:20:16.770 --> 01:20:19.730]  the terpene profile, but solely
[01:20:21.410 --> 01:20:22.570]  solely the yield.
[01:20:22.570 --> 01:20:23.710]  You know, if it doesn't yield well,
[01:20:23.730 --> 01:20:24.770]  people throw it away.
[01:20:25.410 --> 01:20:26.830]  So it's unfortunate because there's
[01:20:26.850 --> 01:20:28.290]  a lot of really great
[01:20:28.850 --> 01:20:30.710]  varieties that just kind of just
[01:20:30.710 --> 01:20:32.010]  get lost because it's not a
[01:20:32.610 --> 01:20:34.970]  commercially viable option
[01:20:35.170 --> 01:20:36.170]  to cultivate.
[01:20:40.300 --> 01:20:42.020]  I wanted to get more into some of
[01:20:42.020 --> 01:20:43.700]  the stuff I noticed you had the
[01:20:43.700 --> 01:20:45.500]  remedy, I think, and I
[01:20:45.500 --> 01:20:46.620]  pronounced that correctly.
[01:20:47.260 --> 01:20:49.500]  I just like the expression
[01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:51.180]  of that one. And I feel like
[01:20:51.540 --> 01:20:52.880]  that's really the next level.
[01:20:52.900 --> 01:20:54.440]  It feels like when you're starting
[01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:55.900]  to get some of these colors that
[01:20:55.900 --> 01:20:58.140]  the average consumer hasn't
[01:20:58.140 --> 01:21:00.180]  seen before, even if when
[01:21:00.180 --> 01:21:01.660]  you're just pulling them out into
[01:21:01.660 --> 01:21:03.540]  flower late into flower and
[01:21:03.540 --> 01:21:04.800]  they do kind of fade or something
[01:21:04.820 --> 01:21:06.260]  like that, I still feel like the
[01:21:06.260 --> 01:21:07.860]  average consumer starts to notice
[01:21:07.860 --> 01:21:08.860]  those little things, the little
[01:21:08.860 --> 01:21:10.540]  hints of different color than just
[01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:11.900]  lime green.
[01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:14.140]  So I wanted to kind
[01:21:14.140 --> 01:21:15.720]  of give a shout out to that that
[01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:17.100]  genetic and kind of talk to you
[01:21:17.100 --> 01:21:18.100]  about that more.
[01:21:19.020 --> 01:21:20.820]  So that was that
[01:21:20.820 --> 01:21:22.700]  was an interesting thing that
[01:21:22.700 --> 01:21:24.660]  really it was it was kind of a.
[01:21:25.900 --> 01:21:27.700]  Like an armchair quarterback
[01:21:27.700 --> 01:21:29.900]  thing that my boss at the time, he
[01:21:29.900 --> 01:21:31.700]  was living in Colorado and
[01:21:31.700 --> 01:21:32.620]  he's like, we're going to get a
[01:21:32.620 --> 01:21:33.680]  high CBD strain.
[01:21:33.700 --> 01:21:34.620]  He's like, we're going to grow the
[01:21:34.620 --> 01:21:36.680]  CBD strain and we have a buyer
[01:21:36.680 --> 01:21:37.820]  set up for it already.
[01:21:38.060 --> 01:21:40.100]  I'm like, OK, like, yeah, we'll
[01:21:40.100 --> 01:21:40.780]  give it a shot.
[01:21:40.780 --> 01:21:42.740]  And and as I watched this
[01:21:42.740 --> 01:21:44.440]  plant do its thing,
[01:21:44.700 --> 01:21:46.260]  I mean, the color of the leaf was
[01:21:46.260 --> 01:21:47.900]  just this kind of bluish
[01:21:48.500 --> 01:21:50.020]  like like I don't know.
[01:21:50.060 --> 01:21:52.180]  It's just such a crazy, crazy
[01:21:52.420 --> 01:21:54.660]  color. And then the stigma
[01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:55.900]  are that, you know, the hairs on the
[01:21:55.900 --> 01:21:58.260]  plant, they were bright pink.
[01:21:58.260 --> 01:21:59.740]  Like when I saw that and I took a
[01:21:59.740 --> 01:22:00.780]  picture, I'm like, people are going
[01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:02.340]  to think that I like Photoshop
[01:22:02.380 --> 01:22:03.380]  this.
[01:22:03.380 --> 01:22:04.980]  It doesn't even doesn't look
[01:22:04.980 --> 01:22:06.540]  real for our audience.
[01:22:06.540 --> 01:22:08.860]  And for Peter, that was June 29th,
[01:22:08.860 --> 01:22:10.900]  2019, if it's possible to pull
[01:22:10.900 --> 01:22:11.860]  that up.
[01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:13.180]  But yeah, it's a very unique
[01:22:13.180 --> 01:22:14.180]  looking.
[01:22:17.340 --> 01:22:18.940]  It was wild, you know, like I said,
[01:22:18.940 --> 01:22:20.040]  I'm taking a picture, I'm like
[01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:21.460]  people are going to bust my balls
[01:22:21.460 --> 01:22:22.940]  and be like, why did you Photoshop
[01:22:22.940 --> 01:22:23.940]  this?
[01:22:23.940 --> 01:22:25.740]  And it had a really
[01:22:25.740 --> 01:22:27.780]  unique kind of berry
[01:22:27.780 --> 01:22:28.780]  aroma to it.
[01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:31.060]  That was it.
[01:22:31.060 --> 01:22:32.260]  I was a treat to grow.
[01:22:32.780 --> 01:22:34.700]  It wasn't a good end
[01:22:34.700 --> 01:22:37.060]  decision because the price per CBD
[01:22:37.060 --> 01:22:38.740]  pound was significantly less
[01:22:40.180 --> 01:22:41.860]  than the price of like a pound of,
[01:22:41.860 --> 01:22:43.820]  you know, regular THC flour.
[01:22:44.460 --> 01:22:45.700]  But, you know, that was one of those
[01:22:45.700 --> 01:22:47.620]  mistakes I got to learn for like he
[01:22:47.620 --> 01:22:49.220]  was like, oh, we'll grow all the CBD
[01:22:49.220 --> 01:22:51.220]  and and it just wasn't a great
[01:22:51.220 --> 01:22:53.500]  move. But I was I is a cultivator
[01:22:53.500 --> 01:22:55.380]  and as a, you know,
[01:22:55.860 --> 01:22:56.860]  cannabis, you
[01:22:57.780 --> 01:22:59.700]  know, enthusiast
[01:23:00.020 --> 01:23:02.020]  seeing that plant do its thing was
[01:23:02.020 --> 01:23:03.020]  was amazing.
[01:23:04.340 --> 01:23:06.260]  Now, if you feel like the consumer
[01:23:06.260 --> 01:23:08.180]  was better educated and would
[01:23:08.180 --> 01:23:10.620]  pay more for high quality
[01:23:11.780 --> 01:23:13.540]  CBD like that, do you feel like
[01:23:13.540 --> 01:23:15.540]  there should or eventually
[01:23:15.540 --> 01:23:17.740]  would be a place in the market for
[01:23:17.740 --> 01:23:19.780]  really high end minor
[01:23:19.780 --> 01:23:20.780]  cannabinoids?
[01:23:21.260 --> 01:23:22.180]  Absolutely.
[01:23:22.180 --> 01:23:23.820]  Absolutely. I actually bought
[01:23:24.660 --> 01:23:25.900]  I bought my wife
[01:23:26.020 --> 01:23:27.020]  a jar
[01:23:28.820 --> 01:23:30.660]  of CBD flour from
[01:23:30.660 --> 01:23:33.140]  this this place that it was expensive.
[01:23:33.140 --> 01:23:34.700]  It was like a quarter and it cost
[01:23:34.700 --> 01:23:36.260]  like 70 bucks
[01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:39.100]  where I was like, wow, this is like
[01:23:39.100 --> 01:23:41.140]  just as much as some flour.
[01:23:41.860 --> 01:23:43.820]  But the terpene profile
[01:23:43.820 --> 01:23:45.260]  of it was
[01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:47.740]  really incredible.
[01:23:47.740 --> 01:23:49.060]  It had kind of like a
[01:23:49.700 --> 01:23:51.700]  lemony apple kind
[01:23:51.700 --> 01:23:52.700]  of smell to it.
[01:23:52.780 --> 01:23:54.580]  And I opened up the jar and I'm like,
[01:23:54.580 --> 01:23:55.820]  OK, like this is the one.
[01:23:55.820 --> 01:23:57.340]  And I was like happy to pay that
[01:23:57.340 --> 01:23:59.540]  price because sometimes
[01:23:59.540 --> 01:24:00.740]  people, they don't
[01:24:01.260 --> 01:24:03.060]  they they want to smoke something.
[01:24:03.060 --> 01:24:04.460]  They want to pop on something, but
[01:24:04.460 --> 01:24:06.100]  they don't want to they don't want
[01:24:06.100 --> 01:24:08.060]  to get super blazed
[01:24:08.700 --> 01:24:09.700]  all the time.
[01:24:09.860 --> 01:24:11.500]  So I kind of got that for her is
[01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:13.420]  like a gift is like here, you
[01:24:13.420 --> 01:24:14.540]  know, so you don't have to get
[01:24:15.220 --> 01:24:17.140]  absolutely wrecked during the
[01:24:17.140 --> 01:24:18.580]  day when you just feel like smoking
[01:24:18.580 --> 01:24:19.540]  a joint.
[01:24:19.540 --> 01:24:21.540]  And so I totally
[01:24:21.540 --> 01:24:23.020]  think that there is there
[01:24:23.300 --> 01:24:25.180]  you know, can be and should be a
[01:24:25.180 --> 01:24:26.300]  market for that stuff.
[01:24:26.740 --> 01:24:28.780]  And there's no reason really
[01:24:28.780 --> 01:24:30.620]  why if it's
[01:24:30.620 --> 01:24:32.300]  craft and it's grown well and the
[01:24:32.300 --> 01:24:34.180]  genetics are good and it's executed
[01:24:34.180 --> 01:24:35.940]  properly, why it should be,
[01:24:36.140 --> 01:24:37.980]  you know, a fraction of the
[01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:38.980]  price, I don't think
[01:24:39.940 --> 01:24:41.140]  because it's not it's not just some
[01:24:41.140 --> 01:24:42.980]  like ditch weed, you know,
[01:24:44.060 --> 01:24:45.700]  like hemp that people are growing.
[01:24:45.700 --> 01:24:47.140]  It's really like the people who
[01:24:47.500 --> 01:24:49.660]  work these lines did a great job
[01:24:49.660 --> 01:24:50.660]  in making that happen.
[01:24:51.340 --> 01:24:52.980]  Who made that seed, by the way?
[01:24:53.220 --> 01:24:54.620]  Because that's that's
[01:24:55.180 --> 01:24:56.460]  from my experience.
[01:24:56.460 --> 01:24:58.900]  I look beautiful from a CBD
[01:24:58.900 --> 01:24:59.900]  standpoint.
[01:25:00.500 --> 01:25:02.700]  The remedy that we
[01:25:02.700 --> 01:25:04.580]  got it from Dark Heart, I
[01:25:04.580 --> 01:25:05.580]  believe.
[01:25:05.940 --> 01:25:07.220]  So it was clone form.
[01:25:07.980 --> 01:25:09.900]  And yeah, they I believe that,
[01:25:09.900 --> 01:25:11.500]  you know, four years ago they had
[01:25:11.500 --> 01:25:12.820]  that kind of in their
[01:25:13.700 --> 01:25:14.780]  in their inventory.
[01:25:16.260 --> 01:25:18.220]  Dark Heart from what I understand
[01:25:18.220 --> 01:25:20.060]  is the originator of a lot of
[01:25:20.060 --> 01:25:21.060]  things.
[01:25:22.020 --> 01:25:23.020]  Trace it back.
[01:25:23.860 --> 01:25:25.180]  I hope I'm speaking correctly on
[01:25:25.180 --> 01:25:26.380]  that, or at least that's the lure.
[01:25:27.100 --> 01:25:28.820]  They put a lot of stuff out there
[01:25:28.820 --> 01:25:30.380]  and they're a huge, huge
[01:25:30.820 --> 01:25:31.820]  aspect.
[01:25:34.300 --> 01:25:35.300]  What was that?
[01:25:35.380 --> 01:25:36.420]  Yeah, I think you're delayed.
[01:25:36.420 --> 01:25:38.140]  So backing it up a little bit,
[01:25:38.740 --> 01:25:39.740]  shall I?
[01:25:39.780 --> 01:25:40.780]  I said.
[01:25:42.420 --> 01:25:43.420]  Is it me?
[01:25:44.060 --> 01:25:44.860]  My delay?
[01:25:44.860 --> 01:25:45.860]  Go for it.
[01:25:46.460 --> 01:25:47.460]  Can you hear me?
[01:25:47.860 --> 01:25:48.860]  Yeah, I can hear you.
[01:25:48.860 --> 01:25:49.860]  I got better.
[01:25:50.500 --> 01:25:52.340]  All right. So shout out
[01:25:52.340 --> 01:25:53.340]  to Josh Deans.
[01:25:54.340 --> 01:25:55.780]  He's doing this right now.
[01:25:55.820 --> 01:25:57.620]  He's he's got a CBD
[01:25:57.620 --> 01:25:59.940]  grow. I think is in Chicago
[01:25:59.940 --> 01:26:01.340]  or somewhere, Ohio.
[01:26:02.180 --> 01:26:04.100]  Just for that reason, just for like
[01:26:04.780 --> 01:26:06.740]  the Nobacco movement so that people
[01:26:06.740 --> 01:26:08.780]  can smoke something
[01:26:08.820 --> 01:26:10.860]  but not not tobacco
[01:26:10.860 --> 01:26:12.700]  and not get train wrecked,
[01:26:12.700 --> 01:26:13.580]  like you said.
[01:26:13.580 --> 01:26:15.660]  And, you know, I big ups
[01:26:15.660 --> 01:26:16.580]  to him for doing it.
[01:26:16.580 --> 01:26:17.580]  And he's he's
[01:26:18.940 --> 01:26:20.700]  totally believes there is a solid
[01:26:20.700 --> 01:26:22.660]  market for for the flower
[01:26:22.660 --> 01:26:23.980]  and the and the pre-roll.
[01:26:23.980 --> 01:26:25.900]  So and I agree.
[01:26:25.900 --> 01:26:27.700]  I mean, there's nothing better
[01:26:27.700 --> 01:26:29.300]  than taking a little really high
[01:26:29.300 --> 01:26:31.100]  grade CBD flower, grinding
[01:26:31.100 --> 01:26:32.660]  it up with some THC if you just
[01:26:32.660 --> 01:26:33.780]  don't want to get whacked.
[01:26:34.180 --> 01:26:36.060]  You know, I'm a big fan
[01:26:36.060 --> 01:26:37.060]  of that.
[01:26:37.220 --> 01:26:38.700]  So how did that stuff smoke,
[01:26:38.700 --> 01:26:40.180]  incidentally, or did you make it for
[01:26:40.180 --> 01:26:41.180]  extra?
[01:26:41.220 --> 01:26:42.220]  You grow it for extra.
[01:26:42.940 --> 01:26:44.780]  So it was grown largely
[01:26:44.780 --> 01:26:45.580]  for extracts.
[01:26:45.580 --> 01:26:47.060]  But of course, you know, I was able
[01:26:47.060 --> 01:26:48.740]  to sample some and it
[01:26:48.740 --> 01:26:50.660]  made a good smoke as
[01:26:50.660 --> 01:26:52.540]  it dried those kind of purple
[01:26:53.380 --> 01:26:54.900]  magenta stigmas
[01:26:55.620 --> 01:26:56.620]  really
[01:26:57.780 --> 01:26:59.420]  they they didn't hold their color.
[01:26:59.620 --> 01:27:01.060]  They kind of turned like a brownish
[01:27:01.060 --> 01:27:02.740]  color, which I feel like is kind of
[01:27:02.740 --> 01:27:04.140]  common for those if you see
[01:27:04.140 --> 01:27:05.420]  varieties, because I've seen some
[01:27:05.420 --> 01:27:06.420]  THC, high THC
[01:27:07.660 --> 01:27:09.220]  strands that will have the purple
[01:27:09.220 --> 01:27:11.220]  stigmas and they kind of they dry
[01:27:11.220 --> 01:27:12.660]  up and they lose some of that
[01:27:13.460 --> 01:27:15.300]  that luster, you know, that bright
[01:27:15.300 --> 01:27:16.300]  vibrancy.
[01:27:16.420 --> 01:27:17.420]  But it smoked
[01:27:17.420 --> 01:27:18.980]  really well, like I said, it had
[01:27:18.980 --> 01:27:20.700]  like a nice sweet
[01:27:20.700 --> 01:27:22.700]  berry kind of aroma
[01:27:22.700 --> 01:27:23.700]  and flavor to it
[01:27:24.940 --> 01:27:26.620]  that, you know, I was happy to have
[01:27:26.620 --> 01:27:28.140]  around. I was happy to have, you
[01:27:28.140 --> 01:27:29.380]  know, a nice little head stash of
[01:27:29.380 --> 01:27:30.820]  that stuff for special
[01:27:30.820 --> 01:27:32.420]  occasions, you know, for when I was
[01:27:32.420 --> 01:27:33.900]  driving or,
[01:27:34.700 --> 01:27:36.140]  you know, when I was just like kind
[01:27:36.140 --> 01:27:37.140]  of like had to have
[01:27:37.780 --> 01:27:38.780]  more of a clear head.
[01:27:39.980 --> 01:27:41.220]  That stuff was nice to have around.
[01:27:41.220 --> 01:27:42.860]  So, yeah, I really, really
[01:27:42.860 --> 01:27:44.060]  think there is a good
[01:27:44.060 --> 01:27:45.460]  chance that you can get some of
[01:27:45.540 --> 01:27:47.340]  really think there is a place for
[01:27:47.620 --> 01:27:49.100]  for CBD, but
[01:27:49.460 --> 01:27:51.340]  to kind of have like a market share
[01:27:52.060 --> 01:27:53.300]  because not everybody wants to get
[01:27:53.300 --> 01:27:54.900]  high. And I do think there is a lot
[01:27:54.900 --> 01:27:56.540]  of medicinal benefit that can
[01:27:56.860 --> 01:27:58.660]  it can be kind of given
[01:27:58.780 --> 01:27:59.780]  via CBD.
[01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:04.340]  It definitely seems like the like
[01:28:04.340 --> 01:28:06.220]  the soccer mom crowd, like if you
[01:28:06.220 --> 01:28:07.580]  gave them quality stuff where it
[01:28:07.580 --> 01:28:08.740]  didn't make them where they couldn't
[01:28:08.740 --> 01:28:10.460]  be a parent and
[01:28:10.460 --> 01:28:11.700]  still go throughout their day
[01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:14.300]  and not smoke cigarettes or what
[01:28:14.340 --> 01:28:15.300]  you know, whatever the other thing
[01:28:15.300 --> 01:28:16.300]  is, it seems like
[01:28:17.100 --> 01:28:18.820]  the reality is most of the times
[01:28:19.220 --> 01:28:20.660]  from my experience, when you even go
[01:28:20.660 --> 01:28:22.860]  to some of these like specialty,
[01:28:22.860 --> 01:28:24.420]  so-called CBD
[01:28:24.740 --> 01:28:26.740]  places, it's still really
[01:28:26.740 --> 01:28:27.740]  brown.
[01:28:27.780 --> 01:28:29.140]  It reminds you of just like looking
[01:28:29.140 --> 01:28:30.700]  at a bunch of brick weed from back
[01:28:30.700 --> 01:28:31.660]  in the day.
[01:28:31.660 --> 01:28:33.020]  They're like, this does this.
[01:28:33.020 --> 01:28:34.460]  And you're looking at it like, no,
[01:28:34.460 --> 01:28:36.140]  that doesn't you know, it's not
[01:28:36.820 --> 01:28:38.500]  there's not very much quality out
[01:28:38.500 --> 01:28:40.460]  there. And that's probably why
[01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:42.220]  like you had mentioned,
[01:28:42.220 --> 01:28:44.260]  you know, Steensland sees that for
[01:28:44.260 --> 01:28:46.100]  what it is, especially being in
[01:28:46.100 --> 01:28:47.580]  Ohio. I believe his company is
[01:28:47.580 --> 01:28:50.020]  called Ohio Fire Factory.
[01:28:50.820 --> 01:28:52.380]  So hopefully I said that correctly.
[01:28:52.380 --> 01:28:53.580]  But shout out to those guys.
[01:28:53.580 --> 01:28:55.180]  There's a there's a lot of people I
[01:28:55.180 --> 01:28:56.500]  feel like that are about to come on
[01:28:56.500 --> 01:28:57.940]  board here in the next few years
[01:28:58.180 --> 01:28:59.820]  that are definitely more focused
[01:28:59.820 --> 01:29:02.060]  with a living soil, building soil
[01:29:02.060 --> 01:29:03.980]  mindset than conventional
[01:29:03.980 --> 01:29:04.980]  methods.
[01:29:11.010 --> 01:29:12.370]  You want to keep rocking out?
[01:29:12.690 --> 01:29:13.770]  Did it fix itself?
[01:29:15.810 --> 01:29:16.890]  Yes, pretty good now.
[01:29:16.890 --> 01:29:17.890]  Can you hear me?
[01:29:19.170 --> 01:29:20.170]  Yes.
[01:29:21.690 --> 01:29:23.250]  All right. Am I delayed because you
[01:29:23.250 --> 01:29:24.250]  guys are glitching?
[01:29:24.410 --> 01:29:25.410]  No.
[01:29:26.210 --> 01:29:27.210]  No, man.
[01:29:28.490 --> 01:29:29.490]  Fuck the Internet.
[01:29:29.530 --> 01:29:31.050]  You're good. You're good, Lane.
[01:29:31.090 --> 01:29:32.370]  I think you're good. We might be
[01:29:32.370 --> 01:29:33.370]  good for you.
[01:29:33.410 --> 01:29:34.410]  You got to.
[01:29:35.010 --> 01:29:36.010]  Brian, you want to roll in this?
[01:29:38.170 --> 01:29:40.170]  What I have to I noticed
[01:29:40.170 --> 01:29:41.690]  that you have here's another thing
[01:29:41.690 --> 01:29:42.810]  with Blue Dreams or whatever.
[01:29:42.810 --> 01:29:43.810]  Right. I can like.
[01:29:44.250 --> 01:29:45.250]  Yeah.
[01:29:46.210 --> 01:29:47.530]  Yeah, he's glitching for sure.
[01:29:50.010 --> 01:29:51.770]  So, Johnny, the San Fernando
[01:29:52.010 --> 01:29:53.770]  Valley, oh, gee, I felt like that
[01:29:53.770 --> 01:29:55.250]  was another one that so
[01:29:55.770 --> 01:29:56.770]  many people claim.
[01:29:56.810 --> 01:29:57.810]  You're glitching, too.
[01:30:00.010 --> 01:30:01.450]  So he's so lagged.
[01:30:01.490 --> 01:30:02.490]  He like.
[01:30:03.050 --> 01:30:04.450]  Am I glitching or am I good?
[01:30:05.370 --> 01:30:06.370]  I hear you.
[01:30:06.410 --> 01:30:08.370]  Yeah, everybody is good to me.
[01:30:10.530 --> 01:30:12.170]  Maybe restart your computer.
[01:30:12.170 --> 01:30:13.650]  I'm going to restart my computer.
[01:30:13.650 --> 01:30:14.650]  I'm going to restart my computer.
[01:30:14.650 --> 01:30:15.810]  You start your computer up.
[01:30:18.770 --> 01:30:20.450]  I noticed I'll hear that in 30
[01:30:20.450 --> 01:30:21.450]  seconds.
[01:30:26.210 --> 01:30:27.330]  Yeah, that's I kind of wanted to
[01:30:27.330 --> 01:30:29.090]  get into that because it seemed
[01:30:29.090 --> 01:30:31.070]  like your color expression
[01:30:31.090 --> 01:30:32.330]  when you were showing that one.
[01:30:33.690 --> 01:30:34.690]  Did I write that down?
[01:30:34.690 --> 01:30:35.730]  I don't know if I wrote down that
[01:30:35.970 --> 01:30:36.970]  that date, but that
[01:30:37.890 --> 01:30:39.370]  seemed like legit to me, like the
[01:30:39.370 --> 01:30:41.490]  same thing with like the gorilla
[01:30:41.490 --> 01:30:42.650]  glues and stuff like that.
[01:30:42.650 --> 01:30:44.490]  You know, the those genetics had
[01:30:44.490 --> 01:30:46.330]  more of an expression than what
[01:30:46.330 --> 01:30:48.330]  you saw passed around from buddy
[01:30:48.330 --> 01:30:49.330]  to buddy.
[01:30:49.410 --> 01:30:50.650]  So I wanted to kind of get deeper
[01:30:50.650 --> 01:30:52.070]  into the San Fernando Valley
[01:30:52.090 --> 01:30:53.050]  because I felt like that was a
[01:30:53.050 --> 01:30:55.010]  classic, especially if you had
[01:30:55.010 --> 01:30:56.410]  the connections for the real stuff.
[01:30:57.170 --> 01:30:58.410]  The lawyers and the doctors would
[01:30:58.410 --> 01:31:00.250]  pay a premium just to be able
[01:31:00.250 --> 01:31:01.450]  to kind of smell it almost like a
[01:31:01.450 --> 01:31:02.490]  Durban poison or something.
[01:31:02.490 --> 01:31:03.810]  Like if you crack that jar and that
[01:31:03.810 --> 01:31:05.830]  took them back to whatever
[01:31:05.830 --> 01:31:07.150]  nostalgia made them want to keep
[01:31:07.150 --> 01:31:08.850]  smoking that that was
[01:31:09.370 --> 01:31:10.210]  a contact that you could
[01:31:10.210 --> 01:31:11.830]  potentially have for years because
[01:31:12.210 --> 01:31:14.290]  you had that the scent
[01:31:14.290 --> 01:31:15.930]  that their their mind was craving.
[01:31:17.330 --> 01:31:19.130]  Oh, yeah. SFV is like
[01:31:20.250 --> 01:31:22.130]  it's a staple and it was always
[01:31:22.130 --> 01:31:23.330]  something, you know,
[01:31:24.210 --> 01:31:25.530]  that I grew for the first
[01:31:26.450 --> 01:31:28.410]  six years I was in Humboldt.
[01:31:28.850 --> 01:31:30.210]  That was something that, you know,
[01:31:30.490 --> 01:31:32.150]  multiple of my bosses would have
[01:31:32.150 --> 01:31:34.170]  around and it would always sell.
[01:31:34.370 --> 01:31:36.090]  People love that stuff.
[01:31:37.170 --> 01:31:38.650]  It's just it has such a
[01:31:39.530 --> 01:31:41.410]  you know, it has that classic OG
[01:31:41.410 --> 01:31:43.450]  nose, but this like hint of
[01:31:43.450 --> 01:31:44.450]  like.
[01:31:45.250 --> 01:31:46.850]  Sour, fruity,
[01:31:47.370 --> 01:31:49.210]  like like sour fruit
[01:31:49.210 --> 01:31:50.570]  and gas all combined.
[01:31:50.610 --> 01:31:52.490]  And, yeah, people love it.
[01:31:53.330 --> 01:31:54.890]  I got really sick of it after
[01:31:54.890 --> 01:31:56.690]  cultivating it so much
[01:31:56.690 --> 01:31:57.930]  where it was just like some years
[01:31:57.930 --> 01:31:59.090]  I'd be like the only thing that I
[01:31:59.090 --> 01:32:00.090]  would grow.
[01:32:00.410 --> 01:32:01.970]  So it got, you know, really boring
[01:32:01.970 --> 01:32:02.970]  and repetitive for me.
[01:32:03.010 --> 01:32:04.850]  But now seeing I haven't grown
[01:32:04.850 --> 01:32:06.330]  it in a few seasons, I'm like
[01:32:06.330 --> 01:32:07.330]  craving it.
[01:32:07.610 --> 01:32:09.290]  I really, really miss
[01:32:09.570 --> 01:32:10.890]  the SFV OG.
[01:32:10.930 --> 01:32:12.930]  And yeah, there is there's a lot of
[01:32:13.410 --> 01:32:14.970]  imitations and there's a lot of
[01:32:14.970 --> 01:32:16.610]  different variations of OG in
[01:32:16.610 --> 01:32:17.610]  general.
[01:32:18.730 --> 01:32:20.610]  You know, I mean, that plus,
[01:32:20.650 --> 01:32:22.490]  you know, hop latent viroid being
[01:32:22.490 --> 01:32:23.490]  around.
[01:32:23.570 --> 01:32:25.470]  It's so you might be getting
[01:32:25.470 --> 01:32:26.650]  something that's not SFV.
[01:32:26.690 --> 01:32:27.810]  You might be getting something that
[01:32:27.810 --> 01:32:29.970]  is SFV that has hop latent viroid
[01:32:30.530 --> 01:32:32.690]  and, you know, getting a really
[01:32:32.690 --> 01:32:33.730]  good cut of that stuff.
[01:32:33.770 --> 01:32:35.490]  It's clean and is what it's supposed
[01:32:35.490 --> 01:32:36.490]  to be.
[01:32:37.410 --> 01:32:39.050]  It's special and people still ask
[01:32:39.050 --> 01:32:40.970]  for it by name, even though
[01:32:40.970 --> 01:32:42.610]  it's you know, it's kind of
[01:32:43.730 --> 01:32:44.570]  antiquated.
[01:32:44.570 --> 01:32:45.410]  You know, it's been around for a
[01:32:45.410 --> 01:32:47.450]  long time, but people
[01:32:47.450 --> 01:32:48.930]  still eat it up.
[01:32:53.010 --> 01:32:54.890]  Yeah. And I noticed shout
[01:32:54.890 --> 01:32:56.530]  out to Toad kind of
[01:32:56.530 --> 01:32:57.890]  clarifying some things because
[01:32:58.290 --> 01:33:00.370]  it's really hard to know these days
[01:33:00.890 --> 01:33:02.250]  when you're really getting real
[01:33:02.250 --> 01:33:03.250]  genetics.
[01:33:04.010 --> 01:33:05.670]  I know, you know, I before we came
[01:33:05.670 --> 01:33:06.850]  on the show, we were talking about
[01:33:06.850 --> 01:33:09.010]  the 12 hour marathon that the
[01:33:09.170 --> 01:33:10.170]  those boys did with
[01:33:11.010 --> 01:33:12.850]  a guy that I feel like is under,
[01:33:13.050 --> 01:33:14.490]  you know, here in Colorado, a lot of
[01:33:14.490 --> 01:33:16.410]  people know of his work.
[01:33:16.450 --> 01:33:18.850]  His name is to shout out to where
[01:33:18.850 --> 01:33:19.730]  you kind of break it down.
[01:33:19.730 --> 01:33:20.730]  A lot of that stuff. I don't feel
[01:33:20.730 --> 01:33:21.970]  like a lot of people know where the
[01:33:21.970 --> 01:33:23.330]  real artwork came from.
[01:33:23.330 --> 01:33:24.570]  And then other people,
[01:33:24.570 --> 01:33:26.490]  unfortunately, are just
[01:33:27.090 --> 01:33:29.050]  greedy or opportunistic
[01:33:29.050 --> 01:33:31.050]  and kind of fuck over the original.
[01:33:31.050 --> 01:33:32.690]  So it's nice to know where this
[01:33:32.690 --> 01:33:33.890]  stuff came from, because if you're
[01:33:33.890 --> 01:33:35.890]  after the actual medicine aspect
[01:33:35.890 --> 01:33:38.090]  of it, then you need the original.
[01:33:40.810 --> 01:33:41.690]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:33:41.690 --> 01:33:43.250]  I mean, having the integrity there
[01:33:43.250 --> 01:33:44.490]  with genetics, it's
[01:33:45.370 --> 01:33:46.210]  it's huge.
[01:33:46.210 --> 01:33:47.330]  And I feel like it's something we're
[01:33:47.330 --> 01:33:49.010]  going to be seeing more and more
[01:33:49.530 --> 01:33:51.370]  as the industry progresses, people
[01:33:51.370 --> 01:33:53.330]  selling knockoffs, people selling
[01:33:53.330 --> 01:33:54.410]  dirty genetics,
[01:33:55.610 --> 01:33:56.890]  people taking credit for other
[01:33:56.890 --> 01:33:57.890]  people's work.
[01:33:59.610 --> 01:34:00.890]  And, you know, we're going to be
[01:34:01.010 --> 01:34:03.210]  watching this kind of unfold as,
[01:34:03.210 --> 01:34:04.570]  you know, I've already heard talks
[01:34:04.570 --> 01:34:06.490]  of of like patenting
[01:34:06.490 --> 01:34:07.690]  different cultivars.
[01:34:08.170 --> 01:34:09.530]  And, you know, I
[01:34:10.210 --> 01:34:11.770]  I understand the sentiment to
[01:34:11.770 --> 01:34:13.090]  protect the small breeder.
[01:34:13.530 --> 01:34:14.690]  But when it comes down to it, I
[01:34:14.690 --> 01:34:16.650]  think that's mainly what
[01:34:16.650 --> 01:34:17.530]  that's going to that's going to
[01:34:17.530 --> 01:34:19.650]  protect is the large
[01:34:19.650 --> 01:34:21.570]  scale commercial operation
[01:34:21.570 --> 01:34:23.650]  and the small guy might get left
[01:34:23.650 --> 01:34:24.650]  in the dust.
[01:34:25.410 --> 01:34:27.250]  So, yeah, it's just it's sad to
[01:34:27.250 --> 01:34:28.890]  see. And there used to be a lot more
[01:34:28.890 --> 01:34:30.850]  like honor and integrity
[01:34:30.850 --> 01:34:33.250]  in in the kind of genetic game
[01:34:33.330 --> 01:34:34.970]  where I feel like now more so than
[01:34:34.970 --> 01:34:36.730]  ever. It's just, yeah, it's ripe
[01:34:36.730 --> 01:34:38.570]  with people selling
[01:34:38.570 --> 01:34:40.570]  knockoffs and selling disease
[01:34:40.570 --> 01:34:42.530]  cuts and just taking yeah, taking
[01:34:42.530 --> 01:34:43.530]  credit.
[01:34:44.410 --> 01:34:46.210]  So, yeah, it's going to be
[01:34:46.290 --> 01:34:47.290]  an interesting,
[01:34:48.810 --> 01:34:50.690]  interesting few years as, you know,
[01:34:50.810 --> 01:34:52.050]  people are trying to patent
[01:34:52.090 --> 01:34:53.090]  genetics
[01:34:54.130 --> 01:34:55.490]  and see how that unfolds.
[01:34:57.730 --> 01:34:58.730]  You know, it's funny.
[01:34:58.810 --> 01:34:59.810]  I went to a
[01:35:01.810 --> 01:35:03.530]  gathering a couple of years back
[01:35:04.490 --> 01:35:05.490]  that
[01:35:06.410 --> 01:35:08.090]  with Dragonfly Earth Medicine at
[01:35:08.570 --> 01:35:09.770]  Heartwood Sanctuary.
[01:35:09.810 --> 01:35:11.810]  And that was a big hot topic
[01:35:11.810 --> 01:35:12.810]  about how
[01:35:13.650 --> 01:35:15.010]  there's been a couple of utility
[01:35:15.010 --> 01:35:16.610]  patents filed by some big
[01:35:16.610 --> 01:35:18.450]  businessmen that nobody really knows
[01:35:18.450 --> 01:35:19.450]  who's behind it.
[01:35:19.970 --> 01:35:22.010]  And I think the sentiment there
[01:35:22.010 --> 01:35:23.570]  was like we just got to
[01:35:23.810 --> 01:35:25.570]  outbreed them, just keep ahead of
[01:35:25.570 --> 01:35:26.570]  the curve like.
[01:35:27.130 --> 01:35:28.730]  But in order to do that, you really
[01:35:28.730 --> 01:35:31.050]  need some really good royalty
[01:35:31.050 --> 01:35:32.890]  stock, perhaps some land races
[01:35:32.890 --> 01:35:34.370]  or something else to start weaving
[01:35:34.370 --> 01:35:36.210]  back in because the genetic pool's
[01:35:36.210 --> 01:35:38.210]  gotten pretty, pretty fucked
[01:35:38.210 --> 01:35:40.250]  up over the last 40 years because
[01:35:40.250 --> 01:35:41.650]  of all this crossing and
[01:35:41.650 --> 01:35:42.650]  inbreeding. So
[01:35:43.610 --> 01:35:44.930]  I think that I think the way to
[01:35:44.930 --> 01:35:46.770]  protect yourself is,
[01:35:46.850 --> 01:35:48.130]  you know, is just outbreed
[01:35:48.130 --> 01:35:49.010]  motherfuckers.
[01:35:49.010 --> 01:35:50.410]  You know, just keep getting further
[01:35:50.410 --> 01:35:52.370]  and further away with hopefully
[01:35:52.370 --> 01:35:54.530]  some land race crosses
[01:35:54.530 --> 01:35:56.530]  back into this new work.
[01:35:57.090 --> 01:35:58.170]  But yeah, it is.
[01:35:58.170 --> 01:35:59.970]  It's crazy times for sure.
[01:36:02.770 --> 01:36:04.330]  That's why I keep a big, nice
[01:36:04.330 --> 01:36:05.410]  collection of seeds.
[01:36:06.490 --> 01:36:08.450]  I see I have like a
[01:36:08.530 --> 01:36:10.130]  problem where I see something.
[01:36:10.130 --> 01:36:12.090]  And regardless of how many packs
[01:36:12.090 --> 01:36:13.410]  of seeds that I have, that I have
[01:36:13.410 --> 01:36:15.210]  it popped, I see something I'm like,
[01:36:15.210 --> 01:36:16.930]  I got to have that just in case.
[01:36:17.730 --> 01:36:19.330]  So I've been slowly
[01:36:19.570 --> 01:36:21.570]  stockpiling and I
[01:36:22.210 --> 01:36:23.730]  definitely have some some breeding
[01:36:23.730 --> 01:36:25.610]  projects that I as soon as
[01:36:25.610 --> 01:36:27.690]  I have the time and space to do,
[01:36:27.690 --> 01:36:29.930]  I'm just like itching, itching
[01:36:29.930 --> 01:36:31.650]  to do. And, you know, I feel
[01:36:31.650 --> 01:36:33.410]  like even losing
[01:36:33.410 --> 01:36:35.290]  some genetics, there
[01:36:35.290 --> 01:36:37.130]  was a particular cultivar that was
[01:36:37.130 --> 01:36:39.330]  grown in in my hometown
[01:36:40.330 --> 01:36:41.610]  called Silver Pearl.
[01:36:41.610 --> 01:36:43.370]  It was this this
[01:36:43.890 --> 01:36:46.090]  cultivar from Amsterdam.
[01:36:46.090 --> 01:36:47.690]  It won like the High Times Cannabis
[01:36:47.690 --> 01:36:49.410]  Cup in like ninety six or something
[01:36:49.410 --> 01:36:50.250]  like that.
[01:36:50.250 --> 01:36:51.890]  So it was like when I was a six year
[01:36:51.890 --> 01:36:53.810]  old, but that was floating around
[01:36:53.810 --> 01:36:55.090]  and people had cuts of that.
[01:36:55.370 --> 01:36:57.530]  And the indoor growers were growing
[01:36:57.530 --> 01:36:58.530]  it where I grew up.
[01:36:58.850 --> 01:37:00.410]  And I look for seeds for that.
[01:37:01.530 --> 01:37:02.530]  You can't find them.
[01:37:03.170 --> 01:37:04.370]  You can't find them anywhere.
[01:37:05.570 --> 01:37:07.490]  So I actually I reached
[01:37:07.490 --> 01:37:09.530]  out to Sensi Seeds in
[01:37:09.530 --> 01:37:11.450]  Amsterdam and and
[01:37:11.450 --> 01:37:12.650]  I know the cross.
[01:37:12.650 --> 01:37:14.210]  It's a Northern Lights cross with a
[01:37:14.210 --> 01:37:15.970]  skunk number one, Northern Lights
[01:37:15.970 --> 01:37:17.330]  number five, cross with skunk number
[01:37:17.330 --> 01:37:19.090]  one and a
[01:37:19.450 --> 01:37:20.450]  an early pearl.
[01:37:21.090 --> 01:37:23.090]  And I have all
[01:37:23.090 --> 01:37:25.010]  of those. I made sure to get
[01:37:25.010 --> 01:37:26.810]  all of them. And one day, like
[01:37:27.170 --> 01:37:28.410]  I just want to, you know,
[01:37:29.170 --> 01:37:30.170]  try to make it happen.
[01:37:30.170 --> 01:37:31.970]  They even told me what they used for
[01:37:31.970 --> 01:37:33.410]  the for the male and the female.
[01:37:33.770 --> 01:37:35.850]  And I'll frickin I want to do a big
[01:37:35.850 --> 01:37:38.010]  pheno hunt and just try to find
[01:37:38.290 --> 01:37:40.370]  that nostalgic feeling and get
[01:37:40.370 --> 01:37:42.250]  that that's her
[01:37:42.250 --> 01:37:43.930]  being profile back because,
[01:37:44.170 --> 01:37:46.050]  man, that was some of that was
[01:37:46.050 --> 01:37:47.250]  the first good weed that I ever
[01:37:47.250 --> 01:37:48.130]  smoked.
[01:37:48.130 --> 01:37:49.930]  I was smoking a bunch of CD,
[01:37:50.370 --> 01:37:52.410]  you know, brick, brown brick weed.
[01:37:52.410 --> 01:37:54.730]  It was probably moldy and crappy.
[01:37:55.170 --> 01:37:56.490]  And then my uncle,
[01:37:57.010 --> 01:37:58.530]  he had some indoor that he was
[01:37:58.530 --> 01:38:00.290]  growing. He finally one day showed
[01:38:00.290 --> 01:38:01.290]  me the indoor.
[01:38:01.650 --> 01:38:03.770]  He showed me his little closet grow
[01:38:04.210 --> 01:38:05.450]  and he had silver pearl.
[01:38:05.450 --> 01:38:06.810]  And man, that
[01:38:07.570 --> 01:38:09.290]  talk about nostalgia that is
[01:38:09.290 --> 01:38:10.730]  thinking about it gets me all warm
[01:38:10.730 --> 01:38:11.610]  and fuzzy inside.
[01:38:11.610 --> 01:38:13.530]  So, yeah, one day I want to be able
[01:38:13.530 --> 01:38:14.690]  to try to recreate that.
[01:38:14.730 --> 01:38:16.850]  But, yeah, having a genetic stock
[01:38:16.850 --> 01:38:18.730]  because, yeah, we are losing some
[01:38:18.730 --> 01:38:20.770]  some cultivars, some of them like
[01:38:20.770 --> 01:38:22.210]  someone just you just asked, Brian,
[01:38:22.210 --> 01:38:23.690]  if we still have blue dream around
[01:38:24.010 --> 01:38:25.970]  that, you know, it's I'm sure people
[01:38:25.970 --> 01:38:27.970]  do, but it's not out of the realm
[01:38:27.970 --> 01:38:29.570]  of possibility that it just falls
[01:38:29.570 --> 01:38:30.650]  off the face of the planet.
[01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:35.840]  Right on. And I feel like, you know,
[01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:37.880]  getting these full expressions,
[01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:40.080]  I wanted to get into more of like it
[01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:42.040]  seems like you're really
[01:38:42.040 --> 01:38:44.000]  understanding IMOs and
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.160]  some of the, you know, creating IMOs.
[01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:48.680]  There was a IMO collection photo that
[01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:50.040]  really stood out for me, Peter.
[01:38:50.040 --> 01:38:51.880]  That was February 13th.
[01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:55.280]  Twenty twenty and
[01:38:55.680 --> 01:38:57.320]  September 6th, twenty twenty.
[01:38:58.120 --> 01:38:59.720]  But I feel like, man, there's is
[01:38:59.720 --> 01:39:01.360]  there something that it seems like
[01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:02.840]  when when a lot of people try to get
[01:39:02.840 --> 01:39:04.000]  into that, they just don't have that
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:05.320]  same success that you're at.
[01:39:05.320 --> 01:39:06.920]  And again, maybe that's kudos to where
[01:39:06.920 --> 01:39:09.080]  you're at, but it
[01:39:09.080 --> 01:39:10.080]  is a lot harder.
[01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:11.360]  It seems like especially in Denver,
[01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:12.600]  unless you put in the time and the
[01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:14.560]  commitment to going up deep
[01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:16.280]  into the mountains, it's really hard
[01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:17.640]  to get anything that seems like it's
[01:39:17.640 --> 01:39:19.320]  worthwhile, worth the effort
[01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:21.080]  when you can just kind of sit at home
[01:39:21.080 --> 01:39:23.200]  and maybe make some actively aerated
[01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:24.960]  compost teas from really high compost
[01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:25.960]  from a buddy.
[01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:30.120]  So there is, I
[01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:31.920]  feel like a lot of nuances that
[01:39:32.680 --> 01:39:34.360]  they kind of get passed up just
[01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:36.640]  because it was so regional,
[01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:38.520]  the IMO and actually Korean natural
[01:39:38.520 --> 01:39:40.200]  farming and originated in Korea
[01:39:40.520 --> 01:39:42.000]  and then it kind of went over to
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.000]  Hawaii.
[01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:45.200]  So a lot of the techniques as
[01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:47.080]  far as collecting IMO, it's not
[01:39:47.080 --> 01:39:48.760]  like a one size fits all
[01:39:49.480 --> 01:39:51.520]  thing where the common adage
[01:39:51.520 --> 01:39:53.080]  is undercooked rice.
[01:39:54.760 --> 01:39:56.800]  I feel like in Hawaii there is a major
[01:39:56.800 --> 01:39:58.440]  benefit to that because it's the
[01:39:58.440 --> 01:40:00.720]  jungle. It's humid, really humid
[01:40:01.080 --> 01:40:01.960]  in Humboldt.
[01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:02.960]  It's dry.
[01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:05.400]  So, you know,
[01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:07.680]  I just kind of started
[01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:09.000]  experimenting with different
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:10.480]  consistencies and different
[01:40:11.440 --> 01:40:13.040]  different levels of cooking the rice.
[01:40:13.480 --> 01:40:15.880]  And what I notice is in Humboldt
[01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:16.880]  in the summertime,
[01:40:18.520 --> 01:40:19.920]  thoroughly cooked rice
[01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:22.120]  like a palatable, how you'd serve it
[01:40:22.120 --> 01:40:24.600]  at the table does really well for
[01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:26.440]  for getting collections
[01:40:28.240 --> 01:40:29.760]  versus, yeah, in Hawaii I was
[01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:32.080]  actually I think the one in question
[01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:33.080]  on
[01:40:33.160 --> 01:40:34.160]  a
[01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:37.320]  February, I think it was the 14th.
[01:40:37.680 --> 01:40:39.600]  I think as I remember that was
[01:40:40.240 --> 01:40:41.720]  that was in.
[01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:44.680]  I was in Hawaii and it was Master
[01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:46.720]  Cho's birthday and
[01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:48.320]  I got that collection and I was like,
[01:40:48.320 --> 01:40:50.400]  what a nice what a nice like
[01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:52.240]  day to get this beautiful collection
[01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:53.240]  in Hawaii.
[01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:55.880]  So so this is the February 14th
[01:40:55.880 --> 01:40:57.320]  2020 picture
[01:40:58.040 --> 01:40:59.480]  and then the one right.
[01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:01.080]  Well, actually, let me go this way.
[01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:04.120]  This is February 22nd.
[01:41:11.110 --> 01:41:12.110]  How did I just lose?
[01:41:12.150 --> 01:41:13.990]  I think if you go up further,
[01:41:14.270 --> 01:41:15.150]  you know what I think?
[01:41:15.150 --> 01:41:16.150]  I think I got the date.
[01:41:16.190 --> 01:41:17.830]  The last date. It's 2020.
[01:41:18.110 --> 01:41:19.830]  February 13th, 2020.
[01:41:20.230 --> 01:41:21.230]  Sorry about that.
[01:41:22.270 --> 01:41:23.750]  Yeah. So if you go up a little bit
[01:41:23.750 --> 01:41:25.670]  more, you'll see
[01:41:25.670 --> 01:41:26.830]  it in there. It's just a white,
[01:41:26.830 --> 01:41:29.030]  fluffy, beautiful cloud.
[01:41:29.070 --> 01:41:30.950]  Definitely my best collection ever.
[01:41:32.870 --> 01:41:34.270]  And yeah. Yeah. There's a lot of just
[01:41:34.270 --> 01:41:35.590]  kind of playing around
[01:41:36.510 --> 01:41:37.790]  with the consistency, with the
[01:41:37.790 --> 01:41:38.790]  location.
[01:41:39.110 --> 01:41:40.910]  And, you know, something that
[01:41:40.990 --> 01:41:42.870]  I I feel like it really could be a
[01:41:42.870 --> 01:41:44.510]  benefit to people if they're having
[01:41:45.350 --> 01:41:47.430]  repetitive failures is
[01:41:47.430 --> 01:41:49.430]  go find some some leaf mold.
[01:41:50.630 --> 01:41:52.510]  Go get a little scoop of soil
[01:41:53.070 --> 01:41:55.070]  and put this in a container and
[01:41:55.070 --> 01:41:57.190]  then put it in a especially
[01:41:57.190 --> 01:41:59.070]  if you're in the city and put
[01:41:59.070 --> 01:42:00.910]  it in like a, you know, a five
[01:42:00.910 --> 01:42:02.470]  gallon bucket or something and have
[01:42:02.470 --> 01:42:04.310]  the soil, have the leaf mold,
[01:42:04.510 --> 01:42:05.990]  have your collection box and then
[01:42:05.990 --> 01:42:07.550]  add more leaf mold to the top.
[01:42:07.910 --> 01:42:08.950]  And then you're in this kind of
[01:42:08.950 --> 01:42:10.350]  controlled environment
[01:42:11.110 --> 01:42:12.830]  where you can get this consistency
[01:42:13.150 --> 01:42:14.150]  and you could start to see
[01:42:14.150 --> 01:42:15.790]  successes. Because another thing,
[01:42:15.790 --> 01:42:17.750]  too, is, yeah, depending
[01:42:17.750 --> 01:42:19.510]  on the temperature at night, the
[01:42:19.510 --> 01:42:21.310]  humidity, where the box is,
[01:42:21.310 --> 01:42:22.310]  how you cook the rice.
[01:42:22.910 --> 01:42:24.790]  It could take three days in
[01:42:24.790 --> 01:42:26.270]  the summertime or two days.
[01:42:26.630 --> 01:42:27.590]  And then in the wintertime, it
[01:42:27.590 --> 01:42:28.830]  could take two weeks.
[01:42:30.470 --> 01:42:31.790]  So it's yeah, there's so many
[01:42:31.870 --> 01:42:33.470]  variables and it gets it can be
[01:42:33.470 --> 01:42:34.470]  discouraging.
[01:42:34.550 --> 01:42:35.790]  You know, I actually I
[01:42:37.070 --> 01:42:38.950]  was talking with a guy in the
[01:42:39.510 --> 01:42:40.790]  Korean Natural Farming Facebook
[01:42:40.790 --> 01:42:43.110]  group and this guy had like 20
[01:42:43.110 --> 01:42:44.270]  failed collections.
[01:42:45.270 --> 01:42:47.030]  I was amazed that he was he was
[01:42:47.030 --> 01:42:49.070]  still persistent in trying
[01:42:49.070 --> 01:42:51.190]  to make it happen because, yeah,
[01:42:51.190 --> 01:42:51.950]  it was discouraging.
[01:42:51.950 --> 01:42:53.350]  And he just kept trying and trying.
[01:42:53.350 --> 01:42:55.230]  And finally, he was able to get
[01:42:55.230 --> 01:42:56.230]  a good collection.
[01:42:57.670 --> 01:42:59.350]  And yeah, so I think that having
[01:42:59.350 --> 01:43:01.110]  that kind of even as just a
[01:43:01.110 --> 01:43:02.630]  starter for your first, you know,
[01:43:02.630 --> 01:43:03.950]  a couple of if you fail a few
[01:43:03.950 --> 01:43:05.790]  times and try to do something in a
[01:43:05.790 --> 01:43:07.270]  controlled environment where you
[01:43:07.270 --> 01:43:08.510]  can start to monitor it
[01:43:09.310 --> 01:43:10.950]  and take notes on
[01:43:12.030 --> 01:43:13.750]  because, yeah, there is it depends
[01:43:13.750 --> 01:43:15.110]  on where you are. People will tell
[01:43:15.110 --> 01:43:16.870]  you it takes three days or five
[01:43:16.870 --> 01:43:17.870]  days.
[01:43:17.990 --> 01:43:18.990]  You don't know.
[01:43:19.110 --> 01:43:20.270]  You don't know where that person's
[01:43:20.270 --> 01:43:22.270]  at. They're in Florida or
[01:43:22.270 --> 01:43:23.670]  they're in Hawaii or
[01:43:24.430 --> 01:43:25.990]  you know, super high desert
[01:43:26.830 --> 01:43:27.830]  mountain area.
[01:43:28.390 --> 01:43:30.990]  So, yeah, it's definitely,
[01:43:30.990 --> 01:43:33.110]  you know, I've had more successes
[01:43:33.110 --> 01:43:34.830]  than failures, but it really is.
[01:43:34.830 --> 01:43:36.630]  It's a it's a tricky game because
[01:43:36.630 --> 01:43:38.510]  it's, you know, it's so many
[01:43:38.510 --> 01:43:40.630]  variables and it's never
[01:43:40.630 --> 01:43:42.270]  going to be the exact same.
[01:43:44.110 --> 01:43:45.630]  Do you feel like especially for a
[01:43:45.630 --> 01:43:46.990]  beginner that they should look at it
[01:43:46.990 --> 01:43:48.430]  almost like baseball stats.
[01:43:48.430 --> 01:43:49.790]  So if they're hitting three out of
[01:43:49.790 --> 01:43:51.870]  10, then they're doing pretty well.
[01:43:53.550 --> 01:43:54.710]  Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[01:43:54.710 --> 01:43:55.950]  I mean, I wouldn't get discouraged
[01:43:55.950 --> 01:43:56.990]  with that if you get a good
[01:43:56.990 --> 01:43:59.030]  collection, that's
[01:43:59.030 --> 01:44:00.030]  a that's great.
[01:44:00.030 --> 01:44:02.150]  And yeah, just keep trying because
[01:44:02.150 --> 01:44:03.710]  you will get better over time
[01:44:04.910 --> 01:44:06.230]  where it's like, you know, at first
[01:44:06.230 --> 01:44:07.750]  I get like one good collection out
[01:44:07.750 --> 01:44:09.550]  of every five and now it's like I
[01:44:09.550 --> 01:44:11.030]  can throw them out and it's, you
[01:44:11.030 --> 01:44:13.230]  know, the majority of the time
[01:44:13.230 --> 01:44:14.510]  I'm getting good collections.
[01:44:15.830 --> 01:44:17.190]  Certainly it's called experience.
[01:44:17.190 --> 01:44:18.910]  You know, yes, it's
[01:44:19.270 --> 01:44:20.270]  here. Right.
[01:44:20.470 --> 01:44:21.990]  There's no substitute for it.
[01:44:22.430 --> 01:44:23.750]  And I love what you said.
[01:44:23.750 --> 01:44:25.710]  I mean, that was so spot on.
[01:44:25.710 --> 01:44:27.150]  And so you really have to take your
[01:44:27.150 --> 01:44:28.550]  environment into consideration.
[01:44:28.990 --> 01:44:30.510]  Like if you're in a wet environment,
[01:44:30.510 --> 01:44:32.350]  drier rice, drier
[01:44:32.350 --> 01:44:33.990]  environment, wetter rice, you know,
[01:44:33.990 --> 01:44:35.910]  all these all these types or vice
[01:44:35.910 --> 01:44:37.310]  versa, all these types of
[01:44:38.070 --> 01:44:38.830]  scenarios.
[01:44:38.830 --> 01:44:40.830]  And the other that coin is, too, is
[01:44:40.830 --> 01:44:42.590]  that you got to know where to put
[01:44:42.590 --> 01:44:43.590]  the damn box.
[01:44:44.510 --> 01:44:45.470]  Right.
[01:44:45.470 --> 01:44:47.190]  That's probably three quarters of
[01:44:47.190 --> 01:44:49.190]  the battle is really understanding,
[01:44:49.550 --> 01:44:51.430]  you know, the best environment
[01:44:51.430 --> 01:44:52.910]  to put it in. And just because
[01:44:52.910 --> 01:44:54.550]  there's some leaves piled up doesn't
[01:44:54.550 --> 01:44:56.350]  mean that there's going to be that's
[01:44:56.350 --> 01:44:57.710]  the ideal collection spot.
[01:44:58.310 --> 01:45:00.310]  So a lot of nuances, like you said,
[01:45:00.310 --> 01:45:01.750]  and I love the idea of doing
[01:45:02.230 --> 01:45:03.230]  an indoor one.
[01:45:03.230 --> 01:45:04.830]  So bring me bring the outdoors,
[01:45:04.830 --> 01:45:06.790]  indoors, where you have a better
[01:45:06.790 --> 01:45:08.070]  chance of success.
[01:45:08.870 --> 01:45:10.590]  If you especially if you're in like
[01:45:10.590 --> 01:45:12.470]  an environment that has huge swings,
[01:45:12.470 --> 01:45:14.270]  whether they're temperature or
[01:45:14.270 --> 01:45:16.430]  humidity or or sunlight, whatever.
[01:45:17.110 --> 01:45:18.110]  Great advice.
[01:45:18.110 --> 01:45:19.110]  Great.
[01:45:19.830 --> 01:45:21.270]  And something, too, that I really
[01:45:21.270 --> 01:45:22.270]  have been recently
[01:45:23.230 --> 01:45:24.710]  gravitating towards instead of a
[01:45:24.710 --> 01:45:26.590]  traditional IMO pile
[01:45:26.710 --> 01:45:28.670]  is just a mesothermic
[01:45:28.670 --> 01:45:30.670]  compost pile with
[01:45:30.670 --> 01:45:31.670]  local plants thrown
[01:45:32.710 --> 01:45:34.590]  in the mix and and
[01:45:34.590 --> 01:45:35.590]  some leaf mold.
[01:45:35.750 --> 01:45:37.350]  And I feel like that I've had
[01:45:37.350 --> 01:45:39.470]  amazing, amazing visible
[01:45:39.470 --> 01:45:41.670]  biology where there's like mushrooms
[01:45:41.670 --> 01:45:43.310]  growing on the outside of the pile
[01:45:43.390 --> 01:45:44.670]  as I'm making it.
[01:45:45.470 --> 01:45:46.790]  So, you know, there's a lot of
[01:45:46.790 --> 01:45:48.310]  different ways to incorporate
[01:45:48.750 --> 01:45:50.110]  biology in your grow.
[01:45:50.110 --> 01:45:52.030]  I think the really important thing
[01:45:52.030 --> 01:45:54.030]  is that you are incorporating
[01:45:54.030 --> 01:45:55.310]  if you're growing organically,
[01:45:55.590 --> 01:45:57.510]  incorporate biology because it's it
[01:45:57.510 --> 01:45:58.950]  really is going to step your whole
[01:45:58.950 --> 01:46:00.870]  game up as opposed to just using,
[01:46:00.870 --> 01:46:02.070]  you know, dry amendments
[01:46:02.990 --> 01:46:03.990]  by themselves.
[01:46:05.350 --> 01:46:06.390]  You know, that's the biggest
[01:46:06.390 --> 01:46:08.070]  misnomer on dry amendments.
[01:46:08.110 --> 01:46:10.270]  If you don't have high biology,
[01:46:10.350 --> 01:46:11.350]  you're not going to get them
[01:46:11.350 --> 01:46:12.350]  broken down.
[01:46:12.430 --> 01:46:13.790]  I mean, that was the trick of all
[01:46:13.790 --> 01:46:15.510]  the farmers and the hippies back in
[01:46:15.510 --> 01:46:17.150]  the day was, you know, they are.
[01:46:17.150 --> 01:46:18.030]  They would use all these
[01:46:18.030 --> 01:46:19.830]  amendments. They'd let it cook down.
[01:46:20.150 --> 01:46:21.990]  But they were all about adding tea
[01:46:21.990 --> 01:46:23.750]  and after they built the soil,
[01:46:23.750 --> 01:46:24.750]  the super soil.
[01:46:25.070 --> 01:46:26.510]  So, you know, that's that right
[01:46:26.510 --> 01:46:27.510]  there spot on.
[01:46:28.430 --> 01:46:30.150]  And I love your I love your cool
[01:46:30.150 --> 01:46:31.110]  composting.
[01:46:31.110 --> 01:46:32.390]  That's another great trick that
[01:46:32.390 --> 01:46:33.350]  anybody can do.
[01:46:33.350 --> 01:46:34.870]  And it's not complicated.
[01:46:35.150 --> 01:46:36.510]  It's just a matter of harvesting
[01:46:36.510 --> 01:46:38.070]  those tender little greens around
[01:46:38.070 --> 01:46:39.150]  wherever you are.
[01:46:39.590 --> 01:46:41.390]  Diversity, diversity, diversity.
[01:46:41.390 --> 01:46:42.470]  Same with the Browns.
[01:46:42.750 --> 01:46:44.470]  And, yeah, you'll see all kinds of
[01:46:44.470 --> 01:46:45.630]  goodies come out of it and then
[01:46:45.630 --> 01:46:47.150]  bring the bring the leaf mold to you
[01:46:47.150 --> 01:46:48.990]  and even better inoculate it.
[01:46:49.030 --> 01:46:50.230]  You know, put some fish brew in
[01:46:50.230 --> 01:46:52.390]  there or a kelp ferment
[01:46:52.390 --> 01:46:54.270]  in there to really start
[01:46:54.310 --> 01:46:56.670]  that that jumpstart the biological
[01:46:56.670 --> 01:46:58.470]  processes from getting
[01:46:58.470 --> 01:46:59.470]  them really going.
[01:47:00.550 --> 01:47:02.470]  Great. It's very rare for me,
[01:47:02.470 --> 01:47:04.350]  Johnny, to see people outside of,
[01:47:04.470 --> 01:47:06.270]  you know, the tried and true
[01:47:06.270 --> 01:47:07.830]  ones that are teaching the subject
[01:47:08.110 --> 01:47:09.750]  to get that fluffiness and that
[01:47:09.750 --> 01:47:11.110]  color that you got on there.
[01:47:11.470 --> 01:47:12.950]  I just I just feel like
[01:47:13.390 --> 01:47:14.830]  it almost in a way seems like you
[01:47:14.830 --> 01:47:16.310]  can kind of get one or the other.
[01:47:16.310 --> 01:47:17.910]  So for you to get both, obviously
[01:47:17.910 --> 01:47:19.870]  that's that's got to be a next level
[01:47:19.870 --> 01:47:20.870]  collection. And
[01:47:22.030 --> 01:47:23.790]  are there any little extra tidbits
[01:47:23.830 --> 01:47:25.270]  you can kind of give the audience so
[01:47:25.270 --> 01:47:26.910]  that they can potentially get that?
[01:47:26.910 --> 01:47:28.590]  I know it might always kind of come
[01:47:28.790 --> 01:47:30.590]  down to the location, but if there's
[01:47:30.590 --> 01:47:32.110]  like a certain things like a lot
[01:47:32.510 --> 01:47:33.150]  of people, I feel like they're
[01:47:33.150 --> 01:47:34.510]  learning more about leaf litter and
[01:47:34.510 --> 01:47:35.510]  that kind of thing.
[01:47:36.470 --> 01:47:38.510]  Yeah, so like you said,
[01:47:38.510 --> 01:47:40.430]  location and environment
[01:47:40.430 --> 01:47:42.430]  and there's the way it's
[01:47:42.430 --> 01:47:43.790]  taught to get collections is.
[01:47:44.830 --> 01:47:46.550]  Don't peek, you know, don't look at
[01:47:46.550 --> 01:47:47.670]  it until you're ready to go.
[01:47:48.950 --> 01:47:51.230]  But as far as taking
[01:47:51.230 --> 01:47:53.150]  the time and opportunity to learn,
[01:47:53.470 --> 01:47:55.190]  it might not be a bad idea
[01:47:55.550 --> 01:47:56.990]  just to set a box out
[01:47:57.470 --> 01:47:58.950]  and just you don't even have to
[01:47:58.950 --> 01:48:00.310]  incorporate it. You can throw it in a
[01:48:00.310 --> 01:48:01.990]  compost pile after and just take
[01:48:01.990 --> 01:48:03.830]  notes and be like, oh, this took four
[01:48:03.830 --> 01:48:04.590]  days.
[01:48:04.590 --> 01:48:06.430]  It was this time of year.
[01:48:06.790 --> 01:48:08.790]  I put it in this location and
[01:48:08.790 --> 01:48:10.590]  there's nothing nothing a little
[01:48:10.590 --> 01:48:13.270]  peek or also using a particular
[01:48:13.270 --> 01:48:14.590]  what your collection or your
[01:48:14.590 --> 01:48:15.910]  collection is going to be placed in
[01:48:16.430 --> 01:48:17.990]  like that one that I had in Hawaii
[01:48:17.990 --> 01:48:19.030]  that super fluffy one.
[01:48:19.030 --> 01:48:20.510]  That's a hollow basket.
[01:48:20.550 --> 01:48:22.070]  So it's like a woven grass.
[01:48:22.590 --> 01:48:24.310]  And that thing you can lift up
[01:48:24.630 --> 01:48:25.990]  and you could look at the bottom of
[01:48:25.990 --> 01:48:28.030]  it and you could see mycelium
[01:48:28.030 --> 01:48:30.110]  on it. So I mean, that's a huge
[01:48:30.110 --> 01:48:31.150]  thing. You don't even have to open
[01:48:31.150 --> 01:48:32.550]  the box up. You can just see the
[01:48:32.550 --> 01:48:33.550]  activity
[01:48:34.910 --> 01:48:36.470]  right on the box without even
[01:48:36.470 --> 01:48:37.870]  disturbing the collection really
[01:48:37.870 --> 01:48:39.190]  besides just kind of lifting up the
[01:48:39.190 --> 01:48:40.870]  corner of it and just yeah, it's
[01:48:40.870 --> 01:48:41.870]  like there it is.
[01:48:41.990 --> 01:48:43.990]  You see that white fluffy stuff
[01:48:43.990 --> 01:48:45.830]  taking over your hollow basket
[01:48:45.830 --> 01:48:47.830]  or whatever and you know, there's
[01:48:47.830 --> 01:48:48.910]  a really good sign.
[01:48:49.470 --> 01:48:51.710]  Another little nuanced technique
[01:48:51.950 --> 01:48:54.070]  is you can feel it lift the box
[01:48:54.070 --> 01:48:55.590]  up, put your hand on the ground.
[01:48:56.870 --> 01:48:58.550]  If there is activity, you're going
[01:48:58.550 --> 01:49:00.230]  to feel some ambient temperature
[01:49:00.550 --> 01:49:02.070]  that are the ambient temperature is
[01:49:02.070 --> 01:49:02.950]  going to be warmer than the
[01:49:02.950 --> 01:49:03.950]  surrounding air.
[01:49:04.710 --> 01:49:06.470]  You can feel the biology going to
[01:49:06.470 --> 01:49:07.470]  work in there.
[01:49:09.430 --> 01:49:11.630]  Right on to the audience.
[01:49:12.070 --> 01:49:13.110]  Again, a lot of these people are
[01:49:13.110 --> 01:49:14.670]  kind of learning new terminology and
[01:49:14.670 --> 01:49:16.430]  stuff and they wanted you to define
[01:49:16.430 --> 01:49:17.670]  mesophilic, please.
[01:49:18.830 --> 01:49:20.630]  So that's essentially just keeping
[01:49:21.430 --> 01:49:23.670]  keeping the pile under 120 degrees
[01:49:24.870 --> 01:49:26.710]  and you can keep the pile
[01:49:26.710 --> 01:49:28.910]  under 120 degrees or keep it around
[01:49:28.910 --> 01:49:30.030]  120 degrees.
[01:49:31.190 --> 01:49:33.110]  You could thin the pile out and
[01:49:33.110 --> 01:49:35.070]  make it, you know, reduce the height
[01:49:35.070 --> 01:49:37.430]  of it, turn the pile.
[01:49:37.670 --> 01:49:39.430]  That's a great way to reduce the heat
[01:49:39.470 --> 01:49:41.270]  and like reduce it and just kind of
[01:49:41.270 --> 01:49:41.950]  to monitor it.
[01:49:41.990 --> 01:49:43.910]  You know, I really I when I'm
[01:49:43.910 --> 01:49:45.470]  making a pile, I'll check on it,
[01:49:45.990 --> 01:49:48.230]  you know, a few times a day.
[01:49:48.470 --> 01:49:50.070]  You know, I won't go too far.
[01:49:50.910 --> 01:49:53.150]  And it's that process of mesothermic
[01:49:53.150 --> 01:49:55.150]  composting is essentially what
[01:49:55.150 --> 01:49:57.230]  you're doing with making an IMO
[01:49:57.230 --> 01:49:58.230]  pile.
[01:49:58.230 --> 01:50:00.190]  You're monitoring the temperature,
[01:50:00.230 --> 01:50:02.310]  you're keeping it at 120
[01:50:02.310 --> 01:50:04.590]  degrees or less and you're turning
[01:50:04.590 --> 01:50:06.110]  it when it gets to be more than that.
[01:50:06.190 --> 01:50:07.190]  And.
[01:50:08.390 --> 01:50:10.270]  So, yeah, it's essentially,
[01:50:11.590 --> 01:50:13.870]  you know, that those conditions allow
[01:50:13.870 --> 01:50:15.190]  for fungal growth.
[01:50:16.030 --> 01:50:17.270]  They won't cook off some of the
[01:50:17.270 --> 01:50:19.630]  biology. So you'll get that diversity
[01:50:19.870 --> 01:50:21.110]  as opposed to doing like a hot
[01:50:21.110 --> 01:50:22.790]  compost, which, you know, you're
[01:50:22.790 --> 01:50:24.710]  going to be up, I think, 160
[01:50:24.710 --> 01:50:26.510]  degrees or so and you're going to be
[01:50:26.510 --> 01:50:27.990]  turning it. And that's a good way to
[01:50:27.990 --> 01:50:29.990]  sterilize and
[01:50:29.990 --> 01:50:31.710]  in to kill weed seeds.
[01:50:31.990 --> 01:50:33.270]  But as far as the app for your
[01:50:33.270 --> 01:50:35.070]  biology, I think a mesothermic
[01:50:35.070 --> 01:50:37.430]  compost is really like a great,
[01:50:37.550 --> 01:50:39.310]  great tool for people to incorporate
[01:50:39.310 --> 01:50:40.310]  into their garden.
[01:50:43.960 --> 01:50:45.800]  Yeah. So can
[01:50:45.800 --> 01:50:47.280]  you kind of define why you didn't use
[01:50:47.280 --> 01:50:48.280]  a cedar box?
[01:50:48.720 --> 01:50:50.040]  I think that's kind of where the
[01:50:50.040 --> 01:50:51.040]  challenge right now.
[01:50:51.640 --> 01:50:54.440]  That is, you know, that's traditional.
[01:50:54.640 --> 01:50:56.400]  But, you know, I mean, the teachings
[01:50:56.400 --> 01:50:58.480]  have it's there are so many
[01:50:58.480 --> 01:50:59.480]  ways to do it.
[01:50:59.480 --> 01:51:01.640]  The hollow baskets in Hawaii got
[01:51:01.640 --> 01:51:03.800]  the show, the master show
[01:51:03.800 --> 01:51:04.880]  not of approval.
[01:51:05.120 --> 01:51:06.920]  People will get bamboo
[01:51:07.280 --> 01:51:09.320]  and cut it in half and
[01:51:09.320 --> 01:51:11.240]  drill some holes in it and they'll
[01:51:11.240 --> 01:51:12.920]  do collections and they'll tie the
[01:51:12.920 --> 01:51:14.240]  bamboo together, put the rice in
[01:51:14.240 --> 01:51:16.520]  there, tie it together and collect
[01:51:16.520 --> 01:51:18.640]  a map. So there's a lot of different
[01:51:18.920 --> 01:51:19.840]  you want to use something that's
[01:51:19.840 --> 01:51:20.840]  natural.
[01:51:20.880 --> 01:51:22.200]  That's one of the things with natural
[01:51:22.200 --> 01:51:23.200]  farming.
[01:51:24.200 --> 01:51:25.400]  You know, there is this kind of
[01:51:25.400 --> 01:51:27.360]  dogma and rigidness to
[01:51:27.360 --> 01:51:28.360]  it. If you look
[01:51:29.320 --> 01:51:31.080]  at it too literally.
[01:51:31.320 --> 01:51:33.320]  But in reality, you're you really
[01:51:33.320 --> 01:51:35.320]  want to use what's natural and what's
[01:51:35.440 --> 01:51:36.480]  available to you.
[01:51:36.520 --> 01:51:38.640]  Like this system wasn't designed for.
[01:51:40.600 --> 01:51:42.600]  It was designed for poor farmers.
[01:51:43.080 --> 01:51:45.080]  So, you know, if there's no cedar
[01:51:45.080 --> 01:51:46.720]  in your area or you don't have access
[01:51:46.720 --> 01:51:48.400]  to it or all you have access to is
[01:51:48.680 --> 01:51:51.000]  bamboo or hollow woven grass
[01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:52.640]  basket, you know, use it.
[01:51:54.360 --> 01:51:56.480]  Drake, one of the, you know, kind
[01:51:56.480 --> 01:51:58.320]  of original
[01:51:58.880 --> 01:52:00.440]  teachers of Korean natural farming in
[01:52:00.440 --> 01:52:02.480]  the United States, what he was studied
[01:52:02.480 --> 01:52:04.440]  under Master Cho, he has a rule called
[01:52:04.440 --> 01:52:06.520]  Rule Zero and Rule Zero
[01:52:06.520 --> 01:52:08.800]  is, you know, just do
[01:52:08.800 --> 01:52:10.520]  it. Just get out there and do it like,
[01:52:10.680 --> 01:52:12.760]  you know, if if you have to, you
[01:52:12.760 --> 01:52:14.440]  know, go against some of the
[01:52:14.960 --> 01:52:16.960]  traditional practice to get
[01:52:16.960 --> 01:52:18.320]  going and dip your feet in.
[01:52:19.040 --> 01:52:21.160]  Start, you know, don't let that hold
[01:52:21.160 --> 01:52:22.160]  you back.
[01:52:23.200 --> 01:52:25.320]  But cedar is a great thing to make
[01:52:25.400 --> 01:52:26.360]  boxes out of.
[01:52:26.360 --> 01:52:28.160]  It's a great thing to make raised beds
[01:52:28.160 --> 01:52:29.520]  out of because it doesn't
[01:52:30.440 --> 01:52:31.840]  it doesn't really succumb to
[01:52:31.840 --> 01:52:32.840]  microbial
[01:52:34.680 --> 01:52:35.440]  activity.
[01:52:35.440 --> 01:52:37.440]  It has a long, long
[01:52:37.440 --> 01:52:39.400]  lifespan and it's going to have
[01:52:39.400 --> 01:52:41.040]  a lot of resistance to
[01:52:41.680 --> 01:52:43.800]  being broken down by microbes.
[01:52:43.800 --> 01:52:45.480]  So that's kind of where that logic
[01:52:45.480 --> 01:52:46.240]  comes from.
[01:52:46.240 --> 01:52:47.880]  Whereas a hollow grass basket,
[01:52:48.280 --> 01:52:49.560]  you know, after a couple of years,
[01:52:49.560 --> 01:52:51.200]  that thing, you know, it's going to
[01:52:51.200 --> 01:52:52.240]  it's time for a new one.
[01:52:55.110 --> 01:52:56.630]  And and do you feel like you're
[01:52:56.630 --> 01:52:58.390]  having success, obviously, where your
[01:52:58.390 --> 01:53:00.230]  location is, but also maybe because
[01:53:00.230 --> 01:53:02.230]  you aren't using that and you're just
[01:53:02.670 --> 01:53:04.710]  kind of using the basket instead
[01:53:04.710 --> 01:53:06.190]  and you just feel like with that,
[01:53:06.270 --> 01:53:08.230]  you're seeing kind of this fluffiness
[01:53:08.230 --> 01:53:09.870]  and whiteness because of that method
[01:53:09.870 --> 01:53:11.910]  or it's just you would see the same
[01:53:11.910 --> 01:53:12.990]  results with cedar.
[01:53:14.710 --> 01:53:15.870]  You know, you can get the same with
[01:53:15.870 --> 01:53:18.070]  cedar. The first the first box
[01:53:18.070 --> 01:53:19.710]  I ever made, this thing was an
[01:53:19.710 --> 01:53:20.710]  abomination.
[01:53:20.950 --> 01:53:22.830]  It was made out of like some two by
[01:53:22.830 --> 01:53:23.550]  four pieces.
[01:53:23.550 --> 01:53:24.830]  It was it's heavy as hell.
[01:53:25.070 --> 01:53:26.510]  Carrying it around in the woods is
[01:53:26.510 --> 01:53:28.430]  like, you know, horrible to do.
[01:53:28.430 --> 01:53:29.430]  It's super heavy.
[01:53:29.590 --> 01:53:31.070]  And I've gotten great collections in
[01:53:31.070 --> 01:53:32.950]  that. You know, I've gotten good
[01:53:32.950 --> 01:53:35.110]  collections with the hollow baskets
[01:53:35.110 --> 01:53:36.950]  with other collection boxes.
[01:53:37.350 --> 01:53:39.350]  I've even you know, this is going
[01:53:39.350 --> 01:53:41.110]  to probably get me slapped by, you
[01:53:41.110 --> 01:53:42.270]  know, one of my mentors.
[01:53:42.270 --> 01:53:44.590]  But I've even got a frickin smart
[01:53:44.590 --> 01:53:46.550]  pot and cooked rice and I
[01:53:46.550 --> 01:53:48.350]  frickin folded it up, stapled it
[01:53:48.350 --> 01:53:50.150]  shut and put that out and gotten
[01:53:50.150 --> 01:53:52.030]  collections in that, which that's not
[01:53:52.030 --> 01:53:53.030]  a natural material.
[01:53:53.030 --> 01:53:54.310]  And I wouldn't advise people to
[01:53:54.310 --> 01:53:55.150]  really go into that.
[01:53:55.150 --> 01:53:56.830]  But, you know, there's a lot of
[01:53:56.830 --> 01:53:57.830]  possibilities.
[01:53:58.510 --> 01:53:59.670]  You guys are always talking with
[01:53:59.670 --> 01:54:00.670]  Marco.
[01:54:01.110 --> 01:54:02.630]  Marco, I've seen him just put
[01:54:02.870 --> 01:54:04.550]  frickin clumps of rice out,
[01:54:04.790 --> 01:54:06.990]  not even have it in a basket and
[01:54:06.990 --> 01:54:08.630]  get collections that were amazing.
[01:54:09.110 --> 01:54:11.070]  So, yeah, don't let don't
[01:54:11.070 --> 01:54:12.550]  let something not having cedar
[01:54:13.550 --> 01:54:15.110]  stop you from going out and trying
[01:54:15.110 --> 01:54:16.110]  to get a collection.
[01:54:16.710 --> 01:54:17.750]  And it's not essential.
[01:54:17.750 --> 01:54:19.190]  You know, you can have success using
[01:54:19.190 --> 01:54:21.270]  all sorts of different, all
[01:54:21.270 --> 01:54:23.110]  sorts of different materials.
[01:54:25.990 --> 01:54:27.230]  Yeah, shout out to Marco.
[01:54:27.230 --> 01:54:28.990]  He's always educating, for sure.
[01:54:30.110 --> 01:54:32.110]  And I always he's one of those
[01:54:32.110 --> 01:54:33.150]  that I feel like his heart is in the
[01:54:33.150 --> 01:54:34.150]  right place.
[01:54:34.150 --> 01:54:35.710]  I feel like Drake was that way, too.
[01:54:35.710 --> 01:54:37.750]  And then for whatever reason, maybe
[01:54:37.830 --> 01:54:39.430]  I don't know what happened, but it
[01:54:39.430 --> 01:54:40.750]  seemed like maybe he just kind of
[01:54:40.750 --> 01:54:42.390]  fell off because he was creating a
[01:54:42.550 --> 01:54:44.470]  lot of the the free stuff
[01:54:44.470 --> 01:54:45.590]  that was out there, all the really
[01:54:45.590 --> 01:54:47.590]  cool infographics I learned later
[01:54:48.110 --> 01:54:49.310]  that I was coming from Drake.
[01:54:49.990 --> 01:54:51.830]  So is there any other
[01:54:51.830 --> 01:54:52.910]  stuff that you felt like you learned
[01:54:52.910 --> 01:54:54.870]  from Drake that might not kind
[01:54:54.870 --> 01:54:56.110]  of maybe have been fallen to the
[01:54:56.110 --> 01:54:57.830]  wayside? Because I feel like
[01:54:57.830 --> 01:54:58.950]  especially on this show, we want to
[01:54:58.950 --> 01:54:59.910]  learn from everybody.
[01:54:59.910 --> 01:55:01.670]  And sometimes in the
[01:55:01.670 --> 01:55:03.110]  in certain nuances,
[01:55:04.350 --> 01:55:05.350]  people will be like, well, there's
[01:55:05.350 --> 01:55:06.830]  no reason to learn from that person
[01:55:06.830 --> 01:55:08.430]  because, you know, this person has
[01:55:08.430 --> 01:55:09.270]  beef or whatever.
[01:55:09.270 --> 01:55:11.110]  But I feel like if they're
[01:55:11.110 --> 01:55:12.270]  an educator and they're obviously
[01:55:12.270 --> 01:55:13.630]  putting time and effort into a lot
[01:55:13.630 --> 01:55:15.510]  of the infographics, was there
[01:55:15.510 --> 01:55:17.470]  anything else that stood out from
[01:55:17.670 --> 01:55:19.150]  from Drake's methods?
[01:55:20.950 --> 01:55:23.110]  So, yeah, and I agree,
[01:55:23.110 --> 01:55:25.190]  I think, and I really took it upon
[01:55:25.190 --> 01:55:27.350]  myself to to study under many
[01:55:27.350 --> 01:55:28.350]  of these teachers,
[01:55:29.710 --> 01:55:31.670]  you know, Chris Trump, I have watched
[01:55:31.670 --> 01:55:33.350]  all of his videos, I've taken his
[01:55:33.350 --> 01:55:35.030]  online class, you know, I mean,
[01:55:35.350 --> 01:55:37.390]  me and him go back and forth
[01:55:37.390 --> 01:55:39.310]  and talk on
[01:55:39.310 --> 01:55:41.430]  a on a semi regular basis
[01:55:41.470 --> 01:55:43.230]  and been impressed in not taking
[01:55:43.230 --> 01:55:44.230]  a class with Joe McHale
[01:55:45.110 --> 01:55:47.190]  and and Cheryl
[01:55:47.190 --> 01:55:48.950]  Mendiola, all of these people.
[01:55:49.550 --> 01:55:51.430]  I really think it's
[01:55:51.430 --> 01:55:53.310]  great to have multiple
[01:55:53.310 --> 01:55:54.950]  teachers because you will lose some
[01:55:54.950 --> 01:55:56.110]  some certain things.
[01:55:56.550 --> 01:55:58.310]  And Drake, you know,
[01:55:58.310 --> 01:56:00.030]  one of the things that he kind of he
[01:56:00.350 --> 01:56:02.150]  showed me a great method to
[01:56:03.590 --> 01:56:05.710]  make water soluble calcium phosphate
[01:56:06.590 --> 01:56:08.350]  as far as just his technique, you
[01:56:08.350 --> 01:56:10.470]  know, it's the same principle,
[01:56:10.470 --> 01:56:12.510]  but just how he goes about and does
[01:56:12.510 --> 01:56:13.790]  it, it's just made it really
[01:56:14.430 --> 01:56:15.590]  simple to do.
[01:56:17.070 --> 01:56:18.070]  He really showed
[01:56:19.310 --> 01:56:21.110]  me a lot of of the
[01:56:21.830 --> 01:56:23.710]  the animal husbandry, too.
[01:56:23.950 --> 01:56:26.030]  And I learned a lot of the benefit
[01:56:26.030 --> 01:56:28.270]  of having the animals in your system.
[01:56:29.550 --> 01:56:31.270]  So that was a really special time.
[01:56:31.270 --> 01:56:32.990]  I went out to Hawaii and it was, you
[01:56:32.990 --> 01:56:34.950]  know, peak covid time.
[01:56:35.270 --> 01:56:36.510]  Everybody canceled.
[01:56:36.710 --> 01:56:38.670]  Nobody wanted to travel during covid.
[01:56:39.070 --> 01:56:40.430]  I already bought my tickets.
[01:56:40.430 --> 01:56:42.550]  I already bought my the class.
[01:56:43.110 --> 01:56:44.790]  And I just he was like, hey, man, I'm
[01:56:44.790 --> 01:56:46.030]  sorry I'm going to have to cancel
[01:56:46.030 --> 01:56:47.710]  because everybody's everybody
[01:56:47.710 --> 01:56:49.670]  bailed. I'm like, I just like
[01:56:49.790 --> 01:56:51.350]  come out there still and just, you
[01:56:51.350 --> 01:56:53.350]  know, pick your brain and and, you
[01:56:53.350 --> 01:56:54.910]  know, like you can kind of show me
[01:56:54.910 --> 01:56:56.070]  some of the things that you do.
[01:56:56.430 --> 01:56:58.390]  And I ended up going to Hawaii and I
[01:56:58.390 --> 01:57:00.270]  was the only only student
[01:57:00.270 --> 01:57:02.150]  there, which was really
[01:57:02.150 --> 01:57:03.710]  special. You know, that one on one
[01:57:03.710 --> 01:57:05.870]  experience, something
[01:57:05.870 --> 01:57:07.790]  else that he he kind
[01:57:07.790 --> 01:57:09.630]  of taught. Yeah, just there's so
[01:57:09.630 --> 01:57:11.390]  many little things and everybody
[01:57:11.390 --> 01:57:13.590]  kind of has the same the core
[01:57:13.790 --> 01:57:15.030]  teachings there.
[01:57:15.350 --> 01:57:17.150]  But yeah, just the slight differences
[01:57:17.150 --> 01:57:18.910]  and the little nuances you can pick up
[01:57:18.910 --> 01:57:20.190]  from people. And I just think it's
[01:57:20.190 --> 01:57:21.190]  important to be
[01:57:22.270 --> 01:57:24.670]  to be open to receiving knowledge
[01:57:24.670 --> 01:57:25.790]  and wisdom from
[01:57:27.510 --> 01:57:28.510]  many channels,
[01:57:29.670 --> 01:57:31.310]  you know, and I really try not to
[01:57:31.310 --> 01:57:33.150]  involve myself in any of the
[01:57:33.150 --> 01:57:35.110]  you know, the kind of
[01:57:35.110 --> 01:57:36.990]  drama that certain people
[01:57:36.990 --> 01:57:38.790]  have with each other and give people
[01:57:39.470 --> 01:57:41.350]  the opportunity to kind of share
[01:57:41.350 --> 01:57:43.310]  that knowledge and try
[01:57:43.310 --> 01:57:45.310]  not to try not to go into
[01:57:45.310 --> 01:57:47.350]  situations with a preconceived
[01:57:47.350 --> 01:57:49.590]  notion based
[01:57:49.590 --> 01:57:51.510]  on what someone else is told
[01:57:51.510 --> 01:57:53.470]  me about someone. So, yeah, I
[01:57:53.470 --> 01:57:55.350]  really, really appreciated that
[01:57:55.350 --> 01:57:56.830]  time out there with Drake and
[01:57:59.070 --> 01:58:00.670]  it was just a special time.
[01:58:00.670 --> 01:58:01.830]  Not only did we
[01:58:02.510 --> 01:58:04.150]  did we go over a lot of the Korean
[01:58:04.150 --> 01:58:05.350]  natural farming stuff,
[01:58:05.870 --> 01:58:07.350]  but we really showed me,
[01:58:07.350 --> 01:58:08.350]  you know, he has cows.
[01:58:08.350 --> 01:58:09.910]  I've never, you know, I grew up in
[01:58:09.910 --> 01:58:11.750]  the suburbs. I never had, you know,
[01:58:11.750 --> 01:58:13.630]  livestock and just kind of
[01:58:14.150 --> 01:58:16.150]  going around and doing his daily
[01:58:16.150 --> 01:58:17.670]  things with him, helping him out
[01:58:18.510 --> 01:58:19.870]  was special.
[01:58:19.870 --> 01:58:21.310]  You know, he was one of the first to
[01:58:21.310 --> 01:58:22.310]  study under Master Cho.
[01:58:23.910 --> 01:58:25.830]  I also, you know, I got to hang out
[01:58:25.830 --> 01:58:26.830]  with his family.
[01:58:26.830 --> 01:58:28.910]  Me and his mother, you know, went
[01:58:28.910 --> 01:58:30.870]  out and harvested mugwort
[01:58:31.310 --> 01:58:33.550]  FPJ or to make an FPJ
[01:58:33.550 --> 01:58:34.550]  at Sunrise.
[01:58:34.830 --> 01:58:36.590]  But it was just so such a great
[01:58:36.590 --> 01:58:37.910]  time out there, really.
[01:58:38.750 --> 01:58:40.510]  You know, every day I'd wake up at
[01:58:40.510 --> 01:58:42.190]  five o'clock in the morning, the rain
[01:58:42.190 --> 01:58:43.990]  would stop and I'd walk up about
[01:58:43.990 --> 01:58:45.590]  a mile up the road, go check on the
[01:58:45.590 --> 01:58:47.190]  IMO pile that we started
[01:58:47.990 --> 01:58:49.190]  and just really it was
[01:58:50.310 --> 01:58:51.910]  it was kind of a transitional time
[01:58:51.910 --> 01:58:53.590]  where I had just left the commercial
[01:58:53.590 --> 01:58:54.910]  nursery I was working at.
[01:58:55.430 --> 01:58:56.830]  And it was a nice reset.
[01:58:56.870 --> 01:58:57.870]  And it really
[01:58:58.990 --> 01:59:00.630]  kind of put things in perspective for
[01:59:00.630 --> 01:59:01.630]  me. What I want.
[01:59:01.670 --> 01:59:02.670]  What I want to do.
[01:59:02.710 --> 01:59:03.710]  What I want to do.
[01:59:03.870 --> 01:59:04.870]  What I want to do.
[01:59:04.910 --> 01:59:06.510]  I want to be doing with my time and my
[01:59:06.510 --> 01:59:07.510]  life.
[01:59:08.510 --> 01:59:10.110]  So, yeah, I highly recommend people
[01:59:10.110 --> 01:59:12.150]  just to be open to
[01:59:12.150 --> 01:59:14.190]  to having many masters.
[01:59:16.590 --> 01:59:18.510]  Yeah. And then the whole
[01:59:18.510 --> 01:59:20.070]  point, I feel like that is then you
[01:59:20.070 --> 01:59:21.870]  pick and choose personally, like you
[01:59:21.870 --> 01:59:23.610]  see what you resonate with and then
[01:59:23.830 --> 01:59:25.270]  you rock with that stuff and see if
[01:59:25.270 --> 01:59:26.270]  it's true for yourself.
[01:59:26.590 --> 01:59:28.190]  If it's not, then sometimes you have
[01:59:28.190 --> 01:59:29.790]  to go back to the drawing board.
[01:59:30.510 --> 01:59:31.670]  But I feel like when more and more
[01:59:31.670 --> 01:59:33.510]  people are resonating to something
[01:59:33.510 --> 01:59:35.070]  or again with the infographics, I
[01:59:35.070 --> 01:59:36.470]  feel like that's an easy way,
[01:59:36.670 --> 01:59:37.950]  especially when you're first learning
[01:59:37.950 --> 01:59:40.110]  things to kind of start to visually
[01:59:40.110 --> 01:59:42.030]  see it. And, you know, he had a
[01:59:42.070 --> 01:59:43.590]  unique way of kind of drawing it
[01:59:43.910 --> 01:59:44.990]  with a little heart thing.
[01:59:45.270 --> 01:59:47.190]  And it just kind of I don't
[01:59:47.190 --> 01:59:48.870]  know, man, I never knew really who
[01:59:48.870 --> 01:59:50.350]  that was until later on.
[01:59:50.790 --> 01:59:52.550]  And I feel like more and more people
[01:59:52.550 --> 01:59:53.550]  should check out his
[01:59:54.350 --> 01:59:55.350]  material for sure.
[01:59:56.910 --> 01:59:58.410]  Yeah, for sure, he's an asset to the
[01:59:58.430 --> 02:00:00.270]  community, despite
[02:00:00.270 --> 02:00:02.030]  him kind of kind of disappearing for
[02:00:02.270 --> 02:00:03.870]  a little bit. He's starting to pop up
[02:00:04.510 --> 02:00:06.150]  again in the Korean Natural Farming
[02:00:06.150 --> 02:00:07.150]  Facebook group.
[02:00:07.310 --> 02:00:08.510]  And he has like a
[02:00:09.150 --> 02:00:11.510]  kind of a live ask me anything
[02:00:11.750 --> 02:00:13.910]  type of type of program
[02:00:13.910 --> 02:00:15.350]  that he puts on every now and then
[02:00:15.350 --> 02:00:16.210]  now.
[02:00:16.230 --> 02:00:17.790]  So, yeah, I highly recommend it.
[02:00:17.790 --> 02:00:19.630]  And yeah, I got a lot of history with
[02:00:19.630 --> 02:00:20.630]  with Drake, too.
[02:00:22.230 --> 02:00:23.750]  You know, he kind of
[02:00:24.670 --> 02:00:26.470]  told me like how Korean Natural
[02:00:26.470 --> 02:00:28.830]  Farming, like how it touched down,
[02:00:29.110 --> 02:00:30.910]  how it touched down in this country.
[02:00:30.910 --> 02:00:32.870]  And he even went into
[02:00:32.870 --> 02:00:33.870]  just kind of the JADAM
[02:00:35.550 --> 02:00:36.870]  aspect of it, too,
[02:00:37.430 --> 02:00:39.070]  where he he remembers,
[02:00:39.310 --> 02:00:40.870]  you know, as Master Cho Sung,
[02:00:41.070 --> 02:00:42.150]  Young San Cho
[02:00:42.750 --> 02:00:45.030]  came around in his contributions.
[02:00:46.790 --> 02:00:48.310]  So, yeah, it was really it was
[02:00:48.710 --> 02:00:50.190]  fucking amazing getting
[02:00:50.550 --> 02:00:52.190]  to see that stuff put to practice on
[02:00:52.190 --> 02:00:54.190]  a real farm
[02:00:54.390 --> 02:00:55.390]  type scenario.
[02:00:55.510 --> 02:00:56.510]  And yeah, I think that
[02:00:57.990 --> 02:00:59.590]  I think that these techniques really
[02:00:59.590 --> 02:01:01.190]  like with the way things are in the
[02:01:01.190 --> 02:01:02.510]  market and how
[02:01:04.310 --> 02:01:06.150]  how the price is so bottomed out
[02:01:06.270 --> 02:01:07.910]  and how expensive it is
[02:01:08.150 --> 02:01:09.750]  to be a cannabis grower with all the
[02:01:09.750 --> 02:01:11.310]  inputs, learning these natural
[02:01:11.630 --> 02:01:12.830]  farming techniques and JADAM
[02:01:12.830 --> 02:01:14.190]  techniques can really
[02:01:15.030 --> 02:01:16.750]  help people in their bottom line.
[02:01:18.590 --> 02:01:20.310]  Yeah, one of the guys I feel like
[02:01:20.310 --> 02:01:23.530]  the community admires
[02:01:24.250 --> 02:01:25.570]  is a guy named
[02:01:25.610 --> 02:01:26.610]  Joey Berger.
[02:01:26.650 --> 02:01:28.410]  He was he reached out like he was
[02:01:28.530 --> 02:01:29.930]  really excited to have that.
[02:01:29.930 --> 02:01:31.370]  We were having you on the show.
[02:01:31.610 --> 02:01:33.130]  And I feel like it's almost just
[02:01:33.130 --> 02:01:34.770]  like, you know, a Joey
[02:01:35.290 --> 02:01:36.850]  Berger. And then he's educating and
[02:01:36.850 --> 02:01:37.770]  then more and more people are
[02:01:37.770 --> 02:01:38.610]  starting to pop up.
[02:01:38.610 --> 02:01:39.690]  And now they have their little
[02:01:39.690 --> 02:01:40.970]  tentacles, the things that they're
[02:01:40.970 --> 02:01:42.570]  doing. And now it seems like now
[02:01:42.570 --> 02:01:44.290]  here comes that third generation,
[02:01:44.290 --> 02:01:46.290]  if you will, of
[02:01:46.490 --> 02:01:47.890]  understanding this kind of stuff.
[02:01:47.890 --> 02:01:49.530]  And it's only it hasn't obviously
[02:01:49.530 --> 02:01:51.050]  taking three generations
[02:01:51.570 --> 02:01:52.770]  to continue to do that.
[02:01:52.770 --> 02:01:54.050]  And I think that's what's so
[02:01:54.050 --> 02:01:55.370]  exciting about this is that it's
[02:01:55.370 --> 02:01:57.370]  only three generations to
[02:01:57.370 --> 02:01:58.970]  continue to promote this
[02:01:59.290 --> 02:02:00.370]  kind of educational stuff.
[02:02:00.410 --> 02:02:01.570]  It seems like it only maybe takes a
[02:02:01.570 --> 02:02:03.090]  couple of years, three years to five
[02:02:03.090 --> 02:02:04.850]  years, and then a whole new group
[02:02:04.850 --> 02:02:06.730]  of people are really digesting this
[02:02:06.730 --> 02:02:08.490]  and understanding it and taking
[02:02:08.490 --> 02:02:09.730]  it to the commercial level.
[02:02:10.290 --> 02:02:11.850]  So I've you know, that's one of the
[02:02:11.850 --> 02:02:13.130]  reasons I reached out to you, man,
[02:02:13.130 --> 02:02:14.570]  is because I feel like there's just
[02:02:14.570 --> 02:02:16.530]  a wave of people that understand
[02:02:16.530 --> 02:02:18.290]  this. And then how do you argue
[02:02:18.290 --> 02:02:19.290]  with the results?
[02:02:19.330 --> 02:02:20.490]  I mean, there's really nothing.
[02:02:22.170 --> 02:02:23.170]  It's hard.
[02:02:23.170 --> 02:02:24.170]  It's hard to say.
[02:02:24.170 --> 02:02:25.530]  But I think it's a good thing that
[02:02:25.530 --> 02:02:26.970]  you're running and everything is as
[02:02:26.970 --> 02:02:28.450]  beautiful as it can be for your
[02:02:28.450 --> 02:02:29.650]  certain scenario and your
[02:02:29.650 --> 02:02:30.650]  environment.
[02:02:30.970 --> 02:02:31.970]  You know, it
[02:02:32.810 --> 02:02:34.170]  that's how Mother Nature can take
[02:02:34.170 --> 02:02:36.050]  place when a farmer is working with
[02:02:36.050 --> 02:02:37.050]  Mother Nature.
[02:02:37.410 --> 02:02:39.010]  Yeah. And the proof really is in the
[02:02:39.010 --> 02:02:40.330]  pudding. It is an honor.
[02:02:40.330 --> 02:02:41.970]  Like Joey is one of my one
[02:02:41.970 --> 02:02:42.970]  of my mentors.
[02:02:42.970 --> 02:02:44.810]  I've actually never had the pleasure
[02:02:44.810 --> 02:02:46.050]  of hanging out with him.
[02:02:46.210 --> 02:02:47.970]  You know, farming is busy,
[02:02:48.210 --> 02:02:49.490]  busy work and being out on the
[02:02:49.490 --> 02:02:50.490]  hills.
[02:02:51.050 --> 02:02:52.450]  Even though you're 10 miles
[02:02:52.450 --> 02:02:54.090]  from work day and then those 10
[02:02:54.090 --> 02:02:55.490]  miles out in the middle of the
[02:02:55.570 --> 02:02:57.370]  mountains, it's a long,
[02:02:57.690 --> 02:02:59.490]  long trip. But I've been watching
[02:02:59.490 --> 02:03:01.570]  Joey and his work for
[02:03:01.570 --> 02:03:02.570]  three years now.
[02:03:02.810 --> 02:03:04.530]  And he's definitely like, you
[02:03:04.530 --> 02:03:06.490]  know, someone who I think
[02:03:06.490 --> 02:03:08.370]  is a great, great member
[02:03:08.370 --> 02:03:10.290]  of the community and does a lot.
[02:03:10.450 --> 02:03:11.610]  And he goes out of his way to
[02:03:11.610 --> 02:03:13.530]  educate people, which I
[02:03:13.530 --> 02:03:15.370]  you know, I really appreciate.
[02:03:15.370 --> 02:03:16.730]  And he cares, you know,
[02:03:18.610 --> 02:03:20.450]  for instance, just even the simple
[02:03:20.730 --> 02:03:22.610]  like, you know, he's showing
[02:03:22.610 --> 02:03:24.050]  people how to make Jadam wedding
[02:03:24.050 --> 02:03:25.650]  agent. And that stuff is,
[02:03:26.370 --> 02:03:27.770]  you know, pesticides are one of the
[02:03:27.770 --> 02:03:29.570]  more costly things that
[02:03:29.570 --> 02:03:31.770]  are that are around
[02:03:31.770 --> 02:03:34.210]  in the agricultural
[02:03:34.210 --> 02:03:35.210]  business.
[02:03:35.450 --> 02:03:37.450]  And, you know, you spend
[02:03:37.770 --> 02:03:39.370]  hundreds and hundreds or thousands
[02:03:39.370 --> 02:03:41.290]  and thousands of dollars when you
[02:03:41.290 --> 02:03:43.170]  can literally cook up a batch
[02:03:43.170 --> 02:03:44.650]  of insecticidal soap
[02:03:45.090 --> 02:03:46.890]  that also functions as like
[02:03:47.250 --> 02:03:48.170]  you know, you can use it.
[02:03:48.170 --> 02:03:49.090]  It's like a steel soap.
[02:03:49.090 --> 02:03:50.330]  It's basically Dr.
[02:03:50.330 --> 02:03:51.330]  Bronner's.
[02:03:51.330 --> 02:03:53.090]  But you're paying, you
[02:03:53.090 --> 02:03:54.650]  know, a dollar a gallon for this
[02:03:54.650 --> 02:03:56.530]  stuff. Go try to find a pesticide
[02:03:56.530 --> 02:03:58.130]  for see what you can buy with a
[02:03:58.130 --> 02:03:59.130]  dollar.
[02:03:59.530 --> 02:04:01.450]  So I really like he cares.
[02:04:01.450 --> 02:04:02.770]  He cares about the farmer and
[02:04:02.770 --> 02:04:04.490]  educating them and like helping,
[02:04:04.490 --> 02:04:06.330]  trying to save them, save
[02:04:06.330 --> 02:04:08.130]  them money because
[02:04:08.450 --> 02:04:09.890]  we really need that now.
[02:04:11.410 --> 02:04:12.170]  Yes. Yeah.
[02:04:12.170 --> 02:04:14.010]  Like it's really like kind of make
[02:04:14.010 --> 02:04:15.570]  or break these next few years.
[02:04:15.570 --> 02:04:16.570]  And if you're spending
[02:04:17.570 --> 02:04:19.210]  you know, your nutrients are
[02:04:19.210 --> 02:04:20.370]  costing you thousands and
[02:04:20.370 --> 02:04:21.170]  thousands of dollars, your
[02:04:21.170 --> 02:04:22.490]  pesticides are thousands of
[02:04:22.490 --> 02:04:23.490]  thousands of dollars.
[02:04:24.530 --> 02:04:26.050]  What's what's left for you if,
[02:04:26.050 --> 02:04:27.650]  you know, pounds of cannabis are
[02:04:27.650 --> 02:04:29.450]  selling for 300 bucks and it
[02:04:29.450 --> 02:04:31.370]  costs 250 bucks to produce
[02:04:31.370 --> 02:04:32.370]  a pound.
[02:04:33.970 --> 02:04:35.170]  So, yeah, Joey's the man.
[02:04:35.170 --> 02:04:37.090]  And it just like I said
[02:04:37.090 --> 02:04:38.610]  before, when I first got on here,
[02:04:38.650 --> 02:04:39.810]  I'm standing on the shoulder of
[02:04:39.810 --> 02:04:42.130]  giants. There's a lot of amazing
[02:04:42.130 --> 02:04:43.330]  people in this community
[02:04:44.490 --> 02:04:45.930]  sharing and
[02:04:46.450 --> 02:04:48.130]  making information readily
[02:04:48.130 --> 02:04:49.210]  available for everybody.
[02:04:51.610 --> 02:04:53.370]  Yeah, man, it's it's pretty
[02:04:53.370 --> 02:04:55.290]  cool to see how quick people
[02:04:55.290 --> 02:04:56.530]  can take that. And we've mentioned
[02:04:56.530 --> 02:04:58.210]  on the show several times just how
[02:04:58.650 --> 02:05:00.370]  the overall improvement of going
[02:05:00.370 --> 02:05:02.290]  from like blasting B.H.
[02:05:02.290 --> 02:05:04.170]  O in everybody's backyard through
[02:05:04.170 --> 02:05:06.090]  tubes to now just seeing the actual
[02:05:06.090 --> 02:05:08.290]  artwork of of where concentrates
[02:05:08.290 --> 02:05:09.290]  have gone.
[02:05:09.570 --> 02:05:10.970]  And I feel like in a time frame
[02:05:10.970 --> 02:05:12.450]  that's extremely short.
[02:05:13.090 --> 02:05:14.610]  And I feel like it's because there
[02:05:14.690 --> 02:05:15.690]  is more like open
[02:05:16.730 --> 02:05:18.410]  source technology or, you know,
[02:05:18.410 --> 02:05:19.610]  there's tech out there that people
[02:05:19.610 --> 02:05:20.610]  are willing to share.
[02:05:21.050 --> 02:05:22.970]  And then somebody, it seems
[02:05:22.970 --> 02:05:24.890]  like smarter or maybe has a
[02:05:24.890 --> 02:05:26.170]  different viewpoint or something
[02:05:26.170 --> 02:05:27.130]  like that, then takes it to the
[02:05:27.130 --> 02:05:28.290]  next level or thinks about a
[02:05:28.290 --> 02:05:29.970]  different way so that the the
[02:05:29.970 --> 02:05:31.450]  genetics are really starting to
[02:05:31.450 --> 02:05:33.410]  shine through when the when
[02:05:33.410 --> 02:05:34.410]  the work is being done.
[02:05:36.570 --> 02:05:38.450]  Most definitely, yeah, I remember
[02:05:38.530 --> 02:05:40.450]  my first exposure to
[02:05:40.690 --> 02:05:42.530]  hash oil and people
[02:05:42.530 --> 02:05:44.330]  were taking a turkey baster,
[02:05:44.330 --> 02:05:46.210]  a coffee filter and some some
[02:05:46.210 --> 02:05:48.210]  shake and fricking
[02:05:48.610 --> 02:05:50.290]  open blasting through this and
[02:05:50.290 --> 02:05:51.370]  collecting their Pyrex.
[02:05:51.370 --> 02:05:52.650]  And it was just this really
[02:05:52.650 --> 02:05:53.810]  backwoods
[02:05:55.410 --> 02:05:57.770]  sketchy, dangerous process.
[02:05:57.770 --> 02:05:59.610]  And, you know, it has it's
[02:05:59.610 --> 02:06:01.570]  come a long, long, long
[02:06:01.570 --> 02:06:02.570]  way. I mean,
[02:06:04.010 --> 02:06:05.890]  since since the
[02:06:05.890 --> 02:06:07.570]  kind of B.H.O. really started
[02:06:07.570 --> 02:06:09.450]  hitting the shelves and now
[02:06:09.450 --> 02:06:11.090]  it's it's people are starting to
[02:06:11.090 --> 02:06:12.690]  wise up and they want solventless
[02:06:12.690 --> 02:06:14.570]  hash. And that's like the
[02:06:15.170 --> 02:06:16.490]  the talk of the town, which I
[02:06:16.490 --> 02:06:17.490]  really,
[02:06:18.290 --> 02:06:19.290]  you know, it's just
[02:06:20.170 --> 02:06:21.850]  it's just for me, it just feels
[02:06:21.850 --> 02:06:22.970]  better at the end of the day,
[02:06:22.970 --> 02:06:24.650]  having this kind of natural
[02:06:24.650 --> 02:06:26.570]  process where you're not adding
[02:06:27.770 --> 02:06:29.090]  any kind of chemicals.
[02:06:29.090 --> 02:06:30.450]  There's no laboratory that's
[02:06:30.450 --> 02:06:31.450]  necessary.
[02:06:32.690 --> 02:06:34.490]  And I think it delivers a higher
[02:06:34.490 --> 02:06:36.090]  for higher quality products
[02:06:36.410 --> 02:06:38.050]  and people are becoming educated.
[02:06:38.050 --> 02:06:39.530]  You know, B.H.O.
[02:06:39.530 --> 02:06:41.730]  it's not nearly as popular
[02:06:41.730 --> 02:06:43.010]  as it used to be.
[02:06:43.010 --> 02:06:44.610]  People still partake,
[02:06:44.610 --> 02:06:46.570]  but it's come a long way
[02:06:46.570 --> 02:06:48.210]  in the last five years.
[02:06:49.450 --> 02:06:50.730]  Yeah, it was really interesting to
[02:06:50.730 --> 02:06:52.130]  see if you guys have ever checked
[02:06:52.130 --> 02:06:53.650]  out MJ BizCon
[02:06:53.650 --> 02:06:55.050]  on when they were selling all of
[02:06:55.050 --> 02:06:56.610]  that material, especially to
[02:06:56.610 --> 02:06:58.130]  basically the suit, selling it to
[02:06:58.130 --> 02:06:59.890]  the bigger suits, the really deep
[02:06:59.890 --> 02:07:01.370]  pocketed individuals where they
[02:07:01.370 --> 02:07:03.090]  are putting up, you know, some
[02:07:03.090 --> 02:07:04.810]  of those machines are extremely
[02:07:04.810 --> 02:07:05.770]  costly.
[02:07:05.770 --> 02:07:07.530]  And then I felt like especially at
[02:07:07.530 --> 02:07:09.290]  that time, there was more of like
[02:07:09.290 --> 02:07:11.090]  the hippie giggly crowd
[02:07:11.130 --> 02:07:12.330]  was doing that shit with their
[02:07:12.330 --> 02:07:14.250]  girlfriend's hair straightener and
[02:07:14.250 --> 02:07:15.650]  trying to just start figuring out
[02:07:15.650 --> 02:07:17.850]  ways that is obviously drastically
[02:07:17.850 --> 02:07:18.930]  cheaper.
[02:07:18.930 --> 02:07:20.450]  So continue down in that road.
[02:07:20.450 --> 02:07:21.730]  I feel like that's where that kind
[02:07:21.730 --> 02:07:23.730]  of veered off is whoever
[02:07:23.730 --> 02:07:25.850]  came up with grabbing
[02:07:25.850 --> 02:07:27.330]  their girlfriend's hair straightener
[02:07:27.330 --> 02:07:28.530]  and kind of running that way with
[02:07:28.530 --> 02:07:29.530]  it, with things.
[02:07:30.130 --> 02:07:31.490]  And from what I understand, there
[02:07:31.490 --> 02:07:33.250]  were like really old heads
[02:07:33.250 --> 02:07:34.290]  that knew how to do that in like
[02:07:34.290 --> 02:07:35.330]  the 70s and stuff.
[02:07:35.330 --> 02:07:36.490]  So I don't think it's like brand
[02:07:36.490 --> 02:07:37.090]  new or anything.
[02:07:37.090 --> 02:07:38.970]  I just feel like that's when the
[02:07:38.970 --> 02:07:40.330]  masses found out about it.
[02:07:41.690 --> 02:07:43.290]  Yeah, I doubt that it's just
[02:07:43.290 --> 02:07:44.370]  popped up.
[02:07:44.370 --> 02:07:46.010]  It's just it became exposed and
[02:07:46.010 --> 02:07:47.250]  kind of brought to the general
[02:07:47.250 --> 02:07:49.010]  population where, yeah,
[02:07:49.010 --> 02:07:50.330]  of course, there's definitely some
[02:07:50.330 --> 02:07:51.970]  old head out there somewhere who
[02:07:51.970 --> 02:07:53.930]  was who was, you know, doing
[02:07:53.930 --> 02:07:55.770]  do an ice water hash and then
[02:07:55.770 --> 02:07:57.450]  and then probably squishing that,
[02:07:57.450 --> 02:07:59.050]  you know, one way or another with
[02:07:59.050 --> 02:08:00.050]  some hot plates.
[02:08:01.530 --> 02:08:03.410]  For sure, I just usually
[02:08:03.410 --> 02:08:05.050]  things don't just pop out of out of
[02:08:05.050 --> 02:08:06.410]  thin air like that.
[02:08:06.410 --> 02:08:07.890]  There's some kind of tradition,
[02:08:07.890 --> 02:08:08.890]  some kind of
[02:08:09.890 --> 02:08:11.330]  something being passed down from
[02:08:11.330 --> 02:08:12.330]  someone else.
[02:08:13.650 --> 02:08:14.650]  Can you guys hear me?
[02:08:16.450 --> 02:08:17.810]  Yeah, I can hear you.
[02:08:18.690 --> 02:08:19.930]  Am I glitching still?
[02:08:21.410 --> 02:08:22.490]  No, you're good.
[02:08:22.490 --> 02:08:23.490]  Welcome back.
[02:08:24.050 --> 02:08:25.650]  Because it's this Internet's been
[02:08:25.650 --> 02:08:26.650]  really fucked up.
[02:08:27.010 --> 02:08:28.850]  Anyway, I remember as a kid back
[02:08:28.850 --> 02:08:30.410]  in the 80s, we used to get this
[02:08:30.410 --> 02:08:32.210]  green hash and it was made
[02:08:32.210 --> 02:08:33.410]  through dry sifting.
[02:08:34.010 --> 02:08:35.290]  And the guy would heat up this
[02:08:35.290 --> 02:08:37.130]  like metal puck and
[02:08:37.130 --> 02:08:38.490]  he'd pour the dry sift in it.
[02:08:38.690 --> 02:08:40.210]  And then press it with a with a
[02:08:40.210 --> 02:08:41.810]  car jack with a, you know, like a
[02:08:41.810 --> 02:08:42.810]  10 ton jack.
[02:08:43.210 --> 02:08:44.730]  And he'd make these cakes with the
[02:08:44.730 --> 02:08:46.410]  stuff. And we loved it.
[02:08:46.410 --> 02:08:47.290]  It smoked great.
[02:08:47.290 --> 02:08:48.970]  But it was nothing like the
[02:08:48.970 --> 02:08:50.370]  concentrates nowadays.
[02:08:51.010 --> 02:08:52.170]  But it worked.
[02:08:53.450 --> 02:08:54.450]  Real hippie shit.
[02:08:55.930 --> 02:08:57.250]  There you go. There are some like
[02:08:57.250 --> 02:08:58.250]  really like
[02:08:59.690 --> 02:09:01.530]  early kind of form of
[02:09:01.530 --> 02:09:03.690]  hash rosen being our rosen
[02:09:03.690 --> 02:09:05.130]  being being produced
[02:09:05.930 --> 02:09:08.010]  way before, way, way before
[02:09:09.010 --> 02:09:10.130]  you know, I don't remember hash
[02:09:10.130 --> 02:09:10.890]  rosen.
[02:09:10.890 --> 02:09:12.410]  What it's like seemingly hit the
[02:09:12.410 --> 02:09:13.650]  dispensary shelves
[02:09:14.250 --> 02:09:16.210]  like not too long ago.
[02:09:16.210 --> 02:09:17.370]  But yeah, of course, people were
[02:09:17.370 --> 02:09:18.250]  finding ways.
[02:09:18.250 --> 02:09:19.890]  And that's that's ingenious.
[02:09:19.930 --> 02:09:21.210]  You know, pressure and heat
[02:09:22.570 --> 02:09:23.690]  in a filter.
[02:09:24.410 --> 02:09:25.570]  I wonder why it was green.
[02:09:25.570 --> 02:09:26.770]  If it was, you know, if he had a
[02:09:26.770 --> 02:09:28.490]  filter for it or was he just
[02:09:28.490 --> 02:09:29.810]  pressing the plant material?
[02:09:29.970 --> 02:09:31.410]  It was just the plant material.
[02:09:31.410 --> 02:09:32.810]  It would just he would vibrate.
[02:09:32.810 --> 02:09:34.450]  They'd try to vibrate the trikes
[02:09:34.450 --> 02:09:36.290]  off. So it was a ton of, you know,
[02:09:36.290 --> 02:09:37.050]  chlorophyll.
[02:09:37.090 --> 02:09:39.090]  And, you know, it wasn't super
[02:09:39.090 --> 02:09:40.890]  clean, but it did the job,
[02:09:40.890 --> 02:09:42.410]  man. It was it was way better than
[02:09:42.410 --> 02:09:44.170]  the black hash that made you sleep.
[02:09:44.690 --> 02:09:46.370]  Like we also would get the black
[02:09:46.370 --> 02:09:47.770]  hash or hash oil,
[02:09:48.690 --> 02:09:50.210]  which, you know, that one you just
[02:09:50.210 --> 02:09:51.770]  kind of smoked and laid down the
[02:09:51.770 --> 02:09:52.770]  couch.
[02:09:53.610 --> 02:09:54.610]  You know, yeah.
[02:09:55.530 --> 02:09:57.250]  But the green stuff was was fun.
[02:09:57.250 --> 02:09:58.210]  And then there was of course there
[02:09:58.210 --> 02:09:59.410]  was the blonde stuff,
[02:10:00.890 --> 02:10:02.090]  the red stuff.
[02:10:02.170 --> 02:10:04.170]  And these were all, I'm sure, made
[02:10:04.170 --> 02:10:06.210]  similar to this, you know, based
[02:10:06.290 --> 02:10:07.970]  on the plant material was showing,
[02:10:08.050 --> 02:10:09.410]  you know, was showing its true
[02:10:09.410 --> 02:10:11.450]  colors. The blonde, the blonde was
[02:10:11.450 --> 02:10:12.690]  probably a cleaner
[02:10:13.570 --> 02:10:15.170]  dry sift than the rest of them
[02:10:15.170 --> 02:10:16.850]  because it had that that color like
[02:10:16.850 --> 02:10:18.610]  you see in people like nowadays,
[02:10:19.130 --> 02:10:20.370]  especially in the, you know, the
[02:10:21.410 --> 02:10:22.450]  squishing techniques.
[02:10:22.890 --> 02:10:24.610]  But yeah, it was so
[02:10:24.610 --> 02:10:26.290]  somebody was doing it way back when.
[02:10:26.290 --> 02:10:28.130]  And I wish Frenchie was still around
[02:10:28.130 --> 02:10:29.290]  because he could go
[02:10:30.290 --> 02:10:31.290]  out this.
[02:10:32.290 --> 02:10:33.290]  You know, I miss that.
[02:10:33.290 --> 02:10:34.290]  He's a great person.
[02:10:35.130 --> 02:10:36.930]  He's a great person to listen to.
[02:10:37.850 --> 02:10:39.730]  The Gangier program actually has
[02:10:39.730 --> 02:10:40.930]  an amazing,
[02:10:41.930 --> 02:10:44.170]  you know, section with Frenchie
[02:10:44.370 --> 02:10:45.570]  where he goes over kind of the
[02:10:45.570 --> 02:10:47.330]  origins and anthropology
[02:10:47.330 --> 02:10:48.890]  of humans and cannabis
[02:10:49.370 --> 02:10:51.210]  and, you know, the
[02:10:51.210 --> 02:10:52.970]  ancient extraction methods.
[02:10:53.010 --> 02:10:54.930]  And it's it's that right there
[02:10:54.930 --> 02:10:56.410]  is worth the course alone,
[02:10:56.970 --> 02:10:57.970]  worth paying for it.
[02:10:58.370 --> 02:11:00.530]  And, yeah, it's it really is a shame
[02:11:00.530 --> 02:11:02.450]  because he is he was an
[02:11:02.490 --> 02:11:03.970]  awesome fucking dude.
[02:11:03.970 --> 02:11:05.570]  I would have loved to have sat down
[02:11:05.570 --> 02:11:07.210]  and bullshitted with him, smoke some
[02:11:07.210 --> 02:11:08.210]  hash
[02:11:09.730 --> 02:11:10.370]  for sure.
[02:11:10.370 --> 02:11:12.650]  And, you know, Leighton, I
[02:11:12.650 --> 02:11:14.770]  still with all the the hash rosin
[02:11:14.770 --> 02:11:16.930]  and stuff like that, my favorite
[02:11:16.930 --> 02:11:18.610]  type of hash to smoke is you guys
[02:11:18.610 --> 02:11:19.530]  probably are going to see this too
[02:11:19.530 --> 02:11:21.450]  well, is I have a nice little dry
[02:11:21.450 --> 02:11:22.970]  sift chunk here.
[02:11:23.250 --> 02:11:25.930]  I have some frickin some charas
[02:11:26.210 --> 02:11:27.210]  right there.
[02:11:27.450 --> 02:11:29.410]  I have like this whole little thing
[02:11:29.410 --> 02:11:31.370]  is just filled with with different
[02:11:31.370 --> 02:11:33.290]  types of just solventless, like
[02:11:33.290 --> 02:11:34.370]  kind of ancient.
[02:11:34.530 --> 02:11:36.050]  No, there's some water hash in here,
[02:11:36.450 --> 02:11:38.130]  but just, you know, old school
[02:11:38.130 --> 02:11:40.010]  techniques. And I fucking love smoking
[02:11:40.010 --> 02:11:40.850]  this stuff, man.
[02:11:40.850 --> 02:11:42.210]  I love having it around.
[02:11:42.210 --> 02:11:43.850]  And it's like such a treat to me to
[02:11:43.850 --> 02:11:45.770]  have, you know, all the all
[02:11:45.770 --> 02:11:47.010]  the different varieties
[02:11:48.850 --> 02:11:50.330]  where, yeah, I mean, it's just it
[02:11:50.330 --> 02:11:52.570]  really is. There's the hash process.
[02:11:52.570 --> 02:11:54.330]  That's a whole different art form.
[02:11:54.330 --> 02:11:56.090]  You know, cultivation is one thing,
[02:11:56.730 --> 02:11:58.890]  but the extraction process
[02:11:58.890 --> 02:12:00.650]  is a whole I mean, it's obviously
[02:12:00.650 --> 02:12:01.650]  related, but.
[02:12:02.650 --> 02:12:03.970]  It's a it's a different art,
[02:12:04.730 --> 02:12:06.410]  and it's just it's an amazing
[02:12:06.530 --> 02:12:08.130]  art form that I still have yet to
[02:12:08.130 --> 02:12:10.010]  even dive in more than
[02:12:10.010 --> 02:12:11.330]  just having a rudimentary
[02:12:11.330 --> 02:12:13.530]  understanding, but something
[02:12:13.530 --> 02:12:15.170]  that I'm looking forward to, you
[02:12:15.170 --> 02:12:17.210]  know, taking the time and
[02:12:17.210 --> 02:12:18.890]  learning how to how to produce my
[02:12:18.890 --> 02:12:20.810]  own solventless hash and and kind
[02:12:20.810 --> 02:12:22.810]  of understudying my my friend who
[02:12:23.250 --> 02:12:25.210]  who produces solventless.
[02:12:29.600 --> 02:12:31.680]  Yeah, it was really just sent me a
[02:12:31.680 --> 02:12:32.680]  temple ball.
[02:12:33.680 --> 02:12:35.280]  And I love to take a little bit of
[02:12:35.280 --> 02:12:36.480]  it, put it in the grinder with the
[02:12:36.480 --> 02:12:37.240]  flour.
[02:12:37.240 --> 02:12:39.240]  It just brings some wonderful flavor
[02:12:39.240 --> 02:12:40.360]  bouquet into it.
[02:12:40.920 --> 02:12:41.840]  So I'm with you, dude.
[02:12:41.840 --> 02:12:42.840]  I love your collection.
[02:12:43.600 --> 02:12:45.720]  It's different, like smoking, like,
[02:12:45.720 --> 02:12:47.640]  you know, obviously, rosin is
[02:12:47.640 --> 02:12:49.720]  great, you know, smoke.
[02:12:49.720 --> 02:12:51.920]  But like that, the flavor, it's
[02:12:51.920 --> 02:12:54.160]  just like you get that like real
[02:12:54.160 --> 02:12:55.160]  hash
[02:12:56.680 --> 02:12:58.560]  flick like it's just so unique.
[02:12:58.760 --> 02:12:59.800]  And it's something that you don't
[02:12:59.800 --> 02:13:01.880]  really get that in modern forms
[02:13:02.560 --> 02:13:03.560]  of hash making.
[02:13:04.320 --> 02:13:06.040]  It's something is lost in that
[02:13:06.040 --> 02:13:07.040]  process.
[02:13:08.520 --> 02:13:10.440]  Yeah, I got late in one of these
[02:13:10.440 --> 02:13:11.680]  days, we'll we'll get down.
[02:13:11.680 --> 02:13:13.200]  I'll have my little collection of
[02:13:13.600 --> 02:13:15.680]  solventless finger hash
[02:13:15.680 --> 02:13:16.800]  and all of that smoke.
[02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:18.280]  Sometimes people give me shit.
[02:13:18.280 --> 02:13:19.360]  They're like, you're smoking finger
[02:13:19.360 --> 02:13:21.920]  hash. I'm like, yeah,
[02:13:22.520 --> 02:13:23.320]  it's amazing.
[02:13:23.320 --> 02:13:24.320]  Why not?
[02:13:24.920 --> 02:13:26.640]  That was according to Frenchy, that
[02:13:26.640 --> 02:13:27.880]  was the earliest form.
[02:13:27.880 --> 02:13:29.320]  These these monks would run through
[02:13:29.320 --> 02:13:30.840]  their fields with their arms wide
[02:13:30.840 --> 02:13:33.160]  open, knocking trike heads
[02:13:33.160 --> 02:13:34.680]  and then they'd go home and peel,
[02:13:34.680 --> 02:13:36.120]  peel it up and roll it off of
[02:13:37.320 --> 02:13:38.320]  right.
[02:13:38.400 --> 02:13:40.000]  We have this old clothes.
[02:13:42.360 --> 02:13:44.400]  Can you get to the plant anyway?
[02:13:44.400 --> 02:13:45.400]  Go ahead, Brian.
[02:13:45.720 --> 02:13:47.080]  I was just going to say we had this
[02:13:47.080 --> 02:13:48.960]  like hippie couple that
[02:13:48.960 --> 02:13:50.880]  was trimming for us for a while.
[02:13:51.080 --> 02:13:52.720]  And, you know, they
[02:13:53.160 --> 02:13:54.720]  unfortunately, the bosses weren't
[02:13:54.720 --> 02:13:56.040]  really like paying the trimmers,
[02:13:56.040 --> 02:13:57.040]  really anything.
[02:13:57.360 --> 02:13:58.880]  But once the hippie couple found
[02:13:58.880 --> 02:14:00.000]  out that they could take home all
[02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:01.480]  the finger hash that they had made
[02:14:01.480 --> 02:14:03.440]  for that day, it was like, you know,
[02:14:03.440 --> 02:14:05.240]  you would open up Pandora's box,
[02:14:05.240 --> 02:14:06.480]  man. They were there early.
[02:14:06.480 --> 02:14:08.320]  And like I just feel
[02:14:08.320 --> 02:14:10.000]  like some people really enjoy that.
[02:14:10.640 --> 02:14:12.320]  I personally feel like it is a
[02:14:12.320 --> 02:14:13.160]  little bit harsher.
[02:14:13.160 --> 02:14:14.320]  It definitely feels like there's
[02:14:14.320 --> 02:14:16.560]  just more of that rough chlorophyll
[02:14:16.560 --> 02:14:18.120]  when you first get kind of
[02:14:18.480 --> 02:14:19.480]  get into it.
[02:14:21.080 --> 02:14:22.440]  You got to let cure a little bit,
[02:14:22.440 --> 02:14:24.360]  too, because that stuff will it'll
[02:14:24.360 --> 02:14:25.760]  be harsh at first.
[02:14:25.800 --> 02:14:27.280]  But if you let it sit for a couple
[02:14:27.280 --> 02:14:29.320]  months, it really ages
[02:14:29.560 --> 02:14:31.320]  very nicely and kind of smooths out.
[02:14:31.320 --> 02:14:32.880]  But yeah, there is there's definitely
[02:14:32.880 --> 02:14:34.560]  going to be some more plant material
[02:14:35.720 --> 02:14:37.360]  embedded in it just by its very
[02:14:37.360 --> 02:14:39.200]  nature. But yeah, it will cure up
[02:14:39.200 --> 02:14:40.200]  very nicely.
[02:14:41.240 --> 02:14:42.560]  I would almost guarantee these
[02:14:42.560 --> 02:14:44.040]  people are smoking it on the way
[02:14:44.040 --> 02:14:45.040]  home.
[02:14:46.080 --> 02:14:47.400]  I used to do that
[02:14:48.120 --> 02:14:49.120]  for sure.
[02:14:50.360 --> 02:14:51.920]  It's pretty, pretty interesting.
[02:14:53.200 --> 02:14:54.600]  No, but that was a really good gold
[02:14:54.600 --> 02:14:56.360]  nugget, letting it cure, you know,
[02:14:56.360 --> 02:14:57.880]  letting that finger hash cure for a
[02:14:57.960 --> 02:14:59.520]  month. It's going to get a lot
[02:14:59.520 --> 02:15:00.840]  smoother because it's fermented.
[02:15:03.520 --> 02:15:04.840]  So just rolling it up in the little
[02:15:04.840 --> 02:15:06.800]  ball, you know, kind
[02:15:06.800 --> 02:15:08.240]  of taking it off the gloves, rolling
[02:15:08.240 --> 02:15:10.120]  it up over the day, getting
[02:15:10.120 --> 02:15:11.480]  that ball and then just letting that
[02:15:11.480 --> 02:15:13.560]  cure for for a few months, you said.
[02:15:14.080 --> 02:15:15.960]  That's really where you can kind of
[02:15:15.960 --> 02:15:17.720]  make that happen for yourself
[02:15:17.720 --> 02:15:18.720]  where it's not as hard.
[02:15:19.440 --> 02:15:20.920]  Just try to keep it keep it out of
[02:15:20.920 --> 02:15:22.280]  the sun and try to keep it
[02:15:22.280 --> 02:15:24.400]  relatively, you know, not
[02:15:24.400 --> 02:15:26.560]  like sweltering hot and it
[02:15:26.560 --> 02:15:28.200]  cures up and get some smoothness to
[02:15:28.200 --> 02:15:29.200]  it for sure.
[02:15:31.120 --> 02:15:32.120]  Do you mind?
[02:15:32.360 --> 02:15:33.480]  Do you have a little more of the
[02:15:33.480 --> 02:15:34.480]  show and tell?
[02:15:34.520 --> 02:15:36.080]  You have like a few more things to
[02:15:36.080 --> 02:15:36.880]  kind of show off.
[02:15:36.880 --> 02:15:37.880]  Yeah. Yeah.
[02:15:39.200 --> 02:15:39.960]  We're in one sec.
[02:15:39.960 --> 02:15:41.080]  Actually, let me let me go.
[02:15:41.440 --> 02:15:42.360]  I got I'm going to go to the
[02:15:42.360 --> 02:15:43.600]  bathroom real quick and I'm going to
[02:15:43.600 --> 02:15:45.560]  grab my slab of the
[02:15:45.760 --> 02:15:47.760]  the Jolly Rancher rosin and
[02:15:47.760 --> 02:15:49.000]  I got some some buds here.
[02:15:49.040 --> 02:15:51.080]  I don't know how well the resolution
[02:15:51.080 --> 02:15:52.480]  is going to be able to show, but
[02:15:53.120 --> 02:15:54.520]  I definitely love to
[02:15:54.920 --> 02:15:56.080]  love to show you guys some stuff.
[02:15:56.280 --> 02:15:57.600]  Give me a couple of minutes.
[02:15:57.640 --> 02:15:58.640]  I'll be right back.
[02:15:58.640 --> 02:15:59.640]  No problem.
[02:16:00.040 --> 02:16:01.600]  Blatant can rant for what?
[02:16:02.040 --> 02:16:03.560]  Good solid 15 minutes.
[02:16:06.080 --> 02:16:07.960]  What do we want ranting on today,
[02:16:07.960 --> 02:16:08.960]  Peter?
[02:16:10.360 --> 02:16:11.320]  What do you want?
[02:16:11.320 --> 02:16:13.080]  We need to have like a wheel
[02:16:13.080 --> 02:16:15.000]  that we can spin and
[02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:17.000]  then it like stops on a topic
[02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:18.000]  and you just go.
[02:16:18.280 --> 02:16:19.280]  Yeah.
[02:16:20.480 --> 02:16:21.840]  Let me just see because let's see if
[02:16:21.840 --> 02:16:23.320]  any of the questions from the chat
[02:16:23.320 --> 02:16:24.320]  applied to you.
[02:16:28.680 --> 02:16:30.480]  So two of the questions I had
[02:16:30.560 --> 02:16:32.800]  copied down, does he test the soil?
[02:16:33.120 --> 02:16:34.800]  That's a good one to talk to with him
[02:16:34.800 --> 02:16:36.080]  about. And then can we get some
[02:16:36.080 --> 02:16:37.920]  discussion about soil life and dry
[02:16:37.920 --> 02:16:39.600]  farming, specifically when the top
[02:16:39.600 --> 02:16:41.360]  layer of soil is dry?
[02:16:42.360 --> 02:16:44.400]  All right. So he said he's
[02:16:44.400 --> 02:16:46.160]  planning on testing this year,
[02:16:46.560 --> 02:16:48.880]  which I think is a great idea
[02:16:48.920 --> 02:16:50.640]  because, again, it's it's something
[02:16:50.640 --> 02:16:51.920]  that you it's a hidden thing.
[02:16:51.960 --> 02:16:52.960]  You can't see it.
[02:16:53.360 --> 02:16:54.960]  And why not take advantage of the
[02:16:54.960 --> 02:16:55.960]  technology?
[02:16:56.320 --> 02:16:57.320]  That's it at this point.
[02:16:58.400 --> 02:16:59.880]  So, yeah, he's going to test this
[02:16:59.880 --> 02:17:01.520]  year and then you really have to
[02:17:01.520 --> 02:17:03.960]  start to get into thermal
[02:17:03.960 --> 02:17:06.160]  and hydrodynamics to understand
[02:17:06.560 --> 02:17:08.680]  how moisture
[02:17:08.680 --> 02:17:11.080]  moves in in soil structure.
[02:17:11.560 --> 02:17:13.360]  So as the soil heats
[02:17:13.360 --> 02:17:14.400]  up on the surface,
[02:17:15.160 --> 02:17:17.120]  it causes a vacuum
[02:17:17.880 --> 02:17:20.120]  to pull that cold water
[02:17:20.120 --> 02:17:21.440]  up to the surface
[02:17:22.160 --> 02:17:23.960]  because everything in nature wants
[02:17:23.960 --> 02:17:24.960]  to stay in equilibrium.
[02:17:25.840 --> 02:17:27.000]  Those are like the first
[02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:28.000]  rule.
[02:17:29.440 --> 02:17:31.000]  So bottom line is that's you know,
[02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:32.880]  that's why I put
[02:17:32.880 --> 02:17:34.480]  together the horizontal system way
[02:17:34.480 --> 02:17:35.960]  back when it was because I was like,
[02:17:35.960 --> 02:17:38.000]  you guys are farming in low tension
[02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:39.000]  soils.
[02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:40.640]  So you're getting anaerobic on the
[02:17:40.640 --> 02:17:42.440]  bottom. You're going hydrophobic on
[02:17:42.440 --> 02:17:43.360]  the top.
[02:17:43.360 --> 02:17:45.200]  So why not use nature's
[02:17:45.200 --> 02:17:47.000]  own way of dealing with these
[02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:49.080]  types of forces?
[02:17:49.480 --> 02:17:51.080]  You know, hydrodynamic,
[02:17:51.080 --> 02:17:52.320]  thermodynamic forces.
[02:17:52.760 --> 02:17:53.840]  So he's back now.
[02:17:53.840 --> 02:17:55.840]  So that's my short rant for today.
[02:17:56.800 --> 02:17:57.920]  I will real quick late.
[02:17:57.920 --> 02:17:59.360]  And I do want to give you a shout
[02:17:59.360 --> 02:18:00.880]  out and Marco shout out because
[02:18:00.880 --> 02:18:03.040]  Marco kind of showed a
[02:18:03.040 --> 02:18:05.040]  microcosm version of that in a
[02:18:05.240 --> 02:18:06.640]  vivarium or terrarium
[02:18:07.200 --> 02:18:09.000]  setup. So you use your soil
[02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:10.600]  horizon setup, explained it
[02:18:10.840 --> 02:18:12.560]  on a smaller scale so
[02:18:12.560 --> 02:18:14.360]  that individuals like shout out
[02:18:14.360 --> 02:18:16.320]  to Chad might want to come over
[02:18:16.320 --> 02:18:17.440]  from the more of the bottled
[02:18:17.440 --> 02:18:19.560]  nutrients or at least create
[02:18:19.560 --> 02:18:21.400]  like a vivarium terrarium
[02:18:21.400 --> 02:18:22.600]  this winter and kind of see how
[02:18:22.600 --> 02:18:23.600]  things take hold.
[02:18:23.840 --> 02:18:24.840]  How he added
[02:18:25.680 --> 02:18:27.600]  like beneficial bugs
[02:18:27.600 --> 02:18:28.600]  and that kind of stuff.
[02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:30.040]  So just wanted to give you a quick
[02:18:30.040 --> 02:18:31.080]  shout out, Layton, because you kind
[02:18:31.080 --> 02:18:32.080]  of inspired that.
[02:18:32.720 --> 02:18:34.320]  I'm telling you guys, everybody
[02:18:34.320 --> 02:18:35.640]  that I've helped through the
[02:18:35.960 --> 02:18:37.800]  process hits me back
[02:18:37.800 --> 02:18:39.840]  up is like, I can't believe
[02:18:39.840 --> 02:18:41.440]  I didn't I haven't used this
[02:18:41.440 --> 02:18:42.440]  technique before.
[02:18:42.680 --> 02:18:44.120]  It's so much easier.
[02:18:44.320 --> 02:18:46.240]  One guy said he basically watered
[02:18:46.280 --> 02:18:47.440]  twice in the season.
[02:18:48.320 --> 02:18:50.520]  He used the horizon as a reservoir,
[02:18:50.520 --> 02:18:51.760]  which it works perfect.
[02:18:51.760 --> 02:18:53.120]  Does so.
[02:18:53.120 --> 02:18:54.480]  Yeah, there's I hope more people
[02:18:54.480 --> 02:18:55.800]  play with it because it just makes
[02:18:55.800 --> 02:18:56.920]  things so much easier.
[02:18:57.560 --> 02:18:59.240]  It really does, especially in pots
[02:18:59.240 --> 02:19:00.480]  and indoor raised beds.
[02:19:02.160 --> 02:19:03.160]  All right, show me what
[02:19:03.880 --> 02:19:04.880]  we got.
[02:19:07.170 --> 02:19:09.210]  Permanent set up so I can get the
[02:19:09.570 --> 02:19:11.330]  horizontal soil system set up,
[02:19:11.330 --> 02:19:13.090]  I am like so excited
[02:19:13.090 --> 02:19:14.850]  and like this right now, it's
[02:19:14.970 --> 02:19:16.690]  I'm kind of not in a permanent
[02:19:16.690 --> 02:19:17.450]  location.
[02:19:17.450 --> 02:19:19.250]  So setting that up in such
[02:19:19.250 --> 02:19:20.970]  a large, you know,
[02:19:21.410 --> 02:19:23.250]  four by eight bed, it would just
[02:19:23.290 --> 02:19:24.450]  be like a really,
[02:19:26.090 --> 02:19:27.970]  really cumbersome thing to
[02:19:27.970 --> 02:19:29.810]  have to move around and unload.
[02:19:30.130 --> 02:19:32.410]  But I cannot frickin wait.
[02:19:32.410 --> 02:19:34.490]  I am so excited about setting
[02:19:34.490 --> 02:19:36.410]  that up. I'm just anybody who
[02:19:36.410 --> 02:19:38.090]  asked me, I'm like, who's trying
[02:19:38.090 --> 02:19:39.290]  to get into organic growing?
[02:19:39.290 --> 02:19:40.570]  I tell them straight up.
[02:19:40.570 --> 02:19:42.530]  I'm like, go watch these
[02:19:42.530 --> 02:19:43.530]  YouTube videos.
[02:19:43.810 --> 02:19:45.810]  Go check out what
[02:19:45.810 --> 02:19:46.810]  shaping fire.
[02:19:47.090 --> 02:19:48.930]  Shango has an amazing
[02:19:48.930 --> 02:19:50.650]  tutorial on his Instagram of
[02:19:50.650 --> 02:19:51.570]  everything.
[02:19:51.570 --> 02:19:53.690]  So, yeah, I just highly
[02:19:53.690 --> 02:19:55.490]  recommend people look into that
[02:19:55.490 --> 02:19:57.370]  because it is I'm sure I've
[02:19:57.370 --> 02:19:58.890]  seen it work like other people
[02:19:58.890 --> 02:20:00.530]  using it. It's a game changer.
[02:20:01.050 --> 02:20:02.330]  Definitely a game changer.
[02:20:04.170 --> 02:20:06.570]  So here's here's a nice slab
[02:20:06.570 --> 02:20:08.530]  of the
[02:20:08.530 --> 02:20:09.730]  hash from that.
[02:20:09.770 --> 02:20:10.770]  You just wait.
[02:20:12.290 --> 02:20:13.930]  Jesus Christ, it is.
[02:20:15.570 --> 02:20:16.570]  What are we saying, Layton?
[02:20:18.770 --> 02:20:20.410]  Brian, you're like, Jesus Christ.
[02:20:22.570 --> 02:20:24.570]  I'm still I'm still literally
[02:20:24.570 --> 02:20:25.570]  glitching.
[02:20:25.570 --> 02:20:26.970]  I'm still clearly glitching the
[02:20:26.970 --> 02:20:27.970]  fuck out of here.
[02:20:27.970 --> 02:20:29.370]  But Layton, maybe
[02:20:29.370 --> 02:20:31.490]  maybe all of that information
[02:20:31.490 --> 02:20:32.730]  is go on YouTube.
[02:20:35.410 --> 02:20:37.050]  He's now hearing me late.
[02:20:37.050 --> 02:20:39.290]  Maybe restart your modem.
[02:20:41.130 --> 02:20:42.290]  He'll hear that in about 10
[02:20:42.290 --> 02:20:43.290]  seconds.
[02:20:45.050 --> 02:20:46.530]  I hear you.
[02:20:46.890 --> 02:20:48.370]  I was fucking around with that
[02:20:48.370 --> 02:20:49.650]  trying to get that going.
[02:20:49.770 --> 02:20:50.770]  But it wasn't working.
[02:20:50.770 --> 02:20:52.410]  So anyway, I'll just speak out real
[02:20:52.410 --> 02:20:54.570]  quick. So if anybody's interested,
[02:20:54.570 --> 02:20:56.810]  the easiest way to find it is YouTube
[02:20:56.810 --> 02:20:58.810]  Layton Morrison soil
[02:20:58.810 --> 02:21:00.490]  horizons. There's all kinds of shit
[02:21:00.490 --> 02:21:02.690]  up on there from shorts
[02:21:02.690 --> 02:21:04.490]  to our work, Peter.
[02:21:04.490 --> 02:21:05.610]  And we're going to be doing another
[02:21:05.610 --> 02:21:07.890]  one coming up in another month.
[02:21:08.210 --> 02:21:09.810]  So so that more people can
[02:21:09.810 --> 02:21:11.250]  understand how easy it is.
[02:21:11.770 --> 02:21:13.330]  Collecting is a little hard.
[02:21:13.570 --> 02:21:15.370]  I'm working with a company out here
[02:21:15.370 --> 02:21:17.290]  in in Moorpark to blend
[02:21:17.290 --> 02:21:18.290]  up the AHAs.
[02:21:18.290 --> 02:21:19.970]  And for people, so all you'll have to
[02:21:19.970 --> 02:21:22.010]  do is call them, order a 40
[02:21:22.010 --> 02:21:23.890]  pound bag or how many you need.
[02:21:23.890 --> 02:21:25.890]  And that way it takes all the real
[02:21:25.890 --> 02:21:27.610]  hard while crafting out of it.
[02:21:27.850 --> 02:21:29.570]  So keep you know, keep in touch.
[02:21:29.570 --> 02:21:30.570]  We'll get you hooked up.
[02:21:31.330 --> 02:21:32.490]  But go back to that slab.
[02:21:32.490 --> 02:21:34.010]  And that was fucking gorgeous.
[02:21:34.330 --> 02:21:35.250]  Yeah, man.
[02:21:35.250 --> 02:21:37.250]  I am like so stoked that this
[02:21:37.250 --> 02:21:39.210]  is like going to be my, you
[02:21:39.210 --> 02:21:41.290]  know, head stash for quite
[02:21:41.290 --> 02:21:42.610]  some time, probably until this time
[02:21:42.610 --> 02:21:43.610]  next year.
[02:21:44.210 --> 02:21:45.210]  And just that that.
[02:21:46.050 --> 02:21:47.450]  I'm going to be doing a lot of
[02:21:48.250 --> 02:21:50.290]  the fresh frozen process and
[02:21:50.570 --> 02:21:52.050]  how these guys, you know, the
[02:21:52.050 --> 02:21:54.410]  temperature and length
[02:21:54.610 --> 02:21:56.290]  these guys press this stuff at.
[02:21:56.810 --> 02:21:58.690]  They've really just captured the
[02:21:58.690 --> 02:21:59.690]  plant's essence.
[02:22:00.570 --> 02:22:02.290]  You know, it's it's just smells
[02:22:02.290 --> 02:22:04.130]  exactly how it smelled in the
[02:22:04.130 --> 02:22:04.970]  ground.
[02:22:04.970 --> 02:22:07.050]  And it tastes just the way it tastes
[02:22:07.050 --> 02:22:08.050]  is so
[02:22:08.810 --> 02:22:10.930]  I like really I think a lot of people
[02:22:10.930 --> 02:22:12.490]  like, you know, that that jelly
[02:22:12.490 --> 02:22:14.530]  rancher strain, it's it's no joke,
[02:22:14.530 --> 02:22:16.170]  man. It really is like something
[02:22:16.170 --> 02:22:17.010]  unique.
[02:22:17.010 --> 02:22:18.730]  Everybody who smoked the flower
[02:22:18.730 --> 02:22:20.090]  from it has just been
[02:22:20.610 --> 02:22:22.090]  like, you know, I don't tell them
[02:22:22.090 --> 02:22:23.690]  what it is. I don't show me.
[02:22:23.690 --> 02:22:25.210]  I just roll up a nice joint
[02:22:25.610 --> 02:22:27.610]  and every single time
[02:22:27.610 --> 02:22:29.530]  someone's just like, oh, yeah.
[02:22:29.530 --> 02:22:30.450]  Like, what is this?
[02:22:30.450 --> 02:22:31.370]  This is amazing.
[02:22:31.370 --> 02:22:33.690]  So that's that's one I definitely
[02:22:33.930 --> 02:22:35.530]  really recommend to people.
[02:22:36.170 --> 02:22:37.610]  Those are Humboldt's genetics.
[02:22:37.770 --> 02:22:39.610]  The Humboldt Tea Company.
[02:22:39.650 --> 02:22:41.650]  Yeah, they
[02:22:41.650 --> 02:22:42.650]  knocked it out of the park with
[02:22:42.650 --> 02:22:43.690]  that one for sure.
[02:22:43.810 --> 02:22:44.810]  And let me
[02:22:45.370 --> 02:22:46.610]  see, I don't like I said, I don't
[02:22:46.610 --> 02:22:47.970]  know how well the bud
[02:22:48.570 --> 02:22:50.130]  is going to come out on this
[02:22:51.130 --> 02:22:52.330]  with this resolution.
[02:22:52.330 --> 02:22:54.370]  But, you know, here's
[02:22:54.370 --> 02:22:55.650]  like you're not going to be able to
[02:22:55.650 --> 02:22:57.450]  see it really at all.
[02:22:58.370 --> 02:22:59.930]  This is some kind of like train
[02:22:59.930 --> 02:23:01.450]  right cross that I grew.
[02:23:01.730 --> 02:23:03.610]  It's just super dense like this
[02:23:03.610 --> 02:23:05.370]  nugget right here is probably like
[02:23:06.090 --> 02:23:07.810]  like it's over a gram.
[02:23:07.850 --> 02:23:09.210]  It'll break up and this will be
[02:23:09.210 --> 02:23:11.130]  like, you know, like one and a half
[02:23:11.130 --> 02:23:12.130]  solid joint.
[02:23:12.130 --> 02:23:13.130]  Just so dense,
[02:23:14.570 --> 02:23:15.570]  super dense.
[02:23:16.050 --> 02:23:17.450]  Really, you know, that's
[02:23:17.450 --> 02:23:19.250]  testament to the Korean natural
[02:23:19.570 --> 02:23:21.090]  farming and having a dialed in
[02:23:21.090 --> 02:23:22.610]  environment that you can just have
[02:23:22.610 --> 02:23:23.610]  these rock hard,
[02:23:24.530 --> 02:23:26.890]  dense, dank, turpy buds
[02:23:27.210 --> 02:23:29.050]  from from using that system.
[02:23:29.530 --> 02:23:30.970]  And, yeah, the flower is really not
[02:23:30.970 --> 02:23:32.130]  coming out super good.
[02:23:32.170 --> 02:23:33.930]  I'll pull out like a dry farm nugget
[02:23:33.930 --> 02:23:35.930]  to just to just to show
[02:23:35.930 --> 02:23:37.570]  you guys like, you know, this is
[02:23:37.770 --> 02:23:38.850]  there are some nice
[02:23:39.730 --> 02:23:41.130]  flowers that are coming out.
[02:23:41.130 --> 02:23:42.130]  They're nice.
[02:23:42.810 --> 02:23:44.250]  You know, people concerned about the
[02:23:44.250 --> 02:23:46.570]  size of the cannabis,
[02:23:46.570 --> 02:23:48.570]  you know, growing organically or
[02:23:48.570 --> 02:23:50.530]  the quality like rest assured
[02:23:50.530 --> 02:23:51.850]  that there you're not going to have
[02:23:51.850 --> 02:23:53.650]  to sacrifice either if you're
[02:23:53.650 --> 02:23:54.770]  doing it properly.
[02:23:56.490 --> 02:23:57.890]  You know, like this right here, this
[02:23:57.890 --> 02:24:00.210]  is some of the what's
[02:24:00.210 --> 02:24:02.450]  it called? Raspberry parfait.
[02:24:02.770 --> 02:24:04.610]  Super dank, like I said, kind of
[02:24:04.610 --> 02:24:06.850]  Jack Turpeline
[02:24:07.490 --> 02:24:08.690]  kind of aroma to it.
[02:24:08.730 --> 02:24:10.530]  Really great daytime smoke.
[02:24:10.530 --> 02:24:12.210]  The plants were massive.
[02:24:14.050 --> 02:24:16.090]  I wish I yeah, there's a picture of
[02:24:16.090 --> 02:24:18.090]  this this variety on my
[02:24:18.090 --> 02:24:19.090]  Instagram.
[02:24:19.290 --> 02:24:20.970]  And when I'm taking pictures just to
[02:24:20.970 --> 02:24:22.610]  let everybody know I'm just in good
[02:24:22.610 --> 02:24:24.490]  lighting. I'm not there's no
[02:24:24.490 --> 02:24:26.170]  photo shopping going on.
[02:24:26.210 --> 02:24:28.210]  There's no altering
[02:24:28.210 --> 02:24:30.050]  the I'm not touching the Instagram
[02:24:30.050 --> 02:24:31.530]  filters or anything like that.
[02:24:31.570 --> 02:24:33.010]  It's just proper lighting.
[02:24:33.250 --> 02:24:34.890]  And you can kind of see like what
[02:24:34.890 --> 02:24:36.770]  quality you can get, you know,
[02:24:37.690 --> 02:24:40.050]  you know, growing organically
[02:24:41.410 --> 02:24:43.090]  and letting the plant choose what it
[02:24:43.090 --> 02:24:44.090]  wants.
[02:24:44.250 --> 02:24:45.930]  Like I said, I have all this indoor
[02:24:45.930 --> 02:24:47.970]  weed from my last harvest and
[02:24:48.010 --> 02:24:49.650]  I have to force myself to smoke it.
[02:24:49.650 --> 02:24:51.690]  And it's not not because of lack
[02:24:51.690 --> 02:24:53.170]  of quality, just because that
[02:24:53.690 --> 02:24:55.970]  that organic outdoor dry farm,
[02:24:55.970 --> 02:24:57.610]  you know, something about the
[02:24:57.610 --> 02:24:58.850]  spectrum of the sun
[02:24:59.930 --> 02:25:01.730]  being planted in native soil.
[02:25:01.730 --> 02:25:03.690]  It's just really like special,
[02:25:03.690 --> 02:25:04.690]  special.
[02:25:05.730 --> 02:25:07.410]  And I hope I'm going to be at the
[02:25:07.410 --> 02:25:08.730]  cannabis or at that
[02:25:09.730 --> 02:25:10.730]  Emerald Cup.
[02:25:10.890 --> 02:25:12.890]  I'm going to bring a big
[02:25:12.890 --> 02:25:13.890]  old bag.
[02:25:13.930 --> 02:25:15.170]  I'm going to be smoking up with
[02:25:15.170 --> 02:25:17.050]  people. So I want people to be able
[02:25:17.050 --> 02:25:18.730]  to try this stuff and I want to be
[02:25:18.730 --> 02:25:19.930]  able to share it with people because
[02:25:19.930 --> 02:25:21.690]  it is it's like I'm really
[02:25:23.050 --> 02:25:24.050]  I'm proud of it.
[02:25:24.090 --> 02:25:25.690]  But at the same time, like the
[02:25:25.690 --> 02:25:26.930]  plants did the hard work.
[02:25:27.010 --> 02:25:28.290]  The plants and the microbes did the
[02:25:28.290 --> 02:25:29.290]  hard work.
[02:25:29.370 --> 02:25:30.650]  I was just kind of put them in the
[02:25:30.650 --> 02:25:32.130]  ground and made sure everything,
[02:25:32.450 --> 02:25:34.210]  you know, was taken care of and was
[02:25:34.210 --> 02:25:35.210]  doing all right. But,
[02:25:36.170 --> 02:25:38.130]  you know, like I said, yeah,
[02:25:38.570 --> 02:25:40.330]  the plants did the brunt of the work
[02:25:40.330 --> 02:25:41.850]  and the genetics
[02:25:42.090 --> 02:25:43.090]  in that soil.
[02:25:43.090 --> 02:25:44.090]  So
[02:25:45.130 --> 02:25:46.810]  totally I hope that, you know, some
[02:25:46.810 --> 02:25:48.210]  of you guys, if you guys are going to
[02:25:48.210 --> 02:25:50.130]  the Emerald Cup, you guys reach out
[02:25:50.130 --> 02:25:51.890]  to me on Instagram or whatever.
[02:25:52.090 --> 02:25:54.090]  I'd love to meet up with whoever
[02:25:54.090 --> 02:25:55.090]  and just you just
[02:25:56.050 --> 02:25:57.050]  have a nice sesh.
[02:25:58.810 --> 02:26:00.690]  I'm sure people will take you up on
[02:26:00.690 --> 02:26:01.690]  that, man.
[02:26:01.690 --> 02:26:03.210]  I wanted to talk a little more with
[02:26:03.210 --> 02:26:04.210]  the genetics.
[02:26:04.410 --> 02:26:05.850]  Are there other breeders besides?
[02:26:05.850 --> 02:26:07.650]  I feel like, you know, even if you're
[02:26:08.530 --> 02:26:09.850]  a farmer, you know, you're a farmer
[02:26:09.850 --> 02:26:11.330]  and you never really even smoke
[02:26:11.890 --> 02:26:13.570]  cannabis. I feel like those people
[02:26:13.570 --> 02:26:15.410]  have still heard of Humboldt seed or
[02:26:15.450 --> 02:26:16.530]  some variety of that.
[02:26:16.570 --> 02:26:17.770]  Are there some other breeders out
[02:26:17.770 --> 02:26:19.050]  there, especially from where you're
[02:26:19.050 --> 02:26:20.530]  from or other people around the
[02:26:20.530 --> 02:26:22.090]  country, maybe on the East Coast that
[02:26:22.090 --> 02:26:24.090]  you knew that might deserve
[02:26:24.090 --> 02:26:25.690]  a little more credit that that
[02:26:25.690 --> 02:26:27.170]  actually does the work so that,
[02:26:27.170 --> 02:26:28.610]  again, more of the viewers that want
[02:26:28.610 --> 02:26:29.770]  to grow in this manner.
[02:26:29.970 --> 02:26:31.730]  They have a lot of nuances when
[02:26:31.730 --> 02:26:32.730]  they're first taken off.
[02:26:32.770 --> 02:26:34.130]  Right. There's so many kind of
[02:26:34.130 --> 02:26:35.130]  controls, if you will.
[02:26:35.170 --> 02:26:36.650]  They got to dial in the soil
[02:26:36.650 --> 02:26:37.970]  so that I feel like a lot of them,
[02:26:37.970 --> 02:26:39.490]  especially if they buy regular seeds,
[02:26:39.490 --> 02:26:40.890]  might not even know that they have
[02:26:40.890 --> 02:26:42.450]  males until they have an issue or if
[02:26:42.450 --> 02:26:43.650]  they're not really paying attention
[02:26:43.650 --> 02:26:44.650]  like they should be.
[02:26:44.970 --> 02:26:46.330]  There can be a lot of issues with
[02:26:46.330 --> 02:26:48.170]  genetics just from
[02:26:48.490 --> 02:26:50.170]  creating a bad environment or
[02:26:50.210 --> 02:26:51.570]  getting bad information.
[02:26:52.090 --> 02:26:53.330]  That personally happened to me when
[02:26:53.330 --> 02:26:55.130]  I was learning how to farm in a
[02:26:55.130 --> 02:26:56.810]  tent, pumping that shit full of
[02:26:56.810 --> 02:26:58.010]  humidity like an idiot.
[02:26:58.690 --> 02:26:59.970]  But I was given really bad
[02:27:00.330 --> 02:27:01.650]  information from somebody that I
[02:27:01.650 --> 02:27:02.970]  thought I knew what they were
[02:27:02.970 --> 02:27:03.970]  talking about.
[02:27:04.970 --> 02:27:06.370]  So as far as, yeah,
[02:27:06.370 --> 02:27:07.930]  I mean, it's classic.
[02:27:07.930 --> 02:27:09.490]  You have a lot of people who,
[02:27:11.490 --> 02:27:13.490]  the more confident a person is,
[02:27:13.490 --> 02:27:15.010]  a lot of times the less
[02:27:15.570 --> 02:27:16.730]  valuable their input.
[02:27:16.730 --> 02:27:18.730]  Not always, but a lot of times
[02:27:18.730 --> 02:27:20.570]  people who talk the talk don't walk
[02:27:20.570 --> 02:27:21.570]  the walk.
[02:27:22.650 --> 02:27:25.010]  But as far as breeders,
[02:27:25.010 --> 02:27:26.010]  who I really,
[02:27:27.250 --> 02:27:29.410]  really respect their work,
[02:27:29.930 --> 02:27:32.650]  is Stay Fly Farms.
[02:27:32.650 --> 02:27:33.650]  Those guys,
[02:27:34.170 --> 02:27:35.810]  they constantly are releasing
[02:27:35.810 --> 02:27:36.810]  seeds
[02:27:37.970 --> 02:27:39.370]  that just are, that most of their
[02:27:39.370 --> 02:27:40.570]  stuff is grown outdoors.
[02:27:40.610 --> 02:27:42.570]  The stuff looks like indoor
[02:27:42.570 --> 02:27:44.410]  quality. It doesn't get much better
[02:27:44.410 --> 02:27:46.250]  than what they're putting out
[02:27:46.250 --> 02:27:48.410]  as far as just consistent dank.
[02:27:49.650 --> 02:27:51.410]  I really would like to run some of
[02:27:51.410 --> 02:27:52.410]  their stuff.
[02:27:52.890 --> 02:27:54.410]  I haven't yet, but I'm
[02:27:54.410 --> 02:27:56.410]  blown away by looking
[02:27:56.410 --> 02:27:58.410]  at what they, the results
[02:27:58.410 --> 02:27:59.730]  of what other people have done.
[02:28:00.410 --> 02:28:01.930]  And I think it's really important
[02:28:01.930 --> 02:28:03.330]  to look at what other people have
[02:28:03.330 --> 02:28:04.330]  done.
[02:28:05.610 --> 02:28:07.250]  You know, I'm a sucker, like I said
[02:28:07.250 --> 02:28:08.890]  earlier, I'm a sucker for blueberry
[02:28:08.890 --> 02:28:09.890]  turps and, you know,
[02:28:11.130 --> 02:28:12.130]  DJ Short.
[02:28:12.610 --> 02:28:14.450]  DJ Short, he's passed away, but his
[02:28:14.450 --> 02:28:16.250]  son is still really
[02:28:16.250 --> 02:28:17.770]  doing a lot of good work.
[02:28:18.090 --> 02:28:20.170]  And I think he goes by second
[02:28:20.490 --> 02:28:22.210]  generation genetics.
[02:28:22.690 --> 02:28:24.690]  And I just actually grabbed
[02:28:24.690 --> 02:28:26.650]  a pack of cherry pie across with
[02:28:26.650 --> 02:28:28.730]  a DJ Short's blueberry F4
[02:28:29.050 --> 02:28:30.530]  that I'm really excited about.
[02:28:31.930 --> 02:28:33.850]  Well, Todd McCormick at
[02:28:33.850 --> 02:28:34.850]  AgC.co.com.
[02:28:36.970 --> 02:28:37.970]  He's an OG.
[02:28:38.690 --> 02:28:40.570]  You know, he was a drug war
[02:28:40.570 --> 02:28:41.570]  veteran.
[02:28:42.170 --> 02:28:44.250]  He really does a great job at
[02:28:45.050 --> 02:28:46.050]  bringing forth
[02:28:46.850 --> 02:28:48.770]  some older genetics that, you know,
[02:28:49.090 --> 02:28:50.890]  are hard to come by and that
[02:28:50.890 --> 02:28:51.930]  people would really like.
[02:28:51.930 --> 02:28:53.130]  Like, that's where I got my Northern
[02:28:53.130 --> 02:28:54.930]  Lights from, my
[02:28:54.930 --> 02:28:56.050]  skunk from.
[02:28:56.450 --> 02:28:58.450]  I got a granddaddy purple from him.
[02:28:59.410 --> 02:29:00.810]  Some haze crosses.
[02:29:01.930 --> 02:29:03.530]  Original Colombian haze.
[02:29:04.850 --> 02:29:05.850]  Another
[02:29:07.130 --> 02:29:09.290]  list of a couple more rebel grown.
[02:29:09.490 --> 02:29:11.650]  He's down in Southern Humboldt and
[02:29:13.010 --> 02:29:14.930]  he does amazing, amazing
[02:29:14.930 --> 02:29:15.930]  work as well.
[02:29:16.130 --> 02:29:17.130]  He really does.
[02:29:17.810 --> 02:29:19.370]  That name's out there, I think.
[02:29:19.650 --> 02:29:20.170]  Yeah.
[02:29:20.170 --> 02:29:21.170]  Yeah.
[02:29:21.850 --> 02:29:24.090]  And well, it's a couple more
[02:29:25.810 --> 02:29:27.250]  equilibrium genetics.
[02:29:27.770 --> 02:29:29.570]  He does a lot of interesting land
[02:29:29.570 --> 02:29:30.490]  race crosses.
[02:29:30.490 --> 02:29:32.530]  I ran an orange Burmese by him.
[02:29:32.890 --> 02:29:34.650]  It was a Burmese land race crossed
[02:29:34.650 --> 02:29:36.370]  with the African orange, which
[02:29:36.370 --> 02:29:37.370]  was some African
[02:29:38.650 --> 02:29:40.850]  land race crossed with Agent Orange.
[02:29:41.930 --> 02:29:43.970]  Phenomenal, super hardy genetics.
[02:29:44.090 --> 02:29:45.250]  And then one more.
[02:29:46.850 --> 02:29:48.850]  This guy who I've been actually I
[02:29:48.930 --> 02:29:50.770]  met on Clubhouse and he
[02:29:50.770 --> 02:29:51.770]  really, really
[02:29:52.770 --> 02:29:54.450]  knows his stuff and takes a lot of
[02:29:54.450 --> 02:29:55.450]  pride in what he does.
[02:29:55.730 --> 02:29:57.730]  He goes by the name of the Flavor
[02:29:57.730 --> 02:29:59.810]  Meister on IG.
[02:30:00.930 --> 02:30:01.930]  And he I'm
[02:30:03.210 --> 02:30:04.610]  just kind of waiting to get my hands
[02:30:04.610 --> 02:30:05.650]  on some of his genetics.
[02:30:05.890 --> 02:30:07.170]  He puts out some heat
[02:30:08.090 --> 02:30:09.610]  and he's an amazing guy.
[02:30:09.610 --> 02:30:11.770]  Loves to share knowledge with people.
[02:30:13.530 --> 02:30:15.770]  You know, kind of one of the online
[02:30:15.770 --> 02:30:17.330]  community that has come up because
[02:30:17.330 --> 02:30:19.450]  the clubhouse, he's like someone
[02:30:19.450 --> 02:30:21.650]  who I consider like a friend
[02:30:22.130 --> 02:30:23.730]  who I've never met in real life.
[02:30:23.770 --> 02:30:25.810]  But he's like, you know, someone
[02:30:25.810 --> 02:30:27.450]  who I always look forward to talking
[02:30:27.450 --> 02:30:29.050]  to. And it's just
[02:30:29.730 --> 02:30:31.810]  yeah, he's a very forthcoming guy.
[02:30:31.810 --> 02:30:32.810]  He'll help you out.
[02:30:33.010 --> 02:30:34.930]  He's always helping new growers out,
[02:30:35.610 --> 02:30:37.370]  you know, just just out of the
[02:30:37.530 --> 02:30:39.210]  because he's passionate and he sees
[02:30:39.210 --> 02:30:40.530]  the passion of other people and he
[02:30:40.530 --> 02:30:42.570]  wants to he wants to be
[02:30:42.570 --> 02:30:44.130]  a helpful figure in the community.
[02:30:44.130 --> 02:30:46.410]  So, yeah, all those options
[02:30:46.410 --> 02:30:47.930]  there and there's plenty of others.
[02:30:48.290 --> 02:30:49.570]  Those are just the ones I could think
[02:30:49.570 --> 02:30:51.090]  of off the top of my head right now
[02:30:51.530 --> 02:30:53.050]  who really, really
[02:30:54.610 --> 02:30:56.610]  kind of deserve a
[02:30:56.610 --> 02:30:57.690]  shout out, I think.
[02:30:58.690 --> 02:31:00.730]  Yeah, we appreciate that, and I hope
[02:31:00.730 --> 02:31:02.890]  that we can kind of drum up just
[02:31:03.730 --> 02:31:05.810]  hype or whatever, whatever somebody
[02:31:05.810 --> 02:31:08.050]  would need, because it once somebody
[02:31:08.050 --> 02:31:09.450]  with quality work,
[02:31:10.330 --> 02:31:12.050]  you know, the right crowd kind of
[02:31:12.050 --> 02:31:13.050]  picks up on that.
[02:31:13.890 --> 02:31:15.210]  It takes off on its own.
[02:31:15.930 --> 02:31:17.850]  So just sometimes having quality
[02:31:17.850 --> 02:31:19.730]  brand and not anybody knowing about
[02:31:19.730 --> 02:31:21.810]  it at first, that is that is the big
[02:31:21.810 --> 02:31:23.250]  mountain. But I feel like a lot of the
[02:31:23.250 --> 02:31:24.810]  quality always shines through.
[02:31:25.410 --> 02:31:26.810]  So shout out to the
[02:31:27.130 --> 02:31:28.130]  you know, the
[02:31:29.130 --> 02:31:30.410]  you guys still kind of consider that,
[02:31:30.410 --> 02:31:31.930]  like the gray market where people
[02:31:31.930 --> 02:31:32.770]  people are known.
[02:31:32.770 --> 02:31:34.330]  But at the same time, it's not like,
[02:31:34.330 --> 02:31:35.610]  you know, your stuff's not in the
[02:31:35.610 --> 02:31:37.450]  dispensary, but the town
[02:31:37.450 --> 02:31:39.130]  still recognizes you as like
[02:31:39.970 --> 02:31:41.210]  one of the ones doing the work.
[02:31:43.290 --> 02:31:44.650]  Yeah, they're just in the scene, you
[02:31:44.650 --> 02:31:46.490]  know, whatever
[02:31:46.890 --> 02:31:48.490]  market they're catering to.
[02:31:49.490 --> 02:31:51.250]  As far as, you know, putting out
[02:31:51.250 --> 02:31:53.250]  their genetics, they all
[02:31:53.490 --> 02:31:55.730]  they all are, you know, really
[02:31:56.050 --> 02:31:57.690]  excellent, great people in the
[02:31:57.690 --> 02:31:59.770]  community who do amazing,
[02:31:59.810 --> 02:32:00.810]  amazing work.
[02:32:04.880 --> 02:32:06.640]  Well, once again, Brian, I think you
[02:32:06.640 --> 02:32:08.480]  brought a great star, a great
[02:32:09.400 --> 02:32:11.280]  speaker here today and dropping
[02:32:11.280 --> 02:32:13.240]  some other names that we haven't
[02:32:13.240 --> 02:32:15.080]  really brought up in the past
[02:32:15.080 --> 02:32:17.000]  as far as safe places to
[02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:19.320]  purchase solid genetics
[02:32:19.320 --> 02:32:20.200]  without getting fucked.
[02:32:20.200 --> 02:32:21.640]  And of course, we got Peter Dagger
[02:32:21.640 --> 02:32:23.920]  Love here who will handle
[02:32:23.920 --> 02:32:24.920]  your needs.
[02:32:25.400 --> 02:32:26.920]  So don't hesitate to reach out to
[02:32:26.920 --> 02:32:27.920]  him either.
[02:32:29.880 --> 02:32:31.600]  Yeah, I just feel like unless you're
[02:32:31.600 --> 02:32:32.600]  on Instagram,
[02:32:33.600 --> 02:32:35.040]  sadly, it's kind of like, well,
[02:32:35.040 --> 02:32:36.920]  where do where do the people that's
[02:32:36.920 --> 02:32:38.880]  not kind of in that little other
[02:32:38.880 --> 02:32:40.280]  circle that knows about other
[02:32:40.280 --> 02:32:42.160]  genetics, knows about maybe
[02:32:42.160 --> 02:32:44.000]  the history of cannabis when
[02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:45.080]  they first get into farming?
[02:32:45.080 --> 02:32:47.040]  I'm sure it's pretty hard not to
[02:32:47.040 --> 02:32:48.040]  just want to go.
[02:32:48.400 --> 02:32:49.800]  I mean, if you've been to an expo,
[02:32:49.800 --> 02:32:51.280]  you can really see the difference.
[02:32:51.280 --> 02:32:52.840]  They'll be really quality.
[02:32:53.840 --> 02:32:56.640]  I feel like admired in a way,
[02:32:56.640 --> 02:32:58.240]  people here in Colorado at some of
[02:32:58.240 --> 02:32:59.880]  these older Indo expos and that
[02:32:59.880 --> 02:33:00.760]  kind of thing.
[02:33:00.760 --> 02:33:01.480]  And then there'd be other
[02:33:01.480 --> 02:33:03.160]  individuals with just lines out
[02:33:03.160 --> 02:33:04.920]  the door, not to say that their
[02:33:04.920 --> 02:33:06.080]  stuff isn't warranted.
[02:33:06.080 --> 02:33:07.640]  It's just it's just really weird
[02:33:07.640 --> 02:33:08.880]  when it's like, wow, that work is
[02:33:08.880 --> 02:33:10.840]  probably at the same level,
[02:33:10.840 --> 02:33:12.480]  but maybe the hype isn't there for
[02:33:12.480 --> 02:33:13.240]  that individual.
[02:33:13.240 --> 02:33:15.040]  And it's just a drastic difference.
[02:33:15.040 --> 02:33:16.840]  And I mean, people at one
[02:33:16.840 --> 02:33:18.160]  point, I think it was like twenty
[02:33:18.160 --> 02:33:20.160]  nineteen were waiting for
[02:33:20.160 --> 02:33:22.040]  a capulator individual
[02:33:22.080 --> 02:33:24.160]  where they were waiting three hours
[02:33:24.160 --> 02:33:26.080]  to get some seeds from that aspect.
[02:33:26.080 --> 02:33:28.720]  And it was it was really
[02:33:28.720 --> 02:33:30.520]  interesting to see
[02:33:30.520 --> 02:33:32.280]  like what what people really felt
[02:33:32.280 --> 02:33:34.400]  like the Mac, the Mac and
[02:33:34.400 --> 02:33:35.400]  cheese.
[02:33:35.640 --> 02:33:37.120]  And again, not to say that the
[02:33:37.120 --> 02:33:38.560]  female hunting other people's
[02:33:38.560 --> 02:33:40.520]  genetics and going with the hype
[02:33:40.520 --> 02:33:42.760]  sometimes probably could pay off,
[02:33:42.760 --> 02:33:44.080]  especially when it's first dropped
[02:33:44.080 --> 02:33:45.080]  on the market.
[02:33:45.640 --> 02:33:47.280]  But there's just so many other
[02:33:47.280 --> 02:33:49.680]  fantastic breeders out there that
[02:33:49.680 --> 02:33:51.480]  no one knows about or
[02:33:51.480 --> 02:33:52.600]  very few know about.
[02:33:56.120 --> 02:33:56.880]  Yeah, I agree.
[02:33:56.880 --> 02:33:59.000]  There's a lot of it's who you know
[02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:00.720]  and who knows you and if you rode
[02:34:00.720 --> 02:34:02.560]  the hype train, how many followers
[02:34:02.560 --> 02:34:05.400]  you have. And that's not
[02:34:05.400 --> 02:34:08.440]  necessarily an indicator of quality
[02:34:08.440 --> 02:34:09.760]  integrity in your work
[02:34:11.400 --> 02:34:13.360]  or yeah, just it's it really is.
[02:34:13.360 --> 02:34:14.680]  And like there's a lot of people who
[02:34:14.680 --> 02:34:16.320]  deserve a lot more credit than they
[02:34:16.320 --> 02:34:18.000]  get. So, yeah,
[02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:20.000]  and those, like I said, were just
[02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.080]  a few of, you know, many,
[02:34:22.080 --> 02:34:23.960]  many people who deserve like a
[02:34:23.960 --> 02:34:25.760]  shout out and to be recognized for
[02:34:25.760 --> 02:34:26.760]  their work.
[02:34:28.160 --> 02:34:29.680]  But yeah, in this industry, it is
[02:34:29.680 --> 02:34:31.040]  largely hype driven.
[02:34:32.160 --> 02:34:33.400]  A lot of times you can have great
[02:34:33.400 --> 02:34:34.640]  genetics and if you don't have a
[02:34:34.640 --> 02:34:36.480]  good name for it, people
[02:34:36.480 --> 02:34:37.880]  won't even give it the time of day,
[02:34:37.880 --> 02:34:39.760]  which is how silly is that?
[02:34:41.240 --> 02:34:42.520]  So, yeah, there's a lot of
[02:34:42.520 --> 02:34:44.720]  superficial aspects
[02:34:44.720 --> 02:34:47.040]  to to the industry
[02:34:47.040 --> 02:34:48.720]  that I hope that people can
[02:34:48.720 --> 02:34:50.800]  overlook and
[02:34:50.800 --> 02:34:52.200]  really kind of scratch beneath the
[02:34:52.200 --> 02:34:53.200]  surface a little bit.
[02:34:55.880 --> 02:34:57.400]  Hey, Johnny, are you going to enter
[02:34:57.400 --> 02:34:59.400]  anything in the cup this year?
[02:34:59.400 --> 02:35:01.360]  Yep, I am going to
[02:35:01.360 --> 02:35:03.680]  enter that special
[02:35:03.680 --> 02:35:05.680]  lemongrass Fino as
[02:35:05.680 --> 02:35:07.520]  hard as it is for me to part with 50
[02:35:07.520 --> 02:35:09.320]  grams for my head
[02:35:09.320 --> 02:35:11.200]  stash. I'm going to I'm
[02:35:11.200 --> 02:35:12.000]  going to enter that.
[02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:13.920]  And then also I'm
[02:35:13.920 --> 02:35:16.080]  going to enter the raspberry
[02:35:16.080 --> 02:35:18.000]  parfait and maybe some of the
[02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:19.880]  Jolly Rancher flower and
[02:35:19.880 --> 02:35:21.200]  then the people who are running and
[02:35:21.200 --> 02:35:22.160]  doing the extract.
[02:35:22.160 --> 02:35:23.800]  I'm hoping that they put that
[02:35:23.800 --> 02:35:25.440]  Jolly Rancher rosin in there
[02:35:25.440 --> 02:35:27.200]  because, yeah, that stuff
[02:35:27.200 --> 02:35:29.680]  is it's fucking dank.
[02:35:29.680 --> 02:35:31.080]  I've definitely bought some hundred
[02:35:31.080 --> 02:35:34.000]  gram or hundred dollar a gram
[02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:36.280]  rosin from dispensaries
[02:35:36.280 --> 02:35:39.080]  and been like really disappointed.
[02:35:39.080 --> 02:35:41.120]  Just lackluster turps.
[02:35:41.120 --> 02:35:43.000]  This stuff is just it's nice.
[02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:45.480]  Smells like a fresh
[02:35:45.480 --> 02:35:47.360]  fruit, not like a
[02:35:47.360 --> 02:35:48.640]  synthetic weird thing.
[02:35:48.640 --> 02:35:50.960]  It just smells like delicious
[02:35:50.960 --> 02:35:51.960]  nature's candy.
[02:35:53.320 --> 02:35:54.800]  So, yeah, I'm hoping that they enter
[02:35:54.800 --> 02:35:56.960]  that because it really is super
[02:35:56.960 --> 02:35:57.960]  great quality
[02:35:59.280 --> 02:36:01.240]  and they do amazing work with their
[02:36:01.240 --> 02:36:02.280]  extract process.
[02:36:02.280 --> 02:36:03.400]  But yeah, I'm looking forward.
[02:36:03.400 --> 02:36:05.280]  This is the first year in.
[02:36:05.280 --> 02:36:06.920]  I've wanted to go to the Emerald Cup
[02:36:06.920 --> 02:36:08.560]  pretty much every single year since
[02:36:08.560 --> 02:36:10.200]  I've gotten to California.
[02:36:10.200 --> 02:36:12.040]  But I've always just been like on
[02:36:12.040 --> 02:36:14.040]  the hill working, cutting
[02:36:14.040 --> 02:36:16.000]  clones for the wintertime, taking
[02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:16.800]  care of moms.
[02:36:16.800 --> 02:36:18.920]  And I've never had the kind of
[02:36:18.920 --> 02:36:19.920]  the R&R
[02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:22.840]  that I could
[02:36:22.840 --> 02:36:24.720]  have used. But now finally, I feel
[02:36:24.720 --> 02:36:26.840]  like, you know, this is a golden
[02:36:26.840 --> 02:36:27.640]  opportunity.
[02:36:27.640 --> 02:36:29.560]  I have a few months off to rest and
[02:36:29.560 --> 02:36:31.200]  relax and I'm going to take the time
[02:36:31.200 --> 02:36:33.080]  to to go there and
[02:36:33.080 --> 02:36:34.800]  or meet up with a lot of people who
[02:36:34.800 --> 02:36:37.280]  I've never actually
[02:36:37.280 --> 02:36:39.360]  met face to face and have
[02:36:39.360 --> 02:36:40.360]  had these great,
[02:36:41.480 --> 02:36:42.840]  you know, I have like a fortunate
[02:36:42.840 --> 02:36:44.840]  relationship with these people.
[02:36:44.840 --> 02:36:46.680]  So I'm really looking forward to
[02:36:46.680 --> 02:36:48.160]  that to go in.
[02:36:48.160 --> 02:36:50.200]  So, yeah, I hope that
[02:36:50.200 --> 02:36:51.520]  Leighton, you thinking about going?
[02:36:53.840 --> 02:36:55.640]  You know, I
[02:36:55.640 --> 02:36:57.160]  am on the fence whether I'm going to
[02:36:57.160 --> 02:36:59.320]  make the jaunt up there or not.
[02:36:59.320 --> 02:37:01.160]  It's been a couple of years since
[02:37:01.160 --> 02:37:02.160]  I last gone,
[02:37:03.120 --> 02:37:04.800]  but it is it's a lot of fun.
[02:37:04.800 --> 02:37:06.280]  And like you said, you know, I'm
[02:37:06.280 --> 02:37:07.600]  really happy to hear that you're
[02:37:07.600 --> 02:37:08.600]  actually going to have some R&R
[02:37:10.200 --> 02:37:11.720]  because life is a grind.
[02:37:13.240 --> 02:37:14.640]  The fucking struggle is real.
[02:37:15.640 --> 02:37:16.640]  100 percent, man.
[02:37:16.640 --> 02:37:17.640]  You want to start
[02:37:18.640 --> 02:37:19.640]  diving into.
[02:37:23.480 --> 02:37:24.480]  Sorry, I'm sorry.
[02:37:24.480 --> 02:37:25.480]  You got to know everybody.
[02:37:25.480 --> 02:37:26.440]  You want to you want to get into
[02:37:26.440 --> 02:37:27.440]  some questions?
[02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:30.840]  Did he said get in question into
[02:37:30.840 --> 02:37:31.840]  questions?
[02:37:31.840 --> 02:37:33.560]  Yeah, he just said, let's dive into
[02:37:33.560 --> 02:37:35.120]  questions and Guillermo.
[02:37:35.120 --> 02:37:37.080]  Yes, I do ship to Mexico.
[02:37:37.080 --> 02:37:38.920]  I'm standing by to take your order.
[02:37:42.880 --> 02:37:43.880]  So we all right.
[02:37:44.480 --> 02:37:45.480]  But both.
[02:37:48.880 --> 02:37:49.880]  And I mean,
[02:37:50.880 --> 02:37:52.600]  if I can pull a surprise guest on,
[02:37:52.600 --> 02:37:53.760]  we may blow your mind.
[02:37:56.640 --> 02:37:58.520]  So I think Leighton answered
[02:37:58.520 --> 02:38:00.000]  this for you, but do you test the
[02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:01.000]  soil?
[02:38:01.040 --> 02:38:02.360]  I think you said you want to, but
[02:38:02.360 --> 02:38:03.360]  you haven't yet. Right.
[02:38:04.440 --> 02:38:06.200]  There was a soil test, so we
[02:38:06.200 --> 02:38:08.160]  kind of I got put on the job
[02:38:09.120 --> 02:38:10.120]  last minute
[02:38:11.240 --> 02:38:13.120]  where someone else was supposed
[02:38:13.120 --> 02:38:14.600]  to be on the project and he ended
[02:38:14.600 --> 02:38:15.600]  up kind of bailing.
[02:38:16.120 --> 02:38:17.640]  So there was a soil analysis
[02:38:17.960 --> 02:38:18.960]  ran and it was I
[02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:21.720]  hadn't seen it personally, but the
[02:38:21.720 --> 02:38:22.720]  consultant said
[02:38:23.720 --> 02:38:25.280]  that everything checked out and was
[02:38:25.280 --> 02:38:26.280]  looking pretty good.
[02:38:27.040 --> 02:38:28.680]  And this this year during the
[02:38:28.680 --> 02:38:30.360]  offseason, yeah, 100 percent.
[02:38:30.360 --> 02:38:32.160]  We're going to get a soil test done
[02:38:32.160 --> 02:38:33.720]  and just and kind of see where we're
[02:38:33.720 --> 02:38:34.720]  at.
[02:38:34.760 --> 02:38:36.760]  I think, you know, I know
[02:38:36.760 --> 02:38:38.480]  a lot of people who don't do it and
[02:38:38.480 --> 02:38:39.880]  they get away with it.
[02:38:39.880 --> 02:38:41.320]  But I think that it's just better
[02:38:41.320 --> 02:38:42.320]  safe than sorry.
[02:38:43.320 --> 02:38:44.920]  It's just good practice to do this
[02:38:44.960 --> 02:38:46.320]  practice to do even if you don't
[02:38:46.320 --> 02:38:47.840]  have to do anything just to know
[02:38:47.840 --> 02:38:48.840]  where you're at.
[02:38:50.120 --> 02:38:52.200]  So, yes, 100 percent soil test
[02:38:52.240 --> 02:38:53.720]  is happening in the very near
[02:38:53.720 --> 02:38:54.720]  future.
[02:38:57.150 --> 02:38:58.950]  OK, Valentino is looking for
[02:38:58.950 --> 02:39:00.270]  safety scissors.
[02:39:03.310 --> 02:39:04.830]  I just lost all my questions.
[02:39:05.070 --> 02:39:06.070]  Hold on.
[02:39:08.190 --> 02:39:09.870]  OK, so.
[02:39:11.910 --> 02:39:13.270]  All right, Peter, while you dig that
[02:39:13.270 --> 02:39:15.270]  up, I saw I saw a question
[02:39:15.270 --> 02:39:16.270]  earlier.
[02:39:17.030 --> 02:39:18.510]  About photos, though, it's
[02:39:19.510 --> 02:39:21.150]  the photos of it is when you get up
[02:39:21.150 --> 02:39:22.950]  at sunrise or just before you go
[02:39:22.950 --> 02:39:25.030]  out and collect you covered
[02:39:25.030 --> 02:39:26.030]  grasses and then you
[02:39:26.950 --> 02:39:28.670]  put them in a bucket and you let
[02:39:28.670 --> 02:39:30.950]  them sit in a bucket for about 24
[02:39:30.950 --> 02:39:32.950]  hours and they'll grow
[02:39:32.950 --> 02:39:34.990]  out. Now, if you want, that's
[02:39:34.990 --> 02:39:36.270]  just a protozoa.
[02:39:36.310 --> 02:39:38.110]  That's a local indigenous protozoa.
[02:39:38.190 --> 02:39:39.310]  You want diversity.
[02:39:39.750 --> 02:39:41.270]  This group dot com.
[02:39:41.750 --> 02:39:43.750]  All flow the amount of fucking
[02:39:43.750 --> 02:39:45.230]  biology you get in that shit.
[02:39:45.590 --> 02:39:47.750]  We'll kick ass to any protozoa
[02:39:47.750 --> 02:39:48.830]  and tea that you can make.
[02:39:49.270 --> 02:39:50.830]  But if you're if you're out in the
[02:39:50.830 --> 02:39:52.070]  woods and you really want to stay
[02:39:52.070 --> 02:39:53.630]  natural, then, yeah, that's the way
[02:39:53.630 --> 02:39:54.630]  to make a photo zone.
[02:39:58.000 --> 02:39:59.600]  Hey, to follow up from yesterday,
[02:39:59.640 --> 02:40:00.800]  just real quick with that latent,
[02:40:00.800 --> 02:40:01.720]  there was a question.
[02:40:01.720 --> 02:40:03.800]  Is there any company that sells
[02:40:03.800 --> 02:40:05.320]  protozoa? And as far as we
[02:40:05.320 --> 02:40:07.080]  understood yesterday, there isn't.
[02:40:07.120 --> 02:40:09.280]  You got to get it from compost.
[02:40:09.400 --> 02:40:10.440]  Is that correct?
[02:40:11.720 --> 02:40:12.920]  No, that is incorrect.
[02:40:13.160 --> 02:40:14.920]  I sell protozoa and
[02:40:14.920 --> 02:40:15.920]  fish.
[02:40:16.800 --> 02:40:18.120]  Gosh, I'm
[02:40:18.120 --> 02:40:19.000]  one of the only one is
[02:40:20.440 --> 02:40:22.240]  well, no, not just you
[02:40:22.240 --> 02:40:23.560]  want. You want the whole community.
[02:40:23.600 --> 02:40:24.600]  Come here.
[02:40:24.880 --> 02:40:27.040]  OK, you nobody sells just
[02:40:27.040 --> 02:40:29.120]  protozoa that would have to be grown
[02:40:29.120 --> 02:40:29.960]  in a lab.
[02:40:29.960 --> 02:40:31.720]  And then, you know, the results
[02:40:32.200 --> 02:40:34.200]  any time you grow in
[02:40:34.200 --> 02:40:35.720]  vitro, you're you're not going to
[02:40:35.720 --> 02:40:37.560]  have an organism that's sustainable
[02:40:37.560 --> 02:40:38.600]  in the real world.
[02:40:39.240 --> 02:40:40.680]  So you need the community.
[02:40:40.680 --> 02:40:42.120]  You need the support mechanism.
[02:40:42.160 --> 02:40:43.720]  You need everything around them, not
[02:40:43.720 --> 02:40:45.080]  just themselves.
[02:40:45.360 --> 02:40:46.360]  But that helps.
[02:40:47.760 --> 02:40:49.120]  Absolutely appreciate that.
[02:40:49.680 --> 02:40:50.680]  I get it.
[02:40:54.120 --> 02:40:55.120]  Rough life.
[02:40:57.840 --> 02:40:59.720]  That's Valentina, daughter, number
[02:40:59.720 --> 02:41:00.720]  two.
[02:41:02.640 --> 02:41:03.840]  Three, I can't believe it.
[02:41:05.440 --> 02:41:06.680]  Do you have those questions popped
[02:41:06.680 --> 02:41:08.480]  up or I know you had you had a
[02:41:08.480 --> 02:41:10.680]  couple other ones like the Wakanda
[02:41:10.760 --> 02:41:12.720]  Kushman years old, pink
[02:41:12.720 --> 02:41:14.760]  rosé and the melon bread.
[02:41:16.680 --> 02:41:18.320]  Are those different
[02:41:18.520 --> 02:41:20.440]  breeders or those all also from
[02:41:20.440 --> 02:41:21.920]  like out in Humboldt?
[02:41:22.760 --> 02:41:24.760]  Those are all just cuts that are
[02:41:25.840 --> 02:41:27.880]  are floating around Humboldt that
[02:41:27.880 --> 02:41:29.680]  I was lucky enough to get my hands
[02:41:29.680 --> 02:41:30.680]  on.
[02:41:30.880 --> 02:41:32.600]  I really feel blessed to be where
[02:41:32.640 --> 02:41:34.120]  I'm at because it's such a genetic
[02:41:34.120 --> 02:41:35.120]  hotbed where
[02:41:36.160 --> 02:41:37.840]  I know a lot of my my friends back
[02:41:37.840 --> 02:41:39.280]  in New York, they're kind of stuck
[02:41:39.280 --> 02:41:41.200]  to growing what's around
[02:41:41.200 --> 02:41:43.000]  or ordering out for seeds
[02:41:43.320 --> 02:41:45.040]  where Humboldt is just the others,
[02:41:45.040 --> 02:41:47.080]  all the latest and greatest
[02:41:47.080 --> 02:41:48.240]  and not so greatest.
[02:41:48.600 --> 02:41:49.600]  Pretty much
[02:41:50.240 --> 02:41:51.720]  everything floating around here.
[02:41:51.760 --> 02:41:52.760]  It's definitely it's
[02:41:53.680 --> 02:41:55.520]  nice to have so many options
[02:41:55.520 --> 02:41:57.560]  of cuts that that are floating
[02:41:57.560 --> 02:41:59.160]  around. And really, it's kind of the
[02:41:59.160 --> 02:42:01.000]  epicenter for the nation.
[02:42:01.360 --> 02:42:03.240]  A lot of things that start here kind
[02:42:03.240 --> 02:42:04.880]  of they do just that they start
[02:42:04.880 --> 02:42:06.360]  here and then they slowly make
[02:42:06.680 --> 02:42:08.800]  their way to various
[02:42:08.800 --> 02:42:09.800]  spots.
[02:42:10.760 --> 02:42:12.720]  But yeah, I really like
[02:42:12.720 --> 02:42:14.280]  that Wakanda a lot and
[02:42:14.560 --> 02:42:16.000]  late in that is a purple punch
[02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:17.000]  cross, actually,
[02:42:17.800 --> 02:42:19.400]  but it's a purple punch cross with
[02:42:19.400 --> 02:42:20.680]  Nigerian silver.
[02:42:21.040 --> 02:42:23.080]  So it's got some kind of land racy
[02:42:23.080 --> 02:42:23.920]  aspect to it.
[02:42:23.920 --> 02:42:25.800]  And it's definitely on the
[02:42:25.800 --> 02:42:26.960]  terpene profile.
[02:42:26.960 --> 02:42:29.080]  It's got kind of that old school,
[02:42:29.720 --> 02:42:32.120]  like kind of hazy,
[02:42:33.080 --> 02:42:35.200]  spicy kind of flavor
[02:42:35.200 --> 02:42:36.800]  to it where it's definitely
[02:42:37.200 --> 02:42:39.120]  way, way better than the purple
[02:42:39.120 --> 02:42:40.400]  punch. That's for sure.
[02:42:42.920 --> 02:42:44.080]  I'm glad to hear that.
[02:42:44.840 --> 02:42:45.960]  You ever heard of a dude named
[02:42:45.960 --> 02:42:46.960]  Cali outdoor?
[02:42:48.880 --> 02:42:50.760]  Yes, I believe so.
[02:42:50.800 --> 02:42:52.560]  I think I follow him on I.G.
[02:42:53.120 --> 02:42:54.840]  He is. I don't know if he still does
[02:42:54.840 --> 02:42:56.320]  it, but he's like a troll to the
[02:42:56.320 --> 02:42:57.720]  everybody. But he was
[02:42:58.240 --> 02:42:59.920]  riding that train pretty hard with
[02:42:59.920 --> 02:43:01.600]  the power, the purple punch.
[02:43:01.960 --> 02:43:03.320]  So I always wondered what happened
[02:43:03.320 --> 02:43:04.320]  to that. But
[02:43:05.400 --> 02:43:06.920]  a lot of people used to kind of play
[02:43:06.920 --> 02:43:07.920]  on that.
[02:43:08.440 --> 02:43:10.280]  I think it was calm, I went one
[02:43:10.280 --> 02:43:12.120]  day and like flipped over his table
[02:43:12.120 --> 02:43:13.680]  and I don't know if that shit was
[02:43:14.080 --> 02:43:15.920]  staged or not or whatever, but it was
[02:43:15.920 --> 02:43:16.920]  pretty interesting.
[02:43:17.880 --> 02:43:19.840]  I've never seen I know
[02:43:19.880 --> 02:43:21.040]  there's beefs out there, but I've
[02:43:21.040 --> 02:43:22.640]  never seen it where like people at an
[02:43:22.640 --> 02:43:24.400]  expo just go and flip over somebody's
[02:43:24.400 --> 02:43:25.320]  table.
[02:43:25.320 --> 02:43:26.320]  That seems pretty
[02:43:27.320 --> 02:43:28.560]  seems pretty legit, I guess.
[02:43:29.600 --> 02:43:31.280]  It could be. Yeah, it could be clout
[02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:33.520]  a stage thing, you know,
[02:43:34.040 --> 02:43:35.720]  a little hip hop feud or something.
[02:43:36.240 --> 02:43:37.240]  Yeah.
[02:43:37.360 --> 02:43:38.600]  Stay out of Tacoma.
[02:43:38.600 --> 02:43:39.600]  Shout out to.
[02:43:39.640 --> 02:43:40.960]  Well, I don't really like Cali
[02:43:40.960 --> 02:43:42.840]  outdoor, but I guess
[02:43:42.840 --> 02:43:44.240]  I gave him a little press today, but
[02:43:44.240 --> 02:43:45.480]  he was big on that power.
[02:43:45.720 --> 02:43:46.720]  The purple punch.
[02:43:46.760 --> 02:43:48.080]  Just talking about how it's going to
[02:43:48.800 --> 02:43:50.800]  make the way or build the wave.
[02:43:50.800 --> 02:43:51.800]  And
[02:43:52.280 --> 02:43:53.280]  people love it.
[02:43:54.160 --> 02:43:55.920]  I have a buddy who really, really
[02:43:55.920 --> 02:43:57.680]  loves purple punch and purple punch
[02:43:57.680 --> 02:43:58.680]  crosses.
[02:43:58.920 --> 02:44:00.800]  And I always bust his balls.
[02:44:00.840 --> 02:44:02.040]  You know, it's just teasing.
[02:44:02.040 --> 02:44:03.840]  But I'm always like, you're
[02:44:03.880 --> 02:44:04.920]  such a heady guy.
[02:44:04.920 --> 02:44:06.560]  But you're really like your genetics.
[02:44:06.560 --> 02:44:08.480]  You're kind of seem like a
[02:44:08.480 --> 02:44:09.480]  little custy to me.
[02:44:09.480 --> 02:44:11.320]  And yeah, we always go back.
[02:44:11.320 --> 02:44:13.160]  He loves the purple punch crosses,
[02:44:13.160 --> 02:44:14.040]  though.
[02:44:14.040 --> 02:44:15.480]  And yeah, it's
[02:44:15.480 --> 02:44:17.320]  just it's it's fun, you know, just
[02:44:17.320 --> 02:44:19.000]  teasing and just because honestly,
[02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:20.000]  I'm not going to lie.
[02:44:20.480 --> 02:44:22.240]  One of my buddies, he did grow some
[02:44:22.240 --> 02:44:24.040]  purple punch and I
[02:44:24.040 --> 02:44:25.680]  was pretty surprised.
[02:44:25.680 --> 02:44:26.760]  I'm like, oh, you did it.
[02:44:26.760 --> 02:44:28.200]  You grew the best purple punch I've
[02:44:28.200 --> 02:44:29.000]  ever had.
[02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:30.920]  You know, so kudos to that.
[02:44:31.760 --> 02:44:33.440]  But yeah, more often than not, it's
[02:44:33.440 --> 02:44:35.560]  just not it just looks
[02:44:35.560 --> 02:44:36.960]  good in the bag. It doesn't really
[02:44:36.960 --> 02:44:38.520]  pack pack a punch or
[02:44:39.240 --> 02:44:40.680]  do much for me on the terpene
[02:44:40.720 --> 02:44:41.720]  profile.
[02:44:43.760 --> 02:44:45.400]  And again, that's where Fino
[02:44:45.400 --> 02:44:46.800]  hunting comes in, because if you can
[02:44:46.800 --> 02:44:48.600]  find that bag of peel and it
[02:44:48.600 --> 02:44:50.600]  delivers, holy cow, you got people
[02:44:50.600 --> 02:44:52.160]  driving past other dispensaries and
[02:44:52.160 --> 02:44:53.160]  come get your way.
[02:44:54.200 --> 02:44:55.320]  Yeah, 100 percent.
[02:44:55.320 --> 02:44:56.920]  And there there is I'm sure there
[02:44:56.920 --> 02:44:58.680]  was, you know, something
[02:44:58.680 --> 02:44:59.400]  in it.
[02:44:59.400 --> 02:45:00.520]  If he had a big enough
[02:45:01.400 --> 02:45:03.320]  population size, he would find some
[02:45:03.320 --> 02:45:05.280]  like some of that look
[02:45:05.280 --> 02:45:06.920]  with some of the more like maybe
[02:45:06.920 --> 02:45:08.920]  GDP leaning terpenes
[02:45:08.920 --> 02:45:10.560]  where people would really eat it up.
[02:45:10.680 --> 02:45:12.400]  But, you
[02:45:12.400 --> 02:45:13.440]  know, that's something that would
[02:45:13.440 --> 02:45:15.160]  be it's sad because it really is a
[02:45:15.160 --> 02:45:16.040]  lot of breeding.
[02:45:16.040 --> 02:45:17.880]  It's it's just half
[02:45:17.880 --> 02:45:18.600]  ass.
[02:45:18.600 --> 02:45:20.440]  You know, people just do 20
[02:45:20.440 --> 02:45:21.440]  crosses in a year.
[02:45:21.440 --> 02:45:23.200]  They're not working the lines.
[02:45:23.200 --> 02:45:25.160]  They're not really putting much
[02:45:25.160 --> 02:45:26.560]  thought into it besides, you know,
[02:45:26.560 --> 02:45:27.560]  spraying some
[02:45:29.360 --> 02:45:31.440]  some silver, what STS,
[02:45:31.440 --> 02:45:32.440]  the silver
[02:45:33.320 --> 02:45:35.280]  thios fate or whatever, and
[02:45:35.280 --> 02:45:36.840]  reversing a plant and just chucking
[02:45:36.840 --> 02:45:38.920]  some pollen with, you know,
[02:45:38.920 --> 02:45:40.760]  the two hype strains that they have
[02:45:40.760 --> 02:45:42.680]  on hand and then just selling
[02:45:42.680 --> 02:45:44.600]  packs of seeds for, you know,
[02:45:44.600 --> 02:45:46.680]  200 bucks for a pack of 10.
[02:45:46.680 --> 02:45:48.040]  And I feel like the industry right
[02:45:48.040 --> 02:45:50.600]  now is inundated with that type of
[02:45:50.600 --> 02:45:51.600]  that type of work.
[02:45:52.600 --> 02:45:53.720]  And then do you feel like the
[02:45:53.720 --> 02:45:55.840]  community sometimes feels silly
[02:45:55.840 --> 02:45:57.080]  or something, and then that's why
[02:45:57.080 --> 02:45:58.560]  they don't be like, you know, this
[02:45:58.560 --> 02:46:00.560]  was whack or this was a complete
[02:46:00.560 --> 02:46:01.560]  waste of money
[02:46:02.480 --> 02:46:03.680]  because I don't feel like there's a
[02:46:03.680 --> 02:46:05.000]  lot of follow through on that kind
[02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:06.120]  of stuff.
[02:46:06.120 --> 02:46:07.480]  People just are always on to the
[02:46:07.480 --> 02:46:08.720]  next thing. And it seems like
[02:46:08.720 --> 02:46:10.360]  there's a lot of wasted money.
[02:46:10.360 --> 02:46:12.280]  And granted, I
[02:46:12.280 --> 02:46:13.440]  definitely did that when I was first
[02:46:13.440 --> 02:46:14.560]  getting it. You wanted to buy all
[02:46:14.560 --> 02:46:15.840]  the seeds that you could afford
[02:46:15.840 --> 02:46:16.960]  because you really thought like, oh,
[02:46:16.960 --> 02:46:18.160]  that's the one. And then you go to
[02:46:18.160 --> 02:46:19.000]  another expo.
[02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:20.680]  Oh, this has got to be the one.
[02:46:20.680 --> 02:46:22.560]  And it's hard not to continue doing
[02:46:22.560 --> 02:46:23.720]  that.
[02:46:23.720 --> 02:46:25.240]  So, again, shout out to Daggulov
[02:46:25.240 --> 02:46:27.280]  because he's got all those out there
[02:46:27.280 --> 02:46:28.280]  where you can really
[02:46:29.400 --> 02:46:31.120]  pheno hunt, I feel like is
[02:46:32.040 --> 02:46:33.920]  paramount if you're trying to build
[02:46:33.920 --> 02:46:35.120]  anything for yourself or
[02:46:36.200 --> 02:46:37.800]  otherwise you would have to rely on
[02:46:37.800 --> 02:46:39.280]  gimmicks and tricks and stuff and
[02:46:39.280 --> 02:46:41.280]  marketing. But I guess
[02:46:41.280 --> 02:46:42.920]  you still you always need to rely on
[02:46:42.920 --> 02:46:44.560]  marketing, I feel like, because
[02:46:44.560 --> 02:46:46.040]  there's a lot of quality brands like
[02:46:46.040 --> 02:46:47.320]  you just met up a bunch of different
[02:46:47.320 --> 02:46:49.200]  breeders where, unfortunately, if no
[02:46:49.200 --> 02:46:50.400]  one's ever heard of you, it's really
[02:46:50.400 --> 02:46:52.320]  hard to sell those packs or sell
[02:46:52.320 --> 02:46:53.120]  them for what you deserve.
[02:46:53.120 --> 02:46:54.400]  You feel like you deserve if you
[02:46:54.400 --> 02:46:56.280]  really put in the work and now you
[02:46:56.280 --> 02:46:57.760]  got to lower them to,
[02:46:58.760 --> 02:47:00.360]  I don't know, some some people
[02:47:00.360 --> 02:47:01.320]  where they feel like industry
[02:47:01.320 --> 02:47:02.320]  standard prices.
[02:47:03.200 --> 02:47:05.080]  Yeah, it's a whole other
[02:47:05.080 --> 02:47:06.760]  avenue that a lot of people it
[02:47:06.760 --> 02:47:08.600]  always reminds, I liken it to a
[02:47:08.600 --> 02:47:10.000]  musician or an artist.
[02:47:10.320 --> 02:47:11.880]  You could be an amazing musician,
[02:47:11.880 --> 02:47:14.040]  but, you know, if you
[02:47:14.120 --> 02:47:15.960]  are also selling yourself
[02:47:16.320 --> 02:47:17.840]  and marketing yourself
[02:47:18.160 --> 02:47:19.800]  and same with art, you know, you're
[02:47:19.800 --> 02:47:21.720]  not going to be able to be
[02:47:22.320 --> 02:47:23.440]  you're not going to be able to make
[02:47:23.440 --> 02:47:24.840]  ends meet necessarily.
[02:47:25.120 --> 02:47:26.680]  And it's something that an artist or
[02:47:26.680 --> 02:47:28.000]  a musician, a lot of times they don't
[02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:28.960]  want to have to do that.
[02:47:28.960 --> 02:47:30.200]  They just want to do their art.
[02:47:31.200 --> 02:47:33.040]  But it is it's important to
[02:47:33.040 --> 02:47:34.720]  stay relevant and to be a
[02:47:34.720 --> 02:47:36.640]  known like to be known, at
[02:47:36.640 --> 02:47:38.760]  least enough to to kind
[02:47:38.760 --> 02:47:40.800]  of be able
[02:47:40.800 --> 02:47:42.920]  to, you know, have every
[02:47:42.920 --> 02:47:43.920]  product sell.
[02:47:48.290 --> 02:47:50.290]  So in today's
[02:47:50.330 --> 02:47:52.530]  viewer submission category,
[02:47:52.770 --> 02:47:53.770]  this is
[02:47:56.370 --> 02:47:58.450]  Johnny. Sorry to cut you off, Brian.
[02:47:58.450 --> 02:48:00.730]  Johnny HB's Jelly Rancher.
[02:48:03.410 --> 02:48:04.410]  Look at the rails.
[02:48:05.970 --> 02:48:06.970]  Looking good.
[02:48:07.770 --> 02:48:08.770]  So you want me to throw it?
[02:48:08.770 --> 02:48:10.690]  It has a beautiful structure,
[02:48:10.690 --> 02:48:11.690]  structure to.
[02:48:13.330 --> 02:48:15.250]  We ended up topping the plants one
[02:48:15.250 --> 02:48:17.090]  time, but that was the type of plant
[02:48:17.130 --> 02:48:18.250]  you really don't have to.
[02:48:18.490 --> 02:48:20.650]  It just grows in this or
[02:48:21.610 --> 02:48:23.010]  takes up a lot of real estate.
[02:48:23.050 --> 02:48:25.330]  It's like doesn't get super tall.
[02:48:26.730 --> 02:48:28.450]  There were a few of the, you
[02:48:28.450 --> 02:48:30.090]  know, thousand plants that were,
[02:48:30.090 --> 02:48:32.010]  you know, substantially larger than
[02:48:32.010 --> 02:48:33.010]  the others.
[02:48:33.010 --> 02:48:34.010]  But it's a it's
[02:48:34.890 --> 02:48:37.090]  a great contender for like an indoor
[02:48:37.130 --> 02:48:38.850]  grow, I think, just because of its
[02:48:38.930 --> 02:48:40.810]  its natural structure.
[02:48:45.820 --> 02:48:47.500]  That was definitely mistakes when we,
[02:48:47.540 --> 02:48:49.340]  you know, if you're getting into
[02:48:49.340 --> 02:48:51.260]  this a while ago, is that you didn't
[02:48:51.260 --> 02:48:52.660]  really think about like, OK, I'm
[02:48:52.660 --> 02:48:54.100]  in I'm in a tent or I'm in a
[02:48:54.380 --> 02:48:56.100]  basement with your genetics, you're
[02:48:56.100 --> 02:48:57.620]  just grabbing stuff, whatever.
[02:48:58.380 --> 02:48:59.700]  To be honest, it was like whatever
[02:48:59.700 --> 02:49:02.060]  sounded cool or whoever was seemed
[02:49:02.060 --> 02:49:02.980]  cool. You know, you were always
[02:49:02.980 --> 02:49:04.380]  buying a few of those packs and
[02:49:04.860 --> 02:49:06.020]  like like we had met.
[02:49:06.060 --> 02:49:07.980]  I mean, sometimes they're fantastic.
[02:49:08.020 --> 02:49:09.660]  Some of those genetics kind of do
[02:49:09.660 --> 02:49:11.100]  work out, but a lot of them don't.
[02:49:11.940 --> 02:49:13.380]  And I just don't want the newer
[02:49:13.380 --> 02:49:15.060]  individuals to fall for the same
[02:49:15.060 --> 02:49:17.140]  kind of kind of tricks, I guess.
[02:49:21.440 --> 02:49:23.200]  Yep, these people's job is to sell
[02:49:23.200 --> 02:49:25.280]  you stuff, whether it's seeds,
[02:49:25.280 --> 02:49:27.120]  whether it's nutrients, you know,
[02:49:27.320 --> 02:49:29.000]  they're going to they're going to do
[02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:30.000]  their job.
[02:49:30.640 --> 02:49:32.280]  It's kind of up to you to do due
[02:49:32.280 --> 02:49:34.440]  diligence and buyer beware,
[02:49:34.440 --> 02:49:35.480]  because there's a lot of
[02:49:36.280 --> 02:49:37.280]  a lot of
[02:49:38.680 --> 02:49:40.560]  honest people out there and a lot of
[02:49:40.560 --> 02:49:42.120]  people just trying to get that fast
[02:49:42.120 --> 02:49:44.360]  buck. So, yeah, it's definitely
[02:49:44.640 --> 02:49:46.600]  kind of ask around in the community
[02:49:46.600 --> 02:49:48.680]  and just be wary,
[02:49:48.680 --> 02:49:50.200]  you know, and be mindful that, yeah,
[02:49:50.240 --> 02:49:51.840]  these people telling you you need to
[02:49:51.840 --> 02:49:53.680]  have this product or, you know, this
[02:49:53.680 --> 02:49:55.600]  is the new genetic
[02:49:56.320 --> 02:49:57.320]  piping it up.
[02:49:57.400 --> 02:49:58.720]  You know, that's how they make their
[02:49:58.720 --> 02:49:59.720]  living.
[02:49:59.800 --> 02:50:01.600]  They don't necessarily make their
[02:50:01.600 --> 02:50:03.240]  living by being 100 percent
[02:50:03.440 --> 02:50:04.440]  forthcoming.
[02:50:07.350 --> 02:50:09.150]  And also really important
[02:50:09.150 --> 02:50:11.150]  to understand, are they an indoor
[02:50:11.150 --> 02:50:12.990]  breeder or an outdoor breeder?
[02:50:13.510 --> 02:50:15.070]  Because you want to stick in your in
[02:50:15.070 --> 02:50:16.550]  your lane. And another thing, too, is
[02:50:16.550 --> 02:50:17.590]  look where they're breeding.
[02:50:18.150 --> 02:50:20.030]  They don't buy seeds from a
[02:50:20.190 --> 02:50:21.790]  company in Humboldt if you're living
[02:50:21.790 --> 02:50:22.990]  in the high fucking desert.
[02:50:23.030 --> 02:50:24.270]  It's not going to it's not going to do
[02:50:24.270 --> 02:50:26.270]  well up there or let it run
[02:50:26.270 --> 02:50:27.910]  wild for a couple of years and it'll
[02:50:27.910 --> 02:50:29.750]  be fine. So let it let it fowl.
[02:50:30.390 --> 02:50:32.510]  But those are kinds of common sense
[02:50:32.510 --> 02:50:33.790]  things that you need to take into
[02:50:33.790 --> 02:50:35.310]  consideration when you're buying a
[02:50:35.310 --> 02:50:36.310]  genetic.
[02:50:39.580 --> 02:50:41.340]  Yeah, agreed for sure.
[02:50:43.140 --> 02:50:44.500]  Peter, did you have more questions?
[02:50:49.860 --> 02:50:51.700]  Sorry, I was I was entering
[02:50:51.940 --> 02:50:53.300]  something into the calendar.
[02:50:53.380 --> 02:50:55.020]  So we're going to do a
[02:50:55.860 --> 02:50:56.860]  vermicompost.
[02:50:59.940 --> 02:51:01.540]  What's the book? Elka, help me out
[02:51:01.540 --> 02:51:02.540]  with the book name.
[02:51:02.700 --> 02:51:04.860]  Elka and our little Elka's
[02:51:05.300 --> 02:51:06.300]  book club.
[02:51:08.980 --> 02:51:10.460]  He is going to cover a book
[02:51:10.780 --> 02:51:12.700]  from a woman who passed away.
[02:51:13.300 --> 02:51:14.620]  And I'm totally blanking on the name
[02:51:14.620 --> 02:51:16.020]  of the book. But anyway,
[02:51:16.900 --> 02:51:18.780]  so someone at Val
[02:51:18.780 --> 02:51:20.180]  a while ago asked, I would like to
[02:51:20.180 --> 02:51:21.220]  know what you look for under the
[02:51:21.220 --> 02:51:22.220]  microscope.
[02:51:22.660 --> 02:51:23.660]  So.
[02:51:25.300 --> 02:51:27.140]  Leighton, you could probably as our
[02:51:27.540 --> 02:51:29.740]  as our microscope correspondent.
[02:51:30.380 --> 02:51:32.100]  Yeah. So, you know,
[02:51:32.740 --> 02:51:34.340]  I think the biggest piece,
[02:51:35.020 --> 02:51:37.060]  missing piece of microscopy
[02:51:37.820 --> 02:51:39.140]  is the fact that
[02:51:39.820 --> 02:51:42.020]  people don't look at the surroundings
[02:51:42.020 --> 02:51:43.060]  of where they're collecting the
[02:51:43.060 --> 02:51:44.020]  sample.
[02:51:44.020 --> 02:51:45.860]  So in science, 50 percent of science
[02:51:45.860 --> 02:51:46.780]  is observation.
[02:51:46.780 --> 02:51:49.180]  So by looking around
[02:51:49.460 --> 02:51:50.500]  the environment before you're
[02:51:50.500 --> 02:51:51.860]  collecting these samples, you're
[02:51:51.860 --> 02:51:53.060]  going to have a really good
[02:51:53.060 --> 02:51:54.900]  indication of what
[02:51:54.900 --> 02:51:56.220]  kind of environment am I in.
[02:51:57.300 --> 02:51:58.820]  So that is probably the biggest
[02:51:59.220 --> 02:52:00.060]  missing piece.
[02:52:00.060 --> 02:52:01.980]  And then secondly, if you
[02:52:01.980 --> 02:52:04.220]  go and start looking
[02:52:04.220 --> 02:52:05.860]  for what you want to see,
[02:52:06.700 --> 02:52:07.700]  you're going to see it.
[02:52:07.740 --> 02:52:09.300]  And if you're in a bad mood and
[02:52:09.300 --> 02:52:11.420]  you're looking to see bad
[02:52:11.420 --> 02:52:12.780]  things, then that's what you're
[02:52:12.780 --> 02:52:14.340]  going to see. So that's the another
[02:52:14.340 --> 02:52:16.540]  big piece of like clearing
[02:52:16.540 --> 02:52:18.060]  your head and getting
[02:52:18.580 --> 02:52:20.500]  getting in the right frame of mind
[02:52:20.620 --> 02:52:21.620]  and repeating.
[02:52:21.900 --> 02:52:23.980]  Let me see what I'm supposed
[02:52:23.980 --> 02:52:25.860]  to see, not what I want to see
[02:52:25.860 --> 02:52:27.460]  or not what I don't want to see.
[02:52:28.420 --> 02:52:29.900]  And then then you're looking for
[02:52:29.900 --> 02:52:31.500]  diversity. So you want to see
[02:52:32.060 --> 02:52:33.460]  a lot of fungal hyphae.
[02:52:33.460 --> 02:52:34.580]  You want to see, you know,
[02:52:34.580 --> 02:52:35.820]  nematodes.
[02:52:35.820 --> 02:52:37.740]  You want to see flagellates, amoeba,
[02:52:38.460 --> 02:52:40.060]  a variety of different types of
[02:52:40.060 --> 02:52:41.060]  bacteria.
[02:52:41.940 --> 02:52:44.180]  So the diving down the microscope
[02:52:44.180 --> 02:52:46.260]  hole is a is a big commitment.
[02:52:46.300 --> 02:52:48.220]  You can't just expect to jump on
[02:52:48.220 --> 02:52:49.220]  this
[02:52:50.140 --> 02:52:51.980]  jet fighter and fly.
[02:52:52.300 --> 02:52:53.700]  You got to do the work, man.
[02:52:54.140 --> 02:52:56.260]  So I usually do a one hour
[02:52:56.260 --> 02:52:58.220]  FaceTime with people to really get
[02:52:58.220 --> 02:52:59.260]  them established.
[02:53:00.020 --> 02:53:01.180]  I only charge one hundred fifty
[02:53:01.180 --> 02:53:02.620]  bucks and I'm there to support you
[02:53:02.620 --> 02:53:03.380]  after the fact.
[02:53:03.380 --> 02:53:04.460]  But I'm going to make you do the
[02:53:04.460 --> 02:53:05.460]  work.
[02:53:05.580 --> 02:53:07.500]  But that's that's the real
[02:53:07.500 --> 02:53:09.140]  answer right there is observation
[02:53:09.140 --> 02:53:10.100]  of where the samples being
[02:53:10.100 --> 02:53:12.060]  collected from clearing
[02:53:12.060 --> 02:53:13.820]  your mind and
[02:53:13.820 --> 02:53:15.660]  then diving down that rabbit hole,
[02:53:15.660 --> 02:53:16.860]  spending the time.
[02:53:16.900 --> 02:53:18.540]  Again, this is all about doing the
[02:53:18.540 --> 02:53:20.620]  work, not just expecting to know
[02:53:20.980 --> 02:53:22.900]  there are the experiences way
[02:53:22.900 --> 02:53:23.900]  more valuable.
[02:53:24.020 --> 02:53:25.500]  And that requires a shit ton of
[02:53:25.500 --> 02:53:26.500]  time.
[02:53:26.540 --> 02:53:27.540]  So it's a commitment.
[02:53:28.540 --> 02:53:29.540]  Hope that answered it.
[02:53:32.440 --> 02:53:33.440]  Val.
[02:53:36.290 --> 02:53:37.490]  Well, we're waiting for Val to
[02:53:37.490 --> 02:53:38.490]  respond.
[02:53:38.930 --> 02:53:40.730]  So when you went
[02:53:40.730 --> 02:53:42.490]  to get your your show and
[02:53:42.490 --> 02:53:44.410]  tell stuff
[02:53:44.930 --> 02:53:46.450]  late and touched on this.
[02:53:47.410 --> 02:53:49.410]  But what so what do you when
[02:53:50.050 --> 02:53:51.650]  this was from Red Primo, can we get
[02:53:51.650 --> 02:53:53.210]  some discussion about soil life and
[02:53:53.210 --> 02:53:54.810]  dry farming, specifically when the
[02:53:54.810 --> 02:53:56.650]  top layer of soil is dry?
[02:53:56.690 --> 02:53:58.890]  So can you talk about kind of your
[02:53:59.370 --> 02:54:01.290]  dry farming adventures and
[02:54:02.010 --> 02:54:03.970]  kind of what you saw
[02:54:03.970 --> 02:54:05.690]  and what you were concerned about or
[02:54:05.690 --> 02:54:07.250]  not concerned about or how things
[02:54:07.250 --> 02:54:08.850]  played out? Like because I'm sure
[02:54:08.850 --> 02:54:10.730]  there was plenty of dry soil on top.
[02:54:12.090 --> 02:54:13.130]  Oh, yeah, for sure.
[02:54:13.210 --> 02:54:14.690]  Like I said, there was about a foot
[02:54:15.170 --> 02:54:16.690]  of soil that was
[02:54:17.810 --> 02:54:19.210]  pretty much bone dry.
[02:54:20.370 --> 02:54:21.730]  And really, like I'm
[02:54:22.210 --> 02:54:24.450]  I'm no expert in dry farming
[02:54:24.450 --> 02:54:25.370]  by any means.
[02:54:25.370 --> 02:54:27.330]  I'm just you know, just dip
[02:54:27.330 --> 02:54:29.330]  my ball, just dove in this season
[02:54:30.610 --> 02:54:32.690]  and it went against a lot of
[02:54:32.690 --> 02:54:35.050]  what I had been learning
[02:54:35.050 --> 02:54:36.210]  and studying with the no till
[02:54:36.210 --> 02:54:37.210]  systems.
[02:54:38.450 --> 02:54:40.410]  The you know, mulching what
[02:54:40.410 --> 02:54:42.210]  people will do out there and
[02:54:42.210 --> 02:54:43.730]  they'll call it a dust mulch.
[02:54:44.050 --> 02:54:45.730]  And they basically have this
[02:54:46.130 --> 02:54:48.250]  this soil that's that's tilled
[02:54:48.530 --> 02:54:50.370]  and they have like a layer of it.
[02:54:50.370 --> 02:54:51.530]  That's just yeah, it's
[02:54:52.290 --> 02:54:53.970]  just what it sounds like, a layer of
[02:54:53.970 --> 02:54:55.810]  dust mulch. And there was no
[02:54:57.010 --> 02:54:58.850]  obviously there wasn't visible
[02:54:58.850 --> 02:55:00.730]  activity until it started
[02:55:00.730 --> 02:55:02.570]  to get a little bit more humid
[02:55:03.450 --> 02:55:04.730]  and nights where it would have more
[02:55:04.730 --> 02:55:05.570]  humidity.
[02:55:05.570 --> 02:55:07.370]  And then I started to see some
[02:55:07.370 --> 02:55:09.090]  some mush some fruiting bodies come
[02:55:09.090 --> 02:55:10.250]  up, some different kinds of
[02:55:10.250 --> 02:55:11.250]  mushrooms, which
[02:55:12.210 --> 02:55:13.410]  was a surprise to me.
[02:55:14.730 --> 02:55:15.730]  And yeah, I mean,
[02:55:16.490 --> 02:55:18.570]  I'd be interested to see what that
[02:55:18.570 --> 02:55:20.490]  looks like under a scope because
[02:55:20.770 --> 02:55:23.050]  it is it's it's really like a way
[02:55:23.050 --> 02:55:24.090]  different paradigm.
[02:55:24.090 --> 02:55:25.010]  It's you know, you're growing
[02:55:25.010 --> 02:55:26.090]  organically still.
[02:55:26.450 --> 02:55:28.290]  But yeah, you're you're tilling
[02:55:28.290 --> 02:55:29.370]  the soil. These people,
[02:55:30.330 --> 02:55:31.970]  some of the veterans who have been
[02:55:31.970 --> 02:55:34.290]  doing this for a long, long time,
[02:55:34.770 --> 02:55:36.930]  they'll do like a monthly till
[02:55:36.930 --> 02:55:38.970]  of their aisles just
[02:55:38.970 --> 02:55:40.850]  to keep the hard pan broken
[02:55:40.850 --> 02:55:42.810]  up and to keep that wicking action
[02:55:43.090 --> 02:55:45.010]  going, which is all like I said,
[02:55:45.010 --> 02:55:45.890]  it's new to me.
[02:55:45.890 --> 02:55:47.250]  I'm just kind of studying and
[02:55:47.250 --> 02:55:49.450]  observing these
[02:55:49.650 --> 02:55:51.570]  these experienced practitioners
[02:55:51.570 --> 02:55:52.850]  who've been doing this for a long
[02:55:52.850 --> 02:55:54.730]  time, do their thing
[02:55:55.010 --> 02:55:57.090]  and trying to like
[02:55:57.090 --> 02:55:58.570]  see how that fits in.
[02:55:58.810 --> 02:56:00.530]  And yeah, like I said, next year, I
[02:56:00.530 --> 02:56:02.770]  do want to have a sprayer
[02:56:03.010 --> 02:56:05.450]  and I do want to do a really fine
[02:56:05.450 --> 02:56:07.770]  mist of liquid IMO
[02:56:07.770 --> 02:56:09.530]  and Jadam microbial solution
[02:56:09.770 --> 02:56:11.530]  periodically throughout the season.
[02:56:12.810 --> 02:56:14.210]  Where I'm not really watering the
[02:56:14.210 --> 02:56:16.130]  soil, but just giving it some
[02:56:16.130 --> 02:56:17.850]  biology because there's a part of me
[02:56:17.850 --> 02:56:19.010]  that feels a little guilty,
[02:56:19.650 --> 02:56:21.650]  you know, having it having it be
[02:56:21.650 --> 02:56:23.810]  tilled and disturbing
[02:56:23.890 --> 02:56:25.050]  the soil like that.
[02:56:26.010 --> 02:56:28.330]  I want to try to to minimize
[02:56:28.530 --> 02:56:30.490]  is and do that as
[02:56:30.490 --> 02:56:32.450]  little as I possibly will
[02:56:32.450 --> 02:56:34.330]  have to do it and still be
[02:56:34.330 --> 02:56:36.250]  able to to make it work
[02:56:37.050 --> 02:56:38.890]  and preserve the soil
[02:56:39.090 --> 02:56:41.050]  integrity, you know, and preserve
[02:56:41.050 --> 02:56:42.770]  that biology that's in there is
[02:56:42.810 --> 02:56:44.210]  as much as I can
[02:56:44.890 --> 02:56:46.810]  really try to kind of marry these
[02:56:46.810 --> 02:56:48.690]  two these systems together, these
[02:56:48.690 --> 02:56:50.610]  natural farming systems along
[02:56:50.610 --> 02:56:52.330]  with the dry farming system.
[02:56:53.530 --> 02:56:55.450]  So it's it's I don't think there's
[02:56:55.450 --> 02:56:57.370]  really anybody doing that right now.
[02:56:58.210 --> 02:56:59.650]  So it's going to be kind of the
[02:56:59.650 --> 02:57:01.450]  field is going to be my laboratory
[02:57:01.730 --> 02:57:03.090]  and I'm going to get to play around
[02:57:03.090 --> 02:57:05.050]  with it. And I'm looking forward
[02:57:05.050 --> 02:57:06.930]  to trying to fuse those
[02:57:06.930 --> 02:57:08.970]  two techniques and to
[02:57:08.970 --> 02:57:10.890]  really advance kind of
[02:57:12.810 --> 02:57:14.690]  and advance both of them a little
[02:57:14.690 --> 02:57:15.690]  bit.
[02:57:18.820 --> 02:57:20.500]  Johnny, you ever thought of doing
[02:57:20.500 --> 02:57:21.780]  like a small plot
[02:57:22.460 --> 02:57:24.460]  in different ways just to see,
[02:57:24.460 --> 02:57:26.180]  you know, like over in one area
[02:57:26.180 --> 02:57:28.300]  where it's not going to affect the
[02:57:28.300 --> 02:57:29.100]  production?
[02:57:29.100 --> 02:57:30.060]  Yeah, because that would be really
[02:57:30.060 --> 02:57:30.780]  interesting to see.
[02:57:30.780 --> 02:57:32.740]  Like, I don't totally get
[02:57:32.740 --> 02:57:34.340]  why you would till your islands
[02:57:34.700 --> 02:57:36.100]  or till in between your rows.
[02:57:36.620 --> 02:57:38.420]  That to me is a foreign concept.
[02:57:38.420 --> 02:57:40.260]  I mean, I would think you'd
[02:57:40.260 --> 02:57:42.580]  want to keep the soil structure
[02:57:42.580 --> 02:57:44.420]  intact so that it worked better
[02:57:44.620 --> 02:57:46.300]  because as soon as you open up those
[02:57:46.300 --> 02:57:48.100]  air pockets, maybe maybe
[02:57:48.100 --> 02:57:49.620]  that's what it is, is letting that
[02:57:49.620 --> 02:57:51.220]  air get down deeper in
[02:57:51.820 --> 02:57:53.900]  to dry it out faster to force
[02:57:53.900 --> 02:57:55.540]  the wicking action even more.
[02:57:55.820 --> 02:57:57.180]  But it would be interesting to hear
[02:57:57.180 --> 02:57:59.060]  your observations, like if you did
[02:57:59.060 --> 02:58:01.100]  an area one way and did the other
[02:58:01.220 --> 02:58:02.260]  area a different way.
[02:58:02.740 --> 02:58:03.180]  You know what I mean?
[02:58:03.180 --> 02:58:05.340]  Yes, I totally I totally love
[02:58:05.340 --> 02:58:06.700]  doing side by sides.
[02:58:06.940 --> 02:58:08.740]  And I'm going to try to be doing a
[02:58:08.740 --> 02:58:10.420]  whole bunch this year and varying
[02:58:10.420 --> 02:58:12.500]  different different ways,
[02:58:12.500 --> 02:58:13.660]  different conditions.
[02:58:13.660 --> 02:58:15.780]  I want to be doing different seed
[02:58:15.780 --> 02:58:18.260]  treatments before I germinate
[02:58:18.260 --> 02:58:20.380]  them and see how different
[02:58:20.380 --> 02:58:21.260]  things stack up.
[02:58:22.860 --> 02:58:24.820]  And as well as that, yeah, do
[02:58:24.820 --> 02:58:27.020]  like a lesser till
[02:58:27.020 --> 02:58:29.060]  and I'll
[02:58:29.060 --> 02:58:30.580]  send you a link or I don't know,
[02:58:30.580 --> 02:58:31.900]  Peter, if you could pull up
[02:58:33.380 --> 02:58:35.740]  Happy Dream Farms or something.
[02:58:35.740 --> 02:58:38.260]  He's got a really interesting
[02:58:38.260 --> 02:58:40.180]  like he has the whole process
[02:58:40.180 --> 02:58:41.260]  kind of outlined.
[02:58:41.780 --> 02:58:44.180]  Let me see if I could find it real
[02:58:44.180 --> 02:58:44.380]  quick.
[02:58:46.300 --> 02:58:47.180]  Happy.
[02:58:47.500 --> 02:58:48.500]  Yeah, it's Mr.
[02:58:49.060 --> 02:58:50.340]  Mr. Dot D.
[02:58:51.260 --> 02:58:51.780]  Go ahead.
[02:58:52.420 --> 02:58:53.140]  Mr.
[02:58:53.900 --> 02:58:56.260]  Period D underscore
[02:58:56.660 --> 02:58:57.740]  happy dreams.
[02:59:00.260 --> 02:59:01.860]  And no,
[02:59:01.860 --> 02:59:03.100]  no, that's that's his personal
[02:59:03.100 --> 02:59:04.100]  account.
[02:59:04.220 --> 02:59:05.700]  I'll try to find it to you so you
[02:59:05.700 --> 02:59:06.980]  can post it somewhere.
[02:59:09.300 --> 02:59:11.060]  But it's really, really
[02:59:11.260 --> 02:59:13.100]  freaking crazy, like I like.
[02:59:13.260 --> 02:59:14.500]  It's foreign to me, too.
[02:59:14.500 --> 02:59:16.460]  Layton, I really
[02:59:16.460 --> 02:59:18.460]  like hadn't seen anything like
[02:59:18.460 --> 02:59:19.460]  it ever.
[02:59:20.180 --> 02:59:21.620]  I just kind of, you know.
[02:59:22.100 --> 02:59:22.900]  Oh, here it is.
[02:59:22.900 --> 02:59:23.780]  All right. So I found it.
[02:59:23.780 --> 02:59:25.500]  It's happy dreams farm.
[02:59:27.860 --> 02:59:29.340]  And if you go down
[02:59:29.660 --> 02:59:31.820]  a little ways, it'll he's
[02:59:31.820 --> 02:59:33.500]  got like room to aisles.
[02:59:36.340 --> 02:59:38.260]  Like really, really room
[02:59:38.260 --> 02:59:39.820]  aisles and yeah, this guy
[02:59:42.260 --> 02:59:44.300]  there's one from July 26
[02:59:44.300 --> 02:59:46.420]  where you could kind of see how
[02:59:46.420 --> 02:59:48.700]  like it's so soft and
[02:59:51.460 --> 02:59:52.860]  it just goes against everything
[02:59:52.860 --> 02:59:53.740]  that I've learned growing
[02:59:53.740 --> 02:59:55.700]  organically pretty much in
[02:59:55.700 --> 02:59:57.500]  growing this this thing.
[02:59:57.500 --> 02:59:58.820]  But the results work.
[02:59:58.980 --> 03:00:00.660]  It's just I'm I'm concerned about
[03:00:00.660 --> 03:00:02.860]  the micro microbiology.
[03:00:02.900 --> 03:00:04.260]  That's the video right there where
[03:00:04.260 --> 03:00:05.380]  you can kind of see
[03:00:06.780 --> 03:00:08.460]  how he's worked this soil.
[03:00:08.460 --> 03:00:09.460]  And it's.
[03:00:10.340 --> 03:00:12.100]  I've never you know, this is like
[03:00:12.460 --> 03:00:14.020]  brand new, I saw what these guys
[03:00:14.020 --> 03:00:16.060]  were doing, I'm like, what the hell
[03:00:16.060 --> 03:00:17.060]  is this?
[03:00:17.340 --> 03:00:18.500]  But it works for them.
[03:00:18.900 --> 03:00:20.140]  It works for they have great
[03:00:20.140 --> 03:00:22.420]  results and and
[03:00:22.740 --> 03:00:23.740]  it's.
[03:00:24.300 --> 03:00:26.020]  I don't know, man, like I do, I want
[03:00:26.020 --> 03:00:27.100]  to do some side by side.
[03:00:27.100 --> 03:00:28.940]  And like I said, I want to try to be
[03:00:28.940 --> 03:00:31.020]  inoculating and I want to try
[03:00:31.020 --> 03:00:33.060]  to be disturbing the soil as little
[03:00:33.060 --> 03:00:34.060]  as possible
[03:00:35.380 --> 03:00:37.020]  because I think there is a way to
[03:00:37.020 --> 03:00:37.940]  make that happen.
[03:00:37.940 --> 03:00:38.940]  And
[03:00:40.020 --> 03:00:41.460]  innovation doesn't happen without
[03:00:41.460 --> 03:00:43.140]  trying new things either.
[03:00:43.140 --> 03:00:44.860]  So I'm going to I'm going to give it
[03:00:44.860 --> 03:00:46.500]  a go and just experiment a little
[03:00:46.660 --> 03:00:47.660]  bit next season.
[03:00:48.100 --> 03:00:50.060]  So he doesn't use any amendments
[03:00:50.060 --> 03:00:51.060]  at all.
[03:00:52.220 --> 03:00:54.100]  I don't know if this is him who does.
[03:00:54.140 --> 03:00:55.300]  I think maybe.
[03:00:55.300 --> 03:00:57.180]  Yeah, I think this guy and
[03:00:57.820 --> 03:00:59.580]  Sunshine Johnston, who
[03:00:59.700 --> 03:01:00.700]  is on.
[03:01:02.220 --> 03:01:03.220]  Where is it?
[03:01:04.660 --> 03:01:06.540]  Her thing is dry
[03:01:06.540 --> 03:01:08.380]  farmed organic medicinals.
[03:01:08.780 --> 03:01:10.820]  And yeah, this lady, she
[03:01:11.460 --> 03:01:13.340]  she says she doesn't use any any
[03:01:13.340 --> 03:01:14.340]  amendments.
[03:01:16.180 --> 03:01:17.260]  And they just they put.
[03:01:17.500 --> 03:01:19.380]  Yeah, I know it's
[03:01:19.380 --> 03:01:20.380]  wild to me.
[03:01:20.980 --> 03:01:23.100]  I know
[03:01:23.860 --> 03:01:24.780]  because you don't see any
[03:01:24.780 --> 03:01:25.940]  deficiencies.
[03:01:25.940 --> 03:01:27.300]  And I mean, obviously, that's a
[03:01:27.300 --> 03:01:28.980]  pretty large sample size.
[03:01:29.540 --> 03:01:31.540]  Yeah. And no and no
[03:01:32.180 --> 03:01:33.860]  dough cover crops.
[03:01:33.860 --> 03:01:35.900]  No. You know, you know how much that
[03:01:35.900 --> 03:01:37.820]  soil would heat up during the day up
[03:01:37.820 --> 03:01:39.300]  there, especially in the middle of
[03:01:39.300 --> 03:01:40.300]  summer.
[03:01:40.500 --> 03:01:41.460]  It's hot.
[03:01:41.460 --> 03:01:43.420]  Yeah. Maybe that's maybe that's what
[03:01:43.420 --> 03:01:44.900]  it's all about is like
[03:01:45.580 --> 03:01:47.420]  just forcing this plant to do the
[03:01:47.420 --> 03:01:49.340]  work deeper down under
[03:01:49.340 --> 03:01:51.260]  the soil by cooking the surface.
[03:01:52.420 --> 03:01:53.860]  Yeah, and it really pulls that
[03:01:53.860 --> 03:01:55.780]  moisture right up to, you know, like
[03:01:55.780 --> 03:01:57.260]  we were saying earlier, this kind of
[03:01:57.260 --> 03:01:59.140]  that ebb and flow and it's
[03:01:59.140 --> 03:02:01.340]  so hot and dry on the surface.
[03:02:01.620 --> 03:02:02.620]  Yeah. Look at that.
[03:02:02.820 --> 03:02:04.660]  They plant those they plant those
[03:02:04.660 --> 03:02:06.020]  suckers right in there.
[03:02:06.260 --> 03:02:07.580]  Small as can be
[03:02:08.180 --> 03:02:10.060]  and don't even water them in.
[03:02:12.100 --> 03:02:13.100]  That's crazy.
[03:02:13.220 --> 03:02:15.220]  For me, that's just like I
[03:02:15.220 --> 03:02:17.020]  get kind of goosebumps thinking
[03:02:17.020 --> 03:02:18.180]  about it. I'm like, oh, God.
[03:02:19.260 --> 03:02:21.060]  All of those have deficiencies.
[03:02:21.420 --> 03:02:23.300]  Yeah. It's because it kind of takes
[03:02:23.300 --> 03:02:24.180]  hold.
[03:02:24.180 --> 03:02:25.180]  That's what they take.
[03:02:25.380 --> 03:02:27.140]  They take a minute to really get in
[03:02:27.140 --> 03:02:29.220]  there and they struggle.
[03:02:29.340 --> 03:02:31.300]  They fucking struggle for
[03:02:31.300 --> 03:02:33.220]  the first like week or two and
[03:02:33.220 --> 03:02:34.780]  then they tap in and they green
[03:02:34.820 --> 03:02:36.220]  right. Look how small those little
[03:02:36.220 --> 03:02:37.220]  pots are to
[03:02:38.060 --> 03:02:39.060]  that's insane.
[03:02:39.060 --> 03:02:40.060]  Yeah.
[03:02:41.580 --> 03:02:43.500]  And how long have they
[03:02:43.500 --> 03:02:44.500]  been doing this?
[03:02:44.500 --> 03:02:45.780]  Yeah, that's what I was about that
[03:02:45.780 --> 03:02:46.780]  a long time, a long
[03:02:47.820 --> 03:02:49.380]  time. And people who had been
[03:02:49.940 --> 03:02:51.220]  before they were
[03:02:51.860 --> 03:02:53.420]  not even just growing cannabis, but
[03:02:53.420 --> 03:02:55.740]  growing growing produce
[03:02:56.380 --> 03:02:57.420]  in the same way.
[03:02:57.420 --> 03:03:00.060]  So they're kind of sunshine,
[03:03:00.100 --> 03:03:02.340]  the dry farmed organic
[03:03:02.340 --> 03:03:03.340]  medicinals.
[03:03:03.860 --> 03:03:06.140]  You know, she she's a humble
[03:03:06.140 --> 03:03:07.860]  native and she.
[03:03:09.660 --> 03:03:11.660]  You know, so she knows
[03:03:11.660 --> 03:03:13.540]  all these old school farmers who
[03:03:13.540 --> 03:03:15.180]  are grown in the Eel River Valley
[03:03:15.180 --> 03:03:16.180]  for.
[03:03:16.980 --> 03:03:18.260]  Pretty much since the flood
[03:03:18.260 --> 03:03:20.140]  happened, even before that, and
[03:03:20.740 --> 03:03:22.660]  yes, so I just you know, I really
[03:03:22.660 --> 03:03:24.500]  I think who better to kind
[03:03:24.500 --> 03:03:26.300]  of watch and observe and pick
[03:03:26.660 --> 03:03:28.860]  and kind of imitate
[03:03:29.420 --> 03:03:31.380]  than someone who's been watching
[03:03:31.380 --> 03:03:33.460]  this land for 30
[03:03:33.460 --> 03:03:34.820]  years or whatever.
[03:03:34.820 --> 03:03:35.940]  Like I'm only 31.
[03:03:35.940 --> 03:03:37.860]  So she's probably been watching
[03:03:37.860 --> 03:03:39.420]  and working this land
[03:03:39.860 --> 03:03:41.420]  since I was born.
[03:03:42.740 --> 03:03:43.980]  You know, you should you should
[03:03:43.980 --> 03:03:45.820]  reach out to her and just say,
[03:03:45.820 --> 03:03:47.780]  hey, you know, can can we just chop
[03:03:47.780 --> 03:03:48.780]  it up and like find
[03:03:49.700 --> 03:03:51.820]  out some of these other techniques
[03:03:51.820 --> 03:03:54.100]  or like maybe she's got reasons
[03:03:54.100 --> 03:03:55.740]  why she's doing certain things
[03:03:56.060 --> 03:03:57.740]  and maybe she doesn't know why she
[03:03:57.740 --> 03:03:59.620]  just knows that it works or maybe
[03:03:59.620 --> 03:04:01.340]  it's strain or cultivar related.
[03:04:01.660 --> 03:04:02.820]  Maybe these are just older
[03:04:02.820 --> 03:04:04.780]  genetics that she's been working
[03:04:06.260 --> 03:04:07.300]  that don't have issues.
[03:04:07.300 --> 03:04:08.820]  I mean, there's there's got to be
[03:04:08.820 --> 03:04:10.020]  something more to it, dude.
[03:04:11.140 --> 03:04:13.140]  So, yeah, no, I know.
[03:04:13.140 --> 03:04:15.020]  I know. I'm totally trying to.
[03:04:15.540 --> 03:04:17.060]  I have a buddy who's
[03:04:17.380 --> 03:04:19.220]  who knows her pretty
[03:04:19.220 --> 03:04:20.980]  well. And I'm like, link
[03:04:20.980 --> 03:04:22.820]  me up like I have
[03:04:22.820 --> 03:04:24.340]  a lot of questions to ask.
[03:04:24.340 --> 03:04:25.940]  And like I'm a fan, you know, look
[03:04:25.940 --> 03:04:27.900]  at this. Look at she's digging
[03:04:27.900 --> 03:04:29.260]  the soil with her hand up.
[03:04:29.300 --> 03:04:30.300]  There's some moisture.
[03:04:30.580 --> 03:04:31.900]  Yeah, there it is.
[03:04:31.900 --> 03:04:32.860]  Falls right up.
[03:04:32.860 --> 03:04:34.620]  And so I think
[03:04:34.620 --> 03:04:36.020]  this is a video where she just plops
[03:04:36.580 --> 03:04:38.860]  four inch pot plant right in there.
[03:04:39.460 --> 03:04:40.660]  Oh, no, not in that one.
[03:04:40.660 --> 03:04:42.700]  But yeah, it was I
[03:04:42.700 --> 03:04:44.940]  saw that. I was like my jaw dropped.
[03:04:44.980 --> 03:04:46.740]  It's like, oh, my God.
[03:04:49.600 --> 03:04:51.520]  Well, literally, when you're saying
[03:04:51.520 --> 03:04:53.120]  and they drop it and then move on to
[03:04:53.120 --> 03:04:54.360]  the next plant, they're not even
[03:04:54.360 --> 03:04:55.680]  watering it in or anything.
[03:04:55.680 --> 03:04:56.680]  That's another like
[03:04:57.640 --> 03:04:59.560]  because it it seems
[03:04:59.560 --> 03:05:01.160]  like some of the more
[03:05:01.320 --> 03:05:03.520]  in my maybe naive
[03:05:03.520 --> 03:05:04.680]  view, it would seem like more of
[03:05:04.680 --> 03:05:06.560]  those plants would fail than then
[03:05:06.560 --> 03:05:07.920]  would succeed with that thought
[03:05:07.920 --> 03:05:08.920]  process.
[03:05:09.960 --> 03:05:12.120]  Yeah, I mean, like I said, it's
[03:05:12.120 --> 03:05:14.040]  something that I even next year,
[03:05:14.040 --> 03:05:15.480]  like I might try it with like a
[03:05:15.480 --> 03:05:17.160]  plan or two, but
[03:05:17.440 --> 03:05:18.720]  I'm not about to plant the whole
[03:05:18.720 --> 03:05:20.600]  acre and just it's just toss it in
[03:05:20.600 --> 03:05:22.160]  there. And but I mean,
[03:05:22.840 --> 03:05:24.480]  there is it's a scary couple of
[03:05:24.480 --> 03:05:26.120]  weeks where they're tapping in.
[03:05:27.360 --> 03:05:28.720]  They're tapping in and it just
[03:05:28.720 --> 03:05:30.720]  really once they get established,
[03:05:30.720 --> 03:05:31.720]  though, they
[03:05:32.560 --> 03:05:34.320]  they take off, they take off.
[03:05:34.320 --> 03:05:35.880]  And like I said, these were the
[03:05:35.880 --> 03:05:37.400]  plants. As soon as I shut the water
[03:05:37.400 --> 03:05:39.280]  off at the spot that I was working,
[03:05:39.760 --> 03:05:41.600]  they just they look incredible.
[03:05:42.840 --> 03:05:45.040]  They look absolutely incredible, way
[03:05:45.040 --> 03:05:46.200]  happier without getting the
[03:05:46.200 --> 03:05:47.200]  irrigation.
[03:05:47.520 --> 03:05:49.440]  So, yeah, I definitely I'm trying
[03:05:49.440 --> 03:05:51.360]  to reach out to all these
[03:05:51.360 --> 03:05:53.280]  people in the area and and
[03:05:53.280 --> 03:05:54.280]  just, you
[03:05:55.120 --> 03:05:56.120]  know, like be
[03:05:57.160 --> 03:05:59.120]  a humble student and really
[03:05:59.280 --> 03:06:01.080]  kind of, you know, take what
[03:06:01.080 --> 03:06:02.600]  information they have to give me.
[03:06:04.040 --> 03:06:05.080]  Because, yeah, I mean, look, I mean,
[03:06:05.080 --> 03:06:06.680]  they're not doing trellising.
[03:06:07.120 --> 03:06:09.000]  It's it's a really interesting
[03:06:09.000 --> 03:06:10.880]  style of growing, which I've only
[03:06:10.880 --> 03:06:12.720]  seen like three or four farms in
[03:06:12.720 --> 03:06:14.000]  that particular region
[03:06:14.840 --> 03:06:15.840]  doing.
[03:06:16.920 --> 03:06:18.760]  Now, are there other
[03:06:18.760 --> 03:06:20.640]  farms that might not have that same
[03:06:20.640 --> 03:06:22.360]  soil system that you know that are
[03:06:22.360 --> 03:06:24.120]  thriving like this as well using
[03:06:24.120 --> 03:06:25.120]  this system?
[03:06:25.760 --> 03:06:28.240]  Or this might be a humble.
[03:06:28.880 --> 03:06:31.400]  I think this is just that special,
[03:06:31.840 --> 03:06:33.280]  you know, like I said earlier, that
[03:06:33.280 --> 03:06:35.480]  kind of series of unfortunate
[03:06:35.480 --> 03:06:37.200]  events and that massive flooding
[03:06:37.200 --> 03:06:38.840]  that happened were, you know, it was
[03:06:38.840 --> 03:06:40.840]  so bad that people were
[03:06:40.840 --> 03:06:42.440]  boating in the redwoods.
[03:06:43.400 --> 03:06:44.800]  They were they were literally like
[03:06:44.960 --> 03:06:46.760]  like going around on boats in the
[03:06:46.760 --> 03:06:48.600]  redwoods because the river had
[03:06:48.600 --> 03:06:50.240]  gone up like, you know, up to the
[03:06:50.240 --> 03:06:52.160]  one oh one, which it's
[03:06:52.440 --> 03:06:54.440]  a pretty significant amount
[03:06:54.440 --> 03:06:55.440]  of distance.
[03:06:55.800 --> 03:06:56.800]  So, yeah,
[03:06:57.800 --> 03:06:59.640]  without that happening, I don't know
[03:06:59.640 --> 03:07:01.680]  if this would be achievable.
[03:07:01.720 --> 03:07:02.960]  What is going on here?
[03:07:06.140 --> 03:07:07.540]  I'm pretty sure there were some
[03:07:07.540 --> 03:07:09.820]  lands prior
[03:07:10.380 --> 03:07:11.660]  that were similar to this.
[03:07:11.700 --> 03:07:13.660]  I just think that the distribution
[03:07:13.660 --> 03:07:14.500]  changed.
[03:07:14.500 --> 03:07:16.540]  So as the river came around a corner,
[03:07:16.820 --> 03:07:18.780]  it took away from one flood plain
[03:07:18.780 --> 03:07:20.420]  and dumped it onto another, a
[03:07:20.420 --> 03:07:21.420]  different flood plain.
[03:07:21.940 --> 03:07:23.780]  So my gut feeling is it's been
[03:07:23.780 --> 03:07:25.620]  being done for a long time just
[03:07:25.620 --> 03:07:27.500]  in different areas along the river.
[03:07:28.780 --> 03:07:29.780]  Yeah, I can totally see that.
[03:07:29.780 --> 03:07:30.780]  It's really cool, man.
[03:07:31.820 --> 03:07:32.820]  Neat stuff. I'm happy to hear.
[03:07:32.820 --> 03:07:33.820]  You know, if you find out.
[03:07:35.660 --> 03:07:36.940]  I was going to say, if you find out
[03:07:36.940 --> 03:07:38.700]  more about it, I was going to say,
[03:07:38.700 --> 03:07:40.300]  if you find out more about this, hit
[03:07:40.300 --> 03:07:42.060]  me up because this is like, you
[03:07:42.060 --> 03:07:43.780]  know, as a soil engineer, it's
[03:07:43.780 --> 03:07:45.020]  really just interesting.
[03:07:45.180 --> 03:07:46.820]  I'd love to get a texture test.
[03:07:47.220 --> 03:07:49.020]  So a soil sample that I can send out
[03:07:49.020 --> 03:07:51.020]  to see what is the sand, so clay
[03:07:51.020 --> 03:07:52.660]  and organic matter relationship
[03:07:53.300 --> 03:07:54.900]  that would probably open up some
[03:07:56.020 --> 03:07:57.620]  my eyes to what what the fuck is
[03:07:57.620 --> 03:07:58.620]  going on.
[03:07:58.700 --> 03:08:00.620]  But it's it's really cool.
[03:08:00.740 --> 03:08:03.180]  This this process and I'm amazed.
[03:08:04.420 --> 03:08:06.100]  Me too. Still to this day.
[03:08:06.580 --> 03:08:08.140]  And I'm really happy to be able to
[03:08:08.140 --> 03:08:10.460]  share it with you and everybody
[03:08:10.460 --> 03:08:12.420]  because it's it's mind blowing to
[03:08:12.420 --> 03:08:13.420]  me.
[03:08:13.860 --> 03:08:15.820]  It's still like I think about
[03:08:15.820 --> 03:08:17.140]  it and I tell people and they're
[03:08:17.140 --> 03:08:18.940]  like, what? And yeah, even other
[03:08:18.980 --> 03:08:20.380]  growers who have been here for a
[03:08:20.380 --> 03:08:22.380]  long time, when you tell them that,
[03:08:22.380 --> 03:08:24.220]  they're like, no way.
[03:08:24.260 --> 03:08:25.340]  Like, you're crazy.
[03:08:25.500 --> 03:08:27.060]  But yeah, I mean, it's just it's
[03:08:27.060 --> 03:08:28.060]  super interesting.
[03:08:28.100 --> 03:08:29.100]  I totally will.
[03:08:29.700 --> 03:08:30.820]  I'm going to be trying to pick
[03:08:30.820 --> 03:08:32.260]  these people's brains as much as
[03:08:32.260 --> 03:08:34.060]  possible because I'm just genuinely
[03:08:34.060 --> 03:08:36.220]  interested and they have amazing
[03:08:36.220 --> 03:08:37.220]  results.
[03:08:39.140 --> 03:08:41.260]  And, you know, it's just a unique.
[03:08:41.300 --> 03:08:43.300]  How many cannabis gardens do you see
[03:08:43.300 --> 03:08:44.300]  that
[03:08:45.380 --> 03:08:46.940]  that don't have trellis that have
[03:08:46.940 --> 03:08:48.820]  that kind of that look to them?
[03:08:49.060 --> 03:08:50.420]  It looks like they're in frickin
[03:08:50.420 --> 03:08:51.980]  Pakistan or Afghanistan or
[03:08:51.980 --> 03:08:53.500]  something, which is that soil
[03:08:53.500 --> 03:08:54.500]  consistency.
[03:08:54.580 --> 03:08:56.820]  And it's see there's after the rain.
[03:08:57.220 --> 03:08:58.820]  They finally got some water in that
[03:08:58.820 --> 03:08:59.820]  picture.
[03:09:00.940 --> 03:09:01.940]  But it doesn't rain.
[03:09:01.980 --> 03:09:03.660]  You know, you know how Humboldt is.
[03:09:03.660 --> 03:09:05.380]  It's frickin dry from
[03:09:06.940 --> 03:09:09.420]  May until October
[03:09:09.420 --> 03:09:11.540]  or May until, you know, September.
[03:09:12.540 --> 03:09:14.300]  So the whole majority of these
[03:09:14.300 --> 03:09:15.380]  plants life, they're getting
[03:09:15.380 --> 03:09:16.380]  nothing.
[03:09:17.540 --> 03:09:18.820]  But you notice when it rained, the
[03:09:18.820 --> 03:09:22.000]  cover crop started to come up at
[03:09:22.000 --> 03:09:24.040]  least the mother mother plant
[03:09:24.040 --> 03:09:25.480]  cover crop started to come up.
[03:09:26.400 --> 03:09:28.320]  No, no, it happens fast.
[03:09:28.800 --> 03:09:30.320]  But we're you know, the grass will
[03:09:30.320 --> 03:09:31.800]  start growing, the cover crop that
[03:09:31.800 --> 03:09:33.800]  was there, the fungus starts popping
[03:09:33.800 --> 03:09:34.800]  up really quick
[03:09:35.840 --> 03:09:37.480]  after the first even doesn't even
[03:09:37.480 --> 03:09:39.000]  have to fully rain just like
[03:09:39.400 --> 03:09:40.560]  mist or drizzle.
[03:09:40.600 --> 03:09:42.360]  Once the dew starts forming,
[03:09:43.480 --> 03:09:44.720]  you know, you start to see some
[03:09:44.720 --> 03:09:45.720]  action going on.
[03:09:46.360 --> 03:09:47.840]  You know, you'd be amazed at how
[03:09:47.840 --> 03:09:49.280]  resilient Mother Nature is.
[03:09:49.600 --> 03:09:51.520]  I did a lot of work down in Arizona
[03:09:51.520 --> 03:09:53.160]  and I was traveling to Arizona and
[03:09:53.160 --> 03:09:54.560]  I was traveling between
[03:09:55.320 --> 03:09:57.320]  Tempe and Tucson
[03:09:58.120 --> 03:09:59.720]  and I'd be going back and forth
[03:10:00.520 --> 03:10:02.280]  and like the monsoons would come
[03:10:02.280 --> 03:10:04.160]  in. So it was bone dry,
[03:10:04.160 --> 03:10:05.160]  nothing living.
[03:10:05.320 --> 03:10:06.640]  Rain happened that night.
[03:10:06.720 --> 03:10:08.600]  Next day, drive back, you know, one
[03:10:08.600 --> 03:10:09.720]  way or the other and there'd be
[03:10:09.720 --> 03:10:11.040]  fuck. Everything would be green,
[03:10:11.440 --> 03:10:13.480]  like, you know, within hours of
[03:10:13.480 --> 03:10:14.240]  the rainfall.
[03:10:14.240 --> 03:10:15.240]  So I totally get it.
[03:10:15.640 --> 03:10:17.000]  You know, she's Mother Nature's
[03:10:17.000 --> 03:10:18.000]  resilient as hell.
[03:10:20.120 --> 03:10:21.280]  But this is really cool, dude.
[03:10:21.280 --> 03:10:23.000]  And, you know, I'm like, you know,
[03:10:23.200 --> 03:10:24.640]  really dig in this session today.
[03:10:24.640 --> 03:10:26.640]  I mean, you're obviously growing
[03:10:26.640 --> 03:10:28.440]  some amazing fucking plants.
[03:10:29.040 --> 03:10:31.200]  You're doing it in a methodology
[03:10:31.200 --> 03:10:32.920]  that's very unique
[03:10:33.560 --> 03:10:34.680]  and cool.
[03:10:35.080 --> 03:10:37.080]  And it's the understanding of how
[03:10:37.080 --> 03:10:39.160]  like that top, what, four or five
[03:10:39.160 --> 03:10:40.560]  inches is just duff.
[03:10:40.960 --> 03:10:42.680]  And yet you have this incredible
[03:10:42.680 --> 03:10:43.680]  growth is really
[03:10:44.640 --> 03:10:46.320]  mind boggling because most people
[03:10:46.320 --> 03:10:47.760]  will tell you that the magic really
[03:10:47.760 --> 03:10:49.240]  happens in the top six inch.
[03:10:49.480 --> 03:10:51.440]  And here you are saying, no, no, no.
[03:10:51.440 --> 03:10:53.240]  It's the fucking six inches below
[03:10:53.240 --> 03:10:54.280]  the top six inches.
[03:10:56.280 --> 03:10:58.400]  Yeah, it goes like I've said,
[03:10:58.400 --> 03:11:00.400]  it's so counterintuitive
[03:11:00.400 --> 03:11:02.440]  and goes against a lot of, you know,
[03:11:03.120 --> 03:11:04.800]  everything where I was like, holy
[03:11:04.800 --> 03:11:06.160]  shit, these guys are doing what?
[03:11:06.160 --> 03:11:08.480]  And they just seem so outlandish.
[03:11:08.520 --> 03:11:10.400]  And, yeah, there's a
[03:11:10.400 --> 03:11:11.440]  there's a lot to learn.
[03:11:11.440 --> 03:11:12.960]  And it's always nice to
[03:11:13.520 --> 03:11:14.800]  like, you know, it's humbling.
[03:11:15.040 --> 03:11:16.800]  It's humbling to see this kind of
[03:11:16.800 --> 03:11:19.040]  thing working in and
[03:11:19.200 --> 03:11:21.000]  going against a lot of the grain
[03:11:21.600 --> 03:11:23.080]  being like, OK, there's.
[03:11:24.040 --> 03:11:25.800]  There is another there's another way
[03:11:25.800 --> 03:11:27.960]  to to go about doing things.
[03:11:28.360 --> 03:11:30.080]  And actually, my my wife's
[03:11:30.840 --> 03:11:32.880]  friend's husband, he'd been kind of
[03:11:33.160 --> 03:11:34.360]  he'd worked the land a couple of
[03:11:34.360 --> 03:11:36.480]  years and he came and took a look
[03:11:36.480 --> 03:11:37.920]  and was like, shut the water, like
[03:11:37.920 --> 03:11:39.680]  shut the water off like you're good.
[03:11:39.720 --> 03:11:41.160]  Like and he kind of told me about
[03:11:41.160 --> 03:11:42.680]  the about the process.
[03:11:42.680 --> 03:11:44.520]  And he's like, you know,
[03:11:44.520 --> 03:11:46.240]  just come into it with an open mind.
[03:11:46.400 --> 03:11:48.400]  And he's like, don't get necessarily
[03:11:48.400 --> 03:11:50.520]  too attached to this ideology
[03:11:50.520 --> 03:11:51.680]  or this ideology.
[03:11:51.680 --> 03:11:53.600]  He's like, you pick and choose
[03:11:53.760 --> 03:11:56.280]  and really kind of draw
[03:11:56.280 --> 03:11:58.400]  from different systems to make it
[03:11:58.400 --> 03:12:00.600]  work and to to really optimize,
[03:12:00.600 --> 03:12:02.600]  you know, that that particular space.
[03:12:02.600 --> 03:12:05.200]  So, yeah, it was such a treat,
[03:12:05.240 --> 03:12:07.080]  you know, such a treat this season.
[03:12:07.560 --> 03:12:08.720]  It was very unexpected.
[03:12:08.720 --> 03:12:10.320]  You know, I got onto the field like
[03:12:10.600 --> 03:12:13.480]  May 1st and just popping seeds.
[03:12:13.480 --> 03:12:14.720]  And I just I got there.
[03:12:14.720 --> 03:12:15.920]  Couldn't even imagine what it was
[03:12:15.920 --> 03:12:17.080]  going to look like, how it was going
[03:12:17.080 --> 03:12:20.000]  to be. And, yeah, it was fun.
[03:12:20.360 --> 03:12:21.720]  Definitely a fun season,
[03:12:21.720 --> 03:12:22.520]  which is always great.
[03:12:22.520 --> 03:12:23.400]  And it's always fun.
[03:12:23.400 --> 03:12:26.520]  But this one was definitely extra fun.
[03:12:30.180 --> 03:12:32.380]  And now you get to enjoy the fairground,
[03:12:33.140 --> 03:12:35.380]  which I called Emerald Cup accidentally.
[03:12:37.060 --> 03:12:38.260]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:12:38.260 --> 03:12:40.460]  I'm I'm the fair.
[03:12:40.460 --> 03:12:41.260]  You're talking about, oh,
[03:12:41.260 --> 03:12:42.460]  I'm not going to the fairground.
[03:12:42.780 --> 03:12:44.060]  I'm not going to go to the
[03:12:44.060 --> 03:12:45.500]  California State Fair
[03:12:46.140 --> 03:12:46.860]  because they are doing
[03:12:46.860 --> 03:12:47.820]  a testing thing there.
[03:12:47.820 --> 03:12:50.500]  I'm I'm just going to do the Emerald Cup
[03:12:50.500 --> 03:12:54.180]  and and just relax,
[03:12:54.380 --> 03:12:56.340]  you know, spend the time like just
[03:12:57.180 --> 03:12:59.860]  just relaxing, taking notes,
[03:12:59.860 --> 03:13:01.300]  just looking at my notes,
[03:13:01.300 --> 03:13:02.700]  planning for next year.
[03:13:02.700 --> 03:13:05.340]  But it's really having downtime
[03:13:05.340 --> 03:13:06.420]  like, you know, kind of
[03:13:06.420 --> 03:13:07.740]  the soil is going to have now.
[03:13:07.740 --> 03:13:09.060]  It's going to have some downtime
[03:13:09.060 --> 03:13:11.420]  to do its thing, to to bounce back.
[03:13:11.420 --> 03:13:13.260]  And really, I'm going to reach out
[03:13:13.260 --> 03:13:14.300]  to the other farmers
[03:13:14.300 --> 03:13:15.820]  in the Eel River Valley and
[03:13:16.180 --> 03:13:18.340]  and and just see if they'll
[03:13:18.340 --> 03:13:19.620]  entertain my questions,
[03:13:19.620 --> 03:13:21.020]  which I hope that there
[03:13:21.020 --> 03:13:23.300]  they'll be they'll be willing to do that.
[03:13:24.500 --> 03:13:26.260]  And I tend to think the
[03:13:26.700 --> 03:13:28.820]  the crew as a whole are pretty open,
[03:13:28.860 --> 03:13:30.980]  you know, a lot, a lot more so nowadays.
[03:13:30.980 --> 03:13:32.660]  And, you know, understanding
[03:13:32.660 --> 03:13:34.180]  that you guys are all in the same boat,
[03:13:34.180 --> 03:13:35.820]  you might as well share notes.
[03:13:36.260 --> 03:13:37.140]  Where in the old days,
[03:13:37.140 --> 03:13:38.220]  it was all about, you know,
[03:13:38.220 --> 03:13:39.580]  no way I'm telling you nothing.
[03:13:44.140 --> 03:13:44.420]  All right.
[03:13:44.420 --> 03:13:45.860]  Are there any more questions, Peter,
[03:13:45.860 --> 03:13:47.380]  or should we wind this thing down?
[03:13:47.580 --> 03:13:50.340]  We gone three hours and 13, it looks like.
[03:13:53.660 --> 03:13:54.900]  We can wind it down.
[03:13:54.940 --> 03:13:56.100]  I got some shit to do.
[03:14:00.780 --> 03:14:02.660]  Yeah, and sorry, I'm in the chat.
[03:14:02.660 --> 03:14:04.020]  Yeah, no, I'd love to.
[03:14:04.020 --> 03:14:05.700]  I mean, on this show and other shows,
[03:14:05.700 --> 03:14:07.860]  I'd love to have and feature more women.
[03:14:08.900 --> 03:14:10.460]  Sunshine's been on.
[03:14:10.460 --> 03:14:13.180]  I know I'd love to bring on
[03:14:13.180 --> 03:14:14.540]  like a Tina Gordon
[03:14:14.860 --> 03:14:16.580]  and a whole there's a whole crew up
[03:14:16.580 --> 03:14:18.980]  and humbled now that or NorCal,
[03:14:18.980 --> 03:14:21.140]  I think now that the season's over
[03:14:22.260 --> 03:14:23.740]  have a lot more time.
[03:14:24.220 --> 03:14:25.580]  Yeah, I could reach out to
[03:14:25.580 --> 03:14:28.220]  I could reach out to season and Wendy.
[03:14:28.220 --> 03:14:29.540]  Both of those are female
[03:14:29.540 --> 03:14:30.660]  growers right there.
[03:14:30.980 --> 03:14:31.500]  So.
[03:14:35.020 --> 03:14:36.500]  Yeah, get Wendy on here.
[03:14:36.500 --> 03:14:39.780]  Wendy is a Wendy is a super
[03:14:39.780 --> 03:14:42.300]  knowledgeable, awesome person in the industry.
[03:14:42.340 --> 03:14:43.740]  Just for the viewers at home,
[03:14:43.740 --> 03:14:45.060]  we have her on the show.
[03:14:45.060 --> 03:14:46.700]  We've had Wendy on the show
[03:14:46.700 --> 03:14:50.180]  at the beginning of this in 2020, I believe.
[03:14:50.180 --> 03:14:51.740]  Actually, yeah, when I was up there
[03:14:51.740 --> 03:14:53.940]  visiting some blazing Internet.
[03:14:55.460 --> 03:14:56.620]  If I remember correctly,
[03:14:56.620 --> 03:14:59.660]  visiting her in the early days for sure.
[03:15:02.660 --> 03:15:04.100]  But gold bars for sure.
[03:15:04.100 --> 03:15:05.300]  You guys are sitting there,
[03:15:05.300 --> 03:15:06.700]  especially because of the
[03:15:06.700 --> 03:15:07.460]  the pandemic,
[03:15:07.460 --> 03:15:08.700]  but you guys are sitting there
[03:15:08.700 --> 03:15:09.660]  and you're sitting there
[03:15:09.660 --> 03:15:10.540]  and you're sitting there
[03:15:10.540 --> 03:15:11.620]  and you guys are sitting there,
[03:15:11.940 --> 03:15:12.740]  especially because you guys
[03:15:12.740 --> 03:15:15.220]  were both in the same environment.
[03:15:15.260 --> 03:15:18.060]  I felt like that was a good back and forth.
[03:15:24.220 --> 03:15:26.580]  Yes, Val, I do not want it to be a boys
[03:15:26.580 --> 03:15:28.540]  club nor a sausage party,
[03:15:29.540 --> 03:15:30.820]  and I apologize.
[03:15:30.820 --> 03:15:33.060]  I think I asked if you had emailed me.
[03:15:36.620 --> 03:15:38.540]  But feel free to email me
[03:15:38.540 --> 03:15:40.740]  as other people will attest.
[03:15:41.620 --> 03:15:42.860]  It's the squeaky wheel
[03:15:42.860 --> 03:15:44.140]  that keeps my attention,
[03:15:44.140 --> 03:15:45.700]  because like even Cheddar Bob
[03:15:45.700 --> 03:15:47.140]  just mentioned a documentary
[03:15:47.140 --> 03:15:47.900]  and like in my head,
[03:15:47.900 --> 03:15:49.380]  I was like, which documentary was that?
[03:15:49.380 --> 03:15:50.420]  And I was like, oh, yeah, that was
[03:15:50.860 --> 03:15:51.900]  I remember which one.
[03:15:51.900 --> 03:15:52.540]  And then I'm like,
[03:15:52.540 --> 03:15:53.980]  I don't even know where to find it.
[03:15:54.100 --> 03:15:55.500]  So Cheddar Bob, also,
[03:15:55.540 --> 03:15:56.540]  if you could email,
[03:15:56.540 --> 03:15:59.460]  if you could email me or text me
[03:15:59.460 --> 03:16:01.340]  a link to that documentary
[03:16:02.660 --> 03:16:03.860]  kind genetics,
[03:16:04.500 --> 03:16:09.180]  I, I, I got to build up the fortitude
[03:16:09.180 --> 03:16:11.860]  to start packing seed pack.
[03:16:11.900 --> 03:16:13.780]  I've been traumatized by sun grown
[03:16:13.780 --> 03:16:16.500]  mids seed pack in.
[03:16:19.500 --> 03:16:22.380]  I dream of putting seeds
[03:16:22.380 --> 03:16:24.020]  and vials all day long.
[03:16:27.260 --> 03:16:27.700]  Dr.
[03:16:27.700 --> 03:16:30.820]  Christine Jones, that's a good one.
[03:16:31.260 --> 03:16:35.260]  OK, if and if someone could synth it or.
[03:16:37.340 --> 03:16:38.980]  We need like a secretary
[03:16:38.980 --> 03:16:40.260]  or like someone who's like
[03:16:40.260 --> 03:16:42.620]  diligently writing shit down.
[03:16:45.660 --> 03:16:46.940]  So hold on, we have
[03:16:48.300 --> 03:16:48.740]  Dr.
[03:16:48.740 --> 03:16:50.340]  Christine Jones.
[03:16:57.920 --> 03:16:59.560]  Oh, yeah. OK, carbon.
[03:17:03.400 --> 03:17:03.880]  You guys,
[03:17:04.400 --> 03:17:05.920]  it's funny, I think I've asked
[03:17:05.920 --> 03:17:07.480]  season a couple of times to go,
[03:17:07.480 --> 03:17:09.200]  which is always busy on Thursday.
[03:17:11.880 --> 03:17:12.800]  I'll hit her up again.
[03:17:22.450 --> 03:17:24.930]  Sorry, I'm so I'm looking at the
[03:17:25.170 --> 03:17:27.290]  I'm scrolling through the chat right now.
[03:17:30.500 --> 03:17:31.860]  All right, well, you're scroll.
[03:17:31.860 --> 03:17:32.980]  I do.
[03:17:33.700 --> 03:17:34.140]  I do.
[03:17:34.140 --> 03:17:35.780]  I do take that to heart.
[03:17:35.780 --> 03:17:37.380]  I hear you loud and clear.
[03:17:41.260 --> 03:17:42.900]  Again, if people can start
[03:17:42.900 --> 03:17:44.260]  lobbying names in
[03:17:45.380 --> 03:17:46.740]  and then I'm also like, fuck,
[03:17:47.060 --> 03:17:50.460]  was that like in the YouTube chat?
[03:17:50.460 --> 03:17:51.620]  Did I see something?
[03:17:51.620 --> 03:17:52.980]  Was it someone texted me?
[03:17:52.980 --> 03:17:53.940]  Someone emailed me.
[03:17:53.940 --> 03:17:55.260]  Someone DM to me.
[03:17:57.380 --> 03:17:59.660]  So anyway, if people can.
[03:18:01.220 --> 03:18:02.780]  Help change that,
[03:18:03.140 --> 03:18:04.420]  that would be amazing.
[03:18:05.500 --> 03:18:07.900]  And you can always find Brian.
[03:18:08.860 --> 03:18:12.100]  At his address or me at my address,
[03:18:12.100 --> 03:18:12.620]  that's right.
[03:18:13.420 --> 03:18:14.540]  We can spread it out.
[03:18:15.500 --> 03:18:16.700]  Yeah, for sure.
[03:18:16.900 --> 03:18:17.420]  We're here.
[03:18:17.420 --> 03:18:18.380]  We're here for you people.
[03:18:18.580 --> 03:18:19.300]  Everybody. Yeah.
[03:18:19.300 --> 03:18:20.700]  Now, I'm not asking you
[03:18:20.700 --> 03:18:22.540]  specifically to be the secretary.
[03:18:22.540 --> 03:18:25.540]  I'm saying if we had somebody who
[03:18:26.940 --> 03:18:28.060]  like, for example, today
[03:18:28.060 --> 03:18:30.340]  we had a volunteer to timestamp
[03:18:31.220 --> 03:18:32.780]  multi hour sessions.
[03:18:33.100 --> 03:18:35.540]  So people people can find stuff
[03:18:35.540 --> 03:18:36.660]  a little bit easier.
[03:18:37.700 --> 03:18:39.300]  Ms. Jill has been on.
[03:18:39.300 --> 03:18:40.900]  But yeah, she would be a good
[03:18:41.500 --> 03:18:42.700]  person to bring back.
[03:18:42.700 --> 03:18:43.820]  Who volunteered for that?
[03:18:43.820 --> 03:18:45.580]  Because they deserve a shout out for that.
[03:18:46.580 --> 03:18:48.740]  I'm actually blanking on who that was,
[03:18:48.740 --> 03:18:50.940]  but they're probably watching right now.
[03:18:50.980 --> 03:18:53.620]  It's in my email, I believe.
[03:18:53.940 --> 03:18:54.500]  Hold on.
[03:18:55.180 --> 03:18:57.380]  That's what like my brain's mush.
[03:19:01.900 --> 03:19:05.660]  That may have been.
[03:19:07.260 --> 03:19:08.780]  I eBay, but tender, right?
[03:19:09.140 --> 03:19:10.380]  From like an hour ago.
[03:19:10.740 --> 03:19:13.140]  See, that's how I'm like,
[03:19:13.140 --> 03:19:15.180]  I'm like a goldfish with the memory.
[03:19:17.340 --> 03:19:18.900]  There's another one right there
[03:19:18.900 --> 03:19:21.020]  from little Mac 86.
[03:19:22.020 --> 03:19:24.020]  I don't dare try to pronounce that.
[03:19:26.380 --> 03:19:28.020]  And then we also have.
[03:19:29.900 --> 03:19:31.660]  I think Erica Hernandez,
[03:19:31.660 --> 03:19:33.740]  who's a has a PhD,
[03:19:33.740 --> 03:19:36.020]  is going to do a recurring thing.
[03:19:37.900 --> 03:19:39.300]  And then I also reached out
[03:19:39.300 --> 03:19:41.100]  to another woman
[03:19:41.420 --> 03:19:42.660]  who's on the East Coast
[03:19:42.660 --> 03:19:43.900]  to do something similar,
[03:19:43.900 --> 03:19:45.620]  more kind of medical related.
[03:19:47.500 --> 03:19:49.140]  How about Jessica Bates
[03:19:49.140 --> 03:19:50.340]  and Katie Peterson?
[03:19:50.540 --> 03:19:51.500]  I'm going to call them out.
[03:19:51.500 --> 03:19:52.860]  I've been trying to get them on the show
[03:19:52.860 --> 03:19:55.100]  for at least probably six months.
[03:19:55.100 --> 03:19:56.140]  So I know.
[03:19:57.820 --> 03:19:59.140]  What about Green's got us?
[03:20:00.660 --> 03:20:01.380]  I agree.
[03:20:02.420 --> 03:20:05.020]  And she's been producing content,
[03:20:05.020 --> 03:20:06.020]  which is awesome.
[03:20:06.540 --> 03:20:09.780]  She just put up her brownie
[03:20:10.380 --> 03:20:12.940]  recipe on Channel two.
[03:20:14.060 --> 03:20:15.300]  So she's a contributor.
[03:20:15.300 --> 03:20:16.180]  But yeah, she could.
[03:20:16.540 --> 03:20:17.780]  Christian, back on.
[03:20:18.660 --> 03:20:19.460]  Where do you
[03:20:20.580 --> 03:20:21.500]  Christian Nichols?
[03:20:21.500 --> 03:20:22.220]  There you go.
[03:20:22.300 --> 03:20:22.820]  Yeah.
[03:20:24.340 --> 03:20:29.760]  I'm going to call out House of Heat.
[03:20:30.560 --> 03:20:32.120]  I'd love to have House of Heat on here.
[03:20:32.120 --> 03:20:33.760]  I think there'll be a lot of questions for her.
[03:20:33.760 --> 03:20:35.680]  I think she does a fantastic job.
[03:20:36.240 --> 03:20:38.040]  And I think her brain,
[03:20:38.040 --> 03:20:40.080]  if she's willing, willing to do it,
[03:20:40.080 --> 03:20:40.760]  I think it'd be great
[03:20:40.760 --> 03:20:41.880]  to be able to pick her brain
[03:20:41.880 --> 03:20:42.840]  because her stuff is
[03:20:44.000 --> 03:20:47.080]  consistent at such a high level.
[03:20:47.120 --> 03:20:48.520]  Miss Rad Reefer's been on
[03:20:48.520 --> 03:20:50.520]  this very same show, right?
[03:20:50.960 --> 03:20:51.960]  Yeah, we've had her on.
[03:20:51.960 --> 03:20:53.400]  Shout out to Miss Rad Reefer.
[03:20:55.920 --> 03:20:59.040]  Yes, this is the hive mind at work.
[03:20:59.920 --> 03:21:01.040]  Canna Queen.
[03:21:03.000 --> 03:21:03.800]  Never heard of her.
[03:21:03.800 --> 03:21:04.560]  Canna Queen.
[03:21:09.330 --> 03:21:09.850]  Yeah.
[03:21:09.850 --> 03:21:14.920]  Heal Thyself Gardens, we've had her.
[03:21:14.920 --> 03:21:15.440]  Yeah.
[03:21:16.360 --> 03:21:17.560]  Shout out to that whole,
[03:21:17.560 --> 03:21:19.160]  the two brilliant minds.
[03:21:20.160 --> 03:21:20.680]  Yeah.
[03:21:20.920 --> 03:21:22.040]  The two brilliant minds.
[03:21:24.840 --> 03:21:27.040]  Canna, there's an all women
[03:21:27.040 --> 03:21:29.920]  employed farm somewhere in SoCal
[03:21:30.200 --> 03:21:31.720]  that was on Canna Cribs.
[03:21:32.880 --> 03:21:33.800]  Sunbolt.
[03:21:34.000 --> 03:21:35.280]  Yeah, she's,
[03:21:36.280 --> 03:21:37.600]  that's who we were talking about.
[03:21:41.400 --> 03:21:43.960]  So anyway, we have some work ahead of us.
[03:21:43.960 --> 03:21:47.520]  Also a little more ethnic diversity,
[03:21:47.920 --> 03:21:50.360]  as I see the four white dudes.
[03:21:50.960 --> 03:21:53.240]  Yeah, I'm down with that, too.
[03:21:55.240 --> 03:21:57.640]  Hey, so Brothers Grow Too,
[03:21:57.640 --> 03:21:59.680]  if you ever hear this,
[03:22:00.080 --> 03:22:00.880]  I would love to have you
[03:22:00.880 --> 03:22:01.760]  come on the show, man.
[03:22:02.720 --> 03:22:03.400]  I don't know what happened
[03:22:03.400 --> 03:22:04.360]  to your social media,
[03:22:04.360 --> 03:22:05.840]  but if you see this,
[03:22:05.840 --> 03:22:07.280]  somebody could reach out to his name
[03:22:07.280 --> 03:22:08.840]  as Michael Jackson or MJ.
[03:22:09.160 --> 03:22:10.160]  Brothers Grow Too.
[03:22:10.640 --> 03:22:11.600]  Shout out to you, dude.
[03:22:12.160 --> 03:22:13.880]  I feel like you definitely deserve
[03:22:13.880 --> 03:22:15.320]  a platform to tell your story.
[03:22:16.680 --> 03:22:18.120]  Now, do you think he remember
[03:22:18.120 --> 03:22:20.120]  the office space where he's
[03:22:20.400 --> 03:22:22.240]  has his name is Michael Bolton?
[03:22:22.480 --> 03:22:24.720]  Do you think he positively associates
[03:22:24.720 --> 03:22:26.080]  having the name Michael Jackson
[03:22:26.080 --> 03:22:27.560]  or negatively associates it?
[03:22:28.520 --> 03:22:29.200]  Well, he likes it.
[03:22:29.200 --> 03:22:30.400]  Everybody calls him MJ.
[03:22:30.480 --> 03:22:32.680]  So I feel like that probably explains it.
[03:22:34.240 --> 03:22:36.040]  And then every time you hang out with him,
[03:22:36.040 --> 03:22:38.560]  they go, oh, man, is that your real name?
[03:22:38.720 --> 03:22:41.840]  Just like, yeah, no, I actually have a video
[03:22:41.840 --> 03:22:45.000]  of me and her chilling in L.A.
[03:22:45.200 --> 03:22:47.320]  that's up on the YouTube somewhere.
[03:22:47.320 --> 03:22:48.880]  If you just Google her
[03:22:49.680 --> 03:22:50.840]  or on YouTube.
[03:22:52.200 --> 03:22:54.560]  Pebbles, we were supposed
[03:22:54.560 --> 03:22:56.280]  to do something with her
[03:22:56.640 --> 03:22:58.280]  like two years ago, but yeah,
[03:22:58.280 --> 03:22:59.120]  she would be great.
[03:23:01.200 --> 03:23:04.680]  Up at there was something in Mendocino
[03:23:05.680 --> 03:23:07.960]  and then it was during the fire.
[03:23:08.000 --> 03:23:11.640]  So Leo, who is going to film the interview.
[03:23:14.360 --> 03:23:15.880]  The fire was in his neighborhood,
[03:23:15.880 --> 03:23:18.160]  so we had to race back to Sonoma.
[03:23:19.880 --> 03:23:20.400]  What?
[03:23:20.880 --> 03:23:21.880]  I just lost.
[03:23:22.440 --> 03:23:24.840]  But now this is we need to.
[03:23:26.040 --> 03:23:28.360]  We need to tap into the hive mind
[03:23:29.680 --> 03:23:30.640]  more frequently.
[03:23:30.640 --> 03:23:32.600]  Yeah, the kind of the whole
[03:23:33.040 --> 03:23:34.800]  most of the Dragonfly crew.
[03:23:36.680 --> 03:23:37.640]  We've had them on.
[03:23:38.920 --> 03:23:41.280]  Now, I'm not just saying Kelly,
[03:23:41.280 --> 03:23:45.440]  I'm saying like the the all the Dem farms,
[03:23:45.840 --> 03:23:46.680]  a lot of them.
[03:23:49.880 --> 03:23:50.880]  Painted lady.
[03:23:52.560 --> 03:23:56.530]  Yeah, she does great work.
[03:23:58.210 --> 03:24:04.360]  So we are currently streaming to
[03:24:05.800 --> 03:24:08.800]  one sex chat bot on.
[03:24:09.960 --> 03:24:11.760]  Is it on Twitch or is it on?
[03:24:13.760 --> 03:24:14.560]  What is that?
[03:24:16.040 --> 03:24:18.280]  That's not it.
[03:24:18.320 --> 03:24:20.280]  Yeah, we are streaming to Twitch.
[03:24:21.960 --> 03:24:24.880]  There is probably zero zero zero.
[03:24:25.320 --> 03:24:27.840]  To one person currently watching on Twitch
[03:24:27.840 --> 03:24:30.440]  and usually it's a chat like you guys don't see it.
[03:24:30.440 --> 03:24:31.920]  But I see like.
[03:24:33.240 --> 03:24:36.880]  You know, sex chat, but comments
[03:24:36.880 --> 03:24:38.920]  fairly frequently coming from the Twitch.
[03:24:42.600 --> 03:24:43.120]  Anyway.
[03:24:45.440 --> 03:24:49.280]  So we wrap this up so I can roll.
[03:24:50.160 --> 03:24:50.760]  Sure.
[03:24:51.720 --> 03:24:53.360]  As soon as you start bringing up sex bots,
[03:24:53.360 --> 03:24:55.440]  everybody's time to get going.
[03:24:56.480 --> 03:24:57.280]  Yeah, I gotta go.
[03:24:58.520 --> 03:25:00.680]  I think some people are leaning in on that.
[03:25:00.720 --> 03:25:01.320]  God, what?
[03:25:03.560 --> 03:25:06.040]  So thank you so much, brother.
[03:25:07.240 --> 03:25:10.480]  And here here's my handy dandy calendar.
[03:25:10.920 --> 03:25:12.520]  We got hotes, a herb.
[03:25:16.600 --> 03:25:18.920]  What can I do this one day?
[03:25:20.120 --> 03:25:20.680]  Look at that.
[03:25:20.800 --> 03:25:21.800]  6 p.m.
[03:25:21.800 --> 03:25:23.240]  tonight Pacific time.
[03:25:23.240 --> 03:25:24.760]  We got hotes a herb.
[03:25:25.800 --> 03:25:26.920]  Can we go to tomorrow?
[03:25:27.240 --> 03:25:27.760]  Yes.
[03:25:27.800 --> 03:25:28.440]  Hold on.
[03:25:28.880 --> 03:25:31.480]  Tomorrow we have another series on compost.
[03:25:32.360 --> 03:25:33.920]  OK, I have to put that in the calendar.
[03:25:36.360 --> 03:25:37.120]  How do I?
[03:25:39.000 --> 03:25:39.680]  Hold on.
[03:25:41.160 --> 03:25:41.680]  Aha.
[03:25:41.720 --> 03:25:42.320]  Look at that.
[03:25:44.480 --> 03:25:44.760]  All right.
[03:25:44.760 --> 03:25:48.520]  So Layton is going to be somewhere in here on clubhouse.
[03:25:48.920 --> 03:25:49.400]  You can't.
[03:25:49.400 --> 03:25:50.080]  Can you get that?
[03:25:50.680 --> 03:25:55.400]  You guys see my mouse now, but somewhere between state of cannabis news hour and the
[03:25:55.400 --> 03:25:59.520]  Oakster Dam homegrow thing, we're going to be Chad.
[03:26:00.960 --> 03:26:01.480]  Two to four.
[03:26:01.480 --> 03:26:01.720]  What?
[03:26:02.480 --> 03:26:03.040]  Two to four.
[03:26:03.040 --> 03:26:03.400]  OK.
[03:26:03.440 --> 03:26:08.360]  And then Chad will have Dutch blooms back again.
[03:26:10.080 --> 03:26:15.760]  And then Chad has his every other Saturday show on Saturday.
[03:26:16.640 --> 03:26:17.160]  So.
[03:26:18.720 --> 03:26:22.840]  Anyway, that's my my calendar.
[03:26:24.480 --> 03:26:25.120]  All right.
[03:26:26.280 --> 03:26:33.880]  Yes, these are big moves with the keeping the calendar, it's actually fairly helpful.
[03:26:34.200 --> 03:26:34.720]  I'm sorry.
[03:26:34.720 --> 03:26:36.080]  And then Elka next week.
[03:26:36.200 --> 03:26:38.760]  So but I'll have more on that next week.
[03:26:38.880 --> 03:26:42.520]  So anyway, with that, do you guys know who's next week or not yet?
[03:26:44.280 --> 03:26:45.560]  Still trying to work on that.
[03:26:46.400 --> 03:26:48.280]  OK, Brian, there's.
[03:26:50.520 --> 03:26:54.360]  There's a lot of a lot of pressure on you to make next week.
[03:26:55.440 --> 03:26:56.000]  A woman.
[03:26:58.360 --> 03:26:58.760]  All right.
[03:26:59.400 --> 03:26:59.920]  Got this.
[03:27:01.040 --> 03:27:03.160]  Holy shit, there is someone on Twitch.
[03:27:03.640 --> 03:27:06.520]  Wait, I don't know if this is a bot, but.
[03:27:08.160 --> 03:27:10.360]  Shadow match is listening.
[03:27:10.360 --> 03:27:15.400]  Does not seem like a bot, but that's a we have a shadow, a verbal.
[03:27:15.720 --> 03:27:16.520]  Oh, my God.
[03:27:18.040 --> 03:27:18.720]  Shadow match.
[03:27:18.720 --> 03:27:20.640]  How many people are watching on Twitch right now?
[03:27:20.640 --> 03:27:21.480]  Is it just you?
[03:27:22.880 --> 03:27:23.720]  No, not a bot.
[03:27:23.760 --> 03:27:24.280]  OK.
[03:27:25.720 --> 03:27:27.280]  This artificial intelligence.
[03:27:27.280 --> 03:27:28.360]  We know you're not a bot.
[03:27:28.360 --> 03:27:28.960]  I know this.
[03:27:28.960 --> 03:27:30.160]  I would say.
[03:27:33.160 --> 03:27:34.520]  Wait, who owns Twitch?
[03:27:34.520 --> 03:27:35.440]  Isn't that just me?
[03:27:36.720 --> 03:27:37.960]  Shadow matches.
[03:27:38.440 --> 03:27:39.720]  Shadow matches.
[03:27:40.560 --> 03:27:41.720]  I appreciate.
[03:27:41.720 --> 03:27:44.120]  Yeah, we need we need the shadow match.
[03:27:44.320 --> 03:27:46.440]  Get some more people watching on Twitch.
[03:27:47.840 --> 03:27:50.360]  I'm always like, I know people are on Twitch, but.
[03:27:52.080 --> 03:27:54.480]  Yes, and we have a shout out to all the sex bots.
[03:27:59.000 --> 03:28:00.000]  Anyway, all right.
[03:28:00.000 --> 03:28:00.680]  Can't make this.
[03:28:02.800 --> 03:28:06.920]  I appreciate I'm sending the most love to our one switch
[03:28:07.640 --> 03:28:08.320]  viewer.
[03:28:09.560 --> 03:28:12.720]  You deserve it because you could be over on YouTube watching with
[03:28:13.240 --> 03:28:15.640]  oh, my God, and on Facebook, we have some.
[03:28:16.120 --> 03:28:19.240]  Yeah, Facebook Windsor appreciated.
[03:28:22.500 --> 03:28:24.820]  Yeah, Joseph doesn't even know what Twitch is.
[03:28:27.260 --> 03:28:32.420]  But anyway, Windsor, I also appreciate you over on the book of faces.
[03:28:33.620 --> 03:28:37.780]  And to everybody in the YouTube chat, we appreciate you as well.
[03:28:39.060 --> 03:28:40.660]  Oh, man, it's going to be a metaverse.
[03:28:42.060 --> 03:28:43.300]  It's not Facebook anymore.
[03:28:44.220 --> 03:28:45.220]  You guys ready?
[03:28:45.900 --> 03:28:46.900]  Yes, we are.
[03:28:47.140 --> 03:28:48.660]  All right. Thanks, all audience.
[03:28:48.780 --> 03:28:49.780]  Peace out.
[03:28:49.900 --> 03:28:50.780]  See you guys next week.
