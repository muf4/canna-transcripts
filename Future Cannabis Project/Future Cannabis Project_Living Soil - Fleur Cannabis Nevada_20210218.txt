[00:00.510 --> 00:10.870]  Good morning, boys and girls. We are live broadcasting in 1080p high definition. So
[00:10.870 --> 00:19.270]  welcome everyone. This is our crew. We got Colorado in the house. We got Oxnard and we
[00:19.270 --> 00:27.390]  got Las Vegas, Nevada. So take it away, Brian. Yeah. Welcome Living Soil Nerds. Happy Thursday
[00:27.390 --> 00:31.510]  to you back with the regular crew like Peter just mentioned. Shout out to obviously the
[00:31.510 --> 00:37.750]  Future Cannabis Project, Mr. Leighton Morrison and Evan today. We're going to be talking
[00:37.750 --> 00:43.710]  really deeper on experience and what it really takes to cultivate with Living Soil on a commercial
[00:43.710 --> 00:47.550]  level. I also want to give a shout out to my boy, Daguerre Forgé, always setting up
[00:47.550 --> 00:52.310]  all the IT stuff behind the scenes. I really appreciate you, buddy. And we keep improving
[00:52.310 --> 00:57.670]  week by week. So today we want to get more into understanding really the experience that
[00:57.670 --> 01:02.390]  Evan has. We were right before we came live, we were talking about that. You know, I think
[01:02.390 --> 01:07.230]  it was two years ago, Evan and I were on the stage in Las Vegas at the Urban Expo. And
[01:07.230 --> 01:11.790]  we were kind of on like a small debate stage where two people were talking about synthetics.
[01:11.790 --> 01:16.070]  There it is. And two of us, obviously on the right hand side, are talking about Living
[01:16.070 --> 01:21.270]  Soil. And for what it was, I felt like it was a fantastic discussion. It was one of
[01:21.270 --> 01:26.470]  the first times when I was on stage and that kind of stuff where I felt like people were
[01:26.470 --> 01:30.950]  really resonating with what the speakers were talking about. So everybody on that panel,
[01:30.950 --> 01:35.030]  kudos to them, because I feel like we were really speaking to the audience that day.
[01:35.030 --> 01:39.350]  That's why I chose to bring Evan on today as well, because we want to kind of dive deeper
[01:39.350 --> 01:46.310]  into what it really takes, man, to build Living Soil systems on a commercial level.
[01:46.310 --> 01:50.270]  For sure. Yeah. Thanks for having me on the show, guys. I really appreciate it, man. It's
[01:50.270 --> 01:56.390]  a pleasure to join you guys. Excited to have you, brother. Yeah, for sure. So I think that
[01:56.390 --> 01:59.830]  we're doing something really cutting edge out here, you know, growing in Living Soil
[01:59.830 --> 02:08.870]  when the majority of the large scale cannabis cultivation facilities are hydroponic. I'd
[02:08.870 --> 02:13.990]  say maybe less than 1% are doing it the way we're doing it. And to me, I think it's the
[02:13.990 --> 02:20.990]  future of the business, knowing what I know now and having done this hydroponically and
[02:20.990 --> 02:26.150]  organically, it makes so much more sense to do it organically. So as far as scaling up
[02:26.150 --> 02:33.230]  goes, you know, we just basically replicated what a lot of people would do in their homes.
[02:33.230 --> 02:38.670]  As far as Living Soil goes, it's really more about maintaining the environment when you're
[02:38.670 --> 02:44.990]  doing it large scale. And, you know, we're able to do that as well. One of the biggest
[02:44.990 --> 02:47.710]  challenges we face, hold on a second, let me get out of here, it's getting a little
[02:47.710 --> 02:51.550]  bit noisy. One of the bigger challenges we face, and you guys probably help us out a
[02:51.550 --> 02:57.910]  lot, and there's Nate. Nate just joined us as well. So one of the things is feeding the
[02:57.910 --> 03:03.430]  worms, you know, getting enough organic matter in that soil to make sure the worms stay fed.
[03:03.430 --> 03:07.710]  That's been one of the bigger challenges. Another challenge has been dealing with roly
[03:07.710 --> 03:14.590]  polies. We came into a facility that had literally millions of roly polies in it,
[03:14.590 --> 03:17.870]  and controlling their numbers has been challenging. And, you know, that's something that we've
[03:17.870 --> 03:23.830]  learned to do and we're still learning. But yeah, happy to answer any questions you have.
[03:23.830 --> 03:24.830]  And so is Nate.
[03:24.830 --> 03:30.290]  Excellent. Let's kind of dive deeper into what you guys are doing there. I know a lot
[03:30.290 --> 03:33.790]  of people this week were excited that we were going to have more of like a garden tour with
[03:33.790 --> 03:37.910]  you guys so we can kind of talk more about and see in real time what you guys are doing.
[03:37.910 --> 03:41.990]  There's a lot of information out there, and I feel like a lot of us should just be judged
[03:41.990 --> 03:46.190]  by on the way that we're growing our plants. And so if the plants are taking off and things
[03:46.190 --> 03:51.350]  are fantastic, I feel like that's something to listen to. And, you know, when we first
[03:51.350 --> 03:54.630]  were on that stage two years ago, I feel like some people were thinking like reusing your
[03:54.630 --> 03:58.110]  soil, you know, afterwards they're coming up and it does kind of sound too good to be
[03:58.110 --> 04:02.910]  true. And then I remember, you know, as I continued to, you know, push living soil,
[04:02.910 --> 04:06.390]  a lot of people after we would give discussions and that kind of thing would come up and be
[04:06.390 --> 04:10.110]  like, yeah, this is great, but there's no way that you could do that at scale. So that's
[04:10.110 --> 04:14.870]  one of the reasons I want to talk to you. And there's been a few others on Peter's show
[04:14.870 --> 04:21.230]  here that have been able to show that at scale. So I'm excited to show, you know, your world
[04:21.230 --> 04:25.350]  to the Future Cannabis Project and so that you, the viewers can kind of see in real time
[04:25.350 --> 04:27.430]  what a successful farm looks like.
[04:27.430 --> 04:31.910]  Yeah, for sure. And I believe Nate, Nate, which room are you in right now?
[04:31.910 --> 04:33.910]  I'm up in 2B.
[04:33.910 --> 04:40.110]  Okay, so Nate is in one of our rooms right now. What stage is that in Nate?
[04:40.110 --> 04:47.470]  We're about week two flower. I believe we just switched over Wednesday, would have started
[04:47.470 --> 04:48.470]  week two.
[04:48.470 --> 04:49.990]  Can you turn your phone sideways?
[04:49.990 --> 04:52.950]  Can you like a TV landscape?
[04:52.950 --> 04:59.110]  Okay, shoot. Yeah, I see what you're saying.
[04:59.110 --> 05:00.110]  It's going to flip.
[05:01.110 --> 05:02.110]  There we go.
[05:02.110 --> 05:05.110]  Look at that. That's the money shot.
[05:05.110 --> 05:08.110]  Yeah, very nice.
[05:08.110 --> 05:14.750]  So this is, I believe, our second biggest room in the building. I believe it's right
[05:14.750 --> 05:22.390]  around 4,500 square feet. Let's see here.
[05:22.390 --> 05:23.390]  You got to keep your phone.
[05:23.390 --> 05:24.390]  I think I lost everyone.
[05:24.390 --> 05:25.390]  No, we can hear you.
[05:25.390 --> 05:26.870]  Yeah, you're good. Just keep the phone sideways.
[05:26.870 --> 05:27.870]  Okay.
[05:27.870 --> 05:28.870]  Just keep the phone sideways.
[05:29.630 --> 05:37.990]  So just to kind of give a background of what we're doing and kind of how the organics and
[05:37.990 --> 05:45.950]  the opportunity came about here. I was a biochemistry student at UNLV. A lot of molecular physiology
[05:45.950 --> 05:56.150]  and organic synthesis was where I did focus a lot of my study. And I really was interested
[05:56.190 --> 06:02.190]  in the agricultural side of it as opposed to more of like a human biology and like medical
[06:02.190 --> 06:15.350]  aspect of it. So the undergraduate at UNLV was very, just very, I wouldn't say basic,
[06:15.350 --> 06:23.910]  but very much geared towards the medical realm and human biology. So a lot of the plant research,
[06:23.910 --> 06:29.470]  I really had to dig out and do on my own. And I was diving really deep into all these
[06:29.470 --> 06:36.590]  mechanisms of how the plant functions. And there was a big disconnect between knowing
[06:36.590 --> 06:43.430]  all these processes and, okay, well, how do you apply that into a working system? And
[06:43.430 --> 06:51.190]  one of the biggest connections for me was I stumbled upon the JADAM KNF book about four
[06:51.190 --> 06:58.590]  or five years ago. And just the theory behind it was like, to me, it bridged the gap between
[06:58.590 --> 07:08.030]  the molecular aspect of really the physiology of what's going on, the biomechanics, to kind of how
[07:08.030 --> 07:14.830]  you can apply that in a natural feeding way. And the more I dug into it, the more I realized that
[07:14.950 --> 07:20.630]  you didn't really need to buy a whole lot of fertilizer and that you can operate one of these
[07:20.630 --> 07:29.430]  gardens on a massive scale pretty simply just by following some basic principles. And so we've kind
[07:29.430 --> 07:34.790]  of been playing around with a lot of different things. This was my first jump into commercial
[07:34.790 --> 07:42.030]  growing from a year and a half ago. This was a little system that I was kind of just a little
[07:42.070 --> 07:49.430]  brainchild that I was thinking of and working in a little five by 10 tent. So the jump was a little
[07:49.430 --> 07:55.470]  intimidating at first, without question. And it just kind of been a work in progress. We've been
[07:55.510 --> 08:00.510]  applying a whole lot of different, pretty much any, we're trying to go with what makes sense
[08:00.510 --> 08:07.470]  biologically, instead of trying to stick to one certain style of growing. It's like, oh, you have
[08:07.470 --> 08:11.710]  to do it this way. If you're doing KNF, you have to do it this way. Whatever you're adding
[08:11.710 --> 08:17.750]  organic amendments to your soil. So we kind of hybridized a lot of things in a sense of just
[08:17.750 --> 08:26.270]  kind of what makes sense biologically. And so we've tried a lot of different things and we're
[08:26.270 --> 08:30.990]  just kind of, you know, taking notes on what's worked and what we can kind of do away with. And
[08:31.590 --> 08:33.550]  so far, it seems to be working pretty well.
[08:36.470 --> 08:41.190]  It looks fantastic. The viewers would love if you could kind of just like walk through the garden.
[08:41.190 --> 08:42.270]  Is that is that possible?
[08:42.310 --> 08:47.870]  Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. And actually, Nate, you can flip it. So you use the camera on the other
[08:47.870 --> 08:53.550]  side of your phone. So you don't have to do it like selfie mode. If you hit that camera sprocket,
[08:53.790 --> 08:57.910]  and then pick camera source as the other camera on the opposite side.
[08:58.670 --> 09:02.350]  And that's down here on the camera. Whoops. All right, let's see here.
[09:03.150 --> 09:06.350]  And while you're doing that, we'll cut to Evan in room two.
[09:07.270 --> 09:14.110]  Yeah, this is our latest stage room. Another thing we did was, when we came into this building, we
[09:14.110 --> 09:25.230]  have two floors here. Actually, let me take this off. So we have two stories. And the bottom floor,
[09:25.310 --> 09:30.590]  or Nate is up on our top floor. And that's all four by eight beds. And then in the bottom floor,
[09:30.590 --> 09:36.910]  we had all 30 gallon pots. And that was a bitch. We had a lot of issues with the 30 gallon pot. So
[09:37.310 --> 09:43.590]  one of our goals, right off the bat was to get out of those 30 gallon pots, and into larger size
[09:43.590 --> 09:48.630]  beds. And that's what we have in this room. We were in our second cycle in this room now with
[09:49.790 --> 09:54.030]  more than half the soil is the old soil. And then we had to move into some new soil to fill these
[09:54.030 --> 10:02.710]  beds up because we have these big, they're 20 foot and 16 foot 24 inch deep beds. And they've made a
[10:02.710 --> 10:07.670]  world of a difference for us. And so in this room, I believe what do we have, I think around 12 in
[10:07.670 --> 10:11.030]  this room. As you can see.
[10:15.710 --> 10:20.790]  I got a question for you guys. Have you been doing any biological testing to see what you have in
[10:20.790 --> 10:21.670]  your soil system?
[10:22.670 --> 10:30.790]  Yes, yes, we have. We were using sustainable plant solutions. And we've been looking at other options as well.
[10:31.430 --> 10:35.910]  With sustainable plant solutions, they were great. But we're also looking for a little bit more
[10:35.910 --> 10:41.390]  information as to, you know, somebody to kind of partner up with us to and give us suggestions on what we
[10:41.390 --> 10:44.950]  should be feeding the soil if there's anything that we are short on, and we don't have the answers for.
[10:44.950 --> 10:48.670]  Maybe there's other people out there that can work with us. Whereas they would just kind of just say,
[10:48.670 --> 10:53.750]  okay, this is where you're at, and wouldn't give you any information on what to do. So we're basically
[10:53.750 --> 10:55.790]  been figuring all that out for the past year and a half.
[10:56.590 --> 11:01.710]  Just quickly, Nate, can you go back to landscape rather than portrait?
[11:03.790 --> 11:04.630]  There you go.
[11:07.910 --> 11:11.670]  It's hard to get used to Nate when you're probably yeah, I get I get Nate's pain. It's hard to hold
[11:11.670 --> 11:12.710]  your phone like this for a while.
[11:13.710 --> 11:18.830]  Well, you must have a hell of a steel building to have that much weight on the second floor.
[11:19.390 --> 11:24.910]  Oh, yeah. Yeah, actually, they did a load calculation before they moved all that soil up in there. And
[11:24.910 --> 11:30.390]  that's actually why we can't go with larger beds upstairs. Why you see the 18 inch beds, just because
[11:30.390 --> 11:35.030]  the floors wouldn't be able to handle that amount of soil. But yeah, there's a shitload of weight up in
[11:35.030 --> 11:41.230]  the in those rooms. And this was a concrete building to it wasn't a metal building, or steel building.
[11:41.230 --> 11:45.910]  They you know, this building was built right it was it was it was done very well when the owners of this
[11:45.910 --> 11:54.710]  project initially built this place out for medical marijuana back in 2015. They spent $15 million on
[11:54.710 --> 12:00.910]  this build out. And they spared no expense. I mean, if you if you want to cut back to me real quick to
[12:00.910 --> 12:06.310]  that you can see above me, we have all this mechanical engineer all this ductwork dropping down out of
[12:06.310 --> 12:12.270]  the ceiling. I've never seen a grow do this before. And it's literally like, you know, every I believe five or
[12:12.270 --> 12:18.190]  six feet, we have drop down ducts over the plants and you can see and we just have the perfect
[12:18.190 --> 12:23.550]  environment in every one of these rooms. Now there's no hot spots. There's no there's no wet spots, no
[12:23.550 --> 12:25.950]  dried spots. It's just it's perfect everywhere you walk.
[12:26.870 --> 12:32.310]  Are those are those drop downs fresh air in or air exhaust?
[12:32.310 --> 12:38.870]  That's no those are air in and so there's very, very little air coming in from outside. You know, with code I believe
[12:38.870 --> 12:46.550]  you have to have about 2% on the outside air coming into your rooms. So there's very, very, very little outside air
[12:46.550 --> 12:47.590]  coming into these rooms.
[12:50.070 --> 12:53.910]  So those are just basically heating and cooling with a fresh air makeup somewhere in the
[12:53.950 --> 12:56.030]  but those are straight air conditioning units.
[12:58.390 --> 13:00.830]  Correct. Well, correct. Well, yes.
[13:00.950 --> 13:07.670]  Exactly. And also these rooms have to be able to purge to you know, Nevada, when they made us build these places out, they
[13:07.710 --> 13:14.310]  were very strict on the building code. You know, you couldn't just go into a warehouse and throw up some lights and
[13:14.310 --> 13:19.070]  throwing some beds or whatever you had to really meet their codes and they were pretty strict depending on which
[13:19.070 --> 13:24.230]  jurisdiction you're in. We're in unincorporated Clark County. And that's one of the stricter jurisdictions it was, you
[13:24.230 --> 13:27.550]  know, it's not easy to get through what they make you go through. And that's hence the reason why these guys spent
[13:27.550 --> 13:28.110]  $15 million.
[13:30.110 --> 13:32.110]  Yeah, unfortunately, the codes tend to do that.
[13:32.110 --> 13:38.590]  But it did it right. You know, it did it right. Like we said, and that it's part of the reason why you know, part of the
[13:38.590 --> 13:43.230]  reason why we're passing the test so well, it's it's definitely a lot to do with the grow methods that Nate has
[13:43.230 --> 13:47.630]  brought in here. And a lot of the protocol that we've, you know, established with our IPM and other things that we
[13:47.630 --> 13:54.350]  do, but also having a building that is just, you know, second to none, we can just control environment and
[13:54.350 --> 14:00.110]  here like, like, you know, perfectly and and to be able to do that we're we're passing, you know, Nevada has some of
[14:00.110 --> 14:06.110]  the strictest testing in the world possibly the strictest testing and, and we're passing like over 98% of our tests,
[14:06.110 --> 14:13.310]  which pretty much unheard of the failure rate in Nevada is about 15%. So we're well below that threshold. Our lab
[14:13.310 --> 14:17.310]  tells us that there's nobody even coming close to you know, the amount of passive test results that they're seeing
[14:17.310 --> 14:18.750]  from us. So that's good.
[14:18.750 --> 14:23.870]  That's fantastic. Are you also doing cannabinoid tests as well to see what you're actually coming out with?
[14:25.310 --> 14:32.990]  Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. That's, you know, the tests here. And that's a big selling point here in Nevada is those
[14:32.990 --> 14:39.710]  tests. dispensaries are basically buying based on the test results. And so if you're not hitting the mark on your
[14:39.710 --> 14:45.550]  tests, if you're not hitting above 20% total THC, if you're selling something, you're not getting the results.
[14:45.550 --> 14:51.790]  You're not going to do well here. You know, they're, they're very, it's very THC driven. When it was still the
[14:51.790 --> 14:58.750]  medical market, we finally got it to a point where it was people were dying based on terpene profiles. But as soon as
[14:58.750 --> 15:05.550]  it became recreational here, I'm sure the Colorado with you guys just went straight back to you know, highest THC
[15:05.550 --> 15:11.550]  cells. So that's one of the challenges that we had in here. We couldn't get the results. And so we had to
[15:11.550 --> 15:18.030]  So that's one of the challenges that we had in here. We came in and there was a lot of low testing strains we've had in here.
[15:18.030 --> 15:23.150]  But we're fortunate that we have a phenol hunting room. So we've been phenol hunting like crazy, ever since we started here
[15:23.150 --> 15:29.950]  and just been bringing in new strain after new strain and stuff that's testing really high. For example, right behind me, right here.
[15:31.550 --> 15:37.550]  So these are two strains actually this one right here is I don't know how well you can see that. But that is called
[15:37.550 --> 15:44.030]  Gushido OG. These are both a cross of Lemon OG and Wookiees and Cream. And then behind it is our
[15:44.030 --> 15:49.950]  sister plant. We're calling that one Katana OG. And they are just chunky monkeys, man. You can see
[15:49.950 --> 15:50.990]  they are chunking up.
[15:53.230 --> 15:57.710]  So what other genetics are you working on, Evan? That was some of the other questions. Everybody, you know, everybody
[15:57.710 --> 16:00.750]  always wants to know what's going on inside the in the grow room.
[16:02.270 --> 16:03.230]  What kind of genetics?
[16:03.710 --> 16:08.270]  Yeah, what kind of other genetics do you guys really enjoying farming, especially at the commercial?
[16:08.270 --> 16:12.510]  So, you know, the majority of the plants down in these rooms that the downstairs rooms we grow
[16:12.510 --> 16:17.470]  mostly Sativas and hybrids. Because these rooms we have higher ceiling clearance and plus, you know,
[16:17.470 --> 16:22.750]  we have a lot more space for the roots to spread out. So, for example, right here, this one is
[16:22.750 --> 16:28.030]  called Great Monster. This is one of our top selling strains actually. This, this she's testing
[16:28.030 --> 16:34.270]  around 27-28% with a really good turf profile somewhere between 2-3% total, total turf gains.
[16:35.230 --> 16:39.790]  Again, we're growing a lot of Great Monster because she, she chunks up big time. This is a new,
[16:42.030 --> 16:45.790]  a new plant we're growing. This one's called Sun God. And this actually comes from a breeder Nate
[16:45.790 --> 16:53.550]  knows back east, Microbe Alchemist and another guy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You guys know him.
[16:54.350 --> 16:59.550]  We got to see through him. Yeah, of course. So Nate was buddies with him too. And I,
[16:59.550 --> 17:04.670]  I was following him too on Instagram and we've been doing some pheno hunting with his gear.
[17:04.670 --> 17:09.630]  And we found some good stuff there. And Nate's a big fan of his as well. This is a strain that
[17:09.630 --> 17:13.790]  we had in here prior to me coming in. This is Glue on Fire. It's a really good strain,
[17:13.790 --> 17:19.070]  Face on Fire and Gorilla Glue Frost. That does really well again, super high tester,
[17:19.870 --> 17:24.590]  really high terpenes. Basically everything in this room tests really high in terpenes and decent,
[17:24.590 --> 17:29.550]  decent THC. Everything's normally above 20%. Another strain, this was an in-house breeding
[17:29.550 --> 17:34.750]  project by our, one of our head growers, or actually our head grower runs a grow team. His
[17:34.750 --> 17:41.070]  name is Sven, Sven Blum and Sven, this is a breeding project that he came up with. This is a
[17:41.070 --> 17:46.430]  LA Appi Wookie and LA Confidential Frost. This one is really good. It does really good for us. And
[17:46.430 --> 17:50.110]  this is actually an indigo. It's the only indigo that we grow downstairs, but she used to grow big
[17:50.110 --> 17:58.750]  and tall. And yeah, I believe this is more of that Lala. So just quickly, I had to do it. This is
[17:58.750 --> 17:59.950]  Shout out to Agalora.
[18:06.320 --> 18:14.000]  And then back here, another one we grow, we really liked Miss Africa. So you can see her, she's
[18:14.720 --> 18:18.400]  beautiful. Another, she's straight sativa.
[18:20.480 --> 18:21.920]  And almost no fade on her.
[18:22.800 --> 18:28.160]  No, no, not much. You know, and in these rooms, we know we're, this is only the second run and
[18:28.160 --> 18:33.760]  the soil is, is somewhat new and you know, our first run in it, it was okay, but not great. And
[18:33.760 --> 18:39.360]  we've seen a major increase in size in the plants just on this second run. But you know, the soil
[18:39.360 --> 18:42.320]  isn't there yet. Nate's still working on it. We're getting there though.
[18:43.120 --> 18:47.200]  It's a process. That's why, you know, Leighton and I on this show every Thursday, we're
[18:47.200 --> 18:51.600]  talking to the viewers about trust the process. And this is where, you know, this is where you
[18:51.600 --> 18:56.160]  can get to is once you start to understand these concepts from A to Z, you're going to be able to
[18:56.160 --> 19:01.200]  take those concepts and apply them and continue to grow that out. So we're eventually like Evan here
[19:01.200 --> 19:05.600]  is doing this on, and Nate are doing this on a commercial scale. And obviously the viewers can
[19:05.600 --> 19:10.800]  see that this is top notch. I mean, you're in Las Vegas where I like to go to Las Vegas a lot. And
[19:10.800 --> 19:16.560]  I can assure you that most of the stuff out there that I see is brown. That's just the truth. So I
[19:16.560 --> 19:21.120]  can't imagine what this looks like to her. And that's the other beauty that you guys, it seems
[19:21.120 --> 19:25.680]  like you guys are in a lot of the high-end dispensaries out there in Las Vegas as well.
[19:26.400 --> 19:31.520]  For sure. Yeah. We we're definitely in the majority now. You know, we've been fortunate.
[19:31.520 --> 19:37.600]  We've taken a brand that really wasn't very well known here. And I'd say we're, I don't like to
[19:37.600 --> 19:40.880]  toot my own horn, but I think we're in the top, one of the top five brands in the state right now.
[19:41.920 --> 19:46.080]  We we've worked really hard at it. So, you know, I, and I think that, you know, you have a, with us,
[19:46.080 --> 19:49.440]  you have a bunch of guys that just really care about this plant and really care about the culture.
[19:49.440 --> 19:53.440]  We didn't get into this for the money. We got into this because we love growing weed and, you know,
[19:53.440 --> 19:57.520]  we love the culture and that's, you know, that's what I've surrounded myself with is people like
[19:57.520 --> 20:01.200]  that. And I've always felt that's really important in this industry. I've always felt that the plants
[20:01.200 --> 20:05.600]  really thrive on positive energy and the people around them. And I think we've proven that out
[20:05.600 --> 20:10.480]  over the course of time. You know, I'm so glad you brought that up. It's, it's one of the things
[20:10.480 --> 20:15.360]  that people say is woo woo, but it really isn't. I mean, if you're connecting with your plants
[20:15.360 --> 20:20.000]  and you're in a positive head space, you're going to get positive results. And, you know,
[20:20.000 --> 20:24.800]  so I'm glad you said that it's, it's important for people to understand. It's, it's, it's totally
[20:24.800 --> 20:28.560]  true, you know, and I've seen it in real time. You know, it's, it's funny. I have a little story
[20:28.560 --> 20:34.320]  I like to tell. I had, I had a cultivator here who was having a really bad week and we had him in a
[20:34.320 --> 20:38.960]  room and he was doing up pruning and he was right next to another guy that was not having a bad week
[20:38.960 --> 20:44.560]  and he was just normal and enjoying his day. And they were working on the exact same string. And
[20:45.200 --> 20:49.280]  the cultivator comes to me, he says, Evan, look at all my plants. Why are all my plants drooping?
[20:49.280 --> 20:54.080]  And his are all standing up, praying to God. And I said to him, I was like, well, are you in a bad
[20:54.080 --> 20:57.520]  mood right now? He's like, yeah, I'm having a horrible day. I said, well, that's exactly what
[20:57.520 --> 21:01.360]  the problem is. You're, you're passing all that negative energy to the plants. It literally,
[21:01.360 --> 21:04.960]  it was right there for all of us to see. And sure enough, he was like, holy shit, I think you're
[21:04.960 --> 21:09.040]  right. And you know, plants got back on track, but we didn't have him up for the rest of the day.
[21:11.040 --> 21:17.520]  Good man. I'm telling you, it's, it's really true. I've seen that in, in microscope work.
[21:17.520 --> 21:22.800]  Um, if a person's pissed off, they don't see anything good. And then as soon as you put
[21:22.800 --> 21:27.440]  them next to someone who's in a good head space, all of a sudden they're seeing all kinds of things
[21:27.520 --> 21:32.400]  and it's the same damn soil sample. So I, I thoroughly believe it. And that's nice that
[21:32.400 --> 21:37.200]  you could share that story. Absolutely. Yeah. And it's, it's really the, um, you know, that's the
[21:37.200 --> 21:41.600]  philosophy I've, I've come into this industry with when I, I started, I started a company here
[21:41.600 --> 21:48.880]  in Nevada called matrix NV and I started that with my closest friends and my family. And we were very
[21:48.880 --> 21:52.960]  successful with that, you know, and I felt that that was a big part of the reason why it was
[21:52.960 --> 21:56.960]  just the positive energy that we brought to that building every day. Plus the love of cannabis.
[21:57.120 --> 22:00.480]  If you love something, you're going to do it well. And that's another thing that, you know,
[22:00.480 --> 22:05.040]  heading into this is if you're going to get into this on the commercial scale, what it really takes
[22:05.040 --> 22:10.560]  is complete dedication. You know, I was a guy that, um, I was single. I have no kids. You know,
[22:10.560 --> 22:15.440]  I, I just, I got into this for the love of it. And I don't think I could have done this if I,
[22:15.440 --> 22:19.680]  if I was, you know, somebody that had a family life and couldn't give the dedicate, I'm not
[22:19.680 --> 22:23.360]  saying that you can't do it if you have a family life, but what I'm really saying is you have to
[22:23.360 --> 22:28.640]  be dedicated to it. And my project that matrix, I was literally living it 24 seven. I lived five
[22:28.640 --> 22:33.200]  minutes from that building. And you know, if there's any ever anything wrong, I was there.
[22:33.200 --> 22:37.120]  If there's, you know, whenever the plants need to be fed, I was there. It was there. It was a seven
[22:37.120 --> 22:43.440]  day a week, 365 days a year type of job. And that's how we approached this here at Fleur too.
[22:43.440 --> 22:47.280]  I just have fortunately surrounded myself with other people that are passionate as I,
[22:47.280 --> 22:52.160]  as passionate as I am about this. And so we're all kind of spreading that workload
[22:52.160 --> 22:55.200]  and not having to kill ourselves like I was doing at my previous job.
[22:57.280 --> 23:02.160]  Well said. And as everybody knows, the plants don't know when it's Christmas morning, so
[23:02.160 --> 23:04.080]  we still have to wake up and get things done.
[23:04.800 --> 23:10.880]  That's absolutely right. And you know, with, with living soil, I would say that it's a much
[23:10.880 --> 23:14.800]  easier way of doing things. And just think about it, like you said, you don't have to throw the
[23:14.800 --> 23:20.480]  soil away. It's, it's so much less wasteful to do it this way. We're not throwing anything down
[23:20.480 --> 23:24.080]  the drain. We're not putting fertilizers down the drain. We're not wasting a lot of water.
[23:24.080 --> 23:28.320]  We're not throwing away a bunch of rock wool or a bunch of cocoa at the end of our cycles. You
[23:28.320 --> 23:33.040]  know, this is just, you cut the plants down and plant new plants in it, man. It cuts down on
[23:33.040 --> 23:37.280]  labor so much. And then on top of it, you're not spending all the time, you know, figuring out
[23:37.280 --> 23:42.720]  your pH or EC. It's you're letting the soil do the work for you. It's, it's an amazing way of
[23:42.720 --> 23:46.800]  growing and I can't understand why anybody would want to do it any other way. Everybody's trying
[23:46.800 --> 23:51.360]  to say that you can get better yields out of growing hydroponically. Well, maybe to a certain
[23:51.360 --> 23:56.960]  degree, but I mean, I think we're proving that wrong. It's, it's more about strains, I think,
[23:56.960 --> 24:01.920]  than it is about how you're growing. You know, I love the fact that you leave the root balls in.
[24:01.920 --> 24:07.120]  People just don't understand those root balls are all the nutrients that that. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
[24:07.120 --> 24:11.520]  Yeah. That's, I love that. I love showing that on tours too. Yeah. Nate's going through now. Nate's
[24:11.520 --> 24:16.640]  going to go into the tester room right now. So you're what you're looking at. This is where we
[24:16.640 --> 24:21.600]  do all our phenol hunting. So that that's around the phenol hunting right there in those beds that
[24:21.600 --> 24:28.080]  you're looking at. And then behind that is the first run we did of the Bushido OG and the Katana
[24:28.080 --> 24:38.330]  OG. So that's literally the first run of clones from that. We can't wait to put this one out.
[24:39.290 --> 24:45.050]  What I didn't mention about the Bushido and Katana is they're testing around 4% total terpenes.
[24:46.250 --> 24:53.050]  Wow. So for us, that's good. You know, I've seen some people back in Colorado claiming they're
[24:53.050 --> 24:57.770]  seeing around 6% terpenes. I've never seen that, honestly. So if you guys have a strain that's
[24:57.770 --> 25:02.970]  doing that, let me know about it so I can, so we can hunt for it. You'd have to talk to Mr. Sasquatch
[25:02.970 --> 25:10.410]  503. All right. The Vulcan death grip. Yeah. He was telling us about that. It just oozes out
[25:10.410 --> 25:18.010]  into the jar, how strong it is, the terpene. We did like a dog and pony show for Layton,
[25:18.010 --> 25:23.610]  like showing him the kind of the, what was it like the Chardonnay drip of legs kind of.
[25:23.610 --> 25:28.010]  The legs on the side of a wine glass, except it was inside a sealed jar.
[25:28.730 --> 25:29.530]  There you go.
[25:29.530 --> 25:34.330]  And the top was all sticky when you pull it off. It was amazing. Amazing work.
[25:35.210 --> 25:35.930]  That's awesome.
[25:35.930 --> 25:37.210]  Proof that genetics matter.
[25:38.650 --> 25:39.370]  That's beautiful.
[25:39.370 --> 25:44.890]  Oh, there's more. Hold on. Let me go back in the room. Yeah. So now Nate is in the dry room.
[25:45.450 --> 25:48.410]  Your investors love you boys. How about you get steak dinners?
[25:51.850 --> 25:53.210]  Steak and lobster.
[25:53.210 --> 25:56.970]  Oh yeah. That's gorgeous, boys. Especially on a commercial scale. I mean.
[25:57.850 --> 25:58.330]  Yeah.
[25:58.330 --> 25:59.770]  I'm sure a lot of that is seen.
[25:59.770 --> 26:05.530]  Yeah. We just, what you're looking at with Nate right now is, that is our largest harvest.
[26:06.170 --> 26:12.650]  That is out of a room that's about 6,000 square feet. And we just took it down. It normally takes
[26:12.650 --> 26:18.730]  about four days to take that room down. And that's what you're looking at now. That just was final.
[26:19.530 --> 26:23.290]  Yeah. What did they do two days ago was the last plants taken down in that room.
[26:23.290 --> 26:24.650]  I love the coat hangers.
[26:25.450 --> 26:31.770]  Oh yeah. No, this was a really good setup. They have simple. Yeah. Very effective. Very effective
[26:31.770 --> 26:36.810]  that, you know, we keep these rooms at a nice cool temperature, the humidity around 50%. And
[26:36.810 --> 26:39.930]  we're seeing a nice slow dry down. It's perfect.
[26:39.930 --> 26:42.730]  And what about curing? What is your curing process?
[26:42.730 --> 26:49.210]  So we're going from the dry room straight to buckets. And that goes into our cure room
[26:49.210 --> 26:56.170]  that sits at around 60 degrees. And we're only burping once, I'm sorry, for the first week.
[26:57.050 --> 27:01.370]  So they go in for the first week, burp the buckets maybe for 10 minutes at the most,
[27:01.370 --> 27:05.610]  and then close them up. And then after that, trying to keep them sealed for at least two weeks.
[27:05.610 --> 27:10.570]  You know, the demand here is so high that we don't really get to cure our bud as long as I'd like to.
[27:11.610 --> 27:16.090]  We're just, you know, as soon as it's harvested, it's almost out the door as soon as, you know,
[27:16.090 --> 27:23.210]  as soon as it's cured. So that's a benefit of having, you know, weed that's selling out very
[27:23.210 --> 27:26.650]  fast. But at the same time, that's the one thing where it's like, damn, I wish I could get more of
[27:26.650 --> 27:30.970]  that, you know, another two weeks on the cure. But so we're averaging about two to three weeks
[27:30.970 --> 27:36.490]  on a cure. As Nate is combing through there, I know one of the biggest things that people reach
[27:36.490 --> 27:44.250]  out to us about is how to clone using living soil concepts and ideology and that kind of thing.
[27:44.250 --> 27:48.330]  Can you guys kind of go over partly like what you guys are using to clone? It seems extremely
[27:48.330 --> 27:54.730]  successful. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, what Nate's showing you right there though, Nate was showing
[27:54.730 --> 28:00.250]  us, he's making kashi. We're making our own kashi now, which we try to do compost for a while,
[28:00.250 --> 28:05.930]  but that was attracting way too many flies. So we've decided that Nate's taking it on himself
[28:05.930 --> 28:10.650]  to try and start making his own kashi and it seems to be working really well. So that's what you're
[28:10.650 --> 28:17.770]  looking at there. As far as the clone process, so Sven Blum, you know, Sven Blum, he is our master
[28:17.770 --> 28:24.730]  propagator. He has just been an outstanding cloner and basically it's a very simple process and we're
[28:24.730 --> 28:30.090]  just, you know, it's a simple 90 degree cut and we're using aloe vera as a rooting hormone
[28:30.730 --> 28:36.330]  and then root rye is just peat moss and then some peat moss down below to keep these nice and moist
[28:36.330 --> 28:40.890]  so they don't have to be watered very often. That's really it, just, you know, the simple
[28:40.890 --> 28:45.450]  dome. Yeah, exactly. Will you repeat that for the viewers out there? That's how easy this can be.
[28:45.450 --> 28:50.730]  I feel like a lot of you guys are super over complicating things. Oh yeah, yeah, like, you
[28:50.730 --> 28:55.370]  know, and I've done, so remember I grew, I've grown basically every possible way you can grow this
[28:55.370 --> 28:59.530]  plant and then, you know, we were doing the aquaponics with the, you know, with the misters
[28:59.530 --> 29:05.450]  and all those things and I hate bare roots for one. I want these things to grow into some sort
[29:05.450 --> 29:09.850]  of block and like you said, it's just so simplistic doing this way. You know, it's just, it's very
[29:09.850 --> 29:13.770]  simple. You just stick it in a root block, make sure it stays moist, two weeks you're going to
[29:13.770 --> 29:17.770]  have roots. Look at how healthy some of those right there are. Yeah, they're super healthy.
[29:17.770 --> 29:23.770]  Commercial level, I mean this is textbook ABC. Gotta love those white roots, man. Those are
[29:23.770 --> 29:27.450]  gorgeous. Yeah, and we're seeing about an 80 to 90 percent success rate in our clones.
[29:28.570 --> 29:34.170]  You know, the biggest challenge for us when we were coming in here, so this place doesn't keep
[29:34.170 --> 29:39.610]  moms. We're farming off of plants that are put into the flower room, so the process here is
[29:39.610 --> 29:46.170]  basically three weeks, so a two-week clone stage, three weeks of veg under T5s and then we go
[29:46.170 --> 29:50.170]  another three weeks in the flower rooms to get, you can let them get their roots established,
[29:50.170 --> 29:56.170]  get them get bigger and be under more intense lighting under the high pressure sodium and
[29:56.170 --> 29:59.690]  the week before the flip in the flower is when we'll go in there and take clones.
[30:00.650 --> 30:05.370]  So, if you don't have, you know, mothers, you've got to make sure that those plants are healthy
[30:05.370 --> 30:09.450]  and that was kind of one of the tougher parts of coming in here was when we came in,
[30:09.450 --> 30:15.130]  the plants weren't on work very healthy, so we had to clone off of sick plants to begin with,
[30:15.130 --> 30:20.170]  which you know, which creates a vicious cycle of shit. So, that was one of the first things we had
[30:20.170 --> 30:24.010]  to do was, you know, get the plants healthy enough to where we could start getting healthy cuts and
[30:24.010 --> 30:28.250]  we're there now. Like I said, we're seeing about 80 to 90 percent success rate and it's a very
[30:28.250 --> 30:32.490]  simplistic way of doing it and you know, it works, it works really well and from there,
[30:32.490 --> 30:37.050]  they go into one gallon pots and that's where they'll stay under the T5s for three weeks
[30:37.770 --> 30:42.170]  and then from there, that's when it moves into a flower room and Nate was showing you some of the
[30:42.170 --> 30:46.490]  stuff in those one gallon pots and we're just using rice holes on the top of the one gallon pots
[30:47.130 --> 30:50.330]  and keep it nice and moist, create some aeration, get some nitrogen in there.
[30:50.330 --> 30:53.690]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani Just quickly, Evan, do you see that question on the screen?
[30:53.690 --> 30:55.850]  Evan Brand Shout out to the green goddess.
[30:56.570 --> 30:58.890]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani Okay. What is—I'm sorry, it's really small.
[30:58.890 --> 31:01.450]  Evan Brand Uh, if there's anything you add to the water
[31:01.450 --> 31:04.010]  that they use to soak the clone plugs. Dr. Justin Marchegiani
[31:04.010 --> 31:08.810]  No, it's just aloe vera. It's just, you know, that's all we're using as a rooting hormone is
[31:08.810 --> 31:13.850]  the aloe vera. Dr. Paul What is your water? Are you well? Are you town or—
[31:13.850 --> 31:18.810]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani Oh, God, no. We are city of Las Vegas water. So, we have a—you know,
[31:18.810 --> 31:24.650]  I can—I can go back there and show you that. We have a giant reverse osmosis system that's—we
[31:24.650 --> 31:32.090]  hold about 9,000 gallons of water at any given day. So, Las Vegas' water is notoriously horrible.
[31:32.090 --> 31:36.730]  There's arsenic. Yeah, so Nate's bringing you down there right now. So, that's—those are each
[31:36.730 --> 31:43.290]  a 3,000 gallon tank with a reverse osmosis system put into it. So, like I said, Las Vegas water has
[31:43.290 --> 31:49.130]  all kinds of heavy metals. It even has arsenic in it. It's just nasty shit. So, coming in, it's about
[31:49.130 --> 31:55.130]  700 parts per million, and we're breaking it down to anywhere from zero to about 12 parts per million,
[31:55.130 --> 31:59.530]  or maybe 13. Where are we at now? Oh, 21 parts per million. So, we gotta get that—we gotta get a
[31:59.530 --> 32:02.330]  little service. We're sitting at 21 parts per million right now. It's a little high.
[32:02.330 --> 32:06.650]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani Are you—are you mineralizing it after you've
[32:06.650 --> 32:09.050]  stripped everything? Dr. Justin Marchegiani No. No. Nothing.
[32:09.050 --> 32:12.970]  Just straight RO going right into the beds. Dr. Justin Marchegiani Alright. Just definitely
[32:12.970 --> 32:19.050]  think about this that once you strip that water, if you do not add calcium and magnesium back to it,
[32:19.050 --> 32:22.410]  you may run into issues long-term. You really need to get—
[32:22.410 --> 32:22.810]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani So, Nate—
[32:22.810 --> 32:23.610]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani —the testing done.
[32:23.610 --> 32:25.610]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani Yup. So, we're definitely adding
[32:25.610 --> 32:31.450]  calcium and magnesium and Nate is doing—basically, I'm bringing in—so, my brother and I eat a shit
[32:31.450 --> 32:37.450]  ton of eggs and so we bring our eggshells into work and Nate breaks those down into water-soluble
[32:37.450 --> 32:44.650]  calcium. So, he is adding that to the feeds, but a lot of times, they are feeding straight reverse
[32:44.650 --> 32:48.410]  osmosis and Nate can speak to this a lot more than I can. He's the one actually doing it.
[32:48.970 --> 32:51.450]  Dr. Nate Stockman I don't know if you can hear us right now.
[32:51.450 --> 32:52.730]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani Yeah. I'm here.
[32:52.730 --> 32:54.490]  Dr. Nate Stockman Oh, yeah. There he is. Okay.
[32:54.490 --> 32:59.050]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani So, this is—this is gonna probably send some heads for a spin. It's
[32:59.050 --> 33:04.970]  probably gonna cause a little bit of drama on the message board, too. So, I know the—the
[33:04.970 --> 33:11.450]  dogma around like, you know, your healthy soil makes healthy plants. I've kind of steered away
[33:11.450 --> 33:17.770]  from that in my thought process in the sense of it's more of a symbiosis between the two.
[33:19.130 --> 33:25.210]  And the photosynthetic engine is really the—the energetic process that drives the entire system.
[33:25.210 --> 33:31.370]  All the soil in the—I mean, all the microbiology in the soil gets its energy from photosynthesis.
[33:31.370 --> 33:38.410]  It's really the only process that can bring new energy into an ecosystem. So, we've actually
[33:38.410 --> 33:43.450]  steered away from a lot of soil feeding and we do a lot of foliars as opposed to going through
[33:43.450 --> 33:51.690]  the root system. And I think it's extremely effective with our fermentation stuff that we
[33:51.690 --> 33:59.370]  do use. We do pick a—pick a few tools out of the K&F toolbox. And so, what we do, we just got
[33:59.370 --> 34:06.410]  finished uprooting this around week three. Around week three, I'll collect all this. And if we don't
[34:06.410 --> 34:10.010]  chop it and drop it here on the soil surface, you can kind of see it's a little bit scattered,
[34:10.010 --> 34:19.370]  broken down pretty well. I will collect a lot of this flower heads here and we'll end up
[34:19.370 --> 34:24.810]  fermenting those. And we kind of run somewhat of a three-part system with the ferments as
[34:24.810 --> 34:30.490]  what time we take them from the plant. We'll cut like shoot tips and whatnot off at veg
[34:30.490 --> 34:36.010]  and then ferment those and reapply them at veg. So, at like our apex, we're getting all that
[34:36.010 --> 34:40.490]  synthetic process, the hormone balance, all that stuff that's already in perfect balance for
[34:40.490 --> 34:45.210]  growing cannabis in that stage of the plant. We're trying to reapply it then back to that plant.
[34:45.850 --> 34:53.450]  And in doing so, with proper mineral nutrition, obviously, increasing photosynthesis, I feel like,
[34:54.250 --> 34:58.730]  I mean, I feel like I've seen enough anecdotal evidence to at least make a hypothesis that
[34:59.690 --> 35:05.770]  we've been able to build soil much faster through growing healthy plants than anything
[35:05.770 --> 35:12.970]  that we could really add to the soil. I feel like by going through the leaf system and giving it,
[35:12.970 --> 35:17.610]  I guess, you know, full biomolecules, you're saving energetics that it's pulling from the
[35:17.610 --> 35:23.210]  soil to have to synthesize some of these full aminos and hormones. I mean, oxen for one in
[35:23.210 --> 35:26.810]  the veg system is going to be one that's going to be extremely concentrated in the shoot tip.
[35:27.530 --> 35:32.890]  So, by fermenting that, reapplying it at that time, it's saving energy in the sense of it
[35:32.890 --> 35:37.370]  doesn't have to synthesize more. So, a lot of that photosynthate can then disproportionately
[35:37.370 --> 35:45.370]  go out the root system as root exudates. And root exudates then attract the bacteria. And at a rate
[35:45.370 --> 35:53.370]  that is much faster than I believe you could add things to the soil to increase that microbiology.
[35:53.370 --> 35:58.170]  I feel like it all stems from what's coming out of the roots to attract the correct microorganism.
[35:58.730 --> 36:06.490]  And also what we've seen with the foliars, I guess, is there's not really much competition.
[36:06.490 --> 36:10.090]  Everything's getting a nice even coat. So, you're not really fighting over what's in the soil.
[36:10.650 --> 36:18.250]  And obviously, some testing would go into it. And I can't speak to this from any positivity,
[36:18.250 --> 36:23.690]  but I totally believe that we're almost at a net carbon positive going into the soil from what
[36:23.770 --> 36:31.210]  we're pulling, I mean, from what's going into the plant CO2 wise. And it's just, it's something that
[36:31.210 --> 36:39.290]  we've seen work really well for us. And it's really been able to, on a commercial scale,
[36:39.290 --> 36:45.610]  we save an extreme amount of nutrition as far as these things that we're feeding it.
[36:45.610 --> 36:51.530]  I'm feeding a couple milliliters every time as opposed to half a gallon a room of different
[36:51.530 --> 36:58.730]  inputs when it comes to some of the liquid things that we add. So, it's really just kind of been,
[36:59.610 --> 37:05.370]  it's one of those things that I wouldn't have believed if I didn't see it for myself.
[37:07.450 --> 37:09.850]  If that makes any sense, I've probably not a tangent there.
[37:09.850 --> 37:16.170]  You're talking a lot about feeding plants, plants, and you're spot on. I mean, what you're doing is
[37:16.170 --> 37:20.490]  you're saving a tremendous amount of energy currency within the cells of transferring,
[37:20.490 --> 37:25.450]  like you said, the exudates down, mining the material. Instead, you're taking the plant and
[37:25.450 --> 37:31.450]  at certain time and then reapplying it. It's spot on. It's not anecdotal, it's real.
[37:32.170 --> 37:33.370]  And the evidence is right there.
[37:36.010 --> 37:40.010]  Can we kind of talk more into the IPM and stuff? I noticed you guys are using
[37:40.010 --> 37:42.970]  the predatory mite satchels. Can you kind of go more into that as well?
[37:43.610 --> 37:44.090]  Absolutely.
[37:46.250 --> 37:47.370]  Nate, you want to take that or you want me?
[37:48.250 --> 37:54.970]  Yeah, I could. So, we do just a lot of the two different types of mites we use is the Swarovski
[37:54.970 --> 38:03.930]  mite and the spickle mite. I think it's a californicus would be its technical species name.
[38:04.650 --> 38:11.610]  But outside of that, we've started using, we did the SF nematodes for a while. We apply those
[38:11.610 --> 38:17.370]  foliarly about once a week just for preventative maintenance. You know, in a garden this size,
[38:17.370 --> 38:22.170]  it's an inevitability that you do end up getting some thread pressure here and there. It's pretty
[38:22.170 --> 38:30.970]  regular, but nothing that we haven't been able to fight back really very easily. And so, we use,
[38:31.930 --> 38:38.090]  with the roly-polies, we kind of tried to go into using some different type of soil nematodes to see
[38:38.090 --> 38:46.730]  if that can curb it at any. But as far as the IPM, we're pretty much of the thought process that
[38:46.730 --> 38:52.810]  our health, like kind of immunity, we're really building a good immune system to where nothing is
[38:52.810 --> 39:00.810]  really going to affect them too badly. I do make, the Jadon book has a wetting agent that has gained
[39:00.810 --> 39:08.250]  some popularity as of recently. And then I know there's a, in the traditional KNF methods, they
[39:08.250 --> 39:17.450]  have the OHM, the organic herbal nutrient that is also kind of an antimicrobial kind of antibiotic
[39:17.450 --> 39:26.250]  type application. What I've done here is kind of merge the two. A lot of the materials that goes
[39:26.250 --> 39:31.690]  into making that herbal nutrient, like ginger, garlic, I use hot peppers, actually peppers that
[39:31.690 --> 39:37.930]  we grow. You can see this little pot at the end. We grow peppers here in the garden that we actually
[39:37.930 --> 39:46.010]  use for IPM. And so, I'll boil all that up in a grapeseed oil. I choose grapeseed oil because it's
[39:46.650 --> 39:53.130]  very short to medium chain fatty acids, very, very easy absorption. Transdermally, it works
[39:53.130 --> 39:58.730]  extremely well getting through cell membranes. So, we'll boil up a lot of those herbs and things
[39:58.730 --> 40:05.770]  in the grapeseed oil. And then we pretty much just make soap. It's essentially like our own
[40:05.770 --> 40:10.810]  version of Dr. Bronner's as a wetting agent. And that's pretty much all we use for the IPM. We don't
[40:10.810 --> 40:16.410]  spray any synthetic chemicals, no fungicides, no neem oil, no pesticides like that. It's all
[40:16.410 --> 40:23.210]  biological controls. And then just the wetting agent that's got a few toxic chemicals for some
[40:23.210 --> 40:30.570]  of these bugs. Yeah. And viewers, please hear that out. He just mentioned that he doesn't spray neem
[40:30.570 --> 40:36.010]  oil. There's a lot of info that's still out there on old forums and stuff that people think is gospel.
[40:38.090 --> 40:44.250]  Yeah. We definitely got away from the neem. Yeah. And the caranja. That was being heavily
[40:44.250 --> 40:49.290]  used here. Yeah. We got away from that. That was one of the first moves we did was to get
[40:49.290 --> 40:54.410]  away from the neem and the caranja. Good man. Yeah. That neem oil is a biocide.
[40:57.610 --> 41:00.010]  Leighton, you want to go a little deeper on that for the newer viewers?
[41:02.010 --> 41:07.610]  Yes, sir. Peter, do we dare go there? Absolutely.
[41:08.170 --> 41:16.410]  Yeah. Neem oil has traditionally been a product that's been used in toothpaste,
[41:18.010 --> 41:22.970]  underarm deodorant, and a number of things down in India. And it does have its benefits for sure.
[41:23.610 --> 41:31.290]  But you have to understand that it's definitely a biocide. So it doesn't do well with a really
[41:31.610 --> 41:39.450]  intense biology. So it's an antifungal, antibacterial. It pretty much takes out
[41:40.250 --> 41:46.570]  protozoa. So it's really a biocide in all regards. And it can build up in your soil. So in that
[41:46.570 --> 41:51.130]  regard, if you're trying to do a living soil system, you're taking a risk. You're reducing
[41:51.130 --> 41:57.290]  your populations. And again, in really good living soil, it's all about diversity. So you don't want
[41:57.290 --> 42:03.050]  to lose any of the communities by applying something that could potentially reduce that
[42:03.050 --> 42:11.170]  population. Well said. And it looks like you guys are running the five in each bed?
[42:13.730 --> 42:19.570]  We have kind of been playing around with that. We, kind of depending on size,
[42:20.130 --> 42:26.850]  we've gone up as far as nine. I think we've gone like six, eight, nine, five. We're kind of
[42:26.850 --> 42:31.410]  maximizing seeing where we're at. We start a little smaller to make sure that we don't have
[42:31.410 --> 42:36.450]  any yeast and mold issues there on that kind of when they start overlapping. And then once we see
[42:36.450 --> 42:40.690]  that we're passing a lot of tests, we've kind of been getting a lot more aggressive with how many
[42:40.690 --> 42:45.010]  plants we're putting in here, really try and maximize yield. And Nate, can you flip your
[42:45.010 --> 42:54.210]  phone 90 degrees again? Yeah, I'm sorry. No worry. Amazing. And by the way, I love having two camera
[42:54.210 --> 43:01.810]  operators out in the field right now that I can cut back and forth to. What is your watering?
[43:02.530 --> 43:09.330]  Are you using blue mats or? Oh God, no. What are you doing? We got away from blue mats.
[43:09.330 --> 43:16.930]  It's all hand water. Everything is hand water. Everything is being hand watered in. So they had
[43:16.930 --> 43:23.730]  blue mats in here a while ago and they moved away from that. They saw so many issues with
[43:23.730 --> 43:29.490]  the blue mats. So yeah, those have been gone for quite a while. If you know anybody wants to buy a
[43:29.490 --> 43:38.690]  bunch, we have a bunch for sale. I'm not even joking. So how do you regulate your water? Is it using a
[43:38.690 --> 43:45.730]  moisture meter, hand, touch, what? Nate, well I'd say it's by feel more than anything. But yeah.
[43:45.730 --> 43:51.730]  Yeah, pretty much all touch. I'm gonna, now that I got this clip on my phone, I'm gonna go up and get
[43:51.730 --> 43:58.930]  to go back to our other rooms to get some better shots. But yeah, it's pretty much all by feel.
[43:58.930 --> 44:03.010]  Every morning we'll come through and watch the garden when we get here and we'll spend
[44:03.010 --> 44:07.970]  with the guys. We'll go through about a half hour and kind of walk them through and everyone will
[44:07.970 --> 44:13.250]  get in there, interact with the soil. So we're trying to get as much of our staff as comfortable with
[44:15.090 --> 44:20.450]  kind of, you know, just getting, gauging where it's at. Do you think it needs water? Do you not?
[44:20.450 --> 44:27.250]  The good thing about the Living Soil beds is it's very, very forgiving with over watering and
[44:27.250 --> 44:34.210]  under watering. So there is that big cushion that we do get. But we've kind of tried to steer away
[44:34.210 --> 44:41.170]  from really keeping them soaked and just go for multiple quick waterings more regularly than
[44:41.170 --> 44:46.130]  trying to really soak it down and let it dry down and things like that. So we've gotten a lot more
[44:46.130 --> 44:50.690]  consistent with just how much we're, how frequently we're watering with a lot less water.
[44:52.210 --> 44:59.730]  Turn your phone. Yeah, I'm just waiting for the elevator. I figured this wasn't a critical shot.
[45:02.450 --> 45:05.570]  I'm trying to get in the habit of holding it like that. I'm sitting in a room right now
[45:06.130 --> 45:13.810]  with it. So I'm in our largest room and this is, sorry, this is like I said, 6,000 square feet.
[45:13.810 --> 45:18.690]  This room was just harvested. And what just happened in here was we just added 17 yards of
[45:18.690 --> 45:23.170]  new soil onto the tops. We were depleted pretty heavily in these beds. Some of these beds were
[45:23.170 --> 45:27.650]  down by like three or four inches. But now this is a beautiful site. Every one of these beds,
[45:27.650 --> 45:34.210]  brand new top soil. So that's 60 beds that we just, these guys knocked that out. They knocked
[45:34.210 --> 45:39.490]  it out in the span of like two hours, adding 17 yards of soil up into this room. And it was all
[45:39.490 --> 45:43.890]  the way out in the back of our building, the big pile of soil. We have a great crew here.
[45:43.890 --> 45:46.530]  Also, is it using any medium or using super soil or?
[45:47.570 --> 45:55.810]  So we have a local supplier here that's making a marijuana mix, they call it. And we just add
[45:55.810 --> 46:01.650]  some of our own ingredients to it. We're having them add a little biochar, some rice hulls,
[46:01.650 --> 46:04.850]  and then we just amend it as time goes on.
[46:05.090 --> 46:10.930]  Well, we'll definitely have to have a talk after this about chemistry testing and biological
[46:10.930 --> 46:16.850]  testing. That's the one thing that you can get caught off guard if you're not paying attention
[46:16.850 --> 46:25.410]  to it. It's something we definitely want to do more of. When we got, when this team came together,
[46:25.410 --> 46:32.130]  we kind of had, we were just trying to get them back in the black pretty much. So it was
[46:32.210 --> 46:37.330]  a lot of business focus and turning that stuff around. And now that we've kind of seen some
[46:37.330 --> 46:42.530]  stability, we really want to dive into a lot more frequently doing soil tests, sap tests,
[46:42.530 --> 46:49.410]  and really just kind of see throughout a cycle what our plants are taking up and how much of it.
[46:49.410 --> 46:53.490]  And it's really, I think we're getting to that point where we can really start fine tuning with
[46:53.490 --> 46:57.490]  some of the biological testing and chemical testing for sure.
[46:57.490 --> 47:02.770]  Yeah. It's interesting that a lot of cultivars pull different things and that's why it's so
[47:02.770 --> 47:07.730]  important to do a test after the run. Because if you have two cultivars that are pulling some of
[47:07.730 --> 47:13.650]  the same nutrients, you can get deficient pretty darn quick after the next run. So I'm glad you
[47:13.650 --> 47:16.130]  guys are keeping focused on that. I think it's really important.
[47:16.850 --> 47:21.010]  And someone asked earlier what you're pumping through those big industrial
[47:21.730 --> 47:25.810]  That is just pure RO water. Correct. Those are ultrasonic humidifiers.
[47:27.810 --> 47:32.610]  And so, yeah. And that's what I was talking about with the cloning earlier. The only thing that we've
[47:32.610 --> 47:38.210]  experienced as far as negativity was, and now we've conquered that, was the step down of humidity.
[47:38.210 --> 47:44.210]  We were going from the 90%, 80% domes down into when it's a little bit cooler.
[47:44.210 --> 47:46.210]  And so we're going to be pumping through that.
[47:46.370 --> 47:51.810]  We're going from the 90%, 80% domes down into when they would go into the beds,
[47:51.810 --> 47:56.130]  they didn't have humidifiers in there and they're stepping down to like 35, 45% and you'd see stunt.
[47:56.850 --> 48:00.370]  The plants would just stunt. And so we've added a lot of humidity into these rooms.
[48:01.330 --> 48:04.690]  And that's working really, really well. These humidifiers.
[48:05.970 --> 48:07.250]  Are you following VPD?
[48:09.650 --> 48:12.450]  As much as I can. Yes. Yes, definitely.
[48:13.330 --> 48:17.970]  You know, I had an interesting conversation with a friend of mine that is very much into it. And
[48:17.970 --> 48:24.450]  he's like, you know, I only pay attention to VPD during veg and at flower, I start to just let
[48:24.450 --> 48:30.850]  things go where they go. And he's found that some of these plants really like it out of the range.
[48:31.890 --> 48:36.050]  Produce more. And again, it's knowing your plan and paying attention to its reaction.
[48:36.690 --> 48:40.610]  But just keep in mind, it might be a good tip that, you know, some of these, again,
[48:40.610 --> 48:44.210]  some of these cultivars do not like that to finish at that level.
[48:46.610 --> 48:52.450]  For us, it's more about, and in my experience now in this market, it's more about passing the mold
[48:52.450 --> 48:58.050]  and yeast test than it is about what the plants want at that stage. If we're running around a 60%
[48:58.050 --> 49:05.410]  relative humidity in late stage flower, let's say week eight or nine, we're going to end up seeing
[49:05.410 --> 49:10.130]  some Botrytis failures. At least that's been my experience in the past. Fortunately, we have not
[49:10.130 --> 49:15.170]  seen that here and Nate swears we won't. But, you know, I don't like to take the chance of leaving
[49:15.170 --> 49:19.890]  that humidity range too high when we're up in, you know, week, like week seven, week eight, week nine.
[49:19.890 --> 49:25.330]  We're trying to shoot for around a 50% range in those weeks. But yeah, like you said, in early
[49:25.330 --> 49:31.410]  veg stage, it is important to follow it. And we try to as much as possible. It's really hard to
[49:31.410 --> 49:39.650]  control the humidity at night. So we will see some spikes at nighttime in the rooms. So we're trying
[49:39.650 --> 49:43.810]  to, you know, get control of that a little bit more. And that's just, you know, as much supplemental
[49:43.810 --> 49:48.210]  dehumidification you seem to be putting into these buildings, it never seems to be enough for
[49:48.210 --> 49:54.130]  nighttime. And so we're rolling in a bunch of humid, dehumidifiers in these rooms in late stages,
[49:54.130 --> 49:58.370]  just to bring that humidity down. So that's one of the challenges you face when doing this on a
[49:58.370 --> 50:03.250]  commercial scale, you know, especially with this amount of living soil and those plants putting
[50:03.250 --> 50:07.730]  off all that moisture in the air is the nighttime, how are you controlling your humidity levels?
[50:08.050 --> 50:09.090]  It's always a challenge.
[50:11.890 --> 50:13.970]  What's your labour force managing all this?
[50:15.330 --> 50:17.090]  It's not nearly as much as you would think.
[50:18.290 --> 50:23.010]  Yeah. So I'm bringing it up. I want people to realise that, you know, you're even mentioning
[50:23.010 --> 50:28.130]  that you're hand watering. So to some people, it's like, it sounds like way too much labour.
[50:28.130 --> 50:33.730]  No, we have seven growers. Seven, that's it. 30,000 square feet, seven growers. Remember,
[50:34.610 --> 50:40.690]  honestly, it's less labour intensive than other style of growing. Like I said, just at the end,
[50:40.690 --> 50:44.850]  where you have to throw away all of that soil or rockwool and in the beginning, where you're
[50:44.850 --> 50:49.330]  planting in all of it and filling pots and doing all that work, man, it's a shit tonne of work.
[50:50.130 --> 50:57.010]  So I would argue that growing organically is less of a labour force, not more. And then however many
[50:57.010 --> 51:01.250]  trimmers I need just depends on how much weight we're producing for a month. Right now I'm running
[51:01.250 --> 51:07.010]  with probably about 10 trimmers. Packaging is our biggest challenge at this point because we're
[51:07.730 --> 51:12.210]  fortunate enough to be selling out everything that we're growing and it's selling before it's
[51:12.210 --> 51:17.490]  even coming down most of the time. So we need to get it packaged and out the door. So I have a lot
[51:17.490 --> 51:22.930]  more packagers than I do growers, a lot more. The packaging staff is probably sitting at around,
[51:23.730 --> 51:30.290]  oh gosh, I want to say at least eight to 10 guys. And I'm going to give a shout out to Louise
[51:30.290 --> 51:33.170]  because he asked me to give him a shout out. So there's a shout out to Louise.
[51:34.370 --> 51:40.690]  Go on. And just quickly speaking of shout outs, I'd like to give a shout out to my
[51:41.890 --> 51:50.050]  90 year old dad and his much younger 84 year old wife, Inga, who are tuning in from Narragansett,
[51:50.050 --> 51:59.250]  Rhode Island right now. That's awesome. That's awesome. Oh, by the way, I'm not a landscaper,
[51:59.250 --> 52:03.570]  dude. I'm a soil biologist and soil engineer. I've never laid my life.
[52:05.810 --> 52:10.450]  Real quick to you guys, we're talking about some IPM stuff. Here's something else we use,
[52:10.450 --> 52:16.850]  the concumerous mite. Yeah, this sucker. Yeah. Yeah. This one is a great mite. It's super
[52:16.850 --> 52:24.050]  aggressive. I'll say a little funny story about this mite. So when we introduced this to the
[52:24.050 --> 52:29.490]  garden, all of a sudden we started seeing these little black specks show up on our yellow sticky
[52:29.490 --> 52:33.810]  traps. And we're like, what the hell is it? It turns out we had cigarette beetles in the soil,
[52:33.810 --> 52:39.970]  and we didn't even know they were there. But the cucumbers basically chased them out of our soil.
[52:41.250 --> 52:45.250]  They just, I guess they sensed that problem in there. And there it was like a mass exodus of
[52:45.250 --> 52:51.010]  these drugs. I'm sorry, drugstore beetles, what they're called. And they're not harmful or anything,
[52:51.010 --> 52:55.250]  but it was just funny to see that the cucumber is going into that soil, disrupting the life cycle
[52:55.250 --> 53:01.010]  of these things. And now we don't see those beetles anymore. Now, it's interesting. You
[53:01.010 --> 53:06.290]  guys don't really go, it doesn't seem like you go heavy on the cover crop at any time in the grow.
[53:06.290 --> 53:13.250]  Is that just the soil's normal or newer? I mean, it's something we've been working on. So we had,
[53:13.250 --> 53:18.770]  when we first came in, we went really heavy on the cover crop. We were going with, we had all
[53:18.770 --> 53:25.010]  kinds of stuff growing. And then we started seeing some issues just like the peas, for example,
[53:25.010 --> 53:30.610]  were just getting too big, strangling plants. Just things were overpowering our cannabis plants.
[53:30.610 --> 53:37.410]  They were just getting too tall. And then we had a lot of, oh, shit. So collard greens, we had some
[53:37.410 --> 53:41.890]  collard greens on the bottom and they were just getting just way too massive. And so we kind of
[53:41.890 --> 53:47.570]  scaled back on the cover crop and tried to figure out something else to use. And that's something
[53:47.570 --> 53:51.650]  we've been working on. So there is some rooms with some cover crop in them that Nate's been
[53:51.650 --> 53:56.530]  working on, but we just haven't really seen much success yet with the seeds that we've been buying
[53:56.530 --> 54:00.930]  for our cover crop. So it's something we are definitely working on. And again, that's, you know,
[54:00.930 --> 54:06.450]  for the roly polies, that's good roly poly food. You know, it's good worm food. We need to be adding
[54:06.450 --> 54:09.730]  cover crops. So it's definitely something that we're talking about constantly and working on.
[54:09.730 --> 54:13.090]  So with the isopods, I don't know if this is, okay.
[54:13.090 --> 54:13.650]  Go ahead, Nate.
[54:13.730 --> 54:17.970]  Oh, I was just going to say, as far as cover crops go, I think it's like,
[54:19.890 --> 54:24.290]  when we did have one earlier, I feel like it served its purpose. It's like when we kind of
[54:24.290 --> 54:29.810]  got here, we had some depleted soil and it really probably helped add a lot of organic matter back
[54:29.810 --> 54:36.050]  into the soil. But it's kind of the symbiosis now that we're playing around with to see which ones
[54:36.050 --> 54:40.690]  work well together and for cannabis, you know, maybe some low growers that still supply some
[54:40.690 --> 54:47.490]  of this nutrition to the soil. I think it's very doable. It just, I just think it's a million ways
[54:47.490 --> 54:52.450]  to skin a cat. It just, I think there's a use for it and we got a use out of what we needed it for
[54:52.450 --> 54:58.450]  at the time being, but it's kind of, we're seeing a lot of success right now. So it just kind of
[54:58.450 --> 55:05.330]  like why stick a spoke in the wheel? Sure. I love the fact you're keeping everything
[55:05.330 --> 55:10.370]  paid up. That's really important to maintain that moisture so it doesn't go hydrophobic on the top.
[55:10.450 --> 55:14.290]  Which is always a problem with those super soils. So well done.
[55:15.330 --> 55:19.410]  And I feel like we all agree that like in flower, we want to make sure that we're not doing a cover
[55:19.410 --> 55:25.010]  crop. So again, this is how like a chef cooks their own own dish. You know, there's a variety
[55:25.010 --> 55:30.210]  of different ways. But again, as we started this show, I want the viewers to remember that like,
[55:30.210 --> 55:35.090]  we need to remember that we should start really talking to people when they can show their plants
[55:35.090 --> 55:39.890]  like this. There's a lot of philosophy that seems to be flying out there, but how many people are
[55:39.890 --> 55:44.610]  day in day out being able to grow cannabis like this, especially at scale. So hats off to you,
[55:44.610 --> 55:49.330]  again, to you, Nate, and hats off to you, Evan, for taking this to the next level, bro.
[55:50.210 --> 55:54.690]  There's not a lot of people that are rocking it like this consistently. We can tell this is
[55:54.690 --> 56:00.130]  obviously an extremely successful perpetual harvest, which is what everybody on the team would want.
[56:02.770 --> 56:07.730]  Yep. That's something we are, we are taking down plants literally every two weeks.
[56:10.530 --> 56:14.130]  So how much weight are you actually moving out of the door?
[56:15.330 --> 56:19.490]  The target right now is a minimum of 200 a month, 200 pounds a month.
[56:19.490 --> 56:19.990]  Jesus.
[56:21.890 --> 56:27.650]  Yeah, so I'm shooting for 300 pounds a month. And we're gonna get there. We're gonna get there. It's
[56:27.650 --> 56:32.130]  just, you know, it's, it's getting new genetics in the building. You know, we just had to slowly,
[56:32.130 --> 56:37.650]  but surely move in some more stuff that's gonna yield better for us. We had a lot of plants in
[56:37.650 --> 56:43.970]  this facility early on that were just super small and bad yielders. So yeah, but we're getting there.
[56:43.970 --> 56:47.570]  We're definitely getting there. And you know, what you're talking about earlier, by the way,
[56:47.570 --> 56:52.530]  I'm kind of proud of that hay layer on top, man, that was a bitch to find. You know, we were like,
[56:52.530 --> 56:56.210]  yeah, let's throw hay on top. And then we said, Oh, shit, but wait a minute, it has to be organic.
[56:56.210 --> 56:56.710]  Yeah.
[56:56.710 --> 57:01.970]  And I learned pretty quickly that people don't give a shit what they feed their horses. There,
[57:01.970 --> 57:06.690]  you know, there's very little organic hay out there on the market. So we were able to,
[57:06.690 --> 57:11.250]  we were able to find a company that's making organic alfalfa. And we're shipping that in,
[57:11.250 --> 57:14.130]  you know, every month. But that took a long time to find.
[57:14.130 --> 57:18.770]  That's awesome. Yeah, you're right about the horses, man. It's horrifying to think what,
[57:18.770 --> 57:20.690]  you know, a lot of these people are feeding them.
[57:20.690 --> 57:23.490]  All GMO hay.
[57:23.490 --> 57:25.570]  Yeah, literally. And grain.
[57:25.570 --> 57:26.850]  Literally. Yep.
[57:27.490 --> 57:30.770]  And then Nate, are you using that because as that's breaking down,
[57:30.770 --> 57:33.570]  obviously, there's going to be more fungal activity going on.
[57:33.650 --> 57:42.920]  I guess I don't follow the question. Like what, as far as what breaking down fungal activity,
[57:42.920 --> 57:44.760]  I'm kind of lost on the question.
[57:45.560 --> 57:49.480]  Okay, so I've tried to experiment more. And, you know, again, these are just experiments,
[57:49.480 --> 57:54.440]  but it seems like when I have added the hay or grasses, that kind of stuff, as that starts to
[57:54.440 --> 57:59.320]  break down, there's, there starts to be little mushrooms that start to pop up over time.
[57:59.480 --> 58:07.960]  We have seen a lot of mushrooms here and there sporadically. And I am under the impression that
[58:07.960 --> 58:16.280]  it comes from a different source. I believe that fungal activity in the soil is a direct response
[58:16.280 --> 58:22.760]  to lipid production. When plants are really healthy and start photosynthesizing at a very
[58:22.760 --> 58:28.680]  incredible rate, the rate of fungal activity is so much higher than when they're just growing
[58:28.840 --> 58:37.320]  the rate of production goes up significantly. And once they start being able to pretty much
[58:37.320 --> 58:41.640]  they're supplying all the root exudates they need all the bacteria is happy in the soil,
[58:41.640 --> 58:47.320]  they're going to start storing excess energy in plant fats and lipids. And when those start
[58:47.320 --> 58:54.120]  going out of the soil, the only thing biologically that can break down fats is fungus. And so as you
[58:54.120 --> 58:58.760]  increase your lipid production of your plants, you're going to buy response, increase your
[58:58.760 --> 59:05.880]  fungal activity in the soil. And again, that comes from the same top of the concept of growing
[59:05.880 --> 59:12.520]  healthy plants, then will make a increase your soil fertility at a very exponential rate.
[59:15.670 --> 59:20.870]  Right on. Yeah. And I think that they also, the fungals are really important for breaking down
[59:20.870 --> 59:26.630]  the lignin. So all of those root balls, they're going to get chewed up by that fungally dominant
[59:26.630 --> 59:32.390]  soil, which is important. Again, nutrient cycling right back for the plant, less work for the plant.
[59:32.390 --> 59:36.630]  You guys are doing a great job. I would love to clarify one thing. There's a big difference
[59:36.630 --> 59:43.350]  between straw and hay. Straw is brown. It's brittle. Hay tends to be a little bit softer
[59:44.150 --> 59:49.350]  and green. So it has a higher nitrogen content. So just keep that in mind. If you're feeding
[59:49.350 --> 59:57.980]  fungally, you want to use straw, not hay. I believe what we're using is alfalfa hay.
[59:57.980 --> 01:00:02.540]  So we are using hay. It does come a little green when it is compressed in the bales.
[01:00:03.340 --> 01:00:10.540]  And yeah, so it does come out a little green when we do. But again, we also, we shred all of our
[01:00:11.980 --> 01:00:16.620]  stem waste. None of it goes to the trash. We have a wood chipper out back that will shred all of it.
[01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:23.500]  So we'll reintroduce that on this mixed up and reintroduce that as more of a hard matter,
[01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:30.380]  complex carbohydrate food, I guess. So there is a mix between the two.
[01:00:31.180 --> 01:00:36.620]  But again, yeah, it is more hay heavy for sure. Well, that's fine. You're getting nitrogen from
[01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:42.300]  it. So you are getting some of the benefits of as it dries out becoming more fungally food,
[01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:47.740]  but out of the gate, you're getting a nitrogen pump. So that's probably a win-win right there.
[01:00:53.910 --> 01:00:57.990]  So what's next for you guys moving forward? Are you going to continue? You mentioned that you
[01:00:57.990 --> 01:01:03.510]  had a pheno hunt room. Are you doing like, I feel like kind of the standard 100 seeds?
[01:01:03.510 --> 01:01:09.190]  Are you running more than that? No, we're limited on the space in there. So normally,
[01:01:09.190 --> 01:01:15.430]  it's right. I would imagine around 60 to 75 popped originally. But we're not, you know,
[01:01:15.430 --> 01:01:21.990]  we're not doing giant pheno hunts. This is a room that has four by eight beds. So it doesn't give us
[01:01:21.990 --> 01:01:26.630]  the ability to, you know, hunt too much. And then also, I don't want to make Sven's life completely
[01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:31.750]  miserable where he's having to track all these clones constantly that off of the pheno hunts.
[01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:37.030]  Remember, you have to back them up. And you know, we have to track all that stuff. And also,
[01:01:37.030 --> 01:01:40.790]  there's the whole seed to sale aspect of all this. So it creates a lot of work. Pheno hunting creates
[01:01:40.790 --> 01:01:45.990]  a lot of work. And you know, when you're talking about the day to day operation, and we are running
[01:01:45.990 --> 01:01:50.230]  this with only seven guys, but those seven guys are pretty doggone busy every day. So we're not
[01:01:50.230 --> 01:01:55.590]  trying to kill them with the amount of work we're putting on them. So yeah, like I said, 60 to 75
[01:01:55.590 --> 01:02:03.590]  usually is the popping average. You guys haven't dialed in. I mean, that's what I really appreciate.
[01:02:04.550 --> 01:02:10.070]  You're asking like what's next for us is. So we're, I mean, as far as pheno hunting goes,
[01:02:10.070 --> 01:02:16.870]  we are in, we don't have many Indica's in house right now. So that's the pheno hunt right now is
[01:02:16.870 --> 01:02:20.630]  concentrating a lot of strains that we feel are going to be heavy in Mersenne and, you know,
[01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:28.150]  Indica dominant strains. And that's really it, you know, as far as what's next, we're always looking
[01:02:28.230 --> 01:02:34.950]  to expand and do this elsewhere. I think that we're trying to create a cookie cutter model that
[01:02:34.950 --> 01:02:40.310]  can be franchised out or that we can consult on. And now, so that's kind of our next step is to
[01:02:40.310 --> 01:02:44.070]  kind of try and take this nationally. I'm sure that's what you guys are looking to do too.
[01:02:47.910 --> 01:02:51.510]  So let's talk a little bit about, I mean, for lighting, especially at the level that you guys
[01:02:51.510 --> 01:02:57.350]  are at, do you change any of that on 12-12? Do you kind of do like, you know, manipulate some of that
[01:02:57.350 --> 01:03:02.870]  lighting structure to have an extra hour where the lights aren't on? We've played a little bit
[01:03:02.870 --> 01:03:08.390]  with going darker, a little bit longer at the end. But now normally we've just stuck with this simple
[01:03:08.390 --> 01:03:13.670]  12-12 schedule, 12-12 schedule. Haven't really messed with lights. I haven't really messed with
[01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:17.590]  temperature or anything, trying to get perps out or anything like that. You know, we're pretty
[01:03:17.590 --> 01:03:23.110]  standard. Everything we're doing is working. So, you know, I don't want to try, if like I said,
[01:03:23.110 --> 01:03:28.630]  if it ain't broke, don't fix it. So everything is working. So we're just keeping it like that.
[01:03:28.630 --> 01:03:33.830]  Whatever tweaks we make are very subtle, you know. So one thing I have learned commercially
[01:03:33.830 --> 01:03:37.910]  is that you don't want to make sweeping changes when you make a bunch of changes at once and then
[01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:41.830]  you start seeing issues while it's even on a small scale. Where the hell are you going wrong?
[01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:51.910]  So any changes we make are very slow and steady. Well said. Thank you. Thank you, Jerry.
[01:03:54.070 --> 01:04:03.190]  Yeah, as you can see, I'm in what room? We call this 2A. So this room is another,
[01:04:03.190 --> 01:04:08.950]  we're still a month away from harvesting this room. This is looking really good. This is one
[01:04:08.950 --> 01:04:15.510]  of the upstairs rooms, all in four by eight beds. Definitely stacking up nice for sure. Oh yeah,
[01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:24.070]  big time. Are you bringing any clones in yourself? No, well, no. The majority of what we've done
[01:04:24.070 --> 01:04:30.950]  has been all from seed. We have brought one clone in since we've started here. And, you know, this
[01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:36.950]  just has to be from a really trusted source. And, you know, we do our due diligence with any clone
[01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:40.790]  that comes in here. Like I said, only one has come in so far. So we quarantine that, make sure that
[01:04:40.790 --> 01:04:44.630]  there's no issues with it. And then we pop that in the garden. So the one clone we brought into
[01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:49.350]  this building is a strain called Wookiees and Cream. And again, that was a breeding project
[01:04:49.350 --> 01:04:56.870]  by Sven that he had outside of the facility that we just brought back in. Interesting. Yeah. Glad
[01:04:56.870 --> 01:05:02.950]  to hear about the biosecurity. I think that most people are missing that. You know, I've seen enough
[01:05:02.950 --> 01:05:07.030]  in this industry, especially commercially to know that, you know, I mean, I've seen enough of my home
[01:05:07.030 --> 01:05:12.630]  grows, but shit, you end up with a problem, man, it grow like this. And, you know, that's a tough
[01:05:12.630 --> 01:05:17.750]  task to tackle. Oh yeah. Shit gets out of control real quick. Very, very quickly. Very quickly,
[01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:21.910]  you know, and so our, our IPM, I think is second to none, you know, and anybody coming to this
[01:05:21.910 --> 01:05:25.350]  building, we're suiting them up. We do not take any of that lightly at all, even though that we,
[01:05:25.350 --> 01:05:30.790]  you know, we have such a colony now of all these predator mites and bugs, but we don't take any
[01:05:30.790 --> 01:05:36.550]  chances whatsoever. Always being proactive. That's definitely the motto. Absolutely. No, you never
[01:05:36.550 --> 01:05:40.070]  want to be reacting to a problem. You always want to be out in front of it. That's my philosophy
[01:05:40.150 --> 01:05:47.750]  with this, especially with growing. Can you guys talk a little bit about your foliar feeding,
[01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:52.230]  kind of what you're feeding at different stages of growth and your application rate?
[01:05:53.590 --> 01:06:03.990]  That's definitely Nate. So we do like a traditional veg feed. Mineral wise, we try and do a lot of the,
[01:06:03.990 --> 01:06:12.950]  like the raw mineral nutrition through the soil. A lot of the foliar aspect of the, my
[01:06:12.950 --> 01:06:19.910]  thought process behind it is the biomolecules that we're getting from our ferments. And so in the,
[01:06:19.910 --> 01:06:26.950]  the veg stage we do, like I said, in the shoot tips, this one we've just flipped, but right when
[01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:34.550]  we prune our plants at the flip, I will collect a lot of these shoot tips. And so that's like the,
[01:06:34.550 --> 01:06:39.990]  the ferment that comes from this right here. I always liken it to like a sprouted seed tea
[01:06:41.910 --> 01:06:49.430]  is what I'll use a veg. And again, that's more the thought process that I have behind it is more of a
[01:06:50.390 --> 01:06:56.630]  hormonal and biomolecule thing than a full on mineral nutrition. We do use consistent
[01:06:57.270 --> 01:07:03.430]  coconut, the dehydrated coconut, aloe vera powder. And we started using a little bit of
[01:07:04.870 --> 01:07:12.950]  some raw fish hydrosylate in the early stages of veg, just to give it a nice nitrogen boost. And
[01:07:13.910 --> 01:07:20.310]  we do pretty limited application rates. I do use a little humic acid just kind of as like a
[01:07:20.310 --> 01:07:30.630]  key later to kind of, you know, bioactivator really. So the, we do not really do any individual
[01:07:30.630 --> 01:07:37.670]  ingredient more than about one to a thousand rate. So, and generally about two times a week.
[01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:43.590]  So it'll be pretty light. I would imagine probably with the full concentration of the
[01:07:44.150 --> 01:07:52.150]  the feed at any given time is probably one to 500 around and probably about two times a week,
[01:07:52.150 --> 01:08:00.870]  as I said, and try and go more frequently and less dilute just to kind of maintain their,
[01:08:01.990 --> 01:08:06.310]  just kind of keep that engine rolling, I guess. So they're never really needing anything.
[01:08:06.310 --> 01:08:10.870]  And we're not really burning them with too much. And then we'll just kind of,
[01:08:10.870 --> 01:08:13.510]  we'll just kind of go with the flow. And then we'll just kind of go with the flow.
[01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:21.270]  As we progress into the transition time, I kind of overlap the veg, because I know during that
[01:08:21.270 --> 01:08:24.950]  stretch, there's still going to be a lot of nitrogen and whatnot needed. So as those take
[01:08:24.950 --> 01:08:31.030]  off, we still kind of supplement a little bit of the, we'll still throw some aloe vera, coconut,
[01:08:31.030 --> 01:08:36.390]  we use pretty much all the way through. The aloe vera will cut off around week two,
[01:08:37.270 --> 01:08:44.070]  in after the flip, and we start supplementing a little bit more of our ferments that have been
[01:08:44.070 --> 01:08:50.870]  made kind of later stages. So all those little creamy buds and whatnot, all those active enzymes
[01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:55.510]  and whatnot that are going on in there. That's the next ferment we start applying for when we start
[01:08:55.510 --> 01:09:02.790]  seeing buds start to set. And so the whole idea of it is just to kind of give them exactly what
[01:09:02.790 --> 01:09:08.150]  they need and what they're producing at the time that they're producing it. And that way,
[01:09:08.150 --> 01:09:12.870]  we're saving energy here, they don't have to pull things up to the roots. And then a lot of our
[01:09:13.830 --> 01:09:18.230]  photosynthate that's going on here is then being pushed back into the soil.
[01:09:18.230 --> 01:09:25.910]  So the only time we actually feed through the root ball and through the soil is going to be
[01:09:26.630 --> 01:09:33.510]  week four through six. We do a little bit of, once fruits are setting, calcium is very important,
[01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:39.830]  really, really important mineral for the fruit development. So we start going a little heavier
[01:09:39.830 --> 01:09:47.670]  on the calcium. All the way through, we do on the foliar aspects, I should have mentioned this
[01:09:47.670 --> 01:09:53.590]  earlier, but we do a little bit of lactobacillus on all of our foliars. I think it's also a reason
[01:09:53.590 --> 01:10:03.030]  why we have such success in our IPM, because it is most of the bacterial species that they
[01:10:03.030 --> 01:10:10.150]  test for here are all gram negative bacteria. And the lactobacillus family is pretty gram positive.
[01:10:10.950 --> 01:10:15.670]  And it's very competitive. So anything that's going to be around the flowers is pretty much
[01:10:15.670 --> 01:10:20.870]  going to be, we use that as kind of like a keeper bacteria, almost our guard bacteria.
[01:10:21.510 --> 01:10:26.950]  It seems to work very well. But and then back to when we feed the soil, it's pretty much we use
[01:10:26.950 --> 01:10:33.750]  like a fruit juice, a fruit ferment to really get like the enzymes and whatnot for mature fruiting.
[01:10:33.750 --> 01:10:42.070]  We use a little bit of coconut there. And also, yeah, just heavier on the calcium at that point.
[01:10:42.070 --> 01:10:46.550]  We actually feed pretty simply from week three, four, I mean, excuse me, four, five and six,
[01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:53.590]  it's very, very light. And we kind of just let the plant eat what it's taking up in the veg time,
[01:10:53.590 --> 01:10:57.670]  you know, with these seasonal plants, it's like, that's part of their biology, they store, store,
[01:10:57.670 --> 01:11:03.910]  store. So when they flower, they eat up everything they have. And it's something that I feel like
[01:11:03.910 --> 01:11:09.830]  your smoke is much, much cleaner, much more tasty when you are able to kind of wean it off and give
[01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:16.390]  it a lot of water towards the end of the cycle. And so yeah, that's kind of how we tackle that
[01:11:16.390 --> 01:11:23.520]  when it comes to our feeding. And are you guys spraying that humidity? I mean, obviously,
[01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:28.160]  you're in the desert there. Is that a 24 hour thing? Is that 12 hours when the lights are on?
[01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:35.520]  We do that pretty much when the lights are on. Right on. We have them all on timer. So when the
[01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:40.240]  lights go off, they'll shut off. And we got like, as you can see up here in the ceiling, we got a
[01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:47.120]  couple of these sub cools. So our building engineer has come in here and got all these set
[01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:52.880]  up to where it's like once one thing gets out of range, one of these sub cools will kick on and
[01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:57.680]  start like kind of dehumidifying without the dehumidifier. So he's got it all tweaked out to
[01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:03.440]  where these things are on for a certain amount of time and other things will pop on and off as
[01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:11.200]  we go out of the range that we set. Just quickly, we have a very demanding audience
[01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:15.760]  that's asking for slower and steadier camera panning and movement.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:22.400]  Spoiled. I think we're all getting drunk out here.
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:26.640]  Tough crowd. This is hard to do, guys. We're sitting here with our arms sitting,
[01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:29.760]  you know, it's tough on your shoulders. I've been there many times.
[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:38.800]  We'll do our best, though. So when you guys came to this new facility,
[01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:42.960]  you know, you guys kind of mentioned that there were some issues. Do you guys have any idea what
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:50.160]  pounds they were hitting per month and stuff like that? Yeah, before we came on, they were
[01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:54.960]  roughly around 100 pounds a month. So you've doubled the production plus probably brought
[01:12:54.960 --> 01:13:00.320]  down and your quality's been through the roof, I would imagine. Yeah, that was the other thing. I
[01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:05.280]  would say the way they were curing, they had some issues there. In my opinion, you know,
[01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:10.720]  they were burping the buckets every single day, no matter how long the buckets were in the rooms.
[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:15.440]  Even if they were in there a month, they were getting burped. So that, you know, a lot of the
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:19.680]  weed was getting really dried out, didn't really have much of a nose on it. And like I say, you
[01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:24.720]  know, we've also moved in a lot of new genetics in here, too. So that's made a big difference as
[01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:30.400]  well in the end. Yeah, it seems like you guys really brought that shit back to extreme
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:36.160]  profitability there. And you guys are running just a beautiful growth. Just a clarification
[01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:43.840]  question from the audience. The new shoots, are you just soaking them in water? No, I actually...
[01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:51.440]  As far as the extraction method, like how we get the... how we make it a liquid,
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:57.760]  is that what they're asking? Yep. Okay. So what we'll do is just get a lot of dry,
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:14:05.520]  I mean, well, not dry, but like I said, the prune. So we pretty much get pieces like this.
[01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:11.360]  And we'll, I'll go through and pick off the little shoot tips, if I really want to concentrate a lot
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:19.280]  of that. I would say all those the biomolecules and those synthetic areas, the meristems, I guess,
[01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:27.200]  would be the biological term to use. So then I'll mix it all up and with equal parts brown sugar.
[01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:35.200]  And I use brown sugar because I know, I think you guys have had Chris Trump on before, and he's
[01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:43.360]  been a pioneer in kind of this whole fermentation, K&F, kind of bringing it to America. He's really
[01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:47.440]  one of the originals that I know that was really promoting these growth styles. And
[01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:56.000]  from what I've learned from him was that the sugar actually creates a much stronger osmotic pull
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:00.800]  than you can get with molasses or anything like that. So pretty much equal parts sugar
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:08.480]  as plant mass. And then I'll always throw a little bit of lab bacteria in there, just kind of as a
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:15.920]  fermentation inoculum, kind of. And so it's very simple, equal parts plant matter, brown sugar,
[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:21.760]  a touch of lab, and cover it up and let it sit for about 10 days. And you've got a whole bucket
[01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:30.480]  full of very rich fertilizer. And we call that a gold nugget on this show, sir. Appreciate that.
[01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:38.640]  And that you spray at 500 to 1, correct? Yeah. So it's about, depending on the stage,
[01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:45.440]  a lot of it stays very similar. I do, for the most part, coconut, calcium,
[01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:54.240]  and humic acid are pretty much throughout the entire thing. Aloe vera starts early,
[01:15:54.240 --> 01:16:00.720]  depending on the ferment, the time of the growth is what the ferment's going to be. And I don't
[01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:09.920]  use, so about six, I use about six tablespoons of total feed in five gallons. So let me see here,
[01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:18.240]  615. It's looking at, it's about 75 milliliters to 2000 milliliters. I mean, 20,000, excuse me. I
[01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:26.880]  believe 20 liters is about five gallons. So I'm using about 75 to 100, maybe 150 mLs to
[01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:32.080]  20,000 mLs. So very, very lightly concentrated.
[01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:36.880]  And that puts the polish on that nugget Bri was talking about.
[01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:42.800]  Absolutely, man. You guys, I mean, this has got to be wonderful for the viewers to not only be
[01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:47.840]  getting knowledge drops like that, but seeing it in real time. I'm sure Evan, we talk about this
[01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:52.480]  on the show a lot, buddy. I don't know if you were on Overgrow back in the day or IC Mag, but
[01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:57.360]  we lovingly joke that, you know, we'd ask each other questions and sometimes it would take days
[01:16:57.360 --> 01:17:02.960]  to get a response back. Yep. I definitely was on IC Mag for a long time. Yeah. So yeah.
[01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:08.320]  And a lot of that info back in the day. Yeah. There was a, there's a lot of good info on there.
[01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:12.640]  A lot of info that maybe wasn't so great, but it would get you thinking about things like,
[01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:16.720]  you know, mechanical engineering, tackling the whole aspect of mechanical engineering in a
[01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:21.920]  growth facility. I learned a lot off of IC Mag. There was a lot of really good conversations on
[01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:28.720]  there. None of which actually ended up being the way to do it, but it ended up getting the
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:32.720]  wheels turning and really understanding what you're up against on a commercial scale. You know,
[01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:37.680]  and you guys mentioned that, you know, I don't think, and this is what I told Nate when he first
[01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:40.960]  came in and he said that he was a little bit intimidated by the size of the girl. And what I
[01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:47.440]  told him was, I was like, look, man, the challenge isn't really for you to scale up. All you're doing
[01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:53.920]  is replicating what you're doing at scale. The challenge for us in a commercial setting is more
[01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:59.360]  on the mechanical engineering side, in my opinion. You know, that's really where you have to figure
[01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:04.240]  out how to do this. Cause there was a lot of places here in Nevada that were built wrong and
[01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:09.840]  it costs people millions of dollars. You know, I sat in meetings where people in 2014 were saying,
[01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:15.840]  oh man, we're in the desert and the humidity levels here are in 20, 30%. You don't need to
[01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:20.560]  dehumidify these rooms. Don't worry about it. You know, I mean, those conversations really
[01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:24.400]  happened and people really build out the facilities. Those guys have never grown plants before.
[01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:29.920]  I mean, you guys would be in a closet if you... No, I mean, trust me. There's been a lot of money
[01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:35.680]  that's come into cannabis that never grew a plant in their life. So, you know, that's why you see a
[01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:39.120]  lot. And I'm sure the same thing happened in Colorado and every other state you guys look at
[01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:43.440]  is there's a lot of failure going on and it's just because they don't understand what it takes to do
[01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:48.960]  this on a commercial scale. But as far as growers go, you know, you take what you're doing at home
[01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:52.800]  and you can definitely replicate that. There's no doubt about it. I mean, we're proving it. You're
[01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:57.200]  looking at it right here, right now. You know, this is something that Nate perfected in his home
[01:18:57.200 --> 01:19:02.160]  grows and we brought it here and in a year and a half, you know, look at the results.
[01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:09.520]  Now, Nate, are you a self-taught, sir? Well, I do have the traditional, like, you know,
[01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:17.040]  I went to UNLV, graduated biochemistry. But like I said, it was all very oriented towards
[01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:27.200]  the medical field. And so I actually worked in a testing lab here. I was a microbiologist for a
[01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:32.400]  testing lab here. And I ran, I helped them validate their methods and kind of ran their
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:40.000]  micro department for about a year and a half. And in that time, I was kind of really, I found
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:45.360]  the JADAM book. I went through teaming with microbes and I was just like, kind of blown away
[01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:53.520]  that it just made so much sense biologically to me how this stuff worked through natural,
[01:19:54.320 --> 01:20:02.560]  just the symbiosis of nature. And so when I was actually working at the testing lab,
[01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:08.240]  you have a lot of downtime when you're plating things and, you know, incubations, all this sort
[01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:14.800]  of stuff. So I had a lot of downtime to just sit on my computer and read research. So I dove into
[01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:21.200]  anything I could get my hands on that had to do with sustainable gardening and listening to
[01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:27.760]  podcasts all day and people sharing knowledge on different aspects. And it was just one of those
[01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:32.640]  things that's like, oh, wow, that makes sense. That resonates with me. And as I said earlier,
[01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:37.760]  there's a million ways it's going to get people are doing it, running very successful organics
[01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:43.280]  many different ways. And I kind of just was starting to take notes and try things out that
[01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:48.480]  resonated with me and made sense to me. And it just kind of, as it went, it turned into
[01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:55.040]  a little system. And then as Evan offered me to come on here and bring it with me, it was,
[01:20:55.040 --> 01:21:00.880]  it's kind of turned into, it's still getting tweaked and perfected. And it's just, yeah,
[01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:07.360]  very, very self-taught in a way, but still a formal education that really makes it very simple.
[01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:10.400]  I would say I have a very good understanding of the system. So it makes
[01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:15.440]  diving into this research a lot easier to comprehend, I guess.
[01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:20.400]  Absolutely. And Evan, I would say you're, for the most part, you're an experienced man,
[01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:24.640]  self-taught kind of just running this. Is that correct?
[01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:30.960]  Yeah. I mean, I've had a lot of experience as far as business operations goes. My history was
[01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:36.960]  in the hospitality industry. I was with a company called Cahoonaville for 20 plus years. And I was,
[01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:42.000]  I had worked my way up back East. I'm originally from Wilmington, Delaware. And with that company,
[01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:45.760]  before I moved out here to Las Vegas, I had worked my way up to director of operations.
[01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:49.520]  And again, that was just, I didn't have a college degree. That was just all
[01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:54.800]  working my ass off and just proving myself. And as far as growing goes, yeah, that's just been
[01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:59.920]  self-taught. I started in 1986 when I was 16 years old because I didn't want to spend money on weed
[01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:05.840]  and knew I can make some money on weed. So that's how it started and just never stopped. So yeah,
[01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:10.400]  it's just folks, folks, folks back in the day, high times and then eventually,
[01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:15.760]  high times and then eventually forums came online in the early, mid 2000s, early 2000s.
[01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:18.000]  But yeah, it's just all self-taught.
[01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:24.320]  And I really want to see these guys. I mean, you guys went from your respective industries to
[01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:29.280]  educating yourself. And now for a lot of us, you're living the dream. You have a beautiful
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:36.320]  facility, you're running things on next level and you guys obviously have a great rapport with one
[01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:42.480]  another. It seems like that's one of the, we almost use the analogies of the NFL football,
[01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:47.200]  where you need everybody in that locker room, if you will, to believe in the system. And once
[01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:52.640]  everybody trusts that process, it really is amazing when you kind of just let mother nature
[01:22:52.640 --> 01:23:00.160]  do her thing and improve on nature with certain farming concepts. Absolutely. For me, it's all
[01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:04.960]  about relationships in the industry and in the working relationships. It's so important.
[01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:10.560]  And that's one of the things when I came on here was I knew that I need to build a team.
[01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:15.920]  I obviously couldn't do this on my own and I needed some scientific help with a guy like
[01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:21.520]  Nate. And Nate was a guy that I actually had been wanting to work with for years. He's actually
[01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:28.000]  one of the best solventless extraction guys I've ever seen. And I was looking to bring him on at
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:33.520]  Matrix and it just never came to fruition. And originally this project was going to be,
[01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:38.720]  he and I were going to start a solventless line of concentrates coming out of this facility.
[01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:42.480]  I had made a deal with the owner that he and I, Nate and I were going to start doing that,
[01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:47.040]  but then the opportunity came up to run the grow, fortunately. And so that's when I went to Nate,
[01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:50.480]  I said, Hey Nate, I think I have a better opportunity than just pressing rosin.
[01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:55.600]  And so that's, it came up from there, but yeah, Nate and I have known each other for a while
[01:23:55.600 --> 01:24:00.880]  and we've always gotten along great. And for me, that's a really important factor of doing this
[01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:06.720]  is, one of my goals in life is to be asshole free, meaning I don't want any assholes in my life.
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:13.360]  You know, in this industry that's hard to achieve, but I think that we've achieved it. We've just
[01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:19.360]  built this really great team with Nate and Sven and everybody, working with us, the cultivation
[01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:26.320]  team, the guys on that team, I go Will and Angel and Brandon and Eric and gosh, I hope I'm not
[01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:30.000]  forgetting anybody. Nate, don't forget anybody. But yeah, they're all great.
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:31.200]  Johnny, Will.
[01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:32.800]  Johnny. Yes. Johnny and Will.
[01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:34.400]  Yeah. I mean, they do such a-
[01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:35.120]  Great, great guys.
[01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:38.720]  They do an amazing job for us. Like none of it would be possible without them.
[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:39.280]  They really do.
[01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:43.040]  You know, they have a great work ethic. It's unbelievable how hard they come in here and
[01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:45.760]  work for us. And we're very grateful for it.
[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:51.200]  Extremely. And that's the thing, man. Like I said, you know, you need that positive energy.
[01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:54.720]  You need those good people around the plants every day, or you're not going to be successful.
[01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:58.480]  And you need to be able to work with each other and basically live with each other on a daily
[01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:03.280]  basis. And I think that we've got a really good thing going, man. You know, we're all good friends.
[01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:04.720]  And that's really important.
[01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:09.200]  And that's the real beauty. When the team comes together, everybody's excited to come to work
[01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:13.840]  every day. Things continue to improve. And that's really the whole beauty of this. When everybody
[01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:19.360]  buys in, from the investors down to the trimmers, everybody realizes that, hey, we have a common
[01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:24.400]  goal. You know, certain people even get bonuses and stuff when they over exceed expectations.
[01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:29.440]  And I do feel like everybody buys into that system. As the months go by, everybody's pocket
[01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:33.840]  gets a little bit fatter. Everybody enjoys coming to work a little bit more. The plants definitely
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:35.040]  seem to respond to that.
[01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:40.720]  That couldn't be more true. That's absolutely right. And you know, one of the things I said,
[01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:45.040]  I was just interviewed in one of the local Vegas magazines here, Vegas Cannabis. And one of the
[01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:49.280]  things I said, and I've been saying for years, is I've always kind of wanted to model our company
[01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:54.160]  like to be like the Google of marijuana, meaning that Google, everybody that I've always heard,
[01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:58.160]  everybody wants to work at Google. It's one of the greatest companies in the world to work for.
[01:25:58.160 --> 01:26:03.520]  And I kind of wanted to model Fleur after that or any company I'm involved in. I want everybody to
[01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:08.720]  be excited to come to work every day and feel like they're treated with respect and dignity and
[01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:14.080]  treated equally than anybody else. No one looks down on anybody in our facility, in our business.
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:17.840]  Everybody's an equal and everybody does their part and everybody's part of the team and part
[01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:18.720]  of the family.
[01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:19.840]  It's really important.
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:22.320]  Free food in the cafeteria all day long.
[01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:26.960]  If only. Yeah, we do provide some free food, but I actually did that.
[01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:27.840]  They get more perks than that.
[01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:29.680]  Yeah, we did that at Matrix.
[01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:30.880]  Free weed, free weed.
[01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:38.080]  My mom ran all of my books at Matrix. So she was basically, we called her the den mother. And so
[01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:44.160]  we actually fed everybody there and we had a weekly shipment of Costco supplies coming in there.
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:49.440]  All the food from Costco every week. It got pretty expensive, but it was awesome.
[01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:53.440]  And we do some of that here at Fleur too. We're not feeding everybody like we did there, but
[01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:57.920]  at the same time we are providing food and a nice break room. And then we'll have certain days of
[01:26:57.920 --> 01:27:03.120]  the week or the month where we'll have a pizza Friday or something like that. We need to start
[01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:08.400]  doing taco Tuesdays actually. I love taco Tuesday.
[01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:11.840]  Yeah. I haven't implemented a taco Tuesday, but I think it's time.
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.240]  Peter, you know why Google implemented that?
[01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:16.400]  Say that again?
[01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:20.400]  Do you guys know why Google implemented where they're going to feed their employees healthy
[01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:20.900]  food?
[01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:23.120]  No. Well, I can guess.
[01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:27.440]  There's such statisticians that they noticed that productivity went up when it wasn't just
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:28.960]  pizza and hotdogs and stuff.
[01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:32.400]  Absolutely. Absolutely. That makes a whole lot of sense.
[01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:38.080]  Juan, yeah. It's two things. One, the healthy food keeps them healthy and productive and then
[01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:42.320]  also not going out to lunch keeps them in the office.
[01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:43.360]  Sure. Keeps them in the hive.
[01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:45.360]  Keeps them in the office.
[01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:45.860]  That's right.
[01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:54.960]  So just quickly, Nate, before this question gets lost, someone asked about do you defoliate
[01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:57.520]  and if yes, at what stages in the cycle?
[01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:02.480]  Yeah. So we do two, essentially two upruns.
[01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:08.720]  What's awesome about the KF is that I'm still using a I'm still using a ferment that I made
[01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:09.440]  from a year ago.
[01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:16.240]  So a lot of what we do right at flip will come in like Evan mentioned earlier.
[01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:17.840]  We do farm for clones.
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:22.160]  So right at flip is the last day before we flip.
[01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:27.760]  We take our clones and then as we take clones, we'll go through and kind of up prune, shave
[01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:30.320]  all the legs pretty much and kind of do the rest of the farm.
[01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:34.800]  Up prune, shave all the legs, pretty much anything that's going to be below the trellis.
[01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:38.480]  You can kind of see how they were cleaned up at one point.
[01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:42.240]  And then obviously, as they grow up a little bit again, you can kind of see there.
[01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:48.480]  So we will up prune right there at the flip and we go fairly aggressive at that point.
[01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:54.640]  And again, right at week three, sometime during week three, we try and get in there and get in
[01:28:54.640 --> 01:28:59.280]  and get some of the larvae kind of airy, not very good buds out and really just try and
[01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:04.000]  focus that energy on our canopy that's coming out and like, you know, really going to grow
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:05.200]  robustly through the trellis.
[01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:10.720]  So we right at flip and then week three to directly answer his question.
[01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:17.680]  And then at what time of the plants day do you do your foliar spraying?
[01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:23.040]  We actually have green lights as you get that all along the roof.
[01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:24.000]  We have green lights.
[01:29:24.880 --> 01:29:29.840]  So all I do is just turn off the main lights and I'll come in here and spray and we'll leave
[01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:31.040]  them off for about two hours.
[01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:33.520]  So there's not really like a time of day.
[01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:35.120]  We just make sure we turn off all the lights.
[01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:42.720]  And up until just in case this gets asked, I will spray up until about midweek three.
[01:29:42.720 --> 01:29:46.720]  I think around day 17 after the flip is where I generally try and cut it off at.
[01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:50.800]  So that was an interesting comment.
[01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:54.960]  So you turn on the green lights and shut everything else down and then feed.
[01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:56.720]  So you're kind of giving them a nap.
[01:29:57.760 --> 01:29:58.000]  Yeah.
[01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:02.720]  So we just pretty much I just don't want to spray the plants with have a nice, like shiny
[01:30:02.720 --> 01:30:04.720]  layer of moisture on the leaves.
[01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:09.600]  It just I feel like it creates kind of that magnifying glass effect where with the light
[01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:13.520]  intensity that we're just constantly having these under, they don't really get there's
[01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:14.720]  obviously no shade.
[01:30:14.720 --> 01:30:17.840]  So I feel like just letting them absorb.
[01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:20.240]  We pretty much turn them off for about an hour, hour and a half.
[01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:26.720]  Let the foliar absorb into the leaves and we throw it back on once they pretty much
[01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:28.560]  look fairly dry across the room.
[01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:31.760]  So cookies and milk and a nap.
[01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:33.200]  Pretty much.
[01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:35.360]  I love it, dude.
[01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:36.800]  Love it.
[01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:38.720]  Make sure they don't get temperamental with us.
[01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:42.960]  I like it too, man.
[01:30:42.960 --> 01:30:47.120]  And I mean, it is a big facility that you can't really you're always going to have
[01:30:47.120 --> 01:30:47.360]  that.
[01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:49.040]  We always have like in every room.
[01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:51.200]  I feel like we have that one pouty bed.
[01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:53.520]  It just no matter what we do, it gets the same everything.
[01:30:53.520 --> 01:30:56.480]  And it just it just pouty from the get go.
[01:30:56.480 --> 01:31:02.000]  And so we always have these, you know, the constant struggles of certain strains get
[01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:02.640]  temperamental.
[01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:04.480]  You know, there's a yellow spot here.
[01:31:04.480 --> 01:31:09.440]  And so, yeah, it's just trying to trying to keep them happy.
[01:31:12.630 --> 01:31:12.870]  Yeah.
[01:31:13.750 --> 01:31:16.310]  Imagine that sometimes females are a little finicky.
[01:31:16.310 --> 01:31:18.470]  I was going to say that's a lot of girls to keep happy.
[01:31:21.910 --> 01:31:25.110]  So, you know, you mentioned that you really understand solventless.
[01:31:25.110 --> 01:31:28.390]  Are you guys are you getting rid of all of that as flower?
[01:31:28.390 --> 01:31:29.910]  Are you guys doing any fresh frozen?
[01:31:30.870 --> 01:31:31.910]  Is that in the pipeline?
[01:31:32.550 --> 01:31:34.950]  So everything that we're doing is flower.
[01:31:34.950 --> 01:31:37.910]  We have not we have been talking about doing rosin.
[01:31:38.470 --> 01:31:43.670]  There are some issues around the way the state taxes rosin to the point where it's really
[01:31:43.670 --> 01:31:45.350]  not profitable for us to do it.
[01:31:45.350 --> 01:31:49.350]  And that's honestly why you're not seeing it made a whole lot in Nevada.
[01:31:50.230 --> 01:31:54.310]  But the other problem for us is that, I mean, it's not well, it's a good problem to have,
[01:31:54.310 --> 01:31:56.230]  but we're selling out of everything.
[01:31:56.230 --> 01:32:00.710]  And we and the demand for our flower right now is so high that we don't really have any
[01:32:00.710 --> 01:32:03.510]  excess to press unless we were going to do trim.
[01:32:04.150 --> 01:32:07.430]  But, you know, the trim we actually feed.
[01:32:07.430 --> 01:32:12.150]  So another part of this company is an edible brand called Evergreen Organics, which was
[01:32:12.150 --> 01:32:16.230]  one of the first, if not the first edible brands in the state during medical.
[01:32:16.230 --> 01:32:20.470]  And so all of our trim goes to feed the beast in Evergreen Organics.
[01:32:20.470 --> 01:32:23.030]  That's all, you know, all of our trim is going towards edibles.
[01:32:23.750 --> 01:32:27.910]  So, you know, we've talked about it and it's something we definitely want to do.
[01:32:27.910 --> 01:32:31.430]  It makes all the sense in the world to be pressing rosin in an organic facility.
[01:32:31.430 --> 01:32:36.390]  And, you know, I love dabs and it's something that I would love to be dabbing, but it's
[01:32:36.390 --> 01:32:41.030]  not something that we were currently doing, but we are looking to do down the road.
[01:32:41.030 --> 01:32:45.830]  Hopefully the state fixes the tax issue surrounding it.
[01:32:45.830 --> 01:32:51.430]  The other issue for us was with rosin was that getting the equipment approval from the
[01:32:51.430 --> 01:32:58.550]  state was not possible because they needed all those bags to be food grade material.
[01:32:58.550 --> 01:33:03.350]  And none of the companies that were making those bags were willing to basically make
[01:33:03.350 --> 01:33:07.270]  them food grade material or at least put on their spec sheets that they were food grade
[01:33:07.270 --> 01:33:07.990]  material.
[01:33:07.990 --> 01:33:12.550]  So we couldn't even get the equipment approved to make rosin for years until they finally
[01:33:12.550 --> 01:33:14.550]  started making those bags out of food grade material.
[01:33:14.550 --> 01:33:19.430]  And now we can finally start making it, but it's taken a while.
[01:33:21.590 --> 01:33:21.910]  Yeah.
[01:33:21.910 --> 01:33:25.110]  You guys are building a freight train, you know, and each one of those, like Nate was
[01:33:25.110 --> 01:33:29.590]  saying, sometimes those little utopias just don't become those utopias that they should.
[01:33:29.590 --> 01:33:32.390]  So you kind of got to, again, manage those, continue.
[01:33:32.390 --> 01:33:36.790]  And again, you know, we've talked many times on this show lately, you know, it's brought
[01:33:36.790 --> 01:33:41.750]  up the, just a day in a plant's life, a week in a plant's life is an extremely long time
[01:33:41.750 --> 01:33:44.230]  compared to other, other things in life.
[01:33:45.030 --> 01:33:45.530]  For sure.
[01:33:46.630 --> 01:33:47.510]  That's for sure.
[01:33:47.510 --> 01:33:50.950]  It's a slow moving process here.
[01:33:51.670 --> 01:33:56.070]  Sorry, it wouldn't be a future cannabis project without the gear knocking over the dab bar.
[01:33:57.670 --> 01:33:58.390]  I mean, it sounds great.
[01:33:58.390 --> 01:34:00.310]  You didn't earn that nickname for nothing.
[01:34:03.270 --> 01:34:04.310]  Once a show, bro.
[01:34:04.390 --> 01:34:07.830]  So I would imagine, you guys want to kind of get into the questions, because I would
[01:34:07.830 --> 01:34:12.550]  imagine they're going to come at you boys probably more than other guests, especially
[01:34:12.550 --> 01:34:16.070]  with you guys, you know, doing this the entire time in the facility.
[01:34:16.070 --> 01:34:17.590]  We really do appreciate that.
[01:34:17.590 --> 01:34:22.870]  And by the way, I'm thinking you guys could probably find somewhere comfortable to sit
[01:34:22.870 --> 01:34:23.510]  for a minute.
[01:34:24.310 --> 01:34:25.030]  Oh yeah, okay.
[01:34:25.910 --> 01:34:26.470]  I got it.
[01:34:26.470 --> 01:34:27.910]  I wheeled a chair in my room here.
[01:34:29.190 --> 01:34:30.070]  Yeah, all right.
[01:34:30.790 --> 01:34:33.270]  Somewhere you can kick back, take the mask off.
[01:34:34.470 --> 01:34:37.350]  There's not a whole lot of places like that in this facility, honestly.
[01:34:38.950 --> 01:34:40.790]  No, you guys, you're doing too much work.
[01:34:40.790 --> 01:34:42.070]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:34:42.070 --> 01:34:43.590]  Nate has a seat in the...
[01:34:43.590 --> 01:34:46.630]  You can see like, you know, I step in the hallway and it's getting vacuumed.
[01:34:49.190 --> 01:34:50.150]  All right, there it goes.
[01:34:50.150 --> 01:34:50.950]  You can keep going.
[01:34:51.510 --> 01:34:52.070]  Keep working.
[01:34:55.030 --> 01:34:55.590]  Anyway.
[01:34:55.590 --> 01:34:59.190]  So like, when you guys switch this over, I mean, what were some of the things that, you
[01:34:59.190 --> 01:35:03.350]  know, people that don't understand your system, you guys came in here, it's a whole new program.
[01:35:05.110 --> 01:35:07.030]  What were some of the things they immediately noticed?
[01:35:07.030 --> 01:35:10.950]  Like praying leaves, probably, you know, the overall health of...
[01:35:10.950 --> 01:35:15.670]  So our viewers can kind of see on a commercial level how you are able to change things within
[01:35:15.670 --> 01:35:16.550]  like a flip or two.
[01:35:18.310 --> 01:35:20.310]  Oh, it took a bit longer than a flip.
[01:35:21.190 --> 01:35:22.470]  To get things back on track.
[01:35:22.470 --> 01:35:23.030]  Is that what you mean?
[01:35:23.750 --> 01:35:24.710]  Yeah, just kind of...
[01:35:24.710 --> 01:35:28.470]  Yeah, I want to know more about your story, like how you guys were able to kind of skirt
[01:35:28.470 --> 01:35:30.470]  this, because this is for us on this show.
[01:35:30.470 --> 01:35:34.070]  This is exactly what we want people to see is you guys took the time.
[01:35:34.070 --> 01:35:38.470]  Self-educated, found a way to get funding to make everything work for you guys.
[01:35:38.470 --> 01:35:39.750]  And now, you know, you're...
[01:35:39.750 --> 01:35:43.350]  I don't know if you guys are best friends, but obviously great friends where you're able
[01:35:43.350 --> 01:35:49.430]  to operate a facility on it on such a large scale with relative ease.
[01:35:49.430 --> 01:35:53.350]  I mean, I'm sure behind the scenes there's nightmare days, but that's one of the best
[01:35:53.350 --> 01:35:56.150]  facilities at the level that you guys are growing that I've personally ever seen.
[01:35:57.270 --> 01:35:57.910]  Thank you.
[01:35:57.910 --> 01:35:58.870]  That means a lot to us.
[01:35:58.870 --> 01:35:59.670]  We appreciate that.
[01:36:00.630 --> 01:36:04.630]  Personally, just what I experienced working with these guys.
[01:36:05.590 --> 01:36:09.990]  So, when me and Evan came on, the team had already been fairly established.
[01:36:09.990 --> 01:36:16.790]  Guys have been here for, you know, up to about three years, almost since this place had got
[01:36:16.790 --> 01:36:17.290]  lit.
[01:36:30.470 --> 01:36:36.870]  So, what we just saw like an immediate response.
[01:36:36.870 --> 01:36:40.870]  And I think a lot of the guys were pretty down and out based on how things were going
[01:36:40.870 --> 01:36:44.790]  that just any improvement they got really excited about.
[01:36:44.790 --> 01:36:47.830]  So, it was really easy to get these guys on board and buy in.
[01:36:47.830 --> 01:36:52.550]  It really took no time at all as far as the cohesive unit of things.
[01:36:53.510 --> 01:36:59.670]  We had a few bad apples that we had to get rid of in the whole top to bottom process,
[01:36:59.670 --> 01:37:03.190]  but it was very, very much so.
[01:37:04.070 --> 01:37:05.030]  Very smooth transition.
[01:37:05.030 --> 01:37:08.150]  They all bought in and we started seeing results.
[01:37:08.150 --> 01:37:11.830]  I would say improvement on a very immediate basis.
[01:37:12.390 --> 01:37:15.830]  And they were excited about it and bought in.
[01:37:15.830 --> 01:37:20.150]  And so, it was really great to just get that trust from them very early on.
[01:37:20.310 --> 01:37:25.110]  Kind of like brought in Mr. Brady and Mr. Gronkowski and took the Bucks to the Super Bowl.
[01:37:25.110 --> 01:37:27.190]  You guys turned that around.
[01:37:27.190 --> 01:37:28.710]  Congratulations to you.
[01:37:28.710 --> 01:37:29.210]  Thank you.
[01:37:29.910 --> 01:37:32.470]  I don't know if we had that much respect coming in here, but yeah.
[01:37:32.470 --> 01:37:34.470]  It's good.
[01:37:34.470 --> 01:37:36.790]  Having an aircraft carrier on takes some energy.
[01:37:36.790 --> 01:37:41.590]  Yeah, we definitely had to prove ourselves to certain people in this building for sure,
[01:37:41.590 --> 01:37:42.470]  you know, that stuck around.
[01:37:42.470 --> 01:37:46.870]  But it took time and like Nate said, everybody has bought into what we're doing.
[01:37:46.870 --> 01:37:50.070]  This place had not seen success for a long time.
[01:37:50.070 --> 01:37:53.830]  So, I can totally understand people being skeptical of anybody coming in.
[01:37:54.470 --> 01:37:56.630]  And now, that's totally the opposite though.
[01:37:56.630 --> 01:37:59.350]  Everybody here has completely bought into what we're doing and loves it.
[01:38:00.150 --> 01:38:05.830]  Yeah, success is the easiest thing after that is for people to really buy into your system is just,
[01:38:06.390 --> 01:38:07.590]  are they successful?
[01:38:07.590 --> 01:38:08.950]  You guys clearly are.
[01:38:08.950 --> 01:38:10.230]  So, congratulations.
[01:38:10.230 --> 01:38:10.870]  Thank you.
[01:38:10.870 --> 01:38:12.310]  Success breeds success.
[01:38:12.310 --> 01:38:12.810]  Amen.
[01:38:13.370 --> 01:38:15.210]  So, we do have a lot of questions.
[01:38:15.210 --> 01:38:15.710]  Okay.
[01:38:15.770 --> 01:38:16.270]  Go.
[01:38:16.330 --> 01:38:17.370]  You guys ready?
[01:38:17.370 --> 01:38:18.570]  Nate, I hope you're ready, buddy.
[01:38:18.570 --> 01:38:19.370]  This should be fun.
[01:38:19.370 --> 01:38:20.410]  Oh, wow.
[01:38:20.410 --> 01:38:20.910]  All right.
[01:38:21.850 --> 01:38:23.370]  I got a feeling Nate's going to be busy on this one.
[01:38:24.250 --> 01:38:24.750]  All right.
[01:38:24.810 --> 01:38:26.890]  So, the first one comes from my mom.
[01:38:27.850 --> 01:38:28.490]  No, I'm joking.
[01:38:28.490 --> 01:38:31.850]  We're still watching.
[01:38:31.850 --> 01:38:35.850]  So, Green's Goddess is full of questions today.
[01:38:35.850 --> 01:38:40.170]  She asks, recently, I've been watching a lot of TV shows.
[01:38:40.170 --> 01:38:41.610]  This is full of questions today.
[01:38:41.610 --> 01:38:45.290]  She asks, reamending beds after harvest.
[01:38:45.290 --> 01:38:50.650]  So, what's kind of the post-harvest to next planting protocol?
[01:38:52.810 --> 01:38:55.370]  How long do you wait after you harvest to replant?
[01:38:55.370 --> 01:38:56.410]  Are you reamending?
[01:38:58.170 --> 01:39:05.290]  We generally have our harvest ends on a, like Evan mentioned earlier, we do a four-day harvest.
[01:39:06.170 --> 01:39:10.010]  It's literally two guys that harvest these entire rooms.
[01:39:11.450 --> 01:39:14.330]  And every once in a while, we'll throw them extra hands when they need it.
[01:39:14.330 --> 01:39:18.250]  But it's, for the most part, those two guys are just crushers.
[01:39:19.290 --> 01:39:22.010]  They go hard when it comes to getting these plants down.
[01:39:22.010 --> 01:39:26.890]  So, in the middle of the week, Tuesday will be our last day we harvest.
[01:39:26.890 --> 01:39:30.970]  We're in here the next day digging holes for the next plants.
[01:39:31.530 --> 01:39:34.090]  And we'll dig holes, place plants on that Wednesday.
[01:39:34.090 --> 01:39:35.370]  And then that next Thursday.
[01:39:35.370 --> 01:39:37.530]  So, it's literally like a day and a half turnaround.
[01:39:37.530 --> 01:39:39.530]  We'll have plants in the ground again.
[01:39:40.570 --> 01:39:45.530]  And so, we'll cut our plants at soil level.
[01:39:46.330 --> 01:39:48.890]  You know, leave the root ball, let it all die out.
[01:39:48.890 --> 01:39:52.890]  As Leighton mentioned earlier, there's such significant benefits to leaving those root
[01:39:52.890 --> 01:39:53.690]  balls in there.
[01:39:53.690 --> 01:39:58.250]  Not only does it help aeration, and as that dies, you know, it gives new roots, new places
[01:39:58.250 --> 01:39:58.570]  to go.
[01:39:58.570 --> 01:39:59.850]  It's still full of nutrition.
[01:40:00.250 --> 01:40:03.530]  The fungal networks that are still active on there.
[01:40:03.530 --> 01:40:07.850]  And so, we chop right there, soil level.
[01:40:08.650 --> 01:40:15.690]  After we get our plants in, we'll generally do, water them in with like a compost tea.
[01:40:15.690 --> 01:40:19.530]  At this point, we have kind of been going back to RO.
[01:40:20.090 --> 01:40:22.410]  I think our soil is pretty fertile at this point.
[01:40:22.970 --> 01:40:29.290]  I think it's probably more of a makes me feel better type thing to put compost in when we
[01:40:29.290 --> 01:40:30.010]  do replant.
[01:40:31.050 --> 01:40:35.050]  And then we do what we call our one-one-one mix here.
[01:40:36.170 --> 01:40:37.130]  It's actually four parts.
[01:40:37.130 --> 01:40:37.850]  It was three parts.
[01:40:37.850 --> 01:40:38.570]  We added a four.
[01:40:38.570 --> 01:40:40.250]  So, we still call it one-one-one.
[01:40:40.250 --> 01:40:41.930]  But it's actually equal parts of each.
[01:40:41.930 --> 01:40:48.090]  We do kelp, crustacean meal, alfalfa meal, and fishbone meal.
[01:40:48.090 --> 01:40:49.930]  And then we do a mix of those.
[01:40:50.810 --> 01:40:51.610]  Fishbone meal.
[01:40:52.170 --> 01:40:58.330]  And we'll go around and we do about two cups per four by four square on our beds.
[01:40:58.890 --> 01:41:00.410]  So, about four cups a bed.
[01:41:01.690 --> 01:41:06.250]  We generally have all the leaf mulch that we had trimmed up from the harvest that we'll
[01:41:06.250 --> 01:41:06.890]  lay down.
[01:41:06.890 --> 01:41:09.850]  And then we'll cover that with a layer of okashi.
[01:41:11.130 --> 01:41:12.810]  And then we'll remulch everything.
[01:41:12.810 --> 01:41:16.090]  So, then we'll put all the alfalfa hay onto the side.
[01:41:16.090 --> 01:41:18.970]  And then recover it with the mulch at the very end.
[01:41:18.970 --> 01:41:27.290]  So, we get our crustacean, alfalfa, kelp, fishbone, a little bit of okashi, and then
[01:41:28.090 --> 01:41:28.730]  leaf waste.
[01:41:28.730 --> 01:41:31.850]  It's pretty much every cycle is how we're going to re-amend them.
[01:41:33.450 --> 01:41:34.250]  Good playbook.
[01:41:35.050 --> 01:41:36.090]  Appreciate that, sir.
[01:41:37.130 --> 01:41:38.650]  Yeah, that sounds fantastic.
[01:41:38.650 --> 01:41:40.810]  I mean, again, it's all biological food.
[01:41:40.810 --> 01:41:44.650]  It's going to be active or, you know, it's going to be released as the plant needs it,
[01:41:44.650 --> 01:41:45.530]  not all at once.
[01:41:46.410 --> 01:41:47.850]  It sounds like an amazing system.
[01:41:48.570 --> 01:41:50.330]  I know some people bring up kelp.
[01:41:51.130 --> 01:41:53.050]  Have you guys had any issue with that?
[01:41:53.050 --> 01:41:55.610]  You know, there's some people that say if you're going to use kelp, you're going to
[01:41:55.610 --> 01:41:57.210]  start failing tests.
[01:41:58.490 --> 01:42:00.170]  Have you experienced any of that, guys?
[01:42:01.130 --> 01:42:01.630]  No.
[01:42:02.730 --> 01:42:05.850]  I actually just listened to Bryant.
[01:42:05.850 --> 01:42:09.610]  I know, I think you guys have actually had him on here before.
[01:42:09.610 --> 01:42:11.930]  Soil Doctor on IG.
[01:42:11.930 --> 01:42:16.170]  He's one of my favorite people to listen to when it comes to this stuff.
[01:42:16.170 --> 01:42:20.490]  It's like that dude just hits play and it just spouts off knowledge after knowledge
[01:42:20.490 --> 01:42:21.130]  after knowledge.
[01:42:21.130 --> 01:42:23.930]  So he's very, very enjoyable to listen to.
[01:42:24.810 --> 01:42:32.170]  And he was actually just speaking on the whole sodium as a cation in the soil and how it's
[01:42:32.170 --> 01:42:41.450]  more of a balancing act as far as I would say it's as a soil cation to maintain charge
[01:42:41.450 --> 01:42:41.950]  balance.
[01:42:42.910 --> 01:42:46.750]  It's very, I wouldn't say beneficial, but needed.
[01:42:46.750 --> 01:42:52.830]  And it's not something I know enough about personally to really like be able to speak
[01:42:52.830 --> 01:42:54.270]  on it in any depth.
[01:42:54.270 --> 01:43:00.110]  But we haven't seen thus far any problems with the amount of kelp that we have been
[01:43:00.110 --> 01:43:00.610]  adding.
[01:43:03.070 --> 01:43:06.590]  And you guys are obviously all using all organic sources and that kind of thing.
[01:43:07.230 --> 01:43:12.190]  So as long as I would imagine, as long as you know your sources, obviously, you know
[01:43:12.190 --> 01:43:12.990]  your recipe.
[01:43:12.990 --> 01:43:15.310]  So why would you have to build a soil?
[01:43:15.870 --> 01:43:17.070]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:43:17.070 --> 01:43:17.870]  Mr. Silva.
[01:43:18.670 --> 01:43:24.430]  And you've touched on some of this, but can you kind of walk through this is from Miles.
[01:43:26.270 --> 01:43:27.070]  What up Miles?
[01:43:28.430 --> 01:43:29.550]  Weed should taste good.
[01:43:30.510 --> 01:43:31.790]  Who's that guy right there?
[01:43:32.510 --> 01:43:38.990]  So you had mentioned, I mean, the just inputs, JADAM, KNF.
[01:43:40.910 --> 01:43:48.110]  Yeah, so all of our ferments we do make, we make our calcium acetate, which is from the
[01:43:48.110 --> 01:43:48.670]  eggshells.
[01:43:48.670 --> 01:43:54.510]  We pretty much just a simple acid based reaction, vinegar, eggshells, and you get a water
[01:43:54.510 --> 01:43:59.230]  soluble calcium acetate when that is fully reacted.
[01:43:59.230 --> 01:44:06.030]  We make our lab in-house, just very traditional KNF recipes when it comes to like the calcium
[01:44:06.030 --> 01:44:06.590]  in the lab.
[01:44:07.870 --> 01:44:13.550]  The ferments that we do at the different stages of growth, whether it be our finished ferment,
[01:44:13.550 --> 01:44:21.790]  which we add at the end of flour, the transition or the veg, those are all coming from our
[01:44:21.790 --> 01:44:23.870]  own garden and made in-house.
[01:44:24.510 --> 01:44:30.590]  Our wetting agent that we use to, you know, the surfactant for all the sprays that's made
[01:44:30.590 --> 01:44:31.070]  in-house.
[01:44:32.830 --> 01:44:41.390]  We are, as far as the IMOs, just based on being an indoor garden, I kind of just to
[01:44:41.390 --> 01:44:45.950]  me, it didn't make a whole lot of sense to go collect all this stuff and kind of bring
[01:44:45.950 --> 01:44:52.590]  it in here from the outside being as how it's like, it's 120 degrees outside and our garment
[01:44:53.310 --> 01:44:56.430]  climate control to 75, 80 degrees.
[01:44:56.430 --> 01:45:01.790]  So it is the fall off biologically, it just didn't add up.
[01:45:01.790 --> 01:45:12.190]  So the only way that we kind of get some of the indigenous mold spores is when we do part
[01:45:12.190 --> 01:45:18.110]  of the Bokashi, as I mentioned earlier, we do shred all of our stem waste in a wood chipper.
[01:45:18.110 --> 01:45:24.910]  And since all of that doesn't really have the time to dry out that essentially to get
[01:45:24.910 --> 01:45:28.910]  fully dry, we'll go through the wood chipper, some of the wood will still be wet.
[01:45:28.910 --> 01:45:33.630]  And as it kind of sits when we're waiting to use it in one of our toads out there, it'll
[01:45:33.630 --> 01:45:39.390]  actually start naturally accumulating just mold spores and fungus within the from the
[01:45:39.390 --> 01:45:40.190]  air.
[01:45:40.190 --> 01:45:45.950]  And so that's kind of, I would say, our equivalent to like the indigenous microorganisms.
[01:45:45.950 --> 01:45:53.230]  But the Bokashi that we're making would probably be like the most direct thing that would be
[01:45:53.230 --> 01:45:56.750]  a parallel, I guess, to like an IMO.
[01:45:57.310 --> 01:46:00.270]  We do use a little bit of compost that we do make in house.
[01:46:00.270 --> 01:46:05.310]  It turned into being kind of more of a hassle than benefit is kind of why we steered towards
[01:46:05.310 --> 01:46:06.270]  the Bokashi way.
[01:46:06.270 --> 01:46:11.230]  But we still do apply some compost teas and things like that infrequently.
[01:46:11.870 --> 01:46:17.310]  And so, yeah, for the most part, it's about half and half when we're ordering dry amendments
[01:46:17.310 --> 01:46:20.510]  and like the coconut powder, aloe powder.
[01:46:20.510 --> 01:46:24.670]  That's also that's obviously coming from one of our suppliers.
[01:46:24.670 --> 01:46:30.910]  But yeah, the Bokashi, the lab, the calcium, the ferments, all that stuff is being made
[01:46:30.910 --> 01:46:32.830]  here in house with all of our plant waste.
[01:46:34.110 --> 01:46:37.790]  I see a lot of the viewers were asking, are you guys using worms?
[01:46:37.790 --> 01:46:39.710]  I know you mentioned at the beginning.
[01:46:39.710 --> 01:46:43.710]  I saw some questions where they wanted to know exactly like what level you held one
[01:46:43.710 --> 01:46:43.870]  up.
[01:46:44.510 --> 01:46:46.430]  No, but I'm saying at the level that they're using.
[01:46:48.510 --> 01:46:49.390]  Yeah, we're we.
[01:46:51.150 --> 01:46:52.510]  Oh, yeah, go for it.
[01:46:52.510 --> 01:46:53.310]  No, no, no, it's OK.
[01:46:53.310 --> 01:46:53.950]  You go ahead.
[01:46:53.950 --> 01:46:59.230]  And actually, Nate, just quickly, do you have your earbud case anywhere close by?
[01:46:59.870 --> 01:47:00.110]  Can you?
[01:47:00.910 --> 01:47:01.150]  Yeah.
[01:47:01.150 --> 01:47:02.750]  Can you remove the earbuds?
[01:47:02.750 --> 01:47:04.670]  I think your audio will sound better.
[01:47:05.310 --> 01:47:06.110]  OK, let's see.
[01:47:10.270 --> 01:47:11.070]  You guys hear me?
[01:47:12.350 --> 01:47:12.590]  Yeah.
[01:47:13.710 --> 01:47:13.950]  Yeah.
[01:47:15.230 --> 01:47:19.950]  So, yes, we are using worms bought from Uncle Jim's Worm Farm.
[01:47:19.950 --> 01:47:23.790]  We were using European, mainly European night crawlers.
[01:47:24.990 --> 01:47:26.670]  And what was the range?
[01:47:26.670 --> 01:47:34.750]  It was like five worms per every square foot was what the target was on purchasing those.
[01:47:34.750 --> 01:47:38.350]  Yeah, I went around about to ask that question, but I appreciate it.
[01:47:38.350 --> 01:47:42.510]  I think a lot of people really want to start to understand that because I feel like that
[01:47:42.510 --> 01:47:46.430]  is where they can really start to trust the process is when you can visually see with
[01:47:46.430 --> 01:47:49.630]  the naked eye that the soil food web is coming alive and starting to thrive.
[01:47:50.270 --> 01:47:50.830]  Absolutely.
[01:47:51.390 --> 01:47:55.070]  You know, we have a lot of springtails, like you mentioned, roly polies, and then the worms
[01:47:55.070 --> 01:47:55.790]  are key as well.
[01:47:56.750 --> 01:47:59.230]  Now, I found guys I'm playing with isopods and stuff.
[01:48:00.110 --> 01:48:05.550]  If you want to for some of them, I feel like if you're able to do cut cucumbers and place
[01:48:05.550 --> 01:48:09.790]  those around, the isopods will come and collect on that cucumber.
[01:48:09.790 --> 01:48:10.990]  I'm sorry, I didn't hear the question.
[01:48:10.990 --> 01:48:13.710]  I was trying to get out of the audio.
[01:48:13.710 --> 01:48:15.550]  It's a little bit different now for me with the…
[01:48:15.550 --> 01:48:17.790]  Actually, Nate should probably put his headset back in.
[01:48:17.790 --> 01:48:18.030]  Yeah.
[01:48:19.390 --> 01:48:20.190]  We regress.
[01:48:20.910 --> 01:48:22.350]  Nate, why don't you put your headset back in?
[01:48:22.350 --> 01:48:22.670]  You don't…
[01:48:22.670 --> 01:48:23.550]  He can barely hear me.
[01:48:23.550 --> 01:48:24.350]  There we go.
[01:48:24.350 --> 01:48:25.070]  Yeah, there you go.
[01:48:25.070 --> 01:48:26.030]  There we go, yeah.
[01:48:26.030 --> 01:48:27.070]  It was on my…
[01:48:27.070 --> 01:48:29.550]  They were still connected on my pods, I guess.
[01:48:31.710 --> 01:48:33.630]  So, I didn't even hear the question.
[01:48:33.630 --> 01:48:34.190]  What was that?
[01:48:35.070 --> 01:48:35.710]  All right.
[01:48:35.710 --> 01:48:40.110]  I was just letting you guys know we play around with isopods here in Denver, and we've noticed
[01:48:40.110 --> 01:48:46.270]  that if you have cucumbers, that for whatever reason, a variety of isopods, roly-polies,
[01:48:46.270 --> 01:48:48.750]  will come to that, almost like the avocado tech.
[01:48:48.750 --> 01:48:53.150]  And then when they're all on that, you can remove them from your beds if you guys have
[01:48:53.150 --> 01:48:53.710]  too many of them.
[01:48:53.710 --> 01:48:54.190]  They also look sweet.
[01:48:54.190 --> 01:48:54.750]  Yeah, we were using…
[01:48:56.350 --> 01:48:58.750]  We have done all kinds of roly-poly traps.
[01:48:58.750 --> 01:49:02.190]  Early on, we were actually using yeast traps, aka beer.
[01:49:03.150 --> 01:49:03.630]  Yeah.
[01:49:03.630 --> 01:49:08.430]  Where we were filling a cup halfway and then sinking it down the soil level, and they were
[01:49:08.430 --> 01:49:10.030]  just going in there like it was party time.
[01:49:10.030 --> 01:49:11.070]  It actually worked really well.
[01:49:12.110 --> 01:49:14.030]  And then we were also using cantaloupes.
[01:49:14.030 --> 01:49:16.990]  Those were working very well, just like you were talking about cucumbers.
[01:49:18.190 --> 01:49:18.750]  Yeah.
[01:49:18.750 --> 01:49:19.790]  So, for you guys out there…
[01:49:20.830 --> 01:49:21.390]  Oh, go ahead.
[01:49:21.390 --> 01:49:22.110]  Sorry.
[01:49:22.110 --> 01:49:24.350]  I was just saying that's another tip.
[01:49:24.350 --> 01:49:25.310]  I feel like sometimes…
[01:49:26.910 --> 01:49:28.350]  Steve has talked about this.
[01:49:28.350 --> 01:49:30.590]  Wendy just talked about it on Instagram.
[01:49:30.590 --> 01:49:32.430]  You guys are talking about it today.
[01:49:32.430 --> 01:49:36.670]  That's why I personally always like to have my isopods in the worm bins, breaking down
[01:49:36.670 --> 01:49:36.990]  stuff.
[01:49:38.670 --> 01:49:43.150]  There's a ton of different species that you can work with, but I personally would keep
[01:49:43.150 --> 01:49:47.790]  it to certain species if you're going to use that in your growing facility.
[01:49:49.630 --> 01:49:50.190]  Good advice.
[01:49:51.790 --> 01:49:52.350]  Yeah, I think our…
[01:49:52.350 --> 01:49:52.910]  Yeah, the roly-poly.
[01:49:52.910 --> 01:49:53.870]  …came on some compost.
[01:49:53.870 --> 01:49:54.590]  Yeah, they're a bitch.
[01:49:56.030 --> 01:49:57.950]  We just haven't really been able to get rid of them.
[01:49:58.670 --> 01:49:59.150]  Yep.
[01:49:59.150 --> 01:49:59.710]  Yeah, we've…
[01:49:59.710 --> 01:50:03.710]  The SC nematode seems to be effective on them to some degree.
[01:50:03.710 --> 01:50:05.710]  Nate's been having some success there.
[01:50:05.710 --> 01:50:08.270]  So, we're going to go down that road further and see how we do with that.
[01:50:11.230 --> 01:50:14.670]  So, you guys, you have hundreds of them per bed, thousands of them?
[01:50:14.670 --> 01:50:15.230]  I mean, is it…
[01:50:15.230 --> 01:50:16.270]  Thousands.
[01:50:16.270 --> 01:50:16.830]  Yeah.
[01:50:16.830 --> 01:50:17.470]  Thousands.
[01:50:17.470 --> 01:50:17.950]  Yeah.
[01:50:17.950 --> 01:50:18.990]  It depends what you have.
[01:50:18.990 --> 01:50:20.030]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:50:20.030 --> 01:50:20.990]  It's also true.
[01:50:20.990 --> 01:50:23.870]  Yeah, it's to the point, though, where we'll come into work and these things are crawling
[01:50:23.870 --> 01:50:24.670]  down the hallways.
[01:50:24.910 --> 01:50:26.750]  Hey, Nate, here's a little trick for you.
[01:50:27.790 --> 01:50:33.230]  Take some distiller's waste, not brewer's waste, distiller's waste, blend it with your
[01:50:33.230 --> 01:50:35.950]  compost and put those nematodes in there.
[01:50:35.950 --> 01:50:37.630]  They'll breed like crazy.
[01:50:37.630 --> 01:50:38.270]  And then you can…
[01:50:38.270 --> 01:50:39.230]  Oh, really?
[01:50:39.230 --> 01:50:41.390]  Yeah, so it's a way of growing them out.
[01:50:41.390 --> 01:50:42.510]  Might save you a few bucks.
[01:50:43.790 --> 01:50:45.630]  Hey, Mr. Gold Nuggets over there.
[01:50:45.630 --> 01:50:46.190]  Yeah.
[01:50:46.190 --> 01:50:46.750]  That's awesome.
[01:50:46.750 --> 01:50:47.230]  Yeah.
[01:50:47.230 --> 01:50:52.030]  That's good to know because these things, it seems to be a little bit more expensive
[01:50:52.110 --> 01:50:56.510]  That's good to know because these things, it seems to be somewhat effective so far,
[01:50:56.510 --> 01:51:00.190]  at least more than what we've seen in some other aspects of things.
[01:51:00.190 --> 01:51:04.830]  So it would be very beneficial to be able to kind of start farming those ourselves.
[01:51:05.390 --> 01:51:05.950]  There you go.
[01:51:05.950 --> 01:51:09.550]  We seem to be doing a lot in-house, so why not add that to the repertoire?
[01:51:10.510 --> 01:51:11.870]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:51:13.790 --> 01:51:14.190]  What?
[01:51:14.190 --> 01:51:15.710]  Hold on, wait, let me…
[01:51:16.990 --> 01:51:17.310]  Uh-oh.
[01:51:19.070 --> 01:51:20.670]  All right, say that again, Nate.
[01:51:21.630 --> 01:51:26.990]  I was just, I mean, as much as we can get out of our reliance, that's been my whole goal as
[01:51:28.110 --> 01:51:33.710]  kind of the thing behind driving my entire view of growing was just trying to get off
[01:51:33.710 --> 01:51:38.590]  reliance on other aspects of being as self-sustaining as possible.
[01:51:39.710 --> 01:51:46.270]  And yeah, so I mean, every little bit that we can do here, it saves us a shipping cost or
[01:51:47.070 --> 01:51:51.550]  a bill from having it shipped and having to pay someone to do it for us.
[01:51:51.550 --> 01:51:57.070]  And it's really, it's a lot more fulfilling to be able to kind of ground up,
[01:51:57.070 --> 01:51:59.310]  build everything and do most of it in-house.
[01:52:00.270 --> 01:52:02.430]  I feel like I get a lot more out of it.
[01:52:04.670 --> 01:52:10.510]  So there was a question about the trellis and when you guys harvest,
[01:52:10.510 --> 01:52:11.550]  do you cut it down?
[01:52:11.550 --> 01:52:12.350]  Do you leave it up?
[01:52:13.230 --> 01:52:18.640]  Yeah, they'll cut it out every harvest.
[01:52:18.640 --> 01:52:24.640]  If we have a few more layers that we don't use, we'll just kind of put it up next time.
[01:52:25.840 --> 01:52:29.280]  But yeah, they'll cut it out pretty much every, so every few,
[01:52:31.520 --> 01:52:34.960]  every few weeks there's people running around with some trellis around their neck,
[01:52:36.560 --> 01:52:37.920]  hanging it up all over the building.
[01:52:39.200 --> 01:52:43.200]  That just keeps things cleaner too if you guys just replace that and that's an obvious
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:45.120]  pretty minimal cost.
[01:52:45.120 --> 01:52:46.960]  It's one of those cost battles.
[01:52:47.920 --> 01:52:48.160]  Yeah.
[01:52:49.200 --> 01:52:54.720]  And you're starting soil, like for example, those beds that you had just filled up,
[01:52:54.720 --> 01:52:56.720]  what soil were you putting in there?
[01:53:01.130 --> 01:53:04.730]  I think as Evan mentioned earlier, we got it from a...
[01:53:06.970 --> 01:53:10.250]  Nate, could you get all that? My signal seems to be going off.
[01:53:10.250 --> 01:53:11.290]  They're called Viragro.
[01:53:11.850 --> 01:53:14.410]  They do a lot of the...
[01:53:15.130 --> 01:53:20.570]  I think one of the only ones supplying any sort of agricultural soils and stuff to the Vegas Valley.
[01:53:21.290 --> 01:53:23.930]  Sorry, what was the company name?
[01:53:26.090 --> 01:53:27.610]  It's called Viragro.
[01:53:27.610 --> 01:53:32.650]  They're a local place here and I believe somewhere in Southern California,
[01:53:32.650 --> 01:53:35.770]  they might have a sister company or something like that.
[01:53:36.090 --> 01:53:40.490]  But as far as I know, they're the only one that locally has...
[01:53:41.370 --> 01:53:43.850]  You can buy soil in the amounts that we need.
[01:53:46.810 --> 01:53:50.170]  Nice. And I saw a comment about the difference between
[01:53:50.170 --> 01:53:51.930]  brewer's waste and tiller's waste.
[01:53:52.490 --> 01:53:55.450]  Brewer's waste contains hops.
[01:53:55.450 --> 01:53:56.810]  The tiller's waste doesn't.
[01:53:56.810 --> 01:54:00.010]  And hops is known to be antimicrobial.
[01:54:00.010 --> 01:54:03.290]  So you are going to lose some of your diverse population.
[01:54:03.450 --> 01:54:07.050]  Yeah, that's why we don't put it in distillers.
[01:54:08.250 --> 01:54:09.130]  There's no hops in it.
[01:54:19.410 --> 01:54:20.690]  Yeah, they do.
[01:54:20.690 --> 01:54:24.610]  A lot of those spent grains go to animal feed.
[01:54:27.330 --> 01:54:30.050]  So here's a regulations question.
[01:54:30.050 --> 01:54:33.330]  Why don't you answer this from a regulatory standpoint?
[01:54:35.810 --> 01:54:37.250]  How much time you got, buddy?
[01:54:39.810 --> 01:54:41.570]  Are you guys allowed to go outside?
[01:54:43.330 --> 01:54:45.330]  So the answer to that is no.
[01:54:46.370 --> 01:54:47.090]  Yes and no.
[01:54:47.090 --> 01:54:50.530]  So nothing can be visible to the public's eye.
[01:54:51.330 --> 01:54:56.370]  So when all these facilities in 2014, when they made these laws in Nevada,
[01:54:57.490 --> 01:55:02.450]  I actually called the head of the program, a guy by the name of Chad Weston,
[01:55:02.450 --> 01:55:05.810]  back when it was under the Department of Health and Human Services.
[01:55:06.370 --> 01:55:07.970]  And the answer I got, because I asked him,
[01:55:08.530 --> 01:55:10.130]  why can't we use the sun to grow?
[01:55:10.850 --> 01:55:12.690]  Why can't we do outdoor grows?
[01:55:12.690 --> 01:55:16.210]  And the answer I got was you are not growing tomatoes.
[01:55:16.210 --> 01:55:17.570]  You are growing marijuana.
[01:55:17.570 --> 01:55:21.250]  And marijuana cannot be seen by the public's eye.
[01:55:21.250 --> 01:55:22.530]  We are very strict about that.
[01:55:22.530 --> 01:55:27.570]  Plus the security measures we want you to have is that this needs to be behind walls.
[01:55:28.370 --> 01:55:33.090]  And I asked him, okay, so if it's behind, let's say, a 12-foot wall,
[01:55:33.090 --> 01:55:35.010]  and nobody can see it from the street,
[01:55:35.010 --> 01:55:37.170]  if somebody flies over in a helicopter, is that...
[01:55:37.890 --> 01:55:39.010]  Are we out of compliance then?
[01:55:39.010 --> 01:55:40.130]  And the answer I got was yes.
[01:55:40.690 --> 01:55:43.330]  That cannot be seen from above or below.
[01:55:43.330 --> 01:55:45.090]  So that knocked out a lot of greenhouses.
[01:55:45.090 --> 01:55:47.010]  No one really did greenhouses early on.
[01:55:47.010 --> 01:55:52.370]  And in 2014, the majority of this industry, and you gotta remember also,
[01:55:52.370 --> 01:55:54.850]  we were applying for these licenses.
[01:55:54.850 --> 01:55:57.650]  Nobody knew if we were gonna get them or not.
[01:55:57.650 --> 01:55:59.570]  So it was like a big beauty competition.
[01:55:59.570 --> 01:56:02.130]  Everybody wanted to be compliant in the state's eyes,
[01:56:02.130 --> 01:56:03.490]  wanted to get these licenses.
[01:56:03.490 --> 01:56:05.650]  So everybody was basically forced indoors.
[01:56:07.010 --> 01:56:11.330]  As time has gone on, there are outdoor grows in Nevada.
[01:56:11.330 --> 01:56:14.610]  People have started to do them, but they're not...
[01:56:15.330 --> 01:56:18.370]  They're far and few between, and none have really seen success.
[01:56:19.330 --> 01:56:21.570]  So to answer that question, why don't we go out in the sun?
[01:56:21.570 --> 01:56:24.770]  Well, I mean, that would take us cutting a roof off of our building.
[01:56:26.210 --> 01:56:28.530]  And putting a glass roof on there.
[01:56:29.330 --> 01:56:31.250]  And even then, it would have to be opaque,
[01:56:31.250 --> 01:56:32.770]  because we have to be compliant with the state.
[01:56:32.770 --> 01:56:33.970]  Nobody can see into the building.
[01:56:35.810 --> 01:56:37.010]  I mean, let's be realistic.
[01:56:37.010 --> 01:56:38.290]  If the public could see that,
[01:56:38.290 --> 01:56:40.930]  you guys would have to have a whole different level of security.
[01:56:41.490 --> 01:56:41.990]  That too.
[01:56:42.530 --> 01:56:43.030]  Right?
[01:56:44.210 --> 01:56:44.710]  Yeah.
[01:56:45.490 --> 01:56:46.770]  We're right in the heart of Las Vegas.
[01:56:46.770 --> 01:56:49.330]  And then also you have the smell mitigation issue too.
[01:56:49.330 --> 01:56:50.690]  I mean, don't forget that.
[01:56:50.690 --> 01:56:53.490]  You can't be open and outdoors when you're in a city,
[01:56:53.490 --> 01:56:59.570]  because we have to keep the smell outside of this building to practically nothing.
[01:56:59.570 --> 01:57:03.330]  They actually have a tool that they go around with outside of these buildings
[01:57:03.330 --> 01:57:05.170]  and measure the smell coming out of them.
[01:57:05.170 --> 01:57:10.530]  And if you are exceeding that level, then you get a deficiency and you get fined.
[01:57:11.250 --> 01:57:12.050]  So I don't know how you...
[01:57:12.050 --> 01:57:13.330]  Some of those things are in the Expo.
[01:57:13.890 --> 01:57:14.390]  Yeah.
[01:57:15.010 --> 01:57:18.450]  I don't know how you would really control the smell if you're outdoors in the city.
[01:57:19.250 --> 01:57:21.170]  That would create a lot of problems too.
[01:57:21.170 --> 01:57:23.650]  They have that long nose looking thing, right?
[01:57:23.650 --> 01:57:25.490]  Is that the thing you're talking about?
[01:57:25.490 --> 01:57:25.990]  Yeah.
[01:57:25.990 --> 01:57:26.690]  It's weird.
[01:57:26.690 --> 01:57:27.190]  Yeah.
[01:57:27.190 --> 01:57:28.130]  They just walk around.
[01:57:28.290 --> 01:57:28.790]  Yeah.
[01:57:28.790 --> 01:57:29.290]  Pretty much.
[01:57:29.290 --> 01:57:29.790]  It's a sniffer.
[01:57:29.790 --> 01:57:33.330]  I forget the story about that, but it was invented for something else.
[01:57:33.330 --> 01:57:36.690]  And then it got passed over into the cannabis industry.
[01:57:37.090 --> 01:57:38.450]  But it's a funny story.
[01:57:38.450 --> 01:57:40.930]  I'm sorry I forget it, but I'll try to look back.
[01:57:41.890 --> 01:57:42.390]  But that's...
[01:57:42.390 --> 01:57:42.890]  Yeah.
[01:57:42.890 --> 01:57:45.090]  Like I said, that's a real thing and they really do that.
[01:57:45.090 --> 01:57:48.850]  So, you know, again, they're very strict here in Nevada.
[01:57:48.850 --> 01:57:53.250]  You know, we're held to a very high standard and we maintain compliance.
[01:57:53.250 --> 01:57:56.850]  We just actually had our first audit for 2021.
[01:57:57.570 --> 01:58:00.930]  And I'm proud to say that we had absolutely no deficiencies whatsoever.
[01:58:01.490 --> 01:58:05.730]  And that's on the health inspection then on the administrative audit.
[01:58:05.730 --> 01:58:06.930]  And that's tough to do.
[01:58:06.930 --> 01:58:11.490]  So, you know, not only are we growing great cannabis, but we're holding the standard here
[01:58:11.490 --> 01:58:12.210]  in Nevada.
[01:58:12.210 --> 01:58:15.570]  They want that gold standard and we're doing our best to uphold that.
[01:58:18.130 --> 01:58:21.810]  Now, when you guys are doing the edibles, I know like we kind of got a black eye here
[01:58:21.810 --> 01:58:27.010]  in Colorado because someone from, I believe it was the New York Times came to Colorado.
[01:58:27.010 --> 01:58:30.450]  Once everything came legalized, took an edible and freaked out.
[01:58:31.170 --> 01:58:34.210]  So do you guys have certain limits on that kind of stuff?
[01:58:34.210 --> 01:58:34.770]  Because...
[01:58:34.770 --> 01:58:35.330]  Yes.
[01:58:35.330 --> 01:58:35.650]  Yeah.
[01:58:35.650 --> 01:58:36.370]  So everything...
[01:58:37.010 --> 01:58:39.250]  And I think this is going to be the industry standard.
[01:58:39.250 --> 01:58:45.250]  Everything has to be in 10 milligram doses, basically, in, you know, servings.
[01:58:45.250 --> 01:58:51.170]  So if you're making a chocolate bar, that's 100 milligrams, you have to have 10, 10 milligram
[01:58:51.170 --> 01:58:52.850]  squares cut out in that chocolate.
[01:58:53.570 --> 01:58:57.650]  So I know that makes people upset, but in my opinion, for the general public, that is the
[01:58:57.650 --> 01:58:58.130]  way to go.
[01:58:58.130 --> 01:58:59.650]  I 100% agree.
[01:59:00.290 --> 01:59:00.770]  Yeah.
[01:59:00.770 --> 01:59:01.250]  Yeah.
[01:59:01.250 --> 01:59:04.450]  A thousand milligram bar, you could, you used to be able to get that here in Denver.
[01:59:05.250 --> 01:59:05.730]  Yes.
[01:59:05.730 --> 01:59:05.890]  Yeah.
[01:59:05.890 --> 01:59:10.770]  I don't know if you guys have ever taken a thousand milligrams, but that is, it is terrifying.
[01:59:10.770 --> 01:59:14.690]  We had the 500 milligram bar here and you can still get that actually in medical.
[01:59:15.730 --> 01:59:18.450]  But, you know, like I said, you have to have a medical card to get that.
[01:59:18.450 --> 01:59:23.970]  And that still has to be cut down into 10 milligram squares.
[01:59:23.970 --> 01:59:24.930]  So think about that.
[01:59:24.930 --> 01:59:25.810]  Some people need that.
[01:59:25.810 --> 01:59:26.770]  I want to be clear on that.
[01:59:26.770 --> 01:59:32.130]  I just don't want your average, you know, woo, I'm in Vegas person taking a 500,000.
[01:59:32.130 --> 01:59:37.650]  No, no, that's for, you know, that's a stage four cancer patient needs more than 100 milligrams
[01:59:37.650 --> 01:59:38.370]  per serving.
[01:59:38.370 --> 01:59:42.050]  So, you know, that's completely legit.
[01:59:42.050 --> 01:59:43.170]  There is a need for it.
[01:59:43.170 --> 01:59:46.610]  But like you said, you don't want tourists coming here doing that, you know, and in my
[01:59:46.610 --> 01:59:51.170]  eyes, that's been always been one of the big challenges for our industry is educating the
[01:59:51.170 --> 01:59:55.730]  public on, on edibles because, you know, that's the, I don't want to say the majority, but a
[01:59:55.730 --> 02:00:00.050]  lot of people are coming in and have never smoked before, never tried cannabis at all.
[02:00:00.050 --> 02:00:01.650]  And edible is their first experience.
[02:00:01.650 --> 02:00:05.090]  And they have a terrible experience because they eat too much and they never touch it again.
[02:00:05.090 --> 02:00:05.490]  Right.
[02:00:05.490 --> 02:00:07.570]  And so, you know, that, that happens quite a lot.
[02:00:07.570 --> 02:00:11.250]  And then on top of it, you hear all the horror stories that have happened with edibles and,
[02:00:11.250 --> 02:00:14.610]  you know, so yeah, but like everything has to be 10 milligrams.
[02:00:14.610 --> 02:00:15.730]  They are very strict about that.
[02:00:15.730 --> 02:00:19.650]  And even like a gummy and you also have to have it labeled 10 milligrams too.
[02:00:19.650 --> 02:00:20.850]  You have to have a stamp in there.
[02:00:20.850 --> 02:00:25.330]  So that creates a lot of problems for a lot of, you know, people producing out here is, you know,
[02:00:25.330 --> 02:00:28.450]  they want to do really cool different types of edibles, but you've got to be able to make sure
[02:00:28.450 --> 02:00:32.530]  you can get that stamp on it or you need to be able to wrap it so you can put that stamp on it.
[02:00:33.570 --> 02:00:38.770]  It has to say 10 milligrams and it also has to has the Nevada cannabis stamp on it.
[02:00:40.210 --> 02:00:41.170]  And that's another thing.
[02:00:41.170 --> 02:00:45.490]  I don't think a lot of the newer farmers, you know, newer viewers to the show realizes you
[02:00:45.490 --> 02:00:50.210]  boys not only have to know all of what you're doing day to day, but you need to understand,
[02:00:50.210 --> 02:00:53.650]  especially in some of these States, things are changing every week.
[02:00:53.650 --> 02:00:56.690]  Sometimes my first things come on board and then monthly.
[02:00:56.690 --> 02:01:00.450]  I've seen companies here in Colorado that put a lot of money into their marketing and that kind
[02:01:00.450 --> 02:01:04.610]  of stuff, the branding. And then the state came back and said, no, you got to add this sticker,
[02:01:04.610 --> 02:01:10.130]  this emblem. So all that stuff was useless. So, you know, hats off to you guys of also being on
[02:01:10.130 --> 02:01:13.650]  that side of things. And Evan, I think that comes back to your, you know, your business background
[02:01:13.650 --> 02:01:18.130]  is in Degar and I can attest to that here in Denver, you have to really know who's making
[02:01:18.130 --> 02:01:23.330]  the rules so that you can abide by them at your level because you have to protect your brand.
[02:01:23.890 --> 02:01:27.010]  Yeah, absolutely. These regulations are hundreds and hundreds of pages.
[02:01:27.010 --> 02:01:29.810]  Like you said, they change pretty regularly. You have to be on top of it.
[02:01:30.850 --> 02:01:35.090]  You know, that's if you want to do this legally, you have to be compliant and you have to know the
[02:01:35.090 --> 02:01:40.690]  regulations. It's really important for me, you know, and for me, it was a very natural progression
[02:01:40.690 --> 02:01:45.890]  coming out of the restaurant hospitality industry because I was actually the one at the restaurant
[02:01:45.890 --> 02:01:51.170]  that I was at. I worked at Treasure Island here on the strip for almost 15 years. And I was
[02:01:51.170 --> 02:01:55.570]  basically the guy that would meet with the health department where they would come and inspect our
[02:01:55.570 --> 02:02:01.010]  bar and our restaurant. So I got to learn, you know, really early on what it takes to pass health
[02:02:01.010 --> 02:02:06.370]  inspections here in Nevada and actually were inspected by the state. If you're in a restaurant
[02:02:06.370 --> 02:02:10.290]  in Clark County, you're actually inspected by the county and they're even tougher than the state.
[02:02:10.850 --> 02:02:15.650]  So, you know, it's like I said, it's a natural progression of coming out of that industry and
[02:02:15.650 --> 02:02:20.210]  understanding health code because in a cultivation facility, it's basically the exact same health
[02:02:20.210 --> 02:02:24.850]  code that you would have in a restaurant. Exactly. Very, very, very similar.
[02:02:24.850 --> 02:02:26.210]  And as it should be, you know.
[02:02:27.490 --> 02:02:28.050]  Absolutely.
[02:02:28.450 --> 02:02:31.330]  Dark secrets when Colorado first went legit.
[02:02:31.330 --> 02:02:35.090]  Yep. And, you know, that's another thing for Nate and I and Sven is that we've,
[02:02:35.090 --> 02:02:40.370]  we on all of our posts on Instagram, we put this little thing called show your grow.
[02:02:41.010 --> 02:02:44.530]  And we feel that, you know, there's a lot of people keeping secrets behind their doors and
[02:02:44.530 --> 02:02:49.970]  that's not us. I mean, as you can see, Nate just literally walked you through the entire garden and
[02:02:49.970 --> 02:02:54.770]  showed everything we have. We don't have anything to hide. And, you know, I think that that's really
[02:02:54.770 --> 02:02:58.850]  where this industry needs to move to, to get the trust of the public is, you know, to really
[02:02:58.850 --> 02:03:02.370]  understand what you're doing behind those doors. You don't really want to hide what you're doing.
[02:03:02.930 --> 02:03:03.650]  Show your grow.
[02:03:04.690 --> 02:03:05.810]  Yeah, I like that.
[02:03:06.770 --> 02:03:08.690]  The Eagles 20 up on the shelves.
[02:03:09.250 --> 02:03:10.930]  That's right. We don't have any of that.
[02:03:11.490 --> 02:03:15.890]  Well, the Living Soil people that will be talking and you'll see Clonex in the background.
[02:03:15.890 --> 02:03:17.250]  You're like, oh, okay.
[02:03:19.490 --> 02:03:24.450]  Yeah, nothing. And also, so we're also clean green certified. I don't know how much your
[02:03:24.450 --> 02:03:28.770]  audience knows about that, but that is the one. Okay. Yeah. So, I mean, that is the toughest
[02:03:28.770 --> 02:03:32.850]  certification to get. It's the most respected certification to get in cannabis and it's,
[02:03:32.850 --> 02:03:38.450]  you know, to be organically certified and man, no man, do they dig deep. They, they want to know
[02:03:38.450 --> 02:03:42.050]  literally every single thing in your building down to what you're cleaning your floors with.
[02:03:42.050 --> 02:03:44.850]  You know, what are you cleaning your scissors with everything they want to know at all.
[02:03:45.650 --> 02:03:50.050]  So I, you know, that to me, that clean green certification is a major badge of honor.
[02:03:50.610 --> 02:03:53.250]  There's not only do they want to know it, but they come in here and look to,
[02:03:53.250 --> 02:03:54.610]  they come and inspect your facility.
[02:03:55.890 --> 02:03:59.730]  And as a consumer, if I was flying into Vegas, you know, back in the day when I was living in
[02:03:59.730 --> 02:04:04.130]  Georgia, I had, you know, I want to come out and have some fun. That would definitely be one of the
[02:04:04.130 --> 02:04:08.050]  driving factors for me is to see that on your label or see something to the equivalent of that
[02:04:08.050 --> 02:04:13.410]  on your label. For sure. Yeah. Yeah. There's not many people doing it. I believe there's only two
[02:04:13.410 --> 02:04:17.570]  or three in the whole state, you know, that are growing in this method organically and, you know,
[02:04:17.570 --> 02:04:18.690]  getting that certification.
[02:04:19.410 --> 02:04:27.170]  So Nate, I want to know, whoa, it's a little reverb, but let me mute you while I ask the
[02:04:27.170 --> 02:04:34.450]  question. What, what plant or soil research have you been dorking out on recently or what,
[02:04:35.970 --> 02:04:42.530]  what things do you want to put into implementation that you've kind of been eyeing?
[02:04:43.330 --> 02:04:50.370]  I've really like very recently, I kind of went down the Bokashi tunnel.
[02:04:51.970 --> 02:04:59.010]  And I think it's very interesting in the sense of like traditional compost, like what you can
[02:04:59.010 --> 02:05:04.450]  and can't add to your pile. You know, there's always the do's and don'ts of traditional compost
[02:05:04.450 --> 02:05:07.810]  and like the idea of Bokashi, it's just like, yeah, screw it, throw it all in there.
[02:05:07.890 --> 02:05:14.050]  And so that's kind of where I know you've had him on before. Brandon Rust, he's one that me and him
[02:05:14.050 --> 02:05:20.530]  have talked a little bit over the last year, kind of become familiar with each other and a guy who
[02:05:20.530 --> 02:05:27.170]  I have an immense amount of respect for because he's an example of someone who's all motivation.
[02:05:27.170 --> 02:05:31.330]  It's just like this dude doesn't have a formal education in any of this stuff and he's diving
[02:05:31.330 --> 02:05:35.170]  into some of the deepest research and he's like, I'm going to do this. And I'm like,
[02:05:35.170 --> 02:05:38.290]  I'm not going to do this. And he's like, I'm not going to do this. And he's like, I'm not going to do this.
[02:05:38.290 --> 02:05:43.330]  And some of this stuff that drove me to look into the Bokashi was research papers that he actually
[02:05:43.330 --> 02:05:50.130]  had sent my way. So much love to Brandon for that. And I really appreciate him for sharing that
[02:05:50.130 --> 02:05:58.050]  with me because I think it really opened the door to us with this kind of new style of composting.
[02:05:58.450 --> 02:06:05.410]  As I said, the ferment, when I collect that stuff, I'm still using a batch that I made over a year
[02:06:05.410 --> 02:06:10.370]  ago. So a lot of the stuff that we're doing was either taken out of the garden to be composted
[02:06:10.370 --> 02:06:17.170]  and reapplied. And so the whole, the Bokashi kind of theory that I'm working on now, or we're working
[02:06:17.170 --> 02:06:22.850]  on as a whole is to be able to chop and drop everything, little sprinkle of Bokashi and kind
[02:06:22.850 --> 02:06:31.090]  of do a composting, I would say alternative slash kind of thing going on just on the surface soil,
[02:06:31.090 --> 02:06:38.370]  on the surface of our bed. And so that is kind of the new, that's where my focus has been recently,
[02:06:38.370 --> 02:06:46.210]  as far as kind of dialing in that and making that feasible to do in our garden on the scale that
[02:06:46.210 --> 02:06:49.890]  we're doing it. And I actually think it's going to make it much, much easier than what we were
[02:06:49.890 --> 02:06:57.890]  doing. So kind of the whole Bokashi train is where my, I would say the educational focus
[02:06:57.890 --> 02:06:59.250]  has been the last few weeks.
[02:07:02.880 --> 02:07:07.520]  All right, we definitely, Leighton and myself, we echo that. We actually reached out to Mr. Russ,
[02:07:07.520 --> 02:07:13.600]  and he's one of our keynote speakers for our talk, February 27th and 28th. We definitely
[02:07:13.600 --> 02:07:19.200]  think that he is onto stuff. I personally like his backstory. I was talking to him a few years ago
[02:07:19.200 --> 02:07:24.320]  when he had just gotten released, that kind of stuff. And it's the hunger that that guy has,
[02:07:24.320 --> 02:07:29.360]  it's contagious for the community. So hats off to you, Nate, for always giving, you know, I really
[02:07:29.360 --> 02:07:34.080]  like when people give credit where credit's due. So hats off to you on both sides of that, brother.
[02:07:34.880 --> 02:07:40.000]  Yeah, I'm extremely like, I look at him and it's just like, I went down some of these rabbit holes
[02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:47.680]  as, you know, being kind of having that background, the biomechanics and biochemistry background. And
[02:07:47.680 --> 02:07:53.120]  it's just like to watch this dude who's really got not the formal education and to dive into this
[02:07:53.120 --> 02:07:57.360]  stuff on the level he's doing it is just, it's nothing but impressive. And I got nothing but
[02:07:57.360 --> 02:08:03.680]  respect for what he's doing out there in Oklahoma. It's great to see. Echoed, yeah. I mean, there's
[02:08:03.680 --> 02:08:08.080]  certain people I feel like, I feel like Stevens comes to mind when there were certain game changers,
[02:08:08.080 --> 02:08:12.240]  people that I feel like four or five years ago that were really putting things out there.
[02:08:12.240 --> 02:08:16.800]  And then I feel like, you know, as we continue on, Mr. Russ is definitely on that path as well.
[02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:26.000]  Agreed, for sure. He's a great kid. Doing the work. And I like your idea of just composting
[02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:31.440]  right there at the base of the plant. I mean, how much less work, right? Sprinkle a little bit of
[02:08:31.440 --> 02:08:37.360]  Akashi right on the droppings and off you go. And what was happening was we were actually
[02:08:37.360 --> 02:08:42.720]  attracting a lot of flies. Our piles just out in the summer here, it gets so hot and it's just a
[02:08:42.720 --> 02:08:48.720]  breeding ground for flies and stuff. So it was really becoming more of a hassle to make good,
[02:08:48.720 --> 02:08:56.160]  rich compost. And then to reapply it is like, I feel like we're getting a much more economically,
[02:08:56.160 --> 02:09:02.880]  our, our Bokashi goes far more farther than what our compost would do. We would have tons and tons
[02:09:02.880 --> 02:09:07.600]  of waste shrink down to a tiny little bit of compost to where it wouldn't even really be
[02:09:07.600 --> 02:09:13.360]  making a big impact on the bed that we were adding it to. It was such a minuscule amount that
[02:09:14.320 --> 02:09:20.000]  it's just kind of one of those things that it sounded good, but it really wasn't working well
[02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:25.680]  in the application aspect of it. So the whole Bokashi thing was just something that I had heard
[02:09:25.680 --> 02:09:31.040]  about and never really looked into. And I'm glad that I was kind of pushed in that direction
[02:09:31.040 --> 02:09:38.240]  because I think that it's really going to be, change a lot of how the efficiency of how we're
[02:09:38.240 --> 02:09:43.120]  working here and increase the soil fertility. Like, I mean, all that nutrition just going right
[02:09:43.120 --> 02:09:50.800]  back in there immediately. Exactly. It's going to get blown up in smoke. Literally. And no flies.
[02:09:53.600 --> 02:09:55.200]  Amen. No flies on this boy.
[02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:59.200]  Yeah. Do we have some more questions, Peter?
[02:09:59.200 --> 02:10:03.280]  It was like, we were getting these things just nasty. We had these totes and bins that we were
[02:10:03.280 --> 02:10:07.840]  doing indoors and it would still be just like, where are they coming from? And it ended up just
[02:10:07.840 --> 02:10:12.800]  being, we were fighting, we had sticky traps covered. I mean, it was just pepper all over
[02:10:12.800 --> 02:10:17.760]  with flies. And so we, we steered away from that pretty quickly and kind of back to the drawing
[02:10:17.760 --> 02:10:22.560]  board. And luckily the Bokashi kind of stood out to us. So that's our next step.
[02:10:22.560 --> 02:10:25.600]  That's the next project we're going to tackle and try and dial in.
[02:10:25.600 --> 02:10:27.840]  Sounds like a plan. Really good plan.
[02:10:28.720 --> 02:10:32.000]  I think that's a probably a good wrapping point.
[02:10:34.240 --> 02:10:38.720]  Right on guys. Well, like I said, man, we really appreciate this. I feel like it's next level when
[02:10:38.720 --> 02:10:45.920]  you can show in real time, living soil at scale with a minimal crew and the production that you're
[02:10:46.880 --> 02:10:52.000]  doing. It's A to Z. And that's, I feel like the whole community, that's where we would love to be.
[02:10:52.880 --> 02:10:54.800]  Yeah. Huge ups, you guys. Huge ups.
[02:10:54.800 --> 02:10:57.280]  Thank you. And we appreciate it greatly.
[02:10:57.280 --> 02:11:00.000]  I look forward to visiting the facility someday.
[02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:04.480]  Yes. Please make it out here. Yeah. We'd be happy to give you a tour.
[02:11:04.480 --> 02:11:09.360]  We're late and we can do the car road trip one of these days.
[02:11:09.360 --> 02:11:11.680]  Absolutely. Yeah. You guys, you're going to be great.
[02:11:11.680 --> 02:11:14.640]  You're going to be number one on the stop before I get to LA.
[02:11:14.640 --> 02:11:18.400]  Awesome. Yeah. And we're right in the heart of the city too, man. So yeah,
[02:11:18.400 --> 02:11:20.960]  you can stay at the Bellagio and be here in five minutes.
[02:11:20.960 --> 02:11:23.440]  All right. Now that's living.
[02:11:23.440 --> 02:11:27.840]  Yeah. So just quickly, some housekeeping.
[02:11:27.840 --> 02:11:31.360]  I know we've been talking about this for a while, but I just wanted to make sure that
[02:11:31.360 --> 02:11:33.840]  we're getting this right. I know we're getting this right.
[02:11:33.840 --> 02:11:35.520]  We're getting this right. We're getting this right.
[02:11:35.520 --> 02:11:36.320]  Now that's living.
[02:11:39.280 --> 02:11:44.400]  So just quickly, some housekeeping. I don't know if he's still watching,
[02:11:45.280 --> 02:11:50.320]  and this is a tough act to follow up, but Chad Westport was going to do a garden tour tonight
[02:11:51.600 --> 02:11:58.320]  when his lights are on at 10. It's a much more humble scale grow operation.
[02:11:59.280 --> 02:12:06.800]  He's up in Washington state. And then what's today? Yeah, that's about all I can remember
[02:12:06.800 --> 02:12:12.880]  as of now, but hopefully my parents are still tuned in two hours and 12 minutes later in this
[02:12:12.880 --> 02:12:19.520]  Rhode Island snow right now. Mom and dad, I love you and welcome to my world.
[02:12:23.840 --> 02:12:26.160]  I think this is the first video they've watched.
[02:12:26.160 --> 02:12:29.920]  Well, hopefully they're not shoveling that shit. Hopefully they got someone to do it for them.
[02:12:29.920 --> 02:12:37.360]  Yes. My brother is at their house right now babysitting his two small daughters as well
[02:12:37.360 --> 02:12:43.680]  as his two elderly parents. So Michael, shout out. He's doing tech support for my dad's computer.
[02:12:43.680 --> 02:12:51.920]  He's listening to my mom rant about politics. He's watching a two-year-old and a one-year-old
[02:12:51.920 --> 02:12:56.000]  throw stuff all over the floor because his babysitter did not show up today.
[02:12:57.840 --> 02:13:03.440]  Big ups to Michael. I want to give a quick shout out to the Soda Boys out at
[02:13:04.400 --> 02:13:09.360]  Dreamin' Farms. They are our guests next week. They are also going to show us behind the scenes,
[02:13:09.920 --> 02:13:12.800]  but on a hemp farm and at scale commercial.
[02:13:14.800 --> 02:13:20.000]  Oh, and you guys had mentioned Microbe Alchemist earlier, and actually a whole
[02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:27.920]  bunch of his seeds are arriving either today or tomorrow. They're up on the website, but he's been
[02:13:27.920 --> 02:13:36.640]  shipping from the East Coast and consolidating all the bean shipments. We are fans. And also,
[02:13:36.640 --> 02:13:40.560]  it's funny to watch him too. He's got a lot of funny drama that goes on on Instagram.
[02:13:40.640 --> 02:13:41.760]  We can crack this up.
[02:13:43.200 --> 02:13:44.480]  The world is crazy.
[02:13:46.960 --> 02:13:48.480]  So anyway, all right. With that,
[02:13:50.400 --> 02:13:56.560]  Leighton, I'm sure you're going to go outside and enjoy that 75-degree California sunshine.
[02:13:57.360 --> 02:14:01.040]  I hope to. The wind finally died down. Boy, it was blowing hard last night.
[02:14:02.560 --> 02:14:06.000]  The winds have been crazy for the past two days or so.
[02:14:06.800 --> 02:14:07.760]  Here too in Vegas.
[02:14:08.720 --> 02:14:11.680]  Yeah, weird weather, guys. Really weird. My buddy-
[02:14:11.680 --> 02:14:13.280]  It's snowing here. It's cold as hell.
[02:14:13.280 --> 02:14:17.920]  It's snowing. I don't know. No such thing as extreme weather, right?
[02:14:18.720 --> 02:14:20.480]  Right. All right.
[02:14:20.480 --> 02:14:20.960]  Thanks, guys.
[02:14:20.960 --> 02:14:28.800]  So with that, let's wrap it up and everybody get on to your day. You guys got some plants to water.
[02:14:31.120 --> 02:14:32.880]  Thank you guys so much. That was a really-
[02:14:32.880 --> 02:14:33.840]  Nice to meet you, Nate.
[02:14:34.880 --> 02:14:36.160]  Yeah, nice to meet both of you.
[02:14:36.800 --> 02:14:39.520]  Yeah, it was great. Thank you very much. I don't know if Nate's still on or not.
[02:14:39.520 --> 02:14:40.400]  It looks like he froze up.
[02:14:40.400 --> 02:14:41.680]  He's there, but he's-
[02:14:41.680 --> 02:14:43.120]  He's there. I muted him.
[02:14:43.120 --> 02:14:44.240]  Okay. Okay.
[02:14:44.240 --> 02:14:49.200]  Very, very nice. I'm glad you guys had me. I really appreciate you guys inviting me on here.
[02:14:50.240 --> 02:14:51.360]  Absolutely.
[02:14:51.360 --> 02:14:55.840]  And that goes for me too. It's a real pleasure and we'd be happy to do it again anytime.
[02:14:55.840 --> 02:14:57.360]  Awesome. For sure.
[02:14:57.360 --> 02:14:58.400]  Thanks, guys.
[02:14:58.400 --> 02:14:59.840]  All right. Thank you.
