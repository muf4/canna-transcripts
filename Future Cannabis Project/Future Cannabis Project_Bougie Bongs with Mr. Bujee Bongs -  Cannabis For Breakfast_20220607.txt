Hello everybody and welcome to another episode of Cannabis for Breakfast. We
have a little bit of a later start today because we have an amazing
guest here that's visiting in person because this is our first in live on
location video here in the garden. As you can see I've got my head cranked looking
at the laptop and I've got my glorious guest here with some glorious bongs, lots
of flower and lots of great stuff happening. So we're gonna get into the
conversation in a moment and get it started right now but we'd like to first
thank our sponsor Greenamber.ca, the Cadillac of Lighting Canada. If you

we appreciate your support and again we are here with Trevor Ball. Welcome!
Thank you sir! Welcome brother. First let's start because we've actually managed to start off our day with a nice
lemonade. Make sure your microphone is on for me. It is on sir, we're good. Cheers brother, cheers!
Welcome to a day. So what are we drinking on? We are drinking on some honey and
lemon with a little bit of a flower. I'm not sure why I'm explaining this. I know I wanted to.
So I made the cocktail so I could go up in the zone in here and you guys can have a peek at that. We are
cheersing away here and we have French lemonade, so fizzy lemonade with infused
honey and a little bit of weed leaf for garnish. So we are indulging and enjoying
our beautiful day here. We are. I am just switching it over so I can see you. It's
not quite breakfast anymore. I know it's a little bit later in the day but you
know what, who cares. We got a lot of guests. Why not? Breakfast all day. And what does breakfast
actually mean? Really does is breakfast eggs and bacon and hash browns or is it
lemonade drinks infused with honey? Exactly. Well it depends on the person.
Depends on the person. I'm more of a lemonade infused with honey type of guy. There you go. You gotta love the mustache getting in the way when you're having a
Oh always. It always happens but I never seem to have that case. Well lucky we got
a cool piece here so we're gonna get into that in a second but before we
start getting into the consumption, I mean we're already consuming now, before we
start getting into consumption why don't you tell me a little bit about you and
and what you're doing and like why the fuck are you here? Well why I'm here is I
was graciously invited on by yours truly as after we met at the, where did we meet?
The summit? Yes we met at the summit. Yes I was on your live like instantly there
one of the first time when we were on there and what I do is I am an actual
creative artist. I'm a photographer by career and then I started to try a
little bit different some different things out and use my creativity and see
where it goes and I created Mr. Bougie Bong two years ago and it would have
been around my birthday two years ago and it was kind of a cool idea that I've
been thinking about for a minute but finalized finally in two years ago where
I seek out vintage or antique rare one-of-a-kind decanters or bottles that
are usually Italian glass or handmade or hand-blown from back in the day dating
back from 1900 to probably my newest piece is 1975 and I repurpose them into
bongs. It could be a dab rig, could be a flower bong, could be a bubbler and it
could be even a bong with a whip. So I just like to see that vintage glass it's
still really popular still really cool looking that you see on your Nana's
shelf or your your parents shelf and you see it sitting there not being used it
is collecting dust so why not give it another life and still keep the vintage
antique look. Absolutely stunning just really cool piece we're gonna hit that
in a second but I want you to try something I've got something special I
want you to try because I don't often get to have no this is not gonna probably
fit that piece. Might be a little bit big. Oh that is. I want to bring that guy over and we're gonna hit it on the little blue tube down below for you and then we're gonna hit that one in a second but I wanted to show you this because we got this really fun vape. Let's try this oh it's a vape attached to a whip
attached to a bong. So this is in my interpretation one of the funnest, cleanest ways. Yeah
in for a treat it's my hodgepodge. In for a treat out with a bang. Out for a bang so go
ahead brother. All right here we go. You'll need to do a couple rips as it
heats the flower up but it's I think it's the cleanest way to smoke weed so
whenever I happen to get the opportunity to have a guest here and actually consume
in my way and show them how I consume it's always really exciting for me. Already
tastes super clean I can taste I can taste the weed. Yeah it's not like yeah
it's a nice day and it's not like coffee it's not like when you get all coffee
and you're chasing up your lung because that's one of the things that I
find especially when you run a whip through a vape is like you kill your
lungs in the process don't you like really gets you. Hey going good. It'll
it'll chafe out pretty quick which is kind of the fun part. Wow is that ever clean.
The seal's a little loose go for it. Boom. Now I can't wait to hit your piece.
Now that you've had mine. That is so great that's so smooth and like every bong's different of
course this one's got a nice percolator on it so it's for the you know for a little basic bong by
boss glass it's still a good bong to hit that kind of stuff with because they're
made for it almost. Well then this is the stoners dream the stoners atmosphere is
we we got to put weed in the bong before we smoke it. Why am I why am I not
smoking any smoke. All right round two let's take some more deep breaths.
Put any weed in the f*****g thing. One two three let's do it. I can actually see the
vapor coming through a lot clearer now there you go nice and hot now and you can pull the
tip like the like a bong like you would normally and like I think this is the cleanest way to smoke.
That's fantastic. Even better when there's weed in it.
Yes. It's very fun it hits a lot harder than people expect it to what it's like. Well that's
it's not the fact that it hits harder it really doesn't it's just a fact of as as bong people
or people that smoke weed or the enthusiasts you have to get used to whatever you're smoking.
If you hit different things all the time like myself because I have to test all these pieces
of mine they're all different so I never get used to anything except for possibly my own at home
but that doesn't travel too far because it's pretty delicate. No it's hard to move glass around.
I was like how is he going to strategically move this glass from Victoria down to here because you
busted ass from over from Victoria today you were not like a local in North Vancouver you made a
serious effort to come see me here. Yes I know I was serious over for serious people you know
but yes I made it over from Victoria I live downtown in the artist district in Chinatown
and yeah I wanted to be on the show it's a beautiful day so why not make a nice little
favor right over and enjoy some cannabis. You've grown weed you've been an artist for a long time
what was kind of your first medium like because I imagine it probably wasn't bongs that what this
wasn't the one you jumped into you mentioned that you were an artist before and with photograph.
Yeah so I've always been into the arts I've always been fun in that area coming from my
mother she was a cartoon drawer and book writer so I kind of got a little bit for her creativity
and then I got my dad's handiness my dad's pretty handy at a lot of things so I finally
started putting two together and after I did my little stint in the military for seven years
I became a photographer and I've been doing that for 10 years and that's where I started and then
that kind of boomed me into a lot of different areas as in like movies and being an extra then
shooting for movies and then getting into selling prints and then going to the more art area instead
of just being you know a photographer for money like shooting weddings all the time and something
like that I did shoot weddings but you know not my thing anymore but in the time I noticed I had
other abilities I had abilities to help with different things so I was like I've helped
produce music videos I've helped with short films so it's like I use a lot of my creativity so
I actually changed actually two years ago from just Trevor Ball photography to Trevor Ball
creative and because I have so many different avenues and so many different things I do I
I build custom bikes for people I make custom bongs for people and I even go the route of
with the bong thing I even go the route of you know asking the clients or customers for a picture
of their living room see what they're like if they have their own place you know and see what
their atmosphere is like and then I will actually try and match something to their atmosphere so I
go the extra mile instead of just you know you know somebody buying a piece that's pretty cool
you know and it might not sit well in their place so I like to have it so well but most of the pieces
that people buy they do sit well in uh in their places well I mean that's kind of a there's there's
two forms of artistry really and when it comes down to there's like functional artistry which you are
but there's also like the artistry where hey am I going to is my plan to create something that
people want or am I just going to do my art and and not have an avenue for sale right and they
hope people appreciate it and and while both routes are awesome I think you need to be a little bit in
in today's world diverse with those decisions right I definitely think you have to have a little
bit of both like you need to be the gusto and just do what you want to do yes money is an issue we
all get it money uh controls a lot of things that we do and it's hard not to think about that when
you know you have your monthly bills and rent and all that stuff but you know it's like everything
is made of money so it's always going to be there um so if you try and do the love of your craft
and then spread that passion towards other people I think people in this day and age they invest
in people's passions and creative creative creative atmospheres they do they don't people
I think on average they're moving away from the traditional easy corporate now don't get me wrong
Amazon makes things easy and I'm not trying to market for them so we're not going to say the
name again because I usually try and avoid it but I like large corporate business makes things easy
it's easy to go on your phone and order something and purchase something I get it get it you know
and I get it and I totally get that but like we culture as a society is moving towards smaller
business like everybody most of our viewers most people I know in general they want to purchase
off of their friend they don't want to purchase off of some stranger they don't want to purchase
like art or things that are made out of nowhere they want a relationship I think the fact of like
the friends and family and the people around you want to invest into your atmosphere where you're
growing and creating a good art for them and it's local instead of you know investing into a person
you know like one person having over a hundred billion dollars worth
like what's the point of you investing into that they're already wealthy
yeah exactly like they're already it's not the fact that we're looking for wealth we're just
looking for um equality of life security you know we're looking for that confidence where
everybody just wants to feel comfortable and not have to worry about things but really we gotta
like I think it's a lot about getting lost in that in the process but you have to make some
sacrifices too so it's like you can't have everything no you can't as an artist or a
creative you do have to sacrifice some things you know I mean like I sacrificed a vehicle for
six seven years because um living downtown and not having to pay hundreds of dollars thousands
of dollars to own a vehicle for a while then I can invest into my craft you know I mean it's not too
hard though I did drive here today with an evo and that is very convenient they make it a lot easier
sorry that's not a plug but uh not a plug for evo but if you but like if it's a local license
if you uh come to London show get one of those cars and come here yeah there you go if you're
in the area because I know there's people that's been wanting to come for a visit and the door is
always open here in the studio as well as in general and there's always something to consume
as well so you know you have to make decisions and compromise but you also get to have fun with
your artwork right exactly um and you get to get that's the main thing have fun the whole time
yeah the whole time you try to but like okay so there's some oh what's probably the oldest
piece that you've worked on 1900 1900 glass doesn't last very long does it it's very hard
to get old of really old vintage vintage anything like prior to that uh right yeah prior to 1900
it's pretty rare and it's usually going to be more um there's going to be glass yes but it's
going to be more rare as it's going to be probably more ceramic and pottery um clay yeah like like
claws and stuff like that exactly so it's a little bit more yeah a little bit concrete maybe
but uh I wouldn't do some concrete but um but like ceramic and pottery still really cool but the
only thing I a little bit worried about the pottery is um the dust or the porous material so
I don't know if that's really healthy to indulge through even though it's just smoke passing through
it and water in it but it does the water does soak into it oh yeah because you're gonna have
there you go and then it probably a little bit harder to clean as well also true so you know
and it's it's you're kind of you kind of it's kind of brilliant because you're doing exactly what
I've always thought of doing is like can I smoke out of that you know every single person I think
that has consumed cannabis on a regular basis at a good level has been like oh can I you look at
anything you look at anything you look at a bicycle and be like can I always smoke weed through that
thing and then you go okay stuff weed in one hand of the handlebars and you put your mouth on the
other hand of course you have I mean you've done some unique pieces so let's talk about this piece
and taking it off of it while we're while we're here right yeah so this is actually I haven't
even dated this I'm going to look at this right now I haven't did it's 1968 so there you go uh
most of the pieces if not all of them I will do extensive research where I know the year the
history of it or they will all be stamped so they're a legit piece um so it's 1968 this is a
little cast iron stove and uh is it like one of those ones you get for Christmas for like incense
and stuff like that or is it like was it like a functioning no this is a functioning decanter
for alcohol back in the day so this would probably be some type of straight Kentucky whiskey or
whiskey so I do apologize for the people if there is any leftover I do dump it out I don't
save it I also don't drink so whatever you get vinegar in half the stuff yeah exactly it's yeah
but it would last but it would evaporate I imagine through it of course yeah it's it's going to be
high content yeah it's going to evaporate so uh I did pair it up I did like the red um glow off
the fireplace so I want to pair it up with like a reddish brown uh orange piece with a nice opal
uh and this is by Gazi Glass in Victoria which his name is Michael
and uh you can find him through some of my recent posts
there you go thank you sir
yeah so we're gonna we're gonna hit that well I'm gonna hit it yeah you're gonna hit it and I'm gonna
put some dusties yeah I'm gonna give you a little topper of uh some dry little dusty
just to go wow it's a bit you just fucking pour it on yeah no we don't go light here you come over
I guess so we we're consuming cannabis for breakfast
so this is an old cork so this is still the cork and still snug fit and that's the cap did you have
to clean it or anything because sometimes they get oh of course so I had that was that was
that was like yeah like rye or something yeah probably interesting interesting
yeah it's funny how it still distinctly smells in there you know you let it soak forever
like I let that cork soak for probably about almost a week like yeah that's definitely like
I smell like like Canadian rye almost like I feel like some stuff like and this looks almost very
prairie to me you know I know it looks like maybe like it could be from like Manitoba or Saskatchewan
exactly it could be from it could totally be a prairie thing people used to do but you know
that means that there was a lot of stuff that came over the border well I'm gonna have a sip of this
nice little lemon drink cheers this is so delicious not bad eh and the garnish on top
exquisite well if you got weed leaves around you might as well use it for garnish all right so let
me uh put the mic down and I'll uh I'll hit this on camera one second
while he's doing that I'll give a little shout out because we got the Guerrero Grow Show going
on the other channel but we also have a lot of other fun things going on here
and later today like later today we have future cat we have the Dankour on channel two
with uh our usual friends but we have an awesome pair coming to join us a white rabbit
and they are David and I forget the other name but David is coming from White Rabbit as well
as their chef to join us for an awesome conversation this evening and the Dankour
with the usual experts and we'll be talking about their awesome they have this beautiful gummy and
really something above and beyond what I usually get to see in this space I've never been like a
person that's been a big gummy guy that's been like oh yeah gummies are bad are really the the
direction to go a matter of fact when we decided to do the chef segment in uh the Dankour we
decided that maybe it would be smarter um to avoid the sweet end because there's just it's just kind
of boring for us um but that being said I found something so special and so different that I had
to share it with the community that was a hard one with the with the with the key font up I really
loaded you up I'm sorry what are you talking about that was fantastic I piled that on I put like it
was pretty sticky on top there I pressed it down it's like oh my god he put a nugget on like no no
that's just sticky it's it's first first screen sieve so it's like it's a little bit waxy and it's
definitely got some some stick stick less less more stick less hair well there you go so well
the you know what let me tell you the bong works the bog definitely does work so we are smoking on
what was it pink cush the stuff that we're yeah oh the weeds oh uh pink panties pink panties
pink panties we won't we won't market the the company but pink panties is what an interesting
name people like do you think that works well for marketing forwards women do you think that's like
their goal um well honestly if you if you go to a recent post on my my mr boucher bong you will see
I have not just only uh showing off some women and some men in uh pink panties in a recent story post
so good luck so far they're still like a little bit weird though so why don't you tell me
kind of like I'm gonna ask that question to the microphone so why don't you tell me a little bit
about the industry from your perspective we've been in an interesting space in canon the fact
that we've become legal and you're in the accessory space which is very interesting
and a little bit more fun and well angled anyways to have fun in this beast in industry and so I
would love to kind of know what what it's like what the transition was like for someone who is
creating an accessory product and how that's looking for you in the future um future is good
uh I just like to live in the present but um the industry has
give me one moment the industry has come a long way uh since legalization I did have a good
legalization party I had about 40 people over and we boxed my apartment that was a good time
uh that was actually the same time we had industry night and uh Chong was in town from Cheech and Chong
he was uh just muddling about but anyways good times but I think it's gone pretty good so far but
yeah it's beautiful yeah that is uh it's not a really nice really like you usually worry about
these big pieces and they have like being chuggers or they like take a lot of work and that's like a
really like you really got the pipe angle well in that like you know that if you look down the hole
there no I didn't have too much of a gander uh yeah look down there
yeah so this is a 14 mil glass uh stem that's 14 mil slim still with slits and hold the end
so it's a little bit smoother with a bigger volume piece that's how I feel that when you
see more of a just a ball or just an area I think you need some drawback a little bit so that's why
that slim stem is real nice it's it's cool man it's one of the funkiest pieces I've ever gotten
to consume off of I am at an interesting state right now and people will find out a lot more
detail about this very soon and we'll get into that a little bit more but I recently uh became
a landowner in Italy oh which is very interesting so we have uh about an acre of farmland
in southern Italy in the region of Puglia um and we are tremendously excited about it because
we're actually going to put up a regenerative farm there wow and and try and move out there
we're still laying it laying down the time so everybody will get living the dreams of most
yeah well you know the cost of living here is so high it's a lot cheaper out there it's like a
thousand bucks a month so I can do this and get to spend my days with the community and supporting
the community and doing this and and being part of it and just do it over there you know like
I'm a good person anyways the the shows are done online so it's very easy won't have to stop or
change anything which is great so I'm getting married next Sunday well we'll get married this
Sunday we're doing the paperwork but we actually have a wedding coming up we're actually going to
do a cool wedding I am excited for you guys yes I met Adele with two L's 20 minutes ago or whatever
and uh she's a pleasant person so I could see why she is I am blessed to have the family that I have
we were like we're kind of doing a shotgun quick wedding so and we want to do like a bigger one
later in Italy at some point but we don't want to rush into it you know we want to have some money
and do like the grand you know I think a lot of people nowadays are just like doing like more of
an elopement with close I mean then they just have like a reception and then just like come
party and have a good time exactly right like like don't put too much pressure on it so that's what
we're going to do and we're actually going to do this ceremony and and our first session live
on future cannabis project we're going to stream it I'm a fucking idiot eight I don't know I think
that would be kind of some people would tune in for that I think I think I hope everybody would
tune in for that you know I I that's that's the goal and excitement point is that everybody does
get to tune in for it and join me for that moment in my life because it's like we're going to do the
big one anyways it's going to be hers so it's like let's do a weed wedding like like I got tons of
flower we'll have tons of flowers and we'll use them to line the areas where she walks to
well like I've got a few weed plants that are getting like you can see down there on the table
there which we'll go for a little tour later yeah I got about I got about three and a half footers
that I have just done a whole bunch of training and cut them down so that they're focusing all
their energy on the top and we're going to have a nice big big like big huge round beautiful plants
as like at the end of the aisle and stuff like that and do the whole thing weed style that's
pretty enjoyable yeah man oh as you did notice I am wearing my uh broccoli socks broccoli socks
from uh that good store bell general in victoria nice yeah love that store so exciting um that's
it's so what's it like being on the island because I mean there's people don't really
recognize this as well as they should I think all over the world but Vancouver Island's like
kind of a cannabis space isn't it uh like some of the best weed on the planet comes from this
island or comes from my island or not my island but the island that I live on I live in Victoria
which is like the biggest city on the island uh you know and it's south so we're pretty close to
the states like I can see Port Angeles from at the end of my road so I just have to I just have
to ride straight and it goes right to the ocean and then I can see Port Angeles straight across
there's a ferry you know it's not too far but um it's kind of it's definitely more relaxed
it's a slower slower life it's a slower decisions slower change slower everything
it's like a couple years behind everywhere else like bigger cities and we're like the capital of
bc yeah it's kind of so it's kind of like weird it's like people don't even know where Victoria
is but they know Vancouver for sure but Vancouver's got two million people yeah and the
great low mainland I think is at 2.9 now if you count the outer regions a little bit too that's
true that's true which is funny and downtown core Victoria is like probably like maybe like 250,000
now it's a beautiful little like artsy town there's that center area I used to go there to
visit the hotels and stuff to sell croissants and shit um it was it's like it's its own because like
when people come to Victoria they're like they're going let's go to Victoria let's have a good time
it's like no no no you got the wrong thing you got the wrong thing you come to Victoria to do
nothing like Victoria is like the ultimate relaxation like you know what come here for
fucking four or five days get a spa and relax it's like take your mind off stuff grab a coffee
wander around check out some local stuff almost every street is mainly locally owned
there's only like four or five chains kind of like on those streets of like yeah down core
there's a ton of there's a ton of like really special little like like eight seaters yeah that
that you go in and there's like no menu you know and it's just like you get food they really do
there is something special that's kind of an energy that's happening out there and it is a
core of the cannabis of the cannabis culture it is when it comes to BC I mean a lot of the a lot
of the off smaller islands like Texada and Galeano, Gabriella like all of these little islands a lot
of them were established by cannabis grower growing communities and that's how they made
their living they live on the island and and live a private life and and grow their cannabis and
it's grown quite a bit and it's changed quite a bit now there's an awesome guild on the island
called the Vancouver Island Home Growers Guild we recently had him on and he's in the Victoria
you know what's funny he was literally he did uh him Tom and Francis did a show yesterday in my
uh lounge fuck off yes he he brought a bong like an old Italian piece it's he wants me to make it
for the like the show really cool that's awesome so he was literally at my place yesterday that's
that's great he's a great person and he's so nice amazing character oh just a super chill dude
fucking energy though like he's got like a really good positive vibe and energy yeah when he is
talking to you you are looking directly at each other very engaging very engaging it's like he is
interested in what you're saying and I am interested in what you're saying hey conversation
it's it's nice it's nice when you can find that and you know we get to find people like yourself
people of the plant that you know care for other things and other people and and you know that's
our main focus just about weed yeah it's about community right yeah everybody don't have to
smoke weed to be involved with the community they can support it you know you know what you don't
even need to smoke weed to be i know i know everybody that's going to be in my wedding
do it you know it's like cool exactly so like what's been has there been any community challenges
that you've run into like we've we've we've done a show on um the indigenous communities and the
challenges that they're facing with the with the non-indigenous community cannabis and and everything
going on there but I like out here it's hilarious because I get to have you at my home which is
which is very unique very different than than most times is out here you know when they locally put in
the the dispensary that I've never been to um they when they set that up um there was a huge
like there was a big you know epic social thing and people wanted to go in and protest and say
we don't want it in the area and it was just like it was really shocking and backwards and the judge
or whatever the community leaders that that the city hall said you guys are idiots like why would
they have to drive all the way to Lonsdale like just just like 15 20 minutes to pick up their
cannabis because you just don't want to store here it doesn't make any sense yeah and it's just like
it's weird shit like that that drives me absolutely nuts like it makes sense it's like you just kind
of think like who is this one person that's made this decision that has mentioned this to somebody
it's like you know what let's do this it's like it's like
and they're like you know what all right let's let's see what happens let's throw this let's
pitch this it means very you know when you get way up there politically like that's how it is
yeah well yeah then you gotta you gotta engage with your community and you gotta you gotta fight
for it a little bit there's a thing in and and on i gotta say no more you gotta say no more or or
and and you gotta like get get involved because it's like if you're i i agree with the you know
so i i've been coming up with this theorem right okay so remember in school we were talking and we
were talking about you talk about socialism and and capitalism right as the two separate sides
the big debate with with with capitalism was because you have competition in business
you have um there'll be better services in general right like because if you give everything to one
business the government to control and lead and run it's there be lazy and it won't be run properly
and that's that's the main problem with socialism is because because you have no options there won't
be any success or growth or development and and if you really look at me and my wife are looking at
the car today it's like well all these big businesses have created giant monopolies over
their entire region of the business and now they don't care of care for their customer base and
treat everybody like shit so it's like so you literally we've literally watched um that happen
like them do exactly what they said the other side would what socialism would cause and they've done
it with through capitalism it's fucking hilarious it's it boggles me both ways and i don't think
there's i don't think there's a perfect society i don't think i don't think there's ever going to
be anything that's truly perfect but if we can get along and agree a little bit yeah there will be
like never like we all know this never be like perfect but civil you know i mean just like
exactly like live your life let's let's do this okay cool like we have a few things to work on
the whole the whole tomato model i think is important for cannabis i think we need to be
able to to small community the eyes i mean there's also globalism as a whole i've been thinking about
this a lot is is like i used to work for a croissant company that import frozen croissants
from europe into canada and the whole idea of that is just like kind of gross to me now the idea that
you would produce something somewhere else and then chip it over but the concept when all it is
is pastry it's a certain i know it's made a certain way but wow that fucking it got me yeah i put a lot
of fucking a lot of key for that and it's a mix man i got some strong shit uh it's like a mix of the
the lemon cush headband and chernobyl that i have um which are both very very powerful they are yes
and and it's pretty feeling in throat do you need some more lemonade yeah yeah oh you're amazing
thank you that should be good appreciate that no problem nothing better than some homemade
leavening i agree it's an absolutely stupendously beautiful day
and and and i i look forward to continue to be an awesomely stupendous day um
so that whole movement of things and now we all want community and local right like i want to buy
food that's from around me i want to buy from businesses that are around me i want to buy bread
from my neighbor exactly right i want to be able to go to these places i want to be able to go
travel but i feel like this idea that we can ship a croissant from paris and cook it here and
create the exact same product here eliminates the development of culture as a whole but
it's still kind of sharing within the planet i i agree with that but i mean like how do you create
a canadian regional cuisine when you're importing products from all over the world like all of a
sudden the definitive creation of what is a cuisine now is is is kind of lost right like we
don't we don't cook with stuff from around us we don't we don't like we don't do a lot of things
that are from around us anymore right we bring it in from a long distance like i watched this woman
the other day on on instagram and she's like she does the thing like okay if what are you going to
do if you get sick you know and there's no hospitals there's no help there's no one to help
you what are you going to do right and she goes well this is what you can do and she makes oil of
oregano and she starts off with well first you take your extra virgin olive oil and you mix it
in with your dry oregano and i'm just thinking in my head i'm like so what are you going to do when
there's no doctors but there's also no extra virgin olive oil around what are you going to do
you know like that's going to run out yeah that's if you're running out of doctors you're running
out of extra virgin olive oil imported from italy i'm telling you what you know and and we don't even
know how to we don't even have a realm of investments it's crazy we don't even have the
system in place to be able to do these things properly that's why i think it's so important
to highlight businesses like yourself that that make that effort that to do things locally that
take that take something and almost recycle it i want to say it is it is like honestly it is like
an upcycling it is like an upcycling um thing because it is you know what i mean i am taking
an old decanter that's been sitting somewhere or it's like i find it at an antique store or
something i'm like holy shit that's pretty rare when i grab it and what's it gonna do just sit
on some old lady's shelf yeah just collecting dust like i even asked the i even asked sometimes the
auctioneers like how long has it been here they're like i don't know probably 10 years i'm like what
really 10 years nobody thought this in 10 years that's hilarious and because because it's a
collector's thing you know it's like it is somebody would want it you'd think they would
but the thing is nobody's like unless you're just putting it on the shelf and people don't want
clutter and stuff like they you know what i mean they want something that's functional that's true
if i want to show a piece in the middle of my table and i'm like a an adult with without children
even with children you know and i want to be able to like put something in the center of my coffee
table that i can consume out of that like looks nice that's what's important to me now yeah you
know like it it doesn't if it's and there's a lot of like i love the beautiful art pieces and
and i love seeing like what these glass artists do it's so fantastic and they do such amazing stuff
on the table and like that and i have so much mad respect for those guys it's it's amazing it's
hours of work and it's like dedication and their craft and like what they do like even my friend
michael just makes bowls of stuff yeah it's like holy shit man like you took a fucking piece of
glass and made that it's such an amazing art yeah it's crazy it's nuts then i see those like pieces
that look like ak-47s and like dragons that are like four feet long i'm like holy fuck i'm like
i'm looking at it i'm like well i don't think i'm gonna get some rock salt through that thing for
cleaning yeah you know like they're like special case and pieces that you use and you do have more
of an art piece it's more of that when it comes to like that stuff it's like gonna be like you
know eight thousand plus in cost that's more of an art piece that's like a mantle piece or something
on the wall exactly right you have a room to consume in that you can chill in it's kind of
like a lounge that's up on your wall you know what i mean it's like yeah yeah i mean don't don't get
me wrong it's it's it's very tempting every day but i imagine it's a little bit every day come on
yeah you know what i mean but it's funny so we're gonna do so i'm super excited because we were gonna
do like a first session with me and my wife we're gonna hit some some of those high-end glass pieces
we've got a we got burl and beyond oh yeah i've fucking been meaning to call that guy actually
i fucking want to grab coffee with that guy because i grabbed one of his bowls at the summit
to put on another 1968 piece really yeah and how did it work out pretty good
brilliant they're they're two chords perfectly nice it's like a kind of a pinkish peach color
ooh and it's like um just bold to stem and then the flat surface
pink bowl and then a little like really pink uh little pill yeah just banging wow yeah so they're
gonna provide a couple like fancy dancy pieces for why i i like you know what's funny i like
purchasing off the homies yeah like i'm just like i want to support you because i'm literally just
gonna put it on one of my bonds i'm not gonna ask you for a free bowl i don't want to do that
exactly right well and you're building a relationship right if you're making bonds
right and you're you're and you're gonna put glass pieces in it anyways you know why not
support your local community in this way or build a business together right yeah and then i'll still
pay i'm still gonna promote i'm still gonna take pictures of it right and they're gonna be good
pictures they're gonna be good pictures um but yeah borrow and beyond man you're dope
very good people very good so yeah and then i got dragon flyers medicine
shall we rest of the day and thank you because apparently they're going to ship us a little
wedding present for the consumption morning for the consumption of that event which will be
lucky you yeah i'm blessed i mean i get to i get to hang out with beautiful people like yourself
on the regular basis and and get to know the community and i really am blessed at the the job
that i get to do that i'm turning this into not a job but a life you'll know i'm able to function
it with the family and do the things that i want to do like the idea of building a farm and and
helping a whole community yeah building community around me right like yeah the farm is the community
exactly right yeah and show and change something different and and and out here it's just so hard
you know it is a lot harder and it's cold you could do it down south even you know i mean if
you need some people down there or whatever do down south and like costa rica or nick braguar
or something like that do down there it's so there's i know lots of people down there too
and it's like lots of people it's like i don't know man like ever or south it seems to be okay
it's like my friend posted one time he's like i aim to live in a place that does not get below
25 degrees celsius i yeah so the lowest temperature in italy where we'll be living
is 10 degrees celsius oh perfect yeah so it's like i can grow anything in the world
like like i can grow like your tropical banana year-round anything because of the way it's
situated because because italy's shaped like a boot right you got that kind of
coast and the and then yeah with the heel on it right so so because of where it's located it's
actually located in loco tundra which is in uh the right in kind of the top end of the heel
so you're literally the area's surround we're in we're a little bit further inland but we're
surrounded by water and in a very narrow corridor you catch yourself in a fucking pothole you're
fucked yeah you'll break off yeah yeah probably the the shore looks like it's always kind of
breaking off slowly so we're a little bit further inland just in case just in case
maybe maybe it will be we'll try and stay up high uh but uh because it's shaped there it's
got a good temperate climate so it's like it's actually gets some moisture and stuff like that
so it's not like 70 80 90 like like like no no that's that's overly high like um 40 or 50 degrees
celsius you know like it's not too crazy hot and melty yeah it'd be very fun um because i'm
canadian still even if uh even if you had a greenhouse and it reached those temperatures
that is easily controlled but when it's like gets to that degrees inside that's easy control by about
like four or five thousands yeah and some yeah like you can you can control that when it gets to
like 80 or more you're like oh i gotta fucking slow down here yeah it gets it gets little nuts
um it's it it'll be a challenge and stuff like that so what has been what has been
like how often you get to put out pieces in the market how can we support you and then like what
what's been the the the what are you working on right now is there something new i'm i'm
i'm working on like a lot of uh actually a lot of pieces are in the 50s to 65-ish area right now
and there's a lot of kind of like similar collection or similar like years and they're
just like different makers and uh there's some funny ones but not really funny ones they're all
like really cool but there's gonna be some uh laughs you know for one of them i'm gonna test
which is gonna be a funny story um stay tuned later and um uh but uh yeah just working on some
old pieces right now that i found at um unfortunately um like kind of a military
memorabilia store that was downtown victoria for like probably 40 50 years it's like closing
oh no yeah so they had a big like sale and then um the guy i i didn't he wasn't even asking much
for them so i was like you went to go give me a deal i'm like don't give me a deal just charge
me full he goes what are you talking about like just charge me full man it's okay like don't give
me a deal please i beg you and he's like okay they charge me because it's like i know i'm gonna
you know use them for what i'm gonna be doing for but you know it's it takes a while to find these
that's why i don't post often yeah so i post like probably once every two and a half weeks
yeah maybe three that that that that i feel worthy that i would like to post yeah i'm like oh
this would be really nice i get this whole like you know like it's a feel almost it's kind of
like you look at something you're like i need to get that online for people i don't even care
of itself i just want people to see it oh fuck yeah exactly see if it's cool see what's going
on there sorry i was distracted with the chat there for a second um but i was gonna say like
it it must be kind of like because i grew up watching like
pawn stars and and that type of thing where it's like you hunt for old old memorabilia
antiquities and stuff like that is that kind of like because that's what i see you doing
like a little well it's like yes i am like i am hunting or whatever like always but it's like
not like you know i do it very leisurely so i'm like if i'm out walking doing stuff or whatever
i'm like oh there's an antique store maybe i'll pop in there see what's up it's like i've never
been there before and it's like oh look at that that's pretty cool just part of your daily you
know i mean it's kind of like i just like throw it in i do you know i do make it so all my avenues
of my income cover for me to be kind of free to do whatever i want on kind of a daily basis yeah
like so that if you see a piece that you you really want you can grab it because you don't
you might not be able to use it right away but you need to have it around yeah that or you know
i maybe couldn't come back there in like three or four days and it might be gone exactly so it's
like and then somebody will buy it they won't do what i do no they won't they'll just have it on a
shelf i want it to be smoke out of a bowl i mean like that's kind of the fun part to be able to
have something on your shelf and go that's a really beautiful piece of art it's like oh yeah
you want to smoke out of it well that's the funny thing there's a fucking buddy of mine in pei
so prince of rhode island okay all the way across the shore of canada opposite shore of canada across
the whole country tip to tip and uh he's got six pieces and they're on like a nice mantle
like above his bar nice and his friends go over like oh let's smoke some weed and he grabs like
one of the bongs like those are balls and he goes yeah man you need to check out this guy in victoria
so it was kind of cool because i did actually a big two liter growler for a brewing company
that he knows so he sent me out the growler i made into two like with it like a
ash catcher but like a two liter like super chugger um bong and i sent it back to him and
it was like he's like fuck yeah this is awesome and they loved it like the brewing company was
solar is can you talk about that a little bit because you have to keep in like and what i mean
by that is is is choosing like the recyclers and how you how you shape these bongs out because
you you got a nice piece of glass that's that's quite old and you the last thing you want to do
is be forcing sticks and having to clean crevices and stuff like that so i can see that you you've
managed to think intelligently because a good portion of you know the audience that's out there
not everybody's going to be taking nice extracts and stuff like that and cleaning it meticulously
every single time in between every single exactly people are gonna a lot of people are
that's why i love the ash catcher yeah you know like they're gonna use them as pieces so can you
tell me like a little bit on how that like how you think about that process and how you try and
ensure that people get the best outcome yeah so i like at home i have like an array of like stems
that cover from like you know every stem that you know if you're an average toker
or or a bong smoker or whatever um or you know stems there's like tons of different ones so
go some super chuggy open end with slits or with no slits just like straight tube
to all the way to like a super diffused for dabbing or like a dab stem where it's very percolated you
know what i mean and which is not bad but you have to have an ash catcher because that shit clogs
like two seconds so one hit is clogged you know what i mean so it's like or maybe two
hits it's clogged i mean if it's a six percolator or whatever but usually you can get away with like
some type of uh i like to use slim 14 mils so slim stems okay because i always kind of realize
um they're like a more of a volume piece so it's like just like a ball sometimes or
it's kind of more it's no there's no like taper too skinny it's just kind of like one area
so you got to have a little bit better flow so that's why i always seem to get drawn to the
slims because they just have that just smidge of drawback that you need to make it a smooth
bong to just go right down to your ears. Yeah i mean and there's a there's a bong toke i think
for every person right? A hundred percent. I think my wife likes chuggers she likes a
yeah yeah you know that really heavy. And i have those. Yeah. I have those so it's like it depends
on the piece i'm like you know what this should be a chugger you know so i just made one right now
that i have to take photos of at home um and it's fucking beautiful it's like a moonshine bottle
it's like a moonshine blue. You should be able to you should be able to like use it like a flute in
between in between bong tokes you know what i mean like you should be able to play in a band
and have a toke playing a band in a country band you know what i mean like that's exactly what i'm
seeing is me playing on a country band with nothing but the nothing but the moonshine jug
with it with a bong toke able to be taken out of it like nice deep bellow you know that yeah there
you go yeah yeah well i do have a setup a little scene set up already for it for a photo nice so
i've got some like a little bit of uh stuff going on so it's gonna be pretty cool so that's like i
always kind of say that you're the cumulative things of your life result in one of the things
that you're meant to do you know what i mean like i i did acting when i was younger so i got and and
then i got really into my school like the the structure of how it went so we built our first
um our first uh student council there and then we that that so i got really into that and then when
i got out of there i got into cooking so i got really obsessed with working with my hands creating
art form and that led me into led me into food and then then farming and then organic and then
and it's all kind of accumulating this process into what i do what i've kind of turned this into
now and that i get to share with everybody here on a regular basis so it's like what were the
things that have come together to accumulate into the sum of trevor mr bougie bong himself now
i don't know there's lots of things i've done a lot of changes in my life last like
probably three to four years probably even five years dramatic change five years ago you know i
mean just like can you insinuating what i'm going to do in life and i do i want to
step into the realm of being a creative you know i mean i was like do i make that jump
as more of an artist yeah not just a photographer which is also art i get it but i was doing it as
a business or kind of like making money and that's still the basis of it i do like to make money of
course that's that's my job um and i i can yeah yeah it's enjoyable still i love it and uh but
this opens up like the more of a creative side of trevor exactly and uh it just opens up because
i had a friend of mine come visit from toronto kathy what's up um and she always seen me as
more of a creative not just a photographer she's like you like do this and you build bikes and
you're like involved in the movies and it's like what do you like who are you what exactly like do
you do like it's like i love that kind of question that comes out sometimes yeah so what exactly do
you do well i do like eight things that make very little money you know i do like three or four
things so i like i help with movies i do photography i build bikes for people and i make bongs
so there's four the the photography and the bong thing is kind of a that's like 85 15 and the rest
is five so like so what how do you bring that the the photography side into your bong creation
um the photography side is like choosing art that i like to see you know what i mean like you know
i would see and i'm like you know what that is enjoyable to look at like i really like that like
as an art piece alone so i go that route that's one route then i'm like can i photograph it well
that's my next route and i'm like you know what that would look really good but i'll have an idea
already as soon as i see it i'll think of it it's weird how my brain works i'll see a piece and i'll
imagine a photo where it like should be like the living room that it's meant for it's like not
really the living room i think of more of the photo shoot to promote it like the branding for it yeah
showing like taking a photo in an area and this like photo flashed in my brain and it was in a
it's in an alley in victoria and fantan alley it's the back door of a little like asian cooking
restaurant and it's just like kind of a scuzzy door but it's fucking really good food and i just
kind of want to put it right beside the door in this dark lit dirty area and then just like have
the fucking nice box in there because it kind of fits that like black like kind of like rawness to
it that grunge on it yeah like i love that you know and it's kind of the element of the world
that we live in and it's like often people try and give these really polished views of life and
things and stuff that they do like they make all these effort like i made the effort for you for
for this to all be set up and for us to have a nice thing but it's it is pretty simple and i try
and keep it pretty natural um but i like to think that it's my goal in life is to let things kind of
look as normal as they are like let's show some of the shitty parts let's show the bugs on the
plants let's let's show us trying to fix it let's show the problems let's have the kid that runs
into the screen in the middle of the episode you know like let's have these errors and lifestyle
because i want to you know be part of the community and connect with people yeah i don't want to just
like you know here's this perfect image because it's fucking bullshit nobody has nobody's perfect
right no as long as we can go with the flow it's kind of nice so going with the flow
what's been like are you going to be at grow up this year are you going to be going to yeah i'm
going with uh tom and the tdc nice yeah so i'm doing a little uh story day oh very so mr mr
bong style very neat so if you if you go to my profile on instagram and you see some of my
videos or whatever i do these kind of cut videos of like mail days and so that
it'd be kind of like that kind of like a story for the day so yeah it's always a story that's what
that's what's like most you want to tell me a little bit about the dink the the different
collective event we'll give them a good old plug yeah different collective is a collective that
has uh been founded by tom different way goes by the tom who the dot dot tom dot different yes
collective yeah that's correct that's correct uh but uh he's uh he's the founder with some partners
and he's created of like a giant collective of artists and people in the business
to help make this uh stigma and this change the world change the world a little bit yeah
show what we are and that we're normal people and we're good people too yeah but it's like it's
actually like a creative of artists there's like a bunch of people like there's writers there's
photographers there's uh online uh kind of presence people there's um lawyers there's you know
there's a bunch of different like avenues of people so it's like in touch with like around
canada for sure if not other places actually um that are a part of yeah like there's a guy from
germany in here it's like it's awesome and uh yeah anyways yeah so it's a big collective of people
that you can go to and literally can cover all your needs if you need anything to do with
online presence awesome yeah i mean it's a pretty we've had alley on
before and we of course did the um conference at the bc craft summit so we'll see it there
but then we also did uh alley was on a little bit a little while ago um the high giant uh we
were talking about and it's always nerve-wracking for me to say this so i'll like the indigenous
market the title is a little bit differently worded but i didn't write it so you know what
i mean um but it was a really brilliant show and really insightful to kind of hear from that side
of the community which we don't get to hear from as much at all you know especially here in you
know very kind of white central vancouverish area yeah um like there used to be a dispensary that
was indigenous owned um just at the indigenous community down the road here in deep cove but i
remember two two cops rolling up one day and shut it down and i'm just like well why and what and
where and how and so i don't know i guess there's there's a whole bunch of different communities and
a different you know opinions on things but it's nice to be able to give a lot of these people some
voice and some audience yeah and i i should know this and i don't i i do apologize but uh i'm not
even quite sure on how many indigenous owned dispensaries are on the island let alone victoria
because there's got to be like i know there's more than four in victoria there's got to be more than
four there's got to be yeah because it's just like it's such a big community right and why not
and uh yeah like it's it's great to have them in the communities because it's like one
it's like you know i mean like in understand i think those like weed stores in those areas
should be as free i know it's a little bit thing but you know uh you know a heavy discount if you're
in the area or whatever blah blah blah right like help the community out maybe make it easier you
know yeah make it so they don't have to like travel 20 kilometers to get weed yeah and get
good weed yeah and and and and yeah and all that because there's i mean there's definitely some
smaller businesses coming online now that i think are going to have a lot higher quality
going to coming to market so i'm excited to like i was oh sorry go ahead no go ahead go ahead oh
yeah like i was just in um shushof area like up in the ankle minute my brother's um like cabin
right on the main road just drive the road out of nowhere bam weed store yeah i was like
nice so went in there they had like pretty much all the brands you know main brands that you could
rock on the island or in vancouver really nice one shushop really yeah there he takes it take
some more lemonade if you need it you know what you know what's really interesting a couple weeks
ago we had on these this brilliant um kind of community in um colorado area 420 so check out
the previous episode where we did with area 420 with um brainstrap genetics and and it was a
really fun episode they've actually taken a small rural community that had a lot of you know a lot
of challenges a lot of problems a lot of problems a lot of challenges and a lot of issues because
they weren't getting very much tax money they didn't have a lot of community and growth in it
they had a lot of problems and now they're looking at changing their name of the town to kush
because this area 420 came in and they helped grow the community and develop it that's a brilliant
move and whoever made that decision hats off to you mate it's it's crazy to think that a community
actually going to go in and jump in to do that right and that would be crazy that would be
awesome but if there's like there's other towns called there's a town called weed yeah it's in
california it's totally a thing like it's not out out of the world or anything like that there's
nothing odd about it so it's like why not why why couldn't there be a kush town and this so this town
has just completely embraced the whole idea and now there's like a whole bunch of producers in
the space there and they're going to change to possibly change the name of the town to kush
and like really change the the the the image and the other thing is once people see i think
victoria should change the name to fucking kush yeah that'd be victoria kush or it should be bc
budsland what what would what would you if you named victoria island if you could rename victoria
what would you rename it to what does the audience think because i'd love to know yeah
what would i rename it i don't even know quick draw off the gun
i don't know i just like i i'd probably just make the i would try and make the whole island like as
one just call it the island you know like just try and get everyone okay we're not going to split it
up let's just kind of all work together here guys let's just like make it one this is the island
yeah that that sounds about right i feel like that's already what's said we're from yeah the
island it's like no matter what island yeah oh yeah where you're from i'm from the island
yeah and if somebody goes what island then you're like oh okay yeah i'm from victoria
usually you say the island first we're like oh cool i was like they have no idea so well some
people don't because they've never been there before and uh um it's just funny when people
ask like yeah what should we do in victoria i'm like absolutely nothing grab a coffee and go for
a walk and relax and go downtown and just enjoy the sights of like get up leave your place at
like 10 30 grab a coffee and go see what goes on in victoria just spend the day walking around
and enjoying yourself exactly and you can eat and drink your way right through that city too
which is awesome yeah you can snack yeah you can like literally snack your way through which is
which is great do you have a favorite digs do you want to get your favorite restaurant in the city

going to give it our sponsor a quick shout out thank you to green amber lighting if you're
looking for your badass lighting check them out right now they're canadian company they do all
their building and everything here so they're they're part of our community so make them part
of yours there's some great people over there so go check that out they got like the cadillac
of lighting oh yeah you got a good big one out of that one that's what i'm talking about
well well well what do you taste tell me a little bit about what flavor you get out of that
because it's not like it's not like any much other things it's like onto it if i was tasting
an area of atmosphere it would be like late spring so it'd be like kind of foresty
but with some sweet kind of wild berries in there nice that's what i taste it it really brightens
up and cuts back some of that stuff too eh that's fucking crazy that's that's great
that's that's great oh my god that's so great and uh shout out to uh gauzy glass for the bowl
um that thing fucking rips good bud thanks and oh i actually bought it at
coochie's so show it to you too thank you
we're saying interstate there we go there we go a little bit while we have a little session here
before we go and we'll do a little tour of the garden yes we'll have a little session
why not and consume a little bit here so okay y'all got any questions in the chat as well go
ahead and pop those in um and and definitely if you're in victoria and you're going to be
able to grow up we're going to have to connect and do a session 100 uh i will probably have
some people over so be aware
um but i'll be there with tom and uh having a good time and i'm only like
10 minute walk from the place that's straight down the road
that's straight down the road
so again we've got microphones with wires and cords and stuff so yes we do while we have a
quick session and move to our next location i'm going to put a little bit of music up
and show you our garden downstairs uh while we have quick intermission and and get a little bit
more comfortable and move it around a little bit here so have a little look at our our downstairs
garden we can go full on like that and you can see what's going on down there maybe you see
some troublemakers running around i'm not too sure but we'll be right back with you in just a
moment that device on the table is fine farming is i have a uh yeah it's not is there is enough
weed in there so it's a it's a volcano style vaporizer i think this is this one branded as a
riser the cheaper version and i just run a whip through a water bomb so you can get like best
kind of flavor profile i think out of a vaporizer i find vapes are really tough on the the throat
and they can really get you bad um so i really like to run it through a bubbler so this is kind
of my go-to this is how i smoke every single day because it it you know it cleans it and it's nice
good hit and again we'll be right back we're going to move down to our lower area in a second
so we are just having to wander through the garden while we arrive at our next location here
you should have plenty of cord i'm probably stepping on it yeah i see what's up
you can just go yeah over this way now on the left
okay i got you so we're managing the cords a little bit here while we do this so patience
everybody as we set all of this up have everything it's okay that's just uh an interesting variety
of herbage
try and pull a little bit hopefully the audio doesn't get all screwed up in the process
i can flip it over just a second
there we go again we're just walking around the garden while we get recorded over to the right
and hopefully everything should be all right we're about to hey we're you're on camera right now
so we're gonna go and we're gonna go in
sorry guys we are coming up and line up right into this spot here over here
with me you can come through this way you got enough cord there is that's the camera out there
she is a warm one so thank you good choice for clothing today on mr boujee bond all black on a
25 degrees celsius day in vancouver it's like thank you weatherman for telling me the opposite
so you know what i'm gonna show you here this is kind of cool
beautiful pepper there so i really wanted to come down show you a little bit of the garden here
and get to get to show everybody some of the garden which i don't often get to show
and and also we'll do our closing down here as well there you go so i got some really neat
varieties of things i really want to try and taste and touch so this is my lemon push headband
this is actually pheno number one you had pheno two i believe if you want to give this a nice
rub down on the stem and and have a good good smell of that and tell me what you what what
what do you get out of that oh it's super cool isn't it like it's like got some lemony freshness
like it's weirdly sticky yeah it's almost like i even smell pineapple yeah really it's like it's
like a really sweet taste very very unique very different not super crazy powerful that's nice
you can like you could make it up you could you could that's what i was trying to feel like how
could you utilize because actually when you dry the stem out which i have some right here how do
you make well i guess you can make infused bath bombs if you get that if you smell just the wood
i just smelled it it stays like it doesn't go away you can use that as as something to infuse
you know aroma into or something like that my wife's always trying to find
weird stuff to go that's why i have like these odd things thank you adele with two l's
have you tried salad barnett before no i have this is a neat herb it's got a little bit of spice
to it is it like a mysterious thing kind of like a regular salad or it tastes like pepper corn it's
a little bit peppery it's a little bit peppery which is kind of fun um i love that there are
we got a salad 100 we have some habanero peppers you like shiso yeah some purple shiso
in the garden that's pretty fresh really nice and so yeah we've got some green onions and stuff
like that so we're gonna have um we're gonna grow most food hopefully for the wedding

i've been around now twice for like a lavender uh like a lavender place like lavender farm for
like something like that and everything it was just like so overloading and then it like it
fucked my senses all up about it and i was like never again that's hilarious that's why i don't
i don't uh it's fine i love it it looks really nice and i appreciate the people just loving it
it's just like nah no no it's got this like sense to me that i just don't like that i they make this

really enjoyable flavor it's very kind of light and and and yeah lavender it's like purple too
