And we are live and wiggling. You can see clearly on the screen we are here again
with Claude to discuss and release some more creepy crawly bugs and get into it.
I mean I don't think they're creepy crawly. I think they're cute and fuzzy at this
point in time. We're starting to fall in love with them on this channel. But again
we are here to check out some bugs and and do a release before Joda's live show
tonight in about now in less than an hour. So hopefully we could drum up some
people for him and we could drag him over there as well. So but anyways we
have Claude here. What do we have showing in front of us Claude and what are we
looking at here because we've got some some something going on. Yeah you can see
moving around and sometimes they could fly too is the Aureus insidiosus. Also
known as the minute pirate bug. It is a general's predator. It is a mainly used
against trips. It could eat baby aphids, white flies. Oh here we see one. And
usually they're like always like 45% female, 55% male depending like their sex
ratio differs. So they're carried in a buckwheat house like you see there.
So husks. Hull, husk. Because those are two parts aren't they? Right there's the hull
and then I think the husk is first. But I have no idea what either of those two
things are significantly in relation to this. So like you guys is it is it this
is a particular texture why they're using a material like this or is it a
particular moisture level? They like to be able to be hiding in little crevices
and be moving around like you see there in the container. They won't attack
each other though. But they will they will though eat other eggs of like even
your predators. Like I mean they're kind of very voracious. I hear they're
they're a little bit asshole-ish. This is what my understanding is. They really
like they only want to do what they want to do. They love to hunt all day long. So
they will eat a lot of a lot of trips every day. But I mean they really
they will go around and they will eat. They will just I mean hunt for fun for
sport. So they will kill a lot of trips. And what makes them good also is that
they will eat on mobile stages of trips. They also attack spider mites. Any
soft-bodied insects in fact are very small. They are about their size. I mean
they won't really attack bigger. They don't go after big aphids or
things like that. So people use them mainly for trips control. But they will
help have good other things that they will take care of. Its life cycle is
about three weeks at 21 degrees Celsius. And it's also temperatures above 15
degrees and 60% relative humidity. It's what it prefers. And the
female will they will lay eggs themselves. About three eggs during their lifetime. So
they in good conditions they can make the colonies can maintain
themselves. I mean colonies that you can form a colony of your aureus. Especially
if you use banker plants. Their preferred banker plants would be ornamental
peppers because they produce a lot of flowers. So you could use regular pepper
plants. But I mean ornamental is great because if they're made to produce
flowers. So the aureus will feed on the pollen and they will reproduce in it. So
somebody sent me pictures from a cannabis facility and they had these rows of
banker plants in a basket just over the cannabis plants. And some of them were
peppering ornamental peppers for their aureus. That's pretty cool. I got I got a
few peppers floating around. I actually have a little bit of thrip damage and I can I
can pull this over because we're not getting too much action there. But I'd
love you to like talk about what's happening right here in the plant if we
could. Because I do have I mean that that to me is thrip correct? Yes exactly.
These are this is thrips damage. Totally. Oh so you need these little aureus.
Are you and the thing is though with with aureus is that it will fall into a
diapause if it less it gets less than 14 hours of daylight. So it is not a good
predator really in the re-flowering in cannabis. It is also has a bad habit of
like going to like getting stuck in the butt. So he's not. They're not you're
saying they're not really great for flower they're more for the vegetative
stage. Could you like take a banker plant that you were like say like an ornament a
small ornament or pepper plant and maybe move it in and out of the
greenhouse or your flowering space to kind of allow yourself the you know time
and allow them to make sure that they have that light? Or will it matter while
they end up moving over then they'll go into the subtle space like what's that
time period look like? I mean they'll be during like if they have like around 12
hour daylight like during the flowering cycle that we do. They will they will be
like like we say in the diapause I'll be sleeping and they won't be active but
they won't die I mean it's the days the length of days come back longer again
that they will they will turn to be active again. Okay cool so like that
that's definitely possibility. So I want to put these kind of in my that you'd
ideally put them in your veg space where you're gonna get more than 14 hours of
light and then kind of like when would you suggest it's a preventative or is it
is it like am I using this to combat? What's what's the idealism here?
Because I know some are really great preventatives and I know some aren't so
great preventative. They're more more of an attack plan like like let's deal with
the situation and they're gonna bounce right? So what can we expect with Oreos?
I would say it's more of like you use them like in situations where you need
help but it can be as used as a preventive because I would say if you
have pollen to give it. If it can feed on pollen then it can be used as a preventive
because that would stand like without any prey like I'm living without any
prey. So you see them there. They run a lot and they fly so that's the fun of it
too. They will go and find the trips where they are. So the scars that you
show on your cannabis leaves it's really the trips. They will like go and scrape
the leaf kind of they kind of scrape the leaf and they will like with their
still it they're gonna and they I mean they spill some saliva on it so it
pre-digests the leaf tissue and then they will they have this kind of mouth
part or still it kind and they will suck up the space they've made. So what you
see is a layer of cells that's missing and it turns whitish, silverish, even
bronze and there's little black specks you see it's a trips frazz. So it's
experiments there. There are little black spots you see here and there near the
trips mark. It's the poop no? It's their poop right? Exactly and these little
trips they're so elusive and like they reproduce so fast when temperatures are hot. Let's say
it's like 20 Celsius they will lay like about four eggs and they will like their
eggs will like take maybe three days to hatch but if the trips have 26 Celsius
or more that's more than 80 they will lay 15 eggs and they will it will take
one and a half days instead of a two for them to hatch so it really speeds up the
process. So when you have a trip situation Aureus is a good ally because
it eats so many trips and it hunts so many prey every day that it's gonna be
more efficient than Cucumeris I would say or Swirsky which are the
predatory mice that are used usually and because Cucumeris will eat the first
stage of trips and Swirsky will eat the two first larval stages but Aureus will
eat all stages. It won't just go the only thing it doesn't go after is the
eggs in the leaf tissue and the adults are flying. The adults are flying you
catch them with their sticky traps either yellow or blue will do the trick but
then with sticky traps we might... Is there an opinion on that yellow or blue do we
have a favorite because I the eternal debate is blue or yellow sticky
traps? Exactly me in fact I prefer yellow because you get more fungus gnat and you
see it more easily so I get as many trips on yellow traps and on blue traps
but maybe to get maybe get try to compare yourself if your trips prefer the blue or yellow.
They're pretty cool-looking little bugs right so they're they're they're
pretty indiscriminate or notorious. I've heard that they'll just like run by and
kill stuff and just run off and like not even eat it right they're just like
oh well screw you bite. So you talked about like beneficial peppers as being a
good plant and and so what about like application like you said like I'm
hearing that if I go up into the higher temperatures like going into the 28 29 30
I'm gonna I'm gonna risk risk increased population of thrips because they're
gonna develop a lot faster so like in a situation releasing these should I try
and maintain an early 20 temperature in my space and and is there a humidity
that's desired and how low should we go when it comes to temperatures? 60% but you
have to make fewer flowering and you have to make now flowering the photo
period doesn't fit but so usually in veg you are you get the higher relative
humidity so 60% it likes it likes it it's not that that finicky I mean like
certain predators that really need that target temperature if it's at least 15
degrees Celsius and more than six around 60% relative humidity it will do well
and the adults they live about three to four weeks. And as we're talking like
ambient air temperature as that not like soil temperature hitting 50 degrees.
It's cool these are these are fun little ones I this is I've dropped a few bugs
in my lifetime to say the least but I haven't done these before so I'm excited
to see kind of that this is the now now thrips aren't necessarily the most
damaging plant I mean like they can definitely get voracious and go hard on
some plants but I noticed they often target very weak plants they often don't
target the stronger of the plants that I'm growing like how bad are thrips and
how like what what what is the worry when we're coming them like is it one of
those things like you see thrips you need to act immediately or is it one of
those things where you can take a little bit more time and judge the situation
and allow maybe some of your already natural predators to see what see if they
even it back out again at least you're like recommendation there it's it's not
the same as spider mites or if it's which gets out of control very very
rapidly for sure like I said like trips if the temperature is high it will get
nasty more rapidly but it's not the same as like spider mites or like you had
said you can relax a bit more with trips than then the other two I meant
just mentioned if it's in spider mites because they they trips will damage the
leaf like it weakens the plant if trips can bring viruses to to the plant so
this is another thing that you don't want to happen and so I would go like to
fight trips in fact would be with a predator in the soil and predatory mites
in the soil like stratolelapse also known as the coaspis or gale in people
in Canada gale elapsed ESP I its cousin and so they will live in the soil even
on top of your rock to rock or cubes and these will get the coupon the pre
people and the people of trips so the third and fourth stage of the trip cycle
and the other aureus or predator mites the cumulus worst key or Kelly from
Chris even will get the trips that the first level stage in the second one so
that way you cover the ground you get the third and fourth stage on the
foliage you get the first and the second stage with aureus or any other like
predator and might so you can use and there's always there's a lot of options
for trips that's what it makes it easier to fight them because you can use the
metals you could use both are yet to Bovary is not compatible at all with
aureus but very you want to give me the full technical name over a very a
bossy Anna I was gonna say that and I was gonna sound so smart I didn't so
next time I know I've got it right there's four strains on the market I
think there's four of them in the States and two or three of them about to be
three of them in Canada so there's a Bovary a best Anna and row tree which
is ours at bio service and GHA was his button button jar and so different
strains will have different variances against different pests and aureus
doesn't it doesn't tolerate Bovary it kills it very fast so so if you have to
use Bovary against trips you would use it first and then later on and to
reintroduce aureus just after that's a couple of days later because a Bovary
it's an immediate slight so it will be inactive in a couple days after you
sprayed it and then you can safely introduce your aureus and it'll be
doing fine okay that's I mean that's a great answer I've been like is it
there's there's always the challenge of like hey I put them down and then they
disappear like a little bit later and I love being able to do these with you
because we can go through kind of like the better processes like what are the
temperatures what are the ways to do it so is there like I know this might be a
tough one for you because I don't think a lot of people like really get into
this is there is there favored plants for thrips like are there certain pants
that that thrips really enjoy eating that might be an excellent deterrent for
some of them like a spot for them to congregate to to further you know deal
with you know as a cover crop item or something like that that's a very good
question in fact they really love this but you mean you having a trap plant
yeah yeah like something that they flavor maybe not necessarily like a full
trap plant like I have some tobacco over here and that things are just like so
sticky that anything goes on it it dies it just like gets stuck to it like it's
incredible but maybe something that they prefer to eat more like it may be prone
to lettuces like maybe is there a crop that you guys know is like worrisome
with thrips that can take over maybe like like a vis or spider mites can do
to cannabis cucumbers cucumbers they can just go hard a yes yes and they love
the flowers and they love the so the trips that you when you go with scalp
the numbers you go for the flowers first to see if there's any trips and you'll
find them in the flowers and one day they played so just on top of my mind
that was this plan but they're pretty much they're really polyphagous I mean
they don't eat a lot of plant so I mean any tissue that plant tissue that may be
soft or tender you know for them to go and graze on because I'm graze on earth
great but the thing is is that so that's it they did many type of plants but so I
know that in fact I helped outdoor grower in Canada a licensed producer
with another crop and usually you don't get big issues with trips outdoors
because there's a lot of natural predators present and if you haven't put
any cuttings yourself or any plantlets that were already infested with trips
then you shouldn't be alright with outdoor plants up in our northern
hemisphere in Canada I don't know about California yet I would have to ask the
but or other like warmer latitudes but in Canada it's a pretty much what
happens and but it can change if you're surrounded by wheat or any hay or things
like that that will get harvested if it gets harvested then usually there's a
some trips population present and naturally these are and then what will
happen as the farmer is mowing down his law is a field you will get these swarms
of trips that are coming there are migrating in mass towards your cannabis
plants so that happened to a licensed producer and we intervene with with
Aureus we release 4,000 per acre to help the natural population to combat this
invasion that instant invasion that happened in a day so it was a but
usually I will just intervene like that and spots Aureus is already present
because we are already had found a little bit of them like we're when we're
scouting what we just boosted the natural population to fend off this
invasion interesting so I've kind of heard of that a little bit and that kind
of general issue and having to like like they don't necessarily take over whether
certain situations like hay and when you take down a crop or a field that's been
harvested you get a mass evacuation of plants because they don't really like
dead plants like a lot of these things don't eat any sort of dead plants so
like but hay is something like you there's hay on 90% of my cover crop on
90% of my cover like I just throw hay down all the time am I fucking making a
perfect place for is that like the entrance for threats like are you are
you giving you the no it's just because they they would have stayed there I mean
but since it was harvested the field that's what made them migrate okay so
they wouldn't stick around on the dead material for long no and they I I saw
them also might try to migrate on broccoli fields and and they didn't like
it at all you know they couldn't like they didn't like this type of thick
foliage they have a difficulty so my guess is your cannabis plants are more
resistant might have ticker in the cup late at like tick I don't know like
maybe more imagined a million type like kind of cannabis like more like tick
like you know this kind of leaf tissue they're really like not like the ten
Sativa or anything like that yeah you more at more susceptible maybe to trip
I'm just saying that yeah I mean I like I definitely have some some thrift issue
as I showed you there it's it's but it's like it's an interesting thing and I
think using hay is an interesting like product and I think that should be
noticed that like so like is there I've always wondered and I guess this is a
great opportunity because we got a little bit of time to dig anyway here is
like where the hell do aphids go when everything freezes I know I I might I
know that might be a gorgeously simple question but I'm sure a few people have
wondered that over the time and not really been able to seek it out a fence
usually there will over winter and egg form so do you do something separate
like go lay in the soil or something like that or they let it on the plants
and then when the plant dies and falls down it kind of goes into it as well
yeah depending on the but usually what I know is that they will lay eggs because
usually I will take care of if I know like now they are in the making Ontario
in certain fields like cannabis aphids so I know that the eggs have been laid
because everything was really picked well out of the field so I assume there
were somewhere they were left there in the ground I mean so it's like trying to
fight it's like trying to hold water with your hands sometimes right like
it's just it's there's always some some little bit here or there everywhere but
it was like I've always like some something some like I think it's like
the monarch butterfly you know like that said that's a migratory animal that
comes up all the way up here over over a long period of time so I like I've kind
of wondered it are all of the usual problems that we have that we find in
our tents in our growth spaces and our issues are they usually 99% they're
there you know in the soil and they've managed to rest for a little bit and
that founds an opportune place or are they migrating to you seasonally
sometimes they will migrate seasonally yes our it like depends like or they
will be in the first year they'll migrate it'll be invasive and then it's
established itself like the squid midge in the garlic and leeks and all these
onions and it is now a plague like it's everywhere now people that try to grow
garlic and garlic does it does well it bears well because if you pass the
flower stage and the damage is not that important people are doing the leeks
it's like zero damage zero tolerance they cannot have a hole in their foliage
you know so so this is an example of something or like the spotted wing
drossophila it says like a fruit fly that arrived in 2009 at same time in
California and BC and then now it's spread all across North America and
usually the spotted wing dress fit the regular drossophila there are
repositories a tube like where they lay their eggs at all a excellent and they
they love they there is just a regular tube so they do all a eggs and decaying
fruit and rotten fruit and overripe fruit and but the new species the
spotted wing drossophila it's a repositor looks like a little saw so it
loves green fruit so it lays its eggs in the green fruit so the larva will
develop in the fruit some we scout the field and take a berry in our hand and
it's all juicy and then no there's extra protein now in the fruit a little bit
extra crunch in with your fruit off like that's that's true so I've like wondered
this so is thrip like you mentioned that thrips particularly like cucumber
and I'm something I've seen before and it and so one of the tell-tale signs of
thrips that's like kind of one of your early warnings other than the the leaf
that we showed a moment ago that I'll show again now other than this this kind
of thing is is they like to get all up in the tip and they don't they cause a
little bit of deformation in the in the plant in the growth they sometimes they
inject viruses you will detect them with the sticky traps because but you have to
be aware that they're very very tiny because you have your regular fungus
not stuck on your and it's a lot smaller a trip it's like more like a little
trait of like you you put a pencil like you did a tiny little line with a pencil
and then you look up with the magnifying lens and then you'll see oh it's a trips
because they've got feathery wings that don't really show they are very special
wing a very special flight and they tend to more to be more carried by wind
currents and electromagnetic fields and wind and movement of things more than
their own flight you know they depend on all that to move around trips but they
do fly but I mean it's a special pattern I met you guys explain it I think you
did I well I mean when you when you have something that small right like that's
really really really really really small and any movement of air is going
to be like moving its entire world so it makes sense that there would be like
parameter or methods in place for it to even be able to function as a creature
like when you're looking at scale of scalability and size it would be like
you know moving about a city with traffic instead of air you know like
bricks in the moving through instead of air you have so little control over
everything right like imagine a raindrop the size of the size of you
going around it'd be absolute like or strip is probably a like a very 100
the size of a raindrop probably when it comes down to the size portion of it
maybe first larval stage it's very small but then guess I think it's a bit bigger
than you really see them running on the loose and over the top of the leaves but
they're very furtive and they're very they really hide well and they like
they're called trips with an s because usually they're not alone and so me I
call them the bad trips when I see them oh no no no no bad trip so but yeah like
we had said before it's not my my most my biggest concern when I and a lot of
people get them yeah I imagine it's a pretty easy traveler it's something
they're attracted to probably do it whatever like the two main ones are the
flowers like the trips Frank Frank Franky and Ella of stunt tennis is the
most common one and flower trips and the Western flower trips and the there's the
tobacco or onion trips which is also present a lot and but it's less common
than the Sarge and I've gotten screwed up the image there so okay so let's talk
a little bit about like application size and placement like what are the what
what's the methodology here if I have you know a lot of the people in the chat
I mean I give anybody a voluntarily to let me know how big of a space that they
have here but I think most hobbyists like myself people that are growing
flower for me are probably running a 4x8 to it to a 10x10 space and for a
flower and then probably a secondary space that's like 8x8 for further
vegetative space and their small little basement grow or maybe their backyard or
whatever so we're not talking about huge spaces here what are kind of some
numbers like should should people be buying the smallest packs available
should they be upping the numbers a little bit to ensure that they get a
good hit of them what's the recommendation and what's the number
number count look like usually that like the packs like the smallest ones are
500 individuals there might be some companies are for less than that but
usually it's like at least 500 it's about it's around 40 bucks something
like that and there's a also thousand individuals and then you get more the
commercial sizes like for curative like you need one per 10 per square meter or
10 square feet so and then I thought I would go up to 10 so per 10 10 per 10
square feet I won't force you to do that at that math 10 square feet I can do it
for you I have a calculator we have these so I I know that score a square
meter I think is around 10 square feet something like that yeah nine like nine
in a bit I believe I think it's like nine in a bit but close it will just do
10 so if you you're doing prevention with it with with them you will like
introduce them two times in your garden about 14 days apart if you're ever
creative like you have some trips but not a big thing then one per square
meters and is okay every week as needed in fact because you until you get the
population of trips down really under that I like to say under detectable
levels that you don't see any they might still be there it's hard to reach your
education totally you have to go for sure it's the ultimate goal your
education but you have to maintain at least be realistic and say but you boost
your plant cells and things like that and then you add the preventive so that
there will be a balance to help against the trips like let's say that I was
sure the roof beetle or the predatory mites stretch of the laps take a people
as piss miles or ghetto laps in Canada at this for the soil or you can even use
the methods the stick your traps will get the adults
kikumaris and or Swarovski we will get the two first lovers ages so I think I
think I thought I saw okay yeah it was an or use but I thought that saw a nymph
or an orange nymph but no no I haven't seen any any any smaller sizes anyways
as I've been trying to do something coming along the way as I've been
trying to go along the oops what have I done we're back awesome I think that's
pretty cool so when we're put when we're putting these down where do we want to
sprinkle it on the plant do you want to sprinkle them on the ground around the
plant you open you receive your container yeah you check if it's moving
you're gonna see it easily because they're tiny but they're big enough to
see what you're making are yeah you will open your container and usually do
this as you describe it so that it comes up and then you will sprinkle them over
your infested plants so in which I just like because there's that little screen
that you can see there so I take the screen out so should I leave the put the
top back on yes yeah yeah to make it to make sure that you it helps when you
have a lot of plants to do and you don't want pre pulling like it drops on the
first plant the whole load like that so that way you can sprinkle because this
one in fact you could like open up your bottle and leave them let them go you
know but now you're just helping them to just distribute them faster that way
because since they since they they are able to to run and fly then so they have
pray to live they have some trips to find that's for sure if you have pollen
to with other plants that they will be able to survive in between yeah I've got
lots of pollen going I've got all sorts of everything going on really when it
comes down to it I've got jet right now I've got flowering
I've got flowering tomatoes right in the area here I got I've got flowering
tomatoes right in this space which is like literally I've got flowers right
there so which is good so I'll put some of this up here as well I've got jasmine
tobacco in the back I've got some I've got habanero peppers that are going
really really hard right now to what you're doing really really well I want
to make sure to get over here to in this tomato plant I've got a fair bit of
stuff that's pollinating cilantro always have one or two of those pollinating as
well and then I'm actually just gonna let them go because the main area that's
most important to me at this point in time is my weed and then I'll let it I'll
let them kind of spread out from this space more or less is kind of what I
want right yeah so which I'll give them a chance to escape a little bit maybe
put my camera on it and watch them kind of run out while I put my head
so we go on average they will be tight the adults will leave about 12 trips a
day but they will kill more than 45 if there's enough for them to hunt down so
they can like help a hot spot fast no they're really they're a good predator
for trips but now they have a competitor though when we released the other show
and it's the background crazy night especially yeah the man the crazy might
those things were awesome those were really nuts those were very very active
the crazy might are the top trips predator they did just out thrown the
aureus which is still nice and everything but and it's just it seems to
be a bit more especially for cannabis since it doesn't go into a diapause like
aureus does and it doesn't stick in the buds like aureus does the thing is to
that's another disadvantage of aureus and cannabis if you have really really
sticky buds they might stick in them oh if you have really beautiful weed I mean
that's not that's that's only gonna be a problem in flower right and if you're
running into heavy-duty pest issues in flower you probably should have tried to
do a little bit more preparation time ahead of time in my opinion anyway I
think it's it's like it's it's often forgotten to prep when you go into this
when you go into a space going into flower going in these situations and
making sure that you're ahead of time as possible the last thing you want to do
is like spray a bunch of crap on your plants in the middle of flowers just not
gonna work out right and especially now the aureus it won't work because it is
a the photoperiod thing like they will make it sleep like that it will send it
send it into a diapause so but yeah usually that's it you don't want to
sprinkle any substrate on your sticky plants but while we we are getting a
little bit tighter on time because we got Jodaherb starting in about 15
minutes so we're got about 10 minutes left before we're gonna have to run
today so I wanted to talk about this one this is something I've used for a very
long time myself and and I my first time receiving it from you guys but it's it's
the usual typical container what am I looking at here and how do we apply this
and what exactly is it it's a neocilius fallacies so neocilius fallacies is a
predatory mite that will we will use mainly against spider mites but also it
is the best one against rod mites and they also fight a bit
amprocytes mite but an amprocytes mite we haven't found any predator that's
really really efficient against it so we have to use other ways to fight the
amprocytes mite but the brown mite it really does a really good job and
fallacies also it was it was discovered in Ontario in fact in Canada so it is
indigenous to Canada. Canada's for the bug people eh? like we seem to be
consistent here is it definitely are we. They survive they can survive harsh
winters so me my first experience with fallacies was in raspberries so we would
I would advise my farmers that the organic farmers that we didn't want to
use any miticide or a parasite so to use fallacies so we would introduce early in
the season fallacies and so it established itself usually in the field
so they would become indigenous I mean they're indigenous but I mean they
would become residents of the field it didn't work as well with strawberries
because the strawberry fields will move around but the raspberry field it lasts
for 10-15 years or more sometimes so they would be found the next year by the
scout that were good to observe the things that they would find them again
so the beauty also of fallacies is that it eats pollen too so it survives on
pollen so if it has no prey around it will eat pollen also the thing is about it is
that it is a very good meticulous cleaner so let's say you have a spider
mite infestation that happens and you want to save it your plants and you want
to try to fight it so a good advice is to use persimmon is because it will go
persimmon is is another predator in mite it's more known than fallacies and they
are able to walk across spider mite webs not fallacies though that's a it's not
one of his abilities but so usually if you have a spider mite problem I would
when my dream team is fallacies and persimmon is together because persimmon
is will walk across webs and will is voracious and will eat a lot and will
take care of hot spots but it will always have one or two leftovers or
something just enough to restart the problem again but if you pair him with
fallacies fallacies just cleans up everything it just is a really
meticulous and will go after all the eggs have been left over or the remaining
spider mite that was just happened to be left out of the the the mass the spider
the person is massacred it just happened so so that's it I think that's a super
important point that a lot of people don't usually get is like a lot of the
predator mites and bugs that you have like they don't usually clear the space
completely they leave some for their next generation to feed on they they're
they're they're more intelligent than we take them for like hey yeah let's make
sure there's some for my kids it's an intelligent move and I think I didn't
know that and fallacies would come in clear it so well and I've used them in
conjunction before but this that that's a great explanation as to why yeah and
then the thing is is that that's the only that real disadvantage I find is
that it doesn't walk across web like person is will do but the other the
other things it's it's really like it's able to withstand different temperatures
too they will like still consume 2 to 16 spider mites each day so they still eat
a lot even it's like the what did I want to say about it the usually they
they're carried we used to supply them on bean leaves the fallacies because
usually we rear there's no method of rearing classes that were we had to grow
bean plants then we rear spider mites on him then on top of that we were the
phalluses so we used to sell being like bean leaf format so it would be all in a
clear plastic container all these bean leaves that would be piled up with the
phalluses and some of their lunch so the people preparing the orders would be
doing averages to make sure that there's enough phalluses compared to
spider mite to be able to so it would be a lunch for them while they're being
transported to the location where they're they have been ordered but we
everybody pretty much has dropped that format so now it used to be a format
with vermiculite now we found they found another way to not use vermiculite
a better substitute for it to to carry them around so their optimum temperature
range is really wide it's like from 9 Celsius to 32 Celsius and from the egg
to the adult takes about seven days if the temperature is all right and the
female will lay about one five eggs every day but for about 20 to maybe even
16 or a lifetime and that's it they won't they want to they won't control
spider mite when the webbing is established so so this is have to we
have to check they will go after trips a bit too but I wouldn't use them again
just against trips so I will use them for brown mites spider mites cyclamen
mite things like that but not should I putting these next to the aureus or
should I separate them a little bit when I'm putting them down they are
compatible in the way in the sense that I think aureus will eat their eggs but
they don't I don't think they attack each other but before we go because this
is a good one can demand and asked what's the proper humidity for you
mentioned temperature but I don't know if I didn't catch a humidity rain okay
okay for for phalluses like the prefers they need at least 60% to be able to lay
their eggs usually it's like it is the preferred their preferred like that to
be able these predatory mites they need a bit of the humidity always to so
successful egg laying like really really corresponds like with increased humidity
so the more you can give it but you know we have to watch whatever you grow
you know you don't want you want a good VPD or your plants no one's bringing
conditions for part of me new or things like that but if you have increased
immunity for sure they will appreciate that and they'll have a better egg laying
yeah yeah well I mean you can always just compensate your VPD by increasing
your temperature up within that way you can increase that humidity and have that
VPD deficit that'll be necessary for if we get it down to the 50s is it in effect
is it less than if it how much like is it is it greatly less than effective
when the lower humidities or are you like I mean it's just I mean it's just
that you will have to reintroduce them if you need them on the long run they're
not gonna repopulate properly in other words that's it if you want it's about
per square meter or two to two pair of ten square feet so that is usually it's
the rate and there's no other rate because we just use them preventively in
fact or paired with somebody else like person somebody else some other
predatory might like person minutes or the new our newcomer to crazy might the
whirling dervish and I do suggest everybody go check that out that was it
that was pretty epic I did get I did eventually get a great shot of one like
nun chuck tossing an aphid across the space which was pretty cool yeah I did I
did I pretty sure I linked you in it and they needed did a little video too we
got one at least one good little video of that anyways but Claude I gotta say
thank you again this has been awesome and I appreciate it so we're gonna catch
you again in a couple weeks on clubhouse with us on the Dank Hour right
and before we go where can people get ahold of you where can we support you
and where can we see what's going on with you so you can find me on LinkedIn
for sure Claude Rabat from Enetsis Bioprotection they could go on our
website it's gonna be online next week our new website and that's
bioprotection.com so a n a t i s b i o t and that's like end-user any customer
can access it yet we have an online store too in Canada you can order from
us you'll be able to order less than a hundred sachets of mites yes there's we
have 25 and 50 and 100 you hear that everybody I think you'll make 90% of our
audience the pump to hear that because all of us are tired of paying $100 for a
thousand growers you will find us under medicinal plant because PayPal didn't
like us to mention in cannabis but this is all gonna be to change soon and the
thing is also they can find me at Lyft Expo in Toronto in May and about next
week and then after that they are do cannabis in Toronto and Mississauga and
first of June to the 3rd of June then after that I'm with our boot and I'm
gonna be a speaker at cannabis wiki in London and on the 15 and 16 of June and
then grow up on the 20 turn of June in Victoria which I hope to meet you in
person yes hopefully we'll be there together if not we will make sure to try
and connect at some point here there's actually gonna be this I just found out
about this thing in a and you should check it out too it's called the
unicorn cup it's I think it's like it's second or third year doing it they might
have some issues during COVID apparently Kevin Jodery and a few people are coming
up so we're probably gonna try and simulcast that so do check it out there
we unfortunately have to end this show but don't go anywhere actually you do
have to go one place and that is over to channel 2 to jump in on Joe to Herbs
talk about data analysis I hope everybody's excited about that one I
actually am because the guys a data geek so if there's anybody to learn off
a data analysis it'll totally be him so again I thank you again Claude I look
forward to seeing you again next week and we will connect in face-to-face for
reals at some point and release a surprise release of brown lace wings
yes you're a fits too okay cool yes we will do that we'll do that soon as well
because we got a fight those those are getting those are gonna get bad all
right appreciate each and every one of
