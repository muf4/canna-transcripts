[00:00.000 --> 00:11.180]  Can you do a favor and pack a bag for me to use for a press?
[00:11.180 --> 00:12.180]  Is there one already packed?
[00:12.180 --> 00:13.180]  No, I got to pack it.
[00:13.180 --> 00:14.180]  Okay.
[00:14.180 --> 00:15.180]  Alright, so.
[00:15.180 --> 00:19.740]  So first of all, what flower is this?
[00:19.740 --> 00:20.740]  This is MK.
[00:20.740 --> 00:21.740]  Yeah, that's the MK91.
[00:21.740 --> 00:23.740]  MK91 is what it is.
[00:23.740 --> 00:29.260]  It's a cross that we have from our friends here.
[00:29.260 --> 00:32.500]  I think it's tri-state distribution right here.
[00:32.500 --> 00:36.820]  So it's Royal Reserve.
[00:36.820 --> 00:37.820]  These are different types.
[00:37.820 --> 00:38.820]  So yes, Royal Reserve and we have different flowers.
[00:38.820 --> 00:39.820]  And by the way, your name is Dax, right?
[00:39.820 --> 00:40.820]  Right.
[00:40.820 --> 00:41.820]  And that's the Dax Tractor.
[00:41.820 --> 00:42.820]  That's the Dax Tractor.
[00:42.820 --> 00:43.820]  It's almost like you're the dude who built this.
[00:43.820 --> 00:44.820]  Yeah, I guess since I have this hat on, right?
[00:44.820 --> 00:45.820]  That's my weed too.
[00:45.820 --> 00:46.820]  We put it in a Gist Mash.
[00:46.820 --> 00:47.820]  Alright, so.
[00:47.820 --> 00:48.820]  This is you?
[00:48.820 --> 00:49.820]  Oh no, the weed that we smashed into the day in the Zenith.
[00:49.820 --> 00:50.820]  Oh, that's my weed.
[00:50.820 --> 00:51.820]  Oh, that's your weed?
[00:51.820 --> 00:52.820]  Yeah.
[00:52.820 --> 00:53.820]  Oh, that's my weed.
[00:53.820 --> 00:54.820]  Oh, that's your weed?
[00:54.820 --> 00:55.820]  Yeah.
[00:55.820 --> 00:56.820]  Oh, that's my weed.
[00:56.820 --> 00:57.820]  Oh, that's your weed?
[00:57.820 --> 00:58.820]  Yeah, that's the weed we smashed into the day in the Zenith.
[00:58.820 --> 00:59.820]  The one we're doing is yours?
[00:59.820 --> 01:00.820]  That's my weed that I put in at some Alien Labs.
[01:00.820 --> 01:01.820]  So what is this right here?
[01:01.820 --> 01:02.820]  That's some Biscotti.
[01:02.820 --> 01:03.820]  Biscotti.
[01:03.820 --> 01:04.820]  And Galactic Gas, which is 41 and 25 gelato cross.
[01:04.820 --> 01:05.820]  Fuck yeah, what's your name?
[01:05.820 --> 01:06.820]  Choochoo.
[01:06.820 --> 01:07.820]  You got an Instagram?
[01:07.820 --> 01:08.820]  Yep, I-T-S-C-H-O-O-C-H-O-O.
[01:08.820 --> 01:09.820]  It's Choochoo.
[01:09.820 --> 01:10.820]  Alright.
[01:10.820 --> 01:11.820]  That's the weed we're smoking right now.
[01:11.820 --> 01:12.820]  Word up.
[01:12.820 --> 01:13.820]  And if you're also looking for the Dax Tractor, you can go on the Instagram.
[01:13.820 --> 01:14.820]  It's just Dax Tractor.
[01:14.820 --> 01:15.820]  Same with the website.
[01:15.820 --> 01:17.460]  C-H-O-O-C-H-O-O.
[01:17.460 --> 01:18.260]  It's choo-choo.
[01:18.260 --> 01:18.760]  All right.
[01:18.760 --> 01:20.500]  That's weed we're smoking right now.
[01:20.500 --> 01:21.500]  Word up.
[01:21.500 --> 01:23.620]  And if you're also looking on for the Dackstractor,
[01:23.620 --> 01:24.780]  you can go on the Instagram.
[01:24.780 --> 01:25.980]  It's just Dackstractor.
[01:25.980 --> 01:28.020]  Same with the website.
[01:28.020 --> 01:28.980]  When did you build this?
[01:28.980 --> 01:29.780]  Recently?
[01:29.780 --> 01:33.300]  So I've been making hash since, like, 1994.
[01:33.300 --> 01:36.660]  I started with a friend of mine in Columbus, Ohio.
[01:36.660 --> 01:38.900]  He owns a company called Eden Labs.
[01:38.900 --> 01:40.700]  It still exists in Washington.
[01:40.700 --> 01:43.020]  They do CO2 extracts.
[01:43.020 --> 01:45.300]  I've smoked every type of hash in the world.
[01:45.300 --> 01:48.980]  I'm a connoisseur of fine extracts.
[01:48.980 --> 01:52.660]  I've been, at a young age, someone's guinea pig.
[01:52.660 --> 01:54.220]  Eden Labs helped me get there.
[01:54.220 --> 01:56.380]  And they do CO2.
[01:56.380 --> 01:57.620]  People do butane.
[01:57.620 --> 02:00.060]  People do alcohol extracts.
[02:00.060 --> 02:03.180]  I personally like solventless extracts.
[02:03.180 --> 02:08.500]  So lucky for me, I married my wife over here.
[02:08.500 --> 02:12.940]  This is, put you on the spot.
[02:12.980 --> 02:13.980]  Can you blow a kiss?
[02:17.220 --> 02:23.700]  So without my wife, I basically couldn't be right here
[02:23.700 --> 02:27.780]  because her uncle is my, you know, I'm an artist.
[02:27.780 --> 02:30.580]  So I drew up the plan and came up with the whole design.
[02:30.580 --> 02:34.100]  But he's my engineer and my machinist.
[02:34.100 --> 02:36.180]  They have a machine company, a machine shop,
[02:36.180 --> 02:37.900]  in Johnstown, Ohio.
[02:37.900 --> 02:39.860]  And they build my equipment.
[02:39.860 --> 02:41.820]  And Rosentech is my distributor.
[02:41.820 --> 02:43.500]  So I invented this.
[02:43.500 --> 02:48.540]  And basically, it's built to press flour, bubble hash,
[02:48.540 --> 02:52.140]  and dry sift is what I prefer, which is the three
[02:52.140 --> 02:54.420]  solventless hashes you can make.
[02:54.420 --> 02:57.980]  Tell me, like, there were presses on the market.
[02:57.980 --> 03:01.900]  So like, what were you like, I want a press that does this.
[03:01.900 --> 03:03.380]  Like, what was the this?
[03:03.380 --> 03:05.180]  Well, when I started building this press,
[03:05.180 --> 03:07.660]  there wasn't any presses on the market.
[03:07.660 --> 03:09.740]  So in Ohio, it's pretty underground.
[03:09.740 --> 03:12.180]  We're only medical just this year.
[03:12.180 --> 03:14.220]  But I've been making hash, like I said,
[03:14.220 --> 03:18.540]  for a long time in legal places.
[03:18.540 --> 03:21.820]  So as an engineer, like, what were you,
[03:21.820 --> 03:24.620]  what did you want to, what do you want it to be able to do?
[03:24.620 --> 03:28.900]  Well, I basically came up with this design
[03:28.900 --> 03:31.100]  because I'm an artist and I needed to get high.
[03:31.100 --> 03:34.780]  But if I smoke too much product that has bad solvents in it,
[03:34.780 --> 03:37.420]  it gets me sick or it makes my skin break out
[03:37.420 --> 03:39.620]  or it makes me not healthy.
[03:39.660 --> 03:42.340]  So I wanted to do a solventless model.
[03:42.340 --> 03:47.740]  So I went ahead and invented this at my machine shop
[03:47.740 --> 03:49.580]  and in my art studio.
[03:49.580 --> 03:52.660]  And there wasn't any other companies
[03:52.660 --> 03:55.300]  other than a few hair straighteners
[03:55.300 --> 03:59.540]  and some Chinese, like, shirt presses.
[03:59.540 --> 04:03.380]  And people would modify plates to go on the shop presses,
[04:03.380 --> 04:04.940]  which I was doing in the beginning.
[04:04.980 --> 04:10.340]  But this is the only first, this is the first CNC,
[04:10.340 --> 04:13.660]  like, electric cut, carbon steel.
[04:13.660 --> 04:15.300]  There's no welds on this machine.
[04:15.300 --> 04:19.580]  It's just, it's all, it's like a fine race car,
[04:19.580 --> 04:20.700]  a fine sports car.
[04:20.700 --> 04:22.860]  It's built better than any machine out there.
[04:22.860 --> 04:26.820]  And it also is able to take 25 tons of pressures
[04:26.820 --> 04:28.740]  inside of this beast.
[04:28.740 --> 04:30.140]  And it's all American made.
[04:30.180 --> 04:35.220]  It's the hydraulics, the frame,
[04:35.220 --> 04:39.100]  all the heating elements are made by Watlow.
[04:39.100 --> 04:41.300]  Even the electronics are future designs
[04:41.300 --> 04:43.660]  from in the United States.
[04:43.660 --> 04:47.380]  SPX, the hydraulics that are inside and here
[04:47.380 --> 04:49.940]  are the best hydraulics you can get on the market.
[04:49.940 --> 04:52.660]  And I just wanted to be a solid USA product.
[04:52.700 --> 04:56.300]  Okay, so tell me what goes into making a good rod press.
[04:56.300 --> 04:58.740]  Like, what should one be looking for?
[04:58.740 --> 05:01.460]  Well, I wanted a compact machine
[05:01.460 --> 05:03.940]  that didn't take up a lot of room in my lab.
[05:03.940 --> 05:06.380]  I also wanted a machine that was quiet.
[05:06.380 --> 05:08.340]  So I invented this, so it's silent.
[05:08.340 --> 05:11.340]  And it's also a lifetime frame
[05:11.340 --> 05:13.300]  and a lifetime warranty on the hydraulics
[05:13.300 --> 05:15.180]  because I'm trying to build something
[05:15.180 --> 05:18.540]  that I can not have to reinvest my money in.
[05:18.540 --> 05:20.580]  And I also don't want to waste my money on solvents.
[05:20.580 --> 05:25.580]  So all we need is parchment paper and a filter
[05:26.060 --> 05:30.100]  and you can make really, really good hash.
[05:30.100 --> 05:31.580]  This one here was from flour
[05:31.580 --> 05:33.220]  that we've been pressing all day.
[05:34.820 --> 05:39.060]  And this is their flour, the tri-state and the rose.
[05:42.580 --> 05:43.820]  And this is a flour one.
[05:43.820 --> 05:47.700]  We also make bubble hash and hash rosin
[05:47.700 --> 05:48.980]  here at the show lab.
[05:48.980 --> 05:51.220]  We have a Rosin Tech Labs now
[05:51.220 --> 05:53.740]  and we distribute and make hash.
[05:53.740 --> 05:56.340]  So it's awesome to make the best hash.
[05:56.340 --> 05:58.020]  And we need a small machine
[05:58.020 --> 06:00.300]  because with a lot of power
[06:00.300 --> 06:05.300]  and you also have to have sometimes more power for flour.
[06:05.420 --> 06:07.900]  So this one can do flour and hash.
[06:07.900 --> 06:09.540]  So it's an all-in-one machine.
[06:09.540 --> 06:13.140]  When you're pressing, how do you like to dial it in?
[06:13.140 --> 06:18.060]  Like temperature wise, micron size, pressure?
[06:18.060 --> 06:21.340]  On the side of the machine over here, come around.
[06:21.340 --> 06:23.180]  I put the temp over here
[06:23.180 --> 06:25.020]  and this is the heating and the temp
[06:25.020 --> 06:26.900]  that you can raise and lower.
[06:26.900 --> 06:29.060]  I put it over here so no hash gets on it.
[06:29.060 --> 06:30.300]  So it's protected.
[06:30.300 --> 06:32.860]  And when you carry it, it has the Pelican case.
[06:32.860 --> 06:33.700]  So I can-
[06:33.700 --> 06:36.500]  Like 203 degrees is what you like it at?
[06:36.500 --> 06:38.580]  Today because of the heat outside
[06:38.580 --> 06:40.020]  and I think it's a good number
[06:40.020 --> 06:41.460]  for the type of humidity we have
[06:41.460 --> 06:43.300]  in the flour that we're pressing
[06:43.300 --> 06:44.900]  because it's still nice and moist
[06:44.900 --> 06:46.940]  and it'll still flow really good.
[06:46.940 --> 06:50.060]  So what do you get at lower versus higher temperature?
[06:50.060 --> 06:51.540]  So if you want to press flour,
[06:51.540 --> 06:54.180]  you can usually start around 160
[06:54.180 --> 06:55.900]  and you can take it up to 220
[06:55.900 --> 06:58.340]  or those safe temperatures.
[06:58.340 --> 07:00.020]  And if you go in between those temperatures,
[07:00.020 --> 07:01.620]  you'll get a nice terpene profile
[07:01.620 --> 07:02.780]  and a good full extract.
[07:02.780 --> 07:06.180]  But the lower number, you'll get a smaller extract
[07:06.180 --> 07:08.460]  for flour but a tastier oil.
[07:08.460 --> 07:10.060]  And a little higher will be a little bit more
[07:10.060 --> 07:11.580]  of an extract with more highness,
[07:11.580 --> 07:15.300]  like more, it's more of a percentage on the extract.
[07:15.340 --> 07:16.940]  And what do you like to do it at?
[07:16.940 --> 07:19.220]  I press my flour.
[07:19.220 --> 07:20.900]  So if I'm pressing flour,
[07:20.900 --> 07:24.620]  I like to press my flour about eight days off the plant,
[07:24.620 --> 07:28.580]  maybe about 55%, 60% humidity in the plant still.
[07:28.580 --> 07:30.780]  And I press it at about 180.
[07:30.780 --> 07:32.660]  And I usually press it into a jar
[07:32.660 --> 07:36.180]  and I put it in a lid on it as soon as I can
[07:36.180 --> 07:37.380]  once the jar is filled
[07:37.380 --> 07:38.620]  and I'll either jar tech it
[07:38.620 --> 07:41.580]  or I'll just cold tech like a natural cure on it.
[07:41.580 --> 07:43.380]  And that's my favorite way for both.
[07:44.220 --> 07:46.300]  Well, that's the rosin one for the flour.
[07:46.300 --> 07:47.140]  You know rosin?
[07:47.140 --> 07:49.860]  So for you, you either need to be growing yourself
[07:49.860 --> 07:52.260]  or have friends who get to you that early, right?
[07:52.260 --> 07:54.780]  It helps if you wanna have the best hash.
[07:54.780 --> 07:56.300]  You can still go to the dispensary
[07:56.300 --> 07:58.300]  and buy hash plants or flour
[07:58.300 --> 08:00.500]  and it still will yield and taste good.
[08:00.500 --> 08:03.620]  But if you're picky and you want the best to sell,
[08:03.620 --> 08:06.420]  you should grow your own or know somebody that grows.
[08:06.420 --> 08:09.500]  So you're pressing before it even really starts curing.
[08:09.500 --> 08:12.540]  Right, because I want the terpenes to still be there.
[08:12.820 --> 08:16.100]  So the older they get, the less they degrade.
[08:16.980 --> 08:19.900]  And then my favorite type of hash is bubble hash.
[08:19.900 --> 08:21.900]  It's a live bubble hash.
[08:21.900 --> 08:24.580]  So we do, we take basically the plant.
[08:24.580 --> 08:26.380]  I didn't know you made a press.
[08:26.380 --> 08:27.940]  You're more of a bubble hash guy.
[08:27.940 --> 08:30.980]  Well, I made a press because to make my bubble hash better,
[08:30.980 --> 08:33.660]  I need to make a press and I need it to be perfect
[08:33.660 --> 08:35.380]  because the hash is really expensive.
[08:35.380 --> 08:37.580]  So if the plates are not right
[08:37.580 --> 08:39.420]  or the dimensions aren't right
[08:39.420 --> 08:41.100]  and the machine's not right,
[08:41.100 --> 08:42.500]  you know, the hash won't be good.
[08:43.460 --> 08:45.540]  I basically, you can make it with a hair straightener,
[08:45.540 --> 08:47.140]  but you're gonna lose a lot.
[08:47.140 --> 08:49.340]  Or you can make it with almost any of these presses,
[08:49.340 --> 08:51.180]  but if you're in a lab and you're doing a lot,
[08:51.180 --> 08:53.220]  you're gonna lose a little bit, maybe 1%.
[08:53.220 --> 08:56.260]  It's a lot on a long run, you know, a lot of running.
[08:56.260 --> 09:00.140]  So basically, I like live rosin the best
[09:00.140 --> 09:03.660]  because you take the plant when it's growing,
[09:03.660 --> 09:06.700]  when it's done, ready to harvest, instead of drying it,
[09:06.700 --> 09:08.940]  you trim it while it's on the plant,
[09:08.940 --> 09:11.780]  you put it into a freezer bag, you freeze it,
[09:11.780 --> 09:13.980]  and then you wash it bubble hash wise,
[09:13.980 --> 09:17.780]  you wash it and you put it in a freeze dryer.
[09:17.780 --> 09:20.500]  And what that does is dries your bubble hash faster
[09:20.500 --> 09:22.460]  so the turps are better.
[09:22.460 --> 09:26.500]  And then you wait 24 hours, usually, maybe 36.
[09:26.500 --> 09:30.060]  And depending on where you live, it's very humid
[09:30.060 --> 09:31.860]  and you go from there.
[09:31.860 --> 09:33.420]  Hey, Nika T.
[09:33.420 --> 09:34.260]  Yo, Nika.
[09:37.620 --> 09:38.860]  So this guy right here.
[09:38.980 --> 09:41.220]  I definitely know this guy.
[09:42.220 --> 09:45.900]  Yo, yo, come here, I'm video right now, brother.
[09:47.540 --> 09:49.100]  We got you on a video, let's do it.
[09:49.100 --> 09:52.060]  This is Nika T, he's a world renowned hash maker.
[09:52.060 --> 09:53.500]  I think we've met before.
[09:53.500 --> 09:55.780]  He's been around, he's used the Dextractor
[09:55.780 --> 09:59.180]  and we make this product for hash makers like us
[09:59.180 --> 10:02.860]  that need the best machine because we don't wanna have
[10:02.860 --> 10:04.860]  something to break on us during the middle of our making
[10:04.860 --> 10:06.820]  or squashing, it could get stuck
[10:06.860 --> 10:08.180]  or the hose could break, whatever.
[10:08.180 --> 10:11.380]  But I just wanted to let you say hi to him real quick.
[10:11.380 --> 10:13.700]  Talk to me about pressing hash
[10:13.700 --> 10:15.780]  because you don't have to press it, right?
[10:15.780 --> 10:18.820]  So once that freeze dryer dries that hash,
[10:18.820 --> 10:21.500]  it's straight up blonde bubble hash, really crispy.
[10:21.500 --> 10:22.660]  It's usually full melt.
[10:22.660 --> 10:26.420]  I like to take that full melt or four star, five star,
[10:26.420 --> 10:30.380]  and I like to take that, put it into a 25 micron bag,
[10:30.380 --> 10:31.700]  like one of these.
[10:33.380 --> 10:36.460]  And basically, if you fill this up with bubble hash,
[10:37.100 --> 10:37.940]  you can put it right in here.
[10:37.940 --> 10:42.020]  And if it's live, like I said, live material,
[10:42.020 --> 10:44.140]  the terpenes are gonna be higher than normal
[10:44.140 --> 10:47.460]  and it's also gonna be a very neon in color.
[10:47.460 --> 10:49.180]  Depending, it could be purple even,
[10:49.180 --> 10:51.860]  depending on what flour you're pressing
[10:51.860 --> 10:53.580]  or what type of bubble hash you're pressing.
[10:53.580 --> 10:56.940]  So we put it in a jar as quick as possible
[10:56.940 --> 11:00.260]  and that preserves all the terps.
[11:00.260 --> 11:03.180]  People sometimes put it in a heat oven
[11:03.180 --> 11:05.580]  and then turn it into more of a saucy diamond
[11:05.580 --> 11:08.660]  or you can just cold cure it and it's more of a batter.
[11:08.660 --> 11:11.220]  But both are some of the best hashes in the world,
[11:11.220 --> 11:12.620]  in my opinion.
[11:12.620 --> 11:14.220]  And this machine is what you need.
[11:14.220 --> 11:15.540]  What do you currently like?
[11:15.540 --> 11:20.540]  Who's cannabis with what terpene profile
[11:20.740 --> 11:22.300]  are you digging right now?
[11:22.300 --> 11:25.620]  Well, I'm not from Cali, so I'm from Ohio.
[11:25.620 --> 11:28.460]  So I smoke a lot of Michigan hash.
[11:28.460 --> 11:31.460]  Michigan right now has got some of the best solventless hash
[11:31.460 --> 11:33.660]  that I can find on the market.
[11:33.940 --> 11:35.980]  And there's multiple...
[11:35.980 --> 11:39.260]  Because we're like hard workers in the Midwest, I think,
[11:39.260 --> 11:42.860]  and they make a lot of stupid laws that we gotta go around.
[11:42.860 --> 11:45.780]  So we gotta hide in our basements and make bubble hash,
[11:45.780 --> 11:47.660]  but we've gotten so good at it.
[11:47.660 --> 11:49.140]  It's just how we make our hash.
[11:49.140 --> 11:51.220]  But the rest of the world bought
[11:51.220 --> 11:53.020]  all the fancy butane equipment
[11:53.020 --> 11:55.940]  and they're making shatter and they're making diamonds
[11:55.940 --> 11:59.340]  while we're back here making water hash still.
[11:59.340 --> 12:01.220]  But we had to make it better than theirs.
[12:01.220 --> 12:02.540]  So that's where we're at.
[12:02.900 --> 12:06.660]  Talk about what are the strains in Michigan
[12:06.660 --> 12:10.260]  that you're pressing or doing bubble hash with.
[12:10.260 --> 12:12.020]  So I have a lot of favorites from Michigan.
[12:12.020 --> 12:15.900]  I have a friend, his name's How a Flower Grows.
[12:15.900 --> 12:20.100]  He and a bunch of other of his friends I've met,
[12:20.100 --> 12:24.220]  basically SHO, Rosin, we have Superior.
[12:24.220 --> 12:27.180]  We have, I mean, I could go down a huge list,
[12:27.180 --> 12:31.100]  but my favorite ones are Purple Pebbles.
[12:31.100 --> 12:32.580]  And then they have a Motor Breath,
[12:32.580 --> 12:36.060]  which is really good in Michigan and it's really gassy.
[12:36.060 --> 12:37.900]  And then the Purple Pebbles taste
[12:37.900 --> 12:40.340]  just like Purple Pebbles cereal when you hit it.
[12:40.340 --> 12:43.140]  Like, it's unbelievable,
[12:43.140 --> 12:46.220]  but that's just my favorite probably too up there.
[12:46.220 --> 12:50.940]  The GMO is really good, which is Garlic Mild Odor is GMO.
[12:50.940 --> 12:53.260]  And it tastes like old man's breath, really.
[12:53.260 --> 12:56.300]  It's like really gassy with a stinky, stinky finish,
[12:56.300 --> 12:57.540]  but it gets you high as fuck.
[12:57.540 --> 12:58.780]  It's super gassy.
[12:58.820 --> 13:01.180]  So you're in California today.
[13:01.180 --> 13:03.980]  So how would you compare kind of like Michigan,
[13:03.980 --> 13:05.900]  Ohio and California weed?
[13:08.540 --> 13:10.260]  A little bit more heady.
[13:10.260 --> 13:11.420]  Here?
[13:11.420 --> 13:14.340]  More, no, more recreational here.
[13:14.340 --> 13:16.420]  Maybe a little bit more heady in the Midwest
[13:16.420 --> 13:18.260]  because smaller batch.
[13:18.260 --> 13:20.500]  So with marijuana, you can pay a little bit more attention
[13:20.500 --> 13:21.660]  with it and hand trim it,
[13:21.660 --> 13:24.220]  where a lot of the stuff I see out here,
[13:24.220 --> 13:25.460]  people are doing big batch
[13:25.460 --> 13:27.300]  and they have machines that trim it.
[13:27.340 --> 13:29.700]  And so the trichomes get knocked off.
[13:29.700 --> 13:30.860]  But it's really good weed.
[13:30.860 --> 13:32.620]  I'm not putting any Cali weed down.
[13:32.620 --> 13:37.140]  And a lot of Cali has, you know, small grows as well.
[13:37.140 --> 13:38.820]  So no, I just am new here.
[13:38.820 --> 13:40.380]  So I haven't been out here as much,
[13:40.380 --> 13:42.620]  but people here have definitely made some really good weed.
[13:42.620 --> 13:43.660]  Oh, you've been smoking the weed,
[13:43.660 --> 13:44.500]  so you haven't been in a...
[13:44.500 --> 13:45.340]  It's good.
[13:45.340 --> 13:47.620]  All this is really good weed for sure.
[13:50.900 --> 13:52.020]  I'm just partial to...
[13:52.020 --> 13:53.060]  It's the Midwest boys.
[13:53.060 --> 13:55.540]  I know, so give some love to the Midwest.
[13:55.540 --> 13:56.380]  Yeah.
[13:56.420 --> 13:59.060]  What is she like to smoke in the Midwest?
[13:59.060 --> 14:00.700]  What is the wife like?
[14:00.700 --> 14:02.260]  Does he know you?
[14:02.260 --> 14:04.420]  Yes, let her guess this.
[14:04.420 --> 14:06.860]  So I'll whisper it to you.
[14:06.860 --> 14:08.380]  What she likes.
[14:08.380 --> 14:10.660]  She likes lemon G13.
[14:10.660 --> 14:12.020]  Okay, what do you like?
[14:12.020 --> 14:13.500]  Are you gonna say apricot?
[14:13.500 --> 14:14.340]  No.
[14:14.340 --> 14:15.180]  What's your real favorite?
[14:15.180 --> 14:16.020]  Oh, lemon G.
[14:17.100 --> 14:18.100]  You got it.
[14:18.100 --> 14:19.340]  What's my favorite?
[14:19.340 --> 14:20.540]  Death Star.
[14:20.540 --> 14:21.380]  Death Star?
[14:21.380 --> 14:22.660]  My favorite's Death Star.
[14:22.660 --> 14:25.700]  So we're gonna smash this guy's fucking shit here.
[14:26.980 --> 14:28.380]  Slimey.
[14:28.380 --> 14:30.300]  What's the name of this variety again?
[14:30.300 --> 14:32.660]  Oh, so that's Biscotti and Galactic Gats.
[14:33.660 --> 14:34.500]  Biscotti.
[14:35.660 --> 14:36.980]  Galactic Gats.
[14:36.980 --> 14:37.900]  Galactic Gats.
[14:37.900 --> 14:42.580]  Yeah, so the Alien Labs connected cannabis grain.
[14:44.140 --> 14:45.380]  Hell yeah.
[14:45.380 --> 14:47.860]  All right, so what temperature are we doing?
[14:47.860 --> 14:50.540]  We have it right now at 203 degrees,
[14:50.540 --> 14:53.660]  which I think would be a good terping and a good yield.
[14:53.660 --> 14:55.260]  And then what about the...
[14:55.380 --> 14:57.020]  Can you dial the pressure?
[14:57.020 --> 14:59.700]  Yes, so the dialing the pressure is very key.
[14:59.700 --> 15:03.020]  So you wanna take it slow at first and build the pressure.
[15:03.020 --> 15:06.060]  Because we have about, how much marijuana do we have here?
[15:06.060 --> 15:09.940]  About maybe 10 grams maybe?
[15:09.940 --> 15:12.340]  I'd say 10 grams by guesstimate.
[15:12.340 --> 15:15.620]  So 10 grams, you don't need as much as an ounce.
[15:15.620 --> 15:18.940]  An ounce I'll take all the way up to 20 tons.
[15:18.940 --> 15:20.140]  Because this is smaller,
[15:20.140 --> 15:22.780]  the pressure is only on this amount of space,
[15:22.780 --> 15:24.100]  so it's less space taken up.
[15:24.100 --> 15:25.500]  So you need a little bit less pressure.
[15:25.500 --> 15:28.620]  So I'll take this up to about eight tons of pressure,
[15:28.620 --> 15:30.020]  which is right here.
[15:30.020 --> 15:32.380]  And you can do that with only two pumps.
[15:32.380 --> 15:34.740]  Once the plates are together, about two pumps.
[15:48.910 --> 15:50.830]  So I'll move around here to the front.
[16:15.140 --> 16:17.700]  All right, so this is a hand press, I like it.
[16:17.700 --> 16:19.980]  Yes, so we can take it nice and slow.
[16:19.980 --> 16:20.820]  I love it.
[16:20.820 --> 16:21.940]  It's already gushing.
[16:28.160 --> 16:30.000]  So what are you feeling for?
[16:30.360 --> 16:33.560]  Right there I was just holding it open so you could see it.
[16:33.560 --> 16:34.920]  And I wanted to show you that drip.
[16:34.920 --> 16:35.960]  I got it, I got it.
[16:37.040 --> 16:38.280]  Yeah, that's that.
[16:38.280 --> 16:40.720]  I want to watch it go down.
[16:40.720 --> 16:43.280]  So that's a really good sign when you see it drip like that,
[16:43.280 --> 16:45.120]  because he's got mad terps.
[16:45.120 --> 16:46.440]  And mad THC.
[16:46.440 --> 16:47.280]  Woo!
[16:48.680 --> 16:49.520]  Big drip.
[16:51.520 --> 16:52.840]  And if you see right here.
[16:52.840 --> 16:55.400]  I'm excited right now, so excited to smoke this.
[16:55.400 --> 16:56.720]  Look at that.
[16:56.720 --> 16:57.560]  Smell that.
[16:57.680 --> 16:59.000]  I didn't know that.
[16:59.000 --> 17:00.360]  Smell that.
[17:00.360 --> 17:01.760]  Smell the terp stuff, man.
[17:06.540 --> 17:21.700]  Yeah, that's good.
[17:29.820 --> 17:31.220]  We smashed that.
[17:31.220 --> 17:35.220]  It's about as much as you could smash a bag for the size.
[17:35.220 --> 17:38.020]  And the extract is clean, as you can see.
[17:46.770 --> 17:47.610]  Oh yes.
[17:47.650 --> 17:50.010]  Yeah, this guy seems like he's a master.
[17:50.010 --> 17:52.490]  He probably makes some really good hash and stuff.
[17:52.490 --> 17:53.890]  Look at his hat right here.
[17:55.690 --> 17:57.090]  This guy obviously knows.
[17:58.210 --> 18:01.050]  Yes, Nick is a very, very, very good friend of mine, man.
[18:01.050 --> 18:02.410]  Nick and T is the family.
[18:02.410 --> 18:04.330]  The essential extracts, everybody knows.
[18:04.330 --> 18:05.650]  We're gonna have some nice hash.
[18:05.650 --> 18:08.610]  So there's a huge hash following here.
[18:08.610 --> 18:10.210]  There's a huge hash following here.
[18:10.210 --> 18:12.410]  So talk about the hash seat, like.
[18:12.410 --> 18:13.410]  Well basically.
[18:13.410 --> 18:15.130]  You're like the Midwest hash seat.
[18:15.130 --> 18:17.570]  The reason why I'm here is because I wanted to join an army
[18:17.570 --> 18:20.930]  of hash makers and they have built a team,
[18:20.930 --> 18:24.330]  the Rosentech, the Show Labs, the Dab Nation,
[18:24.330 --> 18:26.570]  Rosentech Labs, Dax Tractor now.
[18:26.570 --> 18:27.410]  We're all a family.
[18:27.410 --> 18:28.650]  You're not really coming out to California for.
[18:28.650 --> 18:32.570]  No, I was a competitor of theirs for about three years.
[18:32.570 --> 18:35.250]  And they, I think, realized this was a machine
[18:35.250 --> 18:36.090]  they wanted to sell.
[18:36.090 --> 18:39.530]  So I've decided I'll get back to painting and doing art
[18:39.530 --> 18:42.290]  and inventing more while they sell these for me.
[18:42.290 --> 18:44.170]  And we're just gonna be a team.
[18:44.170 --> 18:47.810]  And I need a sales force like they, and a lab to use.
[18:47.810 --> 18:48.970]  And we're here.
[18:48.970 --> 18:50.130]  I think I'm moving out here.
[18:50.130 --> 18:50.970]  We'll see.
[18:50.970 --> 18:52.490]  We'll see more of me out here probably.
[18:52.490 --> 18:53.810]  Yeah, I like that.
[18:53.810 --> 18:54.730]  I support that.
[18:54.730 --> 18:55.570]  Just the white side of that.
[18:55.570 --> 18:58.090]  And we don't waste these either, so.
[18:58.090 --> 18:59.650]  Do you wanna move to LA?
[19:02.290 --> 19:03.570]  Will you miss Ohio?
[19:04.730 --> 19:05.970]  The winter?
[19:05.970 --> 19:07.570]  Oh, I was gonna say that as well.
[19:07.570 --> 19:09.450]  She's gonna cry if you ask her that.
[19:11.690 --> 19:13.450]  Yeah, so we don't waste these either.
[19:13.450 --> 19:15.930]  We take them and we collect them.
[19:15.930 --> 19:19.690]  After the show, we collect these and we donate them.
[19:19.690 --> 19:22.770]  We either make them into food product by,
[19:22.770 --> 19:25.010]  soak them in alcohol and make a tincture
[19:25.010 --> 19:26.810]  or like a coconut oil.
[19:26.810 --> 19:27.890]  Because there's a lot of terpenes,
[19:27.890 --> 19:30.450]  a lot of stuff stuck in the bags still.
[19:30.450 --> 19:31.930]  And you can make a lot of tincture,
[19:31.930 --> 19:33.170]  whether it's food grade,
[19:33.170 --> 19:34.530]  or you can make it for whatever,
[19:34.530 --> 19:35.850]  if you're pressing hemp.
[19:35.850 --> 19:36.690]  You can make it for CBD, whatever.
[19:36.690 --> 19:40.810]  So here, this would go back to the RosinTech headquarters
[19:40.810 --> 19:41.930]  and they would give us.
[19:41.930 --> 19:42.770]  This is our, what'd you say?
[19:43.130 --> 19:46.210]  No, no, no, the recycled, like the used.
[19:46.210 --> 19:47.730]  It depends on where we're at.
[19:47.730 --> 19:49.690]  So if we're at a place doing it,
[19:49.690 --> 19:52.330]  they keep their product because it's their product.
[19:52.330 --> 19:53.170]  If we're at a-
[19:53.170 --> 19:54.010]  Well, tonight, here we're in LA.
[19:54.010 --> 19:55.370]  Tonight, this is our product.
[19:55.370 --> 19:57.010]  So this is product we own.
[19:57.010 --> 19:59.690]  So we're gonna probably keep it and donate it.
[19:59.690 --> 20:00.970]  Somebody is what I think.
[20:00.970 --> 20:02.250]  So like in LA.
[20:02.250 --> 20:04.410]  Yeah, or friends or family.
[20:04.410 --> 20:05.250]  Okay.
[20:05.250 --> 20:07.810]  So whoever is worthy or whoever is around, I guess.
[20:07.810 --> 20:08.650]  I don't know.
[20:08.650 --> 20:09.490]  I don't know how they handle that.
[20:09.490 --> 20:11.490]  I don't know what the rules are on donating.
[20:11.490 --> 20:15.010]  I think that it's probably family and friends, maybe.
[20:15.010 --> 20:15.970]  That makes more sense.
[20:15.970 --> 20:17.250]  Maybe me, I get to keep it.
[20:17.250 --> 20:18.290]  I don't know.
[20:18.290 --> 20:19.930]  I'm pretty nice to, I mean,
[20:19.930 --> 20:21.810]  I like to make like a salad dressing with it
[20:21.810 --> 20:23.490]  or like an oil, cause it mixes it.
[20:23.490 --> 20:26.050]  And you can keep it in a bottle in your fridge.
[20:26.050 --> 20:28.170]  Do you ever, after that first press,
[20:28.170 --> 20:29.530]  do you ever do a second press?
[20:29.530 --> 20:31.850]  Yeah, you wanna see a second press done?
[20:31.850 --> 20:34.450]  There's not a lot of oil left.
[20:34.450 --> 20:36.370]  But is that something that you normally,
[20:36.370 --> 20:38.490]  like would you smoke the second press
[20:38.490 --> 20:39.330]  or would you give it to like-
[20:39.730 --> 20:40.570]  Yeah, no, no.
[20:40.570 --> 20:41.610]  In Ohio, definitely.
[20:41.610 --> 20:43.530]  Cause there's not as much hash around.
[20:45.090 --> 20:46.770]  My second press is just as good
[20:46.770 --> 20:48.250]  as a lot of people's first press.
[20:48.250 --> 20:49.090]  I heard, yeah.
[20:49.090 --> 20:50.210]  What was your first one though?
[20:50.210 --> 20:51.050]  Dax Trector.
[20:51.050 --> 20:52.050]  Dax Trector.
[20:57.210 --> 20:58.650]  This is John Rosin here.
[20:58.650 --> 20:59.690]  He's a pimp.
[20:59.690 --> 21:01.850]  Look at this fucking box he's got.
[21:01.850 --> 21:02.730]  He looks like a pimp.
[21:02.730 --> 21:03.850]  Look at this thing.
[21:03.850 --> 21:06.530]  He's an evil hash dweller over here.
[21:06.530 --> 21:07.410]  He'll dab you out.
[21:07.410 --> 21:09.210]  You'll probably, did you do that to the lady
[21:10.090 --> 21:10.930]  that went out in the-
[21:10.930 --> 21:12.370]  So is that mahogany?
[21:12.370 --> 21:21.210]  What kind of wood is it?
[21:21.210 --> 21:22.650]  You wanna pump this one?
[21:22.650 --> 21:23.530]  Sure.
[21:23.530 --> 21:24.530]  I'll record you.
[21:26.610 --> 21:27.730]  Here, I'll record you.
[21:28.850 --> 21:29.690]  All right.
[21:29.690 --> 21:31.370]  So he's gonna pump this second press.
[21:31.370 --> 21:34.530]  So hold down here while you pump it.
[21:34.530 --> 21:36.730]  Like just right there so it doesn't come up.
[21:37.690 --> 21:38.530]  And then-
[21:38.530 --> 21:39.530]  Do you have to go slowly or-
[21:39.530 --> 21:40.850]  No, you can go fast now,
[21:40.850 --> 21:42.610]  but go ahead and take it to the 5,000.
[21:42.610 --> 21:45.410]  You'll feel it shift into second gear.
[21:45.450 --> 21:47.130]  Once these touch.
[21:47.130 --> 21:49.970]  It's easy, but now it's in second gear.
[21:52.610 --> 21:54.210]  So take it to 5,000,
[21:54.210 --> 21:56.930]  that's 12 and a half tons of pressure you're creating.
[21:58.890 --> 22:01.170]  So it's still just going down, right?
[22:01.170 --> 22:02.010]  Up.
[22:02.010 --> 22:03.650]  It's down here, so it's pushing up.
[22:03.650 --> 22:04.890]  So that's good.
[22:04.890 --> 22:05.730]  You're at almost-
[22:05.730 --> 22:07.330]  Well, you don't have to go anymore
[22:07.330 --> 22:11.290]  because right now you're at 6,000 PSI,
[22:11.330 --> 22:15.490]  which is roughly about 14 tons of pressure
[22:15.490 --> 22:18.770]  because we have a 25 ton cylinder inside of here.
[22:18.770 --> 22:20.890]  And we're gonna let it sit there.
[22:20.890 --> 22:23.050]  But this is a good video and a good thing to do
[22:23.050 --> 22:26.330]  because you'll see that the first time you press on mine,
[22:26.330 --> 22:27.730]  you get a lot of oil out
[22:27.730 --> 22:29.530]  that you don't have to do multiple presses.
[22:29.530 --> 22:31.210]  Some machines aren't strong enough.
[22:31.210 --> 22:32.970]  But so I don't need to do anything more
[22:32.970 --> 22:34.210]  and eventually it's gonna come out.
[22:34.210 --> 22:35.330]  Yeah, we're waiting for,
[22:35.330 --> 22:37.730]  to see if we got it all the first time,
[22:37.730 --> 22:40.690]  which as of right now, nothing's coming out,
[22:40.690 --> 22:42.850]  except for a little bit right there, you see it?
[22:42.850 --> 22:43.730]  So we wait for it.
[22:43.730 --> 22:45.570]  You don't wanna waste, but if we didn't do that,
[22:45.570 --> 22:46.970]  you could get that in the food product
[22:46.970 --> 22:48.610]  like I was talking about.
[22:48.610 --> 22:49.530]  So we don't waste.
[22:51.090 --> 22:53.010]  So let's do it for another 10 seconds
[22:53.010 --> 22:56.170]  and then just unscrew that left knob to the left.
[22:57.490 --> 22:59.810]  You have to kind of grip it hard and turn it.
[22:59.810 --> 23:00.690]  Can I do it now?
[23:00.690 --> 23:01.530]  Go ahead.
[23:02.810 --> 23:04.530]  You see that pressure release?
[23:04.530 --> 23:05.970]  The plates came down.
[23:11.120 --> 23:12.840]  So that's the second press.
[23:12.840 --> 23:15.240]  And you just extracted it, yeah.
[23:15.240 --> 23:18.160]  And that's how much is in each bag left to do dabs with.
[23:18.160 --> 23:19.320]  Look at that donation.
[23:19.320 --> 23:20.880]  Yeah.
[23:20.880 --> 23:21.720]  Boom.
[23:23.320 --> 23:26.120]  And that is how you do a flower rosin press.
[23:26.120 --> 23:27.720]  Oh, you wanna smell the second?
[23:31.060 --> 23:32.180]  Still smells really good.
[23:32.180 --> 23:33.820]  That's like a first press, right?
