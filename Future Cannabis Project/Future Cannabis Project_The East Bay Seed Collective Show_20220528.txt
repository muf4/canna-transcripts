[00:00.120 --> 00:15.660]  All right, good morning everyone. You, good morning. We are on, this is the East Bay Seed
[00:15.660 --> 00:23.160]  Collective show. And thanks for joining. I didn't, I haven't blazed that much this morning,
[00:23.160 --> 00:28.920]  so I'm like not, my brain isn't working. Yeah, you're on the East Bay Seed Collective show.
[00:28.920 --> 00:36.600]  Today we have Indiva and Huey Jack, who are two of the members of our collective who are
[00:36.600 --> 00:44.200]  on, and we're going to talk about how to form your own collective, important things to keep
[00:44.200 --> 00:49.720]  in mind when having a collective. We can talk about some of the issues with the collective.
[00:49.720 --> 00:56.700]  But yeah, I think it's an important topic. Perhaps we'll have another person from our
[00:56.700 --> 01:02.540]  collective, Grasshopper may be showing up to talk about some of his gear. But yeah,
[01:02.540 --> 01:06.820]  that's the purpose of today's show is to talk about working as a group.
[01:06.820 --> 01:11.420]  All right, Alexa, you ready for round two?
[01:11.420 --> 01:16.100]  Yes, so happy to be back. Thank you.
[01:16.100 --> 01:18.300]  Who was that?
[01:18.300 --> 01:21.180]  I don't know.
[01:21.180 --> 01:26.580]  Yeah, I don't know. I don't know if that was like, maybe that was Peter jumping in for a
[01:26.580 --> 01:28.020]  second doing something else.
[01:28.020 --> 01:30.500]  Yeah, it sounded like Dr. Indiva, so.
[01:30.500 --> 01:34.100]  So yeah, you guys, you guys want to jump in?
[01:35.860 --> 01:36.980]  Yeah, let's go for it.
[01:42.660 --> 01:46.980]  Okay, well, I'll just start with like the impetus of like, the reason I started this,
[01:46.980 --> 01:53.140]  the Seed Collective was because I worked at this hydro store called Berkeley Indoor Garden.
[01:53.140 --> 01:59.060]  And I would see tons of different people from the cannabis community on a daily basis.
[01:59.780 --> 02:05.780]  And I really loved seeing all these people, they're an important part of my daily life.
[02:06.580 --> 02:11.940]  And when I left Berkeley Indoor Garden, I really wanted a way to continue
[02:13.220 --> 02:20.340]  this really important community. Because these people are, you know, are an important part of
[02:20.340 --> 02:26.900]  my life. And so I decided to start up a little seed club. And initially, my thought was like,
[02:26.900 --> 02:33.700]  we could just have a little meetup, we can trade seeds, we can trade clones, we can trade buds,
[02:34.340 --> 02:38.980]  and just kind of, you know, geek out. Same thing that we would do at the shop,
[02:38.980 --> 02:42.100]  we would just, you know, be doing it somewhere else.
[02:42.580 --> 02:53.140]  And, you know, I've noticed that we had a fair amount of interest in the club. And, you know,
[02:53.140 --> 02:58.020]  something that I'm sure most of us know is that people in the cannabis community are pretty like,
[02:58.660 --> 03:03.620]  a little bit scattered and free thinkers. So I thought that we should have some sort of
[03:03.620 --> 03:09.220]  basis that's like grounding the club in a specific area, and not just doing whatever
[03:09.220 --> 03:14.180]  you wanted. So the grounding of this particular collective is in land-raised genetics.
[03:14.900 --> 03:21.620]  So essentially, the focus of our club was on promoting, cultivating, making out crosses of
[03:21.620 --> 03:27.460]  land-raised genetics. That wasn't exclusively, but that was like the base of this club. And,
[03:28.260 --> 03:33.460]  you know, from there, we decided we would do a seed library. From there, we decided we would
[03:33.460 --> 03:39.140]  start making our own crosses and sharing them with people. And, you know, it kind of just went
[03:39.140 --> 03:48.420]  from there. Yeah. Would you guys like to please chime in? What's your take on it?
[03:48.420 --> 03:58.120]  David Taylor
[03:58.120 --> 04:05.000]  Well, I mean, it just, it takes a lot of work and dedication anyways. So I mean, that's the way I
[04:05.000 --> 04:13.560]  think of it as if you guys want things going, you're just gonna have to put effort. And, but,
[04:13.560 --> 04:19.240]  you know, it's no different than growing and just sharing with your friends anyway. So I mean,
[04:19.960 --> 04:21.240]  seed collectives are wonderful.
[04:21.240 --> 04:24.420]  David Taylor
[04:24.420 --> 04:34.420]  How about you, Huey? Huey?
[04:34.420 --> 04:36.100]  Huey Levee
[04:36.100 --> 04:40.500]  I was gonna say, it's a great learning experience, because you get to see whatever
[04:40.500 --> 04:47.700]  other people do. I mean, it was kind of like in the beginning, it was, it was kind of weird,
[04:47.700 --> 04:53.380]  because like, especially when I met you guys down at the shop, you really couldn't ask grow questions
[04:53.380 --> 05:01.140]  for, you know, pre 2018, you know, and legalization. And I think that's when that happened,
[05:01.140 --> 05:05.940]  then the floodgates open. And then there's a bunch of people sitting around in the hydro shop,
[05:05.940 --> 05:13.060]  talking shop, you know, because we could talk about it, you know. And I think that that's,
[05:13.700 --> 05:20.180]  that's kind of how we all met. Or at least you and I met is, you know, we kind of talked about
[05:20.820 --> 05:25.300]  what each of every other person we're doing. And it was just interesting, you know, it's
[05:25.300 --> 05:30.100]  interesting to see what other folks were doing, how they were doing what they were growing.
[05:30.180 --> 05:37.460]  And, you know, yeah, which eventually led us to all come together in a park one day, you know.
[05:39.780 --> 05:46.900]  Yeah, 100%. I mean, like, for me, it was kind of as legalization happened, and,
[05:47.700 --> 05:56.180]  you know, the price of cannabis kind of plummeted, which was, you know, not good. The upside was that
[05:56.820 --> 06:01.220]  because it wasn't worth that much, you can then start geeking out and really just learning it for
[06:01.220 --> 06:08.980]  the sake of learning and not producing blood for the sake of profit. And, you know, really focusing
[06:08.980 --> 06:16.020]  on the community aspect. Also, you know, where we are, it's legal. So we're, you know, what we're
[06:16.020 --> 06:21.460]  doing is not illegal. So like, we didn't have to worry about, you know, letting people in the group
[06:21.460 --> 06:26.820]  who were maybe undercover cops or anything like that. Because I mean, all the things we're doing
[06:26.820 --> 06:32.660]  are legal. You know, we are not a collective that grows flowers to sell in the black market.
[06:33.300 --> 06:39.540]  You know, none of the activities that we're doing are illegal. So like, that's an important aspect
[06:39.540 --> 06:46.260]  of the club. Because, you know, if you're in a non legal state, it's not really may not be wise to
[06:46.260 --> 06:51.780]  be telling people what you're doing. But you know, if you are in a legal or medical state,
[06:52.580 --> 06:58.180]  you know, part of the laws are that you are allowed to share and gift flowers and, you know,
[06:58.180 --> 07:02.740]  plants and all these different aspects. So like that, you know, that's important. So kind of like
[07:02.740 --> 07:12.100]  as the market began to change and kind of collapse, then it gave us this opportunity to connect
[07:12.900 --> 07:19.060]  via just the plant. And I mean, that's, you know, that's powerful. And that's important,
[07:19.060 --> 07:24.100]  because that's kind of like, the reason why many of us were here in the first place was because of
[07:24.100 --> 07:29.140]  the plant and also because of this community. You know, like, that's also like another important
[07:29.140 --> 07:36.500]  part of this is like, you know, like, this is a community, like we are friends. You know, people
[07:36.500 --> 07:41.140]  in the club, if somebody's not doing well, other club members will check in on them. And like,
[07:41.140 --> 07:45.140]  that's important, because I know a lot of people in the cannabis community don't have many friends
[07:45.140 --> 07:51.940]  don't have many people to that will, you know, check on them. And I mean, shit, like as people,
[07:51.940 --> 07:57.540]  like we need that, you know, regardless if you love weed or not, like you need other people in
[07:57.540 --> 08:03.380]  your life that are, you know, that will check in on you and that, you know, make sure that you're
[08:03.380 --> 08:09.140]  okay. And that's important. I mean, I would argue that's more important than smoking weed is having
[08:09.140 --> 08:19.220]  a community. That's, you know, that's what we are. Guys, want to jump in at all? I mean,
[08:20.900 --> 08:26.180]  yeah, I'm still I'm still aggregating my coffee this morning. But But yeah, I mean, that was the
[08:26.180 --> 08:34.500]  whole point of having sorry, is, you know, having the group is the kind of forward, what we're doing
[08:34.500 --> 08:42.420]  on our own, you know, outside, but coming together to work together. You know, and it was
[08:42.420 --> 08:50.580]  kind of interesting how it all just kind of came together. At first, geeking out of restraints.
[08:50.580 --> 08:55.060]  Really, that's kind of what it was. We were just being geeks. We're being blank geeks,
[08:55.060 --> 09:01.380]  you know, and we just wanted to share what we were doing individually with other people with other
[09:01.380 --> 09:10.260]  like minded people, you know. So 100% I mean, and like, even like when you're actually so like,
[09:10.260 --> 09:15.540]  the purpose of this video or podcast was to encourage people to start their own collectives.
[09:15.540 --> 09:19.300]  But if you're going to be doing like a seed collective, which is almost, you know,
[09:19.300 --> 09:23.780]  more pertinent, you're going to have so many seeds that you really need to get them out to people to
[09:23.780 --> 09:33.780]  grow for you. And I mean, that's a super important aspect of this club is that as breeders, we share
[09:33.780 --> 09:40.980]  our genetics, and we grow them and we can talk about them. And I mean, anybody here who's who's
[09:40.980 --> 09:47.620]  bred knows that you can make so many more seeds than anything that any amount that you could test,
[09:47.700 --> 09:54.340]  you need to have people that you trust to test them. I mean, it's easy to have years of backlog.
[09:54.340 --> 10:00.180]  And so like, it's really, it's, it's really essential that you have a community of people
[10:00.180 --> 10:05.860]  that can grow that you can grow each other's gear and, you know, give each other feedback. I mean,
[10:06.420 --> 10:11.700]  I almost feel like it's like what we're doing is not anything new at all. Like it's really what
[10:12.260 --> 10:15.940]  people do wherever. I mean, farmers always have been working together,
[10:16.820 --> 10:22.980]  sharing seed and sharing product for, you know, since farming has began. It's just, you know,
[10:22.980 --> 10:27.780]  with the event of, you know, our capitalist system and all these types of things where,
[10:27.780 --> 10:34.820]  you know, everybody starts doing their own thing and siloing everything by themselves. But yeah.
[10:35.780 --> 10:42.900]  Yeah, you know, I mean, that's, that's the thing is like, come, somebody put up camaraderie,
[10:42.900 --> 10:51.540]  absolutely camaraderie. That was, that was the goal. You know, it's like, we as a group can do
[10:51.540 --> 11:01.700]  something bigger than one person can. And we can do it a lot faster. You know, as a group. So
[11:02.500 --> 11:11.220]  so somebody posted earlier is tap water. Okay. 6.2. Yeah. Your tap water is fine. Generally let
[11:11.220 --> 11:18.340]  it sit out 24 hours, but 6.2 pH tap water in Tulsa, Oklahoma, it's actually pretty damn good.
[11:18.340 --> 11:23.700]  Use that shit. I would say it depends on your area though for tap water.
[11:25.460 --> 11:30.340]  Cause you know, some areas are just stupid high, but I mean, it also depends on,
[11:30.340 --> 11:33.860]  it depends on your substrate too. If you're growing in soil, it doesn't really matter,
[11:33.860 --> 11:37.380]  but if you're growing in hydro or something, you're going to have to take into account on
[11:38.260 --> 11:42.340]  the salt buildup of the tap water for what you're adding to it.
[11:43.780 --> 11:49.940]  Getting a sample, getting a test sample of your water. So you know what's in it is a good idea too.
[11:50.820 --> 11:58.820]  Yeah. Well, ours is 8.5 and they pull it from the Delta. So yeah. No bueno.
[12:00.340 --> 12:07.620]  My 7. So how do you want to start on this? What's the topic you want to first start about?
[12:07.620 --> 12:13.220]  Like how to kind of go about sourcing a group or. Yeah. I mean, I was thinking like,
[12:13.220 --> 12:18.900]  maybe we could just go over like the top eight most important aspects to consider when starting
[12:18.900 --> 12:25.380]  a group. And we can kind of go into like, from our experience, these are the things that you need to
[12:25.380 --> 12:32.580]  keep in mind to have a successful group. That was kind of what I was thinking. When I started this
[12:32.580 --> 12:36.980]  group, I did not have any intentions on it, period. I didn't know if it was going to work at all. I
[12:36.980 --> 12:42.820]  didn't know if it was going to work for a year. You know, I really had no expectations. I just
[12:42.820 --> 12:51.460]  wanted to hang out with my friends. So as of right now, we're on like three years or so. Yeah. We're
[12:51.460 --> 12:57.540]  on three years. We made it through the pandemic. It was actually a really valuable tool during the
[12:57.540 --> 13:06.580]  pandemic so that we could stay connected and, you know, to communicate with other people and still,
[13:06.580 --> 13:14.500]  you know, be safe and whatnot. So yeah, well, let's get started. So the first thing, oh, and
[13:14.500 --> 13:22.500]  please, Nick and Jeff, like at any time, jump in with whatever, you know, please jump in. So the
[13:22.500 --> 13:28.020]  first thing is have membership fees. This is something as a group we've been working with,
[13:28.740 --> 13:35.940]  but in general, it doesn't need to be a lot, but have membership fees so that it's not one particular
[13:35.940 --> 13:43.460]  person paying for a majority of things. Just, you know, have a small fee that will pay for
[13:44.500 --> 13:50.020]  the costs that come up and trust me, you will always have costs that come up as a group.
[13:51.780 --> 13:57.700]  So that's the first one I would, first thing I would say is super important. Do you guys like
[13:57.700 --> 14:01.780]  to elaborate on that one or should I move on? Well, no, I mean, I think it's important because
[14:02.420 --> 14:07.380]  especially if you're in a group like we are with other members that are out of state,
[14:09.380 --> 14:15.620]  it's important to keep connected, obviously, you know, Zoom isn't free, you know, or at least
[14:16.260 --> 14:22.260]  the ones we use for the length of our meeting, it's not, you know, and there's other costs incurred.
[14:22.260 --> 14:29.140]  Like we have an actual meetup barbecue where we rent a spot so groups can come. So there are
[14:29.140 --> 14:35.220]  costs incurred, you know, it's probably, you know, just an infrastructure, we probably chunk
[14:35.220 --> 14:41.780]  out a good 500 bucks, you know, close to it a year, you know, and it's kind of hard for one
[14:41.780 --> 14:49.860]  person to float that, you know, we're not super rich, you know, so it's like, yeah, figure out
[14:49.860 --> 14:54.660]  what the costs are and then figure out who's going to share the cost. I think it's an important thing
[14:54.660 --> 15:00.660]  off the bat, especially if, you know, you're not meeting up on the regular and you're just,
[15:00.660 --> 15:06.740]  you're kind of coming together either through something like Zoom or another streaming service
[15:06.740 --> 15:11.460]  where you all can communicate and show each other's work. So I think kind of setting,
[15:12.180 --> 15:18.660]  you know, setting the cost up would be something to do great off the bat, which our group should
[15:18.660 --> 15:24.500]  have done and we didn't, we're trying to figure that out now. But I think it's something
[15:24.500 --> 15:27.060]  important to talk about because there are costs involved.
[15:27.060 --> 15:32.820]  100%. I mean, like these are not, like, these are the things that we're saying that we've even made
[15:32.820 --> 15:39.300]  mistakes on ourselves. This is not like us saying we're perfect because I'm, we're all learning as
[15:39.300 --> 15:45.140]  we go along, but we're just, you know, we want to, you know, push the information forward. And then
[15:45.140 --> 15:51.460]  also like, as far as costs, like, yes, you may be paying a little bit, but the amount of things that
[15:51.460 --> 15:58.820]  you receive back because of the inherent, because this is a collective is like tenfold. So let's say
[15:58.820 --> 16:04.340]  you throw down a hundred bucks per year, theoretically, you're probably getting around
[16:04.340 --> 16:11.460]  a thousand dollars worth of information, seeds, all different kinds of things in return from that
[16:11.460 --> 16:16.660]  hundred dollars. Easily a thousand worth of all of those things coming back to you. So like,
[16:16.660 --> 16:23.940]  that's an important concept to think about. Going into the next one, vetting process. This is super
[16:23.940 --> 16:28.420]  important to figure out how you're going to let people in the group because you can't let anybody
[16:28.420 --> 16:35.460]  in your group and you don't want to allow your group to get messed up by not the right energy.
[16:35.460 --> 16:42.100]  And that literally is whatever energy you decide to have into your group. And, you know,
[16:42.100 --> 16:48.260]  there are important ways of vetting. One of the easiest ones for me is to look at people's
[16:48.260 --> 16:53.700]  Instagram account. You can very often from their Instagram account, see how long they've been doing
[16:53.700 --> 16:59.140]  things. Now, this isn't the only thing that you should look into, but it's definitely a good thing
[16:59.140 --> 17:05.860]  to kind of get an idea of like what kind of strains they're into, if they're constantly causing drama,
[17:05.860 --> 17:09.460]  all different kinds of things. And especially with our group, because it's anchored in land
[17:09.460 --> 17:13.700]  race genetics, if people are really in the land race genetics, they're going to be posting about
[17:13.700 --> 17:21.060]  it. And you can guarantee that police officers are not going to be posting about land race genetics.
[17:21.620 --> 17:27.780]  You'll be able to see all the things that they're geeking out about. And if they're following the
[17:27.780 --> 17:33.780]  certain people and if they have the certain posts that will tell you, yes, this person is the type
[17:33.780 --> 17:39.860]  of person I want in my group who is, you know, is a nice person, maybe comments in a specific way.
[17:40.900 --> 17:45.700]  They have some interesting genetics, you follow similar people. And really the main way that you
[17:45.700 --> 17:51.860]  vet them is you allow them to come to a meeting and see what they're about. And when you come to,
[17:51.860 --> 17:57.140]  so maybe we'll back up about what our actual meetings are. So we meet and at our meetings,
[17:57.140 --> 18:02.180]  we have a specific topic that we may talk about very similar to like a podcast, like this podcast
[18:02.180 --> 18:06.980]  or something. So we would talk about a specific particular podcast, people would say what they
[18:06.980 --> 18:12.500]  agree or disagree about it. And then we would go on to another subject or, you know, riff on that
[18:12.500 --> 18:20.900]  one. And through that, you're able to get a kind of a feeling for what people are bringing to your
[18:20.900 --> 18:26.740]  group. Also, you know, people change and times change. And as you know, eventually some people
[18:26.740 --> 18:31.300]  aren't meant for the group. And you know, sometimes people leave themselves and sometimes people need
[18:31.300 --> 18:37.220]  to be asked to leave. And you know, I really feel like these groups are so important, or you know,
[18:37.220 --> 18:43.060]  this group is so important that you can't let that reality dissuade you from
[18:45.380 --> 18:51.540]  having a group. Because perhaps there are times when people have to be asked to leave, perhaps
[18:51.540 --> 18:59.380]  there are times when it's tough, but that's part of having a community. That's the most important
[18:59.380 --> 19:04.580]  aspect is that it's a community. And part of interacting with communities is setting certain
[19:04.580 --> 19:11.220]  goals and setting boundaries, and learning from those and you know, continuously adjusting yourself
[19:11.220 --> 19:16.740]  because that's what we do as people and as part of communities. And that's literally what this is.
[19:16.740 --> 19:17.860]  Sorry, guys, please jump in.
[19:19.300 --> 19:24.740]  No, you know, I mean, it's true about like, the vetting process. It's like, like you said,
[19:25.140 --> 19:30.100]  come together with people that are like minded, but absolutely vet, you know, I'll be the first
[19:30.100 --> 19:35.540]  one to say, there's a lot of scammers out there. There's a lot of people that are just looking to
[19:35.540 --> 19:43.540]  get free shit. And, you know, so you got to make sure that you're not, you're not kind of getting
[19:43.540 --> 19:48.020]  into these people that, you know, will get pissed off for whatever reason or not get your insta
[19:48.020 --> 19:54.180]  taken down, you know, fuck you off in other ways. I mean, it's kind of important because,
[19:54.180 --> 19:59.380]  you know, I mean, most of us grow because it's a passion. It's part of our lives. And it's our
[19:59.380 --> 20:04.100]  life, you know, for a lot of us, it's our livelihood. So, you know, it's kind of like,
[20:04.100 --> 20:10.180]  you don't want certain characters messing with that, you know, so I think it is important to vet
[20:12.740 --> 20:17.780]  you know, vet who you're bringing in because it is like, it's like you grow family, basically,
[20:18.340 --> 20:21.780]  you know, you guys are my grow family. So
[20:26.980 --> 20:33.700]  absolutely, you can pick your regular one, you can't, you know, so, but yeah, sometimes,
[20:33.700 --> 20:39.060]  you know, get out of hand and you know, you can't have one bad, you know, apple, you know,
[20:39.060 --> 20:46.500]  ruin the bunch anyways. So it is just keep it moving. And, you know, yeah, I think Peter just
[20:46.500 --> 20:51.700]  brought up IG is one of many ways. The best way to vet is to talk and give someone a chance.
[20:51.700 --> 20:59.460]  100%. And that's me. Oh, that's you? Okay, well, you're posting is IG. 100% though, like,
[21:00.100 --> 21:07.060]  it's all have off, you know, I'll have DM conversations with people to kind of see where
[21:07.060 --> 21:15.380]  they're at. If I see something that's similar that I like, or, you know, so I'll just start up a
[21:15.380 --> 21:21.140]  conversation, you know, and DMS about something that maybe we might have a mutual interest in.
[21:22.100 --> 21:27.380]  It could be something like, Oh, hey, I see that you grow a lot of stuff from one breeder. I you
[21:27.380 --> 21:32.660]  know, I love that breeder. I've grown some stuff from them. It's kind of a great way to start,
[21:33.380 --> 21:38.820]  just start a topic and start dialogue, really. Because I mean, that's all that this is. This
[21:38.900 --> 21:44.980]  is just dialogue between a bunch of people, you know, and, and so I think to go and vet is just
[21:45.700 --> 21:50.980]  find somebody that you're, you know, you share a common interest in, just start a dialogue with
[21:50.980 --> 21:57.300]  that person. See where they're at, you know, see if your personalities mesh, you know, I mean,
[21:57.300 --> 22:04.420]  that's, that's an important thing. So yeah, I guess that's my two cents on that.
[22:04.980 --> 22:12.820]  Yeah, I mean, vetting process is super important. You know, you just this is your community and you
[22:12.820 --> 22:20.260]  just dictate what you know, what you want that community to be. So yeah, moving on is mission.
[22:21.060 --> 22:26.980]  It's super, yeah, having a mission is crucial to these to these clubs, because everybody has
[22:27.860 --> 22:35.380]  their own take on what they want to do. And it's difficult to get anything done as a group if you
[22:35.380 --> 22:43.780]  don't have a shared mission. So the mission of the East Bay Seed Collective is to preserve
[22:43.780 --> 22:51.540]  landrace and heirloom genetics, and to preserve them in a seed library and to create a seed
[22:51.540 --> 23:00.980]  library of rare and important genetics. That's the mission of our of our seed group. Also,
[23:00.980 --> 23:07.060]  part of our mission is to trade seeds and to have picnics. So that's, that's the purpose of what we
[23:07.060 --> 23:15.060]  do. And everything that we do that is not those things is with that in mind to push that forward.
[23:15.060 --> 23:21.060]  And that's super important, because it's very easy for all different types of other things to
[23:21.060 --> 23:30.500]  come into your seed group. And that's not what you want. Participation, you guys want to jump
[23:30.500 --> 23:38.580]  in with that one? Absolutely crucial. I've been actually bad on that lately.
[23:40.100 --> 23:47.940]  So yeah, participation is crucial, especially like, if we're, you know, if there's a topic,
[23:48.500 --> 23:50.820]  um, you know, like a podcast.
[23:55.140 --> 24:01.940]  Why didn't it get picked again? Because Nick's awesome. That's why. So, I mean,
[24:03.620 --> 24:05.860]  I'm sorry, I gotta laugh this morning about that one.
[24:08.420 --> 24:15.540]  Shit. What are we talking about? Did not just joking. You know, I think participation is,
[24:15.540 --> 24:24.340]  is key. And especially if, you know, like we do, we have education. So, you know, we've all learned
[24:24.340 --> 24:31.300]  from the get go. I mean, we started out by going over Robert Clark's can of cannabis Bible,
[24:31.300 --> 24:38.820]  the can of Bible, um, you know, cannabis botany. And we, we went over that just so we could know
[24:38.820 --> 24:44.900]  the terms as a group, uh, brush up on things that we didn't know. But I think as far as recently,
[24:45.940 --> 24:51.780]  you know, there's curriculum, there's topics, and it's been good to participate, um, both
[24:52.820 --> 24:59.780]  off camera and on camera, um, that, you know, you do the work so you can participate. Um,
[25:00.740 --> 25:05.300]  you know, I mean, everybody will set their own collective up differently. We like to have an
[25:05.300 --> 25:11.140]  educational part to our collective. Um, so that's kind of what it's been from the forefront.
[25:11.700 --> 25:18.900]  And it's a huge, um, it's a huge driving force behind what we do. You know, we'll, uh,
[25:19.620 --> 25:26.180]  we'll basically first hour of a meeting that we have on zoom is going over what, you know,
[25:26.180 --> 25:33.780]  our take is on either podcast or a podcast and a reading what we took out of it. Any questions we
[25:33.860 --> 25:40.980]  may want to bounce off other members. Um, so we can get our take on it. Um, you know, if you,
[25:40.980 --> 25:46.580]  and if you're not participating off the camera, you're not really participating on the camera,
[25:47.540 --> 25:54.500]  you know? Um, so yeah, I think that's, it's, it's important to, if you're going to have any group
[25:55.460 --> 25:58.180]  show up, you know, I guess that's the best way to put it.
[25:58.500 --> 26:05.780]  I mean, I would, I would argue that like, um, so I've been, I guess, seriously breeding for,
[26:05.780 --> 26:13.220]  let's say about five years, but because of these meetings, I would argue that my level of
[26:13.220 --> 26:18.900]  understanding is quite, is more than that. I don't want to sound like cocky or anything like that,
[26:18.900 --> 26:24.820]  but like when you're able to regurgitate your same ideas and constantly challenge them and hear
[26:24.820 --> 26:30.740]  other people's ideas on a very, very regular basis, your level of understanding of things
[26:30.740 --> 26:38.340]  just skyrockets. But if the other people aren't pushing you, then you don't learn as much. And
[26:38.340 --> 26:44.660]  that's kind of the way that my honest thinking of when, you know, I want people in the group who
[26:44.660 --> 26:48.820]  know more than I do. I want to be the one who knows the least in the group so that I have to
[26:48.820 --> 26:53.780]  catch up to everybody else and everything that people are saying, you're just, you're just
[26:53.780 --> 26:59.460]  taking it in. And, you know, that's all about the participation. And like, you can't really
[27:00.020 --> 27:05.300]  discriminate against people who let's say, like, don't know as much as you,
[27:06.420 --> 27:12.100]  as long as they participate is the key. Because we have people in our group who are just getting
[27:12.100 --> 27:18.100]  started. But a lot of times, the questions that they ask are the right questions, or even us
[27:18.180 --> 27:25.380]  having to explain over again, the things that we assume that everybody should know. But the fact
[27:25.380 --> 27:30.580]  that we have to explain it over again, it makes it an even better thought in your own head.
[27:32.180 --> 27:37.140]  But you have to have people contributing. And because it's a collective, this isn't like a paid,
[27:37.140 --> 27:42.020]  this isn't like a class, where like one person is the teacher, and everybody else is a student,
[27:42.020 --> 27:46.420]  and they pay for this product. This is a collective where we all contribute. And
[27:46.980 --> 27:52.740]  as we all contribute, the more we contribute, the higher it goes. Where you know, all the
[27:52.740 --> 27:58.020]  metaphors apply, you know, the weakest link in the chain will break or, you know, like you want to be
[27:58.020 --> 28:04.180]  as good as you can. Like for me, I always think of it like, we want to be like, the best boy band,
[28:04.180 --> 28:11.460]  or like the best rap group, like Wu-Tang, or Backstreet Boys, or Bone Thugs, where like,
[28:12.020 --> 28:17.940]  everybody is raw. Every person has something that they bring to the table.
[28:18.900 --> 28:24.980]  And when you have that, you have these people talking around you consistently. You know,
[28:24.980 --> 28:30.820]  just that level of understanding is, I mean, you get a lot out of it. And you're also
[28:31.060 --> 28:37.460]  socializing at the same time. It was really kind of unique. I felt like, I don't know how long
[28:37.460 --> 28:43.620]  Future Cannabis Project has been around, but about a year into the club was when I started,
[28:43.620 --> 28:50.580]  when I, man, this is so similar to what we're doing, just like on a bigger scale, and, you know,
[28:51.300 --> 28:59.140]  on a different platform. So, you know, I was, it just drew me to it. Sorry.
[29:00.580 --> 29:02.660]  Now my flow is gone. The brain's moving.
[29:02.660 --> 29:08.340]  So, and one, I was thinking about this as you were riffing there is, one of the things that I
[29:09.300 --> 29:17.460]  love about the group, and especially, you know, our group is, y'all hold me accountable. And I
[29:17.460 --> 29:24.980]  think we hold each other accountable for things. You know, everybody got life going on. We all
[29:24.980 --> 29:30.900]  have projects. And I think just by keeping up with everybody and the progress that they're making in
[29:30.900 --> 29:37.140]  their own individual endeavors, kind of holds people accountable. And especially when we do
[29:37.140 --> 29:43.620]  things as a group project, like whether it's, you know, a multi-member seed increase, or we're,
[29:43.620 --> 29:52.180]  or we're specifically working on a project. I think that the interaction, you know, it, it makes
[29:52.180 --> 29:57.860]  you stay on a timeline. It holds you accountable for the things that you said you were going to do
[29:58.500 --> 30:06.180]  or that you want to do, you know, and I like that. So yeah, you know, the best thing is just seeing
[30:06.180 --> 30:12.100]  how other people are doing it a hundred percent, because, you know, you might see something that
[30:12.100 --> 30:17.940]  you're like, oh man, I've never tried that. You try it, it doesn't work. Or you try it and it works great.
[30:18.660 --> 30:27.780]  You know, I've learned a lot from members on here, especially about breeding, you know, not just
[30:27.780 --> 30:34.580]  growing, but more about breeding, because there's people on here that have, you know, a lot more
[30:34.580 --> 30:42.500]  experience than me and have a different take on things. So yeah, participation, participate,
[30:43.300 --> 30:49.540]  you know, you know, definitely, and, and come correct when you're going to come to the meetings,
[30:49.540 --> 30:57.460]  you know. I mean, I grow fire, but I don't grow the best fire, you know, so you might learn
[30:57.460 --> 31:02.500]  something from someone else one of these days, you know, because there's certainly, you know,
[31:03.220 --> 31:10.420]  different people in our group that have different skill levels that still ask the right questions.
[31:10.420 --> 31:16.900]  It's like, there's no stupid question. There's only stupid answers, you know. And I mean, for
[31:16.900 --> 31:22.660]  instance, we have a newer member, you know, who's asking about something this morning on our thread.
[31:23.460 --> 31:30.180]  And it was actually a really good question. And it's a topic that, that Indiva and I have been
[31:30.180 --> 31:37.060]  talking about for a couple months now. It's an experiment. I just put cuts in a jar in my fridge,
[31:37.060 --> 31:43.940]  nothing special, nothing in the water, no nutrients, and we're on nine weeks. So that's like,
[31:44.580 --> 31:51.220]  a cool thing that we can do by communicating little things, little topics we brought up
[31:51.220 --> 31:55.780]  in the past. It's like, Oh, well, I'm gonna do that and show everybody that it can be done.
[31:56.500 --> 32:04.660]  Um, so that's, that's just the inner communication of a group. I'm sorry, I could ramble on. I smoked
[32:04.660 --> 32:10.980]  some Tahoe wedding this morning that's kicking my ass. But at least I'm not as high as last week
[32:10.980 --> 32:19.620]  when I smoked the PK. So what else you want? Indiva, you got anything to riff on that or?
[32:19.620 --> 32:28.660]  I don't know. I was waiting my turn and then I forgot.
[32:34.820 --> 32:38.180]  Um, I will the next come back to me.
[32:39.300 --> 32:42.980]  Um, one that I didn't put in here, but I just want to start at the starting now.
[32:43.540 --> 32:45.540]  Don't have your club be a seed company.
[32:48.500 --> 32:56.020]  That's the best way to have your organization. Don't have it be something where you are selling
[32:56.580 --> 33:04.260]  things to other people. Just don't. The club is a non-profit. You are there to learn,
[33:04.260 --> 33:11.780]  you are there to geek out and trade seeds. As soon as you bring money involved in selling things and
[33:12.660 --> 33:17.780]  splitting profits and all of that is the ultimate way to end your organization. So just don't do
[33:17.780 --> 33:23.540]  that. Um, I feel like that's one of the main reasons that we have been successful is that
[33:24.260 --> 33:31.540]  our currency is seed trading and geeking out. I mean, that's it. You know, we don't sell seeds
[33:31.540 --> 33:35.460]  as a group. So that's the most important thing. If you want to sell seeds separately,
[33:35.780 --> 33:42.100]  you know, do whatever you need to do, but don't do that as part of your group.
[33:42.100 --> 33:46.980]  Our group's purpose is to learn and to trade genetics. And that's super important.
[33:46.980 --> 33:56.100]  That's a very important aspect of the group to keep in mind. Um, the next thing on my list was
[33:56.100 --> 34:02.420]  meetups. It's really awesome to meet up with the people in person. We like to, you know,
[34:02.420 --> 34:06.420]  if you can do your meetings in person, that's great. But if not, you can do your meetings
[34:06.420 --> 34:12.500]  always over like some like zoom or whatever, but it's important to have meetups meet in person,
[34:13.300 --> 34:18.900]  have smoke outs, have harvest parties. We try to do at least two harvest parties a year
[34:20.260 --> 34:27.300]  in our harvest parties. We trade seeds, we trade buds, we barbecue, we drink beers.
[34:28.020 --> 34:34.500]  It's a really good time. Yeah. And we let other friends and families, especially for the barbecues.
[34:35.860 --> 34:42.580]  Those have been open to not just collective members, but to other people within the industry,
[34:43.300 --> 34:48.420]  local and abroad. You know, if they're in the area, you know, it's like, you know,
[34:48.420 --> 34:53.940]  we'd love to have other breeders and stuff that come down there, hang out with us. But yeah,
[34:53.940 --> 35:01.300]  I think meeting rather in person or something, doing something like online, like zoom, like we
[35:01.300 --> 35:08.180]  do, or, you know, jumping on for a discord or something like that. And just having like maybe
[35:08.980 --> 35:14.500]  two hours a month or every other week where you just kind of get together and riff on a subject,
[35:14.500 --> 35:21.780]  like a topic, or, you know, that may not be what your group is about, but at least you just
[35:21.780 --> 35:27.540]  check up on each other, you know, just see how everybody's doing, you know, and especially if you
[35:27.540 --> 35:33.300]  aren't able to meet in person, I think that's crucial. You know, just check up on your fellow
[35:33.300 --> 35:39.140]  grommies, see how everybody's doing. You know, it's not an easy time. It's not an easy time in
[35:39.140 --> 35:46.820]  cannabis. It's not easy time in society right now. There's a lot of shit going on, you know, so
[35:47.620 --> 35:52.820]  everybody takes things differently. Check up on people, see how you're doing. I know I appreciate
[35:52.820 --> 35:58.420]  it when, when you know, I haven't been as active or something, you know, and I got members, you
[35:58.420 --> 36:04.420]  know, sending me DMS, calling texting, hey, man, how are you doing? Are you doing all right? I really
[36:04.420 --> 36:11.380]  appreciate that. You know, it makes it more than just about the group about it. It's like, we
[36:11.380 --> 36:15.940]  actually care about each other. You know, not to say that everybody's going to care about each other.
[36:15.940 --> 36:21.060]  You know, this isn't, we're not promoting, you know, Kumbaya or anything like that. I'm not
[36:21.060 --> 36:26.740]  saying we're going to bust out guitars and sing, but just check up on your grommies. You respect
[36:26.740 --> 36:36.420]  these. That's the other thing that's the key to any group respect. Like I can't emphasize that
[36:36.420 --> 36:42.580]  anymore. Moving forward is just, just respect people. We all have different thoughts,
[36:43.140 --> 36:48.420]  different ways of life, different viewpoints, but at least we respect each other that we can
[36:48.420 --> 36:53.620]  come together on a current topic. Like I can tell you right now, we all have very different
[36:53.620 --> 36:58.900]  political viewpoints. We don't talk about that shit at meeting. That's like never even come up.
[37:00.580 --> 37:08.340]  You know, so just keep it respectful, communicate. And, you know, yeah. And just
[37:09.300 --> 37:13.220]  share knowledge with people, you know, like that's the thing. If you have,
[37:13.220 --> 37:18.420]  if you have a proprietary thing that you, you think you are the only one that does,
[37:19.060 --> 37:23.620]  I bet you you're not. And there's someone else that does what you do. So communicate,
[37:24.180 --> 37:30.980]  you know? Yeah. I mean, I could go off on a whole tangent, but I think that would get sidetracked
[37:30.980 --> 37:37.940]  about the negatives about certain aspects of, of things, but let's just keep it positive for
[37:38.100 --> 37:49.220]  right now. Yeah. I mean, get together, meet up whether online or in person, that's the best way,
[37:49.220 --> 37:58.980]  you know? Like, you know, I mean, Indiva, we live in the Bay Area, Indiva lives in a completely
[37:58.980 --> 38:05.700]  other state. Always there, always on point, been to party events, every meeting, never missed a
[38:05.700 --> 38:13.060]  meeting. And, you know, we love the dude. He brings, he brings a different thing to the table
[38:13.060 --> 38:19.700]  than all of us do. And we respect that. You know, so, so that's the thing is like, you know,
[38:19.700 --> 38:25.780]  we got people in other states. In fact, we've got people from San Francisco to Maine, you know,
[38:25.780 --> 38:33.380]  that are part of this group. And so obviously, you know, through live, you know, live feeds,
[38:33.380 --> 38:37.220]  it's really the only way we can keep up and communicate to figure out what each of us are
[38:37.220 --> 38:45.220]  doing. And to stay on projects, if some of us are working on projects together. So yeah, that's my
[38:45.220 --> 38:55.220]  take on meetings. Awesome. We're having Grasshopper join us. Yeah. Another, another member, he's,
[38:55.220 --> 39:05.860]  he's joining audio only. Good morning, everyone. Good morning. Good morning. So just to let you
[39:05.860 --> 39:11.540]  know, Grasshopper, what we're doing right now is we're just going over like the top important
[39:11.540 --> 39:18.820]  things when it comes to starting a seed collective or starting a collective. And we're just, you know,
[39:18.820 --> 39:25.060]  kind of encouraging people to start their own type of organization. And just, you know, the things
[39:25.060 --> 39:34.900]  that would be helpful for them. So I guess the next thing is projects. So after meetups is projects,
[39:34.900 --> 39:42.340]  I think having, you know, a common goal for your seed club is super important because people will
[39:42.340 --> 39:48.980]  be like, well, what's the point? What are we doing here? And so for us, the goal is to create a
[39:48.980 --> 39:55.700]  library of land, race, and heirloom genetics, as well as other hybrids that are, you know,
[39:55.700 --> 40:02.260]  we deem important and, you know, that need to be saved. So that is the goal of our group.
[40:03.620 --> 40:12.820]  The other goal of our group is to have picnics and meetups, trade seeds. So that's super important
[40:12.820 --> 40:20.740]  that you have a mission and that your projects back up that mission. You have some sort of
[40:20.740 --> 40:30.020]  action plan for all the talking because people want to take action towards a common goal and
[40:30.020 --> 40:38.100]  not just talk about things forever. I was gonna talk about we doing like history
[40:38.820 --> 40:45.060]  stuff and then, well, like not speaking specifically on it, just us doing
[40:46.580 --> 40:51.940]  different presentations on history and then different members doing presentations on
[40:52.900 --> 40:58.820]  stuff they're fluent in, just because, you know, there's so much to learn here and everybody can
[40:58.820 --> 41:05.140]  bring different things to the table. And, you know, that's just what's great about, you know,
[41:05.220 --> 41:11.060]  this type of stuff. So that's what I was just gonna get at anyways. So.
[41:11.060 --> 41:16.790]  Let me stop stuffing my face full of donut here.
[41:19.590 --> 41:27.110]  Yeah, no, the projects are important, especially with what we're doing with like
[41:27.750 --> 41:36.150]  either a land race or as we like to call it heritage or heirloom, which may be not land race,
[41:36.150 --> 41:44.790]  has an important part of the cannabis scene. Like I know, for instance, a few years back,
[41:46.230 --> 41:54.470]  Jamal and I did an open pollination to preserve a gooey breeders pure gooey, the NorCal gooey.
[41:55.430 --> 42:03.030]  That was one year. I know in years past, we've worked with other land races such as
[42:03.750 --> 42:09.590]  Wailing Valley. Yeah, the Wailing Valley. We ran a bunch of different Panama Reds from different
[42:09.590 --> 42:15.110]  producers, which is kind of funny. I would not call Panama Red a land race. I think it's been
[42:15.110 --> 42:21.990]  an heirloom. Everybody's was different. Can't really say who's the real one, but as a group,
[42:21.990 --> 42:32.710]  we could see that that was one of our projects. I know this year, Jamal and Grasshopper are working
[42:32.710 --> 42:39.670]  with some of the grasshoppers, heirloom, heritage, strain, the Hanalei, which some people
[42:39.670 --> 42:49.430]  on here might be aware of. It's to preserve these sorts of things in the future. So like
[42:50.310 --> 42:56.070]  these projects are kind of the core thing of what this group was brought together for.
[42:56.710 --> 43:03.510]  So we kind of keep on that and make sure that we do at least one
[43:05.350 --> 43:14.070]  collective collaboration or project a year. I'd like to do more, but we're kind of doing some
[43:14.070 --> 43:19.830]  structured stuff right now. But that's important. It puts us all on the same page and it gets us
[43:19.830 --> 43:28.550]  to work together as a group. So, yeah, that's an important part of what we do. I mean, there's
[43:29.110 --> 43:35.350]  other been from what I understand in cannabis history, there's been projects that were a huge
[43:35.350 --> 43:42.310]  part of what we see today. From what I understand about the OGKB, that was an ICMAG project,
[43:43.030 --> 43:48.710]  where multiple people kind of brought different things to the table over a period of time through
[43:48.710 --> 43:53.750]  one of the forums, which is kind of like what we're doing as a much smaller group and more
[43:53.750 --> 44:06.710]  privatized. But yeah, I mean, it's an important part of what we do. And it's integral to keeping
[44:07.270 --> 44:15.510]  what eSpace Seed Collective was founded on, the principles, alive and going. Sorry, was that enough?
[44:15.590 --> 44:21.750]  Yeah. And Grasshopper, you're welcome to jump in too, if you have any input regarding
[44:22.710 --> 44:26.630]  what we're talking about, which are projects for the Seed Club.
[44:28.310 --> 44:30.550]  I think everybody's doing Malawi stuff.
[44:30.550 --> 44:31.050]  Okay.
[44:34.550 --> 44:44.310]  There's a lot of seed in Malawi. I got some Malawi. Kamal, don't you have some? I think
[44:45.270 --> 44:47.670]  the Grasshopper, you have some Malawi too, don't you?
[44:51.270 --> 44:58.310]  I haven't really had great experiences with the Malawi in the past, but I'm looking forward to
[44:58.310 --> 45:05.990]  working with them again in the future. But as far as the collective goes, yeah, I'm happy to be a
[45:05.990 --> 45:14.150]  member. It's a lot of like-minded people, a lot of people that have the same goals. And
[45:16.710 --> 45:23.910]  I'm happy to be a part of it. And these guys have a lot to share. And I've learned a lot from them
[45:23.910 --> 45:31.750]  over the past year or so. And I would encourage everybody to have community. Likewise, it's great
[45:31.750 --> 45:40.710]  to have community. It's really helpful with exactly what we're trying to accomplish here as
[45:40.710 --> 45:48.070]  far as preservations. Because sometimes there's so many things. For instance, I have a bunch of
[45:48.070 --> 45:55.270]  other things that I probably was never going to get to. But it's great to have assistance from
[45:55.270 --> 45:58.710]  other people who have been to preserve and stuff. Yeah.
[46:01.750 --> 46:08.710]  Awesome. Yeah. And I would just reiterate, it's amazing to have different kinds of people in the
[46:08.710 --> 46:20.550]  group. Like, for example, Grasshopper has so much information and such a, just has so much
[46:20.550 --> 46:27.590]  information. And it's different from Huey's information. It's different from Nick's information.
[46:27.590 --> 46:33.430]  It's different from mine. And so when we all share and just put our kind of take on it,
[46:33.990 --> 46:39.670]  you just get such a well-rounded take on these subjects. And it's definitely not like we know
[46:39.670 --> 46:45.670]  everything. No, we don't at all. But we just get so many different, really solid perspectives
[46:45.670 --> 46:52.470]  on these things. It's nice to then follow up and you really are able to learn a lot in these past
[46:52.470 --> 47:00.230]  years. You know, I feel like the first year of the club was almost like teaching everybody. Everybody
[47:00.230 --> 47:04.550]  had to learn how to breed. Or not everybody, many people in the group had to learn how to breed. But
[47:04.550 --> 47:11.750]  then once the skill level got to a certain level, then it was just, it just started moving really,
[47:11.750 --> 47:15.750]  really fast at that point. So like, it's kind of like the momentum. Like at first,
[47:16.630 --> 47:21.750]  it's slow to get it started. But then once you get the momentum going and you get the,
[47:21.750 --> 47:28.230]  you know, high enough skill level, you have people who know the nomenclature, the vocabulary for
[47:28.230 --> 47:33.750]  the, you know, for breeding, then we really started getting momentum and started moving forward.
[47:34.390 --> 47:42.630]  So seed bank. This is, you know, something that we're learning right now. It's a difficult topic,
[47:42.630 --> 47:46.550]  but I would encourage you to have a seed bank. If you start a seed collective,
[47:47.510 --> 47:56.310]  have a bank where you donate seeds as a group. You can have them to grow in the future. You know,
[47:56.310 --> 48:02.870]  like, it's not an easy subject. Like, you know, when people are donating their seeds, you have
[48:02.950 --> 48:09.270]  to go into, you know, what are the requirements to take seeds out? You know, what can these seeds
[48:09.270 --> 48:16.150]  be used for? And I don't have answers for like the best way to do it. Because we're still learning,
[48:16.950 --> 48:22.470]  but it's worth having the conversation to have those seeds. Because imagine if
[48:24.390 --> 48:29.910]  this seed collective 10 years ago. Imagine if we had this seed collective 20 years ago.
[48:30.550 --> 48:35.350]  And all those genetics that we, you know, theoretically could have had in those in there.
[48:35.910 --> 48:38.390]  It would all be amazing stuff that we would love to have now.
[48:39.430 --> 48:44.790]  So, you know, it's no different now from 10 years from now, you know, in the future.
[48:47.270 --> 48:52.790]  Yeah, no, I'd really pick some stuff that was 10, 20 years ago. That's, I mean,
[48:53.510 --> 48:57.750]  that's like the golden age, you know, so that'd be incredible.
[49:00.230 --> 49:07.830]  Yeah, no, I agree with the seed bank being important. Especially if you're a group
[49:07.830 --> 49:14.150]  that works well together. And people work in different wheelhouses, like,
[49:15.030 --> 49:21.030]  you know, you grow for small plants, you grow for terpenes. You know, you're growing for
[49:21.750 --> 49:29.830]  outdoor durability. It's interesting to have these things vaulted for other members to use,
[49:29.830 --> 49:37.670]  like, you know, like when we did the pure gooey increase, Jamal and I found that the pineapple
[49:37.670 --> 49:45.910]  pheno out of that thing. And then we immediately vaulted it in case any members wanted to use that
[49:45.910 --> 49:53.190]  down the road. You know, if you for a project, it's in there. Jamal has put some of his strains
[49:53.190 --> 50:01.590]  that he's made in the past in the vault. I'm pretty sure I put a few things in there.
[50:01.590 --> 50:07.190]  And they're more breeding stock, you know, for people like, like, you know, I know, like grasshopper
[50:07.190 --> 50:13.430]  and I, I know we're gonna get clowned for it. We love those tangy turps. They're never gonna go
[50:13.430 --> 50:21.270]  away. So, you know, I, I got a strain that breeds pretty true to the orange, you know, and it's like,
[50:21.270 --> 50:26.390]  it's just something we're gonna keep around. I would throw that in the seed bank. Because
[50:26.390 --> 50:31.590]  if somebody wants to work on a project, they're like, Oh, I'd love to add some orange turps,
[50:31.590 --> 50:37.430]  or something to it, they can just go pull out of the vault and work with it. You know, that's the
[50:37.430 --> 50:45.270]  point of like, the seed bank is preserving the work. And not just for me, you know, I, you know,
[50:45.270 --> 50:51.270]  something I made it so that other people can you do it, you know, first and foremost, we're not
[50:51.270 --> 50:57.910]  just making seeds for ourselves. You know, I mean, we want them, we want other people to grow them.
[50:58.550 --> 51:05.110]  So that's kind of the point of having a seed bank for collective members is that people can put
[51:05.110 --> 51:16.630]  things in there for current members to work with, use within their realm house, or stuff that,
[51:16.630 --> 51:25.750]  you know, might interest newer members down the road that weren't part of that. So, so yeah,
[51:25.750 --> 51:31.910]  the seed bank, I think is a big, is a big thing. But also, you know, unless you're making everything
[51:31.910 --> 51:39.270]  yourself, it can be costly. You know, I know, there have been members in the club where, you
[51:39.270 --> 51:45.990]  know, we've dropped, you know, a few hundred dollars on on seed packs. So because we were
[51:45.990 --> 51:56.070]  collectively looking for things. So that there is cost involved in that sort of thing. But then that
[51:56.070 --> 52:01.590]  goes back to communication and working things out. And the get go and dues, you know, it can go
[52:01.590 --> 52:10.630]  like our dues will eventually go to collective projects where it might be like an heirloom
[52:10.630 --> 52:17.590]  seed increase or land raise seed increase, which would go back into the bank, then for people to
[52:17.590 --> 52:26.630]  use whenever. So, yeah, and as we recently talked about, it might be good to have two banks at two
[52:26.630 --> 52:33.430]  different locations. Just in case, you know, life happens, some happens, you know, you still got
[52:33.430 --> 52:38.070]  everything backed up. And I think that's, that's also the point of the bank is to back your shit
[52:38.070 --> 52:46.390]  up. Someone else can, can you have your stuff to back it up. And it's a way for members to share
[52:46.390 --> 52:54.910]  past and present work with each other. Yeah, I was also gonna say having another section
[52:55.630 --> 53:01.150]  to put in the freezer too, even if you want to keep something for, you know, for preservation
[53:01.150 --> 53:08.590]  purposes, actually, in the freezer is going to be the best way to go. And then if you have like
[53:08.590 --> 53:15.870]  rare and old seeds, or you only have just a few of them, tissue culture is probably the best way to
[53:15.870 --> 53:22.190]  go. But you got to do your research on it. I mean, I wouldn't use those seeds the first time
[53:22.190 --> 53:27.790]  you'd go do try and tissue culture for it, you know, for, you know, just to make, make sure
[53:28.510 --> 53:40.890]  you don't fuck anything up and ruin your seed. So yeah. Jamal, you got anything to add on that?
[53:41.850 --> 53:46.330]  No, no, I was, you know, just trying to let everybody, you know, get a full opportunity.
[53:47.130 --> 53:54.410]  Um, yeah, I guess the last thing is outreach. You know, you always want to keep your club growing,
[53:55.530 --> 53:59.210]  less you feel like you have too many members, but you know, you always want to keep it growing.
[54:01.130 --> 54:08.570]  It's really good to outreach, reach out to people, to the right people. And, you know, to let people
[54:08.570 --> 54:14.330]  in the community know what you're doing. You want to be selective of what the community is that you
[54:14.330 --> 54:20.570]  want to let know what you're doing. But, you know, as long as you really keep this based in legality,
[54:21.850 --> 54:27.130]  that makes it a lot easier. And, you know, I just really want to stress that like,
[54:28.090 --> 54:38.090]  talking about cannabis, trading seeds is legal. And if you're in a, you know, I mean, I wouldn't
[54:38.090 --> 54:42.570]  recommend doing this in like a state that doesn't have medical, but if you're in a state that has
[54:42.570 --> 54:48.010]  medical, you're a state that's legal, you know, follow within the laws what you're doing. And
[54:48.010 --> 54:54.730]  when you do that, it kind of allows you to be a little bit less concerned about exactly what's
[54:54.730 --> 55:01.210]  going on. Because, you know, it is legal. And I mean, you know, people outside of this do whatever
[55:01.210 --> 55:05.610]  they're going to do. And that's none of our business or our concern. I mean, you do whatever.
[55:05.610 --> 55:12.170]  But this, this is not us growing weed and selling it together. That's not what this is.
[55:12.970 --> 55:19.050]  And it's important that your club is not that. This is us geeking out and getting information
[55:19.610 --> 55:22.490]  that you can then take the information and do whatever you need to do.
[55:23.130 --> 55:29.050]  The information is the hard part, not growing the weed. That's easy. But this is the hard part,
[55:29.050 --> 55:34.330]  is learning how to do it so that it's fire. And that's what we're doing, is learning how to make
[55:34.410 --> 55:41.450]  good seeds, learning how to grow the right fire and asking the questions, not being afraid to ask
[55:41.450 --> 55:48.730]  stupid questions to have a place where we can learn and have this be a community where we actually
[55:50.010 --> 55:55.370]  give a shit about each other. And that's also important that we care about each other,
[55:55.370 --> 56:01.610]  that we check in on each other and that, you know, we're friends. That's part of it. And that's
[56:01.610 --> 56:07.130]  important because you need that in your life, not just to sit at home all day and smoke weed.
[56:08.970 --> 56:09.610]  Absolutely.
[56:10.890 --> 56:15.930]  You know, for everybody. And, you know, like for me as the head of the group, part of my goal
[56:16.570 --> 56:21.930]  is to encourage the other people to take leadership roles as well. And that's important
[56:21.930 --> 56:26.330]  for me to learn that. And that's important for them to learn that. And that's kind of,
[56:26.330 --> 56:33.770]  you know, the give and take of these types of collectives. So, yeah, you know, like if people
[56:33.770 --> 56:39.850]  are interested, you know, you can reach out to me. I'm willing to help you out and how to form one.
[56:40.890 --> 56:45.370]  You know, there's lots of other stuff to get into. Like, we're going to leave it at that. But like,
[56:45.370 --> 56:51.770]  getting into like the content, you know, exactly what you choose to talk about is super important.
[56:52.010 --> 56:52.570]  Absolutely.
[56:54.010 --> 57:00.410]  Correct. Let's dive into that one. The content is super important. What you talk about
[57:01.290 --> 57:08.090]  drive the whole value of all of it. Because if you are talking about something that nobody cares
[57:08.090 --> 57:13.450]  about, then that's not a good topic. If you have a topic that drives, let's say,
[57:13.450 --> 57:19.610]  hour long conversation, you know, that is a good topic. And that is what people are getting out of
[57:19.690 --> 57:26.410]  it. That is the purpose. That's the action. That's like the juice of these organizations
[57:26.410 --> 57:34.090]  is the topic and the conversation. That's very important. So, I think Nick is the main,
[57:34.090 --> 57:38.730]  and Viva is the main person right now who's helping me, me and him, or he is the one running that.
[57:39.370 --> 57:44.570]  Historically, I've been the one that has been running that. And finding good topics,
[57:45.210 --> 57:50.890]  and finding good topics, finding good podcasts, there's always good stuff on Future Cannabis
[57:50.890 --> 57:58.250]  Project. There's always good stuff on the podcast. Great, great, great show. Matt Riott's show.
[57:58.890 --> 58:05.850]  Great, great, great show. I mean, the three of those, we probably get 90% of our information.
[58:05.850 --> 58:14.570]  Future Cannabis Project, Breeders Syndicate, and the podcast. And besides learning from listening
[58:14.570 --> 58:21.370]  when you have the other members regurgitating that material back, you're able to learn this material
[58:21.370 --> 58:29.930]  at a really fast rate. And the conversations are so engaging and intellectually stimulating that
[58:30.490 --> 58:37.050]  personally, I have left some of the meetings feeling very good and energized from the
[58:37.050 --> 58:45.850]  conversation. What did you guys take on that? I'd say content is huge, but the right type of
[58:45.850 --> 58:56.490]  content. Not doing stuff that's actually truth and not bro science, and you're wasting time on
[58:56.570 --> 59:04.330]  stuff that's just a waste of time, more or less. That's not proven scientific research data.
[59:05.370 --> 59:12.890]  I mean, that's just it. Because you can spend years, I don't mean to offend a form or anything.
[59:12.890 --> 59:18.330]  They were great at their time, but there's a lot of bro science on them. And you have to be careful
[59:18.330 --> 59:25.610]  on what you're reading, on what's truth and what's bro science, more or less. There's a lot of that
[59:25.610 --> 59:31.850]  out there. And if you're a new grower, there's just so much data and stuff to learn. It's hard to
[59:32.570 --> 59:39.210]  know what's real and what's not. The thing with it is finding the correct information
[59:39.210 --> 59:43.050]  and spending your time on stuff that's worth spending your time on.
[59:45.450 --> 59:50.890]  Well, I know there's been a couple of meetings where Grasshoppers brought up a topic that just
[59:50.890 --> 59:59.690]  sent me down the rabbit hole of like, oh, shit. I never thought about that. And so control
[01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:09.770]  plants. I'm still on the deep dive, swirling about that. At first I was like, huh? And then
[01:00:09.770 --> 01:00:18.970]  all of a sudden I was like, oh, it makes perfect sense. So yeah. I mean, everybody brings something
[01:00:19.050 --> 01:00:25.450]  different to the table. And, you know, I mean, there have been like, like Jamal said, there've
[01:00:25.450 --> 01:00:31.450]  been some meetings where we've come away like, I've learned so much. And it's funny because it's
[01:00:31.450 --> 01:00:37.690]  it's usually the stuff that's off topic where we're just riffing. You know, just somebody will
[01:00:37.690 --> 01:00:44.970]  strike up something and we'll just go hard on that subject, you know, and, and sometimes those are
[01:00:44.970 --> 01:00:50.170]  like, the most insightful when you know, it's like, almost towards the end and someone will
[01:00:50.170 --> 01:00:55.850]  bring up the topic and then boom, it's like, it's like a light goes off and you're and you could
[01:00:55.850 --> 01:01:02.890]  just see it in the people's faces on the zoom meeting. It's like, oh, shit. You know, um,
[01:01:04.170 --> 01:01:09.370]  dude, that's why I love this. This group is you know, like we, everybody brings something
[01:01:09.370 --> 01:01:14.330]  different to the table. We all learn from, from each other. Like, you know, um,
[01:01:15.450 --> 01:01:21.050]  yeah, absolutely. That's I agree. That's what's great about the group is everybody brings
[01:01:21.050 --> 01:01:25.770]  something different to it. And everybody's great at their own little niche of things. So, you know,
[01:01:25.770 --> 01:01:32.730]  you can always learn from everybody and improve your game as a whole, you know, just from everybody
[01:01:32.730 --> 01:01:36.650]  to, you know, which is wonderful. And then everybody, you know, gets to learn and improve
[01:01:36.650 --> 01:01:40.650]  their game at the same time. You know, it's a win win for everybody. You know, it's not like
[01:01:40.650 --> 01:01:46.330]  you're gonna win. I'm, you know, having one of these or anything, you know, I mean, if you're,
[01:01:46.330 --> 01:01:52.330]  you're not dedicated to it, it might be for you. But I mean, if if cannabis is your thing, and
[01:01:52.330 --> 01:01:56.570]  more of a lifestyle to you, you know, it's, it's, it's great and wonderful.
[01:01:57.290 --> 01:02:06.170]  Yeah. Well, I mean, you did a you did a, a, you know, a thing on storing pollen in the get go,
[01:02:06.170 --> 01:02:12.170]  one of the first ones and you know, I think a few of us learned. I learned that you and I are
[01:02:12.170 --> 01:02:18.490]  very similar. But then I was like, Oh, I could do it a little different, which might be it. Jamal
[01:02:18.490 --> 01:02:25.610]  did a thing on microbreeding. You know, like, um, yeah, we all bring different things to the table.
[01:02:25.610 --> 01:02:30.250]  We all learn from each other. And that that's, yeah.
[01:02:30.570 --> 01:02:32.570]  We love seeds also.
[01:02:32.570 --> 01:02:34.090]  Yeah, we love seeds.
[01:02:34.090 --> 01:02:35.530]  Probably a little too much.
[01:02:41.370 --> 01:02:48.490]  So yeah, I think that's that kind of sums that feel like that kind of rounds, rounds it out.
[01:02:49.370 --> 01:02:53.530]  I mean, there's so many things we could talk about regarding collectives. I mean,
[01:02:53.610 --> 01:03:00.170]  collectives. I mean, if you recall, like, 215, which is one of the first legal cannabis laws,
[01:03:01.050 --> 01:03:07.770]  has a bunch of provisions regarding collectives. So like back in the medical days, like you would
[01:03:07.770 --> 01:03:12.490]  always like, Oh, let me get your card, let me get your card to your friends who have medical cards,
[01:03:12.490 --> 01:03:20.490]  because that would allow you to grow more plants. So, you know, cannabis collectives and collectivizing
[01:03:20.490 --> 01:03:25.850]  these things, it's, you know, this is not unique to us, what we're doing. I mean,
[01:03:25.850 --> 01:03:30.330]  this is just like how it's traditionally done. I mean, this is, you know, this is just one of
[01:03:30.330 --> 01:03:37.610]  many ways to do it. So yeah, I was thinking the next thing we were going to do is, you know,
[01:03:37.610 --> 01:03:42.890]  we had Grasshopper come on, and he was going to talk about some really cool gear, because he has
[01:03:42.890 --> 01:03:51.210]  just a bunch of neat gear from all around the world that, you know, I've grown a lot of it.
[01:03:51.930 --> 01:03:59.770]  And I mean, it's totally worth people checking out. And, you know, it's always really interesting
[01:03:59.770 --> 01:04:06.250]  to hear these stories. So Grasshopper, we'd love to hear what you're working on these days.
[01:04:06.330 --> 01:04:15.970]  Yeah. Hey Jamal, thanks. I don't have a whole lot working on at the moment. I mean,
[01:04:16.930 --> 01:04:25.250]  trying to do some preservation and a few back crosses. Right now I got an Urco back cross going,
[01:04:25.250 --> 01:04:33.330]  and about to do a cherry pie back cross, and then trying to reverse a Florida OG, and
[01:04:34.050 --> 01:04:42.370]  stuff like that. But as far as land races and heirlooms, I'm doing a preservation of the Gobi
[01:04:42.370 --> 01:04:50.930]  again. This is straight from 1987 or something like that. So I'm just getting low on the seed
[01:04:50.930 --> 01:04:55.410]  stock. They're getting old, so I'm kind of, you know, doing a selection and a repopulation of
[01:04:55.810 --> 01:05:06.130]  those. Yeah, not a whole lot as far as, you know.
[01:05:06.130 --> 01:05:08.530]  You said you were at Senegalese.
[01:05:09.410 --> 01:05:20.290]  Man, I got some Senegalese, some Swazi, and some strain from some Central Mexican
[01:05:21.090 --> 01:05:27.570]  that I've been trying to get at for a long time. And this is kind of one of the reasons I
[01:05:29.570 --> 01:05:36.450]  kind of jump on the group as well, and to try to be a part of the collective. Yeah,
[01:05:36.450 --> 01:05:41.090]  that's just kind of like get a hand with some of the work, because there's so much things.
[01:05:42.450 --> 01:05:47.090]  It's like you go into a midlife crisis when you're looking at stuff sitting. Man, it's been
[01:05:47.090 --> 01:05:54.770]  seven years on that one. I got to repopulate them. I got to refresh those. And then time goes
[01:05:54.770 --> 01:05:59.090]  by, and time goes by, and so much stuff to work on, and so much stuff on the burner.
[01:05:59.810 --> 01:06:04.290]  So I haven't really had a chance to look at the Senegalese. I pulled out about 40 of them
[01:06:05.250 --> 01:06:12.290]  with the intentions to put them down. I haven't got a chance to do it yet. And I also got some
[01:06:12.290 --> 01:06:18.930]  Swazi directly from the source that I'm intended on working on as well. But, you know, busy with
[01:06:18.930 --> 01:06:24.690]  the children and work, and trying to make sure everybody's okay. It's been kind of challenging.
[01:06:25.490 --> 01:06:31.490]  So that's one of the reasons I've been extending some of these projects to you guys, whoever might
[01:06:31.490 --> 01:06:37.730]  want to take some on and stuff like that. But they should be pretty unique. They're
[01:06:38.370 --> 01:06:43.250]  nothing like what's available on the market, because they're, you know, collected directly
[01:06:43.250 --> 01:06:48.690]  from the source and stuff like that. So looking forward to opening them and seeing what's in them.
[01:06:48.690 --> 01:06:54.930]  I mean, most of the stuff that I work on is directly from the source. The Hanalei is directly
[01:06:54.930 --> 01:07:02.130]  from the source. I just had a chance after 10 years to repopulate those, and those are the ones
[01:07:02.130 --> 01:07:15.170]  that you guys are working with now. So, you know, it's just been challenging. So many of them.
[01:07:16.770 --> 01:07:23.650]  I love our hands sometimes. But yeah, that's what I'm working on. I'm really, right now,
[01:07:23.650 --> 01:07:29.890]  I'm doing mostly some tarp type breeding this summer, as opposed to going into the land races
[01:07:29.890 --> 01:07:35.330]  and the heirlooms and stuff. But, you know, just doing preservation at least two a year. I got so
[01:07:35.330 --> 01:07:40.130]  much old land races that I pulled them out and try to refresh at least two a year. After like seven
[01:07:40.130 --> 01:07:45.650]  years go by, five, six, seven years, I'm like, okay, time to refresh that one. Try to pull them
[01:07:45.650 --> 01:07:50.850]  out, pop a few dozen seeds, make a selection and go from there again and put them back in the fridge.
[01:07:51.170 --> 01:07:53.890]  Let's talk about the purple unicorn hybrids.
[01:07:54.850 --> 01:08:03.730]  Oh yeah. Well, the Urkel is a cut I got probably about 20 years ago, 19 years to be more exact.
[01:08:05.890 --> 01:08:08.210]  No, I was saying the purple unicorn hybrids.
[01:08:08.210 --> 01:08:10.130]  Or the hybrids. Yeah.
[01:08:11.570 --> 01:08:12.850]  The purple unicorn.
[01:08:13.010 --> 01:08:13.810]  Purple unicorn.
[01:08:14.690 --> 01:08:22.130]  Yeah. Those are pretty unique. I didn't make a whole lot of those, probably a few hundred seeds.
[01:08:28.310 --> 01:08:34.710]  As far as the progeny goes, what I'm seeing is like for about 50% of the plants, they're more
[01:08:34.710 --> 01:08:41.910]  Urkel leaning. From my observation, the smaller plants, the more Urkel plants are the nicer
[01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:46.470]  plants are, the more colorful plants are, the plants with the turps that I'm looking for.
[01:08:51.750 --> 01:08:55.110]  They're smaller plants. They really take on more of the Urkel structure.
[01:08:56.630 --> 01:09:00.710]  There's a few taller, medium-sized plants in there that's kind of Hanalei leaning.
[01:09:01.350 --> 01:09:07.190]  But from my observation, like yeah, 50 to 60% of the plants are more Urkel leaning, smaller,
[01:09:07.670 --> 01:09:16.630]  really grape, sweet grape candy type smell. The unicorn adds a lot of cool traits to it as far as
[01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:21.670]  it brings more color to it, definitely. So it's like a real purple, purple Urkel.
[01:09:23.670 --> 01:09:29.750]  The colors on it are really cool. The flavors on it are really cool. And it's not all over the place.
[01:09:29.910 --> 01:09:39.750]  It's either a unicorn because it's an F5, so it's pretty much locked in. It's not breeding
[01:09:43.350 --> 01:09:50.230]  a huge variant. They're more Urkel or more unicorns, but really unique plants.
[01:09:50.470 --> 01:10:03.270]  As far as for people who know it's the Urkel and the purple unicorn, it pretty much speaks for
[01:10:03.270 --> 01:10:09.110]  itself. It's an amazing plant. I don't want to get on here and tout it up, but for people who know
[01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:14.790]  what those genetics are, could kind of like get an idea of what the outcomes are going to be.
[01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:23.430]  So I'll give people a little background. So Grasshopper had a F5 purple unicorn male that
[01:10:23.430 --> 01:10:31.430]  he hit to a bunch of different females. And I think he did Urkel to Runt to Honolae
[01:10:32.790 --> 01:10:39.830]  to a bunch of different things, Cherry Pie, Igreen, Honolae, purple unicorns.
[01:10:40.470 --> 01:10:46.070]  I culled all the purple ones because I wanted just to see the Honolae looking ones.
[01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:54.630]  And they still were all very purple pink. Very, very purple pink. I got one purple Pheno,
[01:10:54.630 --> 01:11:05.270]  and it was like solid purple. All of the plants looked really nice. I think that was probably one
[01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:13.990]  of the ones that I wish I would have grown sooner and earlier because the male, it's a purple
[01:11:13.990 --> 01:11:20.950]  unicorn F5. So the plants that are purple unicorn, you can tell super early. I was growing them
[01:11:20.950 --> 01:11:26.710]  outdoors. So you just see the purpling come on with males, with the females really, really early.
[01:11:27.670 --> 01:11:35.030]  The Vege, nice. And Flower, the Honolae leaning ones almost look kind of sour
[01:11:35.990 --> 01:11:39.750]  a little bit. The bud structure, it was that nice open bud structure.
[01:11:41.910 --> 01:11:50.710]  Yeah. I think we're going to put some of those on Daga under Ilyseeds. It's a pretty cool line.
[01:11:50.790 --> 01:11:57.190]  I mean, this is our shameless plugging of our own stuff, but I really think it's a good one. I mean,
[01:11:57.190 --> 01:12:04.310]  Bodhi knows what's up. And Grasshopper has been working with these specific cuts for a long time,
[01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:09.670]  or picked a Runts cut. I heard he looked through, what, three or four different Runts cuts to find
[01:12:09.670 --> 01:12:15.190]  this particular one. It's solid here, really solid here.
[01:12:15.830 --> 01:12:28.950]  Yeah. The Honolae unicorns, the Honolae breeds a certain, the specific terp across the board.
[01:12:29.590 --> 01:12:37.190]  And from what I see is like the unicorn male kind of allows these females to express
[01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:44.310]  in some unique type of way, and then bring the color and a mild berry undertone.
[01:12:44.310 --> 01:12:53.910]  So, Bodhi do great work. And it really shows in that purple unicorn male, how the structure
[01:12:53.910 --> 01:13:01.190]  is locked in, the color is locked in, and it's not breeding. It breeds homogenous,
[01:13:02.070 --> 01:13:09.190]  it's a homogenous plant for the color. And it really does well with that. And it allows
[01:13:10.070 --> 01:13:14.630]  it, you know, it allows the terps to kind of shine through from the female,
[01:13:15.190 --> 01:13:21.990]  you know, in a unique type way with adding a small berry tone. It's a really unique plant.
[01:13:21.990 --> 01:13:27.350]  It's not overpowering, you know, it overpower and it's dominant where you want it, where you
[01:13:27.350 --> 01:13:33.910]  need it to be in the color. Yeah, I was gonna say it has really nice color. Yeah, it's beautiful.
[01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:41.510]  It passed that trait on really, really nicely. And as far as the Urkel itself, the Urkel always
[01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:46.710]  breed, bred really well. And it's the same thing with the Urkel. I mean, it's the same thing was
[01:13:46.710 --> 01:13:51.190]  happening. Now, back in the day, there were, there were like three or four different cuts of Urkel
[01:13:51.190 --> 01:13:59.590]  circulating. You know, I ended up keeping the more, the colorful one, the one that really had
[01:13:59.590 --> 01:14:03.990]  the tighter buds and it was more colorful. But there were, you know, there was a Mendel
[01:14:03.990 --> 01:14:10.550]  perp cut that that's one I wish I had held on to. It's different than the Urkel. It's kind of sweeter
[01:14:10.550 --> 01:14:17.750]  and it's really still a bit bigger plant as well. But yeah, as far as the Urkel and the unicorn,
[01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:25.590]  the Hanalei unicorns and all these different hybrids that I did with it, they're really
[01:14:26.550 --> 01:14:31.830]  cherry unicorn I'm using in a back cross. I use the Urkel unicorn in the Urkel back cross,
[01:14:32.470 --> 01:14:37.190]  you know, so I'm using them as a part of, you know, some of my lines and my work as well.
[01:14:37.910 --> 01:14:44.470]  They're pretty unique. And most of the other crosses, there's, you know, there's,
[01:14:46.230 --> 01:14:52.070]  can't really remember. I had like, and then with those, those, those unicorns and those
[01:14:52.390 --> 01:15:01.750]  purple Urkel unicorns and Hanalei unicorns, I offered some free packs of mango unicorn
[01:15:03.990 --> 01:15:08.950]  to go along with those. And the mango unicorns, they're, you know, they're pretty unique plant
[01:15:08.950 --> 01:15:16.150]  as well. You know, the mango is one of the most medicinal plant we have. Back in the day,
[01:15:16.150 --> 01:15:23.510]  we kept it because of its medicinal properties. And also it's a great growing plant. It's one of
[01:15:23.510 --> 01:15:30.390]  the only plants that I have that really drips pollen or sap or whatever it is. I can't really
[01:15:30.390 --> 01:15:36.070]  explain what it is that it comes off of it, but it's really heady, heady, strong, sit you down
[01:15:36.070 --> 01:15:44.710]  type indica. And in 2007, we had an accident with, with, with a mango and it had hit the
[01:15:44.710 --> 01:15:50.470]  Urkel at one point in a stressful grow, probably got about three or four seeds. And I have a friend
[01:15:50.470 --> 01:15:56.710]  who is still growing that Urkel mango up until this day, since like 2007. And yeah, the mango is
[01:15:56.710 --> 01:16:03.670]  a unique one as well. It's supposed to be some Brazilian, Thai and Afghani, but it's, it's an early
[01:16:03.670 --> 01:16:11.830]  stocky indica that flowers in about eight weeks. And the turps on it is not a mango fruit,
[01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:17.910]  but if anybody have been to the Caribbean or been around any places or in the tropics where
[01:16:17.910 --> 01:16:24.630]  there's mangoes and you climb a mango tree or you break the leaves, it's a pungent, pungent smell
[01:16:24.630 --> 01:16:31.590]  that a mango plant has. And this is the smell that comes off the mangoes. Even the Mexican folks that,
[01:16:31.590 --> 01:16:35.270]  you know, we work on the farm somewhere, I shouldn't call them Mexican, but some of my
[01:16:36.070 --> 01:16:42.470]  veterans from across the border who would work with us, you know, they identify it as the tree,
[01:16:43.030 --> 01:16:47.990]  not the fruit itself. You know, so it's a very, very unique mango gum type,
[01:16:49.030 --> 01:16:54.390]  very pungent plant. And, you know, so I've been keeping that one over the years and working with
[01:16:54.390 --> 01:17:02.790]  them, you know, over the past 15 years, I got about five or six strains that we kept from back
[01:17:02.790 --> 01:17:10.870]  then that we still work with because they stand out back then. You know, I mean, a lot of things
[01:17:10.870 --> 01:17:19.270]  came and went along the way, but some things just stayed, you know, and even now I would pop a bunch
[01:17:19.270 --> 01:17:25.190]  of seeds, make selections, see something that I like, select it, put it into some breeding projects,
[01:17:25.190 --> 01:17:30.310]  see how it does. And, you know, and you would breed that for maybe three or four times a couple
[01:17:30.310 --> 01:17:35.030]  years, you let it go. But some things just stay around for a reason, like the Oracle, the Florida
[01:17:35.030 --> 01:17:42.230]  Ogee, the Oval Cut-Off Sour in the mango, the Cherry Pie is more recent, probably 12, 13 years, but
[01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:51.750]  it's another unique plant that, you know, breeds true and really homogenous for cherry turps.
[01:17:51.750 --> 01:17:57.670]  And that's coming from my F1, you know, so, you know, that's one of the reasons I say, well,
[01:17:57.670 --> 01:18:03.750]  you don't have to really have to feel your breed a plant down to five or six generations for it to be
[01:18:04.790 --> 01:18:13.430]  homozygous for just the trait that you want. You know, some plants are homozygous for these
[01:18:13.430 --> 01:18:20.230]  traits in the first generation. At F1, you could find plants that are, oh, this is, it was breeding
[01:18:20.790 --> 01:18:28.150]  six to 70, 80% of cherry into the progeny. So, and those are the reasons I keep those plants around,
[01:18:28.150 --> 01:18:34.150]  not because they are cherry or because they're named Cherry Pie. I could give a hell what it's
[01:18:34.150 --> 01:18:43.270]  called. I know it breeds well for some traits dominantly across the board, six to 70, sometimes
[01:18:43.270 --> 01:18:50.150]  up to 80%, depending on what you pair it up with. So those are the reasons those plants stay around
[01:18:50.470 --> 01:18:57.430]  for, because I see how they breed and how they duplicate and the chromosomes and everything
[01:18:57.430 --> 01:19:06.630]  carry out. So it's not about names and stuff. And as far as turps goes, and the tangy turps that
[01:19:07.510 --> 01:19:14.310]  that Hughie Jack had mentioned a while ago. Yeah, I like that tangy turps. I like very sharp turps.
[01:19:14.310 --> 01:19:19.670]  And this is one of the reasons I am in love with the Hanalei because it stands out. It's a sharp,
[01:19:19.670 --> 01:19:27.190]  pungent plant. And sometimes, you know, you want something that is mellow and tastes well and coats
[01:19:27.190 --> 01:19:33.510]  the mouth and lets you lick your lips, you know, as opposed to just some hashy, you know, so,
[01:19:33.510 --> 01:19:39.350]  and I go through different time of the days, different things, you know, like, you know,
[01:19:39.350 --> 01:19:43.910]  my friend just brought some black triangle over and it's like, yeah, that kind of like,
[01:19:44.470 --> 01:19:50.550]  feels like the mango a little bit. You know, you're not really functioning properly. So, you know,
[01:19:50.550 --> 01:19:57.510]  and then with the, sorry, I'm going back to the Urkel again, back to the Urkel with the
[01:19:57.510 --> 01:20:05.190]  purple unicorn, we paired up some Runtz unicorn with those as freebies. And then with the Hanalei
[01:20:05.190 --> 01:20:10.630]  unicorn, we paired up some mango unicorn with those as freebies. And then with the pure Hanalei,
[01:20:11.590 --> 01:20:19.750]  we paired up some Durban Hanalei as freebies to kind of like, you know, it's not about,
[01:20:20.870 --> 01:20:26.070]  you know, capitalizing here. It's about, there's so much work, there's so much things to offer.
[01:20:26.070 --> 01:20:36.150]  And, you know, if we could give people three for one, it's doing us justice because we have to,
[01:20:36.870 --> 01:20:42.150]  you know, sitting in the fridge, the potential just sit there has no meaning,
[01:20:42.150 --> 01:20:50.290]  has no significance until people actually get them in their hands. So, yeah.
[01:20:50.290 --> 01:20:51.090]  Thanks everyone.
[01:20:51.970 --> 01:20:56.130]  No, I mean, that's kind of just like a little sample of what our meetings are like. And,
[01:20:56.930 --> 01:21:04.850]  you know, we kind of like, try to bait you to like, pontificate on something, you know,
[01:21:04.930 --> 01:21:08.690]  like try to give you a little crumb, you know, and you'll start, you know, talking,
[01:21:08.690 --> 01:21:14.130]  we just sit there and I'm like, Oh, yeah, I never thought of it like that. Yeah, I mean,
[01:21:15.490 --> 01:21:25.730]  you know, like, I, gosh. Yeah, I mean, you know, I really like, you know, when you can dig into
[01:21:26.290 --> 01:21:30.370]  some pure genetics, then also dig into hybrid at the same time, because then you can kind of see
[01:21:31.170 --> 01:21:38.210]  what's contributing what to the line, you know, working with lines that are similar, but not
[01:21:38.210 --> 01:21:42.130]  exactly the same, you can get an idea of like, what's in each one and what you're looking for.
[01:21:42.770 --> 01:21:49.810]  Like, for example, like, you know, I looked into like, you know, a bit of some homilies.
[01:21:50.450 --> 01:21:56.450]  And it's pretty cool to kind of see like, okay, here's like, the plants that are similar to the
[01:21:56.450 --> 01:22:00.930]  one that Grasshopper has. So I remember him describing that one and seeing the pictures of
[01:22:00.930 --> 01:22:06.770]  it and smoking it. And then here are some hybrids that are a little bit more indica, you know,
[01:22:06.770 --> 01:22:10.370]  and a little bit more of like, what he was describing this, you know, what I was going
[01:22:10.370 --> 01:22:15.170]  to be seeing. And then here are some ones that are a little bit more hybrid and kind of, you know,
[01:22:15.170 --> 01:22:19.970]  going through them and having an idea of essentially what's in a population. I mean,
[01:22:19.970 --> 01:22:27.090]  that's really like what you're doing when you, that's kind of like, essentially the allure of
[01:22:27.650 --> 01:22:31.970]  phenohunting and popping seeds is you want to look and see what's in the population.
[01:22:32.610 --> 01:22:37.650]  And once you have an idea of what's in that population, you can kind of get a feel for what
[01:22:37.650 --> 01:22:45.410]  you what suits you, whether it's growing or the finished product, and then you kind of go in
[01:22:45.410 --> 01:22:52.290]  whatever direction you want. And it's pretty cool when you can work with breeders like Grasshopper
[01:22:52.290 --> 01:22:58.690]  and other people that are on here where you can communicate directly to them. When, you know,
[01:22:58.690 --> 01:23:04.130]  you can get other packs of things that are similar so that you can, you know, jump in and make your
[01:23:04.130 --> 01:23:12.690]  own versions of these things. Yeah, I mean, that's a really cool thing to do. I mean, you know,
[01:23:12.690 --> 01:23:16.690]  kind of something I kind of wanted to bring up and just talk about with Huey,
[01:23:18.130 --> 01:23:23.970]  which was we were looking through some S1s and we noticed that
[01:23:26.530 --> 01:23:31.970]  they're just not that vigorous and that we really wish that we had more of them to look through.
[01:23:35.250 --> 01:23:37.810]  I don't know, you want to elaborate on that at all? I mean.
[01:23:38.530 --> 01:23:46.290]  I mean, yeah, I mean, pretty much all the S1 population that I've run through,
[01:23:47.970 --> 01:23:55.410]  you really need to go through big hunts. There's a lot of trash in any S1. I mean,
[01:23:55.410 --> 01:24:01.330]  maybe you need some gold, but don't get me wrong, I'm not saying don't run them, but, you know, like,
[01:24:01.730 --> 01:24:10.130]  let's be honest, if you're running one seven pack of CSI S1s, you might find one good plant.
[01:24:10.770 --> 01:24:17.330]  And that's not to trash CSI, because Caleb's an amazing grower. I've just found that like
[01:24:17.330 --> 01:24:25.970]  the hybrid crosses work better in some things than S1 when you're dealing with a reversed
[01:24:26.370 --> 01:24:36.770]  plant as the pollen donor. That's my take. Some people may have much better luck than I have.
[01:24:37.810 --> 01:24:44.530]  Just, you know, after running, you know, two handfuls of stuff and talking to other people,
[01:24:46.130 --> 01:24:52.450]  it just seems like, you know, there's a lot of trash up in there and you got to just kind of,
[01:24:53.330 --> 01:24:56.850]  no pun intended, weed through it. What's your take, Nick?
[01:24:59.890 --> 01:25:07.010]  He's taking a big dab. So, you know, but hey, like, like I was saying, I tell you,
[01:25:07.010 --> 01:25:12.770]  it was, you know, that's some, that's very invasive, the type of breeding and you're gonna,
[01:25:12.770 --> 01:25:17.810]  you're gonna have those, you know, that's the first thing that gets challenged when you do
[01:25:17.810 --> 01:25:23.410]  incestuous type breeding is the vigor, you know, and structure and all of those things
[01:25:23.410 --> 01:25:28.530]  get compromised immediately. I mean, those guys used to claim that it was a 30% of the plant,
[01:25:28.530 --> 01:25:37.490]  but then, you know, it's more like 60%, you know, of the progeny of the S1 that's, you know,
[01:25:38.530 --> 01:25:47.410]  most people do something these days are feminized breeding because the, the population is so,
[01:25:48.530 --> 01:25:55.890]  complex or over poly or super complex is, it comes down to the point where, you know,
[01:25:55.890 --> 01:26:01.170]  they're all the way to get some decent kind of results is to do fems because if you take these
[01:26:01.170 --> 01:26:07.730]  things these days, then, I mean, they're all over the place trying to do some regular breeding with
[01:26:07.730 --> 01:26:13.970]  all the super complex hybrids these days is like, yeah. And that's one of the reasons I hold on to
[01:26:13.970 --> 01:26:19.970]  the stuff that breeds true because I could hit it and I could almost not test it, you know,
[01:26:19.970 --> 01:26:26.690]  because you know, you know how these things breed, you know what's happening, but most of the things
[01:26:26.690 --> 01:26:31.570]  that you work with today, you might as well test them and run them and look at them because,
[01:26:31.570 --> 01:26:36.130]  because a lot of it is, especially, you know, I'm talking about a different subject, but,
[01:26:37.010 --> 01:26:41.730]  you know, when it comes to breeding and stuff like that, and the only way that you get a decent
[01:26:41.730 --> 01:26:49.010]  result is by feminizing because then, you know, have the, the, the, the, other variances coming
[01:26:49.010 --> 01:26:55.330]  from the different males, you know, at least as females, they seem to pass certain traits on better
[01:26:56.050 --> 01:27:02.770]  with feminizing than if you try to do them in a regular stock. So it's just some, you know,
[01:27:04.210 --> 01:27:09.490]  those mutations and stuff is some, is some serious level of insight. I mean, we do feel your
[01:27:09.490 --> 01:27:14.370]  breeding, we go down the line, you know, that's the incest, you know, brothers and sisters,
[01:27:14.370 --> 01:27:18.450]  brothers and sisters for generations after generation. And we noticed that by the first,
[01:27:18.450 --> 01:27:21.410]  second, third generation, there's a lot of things that is getting compromised,
[01:27:23.090 --> 01:27:30.450]  you know, and when you take something and put it into itself where, you know, where the,
[01:27:31.410 --> 01:27:36.050]  you know, some serious level of incestuous breeding, then you have even more compromises
[01:27:36.050 --> 01:27:41.650]  taking place, you know, and vigor is one of them that shows up really well, flower structure,
[01:27:42.450 --> 01:27:48.610]  you know, terms are usually there, but as far as does it grow well, does it root well,
[01:27:49.650 --> 01:27:53.970]  you know, those are the issues with, with that type of, you know, I've did some,
[01:27:55.570 --> 01:28:02.450]  I don't have too many experiences with, with doing fems, but I have grown fems, and I, you know, my,
[01:28:03.250 --> 01:28:09.490]  my experience with it is, is exactly what you guys are saying. You're not, you're not getting
[01:28:09.490 --> 01:28:14.530]  10 for 10, you know, it's more like 3 for 10, something like that.
[01:28:15.730 --> 01:28:19.330]  A lot of mutations in S1s is what I've noticed too, so.
[01:28:21.010 --> 01:28:25.730]  I mean, you, you make your own with S1s and you grow them out, so it's like, you know, the proof
[01:28:25.730 --> 01:28:31.090]  is in the pudding, you know, people can say what they want, market it how they want, but here is
[01:28:31.090 --> 01:28:38.290]  someone in the, in our club, a member, you know, Jamal as well, Jamal has done his feminizing work
[01:28:38.290 --> 01:28:44.450]  and is running those populations and have run those populations, and this is, this is the data
[01:28:44.450 --> 01:28:51.010]  that we see, you know, so everybody else can get up there and, you know, I feel like when you buy
[01:28:51.010 --> 01:28:56.210]  a pack of feminized seeds, it should be three times as much coming in there for the price, sorry.
[01:28:56.370 --> 01:28:56.870]  Right.
[01:28:57.170 --> 01:29:05.570]  Yeah, because it's kind of, you know, like 60, 70% of it is, is, is not viable or, no, I shouldn't
[01:29:05.570 --> 01:29:10.930]  say viable, but it's not, doesn't have any quality to them.
[01:29:12.370 --> 01:29:18.290]  I know, I know all the feminized breeders out there like saying cheers for someone for saying
[01:29:18.290 --> 01:29:20.770]  that, you know, because it does, it's like.
[01:29:21.490 --> 01:29:22.690]  I don't know if they're cheering.
[01:29:22.770 --> 01:29:28.530]  I don't know if they're necessarily cheering on it, like, dude, you just,
[01:29:29.810 --> 01:29:34.530]  my part, you just rained on our parade, or trying to rain on our parade, you know, because I mean,
[01:29:34.530 --> 01:29:39.250]  feminizing, there's probably a hundred bucks for six. It's like, come on now, and I'm guaranteeing
[01:29:39.250 --> 01:29:45.330]  maybe one good plant out of there, hold up here, you know.
[01:29:45.490 --> 01:29:50.610]  Like, I think there's something to be said about feminized hybrids versus S1s.
[01:29:50.610 --> 01:29:51.410]  Of course.
[01:29:52.130 --> 01:29:59.890]  You know, like, like, I've noticed that feminized hybrids have, have been fine.
[01:29:59.890 --> 01:30:01.010]  They're outcrosses.
[01:30:01.010 --> 01:30:08.050]  Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And it's kind of like, I don't know, kind of like me and Huey were talking
[01:30:08.050 --> 01:30:14.130]  about what was it like some sherb S1s or something and like, like, kind of what I was talking about.
[01:30:14.370 --> 01:30:18.610]  Like, kind of what I was thinking was like, shoot, we should just make our own so we could
[01:30:18.610 --> 01:30:23.010]  actually hunt through enough that would be necessary to really find something special.
[01:30:23.730 --> 01:30:29.490]  And that I would feel almost a little nervous, only hunting through six or seven seeds to really
[01:30:29.490 --> 01:30:35.170]  find something if you know that, like, you know, then you're, you may not even be looking through
[01:30:35.170 --> 01:30:39.650]  six, you might be looking through four or three or whatever. But I mean, shoot, if you can look
[01:30:39.650 --> 01:30:42.130]  through like 40 of them that are good.
[01:30:42.770 --> 01:30:48.930]  Yeah, if you got enough, I'd say you'd be fine. But if you got, you know, a 10 pack, even you're,
[01:30:49.890 --> 01:30:53.250]  you're not getting very far. I mean, you know, you might get from
[01:30:53.970 --> 01:30:58.130]  might get one, two plants out of a 10 pack if you're lucky, you know.
[01:30:59.570 --> 01:31:01.890]  From the get go, you could see the plants that are gonna go,
[01:31:03.090 --> 01:31:08.770]  you know, from the get go, from like, three weeks, they do like, oh, shit. Okay. These are
[01:31:08.770 --> 01:31:14.130]  just not doing anything. And you got this one here that's really behaving like it should. So I
[01:31:14.130 --> 01:31:18.450]  mean, you know, you could start your 40. And then, you know, after three weeks, you're already
[01:31:18.450 --> 01:31:23.730]  eliminating, eliminating, eliminating, you know, if space is a concern, you know, you start with
[01:31:23.730 --> 01:31:30.210]  a higher number and eliminate down to your best 10 out of 40 or something, and then work that in
[01:31:30.210 --> 01:31:35.330]  your space. But trying to start 10 for your space, you might end up having more space than plants.
[01:31:35.330 --> 01:31:43.890]  Oh, Hughie, you're muted.
[01:31:46.290 --> 01:31:52.610]  Diamond Presco, I will agree, six or seven isn't really a bad. But then again, on the flip side,
[01:31:52.610 --> 01:32:00.210]  to be devil's advocate, probably some of the most sought after elite genetics came from less than
[01:32:00.210 --> 01:32:08.850]  five. So yeah, a couple of them say come saw, I would agree with you. You know, I think 24 is
[01:32:09.490 --> 01:32:15.170]  a number where you could say you at least had to do a population, you know, because at least you,
[01:32:15.170 --> 01:32:20.050]  you have a good idea. But yeah, sorry, I didn't mean to cut anybody off there.
[01:32:21.330 --> 01:32:25.730]  And I mean, also, that's good to know, like, if you hunt through a pack or two and find something
[01:32:25.730 --> 01:32:29.010]  killer, you should be able to find something killer again.
[01:32:30.610 --> 01:32:35.650]  You might have got really lucky though, on on that one pack, though, too. And you could have just
[01:32:36.370 --> 01:32:42.130]  one seed that, you know, so that's not always the case. But you know, you could have just got
[01:32:42.130 --> 01:32:46.610]  one lucky son of a bitch. And you know, just like a lot of a lot of these strains have been,
[01:32:46.610 --> 01:32:53.730]  you know, that are were, you know, made off of, you know, had a great fucking seed.
[01:32:54.050 --> 01:33:00.130]  I found my kind of blockberry from one seed. You know, it was like,
[01:33:01.010 --> 01:33:03.490]  it's not gonna do anything. And it was like, holy shit.
[01:33:04.130 --> 01:33:11.810]  Oh, I mean, all of this, all of this speaks to, you know, the type of breeding again, because
[01:33:11.810 --> 01:33:19.010]  even in even if you look at regular type breeding, you know, there is depending on
[01:33:19.010 --> 01:33:28.530]  depending on how complex those plants are, it's just hard to find good plants in 10 pack,
[01:33:28.530 --> 01:33:35.410]  you know. And back again, to one of the reasons I hold the older strain, because, you know, I could
[01:33:35.410 --> 01:33:39.810]  even with regular seeds with some things, you know, you could grab a couple of seeds, because
[01:33:40.450 --> 01:33:45.410]  the way they breed, and you will guarantee a couple good plants. But it just doesn't work
[01:33:45.410 --> 01:33:50.530]  out with the cookies these days. And it seems like it seems that I don't know if there's any,
[01:33:51.170 --> 01:33:54.370]  I think they did that on purpose, though, just so you buy more seeds.
[01:33:55.330 --> 01:34:01.730]  Exactly. I don't know if there's any, any factual scientific truth to, you know, if a plant has
[01:34:01.730 --> 01:34:08.450]  only three or four seeds, versus three or 400 seeds, you know, because it seems like you find
[01:34:08.450 --> 01:34:15.730]  one or two seeds, you know, from a from an accidental, they're always amazing. But when you
[01:34:15.730 --> 01:34:23.010]  family induced, like you actually do it, you're finding out that you're having experiences are,
[01:34:23.730 --> 01:34:29.250]  and mutations are higher and stuff like that. So I don't know, I thought,
[01:34:30.210 --> 01:34:36.210]  I love those baby Jesus seeds, like I like to call them, because like, you could have a plant.
[01:34:36.210 --> 01:34:40.930]  And then all of a sudden, you go to a plant, a giant plant, and there's one seed, like,
[01:34:40.930 --> 01:34:47.010]  where the fuck did it come from? Nothing, her nothing, but there's one seed, giant seed.
[01:34:47.010 --> 01:34:50.450]  And I call that the baby Jesus seed. Always hold on to those.
[01:34:52.450 --> 01:34:54.930]  You know, there's a lot of stuff come from,
[01:34:56.050 --> 01:35:01.490]  you know, it's like nothing, her no pollen, but it's like one seed, what the fuck?
[01:35:01.970 --> 01:35:08.690]  Um, so does anybody? Yeah, I'll say, if anybody hasn't checked out grasshoppers genetics,
[01:35:09.330 --> 01:35:15.890]  um, you know, they're on Daga right now, you can get them through Jamal and with I Lee seeds.
[01:35:16.530 --> 01:35:24.370]  I'm a fan was a fan before he was a member. Um, so yeah, if you're on here, you want some killer
[01:35:24.450 --> 01:35:33.330]  shit of all ranges, check it out. Yeah. I'm gonna I mean, I'm gonna I'm asking, I'll be asking
[01:35:33.330 --> 01:35:42.210]  grasshopper. I'd like to take those to like F3, you know, some of those Hanalei purple unicorn
[01:35:42.210 --> 01:35:47.010]  or some of those one of the purple unicorn hybrids cuz I mean, man, that's special.
[01:35:48.130 --> 01:35:53.170]  Those are really special plants. And that's the whole idea. That's the idea of, you know, because
[01:35:53.730 --> 01:35:59.410]  I've never seen a plant from the islands that stands out like that. I've seen wild ways,
[01:35:59.410 --> 01:36:05.090]  I've seen different things, but this one is pretty unique. And that's the whole idea. Jamal is,
[01:36:06.290 --> 01:36:12.690]  you know, I took it, I preserved it. So there is 5% or less intersex trait
[01:36:14.050 --> 01:36:18.690]  in them, you know, and that, you know, that could be cleaned up. I think you probably can,
[01:36:18.690 --> 01:36:22.770]  you know, got through that part of it already by just taking it to a second generation.
[01:36:23.410 --> 01:36:28.850]  And by, you know, by selecting it one more time and taking it to a third generation and,
[01:36:28.850 --> 01:36:36.050]  you know, making a true IBL from it is, it's, you know, the goal is to get it
[01:36:37.490 --> 01:36:44.930]  preserved and pure in a form where the population or the progeny is not expressing,
[01:36:45.250 --> 01:36:53.330]  you know, less than a percent or zero percent of intersex trait. Right now, they're amazing plants.
[01:36:53.330 --> 01:36:58.530]  That little small part of it exists, but they're at least less than 5%. It's not something that I'm
[01:36:58.530 --> 01:37:05.170]  concerned about. I've never seen it in a P1. Jamal have seen small on one, one out of 20.
[01:37:06.530 --> 01:37:11.170]  And to be expected, they're straight from the source. You know, I've preserved them directly
[01:37:11.170 --> 01:37:18.210]  from the show source and shared them and also have them available on Gaga. But yeah, please
[01:37:18.210 --> 01:37:24.530]  move forward and it would be good to have it in as best possible. You know, I just, my focus is
[01:37:24.530 --> 01:37:31.490]  preserve, put away, select, and using hybrids. Preserve, put away, select, using hybrids over
[01:37:31.490 --> 01:37:35.730]  a period of time. I never thought that that one would ever make it out, but it's a unique one.
[01:37:35.730 --> 01:37:40.850]  Whoever has a chance to experience it is going to experience a real island sativa,
[01:37:41.650 --> 01:37:53.330]  early type sativa, 10, 12 weeks. Yeah, very, very electric, upbeat. You know, there's nothing
[01:37:53.410 --> 01:38:06.050]  down about it as far as the experience. I really enjoy that herb because it takes me down the
[01:38:06.050 --> 01:38:09.970]  rabbit hole. It makes me feel like I'm a mad scientist when I'm starting to breed. I think
[01:38:11.890 --> 01:38:18.770]  about limitless possibilities and oh, well, it's not just possibilities, it's just outcomes. It
[01:38:19.650 --> 01:38:27.570]  carries you deep into your thoughts and I think as a breeder, as a deep thinker, as someone who is,
[01:38:27.570 --> 01:38:34.930]  you know, observing nature on every level, I'm impaired so I try to get the most out of nature,
[01:38:34.930 --> 01:38:43.650]  colors, whatever there is. And yeah, those are the plants that really heightens that experience and,
[01:38:43.650 --> 01:38:50.770]  you know, put you on that Wi-Fi to nature. It's just an amazing plant. It's not sedating and
[01:38:50.770 --> 01:38:58.050]  sit you down and la la and hungry. It's a great experience and, you know, and this is how we,
[01:38:58.050 --> 01:39:05.090]  like Jamal was saying, this is how we experience how the people from Hawaii, the people from
[01:39:05.090 --> 01:39:12.050]  Africa, the people, we're having their experience to a certain extent and understanding, you know,
[01:39:14.050 --> 01:39:20.770]  how people think and what drives their thoughts and, you know, these things are very, very
[01:39:21.810 --> 01:39:29.730]  effective in that way and I love them, especially the Hanalei, the Hanalei hybrids. Everything I
[01:39:29.730 --> 01:39:37.730]  have put, paired up with the Hanalei has been amazing plants. The Hanalei dogs, amazing plants
[01:39:37.730 --> 01:39:45.410]  again. The grape Hanalei is amazing plants again. Yeah, every time. So, I have nothing bad to say
[01:39:45.410 --> 01:39:52.050]  about the Hanalei, even though there's that small, less than 5% in that second generation and I have
[01:39:52.050 --> 01:39:57.170]  different lines of it as well. So, Jamal is working with the guava phenol of it. Then I have more sour
[01:39:57.170 --> 01:40:05.410]  guava, sweet guava and some more carrot and more train wreck lines that I have kind of not just
[01:40:05.410 --> 01:40:11.330]  open pollinated it, but kind of selected it and bred it in different directions and I could see
[01:40:11.330 --> 01:40:17.090]  the different, I could see it in the progeny that I've bred it in different directions. You can see
[01:40:17.090 --> 01:40:22.690]  these are more guava leaning in this progeny, this progeny is more of the carrot phenol and so it's
[01:40:22.690 --> 01:40:27.090]  an amazing experience. You know, it's funny because like in the ones that I was looking
[01:40:27.090 --> 01:40:35.250]  through, I definitely found one train wreck leaning one, which was like the fattest one,
[01:40:35.250 --> 01:40:41.490]  the highest yielding one, but I smelled it and I was like, I see that's the train wreck leaning one.
[01:40:41.490 --> 01:40:47.570]  Kind of smelled like Thai peanut a little bit. Train wreck on steroids, Diana, like really pungent.
[01:40:47.570 --> 01:40:56.450]  Yeah, yeah, really pungent and then interesting, I saw, I found a few that looked very similar now
[01:40:56.450 --> 01:41:04.130]  to the picture of Hanalei that's on St. Copa's Instagram. Oh yeah, those are, yeah, those are
[01:41:04.130 --> 01:41:10.290]  some amazing outdoor ones. That's the more, I would say that's the carrot kind of jack leaning
[01:41:11.410 --> 01:41:17.250]  phenol. I mean, I thought it was interesting also like it turned this really interesting
[01:41:17.250 --> 01:41:22.690]  purple color kind of with the sun. I don't know if it's with the cold, but it has this
[01:41:22.690 --> 01:41:27.410]  interesting color fade to it and then these really cool hybrids and actually one of them
[01:41:27.410 --> 01:41:36.530]  in Diva I wanted to get to you. It has a very like loose structure to it. Like there's a few
[01:41:36.530 --> 01:41:43.970]  that have like a loose structure but still have great trichrome production. Yeah, the trichrome
[01:41:43.970 --> 01:41:49.890]  on them are excellent. You know what I mean? It's kind of like noduled in a certain way where like
[01:41:49.890 --> 01:41:57.570]  it wouldn't really be the keeper for like flower production, but for washing it could really work
[01:41:57.570 --> 01:42:06.210]  out nice. And then there was a few phenos that are like kind of chunky and like, yeah, I mean there's
[01:42:06.210 --> 01:42:11.570]  a few different phenos but definitely groups of them. Like it wasn't just all over the place. Like
[01:42:11.570 --> 01:42:17.490]  there's just like three different types and like one that I was thinking Huey you might be interested
[01:42:17.490 --> 01:42:25.730]  in that was like pretty short. Yeah, I mean for me I'm kind of thinking of a pheno that's like
[01:42:28.130 --> 01:42:35.730]  kind of like a sativa version but maybe a little bit shorter because they can stretch and get a
[01:42:35.730 --> 01:42:42.370]  little intimidating with how tall they can get. But you know if you pick the right phenos it should
[01:42:42.370 --> 01:42:52.370]  be cool. And I mean I jumped in, did like a seed expansion hunt. So are those what? Are those F3s now?
[01:42:53.490 --> 01:42:58.770]  Cross-over? Yeah, I mean if you want to call them that. I mean, yeah. Or is it just like,
[01:42:58.770 --> 01:43:03.890]  would that just be like an F3 in a specific direction? Well those might be, I mean if we're
[01:43:03.890 --> 01:43:09.970]  looking at a phenotype too, yeah that's what I would say. Those would be an F2 that you made.
[01:43:10.130 --> 01:43:18.690]  Okay, yeah. Or you know because, or really F3, yeah. Or is that like a bat cross?
[01:43:20.370 --> 01:43:27.810]  Say again? A bat cross or like a open pollination? Well I did the open pollination in the first,
[01:43:28.930 --> 01:43:34.370]  the first, because I have open pollination off Hanalei as well. And then I selected the best
[01:43:34.370 --> 01:43:41.570]  males, best females, and wind down, kind of selected, wind down the males to the best possible
[01:43:41.570 --> 01:43:47.090]  male and then hit that with all the best females. So that was, that was, if you know, you could call
[01:43:47.090 --> 01:43:55.250]  that the F2. Okay. And then you know for coming after the open pollination and then you probably
[01:43:55.250 --> 01:44:00.370]  are the F3. But what do you think about the turps on it and the palate on it? The palate is like
[01:44:01.090 --> 01:44:07.810]  no other, it's soft. It's really, I would describe it as like, I would describe it as maybe like
[01:44:07.810 --> 01:44:13.170]  perfume, Island Sweet Skunk is kind of a strain that I remember back in the day that it kind of
[01:44:13.170 --> 01:44:21.730]  reminded me of. It has like, yeah, maybe like cotton, I don't know if you guys ever smoked
[01:44:21.810 --> 01:44:28.050]  cotton candy before. Yes. Kind of like that kind of, like kind of turps to it.
[01:44:31.890 --> 01:44:38.370]  It's like this perfumey fruity type of smell, but it's like this potent, it's like,
[01:44:39.330 --> 01:44:42.450]  would say it's like, I mean, yeah, like you said, it's like a guava.
[01:44:42.450 --> 01:44:50.370]  Guava, basically, is what you're, how you would describe it. I mean, most of them,
[01:44:51.010 --> 01:44:55.330]  they're very, they're very uniform for turp production, for smell.
[01:44:56.770 --> 01:45:00.450]  It's just really like the structure and like which kind of plant you're looking for.
[01:45:03.170 --> 01:45:06.690]  And then, you know, I've hit all of those one more direction. So like,
[01:45:06.770 --> 01:45:13.170]  you know, I'll have, you know, all the different phenos then hit to that one male that I chose,
[01:45:13.810 --> 01:45:19.170]  which is a purple one. I didn't see that many purple in the population. So I'm hoping that
[01:45:19.170 --> 01:45:26.130]  takes the kind of back more to the direction that that female in that picture is going.
[01:45:27.490 --> 01:45:37.140]  Yeah. So we go through the the eight commandments of collective.
[01:45:38.980 --> 01:45:42.500]  Whether go, we already did the beginning, I thought.
[01:45:44.100 --> 01:45:47.140]  I just wanted to know, was there anything anybody else wanted to touch on?
[01:45:51.090 --> 01:46:00.140]  Um, I mean, anything else to touch on? I mean,
[01:46:00.620 --> 01:46:10.380]  talked about fems, talked about stuff going out. I mean, you can, you're welcome to talk about what
[01:46:10.380 --> 01:46:11.820]  you want to put on Aili Seeds.
[01:46:12.460 --> 01:46:21.100]  All right, cool. So as Grasshopper was mentioning earlier about, you know, homogenous traits.
[01:46:22.700 --> 01:46:26.940]  I'm going to drop some of my pixie, which is kind of like a tangy,
[01:46:27.900 --> 01:46:36.380]  they're F1s, but they breed true orange turps. You know, multiple people have grown them.
[01:46:37.500 --> 01:46:41.340]  You know, we've, you know, five different times, they're totally stable.
[01:46:42.060 --> 01:46:48.220]  They range in from, from swish, you know, fresh squeezed orange juice, all the way up to almost,
[01:46:48.860 --> 01:46:54.300]  like, almost grapefruit. So true breeder of a homogenous trait.
[01:46:55.260 --> 01:47:01.260]  So true breeder of orange turps, if you want them, some of the pheno will turn
[01:47:02.380 --> 01:47:08.860]  purple towards the end, regardless of temps. We'll be putting those up on Aili Seeds.
[01:47:10.300 --> 01:47:14.700]  You know, those are, those are good breeding strain. If you want to put some orange
[01:47:15.500 --> 01:47:20.220]  into what you're working with. Like, I can tell you what to look for.
[01:47:20.940 --> 01:47:26.940]  You know, since we've grown it enough, my favorite pheno was like, almost the cookie
[01:47:26.940 --> 01:47:35.820]  looking pheno. It was the runt more of anything. We found it twice, and it smelled like an orange
[01:47:35.820 --> 01:47:44.380]  creamsicle. It tasted like orange creamsicle. Not a big producer, crazy high, crazy high,
[01:47:44.380 --> 01:47:48.140]  but turps were on point. I'll jump in. During the pandemic,
[01:47:48.140 --> 01:47:54.540]  one of our other members was growing one, took the plant, rubbed my fingers on it,
[01:47:54.540 --> 01:48:01.900]  rubbed it on my, my mask of the day, and I had orange flavored turps in my mask. It was amazing.
[01:48:03.260 --> 01:48:08.860]  So we'll be putting those up on Aili Seeds. And then I thought I would put some of my more
[01:48:10.780 --> 01:48:16.940]  limited stuff that I did. You know, grasshoppers. Sorry, I'm a little froggy today.
[01:48:17.660 --> 01:48:23.580]  Everybody. We got some forbidden fruit ET. That's up in the mix here soon.
[01:48:25.260 --> 01:48:31.420]  But grasshopper was talking about how, you know, he uses the purple ergal that he's had for a long
[01:48:31.420 --> 01:48:43.660]  time. I don't have cuts from that long back, but I have held on to the THC bomb cut since 2014.
[01:48:44.220 --> 01:48:50.860]  And I lost it and I got it back and I use that. So we're going to get some strawberry diesel
[01:48:50.860 --> 01:48:59.900]  space dude, male cross to the THC bomb mom. Definitely cherry cough syrup, turps, small
[01:49:00.700 --> 01:49:05.180]  stacky structure plant. And then I'm also going to throw up the strawberry diesel male
[01:49:06.140 --> 01:49:14.540]  cross to the OG banana OG cut the real banana OG cut. And those have been proven by other members
[01:49:15.100 --> 01:49:21.340]  that, you know, grow pretty solid. I made a limited amount of each. We'll put those up there.
[01:49:22.940 --> 01:49:29.420]  They're pretty small stacking plants. Definitely bag appeal on both. I don't think there was an
[01:49:29.420 --> 01:49:35.900]  ugly Fino. I mean, if that's your thing, turps were interesting. That male brought
[01:49:37.180 --> 01:49:44.300]  pretty much strawberry cough syrup to everything. So the space dude was sweet. The strawberry diesel,
[01:49:45.100 --> 01:49:50.940]  if you know, just isn't really diesel, but it's also not really strawberry cough either.
[01:49:52.220 --> 01:49:57.580]  So we'll do those. And then I'm also going to have some Kona sunset crosses coming up
[01:49:57.660 --> 01:50:01.820]  that I'm going to drop. That's my next project of what I'm working on this year
[01:50:03.100 --> 01:50:11.420]  is a Kona sunset male. What have I had that for like a year and a half now? I'll have Paul in for
[01:50:11.420 --> 01:50:18.140]  all the collective members and I'm keeping the male cut. But we'll have some, you know, gelato 41
[01:50:18.140 --> 01:50:27.820]  Kona sunset, THC bomb, Kona sunset, straw Nana, 14 or cut Kona sunset, you know, just some turpy
[01:50:27.820 --> 01:50:36.060]  stuff. Yeah. You know, I think I've given a few men of that male out there. Definitely. I'd love
[01:50:36.060 --> 01:50:42.540]  to hit the Hanalei Kona sunset, you know, just to keep those kind of old school Hawaiian genes,
[01:50:43.100 --> 01:50:49.020]  you know, going, but just some interesting stuff for like, we all, you know, grasshopper works on
[01:50:49.020 --> 01:50:54.140]  different stuff. Jamal's got his project going right now. You know, I'm doing kind of my own
[01:50:54.140 --> 01:51:03.660]  thing. I'm also hunting cams, cam variations for the collective as well. And grasshopper graciously
[01:51:03.660 --> 01:51:10.780]  donated some older genetics that I'm going to lovingly try to preserve and hunt through for
[01:51:10.780 --> 01:51:17.260]  future breeding purposes. So yeah, interesting things coming up with the group. You know,
[01:51:17.820 --> 01:51:27.260]  when I jump in real quick, Huey stuff is, or Huey is a tent grower. Yeah. And, you know,
[01:51:27.260 --> 01:51:31.740]  so other people who are tent growers are looking for genetics for tent growers.
[01:51:32.300 --> 01:51:37.180]  Definitely look, look at his gear. Cause you know, I mean, there's different, there's stuff
[01:51:37.180 --> 01:51:41.340]  that gets tall and stuff that's short and all different kinds of things in different situations.
[01:51:41.340 --> 01:51:46.220]  So I would just encourage you, you know, if you are a tent grower to look into his gear, cause it,
[01:51:47.180 --> 01:51:51.740]  it's the right height so that you can be successful and, you know, like yields properly,
[01:51:51.740 --> 01:51:58.060]  he chooses certain kinds of stuff that works for him. Yeah. And I'll always let people know stretch
[01:51:58.060 --> 01:52:03.580]  cause I test all this stuff before putting it out there. So like, that's one of the things I'll
[01:52:03.580 --> 01:52:11.660]  disclose and as much information as possible about what to find, you know, and, and I'll be
[01:52:11.660 --> 01:52:17.740]  the first one to tell you as grasshopper did, you know, if there's any intersex traits, we're going
[01:52:17.740 --> 01:52:24.780]  to, we're going to disclose that as well as, you know, if something has intersex traits and I don't
[01:52:24.780 --> 01:52:29.180]  feel that it's worth putting out there, cause it would be a disappointment. I'm not going to put
[01:52:29.180 --> 01:52:35.420]  it out there. And I've been accused by many people in our groups by being a little too picky,
[01:52:35.420 --> 01:52:43.340]  but that's just, that's me. So, you know, I'm going to continue to do my own thing. But, you know,
[01:52:43.340 --> 01:52:48.940]  that's one thing we've all discussed is you know, test your gear, put as much information you
[01:52:48.940 --> 01:52:55.340]  possibly can on what you see in the progeny. And that's something you're going to see from, you
[01:52:55.340 --> 01:53:02.460]  know, Aili Seeds, you know, Jamal's got a pretty good thing going. Grasshopper's got some fire
[01:53:03.020 --> 01:53:10.620]  on there right now that all of y'all can, you know, hook up and get. But yeah, so.
[01:53:11.340 --> 01:53:17.100]  And I mean, you know, like, like I'm going to be taking some of the same stuff to F2, F3.
[01:53:18.300 --> 01:53:23.260]  So I mean, basically like, you know, I'm not, we're not saying like, oh, buy this stuff. Cause
[01:53:23.260 --> 01:53:28.700]  it's our stuff. Like I would get it just because it's really cool, fun gear out there. I mean,
[01:53:28.700 --> 01:53:32.300]  there's a lot of other people who also have really cool gear, you know, and you should get their
[01:53:32.300 --> 01:53:37.580]  stuff too. Cause it's not going to be around. But I don't know if like, if you can get like the Bodie
[01:53:38.220 --> 01:53:47.180]  Purple Unicorn F5, and you want purple stuff, get it. It's a great line. You know, like the other
[01:53:47.180 --> 01:53:52.140]  thing I would say is like, really be choosing on who you buy your seeds from, you know, like
[01:53:52.140 --> 01:53:57.260]  definitely don't, you know, have to purchase them from us, but purchase them from people who are
[01:53:57.260 --> 01:54:02.460]  like roots, you know, and who are going to give you good customer support and people that you vibe
[01:54:02.460 --> 01:54:07.660]  with. And, you know, like you're, we're really lucky now that we're in this time when you can
[01:54:07.660 --> 01:54:13.340]  communicate so intimately with all of these different breeders. And so you can find somebody
[01:54:13.340 --> 01:54:19.820]  that really does gel with you and choose to support them. You don't have to just buy seeds
[01:54:19.820 --> 01:54:25.580]  from random people from Amsterdam and Spain and whatever, like some huge companies, you just don't
[01:54:25.580 --> 01:54:31.580]  need to do that anymore. You can reach out to people. And so many of these breeders will get
[01:54:31.580 --> 01:54:36.460]  back to you and send you an email list of all the things that they have and give you really fair
[01:54:36.460 --> 01:54:47.740]  pricing and really can give you a, give you a good description. And to me, that is way more valuable
[01:54:47.740 --> 01:54:53.180]  than the pack of seeds. It's that interaction with this person. So for example, like Doc D
[01:54:53.180 --> 01:55:03.420]  Seeds, awesome, awesome guy, great genetics and communicate with you. And it's just so awesome that,
[01:55:03.420 --> 01:55:10.460]  you know, Snow High, same thing, you know, he'll, he gets back to you and like, it's great to just
[01:55:10.460 --> 01:55:15.820]  have that. Red Scare Seeds, he was just on the last show. Like there are people you can communicate
[01:55:15.820 --> 01:55:24.060]  with who have seeds and get them from those people, not just random people who like won't even
[01:55:24.060 --> 01:55:31.100]  communicate with you. There are tons of people on Daga who are mad roots, who really breed things
[01:55:31.100 --> 01:55:37.020]  that are not very common and you should support them. Like they know what they're doing. There
[01:55:37.020 --> 01:55:44.540]  are people, FilioFeel, like there's so many people on that have awesome, awesome gear. It's so unique.
[01:55:46.780 --> 01:55:48.620]  You know, support those people.
[01:55:52.290 --> 01:55:52.530]  Yeah.
[01:55:52.530 --> 01:55:53.410]  Hold on, Nolan.
[01:56:00.130 --> 01:56:03.170]  So yeah, we have a couple minutes left.
[01:56:04.770 --> 01:56:11.570]  Like, you know, like I can say this even for bigger names, like I'd much rather communicate
[01:56:11.570 --> 01:56:19.810]  and get Sherb crosses from Boston Roots than Seed Junkie. Like that's just, you know, not to bag
[01:56:19.810 --> 01:56:26.130]  on Seed Junkie because there's been fire, you know, at his gear, but, you know, Boston Roots
[01:56:26.130 --> 01:56:33.970]  seems to put out a little bit more information. And as far as I'm, you know, like I'm not in that
[01:56:33.970 --> 01:56:39.410]  realm of things, but, you know, it's been willing to communicate, you know, and that was key. You
[01:56:39.410 --> 01:56:44.130]  know, that's what turned it on. So, you know, it was like to kind of solidify what Jamal was saying,
[01:56:44.130 --> 01:56:49.490]  you know, find people that are going to give you info. They're going to answer your questions.
[01:56:51.010 --> 01:56:56.850]  You know, and that's where stuff comes from, you know, people that are just transparent and
[01:56:56.850 --> 01:57:01.650]  have the willing to talk about your, you know, that are, that are kind of nerds like we are,
[01:57:01.650 --> 01:57:06.690]  you know, about it, you know, because most good breeders are going to want to nerd out on their
[01:57:06.690 --> 01:57:12.610]  stuff with other people, you know, at least the good ones are, you know, and that's the difference.
[01:57:13.170 --> 01:57:17.650]  I'd say I wouldn't give my money to anybody that wouldn't respond to you and won't answer
[01:57:17.650 --> 01:57:21.650]  your questions. That's, that's for sure. They can't give you the time of day. Why should you
[01:57:21.650 --> 01:57:26.610]  give them your hard earned money, you know, so give somebody that can help you and talk to you
[01:57:26.610 --> 01:57:31.090]  and, well, you know, they answer your questions that you have, you know, and you should have
[01:57:31.090 --> 01:57:36.130]  answer, you know, you should have questions, you know, you know, for your seed that you're going to
[01:57:36.130 --> 01:57:40.290]  get no matter what they are, you know, I mean, there are certain people that have tons of
[01:57:40.290 --> 01:57:44.930]  information that they put out with them, but I mean, there's still information you can always ask,
[01:57:44.930 --> 01:57:54.130]  you know, so yeah, transparency is key. So, you know, with your breeders anyways, or who you buy
[01:57:54.210 --> 01:58:01.410]  from, I mean, I wouldn't say don't always go to, you know, like, stay away from Craigslist. I mean,
[01:58:01.410 --> 01:58:09.730]  most of us, I mean, sometimes, but most of them, they're greedy, want money, and they don't care,
[01:58:09.730 --> 01:58:17.410]  you know, so. Yeah, I mean, there's only a couple of the big banks, you know, trust, like, you know,
[01:58:17.410 --> 01:58:23.970]  if I want my fans, like, I just go to CSI directly, you know, like, be honest, just go directly through
[01:58:23.970 --> 01:58:31.650]  them. Norstar Genetics, with geneticsupply.com. They're another, they're straight up people.
[01:58:32.290 --> 01:58:39.330]  Awesome, amazing service. Also, Speakeasy Seedbank, you know, that's another, like, bigger
[01:58:39.330 --> 01:58:45.810]  online place that, you know, you're going to get your stuff. I trust them. I've had personal,
[01:58:45.810 --> 01:58:51.570]  multiple conversations with them. They're good folks as well. You know, but other, like we were
[01:58:51.570 --> 01:58:57.170]  saying, like, to be honest, in the last three years, I've gotten better fire from either people
[01:58:57.170 --> 01:59:01.810]  I've met online, that I kind of look and see what they're doing and want to make a trade or,
[01:59:03.330 --> 01:59:08.290]  you know, or, you know, members of the collective, you know, that'll be like, oh, hey,
[01:59:08.290 --> 01:59:17.810]  this is a secret project I worked on. You know, so, yeah. And like we talked about earlier,
[01:59:17.810 --> 01:59:22.130]  you know, if you find out a bunch of people are in your state and your county or whatever,
[01:59:22.130 --> 01:59:29.890]  I get it's a big place. America's huge, but, you know, trade stuff, meet up, you know, get together,
[01:59:29.890 --> 01:59:37.890]  talk about this, because like, it seems like that's the old way of things is that, you know,
[01:59:38.450 --> 01:59:47.250]  it's a plant, share it, grow it, get it out there, talk about it with your friends, your peers,
[01:59:48.210 --> 01:59:51.250]  talk about it with strangers, at least strangers you can trust.
[01:59:53.810 --> 01:59:56.930]  I buy all my seeds on Instagram. Well, you know what?
[01:59:57.810 --> 01:59:58.370]  So do I.
[02:00:00.530 --> 02:00:03.890]  You probably got some fire, dude. You know, that's, I mean, seriously.
[02:00:06.130 --> 02:00:09.330]  You gotta start somewhere. I mean, but yeah, we'll do those.
[02:00:09.970 --> 02:00:16.610]  I agree. Cuts is another thing I've seen. I've seen some shady shit, you know, on IG,
[02:00:17.410 --> 02:00:22.690]  on the forums, you know, people wanting $300 a cut.
[02:00:24.450 --> 02:00:30.850]  Unrooted cuts for $300 I've seen. Yeah, no, you know, there's a couple cats out
[02:00:30.850 --> 02:00:39.410]  there that, you know, have legit stuff. We'll back this shit up if, you know, you don't get it and
[02:00:39.410 --> 02:00:48.530]  you can rely on the integrity of that it is what it is. But, yeah.
[02:00:48.530 --> 02:00:55.250]  It's fun breeding. Breeding is fun. And there's so many different directions. There's so many
[02:00:55.250 --> 02:01:00.450]  things you could do. You could slap this onto this and slaps and slaps and this and slap more of that.
[02:01:01.010 --> 02:01:04.450]  But, you know, there's some people out there who are breeding with intent.
[02:01:04.450 --> 02:01:11.810]  And those are the people that I try to, I mean, one of the reasons I started producing seeds is,
[02:01:12.370 --> 02:01:19.490]  you know, for myself 20 years ago, is because I've not been having good experience. I mean,
[02:01:19.490 --> 02:01:24.130]  there hardly anything was available back then. And if you get them, they were really like,
[02:01:24.130 --> 02:01:31.250]  what the hell am I going to do with this thing? You know, so it took, and for a long time,
[02:01:31.250 --> 02:01:37.970]  for 10 years, it's like, let's say like from the late 90s all the way to like 2000s, anything that
[02:01:37.970 --> 02:01:45.650]  you would find on the internet or in the inside of the dispensaries, the medical dispensaries in
[02:01:45.650 --> 02:01:52.690]  those days, it would not be, it's like people wouldn't, it was hard to even get a good mail back
[02:01:52.690 --> 02:02:00.610]  then. You know, like some of the first seeds that became available 10, 12, 13, 14 in the year 2010,
[02:02:01.570 --> 02:02:06.770]  was like, crack it, start licking with the tangies. This one start licking with that. And then, you
[02:02:06.770 --> 02:02:12.530]  know, winning cups in Amsterdam. And then I'm like, okay, well, I bought some flower at the store.
[02:02:13.090 --> 02:02:18.530]  That tangy turf is amazing. I could add that to some purple, some cherry pie, to some OG,
[02:02:18.530 --> 02:02:22.850]  like, you know, forbidden fruit. And the other thing I made them years and years before forbidden
[02:02:22.850 --> 02:02:28.930]  fruit was a thing. But, you know, because you're interested in these things and then you go and
[02:02:28.930 --> 02:02:33.250]  you drive all over the place, you have your family in Los Angeles, grabbing packs from whatever is
[02:02:33.250 --> 02:02:37.890]  available down there, you buy four or five packs of tangy and you run through them and you're
[02:02:37.890 --> 02:02:43.410]  totally disappointed. You know, you do, you run through another pack, select another mail, do
[02:02:43.410 --> 02:02:48.450]  another breed, you're totally disappointed. You have friends who go to the parade who are in
[02:02:48.450 --> 02:02:55.970]  in Amsterdam at the High Times Cannabis Cup Parade and they're issuing out tangy freebies over there.
[02:02:55.970 --> 02:03:02.050]  Got some of those, tried those. I'm like, no, this is not, this is just a riney orange tree, not really
[02:03:02.050 --> 02:03:09.010]  orange sickle, you know. So it took a long time. And so there's a lot of big companies out there too
[02:03:09.010 --> 02:03:13.570]  that I have been through their stuff, looked through their stuff and it just leads me to the
[02:03:13.570 --> 02:03:21.810]  direction of like, okay, finding one good one, you know, one good male, one good plant, one good
[02:03:21.810 --> 02:03:27.170]  source and start from there and start creating your own. But now, I mean, there's so much more
[02:03:27.170 --> 02:03:31.970]  available and there's a lot of trash out there too. It's a lot of stuff that, you know, it's hard for me
[02:03:31.970 --> 02:03:38.050]  to just grab like a Tropicana cross by so-and-so male and just feel great about putting that into
[02:03:38.050 --> 02:03:46.050]  a project, you know, or buy some super polyhybrid stuff and just pushing it into a project.
[02:03:46.690 --> 02:03:53.970]  It just doesn't feel, you know, you probably have to look at a hundred seeds like what most people
[02:03:53.970 --> 02:03:57.490]  were saying in the past. People talk about, you're going to look at a hundred seeds to test your
[02:03:57.490 --> 02:04:02.930]  appreciation. Well, then yeah, if you're working with those super polyhybrids, smash slaps together,
[02:04:02.930 --> 02:04:07.730]  then you're going to have to look through a hundred seeds because, you know, it's all over the damn
[02:04:07.730 --> 02:04:13.570]  place. So that's my experience with it. And that's why I started making my, started doing it with intent.
[02:04:13.570 --> 02:04:18.290]  I want this, let me, how am I going to get this? Okay, there's these different strategies of breeding,
[02:04:18.290 --> 02:04:23.010]  there's out crossing and crossing, back crossing, you know, figure out how you're going to do it
[02:04:23.010 --> 02:04:27.410]  together and what these things mean and how you're going to accomplish your goals. But set goals in
[02:04:27.410 --> 02:04:32.370]  breeding, not just like girlfriend, boyfriend, you guys wonder what kind of kids you guys are
[02:04:32.370 --> 02:04:38.850]  going to make. At least have some intent of what your project will be. I mean, I do a lot of that
[02:04:38.930 --> 02:04:45.970]  slap stuff together too, but you know, those are just things on the side that, you know, because
[02:04:45.970 --> 02:04:51.490]  most and every breeding has a goal and then you could throw in other little things to say slap it
[02:04:51.490 --> 02:04:56.370]  on the side and see what happens with that. But, you know, when you set up a breeding, you try to
[02:04:56.370 --> 02:05:05.090]  have goals. This is very important. Totally. Well, that should be a topic too, I think that you just
[02:05:05.090 --> 02:05:11.730]  touched on for a future episode is we should talk about males and show pictures, you know, some
[02:05:11.730 --> 02:05:23.010]  pics of like male selections, the elusive male in breeding today. Yeah. So, it's an important topic
[02:05:23.010 --> 02:05:29.650]  because most people would ask, you know, I'm trying to get this from this train, what, which one of
[02:05:29.650 --> 02:05:35.890]  these equations can I plug it into? And I'm like, well, if you don't know what you've got, none of
[02:05:35.890 --> 02:05:42.690]  these equations is going to, all of these equations are going to equal zero. You know, so the most
[02:05:42.690 --> 02:05:48.290]  important thing is to kind of know what is in those pools. If they're super polyhybrid, try to
[02:05:48.290 --> 02:05:53.490]  understand them. You got Urkel, you got Cookies, you got Gelato, you got Tanji, you got all of these, you
[02:05:53.490 --> 02:06:00.290]  try to understand what's in them, you know, because they're not, they're not failure or, you know, bred
[02:06:00.290 --> 02:06:08.290]  to be homozygous for certain traits. You're dealing with a lot of super complex F1s, you know, so, you
[02:06:08.290 --> 02:06:14.850]  know, kind of if you understand the makeup, that's why it's good to be connected to the breeders and
[02:06:14.850 --> 02:06:19.810]  the sources, because if you understand the makeup of what's inside of these pools, when they start
[02:06:19.810 --> 02:06:24.850]  spitting it out in the progeny, you could understand, okay, that's the Urkel, that's where I could see,
[02:06:25.650 --> 02:06:33.490]  you know, 10% is having, you know, recessive from grandparents or this or that, you never know.
[02:06:33.490 --> 02:06:38.770]  It's good to know what's inside of those things when you breed. A lot of people don't know, they have
[02:06:38.770 --> 02:06:43.410]  no experience with plants at all, so when they grab a Gelato, they had no experience with Cookies,
[02:06:43.410 --> 02:06:48.930]  they had no experience with Sherb, they had no experience with Burmese, so it's like, you know,
[02:06:48.930 --> 02:06:53.650]  when these things start pushing out, at least, you know, some of these Gelatos, they breed, you know,
[02:06:53.650 --> 02:06:58.450]  homo, they're very homozygous for certain things, so that's the good thing about it, but there's a
[02:06:58.450 --> 02:07:04.610]  lot of them out there that doesn't really do that, so if you understand the makeup, when it starts
[02:07:04.610 --> 02:07:10.770]  printing it out for you, then you could understand where, what is what, how much, or if it's something
[02:07:11.650 --> 02:07:18.370]  that you want to move forward with. Is it passing the trait that you like? Is it dominant
[02:07:18.370 --> 02:07:22.610]  in the progeny? Is it, because if it's not dominant, then more than likely,
[02:07:24.530 --> 02:07:29.650]  if you choose to breed from that progeny, the offsprings are in turn probably not going to be
[02:07:29.650 --> 02:07:37.810]  dominant as well, that you were looking for, so it's just ideas of how I approach my
[02:07:37.810 --> 02:07:43.250]  breeding situation, even if I get a plant from someone who has in it, and that's the reason why
[02:07:43.250 --> 02:07:49.490]  you gave me the blackberry, I threw it away the first time, because I had no idea what it was.
[02:07:49.490 --> 02:07:54.770]  I was like, okay, it's just a modern strain, Jamal said it's just a modern strain. After I
[02:07:54.770 --> 02:07:59.250]  smoked it, then I'm like, oh, that has some tangy, oh, that has some unique stuff in it, tell me about it,
[02:08:00.610 --> 02:08:06.130]  and then it became interesting, you know, and then, okay, well, let me look at that, let me try
[02:08:06.130 --> 02:08:12.210]  breeding that, and then I can see, you know, if I see cherry punch, if I see more of the tangy coming
[02:08:12.210 --> 02:08:20.850]  up, and yeah, so, you know, people say you can't predict, but in some sense, if you understand
[02:08:20.850 --> 02:08:25.970]  the makeup of these things, you can have, you can't predict, but you could at least identify what
[02:08:25.970 --> 02:08:32.610]  you're looking at, when the time is right, you know, and the equation thing is like, you know, an equation
[02:08:32.610 --> 02:08:37.410]  is like, that's the best equation you have, you could have is having knowledge on the makeup of what
[02:08:37.410 --> 02:08:41.890]  you're working with, and then you're going to know how to plug it in, which direction you, how you,
[02:08:41.890 --> 02:08:47.490]  what type of breeding you want to do to gain the results that you want, whether it's reverse, or
[02:08:47.490 --> 02:08:52.930]  whether it's field you're breeding, or crossing, you know, different ways to achieve your goal, but
[02:08:53.570 --> 02:08:59.170]  you know, they're easily attained when certain things within the gene pools are locked in, and
[02:08:59.170 --> 02:09:08.130]  you know which directions, and what equation to choose for those. Yeah, yeah, Warren, Drew, Jamal
[02:09:08.210 --> 02:09:15.730]  has worked with some great hazes in the past, with the Neville's haze, we'll be working on some more
[02:09:15.730 --> 02:09:26.290]  hazy stuff too, and to be honest, like some of grasshoppers, you know, land race crosses are
[02:09:26.290 --> 02:09:33.970]  kind of hazy and by themselves, so there's definitely the long highs there. Yeah,
[02:09:34.370 --> 02:09:40.370]  man, the best haze I've ever came across over the years, everybody rave about super silver,
[02:09:40.370 --> 02:09:46.450]  but super silver was, it was, it was passed around, it was the NL5 haze cut that was passed
[02:09:46.450 --> 02:09:51.570]  around quite a lot, and then there was another cut called the cough that was held really tight,
[02:09:52.370 --> 02:09:56.610]  and up until this day, it's held really tight, I see JJ working with it, I see
[02:09:56.610 --> 02:10:01.970]  Professor P working with it, but that was, that's the haze, that's the one we used to grow
[02:10:02.050 --> 02:10:07.090]  you know, if we could, if the cough wasn't available, then you go to super silver,
[02:10:07.810 --> 02:10:17.730]  but you know, if everybody who is super silver lovers, the cough is super silver
[02:10:19.250 --> 02:10:27.890]  and on another level, yeah, the cough is an amazing strain, I mean, yeah, people should,
[02:10:28.290 --> 02:10:33.570]  people should, haze lovers should look into the cough crosses, JJ working with it at Top Dog,
[02:10:33.570 --> 02:10:38.690]  Professor P works with it, it's one of the most amazing NL5 hazes I've came across,
[02:10:38.690 --> 02:10:42.290]  and it's still held tight, it was referred to as the Fort Collins cut,
[02:10:44.130 --> 02:10:49.090]  yeah, it's an amazing one, so for the haze lovers out there, NL5 haze,
[02:10:50.530 --> 02:10:55.650]  the cough, man, you know, 10 weeks, you call it the cough, you flower it over 12 weeks,
[02:10:56.130 --> 02:11:02.210]  it's a whole different creature, then it becomes the cough, you know, 10 weeks is NL5 haze,
[02:11:02.210 --> 02:11:07.410]  and amazing cut though, I've never seen anything like it, grows, looks like a cactus,
[02:11:08.130 --> 02:11:13.970]  looks like pineapples, like amazing, you lay that across your leg like a baby and chop through
[02:11:13.970 --> 02:11:20.530]  those, anyway, enough of that, thank you guys for having me, I appreciate you all,
[02:11:20.530 --> 02:11:27.730]  thanks to Peter, you guys have a wonderful day, yeah, you too, sign out, yeah, thank you guys,
[02:11:29.330 --> 02:11:34.690]  great show, I don't know if you guys, you guys are welcome to end it with anything you'd like to say,
[02:11:35.490 --> 02:11:46.140]  I'm good, having me again, everybody have a good one, I'm good, thanks for everybody for
[02:11:46.140 --> 02:11:59.660]  chatting, watching, you know, and yeah, we'll see you soon, later guys, peace.
