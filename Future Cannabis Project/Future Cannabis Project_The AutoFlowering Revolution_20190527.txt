[00:00.000 --> 00:09.810]  So let's talk about auto flowering.
[00:09.810 --> 00:10.810]  Sure.
[00:10.810 --> 00:11.810]  Give me a history lesson.
[00:11.810 --> 00:16.610]  Okay, well, let me just, the reason why I'm talking about it is because I've written a
[00:16.610 --> 00:23.050]  book not for you and not for most of the people that listen to this podcast, but for your
[00:23.050 --> 00:29.450]  mother or your aunt and uncle, because I'm convinced that auto flowering cannabis is
[00:29.450 --> 00:31.890]  the next tomato.
[00:31.890 --> 00:36.770]  Once or twice in a lifetime as a garden writer, because that's what I do in a different life.
[00:36.770 --> 00:42.610]  As a garden writer, I can tell you that once or twice in a lifetime, a new plant is introduced.
[00:42.610 --> 00:49.290]  The last time it happened that you might remember that I certainly remember is the snap pea.
[00:49.290 --> 00:52.690]  When the sugar snap peas came out, oh my God, people went nuts.
[00:52.690 --> 00:55.730]  It was a brand new plant nobody had ever seen.
[00:55.730 --> 00:57.390]  So people went nuts.
[00:57.390 --> 01:01.690]  I'm convinced that auto flowering cannabis is the next tomato.
[01:01.690 --> 01:04.490]  It's a snap pea in terms of a new introduction.
[01:04.490 --> 01:08.610]  And the reason why I say that is there are a couple of reasons.
[01:08.610 --> 01:14.930]  The first is that these plants, which most people have never heard of, these plants are
[01:14.930 --> 01:22.690]  a normal size plant, unlike sativa and indica, which can be anywhere from eight to 15 feet
[01:22.690 --> 01:23.690]  tall.
[01:23.690 --> 01:29.690]  These plants are anywhere from 18 inches to maybe four feet.
[01:29.690 --> 01:31.370]  It's like shrubs.
[01:31.370 --> 01:34.690]  They're shrubs at the best, but they're smaller.
[01:34.690 --> 01:38.570]  They grow in pots as well as outdoors in the soil.
[01:38.570 --> 01:40.530]  You can grow them indoors or outdoors.
[01:40.530 --> 01:45.770]  The reason why they're called auto flower is because they don't have a photo period,
[01:45.770 --> 01:48.370]  which makes all the difference in the world.
[01:48.370 --> 01:56.730]  They are a cross between a sativa or an indica, or sativa and indica, and a rudialis.
[01:56.730 --> 02:01.210]  These were plants that were discovered in the early 1900s in Russia.
[02:02.050 --> 02:07.210]  They were escaped from plantations where they were growing hemp, and evolution created a
[02:07.210 --> 02:13.370]  situation where they went from seed to flower without a photo period, only based on genetics.
[02:13.370 --> 02:18.330]  Is there any other plant that auto flowers like that without using the sun to tell it
[02:18.330 --> 02:19.330]  what to do?
[02:19.330 --> 02:20.330]  Oh, certainly.
[02:20.330 --> 02:21.330]  Yeah, there are any number of them.
[02:21.330 --> 02:22.330]  You know, grass, I mean, lawns.
[02:22.330 --> 02:24.450]  There are any number of plants that are auto flower plants.
[02:24.450 --> 02:30.850]  Now, the key thing about this is that if you live in the northern hemisphere, even if you
[02:30.850 --> 02:36.490]  live on the equator, that 12-hour darkness plus is a problem.
[02:36.490 --> 02:40.930]  We get 12 hours in Anchorage, Alaska right when the frost hits, so we're never going
[02:40.930 --> 02:42.930]  to get a plant that flowers.
[02:42.930 --> 02:50.130]  The plants that we are all using today have Afghani as a basis.
[02:50.130 --> 02:53.850]  Somebody went over there and got this plant, not knowing really what it was, what it was
[02:53.850 --> 02:54.850]  for.
[02:54.850 --> 03:00.450]  It turns out these things take six, seven, eight months from seed to harvest.
[03:01.050 --> 03:07.290]  What we have in auto flowers is the ability to grow a plant from seed to harvest in seven
[03:07.290 --> 03:09.290]  to nine weeks.
[03:09.290 --> 03:18.610]  Now, when they were first commercialized in 2002 or 2003 with a low rider, they were crappy
[03:18.610 --> 03:19.610]  plants.
[03:19.610 --> 03:20.610]  They were small.
[03:20.610 --> 03:24.530]  The yield was terrible.
[03:24.530 --> 03:26.330]  The strength wasn't all that good.
[03:26.330 --> 03:28.930]  So we're talking the early commercial auto flower?
[03:29.410 --> 03:31.010]  It was awful.
[03:31.010 --> 03:34.650]  And so as a consequence, if you started to look at them and breed them and fool around
[03:34.650 --> 03:35.850]  with them, people laughed at you.
[03:35.850 --> 03:41.850]  If you were on one of the internet websites, they threw you off basically.
[03:41.850 --> 03:47.250]  So somebody started auto flower net, which people ought to go take a look at today.
[03:47.250 --> 03:53.250]  The science, because these things can be bred so quickly, advanced exponentially.
[03:53.570 --> 03:58.370]  Around 2008, 9, 10, the strength started to get better.
[03:58.370 --> 04:00.170]  The quality was phenomenal.
[04:00.170 --> 04:02.610]  The size of the plants changed.
[04:02.610 --> 04:07.730]  And I would say today we are at the point where they need to be.
[04:07.730 --> 04:08.730]  So what are some of the improvements?
[04:08.730 --> 04:14.130]  Like if you look at the best auto flowering plants today versus 20 years ago, what's better
[04:14.130 --> 04:15.130]  now?
[04:15.130 --> 04:20.730]  Well, depending on what your perspective is, you can either breed in CBD, et cetera, et
[04:21.730 --> 04:22.730]  cetera.
[04:22.730 --> 04:29.090]  The lack of powdery mildew has been, you know, stuff has been bred out and bred in to make
[04:29.090 --> 04:36.450]  these a plant which your mother would grow in her house or on her condo deck.
[04:36.450 --> 04:41.650]  It is such an easy plant to grow that if you add fertilizer to it, you're probably causing
[04:41.650 --> 04:43.130]  a problem.
[04:43.130 --> 04:47.930]  These are plants that grow so quickly that when an insect hits it, very often what happens
[04:48.690 --> 04:54.090]  is the life phase of the plant is gone that the insect requires.
[04:54.090 --> 04:55.090]  Holy crow.
[04:55.090 --> 05:01.810]  So the whole idea of growing these plants has gone from complicated, you know, you had
[05:01.810 --> 05:06.650]  to have a degree in chemistry, you had to know about hydroponics, blah, blah, blah,
[05:06.650 --> 05:08.850]  to the most simple, easy.
[05:08.850 --> 05:14.170]  You go buy a bag of soil, you stick it in a five gallon pot, you put the seed in the
[05:14.170 --> 05:19.090]  pot, you don't even transplant it because they don't like to be transplanted and bingo,
[05:19.090 --> 05:25.730]  seven to nine weeks later you have a usable, and I mean a usable cannabis crop.
[05:25.730 --> 05:26.970]  How large are these plants?
[05:26.970 --> 05:30.850]  Well these plants can be anywhere from this big, you know, to about four feet, four and
[05:30.850 --> 05:31.850]  a half feet.
[05:31.850 --> 05:32.850]  What sort of yield?
[05:32.850 --> 05:33.850]  What are the flowers like?
[05:33.850 --> 05:40.450]  I saw a yield the other day, 80 grams on a cola and there were about eight colas on the
[05:40.450 --> 05:41.450]  plant.
[05:41.450 --> 05:42.450]  So the yield is phenomenal.
[05:42.730 --> 05:47.610]  If you just pop onto Instagram and look up auto flowering cannabis, you will be phenomenally
[05:47.610 --> 05:48.850]  surprised.
[05:48.850 --> 05:50.810]  This is the next tomato.
[05:50.810 --> 05:55.650]  Now from a commercial grower's perspective, in places like Oregon, they're beginning to
[05:55.650 --> 06:00.750]  use these because the advantages are phenomenal.
[06:00.750 --> 06:05.730]  First of all, you get a uniform size plant, very important.
[06:05.730 --> 06:09.570]  Second of all, you don't have to worry about the photo period.
[06:09.570 --> 06:14.770]  What that means is that if you are growing photo period plants, you can put these plants
[06:14.770 --> 06:20.070]  in between your photo period plants, whether you're in a veg stage or a flower stage and
[06:20.070 --> 06:21.810]  still get results.
[06:21.810 --> 06:24.410]  Absolutely spectacular.
[06:24.410 --> 06:32.890]  The ability to breed these things is wonderful because they are so quick and, you know, the
[06:32.890 --> 06:38.210]  fact that you can turn over any number of crops means that if you're growing outdoors,
[06:38.210 --> 06:44.930]  you can put one in the ground now and probably get two more crops in before a frost hits
[06:44.930 --> 06:48.050]  sometime in October.
[06:48.050 --> 06:50.370]  Just spectacular plants, really spectacular.
[06:50.370 --> 06:57.090]  Are there any specific breeders that you've talked to and kind of picked their brains?
[06:57.090 --> 06:58.090]  Sure.
[06:58.090 --> 07:01.730]  Who's a breeder who's doing some interesting stuff?
[07:01.730 --> 07:10.250]  Well, you know, I would say on a general level for the home grower, the tomato grower,
[07:10.250 --> 07:16.170]  I would take a look at Mephesto seeds, Mephesto genetics, phenomenal.
[07:16.170 --> 07:22.450]  In Oregon, there's a company called New Breed Seeds, which is a sister company to Territorial
[07:22.450 --> 07:28.090]  Seeds, which already sells tomato plants, so we're really in a great spot.
[07:28.090 --> 07:29.850]  You know, it's worth looking around.
[07:29.970 --> 07:33.970]  Are they able to introduce existing genetics into these new plants?
[07:33.970 --> 07:42.050]  Yes, and they're able to work on the genetics so that we can backtrace to some of the land
[07:42.050 --> 07:43.050]  races.
[07:43.050 --> 07:45.370]  This is really an exciting tool that we've developed.
[07:45.370 --> 07:50.690]  So it's not necessarily a threat to breeders who've been...
[07:50.690 --> 07:52.250]  No, absolutely not.
[07:52.250 --> 07:53.250]  It's a tool.
[07:53.250 --> 07:58.610]  It's a tool because you can breed these with regular cannabis, take some of the advantages
[07:58.610 --> 08:03.650]  of these, add in the advantages of regular cannabis, the bigger cousins, as I like to
[08:03.650 --> 08:04.650]  say.
[08:04.650 --> 08:11.330]  Transitioning from my mom to the hardcore commercial cultivator selling flower into
[08:11.330 --> 08:16.010]  the California market, the Oregon market, the Washington state market, what are those
[08:16.010 --> 08:21.650]  growers, like when you meet people all the time, what are their thoughts on adding auto
[08:21.650 --> 08:26.370]  flowering to their mix of light depth?
[08:26.370 --> 08:27.370]  Can I add on to that?
[08:27.370 --> 08:28.370]  Sure.
[08:29.130 --> 08:33.130]  I'm a commercial cultivator who says appellation is a really important part of my future survival.
[08:33.130 --> 08:34.130]  Sure.
[08:34.130 --> 08:36.930]  Well, let's work with the appellation part first.
[08:36.930 --> 08:43.050]  I mean, appellation has to do with what I call the three-legged stool.
[08:43.050 --> 08:47.650]  Genetics, light, what's the light in your area?
[08:47.650 --> 08:49.850]  And the soil, the microbes in the soil.
[08:49.850 --> 08:52.090]  Obviously, I would be a microbe guy.
[08:52.090 --> 08:58.970]  And what gives the plant terroir, I think, are the microbes in the soil and the light
[08:58.970 --> 09:05.290]  because the light has such an incredible impact on the microbes in the soil, which make available
[09:05.290 --> 09:08.650]  all of the 18 nutrients that the plant needs to have.
[09:08.650 --> 09:13.250]  Now, we can put all the other crap we want in a plant.
[09:13.250 --> 09:14.330]  That's not what the plant uses.
[09:14.330 --> 09:17.610]  It uses those 17, 18 nutrients and that's it.
[09:17.610 --> 09:22.570]  And the ability to be able to have specialized microbes in your area to create that terroir.
[09:22.570 --> 09:25.730]  So it works with these plants just like any other plant.
[09:25.730 --> 09:29.210]  So it's no different than a regular cannabis plant.
[09:29.210 --> 09:38.170]  And because you can grow these in pots very easily and move them around very easily, you
[09:38.170 --> 09:41.850]  can create your own terroir to a certain degree.
[09:41.850 --> 09:42.850]  You can bring in soil.
[09:42.850 --> 09:43.850]  So that was my question.
[09:43.850 --> 09:44.850]  They can go into the ground?
[09:44.850 --> 09:45.850]  Oh, absolutely.
[09:45.850 --> 09:46.850]  And or they go into a pot?
[09:47.090 --> 09:48.090]  Absolutely.
[09:48.090 --> 09:51.090]  Because you know, Appalachian purists go, if you're in a pot, if you're not in the ground,
[09:51.090 --> 09:52.090]  you're...
[09:52.090 --> 09:55.090]  Well, if you're in a pot but you have the soil that you've taken care of...
[09:55.090 --> 09:58.810]  Well, I know, but then they go, well, then you can grow Humboldt Appalachian anywhere
[09:58.810 --> 09:59.810]  in the world.
[09:59.810 --> 10:00.810]  And that's true.
[10:00.810 --> 10:01.810]  And you've got it.
[10:01.810 --> 10:02.810]  I hate to say it.
[10:02.810 --> 10:04.610]  It is true.
[10:04.610 --> 10:07.730]  But these are really spectacular plants.
[10:07.730 --> 10:09.730]  The colors, the varieties.
[10:09.730 --> 10:13.090]  Oh my God, it's unbelievable.
[10:13.090 --> 10:19.530]  And you know, the fact that you can grow a plant in a little teeny area and get a usable
[10:19.530 --> 10:20.970]  harvest, wow.
[10:20.970 --> 10:25.090]  So I think the future of cannabis is going to be auto flower.
[10:25.090 --> 10:29.090]  I think we're going to end up in a situation once it's fully legalized, where you're going
[10:29.090 --> 10:34.770]  to be able to walk into your, you know, your Best Buy at Christmas time and they're going
[10:34.770 --> 10:38.010]  to be little Christmas trees, auto flower cannabis.
[10:38.010 --> 10:41.250]  But Easter, it's going to, you know, it's going to have the same tree, but it'll have
[10:41.250 --> 10:44.570]  that, you know, silly little green stuff.
[10:44.570 --> 10:48.450]  Well, you know, I said the same thing about legalization.
[10:48.450 --> 10:51.610]  It took a while, but I think we're there.
[10:51.610 --> 10:57.610]  You know, I predicted pretty well the microbe wave.
[10:57.610 --> 10:59.370]  This is not a great book.
[10:59.370 --> 11:01.450]  It's just that it hit the wave at the right time.
[11:01.450 --> 11:05.130]  I think I predicted pretty well the mycorrhizal wave.
[11:05.250 --> 11:09.010]  I'm telling you, I got a real feeling about this auto flowering wave.
[11:09.010 --> 11:10.510]  This is it.
[11:10.510 --> 11:14.530]  So when you go to a dispensary, very often they sell the seeds.
[11:14.530 --> 11:18.190]  The seeds do not contain THC in them, obviously.
[11:18.190 --> 11:21.090]  So you should be able to buy them in the mail.
[11:21.090 --> 11:24.690]  You know, unless you live in a place like Alaska where they've made seeds part of the
[11:24.690 --> 11:25.690]  plant.
[11:25.690 --> 11:26.690]  So you need to be a breeder.
[11:26.690 --> 11:29.410]  You don't need to be a breeder.
[11:29.410 --> 11:30.810]  But you can pick these seeds up.
[11:30.810 --> 11:33.330]  They're very, very available.
[11:33.530 --> 11:37.090]  For home grow use, that'll be like auto flowering.
[11:37.090 --> 11:39.570]  It sounds like it's going to have tremendous home growth.
[11:39.570 --> 11:40.570]  That's right.
[11:40.570 --> 11:43.650]  You're going to be able to go to a seed rack, and when you buy your tomato plant and your
[11:43.650 --> 11:48.010]  celery or your carrots, there's going to be four or five different kinds of auto flowering.
[11:48.010 --> 11:51.170]  Is it open source science and technology?
[11:51.170 --> 11:52.170]  Yes.
[11:52.170 --> 11:53.170]  Yes.
[11:53.170 --> 11:54.170]  No secrets.
[11:54.170 --> 11:55.450]  Rudy Allis plants are available.
[11:55.450 --> 11:57.930]  People can breed their own.
[11:57.930 --> 12:02.410]  You know, so far it looks like a very clean entry into the industry.
[12:02.490 --> 12:05.690]  I think it's going to be really helpful for everybody.
[12:05.690 --> 12:08.010]  But we have improved everything we've done.
[12:08.010 --> 12:11.730]  You know, I mean, we've introduced CBD or brought it back.
[12:11.730 --> 12:15.490]  We've introduced, you know, all sorts of things.
[12:15.490 --> 12:19.210]  This is just another tool in the chest.
[12:19.210 --> 12:20.210]  And really an important one.
