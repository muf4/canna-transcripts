[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  Let's see
[00:05.020 --> 00:08.580]  Brian you ready cuz it's gonna go live in about four up. It's live
[00:12.860 --> 00:16.220]  You guys you guys are gonna be intimate in this conversation
[00:17.980 --> 00:19.980]  When Brian squeezes in there, so
[00:25.580 --> 00:29.900]  Yeah, well we're live so welcome everyone and
[00:29.900 --> 00:34.380]  One and I Brian you want me to flip it to you and you can just introduce these guys and
[00:35.020 --> 00:38.860]  Yeah, so we're just here live in Denver. Just kind of hanging out tonight
[00:38.860 --> 00:42.940]  I reached out to these guys because I feel like there's certain people that need a voice
[00:42.940 --> 00:46.300]  And one of those guys I feel like is Greg here with genome alchemy
[00:47.180 --> 00:50.700]  I'm excited for your audience to hear what he has to say
[00:50.700 --> 00:56.460]  And then I feel like everybody kind of knows who this gentleman is. They can see so I feel like we'll have a
[00:57.580 --> 00:59.020]  very
[00:59.420 --> 01:01.180]  Very complex
[01:01.180 --> 01:04.860]  Conversation tonight about what it really takes to start from living soil seed
[01:05.340 --> 01:11.780]  Cultivate that into a living soil flower material and then pass that canvas if you will onto a guy like a tea
[01:11.820 --> 01:15.060]  Where he takes it on as his own artwork
[01:15.620 --> 01:17.620]  So that's what we're going to discuss today. I
[01:18.660 --> 01:20.660]  Like it. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah
[01:21.980 --> 01:28.380]  Right on y'all. Well, I'm gonna introduce my boy genome alchemy over here first. I'm just gonna cut right into it
[01:28.460 --> 01:35.100]  Y'all don't mind but this dude I've known him for almost 20 years now. I mean 20 years. Yeah much here
[01:35.820 --> 01:40.660]  We've lived together and we still love each other which is kind of crazy. I think
[01:43.540 --> 01:45.220]  This dude crushes
[01:45.220 --> 01:50.540]  I've known him for a long time and he's always been my grower my breeder, you know
[01:50.540 --> 01:53.660]  When I kind of trod throughout the world, you know, I'm awesome
[01:54.180 --> 01:56.720]  Honestly, I'm constantly talking about my breeder day
[01:57.440 --> 02:02.360]  So they got genome alchemy right here this man's been doing it for a long time
[02:02.360 --> 02:05.080]  So why don't you tell them what you've been doing with breeding? Yeah, right
[02:05.080 --> 02:09.360]  I mean much love brother. We definitely definitely been in the game a long time
[02:09.360 --> 02:14.200]  You know, it's good to see you know, we're still still doing the thing, you know, I
[02:15.200 --> 02:17.880]  You know started breeding in 2012
[02:18.820 --> 02:21.260]  Really just no, I love her cannabis is
[02:21.960 --> 02:23.800]  beyond
[02:23.800 --> 02:30.320]  You know anything else so it's what I've decided to do in my life for you know going on 20 years so for
[02:31.120 --> 02:38.640]  The last eight or nine years. I've been playing around with you know, recombining genes and you know doing the genome alchemy thing
[02:39.360 --> 02:41.360]  really playing around
[02:41.800 --> 02:42.940]  with
[02:42.940 --> 02:47.960]  Like I was saying earlier non-hype type stuff, but you know really just novel
[02:48.760 --> 02:56.500]  New and interesting strains, you know, I like to mess around land races like to bring in you know, kind of
[02:57.480 --> 03:02.280]  Lots of different genetic diversity from all different areas, you know of the world and you know
[03:02.800 --> 03:10.060]  And the cannabis industry locally too. So all about bio regionality and you know, I'm a living soil grower. So
[03:10.760 --> 03:14.160]  Kind of beyond organic mentality. I try to breed for
[03:14.720 --> 03:21.800]  Specific locales, you know, not just you know, the next thing that's gonna hit the shelf in you know, Cali or wherever
[03:21.800 --> 03:23.800]  you know, it's
[03:24.440 --> 03:26.440]  Just kind of I
[03:26.760 --> 03:28.760]  Don't know a local
[03:29.240 --> 03:31.120]  hyperlocal focus
[03:31.120 --> 03:34.840]  You know, we're here in Colorado from Colorado. This is my home
[03:35.000 --> 03:37.920]  so I want to breed genetics that do good here and
[03:38.560 --> 03:42.160]  You know will also, you know do well in other places
[03:42.160 --> 03:44.160]  You know kind of focus on
[03:45.520 --> 03:50.640]  You know the regions that are known for cannabis, you know, Northern California, Colorado
[03:51.640 --> 03:53.640]  You know the Southwest
[03:54.640 --> 03:57.960]  Southeast, you know like I love it all, you know, so
[03:59.080 --> 04:01.080]  really trying to
[04:01.240 --> 04:07.320]  Trying to step the game up and bring something to the table that you know, no one else really has so
[04:09.520 --> 04:11.520]  From a flame like
[04:11.720 --> 04:18.560]  Do you breed for your own palate or do you breed for like and Nick how would you describe his palate?
[04:20.160 --> 04:22.520]  Like what it is he like I mean, it's
[04:23.360 --> 04:25.040]  gas all day
[04:25.040 --> 04:27.040]  my god
[04:27.800 --> 04:33.800]  You know pink house a long time ago. We were kind of the first people to bring all the real ogs
[04:34.760 --> 04:37.400]  And those you know old-school
[04:38.360 --> 04:40.360]  gas only
[04:40.560 --> 04:41.840]  Flavors
[04:41.840 --> 04:43.840]  to the Colorado scene, so
[04:44.000 --> 04:46.000]  That's my pal. It's what like smoke
[04:46.320 --> 04:50.760]  And that's really, you know what? I like to continue in my breeding projects as well
[04:50.760 --> 04:56.680]  But you know, I'm I breed for everyone, you know, I'm not just trying to pump out gas and only gas, you know
[04:56.680 --> 05:02.400]  I want to you know make things that are great for you know for washing, you know good for
[05:02.720 --> 05:10.080]  Specifically for solvents extracts, you know stuff that's specifically, you know gonna do good in a you know hydrocarbon environment
[05:10.120 --> 05:15.040]  You know stuff that you know kind of fits other people's palates beside my own, you know
[05:15.040 --> 05:18.840]  But you know, I I tend to lean towards ogs and sours
[05:19.360 --> 05:24.480]  You know last couple years of the mess around the CBD game too. So lots of CBD
[05:25.640 --> 05:26.760]  kind of
[05:26.760 --> 05:34.880]  You know non cherry bland, you know kind of out of the box type stuff for you know for the high CBD
[05:36.240 --> 05:38.000]  industry as well, so
[05:38.000 --> 05:44.700]  What's some of the stuff like nicotine and I were involved with when you first won the home growers cup
[05:44.960 --> 05:48.200]  Let's talk about those. I actually wanted to touch on that real quick
[05:50.040 --> 05:54.800]  Yes, genome alchemy has been known for gas in fact when we live together
[05:54.800 --> 06:01.040]  We grew this og 18 cut from DNA. That was you know, one of the truest to og
[06:01.560 --> 06:03.040]  from seed
[06:03.040 --> 06:05.040]  Phenotypes really out there
[06:05.960 --> 06:14.080]  Gas gas gas gas but recently and the stream that he won the home growers cup with has that gas profile
[06:14.080 --> 06:18.240]  But also has something that I always kind of recognize as anise
[06:18.720 --> 06:25.440]  It has this serious unique floral nature to it. So why don't you tell them what that stream was? It's Fantasia
[06:25.920 --> 06:28.640]  so I crossed the Kerbal Fantasy with
[06:29.320 --> 06:34.920]  Platinum Tesla the platinum Tesla male that I used was a strain I made
[06:35.960 --> 06:38.360]  probably in 2014 with
[06:39.200 --> 06:42.660]  Platinum cookies which came from dark art nursery actually
[06:43.520 --> 06:46.760]  There was a OG kush breath mutant, you know
[06:46.760 --> 06:50.280]  They call it a dark art DHN mutant was the the cut that we had a pink house
[06:50.600 --> 06:56.000]  And it was straight up OG kush breath. Like I've never seen anything that was labeled
[06:56.520 --> 07:00.240]  Something else that you know was more like OG kush breath, you know
[07:00.240 --> 07:05.080]  It was called platinum cookies, but it's not kind of platinum cookies that I see around, you know
[07:05.080 --> 07:08.700]  It's like thin or one of those others, you know, it's very unique kind of
[07:09.320 --> 07:11.680]  growth structure and flavor to it
[07:12.120 --> 07:19.480]  So I crossed that platinum cookies with overflow from archive which is face up og crossed with Colorado flow
[07:20.280 --> 07:22.400]  Not DJ shorts flow but kind of the
[07:23.440 --> 07:25.440]  Temple flow and you know
[07:25.440 --> 07:32.560]  It's it's Colorado flow if you if you bought a bag of flow in the last five years in in Colorado
[07:32.560 --> 07:34.560]  Then it's back
[07:36.640 --> 07:43.480]  You know, I I've heard one way or the other I know I didn't hunt the seeds from the pack of DJ shorts flow
[07:43.480 --> 07:48.820]  So I was just kind of it was the tune to good. I mean, it's the same strain DJ short made it, you know
[07:49.100 --> 07:51.100]  but
[07:53.540 --> 07:58.140]  So the overflow I mean everything that Fletch does with archive is incredible
[07:58.900 --> 08:00.900]  so I selected this mail out of
[08:01.580 --> 08:04.740]  Six different mails. I liked it crossed it with
[08:05.200 --> 08:07.680]  The platinum cookies and that was the planet Tesla
[08:07.740 --> 08:12.480]  So that one got a lot of love a lot of people have it on the shelves here in Colorado
[08:13.200 --> 08:18.920]  And that became kind of one of my first my own mails that I started breeding with
[08:19.840 --> 08:22.120]  and I crossed out with a purple fantasy which
[08:23.160 --> 08:28.620]  For people that know the Kerbal fantasy it is what I know as purple gas. So
[08:35.160 --> 08:38.680]  The Kerbal fantasy is one of my favorites to smoke it hit all the notes
[08:39.280 --> 08:43.340]  Of you know, he says anise I definitely get that
[08:44.840 --> 08:47.200]  So that's that became the Fantasia
[08:47.840 --> 08:52.280]  Platinum Tesla counts Kerbal fantasy and our should say Kerbal fantasy times platinum Tesla
[08:52.880 --> 08:54.000]  and
[08:54.000 --> 08:59.080]  That was you know, several phenos of that are floating around in Colorado bunch of people pop those packs
[09:00.040 --> 09:02.040]  the main one
[09:02.800 --> 09:06.320]  That I'm on the homegrowers cup with as in a few dispensaries here
[09:06.320 --> 09:11.640]  I know you can find it the herbal cure at least used to you know, a few other dispensaries and stuff, but
[09:12.680 --> 09:16.560]  you know prohibition urban and miserable, you know, the
[09:17.200 --> 09:22.000]  The cut was just incredible. So, you know, I've cited enter it everyone loved it
[09:22.000 --> 09:25.480]  you know, I don't know if it was because it was living soil grown that it just you know,
[09:25.960 --> 09:31.800]  Blew out the the jar and you know, it's good out man's literally like everyone loved it
[09:31.800 --> 09:35.020]  So I was fortunate enough to win that contest the first year they had it
[09:35.380 --> 09:38.920]  I didn't do as well the second year, but you know
[09:39.660 --> 09:41.720]  there's some technical difficulties with the
[09:42.820 --> 09:45.900]  With the entries and stuff. So, you know, it may have something to do with it
[09:45.900 --> 09:50.780]  Who knows but that Fantasia is one of my favorite. I've actually continued to line. I just
[09:51.940 --> 09:54.660]  just I'm testing the F2s right now and
[09:55.820 --> 10:00.380]  Finding some serious heat in there and I'm gonna push another generation and probably
[10:01.300 --> 10:03.300]  release those
[10:03.940 --> 10:05.940]  Beginning of 2021
[10:06.660 --> 10:08.220]  Maybe
[10:08.220 --> 10:12.500]  Spring something like that. You can be looking out for that the Fantasia's and seed form again
[10:13.780 --> 10:19.740]  So, yeah, I love it. I'll continue to work that line. No, you know everyone smokes it loves it, too
[10:22.740 --> 10:26.380]  So if people want to get seats from either ask him here on IG live
[10:26.780 --> 10:30.780]  What's the best way to do? I mean just hit me up direct. That's the best way
[10:30.860 --> 10:34.340]  You know, I'm still kind of old-school like that I do direct
[10:35.420 --> 10:41.780]  Sales, you can just hit me up on Instagram at genome alchemy. My website's under construction at the moment
[10:42.700 --> 10:48.740]  Just like nicotine having some merchant processing issues and stuff like that with with getting seeds out
[10:48.740 --> 10:52.860]  But you know I have and you know, I ship wherever
[10:54.380 --> 11:00.000]  When it comes to the comes of the beans so hit me up Instagram genome alchemy
[11:01.060 --> 11:07.420]  That would be the place to do it. You can also hit me at my email if you want Greg at genome alchemy comm
[11:08.220 --> 11:10.220]  That's a good space to
[11:10.380 --> 11:14.900]  To get seize your hands. I always update my lists and get them out to people directly
[11:15.180 --> 11:17.740]  I'd like to be getting in some seed banks here at some point
[11:18.660 --> 11:23.740]  But you know as of right now, it's just hit me up. I'll get you some seeds
[11:25.500 --> 11:27.460]  So let's kind of talk more about
[11:27.500 --> 11:30.100]  You know, why would somebody want to go with your seats?
[11:30.100 --> 11:35.060]  I mean, I feel like you know, Nick and I've been able to enjoy your flower judge your flower
[11:35.060 --> 11:41.340]  I really feel like after that day kind of put you on the map you were smiling ear to ear at least here in Denver
[11:41.820 --> 11:43.460]  and then
[11:43.460 --> 11:45.980]  Yeah, kind of go into that. I mean I
[11:46.980 --> 11:54.780]  You know, I'm a living soil grower. I thoroughly believe that you know, I can express all the genetic traits that
[11:55.540 --> 12:00.900]  Are you know are important and that the plant really has to offer in a living soil system?
[12:01.580 --> 12:03.580]  and I try to
[12:03.820 --> 12:09.540]  you know do my all my selections all my breeding and everything and you know living organic soil and
[12:10.500 --> 12:14.540]  You know people that want to pump salts or whatever everybody has got their own thing
[12:14.540 --> 12:20.540]  You know for how to grow and you know, do your own thing. It's a magic of cannabis. It's like it's brings us together
[12:20.540 --> 12:24.220]  We don't I'm not trying to preach one way or the other but I will say that
[12:25.300 --> 12:28.740]  for me living soil has been the way to
[12:29.940 --> 12:32.820]  get the expression that I want out of the
[12:33.980 --> 12:38.260]  strains that I grow on the strains that I make and I'm really catering my
[12:40.100 --> 12:43.500]  You know my breeding towards living soil growers, you know
[12:43.500 --> 12:48.380]  So, you know that you can get a pack of my seeds and you know, if you're a living soil grower
[12:48.900 --> 12:51.380]  they were made for you, you know like and
[12:52.380 --> 12:54.620]  Even if you're not, you know, I know you're gonna
[12:55.380 --> 12:56.980]  You're gonna see
[12:56.980 --> 13:03.300]  amazing genetic expression one way or the other, you know, but you know, I I will say that
[13:03.980 --> 13:10.860]  You're definitely gonna see I mean not good about talking about myself a lot, but you know, you're gonna see a lot of strains
[13:12.140 --> 13:16.720]  That you're not see anywhere else out of my out of my gear, you know stuff
[13:16.720 --> 13:21.560]  If you're looking for old-school flavors, so you're looking for you know, the new hype whatever
[13:22.400 --> 13:24.400]  I've got lots of stuff that is
[13:25.320 --> 13:28.880]  Crush on the bill, you know, like whatever yours whatever your system is
[13:28.880 --> 13:33.080]  I got something for you, you know, if you want to team is if you want it because I mean whatever
[13:33.080 --> 13:38.680]  There's it's all hybrid but you're one-stop shop. We're yeah, we just pop in in Norco
[13:38.680 --> 13:44.400]  I went out there and we did an og 18. Yeah, I was og 18 cross with og 18 cross with Jedi Kush
[13:44.400 --> 13:49.160]  So there's Obi-Wan OG that I made a long time ago, which is og 18 Carson Jedi
[13:49.800 --> 13:53.600]  I got across that with a basement cup go G 18
[13:54.360 --> 13:56.360]  You know old-school gas
[13:57.880 --> 14:02.800]  OG so those are what's going several people's gardens out there
[14:03.440 --> 14:04.640]  and
[14:04.640 --> 14:10.200]  They're crushing it looks like, you know, like they've done well for me and in all my testing and you know
[14:10.800 --> 14:16.520]  Find some dough Finos we selected two females out there. Yeah, I said put in flour and he just keeps sending me photos
[14:18.960 --> 14:20.960]  You know, so, you know, that's
[14:21.600 --> 14:27.280]  You know gas is my palate and so, you know, and I generally give people seeds. That's a lot of
[14:27.840 --> 14:30.880]  It's a lot of what people are gonna get and you know
[14:31.440 --> 14:36.840]  Working some fruit lines here soon just because a lot of people love those, you know citrus herbs or you know
[14:36.880 --> 14:41.200]  Like kind of blueberry fruity, you know, I mean you pick your flavor
[14:41.360 --> 14:46.000]  I'm trying to work on some cherry and some strawberry type stuff to that are you know
[14:46.000 --> 14:50.640]  obviously got notes of og and sour in the back because that's what I love but
[14:51.200 --> 14:56.320]  You know got the you know trying to fit the bill for everyone. It's kind of my deal
[14:56.320 --> 15:02.880]  You even got like some you were the only person that I knew for a long time and probably still to this day that has
[15:03.000 --> 15:08.880]  The four columns cost. Oh, yeah, that's one of my favorite things to breed with two man is like I just loved it
[15:08.880 --> 15:11.160]  No five days. I mean people
[15:11.680 --> 15:13.680]  Never see there's out there
[15:15.960 --> 15:22.520]  Yeah, you know so yeah the four columns got me like that's such an old-school cut I mean I'm from Colorado
[15:22.520 --> 15:24.520]  so I grew up smoking that weed and
[15:24.600 --> 15:29.840]  You know, it was always something that I just had to have my garden and I still have my garden, you know
[15:30.080 --> 15:35.600]  15 years later. It's like it's a staple, you know, like it crushes you like we were
[15:36.000 --> 15:43.360]  Pretty tells what we're taking to an app at least. Yeah. Yeah. I mean it's it's definitely a crusher when it comes to yields
[15:43.360 --> 15:47.560]  And it's just got that old-school flavor, you know, it's not like anything else. I see on the shelf
[15:48.200 --> 15:52.280]  Anywhere, you know, so that's why I keep in the stable, you know
[15:52.440 --> 15:58.680]  Got that SFV and I got four columns cough and those are like the two that have never left my stable
[15:59.840 --> 16:02.560]  You know as far as that goes, so, you know
[16:03.120 --> 16:04.800]  I
[16:04.800 --> 16:07.280]  You know try to keep it old-school and you know
[16:07.280 --> 16:13.440]  Make the new shit for for you know, all the people that want something a little different
[16:13.440 --> 16:19.600]  You know, and you know, obviously trying to work on some some stuff to man trying to work on breeding
[16:19.600 --> 16:23.800]  You know a lot of my stuff washes well, but a lot of stuff doesn't does much better and hydrocarbon
[16:24.000 --> 16:28.840]  What was that that that's what I was gonna actually ask because you had mentioned hydrocarbon early on
[16:29.400 --> 16:35.280]  What what are they looking for and and you know in relation to what like Nick
[16:36.200 --> 16:38.200]  Washing would look for. I
[16:38.720 --> 16:42.880]  Think that's that's a good question for Nick. Well, you know, I'm not necessarily
[16:42.960 --> 16:50.200]  you know the the expert on what they are looking for but what we are looking for and we were actually talking about this is
[16:51.400 --> 16:52.960]  trichome density
[16:52.960 --> 16:56.560]  We're looking for something that doesn't have a super small stock
[16:56.560 --> 17:00.240]  but we're not all we're also not looking for something that has a really long stock and
[17:00.720 --> 17:04.040]  Things that we're noticing is like the OG's have a really small stock
[17:04.080 --> 17:11.040]  The blue dreams and hazes have a really long stock and so kind of those two variables don't really wash the best
[17:11.080 --> 17:18.120]  But when you find something that has trichome density that has a really thin waxy cuticle. It's also something that we look for
[17:18.840 --> 17:24.840]  And that has the terpene that we're really after and that's that's the washer right there
[17:25.320 --> 17:31.880]  Yeah, I mean in high terpenes, you know, you're gonna get it's just shown over and over living soils gonna pump terpenes
[17:32.680 --> 17:39.000]  And you know a lot of people that you know, either side of the extract game, you know
[17:39.000 --> 17:42.120]  You're gonna see higher terpene loads and you know
[17:43.040 --> 17:44.800]  expression with you know
[17:44.800 --> 17:50.600]  Living soil, you know, honestly, I've heard a lot of hash makers that are like outdoor
[17:51.120 --> 17:53.120]  Flower just you know sun-grown
[17:54.000 --> 18:00.000]  Or greenhouse grown but you know under the Sun specifically is gonna you know have serious terpene expression
[18:00.600 --> 18:07.440]  And that's what I think gonna be good, you know, whether you're hydrocarbon or solvency, you know
[18:07.440 --> 18:10.280]  But trichome structure definitely has a lot to do with it
[18:10.920 --> 18:13.200]  and you know, obviously the
[18:13.920 --> 18:15.520]  kind of
[18:15.520 --> 18:17.520]  the way that the Terps
[18:18.280 --> 18:25.280]  Really come out like in a mechanical extraction like in water or you know hydrocarbons they definitely
[18:25.600 --> 18:29.960]  It's different, you know and certain strains. They'll do better than others
[18:30.840 --> 18:35.680]  You know, everyone loves rosin and you know, so I'm kind of trying to push that
[18:36.640 --> 18:39.640]  You know side of things a little bit. I feel like
[18:40.480 --> 18:46.600]  Most people can do good in with a BHO extraction or something kind of across the board
[18:46.760 --> 18:50.840]  but solvency is a little different with you know, being able to
[18:51.640 --> 18:53.640]  get the high yields and
[18:54.760 --> 19:00.760]  Retain, you know kind of the the terpene profile that the flower has, you know, it's very specific
[19:01.520 --> 19:07.000]  Kind of structure of the trichome and then you know that comes from the genetics
[19:07.000 --> 19:12.680]  so and grow environment to you know, like there's a lot of a lot of things to do with VPD and
[19:13.320 --> 19:20.320]  You know kind of your grow room environment that'll that'll dictate the way your your trichome density and you know
[19:21.720 --> 19:25.960]  Trichome formation, you know, yeah, and that is and we were even talking about the nutrients
[19:25.960 --> 19:32.000]  You know if you're running a super salt heavy or carb heavy formulation bottle of nutrient formulation
[19:32.200 --> 19:32.880]  You know
[19:32.880 --> 19:37.880]  That's basically gonna create a lot more wax on the outside of your dry gum and less oil on the inside
[19:38.200 --> 19:42.040]  Waxes are lighter than oils waxes don't have as many terpenes as oils
[19:42.040 --> 19:46.200]  And so overall our yields are gonna suffer the quality is gonna suffer
[19:46.840 --> 19:49.160]  And it's really just not going to be viable. So
[19:49.920 --> 19:55.280]  If you are going that route of utilizing salt formations, you know AG salts
[19:56.600 --> 20:03.240]  Bottle nutrients and things of that nature just make sure you're flushing it out completely because when you're pumping it in there
[20:04.040 --> 20:07.200]  We're seeing it on the extraction side and it just doesn't work
[20:08.200 --> 20:12.320]  Also another reason why we really promote living soil you don't have to worry about that, you know
[20:12.920 --> 20:14.920]  It's gonna show the true
[20:15.520 --> 20:18.040]  Representation that that's that cultivar should show
[20:18.680 --> 20:21.400]  Agree, that's you know, that's the reason I
[20:22.040 --> 20:28.580]  Choose that system over other ones because you know, it really gives me an idea of what the genetic
[20:29.480 --> 20:31.240]  can do and
[20:31.240 --> 20:32.360]  You know
[20:32.480 --> 20:38.280]  The genetic potential yeah, whatever said and you can manipulate it one way or another with you know certain
[20:38.960 --> 20:46.080]  Environments and certain feeds but you know, if I just put it in living soil and I know the plant has everything that it needs
[20:46.800 --> 20:48.800]  Without me having to play chemist
[20:49.680 --> 20:56.200]  Then the plants gonna show what it wants to show, you know, and my system is pretty dialed
[20:56.200 --> 21:02.000]  It's not perfect by any means. I'm always learning and always, you know adopting things, you know to
[21:02.800 --> 21:04.800]  really increase
[21:05.800 --> 21:09.480]  You know productivity in my gardens, but you know the
[21:10.600 --> 21:14.000]  End all be all is you know, living soil is gonna give
[21:14.720 --> 21:18.880]  Everything it needs to the plant and I'm gonna be able to see what I need to see
[21:20.680 --> 21:26.880]  While I'm breeding, you know, and then also, you know when I'm doing my selections for what to push the next generation or
[21:27.360 --> 21:35.080]  You know, what is gonna be the best hash making strain versus the best flower yielder versus you know
[21:36.160 --> 21:41.680]  All the you know, all the different criteria that a breeder may have or that I have
[21:42.480 --> 21:48.240]  You know or hash maker may have you know, I can really see plants true true colors, you know
[21:50.560 --> 21:55.400]  For those of us outside Colorado what's kind of the dominant like is it
[21:56.400 --> 22:00.480]  Indoor greenhouse, I'm not even talking grow media but like
[22:01.960 --> 22:08.120]  Is Colorado predominantly indoor greenhouse outdoor evenly distributed?
[22:08.120 --> 22:15.820]  I would say predominantly indoor like again by far, you know, they don't make it and is that because of regulations?
[22:16.600 --> 22:22.240]  Has something to do with that? Yeah, and also our outdoor seasons like what very short two three months out here
[22:22.240 --> 22:28.000]  Yeah, I mean we depend on you know here in Denver, you know where we are. It's we got a decent, you know
[22:28.480 --> 22:33.640]  Decently long outdoor season on the front range here Western Slope, Colorado is a bit longer
[22:33.960 --> 22:38.240]  But you know you start to get up above, you know, we're we're at a mile
[22:38.240 --> 22:43.000]  I you know, you start to get above 7,000 feet and you're really limited on your full Sun
[22:43.800 --> 22:46.900]  You know kind of applications greenhouse
[22:47.700 --> 22:53.540]  You know, it's just greenhouses are expensive and the way that the regulations kind of developed here in Colorado
[22:53.620 --> 22:57.900]  it was just a lot easier for people to start indoors and just kind of
[22:58.700 --> 23:01.300]  Expand that way and I think there's a big
[23:02.540 --> 23:04.340]  kind of
[23:04.340 --> 23:07.980]  Misunderstanding that indoor flower is the end-all be-all
[23:08.820 --> 23:15.020]  I'm a firm believer and you know, it's sun-drawn cannabis and you know indoor
[23:15.660 --> 23:22.740]  LED, you know, there's lots of applications that can really really bring out the true colors and cannabis
[23:22.740 --> 23:27.280]  But no matter how good your lighting is like you can't you're not the Sun, you know
[23:27.280 --> 23:31.820]  so all other things considered an environment dialed in, you know, you're
[23:32.340 --> 23:37.860]  The Sun's gonna be the way to go. So I wish there was more greenhouse and more outdoor flower
[23:38.900 --> 23:41.500]  Colorado, you know, I know in California, it's probably
[23:42.180 --> 23:45.780]  You know, I would say outdoor and greenhouse is probably the more predominant
[23:46.620 --> 23:51.700]  Way to go only because you know power so expensive luckily in Colorado, you know
[23:52.020 --> 23:57.780]  Excel powers cheap, you know, so people can get away with a couple hundred five hundred lights, you know and not
[23:58.300 --> 24:00.300]  Literally break the bank
[24:00.820 --> 24:07.060]  Whereas, you know other places that might have more expensive utilities, you know, like they gotta adapt a little differently, but
[24:07.900 --> 24:12.740]  Yeah, I would say indoor is predominant in Colorado just just kind of at least in the
[24:13.420 --> 24:17.940]  You know the regulated industry and just even side market, you know, not a lot of people do
[24:18.740 --> 24:20.740]  big full Sun
[24:21.500 --> 24:23.500]  Grows gorilla grows
[24:23.860 --> 24:25.740]  Yeah, yeah
[24:25.740 --> 24:27.900]  Not a lot of people do that here, you know
[24:28.540 --> 24:35.660]  Which we just have more extreme conditions. Definitely. Yeah, definitely. I mean we got we get a early, you know, we get wild
[24:35.700 --> 24:40.820]  You know, I mean we got a hard freeze for a couple days and you know a couple feet of snow on
[24:41.380 --> 24:43.340]  Labor Day this year, you know
[24:43.340 --> 24:49.860]  so that's easily a month before most people will be pulling their outdoor even in Colorado and
[24:50.460 --> 24:54.540]  You know, we we go through the extremes, you know, so
[24:55.220 --> 24:57.700]  You gotta you gotta pick your genetics, right?
[24:57.700 --> 25:00.300]  You know when you're growing here and you're growing outdoors and you know
[25:00.300 --> 25:02.740]  I've definitely got to pick stuff that's gonna you know
[25:02.740 --> 25:07.660]  Be on the shorter finishing side of things if you're gonna do full Sun and also, you know
[25:07.660 --> 25:12.980]  We got strong strong Sun here like it gets hot and the UVs intense
[25:12.980 --> 25:19.100]  so you need stuff that'll really you know, the drought tolerant, you know, like there's very little rain and
[25:19.580 --> 25:23.740]  You know Sun just beats down on these plants pretty much all season. So
[25:24.460 --> 25:28.180]  You know, you really got a selector cultivars, right to be able to
[25:28.700 --> 25:32.660]  Be successful kind of in that range
[25:34.580 --> 25:41.220]  How many are you usually running if you're when you're trying to pick out cultivars to put in like when I do it selections
[25:42.140 --> 25:46.660]  You know depends on obviously like probably on the home grow. I'm limited on plant count
[25:47.220 --> 25:53.220]  So I generally I like to pop at least 24 seeds of a particular strain
[25:54.220 --> 25:57.060]  At home, you know just because that's what I can do
[25:57.380 --> 26:01.700]  But you know the more the better like if I'm in a you know
[26:02.180 --> 26:06.500]  Legal environment plant counts not an issue, you know hundreds, you know
[26:06.500 --> 26:10.300]  If you're really gonna find that winner, you know more seeds you can pop the better
[26:10.300 --> 26:16.300]  You know and a lot of these cultivars you can buy, you know, like it's hard to get a thousand seats
[26:16.540 --> 26:18.540]  You know like without spending
[26:19.060 --> 26:22.900]  10 15 grand, you know to find that one at least
[26:24.780 --> 26:30.860]  So, you know, I mean you're talking, you know, even at 50 bucks a pack you pop pop 100 seeds, you know
[26:30.860 --> 26:33.780]  You're you're out five racks real quick, you know, so it's like
[26:35.100 --> 26:40.060]  There's limiting factors obviously, but more seeds are better man. Like the more that
[26:40.860 --> 26:42.860]  genetic diversity that you can
[26:43.740 --> 26:46.420]  explore the the better off you are and
[26:47.260 --> 26:48.420]  Generally
[26:48.420 --> 26:50.420]  You'll find winners
[26:50.500 --> 26:53.020]  If you pop that many seeds, you know
[26:53.020 --> 26:57.860]  There's a lot of I mean you pop ten seeds and you have a regular pack of seeds
[26:57.860 --> 27:04.340]  You know, like you're gonna end up with five or six females, you know, assuming 100% germination rate, you know
[27:04.340 --> 27:06.340]  Which you know isn't always the case
[27:07.460 --> 27:09.460]  So, you know
[27:09.540 --> 27:12.900]  Selecting for through six plants to find a winner
[27:13.580 --> 27:15.740]  Keeper, you know like is is
[27:17.260 --> 27:21.660]  Harder than it seems, you know, there is the max of the world and there is lots of
[27:22.660 --> 27:27.820]  You know strains that got lucky, you know, and I'm fortunately for me a lot of my strains
[27:27.820 --> 27:31.700]  You know are heavy hitters in a you know, pack of 15 seeds
[27:31.700 --> 27:35.780]  You're gonna find something you want to keep and continue to grow but you know in general
[27:36.380 --> 27:38.380]  more seeds you can pop and
[27:38.540 --> 27:44.060]  Really really hone in what your selection is, you know, whatever it be whether it be to make saltless hash
[27:44.300 --> 27:50.020]  You know like whether it be something that's drought tolerant might resistant, you know pest resistant
[27:50.900 --> 27:55.180]  Does well and you know to whatever your climate is, you know
[27:55.180 --> 28:00.020]  Like you gotta pop a lot of seeds to really to really find that that winner, you know
[28:00.020 --> 28:05.620]  And also get all the you know, the criteria that you want, you know for smoking, you know, or whatever
[28:06.140 --> 28:09.380]  Flavor profile on that, you know bag of you and all that stuff
[28:11.980 --> 28:13.980]  So, you know
[28:15.140 --> 28:16.780]  That's
[28:16.780 --> 28:20.340]  That's why breeding so important, you know, you got to do it, right?
[28:20.340 --> 28:23.500]  You got to do well because no one's spend 150 bucks on a pack of seeds
[28:23.500 --> 28:27.460]  It doesn't germinate and you're not gonna find something that you want to continue to grow
[28:28.100 --> 28:31.060]  That's my opinion obviously, but I feel that way
[28:32.060 --> 28:37.740]  Have you noticed that stuff expresses itself at 5,000 feet like, you know
[28:37.740 --> 28:43.700]  have you compared like someone who ran your genetics at an indoor grow in LA at basically sea level versus
[28:44.540 --> 28:46.540]  like is there what's
[28:47.300 --> 28:50.420]  What's the plant doing at 5,000 feet maybe differently?
[28:51.140 --> 28:54.500]  You know, I don't I don't know that there's any real data on
[28:55.300 --> 28:57.020]  altitude I
[28:57.020 --> 29:01.500]  Want to think there is I think that you know, if you just look at you know, the
[29:02.500 --> 29:08.820]  Evolution of cannabis, you know, like canvas is from high altitude, you know 8,000 9,000. Yeah, I think it's
[29:14.220 --> 29:17.580]  Like like one obvious I'm thinking outdoor now
[29:17.580 --> 29:20.380]  But like I think UV intensity would be a big one, right?
[29:20.380 --> 29:24.380]  Like I know when I grew up in Topanga where it's at elevation
[29:24.380 --> 29:27.020]  it was like that stuff was waxy and just like
[29:28.220 --> 29:30.220]  fighting the Sun
[29:30.420 --> 29:32.420]  Yeah
[29:32.780 --> 29:36.020]  Elevation but also atmospheric pressure I think is a big one
[29:36.620 --> 29:39.020]  The humidity is huge as well
[29:39.020 --> 29:47.140]  So huge the crazy amount of humidity in California compared to Colorado like my room right now my little tent sitting at like 30%
[29:47.140 --> 29:51.460]  And I'm struggling to keep it at 30% humidity. It's dry, right?
[29:51.620 --> 29:54.740]  Whereas California, I mean they're using dehuse
[29:55.820 --> 30:02.020]  So, you know, you'll I see a lot of differences between LA and Colorado
[30:03.660 --> 30:05.460]  Just in the structure
[30:05.460 --> 30:08.140]  the you know, I don't know density I
[30:08.980 --> 30:13.500]  Oftentimes see Colorado and in all reality. I see Colorado is bigger buds
[30:15.500 --> 30:20.700]  Yeah, there's something that California and the humidity does to keep those like air volatile turkeys
[30:21.460 --> 30:23.980]  You know and that's just like do we feel yeah
[30:23.980 --> 30:29.060]  I mean tell a lot easier to cure when your humidity is at 50 or 60 percent all the time that it is when you're
[30:29.060 --> 30:33.620]  You know, literally I think it's like 10% humidity out today. It's like yeah, you my little
[30:34.060 --> 30:38.540]  you really gotta you know dial in your dry room because you know you
[30:39.340 --> 30:42.620]  You don't have a dialed-in room where you're not doing anything to it
[30:42.620 --> 30:47.380]  You hang up, you know, you hang a plan up here in Colorado three days later. It's crispy
[30:47.460 --> 30:54.820]  You know like you volatilized a lot of you know those Turks and you haven't got a proper cure, you know on it
[30:54.820 --> 30:57.420]  you know that that low and slow, you know has
[30:58.020 --> 31:01.020]  definitely something to do with not only you know the smell and
[31:01.740 --> 31:04.100]  you know the smoke quality, but also, you know the
[31:04.860 --> 31:07.860]  The actual feel of the but you know
[31:07.860 --> 31:12.380]  Like when you get something that's sticky and you know, like the old school heads, you know
[31:12.380 --> 31:15.460]  They stick a blood on the wall, you know and it sticks. It's like those
[31:15.700 --> 31:21.900]  There's something to the humidity in California that like you don't see that here you got to be really dialed
[31:21.900 --> 31:27.940]  You know an indoor environments indoor environment like if you got a dialed-in door environment in Colorado, you know dialed-in door environment in LA
[31:28.580 --> 31:30.780]  Realistically, they should be the same, you know
[31:30.780 --> 31:37.140]  If you're going in the same get Vitas or LEDs and you got your humidity dialed and you know, you're you know
[31:37.140 --> 31:42.460]  Your VPD all set your soil everything, you know, like you should see comparable product, you know
[31:42.460 --> 31:48.100]  But outdoors really where you see the difference and you know, the the Sun is a totally different animal at you know
[31:48.100 --> 31:55.620]  I have a sphere and at altitude, you know, then from sea level to 5,000 feet like you can grow the same strain and
[31:56.140 --> 32:00.380]  It looks completely different on the shelf, you know or in your sack. So
[32:01.420 --> 32:03.100]  there's
[32:03.100 --> 32:07.140]  There's something to the altitude. There's something to the environment. You know, I think we all agree on that
[32:07.900 --> 32:09.900]  What are you using to build your soils?
[32:10.020 --> 32:12.020]  What are you using to build your soils
[32:12.420 --> 32:14.500]  Like is there a certain method that you're taking?
[32:14.980 --> 32:19.540]  Like for instance, I really follow more like the soil food web. I'm trying to build that up
[32:19.540 --> 32:23.620]  Yeah, is that more of your like kind of guiding principle? Yeah, I mean I
[32:24.660 --> 32:30.460]  There's a you know, good talk on Thursday about microscopes and everything. You know, I have a microscope but
[32:31.300 --> 32:33.300]  You know, I do think that
[32:33.820 --> 32:38.180]  Building your soil, you know, like for me I use a lot of compost and I use a lot of minerals
[32:38.900 --> 32:43.840]  You know to reamend and you know to keep my my soil biome happy
[32:44.420 --> 32:48.900]  Lots of organic matter for it for it to eat and then lots of you know
[32:49.780 --> 32:55.540]  rocks and minerals to provide the nutrition, you know that that you need so
[32:56.740 --> 32:58.580]  when I
[32:58.580 --> 33:04.860]  Just quickly is your own setup an indoor living soil or a greenhouse or an outdoor?
[33:08.660 --> 33:14.580]  Stuff are you know, I've been growing in the same like I don't till the soil in any of my outdoor
[33:15.500 --> 33:21.500]  Environments I've literally just replant right next to the plant year after year. I think I'm 10 years at one spot
[33:22.420 --> 33:24.820]  That and I don't do anything at this point
[33:24.820 --> 33:29.340]  Like I don't you know, I aside from a few top dresses of you know
[33:29.340 --> 33:34.900]  Maybe some craft blend from from building soil and you know a little compost addition
[33:34.900 --> 33:41.580]  You know, I I feel like it's just churning and burning and you know, I keep heavy mulch all the time
[33:41.780 --> 33:47.300]  You know, I mulch through the winter and that keeps all the biology happy at least on my outdoor spots
[33:47.300 --> 33:52.700]  You know my my indoor, you know, I have smaller containers, you know for living. So I've grown 30 gallon pots
[33:53.980 --> 33:58.580]  So that's what I mean, I guess that's maybe that's not small for most growers
[33:58.580 --> 34:01.900]  But you know the bigger volume of soil that you can get living
[34:02.740 --> 34:04.740]  living organics the better
[34:04.900 --> 34:08.380]  So, you know my my 30 gallon pots I have to amend
[34:09.660 --> 34:13.420]  you know every so often and it's really just compost and
[34:14.100 --> 34:17.940]  you know some top dresses of some, you know crustacean meals and
[34:18.900 --> 34:21.060]  That's really it. You know, I am
[34:22.420 --> 34:28.100]  You know in in the growth cycle. I add some kelp meals and alfalfa meal as top dress
[34:28.100 --> 34:30.440]  So I don't really mix that into my soil that often
[34:30.960 --> 34:34.160]  Because I am making you know, alfalfa teas or kelp teas or
[34:34.840 --> 34:38.640]  Extracts I should say I'm not really brewing much but you know really
[34:39.960 --> 34:45.160]  Top dressing heavily with those and just letting the worms and the biology eat that up
[34:45.920 --> 34:47.920]  underneath the mulch layer, so
[34:48.400 --> 34:51.360]  Keep it pretty simple. I definitely I
[34:52.360 --> 34:56.200]  Can't even remember the last time I got a soil test of my indoor
[34:57.200 --> 35:00.360]  Soil I probably should do that more often but
[35:01.040 --> 35:05.120]  You know soil tests are super helpful if you're trying to diagnose a problem
[35:05.120 --> 35:10.480]  But you know if your plants are happy and loving it and I'm just kind of continuing to do what I do
[35:11.920 --> 35:17.160]  And then greenhouse it's kind of a nice hybrid of that I grow raised beds greenhouse
[35:18.040 --> 35:19.480]  and
[35:19.480 --> 35:25.360]  They you know, I tend to burn through my organic matter really fast in the greenhouse. I don't know if it's because it's
[35:26.520 --> 35:34.280]  The plants are super vigorous in there compared to you know outdoor and my indoor they have you know that perfect
[35:34.720 --> 35:37.760]  You know, I keep a little humidity in there. They got that perfect environment
[35:37.760 --> 35:41.760]  so I do have to add in lots of compost every year in my
[35:42.320 --> 35:44.320]  my greenhouse beds, so
[35:45.240 --> 35:49.440]  You know try to be as local as possible with the compost but you know
[35:50.040 --> 35:53.440]  There's not a lot of great sources here in Colorado for compost. So
[35:54.240 --> 36:00.680]  If I'm going for some sort of dairy compost, you know, I'll go with Malibu if I'm trying to go with you know more
[36:01.560 --> 36:05.960]  Woody kind of fish compost, you know, I'll go with on a mountain
[36:07.400 --> 36:09.760]  But you know, I try to keep those locals possible
[36:09.760 --> 36:16.880]  I compost in my house, but I can't produce enough volume to really amend all of my beds every single time
[36:16.880 --> 36:18.880]  you know, so
[36:19.160 --> 36:21.160]  Keep it simple, you know
[36:21.480 --> 36:23.360]  Compost minerals
[36:23.360 --> 36:26.320]  And just kind of judge the plants you what it needs
[36:27.320 --> 36:32.760]  And then obviously get a soil test if necessary. So it's kind of how I read them from cycle to cycle
[36:34.000 --> 36:36.000]  Obviously I have worms too
[36:36.080 --> 36:39.240]  They go through cycles in my indoor
[36:40.080 --> 36:48.360]  30 gallons where I don't know if the worms get so dense that they start to die off or if I just have
[36:48.800 --> 36:49.880]  imbalances
[36:49.880 --> 36:51.880]  In what they like
[36:52.520 --> 36:56.440]  Because I end up having to add worms probably once a year
[36:56.440 --> 37:00.720]  I know a lot of people that they add some worms and that's the last time they ever do it
[37:00.720 --> 37:04.880]  I haven't got it dialed in enough with the earthworms and the wigglers
[37:05.960 --> 37:07.960]  But you know
[37:08.160 --> 37:10.160]  Always learning
[37:10.320 --> 37:14.360]  So so do you have a straw? I mean, I know Brian we talked about this the other day
[37:14.360 --> 37:21.240]  But do you have kind of the earthworms are like creating air tunnels down below and the wigglers are composting up above?
[37:21.800 --> 37:25.640]  Yeah, I mean, that's what's great is like, you know, I think diversity is key
[37:25.640 --> 37:32.300]  You know when it comes to anything really these living systems like, you know diverse cover cropping and you know
[37:33.080 --> 37:35.080]  diverse species
[37:35.280 --> 37:40.920]  You know soil biology really kind of covers all your bases. So yeah, I mean earthworms
[37:41.720 --> 37:46.400]  You know run from top to bottom and they kind of they're the aerators and they're the you know
[37:46.400 --> 37:53.400]  Big hogs when it comes to you know, moving nutrients from the surface down to lower parts of your of your soil structure strata
[37:55.160 --> 37:59.960]  When it comes to red wigglers, they just just crush and turn, you know
[38:00.880 --> 38:07.280]  Organic matter into worm castings right away. And you know, so those end up infiltrating water
[38:08.160 --> 38:14.120]  And sort of you know have fill in those pockets of the earthworms make you know, so
[38:16.160 --> 38:22.680]  At least indoors, you know, it works super well and outdoors I just I don't add any regular red wigglers outside
[38:22.880 --> 38:30.160]  I just let the worms that are in the ground do their thing. That's predominantly earthworms here. We got a lot of clay in Colorado. So
[38:31.000 --> 38:35.480]  These are forms just know how to break that up and you know make all of that
[38:35.640 --> 38:42.520]  I mean, there's so much all the minerals that you need in that clay, you know, it's just a matter of getting broken up and
[38:43.440 --> 38:46.680]  have water infiltrate and you know have
[38:47.280 --> 38:51.880]  Let the worms do the work of you know, breaking it up and then you know, bringing it to the surface
[38:52.680 --> 38:54.200]  so
[38:54.200 --> 38:59.800]  Yeah, I think you know and obviously your your macro biology to you know
[38:59.800 --> 39:06.400]  Like lots of your shredders and your know your centipedes and your roly-poly is in your you know your other stuff
[39:06.400 --> 39:12.400]  That's not just bacteria and fungi, you know really help. So, you know the more healthy
[39:13.080 --> 39:17.280]  soil biome you have, you know, the better you're gonna be and
[39:18.320 --> 39:24.640]  You know, it balances itself, you know, I heard you guys talking about the roly-poly outbreak
[39:25.200 --> 39:32.760]  On Thursday and I have experienced this exact thing and you know, it eventually balances itself out
[39:32.760 --> 39:39.280]  But you know the when you get an influx of one thing or another, you know, it can cause problems or you know
[39:39.320 --> 39:44.400]  Whether that be for your cannabis plant or for your vegetables or whatever, you know, I'm a thorough believer like I grow
[39:45.040 --> 39:49.600]  Lots of things not just cannabis, you know grow more than cannabis, you know grow more than ganja
[39:49.600 --> 39:53.240]  it's kind of been my you know, my motto for a long time and I
[39:53.800 --> 39:59.560]  Treat the soil the same, you know, like living soil it's gonna crush a tomato or
[40:00.680 --> 40:05.880]  You know a potato or you know, some amazing medicine, you know all the same
[40:10.640 --> 40:14.560]  So just quickly I'm looking at some of the
[40:15.360 --> 40:17.360]  questions people are asking one
[40:18.040 --> 40:20.040]  Steven just asked and I
[40:20.480 --> 40:23.400]  Doubt this is the case of a lot of the grows are indoors
[40:23.880 --> 40:32.360]  but I just got back from Tom's house earlier today and his little home grows been ravaged by caterpillars or
[40:34.000 --> 40:40.540]  Caterpillars any sort of problem. I would assume if there are more outdoor grows, that'd be a problem. But are there like what what are the
[40:41.600 --> 40:44.720]  what pests are most prevalent in kind of the
[40:45.280 --> 40:48.720]  Colorado grows that you've been coming across I
[40:49.840 --> 40:54.920]  Mean this is the time of year where a lot of your like capos are huge deal outdoors, Colorado
[40:55.760 --> 41:01.040]  This time of year the fall when everything started died back and all your kind of plant material is starting to
[41:01.640 --> 41:05.160]  Die off in your yard, you know a lot of these bugs will go to
[41:05.760 --> 41:11.320]  You know, they're the next healthy thing to eat and if it happens to your cannabis plants that they're gonna move right in
[41:11.440 --> 41:19.680]  You know, so I mean here the biggest things that people deal with are the typical stuff, you know russet mites two-spotted bites
[41:20.600 --> 41:23.440]  The peach avid or the you know, the canvas avid
[41:23.960 --> 41:25.960]  Are probably the big three
[41:26.440 --> 41:30.080]  Obviously fungus gnats a lot of people have fungus gnats, especially with soil
[41:30.840 --> 41:35.800]  You know your moisture contents up and you're adding a lot of organic matter to the surface
[41:36.480 --> 41:40.040]  It's perfect breeding ground for fungus gnats. But you know those
[41:40.760 --> 41:46.960]  Are less detrimental, you know, they're just annoying and they you know, they get up in your blood, you know
[41:46.960 --> 41:53.320]  That'll affect you know, like I'm sure you like can get some flowers that are just you know
[41:53.320 --> 41:58.960]  It's interesting about it is like I love doing these macro shots and like working with macro photographers
[41:58.960 --> 42:05.440]  So that's what I can really see, you know, and you know, the little orange specs being some mites oftentimes, you know
[42:05.440 --> 42:08.040]  Yeah, we see it in the product
[42:08.600 --> 42:10.600]  If you have issues
[42:11.000 --> 42:13.000]  especially flyers
[42:14.480 --> 42:20.120]  Stuff like that would make it to your you know get crushed up or in your process and make it through the micro bags
[42:21.680 --> 42:26.680]  So I've been experimenting with a rove beetle was trying to be a little more proactive for that fungus night
[42:26.680 --> 42:29.680]  I don't have you experimented with that at all. Yeah
[42:31.680 --> 42:34.560]  And just quickly this was from earlier today
[42:35.280 --> 42:40.760]  Those things was the eat of your buds man like there, you know, they'll live on your on your veg plants
[42:40.760 --> 42:46.120]  But once they get in your buds, they literally they eat they eat them like they eat them from a stock out
[42:46.120 --> 42:52.560]  So you get you know little dead spots of the blood and that invites I mean with their with their poop and everything like it
[42:52.560 --> 42:55.160]  Invites old, you know a lot of times, you know
[42:55.160 --> 43:01.080]  You'll see butt rock first and you'll be like wow that looks like the tritis and then you start digging in there
[43:05.320 --> 43:07.320]  But so yeah, I mean
[43:07.800 --> 43:13.000]  Caterpillars are they're definitely problem, you know, I see a less indoors Colorado
[43:14.000 --> 43:20.200]  Only because you know, if you have a pretty sealed system like there's a lot of other stuff that caterpillars gonna want to eat
[43:21.360 --> 43:27.620]  Then your cannabis, but you know you bring in the wrong cover crop or you plant something, you know
[43:27.620 --> 43:32.480]  Like you have something other growing in your house, you know, I mean it's easy to bring those things in
[43:33.480 --> 43:37.840]  So, yeah, I mean they're they're no joke
[43:38.800 --> 43:40.800]  Road beetles back to road beetles though
[43:41.640 --> 43:43.640]  I'm a huge fan
[43:43.760 --> 43:46.560]  They kind of just show up naturally in my soil
[43:47.040 --> 43:52.600]  I've never like purchased any from you know, an insectary or whatever. They're just they're in my compost and
[43:53.600 --> 43:58.160]  They do their thing. Honestly, the best thing I found for fungus nets is nematodes
[43:58.960 --> 44:01.360]  couple applications of the standard ema felt yay
[44:02.480 --> 44:06.280]  You know some of the more active nematodes that search out the pests
[44:06.880 --> 44:08.920]  Spanning emas are kind of more
[44:10.200 --> 44:13.360]  Sedentary and like when a fungus that larvae comes by it they eat it
[44:13.800 --> 44:17.440]  There's some predatory ones that actually go out and try to find food
[44:18.120 --> 44:20.120]  That's been my best
[44:20.240 --> 44:23.480]  You know kind of thing to help with with fungus gnats
[44:23.480 --> 44:27.960]  I mean a couple applications of nematodes and get them boosted up in your soil strata
[44:28.880 --> 44:33.640]  You'll have a flush of some flyers and then all the you know, all the babies are dead
[44:33.640 --> 44:36.880]  So, you know, you won't get them after that
[44:38.200 --> 44:39.840]  so
[44:39.840 --> 44:42.640]  Yeah, but you know, once again diversity is key with that biology
[44:42.640 --> 44:46.920]  you know, I mean if you can keep those road beetles up and those springtails and your
[44:48.520 --> 44:53.000]  You know your your nematodes all kind of balance, you know, there's very few soil
[44:53.560 --> 44:59.840]  You know dwelling past that you'll ever have to deal with, you know, like you'll not deal with root aphids you'll not deal with
[45:01.080 --> 45:02.440]  You know
[45:02.440 --> 45:08.400]  Fungus gnats and you know a lot of those things, you know, we've not had the root knot nematode here
[45:08.400 --> 45:11.320]  I know it's been a problem on the west coast for some people but
[45:12.160 --> 45:19.160]  You know pretty much, you know, your healthy soil will balance itself out and it's hard to
[45:19.680 --> 45:23.280]  It's hard to get a gnarly pest in there that won't get eaten by something else
[45:25.880 --> 45:31.800]  Everyone in the chat wants to see Brian come on and and rip off that dab rig
[45:39.680 --> 45:42.120]  They've been looking at those two unused pipes
[45:50.160 --> 45:51.480]  Okay
[45:51.480 --> 45:54.940]  So yeah, I think I think next level was really
[45:55.680 --> 46:02.160]  Being proactive and then one of the biggest issues that I had when I was first starting out is really trusting the process
[46:03.040 --> 46:08.600]  Because I was still cultivating with like a cocoa perlite mix. Yeah while I was learning living soil
[46:09.760 --> 46:16.520]  And then kind of you know when you're learning, all right, so the worm the composting worms regulate what's going on. Where's this?
[46:20.160 --> 46:21.840]  And
[46:21.840 --> 46:23.840]  Brian you're gonna critique next work
[46:24.680 --> 46:26.280]  Yeah
[46:26.280 --> 46:28.280]  Don't don't hold back
[46:28.280 --> 46:31.280]  Yields horribly like 1.2 percent
[46:32.800 --> 46:36.680]  Smells delicious just straight. Oh gee and it was so long since I smelled that
[46:38.080 --> 46:45.800]  OG smell cuz nobody runs it anymore. Nobody makes Ross not a bit right now Bible. It was not not as viable but
[46:46.520 --> 46:48.760]  It's again, it's got that sure why'd you bring this Nick
[47:06.750 --> 47:10.870]  So I feel like if I'm judging something I like to blow it through the nose and that was super clean
[47:10.870 --> 47:15.030]  Yeah, that doesn't burn at all so I mean if I'm taking it just as a
[47:16.030 --> 47:19.830]  Judging it on a side of things smells delicious doesn't burn
[47:20.710 --> 47:25.110]  Straight to the face, which I feel like it's kind of like, you know, you feel it underneath the eyes a little bit
[47:26.990 --> 47:28.990]  Really kicking in I feel it
[47:29.950 --> 47:31.950]  It's almost like a lightning quick
[47:33.710 --> 47:35.710]  I'm getting goosebumps
[47:35.710 --> 47:37.710]  I'm getting goosebumps
[47:38.430 --> 47:40.430]  And
[47:40.630 --> 47:44.510]  Yeah, it feels great well you you need him as your official hype man
[47:47.270 --> 47:49.270]  Like the goose well, I think
[47:50.270 --> 47:52.270]  Being a
[47:52.270 --> 47:55.070]  Do you judge that too, right? So you were just focused up
[47:55.470 --> 48:00.870]  That was something that I feel like shout out to sticky lungs where he allowed build a soil those guys allowed us to have
[48:00.870 --> 48:03.710]  I think it was like a month to be able to smoke his stuff
[48:03.710 --> 48:07.590]  And I feel like that's really the difference and I hope that in time we start to see
[48:08.110 --> 48:13.350]  If someone's gonna talk about putting a cup together, let's let's have a real cup where you know
[48:13.350 --> 48:18.070]  You give us a month maybe two months to judge that stuff. I feel like this is the next level obviously
[48:18.390 --> 48:22.870]  That's why I'm a huge proponent for living soils because I want to be able to smoke clean medicine
[48:22.870 --> 48:24.670]  I mean, that's really the goal
[48:24.670 --> 48:28.750]  I should be able to blow that out of my nose and my opinion and and
[48:28.750 --> 48:32.670]  So I feel like that's where the market is going at least in my opinion
[48:35.270 --> 48:41.430]  Just a quick I'm looking at the chat again, so is Ezekiel Vasquez
[48:42.750 --> 48:49.150]  Or Vasquez said bugs don't infest big thriving luscious plants. They infest and kill off all the sick and weak plants
[48:49.150 --> 48:52.150]  So only the strong and the weak plants are allowed to grow
[48:52.150 --> 48:55.110]  So I think that's a really good point. I think that's a really good point
[48:55.330 --> 48:57.330]  So, you know if you have bugs is because
[48:58.050 --> 49:03.130]  basically your plants are sickly, but I feel like with with caterpillars specifically
[49:03.130 --> 49:07.770]  I don't think they discriminate between weak and healthy plants. I think like a
[49:08.510 --> 49:11.270]  Healthy plant is a delicious plant for a caterpillar
[49:12.470 --> 49:16.570]  Yeah, I mean, I would agree with that too, but I do think there is
[49:17.490 --> 49:21.750]  There's a level of you know, there's a lot of stuff that has to do with your environment as well that you know
[49:21.750 --> 49:25.850]  There's a lot of stuff that has to do with your environment as well that will invite
[49:25.850 --> 49:33.030]  pests in, not necessarily just whether the plant is weak or sick, but most definitely
[49:33.030 --> 49:39.490]  a super healthy, robust plant is going to be much more resistant to pretty much anything
[49:39.490 --> 49:49.050]  you throw at it than something that's a little old and tired or imbalanced or sick in some
[49:49.050 --> 49:56.010]  sort of way, like holistically or literally nutritionally sick.
[49:56.010 --> 49:58.490]  I think that's absolutely true.
[49:58.490 --> 50:05.850]  But there's also a level to your pest pressure too that I don't care how healthy your garden
[50:05.850 --> 50:15.090]  is, if you let your pests become a problem and their numbers get so high, they're going
[50:15.090 --> 50:16.090]  to kill everything.
[50:16.090 --> 50:23.410]  It doesn't matter how beautiful or lush it is, it's just a numbers game at that point.
[50:23.410 --> 50:28.850]  We talked about this with Josh and Leighton last time, Peter, where I do feel like if
[50:28.850 --> 50:33.370]  you're able to start to put in that crustacean meal and get that chitin up, are you familiar
[50:33.370 --> 50:37.170]  with building that up?
[50:37.170 --> 50:47.650]  I know that it's a great food source for fungus and actually mushrooms are a great producer
[50:47.650 --> 50:54.410]  of chitin other than sea animals and seashells.
[50:54.410 --> 51:01.650]  But I do think there's benefits both ways of having it.
[51:01.650 --> 51:04.250]  I think you can overdo it with crustacean meal.
[51:04.250 --> 51:09.730]  A lot of that's not plant available, so you've really got to have your enzymes and your biological
[51:09.730 --> 51:10.730]  activity rocking.
[51:10.730 --> 51:17.890]  Because the plant cannot take a shrimp shell, it needs to be digested by the worms and by
[51:17.890 --> 51:18.890]  the other stuff that's in your soil.
[51:18.890 --> 51:19.890]  That's for the microbes, I feel like, for sure.
[51:19.890 --> 51:20.890]  Yeah, definitely.
[51:20.890 --> 51:26.530]  For me, it's one of the first things I put in because I know it might not even be for
[51:26.530 --> 51:28.370]  the first food, to be honest.
[51:28.370 --> 51:29.370]  Yeah, absolutely.
[51:29.370 --> 51:30.370]  That's definitely long-term nutrition.
[51:31.370 --> 51:35.970]  When you're thinking oyster shell flower, you might not see that digested and become
[51:35.970 --> 51:39.410]  plant available for a year, straight up.
[51:39.410 --> 51:47.250]  It can affect your pH one way or the other, but really it's very, very, very slow release.
[51:47.250 --> 51:49.250]  You don't need a lot of that.
[51:49.250 --> 51:58.290]  Chitin is, I just see my plant supercharged when it's available and it's being broken
[51:58.290 --> 51:59.290]  down quickly.
[51:59.290 --> 52:07.090]  The biology, really, it's the biology that gets ripped from it and then the soil churns
[52:07.090 --> 52:12.730]  and your plant really benefits from everything being super available and being able to take
[52:12.730 --> 52:13.730]  what it needs.
[52:13.730 --> 52:15.770]  Have you been able to experiment with kefir?
[52:15.770 --> 52:17.770]  Are you familiar with that?
[52:17.770 --> 52:22.210]  Yeah, I've actually never put that in my soil.
[52:22.210 --> 52:25.850]  I do add kombucha to something.
[52:25.850 --> 52:27.850]  Kind of the same concept.
[52:28.410 --> 52:32.410]  Yeah, just not without the dairy portion, but I'm all about labs.
[52:32.410 --> 52:35.410]  I'm all about labs though.
[52:35.410 --> 52:37.410]  I'm a fan of the lactic acid.
[52:37.410 --> 52:41.410]  I feel like intermittent fasting, to change over for a second, I've been on that for almost
[52:41.410 --> 52:42.410]  90 days now.
[52:42.410 --> 52:46.410]  I feel like everything is starting to really work for me.
[52:46.410 --> 52:48.410]  Do you guys ever try that?
[52:48.410 --> 52:50.410]  I just kind of do that anyway.
[52:50.410 --> 52:51.410]  It's just because I'm busy.
[52:51.410 --> 52:52.410]  I know him too.
[52:52.410 --> 52:55.410]  It's just like, I don't know, I got time to eat all the time.
[52:55.970 --> 52:59.970]  I wake up, get some coffee, and the next thing you know, it's dinner time.
[52:59.970 --> 53:04.970]  My body just naturally relates to that sort of diet.
[53:04.970 --> 53:08.970]  That's when I started growing my plants and I would notice that, like you were saying
[53:08.970 --> 53:13.970]  before, the 30 gallon is more of like, I don't know if you said stomach, but that's really
[53:13.970 --> 53:14.970]  where I view it.
[53:14.970 --> 53:18.970]  Once I started to drizzle that kefir around that stuff and the microbial world started
[53:18.970 --> 53:21.970]  to break that down, I see the praying leaves start to take hold.
[53:22.530 --> 53:25.530]  That's when I started to enjoy kombucha and kefir.
[53:25.530 --> 53:29.530]  I feel like my whole view of life again kind of changed.
[53:29.530 --> 53:31.530]  I grew up in Georgia.
[53:31.530 --> 53:35.530]  We eat lard with green beans that nobody talks about.
[53:35.530 --> 53:38.530]  We thought chicken for 99 cents was the same thing.
[53:38.530 --> 53:39.530]  It was organic.
[53:39.530 --> 53:40.530]  It was chicken.
[53:40.530 --> 53:41.530]  It was cheaper.
[53:41.530 --> 53:44.530]  So misled for a lot of my life.
[53:44.530 --> 53:47.530]  Yeah, we can learn a lot from our plants.
[53:48.090 --> 53:53.090]  You can tell when the plants have optimal nutrition and a lot of those same things are
[53:53.090 --> 53:55.090]  going to be helpful for us.
[53:55.090 --> 54:02.090]  A lot of this living soil, like K&F sort of style, the nutrients I'm making for my plant,
[54:02.090 --> 54:04.090]  I can consume them too.
[54:04.090 --> 54:06.090]  It's like air.
[54:06.090 --> 54:07.090]  That's the way it should be.
[54:07.090 --> 54:10.090]  We're not feeding the plant poison.
[54:10.090 --> 54:11.090]  That's the same thing as the plants need?
[54:11.090 --> 54:12.090]  Absolutely.
[54:12.090 --> 54:13.090]  You know what I mean?
[54:13.090 --> 54:16.090]  Ultimately, the plants are going to be feeding us.
[54:16.650 --> 54:18.650]  The nutrition you give it translates to us.
[54:18.650 --> 54:25.650]  You can cut out the middleman a lot of times with the plant and just go right for it.
[54:25.650 --> 54:28.650]  But yeah, kefir, I'm a huge fan.
[54:28.650 --> 54:31.650]  I've consumed it for myself.
[54:31.650 --> 54:33.650]  I've never given it to my plants.
[54:33.650 --> 54:35.650]  I've heard a lot of testimonials.
[54:35.650 --> 54:36.650]  People love doing that.
[54:36.650 --> 54:44.650]  Like I said, I know my plants respond to probiotics very, very, very positively.
[54:45.210 --> 54:51.210]  Stephen said, but kombucha has alcohol.
[54:51.210 --> 54:53.210]  Does kombucha have...
[54:55.210 --> 54:57.210]  It has a tiny bit, right?
[54:57.210 --> 54:59.210]  Yeah, it's got some alcohol in it.
[54:59.210 --> 55:02.210]  A lot of these byproduct of fermentation, not just kombucha.
[55:02.210 --> 55:05.210]  When you ferment stuff, you're going to get some alcohols.
[55:05.210 --> 55:06.210]  That's okay.
[55:06.210 --> 55:09.210]  Obviously, your plant's not going to take a shot of vodka very well.
[55:09.770 --> 55:14.770]  But if it has a little bit of alcohol in it, that's okay.
[55:14.770 --> 55:20.770]  A lot of those alcohols will help break down other things in your soil.
[55:21.770 --> 55:28.770]  Alcohol's been used for generations as a pest control for your plants.
[55:28.770 --> 55:34.770]  You can spray alcohol on your plants and high-grain alcohol will evaporate quicker.
[55:35.770 --> 55:37.770]  Obviously, you got to be very careful about that.
[55:38.330 --> 55:39.330]  I wouldn't recommend it to most people.
[55:39.330 --> 55:43.330]  But alcohol is okay in small doses.
[55:44.330 --> 55:48.330]  Kombucha has like 0.5% alcohol or something less by volume.
[55:48.330 --> 55:53.330]  When you're giving it to your plants, obviously, you're probably diluting it in your reservoir.
[55:54.330 --> 55:59.330]  To some way, the amount of alcohol in those type of ferments is pretty negligible.
[55:59.890 --> 56:00.890]  I agree with that.
[56:01.890 --> 56:09.890]  I've seen no detrimental effects from little bits of alcohol in my ferments.
[56:10.890 --> 56:12.890]  The plant factory seemed to like it.
[56:14.890 --> 56:16.890]  You're playing around with different sugars and stuff.
[56:16.890 --> 56:18.890]  I know you said you were doing more extracts.
[56:18.890 --> 56:26.890]  I feel like more of the older guard, if you will, seems to also be moving away from making
[56:27.450 --> 56:32.450]  the actively aerated compost teas, moving towards the extract, and moving on with their day.
[56:33.450 --> 56:34.450]  Yeah.
[56:34.450 --> 56:37.450]  What the plant does is make carbohydrates.
[56:38.450 --> 56:40.450]  The plant makes all the sugars that it needs.
[56:41.450 --> 56:44.450]  It's going to feed the sugars directly to the soil biology.
[56:45.450 --> 56:50.450]  A majority of the carbohydrates that the plant makes in photosynthesis, it feeds to the soil.
[56:50.450 --> 56:56.450]  It sends down to the root zone so that it can activate some biology over the other.
[56:57.450 --> 57:00.450]  Some microbe that likes the sugar, that like carbohydrate.
[57:03.450 --> 57:07.450]  Just quickly, people are hammering on the chat, where can they buy your damn seeds?
[57:09.450 --> 57:10.450]  I know you mentioned it earlier.
[57:13.450 --> 57:16.450]  You can hit me direct on my Instagram.
[57:17.450 --> 57:18.450]  I'll post that.
[57:19.450 --> 57:20.450]  Cool.
[57:20.450 --> 57:25.450]  You can hit my email, greg, g-r-e-g, at genomealchemy.com.
[57:26.010 --> 57:29.010]  That's like I said, I sell direct.
[57:30.010 --> 57:31.010]  I'm not in any seed banks at the moment.
[57:32.010 --> 57:37.010]  I was in a couple that have since stopped doing their thing.
[57:38.010 --> 57:41.010]  Right now, if you want seeds, just hit me up direct and I'll get you seeds.
[57:43.010 --> 57:45.010]  Or hit Nick up and he'll get you seeds.
[57:46.010 --> 57:47.010]  That's why we're doing this, man.
[57:48.010 --> 57:50.010]  We want to get Greg on the map a little bit.
[57:50.570 --> 57:55.570]  Anyone can reach out to me and I'll help you figure it out after.
[57:55.570 --> 57:57.570]  I posted your Instagram.
[58:00.570 --> 58:01.570]  Awesome.
[58:03.570 --> 58:04.570]  That's great.
[58:05.570 --> 58:07.570]  Carry on with your knowledge drop-in.
[58:08.570 --> 58:10.570]  I don't even remember where I was at this point.
[58:11.570 --> 58:13.570]  I was off a tangent somewhere.
[58:14.130 --> 58:15.130]  I feel like there's a thing.
[58:16.130 --> 58:21.130]  Red State Rebels asked, how do we know if we are buying a good compost?
[58:22.130 --> 58:27.130]  If you're doing an extraction rather than a tea,
[58:28.130 --> 58:31.130]  what are you using as your source wash material?
[58:32.130 --> 58:38.130]  Is that the Malibu compost or something like your own home compost?
[58:39.130 --> 58:40.130]  All of the above.
[58:40.690 --> 58:45.690]  The best way to know if you're getting a good compost is to ask whoever you're buying compost from
[58:45.690 --> 58:46.690]  to see a soil test.
[58:47.690 --> 58:50.690]  There's a lot of good resources on how to read those soil tests.
[58:52.690 --> 58:54.690]  How do you know you're getting a good compost?
[58:55.690 --> 58:56.690]  You vermicompost it yourself.
[58:57.690 --> 58:59.690]  Obviously, homemade is the best.
[59:02.690 --> 59:07.690]  Actually, Brian, he said he can't produce enough compost himself,
[59:08.250 --> 59:10.250]  so he needs to bring it in from the outside.
[59:11.250 --> 59:12.250]  That's a challenge.
[59:13.250 --> 59:14.250]  I try to be proactive.
[59:15.250 --> 59:19.250]  I'll say if it's a larger grow, we get 100-gallon fabric pots
[59:20.250 --> 59:22.250]  and try to be as proactive as possible and get that churning
[59:23.250 --> 59:25.250]  so that we can at least inoculate on a higher level,
[59:26.250 --> 59:27.250]  especially with composting worms,
[59:28.250 --> 59:31.250]  so that they start to churn that soil into worm castings
[59:32.250 --> 59:34.250]  and break down organic matter.
[59:34.810 --> 59:41.810]  Back to the extract talk, you can definitely spread a little bit of compost
[59:42.810 --> 59:45.810]  a lot farther when you put it in the solution and make a compost extract.
[59:46.810 --> 59:47.810]  Compost tea, too.
[59:48.810 --> 59:52.810]  Once you start aerating compost and start making aerated brews,
[59:53.810 --> 59:57.810]  you really got to know what you're doing and have your cycles on point
[59:58.810 --> 59:59.810]  and your timing on point,
[01:00:00.810 --> 01:00:03.810]  or you'll brew maybe something you didn't want in there.
[01:00:04.810 --> 01:00:08.810]  If there was some E. coli or something in your source of compost,
[01:00:09.810 --> 01:00:13.810]  you'll brew that and give it some molasses and E. coli is going crazy.
[01:00:14.810 --> 01:00:17.810]  I like extracts because that gives me directly,
[01:00:18.810 --> 01:00:20.810]  it just washes off all the biology and puts it into the soil
[01:00:21.810 --> 01:00:28.810]  so that my soil volume, strata, whatever, the stomach of my plant's digestive system
[01:00:29.810 --> 01:00:30.810]  can do what it will with it.
[01:00:31.370 --> 01:00:38.370]  Obviously, sourcing good compost and then not, a little goes a long way.
[01:00:39.370 --> 01:00:40.370]  That's what I was going to ask.
[01:00:41.370 --> 01:00:42.370]  Are you doing small batch?
[01:00:43.370 --> 01:00:44.370]  Are you doing a five-gallon bucket?
[01:00:45.370 --> 01:00:46.370]  Do you have a go-to bucket?
[01:00:47.370 --> 01:00:51.370]  Generally, depending on what I'm doing, it might be 10 gallons.
[01:00:52.370 --> 01:00:58.370]  I might do an IBC tote, a thousand liter tote of compost extract.
[01:00:58.930 --> 01:01:01.930]  Obviously, it depends on how much compost I have.
[01:01:02.930 --> 01:01:05.930]  I don't do that too often because my biology is pretty set.
[01:01:06.930 --> 01:01:10.930]  I don't need to be making weekly or biweekly compost extracts.
[01:01:11.930 --> 01:01:16.930]  If you have compost around and you want to stretch it,
[01:01:17.930 --> 01:01:22.930]  I would say making an extract is better than top dressing with it.
[01:01:23.930 --> 01:01:24.930]  You can stretch it farther, put it on more plants,
[01:01:25.490 --> 01:01:31.490]  and get the biology onto more surface area when you put it in a solution
[01:01:32.490 --> 01:01:38.490]  versus you've got a yard of compost that's going to give you a few plants worth
[01:01:39.490 --> 01:01:42.490]  two inches thick where you can take that yard of compost
[01:01:43.490 --> 01:01:48.490]  and make insane amounts of liquid extract that you can then put on acres.
[01:01:49.050 --> 01:01:54.050]  If you can get good compost, and like I said, I like Olly Mountain
[01:01:55.050 --> 01:01:56.050]  and I like Malibu compost.
[01:01:57.050 --> 01:02:00.050]  Besides Malibu compost, say the other one slowly.
[01:02:01.050 --> 01:02:02.050]  It's called Olly Mountain, O-L-L-Y.
[01:02:03.050 --> 01:02:07.050]  That's not a dairy compost where Malibu is straight from cows.
[01:02:08.050 --> 01:02:15.050]  A lot of people like to grow veganic or maybe don't want cow manure
[01:02:15.610 --> 01:02:20.610]  or cow sources of compost and want to go more of a...
[01:02:21.610 --> 01:02:25.610]  This comes from fish and lots of forest products.
[01:02:26.610 --> 01:02:30.610]  I find that Olly Mountain tends to be really fungally dominant,
[01:02:31.610 --> 01:02:34.610]  which is good for a lot of applications.
[01:02:35.610 --> 01:02:39.610]  I'm a fan of manure because cows are just kind of umbilical
[01:02:40.610 --> 01:02:41.610]  and ruminants are like kind of...
[01:02:42.170 --> 01:02:49.170]  This is my permaculture mindset, but they are the key to building soil
[01:02:50.170 --> 01:02:52.170]  is having that component.
[01:02:53.170 --> 01:02:57.170]  Not only their manure, but actually them stepping around on things
[01:02:58.170 --> 01:03:00.170]  and eating it, grazing it, and all that.
[01:03:01.170 --> 01:03:03.170]  I think dairy manure is a...
[01:03:04.170 --> 01:03:06.170]  When it's clean and it's ethically sourced
[01:03:07.170 --> 01:03:09.170]  and all of those things that Malibu is,
[01:03:09.730 --> 01:03:12.730]  I think it's a vital component in living soil.
[01:03:13.730 --> 01:03:17.730]  Even if you have a local source of vegetable compost,
[01:03:18.730 --> 01:03:24.730]  like at your community garden or at an organic farm near you,
[01:03:25.730 --> 01:03:29.730]  all those sort of things, shop local and definitely try to find
[01:03:30.730 --> 01:03:34.730]  a farmer that's transparent or just a seller that's transparent
[01:03:35.730 --> 01:03:37.730]  with you about what you're getting for your compost.
[01:03:38.290 --> 01:03:40.290]  If they're not going to provide you a soil test,
[01:03:41.290 --> 01:03:43.290]  obviously take a sample and get one.
[01:03:44.290 --> 01:03:46.290]  That's a big red flag right there.
[01:03:47.290 --> 01:03:48.290]  Absolutely.
[01:03:49.290 --> 01:03:52.290]  A lot of people, they don't have one because they're just small-time farmers
[01:03:53.290 --> 01:03:55.290]  that haven't put it on a work site, they haven't tested it, whatever.
[01:03:56.290 --> 01:04:00.290]  But obviously, know what you're getting into when you get compost
[01:04:01.290 --> 01:04:04.290]  because that's probably the single most...
[01:04:04.850 --> 01:04:10.850]  I've seen more pests and awful shit come in on contaminated compost.
[01:04:11.850 --> 01:04:14.850]  So the compost is the vector in that situation.
[01:04:15.850 --> 01:04:17.850]  Yeah, it is. Not only for herbicides and pesticides,
[01:04:18.850 --> 01:04:19.850]  a lot of things that...
[01:04:20.850 --> 01:04:21.850]  Will it show the pests or something like that?
[01:04:22.850 --> 01:04:23.850]  Absolutely. You get the wrong compost.
[01:04:24.850 --> 01:04:25.850]  Atritis, fusarium.
[01:04:26.850 --> 01:04:30.850]  Yeah. A lot of the bad fungi and a lot of problems
[01:04:31.410 --> 01:04:37.410]  can come from poorly sourced compost or just generally shitty practices
[01:04:38.410 --> 01:04:39.410]  when it comes to making compost.
[01:04:40.410 --> 01:04:42.410]  What about mushroom compost?
[01:04:43.410 --> 01:04:45.410]  I feel like that's something I've been playing around with the last few weeks.
[01:04:46.410 --> 01:04:47.410]  I love it. I think it's especially...
[01:04:48.410 --> 01:04:49.410]  A lot of people go one way or the other.
[01:04:50.410 --> 01:04:54.410]  They like mushroom compost that hasn't been used for growing mushrooms.
[01:04:55.410 --> 01:04:56.410]  I'm a huge...
[01:04:57.410 --> 01:04:59.410]  Yeah, it's going to be a little bit depleted from nutrition
[01:04:59.970 --> 01:05:03.970]  if you have a compost that's had mushrooms eat it already.
[01:05:04.970 --> 01:05:07.970]  But man, it is inoculated with all the fungus that you want.
[01:05:08.970 --> 01:05:12.970]  You get some oyster logs or get some compost that's got wood in it
[01:05:13.970 --> 01:05:15.970]  that has had a bunch of fungus digesting it,
[01:05:16.970 --> 01:05:18.970]  has all that mycorrhizae and all that good stuff in it.
[01:05:19.970 --> 01:05:23.970]  It eliminates you having to put that as an additive into your soil
[01:05:24.970 --> 01:05:25.970]  that's already there.
[01:05:26.530 --> 01:05:28.530]  And it's filled with things like chitin
[01:05:29.530 --> 01:05:31.530]  and all of the good things that mushroom provide.
[01:05:32.530 --> 01:05:33.530]  They are the world's digesters.
[01:05:34.530 --> 01:05:37.530]  They are the ultimate composters.
[01:05:38.530 --> 01:05:39.530]  Fungal world.
[01:05:40.530 --> 01:05:41.530]  Yeah, that's what they do.
[01:05:42.530 --> 01:05:47.530]  They live off of digesting stuff outside of their bodies
[01:05:48.530 --> 01:05:49.530]  and then bringing in the nutrition.
[01:05:50.530 --> 01:05:53.530]  So, fungal compost and mushroom compost is the way to go.
[01:05:54.090 --> 01:05:58.090]  If you had to pick one and only one, I would say that would be it.
[01:05:59.090 --> 01:06:02.090]  Yeah, and going out of your way to source a quality source, I think.
[01:06:03.090 --> 01:06:05.090]  Because once I started to get that fungal aspect
[01:06:06.090 --> 01:06:08.090]  where you can get that bouquet start to grow in your raised beds,
[01:06:09.090 --> 01:06:11.090]  I feel like that's when you can pat yourself on the back
[01:06:12.090 --> 01:06:16.090]  and start to be like, alright, soon my plants are going to show their full genetic expressions.
[01:06:17.090 --> 01:06:18.090]  I feel like when that starts to build up.
[01:06:19.090 --> 01:06:22.090]  And that's really the goal, I feel like, for all of us
[01:06:22.650 --> 01:06:26.650]  is to eventually get to where we're only cultivating with microbial world and water.
[01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:30.650]  Yeah, clean water is a big thing too.
[01:06:31.650 --> 01:06:32.650]  A lot of people overlook that.
[01:06:33.650 --> 01:06:34.650]  That's your world, bro.
[01:06:35.650 --> 01:06:37.650]  Like clean water is...
[01:06:38.650 --> 01:06:44.650]  I mean, you have any sort of tap water, even non-RO, filter water,
[01:06:45.650 --> 01:06:46.650]  anything in your process.
[01:06:47.650 --> 01:06:50.650]  Yeah, we highly promote it because we're seeing heavy metals and stuff.
[01:06:51.210 --> 01:06:52.210]  And other things come through.
[01:06:53.210 --> 01:06:54.210]  The water is a big carrier in everything.
[01:06:55.210 --> 01:06:58.210]  So I'm assuming, yeah, same way with cultivation as it is in ash making.
[01:06:59.210 --> 01:07:00.210]  It's just a big carrier.
[01:07:01.210 --> 01:07:02.210]  It's exactly the same.
[01:07:03.210 --> 01:07:04.210]  A lot of that stuff, if it's in your water, it's going to end up in the plant,
[01:07:05.210 --> 01:07:06.210]  it's going to end up in your ash.
[01:07:07.210 --> 01:07:09.210]  And clean water is step one.
[01:07:10.210 --> 01:07:14.210]  And then obviously have a system that does a lot of the work for you.
[01:07:15.210 --> 01:07:17.210]  Literally the first thing my grandpa taught me,
[01:07:17.770 --> 01:07:21.770]  when I sent him a photo of a plant just like kind of shriveling up.
[01:07:22.770 --> 01:07:26.770]  And he's known for organic gardening in general.
[01:07:27.770 --> 01:07:28.770]  And I'm like, what's happening to this plant?
[01:07:29.770 --> 01:07:31.770]  This is 20 years ago when I first moved to Colorado.
[01:07:32.770 --> 01:07:33.770]  He's like, well, what kind of water are you feeding it?
[01:07:34.770 --> 01:07:39.770]  I was like, tap water, you know, little 15, 16 year old, 17 year old,
[01:07:40.770 --> 01:07:41.770]  tap water.
[01:07:42.770 --> 01:07:43.770]  And he's like, there's a bunch of salt in that water.
[01:07:44.330 --> 01:07:47.330]  He's like, I'm taking all that salt and drying it out.
[01:07:48.330 --> 01:07:50.330]  So yeah, that was like literally the first little.
[01:07:51.330 --> 01:07:53.330]  Yeah, and TerraBot does a garden show, right?
[01:07:54.330 --> 01:07:56.330]  It does. Still does a garden show right now.
[01:07:57.330 --> 01:08:00.330]  Yeah, on KSFO, Bob Tannum in the Garden.
[01:08:01.330 --> 01:08:02.330]  It's like 8am on Sundays.
[01:08:03.330 --> 01:08:04.330]  Check it out.
[01:08:05.330 --> 01:08:09.330]  We should all tune in tomorrow morning.
[01:08:10.330 --> 01:08:11.330]  Yo, for real though, like send him some love.
[01:08:12.330 --> 01:08:13.330]  Tell him I said what's up.
[01:08:14.330 --> 01:08:15.330]  You don't really want to talk about ganja.
[01:08:16.330 --> 01:08:17.330]  It'll probably cut you.
[01:08:18.330 --> 01:08:20.330]  But you can still ask the same exact questions that we're talking about.
[01:08:21.330 --> 01:08:22.330]  As Greg mentioned, you know, in the beginning of this,
[01:08:23.330 --> 01:08:24.330]  you can ask the same questions.
[01:08:25.330 --> 01:08:26.330]  You just don't have to mention the term cannabis.
[01:08:27.330 --> 01:08:28.330]  Talk about you're growing your tomatoes or whatever.
[01:08:29.330 --> 01:08:30.330]  But he'll got you.
[01:08:31.330 --> 01:08:32.330]  Old school growth store stuff.
[01:08:33.330 --> 01:08:34.330]  Like I'm growing tomatoes and strawberries.
[01:08:35.330 --> 01:08:36.330]  I need this.
[01:08:37.330 --> 01:08:38.330]  There's a growth store literally in Aurora right here that was called the Big Tomato.
[01:08:39.330 --> 01:08:41.330]  You went in there, you'd get pissed and you'd say anything but tomato.
[01:08:41.890 --> 01:08:42.890]  Right?
[01:08:43.890 --> 01:08:44.890]  This is what you say.
[01:08:45.890 --> 01:08:48.890]  Speaking of water too, man, like here in Denver,
[01:08:49.890 --> 01:08:53.890]  there's water sources all over that are contaminated one way or the other.
[01:08:54.890 --> 01:08:57.890]  But there's been a big thing this summer with Denver Water and Lead.
[01:08:58.890 --> 01:09:01.890]  And they've been adjusting pH here.
[01:09:02.890 --> 01:09:03.890]  And a lot of people don't even know it.
[01:09:04.890 --> 01:09:09.890]  But you know, this water is coming out of the tap at like 10.5.
[01:09:10.450 --> 01:09:13.450]  I'm at 8 still, but it was higher than it was.
[01:09:14.450 --> 01:09:15.450]  It used to be at 7.
[01:09:16.450 --> 01:09:17.450]  Absolutely.
[01:09:18.450 --> 01:09:19.450]  Especially for us living soil growers.
[01:09:20.450 --> 01:09:21.450]  I don't even use my pH.
[01:09:22.450 --> 01:09:25.450]  It's something to pay attention to.
[01:09:26.450 --> 01:09:27.450]  Your source of water is really important.
[01:09:28.450 --> 01:09:30.450]  Even if you filter it, you're still going to have a super high pH.
[01:09:31.450 --> 01:09:35.450]  And obviously, in a living soil system, you know, your balance is pH itself.
[01:09:36.010 --> 01:09:40.010]  You always got to look at, you know, you go down the rabbit hole of bicarbonates
[01:09:41.010 --> 01:09:45.010]  and the way carbonates interact with your soil structure and how that affects pH.
[01:09:46.010 --> 01:09:48.010]  But really, your source of water matters.
[01:09:49.010 --> 01:09:52.010]  And for people that may not be paying attention,
[01:09:53.010 --> 01:09:57.010]  it's worth having a pH pen or be paying attention to your city water source
[01:09:58.010 --> 01:10:01.010]  if you're not using RO, which I don't.
[01:10:02.010 --> 01:10:03.010]  And a lot of us don't use RO.
[01:10:04.010 --> 01:10:05.010]  It's filtered water.
[01:10:06.010 --> 01:10:10.010]  I take my carbon, just a carbon-sensitive filter, like the little small boy or whatever.
[01:10:11.010 --> 01:10:12.010]  It definitely went up a little bit.
[01:10:13.010 --> 01:10:14.010]  For sure.
[01:10:15.010 --> 01:10:19.010]  I feel like it's like a catch-22 when there's chlorine and chloramine that's going into a living soil system.
[01:10:20.010 --> 01:10:25.010]  I was never really able to, I feel like, get everything to just become alive and thrive.
[01:10:26.010 --> 01:10:30.010]  As I like to say, and I feel like once I started to understand water on another level
[01:10:31.010 --> 01:10:34.010]  and get the filters, the charcoal filters, and start to experiment with that kind of stuff,
[01:10:34.570 --> 01:10:39.570]  adding oxygen to that system as well, which can kind of like boil off the chlorine.
[01:10:40.570 --> 01:10:41.570]  Yeah, yeah, because chlorine is gas.
[01:10:42.570 --> 01:10:43.570]  You know what I mean?
[01:10:44.570 --> 01:10:45.570]  That's how it exists in nature.
[01:10:46.570 --> 01:10:48.570]  And it's put in your water so that it can, literally, it's antimicrobial.
[01:10:49.570 --> 01:10:50.570]  So it's counterintuitive.
[01:10:51.570 --> 01:10:53.570]  In a living soil system, you're killing the biology that you're trying to build
[01:10:54.570 --> 01:10:55.570]  by adding water with chlorine.
[01:10:56.570 --> 01:10:59.570]  And chlorine doesn't boil off, or boil is the wrong term,
[01:11:00.570 --> 01:11:02.570]  but it doesn't gasify in the same way.
[01:11:03.130 --> 01:11:08.130]  So you just, you gotta, there's some filter systems that you really gotta pay attention to
[01:11:09.130 --> 01:11:12.130]  in living soil because those little things, you know what I mean?
[01:11:13.130 --> 01:11:14.130]  Makes a big difference, man.
[01:11:15.130 --> 01:11:16.130]  Well, all right.
[01:11:17.130 --> 01:11:20.130]  So for those of us just kind of like playing with the cards we're dealt with,
[01:11:21.130 --> 01:11:25.130]  I live in LA, and so I have LA municipal tap water.
[01:11:25.690 --> 01:11:32.690]  And usually I have all these, you know, everything from watering cans to,
[01:11:33.690 --> 01:11:36.690]  I basically fill everything with water and let it sit as long as possible
[01:11:37.690 --> 01:11:41.690]  to at least let some of that chlorine evaporate or whatever.
[01:11:42.690 --> 01:11:47.690]  But like, what else could someone who doesn't have access to, like a home grower, right?
[01:11:48.690 --> 01:11:51.690]  Like, what are some small things that are affordable that people could do
[01:11:52.250 --> 01:11:56.250]  to kind of clean up their water more so than just like letting it sit for 24 hours?
[01:11:57.250 --> 01:12:00.250]  Well, I mean, some water systems are good, you know?
[01:12:01.250 --> 01:12:03.250]  I mean, honestly, the first thing, and this sounds kind of corny,
[01:12:04.250 --> 01:12:07.250]  but like, get in touch with your water supplier.
[01:12:08.250 --> 01:12:10.250]  They all have water tests, so they can give you a water test and see what's in there.
[01:12:11.250 --> 01:12:14.250]  You know, and like, Colorado uses chloramine, but a lot of places don't use chloramine.
[01:12:15.250 --> 01:12:18.250]  So if it's just chlorine that you're dealing with, then, you know,
[01:12:18.810 --> 01:12:19.810]  you can let your water sit.
[01:12:20.810 --> 01:12:25.810]  You can also, like, the way that it works in the water systems is it attacks pathogens.
[01:12:26.810 --> 01:12:29.810]  So if you take, say, a handful of compost and throw it in your reservoir,
[01:12:30.810 --> 01:12:32.810]  you know, like literally tap water with chlorine in it,
[01:12:33.810 --> 01:12:37.810]  throw a handful of compost in there, that chlorine will free up from the water
[01:12:38.810 --> 01:12:41.810]  and try to attack, you know, and kill whatever is in the water.
[01:12:42.810 --> 01:12:43.810]  That's like how it works.
[01:12:44.810 --> 01:12:47.810]  Letting it sit, you know, bubbling it, you know, helps if you can aerate it.
[01:12:48.810 --> 01:12:52.810]  In any sort of way, it breaks it free, you know, but chloramine doesn't do that, you know.
[01:12:53.810 --> 01:12:55.810]  So it's like if you have chloramine in your water source, I mean,
[01:12:56.810 --> 01:12:59.810]  RO systems are one thing, but just a simple water filtration system,
[01:13:00.810 --> 01:13:05.810]  they're cheap and, you know, they're compact enough to where even a small home grower
[01:13:06.810 --> 01:13:11.810]  can get a small boy, you know, or a little bit of water filtration just to, you know,
[01:13:12.810 --> 01:13:16.810]  you get the chloramine filter that's in there, pay the extra 15 bucks or whatever it is
[01:13:17.370 --> 01:13:18.370]  to, you know, really clean your water up.
[01:13:19.370 --> 01:13:20.370]  It'll really make a difference.
[01:13:21.370 --> 01:13:25.370]  Now, I mean, if what you're going for is a hydro system or an aqua, you know,
[01:13:26.370 --> 01:13:28.370]  like aquaculture, deep water culture kind of system,
[01:13:29.370 --> 01:13:33.370]  that chlorine might be in your benefit, you know, it'll kill all those pathogens that could,
[01:13:34.370 --> 01:13:37.370]  you know, algae, yeah, yeah, the algae in the fusarium and all this, you know,
[01:13:38.370 --> 01:13:41.370]  root slimes and, you know, you don't get a lot of biofilms, you know,
[01:13:42.370 --> 01:13:44.370]  that are detrimental built up in water that has chlorine in it.
[01:13:44.930 --> 01:13:47.930]  So, you know, if you're a hydro grower or you're, you know,
[01:13:48.930 --> 01:13:51.930]  you're not concerned with the biology in your soil system or even, you know,
[01:13:52.930 --> 01:13:56.930]  in whatever system you're using, if biology is not, if, you know,
[01:13:57.930 --> 01:14:02.930]  the limiting factor, you know, then by all means, like, use what you got, you know,
[01:14:03.930 --> 01:14:05.930]  and if it's, you know, it could work out better, you know,
[01:14:06.930 --> 01:14:09.930]  you can keep a lot of pests and stuff away, you know, with, you know,
[01:14:10.490 --> 01:14:14.490]  good biology too, but, you know, bad biology with water with chlorine in it.
[01:14:15.490 --> 01:14:20.490]  So, you know, it kind of depends on your system, you know, like your plan of attack.
[01:14:25.620 --> 01:14:29.620]  I learned a simple trick from Chris Trump and he was saying for like,
[01:14:30.620 --> 01:14:32.620]  you know, if you have a five gallon bucket and that's filled with water
[01:14:33.620 --> 01:14:36.620]  and kind of left it out for a little bit, you can start with your hand
[01:14:37.620 --> 01:14:40.620]  and kind of get that going, that kind of like whirlpool effect.
[01:14:41.180 --> 01:14:42.180]  The vortex?
[01:14:42.180 --> 01:14:45.180]  The vortex and supposedly, I mean, I guess it kind of sucks,
[01:14:46.180 --> 01:14:48.180]  but the chlorine goes into your skin.
[01:14:49.180 --> 01:14:50.180]  I believe that.
[01:14:51.180 --> 01:14:54.180]  So if you're in a pinch, I guess you can kind of do it that way.
[01:14:55.180 --> 01:14:56.180]  It's a little bit.
[01:14:57.180 --> 01:14:58.180]  I mean, chlorinate yourself.
[01:14:59.180 --> 01:15:00.180]  It's in your skin anyways, though.
[01:15:01.180 --> 01:15:05.180]  Exactly. I mean, if I've been growing, I feel like all the amount of cheap,
[01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:09.180]  I don't want to say the brand name, but the cheap soil that bigger grows
[01:15:09.740 --> 01:15:13.740]  had for a long time that you were kind of taking the bag off and dumping it.
[01:15:14.740 --> 01:15:15.740]  Yeah. Yeah.
[01:15:16.740 --> 01:15:18.740]  I feel like chlorine is probably the least of.
[01:15:19.740 --> 01:15:20.740]  Agreed.
[01:15:21.740 --> 01:15:24.740]  So, yeah, in a pinch, man, five gallon bucket, just kind of spin that
[01:15:25.740 --> 01:15:26.740]  to a little vortex.
[01:15:27.740 --> 01:15:30.740]  I also back in the day, I remember we built like a little vortex
[01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:32.740]  from somebody on YouTube.
[01:15:33.740 --> 01:15:34.740]  I remember was teaching us.
[01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:37.740]  It's just like PVC pipe with a five gallon Eldorado bucket.
[01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:39.300]  Yeah.
[01:15:39.300 --> 01:15:40.300]  You can make a little video like that.
[01:15:41.300 --> 01:15:42.300]  Supposedly that's supposed to get rid of chlorine.
[01:15:43.300 --> 01:15:47.300]  And also there's a lot of biodynamic kind of principles that,
[01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:51.300]  you know, when you create that, you do vortex and you create that energy
[01:15:52.300 --> 01:15:54.300]  with the water, you know, there's a lot of cool studies coming out,
[01:15:55.300 --> 01:16:00.300]  you know, about water and like, you know, kind of the structure of water
[01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:03.300]  when you do this or that to it, you know, and supposedly, I mean,
[01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:07.300]  a lot of those old biodynamic heads, you know, like.
[01:16:08.300 --> 01:16:11.300]  Rudolf Steiner, you know, like in the 20s was talking about making
[01:16:12.300 --> 01:16:13.300]  the vortex like stirring it one way and stirring it the other,
[01:16:14.300 --> 01:16:19.300]  you know, just very basic, you know, aeration kind of agitation,
[01:16:20.300 --> 01:16:24.300]  you know, methods with your water that, I mean, change the water itself
[01:16:25.300 --> 01:16:27.300]  and really activate it to the, you know.
[01:16:28.300 --> 01:16:29.300]  Structured water.
[01:16:30.300 --> 01:16:31.300]  Yeah.
[01:16:31.300 --> 01:16:32.300]  Yeah.
[01:16:32.300 --> 01:16:33.300]  You know, well, that's what I was going to ask.
[01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:37.300]  Nick, have you ever washed in either structured or like.
[01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:42.300]  I haven't had enough of the variables to control it to really do
[01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:44.300]  the proper experiment.
[01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:46.300]  Yeah.
[01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:48.300]  It's just, you know, it always takes a lot.
[01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:51.300]  You know, you got to really designate the time with the same material
[01:16:52.300 --> 01:16:57.300]  and all the other factors the same, but then have also pressurized,
[01:16:58.300 --> 01:17:00.300]  you know, yeah.
[01:17:01.300 --> 01:17:03.300]  Alkaline water or acidic water.
[01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:05.300]  Yeah.
[01:17:05.300 --> 01:17:06.300]  I don't know.
[01:17:06.300 --> 01:17:07.300]  People have talked about it for sure.
[01:17:08.300 --> 01:17:09.300]  Variables.
[01:17:09.300 --> 01:17:11.300]  I haven't gone that route yet myself.
[01:17:12.300 --> 01:17:13.300]  Yeah.
[01:17:14.300 --> 01:17:15.300]  You meant that part.
[01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:19.300]  Yeah.
[01:17:19.300 --> 01:17:22.300]  So is the chat want to talk about something or should we talk about
[01:17:23.300 --> 01:17:24.300]  something amongst ourselves?
[01:17:25.300 --> 01:17:29.300]  Well, I think you need to take another hit while we look at the chat questions.
[01:17:30.300 --> 01:17:31.300]  Yeah.
[01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:36.300]  So a long time ago, I just want to get this one out there.
[01:17:36.860 --> 01:17:40.860]  Brian asked, and I assume this is like a lot of Colorado indoor growers.
[01:17:41.860 --> 01:17:42.860]  Do they supplement with CO2?
[01:17:43.860 --> 01:17:45.860]  Are you seeing that as a trend and like indoor?
[01:17:46.860 --> 01:17:47.860]  Yeah.
[01:17:47.860 --> 01:17:48.860]  I mean, I see greenhouse growers.
[01:17:49.860 --> 01:17:51.860]  You know, I see a lot of people that supplement CO2.
[01:17:52.860 --> 01:17:54.860]  I, you know, I will not lie.
[01:17:55.860 --> 01:17:58.860]  You know, when you when you're able to dial in your CO2, you can make your
[01:17:59.860 --> 01:18:03.860]  you can really dial in your your plants uptake and nutrition.
[01:18:04.420 --> 01:18:10.420]  And, you know, you can utilize a lot of the, you know, the life a lot better
[01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:15.420]  when your plant is, you know, when CO2 is not the limiting factor.
[01:18:16.420 --> 01:18:19.420]  You know, the plant is literally taking CO2 and water and making
[01:18:20.420 --> 01:18:21.420]  carbohydrates.
[01:18:21.420 --> 01:18:26.420]  So if you have good water and plenty excess of CO2 in your grow room, I
[01:18:27.420 --> 01:18:28.420]  mean, you can definitely boost yields.
[01:18:29.420 --> 01:18:33.420]  You can, you know, have your nutrition systems, you know, because
[01:18:34.420 --> 01:18:35.420]  it's going to be way more efficient for you.
[01:18:36.420 --> 01:18:41.420]  And yeah, I mean, most people that I know that are growing indoors are
[01:18:42.420 --> 01:18:44.420]  are definitely supplementing CO2.
[01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:49.420]  You know, whether that be from, you know, just the can, the bottle
[01:18:50.420 --> 01:18:53.420]  source or, you know, a lot of people use like those mushroom bags.
[01:18:54.420 --> 01:18:55.420]  I love those mushroom bags.
[01:18:56.420 --> 01:18:58.420]  They're easy for me because I don't want to deal with tanks and all that.
[01:18:59.420 --> 01:19:02.420]  It's a gift that keeps on giving because you can just compost it in your
[01:19:02.980 --> 01:19:04.980]  soil when they're done, you know, but I don't know that part.
[01:19:05.980 --> 01:19:06.980]  Yeah, I get kind of gnarly.
[01:19:07.980 --> 01:19:08.980]  They like turn crazy black and stuff.
[01:19:09.980 --> 01:19:10.980]  Yeah, they get spit.
[01:19:11.980 --> 01:19:14.980]  But yeah, I mean, CO2 is important for sure.
[01:19:15.980 --> 01:19:17.980]  And, you know, for most growers, it's probably something you should
[01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:19.980]  think about.
[01:19:20.980 --> 01:19:21.980]  You know, I don't know.
[01:19:22.980 --> 01:19:24.980]  There's a big debate about people say atmospheric is plenty, you know,
[01:19:25.980 --> 01:19:29.980]  for, you know, as long as you exchange fresh air and don't let your
[01:19:30.540 --> 01:19:32.540]  environment get too oxygenated because all your plants, then they should
[01:19:33.540 --> 01:19:34.540]  be not limited by CO2.
[01:19:35.540 --> 01:19:40.540]  But I've I've seen in every instance, people that have a thousand parts
[01:19:41.540 --> 01:19:44.540]  per million of CO2 will see their plants beast.
[01:19:45.540 --> 01:19:47.540]  I feel like it's the cherry on top.
[01:19:48.540 --> 01:19:50.540]  You have to have everything else dialed in.
[01:19:51.540 --> 01:19:52.540]  Yeah.
[01:19:52.540 --> 01:19:54.540]  And it's hard for someone, you know, like if you have a small homegrown,
[01:19:55.540 --> 01:19:58.540]  you don't have a bunch of air conditioning or say you are in a
[01:19:59.100 --> 01:20:02.100]  position where you have to filter your air constantly like like what I'm in.
[01:20:03.100 --> 01:20:06.100]  At my place, I'm like, I don't have AC in my grow.
[01:20:07.100 --> 01:20:09.100]  Just goes in a small little row.
[01:20:10.100 --> 01:20:13.100]  You know, it's like I don't have the power necessarily in my house to
[01:20:14.100 --> 01:20:16.100]  put a three ton unit in my room or whatever.
[01:20:17.100 --> 01:20:22.100]  So it's like I'm using fresh air and exhausting air to deal with
[01:20:23.100 --> 01:20:24.100]  temperatures in my place.
[01:20:25.100 --> 01:20:27.100]  So CO2 doesn't really make sense at all.
[01:20:27.660 --> 01:20:30.660]  You know, because literally I just get exhausted right out of the room
[01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:32.660]  and puts right in the atmosphere.
[01:20:33.660 --> 01:20:36.660]  And it's like I'm trying to reduce my greenhouse gas emissions, not just
[01:20:37.660 --> 01:20:38.660]  20 pounds of CO2 right out there.
[01:20:39.660 --> 01:20:40.660]  Plus, it's expensive.
[01:20:41.660 --> 01:20:42.660]  You know, I mean, six, seven bucks a bottle.
[01:20:43.660 --> 01:20:44.660]  You might go through a couple of those in a week.
[01:20:45.660 --> 01:20:47.660]  So it's, you know, if your system is dialed and it'll work for you,
[01:20:48.660 --> 01:20:49.660]  then I totally believe in it.
[01:20:50.660 --> 01:20:54.660]  But, you know, I don't I've seen some amazing, amazing cannabis come
[01:20:55.220 --> 01:20:58.220]  out of grows that don't supplement CO2 at all.
[01:20:59.220 --> 01:21:02.220]  So I had a little bro science back in the day where we would take when we
[01:21:03.220 --> 01:21:06.220]  had problems with our clones and our cuttings, we're trying to dial it in
[01:21:07.220 --> 01:21:08.220]  basically, especially using aloe vera.
[01:21:09.220 --> 01:21:11.220]  We would take the SodaStream.
[01:21:12.220 --> 01:21:13.220]  You guys remember those things?
[01:21:14.220 --> 01:21:15.220]  I got one of the three. I use it all the time.
[01:21:16.220 --> 01:21:17.220]  So all you need is that.
[01:21:18.220 --> 01:21:19.220]  And then I would use a little yucca extract for you guys out there.
[01:21:20.220 --> 01:21:21.220]  Spray that on the clone.
[01:21:22.220 --> 01:21:23.220]  So if you really have a problem, obviously cut the leaves in half.
[01:21:23.780 --> 01:21:24.780]  And that seems to dramatically improve.
[01:21:25.780 --> 01:21:26.780]  So just spray the clone dome.
[01:21:27.780 --> 01:21:29.780]  And that's CO2 that you've just sprayed in there.
[01:21:30.780 --> 01:21:31.780]  Perks up almost anything.
[01:21:32.780 --> 01:21:35.780]  And if you're having real issues, obviously kelp is probably plan B.
[01:21:36.780 --> 01:21:38.780]  And then plan C, I guess.
[01:21:39.780 --> 01:21:41.780]  It's time to research because cloning is right after a while.
[01:21:42.780 --> 01:21:43.780]  It should be pretty good.
[01:21:44.780 --> 01:21:47.780]  I was the clone master at like a number of places I've worked with.
[01:21:48.780 --> 01:21:50.780]  I want to share that because I feel like sometimes I've had issues
[01:21:51.340 --> 01:21:52.340]  throughout life in different environments.
[01:21:53.340 --> 01:21:55.340]  Yeah. I mean, cloning organically and not using root hormones
[01:21:56.340 --> 01:22:00.340]  and IVAs and stuff like that are synthetically derived.
[01:22:01.340 --> 01:22:03.340]  Has everyone learned how to take a cut with Clonex,
[01:22:04.340 --> 01:22:08.340]  dip it in the purple goo, and put it into whatever, rockwool or whatever?
[01:22:09.340 --> 01:22:10.340]  Super training wheels, I feel.
[01:22:11.340 --> 01:22:13.340]  Yeah. That's just like, you're going to get roots.
[01:22:14.340 --> 01:22:15.340]  But is that stuff healthy for you?
[01:22:16.340 --> 01:22:19.340]  No. Should a manufacturer get a big scale clone?
[01:22:19.900 --> 01:22:20.900]  Probably not.
[01:22:21.900 --> 01:22:25.900]  So for me, I'm like, step one is healthy parent stock.
[01:22:26.900 --> 01:22:29.900]  So when it comes to cloning, your veg plant's got to be healthy.
[01:22:30.900 --> 01:22:35.900]  And for me, I mean, at Blackbird Farms, the hemp farm that I ran last year
[01:22:36.900 --> 01:22:37.900]  and the year before, I mean, that's all we did.
[01:22:38.900 --> 01:22:39.900]  We were a cutting facility.
[01:22:40.900 --> 01:22:41.900]  We were hemp clone producers.
[01:22:42.900 --> 01:22:44.900]  So when you're taking 10, 15, 20,000 cuts at a time,
[01:22:45.460 --> 01:22:48.460]  doing the old dome method and dipping them in processes
[01:22:49.460 --> 01:22:52.460]  that take stupid amounts of time.
[01:22:53.460 --> 01:22:56.460]  So for me, healthy mother stock, nothing else.
[01:22:57.460 --> 01:22:58.460]  I don't dip in anything.
[01:22:59.460 --> 01:23:00.460]  I don't soak it with anything.
[01:23:01.460 --> 01:23:04.460]  Literally no aloe vera, no yucca, no nothing.
[01:23:05.460 --> 01:23:08.460]  And we're 95% success.
[01:23:09.460 --> 01:23:13.460]  And because you're not adding any, there's nothing but clean water
[01:23:14.020 --> 01:23:15.020]  that you're giving to these plants.
[01:23:16.020 --> 01:23:20.020]  Like you really don't deal with any rotting off or fungal issues.
[01:23:21.020 --> 01:23:25.020]  I mean, aside from the medium occasionally.
[01:23:26.020 --> 01:23:27.020]  If I would have been doing the same method in rockwool,
[01:23:28.020 --> 01:23:32.020]  I probably never would have seen a single fungal issue.
[01:23:33.020 --> 01:23:36.020]  Most of what came in on our pea clone pucks
[01:23:37.020 --> 01:23:40.020]  or something like that sat in the warehouse for too long.
[01:23:40.580 --> 01:23:45.580]  And you get some fungus there, but on that scale, you're still using domes?
[01:23:46.580 --> 01:23:47.580]  No domes.
[01:23:48.580 --> 01:23:49.580]  He's super humid.
[01:23:50.580 --> 01:23:52.580]  I mean, at that point, it's like you literally just dial in the humidity.
[01:23:53.580 --> 01:23:55.580]  At that point, you got to make your entire greenhouse the dome,
[01:23:56.580 --> 01:23:58.580]  because there is no pulling the dome off and put it back on.
[01:23:59.580 --> 01:24:01.580]  I'm talking like hundreds of thousands of dollars of labor.
[01:24:02.580 --> 01:24:08.580]  It's one person's full-time job to pull domes and put domes back on 50,000 clones.
[01:24:09.140 --> 01:24:15.140]  We had the leaf where basically depending on how much moisture is sitting on it,
[01:24:16.140 --> 01:24:20.140]  if there's not enough moisture and it's at the level of all the clones,
[01:24:21.140 --> 01:24:27.140]  it'll mist them all until that leaf gets enough moisture on it to stop the mister.
[01:24:28.140 --> 01:24:29.140]  Yeah. Okay.
[01:24:30.140 --> 01:24:32.140]  There's lots of ways that little environmental controllers
[01:24:33.140 --> 01:24:37.140]  or moisture meters and stuff like that you can use to get that done.
[01:24:37.700 --> 01:24:41.700]  But yeah, we would literally take cuts and I wouldn't stick them immediately.
[01:24:42.700 --> 01:24:43.700]  I would leave them out.
[01:24:44.700 --> 01:24:50.700]  I put them in water and leave them out for 24 hours and then stick them.
[01:24:51.700 --> 01:24:56.700]  And at that point, they're not stressed in the same way when they first come off the plant.
[01:24:57.700 --> 01:24:58.700]  And they don't wilt.
[01:24:59.700 --> 01:25:01.700]  You get none of that clone wilt and anything like that.
[01:25:02.700 --> 01:25:03.700]  They're literally in the water for 24 hours.
[01:25:04.260 --> 01:25:11.260]  Yeah. Big horticultural cutting, people that do hundreds of thousands of geranium cuttings
[01:25:12.260 --> 01:25:14.260]  or rosemary cuttings or whatever, they don't even put them in water.
[01:25:15.260 --> 01:25:18.260]  They take these cuts and they put them in the cooler for 24 to 72 hours.
[01:25:19.260 --> 01:25:23.260]  Literally just bare cuts and the cuts callous off in the air.
[01:25:24.260 --> 01:25:27.260]  And then when you put them in the medium, they're just trying to root.
[01:25:28.260 --> 01:25:32.260]  They're not going through that stress of trying to heal the cut that you just took
[01:25:32.820 --> 01:25:33.820]  before trying to root.
[01:25:34.820 --> 01:25:37.820]  So you see drastic success by doing that.
[01:25:38.820 --> 01:25:39.820]  I couldn't get that method to work with cannabis.
[01:25:40.820 --> 01:25:41.820]  I've literally tried.
[01:25:42.820 --> 01:25:46.820]  I've literally cut the cuts, put them in a cooler and then put them in a walk-in refrigerator
[01:25:47.820 --> 01:25:49.820]  for 24 to 48 hours.
[01:25:50.820 --> 01:25:54.820]  And I didn't, I mean, the plants didn't wilt, but I didn't see as good of rooting success
[01:25:55.820 --> 01:25:56.820]  when I did that.
[01:25:57.820 --> 01:25:59.820]  Maybe some of the, another plant you would see, you know what I mean?
[01:26:00.380 --> 01:26:06.380]  But I had nearly a hundred percent success and no wilt if I left the cut for 24 hours
[01:26:07.380 --> 01:26:10.380]  after I took it before sticking it in the medium.
[01:26:11.380 --> 01:26:12.380]  So we would like prep our cuts, you know what I mean?
[01:26:13.380 --> 01:26:16.380]  One day we'd be sticking the cuts that we took the previous day, you know,
[01:26:17.380 --> 01:26:19.380]  and it just kind of gets into a workflow like that, you know.
[01:26:20.380 --> 01:26:24.380]  And I had great success, you know, on, at scale, you know, when you start talking,
[01:26:25.380 --> 01:26:27.380]  you know, taking over the cuts, you know what I mean?
[01:26:27.940 --> 01:26:28.940]  Well, that's what I was going to ask you.
[01:26:29.940 --> 01:26:32.940]  You just said it was, it was a hemp farm you've been running for the past two years.
[01:26:33.940 --> 01:26:37.940]  So that's like, I feel like hemp is big boy compared to cannabis in terms of.
[01:26:38.940 --> 01:26:40.940]  Yeah, well, I mean, even the, you know, there's these big farms, you know,
[01:26:41.940 --> 01:26:44.940]  like big outdoor farms and stuff, you know, here in Pueblo, Colorado, you know,
[01:26:45.940 --> 01:26:48.940]  people that got 25 acres of outdoor, you know, like they're going to need big clone pushes
[01:26:49.940 --> 01:26:50.940]  at certain times.
[01:26:51.940 --> 01:26:53.940]  And, you know, you don't, a lot of people don't have, you know,
[01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:57.500]  30,000 square feet of space to propagate, you know,
[01:26:58.500 --> 01:27:00.500]  a hundred thousand clones when you need a hundred thousand plants, you know?
[01:27:01.500 --> 01:27:04.500]  So it's, it's a totally, it's just a scale up kind of issue, you know,
[01:27:05.500 --> 01:27:07.500]  like when you're, when you're dealing with just domes for the home grower,
[01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:09.500]  like by all means, like give them all the love, you know,
[01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:12.500]  like put the dome on, check them every day, you know,
[01:27:13.500 --> 01:27:16.500]  like give them some aloe or some, you know, give them some love, you know.
[01:27:17.500 --> 01:27:19.500]  I feel like you're spitting bars right now for people that are really trying to
[01:27:20.500 --> 01:27:22.500]  take their growth to the next level that are probably,
[01:27:23.060 --> 01:27:26.060]  I'm not going to have to, they're really listening to what you're saying right now.
[01:27:27.060 --> 01:27:31.060]  I think you just helped a dramatic amount of people out there to try to take
[01:27:32.060 --> 01:27:34.060]  their growth to the next level that they're commercially farmed.
[01:27:35.060 --> 01:27:37.060]  I mean, it's worked for me, you know, I'm not saying my method's the best,
[01:27:38.060 --> 01:27:42.060]  but it's worked. And I know when you start to go at scale,
[01:27:43.060 --> 01:27:44.060]  you got to look at other industries.
[01:27:45.060 --> 01:27:47.060]  And I think us cannabis folks are really kind of,
[01:27:48.060 --> 01:27:50.060]  we're really narrow sided a lot of times. We want to ask, you know,
[01:27:50.620 --> 01:27:53.620]  we want to go to a cannabis growth shop and ask about growing weed, you know,
[01:27:54.620 --> 01:27:56.620]  or like not search other, you know,
[01:27:57.620 --> 01:28:00.620]  plants are going to deal with nutritional deficiencies or whatever in other
[01:28:01.620 --> 01:28:02.620]  industries, you know, it's like across the board,
[01:28:03.620 --> 01:28:04.620]  a lot of these things are the same, you know,
[01:28:05.620 --> 01:28:07.620]  calcium or nitrogen deficiency or whatever.
[01:28:08.620 --> 01:28:12.620]  And it's sort of, it's in our benefit to like, once again,
[01:28:13.620 --> 01:28:16.620]  diversity, diversify our sources of information and really ask people,
[01:28:17.180 --> 01:28:20.180]  you know, that are not in cannabis,
[01:28:21.180 --> 01:28:25.180]  but are in plant horticulture, what they're doing for a particular thing,
[01:28:26.180 --> 01:28:28.180]  you know, hit up grams. Yeah. I mean, literally
[01:28:29.180 --> 01:28:34.180]  same kind of thing, you know, like a lot of old heads got a lot of tricks,
[01:28:35.180 --> 01:28:37.180]  you know, that will work for cannabis that have worked for,
[01:28:38.180 --> 01:28:41.180]  you know, corn or soy or some other commercial at scale crop,
[01:28:42.180 --> 01:28:46.180]  big ag, whatever for years, you know, and, you know,
[01:28:47.180 --> 01:28:50.180]  it's in our benefit to really step outside of that, you know,
[01:28:51.180 --> 01:28:54.180]  the relatively small cannabis community, you know,
[01:28:55.180 --> 01:28:56.180]  comparatively, you know,
[01:28:57.180 --> 01:29:01.180]  you even grow bro asked what's he sticking the clones into.
[01:29:02.180 --> 01:29:04.180]  So once you're ready to root them, what do you, what do you,
[01:29:05.180 --> 01:29:07.180]  at scale, like when you're doing the hemp stuff,
[01:29:08.180 --> 01:29:11.180]  I like, I like Pete personally. So, um, I,
[01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:15.180]  I've had the best success in, um, like the preformed trays.
[01:29:15.740 --> 01:29:18.740]  So you buy a 72 side tray that already has the, um,
[01:29:19.740 --> 01:29:23.740]  the pucks in them. Um, and you just hide, you usually come hydrated,
[01:29:24.740 --> 01:29:25.740]  but you know, when you have five pallets of them and like,
[01:29:26.740 --> 01:29:28.740]  you finally get to the bottom of that fifth pallet, you know,
[01:29:29.740 --> 01:29:31.740]  like, so you might need to rehydrate them, you know, but, um, you know,
[01:29:32.740 --> 01:29:33.740]  I prefer Pete, a lot of people, you know,
[01:29:34.740 --> 01:29:36.740]  I've had great success in just raw cocoa, you know,
[01:29:37.740 --> 01:29:41.740]  taking a 70 seat, 72 side tray and, you know, stuff it with cocoa, um,
[01:29:42.300 --> 01:29:46.300]  raw, you know, cocoa, and then cloning that I've had great success with that.
[01:29:47.300 --> 01:29:52.300]  Um, I think when it comes to cloning, uh, the more like popping seeds is different,
[01:29:53.300 --> 01:29:56.300]  but when it comes to cloning, like actually having a pretty sterile or
[01:29:57.300 --> 01:30:00.300]  close sterile medium to clone into is going to, you know,
[01:30:01.300 --> 01:30:04.300]  really help your success. Rockwell's great. I just, um,
[01:30:05.300 --> 01:30:09.300]  for a rooting success, but it just never goes away. Um, and so I don't,
[01:30:09.860 --> 01:30:12.860]  it's something that like I'm finding Rockwell cubes from when I first got
[01:30:13.860 --> 01:30:17.860]  clones, you know, like in soil beds that I've been growing in for 10 years,
[01:30:18.860 --> 01:30:21.860]  like still see the cube, it's perfectly formed. It's like not digested at all.
[01:30:22.860 --> 01:30:24.860]  So I don't recommend that if you're kind of more on the environmental
[01:30:25.860 --> 01:30:30.860]  conscious side, but when it comes to being sterile and completely, um,
[01:30:31.860 --> 01:30:35.860]  you know, devoid of any sort of anything, you know, um, it's a good medium.
[01:30:36.860 --> 01:30:38.860]  So more sterile, the better I would never recommend somebody taking a clone
[01:30:39.860 --> 01:30:43.860]  from like living soil or anything. That's even, you know, uh,
[01:30:44.860 --> 01:30:47.860]  even a seedling mix that maybe has 25% compost or something in it.
[01:30:48.860 --> 01:30:51.860]  I just have not had great success doing that. Now I'm sure there's people
[01:30:52.860 --> 01:30:54.860]  that have, but you know, popping seeds, obviously I put it directly
[01:30:55.860 --> 01:30:57.860]  into the soil that I'm going to grow it in. But when it comes to,
[01:30:58.860 --> 01:31:03.860]  you know, getting a clone, you kind of need a pathogen free environment
[01:31:04.860 --> 01:31:08.860]  to really, to really be successful, I think. Um, so I use Pete, um,
[01:31:09.860 --> 01:31:12.860]  preformed, you know, I love rapid rooters. Um, they just get really
[01:31:13.860 --> 01:31:15.860]  expensive at scale. So, you know, you can go through some other,
[01:31:16.860 --> 01:31:18.860]  you know, proforma, you know, Jiffy, there's a lot of places, you know,
[01:31:19.860 --> 01:31:22.860]  companies that make, um, you know, at pallet levels and you don't have
[01:31:23.860 --> 01:31:26.860]  to do anything. It's already in your tray. Um, so that's what I like,
[01:31:27.860 --> 01:31:30.860]  you know, a hundred percent Pete, um, 50, 50 cocoa and PME,
[01:31:31.860 --> 01:31:34.860]  there's a million options out there for what you can do. So just,
[01:31:35.860 --> 01:31:37.860]  uh, you know, whatever works for your system, you know,
[01:31:38.420 --> 01:31:41.420]  and I try to mimic, you know, what's your, if you're growing in rock,
[01:31:42.420 --> 01:31:44.420]  we'll obviously take your clones in rock. Well, you know,
[01:31:45.420 --> 01:31:48.420]  if you're going to put it into a cocoa system, maybe cloning in cocoa
[01:31:49.420 --> 01:31:52.420]  works for you, you know, and I kind of reduce the stress on the plant,
[01:31:53.420 --> 01:31:56.420]  you know, versus taking rooting in cocoa and then putting it in a Pete
[01:31:57.420 --> 01:32:00.420]  or rooting in rock wool and then, you know, putting it into, you know,
[01:32:01.420 --> 01:32:03.420]  living soil or something like that, you know, so that's,
[01:32:04.420 --> 01:32:06.420]  that would be my advice. I don't know. That's worked for me.
[01:32:06.980 --> 01:32:07.980]  Solid.
[01:32:08.980 --> 01:32:11.980]  Digital D asked, uh, in living soil,
[01:32:12.980 --> 01:32:15.980]  does amending with an organic fertilizer, like a two, eight,
[01:32:16.980 --> 01:32:20.980]  four in flower suppress the microbiology we're trying to colonize.
[01:32:21.980 --> 01:32:23.980]  I've been hesitant to use hesitant to use them.
[01:32:24.980 --> 01:32:25.980]  I assume that means the fertilizers.
[01:32:26.980 --> 01:32:29.980]  I mean, it's, uh, you could probably speak to this too,
[01:32:30.980 --> 01:32:34.980]  but I feel like it's, um, all depends on what's derived from it.
[01:32:35.540 --> 01:32:39.540]  Um, you know, any sort of chelated, um, excuse me, um,
[01:32:40.540 --> 01:32:44.540]  chelated organic stuff, you know, like a lot of organic acids, um,
[01:32:45.540 --> 01:32:48.540]  or something like that might be detrimental to your biology.
[01:32:49.540 --> 01:32:51.540]  Um, I generally don't amend with fertilizer.
[01:32:52.540 --> 01:32:55.540]  Um, if I'm going to add any fertilizer, I'll do it, um,
[01:32:56.540 --> 01:32:57.540]  as a liquid feed later on.
[01:32:58.540 --> 01:33:02.540]  I feel like unless you have a soil mixer or something that you're,
[01:33:03.100 --> 01:33:04.100]  when you're trying to put into your soil,
[01:33:05.100 --> 01:33:06.100]  you're going to get pockets of fertilizers.
[01:33:07.100 --> 01:33:08.100]  There's really no way to get it really homogenized.
[01:33:09.100 --> 01:33:12.100]  So, um, I mean, yes and no,
[01:33:13.100 --> 01:33:15.100]  depending on what your fertilizer is, it may disrupt your biology.
[01:33:16.100 --> 01:33:19.100]  Um, it might not, depending on what it's derived from,
[01:33:20.100 --> 01:33:22.100]  you know, some of these fertilizers, organic, you know,
[01:33:23.100 --> 01:33:25.100]  USD organic fertilizer, whatever, um,
[01:33:26.100 --> 01:33:28.100]  may or may not be made to amend in your soil.
[01:33:29.100 --> 01:33:31.100]  You know, a lot of the ones that are really soluble,
[01:33:31.660 --> 01:33:34.660]  um, you know, are water soluble are not good necessarily to,
[01:33:35.660 --> 01:33:38.660]  to amend directly in your soil because they'll just wash right out
[01:33:39.660 --> 01:33:40.660]  or you'll solubilize them.
[01:33:41.660 --> 01:33:43.660]  And then, you know, if it's anything that can burn
[01:33:44.660 --> 01:33:46.660]  or super available to your plant, you might, you know,
[01:33:47.660 --> 01:33:49.660]  see some lockout or something like that.
[01:33:50.660 --> 01:33:52.660]  So, um, I would just be careful, you know,
[01:33:53.660 --> 01:33:55.660]  know what your inputs are, um, before just, you know,
[01:33:56.660 --> 01:33:57.660]  mixing it into your soil.
[01:33:58.660 --> 01:34:00.660]  I would, you know, start, start with a mix of fertilizer.
[01:34:01.660 --> 01:34:04.660]  Start slow, you know, maybe try one pot or something,
[01:34:05.660 --> 01:34:07.660]  see if it works good, you know, see once again,
[01:34:08.660 --> 01:34:10.660]  if you have a microscope, look, see if it messed with your biology,
[01:34:11.660 --> 01:34:13.660]  you know, or the, I don't know, microbiome or whatever,
[01:34:14.660 --> 01:34:15.660]  you know, there's some other, um,
[01:34:16.660 --> 01:34:18.660]  there's a lot of different tools, a lot of tools you can use to see your biology
[01:34:19.660 --> 01:34:20.660]  and kind of do the test. You know, I would,
[01:34:21.660 --> 01:34:22.660]  Praying Head is the ultimate test.
[01:34:23.660 --> 01:34:25.660]  You know, if that's going on, I wouldn't touch a thing.
[01:34:26.660 --> 01:34:27.660]  Right.
[01:34:28.660 --> 01:34:30.660]  Keep chugging along for sure.
[01:34:31.660 --> 01:34:36.660]  Uh, Al asked, uh, and let's take the Colorado market specifically.
[01:34:37.660 --> 01:34:41.660]  What would you guys like to see in the legal industry that hasn't happened?
[01:34:42.660 --> 01:34:44.660]  Uh, and I guess specifically in retail, like,
[01:34:45.660 --> 01:34:46.660]  is there anything that frustrates you?
[01:34:49.660 --> 01:34:51.660]  I mean, there's probably a lot, but
[01:34:52.660 --> 01:34:54.660]  lack of bud tender knowledge.
[01:34:55.660 --> 01:34:56.660]  I'm not gonna lie. I don't shop.
[01:34:57.220 --> 01:34:58.220]  Between the cultivation and the retail.
[01:34:59.220 --> 01:35:00.220]  Um, I don't know.
[01:35:01.220 --> 01:35:02.220]  There's a lot, but yeah,
[01:35:03.220 --> 01:35:04.220]  I would like to see more living soil flower on the shelf.
[01:35:05.220 --> 01:35:06.220]  You know, I know that there's a,
[01:35:07.220 --> 01:35:09.220]  the people that are doing living soil here in Colorado.
[01:35:10.220 --> 01:35:11.220]  Um, a lot of them are extractors.
[01:35:12.220 --> 01:35:14.220]  So, you know, they're making really, really good hash, but,
[01:35:15.220 --> 01:35:17.220]  um, you know, a lot of that flower is really hard to come by.
[01:35:18.220 --> 01:35:20.220]  I mean, you've managed to get some seven, 10 flower here and there,
[01:35:21.220 --> 01:35:23.220]  but you know, um, so a lot of this,
[01:35:24.220 --> 01:35:25.220]  I don't know, I don't know if it's a good thing,
[01:35:25.780 --> 01:35:26.780]  but a lot of this, uh,
[01:35:27.780 --> 01:35:28.780]  I don't even know if that's living.
[01:35:29.780 --> 01:35:30.780]  So I think that few gardens, I think I've had a few.
[01:35:31.780 --> 01:35:32.780]  I guess I would like to see if I was going to say one thing,
[01:35:33.780 --> 01:35:34.780]  I would like to see a lot more, you know, kind of.
[01:35:36.780 --> 01:35:37.780]  Just.
[01:35:38.780 --> 01:35:40.780]  I don't want to say non-commercial because it is commercial,
[01:35:41.780 --> 01:35:42.780]  but the flower that isn't, yeah.
[01:35:43.780 --> 01:35:47.780]  Boutique weeds, you know, like the shelves in Colorado are a fucking joke.
[01:35:48.780 --> 01:35:50.780]  You know, like a lot of this weed, especially now there's like a drought in Colorado.
[01:35:51.780 --> 01:35:54.780]  I mean, there's like just super low quality cannabis, you know,
[01:35:55.780 --> 01:35:56.780]  pretty much across the board.
[01:35:57.780 --> 01:35:58.780]  It's hard to find good weed.
[01:35:59.780 --> 01:36:00.780]  You know, I don't, I don't go to dispensaries that much.
[01:36:01.780 --> 01:36:02.780]  I'm pretty stocked, you know, but I know a lot of people that do,
[01:36:03.780 --> 01:36:05.780]  and I see their jars of flower and then, you know, I'm just like, wow,
[01:36:06.780 --> 01:36:10.780]  like this is, this wouldn't even be marketable flower in some places.
[01:36:11.780 --> 01:36:12.780]  And it's, it's there.
[01:36:13.780 --> 01:36:14.780]  So I would, you know, short answer,
[01:36:15.780 --> 01:36:18.780]  I would love to see just better quality weed on the shelf, you know,
[01:36:19.780 --> 01:36:23.780]  um, stuff that just people that took the time and the care to really like
[01:36:24.340 --> 01:36:27.340]  bring a super high quality boutique flower product to the market,
[01:36:28.340 --> 01:36:34.340]  not over-trimmed or over-dried or been touched by 30 different surfaces before,
[01:36:35.340 --> 01:36:36.340]  you know, I mean, the regulated market here in Colorado is kind of,
[01:36:37.340 --> 01:36:39.340]  it's hard, but, you know, um,
[01:36:40.340 --> 01:36:46.340]  I think there's lots and lots of room for super high quality weed to still make it to the shelf.
[01:36:47.340 --> 01:36:48.340]  And unfortunately...
[01:36:48.900 --> 01:36:53.900]  For your own weed, not in the retail, but just for yourself,
[01:36:54.900 --> 01:36:57.900]  do you like a kind of a loose, a medium or a tight trim?
[01:36:58.900 --> 01:37:00.900]  I think it's super strain specific personally.
[01:37:01.900 --> 01:37:02.900]  I mean, for me, I don't know if you guys probably got some preference.
[01:37:03.900 --> 01:37:04.900]  That's a great answer. No.
[01:37:05.900 --> 01:37:09.900]  I mean, when you're talking about some of these super like nodularly hazes that want to go 130 days,
[01:37:10.900 --> 01:37:12.900]  like, yeah, you want to trim it a little bit looser.
[01:37:13.900 --> 01:37:16.900]  Cause if you trim it just as tight as your Audrey, you're not going to have much left.
[01:37:17.460 --> 01:37:21.460]  You got some of these land race type strains that are like, yeah, real fingery, if you will.
[01:37:22.460 --> 01:37:23.460]  Totally.
[01:37:24.460 --> 01:37:31.460]  I mean, I think it's just middle to, you know, I don't, I generally trim at least, you know, some,
[01:37:32.460 --> 01:37:35.460]  you know, I don't really put non-trimmed flower in my jar that often.
[01:37:36.460 --> 01:37:39.460]  Um, but you know, I think it's definitely strain specific.
[01:37:40.460 --> 01:37:41.460]  I mean, what about you? What do you like to see?
[01:37:42.460 --> 01:37:43.460]  You like really tight trim?
[01:37:44.460 --> 01:37:45.460]  If it's bag appeal, that's what you're going for.
[01:37:46.020 --> 01:37:49.020]  If you're trying to hang out with the homies and you give them a little extra sugar leaf.
[01:37:50.020 --> 01:37:51.020]  Yeah.
[01:37:51.020 --> 01:37:52.020]  That's what I was saying.
[01:37:53.020 --> 01:37:57.020]  Like forget the retail and the requirements for presentation there just for like yourself.
[01:37:58.020 --> 01:38:02.020]  I mean, I personally like kind of like a medium loose trim.
[01:38:03.020 --> 01:38:08.020]  Cause in reality, before I roll everything up and before I roll it up, I'm pulling off like the stocks
[01:38:09.020 --> 01:38:10.020]  and the stems and the leaves anyways.
[01:38:11.020 --> 01:38:15.020]  I think it adds a little protection, maybe helps that cure keeps a little bit more moisture.
[01:38:16.020 --> 01:38:17.020]  Um, I don't know.
[01:38:18.020 --> 01:38:19.020]  There's a lot of variables though.
[01:38:20.020 --> 01:38:22.020]  You know, some herb I want a super tight trim on it.
[01:38:23.020 --> 01:38:25.020]  Like told me on some of those gushers, got a really tight trim on it.
[01:38:26.020 --> 01:38:27.020]  Yeah.
[01:38:27.020 --> 01:38:28.020]  I mean, it looks great.
[01:38:29.020 --> 01:38:32.020]  It's like, you know, I tend to think like purple weed, you know, if it's purple at all, tight trim it.
[01:38:33.020 --> 01:38:36.020]  You know, like it's just purple and green leaf.
[01:38:37.020 --> 01:38:38.020]  Like just, yeah.
[01:38:38.020 --> 01:38:39.020]  There's something about it.
[01:38:40.020 --> 01:38:41.020]  Yeah.
[01:38:41.020 --> 01:38:43.020]  It always looks like those extra green leaves are like too dried up.
[01:38:44.020 --> 01:38:45.020]  Yeah.
[01:38:45.580 --> 01:38:54.580]  So, um, yeah, as long as, you know, as long as it looks good and it smokes good, you know, then whatever.
[01:38:55.580 --> 01:38:58.580]  I don't mind picking up a little bit of leaf before I roll it up or whatever too.
[01:38:59.580 --> 01:39:02.580]  And I would say back in the day, some people would prefer that.
[01:39:03.580 --> 01:39:04.580]  Right.
[01:39:04.580 --> 01:39:05.580]  And then other people would be offended.
[01:39:05.580 --> 01:39:07.580]  So it was almost like their preferences, how I would trim it for them.
[01:39:08.580 --> 01:39:09.580]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:39:10.580 --> 01:39:14.580]  That's once again, you got to kind of read your, read your market a little bit, you know, as well.
[01:39:15.580 --> 01:39:21.580]  Some, some guys even liked it because then they can trim that off and roll up some blunts with it while they were doing their thing.
[01:39:22.580 --> 01:39:23.580]  Yeah.
[01:39:23.580 --> 01:39:24.580]  A little extra, whatever.
[01:39:24.580 --> 01:39:25.580]  Go.
[01:39:25.580 --> 01:39:26.580]  However it went.
[01:39:26.580 --> 01:39:27.580]  That's all I get.
[01:39:27.580 --> 01:39:28.580]  Totally.
[01:39:28.580 --> 01:39:29.580]  Yeah.
[01:39:29.580 --> 01:39:30.580]  I think quality has always been paramount.
[01:39:31.580 --> 01:39:38.580]  I mean, we used to say to even the students and stuff like that, would you always want to try to hustle three or have somebody willing to prepay you for two?
[01:39:39.580 --> 01:39:40.580]  Right.
[01:39:41.140 --> 01:39:42.140]  Yeah.
[01:39:42.140 --> 01:39:44.140]  I mean, we really been about that for a long time.
[01:39:45.140 --> 01:39:48.140]  I've personally shared about how like that would mess with my stomach.
[01:39:49.140 --> 01:39:50.140]  I would get bubble guts.
[01:39:51.140 --> 01:39:53.140]  I would have a lot of stress where I feel like that was the first time I felt anxiety.
[01:39:54.140 --> 01:39:56.140]  You know, that's a lot to do for an easy life.
[01:39:57.140 --> 01:39:58.140]  Yeah.
[01:39:58.140 --> 01:40:05.140]  I mean, we got a lot riding on your, your crop, you know, it's like you really got to, you know, focus on, you know, it's a balance.
[01:40:05.700 --> 01:40:12.700]  It's a balance between, you know, what your market wants and what you are able to provide.
[01:40:15.700 --> 01:40:17.700]  We have to talk about a crisp here.
[01:40:18.700 --> 01:40:20.700]  I want to hear business models.
[01:40:21.700 --> 01:40:22.700]  No, I'm sitting there.
[01:40:23.700 --> 01:40:25.700]  I want to hear, I want to talk business models.
[01:40:26.700 --> 01:40:31.700]  Cause like Nick, I see you, like I see essential extracts popping up in multiple states.
[01:40:32.260 --> 01:40:40.260]  Is it like, are you, are you creating like partnerships state by state?
[01:40:41.260 --> 01:40:47.260]  And then Greg, are you like, is breeding like you're managing facilities, but then you're also breeding.
[01:40:48.260 --> 01:40:56.260]  So kind of what's the, like, what's the vision for a year or two out for both of you in terms of your business moving and shaking?
[01:40:56.820 --> 01:40:57.820]  Yeah.
[01:40:57.820 --> 01:41:03.820]  I mean, me personally, I've been doing a lot of licensing deals, consulting or coupled with consulting arrangements.
[01:41:04.820 --> 01:41:10.820]  And I mean, I'd love to do those in every single state, basically where I go out.
[01:41:11.820 --> 01:41:21.820]  I'm also helping with the build outs, the design, the flow of material, the equipment lists, making sure that the QC is there by going out and actually training the employees, sharing those SOPs,
[01:41:22.380 --> 01:41:30.380]  continuing that QC by going out quarterly, if not more regularly to a lot of these facilities as we come online.
[01:41:31.380 --> 01:41:32.380]  That's my goal.
[01:41:32.380 --> 01:41:36.380]  I'd like to get into all the licensed legal states that I can.
[01:41:37.380 --> 01:41:46.380]  And then, and then are those typically like revenue share deals or what, what are kind of, what's a typical deal structure to roll out kind of licensee state by state?
[01:41:47.380 --> 01:41:48.380]  Everything's a little bit different.
[01:41:48.940 --> 01:41:50.940]  I'm not going to really get into the specifics.
[01:41:51.940 --> 01:41:56.940]  You can definitely hit me on, you know, the private messages, the specific deals.
[01:41:57.940 --> 01:41:59.940]  I got to ask publicly because you may answer.
[01:42:00.940 --> 01:42:08.940]  Yeah, no, but generally speaking, it's like licensing deal that has a running royalty, there's consulting.
[01:42:09.940 --> 01:42:15.940]  And then if there was to be an exclusive deal for that state, then there would be some type of exclusivity fee.
[01:42:16.500 --> 01:42:19.500]  Generally speaking, that's how I structure these.
[01:42:21.500 --> 01:42:38.280]  Got it. And then for, for you, Greg, like a year or two from now, kind of revenue in the door for you personally, like, what do you see the breakup in terms of your different focuses?
[01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:41.280]  I mean, you manage grows, you breed, what else?
[01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:48.840]  I mean, really, I've been, I've been focusing on the genetic side of things a lot more specifically this year.
[01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:55.840]  I'm, you know, I'm a consultant more than I am a garden manager at this point.
[01:42:56.840 --> 01:43:04.840]  I don't have, you know, any big contracts at the moment as far as grows that I'm working with to manage their facilities.
[01:43:05.840 --> 01:43:08.840]  You know, for me, genetics has always been the play.
[01:43:09.400 --> 01:43:13.400]  I think, you know, I'm not trying to pretend that I know it all for the growing systems.
[01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:19.400]  And, you know, there's, there's plenty of growers out there that are, you know, way better at what they do than me.
[01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:37.400]  So if I can just get genetics in their hands and make sure that they're happy, you know, growing super good, you know, new genetics that, you know, are going to work in their environment are going to make them their bottom line or, you know, whatever their focus is.
[01:43:37.960 --> 01:43:44.960]  That's kind of my play and whether that's, you know, that's both in the hemp industry and just cannabis industry in general.
[01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:50.960]  You know, high THC and high CBD and, you know, I'm working on a lot of stuff with industrial hemp.
[01:43:51.960 --> 01:43:57.960]  I personally think that cannabis as a plant, industrial hemp is really what's going to change the world.
[01:43:58.960 --> 01:43:59.960]  So, I'm...
[01:44:00.520 --> 01:44:02.520]  So what are you playing with there?
[01:44:03.520 --> 01:44:21.520]  Because I feel like we have such a short body of knowledge in terms, like, for example, in Colorado, you know, what, what, you know, super low THC, high CBD strains like work well versus in Virginia versus in South Carolina versus in San Diego.
[01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:29.080]  And what's your intent on the hemp side in terms of breeding for what and in which microclimates?
[01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:36.080]  So, I mean, this is where I, you know, I'm trying to focus on kind of all those things you said.
[01:44:37.080 --> 01:44:45.080]  Most people that are growing hemp outside of the smokable flower market, you know, and kind of high cannabinoids, smokable flower, it's all grown outside.
[01:44:45.640 --> 01:44:56.640]  So, bioregional microclimate, you know, stuff that does well in a particular, you know, space, you know, and environment is going to be paramount.
[01:44:57.640 --> 01:45:07.640]  Stuff that, you know, grows really well in Southern California outdoors and just hits, checks all the boxes is probably not going to grow the same way.
[01:45:08.200 --> 01:45:17.200]  Or I know it's not going to grow the same way in Tennessee or in New York or a lot of these other hemp markets, you know, in Vermont or Maine or wherever.
[01:45:18.200 --> 01:45:24.200]  So, really focusing on genetics that, you know, kind of tailored to my client.
[01:45:25.200 --> 01:45:35.200]  If someone wants, you know, like in a consulting situation, someone wanted to make a strain that works good in their environment, you know, I'd work on, you know, are they farming for cannabinoids?
[01:45:35.760 --> 01:45:38.760]  Are they farming for fiber, you know, to make clothes or...
[01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:47.760]  Well, that's what I was going to ask. Do you see any movement on the kind of other use cases besides just straight up extraction like fiber?
[01:45:48.760 --> 01:46:01.760]  Well, I mean, I think that, you know, I've kind of had a long view on this one for a long time, but I think when a lot more investment money starts coming into non-cannabinoid hemp, as in fiber hemp, you know,
[01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:13.320]  nutritional hemp for hemp hearts and seed oil and a lot of these things, I think we're going to see a lot of movement with genetics that way.
[01:46:14.320 --> 01:46:18.320]  And I think we'll start to see, you know, people that have 50,000 acres start getting involved.
[01:46:19.320 --> 01:46:30.320]  Not 5 acres, 10 acres, 100 acres of stuff that's, you know, maybe going to go to, you know, a tincture or a salve or, you know, maybe get bagged up and sold at a gas station in Florida or something, you know.
[01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:42.880]  The cannabinoid side of hemp, high CBD or CBG or, you know, whatever the new flavor of the month is for cannabinoid, you know, is going to...
[01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:48.880]  I don't want to say it's a fad, but I don't think it is the true market potential for hemp.
[01:46:49.880 --> 01:46:57.880]  So, obviously, I've focused on high CBD and, you know, high cannabinoid stuff because that's what the market wants right now.
[01:46:58.440 --> 01:47:13.440]  Like, I have a bunch of fiber seed and a bunch of bycrop stuff that I'm working on that you can, you know, not to spill the beans too much, but, you know, stuff that you can grow, harvest for fiber,
[01:47:14.440 --> 01:47:21.440]  leave a portion of the plant that'll then flower and can either be viable for cannabinoid extraction or seed or both.
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:31.000]  So, you can kind of diversify your revenue streams. If everyone could take a lesson from hemp and the CBD tank of 2018 and 19,
[01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:49.000]  you know, a lot of farmers didn't plant this year and most farmers that I know that went hard last year still sitting on their product and they scaled back their operations this year for, you know, CBD or they shifted to smokable flower versus, you know, extraction for, you know, crude oil.
[01:47:49.560 --> 01:48:05.560]  I mean, two years ago, just as an example, you know, a kilogram of CBD oil, you know, just crude oil, you know, was $1,500 and you'd be lucky to get $250 for that same liter today.
[01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:11.560]  You know, distillate went from $4,000 a kilogram to, you know, sitting around $1,000.
[01:48:12.120 --> 01:48:21.120]  You know, isolate used to be, you know, four years ago, isolate was $30,000 for a kilogram. Now, it's like, you can get them out the door for $750.
[01:48:22.120 --> 01:48:35.120]  So, it's like the extraction market is just totally, I mean, CBD in the last year went from $8,000 to $9,000 a kilogram to kind of run a par with distillate now, you know.
[01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:44.680]  It's cheap. It's like, so, you know, farmers got to be able to diversify their income sources when things like this is volatile market, you know.
[01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:56.680]  So, I'm ready with genetics for when people start focusing on the industrial side of him versus the cannabinoid side of him.
[01:48:57.240 --> 01:49:04.240]  I want to be ready because right now, nobody's really doing that. There's a handful of breeders out there, but everyone's kind of riding the train, right?
[01:49:05.240 --> 01:49:13.240]  Follow where the money goes and making the next CBD, CBG, high terpene, whatever strain, you know, which is great. I love it.
[01:49:14.240 --> 01:49:16.240]  I think it's fire looking smokeable addition, bro.
[01:49:17.240 --> 01:49:21.240]  Man, some of this crazy stuff, no doubt that you would definitely confuse for a THC.
[01:49:21.800 --> 01:49:26.800]  Some of the stuff in my garden right now, I can bag it up and show it to you and you would not be able to tell the difference.
[01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:33.800]  But talk about when you smoke that stuff, like how do you, do you like it? Like, do you like rolling joints?
[01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:42.800]  Yeah, it's like a non-alcoholic beer. Sometimes you just don't want to get OG retarded, you know.
[01:49:43.800 --> 01:49:49.800]  And I want that OG flavor, but with just something a little lighter. So, yeah. And I'm working on a few things in that in my realm as well.
[01:49:50.360 --> 01:49:51.360]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:49:52.360 --> 01:50:02.360]  I mean, there is something about, you know, as long as it's, obviously no one wants to smoke like a bunch of hay tasting crackling weed that, you know, doesn't get you high.
[01:50:03.360 --> 01:50:05.360]  You know, at least like it's going to taste like shit. Maybe it'll get you high.
[01:50:06.360 --> 01:50:11.360]  But, you know, CBD and this high cannabinoid hemp, like a lot of smokeable flour out there is embarrassing.
[01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:16.360]  And, you know, there's not a lot of value to it, you know.
[01:50:16.920 --> 01:50:25.920]  So when it comes, you know, super trichome dense and, you know, turped out and just, you know, super high cannabinoid even, you know.
[01:50:26.920 --> 01:50:33.920]  I'm hitting 20, 22% on some of my CBD strains, you know, in CBD and less than 1% THC.
[01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:39.920]  You know, it's like those are still super high quality boutique cannabinoid flours.
[01:50:40.920 --> 01:50:43.920]  It's just not what everyone's used to, you know, the THC that's going to get you super high.
[01:50:44.480 --> 01:50:49.480]  So, yeah, it still tastes great, still has amazing back appeal. It stinks. It still extracts amazing.
[01:50:50.480 --> 01:50:56.480]  You know, only problem with the extraction on my side is there's that point where it goes above the THC limit.
[01:50:57.480 --> 01:50:58.480]  I'm trying to figure that part out.
[01:50:59.480 --> 01:51:00.480]  That's 40% dilute, you know.
[01:51:01.480 --> 01:51:02.480]  That's everyone's problem in the hemp industry.
[01:51:03.480 --> 01:51:13.480]  Well, and I feel like every state has different regulations in terms of like where in the process they'll ding you for passing that threshold, right?
[01:51:14.480 --> 01:51:21.480]  I talked to some people in Virginia where it's only at the farm that they test.
[01:51:22.480 --> 01:51:29.480]  And I assume other states are it's at the extraction facility where they like everything's different. There's no commonality.
[01:51:31.480 --> 01:51:40.480]  Yeah, that's the thing with the Farm Bill, you know, is that it gave the states like kind of the free reign to regulate however they wanted.
[01:51:41.040 --> 01:51:44.040]  Right now, you know, with the new USDA rules, they're trying to hone that in.
[01:51:45.040 --> 01:51:51.040]  But for the most part, at least in Colorado, too, like you're tested at the farm and then you're tested when your product hits the shelf.
[01:51:52.040 --> 01:51:54.040]  But in between there, like there is no license.
[01:51:55.040 --> 01:51:56.040]  Those shelves are not getting tested.
[01:51:57.040 --> 01:52:02.040]  Right. And in Virginia, what I found interesting was like, think about it.
[01:52:03.040 --> 01:52:04.040]  You know, it's a bureaucracy.
[01:52:05.040 --> 01:52:06.040]  I'm getting tested. Sorry.
[01:52:06.600 --> 01:52:07.600]  It's a bureaucracy.
[01:52:08.600 --> 01:52:20.600]  So they only have like, you know, eight guys who go around to farms and like they need to schedule their tours and like they may visit your farm in July and my farm in September.
[01:52:21.600 --> 01:52:26.600]  And I'm fucked because you're when they test you, they're like, you have no THC.
[01:52:27.600 --> 01:52:34.600]  And it's like because you tested them super early and then they come to my farm and like my THC is, you know, above point three percent.
[01:52:35.160 --> 01:52:38.160]  But they tested me in, you know, late September.
[01:52:39.160 --> 01:52:40.160]  Yeah, it's the same way here.
[01:52:41.160 --> 01:52:45.160]  You know, we got tested at our, you know, at our clone facility.
[01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:50.160]  You know what I mean? So these people literally came in and took bags of vegetative material.
[01:52:51.160 --> 01:52:55.160]  You must have been psyched. You're like, I'm going to pass.
[01:52:56.160 --> 01:52:58.160]  It's like a waste of time.
[01:52:58.720 --> 01:53:08.720]  I got to pay for these people that come to the facility and, you know, test something that's, you know, very obviously not doesn't need to be tested.
[01:53:09.720 --> 01:53:15.720]  It's like, you know, so, you know, that's that's kind of the deal with the industry right now and kind of the way that it's playing out.
[01:53:16.720 --> 01:53:27.720]  You know, like this year, there's a lot more people on staff in Colorado, but there was like a team of like four or eight people that were testing every, you know, all thousand farms.
[01:53:28.720 --> 01:53:30.720]  And Colorado, it's just not possible.
[01:53:31.720 --> 01:53:32.720]  So most people didn't get tested for the first three years.
[01:53:33.720 --> 01:53:40.720]  You know what I mean? And, you know, now it's like everybody's getting hit, you know, and they're catching on.
[01:53:41.720 --> 01:53:43.720]  They're starting to be more homogenous with the way that they do things.
[01:53:44.720 --> 01:53:54.720]  And obviously not state to state, but, you know, that'll come, you know, and hopefully, you know, people recognize that, you know, this it's it's all the farmer dependent.
[01:53:55.280 --> 01:53:59.280]  You know, it's like they come at a certain time or, you know, early.
[01:54:00.280 --> 01:54:01.280]  It's like compliant versus not.
[01:54:02.280 --> 01:54:07.280]  And that's, you know, not necessarily a good way to promote, you know, a brand new industry.
[01:54:08.280 --> 01:54:10.280]  But, you know, I don't want to get on my soapbox about that.
[01:54:11.280 --> 01:54:24.280]  So present company excluded, who are some breeders kind of both established and up and coming like that have come across your radar that you respect?
[01:54:25.280 --> 01:54:26.280]  And why?
[01:54:27.280 --> 01:54:29.280]  Well, mostly directed at you.
[01:54:30.280 --> 01:54:31.280]  Yeah. OK.
[01:54:32.280 --> 01:54:38.280]  Well, I would say, I mean, probably one of my favorite breeders of all time is is Fletch from Archives.
[01:54:39.280 --> 01:54:43.280]  Just I want to I kind of have a different criteria of how I judge a breeder.
[01:54:44.280 --> 01:54:45.280]  There's a lot of cool dudes out there.
[01:54:46.280 --> 01:54:49.280]  There's a lot of, you know, not so cool breeders out there.
[01:54:49.840 --> 01:54:53.840]  And, you know, I'll judge people strictly on their genetics.
[01:54:54.840 --> 01:54:58.840]  And, you know, I don't stay out of the drama when it comes from person to person.
[01:54:59.840 --> 01:55:07.840]  You know, so that aside, I mean, I think when it comes to consistency of packs, stuff that I'm like, this is amazing.
[01:55:08.840 --> 01:55:12.840]  Like how I pop ten seeds and all ten of them are keepers.
[01:55:13.840 --> 01:55:15.840]  You know, Archive is one of the best.
[01:55:16.400 --> 01:55:20.400]  And, you know, it depends on time frame, too.
[01:55:21.400 --> 01:55:29.400]  Like rare Dageness seeds at one point, you know, ten years ago was dropping some of my favorite seeds that I've ever grown.
[01:55:30.400 --> 01:55:34.400]  And now, you know, it's not really making seeds as much anymore or whatever.
[01:55:35.400 --> 01:55:42.400]  And actually that that was why I asked my question about your different kind of your vision for your personal like.
[01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:54.960]  You know, percentage of revenue derived from different lines of business, because when I were supposed to have Scott reach on and when I talked to him before and will eventually have that episode.
[01:55:55.960 --> 01:56:02.960]  But when I talked to him, he was like, well, I don't like my breeding and genetics.
[01:56:03.960 --> 01:56:06.960]  Revenue is such a small portion of my business right now.
[01:56:07.960 --> 01:56:09.960]  And I was like, that's what I want to talk about.
[01:56:10.520 --> 01:56:14.520]  Because you've you started with one thing and that's what you were known for.
[01:56:15.520 --> 01:56:18.520]  But you're now doing eight other things and now they're all growing.
[01:56:19.520 --> 01:56:27.520]  And it's like, how do you how do you allocate capital to, you know, I only have so much capital and I want to chase this and I want to chase that.
[01:56:28.520 --> 01:56:30.520]  And like, I'm going to put it over here to grow that.
[01:56:31.520 --> 01:56:37.520]  And so to your point, like that's not the bulk of his business now.
[01:56:38.080 --> 01:56:43.080]  Oh, you know, and that's, you know, people change, you know, for whatever reason.
[01:56:44.080 --> 01:56:48.080]  You know, there's lots of things that can happen in your life and detour you from whatever your original goal was.
[01:56:49.080 --> 01:56:51.080]  You know, like me, genetics have always been the play.
[01:56:52.080 --> 01:56:53.080]  I think they will continue to be the play.
[01:56:54.080 --> 01:57:01.080]  You know, no matter who you are, you know, farmer at what scale, you're you're going to try to grow the fire when it comes to cannabis.
[01:57:02.080 --> 01:57:07.080]  You want that genetic that is just, you know, the thing that you want to smoke or the thing that is going to sell the best or whatever.
[01:57:08.080 --> 01:57:09.080]  You know, that's kind of going to continue to be my focus.
[01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:15.080]  Now, I don't, you know, I don't go to trade shows and, you know, walk away with mountains of cash.
[01:57:16.080 --> 01:57:18.080]  I'm not like that scale of a breeder.
[01:57:19.080 --> 01:57:20.080]  Not that I'm not making the seeds that I could do that.
[01:57:21.080 --> 01:57:29.080]  But, you know, I'm not a I don't market myself in such a way or go to a lot of those expos in the way that a lot of these guys do.
[01:57:30.080 --> 01:57:33.080]  You're not a capulator with lines around the corner.
[01:57:33.640 --> 01:57:34.640]  Not now.
[01:57:34.640 --> 01:57:44.640]  I will say that people that grab my seeds and pop them are extremely happy with, you know, all of their all the females they get and, you know, are happy with the quality overall.
[01:57:45.640 --> 01:57:51.640]  You know, but yeah, I mean, it's just because there isn't a line of 500 people that know who I am.
[01:57:52.640 --> 01:58:02.640]  That's why they're not waiting in line around the block, you know, and I didn't market a particular cut of my genetics in a way that.
[01:58:03.640 --> 01:58:13.640]  Everyone knew of my cut before they ever knew about my seeds, you know, so that's another way, another angle, you know, potentially, you know, but.
[01:58:14.640 --> 01:58:16.640]  You know, for me, genetics is a play.
[01:58:17.640 --> 01:58:19.640]  I'm, you know, the bulk of my capital is from consulting gigs.
[01:58:20.640 --> 01:58:30.640]  And eventually I would just I would like to just open breeding facilities and, you know, in from state to state in different legal markets.
[01:58:31.200 --> 01:58:38.200]  And, you know, provide I would love to be a nursery, you know, because it's, you know, it's a very gray area.
[01:58:39.200 --> 01:58:42.200]  Where would you want to what state would you want to open your first nursery in?
[01:58:43.200 --> 01:58:44.200]  I mean.
[01:58:47.200 --> 01:58:50.200]  That's a tough one, actually, because there's I mean, maybe.
[01:58:53.200 --> 01:58:54.200]  Maybe New York.
[01:58:55.200 --> 01:58:56.200]  Wow.
[01:58:56.200 --> 01:58:57.200]  I don't but I don't necessarily.
[01:58:58.200 --> 01:58:59.200]  I'm thinking markets.
[01:58:59.760 --> 01:59:03.760]  You know, I'm just thinking market, you know, up and coming markets, you know, that aren't already flooded.
[01:59:04.760 --> 01:59:08.760]  You know, obviously I could probably sell the most cuts if I went to California, but there's a ton of nurseries there that are doing great.
[01:59:09.760 --> 01:59:11.760]  You know, I could do the thing here in Colorado.
[01:59:12.760 --> 01:59:17.760]  There isn't that many nurseries, actually, of people that are just so, you know, Oklahoma.
[01:59:18.760 --> 01:59:19.760]  Oklahoma's really.
[01:59:20.760 --> 01:59:21.760]  Oklahoma's the Wild West.
[01:59:22.320 --> 01:59:23.320]  It is.
[01:59:23.320 --> 01:59:31.320]  And there's a lot of a lot of people just they have their big corporate cannabis and they don't want to take the time.
[01:59:32.320 --> 01:59:44.320]  You know, they would rather put the capital towards buying, you know, their cuts from a nursery versus popping their own seeds or, you know, dedicating square footage that isn't for flowering to something else like taking clones.
[01:59:45.320 --> 01:59:49.320]  You know, I mean, there's I think Oklahoma makes a lot of sense.
[01:59:50.320 --> 01:59:51.320]  I mean, I got family there.
[01:59:51.880 --> 01:59:53.880]  I've got land and stuff there, too.
[01:59:54.880 --> 01:59:57.880]  So it's you know, that would probably be one of the first steps.
[01:59:58.880 --> 01:59:59.880]  You know, the connections there run deep.
[02:00:00.880 --> 02:00:01.880]  So that would be a good spot.
[02:00:02.880 --> 02:00:06.880]  You know, I would love to, you know, start offering genetics.
[02:00:07.880 --> 02:00:09.880]  I mean, I just I would I love Colorado.
[02:00:10.880 --> 02:00:20.880]  I would like to just do this where I live and be able to legally provide genetics across the country without the kind of.
[02:00:21.880 --> 02:00:27.880]  You know, the play on the gray area situation would be would be the most ideal for me.
[02:00:28.880 --> 02:00:33.880]  But I do think, you know, just fledgling markets where people are, you know, just getting started.
[02:00:34.880 --> 02:00:40.880]  I think it's going to be right for the picking when it comes to starting nurseries and providing genetics that, you know, people need.
[02:00:41.880 --> 02:00:44.880]  You know, they need to put this new new on their shelf so that it can sell.
[02:00:45.880 --> 02:00:46.880]  And yeah.
[02:00:47.440 --> 02:00:50.440]  So, you know, that's that's kind of the goal.
[02:00:51.440 --> 02:01:00.440]  In terms of your breeding, like are you have your personal library and that's stuff you've read, stuff you've brought in from other people like.
[02:01:01.440 --> 02:01:03.440]  I have a fridge full. It's disgusting.
[02:01:04.440 --> 02:01:05.440]  Like I'm kind of a seed hoarder. Like it's gnarly.
[02:01:06.440 --> 02:01:10.440]  But but so are you still bringing in lots of new stuff?
[02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:20.000]  Are you like, let me just play with what I have for a while to kind of bring things that I already have in my own personal library in certain directions?
[02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:24.000]  Like I mean, who are you from the outside?
[02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000]  Who are you bringing stuff in from the kind of.
[02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:33.000]  Karma Genetics is probably maybe maybe my favorite breeder of all time.
[02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:40.000]  This guy is right on line with, you know, the sours and the gas that, you know, like in seed form with his sours.
[02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:45.000]  And, you know, pretty much everything he makes is just it checks all my boxes.
[02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:49.000]  So Karma Genetics is my favorite breeder for sure.
[02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:59.000]  I mean, I love a lot of stuff that, you know, exotic genetics is bringing out as far as what I see in concentrate form.
[02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000]  But I will admittedly I don't grow a lot of that stuff.
[02:02:02.560 --> 02:02:03.560]  I really like it.
[02:02:04.560 --> 02:02:11.560]  But for whatever reason, I just I don't spend a lot of capital on on brand new genetics right now.
[02:02:12.560 --> 02:02:13.560]  I have in the past.
[02:02:13.560 --> 02:02:15.560]  I have a ton of stuff in my vault.
[02:02:16.560 --> 02:02:18.560]  I've got a lot of Dungeons Vault genetic stuff.
[02:02:19.560 --> 02:02:21.560]  I have, you know, quite a bit of karma.
[02:02:22.560 --> 02:02:25.560]  There's some local breeders here that I don't even know if they're doing anything anymore.
[02:02:26.560 --> 02:02:27.560]  But nerds genetics.
[02:02:28.560 --> 02:02:29.560]  I don't know.
[02:02:30.120 --> 02:02:34.120]  I mean, I've got a lot of his gear that I've been impressed with so far.
[02:02:35.120 --> 02:02:43.120]  You know, I tend to lately, like in the last two years, I've been really diving deep on my own stuff.
[02:02:44.120 --> 02:02:53.120]  It's easy to pop someone's seeds and find a winner and then just cross that out with something else that I found in seed form.
[02:02:53.120 --> 02:02:54.120]  That's a winner.
[02:02:54.120 --> 02:02:58.120]  And I, you know, obviously I got my start doing that.
[02:02:58.680 --> 02:03:03.680]  And I still do it because I think it's fun recombining stuff that I love.
[02:03:04.680 --> 02:03:23.680]  But really, I've been focusing more on my own novel genetics and really taken the stuff that I've read and, you know, out crossing, in crossing, in breeding, back crossing, you know, doing a lot of the work to get my gear where I really want it to be.
[02:03:24.240 --> 02:03:35.240]  So I admittedly haven't been, you know, I haven't been buying a lot of seeds and I haven't been popping a lot of other people's gear other than literally like Karma's.
[02:03:36.240 --> 02:03:39.240]  Like every time I do a seed round, you know, I pop something of his.
[02:03:40.240 --> 02:03:45.240]  And, you know, good buddy, 303 Skywalker.
[02:03:46.240 --> 02:03:51.240]  I don't even know what his seed company is, but he's given me lots of seeds over the years.
[02:03:51.800 --> 02:03:54.800]  And, you know, there's a lot of fun stuff to play with in there too.
[02:03:55.800 --> 02:03:59.800]  So, you know, I'm trying to throw an outside breeder in when I do a seed pop.
[02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:02.800]  But really, I have so much gear that I've made.
[02:04:03.800 --> 02:04:08.800]  I'm talking like hundreds of strains that I'm really just, you know, I don't trust a lot of people with testing my gear.
[02:04:09.800 --> 02:04:12.800]  A lot of times I've given out a lot of seeds to folks.
[02:04:13.800 --> 02:04:17.800]  I mean, just retarded amounts of seeds to people that are so-called testers.
[02:04:18.800 --> 02:04:20.800]  And I never received any feedback whatsoever.
[02:04:21.800 --> 02:04:27.800]  So I've just found that, you know, if I'm going to see what my gear has to offer, I'm going to grow it myself.
[02:04:28.800 --> 02:04:33.800]  I'm going to grow it in a system that I know I'm breeding it in so that I can really see what it can do.
[02:04:34.800 --> 02:04:38.800]  So I've been dedicating a lot of my energy and time into popping my own seeds,
[02:04:39.800 --> 02:04:44.800]  furthering lines that I really like and I think have potential for whatever reason.
[02:04:45.800 --> 02:04:48.800]  And just kind of go in that route as a reason.
[02:04:51.800 --> 02:04:55.800]  One of the things that separates Greg and Genome Alchemy from a lot of breeders,
[02:04:56.800 --> 02:05:02.800]  these hype breeders that come on the scene and fall off real quick is Greg's backcrossing and actually breeding.
[02:05:03.800 --> 02:05:07.800]  It's a lot of work, man. It takes years to get a gene.
[02:05:08.800 --> 02:05:11.800]  I've been working on this Panama Red strain.
[02:05:12.800 --> 02:05:14.800]  I got Panama Red across to a Jedi Cush back in 2012.
[02:05:15.800 --> 02:05:16.800]  And I'm still working on the strain.
[02:05:17.800 --> 02:05:20.800]  I release it here and there when I find some generations that are amazing.
[02:05:21.800 --> 02:05:24.800]  It's still a work in progress eight years later.
[02:05:25.800 --> 02:05:31.800]  So it's like when someone says, I'm going to do a new drop of Gen-X, I just made these seeds.
[02:05:32.800 --> 02:05:36.800]  And then they're available on the market for someone to buy four months later, six months later.
[02:05:37.800 --> 02:05:40.800]  In my opinion, it's super rushed.
[02:05:41.800 --> 02:05:48.800]  And I think that it probably hasn't been developed as far as it could be.
[02:05:49.360 --> 02:05:50.360]  So that's obviously my opinion.
[02:05:51.360 --> 02:05:52.360]  A lot of people work with a lot of people.
[02:05:53.360 --> 02:05:56.360]  And the more gardens that you work in, you can get your genetics popped.
[02:05:57.360 --> 02:06:01.360]  And you can see generations on generations and really do some proper selection.
[02:06:02.360 --> 02:06:05.360]  But I do it all myself.
[02:06:06.360 --> 02:06:07.360]  So it takes a long time.
[02:06:08.360 --> 02:06:11.820]  But I appreciate that.
[02:06:12.820 --> 02:06:15.820]  When I was first starting out, there was Ben Holmes.
[02:06:16.820 --> 02:06:17.820]  Are you familiar with that dude here in Colorado?
[02:06:18.380 --> 02:06:21.380]  He did a lot of the Centennial seeds.
[02:06:22.380 --> 02:06:27.380]  A lot of my hemp lines are from his genetics.
[02:06:28.380 --> 02:06:29.380]  We used to sell his seeds.
[02:06:30.380 --> 02:06:33.380]  Centennial seeds, I never see that dude's gear anymore.
[02:06:34.380 --> 02:06:37.380]  He had so many herding problems.
[02:06:38.380 --> 02:06:40.380]  A lot of his stuff.
[02:06:40.940 --> 02:06:46.940]  We were selling all those seeds at Highland Health.
[02:06:47.940 --> 02:06:48.940]  I was there.
[02:06:49.940 --> 02:06:50.940]  Absolutely.
[02:06:51.940 --> 02:06:54.940]  There were a bunch of herding issues with those seeds.
[02:06:55.940 --> 02:06:57.940]  But Ben's still around, for sure.
[02:06:58.940 --> 02:07:03.940]  A lot of his CBD stuff has been foundational for pushing high-CBD cannabis.
[02:07:04.940 --> 02:07:05.940]  Yeah, he's been crushing.
[02:07:06.940 --> 02:07:08.940]  Everyone knows about Auto, too.
[02:07:09.500 --> 02:07:10.500]  That was Centennial.
[02:07:11.500 --> 02:07:14.500]  Every hemp grower has grown that stream.
[02:07:15.500 --> 02:07:16.500]  Or has at least heard of it.
[02:07:17.500 --> 02:07:18.500]  I respect that dude.
[02:07:19.500 --> 02:07:21.500]  There was a bushy old guy, Bog Seeds.
[02:07:22.500 --> 02:07:23.500]  Yeah, a bushy old grower.
[02:07:24.500 --> 02:07:26.500]  Blue Moon Rocks was something that I was hyped.
[02:07:27.500 --> 02:07:30.500]  We nicknamed it the mortgage bearer because I felt like it was true.
[02:07:31.500 --> 02:07:35.500]  When we started cultivating with the living soil, I felt like the full expression started to come out.
[02:07:36.060 --> 02:07:39.060]  That was when I felt like I started to understand more what was going on.
[02:07:40.060 --> 02:07:43.060]  I used to grow LSD from Kimbo Kush.
[02:07:44.060 --> 02:07:45.060]  That's a long time ago.
[02:07:46.060 --> 02:07:47.060]  I think it was the Kimbo Kush cross.
[02:07:48.060 --> 02:07:51.060]  Everyone's a breeder these days.
[02:07:52.060 --> 02:07:55.060]  I tend to gravitate towards the people that are still doing it.
[02:07:56.060 --> 02:07:57.060]  Not the one-offs.
[02:07:58.060 --> 02:07:59.060]  Yeah.
[02:08:00.060 --> 02:08:03.060]  I personally got to give a shout out to Duke Diamond.
[02:08:03.620 --> 02:08:06.620]  I feel like that gentleman has always been really nice to me.
[02:08:07.620 --> 02:08:10.620]  I feel like he's always gone out of his way to show respect.
[02:08:11.620 --> 02:08:16.620]  A lot of those breeders at that level, let's be honest, behind the scenes, just aren't that way.
[02:08:17.620 --> 02:08:22.620]  I feel like if someone's showing that much respect to everyone, it seems like,
[02:08:23.620 --> 02:08:27.620]  I want to run through their gear just because I feel like that person...
[02:08:28.620 --> 02:08:30.620]  I really don't know how to describe this.
[02:08:31.180 --> 02:08:33.180]  I feel like when someone carries themselves the way they have,
[02:08:34.180 --> 02:08:35.180]  the history that they have on themselves,
[02:08:36.180 --> 02:08:40.180]  and the gear that they're trying to pump out, usually for about $100.
[02:08:41.180 --> 02:08:43.180]  In my opinion, I feel like that is really worth it.
[02:08:44.180 --> 02:08:46.180]  There's another Duke Derrick here with Sunleaf Seeds.
[02:08:47.180 --> 02:08:49.180]  I run his Sour Pink Al.
[02:08:50.180 --> 02:08:52.180]  That was one that really stuck out for me that I felt like...
[02:08:53.180 --> 02:08:54.180]  I think he also had this...
[02:08:55.180 --> 02:08:56.180]  It was like a gang.
[02:08:57.180 --> 02:08:58.180]  There's a gangster one, Al Capone.
[02:08:58.740 --> 02:09:01.740]  He had an Al Capone that we ran that was really fantastic.
[02:09:02.740 --> 02:09:05.740]  The Mac and Cheese from Capulator, that was the one that we had run
[02:09:06.740 --> 02:09:09.740]  that I felt like lived up to the hype of the bag appeal.
[02:09:10.740 --> 02:09:14.740]  But as far as Terps and stuff, I feel like Duke Diamond stuff is more...
[02:09:15.740 --> 02:09:16.740]  I don't know if you've ever watched his stuff.
[02:09:17.740 --> 02:09:18.740]  No. What is...
[02:09:19.740 --> 02:09:20.740]  He's more of the skunk.
[02:09:21.740 --> 02:09:22.740]  Dominion Seeds.
[02:09:23.740 --> 02:09:24.740]  Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:09:25.740 --> 02:09:26.740]  What did I just...
[02:09:27.300 --> 02:09:28.300]  It's like Kim family stuff.
[02:09:29.300 --> 02:09:30.300]  No, somebody just...
[02:09:31.300 --> 02:09:32.300]  We were talking about something strange and they were like,
[02:09:32.300 --> 02:09:33.300]  that's Dominion.
[02:09:34.300 --> 02:09:38.300]  And by the way, Brian, do you have any idea what the status with Duke is right now?
[02:09:39.300 --> 02:09:43.300]  You know, I've reached out to a few people and it just seems like
[02:09:44.300 --> 02:09:46.300]  the cans just kicked down the road another few months
[02:09:47.300 --> 02:09:48.300]  and everyone's hoping that something's going to happen
[02:09:49.300 --> 02:09:50.300]  and then the cans kick down the road a few more months.
[02:09:51.300 --> 02:09:52.300]  He's caught up.
[02:09:53.300 --> 02:09:54.300]  Damn.
[02:09:54.860 --> 02:09:55.860]  I would love to actually...
[02:09:56.860 --> 02:09:57.860]  With that, Peter, I would love to talk to you off air with that, man.
[02:09:58.860 --> 02:10:00.860]  Because there's, you know, we kind of hit it at some of that stuff before.
[02:10:01.860 --> 02:10:02.860]  So if that's something that we could do for him,
[02:10:03.860 --> 02:10:04.860]  I know I would love to be a part of it.
[02:10:05.860 --> 02:10:06.860]  Yeah.
[02:10:07.860 --> 02:10:09.860]  Yo, and much respect and love to the brethren Lemon Hoco in the chat.
[02:10:10.860 --> 02:10:11.860]  All this cool family over there.
[02:10:14.860 --> 02:10:16.860]  And by the way, what's the glass of choice tonight?
[02:10:19.860 --> 02:10:20.860]  This is for Melo Vora, actually.
[02:10:21.860 --> 02:10:23.860]  This is from our boy over there on the other side of this.
[02:10:24.860 --> 02:10:25.860]  This is to Gary Forger.
[02:10:26.860 --> 02:10:29.860]  This is his dad bar and this is kind of like his world.
[02:10:30.860 --> 02:10:31.860]  So I want to give a quick shout out to him for that
[02:10:32.860 --> 02:10:35.860]  because we wouldn't be able to do it as classy as we are tonight without him.
[02:10:38.860 --> 02:10:39.860]  And we're classy tonight.
[02:10:40.860 --> 02:10:41.860]  We are.
[02:10:42.860 --> 02:10:44.860]  That's the one word that kept popping into my head is classy.
[02:10:45.860 --> 02:10:47.860]  Yeah, we went out in quality conversations.
[02:10:48.860 --> 02:10:52.860]  That was really the end goal, I feel like, is to not interrupt,
[02:10:53.420 --> 02:10:57.420]  but I feel like that's the main thing is guys like Greg need that platform.
[02:10:58.420 --> 02:11:00.420]  You know, Nick doesn't really need that platform.
[02:11:01.420 --> 02:11:03.420]  He's been able to do that for himself, obviously.
[02:11:04.420 --> 02:11:05.420]  I kicked him, you know.
[02:11:06.420 --> 02:11:08.420]  But yeah, no, this man has been humble.
[02:11:09.420 --> 02:11:10.420]  He's been around for a long time.
[02:11:11.420 --> 02:11:12.420]  He definitely deserves the light, the shine, for sure.
[02:11:13.420 --> 02:11:14.420]  That's why I made that flyer even though, G,
[02:11:15.420 --> 02:11:17.420]  because I wanted people to know that it's not like, you know,
[02:11:18.420 --> 02:11:19.420]  some of us have been around for a while.
[02:11:20.420 --> 02:11:21.420]  Some of us want to help.
[02:11:21.980 --> 02:11:24.980]  We were selling weed together before all this regulatory shit.
[02:11:25.980 --> 02:11:26.980]  Oh man, I had to pay for my college, man.
[02:11:27.980 --> 02:11:31.980]  Well, Brian stepped up his Photoshop skills just for you.
[02:11:32.980 --> 02:11:33.980]  Yeah, I was, yeah.
[02:11:34.980 --> 02:11:35.980]  Well, you know.
[02:11:36.980 --> 02:11:41.980]  From the first flyer with Josh to this one, it's, it's, uh.
[02:11:42.980 --> 02:11:43.980]  It's cleaner.
[02:11:44.980 --> 02:11:45.980]  It's sleeker.
[02:11:46.980 --> 02:11:47.980]  It's a tight fit.
[02:11:48.540 --> 02:11:52.540]  We're gonna see your journey as a graphic designer as well.
[02:11:53.540 --> 02:11:54.540]  Yeah, that is not my forte.
[02:11:55.540 --> 02:11:57.540]  Me neither, but I got to do it every fucking week.
[02:11:58.540 --> 02:11:59.540]  That's why I loved when you did it.
[02:12:00.540 --> 02:12:01.540]  I was like that first one.
[02:12:02.540 --> 02:12:03.540]  I was like, this is tough, but it's good enough.
[02:12:04.540 --> 02:12:05.540]  It works for me.
[02:12:06.540 --> 02:12:07.540]  Well, I'm just, I'm honored.
[02:12:08.540 --> 02:12:11.540]  You know, like I said, I've been doing, these guys put me on.
[02:12:12.540 --> 02:12:13.540]  I really appreciate it.
[02:12:14.540 --> 02:12:15.540]  I've been doing this a long time.
[02:12:16.100 --> 02:12:17.100]  Nothing's going to change, you know, as far as that goes.
[02:12:18.100 --> 02:12:20.100]  It'd just be, uh, it'd be nice to get, you know, my seeds into some more
[02:12:21.100 --> 02:12:25.100]  people's hands and, um, you know, really start to see, um, you know,
[02:12:26.100 --> 02:12:29.100]  see some expansion, you know, see some people grow on some stuff that
[02:12:30.100 --> 02:12:35.100]  isn't, you know, uh, a cake or a, um, a runt or a, you know, something
[02:12:36.100 --> 02:12:41.100]  like that and really just, uh, you know, um, expanding the, the
[02:12:41.660 --> 02:12:44.660]  diversity of flower on shelves across the country, you know, and
[02:12:45.660 --> 02:12:48.660]  obviously everyone's got their bottom line to worry about, but,
[02:12:49.660 --> 02:12:53.660]  you know, it's, uh, um, it's just fun ultimately for me to breed.
[02:12:54.660 --> 02:12:57.660]  And it's what my passion is in this industry.
[02:12:58.660 --> 02:13:01.660]  You know, there's growers, there's extractors and, you know, me, I'm a,
[02:13:02.660 --> 02:13:05.660]  I'm a farmer breeder and that's like, kind of what I'm going to
[02:13:06.660 --> 02:13:07.660]  continue to do.
[02:13:08.220 --> 02:13:11.220]  You know, kind of behind the scenes or front of the house or whatever,
[02:13:12.220 --> 02:13:13.220]  you know?
[02:13:13.220 --> 02:13:15.220]  So, um, I'm just, I'm honored to be on this.
[02:13:16.220 --> 02:13:19.220]  I mean, I've been watching this show, you know, for a while and it's,
[02:13:20.220 --> 02:13:23.220]  it's, uh, you know, I'm honored to be on it.
[02:13:24.220 --> 02:13:27.220]  So I appreciate, um, appreciate the chance.
[02:13:28.220 --> 02:13:29.220]  Yeah.
[02:13:29.220 --> 02:13:32.220]  Well, no, I love, I mean, Brian, if your reason for bringing him on
[02:13:33.220 --> 02:13:36.220]  was to kind of get him on the show, I mean, I think you're right.
[02:13:36.780 --> 02:13:39.780]  My reason for bringing him on was to kind of shine a light on someone
[02:13:40.780 --> 02:13:41.780]  who deserves attention.
[02:13:41.780 --> 02:13:42.780]  That's kind of what I live to do.
[02:13:43.780 --> 02:13:44.780]  So that's exactly what I feel.
[02:13:45.780 --> 02:13:49.780]  And it seems like Nick and Brian think that you deserve a little more
[02:13:50.780 --> 02:13:51.780]  attention than you currently get.
[02:13:52.780 --> 02:13:53.780]  100.
[02:13:53.780 --> 02:13:54.780]  I keep tagging him in everyone's posts.
[02:13:55.780 --> 02:13:57.780]  People are like, yo, who's the next up and coming breed?
[02:13:58.780 --> 02:13:59.780]  I'm like tagging him.
[02:13:59.780 --> 02:14:02.780]  Every time I'm like trying to spread his genetics everywhere I can go.
[02:14:03.780 --> 02:14:04.780]  Like I traveled the world.
[02:14:05.340 --> 02:14:07.340]  I put some genome alchemy in my pocket before I touched road.
[02:14:08.340 --> 02:14:11.340]  I mean, I do what I can, but he definitely deserves more than what I can
[02:14:12.340 --> 02:14:13.340]  push out there for him.
[02:14:14.340 --> 02:14:17.340]  The cup that you won, man, was the judges on that.
[02:14:18.340 --> 02:14:19.340]  I felt like we're legit people.
[02:14:20.340 --> 02:14:21.340]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:14:21.340 --> 02:14:23.340]  And that was, that was great too, to be able to win, you know,
[02:14:24.340 --> 02:14:27.340]  a cup of a genetic that I produced, you know, because I've been,
[02:14:28.340 --> 02:14:31.340]  you know, we won Canada's cups with, with pink house, you know,
[02:14:31.900 --> 02:14:34.900]  like with our, our grow teams there and grow teams that I've been on.
[02:14:35.900 --> 02:14:36.900]  SFV, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:14:37.900 --> 02:14:40.900]  You know, we've, we've won high times cups and, you know,
[02:14:41.900 --> 02:14:42.900]  that sort of thing.
[02:14:43.900 --> 02:14:45.900]  But this was, you know, this was all me, you know, in a sense of like
[02:14:46.900 --> 02:14:48.900]  single source, you know, I bred the strain, I grew it.
[02:14:49.900 --> 02:14:52.900]  I did everything that came to put it in front of the judges, you know,
[02:14:53.900 --> 02:14:56.900]  and that was, that was a bit unique, you know, and the fact that it was
[02:14:57.900 --> 02:15:00.900]  in front of some pretty hardcore judges, you know, I mean,
[02:15:01.900 --> 02:15:04.900]  some people that are very real about their expectations of flour and not
[02:15:05.900 --> 02:15:08.900]  gonna, you know, kind of pick the lesser of evils, but literally just
[02:15:09.900 --> 02:15:10.900]  extremely harsh.
[02:15:11.900 --> 02:15:14.900]  Like I was like, comparing notes and some of them were given zeros.
[02:15:15.900 --> 02:15:18.900]  Damn, you know, and that's, and you're shy, man.
[02:15:19.900 --> 02:15:23.900]  I would say that for, for the loud kind of stuff where you crack it open,
[02:15:24.900 --> 02:15:26.900]  I remember whatever your number was on that.
[02:15:27.900 --> 02:15:30.900]  I felt like the judges were kind of straight and gossiping about it.
[02:15:31.900 --> 02:15:35.900]  So that's what you can expect, you know, with at least with a lot of
[02:15:36.900 --> 02:15:39.900]  my genetics, you know, that's, that just happened to be the one that
[02:15:40.900 --> 02:15:43.900]  I had ready for the cup at that time, you know, it was timing was right.
[02:15:44.900 --> 02:15:47.900]  And, you know, that was, that was a good one.
[02:15:48.900 --> 02:15:50.900]  You were the clear winner, man.
[02:15:51.900 --> 02:15:52.900]  I feel like that was, that was fun.
[02:15:53.900 --> 02:15:55.900]  Well, at least the first year, you know, a bunch of other way better.
[02:15:56.900 --> 02:15:58.900]  I was going to say AJ.
[02:15:59.460 --> 02:16:00.460]  Yeah.
[02:16:00.460 --> 02:16:02.460]  So again, AJ won the second year with that.
[02:16:03.460 --> 02:16:05.460]  And that guy is also well designed.
[02:16:06.460 --> 02:16:07.460]  Absolutely.
[02:16:07.460 --> 02:16:08.460]  Growing organic on Instagram.
[02:16:09.460 --> 02:16:13.460]  Couldn't have happened to again, another great guy such as yourself.
[02:16:14.460 --> 02:16:15.460]  He's always helped.
[02:16:16.460 --> 02:16:18.460]  I feel like, you know, if I call Bill of Soil and stuff,
[02:16:19.460 --> 02:16:20.460]  Bill of Soil, I mean, I got a shout out.
[02:16:21.460 --> 02:16:22.460]  He's going to actually answer the phone.
[02:16:23.460 --> 02:16:24.460]  Oh yeah, Jeremy's awesome.
[02:16:25.460 --> 02:16:28.460]  Jeremy Silva, all of, Jeremy Silva with his website was one of the first
[02:16:29.460 --> 02:16:31.460]  people I was starting to kind of comprehend all the other things that I was learning.
[02:16:32.460 --> 02:16:34.460]  And from Dr. Lang-An-Am and Jeff Longfells.
[02:16:35.460 --> 02:16:40.460]  And then I started to see where he was going with that, with the clackamas coots kind of recipes.
[02:16:41.460 --> 02:16:45.460]  And yeah, you get those concepts and then you kind of become the chef and then you kind of work,
[02:16:46.460 --> 02:16:47.460]  you know, you work your way through it.
[02:16:48.460 --> 02:16:51.460]  And I started and still live by the 30, 30, 30, you know, coots mix, man.
[02:16:52.460 --> 02:16:56.460]  Like that's been a staple in my garden when I mix my own soil.
[02:16:57.020 --> 02:16:58.020]  Because I mix my own soil, you know what I mean?
[02:16:59.020 --> 02:17:03.020]  For in my garden, you know, I don't really buy pre-mixed, you know,
[02:17:04.020 --> 02:17:08.020]  and Clackamas Coots was the dude that got me on to Living Soil, you know.
[02:17:09.020 --> 02:17:14.020]  Actually, Scott Reach was the one that got me into my first super soil mix way back in the day on the forums.
[02:17:15.020 --> 02:17:16.020]  Moonshot Mix.
[02:17:17.020 --> 02:17:18.020]  Moonshot Mix.
[02:17:19.020 --> 02:17:21.020]  Like it's not even Living Soil, it's the super soil.
[02:17:21.580 --> 02:17:27.580]  I mean, it's literally every kind of bagged soil and everything that you can get from the grocery store all mixed in one.
[02:17:28.580 --> 02:17:33.580]  But the goal is the same, you know, to like not pump a bunch of synthetic nutrients from a bottle
[02:17:34.580 --> 02:17:37.580]  and to be able to have something that you can recycle for a long time, you know.
[02:17:38.580 --> 02:17:40.580]  So that was what got me started.
[02:17:41.580 --> 02:17:44.580]  And then, you know, obviously stepping into the microbiology side of things, you know,
[02:17:45.580 --> 02:17:47.580]  really realizing that super soils have their uses.
[02:17:48.140 --> 02:17:51.140]  But, you know, for the most part, they're hot, man.
[02:17:52.140 --> 02:17:59.140]  Like they're just, there's so much nutrient packed into a super soil that the plants are, they struggle with it right off the bat.
[02:18:00.140 --> 02:18:03.140]  You know what I mean? You got to like, you got to ease them into that sort of system.
[02:18:04.140 --> 02:18:08.140]  And then sometimes they'll run out of food before they're, you know, it's like,
[02:18:09.140 --> 02:18:10.140]  One packet is a total error.
[02:18:11.140 --> 02:18:15.140]  Human error is big with that, especially with the Suncool's super soil.
[02:18:15.700 --> 02:18:16.700]  Yeah, similar, similar kind of move.
[02:18:17.700 --> 02:18:20.700]  Put it in the, where those little kiddie pools back in the day.
[02:18:23.700 --> 02:18:27.700]  With your raised beds, like how many cycles have you gone through kind of,
[02:18:29.700 --> 02:18:33.700]  I mean, obviously you're adding a little bit more each time, but like,
[02:18:34.700 --> 02:18:37.700]  without having to dump it all out and start over again.
[02:18:38.700 --> 02:18:43.700]  I mean, I've got some hugel beds that are, some hugelkultur beds that are,
[02:18:44.260 --> 02:18:47.260]  you know, three or four years old and I haven't had to do anything to,
[02:18:48.260 --> 02:18:50.260]  except for, you know, a little bit of compost.
[02:18:51.260 --> 02:18:52.260]  And those are obviously no-till beds.
[02:18:53.260 --> 02:18:58.260]  So it's just as long as I can keep my cover crop rocking throughout the year and the mulch heavy,
[02:18:59.260 --> 02:19:01.260]  like the thing just kicks constantly.
[02:19:02.260 --> 02:19:08.260]  As far as the, you know, the raised beds in my greenhouse, like I'm probably four years on those too.
[02:19:08.820 --> 02:19:14.820]  But like without, you know, same thing with my 30 gallon indoor pots.
[02:19:15.820 --> 02:19:18.820]  Like I haven't, aside from pulling or like, you know,
[02:19:19.820 --> 02:19:22.820]  digging a hole to put the new plant into it, you know,
[02:19:23.820 --> 02:19:24.820]  that's really the only tilling it gets.
[02:19:25.820 --> 02:19:30.820]  And, you know, those are, I've been growing in these same pots for five years now.
[02:19:31.820 --> 02:19:35.820]  You know, so I'm like, I don't know, 15 cycles or something in the soil.
[02:19:36.380 --> 02:19:38.380]  And it's just getting better.
[02:19:39.380 --> 02:19:40.380]  And that's in a 30 gallon pot?
[02:19:41.380 --> 02:19:42.380]  That's in a 30 gallon smart pot.
[02:19:43.380 --> 02:19:44.380]  Wow. Okay.
[02:19:45.380 --> 02:19:47.380]  I would say that's almost the minimum, right? 25, 30?
[02:19:48.380 --> 02:19:49.380]  I agree. You know what I mean?
[02:19:50.380 --> 02:19:51.380]  I'm just an upper level.
[02:19:52.380 --> 02:19:55.380]  If you're growing plants at size, when you start to get, you know, like a 15 gallon pot,
[02:19:56.380 --> 02:20:00.380]  like you really will outgrow that pot and you will deplete the nutrition quickly.
[02:20:01.380 --> 02:20:04.380]  So, you know, normal size indoor plants, 30 gallon, you know.
[02:20:04.940 --> 02:20:07.940]  I know, like, I think Mountain Organics, he could do that, like 10 gallon.
[02:20:08.940 --> 02:20:10.940]  That dude, he grows a hundred gallon.
[02:20:11.940 --> 02:20:12.940]  Dude, 30 gallon just to keep it.
[02:20:13.940 --> 02:20:15.940]  You know, we'll put six plants in a 200 gallon pot.
[02:20:16.940 --> 02:20:17.940]  And like, he's like 30 cycles deep on those things.
[02:20:18.940 --> 02:20:19.940]  You know what I mean?
[02:20:20.940 --> 02:20:24.940]  Yeah. Shout out to him, actually. His Instagram was another way that I felt like kept me going on that path.
[02:20:25.940 --> 02:20:29.940]  Actually, speaking of breeders, I actually just got some of his gear that I'm really excited about.
[02:20:30.500 --> 02:20:34.500]  And, you know, I just, I love his, you know, mob seeds.
[02:20:35.500 --> 02:20:36.500]  That's a good one.
[02:20:37.500 --> 02:20:40.500]  And he's got some, I love because he's got the old school lineages, you know, he's got Acapulco Gold,
[02:20:41.500 --> 02:20:48.500]  he's got the One, and he's got, you know, a bunch of these kind of heirloom genetics, you know, that are,
[02:20:49.500 --> 02:20:52.500]  I mean, they're comparable with anything that's on the market right now.
[02:20:53.500 --> 02:20:56.500]  And it's, you know, nothing, nothing superficial about it.
[02:20:57.500 --> 02:20:58.500]  That dude, that dude kills it.
[02:20:59.060 --> 02:21:01.060]  So there's a lot of good breeders.
[02:21:02.060 --> 02:21:06.060]  I'd love to, there's a lot of guys around, around here in Colorado, Peter, that we can talk to.
[02:21:07.060 --> 02:21:11.060]  Yeah. Cause I feel like it's almost like if you don't have the right platform for whatever reason,
[02:21:12.060 --> 02:21:18.060]  you know, or if your focus was kind of that outlaw market for a long time, how do you, how do you get that platform?
[02:21:19.060 --> 02:21:20.060]  Right.
[02:21:21.060 --> 02:21:22.060]  And the hype stuff is kind of easy to see.
[02:21:23.060 --> 02:21:27.060]  You know, you go to the different expos, you walk around the different booths, you kind of see from year to year,
[02:21:27.620 --> 02:21:28.620]  you know, one booth is huge.
[02:21:29.620 --> 02:21:32.620]  And then you go the next year and there's also the attitude of the breeder.
[02:21:33.620 --> 02:21:40.620]  You know, I've personally seen some breeders act a complete fool where like everybody around was kind of taken back by their actions and stuff.
[02:21:41.620 --> 02:21:43.620]  And I feel like that trickled down to the community.
[02:21:44.620 --> 02:21:50.620]  So there's a lot of things that I think contribute to that, where the industry as a whole,
[02:21:51.620 --> 02:21:55.620]  sometimes might just be like, man, this guy's kind of, I don't want to support him.
[02:21:56.180 --> 02:21:57.180]  Totally.
[02:21:58.180 --> 02:22:00.180]  Yeah. Was that a tactful way to say that?
[02:22:01.180 --> 02:22:02.180]  I felt like that was.
[02:22:03.180 --> 02:22:05.180]  That was very tactful without actually mentioning it.
[02:22:06.180 --> 02:22:08.180]  Cause I was going to ask, I was like, so who is a big dick?
[02:22:09.180 --> 02:22:16.180]  I don't, I don't, I don't want to do that kind of stuff, but I do want you guys to know that it's behind the scenes.
[02:22:17.180 --> 02:22:18.180]  It's some bullshit sometimes.
[02:22:19.180 --> 02:22:24.180]  And if you do grow at scale and you are growing some of those hypes and you perm out your,
[02:22:24.740 --> 02:22:26.740]  three fourths of your crop or something like that.
[02:22:27.740 --> 02:22:31.740]  I'm amazed at how many people kind of sometimes keep that to themselves.
[02:22:32.740 --> 02:22:37.740]  Where in reality, I guess, I don't know how I feel about that on talent on stuff,
[02:22:38.740 --> 02:22:43.740]  but some people need to know that there are certain breeders out there where if you're really running their genetics,
[02:22:44.740 --> 02:22:48.740]  in my opinion, it doesn't leave up to the hype, especially for the price points.
[02:22:49.740 --> 02:22:50.740]  I have no doubt about that.
[02:22:51.740 --> 02:22:52.740]  I mean, I feel the same way.
[02:22:53.300 --> 02:22:58.300]  There's a reason that, I do what I do with genetics and there's a reason I support the people I support.
[02:22:59.300 --> 02:23:03.300]  When it comes to that, because I mean, there's just stuff that,
[02:23:04.300 --> 02:23:15.300]  I don't care how many people want it or want to buy it or what trademark name or big branding is behind it.
[02:23:15.860 --> 02:23:16.860]  The proof is in the pudding.
[02:23:17.860 --> 02:23:23.860]  And if you grow in your garden and it is unstable or is, I hate to use the word unstable,
[02:23:24.860 --> 02:23:29.860]  but if it has hermaphroditic tendencies or if it has just,
[02:23:30.860 --> 02:23:33.860]  people will take a selected cut and market that.
[02:23:34.860 --> 02:23:39.860]  And then when you buy, you pop a hundred seeds and you get anything that looks like that cut.
[02:23:40.860 --> 02:23:43.860]  I feel like that is just poor breeding.
[02:23:44.420 --> 02:23:49.420]  And it's just, there are a dime a dozen these days.
[02:23:50.420 --> 02:23:53.420]  Everybody hermed out their crop from somebody's other pack of seeds.
[02:23:54.420 --> 02:23:55.420]  And now they're a breeding company.
[02:23:56.420 --> 02:23:57.420]  Now they're a seed company.
[02:23:58.420 --> 02:24:03.420]  And now it's like, you got the last year's strain crossed with the year before is that strain.
[02:24:04.420 --> 02:24:05.420]  And that's the new thing.
[02:24:06.420 --> 02:24:08.420]  And that's just, it is what it is.
[02:24:09.420 --> 02:24:11.420]  And I think there's a market for it to some degree,
[02:24:11.980 --> 02:24:14.980]  but I don't think there's any sort of longevity behind those genetics.
[02:24:15.980 --> 02:24:20.980]  And it's not some heirloom variety that my kids are going to pop when they're growing cannabis.
[02:24:21.980 --> 02:24:22.980]  People are going to forget about that shit.
[02:24:23.980 --> 02:24:29.980]  And it's at least my goal to keep stuff that my parents,
[02:24:30.980 --> 02:24:33.980]  strains that my parents told me about that they were smoking back in the day alive and around.
[02:24:34.980 --> 02:24:39.980]  Because those are the foundational stuff that everything that we've done up to this point, we're based on.
[02:24:40.540 --> 02:24:45.540]  So, you know, kind of keeping those, you know, there's a reason heirloom rare genetics are,
[02:24:46.540 --> 02:24:47.540]  you know, so valuable.
[02:24:48.540 --> 02:24:54.540]  And I think it's our duty, you know, as breeders to not just ride the train and, you know,
[02:24:55.540 --> 02:24:58.540]  really keep the old school stuff alive too.
[02:24:59.540 --> 02:25:03.540]  I mean, come up with that new genetic, but keep the old school alive.
[02:25:04.540 --> 02:25:05.540]  That's kind of how I look at it.
[02:25:06.100 --> 02:25:09.100]  I feel like when you first started out farming, you don't really,
[02:25:10.100 --> 02:25:15.100]  there's at least back in the day, there wasn't really anybody telling anybody how they were growing at first.
[02:25:16.100 --> 02:25:21.100]  So there was this kind of long learning curve with trying to understand what genetics would actually produce.
[02:25:22.100 --> 02:25:25.100]  Some genetics when I first started out, granted, it might've been also been my environment,
[02:25:26.100 --> 02:25:31.100]  would just have powdery mildew issues where I was just, I mean, that kills the entire growth.
[02:25:31.660 --> 02:25:34.660]  And we obviously Excel bills come and stuff like that.
[02:25:35.660 --> 02:25:36.660]  So how do we move past that?
[02:25:37.660 --> 02:25:38.660]  I feel like is understanding genetics.
[02:25:39.660 --> 02:25:42.660]  And if we're taking the ego out of that as just a farmer,
[02:25:43.660 --> 02:25:47.660]  we have to understand that this gentleman right here is doing a lot of that work for us
[02:25:48.660 --> 02:25:49.660]  to make us look good as a farmer.
[02:25:50.660 --> 02:25:54.660]  As long as I'm able to understand that, then I hope in time that I get good enough
[02:25:55.660 --> 02:25:57.660]  cultivating cannabis as a living soil farmer,
[02:25:58.220 --> 02:26:01.220]  that my material would be passed on to this gentleman.
[02:26:02.220 --> 02:26:04.220]  And then he would want to use my material as his canvas.
[02:26:05.220 --> 02:26:07.220]  And that should be the goal and the progression.
[02:26:08.220 --> 02:26:13.220]  The bad-ass part about this gentleman is that he could do both of that as it moves on to them.
[02:26:14.220 --> 02:26:16.220]  We're looking forward to, I think what I'm looking forward to the most
[02:26:17.220 --> 02:26:20.220]  is doing a lot of these test washes on his newest stuff that he's about to do.
[02:26:21.220 --> 02:26:23.220]  That's literally like, it's coming down, man.
[02:26:24.220 --> 02:26:25.220]  We're about to be busy.
[02:26:26.220 --> 02:26:27.220]  Let's go.
[02:26:28.220 --> 02:26:32.220]  I'm working with Nick and T for a long time.
[02:26:33.220 --> 02:26:35.220]  I'm not going to say I hit it out of the park at all.
[02:26:36.220 --> 02:26:38.220]  Because there's been tons of strains that just don't wash for shit.
[02:26:39.220 --> 02:26:45.220]  We washed a whole room of your ACDC and realized that some CBD really doesn't fucking wash.
[02:26:46.220 --> 02:26:49.220]  Less than 1% and then the Harlequin yielded 10%.
[02:26:50.220 --> 02:26:51.220]  Limoncello, same thing.
[02:26:52.220 --> 02:26:55.220]  My limoncello literally is consistently less than 1% in solvency yield.
[02:26:55.780 --> 02:26:59.780]  But we'll pull 15-20% hydrocarbon every single time.
[02:27:00.780 --> 02:27:01.780]  And the turf will shine through.
[02:27:02.780 --> 02:27:06.780]  And that's what I was getting at with my question two hours ago.
[02:27:07.780 --> 02:27:11.780]  What on the hydrocarbon front makes it a high yielder?
[02:27:12.780 --> 02:27:17.780]  I think it goes back to just tricone structure.
[02:27:18.340 --> 02:27:26.340]  If it's going to yield high in solvency, it's probably going to yield high in hydrocarbon as well.
[02:27:27.340 --> 02:27:29.340]  There are a few variables there too.
[02:27:30.340 --> 02:27:35.340]  That chem-DOG that crushes for us because it has those hardened off sandy gritty tricones.
[02:27:36.340 --> 02:27:40.340]  Does numbers for us, doesn't mean we're out yield and out terpene hydrocarbon.
[02:27:41.340 --> 02:27:42.340]  I've seen a few.
[02:27:43.340 --> 02:27:46.340]  And I think that's the hardness.
[02:27:46.900 --> 02:27:51.900]  And I think one of the things that we're lacking in the limoncello or some of these super super terpene strains.
[02:27:52.900 --> 02:27:57.900]  Why they do so well in hydrocarbon but don't do well in solvency is we're losing a lot of those terpenes to the water.
[02:27:58.900 --> 02:27:59.900]  Those tricone heads don't harden off.
[02:28:00.900 --> 02:28:05.900]  And basically those terps can extrude out of the tricone and into the water.
[02:28:06.900 --> 02:28:09.900]  You'll feel it when you, I always do this test.
[02:28:10.460 --> 02:28:14.460]  This is just kind of a total home grower test.
[02:28:15.460 --> 02:28:17.460]  But it pretty much holds true.
[02:28:18.460 --> 02:28:26.460]  If you feel your bud and the resin on your fingers is like, obviously very terpy but it's very slick almost.
[02:28:27.460 --> 02:28:32.460]  It's not tacky like your fingers are sticking together.
[02:28:33.460 --> 02:28:35.460]  There's a lot of terp in there.
[02:28:36.020 --> 02:28:41.020]  It generally washes worse in a solventless system than something that is light.
[02:28:42.020 --> 02:28:45.020]  If it's greasy, I don't even give it to nicotine.
[02:28:46.020 --> 02:28:53.020]  If it's sticky and tacky and literally my fingers are stuck and I can see the resin between them pulling apart.
[02:28:54.020 --> 02:28:57.020]  Those are the ones that I generally want to try to test wash.
[02:28:58.020 --> 02:29:03.020]  But the really really slick super terped out versus cannabinoid.
[02:29:03.580 --> 02:29:04.580]  There's something to that.
[02:29:05.580 --> 02:29:14.580]  I'm not a chemist but the terp content versus cannabinoid content and then structure of the tricone head.
[02:29:15.580 --> 02:29:21.580]  That you're either mechanically trying to extract or dissolve the waxes so that you can get to the center part of the solvent.
[02:29:22.580 --> 02:29:28.580]  It has everything to do with whether or not it does good in a solventless system versus solvent.
[02:29:29.580 --> 02:29:32.580]  Some of those tricones just don't come off the material.
[02:29:33.580 --> 02:29:38.580]  I've washed stuff and then scoped it before and scoped it after and there's still tricones with heads on them.
[02:29:39.580 --> 02:29:42.580]  I'm like fuck those ones do great in hydrocarbon.
[02:29:43.580 --> 02:29:46.580]  They're just heads that don't want to break off as easily.
[02:29:47.580 --> 02:29:51.580]  Ice in the water just doesn't mechanically separate.
[02:29:52.580 --> 02:29:54.580]  You could take that material and probably still obtain a yield.
[02:29:55.580 --> 02:30:02.580]  We've done it. We've freeze dried that material and then still blasted it and got a yield.
[02:30:03.580 --> 02:30:05.580]  There's definitely something to it.
[02:30:06.580 --> 02:30:09.580]  I think it has a lot to do with genetics as well.
[02:30:10.580 --> 02:30:11.580]  Mostly with genetics.
[02:30:12.580 --> 02:30:14.580]  If you're going to do a 0 to 100.
[02:30:15.580 --> 02:30:16.580]  Terpinoline?
[02:30:17.580 --> 02:30:20.580]  How important genetics is to the overall piece of the plan.
[02:30:21.580 --> 02:30:23.580]  Is 50% too generous?
[02:30:24.580 --> 02:30:27.580]  I want to say 100% all day.
[02:30:28.580 --> 02:30:31.580]  Obviously there's different variables.
[02:30:32.140 --> 02:30:35.140]  You can't control everything but you're starting out.
[02:30:36.140 --> 02:30:42.140]  Good genetics will shine through no matter how shitty your system is.
[02:30:43.140 --> 02:30:50.140]  Whereas if you have a super dialed in most perfect system you can get shitty genetics to look pretty good for you.
[02:30:50.700 --> 02:30:51.700]  If that makes sense.
[02:30:52.700 --> 02:30:54.700]  If it's a turd it's a turd.
[02:30:55.700 --> 02:31:02.700]  If it's good high quality genetic then you can be bare bones.
[02:31:03.700 --> 02:31:04.700]  Let it go. Not water it.
[02:31:05.700 --> 02:31:10.700]  Who knows? It will probably produce quality flour that a lot of other people may not be able to achieve with a dialed in environment.
[02:31:11.700 --> 02:31:15.700]  I think genetics are the majority of the play.
[02:31:16.260 --> 02:31:22.260]  When you're going to grow you can have the most dialed in million dollar grow.
[02:31:23.260 --> 02:31:28.260]  Every box checked when it comes to your environmental thing.
[02:31:29.260 --> 02:31:30.260]  Your nutrition, your everything.
[02:31:31.260 --> 02:31:34.260]  But you can still grow garbage because you didn't have the right genetics.
[02:31:35.260 --> 02:31:36.260]  And vice versa.
[02:31:37.260 --> 02:31:41.260]  I think 100% because you have to have some other variables.
[02:31:42.260 --> 02:31:44.260]  You have to waste 3-4 months of your life.
[02:31:44.820 --> 02:31:50.820]  And then you can get dialed in with your genetics but then for whatever reason not understand russet mice.
[02:31:51.820 --> 02:31:56.820]  Just having genetics alone is going to allow you to potentially combat some of that.
[02:31:57.820 --> 02:32:00.820]  Obviously the cannabis plant is not running away so how do we improve?
[02:32:01.820 --> 02:32:02.820]  We have to improve the overall health of the plant.
[02:32:03.820 --> 02:32:05.820]  That's why even when we were talking about chitin before.
[02:32:06.820 --> 02:32:09.820]  Understanding those concepts from day one as a farmer.
[02:32:10.380 --> 02:32:13.380]  For people listening to this tonight.
[02:32:14.380 --> 02:32:21.380]  I feel like understanding and trusting the process would be the main mission or message of tonight.
[02:32:22.380 --> 02:32:25.380]  Because it takes a long time to start to see that for yourself.
[02:32:26.380 --> 02:32:29.380]  Unless you go out and get a worm bin and start to mess around with those composting worms.
[02:32:30.380 --> 02:32:31.380]  You start to build up those spring tail mice.
[02:32:32.380 --> 02:32:36.380]  You start to see that rove beetles for whatever reason seem to appear if you're using quality humus.
[02:32:36.940 --> 02:32:41.940]  Then taking it to the next level where maybe you're just using your compost teas as a foiler feed.
[02:32:42.940 --> 02:32:45.940]  You're using extracts to keep that process going.
[02:32:46.940 --> 02:32:49.940]  Once you understand that biodiversity is key.
[02:32:50.940 --> 02:32:52.940]  It's kind of off to the races.
[02:32:53.940 --> 02:32:56.940]  That's when you're able to forget about and focus so much on pH levels.
[02:32:57.940 --> 02:32:58.940]  Parts per million.
[02:32:59.940 --> 02:33:00.940]  You just trust that process.
[02:33:01.500 --> 02:33:02.500]  For a lot of those guys out there.
[02:33:03.500 --> 02:33:09.500]  I feel like they want to be able to cultivate in their tent or in their basement with terpenes in mind.
[02:33:10.500 --> 02:33:13.500]  I feel like genetics has got to be half of that.
[02:33:14.500 --> 02:33:17.500]  Living soil is our opinion.
[02:33:18.500 --> 02:33:19.500]  The way to achieve that.
[02:33:20.500 --> 02:33:25.500]  Especially if you don't understand the cannabis plant on a whole other level using synthetics.
[02:33:26.500 --> 02:33:29.500]  There's a lot of fantastic farmers out there that farm that way.
[02:33:30.060 --> 02:33:34.060]  I felt like trusting mother nature was a better outlet for me.
[02:33:35.060 --> 02:33:40.060]  When I first started out growing with an aeroponic system and using house and garden products.
[02:33:41.060 --> 02:33:43.060]  I was growing mids at best.
[02:33:44.060 --> 02:33:47.060]  It was always a race to try to push that product.
[02:33:48.060 --> 02:33:50.060]  Once we started to focus on terpenes.
[02:33:51.060 --> 02:33:56.060]  That's where I felt like we could start to outcompete all of the dispensaries that started to show up.
[02:33:56.620 --> 02:33:59.620]  Now the market seems to catch up with that years later.
[02:34:00.620 --> 02:34:03.620]  Nobody's really talking about Briggs levels.
[02:34:04.620 --> 02:34:07.620]  Now I feel like that's starting to be the concept.
[02:34:08.620 --> 02:34:10.620]  Definitely people weren't saying living soil before.
[02:34:11.620 --> 02:34:13.620]  It was no-till, maybe low-till.
[02:34:14.620 --> 02:34:18.620]  I feel like the correct terminology in my opinion.
[02:34:19.620 --> 02:34:22.620]  When you're using composting worms and you're not amending stuff.
[02:34:23.620 --> 02:34:24.620]  You're using a cover crop.
[02:34:25.180 --> 02:34:26.180]  That should be a living soil.
[02:34:27.180 --> 02:34:29.180]  If you're amending things after each grow.
[02:34:30.180 --> 02:34:31.180]  To me that's not a living soil.
[02:34:32.180 --> 02:34:34.180]  I know there's a big debate on that with some people around here in Denver.
[02:34:35.180 --> 02:34:40.180]  If you're continuing to pull up those roots and amend things at the end of your grow.
[02:34:41.180 --> 02:34:44.180]  That's the exact opposite in my opinion of what living soil was about.
[02:34:45.180 --> 02:34:49.180]  It's almost like you got to take a step back and just allow the system.
[02:34:50.180 --> 02:34:51.180]  We're not really farmer anymore.
[02:34:52.180 --> 02:34:53.180]  We're more like coach.
[02:34:53.740 --> 02:34:54.740]  We just make sure that we're managing everything.
[02:34:55.740 --> 02:34:57.740]  Once we've managed everything we can take that step back.
[02:34:58.740 --> 02:35:02.740]  And continue to scope or continue to improve the overall education of our team.
[02:35:03.740 --> 02:35:05.740]  So that we don't have russet mice and spider mice.
[02:35:06.740 --> 02:35:08.740]  Things that fuck up a major commercial grow.
[02:35:09.740 --> 02:35:11.740]  But in a 30 gallon pot.
[02:35:13.740 --> 02:35:16.740]  Living soil versus amending.
[02:35:19.740 --> 02:35:20.740]  It's a very fine line.
[02:35:21.300 --> 02:35:22.300]  Pretty much any indoor agriculture.
[02:35:23.300 --> 02:35:26.300]  Eventually you're going to have to put inputs in there.
[02:35:27.300 --> 02:35:29.300]  You're going to have to add organic matter.
[02:35:30.300 --> 02:35:31.300]  Eventually you're going to have to.
[02:35:32.300 --> 02:35:33.300]  Obviously in ground one thing.
[02:35:34.300 --> 02:35:35.300]  If you have a big enough bed.
[02:35:36.300 --> 02:35:38.300]  Maybe you could have enough mineral nutrition in there.
[02:35:39.300 --> 02:35:42.300]  Packed in there for 5, 6, 10 years.
[02:35:43.300 --> 02:35:47.300]  But organic matter is something that you constantly have to replenish.
[02:35:48.300 --> 02:35:50.300]  Because that's what's getting cycled and turned into food.
[02:35:51.300 --> 02:35:54.300]  And turned into the organic plant matter.
[02:35:55.300 --> 02:35:56.300]  That is growing.
[02:35:57.300 --> 02:35:58.300]  It doesn't come out of thin air.
[02:35:59.300 --> 02:36:04.300]  The idea of an indoor true no-till system.
[02:36:05.300 --> 02:36:06.300]  Permanent no-till system.
[02:36:07.300 --> 02:36:10.300]  Is difficult to achieve.
[02:36:11.300 --> 02:36:13.300]  There's obviously going to be.
[02:36:14.300 --> 02:36:15.300]  You've got to have inputs.
[02:36:16.300 --> 02:36:17.300]  If you can achieve that perfect balance.
[02:36:17.860 --> 02:36:20.860]  To where you can grow your plants.
[02:36:21.860 --> 02:36:24.860]  And you can use the cuttings and the stalks.
[02:36:25.860 --> 02:36:27.860]  And the biomass that plant produces.
[02:36:28.860 --> 02:36:32.860]  To then be your input of organic matter.
[02:36:33.860 --> 02:36:36.860]  Then I think there's some great examples out there.
[02:36:37.860 --> 02:36:39.860]  Arlo systems being one of them.
[02:36:40.860 --> 02:36:42.860]  But eventually.
[02:36:43.860 --> 02:36:46.860]  You're going to have to add something.
[02:36:47.860 --> 02:36:51.860]  And a true closed loop system.
[02:36:52.860 --> 02:36:54.860]  Is almost impossible to achieve.
[02:36:55.860 --> 02:36:57.860]  If you're container gardening.
[02:36:58.860 --> 02:37:00.860]  Now that's arguable.
[02:37:01.860 --> 02:37:03.860]  I would say if you're growing outdoors.
[02:37:04.860 --> 02:37:05.860]  Or you're field growing or something like that.
[02:37:06.860 --> 02:37:09.860]  You can get to a point where you never have to add anything ever again.
[02:37:10.860 --> 02:37:11.860]  Outside of what's on your farm.
[02:37:12.860 --> 02:37:13.860]  But these things.
[02:37:14.420 --> 02:37:17.420]  It takes energy to make the plant.
[02:37:18.420 --> 02:37:20.420]  And then you got to replenish that energy somewhere.
[02:37:21.420 --> 02:37:22.420]  If you're not literally just growing a plant.
[02:37:23.420 --> 02:37:24.420]  And composting it back in the soil.
[02:37:25.420 --> 02:37:26.420]  Which we're not.
[02:37:27.420 --> 02:37:28.420]  We're cutting the flower off.
[02:37:29.420 --> 02:37:30.420]  We're taking that.
[02:37:31.420 --> 02:37:32.420]  It's moving around.
[02:37:33.420 --> 02:37:34.420]  That flower is not being given in return back to the soil.
[02:37:35.420 --> 02:37:37.420]  You have to give back at some point.
[02:37:38.420 --> 02:37:41.420]  So I do think trusting mother nature.
[02:37:42.420 --> 02:37:43.420]  And trusting the system is the way to go.
[02:37:44.420 --> 02:37:49.420]  And I do also know that all this stuff is backed by science.
[02:37:50.420 --> 02:37:51.420]  I'm a biologist.
[02:37:52.420 --> 02:37:54.420]  We're more biologists than we are chemists.
[02:37:55.420 --> 02:37:56.420]  Ultimately.
[02:37:57.420 --> 02:37:59.420]  And Living Soil people are not going to like to hear this.
[02:38:00.420 --> 02:38:02.420]  But you can achieve the same results.
[02:38:03.420 --> 02:38:04.420]  With salt.
[02:38:05.420 --> 02:38:06.420]  But you have to be.
[02:38:07.420 --> 02:38:08.420]  You got to be perfect.
[02:38:09.420 --> 02:38:10.420]  And you have to.
[02:38:11.420 --> 02:38:12.420]  That sort of thing.
[02:38:12.980 --> 02:38:15.980]  And it is a lot more energy expensive on the earth.
[02:38:16.980 --> 02:38:17.980]  And on you.
[02:38:18.980 --> 02:38:19.980]  And your time.
[02:38:20.980 --> 02:38:21.980]  And you know.
[02:38:22.980 --> 02:38:23.980]  All the.
[02:38:24.980 --> 02:38:25.980]  When you add up the true cost of like a bottle of nutrient.
[02:38:26.980 --> 02:38:27.980]  Or a bag of petroleum salts.
[02:38:28.980 --> 02:38:31.980]  Versus the biology that a Living Soil system produces.
[02:38:32.980 --> 02:38:33.980]  You know.
[02:38:34.980 --> 02:38:35.980]  Then your cost.
[02:38:36.980 --> 02:38:37.980]  You know.
[02:38:37.980 --> 02:38:38.980]  Becomes a lot less than a Living Soil system.
[02:38:39.980 --> 02:38:40.980]  But ultimately the plant.
[02:38:41.540 --> 02:38:42.540]  When it comes to the chemistry of it.
[02:38:43.540 --> 02:38:44.540]  The plant doesn't care.
[02:38:45.540 --> 02:38:46.540]  Whether it was made with.
[02:38:47.540 --> 02:38:48.540]  You know.
[02:38:49.540 --> 02:38:50.540]  And by the way.
[02:38:51.540 --> 02:38:52.540]  After this I want Nick to take the contrarian.
[02:38:53.540 --> 02:38:54.540]  Hydro viewpoint.
[02:38:55.540 --> 02:38:56.540]  Well.
[02:38:57.540 --> 02:38:59.540]  We kind of briefly touched on that.
[02:39:00.540 --> 02:39:01.540]  Right before this started.
[02:39:02.540 --> 02:39:03.540]  It's like.
[02:39:04.540 --> 02:39:05.540]  From my viewpoint.
[02:39:06.540 --> 02:39:07.540]  I really.
[02:39:08.540 --> 02:39:09.540]  It's very very hard to see the difference.
[02:39:10.100 --> 02:39:11.100]  Between a plant that's running on salt.
[02:39:12.100 --> 02:39:13.100]  But flushing them properly.
[02:39:14.100 --> 02:39:15.100]  Compared to somebody that's running soil.
[02:39:16.100 --> 02:39:17.100]  Now when we're talking about.
[02:39:18.100 --> 02:39:19.100]  Greg's Living Soil.
[02:39:20.100 --> 02:39:21.100]  And some of my friends Living Soil.
[02:39:22.100 --> 02:39:23.100]  I can really taste a difference in the flowers.
[02:39:24.100 --> 02:39:25.100]  For sure.
[02:39:26.100 --> 02:39:27.100]  I feel like the flowers hold a lot more moisture.
[02:39:28.100 --> 02:39:29.100]  Which then can hold a lot more of these.
[02:39:30.100 --> 02:39:31.100]  You know.
[02:39:32.100 --> 02:39:33.100]  Salt and any other things that people are.
[02:39:34.100 --> 02:39:35.100]  Feeding.
[02:39:36.100 --> 02:39:37.100]  And at that point in the flower form.
[02:39:38.100 --> 02:39:39.100]  I can.
[02:39:40.100 --> 02:39:41.100]  Definitely tell the difference.
[02:39:42.100 --> 02:39:43.100]  So.
[02:39:44.100 --> 02:39:45.100]  I just wanted to touch on that.
[02:39:46.100 --> 02:39:47.100]  Yeah.
[02:39:47.100 --> 02:39:48.100]  What are you saying when you wash?
[02:39:49.100 --> 02:39:50.100]  Like.
[02:39:51.100 --> 02:39:52.100]  Yeah.
[02:39:52.100 --> 02:39:53.100]  When I'm washing one versus the other.
[02:39:54.100 --> 02:39:55.100]  If it's a proper growing grower.
[02:39:56.100 --> 02:39:57.100]  Growing with just A and B.
[02:39:58.100 --> 02:39:59.100]  It's really hard for me to tell the difference.
[02:40:00.100 --> 02:40:01.100]  Compared to Living Soil.
[02:40:02.100 --> 02:40:03.100]  100%.
[02:40:04.100 --> 02:40:05.100]  So.
[02:40:06.100 --> 02:40:07.100]  That's interesting.
[02:40:07.100 --> 02:40:08.100]  So basically you can get what you're happy with.
[02:40:08.660 --> 02:40:09.660]  From either environment.
[02:40:10.660 --> 02:40:11.660]  Yeah.
[02:40:11.660 --> 02:40:12.660]  When you smoke it as a flower.
[02:40:13.660 --> 02:40:14.660]  You're like I noticed a difference.
[02:40:15.660 --> 02:40:16.660]  Yeah.
[02:40:16.660 --> 02:40:17.660]  And then oftentimes when I'm washing it.
[02:40:18.660 --> 02:40:19.660]  You know.
[02:40:20.660 --> 02:40:21.660]  If these salt growers aren't flushing properly.
[02:40:22.660 --> 02:40:23.660]  Or they want to take it early for hash.
[02:40:24.660 --> 02:40:25.660]  And things like that.
[02:40:26.660 --> 02:40:27.660]  I really notice.
[02:40:28.660 --> 02:40:29.660]  You know.
[02:40:30.660 --> 02:40:31.660]  So the benefit of growing with Living Soil.
[02:40:32.660 --> 02:40:33.660]  Or no till or any of these methods.
[02:40:34.660 --> 02:40:35.660]  Is you're not going to have that problem.
[02:40:36.660 --> 02:40:37.660]  No matter what.
[02:40:38.220 --> 02:40:39.220]  You're not going to get involved.
[02:40:40.220 --> 02:40:41.220]  In Living Soil medium.
[02:40:42.220 --> 02:40:43.220]  So.
[02:40:43.220 --> 02:40:44.220]  Yeah.
[02:40:44.220 --> 02:40:45.220]  There's that.
[02:40:46.220 --> 02:40:47.220]  There's nothing really to flush.
[02:40:48.220 --> 02:40:49.220]  Yeah.
[02:40:49.220 --> 02:40:50.220]  There's you know.
[02:40:51.220 --> 02:40:52.220]  You're flushing your valuable.
[02:40:53.220 --> 02:40:54.220]  Microbiology.
[02:40:54.220 --> 02:40:55.220]  Organic.
[02:40:55.220 --> 02:40:56.220]  That are down the drain.
[02:40:57.220 --> 02:40:58.220]  I mean I've seen with some like bottled farmers.
[02:40:59.220 --> 02:41:00.220]  I mean I taste and see in the extract.
[02:41:01.220 --> 02:41:02.220]  And like really suffer from yield.
[02:41:03.220 --> 02:41:04.220]  When we see like.
[02:41:05.220 --> 02:41:06.220]  You know just heavy salt form formulas.
[02:41:06.780 --> 02:41:07.780]  Heavy sugar formulas.
[02:41:08.780 --> 02:41:09.780]  And then also there's certain bottled nutrient companies.
[02:41:10.780 --> 02:41:11.780]  That have lime cleaners.
[02:41:12.780 --> 02:41:13.780]  And things like that.
[02:41:14.780 --> 02:41:15.780]  That I really pick up in the extract form.
[02:41:16.780 --> 02:41:17.780]  Like if you're using a lime cleaner.
[02:41:18.780 --> 02:41:19.780]  Like there's a few brands that I can think of.
[02:41:20.780 --> 02:41:21.780]  Right off the top of my head.
[02:41:22.780 --> 02:41:23.780]  That I can seriously distinguish in flavor.
[02:41:24.780 --> 02:41:25.780]  You're not rinsing that lime cleaner through afterwards.
[02:41:26.780 --> 02:41:27.780]  I notice it.
[02:41:28.780 --> 02:41:29.780]  100 percent.
[02:41:30.780 --> 02:41:31.780]  I see with sweeteners too.
[02:41:32.780 --> 02:41:33.780]  Yeah.
[02:41:33.780 --> 02:41:34.780]  Oh yeah.
[02:41:35.340 --> 02:41:36.340]  You get that like burnt feeling in your throat.
[02:41:37.340 --> 02:41:38.340]  Or there's certain profiles that come out in the flower.
[02:41:39.340 --> 02:41:40.340]  That you're like this is not.
[02:41:41.340 --> 02:41:42.340]  What flower would have been producing.
[02:41:43.340 --> 02:41:44.340]  This is an ester.
[02:41:45.340 --> 02:41:46.340]  That was you know metabolized into this thing.
[02:41:47.340 --> 02:41:48.340]  You know that was added.
[02:41:49.340 --> 02:41:50.340]  Right at the end.
[02:41:51.340 --> 02:41:52.340]  Yeah.
[02:41:52.340 --> 02:41:53.340]  You see like crazy white buds.
[02:41:54.340 --> 02:41:55.340]  And stuff from some of these bottled nutrient companies.
[02:41:56.340 --> 02:41:57.340]  But when you go to extract it.
[02:41:58.340 --> 02:41:59.340]  That white is just really due to all the waxes.
[02:42:00.340 --> 02:42:01.340]  That it's created.
[02:42:02.340 --> 02:42:03.340]  And really didn't have time to get rid of.
[02:42:03.900 --> 02:42:04.900]  And really didn't have time.
[02:42:05.900 --> 02:42:06.900]  The plant didn't have time to convert those waxes into oils.
[02:42:07.900 --> 02:42:08.900]  Oils way more.
[02:42:09.900 --> 02:42:10.900]  So we would actually see the yield we were desiring.
[02:42:11.900 --> 02:42:12.900]  If they converted.
[02:42:13.900 --> 02:42:14.900]  But they didn't.
[02:42:15.900 --> 02:42:16.900]  Waxes don't have as many terpenes.
[02:42:17.900 --> 02:42:18.900]  So just a lot of variables that attribute to bad product.
[02:42:19.900 --> 02:42:20.900]  Bad viability.
[02:42:21.900 --> 02:42:22.900]  Isn't that like the OG trick is to take it early.
[02:42:23.900 --> 02:42:24.900]  I mean.
[02:42:25.900 --> 02:42:26.900]  Take it.
[02:42:27.900 --> 02:42:28.900]  There's certain strains that will perform well.
[02:42:29.900 --> 02:42:30.900]  Certain cultivars that will perform well.
[02:42:31.900 --> 02:42:32.900]  If you take a bunch of them.
[02:42:33.900 --> 02:42:34.900]  Take them early.
[02:42:35.900 --> 02:42:36.900]  Oftentimes the chems do okay early.
[02:42:37.900 --> 02:42:38.900]  You get a really really light color.
[02:42:39.900 --> 02:42:40.900]  But then there's other strains.
[02:42:41.900 --> 02:42:42.900]  That don't have the time.
[02:42:43.900 --> 02:42:44.900]  To actually produce that trichome head.
[02:42:45.900 --> 02:42:46.900]  So we really promote using a scope.
[02:42:47.900 --> 02:42:48.900]  In fact I was doing a virtual tour.
[02:42:49.900 --> 02:42:50.900]  Just three days ago.
[02:42:51.900 --> 02:42:52.900]  In Calaveras County.
[02:42:53.900 --> 02:42:54.900]  And I was like yo scope them.
[02:42:55.900 --> 02:42:56.900]  Because these are all grease monkeys.
[02:42:57.900 --> 02:42:58.900]  That I'm looking at right now.
[02:42:59.900 --> 02:43:00.900]  And we're like 10 days.
[02:43:01.900 --> 02:43:02.900]  No we're I think like two weeks.
[02:43:03.900 --> 02:43:04.900]  Away from when he would normally.
[02:43:05.900 --> 02:43:06.900]  Chop them for flour.
[02:43:07.900 --> 02:43:08.900]  And my scope now please.
[02:43:09.900 --> 02:43:10.900]  You know like it might be right.
[02:43:11.900 --> 02:43:12.900]  And sure enough they were right.
[02:43:13.900 --> 02:43:14.900]  Even had some cloudy ones.
[02:43:15.900 --> 02:43:16.900]  Because certain strains just mature faster.
[02:43:17.900 --> 02:43:18.900]  In certain environments of course.
[02:43:19.900 --> 02:43:20.900]  You know terroir.
[02:43:21.900 --> 02:43:22.900]  It's interesting to hear from your point of view.
[02:43:23.900 --> 02:43:24.900]  On that man.
[02:43:25.900 --> 02:43:26.900]  Because there's a lot of like.
[02:43:27.900 --> 02:43:28.900]  Bro stuff that we tried to share with one another.
[02:43:29.900 --> 02:43:30.900]  That we never really had as a fact.
[02:43:31.900 --> 02:43:32.900]  To know at your skill level.
[02:43:33.900 --> 02:43:34.900]  It's not even just skill.
[02:43:35.900 --> 02:43:36.900]  Like I just am blessed to have experience.
[02:43:37.900 --> 02:43:38.900]  Washing so many different things over the years.
[02:43:39.900 --> 02:43:40.900]  You know and still every day.
[02:43:41.900 --> 02:43:42.900]  I'm learning more and more.
[02:43:43.900 --> 02:43:44.900]  This has been an amazing thing for me.
[02:43:45.900 --> 02:43:46.900]  Because I learned a ton from Greg.
[02:43:47.900 --> 02:43:48.900]  I've known the guy for 20 years.
[02:43:49.900 --> 02:43:50.900]  Yeah Greg.
[02:43:51.900 --> 02:43:52.900]  Hell yeah man.
[02:43:53.900 --> 02:43:54.900]  That's why we wanted to do this buddy.
[02:43:55.900 --> 02:43:56.900]  I appreciate it.
[02:43:57.900 --> 02:43:58.900]  Just a dude.
[02:43:59.900 --> 02:44:00.900]  Trying to grow the best weed I can.
[02:44:01.460 --> 02:44:02.460]  That's on your tombstone.
[02:44:03.460 --> 02:44:04.460]  People are asking what kind of scope.
[02:44:05.460 --> 02:44:06.460]  Real quick in the chat.
[02:44:07.460 --> 02:44:08.460]  I mean anything that's like 30 times.
[02:44:09.460 --> 02:44:10.460]  Is going to be just fine.
[02:44:11.460 --> 02:44:12.460]  To see your trikes 30 times.
[02:44:13.460 --> 02:44:14.460]  And I really like those handheld.
[02:44:15.460 --> 02:44:16.460]  Battery operated ones.
[02:44:17.460 --> 02:44:18.460]  You know.
[02:44:19.460 --> 02:44:20.460]  You can go out in the field with them.
[02:44:21.460 --> 02:44:22.460]  You don't have to bring your computer.
[02:44:23.460 --> 02:44:24.460]  They've got a little dial on them.
[02:44:25.460 --> 02:44:26.460]  And a light.
[02:44:27.460 --> 02:44:28.460]  The LED light is pretty key for trichrome heads.
[02:44:29.460 --> 02:44:30.460]  So yeah.
[02:44:31.460 --> 02:44:32.460]  Little lighted microscope.
[02:44:33.460 --> 02:44:34.460]  They're like 19 bucks.
[02:44:35.460 --> 02:44:36.460]  I think I even saw them as low as 8 bucks on Amazon.
[02:44:37.460 --> 02:44:38.460]  To be honest.
[02:44:39.460 --> 02:44:40.460]  Check it.
[02:44:41.460 --> 02:44:49.460]  DK said can I call Living Soil a soilless pro mix that was amended super soil style.
[02:44:52.460 --> 02:44:53.460]  Does it have.
[02:44:54.460 --> 02:44:56.460]  My question would be does it have the living components of that.
[02:44:57.460 --> 02:44:58.460]  Are you running the composting worms.
[02:44:59.020 --> 02:45:00.020]  And all of the variables of building that soil food web.
[02:45:01.020 --> 02:45:02.020]  So that you're having diversity.
[02:45:03.020 --> 02:45:04.020]  Or are you focused on NPK methods.
[02:45:05.020 --> 02:45:06.020]  Because I feel like that's.
[02:45:07.020 --> 02:45:08.020]  You can't have one or the other.
[02:45:09.020 --> 02:45:10.020]  In my opinion.
[02:45:11.020 --> 02:45:12.020]  When you're trying to build these out.
[02:45:13.020 --> 02:45:16.020]  I feel like super soil is the step just before living or like living soil.
[02:45:17.020 --> 02:45:20.020]  You know super soil is just pumping all of the.
[02:45:21.020 --> 02:45:22.020]  You know the hard stuff into it.
[02:45:23.020 --> 02:45:24.020]  The hardware.
[02:45:25.020 --> 02:45:26.020]  You know I mean.
[02:45:26.580 --> 02:45:29.580]  Like all your your NPKs and your you know your humus and your.
[02:45:30.580 --> 02:45:34.580]  You know organic matter and your substrate your aeration your biochar and all this stuff.
[02:45:35.580 --> 02:45:38.580]  But it's lacking the biology and the diversity of living organisms in it.
[02:45:39.580 --> 02:45:40.580]  That we were for you to.
[02:45:41.580 --> 02:45:44.580]  We talked about living organisms living organic soil or just living soil in general.
[02:45:45.580 --> 02:45:47.580]  You know it has other things.
[02:45:48.580 --> 02:45:50.580]  Other than other plants other than the cannabis living in it.
[02:45:51.580 --> 02:45:54.580]  It has all the microbiology that you would see in a plant.
[02:45:55.140 --> 02:45:56.140]  It has all the microbiology that you would see.
[02:45:57.140 --> 02:45:59.140]  You know maybe not all but a lot of the biology that you would see.
[02:46:00.140 --> 02:46:03.140]  In a healthy soil in the ground outside.
[02:46:04.140 --> 02:46:05.140]  You know it has all your levels.
[02:46:06.140 --> 02:46:07.140]  You know of.
[02:46:08.140 --> 02:46:09.140]  Biology in there from.
[02:46:10.140 --> 02:46:16.140]  You know bacteria to fungus to your macros with your earthworms and roly polys and springtails and roe beetles.
[02:46:17.140 --> 02:46:21.140]  You know you're all these things are eating on you know the food it's got the full food chain.
[02:46:22.140 --> 02:46:23.140]  You know of organisms in there.
[02:46:23.700 --> 02:46:24.700]  That's what we talk about living soil.
[02:46:25.700 --> 02:46:28.700]  That's what we're talking about literally living like you grab a handful of it.
[02:46:29.700 --> 02:46:30.700]  You can see it moving in your hands.
[02:46:31.700 --> 02:46:34.700]  You can put it under a microscope and it is just going nuts.
[02:46:35.700 --> 02:46:41.700]  You know if it's not if it's not moving and it's not digesting you know itself.
[02:46:42.700 --> 02:46:44.700]  You know then I wouldn't say that it's a true living soil.
[02:46:45.700 --> 02:46:46.700]  Now there's lots of debates about this.
[02:46:47.700 --> 02:46:51.700]  I think you can have fungally dominant or bacterial dominant or less diversity in.
[02:46:52.260 --> 02:46:57.260]  It's still technically living but you know the more diverse of a living soil you have the better.
[02:46:58.260 --> 02:47:05.260]  Honestly a great you know what what dude said about you know pro mix with a bunch of super soil amendments.
[02:47:06.260 --> 02:47:07.260]  That's how you start.
[02:47:08.260 --> 02:47:11.260]  You know you mix that up and you add the biology and then boom you got living soil.
[02:47:12.260 --> 02:47:21.260]  You know but other than that if you don't add the biology and it's not you know alive then you're you know you're just rocking a super new soil.
[02:47:22.260 --> 02:47:27.260]  You know nutrient packed medium that isn't going to be self-sufficient.
[02:47:28.260 --> 02:47:33.260]  I feel like that might also have been what kind of gave living soil a bad name at first is because that set up.
[02:47:34.260 --> 02:47:37.260]  You're going to more than likely run out of gas by the end of that.
[02:47:38.260 --> 02:47:46.260]  And so then people would be like you know I grew up with a you know I had a living soil added the super soil and my plants were deficient as can be.
[02:47:46.820 --> 02:47:55.820]  I think that's what takes it to the next level is understanding that you're going to have to build up that microbial life that's going to have to eat that organic matter to break things down.
[02:47:56.820 --> 02:48:03.820]  Otherwise the actual hunger of the cannabis plant that the beginning of a microbial world if it's really not there at all.
[02:48:04.820 --> 02:48:07.820]  There's no way that's going to keep up especially in a first flip.
[02:48:08.820 --> 02:48:09.820]  Do you have more to add to that?
[02:48:10.820 --> 02:48:14.820]  I feel like you you've grown more on like a larger scale for that method.
[02:48:15.380 --> 02:48:16.380]  Well I mean absolutely.
[02:48:17.380 --> 02:48:23.380]  I mean with it's when it's just dealing with you know nutrient inputs like cannabis is a heavy plant.
[02:48:24.380 --> 02:48:28.380]  You know what I mean it's I wouldn't say it needs say as much nitrogen or something as like corn.
[02:48:29.380 --> 02:48:34.380]  But you it is by no means a you know finicky eater.
[02:48:35.380 --> 02:48:39.380]  It wants to eat everything and it'll take high doses of nutrition.
[02:48:39.940 --> 02:48:48.940]  So you know if you don't have something replenishing your nutrition or you know kind of making you know a lot of these soils it's not that they run out of food.
[02:48:49.940 --> 02:48:53.940]  It's that they run out of available food and they don't have anything that'll turn it into available again.
[02:48:54.940 --> 02:48:59.940]  So it's like that super soils needs to be charged up with some biology and boom nutrition still in it.
[02:49:00.940 --> 02:49:07.940]  You know it's just a matter of you know it runs out of available MPKs and all that shit.
[02:49:08.500 --> 02:49:09.500]  And it's not plant available.
[02:49:10.500 --> 02:49:13.500]  There's nothing to make it plant available and chelate those nutrients that are already there.
[02:49:14.500 --> 02:49:20.500]  You know so it's like it totally runs out of gas or it's got too much available nutrient when you cook it.
[02:49:21.500 --> 02:49:27.500]  It's got too much available nutrient at first and you just get all that kind of lockout or burn you know because your nutrients are imbalanced.
[02:49:28.500 --> 02:49:31.500]  You know so I think it's a good start.
[02:49:32.500 --> 02:49:37.500]  But you gotta you know we're talking living systems are you know supposed to be have lots of longevity.
[02:49:38.500 --> 02:49:46.500]  You know and they're supposed to be low input you know obviously some inputs but they're supposed to continue to do their thing over and over.
[02:49:47.500 --> 02:49:51.500]  It's closing those loops to where you don't have to continually add outside sources of stuff.
[02:49:52.500 --> 02:49:57.500]  You know bottle nutrients or whatever you know eventually gets to more self-sustaining system.
[02:49:58.500 --> 02:50:00.500]  That's the goal is to like just keep making it more.
[02:50:01.500 --> 02:50:07.500]  Keep adding less and achieving more you know if that's a possible thing you know.
[02:50:08.500 --> 02:50:17.500]  So yeah the living stir sorry the super soil systems at scale you know like we used to do that at Pink House when I was working there.
[02:50:18.500 --> 02:50:24.500]  You know we couldn't get through more than one round with our soil even though it was nutrient dense.
[02:50:25.500 --> 02:50:29.500]  You know because we didn't have enough biology to recycle and keep it rocking you know.
[02:50:30.500 --> 02:50:33.500]  So it's like we that's the biggest problem at the larger level.
[02:50:34.060 --> 02:50:39.060]  And then generally not to you know most people don't grow on beds that grow big commercial gardens.
[02:50:40.060 --> 02:50:43.060]  You know they grow in containers you know usually it's like a five gallon container.
[02:50:44.060 --> 02:50:47.060]  Maybe you'll get a 10 or 15 gallon container you know plastic container.
[02:50:48.060 --> 02:50:55.060]  And those just are not like there's not enough mass to continually sustain.
[02:50:56.060 --> 02:50:58.060]  I mean there's some people that I guarantee proven wrong there.
[02:50:58.620 --> 02:51:07.620]  But it just seems to me at scale you know if you want to do a living system like you're beyond traditional container garden at that point.
[02:51:08.620 --> 02:51:13.620]  You know then you need higher volumes of this stuff because cannabis eats a lot.
[02:51:14.620 --> 02:51:23.620]  And that's why you can feed it you know like salt you can feed it a thousand ppm 1500 ppm you know of available nutrient you know.
[02:51:24.180 --> 02:51:30.180]  And it'll take it you know but that's you know I don't know what you're doing on a living system.
[02:51:31.180 --> 02:51:34.180]  It's like the plant needs to be able to take what it wants when it wants to.
[02:51:35.180 --> 02:51:38.180]  And it's less is more in these sort of systems you know.
[02:51:39.180 --> 02:51:44.180]  So Greg what type of tests are you personally doing like you're doing soil tests.
[02:51:45.180 --> 02:51:50.180]  Are you doing like sap analysis and things where it's like it's great whatever is available in the soil.
[02:51:50.740 --> 02:51:53.740]  But let's see what the plants actually able to take up.
[02:51:54.740 --> 02:52:00.740]  Yeah no I mean I'm not going to lie I'm pretty basic like when my plants start to get sick.
[02:52:01.740 --> 02:52:04.740]  You know or I start to see nutrient deficiencies one way or the other.
[02:52:05.740 --> 02:52:07.740]  Then I'll start searching into the soil.
[02:52:08.740 --> 02:52:15.740]  I don't do a lot of sap analysis even though I should because that's kind of you know like that tells you exactly what's going on.
[02:52:16.300 --> 02:52:25.300]  You know at least with the metabolism in the plant and like how much like how much it's uptaking and what it's doing with what it's uptaking.
[02:52:26.300 --> 02:52:33.300]  And I don't do a lot of sap analysis to be honest with you and that's something that I've I should do more of.
[02:52:34.300 --> 02:52:37.300]  Because it is pretty indicative of what's going on with the plant.
[02:52:38.300 --> 02:52:42.300]  As far as you know I just I'm a pretty intuitive grower.
[02:52:42.860 --> 02:52:52.860]  I don't know if that's like the way to say it but you know I look at my plants and you know versus other than you know soil tests are super valuable.
[02:52:53.860 --> 02:53:01.860]  You know both you know to tell me what's in the soil but also you know paste saturated paste tests to tell me what's available.
[02:53:02.860 --> 02:53:05.860]  Not just what's in the massive soil but what's available for the plant to uptake.
[02:53:06.420 --> 02:53:18.420]  Other than that you know like I don't have a PAR meter you know but I you know lighting and you know those sort of you know technology is my friend.
[02:53:19.420 --> 02:53:25.420]  You know I should use it more but I'm pretty low tech when it comes to most of my systems.
[02:53:26.420 --> 02:53:35.420]  Now obviously if I'm you know in a big garden like yeah we're gonna know exactly what's going on with all of the with humidity with airflow with CO2 with acid.
[02:53:36.420 --> 02:53:47.420]  You know photons with you know day length of breeze in the sun you know and then obviously soil analysis and in a perfect world you know sap analysis regularly.
[02:53:48.420 --> 02:53:58.420]  You know I think you could you know really get away with if you did that weekly and adjusted accordingly I think you could really you know you mentioned bricks earlier.
[02:53:58.980 --> 02:54:11.980]  You know that's really what you're looking at you know you can you can kind of dial your system and even more you know but me personally you know soil soil tests and that's it.
[02:54:13.980 --> 02:54:20.980]  And and we're on the home stretch because I can see Nick yawning.
[02:54:21.980 --> 02:54:23.980]  Way past my bedtime.
[02:54:24.540 --> 02:54:34.540]  Strong style organics said ask him if he top dresses indoor plants with fan leaves to close nutrient loop. Why or why not?
[02:54:35.540 --> 02:54:44.540]  Yeah I do if they're if the plant's healthy you know I would never like if you know I'm seeing any sort of pest pressure or anything on my plants.
[02:54:45.100 --> 02:54:57.100]  I would remove those leaves from the system and not kind of perpetuate the same problem, but absolutely like any biomass that's produced, whether it be with my cover crop or my
[02:54:57.660 --> 02:55:05.660]  My canvas plant everything gets recycled back to the soil, you know down to at the end after I harvest and I you know remove.
[02:55:06.660 --> 02:55:15.660]  All the buds and like the trim goes to extraction the bud goes where it goes, and then I have leftover stems that gets mulched and returned back to the system as well.
[02:55:16.220 --> 02:55:28.220]  So everything the roots stay right where they where they're at, you know it's all it's all organic matter that will get turned back into food, you know, like the same pot is producing nutrition.
[02:55:29.220 --> 02:55:36.220]  You know it's to make that plant grow if I put that plant back into the soil and it's you know it definitely closes that loop so.
[02:55:36.780 --> 02:55:48.780]  That's something I preach to everyone like you're you've got to recycle as much of that material as possible because that's I mean that's free free nutrients right there and you.
[02:55:49.780 --> 02:55:50.780]  You know exactly where it came from.
[02:55:51.780 --> 02:55:59.780]  You know exactly where it came from, you know, even if you can even if you take it out of the system and you compost it and then you re add your compost back system, you know, like that is.
[02:56:00.340 --> 02:56:16.340]  You know that's paramount as well, you know, but I am a proponent of literally every when I defan or I you know take clones and I you know cut the clones down and all that stuff all that gets returned to to the living soil pot or dead or the base of the plant.
[02:56:17.340 --> 02:56:18.340]  In the case of outdoors.
[02:56:19.340 --> 02:56:20.340]  Right yeah.
[02:56:20.340 --> 02:56:21.340]  Absolutely.
[02:56:21.900 --> 02:56:22.900]  All right.
[02:56:22.900 --> 02:56:33.900]  So this is my most my most important question the night for each of you if we break right now how quick till you're actually in bed because for me I'm in the basement.
[02:56:33.900 --> 02:56:35.900]  So I just got to walk out to fly.
[02:56:36.900 --> 02:56:39.900]  I also just have to go upstairs.
[02:56:40.460 --> 02:56:41.460]  Yeah.
[02:56:42.460 --> 02:56:43.460]  No, I don't know.
[02:56:44.460 --> 02:56:49.460]  I keep I keep seeing something that I asked about Instagram handles genome alchemy over here.
[02:56:50.460 --> 02:56:53.460]  G E N E underscore.
[02:56:54.460 --> 02:56:55.460]  Oh, underscore alchemy.
[02:56:56.460 --> 02:56:58.460]  So yeah genome alchemy over here.
[02:56:59.460 --> 02:57:05.460]  Definitely pre the man follow shares page that people know where you got this education tonight.
[02:57:06.460 --> 02:57:07.460]  Absolutely.
[02:57:07.460 --> 02:57:08.460]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:57:09.020 --> 02:57:10.020]  Well deserved man.
[02:57:11.020 --> 02:57:12.020]  You know, so yeah.
[02:57:13.020 --> 02:57:16.020]  So so Brian, you have any more you ready to go to bed.
[02:57:16.020 --> 02:57:18.020]  You ready to walk upstairs to bed.
[02:57:19.020 --> 02:57:20.020]  I feel good, man.
[02:57:21.020 --> 02:57:22.020]  I kind of nerd out on this stuff to be honest.
[02:57:23.020 --> 02:57:24.020]  Yeah, I could.
[02:57:25.020 --> 02:57:26.020]  I'm fine.
[02:57:27.020 --> 02:57:30.020]  I'm like I could fall asleep or you guys can keep talking and.
[02:57:31.020 --> 02:57:32.020]  No, no.
[02:57:33.020 --> 02:57:34.020]  I think he wants to go.
[02:57:35.020 --> 02:57:36.020]  But.
[02:57:36.580 --> 02:57:37.580]  I think we're watching.
[02:57:37.580 --> 02:57:38.580]  It's actually pretty cool.
[02:57:39.580 --> 02:57:40.580]  Got more time in your day.
[02:57:41.580 --> 02:57:42.580]  I don't sleep, bro.
[02:57:43.580 --> 02:57:44.580]  I don't saw.
[02:57:45.580 --> 02:57:49.580]  But, you know, I you know, obviously it's it's about, you know, like other people.
[02:57:50.580 --> 02:57:51.580]  Other other questions.
[02:57:51.580 --> 02:57:52.580]  Is that why you're asking that?
[02:57:53.580 --> 02:57:57.580]  I'm sure if we waited like 10 seconds, there'd be more questions.
[02:57:58.580 --> 02:58:03.580]  But we could, you know, we could do more of these to like this, you know, keep people
[02:58:04.140 --> 02:58:05.140]  want more.
[02:58:05.140 --> 02:58:08.140]  And this was something when I first started to cultivate that I really wish I would have
[02:58:09.140 --> 02:58:10.140]  had.
[02:58:10.140 --> 02:58:12.140]  I mean, we couldn't really get confidence go on.
[02:58:13.140 --> 02:58:16.140]  Anything but overgrowth was really where I felt like that.
[02:58:17.140 --> 02:58:22.140]  You know, I was also I felt like I got a lot of bad advice when I was first starting out,
[02:58:22.140 --> 02:58:24.140]  just kind of honestly fucking up and fucking up.
[02:58:25.140 --> 02:58:29.140]  So this is why I like this kind of forum is because hopefully we can minimize that community.
[02:58:29.700 --> 02:58:33.700]  More people understand that at least they they view it as a medicine.
[02:58:34.700 --> 02:58:38.700]  I think they'll also understand why, you know, minor cannabinoids are, in my opinion, almost
[02:58:39.700 --> 02:58:41.700]  more important than just focusing on THC.
[02:58:43.700 --> 02:58:44.700]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:58:45.700 --> 02:58:46.700]  I mean, it's also high.
[02:58:47.700 --> 02:58:48.700]  So I don't know.
[02:58:49.700 --> 02:58:50.700]  I see a question.
[02:58:50.700 --> 02:58:51.700]  I say question.
[02:58:51.700 --> 02:58:52.700]  What temp is the hash room?
[02:58:52.700 --> 02:58:53.700]  I like that question because.
[02:58:54.260 --> 02:58:59.260]  If you're going to make hash, period, you need to have temps below 64 degrees Fahrenheit.
[02:59:00.260 --> 02:59:05.260]  You know, the second you hit 65, you're going to have issues pulling, you're going to have
[02:59:06.260 --> 02:59:10.260]  issues with hash sticking to the bags, stability issues.
[02:59:12.260 --> 02:59:17.260]  You know, we really recommend these cold rooms, you know, and stick into like 40 degrees,
[02:59:17.260 --> 02:59:18.260]  40 to 44.
[02:59:19.260 --> 02:59:20.260]  It's way that cold.
[02:59:20.820 --> 02:59:24.820]  But I'm just saying, like, you can't if you're doing this at your house, you can't you can't
[02:59:25.820 --> 02:59:27.820]  do this in anything over 64 degrees.
[02:59:28.820 --> 02:59:29.820]  You'll be fucked.
[02:59:29.820 --> 02:59:30.820]  It won't it won't work.
[02:59:31.820 --> 02:59:32.820]  Yeah.
[02:59:32.820 --> 02:59:34.820]  No, our cold rooms, definitely, you know, 40 to 44.
[02:59:35.820 --> 02:59:36.820]  Wash it night, wash in the winter.
[02:59:39.820 --> 02:59:40.820]  That's colder than I actually thought.
[02:59:41.820 --> 02:59:42.820]  That was pretty high.
[02:59:43.820 --> 02:59:44.820]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:59:44.820 --> 02:59:47.820]  There's walk-ins, you know, some of us have designed other cold rooms, you know, walk-ins.
[02:59:48.380 --> 02:59:52.380]  Like, it's really, you know, hard to make them warmer than that.
[02:59:53.380 --> 02:59:54.380]  Yeah.
[02:59:55.380 --> 02:59:56.380]  It's got to be efficient, too, right?
[02:59:57.380 --> 02:59:58.380]  You're paying for ice.
[02:59:59.380 --> 03:00:02.380]  Trying to keep that water cold, you know, like air temperature is a thing, you know.
[03:00:03.380 --> 03:00:04.380]  You can't insulate, you can only insulate.
[03:00:05.380 --> 03:00:07.380]  All the boys are always wearing their big jackets and stuff.
[03:00:08.380 --> 03:00:11.380]  I've been working at this lab in Berkeley, and it's so cold, cold.
[03:00:12.380 --> 03:00:13.380]  It's down to 40, you know.
[03:00:13.940 --> 03:00:16.940]  Mixing, hand mixing everything at the Berkeley lab, for sure.
[03:00:17.940 --> 03:00:18.940]  So it's a vibe, though.
[03:00:19.940 --> 03:00:23.940]  You know, if you if you're in that lab, you're there because you're passionate about this.
[03:00:24.940 --> 03:00:31.940]  And that's what that's really why, you know, I think promoting the cold room is the coolest thing, you know, because you're not going to get tax makers just in there for the fuck of it.
[03:00:32.940 --> 03:00:34.940]  You're going to get the people in there that are passionate about it.
[03:00:35.940 --> 03:00:40.940]  Don't talk about 40 degrees for six hours, you know, like, yeah, passion's going to shine through.
[03:00:41.500 --> 03:01:01.500]  So, Nick, a while ago, Tony, Tony, Tony, Tony asked, notice any difference using the same water from first wash through the fifth instead of using fresh new water each run?
[03:01:02.500 --> 03:01:03.500]  It's a great question.
[03:01:04.060 --> 03:01:21.060]  You know, after I really learned the rinsing tech, you know, especially if you have issues cooling your water and not wanting to just continuously use up all your clean RO water each and every time.
[03:01:22.060 --> 03:01:28.060]  The rinsing tech has been, you know, allowed me to continue to use the same water through that first run, the second run.
[03:01:29.060 --> 03:01:31.060]  And I haven't really seen too much difference.
[03:01:31.620 --> 03:01:34.620]  And that's how that's how we operate at Essential.
[03:01:34.620 --> 03:01:39.620]  I know a lot of people that use brand new water for each individual run.
[03:01:40.620 --> 03:01:46.620]  But, yeah, if I notice like a bunch of chlorophyll or something in it, you know, I won't reuse it.
[03:01:47.620 --> 03:01:48.620]  I'll definitely use new water.
[03:01:50.620 --> 03:01:54.620]  But we try not to run those those those strengths that just leach.
[03:01:55.620 --> 03:01:56.620]  Right. Green water.
[03:01:57.620 --> 03:01:58.620]  Yeah. Don't wash it.
[03:01:59.180 --> 03:02:00.180]  I mean, I want to do water.
[03:02:01.180 --> 03:02:02.180]  Something. But you know what?
[03:02:02.180 --> 03:02:04.180]  Things like that have surprised me, too.
[03:02:04.180 --> 03:02:06.180]  Like this Frittles that we just washed in Berkeley.
[03:02:06.180 --> 03:02:08.180]  It was straight purple water.
[03:02:08.180 --> 03:02:12.180]  Generally, purple strains don't yield for us as a thicker, waxy cuticle.
[03:02:13.180 --> 03:02:14.180]  And generally, Skittles doesn't yield.
[03:02:14.180 --> 03:02:16.180]  Generally, forbidden fruit doesn't yield.
[03:02:17.180 --> 03:02:18.180]  Somehow, those two combine.
[03:02:19.180 --> 03:02:21.180]  Big Up B365 Cannabis.
[03:02:23.180 --> 03:02:26.180]  We found and Big Up Calicocher, of course, for cultivating it.
[03:02:26.740 --> 03:02:30.740]  We found a yielder that pre-rosin, I think we're at 4.85 percent.
[03:02:31.740 --> 03:02:32.740]  Something like that.
[03:02:33.740 --> 03:02:34.740]  So it was definitely viable.
[03:02:35.740 --> 03:02:36.740]  And that's fresh frozen weight.
[03:02:37.740 --> 03:02:40.740]  So once you convert that to dry, you multiply that by like four or five.
[03:02:41.740 --> 03:02:42.740]  So we're talking 20, 25 percent.
[03:02:43.740 --> 03:02:48.740]  So from 619 to 664 asks, what about a Temple Ball style of hash?
[03:02:49.740 --> 03:02:51.740]  Does a room temperature matter as much?
[03:02:52.300 --> 03:02:55.300]  If you're trying to make quality hash room temperature.
[03:02:56.300 --> 03:02:57.300]  Yeah.
[03:02:57.300 --> 03:03:01.300]  If you're trying to make quality hash, temperature and humidity control matters 100 percent.
[03:03:02.300 --> 03:03:05.300]  If you're using quality material, it matters.
[03:03:06.300 --> 03:03:10.300]  So, yeah, even if your end product is going to be a Temple Ball,
[03:03:12.300 --> 03:03:16.300]  if it's a Temple Ball of Gorilla Glue number four and you're working in 80 degree temperature,
[03:03:17.300 --> 03:03:21.300]  you're not going to get it off your back to even get to the point of Temple Ball.
[03:03:22.300 --> 03:03:23.300]  So, yeah.
[03:03:25.300 --> 03:03:28.300]  I mean, if you're using really, really low quality material,
[03:03:29.300 --> 03:03:31.300]  your temps could raise a little bit higher.
[03:03:32.300 --> 03:03:35.300]  I mean, it just really depends on what your end goal is.
[03:03:38.300 --> 03:03:41.300]  You might have more issues, more microbial at that point, too.
[03:03:43.300 --> 03:03:44.300]  Yeah.
[03:03:44.300 --> 03:03:45.300]  I didn't think about that.
[03:03:46.300 --> 03:03:49.300]  You know, like having the temperature and humidity go up in your lab.
[03:03:49.860 --> 03:03:51.860]  Yeah, you're going to have some issues.
[03:03:53.860 --> 03:03:58.860]  If you have moisture and you have plant material, mobile can be a good addition.
[03:04:03.860 --> 03:04:04.860]  All right.
[03:04:04.860 --> 03:04:06.860]  So, raise your hand if you are ready to go to bed.
[03:04:14.860 --> 03:04:16.860]  Can we get a cameo from the guys off camera?
[03:04:17.420 --> 03:04:18.420]  Dabs up.
[03:04:20.420 --> 03:04:21.420]  There you go.
[03:04:21.420 --> 03:04:22.420]  That's great.
[03:04:24.420 --> 03:04:25.420]  And who's that?
[03:04:26.420 --> 03:04:28.420]  DeGear Forge, owner of Melvora.
[03:04:29.420 --> 03:04:30.420]  Ah, nice to meet you.
[03:04:31.420 --> 03:04:35.420]  So, is this your, are we in your home right now, your shop?
[03:04:36.420 --> 03:04:38.420]  And it looks like someone just came out of the cold room.
[03:04:40.420 --> 03:04:42.420]  The guy who's ready to go to bed.
[03:04:43.420 --> 03:04:44.420]  Yeah.
[03:04:44.420 --> 03:04:45.420]  So, you guys are both raising your hands.
[03:04:45.980 --> 03:04:46.980]  I've been up since 5am.
[03:04:47.980 --> 03:04:48.980]  I flew in this morning.
[03:04:49.980 --> 03:04:50.980]  Oh, as have I.
[03:04:52.980 --> 03:05:03.980]  I try to get all my work done before my two daughters wake up and put a squash on my ability to get shit done.
[03:05:04.980 --> 03:05:08.980]  So, have you guys just been like longingly eyeing those rigs?
[03:05:09.980 --> 03:05:10.980]  Yeah.
[03:05:10.980 --> 03:05:11.980]  So, but who made those?
[03:05:12.980 --> 03:05:14.980]  Like, who's the, who's the owner of those rigs?
[03:05:15.980 --> 03:05:18.980]  It's, his name is Swayze Glass.
[03:05:19.980 --> 03:05:20.980]  He's from Fort Collins.
[03:05:21.980 --> 03:05:22.980]  Okay, so Colorado.
[03:05:23.980 --> 03:05:24.980]  Yeah.
[03:05:24.980 --> 03:05:28.980]  Alex, I forget his last name, but Swayze Glass.
[03:05:29.980 --> 03:05:30.980]  And you want to give him a shout out?
[03:05:31.980 --> 03:05:35.980]  Like, what do you like about his glass, his glass-blown shops?
[03:05:36.540 --> 03:05:49.540]  You know, he's, he was very affordable and easy to work with as far as design and the implementation of what I wanted at the time in my pipe.
[03:05:51.540 --> 03:05:52.540]  All right.
[03:05:52.540 --> 03:05:55.540]  So, you gave him guidance, like this is what I, so what were you looking for?
[03:05:56.540 --> 03:05:58.540]  Like the size of the barrel, how it.
[03:05:59.540 --> 03:06:01.540]  Can you, yeah, I was going to say, can you Vanna White that?
[03:06:02.100 --> 03:06:10.100]  What mine do is they have a bigger base and they actually drop set into the top of the bar so they don't move.
[03:06:11.100 --> 03:06:12.100]  So they just stay there.
[03:06:13.100 --> 03:06:16.100]  So that was a design feature for safety and future.
[03:06:17.100 --> 03:06:19.100]  For all the idiots that you have to deal with.
[03:06:20.100 --> 03:06:21.100]  You need to dummy prove it.
[03:06:22.100 --> 03:06:23.100]  I'm going to hand those to one of them.
[03:06:24.100 --> 03:06:25.100]  Yeah, I mean, it's.
[03:06:25.660 --> 03:06:33.660]  Can we do like an infomercial where one of the other guys comes and pretends to be the idiot who like accidentally knocks shit over?
[03:06:34.660 --> 03:06:35.660]  Oh, it just happened.
[03:06:36.660 --> 03:06:37.660]  Oh, fuck.
[03:06:37.660 --> 03:06:38.660]  Did that really just happen?
[03:06:39.660 --> 03:06:43.660]  Well, earlier today, they just tip over, you know, if you pick them up, wrong person, wrong time.
[03:06:44.660 --> 03:06:54.660]  But so it's bottom heavy so that it doesn't easily get knocked over because you have lots of people like dabbing for the first time.
[03:06:55.660 --> 03:06:58.660]  And everyone picks it up or tries to.
[03:06:59.660 --> 03:07:00.660]  Right.
[03:07:00.660 --> 03:07:02.660]  And it's glass, so it'll break no matter what.
[03:07:03.660 --> 03:07:04.660]  It's going to break.
[03:07:05.660 --> 03:07:09.660]  So you were explaining to the glass blower, like, all right, here are the people I have to deal with.
[03:07:10.660 --> 03:07:11.660]  Here's what we need to make.
[03:07:12.660 --> 03:07:13.660]  Can you do it?
[03:07:13.660 --> 03:07:14.660]  And he was like, sure.
[03:07:15.660 --> 03:07:16.660]  Imagine a circus.
[03:07:17.660 --> 03:07:18.660]  An intoxicated circus.
[03:07:19.660 --> 03:07:20.660]  And that's what cannabis events are.
[03:07:21.220 --> 03:07:22.220]  You know.
[03:07:24.220 --> 03:07:25.220]  And wait, wait.
[03:07:25.220 --> 03:07:26.220]  All right.
[03:07:26.220 --> 03:07:30.220]  So, by the way, did the rest of the crew just like they just all go home?
[03:07:31.220 --> 03:07:32.220]  No, they're in the back.
[03:07:34.220 --> 03:07:35.220]  Oh, there they are coming back.
[03:07:36.220 --> 03:07:37.220]  All right.
[03:07:37.220 --> 03:07:42.220]  So, yeah, I think I think last I checked, we had like 300 something people watching.
[03:07:43.220 --> 03:07:48.220]  So I want to say thank you, everybody who's watching.
[03:07:48.780 --> 03:07:57.780]  I want to say thank you, everybody who's still because I always love it's like, I mean, you guys aren't, but I'm on West Coast time and it's 1115 at night.
[03:07:58.780 --> 03:08:00.780]  So, yeah, we're an hour ahead.
[03:08:01.780 --> 03:08:02.780]  You guys are after midnight.
[03:08:03.780 --> 03:08:06.780]  But I knew that.
[03:08:10.780 --> 03:08:11.780]  What's that?
[03:08:12.780 --> 03:08:13.780]  Oh, China glass.
[03:08:13.780 --> 03:08:14.780]  But I know that would offend.
[03:08:15.780 --> 03:08:16.780]  Yeah.
[03:08:17.340 --> 03:08:19.340]  Oh, they're talking shit because it broke.
[03:08:21.340 --> 03:08:22.340]  We just go.
[03:08:27.340 --> 03:08:28.340]  Yeah, people are.
[03:08:30.340 --> 03:08:31.340]  Yeah, they are.
[03:08:31.340 --> 03:08:32.340]  Never.
[03:08:32.340 --> 03:08:33.340]  Oh, this is made in America.
[03:08:35.340 --> 03:08:36.340]  All of it.
[03:08:37.340 --> 03:08:42.340]  So just quickly, when I wake up tomorrow, we have.
[03:08:42.900 --> 03:08:45.900]  TGA, the whole crew.
[03:08:46.900 --> 03:08:49.900]  So we're going to hear some interesting stories.
[03:08:56.560 --> 03:08:58.560]  Those guys, that crew definitely.
[03:08:59.560 --> 03:09:00.560]  Yeah, they got some.
[03:09:01.560 --> 03:09:02.560]  They got genetics out there.
[03:09:03.560 --> 03:09:08.560]  So there are props that left dudes around for a long, long time.
[03:09:09.120 --> 03:09:12.120]  Yeah, so with that, should we should we call it a night?
[03:09:13.120 --> 03:09:14.120]  It's college.
[03:09:14.120 --> 03:09:15.120]  Yeah.

[03:09:21.120 --> 03:09:22.120]  Genome Alchemy.
[03:09:22.120 --> 03:09:23.120]  Yeah.
[03:09:23.120 --> 03:09:24.120]  Gene underscore.
