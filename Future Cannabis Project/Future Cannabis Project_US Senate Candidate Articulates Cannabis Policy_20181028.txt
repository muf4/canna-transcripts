[00:10.360 --> 00:19.360]  We're going to invite Kevin DeLeon up to join us and support his campaign.
[00:19.360 --> 00:22.360]  Alright, give it up for Kevin DeLeon you guys.
[00:22.360 --> 00:27.360]  Kevin's going to tell us that he's smoked a lot of weed for his entire life.
[00:27.360 --> 00:30.360]  And he wants your vote.
[00:30.360 --> 00:34.360]  Well, very quickly, let me introduce myself to each and every one of you.
[00:34.360 --> 00:39.360]  For those who don't know me, I thank you very much for allowing me to share a few words with all of you here today.
[00:39.360 --> 00:42.360]  An incredible night here in Venice, California.
[00:42.360 --> 00:50.360]  My name is Kevin DeLeon, and I'm running to become your next U.S. Senator for the great state of California.
[00:50.360 --> 00:55.360]  And I believe strongly that these are very dangerous, consequential times in our nation's history.
[00:55.360 --> 01:03.360]  That we're in fact engaged in a battle for the soul, for this nation, against a president without one.
[01:03.360 --> 01:11.360]  Now, the issue of cannabis and why this is so important, and why we should have a voice in Washington, D.C.
[01:11.360 --> 01:19.360]  is because the current incumbent that I'm running against doesn't even support the use of cannabis for medicinal uses.
[01:19.360 --> 01:21.360]  Now, think about this.
[01:21.360 --> 01:26.360]  Wherever your perspective may be on the issue of cannabis, and I know where all of your perspectives are on cannabis,
[01:26.360 --> 01:29.360]  but society as a whole.
[01:29.360 --> 01:38.360]  Now, if you don't support at minimum the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes,
[01:38.360 --> 01:43.360]  when we have scientific empirical evidence with regards to people who have AIDS,
[01:43.360 --> 01:50.360]  people who have Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, some form of cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, whatever type of cancer,
[01:50.360 --> 01:55.360]  whatever variation, to help alleviate pain, suffering.
[01:55.360 --> 02:05.360]  If you don't support that with scientific evidence, then I don't believe you should be a voice of a state like California
[02:05.360 --> 02:09.360]  that is diverse like no other state in the entire world.
[02:09.360 --> 02:19.720]  So I am a supporter of the medicinal use of cannabis, as well as the recreational use of cannabis.
[02:19.720 --> 02:28.720]  And we have an incredible opportunity to make sure that cannabis industry becomes a strong green pillar of our economy.
[02:28.720 --> 02:31.720]  Today we're the fifth largest economy in the world.
[02:31.720 --> 02:34.720]  And to put this in context, there are only four economies larger than that of ours.
[02:34.720 --> 02:42.720]  United States of America as a whole, China, Japan, Germany, then your great state, our great state, the state of California.
[02:42.720 --> 02:48.720]  And if you're remotely interested in rounding up the top ten, that number six is the United Kingdom, seven it is France,
[02:48.720 --> 02:54.720]  then we have Italy, India, and that number ten, it is Vladimir Putin's Russia.
[02:54.720 --> 03:00.720]  So to put this in context, California's GDP is larger than that of Vladimir Putin's Russia.
[03:00.720 --> 03:03.720]  And I am a strong proponent of clean energy.
[03:03.720 --> 03:09.720]  I am the author of the most far-reaching climate change policy in the United States of America, 100% clean energy.
[03:09.720 --> 03:17.720]  California is the largest economy in the world to legally mandate 100% clean energy by the year 2045.
[03:17.720 --> 03:26.720]  I'm a strong supporter of clean energy because we have an incredible opportunity to convert these environmental challenges into real economic opportunities,
[03:26.720 --> 03:34.720]  especially giving those at the lowest economic strata, those men and women of color, real opportunities to succeed in a clean energy space,
[03:34.720 --> 03:41.720]  energy efficiency, renewable energy, wind, solar, and other clean energy technologies that will be invented in the future,
[03:41.720 --> 03:44.720]  transportation, electrification, ZEVs, zero emissions vehicles.
[03:44.720 --> 03:51.720]  So a green economy is our future, but a green economy with cannabis is our future too.
[03:51.720 --> 03:57.720]  And these are two twin pillars that can really drive California's economy well into the future.
[03:57.720 --> 04:05.720]  That's why having a voice in Washington, D.C., and being a leader nationwide for cannabis is absolutely important.
[04:05.720 --> 04:12.720]  Now, when we passed medicinal use of cannabis, we thought that that would open up the doors,
[04:12.720 --> 04:20.720]  but it really didn't because of all the litigation, because of local governments, because of cultural prejudices with regards to cannabis.
[04:20.720 --> 04:29.720]  But that's why we have a Department of Justice that's hostile to the legal establishment of cannabis, not just in California, but throughout the country.
[04:29.720 --> 04:36.720]  And that's why we need a voice in Washington, D.C. that's going to deschedule, deschedule cannabis.
[04:37.720 --> 04:49.720]  Because to put cannabis on the same level of heroin and cocaine is ludicrous.
[04:49.720 --> 05:00.720]  And we have seen the consequences of so many men and women, but particularly men and men of color, that have been incarcerated because of this scheduling.
[05:00.720 --> 05:08.720]  And we've seen the devastation. We've seen our taxpayer dollars blow up budgets to incarcerate so many individuals.
[05:08.720 --> 05:17.720]  And that's why we need a strong voice in Washington, D.C. that will fight the Department of Justice, that will fight the prejudices that exist in the Congress today.
[05:17.720 --> 05:23.720]  We export 75 percent of cannabis to other parts of the country.
[05:23.720 --> 05:30.720]  So California will be and can be and should be and will be that economy for the entire nation.
[05:30.720 --> 05:36.720]  That's why I just want to thank you very much for giving me an opportunity to share a few words with all of you here today.
[05:36.720 --> 05:44.720]  I want to say that we have a real opportunity to grow this industry, but you need champions who are going to be there with you.
[05:44.720 --> 05:47.720]  So, Kevin, can I start a conversation here with you about this?
[05:47.720 --> 05:48.720]  Yes, absolutely.
[05:49.720 --> 05:52.720]  Thank you for being a champion for our cause.
[05:52.720 --> 05:56.720]  And you definitely have our votes. I voted for you.
[05:56.720 --> 05:59.720]  So excited that you're here right now.
[05:59.720 --> 06:06.720]  And we're in the midst of a tsunami of regulations that just changed on us at the moment.
[06:06.720 --> 06:12.720]  And we've been witnessing extinction events with our licensed operators since January 1st.
[06:12.720 --> 06:19.720]  We've been watching extinction events with legacy operators that were not able to get permits, still haven't been able to get permits.
[06:19.720 --> 06:29.720]  And now with the regulations continuing to cause whiplash, we're in an awkward state right now where we're not sure which way we're going.
[06:29.720 --> 06:33.720]  And even the smartest people in the industry can't figure it.
[06:33.720 --> 06:36.720]  We can't come to a consensus on what just changed.
[06:36.720 --> 06:40.720]  Therefore, we can't come to a consensus on what solutions we need to implement.
[06:40.720 --> 06:41.720]  What to do.
[06:41.720 --> 06:42.720]  Yeah, right.
[06:42.720 --> 06:55.720]  And so really where we're at is we're having a tremendously challenging time regulating an unregulated market and competing with an unregulated market.
[06:55.720 --> 07:04.720]  And what it seems like California did was they took models from other states and tried to copy-paste this section over here.
[07:04.720 --> 07:07.720]  And we'll do it like Colorado did it over there.
[07:07.720 --> 07:17.720]  But they did not take into account that we had a thriving black market that produced 12.5 million pounds of cannabis prior to legalization going into effect.
[07:17.720 --> 07:26.720]  And so, I mean, really like the number one issue that we're discovering right now that is blowing all of my smartest friends away is that we have an inversion problem.
[07:26.720 --> 07:29.720]  Everyone was so worried about a diversion problem.
[07:29.720 --> 07:36.720]  We have a significant inversion problem because there's so many legacy operators that can't get permits.
[07:36.720 --> 07:42.720]  And then, you know, we wanted to be able to talk to you about, you know, these challenges that we're facing at the moment.
[07:42.720 --> 07:51.720]  We have 11 days right now left of a 15-day public comment period where we can't get consensus with the smartest people on, you know.
[07:51.720 --> 07:53.720]  So, take over Pamela.
[07:53.720 --> 08:01.720]  The consensus is difficult because the issues affect operators at different pivot points, right?
[08:01.720 --> 08:02.720]  There's different pressure points.
[08:02.720 --> 08:14.720]  If you are a retailer and you have multiple operations or if you're vertically integrated or if you're a tech platform, what does a non-cannabis plant-touching business look like?
[08:14.720 --> 08:21.720]  I think that those are the real quintessential issues and what does it mean to be an owner?
[08:21.720 --> 08:25.720]  What does it mean to be a financial interest holder?
[08:25.720 --> 08:38.720]  And as we chart through these issues that we'll talk about, I think knowing as somebody who is hopefully going to be representing California's interest at the federal level,
[08:38.720 --> 08:43.720]  a lot of these issues splinter down into how do we get access to banking?
[08:43.720 --> 08:50.720]  How do we go about forging a path of uncertainty through these regulations?
[08:50.720 --> 09:00.720]  And I know that if 280E, for example, weren't an issue, some of these other licensing, white-labeling, structuring issues would also then evaporate.
[09:00.720 --> 09:06.720]  So, I think it's interesting for us to start that dialogue is what is the federal effect to the state?
[09:06.720 --> 09:07.720]  Go ahead.
[09:07.720 --> 09:08.720]  No, sir.
[09:08.720 --> 09:17.720]  Let me just add one thing because you said something that was really critical with the issue of banking and how many folks put their lives at risk, you know, with so much cash.
[09:18.720 --> 09:32.720]  And we have the banking system here that won't – it's prohibited legally, obviously, from accepting legally gotten gains by our retailers.
[09:32.720 --> 09:42.720]  Just this Monday, I did a press conference with the president of the city council of Los Angeles, Herb Wesson, with regards to the establishment of a public bank.
[09:43.720 --> 09:55.720]  And one of the reasons is because the federal regulations won't allow cannabis to be part of officially the banking system.
[09:55.720 --> 10:00.720]  That's why at the federal level, I want to be your voice to push this.
[10:00.720 --> 10:08.720]  And I think that there's a lot of cultural prejudices, obviously, that permeate Washington, D.C. on the issue of cannabis.
[10:09.720 --> 10:12.720]  We're so innovative. We're so creative. We're disruptive of a state.
[10:12.720 --> 10:16.720]  We just don't push the envelope. In fact, we tear the envelope apart.
[10:16.720 --> 10:20.720]  And that's why California is always so ahead of the curve in many ways.
[10:20.720 --> 10:25.720]  And that's why in Washington, D.C., it's always been archaic.
[10:25.720 --> 10:28.720]  It's just been behind the times.
[10:29.720 --> 10:37.720]  And that's why we have to have a voice in Washington, D.C., because what permeates Washington, D.C., are these cultural prejudices that –
[10:37.720 --> 10:40.720]  you remember the movie, the old movie, Reef or Madness?
[10:40.720 --> 10:46.720]  People truly think that in Washington, D.C., with regards to Reef or Madness.
[10:46.720 --> 10:49.720]  And that's so behind the times in comparison to what is happening.
[10:49.720 --> 10:50.720]  Bless you.
[10:50.720 --> 10:53.720]  But that's what makes California such an incredible place.
[10:53.720 --> 11:00.720]  And on the banking issue is what I want to work on as well, too, because that will help legitimize, if you will.
[11:00.720 --> 11:01.720]  Absolutely.
[11:01.720 --> 11:11.720]  And then cash flow, price points with regards to getting access to capital, which right now is very, very complex, if not almost impossible right now.
[11:11.720 --> 11:15.720]  So that's just a little with regards to the banking issue.
[11:18.720 --> 11:19.720]  Give us your full circle.
[11:19.720 --> 11:28.720]  So something that I love seeing in individuals' lives, because I'm all about self-enrichment, is seeing people that have a full circle moment.
[11:28.720 --> 11:32.720]  I've actually had a very much a full circle moment tonight.
[11:32.720 --> 11:34.720]  It was about two and a half, three years ago.
[11:34.720 --> 11:40.720]  I was in Washington, D.C., at our capital lobbying for cannabis rights.
[11:41.720 --> 11:59.720]  And I actually spoke with our California senator's office at the time that you were running against, and the chief of staff and the assistant chief of staff were very nonresponsive or combative with the group from Americans for Safe Access.
[11:59.720 --> 12:12.720]  And at the end of it, I told the chief of staff, I look forward to the day that I get to vote for the person that will be replacing you, because this is California, and we support cannabis here.
[12:12.720 --> 12:19.720]  And if our representatives don't stand behind what we believe in, then it is time for you to go.
[12:19.720 --> 12:23.720]  So I am personally very honored tonight to be sitting next to you.
[12:27.830 --> 12:29.830]  Does someone have a guitar for me right now?
[12:30.830 --> 12:31.830]  Because I will play.
[12:31.830 --> 12:33.830]  Someone please give me a guitar right now.
[12:33.830 --> 12:34.830]  You have a what?
[12:34.830 --> 12:35.830]  You have a guitar?
[12:35.830 --> 12:36.830]  Okay.
[12:37.830 --> 12:40.830]  No Joe Rogan moments right now.
[12:42.830 --> 12:43.830]  We saw what happened with Elon.
[12:43.830 --> 12:45.830]  That stock went down real fast.
[12:46.830 --> 12:48.830]  I thought it would go up, actually.
[12:49.830 --> 12:52.830]  But let me say this.
[12:52.830 --> 12:55.830]  Again, thank you very much from the bottom of my heart for giving me a few moments.
[12:55.830 --> 12:58.830]  And I'm sorry if I disrupted a little bit.
[12:58.830 --> 12:59.830]  Not at all.
[12:59.830 --> 13:04.830]  But my campaign is a disruptive campaign.
[13:04.830 --> 13:19.830]  And listen, I would never have been a state senator, nor would I have ever been the leader, the president of our California state senate, if I had listened to folks say, know when it is your time and know your place.
[13:19.830 --> 13:21.830]  In many ways, we're all disruptive.
[13:21.830 --> 13:25.830]  And that's who we are, because that's that creative spirit that's restless.
[13:26.830 --> 13:30.830]  And precisely what you said is that this is about values.
[13:30.830 --> 13:32.830]  And it's our values.
[13:32.830 --> 13:37.830]  And that's why it's time that we export California values to Washington, not the other way around.
[13:38.830 --> 13:41.830]  And we don't have to accept the status quo, the naysayers.
[13:41.830 --> 13:43.830]  It's always we can't do this.
[13:43.830 --> 13:44.830]  We can't do that.
[13:44.830 --> 13:52.830]  Well, we can't deal with the issue of banking because the law doesn't allow for banking for the cannabis industry.
[13:52.830 --> 13:53.830]  Well, why not?
[13:53.830 --> 13:54.830]  Let's change that.
[13:54.830 --> 13:56.830]  And let's disrupt the status quo.
[13:56.830 --> 13:57.830]  That's how you make laws.
[13:57.830 --> 14:00.830]  And that's how you make change in this country.
[14:00.830 --> 14:03.830]  And that's why we're the fifth largest economy in the world.
[14:03.830 --> 14:12.830]  And that's why we need to deal with the issue of this cannabis industry and make it a very legitimate industry like clean energy, like any other industry.
[14:12.830 --> 14:14.830]  You guys are on the cusp.
[14:14.830 --> 14:15.830]  You are on the vanguard.
[14:15.830 --> 14:20.830]  You are the progressive wing of this new industry that is a legitimate industry.
[14:21.830 --> 14:24.830]  And will be sooner or later recognized by the federal authorities.
[14:24.830 --> 14:28.830]  But in order for that to happen, you have to be involved in politics.
[14:28.830 --> 14:36.830]  Because if you're not involved in politics, politics is going to get involved with you whether you like it or not.
[14:36.830 --> 14:39.830]  And in this case, politics is getting involved with you.
[14:39.830 --> 14:41.830]  And you're not liking it.
[14:41.830 --> 14:42.830]  So what are you going to do?
[14:42.830 --> 14:45.830]  Are you going to cross your arms and say, well, that's the way it is?
[14:45.830 --> 14:47.830]  Well, no.
[14:47.830 --> 14:49.830]  You're going to fight for what you believe is right.
[14:49.830 --> 14:52.830]  That's who we are as Californians.
[14:52.830 --> 14:58.830]  And that's why I'm asking you come November 6, less than two weeks from now, don't forget to vote.
[14:58.830 --> 15:02.830]  Tell your friends, your neighbors, your loved ones, your co-workers, your workers.
[15:02.830 --> 15:09.830]  For the next two minutes, I want you to listen to the three other people on stage with you.
[15:10.830 --> 15:22.830]  And I want each of you to give Kevin one thing cannabis related that if he wins, you would like him to think about as he settles into Washington.
[15:22.830 --> 15:27.870]  If you choose banking, I'm choosing law enforcement.
[15:27.870 --> 15:28.870]  Which one are you going with?
[15:28.870 --> 15:30.870]  I only get one.
[15:30.870 --> 15:32.870]  You love a law enforcement moment.
[15:32.870 --> 15:33.870]  I already said banking.
[15:33.870 --> 15:35.870]  I want retraining for law enforcement.
[15:36.870 --> 15:42.870]  They don't know the difference between a licensed operator and an unlicensed one.
[15:42.870 --> 15:52.870]  And we're having a really hard time even calling them for support when a licensed operator is getting robbed for them to care.
[15:52.870 --> 15:54.870]  They don't care about our licensed weed.
[15:54.870 --> 15:55.870]  They're not going to go find it.
[15:55.870 --> 15:58.870]  And this is happening in a lot of jurisdictions at the moment.
[15:59.870 --> 16:04.870]  So that's sort of, you know, but if we had banking, that's my number one thing.
[16:04.870 --> 16:06.870]  But I'm pretty sure that Pamela was going to go with that one.
[16:06.870 --> 16:07.870]  We already did banking.
[16:07.870 --> 16:08.870]  Yeah.
[16:08.870 --> 16:09.870]  We did law enforcement.
[16:09.870 --> 16:11.870]  Banking, retraining for law enforcement.
[16:11.870 --> 16:12.870]  Go ahead.
[16:12.870 --> 16:25.870]  And to that note, though, as a person who fights for people dealing with disabilities as I was an individual on disability myself for several years while I went back to college due to my epilepsy,
[16:26.870 --> 16:29.870]  is police force, it's not just cannabis.
[16:29.870 --> 16:35.870]  It's every area that you're an outlier, that if you're outside of the norm, they need training.
[16:35.870 --> 16:37.870]  But I'm not going to take that one.
[16:37.870 --> 16:53.870]  What I'm going to take is maybe a little bit grander, is that I would love to see cannabis part of a universal health care system and not owned primarily or only by the pharmaceutical industry.
[16:54.870 --> 16:55.870]  I'd like to second that.
[16:55.870 --> 17:02.870]  I had debilitating migraines, so much so that they wanted to put me out on disability.
[17:02.870 --> 17:03.870]  And I'm an attorney.
[17:03.870 --> 17:07.870]  You don't hire an attorney who has a cognitive deficit for migraines.
[17:07.870 --> 17:14.870]  And I was able to get a standing prescription of 60 to 90 opiates in a month.
[17:14.870 --> 17:18.870]  And then I had to leave California to go to my family in Arizona.
[17:18.870 --> 17:20.870]  And luckily, cannabis was there for me.
[17:20.870 --> 17:22.870]  And it's why I have a career.
[17:22.870 --> 17:26.870]  I started advocating for the single most important person in your life is you.
[17:26.870 --> 17:28.870]  You are irreplaceable to yourself.
[17:28.870 --> 17:31.870]  And so I had to start advocating for myself.
[17:31.870 --> 17:37.870]  And through the advocacy of myself, I was advocating for those that were providing clean medicine.
[17:37.870 --> 17:50.870]  So to echo Brett's statement, we need to see reform for cannabis such that it's not $32,000 a year to be a patient to get Epidiolex.
[17:50.870 --> 17:52.870]  That's just—it's unfathomable.
[17:52.870 --> 17:58.870]  And you don't get insurance—you don't get medical reform without insurance reform.
[17:58.870 --> 17:59.870]  And we haven't seen that.
[17:59.870 --> 18:02.870]  And cannabis can be such a good conduit.
[18:02.870 --> 18:08.870]  I like to think of it as the mirror that we can look at how we deal with so many other issues
[18:08.870 --> 18:15.870]  and treat so many other drugs that could be, if used and dispelled with this nefarious brush,
[18:15.870 --> 18:23.870]  better than their opioid counterparts that are only there because the pharmaceutical companies are pushing them.
[18:23.870 --> 18:31.870]  Don't take away the small business that California is built on in cannabis and replace it with the pharmaceutical companies
[18:31.870 --> 18:38.870]  by blanketing reform that allows for them to reschedule instead of deschedule without a plan.
[18:38.870 --> 18:41.870]  So I think it's important to have both.
[18:41.870 --> 18:43.870]  It's a big difference.
[18:44.870 --> 18:45.870]  So thank you very much.
[18:45.870 --> 18:46.870]  This is wonderful input.
[18:46.870 --> 18:50.870]  I appreciate very much the input that I've received.
[18:50.870 --> 18:55.870]  It's important that all elected officials, all policymakers listen to all the perspectives.
[18:55.870 --> 19:03.870]  You know, I'd be remiss if I don't also introduce quickly a California state legislator as well,
[19:03.870 --> 19:09.870]  Assemblywoman Wendy Carrillo, who's always been a strong supporter of the cannabis industry.
[19:09.870 --> 19:12.870]  And, Wendy, can you show your face so folks can see you?
[19:12.870 --> 19:14.870]  That's Wendy Carrillo, everybody.
[19:14.870 --> 19:16.870]  Newly elected Assemblywoman.
[19:16.870 --> 19:22.870]  She's a strong, strong, fierce, independent woman, a strong supporter of the cannabis industry.
[19:22.870 --> 19:25.870]  She has an incredible future.
[19:25.870 --> 19:33.870]  She's in the beginning stages of being your Assemblywoman, representing parts of East LA and El Sereno, Echo Park and Silver Lake.
[19:33.870 --> 19:40.870]  And I look a lot to her for leadership, not just on this issue, but on many other issues.
[19:40.870 --> 19:43.870]  Again, that's Wendy Carrillo, who's there today with us.
[19:43.870 --> 19:47.870]  And thanks a lot for coming out to Venice today at the last second.
[19:47.870 --> 19:48.870]  And let's get out there.
[19:48.870 --> 19:49.870]  Let's win.
[19:49.870 --> 19:54.870]  Let's show the rest of the country and show the rest of the world how it's done in the great state of California.
[19:54.870 --> 19:55.870]  With that, thank you very much, everybody.
[19:55.870 --> 19:56.870]  Thank you.
[19:56.870 --> 19:57.870]  Thank you, Kevin.
[19:57.870 --> 19:58.870]  Thanks, Kevin.
