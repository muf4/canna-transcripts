Hello everybody, hope you're doing well. We have an awesome show ready to get started.
So without any further ado, we'll get everything beginning right, right, right, right.
Boom.
Set up, we should be ready to go.
Can everybody hear me?
Can you hear me?
And,
beep.
Yeah, response back, there you go, we're good.
If you hear this, I just need to turn the volume down a little bit.
Stop.
And without any further ado, with everybody here and ready to go and everything started, we'll do the intro.
But I'm excited for a fun day today because we have a very exciting expert we're going to jump into a very fun topic and dig into something that I think is super important is IPM but also doing it in the cleanest most natural way possible.
It's a highly diverse subject with a lot of facets and in and out and we have an awesome panelists joining us today, which we will let introduce themselves last we're gonna run through the rest of the panelists first, and then Claude will introduce himself.
But I'm very excited to bring you on board and have everybody coming in to join us for the conversation as well I see Corey coming into the panel, making a moderator to make everybody a moderator, make sure that if you're in the audience, or you're out in the world of future
cannabis project because we are live on future cannabis project as well that you share and like and get the community involved. So you can get as many people in here to enjoy this conversation as well.
I'm excited to get into it because there's some very, very fun parts to it.
But without any further ado, we'll let the moderators introduce themselves we're going to go Anita, Johnny, Ashley, Corey, Corey in that order, followed by Claude you'll introduce yourself last because you're a special guest for the day go ahead and get us rolling.
Hi everyone, I'm Anita, I am located in Ontario, Canada.
I have expertise is more in the sales and marketing side, but I do grow my own cannabis for medicinal purposes and I really enjoy the whole process of learning and growing, I'm really happy to be here.
I am really excited to talk to Claude and hear what you have to say about a lot of different cool things that he has coming.
Johnny, you're up next.
So we will not fault him. If he cannot speak at this exact point in time but we'll jump over to Ashley, Johnny when you just flash your mic or message me in the background when you get a moment, no worries to rush it.
Hey guys, super excited about tonight.
My name is Ashley Hubbard, I am the director of cultivation here in Michigan.
We are unique because we are fully aeroponic. And this is a topic I'm super excited to learn about.
I have an IPM specialist actually on staff, so always really cool to learn about everything that's going on at the smaller level.
And these beneficial bugs are just wicked cool so super excited about today.
Corey.
Hey everybody, good evening.
My name is Corey, I am currently working at one of the largest cannabis greenhouses in the world, in charge of the nursery right now so improving their processes over there, getting quicker rooting times all that fun stuff.
And we do have a couple of IPM people on our team at the greenhouse, and they are super enthusiastic because I'm super enthusiastic about this topic.
Love designing programs and getting them set up, you know, IPM programs are a huge cornerstone of any good, you know, solid nursery program that's about to put flower plants into flowering so very excited to go through this.
And hello to everybody on the future cannabis project and resonate radio that are watching on YouTube, I see you all. It's a pleasure much love everybody. Josh, you're up next brother.
Thanks Corey. Hey everyone, I'm Josh Burke, I'm a grower and breeder and hash maker and cannabis enthusiast overall.
I've worked in the industry and research and development and I've cultivated cannabis for probably about 15 years.
Over the last two years I've gone into living soil organics and I'm going to soon be switching into a, into an actual four by eight bed so I'm very excited to learn more about how I can optimize that environment today. Thanks guys.
Super exciting and a lot of fun I'm very excited to get things rolling I think Claude with two because he's been still a little bit early but we don't fault you for that.
I'm looking very much forward to the conversation before we get it rolling and kind of talk about what we're going to focus on as our subjects for the day.
But why don't you go ahead and introduce yourself.
Hi everybody.
Can everybody hear me correctly.
Yep. Yes. Okay, perfect. It's my first time. Yeah, I was kind of eager a bit. I started the show.
So, that's it. I'm in a cannabis enthusiast since 1986. I've been collecting genetics have been really really interested in all these things.
I've been working in greenhouse research since 2004.
I also was a counselor for small food producers, did a lot of research in that field and taught also food production at a college in the province of Quebec, and not far from Montreal.
I've also been involved with an assistant December 2018. At first I was just taking care of produce and things like that.
Then they, I went with the scientific director to visit one of the new cannabis customers, and he showed me a one plant and he said that.
And I looked at him and I said, is it kosher kush. And he said I've seen that face, their faces.
So, since then I've been taking care of the cannabis sector. So, I understood the much passion and knowledge I had for that plant.
So, we formed a team of three, now we're already three other people that work with me.
We just take care of cannabis crops across Canada, from the home growers, the ACMPRs, MMRs, to the micro producers, to the licensed producers, in whatever type of production they have indoor or outdoor, things like that.
Or aeroponics, hydroponics, living soil, whatever type of project they have.
We have tailor made solutions for them.
Anetsis started like in 2005. It was an idea of Dr. Sylvie Vautour-Derova, she's an amazing woman.
She arrived in Canada, she didn't speak much French and English, speaks six languages, she has two doctorates, two post doctorates.
She founded Anetsis, we started the first predatory mite farm in the south of Montreal.
At first it was just research and development, and then over the years it started to get commercial and things like that.
When I started Anetsis, we were 67 employees, now we're about more than 30, and we're expanding fast.
It's a really exciting world to be in, an IPM world.
So from there, I'll let London take it on.
Awesome, I'm super excited.
The general conversation for today, we've talked about this about me, Claude and Anita, and organized a little bit.
We're going to be doing this as a multi-part series, much like our breeder series.
We're going to try and focus on what's happening in spring, what can we do to ensure that we're going into our season with the best layers of pest prevention.
What are the things that we can keep an eye on, and what happens in that space.
I do invite people to come up during the conversation, ask a question, and see if we can answer it.
I love trying to stump people, so we'll see what we can do here.
I'm very excited to have you answer, because you have a wonderful way of explaining things that I look forward to.
I'm really excited to bring that up and forward to everybody.
If there are speakers, if you have a certain thing or statement to bring on, go ahead and do that at any point in time.
I really wanted to start the question with you, Claude.
What are we looking at at this point in time?
In the winter season in Canada, what is the first method of protection or things that we can do when we come out of the winter and into the spring?
To get a head start on things that come.
For me, my assumption, and tell me if I'm wrong, because I think it would be very informative for everybody around,
is that my assumption is that the first things you see in spring are things that crawl.
Aphids are usually the first thing I see.
I sometimes see spider mites a little bit earlier.
But you're active, crawling, moving things.
Not so much the root pests, because I find the soil doesn't heat up enough that there's a lot of fluidity and growth there.
I also don't see as many molds and problems like that in the springtime, although there is some.
But really, I'm not putting that many plants out to have to worry about that.
But really, the aphids and the crawling pests that come from.
I'd like to focus our conversation in there.
Let's start with that.
What do we need to worry about in the start of this season when we're looking at going into spring, if we're going to do outdoor?
First of all, when you're getting started, in fact, you have to know your growth.
What are you going to grow?
Is it going to be vegetables, medicinal herbs, cannabis?
Where are you going to grow it?
We've got auditors, I think, from all over North America and the world.
So we have to know what is your climate range, when you started the season.
When is the first date of the last date of you can expect some freezing temperatures at night, especially.
So you have to know also the history of your bugs, either that you had in the past or that could be present around your area or that could be attracted to your crop.
Cannabis is a crop that is loved by humans and so many other species.
So it is always attractive to many, many species.
You have to check if you're growing outdoors for sure.
You have to check your surrounding fields.
If you have some hay or some wheat or things like that, some grain, you might have some pressure when they harvest not far from your field.
You have different things like that you have to take into account.
Like I believe now it's not been confirmed, but the cannabis aphid might be endemic now in Ontario too.
So this is something that you have to take into account.
Also getting started.
It's like either if you start from seed, if it's like tomato plants or cannabis plants, or make sure that you have the, you tag everything well and you're going to have the right.
I've seen so many people make mistakes from the beginning and also accepting cuttings, exchanges.
Sometimes people just don't exchange only genetics.
They exchange also new pests.
That's how the cannabis aphid got dispersed across North America.
It was a big event in Oregon, I think, and hundreds of people left for all over North America with many cuttings that were all infested with cannabis aphid.
So it's always to start with clean cuttings.
Always start your check your starting material.
Like for example, spider mites usually are not a big issue outdoors.
If you start clean, if there's a really dry season, it also depends where you are in North America, but us up North, it is not a really big issue.
I know from my own experience in the past years ago that putting even infested plants outside, nature could take care of them.
But the thing is, is that if you start with cuttings that already have pests on them, it will be not a good start.
The thing is, so accept no cuttings.
If you accept cuttings, you have to put them in quarantine.
Quarantine is very, very important.
You know, you have to know your source, but even your source might not know that he has some aphids or some trips.
Some pests are really, really elusive or some rice with aphids or things like that.
That could be even worse.
In the spring when we start, like fungal diseases for sure, like potting molding is not really started and things like that.
But Pt would be something I would watch.
Like when you start your seedlings or you start the fresh cuttings, Pt likes to develop in cool temperature too.
Also, if you want to introduce bugs, you have a, let's say a cold frame greenhouse and you have a very cold nights like you go down to four degrees Celsius.
Sorry about I'm all stuck in Celsius.
I'd have to have somebody translate into Fahrenheit.
So four degrees Celsius, we have like a, there's a lot of people are using lacewings, but they're using green lacewings.
But there's another species.
We call it the brown lacewing.
It's Micromus variegatus.
This species is fantastic.
Even the adults will eat aphids.
And we started to use them, like the first customers were using them were produce customers, like organic farmers that were starting their greenhouses early.
And they can work from four degrees Celsius to 32 degrees Celsius, very well.
So you get to introduce them in your greenhouse at first and they can be a good ally present already in the greenhouse.
Right now, with the cold and everything, upper atmosphere, I mean, the northern hemisphere, we just do preparations.
Right now we're preparing what we're going to plant and what we're going to do.
The seeds are already been started or they're about to be started.
And that's it.
You have to be planning also for companion plants that will be in your garden, either in a greenhouse or outdoors.
For licensed producers, what the rules are in Canada.
I had the chance to work with different licensed producers, some that were wanting to achieve organic standards.
So they told me that we could use indicator plants like bean plants to know if we have spider mites in our greenhouse.
That we could use cover crop plants if we have a living soil.
That we could use also some banker plants.
We will talk a bit later on about that.
It just depends on the QA.
Their susceptibility to other plants being in the same facility as the risk.
Awesome. Now, before we get too deep into it, I did get a question.
Are you using a Bluetooth headset?
Yes, I should transfer maybe.
Do you want to try something different? It's coming through a little bit clicky on the far end.
That's no problem. We're here for it.
I will try to my desktop with the application I have.
See if that works.
Or just through my speakerphone maybe.
Yeah, I mean usually directly from the phone is best.
Just talk through your phone is usually the easiest way to go.
I did just mute you there for a moment, but I'm really excited to get into it.
I think we need to step it back a little bit and create a little bit more of a conversation point.
Where can we get a point of reference for people to really understand it?
As a point of reference, Corey, you're in an awesome space and doing something neat in Delta here.
We're coming into spring, so you have a great space. You have a great setup.
Do you want to maybe frame, give a general frame of what your setup and everything looks like for a cloud to go,
Hey, what would I do coming into this season?
Because often or not, depending on your space or facility, I don't bring in a lot of outside plants.
I think your words and choice for having a quarantine of your plants is super crucial and very important.
I, in general, try to avoid taking plants on unless they're from seed.
Just because life is fickled and things come in and out.
Even just transporting stuff from one space to another can create a lot of problems or issues.
There's a lot of things that can go on there. It's much easier to get from seed.
Or if I do get a cut, maybe I'll go take the cut there and bring a little bit of a wash at the time.
So I know that everything's as safe as possible.
I never try and take something with a medium or root ball or anything where there's things that are going to come out and hatch at a probability.
That's just my way of avoiding that situation.
Corey, I'll let you get rolling. Give Quaad a good frame to get into what we might make and take action if we have a functioning space already.
Maybe you've had a challenge recently that you'd be willing to share and we can dig into it.
I'm done speaking. Go ahead, Corey.
That's right. I need to unmute on both sides. That always helps too.
We can definitely do this a couple of different ways as well.
As far as large scale and small scale.
I want to point out for everybody, as far as conversation is concerned,
Thank you, Quaad, for pointing out the difference on the chrysopoem on the lacewing there.
That is absolutely imperative as well.
There's evolving pests, unfortunately, or evolving pest problems that we're running into, such as cannabis aphid, for example.
Isn't really a whole heck of a lot of fun.
But again, stepping it back a little bit, what is one of the real important things that people can do as far as cornerstones in an IPM program?
I've heard of various different things. If you have clones, you can do dips with certain different things.
One of the dips that we use is using opal soap.
We also have a dip that I've heard of using of cephalo-X.
Even some people going out there for regalia.
But yeah, I kind of wanted to know a little bit more in that sort of direction.
As far as when you really have those clones, when you get some of those roots,
what are some of the things that we can be doing in those really beginning stages that are going to go a long way?
Yes, really good point that you're bringing on.
I was about to get to there, but then I realized, oh, I'm taking all this space by myself and there's a panel.
So yes, for sure.
Like, let's say, for example, for licensed producers in Canada, there's about 46 products that are approved.
About 10 of them that you can do different oils, either vegetable oils like Vegal or some mineral based oil like pure spray.
That you can use opal that you pointed out too.
It's the same with copa. It's the same ingredients. They're all like exile.
They're all the same in Nudocan. They're all the same thing.
There's four products and they're all like 47 percent the salts, potassium, fatty acids.
So these work OK. For sure, at first to do a dip, I wouldn't, these products I wouldn't use late into the plant's life, especially not during flowering.
But when you have no choice, you have no choice.
But meaning they're really good to do that sort of cleanup of your plants to make sure during the quarantine that you have taken care of that.
What I really like is to use either a Bovaria Baciana strain.
Now I'm talking for my own parish, the Bioceres as a spray or the Botan Gard, our competitor.
But use the wettable powder and use them at the plumb stage or at the seedling stage.
I mean, the seedlings, I mean, the cutting stage seedlings.
You have to do that if you have other plants are infested everywhere.
But I mean, at the cutting stage, usually people would take cuttings on mutters and they don't know.
They don't even see the nymphs of aphids on them.
And then they'll realize that there's a full aphid infestation under their domes after four or five days when they recheck on their cuttings.
When you do a preventive spray every two or three days, since we know there's an industry of aphids under the domes, never use the liquid formula.
Don't never use the well-based, neither the Botan Gard ES or the Bioceres EC.
You will rot your clones if they haven't rooted under the dome.
So you use the wettable powder and it works like a wonderfully well.
In about a couple of days, you see the full floating bodies of Bovaryia.
Everything that you thought that would escape you is turned cut in white.
And so it is a good way to start clean without doing a dip, a complete dip.
You just do a spray.
Anyways, it's not on the label yet.
We're hoping to get it later on this year.
For now, spray works really, really well.
So sprays and dips are the way to go.
And I wanted to also point out as well, definitely learning issues in the beginning and proper training with some employee workers that I have as well.
But making sure that you protect the substrate as well when you're doing that dip and not getting into the root zone as best as possible.
For example, if you're doing that in a rock roll cube, it's going to cause your cube to go hydrophobic.
So that copa doesn't necessarily agree with that medium.
So just kind of a heads up, making sure when you're doing that dip, use techniques where you put the stem between your fingers, for example, with your palm covering those cubes.
So that you're not getting it into the root zone in those dipping solutions when you don't need to put it in the root zone.
Very, very important.
And just wanted to make sure that that was pointed out because again, recently ran into that, especially with the rock roll in copa and realized how incompatible it is for sure.
Yeah, not so much fun at all.
Can I just throw something out there? And I'm going to post it if that works for everybody.
But something to keep in mind about any IPM strategy is you want whatever your active ingredient is in whatever product you're using to have a different mode of action.
And what I mean by that is every single product, whether it's biological or chemical, it has a different mode of action for how it's actually affecting that pest.
So it's really important to change up different sprays that have different modes of action because that is how you build resistance.
You can't spray the same thing all at once, thinking that you're going to keep knocking that population down because insects can become resistant to it.
So I'm going to on the very top of this link up a really helpful guide that shows you exactly what the active ingredient is and how it works.
So just something to keep in mind in any proper IPM protocol or schedule, you want to make sure you're kind of switching up what you're using.
So with the clones, we utilize suffoil at a smaller dilution for the clone so it's not full force.
That goes ahead and makes sure that everything on our clones, if there's any pests, it actually suffocates them.
That's what the suffoil does.
And we use Bavaria as well as another treatment when they're early in their veg cycle.
So it's really just important for you guys to make sure you're looking at that active ingredient.
If you're ever curious what that is, any product that you purchase will have an SDS sheet.
You can kind of Google, hey, I just bought this.
What is my SDS sheet?
And it'll tell you what the active ingredients are.
And then you can kind of use this chart to just look at how it works.
So just something to keep in mind.
I just have a quick question for Claude to get back to what he was talking about with the spray solution.
Was that what we were talking about before where it's those spores that are in the liquid, the solution that penetrates the bodies of the pests and then basically makes them turn yellow?
Basically makes them turn into like popcorn balls?
I mean, metaphorically speaking.
You're on mute if you're trying to answer.
Yes, yes, I was muting and unmuting myself.
It's such a weird button on my phone.
I just thought it was such a fascinating thing like when we were discussing it earlier.
And I didn't want it to be missed because I didn't know if that was something that was common that people used.
Because I know that a lot of people use different types of bugs and things like that.
But using mushroom spores in terms of combating different bugs, I just thought that that was a really cool thing that I don't want to bypass or glaze over.
So anyways, I just wanted to ask a question if you could elaborate a little bit on that.
That would be great. Thank you.
Yes, for sure.
Bovaryal bastiana, there's many strains like ours, Design 03.
They have different virulence.
They're found naturally in nature.
So most products on the market are wettable powders or oil-based emulsifying concentrates.
So when you use a wettable powder, it has different advantages than the oil-based one.
The oil-based one will suffocate also spores or mites or other pests.
It also has that action, but it is not designed for that.
It's just like a pleasant side effect.
That's why we could get approval for spider mite control since August.
It's not the bovarya itself that will kill the mite.
So yes, the mushroom is very special.
In fact, it's a contact insecticide.
It has to touch the body of the insect, so it will germinate inside him.
It will go inside the immunolymph, which is like the blood stream of the insect.
It will develop a disease like white muscadine, and it will die of it.
Usually when the conditions are really right, relatively high, you will have the chance to see under the cutting domes.
It will turn into a white ball.
You will see the pruning body.
There might be some secondary infection to other insects from that, but usually it's not really the case.
So that's why we have to reapply it.
It's a product that's really gentle for the plant.
There's no phytotoxicity of it except for the oil that will do a phytotoxic action like in the root zone or on fragile cuttings that haven't rooted yet or things like that.
That could happen, but usually when the plants are really healthy or full grown and really rooted, there's no phytotoxicity like we would see happen with some soaps or other oils.
The thing is also, it's a really good thing that Ashley pointed out, the different oils in soap.
You have to check, you have to do the alternate.
It's very, very important.
They evolve so rapidly, if it's a pest like that, that they can develop resistance to different things by different ways.
If we don't alternate the products.
Just an example, I was talking to a customer this week and they thought they were smart too.
Oh, we have a nice rotational product.
They were using Exile, Copa, Opal and the solid one, Nutasam.
Oh, they're all different.
And the QA was okay with that.
But have you checked the ingredients?
They're all potassium salts or fatty acids.
That's 47%, even the same concentration.
So they thought they were putting, and legally, in fact, in a way, they would be okay in the book.
But it's like they will develop resistance.
It's no good.
The plants will suffocate too.
After a while, you have to watch with the soap and oils so your stomata don't clog themselves.
Because I've seen a lot of phytotoxicity that happens on the leaf edges.
Usually they turn brown, brittle.
Things like that can happen.
And the vitality of the plant too.
So sprays when you need them.
And also, like our friend Corey also was pointing out about the dips.
Usually the root zone will be dipped with Trichoderma or Gladioclansium, the press top, or another Trichoderma solution against Fusarium and Pithium.
And the leaf will be dipped with oil or something that is on the label.
But medical growers can use whatever organic product they want.
They're not narrowed to a limited list like the licensed producers in Canada.
So if somebody wants to continue.
I had a quick question.
While London looks like he's on mute.
I had a quick question.
You mentioned before, especially for outdoor grows.
When we're deciding what type of beneficial pest management we're going to bring in.
Looking at the outdoor area and surrounding crops would be important.
You mentioned that.
If you have a wheat crop.
Is it that there's more different types of bugs that would be there to cross over?
I mentioned that my backyard in particular, my experience was a huge giant field.
And they turned it into a subdivision.
And that summer they started to dig was the worst summer for bugs for me.
Everything just migrated next to into my yard.
And then I noticed last year wasn't so much.
And then the year after that it wasn't as much.
So I just thought it was interesting.
If you're always next door.
Is that something that you always have to consider?
Or does it change or whatnot?
I don't know.
Something that somebody also mentioned in the YouTube chat.
So if you wanted to talk about that.
Yes, for sure.
There'll be changing situation.
Like the situation I mentioned.
It happened at our outdoor grower in Ontario.
That city was surrounded by wheat fields.
So when the farmer harvested his field.
He could see the swarms of trips coming to his field.
It was a weird kind of cloud.
Like you could see through it.
And when it would reach you.
Like they would like slightly pinch burn you.
Like as they would like go through you.
So there was a lot of trips.
Because trips like they don't really fly the same way as other insects.
They mostly go on wind currents.
And magnetic fields.
And things like that.
So they caught the wind current.
And they left that field.
They were fleeing it.
So when you have.
Usually.
The minor parrot bug is a good predator to use outside.
So we saved that field.
By putting like about 2000 to 4000 individual per acre.
I think we released to help the native population.
So in fact what we did.
We boosted the natural population.
Of them.
Like things that we do inside.
In greenhouse or outdoors.
We cannot do outdoors.
Like such as there are no.
After experiences.
So we have to do that.
Even if my others.
In the industry sometimes.
We still recommending them.
I feel like after a good rain.
Gone.
There are no good.
So there's many.
Ways that we can prevent outdoors.
When we know that.
That's going to happen.
Especially if you had a mystery.
Of the pests that were around you.
So.
We'll go on like a bit later.
About the companion planting.
That you can attract.
Predators.
Into your garden.
Or.
Have plants that will like repel them to.
The bad bugs.
So.
That you don't want in your garden.
So.
I think you got it.
You got it on point.
I think we're coming about to the.
35 minute ish.
Point now.
We do have to have a hard stop.
But about.
Six 30 days.
So we do have an hour left.
So if you'd like to come up on stage.
And ask a question.
Or make a comment.
You can do that now.
If you'd like to come over from.
Future cannabis project.
And you're in the chat there.
We'll make sure to do it.
I did see.
When we will get to it.
Will cast 16.
So.
I'm going to put down your question.
And we will answer it.
A little bit here.
I want to dig into.
There's two more main things.
That we really want to get into before you get into that.
I just want to give everybody the opportunity to come up.
And during the conversation.
Ask a question.
Or see what's going on.
So.
But.
So you touched on companion.
And I think that's really smart.
What are some things that we can put in our gardens right now?
Potentially, you know, in the northern hemisphere.
We'll say in general.
We're looking at things like.
I.P.
A natural IPM like this.
Okay.
In fact, that's it.
Like I said.
If you want.
Insect repelling.
Like properties.
In your garden.
There's many choices.
Plan that you can use.
In fact.
Mint.
Is a one.
Lemon grass.
Time.
And.
And.
And.
And.
And.
And.
And.
And.
And.
And.
And.
And.
And.
And.
And.
And.
And.
And.
And some lovely plants like.
Lime.
Lavender.
Basil.
Or even some, like, pretty flowers.
Present among petunias.
Marigolds.
Or even aliams.
Like the aliums, like any, like member of the onion or chives.
French shallots or things like that.
They will usually.
like these plants, but meaning they're not invincible.
Now we have the swen midge in Quebec, Canada in general.
So these are best of garlic and leeks and onions in general.
And these we will introduce some predator.
Predator, we will use some trichogramma wasps
that will get the eggs of these swen midge.
So we will introduce cards in the field
or in your own garden that every week during that season,
that when they go and lay their eggs on your leeks
or onions or things like that,
there'll be some trichogramma, tiny trichogramma wasps
that will be coming out of cards from their pupa
that are glued on cardboard cards.
So you place them in your garden
and they'll be released every week to guard your gardens
against these swen midge that are like now a real pain.
And people are trying to grow garlic or onions or leeks,
especially leeks because the foliage has to be perfect
for market for people that want to sell them on the market.
Garlic is not that bad because once it's past the stage
of the flowering and everything, then you're okay.
I mean, it will withstand the swen midge.
So that's a way to, there's other ways like this.
So with the companion planting,
but with your companion planting,
you can bring in like other like pests,
but then you'll manage them with the,
like just said the trichogramma wasps.
If you want to like attract beneficials,
I would say there's many families of plant.
In fact, you can look into like the carrot family.
Like I would say, it's an, they have another name,
I'll simplify it.
Like the carrot family, like,
and they really much look like from afar,
like coriander, dill, caraway, fennel, parsnip,
even carrots, like if you use that flower.
I would say also from the astro family,
like they're more common and they're more known
than representatives are like sunflower,
like all the cone flowers, like echinacea,
tansy, yarrow.
Also you can use the mustard family.
Mustard family is really good too,
because in fact, you can also plow in
to your garden afterwards.
And there's a glucosinoids, I think they're called.
I would like to have Matthew Gates on board
to tell me the correct scientific name.
Anyways, it's a compound that's released from mustard,
all the plants in the mustard family.
Would it be radishes or yellow rocket or allicin
or different mustards, would it be cultivated or wild?
They release, they have properties, these compounds,
and that they will repel all the root nematodes,
all the, because usually we can use
like beneficial nematodes, and this I will touch in
in a couple minutes, about nematodes,
the beneficial ones.
But I mean, the root nematodes, they could combat that,
and all the soil, the pithium or fusarium
or verticillium or other soil diseases,
root diseases present in the soil, I mean,
could be combated that way.
So they'll be bringing in like predators,
but at the same time, they'll be playing the role
of keeping your soil clean of bad nematodes
and bad pathogen for your roots.
And I will just like, not in this segment,
but I mean, like, in fact, you could also use
like companion plants that also enrich your soil
in nitrogen, like all the, like the pea family,
in fact, all the legume and like the clove,
like whatever called earth cloves, alfalfa,
whatever beans, things like that,
they will be a good habitat,
and they'll bring an alternate prey too at the same time
as they feed nitrogen to your soil, to your plants.
So they're really good plants to have around,
and they could make, especially clover,
make a good cover crop.
Somebody else take this.
I love that.
I think that was awesome.
Do any of our panelists have like a situation
that they wanna dig into a little bit further
before we move on to trying to dispel an urban myth
or two here while we're on stage?
Nope, no.
Go ahead, Ashley.
Well, I will say that,
it's tough to try to standardize everything.
There's never gonna be an opportunity in your grow
or it's gonna be completely clean,
devoid of any potential paths or pests or pathogens.
So just starting with as clean of a clean of material,
clean of space as possible is the key
to really make sure that you're doing
the first step of prevention,
which is just making sure you don't have debris
or anything kind of around your space
because pests will find a way.
These guys have evolved for a long time.
So if you do end up finding that you have something,
I would recommend trying your hardest
to kind of get some good pictures of what it might be.
There are a lot of really helpful companies
that you can kind of reach out to to ask for guidance.
Hey, I snapped a picture of this.
Can you help me identify what it is?
So that that way, you know really what the best products
that you can seek out to help you kind of combat that
because there are some products
that don't work for particular pests.
So I definitely think kind of taking some time
identifying what you have through some help
or even just kind of pictures.
There's a bunch of beneficial insect companies
that are usually really helpful
in trying to help you out, identify it.
But really you wanna just make sure you understand
what it is that you're dealing with
so you can apply the proper products
in the right frequencies.
So yeah, I think just really understanding,
but you know what it is you might have.
If you're trying to prevent something,
you know, again, kind of that approach of,
what is my growth, my season?
A lot of beneficials, for example,
they need particular humidity ranges or temperature ranges.
So just taking some time to kind of do your research
and see what the best beneficial might be
so that you're applying them at the right time.
You know, there's a handful of bulk releases
that you could do.
You know, say you decided on a particular beneficial
with the help of somebody and said,
I'm gonna apply,
I noticed that I have a big infestation in my flower room.
I need to apply, say a bulk release of these beneficials.
So you can do kind of a bulk release
to try to get those numbers down.
There also are products of beneficials
that are called sachets.
So it's a slow release in that sachet.
So it's a wax coated little envelope.
They have some like bran in there.
They've got feeder mites.
Well, they're meant to be an approach to help you.
Like for us, we apply sachets right out of their transplant.
So, you know, after their final beneficial spray,
we'll put these sachets on.
Those last about,
they come to their peak usually about at week three.
So it's kind of like a bell curve.
These beneficials will slowly emerge from these sachets
and kind of just make sure
that your plant has long-term coverage.
Now, if you do walk in and you find that,
oh shit, I have something all over my plants,
you're gonna wanna make sure that you do
what we call a knock down spray.
So you wanna try to kill as much of them as possible.
So when you apply these other modes of action,
like a juvenile growth hormone,
you've knocked down as much of the population as possible
so that the next product that you apply,
you're not dealing with the same volume of pests.
So something that I always like to do
when I'm kind of teaching my crew about IPM is,
first step, see if you can find something
that's like a knockdown that's physically gonna kill them.
And then on, you know, see how well that works.
You wanna make sure you're making observations
on exactly what you're seeing, when you applied things,
what rate you applied them so you can say,
okay, was that enough?
Was that too much?
So just making sure that you properly identify
anything that you might have,
but prevention is always good to just make sure
that you've got kind of a good diversity
of things that you're applying.
So like those bunker plants or those plants
that were mentioned are great because those plants,
you know, those pests are gonna kind of seek those out.
Now, something that's really interesting
about pests in general that I find just fascinating
and Claude, you can jump in if you've got further stuff
to add, but I just find it so cool that, you know,
there, if you ever find that, hey,
there's a particular plant that these,
I'm seeing these on plants or I'm sorry, these pests,
you're seeing these pests on insects.
And I think particular insects have evolved different,
you know, they see differently than we do.
They can actually see visually weaker plants
and they'll seek those ones out.
So if a plant's defenses are naturally already pretty low,
they can actually see, find those plants
and kind of attack those plants.
So just being really good about what you're observing,
write some notes about, you know,
what it is that you're seeing
because you're gonna wanna try to keep scouting,
we call it, you wanna try to keep scouting
pretty frequently, but yeah, just kind of taking your time.
I know it's always really an oh shit moment
when you see something crawling on your plant,
but if, you know, it might not necessarily be a pest
if you're growing outdoors or,
so just really taking time to do your best to ID it,
find a good knockdown spray that's targeted to that pest
and then trying to bring in, you know,
different things that you can apply
that keep that mode of action different.
Now you don't have to apply five different things,
but you wanna make sure, you know,
whatever you're spraying,
you're changing it up in between sprays.
So some of the helpful things that I've learned
along the way to keep in mind,
whether that's, you know, a big production scale
or even as a home grower, you know,
those tips and tricks apply to both.
Awesome, well, thank you, Ashley.
Claude, before we get to Gardener,
who came up to ask a question or comment or statement,
I just wanted to ask you, you know,
like I'm a big fan of it.
And Ashley, on a couple of points that you pointed out
is depending on your situation,
I think it's very interesting.
Cause I come, you know, coming from a home perspective
where I'm doing a little bit more, you know,
organic gardening, I'm using a lot of different variants
of cover crop, like for me,
having mess and having decay is part of the process.
So it becomes a mitigating fact,
like how much pests do I have?
Do I have a predator to take these pests out?
If I pull the trigger on spraying neem oil, for example,
am I going to instantly create a problem for myself
that's a lot bigger or worse by creating an imbalance?
Cause like, if I look at it this way, right?
If I have Rover beetles and I have fungus gnats,
I have food for my Rover beetles and fungus gnats.
And as long as my fungus gnats aren't eating the roots
of my plants and they're mitigated enough,
this allows me to maintain a certain population
of Rover beetles.
And that's like not having to spend as much money, right?
Can you talk about, I would love to ask about,
but like what the, how to find that equilibrium
or are there certain things that do change
during this period?
I know like, for example,
some insects might feed on something that is smaller
than their usual food and thus might reduce their size.
And that could become a problem.
Could you talk on that a little bit
before we get into our question?
Yes, for sure.
I will bring on something I will add
for what Ashley said, very important.
It was really good points she brought up.
She was talking about the slow release sachets.
They're like little tea bags.
When you get the sachets,
you make sure that you never open up the little,
there's a tiny hole.
That's where they can be coming out of.
You make sure that the sachet is always placed
the most possible inside the foliage.
So it's not in direct sun or in the sprays away.
So that way they'll be after optimum conditions.
So that population will go from 250 or a thousand
to a thousand to 5,000,
depending on the size of the sachet.
And the sachets will be used
with different predatory mites like Swirsky,
Echumeris, Californicus,
depending on what pest that you have to fight.
So this is something I wanted to bring up.
That's really important because I've seen many facilities
or even home growers,
the sachets are not well placed.
They're always hanging low on the ground.
So they act as wick,
even if they had waxy or even fancy materials
like my, like other sachets I've seen.
So even then they'll soak up the water
and they'll ruin the sachet.
So there'll be a fast release sachets with no potential.
And also always, they always forget to lift them back up.
So you place them in the middle of the plant,
the most inside possible of the foliage is the best.
So like we were talking about Banker plants,
what is really interesting about when you're using,
it's a way when you use Banker plant,
I think that's what you brought up,
it's like we use them usually against green peach aphid.
And there's about six species of aphids.
If we talk about cannabis, like for other crops,
usually the aphids will be adapted to one species of plant
or a family of plants.
Some will be polyphagous.
They'll be eating many types of plant.
But if we could just concentrate on cannabis,
we would use Colemani and the Banker plant
just for peach and melon aphid.
For cannabis aphid, we will not use the Banker plants
because the kind of aphids that we use on the Banker plants,
Banker plants are like barley or wheat or oats
that is grown in a container
that will be infested with grain aphid.
Usually the cherry bird oat aphids.
I wanted to tell you the Latin word
because it's a tongue twister.
Anyways, so anyways, with that cherry bird oat aphids,
we infest these grains, which are monocotyledons.
So they're not dicotyledons.
So these kind of aphids won't go after your cannabis
or after your vegetables,
or they'll go after your chives or your wheat.
But they won't go after the dicotyledon.
So we use them as a kind of a farm for aphids.
So they will rear themselves,
they will breed on these aphids
and then they will leave this little Banker plant
to go and find other plants in the greenhouse,
which where there is aphid present.
And they will be able,
and what they do is that they will,
we have to reintroduce them after a while.
Anyways, even because they will be after generation,
there'll be morphological changes that will be happening.
They'll be getting smaller and smaller in size.
So they'll have more difficulty parasitizing
the melon or peach aphid.
So then what we do is that we need to reintroduce
some colemani.
To build back up the population.
But talking about these parasitoids,
the best one for cannabis aphid we found
was a effigious maticari.
Some companies and people would say it was a hervai
because it's a bit bigger,
but size doesn't always matter in nature.
And even the big guys in the Netherlands,
they found out after a year and a half of study
that the maticari parasitize twice as much cannabis aphid
as any other kind of parasitoid.
So, and I think I forgot another question
that you had London, if you're gonna,
you wanna go on.
My question would be like,
cause I wanna introduce people into growing at home
and using these things at home in a home environment.
Like often the first thing people tell me is like,
I'm gonna get bugs in my house.
Does that happen?
And then we're gonna get onto the questions
for the audience.
Okay, that's a really good question
that we really get really, really often.
First, I'll start like most of the species of insects
that we have are predatory mites are native.
They're all been accepted by this kind of convention.
There is between the States and Canada and Mexico.
Each country has its own set list of bugs.
Even in Canada, we have our own list of bugs
that is more limited like for Newfoundland.
So when I have customers in Newfoundland,
we have to go through this list that's more limited
than the rest of North America for different reasons.
And like, for example, we have predatory mite,
yellow laps, we cannot sell in the US.
This I'll talk about later on,
so that continue, bring me back on subject.
So you're asking me?
Are bugs gonna get out in my apartment?
Is there a risk of this?
Is there a good thing?
Cause I mean, a lot of people are growing in apartments
in their home or in their house.
And I just wanna.
Okay, okay.
Yes, okay.
So, okay.
So I was going really large now.
I was talking about the other regulations
that said about bugs and things like that.
So we wouldn't be able to sell invasive species.
So there was a mistake done about 30 years ago
when they introduced the Asian lady bug
that gets in everywhere, everybody's house.
It stings and it really stings a bit.
It's a really good predator,
but it's really invasive species.
So they won't be able to reproduce usually
if they have nothing to eat.
Like let's say for example,
a predator might like a cumulus,
if it will wander off, it will turn off to dust.
Predator might like persimmon will cannibalize each other
or our new super predator,
which I will talk about a bit later on.
And it's just back around the world,
you might get crazy might.
They will cannibalize each other.
About the crazy might, this is an exception though.
We're not totally 100% sure about people
with their own garden, how it's gonna be,
how they're gonna react to this really giant
predatory might going around.
Because they really run and they really go everywhere.
So this is mostly, I think, gonna be used in commercial.
So what we have an online store already,
everything that we sell on store,
let's say predatory might for your soil
against fungus slats and trips.
There's no problem there.
They'll never leave your pots usually.
Predatory might that we use in sachet
against trips and spider mites.
Like I said, they will cannibalize each other,
they'll turn to dust, they will die, they'll wander off.
They'll never be seen again.
When we use them in sachet too,
it's really good for flowering
because you won't have to sprinkle any bulk substrate
that they're carried in on your sticky trichomes.
So that's one of the reason also that sachets are used
and very useful in cannabis production.
Also, that's it.
So there's no way that they're gonna be able
to start a colony in your home.
And it evens answer another question.
Some people wanna start their own insect factory at home
to protect their plant.
You're able to get beneficial bugs for a while
inside your garden, let's say your mini greenhouse
or anything like that.
Let's say you wanna maintain aureus against trips,
the minute pirate bug,
you would get some ornamental peppers
or just regular pepper plants.
They really love to live in these pepper plants.
So that way you can maintain some aureus for a while
inside your vegetable garden.
If you have strictly have to be cannabis,
then aureus will only be used during the vegetation stage
because it will tend to go to sleep
if it has 12 hours of darkness and 12 hours of light
for two periods.
And there's no pollen present
because we're just growing female plants.
So there's no cucumber flowers or pepper flowers
for them to forage on pollen.
So that way they won't be able to make it.
But so there's ways,
like there's another bug called the Decyphus.
We use usually in tomato.
We haven't used it often in cannabis.
It's a fantastic bug against white flies and others,
but we get them melon plants
and they really like the melon plants
and they will introduce them once
and with the melon plants
and then we'll grow new melon plants.
And usually they'll be around for the whole cycle.
They'll maintain themselves.
So there's ways to maintain your insects
if you want them to be maintained,
but if not, usually there are no issues
that have been reported.
There'll be no harm for your pets or for humans
or them won't become a new nuisance.
And like I had said, Decyphus is the only bug I would say,
like they could cause damage
if there's no other pest to eat,
then sometimes it could go for your stems
and start to pierce your stems.
It happens sometime with tomato growers are too clean.
So, but besides that, I won't see any issue.
One of the funniest things I've ever had happen in my life
that I've ever heard is I got a phone call,
somebody was trying out bugs for the first time.
And they're like, they put a couple of stash down there
where the human environment take over.
And there was like a ton of spider mites,
like a lot of spider mites.
And they were just kind of, they're like,
oh my God, my plants are covered in bugs.
What have you done?
Like you've covered my plants now in bugs and I'm fucked.
It's like, don't spray those.
Don't get rid of those, they're good bugs.
Okay, bugs are bugs.
Sometimes it's better to have them there.
Well, Gardner, welcome to this stage.
We are in the last 30 minutes of the show.
You have a question or a comment
for our panel of experts or for bot?
If you're there, Kyle, you might be on mute.
All right, next person, Jason,
you can go ahead and raise your hand again there, Kyle.
I'm gonna move you to the audience.
Oh, sorry, come on back up.
I saw you come out there.
I feel you.
Of course, just as you bounced him, of course, right?
I know, I feel so terrible right now.
I'm like the worst human being on earth.
I'm so sorry, man.
Come on up.
You gotta get up here.
I sent you an invite right back.
So come on up and join.
And I do apologize.
When you did come up on stage, you did have an open mic.
So I muted you because there was other people talking
and it can create some sound issues.
But if you wanna come, there you are.
Welcome back up.
And then when you're done speaking,
make sure to just turn off that mic for me.
I appreciate it.
Go ahead.
Got it, guys.
Can you hear me okay?
Yes.
Fantastic.
Fantastic.
So admittedly, this was my first time on Clubhouse,
at least participating in a subject that I'm interested in.
So sorry for the folly.
Claude, I loved everything that you said.
I employ some of the methods that we discussed this evening
and learned a few things.
I have a small hobby farm in Southern Illinois
and I've been building up the, I guess,
biodiversity and bio for the last four years.
That said, during my day job, I work in biosecurity,
kind of the intersect of microbiology and chemistry.
And one of the particular areas of interest I have
is in our cordyceps and understanding the contact time
to when it actually kills the insect.
When we're using disinfectants like Sanodate or Oxidate
in a commercial setting with,
obviously we have this increased
regulatory scrutiny occurring,
does that have an impact, first of all,
on the spores of the cordyceps,
which might indicate applying more to it?
And how long does it take for the time
that that spore lands on the insect
and the growth dynamics take effect
and actually kill it?
Okay, thanks for your question, it's really good.
I just wanna add also, because when you use sprays,
if it's either oil or things like that,
then you have to just, in fact, for soaps or oil,
you let them dry and then you can apply your predators.
Then usually it's safe for them.
For cordyceps, that's it, like hydrogen peroxide,
for sure, will oxidize any fungal or bacterial
or organic matter it encounters
will turn into water and oxygen will oxidize it.
So if you use that Sanodate
and then you use the Bovaryo, just like for words,
then once it has oxidized everything
and it disinfected everything,
then it would be safe to use,
but you would kill, I mean,
if you use immediately the peroxide
after you applied or used it in conjunction,
then it wouldn't be compatible.
It would kill off the spores, that is for sure.
The spores, they act really quickly.
Usually it's about, I mean, they will touch the insect.
Their enemy, the main enemy of the spores is UV rays.
So they degrade at about 24 to 48 hours.
So that infection will have to happen.
There's a little bit of residual effect
that will happen with some spores left on the leaf
because we're doing a lot of research right now
with biofactors, like using predatory mites
to carry the Bovaryo spores
or even using pollinators for that.
So that's it.
The kind of disinfectants and everything,
they're not really compatible,
but the limited life, I mean, makes it,
you just have to alternate in between
to make sure that you don't kill
what you just applied the Bovaryos
that you wanted to get spec'd
and to make sure that also you want to sanitize
your installations.
This might come off as ridiculous,
but if you were to say clean every day,
would it make sense to also inoculate
with choroceptives every day as well
and increase that density
once you essentially clean the field?
You mean your question is to use it in the field?
No, no, no, not in the field,
but like within the soil biome
to continue to use it as a preventative.
Every time you clean or disinfect using an oxidant,
you should be reapplying these at the same rate.
I mean, you should like reapply the choroceptive
if need be, if there's presence of the pest,
that is for sure.
If not, I wouldn't use it as a preventative
because it has such a limited time of action.
I would use it if it has insects to contact,
to have a contact on.
I don't know if I'm asserting.
No, no, no, I was just inquiring
if it could be used as a preventative measure
rather before.
So like symptomology versus causality,
those thrips are in the ground.
If you were to apply it daily,
anytime they would emerge,
they would be affected by it.
It was just a preventative question,
but you answered it thoroughly and I understand.
Yes, it could be done,
but on an economic base, I wouldn't be.
There's also on the label,
there's no limit of application
and it's also non-phytotoxic.
So I mean, it could,
and for thrips, let's say you would spray,
it has limited action on the foliage for the adults.
I mean, not the adults,
I mean the two first larval stage,
but it has an effect on the pupa and pupa on the soil.
So it affects that more there.
So you do kind of a sprench
if you're using a Bovalia spray,
if you wanna get thrips.
So you get the foliage
and you also get the soil for four of the stages of the,
the only one that you won't get is the eggs in the adults,
the flying adults,
but you can knock them down with the sprays.
They're very happy to be flying around,
but I mean, meaning the Bovalia will get the,
mainly the pupa and the pupa on the ground
and some of the adults also on the foliage,
but it is most effectively for the stages in the ground.
So it happens naturally in the ground, the Bovalia.
It was found,
our strain was found on the Tarnish plant bug,
the first ones,
the first, I mean,
the first identification of our strain, the Anzalutri,
but that's it.
So as a prevention, it would be kind of hard,
I would say it was more, more, more of a curative.
Thank you.
Awesome.
Well, we have next up, Jason,
do you have your question or comment for Claude today?
I just wanted to say, I appreciate the information.
I do love talking about bugs and predators
and I'm a home cultivator
and I extensively use predators often.
I love them.
You know, London, I, you know, to correct you,
it's Rove, not Rover and it's the Delosia
and I love Rove beetles because they do,
that's another one that will last a really,
really long time.
Those are ones that you apply them
and they seem to keep themselves going for quite a while.
I appreciate the information on the Aureus,
you know, the pirate bugs,
they also don't breed in the flower, right?
So again, you don't want to even keep your banker plants
in your flower room.
You want to keep your banker plants in your bedroom.
Banker plants are very cool.
I'm actually growing some exploding ember plants right now,
specifically to use as banker plants for Aureus
and for cucumbers.
And so, yeah, no, just fantastic.
And I also appreciate you adding that tip on the sachets
because I think a lot of people are tempted
to open those up and just dump them on the plants
and you're really kind of wasting your money on that.
They're specifically designed to slowly release predators
over a certain amount of time.
Some of the sachets I use last five weeks,
so four or five weeks.
So you definitely want to take the time with that.
So yeah, no, just great conversation.
Anytime anybody's talking about predators,
I'm always interested.
And to add onto that conversation
about them escaping the tent, they don't.
They want to stay on the plants.
They're not going to go roaming around your house.
They want to be where the things are they're trying to eat.
They're going to stay by the plants.
They're going to stay where it's warmer.
They're going to stay in the light in many cases.
So they don't want to go anywhere.
And I also like parasitic wasps are fantastic for aphids.
I think that's one that really scares people,
the thought of releasing parasitic wasps in your house,
in your tent can be very scary.
But the reality is they don't sting people.
So yeah, no, awesome.
Thank you for joining tonight.
I appreciate you being here.
And thank you, Jason.
If I want to add, they're so tiny, the aphids,
that you have to really look at them close to see them.
I mean, so they will never sting you too.
So thanks for the...
And Delosia, you're right,
is another one that can maintain itself really long time.
Even I have customers often that have living soils,
they will reproduce themselves very easily.
And so often they find larvae of Delosia in their soil.
They're about to kill it.
I say, no, no, he's a good guy, leave him alone.
So-
Yeah, I've even seen them breeding
or present and in abundance in my worm bins occasionally too.
So yeah, they stick around.
But if I can add for Delosia, they're really great.
They're generalists, they eat, they run, they crawl,
they fly, they even swim almost.
Some of our customers use them to clean drains.
So they drop a container of Delosia in the drain
and down they go to feed.
And they interrupt aeroponic system
some kind of issue also with fungus snap.
Happened with that, we use them.
So yeah, they're really fantastic, the Rove Beetle.
Some people still call them Ateta,
but now their new name is Delosia.
Yeah, they do rename them every once in a while,
absolutely.
I'm voting for their next name to be Rover Beetle
cause they're like a Hoover vacuum meets Rove.
You know what I mean?
Like they really Hoover and Rover.
I'm going with that one.
And you know the problem is I'm never gonna say it right now
cause I've said it wrong for so long.
Leah, welcome to States.
Always wonder I'll see you.
Do you have a question or a comment for our panel?
Hi, yes.
First of all, the predatory bug side of things
is always fascinating.
And also the names get a little confusing
because there's multiple names for the same thing.
I'm definitely loved soaking in everything
that you've had to share tonight, Claude.
So thank you very much for sharing your knowledge on that.
One question that I do have,
cause I come across this sometimes is,
would you prefer in certain situations
or maybe which situations would you prefer
a pesticide versus a pest deterrent?
So maybe just making your environment less desirable
for those pests or actually moving into
actually destroying them.
Is there a preference?
Is there sort of a plan of action or a scale approach
to handling pests in an indoor environment versus outdoor?
Are you asking for general produce or cannabis?
Well, I guess I asked for general produce and or cannabis.
I work with companies that do both.
Okay.
In fact, me, I prefer to use like the sprays and everything
like say for to start clean or to like a knockdown
or reset, I call it,
to prepare for the, to reintroduce predatory mites
or predatory insects or parasitoids
to regain the balance, natural balance.
When we use sprays, I know customers,
I try to teach them and some learn and some not.
They buy bugs from us and they want them
and they kill them every week with their sprays.
And like, they don't have a good synchronization
or alternates if they want to use a spray.
So we have to choose in between.
Some people prefer to use sprays.
Some people prefer to use predatory insects.
So it's a choice and you can do a combination.
If you would do a good alternates between your products
and you know their properties, like use a soap or oil,
then let it dry, then introduce your predators.
This could be something I would only use,
depending, you could do with preventive sprays.
It could be used, especially if you had a history,
like let's say a powder mildew and you had plants
not far from your plants that have powder mildew,
then maybe you could like use a preventive spray
because you don't want the spores to reach your plants.
But powder mildew, the spores,
they will last for 16 days in the open
and about, they will last longer
if they are in vegetable debris.
They'll form cleostasis.
I don't know if it's the same word in English,
like fungal structures to withstand time.
But usually if your room is clean,
you won't have any powder mildew.
So I would like spray if only to start clean
for knockdown, for reset.
Usually I prefer to use the predator insects, parasitoids,
combination of compatible waste.
That's, for example, I can say,
if it's, I will use a pathogen Bovarya.
I will use a parasitoid Aphidius matricarii
and I will use the green lacewing, a predator,
or our newcomer Anesthes, the crazy mite,
together because they are compatible.
So that way I have a three way attack against,
it's the best way to,
just one way usually against Aphids is not enough.
You have to use many, many ways.
A predator, a parasitoid is the best
with a pathogen, even better.
So I hope I answered your question.
Thank you, I appreciate that.
Awesome, well, we're getting close to the end here.
So if you got some questions,
don't be afraid to throw them up here.
Ashley, did you wanna talk about
what you popped up at the top there?
We do have a hard stop at 6.30 tonight at PST.
So I don't wanna miss that,
but Ashley, what do you pop up
on the top of the screen there?
So that is just a link to a website that you can go,
don't be scared by looking at that website,
but look at whatever products you're thinking about using,
look for its active ingredient.
And then that website kind of walks you through
its mode of action in killing these pests.
So you don't have to get super creative and use,
like I said, five different ones.
We utilize usually three different modes of action
in all the preventatives that we apply.
But if you look at that link, you can kind of see,
is it a pyrethrin?
You can go to that link and that's actually an app too,
if you're ever really curious
about what it is that you're spraying.
There's an app called IRAC,
but that is just kind of helping you walk through
what the active ingredient in all of your sprays are
and how it actually works to combat that pest.
So just keep in mind, try to switch those up,
don't apply the same thing time and time again,
because that is how you build resistance.
So try to switch up,
you could have an insect growth regulator as one of them
and then switch it up with like a suffocation oil.
So just keep in mind when you guys are applying
your pesticides that like Claude said,
it's not the same mode of action.
A lot of these products that you can buy,
you just wanna make sure that you're paying attention
to what that active ingredient is.
So you're not just applying the same thing
over and over again, because soon that spray will not work
because everything that has lived through
the repeated sprays is now resistant to it.
So just a helpful tool to kind of make sure
you're looking at what that is and seeing how it works.
Thank you, Ashley.
And now I just, we got about nine minutes left here, Claude.
I really want, A, I wanna hear about this crazy mic
because that fucker sounds nuts.
B, I want you to give a little bit of a rundown
on where people can get ahold of you
and check out some of this stuff that you're working on
and who you're working with to do so.
Before we close out the show, we'll end it there.
Thank you very much, everybody,
for taking part in this evening.
Go ahead.
Thank you.
It was really a fun experience.
I'm a newbie here.
I'm gonna be more agile next time
with all the settings and everything.
So people can reach me at anetcisbioprotection.com.
I mean, this is our website.
You can write me an email at crobert,
at anetcisbioprotection.com,
C-R-O-B-E-R-T,
C-R-O-B-E-R-T, C-R-O-B-E-R-T,
all in one word, A-N-A-T-I-S, bioprotection.com.
So that's my email, or they can call me,
see me on LinkedIn too.
My webpage have some crazy video
about the list is the crazy mite.
You're gonna see it in action against aphids,
trips, and also whiteflies.
It's an amazing, amazing new predator.
It's a revolution now.
It's in the world of IPM.
It is in fact cosmopolitan predatory mite
that's found throughout the Northern hemisphere,
but it's also found in certain places
in the Southern hemisphere.
It's really large, really orange, really bright.
It's extremely fast.
They call it the whirligig mite
because it's always running erratically
and different patterns.
It goes across greenhouse structures.
It went across like greenhouses in record time,
just hanging on workers or just running.
It run between pots.
It never stops running.
The only time it stops running is to eat
and it's always hungry.
It's always hungry.
It is a top trips predator.
It is mostly, the most effect we've seen,
it was against trips.
We've seen it clean cages.
We've seen it clean microproducer place
in about six days of spider mites.
They will eat aphids.
They prefer the nymph of aphids,
though they do good control,
but you have to add something else to them for aphids,
like a parasitoid or another predator to team up with him.
It's really good against spider mites too.
It is a predator of echinotrips.
It is a fantastic new predator for mealybugs.
Never had a predator was efficient for mealybugs.
Psyllids, whiteflies, it even goes for the adults,
the whitefly adults.
It chomps on them like crazy.
Its life cycle is relatively long.
It lasts like the eggs will hatch and two larval stages.
And there was about three nymph stages
before they reached adulthood.
And they last about three to four weeks.
Outages are predatory,
mite are predatory and all mites are female usually.
They come into eggs and adult form.
Sadly for American listeners,
we cannot sell them to the USA yet.
They're gonna have to be approved by USDA.
They're working on that on export permits.
Right now we're distributing them across Canada.
So we have them in the bag formats
or 250 individual, a thousand K.
So they're really, you see them, they arrive,
they run through the bag.
They're really easy to do a quality control of them.
I wouldn't use them in the house setting.
I don't know what their behavior will be.
They are really easy to,
they will lay their own eggs really easily
compared to other predatory mites we had before.
They will lay their eggs in the substrate
or cryptic locations, never on the plants.
They're really crazy.
I'm playing again with this name.
Advantage of them is that they in cannabis,
they're wonderful because they can walk
across spider web, mite webs very with ease.
And they can walk across waxy surfaces or trichomes.
So they walk across trichomes, fully flowering plants.
They don't stick to them.
They just go around and do their thing.
So they're really something to see.
It's like, we're learning a lot about them still.
The thing is with cannabis is that the predators
always have a hard time going across the trichomes.
And like for aureus that we were talking about earlier,
we don't, they has a tendency to also stick into flowers,
and we don't want that.
So crazy mite, anisitis is not,
so anisitis from anisitis,
so it is not like that.
So it depends on the size of prey,
how many they'll eat every day.
But like I said, they're really so, so hungry.
And they also, the other advantage they have
is that they play well with others.
Like any good parent would like to hear from their children,
meaning they go well with other predators.
We tried with many types,
and they don't interfere with each other usually.
So it's really, really something to be.
We will be at the Grow Up Expo in Victoria.
We will be at, I will be also at the Growing Summit
in Kelowna in BC.
We'll be at Okanabiz in Toronto this coming June.
I will be also-
You're gonna be at the BC Craft Co-op,
BC Craft Summit on the Okanagan.
Yeah, the Growing Summit in Kelowna in the beginning
of April.
I forgot the dates, it's early April.
I think it's the fourth to the sixth, if I'm right.
I've rechecked it, but people can check on that.
I'm pretty sure it's the 19th to 20th.
I'm excited, because we're actually gonna do,
have you guys ever heard of,
you guys know Zach Galifianakis,
Between Two Ferns, his comedy,
kind of sit down and have a conversation.
We're doing that.
So we're gonna be, I'm actually,
I have to go end this call, this show pretty much now,
because I have to go to their town hall meeting
to organize this event.
Because like I said, we're gonna set up two ferns
in the middle of their consumption lounge
and just have people walk by and interview them.
So I expect for you to come sit down at my table
and smoke out of my jar of weed there, Claude,
at some point in time.
There is a rule.
And we're gonna do a whole live thing.
It's gonna be quite nuts.
So I'm really looking forward to that.
Thank you again, Claude, so much for coming today.
Thank you, Anita, Ashley, Corey, Josh,
Leah Gardner, everybody in the stage,
everybody in the audience,
everybody that comes on a regular basis.
Next week, we have an awesome show coming up.
We are talking about how cannabis affects the human body.
And we have an amazing guest speaker for that one as well,
a doctor, believe it or not, as usual.
And Claude, you're gonna be back again in March, I believe.
I wanna say around the 20th.
You are back to have a conversation,
or March or May, one or the other,
to have a conversation about what are we gonna do
getting into spring?
Because like I said, we really wanna kind of follow through
and see what we can each do in our way to protect it
and see what we can do to really protect our gardens
and have you grow along with us.
Cause I think it'll be fun.
Thanks everybody for paying attention
and thanks again, Claude, I appreciate it.
Thanks everyone.
Thanks again for a great show, Lyndon.
Thanks everyone.
At the stream.
Thank you all.
Thank you all.
I hope you enjoyed the show.
I look forward to seeing you again next week.
Ciao.
