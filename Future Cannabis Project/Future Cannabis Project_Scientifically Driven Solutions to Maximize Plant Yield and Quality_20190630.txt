[00:05.120 --> 00:12.120]  I want to get the ClipNotes version for all of us who missed your presentation.
[00:12.120 --> 00:13.120]  Okay.
[00:13.120 --> 00:14.120]  What did you want people to take away?
[00:14.120 --> 00:15.120]  Yeah, I'm able to hear this as well.
[00:15.120 --> 00:17.120]  First of all, what was the title of your presentation?
[00:17.120 --> 00:23.120]  A scientifically driven solution to enhance cannabis production, and I say with confidence
[00:23.120 --> 00:24.120]  and precision.
[00:24.120 --> 00:30.120]  And what I think about and how I structured this was kind of holistically conceiving the
[00:30.120 --> 00:37.120]  whole grow operation, the whole grow environment in terms of an ecological ecosystem.
[00:37.120 --> 00:38.120]  Right.
[00:38.120 --> 00:42.120]  You know, and in nature, which is my training, and I didn't think I'd ever do anything besides
[00:42.120 --> 00:47.120]  natural ecology as a microbial ecologist, learning about plant micro interactions, and I did
[00:47.120 --> 00:50.120]  a lot of climate change studies where we look at the environment.
[00:50.120 --> 00:53.120]  You know, this is traditional ecosystem sciences.
[00:53.120 --> 00:58.120]  Well, I love taking that concept and putting it into the grow room.
[00:58.120 --> 01:03.120]  And I tell everybody, you know, there's only one thing you have to control in precision
[01:03.120 --> 01:05.120]  agriculture, and it's everything.
[01:05.120 --> 01:06.120]  It's everything.
[01:06.120 --> 01:10.120]  You know, it starts with plant genetics, it starts and stops with plant genetics, and
[01:10.120 --> 01:14.120]  then I give this 11 parameters for success.
[01:14.120 --> 01:19.120]  You know, and the very last one I talk about, the very bottom is soil microbes.
[01:19.120 --> 01:24.120]  You have energy and you have temperature and you have airflow and you have humidity and
[01:24.120 --> 01:31.120]  you have CO2 and you have oxygen in the rhizosphere below ground and hydrology and root temperature
[01:31.120 --> 01:33.120]  and nutrients.
[01:33.120 --> 01:34.120]  And then there's microbes.
[01:34.120 --> 01:39.120]  And the fascinating thing about it is treating that as an interaction of ecology.
[01:39.120 --> 01:41.120]  And you better understand what all of them do.
[01:41.120 --> 01:44.120]  And if you tweak anything, you're going to have to change everything else.
[01:44.120 --> 01:45.120]  Because it affects.
[01:45.120 --> 01:46.120]  Yeah.
[01:46.120 --> 01:48.120]  And so you're going to appreciate this.
[01:48.120 --> 01:53.120]  You know the typical phenotype formula, P equals genetics plus environment plus that interaction
[01:53.120 --> 01:57.120]  of genetics times environment plus a standard error variability over time.
[01:57.120 --> 02:01.120]  I present that in my talks in terms of precision agriculture.
[02:01.120 --> 02:03.120]  Because it's basically the same thing.
[02:03.120 --> 02:08.120]  You start with genetics and then the E is everything else.
[02:08.120 --> 02:10.120]  Everything, including nutrient inputs.
[02:10.120 --> 02:11.120]  And you have to dial in all those things.
[02:11.120 --> 02:13.120]  So this is a huge bucket.
[02:13.120 --> 02:15.120]  And then dialing in that interaction.
[02:15.120 --> 02:16.120]  Right.
[02:16.120 --> 02:19.120]  And making sure those right genetics are right for your environment.
[02:19.120 --> 02:21.120]  Because not all genetics are meant to grow up here.
[02:21.120 --> 02:22.120]  Right.
[02:22.120 --> 02:25.120]  Because there's the photosynthetic equation, too, that comes into it.
[02:25.120 --> 02:26.120]  Yeah.
[02:26.120 --> 02:34.120]  And so conceptually, the growers that are newer are like, oh, it's beautiful and kind of daunting.
[02:34.120 --> 02:36.120]  Because you're like, oh, I have all this stuff.
[02:36.120 --> 02:39.120]  But once you know the picture, you know the buckets that you can start working on.
[02:39.120 --> 02:46.120]  And then I kind of transition that to talk about the importance of microbes playing that very, very small part in that ecosystem.
[02:46.120 --> 02:48.120]  Which is a huge part.
[02:48.120 --> 02:55.120]  And I talk about some of the challenges in nature and nutrient use efficiencies and how you can actually maximize the success of plants.
[02:55.120 --> 03:01.120]  And I kind of talk about how, you know, as a matter of fact, no plant in nature exists without plant-microbe interactions.
[03:01.120 --> 03:02.120]  Why is that?
[03:02.120 --> 03:04.120]  You know, they support the success of life.
[03:04.120 --> 03:08.120]  And I talk about the human microbiome, how we know now microbes support all our health.
[03:08.120 --> 03:10.120]  The same thing for plants and every other life.
[03:10.120 --> 03:16.120]  And so you put microbes in the concept of that bigger picture of cultivation.
[03:16.120 --> 03:21.120]  And then you understand how we can start formulating microbes with precision and confidence.
[03:21.120 --> 03:25.120]  So growers can use these in precision agriculture settings.
[03:25.120 --> 03:26.120]  So you know what they do.
[03:26.120 --> 03:27.120]  We're talking about targeted function.
[03:27.120 --> 03:29.120]  We're talking about efficacy.
[03:29.120 --> 03:32.120]  We're talking about things like shell flap also, all these things.
[03:32.120 --> 03:39.120]  But if you can do that, and then you can show the results, not only from a scientific point of view, from a microbial ecologist point of view.
[03:39.120 --> 03:47.120]  I started realizing my purpose and impact of bringing nature and natural processes to agriculture.
[03:47.120 --> 03:53.120]  But we're doing it sustainably, not only because of the nature of bringing nature to agriculture, but because we're doing it profitably.
[03:53.120 --> 04:00.120]  And you can't do a lot of things with success in the market unless you bring profit to your end user.
[04:00.120 --> 04:07.120]  But if you can align profit with sustainability, you really have a true sustainable technology.
[04:07.120 --> 04:09.120]  And so that's kind of the big picture of the talk.
[04:09.120 --> 04:13.120]  And we go into a lot of details about data and our publications.
[04:13.120 --> 04:20.120]  And so it's about fitting that one soil microbial piece into the puzzle.
[04:20.120 --> 04:25.120]  That's probably everything else in that ecosystem is not necessarily well understood.
[04:25.120 --> 04:27.120]  It's more and more understood.
[04:27.120 --> 04:29.120]  You talk about the living soil concepts.
[04:29.120 --> 04:32.120]  I just went up to the lift show in Canada.
[04:32.120 --> 04:35.120]  And who doesn't have a million square feet up there now?
[04:35.120 --> 04:38.120]  I mean, literally almost every grower I went to, it's ridiculous.
[04:38.120 --> 04:43.120]  And some of those facilities are turning the whole million into a living soil growth.
[04:43.120 --> 04:46.120]  I'm like, what? That's awesome.
[04:46.120 --> 04:47.120]  I can't believe it.
[04:47.120 --> 04:50.120]  And that's changed very quickly.
[04:50.120 --> 04:51.120]  And you're an organic grower.
[04:51.120 --> 04:56.120]  You understand that until you understand, it's not like plugging synthetics in.
[04:56.120 --> 04:59.120]  It's a little bit of a process and a learning curve.
[04:59.120 --> 05:04.120]  And you can reap the benefits and rewards on the back end if you can go through that learning stage.
[05:04.120 --> 05:08.120]  Right. And get to know what you're working with and how to put it all together.
[05:08.120 --> 05:14.120]  Like you were saying, in all the little factors, I feel like everyone assumes, oh, yeah, it's just soil microbes.
[05:14.120 --> 05:15.120]  They just put it in there.
[05:15.120 --> 05:20.120]  And it's like, well, what does each one of those microbes do specifically in your soil biosphere?
[05:20.120 --> 05:25.120]  What other microbes or bacteria is that interacting with that's causing this to happen?
[05:25.120 --> 05:27.120]  And it gets very intricate.
[05:27.120 --> 05:31.120]  And it's harder to measure because they're microscopic.
[05:31.120 --> 05:34.120]  And so you're looking for responses when you're adding.
[05:34.120 --> 05:38.120]  And so you really have to have confidence with manufacturers and make sure they've done their diligence.
[05:38.120 --> 05:42.120]  And you still have to be diligent and do your own diligence as a grower.
[05:42.120 --> 05:44.120]  But I put it in concepts of things that you can measure.
[05:44.120 --> 05:52.120]  Like think about if you turn your grow room temperature down 10 degrees or up 10 degrees, do your plants respond to that?
[05:52.120 --> 05:53.120]  Most definitely.
[05:53.120 --> 05:59.120]  Absolutely. Or if you change your light, you know, does that change everything from a low intensity to a high intensity?
[05:59.120 --> 06:02.120]  Yes. Or what if you double the CO2 in a room?
[06:02.120 --> 06:03.120]  Yeah.
[06:03.120 --> 06:05.120]  What happens? You have to change everything else.
[06:05.120 --> 06:08.120]  Well, the microbial component is the same thing.
[06:08.120 --> 06:10.120]  There's a little more finesse.
[06:10.120 --> 06:13.120]  And microbes don't help with any of those macro environmental conditions.
[06:13.120 --> 06:15.120]  You have to get that right.
[06:15.120 --> 06:25.120]  But it allows younger growers to fix a lot of problems if there's a nutrient lockout and really add that component, which isn't as measurable, except for on the back.
[06:25.120 --> 06:27.120]  And we see significant increases in quality and yield.
[06:27.120 --> 06:38.120]  And you can maximize what I think the phenotypic potential of the plant because you're maximizing the overall plant's potential to be healthy through those healthy rhizosphere interactions and nutrient uptake.
[06:38.120 --> 06:43.120]  And then we've also talked to many growers who are completely maxed out.
[06:43.120 --> 06:45.120]  They've dialed in the room perfectly.
[06:45.120 --> 06:48.120]  And there's that one missing component.
[06:48.120 --> 06:52.120]  And also it's that catalyst just to up it to the next level.
[06:52.120 --> 07:01.120]  And they're not seeing the same delta or increase in yield as the newer growers, but they're getting that extra 5% that they never thought they could achieve.
[07:01.120 --> 07:03.120]  They're getting that little bit extra.
[07:03.120 --> 07:04.120]  Yeah.
[07:04.120 --> 07:12.120]  And that top 5% is a hugely difficult percent to get because you're really pushing the plant and being precision.
[07:12.120 --> 07:19.120]  And so I love thinking about using nature and natural processes and microbes in general with precision because it's a new concept.
[07:19.120 --> 07:25.120]  And to bring them together to create something that is far superior than anything you could create before that.
[07:25.120 --> 07:26.120]  Yeah.
[07:26.120 --> 07:27.120]  So I geek out on it.
[07:27.120 --> 07:29.120]  You can tell I'm pretty passionate about it.
[07:29.120 --> 07:30.120]  No, it's awesome.
[07:30.120 --> 07:32.120]  I mean, yeah, microbes rule the world.
[07:32.120 --> 07:33.120]  Microbes and bacteria rule the world.
[07:33.120 --> 07:34.120]  It's absolutely true.
[07:34.120 --> 07:42.120]  Have you ever done any research or has anybody on light and microbes?
[07:42.120 --> 07:45.120]  Because I think of like sunlight and then indoor lights.
[07:45.120 --> 07:54.120]  And then I also think of light affects the plant, which exudes, you know, it sends out sugars to attract the right microbes.
[07:54.120 --> 07:59.120]  But then also certain microbes react to sunlight.
[07:59.120 --> 08:00.120]  Right.
[08:00.120 --> 08:05.120]  So I don't think about that latter part as much as I think about that first part.
[08:05.120 --> 08:07.120]  And you think about the response.
[08:07.120 --> 08:09.120]  You can't measure anything directly.
[08:09.120 --> 08:12.120]  And it's very challenging because you're dealing with microscopic life.
[08:12.120 --> 08:18.120]  But if you can improve the energy and the resources, you're going to improve the photosynthate.
[08:18.120 --> 08:30.120]  And if you improve that food source, increase a food source, squirt it into the rhizosphere, priming basically sugars, you're going to maximize or improve and increase the microbial diversity, the microbial activity.
[08:30.120 --> 08:33.120]  And so you have to measure that over a period of time.
[08:33.120 --> 08:35.120]  I wrote some papers early on.
[08:36.120 --> 08:39.120]  I called it BPMI for the study.
[08:39.120 --> 08:46.120]  And it was called Visualizing Plant-Microbe Interactions, where I had four different grasses and an invasive grass, cheatgrass.
[08:46.120 --> 08:49.120]  And I did an infield experiment and a greenhouse experiment.
[08:49.120 --> 09:00.120]  And over time, we would look at how different grasses, as an example, in the same environment, the same climate, might differentially influence the rhizosphere microbiome.
[09:01.120 --> 09:09.120]  And the hypothesis was that maybe cheatgrass, which is an invasive grass that's taken over the U.S., it was planted naturally because it was a fast-growing grass.
[09:09.120 --> 09:14.120]  And it turns out, like every other biological transplant, that it wasn't that great of an idea because it's too aggressive.
[09:14.120 --> 09:16.120]  It dies quick. You know the story.
[09:16.120 --> 09:28.120]  But I thought maybe cheatgrass is a hypothesis is even more successful because they can nurture a specific rhizosphere microbiome to enhance nutrient cycling to make them more competitive.
[09:28.120 --> 09:30.120]  And so that was the basis of that study.
[09:30.120 --> 09:33.120]  And it turns out the study supported that.
[09:33.120 --> 09:35.120]  It's published in Soil Biology and Biogeochemistry.
[09:35.120 --> 09:43.120]  And that's an example where we just start thinking about the plant by itself and these different cultivars or species being able to influence that.
[09:43.120 --> 09:47.120]  And it's very difficult to measure that because you have to measure it over time.
[09:47.120 --> 09:50.120]  And it takes a lot of finesse, a lot of methodology.
[09:50.120 --> 09:52.120]  And we're equipped to do that.
[09:52.120 --> 09:54.120]  But it takes a lot of destructive harvesting also.
[09:54.120 --> 09:58.120]  So it takes a real experimental design to get to that resolution.
[09:58.120 --> 10:00.120]  And a lot of it's correlative.
[10:00.120 --> 10:05.120]  And so the questions actually initiate tons of hypotheses.
[10:05.120 --> 10:10.120]  And the research isn't very well established yet on those exact mechanisms.
[10:10.120 --> 10:17.120]  Just like any other ecology system, we used to do plant microbe interactions in a whole series of global climate change experiments.
[10:17.120 --> 10:20.120]  Where we would have rain out and we would have extra rain.
[10:20.120 --> 10:23.120]  And we would have heating pads and CO2.
[10:23.120 --> 10:25.120]  And this space study in Wyoming, it was awesome.
[10:25.120 --> 10:27.120]  Super geeked out.
[10:27.120 --> 10:29.120]  A lot of money went into that trial.
[10:29.120 --> 10:31.120]  Figuring out all the different variables.
[10:31.120 --> 10:34.120]  And then you have to measure all these variables separately and put them together in modeling.
[10:34.120 --> 10:36.120]  And then modeling is gluing this together.
[10:36.120 --> 10:38.120]  And there's a level of error.
[10:38.120 --> 10:46.120]  And so there is such a huge road ahead of us in really understanding how those interactions.
[10:46.120 --> 10:47.120]  And that's the biggest challenge.
[10:47.120 --> 10:54.120]  A lot of network analysis is a new tool that comes up to allow us to understand more real time.
[10:54.120 --> 10:57.120]  What those responses that you're talking about, Peter, are.
[10:57.120 --> 11:01.120]  But tying those together is a very challenging thing for scientists right now.
[11:01.120 --> 11:03.120]  Well, how about this?
[11:03.120 --> 11:07.120]  You guys have an R&D capability.
[11:07.120 --> 11:13.120]  What in the past, let's say, four years are some of the things you've researched?
[11:13.120 --> 11:16.120]  And what were the results?
[11:16.120 --> 11:17.120]  So that's a great question.
[11:17.120 --> 11:24.120]  And here's where it distinguishes at some point a fundamental research program and applied research program.
[11:24.120 --> 11:26.120]  And we had to bridge the gap.
[11:26.120 --> 11:28.120]  And it's a very painful thing to do for any scientist.
[11:28.120 --> 11:33.120]  You know, you want to ask questions from the very beginning and follow it through all the way.
[11:33.120 --> 11:35.120]  And you're never going to get to the end of what really matters.
[11:35.120 --> 11:39.120]  You make these assumptions that, oh, I saw this little mechanism early on in planting.
[11:39.120 --> 11:42.120]  And then you make this bold statement in academia.
[11:42.120 --> 11:45.120]  And so that, of course, is going to lead to increased plant health, quality, and yield.
[11:45.120 --> 11:49.120]  But you're not measuring often plant health, quality, and yield.
[11:49.120 --> 11:51.120]  We realized at the very end when you talked to farmers,
[11:51.120 --> 11:54.120]  and farmers want to see plant health, quality, and yield data,
[11:54.120 --> 11:59.120]  that if you're going to turn your science program into an applied science program,
[11:59.120 --> 12:01.120]  you better provide that data for the farmer.
[12:01.120 --> 12:05.120]  And you do that by completely flipping your train of thought.
[12:05.120 --> 12:14.120]  And you take a leap of faith that what you're doing is interacting with the plant the way you think you know it is
[12:14.120 --> 12:17.120]  from your expertise and years of study.
[12:17.120 --> 12:19.120]  But you measure plant health, quality, and yield.
[12:19.120 --> 12:22.120]  And then you start reverse engineering what those mechanisms are.
[12:22.120 --> 12:24.120]  And you measure a couple along the way.
[12:24.120 --> 12:27.120]  But the details are very involved.
[12:27.120 --> 12:30.120]  And it takes a lot of time and a ton of resources.
[12:30.120 --> 12:43.120]  And so we focus on early on now on our early research programs the needle that moves the influencer hurdle for farmers.
[12:43.120 --> 12:48.120]  If we have a rooting agent, for example, or a microbe that we think is going to instigate rooting,
[12:48.120 --> 12:51.120]  there's a lot of mechanisms into that.
[12:51.120 --> 12:54.120]  But what I want to know for sure is this rooting increase.
[12:54.120 --> 12:59.120]  And, you know, I can measure mechanisms in a thousand different samples and never get to that.
[12:59.120 --> 13:06.120]  But if you measure a thousand samples for increased root growth, and then you find that increased root growth,
[13:06.120 --> 13:09.120]  and then you say, okay, what's happening here?
[13:09.120 --> 13:14.120]  And you start making hypotheses there and measuring certain things in the next study.
[13:14.120 --> 13:18.120]  And, you know, we've just had this huge R&D team for the last 18 months.
[13:18.120 --> 13:21.120]  And we're talking years, five-year studies, actually.
[13:21.120 --> 13:24.120]  Well, you just start spiderwebbing off in all these new directions.
[13:24.120 --> 13:26.120]  And it's like, well, this is happening over here.
[13:26.120 --> 13:28.120]  And this is going on at the same time over here.
[13:28.120 --> 13:31.120]  We should probably both look at both of these and see what happens.
[13:31.120 --> 13:32.120]  And then it takes that.
[13:32.120 --> 13:36.120]  And then the fundamental aspects of the science kick in.
[13:36.120 --> 13:40.120]  And then as a co-founder of a company, unfortunately, I'll be like, wait a minute.
[13:40.120 --> 13:43.120]  We have our metric for success.
[13:43.120 --> 13:46.120]  We can't understand all the mechanisms right now.
[13:46.120 --> 13:47.120]  We have a company.
[13:47.120 --> 13:48.120]  We have a scientific company.
[13:48.120 --> 13:51.120]  And we're measuring repeatable end results.
[13:51.120 --> 13:53.120]  And we have to do that.
[13:53.120 --> 13:54.120]  And we have to measure.
[13:54.120 --> 13:57.120]  And that makes my hypothesis to make sure we know some modes of action.
[13:57.120 --> 14:03.120]  But to know the complete sequence of interactions and chemical synthesis
[14:03.120 --> 14:07.120]  or chemical interactions and signaling that make that happen,
[14:07.120 --> 14:13.120]  it's not economically feasible at the company, private company level.
[14:13.120 --> 14:16.120]  And that's what you do all day long in academia.
[14:16.120 --> 14:17.120]  You never get to that end game.
[14:17.120 --> 14:19.120]  But you geek out on the details.
[14:19.120 --> 14:20.120]  Yeah.
[14:20.120 --> 14:23.120]  And other than that, yeah, all what he was saying tied right back into how
[14:23.120 --> 14:26.120]  effectively the nutrients can make their way into the plant
[14:26.120 --> 14:31.120]  and how effectively the environment is allowing for photosynthesis to take place
[14:31.120 --> 14:37.120]  between chlorophyll and A and B production and carbohydrates and all of that.
[14:37.120 --> 14:43.120]  There's 100 parameters you have to measure to get a chance at a snapshot of what's going on.
[14:43.120 --> 14:48.120]  And you've got to remember, if you collect data at day 5 of a plant growth
[14:48.120 --> 14:54.120]  and day 10 and day 15 and day 20, you know you have one snapshot at one time of the day.
[14:54.120 --> 14:59.120]  And then things happen on a daily cycle, not a weekly cycle.
[14:59.120 --> 15:02.120]  And so there's all these assumptions you have to make,
[15:02.120 --> 15:05.120]  even when you're collecting this ecological data at that level.
[15:05.120 --> 15:08.120]  So another random question.
[15:08.120 --> 15:16.120]  If you took a gallon of super happy microbes and put half in a living soil environment
[15:16.120 --> 15:21.120]  and half you put into like synthetic fertilizer,
[15:21.120 --> 15:26.120]  what's going on with like, are those ones just totally unhappy?
[15:26.120 --> 15:30.120]  So I would say a general statement, absolutely.
[15:30.120 --> 15:33.120]  And I'll tell you why, because they haven't evolved in that environment.
[15:33.120 --> 15:37.120]  You know, if you take microbes directly from soil, we could do this tomorrow.
[15:37.120 --> 15:41.120]  I could go show you how to grow microbes and we'll grow a bunch of them from whatever source you want.
[15:41.120 --> 15:42.120]  I'm an expert at growing microbes.
[15:42.120 --> 15:45.120]  And we take them directly from soil and we grow them up pretty quickly.
[15:45.120 --> 15:50.120]  That first growing event, you're going to lose over 50% of the microbes that existed in that soil.
[15:50.120 --> 15:54.120]  Because you put them in an environment they haven't been able to evolve into,
[15:54.120 --> 15:58.120]  and you have to ease them into any new environment.
[15:58.120 --> 16:00.120]  And so you've knocked out 50%.
[16:00.120 --> 16:03.120]  And this is generally, you know, I haven't counted, but I've experienced this before.
[16:03.120 --> 16:08.120]  And so you're only capturing the readily culturable microbes that will grow in two or three day period,
[16:08.120 --> 16:13.120]  not that grow over a 10 day period or not that can't grow well or just got over-competed.
[16:13.120 --> 16:15.120]  So you've automatically biased that.
[16:15.120 --> 16:18.120]  And then you separate those and we'll grow them up.
[16:18.120 --> 16:23.120]  And we put half in a living soil environment and half in a salt, high salt environment.
[16:23.120 --> 16:30.120]  What you're going to have is a living soil environment that more naturally mimics the soil condition that they're from.
[16:30.120 --> 16:33.120]  And so in general, hypothetically, this is hypothesis,
[16:33.120 --> 16:37.120]  most of those microbes or much more of those microbes will survive in that soil
[16:37.120 --> 16:43.120]  because that's an environment that mimics their environment that they evolved into initially.
[16:43.120 --> 16:50.120]  The other half, they just got put in a very environmentally stressful environment,
[16:50.120 --> 16:52.120]  and you're going to knock out probably 90% of them.
[16:52.120 --> 16:56.120]  And that's one of the findings that we found when we were culturing microbes
[16:56.120 --> 17:00.120]  and talking to farmers before we started our R&D back at the university.
[17:00.120 --> 17:07.120]  When I heard from a farmer that he loved the idea of using precision microbes like we were hypothesizing creating,
[17:07.120 --> 17:11.120]  and that the only way that he was going to use them,
[17:11.120 --> 17:15.120]  because he couldn't make a special trip over his field to apply it to the field,
[17:15.120 --> 17:18.120]  too much fuel, too much cost, he couldn't change a thing.
[17:18.120 --> 17:25.120]  So he was going to take any microbe that I gave him and dump it in a hot fertilizer tank and spread it at the same time.
[17:25.120 --> 17:30.120]  I had an aha moment. I thought, whoa, I don't think microbes can do that.
[17:30.120 --> 17:34.120]  And the truth is, most of them can't.
[17:34.120 --> 17:39.120]  So you have to understand, and that's why I love what we've done with Mammoth Pea,
[17:39.120 --> 17:43.120]  we understood that going into the R&D, not after the fact,
[17:43.120 --> 17:49.120]  and we understood that we needed to evolve microbes to be able to withstand that environment
[17:49.120 --> 17:53.120]  or weed them out through selection before we took them to market,
[17:53.120 --> 17:55.120]  because then they wouldn't be a viable product.
[17:55.120 --> 18:03.120]  And so if that kind of told the story, most microbes can't survive any transplant.
[18:03.120 --> 18:07.120]  Some can, and very, very few can bridge that gap.
[18:07.120 --> 18:09.120]  Yeah.
[18:09.120 --> 18:11.120]  Yeah.
[18:11.120 --> 18:16.630]  Okay.
[18:16.630 --> 18:18.630]  That was fun.
[18:18.630 --> 18:20.630]  Yeah, thank you.
