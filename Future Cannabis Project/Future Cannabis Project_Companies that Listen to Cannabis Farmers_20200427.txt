I'm a person that tries to get people successful with your product and these are the things that I regularly see and
so far the only people the only people really that have been receptive to our feedback has been
grassroots fabric pots and
sustainable village
Which is who sells the blue mats no other
Agricultural I think Tyler is actually watching right now. Yeah, what's up Tyler?
But
Grassroots has been great. They listen to the market and they make changes and you know sustainable village
Those are the people that sells blue mats out in Colorado. They do the same thing
I've had a running dialogue with Steve from blue mats for five six years now and they make updates based on
what we're seeing in the field and you know, there's this resistance or this like culture like was being said way at the beginning is
you know, there's this
clashing of cultures and clashing of
We're on this team or you're on the weed team and so far
zero tea brewer manufacturers have been receptive to our feedback zero spray manufacturers have been receptive to our feedback and
You know at some point
Somebody will fill those niches, but you know, can you talk about some iterative?
product development blue mat based on the feedback like what did you say if
That was a great screen grab
Well
The
Yeah, there's been a lot of evolution with the blue mats
You know the original systems used a lot of carrots
Which is the sensor part that functions it and it uses a lot of the distribution drippers the downside of those is a horrendous cost
Because all those little bits are the most expensive and the more carrots you put into a building
the more
Opportunities for failure you had and we experienced that, you know, the first real big facility
We installed them in was like sixty five thousand square feet
And that was before all the blue so close was really kind of dialed in and working well
So I stuck to the old tried and true and it was far too many carrots in a facility and it was to be honest
It didn't go well
You know, I would have liked to see it gone better and unfortunately that cultivator
You know doesn't say the nicest things about the blue mat system still to this day and but you know working with you know
the Steve and
and James and
Michael Michael's been really big over there. It's sustainable village and you know, we've
Evolving how we install the systems and I feel like right now where we're at like, you know
The blue silk manifold system is working really well, and there's three or four different variations that are going out right now
You know, my personal is a little bit different than what they sell
but you know now instead of being you know, ten thousand dollars for a
4,000 square foot building you're down to like two to three thousand
So now it's kind of doable but on the same thing like, you know over it
You know
One of the farms both Kevin and I you know, Kevin introduced us to they put it in
You know, they put it on half the building to prove concept
And so as I would say a pretty good trial because it was the you know
One side had it one side didn't they all got the same treatment and the side with the blue mats had 28% more flower
You know, that's pretty markable return on investment for a couple grand
but still it's you know, it's
It's
We just it's it's really hard to convince these facilities to make the decisions that will help them ultimately
That's that's one of our biggest obstacles is you know, a lot of times so many other
Bad things have happened that now when it's time to make a call that will really really help you
It's hard to pull the trigger
