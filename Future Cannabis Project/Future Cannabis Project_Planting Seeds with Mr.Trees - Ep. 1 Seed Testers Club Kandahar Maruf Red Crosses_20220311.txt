[00:00.000 --> 00:03.920]  We are live everybody, welcome.
[00:03.920 --> 00:06.160]  I find I gotta pull the trigger sometimes
[00:06.160 --> 00:08.320]  or like I'll debate on going live
[00:08.320 --> 00:13.040]  for like a good half an hour before we actually do so.
[00:13.040 --> 00:14.780]  I'm fucking so pumped.
[00:14.780 --> 00:17.560]  I'm really excited because I have gotten the opportunity
[00:17.560 --> 00:18.680]  to share space with you before,
[00:18.680 --> 00:20.440]  but I haven't really gotten the opportunity
[00:20.440 --> 00:22.160]  to actually talk to you personally.
[00:22.160 --> 00:24.520]  So we have Corey and Mr. Treece here.
[00:24.520 --> 00:25.340]  I'm excited.
[00:25.340 --> 00:28.920]  So do you wanna like introduce kind of the concept
[00:28.920 --> 00:32.440]  a little bit there, Mr. Treece and exactly what it is
[00:32.440 --> 00:34.800]  so I don't butcher the fucking name right off the bat
[00:34.800 --> 00:36.020]  like we discussed,
[00:36.020 --> 00:38.120]  or we just talk about what we're gonna smoke
[00:38.120 --> 00:39.840]  right off the bat and light up.
[00:39.840 --> 00:41.600]  One or the other I think is the options
[00:41.600 --> 00:43.640]  that are within in front of us.
[00:43.640 --> 00:45.680]  Yeah, you know, I don't know
[00:45.680 --> 00:47.360]  if I'm gonna say it properly either.
[00:47.360 --> 00:51.280]  You know, I'm a redneck farmer,
[00:51.280 --> 00:52.560]  a hundred percent through and through.
[00:52.560 --> 00:54.480]  So I'll butcher it myself,
[00:54.480 --> 00:58.560]  but we're gonna talk mostly about the Kandahar Marf,
[00:59.240 --> 01:04.240]  which is basically the Kandahar Afghani dead body,
[01:07.440 --> 01:10.600]  turps, one of the,
[01:10.600 --> 01:14.360]  that particular stock went through one of the coldest snaps
[01:14.360 --> 01:18.360]  in that area's history and stood strong and tolerated it
[01:18.360 --> 01:21.600]  when other stuff rotted and died in the cold.
[01:21.600 --> 01:24.800]  And when it went through that cold, it turned dark red,
[01:24.800 --> 01:27.360]  all the leaves turned dark blood red.
[01:27.400 --> 01:29.600]  And that's where it got the name, the red,
[01:29.600 --> 01:33.360]  there's the green, there's a black.
[01:33.360 --> 01:35.320]  So hold up a second.
[01:35.320 --> 01:37.320]  You said that,
[01:37.320 --> 01:39.340]  because I saw your photos recently
[01:39.340 --> 01:40.580]  that you post on Instagram
[01:40.580 --> 01:43.160]  that like you showed this beautiful frozen
[01:43.160 --> 01:45.560]  like seedling volunteer that had popped up,
[01:45.560 --> 01:49.560]  but you're talking about the plants had froze during flower
[01:49.560 --> 01:51.840]  and had succeeded to survive.
[01:51.840 --> 01:53.160]  That's quite impressive.
[01:53.160 --> 01:55.520]  Yeah, it's like those small seeds.
[01:55.520 --> 01:57.960]  In Afghanistan, it was one of these cold snaps
[01:57.960 --> 02:00.880]  that ripped through that little area.
[02:00.880 --> 02:05.280]  And like the story has it from ears
[02:05.280 --> 02:07.640]  and it was from Indian land rates exchange
[02:07.640 --> 02:10.480]  that yeah, those are the ones that tolerated the cold,
[02:10.480 --> 02:13.840]  stood strong and then most of the stuff that they get,
[02:13.840 --> 02:16.420]  they don't really get to make a lot of the selections.
[02:16.420 --> 02:19.240]  They just get it out of the bricks
[02:19.240 --> 02:21.120]  or out of the buds that are already taken care of.
[02:21.120 --> 02:24.000]  But those particular ones were selected.
[02:24.000 --> 02:26.000]  They got to look at the plant and pull it out of there
[02:26.000 --> 02:30.380]  and really make a decent choice.
[02:31.640 --> 02:33.880]  But yeah, I thought it was really cool
[02:33.880 --> 02:38.000]  that they had that hearty, cold characteristic
[02:38.000 --> 02:39.400]  kind of in their bones.
[02:39.400 --> 02:43.320]  And then I'm always looking for that roadkill type skunk,
[02:43.320 --> 02:46.820]  those nasty fuels that I always say,
[02:48.520 --> 02:50.440]  everybody's looking for loud weed,
[02:50.440 --> 02:54.520]  but back in the day when you opened up a bag of weeds,
[02:54.520 --> 02:56.200]  if you had the good shit, the real shit,
[02:56.200 --> 02:58.760]  you really know what you're talking about.
[02:58.760 --> 03:03.080]  People from all around, the entire fucking building,
[03:03.080 --> 03:06.360]  the entire concert would really know that you showed up.
[03:06.360 --> 03:07.640]  You know what I mean?
[03:07.640 --> 03:10.560]  And these days, if you walk into a concert
[03:10.560 --> 03:15.360]  or a club or something and you open up a bag of GMO
[03:15.360 --> 03:18.920]  or any of the good shit that we have these days
[03:18.920 --> 03:21.920]  that's prevalent, maybe the people
[03:21.920 --> 03:25.080]  in your immediate vicinity kind of know that you're there,
[03:25.080 --> 03:26.840]  but you didn't light up the whole place.
[03:26.840 --> 03:27.680]  You know what I mean?
[03:27.680 --> 03:29.880]  So I'm looking for those terps
[03:29.880 --> 03:33.480]  that we kind of extinguished years ago
[03:33.480 --> 03:35.680]  because they'd get you arrested.
[03:35.680 --> 03:39.440]  And I was thinking that those ones were described
[03:39.440 --> 03:44.440]  as extremely foul, dead meat, dead animal, rotten flesh,
[03:45.440 --> 03:50.440]  skunky type tones that are just very dark and nasty.
[03:52.760 --> 03:57.760]  So I took a good little group of those
[03:58.120 --> 04:01.880]  and did an open pollination with all the males
[04:01.880 --> 04:02.720]  and all the females.
[04:02.720 --> 04:03.560]  There wasn't a ton.
[04:03.560 --> 04:06.120]  It was like, there was like four males
[04:06.120 --> 04:10.200]  and three females in the group that I had in the end.
[04:11.440 --> 04:12.840]  Pollinated them all.
[04:12.840 --> 04:15.440]  And then in the meantime, while Paul was flying,
[04:15.440 --> 04:18.440]  I threw in all the library for the most part,
[04:18.440 --> 04:23.440]  the Royal Kushes and the SFBs and the ice cream cakes
[04:23.720 --> 04:27.440]  and the PAMs and all the stuff that I had
[04:27.440 --> 04:28.760]  that was ready to go.
[04:28.760 --> 04:31.320]  And then started going through the stock, man.
[04:31.320 --> 04:36.320]  And that's where I've been playing for the last few months.
[04:36.640 --> 04:39.240]  Finally got some stuff out to Peter,
[04:39.240 --> 04:41.200]  got some stuff out to you guys.
[04:41.240 --> 04:44.080]  And we're gonna talk about it.
[04:51.670 --> 04:54.470]  I pulled a Chad Westport, everyone.
[04:54.470 --> 04:55.950]  I pulled the Chad Westport.
[04:55.950 --> 04:58.990]  I left the mute button on while I was fucking talking
[04:58.990 --> 05:01.430]  for sure pulled the Chad Westport.
[05:01.430 --> 05:03.470]  So I got a bunch of plans here too.
[05:03.470 --> 05:05.470]  Like I've got some of the stuff
[05:05.470 --> 05:07.110]  that I'm working on right now.
[05:07.110 --> 05:10.150]  I've got some of your gear here.
[05:10.150 --> 05:12.910]  I've got about six somewhere around here.
[05:12.910 --> 05:14.110]  I've got like a ton of stuff.
[05:14.110 --> 05:15.150]  So we'll talk about that.
[05:15.150 --> 05:16.310]  But I'd love to like learn a little bit
[05:16.350 --> 05:17.950]  about Corey and his system and setup
[05:17.950 --> 05:19.390]  and kind of what he's doing
[05:19.390 --> 05:21.990]  and what he's most excited about here.
[05:21.990 --> 05:22.830]  Cause I look forward to it.
[05:22.830 --> 05:24.270]  We were chatting a little bit beforehand
[05:24.270 --> 05:26.270]  cause he was super cool and showed up early.
[05:26.270 --> 05:29.990]  And we burned some conversation, which was really good.
[05:29.990 --> 05:32.230]  I'd love to hear a little bit about yourself, brother.
[05:33.190 --> 05:34.590]  Hey, how you doing?
[05:34.590 --> 05:38.750]  So yeah, no, I'm just a homegrown grower up here in Maine.
[05:39.750 --> 05:44.750]  I grow my house and this opportunity came up
[05:44.750 --> 05:46.510]  and I was like, wow, this is cool.
[05:47.830 --> 05:52.190]  I put down six seeds.
[05:52.190 --> 05:53.750]  I got five to come up.
[05:53.750 --> 05:55.830]  Everything's working great.
[05:55.830 --> 05:58.470]  Short of one day I nuked them with one of my lights.
[05:59.750 --> 06:01.390]  They've come back around.
[06:01.390 --> 06:02.550]  They're looking good.
[06:02.550 --> 06:04.510]  But no, I'm super stoked about this.
[06:04.510 --> 06:06.470]  I think this is a great idea
[06:06.470 --> 06:08.670]  and I'm super stoked to be part of it.
[06:12.010 --> 06:15.490]  What type of system are you growing in?
[06:15.490 --> 06:16.570]  I don't know if you mentioned like,
[06:16.570 --> 06:19.410]  are you like a living soil bed guy or you?
[06:19.410 --> 06:24.410]  So yeah, no, I'm running living soil, organic.
[06:26.690 --> 06:29.290]  I started a couple of four by four beds.
[06:30.490 --> 06:32.770]  I grow veg in my basement.
[06:32.770 --> 06:35.730]  I've got a couple of flower tents that I run staggered.
[06:37.130 --> 06:39.370]  But I kind of like running them.
[06:39.370 --> 06:44.370]  What I do is I'll let them grow out, clone them, sex them.
[06:44.850 --> 06:47.770]  And then I like to let them grow natural,
[06:49.010 --> 06:51.290]  see how they run, see what they look like,
[06:51.290 --> 06:53.770]  see what they do by themselves.
[06:53.770 --> 06:57.610]  And then, I like to run them scrug.
[06:57.610 --> 07:01.010]  It works well for me.
[07:01.010 --> 07:04.610]  Indoors, they just hold themselves up better,
[07:04.610 --> 07:07.090]  in my opinion, from what I've been working with.
[07:07.090 --> 07:10.010]  But yeah, no, I like to see what they look like
[07:10.010 --> 07:11.290]  just on their own.
[07:11.290 --> 07:13.370]  And now that I've heard Tyler say
[07:13.810 --> 07:16.410]  that they're cold, hot, I mean,
[07:16.410 --> 07:18.730]  I don't know what the SFV cross in it would do,
[07:18.730 --> 07:21.170]  but I did pick up the Royal from the site
[07:21.170 --> 07:23.690]  and maybe that might be a little bit of an earlier,
[07:23.690 --> 07:25.850]  I'd be willing to try that outside
[07:27.250 --> 07:30.290]  and see how that goes because why not?
[07:33.090 --> 07:35.970]  Yeah, the cool thing about the Royal
[07:35.970 --> 07:38.490]  is that's a cool work line.
[07:38.490 --> 07:42.410]  So that with the P1, the perennial stock
[07:42.410 --> 07:46.210]  from the Kandahar, that's also a work generational line,
[07:46.210 --> 07:47.050]  inbred line.
[07:47.050 --> 07:51.090]  So that's a really good representation of a true F1
[07:51.090 --> 07:54.490]  or is what you're gonna get from two sides
[07:54.490 --> 07:55.730]  that have been worked substantially.
[07:55.730 --> 07:58.490]  So the ones that are coming out with those Royals
[07:58.490 --> 08:01.210]  are really cool because it had a lot of that Royal influence
[08:01.210 --> 08:04.130]  and that Afghani influence where it's more tight
[08:04.130 --> 08:08.970]  and more short and squatty and more on the Royal type side
[08:08.970 --> 08:11.730]  where it's more leafy,
[08:12.050 --> 08:17.050]  but extremely resinous and pretty with the color.
[08:17.410 --> 08:19.610]  But because of the Royal's durability,
[08:19.610 --> 08:22.650]  with the mildew resistance and all the other things
[08:22.650 --> 08:24.450]  that it does well for the outdoors,
[08:25.450 --> 08:27.730]  that combination is killer.
[08:29.450 --> 08:31.730]  That's a killer outdoor choice.
[08:31.730 --> 08:34.690]  I'm excited about giving it a whirl, yeah, for sure.
[08:34.690 --> 08:36.010]  That's definitely gonna be your,
[08:36.010 --> 08:39.330]  you're gonna lean more to the Afghani squatty side.
[08:39.330 --> 08:43.730]  All those guys are branchy and more on that Afghani look
[08:44.690 --> 08:47.570]  in comparison to like the PAM stuff, the PAM 15,
[08:47.570 --> 08:51.170]  or even the SFV kind of stretches it out a little bit,
[08:51.170 --> 08:52.970]  makes it a little bit more branchy,
[08:52.970 --> 08:54.290]  you know what I mean, in those cases.
[08:54.290 --> 08:59.290]  But definitely retained a lot of that Afghani stackability,
[09:01.290 --> 09:05.130]  really close nodes, stuff like that.
[09:06.130 --> 09:08.530]  So are you breeding in a similar system
[09:09.410 --> 09:11.250]  to what Corey's growing?
[09:11.250 --> 09:13.650]  I have like a weird system,
[09:13.650 --> 09:16.330]  so we don't need to get into the method at it.
[09:16.330 --> 09:21.330]  I do like a mixed method system.
[09:22.210 --> 09:26.410]  So it's like, it's hard to explain.
[09:26.410 --> 09:30.330]  So I've been reusing the same cocoa,
[09:30.370 --> 09:35.370]  vermiculite, perlite mix for about a year now, roundabout.
[09:37.250 --> 09:42.250]  But I use hay and a blend of a huge variety of stuff
[09:44.330 --> 09:45.290]  for cover crop.
[09:45.290 --> 09:48.290]  And then so every time I put that in with my clones,
[09:48.290 --> 09:50.410]  when they get to about, you know,
[09:50.410 --> 09:52.250]  I don't have them set up as normally,
[09:52.250 --> 09:53.810]  I would usually have this in a three gallon.
[09:53.810 --> 09:58.010]  And then I would plant with my cover crop in there.
[09:58.010 --> 09:59.490]  And then every time I would get through,
[09:59.530 --> 10:01.650]  I would just blend it in, right?
[10:01.650 --> 10:03.010]  Through everything, carrots,
[10:03.010 --> 10:05.490]  all sorts of different herbs and everything,
[10:05.490 --> 10:08.170]  that everything possible, sage, chive,
[10:08.170 --> 10:11.170]  to fucking salad greens, to carrots,
[10:11.170 --> 10:12.650]  to fucking everything possible.
[10:12.650 --> 10:14.810]  Three gallon pot, plant in there, go.
[10:14.810 --> 10:16.890]  And the idea of being is that there was lots of spots
[10:16.890 --> 10:18.490]  for like life to be diverse,
[10:18.490 --> 10:19.890]  because I think it's like a little bit weird
[10:19.890 --> 10:22.530]  what we do to plants by putting them in places by themselves.
[10:22.530 --> 10:24.610]  It just doesn't make a lot of sense to me.
[10:24.610 --> 10:27.410]  So, and then I just blend it through every time.
[10:27.410 --> 10:29.490]  So I've actually like each round,
[10:29.490 --> 10:33.930]  I decrease my nutrient like additions by about 10%.
[10:33.930 --> 10:35.930]  And I keep adding, you know,
[10:35.930 --> 10:38.050]  humic and fulvic as a lot of carbon additive
[10:38.050 --> 10:40.410]  to like really boost the system up.
[10:40.410 --> 10:41.690]  So it's a little bit different.
[10:41.690 --> 10:44.850]  So I'm excited to see how they behave
[10:44.850 --> 10:46.530]  in that kind of methodology.
[10:46.530 --> 10:49.330]  I think we're in the same kind of climate zone though,
[10:49.330 --> 10:51.610]  as well, aren't we, Corey?
[10:51.610 --> 10:54.530]  Yeah, I would say pretty close, yep.
[10:54.530 --> 10:57.010]  And you're like, you're California there, aren't you?
[10:57.610 --> 10:59.090]  Nice and warm, I hate you a little bit right now.
[10:59.090 --> 10:59.930]  I know it's like-
[10:59.930 --> 11:02.730]  Well, on, you know, SoCal weather,
[11:02.730 --> 11:05.370]  I mean, it was 70 something today.
[11:05.370 --> 11:06.890]  I mean, it was hot, it was in the 80s today.
[11:06.890 --> 11:10.050]  So it was a hotter day for sure.
[11:10.050 --> 11:12.130]  Nights can get cold, you know, which is, you know,
[11:12.130 --> 11:15.530]  you can get down to the, you know, high 30s,
[11:15.530 --> 11:17.490]  something like that, some nights this time of year,
[11:17.490 --> 11:18.330]  you know what I mean?
[11:18.330 --> 11:20.290]  Which is not fun for the mangoes
[11:20.290 --> 11:22.250]  and some of the cannabis that's outside,
[11:22.250 --> 11:26.770]  but you know, it's SoCal.
[11:27.530 --> 11:31.850]  So, yeah, I wanted to, the way that I do things is,
[11:33.210 --> 11:36.850]  I kind of have a hard mix mash type of way to do it too,
[11:36.850 --> 11:39.970]  because I do lots of things inside and outside,
[11:39.970 --> 11:42.050]  because we can do things year round in a lot of cases,
[11:42.050 --> 11:44.050]  you can use the outside to my advantage.
[11:44.050 --> 11:46.650]  You're driving me nuts here.
[11:46.650 --> 11:48.850]  I like you, I love you.
[11:48.850 --> 11:52.770]  I love that, like, I have to make it down so badly,
[11:52.770 --> 11:55.330]  but like, I have, like, if you can,
[11:55.330 --> 11:58.170]  like here is about like a dozen mothers,
[11:59.330 --> 12:00.170]  you know what I mean?
[12:00.170 --> 12:02.330]  Like I've just crammed everything into this tiny,
[12:02.330 --> 12:04.530]  like 10 by 10 foot greenhouse
[12:04.530 --> 12:08.170]  to try and survive my winter hell, you know what I mean?
[12:08.170 --> 12:10.370]  And it is like, oh, spring's finally coming.
[12:10.370 --> 12:12.930]  I'm so fucking excited, but sorry to interrupt you.
[12:12.930 --> 12:14.530]  No, no, no, no.
[12:14.530 --> 12:16.410]  How do you heat your greenhouse out there?
[12:16.410 --> 12:17.250]  What do you do?
[12:17.250 --> 12:19.610]  You have to burn gas, you gotta-
[12:19.610 --> 12:21.010]  Yeah, a little bit of propane.
[12:21.010 --> 12:22.690]  You got soil heaters, I mean, you run water,
[12:22.690 --> 12:23.730]  what do you do?
[12:23.730 --> 12:25.770]  Propane, so I got a one propane.
[12:25.770 --> 12:27.690]  I'm in BC, Canada, so luckily,
[12:27.690 --> 12:29.770]  because of where we are and situated,
[12:29.770 --> 12:31.850]  like we don't actually get that bad.
[12:31.850 --> 12:33.890]  Like our lowest temperature was minus 12
[12:33.890 --> 12:37.690]  for like a week this year, and I managed to do fine.
[12:37.690 --> 12:39.530]  So the main challenge that I have
[12:39.530 --> 12:41.290]  is I just can't quite keep it cold enough here.
[12:41.290 --> 12:44.750]  So I run like this table that's elevated off the ground.
[12:46.050 --> 12:47.570]  I have a heat mat on underneath,
[12:47.570 --> 12:50.210]  and I'll put, you know, the three gallon pots on top,
[12:50.210 --> 12:52.810]  and that'll keep the medium well enough.
[12:52.850 --> 12:54.410]  And the mothers, you know,
[12:54.410 --> 12:57.370]  like they can take a lot of cold, you know?
[12:57.370 --> 12:58.970]  They're not too terrible.
[12:58.970 --> 13:00.650]  As long as you keep them on the regular,
[13:00.650 --> 13:02.710]  coming up, it's usually fine.
[13:04.170 --> 13:05.770]  So they usually do okay,
[13:05.770 --> 13:08.690]  but it gets a little hairy once in a while.
[13:08.690 --> 13:11.970]  I think next year I'll probably run a 22,
[13:14.010 --> 13:18.850]  255 liter jug, I guess it'd be 55 gallons,
[13:18.850 --> 13:21.810]  and run a water, round a water around the space,
[13:21.810 --> 13:23.410]  I think would be my choice next time,
[13:23.410 --> 13:25.370]  just so that my veggies do well,
[13:25.370 --> 13:28.070]  because I've gone from cold to hot so fast
[13:28.070 --> 13:30.330]  that like I've got daikon blooming,
[13:30.330 --> 13:32.970]  I've got everything's just bolted.
[13:32.970 --> 13:34.510]  So it's kind of stuck.
[13:36.410 --> 13:37.650]  Yeah, I get lucky.
[13:37.650 --> 13:39.570]  I don't have to run any heat in my greenhouses
[13:39.570 --> 13:40.770]  where I'm at, which is nice.
[13:40.770 --> 13:41.610]  You know, little hoops,
[13:41.610 --> 13:44.130]  I can seal everything up really nice.
[13:44.130 --> 13:47.490]  And if I have to, I can build a gangster
[13:47.490 --> 13:49.730]  little hot compost pile in the middle of it,
[13:49.730 --> 13:52.010]  or in the end of the little hoop,
[13:52.010 --> 13:53.970]  and that'll generate just enough heat,
[13:53.970 --> 13:55.610]  just to keep it, you know, just to keep it,
[13:55.610 --> 13:58.250]  just to kick me through those 40 degree,
[13:58.250 --> 14:00.610]  30, high 30 degree nights, you know?
[14:00.610 --> 14:02.290]  And if I got to, I can cover it up too,
[14:02.290 --> 14:04.970]  with a little bit of extra, you know,
[14:04.970 --> 14:06.570]  cloth and stuff like that,
[14:06.570 --> 14:07.970]  just to kind of get me through the night,
[14:07.970 --> 14:10.450]  but the next day it's gonna be 75 degrees.
[14:10.450 --> 14:11.290]  You know what I mean?
[14:11.290 --> 14:13.490]  So I just need to make it through a few hours,
[14:13.490 --> 14:14.530]  which is kind of nice.
[14:14.530 --> 14:16.210]  So I do lots of weird things,
[14:16.210 --> 14:19.690]  running hot water with little trenches underneath sometimes.
[14:20.650 --> 14:22.970]  I'll pour a frigging, and just get away with murder,
[14:22.970 --> 14:25.130]  cause it's, you know, it's like,
[14:25.130 --> 14:26.410]  you know, it's the perfect climate
[14:26.410 --> 14:29.250]  when it comes to, you know, temperatures usually, you know?
[14:29.250 --> 14:32.610]  And you can move plants out from inside right now,
[14:32.610 --> 14:34.130]  like start them in flower,
[14:34.130 --> 14:37.250]  and then, you know, the last two weeks or so,
[14:37.250 --> 14:38.570]  take them outside,
[14:38.570 --> 14:40.410]  and then throw them in the greenhouse outside,
[14:40.410 --> 14:42.690]  let them finish out those last two weeks outside.
[14:42.690 --> 14:45.490]  They get the UV, they get the cold,
[14:45.490 --> 14:48.930]  you'll get killer color and some sparkle on there,
[14:49.170 --> 14:51.650]  and really save some space on the inside.
[14:51.650 --> 14:53.810]  So you can move stuff in and out quicker.
[14:53.810 --> 14:54.650]  You know what I mean?
[14:54.650 --> 14:55.850]  And kind of get through, you know,
[14:55.850 --> 14:57.690]  start looking at things, start blooming things.
[14:57.690 --> 14:59.330]  You can move these guys out,
[14:59.330 --> 15:00.930]  you can finish them off outside,
[15:00.930 --> 15:02.450]  and you're kind of good and clean.
[15:02.450 --> 15:06.050]  So do a lot of shift in and moving,
[15:06.050 --> 15:07.690]  and you know, stuff like that,
[15:07.690 --> 15:10.650]  cause of the climate, you know?
[15:10.650 --> 15:12.490]  But those got the seeds,
[15:12.490 --> 15:15.370]  and that pollination with the candahars,
[15:16.290 --> 15:19.730]  they were all pollinated outside,
[15:19.730 --> 15:22.130]  and you know, in the sun for a little while,
[15:22.130 --> 15:24.130]  and then they got, you know,
[15:24.130 --> 15:26.850]  got closed in on them, they got pollinated,
[15:26.850 --> 15:29.410]  and then, you know, I finished them out that way.
[15:29.410 --> 15:33.370]  So, they were done outside,
[15:33.370 --> 15:37.290]  but all the stuff that I popped to test them
[15:37.290 --> 15:38.690]  has been done inside.
[15:38.690 --> 15:43.690]  So the initial like parentage,
[15:44.050 --> 15:45.410]  you know, was more of an inbred line.
[15:45.410 --> 15:48.530]  So the vigor on those wasn't tremendous.
[15:48.530 --> 15:50.810]  It wasn't extremely like blowing out of the pots
[15:50.810 --> 15:51.770]  and growing like crazy.
[15:51.770 --> 15:53.530]  So they took a little while to get going,
[15:53.530 --> 15:56.530]  and they were a little on the slower side.
[15:56.530 --> 16:00.170]  All the crosses got that vigor right back in action.
[16:00.170 --> 16:03.610]  So they started ripping out and popping good,
[16:03.610 --> 16:05.370]  popping early, and you know,
[16:05.370 --> 16:07.690]  really setting leaves, you know,
[16:07.690 --> 16:10.130]  fast, you know, faster pace compared to their parentage.
[16:10.130 --> 16:10.970]  So.
[16:11.130 --> 16:14.330]  These are like a week or, yeah.
[16:14.330 --> 16:16.330]  And I've been a little chilly on the last little while.
[16:16.330 --> 16:17.330]  So they've been doing really well.
[16:17.330 --> 16:19.570]  Getting a little bit leggy just because of my light
[16:19.570 --> 16:23.330]  and life, to be frank, man, you know how it is.
[16:23.330 --> 16:25.650]  Like, it's never perfect, right?
[16:25.650 --> 16:28.410]  Like, nothing in life is ever perfect.
[16:28.410 --> 16:30.170]  You do the best you can with what you have,
[16:30.170 --> 16:31.770]  and you mitigate the situations
[16:31.770 --> 16:33.170]  and problems that come forward.
[16:33.170 --> 16:35.930]  But like, these are coming out really like,
[16:35.930 --> 16:38.130]  nice broadness kind of to the leaf, right,
[16:38.170 --> 16:41.810]  at this stage in the very, kind of, earliness.
[16:41.810 --> 16:42.650]  I've got some that are a lot.
[16:42.650 --> 16:43.850]  Yeah, which ones did you get?
[16:43.850 --> 16:44.690]  Which ones did you get?
[16:44.690 --> 16:46.370]  I got the ice cream cake cross.
[16:46.370 --> 16:47.210]  Nice.
[16:47.210 --> 16:48.970]  With those, because I will own up
[16:48.970 --> 16:50.730]  so that everybody's perfectly aware
[16:50.730 --> 16:52.010]  and they can shit on me.
[16:52.010 --> 16:53.290]  There's a rule in my house, okay?
[16:53.290 --> 16:55.890]  So if I buy like a few packs of seeds,
[16:55.890 --> 16:58.930]  I usually don't, I don't ever lose anything.
[16:58.930 --> 17:02.530]  But if I ever get like a singular pack of seeds,
[17:02.530 --> 17:04.890]  it's like, it has to go in the dirt immediately,
[17:04.890 --> 17:05.730]  or they're gone.
[17:05.730 --> 17:06.770]  Like, I don't know what it is.
[17:06.770 --> 17:07.990]  My house is a fucking vacuum.
[17:08.850 --> 17:09.690]  I got two kids.
[17:09.690 --> 17:10.990]  One probably ate them.
[17:10.990 --> 17:12.950]  The other one probably, I don't know,
[17:12.950 --> 17:13.910]  put them in her diaper.
[17:13.910 --> 17:16.150]  I have no concept on where they went.
[17:16.150 --> 17:18.870]  So I wanted to just like publicly say thank you.
[17:18.870 --> 17:21.390]  And I apologize for losing your work.
[17:21.390 --> 17:23.990]  And I appreciate you replacing them.
[17:23.990 --> 17:26.070]  I got the ice cream cake.
[17:26.070 --> 17:27.950]  Yeah, so I got the ice cream cake.
[17:27.950 --> 17:28.790]  So it's a rule.
[17:28.790 --> 17:30.230]  So like the day, so I wanted,
[17:30.230 --> 17:34.430]  my goal for today was to actually to plant them with you.
[17:34.430 --> 17:36.870]  Like on the show, I thought it'd be fucking dope, right?
[17:36.870 --> 17:38.590]  But unfortunately, like, you know,
[17:38.590 --> 17:41.550]  the rule is now you have to get them in the dirt immediately
[17:41.550 --> 17:44.150]  because otherwise, I'm not gonna find them again.
[17:44.150 --> 17:46.910]  So I had to put them in the dirt right away.
[17:46.910 --> 17:50.670]  So that's why we're not planting the seeds with you today.
[17:50.670 --> 17:52.650]  But I thought it would be an interesting to kind of cover,
[17:52.650 --> 17:54.470]  like, what are your methodologies
[17:54.470 --> 17:56.010]  when it comes to germinating seeds?
[17:56.010 --> 17:58.630]  Like, what are kind of your policies
[17:58.630 --> 17:59.550]  when it comes down to it?
[17:59.550 --> 18:00.990]  Because you're in an interesting position
[18:00.990 --> 18:03.670]  that a lot of people don't get a reference to, you know,
[18:03.670 --> 18:05.870]  they often have to deal with a bank first.
[18:05.870 --> 18:09.390]  And then like, and I find it's even more challenging
[18:09.390 --> 18:12.910]  when you look at something as a point of example,
[18:12.910 --> 18:15.630]  if you take out like Ed Rosenthal's,
[18:15.630 --> 18:17.350]  the Marijuana's Grower Handbook,
[18:17.350 --> 18:22.350]  and you know, Jorge Cervantes' Cannabis Encyclopedia,
[18:23.230 --> 18:24.830]  and you put those two next to each other,
[18:24.830 --> 18:26.710]  the seed germination temperatures
[18:26.710 --> 18:27.990]  are like 10 degrees different.
[18:27.990 --> 18:32.670]  It's like Cervantes is like 24 to 32 or some shit.
[18:32.670 --> 18:36.270]  And fucking Ed Rosenthal's like, don't go above 21.
[18:36.270 --> 18:37.870]  So it's like, I find that these,
[18:37.870 --> 18:39.350]  here I'm bringing you back in there, Corey.
[18:39.350 --> 18:42.910]  I find that this is like, can vary though too.
[18:42.910 --> 18:46.410]  Because I find some seeds do great at 21 and some need 26.
[18:46.410 --> 18:48.430]  But if you go to 28, I think that's just stupid
[18:48.430 --> 18:49.430]  because something just,
[18:49.430 --> 18:51.710]  something very poor happens at that point in time.
[18:51.710 --> 18:54.150]  And I'm talking selfies, I'm so sorry for you, man.
[18:54.150 --> 18:57.070]  But you know what I mean?
[18:57.070 --> 18:59.290]  Like, what's your methodology?
[18:59.290 --> 19:00.590]  And I think that'll also help people
[19:00.590 --> 19:04.150]  that end up getting this stuff and running it themselves.
[19:04.150 --> 19:06.390]  Cause then they're gonna know how you do it.
[19:06.390 --> 19:08.110]  So I mean, could there be a better way
[19:08.110 --> 19:10.470]  of germinating your seeds than the way you do it?
[19:10.470 --> 19:11.310]  I think.
[19:11.310 --> 19:16.310]  Yeah, no, like, anytime, like, well, number one,
[19:16.590 --> 19:19.910]  like when you make seeds or you've got fresh seeds,
[19:19.910 --> 19:22.790]  just a tip for anybody who's seed making, right?
[19:22.790 --> 19:26.430]  You get your seeds, you dry your plants, you know,
[19:26.430 --> 19:28.870]  you make sure they're really good and dry.
[19:28.870 --> 19:29.910]  If you shuck your seeds,
[19:29.950 --> 19:31.430]  some people don't even shuck their seeds,
[19:31.430 --> 19:32.830]  they just keep them in the dry buds.
[19:32.830 --> 19:34.830]  It's like storage and then pack the buds away
[19:34.830 --> 19:36.950]  and then shuck them as they need them.
[19:36.950 --> 19:39.230]  Some of our old school kids do that.
[19:39.230 --> 19:42.350]  Some people will shuck them and put them away in a bag
[19:42.350 --> 19:43.910]  or a jar or whatever.
[19:43.910 --> 19:48.590]  But after your plants are dry and you shuck your seeds,
[19:48.590 --> 19:52.150]  make sure that I always leave the seeds out in open air
[19:52.150 --> 19:54.910]  for, you know, a couple of days, sometimes a week,
[19:54.910 --> 19:56.550]  sometimes, you know, 10 days,
[19:56.550 --> 19:58.710]  depends on, you know, my kids and life
[19:58.710 --> 19:59.990]  and where I'm setting them.
[19:59.990 --> 20:01.550]  But I always put them in a nice dry spot
[20:01.550 --> 20:03.630]  where I dry a lot of my other seeds
[20:03.630 --> 20:05.150]  because I collect all kinds of stuff.
[20:05.150 --> 20:08.350]  I have little shelves and a little seed drying area.
[20:08.350 --> 20:11.270]  Is it flat or like you throw them in a jar?
[20:11.270 --> 20:13.070]  No, I put them flat.
[20:13.070 --> 20:13.910]  Always flat, right?
[20:13.910 --> 20:17.190]  Or in a cup, you know, a cup or a paper bowl
[20:17.190 --> 20:18.670]  or a paper plate.
[20:18.670 --> 20:20.950]  I like using paper plates, a little wax coating,
[20:20.950 --> 20:21.790]  you know, something like that.
[20:21.790 --> 20:22.830]  I like that a lot.
[20:22.830 --> 20:25.150]  I use those all the time or a little Tupperware dish.
[20:25.150 --> 20:25.990]  You know what I mean?
[20:25.990 --> 20:28.510]  A little Tupperware, a lot of those by the time.
[20:29.310 --> 20:30.150]  But I just put them out there
[20:30.150 --> 20:31.070]  so they're not all like crammed together
[20:31.070 --> 20:32.910]  and they kind of can just get a little bit more open air,
[20:32.910 --> 20:35.270]  even though the plants were completely dry
[20:35.270 --> 20:38.110]  and, you know, everything came out perfectly.
[20:38.110 --> 20:40.550]  I always let them air dry by themselves
[20:40.550 --> 20:44.390]  for an additional, you know, few days to a week or so
[20:44.390 --> 20:47.830]  before I actually put them in a bag and seal them up.
[20:47.830 --> 20:50.870]  Once I put them in the bag and seal them up,
[20:50.870 --> 20:53.510]  I still don't like to germinate a lot of those right away
[20:53.510 --> 20:56.470]  because some strains, some things will pop right away.
[20:56.470 --> 20:58.430]  Some things will grow right inside the plant
[20:59.350 --> 21:00.190]  and be ready to go.
[21:00.190 --> 21:01.070]  Some things need a little bit of rest time.
[21:01.070 --> 21:05.030]  They need that winter period or that just rest time.
[21:05.030 --> 21:05.870]  You know what I mean?
[21:05.870 --> 21:06.710]  So to speak.
[21:06.710 --> 21:09.550]  So I find that, you know, if I pack a bunch of seeds up
[21:09.550 --> 21:11.270]  and I got a bunch, you know, drying out,
[21:11.270 --> 21:13.710]  if I try to plant a bunch of those, you know,
[21:13.710 --> 21:17.510]  you'll get 50% germination on those really early,
[21:17.510 --> 21:19.150]  fresh, super fresh seeds.
[21:19.150 --> 21:21.550]  And then you let them sit a month or two.
[21:21.550 --> 21:23.190]  And then you do that same thing.
[21:23.190 --> 21:24.710]  You do try to germinate them.
[21:24.710 --> 21:26.110]  You'll be right at a hundred percent.
[21:26.110 --> 21:26.950]  You know what I mean?
[21:26.950 --> 21:28.150]  They'll all be ready to go in a lot of cases.
[21:28.870 --> 21:29.710]  I've noticed that time and time again.
[21:29.710 --> 21:32.230]  I don't know, you know, I'm sure.
[21:32.230 --> 21:33.510]  Is that like settling in?
[21:33.510 --> 21:34.910]  They almost need that more.
[21:34.910 --> 21:38.430]  Like I'm going through hell trying to get fucking,
[21:38.430 --> 21:39.270]  where are they?
[21:39.270 --> 21:40.270]  They're like over there.
[21:40.270 --> 21:45.270]  Angelica and there's this Asian vine plant that grows.
[21:46.470 --> 21:48.670]  It's almost more like a tree,
[21:48.670 --> 21:51.190]  but you have to do like cold striation.
[21:51.190 --> 21:53.870]  So there's like, it's almost like that resting period
[21:53.870 --> 21:55.870]  for some breeds needs to happen.
[21:55.870 --> 21:57.190]  And some it's just like, it's like,
[21:57.190 --> 21:58.590]  holy fuck, get me the fuck out of here.
[21:58.590 --> 22:00.190]  I'm ready to go.
[22:00.190 --> 22:01.830]  So like you had a chip on Angelica.
[22:01.830 --> 22:02.910]  You ever planted that before?
[22:02.910 --> 22:04.350]  It sounds like you could take it.
[22:04.350 --> 22:05.190]  No, no.
[22:05.190 --> 22:06.710]  Cause I'm having damn fucking trouble.
[22:06.710 --> 22:09.710]  No, but it's like where it grows in the globe naturally,
[22:09.710 --> 22:13.430]  you know where it's from the way that winter happens.
[22:13.430 --> 22:15.150]  Like some seeds, if you put them in the fridge
[22:15.150 --> 22:16.390]  for a little while, you know what I mean?
[22:16.390 --> 22:18.350]  You get them in the fridge for a week or two,
[22:18.350 --> 22:19.670]  just give them a little cold
[22:19.670 --> 22:21.330]  and then bring them out and plant them.
[22:21.330 --> 22:23.790]  That sometimes snaps them right in, right in, right in too.
[22:23.790 --> 22:26.230]  Some things like tulips and hyacinth
[22:26.230 --> 22:28.710]  and crocus around here, we don't have enough cold.
[22:28.710 --> 22:31.510]  We got to refrigerate those for like eight to 12 weeks
[22:31.510 --> 22:32.910]  before we can plant them.
[22:32.910 --> 22:34.630]  Otherwise they don't have a winter
[22:34.630 --> 22:37.910]  and they won't come up or they won't flower.
[22:37.910 --> 22:41.670]  So everything, depending on where it's from,
[22:41.670 --> 22:44.070]  you know, on the globe and what kind of winter it deals with
[22:44.070 --> 22:48.190]  has that type of mentality that's in the seed, so to speak.
[22:48.190 --> 22:50.910]  So like equatorial strains, you know, sativa stuff,
[22:50.910 --> 22:53.110]  stuff that's like, doesn't get a lot of cold.
[22:53.110 --> 22:54.950]  Those things will pop really quick, really easy.
[22:54.950 --> 22:56.490]  Don't need a lot of rest time.
[22:56.490 --> 22:59.550]  They're usually on more of a warm cycle, you know,
[22:59.550 --> 23:01.750]  which a lot of the Pam stuff is like that
[23:01.750 --> 23:03.970]  and other things that I have are like that,
[23:03.970 --> 23:04.810]  which is pretty cool.
[23:04.810 --> 23:07.230]  And then there's other things that like I said,
[23:07.230 --> 23:09.870]  you know, need rest time or a winter time,
[23:09.870 --> 23:10.710]  you know what I mean?
[23:10.710 --> 23:14.110]  Or a little bit of a break before they start really roaring.
[23:14.110 --> 23:18.910]  So with those candahars, I let those sit out really well.
[23:18.910 --> 23:21.070]  But germination wise,
[23:21.910 --> 23:24.490]  I always take whatever I'm gonna germinate
[23:25.030 --> 23:26.610]  and I throw it in a little cup of water
[23:26.610 --> 23:30.450]  or a little bottle of water or whatever.
[23:30.450 --> 23:32.810]  And I mark on the bottle or mark on the cup what it is.
[23:32.810 --> 23:36.570]  And I let them soak for 24 hours in just regular old water,
[23:36.570 --> 23:39.070]  you know, either bottle water, tap water,
[23:39.070 --> 23:42.450]  whatever water I'm gonna typically use in its life,
[23:42.450 --> 23:43.810]  you know, for the grow.
[23:43.810 --> 23:45.490]  So if it's gonna be something that's gonna be outside,
[23:45.490 --> 23:48.090]  then you can tap water or hose water,
[23:48.090 --> 23:50.290]  or, you know, with nothing special.
[23:50.290 --> 23:52.690]  I'll start those in that type of water.
[23:52.690 --> 23:54.610]  If they're gonna be, you know, in RO water
[23:54.610 --> 23:58.530]  or, you know, filtered water, I'll use that type of water.
[23:58.530 --> 24:01.690]  But bottle water, let them soak for 24 hours.
[24:01.690 --> 24:04.510]  Then I just plant them in direct soil right away.
[24:06.090 --> 24:10.170]  So do you let them like crack and tail or you like?
[24:10.170 --> 24:12.930]  Don't, yeah, some will crack, you know,
[24:12.930 --> 24:14.770]  in that 24 hour period, you know,
[24:14.770 --> 24:16.130]  you'll see them crack open.
[24:16.130 --> 24:17.490]  Get them in there.
[24:17.490 --> 24:19.090]  And you already know, you know,
[24:19.090 --> 24:20.490]  you take a little care with those ones,
[24:20.490 --> 24:22.370]  a little extra care, because you know they're alive
[24:23.050 --> 24:25.410]  and rolling, but now after 24 hours, regardless,
[24:25.410 --> 24:27.210]  I don't want them to sit in the water too long.
[24:27.210 --> 24:29.690]  And I don't want them sunken in the water for too long,
[24:29.690 --> 24:32.490]  being, you know, under cover for too long.
[24:32.490 --> 24:35.210]  But, you know, I believe there's gotta be
[24:35.210 --> 24:37.370]  a certain amount of oxygen, certain amount of things,
[24:37.370 --> 24:40.130]  and just 24 hours in water,
[24:40.130 --> 24:42.090]  then they go in the soil as they come.
[24:42.090 --> 24:43.970]  And I'll usually plant two in a cup.
[24:43.970 --> 24:47.170]  So if I'm planting in a cup or, you know,
[24:47.170 --> 24:49.730]  or, you know, a tray or whatever,
[24:49.730 --> 24:51.150]  whatever we're putting them in,
[24:51.150 --> 24:53.870]  I'll usually put two in a, you know, two in a space.
[24:54.990 --> 24:57.430]  And if two comes up, great, I'll grow two together.
[24:57.430 --> 24:59.510]  If they're males, I grow them all together anyway,
[24:59.510 --> 25:01.350]  and we'll just, we sort them out.
[25:01.350 --> 25:02.190]  We sort them out.
[25:02.190 --> 25:03.750]  I've been debating that myself a little bit,
[25:03.750 --> 25:07.030]  is like the pop to it and see which one's the strongest.
[25:07.030 --> 25:09.150]  Cause I mean, logically, right?
[25:09.150 --> 25:11.310]  And I've always been under this theorem that like,
[25:11.310 --> 25:13.230]  if you're gonna use something for breeding
[25:13.230 --> 25:16.110]  and it's okay to really fuck that up at some times,
[25:16.110 --> 25:16.950]  you know what I mean?
[25:16.950 --> 25:18.510]  Like to make sure that it's got that stability
[25:18.510 --> 25:20.790]  and strength in there and having those challenges
[25:21.430 --> 25:22.270]  are further in there.
[25:22.270 --> 25:23.510]  So Corey, you mentioned like what,
[25:23.510 --> 25:26.210]  so how did you germinate yours?
[25:26.210 --> 25:28.270]  And then I'll go into how I kind of germinated mine,
[25:28.270 --> 25:31.550]  cause I'm gonna show how you do that, I guess.
[25:31.550 --> 25:36.430]  So basically I did straight into the soil
[25:36.430 --> 25:38.470]  and I did the tray method, like you said.
[25:39.870 --> 25:44.870]  And like I said, I had a five out of six germination,
[25:45.150 --> 25:47.670]  four out of six, like right away,
[25:47.670 --> 25:51.630]  and then one straggler and then a dud,
[25:51.630 --> 25:53.630]  but I mean, that is what it is.
[25:53.630 --> 25:56.950]  But yeah, no, so right into dirt.
[25:56.950 --> 26:00.310]  And then I work on the road plumbing,
[26:00.310 --> 26:02.630]  so I wasn't here babysitting one day
[26:02.630 --> 26:05.770]  and I scorched one of them with the light.
[26:08.710 --> 26:11.230]  Got them back, they're coming around, but yeah,
[26:14.590 --> 26:15.510]  right into the soil.
[26:15.510 --> 26:18.870]  I think I'm gonna probably do what you said
[26:18.870 --> 26:20.250]  in soak them first.
[26:22.030 --> 26:25.590]  It might've been, I don't know what it might've been,
[26:25.590 --> 26:27.950]  but I think it's a good idea to soak them.
[26:28.910 --> 26:31.790]  I used to soak them when I grew in synthetics.
[26:31.790 --> 26:32.950]  I don't know why I stopped.
[26:32.950 --> 26:35.550]  I kind of thought maybe growing in dirt,
[26:35.550 --> 26:39.210]  put them right in the dirt, but no,
[26:40.710 --> 26:43.870]  it's new to me still.
[26:43.870 --> 26:46.670]  I don't grow a lot.
[26:46.670 --> 26:49.910]  I've only started this probably three years ago.
[26:49.910 --> 26:53.690]  So no, yeah, no, right in the dirt.
[26:56.470 --> 26:58.130]  Yeah, I do lots that way,
[26:58.130 --> 27:02.230]  but I try to soak most everything these days.
[27:02.230 --> 27:04.090]  Reason being is there's a little coating
[27:04.090 --> 27:05.350]  over a lot of seeds,
[27:06.150 --> 27:09.470]  and that's like the hydrophobic coating
[27:09.470 --> 27:13.150]  to protect it from not germinating too early
[27:13.190 --> 27:14.270]  and getting screwed up
[27:14.270 --> 27:15.910]  and having an actual chance to survive.
[27:15.910 --> 27:19.310]  So by soaking it in water or getting it wet
[27:19.310 --> 27:21.190]  for a little while and making sure it stays wet,
[27:21.190 --> 27:23.870]  you can kind of break down that coating a little bit
[27:23.870 --> 27:25.150]  in my mind, I think,
[27:25.150 --> 27:26.590]  and then you can kind of throw it in the soil
[27:26.590 --> 27:27.950]  in a nice moist environment,
[27:27.950 --> 27:31.070]  it's good temperature and let them-
[27:31.070 --> 27:32.790]  If you're guaranteeing it then it gets enough
[27:32.790 --> 27:34.310]  of that water to begin with.
[27:34.310 --> 27:36.670]  I mean, it's a guarantee.
[27:36.670 --> 27:37.510]  Yep, exactly.
[27:37.510 --> 27:38.750]  You break that down a little bit,
[27:38.750 --> 27:41.050]  and that's just my thought process on that.
[27:41.090 --> 27:43.610]  So anything, anything, tomatoes,
[27:44.730 --> 27:46.890]  radishes, tree seeds, whatever,
[27:46.890 --> 27:49.310]  I always try to give them a 24 hour soak.
[27:49.310 --> 27:51.170]  And then I don't want them, like I said,
[27:51.170 --> 27:52.530]  I don't want them to be drowning.
[27:52.530 --> 27:53.370]  So I plant them right after that.
[27:53.370 --> 27:56.450]  It's fucking hard to get a tree to fucking to germinate.
[27:56.450 --> 27:58.450]  That's way harder than you think out of his teeth
[27:58.450 --> 28:00.290]  is getting a tree seed to fucking germinate, man.
[28:00.290 --> 28:02.730]  That's not a fun task.
[28:05.330 --> 28:06.450]  But it's also one of those things,
[28:06.450 --> 28:08.810]  like just put it outside, it'll be fine.
[28:08.810 --> 28:10.610]  Fuck it, just leave it alone, right?
[28:11.650 --> 28:12.490]  But I just love that.
[28:12.490 --> 28:14.130]  I'm chopping down all kinds of trees
[28:14.130 --> 28:15.410]  that grow on their own outside.
[28:15.410 --> 28:16.250]  You know what I mean?
[28:16.250 --> 28:17.370]  When you're out from the year before,
[28:17.370 --> 28:19.250]  you're like, just, oh my God, how did they do it?
[28:19.250 --> 28:21.090]  You know, it's crazy.
[28:21.090 --> 28:25.050]  I got like, we have a Sharon's bush.
[28:26.210 --> 28:27.930]  Fucking love it, because my grandmother,
[28:27.930 --> 28:30.810]  my step grandma is named Sharon.
[28:30.810 --> 28:33.210]  So the fact that this plant is named Sharon's bush
[28:33.210 --> 28:35.610]  and it's been on my parents' property for like this long,
[28:35.610 --> 28:37.490]  it's just like, oh, every time I come over,
[28:37.490 --> 28:40.490]  oh look, there's Sharon's bush, it's wonderful.
[28:41.370 --> 28:43.690]  But they're not an easy seed to germinate either.
[28:43.690 --> 28:45.930]  But I just kind of let them fall
[28:45.930 --> 28:47.610]  and then each year I'll go out
[28:47.610 --> 28:51.050]  and I'll just pick the seedlings that came out.
[28:51.050 --> 28:52.970]  They pick pretty good in the winter
[28:52.970 --> 28:54.290]  and then I'll put them down anyways.
[28:54.290 --> 28:55.970]  And I find that's the easiest way to go about it.
[28:55.970 --> 28:58.010]  I usually bring something in separately,
[28:58.010 --> 29:00.770]  it doesn't go super well, but I'm a straight and dirt guy.
[29:00.770 --> 29:03.410]  Like I fucking just like put it down.
[29:03.410 --> 29:06.410]  I do find that if I do an inert blend,
[29:06.410 --> 29:08.570]  like actually just some plain cocoa,
[29:08.610 --> 29:11.050]  vermiculite and perlite.
[29:11.050 --> 29:13.210]  And I like to put a little bit of humic
[29:13.210 --> 29:16.970]  and humic in CalMED because they use cocoa.
[29:16.970 --> 29:19.090]  But I find that works pretty well for me
[29:19.090 --> 29:21.490]  on a consistent basis.
[29:21.490 --> 29:23.130]  But I just don't like fucking around too much.
[29:23.130 --> 29:24.290]  And I got kids and it's just like,
[29:24.290 --> 29:25.730]  oh, if I put a cup somewhere,
[29:25.730 --> 29:27.210]  like imagine if I put a cup down,
[29:27.210 --> 29:29.610]  I couldn't even hold onto a pack of fucking seeds.
[29:29.610 --> 29:31.330]  So it was absolutely useless.
[29:31.330 --> 29:33.810]  Hi, did you wanna say hi real quick?
[29:33.810 --> 29:36.250]  This is my eldest.
[29:36.250 --> 29:37.090]  Hi.
[29:37.090 --> 29:37.930]  Hi.
[29:37.930 --> 29:38.770]  Hi.
[29:38.770 --> 29:39.610]  Say hi.
[29:39.610 --> 29:41.570]  I was a little sick today.
[29:41.570 --> 29:43.370]  Yeah, were you a little sick today?
[29:43.370 --> 29:44.210]  Yeah.
[29:44.210 --> 29:45.690]  Yeah.
[29:45.690 --> 29:46.530]  Feel better.
[29:46.530 --> 29:49.930]  But tomorrow I'm gonna be all better.
[29:49.930 --> 29:51.130]  Yes, you will.
[29:51.130 --> 29:52.770]  You'll be all better tomorrow.
[29:52.770 --> 29:54.010]  Thank you for coming.
[29:54.010 --> 29:54.850]  What?
[29:55.730 --> 29:57.210]  You're gonna give me a hug goodnight?
[29:57.210 --> 29:59.330]  Yeah, just give me a kiss.
[29:59.330 --> 30:00.170]  Goodnight my love.
[30:00.170 --> 30:01.010]  Okay.
[30:01.010 --> 30:03.610]  And then you and I make you sick.
[30:03.610 --> 30:04.690]  Now you're gonna make me sick
[30:04.730 --> 30:06.370]  because you gave me a kiss, right?
[30:06.370 --> 30:08.050]  That was gonna happen.
[30:08.050 --> 30:10.010]  And that's real life for you everybody.
[30:11.370 --> 30:12.850]  I appreciate your patience guys.
[30:12.850 --> 30:13.690]  I really do.
[30:13.690 --> 30:14.570]  I got three of them, man.
[30:14.570 --> 30:16.370]  I know how it goes.
[30:16.370 --> 30:17.210]  Me too.
[30:18.770 --> 30:19.650]  It's all good.
[30:19.650 --> 30:20.490]  It's great.
[30:20.490 --> 30:21.890]  It's the greatest thing in the world.
[30:23.690 --> 30:24.530]  Where were we?
[30:24.530 --> 30:26.690]  I've totally lost track of where we were.
[30:26.690 --> 30:28.370]  Yeah, so I'm just rooting stuff,
[30:28.370 --> 30:29.730]  using the dirt man.
[30:29.730 --> 30:30.730]  You're the dirt man.
[30:31.050 --> 30:31.890]  I like,
[30:35.570 --> 30:37.170]  I reuse a lot of soil.
[30:37.170 --> 30:39.490]  So if I'm buying a bag of soil for seeds
[30:39.490 --> 30:40.330]  or something like that,
[30:40.330 --> 30:41.930]  the only thing I usually ever add to it,
[30:41.930 --> 30:44.290]  I'll buy like a bag of soil,
[30:44.290 --> 30:46.210]  EB stone potting soil or,
[30:48.530 --> 30:50.210]  Royal Gold or whatever,
[30:50.210 --> 30:52.090]  whatever your flavor is.
[30:52.090 --> 30:53.810]  I don't really care too much
[30:53.810 --> 30:56.370]  whether it's peat or cocoa or whatnot,
[30:56.370 --> 30:59.130]  but I'll get a general bag of like,
[30:59.610 --> 31:02.090]  good quality organic potting soil
[31:02.090 --> 31:03.690]  and I'll add some perlite to it
[31:03.690 --> 31:05.330]  or I'll add some pumice to it.
[31:05.330 --> 31:06.170]  You know what I mean?
[31:06.170 --> 31:08.170]  Or get a sunshine pro mix or something
[31:08.170 --> 31:10.170]  and add some perlite and some worm castings.
[31:10.170 --> 31:13.290]  You know, I'm like that type of dude with mixtures.
[31:13.290 --> 31:14.970]  And then I'll reuse a lot of that.
[31:14.970 --> 31:18.330]  And I farm worms and I make compost here on the farm
[31:18.330 --> 31:21.170]  and stuff and I'm always bringing stuff
[31:21.170 --> 31:22.770]  and mixing stuff and adding stuff.
[31:22.770 --> 31:27.770]  But I'm pretty basic when it comes to like,
[31:29.890 --> 31:32.890]  seed starting material and just overall growth.
[31:32.890 --> 31:36.690]  I'll always use a lot of worms, use a lot of compost,
[31:36.690 --> 31:38.490]  use a lot of perlite and pumice,
[31:38.490 --> 31:41.570]  but really the peat and the cocoa,
[31:41.570 --> 31:44.730]  I mean, it's really whatever store I bought it at
[31:44.730 --> 31:46.090]  at whatever point I needed it.
[31:46.090 --> 31:46.930]  You know what I mean?
[31:46.930 --> 31:48.490]  And then it all goes into the garden anyway
[31:48.490 --> 31:49.330]  when I'm done with it
[31:49.330 --> 31:51.850]  and I'm not using it for stuff anymore.
[31:51.850 --> 31:54.490]  And it's actually like, it goes out to the orchard,
[31:54.490 --> 31:55.730]  it goes to the compost pile,
[31:55.730 --> 31:57.130]  it goes into the worm bin anyway.
[31:57.130 --> 31:57.970]  You know what I mean?
[31:57.970 --> 32:01.530]  So that's kind of how I deal with a lot of that stuff.
[32:01.530 --> 32:02.570]  It's a complete closed loop.
[32:02.570 --> 32:04.890]  So anything I buy always ends up, you know,
[32:04.890 --> 32:06.010]  in the circle somewhere,
[32:06.010 --> 32:08.250]  it just gets thrown into the mix, you know?
[32:08.250 --> 32:09.090]  So.
[32:10.250 --> 32:11.290]  This is awesome.
[32:11.290 --> 32:12.130]  Fucking awesome.
[32:14.370 --> 32:17.570]  I have been trying to figure out how to get worms
[32:17.570 --> 32:20.730]  to survive a whole flower cycle in a three gallon pot
[32:20.730 --> 32:23.450]  with cover crop and a full flowering plant.
[32:23.450 --> 32:24.650]  Easy task, man.
[32:24.650 --> 32:26.410]  No, it's not.
[32:26.410 --> 32:28.650]  They were dead last time, I'll tell you what.
[32:28.650 --> 32:30.770]  There was no worms in there,
[32:30.770 --> 32:35.770]  but I did manage to get a pot to pretty much root bound
[32:35.850 --> 32:40.650]  with, and have a worm survive in a one gallon,
[32:40.650 --> 32:42.890]  but that wasn't for nearly the length of time
[32:42.890 --> 32:44.330]  that the flowering plants were.
[32:44.330 --> 32:46.810]  So we're working on it still.
[32:46.810 --> 32:48.090]  I don't know if I'm ever gonna get there,
[32:48.090 --> 32:49.130]  but I'm gonna try.
[32:49.130 --> 32:50.970]  That's for sure.
[32:51.970 --> 32:56.210]  Yeah, I can't, I don't, you know, sometimes, you know,
[32:56.210 --> 32:58.650]  sometimes if there's a worm in the soil, that's great.
[32:58.650 --> 33:02.090]  Cause I have worm castings and everything's made.
[33:02.090 --> 33:04.370]  So there's sometimes there'll be worms that'll pop up
[33:04.370 --> 33:05.210]  and do their thing.
[33:05.210 --> 33:06.890]  But unless it's in like the beds
[33:06.890 --> 33:09.690]  where I'm running the beds with the cover,
[33:09.690 --> 33:10.690]  I mean, that's the only time
[33:10.690 --> 33:12.730]  that I'll ever have worms hang out and stay.
[33:12.730 --> 33:13.570]  You know what I mean?
[33:13.570 --> 33:15.650]  For the long term, you know, for sure.
[33:15.650 --> 33:17.370]  But, you know, it's cool here
[33:17.410 --> 33:21.290]  cause I can farm worms right outside and all year round
[33:21.290 --> 33:23.170]  and they never get too cold.
[33:23.170 --> 33:25.330]  And they just kind of just keep working all the time.
[33:25.330 --> 33:26.170]  You know what I mean?
[33:26.170 --> 33:27.410]  And some of the colder nights,
[33:27.410 --> 33:30.810]  I can just throw a blanket over them and they're cool.
[33:30.810 --> 33:32.330]  They're just super easy.
[33:32.330 --> 33:37.330]  So I got like, you know, 10 or 12 giant little
[33:37.610 --> 33:39.690]  homemade worm bins, you know what I mean?
[33:39.690 --> 33:41.970]  That I feed and we can pull out worm castings
[33:41.970 --> 33:43.650]  and worm stuff all the time.
[33:43.650 --> 33:45.650]  And I'm always, lately I've been taking
[33:45.850 --> 33:49.970]  those like a five gallon bucket
[33:49.970 --> 33:52.490]  and drilling holes in the bottom of the bucket
[33:52.490 --> 33:56.210]  and taking some of that already started worm material
[33:56.210 --> 33:58.450]  from my worm beds, you know, with some worms
[33:58.450 --> 34:01.410]  and, you know, the manure and some of the vegetable scraps.
[34:01.410 --> 34:04.370]  And then I bury it in the ground next to a tree
[34:04.370 --> 34:07.250]  or in a group of trees.
[34:07.250 --> 34:10.730]  And then I cover it up just like I would a regular worm bed.
[34:10.730 --> 34:14.610]  And that kind of constantly just leeches worm stuff
[34:14.610 --> 34:16.650]  right into that little tree zone
[34:16.650 --> 34:19.090]  and I can feed it and steal some worm stuff out of there.
[34:19.090 --> 34:22.330]  I've been doing that a lot lately as, you know,
[34:22.330 --> 34:23.490]  cool little testing sites.
[34:23.490 --> 34:24.930]  I'm gonna see how good that works, you know,
[34:24.930 --> 34:28.490]  but I've gone worm crazy in a weird way outside,
[34:28.490 --> 34:31.490]  you know, inside, you know, if a worm ends up in the pot.
[34:31.490 --> 34:32.330]  You know, that's-
[34:32.330 --> 34:36.010]  What's the name of the weird worm people?
[34:36.010 --> 34:38.450]  I mean, I don't mean it offensively anyway.
[34:38.450 --> 34:40.930]  I have the most respect for the weird worm people,
[34:40.970 --> 34:44.370]  but there's like a vermin, vermo, vermo, vermo.
[34:46.450 --> 34:47.290]  Yeah, like-
[34:47.290 --> 34:48.450]  I've forgotten it.
[34:48.450 --> 34:50.850]  You know what I'm talking about, right?
[34:50.850 --> 34:52.130]  But there's like a-
[34:52.130 --> 34:53.850]  Vermicologist?
[34:53.850 --> 34:56.650]  Like, no, but it's like, it's like less formal.
[34:56.650 --> 35:00.010]  I've fucking, there was a, Peter had the,
[35:00.010 --> 35:04.250]  one of the, I guess the disciples of the worm lady
[35:04.250 --> 35:07.050]  that did the worm video that's super educational.
[35:07.050 --> 35:10.330]  But like she said it and I forget what the word is.
[35:10.770 --> 35:13.010]  Yeah, I thought it was like super hilarious.
[35:13.010 --> 35:13.970]  I am super-
[35:13.970 --> 35:16.490]  There's all those little funny little forks of things,
[35:16.490 --> 35:18.450]  you know, and all the little specialties and stuff.
[35:18.450 --> 35:21.450]  It's really cool that, you know, we have such, you know,
[35:21.450 --> 35:24.730]  such a depth and such a killer little thing like worms,
[35:24.730 --> 35:27.770]  which is such a huge thing, you know, it's cool.
[35:27.770 --> 35:30.450]  So, do you have some of these down?
[35:30.450 --> 35:31.930]  I'm assuming you do,
[35:31.930 --> 35:35.250]  but do you have like a volume of these down for the season
[35:35.250 --> 35:38.330]  that you're excited to dip into
[35:38.330 --> 35:41.050]  as one of them been like a really shining bright
[35:41.050 --> 35:44.210]  and you're like that guy that's performing nicely?
[35:44.210 --> 35:45.050]  Or-
[35:45.050 --> 35:49.050]  Yeah, so, yeah, I have a cool thing about me is that,
[35:49.050 --> 35:52.290]  you know, I do fruit trees all over the place,
[35:52.290 --> 35:53.330]  all over in SoCal.
[35:53.330 --> 35:55.810]  So there's all kinds of different orchards and places
[35:55.810 --> 35:57.170]  and sites that I go.
[35:57.170 --> 35:59.530]  And a lot of the sites that I go,
[35:59.530 --> 36:01.210]  a lot of the people are really cool
[36:01.210 --> 36:03.610]  and they wanna grow their own cannabis too.
[36:03.610 --> 36:08.330]  So everybody at all the sites get cannabis seeds
[36:08.330 --> 36:10.090]  whenever I get new stuff.
[36:10.090 --> 36:12.130]  And then I get to travel around, you know,
[36:12.130 --> 36:14.210]  throughout the months and I can come
[36:14.210 --> 36:15.490]  and I can take a look at stuff
[36:15.490 --> 36:17.090]  and see how they performed at the place.
[36:17.090 --> 36:18.810]  And I can look at them sight unseen.
[36:18.810 --> 36:21.690]  I can take cuts of them if I need to.
[36:21.690 --> 36:23.210]  I get reports on them
[36:23.210 --> 36:25.090]  and then I can actually see them flowered out
[36:25.090 --> 36:27.010]  and taste some stuff if I wanted to take some,
[36:27.010 --> 36:29.210]  it's all, cause I take care of a lot of the stuff,
[36:29.210 --> 36:30.610]  you know, that's there, which is kind of cool.
[36:30.610 --> 36:33.530]  So we've been running through, you know,
[36:34.330 --> 36:37.170]  we've been looking at a lot over, you know,
[36:37.170 --> 36:39.090]  everybody's, you know, everybody's places.
[36:39.090 --> 36:43.530]  We just, you know, six at a time, you know,
[36:43.530 --> 36:46.370]  10 at a time at different places, looking at them all.
[36:46.370 --> 36:50.050]  And I get to see that on a scale on a bunch of those.
[36:50.050 --> 36:52.970]  So I've looked at, you know, several hundred of them.
[36:54.330 --> 36:56.530]  The Royal Kush in particular,
[36:56.530 --> 36:59.570]  Canada Heart Royal Kush, the Ice Cream Cake.
[36:59.570 --> 37:02.530]  I looked at a bunch where it's still got some
[37:02.570 --> 37:04.290]  coming into flower with the Ice Cream Cake,
[37:04.290 --> 37:05.610]  which I'm really stoked.
[37:05.610 --> 37:07.610]  I'm gonna start throwing some pictures up pretty soon
[37:07.610 --> 37:10.210]  cause they're just now starting to get really nice.
[37:10.210 --> 37:15.130]  And the PAM 15, I got through as well.
[37:15.130 --> 37:17.370]  Canada Heart and that, that's fucking cool.
[37:17.370 --> 37:20.770]  That's, you know, that one actually with the PAM 15
[37:20.770 --> 37:22.130]  and the Canada Heart,
[37:22.130 --> 37:27.130]  PAM 15 is a really tough, hazy, sativa type growing plant.
[37:28.130 --> 37:32.690]  It's extreme vigor, extreme branching.
[37:32.690 --> 37:35.610]  It's a killer, it's a killer plant.
[37:35.610 --> 37:38.850]  I like it more than PAM 1, like for smoke wise,
[37:38.850 --> 37:40.770]  but for like throwing it in the tent wise,
[37:40.770 --> 37:43.850]  it's like the most just untamable beast.
[37:43.850 --> 37:44.690]  You know what I mean?
[37:44.690 --> 37:47.250]  It just grows super fast and just goes everywhere.
[37:47.250 --> 37:50.050]  And it's just like, it's just a, just a bad-ass.
[37:50.050 --> 37:50.890]  So that-
[37:50.890 --> 37:52.090]  Love it, but hate it.
[37:52.090 --> 37:53.490]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[37:53.490 --> 37:54.850]  But the smoke is killer, man.
[37:54.850 --> 37:55.890]  It's fucking awesome.
[37:56.090 --> 37:59.570]  But that combined with the Canada Hearts,
[37:59.570 --> 38:03.610]  cause those are more, more stout, more slow,
[38:03.610 --> 38:05.890]  you know, less, less branching to that.
[38:05.890 --> 38:08.450]  They had a killer little, little medium.
[38:08.450 --> 38:11.090]  It really kind of honed in the PAM,
[38:11.090 --> 38:13.570]  but still didn't lose, you know,
[38:13.570 --> 38:16.210]  the branching capabilities and, you know,
[38:16.210 --> 38:18.250]  the space that gave it a little bit more space
[38:18.250 --> 38:20.410]  and breath, more OG like.
[38:20.410 --> 38:23.930]  I like the sound of that for, I bet you for Maine too,
[38:23.930 --> 38:25.930]  that would make you pretty happy as well, right?
[38:25.930 --> 38:28.730]  That, I need a little bit of that extra room
[38:28.730 --> 38:30.610]  with just the way life is.
[38:30.610 --> 38:32.850]  I mean, when you're running 100% humidity,
[38:32.850 --> 38:35.930]  pulling out outdoor air for like three months,
[38:35.930 --> 38:38.690]  fucking straight, it really helps having a little bit
[38:38.690 --> 38:40.450]  of extra room in those nodes.
[38:40.450 --> 38:42.850]  Drip some air through there, man, for sure.
[38:42.850 --> 38:45.770]  Yeah, they had the, and it had more of the PAM 15,
[38:45.770 --> 38:47.490]  like pine cone stacking habit,
[38:47.490 --> 38:49.410]  where it was just like pine cone, pine cone,
[38:49.410 --> 38:50.930]  pine cone, pine cone, pine cone.
[38:50.930 --> 38:51.770]  You know what I mean?
[38:51.970 --> 38:54.530]  You know, they grow just about to touch,
[38:54.530 --> 38:56.010]  but not, you know, not touching.
[38:56.010 --> 39:00.650]  Everything else was more, more squat,
[39:00.650 --> 39:03.250]  more indica, you know, type, you know, in frame.
[39:03.250 --> 39:04.930]  That PAM 15 really opened her up.
[39:04.930 --> 39:06.970]  And the SFB too, it did a good job
[39:06.970 --> 39:08.610]  of opening it up a little bit.
[39:08.610 --> 39:09.530]  Nice.
[39:09.530 --> 39:13.370]  But yeah, I'm excited to see some of those SFBs.
[39:13.370 --> 39:15.090]  There's some that are going into depth
[39:15.090 --> 39:16.330]  over at my buddy's house.
[39:16.330 --> 39:19.170]  And I got some that I started in, you know, here
[39:19.170 --> 39:21.210]  that I'm gonna run inside.
[39:21.210 --> 39:22.770]  They're getting ready to get flipped in,
[39:22.770 --> 39:25.970]  into flower here in the next couple of days,
[39:25.970 --> 39:26.970]  or maybe a week.
[39:28.330 --> 39:29.930]  But I'm excited for those.
[39:29.930 --> 39:33.050]  They had the, those in the PAM 15,
[39:33.970 --> 39:36.650]  a few of the phenos, especially the PAM 15,
[39:36.650 --> 39:39.110]  because it's really prominent in those.
[39:39.110 --> 39:44.110]  You break off the, like a fan leaf on, you know,
[39:44.250 --> 39:48.530]  a big major fan leaf, water leaf or whatever,
[39:48.530 --> 39:51.770]  in a good spot, like about midway or up top, you know,
[39:51.770 --> 39:53.450]  more if you go too far, it won't happen.
[39:53.450 --> 39:56.450]  But it's like midway to top, you break off that leaf
[39:56.450 --> 39:58.730]  and you smell the, smell the chlorophyll,
[39:58.730 --> 39:59.950]  the blood that comes out of there.
[39:59.950 --> 40:03.210]  It's the most pungent, like you opened up a jar of like-
[40:03.210 --> 40:04.370]  I've never done that technique.
[40:04.370 --> 40:05.530]  I now have to do this now.
[40:05.530 --> 40:10.530]  Or pepperoncinis, or it's like this funky,
[40:11.370 --> 40:15.290]  spicy, sour, extremely pungent smell
[40:15.290 --> 40:16.130]  that comes out of there.
[40:16.130 --> 40:17.690]  And it's like, it makes you want to kind of taste it.
[40:17.690 --> 40:20.570]  And it's like, it's really delicious, but PAM 15 does that.
[40:20.570 --> 40:22.290]  That's one of the reasons I selected her.
[40:22.290 --> 40:25.290]  But a couple of the phenos on the SFVs
[40:25.290 --> 40:27.490]  and the PAM 15 crosses,
[40:27.490 --> 40:29.010]  I was breaking off some of those leaves
[40:29.010 --> 40:31.890]  and they had some similar traits like that, which is cool.
[40:31.890 --> 40:33.010]  And I always liked those plants.
[40:33.010 --> 40:34.650]  I always liked to tag those plants a little bit
[40:34.650 --> 40:37.010]  and just kind of watch those a little closer.
[40:37.010 --> 40:37.990]  Not everything does it.
[40:37.990 --> 40:39.810]  Some stuff just smells just like a plant.
[40:39.810 --> 40:41.450]  Most stuff does anyway, you know,
[40:41.450 --> 40:43.890]  or you'll get a little something,
[40:43.890 --> 40:46.330]  but when you break it off, you know it, you know,
[40:46.330 --> 40:48.550]  when they're healthy and you got it going on,
[40:48.550 --> 40:50.410]  it really, really lights you up, you know,
[40:50.410 --> 40:51.250]  it's pretty cool.
[40:51.250 --> 40:52.070]  Too cool.
[40:52.070 --> 40:52.910]  That's neat.
[40:52.910 --> 40:54.690]  I've got a couple that are like that,
[40:54.690 --> 40:57.930]  where you like, you put them in anywhere you put them.
[40:57.930 --> 40:59.810]  It's just like, they just start ranking
[40:59.810 --> 41:01.010]  and being really sticky.
[41:01.010 --> 41:04.050]  You rub them with your hands, even at any point in time.
[41:04.050 --> 41:05.450]  It's just like, they just stink
[41:05.450 --> 41:06.730]  and they don't need to be in flowering.
[41:06.730 --> 41:08.810]  They don't need to be anywhere, but they have.
[41:08.810 --> 41:10.370]  And I've heard that term before.
[41:10.370 --> 41:11.930]  And is that something that you look for?
[41:11.930 --> 41:14.370]  Because I've heard this before from another,
[41:14.370 --> 41:16.270]  like guy that's been doing it for a while.
[41:17.210 --> 41:19.550]  And he said, one of the best pieces of advice he got
[41:19.550 --> 41:23.350]  was like, if you find a plant that smells like cheeseburgers
[41:23.350 --> 41:26.750]  that shit will like always fucking be bomb
[41:26.750 --> 41:28.150]  every fucking time.
[41:28.150 --> 41:29.630]  There's something about it.
[41:30.470 --> 41:32.910]  And then I start hearing about Joy Burger.
[41:32.910 --> 41:35.270]  I'm like, there's gotta be something to this.
[41:35.270 --> 41:36.110]  That's funny.
[41:36.110 --> 41:38.190]  And then you say dill pickles.
[41:38.190 --> 41:39.630]  I'm like, ah, maybe there's something.
[41:39.630 --> 41:41.030]  Yeah, no, you know, it's like,
[41:41.030 --> 41:43.710]  I always look for those plants that smell a lot
[41:43.710 --> 41:45.390]  in vegetative state, I like that.
[41:45.390 --> 41:49.750]  But, you know, it's like the PAM 15 smells in beds
[41:49.750 --> 41:51.230]  kind of skunky and kind of musty
[41:51.230 --> 41:53.430]  and will light up a room just by sitting there.
[41:53.430 --> 41:54.430]  But when you break the leaf
[41:54.430 --> 41:56.070]  and you actually smell the blood,
[41:56.070 --> 41:57.430]  it's like, it's a whole nother,
[41:57.430 --> 41:59.190]  like it's a whole nother level.
[41:59.190 --> 42:01.390]  It's like a weird, it's a crazy punch.
[42:01.390 --> 42:02.830]  And it doesn't last very long either.
[42:02.830 --> 42:04.030]  It's kind of like this little thing.
[42:04.030 --> 42:05.190]  It's like a fart in the wind.
[42:05.190 --> 42:06.030]  You know what I mean?
[42:06.030 --> 42:07.110]  It just goes away.
[42:07.110 --> 42:09.390]  And you can't really get it to come back out again.
[42:09.390 --> 42:10.230]  You know what I mean?
[42:10.230 --> 42:12.190]  You gotta do it quick, you know?
[42:12.190 --> 42:14.230]  But I don't know, I'm weird like that,
[42:14.230 --> 42:15.910]  but I'm always breaking stuff off
[42:15.910 --> 42:17.350]  and showing my friends and stuff, you know,
[42:17.350 --> 42:18.190]  like, hey, check that out.
[42:18.190 --> 42:20.270]  You know, like, whoa, it's pretty cool.
[42:20.270 --> 42:21.910]  It's interesting, you know?
[42:21.910 --> 42:25.150]  I fucking, like every one of your metaphors
[42:25.150 --> 42:28.310]  and analogies were just so like awesome.
[42:28.310 --> 42:31.110]  I just, I'm still just like dealing
[42:31.110 --> 42:32.470]  with that a little bit, man.
[42:32.470 --> 42:34.950]  Cause I like, I could have interrupted you four times.
[42:34.950 --> 42:37.550]  The fart in the wind thing just blew my fucking mind.
[42:39.110 --> 42:41.430]  Absolutely appreciate the shit out of that.
[42:41.430 --> 42:43.070]  It's that touching of plants.
[42:43.190 --> 42:45.390]  People get fearful and it's like,
[42:45.390 --> 42:47.710]  I'm an experiential person.
[42:47.710 --> 42:49.910]  Like if I gotta live in this world,
[42:49.910 --> 42:51.910]  I gotta do as much as I can.
[42:51.910 --> 42:55.190]  You know, like how do I experience as many plants as I can?
[42:55.190 --> 42:57.350]  And how do I dig into something as much as,
[42:57.350 --> 42:58.950]  I only got like so many years, right?
[42:58.950 --> 43:00.110]  Like a fucking, who knows?
[43:00.110 --> 43:02.230]  And who knows how many of that?
[43:02.230 --> 43:04.150]  And like, then you hear these breeders talk,
[43:04.150 --> 43:06.870]  like Ryan Lee was on Breed Around Tables the other day.
[43:06.870 --> 43:09.870]  He talked about like how he's doing a breeding project
[43:09.870 --> 43:12.590]  and he'll probably not see the end of it.
[43:13.670 --> 43:17.110]  Ever, you know, like that's fucking,
[43:17.110 --> 43:18.950]  like I gotta get to work.
[43:18.950 --> 43:21.790]  Like I feel like I've been lazy for a while, man.
[43:21.790 --> 43:23.830]  And I've been an ambitious motherfucker.
[43:23.830 --> 43:25.150]  I'm not gonna lie.
[43:25.150 --> 43:26.790]  Yeah, it's hard, man.
[43:26.790 --> 43:27.630]  It's hard.
[43:27.630 --> 43:29.430]  Like even like where I live a lot,
[43:29.430 --> 43:31.910]  like in the fruit tree world, you know,
[43:31.910 --> 43:33.430]  trees take years, man.
[43:33.430 --> 43:36.070]  So, you know, stuff that you do today,
[43:36.070 --> 43:37.430]  whether you're grafting something
[43:37.430 --> 43:38.830]  or you're planting something from a seed
[43:38.830 --> 43:40.270]  or you're breeding something, shit, dude.
[43:41.030 --> 43:45.590]  You're looking at a 30 year process, you know, 20 years.
[43:45.590 --> 43:48.110]  Maybe you get lucky and you do some weird stuff,
[43:48.110 --> 43:50.190]  like you bend the trunk and you harm the tree
[43:50.190 --> 43:52.190]  at a young age to get it to fruit earlier.
[43:52.190 --> 43:54.350]  You do weird stuff like that to see,
[43:54.350 --> 43:56.270]  see different characteristics a little sooner,
[43:56.270 --> 44:00.590]  but you're still looking at like seven to 15 years
[44:00.590 --> 44:03.230]  before you see anything of value off of a tree.
[44:03.230 --> 44:04.070]  You know what I mean?
[44:04.070 --> 44:07.270]  So, you know, I mean, think, you know, that's a,
[44:07.270 --> 44:08.990]  and you might throw it away anyway.
[44:08.990 --> 44:09.830]  You know what I mean?
[44:10.390 --> 44:12.230]  And after seven, you know, it's like, holy shit,
[44:12.230 --> 44:13.270]  you know, so it's like that's like-
[44:13.270 --> 44:15.190]  Forget you even did anything.
[44:15.190 --> 44:17.910]  You know, but it's hard to grow the same stuff.
[44:17.910 --> 44:20.270]  Like, you know, when there's so many cool things out there
[44:20.270 --> 44:21.910]  and new things that are coming around the corner,
[44:21.910 --> 44:23.670]  it's like, man, should I take,
[44:23.670 --> 44:25.350]  should I take the PAM to F5
[44:25.350 --> 44:27.270]  or should I grow some completely new shit
[44:27.270 --> 44:28.350]  that I never smoked before?
[44:28.350 --> 44:29.190]  You know what I mean?
[44:29.190 --> 44:30.030]  And it's like, it's hard.
[44:30.030 --> 44:31.510]  Let's do both, let's do both.
[44:31.510 --> 44:32.350]  Yeah, you know, it's like-
[44:32.350 --> 44:34.070]  And then it's like, wow,
[44:34.070 --> 44:35.990]  I've made some poor decisions this year.
[44:36.030 --> 44:39.870]  I like, I got way too much work ahead of me
[44:39.870 --> 44:41.390]  and I only got two hands
[44:41.390 --> 44:43.350]  and I'm pretty sure this one's gonna go limp
[44:43.350 --> 44:44.870]  halfway through, I don't know.
[44:46.630 --> 44:48.630]  And that's the eternal, you know, thing.
[44:48.630 --> 44:49.590]  That's why I think, you know,
[44:49.590 --> 44:51.310]  that's why a lot of those breeding projects
[44:51.310 --> 44:52.310]  just kind of fizzle out
[44:52.310 --> 44:56.030]  because most people's attention span isn't that long,
[44:56.030 --> 44:57.510]  you know, and there's so many cool new things
[44:57.510 --> 45:00.030]  that'll pop along and change and do their stuff.
[45:00.030 --> 45:03.590]  So it's, you gotta really wanna do something, you know,
[45:03.590 --> 45:06.150]  if you're gonna do something long-term, you know,
[45:06.150 --> 45:07.870]  trying to, it's hard.
[45:07.870 --> 45:11.110]  But yeah, I don't think any of our projects will be done,
[45:11.110 --> 45:12.910]  you know, by the time our time is done,
[45:12.910 --> 45:13.950]  you know what I mean?
[45:13.950 --> 45:17.230]  Yes, that's life though, right?
[45:17.230 --> 45:20.310]  Like, you always just kind of wanna leave something
[45:20.310 --> 45:21.350]  that keeps going.
[45:21.350 --> 45:22.990]  There's no end to a project.
[45:22.990 --> 45:25.190]  And I love that part of cannabis.
[45:25.190 --> 45:26.310]  So I gotta ask, like,
[45:26.310 --> 45:27.870]  and I'm sure Corey probably feels the same,
[45:27.870 --> 45:29.310]  it's like, did you like,
[45:30.150 --> 45:33.190]  did the trees find the cannabis
[45:33.190 --> 45:35.630]  or did the cannabis find the trees?
[45:35.630 --> 45:36.470]  You know what I mean?
[45:36.470 --> 45:39.630]  Like, like,
[45:39.630 --> 45:42.470]  because I was, I love plants and food.
[45:42.470 --> 45:44.790]  And I started going to like, as a chef,
[45:44.790 --> 45:48.790]  I started going to farms and organic suppliers
[45:48.790 --> 45:49.990]  and meeting all these people.
[45:49.990 --> 45:53.950]  And like, I was running and managing the purchasing
[45:53.950 --> 45:56.550]  for like a very large, well-off steakhouse.
[45:56.550 --> 45:59.950]  So I got to meet all these fantastic fucking human beings
[45:59.950 --> 46:02.550]  and like really fucking great people.
[46:02.550 --> 46:03.390]  So when I talk to you,
[46:03.390 --> 46:05.110]  I like instantly relate to those people.
[46:05.110 --> 46:06.630]  Like, I just love, I can love it.
[46:06.630 --> 46:07.470]  Cause they're just like,
[46:07.470 --> 46:09.430]  they just care about everything that they're doing.
[46:09.430 --> 46:11.830]  And they're not doing it for any other reason
[46:11.830 --> 46:14.310]  other than the passion and joy of taking part of it.
[46:14.310 --> 46:15.230]  Fucking love it.
[46:15.230 --> 46:17.310]  Inspirational as fuck.
[46:17.310 --> 46:20.110]  I just kept on getting bigger, digging deeper into it.
[46:20.110 --> 46:22.270]  So I wonder like, what's the story?
[46:22.270 --> 46:23.830]  What's yours?
[46:23.830 --> 46:25.110]  So, you know,
[46:26.630 --> 46:29.230]  I've always like spoken to the trees in a weird way.
[46:29.230 --> 46:30.070]  You know what I mean?
[46:30.070 --> 46:31.670]  I've always like been interested in trees.
[46:31.670 --> 46:35.470]  I always like, you know, wanted to know more about trees.
[46:35.470 --> 46:39.070]  I used to ditch class in like seventh and eighth grade
[46:39.070 --> 46:42.430]  and go to the library and read about fruit trees
[46:42.430 --> 46:44.590]  and look at the old encyclopedia Britannica's
[46:44.590 --> 46:47.510]  about grafting and weird stuff like that when I was a kid.
[46:48.990 --> 46:52.470]  But when I started with cannabis around that same time,
[46:52.470 --> 46:56.430]  you know, that like,
[46:56.430 --> 46:58.390]  that really solidified the plant world.
[46:58.390 --> 46:59.230]  You know what I mean?
[46:59.230 --> 47:01.230]  Like, it's like, man, I've always loved these trees.
[47:01.230 --> 47:03.750]  I'm always wanted to have a little, you know,
[47:03.750 --> 47:05.030]  bunch of my own fruit trees.
[47:05.030 --> 47:07.470]  My grandpa was a farmer.
[47:07.470 --> 47:09.870]  My grandpa on the other side was a farmer.
[47:09.870 --> 47:10.710]  You know what I mean?
[47:10.710 --> 47:12.870]  People, you know, plants and stuff were in my blood.
[47:12.870 --> 47:16.350]  So, you know, the trees definitely
[47:17.690 --> 47:19.290]  came at about the same time,
[47:19.290 --> 47:22.850]  but because of cannabis made me wanna grow trees
[47:22.850 --> 47:26.450]  in a more holistic manner and like taught me more about
[47:26.450 --> 47:28.690]  how to take better care of like myself
[47:28.690 --> 47:30.990]  and the planet and other things.
[47:30.990 --> 47:34.770]  It took me deeper because I was consuming it
[47:34.770 --> 47:35.610]  in a different way, you know?
[47:35.610 --> 47:37.290]  And I always do it's like, man,
[47:37.290 --> 47:39.290]  I'd see what my buddies would put on it
[47:39.290 --> 47:41.050]  when we started really growing with our kids
[47:41.050 --> 47:42.090]  and the stuff that we had.
[47:42.090 --> 47:44.610]  And I was a farmer and I was used to seeing
[47:44.610 --> 47:47.530]  different labels and I heard different things.
[47:47.570 --> 47:49.330]  And I'd read a lot of books on that stuff.
[47:49.330 --> 47:52.610]  And I just smoking cannabis made me wanna do it
[47:52.610 --> 47:55.410]  a little bit, you know, do everything a little bit more,
[47:56.330 --> 47:57.470]  more friendly.
[47:57.470 --> 48:00.650]  And, you know, that's kind of where it took me to,
[48:00.650 --> 48:03.610]  you know, as soon as we got the jobs,
[48:03.610 --> 48:05.650]  the fruit tree world, just starting to learn
[48:05.650 --> 48:07.370]  and I apprenticed with a lot of people
[48:07.370 --> 48:10.250]  and I just tried to learn as much as I could about that.
[48:10.250 --> 48:14.090]  And then how to preserve this place and cannabis,
[48:14.090 --> 48:15.690]  it just keeps me motivated.
[48:15.690 --> 48:18.330]  And it's something that I can do in a short period of time,
[48:18.330 --> 48:20.890]  like breeding wise, like, because like I said before,
[48:20.890 --> 48:24.170]  it takes years to do plants like trees and stuff like that.
[48:24.170 --> 48:27.890]  And I breed, you know, I mix pollen with mango trees
[48:27.890 --> 48:30.330]  and apple trees and all kinds of stuff.
[48:30.330 --> 48:31.930]  And I've got thousands of seedlings
[48:31.930 --> 48:33.730]  of all kinds of stuff, you know what I mean?
[48:33.730 --> 48:35.050]  That who knows if I'm gonna see fruit
[48:35.050 --> 48:37.370]  on some of this stuff, some of the stuff I get close,
[48:37.370 --> 48:39.650]  other, but you know, that's taken a long time,
[48:39.650 --> 48:41.970]  but I can make a whole bunch of different types of cannabis
[48:41.970 --> 48:43.730]  that I love smoking too.
[48:43.730 --> 48:47.290]  And then finding the Pam and, you know,
[48:47.290 --> 48:48.650]  having something that was a little bit different
[48:48.650 --> 48:50.930]  and a little funky and just, that just kind of just,
[48:50.930 --> 48:53.930]  evolution just kept taking me a little bit farther.
[48:53.930 --> 48:55.330]  And then when I finally just decided,
[48:55.330 --> 48:57.050]  okay, I'm just gonna combine it all, man,
[48:57.050 --> 48:59.610]  and just be, you know, just be who I really am,
[48:59.610 --> 49:00.450]  you know what I mean?
[49:00.450 --> 49:03.810]  And in the world, you know, that's where I am today.
[49:03.810 --> 49:07.450]  So the trees and the cannabis have always been like,
[49:07.450 --> 49:10.410]  you know, right infused with each other, man.
[49:10.410 --> 49:11.850]  One didn't come before the other,
[49:11.850 --> 49:13.650]  but they both help each other.
[49:14.450 --> 49:15.930]  And they still do, you know, it's pretty cool.
[49:15.930 --> 49:16.850]  I gotta fucking know,
[49:16.850 --> 49:19.210]  cause it sounded like a pretty key point in time
[49:19.210 --> 49:21.130]  when you found the Pam.
[49:21.130 --> 49:23.650]  Like you seem to highlight that pretty majorly.
[49:23.650 --> 49:25.450]  Like, do you want to describe it?
[49:25.450 --> 49:26.970]  Like, was it like walking in
[49:26.970 --> 49:29.050]  and meeting your wife for the first time?
[49:32.450 --> 49:33.930]  Well, it was like, you know,
[49:35.010 --> 49:37.450]  I had worked with my fruit trees and I'd, you know,
[49:37.450 --> 49:40.570]  done all kinds of stuff and partied and played in rock bands
[49:40.570 --> 49:42.770]  and grown, grown date and lit up neighborhoods
[49:42.810 --> 49:43.650]  and did all this stuff.
[49:43.650 --> 49:45.930]  But then I, you know, I met my wife and, you know,
[49:45.930 --> 49:48.690]  we were settling down and we ended up getting a little house,
[49:48.690 --> 49:50.930]  you know, out away from everybody, you know what I mean?
[49:50.930 --> 49:53.290]  And I didn't hang out with very many people.
[49:53.290 --> 49:55.810]  And I, you know, I don't, I still don't to this day.
[49:55.810 --> 49:58.890]  I didn't have any connections to the old world.
[49:58.890 --> 50:02.330]  And all I had was some of the old seeds that, you know,
[50:02.330 --> 50:03.650]  I went on a hunt.
[50:03.650 --> 50:05.410]  I remember I was in my new house.
[50:05.410 --> 50:07.530]  I was like, you know, I'm going to grow some plants
[50:07.530 --> 50:08.730]  cause I didn't have weed.
[50:08.730 --> 50:10.490]  And back then right where I was,
[50:10.490 --> 50:11.770]  didn't have very many shops.
[50:11.810 --> 50:13.810]  It was just kind of, it was just kind of funky,
[50:13.810 --> 50:14.650]  you know what I mean?
[50:14.650 --> 50:15.490]  At that time.
[50:15.490 --> 50:17.290]  And I was like, so I went on the hunt,
[50:17.290 --> 50:22.130]  threw all my stuff and I found my old little stupid little
[50:22.130 --> 50:23.690]  container of old seeds.
[50:23.690 --> 50:24.810]  And most of them didn't pop.
[50:24.810 --> 50:26.530]  Only a couple of them came up.
[50:26.530 --> 50:30.530]  And one of those was, was the Pam, you know,
[50:30.530 --> 50:31.690]  the Pam lineage, you know?
[50:31.690 --> 50:33.370]  So I was Pam's mother.
[50:33.370 --> 50:38.370]  And I ended up getting that to give me some seed.
[50:38.370 --> 50:43.370]  And I selected out of just, you know, a few seeds,
[50:44.490 --> 50:47.810]  the Pam one, because of her color and her,
[50:47.810 --> 50:49.330]  and her robustness.
[50:49.330 --> 50:51.370]  And I ended up growing, I told myself, okay,
[50:51.370 --> 50:53.290]  well this is going to be my plant.
[50:53.290 --> 50:56.650]  And because, you know, I needed to, I finally,
[50:56.650 --> 50:58.050]  the first generation came through.
[50:58.050 --> 51:00.050]  I wasn't really prepared to take any clones.
[51:00.050 --> 51:01.250]  I wasn't really set up yet.
[51:01.250 --> 51:02.570]  I just needed some good smoke.
[51:02.570 --> 51:03.410]  I didn't know anybody.
[51:03.410 --> 51:05.290]  It was setting up the house and the farm,
[51:05.290 --> 51:06.970]  and I was just going to grow a couple of plants.
[51:07.010 --> 51:09.450]  But that plant was pretty fucking radical.
[51:09.450 --> 51:11.290]  And I was like really impressed with the plant.
[51:11.290 --> 51:13.130]  And it ended up getting it to give me some seeds.
[51:13.130 --> 51:14.690]  So I planted those seeds right away.
[51:14.690 --> 51:16.170]  I got everything set up.
[51:16.170 --> 51:17.010]  You know what I mean?
[51:17.010 --> 51:18.450]  Everything was ready to go.
[51:18.450 --> 51:22.090]  And I was ready to pull a plant that I could keep
[51:22.090 --> 51:24.570]  and kind of start the library with.
[51:24.570 --> 51:28.650]  And I pulled out the Pam and I grew that for like,
[51:28.650 --> 51:31.690]  you know, two years, two and a half years,
[51:31.690 --> 51:34.130]  you know, inside, outside.
[51:34.130 --> 51:34.970]  Really loved it.
[51:34.970 --> 51:36.170]  People liked smoking it.
[51:36.210 --> 51:37.050]  You know what I mean?
[51:37.050 --> 51:39.210]  I like giving this people, girls really like the Pam.
[51:39.210 --> 51:40.050]  It's interesting.
[51:40.050 --> 51:41.970]  You know, they like that for some reason.
[51:42.890 --> 51:45.410]  It's got that awesome-ing terpene that they all love.
[51:45.410 --> 51:47.570]  Yeah, it's something.
[51:47.570 --> 51:49.650]  I don't know what it is with it, but it's interesting.
[51:49.650 --> 51:50.930]  Girls like that.
[51:50.930 --> 51:54.050]  And yeah, my wife's like,
[51:54.050 --> 51:55.730]  yeah, well, you know, let's call her the Pam.
[51:55.730 --> 51:57.930]  And cause I had to send it off too.
[51:57.930 --> 52:00.690]  I decided, I heard Kevin Jodery talking about Phyllos
[52:00.690 --> 52:02.490]  and how we could gene map stuff
[52:02.490 --> 52:03.770]  and how we could look at the galaxy
[52:03.770 --> 52:07.010]  and figure out where plants lived in the gene,
[52:07.010 --> 52:08.290]  you know, so I could figure out.
[52:08.290 --> 52:09.290]  So I was like, oh man.
[52:09.290 --> 52:11.250]  So I was like, if I could figure out
[52:11.250 --> 52:13.090]  if it was like a skunk or a haze
[52:13.090 --> 52:15.090]  or a frigging Northern Lights
[52:15.090 --> 52:16.850]  or whatever the fuck it was, you know what I mean?
[52:16.850 --> 52:19.530]  That would help me kind of know what it was,
[52:19.530 --> 52:22.210]  better my breathing, tell me a little story about it.
[52:22.210 --> 52:23.250]  You know what I mean?
[52:23.250 --> 52:25.530]  Cause I knew nothing other than it was just a bag seed,
[52:25.530 --> 52:29.810]  you know, and I paid the ticket, sent it to Phyllos
[52:29.810 --> 52:32.570]  and got results back that said,
[52:32.570 --> 52:36.050]  not related to any of the current gene pool basically.
[52:36.050 --> 52:38.850]  And you can look up other plants like the do-si-do
[52:38.850 --> 52:40.250]  and it has all kinds of different plants
[52:40.250 --> 52:42.170]  and the close relatives and the extended family
[52:42.170 --> 52:43.650]  and Pam's was just empty.
[52:43.650 --> 52:45.570]  And I was like, well, you know,
[52:45.570 --> 52:47.170]  she's obviously related to something,
[52:47.170 --> 52:51.050]  but she might not be, you know, prevalent in the pool.
[52:51.050 --> 52:53.730]  So at that point I was like, I'll just hang on to her
[52:53.730 --> 52:56.730]  and keep growing her and start making as many crosses
[52:56.730 --> 52:59.370]  as I can with her and fiddling around with it.
[52:59.890 --> 53:00.730]  And that is-
[53:00.730 --> 53:03.330]  As unique as the person that found her by the sound of it.
[53:03.330 --> 53:05.810]  I mean that in the most polite way ever, brother.
[53:05.810 --> 53:07.130]  But it's definitely-
[53:07.130 --> 53:09.650]  At that point I was like, I'm not gonna kill it
[53:09.650 --> 53:13.050]  because you know, it's not gonna, you know,
[53:13.050 --> 53:16.090]  it's not like, it's not the best weed in the entire world.
[53:16.090 --> 53:19.010]  Like I would prefer smoking a heavy duty cam
[53:19.010 --> 53:20.850]  or an OG or something nasty.
[53:20.850 --> 53:22.890]  But the fact that like, once it came back,
[53:22.890 --> 53:24.010]  I was like, shit, man.
[53:24.010 --> 53:26.210]  It's like, all right, well, I'll keep it around
[53:26.210 --> 53:27.210]  and I'll fiddle around with it.
[53:27.210 --> 53:28.850]  And that's just, that's what I did.
[53:29.610 --> 53:32.650]  And you know, I brought her years down the road.
[53:32.650 --> 53:35.770]  I still haven't figured out exactly where she came from.
[53:35.770 --> 53:39.250]  Never really gotten you that definitive core data,
[53:39.250 --> 53:40.090]  you know what I mean?
[53:40.090 --> 53:42.730]  That I was looking for, but you know,
[53:42.730 --> 53:45.570]  I know her so well that anything I can cross it to,
[53:45.570 --> 53:48.730]  I can see kind of what the influence is really quickly.
[53:48.730 --> 53:51.250]  And I've taken it all kinds of ways
[53:51.250 --> 53:55.610]  from back crossing to reversing to filial generation.
[53:55.610 --> 53:57.010]  I mean, yeah, I've done a lot with it.
[53:57.050 --> 53:59.090]  So it's cool.
[53:59.090 --> 54:02.090]  It's something that's definitely cool and unique,
[54:02.090 --> 54:07.090]  but yeah, that's really where that made me do more seed work.
[54:07.930 --> 54:09.330]  You know, that's when it really pushed me
[54:09.330 --> 54:13.210]  into like make more seed for the library
[54:13.210 --> 54:15.650]  for genetic purposes.
[54:15.650 --> 54:16.930]  You know, I was really getting into
[54:16.930 --> 54:18.890]  the preservational things
[54:18.890 --> 54:22.730]  and trying to learn a little bit more about,
[54:22.730 --> 54:24.650]  you know, how to do it the right way.
[54:24.770 --> 54:25.610]  Yeah.
[54:26.530 --> 54:28.570]  It's always the project is trying to do it the right way.
[54:28.570 --> 54:30.690]  So I gotta ask you, Corey, like,
[54:30.690 --> 54:32.370]  so what got you into planting?
[54:32.370 --> 54:34.290]  Like what got you into it?
[54:34.290 --> 54:36.250]  What's the big?
[54:36.250 --> 54:39.610]  Well, usually there's nobody just like decides
[54:39.610 --> 54:42.530]  to like plant weed like out of nowhere.
[54:42.530 --> 54:43.370]  You know what I mean?
[54:43.370 --> 54:44.210]  Like.
[54:44.210 --> 54:45.050]  I do know what you mean.
[54:45.050 --> 54:45.890]  I understand completely.
[54:45.890 --> 54:50.890]  No, I started smoking probably, you know,
[54:51.410 --> 54:54.330]  back when I was in high school.
[54:55.010 --> 54:55.850]  I was probably like, you know,
[54:55.850 --> 54:56.690]  maybe even younger than that.
[54:56.690 --> 54:57.970]  I enjoyed it.
[54:57.970 --> 55:01.490]  I enjoyed it daily right up until I was about 18.
[55:01.490 --> 55:04.050]  And then every time I smoked,
[55:04.050 --> 55:07.410]  I got crazy paranoia and hated it.
[55:07.410 --> 55:08.250]  It was odd.
[55:08.250 --> 55:11.410]  I mean, you know, so I didn't smoke for quite a long time.
[55:12.570 --> 55:16.490]  I've had surgeries and pain and you name it.
[55:16.490 --> 55:21.290]  So I started using medical cannabis
[55:21.290 --> 55:24.530]  and I would have been fine going to the dispensary
[55:24.530 --> 55:26.330]  and buying it forever.
[55:26.330 --> 55:29.290]  I happened to buy a bag and had some bag seed
[55:29.290 --> 55:32.770]  and my wife talked me into planting them.
[55:32.770 --> 55:34.690]  So here I am, you know.
[55:35.730 --> 55:36.570]  I, you know.
[55:36.570 --> 55:37.410]  Yeah.
[55:37.410 --> 55:40.130]  I feel like she'll regret that decision.
[55:40.130 --> 55:42.090]  No, it's like,
[55:42.090 --> 55:44.970]  cause she regrets encouraging me to plant seeds
[55:44.970 --> 55:45.850]  for the first time.
[55:45.850 --> 55:46.970]  I'll tell you what.
[55:47.650 --> 55:48.490]  Yeah.
[55:48.490 --> 55:51.970]  I mean, it's become a complete obsession.
[55:51.970 --> 55:56.050]  I mean, you know, I can, I can, I've been bit.
[55:56.050 --> 55:58.650]  I understand completely how, you know,
[55:58.650 --> 56:00.610]  everybody's right consumed with it.
[56:00.610 --> 56:05.530]  Cause I'm consumed with it to the point where, you know,
[56:05.530 --> 56:09.450]  if I had to make a choice of using cannabis or growing it,
[56:09.450 --> 56:10.490]  I'd pick growing it.
[56:11.370 --> 56:16.210]  It just, I think the therapy of just working with it,
[56:16.210 --> 56:20.250]  it just has changed my life and how I think about things
[56:20.250 --> 56:24.450]  like, you know, I just, like you were saying earlier,
[56:24.450 --> 56:27.810]  it's, I, it's caused me to live better.
[56:28.650 --> 56:31.090]  It's caused me to, you know,
[56:31.090 --> 56:34.970]  be a better person on the planet, to the planet.
[56:36.170 --> 56:39.290]  Like I said, I started out growing this synthetic and,
[56:39.290 --> 56:42.130]  you know, I just thought that that's how it was.
[56:42.130 --> 56:45.650]  I mean, my dad grew plants when I was a kid and I had rabbits
[56:46.090 --> 56:48.050]  and he made compost and, you know,
[56:48.050 --> 56:50.930]  all the things that I'm running back to today, which,
[56:50.930 --> 56:53.170]  you know, I don't understand why I started otherwise,
[56:53.170 --> 56:56.570]  but regardless here I am, but no, I just,
[56:56.570 --> 57:01.010]  it's an amazing plant and it's, it's,
[57:01.010 --> 57:02.730]  no, it's, it's, it's my passion now.
[57:02.730 --> 57:03.650]  I love it.
[57:03.650 --> 57:05.530]  I love everything about it.
[57:05.530 --> 57:06.370]  I love that.
[57:06.370 --> 57:08.290]  You said the fucking, I would, I would,
[57:08.290 --> 57:11.050]  if I had two options to smoke it or to grow it,
[57:11.050 --> 57:12.810]  I would grow it.
[57:12.810 --> 57:13.650]  Yeah.
[57:13.650 --> 57:14.650]  I totally respect that.
[57:15.130 --> 57:20.130]  So like what really drew me in hard was at a time in my life
[57:20.770 --> 57:23.610]  that things were like just going fucking crazy.
[57:23.610 --> 57:27.010]  It was something that I could control and nurture
[57:27.010 --> 57:31.010]  and take care of that gave me gains and rewards, you know,
[57:31.010 --> 57:35.410]  in a quick enough rate that I felt accomplishment,
[57:35.410 --> 57:36.930]  but also allowed me to like,
[57:36.930 --> 57:39.490]  like take the chaos that's going around in my,
[57:39.490 --> 57:41.250]  in my life at that point in time and,
[57:41.250 --> 57:44.050]  and narrow that focus down and humble you.
[57:44.450 --> 57:46.770]  It's like, I think it's, I think it's so,
[57:46.770 --> 57:47.610]  I don't really like,
[57:47.610 --> 57:48.970]  there's people that have been humbled and,
[57:48.970 --> 57:50.290]  and that like love the plant.
[57:50.290 --> 57:52.530]  And then I could tell that I'm in a room with people,
[57:52.530 --> 57:54.330]  with two people that truly fucking really love
[57:54.330 --> 57:55.370]  what they're doing.
[57:55.370 --> 57:56.210]  And it's like,
[57:56.210 --> 57:57.610]  then there's people that like put their name
[57:57.610 --> 57:59.450]  as like master of marijuana.
[57:59.450 --> 58:01.250]  And it's just like, what are you doing?
[58:01.250 --> 58:03.010]  Like you master what?
[58:03.010 --> 58:06.290]  Like, fuck, you need to get humbled by the plant.
[58:06.290 --> 58:08.090]  And it just drives me nuts.
[58:08.090 --> 58:10.410]  But I mean, I don't want to talk or shit,
[58:10.410 --> 58:12.530]  to be negative or anything like that.
[58:12.530 --> 58:14.250]  But it's, it's like, you don't,
[58:14.250 --> 58:17.170]  once you get to a point in life
[58:17.170 --> 58:18.650]  and you kind of like lose control
[58:18.650 --> 58:20.810]  and you find a way to control in these little things,
[58:20.810 --> 58:22.810]  it's like, and you get that perspective
[58:22.810 --> 58:25.610]  and cannabis can help get you there a little bit faster.
[58:27.170 --> 58:28.050]  It changes things.
[58:28.050 --> 58:29.690]  It makes your decision a little bit different.
[58:29.690 --> 58:31.690]  And you can, and you look at like, you know,
[58:31.690 --> 58:33.170]  how am I going to support my family?
[58:33.170 --> 58:35.170]  And how am I going to also take care of this plant
[58:35.170 --> 58:36.850]  at the same time?
[58:36.850 --> 58:38.490]  Which is interesting as well.
[58:39.490 --> 58:43.970]  It's not like Mr. Trees and planting trees,
[58:43.970 --> 58:46.090]  but it's taught me some patience.
[58:48.170 --> 58:53.170]  That is incredible the way 15 fucking years, fuck me, man.
[58:54.490 --> 58:57.650]  Man, that's a whole nother level of patience, my friend.
[58:58.690 --> 59:03.690]  I've got some cool coconut cream, Alfonso mango crosses,
[59:04.970 --> 59:06.850]  which man is going to be off the charts.
[59:06.850 --> 59:09.850]  I got an ice cream mango and the cross
[59:09.850 --> 59:14.130]  with a Kaiser mango and just some cool funky things
[59:14.130 --> 59:15.810]  that I just cannot wait, man.
[59:15.810 --> 59:18.450]  And in a few years, hopefully a few years,
[59:18.450 --> 59:21.490]  no, I'll have, I'll go take a look at a couple of these.
[59:21.490 --> 59:23.250]  Hopefully they turn out like turds.
[59:23.250 --> 59:24.930]  It'd be so painful.
[59:26.770 --> 59:28.290]  I was out there, I was out there
[59:28.290 --> 59:30.250]  cause they're outside, they're real trees, right?
[59:30.250 --> 59:31.970]  And if it gets into the thirties, you know,
[59:31.970 --> 59:34.090]  mangoes don't like being in the thirties, man.
[59:34.090 --> 59:35.210]  They don't like that.
[59:35.210 --> 59:38.050]  So they'll get burnt up with the frost or all that.
[59:38.050 --> 59:40.210]  Like nobody's business and you'll kill all these.
[59:40.210 --> 59:43.970]  I've had hundreds of seedlings that I just wish
[59:43.970 --> 59:46.850]  I just took an extra 10 minutes and covered
[59:46.850 --> 59:49.330]  with a bed sheet or threw something over them
[59:49.330 --> 59:50.610]  or cut them underneath.
[59:50.610 --> 59:52.410]  An extra minute that one time.
[59:52.410 --> 59:55.050]  You know, I just like, ah, they'll be fine for a night, man.
[59:55.050 --> 59:58.690]  No, no, even here, you know,
[59:58.690 --> 01:00:00.130]  you'll kill a lot of those youngsters.
[01:00:00.130 --> 01:00:02.490]  So this year I've been really good,
[01:00:02.490 --> 01:00:07.490]  really on covering the seedlings, covering the mangoes
[01:00:08.810 --> 01:00:11.610]  so that I don't set myself back another few years.
[01:00:11.610 --> 01:00:12.450]  You know what I mean?
[01:00:12.450 --> 01:00:15.210]  So I learned my lesson the hard way there for sure.
[01:00:17.570 --> 01:00:18.410]  That's crazy.
[01:00:18.410 --> 01:00:23.330]  I mean, like I have, my family has like land in Tuscany
[01:00:23.330 --> 01:00:24.530]  and they've been like trying to pursue me.
[01:00:24.530 --> 01:00:26.090]  I want to go and grow orange trees
[01:00:26.090 --> 01:00:28.450]  cause you can actually get land in Tuscany
[01:00:28.450 --> 01:00:31.330]  for like ridiculously fucking cheap.
[01:00:31.330 --> 01:00:35.050]  And if you have like a parent that is like,
[01:00:35.050 --> 01:00:37.410]  if you have an ancestral line that goes to Italy,
[01:00:37.410 --> 01:00:40.770]  you can actually like get your Italian citizenship,
[01:00:40.770 --> 01:00:42.410]  like not that crazy challenging.
[01:00:42.410 --> 01:00:44.210]  Like it's actually pretty easy.
[01:00:44.210 --> 01:00:45.050]  That's not bad.
[01:00:45.050 --> 01:00:47.610]  But like, let's just fucking, so our goal right now,
[01:00:47.610 --> 01:00:49.490]  we're waiting for everything to process and get through.
[01:00:49.490 --> 01:00:52.890]  But our goal is to like move to Sicily, buy an orchard
[01:00:52.890 --> 01:00:55.810]  and some land and try to regenerate it.
[01:00:55.810 --> 01:00:58.610]  Now I'm going to pose a wacky ass fucking question to you
[01:00:58.610 --> 01:01:00.570]  guys, but I think I'm in the right spot to do it.
[01:01:01.130 --> 01:01:03.370]  So do you think you could do no-till
[01:01:03.370 --> 01:01:05.710]  rested soil methods indoor?
[01:01:06.690 --> 01:01:08.370]  Like, so like instead, you know,
[01:01:08.370 --> 01:01:10.410]  like how you have the regenerative,
[01:01:10.410 --> 01:01:12.730]  like no-till farming methods where what they do
[01:01:12.730 --> 01:01:14.050]  is they work the land for six months
[01:01:14.050 --> 01:01:16.650]  and then they have animals graze it.
[01:01:16.650 --> 01:01:19.970]  Do you think you could rotate through two four by four
[01:01:19.970 --> 01:01:23.610]  pet tents and like graze them with rabbits
[01:01:23.610 --> 01:01:26.410]  and chickens in between?
[01:01:27.410 --> 01:01:32.410]  So I have like, I don't know, a bunch.
[01:01:34.330 --> 01:01:36.770]  I mean, yeah, you know, more than 10,
[01:01:36.770 --> 01:01:41.130]  four by four little veggie beds and, you know,
[01:01:41.130 --> 01:01:43.530]  cannabis hoop houses, funny things like that.
[01:01:43.530 --> 01:01:45.810]  You can turn them into things as throughout the season
[01:01:45.810 --> 01:01:48.130]  as you need things, you know?
[01:01:48.130 --> 01:01:51.650]  And I also had, you know, I had chickens for a long time
[01:01:51.650 --> 01:01:55.610]  that I allowed to roam around everywhere and, you know,
[01:01:55.650 --> 01:01:58.050]  graze things when they were down.
[01:01:58.050 --> 01:02:01.450]  Even they'd get into shit when they weren't down,
[01:02:01.450 --> 01:02:03.370]  it caused a ruckus and stuff like that.
[01:02:03.370 --> 01:02:06.490]  So I had to put a stop to that over, you know,
[01:02:06.490 --> 01:02:09.250]  year and a half, I kind of let that ride a little bit.
[01:02:09.250 --> 01:02:11.570]  And then I put a kibosh and a lot of the chicken move
[01:02:11.570 --> 01:02:15.130]  and then become more like chicken tractor-esque
[01:02:15.130 --> 01:02:18.850]  and more precise about how you're gonna do that, you know?
[01:02:18.850 --> 01:02:22.110]  But yeah, you can definitely just graze it over
[01:02:22.110 --> 01:02:23.250]  with chickens and stuff.
[01:02:23.250 --> 01:02:24.490]  They'll do a good job with it.
[01:02:24.690 --> 01:02:26.090]  I know chickens for sure.
[01:02:26.090 --> 01:02:29.370]  Some ducks will eat some snails and some other stuff too.
[01:02:29.370 --> 01:02:31.370]  If you wanna get crazy and have a little pool of water
[01:02:31.370 --> 01:02:33.090]  and stuff around around here, you can do that too.
[01:02:33.090 --> 01:02:36.330]  But chickens I had running around, they graze over stuff
[01:02:36.330 --> 01:02:38.050]  and, you know, do their business.
[01:02:38.050 --> 01:02:41.570]  And I can just kind of plant in, just lightly dig
[01:02:41.570 --> 01:02:43.690]  and just plant where I was without kind of messing
[01:02:43.690 --> 01:02:45.170]  or tilling anything up, you know?
[01:02:45.170 --> 01:02:47.490]  And it worked just fine for a lot of time,
[01:02:47.490 --> 01:02:52.410]  but I got tired of the chickens and I'd rather till once.
[01:02:52.450 --> 01:02:54.450]  If I'm gonna plant like a seasonal crop,
[01:02:55.970 --> 01:02:59.090]  like fruit trees and stuff, perennial trees,
[01:02:59.090 --> 01:03:01.650]  things are gonna live for several years in the same spot
[01:03:01.650 --> 01:03:03.690]  and have woody stems and stuff like that.
[01:03:03.690 --> 01:03:07.570]  The no-till, no move in the soil, fungal dominance,
[01:03:07.570 --> 01:03:09.130]  that's the way to go, you know what I mean?
[01:03:09.130 --> 01:03:09.970]  That's what they need.
[01:03:09.970 --> 01:03:13.050]  They need their own little undisturbed fungal dominant
[01:03:13.050 --> 01:03:17.110]  rhizosphere plugged into nature, the whole kibosh.
[01:03:17.110 --> 01:03:20.370]  But like a vegetable bed or like cannabis
[01:03:21.370 --> 01:03:25.570]  or anything that's just a seasonal crop, like outside
[01:03:25.570 --> 01:03:27.890]  or in a no-till environment, you know,
[01:03:27.890 --> 01:03:29.770]  you might get some worms.
[01:03:29.770 --> 01:03:32.370]  I think that there are benefits to it.
[01:03:32.370 --> 01:03:34.810]  And then there's also not benefits to it.
[01:03:34.810 --> 01:03:37.250]  You know, you can kind of do, you can do a lot more tilling
[01:03:37.250 --> 01:03:40.290]  and you can be more on the bacterial side and, you know,
[01:03:40.290 --> 01:03:42.530]  it's gonna be a quicker turnover and stuff like that.
[01:03:42.530 --> 01:03:45.490]  So a lot of my beds these days, I'll just till it all up,
[01:03:45.490 --> 01:03:48.090]  make it all nice, add some stuff to it, some compost,
[01:03:48.130 --> 01:03:50.770]  some worm castings, like I was saying before,
[01:03:50.770 --> 01:03:53.250]  compost and worm castings fixes a lot for me.
[01:03:53.250 --> 01:03:57.610]  And, you know, till that into the beds,
[01:03:57.610 --> 01:04:00.410]  till it once, plant it out with either vegetables
[01:04:00.410 --> 01:04:03.170]  or cannabis, and then when it's done, tear it down
[01:04:03.170 --> 01:04:05.810]  and do the same thing, you know, and kind of rotate through,
[01:04:05.810 --> 01:04:07.890]  you know, this time I did this, this time I did this,
[01:04:07.890 --> 01:04:11.150]  beans in one, you know, stuff like that.
[01:04:11.150 --> 01:04:12.850]  I never just plant one thing either.
[01:04:12.850 --> 01:04:14.650]  I always kind of do what you do with a cover crop
[01:04:14.650 --> 01:04:17.130]  of some sort or plant a couple of extra things in there,
[01:04:17.130 --> 01:04:19.050]  you know, just a couple of different things.
[01:04:19.050 --> 01:04:21.610]  I gotta say, I sent Peter some, so like,
[01:04:21.610 --> 01:04:23.410]  you go visit Peter, don't you?
[01:04:23.410 --> 01:04:26.090]  Like you're in the area, aren't you?
[01:04:26.090 --> 01:04:29.410]  I sent him some sample packs, like grab a couple of them
[01:04:29.410 --> 01:04:32.050]  or a 10 grammer off of him next time you're there to try.
[01:04:32.050 --> 01:04:36.190]  I've got like 20 or 30 different things in my cover crop
[01:04:36.190 --> 01:04:38.490]  from flowers to herbs and stuff like that.
[01:04:38.490 --> 01:04:40.250]  I will, I'll grab one, I'll make him give me one of those
[01:04:40.250 --> 01:04:41.090]  for sure.
[01:04:41.090 --> 01:04:42.250]  Oh, fuck yeah, I'll make sure.
[01:04:42.250 --> 01:04:45.930]  Have you tried, have you tried like Peruvian black mint
[01:04:45.930 --> 01:04:48.850]  or like hodaka before?
[01:04:48.850 --> 01:04:49.690]  It's egg.
[01:04:49.690 --> 01:04:51.770]  No, I mean, I've grown like, like mint wise,
[01:04:51.770 --> 01:04:54.690]  I have like a chocolate mint and an orange mint.
[01:04:54.690 --> 01:04:56.330]  It looks like a fucking marigold.
[01:04:56.330 --> 01:05:00.370]  A spear mint, but I don't have any of those, you know,
[01:05:00.370 --> 01:05:02.330]  couple of cool, like different basils.
[01:05:02.330 --> 01:05:04.730]  Oh, there you go, there's some marigold action, nice.
[01:05:04.730 --> 01:05:07.490]  No, that's the Peruvian black mint,
[01:05:07.490 --> 01:05:11.590]  it's called Hakuta, but apparently,
[01:05:11.590 --> 01:05:14.410]  apparently the roots give off a chemical
[01:05:14.410 --> 01:05:16.810]  that can actually fight blind weed
[01:05:16.810 --> 01:05:19.650]  and a lot of like really nasty stuff.
[01:05:19.650 --> 01:05:21.570]  So I've like, I'm glad I didn't put it
[01:05:21.570 --> 01:05:25.010]  in my cover crop blend, but I'm experimenting with it
[01:05:25.010 --> 01:05:27.090]  because I think it might be something fun to play with
[01:05:27.090 --> 01:05:28.450]  if it's putting something else in there,
[01:05:28.450 --> 01:05:29.530]  but it's supposed to be quite delicious.
[01:05:29.530 --> 01:05:31.290]  I haven't actually tried it yet, so I should do so today.
[01:05:31.290 --> 01:05:33.730]  Yeah, that's interesting, that's cool.
[01:05:33.730 --> 01:05:34.570]  That's way cool.
[01:05:34.570 --> 01:05:35.710]  That's really tasty.
[01:05:35.710 --> 01:05:37.890]  But yeah, grab one of those too from Peter as well.
[01:05:37.890 --> 01:05:39.690]  And I'll make sure you send one to Corey as well
[01:05:39.690 --> 01:05:40.530]  because I'm excited.
[01:05:40.530 --> 01:05:41.970]  Heck yeah, heck yeah.
[01:05:42.010 --> 01:05:42.850]  Yeah, I'll get you hooked up
[01:05:42.850 --> 01:05:45.370]  with a bunch of funky things that I do.
[01:05:45.370 --> 01:05:49.010]  You know, we got popping corn that I've been breeding
[01:05:49.010 --> 01:05:50.850]  for a couple of years of different colors
[01:05:50.850 --> 01:05:52.050]  and different stuff like that.
[01:05:52.050 --> 01:05:55.890]  You got weird things like moringa trees
[01:05:55.890 --> 01:06:00.890]  and Barbados cherry trees and weird like funky melons,
[01:06:01.850 --> 01:06:05.930]  some different, yeah, lots of peppers are cool.
[01:06:05.930 --> 01:06:06.770]  I'm a big pepper.
[01:06:06.770 --> 01:06:08.690]  I grabbed the peppers, I grabbed the pumpkins.
[01:06:08.690 --> 01:06:10.250]  I got the radishes.
[01:06:10.370 --> 01:06:13.450]  Yeah, I grabbed a bunch of those.
[01:06:13.450 --> 01:06:14.290]  Yeah.
[01:06:14.290 --> 01:06:18.170]  Yeah, I make lots of pumpkin pie, lots of pumpkin breads.
[01:06:18.170 --> 01:06:19.010]  I love that stuff.
[01:06:19.010 --> 01:06:20.010]  My kids love that stuff, you know?
[01:06:20.010 --> 01:06:21.610]  So we make lots of that.
[01:06:21.610 --> 01:06:23.370]  Use the seeds everywhere all the time.
[01:06:23.370 --> 01:06:26.210]  We'll do different, yeah, I do all kinds of weird stuff,
[01:06:26.210 --> 01:06:29.090]  but I always try to get kind of, you know,
[01:06:29.090 --> 01:06:32.090]  off the wall medicinal, strange things,
[01:06:32.090 --> 01:06:33.650]  you know what I mean, of good origin.
[01:06:33.650 --> 01:06:35.330]  So, and I try to do a lot of preserving
[01:06:35.330 --> 01:06:37.410]  and stuff like that with everything.
[01:06:37.410 --> 01:06:39.850]  So I'll hook you up with some stuff.
[01:06:40.450 --> 01:06:41.290]  I love that stuff.
[01:06:41.290 --> 01:06:43.450]  I got, I'll, I get to send you a bunch.
[01:06:43.450 --> 01:06:45.170]  I have a feeling that we're going to have
[01:06:45.170 --> 01:06:47.130]  a very nice relationship, the three of us.
[01:06:47.130 --> 01:06:49.170]  I think it's going to be very enjoyable.
[01:06:49.170 --> 01:06:50.330]  I am looking forward,
[01:06:50.330 --> 01:06:52.970]  because unfortunately this is the first episode.
[01:06:52.970 --> 01:06:55.090]  So really like, Corey, did you put any,
[01:06:55.090 --> 01:06:56.850]  like, do you have them popped in down?
[01:06:56.850 --> 01:06:57.690]  How big are they?
[01:06:57.690 --> 01:06:58.810]  Do we want to show,
[01:06:58.810 --> 01:07:01.010]  are you able to show them off a little bit?
[01:07:01.010 --> 01:07:02.370]  I definitely can.
[01:07:02.370 --> 01:07:04.450]  I just, I'm going to have to flip my camera
[01:07:04.450 --> 01:07:06.210]  because I don't know how to flip my camera.
[01:07:06.210 --> 01:07:07.050]  So.
[01:07:07.050 --> 01:07:08.530]  Oh good, wait, I'm excited.
[01:07:08.530 --> 01:07:09.370]  I can't wait.
[01:07:09.890 --> 01:07:10.930]  Okay.
[01:07:10.930 --> 01:07:11.770]  So.
[01:07:11.770 --> 01:07:13.570]  Flipping the camera on this bloody stream yard
[01:07:13.570 --> 01:07:15.250]  is made the worst way ever.
[01:07:15.250 --> 01:07:17.290]  It's just like, it's not right.
[01:07:17.290 --> 01:07:18.650]  It's just grueling.
[01:07:18.650 --> 01:07:21.410]  Has anybody been keeping an eye on chat?
[01:07:21.410 --> 01:07:25.010]  I have not been keeping an eye on chat as much as I have.
[01:07:25.010 --> 01:07:25.930]  Should have been.
[01:07:25.930 --> 01:07:26.770]  There's Billy Herb.
[01:07:26.770 --> 01:07:27.610]  Hi everybody.
[01:07:27.610 --> 01:07:28.650]  Hope you're all doing well.
[01:07:28.650 --> 01:07:30.330]  Let me find this.
[01:07:30.330 --> 01:07:31.770]  Oh, here we go.
[01:07:31.770 --> 01:07:32.850]  There we go.
[01:07:34.290 --> 01:07:35.130]  Yeah.
[01:07:35.130 --> 01:07:35.970]  Which ones are, which ones are those?
[01:07:35.970 --> 01:07:37.010]  Are those the?
[01:07:37.010 --> 01:07:37.850]  These are the SFVs.
[01:07:37.850 --> 01:07:38.930]  Oh, I got to make you big.
[01:07:39.890 --> 01:07:40.730]  Nice.
[01:07:40.730 --> 01:07:41.890]  We don't need to look at us.
[01:07:41.890 --> 01:07:45.450]  We can look at you and be big and you can be charming.
[01:07:45.450 --> 01:07:46.290]  Let me find the camera.
[01:07:46.290 --> 01:07:47.250]  There we go.
[01:07:47.250 --> 01:07:48.090]  Nice.
[01:07:49.090 --> 01:07:51.370]  That's really nice and even on the structure.
[01:07:51.370 --> 01:07:54.170]  And so do you have a pretty strong fan in there?
[01:07:55.810 --> 01:07:58.250]  It's not terrible strong, but no, they're,
[01:07:58.250 --> 01:08:00.010]  they're, they're rugged plants.
[01:08:00.010 --> 01:08:00.850]  They really are.
[01:08:00.850 --> 01:08:01.890]  They, you know.
[01:08:03.170 --> 01:08:04.970]  What's your lows in there at night?
[01:08:05.890 --> 01:08:06.730]  It's warm.
[01:08:06.850 --> 01:08:09.050]  My, my, my boil is right in the next room.
[01:08:09.050 --> 01:08:11.170]  So, you know, it's staying pretty warm.
[01:08:11.170 --> 01:08:14.210]  So yeah, no, I've, I've, I'm pretty lucky on that regard.
[01:08:14.210 --> 01:08:17.170]  It's a little drier than I'd like it to be,
[01:08:17.170 --> 01:08:19.330]  but you know, I'm kind of sacrificed
[01:08:19.330 --> 01:08:21.330]  to the surroundings I have at this point.
[01:08:22.410 --> 01:08:23.250]  Totally.
[01:08:23.250 --> 01:08:24.090]  Yeah.
[01:08:24.090 --> 01:08:24.930]  Yeah.
[01:08:24.930 --> 01:08:25.770]  Having the little youngsters, man.
[01:08:25.770 --> 01:08:26.610]  Like all the seedlings are always,
[01:08:26.610 --> 01:08:27.850]  they're just pushed in a corner.
[01:08:27.850 --> 01:08:30.290]  And when they start to actually show something
[01:08:30.290 --> 01:08:32.090]  then they get moved into the better spots
[01:08:32.090 --> 01:08:33.610]  and they get played around with, you know.
[01:08:33.610 --> 01:08:34.450]  They're still in there.
[01:08:34.450 --> 01:08:35.290]  100%.
[01:08:35.290 --> 01:08:36.130]  100%.
[01:08:36.490 --> 01:08:37.490]  Yeah.
[01:08:37.490 --> 01:08:39.250]  I'm always trying to start seeds in places
[01:08:39.250 --> 01:08:41.090]  and I'm like, ah, I can put them over there for a while.
[01:08:41.090 --> 01:08:42.130]  They don't need a lot.
[01:08:42.130 --> 01:08:42.970]  You know?
[01:08:42.970 --> 01:08:45.490]  So, it's cool.
[01:08:45.490 --> 01:08:46.330]  Totally.
[01:08:46.330 --> 01:08:49.410]  I've like been trying to push the envelope lately
[01:08:49.410 --> 01:08:51.850]  to see how many I can scram into a space.
[01:08:51.850 --> 01:08:54.730]  How many do you, do you, do you get going on in there, Cory?
[01:08:54.730 --> 01:08:56.770]  Like you look like you've got a few things.
[01:08:56.770 --> 01:08:59.250]  You look like, I think we need to see a little bit more
[01:08:59.250 --> 01:09:00.530]  about what's going on in your space.
[01:09:00.530 --> 01:09:02.090]  Cause he looks like he's got a little bit more
[01:09:02.090 --> 01:09:02.930]  than what he's like.
[01:09:03.370 --> 01:09:06.450]  It's like, I got a bunch of moms floating around.
[01:09:06.450 --> 01:09:07.330]  Oh, there's my wife.
[01:09:07.330 --> 01:09:08.170]  I got it.
[01:09:08.170 --> 01:09:09.010]  Yeah.
[01:09:09.010 --> 01:09:09.850]  You want the wheat?
[01:09:09.850 --> 01:09:10.690]  Here's the wheat.
[01:09:10.690 --> 01:09:11.530]  Here's the wheat.
[01:09:11.530 --> 01:09:12.690]  Here's our salad for these.
[01:09:12.690 --> 01:09:13.530]  There you go.
[01:09:17.210 --> 01:09:18.970]  So what do you got back there, Runner?
[01:09:18.970 --> 01:09:22.090]  So yeah, I've got a lot of everything.
[01:09:22.930 --> 01:09:25.770]  You know, I've got some, some small clones here
[01:09:25.770 --> 01:09:30.370]  and a whole bunch of blotch mothers all around
[01:09:30.370 --> 01:09:32.730]  and some smaller stuff.
[01:09:33.890 --> 01:09:38.890]  I do have, Tyler, I got a cool ranch.
[01:09:42.010 --> 01:09:43.250]  Oh, no way.
[01:09:43.250 --> 01:09:45.690]  Yep. I got a cool ranch and I popped three
[01:09:45.690 --> 01:09:46.650]  and I get one female.
[01:09:46.650 --> 01:09:48.890]  So I'm excited about that.
[01:09:48.890 --> 01:09:51.050]  That's going to be, yeah, that's going to be going
[01:09:51.050 --> 01:09:54.090]  into flower here probably in another month or so.
[01:09:54.090 --> 01:09:55.410]  But yeah, yeah.
[01:09:55.410 --> 01:09:57.010]  I'm really excited about that one.
[01:09:57.010 --> 01:09:58.090]  No, that's good, man.
[01:09:58.090 --> 01:09:59.490]  Those are, those are killer.
[01:09:59.490 --> 01:10:01.210]  You got, you're going to get a lot of pine.
[01:10:01.250 --> 01:10:02.290]  It's going to come into those.
[01:10:02.290 --> 01:10:04.330]  If you like pine stuff, you're going to get some pine.
[01:10:04.330 --> 01:10:07.410]  It's going to really be, you know, like the, yeah,
[01:10:07.410 --> 01:10:08.370]  the cool ranch.
[01:10:08.370 --> 01:10:11.690]  I actually got a couple of people hit me up
[01:10:11.690 --> 01:10:16.410]  and asked me if I got any more cool ranch.
[01:10:16.410 --> 01:10:18.330]  And, you know, they really liked the cool ranch
[01:10:18.330 --> 01:10:20.850]  and I didn't make a ton of them.
[01:10:20.850 --> 01:10:22.930]  It was just like, what it was like pollen was flying.
[01:10:22.930 --> 01:10:25.050]  I'm like, oh, these are going to be good and cool.
[01:10:25.050 --> 01:10:27.690]  And I just, you know, I just, I just put them out.
[01:10:27.690 --> 01:10:29.810]  Is that how the cool ranch name came up?
[01:10:30.090 --> 01:10:33.970]  Yeah, it's another one for my wife, man.
[01:10:33.970 --> 01:10:34.810]  She's good, dude.
[01:10:34.810 --> 01:10:36.050]  She's good.
[01:10:36.050 --> 01:10:37.050]  She does a good job.
[01:10:38.490 --> 01:10:41.370]  But yeah, so when I, when it's one of those
[01:10:41.370 --> 01:10:43.050]  that I should have made more of, you know what I mean?
[01:10:43.050 --> 01:10:44.850]  So they're definitely, definitely cool.
[01:10:44.850 --> 01:10:49.410]  And you get all that, that Skittles and pine stuff in there
[01:10:49.410 --> 01:10:51.930]  because of the Testerosa and the black lime
[01:10:51.930 --> 01:10:53.210]  and all that other stuff, right?
[01:10:53.210 --> 01:10:54.330]  With the cool ranch there.
[01:10:54.330 --> 01:10:57.890]  And yeah, you're going to, yeah, you're going to dig those.
[01:10:57.890 --> 01:10:58.730]  Those are cool.
[01:10:58.730 --> 01:10:59.570]  Those are good.
[01:11:00.330 --> 01:11:01.170]  I'm stoked.
[01:11:01.170 --> 01:11:03.970]  Yeah, I can't, I buy them constantly
[01:11:03.970 --> 01:11:06.490]  and I can't grow them fast enough.
[01:11:06.490 --> 01:11:09.370]  Like we were talking about, I just have to, you know
[01:11:09.370 --> 01:11:10.930]  I'm like, oh, that sounds great.
[01:11:10.930 --> 01:11:12.010]  Wow, that sounds great.
[01:11:12.010 --> 01:11:12.850]  You know?
[01:11:13.810 --> 01:11:17.530]  Every time I go through my cooler, I'm like, oh God,
[01:11:17.530 --> 01:11:19.330]  I wish, you know, you just got so many things.
[01:11:19.330 --> 01:11:20.970]  Like, oh, I forgot about this.
[01:11:20.970 --> 01:11:22.090]  Oh, I got to do this.
[01:11:22.090 --> 01:11:24.570]  You know, it's like, it's got to focus too.
[01:11:24.570 --> 01:11:26.050]  And then you get three things
[01:11:26.050 --> 01:11:28.370]  that are ridiculously good too.
[01:11:28.370 --> 01:11:30.090]  It's yeah, it's nuts.
[01:11:31.090 --> 01:11:34.250]  Yeah, I made the mistake of just popping too many things
[01:11:34.250 --> 01:11:36.450]  and just trying to just do too much, you know?
[01:11:36.450 --> 01:11:40.170]  And then you can't really give everything that they need.
[01:11:40.170 --> 01:11:42.690]  You know, and then you waste a lot of it, you know
[01:11:42.690 --> 01:11:45.370]  trying to go too fast, you know?
[01:11:45.370 --> 01:11:48.290]  So I've been trying to slow down like that
[01:11:48.290 --> 01:11:51.890]  and try to be more methodical because it's got, it's hard.
[01:11:51.890 --> 01:11:54.650]  Dude, there's so much cool stuff to look at, you know?
[01:11:54.650 --> 01:11:57.170]  You just can't, can't wait, you know?
[01:11:57.210 --> 01:11:59.690]  Yeah, and then that's what I'm trying to do
[01:11:59.690 --> 01:12:01.690]  is find the ones that like I like
[01:12:01.690 --> 01:12:05.650]  and try to keep them around and I like them all.
[01:12:05.650 --> 01:12:07.490]  Yep, yep.
[01:12:07.490 --> 01:12:08.650]  It's the best thing ever, man,
[01:12:08.650 --> 01:12:12.010]  because it's like, if you find something that you like,
[01:12:12.010 --> 01:12:14.290]  keep it around because the chances
[01:12:14.290 --> 01:12:15.730]  that you find in that again,
[01:12:15.730 --> 01:12:17.490]  the way, just the way that you liked it,
[01:12:17.490 --> 01:12:18.330]  you know what I mean?
[01:12:18.330 --> 01:12:20.650]  Or just they're slim to none, you know what I mean?
[01:12:20.650 --> 01:12:22.050]  It's hard to do, you know what I mean?
[01:12:22.050 --> 01:12:23.050]  It really is hard to do.
[01:12:23.050 --> 01:12:26.250]  So yeah, I try to, yeah.
[01:12:26.250 --> 01:12:27.290]  I've got too many plants.
[01:12:27.290 --> 01:12:29.090]  I'd be like, man, I should have kept that.
[01:12:29.090 --> 01:12:30.010]  I should have kept that.
[01:12:30.010 --> 01:12:30.850]  I'll find another one.
[01:12:30.850 --> 01:12:31.970]  You never find another one.
[01:12:31.970 --> 01:12:33.810]  It's like, you know, it's like you find another,
[01:12:33.810 --> 01:12:35.770]  you know, but it's different, you know?
[01:12:35.770 --> 01:12:36.610]  It's not the same.
[01:12:36.610 --> 01:12:37.890]  I can't throw anything away.
[01:12:37.890 --> 01:12:38.730]  I'm the worst.
[01:12:38.730 --> 01:12:39.890]  I can't throw anything away.
[01:12:39.890 --> 01:12:42.410]  I haven't thrown anything away for three fucking years.
[01:12:42.410 --> 01:12:45.450]  I'm like, I just can't fucking do it, man.
[01:12:45.450 --> 01:12:46.770]  And it just kills me.
[01:12:46.770 --> 01:12:48.770]  And it's just like, I liked it.
[01:12:48.770 --> 01:12:51.370]  And then I run it again and I'm like, wow,
[01:12:51.370 --> 01:12:53.170]  I did even better this time.
[01:12:53.170 --> 01:12:54.970]  It's like even better than last time.
[01:12:55.010 --> 01:12:57.330]  I'm like, well, I can't get rid of it now.
[01:12:57.330 --> 01:12:59.530]  And then you run some else is like, this is special.
[01:12:59.530 --> 01:13:00.810]  I need some room.
[01:13:01.730 --> 01:13:02.570]  Winter's coming.
[01:13:02.570 --> 01:13:03.450]  What am I gonna do?
[01:13:03.450 --> 01:13:04.450]  You know what I mean?
[01:13:04.450 --> 01:13:07.010]  I got asked, do both of your wives consume?
[01:13:08.610 --> 01:13:09.450]  Yes.
[01:13:10.650 --> 01:13:12.770]  Does your wife consume Mr. Trees?
[01:13:12.770 --> 01:13:15.090]  Yeah, she used to consume a lot more
[01:13:15.090 --> 01:13:16.570]  than she does these days, you know?
[01:13:16.570 --> 01:13:18.370]  But yeah, that was one of the things
[01:13:18.370 --> 01:13:21.250]  that brought me and her together was all the weed smoke.
[01:13:21.250 --> 01:13:23.610]  And my pocket smelled like a skunk.
[01:13:23.610 --> 01:13:24.530]  She's like, you smell awesome.
[01:13:25.090 --> 01:13:27.330]  When I first met her, you smell a skunk?
[01:13:27.330 --> 01:13:28.250]  Do you smell a skunk?
[01:13:28.250 --> 01:13:29.410]  I'm like, no, that's my pocket.
[01:13:29.410 --> 01:13:30.730]  She's like, all right.
[01:13:30.730 --> 01:13:31.570]  That's all it is.
[01:13:31.570 --> 01:13:34.010]  I'm gonna stand next to you for the rest of the night.
[01:13:34.010 --> 01:13:35.690]  Yeah, she, every once in a while,
[01:13:35.690 --> 01:13:36.770]  we'll go out and have a good time.
[01:13:36.770 --> 01:13:39.010]  But she's more of a recreational smoker these days
[01:13:39.010 --> 01:13:40.770]  as opposed to me.
[01:13:40.770 --> 01:13:42.850]  I'm a, you know.
[01:13:42.850 --> 01:13:45.090]  I think what we should propose here
[01:13:45.090 --> 01:13:47.490]  is that when we get through the run,
[01:13:47.490 --> 01:13:50.530]  because I mean, you might be doing some outdoors.
[01:13:50.530 --> 01:13:52.570]  I mean, we're probably gonna have flower
[01:13:52.570 --> 01:13:53.810]  at some point in time
[01:13:53.850 --> 01:13:55.410]  that we're gonna have to do a tasting of this
[01:13:55.410 --> 01:13:56.850]  and like talk about it, right?
[01:13:56.850 --> 01:13:59.650]  So I think we should force the girls to do it.
[01:14:00.570 --> 01:14:02.890]  Just make them come on and do it, right?
[01:14:02.890 --> 01:14:04.250]  Like that would be a lot of fun.
[01:14:04.250 --> 01:14:05.970]  Like we should definitely have that.
[01:14:05.970 --> 01:14:06.810]  Cause that would be cool.
[01:14:06.810 --> 01:14:07.650]  Yeah, that would be nice.
[01:14:07.650 --> 01:14:09.410]  Yeah, that'd be radical.
[01:14:09.410 --> 01:14:10.490]  I'd like that a lot.
[01:14:10.490 --> 01:14:11.690]  I'd love to see that.
[01:14:12.770 --> 01:14:14.410]  That would be cool as shit.
[01:14:14.410 --> 01:14:16.490]  She, yeah, she's down, I'm sure.
[01:14:16.490 --> 01:14:17.330]  All good.
[01:14:17.330 --> 01:14:18.170]  All right, it's official.
[01:14:18.170 --> 01:14:20.530]  So like we gotta do a tasting of this.
[01:14:20.530 --> 01:14:22.090]  We're good to go.
[01:14:22.530 --> 01:14:23.370]  We're good to go.
[01:14:23.370 --> 01:14:24.210]  We did a fishing report, you know?
[01:14:24.210 --> 01:14:25.210]  Yeah, I love that.
[01:14:25.210 --> 01:14:29.130]  So where did you mention that pine was coming through
[01:14:29.130 --> 01:14:30.970]  on that cool ranch you were mentioning before?
[01:14:30.970 --> 01:14:32.970]  Yeah, the pine tar, the pine tar in Breadline.
[01:14:32.970 --> 01:14:34.650]  Yeah, the pine tar bush.
[01:14:34.650 --> 01:14:37.650]  Yeah, I got that from the, you know,
[01:14:37.650 --> 01:14:40.890]  an old head, legitimate, legitimate pine tar.
[01:14:40.890 --> 01:14:44.610]  You know, squatty indica, straight up menthol
[01:14:44.610 --> 01:14:49.210]  and pine trees, tacky, just overwhelmingly pine
[01:14:49.210 --> 01:14:50.770]  to the point where it was like,
[01:14:51.770 --> 01:14:54.730]  I couldn't smoke it a lot because it was just so,
[01:14:54.730 --> 01:14:57.890]  it was like, take the pain off the room, pine.
[01:14:57.890 --> 01:15:00.690]  It was really, I mean, it was really, really strong.
[01:15:00.690 --> 01:15:01.850]  Intensive.
[01:15:01.850 --> 01:15:04.130]  You know, I originally got the pine tar
[01:15:04.130 --> 01:15:07.690]  for appetite and stimulation, you know what I mean?
[01:15:07.690 --> 01:15:09.890]  I wanted something that made me really hungry all the time
[01:15:09.890 --> 01:15:13.250]  so I could mac down and put on some serious weight,
[01:15:13.250 --> 01:15:14.090]  you know what I mean?
[01:15:14.090 --> 01:15:14.930]  Eat all the time instead.
[01:15:14.930 --> 01:15:16.370]  I've had a couple of those.
[01:15:16.370 --> 01:15:17.490]  Like they don't even get you high,
[01:15:17.490 --> 01:15:18.490]  they just make you eat.
[01:15:18.490 --> 01:15:19.690]  Yeah.
[01:15:19.690 --> 01:15:22.050]  But the turps were so strong
[01:15:22.050 --> 01:15:24.410]  and it just got me so wound up that I was like,
[01:15:24.410 --> 01:15:28.050]  wow, this is impressive stuff.
[01:15:28.050 --> 01:15:30.450]  So I did a, you know, I did the same thing
[01:15:30.450 --> 01:15:31.610]  kind of with the candahars.
[01:15:31.610 --> 01:15:34.970]  I did a little preservation and I bred them all together
[01:15:34.970 --> 01:15:36.770]  and so I can make more seed.
[01:15:36.770 --> 01:15:40.690]  And then I crossed it with a few things in the meantime,
[01:15:40.690 --> 01:15:41.530]  you know what I mean?
[01:15:41.530 --> 01:15:42.410]  And made a couple of things.
[01:15:42.410 --> 01:15:45.970]  So used a couple of females, used a couple of males,
[01:15:45.970 --> 01:15:48.610]  did a couple of, you know, did a couple of different
[01:15:48.610 --> 01:15:52.930]  projects with the line because I figured adding that pine
[01:15:52.930 --> 01:15:56.890]  to a lot of those other fruity things and funky things
[01:15:56.890 --> 01:16:01.130]  and gassy things would really, really make some incredible,
[01:16:01.130 --> 01:16:02.890]  incredible plants, you know?
[01:16:02.890 --> 01:16:06.730]  And everything that, like you said, the cool ranch
[01:16:06.730 --> 01:16:11.730]  and a couple of the other pine tar crosses were all hits
[01:16:12.410 --> 01:16:13.770]  and I didn't make a whole bunch of them.
[01:16:13.770 --> 01:16:17.370]  So it's like, man, I should have made a whole bunch of those.
[01:16:17.410 --> 01:16:18.610]  You know, you never know which ones people
[01:16:18.610 --> 01:16:21.050]  are gonna like the most, you know?
[01:16:21.050 --> 01:16:24.130]  Is there like, is there a flavor or like,
[01:16:24.130 --> 01:16:25.610]  is there a trait that you're like,
[01:16:25.610 --> 01:16:28.010]  oh, I thought that would mix in really well?
[01:16:28.010 --> 01:16:31.410]  Or do you have like, I love hearing about a shitty
[01:16:31.410 --> 01:16:34.330]  fucking experiment that went poorly
[01:16:34.330 --> 01:16:37.170]  and I would love to hear about a failure of yours.
[01:16:37.170 --> 01:16:40.330]  I mean, like everybody's got them.
[01:16:41.290 --> 01:16:43.170]  I've got plants with yellow leaves.
[01:16:43.170 --> 01:16:45.330]  I'm sure you have one, a couple too.
[01:16:46.250 --> 01:16:47.810]  If you're willing to share it,
[01:16:47.810 --> 01:16:49.650]  I would love to hear about it
[01:16:49.650 --> 01:16:52.490]  and how you learned and moved forward.
[01:16:53.890 --> 01:16:56.850]  I'm sorry to be like the interviewer style dude,
[01:16:56.850 --> 01:16:59.850]  but I fucking, we got the opportunity.
[01:16:59.850 --> 01:17:00.690]  So I was hoping to bring it.
[01:17:00.690 --> 01:17:02.690]  There's a billion mistakes, you know,
[01:17:02.690 --> 01:17:06.130]  that you make over time.
[01:17:06.130 --> 01:17:09.650]  You know, I've made the most radical crosses
[01:17:09.650 --> 01:17:13.970]  with elite parents and gotten thousands of seeds
[01:17:13.970 --> 01:17:16.730]  and then put the seeds away too early
[01:17:16.730 --> 01:17:19.770]  and then opened up the bag like a month later
[01:17:19.770 --> 01:17:23.930]  to white fungus coated seeds
[01:17:23.930 --> 01:17:25.570]  that have just rotted in the bag.
[01:17:25.570 --> 01:17:26.410]  You know what I mean?
[01:17:26.410 --> 01:17:28.930]  Like just completely lost the lineage,
[01:17:28.930 --> 01:17:31.370]  don't have the parents anymore,
[01:17:31.370 --> 01:17:33.570]  frigging had everything set up perfectly
[01:17:33.570 --> 01:17:36.930]  and just fucking completely wasted all the time
[01:17:36.930 --> 01:17:38.570]  that it took to grow those plants,
[01:17:38.570 --> 01:17:41.570]  to seed them, to get it all to the point,
[01:17:41.570 --> 01:17:43.010]  to shock them, to get on
[01:17:43.010 --> 01:17:46.930]  and then have them just frigging be just null,
[01:17:46.930 --> 01:17:48.650]  which is why I brought the whole thing up
[01:17:48.650 --> 01:17:51.810]  about making sure you air dry those son of a bitches
[01:17:51.810 --> 01:17:52.850]  for a little while longer.
[01:17:52.850 --> 01:17:56.970]  Oh fuck, you never did not did that again, eh?
[01:17:56.970 --> 01:18:00.530]  You like went out and bought screens just for that.
[01:18:00.530 --> 01:18:04.410]  You might fuck up a real big deal.
[01:18:04.410 --> 01:18:06.970]  And that's something that really hurt.
[01:18:06.970 --> 01:18:08.530]  You know, I have, you know,
[01:18:09.530 --> 01:18:12.250]  I've gotten root aphids in a couple of plants.
[01:18:12.250 --> 01:18:15.010]  Because that's like months and months of work, right?
[01:18:15.010 --> 01:18:17.370]  And prepped it, like you gotta prep everything up.
[01:18:17.370 --> 01:18:18.850]  You gotta get plants through their vet.
[01:18:18.850 --> 01:18:22.930]  Like in the margins that like we live in,
[01:18:22.930 --> 01:18:24.650]  like just trying to take care of your family
[01:18:24.650 --> 01:18:26.490]  is not fucking easy nowadays.
[01:18:26.490 --> 01:18:27.930]  Man, I did, like I said,
[01:18:27.930 --> 01:18:31.010]  it was like one of the things that I did like right.
[01:18:31.010 --> 01:18:33.890]  Like I really did it right.
[01:18:33.890 --> 01:18:36.970]  Like I got a good quantity of the seed,
[01:18:36.970 --> 01:18:39.170]  everything went perfect timing,
[01:18:39.170 --> 01:18:40.930]  plan for a fucking healthy thing,
[01:18:40.930 --> 01:18:42.930]  we've dried, you know, on time.
[01:18:42.930 --> 01:18:44.810]  Everything was just fucking top notch.
[01:18:44.810 --> 01:18:46.850]  And then I just made that one last mistake
[01:18:46.850 --> 01:18:48.930]  where I was just a little bit too eager.
[01:18:48.930 --> 01:18:49.770]  You know what I mean?
[01:18:49.770 --> 01:18:51.250]  To just bag it up and seal it up.
[01:18:51.250 --> 01:18:52.090]  You know what I mean?
[01:18:52.090 --> 01:18:53.290]  And just call it a day.
[01:18:53.290 --> 01:18:55.450]  And that one little thing, like I said,
[01:18:55.450 --> 01:18:58.930]  just that it just, it wiped out thousands of seeds.
[01:18:58.930 --> 01:18:59.770]  You know what I mean?
[01:18:59.770 --> 01:19:01.650]  That could have done a lot of things, you know,
[01:19:01.650 --> 01:19:02.810]  could have done a lot of charities,
[01:19:02.810 --> 01:19:04.610]  could have gone to a lot of places.
[01:19:04.610 --> 01:19:06.810]  It could have been the next cookies in there, you know?
[01:19:07.650 --> 01:19:08.490]  Yeah, that's what I mean.
[01:19:08.490 --> 01:19:09.330]  You know what I mean?
[01:19:09.330 --> 01:19:10.490]  I mean a little sarcastic there.
[01:19:10.490 --> 01:19:14.490]  But most respectful way, I did not mean that.
[01:19:14.490 --> 01:19:16.490]  No, totally, totally, totally, no.
[01:19:17.650 --> 01:19:20.090]  But yeah, so that was one that hurt.
[01:19:20.090 --> 01:19:21.850]  And then, you know, I've gotten bug stuff
[01:19:21.850 --> 01:19:24.130]  that's killed like elite males.
[01:19:24.130 --> 01:19:28.690]  I lost a Mr. Frosty citrus farmer male
[01:19:28.690 --> 01:19:32.530]  that was just resin coated, excellent branching,
[01:19:32.530 --> 01:19:35.850]  stout and beautiful, past purple and resin.
[01:19:35.890 --> 01:19:37.690]  And just like this-
[01:19:37.690 --> 01:19:39.490]  Can I get your opinion on males?
[01:19:39.490 --> 01:19:40.690]  Like what's your, what's your,
[01:19:40.690 --> 01:19:42.010]  cause I've like, I've had,
[01:19:42.010 --> 01:19:44.050]  I've heard so many varied topics
[01:19:44.050 --> 01:19:46.930]  and it seems to be just dependent on the breeders style
[01:19:46.930 --> 01:19:48.810]  is what I've kind of noticed.
[01:19:48.810 --> 01:19:51.010]  Some are like, yeah, it's all about pristine,
[01:19:51.010 --> 01:19:52.930]  finding these super pristine males.
[01:19:52.930 --> 01:19:55.490]  Like I have a buddy who forest farms
[01:19:55.490 --> 01:19:58.130]  out in Southern Ontario and he's got a male
[01:19:58.130 --> 01:20:01.210]  that was selected out of like 10 fucking thousands.
[01:20:01.210 --> 01:20:03.850]  And it's like this one elite male cut.
[01:20:03.850 --> 01:20:07.210]  And he's like, like his big, one of his big things.
[01:20:07.210 --> 01:20:09.450]  And it's just like, and then I hear people say
[01:20:09.450 --> 01:20:11.730]  like Ryan Laird, he's like, well, you know,
[01:20:11.730 --> 01:20:13.970]  like the men don't carry any of the traits
[01:20:13.970 --> 01:20:15.970]  that I fucking care about.
[01:20:15.970 --> 01:20:17.810]  The women are the ones that carry the traits.
[01:20:17.810 --> 01:20:19.930]  It's like, oh, you can find the elite male,
[01:20:19.930 --> 01:20:21.330]  but does it really fucking matter?
[01:20:21.330 --> 01:20:22.610]  Like, it's just like,
[01:20:22.610 --> 01:20:25.610]  so what's your thought process there?
[01:20:25.610 --> 01:20:29.810]  So there's no such thing as like one male
[01:20:29.810 --> 01:20:31.890]  that's like the best male of them all, you know?
[01:20:31.930 --> 01:20:34.650]  Like every project has its own thing
[01:20:34.650 --> 01:20:36.170]  and it's like a really general statement,
[01:20:36.170 --> 01:20:39.850]  but every project has its own, you know, reason,
[01:20:39.850 --> 01:20:42.490]  like an open pollination for the candahars, right?
[01:20:42.490 --> 01:20:44.770]  I wanted to use all the males that were there
[01:20:44.770 --> 01:20:47.170]  because maybe one of those maritals carried something
[01:20:47.170 --> 01:20:48.970]  that the other ones didn't.
[01:20:48.970 --> 01:20:52.930]  Keeps a good, you know, spread of genetic material.
[01:20:52.930 --> 01:20:56.250]  The more that I had there, the more, you know,
[01:20:56.250 --> 01:20:58.530]  the snapshot that I could capture in my mind,
[01:20:58.530 --> 01:20:59.370]  you know what I mean?
[01:20:59.650 --> 01:21:01.970]  By using more variety in there.
[01:21:02.930 --> 01:21:05.530]  And then there's like males, like the resin male
[01:21:05.530 --> 01:21:08.730]  that I held and my pandemic resin male
[01:21:08.730 --> 01:21:10.130]  that I held for a long time.
[01:21:11.810 --> 01:21:13.970]  Those were just weird anomaly plants
[01:21:13.970 --> 01:21:16.770]  that turned out to be like superstars.
[01:21:16.770 --> 01:21:19.850]  They were like just a male that really looked amazing
[01:21:19.850 --> 01:21:22.130]  from the start and like had elite characteristics
[01:21:22.130 --> 01:21:23.930]  from the start and then showed up
[01:21:23.930 --> 01:21:28.530]  and ended up like flashing resin, like a female would,
[01:21:28.530 --> 01:21:29.370]  you know what I mean?
[01:21:29.370 --> 01:21:33.290]  Without throwing hairs and it was like a true male plant
[01:21:33.290 --> 01:21:35.210]  that would produce resin, you know what I mean?
[01:21:35.210 --> 01:21:39.330]  And I had a couple of those and those were cool
[01:21:39.330 --> 01:21:41.810]  and you wanted to breed with those because, you know,
[01:21:41.810 --> 01:21:42.970]  you don't see that all the time.
[01:21:42.970 --> 01:21:46.090]  And the more males that would have resin
[01:21:46.090 --> 01:21:49.250]  might throw more resin onto the progeny.
[01:21:49.250 --> 01:21:50.690]  It might just be one of those traits.
[01:21:50.690 --> 01:21:52.050]  I mean, it's something that would be cool
[01:21:52.050 --> 01:21:54.610]  and you would be crazy to not use a male like that.
[01:21:55.850 --> 01:21:58.330]  But I like using these days.
[01:21:59.290 --> 01:22:02.610]  If I was just gonna pop like, you know,
[01:22:02.610 --> 01:22:07.330]  10 seeds or 100 seeds or 200 seeds or whatever,
[01:22:07.330 --> 01:22:11.250]  I would use a few males in a breeding population
[01:22:11.250 --> 01:22:13.690]  just to keep a bigger snapshot of it.
[01:22:13.690 --> 01:22:16.010]  I would pick the best ones in my opinion
[01:22:16.010 --> 01:22:17.650]  that kind of gave good representation.
[01:22:17.650 --> 01:22:20.330]  Sometimes you could pick something
[01:22:20.330 --> 01:22:22.130]  where they all look the same
[01:22:22.130 --> 01:22:24.410]  and you're trying to go for some sort of a look
[01:22:24.410 --> 01:22:27.570]  or maybe this look leans toward a certain profile.
[01:22:27.730 --> 01:22:30.610]  Like this one is always, this leaf shape always,
[01:22:30.610 --> 01:22:33.370]  you know, makes OG turps, you notice.
[01:22:33.370 --> 01:22:36.410]  In more cases than not, if it has this leaf shape,
[01:22:36.410 --> 01:22:39.170]  the females with this leaf shape make OG turps,
[01:22:39.170 --> 01:22:41.730]  then you look for the males that have that leaf shape
[01:22:41.730 --> 01:22:44.370]  and hopefully those males are sending those OG turps.
[01:22:44.370 --> 01:22:47.250]  You could just segregate things like that
[01:22:47.250 --> 01:22:48.850]  or you could pick a variety of things
[01:22:48.850 --> 01:22:52.010]  where you pick one tall male, one short male,
[01:22:52.010 --> 01:22:54.330]  one squatty male, one branchy male,
[01:22:54.330 --> 01:22:55.530]  and then you use all of them
[01:22:55.570 --> 01:22:58.090]  to kind of capture the different profiles that way.
[01:22:58.090 --> 01:23:01.290]  And I've done all of the above, you know.
[01:23:01.290 --> 01:23:04.690]  There's no one way that's better than another, I think.
[01:23:04.690 --> 01:23:08.290]  I think that they're all just useful in different ways
[01:23:09.690 --> 01:23:12.930]  and cool to kind of chase down different rabbit holes
[01:23:12.930 --> 01:23:14.210]  and figure out, you know.
[01:23:14.210 --> 01:23:15.850]  But that's why I like the Pam so much
[01:23:15.850 --> 01:23:19.570]  because whatever I crossed to the Pam,
[01:23:19.570 --> 01:23:22.290]  I've grown the Pam for so long that-
[01:23:22.290 --> 01:23:23.130]  You know exactly what's gonna come out of it, eh?
[01:23:23.130 --> 01:23:25.050]  They tell me exactly what the male contributed,
[01:23:25.330 --> 01:23:29.250]  how strong was his traits, what did he bring over,
[01:23:29.250 --> 01:23:32.930]  how much did he change the Pam overall,
[01:23:32.930 --> 01:23:35.170]  and where did the changes occur?
[01:23:35.170 --> 01:23:36.810]  And then that tells me right away,
[01:23:36.810 --> 01:23:39.210]  okay, well, this male is more likely to do this.
[01:23:39.210 --> 01:23:41.490]  And then when I grow out other things,
[01:23:41.490 --> 01:23:45.250]  you see that more common than others
[01:23:45.250 --> 01:23:48.490]  just from kind of looking at a kind of a calibration.
[01:23:48.490 --> 01:23:51.330]  But there's no right male.
[01:23:51.330 --> 01:23:54.250]  It's kind of what you're trying to do.
[01:23:54.970 --> 01:23:56.930]  How many years have you had the Pam?
[01:24:00.930 --> 01:24:03.970]  Just so I can look forward to an understanding
[01:24:03.970 --> 01:24:05.570]  of a plant like yourself.
[01:24:05.570 --> 01:24:09.490]  I popped her mother's seed in 2000, the end of 2013.
[01:24:12.170 --> 01:24:13.570]  Coming up to 10 years.
[01:24:13.570 --> 01:24:15.370]  Yeah, I selected it the next year
[01:24:15.370 --> 01:24:18.530]  out of the seeds that mama gave me.
[01:24:18.530 --> 01:24:21.890]  So 2014, so yeah, since 2014, so almost 10 years.
[01:24:21.930 --> 01:24:23.770]  Between the seven, eight years now
[01:24:23.770 --> 01:24:25.730]  for the Pam since they've been around.
[01:24:26.890 --> 01:24:29.930]  Those seeds, we've been traveling around with me
[01:24:29.930 --> 01:24:34.930]  since I started that little jug in 99.
[01:24:37.570 --> 01:24:42.570]  And I think I packed it away somewhere in 2003 or 2004.
[01:24:43.210 --> 01:24:44.770]  So those seeds could have come from,
[01:24:44.770 --> 01:24:48.570]  the original ones were somewhere from that little period,
[01:24:48.570 --> 01:24:50.170]  that little snapshot.
[01:24:50.250 --> 01:24:55.250]  Not incredibly old, but pretty old by today's standards.
[01:24:56.290 --> 01:24:59.370]  Definitely different than what we smoke today.
[01:25:01.850 --> 01:25:05.370]  So I would, we're starting out,
[01:25:05.370 --> 01:25:06.970]  we've been going an hour and a half.
[01:25:06.970 --> 01:25:09.450]  So I don't wanna go too hard.
[01:25:09.450 --> 01:25:10.650]  I mean, I could go for hours
[01:25:10.650 --> 01:25:12.050]  and just pick your brain for a while,
[01:25:12.050 --> 01:25:14.610]  but you would lose all of the information
[01:25:14.610 --> 01:25:18.050]  that we're gonna give forward in the other episodes.
[01:25:18.050 --> 01:25:20.290]  I would love to understand a little bit
[01:25:20.290 --> 01:25:22.650]  about your selection process
[01:25:22.650 --> 01:25:27.050]  kind of for what we're gonna get to play with later on
[01:25:27.050 --> 01:25:30.410]  and what's gonna happen there and how you went about it.
[01:25:30.410 --> 01:25:35.410]  Your ice cream cakes, the fatter, squattier leaves
[01:25:37.210 --> 01:25:39.250]  in general, like the more round leaves,
[01:25:39.250 --> 01:25:42.390]  the more compact leaves are gonna be,
[01:25:44.370 --> 01:25:46.410]  those are my type.
[01:25:46.410 --> 01:25:48.890]  A lot of the types that came out of those little round,
[01:25:48.890 --> 01:25:52.370]  more compact, really tight nodes,
[01:25:52.370 --> 01:25:55.330]  heavy indica kind of leaning with rounder leaves
[01:25:55.330 --> 01:25:56.770]  that are not big leaves per se.
[01:25:56.770 --> 01:25:57.770]  Once they get into the flower,
[01:25:57.770 --> 01:25:59.250]  they're actually kind of on the small side,
[01:25:59.250 --> 01:26:02.610]  more along the ice cream cake kind of look.
[01:26:02.610 --> 01:26:06.690]  Those are some cool, really good flavor plants,
[01:26:06.690 --> 01:26:11.690]  kind of cakey with a little extra funkiness in there
[01:26:12.330 --> 01:26:15.650]  that's just real delicious on the back end,
[01:26:15.650 --> 01:26:17.770]  which is kind of what I'm going for.
[01:26:17.770 --> 01:26:20.850]  I saw several of those kind of come through
[01:26:20.850 --> 01:26:23.010]  and you're like, oh, that looks more
[01:26:23.010 --> 01:26:24.890]  like the ice cream cake leaf,
[01:26:24.890 --> 01:26:26.530]  you know what I mean, in growth.
[01:26:26.530 --> 01:26:28.730]  And I don't know if you guys have grown the clone
[01:26:28.730 --> 01:26:30.570]  or seen the plant or the cake,
[01:26:30.570 --> 01:26:35.130]  but it has a little, a leaf that you can kind of look
[01:26:35.130 --> 01:26:40.130]  and measure and it's more of this roundy leaf kind of shape
[01:26:40.290 --> 01:26:45.290]  with that candahar really brought the nodes really close
[01:26:45.370 --> 01:26:46.890]  and made them really squatty.
[01:26:46.890 --> 01:26:49.010]  And you can top them and get them to branch
[01:26:49.010 --> 01:26:50.170]  a little bit better, you know,
[01:26:50.170 --> 01:26:52.050]  and they literally look nice that way.
[01:26:52.050 --> 01:26:56.490]  But those were tough plants, but I liked those a lot,
[01:26:56.490 --> 01:26:57.930]  you know, and there were some really,
[01:26:57.930 --> 01:27:02.930]  some sharper garbage turps, you know,
[01:27:03.050 --> 01:27:05.610]  like a dumpster or something like that, you know,
[01:27:05.610 --> 01:27:10.090]  with a little pointier leaf that I saw a few of
[01:27:10.090 --> 01:27:11.350]  in those cakes too.
[01:27:12.250 --> 01:27:13.550]  I didn't get a smoke any of that,
[01:27:13.550 --> 01:27:16.990]  but it was different on the rancid side, you know,
[01:27:16.990 --> 01:27:18.670]  it was like the other one was more meaty
[01:27:18.670 --> 01:27:22.750]  and more like just kind of fouled.
[01:27:22.750 --> 01:27:24.070]  Will it piss off my neighbor?
[01:27:24.070 --> 01:27:25.390]  Cause I'm good with that.
[01:27:25.390 --> 01:27:28.310]  I'm good with a little bit of pissing off my neighbor.
[01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:29.910]  They might not, you know, yeah.
[01:27:29.910 --> 01:27:31.830]  They might not like it very much.
[01:27:31.830 --> 01:27:32.670]  Okay, cool.
[01:27:34.790 --> 01:27:38.630]  I was hoping, you know, there's a couple that we have,
[01:27:38.630 --> 01:27:40.830]  a couple of the SFVs that are like,
[01:27:40.830 --> 01:27:42.590]  it's like there's a dead rat in the wall,
[01:27:42.590 --> 01:27:43.430]  you know what I mean?
[01:27:43.430 --> 01:27:44.270]  Like, it's like-
[01:27:44.270 --> 01:27:45.590]  Oh, I've had a dead rat in the wall.
[01:27:45.590 --> 01:27:46.510]  I don't want that.
[01:27:46.510 --> 01:27:48.350]  I don't want that at all.
[01:27:48.350 --> 01:27:50.590]  That's gonna piss off more than the neighbor.
[01:27:50.590 --> 01:27:51.430]  Is that good?
[01:27:51.430 --> 01:27:52.750]  And you, but it's one of those things
[01:27:52.750 --> 01:27:55.030]  where you like smell it and you're like, oh,
[01:27:55.030 --> 01:27:56.750]  and then you're like, oh, I'm gonna smell it again.
[01:27:56.750 --> 01:27:58.870]  Oh, and you just keep doing that.
[01:27:58.870 --> 01:28:00.670]  You're like in that loop, you know what I mean?
[01:28:00.670 --> 01:28:02.510]  Where you're like, you can't really believe
[01:28:02.510 --> 01:28:04.830]  kind of what you're, you know, it's weird.
[01:28:04.830 --> 01:28:05.670]  I don't know.
[01:28:05.670 --> 01:28:06.490]  It's that one's weird.
[01:28:06.490 --> 01:28:07.330]  I don't know if I'm gonna like it or not,
[01:28:07.330 --> 01:28:09.030]  but that's kind of what I'm looking at.
[01:28:09.030 --> 01:28:12.450]  You know, I'm looking for funky things like that.
[01:28:13.230 --> 01:28:15.570]  But with the cake, I really wanted that ice cream cake.
[01:28:15.570 --> 01:28:17.370]  So really good batch of ice cream cake
[01:28:17.370 --> 01:28:18.650]  is really good fucking pot.
[01:28:18.650 --> 01:28:19.490]  You know what I mean?
[01:28:19.490 --> 01:28:22.010]  If you get it really good, it can be really tasty.
[01:28:22.010 --> 01:28:24.170]  It's really frosty.
[01:28:24.170 --> 01:28:25.810]  It's got those types of appeals.
[01:28:25.810 --> 01:28:28.330]  And I just kind of wanted to nasty it up a little bit,
[01:28:28.330 --> 01:28:29.450]  you know, on that back end,
[01:28:29.450 --> 01:28:32.170]  because you got that dough or that cake turf
[01:28:32.170 --> 01:28:34.410]  or whatever you want to call it, you know, on that back end.
[01:28:34.410 --> 01:28:36.450]  If you get a good batch of it
[01:28:36.450 --> 01:28:40.330]  and it's that earthy, that kush type turf.
[01:28:40.330 --> 01:28:43.170]  And I was hoping to kind of influence that
[01:28:43.170 --> 01:28:44.450]  in there with that sparkle.
[01:28:44.450 --> 01:28:45.290]  You know what I mean?
[01:28:45.290 --> 01:28:47.130]  Make the candor and bring some of that stank,
[01:28:47.130 --> 01:28:49.430]  that rancidness over.
[01:28:49.430 --> 01:28:51.970]  So if you find something that's kind of cookie
[01:28:51.970 --> 01:28:53.490]  with a little extra funk, you know,
[01:28:53.490 --> 01:28:55.290]  that's what I'm going for, you know.
[01:28:57.210 --> 01:28:58.930]  I'm very excited.
[01:28:58.930 --> 01:29:01.050]  And what about, what was the cross that you got,
[01:29:01.050 --> 01:29:02.730]  Corey, there as well?
[01:29:02.730 --> 01:29:05.170]  I got the SFV, which sounds like
[01:29:05.170 --> 01:29:07.090]  I'm gonna have a dead rat in the wall pretty soon.
[01:29:07.090 --> 01:29:10.930]  No, it was a couple of those.
[01:29:10.930 --> 01:29:11.770]  It wasn't all of them.
[01:29:11.770 --> 01:29:13.970]  It was just a couple of funky standouts
[01:29:13.970 --> 01:29:15.650]  that got an extra little,
[01:29:15.650 --> 01:29:18.370]  they got an extra little tag just for, you know.
[01:29:18.370 --> 01:29:20.570]  So if I'm lucky, I'm gonna get that.
[01:29:20.570 --> 01:29:21.410]  No, no, no.
[01:29:21.410 --> 01:29:23.250]  Never forget that smell of a dead rat in the wall.
[01:29:23.250 --> 01:29:25.210]  It's just an interesting turf, you know what I mean?
[01:29:25.210 --> 01:29:28.130]  It's got, you gotta kind of pay a notice to it.
[01:29:28.130 --> 01:29:31.050]  It's like the loop, you know, you get caught in the loop.
[01:29:31.050 --> 01:29:31.890]  It's so weird.
[01:29:31.890 --> 01:29:32.930]  It's good.
[01:29:32.930 --> 01:29:35.210]  It's good in a bad way, you know what I mean?
[01:29:35.210 --> 01:29:36.050]  I do.
[01:29:36.050 --> 01:29:37.850]  The SFV is so stringent.
[01:29:37.850 --> 01:29:39.370]  It's one of my favorite smokes, man.
[01:29:39.370 --> 01:29:42.210]  It's like the first jar empty, that SFV,
[01:29:42.210 --> 01:29:44.290]  and you know, the Dog Walker,
[01:29:44.290 --> 01:29:47.850]  and you know, then you get into the cakes
[01:29:47.850 --> 01:29:49.570]  and the PAMs and all those other ones
[01:29:49.570 --> 01:29:50.850]  I started getting into after that.
[01:29:50.850 --> 01:29:52.450]  But the SFV always goes first.
[01:29:52.450 --> 01:29:54.290]  It's one of my first ones to go.
[01:29:54.290 --> 01:29:59.050]  And it is powerful, real deal OG, you know what I mean?
[01:29:59.050 --> 01:30:01.770]  Really stringent, really fucking beautiful,
[01:30:02.650 --> 01:30:06.290]  just fucking delicious and just powerful pot,
[01:30:06.290 --> 01:30:07.130]  you know what I mean?
[01:30:07.130 --> 01:30:10.530]  Just the way it should be, you know, really pointy nugs.
[01:30:10.530 --> 01:30:11.890]  So a lot of the nugs structure
[01:30:11.890 --> 01:30:13.090]  are gonna be really, really dense
[01:30:13.090 --> 01:30:14.450]  because you got a lot of that already,
[01:30:14.450 --> 01:30:18.890]  but I noticed a lot more of those SFV type pointy nugs
[01:30:18.890 --> 01:30:21.410]  that they get, and you'll know what I mean when I say it,
[01:30:21.410 --> 01:30:23.930]  you know, it's kind of pineconey and pointy
[01:30:23.930 --> 01:30:25.370]  and really, really dense.
[01:30:27.410 --> 01:30:29.290]  Excellent resonant on those, but yeah,
[01:30:29.290 --> 01:30:31.130]  you're gonna find some power in there.
[01:30:31.450 --> 01:30:33.450]  There'll be power in there for sure.
[01:30:33.450 --> 01:30:35.970]  So like, how are these for washing?
[01:30:35.970 --> 01:30:37.690]  Like, have you washed much of this
[01:30:37.690 --> 01:30:40.210]  or are you mainly a flour guy or?
[01:30:40.210 --> 01:30:42.010]  Yeah, I haven't washed any
[01:30:42.010 --> 01:30:44.050]  and I haven't gotten any reports on washing.
[01:30:44.050 --> 01:30:45.130]  And what are you smoking on?
[01:30:45.130 --> 01:30:45.970]  We haven't even like,
[01:30:45.970 --> 01:30:48.610]  what is Mr. Tree smoking on this evening?
[01:30:48.610 --> 01:30:50.930]  I'm smoking PAM 15 right now, actually.
[01:30:53.330 --> 01:30:55.850]  I've been smoking PAM 15 chunks here.
[01:30:55.850 --> 01:30:58.450]  I got a little Dixie cup
[01:30:58.450 --> 01:31:00.610]  with a couple of little shards left of a giant nug.
[01:31:01.130 --> 01:31:02.170]  I grabbed a giant nug when I was in here
[01:31:02.170 --> 01:31:05.210]  and I've been puffing away on my pipe.
[01:31:06.170 --> 01:31:10.090]  But yeah, I still got some outdoor PAM 15
[01:31:10.090 --> 01:31:11.610]  from this past season.
[01:31:12.450 --> 01:31:14.130]  It's fucking killer, you know what I mean?
[01:31:14.130 --> 01:31:15.930]  I really enjoy smoking it.
[01:31:15.930 --> 01:31:19.850]  We were at Peter's event in Venice
[01:31:19.850 --> 01:31:23.130]  and we had the Rasta band and a bunch of people came out.
[01:31:23.130 --> 01:31:26.530]  You know what, like, can you just get less likable, please?
[01:31:26.530 --> 01:31:28.810]  Like, this is pissing me off right now.
[01:31:28.850 --> 01:31:31.890]  You're like, it's always warm here.
[01:31:31.890 --> 01:31:33.730]  I plant stuff all year long.
[01:31:33.730 --> 01:31:35.010]  No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[01:31:36.010 --> 01:31:37.570]  Yeah, we were sitting outside.
[01:31:37.570 --> 01:31:38.810]  There was people hanging out.
[01:31:38.810 --> 01:31:40.690]  There was reggae music playing.
[01:31:40.690 --> 01:31:41.530]  It was really cool.
[01:31:41.530 --> 01:31:42.930]  But you know, it was the,
[01:31:42.930 --> 01:31:47.770]  I think it was the trombone player, the tuba player.
[01:31:47.770 --> 01:31:48.770]  I don't want to get that right.
[01:31:48.770 --> 01:31:51.890]  He was cool as hell, but he was, he came over
[01:31:51.890 --> 01:31:54.170]  and out of all the stuff that was sitting on the table,
[01:31:54.170 --> 01:31:56.770]  he picked the PAM 15, you know, to blaze.
[01:31:56.770 --> 01:31:58.690]  He enjoyed that, which is really cool.
[01:31:59.570 --> 01:32:00.410]  I was like, oh, that's cool.
[01:32:00.410 --> 01:32:02.570]  You know, so I even had some shit that was better than that
[01:32:02.570 --> 01:32:04.570]  that I was like, man, I'd smoke that, you know, right there.
[01:32:04.570 --> 01:32:05.810]  But he's like, no, I want this.
[01:32:05.810 --> 01:32:08.010]  I was like, hey, I'm gonna tell you twice.
[01:32:08.010 --> 01:32:09.050]  That's cool.
[01:32:09.050 --> 01:32:11.490]  Sometimes it's just like it draws you.
[01:32:11.490 --> 01:32:13.890]  Like it pulls you in.
[01:32:13.890 --> 01:32:15.610]  Haze goodness, you know?
[01:32:15.610 --> 01:32:18.370]  It's very, very nice.
[01:32:18.370 --> 01:32:20.250]  But that's what I'm smoking on right now.
[01:32:22.250 --> 01:32:23.370]  What about you, Corey?
[01:32:24.130 --> 01:32:28.690]  Unfortunately, my tents are in the garage,
[01:32:28.690 --> 01:32:31.130]  which is where I smoke and it's lights out time.
[01:32:31.130 --> 01:32:32.290]  I'm afraid of leaks.
[01:32:32.290 --> 01:32:35.410]  So I'm in the basement and I've eaten an edible,
[01:32:35.410 --> 01:32:38.610]  which yeah, I'm enjoying quite well.
[01:32:39.690 --> 01:32:41.610]  Did you prepare them yourself?
[01:32:41.610 --> 01:32:43.610]  Are you, do you do edibles?
[01:32:43.610 --> 01:32:44.570]  I do, I do.
[01:32:44.570 --> 01:32:49.570]  I'm either, I'll either smoke or I'll do edibles.
[01:32:49.770 --> 01:32:53.810]  And when I mix, it's usually, yeah, it's a lot.
[01:32:53.810 --> 01:32:55.530]  But yeah, I make them myself.
[01:32:55.530 --> 01:32:58.570]  I make blueberry muffins, little mini muffins.
[01:32:58.570 --> 01:33:01.330]  And I just, I dose them accordingly.
[01:33:01.330 --> 01:33:03.810]  You know, every batch is a little different.
[01:33:03.810 --> 01:33:05.650]  Oh, that's cool.
[01:33:05.650 --> 01:33:08.370]  Yeah, I'll take some Tootsie Rolls.
[01:33:08.370 --> 01:33:10.730]  You know, I found like, I just take some Tootsie Rolls
[01:33:10.730 --> 01:33:13.770]  and I'll melt some Tootsie Rolls in a little pan.
[01:33:13.770 --> 01:33:16.690]  And then I'll put in some key for some rosin
[01:33:16.690 --> 01:33:18.210]  or whatever I have, you know what I mean?
[01:33:18.250 --> 01:33:19.090]  And I'll take a little bit at a time
[01:33:19.090 --> 01:33:20.930]  and I'll stir it into the melted Tootsie Rolls.
[01:33:20.930 --> 01:33:22.810]  And then I put those Tootsie Rolls
[01:33:22.810 --> 01:33:26.170]  on a little piece of parchment paper and roll it back up.
[01:33:26.170 --> 01:33:28.290]  And it hardens right up really, really quick.
[01:33:28.290 --> 01:33:30.370]  And then you can break off pieces of the Tootsie Roll
[01:33:30.370 --> 01:33:32.250]  and I suck on those puppies every once in a while.
[01:33:32.250 --> 01:33:35.010]  So that's kind of what I have every once in a while.
[01:33:35.010 --> 01:33:37.490]  It's just quick and it works, man.
[01:33:37.490 --> 01:33:38.650]  I love Tootsie Rolls.
[01:33:38.650 --> 01:33:40.290]  I fucking love Tootsie Rolls.
[01:33:40.290 --> 01:33:41.370]  They're like, there's that candy
[01:33:41.370 --> 01:33:42.410]  that nobody liked as a kid.
[01:33:42.410 --> 01:33:43.530]  I was like, yeah, give me that.
[01:33:43.530 --> 01:33:45.970]  I want fucking, I want this fucking Tootsie Rolls.
[01:33:45.970 --> 01:33:48.010]  Like, my mom would eat that.
[01:33:48.770 --> 01:33:49.610]  My mother, she's like an ex-cop.
[01:33:49.610 --> 01:33:51.370]  She'd like, she'd totally eat the shit out of that
[01:33:51.370 --> 01:33:52.730]  because it's Tootsie Rolls.
[01:33:52.730 --> 01:33:53.970]  Fucking be hilarious.
[01:33:56.290 --> 01:33:57.610]  Advantage of living in Canada
[01:33:57.610 --> 01:33:59.610]  is the cops can smoke now, which is great.
[01:33:59.610 --> 01:34:04.130]  Makes things a little bit fucking easier.
[01:34:06.010 --> 01:34:06.850]  Fuck, man.
[01:34:06.850 --> 01:34:10.210]  No, that sounds absolutely fucking epic.
[01:34:10.210 --> 01:34:13.330]  I'm really excited to see kind of what happens
[01:34:13.330 --> 01:34:14.930]  over the next little while here.
[01:34:14.930 --> 01:34:17.490]  Now we were talking earlier and I was,
[01:34:17.490 --> 01:34:18.370]  when it comes to cooking
[01:34:18.370 --> 01:34:21.130]  and I had the funniest thing happen earlier today.
[01:34:21.130 --> 01:34:22.690]  There was Dr. Mark.
[01:34:22.690 --> 01:34:24.170]  Did you guys see the show that happened earlier
[01:34:24.170 --> 01:34:25.010]  with Dr. Mark?
[01:34:25.010 --> 01:34:27.090]  He did the chemistry.
[01:34:27.090 --> 01:34:27.930]  No.
[01:34:27.930 --> 01:34:29.210]  Go check it out.
[01:34:29.210 --> 01:34:30.850]  It was pretty good.
[01:34:30.850 --> 01:34:33.810]  But he's like really crazy fucking smart.
[01:34:33.810 --> 01:34:34.650]  So I was chatting with him
[01:34:34.650 --> 01:34:39.650]  and we recently had our like hydrocarbon expert extractor guy
[01:34:39.810 --> 01:34:41.650]  kind of leave out of the group.
[01:34:41.650 --> 01:34:43.850]  So I was like, well, do you want to come join?
[01:34:43.850 --> 01:34:46.090]  I'm like, this week we're doing this cooking one.
[01:34:46.090 --> 01:34:47.410]  So we got this like cool recipe.
[01:34:48.290 --> 01:34:49.770]  And I found this local chef.
[01:34:49.770 --> 01:34:53.210]  She's a friend of mine and she's like Afro Caribbean food.
[01:34:53.210 --> 01:34:55.530]  And she does infused dining experiences.
[01:34:55.530 --> 01:34:56.650]  That's her thing.
[01:34:56.650 --> 01:34:59.490]  So I'm like, okay, let's do an episode of the Dank Hour
[01:34:59.490 --> 01:35:01.370]  which is like our weekly Tuesday night thing.
[01:35:01.370 --> 01:35:03.610]  Like let's do an episode of the Dank Hour
[01:35:03.610 --> 01:35:07.490]  and we'll get the recipe and we'll all make it.
[01:35:07.490 --> 01:35:09.490]  And we'll all like eat it.
[01:35:09.490 --> 01:35:11.930]  And then we'll like that's how we'll start the conversation
[01:35:11.930 --> 01:35:13.250]  on Tuesday.
[01:35:13.250 --> 01:35:14.250]  So you can check that.
[01:35:14.250 --> 01:35:15.530]  I've got it on the Instagram.
[01:35:15.530 --> 01:35:16.370]  It's fucking epic.
[01:35:16.850 --> 01:35:19.290]  You gotta do me a favor and make it.
[01:35:19.290 --> 01:35:21.290]  It's a beautiful blood orange salad.
[01:35:21.290 --> 01:35:23.410]  Like you'll fucking absolutely, ah, fuck.
[01:35:24.610 --> 01:35:25.450]  Like.
[01:35:27.730 --> 01:35:28.930]  Life of a grower.
[01:35:29.850 --> 01:35:31.850]  That happened to me at the beginning of the episode.
[01:35:31.850 --> 01:35:33.370]  Same thing, I was scammed.
[01:35:35.770 --> 01:35:36.610]  Fuck me.
[01:35:36.610 --> 01:35:37.450]  Never expected.
[01:35:37.450 --> 01:35:39.890]  You're like, I'll be out before it's over.
[01:35:39.890 --> 01:35:40.730]  I'll be long dead.
[01:35:40.730 --> 01:35:43.050]  It only goes 120 minutes.
[01:35:43.050 --> 01:35:44.690]  It won't go any longer than that.
[01:35:45.450 --> 01:35:49.730]  Every fucking episode that runs longer
[01:35:49.730 --> 01:35:52.490]  than an hour and 20 minutes, I get blasted in the face
[01:35:52.490 --> 01:35:53.330]  with fucking light.
[01:35:53.330 --> 01:35:54.770]  It's wonderful.
[01:35:54.770 --> 01:35:55.650]  No, I'm excited, man.
[01:35:55.650 --> 01:35:57.610]  I'm excited to see what you guys pull out, you know?
[01:35:57.610 --> 01:36:00.530]  And you know what happens and who, what survives
[01:36:00.530 --> 01:36:03.250]  and you know, who will make it to the end of the,
[01:36:03.250 --> 01:36:04.690]  end of the rainbow, you know?
[01:36:04.690 --> 01:36:06.530]  But there's some good,
[01:36:07.770 --> 01:36:11.010]  there's some good stuff to be found in there, you know?
[01:36:11.010 --> 01:36:13.610]  So I'm always trying to find that old,
[01:36:13.610 --> 01:36:16.210]  that old nasty, you know, that loud stuff.
[01:36:16.210 --> 01:36:17.410]  You know what I mean?
[01:36:17.410 --> 01:36:20.210]  It's like, holy shit, these people are smoking dank,
[01:36:20.210 --> 01:36:21.770]  you know, like loud, you know?
[01:36:21.770 --> 01:36:24.730]  Like, I don't, you know, maybe you don't want that
[01:36:24.730 --> 01:36:28.410]  where you are, but that's what I'm looking for, you know?
[01:36:28.410 --> 01:36:32.090]  So are all of these, are all of these on Dagga right now?
[01:36:32.090 --> 01:36:35.090]  All of these lines on Dagga that we're trying out?
[01:36:35.090 --> 01:36:37.090]  Yeah, there's a bunch of them, yeah.
[01:36:37.090 --> 01:36:38.690]  He was gonna put some up, so.
[01:36:38.690 --> 01:36:42.370]  So like people, people in the chat could like go to Dagga,
[01:36:42.370 --> 01:36:44.930]  like pick up the seeds and get them in dirt right now
[01:36:44.930 --> 01:36:46.970]  and do this like with us as we do it.
[01:36:46.970 --> 01:36:48.170]  Yeah, they can do it with us.
[01:36:48.170 --> 01:36:50.210]  You know, we're all, you know, you guys are starting,
[01:36:50.210 --> 01:36:52.610]  you saw, everybody saw how small they are, but yeah.
[01:36:52.610 --> 01:36:54.210]  There's some cool stuff to think there.
[01:36:54.210 --> 01:36:57.930]  He got some, he got some popcorn and he got,
[01:36:59.490 --> 01:37:02.090]  I think some more grapes and some other stuff too,
[01:37:02.090 --> 01:37:03.010]  which is pretty cool.
[01:37:03.010 --> 01:37:05.130]  So there'll be some more stuff up there too like that,
[01:37:05.130 --> 01:37:08.090]  you know, doing a bunch of different veggies and stuff.
[01:37:08.090 --> 01:37:09.810]  He's gonna get a bunch of those pretty soon too
[01:37:09.810 --> 01:37:12.450]  for spring time, it's just, yeah.
[01:37:13.290 --> 01:37:15.530]  So is your, one of your goals for this too
[01:37:15.530 --> 01:37:18.770]  was to kind of figure out like what representation
[01:37:18.770 --> 01:37:20.850]  and traits that the can, that the,
[01:37:20.850 --> 01:37:23.810]  I've made it the whole episode
[01:37:23.810 --> 01:37:25.770]  without having to say the name.
[01:37:25.770 --> 01:37:26.610]  Kandahar.
[01:37:26.610 --> 01:37:27.930]  Kandahar, Kandahar.
[01:37:27.930 --> 01:37:29.010]  He's got the Kandahar.
[01:37:29.010 --> 01:37:29.850]  The Kandahar.
[01:37:29.850 --> 01:37:32.410]  KMR, KMR, yeah, the KMR.
[01:37:32.410 --> 01:37:35.410]  That, like, are you, like the goal would be to find
[01:37:35.410 --> 01:37:36.890]  kind of the more consistent traits
[01:37:36.890 --> 01:37:38.250]  that come out of that mail?
[01:37:38.250 --> 01:37:39.930]  Yeah, yeah, that, yeah.
[01:37:39.930 --> 01:37:41.730]  Because I use multiple mails in there.
[01:37:41.730 --> 01:37:45.650]  I just wanna know what the consistent, you know,
[01:37:45.650 --> 01:37:48.210]  things throughout the crosses.
[01:37:48.210 --> 01:37:50.530]  Are they all just squatting plants in those ones?
[01:37:50.530 --> 01:37:54.250]  Are they, you know, are they notoriously rotten?
[01:37:54.250 --> 01:37:57.210]  How much, how much nice pleasant tones
[01:37:57.210 --> 01:37:58.210]  are coming out of there?
[01:37:58.210 --> 01:37:59.050]  You know what I mean?
[01:37:59.050 --> 01:37:59.890]  I guess the rotten.
[01:37:59.890 --> 01:38:00.730]  The dominant ratios and stuff.
[01:38:00.730 --> 01:38:02.970]  But I would expect the Kandahars to be pretty,
[01:38:04.370 --> 01:38:08.110]  pretty formidable in their impression on the offspring,
[01:38:08.970 --> 01:38:10.670]  which could be good, could be bad,
[01:38:11.630 --> 01:38:13.470]  depending on who likes the smells.
[01:38:13.470 --> 01:38:14.310]  You know what I mean?
[01:38:14.310 --> 01:38:15.510]  What kind of smells are coming out of there?
[01:38:15.510 --> 01:38:17.710]  You know, I wish I had a bigger group of females
[01:38:17.710 --> 01:38:20.550]  to look at in the first pollination.
[01:38:20.550 --> 01:38:21.510]  You know what I mean?
[01:38:21.510 --> 01:38:24.390]  But the females that were there were awesome.
[01:38:24.390 --> 01:38:26.110]  They had good, great resin content.
[01:38:26.110 --> 01:38:28.910]  They dropped resin when they were dry.
[01:38:28.910 --> 01:38:33.190]  Like the tray, the trim bins, you know,
[01:38:33.190 --> 01:38:35.350]  had a good amount of some dropped resin.
[01:38:35.350 --> 01:38:36.750]  They're Afghani, so they're, you know,
[01:38:36.750 --> 01:38:38.190]  they were losing, they lose some resin.
[01:38:38.190 --> 01:38:40.670]  Most of them are, turned those into hash anyway.
[01:38:40.670 --> 01:38:42.830]  So I would assume that there's gonna be
[01:38:42.830 --> 01:38:45.310]  some good washing traits in there.
[01:38:45.310 --> 01:38:46.150]  I don't wash a lot.
[01:38:46.150 --> 01:38:49.750]  I'm mostly flower man myself, but you know,
[01:38:49.750 --> 01:38:50.590]  being what they are, I would assume.
[01:38:50.590 --> 01:38:52.310]  Well good, because so am I.
[01:38:52.310 --> 01:38:54.870]  I can appreciate a man that loves his flower hole.
[01:38:54.870 --> 01:38:58.990]  Yeah, I'm like 99% flower, you know.
[01:38:58.990 --> 01:39:01.110]  I'll smoke some rosin every once in a while,
[01:39:01.110 --> 01:39:04.110]  but I'm 99% flower.
[01:39:04.230 --> 01:39:07.870]  I love the volcano vaporizers,
[01:39:07.870 --> 01:39:09.750]  but I run one through a whip.
[01:39:09.750 --> 01:39:12.270]  I'm always like, because I don't have a longer than a whip.
[01:39:12.270 --> 01:39:14.030]  But I fuck it, and through a bubbler,
[01:39:14.030 --> 01:39:16.550]  I find like, it's just like, you get that vaporized,
[01:39:16.550 --> 01:39:18.510]  but I always find when you direct vape,
[01:39:18.510 --> 01:39:21.030]  it's like a little bit hot on my throat.
[01:39:21.030 --> 01:39:21.870]  It like hurts.
[01:39:21.870 --> 01:39:22.830]  Can be, yeah.
[01:39:22.830 --> 01:39:24.630]  Right, so I was like, I find when you run it
[01:39:24.630 --> 01:39:26.070]  through a bubbler, you get rid of that,
[01:39:26.070 --> 01:39:28.270]  and it's just like, boom, flavors country.
[01:39:28.270 --> 01:39:30.110]  And you can direct paste everything.
[01:39:30.110 --> 01:39:33.510]  I've been able to get a lot more like subtle tones
[01:39:33.950 --> 01:39:37.990]  that are more decipherable, I find in this methodology.
[01:39:37.990 --> 01:39:40.190]  Yeah, you'll really, really taste it that way, man.
[01:39:40.190 --> 01:39:43.510]  That's where you're really gonna pull candies out
[01:39:43.510 --> 01:39:45.550]  and really get funky with it.
[01:39:45.550 --> 01:39:48.990]  You're like, holy cow, that was big league too,
[01:39:48.990 --> 01:39:50.870]  and frigging peppermints, you know what I mean?
[01:39:50.870 --> 01:39:52.950]  Like, it really gets nice.
[01:39:52.950 --> 01:39:55.590]  I have a pack that, yeah, like you said,
[01:39:55.590 --> 01:39:58.990]  you know, it's a dry vape, or it's a flower vape.
[01:39:58.990 --> 01:40:01.110]  I can crush that flower and just put it right in there
[01:40:01.110 --> 01:40:02.750]  and just use it for my mouth.
[01:40:02.790 --> 01:40:04.750]  That's the only one that I've really liked
[01:40:04.750 --> 01:40:06.630]  to use that way, you know, but yeah,
[01:40:06.630 --> 01:40:08.990]  it'll dry out your throat if you hammer it.
[01:40:08.990 --> 01:40:09.830]  Real fast.
[01:40:09.830 --> 01:40:10.670]  If you hammer it.
[01:40:10.670 --> 01:40:12.430]  Like, remember those launch boxes?
[01:40:12.430 --> 01:40:14.510]  Did you have one of those launch boxes ever?
[01:40:14.510 --> 01:40:16.350]  I had one, yeah, I tried one.
[01:40:16.350 --> 01:40:20.150]  You just plug the, ugh, it's like, they hurt.
[01:40:20.150 --> 01:40:22.710]  They rip, they were so painful.
[01:40:22.710 --> 01:40:24.870]  Whenever you would get a hit.
[01:40:24.870 --> 01:40:28.550]  I had the little butterfly thing or whatever.
[01:40:28.550 --> 01:40:31.750]  I tried a bunch of them to try to just, you know.
[01:40:31.750 --> 01:40:33.110]  I had the waterbong one.
[01:40:33.110 --> 01:40:35.390]  The fine one that actually would work, you know?
[01:40:35.390 --> 01:40:36.950]  There was a Cloudius 9,
[01:40:36.950 --> 01:40:39.710]  and it was like a waterbong cylinder,
[01:40:39.710 --> 01:40:41.190]  and it was a vaporizer too.
[01:40:41.190 --> 01:40:42.590]  So that's what got me going on this.
[01:40:42.590 --> 01:40:44.630]  I'm like, okay, well, I can just get a volcano
[01:40:44.630 --> 01:40:45.670]  and attach a whip to it.
[01:40:45.670 --> 01:40:46.510]  It's genius.
[01:40:46.510 --> 01:40:47.950]  Yeah, that's great.
[01:40:47.950 --> 01:40:49.510]  Yeah, like, I have one that,
[01:40:49.510 --> 01:40:51.670]  it's like a volcano rip-off that's similar
[01:40:51.670 --> 01:40:52.870]  that you can run through water,
[01:40:52.870 --> 01:40:54.710]  and we do that with the tube, you know what I mean?
[01:40:54.710 --> 01:40:56.790]  Yeah, yeah, that's a lot of fun.
[01:40:56.790 --> 01:40:59.230]  I love the fear in that there's other people that do that.
[01:40:59.230 --> 01:41:00.470]  I thought I was going to win.
[01:41:00.470 --> 01:41:01.310]  It's fucking epic.
[01:41:01.830 --> 01:41:02.670]  I got a volcano.
[01:41:02.670 --> 01:41:05.230]  I'm definitely trying to run it through some water.
[01:41:05.230 --> 01:41:08.070]  That's a good idea, because I think it's harsh too.
[01:41:08.070 --> 01:41:10.110]  Yeah, it's very dry.
[01:41:11.110 --> 01:41:12.990]  It's like, it's very interesting.
[01:41:12.990 --> 01:41:14.910]  But anyways, I'm looking forward to it.
[01:41:14.910 --> 01:41:18.750]  So next time, I think we'll like, two weeks out,
[01:41:18.750 --> 01:41:20.830]  we'll kind of see where the plants are at
[01:41:20.830 --> 01:41:24.670]  and have another chat and another smoke.
[01:41:24.670 --> 01:41:26.550]  And maybe we'll bring on,
[01:41:26.550 --> 01:41:28.830]  I think we're missing a couple people tonight.
[01:41:28.830 --> 01:41:30.390]  So JJ, we'll hopefully,
[01:41:30.430 --> 01:41:31.670]  we'll try and make it a little bit earlier.
[01:41:31.670 --> 01:41:33.150]  JJ wasn't able to be with us tonight
[01:41:33.150 --> 01:41:35.550]  because he wasn't feeling very well because of his,
[01:41:35.550 --> 01:41:37.990]  wasn't, yeah, he's had a rough week.
[01:41:37.990 --> 01:41:40.110]  So we all send best wishes out to him.
[01:41:40.990 --> 01:41:43.070]  Peter's had a busy day, so he's very,
[01:41:43.070 --> 01:41:44.830]  he's popping around somewhere,
[01:41:44.830 --> 01:41:47.270]  bugging us in the background.
[01:41:47.270 --> 01:41:49.030]  But I appreciate it, guys.
[01:41:49.030 --> 01:41:49.870]  This was a lot of fun.
[01:41:49.870 --> 01:41:50.990]  I'm looking forward to it.
[01:41:50.990 --> 01:41:51.830]  You're good people.
[01:41:51.830 --> 01:41:53.390]  Thanks for taking the time.

[01:41:54.550 --> 01:41:55.750]  I'm fucking pumped.
[01:41:55.750 --> 01:41:58.590]  It's so much better when you get to like,
[01:41:58.630 --> 01:42:01.990]  when you get to like, try somebody's product
[01:42:01.990 --> 01:42:02.990]  that's good people.
[01:42:02.990 --> 01:42:04.310]  Like sometimes you meet people
[01:42:04.310 --> 01:42:06.550]  and it's like, you're kind of all right.
[01:42:06.550 --> 01:42:10.310]  Like, I wasn't like, you were, you were okay.
[01:42:10.310 --> 01:42:14.150]  That was like, I can appreciate how hard you work,
[01:42:14.150 --> 01:42:17.350]  but like, it doesn't help that you were okay.
[01:42:17.350 --> 01:42:18.190]  You know what I mean?
[01:42:18.190 --> 01:42:20.110]  Like, you're fucking good people.
[01:42:20.110 --> 01:42:21.710]  And I gotta be honest,
[01:42:21.710 --> 01:42:24.110]  when I found out that we were gonna do this,
[01:42:24.110 --> 01:42:28.270]  I was happy that it was you because you can just talk.
[01:42:28.950 --> 01:42:29.950]  And I was like, so nervous.
[01:42:29.950 --> 01:42:30.990]  I'm like, I hope I don't have to,
[01:42:30.990 --> 01:42:32.830]  but I knew you had it covered.
[01:42:32.830 --> 01:42:34.310]  So I'm like, all good.
[01:42:35.430 --> 01:42:36.350]  Yeah.
[01:42:36.350 --> 01:42:37.870]  Yeah. Thank you, man.
[01:42:37.870 --> 01:42:38.710]  That's funny.
[01:42:38.710 --> 01:42:40.910]  Yeah. I try not to have too much diarrhea in the mouth,
[01:42:40.910 --> 01:42:41.750]  but-
[01:42:41.750 --> 01:42:43.910]  No, it's all, it's all, it's all great.
[01:42:43.910 --> 01:42:45.790]  Yeah. There's no such thing as a simple answer.
[01:42:45.790 --> 01:42:46.630]  You know what I mean?
[01:42:46.630 --> 01:42:48.550]  There's always, there's always context.
[01:42:48.550 --> 01:42:49.390]  You know what I mean?
[01:42:49.390 --> 01:42:51.990]  So it's funny for me, you know.
[01:42:51.990 --> 01:42:52.830]  It's good.
[01:42:52.830 --> 01:42:54.230]  I appreciate you guys for taking the time though.
[01:42:54.230 --> 01:42:55.950]  This is gonna be really cool.
[01:42:55.950 --> 01:42:58.790]  So I'm excited to see what gets pulled out of there.
[01:42:58.790 --> 01:43:01.630]  You know, looking for one of you guys to be like,
[01:43:01.630 --> 01:43:03.870]  oh man, I'm gonna keep that one around for a little while.
[01:43:03.870 --> 01:43:04.710]  You know what I mean?
[01:43:04.710 --> 01:43:05.550]  And you know-
[01:43:05.550 --> 01:43:07.510]  I'm gonna end up keeping all of them forever.
[01:43:07.510 --> 01:43:10.670]  Remember earlier I said, I can't help.
[01:43:10.670 --> 01:43:12.270]  I can't get it.
[01:43:12.270 --> 01:43:16.270]  There are like, I have a 10 by 10 foot square spot
[01:43:16.270 --> 01:43:20.030]  and I have one, two, three, four, five, six,
[01:43:20.030 --> 01:43:22.950]  seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13 mothers.
[01:43:22.950 --> 01:43:25.150]  And I have a four by eight tent.
[01:43:25.150 --> 01:43:27.310]  How the fuck do I need 13 mothers?
[01:43:27.310 --> 01:43:28.430]  And you know what the worst part is,
[01:43:28.430 --> 01:43:31.590]  is I've got another, like, I got six of you.
[01:43:31.590 --> 01:43:33.390]  I've got, so I named, so you're,
[01:43:33.390 --> 01:43:36.870]  I love that Pam is your wife.
[01:43:36.870 --> 01:43:37.790]  Or-
[01:43:37.790 --> 01:43:41.630]  So no, so my wife, my wife wanted to call,
[01:43:41.630 --> 01:43:43.870]  originally when I had the Pam,
[01:43:43.870 --> 01:43:45.830]  I was trying to think about what I was gonna call it.
[01:43:45.830 --> 01:43:49.030]  Cause I just, you know, I had nothing to call it.
[01:43:49.030 --> 01:43:50.510]  I didn't know what it was or any of that stuff.
[01:43:50.510 --> 01:43:53.190]  So my wife's like, call it Pam Anderson
[01:43:53.230 --> 01:43:56.350]  because she's the most beautiful thing from the nineties.
[01:43:56.350 --> 01:43:58.390]  You know, cause they were old seeds, you know what I mean?
[01:43:58.390 --> 01:44:00.790]  And it was just like from her Baywatch years
[01:44:00.790 --> 01:44:02.110]  and she stood good.
[01:44:02.110 --> 01:44:04.110]  And I was like, hey, I'm down with that.
[01:44:04.110 --> 01:44:05.750]  She was on my wall when I was a kid.
[01:44:05.750 --> 01:44:06.990]  So I was like, let's do it.
[01:44:06.990 --> 01:44:09.350]  Let's put it, let's call it Pam Pam.
[01:44:09.350 --> 01:44:12.470]  So it, over the years, it's just turned into Pam,
[01:44:12.470 --> 01:44:14.790]  you know, Pam one, Pam 15.
[01:44:14.790 --> 01:44:18.150]  But originally it was named for Pam Anderson
[01:44:18.150 --> 01:44:21.750]  cause she was nine, you know, nineties, 2000 seed,
[01:44:22.510 --> 01:44:25.190]  right in the Baywatch era, you know what I mean?
[01:44:25.190 --> 01:44:26.630]  The stuff happened, you know?
[01:44:28.790 --> 01:44:32.390]  And yeah, so there, that's it.
[01:44:32.390 --> 01:44:33.390]  So what's your wife's name?
[01:44:33.390 --> 01:44:34.470]  Is it cooler than Pam?
[01:44:34.470 --> 01:44:35.790]  I hope it's way cooler than Pam.
[01:44:35.790 --> 01:44:37.030]  It's just being.
[01:44:38.070 --> 01:44:39.190]  Yeah, it's cooler than Pam.
[01:44:39.190 --> 01:44:40.590]  Yeah, I think that's cooler than Pam.
[01:44:40.590 --> 01:44:42.390]  It's cooler than Pam, depends who you ask.
[01:44:42.390 --> 01:44:44.590]  Yeah, that's definitely cool.
[01:44:44.590 --> 01:44:47.390]  See, I like, so I did a cross, my first ever cross
[01:44:47.390 --> 01:44:49.590]  and I'm like, I'm gonna like keep working the line down.
[01:44:49.630 --> 01:44:52.150]  I'm like, I got a bunch of time to play with them,
[01:44:52.150 --> 01:44:54.110]  but I've named them after,
[01:44:54.110 --> 01:44:56.510]  they're gonna be continually named after my firstborn,
[01:44:56.510 --> 01:44:57.950]  which is Sara, who was,
[01:44:57.950 --> 01:45:01.430]  and she like really changed a lot in my life.
[01:45:01.430 --> 01:45:04.470]  It was kind of, we'll do that story another time
[01:45:04.470 --> 01:45:05.310]  when we talk about it.
[01:45:05.310 --> 01:45:06.150]  That's cool, that's cool.
[01:45:06.150 --> 01:45:06.990]  We'll get into some introspective.
[01:45:06.990 --> 01:45:08.230]  That's cool.
[01:45:08.230 --> 01:45:09.750]  But again, I appreciate it.
[01:45:09.750 --> 01:45:11.470]  We're just shy of two hours.
[01:45:11.470 --> 01:45:13.150]  Raymond said we have to go to midnight,
[01:45:13.150 --> 01:45:15.390]  but I don't have to listen to Raymond.
[01:45:15.390 --> 01:45:17.310]  So we can do whatever the fuck we want.
[01:45:17.310 --> 01:45:19.430]  I look forward to seeing you guys again.
[01:45:20.190 --> 01:45:23.270]  By the way, all your gear is available where?
[01:45:23.270 --> 01:45:24.110]  Where can we get your gear?
[01:45:24.110 --> 01:45:27.510]  At Daga, Daga loves, got a lot,
[01:45:27.510 --> 01:45:28.790]  a lot of everything that's there.
[01:45:28.790 --> 01:45:30.950]  So any questions, you can always hit me up,
[01:45:31.870 --> 01:45:33.190]  where to find me, you can find me,
[01:45:33.190 --> 01:45:35.990]  Family Tree Seeds and Mr. Trees.
[01:45:37.230 --> 01:45:38.990]  And I think we're all gonna be posting
[01:45:38.990 --> 01:45:41.790]  and doing the photos as well
[01:45:41.790 --> 01:45:44.630]  for on the Daga Academy too.
[01:45:44.630 --> 01:45:45.910]  And then I think next time,
[01:45:45.910 --> 01:45:48.190]  you know what'd be pretty cool is,
[01:45:48.190 --> 01:45:52.270]  do you have like a lot of your mums in clone
[01:45:52.270 --> 01:45:53.590]  in kind of production?
[01:45:53.590 --> 01:45:56.070]  It'd be kind of neat to kind of see some of the plants,
[01:45:56.070 --> 01:45:57.470]  if you have any of them available,
[01:45:57.470 --> 01:45:59.510]  look like Gander at next time, yeah?
[01:45:59.510 --> 01:46:01.350]  Yeah, bring out something funky,
[01:46:01.350 --> 01:46:04.070]  you can kind of get some context on, yeah, for sure.
[01:46:04.070 --> 01:46:04.910]  Yeah, it'd be kind of cool,
[01:46:04.910 --> 01:46:07.870]  like something to look forward to maybe, maybe not.
[01:46:07.870 --> 01:46:10.590]  I think we can all expect and understand at this point
[01:46:10.590 --> 01:46:12.110]  that like plants aren't like perfect
[01:46:12.110 --> 01:46:13.590]  and that things are perfect in the system.
[01:46:13.590 --> 01:46:14.430]  No, yeah, no, it's easy.
[01:46:14.430 --> 01:46:15.870]  But that's why we appreciate that.
[01:46:15.870 --> 01:46:16.990]  You're not healthy, you should,
[01:46:16.990 --> 01:46:19.110]  I shouldn't be up here if I can't grow a plant,
[01:46:19.110 --> 01:46:19.950]  you know what I mean?
[01:46:19.950 --> 01:46:20.790]  So, yeah.
[01:46:20.790 --> 01:46:24.910]  That's for sure.
[01:46:24.910 --> 01:46:27.870]  That's a good stuff, fucking straight up honest.
[01:46:27.870 --> 01:46:30.070]  I can't grow plants, they're all fucking yellow.
[01:46:30.070 --> 01:46:31.670]  Look at them, they're terrible.
[01:46:31.670 --> 01:46:33.830]  It's not, I swear to God, it's the lighting.
[01:46:33.830 --> 01:46:34.790]  I swear to God, it's the lighting.
[01:46:34.790 --> 01:46:37.150]  I bought my house teaching people how to grow fruit
[01:46:37.150 --> 01:46:38.950]  and trees and plants, you know what I mean?
[01:46:38.950 --> 01:46:41.150]  So like shit, man, I can't, you know.
[01:46:41.150 --> 01:46:43.710]  You just said it was gonna pick.
[01:46:43.710 --> 01:46:46.390]  I'm like, man, this is, you know,
[01:46:46.750 --> 01:46:48.390]  this is what I do, it's my language, you know?
[01:46:48.390 --> 01:46:51.190]  So I'll bring a plant to show, for sure.
[01:46:51.190 --> 01:46:54.110]  I'm excited about it, but I appreciate it again.
[01:46:54.110 --> 01:46:56.390]  I'm gonna push this end broadcast button
[01:46:56.390 --> 01:46:57.550]  before I ask another question
[01:46:57.550 --> 01:46:59.310]  and we're stuck here for another like half an hour
[01:46:59.310 --> 01:47:00.910]  as we continue our conversation.
