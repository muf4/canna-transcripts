[00:28.730 --> 01:01.780]  Hey Dr. Anubis, how are you?
[01:01.780 --> 01:03.780]  I'm good, can you hear me?
[01:03.780 --> 01:08.780]  Do me a favor and oh yes I can loud and clear.
[01:08.780 --> 01:10.780]  Okay good.
[01:10.780 --> 01:21.620]  Alright if you guys have got any questions get them rolling.
[01:21.620 --> 01:23.620]  We should be ready to go.
[01:23.620 --> 01:26.620]  I'm just going to turn it up on the far side and we're up on YouTube.
[01:26.620 --> 01:28.620]  Move that over a little bit.
[01:28.620 --> 01:31.620]  Maybe I was being a bit extra.
[01:31.620 --> 01:33.620]  Hey that dude Rich Canniballis.
[01:33.620 --> 01:35.620]  Hello everybody, welcome to another show.
[01:35.620 --> 01:37.620]  There's Cheddar Bob.
[01:37.620 --> 01:41.620]  You can lay there and help today.
[01:41.620 --> 01:44.620]  So we'll make that work out for you.
[01:44.620 --> 01:52.020]  Yeah I think that's going to be our only option.
[01:52.020 --> 01:55.020]  Well we will have a fun show.
[01:55.020 --> 02:00.020]  So anybody in chat that wants to come over, come say hi.
[02:00.020 --> 02:02.020]  The link is in the description.
[02:02.020 --> 02:07.020]  If you want to come ask a question in person, if you want to ask it by just throwing it in the comments here,
[02:07.020 --> 02:09.020]  go ahead and do so.
[02:09.020 --> 02:16.020]  We will try and get to every question that we can as quickly as we can with as much respect to our moderator's time and speaking.
[02:16.020 --> 02:23.020]  But also trying to move through because I know there's lots of questions everybody has and this is a great opportunity to do so.
[02:23.020 --> 02:26.020]  So we've got a small stage right now.
[02:26.020 --> 02:31.020]  But we will obviously have more people join us a little bit later.
[02:31.020 --> 02:33.020]  I'm looking forward to it.
[02:33.020 --> 02:36.020]  So I do see that people are rolling into chat and starting to ask questions.
[02:36.020 --> 02:38.020]  So we do have a member on stage already.
[02:38.020 --> 02:43.020]  So we're going to give them the opportunity to ask the first question.
[02:43.020 --> 02:47.020]  That dude we will get to you in a moment.
[02:47.020 --> 02:54.020]  And as everybody rolls in, just before we get started, I'm going to let everybody introduce themselves.
[02:55.020 --> 02:57.020]  So we'll get to you in a moment.
[02:57.020 --> 03:01.020]  And as everybody rolls in, just before we get started, I'm going to let everybody introduce themselves.
[03:01.020 --> 03:08.020]  That way everybody will have time to roll in and join in case there's other people that are joining.
[03:08.020 --> 03:11.020]  And what's exciting in your new year.
[03:11.020 --> 03:15.020]  And then Cheddar Bob and then Evian and then Matt, which we'll invite up.
[03:15.020 --> 03:19.020]  Come on up and say hi if you're available to come join us for a conversation.
[03:19.020 --> 03:21.020]  If you have some good tips, you can throw them out there.
[03:21.020 --> 03:23.020]  And then we'll get to Gabe right after that.
[03:23.020 --> 03:27.020]  And again, if you want, go ahead and raise your hand now and join the conversation.
[03:27.020 --> 03:30.020]  And we look forward to digging into it.
[03:30.020 --> 03:33.020]  So Dr. Anubis, what are you looking forward to?
[03:33.020 --> 03:35.020]  Hi, everybody.
[03:35.020 --> 03:37.020]  I'm Dr. Anna Schwab.
[03:37.020 --> 03:42.020]  And I am, I guess I'm a scientist, researcher.
[03:42.020 --> 03:47.020]  I have a background in cellular molecular biology and population genetics.
[03:47.020 --> 03:55.020]  And my PhD work was focused on looking at variation in cannabis with kind of a backdrop using genetics.
[03:55.020 --> 03:57.020]  And let's see.
[03:57.020 --> 04:05.020]  And I'm in New Jersey right now working at a company called Shore Organics using aquaponic methods to grow hemp.
[04:05.020 --> 04:07.020]  And let's see.
[04:07.020 --> 04:09.020]  What am I looking forward to in the new year?
[04:09.020 --> 04:11.020]  Oh, hmm.
[04:11.020 --> 04:13.020]  I haven't really thought about it.
[04:13.020 --> 04:15.020]  Hmm.
[04:15.020 --> 04:17.020]  I don't know how to answer that question.
[04:17.020 --> 04:23.190]  So I'm going to pass it on to Cheddar Bob.
[04:23.190 --> 04:25.190]  That's me.
[04:25.190 --> 04:26.190]  I'm Cheddar Bob.
[04:26.190 --> 04:30.190]  I am a 20-year home grower.
[04:30.190 --> 04:35.190]  My background is basically making lots of mistakes and learning from them.
[04:35.190 --> 04:42.190]  And yeah, that's about as deep as I go.
[04:42.190 --> 04:45.190]  So that's something I'm looking forward to in the next year.
[04:45.190 --> 04:50.190]  Oh, it's probably still being here after all this mess clears out that we're going through.
[04:50.190 --> 04:59.390]  So, yeah.
[04:59.390 --> 05:01.390]  Yes, that's me.
[05:01.390 --> 05:02.390]  Hi, guys.
[05:02.390 --> 05:03.390]  It's Evian.
[05:03.390 --> 05:06.390]  I, hmm.
[05:06.390 --> 05:07.390]  That's a fun question.
[05:07.390 --> 05:11.390]  I am a longtime plant person.
[05:12.390 --> 05:18.390]  I've been touching plants and teaching permaculture and other things for almost 18 years now.
[05:18.390 --> 05:25.390]  And I have extensive experience in the regulated cannabis market in Oregon.
[05:25.390 --> 05:27.390]  I've been doing that for the past six years.
[05:27.390 --> 05:38.390]  And I also have a lot of experience with large-scale nursery production and breeding in both the hemp space and the regulated space.
[05:38.390 --> 05:42.390]  And I am a teacher at Oakster Dam University.
[05:42.390 --> 05:45.390]  And I've taught at Hemp University and other places as well.
[05:45.390 --> 05:47.390]  And I kind of consult in the field.
[05:47.390 --> 05:51.390]  And I just love all things cannabis and plants in general.
[05:51.390 --> 05:56.390]  So happy to share information and happy to be here with these other kind people.
[05:56.390 --> 06:00.390]  And looking forward to 2022.
[06:00.390 --> 06:05.390]  You know, just there's a lot of cutting-edge science coming out around cannabis.
[06:06.390 --> 06:09.390]  And I feel like it's one of those things you could learn something new every day.
[06:09.390 --> 06:11.390]  So I'm kind of like a lifelong learner.
[06:11.390 --> 06:15.390]  And I feel like there's already been a lot of fun stuff happening this year within the space.
[06:15.390 --> 06:22.390]  So I'm kind of excited for maybe some shifts in the marketplace also.
[06:22.390 --> 06:24.390]  So that's Evian incomplete.
[06:24.390 --> 06:27.390]  And I'll pass it to Matt.
[06:27.390 --> 06:32.390]  Hello, Matt, also known as gnarlyroots on Instagram.
[06:33.390 --> 06:39.390]  I'm a huge plant advocate and kind of citizen scientist.
[06:39.390 --> 06:47.390]  I have education in greenhouse management and soil and crop science.
[06:47.390 --> 06:56.390]  But I much, much, much like Evian just love plants and the science and what they can all do across the board.
[06:56.390 --> 06:59.390]  Especially cannabis.
[06:59.390 --> 07:02.390]  Like Shafa said, this year has already been exciting for science.
[07:02.390 --> 07:09.390]  And I think it's going to be an even more kind of exciting year as it goes on.
[07:09.390 --> 07:12.390]  So yeah, pass it over to Gabe.
[07:12.390 --> 07:17.390]  Gabe, you want to go ahead and ask the first question of the day, brother?
[07:17.390 --> 07:20.390]  Or sister, I'm not too sure.
[07:20.390 --> 07:23.390]  Yes, I would love to ask a question.
[07:23.390 --> 07:26.390]  So, I'm going to ask a question.
[07:26.390 --> 07:40.390]  So, general question is, how do I eliminate aphids?
[07:40.390 --> 07:46.390]  So, what I've attempted so far is Bolivarian Bassiana.
[07:46.390 --> 07:50.390]  And I'm told that either that would work or no.
[07:51.390 --> 07:56.390]  The second treatment that we're using is Velophore Bassiana.
[07:56.390 --> 08:06.390]  So, my question is, so the directions call for it to be mixed and mixed for 30 minutes prior to use.
[08:06.390 --> 08:10.390]  But I'm wondering if I can store it mixed.
[08:10.390 --> 08:15.390]  It's been mixed for about a week and it smells different than when I mixed it.
[08:15.390 --> 08:21.390]  So, I was wondering if, first of all, anyone has any super crafty ideas besides,
[08:21.390 --> 08:24.390]  I'm getting ready to kill my entire crop, I believe.
[08:24.390 --> 08:30.390]  Now, I'm told if I put something in flour, the roots will taste different to rice root aphids and they will leave.
[08:30.390 --> 08:32.390]  So, they'll go to my veg plants.
[08:32.390 --> 08:42.390]  I'm just dealing with this, but I guess the real question is, can I store Velophore Bassiana already mixed?
[08:43.390 --> 08:45.390]  That's all I got.
[08:45.390 --> 08:47.390]  Hey, Gabe.
[08:47.390 --> 08:55.390]  I'm pretty familiar with Bolivarian Bassiana and those kind of the brand name products that it's sold under.
[08:55.390 --> 09:06.390]  And those, I believe, you're going to be losing efficacy really steep, like it's going to be a steep drop off.
[09:06.390 --> 09:08.390]  You know, they're alive at that.
[09:08.390 --> 09:15.390]  Actually, I'm not sure if they're alive or if it's just the sport, but you don't want to leave that mixed for extended amounts of time.
[09:15.390 --> 09:24.390]  I'm not sure exactly what it was recommended, but whatever it says on the label, you're not really going to want to store it much longer than that.
[09:24.390 --> 09:30.390]  And it's going to, you know, be dramatically uneffective, but it will work great.
[09:30.390 --> 09:42.390]  Another thing that you might be interested in looking into is some sort of nematodes that will help take care of some of the root aphids.
[09:42.390 --> 09:47.390]  But I'm currently dealing with some myself and I just use some Bovary Bassiana.
[09:47.390 --> 09:52.390]  But yeah, I would not recommend mixing large amounts of that and storing it.
[09:53.390 --> 10:05.390]  I want to concur with everything that Johnny's saying just really quickly and also say, you know, it really I'm a big fan of Bovary Bassiana also.
[10:05.390 --> 10:10.390]  And I feel like it needs to be part of generally a three pronged approach.
[10:10.390 --> 10:15.390]  Anytime you have a more serious issue with something like that.
[10:16.390 --> 10:25.390]  And I just was sending a friend recently some, you know, it depends because you're already so far in flower, but there are certain things I'm not sure what market you're in.
[10:25.390 --> 10:30.390]  You're allowed to use certain things in different states and not in others.
[10:30.390 --> 10:34.390]  And I feel like usually what's recommended is some sort of like drench or sprench.
[10:35.390 --> 10:45.390]  And I've found very good luck with Asagard in addition to like I'm a big fan of not all the Bovary Bassiana is created equal, I will say.
[10:45.390 --> 10:52.390]  So what Johnny is pointing to with efficacy, I will say that there are definitely superior products on the market.
[10:52.390 --> 11:05.390]  And, you know, I know what I feel comfortable using, but I definitely see different efficacy with different, I guess it would be strains of the Bovary Bassiana.
[11:05.390 --> 11:09.390]  So I just want to put that out there as well. And also, yeah, you can't store it.
[11:09.390 --> 11:13.390]  Even I mean, it needs to be used like day of and mixed very well.
[11:13.390 --> 11:20.390]  And also, I definitely want to just put it out there because this is other people are listening is that you need to wear a mask when you're mixing that as well.
[11:21.390 --> 11:24.390]  It's not good to inhale. So just a few things about that.
[11:26.390 --> 11:31.390]  If I can jump in here too as well. So, I just wanted to ask a question.
[11:31.390 --> 11:37.390]  I think I don't know for sure, but you said that you were going to flip your plants in the flower and you heard that they would leave.
[11:37.390 --> 11:41.390]  So your main problem is essentially you have an aphid population.
[11:41.390 --> 11:45.390]  And do you have a photo of the like the type of aphid that they are?
[11:45.390 --> 11:49.390]  Do you have cover crop and they're on your cover crop? Are they on your physical plants?
[11:49.390 --> 11:55.390]  Are they starting to really chow in there? Like what level of situation are we talking here?
[11:55.390 --> 12:00.390]  It sounds like they're pretty dire, but like, just can you clarify a little?
[12:00.390 --> 12:08.390]  Like, are your plants going to, are they dying or are you mitigating the problem pretty well and they're still in the vegetative state?
[12:09.390 --> 12:16.390]  Okay. So I have reference from a woman on Instagram named Suzanne Bug Lady.
[12:16.390 --> 12:19.390]  I'm sure a bunch of you guys are probably familiar with her.
[12:19.390 --> 12:23.390]  She identified the bug as the rice root aphid.
[12:23.390 --> 12:26.390]  And she's the one that's been guiding me through this process.
[12:26.390 --> 12:29.390]  So that's another thing that's confusing to me, right?
[12:29.390 --> 12:32.390]  Because I noticed it on the transplant.
[12:32.390 --> 12:39.390]  She told me to put the yellow strips at the bottom of my plastic pots where the holes are for early sign of detection.
[12:39.390 --> 12:41.390]  And she did say to use a three-step process.
[12:41.390 --> 12:48.390]  So the other process that I'm using is safer soap or I use suffix oil for killing the adults.
[12:48.390 --> 12:50.390]  And that is done every three days.
[12:50.390 --> 12:54.390]  And then every four days I'm doing a 90 second soil dunk.
[12:54.390 --> 12:55.390]  I've done this twice.
[12:56.390 --> 13:02.390]  So now I'm doing a lot of this work to keep these things at bay, I guess.
[13:02.390 --> 13:04.390]  I still see them moving when I check.
[13:04.390 --> 13:10.390]  But what's confusing to me is all of my plants and flower are extremely healthy.
[13:10.390 --> 13:13.390]  So it's like, I'm not sure which way to go.
[13:13.390 --> 13:16.390]  I'm going to flower everything and reset.
[13:16.390 --> 13:18.390]  I've taken clones of my mother's.
[13:18.390 --> 13:19.390]  Everything will be reset.
[13:20.390 --> 13:27.390]  But my plants are extremely healthy and it doesn't seem like any of the Basiana that I'm using is killing them.
[13:30.390 --> 13:37.390]  So Gabe, that stuff has like a seven day window before it really starts to do its thing.
[13:37.390 --> 13:45.390]  So I don't know if you started applying kind of recently, but yeah, you want to at least give it like a week to see it in action.
[13:45.390 --> 13:54.390]  If your plants are healthy and you're treating it like this, you're not in a horrible place because I'm sure that stuff will start to do its thing.
[13:54.390 --> 13:57.390]  And it works really well once it starts working.
[13:59.390 --> 14:05.390]  It sounds like you're taking the right steps to getting a hold on this.
[14:06.390 --> 14:07.390]  Totally.
[14:07.390 --> 14:19.390]  I would agree with Johnny and just say that pretty much in my world, what Suzanne the Bug Lady says is pretty much like, we listen to what she says pretty strictly.
[14:19.390 --> 14:28.390]  I will say I'm a huge fan of the products that she recommends and that you're using.
[14:28.390 --> 14:34.390]  I find that Cephoil X is one of the most beneficial products that I found in a really long time.
[14:34.390 --> 14:40.390]  I just want to point out since you already mentioned it, it works really incredibly well for spider mites.
[14:40.390 --> 14:45.390]  I've actually never found some people do take issue with mineral oil because of like plant cuticle stuff.
[14:45.390 --> 14:52.390]  But I honestly, I feel like plants like it and I think it works really effectively and it's just a more natural product.
[14:52.390 --> 15:03.390]  I will say that, you know, I have worked with Kip from BioWorks, Biosafe Solutions, and I just I love their recommendations.
[15:03.390 --> 15:11.390]  And so I'm assuming that you're using BioCeres WP when you say that you're doing that, because that's I think one of the better.
[15:11.390 --> 15:14.390]  And like Johnny said, it does take a second to work.
[15:14.390 --> 15:23.390]  But, you know, I will say for root aphids, what Kip recommended to me was the Drench and Sprench with Asagard.
[15:24.390 --> 15:31.390]  And, you know, I've had it all depends on kind of like what sort of knockdown you're looking for.
[15:31.390 --> 15:38.390]  But I feel like if your plants are healthy and you're pretty close to flower, I wouldn't really worry about that.
[15:38.390 --> 15:47.390]  I will say that when you reset your room, making sure that you're really doing a thorough job cleaning because they're super sneaky buggers.
[15:47.390 --> 15:55.390]  So I would just be extra cautious on your next turn and really follow extra protocols to make sure that you are not continuing the problem.
[15:57.390 --> 16:00.390]  And now a root aphid a little bit more. Oh, sorry, Ted or Bob. Go ahead.
[16:02.390 --> 16:06.390]  I was just going to say there's also the approach of predatory insects.
[16:06.390 --> 16:13.390]  I'm not sure which ones necessarily affect or will go after root aphids.
[16:14.390 --> 16:24.390]  But I would imagine some Swirsky or H. miles, rove beetles and such would be a good thing to introduce for the soil dwelling larvae and such.
[16:26.390 --> 16:33.390]  And there's even some, I know this is going to sound crazy, but there are some, what's the term I'm looking for?
[16:34.390 --> 16:47.390]  Some other, I guess, aggressive aphids that you can bring in that will knock those down too.
[16:47.390 --> 16:53.390]  I think it's Aphidus ervi and then Cucamaris as well.
[16:54.390 --> 17:13.390]  But one thing too, cold press on top of everything, cold press neem, when done back to back can really start to at least knock them down to get more control.
[17:15.390 --> 17:16.390]  Which is another one.
[17:16.390 --> 17:20.390]  I want to say, I think that both Cheddar Bob and Matt are correct.
[17:20.390 --> 17:26.390]  And I just will say that if Suzanne the bug lady didn't recommend beneficials right out the gate for a problem,
[17:26.390 --> 17:35.390]  one of the reasons you don't always want to start with beneficials is because if you have a serious enough population or infestation,
[17:35.390 --> 17:41.390]  and I'm more just saying this for the audience in general, because if you have a more serious problem,
[17:42.390 --> 17:48.390]  sometimes it requires some sort of knockdown before you can actually introduce beneficials.
[17:48.390 --> 17:53.390]  I'm a huge fan of that route and just using bio controls in general.
[17:53.390 --> 18:01.390]  But I will say that if you're having an actual pretty serious infestation, it just can become kind of like a waste of money,
[18:01.390 --> 18:06.390]  especially if you're in some sort of skilled production and you also don't want to kill the beneficials.
[18:07.390 --> 18:11.390]  And I know that in some markets you can't use just straight neem.
[18:11.390 --> 18:17.390]  So that's why the Asagard or there are certain products that are allowed generally within the regulated market.
[18:17.390 --> 18:20.390]  And California has some of the most stringent rules.
[18:20.390 --> 18:27.390]  So that's where when you can't use neem, you can use a neem based product like Asagard or something along those lines.
[18:28.390 --> 18:45.390]  Totally. And that's like such a fantastic point to even kind of bring up with IPM to note that the processes in which you kind of like initiate these things are very important.
[18:45.390 --> 18:55.390]  Because you can, like you kind of noted, put something in and then turn around and think that you're doing great by spraying neem or spraying Asagard
[18:55.390 --> 18:57.390]  and just delete everything that you just like put in.
[18:57.390 --> 19:07.390]  So it's best to find a very systematic way to go about your controls.
[19:08.390 --> 19:12.390]  I learned that the hard way, I will say too.
[19:12.390 --> 19:15.390]  I just want to say I'm a huge fan of beneficial insects.
[19:15.390 --> 19:19.390]  And I think I learned the hard way that if the problem is too extreme,
[19:19.390 --> 19:23.390]  then I think that Suzanne has helped back that up over time for me in my head where it's like,
[19:23.390 --> 19:31.390]  it's just like getting a hold of the situation before you just jump in and respond with bio controls.
[19:32.390 --> 19:36.390]  You're also in an interesting situation, Gabe, because it's a root aphid.
[19:36.390 --> 19:38.390]  And I'm not like, I mean, rover beetles.
[19:38.390 --> 19:46.390]  Yeah, there's not like hypo is not really going to be able to take on like such a large,
[19:47.390 --> 19:49.390]  like it's just probably not going to work.
[19:49.390 --> 19:54.390]  I'm not really clear on a lot of large predatory root defending.
[19:55.390 --> 20:01.390]  Is anybody else aware of any like I heard the rover, I heard the hypo, but these kind of like rover I can see,
[20:01.390 --> 20:03.390]  but I don't know about hypo.
[20:03.390 --> 20:07.390]  I'm wondering if there's anything else that anybody's seen available on the market or in general.
[20:07.390 --> 20:15.390]  There was also a secondary question that is very related to this is where would you guys suggest purchasing beneficial microbes?
[20:15.390 --> 20:20.390]  Because this is actually not beneficial microbes, but beneficial predatory insects.
[20:20.390 --> 20:24.390]  And I think this is really important because if you don't get them fresh, they're fucked.
[20:24.390 --> 20:28.390]  So like buying them off eBay is sometimes not the best idea.
[20:28.390 --> 20:31.390]  So if you guys want to jump in, it looks like Cheddar Bob is opening up.
[20:31.390 --> 20:32.390]  You want to start?
[20:33.390 --> 20:42.390]  Yeah, I fortunately I started my bet off with beneficials and I always add them about every three or four months.
[20:43.390 --> 20:50.390]  But I use beneficial insectary who you can order through green method.com.
[20:51.390 --> 20:52.390]  That's who I use.
[20:52.390 --> 20:56.390]  And I forgot the other thing that I was going to say.
[20:56.390 --> 20:58.390]  So there we are.
[21:02.390 --> 21:07.390]  Did you have a have a predatory insect for root aphids?
[21:07.390 --> 21:08.390]  Is that maybe?
[21:08.390 --> 21:09.390]  Yeah, thank you.
[21:09.390 --> 21:19.390]  I was thinking like I'm not sure about how well is it millipedes or centipedes, whichever ones or maybe pill bugs might might help a little bit in there.
[21:19.390 --> 21:24.390]  But those are the two I was thinking of for some some penetration down deep.
[21:26.390 --> 21:29.390]  You know, like this whole conversation and I just figured out who it was.
[21:29.390 --> 21:38.390]  I was like, man, somebody's been posting about root aphid or about rice root aphids and it's sink sink angel.
[21:39.390 --> 21:44.390]  He's got a couple of posts on it right now, which is pretty, pretty timely, I guess.
[21:45.390 --> 21:56.390]  I was going to say the same thing is that I'm pretty sure Matthew Gates is going to do like a root aphid, some sort of IPM primer.
[21:56.390 --> 22:02.390]  And maybe if he's working on a future cannibals project also, Linda, I just wanted to point that out because I think it's coming up.
[22:02.390 --> 22:09.390]  And I have a friend whose facility is having major issues as part of like, it's like fresh in my mind because I've just been sending them all of my data.
[22:09.390 --> 22:13.390]  Because I think it's actually one of those things that I haven't had to deal with as frequently.
[22:13.390 --> 22:16.390]  But when they do come, I mean, I just think they're gross.
[22:16.390 --> 22:20.390]  I'm not big. Aphids are like the nemesis at this point.
[22:20.390 --> 22:31.390]  So I will say and I will say, I'm just curious what your concept is there with the pill bugs, because I've actually had them turn, especially in like living soil.
[22:31.390 --> 22:41.390]  In the past, I've had issues where they actually started to eat the cannabis plants, like got like out of control and just started to really like hit the cannabis plants hard.
[22:41.390 --> 22:43.390]  So I always view them as a beneficial.
[22:43.390 --> 22:51.390]  I view them as beneficial in the compost, but I've had them get out of control a few different times and actually start eating like the stems of the plants.
[22:51.390 --> 23:01.390]  Yeah, I've also seen that. And it seems to the instances I've seen, they seem to be in like newly transplanted or younger plants.
[23:02.390 --> 23:12.390]  I know Blue of Green Tank has had a few times where he's had issues and he's actually just wrapped the stock with aluminum foil and kind of tulip it out.
[23:12.390 --> 23:17.390]  And that stops them from going up the stock and chewing on it.
[23:17.390 --> 23:23.390]  So, but yeah, they can get out of hand. It's something to definitely keep your eye on.
[23:24.390 --> 23:38.390]  Yeah, I've had them kind of get out of hand and in my living soil bed where they were definitely at night, they would come up when the lights were off and really like just be hitting the base of my plants really, really hard.
[23:38.390 --> 23:45.390]  And then once the lights came on, they'd kind of go back to wherever their little holes were so they can get out of hand quick.
[23:46.390 --> 23:51.390]  But yeah, it's crazy how serendipitous things have been with the root aphids.
[23:51.390 --> 23:59.390]  Like I've seen all those posts in question and then I'm like just kind of looking at all my plants, checking out the roots.
[23:59.390 --> 24:04.390]  And one plant's not doing so hot compared to the rest of the others.
[24:04.390 --> 24:09.390]  And sure enough, like I was thinking about root aphids. I'd seen it a bunch.
[24:09.390 --> 24:16.390]  I pop the pot off and I'm looking at it. And of course, yeah, there's freaking root aphids all on this plant.
[24:16.390 --> 24:24.390]  It was actually from a teen that I bought at the Emerald Cup. I bought like four or five clones in a teen.
[24:24.390 --> 24:28.390]  And of course, the one that actually had soil mass gets through.
[24:28.390 --> 24:33.390]  I usually I have an IPM protocol before I bring things into my house.
[24:33.390 --> 24:37.390]  It involves soap dunks and sulfur.
[24:38.390 --> 24:42.390]  And of course, you know, soap dunks and sulfur aren't going to kill root aphids.
[24:42.390 --> 24:48.390]  So, yeah, they like snuck past my regimen and I brought them in the house.
[24:48.390 --> 24:53.390]  But yeah, they're just they're super prevalent. And honestly, I've had them in my 4x8 bed.
[24:53.390 --> 24:57.390]  And I was really worried that they would be like a persistent chronic problem.
[24:57.390 --> 25:05.390]  And after a few treatments with it was either Bio Series or Botanigard.
[25:05.390 --> 25:10.390]  One of the two Boveria Bossiana products in it, they were gone.
[25:10.390 --> 25:15.390]  You know, they never resurfaced in my 4x8 bed. So there's definitely hope on getting rid of them.
[25:15.390 --> 25:21.390]  They're not like something I'm super, super concerned with.
[25:21.390 --> 25:24.390]  But yeah, interesting stuff.
[25:24.390 --> 25:30.390]  I think that's a really good point. I mean, I think also that what you said before, Johnny, that they can take a little bit of time.
[25:30.390 --> 25:36.390]  So being patient with those products sometimes is because they don't work immediately.
[25:36.390 --> 25:43.390]  But I will say, too, just on the where to look for good bio controls is I've also had good luck with BioBest.
[25:43.390 --> 25:47.390]  And I've worked with a bunch of different companies over the years.
[25:47.390 --> 25:52.390]  I think for me, it's like the ease of shipping is a big deal for me.
[25:52.390 --> 25:58.390]  And then also, like the population, I think when you start to learn who you can trust and who you can't trust.
[25:58.390 --> 26:09.390]  And I feel like making sure that you're very clear with your tracking, because if you definitely the sort of thing you do not want to forget about in your mailbox, especially when it's hot outside.
[26:09.390 --> 26:14.390]  So just keep that in mind, because that has also happened.
[26:14.390 --> 26:18.390]  Like nobody checked the mail to get the thing. And it's like it's just a bad.
[26:18.390 --> 26:24.390]  You know, it's a very they're very expensive and you want to just treat them like gold a little bit.
[26:28.770 --> 26:31.770]  Go for it, Matt. You wanted to jump in there. Go ahead.
[26:31.770 --> 26:44.770]  Oh, I just like pill bugs are just so, so fun. Like every time this conversation comes up, I always like to bring up the fact that their land crustaceans just like a mindfuck.
[26:44.770 --> 26:53.770]  You know, like, I don't know. It's just really cool. They're like in the same family that crabs and everything.
[26:54.770 --> 27:00.770]  We have so I'm like next to the ocean being in Vancouver, BC. I mean, it'll probably be relatively the same thing.
[27:00.770 --> 27:05.770]  There's probably a few people on the panel here. They're relatively the same space. And we have masses of them.
[27:05.770 --> 27:15.770]  I can actually set up a small plastic container and put it up against the wall during spring and fall and collect them by the by the dozens.
[27:15.770 --> 27:22.770]  Like, I mean, huge volumes of them. And but they're not. I find there's a food mitigation issue.
[27:22.770 --> 27:28.770]  Like they'll attack your plants if there isn't stuff to go to. And there's a few plants that they really goddamn like is turnips.
[27:29.770 --> 27:36.770]  They really like eating my turnips. So if you throw some turnips down, it might be a little bit helpful with that type of thing.
[27:36.770 --> 27:40.770]  But I think there's also needs to be this food sources that imbalance there.
[27:40.770 --> 27:48.770]  I think we touched on a great couple of points with like a not jumping right to beneficial pests and making sure that you follow kind of not beneficial pests.
[27:48.770 --> 27:56.770]  That's a terrible term. Beneficial insects, you know, predator pests, predator bugs and and using those.
[27:56.770 --> 28:01.770]  But after a certain amount of time and making sure that you're not just going to throw throw them into a neem infested area.
[28:01.770 --> 28:05.770]  I myself have used BioBest. I think they have a great lineup of products.
[28:06.770 --> 28:13.770]  And there's a lot of interesting stuff out there. We actually have an amazing panelist that we're going to bring on next week at the Dank Hour 2.
[28:13.770 --> 28:20.770]  That is a Canadian Quebec company. And they have some like they do a lot of work with the universities here in Canada.
[28:20.770 --> 28:27.770]  I'm not going to speak for him, but they do a lot of work with the universities and a lot of other crops in Canada.
[28:27.770 --> 28:32.770]  And it has found a couple of new and interesting kind of pests that they've been rearing.
[28:32.770 --> 28:38.770]  So that'll be kind of neat to check out. There's this one that's apparently just a voracious eater of aphids.
[28:38.770 --> 28:45.770]  And it's a little and it's a spider mite. And it's a large, but it's a large little large, large little red spider.
[28:45.770 --> 28:48.770]  So it's pretty cool. Jason, welcome to this stage as well.
[28:48.770 --> 28:57.770]  Did you have an alternative method that is not commonly thought of for dealing with root aphids, rice root aphids to be exactly specific?
[28:57.770 --> 28:59.770]  Since I've already said your name.
[29:00.770 --> 29:04.770]  I do not.
[29:09.000 --> 29:10.000]  I just want to add one quick thing.
[29:10.000 --> 29:12.000]  Can I just jump in real quick and say.
[29:14.000 --> 29:15.000]  Go ahead, Dave.
[29:15.000 --> 29:19.000]  Oh, sorry. So I just so I wanted to say thank you guys so much for all your information.
[29:19.000 --> 29:32.000]  And then the two things that I I wanted that I think it was really important about what everybody said was, first of all, I've noticed it is a three prong attack.
[29:32.000 --> 29:35.000]  You can't just do one thing and expect it to go away.
[29:35.000 --> 29:44.000]  It's a diligent process and very meticulous in you just have to be very meticulous and and not give up relentless on killing them.
[29:44.000 --> 29:48.000]  First thing. The second thing is we had mentioned to people.
[29:48.000 --> 29:55.000]  Suzanne Bug Lady helps me 100 percent for free on all angles and all levels.
[29:55.000 --> 30:00.000]  And Zenthal wanted to charge me two hundred fifty dollars for console.
[30:00.000 --> 30:02.000]  So he's very good.
[30:02.000 --> 30:07.000]  I'm sure all things good. But for the audience, Suzanne is willing to help 100 percent for free.
[30:07.000 --> 30:09.000]  No, I did take her after, but she's a very helpful.
[30:09.000 --> 30:11.000]  Gives a lot of information for free. Thank you.
[30:11.000 --> 30:12.000]  That's all I got.
[30:12.000 --> 30:18.000]  And Suzanne, the bug lady. Yeah, she's like she's pretty much like the authority in the space and has been for a long time.
[30:18.000 --> 30:20.000]  So I really I really appreciate her.
[30:20.000 --> 30:23.000]  I've learned so much from her and just on the topic of her.
[30:23.000 --> 30:44.000]  I believe that I just wanted to point everybody on the panel to one of my absolute favorite conferences that I've missed the past couple of years because of the pandemic is the is the bio controls and bio stimulants conference that is going to be back on this year,
[30:44.000 --> 30:47.000]  which I'm really excited about. So it's March 1st and 2nd.
[30:48.000 --> 30:53.000]  And if you're interested in learning, it's learning about bio controls and bio stimulants.
[30:53.000 --> 31:00.000]  It literally is such an incredible agricultural event and just so much information.
[31:00.000 --> 31:09.000]  It's usually very cutting edge and they do a full day tracked for cannabis, which is so it's like you're alongside also a lot of other agricultural crops.
[31:09.000 --> 31:14.000]  Like there's like the point I've learned a ton from like the point study of people over the years.
[31:14.000 --> 31:18.000]  And Suzanne, the bug lady will often be a speaker there as well.
[31:18.000 --> 31:27.000]  And I've I think the last time I believe I missed the last one and she did a whole day on aphids, which was is really incredible.
[31:27.000 --> 31:37.000]  So the the wisdom that comes through on that and to dive deeper and all of the best bio controls beneficial insect people are there.
[31:37.000 --> 31:41.000]  And also, it's really fascinating to learn about bio stimulants and crop steering.
[31:41.000 --> 31:45.000]  So it's just it's just a really awesome educational event.
[31:45.000 --> 31:48.000]  And I highly encourage people to attend if you want to learn more.
[31:49.000 --> 32:01.610]  Can I hit one more thing on the roly poly or the pill bugs if we have time?
[32:01.610 --> 32:04.610]  Or do we still want to focus on the root?
[32:04.610 --> 32:07.610]  Yeah, go ahead. I'm just pulling up that conference thing.
[32:07.610 --> 32:13.610]  You just go ahead and touch on that and then we'll start trying to dig into some more questions from the Future Cannabis Project side.
[32:13.610 --> 32:16.610]  I do see a few of them out there. Don't be afraid to pop them in.
[32:16.610 --> 32:20.610]  And don't be afraid if you're in the audience to raise your hand and come up on stage and ask your question.
[32:20.610 --> 32:23.610]  No big or small. And we will dig right into it.
[32:23.610 --> 32:29.610]  Like as as as deep as the root aphid goes, we will answer that question for you.
[32:29.610 --> 32:32.610]  So if you looks like Jason has his mic open there, too.
[32:32.610 --> 32:35.610]  So if you guys want to just go ahead and I'll get that posted.
[32:35.610 --> 32:43.610]  Yeah, I just I did want to mention that Suzanne is actually going to be speaking here in Massachusetts out near the Sturbridge area.
[32:43.610 --> 32:55.610]  So kind of western Massachusetts, February, I guess, February 12th and 13th at the Organic Cultivators Supernatural Conference.
[32:55.610 --> 32:57.610]  It's February 11th through 13th.
[32:57.610 --> 33:07.610]  And we're actually going to be talking with Eric Brewer, who's one of the main sponsors of that conference tomorrow night on my show.
[33:07.610 --> 33:10.610]  But, yeah, Suzanne's going to be out here in February.
[33:10.610 --> 33:15.610]  I know she's at the Humboldt Regenerative Conference.
[33:15.610 --> 33:20.610]  She's also going to be, I believe, at the Michigan and Maine ones as well.
[33:20.610 --> 33:24.610]  So there's definitely some great opportunities to to chat with Suzanne.
[33:24.610 --> 33:29.610]  Make sure you bring your tinfoil hat if you're going to talk with Suzanne as well.
[33:29.610 --> 33:39.610]  She's a big fan of letting people know that bro science is not OK and that real science is the only way.
[33:39.610 --> 33:51.610]  And she's very, very quick to point out and and go after things that are really not accurate or not truthful.
[33:51.610 --> 34:02.610]  And so she definitely she'll even break out the tinfoil hat herself and has worn it at least more at least once, if not multiple times at the regen conferences.
[34:03.610 --> 34:09.610]  So, yeah, no, she's fantastic. And Matthew Gates is also just a tremendous resource.
[34:09.610 --> 34:20.610]  They both have different approaches and backgrounds and they actually don't necessarily see eye to eye on a lot of things, actually.
[34:20.610 --> 34:26.610]  So they've had some interesting run ins between the two of them, but they're both just fantastic resources.
[34:26.610 --> 34:33.970]  And I love chatting with both of them. They're really wonderful sources of knowledge.
[34:33.970 --> 34:36.970]  Awesome. Let's jump into the next question. So we get answering some of them.
[34:36.970 --> 34:39.970]  Gabe, I hope I gave you every last little bit that you want.
[34:39.970 --> 34:43.970]  And if you guys want to see some creepy bug aphid pictures, Evian, don't look at my profile.
[34:43.970 --> 34:51.970]  I popped a couple of reels up because, like I said, I am it's that time of year where things are going from the cold to the warm.
[34:51.970 --> 34:55.970]  And of course, my my greenhouse is starting to take in some bugs.
[34:55.970 --> 35:00.970]  But I have I have a small population of aphids. Actually, I have two types of aphids in my in my tent right now.
[35:01.970 --> 35:04.970]  Neither of which is touching my cannabis, mind you.
[35:04.970 --> 35:09.970]  So I will I will let you know that they are in all sorts of other plants in my cover crop.
[35:09.970 --> 35:11.970]  There's also a few lacewings in there and stuff like that.
[35:11.970 --> 35:15.970]  The population is getting a little bit higher than my my comfortability states.
[35:15.970 --> 35:22.970]  But I think there's a one last point that before we move on to this next question that I really think is very important to touch on.
[35:22.970 --> 35:28.970]  Because you spoke very strongly, Gabe, about like if you see these be on it, destroy them.
[35:28.970 --> 35:34.970]  Go hard. I mean, in this situation, get that area clear, fix it, and then then look at moving forward and prevention.
[35:34.970 --> 35:38.970]  But sometimes overreaction is exactly that.
[35:38.970 --> 35:43.970]  And just like when we get a virus, we get sick and our body overreacts and makes ourselves sick.
[35:43.970 --> 35:47.970]  We can actually cause further damages and problems in the long run.
[35:47.970 --> 35:56.970]  So, say, for example, you know, there are other beneficial bugs that are about to approach these and have hatched at the same time a little bit later to make sure that you're little.
[35:56.970 --> 36:03.970]  They actually usually hatch a little bit later to make sure that there are pests in your plants so that they have food right off the bat.
[36:03.970 --> 36:10.970]  So like if we pull the trigger too quickly, sometimes we can really end up causing a lot more damage to the situation in general.
[36:10.970 --> 36:17.970]  So I wanted to jump into the next question and not to add more complexity to the situation.
[36:17.970 --> 36:20.970]  Hey, really quick. Would you mind before you jump to that next question?
[36:20.970 --> 36:23.970]  I just want to say something that I forgot.
[36:23.970 --> 36:43.970]  It's just as far as the conversation in general, because what I did see your post and I meant to I just have been working all day, but I meant to respond to you that I've been a huge fan for years on all crops of like washing your plants is like that is literally your first line of defense.
[36:43.970 --> 36:56.970]  And something that actually I felt so good about when I the first time I saw Suzanne the bug lady speak live. That was what she said. And I was like, yes, I've been I've been saying this for so long.
[36:56.970 --> 37:07.970]  And so I just want to say there's lots of different things that you can use. There's lots of safe insecticidal soaps and just soaps in general, but I feel like that is generally like I had roses.
[37:08.970 --> 37:17.970]  My roses and my hops in my home garden both had a since last year and that was the first line of defense. So when I saw your post, that was my immediate thought was like, wash the plants.
[37:17.970 --> 37:31.970]  So, just just want to put that out there because I think it's a valuable in and also to tie back to what Gabe said that's generally part of my three pronged approach, depending on how large a crop and like what you're dealing with and you're dealing with acres.
[37:32.970 --> 37:49.970]  Obviously, that gets a lot harder to do. But I just feel like in IPM in general, I just want people to keep that in their mind that generally a three pronged approach is what is necessary to tackle an issue and and one thing alone is not going to be an answer or solution for you.
[37:54.140 --> 37:55.140]  And I'm completely. Thank you.
[37:56.140 --> 38:09.140]  Awesome. Thank you so much. So again, if you want to come up and ask a question, go ahead. I do have a little bit simpler of a one that I'm going to throw over at you cheddar Bob, while I dig up the next question, which is actually pretty interesting about graphene.
[38:10.140 --> 38:33.140]  So we're gonna talk a little bit and I got some good for Anna, but cheddar Bob, that dude asked, How can I vent my bloom tent without letting light in and I know, like, like, as always, there's no question too big or too small and I'm sure there's been a few people puzzled by this exact problem so cheddar Bob, what's your solutions to this specific issue.
[38:34.140 --> 38:46.140]  Well, I guess, I mean there are these boxes that you can build those like kind of flow hoods that can go over the, the exhaust.
[38:47.140 --> 38:53.140]  But are we talking about like an exhaust fan intake fan is that.
[38:54.140 --> 39:07.140]  Yeah, I think they're exhausting, they're exhausting their space and my guess is they have probably an open hole with a fan in front of it. So what would be your alternative there to make sure to cut off the light so they can manage their bloom site.
[39:09.140 --> 39:15.140]  Yeah, if it's just a fan and you don't have anything kind of leading out like, like the ductwork or something.
[39:16.140 --> 39:20.140]  I would, I would probably look into one of those sort of flow hoods.
[39:23.140 --> 39:32.140]  And if you can put ducting on like an exhaust fan or something, having ducting and then just having it have a bend in it somewhere so it's not able to let in the light.
[39:33.140 --> 39:38.140]  The flow hoods work really good in situations where you can't put ducting on for sure.
[39:39.140 --> 40:02.560]  So, here's, here's the question that I have coming up for you Dr. Anubis I'm pretty sure that'll answer, I think, I think we hit it right on the bone is you just ideally you have some ducting leading in and leading out and you put an S bend in it or something and that will stop the light from getting all the way through.
[40:03.560 --> 40:13.560]  And that that's how you prevent it if you just have a fan, you're, there's not a lot of opportunity there you could put you don't want to put something in front of the fan or by a motor like that because it's not exactly safe.
[40:14.560 --> 40:22.560]  But if you can, you can get pretty deep ducting duct fans, even if it's just a booster and a little bit of ducting, it'll help though.
[40:23.560 --> 40:46.560]  Dr. Anubis, if I graft a low yielding cultivar onto cannabis onto a cultivar with larger yielding root system. Can I get an increased yield, and I, I in theory, like I don't know I don't think information passes between the two other than nutrients so I don't think you would get more of a yield but what would be your opinion on that I know you might not have a solid perfect answer on this because there's a lot of people doing it.
[40:47.560 --> 41:13.560]  You're correct I have no solid answer but I would agree that, you know, the bottom plant with the root system is a separate kind of has a whole separate genome is different cells, different expression than the graft, so I would not expect the higher yielding bottom plant to pass that trait onto the graft.
[41:14.560 --> 41:19.560]  The grafted individual, but I don't really know if that's correct or not.
[41:20.560 --> 41:37.560]  So, I would like 10 just like thinking about it logically be like yes 100%, but after seeing some cactus graphs of some really really slow growing I know it's a different plant and it's a whole different thing completely.
[41:38.560 --> 41:50.560]  The whole different thing completely. But, um, so a cactus that's really slow growing grafted onto a cactus that's fast growing and also can take more water.
[41:51.560 --> 41:54.560]  The cactus that's grafted on top of that plant.
[41:54.560 --> 42:11.560]  The faster growing plant will actually grow substantially faster than it would if it was left to on its own accord. So I'm not sure if that would have there would be any parallels in cannabis, but I wouldn't rule it out completely.
[42:11.560 --> 42:13.560]  I think that's an interesting question.
[42:13.560 --> 42:30.560]  Similar with fruit trees also so I would just be I mean honestly I my question back would be like, well, have you had success with grafting cannabis plants because that's like generally the first thing because it's not sound simple, not actually super simple.
[42:30.560 --> 42:59.560]  I mean I'd love to see like I'd love I want to see more of it I'm kind of been fascinated by it for a long time, especially with like, I still have yet to see in person, cannabis plant hop grafted to like hops root system so I'm like it's kind of fascinating I know that it's happened and there's photography but I'm still, I failed miserably at it and I'm, I'm generally pretty good, have a pretty decent green thumb so obviously I haven't put that much attention to it so I'd be curious if you have any other questions.
[43:01.560 --> 43:15.560]  I agree with you, Evian, and I would also ask the question, what is leading to that I mean if you've grown different strains and this wine just isn't a good performer.
[43:15.560 --> 43:27.560]  Is it because it has, you know, it develops a crappy root system and like it what what's leading to that trait that it's a low yielding plant or a low yielding strain in the first place.
[43:28.560 --> 43:45.560]  If it's, you know, the root system doesn't just doesn't grow big enough for it to uptake what it needs to uptake, you know, then maybe grafting it onto a plant that has the ability to uptake more nutrients more water, whatever may lead to a higher yield but again I'm not sure why.
[43:47.560 --> 43:51.560]  Seems like a lot of work for something that's only around for one growing season.
[43:52.560 --> 44:06.560]  Yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking. It seems like a lot of effort for an annual with a perennial something that's gonna be around for a long time and you have that ability to allow that plant to adapt and adjust and then bear fruit season over season.
[44:07.560 --> 44:24.560]  I can see that I can possibly see the use of it if you're trying to save space and you want to graft a couple of different cultivars onto the same root system so that you only have like one plant instead and and be able to have a couple different flavors from it.
[44:25.560 --> 44:26.560]  Sure, if a plant limit.
[44:26.560 --> 44:55.560]  Yeah, exactly. But I still don't. Other than the fascination right to see if it could be done or, or just to play around. I don't know what you would be gaining through all that effort and to me it would seem to out the amount of additional time that it would take for that plant to take all that adjusting before you would get anything useful for it, you're better you'd probably grow two or three crops in that time and you're probably better off with that.
[44:56.560 --> 44:58.560]  I've never spent time doing that.
[44:59.560 --> 45:25.560]  I have a quick thought to Dr. Anna, I feel like you brought a good point up because this has kind of been interesting point for me and I'd be curious your perception on this and then other people's as well because I feel like there's some misconceptions that like all cannabis is high yielding, whereas my understanding is how it's categorized and I'm not sure how it ties in, you know, on a deeper genetic level of the plant.
[45:26.560 --> 45:54.560]  But my understanding is that there's three different classifications of cannabis and that there's high yielding, medium yielding and low yielding and I kind of feel like this topic of conversation is not really, it's just not it should be more of a conversation because not all genetics are big, big bud strains and a lot of the more exotic stuff and certain things, you know, you can just see it in the structure and I'm sure people who have been growing for a long time kind of know what I'm pointing to.
[45:55.560 --> 46:10.560]  But what I changed my perception when I started to realize there are some genetics that I know that we've run historically, like, you know, something six years in a row and it is never, ever, ever going to yield the same as a high yielding cultivar, no matter what you do.
[46:10.560 --> 46:12.560]  It's just a different structure.
[46:12.560 --> 46:14.560]  It's a different yield.
[46:14.560 --> 46:23.560]  So I just be curious if you have any concept of that within like the kind of deeper construct of what that points to.
[46:25.560 --> 46:45.560]  I really don't, except that, I mean, you're saying that you don't think that there are, like, if you have a highly higher, it's something that has been classified as a high yielding strain.
[46:46.560 --> 46:50.560]  It doesn't always have a high yield or like it varies from year to year.
[46:50.560 --> 46:55.560]  And sometimes, like, I guess I don't understand what you're saying.
[46:55.560 --> 47:03.560]  My understanding, and I believe I learned it, but there's some other plant scientists that I've learned this from the past, is that it's like not all cannabis genetics are created equal.
[47:03.560 --> 47:06.560]  And so there are three different classifications.
[47:06.560 --> 47:11.560]  There are high yielding plants, medium yielding plants and low yielding plants.
[47:11.560 --> 47:23.560]  And I think in the cannabis world, we have this concept that you can get a low yielding cultivar to become like a big bud, high yielding strain just by based on what you're feeding it.
[47:23.560 --> 47:28.560]  But there really is, there's a distinct difference in the genetic structure of those plants.
[47:28.560 --> 47:40.560]  And it's never going to perform like a plant in the low yielding category is never going to perform in the same category as one of the high yielding plants.
[47:40.560 --> 47:46.560]  And so it's kind of it changed my perception because I kind of viewed them for a long time.
[47:46.560 --> 47:48.560]  All is in the same. They're all cannabis plants.
[47:48.560 --> 47:53.560]  They should all be able to do the same thing, but it's just not accurate.
[47:53.560 --> 47:56.560]  And I believe maybe it was I've had this conversation, I think, with Ryan Lee.
[47:56.560 --> 48:07.560]  And it's an interesting because when you grow things historically, it just changed my perception of like how something in the medium or low yielding is just never going to perform the same.
[48:07.560 --> 48:20.560]  And you see this kind of in the data and the metrics when you're harvesting, when you're like, oh, OK, those plants can be treated exactly the same or in a similar preference, but they're just never, they're not going to cross perform, I guess, is the general idea.
[48:20.560 --> 48:35.560]  They're not. They're not. OK, so if you have something that's come from a population that, you know, like if we think back to before we came along and started messing with this plant, you've got a population that's growing and thriving in an area,
[48:35.560 --> 48:42.560]  let's say where it's on a hill and there's a lot of wind. Those plants are going to be small.
[48:42.560 --> 48:49.560]  They're going to adapt to be small because if they were tall, they would bend over or snap and they wouldn't do well in that environment.
[48:49.560 --> 49:02.560]  So that environment has basically driven that phenotype to be shorter in stature so that it can grow well where in the environment that it's living in.
[49:03.560 --> 49:31.560]  So if you have a plant that is a low yielding plant, unless you start crossing it with something else and doing something to it to introduce a genotype that is going to start yielding bigger flowers, it's not in its genome to do that just because of its history and things like that.
[49:31.560 --> 49:41.560]  So you're never going to make a root or allis plant. It's never going to be a photo period plant just because you want it to be or because you put it in a photo period situation.
[49:41.560 --> 49:51.560]  It's an auto flower. It's going to, you know, it's going to flower based on time, based on maturity, not on the light.
[49:52.560 --> 50:01.560]  So a plant can only work with what it has in its genotype. You can't make it express something that it doesn't have.
[50:01.560 --> 50:15.560]  So I would agree with what you said that a low yielding plant is, it's always going to be a low yielder and you might be able to get it to perform a little better if you give it the optimal conditions and whatnot.
[50:15.560 --> 50:18.560]  But it's never going to be a high yielding plant.
[50:20.560 --> 50:31.560]  And what else? I just thought of something else. Oh, like, you know, if you have a ladyfinger banana, it's never going to, you're never going to be able to grow big taquita bananas. It's a different kind of banana.
[50:31.560 --> 50:37.560]  And they're always going to be small. So unless you cross it with a bigger banana, you're not going to get a bigger banana.
[50:38.560 --> 50:47.560]  I think this needs to be shouted from the rooftops because I think people just don't under, I think people just expect all Canada and it's like they see subtle variations, but they're like, well, why doesn't it perform?
[50:47.560 --> 50:53.560]  Like, why does the cookies not yield as much as a train wreck? Or, you know, it's just like, it's just never going to be the same.
[50:53.560 --> 51:00.560]  So it's just an interesting thing that I feel like is maybe not discussed enough. So it kind of begs back to the question.
[51:01.560 --> 51:08.560]  But the user was like that, you know, unless you're going to, I would say you'd have better luck.
[51:08.560 --> 51:24.560]  Like Dr. Anna saying is like crossing those two things. If you want to increase the yield of that one plant, you know, work with a breeder or learn basic breeding and cross those two genetics and see if you can create progeny that gives you the desired result.
[51:25.560 --> 51:30.560]  It's absolutely one of the things that a lot of the breeders do focus on and they actually talk about as well.
[51:30.560 --> 51:51.560]  I've worked with my buddy, Tom, Green Team Genetics. I've helped at his booth a couple of times and, you know, some of his crosses, he had four different crosses and two were, one was banana, you know, banana and a strawberry and orange and a lemon.
[51:52.560 --> 52:03.560]  So these, he did these, this fruit bound series and those four cultivars, the lemon and the orange were much higher yielding plants.
[52:04.560 --> 52:15.560]  The strawberry and the banana though were not and strawberry strains, a lot of the time you tend to get a lot of golf ball sized nugs. You don't really get necessarily the big spears.
[52:16.560 --> 52:29.560]  So it's definitely genetic and you can see it in the crosses and even stuff coming from the same breeder will show those different tendencies even if they had similar parentage, right?
[52:30.560 --> 52:43.560]  You know, it was one line he did, this fruit bound series where all the, you know, all the parents, all the females were crossed to the same male for these four different flavors and he got, you know, you're going to get different yields.
[52:44.560 --> 52:48.560]  You're going to get different bud shapes. The colas themselves are going to have different shapes.
[52:49.560 --> 52:55.560]  You have like big spears or, you know, you're going to get those popcorn, those rounded, you know, buds.
[52:56.560 --> 53:12.560]  I know Kyle Breeder of Pure Breeding also, he breeds a lot of his stuff where he's trying to, you know, he focuses more on plants that are going to be good for indoor growers in many cases that are going to stay shorter.
[53:12.560 --> 53:21.560]  A lot of his plants, they're just bushes and it doesn't matter how long I veg it or what I do to it, it's not going to get six feet tall.
[53:22.560 --> 53:26.560]  It's going to stay three feet and just keep getting wider and wider.
[53:27.560 --> 53:34.560]  So there's definitely some genetic aspects to that and I've seen that even way back in the day.
[53:34.560 --> 53:53.560]  And I think this is also something that has limited some of the genetic variances and availabilities that are out there because, again, if we're focusing on a cash crop, the amount of yield that that plant puts out is going to have an impact on whether somebody continues to grow it.
[53:54.560 --> 54:04.560]  And so we've lost a lot of flavors and strains because people who are working in commercial space are very much focused on that yield percent, that yield amount.
[54:05.560 --> 54:06.560]  This is Jason, I'm done speaking.
[54:07.560 --> 54:09.560]  That's such an amazing point.
[54:10.560 --> 54:32.560]  If I can just throw in here as a point of reference, so the popping corn that you go to the movie theater, you love oh so much, the corn you see on your table, the popping corn you buy over the counter regular, 98%, I believe it is, I might be off by a few percent here, of corn produced in North America is the cross of two plants, period.
[54:33.560 --> 54:40.560]  And the only reason why this specific plant was chosen is due to the fact of its yield.
[54:41.560 --> 54:48.560]  Nothing to do with flavor, nothing to do with quality, only the fact that it had the highest yield per square foot, period.
[54:49.560 --> 54:53.560]  So it had nothing to do with how it feels or what it does or how good it is for you.
[54:54.560 --> 54:55.560]  The only root factor is yield.
[54:56.560 --> 55:09.560]  So when we look at industry, this is always a problem that we run into, and Jason highlighted it oh so well, is that it's all about the yield and how much money I can make and not what's actually there, the bastardization of plants as it were.
[55:10.560 --> 55:14.560]  So I do want to jump over and ask Jason another question, although on a slightly different subject.
[55:15.560 --> 55:19.560]  Brooke Brown asks, and I think this is awesome because you did a show on this.
[55:20.560 --> 55:28.560]  Brock Braun asks, I figured silica was covered, but what's an organic way to get more silica into your system?
[55:29.560 --> 55:33.560]  Jason, I know you did a whole subject show on that, I'm wondering if you could talk on that a little bit.
[55:34.560 --> 55:43.560]  So there's definitely a lot of things out there that can be covered in silica and silicate.
[55:44.560 --> 55:55.560]  Definitely go back and listen to my episode that we did specifically on silica and all the different ways that you can get it.
[55:56.560 --> 56:19.560]  But some really, really good ways to get additional silica naturally that you can add, there's things like aragonite, which is a sea-based calcium that's high in calcium and low in magnesium and has some other really, really nice additional aspects in it.
[56:20.560 --> 56:22.560]  And that's a calcium silicate.
[56:22.560 --> 56:38.560]  One of the things that I really like to use is calcareous algae flour, which is about 32% calcium and has a whole bunch of fantastic amino acids in there as well.
[56:39.560 --> 56:44.560]  And that's C-A-L-C-A-R-E-O-U-S algae flour.
[56:45.560 --> 56:49.560]  So algae, you know, A-L-G-A-E, and of course flour.
[56:49.560 --> 56:51.560]  So those are a couple of different ways.
[56:52.560 --> 56:55.560]  I also am a big proponent of rice hulls.
[56:56.560 --> 57:03.560]  Rice hulls, as they break down, they do release silicon because it's part of, you know, what's in them.
[57:04.560 --> 57:10.560]  We talked a little bit about whether there's much silicon in brown rice vinegar.
[57:11.560 --> 57:12.560]  There is not.
[57:13.560 --> 57:19.560]  It is that the shells, the husks themselves is where that material is.
[57:20.560 --> 57:27.560]  It's not necessarily in the outputs that come from like the vinegar or the core of the rice itself.
[57:28.560 --> 57:31.560]  So that's a couple of places that you can get that.
[57:32.560 --> 57:43.560]  Oyster shells are mostly calcium, but they have a lot of silicates in there as well.
[57:44.560 --> 57:56.560]  It's really trying to get some of those sea creatures because they have the silicates in them as well to add that in with your calcium and your silicon inputs.
[57:57.560 --> 57:58.560]  So hopefully that helped.
[58:01.560 --> 58:07.560]  Another great plant that has high silica, it would be horsetails or equisetum.
[58:08.560 --> 58:14.560]  That is something that I'm beginning to look at to start fermenting and incorporating it into my garden.
[58:15.560 --> 58:24.560]  It's a fantastic bioaccumulator and definitely one of the items that's highlighted in a lot of Korean natural farming guides to use.
[58:28.040 --> 58:30.040]  Little palm tree too.
[58:34.620 --> 58:39.620]  All right, so I will do a quick reset here just so everybody knows what's up and what's going on.
[58:40.620 --> 58:47.620]  I think we should have like a whole show about plants, about side plants, like all the other plants that we can put together.
[58:48.620 --> 58:49.620]  That would be so fun.
[58:50.620 --> 59:01.620]  I think it'd be so cool to get like, if we could get like a doctor on exudates and a doctor on microbiology around the root system and fungi and then a plant doctor.
[59:01.620 --> 59:02.620]  Yeah, no, that's the goal.
[59:03.620 --> 59:04.620]  We're working on it every day.
[59:05.620 --> 59:30.620]  And PotenPonic's mentioned, I think it was one of the conversations in the last couple nights, he's putting together a whole library of those plant to nutrient conversions for natural farmers so that they can pick and choose from a variety of things to help get the inputs that they're looking for, the types of minerals or the nutrients that they're looking for.
[59:31.620 --> 59:34.620]  Steve Reisner, PotenPonic's Growing with Fishes.
[59:35.620 --> 59:40.620]  He's a fantastic resource as well for that type of information.
[59:41.620 --> 59:46.620]  And he is putting together a whole file on it.
[59:47.620 --> 59:49.620]  And I think he actually just sent me a link to it.
[59:50.620 --> 59:55.620]  I haven't had a chance to dive in there yet, but I'm really excited to take a look at what he's put together so far.
[59:56.620 --> 59:58.620]  That's going to be a fantastic resource.
[59:59.620 --> 01:00:04.620]  Awesome. So I got a fun, handy question that I'm going to throw over to Matt here.
[01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:08.620]  And I think it's great. It's nice and simple.
[01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:14.620]  But also, you know, a question that a lot of people ran into in the earlier time that I think it's really important to get onto.
[01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:22.620]  Hi, from Virginia, Paige Foley says, when using plastic pots and saucers, I set up netting.
[01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:26.620]  How do I drain my flushes without moving the plant?
[01:00:26.620 --> 01:00:34.620]  So my guess is that she's probably in like a drain to waste where she's looking at 20% runoff of the plant.
[01:00:35.620 --> 01:00:38.620]  And she's wondering like how to mitigate that because you don't want your plant sitting in the water.
[01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:45.620]  Matt, do you have any, you know, methodologies of navigating this issue?
[01:00:46.620 --> 01:00:53.620]  Honestly, I'd probably say, I mean, I haven't done runoff in a while, but I'd say trays.
[01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:57.620]  Or if you can't do trays, get stands.
[01:00:58.620 --> 01:01:08.620]  And then if you're kind of in a tent, that's what those first like layers are designed for is to like gain water.
[01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:14.620]  So you can go and get Home Depot has these awesome, they're like, I think like $15.
[01:01:15.620 --> 01:01:17.620]  It's like a shop vac that goes inside of like a five gallon bucket.
[01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:27.620]  And you can put your plant, your like stands up on that, do your water through and then use the shop vac to suck up any like excess water.
[01:01:28.620 --> 01:01:33.620]  But that would probably be my go to like if you didn't have access to a tray.
[01:01:34.620 --> 01:01:41.620]  The shop vac is great actually for getting around and just sucking the extra water out of the bottoms of the saucers as well.
[01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:51.620]  So I know, you know, if the plant, sometimes the plants are too heavy to move or to lift, you can just go ahead and suck the water out of there is one way.
[01:01:52.620 --> 01:01:55.620]  There's also, you know, I mean, there's hand siphons that you can get as well.
[01:01:56.620 --> 01:02:08.620]  They don't necessarily work as well, but you can go to the local hardware store and get a siphon that's used for fuel or something along those lines that you can use to pump it out by hand if you don't want to buy a shop vac.
[01:02:09.620 --> 01:02:21.240]  Interesting. Now, sorry, I have my mic open for an extra minute there.
[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:26.240]  My apologies for that if I interrupted you, but I'm just scanning through the questions.
[01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:28.240]  I'll do a quick reset while we're running into this.
[01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:33.240]  And I think those are excellent points. If you have no money and a turkey baster, get a bucket.
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:38.240]  Good way to start. If you need to fix the problem right now.
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:44.240]  Yeah, I mean, you know, I haven't, I've had occasionally I've sat there with a sponge.
[01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:56.240]  I won't lie. Like I didn't have anything that I could use handy and I just used a sponge and a bucket and just kept using the sponge to suck up the extra water and just squeeze it out into a bucket.
[01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:59.240]  I mean, that's sometimes you have to go really, really manual.
[01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:02.240]  That's dedication right there.
[01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:08.240]  I will say I don't know how anybody even operates like growing anything like shop vacs are so valuable.
[01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:13.240]  And now they have like that little like mini ones and stuff for people who are operating at a really small home scale.
[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:20.240]  So I feel like shot and also just being super. I just want to say on the shop vac thing, just make sure you clean it out after every use.
[01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:27.240]  Because that's like the really just seems to kind of be like become practice.
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:34.240]  That's why I talk about those ones that come deep like one day like, you know, I think mine had broke or something like that.
[01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:39.240]  And I was walking through and I saw this one that just like clips on top of the five gallon buckets.
[01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:43.240]  And I was like, that's super cheap. I'm going to try it. And I haven't gone away from them.
[01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:48.240]  Like almost every grow that I've worked in, I've brought them in and you can buy a bunch of them for super cheap.
[01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:52.240]  And, you know, you'll get the work out of it, even if it breaks.
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:56.240]  I've sucked up like pumice rocks with them and stuff and they don't seem to break that often.
[01:03:57.240 --> 01:03:59.240]  But even if it does, it's like I feel like you'd get your money's worth.
[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:06.240]  But yeah, they're I think one of the most useful tools to do and pick up soil, water, anything you need.
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:15.800]  So I'm just going to say we have about we like to end this at about an hour and a half.
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:18.800]  We usually end at about 530 in the evening.
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:23.800]  So we get lots of time to jump into dinner for those that are on the West Coast.
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:27.800]  If you're on the East Coast, it's a good bad dinner. I'm not too worried about you.
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:34.800]  If you have any questions in the Future Cannabis Project side, or you have any questions in the audience,
[01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:37.800]  come on up because we're approaching the last roundabout hour to ask them.
[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:40.800]  No question too big, no question too small.
[01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:45.800]  Maybe a comment or something that you would like to discuss that's been picking or nagging at your brain.
[01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:49.800]  And maybe there's a way that we could chat through it and develop that.
[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:52.800]  But again, we got about 20 minutes left. So don't miss out on that part.
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:54.800]  I see some more comments in the chat.
[01:04:55.800 --> 01:05:01.800]  Magnus asked a little bit earlier about where did you go?
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:06.800]  He was asking about using Swartzki mites if I'm off.
[01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:14.800]  Yes, Swartzki mites and opening up the sachet and depositing them in the soil to use that as a tool.
[01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:18.800]  A defensive means for dealing with fungus gnats.
[01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:23.800]  I'm not familiar of this. I'm pretty sure they just end up going right back up top.
[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:27.800]  But I think the first person jumped in. Jason, go ahead, brother.
[01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:31.800]  Yeah, I'm happy to take that. Anything that's in a sachet is usually in a sachet for a reason.
[01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:34.800]  They're meant to be a slow release.
[01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:43.800]  And so they're usually eggs and yeast and things in there to maintain the Swartzki eye or cucamorous or whatever the package is.
[01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:45.800]  So they're usually meant to be slow release.
[01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:52.800]  And so if you take them out and dump them out, you're going to lose probably a large portion of your population.
[01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:57.800]  So after the period that those sachets are supposed to be done.
[01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:03.800]  So the cucamorous sachets that I use, for instance, are supposed to last about five weeks.
[01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:08.800]  Once that five week period is over, absolutely cut them open, dump them out.
[01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:13.800]  Usually it's really, really the one the cucamorous comes that I buy comes with.
[01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:18.800]  It's kind of like a brand meal. So that's fantastic for the soil. Just let it go.
[01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:27.800]  So that's that's my advice with the with the sachets is you want to try to keep them going for the life period that they're supposed to be good for.
[01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:30.800]  And then you're free to take them and dump them out.
[01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:35.800]  You can dust them over your plants and all those things as well.
[01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:54.960]  I just want to cycle back to what we said at the beginning of the conversation earlier when we were talking about root aphids is just to be reminded that one fungus snap flyer can lay about 300 eggs and larva at a time.
[01:06:55.960 --> 01:07:01.960]  So just make sure that like the balance, like you have a balance, whatever you're doing when you're trying to treat a problem like that.
[01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:11.960]  And also when you're we were speaking earlier to if you're if you have an issue, the more complex the three pronged approach is great.
[01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:24.960]  But when you have things that have a more complex life cycle and fungus nuts are one of those things that have a complex life cycle, not as complex as like thrips or something where it's like a six or seven part life cycle.
[01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:30.960]  But, you know, fungus nuts have a pretty complex life cycle where they're in the soil and they're in the air.
[01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:41.960]  And so you definitely want to make sure that you're you're making whatever approach you're using that is actually targeting all the different parts of the life cycle.
[01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:45.960]  That's another amazing. Fantastic. Yeah.
[01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:50.960]  Like was exactly depending on your pest, you have different issues.
[01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:54.960]  Like you talk about aphids, they're essentially born pregnant.
[01:07:55.960 --> 01:08:01.960]  Like the whole gestation cycle there is quite like quite a quite a task.
[01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:02.960]  So glad you brought that up.
[01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:08.960]  I think such a good point is depending on the pest, like you might have to attack a completely different way to like.
[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:10.960]  Yeah. Awesome.
[01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:27.430]  OK, so let's see here. Do we have another question coming on the far end?
[01:08:28.430 --> 01:08:30.430]  Cool. Thank you. Magnus says thank you very much for the smile.
[01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:34.430]  JB says H Miles forget for Nat. That's good.
[01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:39.430]  So HUSO asks is is star killer something that's well known in the US?
[01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:45.430]  My guess is that is I think I've heard of this stream before.
[01:08:46.430 --> 01:08:49.430]  Is this something anybody in the audience is anybody on the panel is familiar?
[01:08:49.430 --> 01:08:50.430]  Go ahead, Evian.
[01:08:51.430 --> 01:08:57.430]  Yeah, it's been around for a little bit and it's it's OK.
[01:08:58.430 --> 01:09:03.430]  I mean, it's not something that like blew me out of the water personally, but like it's it's it's around.
[01:09:08.490 --> 01:09:15.490]  Not not something I have tons of commentary on, but it's like, yeah, it's it's it's here.
[01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:28.560]  All right. Do we have we have another question that comes to David Purcell asks.
[01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:31.560]  What's the best light for under four hundred dollars?
[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:38.560]  And what's what what what's a great option if I have an unlimited budget but a small space?
[01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:42.560]  What would be your recommendations? Cheddar Bob, you want to go?
[01:09:48.970 --> 01:09:49.970]  Cheddar Bob is in terrible. I'm sorry.
[01:09:50.970 --> 01:09:53.970]  So he might be a little bit. I'm sorry. Say that again.
[01:09:54.970 --> 01:10:04.970]  Best budget light to get rolling that you might suggest and and a light that you would if you had unlimited money, what would you get for lighting in it?
[01:10:06.970 --> 01:10:17.140]  Oh, boy. Gee, best budget lighting, you know, depending on your space.
[01:10:18.140 --> 01:10:24.140]  Personally, I think that like a three 15 cmh is a good way to start.
[01:10:25.140 --> 01:10:32.140]  You know, it doesn't release as much heat as the the high pressure sodium or such.
[01:10:33.140 --> 01:10:35.140]  And it does have a really nice spectrum.
[01:10:36.140 --> 01:10:42.140]  If I were going to go with unlimited funds and stuff, personally, I'm a I'm a fluent guy.
[01:10:42.140 --> 01:10:44.140]  So that's that's sort of my go to.
[01:10:46.140 --> 01:10:48.140]  That's yeah, that's it.
[01:10:51.140 --> 01:11:03.140]  Yeah, I just want to back up what Cheddar Bob saying there, because I feel like, you know, as far as low budget, I definitely have like people who are also sourcing things outside of brand names.
[01:11:04.140 --> 01:11:12.140]  So sometimes you can find like the exact same lighting setup for, you know, without the brand name on there.
[01:11:13.140 --> 01:11:15.140]  So that's kind of something to consider when you're looking.
[01:11:16.140 --> 01:11:18.140]  But also, I'm a big fan of fluency.
[01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:24.140]  If you if money is no object, that's kind of where I tend to pivot towards.
[01:11:24.140 --> 01:11:32.050]  When you need to be careful of your space to especially in small spaces, because you can only use so much light.
[01:11:33.050 --> 01:11:37.050]  And so the sizing of the light is usually appropriate.
[01:11:38.050 --> 01:11:40.050]  The three 15 is a great starter light.
[01:11:41.050 --> 01:11:46.050]  I mean, if you're really talking small light, I've seen people do fantastic things with CFLs and a footlocker.
[01:11:47.050 --> 01:11:52.050]  So, you know, it really depends on how small your space is and how low your budget is.
[01:11:52.050 --> 01:11:59.050]  If you've got an old chandelier and some CFL lights, you can actually make a, you know, and do a pretty good grow.
[01:12:00.050 --> 01:12:03.050]  It's really about the setup and how you're trying to do it.
[01:12:04.050 --> 01:12:05.050]  But CMH is a good starter light.
[01:12:06.050 --> 01:12:09.050]  They're extremely cheap because most people are buying LEDs these days.
[01:12:10.050 --> 01:12:11.050]  So you can definitely get a discount there.
[01:12:12.050 --> 01:12:19.050]  But if I was going to spend some money, I would I would go look at the some of the spectrum tunable lights as well.
[01:12:19.050 --> 01:12:21.050]  Fluence makes a good white light.
[01:12:22.050 --> 01:12:40.050]  But if you really want to play around and be able to tune the spectrum and have a sunset and a sunrise and do some other things, there's some other lighting companies out there that have some really amazing stuff like Science LED, for instance, which is the lighting company that I use and work with.
[01:12:41.050 --> 01:12:49.050]  Bruce Bugbee is actually doing a huge amount, is doing a bunch of work with them now, who's an amazing scientist.
[01:12:50.050 --> 01:12:55.050]  And they also were included in Ed's book, his recent updates to his grower's guide.
[01:12:56.050 --> 01:12:58.050]  So look into spectrum tuning.
[01:12:59.050 --> 01:13:10.050]  And if you have the space, you can try to find our good friend Sun who's on here often, who has a light that actually is actually replicates the sun indoors.
[01:13:11.050 --> 01:13:14.050]  But you have to have a very big space because those lights are not meant for small space.
[01:13:15.050 --> 01:13:16.050]  So that's my that's my.
[01:13:17.050 --> 01:13:19.050]  Is that the is that the sun on demand?
[01:13:20.050 --> 01:13:21.050]  Yeah.
[01:13:21.050 --> 01:13:23.050]  If you were if you were to, you know, I've totally blanked on that.
[01:13:24.050 --> 01:13:29.050]  That is probably like the premier lighting system that that one would work.
[01:13:30.050 --> 01:13:31.050]  But you need you need space.
[01:13:32.050 --> 01:13:34.050]  You need space because you can't use that in like a tent.
[01:13:36.050 --> 01:13:44.050]  You need it. You need you need a space with some considerable ceiling room and you need you need a good canopy that you're going to use a light like that on.
[01:13:45.050 --> 01:13:54.050]  So I'd like to make a recommendation on just a cheaper LED fixture that for the price point, they're really good.
[01:13:55.050 --> 01:13:56.050]  Their customer service is good.
[01:13:57.050 --> 01:14:00.050]  And I use it one of their lights for my smaller little grow tent.
[01:14:01.050 --> 01:14:06.050]  And it's dimmable as well as like an on on the unit dimmer, which is great.
[01:14:07.050 --> 01:14:09.050]  So you can dim it as you need.
[01:14:09.050 --> 01:14:17.050]  And it is a actually a Mars Hydro, which a few years ago I would not have recommended you Mars Hydro.
[01:14:18.050 --> 01:14:23.050]  But now they have some white lights that are just they're really good for their price point.
[01:14:24.050 --> 01:14:31.050]  So, like I said, and you can use them in a smaller environment and you can dim them so you could be growing in.
[01:14:32.050 --> 01:14:33.050]  Yeah, pretty much like a locker.
[01:14:33.050 --> 01:14:38.050]  Like Jason was saying, you can have these these things super close to the plants turned way down.
[01:14:39.050 --> 01:14:48.050]  They're really energy efficient and you won't have to worry about heating or cooling or you won't have to worry about cooling your space, which is really, really nice.
[01:14:49.050 --> 01:15:00.050]  I mean, I wouldn't even say Mars Hydro, you know, like it's it's that, you know, like bad to say back in the day, you know, like the 2015 2014 era when.
[01:15:00.050 --> 01:15:08.050]  When these things really started coming around, it was like Vipar and Mars that were kind of like leading the way.
[01:15:09.050 --> 01:15:15.050]  And I watched a lot of guys on Reddit on like Graphic City and stuff that were pulling damn good yields.
[01:15:16.050 --> 01:15:18.050]  It just took a little bit of like, you know, like dialing it in.
[01:15:19.050 --> 01:15:26.050]  And so you like and I say like damn good yields, I guess I should say for the science that they were that they had at the time.
[01:15:27.050 --> 01:15:29.050]  And for like what they were paying for the light.
[01:15:30.050 --> 01:15:32.050]  Like there was like some some pretty good stuff.
[01:15:33.050 --> 01:15:44.050]  So like that whole like Mars Hydro and like Vipar like Spectra, like I think even Doc Ray, he runs like we were talking a couple of weeks ago.
[01:15:45.050 --> 01:15:50.050]  He runs Vipar Spectras for a lot of his veg like stuff.
[01:15:50.050 --> 01:15:57.050]  So like there's some of those like cheaper and like LEDs that are coming up pretty quickly.
[01:15:58.050 --> 01:16:10.050]  And then the only other thing I'd say about lighting is, is, especially when you're starting to spend more, really, really see like where they're getting their research data from.
[01:16:10.050 --> 01:16:25.050]  And if they have it like if the company doesn't have their data accessible, like if you follow me, I jokingly like post this quite often is like the lighting industry is much like the seed industry.
[01:16:26.050 --> 01:16:27.050]  It's a very snake oil.
[01:16:28.050 --> 01:16:31.050]  There's actually very few people that are producing real research data.
[01:16:32.050 --> 01:16:39.050]  And you can tell this by you'll go to the website and they just don't have anything or they don't like they have no kind of explanation on why their light does what it does.
[01:16:40.050 --> 01:16:43.050]  And if they don't, you know, like if they can't say that I would not buy it.
[01:16:43.050 --> 01:16:49.050]  Or if you call them and talk to them, and they don't really have like a lighting scientist or anything going on.
[01:16:50.050 --> 01:16:54.050]  I'd maybe shop around a little bit and just kind of like per house and see kind of what else is out there.
[01:16:55.050 --> 01:17:09.050]  I think, I think, I just want to say super quick I just want to say that also the very first question that I always ask is like, you know, dependent on whether somebody is looking at LEDs or a different sources is also like your power.
[01:17:09.050 --> 01:17:38.050]  Just the very first thing because I will just say that I've tripped breakers with pretty much everything in my day and like, yeah, so just just gonna say that right out the gate is just really, really knowing your power source, even if you're at a very small scale because even just like basic lighting if you're daily chaining things together or whatever you will you will trip breakers and making sure you know, know your power source and make sure that you're with the right people.
[01:17:40.050 --> 01:17:45.050]  Well, I think you could also say it could get dangerous, you can burn down your house.
[01:17:45.050 --> 01:17:46.050]  Oh, for sure.
[01:17:49.050 --> 01:17:55.050]  Like sometimes the breaker doesn't trip and then that wire gets really hot and then done, done, done.
[01:17:56.050 --> 01:18:23.050]  For me I often, there's one thing that I was actually just in here jumped in and said the same thing is kind of, what is your space dealing with like where you're drawing air from is it hotter is it cold, the hotter your environment is and the more challenging is to get that temperature down, the more you're probably going to want to lean into something like an LED, the cooler your airspace is and the easier it is to cool things down.
[01:18:24.050 --> 01:18:42.050]  The easier it's going to be to use traditional lighting that generate a lot more heat, but it really depends on your environment I think this is awesome we have to press now we do have an exciting one here and I think this will be a great way to finish up the evening as with with our last panelists for the day, but what I have.
[01:18:43.050 --> 01:18:45.050]  Sorry, I just want to make sure I get a name right.
[01:18:46.050 --> 01:19:04.050]  James Perkins, James Perkins asks, and I got this by email James Perkins asked I'm very excited to get growing this year, or the summer season. What can I do to get started. I live in Oregon coast.
[01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:13.280]  Maybe I would like to jump over to Matt to maybe if you want to have some recommendations.
[01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:17.280]  Sorry I was looking at a chat and all I heard was Oregon coast and I was like what.
[01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:20.280]  Can you say the question again I apologize.
[01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:31.280]  We have an excited grower looking to get started for this year, they're wondering when they should put down seeds and or if they should just start looking for them or if they should start thinking about putting them down.
[01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:52.280]  Well, first off, I mean, getting them out, you're going to be like after the middle of April and honestly depending on how big you really want the plants and where you are on the coast if it's like North Coast, Central Coast or like South Coast kind of really matters on like how soon you'll have to harvest.
[01:19:53.280 --> 01:20:09.280]  So, you kind of have this like window of like figuring out if the strain will finish and a lot of people like in the northern area grow a lot of like the finest like cultivars, because they're pretty quick, like flowering.
[01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:38.280]  But I guess you're going to want to be out, you know, like after like mid April, or sorry mid mid like June, and then be like, like, looking to like start wrapping everything up around like the beginning of September, honestly, or like middle, middle or like end of like September is like when you like you should start hoping that like things are getting really underway.
[01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:55.280]  And a lot of people out here on the coast do light, do light depth for this reason, but seed wise Eugene has an amazing amount of stores that have seeds local a lot of the dispensaries carry them.
[01:20:55.280 --> 01:21:06.280]  A lot of the coastal shops do in Tillamook and the store in Manzanita and a few of them in Astoria do as well.
[01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:10.280]  And Eugene, also is a fantastic source a lot of the stores there.
[01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:15.280]  And I keep bringing it up because it's a little bit more central, so I'm not sure where you are on the coast.
[01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:27.280]  Eugene is an amazing source for clones to like if you don't want to go from seed, you can just quickly go find some clones and plant those down, which is kind of nice.
[01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:49.280]  I think that's great advice, Matt and I would also add that, you know, just really making sure there are some genetics that do very well I mean my first questions would be like how many plants are you thinking, and are you planning on, you know, do you have some sort of greenhouse space, where do you want to start your seeds inside outside.
[01:21:50.280 --> 01:22:12.280]  You know there's a lot of different questions and if you're really doing small scale, or different things but just what works well on the coast versus what works well inland, there are definitely some genetics that have been bred specifically for the coast so I'd be curious Matt if you have any experience with that I know I can think of quite a few different, like different things but I kind of would need like that.
[01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:15.280]  Generally I love to know more.
[01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:18.280]  So it's hard when people are on YouTube because I like want to quiz people.
[01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:29.280]  I don't know, like I'm just going to give a like a roundabout. The only ones I know on the coast that really, at least from from this area, or
[01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:38.280]  the Royal Highness that crosses that's what like everybody out here like seems to grow, but
[01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:47.280]  I don't know if there's more stuff in like the southern coast kind of really clicky out here like a very small logging town well I'm sure you know.
[01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:58.280]  But yeah it's a but uh yeah I'm not fully sure on what a lot of people are growing, to be honest.
[01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:22.280]  I would, being from the coast in Maine and dealing with, you know that that coastal issue of fog and high humidity towards flower. I've found that the Royal Cush lines offer a higher amount of like PM resistance, as well as bud rot. So that's one cultivar you could you could look into.
[01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:33.280]  On top of choosing cultivars, you know, carefully for that environment where it's kind of humid and you're going to get lots of fog.
[01:23:34.280 --> 01:23:43.280]  Something that also you should maybe consider would be starting to learn how if you don't already produce lactic acid bacteria.
[01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:58.280]  So you could start incorporating that in your, your garden and your, your regimen and doing a weekly or, you know, twice a week preventative spray that stuff will will help tremendously in that kind of humid coastal environment.
[01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:03.280]  Brian, welcome to this stage. Do you have a question or comment for our panel?
[01:24:07.580 --> 01:24:13.580]  Yes, I was having the same problem getting my plants to grow.
[01:24:14.580 --> 01:24:41.580]  Yes, I was having the same problem getting my plants to finish here in Oregon, which you're talking about. I'm growing in a greenhouse, and I don't know it's not really practical for me to do light depth.
[01:24:41.580 --> 01:24:57.580]  And I'm wondering if anybody knows if it's possible to do what I've been trying to do, which is to supplement the sunlight in such a way that I can extend my growing season and and get them to finish.
[01:24:58.580 --> 01:25:12.560]  I would also say just starting earlier, Brian, I think I've spoken with you before about that kind of issue, because I feel like especially if you're in a greenhouse, I would say like trying to push.
[01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:40.560]  And sometimes, you know, it just depends on the year. Some years in Oregon, we have sunnier springs and some years we don't. So it kind of is like a little bit of a crapshoot, but I feel like adding supplemental light at the beginning of the season and then sort of, you know, there's various ways that you can keep your greenhouse from freezing if you don't have heat, you know, just by using
[01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:44.560]  I don't know what your setup is like.
[01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:46.560]  I have heat.
[01:25:47.560 --> 01:26:03.560]  You have heat. So if you have heat, I would say, honestly, it's much easier to add supplemental light, like less light required if you're doing it in veg. And I was really impressed by, you know, just how early we've been able to kind of push things in the beginning of the year.
[01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:27.560]  Yeah, I ran HIDs in there. And this last year, I ran them most of the year, partly because, you know, it's chilly. It's chilly and keeps my greenhouse warm. I just usually do it in the morning and a little in the evening. I kind of tapered off during the hot weather. I also have LEDs. Sometimes I use those.
[01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:43.560]  But I don't know, it just seemed like I could simulate a longer growing season somehow just by dealing with the environment in such a way that, you know, thinks I'm in Southern California or something.
[01:26:44.560 --> 01:27:03.560]  What are the, what's the week on your genetic? Oh, sorry. Sorry, Matt. But just really quick, just if you could tell us like the, like, what are these like longer? Because I tend to find straight away from, you know, I don't know. It just depends on what you're doing. But as far as like the longer, if you're looking at a 12 week cultivar, then obviously you're going to have more issues.
[01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:25.560]  I'm a big fan of quicks, especially these last years with the smoke and stuff. I'm not sure where you are in Oregon, but we've had to deal with, you know, different levels of smoke and that affects light as well. So I'm just, I've been kind of depending on where you're putting your production or what you're doing. What are you looking at on your weeks?
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:52.560]  Well, I've actually been, it's been just take what I can get at the dispensary because I've been running clones every year, but I have ordered a bunch of seeds. I've already got a bunch of them. I'm planning to, if it works out to just do everything from seed this year, instead of doing the clones, because they don't, I don't really get any choice. You know, you take what you get.
[01:27:55.080 --> 01:28:16.080]  That was going to be my question was the times, because I'll say, so 2017 I grew White Widow and it finished a little too late, but because White Widow is super kind of like vigorous, it took it. That's partially why I did it. And then didn't do anything 2018.
[01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:41.080]  2019 I did Critical 2.0 and Lavender Outdoors. I did a Domino year too, I think in somewhere. But essentially, oh, and then I did also a Heavy Grapefruit in 2019 as well, a run outside and a couple others from BC Seeds. And that's honestly, if you can source a lot of your genetics from like BC,
[01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:57.080]  like that's going to be some of your best bet because they're dealing with a lot of the same kind of climate, like bioregion issues that we are, not issues, but the same kind of environment that we are out here on the coast.
[01:28:57.080 --> 01:29:16.080]  But I guess that's what I ran. You know, like if that helps is White Widow, some Critical 2.0, and then Domino strains or the Black Domino, Heavy Grapefruit. And then I can get the list for you, Brian, and send it to you of the stuff I grew from BC Seeds.
[01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:18.080]  Yeah, that makes sense.
[01:29:46.080 --> 01:30:10.080]  I mean, the one thing about seeds that I will say is I'm a huge fan. I mean, obviously, like my Instagram handle is sister of the seed. I love seeds. I'm like a giant believer. I just feel like you will end up with more phenotypic variation. And so depending on what your goal is, if that doesn't matter to you, I love growing seed plants.
[01:30:11.080 --> 01:30:28.080]  If I had a choice, that's all I would grow. But I do find that if you're trying to produce something that, you know, for production, it's very difficult to do, because you end up with more phenotypic variations. So you end up with different, you know, if you want consistency, it's not always the best bet, unfortunately.
[01:30:29.080 --> 01:30:39.080]  Yeah, and Roseburg, I think most of the clones are probably some, I mean, they must be from Oregon, right? Because they can't do it from out of state.
[01:30:39.080 --> 01:30:42.080]  Everything you get at the dispensaries will come from Oregon.
[01:30:43.080 --> 01:31:03.080]  Right. And so this year, with the seeds, I have done what you said. I didn't think about ordering from BC seeds, but I have ordered, I tried to order from Oregon. And I don't really know what I've got off the top of my head. But yeah, I'll have to look for shorter flower times.
[01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:11.080]  Although I've had great results with what I've got here. It's just that they don't always make it all the way.
[01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:28.080]  I think Evian, I think you got an awesome avenue there. Evian being in Oregon and planting so many seeds and planting so many plants, I'm sure her company provides a lot of awesome stuff for the market. So if there's anybody in the world that I would love to get some plants from.
[01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:45.080]  It's you, Evian. Unfortunately, you can't ship them up to Canada. But one of these days, one of these days it will be possible. We are coming to the hour and 30 minutes. Did we answer your question to completion? Did we go as deep as the root aphid does today for you, Brian?
[01:31:46.080 --> 01:32:03.080]  Yes, with one exception, since the problem I have here is they sell out so fast with the clones. If I was looking for seeds, would I drive to Eugene or somewhere like that? Because I don't really see much around here.
[01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:16.080]  You can come just out of Oregon too. I mean, there's places in Eugene, but if you're in Roseburg, you're so close to southern Oregon. And there's a lot of places in Grims Paths. And there's a lot of places in Medford and Ashland.
[01:32:16.080 --> 01:32:17.080]  Excellent.
[01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:24.080]  I mean, I have friends that are, you know, there's just so many breeders in the area. And now with the dispensaries offering more things.
[01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:25.080]  All right.
[01:32:25.080 --> 01:32:28.080]  And same with clones and different things. Yeah, feel free to reach out.
[01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:30.080]  All the best, Alison. Thank you very much.
[01:32:31.080 --> 01:32:35.080]  I can send you to a couple places. I know we'll have what you need.
[01:32:35.080 --> 01:32:51.080]  And, you know, they might be a little bit more like naturalized too, because they've been put outside a couple of times and then brought back in. You know, they have a lot more of that natural resistance compared to some of these clone guys.
[01:32:52.080 --> 01:33:07.080]  There's guys like selling stuff in like Portland that has never seen the sun ever. And that's kind of a big deal. Like, I truthfully believe that every like genetic should at least have like, you know, at least a day of its life in the sun, at least just one day.
[01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:23.080]  I wish that was the truth, Matt. But, you know, I will say that just as far as like people consider, especially if you're sourcing clones and you're, you know, you are in a region where you are going to be growing outside and, you know, finding out.
[01:33:24.080 --> 01:33:41.080]  A lot of the time genetics that are meant for indoor production and when you're purchasing, you know, the more knowledge you can get and people are getting better about this all the time with, you know, like knowing like this does better with indoor production versus outdoor production.
[01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:53.080]  And if you are doing outdoor production or greenhouse, there is a lot of thought that should be put to things that come from your bio region and have been grown in your bio region and do well in that region.
[01:33:54.080 --> 01:34:21.080]  We just had that little discussion about somebody asking a question about stuff for the coast versus somebody asking a question about something kind of more in like a mountainous inland area. And so, you know, if you are going to try and source something for your area, considering if it's spent its whole life indoor and then you're going to, you know, the genetic you're purchasing is something that is been cultivated for indoor production, it's going to perform differently outside.
[01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:39.080]  So that's kind of maybe something not talked about enough, but things acclimatized to bio region genetics do. So cannabis cultivar that's been grown in southern Oregon will probably do better for Brian than something that was grown, you know, on the coast in Vancouver.
[01:34:41.080 --> 01:34:45.080]  So that's kind of like my general feeling on those things.
[01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:56.080]  All right, Gravy, I just turned off the hands raised sign. You have the last question of the evening. You always like to drop in for the last bomb question. So what's up, brother?
[01:34:57.080 --> 01:35:16.080]  Sorry about that. Oh, no. My question. I just came up with it. So I was eating dinner and I love the conversation. I was just wondering, the people that know the breeders, are they digging up their tap roots from outside, bringing them inside and trying to breed with them again, because that's what I've been trying to do.
[01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:42.080]  I had my plants outside for the summer. I planted them in the beginning of April. And then they finally popped up. We had some frost and shit like that. And then I dug it up November, and then let it finish inside. And now it's reveged, and I'm going to flower and pollinate it.
[01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:51.080]  So I just was wondering if anybody else is trying to get two different types of batches with one particular cultivar or strength.
[01:35:51.080 --> 01:36:20.080]  I think that's badass that you did that. I joke sometimes that the true sign of a master grower is being able to like, right, revege plants, especially when you're digging them up and bringing them back in with that dedication. So I just want to honor you for doing that. I think that's really, that's really cool. And, you know, I would personally feel like the yield may not if you're doing it for flower, I would say I don't know if you're going to get like quite the yield you're looking for on something like that.
[01:36:21.080 --> 01:36:44.080]  But if you're doing it for breeding, I think that's awesome. And I think that's just a fantastic way to go when you find something like that. And if you can also, you know, if you want to clone those, what I would do is clone those things before I moved on, and then work with the clonal kind of brain not working.
[01:36:45.080 --> 01:37:02.080]  I would work with the clones, I would revege it, then I would clone it. And then I would work with the clones, because then you're going to end up with more, you know, or you could just work with the breeding on what you have there. But that would be how I would do it personally is making sure that I'm also saving that genetic if I went to all the trouble to revege it.
[01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:22.080]  If I can say as well, like what I think that's bad, but one piece of know is when you go in and out with plants, you usually create some ideal opportunities for certain predatory insects and molds to arise very, very quickly.
[01:37:23.080 --> 01:37:41.080]  So do be cautioned with that and make sure you're doing your due diligence, either have a halfway process if you have a grow inside that you're bringing them into that you can ensure that there might not be something there or have some defenses set up in your system already that would mitigate these problems to begin with.
[01:37:42.080 --> 01:38:01.080]  Yeah, that's the conversation we had with epigenetics the other day. Well, yesterday, but I let the pest persist. So if you looked at my Instagram, you would see things that make you kind of go what the fuck are you doing, bro? Because I've got some pretty heavy two spotted spider mite pressure.
[01:38:02.080 --> 01:38:17.080]  I wanted to see which cultivars well, which cuts would actually do well or tap roots would actually do well indoors. So I have a fit pressure and two spotted spider mites and thrips and some other things.
[01:38:17.080 --> 01:38:45.080]  But yeah, I dug up the tap roots, and only a few survived the revegging. And now it has the two spotted spider mites. And the only IPM I'm really doing is diatomaceous earth or taking them into the shower. I just wanted to get an epigenetic response. So yeah, I'm kind of like doing it on purpose just to see what will survive in the wind tunnel of shame, as I call it.
[01:38:47.080 --> 01:38:52.080]  I just was wondering if anybody else was doing it. Thank you very much for the answer. Thanks for your time tonight, guys.
[01:38:53.080 --> 01:39:16.080]  That's cool, Gregory. I just want to say that's cool. But you know, I just, I don't know. I mean, I personally, if it's something that you care about, and you went to all that trouble, I would just say, you know, maybe treating. We brought up a couple of things earlier. Like, I know that we had a conversation about cephaloil X earlier. And it's an easy, low key treatment that just works wonders.
[01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:33.080]  So if you have spider mites, just hit it every three days with cephaloil X and you will see, they will go away. And aphids, we had a whole discussion about also, but there's there's some, you know, I don't know, I would say that the taproot too is like, I'd be curious.
[01:39:33.080 --> 01:40:00.080]  I mean, that's kind of a deeper conversation. And maybe we don't have time for it. But just like the, like your goal with the taproot would kind of be my other question, like, why exactly that's mattering to you or, or what you're looking for with that, because it, you know, it only really sustains for so long, especially if it's something that has, you know, that you've brought back in and is revenging. So it's just interesting, like, what's the goal with the taproot?
[01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:15.080]  Personal preference, because basically nine out of 10 people that I talked to are saying cut clones. So I'm usually the guy that spits into the wind to see which cheek it lands on.
[01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:25.080]  Okay, gotcha. Because it really, you know, it matters sometimes. And I do, I mean, I obviously I love seed plants, but I will say that, like,
[01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:47.080]  you know, it doesn't always. I mean, that's how we hunt things, right? We hunt generally from seed plants, and then we cut clones. And if you want the genetics to, you know, persevere and hold on to them, so you can work with them or do other things with them. So it's kind of like a, it's a both and equation in my mind that you can you can have both.
[01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:57.080]  But if there's no other goal besides just the fact that you like it, you know, it's like, maybe there's a little bit more to like, ponder there.
[01:41:00.080 --> 01:41:09.080]  I would, I'm gonna say gravy, like, no, I don't mean that. I mean, with the utmost respect, I love having you on stage, but I am never getting clones from you, my friend.
[01:41:11.080 --> 01:41:13.080]  I'm just, I'm never gonna ask for clones.
[01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:26.080]  I, but I appreciate what you're doing at the same time. I didn't mean that in any insult. I think it's kind of interesting that you're just kind of going for it. I like to, I like to break the rules too. I might not be in the wind, but I'm definitely gonna break a few rules in my life.
[01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:35.080]  Yeah, well, I said spit. I don't want piss on my face, but, but I, I, I'm having my buddy take over.
[01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:38.080]  I'm having my buddy take over.
[01:41:39.080 --> 01:41:57.080]  Because I'm, I'm gonna rent out my house and the grow goes along with it. So we're going to cut clones from all the tap roots, get rid of the pest pressure, dip all the clones and move forward with rooting clones and the tap roots were just something that I did over the last three years or so.
[01:41:57.080 --> 01:42:18.080]  It was just a personal preference. But we're going to move forward with a different program in general, and it's definitely going to have IPM involved. I just wanted to do as much as I could over the last three years and just kind of the painstaking effort of seeing what dies and what lives and breed with that.
[01:42:19.080 --> 01:42:37.080]  And now that I've been able to do that and see that I can re-veg stuff from outside, I've kind of gotten it out of my system and I'm going to do it as if it was when I work in a commercial facility and just make sure everything's clean and, and quick and time is money kind of attitude.
[01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:44.080]  It's also about the journey, brother. So I do appreciate that. I didn't mean to like chew on it.
[01:42:45.080 --> 01:42:47.080]  But Evie, did you want to say something there? And then we'll close out the...
[01:42:49.080 --> 01:43:06.080]  I just wanted to say that there's a lot of different things that when you do dip, make sure that you're generally when you do your dips, you don't use full strength. So I'd be curious, you know, when you do get to that point, you can't, cephalolex is another one of those products you can use. I don't remember the exact formula off the top of my head.
[01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:18.080]  I believe it's like a quarter strength for when you're dipping clones, specifically for spider mites. But sometimes there's something you can use that will work for both aphids and if you have multiple pest crushers.
[01:43:19.080 --> 01:43:27.080]  But dipping, if you have to, I mean, obviously, clean mothers, taking cuts from clean mothers is best practice, but that's not always the way it works.
[01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:46.080]  So just dipping clones is a common practice. They don't always love it, but it is beneficial just to make sure that your propagation comes off clean and that you're actually saving what you want and not keeping the problem going. So it's a good tactic, but just be cautious when you do dip.
[01:43:47.080 --> 01:44:06.080]  Yeah, worst case scenario, we just start from seeds again. It's not a big deal. I think I've gotten it out of my system and when I hand it over to somebody else, if he just wants to cut everything down and then we'll start from fresh, it's quite all right with me. It was a fun journey. It was a good three years, a solid three years. So I don't mind starting from seed again.
[01:44:07.080 --> 01:44:26.080]  It's almost exciting to start a new project like that. And with that, we look forward to hearing about them on the regular, because I want updates on the regular. I love having you come up on stage and ask questions. You always bring a good zinger here, here or there, and I appreciate it. So don't stop doing that and keep it coming.
[01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:45.080]  I'm just going to say thank you to all the people out in Future Canada's project that came along for the show today, everybody else in the audience, all the panel members, all the panel, Cheddar, Bob, Anna had to go a little bit early. They were doing something. Evian, Matt, Johnny, we had Jason in here earlier. Who else? I'm missing one more, aren't I?
[01:44:46.080 --> 01:44:53.080]  Man, I thought it was Thursday. I came on Clubhouse, they were going to Jason's room and then I was like, oh my God, wait, it's Wednesday.
[01:44:54.080 --> 01:45:16.080]  Go check that out. Jason does an awesome show on Thursday nights. It'll be tomorrow at 7 o'clock. So thanks again, all the viewers. And be back next week to join us for another episode of Ask the Cannabis Nerds, Cancer Order Call to 101, where we diagnose your plants or talk about something challenging. Thank you all. I appreciate you and have a wonderful day.
[01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:23.080]  I'm going to leave the room open on the Clubhouse side, so you make sure to follow everybody that is here so that you make friends. Friends are good.
[01:45:25.080 --> 01:45:26.080]  Have a good night, everyone.
[01:45:27.080 --> 01:47:42.900]  What do you mean? How long do you guys let me go? How long? Every time I go so long and you just let me talk. You can't hear anything. I'm just talking away. But anyways, I'm going to give you a quick run through because I just said everything so smoothly and so nicely. Now I got to say it again.
[01:47:43.900 --> 01:47:47.900]  So we'll run through. We have Happening Very, Very Shortly.
[01:47:48.900 --> 01:47:50.900]  Christ sakes.
[01:47:53.900 --> 01:48:12.900]  We have Happening Shortly at 7 o'clock. We have Seed Collectors Volume 4. I don't know if it's Volume 4. Seed Collectors Happening at 7 with Chad. We then have tomorrow morning at 10 a.m. We have Brian and Layton showing up for an amazing conversation as it happens every Thursday in the morning.
[01:48:12.900 --> 01:48:26.900]  Then at 1 p.m. we have an awesome time where we're going to get some of, we have one of Bob Snodgrass' disciples and a couple other glass artists and we're going to be a new episode which we'll call Gathering Glass on Channel 2.
[01:48:27.900 --> 01:48:37.900]  It'll be a lot of fun. So don't miss out on that. There'll be fire involved. So if you want to come, maybe, there might be fire. I'm not going to make any promises, but I'm pretty sure there's fire involved in this show.
[01:48:37.900 --> 01:48:45.900]  So if you want to see some stuff on fire possibly and have a lot of fun with some amazing people, come over at 1 o'clock tomorrow on FPC 02.
[01:48:46.900 --> 01:49:05.900]  And then later on that evening we have Joda Herb. Joda Herb has this awesome show where he's going to be chatting with the organic, ah shit, Christ sakes, where he will be talking with, to talk with the organic cultivators about the Supernatural Conference, which will be very exciting.
[01:49:05.900 --> 01:49:15.900]  My hair is giant, bushy and big. Thank you all for hanging out and enjoying the conversation and taking part in today's show. We'll be back every week like we are every week.
[01:49:16.900 --> 01:49:23.900]  So I'm going for the Bob Ross of cannabis. Does it work? You tell me. Let me know in the comments. I'd appreciate that.
[01:49:24.900 --> 01:49:34.900]  But anyways, don't go anywhere. Actually, go somewhere. Go to the washroom. Have a bite to eat. But come right back here for a great episode. What the ffff? Yell into the mic.
[01:49:35.900 --> 01:49:51.900]  And for another great episode of the Cannabis Project. Thank you and we appreciate you all. Have a wonderful day. Thank you thousand. Can I yell any louder? I don't know. I've got to work on that. I've got to work on that. Thank you. We're over. It's done.
