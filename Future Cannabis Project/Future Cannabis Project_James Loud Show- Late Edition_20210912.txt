[00:00.000 --> 00:02.560]  Oh, we're here we're in here now cool
[00:04.200 --> 00:06.720]  That's why we're talking now saying I just put my
[00:08.120 --> 00:10.880]  Edgar how many kids do you have? I have two children
[00:11.400 --> 00:15.760]  Yeah, no, I just so we just had a third one and my three-year-old
[00:15.760 --> 00:21.720]  I just put down for a nap, but it's like an hour-long process. So I was just watching
[00:22.320 --> 00:24.320]  us open
[00:24.560 --> 00:28.420]  Final and now I'm back to football and annoyingly in LA
[00:29.180 --> 00:31.380]  Patriots games are not broadcast. So
[00:33.140 --> 00:35.140]  Anyway, here we are
[00:35.620 --> 00:37.860]  it looks like that it's like
[00:39.100 --> 00:42.940]  It's like after a concert or something like the cleanup crews in
[00:46.660 --> 00:49.900]  No one and I was a slightly stupid last night absolutely epic show
[00:50.660 --> 00:52.660]  Yeah, I saw that I think was
[00:53.180 --> 00:55.180]  Was Nat Pennington there too?
[00:55.740 --> 00:57.740]  Matt Pennington, I don't who's that
[00:58.620 --> 01:00.620]  humbled seed company
[01:00.820 --> 01:02.820]  oh, yeah, I
[01:02.980 --> 01:07.260]  Feel like he posted something from down there. What was it down in like San Diego?
[01:07.260 --> 01:12.940]  He's dead in San Diego and I wouldn't be yeah, I don't know him personally. I'm friends through Julie's friends with them
[01:12.940 --> 01:16.180]  There's a lot of people it's slightly stupid. They working with them on some strains
[01:17.260 --> 01:21.940]  So well, well, let's talk about what's going on. Let's let's talk about the last
[01:22.460 --> 01:28.780]  First of all Edgar, are you liking a blur right now? No, I'm chilling man. I'm just you know, it's pretty clear
[01:28.780 --> 01:32.340]  We've been smoking today. I'm not like high or like
[01:34.380 --> 01:38.060]  Yesterday was kind of nuts though to be honest yesterday was like friggin crazy
[01:38.340 --> 01:40.140]  So I show up and I'm late
[01:40.140 --> 01:43.740]  I was supposed to be here at 11 and I set up it like to or after actually
[01:43.740 --> 01:49.180]  but uh, I pull up and I could before I could even get to the shop there was a line around the block and it
[01:49.180 --> 01:50.340]  was like
[01:50.340 --> 01:55.220]  Probably 150 people deeper 100 people deep, you know, and this is free seed day
[01:55.220 --> 02:02.980]  This is with tents right and like you had like camped out people were camped out since Wednesday for an event on Saturday
[02:04.980 --> 02:11.620]  Received and I mean there was a bunch of breeders that donated seeds and to be fair the the first person that was there from
[02:11.620 --> 02:13.620]  Wednesday he bought stuff
[02:13.620 --> 02:17.580]  He's bought stuff before and he even came and brought me some action figures
[02:17.580 --> 02:23.620]  So keep people have a concept that they're like, you know scavengers know like these dudes are just huge supporters
[02:24.340 --> 02:25.860]  yeah, you know I
[02:25.860 --> 02:30.540]  Not knowing what to expect right because obviously this is the first one that anybody's done for seeds
[02:30.540 --> 02:32.540]  I mean, it's been done with comics for years
[02:32.940 --> 02:35.700]  But I didn't know what to expect exactly
[02:35.700 --> 02:38.900]  So, you know, I see this line and I was thinking it's gonna go either one direction
[02:38.900 --> 02:43.860]  we're gonna have like the thuggish ruggish element where people just want to get their free seeds and get the fuck out and
[02:44.100 --> 02:48.460]  Then it could go the other way where there's like, you know younger versions of ourselves
[02:48.460 --> 02:51.020]  Which I kind of feel like we saw a lot of those
[02:52.260 --> 02:54.260]  Those are the kind of people I want to give seeds to
[02:54.900 --> 02:59.340]  You know, I can totally relate to thinking cannabis is the best thing in the world
[02:59.340 --> 03:05.740]  I still do but you know when you're young it's such a new thing and it's such an amazing thing and to be able to
[03:05.740 --> 03:06.860]  grow
[03:06.860 --> 03:11.380]  Cannabis is just such a beautiful thing and you do it legally and you give seeds of free, you know
[03:11.380 --> 03:14.460]  I think that that's pretty amazing that you have all these people willing to donate
[03:14.460 --> 03:17.460]  And I feel like next year is probably gonna be even bigger and better
[03:17.580 --> 03:24.140]  Yeah next year probably be like a national thing, you know, people will take it amongst themselves to make an event
[03:24.700 --> 03:28.540]  Like pre seed day in their own town, you know, Colorado, Oregon
[03:29.180 --> 03:31.420]  Norcal's, you know, California is really big
[03:32.140 --> 03:37.020]  Michigan, you know the list goes on right for people getting free seeds
[03:37.020 --> 03:38.380]  Was it I
[03:38.380 --> 03:42.860]  Assume it was a mix of people who kind of knew like I'd love to have something
[03:43.220 --> 03:48.380]  Like this if you have it and other people who are just like I'll just take whatever you want to give me
[03:48.380 --> 03:54.080]  I kind of made the point that if you're here and you're expecting a specific company or a specific
[03:54.340 --> 03:58.780]  Strain a specific breeder. You're at the wrong place. Yeah, you're here to get free seeds
[03:58.780 --> 04:00.140]  But you know
[04:00.140 --> 04:06.100]  Their expectations were actually over exceeded when they open their bag and they find a name-brand seed company in there
[04:06.500 --> 04:09.340]  amongst ten other strains James loud included
[04:09.940 --> 04:13.820]  Good stuff. Yeah, I mean I gave away a bunch of seeds
[04:13.820 --> 04:18.360]  I was super happy and but it's like the people were just so grateful and you know
[04:18.360 --> 04:20.660]  And then when I left the line had gotten shorter
[04:20.660 --> 04:24.980]  And so I went through with like a big bag of weed and handed buds to everybody
[04:25.780 --> 04:27.780]  California we can legally do that
[04:27.860 --> 04:34.500]  It's great. Yeah, it's it's just great seeing these these people that want to support the industry support
[04:35.420 --> 04:37.340]  Cultivation I think
[04:37.340 --> 04:43.980]  Home cultivation. I just it's not gonna go away. Hopefully it just gets better and better and people, you know, people can appreciate it
[04:45.100 --> 04:49.460]  You know because home cultivation is so different like home cannabis homegrown cannabis
[04:49.780 --> 04:55.980]  Has its place and I think it's just as important or more important than the commercial stuff. Obviously, there's no money
[04:55.980 --> 05:01.760]  I think it's more important. I think it's more important. Yeah, we don't want to lose that. It's like as a society
[05:01.760 --> 05:08.080]  We're slowly losing all these arts like butchers for instance like that stuff's going away. It's like same thing with home cultivation
[05:08.080 --> 05:08.920]  We don't want it to go away
[05:08.920 --> 05:09.840]  We need that
[05:09.840 --> 05:16.840]  We need those young minds and people growing and finding new things and people just really excited about growing and cultivating
[05:17.040 --> 05:20.200]  Actually as a random tangent as a chef
[05:20.200 --> 05:27.320]  can you talk about like I feel like the lost art of the butcher where like we now have kind of like
[05:27.360 --> 05:34.160]  The top five cuts of beef whereas you could have other cuts but it's even it goes even deeper than that
[05:34.160 --> 05:36.880]  So like if you look at how butchery was a hundred years ago
[05:36.880 --> 05:43.040]  You would get if you're a butcher you would get a whole cattle and that whole whole piece of meat
[05:43.360 --> 05:45.360]  You know the hind quarters
[05:45.560 --> 05:51.520]  The four quarters the basically the all the legs everything intact head and you would basically break that down
[05:51.760 --> 05:58.000]  Right and now if you're a butcher you get a hind quarter if you're lucky a lot of butchers get manufactured cuts
[05:58.000 --> 06:02.760]  So they just get the rib eyes in and they might get a loin where they cut it into actual steaks
[06:02.960 --> 06:06.760]  But they're not getting a whole cow. I mean, that's just it's very different
[06:06.760 --> 06:12.120]  And so like that's what I mean by it dying art, you know, and it goes across the board with so many different forms of art
[06:12.120 --> 06:13.400]  They're dying
[06:13.400 --> 06:17.920]  You know and not necessarily put what people consider art, but I consider butchery and art, you know, it's a trade
[06:18.800 --> 06:20.800]  cooking everything's being
[06:20.800 --> 06:25.640]  Commercialized and simplified, you know, and I think to a degree some of that stuff has to happen
[06:25.640 --> 06:29.240]  But it's really sad when you lose something so artisanal, you know
[06:29.240 --> 06:34.600]  It's like bread making and all these things and then you can you know, there's obviously people can fetch a higher price for something
[06:34.600 --> 06:39.740]  It's artisanal, but I would like to see it more across the board more artisanal cannabis, too
[06:40.240 --> 06:42.520]  you know, I think you know diversity and we
[06:43.040 --> 06:48.640]  So often focus on things like what's happening now with cannabis is like gelato, right?
[06:48.840 --> 06:55.160]  We all like gelato and everybody's breeding towards a lot of what we've forgotten about 50 other amazing flavors and
[06:55.920 --> 07:01.480]  You know everything comes and goes and you know, I obviously we have people that are conscious of it
[07:01.480 --> 07:03.360]  We have people in other countries working towards it
[07:03.360 --> 07:10.040]  But we need to try to not try to not bottleneck stuff. We need to try to move forward and be creative
[07:10.040 --> 07:10.680]  Yeah
[07:10.680 --> 07:15.840]  they're gonna go home and amongst all the people they're gonna go on their bags and they're gonna choose what they like and they're gonna
[07:15.840 --> 07:21.000]  Make another namesake of some sort I'd imagine who knows it'll happen like we're stuck with cookies
[07:21.000 --> 07:26.560]  But with this day that we had yesterday probably opened up the bottleneck a little bit and you know next year
[07:26.560 --> 07:29.720]  You know, we open up the gap for more possibilities besides
[07:30.400 --> 07:32.700]  You know the hype. Yeah
[07:34.120 --> 07:36.120]  Now James are you a
[07:36.320 --> 07:38.400]  I'm still sticking on the meat
[07:39.360 --> 07:45.020]  Are you if you had your choice of steak cut like I don't really like filet mignon
[07:45.260 --> 07:48.780]  Like I just think it's a kind of a boring cut. Like what what's your?
[07:50.700 --> 07:57.260]  Valentine's Day surf and turf sort of cut, you know, you put it with lobster. It's very tender. It has its own benefits
[07:57.260 --> 08:00.580]  I personally am like a a5 Wagyu
[08:01.580 --> 08:09.800]  From from Kobe Japan that Wagyu a5, New York. I like that. I like the Wagyu the skirt steaks
[08:09.800 --> 08:11.060]  I like
[08:11.060 --> 08:14.820]  Creative stuff too, you know, I mean and I do like a good ribeye or a prime rib
[08:14.820 --> 08:19.900]  I don't eat a lot of steak. But what I do I like, you know, I like some fat. I like some flavor
[08:19.900 --> 08:21.900]  I think marbling is good
[08:22.260 --> 08:25.580]  Even tri-tip if you do try to correctly try tips freaking amazing
[08:25.580 --> 08:28.660]  And the funny thing is we're in California, so we all know what tri-tip is
[08:28.660 --> 08:32.240]  But you go to a lot of places they still don't know what tri-tip is even Texas
[08:32.240 --> 08:37.300]  It's not one of the more popular cuts. Texas is a brisket state. Those guys rock brisket like nothing else
[08:38.100 --> 08:44.980]  They break brisket for breakfast lunch and dinner over there seriously, yeah, I mean people were raised on brisket diets
[08:45.780 --> 08:47.780]  So and it shows
[08:48.900 --> 08:50.900]  But yeah, Peter what's your favorite cut
[08:52.660 --> 09:00.100]  As far as specific cuts, I mean I I like I mean I like stuff with bone in I like marbling I like grizzle
[09:01.580 --> 09:03.580]  Yeah, I
[09:04.780 --> 09:06.780]  What's that you eat the gristle
[09:07.380 --> 09:12.020]  Yeah, I mean not if it's like a ton of grizzle I won't like eat at all
[09:12.020 --> 09:14.340]  But like I definitely eat some of it
[09:15.140 --> 09:18.300]  Yeah, I mean, I don't like getting meat sweats anymore when I was younger
[09:18.300 --> 09:24.060]  I would go out to eat we do Korean barbecue something like that where you get the meat sweats afterwards and like literally
[09:25.060 --> 09:29.660]  Yeah, it was it was rough. It was really bad. Yeah, I thought those were fun times now
[09:29.660 --> 09:35.620]  I'm like, I don't ever want to do that again. I've never had the meats Brazilian barbecue Korea Korean barbecue
[09:36.620 --> 09:39.380]  I've been but I've never like diagnosed
[09:42.140 --> 09:44.140]  And then you feel pregnant
[09:44.580 --> 09:50.540]  Well Edgar where you are in on Fairfax, you're close to K-town right? Have you hit some of those?
[09:53.380 --> 09:58.420]  Nina too. They got some spots like yellow cow out there. We go to their Diana like Korean barbecue
[09:58.420 --> 10:02.500]  yeah, we go to the the H market the Korean market and we buy all the
[10:02.540 --> 10:07.900]  The sides for the Korean barbecue and we buy the meats and we go home and we have two
[10:08.460 --> 10:14.500]  Korean barbecue burners and we'll put on the projector and watch a movie and cook Korean barbecue outside
[10:14.500 --> 10:17.660]  If you've never had meat sweats though, it's because you haven't eaten enough meat
[10:17.660 --> 10:21.860]  I need to eat more meat. You need to crush it to where you feel sick and then you just eat even more
[10:21.860 --> 10:28.140]  Oh, you don't drink anymore. So that's good. It's been over a year now, right? It's been a year and some days. Congratulations. That's crazy
[10:28.500 --> 10:34.300]  That's that's awesome. Yeah, I used to love drinking I still do but I can't do it anymore. Yeah, but the meat sweats
[10:34.300 --> 10:40.700]  It's usually the combination of alcohol and meat and for some reason your your brain doesn't get the signal that you're completely full and you just
[10:40.700 --> 10:44.120]  Keep eating. Oh, you look pregnant like literally
[10:45.180 --> 10:47.180]  Your stomach like it's that bad
[10:49.300 --> 10:51.300]  Call Carlos
[10:55.500 --> 10:57.500]  So so
[10:57.540 --> 11:04.780]  Trevor said that his kid opened up the the Masonic action figure. Do you have one lying around?
[11:07.500 --> 11:11.540]  And is there a James Loud action figure in the works
[11:17.540 --> 11:24.180]  Does it come with a chicken oh, yeah a chicken a plant and there's even a little joint on the side right here
[11:24.180 --> 11:26.180]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[11:26.180 --> 11:29.420]  There's a little joint. Yeah, it's pretty sick. Pretty neat
[11:29.940 --> 11:33.380]  So one thing with Masonic and myself
[11:33.940 --> 11:37.220]  One of the things we have in common is we're both huge comic fans. I
[11:37.900 --> 11:43.940]  Recently started collecting again, but growing up I had boxes and boxes and boxes of comic books
[11:44.700 --> 11:50.340]  And then my lawyer actually came to me and was showing me how much his comics are worth and like show me these amazing comics
[11:50.340 --> 11:53.340]  And my dad had him stashed away his house. He just dropped him off
[11:53.340 --> 11:58.660]  But like there's yeah, I used to try to collect Wolverine and I almost had every appearance of Wolverine by the 90s
[11:58.660 --> 12:02.380]  Yeah now and then after that it blew up, but I have like 600 comics at the house
[12:02.380 --> 12:08.260]  Nice, and I'm going through and I'm collecting comics again. I absolutely love comics. You are a reader though. Yeah, I read them
[12:08.260 --> 12:14.300]  I don't collect like any arcs or anything. I read whatever's current. Yeah every now and then I'll go and there's classics
[12:14.300 --> 12:18.260]  You know, there's infinite crisis. There's six-part comics. There's a lot of comics
[12:18.260 --> 12:26.700]  You know, there's infinite crisis. There's Civil War. There's you know, all the the Thanos whatever thing like there's there's the classics
[12:26.700 --> 12:32.840]  You know and I'll go by like an issue that's on the shelf from like the arc and I'll just start in my collection
[12:32.840 --> 12:38.660]  But I'm a reader. So like I'll go by whatever Batman issues out right now. I'm reading that whatever spider-man's out
[12:38.660 --> 12:42.860]  I'm reading it. I'm up to date every time they throw a new show on TV
[12:42.860 --> 12:48.140]  I'm like the hipster that's like already read it like why the last man is gonna air on Hulu in two days
[12:48.140 --> 12:52.500]  I already read that whole book sweet tooth just aired on Netflix read that like ten years ago
[12:52.700 --> 12:55.900]  So I'm an avid reader of comic books. I like to read
[12:57.500 --> 13:01.400]  In certain terms of like kind of the mom-and-pop like
[13:01.860 --> 13:08.420]  Shops that carry comic books like where where are you getting comic books now versus like 25 years ago?
[13:08.500 --> 13:12.820]  So so there's still some established comic book stores like comic Colt
[13:13.020 --> 13:18.980]  No comic bug is they have a store over here and I go to Manhattan Beach to get my books
[13:19.180 --> 13:22.140]  But you know prior to that it was Jeffries comics and they were
[13:28.660 --> 13:33.380]  Yeah explosion yeah, but it's a table it's safe nothing happened
[13:34.260 --> 13:40.780]  No one was injured in the back comic bug comics are still alive and thriving people to go. There's a line sometimes
[13:41.180 --> 13:46.740]  They sell out of some issues it's still alive and well, yeah, I got a flying colors comics
[13:46.740 --> 13:50.540]  I haven't been in a little bit, but that I grew up going to flying colors comics
[13:50.540 --> 13:55.700]  I had a box that every month they would fill a box with a whole bunch of comics. This was 25 years ago and
[13:56.380 --> 13:58.380]  I collected a lot of like cool
[13:58.660 --> 14:04.020]  X-men from 25 years ago that who would have thought new mutants number 98 would be worth like three thousand dollars
[14:04.020 --> 14:06.940]  I have it in a nine eight and it's like I paid cover price for some of that stuff
[14:07.740 --> 14:13.340]  And by that he means three dollars and 99 cents, yeah, no, I think it was only a dollar 99 dollar
[14:15.100 --> 14:19.860]  Yes, so when I'm over here reading comics like I'm not thinking of the valley
[14:19.860 --> 14:24.540]  But you know one day I might look back and my my books and they might be worth something
[14:24.620 --> 14:27.580]  Yeah, bag them up and you never know bag been tagged. Yeah
[14:32.020 --> 14:34.020]  You guys see this one I
[14:34.940 --> 14:41.220]  Job shadowed John Bogdan of a back in the 90s. He drew Superman for DC Comics
[14:41.820 --> 14:47.140]  Awesome. Yeah, I'm that's a little bit past my time, but I am aware of Superman's death. I did read it
[14:49.100 --> 14:54.060]  So I I think just with movies I got lost when it was like the
[14:54.500 --> 15:01.980]  47th version of like a spider-man movie where and it's just like what what are your thoughts on kind of like all the Marvel
[15:02.940 --> 15:04.260]  DC movies
[15:04.260 --> 15:06.700]  They the first ones cuz there was a bunch of shitty ones
[15:06.700 --> 15:08.500]  Even the Ang Lee Hulk was kind of shitty
[15:08.500 --> 15:14.180]  But the thing is is like you have to go through these learning experiences for them to get good and now the Marvel Universe is
[15:14.180 --> 15:18.740]  Crazy, it's like fucking mind-blowing where you're having the these complex stories
[15:18.740 --> 15:23.740]  There's Easter eggs and all these that are planted before the the show and it's the next the next movie
[15:23.740 --> 15:29.620]  It could be five years from now. They're planting Easter eggs to evolve this this universe and there's multi
[15:29.860 --> 15:31.540]  It's actually even the multiverse
[15:31.540 --> 15:36.380]  But are you talking about in the comic books themselves or in the movies or in both?
[15:36.580 --> 15:41.140]  TV show the comics like one spider-man art might be like a
[15:42.020 --> 15:47.780]  Parallel universe like it's not always the same uncle Ben. It's not always not just a very you know, it's the multiverse
[15:47.780 --> 15:53.820]  It's everything so when you watch a spider-man movie and you're like wait up like isn't that supposed to happen?
[15:53.820 --> 15:56.540]  Like no, it's it's it can change every time
[15:56.540 --> 16:02.700]  It doesn't have to abide by one the original ones some some superheroes die. Yeah, that's only in that universe
[16:02.700 --> 16:05.100]  so like in these the multiverse a
[16:05.220 --> 16:11.300]  Whole different storyline can be happening and and and I'm about the nerd out and like we're just really diving down the rabbit hole
[16:11.300 --> 16:15.880]  But currently in the X-Men arcs anybody can die and they come back in an egg
[16:15.880 --> 16:23.100]  So like this is where we are in the comic world like currently like if they brought back fucking Phoenix married, whatever her name
[16:23.900 --> 16:27.860]  Cyclops his wife like it is like anything is possible in
[16:28.380 --> 16:34.300]  Jean-grey anything is possible in the books. Yeah, but I'll tell you one thing comic books are different than seeds
[16:34.300 --> 16:35.700]  So we'll get back on track with the seeds
[16:35.700 --> 16:39.260]  I was talking to somebody that just collect seeds yesterday and actually we were at
[16:39.420 --> 16:45.460]  The slightly stupid show backstage with this guy tone and we were talking about seed collections. He has this massive seed collection
[16:45.460 --> 16:48.220]  I said, you know seeds are a lot like money
[16:48.220 --> 16:53.700]  it's value is in its use and not as possession and I think that's an important thing to learn because
[16:54.980 --> 16:58.460]  It doesn't matter if you have gold and you store it away and you never use it
[16:58.460 --> 17:00.260]  You might as well have a rock in that place
[17:00.260 --> 17:03.400]  and one of my friends a long time ago gave me that analogy that
[17:03.740 --> 17:08.860]  money's use is in its value not in its possession if you have those seeds and you just hoard them and you collect them and
[17:08.860 --> 17:12.740]  You don't pop them and they get old and they're no good anymore. That's really bad
[17:12.740 --> 17:17.700]  But even if you know you you wait ten years and you pop them that you know, it's not
[17:18.500 --> 17:22.740]  As good as using them right now and finding those phenos. There's no time better
[17:23.300 --> 17:26.740]  Than right now to use those seeds to germinate them
[17:26.740 --> 17:30.340]  I mean as long as you can grow them out, you don't necessarily have to keep them alive
[17:30.340 --> 17:34.740]  But I mean not just say you guys keep collecting for all you collectors, you know, right?
[17:38.060 --> 17:41.360]  But pop those seeds, I mean I think collecting seeds is great
[17:41.460 --> 17:47.260]  You don't know that'll pop do something but really the value of them is not having those seeds in the closet
[17:47.260 --> 17:51.260]  It's having that plant and having that smoke and living library is where it's really at
[17:52.900 --> 17:54.900]  Gold never gets old
[17:55.620 --> 17:59.700]  You know what it's it's funny because you can't compare gold to seeds what I'm just saying is that
[18:00.460 --> 18:05.300]  Gold and seeds like if you basically put your gold and you never spend it and you die
[18:05.820 --> 18:08.340]  You could have just had a rock the whole time, right?
[18:08.340 --> 18:10.620]  You could have just had a table on that level
[18:10.620 --> 18:12.380]  Of course, I didn't give it to your children
[18:12.780 --> 18:17.540]  Of course old gold is better than old seeds, but old seed is way worse, but yeah
[18:20.340 --> 18:23.740]  The whole point is is like put it to use yeah put it to you
[18:23.740 --> 18:28.120]  Yeah, go grab that gold and maybe open a taco cart or something. I don't you can make money with it
[18:28.120 --> 18:30.940]  You can I mean I don't waste it but you know, I
[18:32.700 --> 18:35.180]  Have a question for James I had two different strains
[18:36.180 --> 18:39.020]  That's one on five C's three hermed on me
[18:40.020 --> 18:46.060]  Is it something to stay away from I would say that it has those intersexual traits in the plant and
[18:46.900 --> 18:50.620]  You know, the funny thing is is every once in a while, you'll get a bag seed
[18:50.620 --> 18:55.820]  You might have a whole bunch that Herman then you have one that doesn't you know, and you could grow that but there's a chance
[18:55.820 --> 19:01.580]  That it's gonna have that intersexual trait for sure and any sort of stress what I would do is I'd stress test it
[19:01.780 --> 19:08.620]  You have those two if you really really like it you stress test it you try to get them to basically express intersexual traits
[19:09.020 --> 19:14.380]  I think that's a way way to do it where you can kind of protect yourself now if you're gonna breed it
[19:14.780 --> 19:18.740]  That's where you run into problems because a lot of stuff already has intersexual traits
[19:18.740 --> 19:23.420]  So if you have something that you know that has intersexual traits and you pair that with something else, you know
[19:23.420 --> 19:29.900]  These hermaphroditic intersexual traits you cross those two together more than likely you're gonna get stuff that expresses really poorly
[19:30.900 --> 19:32.900]  Really? Well, I guess depending on how you look at it
[19:34.700 --> 19:37.020]  Edgar what what breeding question?
[19:37.500 --> 19:42.980]  If you had James loud sitting right next to you what questions would you ask him about breeding? Oh
[19:43.700 --> 19:50.420]  Man, I'm like a master breeder. So I don't even know what I'd ask him. I'm thinking that's a really good question Peter
[19:53.300 --> 19:56.340]  You know, I know it all I'm just kidding damn
[19:57.180 --> 20:03.060]  You know, I'm like what's something you're struggling with right now or thinking about or right now, man
[20:03.420 --> 20:08.020]  He needs to be able to make more seats cuz he's selling so damn many of them I'm
[20:09.300 --> 20:11.300]  what just uh
[20:12.260 --> 20:15.800]  My thing is like a pedigree and just you know
[20:16.740 --> 20:18.460]  Good cuts having you know
[20:18.460 --> 20:23.860]  The source if James could help me with anything is getting actual shit for my breeding stock
[20:23.860 --> 20:27.120]  I mean I have actual shit, but you know, it's who you know
[20:27.300 --> 20:29.740]  Yeah, and I think a lot of it goes back to
[20:30.420 --> 20:36.300]  You can call something anything but what is it really are you getting in getting it from the source is usually the best way to
[20:36.300 --> 20:38.420]  Go or somebody who you know, that's trustworthy
[20:38.580 --> 20:43.780]  It's just cuz you bought some fucking sherbert cutoffs and do that Fairfax doesn't mean it's sherbert
[20:43.780 --> 20:45.780]  Yeah, and that's one thing with me
[20:45.780 --> 20:50.980]  I'm very open like if I have snips like if I got GMO root beer, it's from skunk tech
[20:50.980 --> 20:56.580]  You know if I got sour diesel it's from skunk tech if I if I got you know sunset sherb from milky
[20:56.580 --> 21:04.120]  That's who it's from you know, and and that's I'm very honest about and who's milky like nobody cares. It's just like saying John Doe
[21:04.740 --> 21:10.820]  But that's that's the case like it's who you know, and if anything he could help me with is his pedigree
[21:11.060 --> 21:16.520]  That's about it because I'm I'm already doing well my systems working, you know, I'm I'm growing plants
[21:16.520 --> 21:22.420]  I'm crossing them to to Wilson and that's kind of the the system and it's working trust, but verify
[21:23.500 --> 21:25.500]  That's what I believe girls left out
[21:26.820 --> 21:28.700]  You know, it's like it's really you know
[21:28.700 --> 21:32.740]  I mean a lot of breeders also want to protect their work so they tell you their crosses are different than they are
[21:34.420 --> 21:36.700]  You know and that's just been common practice forever
[21:38.540 --> 21:43.380]  So trust but verify grow your stuff out if you're breeding grow it out make sure you're selling good seeds
[21:43.380 --> 21:45.380]  I think those are important things. Yeah
[21:45.980 --> 21:48.820]  Transparency for transparency. You don't necessarily have to grow it out
[21:48.820 --> 21:50.340]  But be transparent if you're growing it out
[21:50.340 --> 21:56.660]  You're putting a picture of the female that you used but you never go down and test it tell them it's the
[21:56.980 --> 22:00.660]  Exactly. That's the this is the mom. This is the dad respect that more than
[22:01.460 --> 22:08.660]  Just lying to their face a menu with everything across the runs brand new line is that's that's not as commendable as like
[22:08.700 --> 22:12.300]  Hey, here's some untested gear, you know, just it is what it is
[22:12.300 --> 22:16.820]  You know, it is what it is and and not not to say you should go out and do that
[22:16.820 --> 22:22.580]  Like I'm I'm a 29 years old. I've only been making seeds breeding for four years like it. I
[22:23.260 --> 22:29.820]  Level up I grow so and you know people might say yo, he's releasing untested gear. Well, I'm working on that
[22:30.420 --> 22:37.980]  You know like I'm planning on making my my customer base more, you know respectable and you know
[22:38.300 --> 22:41.580]  Whatever the case I'm transparent and and I'm working on
[22:42.700 --> 22:44.700]  upping my craft and and
[22:45.220 --> 22:47.220]  Testing your shit
[22:47.420 --> 22:52.220]  Does up you up like a lot of fucking points, but you test a lot of stuff you breed with right?
[22:52.220 --> 22:56.660]  Yes, I I grow a lot of stuff. I test I grow so much seed stock like ridiculous
[22:56.660 --> 22:59.180]  I keep that seed stock my Wilson melt
[22:59.180 --> 23:04.820]  I built that right and I've been running that for like two years now and I crossed that and you know
[23:04.820 --> 23:09.520]  I'm looking at anything that intersexes dies as far as from seed stock any clone that I use
[23:09.520 --> 23:12.100]  I it's getting flowered out or I already flowered it out
[23:12.100 --> 23:18.140]  If your stuff expresses intersexual traits, you should probably get rid of it if it expresses hoplate and viroid we've now
[23:18.140 --> 23:19.980]  You know, I've done a whole bunch of shows on it
[23:19.980 --> 23:24.480]  But and it can be passed through we were on the fence of if you can get it through seed or not
[23:24.740 --> 23:30.660]  Purple City genetics according to Joe Ramadi. I haven't verified this through them, but that was through him
[23:30.660 --> 23:34.020]  He said that it can be passed at the rate of around 10% through seeds
[23:34.020 --> 23:38.860]  So if you have hoplate and viroid which your plant starts to dead out if it looks funny and veg
[23:39.140 --> 23:43.100]  Get rid of it. These are especially if you're breeding, you know, if you're growing do whatever you want
[23:43.100 --> 23:45.740]  But honestly if you're breeding those are those are things that are gonna
[23:46.420 --> 23:50.420]  Improve your lines. Yeah, you know sexual stability is important
[23:50.420 --> 23:56.460]  So over time those things matter, especially a lot of us, you know, we breed stuff together within our within our wheelhouse
[23:56.460 --> 24:01.740]  we're constantly breeding stuff together and if you're using stuff that has intersexual traits a lot of your stuff is gonna express it and
[24:02.700 --> 24:08.700]  The thing is is sometimes if you're an indoor breeder you breed specifically for indoor and then those seeds get taken out
[24:08.700 --> 24:11.140]  And they're taken outside or into a greenhouse
[24:11.140 --> 24:15.860]  that's when you can run into real problems, but especially with intersexual traits if you've never stress tested your stuff and
[24:16.180 --> 24:19.500]  Somebody buys it and then they grow it outdoors. They're gonna think your seeds are garbage
[24:19.500 --> 24:25.900]  Yeah, I grow a lot of people's gear in my greenie without any kind of controls. Yeah, and
[24:27.060 --> 24:32.740]  Everybody shit herms in there and I'm very good about calling those and only rocking the good ones
[24:32.820 --> 24:35.260]  Well, it's a great way to stress test. Yeah, I think that's awesome
[24:35.460 --> 24:39.540]  So someone asked what's the difference between a breeder and a pollen chucker I
[24:40.540 --> 24:42.300]  think everybody
[24:42.300 --> 24:47.380]  Wants to think they're breeders but breeders are people that are breeding towards specific traits
[24:47.380 --> 24:52.020]  I called you know, you say pollen chucker seed producer. There's a lot of people are just producing seeds
[24:52.020 --> 24:55.020]  They're using other people's mails. They're not doing any work
[24:55.020 --> 24:59.780]  They're just basically putting either a male on or reversing a plant, but they're not breeding towards goals
[24:59.780 --> 25:02.660]  They're not breeding past that f1 and there's nothing wrong with that
[25:02.660 --> 25:07.860]  I mean, I think I think that that's great is if you're doing some work as far as making the seeds, that's great
[25:07.860 --> 25:11.860]  you know, it's especially if you're using it leaves a bad taste in my mouth when
[25:12.700 --> 25:15.860]  like you just have to someone should and that's your namesake or
[25:16.380 --> 25:22.980]  you just grab a male from a pack of seeds that you didn't make and that's your namesake like
[25:23.420 --> 25:28.280]  There's nothing you can do whatever you want. I know I preach that I say that but like
[25:28.640 --> 25:32.960]  You're not getting points in my book because you have to my Wilson or my
[25:33.320 --> 25:37.520]  Poonchang pie Wilson, whatever the case like that's a dope-ass train like the works already done
[25:38.040 --> 25:40.560]  you're just copying it almost so
[25:41.320 --> 25:45.200]  Whatever, you know to each their own and everybody's gonna do what they want to do
[25:45.200 --> 25:49.760]  Sure end of the day, but uh there people do care. I give a fuck, you know
[25:49.760 --> 25:53.000]  I'm and breeder. What's the difference between a breeder and a pollen chugger?
[25:53.520 --> 25:57.920]  I think is knowledge knowledge pollen chuggers are usually
[25:58.280 --> 26:00.280]  they see money signs I like to think and
[26:01.560 --> 26:03.640]  They can be hobbyists too. Don't get me wrong
[26:04.280 --> 26:07.840]  But the breeder they're like more scientific method behind it
[26:07.840 --> 26:13.840]  You know that they might break out a chart and do some, you know, find the recessive trades, you know
[26:14.320 --> 26:16.680]  markers on what every leaf is in
[26:17.520 --> 26:22.920]  Like data points you collect as much as you can on turf profiles and noses and stuff like that
[26:22.920 --> 26:24.960]  But you can be a pollen chugger and still do that stuff, too
[26:25.080 --> 26:32.120]  But you know, it's like you're actually so breeders actually are Fino hunters, I think that's the biggest part to you Fino and genotype
[26:33.600 --> 26:38.640]  You know hunting goes on and you basically have to go through and get your nose on stuff
[26:38.640 --> 26:41.600]  You have to get dirty and then you use those things for future products
[26:41.600 --> 26:47.040]  And when you say, you know, you mean like and you know, you're not sure you're growing it in Arizona. You're growing it every no
[26:47.040 --> 26:50.600]  That's more like geo climatized. All right, that's good, too. That's what I'm working on
[26:51.360 --> 26:58.720]  Works different but G so basically genotype would be like the structure or the way the leaf sets are things that aren't gonna change
[26:59.240 --> 27:01.240]  so with phenotypical expression
[27:01.680 --> 27:08.400]  Phenotypical expression can be affected by nutrition and environment. Okay, so I could take the same cut as you
[27:08.760 --> 27:13.640]  Right. Yeah, and we could grow it at my house and we could grow it at your house. It's gonna express two different ways
[27:13.640 --> 27:19.000]  You're gonna get different phenotypical expression. Whereas the genotype could be exactly the same. So
[27:19.600 --> 27:22.140]  The basically the way they're like a freak show
[27:23.080 --> 27:28.760]  Freak show that's the genotype of that plant. Yeah that you see a visual expression
[27:28.760 --> 27:33.520]  It's easy to spot that. Yeah, but it could smell different and that would be the phenotype for sure
[27:33.680 --> 27:35.680]  For sure. That's that I was kind of
[27:36.280 --> 27:42.120]  Dabbling in that up. Like I said, I'm just a little old me. We figure out everything as we go totally and these are things
[27:42.920 --> 27:44.920]  You know
[27:44.920 --> 27:47.240]  Wait, actually before you read another one off
[27:47.240 --> 27:54.240]  I had one saved up because this is what I've been thinking about and do I see a Joe citing Joe get on camera
[27:54.800 --> 27:59.160]  There he is. Do you guys know you have an amazing hash maker right behind you?
[27:59.560 --> 28:03.560]  He was asking it. He's like is that Peter and it clearly says quiet on the set
[28:06.080 --> 28:12.360]  I'd not I told him to photobomb the or whatever you call this I video bomb the
[28:15.240 --> 28:19.400]  Here and he always kicks it with me on the weekends. Yeah for everyone watching that dude
[28:20.120 --> 28:23.400]  He can make some some good hash. Yeah, we got
[28:25.840 --> 28:27.320]  So
[28:27.320 --> 28:29.320]  there was a
[28:30.600 --> 28:35.440]  Yeah, sorry, so basically crossing autos with other stuff to kind of
[28:36.360 --> 28:41.560]  Make it sort of a fast finisher. So a trend you're seeing my partner Andrew
[28:41.560 --> 28:46.160]  We were working on some really strong sativa stuff. He is a he's breeding the
[28:47.280 --> 28:50.360]  Well, I'm not gonna say what he's breeding specifically as far as cultivar
[28:50.360 --> 28:55.600]  But he's taking a longer finishing sativa breeding it with some of my auto stuff that I've been working on
[28:55.680 --> 28:59.680]  So my stable lines and it's funny because that first generation right?
[28:59.680 --> 29:03.920]  So like your f1 from an auto they none of them express auto flower
[29:03.920 --> 29:06.760]  They but what it does is it shortens that flower time, right?
[29:06.760 --> 29:11.600]  So they trigger faster and they finish faster. And so then what you have to do is you have to take
[29:12.320 --> 29:15.800]  Something within that progeny and either put auto flower pollen on it again
[29:15.800 --> 29:20.920]  Or you have to cross it with several of the males because you need it from both parents
[29:20.920 --> 29:24.320]  So you have to have donor receiver both have to have that
[29:24.800 --> 29:31.320]  recessive trait for it to express auto flower and then from there on you start using 24 hours of light to do your selections because
[29:31.720 --> 29:35.480]  Whatever it is an auto flower you get rid of it. So I crossed a
[29:36.480 --> 29:40.520]  Photo to an auto I did some dazma Festo Sam squanch nice
[29:40.520 --> 29:47.600]  I did a creme de la creme and I did strawberry nugget and I crossed him to Wilson and the progeny did end up
[29:48.120 --> 29:53.720]  Finishing short up shorter. Yeah, and no auto traits. What's right? Did it capture the nose of it pretty well?
[29:53.720 --> 29:56.160]  It's good really good weed. It's awesome. Yeah
[29:56.800 --> 30:02.600]  Yeah, auto flowers are just getting so much better big ups to Mephisto. Daz, you know, he started with Mephisto
[30:02.600 --> 30:06.120]  He's doing his own thing with night owl now, but I'm a fist oh man those guys
[30:06.120 --> 30:12.760]  We wouldn't be here where we are with auto flowers without Mephisto, you know, Tim and Mitch and those guys they're just crush
[30:14.040 --> 30:16.040]  You know and I got a lot of respect for them
[30:16.160 --> 30:22.280]  You know, it's like we so before Mephisto the auto flowers were freaking. Hey, they smelled like hey
[30:22.620 --> 30:28.280]  They were missing chirps and they were dry. I mean some of them were okay, but they weren't what they are now
[30:28.280 --> 30:31.280]  We're talking about three foot plants. Some of them yield up to four ounces
[30:32.080 --> 30:38.000]  That are turpy that have very unique turpins that wash now my buddy captain planet
[30:38.000 --> 30:44.680]  He's breeding autos for hash out in Colorado and he's getting some good numbers back from these autos
[30:45.320 --> 30:49.760]  Yeah, pretty gnarly. I mean we've had stuff to test it. I had a 31% auto flower
[30:50.760 --> 30:56.040]  31% THC auto flower, which is the first of its kind that I know of I mean there may be someone else has done it
[30:56.040 --> 30:58.920]  But as far as I know 31% is the highest test
[30:59.920 --> 31:01.920]  Just
[31:01.920 --> 31:07.240]  Quickly staying on that same topic when you say keep it under 24 hours a light it like
[31:08.120 --> 31:13.520]  Not 18 like it has to be 24 or just to be no you have to like so in my opinion
[31:13.520 --> 31:18.080]  And this is my humble opinion because I feel like there's other opinions. Some people might say 20
[31:18.760 --> 31:19.520]  But you know
[31:19.520 --> 31:24.680]  I used to have a blue dream that I vegged out and I had to keep my veg lights on 24 hours because I
[31:24.800 --> 31:28.600]  Believe blue dream to be a fast finisher for what it is
[31:28.600 --> 31:31.360]  I mean it still takes you know, 10 weeks or whatever 10 plus
[31:31.680 --> 31:37.000]  But if you don't keep it under 24 hours of light, it'll start to flower like those clones will start to pop
[31:38.520 --> 31:42.120]  And so with auto flowers if you don't keep it under 24
[31:42.120 --> 31:46.760]  There's a chance you might be taking something that's a quick that did basically
[31:47.280 --> 31:51.280]  It'll flower under 20, but then you put it under 24 and it goes back into veg
[31:51.280 --> 31:54.720]  Yeah for breeding purposes I did it's 24 just to be absolutely sure
[31:55.560 --> 32:01.200]  Just to be absolutely sure and the thing is is like when I grow auto flowers when I when I'm growing them
[32:01.200 --> 32:05.760]  I grow them under 20 hours of light rather than 18. I feel like they can handle it
[32:06.920 --> 32:13.040]  You know, I love auto flowers. I think auto flowers are definitely a great solution and you know, even smoking auto flowers
[32:13.040 --> 32:15.040]  I love smoking this stuff. I did a gelato auto
[32:15.520 --> 32:17.520]  They came out dark purple
[32:17.720 --> 32:21.080]  I have a chem sweat that came out dark purple the colder it gets with those
[32:21.080 --> 32:22.400]  I think it's getting in the 40s
[32:22.400 --> 32:26.320]  So now these things are expressing super dark purple colors when I said in the past
[32:26.320 --> 32:30.680]  That's actually another thing that has happened with the switches. So we have the we've deployed duct tape
[32:30.880 --> 32:35.880]  And I got white patches but when I was working with duct tape I wound up being a little pink
[32:36.060 --> 32:39.540]  So when you hang a switch I would be expecting to see a little dodge
[32:39.540 --> 32:43.620]  with those. I think it's getting in the 40s. So now these things are expressing super dark purple
[32:43.620 --> 32:49.620]  colors. When I seen gelato autos, that's not like, all right, we're on the right track, you know,
[32:49.620 --> 32:56.020]  or, or, you know, whatever. I thought it was really freaking dope that autos are evolving this
[32:56.020 --> 33:01.700]  quick. Cause there's a huge stigma for autos even still today. And what people like James loud saying,
[33:01.700 --> 33:05.860]  like there's, you know, autos are dope. You know, they're pretty fucking dope. I think they're
[33:05.940 --> 33:10.500]  really cool. I grew those dads, Sam's quiet strawberry nugget with like, I had grown some
[33:10.500 --> 33:14.740]  prior and it was like, the shit was stuck in time when it was growing, but these are a little bit
[33:14.740 --> 33:20.420]  more vigorous and the turps on it are pretty explosive. Yeah. It's only getting better. I mean,
[33:20.420 --> 33:25.620]  I'm trying to go in several directions cause I offer seeds to large scale cultivators. And so
[33:25.620 --> 33:29.540]  a lot of times they're just blasting everything. Yeah. They're processing it. So they're not
[33:29.540 --> 33:33.460]  selling any flour. What they're looking for is unique chirps. So I'm trying to offer as many
[33:33.460 --> 33:38.100]  unique chirps as possible. I heard a raw garden does that from what I've heard. They grow a lot
[33:38.100 --> 33:42.580]  of autos and they, they, they, they turn it into live resin or whatever the case be, but that's
[33:42.580 --> 33:47.300]  cool. And it's, it's more production. It's not the best solution for everything, but it is the best
[33:47.300 --> 33:53.060]  solution for some things. And auto flower, if you have a region that's monsoon, auto flower is great
[33:53.060 --> 33:56.820]  where you don't want to tarp if you, cause the second you put those tarps in a monsoon type
[33:56.820 --> 34:02.180]  environment, you're increasing the chances for mold, all types of mold, all kinds of Michigan,
[34:02.180 --> 34:07.460]  right. They had monsoon, monsoon season when I was over there recently, floods and shit.
[34:08.180 --> 34:11.700]  But yeah, so it's a great solution. You can do three runs per year sometimes. I mean,
[34:11.700 --> 34:17.060]  it's pretty amazing that you could do. So my stuff finishes 60 to 70 days, depending on the
[34:17.060 --> 34:21.620]  cultivator, depending on the environment, those things can be affected. Like if you have cold
[34:21.620 --> 34:24.820]  nighttime temps, you can expect to take it a hundred days. Sometimes it's good to fill the
[34:24.820 --> 34:30.100]  gaps with them too. If you got extra space, you could put autos anywhere. Yeah. So actually I'm
[34:30.100 --> 34:35.540]  looking at the comments. Jesse James said, nobody's really talks about flavonoids.
[34:37.460 --> 34:42.980]  We're actually going to do a, we're going to do a show on flavonoids. I kind of view them as
[34:43.860 --> 34:48.260]  like everybody talks about cannabinoids and terpenes and flavonoids are like the
[34:49.460 --> 34:52.900]  bastard brother or something. Overlooks flavor molecule.
[34:53.380 --> 35:01.060]  Somebody asked a while ago, do you have any Durban, any access to Durban poison?
[35:02.180 --> 35:10.180]  No. Okay. I do not. You know what? I got cookies. Cookies has Durban in it. So take that for what
[35:10.180 --> 35:13.540]  it is. But yeah, you know, you should go to Durban, go to Africa, go get some Durban seeds
[35:13.540 --> 35:19.380]  yourself. They still have them over there. I mean, I would say that the Durban poison over
[35:19.460 --> 35:25.060]  here is pretty much crossed with the super silver for the most part. We talked about that before on
[35:25.060 --> 35:30.340]  the show, but if you, you know, there's, there's several regions in Durban that have different,
[35:30.340 --> 35:39.540]  different varieties of Durban of the land race. But, and then someone asked right below that,
[35:39.540 --> 35:48.660]  cause you guys were just talking about, anything crossed with GMO is going to dump Wilson hybrids,
[35:48.660 --> 35:52.580]  Wilson hybrids. But the thing is, is like Frenchie can only, what he always said was
[35:52.580 --> 35:57.780]  every strain is a good hash chain. It just depends on what you like. So if we're talking about,
[35:57.780 --> 36:01.860]  you're talking about money, that's a different thing than like, than hash hashes should be
[36:01.860 --> 36:06.580]  whatever you like could be a good hash chain. Yeah. I mean, you know, obviously some stuff
[36:06.580 --> 36:11.540]  washes belts, you know, it's really fucking good, but you're only getting 2% out of it.
[36:11.540 --> 36:17.300]  Or, you know, GMO is everywhere, but you get in a lot more. So yeah, I mean, hashes is just,
[36:17.300 --> 36:22.020]  you're not going to get as much. You won't get a lot of yield on stuff. Yeah, for sure. I mean,
[36:22.020 --> 36:28.420]  I I love Skittles. I still love Skittles. Dude fucking Skittles hash Skittles extract is just
[36:28.420 --> 36:32.580]  nuts. And it's expensive because everybody only has a little bit. Well, nobody wants to grow
[36:32.580 --> 36:36.180]  Skittles cause it's the ugliest frigging plant. And it's super sensitive. It's like how, kind of
[36:36.180 --> 36:43.140]  how OG was in the back of the day where back in the day, nobody wanted to grow OG for basically,
[36:43.140 --> 36:46.420]  cause it didn't yield. And if like you could grow blue dream and get way bigger, there was this
[36:46.500 --> 36:52.340]  time when blue dream was out, people, they quit growing OGs and blue dream was getting top dollar
[36:52.340 --> 36:57.540]  for a minute. And then it just fell off and then you couldn't even sell blue dream, but OG, you
[36:57.540 --> 37:01.940]  know, it's a finicky plant. You can't feed it too much. You can't feed it too little super
[37:01.940 --> 37:07.540]  temperamental. It didn't yield anyway. I think people are getting better at growing as far as
[37:07.540 --> 37:12.980]  like with lighting and nutrition. So they're able to get stuff to yield better, but they just cross
[37:12.980 --> 37:17.620]  up Skittles. Somebody will make a nice Skittles hybrid where we can taste all the Skittles and
[37:17.620 --> 37:22.260]  get some bigger and some nice flower. If it's not, it's probably out there already. It just
[37:22.260 --> 37:28.740]  needs to be popularized more or put it in my hands. I hate Skittles. I love the variety of opinions.
[37:28.740 --> 37:33.540]  Totally. And it's okay. I mean, I like the candy of Skittles and I like the candy gas
[37:33.540 --> 37:38.100]  with a little bit of citrus. I feel like it just kind of checks the box, but you know,
[37:38.100 --> 37:44.900]  I mean, I also like sour diesel. I love fucking sour diesel and I love OG Kush and I love almost
[37:44.900 --> 37:49.460]  everything except for except for purple punch. I fucking hate purple. I don't dislike or hate
[37:49.460 --> 37:54.420]  these things. I just like some more than others. You know, like purple punch. I'd rather not have
[37:54.420 --> 37:59.700]  it, but I don't hate it. Oh, I think it breeds. Okay. It's really nice. They're breeders that
[37:59.700 --> 38:02.820]  don't even say they're breeding with purple punches. They're embarrassed to say that they're
[38:02.820 --> 38:06.500]  breeding with it, but they're fucking breeding with it because it creates good varieties. Yeah.
[38:06.500 --> 38:11.860]  That's a nice cross. It's one of the first good cuts that I grew, you know, put on a show. Yeah.
[38:11.860 --> 38:18.980]  RIP Eddie Lep. Saw that in the comments. You know, it's been a rough couple of years in cannabis for
[38:20.020 --> 38:25.060]  James. Just quickly. Can you, can you just give people kind of a, who Eddie was and why he was
[38:25.060 --> 38:30.980]  important? Oh, he was the biggest fucking fuck you to the government that there was for cannabis.
[38:31.220 --> 38:37.060]  He was like, come and get me. I'm going to fucking grow this. He was a type of person that didn't
[38:37.060 --> 38:42.020]  give a fuck about what the government did. And he stood up for people like us that are here today.
[38:42.020 --> 38:48.820]  We wouldn't be here without people like Eddie Lep. You know, it's great to have guys that try,
[38:48.820 --> 38:54.660]  you know, with cannabis, when we were going through medical, once we got to medical, he's
[38:54.660 --> 38:59.300]  the type of person that helped push it to where it is today without, without that. And without
[38:59.300 --> 39:03.140]  so, you know, he'd been cultivating for a long time. And I mean, part of, you know,
[39:03.140 --> 39:06.580]  I think the Skittles wouldn't be around. We had, you know, Shiloh and Brandon from third gen.
[39:07.380 --> 39:11.780]  That's all part of Eddie Lep. You know, they worked for Eddie and it's like,
[39:13.140 --> 39:19.060]  there's special people like Eddie Lep that without him, we wouldn't be where we are today. They helped
[39:19.060 --> 39:27.140]  push the industry forward. You know, it's sad to see these people go. I'm, you know, I'm newer
[39:27.140 --> 39:33.220]  to the scene and I see how other enter, you know, entertainment world, the music world,
[39:33.220 --> 39:37.380]  they give their roses to people that pass, but you know, they also give them to them while
[39:37.380 --> 39:42.740]  they're around in here. And like dudes die every day from the weed world. And they're like, oh,
[39:42.740 --> 39:46.580]  that's the inventor of Bubba or that's the inventor. And they just die. And we're like,
[39:46.580 --> 39:54.980]  really? Like Josie Wells, GG four guy just died. And everybody's like, Whoa, he did GG four. And
[39:54.980 --> 40:00.340]  I don't think we give enough roses and credit to the pioneers that might still be lying around
[40:00.340 --> 40:07.300]  people that are so impactful in an industry that's still in its infancy. You know, cause I mean,
[40:07.300 --> 40:12.180]  there were people in the seventies and eighties that didn't give a fuck. There are people, you
[40:12.180 --> 40:16.980]  know, we'll, we'll see, go for example, you know, he went to prison in the early nineties, part of
[40:16.980 --> 40:24.100]  that whole fucking crazy raid. And it's people like that, that if it wasn't for those people,
[40:24.100 --> 40:29.140]  it would still fucking be illegal. We would still be going to prison for cannabis. And,
[40:29.780 --> 40:36.100]  you know, we, there's, I can't think these people enough. Yeah. You know, I mean, I think I've been
[40:36.100 --> 40:40.100]  cultivated. If, if basically if you were cultivating when it was illegal, you were doing your part,
[40:40.660 --> 40:46.420]  but there's some people that took it another step and, you know, these people, you know, I mean,
[40:46.420 --> 40:50.660]  there's a bunch of them out there. Not to say they didn't get their roses, but there's gotta be like
[40:50.660 --> 40:55.140]  some rock hall of fame where we can just, while they're alive, be like, Hey, like, thank you. You
[40:55.140 --> 41:00.100]  know? And until wait till they're dead and be like, Oh, we'll buy all your seeds now. Yeah.
[41:00.100 --> 41:04.820]  You know, TGA sub cool diet. Like, well, whatever. Now we'll buy your penny wise seed,
[41:05.460 --> 41:11.460]  you know, things like that. Maybe somebody can like, I don't know. There has to be some type
[41:11.460 --> 41:15.780]  of literature or something where like we can put a finger on the people that are still alive.
[41:16.740 --> 41:20.820]  Well, it's like there's, there's activated activists and there's cultivators and there's
[41:20.820 --> 41:24.820]  people, you know, those, the activists that were in there that fucking stood on the front line and
[41:24.820 --> 41:30.580]  were like, fuck you come get me. This is wrong. What you guys are doing, you know, without that,
[41:30.580 --> 41:34.580]  I mean, it definitely still be illegal. And the fact that we're able to fucking
[41:35.460 --> 41:43.060]  walk around with jars of weed like this, leave it on. Yeah. That's an apples and bananas here.
[41:43.060 --> 41:48.580]  It's pretty fucking good. But, uh, I love that smell. That's a good one.
[41:49.540 --> 41:53.060]  Is that something you brought down? I did bring this down. Yeah. I mean,
[41:53.060 --> 41:58.020]  I fly with weed in California, especially I don't give a fuck and you shouldn't either. It's our
[41:58.020 --> 42:02.820]  God given right. And also it's legal in California, you know, our state, it's legal to have
[42:02.820 --> 42:07.540]  cannabis and it should be legal to fly with it. I also have a recommendation for a doctor. So it's
[42:07.540 --> 42:13.140]  also, you know, legal on that medical note, but regardless it's, it's our God, God given right to
[42:13.140 --> 42:17.460]  be able to have marijuana. I think that anybody that disagrees with that, there's something wrong
[42:17.460 --> 42:23.940]  with it. Yeah. They're just misinformed for sure. Yeah. I mean, I think a lot of it, the reason it's
[42:23.940 --> 42:28.900]  illegal, there's a lot of bullshit behind that too. And it has a lot to do with money. Yep.
[42:28.900 --> 42:32.740]  As everything. And a lot of the fucked up things in this world, you know, they have a lot to do
[42:32.740 --> 42:39.140]  with money, unfortunately. So yeah, everybody took a DMT trip tonight. You wouldn't have somebody
[42:39.140 --> 42:44.420]  flipping your burgers tomorrow at McDonald's. No, I went to Joe Rogan on, on a Friday night.
[42:44.420 --> 42:48.260]  I've been all over. I was in Seattle all last week, working, did site visits to places.
[42:49.300 --> 42:53.540]  Then I got home and literally two hours later, I left the limo to go see Joe Rogan with friends.
[42:53.540 --> 42:59.780]  And Joe Rogan was talking about how he'd be like in the studio. No, I went to Joe Rogan.
[43:00.580 --> 43:06.020]  He performed. Oh, he did. He did a comedy session. Yeah. Comedy with 30,000 people,
[43:06.020 --> 43:12.020]  super spreader event, talking about how he beat COVID and you know, how Prince Harry,
[43:12.020 --> 43:18.100]  it's so weird. Cause he has a Prince talking about how he's such a bad person for spreading
[43:18.100 --> 43:23.140]  misinformation about some horse warming, deworming drug. And it's like something that people are
[43:23.140 --> 43:27.060]  calling a horse. You know, I don't want to get into the details right now, but it's definitely
[43:27.140 --> 43:31.940]  not just a horse deworming drug. It's something that's prescribed to humans
[43:31.940 --> 43:36.980]  in small amounts. It's safe. It's the people that take a horse dose that have problems. But you know,
[43:36.980 --> 43:40.820]  this is a topic for another one, but he's making fun of Prince Harry telling him the Prince,
[43:40.820 --> 43:42.740]  telling everybody that Prince Harry needs to take mushrooms.
[43:42.740 --> 43:47.460]  Yeah. The Ivermectin, the milligram tablets. I used to sell those when I was working in the
[43:47.460 --> 43:51.300]  pharmacy. Like I seen those on TV. I'm like, those are, you're allowed to take those. We
[43:51.300 --> 43:55.780]  give those to people, but people were going to the fucking veterinarian and shit.
[43:56.420 --> 43:59.620]  Give me the fucking horse dewormer and going home and those.
[43:59.620 --> 44:00.820]  Give me that special K.
[44:01.540 --> 44:07.140]  Yeah. I mean, I think we need to look deeper at what the actual problem is, not just the symptoms.
[44:07.140 --> 44:12.100]  That's what a lot of times goes on as we look at something, individuals, I think people that
[44:12.100 --> 44:18.580]  had problems with Trump or with Obama or whatever, as a president, we need to look more at what the
[44:18.580 --> 44:22.980]  actual problem is, not just the symptoms of the problem. Because a lot of times, even with plants,
[44:22.980 --> 44:30.180]  what we see, the plant's turning yellow. Well, what's the actual real problem? Or if it has
[44:30.180 --> 44:34.980]  problems with bugs or is the plant health wrong? We need to look deeper into issues rather than
[44:34.980 --> 44:42.580]  looking on the surface. So yeah, totally off topic from cannabis.
[44:43.780 --> 44:45.220]  And totally contentious.
[44:45.940 --> 44:47.620]  Everything besides weed today.
[44:48.580 --> 44:55.380]  Yeah. I love that. I was going to keep pushing you guys and talk more about comics and-
[45:00.340 --> 45:06.500]  Yeah. Love comics. Can't go wrong. Yeah. It's been an interesting conversation today. We've
[45:06.500 --> 45:10.500]  had some good stuff. Impromptu. And then you just had a baby, Peter. So why don't you tell
[45:10.500 --> 45:12.420]  us about that experience? I mean, not physically, but-
[45:16.820 --> 45:24.100]  It was the third time I've been on the front lines of a baby popping out of a vagina and
[45:26.100 --> 45:32.500]  cutting the umbilical cord. Every time the doctor gives me the scissors to cut the umbilical cord,
[45:34.420 --> 45:40.420]  you can't be like, I don't want to do this. But it feels like you're cutting through rubbery
[45:41.380 --> 45:44.580]  squid. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, you've been there.
[45:44.580 --> 45:49.540]  Yeah. I did it. And I pass out when I see blood and he's like, you have to do it.
[45:49.540 --> 45:51.700]  Yeah. And then the placenta pops out and-
[45:54.420 --> 45:56.420]  Lots of fun. Yes.
[45:56.420 --> 46:00.420]  I got goosebumps now, Peter. Thank you. So are you guys all home together now?
[46:01.300 --> 46:11.060]  I- Yes. So my wife is currently napping upstairs. My three-year-old's napping upstairs. The newborn
[46:11.060 --> 46:15.780]  is napping upstairs. And Gemma's with her mom right now. What?
[46:15.780 --> 46:19.460]  You didn't by chance have a midwife come to the house and do a water birth or anything like that?
[46:19.460 --> 46:20.500]  No. No.
[46:22.340 --> 46:24.420]  It was an epidural.
[46:24.820 --> 46:32.260]  Yeah. My good buddy, Selma from Amsterdam, did the water birth with his son, Jake. Trippy.
[46:32.260 --> 46:34.740]  My buddy, Malinale, did a standing birth.
[46:35.460 --> 46:37.620]  Whoa. That's hardcore.
[46:37.620 --> 46:42.180]  That is hardcore. He dressed like an Aztec, so he's a hardcore motherfucker.
[46:42.180 --> 46:44.260]  Yeah. He gets in the regalia and shit.
[46:44.260 --> 46:47.380]  Trippy. He does rain dance with plants and shit.
[46:48.340 --> 46:55.780]  Let me slowly moving back in the comment- Well, first of all, have you hooked James up with a
[46:55.780 --> 46:58.980]  t-shirt? Because I see a lot of t-shirts. He did. He gave me a bust bump. I didn't wear it
[46:58.980 --> 47:03.060]  today. I wore my greenstone, you know. I'm wearing a Simpsons. We're good. Sunday,
[47:03.060 --> 47:09.380]  I did not. James, can you pull off the shelf behind you your favorite t-shirt?
[47:10.260 --> 47:14.340]  My favorite t-shirt? I like the MF dinner one.
[47:15.300 --> 47:18.660]  MF dinner. Yeah. It's some old school hip hop.
[47:20.020 --> 47:28.400]  I mean, you guys want to see a cool massage shirt? This is still my favorite design right here.
[47:30.320 --> 47:33.200]  That one. Solid. You want to talk about-
[47:33.840 --> 47:39.600]  Yeah. So this is a collaboration and effort with Hashishin Podcast. He likes to talk about Hash.
[47:39.600 --> 47:44.640]  He has Hash people on his show, and I happen to make strains that are good for Hash. So he put
[47:44.640 --> 47:50.480]  me on his show, and he's like, I got this dope idea. He sent me three mock-ups. This was my
[47:50.480 --> 47:56.720]  favorite one. It's kind of like a Jimi Hendrix-esque theme. And they put some things that might
[47:56.720 --> 48:02.160]  mark me. So there's like a Pikachu poster, MF doom, Wilson ball. These are seeds right here.
[48:02.160 --> 48:08.720]  Cats, roosters, all CNI. 90059 is where I'm from. I'm actually from Watts, California,
[48:08.720 --> 48:15.120]  and Masonic's on Fairfax. That's my store. Masonic. I'm not a Freemason. It's named after
[48:15.120 --> 48:20.080]  Mason jars. Long story short, we just kind of played on the Mason thing, and it turned into
[48:20.080 --> 48:25.920]  Pyramid Illuminati secret handshakes the whole night. Right. Yeah. It looks like it. So this
[48:25.920 --> 48:32.000]  reminds me of all the 70s concert posters. Grateful Dead, Jimi Hendrix, all that. The old
[48:32.000 --> 48:37.280]  school. Yeah. It's got a unique touch. And I mean, all his shirts have a unique vibe to them.
[48:38.240 --> 48:44.720]  I really like the fact that he gets creative with it. I think the world needs more creativity in it.
[48:45.440 --> 48:51.200]  And as far as people want to get, they get in this mindset that things have to look
[48:52.160 --> 48:56.400]  specifically like this or specifically like that. We need a lot more creativity in the world.
[48:56.400 --> 49:01.280]  So yeah, I don't even have one logo that identifies me to this day. They're like,
[49:01.280 --> 49:06.800]  what's your Coca-Cola symbol? What's your Nike sign? I don't have one yet.
[49:06.800 --> 49:15.200]  Yeah. I've always been like that of like the brand is like the fact that it's not really a brand.
[49:15.200 --> 49:19.440]  Yeah. It's like this. Does Grateful Dead have one like is the steal your face there?
[49:19.440 --> 49:23.600]  But then when they do this to your face, they put whatever on the inside. They switch up the scheme.
[49:23.600 --> 49:28.720]  Yeah. Whatever the case is, just, you know, I was born one day before Jerry. So
[49:28.720 --> 49:32.560]  I don't know. Maybe we got that same thing going on in the brain.
[49:32.560 --> 49:40.960]  Yeah. Same vibe. Yeah. Good old Jerry. Rest in peace. Yeah. I mean, it's funny because I listen
[49:40.960 --> 49:45.280]  to Grateful Dead more now than I probably ever did as a kid. I love Grateful Dead as a kid.
[49:45.280 --> 49:49.440]  Some of the stuff, but some of those, you know, there was songs I liked and songs I didn't like.
[49:49.440 --> 49:53.440]  Now I kind of appreciate everything. The nostalgia is probably part of it.
[49:55.920 --> 50:02.160]  You know, and it's like it's a lifestyle, too. I love the designs. I gravitate. I have a couple
[50:02.160 --> 50:07.360]  vinyls from them that people give me and I'll slap them on and they're kind of folksy, but I'll
[50:07.360 --> 50:13.920]  listen. No. Yeah. And Grateful Dead is just good driving music. Yeah. That's what I noticed as well.
[50:13.920 --> 50:18.880]  It is good driving music. Yeah. So if you're depressed, you listen to Grateful Dead. If
[50:18.880 --> 50:21.840]  you're happy, you listen to Grateful Dead. It's just one of those things that kind of fits in
[50:21.840 --> 50:27.200]  every scenario. But it's not for everybody. Shooting up people on a helicopter. Grateful
[50:27.200 --> 50:35.840]  Dead. Yeah. Right. Yeah, it's it's an acquired taste for sure. Yeah. I don't know about John
[50:35.840 --> 50:41.040]  Mayer and Dead and Co. Is that what he's talking about? Yeah. I mean, no comment. I think I did not
[50:41.040 --> 50:48.080]  like it when John Mayer was at first. I thought, man, this is shitty. That was Jerry's job. What
[50:48.080 --> 50:53.280]  the fuck is going on with John Mayer? But I have to give him respect. I think he's been respectful
[50:53.280 --> 50:58.800]  with the music and obviously Bobby wants to continue playing. And so how can you hate on it
[50:58.800 --> 51:01.600]  too much? I mean, it's you know, if you don't like it, you don't like it. You don't have to listen
[51:01.600 --> 51:05.520]  to it. But there's a lot of people that do love it and do listen to it. And I think John Mayer
[51:05.520 --> 51:11.520]  is definitely talented. You know, Bobby, for sure. He's probably the greatest rhythm guitar player of
[51:11.520 --> 51:19.760]  all time ever. I mean, to be in Jerry's shadows to a degree and be so talented, I think.
[51:20.080 --> 51:23.600]  It's just amazing. And the guy, the way he can play guitar and sing is just epic.
[51:25.920 --> 51:32.880]  You know, so. We're on Grateful Dead now. What else? Jerry, speaking of Dead and Company,
[51:32.880 --> 51:36.560]  I'm going to go my first Dead and Company show. If you guys are going to be there, it's October
[51:37.600 --> 51:42.320]  20. It's either 20th, 29th and 30th or this little Hollywood Bowl show. Yeah, I was going to say,
[51:42.320 --> 51:46.480]  I think it's down here, right? I will be there. So if you guys are there and I'll bring seeds to
[51:47.440 --> 51:52.240]  give out seeds to people. So if you guys are available and you guys should give them out at
[51:52.240 --> 51:56.560]  the show, I will give them out at the show. You know, the guys that sell drugs in the front.
[51:56.560 --> 52:01.120]  I'm not going to sell. You could start a whole new thing in the parking lot of
[52:02.000 --> 52:06.480]  and there is some wacky dude giving free seeds out. Forcing us to take seeds.
[52:07.840 --> 52:12.000]  We're like, we just want weed. And he was like, no, no, take these seeds. I'm teaching you how to
[52:12.800 --> 52:17.920]  get seeds. Now you don't have to find bag seeds from the Grateful Dead show. You actually have
[52:17.920 --> 52:25.440]  seeds. Yeah. Everybody has Grateful Dead bags. Oh, yeah. So I think David Guzman in the chat
[52:26.000 --> 52:32.320]  has been persistent with kind of what, how many seeds you need to pop to kind of call it a hunt?
[52:32.880 --> 52:42.080]  One, two, one. You know, I mean, in all honesty, like if you're talking about hunting phenos,
[52:42.080 --> 52:45.680]  it's just, it depends on the variety. Sometimes you can pop 10 seeds and get three things that
[52:45.680 --> 52:49.600]  are amazing. And other times you can pop a thousand seeds and you can be like, this is garbage.
[52:51.120 --> 52:55.920]  I found it amongst seed stock. Some seed stock sucks. Yeah. You know, some seed stock,
[52:55.920 --> 53:01.120]  it's easy to find stuff. You know, going through some compound gear lately and some other breeders,
[53:01.360 --> 53:05.520]  some exotic stuff, I feel like there's a lot of good stuff in there. Even in a 10 pack,
[53:05.520 --> 53:09.120]  I'm finding interesting stuff. Not necessarily that I would consider a keeper for breeding or
[53:09.120 --> 53:14.720]  for otherwise, but I think for the average person, they would be super stoked with any of those,
[53:14.720 --> 53:20.160]  you know, for the most part with any of them. And you got to keep in mind, keeper, that's your
[53:20.160 --> 53:25.680]  definition of a keeper. Right. So is it going to be the next Girl Scout cookies? Probably unlikely.
[53:25.680 --> 53:29.600]  I mean, going through, and a lot of those are lottery tickets, you know, but as far as,
[53:30.160 --> 53:34.000]  it's all about you. What are you going to use? You know, you're trying to find a lottery ticket
[53:34.000 --> 53:36.800]  that you can make money off. That's a different story. But if you're trying to find cannabis that
[53:36.800 --> 53:41.680]  you can grow, that you're going to enjoy, if it's a reputable breeder, that's doing good work,
[53:43.120 --> 53:48.080]  usually a 10 pack, you're going to find something like. My thing, a keeper is like the next,
[53:48.080 --> 53:52.080]  you know, namesake. So like Skittles, all these things there, you know, you know,
[53:52.080 --> 53:55.360]  when you smell it, you know it. So that's a keeper. Like when you pick it up,
[53:55.920 --> 53:59.840]  that's a keeper amongst everybody in the world, you know, like, but then there's like keeper.
[53:59.840 --> 54:04.560]  Yeah. I got keepers of tons of shit, but it's just a twist on, you know, great pie or a twist
[54:04.560 --> 54:09.840]  on papaya. Yeah. I mean, for me, for me, when I do pheno hunting, I like a hundred seeds because
[54:09.840 --> 54:14.800]  that gives me 1%. Right. So if I find that one in a hundred, cause what I'm doing is I'm looking for
[54:14.800 --> 54:19.680]  outliers. You know, obviously I'm looking for the best stuff, but I'm not just looking for the best
[54:19.680 --> 54:25.040]  stuff. I'm looking for different shit. So it's one thing finding something that's the very best of
[54:25.280 --> 54:28.720]  the hundred. It's another thing, finding something that's fucking different than everything else
[54:28.720 --> 54:32.000]  you've ever seen before. It doesn't necessarily have to be the best, but it smells like fucking
[54:32.000 --> 54:37.120]  garlic curry in armpit. You know, that might, it's not, it's not for everybody, but those things,
[54:37.120 --> 54:42.640]  if you know, there's like definitely a group of people that love that GMO love that. You know,
[54:42.640 --> 54:46.560]  a lot of times those things that are really pungent, funky, are really strong and heady.
[54:46.560 --> 54:51.200]  The outliers are going to show regardless in a, you know, in a two pop, even if you pop one,
[54:51.200 --> 54:55.840]  you can compare it to stuff you've done before, even if it's around that realm. So you'll be able
[54:55.840 --> 55:01.840]  to like, it's your keeper, you know? So, so someone says S1 something, because it's just the
[55:01.840 --> 55:08.080]  same. S1s are not the same. We're talking about a combination of genetics. Now, if it was a,
[55:08.640 --> 55:15.040]  basically a variety that was stabilized and it was fully stabilized, you know, we're talking
[55:15.040 --> 55:20.400]  about zygoste. So if it's a homozygous, which means that it only expresses one thing,
[55:21.360 --> 55:26.320]  then if you S1 that, you self it, it's going to be that. But for the most part, nobody's working
[55:26.320 --> 55:30.320]  with that. We're working with stuff that's like, you know, these complex polyhybrids and these
[55:30.320 --> 55:34.800]  complex polyhybrids have several different lineages in them and different percentages
[55:35.520 --> 55:39.840]  of things. And they express towards one or the other. So when you self it, you're going to get
[55:39.840 --> 55:44.160]  a lot of different expressions. And then as far as phenotypical expression, you probably won't
[55:44.160 --> 55:49.680]  get the exact same thing. You might find something close in there, but as far as, yeah, someone said
[55:49.680 --> 56:00.320]  like an IBL and that's what an IBL is. It's a stable line, inbred line. So anyway. So there,
[56:00.320 --> 56:05.840]  okay. So not necessarily what you think, well, actually in both directions, what, what will be
[56:05.920 --> 56:13.920]  the pop star of 2022 that you don't necessarily like the Katy Perry? And what are you most excited
[56:13.920 --> 56:20.320]  for in 2022? What's going to be the most hype-ish shit in 2022? And what are you hyped about in 2022?
[56:20.320 --> 56:29.120]  The line that I'm going to be releasing in 2022, we're doing some Zerios, cereal milk crosses
[56:30.160 --> 56:35.600]  that are going to be ridiculous. I think there's going to be some winners in that for sure.
[56:35.600 --> 56:39.360]  And we're selling seeds of it. So I think there's going to be a lot of opportunity to find that next
[56:39.360 --> 56:46.000]  winner, but I don't know, man, I'm thinking it's going back to gas. I'm hoping it goes back to OG.
[56:46.000 --> 56:50.560]  We're going to get OGs cracking again and not necessarily just plain OG. I want OG with a
[56:50.560 --> 56:55.600]  twist, OG that leans towards something else. I think we're all about complexity now. So it can't
[56:55.600 --> 57:00.400]  just hit on one level. If it's OG, it's got to be OG plus a little bit of this. I think,
[57:01.120 --> 57:04.000]  you know, more gas than dessert. That's what I'd like to see.
[57:05.840 --> 57:09.600]  I know on the Hill right now, they're growing tons of honey banana. So you'll see tons of
[57:09.600 --> 57:16.800]  honey banana hash. That's for sure. I'm just calling it right now. And as far as like a
[57:16.800 --> 57:22.880]  work that I'm doing that I think is going to be cool, like I'm doing the BLR Wilson sound
[57:22.880 --> 57:28.480]  interesting. You know, just everybody else's pedigree, cross to Wilson. I'm going to hunt
[57:28.480 --> 57:33.120]  through those and see if there's anything special. And I think I did a bunch of gelato. I did a
[57:33.120 --> 57:39.040]  bunch of skittles already. I did the Cushmans. I did the fritters. I'm going back to the old
[57:39.040 --> 57:45.440]  school. I'm even growing through like some regional stuff, bulk cash, Hindu Kush, so on,
[57:45.440 --> 57:51.680]  so forth. The Acapulco Gold, the Cuban Black Hazes. I'm interested in this stuff personally,
[57:51.680 --> 57:55.680]  and I'm trying to tell the people that this is what you want as well. So that's kind of what
[57:55.680 --> 58:00.160]  I'm doing in 2022. Yeah, another great Washington company that's doing some big stuff, and I'm
[58:00.160 --> 58:05.200]  working with them, House of Cultivar. And I got some of their stuff here today. Actually, it's
[58:05.200 --> 58:12.640]  really fire. But Jason Hutto is like, you know, he is a pheno hunter at heart. He's doing some
[58:12.640 --> 58:17.520]  breeding. We're doing some stuff together. But like some of the stuff he's working with some
[58:17.520 --> 58:23.200]  lime turps that are just frigging. This cherry lime is amazing, and it's expressing nice,
[58:23.200 --> 58:29.760]  strong cherry notes, expressing lime. You know, I can't say enough about some of the stuff that
[58:29.760 --> 58:34.000]  they're doing. And if you look at it, they have a grand crew lineup up in Seattle, and all the
[58:34.000 --> 58:40.160]  stuff is fire. You know, I've had friends mistake it for living soil. Yesterday, we had somebody,
[58:40.160 --> 58:43.200]  I'm not going to mention who, but he was like, man, this stuff, because I had some living soil
[58:43.200 --> 58:46.320]  stuff. He's like, oh, this is fucking amazing. I'm like, that's not the living soil stuff. That's
[58:46.320 --> 58:50.640]  the stuff that's growing with salt. But they're doing a really good job with what they have, and
[58:51.600 --> 58:55.920]  using some unique terpene profiles. He's breeding towards some amazing stuff. We got some seed
[58:55.920 --> 59:03.440]  releases coming down the road. So expect that. House of Cultivar, our time's loud. So good stuff.
[59:05.600 --> 59:10.800]  Archive Skittles. Yeah, I smoked some rainbow belts that my buddy grew out. It only washed 2%,
[59:11.440 --> 59:16.800]  but it tastes really fucking good. Can't go wrong with that. And I'm, you know,
[59:17.760 --> 59:23.920]  just looking forward to getting in some hash as well, some mixonic melts going or something
[59:23.920 --> 59:28.560]  around here in LA. Yeah, Compound's got some shit coming out, too. The apples and bananas crosses.
[59:28.560 --> 59:34.800]  There should be some heat in there. He's got apples and bananas times Khalifa Kush, I believe,
[59:34.800 --> 59:38.480]  I think. Yeah, Chris said he was going to send me some, so I'm going to hold it against him.
[59:38.480 --> 59:43.360]  Yeah. Even now more so. Dude, yeah, I mean, I love, we have apples and bananas right here,
[59:43.360 --> 59:47.360]  and the terps on that, it's a good one. It's a good one to breed with, I'm sure.
[59:49.680 --> 59:54.720]  Yeah, a lot of fun stuff. Ganja Farmer Seed Company, check us out. We were giving away some
[59:55.520 --> 59:59.760]  Ganja Farmer stuff yesterday. We got some Ganja Farmer stuff today. We got the
[59:59.760 --> 01:00:07.360]  Yo Sea Time, Stiletto 41. So that's Ganja Cowboy. Do you see this question?
[01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:14.240]  Can you define selfing? Is it a clone plant of a plant that you trick into a male and, yeah,
[01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:20.800]  basically what you do is you spray silver on it, and that blocks the ethylene. That process
[01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:25.920]  makes it express male, even though it's a female, and then you take that pollen and put it back on
[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:31.040]  itself. You can either put it back on the actual plant or a clone of the plant for it to be a self.
[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:34.880]  Some people will reverse half a plant and then pollinate the other half. Other people will
[01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:40.880]  reverse the whole plant and pollinate a clone of itself. And then basically that generation,
[01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:45.120]  you're getting rid of the alleles. 50% of the alleles are gone. Now you're just working with
[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:49.600]  the alleles from that plant because normally you have the alleles sets from
[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:55.680]  two plants that you're pairing together. So you can basically stabilize stuff or you can reinforce
[01:00:55.680 --> 01:01:04.320]  shitty bad traits a lot faster by selfing. So a lot of good stuff. Male herms exist.
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:08.560]  You say a lot of people are selfing the shitty ones. Oh, yeah. I think a lot of people were
[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:13.680]  doing. Yeah. The thing is, is like if we can now breed with science and we could do data driven
[01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:17.920]  breeding and all this cool shit sequencing and all these things have a place and I think they're
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:23.360]  awesome. But a lot of people make mistakes. And the reason we're out with hermaphrodites,
[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:28.480]  the way they are is because of bad genetic work that's been done over the last three years. On
[01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:34.080]  top of the good stuff, there's been a lot of bad stuff because we didn't know, because people were
[01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:39.600]  just breeding to breed. And I remember I used to hear, you know, even three, four years ago that
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:45.360]  cherry pie is prone to hermin. A lot of stuff, a lot of stuff has cherry pie. You know, a lot of
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:52.880]  stuff have these herm prone genetics. Yeah. Even, you know, chem 91, it created the sour diesel.
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:56.560]  That was a herm. A lot of backseats. You know, the other thing is we wouldn't have these awesome
[01:01:56.560 --> 01:02:01.760]  backseats without without the fucking hermaphrodites, without that expression.
[01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:08.400]  So safe to say it's, you know, there are differences where plants totally express
[01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:16.160]  intersexual traits and they only express under like super stress or as a mechanism for survival,
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:20.400]  which is, you know, that's OK. If you have stuff that pops the seed here,
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:24.480]  see, that's not a big deal. But when it frigging creates a whole plant of seeds,
[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:29.520]  that's when it's garbage. Cookies, cookies is not the most sexually stable plant. That is for sure.
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:36.960]  It reverses super easy. Chem four is very pine. That was a statement, I believe.
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:43.120]  Chem four is OK. It's never been one of my favorites. I like the 91, the CIS, the Chem D.
[01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:57.860]  I had a male herm this last grow, had a female top pop out late in the male pollen. Did it
[01:02:57.860 --> 01:03:03.540]  pollinate? You get seeds. It's interesting, I guess. Yeah, I don't think so, though.
[01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:08.740]  I had my male get really frosty and grow flowers, and I thought it was just frosty,
[01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:13.060]  but it was actually reverse. And I had it in the potter for more than a year and I was just trying
[01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:18.340]  to live longer. It's not possible to make feminized seeds from a male, just so you guys
[01:03:18.340 --> 01:03:23.380]  understand that. Yeah, I can't reverse it. And I didn't get any seeds from that. It was just
[01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:26.740]  flower clusters that you could smell. It has to do with the chromosomes.
[01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:35.660]  Any advice on your Offendo and your JuiceBox? Grow them. Don't save them. Grow them now.
[01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:42.700]  As far as to get them to express better, I would say that they were made indoors. They've been
[01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:49.500]  tested indoors. We've seen some people grow them good outdoors. Offendo is friggin' super funky.
[01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:55.260]  Big ups to Kyle on the Offendo. That's his name. That's his variety. But also Marlon,
[01:03:55.340 --> 01:04:01.740]  friggin' huge fan of GMO. We love the Offendo. And you can find what you're looking for if you're
[01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:06.700]  going out. You're looking for one that has a little bit of the gelato and strong, pungent GMO
[01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:13.340]  terms. So at least that's what I'd like to see. When we were pheno hunting, we were growing them
[01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:16.780]  out. We just did it in Nassau, Long Island, California. Check some out. And I really liked
[01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:19.980]  the ones that were pungent, but just had a little bit of the hint of the gelato.
[01:04:19.980 --> 01:04:24.780]  Also the ones that flower a little bit shorter. So juice box.
[01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:38.470]  Actually, I have a question. Edgar, in the Compton backyard, what kind of pests are you dealing with?
[01:04:38.470 --> 01:04:45.350]  Oh, there's a, if I don't spray for like one week or two, I'll get some soft-bodied aphids.
[01:04:45.350 --> 01:04:47.750]  Every now and then I'll get a clone from somebody.
[01:04:48.710 --> 01:04:52.070]  What do you kill your russet mites with? You don't. You just kill the whole plant.
[01:04:52.070 --> 01:04:56.790]  Oh, so you can't, I mean, I treat it. So russets, I use micro-thiol disperse.
[01:04:56.790 --> 01:05:01.350]  I did try to do like a sulfur dunk and I have sulfoyl eggs.
[01:05:01.350 --> 01:05:06.710]  Yeah. The only one product that works, it works for PM and it works for russet mites is micro-thiol
[01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:08.710]  disperse. Micro-thiol disperse.
[01:05:08.710 --> 01:05:10.550]  It comes in 50 pound bags for 50 pounds.
[01:05:10.550 --> 01:05:13.510]  Yeah. And it's a good, it's a good, it's a good, it's a good, it's a good, it's a good,
[01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:15.910]  it's a good, it's a good, it's a good, it's a good, it's a good, it's a good, it's a good, it's a good, it's a good, it's a good.
[01:05:15.910 --> 01:05:21.030]  It comes in 50 pound bags for 50 bucks. If you buy a 50 pound bag, it'll last you five years.
[01:05:21.030 --> 01:05:25.270]  Out of the whole yard, uh, it's all pretty healthy for the most part. The only things
[01:05:25.270 --> 01:05:31.030]  that don't look good are the things that I just let roll in the pot to maybe revege on me. But
[01:05:31.030 --> 01:05:36.870]  for the most part, uh, the pest pressure isn't as high. Uh, there's a little, whatever plants are
[01:05:36.870 --> 01:05:42.470]  PM prone are, might get hit. Cause there's a heavy Marine layer right where I live at.
[01:05:42.470 --> 01:05:47.110]  I'm like probably 15 minutes from the beach. But besides that, that's also a good way to
[01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:52.550]  choose what's not PM prone when I'm making more seeds for whatever.
[01:05:52.550 --> 01:05:57.110]  Yeah, that's a great form of stress test. It's awesome. But yeah.
[01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:06.120]  Do you give seeds to mothers or a different feeding schedule? I feed all my plants the same
[01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:12.120]  shit. My system is to make seeds, and I found that I do the bare minimum. I get away with
[01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:17.400]  murder back there. Do you make seeds from seed plants or do you make seeds from clones?
[01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:21.080]  I do both. Nice. So sometimes you'll pop it up and you'll be like, I like this one. You're
[01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:25.000]  going to pull it out. Well, it's going to get pollinated regardless. So it's like
[01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:31.720]  say I pop 10 chocolate, heavy pop 10 of this strain, right? Yeah. One is going to be the best
[01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:38.840]  one. The other seeded ones. Yeah. Kind of sell them as is like, oh, this is not the good one.
[01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:45.400]  Or maybe there's different, they're all good, but one is the sweeter one. One is the bigger yielder.
[01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:51.560]  One is the so forth. And you can go further and actually pop them and get more notes. But as far
[01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:57.000]  as that's concerned, I do clone only hits. I'll go grab apple fritter. I'll go grab this. We'll
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:03.320]  snize it or I love popping seeds. So I have tons of fucking seeds. Wow. Yeah.
[01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:06.600]  So I got to get going, guys. I got to get to the airport here in a minute,
[01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:13.000]  but I'm going to leave Masonic here with some seeds. He's going to give them out. It's a secret.
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.960]  You got to come to the shop. You got to ask for them. You got to give them the secret
[01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:23.400]  handshake with the one finger down the shocker handshake. Yeah. So yeah.
[01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:27.560]  So actually, James, before you go, we had an entire show on this.
[01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:32.600]  Where did the sour diesel come from? People keep asking. And it's like we have a whole
[01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:36.360]  bunch of people asking. And it's like we have literally I think there's like 40,000
[01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:40.760]  views on it or something like that. But sour diesel came from a backseat of the Kevin 91.
[01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:47.400]  There's some people claim that it was bread, but that's not true. You can look at the filos.
[01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:50.920]  Do you approve it to me? Actually, you know what? I'm not going to say that you're wrong. I would.
[01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:55.320]  But I would love it to get some other proof. If you think sour diesel was bread or that it's
[01:07:55.320 --> 01:08:00.600]  any different than the story that Mojave Richmond I talked about on Instagram and on
[01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:06.520]  that we did with Peter, hit me up. Send me send me what you know. I know there's some guys that
[01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:10.200]  are released. I'm not going to try to argue with them. They have regular sour diesel seeds. It's
[01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:16.280]  not even possible from my perspective. You know, I'm trying not to hate on people. I'm a very
[01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:21.320]  remedial knowledge. Like you can't have a regular star. You can have a S1 of it, but you can't have
[01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:26.440]  F1s of sour diesel. That's it's a clone only. It's just like Chemdog. There is. It's a clone only.
[01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:31.800]  It was a backseat. Sour diesel is a backseat of a backseat. And if they did find like the original
[01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:37.720]  mom and dad, like it would be it would it's madness. I can't even explain it. It's not going
[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:43.400]  to happen. I think it's totally wrong. No. And, you know, if you claim sour diesel was made in
[01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:48.600]  reg seed form, prove it, because I don't think you can. But but I'd love to see the proof. I'm
[01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:53.080]  not going to hate on you. You want to come on my show. You want to discuss it. We can get. Yeah,
[01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:59.000]  we can definitely get Greg's opinion for Chemdog. He's the one who's verified a lot of stuff.
[01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:05.960]  Mojave, Richmond and I are huge sour diesel fans and have loved the variety. And he can trace it
[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:10.440]  back the ancestry of it back to who he got it from. And, you know, it's like there's a lot
[01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:18.580]  of conversations to be had. But sour diesel, one of the best clone only only. That was my first
[01:09:18.580 --> 01:09:23.220]  pound of weed was sour diesel. Love sour diesel. We're just talking to Dougie from him, man. He
[01:09:23.220 --> 01:09:28.500]  loves sour diesel, too. That's his. That's his jam. That's my jam. I love it, too. How's Dougie
[01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:33.700]  doing? I should you not. He's a Boston boy. Yeah, he just had a birthday. He's happy. He's a good
[01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:40.420]  guy. He's Dougie's like the king of reinventing himself. I just and he's successful at everything
[01:09:40.420 --> 01:09:47.780]  he does. He's he he has a really, you know, different outlook on everything from glass to
[01:09:47.780 --> 01:09:50.900]  chalice, rocking chalice. Now he's got his clothing company, Hitman Clothing.
[01:09:52.260 --> 01:10:01.220]  Yeah, I remember I did an event at Hitman at the coffee shop and had no idea that it was like it
[01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:09.300]  was the last event ever there. I think the last cannabis event. And like after like he was just
[01:10:09.300 --> 01:10:13.940]  like all bummed out and I couldn't and I was like asking him what was up and he was like, yeah,
[01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:20.980]  we're shutting down. The bummer that. But yeah, he just had a birthday. Hit him up with some
[01:10:20.980 --> 01:10:28.420]  help. Happy birthday on Instagram. Yeah. Good stuff. Marlon sends his love to everybody that's
[01:10:28.420 --> 01:10:32.900]  on the show. We're going to get him on here in a couple of weeks again to talk about Gunja Farm
[01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:38.580]  Seed Company. I got to talk about loud kind of next week. We'll be talking about some interesting
[01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:46.260]  stuff. New autos. We got some special guests. I got Sungrown Mids coming on. Trevor. Yeah,
[01:10:46.260 --> 01:10:52.260]  he's amazing. Yeah, it's like I like people who kind of tell it how it is. And I feel like he's
[01:10:52.260 --> 01:10:56.820]  one of those people. We need a Josh Dion here, too. I feel like he's another one of those people
[01:10:56.820 --> 01:11:02.180]  that loves. Yeah, I've been talking, reaching out to him for a while. And I think like you may know
[01:11:02.180 --> 01:11:07.780]  more than I do, but it seems like he went through some shit and just wanted to take a little time
[01:11:07.780 --> 01:11:13.700]  out. I sent him some beans. He wanted my Josh D Oji variety that I found. And I sent it to him.
[01:11:13.700 --> 01:11:19.060]  It's so funny because I just found a fact. I'm giving him the Trevor. But some of them. I just
[01:11:19.060 --> 01:11:25.300]  found a bag that was I did some regsies from back in the day with Marlon. We had the Gunja Farmer
[01:11:25.300 --> 01:11:31.300]  Oji with loud seeds. And I found my regs that are basically the Soma Oji cross to the kosher. And
[01:11:31.300 --> 01:11:37.620]  then that's crossed to the Josh D. And so the thing with Oji seeds and this is why nobody has
[01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:42.580]  a great Oji line. It's just Oji where you pop them. It's because it's a recessive trait. And
[01:11:42.580 --> 01:11:46.420]  most of the progeny comes out like garbage. And then you've got these outliers that are amazing.
[01:11:46.420 --> 01:11:48.980]  So you have to go through a lot of seeds, but there's good stuff in there for sure.
[01:11:49.620 --> 01:11:53.300]  Even though you're using three good breeding parents in there, you can still get stuff that's
[01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:58.900]  not desirable. OK, so things I'm learning today, we're doing a show next Sunday.
[01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:04.740]  We're going to do a show next Sunday, guys. OK. All right. So I'll carve out the 11 to
[01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:10.580]  one o'clock time slot. And is it going to be from this mythical new studio?
[01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:15.300]  Oh, we should do it for the new studio. Hopefully by then we can do it. We think
[01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:19.300]  we're still in the week for the new studio. The new studio set up and collecting dust.
[01:12:21.140 --> 01:12:25.860]  So anyway, guys, I really appreciate it. Thank you for coming on.
[01:12:25.860 --> 01:12:33.540]  Thanks for having me. Thanks, Peter, for hosting it. Yeah. I'm all to time. I was watching football
[01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:39.540]  and talking to you guys. So nice. Look, Jill, that's good. Is it a beer above your head?
[01:12:40.260 --> 01:12:46.660]  That is right. It's an empty one. As soon as we're done, I guess you go get a new one.
[01:12:47.300 --> 01:12:51.220]  Awesome. We'll have a great rest of your weekend and have a great week, everybody.
[01:12:51.220 --> 01:12:59.940]  Yeah. Thanks for tuning in. Thanks, everyone. See you. Go get that flight. Hell yeah.
