like that but I guess we're like in the same time zone. I was like over here trying to plot the
times and stuff I was like what an idiot dude this guy's in the same zone as me. Oh Michigan
eastern time I didn't know that. Yeah I had no idea either man I'm just like geographically pretty
bound to this little shore that we live on. Well so it's uh six o'clock for all of us then.
Yeah actually yeah all right.
All right well we are live so uh everybody thanks for joining us. I am in Narragansett,
Rhode Island right now and uh everybody is on the eastern time zone. Cam you're in Maryland right?
Yeah yep Maryland Delaware line. And then Jeff and Michael you guys are in Michigan?
Yep that's correct. Okay and Jeff you are in your music studio you want to
you want to give us the recap of uh what you do in there? Well this is um a especially large room so
I've set up my keyboards and we have little events with people here like um we we had a
performance here and it's just a really nice ambience for even like sitting here and and
doing this zoom meeting here it's just it's just a really nice place. The energy is really good here
is what I'm to make it short. That's killer man you do anything other than the keys?
You play any like other sort of instruments? Um well I have a crystal bowl that that is really
nice and I'm getting into percussion I'd like to get into drums I've been wanting to play drums
since I was like seven years old but my parents wouldn't let me have a kit because you know that's
too loud right so yeah it's just you know it's like a parent right so so yeah but that's about
it you know just that's the flow yeah how about you? What's that? Michael you ever get in there
and jam with that dude? I don't play any music right now like um I don't play any instruments.
Oh yeah oh good yeah I play I just play like a little bit of acoustic myself just like here
and there like when I was younger I got into like electric and all like jamming and smoking weed I
guess just kind of go hand in hand right? Yes yeah sure does. I just eventually started burning the
weed instead of playing the instruments a little bit more and it got away from it I guess.
Yeah well you should come back to it because it's really inspiring you know even if it it just is it
makes you feel really good to just to hear the tones and you know ringing in your ears and know
that you're making those tones. Well I want to come up to that organic cup and you and I are
going to have a jam session then how about that man? All right all right man we can we can have
a drum-a-thon too we can bring our percussion instruments and have a drum time. That'll sound
swell huh? Yeah every yeah free bongs. And did you both grow up in Michigan or how did you end up in
Michigan? Do you want to go with that Mike or should I? Sure well we were in Oregon right before
Michigan. We didn't stay in Oregon too long. We worked on a project briefly there and you know
didn't work out so we we kind of we've been going to Michigan for cups and we knew a lot of soil
living organic farmers here. When we came out to the cups we were just really impressed with the
quality of flower. A lot of people who were just focused on boutique grade not a lot of
not as much you know low quality stuff as we were seeing in other places and so I just got a good
feeling about it and when we came over here it was green there was water it was lush everywhere.
You didn't see signs of you know tree mold or tree death. I mean it was just like that's a it's
a thriving flourishing place and anybody that comes here you know will instantly realize that
and so we we just followed our intuition and we're like you know seems like Michigan's in the middle
of nowhere but fuck it you know we've we've pretty much uh dedicated our life to cannabis and um it
seems like this plan is leading us to Michigan. So we got out of um our situation in the west coast
during that time it was droughts and fires and it was not a good time for us and um so we're we're
what year was that? That was 2014 when we moved. Because there are fires every year so that doesn't
help anyone with like oh that was no you were in the year of the great fire in California.
Right the year the last 20 years that I was hearing that um when we were in Mendocino the
same stories like someone was telling me about like lightning strikes starting the fires and
then he was saying all of I think it was Willits had to evacuate a certain town that he was part
in up in NorCal and then they they everybody had to evacuate their homes and then he was like
it seemed like the um then there was like uh agents in everybody's home walking through and
just going through the you know it was kind of a weird situation. I didn't like the vibe too much
of just like you know not being sure and secure of your own safety and the future of your garden
and that just didn't really sit well with I think all of us so we we definitely were on the search
for greener pastures and Michigan seems to have all the green we could ever ask for.
And how did you guys connect in the first place? I mean where like did you grow up together? Did you
where'd you meet? Where'd you? No I actually um I actually was selling pot in Oakland, California
and Mike was a friend of one of my patients and I was always taking new patients.
So Mike began buying a lot of weed and he was really open to the I was breeding a lot and
trying new exotic strains and he was really open to giving me reviews and
you know all the wonderful smoke reviews that one really needs to decide whether they want to keep
it in their garden or not and I just asked him if he if he ever needed a job you know.
You know he was free to come you know work or help out with me. I just needed any kind of help
at the time and I just wanted somebody who was honest and somebody who had a brain and obviously
those were two of his you know lifelong traits so that was that was basically how the seed was
planted but then I'll let Mike tell the rest of it like how you actually you know decided you want
to work with me. And just quickly what what year was this and so you you were breeding in Oakland
so was that like a garage bro kind of or? Well no I had over I had like 2,300 plants and they were in
all over my deck and in my yard and some in my roof. I had like a I had a really low pitched roof
and it was faced towards the south so it was just beautiful for growing all kinds of shit you know
and I was in a beautiful spot you know I could grow Colombians, I could grow Vietnamese, I could
go highland Nepalese you know I was just I was just like a kid in a candy store at that place
you know and the beauty of it was I could go lay down for a while you know and then come back
wake up do it again you know so it was you could call it a home grow but it was it was my home
grow you know and it was very ambitious I mean and you could ask Mike it was because he helped
me water it was like a whole day to water the thing so and at the time we were just all we all
challenging the the 100 plant rule you know I just knew that I could do what I was doing and
and I just kept doing it. So you were 23 times over the 100 plant rule? Yeah yeah but you know
what there's I don't brag about that because there's guys that were like 50 times over that
and you know like my neighbors you know. Man that's a lot of hand watering too shit like at the end of
the day you're feeling that in your back and even your arm pump right? I did I did you know and I do
I do to this day. Yep I'm right there with you man I'm hand water to the end I mean machines cool
and all but that's when you're trying to get from point a to point b not to water your plants right?
Yeah well we got the teas and everything and see everything was on a slope and everything was
getting moved around and cold and you know new things coming in so it was hard to for me to kind
of even think of configuring a drip system plus the water you know in California is really short
right now so we had to think of that we had we everything was filtered you know I mean filtered
hard because that's some of the worst they think Flint is bad man wait till they test Oakland
I mean that shit will dirty a filter in in like five days so
and that's the weird part when it comes to organics too you know like if any of us are
trying to use like tap water we got to let it at least sit in the bubble you know because we have
no idea what's going into city water so like for us here salt is so bad and you go into certain
places it just smells like rotten eggs you know like it's funny people go take showers and come
out it's like you smell worse than when you went in there like yeah yeah it's yeah you can't grow
organic without making sure your water is free of chloramine fluoride arsenic and all the other
shit I mean when we were in Willits we there was a note notice that there was chromium in the water
you know and that's that's pretty toxic you know to to be bathing in and you know so
you know there's you really have to make sure because water is crucial to everything
really water is crucial to life so so how how did you do that in Oakland and and sorry what
kind of what year was this I mean or what years like we're catching up on the story so up until
you and Mike met so this was kind of let's say pre-Mike so you met Mike what year okay well
I had my first huge road on my in Oakland in 07 or 06 and 07
and I met Mike in 09 I believe and then we started working together in 10
and I may be off but yeah man so around that 07 what was that first mail that you guys kind
of started like you started playing with there do you remember well I had a I had everything
because because somebody had given me all their these beautiful genetics and and like I was handed
14 Mendo purples that were really they were just stellar and they were broadleaf and
some of them were males you know so I kept them all and and then somebody gave me some
Willie Nelson Nepalese Highland cross with a Viet Black and I had males of that
and then you know the list goes on it's like I had tons of males you know but I tried to keep
them in the garage at that time and collect the pollen and do all these breeding projects
it's like that first mail that you get that you're just really proud of I think you just
never forget it that's why I had to ask you know there's I wanted to know what was that mail for
you you know that's that's super cool I'll tell you I'll tell you the one that turned our life
around at Gage Green was the crystal locomotive that was the one that really set the stage for
the fire you know that you know just now isn't that what we did on that Mendo work right right
yeah a lot more yeah and it's still it's still there yeah so it's still in our work okay yeah
yeah because it was really strong you know genetic not so much the not so much the train
wreck but the aloha white widow I believe it really really perseveres so that's one like I
grew the the euphoric a while back I think what's that like the cherry puff and then the grape
stomper cross to that aloha that you had the white widow what's the story on that aloha white widow
widow I think it's been like you hear that and you're like oh that sounds like this crazy
exotic Hawaiian white widow you know I mean I'm only 28 so I hear white widow and I'm just like
what well yeah white widow was I mean it's a legendary strain that was created by
Shanti Baba and it's gone through a lot of drama and there's been a lot of people working in their
nurseries so but the story of the white widow that Gage Green used was Jojo Rizzo was a friend of mine
and he gave me a lot of this work that he had he had done by going to Amsterdam
to the aloha seed bank purchasing a pack of seeds and coming back and coming up with a male and a
female he liked him so much and Joe was a real weed stop okay so and so the male was used in a
lot of the work and the female he used in a lot of the work because he would kind of do the Romeo
and Juliet thing oh okay so yeah like his own versions yeah like his v1s and v2s in a way kind
of yeah yeah because that that's one that they go and I'd ran that for me in like two or three years
and it's just gorgeous had like very puffy calyxes on it you know but uh yeah I ended up getting a
real bad fissarium case a while back man and it just like snuck up on me I was still like a rookie
so I just didn't know what to deal with it ended up losing that one that was one of the sad ones
for me but yeah I just was always curious about the male and that because I guess the whole grape
stomper and aloha white widow it's like again being my age you hear white widow you're like
you know I've never even heard of a real cut of it and you know that people I know have it
so when I see guys like Gage I'm like ah dude if you if you can at least figure out what what they
were looking for in a white widow and then you know I don't know the whole just old school meeting
new school thing that kind of interests me so I think it's super cool that you guys would like to
work with that kind of stuff well one of the beautiful things about the whole ordeal was um
was that other people did a lot of the work you know for us just like we do a lot of the work for
other people you know so it kind of got passed along and Joe did a lot of the work with that
crystal locomotive and um you know just um and a lot of other he gave us the purple elephant
which was crucial in make making the grape stomper so um you know that there's just like this um
you know like give and you receive I guess you know and that's the that's the beauty of this
you know so we really we really like to give credit where it's due you know and is that and
that's where I'm wondering is that where all those names are that kind of come into play like Santos
High School Sweetheart like is that like is Santos the guy that helped find or is that just what you
named the cut like kind of like a person name I've been like dying so like um so when you're like
saying like Santos High School Sweetheart or like the Ralph Cut or you know is that like someone's
name or is that just what you named the cut itself like is that someone that helped or just
what you named the cut sometimes I name cuts kind of people names yeah I kind of like um I kind of
like to humanize them a little bit I guess so the males all have a male name and you know they may
be named after you know they're usually named after somebody that is really um spiritual in my life
so like Santos is a very spiritual person um High School Sweetheart that's just kind of like a play
on things and I you know we love to be um you know tongue in cheek at times you know with our
with our names we're not all about serious you know things that you have to decipher but
it's you know it's all good man you know I think that's a really good question that you just asked
well I because I had always wondered because um actually that's why so down the bottom here we've
got Dan Kesey joining in on us he's um I had gotten the Grape Stomper Cross High School
Sweetheart from him where he'd done the selections on that and uh I don't know I was just like oh I
see the Santos cut I was like is this a guy named or is this like the name of the cut that they had
picked so that's where that had kind of come from but yeah so that's Dan down there Dan runs a bunch
of guys's stuff um and he crosses and then he's like super kind and him and I've been trading
stuff for a little bit I'm actually waiting for him to he's working on some Mendo Breath S5's
that he's going to send out my way I think I'm going to try to hook him up with a bunch of Sky
Cutler Kush stuff I've been playing with so hopefully that's equivalent to the Mendo Breath
stuff man because that stuff is just killer like I run the uh the Lucid Dream and man the Mendo that
comes out with that like it really takes blue like you know there's all those shitty jokes about Blue
Dream how it's just like not good but like man that menthol from the Santa Cruz cut comes out
in the flavor but you just get that potency that you just like oh my gosh man like the the breath
work in general is just so good so like that and then I guess I run the Hammerhead which has got
the Seattle Sour and the Mendo Breath and dude that is just again it's really funny was that
yeah that was that your the picture yeah that's my personal cut that I run of it and then I run a
different cut I actually work in a Medgram a genetics guy over there and the propagation
and vegetation dude so I got a cut over there that's just like short and squatty like the Mendo
Breath she like has this like sparkly purple hint to her oh my gosh and honestly man that's a
question I got for you too like the Seattle Sour like what was that so that had CBD tricks to it
right um Mike can uh answer that better than I can yeah the Seattle Sour I'm actually not too
certain of the exact cross or the lineage it was just a clone that one of our partners
was growing and it was just phenomenal had like um had a very very clean kind of chem 4 sour d
but it tasted like air you know just real clean gas um almost a little bit of a what we think of
as skittles that lemon that lemon lime kind of fuel flavor and it was just a phenomenal cut it
was not an heirloom I wouldn't say I believe it's a seed selection from somebody you know a friend
of a friend and and it just so happened to be called the um Seattle Sour I'm not exactly sure
um if it is like any relationship to a pure sour diesel which sour diesel or what the cross is
exactly um so I can't I can't exactly say but it was just it was a amazing dab plant hash plant
um incredible for extraction just great yield so we loved it and it translated really well as a
mother so I'm glad you got a good selection out of her oh man that thing was fantastic and so what
uh what generation was the Mendo breath that you guys had used for for that one so the Mendo breath
that was used in um the crosses like the floor root the hammerhead and um you know that group of
crosses were all with the f2 Mendo breath so basically we never released the f1 we um we I
think the first cross we made with the OGKB was the Mendo breath and we only made a handful of
seeds that we split with uh NorCal and basically then we um made f2s those f2s were the only um
was the was the first drop of Mendo breath you know to the public and then we used those found
a good selection from the Mendo breath f2 and that's where hammerhead came from floor root
and the f3s man I was just stoked to find like two like fairly opposite that's why I was like man
I wonder what generation both of these were because I'm just seeing like a really cool like balance of
one and then I'm getting the like gorgeous like I was saying earlier the Mendo breath dominant one
which is just again like she's just stallion I mean she's uh it's pretty wild too like I don't
even want to say it out loud because I know so many people are seeing these crazy COAs but total
cannabinoids she was testing around 28 29 so I was like really stoked to see how like she gets
potent man and then there's a tiny bit of CBD in there it was only like I think like 0.7 0.8 or
something like that but uh but either way man she's just like a stallion across the board like
she's bigger gorgeous in color in the bag um she's just a champion man she doesn't she doesn't take
any humidity issues that we deal with I don't know I assume you guys probably do most of your work
indoors I'm not sure if you do it outdoors at all but here on the eastern shore man we battle
with humidity like no else like I know it's not bad like Hawaii or anything like that but we pretty
much live underwater the last like two or three months of summer of pretty much fall into summer
and uh man it's it's one of those things that camera head just handles it dude so I couldn't
tell if you guys even bred that outdoor I believe you did you know like everywhere you go there's a
humidity issue I mean of course where you are it's most likely worse but like here in Michigan
it's really bad you know PM is the big thing um humidity control is a big thing like we have a
giant quest in a small indoor space just to make sure that the humidity just gets zapped out of
the air as soon as it goes um you don't want it to linger you know what I mean and there's little
tips like because you want to you want to go overboard with your dehumidification you don't
want to be trying to catch up in any way whatsoever so we we go all out but the way we breed
and the way we grow is why you don't experience issues you know like the the genetics the
epigenetic I guess you could say programming where they become resilient to fungal pathogens
when they're trained to be when they're trained to be you know like stronger um we give them
the herbs the mushrooms the probiotics to where that you know in the environment is dialed to
where that basically breeds a genetically resilient plant I know a lot of people will say oh like we
breed in you know in PM to do our selection and all that that's no that's that's weird you know
because our plants and our moms are clean because they're grown to like I don't want to say
perfection but to their potential so that they can fully express their genetic and innate ability to
defend themselves from from pathogens never will we give our plants and our parents a fungicide
which kills the salvestro you know plant you know you know chemicals like plants natural
bio-defense system that protects itself from pathogens that's no longer needed and when the
plant no longer uses its own immune system you get a defunct tasting plant you get a plant that
doesn't boost your immune system and and then you you make seeds out of that that's just disgusting
and I'm telling you most breeders do unfortunately and it's through seeing some of the practices of
people like you say you got thrusterium that's that comes from somebody with a dirty garden
you know and somebody who passed you a clone or um you or no yeah most or you got a seed with it
you know and that and it's like because somebody along the line didn't take care of it for before
they gave it to you you know like I handed you off a sick child and they got your whole family
sick I don't know you know like whereas like there's a difference between how you you raise
your your garden and how you how you ensure that no compromises are taken you know and so that's
something that we talk about a lot and we focus on because we want genetic integrity we uh we want
genetic dominance we want you know resiliency and that's what you get when you work with our seeds
well that also like that segs me into so we're a big one on like so I mix all my own soil and
where we got that therium issue was actually our peat moss source it was it was a big bummer man
I think a lot of people had issues that year and and I you know like again I don't use fungicides
so we couldn't do like a soil drench or anything so what I did was we started growing a bunch of
trichoderma ourselves and we actually tried to make a coco coir and it ended up like helping out
with a lot of plants but by the time I realized what happened like I was so far in the weeds with
it you know what I mean um so I you know again that was one of the ones I was super sad to lose
like um it was a handful of them but with that like with you segwaying into the like mushroom and
you know again so I'm also into like we use mushroom compost where we are um what what fungus
spores are you guys using with that mushrooms like spores that you guys are growing with that
stuff super interesting to me so like like what what type of fungus are you guys using for like
those spores I guess is more of the better question we do have spores and our reishi is
cracked cell wall um it's 30 percent with the reishi hot water extraction so because you know
a lot of mushrooms are chitin based and they don't break down in our gut the herbalists have basically
boiled it and extracted it so that it becomes an instant water soluble tea and that's what
we're using so includes spores and includes uh fruiting body and and mycelium here and there we
currently focus on the fruiting body um and basically it's the stuff that we take it's the
most potent medicine that you can get for um I don't want to use the word medicine let's say a
herbal herbal supplement you can find and we basically used it with tremendous results and so
it just made sense to try it on the plants I've heard uh hearsay information that it had benefits
I started doing my own research started using it myself seeing the results and then finding out that
you know there's patents on this in other countries so we use reishi we use lion's mane we
use cordyceps we use chaga we use turkey tail as well as a new addition which is the agaricus blaze
eye and tastes like it tastes amazing it tastes like almonds so like when you make a tea out of
it it tastes like you're you made almond um buttermilk like if you put a little coconut
milk in there it's just incredible but anyway yeah like these they're not actually they're
actually the extraction from the mushrooms um and I highly recommend you know growing actual
mushrooms whether it be oyster mushrooms or um whatever you can get to survive in the soil pots
but we add these is basically like a supplement and they basically work almost like a
immune booster so I I don't see you know mold I don't see issues um and our plants are really
vigorous from beginning to end and it's it's hard to say I'd ever stop using it because I actually
tried to and I was just like very disappointed in um the results of the garden and so I just
started using it again it's it's um some the the mushroom formula the herb formulas we make you can
you know take and make your own tea or add to your own smoothies it's it's food you know the highest
food grade human grade herb you can get that's killer man that sounds like so you just like took
a bunch of like the healthiest varieties that I've even ever heard of probably and just basically have
it all together man that's so smart is that last variety related to Paul's team it's a agaricon
kind of like the agaric family yeah there's a uh garicus you know and a whole bunch of different
agaricus type mushrooms and yeah I'm like not super into the whole mycology world I'm like
trying my best with you know like I started with mushroom compost and I'm working my way up you
know obviously all of us probably gone a little bit you know we go down the psychedelic route and
stuff but as far as trying to figure it out myself you know like I have no idea what's been
grown in the the mushroom compost I've been getting we know the guys are completely like
down-to-earth organic farmers and I've actually been working with them teaching little knf
practices themselves so like that would be kind of cool to like see how that tree like changes maybe
the mushroom compost or anything but at the same time again I'm not like a mycology guy I've just
been growing weeds since I was a teenager and you know like I'm just going more organic each season
I feel like and that's again that's why I like when Peter asked me to bring on someone that I
thought about with my genetics and I was like man like the only people I can think of that I run
there a lot of their stuff it's consistently good I know they practice the same things as me
organics wise I had to come gauge was like the way to go so I'm super stoked you guys are just like
talking to me about organics in general you know it's a big deal to to show like I don't think
people understand the importance of breeding with organics so it's super cool like Michael just
touched on that man because I like I make seeds myself just so that I have stuff all the time and
I just like you know pollen chuck my own stuff here and there and give them out to friends and
like no matter what they're just like dude your stuff's like solid because it's like good genetics
like no dude it's solid because it was grown organically it was grown right and I think the
plants that's going into it were happy you you could have took like the worst bag seed and grown
organic and I think made seeds on it you're probably still gonna find something fucking
awesome just because the plants are happy right like yeah organic can transform the expression of
the genetics so just like you can see in a person when you put them on an all organic you know diet
and you take away all the pharmaceuticals and toxins that they've been taking they transform
and we're living proof of it and we have people on our team that are changing their lives daily
and we get messages you know that are like I don't even dare say what some of these people say to us
because I don't want them coming after me but these are these are life-changing techniques and
we implement them on our plants and our pets and our and our people um Jeff is a huge Jeff has like
always focused on like I don't I hate using the word integrity because you know the whole
Tegrity Farms thing integrity from Jeff integrity it's about it's about it's about honor and it's
about doing things the right way from the very beginning and that's something that like I don't
think I would have had that basis had I started a company with other 20 year olds you know like we
we would have we wouldn't have had that foundation and Jeff has like um 40 years of entrepreneurial
experience over me and he basically said like from the very beginning that we were going to do this
right and he showed me things like that I never knew about I talked about this in the organic cup
at the organic cup but like you know the wood we get these days it's all pressed board it's
it has formaldehyde or has um other toxins that when um your room gets about 80 degrees in the
summer volatile volatile organic compounds are released and these these compounds are being
breathed and they cause all types of illnesses and it's because of the toxicity and the plastic
I don't say plastic the synthetic artificialness of the environment that we live in that not a
single aspect of it is even real and back in the day cabinets and furniture were made out of hardwood
it was solid wood from the tree I'm not condoning you know going cutting trees but
but we're you know we're using like glue wood it's like sawdust sawdust is so cheap and it's
it's because people have lost their their cognizance their ability to become aware of
what's happening and so they've allowed cheapness to persist not just persist but take over and
one of the things that we did from the very beginning was we focused on taking care of the
plants the organic way whether or not we were sacrificing yield whether or not we were um going
to have to battle this fusarium head-on whether we were going to have to battle this broad might
ship head-on we weren't going to use you know avid we weren't going to use eagle 20 I mean
when all my friends did you know everybody around me was and and dude they're they're making money
you know their facilities are big but we're but we're I mean but you know you don't know who they
are like but people know who we are because we're focused on on our craft on being 100 percent
conscious of every aspect of our garden and our growth so that's something Jeff really instilled
that's that's a crazy thing too man it's like people don't realize all that stuff like at all
you know like think about all the like you go and you see someone's cool backyard and they'd made
their own like above ground planter and you see this like gnarly wood sticking out you're like
oh shit man like that's not gonna be super good for your plants and you know what I mean but yeah
dude that's like that's eye opening stuff and we were just looking over at Jeff I don't know if you
realized you had an album covered there the whole time that light was coming in on you like a golden
god over there but uh you know that's cool I noticed that too you know isn't that cool right
but uh it's one of those things man people don't understand how important that that oversight is to
have a good friend or someone that you can just trust that just they can tell you the reality and
the truth of what you're doing and what they believe and you can take that you know what I
mean and take that in stride so that that's that does show you know what I mean it's super cool
to see that the company's built off of two guys just got it man you guys just got past each other's
things and you did your own shit and that's fucking cool man all right so while there's
a break here can I ask a question to Jeff or Mike please all right so a huge portion of your
breeding program was done from the male called the Joseph OG or at least that's what it was
labeled on the packs I believe you guys called it Josh where did that come from or could you
guys give us a little background information on what this backbone of your program was
Jeff do you want to describe it you're muted you're muted tap on the bottom left
let's give him a second do you see the little audio icon
guys know that Joseph OG originated from a grow I was doing in
in right before I met Mike it was oh
eight I believe or oh nine oh eight believe and
I was growing a lot of new things that were from Joe and from seed stock that I had
and at the time there was there was somebody that was working with me that knew somebody else
and basically a lot of the things that I worked with it that summer kind of came out of that
that that working arrangement that we had so the clone of the Joseph OG was found in my garden
after the person that had been with me for three months
attempted to poison my whole garden and Joseph was one of the survivors of that and
it's just something that I knew it was just kind of like telling me it was blinking
you know I'm there you know I'm I'm there for you and it was talk about this you should talk
about the guy that tried to poison your own whole garden and make off with your with your belongings
well he tried to take off with my belongings you know I mean it's kind of like people are weak
you know when you try to help them out and they're they have sociopathic tendencies
you know and this person is really tough
huh what's that I said you're really tough most people can't handle you
well that's that's correct but I had this vibe that he was stealing from me and he was stealing
from me so and you know like when you're sitting at a table with somebody and you have a beautiful
bud of super silver haze in a jar and you get up and go to the restroom and you were just looking
at it and you come back and that bud is gone you know like okay well you're starting to think what
is the work doing now and come to find out it was like it was it'll be a bad move so I caught it in
the bud and and he was thrown out on his ass you know so but anyways that regardless he left a lot
of work behind a lot of the work that he left behind had been given to us by Lumpo
so but the thing is I didn't use a lot of the work that Lumpo had given me
see it was it just didn't happen that way so the only thing that I really got and and that's
that's the story of the Joseph O.G. but that's how I got it all right well it's quite interesting
all right well that's quite interesting I sorry you had to deal with that my next question
pardon it well it was one of those life experiences you know that's what you deal
with when you know this industry is full of you know sociopaths and people that are just
out to take you down in some way or another
fair enough if you had to pick one strain what would it be out of your library
to do what to smoke to breed with to any anything what what has been your favorite creation so far
oh like the desert island question yeah there you go like if you can only take one
sprain or if you can only smoke right if you could only take one bud that lasted forever
what would it be that's a good one I know it's so hard to pick just one strain but
you guys have had so many iconic ones it's it's very hard I might go with Mendel breath however
generic that sounds of an answer it's a very complex plant it's got the gas it's got the
fruit it's got the color hits so why not I mean like but I my first inclination was to like bring
an old school OG with me you know yeah I mean I think a lot of people would be like old school OG
will just will deal with it well me and Peter were having a conversation and he was talking
about burgundy I have one of your guys's very first you know concoctions yeah black
that one definitely is a looker for sure that's really cool that you bring that up I mean that's
that's really like that's one of my favorites really but it just to tell you the truth I didn't
I couldn't get what I had the first time you know for one reason or another so that's interesting
so what uh probiotics plant I had one other thing your grateful breath f1 so you guys only
released the mendo breath f2s but you did release a few grateful breath f1s I don't know a handful
at a show or whatever it may have been um was it kind of the same scenario where you only got a few
and you decided to continue the genetics so the the story of the grateful breath was something
that we just kind of talked about on the podcast but they like deleted our episode for some reason
so we kind of got to we kind of touched on the story but it was a little bit of a fiasco and
it happened um right around 2014 when we were moving but uh excuse me the grateful breath f1s
we made one one pollination with and got a bunch of seeds that was the very first time we did it
it wasn't limited like the endobreath f1s so uh nor cal and us nor cal and me and jeff um
we uh we packaged them up and sold it and everyone was happy we did it again we were like let's make
more grateful breaths so we made more grateful breaths and then um sent them out to our dealer in
the uk his name was skunk monkey right around that time though he just started getting sick like he
apparently his house got broken into and his cousin was sick or something like weird shit
like your cousin's sick and then he just fell off like off the radar like i couldn't message him he
was taking days to get back to me when it was like only taking you know hours in the past and
i was just like this is weird and then so we somebody who volunteered to um help us out
i won't say any names just um but if you want to know he's from amsterdam wanted to be our you know
our help desk and so basically i was like hey like can you go get these seats from the uk
and he did well this guy ended up basically stealing them all from us so over like some
random you know created randomly created issue like you know how people are they can just find
something that they're not happy with you about and then say like they don't ever want to talk
to you again okay well you have all our seats you have like eighty thousand dollars worth of seeds
or something like that was supposed to go to like three people for a lot of hard work and that was
um that was basically one of the worst things that ever happened like we lost not just a grateful
breath drop but everything we were selling in the in europe and like like our whole you know lineup
and um we lost it all at once it was a huge setback but the worst part was like we weren't able to uh
pay norcal about it and and uh i kind of wanted to talk about that you know live because we were
we mentioned that in the podcast and um it's just kind of like a shitty thing and people kind of go
around they're like kind of claiming that we didn't pay norcal or whatever but that's what
really happened was like we got jacked and uh that's what happened with the grateful breath
f1s and so we made f2s with uh the grateful breath f1 hand in the solomon mail and that became
the um grateful breath f2s which as you know old anonymous has selected up from and a ton of you
know really fire has come from that but that's the story of the grateful breath so the grateful
breath f1s were the ones that dropped like and the f2s were a limited drop all right cool yeah
i've always wondered about that yeah the grateful breath is one of my favorites oh sorry yeah you
want me to elaborate on what mike just said a little bit is because um this is one of those
instances where where we really did take a hit and what happened was the guy was strung out on dope
you know like bad dope xanax and all other kinds of shit and so what he did was he tried to extort
90 000 from us and he hadn't he was supposed to be our agent and our dealer and give us you know
have an amsterdam desk for us and he didn't do a fucking thing while he was there you know so um
basically i was really pissed off about it and and this is and i probably you know i probably
made him even worse because i just told him you know he didn't he hasn't done a fucking thing and
he wasn't gonna get any money and then that was that he he just decided that he was gonna keep
the seeds and you know it just was um was a really bad thing you know and and that's that's kind of
the nature of people in this business you know like if if you see that people are really unhealthy
and they're strung out on some kind of bad drug you know it's best to just run the other way
you know because um you know you're not you're gonna get nothing but a bunch of shit you know
and that's that's just my advice but that's what happened to us and um it was a great learning
experience to tell you the truth well it's good to i always have learning experiences i find life
lessons to be the best ones but uh yeah i i'm a big fan of the grateful breath that is for sure
i know last cannabis cup we uh i smoked a joint with you or the last organic cup two cups ago the
first one we smoked some i believe it was on the porch but it was definitely tasty i'm a big fan
what uh is there anything coming up that we should be looking forward to from gauge green
oh yeah there's a lot of good stuff coming up right now um
mike you want to elaborate on some of the good stuff well yeah i just did a whole um phenol hunt
of you know brand new clones from several different sources uh i'm not sure if i can name
them all but uh belief you know and some of my other friends like we're doing some collaborations
uh with sunken treasure uh 808 genetics belief like i said and uh there's just some really cool
things happening um there's a poutine collab coming up with mass medical and so there's just
a lot of stuff coming out of the garden i've basically been hunting through like all these
all these different clones from people that they say that are good and um making sure that they
truly are what they say they are um making sure that they pass our selection standard so like if
i get a clone or i get a pack of seeds and this is for a collaboration or some kind of selection
i'm going to grow them all out to perfection or to their full potential let's just say and um
grow them for at least like three or four generations so that i see them perfected
perfected so i see them um cloned out grown out cloned out grown out more than more than a you
know two or three times i want to make sure that it's uh genetics hold up that it doesn't end up
auto flowering that it doesn't end up um herming it doesn't end up decreasing in quality over time
you know the so-called genetic drift which i think is just like genetic you know impotency
but like we uh i grow everything out i make sure that it's super strong that it's
in our you know i guess like trained to grow our method um so that they're they become
sugar exuders so that they become you know probiotic so they become symbiotic with the
probiotics so that they learn how to break down the soil um these are really important to us and
once that all happens then we then we will breed with them and so you can pretty much rest rest
assured that anything that's coming out has gone through that process you know that we don't just
get a clone and breed with it which basically that clone has not even got our vibe yet you know
we make sure that that clone is a gauge green team member and that it basically has gone through the
all the ropes like um and um anyways yeah that's basically the gist of it and so we have uh
this lava cake cut we are calling the spirit cut or spirit cake and it's just phenomenal it's a
grape pie which is grape stomper from jeff crossed with cherry pie and dim it and that um this cut
is just like really proven itself and so that's going to be fun to um work with there's also uh
some new uh diesels coming out we're working with aj we're working with the headband we're working
with um what else just a new oh yeah i saw the tk and the louis stuff you guys are working with man
like what's what's the deal with the louis like i you know over here on east coast land like we don't
we don't get the louis so yeah louis is uh one of the one of the old school original cuts i think i
mean i've heard it dates back to like the early 90s um just really caramel creamy uh i always
kind of see it as having like a bronze copper tone to it um but it's very it's very true to og
if you're if you have louis then you say you can say you have og kush you know what i mean that's
what i say um and it's a great yielder so we've made like um the asper rare which is which is uh
the word to breathe in latin and uh that's uh king louis crossed with joseph that was something that
we released a long time ago and now we have you know just different og cuts that we're working
with that we're gonna introduce and should be really nice i mean like at the end of the day
i feel like the us is known for diesel chem and og and that's like that's just simply a backbone
that i feel everybody wants and likes and loves so that's that's always going to be around and
um we're doing a lot of i guess clone selection from that category why don't you say that that's
why i just stepped away just for some chem dog actually i just got handed some dog patch so
yeah you're you're right man like the og the kush like the cans like whenever i see just like tk and
your guys's work i'm just immediately like eyes wide you know what i mean so like what what out
all that tk stuff are you the most excited about well we have we have a like we have triangle kush
basically like back crosses like um triangle kush cross with triangle kush cross with grape stomper
g cross with grateful breath you know um we have triangle kush crossed with high school sweetheart
we've dropped several you know recently that just sold out the triangle kush is like the oldest kush
cut right or one of the oldest i mean people will argue but it's definitely like older than the 92
i would say and it's um it's a finicky clone but if you look at our triangle kush or the way we
grow it in the ggg pop it's expressive you know it's fully rotund and and just stacking and it
looks like it's um a young young plant and that's what we strive to do with organics that's something
that i think organics is does is it revives you know older clones it allows us to breed with it
without losing vigor and allows us to grow it without losing vigor and uh it's something that
i've had to figure out because uh growing these older ogs has been difficult over time especially
with you know the plant diseases and um pest pressures that happened over the years but we've
managed to keep them healthy and and maintain them and just keep them vibrant and i think that's
what i'm most excited about is that we're breeding with one what i would consider one of the
healthiest triangle cushes today i mean like i see other people's triangle cushes and few of them are
able to grow a triangle cush to you know like what i would what i would say is like its full potential
and so that's really where we're at is taking these clones and reviving them giving them that
organic love and yeah just uh and then breeding with them yeah that's a man's shout out to our
buddy tk origins man love down there in the south wherever you're at he's he's been bouncing about
i guess florida with this facility and then traveling and stuff like that but that'll be
why he blocked us he blocked you guys yeah like there's i know that there's all sorts of reasons
right that people can have for why they might not like us or there's tons of people that talk about
us behind our back but organs origins tk when he first came out was like was pretty cool and
and i was like hey yo i love your story i love triangle cush and uh
could i send you some of our triangle cush crosses and he's like he's like uh yeah
said he you know sent me his address and then uh i sent him some seeds and then um it was like
a couple weeks later after he got it he just blocked us i was like that's weird you know i
mean with no with i mean for no reason so anyways that's kind of like some of the stuff that i see
behind the scenes you know like yeah you say he's a cool guy but he's not that cool to me you know
what i mean like at least he didn't treat me cool um he didn't send me no seeds like i was you know
like i was like dude you know i help you out you're coming you know starting to grow again this
and that like yeah so no love from that side damn man yeah it's a bummer to hear i mean i i'll always
have the respect because he held on to the cut and all that but that's definitely not like the
kind of character i get stoked to hear about though you know what i mean that's a little bit
of a bummer with with i guess like that whole weird character thing man like we hear you guys have that
killer ass cherry pie cut is that the same cut that cookie fam guys use like do you guys know
anything about that whole deal like what's so that's a good question and i've learned recently
learned more about it um i mean as you know like the claim is and we don't make the claim but
this is what we've been told is that this is the original clone that later on became cherry pie
thin mint and you know then became all this other stuff that we know which is all fire like don't
get me wrong right it's been it's been accepted and it's it's been proven in gardens and the stuff
is fire what's interesting though is that the you know cookie fam uh burner jiga s flux all those
guys it's just interesting that their story doesn't it doesn't work out you know what i mean
like i mean i'm not the only one that that thinks this or knows this and um what do you mean dude
f1 cross derb what are you talking about
so like it is the f1 derb right so um but we were giving it the cut and like it's the the story was
this is the predecessor and bag seeds were released into um the public and then people
got the bag seeds and and found tons of good phenos i mean and it's true cpk always drops
pollen like even in a light lightly proof room you know what i mean it's like sealed room it's um
yeah it'll just drop some lower balls and then you know it's like the plant the tree that keeps
on giving so it's actually not a very exclusive plant i mean if you knew us and you bought ours
you know or donated for a flower you would basically be able to find seeds in the cpk and
grow your own so-called cookies but the idea is like these guys basically like came after us and
and uh said we we didn't have like when we were growing ogkb and all this like you know came after
us and then turns out their story is a fraud cherry pie kush is definitely got all the qualities of
cookies everything you see except it's got an extra chem diesel and uh gas it's got like a
funk that you just you just can't replicate it just doesn't exist as to say in let's just say
the forum or the ogkb um and don't get me wrong these are phenomenal cuts it's just different
right it's just slightly different um and the cpk is something that we've had since we were in mendo
um we started the probiotic farmers alliance and grow kashi with this guy named alan and he ended
up basically um not giving us our 20 percent and like kicking us off the probiotic farmers alliance
like um because because he didn't like that i said talked about flat earth or something like
that you know what i mean it was anyways so um the uh cherry pie kush though was basically the
only thing i ever got that was good out of alan um and his brother has a grower and they they've
said they paid like eight thousand dollars for this cut um and i basically happened to get a
snipping of it and i didn't know how special it was until later on but we grew it out it's
definitely a phenomenal genetic and it has all the qualities that everybody loves and it stacks
and it yields it's definitely not a baby bud plant and um you know you've seen my pictures it's it's
it is what it is and so i'm glad you talked about like the self-seed thing man like the cherry the
10 that i run like i have a cut of your guys's 10s the cherry puff cross to the joseph and uh
man yeah i'll get like the little lower the little lower seeds like i won't find it in the buds but
i'll get it on like those little like you know where you'll see your second show like right
right below the calyx like you'll get this cool little like just it's seriously a single seed
per cola like it's kind of funny man like i can point out that yeah there's gonna be 12 seeds on
that plant you know but um it's funny because the people that do get those seeds are just like
i've seen it leading like yeah but you could start a whole fucking seed company off of that seeded
weed apparently so like you shouldn't be too upset you found some seeds on the bottom of that you
know yeah it's um definitely a great a you know a great thing to have seeds from from good genetics
you're getting it from the right grower you know and yeah what do you think jeff about the
cherry pike fish yeah it's phenomenal it's an excellent uh breeding parent and it grows large
and everything about it is superb i mean and so it just gets a 10 across the board with me
but to breed with it is a real joy and uh recently i hit um mine with a mr 66 which is a
purple punch aloe grape stomper and um and then we're we're working a lot of other things with
i know uh michael is doing a lot of stuff um but i plan i plan on hitting one with a
prominence i got a really nice prominence male so that'll be um
yeah it's just gonna be great you know it's beautiful i assume that's what was in the
cherry malawi cross because like i i've grown the malawi purple with the gold all that stuff
from ace when they i dropped i guess the fem side of it and that's when i was all into fens and
stuff but now i'm like oh why didn't i get the regulars and breed the malawi is so is that what
you guys use the cherry pie with the malawi for the cherry malawi no i um the cherry malawi was
bag seed that mike had picked out from some bud that it was our last harvest before we got busted
and um the seeds were really big and purple and mike selected them and put them in a bag and um
and um i had two of them that were that he had put in the bag and then i had another like eight
of them and so um they were actually purple so i you know and they kind of look like cherry seeds
they were so big so i just called it cherry malawi and um come to find out they were they were
probably self-made seeds because they just had these the clone that i used just had really
phenomenal traits to it in every regard the high the high was incredible quick moving long lasting
very cerebral a little bit uneasy if you smoke too much but um you know just a typical
great sativa you know the other day i stayed here the cherry malawi and then
my i was like in the garden and i started just to like not be able to catch my breath and i was like
what the fuck is this and it's like oh it was that weed i just smoked i had to stop and like
count to 10 you know or whatever just like catch my breath man that's that's killer we got this
purple malawi cut and i remember man i was driving like basically where we live we live on like a
sea isle so it's just like a sandbar that's we're probably gonna sink in like 10 years or something
like that but so when they're swell we're technically below sea level it's just a strip
it's north and south and uh man we had some purple malawi in the car and we're literally labeled one
two three four five six streets seven street eight street all the way up to 144 we're on like 138
street guys we were supposed to stop at 40th street should we turn around and go back it's like
i don't think we can turn around i think we should just keep thinking and listen to music
let's just go straight we end up in delaware like an hour later you know like that's just like
that good sativa like you're in the zone you're just having a damn good time right like yeah
sounds like fun man so i'm fun i i want to turn the tables for a minute um cam and dan you you
guys are both growing some gauge so can you talk about kind of what you're growing and how it's
expressing itself like how long have you been growing whatever you're growing you know what
have you learned about it how does it express itself as it grows how does it smoke as it smell
uh yeah i guess i can i have i've been doing high school sweetheart um for a few times
i saw i popped those i don't know late last year early last year i've been doing it for about a
year and a half or so let's put it that way i found two different phenos that i really like
i got one that's kind of like a berry gas very rock hard nugs and then i had another that was
kind of tall and spear-shaped uh buds but it was very very perfumey like a very floral perfume
like it was like old lady perfume it was pretty cool uh i'm a big fan of that one you can smell
that one all the way around the corner i'm curious though since it's back to the og or that's the cpk
right the high school sweetheart was the grateful breath to the cpk yeah okay but yeah i'm pretty
curious does that cpk come with really really rock hard nugs or was that just kind of a one
off in one of my phenos yeah it's rock hard it's just it's like um you know how cookies gets and
all the all the offshoots of cpk basically are super dense and uh that comes from the cpk
yeah the cpk grows from the inside out kind of stacks like and grows from the middle and is just
rock hard it's rock hard if you're interested in week five it's rock hard if you harvest it
in week 10 you know what i mean it just keeps growing yeah yeah well i've been taking mine
about 70 days or so so i like that 10 week it definitely fills out a lot um drastic in those
last two weeks it really just puffs up i'm pretty impressed i do have these mendo breaths going right
now i got from old anonymous um it's my first time with the mendo breath so i didn't i didn't
quite realize how uh heavy it stacks and how short it really actually stays um and all the
mendo breasts that you guys have grown have you had any off ones that grow crazy tall yeah i would
like you're you're probably working with the f3 is that correct yes the version m yes the f3 um
selected mother and the father was probably like a medium size the mother was definitely
squat and short and um that's i would say part of the fun of the f2 is that you see all all the um
varieties i guess you know you see so many different expressions and so there was like
tall medium short there was everything but you know that the mendo montage four star male
is a tall growing male as you know the ogkb is not and so there's everything in between
okay yeah but yeah the f3 that um old anonymous is working with is is a is a tight inner node like
small plant or like i guess short growing plant yeah most of mine are fairly short he he described
it as a short spot plant too what uh is there any advice to grow in a mendo breath should i uh clean
it up to the top let the stretch do the work should i you know what i guess you know what i'm
saying or no i it just depends on the clone you know like i learn every clone by watching it and
um seeing what it does with the baseline soil seeing what it does with my inputs seeing if
what it does water only seeing what it does with amendments and uh noticing whether it's a heavier
feeder or lighter feeder you know things like that i go i kind of figure those things as i go along
with every clone and i i figure you could have a you know a sister and a two sisters that grow
differently and but yeah the mendo breath will feed though like most gauge green plants you can
feed them yeah for the most part they all seem fair they can take or handle the a higher level
i seem to feed my i feed my worms pretty heavily which seem to feed the soil but
that's a whole nother ball game yeah i was just thinking about it i mean a lot of clones
they've been selected and grown in gardens that um are whether they be like light soil or light
nutrient feed and then they could also be selected in a garden that of somebody that feeds and you
know um and you can do this organically you know i mean whether it be a hot or light soil and that
also affects i think the uh end result but our plants from what i can see all all can take food
and want because they you know they'll grow yeah they definitely like the healthy biome i mean i
got a living soil bed that i got them in and i absolutely love it yeah they seem to love it as
well so awesome yeah you definitely see like the mendo breath she definitely just like as far as
the hammerhead goes man she stats like i mean it's the biggest nugs in my garden truthfully as
far as it goes i mean i'm not much guy that i don't ever really select for a yield that's never
been my deal i'm always like i select for smoke like i think at the end of the day like big butts
cool and all but if it doesn't smell good you're gonna smack that whole damn blood so but like
mendo breath man it's just like the yields there the smokes there the bag of peels there the
stockiness like as far as it goes like i don't select for stockiness right away that's usually
like my second or third run of the plan i'm like all right this smoked well i selected the cuts
like let me go through and figure out bigger then after bigger i from there i'm figuring out is this
something that i'm gonna smoke for the next three or four years and i've been smoking hammerhead for
three years it's been one of those ones that stuck around man like uh so yeah i i myself like i picked
up um some from dan that's actually i met dan was i got the grape stomper across high school from him
um and then i so i ran that for one good run i found one good cut that i'm still just on like
my third run with now that just kind of testing it out had the bigger she grows a little bit tall
and stretchy so i assume it was the high school leaner i don't know much about the grape stomper
truthfully but um so that's that one i'm waiting for you know this next round to kind of let me
know if i'm going to keep her around for good um i ran the threshold from you guys i drove up to
and to go meet bluebloods grow to go get uh the glue across high school sweetheart so that was
like i i didn't have a good glue in my garden at all i was like i'll drive a couple hours to go get
one from gauge so that was that was like my drive from there my wife and i packed the car up and
went up to boston or so sorry we went to springfield and then boston but uh so yeah i ran the
threshold just for one good run and i i found a really good keeper but i just kind of felt like
it was just such a representation of blue that i was like i'm just gonna go ahead and keep popping
through this other high school sweetheart stuff i want so i wanted something a little bit different
you know what i mean like if you glue dominates a lot of crosses so if i wanted to find blue again
like you can pop blue anything and it's gonna pop out but i was looking a little bit more for like
the the middle meat or maybe a little bit more of the high school sweetheart side but uh this next
run i've got some some v2s actually from uh dan of some high school sweetheart that i've got going
right now i uh i put 12 down i got eight up so i'm just kind of waiting to see what they do
um other than that i've been running the hammerhead and lucid for a couple years man and like
i the the thing that comes up the most about that plant and it's funny because people will come and
talk to me about the smoke and the like i said like they both have like killer coas and things
like that i always want to talk to them about how it roots i want to talk about cuttings like the
way those things root dude like it's crazy like i tag you guys in my cutting roots all the time
like i'm getting full 72 trays every single time with lucid like every single time and i i assume
i mean we all know blue dreams pretty easy to grow but i assume it's just a testament to like the
the grateful breath being strong genetics in there too man but uh same thing hammerhead she just roots
like a champ it's cool because of a hammerhead she just like she'll root and she stays the same size
until you take her out like you'll have a completely full rooted out little like whatever
you like to use i like to use rapid routers that's that's what it works for us at the medgro anyway
but like those things are so fully rooted out but they don't get any taller than that so it's just
like a dream to do anything for commercial with it and my cut now you're in person just just quickly
cam can you walk through what each of these are yeah so that's actually my cut of the hammerhead
there so that's a little bit of the taller um you see i like she's a little more puffy so i feel
like she's probably a bit more in the middle of like the seattle sour and the mendo but um the one
that we run over at the medgro she's just short fat tight nubs she's just like you can see the ogkb
but then you can just it's again it's like og on steroids with like this cool back end of like a
it's almost like floral really it's weird like it just kind of it's gassy but it comes out of
nowhere and hits you with this like i can't figure out what that undertone is i tell people
floral but i think that's like a hard scent to figure out um so yeah that's my personal cut of
it that's my number two and then the one i've run it sure is the number three and then that's lucid
dream that one that was just back there so that's the the santa cruz blue dream cross to their
grateful breath and like man you again i was saying something about it earlier like you get that menthol
from the santa cruz cut but the potency that comes out from the grateful breath it's insane like
it just hits you like and you get legs from it like i'm a big one on like i love good smoke like
but if it doesn't have legs to it then i can't really like keep going with it you know what i
mean so this is one that like you hear blue dream you're like oh bullshit that's good weed but then
you smoke it and you're like two hours later still drawing you're like this is super fun man i like
this it's like super euphoric super fun like that cut again like that's just my absolute favorite
thing to run like it just roots like a beast it's gorgeous in the bag it smells beautiful like so
that's why i like the breath work for me when i when i think of gauge i just think of the breath
work because of those two genetics like they're my two favorite things i run like no doubt
i guess i picture grape stomper i don't know that's me though
oh you like the grape stomper yeah i'm a big fan that was my first one i i had the original drops
from way way back in the day the purple elephant and whatever uh the purple elephant chem dog sour
diesel or at least that's what the package said um yeah i was a big fan i had some pure candy
grape turps when it first came out
i haven't found too many grape stompers since then or even bright moments since then that have
that like really really candy flavor that i had i don't know maybe i just got to keep looking i
still got some seeds left all right and then what's this one you're muted mike so yeah sorry
i was gonna say you need to search our grape stomper og crosses like uh the new grape stomper
crosses like uh the new grape stomper that we've been using with um it comes from mass cannabis
and mass genetics that won the la cup that shit is candy i did get the trizza or whatever it is
the grape stomper og aloha grape stomper og so i just haven't made my way to that pack yet
yeah you should find some old grapey stuff less of like the the fuel or the plastic he kind of
like great but more of like a candy grape right yeah i was after that candy candy grape the first
i guess real good cut of grape snapper i ended up getting was very joseph og very very og with
slight hints of grape on the back end of it very good though yields great it kills outside if
anybody wants an outside one grape stomper is a great outside yeah that was one like i wanted it
so bad and then i like i kind of found like a little bit of like that i think i got like a sweet
but i got a back end of gas like and i'm just so excited i think on the gas side of it i think i
kind of selected wrong and like you know like you get some crosses and you're like oh man i'm so
excited about this and then you make the selection towards like the opposite way you wanted originally
just because you found something that was super good you know what i mean i think i did that with
the grape stomper i didn't get really anything great about what i selected i got more of that
just like it's like a sweet it's almost cakey really it's almost like i guess the high school
sweetheart so i'm just coming out of it but again like i still found the one that i really like i'm
on the third run with it so we'll see what it does you know what i mean like i added again like
i'm just super excited just to find like something that's got that high school sweetheart tone to it
because again with that glue high school sweetheart it's just basically glue because i think just
dominates the shit out of everything that seems like all right all right and uh cam what's this
one so that's the 10 so that's like the that's the cherry puff cross joseph and uh that's the
one i was talking about earlier so we like i like stress the shit out of everything i really just
kind of put them through the ringer that first run and i'll get some like i said some bottom
seeds on the bottom of those and i don't really find it when i like baby them and you know do like
a really nice nursing job on but every once in a while like you'll find that lower that you're just
like oh cool i found a little cherry pie seed but yeah that's her that's the um the next picture is
the same the same 10 as well that one yeah that's her so yeah she just again i almost like like the
the mendo breath stuff man like she just nugs up like she's just dense like it's what you're just
saying like she just kind of grows from the inside out like you just watch her grow the whole time
like dude this thing could like knock somebody out if you use this like a flail or something
you know what i mean like she's just like this big old dense thing but uh yeah so that again that
one's like really cool and it'll like we can lower the temperatures and let it kind of dry out
at the end and she'll turn this beautiful purple and leaves like right at the base of the leaf
but then she'll just kind of finish her fade man she's got a really cool color to her
and then that was the euphoric from back in the day that was the cut i lost to the cesarean
unfortunately but yeah like this bubbly calyx is man like she just had this like
like i don't know like the only way i could describe it it was really my one of my first like
encounters with gauges work i was like this is just kind of like uh what i imagined cindy 99
like to originally be like just this beautiful sweet but it's got this pungent smell to it and
from a distance it's just like i don't even know how to explain it so it's just like you know how
you're like that's weed like i just smell like dank and then you get up on it and it's a completely
different smell it's like sweet with like this almost like it kind of would cut you with like
this this almost underline of sour but it wasn't like dominant at all it's very sweet but yeah that
was one that unfortunately we lost to that cesarean barrel it's like a really shitty peat moss thing
and we worked with a completely different group of people after that and but you know that's one
of those things you live and you learn like like jeff was saying like you just kind of figure things
out you figure life out and that was one of those cuts that that taught me life lessons
i think we all yeah we've gone through a lot of that man you just got to live and let live you
know and there's lots of new stuff to to find and create with you know that's that's the beauty of
this you know i mean it's it's like an artist's palette you know you just get your paints and if
you lose those paints get some more paints you know and just paint you know that's that's what
it's all about man are you guys breeding anything uh that's kind of more for for hash like it washes
well versus other stuff that's more for the flower market or constant or well constant hatches
contrary but um stuff that washes well i've always i've always said that all our plants that um all
gauge green can be considered like a dab plant or um you know just our our name of our modern
version of the word hash plant because basically from the very beginning some of our plants were
extracting you know in the 25 30 range like um like the grape stomper for example like that that
is a plant that will return and give back and it just spits whether you're talking about a butane
extraction or bubble hash and so everything we've faced and i would just say that's a testament to
the breeder and the selection and all the people that put in work like jeff and jojo rezo um over
the years to maintain that really high level of um quality that there's there are turps there's
flavor but there's also tremendous resin um we also breed for it so so i would say like
we've always bred for plants that were good for hash um traditionally if you look at the way
gauge green flowers look they um increase in resin size they um they all extract very well
and so that's something that we've always gone for and
i i think that there are certain crosses like right now uh one of the best yielders and one
of the the best uh i don't want to say best but one of one really popular hash plant um is the gmo
the the chem cookies it just makes a phenomenal bubble and rosin and or whatever and it it yields
and and it just doesn't happen to make the best looking plants but it and flower but it it works
as a you know so it's like you can say that that's you know some of the crosses that we're working
with um and down that line and shout out to mameko um for for producing that uh we just like
we have uh gmo lines and we're really um ecstatic about you know what the breath work and what the
high school sweetheart and what some of these um other males that we've had um crossed it with
can do to that but at the same time like if you just go down the list any one of our strains is
going to be amazing for a hash that's going to be my like that's that's kind of like the standard
for us got it
uh so a while ago and i told them i'd ask the question um the american one asked ask if they
still use the imploder water structure in their operations and then dirty michigan cordy said
is that the water metzel cleaner doohickey with the marbles inside kind of a little more
technological and then dirty accordion said it looks like some hip it seems like hippie science
uh so can you talk about that yeah we're all about our um alternative methods for enhancing life
with you may you know whether whether um so long as our intuition tells us that that there's
something there and i think jeff has been working with water for a long time and it started when he
discovered that you know the chloramine in the water was was uh affecting the organic soil and
that's kind of like i think a rabbit hole that we went down and just learning about how many
different types of water how water can be so drastically different how it can pick up energy
how it can um be full of toxins how it can you know change the way your garden performs and so
we've used uh the person who's so we use two different types we've gotten uh the um vortex
revitalizer which is a copper tube inline tube that attaches to your um home and basically you
have to get a plumber to install it and it puts all your plants through a vortex and that's
something that jeff found and it's uh aligns with the biodynamic uh practice of spinning your water
in multiple times in both directions and alternate in alternating directions which basically
um creates you know the bipolarity which is you know which allows your water to have more surface
tension or less surface tension and um it would say be more structured as the as the term is less
congealed um and so basically water from a pipe normally is you know clogged up is pressurized is
is not really flowing and moving like it would in a river or an ocean and so the revitalizers and
that sort of what some might consider hippie technology is simply a form of biomimicry is
trying to or seeking to add life to something that might not have as much life you know what
i mean in the sense that it's been piped and it's been um sitting in a reservoir or whatnot and so
the other device we use from country roots is um has the marbles we don't i don't use marbles i put
quartz crystals and i basically let the water run through the quartz crystals and then it goes
through a vortex and just through the vortex it's picking up oxygen it's breaking up the water
molecules and i think that it's all good i mean there's there's no real reason why somebody should
be afraid of alternative methods you know just because um it hasn't been studied or it doesn't
have like a um university backing it some you know some trust fund that or some foundation that
wants you to basically think a certain way um backing the research just because that doesn't
exist doesn't mean that that knowledge is um unsubstantial you know and uh so was so go ahead
i was gonna be like there's actually a german scientist i forget his name right now i'll have
to send you the stuff but he is studying the structured water in the vortex i was gonna bring
up structured water and someone in the chat mentioned the structured water uh but go ahead
but yeah i i forget what it is but he is going in depth of member uh water memory and so on so forth
i'll look it up and i'll send it so we can all post it but yes the they're definitely taking a
scientific approach to structured water nowadays right it all has to start somewhere you know it
starts with the witch doctor or the witch that's brewing the tea in her cauldron and spinning the
water in both directions and thinking like there's some reason for that and then to like where there's
it starts with somebody with some intuition is how i see it and then and then it it takes um
research and practice to prove it you know that it works but some of this stuff has been used for
thousands of years and um it's why argue with with our ancestors you know i mean the people that came
before us why argue with them why think that we we have to have like some kind of new technology
and so i mean we're all about going back to the old you know i think it's one of those things too
man like we're a bunch of weed growers like if anything we all had a different mindset and some
creative mentality to go do our own thing at some point so if you're not thinking outside of the box
somewhat then i think you need to get off instagram i guess right like it's funny man that you say that
like you guys were talking on i i listen to like every podcast like i'm a nerd right about weed so
like you guys at some point were talking about like using juices and things like that so i've
been ph in my water with like my personal grows with orange juice and grape juice from like
farms that i know are doing their own organic thing i'm like you know why not just try this
shit like we're just again a bunch of weed growers like just kind of like smoke some good
weed expand your mind and try something new even if it's in your grow or if it's just going outside
for 30 minutes and trying something different so like you know what you're saying man i think it's
like shitty that you guys get like a rap for just being creative and just kind of your own people
man so just on my side of it like i hope you don't let that shit get to you like you guys are some
cool dudes and i think you guys just breed good weed like that's the end of the day if anybody's
going to give you a hard time then you know at least just pop some of your fucking seeds right
i i take it as a compliment really i take it all as a compliment you know if if i if i do what i'm
doing to um you know which is i i feel that i'm i'm on this journey with something much larger
than myself and mike knows that too so if i have people that are bashing me and you know even
trying to take me down then i know that i'm on the right road you know because i can i know who's
doing it you know and and it's not they're just not friendly good people you know that's just the
nature of what this world is you know like i was trying to say before not there's a lot of
evil people here in this world and gauge green is all about taking a step you know above and being
on a higher plane in every sense of the word so you know to me you know you can bash me all you
want you know i'll i'll take that as um i'll turn that into positive energy and i'll go forward even
stronger than before believe me that's just what we do now 100 respect for that man like you know
you got to cut the grass to see the snakes and unfortunately a lot of the grass these days is
weed so you just get a lot of weird people just aren't stoked you know what i mean like rather
it's on their grow or their their insecurities themselves and you know you guys are at a place
now where they're gonna take it out on somebody and you know like you're at a place now where
people are like look at this guy like he's fucking killing it and they're both happy they they made
this move and they're doing their own thing so they've got to aim that somewhere you know like
well you want me to tell you the reality of the situation cam the thing is is that we're human
beings all right and we've all made mistakes in the past and you know the thing is like a real
person who who really wants to do good things will pick themselves up dust themselves off and
and say hey i'm not going to do that shit no more you know i'm gonna i'm gonna live with a purpose
and i'm gonna serve something better and i'm gonna give to others because giving is receiving
so you know people like that stand out you know and um that's just that's just who what we're all
about you know because we've we've had to pick ourselves up but there's never a question of
quitting nobody could make us quit that's just we're not quitters so and you know i hope i teach
people you know that you know we're here to help you not to hurt you you know so if you're on our
ass you know just kind of like open up your eyes and your ears but you might get something that you
will save your life you know really so that's my little deal yeah it's inspirational man you know
like at the end of the day you know like i'm a i'm a big hip-hop guy i think killer mike says
it the best he says you don't like me you know i guess i'll live somehow all right that's it
that's it you know life's too short you gotta live you can't be worried what people think of you
you know you really can't you just have to do the very best and you know it's and if i said that it
didn't hurt sometimes i'd be lying you know but that's mine man like for you and michael dude like
what do you guys think's next like you guys are just killing it man you guys got good genetics like
i i saw someone what tried to buy you guys out for like an insane amount of money recently or
something like that you know like you guys are just doing a great job what's in your mind to
do next like what are you guys thinking about like just keep making killer crosses or you guys
gonna stay in the states you guys still working with weirdos over in europe that are you know
trying to burn bridges well i i don't know man it's it's kind of like we have a lot of plans but
um we're just trying to get the word out and we're trying to do it in a quality way and to heal
people who who want what we have and mike has got the protocols out and um just you know the gauge
green protocols and um so there's just a lot of really positive quality things you know the
organic cup is going uh was really a success and we'd like to take those around and um you know
mike can elaborate on a lot of the things we're doing we're we're doing a lot of um design work on
the side and you know for our own branding and and uh mike actually does a lot of that you know he's
very creative and you know he's um the photographs he takes is really you know it's just on a higher
plane you know so and that's where we really aspire you know it's kind of a continuing
a continuing journey really just to keep that higher plane going
yeah so someone someone wanted to buy you guys out canada um so so peter i'm not sure if you're
familiar but in michigan here um we were raided uh three years ago in july i believe of um or
june or july of 2017 and um this uh this was when we were like at at our at a high point in our you
know um breeding this is we just had dropped the hammerhead the mendo breads and all this
really fire stuff um and uh we got raided and within i would say a few weeks i was offered
from an individual a hundred grand for our seat bank this is not the gauge green
company this is just our seat bank i was like uh nah you know what i mean like
i just not not not to you not not really and the guy ended up making his own and uh but like
a few months later jeff got terribly sick and he actually like had to go to the hospital and i was
like taking care of the farm and the garden and going back and forth it was this weird time
and i got a text message from this guy who was like hey um the same guy who wanted to buy the
seed bank for 100k he's like hey would you ever uh sell your company gauge green he's like like
for completely buy a complete buyout i was like yeah i was i was joking around i was like yeah you
came with like a billion dollars you know like i'm going for i'm going for like the top you know
what i mean and he's like what about 15 million 20 million i was like um hold on let me think
about that you know no like i told i talked to jeff i was like i mean i couldn't say no
right away without talking to jeff but he was like all fucked up and sick and not feeling good
and like probably would have been the perfect time to take 15 million dollars or 20 million dollars
or whatever just cashed out right that's i mean it actually sounds pretty good right now but like
but me and jeff like had a discussion and we were just like i mean um we were like no like we we
we're in this for the long run you know like i actually i'm going i want to make gauge green
a company that people remember forever i want to be in the history books like or the herstory books
or whatever like i want to be remembered i don't want to be remembered in a negative way
but like it's like we're not here to just back out and leave and and give away our stuff i mean like
can you imagine if like so anyways we said no within a few months we go to the high time show
and they're and we're like yeah we're gauge green they're like uh wait didn't you just check
hold on and then they're like wait you guys signed up late right we're like no we didn't sign up late
i signed up like three four months ago with you guys like we got a booth right in the right in the
middle and he's like they're like no you're out the at the edge and then so we got out put out
on the edge as we were walking through we see this sign that says gauge times cookies i'm like
what gauge times cookies and then like you know cookies knows all about us so instantly i just got
like i just had a bad feeling like i mean burner knows me like all these people know me and they
all have a reason not to like us and um so i do more research finds out they're applying for a
trademark gauge um they actually are backed by canopy growth they um which is you know the highest
market cap company um they ousted uh bruce lynn linton who is now uh from the ceo of canopy growth
and now he's going to be the ceo of h they're called gauge cannabis co which is a straight
knock of knock off of gauge green group um anybody who you know can't see the synonyms there
is blind and but we are opposing their trademark and their only argument actually i don't know if
i'm even allowed to talk about it but but my opinion i believe i believe that they may be
trying to say that we are illegal because we are not licensed and so anyways it's just this really
dark like entity they have um hired the world's like largest grossing law firm they are for in
no other and no other words to put it like like the illuminati you know what i mean like they
they it's like mtv all over again it's like um let me just let's just put on a fake axe deal
like just the whole burner thing you know what i mean and um basically if you if you look at the
brands they uh gauge is exclusively providing cookies in michigan and they offer six of the
seven brands or cookies one of the their and one brand is gauge it's basically a complete knockoff
they're trying to come here and take our name and this is um all just opinion this is not you know
like i i this is just how i feel it's too coincidental and i never said ever that they
canopy growth or we call them phage for fake gauge um i never said that phage offered us any money
that's been connected by other people um just through just through the happenstance or the
coincidence coincidence of how closely the situations you know the raid and then the offer
and then the fact that they so they were offering 15 million to us so it's just on the low end
they if you look at the news articles they are spending or at least the um canopy growth in the
gauge group they're spending 30 million in michigan so just a little bit more than what
they were going to spend to buy us out and um or double and they they're one of the most you know
heavily like licensed groups here and it's just all bad news like recently i read an article that
um green peaks innovations or whatever which is the same group that's trying to outlaw caregivers
here in michigan um is helping burner obtains florida license so um he's going to be like the
first minority person in florida to own something like that but it basically comes from canopy
growth how minority is that and so basically um it's uh this guy who used to work for gauge
cannabis reached out to me he's like yeah they know definitely know who you guys are but they
just think that they're corporate cannabis and they're going to take you guys out and that's
the end of the story um me and jeff represent something that's pure and wholesome and
i'd say they represent satan and that's the spiritual war that's been going on for
for ages and i think that um we're we are we are going to we're going to accomplish our goals
we're going to accomplish the the mission and um cam like you were saying what's the future
is that basically we want to transform all this parasitic energy all this dark energy
all this darkness into into wholesome beneficial you know healing energy we see the um the toxic
industrial complexes that run this plane and we we want to transform them into beneficial and
harmonic entities we want to we want everything to have a purpose we want to instill spirit and
soul into you know our friends and family and give them the truth so that they're no longer
misled by you know petrol-based chemical um patented medicine so that we can free the mind
so that we can free ourselves from enslavement for no other words and so that's where that's
where we're at and and we have um methods and knowledge that will truly free your mind
uh there's no there's no ifs ands or buts like if you truly tapped into what we are trying to
communicate your life will never be the same and it can't and this is only if you are truly
serious and intentional about what you're trying to accomplish um there's obviously a lot of people
who would like to silence us or who would like to downplay or discredit or censor what me and
Jeff have to offer and like Jeff says that's that's proof that we're on the right track
and Cam like you said we we broke all the rules when we became when we smoked weed
when we started growing weed we we dropped all the illusions we we we you know broke down the
the false notions that cannabis was anything but but the healing spirit and so that's what
me and Jeff seek to do in every aspect of our life of this world we we see um an illusion that
that needs to be broken down so that we can obtain heaven on earth and I know that's all like very up
in the clouds kind of talk but that's what we really seek to do is to um bring heaven down to
earth like like it's um our our main mission and so in everything we do whether it be our
future dispensaries or our message or our marketing our branding um or our outreach
the point and the goal is that we want to uplift society we want to create harmony we want humanity
to humanity to reach its full potential and we and yeah I mean I would say that's
that's the gist of it and that's killer man that's like that's truly inspiring I mean
like kind of on the back end of that with with you know the inspirational words it's like
so right now in Maryland like the way our med grows were set up it was like you had to only be
residentials like to get your to get your license and whatnot and in the past few years we kind of
found uh our only there's only two grows on our side of like the bridge like there's the whole
Baltimore DC side of everything of like our state the other side of the bridge is just slow like
we're all farmers we're just a bunch of lazy surfers basically that just grow corn and uh
man like burner moved in on the other the other grow that's on the side of the bridge the cookies
fam like kind of bought into a grow called kalta and like they they put out like a okay product
and stuff like that but like it's just such a bummer to hear that kind of stuff when you're
here like mixing your own soil like you know growing bacteria and fungus to fight these issues
that people are just spraying with like pesticides and things and then like out of nowhere someone
that's not in state that doesn't give a shit can just move in because they have the money it's
extremely frustrating and it's very hard to i'm gonna see the light at the end of the tunnel so
really like for you guys to say like hey man we just stuck our heads together we realized what
was important for us and what we think the real future is going to be and you just kept your head
down and dealt with it and you did it you know what i mean so that's really inspiring man like
it's like i hear the whole like move-in corporation thing it just kind of pisses me off because it's
funny like to easy talk about like the booth factories and the med program and stuff but like
we're the little guys in the program like i'm an underground like closet grower that started from
the day and it's like like a way different program is going on with what we're doing
compared to what's going over in this cookie like you know kind of thing it's very sad to see that
people that really give a shit and the people that have been there putting in the work are just
easily getting like kicked out by these guys it's just like man they just have the money and the
power right like you know again it's like we're a bunch of lazy corn growers like we don't have the
law firms to fight that stuff we don't have the like you know like we look at each other like wait
a minute like these guys aren't from maryland how did they get a license like there's not much that
we're going to do about that or fight it you know what i mean but so again very inspiring man like
that's super cool to hear that you guys are able to just be like yeah it's money but at the end of
the day we're doing what we do and that makes us happy man that's super important little bit but
so just quickly uh we we can wrap it on that and then a uh a last question from happy to grow
one uh but before i get to that question uh i'm gonna go eat the uh swordfish that my mom made
with uh some asparagus pesto and she was telling me that it is not as good cold as it was hot but
uh and then after that we have nicotine uh later tonight that's 8 p.m pacific 11 p.m eastern
plus five hours for london plus six hours for paris tomorrow um we have sol alba who's an ipm
expert ivan ruiz who's running a greenhouse up in uh like the salinas area and chris zelewski
from front range uh talking all sorts of uh pest pathogens and plants and then uh sunday
at 11 a.m pacific 2 p.m eastern we have james loud adam dunn and james bean uh talking history um
and some other stuff will probably be worked in there but the question from um happy to grow was
could you ask them about the strains archetype and prominence please i'm
running them now and don't know what to expect should he expect good things
that's that's the um that's the exciting part is not knowing what to expect if you do what to expect
then what's what's the point you know i mean i guess like you would just grow the clone but like
uh the point of these seeds is that every seed is going to be unique every seed is going to be
special but i can tell you some of the general things that you can expect is just incredible
incredible amounts of frost tricone turps um the uh the archetype being you know grateful breath
and the uh grape stomper og it's going to have just probably more frost than anything you've
ever seen before um if it leans to the grape stomper and if it's on the grateful breath side
it's going to be really dense it's going to be fuely it's going to have um nice you know
kush nose and and and flavor to it uh we expect the best of both worlds and um
forgot what the other strain was
uh sorry the other one was uh prominence yeah and jeff can tell you about prominence he just
did a run of that that was a recent drop cherry pie kush back cross and that um was like a 40
pack limited drop and um jeff has been growing that so you want to talk about it jeff
yeah i only had room to do like 20 seeds so i did those and i i actually found one really nice
male and two five two really nice females yet a lot of people are you know really in love with
they want me to keep growing the prominence number six but the male that i found is really
special that the whole uh dynamic is is really um getting me going so i i didn't have um too
much variation in the two females that i liked one was just uh better um in the flavor department
and it yielded a little bit more but that's not really a telling thing so uh like mike says you're
going to get a lot of um surprises but they're going to be good surprises and um you have my
word on that jeff do you think the uh fuel and the um the fuel side of the cpk gets passed on
into the prominence or is it more fruity uh no it's the it's the ones that i had was definitely
the cpk um very and you know with the terpenes and and even the rock hardness of the buds
but i let those um i let that plant go for a long time to stack and it was just really
there's a lot of similarities with the parent so yeah all right and with that i think we can
wrap it up so i can uh make my mom happy i haven't seen in a year actually just quickly so like as you
guys look forward because um you know uh scott reach was supposed to come on and i want to
reschedule that but you know he i think kind of known for breeding originally but then kind of
ventures out into you know different lines of business so as you guys look forward can you talk
about your vision for kind of where most of the revenue or the mix of revenue and business uh
for gauge green group is let's say a year or two from now are you making your money from breeding
or are you having a brand that's on the store shelves are you having retail operations are you
doing other stuff that's a great question like we've since we've i feel like we've uh
i want to say dominated but really been successful at seeds we've we want to translate that to every
aspect of cannabis which we've always you know focused on creating a craft and boutique model
for our flower our edibles anything we do is all 100 organic with the cleanest the highest
quality great inputs and so in the same way we uh you know create our seeds we we hope to produce
flower for everybody um so that involves getting licensed that involves uh strategic partnerships
to get gauge green into um onto the shelves and our our whole our vision is to have gauge green
boutiques throughout the world that provide the highest grade organic medicine to people that
that need it and we don't see that just like the organic cup was the is the one of the only organic
only focused events in the world so will our dispensary so will our um grows be solely focused
on producing the cleanest medicine so that's the vision and like i mean we we have a whole line of
products you know smokes edibles flowers we are um seeking to get into other industries other um
businesses like you said uh one of them being we have an apothecary open and so we are offering
herbs for people that want to pursue natural healing on their own or through an herbalist and
want to obtain the highest quality herbs the same ones that we have sourced and we have also created
a line of plant-based herbal nutrients herbs and mushroom products and that's something that we're
doing right now not sure how if that's something like we're going to be doing long term but
basically having our own apothecary creating formulations to enhance the health of people
pets and plants that's something that we've really been exploring ourselves and been tremendous
tremendously success successful in and so we want to share that with others as well and so we've
taken the measures to start introducing our herbs and different products to the public and uh yeah
one day we'll have a you'll be able to step into a gauge green boutique and have access to
knowledge um herbs flower cannabis and um other healing you know things that you can access that
are sourced from the highest grade um just like gauge green you know products are always meant to
be so and and just quickly cam who who do you want to talk to next oh geez man i just talked to
