[00:00.000 --> 00:03.240]  So let's talk sunlight and light.
[00:03.240 --> 00:04.080]  Right.
[00:04.080 --> 00:08.160]  OK, so what people sort of forget
[00:08.160 --> 00:12.440]  is that when the sunlight hits that plant, 50% to 60%
[00:12.440 --> 00:15.240]  of the photosynthetic energy is used
[00:15.240 --> 00:17.160]  not to produce the cannabis flower,
[00:17.160 --> 00:19.400]  not to produce the leaves or the stem,
[00:19.400 --> 00:23.680]  but to produce carbon exudates that drip out into the soil.
[00:23.680 --> 00:26.800]  So the quality of light has everything
[00:26.800 --> 00:29.880]  to do with the quality of the exudates.
[00:29.960 --> 00:32.760]  And the efficiency of the plant being able to produce
[00:32.760 --> 00:34.080]  those exudates.
[00:34.080 --> 00:37.680]  OK, those exudates are what attract the bacteria
[00:37.680 --> 00:39.280]  and the fungi to feed the plants,
[00:39.280 --> 00:41.640]  you know, blah, blah, blah, teeming with microbes.
[00:41.640 --> 00:45.400]  If you have bad light, then you are not
[00:45.400 --> 00:48.640]  impacting the plant properly, A.
[00:48.640 --> 00:52.320]  B, some of these microbes are sensitive to light.
[00:52.320 --> 00:55.560]  Some of these microbes are photosynthetic.
[00:55.560 --> 00:57.600]  Some of these, you know, so that light
[00:57.600 --> 00:59.480]  has an impact on them as well.
[01:00.080 --> 01:02.040]  And the other members of the soil food web
[01:02.040 --> 01:04.800]  are impacted by the light in similar ways,
[01:04.800 --> 01:07.880]  and they in turn have impacts on the microbes which end up.
[01:07.880 --> 01:10.160]  So the whole thing cascades as a result
[01:10.160 --> 01:12.440]  of the sun hitting that plant.
[01:12.440 --> 01:17.440]  Now if you use an LED that's missing green wavelength,
[01:18.320 --> 01:20.560]  because most of them are, they don't need any green.
[01:20.560 --> 01:21.640]  Well, the reason why they say that
[01:21.640 --> 01:23.600]  is because they can't produce it.
[01:23.600 --> 01:25.640]  Yeah, so it's missing the green wavelength.
[01:25.680 --> 01:29.720]  Well, then, you know, that means that deep down in that leaf
[01:29.720 --> 01:31.680]  there are chloroplasts that aren't operating
[01:31.680 --> 01:33.040]  the way they're supposed to.
[01:33.040 --> 01:34.600]  Yeah, the ones on the top are,
[01:34.600 --> 01:36.800]  but that green stuff is a, that's a wave,
[01:36.800 --> 01:38.920]  and it goes into the plant,
[01:38.920 --> 01:41.680]  and it does stuff way down deep, you know.
[01:41.680 --> 01:44.700]  And so if you're missing that, you got a problem.
[01:45.760 --> 01:48.360]  And that's why I like the plasma lamp,
[01:48.360 --> 01:51.520]  because it was invented specifically
[01:51.520 --> 01:54.000]  to mimic the sun's spectrum.
[01:54.840 --> 01:56.520]  You say it sounds like a process
[01:56.520 --> 01:58.000]  of sitting there for thousands of years
[01:58.000 --> 02:00.040]  on those Afdani Hills.
[02:00.040 --> 02:02.160]  Well, it's not just, yeah, for everything,
[02:02.160 --> 02:05.340]  and not just the plants, but us as well.
[02:05.340 --> 02:08.000]  I mean, you know, we react to sunlight.
[02:08.000 --> 02:10.080]  You know, I always think about people
[02:10.080 --> 02:12.280]  that are out there under the indoor grow,
[02:12.280 --> 02:14.280]  you know, working under the LEDs,
[02:14.280 --> 02:16.580]  and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, you know.
[02:18.400 --> 02:20.200]  By plasma, you mean HID lighting?
[02:20.200 --> 02:22.900]  No, these are called a plasma light.
[02:22.900 --> 02:24.420]  It's just like a plasma light.
[02:24.420 --> 02:26.380]  You know, there's a special gas on the ends.
[02:26.380 --> 02:29.540]  These are really unbelievable, little teeny light.
[02:29.540 --> 02:32.180]  One light replaces five or six of these,
[02:32.180 --> 02:34.980]  you know, big, you know, gravita-type lights.
[02:34.980 --> 02:37.300]  What I like about this plasma light is,
[02:37.300 --> 02:40.420]  talk about terroir, let's assume you wanna grow
[02:40.420 --> 02:43.020]  Durban poison in Portland, Oregon, you know,
[02:43.020 --> 02:44.700]  or Anchorage, Alaska.
[02:44.700 --> 02:48.360]  Well, now we can dial in the exact sunlight.
[02:49.260 --> 02:52.580]  We can get the exact wavelength from Durban, Africa,
[02:53.260 --> 02:56.620]  latitude, longitude, dial it in on this plasma lamp,
[02:56.620 --> 02:59.620]  and give it that, and then get the soil from Durban,
[02:59.620 --> 03:02.260]  get the sea from Durban, bingo.
[03:02.260 --> 03:03.940]  Plasma lights have been around for a while.
[03:03.940 --> 03:06.100]  And you used to have to have a, you know,
[03:06.100 --> 03:10.580]  a one for flowering, one for bed, no, not with this one.
[03:10.580 --> 03:12.540]  This, the guy is a Swiss guy, he invented,
[03:12.540 --> 03:14.240]  I just met him this weekend,
[03:14.240 --> 03:18.180]  and his goal was to match the sun.
[03:18.180 --> 03:21.180]  So now, when you test a solar panel,
[03:21.180 --> 03:24.060]  you use this light to test the solar panel.
[03:24.060 --> 03:25.580]  You don't have to use the sun.
[03:25.580 --> 03:27.060]  You can test it in the factory.
[03:27.060 --> 03:29.980]  There's nothing else I know that does that, period.
[03:29.980 --> 03:31.740]  Now, you know, these are not cheap lights,
[03:31.740 --> 03:33.260]  but the efficiency is unbelievable.
[03:33.260 --> 03:36.900]  They last two, three, 400,000 hours,
[03:36.900 --> 03:38.980]  and they use no wattage.
[03:38.980 --> 03:41.020]  As far as I know, like in Massachusetts,
[03:41.020 --> 03:45.300]  this is a, oh my God, and no heat.
[03:45.300 --> 03:46.700]  And no heat.
[03:46.700 --> 03:47.540]  It's unbelievable.
[03:47.540 --> 03:49.500]  And they mimic the sun, but the sun has heat.
[03:49.500 --> 03:51.860]  Well, they mimic the sun, but I mean, you know,
[03:51.860 --> 03:53.660]  you'd have to be inside it to get the heat.
[03:53.660 --> 03:55.020]  The other thing about it is,
[03:55.020 --> 03:58.060]  is that the form factor can be changed,
[03:58.060 --> 04:00.260]  so that you can, you know, you can make it,
[04:00.260 --> 04:03.860]  you can, depending, the box is, you know, little,
[04:03.860 --> 04:07.020]  but you can make it long, or you can make it fat.
[04:07.020 --> 04:09.020]  This light is definitely patented.
[04:09.020 --> 04:09.860]  It's patented.
[04:09.860 --> 04:10.680]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[04:10.680 --> 04:12.420]  It's patented and it's being used,
[04:12.420 --> 04:14.700]  and it's being tested, it's on the market.
[04:14.700 --> 04:15.660]  It is on the market.
[04:15.660 --> 04:18.020]  It's being used for the film industry.
[04:18.660 --> 04:19.740]  Just as a light.
[04:19.740 --> 04:24.660]  It's being used, growers, growers are using them.
[04:24.660 --> 04:27.500]  Hospitals are testing them because of the mental,
[04:28.540 --> 04:32.980]  it has, and hotels and, you know, venues,
[04:32.980 --> 04:35.260]  because you feel good under sunlight.
[04:35.260 --> 04:39.140]  So, so, not headlights yet.
[04:39.140 --> 04:40.940]  And what I can't get them to do yet,
[04:40.940 --> 04:42.260]  but they're working on it,
[04:42.260 --> 04:45.500]  is to make a little teeny marble-sized one
[04:45.500 --> 04:48.980]  for my, you know, six by four grow tent.
[04:48.980 --> 04:50.500]  That's what we really want.
[04:50.500 --> 04:52.780]  It's the only light I know that I would ever use
[04:52.780 --> 04:57.780]  in Massachusetts, which has a wattage, you know, restriction.
