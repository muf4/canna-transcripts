[00:00.000 --> 00:02.400]  It's funny, my two-year-old is nailing it.
[00:02.400 --> 00:06.680]  Like she said football and I like turned around
[00:06.680 --> 00:08.880]  and it was actually like football players.
[00:08.880 --> 00:10.640]  And then like she said basketball
[00:10.640 --> 00:12.160]  and I turned around again and I was like,
[00:12.160 --> 00:14.540]  holy shit, you're two years old.
[00:14.540 --> 00:15.980]  My mind is blown.
[00:17.080 --> 00:22.080]  All right, we are, I think we're live.
[00:22.440 --> 00:24.120]  All right, I'm not seeing.
[00:25.120 --> 00:25.960]  Let's see.
[00:30.340 --> 00:33.180]  Maybe a refresh.
[00:36.380 --> 00:37.780]  Yep, five watching.
[00:37.780 --> 00:41.780]  Yeah, people are starting to, hello world.
[00:41.780 --> 00:42.620]  Let's see.
[00:44.020 --> 00:46.380]  Can you hear us mumbling and babbling?
[00:48.740 --> 00:51.020]  Yep, all right.
[00:53.620 --> 00:55.340]  So Mia, take it away.
[00:55.340 --> 00:57.620]  As I said, before we went live,
[00:58.580 --> 01:01.020]  watching the final couple of minutes of the Celtics game.
[01:01.020 --> 01:02.680]  So I'll be quiet for a minute.
[01:04.300 --> 01:09.060]  Yes, we've been informed that Peter is very tired.
[01:09.060 --> 01:12.140]  He's been traveling a lot the last 24 hours
[01:12.140 --> 01:14.220]  and I won't be able to see your comments for a bit
[01:14.220 --> 01:16.900]  because it always takes me a couple of refreshes.
[01:16.900 --> 01:20.460]  But joining us today is, I guess he goes by Nikiti.
[01:20.460 --> 01:21.900]  You may probably know him through Instagram
[01:21.900 --> 01:22.980]  of Essential Extracts.
[01:22.980 --> 01:24.820]  Do you want to say hello?
[01:24.820 --> 01:26.140]  Greetings.
[01:26.140 --> 01:28.220]  Thank you guys for having me.
[01:28.220 --> 01:30.060]  Appreciate y'all taking the time.
[01:32.960 --> 01:35.080]  I wish I could see everybody's comments
[01:35.080 --> 01:37.120]  but I'm still refreshing in a small view.
[01:38.400 --> 01:39.360]  That's all right.
[01:40.240 --> 01:41.200]  Oh, here we go.
[01:41.200 --> 01:42.480]  Here we go.
[01:42.480 --> 01:43.320]  One second.
[01:48.840 --> 01:50.360]  Hi, Ohio.
[01:50.360 --> 01:51.200]  What's up?
[01:51.200 --> 01:52.920]  Actually, I feel like that's a good place to start,
[01:52.920 --> 01:55.680]  but for those of you who don't know,
[01:55.720 --> 01:57.600]  Nikiti is a solventless pioneer.
[01:57.600 --> 02:00.280]  And do you want to introduce yourself
[02:00.280 --> 02:02.960]  to anybody who might not be familiar with your work?
[02:04.320 --> 02:05.160]  Sure.
[02:05.160 --> 02:09.560]  Yeah, so my name is Nick, also known as Nikiti.
[02:11.280 --> 02:13.160]  Either one works.
[02:13.160 --> 02:15.400]  That name Nikiti, people oftentimes ask me
[02:15.400 --> 02:17.520]  where that name came from.
[02:17.520 --> 02:21.280]  And it came from me, my DJ name.
[02:21.280 --> 02:24.000]  And a lot of that was influenced
[02:24.000 --> 02:28.880]  by a reggae sound system crew out of the Bay Area
[02:28.880 --> 02:30.760]  called Jaw Warrior Shelter.
[02:30.760 --> 02:32.800]  And a gentleman by the name of Rocker T
[02:34.360 --> 02:37.920]  is one of the main hosts and DJs of Jaw Warrior Shelter.
[02:37.920 --> 02:41.000]  And he had a major influence on my life
[02:41.000 --> 02:43.160]  and in that name, Nikiti.
[02:43.160 --> 02:48.080]  And I really started as a DJ and promoting myself
[02:48.080 --> 02:50.560]  as a DJ on the streets with flyers.
[02:50.560 --> 02:53.600]  And that really taught me a lot about how to promote myself
[02:53.600 --> 02:57.720]  as a hash maker in the professional business world.
[02:57.720 --> 02:58.720]  So that's really who I am.
[02:58.720 --> 03:01.760]  I'm a DJ, I'm a hash maker, I'm a teacher,
[03:01.760 --> 03:04.280]  I'm a consultant, a host.
[03:07.000 --> 03:09.880]  Just quickly, I think I saw a quote
[03:09.880 --> 03:11.800]  on someone's Instagram feed recently,
[03:11.800 --> 03:14.400]  which is like a drug dealer knows how to sell drugs,
[03:14.400 --> 03:16.240]  a hustler knows how to sell anything.
[03:17.920 --> 03:18.960]  Yeah, I was going to say,
[03:18.960 --> 03:23.960]  it sounds like that was an introduction to the grind
[03:24.240 --> 03:27.600]  more than any particular product or anything.
[03:27.600 --> 03:31.760]  Well, yeah, I mean, it taught me how to work
[03:31.760 --> 03:35.640]  on a street level, how to promote myself
[03:35.640 --> 03:37.720]  from the ground up, really,
[03:37.720 --> 03:39.360]  from passing out flyers in the club,
[03:39.360 --> 03:41.160]  passing out flyers on cars,
[03:42.480 --> 03:45.440]  to now utilizing these digital platforms.
[03:45.440 --> 03:46.960]  I was the kid that was out there skateboarding
[03:46.960 --> 03:49.440]  every single day, and I was against all my friends
[03:49.440 --> 03:51.120]  that were on MySpace and shit.
[03:51.120 --> 03:52.240]  I was making fun of them, like,
[03:52.240 --> 03:53.520]  what are y'all doing with your life?
[03:53.520 --> 03:54.480]  Why are you on this shit?
[03:54.480 --> 03:57.640]  Get out and skateboard and see some sun.
[03:57.640 --> 04:02.160]  But then as I became a DJ, I really saw the value
[04:02.160 --> 04:07.160]  of being able to promote myself via social media.
[04:09.120 --> 04:11.360]  And just kind of learned from there
[04:11.360 --> 04:13.920]  and continued to grow my brand.
[04:13.920 --> 04:15.920]  You mentioned Essential Extracts,
[04:16.320 --> 04:18.400]  and blessed to still keep pushing my brand
[04:18.400 --> 04:21.600]  and expanding into different states right now as we speak.
[04:21.600 --> 04:23.960]  My head's a little spinning, to be completely honest.
[04:23.960 --> 04:26.120]  I have so many launches going on right now,
[04:27.600 --> 04:29.160]  just lots of movements happening,
[04:29.160 --> 04:32.760]  but super blessed to stay busy in this time.
[04:32.760 --> 04:34.840]  Yeah, I was going to say, expanding into different states,
[04:34.840 --> 04:39.560]  I wanted to ask, where do you think the next big place is?
[04:39.560 --> 04:41.560]  Because you've done things in Missouri,
[04:41.560 --> 04:44.040]  Denver, like Canada, everywhere.
[04:45.000 --> 04:48.560]  Yeah, and I'm still trying to do bigger things
[04:48.560 --> 04:49.840]  in places like Canada.
[04:49.840 --> 04:52.760]  I think Canada's a very open market.
[04:52.760 --> 04:54.560]  We've done some classes out there.
[04:54.560 --> 04:56.600]  We did a cool little retreat out there,
[04:56.600 --> 04:58.520]  big up Gastown's Dave
[04:58.520 --> 05:02.280]  and that beautiful, cool little resort in Tofino, Canada.
[05:02.280 --> 05:05.560]  I didn't think Canada was cool until I visited Tofino.
[05:05.560 --> 05:07.400]  That place is unlike any other.
[05:07.400 --> 05:08.920]  I was fishing for salmon.
[05:08.920 --> 05:11.920]  At the same time, I was seeing bald eagles fly over my head
[05:11.920 --> 05:14.520]  and catching waves earlier in the morning.
[05:14.520 --> 05:16.200]  You can surf, fish.
[05:17.400 --> 05:19.600]  It was a magical place.
[05:19.600 --> 05:22.240]  I definitely want to do some more work out in Canada.
[05:23.440 --> 05:27.760]  I've been focusing a little bit on South America,
[05:28.680 --> 05:31.280]  Uruguay, Brazil.
[05:31.280 --> 05:34.080]  There's a lot of things happening right now down there.
[05:34.080 --> 05:36.680]  And although it's not fully regulated yet,
[05:36.680 --> 05:38.640]  there's some movements that we can make right now,
[05:38.640 --> 05:41.040]  some initial movements.
[05:42.560 --> 05:43.600]  Wow, Uruguay.
[05:43.600 --> 05:46.360]  I had a similar, not in Canada,
[05:46.360 --> 05:49.520]  but I had a similar experience in Alaska
[05:49.520 --> 05:54.360]  where I saw salmon and I saw bald eagles eating salmon
[05:54.360 --> 05:56.480]  that were like, gutted and stuff.
[05:56.480 --> 06:00.400]  It was the most metal thing
[06:00.400 --> 06:03.360]  my seven-year-old self had ever beheld.
[06:05.120 --> 06:06.400]  But we don't have, like, you know,
[06:06.400 --> 06:09.120]  bald eagles are extinct out here, you know,
[06:09.120 --> 06:10.280]  in the United States.
[06:10.320 --> 06:14.000]  But they're like seagulls out there in Canada,
[06:14.000 --> 06:15.800]  in Alaska, you know?
[06:15.800 --> 06:16.640]  I don't know.
[06:16.640 --> 06:17.480]  My mind was opened.
[06:17.480 --> 06:20.720]  I had a little bit more of a closed mind towards Canada,
[06:20.720 --> 06:23.040]  to be completely honest with you guys.
[06:23.040 --> 06:26.040]  I had tried to go up to Canada back,
[06:26.040 --> 06:28.040]  I don't know, 10 years ago or so,
[06:28.040 --> 06:30.800]  after a DJ gig in Bellingham, Washington.
[06:31.880 --> 06:34.080]  Me and some buddies tried to continue going up
[06:34.080 --> 06:36.000]  to play another gig and they didn't let me through.
[06:36.000 --> 06:38.080]  We, you know, it was a car that smelled like weed
[06:38.080 --> 06:40.600]  and we were a bunch of dreadlocked kids
[06:40.600 --> 06:41.760]  going to play a reggae gig.
[06:41.760 --> 06:43.080]  So they just didn't let me in.
[06:43.080 --> 06:45.800]  And so I was just like, I don't know,
[06:45.800 --> 06:49.320]  a little wary of Canada for a long time.
[06:49.320 --> 06:52.560]  But in the last 10 years,
[06:52.560 --> 06:54.120]  there's been some cool movements out there
[06:54.120 --> 06:56.640]  and I'd love to do some work out there in Canada.
[06:57.840 --> 07:00.240]  Yeah, it seems like you have a story
[07:00.240 --> 07:02.560]  about all of the different old days.
[07:02.560 --> 07:05.200]  I love what you were saying about earwax,
[07:05.240 --> 07:09.080]  or was that the hot consistency in like 2008?
[07:09.080 --> 07:09.920]  Yeah.
[07:09.920 --> 07:12.000]  And how it was all been with community.
[07:12.000 --> 07:13.120]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.
[07:13.120 --> 07:16.800]  Earwax was kind of what started it all in all reality.
[07:18.000 --> 07:19.960]  You know, there was bubble hash before that,
[07:19.960 --> 07:22.960]  there was isolator even before bubble hash.
[07:23.840 --> 07:27.840]  Before that, there was charis, which is hand rubbed in India.
[07:27.840 --> 07:29.400]  There's Moroccan dry sift.
[07:29.400 --> 07:31.000]  You know, there's a lot of different methods
[07:31.000 --> 07:32.440]  that came before.
[07:32.480 --> 07:36.200]  And I in no way have created any methodology.
[07:37.320 --> 07:42.320]  I've just really done a lot of research and development
[07:42.760 --> 07:46.840]  to slightly change variables and control variables,
[07:46.840 --> 07:48.080]  control my environment,
[07:48.080 --> 07:49.520]  and just do things slightly differently
[07:49.520 --> 07:51.360]  than what we had seen in the past.
[07:52.200 --> 07:57.200]  And when butane earwax came about in like 2005 to 2009,
[07:59.080 --> 08:01.400]  I was making it myself on my back porch
[08:01.400 --> 08:03.080]  in Boulder, Colorado, you know,
[08:03.080 --> 08:05.760]  fucking around with some machinery
[08:05.760 --> 08:07.760]  or some test tube looking thing
[08:07.760 --> 08:10.440]  I bought off the back of high times, you know.
[08:10.440 --> 08:13.920]  And this was before a lot of people were doing this,
[08:13.920 --> 08:15.560]  this was before closed loops.
[08:16.640 --> 08:21.640]  And I just, I felt like there was something more
[08:22.400 --> 08:25.480]  that I needed to learn about this product
[08:25.480 --> 08:27.040]  before I pushed it out there.
[08:27.080 --> 08:31.440]  I traveled to Amsterdam in like 2004.
[08:32.400 --> 08:34.640]  And then again, I think in 2005, 2006,
[08:34.640 --> 08:36.920]  when this started erupting,
[08:36.920 --> 08:40.720]  and there was only one place that was willing to share
[08:40.720 --> 08:43.800]  some of this knowledge on the test results
[08:43.800 --> 08:47.920]  from this butane extract or what they were calling,
[08:47.920 --> 08:48.760]  what was it?
[08:49.640 --> 08:52.720]  It was honey oil was another term that was used back then.
[08:53.560 --> 08:54.760]  Jelly.
[08:54.760 --> 08:57.040]  Jelly was kind of a way that people were getting away
[08:57.040 --> 08:58.360]  with it back in Amsterdam
[08:58.360 --> 09:01.880]  because Amsterdam had actually outlawed butane hash oil,
[09:01.880 --> 09:03.880]  but then there were people mixing butane
[09:03.880 --> 09:06.080]  with bubble hash or with isolator.
[09:06.080 --> 09:08.440]  And that was where that term jelly came from.
[09:08.440 --> 09:10.240]  So we saw a lot of jelly on the shelf
[09:10.240 --> 09:15.240]  in like 2004 in Amsterdam, in 2005 and later on.
[09:16.840 --> 09:18.320]  And there was the Bluebird Cafe
[09:18.320 --> 09:20.680]  and they were willing to share some of this,
[09:20.680 --> 09:24.000]  these COAs, these analysis, the test results.
[09:24.800 --> 09:27.400]  And they were showing me all kinds of heavy metals
[09:27.400 --> 09:31.720]  and pentane and isobutane and all of this stuff
[09:31.720 --> 09:33.720]  that I was like, whoa, this isn't what I wanna put
[09:33.720 --> 09:36.320]  in my system or what I wanna promote.
[09:36.320 --> 09:38.680]  And so, sorry, this is a long winded story,
[09:38.680 --> 09:41.200]  but my goal was to then make something
[09:41.200 --> 09:42.720]  that looked like this honey oil
[09:42.720 --> 09:45.040]  or that looked like this earwax consistency,
[09:45.040 --> 09:46.640]  but without the butane.
[09:46.640 --> 09:50.400]  And so we created,
[09:50.400 --> 09:52.760]  one of the first terms to really hit
[09:52.800 --> 09:55.200]  was a term called solventless wax
[09:55.200 --> 09:58.760]  because we recreated the look,
[09:58.760 --> 10:03.760]  the dab ability and the consistency of earwax,
[10:04.560 --> 10:05.720]  of butane earwax,
[10:05.720 --> 10:08.640]  but without the use of chemical solvents.
[10:08.640 --> 10:11.440]  And kind of since then, that's been our goal.
[10:11.440 --> 10:15.760]  When shatter was popular, we recreated solventless shatter.
[10:15.760 --> 10:18.360]  Now this wet batter consistency,
[10:18.360 --> 10:21.360]  some of the more, the diamond consistencies,
[10:21.360 --> 10:24.320]  these consistencies we've now been able to recreate
[10:24.320 --> 10:26.040]  on a mechanical level
[10:26.040 --> 10:28.240]  without the use of any chemical solvents.
[10:28.240 --> 10:31.240]  And that's kind of what our goal has been since day one
[10:31.240 --> 10:33.000]  and what we continue to strive to do.
[10:33.000 --> 10:35.560]  And now at this point, it's kind of crazy
[10:35.560 --> 10:37.480]  because we're not now recreating
[10:37.480 --> 10:40.360]  what the solvent guys are creating
[10:40.360 --> 10:42.360]  or the hydrocarbon extractors.
[10:42.360 --> 10:43.920]  We're just kind of,
[10:43.920 --> 10:45.800]  people are starting to do their own thing
[10:45.800 --> 10:49.280]  with the new pressure tech and different consistencies.
[10:49.280 --> 10:50.600]  And it's just cool to see.
[10:51.520 --> 10:53.800]  Where it's gone, where it's coming.
[10:53.800 --> 10:54.720]  Awesome.
[10:54.720 --> 10:58.240]  Do you see, I think that it's great
[10:58.240 --> 11:01.240]  that basically mechanical and solventless,
[11:01.240 --> 11:03.880]  the community, the innovators are right there
[11:03.880 --> 11:07.320]  along with whatever consistency is hot on the market
[11:07.320 --> 11:10.200]  and being able to mimic it in a healthier way.
[11:10.200 --> 11:14.600]  But do you see the, do you see yourself or the community
[11:14.600 --> 11:17.000]  or have you seen examples of it,
[11:17.000 --> 11:20.000]  of solventless methods sort of striking out on their own
[11:20.000 --> 11:23.240]  and making a consistency popular before anyone else?
[11:26.480 --> 11:30.720]  Well, sorry, striking out on its own?
[11:30.720 --> 11:31.560]  What do you mean by that?
[11:31.560 --> 11:34.880]  Yeah, see, basically I'm saying that it sounds like-
[11:37.080 --> 11:41.080]  It was always keeping up with the BHO world
[11:41.080 --> 11:44.560]  and matching them consistency for consistency.
[11:44.560 --> 11:48.240]  Do you see solventless charging ahead and having the BHO?
[11:48.240 --> 11:49.760]  Like, oh fuck, how'd they do that?
[11:50.520 --> 11:54.160]  I don't know if there's too many more consistencies
[11:55.160 --> 11:57.800]  that Rosin has created.
[11:57.800 --> 12:00.400]  Cause at this point I'm actually seeing like CRC
[12:00.400 --> 12:02.880]  being sold as Rosin and things like that.
[12:02.880 --> 12:05.640]  It's almost hard for a lot of us, even me,
[12:05.640 --> 12:07.920]  to tell just from looking at these products now,
[12:07.920 --> 12:12.920]  whether it is Rosin or whether it's with hydrocarbon.
[12:13.120 --> 12:18.120]  But on that similar note, we saw the diamond in sauce
[12:19.800 --> 12:24.360]  consistency with hydrocarbons, what, two, three years ago,
[12:24.360 --> 12:27.640]  that product was retailing for $100 a gram, right?
[12:27.640 --> 12:30.600]  On the legacy market,
[12:30.600 --> 12:33.160]  I'll focus on the legacy market right now.
[12:33.160 --> 12:36.000]  That product was retailing for $100 a gram
[12:36.000 --> 12:38.640]  on the legacy market for that, you know,
[12:40.800 --> 12:43.120]  the diamond baron style product
[12:43.120 --> 12:45.240]  with the diamonds in the sauce.
[12:46.200 --> 12:49.360]  We were able to recreate that type of consistency.
[12:49.360 --> 12:51.640]  But now two, three years later,
[12:51.640 --> 12:52.960]  we're seeing that product,
[12:52.960 --> 12:55.760]  that hydrocarbon diamonds in sauce
[12:55.760 --> 12:59.240]  retailing for like $50, almost cut in half.
[12:59.240 --> 13:01.640]  And we're seeing that Rosin product
[13:01.640 --> 13:06.160]  retailing for that 75 to a hundred dollar range, you know,
[13:06.160 --> 13:08.440]  and obviously people are seeing it, you know, cheaper
[13:08.440 --> 13:10.000]  if you've got some good connections
[13:10.000 --> 13:11.760]  or you're making it yourself.
[13:11.760 --> 13:14.720]  But I'm even seeing on the license side,
[13:15.080 --> 13:18.840]  that product going upwards of 130, $140 a gram for Rosin.
[13:20.080 --> 13:23.320]  So it's definitely something that's gotten
[13:23.320 --> 13:25.520]  more into the people's minds.
[13:25.520 --> 13:27.800]  We've saturated the market further.
[13:27.800 --> 13:31.240]  We're actually hitting the BDS, you know.
[13:31.240 --> 13:34.400]  So big up all those other Rosin producers right now
[13:34.400 --> 13:35.800]  that are pushing the boundaries
[13:35.800 --> 13:37.120]  of what we thought was possible.
[13:37.120 --> 13:38.960]  You know, when I first started making Rosin,
[13:38.960 --> 13:40.880]  we were probably less than 3%
[13:40.880 --> 13:42.920]  of the concentrate market in Colorado.
[13:42.920 --> 13:44.360]  Butane was still crushing.
[13:45.000 --> 13:47.240]  And we're slowly, gradually getting higher.
[13:47.240 --> 13:48.560]  You know, the solventless
[13:48.560 --> 13:51.360]  or mechanical separated products are, you know,
[13:51.360 --> 13:54.120]  in some markets like California are hitting, you know,
[13:54.120 --> 13:58.160]  numbers like 30, 40% of the concentrate market right now,
[13:58.160 --> 14:02.560]  which is pretty insane considering we started at 3% or less.
[14:03.400 --> 14:06.880]  You know, if that's medical or recreational or both?
[14:06.880 --> 14:08.720]  You know, I haven't broken it down yet.
[14:08.720 --> 14:11.440]  I haven't gotten too far into the analytics.
[14:11.440 --> 14:13.120]  I was just looking over the BDS
[14:13.120 --> 14:16.240]  and looking at some of the bigger names
[14:16.240 --> 14:17.320]  that are on that list.
[14:17.320 --> 14:20.800]  And knowing whether that product was solventless
[14:20.800 --> 14:24.200]  or hydrocarbon, you know, it's pretty cool to see.
[14:25.080 --> 14:27.680]  Just on being, having Rosin on that first sheet,
[14:27.680 --> 14:29.640]  you know, in general.
[14:29.640 --> 14:30.960]  Yeah, absolutely.
[14:32.240 --> 14:37.240]  On BDS, we could actually pull them on
[14:37.320 --> 14:39.200]  to give us our stats.
[14:39.200 --> 14:41.960]  But do you know what some of the biggest brands are
[14:41.960 --> 14:46.320]  in kind of those two markets, Colorado, California?
[14:48.120 --> 14:50.320]  In the regulated markets.
[14:50.320 --> 14:52.280]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[14:52.280 --> 14:54.600]  710 Labs is one of the great examples.
[14:54.600 --> 14:56.080]  They're crushing in California's market
[14:56.080 --> 14:57.720]  and Colorado's market.
[14:57.720 --> 14:59.080]  They're good friends of mine.
[14:59.080 --> 15:00.960]  I'm super stoked to where the, you know,
[15:00.960 --> 15:02.080]  see where they're come.
[15:03.000 --> 15:04.920]  A lot of their employees actually worked for me
[15:04.920 --> 15:05.800]  at Essential.
[15:06.960 --> 15:08.680]  So it's all family at this point.
[15:09.680 --> 15:11.280]  Yeah, they're definitely,
[15:12.280 --> 15:15.240]  they're definitely dominating a lot of the shelf space.
[15:15.240 --> 15:16.680]  And also a lot of the,
[15:16.680 --> 15:19.280]  it's rare to see a brand dominate
[15:19.280 --> 15:20.520]  both a lot of shelf space
[15:20.520 --> 15:23.480]  and a lot of like parts and minds of connoisseurs.
[15:23.480 --> 15:26.200]  And 710 Lab definitely pulls that off
[15:26.200 --> 15:28.120]  in Southern California.
[15:29.200 --> 15:30.840]  Yeah, no, and in Colorado.
[15:30.840 --> 15:32.240]  Big up my brethren, Brad.
[15:33.240 --> 15:34.520]  And all my family over there.
[15:34.520 --> 15:36.920]  Fuck, Danny C, Emily.
[15:37.320 --> 15:39.880]  I just, I've got a lot of people at 710.
[15:41.160 --> 15:43.040]  You know, and me and Brad to bring it back,
[15:43.040 --> 15:44.480]  I've probably mentioned this before.
[15:44.480 --> 15:46.200]  You guys might not have, or might've heard this,
[15:46.200 --> 15:49.120]  but me and Brad from 710 Labs
[15:49.120 --> 15:51.560]  and Kyle of Field Extracts.
[15:52.640 --> 15:54.600]  Kyle's done a lot of other things.
[15:54.600 --> 15:57.600]  But we all collaborated back in like what, 2012?
[15:58.880 --> 16:00.120]  And that's kind of when I, you know,
[16:00.120 --> 16:01.480]  started really pushing to them like,
[16:01.480 --> 16:03.120]  yo, you guys should get into solvenless
[16:03.120 --> 16:05.080]  because they were both hydrocarbon guys.
[16:05.200 --> 16:06.560]  And we did a collaboration together.
[16:06.560 --> 16:07.960]  We won a cup in LA.
[16:07.960 --> 16:10.680]  Since then, I've even won a cup with Field Extracts,
[16:10.680 --> 16:15.680]  you know, in Sacramento just last year, 2019.
[16:17.880 --> 16:20.680]  So, you know, they should be at top.
[16:20.680 --> 16:21.640]  I like what they're doing.
[16:21.640 --> 16:23.880]  I love all the education that they're spreading.
[16:23.880 --> 16:26.680]  You know, a lot of that came from, you know,
[16:26.680 --> 16:29.120]  oral tradition of me preaching to these kids
[16:29.120 --> 16:30.520]  over years and years and years
[16:30.520 --> 16:32.640]  over the last two decades almost.
[16:32.760 --> 16:34.000]  You know, about solvenless.
[16:34.000 --> 16:38.000]  So I like the education.
[16:38.000 --> 16:40.760]  I think it only goes to show that that oral tradition
[16:40.760 --> 16:43.920]  needs to be incorporated into a brand
[16:43.920 --> 16:47.160]  if it's going to have legs with consumers
[16:47.160 --> 16:48.800]  that know what they're doing.
[16:48.800 --> 16:50.640]  Yeah, yeah, the legacy, you know,
[16:50.640 --> 16:52.960]  and like telling the true stories.
[16:54.320 --> 16:55.320]  And that's a perfect example.
[16:55.320 --> 16:56.960]  They shout me out all the time for like,
[16:56.960 --> 16:58.720]  literally for pushing them, you know,
[16:58.720 --> 17:01.040]  into the world of solvenless.
[17:01.040 --> 17:02.600]  And I'm like, I'm pushing them, you know,
[17:02.600 --> 17:04.720]  into moving into solvenless.
[17:07.080 --> 17:09.520]  Yeah, I love the stories
[17:09.520 --> 17:11.560]  and how these brands are surviving from that.
[17:12.840 --> 17:14.720]  You mentioned the winning cups
[17:14.720 --> 17:16.840]  and sort of the award scene.
[17:16.840 --> 17:20.400]  I have to say that I grew up in Southeast Asia
[17:20.400 --> 17:23.600]  and the concept of cannabis awards
[17:23.600 --> 17:27.120]  was one of the most exotic things I'd ever seen
[17:27.120 --> 17:30.040]  when I moved to the US.
[17:30.040 --> 17:30.880]  So what was your experience?
[17:30.880 --> 17:32.840]  How has award culture changed
[17:32.840 --> 17:34.760]  and what were some of your like favorite
[17:34.760 --> 17:37.400]  and least favorite experiences therein?
[17:38.360 --> 17:39.760]  Oh man, well,
[17:41.360 --> 17:43.960]  there still needs to be a lot more standardization
[17:43.960 --> 17:45.480]  and I'm working on that daily.
[17:47.080 --> 17:52.080]  Basically standardizing the analysis of these cups,
[17:52.760 --> 17:53.840]  the backend.
[17:53.840 --> 17:55.480]  But I mean, from the beginning,
[17:55.480 --> 17:57.600]  I've been involved in a lot of, you know,
[17:57.600 --> 18:00.040]  I was involved in the first cannabis cup
[18:00.040 --> 18:02.000]  that High Times brought to the United States.
[18:02.000 --> 18:03.800]  I mean, before High Times came to the United States,
[18:03.800 --> 18:07.120]  I was involved in some of the cannabis cups in Amsterdam.
[18:07.120 --> 18:10.320]  I was DJing at the Melkweg for High Times.
[18:12.280 --> 18:16.760]  I've seen so much, you know, and it's had its ebb and flow.
[18:16.760 --> 18:19.480]  Some of the stuff that's really hard to see,
[18:19.480 --> 18:20.600]  I'm just gonna start there,
[18:20.600 --> 18:23.040]  I'm just jabbing at it right now,
[18:23.040 --> 18:26.680]  is when these states over-regulated
[18:26.680 --> 18:28.800]  and we had these amazing cannabis cups,
[18:28.800 --> 18:30.960]  but then, you know, social consumption
[18:30.960 --> 18:35.520]  and oftentimes because some of these event coordinators
[18:35.520 --> 18:39.200]  didn't clean up, you know, and do their part
[18:39.200 --> 18:43.560]  to provide the professionalism that was needed.
[18:43.560 --> 18:45.280]  But either way, you know,
[18:45.280 --> 18:47.880]  a lot of this isn't allowed to happen anymore.
[18:47.880 --> 18:50.880]  You know, I used to throw some pretty large events,
[18:50.880 --> 18:53.960]  some of which involved cannabis cups,
[18:53.960 --> 18:55.520]  some of which were just big, you know,
[18:55.560 --> 18:59.920]  musical events at Cervantes, Extract Artist Harvest Fest,
[18:59.920 --> 19:02.240]  and I got my card pulled, you know.
[19:02.240 --> 19:04.200]  I also had a license here in Colorado
[19:04.200 --> 19:06.120]  and I started getting emails from the Med,
[19:06.120 --> 19:08.120]  from the Marijuana Enforcement Division,
[19:08.120 --> 19:10.200]  saying, hey, you can't keep sponsoring
[19:10.200 --> 19:13.880]  these public consumption events with your cannabis brand.
[19:15.200 --> 19:17.840]  And I don't know why I kind of pivoted in this direction,
[19:17.840 --> 19:22.400]  but it just became really hard to throw these proper events.
[19:23.240 --> 19:25.720]  And now with our current situation,
[19:25.720 --> 19:28.560]  it might be even harder to throw these events.
[19:28.560 --> 19:30.440]  So I guess all in all,
[19:30.440 --> 19:35.280]  I'm extremely blessed to have experienced this ebb and flow
[19:35.280 --> 19:38.800]  for the last 10 plus years of cannabis cups
[19:38.800 --> 19:42.080]  and being involved from the very beginning.
[19:42.080 --> 19:45.840]  You know, I helped create the actual back end
[19:45.840 --> 19:48.600]  for the non-solvent category for high times,
[19:48.600 --> 19:51.840]  which has now been used in a number of different events.
[19:53.080 --> 19:55.520]  We judged and I hosted the very first
[19:55.520 --> 19:57.360]  Rosin Only competition ever,
[19:57.360 --> 20:00.720]  and that one was in Barcelona, Spain, big up HQ.
[20:02.960 --> 20:06.120]  You know, just extremely blessed to be involved
[20:06.120 --> 20:09.360]  in so many of these events and help guide them
[20:09.360 --> 20:11.160]  to, you know, where they got
[20:11.160 --> 20:13.680]  and the professionalism that we attained.
[20:14.760 --> 20:17.160]  That's a very good way to think about it
[20:17.160 --> 20:18.840]  from a point of view of gratitude
[20:18.840 --> 20:21.560]  and getting to experience things
[20:21.560 --> 20:24.120]  from the early days of this industry.
[20:24.120 --> 20:27.520]  I feel like there's quite a lot of chagrin right now
[20:27.520 --> 20:31.200]  with more corporate entities and corporate events,
[20:31.200 --> 20:34.200]  kind of like sprinkling cannabis participation in,
[20:34.200 --> 20:37.040]  in a very, almost in an ornamental style
[20:37.040 --> 20:39.520]  that people in the medical community
[20:39.520 --> 20:41.880]  especially don't appreciate.
[20:41.880 --> 20:45.680]  It's like, it's a conversation right now.
[20:45.680 --> 20:48.240]  I've definitely been to one or two corporate events
[20:48.640 --> 20:52.360]  that are bizarre and it's, I don't know.
[20:52.360 --> 20:55.120]  I think what a lot of us want are basically
[20:55.120 --> 20:58.000]  farmer's markets with really, really excellent security.
[20:59.520 --> 21:00.480]  Yeah, yeah.
[21:00.480 --> 21:02.160]  I mean, those were epic back in the day.
[21:02.160 --> 21:05.240]  I mean, it's hard with where they've already
[21:05.240 --> 21:08.120]  brought the regulation to even allow any type
[21:08.120 --> 21:11.240]  of cannabis market or sesh per se.
[21:11.240 --> 21:13.920]  I mean, of course we're seeing these legacy sessions
[21:13.920 --> 21:15.920]  still happening all over the world,
[21:16.920 --> 21:21.680]  but yeah, it puts me in a really fucked up position
[21:21.680 --> 21:22.800]  to be completely honest.
[21:22.800 --> 21:26.120]  You know, like, I mean, I came from the unregulated market
[21:26.120 --> 21:27.720]  a long time ago, but I rolled up.
[21:27.720 --> 21:29.680]  I was one of the first of my friends
[21:29.680 --> 21:32.440]  and my people to roll up into this regulated market,
[21:33.320 --> 21:35.360]  not to go on another tangent for too long,
[21:35.360 --> 21:39.440]  but just as far as like when I post a picture of hash,
[21:39.440 --> 21:40.960]  like, I mean, 10 years ago
[21:40.960 --> 21:43.440]  when I started posting these photos of hash online
[21:43.440 --> 21:44.440]  and I was in Colorado,
[21:44.440 --> 21:46.640]  I had all my California friends being like,
[21:46.640 --> 21:47.880]  yo, let me get some of that.
[21:47.880 --> 21:50.680]  And they just, you know, it just doesn't work that way.
[21:50.680 --> 21:52.960]  Now that I'm in this regulated market
[21:52.960 --> 21:56.080]  and I'm being watched, you know, I don't ship anything.
[21:56.080 --> 22:01.080]  I haven't sold a single gram, you know, unregulated gram.
[22:01.200 --> 22:05.320]  Everything I make is in a regulated lab.
[22:05.320 --> 22:06.960]  It then gets tested.
[22:06.960 --> 22:08.560]  It gets pushed through distribution
[22:08.560 --> 22:10.120]  and it gets sold through avenues.
[22:10.120 --> 22:12.120]  And I'm definitely helping with those sales
[22:12.120 --> 22:15.760]  and I'm on the ground, but I'm not personally,
[22:15.760 --> 22:17.960]  you know, I don't have access to thousands of grams
[22:17.960 --> 22:19.440]  in my back pocket, you know.
[22:19.440 --> 22:23.040]  It's not how it was 20 years ago, you know.
[22:23.040 --> 22:27.360]  And it's really hard to explain that still today,
[22:29.080 --> 22:32.160]  especially because California is like,
[22:34.000 --> 22:36.640]  there's a lot of people still doing it,
[22:36.640 --> 22:39.840]  you know, not the right regulated way.
[22:40.240 --> 22:43.560]  And I'm not trying to like be the narc and need to,
[22:43.560 --> 22:46.040]  you know, we need regulation by any means,
[22:46.040 --> 22:48.160]  but like, that's what's kept me safe.
[22:48.160 --> 22:49.480]  That's the only reason I do it
[22:49.480 --> 22:51.480]  because I wanted to sleep at night, you know.
[22:51.480 --> 22:53.960]  So that's why I stay compliant
[22:53.960 --> 22:55.840]  with everything that I do, you know.
[22:57.560 --> 22:58.480]  Oh, for sure.
[22:58.480 --> 23:00.200]  I mean, even as a consumer,
[23:00.200 --> 23:02.880]  you want to like get your med card and everything
[23:02.880 --> 23:06.760]  and be as above board as possible
[23:06.760 --> 23:09.480]  when it comes to covering your ass.
[23:10.480 --> 23:11.320]  Yeah.
[23:11.320 --> 23:13.120]  It's like, depending on,
[23:13.120 --> 23:14.600]  I was like, that's actually relates though
[23:14.600 --> 23:17.120]  to something I was going to talk to you about
[23:17.120 --> 23:21.440]  because that can be very difficult for some consumers
[23:21.440 --> 23:23.760]  who are used to living in the shadows.
[23:23.760 --> 23:25.960]  And I know that you are a public speaker
[23:25.960 --> 23:27.200]  at a lot of the events you mentioned,
[23:27.200 --> 23:31.560]  and you talk about both your technique
[23:31.560 --> 23:33.360]  and your experiences a lot,
[23:33.360 --> 23:38.360]  but was gaming a platform ever something that gave you pause
[23:39.360 --> 23:41.360]  or worry because of the stigma?
[23:42.920 --> 23:45.320]  Just with cannabis in general?
[23:45.320 --> 23:46.560]  The platform?
[23:46.560 --> 23:48.640]  Does it make me worry?
[23:48.640 --> 23:53.280]  Gaining a platform, like being so public, basically,
[23:53.280 --> 23:55.280]  with your performance and everything.
[23:58.840 --> 24:00.560]  Yes and no.
[24:00.560 --> 24:03.520]  I do everything so by the book
[24:03.520 --> 24:06.240]  that I don't worry about that, you know,
[24:06.240 --> 24:07.640]  to be completely honest.
[24:08.760 --> 24:13.360]  There's other worries that come with being this public.
[24:13.360 --> 24:14.920]  Then, you know, there's always haters out there.
[24:14.920 --> 24:16.200]  There's always trying, you know,
[24:16.200 --> 24:18.520]  someone trying to, you know,
[24:18.520 --> 24:20.560]  say something bad about you or something.
[24:20.560 --> 24:23.800]  But I mean, that's with any platform.
[24:23.800 --> 24:25.160]  That's not just cannabis.
[24:25.160 --> 24:26.080]  True, true.
[24:26.960 --> 24:29.920]  I feel like we've talked a lot about the,
[24:30.960 --> 24:32.600]  back in the day, this and that.
[24:32.600 --> 24:34.880]  And we have come a long way from, I think you said,
[24:34.880 --> 24:37.320]  making bubble hash in your uncle's barn.
[24:38.400 --> 24:39.240]  Yeah.
[24:40.440 --> 24:41.280]  What was that?
[24:41.280 --> 24:42.120]  Where was that barn?
[24:42.120 --> 24:43.640]  What was that like?
[24:43.640 --> 24:46.240]  And I say my uncle, you know,
[24:46.240 --> 24:48.720]  and I'll probably always continue to say my uncle
[24:48.720 --> 24:50.640]  because it was like my uncle.
[24:50.640 --> 24:52.040]  But it was up in Mendocino.
[24:52.040 --> 24:54.440]  I had a lot of family up in Northern California.
[24:56.120 --> 25:00.760]  And I mean, from a young age, I was on a farm, you know,
[25:00.760 --> 25:03.280]  my family, Tandem's family nursery,
[25:03.280 --> 25:04.760]  we had nursery businesses.
[25:04.760 --> 25:06.440]  My dad ran a nursery business.
[25:06.480 --> 25:09.880]  My mom did landscaping
[25:09.880 --> 25:11.600]  as well as running the nursery business.
[25:11.600 --> 25:13.440]  My grandpa and my aunt, you know,
[25:13.440 --> 25:15.960]  my whole family is Green Thumbs.
[25:15.960 --> 25:18.760]  So I started watering the roses, you know,
[25:19.760 --> 25:23.160]  and learned about plants from a very, very young age.
[25:23.160 --> 25:26.880]  So definitely blessed to have that Green Thumb in my blood.
[25:26.880 --> 25:30.400]  And as a young teenager, I got really into weed,
[25:30.400 --> 25:32.720]  you know, at a very young age as well.
[25:32.720 --> 25:35.120]  You know, I'm 13 years old, 14 years old.
[25:36.600 --> 25:39.280]  And, you know, by 15, I was looking for ways to make it
[25:39.280 --> 25:42.280]  and ways to, you know, figure out my habit, 15 years old,
[25:42.280 --> 25:44.080]  you know, and growing up in Northern California,
[25:44.080 --> 25:45.760]  it wasn't too far off, you know,
[25:45.760 --> 25:49.560]  it was very prevalent in Northern California, cannabis.
[25:49.560 --> 25:53.360]  And so, you know, I just linked in with some friends.
[25:53.360 --> 25:55.680]  I also started going to the junior college
[25:55.680 --> 26:00.040]  at a very young age as a teenager, 13 years old.
[26:00.040 --> 26:03.160]  I think I took my first math class at the junior college.
[26:03.160 --> 26:06.360]  So I already had some built-in older friends
[26:07.120 --> 26:09.000]  in the circuit and I just started going up North
[26:09.000 --> 26:10.480]  and, you know, got in where I fit in
[26:10.480 --> 26:13.280]  and started bringing trim back down to the Bay Area
[26:13.280 --> 26:17.040]  and making bubble hash also in that hot barn
[26:17.040 --> 26:19.040]  and then bringing wet hash down.
[26:19.040 --> 26:22.360]  And so that's kind of why I say we've come a long way
[26:22.360 --> 26:24.160]  from making bubble hash in a barn
[26:24.160 --> 26:29.000]  because I was making this wet, pliable mildew smelling,
[26:29.000 --> 26:31.040]  really, like when I think back on it,
[26:32.160 --> 26:34.040]  because we were trapping so much water.
[26:34.080 --> 26:36.440]  Like I even remember, we tried everything,
[26:36.440 --> 26:39.440]  putting it in like bandanas and putting it in our back pocket
[26:39.440 --> 26:42.720]  and driving back down 101 to try and dry it out.
[26:42.720 --> 26:45.280]  I remember putting it in cellophane
[26:45.280 --> 26:47.880]  and putting it in the bottom of my shoe, you know,
[26:47.880 --> 26:50.520]  like who really wants to smoke nicotine shoe hash?
[26:52.720 --> 26:54.440]  So there was a lot of trial and error
[26:54.440 --> 26:57.000]  that we went through to get to where we're at today.
[26:57.000 --> 26:58.240]  And that's the point of that, you know,
[26:58.240 --> 27:01.520]  we went from making that pliable mildew smelling
[27:01.520 --> 27:06.040]  black brown goo to making these clear diamonds,
[27:06.040 --> 27:08.160]  you know, in all reality,
[27:08.160 --> 27:11.720]  that's almost a pinnacle of the full separation
[27:11.720 --> 27:14.480]  that we've been able to achieve via mechanical means.
[27:15.640 --> 27:18.760]  In fact, when we first started separating THCA,
[27:18.760 --> 27:22.480]  we were using a few different labs in Colorado.
[27:22.480 --> 27:27.480]  And we, on some of those first tests, we got 108% THCA
[27:27.680 --> 27:31.240]  because our THCA was stronger than the standard
[27:31.960 --> 27:32.800]  that the lab was using.
[27:32.800 --> 27:33.640]  So we had to adjust.
[27:35.080 --> 27:37.560]  So, you know, we're making just as strong,
[27:37.560 --> 27:40.600]  if not stronger than hydrocarbon products
[27:40.600 --> 27:42.680]  with just mechanical separations
[27:42.680 --> 27:47.560]  and not necessarily strong, but separations, you know,
[27:47.560 --> 27:52.560]  getting to different degrees.
[27:53.240 --> 27:54.080]  Absolutely.
[27:54.080 --> 27:56.000]  And it sounds like from the beginning,
[27:56.000 --> 27:58.000]  it was all about controlling
[27:58.000 --> 28:00.160]  and experimenting with the variables.
[28:00.160 --> 28:03.200]  You've mentioned like pressure, temperature and everything.
[28:03.200 --> 28:06.160]  And it's, I feel like that might be, I don't know,
[28:06.160 --> 28:08.920]  see if you agree with me, that might be an area where,
[28:10.200 --> 28:13.760]  I guess you could say big ag science and craftsmanship
[28:13.760 --> 28:15.160]  and the oral tradition that you mentioned
[28:15.160 --> 28:18.320]  could really differ because one is going to be
[28:18.320 --> 28:22.120]  basically obsessed with margins and the other with results.
[28:23.840 --> 28:26.360]  But a lot of it is similar as well, you know,
[28:26.360 --> 28:29.200]  not to like, I'm just playing devil's advocate too here.
[28:29.200 --> 28:32.480]  A lot of it's similar because the,
[28:32.480 --> 28:36.920]  we're able to use similar pressure and temperature
[28:36.920 --> 28:41.200]  that hydrocarbon is using to achieve the same consistency,
[28:41.200 --> 28:44.280]  you know, even down to, yeah,
[28:44.280 --> 28:46.840]  the pressure we're building and the temperature
[28:46.840 --> 28:49.280]  that people are running at in the hydrocarbon world
[28:49.280 --> 28:52.560]  is very similar to what we're doing in the butane,
[28:52.560 --> 28:54.320]  or sorry, in the solventless world.
[28:54.320 --> 28:55.160]  Yeah.
[28:57.920 --> 29:01.960]  I just to bring it to something recent,
[29:01.960 --> 29:06.080]  I have, I want to ask you to talk about the frizz,
[29:06.080 --> 29:07.920]  the frittle, the frittles.
[29:08.800 --> 29:09.640]  Yeah.
[29:09.640 --> 29:12.480]  The frittles, is that right?
[29:12.480 --> 29:14.360]  Yeah, no, that's perfect, frittles.
[29:14.360 --> 29:17.520]  Frittles, yeah, so the frittles is a strain
[29:17.520 --> 29:20.080]  that was bred by a friend of mine named Brian,
[29:20.080 --> 29:22.400]  365 Cannon Farms, Valley B.
[29:24.960 --> 29:27.280]  It's skittles times forbidden fruit.
[29:27.280 --> 29:31.440]  Now the craziest part about this is skittles,
[29:31.440 --> 29:35.360]  amazing candy flavor, I'm sure a lot of us are familiar,
[29:36.560 --> 29:41.040]  but generally not like the highest water hash yielder,
[29:41.040 --> 29:44.360]  not the most viable to run alone.
[29:45.440 --> 29:47.760]  Forbidden fruit, even worse,
[29:47.760 --> 29:51.760]  amazing citrus candy flavor on the forbidden fruit.
[29:52.640 --> 29:55.840]  It's got that like tangy flavor,
[29:55.840 --> 29:59.080]  but straight purple, super, super dark flowers.
[30:00.640 --> 30:05.280]  And it generally washes like less than one to 2%.
[30:05.280 --> 30:08.160]  So it's really not a hash making strain.
[30:08.160 --> 30:10.000]  It's, I've ran it a few times
[30:10.000 --> 30:11.920]  just because it's such an amazing terpene,
[30:11.920 --> 30:16.920]  it's so floral and citrus, but it's not a hasher.
[30:17.360 --> 30:21.040]  Somehow this strain and this phenotype
[30:21.040 --> 30:26.040]  that Bee found and that Cali Kosher cultivated,
[30:26.880 --> 30:31.480]  so big up Cali Kosher, was a washer.
[30:31.480 --> 30:35.920]  We yielded like, I think 4.8 to 5% overall.
[30:35.920 --> 30:40.280]  And even once we got down to what we utilized,
[30:40.280 --> 30:43.360]  only just for the amazing rosin that we put out,
[30:43.360 --> 30:46.080]  I think we were still over 3.8,
[30:46.080 --> 30:49.360]  we're sorry, over 4% yield
[30:50.200 --> 30:52.560]  with all the usable fractions.
[30:52.560 --> 30:55.040]  So just a really, and that's from fresh frozen.
[30:55.040 --> 30:59.080]  If you convert that into dry weight, basically,
[30:59.080 --> 31:03.640]  you're talking like a 20% yield from dry trim or dry flower,
[31:04.680 --> 31:08.760]  which is a really good yield for something of that nature,
[31:08.760 --> 31:11.440]  something that's that strong and pungent.
[31:11.440 --> 31:15.320]  But the main reason that I hunted that one down,
[31:15.320 --> 31:17.480]  I first tried that strain when I was in Barcelona,
[31:17.800 --> 31:20.480]  actually, sometimes I just, I smell something
[31:20.480 --> 31:23.040]  or I taste something and I'm like, I have to have it.
[31:23.040 --> 31:25.560]  And that's generally what I base my collaborations on,
[31:25.560 --> 31:27.200]  it's like strictly passionate,
[31:27.200 --> 31:30.520]  something that I personally really wanna put my name on.
[31:30.520 --> 31:33.640]  I won't put my name on something I can't fully stand behind.
[31:33.640 --> 31:36.720]  So that Frittles is something that I personally sourced out.
[31:36.720 --> 31:39.480]  I tasted that flavor, I had to have it.
[31:39.480 --> 31:43.120]  I hit up Darren over at Cali Kosher
[31:43.120 --> 31:45.720]  and I was like, yo, I need this material.
[31:45.760 --> 31:48.040]  We did a collaboration over at Dot Greens
[31:48.040 --> 31:51.680]  where I washed it and then the Dot Greens guys
[31:53.720 --> 31:55.760]  pressed it into rosin.
[31:55.760 --> 32:00.760]  So yeah, it was all around, a lot of love that went into it,
[32:02.040 --> 32:05.480]  a lot of feet on the ground, a lot of hands in the water.
[32:05.480 --> 32:08.280]  It was definitely drooling over those posts.
[32:08.280 --> 32:11.040]  Peter, could we show people if it's,
[32:11.040 --> 32:13.960]  is the essential extracts page public?
[32:13.960 --> 32:15.040]  I can't remember.
[32:15.440 --> 32:16.520]  Yeah, everything should be public.
[32:16.520 --> 32:18.080]  I'm pretty damn public.
[32:20.920 --> 32:22.680]  Paste the check, paste the check.
[32:23.680 --> 32:26.280]  Just checking on if we have any,
[32:26.280 --> 32:29.240]  and if we have any questions, let me check.
[32:31.920 --> 32:35.200]  Something I smoked today got me serious cotton mouth.
[32:35.200 --> 32:40.200]  Anthro Sensamea asked about your involvement with papaya.
[32:42.240 --> 32:43.720]  A lot of people keep asking this
[32:43.720 --> 32:48.720]  and it's kind of a mythical story, but my side of it-
[32:49.760 --> 32:51.880]  Let's perpetuate the myth.
[32:51.880 --> 32:54.000]  Yeah, my side of the story is that
[32:55.400 --> 32:58.120]  one of those first times that I went out to Amsterdam,
[32:59.560 --> 33:01.840]  I was collecting a lot of those Dutch seeds,
[33:01.840 --> 33:03.160]  a lot of European seeds.
[33:03.160 --> 33:05.280]  And there was a long time in the United States
[33:05.280 --> 33:07.960]  where people didn't want any European seeds.
[33:09.440 --> 33:11.080]  But anyways, that's a side point.
[33:11.080 --> 33:16.080]  And I went to Mila's shop.
[33:16.120 --> 33:18.080]  I was constantly hanging out at Mila's shop.
[33:18.080 --> 33:20.440]  And I got a bunch of packs that year.
[33:20.440 --> 33:24.280]  But one of the many packs that I brought back with me
[33:24.280 --> 33:27.680]  was Nirvana Seeds papaya.
[33:28.720 --> 33:32.480]  And I kept that pack for a long time.
[33:32.480 --> 33:34.240]  And that was just one of the many packs
[33:34.240 --> 33:36.040]  that I brought into Pink House.
[33:36.040 --> 33:40.480]  And we popped at Pink House, which was a dispensary that,
[33:40.720 --> 33:42.640]  I did a lot of work with.
[33:42.640 --> 33:44.600]  We set up a lab inside Pink House.
[33:44.600 --> 33:46.920]  It was one of my first labs in Colorado.
[33:48.000 --> 33:53.000]  And we popped a bunch of seeds and I was washing.
[33:53.600 --> 33:55.920]  I was making hash at that lab at Pink House.
[33:55.920 --> 33:57.920]  And so I was finding things that I liked
[33:57.920 --> 34:00.160]  that were yielding, that were proper.
[34:00.160 --> 34:02.880]  And that was one of the phenos of papaya that we kept.
[34:02.880 --> 34:04.240]  It did really well for BHO
[34:04.240 --> 34:06.400]  and it did really well for us in the solvents lab.
[34:06.400 --> 34:08.160]  You got the spotlight.
[34:08.160 --> 34:09.400]  Yeah, the spotlight.
[34:09.400 --> 34:10.960]  And I was waiting.
[34:10.960 --> 34:15.800]  So this is one of the collaboration ones, right?
[34:15.800 --> 34:19.080]  That's the frittles that we just dropped in California.
[34:21.880 --> 34:22.720]  Got it.
[34:22.720 --> 34:23.960]  Oh, it looks so tasty.
[34:33.160 --> 34:34.560]  And this was fresh pressed.
[34:37.920 --> 34:39.560]  This is a great one for fresh pressed,
[34:39.560 --> 34:42.800]  especially because it came from a purple strain.
[34:42.800 --> 34:44.960]  And I feel like a lot of those tarps
[34:44.960 --> 34:47.040]  are really air volatile.
[34:47.040 --> 34:48.760]  Also the degradation,
[34:48.760 --> 34:51.640]  you see the hash get a little bit darker
[34:51.640 --> 34:53.480]  if we did like a pressure tech.
[34:54.600 --> 34:56.120]  But I didn't have too much involvement
[34:56.120 --> 34:57.520]  in the rosin pressing of it.
[34:57.520 --> 34:59.880]  And just the washing and making sure it was clean.
[34:59.880 --> 35:02.720]  I mean, really the sourcing was a key part
[35:02.720 --> 35:05.520]  of what I played in that picture.
[35:08.620 --> 35:10.500]  Yeah, I mean, the tarps are just amazing.
[35:10.500 --> 35:11.780]  Like it's what I wanna smoke.
[35:11.780 --> 35:14.020]  I actually, I think I have some of the hash here
[35:14.780 --> 35:16.700]  I'm gonna smoke it all actually.
[35:18.260 --> 35:20.660]  What are you smoking right now?
[35:20.660 --> 35:24.020]  Oh, right this second I'm smoking some Cushmints.
[35:25.420 --> 35:28.420]  Yeah, some Cushmints.
[35:34.380 --> 35:37.900]  I made a yum noise and then it changed to the same thing,
[35:37.900 --> 35:39.980]  but it was a glorious nug.
[35:39.980 --> 35:42.620]  I'm actually, I'm pretty flushed right now with tarps.
[35:42.660 --> 35:44.540]  People have been stoking me.
[35:44.540 --> 35:47.860]  Rosin Tech is actually one of my partners in LA.
[35:49.940 --> 35:51.820]  And they just, I'd help them.
[35:51.820 --> 35:54.180]  I DJ their launch party out here.
[35:54.180 --> 35:57.700]  I just hooked it up with some fire rosin.
[35:59.100 --> 36:02.260]  It's from the homie Ben McCabe over there.
[36:02.260 --> 36:03.540]  Show me tarps.
[36:03.540 --> 36:06.180]  I keep telling Ben to come on and yeah,
[36:06.180 --> 36:08.820]  he's like, I just got back from Colorado.
[36:08.820 --> 36:10.380]  I'm exhausted or.
[36:10.380 --> 36:11.460]  Yeah, yeah.
[36:11.500 --> 36:14.220]  He was sick a couple of weeks ago.
[36:14.220 --> 36:17.260]  I've been wanting to try this guy's stuff for a long time.
[36:17.260 --> 36:20.780]  And I actually haven't even tried it, just got it today.
[36:20.780 --> 36:25.100]  But super, super proper jam consistency
[36:25.100 --> 36:27.140]  and smells really, really loud.
[36:29.220 --> 36:31.460]  I've been watching him for a minute.
[36:31.460 --> 36:32.940]  So I'm kind of excited.
[36:32.940 --> 36:34.260]  Who is that?
[36:34.260 --> 36:35.340]  Dog Man Troop.
[36:35.340 --> 36:36.940]  He's like straight crushing right now.
[36:36.940 --> 36:40.340]  Check out his page, Dog Man Troop.
[36:42.460 --> 36:46.860]  Dude's really humble and he's doing amazing, amazing work.
[36:49.830 --> 36:51.870]  Check him out, check him out.
[36:51.870 --> 36:54.150]  And then I'm actually, I'm blessed to actually
[36:54.150 --> 36:56.350]  finally get to smoke some of my own stuff.
[36:56.350 --> 36:58.310]  I made some sour banana sherbet.
[36:58.310 --> 36:59.950]  This is actually the 185.
[36:59.950 --> 37:03.270]  I'm just, I really still like the big, big heads,
[37:03.270 --> 37:04.510]  the big microns.
[37:09.050 --> 37:11.570]  Yeah, here's some of the 90.
[37:11.570 --> 37:14.650]  Here, hold on, let me just, this is Dog Man Troop.
[37:14.650 --> 37:15.490]  All right.
[37:16.370 --> 37:18.370]  Wait, hold that back up.
[37:20.370 --> 37:21.570]  What, this one?
[37:21.570 --> 37:22.410]  Yeah.
[37:23.650 --> 37:29.460]  This is some sour banana sherbet
[37:29.460 --> 37:32.180]  grown by Greener Way Strategies.
[37:34.460 --> 37:35.540]  Old school brethren.
[37:37.140 --> 37:37.980]  Yeah.
[37:40.430 --> 37:41.630]  Pretty loud.
[37:41.630 --> 37:43.550]  I'm happy, happy with it.
[37:44.390 --> 37:45.230]  Yeah.
[37:45.230 --> 37:46.070]  You've talked so much about this.
[37:46.070 --> 37:46.910]  I'm pretty toasted right now.
[37:46.910 --> 37:48.990]  It's like, I think it's like 11 or, no, no.
[37:48.990 --> 37:50.990]  It's only like 10 o'clock over here.
[37:50.990 --> 37:52.310]  Not even.
[37:52.310 --> 37:53.350]  I'm just fucking high.
[37:53.350 --> 37:54.670]  What's up?
[37:54.670 --> 37:57.870]  Well, I could use a dab, so I'm gonna load one.
[37:57.870 --> 37:58.710]  Yeah.
[37:59.710 --> 38:03.070]  Yeah, I wish I could digitally share a dab with you.
[38:03.070 --> 38:04.910]  Please try some of this fire.
[38:04.910 --> 38:07.030]  Cheers, everybody.
[38:07.030 --> 38:08.590]  I just dropped the lid though.
[38:08.590 --> 38:09.430]  Cheers.
[38:09.430 --> 38:10.270]  Cheers.
[38:10.270 --> 38:11.110]  Cheers.
[38:11.110 --> 38:11.950]  Cheers.
[38:11.950 --> 38:12.790]  Cheers.
[38:15.510 --> 38:18.590]  Dabbing, let's bring it back to music.
[38:18.590 --> 38:21.430]  What's some new music that...
[38:25.430 --> 38:27.430]  There's so much good new music coming out.
[38:27.430 --> 38:30.830]  I mean, every fucking hour I'm downloading something
[38:30.830 --> 38:33.710]  or getting music or talking to producer friends,
[38:33.710 --> 38:34.670]  I'm kind of addicted.
[38:34.670 --> 38:37.590]  I'm on this nice music kick right now.
[38:38.590 --> 38:39.630]  Awesome.
[38:39.630 --> 38:41.270]  Definitely because it was released, what,
[38:41.270 --> 38:42.950]  yesterday or the day before.
[38:42.950 --> 38:46.230]  Check out my brethren, DJ Theory's newest mixtape
[38:46.230 --> 38:48.790]  called the Essential Business Mixtape.
[38:48.790 --> 38:51.750]  I mean, fitting, because we're essential extracts.
[38:51.750 --> 38:53.270]  We've been essential.
[38:53.270 --> 38:54.830]  He just dropped the Essential Mixtape,
[38:54.830 --> 38:56.790]  hosted by another good friend of mine,
[38:56.790 --> 38:58.150]  John M. Blackamore.
[38:59.110 --> 39:01.110]  Really conscious mixtape.
[39:01.110 --> 39:02.350]  Listen to the lyrics.
[39:02.350 --> 39:04.110]  It's proper as fuck.
[39:06.310 --> 39:08.270]  Artists?
[39:08.270 --> 39:10.830]  I've been really liking...
[39:10.870 --> 39:13.510]  I was actually just showing some of my guests over here,
[39:13.510 --> 39:15.430]  this artist named Lila Ike.
[39:17.830 --> 39:20.470]  Coffee, of course, coffee is crushing in my world.
[39:20.470 --> 39:22.830]  I'm a reggae DJ pretty much through and through.
[39:22.830 --> 39:24.270]  I play everything though.
[39:24.270 --> 39:28.110]  I play everything from Latin vibes to Afrobeat,
[39:28.110 --> 39:31.470]  to trap music, to house music.
[39:34.310 --> 39:39.150]  You know, I've been digging a little of everything lately.
[39:39.270 --> 39:43.630]  I've been liking super dirty, dark, deep bass house music
[39:43.630 --> 39:45.230]  from the Bay Area.
[39:45.230 --> 39:46.870]  I've been liking...
[39:48.670 --> 39:50.310]  Oh man, one of my favorite songs
[39:50.310 --> 39:52.030]  that I've just been playing on repeat
[39:52.030 --> 39:53.790]  for the last 48 hours as well,
[39:53.790 --> 39:56.510]  because it just got released like yesterday.
[39:56.510 --> 39:59.790]  My brethren, Johann Marley,
[40:00.950 --> 40:02.550]  featuring Joe Mercer Marley.
[40:02.550 --> 40:04.870]  These are Steven Marley's sons.
[40:05.870 --> 40:09.750]  But they are just, I don't know,
[40:09.750 --> 40:12.150]  this new song called Brick Hell,
[40:12.150 --> 40:13.750]  it's just hitting for me.
[40:15.150 --> 40:17.670]  And it's not even like, if you try and search for it,
[40:17.670 --> 40:19.950]  like you can find it on Google,
[40:19.950 --> 40:21.910]  but like it won't pop up on my Instagram.
[40:21.910 --> 40:24.750]  I keep wanting to show the homie love,
[40:24.750 --> 40:26.070]  but it's brand new.
[40:26.070 --> 40:29.510]  So check out Brick Hell or Brickle.
[40:29.510 --> 40:32.190]  I don't know how to pronounce it exactly,
[40:32.190 --> 40:33.950]  but Johann Marley.
[40:35.270 --> 40:37.430]  Johann Marley, crushing.
[40:37.430 --> 40:38.310]  Awesome.
[40:38.310 --> 40:41.670]  I think it's been great to see how many musicians,
[40:41.670 --> 40:44.030]  and there's quite a few of them
[40:44.030 --> 40:46.830]  that have managed to like stay creative this year,
[40:46.830 --> 40:48.190]  despite everything going on.
[40:48.190 --> 40:49.590]  Like, I don't know if you've heard
[40:49.590 --> 40:51.070]  the new Glass Animals album,
[40:51.070 --> 40:56.030]  but that's like all produced remotely and it slaps.
[40:56.030 --> 40:56.870]  I need to hear that.
[40:56.870 --> 40:59.470]  No, I know them, but I haven't heard the album at all.
[41:00.350 --> 41:03.390]  Yeah, I feel like people who've seen me on IG
[41:03.390 --> 41:05.870]  know that I fell in love with weed and rock and roll
[41:05.870 --> 41:06.910]  in the same summer.
[41:08.830 --> 41:11.510]  And so in that case, it was Jimi Hendrix,
[41:11.510 --> 41:14.310]  but I have a lot of memories where cannabis and music
[41:14.310 --> 41:16.910]  are so connected and they have to be.
[41:16.910 --> 41:19.670]  And I remember definitely having Jace ready for,
[41:19.670 --> 41:22.270]  oh my gosh, like, oh, the Black Keys are tonight.
[41:22.270 --> 41:25.390]  When that song comes on, I've got to have one ready.
[41:25.390 --> 41:27.270]  And it's such a, I don't know.
[41:27.270 --> 41:29.990]  I also feel like it makes one feel connected
[41:29.990 --> 41:33.030]  to the concerts of yore.
[41:35.350 --> 41:38.750]  Yeah, I mean, music and ganja have gone hand in hand
[41:38.750 --> 41:41.390]  for me since day one for eternity.
[41:43.870 --> 41:44.950]  Yeah, yeah.
[41:44.950 --> 41:46.750]  As I explained, it's how I came up.
[41:47.750 --> 41:50.990]  I was selling weed in the fucking alleyways of the clubs
[41:50.990 --> 41:53.590]  as I was passing out flyers, like for real,
[41:53.590 --> 41:58.590]  on a real level, like coming up from the mud for real.
[41:59.430 --> 42:00.270]  Yeah.
[42:01.870 --> 42:03.190]  Cheers to that.
[42:04.910 --> 42:08.070]  Mia was doing that after math class in Hong Kong.
[42:10.070 --> 42:10.910]  All the high school math teams.
[42:10.910 --> 42:12.070]  We all came from somewhere.
[42:12.070 --> 42:13.830]  We all came from somewhere, right?
[42:15.310 --> 42:17.590]  I would still like to visit my hometown at some point,
[42:17.590 --> 42:18.790]  so I'm not gonna comment.
[42:18.790 --> 42:23.110]  However, I will say that the first hash I ever saw
[42:24.470 --> 42:27.750]  is what people in Southern California may refer to
[42:27.910 --> 42:29.110]  as butt hash.
[42:29.990 --> 42:30.830]  Because it was like-
[42:30.830 --> 42:33.030]  Like culo, like yeah, the fucking,
[42:33.030 --> 42:35.750]  the torpedo looking things from Morocco
[42:35.750 --> 42:39.750]  that get shipped here in somebody's cabin.
[42:41.390 --> 42:43.070]  Like you just, you'll see them sometimes
[42:43.070 --> 42:45.870]  in a casual setting and be like, where has that been?
[42:47.590 --> 42:49.550]  Oh yeah, there's been a lot of articles
[42:49.550 --> 42:53.710]  about those hash pellets.
[42:54.150 --> 42:59.150]  And the microbials and fuckery that they contain,
[42:59.670 --> 43:01.510]  but people still smoke them.
[43:02.990 --> 43:05.070]  And like, to be completely honest,
[43:06.230 --> 43:09.230]  I'd probably still smoke it to continue to.
[43:09.230 --> 43:12.710]  Actually, I have some like, not actual butt hash,
[43:12.710 --> 43:16.190]  but old school style hash that I still enjoy quite a bit.
[43:20.910 --> 43:23.030]  That was slightly too hot.
[43:23.070 --> 43:23.990]  Oh shit.
[43:27.390 --> 43:28.230]  Butt hash over hot dabs.
[43:28.230 --> 43:30.470]  So it's a balance, right?
[43:30.470 --> 43:34.230]  Between like, whether you want the hot dabs
[43:34.230 --> 43:36.870]  so that you can just get fucked up and forget your worries,
[43:36.870 --> 43:38.710]  or if you wanna savor the turps
[43:38.710 --> 43:41.230]  and just have a bit of a sommelier moment
[43:41.230 --> 43:42.910]  and appreciate the bouquet.
[43:43.910 --> 43:45.950]  But may I ask what your,
[43:47.190 --> 43:48.710]  I know this is a big question,
[43:48.710 --> 43:50.390]  but your preferred dab methods,
[43:50.390 --> 43:52.950]  and I know it might change from dab to dab,
[43:53.750 --> 43:55.790]  but what temperature is the sweet spot for you?
[43:55.790 --> 43:58.430]  What banner type is the sweet spot for you?
[43:58.430 --> 44:00.870]  Well, I gotta be completely honest.
[44:01.790 --> 44:05.870]  I dab rarely.
[44:05.870 --> 44:08.830]  I mean, I'm a spliff smoker.
[44:08.830 --> 44:10.390]  I shouldn't say rarely,
[44:10.390 --> 44:12.870]  because like, I dabbed just yesterday.
[44:12.870 --> 44:16.630]  I mean, I dab still like, you know, every couple of days,
[44:16.630 --> 44:18.110]  you know, but I'm not like a hard,
[44:18.110 --> 44:20.870]  I'm not dabbing, you know, 50 dabs a day,
[44:20.870 --> 44:23.590]  like a lot of my friends, to be completely honest.
[44:23.590 --> 44:26.550]  I'll smoke a whole gram in a sitting,
[44:26.550 --> 44:29.830]  you know, in a spliff easily.
[44:29.830 --> 44:31.990]  Like, I'll roll up a whole gram into a donut,
[44:31.990 --> 44:34.390]  or I'll homogenize it into my spliff,
[44:34.390 --> 44:37.350]  and that's kind of how I smoke my hash.
[44:37.350 --> 44:42.350]  But when I do dab, I'm a low temp dabber, for sure.
[44:44.790 --> 44:46.830]  I'm not, I want just the turps.
[44:46.830 --> 44:48.310]  I don't wanna die.
[44:48.310 --> 44:50.270]  My lungs are already pretty fucked.
[44:51.670 --> 44:55.510]  So temperature right now, I just got this dab right thing.
[44:55.510 --> 44:56.910]  I'm looking at it over here.
[44:57.790 --> 44:59.190]  And to be completely honest,
[44:59.190 --> 45:00.510]  I'm still kind of dialing it in.
[45:00.510 --> 45:01.910]  I feel like it varies a little bit
[45:01.910 --> 45:05.270]  depending on how close I am to the nail,
[45:05.270 --> 45:07.230]  which shouldn't really be the case.
[45:07.230 --> 45:09.350]  So I'm still trying to figure it out.
[45:10.350 --> 45:15.230]  But I'm like right around, I'm like 450 to 490.
[45:15.230 --> 45:16.710]  I'm like real low.
[45:16.750 --> 45:19.630]  Ooh, oh, I see.
[45:19.630 --> 45:21.190]  Yeah, I'm low.
[45:21.190 --> 45:22.670]  Quite the connoisseur.
[45:22.670 --> 45:25.510]  You're a flavor hound.
[45:25.510 --> 45:26.350]  It's funny,
[45:26.350 --> 45:29.110]  because we were talking about the dab right the other night.
[45:29.110 --> 45:30.310]  So this is the second time
[45:30.310 --> 45:32.230]  I've heard someone talking about it.
[45:34.990 --> 45:38.150]  Yeah, I just got it gifted to me by Zanextract.
[45:38.150 --> 45:40.350]  The brethren just sent me one.
[45:40.350 --> 45:41.230]  They got the homie.
[45:41.230 --> 45:42.790]  I think, I'm pretty sure it was Zanextract.
[45:42.790 --> 45:45.870]  Fuck, hope they're not misquoting.
[45:45.870 --> 45:47.670]  But yeah, the brethren sent me one.
[45:47.670 --> 45:50.070]  He thought I would need it and enjoy it.
[45:50.070 --> 45:53.670]  And I do like it because I'm a numbers person.
[45:53.670 --> 45:55.190]  Like I wanna be able to tell people
[45:55.190 --> 46:00.070]  what exact temperature I like to dab that product at.
[46:00.070 --> 46:02.990]  So that part is key, but I still am just dialing it in.
[46:02.990 --> 46:04.710]  And like, you gotta get,
[46:04.710 --> 46:08.790]  I feel like you gotta get the exact right distance
[46:08.790 --> 46:11.550]  dialed in first and foremost for your nail.
[46:12.950 --> 46:14.710]  I'm still figuring that part out.
[46:14.710 --> 46:15.550]  What are they called?
[46:15.550 --> 46:16.630]  Was it dab ray?
[46:16.630 --> 46:17.630]  Was that the name of it?
[46:17.630 --> 46:19.230]  Dab right.
[46:19.230 --> 46:20.070]  Oh, dab right.
[46:20.070 --> 46:21.990]  Dab right.
[46:21.990 --> 46:23.390]  Here, give me, I'll pull it up.
[46:23.390 --> 46:24.230]  Hold on.
[46:28.510 --> 46:32.230]  Hopefully I didn't just moon everybody on the video here.
[46:32.230 --> 46:33.270]  Dab right, yeah.
[46:37.230 --> 46:38.230]  Looks like this.
[46:42.310 --> 46:43.150]  Yeah.
[46:46.820 --> 46:48.700]  Got a little holder for the carb cap.
[46:49.780 --> 46:51.340]  Silicone.
[46:51.340 --> 46:53.940]  The coolest part about it is like when you do set
[46:53.940 --> 46:55.460]  the temperature that you really like.
[46:55.460 --> 46:58.780]  So like, say you like 590 or 690 or something,
[46:58.780 --> 47:02.940]  whatever it is, you can actually put your desired temperature
[47:02.940 --> 47:07.260]  in there and then you can set it to just making it flash
[47:07.260 --> 47:10.420]  color, or you can set it to making it flash
[47:10.420 --> 47:13.220]  and having an alarm, an audio alarm on it,
[47:13.220 --> 47:15.140]  which I like because.
[47:16.700 --> 47:18.740]  You space out.
[47:18.740 --> 47:20.580]  Yeah, yeah.
[47:20.580 --> 47:21.700]  Yeah.
[47:21.700 --> 47:23.740]  So it's got an alarm on it.
[47:23.740 --> 47:24.580]  It's cool.
[47:24.580 --> 47:27.180]  Just quickly, this is their Instagram.
[47:28.660 --> 47:32.140]  You showing on my phone anyways, it's like,
[47:32.140 --> 47:34.340]  I can't, there's no way I could possibly see that.
[47:34.340 --> 47:35.540]  I don't know.
[47:35.540 --> 47:37.300]  Maybe other people see it better than me,
[47:37.300 --> 47:38.900]  but that's tiny.
[47:40.340 --> 47:42.260]  I'll write their username in the chat.
[47:52.630 --> 47:54.710]  And I believe the other person we mentioned
[47:54.710 --> 47:56.390]  was Dogman Truth.
[47:58.470 --> 48:01.710]  And that's T-R-O-O-P, right?
[48:01.710 --> 48:03.470]  Yeah, I think.
[48:04.870 --> 48:07.310]  Dogman, T-R-O-O-P, yep.
[48:07.310 --> 48:08.510]  Whoa, shit.
[48:08.510 --> 48:09.350]  That's shiny.
[48:13.030 --> 48:14.190]  My headset's down.
[48:18.140 --> 48:20.180]  I'm smoking good.
[48:20.180 --> 48:22.340]  I'm just looking down at all my blessings.
[48:23.940 --> 48:25.860]  Your cornucopia.
[48:25.860 --> 48:27.260]  I feel that way sometimes.
[48:28.220 --> 48:32.460]  I definitely feel blessed with the samples
[48:32.460 --> 48:34.100]  that I get access to.
[48:34.100 --> 48:37.580]  But at the same time, I got into the cannabis industry
[48:37.580 --> 48:39.740]  in order to have enough to smoke.
[48:39.740 --> 48:42.460]  I started as a patient like so many other people.
[48:42.460 --> 48:44.740]  Yeah, yeah, 100%.
[48:44.740 --> 48:45.980]  Yeah, I mean, shit.
[48:45.980 --> 48:48.540]  I'm looking at a bunch of things that I purchased myself
[48:48.540 --> 48:50.060]  because I love to smoke.
[48:51.100 --> 48:53.780]  What have been some of your purchases lately then?
[48:53.780 --> 48:56.060]  If you don't mind sharing some of them.
[48:56.100 --> 48:56.940]  I don't know.
[48:56.940 --> 49:00.380]  I'm a split smoker, so I really like flowers.
[49:00.380 --> 49:01.660]  Oh, here, I was looking for this.
[49:01.660 --> 49:05.300]  This bonkers is fucking bonkers.
[49:05.300 --> 49:06.540]  It's fucking bonkers.
[49:06.540 --> 49:08.620]  I don't even know how to show it off right now
[49:08.620 --> 49:12.020]  and show it justice on the thing, on the camera here.
[49:12.020 --> 49:12.860]  Hold on, hold on.
[49:12.860 --> 49:14.620]  Let me get at least a prettier piece.
[49:17.820 --> 49:21.060]  This is bred by what, Exotic Genetics Mike,
[49:21.060 --> 49:25.820]  and it's cookies and cream times lemon tree.
[49:26.500 --> 49:27.900]  Grown by Mr. Dank.
[49:29.780 --> 49:30.620]  Stupid fire.
[49:32.100 --> 49:33.140]  Stupid, stupid fire.
[49:33.140 --> 49:34.260]  Ooh.
[49:34.260 --> 49:36.860]  Like creamy lemons and gas.
[49:39.100 --> 49:41.380]  Yeah, that one's really good.
[49:41.380 --> 49:43.340]  Creamy lemon and gas.
[49:43.340 --> 49:47.660]  I feel like when you describe something,
[49:47.660 --> 49:48.620]  it's like three words.
[49:48.620 --> 49:52.780]  Like the pretzels was like citrus, grape, and candy.
[49:53.540 --> 49:56.940]  Different sections of the tongue are watering.
[49:56.940 --> 50:00.540]  I think I like complex flavors too, yeah.
[50:01.740 --> 50:05.420]  Well, I imagine as a hash maker, that's what's inspiring
[50:05.420 --> 50:06.860]  because you want to be able to preserve
[50:06.860 --> 50:08.860]  that complex flavor structure.
[50:09.860 --> 50:10.700]  Yeah, yeah.
[50:10.700 --> 50:12.100]  And the sour banana sherbet,
[50:12.100 --> 50:15.180]  this Fino is more floral than the Fino
[50:15.180 --> 50:17.460]  that I've washed in the past,
[50:17.460 --> 50:21.660]  but it still has a very creamy banana smell to it.
[50:23.380 --> 50:25.780]  I've washed a Fino that's not as floral,
[50:25.780 --> 50:29.260]  that has way more of the banana and cream smell to it,
[50:29.260 --> 50:30.860]  and that one yields bigger.
[50:30.860 --> 50:32.780]  So any hash makers out there,
[50:32.780 --> 50:34.780]  popping beans of sour banana sherbet,
[50:34.780 --> 50:36.180]  looking for the yielder,
[50:36.180 --> 50:38.420]  look for the one that's more banana cream.
[50:38.420 --> 50:40.380]  The one that has more of the floral
[50:40.380 --> 50:44.940]  and sour type hints in it, doesn't yield as good.
[50:44.940 --> 50:46.100]  So yeah.
[50:49.620 --> 50:51.980]  Oh, and then like, I'm even like loving this shit.
[50:52.020 --> 50:55.300]  And this is like more of an old school style hash
[50:55.300 --> 50:56.300]  from Nasha.
[50:57.180 --> 50:59.180]  Oh, I've had Nasha.
[50:59.180 --> 51:00.940]  Pressed old school style hash.
[51:00.940 --> 51:03.500]  I was just hanging out with the brethren up there
[51:03.500 --> 51:05.340]  and up north.
[51:05.340 --> 51:09.380]  And this is blood diamond OG, and it's just gassy.
[51:09.380 --> 51:11.740]  It smells like gas and earth.
[51:11.740 --> 51:13.820]  I don't know, I like a little of everything.
[51:15.460 --> 51:18.460]  Not the prettiest hash, but it tastes amazing in a split.
[51:20.860 --> 51:22.940]  Oh, look, I didn't have, yeah, some left.
[51:22.940 --> 51:25.860]  Can you talk about Baron as a hash maker?
[51:27.780 --> 51:29.260]  Like talk about Nasha.
[51:33.720 --> 51:37.120]  They do things a little bit more classic style.
[51:38.800 --> 51:43.200]  Most of their granular hash is not like super melty.
[51:43.200 --> 51:45.360]  It's very stable.
[51:45.360 --> 51:47.640]  The stuff that I've seen, you know,
[51:47.640 --> 51:50.640]  some of it's, you know, meltier than others.
[51:51.240 --> 51:53.440]  And then they basically have a granular side
[51:53.440 --> 51:55.720]  of their products and a press side.
[51:55.720 --> 51:58.400]  And their press side is not rosin,
[51:58.400 --> 52:00.720]  although they might be doing some of that in the future.
[52:00.720 --> 52:04.200]  Their press side is more like temple balls
[52:04.200 --> 52:07.080]  and classic style hash to put in a chillum,
[52:07.080 --> 52:10.520]  to put in a spliff, to put on top of a bowl,
[52:10.520 --> 52:12.640]  to put in your joint, to put in your blunt,
[52:12.640 --> 52:15.640]  that type of hash rather than to dab.
[52:20.660 --> 52:22.420]  So a while ago,
[52:25.220 --> 52:27.980]  the stock sacrament asked,
[52:27.980 --> 52:31.820]  are there any kind of OG Finos cuts you still keep around
[52:31.820 --> 52:36.820]  and how you swing it, keeping so busy with everything else?
[52:37.140 --> 52:38.340]  Keep them all around.
[52:38.340 --> 52:41.100]  It's all about having a fucking beautiful family
[52:41.100 --> 52:44.980]  and keeping your connections strong.
[52:44.980 --> 52:47.820]  You know, I keep all those original OG cuts around.
[52:48.180 --> 52:49.740]  If you're talking about some of those things
[52:49.740 --> 52:54.460]  that we brought from LA to fucking Colorado,
[52:54.460 --> 52:56.540]  you know, some of those first OGs
[52:56.540 --> 52:58.020]  to really hit shells out here.
[52:59.660 --> 53:01.740]  I had a Skywalker cut.
[53:01.740 --> 53:04.140]  I had a 91 OG cut.
[53:04.140 --> 53:07.420]  I had a Coal Creek Kush cut.
[53:07.420 --> 53:10.740]  And, you know, people oftentimes are like, you know,
[53:10.740 --> 53:12.780]  say like Nicotine Coal Creek Kush.
[53:12.780 --> 53:15.620]  You put my name on cuts that floated around here
[53:15.620 --> 53:17.220]  just because I kept them for so long.
[53:18.020 --> 53:20.620]  In no way, shape or form do I put my name
[53:20.620 --> 53:22.500]  on any fucking cuts.
[53:22.500 --> 53:24.420]  They were all given to me by fucking people
[53:24.420 --> 53:28.060]  I highly, highly look up to, mentors of mine.
[53:28.060 --> 53:30.900]  You know, I got the Ghost OG from my brethren Rich
[53:30.900 --> 53:32.220]  and Baso Organic.
[53:34.060 --> 53:37.740]  You know, the Coal Creek Kush came from Brad, 710.
[53:37.740 --> 53:39.780]  We actually made a trade way back in the day.
[53:39.780 --> 53:41.940]  I gave him a Blue Dream cut that yielded
[53:41.940 --> 53:44.180]  over two and a half pounds of light.
[53:44.180 --> 53:46.460]  And he gave me that Coal Creek Kush
[53:46.500 --> 53:48.380]  in exchange, because back then Blue Dream
[53:48.380 --> 53:50.780]  wasn't really watered down like it is today.
[53:50.780 --> 53:52.900]  And finding a strain that yielded that, you know,
[53:52.900 --> 53:55.820]  well, and people wanted that flower.
[53:55.820 --> 53:58.100]  It was a good trade for both of us back then.
[54:00.500 --> 54:02.500]  Shit, there's so many other cuts.
[54:02.500 --> 54:07.500]  SFV OG, the Hells OG that we ran for years,
[54:08.380 --> 54:12.700]  fucking all the planetary OGs that came from my brethren,
[54:12.700 --> 54:14.620]  Johnny, OG Genetics.
[54:14.620 --> 54:18.060]  He was one of the dudes that first got proper, proper OGs
[54:18.060 --> 54:21.060]  into my hands, which then in turn got them
[54:21.060 --> 54:22.780]  into Colorado's hands, you know.
[54:23.780 --> 54:26.420]  There were some people that I have to big up,
[54:26.420 --> 54:31.420]  like man like Scott Reach, man like Richie and Baso Organic,
[54:31.460 --> 54:33.420]  because these were some of the first people,
[54:33.420 --> 54:35.860]  Fletcher from Archive C Bank.
[54:35.860 --> 54:37.300]  These were some of the first people
[54:37.300 --> 54:40.220]  to really bring OG Kush to Colorado.
[54:41.100 --> 54:44.540]  And once I, you know, I'm a Cali boy, you know,
[54:44.540 --> 54:47.620]  we had 20 different Finos of OG Kush on the shelf
[54:47.620 --> 54:52.620]  in Studio City or whatever for years, you know.
[54:53.060 --> 54:56.180]  But Colorado just takes a little bit longer to catch on.
[54:56.180 --> 55:00.540]  Scott, Rich, Fletch, and there were a few others,
[55:00.540 --> 55:03.300]  were some of the first to really cultivate OG Kush
[55:03.300 --> 55:04.500]  out here in Colorado.
[55:05.540 --> 55:09.100]  And, you know, I was blessed to get some of those cuts
[55:09.100 --> 55:12.060]  from those guys, and then also from Johnny,
[55:12.060 --> 55:13.900]  and just to, you know, cultivate my own
[55:13.900 --> 55:16.100]  for the last decade out here.
[55:16.100 --> 55:17.900]  People always want to talk about OG,
[55:17.900 --> 55:20.540]  because it's one of those rare strains.
[55:20.540 --> 55:24.020]  I still want to smoke it every single day of my life.
[55:24.940 --> 55:26.300]  It's not a big yielder.
[55:26.300 --> 55:28.020]  It doesn't make the best hash.
[55:28.020 --> 55:29.500]  It's always a little darker.
[55:29.500 --> 55:31.740]  It doesn't yield the highest in hash.
[55:31.740 --> 55:35.420]  It tastes amazing, but you know, so it's rare.
[55:35.420 --> 55:38.740]  OG's always going to be OG.
[55:39.420 --> 55:40.700]  OG to me, OG is original.
[55:40.700 --> 55:41.940]  Doesn't stand for ocean grown.
[55:41.940 --> 55:43.580]  Doesn't stand for gangster.
[55:43.580 --> 55:44.740]  Stands for original.
[55:47.460 --> 55:51.020]  I remember seeing some boots in Emerald Cup
[55:51.020 --> 55:53.420]  that were like ocean grown, and some that were,
[55:53.420 --> 55:55.100]  everyone had a different definition,
[55:55.100 --> 56:00.100]  and it was a funny microcosm of the culture at large.
[56:03.140 --> 56:05.700]  Yo, guys, I'm sorry, but I'm tired.
[56:05.700 --> 56:06.540]  Me too.
[56:06.540 --> 56:08.580]  I've been like rushing out around now.
[56:09.420 --> 56:11.060]  It's been a long, long week.
[56:11.060 --> 56:11.900]  No worries.
[56:11.900 --> 56:13.420]  I feel like I'm fading.
[56:13.420 --> 56:15.340]  And we'll see you again.
[56:15.340 --> 56:18.220]  So I think it's next Saturday night, right?
[56:19.020 --> 56:20.180]  I guess that is, yeah.
[56:20.180 --> 56:21.980]  I think I'm booked again, yeah.
[56:21.980 --> 56:25.740]  And just quickly tell everybody who's coming on with you.
[56:27.180 --> 56:29.540]  Oh, my brethren, Genome Alchemy.
[56:29.540 --> 56:31.420]  Check for my brethren, Genome Alchemy.
[56:31.420 --> 56:33.060]  He's one of my favorite breeders.
[56:33.060 --> 56:36.100]  We've done work together for a long, long time.
[56:37.100 --> 56:39.740]  Check him on Instagram if you haven't already.
[56:39.740 --> 56:41.820]  He's super humble.
[56:42.740 --> 56:47.740]  And we've been like best friends and housemates
[56:48.340 --> 56:53.260]  and worked together for like almost 20 years now.
[56:53.260 --> 56:55.980]  And to like tell somebody that you've been friends with him
[56:55.980 --> 56:58.420]  and you lived with him and you're still friends with him
[56:58.420 --> 57:00.620]  after living with him, it's, you know, it's saying something.
[57:00.620 --> 57:05.460]  So pick up Genome Alchemy on all his works.
[57:06.980 --> 57:08.260]  Always steady grinding.
[57:09.860 --> 57:13.380]  And so just quickly, I think,
[57:13.380 --> 57:15.660]  for those of you watching earlier tonight,
[57:17.140 --> 57:22.140]  tomorrow we're talking IPM and genetics
[57:22.340 --> 57:24.980]  and tissue culture and stuff like that.
[57:26.300 --> 57:27.500]  God, what time zone?
[57:27.500 --> 57:31.500]  At six o'clock Pacific time.
[57:31.500 --> 57:34.660]  And then Sunday morning, I saw James being in the chat.
[57:34.660 --> 57:35.900]  He'll be on.
[57:36.700 --> 57:40.460]  That's 11 a.m. Sunday Pacific time
[57:40.460 --> 57:43.220]  with Adam Dunn and James Loud.
[57:43.220 --> 57:48.220]  And we also have Marlon Asher on with those guys.
[57:48.500 --> 57:53.500]  So should be a good brunch time conversation.
[57:54.460 --> 57:56.540]  Maybe I'll even bring my mom to...
[57:59.100 --> 58:01.100]  I'll pull my mom in.
[58:01.140 --> 58:06.140]  But anyway, Nick, thanks for being a sport.
[58:06.740 --> 58:07.580]  Yeah.
[58:07.580 --> 58:10.540]  Thank you so much for coming on and sharing with us.
[58:10.540 --> 58:11.380]  For sure, for sure.
[58:11.380 --> 58:13.860]  Next time maybe we'll time it to where I'm like on a farm
[58:13.860 --> 58:15.500]  or at the lab or something.
[58:15.500 --> 58:16.780]  Yeah.
[58:16.780 --> 58:19.340]  Or in front of the turntables.
[58:19.340 --> 58:21.300]  Yeah, I mean, can I switch my screen?
[58:21.300 --> 58:23.060]  They're right here, look.
[58:23.060 --> 58:26.060]  I didn't realize I could switch my screen the whole time.
[58:26.060 --> 58:27.460]  They're so close.
[58:28.420 --> 58:31.020]  You could just walk over there and start playing.
[58:32.580 --> 58:34.340]  You could blow everyone's mind.
[58:34.340 --> 58:36.820]  That's how I should have shown the fucking weed off.
[58:36.820 --> 58:37.660]  If I switch the screen.
[58:37.660 --> 58:38.580]  Just turn it around.
[58:38.580 --> 58:42.060]  Oh yeah, I would have given a better...
[58:42.060 --> 58:43.460]  Lessons learned.
[58:43.460 --> 58:44.300]  I really did.
[58:45.180 --> 58:46.020]  Zoom flip.
[58:46.940 --> 58:49.060]  So to our family, give thanks for having me.
[58:49.060 --> 58:52.980]  And to everyone from Boston, it's a happy, happy night.
[58:53.860 --> 58:56.500]  So anyway, we'll see some of you tomorrow.
[58:56.500 --> 58:57.580]  Thank you everyone.
[58:57.580 --> 58:59.860]  And with that, I will kill the live stream.
