And hello everybody back in our lives collapsing the universe simulcasting on
FCPO2's we're having a good time tonight how you guys doing? Chat everybody
watching on the replay I hope you're in or I hope you're fully clothed how about
that you don't even need to be fully clothed to watch your show do you guys
everybody raise their hands I know I know I just wear shirts this is how
we're doing it yes no we're back for another scene collectors episode which
is always a really fun episode for me and I think for a lot of people out
there too because we all kind of have this passion and this hobby for
collecting different things and this plant is no different so we've we're
kind of expanding on everything tonight we've got a three-way throwdown so we're
adding in another guest to the mix we're also going to be talking about
collectibles too because there's a lot of people you know seeds aren't the only
cannabis related thing that you can collect and so we wanted to get into
that and highlight some of those things got some great guests for that let me go
through the order though right now mr. magpie is calling it I see him in chat
mr. root beer himself Dave's not there man how you doing tonight Dave I am
superb thank you for having me once again always a pleasure to show off the
collection oh man I appreciate you coming it's always a fun conversation
you always have you know new material and that's again just when you thought
it was gonna end with Dave he's been a busy guy so we'll get into that and we
also jolly can are kind genetics we've got you up in the corner I'm not quite
sure where you are on the YouTube page but we've talked you've been on my shows
before you were on the home grow show and we kind of talked you said hey buddy
I collect seeds too you sent me a picture and I was like yes you do collect
seeds don't you so how you doing tonight good times yeah indeed and you
were we were just talking you were in the river swimming earlier right pretty
good yeah yeah it sounds like a fun way to spend the day it's all I have to do
is walk outside yes I got a relay between headphones if you're watching it
on YouTube maybe turn YouTube audio off because YouTube usually is a little bit
behind what we're currently talking about you know just in case somebody
says fuck or something and you wanted to enter the beep or something I don't know
that's my guess yeah I can be a good worker yeah the river is epic you know
listen old and crisp spoken the Hawaiian bubble berry nice actually I've
had a chance to try that Hawaiian bubble berry and I liked it I was impressed and
they have a few of those seeds here myself
awesome yeah and and down yeah I'm tripping out it's been cheering for
almost a year now and I like a long cheer yeah yours definitely a long cure
but you know some people say that weed goes bad if it's not stored right yeah
but I I have some stuff that I've had for two years comes out of the jar
smells tastes still hits good so yeah probably some truth to it but also
probably not as much truth to it but let's go down to the the icon down there
everybody knows him and loves him he is the American one and that you know it's
somebody that I've been watching and seeing and following for a long time in
this community and this guy has got some awesome collections of things not to
mention his own work so we brought him on tonight please say hello to everybody
hello Chad Dave Charlie can everyone in chat I'm the American one and yeah I
love cannabis I've been growing a long time and it's good to be here good good
yeah thank you no thank you for joining and you know you will have some exciting
announcements soon I'll let you do that when the time is right but buddy yeah
very cool yeah definitely well let's let's get into the collection I'm going
to ignore Dave right now because he's just not playing fair I'm going to the
first collectible of the night I'm calling it out I'm calling out with the
t-shirt now everybody might see that design on there they're kind of looking
at they're like oh you know that kind of is like the you know the Twin Peaks owl
it is as one of my original kind of logos there but somebody in the
community that we all know and on this channel or likes to watch this channel
comment this channel made this is st. Bernard's observation booth so stbob I
consider this a cannabis collectible he makes some pretty badass tie-dyes and he
made this one for me so big shout out to him I appreciate that it keeps me from
being on the show naked tonight which as we discussed earlier is appreciated
thank you thank you say about yes yes yes okay so now now now I will recognize
Dave let's let's go up to Dave what do you got there buddy oh I've been I've
been busy I've been collecting I've got some new Duke diamond here some old
Dominion seed company the burnout can skunk band B2 I got some of the the
latest drop from a mean gene that you could actually get you know that the
public could actually get their hands on right some of the this that's what so
it's so hard to get you get your hands on some of that stuff but you've got the
the bubble kush gelato 33 cherry limeade the sourdough lime 5 the the
special freebie which is awesome the skylights f1 the TK and L5 Hayes the
sky color double cush f3 now now when you say you know they're there they were
available to the public you know I kind of asked you this last time is I know
that you have to be fast on these types of things you recommended you know just
kind of follow breeders on Instagram because a lot of them may not have a
website where did you find these or how did you know about this one when that
the drop was coming what clued me into it was like you said Instagram following
the following mean gene himself he clued you into which seed company was was
dropping this and so I followed that seed company and then waited for the
drop and boom boom scooped them up cool you might they might even still be
available because it's not I don't think enough people were knew about it
or maybe they even actually had enough supply that could be part of it too
yeah that's always nice to a lot of these times things are limited now do
you guys you know who here sees like multiple runs of things because you know
unless it's like a sour diesel or you know in Northern Lights a lot of these
seem to be kind of one and done's I don't know do you guys see a lot of
repeated year after year oh I can go get that same pack of you know the hot
new again generally no if it's an old classic like you said like a Northern
Lights a triangle cush something that's been around for a while you could see
those because those will make their way into things but other stuff it might be
a one-off unless it's unless it's actually a legitimately really good you
know something like a like a black lime reserve that's gonna be around for a
long time and gonna consistently be around for a long time right right and
you know yeah things probably get a little bit refined to or people keep
working on them so we got here DNA what was these are all one-offs this is their
limited collectibles okay there's 500 per pack or per you know strain and then
and that's when the tree that one's a pretty hard one to get there's some
years of trying to get that one the truth yeah big up mr. trees for sure
he's definitely somebody that we've had on here and you know DNA like DNA is one
of those weird like touchy subjects right now like you know I've got my my
DNA stickers here that I love and I've got my poster in there they're they're
kind of not on the on the popular list right now because of their stance in
Michigan but I don't think anybody can deny that DNA makes fire genetics but
with with that we just gotta get this in hey MCMA oh yeah that's in Michigan and
I'm actually using it really appropriately I was topping earlier and
I'm like what can I stuff them in here so hey MCMA backside backside has the
message though okay yeah quit quit trying to take away patients rights but
DNA again they're unpopular because they're supporting the MCMA but they
make freaking fire genetics have you popped any of those jolly any of those
one-off DNA's yeah I did PCK and sour crypt and the 91 crypt and they were all
you know old-school crypt but PCK came out with the highlights you know like if
you pull up the picture of PCK like it had it looked like the picture with the
sweet highlights and it only comes out in a cold Fino you know it's got to be
real cold to pull the deep blues and there's like a yellow or something maybe
nice nice that's one thing you know we always like to hear about and see too is
just you know when people are popping them because you know I saw somebody you
know somebody in chat you know ganja cat seeds worthless until you pop it some
truth to that but then again there's also a great resale market but I like I
like popping things and I'll maybe grab my little tray of babies right now I did
pop on the New Year's yeah how about did any of you guys pop anything on the
New Year's or full moon tonight last night recently you guys popped anything
recently no I haven't popped anything recently I let somebody else go okay my
most recent new ones were OG choco tie-up fives they were labeled from a KB
brains and and before that I had acquired some chocolate beans from DNA
okay cuz you're on the chocolate now yeah I want to try and find some choco
flavors and hopefully make a whole bunch of beans so with some chocolate in it
but we'll see how that goes so I had two chocolates that ended up working out
because it was all femme seed so and the first one really wasn't that impressive
that it made more it made a better plant more chunks and better structure
but the second one that was a little stretch here was killer so I was really
first I was disappointed in my car I mean it's gonna be like some regular but
then the second one was more impressive so I'm glad about that but yeah I am I
like I was telling you Chad I'm kind of a reformed seed collector and I am of
the notion that fuck collecting I'm still popping them all baby yeah I'm at
the point of I should almost like close the doors fucking good problem to have
right you know I wish I wish I could pop more I wish I could run more I'm gonna
be busy for a while and that's actually one thing that we will do later in the
show tonight kazoo cush let's see if I could do this here he sent me out I got
a whole bunch of a whole bunches here and definitely more than I can get to
myself and I hit him up before the show I said hey kazoo would you mind if I did
a couple giveaways and give out some beans so we will be doing that later in
the show cool us only I'm sorry guys I feel you looking at me mr. magpie yeah
well do you as only on that but we'll do some giveaways as we get into later in
the show wanna wanna keep rolling here and Jolly's going rapid-fire on us down
there he's I'm loving it though it's a great collection he's got I know I know
let's see here why don't why don't you pick up a couple packs that you want to
tell us about from down there Jolly and give us give us a little story of maybe
how you came about them or why you selected them was it the breeder was it
the strain pretty package what was it that made you pick a couple up here well
I'm a strain hunter and I'm looking for like a very specific headspace and it's
usually like something like sober but really high functioning yeah but not
bored you know that I can't get bored and there's like a few companies that
really spoke to me and some dudes like jinx proof like I smoked his nine pound
hammer for over five years straight of just nine pound hammer and like great
strain man yeah I put that in the classic category recent classic but a
classic it's been around long enough and it stood the test of time I recognize
that packaging there and this right here like purple urkel was such an awesome
everyday smokable strain you know yeah and like I love them now I used to hate
them I was super all about rakes and you could like find posts of me just
trashing fems and then I got a freebie from Cali connection of their 818 this
stuff and yeah I changed my mind I was like oh I actually enjoy them but you
know just for the sake of like a one-time grow and smoke yeah I mean they
have a place they definitely have a place for people who you know may be
doing this without approval they don't want to get caught with a bunch of
plants that could be males you may have limited space and you can only plant two
or three seeds and to have two out of three pop up mail on you well that puts
a freaking crimp in your day so feminized gets around that by being
female so yeah time and a place for everything kind of like gross to us and
I see chronic wonder up here he said jinx is a great breeder to support 100%
agree to that he's done great things for me without even knowing it but also just
the the character of that guy so excellent person to support their jinx
proof genetics I'm a fan there and it looks like Dave you were reloading up
there where what are the shiny ones are these kind of I just put a if my camera
would want to cooperate a little better put up a dome piece which is the GMO
root beer hit with headband okay I'm from skunk tech that's one of the more
recent drops either out there I'm a big fan of his there's a throw that up
there to go look TK what is that triangle cush times chem 91
the candy candy okay well you're still a bastard and you know it kind of makes
me wonder with a lot of these root beer crosses now that we've seen how many
people are actually finding a root beer Fino and then using that to breed with
like I've you know I've only popped to the the burgers and beer right now from
the ranch which is the GMO or Donnie burger times the root beer and of course
I'm hoping to get the root beer turps but it makes me wonder with the speed of
things that are coming out if they're actually finding a root beer Fino and
working with that or if they're just taking whatever comes up and then still
got the root beer name to it right yeah that's a good question I would imagine a
lot of these seeds that are coming out now we're probably along those lines of
hey I just popped it because it had their root beer name I haven't I haven't
even popped any of the root beers I've only run some cuts that I that have the
root beer okay well that's and they definitely have that that profile it's
like a sweet sticky it's almost like you you poured a Pepsi or coca-cola on the
ground in the summertime and let it kind of sit around and dry up a little bit
get real sticky that's what it reminds me of it's so unique and this little
little hint of acetone on the back end it's delicious that's a great descriptor
I know exactly what that smells like that's kind of cool if you ever hung
outside McDonald's no yes you know what that smell is so that's cool and you get
the the katsu up there as well which yeah that that is one that just recently
came to my possession it's the black lime reserve an original og I don't
think that was ever really massively released I happen to win a little auction
over on cats who's discord which there's another option out there to get seeds
there's just so many options out there nowadays it's fine people on discord
that's cool that's you know that's one platform that I haven't quite jumped on
yet actually I don't want to I don't think I will just because like there's a
lot of cool things to do over there I got time management issues as it is so
would be here see here I noticed that you also had the skunk band and skunk
well first of all I'm noticing it because it's the the Duke diamond you
know the brand their Dominion seed company so that immediately grabs my
attention but again I love how he look at this information folks he's got the
morphology he actually knows how it grows he smoked it the nutrients yields
lineage all of that stuff I love seeing it it gives me confidence in the fact
that they have been grown out they have been selected have you grown any of these
skunks from Duke diamond or Dominion seed company yet Dave because there's a
variety there are a few there are a few I it's another one that it's I always
have plans I'm gonna run this next I'm gonna run this next and then I get
something else I'm gonna run this next and then it just gets further down the
line and then I grab a cut from someone and then oh hey can you test this for me
and it's just oh so I I think I'm gonna just stop testing for people and be like
listen I'm gonna run what I want to run now right right right yeah no I feel you
that's a constant battle you think you have your next seed run figured out
ready to pop and then something comes in the door and you're like oh how am I
gonna do that so let's see here Jolly you were you were talking there in chat
you had something you wanted to or we're gonna show there yes so like a big thing
with strain hunting and stuff is content ability and only certain strains
are like is somebody able to keep content at like 10 pounds of smoke in it
and not every strain is that some of them are like a great couple of weeks
some of them are just an awesome one-time smoke and then for some reason
it's like people's minds just get used to it and a lot of us smokers I think
are looking to explore different like zones of our ourselves and each strain
has like its own shine on our personality yeah you know like so for
speaking of I guess personality wise maybe what what is one of the breeders
that you have in front of you that maybe it was their personality you resonated
with so you're like you know what that's a good dude I'm gonna try some of
their gear oh wow yeah this dude right here professor pot grower at Big Island
genetics this is his diesel 50 pack the breeder and he won a sweet battle smoking
this you know like against Johnny Law and they were really going after him and
like he's really really intelligent and I heard about him from another person
that I knew and I didn't know it was him and they were talking about him and his
battles and stuff and I was like wait a second like you're this guy that I heard
about from this guy like this long ago like and I'm getting to do your gear and
is it was awesome man because these are like some people really hate on some of
these selections like this is the real kawaii electric like you may not know
the genome expression and everything like that to get the as described quite
electric but I mean it was just an awesome experience for me and as
somebody who gets like migraine headaches and stuff it was really helpful
and that was one of the reasons why I chose it in my my projects but I did
alternate genome expressions because I have the the real cut kawaii electric but I am
reluctant to release the seeds you know or anything like that because I just I
love it so much and my whole life I was trying to get the real cuts from dudes
and it was like impossible it would always be something else like it wasn't
purple oracle you know it wasn't nine pound hammer it was like one like
molecule off or something and it's super sad because it's not the same experience
but then in the pheno like a breeder can take something and it can express really
well in their pheno like they grow stimulus and the temperatures and stuff
that they got going on at their place and even if they test it out like it
doesn't mean that your pheno at your place is gonna pop in that zone to get
what I was talking about for a while for the the golden ratio on the strains like
I think I got some UK cheese from Humboldt CSI somewhere nice yeah and so
like the UK cheese is a super amazing plant all by itself and yeah there it is
but if it doesn't you know like you're smoking real UK cheese you know that
you're smoking real UK cheese because you're like able to joke about and have
like a really good time in my opinion versus like some of these other strains
I got here which are gonna just zonk me out and make it sound like useless you
know I'm on a dopamine vacation well that's you know that's why I like
variety in my grow and I think that's why a lot of people like variety in
their grow just because yeah you know there there are stuff that I'll
specifically go to at night there's stuff I'll specifically go to in the day
and you know I'll interchange them my body doesn't really recognize you know
indica sativa everything is kind of a hybrid to my body but there's still
there's still ones that I prefer in the evening and ones I prefer in the daytime
I mean you have the Dutchess cut right like the real Jordan of the Islands
winter cut of that tree yes and actually dude I've got here's here's your seed
pack that's coming your seed pack is is partially loaded already but I've been
I have all I have these other ones and these are these are old they're like six
seven years old I basically have just been dropping stuff in water to see
what's gonna have a decent germination rate and then I'm just gonna give those
all out but like these these packs here I'm not getting a good enough
germination rate that I want to give them to everybody so that's why things
are a little bit slow to get awesome get there but yeah the seed packs that's my
seed pack coming I can't wait coming to a thing near you but yeah they'll be the
Dutch treat crosses that I've done in there that's something I'm proud of and
some of the original you did that with the Duchess like that was the mom yeah
oh my gosh so that'll be that'll be ridiculous that'll be I'll be stoked to
get that into your hands because I know you know just from talking your
explanation what that strain does for you
medicinally so fuck yeah dude I'm happy to do that
Aladdin's lamp a whole new world right there okay let's distract ourself with
Dave now I recognize that logo in the upper left hand corner so I know there
was a recent drop or a box a special thing what are we looking at here Dave
you might be looking at some of the contents of that special box everybody
loves a little box from now on every now and then you know yes but yes you've got
the black list was not in the box the Topanga sassafras was the cookie Cola
was in the box the Derby V2 was in the box the Derby the Kentucky iced tea and
the root beer and pan of our in the box and all of those are specific things hit
with the root beer Coca-Cola root beer mail those are all those fancy new hype
drop that's out there so we'll see if any of them live up to the hype but I
have faith that uh that they will especially that black lime Cola yeah I've
got faith that they'll hold up good I know you're running some of the like the
chocolate Cola and a couple other crosses right now that I keep seeing the
the progress of and they look great and from from your reports they smell great
too yeah it's it's heaven when you get in there and take a whiff of them between
the both of them they both carry a very similar smell it's the the chocolate
Cola and the slushy beer the chocolate Cola's granola funk root beer and I
ninety five the slushy beer is cherry lime it's cherry lime slushy here's
granola funk root beer in there and I believe that's it I'm pretty sure that's
what it was that's awesome and that's so awesome too because I love kazoo cuz
she's awesome he's fun he's wacky he does some things that make me just go
what are you doing buddy smile ear-to-ear but uh no I just saw that
you had a sassafras there and for the longest time as I dropped these well at
least for the last few months I I know that he keeps like tagging Mendocino
gene in in his posts and he's talking about ass turps and a lot of the bags
that he sent me you know it's like this one it's the blueberry assafras so I'm
like now I know where now I know where this is all coming I thought it was
coming from that but yeah there's a lot of assafras primal assafras right here
and actually when I talked to him he is more than happy to communicate and fill
everybody in on some of the lineage stuff so whatever you win tonight he'll
be able to answer some questions but like black mango assafras I just I love
I love the assafras he's definitely got all the ass turps on lockdown yes yeah
he's working for the ass turps so we'll spread that would not have turned out
that was not a good sentence
sweat yeah this is from Jordan of the islands like he's one of my favorite
breeders I'm not sure if he grows organic but for some reason like his
genetics express well you know and I've always been like oh like if they don't
grow organic like it doesn't express the same but his are amazing so he must
just have like awesome genetic stability or something like that yeah definitely
especially in that strain I mean I picked this up ten years ago so and and
it wasn't new at the time so it's had a lot of time to be worked I think
Jody Dutch tree and you know I and I don't know if he was growing outdoors I
don't know where he is anymore but before it was up you know Vancouver
Island that is not a warm outdoor growing climate so I'd imagine he was
indoors but you do a lot of the outdoor cultivation yeah but I'm all about my
tarp if I can get it up like you can tell the difference between one of my
tarp grows and one of my own tarp grows really easily by the cough okay so we're
we're gonna put you on the spot Dave you can only pick two to pop out of those
packs which ones are getting popped first and why I'm gonna say right off
the bat the black lime coal is in the pop that's just it's got to one
legendary and one modern hype legend and I would say the other probably the
Topanga Sassafras just because the Topanga pure cush is just a classic okay
okay that's a good call I don't have it here it was from South Bay genetics but
as a Topanga Canyon I know I showed it on one of the one of the previous shows
and that was with the Topanga what is it is it Topanga something that comes
from like the jungle boys is that kind of where the Topanga thing started or am
I totally Korean Topanga what's that Korean Topanga is that like a boy meets
world okay I'm more of the Wonder Years generation like if you said Fred and
Winnie I would have been like Wonder Years bro oh yeah but he was hilarious
in the grinder grinder now isn't that a dating app it is I heard that there's a
lot of success if you swing that way but the grinder is one of the most hilarious
TV comedies that and Chris Trager this guy has not had cable for a while oh
I'm sorry sorry
let's let's he hasn't even spoke so let's let's let it know every oh shit
he's totally there serious seeds Wow
Cali mist so these two chicks I know went to Amsterdam and I gave him a whole
list of what I wanted and they didn't get me anything I wanted but they ended
up bringing back to this Cali mist so I don't know why my my camera is like
turned yeah they're usually like mirrored or it's weird it's like left is
right right is left it's like you're driving a ship which I can never do in
any case yeah so I'd yeah actually that's the proper yeah that's proper
that's right this is called legend ultimate indica from legend seeds
scenes sensei seed packs man those are like golden tickets right there and the
fact that it's a skunk number one like that the packaging alone just says like
yeah I'm not the new stock and then this was one of my favorite is plants I
grew outside a Nigerian 99 which was from Afro kids were defunct now but that
was a Nigerian by Cinderella 99 and that thing outside just was unbelievable and
then grow super big yeah it was big and chunky and smelled like mangoes it was
really good and then here's some that I ordered from mark emory seed direct
tonight and that's how they come packaged in that little thing you know
they put a little cotton in between them yeah it's so brilliant that's like
that's the corrugated plastic that yeah sometimes you'd use to build greenhouses
to be honest my options they have a big bud bubblegum mango Swiss miss ak-47 and
I don't know what that bby by fruity bud was but that was Jordan of the islands
and by the way I like Jordan of the islands too I think he has some really
good shit and there was another another order I reuse that what I wrote over
some of the stuff but yeah okay the other side it was
marks mix marks outdoor mix Wow Siva by Nirvana and I can't read with them Oh
Durban boys and by Nirvana and you grew these out right you grew a lot of them
yeah yeah that's awesome and that's that's actually something that you know
I think that's a golden nugget right there for anybody who's like trying to
ship seeds these days oh yeah that corrugated stuff right there because
I've gotten I've gotten seeds that have been smashed before and they're in those
little plastic vials but dude if they don't if they get treated as a letter by
the post office they're going through the roller machines and that's just
someone more recently sent me quite a bunch of seeds and this is how they came
in looks like a pop-tart wrapped it in cellophane in case they did the
irradiation and just like that other it's corrugated and put the seeds in
there and put toothpicks in as stoppers and if you can see they're labeled over
here you can barely see yeah yeah very faint yeah I didn't realize that there
was the q-tips were labeled when I pulled them out but yeah that's the way
to do it I've actually in those centrifuges I've sent to overseas like
probably 15 20 times now and with these global stamps in a baby padded envelope
it costs like four bucks to ship overseas it's unbelievable yeah it is
it's nothing it's ridiculous I was just pulling out you know I don't know if you
still offer them but AKB brains is offering the full set of the sense you
see catalog reproductions oh wow hit him up and the reason I got in touch with
him is because I actually had one that he didn't have so I sent it over to him
so he could make more copies of it and send it out but at a time he was
offering like a repose of every single one pretty much that they ever made
and another random but yeah I have a I got seeds from bagu one yeah and I love
the fact that he gives a little tutorial with every order early
identification of sex female male so in the back exactly how to pop them came up
70 degrees and dog plays full tissues in quarters place one tissue in the bottom
of the bowl arrange the seeds on the oh you guys are seeing it yeah I don't know
but anyway I thought that was really cool that we included that with you know
purchase especially for the newbies that was cool that's awesome and we don't you
know we don't get those notes in there a lot now just because again these are for
souvenirs and that's how they're kept so yeah who would be doing something foolish
like getting souvenirs wet and dirty so that's that's why we don't see things
like that but I love that the catalog collection and we'll have to we'll have
to go through we'll have to we'll have to do some catalog collection stuff later
so I pulled a few of my catalogs out that I love to because they're so fun
and I'm glad you know those those seeds the the original the Cali mist you pulled
out from serious seeds you know this is it's so cool because that serious
seeds is one of those like long-term reputable people in the industry for
breeding like solid solid stuff and you know these catalogs are just I think it
was serious seeds warlock let's see here maybe it's even in this one let me yeah
AK-47 first first one here page 8 let's see here yeah so you know they got their
nice pictures of it they've got you know the close-ups kind of how it's growing
and then obviously the text for AK-47 that gives you the story English German
and I have no idea what flag that is yeah this this is probably really recent
I picked it up beginning of 2020 when I went to Amsterdam I was like you know
the kid the kid in the frickin candy store the flyer store you'd go into
shops and you know a lot of the shops will have catalogs like these just
sitting all over and it's like I walked over there like I opened the bag and
just knocked the whole table off into my bag thanks see you later so yeah and
then here's here's another one that I don't see a lot of is just the exotic
seed catalog a lot of people know a lot of people know that stuff spicy bitch so
yeah I love I love catalogs too so that's something that's fun to collect
and it's awesome that you got a lot as well Tao and it's it's fun again to see
some of the older things and how they used to use the describers because you
know some of these catalogs was pre like cannabinoid testing and certainly pre
terpene testing so everything everything's a heavy yielder man it's
just word of mouth you know yeah yeah so let's see I got it looks like we've
got Dave you reloaded on us once again where these oh that's the triangle cush
the s1s loud as loud OG to the og og jar Oh to these are some unreleased mean
jeans that he gifted over to Nick Risdon and they basically Nick gave him
inspectors triangle cush s1s because Jean had he said he always apparently
said he always wanted to run him and Nick gifted him to him and he sent Nick
a whole bunch there's even another one here with the the green apple Fino from
the triangle cush as opposed to the loud OG Fino nice so those are those are
some are high up on the list of I want to run yeah but I have a question for
for tau what year was that a SSSC catalog
the sensei or the super sativa seat you know what I think basically it was just
called the seed bank in 87 and then the super sativa see club was 89 and 90 at
least one of them here and then some just say it's empty seeds on them so
it's a you know they're all different actually as far as sensei and super
steve a seat club they they were two different seed it might have been just a
reincarnation of each one right let's yeah do right so not all from the same
guys but then there's one Oh dropped out I heard I'm kind of getting robotic on
us here so that that might be a good chance we'll do let's do a giveaway here
we're gonna do some regulars and these are testers let's let's go let's go with
okay do ten pack here of the Jurassic a safras which regular seeds sun-grown
inorganic soil it's the Jurassic runs times su pi and these are seeds that
kazoo cush has made and gifted and wants to get out to the community so for a 10
pack of these one you need to be in the US so please us only for this I'm sorry
I feel the shame but the question and it'll be the first person in chat Detroit
River rat 173 okay I'm gonna send you something anyways for that Detroit River
rat I'm writing that down you're getting a 10 pack of one of these cuz 173 and
me groove let's see here let's get this down okay Detroit random 10 okay that's
one pack given away without even having a contest yeah that's awesome okay so
the the trivia question for the 10 pack of Jurassic a safras serious seeds there
is a person's name that is five letters long and starts with s that is commonly
known as the person behind serious seeds so the first person to type that five
letter name into chat you will get the 10 pack of Jurassic a safras there we
go I see it already well get the hair out of the way st. bob st. bernard's
observation booth Simon Simon from serious seeds that is the name I was
looking for so go stbob 10 pack of Jurassic a safras for you sir so thank
you very much and thank you to kazoo kush I will put his IG up here so you
can get a hold of him ask any questions that you want but again this is all
possible because of kazoo so thank you to him and thank you for playing and
we'll be doing more of these so don't worry that was the only only thing we're
doing tonight let's let's go back up to you here jolly it looks like you were
you're playing around you had something there that you're gonna give a give us a
story oh man so I got this tie was given to me by an old-timer and he's really
cool and he said they came from a family in Thailand he would been growing buds
for a long time I can't wait to check this one out maybe people would be
interested it's it's in its pure form so it could be like you know made in a
BX but we also got Nigerian from the same guy and now did he he travel to
acquire these or oh yeah yeah this guy was like a real old-school dude I didn't
even meet him somebody else met him and gave me the gifts that he gave to me and
he also gave me the real Dutch treat cleanse and just awesome guy and you
know thanks yeah that's cool now and have you taken the time to grow many of
those out or any of those out those no they seem yeah to me they seem pretty
damn wild so they're gonna take work to probably get them into something
that I want them to be like but some people are more adventurous than me
yeah there would be like a land race I guess like a something like that you
know like something that's just wildly openly pollinated and for the sake of me
wanting to try like something from this era like this dude was like a real dude
you know from back in the day and he probably knew some of the old-school
legends I don't know if he's still alive or not but you know like I don't know
how to politically correctly say what his career was in his path that that him
and his guidance counselor chose a long time ago but I mean like guys just
awesome and one of those old-school gems that don't really come around that
often yes right one in a million yeah there's we like to call them cores
originals yep and that's another another big island genetics there we had talked
they had a version of Puna butter right because I'm always I'm searching after
the THC version of it they have the call upon a like I don't care what anybody
says like I have gotten the winners like I got the real kawaii electric as
described to me from like verifiable hippie sources and then cross-checked
with descriptions and stuff like that and I got it within three seeds but I
lost the whole pack the last round and only one of them worked but uh that was
my fault yeah it happens sometimes I don't know
Tao have you had some you know experience with these older seed packs
you know you mentioned earlier you like to get everything pop in these days what
what is maybe some of the the older ones and granted I know we've covered this
before with Dave and you reminded me Dave it's like well we never know how
long it was off the plant before we got it but from the day that you got it what
are some of the oldest beans that you've had success popping well that's a good
question I know that had failure with this one that I really wanted that I
actually made myself you know and like yeah I tried first when I you know I
tried and it failed and I'm like you know I really want to make this happen
so I tried everything I saved ten of them yet so we'll see what happens but I
think I think once they're dead they're dead basically I don't know why but I
never tried the tissue culture but like they get infected with something I would
imagine that they're you know infected with something that it probably wouldn't
be making it no matter what I really don't know what the oldest ones but at
some point I'm like I better start now because when that happened then I'm
thinking in my head like how many other ones are not gonna be not gonna go so
you know that's when I was kind of starting me down the rabbit hole I got
to stop buying them and start popping them off yeah yeah I was telling you I'm
like I'm a I'm a what do they call that?
I'm a recovering addict on the seed junkie.
yeah so in the past like two years those are the only
two packs I bought with a chocolate and OG chocolate tie at five so that says
something right there and now that I started making my own like yeah now I
have a whole ton of stuff that I want to try but I even want to try the one that
I made more so now it's like yeah it's like whoever was saying yeah you know
what's on deck until something else comes up right that's what Dave was
saying you know you got something on deck and then something else comes up or
someone talks you into running something or it gives you a cut or
whatever but yeah so my plan is after this chocolate look through I'm gonna
try to find the best girl and female out of that lot and then make a ton of seeds
cuz I like I want to go through a real more population and just you know a few
packs and then I'm gonna start popping beans that I made that I haven't tried
personally cuz I've seen you know I sent out testos to people and they're
like dude you gotta do this one dude you gotta do that one so there's like
there's like actually six that I haven't popped myself that I made and sent out
already you know for people to test yeah I mean that's that's a problem that I run
into as well I've never stopped to really run a lot of my own stuff and to
and to work it which is why there's not much of any of it out there just because
it's not in a position that I feel like it that I want to put my name on
anything you know at this point when I do when I do have it I will put my name
on it but I'm not just putting stuff out to put stuff out it kind of to that
point neither are you testing is so huge your your strains is actually one of the
best results I've seen as far as the amount of people testing it and the
amount of people posting their pictures and posting their grow diet yeah that
Amy Aces dude seriously is across the freaking globe once once a few people
it is real deal I'll tell you so that I made Amy Aces it was the mother is from
a bag seed that I found by eight nine ten years ago now and the father is
Cheesequake and basically I had the Cheesequake I love the Cheesequake
female but I ended up undoing her but I kept the Cheesequake male because I knew
that you know salad because that's the other thing sub cool love him or hate
him he tested all of his gear massively with many people's and if it wasn't
right he wouldn't release it so that's kind of why I chose a Cheesequake male
and when I was gonna go hit up that well I call proprietary and the bag C
clone that I got I had God bud from Jordan the islands in there and I also
had some that Jordan put out called Oh God which was OG kush by God blood so I
basically pollinated all three of those and I sent out testers I sent out all
three packs to people I'm like you know grow them out tell me which one you like
best so eventually people started trickling I like this one the best like
that one the best they all like the more it was all different and so I figured I'd
try and keep growing making more of all of them but I did I lost the God but I
lost the Oh God mother but I still have the proprietary and but yeah once people
see that it's a good string and I consider like so I'm growing weed a long
time so I think I know when what good is you know so my whole entire life is
not was a Gino on you know looking for a strange but at one point I tell the
story one point the lady sold the house I pretty much lost everything so I had
to start over start popping billions of seeds to find shit and that's when I
realized how fucking ugly the market is how many Herms popped up so and that's
what prompted me to actually start growing making my own beans and that's
the long and short of it but once people see success and I consider myself now
kind of like a growers breeder because if it does if it's not easy to grow up
it's pain in the ass or it doesn't like me it usually doesn't last too long you
know I'm really glad that you mentioned you know that your whole life has kind
of been a pheno hunt that is kind of you know that makes me feel better at
night when I'm looking through stuff because I don't have the capacity to do
the numbers that I would like to or to properly do it but I'm able to judge
these say four plants off of the thousands that I have seen and my life
so it's not like I'm just have four plants right here it's like you kind of
you can tell which ones are this is special you know right right there you
go and a little cheat you could use if you get you know genetics from good
breeders they did a lot of work for you so you may be hunting a pack of ten but
they hunted a pack of a thousand not to say you should rip off their hard work
you know whatever it's all to them if they're right like I tell everyone
people hit me up go can I use this pretty with I'm like dude yeah
definitely do it I'd rather see you you know make more and get to people so but
yeah that's a good way to like cheat the cheat the whole thing so that was like
part of my sub cool theories that he already had it tested you know and it
was proven so go with that and I felt safe so yeah yeah yeah you know a hundred
percent because I've worked with his stuff and I've made crosses with his
stuff and that is I mean that's anybody's goal if you're a breeder you
want something that's stable and reliably expresses because you'll be
able to see it in the offspring if it has 16 different expressions well you're
not necessarily sure what you're seeing where it's coming from so if you're ever
trying to back cross or to make other progeny with other cultivars it's hard
to really say who's given what so when you have those like reliably expressing
and you put it against something you're like yeah that well this this plant this
female is totally dominant against this male or this male is really weak
compared to all of the females yeah yeah so I 100% feel that and I know jolly too
you were mentioning here in chat you know you had kind of some ideas on just
like phenos and how they kind of express to and you know again not not every pack
may be a winner so what did you kind of have on on that tip yeah so like there's
some really awesome reputable brands out there and like for me the feeding I
would be like your feeds and your your grow media and the water that you choose
to put on you know and then your altitudes and all of these other little
things and sometimes it just doesn't come out you know like I've had some
amazing stuff that was supposed to be amazing and for some reason it did not
express and sometimes it would express like two seasons down the line you know
yeah and I just having to regrow the same Hawaii electric plant multiple
seasons like the exact same one from a regrow and I didn't like the first
season and the second season and stuff was like oh oh wow and it's like that
and a lot of people don't like that and I would say that like my theory is that
if you are somebody who veggies out your plants that in the veg you you're you
know like starts to influence the genetic code in the mitochondria or
something like that and it alters it you know and if you do this short season
where you get pop and it's like 90 days or like 60 days in veg from the start of
the seed and then you can cut the flower however much time that is that's your
closest to whatever the original grower got his stuff you know that that's what
it's been a lot of times in my experience you know like this guy right
here I got to have the original stuff from the dudes long time ago and when I
recam across the leaf I was like oh dude I know this one you know and it did not
look good in my grow at all until it flowered and then it just started
uptaking nutrients totally differently and it corrected all of its issues and
it was really weird like that you know but the effect in the flavor was like
worth it for me and just brought back some nice old times a lot of what people
are searching for hunting for these days are the old days you know yeah a lot of
people are looking for the new height but there's also a lot of people looking
for like remember when so I totally get that that's pretty cool you had a guest
on and his invisible gardener and he was talking about how dudes from the 60s and
stuff experience their highs differently yeah like I remember this from like old
trippers who I talked to and you know not everybody is at a certain level of
mind or whatever and it's like huge you know like they would say like assimilate
your last trip before tripping again and I'm like like the only difference is
that but y'all is messing with me and I know it and then for me to call you on
it you're just gonna keep on messing with me so what's the point you know and
that's that's like the nutshell and this guy is all like just take one toke and
then ride out the high and see how like is it really an amazing high because you
know like my strains over here some of them got real banging leveling down
highs like I smoked the Hawaiian bubble berry earlier and I went swimming and
stuff in cold water and I'm tripping high like my these packs are shimmering
and moving you know what I'm saying like they're breathing on me and I I
haven't I smoked maybe half a joint and I'm just coasting that down and that's
over five hours ago I see Dave Dave's got a reload there what I kind of
recognize these what do you got though there buddy you should recognize them
it's the ranch I got a little collection going from Adam got some of his bulu the
white runs pina the diced the KP the caribbean the Pompeii the Kahlua the
fizz the burgers and beer which you have the quarantine which is the AJ sour
diesel and the bog sour strawberry okay I haven't seen that one yet the East
Coast sour D and bog sour strawberry GMO and bog sour strawberry
box our strawberry and grape pie and bog sour strawberry
but the diagonal and bog sour strawberry I'm just gonna go to this yes can see my
face right now just keep going wow yeah you can't really get those sour
strawberries anymore but another one I want to show off is I'm growing because
I'm actually growing it right now this TK bandana from skunk tech okay well
tell us just tell us about how it's growing like how it came up from like
germination to however many branches or leaves it's at right now well here's the
thing it's a cut I got a cut so I went with what's gone with skunk tech went
and selected and then he made the seeds available so I was like all right well I
got to make I got to grab them now just in case something ever happens to that
cut because it's absolutely wonderful it's literally like you dipped the buds
in like 91 octane Wow Wow smell and taste smell taste it's heaven they are
some of the most iced out buds I've seen in a while too for me for me right like
that that's that's impressive because I'm not exactly growing like the the
best buds in the world you know you're not seeing me with J BZ dude you're yeah
you you you've got a great palate so yeah that's awesome
wow that's good here let's uh let's real quick I want to go I'll go grab my my
little starts show you guys a couple burgers and beers in there I got the a
couple the purple pineapples from the ranch which have the purple urkel in
there see look at that guy look at that guy the burgers and beers right there
from the ranch and actually all of these now I know burgers well burgers and
beers might be sold out yeah burgers sold out on your website okay this was
not available on your website the rest of you should be the rest of you should
be another carabiners on the website the kalua's on the website that dice the KP
pretty sure the bulu the fizz and white runs are as well okay yep and he might
have added a couple up there recently I know in dog a dark garden I've got that
down in the corner that's where you can find a lot of the work from the ranch
and that's where you can find a lot of the offerings from people that you see
here oh and actually perfect actually Peter just put that into chat everybody's
got a link directly to the ranch right now so that's directly in chat I put it
up here but it's not clickable but yeah definitely the dog and garden is a great
place to find some some breeders and some new upcoming breeders we've got a
few exciting additions coming to that soon so we'll do that and actually it
looks like Peters in there I'll add some more burgers and beers so we'll have
more more burgers and beers for everybody and let me let me give away
some more seeds here real quick before I go and grab those just to show you what
I've got cooking here this one I was actually I was he asked me if I wanted
one or two crosses and this is one of the two that I was like you know I'd
really love to give that one a shot again as you can see here it was more
than just one or two that you sent don't close okay oh where'd it go here it is
okay so the blueberry pie times the soup I again we're on the a sephiroth tip so
blueberry a sephiroth is what he's going with here do a 10 pack of these I am
looking for the name of the seed company I'm gonna give you the initials I'm
looking for the full name spelled out and first person in chat to have that
that lives in the US will send a 10 pack out of the blueberry a sephiroth so
the four initials I'm looking for the full name is SSSC so if anybody in chat
can tell me what that means can I play you're taking care of dude you're taking
care of you're taking care but yeah anybody in there I know cuz I love these
in Canada I feel bad every time but I'm not we have a winner everybody I will
send those down to you they're gonna be awesome and good guests too and if you
guys haven't see look at that see if you guys haven't guessed a theme yet we're
going with some of the classic seed banks right now both of these trivia
questions have been the classic seed banks so yeah super sativa seed club
SSSC who's also responsible for my favorite packaging that I've seen they
were putting them in old cassette tapes you know the little part where the tape
would sit in the middle with the clear window they take the tape out they pop
their seeds in there put it back together and send it in a cassette deck
so yeah super sativa seed club a new age exotic seeds from Amsterdam that's
cool BAM there you go see that's the TOW logo that we're looking for would you
ask one your duchess cut please shed
yeah yeah I could I mean awesome yeah I'm gonna send you plenty plenty of
material like I have no doubt it reliably expresses in the crosses that
I've done with it majority of the time that's exactly what you're getting in
the progeny so it's awesome but yeah I'm gonna we're gonna keep in touch and
you'll be able to follow the progress of that because again I know what it does
for you and I've got a lot of crosses plus the original that will find its way
to you so yeah I wanna I want to hear you know how it goes for you and help me
help me steer it so that's another fun thing about people doing seeds and
testing is you get input back and in a variety because I'm indoors you're
outdoors that's gonna be huge so you're probably gonna have better yields and I
get with it damn it I'm in a pit like I get like maybe six hours of direct Sun
and so everything you're seeing is like at its most minimalist but then it's
still it's banging like I've smoked a lot of buds like you could say that I
was Tyrone of weed like I was a straight crackhead of weed I sold all of
my stuff more than one time to buy another bag of weed you know or a seed
on more than one occasion the seeds provide but you gotta wait yeah yeah it
was good because I got a lot of experience you know like I got to smoke
a lot of strains and then now like when people tell me like they got 91 chem if
he doesn't have this specific effect it's not 91 chem you know even it might
be the cut and stuff like that but it's pheno doubt and it no longer has the
thing that makes it desirable to me yeah yeah let's see here who wants to show
off a pack or an item while I go grab my plants I mean I got people but if one
of these other guys want to show off something
jolly feel free you've got quite the collection to look at so okay let's pick
pick one that you like or that you bought because it may have a fruity or a
sweet expression to it hey all right this right here is a medic and blue
blood and I got it on a crapshoot right and like I was really excited about the
description and you know how it is like some deeds like that's how we all wish
that it would have come out and they still release it and so that's why some
people are apprehensive to put up descriptions but this dude was like
really amazing amazing but the flavor was like extreme fruit punch or
something like that and then it was like a narcotic sleeper like 15 minutes later
just straight out but it was like flavored to the bone from the start of a
joint to the end of it like extremely pungent delicious like fruit punch
heavy berry it was a fem that was the one that I grew but I I crossed a male
of it from the rakes pack with stuff like melange a gold and I don't think
it's gonna have any help with knocking down the effects because the laundry
gold was insane like so heady it was like doing a little bit too much racing
mind psychedelics and unable to function
yeah not everybody likes a good buzz but every most people still want to remain functional
like radical you know you couldn't give this to most people and and they would
be okay like they would have like really bad thoughts in the wrong direction for
whatever it is that their egos have developed I mean these guys are amazing
humbled CSI yeah I I bought it on like a whim I was like I have to try your
Durban poison and Durban poison had a pungent flavorful like kind of fruity or
something like that experience and I had ruined that plant like ruined it I
sprayed it with a contaminated sprayer and I sprayed it with fish pond water
you know I was just blasted or whatever but it also like lets me know how
resistant a plant is to contaminants like that and it whited out right all of
it whited out and then I cleaned it up with like hydrogen peroxide and stuff
and some of the buds still had the extreme pungent flavor even through the
horrible hydrogen peroxide you know smell like if you've ever done a hydrogen
peroxide so to kill all the mycos or something that you sprayed on it yeah
it was amazing see Antho and here's CSI hard to beat yep see that was that was
one that I had on the top of my list to pop was from CSI and I do it next time
it's next time okay let me let's see speaking of purple Urkel go for it
now I was just saying oh you said it was on deck and now it's next oh yeah
next next next totally let me show you these are the starts of the purple
pineapple from the ranch that I just popped so there we go so these are these
are did you have the purple pineapple there Dave no I do not have the Urkel
and the pina okay so yeah the Urkel and the pina and this is kind of how it is
shaping up right now again these were New Year's pops I think they took 36
hours well everything everything that I put in there 36 hours germinated had
tails then I put it under the soil took another day or two before it popped up
above the soil and here we are right now so those are the the purple pineapples
from the ranch and I've got one more from the ranch here I'll show you going
at the moment and those are the burgers and beers so these are the burger beers
burgers and beers kind of the same time frame I've got a crusty leaf on here
that's user error but yeah you know these are coming in pretty nice as well
obviously no smells or anything detectable yet but they're they're
growing up good everything's about the same size same same leafs that I set I
mean we're already on you know going on to the seven leafers right now and we're
but three nodes up something like that so those are from the ranch I'll show
you some of the other ones later as yeah these are some awesome stuff that I got
back in 2013 like this is the blue Hawaiian it had the the plant that got
seeded accidentally had tins of neon blue and yellow on the but you know like
it looked exactly like the picture and this dude site was one of my first
favorite sites to go to because he had a huge catalog of pictures and grows on it
before and then he switched his format and changed it up because of like
legalities or something but I mean just amazing gear like if it's not how they
describe it on the base then I usually I'm not really a fan of it and this guy
had the description his Malawi gold was the real Malawi gold I mean somebody
will never smoke my buds again because they smoked my Malawi gold and it made
them trip out like they did acid I was like yes thank you so much I have had
some of those you know almost acid like trips and I'm wondering Tao if you got
some of that from some of these sativas that you tried or grew earlier especially
maybe like the chocolate tie are you getting that kind of electric stone from
a lot of these dad well you know let's be honest there someone gives to me
rhombary in 2018 rhombary seeds were labeled and I grew them out I guess 20
2020 I guess and man that should snuck up on me at like most I've loved smoking
weed all the weed whether it knocks you on your ass where they get you totally
high you know whatever I love it all some people like give me that third eye
high that's all I want but some people like I want to go to sleep but I love it
all but this rhombary was the only weed that okay no maybe there was one other
one that I don't know the name of it but this weed when I smoke it I get stupid
and it's not like I'm anxiety riddled but I'm just like jet like I'm all
twisted I'm like HAD HD HD is what I can imagine what that would be like you
know like you can't keep a thought you're just like all over the place but
earlier in my life there was definitely a couple strains that I would call
closer to psychedelic but I never like tripped out like I've done acid and
true mescaline and shit and I never had a marijuana like me it acid but I've
had one experience with it was the amnesia haze and it it made me I was
happy I was jolly but I was stupid to the point to where I was having a
conversation with somebody and trying to write them a note but I kept writing
what I was saying instead of writing what I was meaning to write and it was
just the funniest fucking thing in the world to me so yeah that amnesia haze
was like like the closest I've gotten there yeah we got all but the last like
20 seconds all right all right cuz it might shit keeps dropping I don't know
this time the web page just died I don't know what but whatever sorry for
the interruption now you're all good towel dude I appreciate you joining us
tonight I know it's late where you're at I'm on the West Coast so it's still a
little bit early for me but you're all good yeah this is a wait no yeah no
worries child's had his cookie for the day right have you had your cookie today
towel yes I had peace actually yeah he's up he's up he's used to being up
late he goes on Eagle yeah Eagle is like cuts it at 5 a.m. in the East Coast
awesome canna man Dan Hayes gets him like that too that was that was fun I
definitely intend to do that again let's see here let's let's give away
another 10 pack you guys what's that I think it's you unless it's me cuz I
don't know what's going on I think it was all of us but now you're back shit
I'm the one who fucking like kicked myself out of the studio I'm like oh
geez I spilled dirt on my computer as I do this to the trackpad which loads the
previous page that you were on so in case anybody wondered what happened
there that's what happened again we'll do another 10 pack us only we're keeping
it on the ass afrast tip thank you kazoo shoutouts to kazoo cush again for kind
of making all of these giveaways possible tonight and this this one again
it is called the wookiee a safras looks like wookiee cookies from bud white
genetics times the soup I mail which was a Seattle chronic or Seattle chronic
asafras and then these are regulars they're testers so we'll be giving out a
10 pack for this I am looking for let's see here okay how do I geez how do I do
some of these trivia things I'm gonna put it I'm gonna put the answer into our
private chat here so nobody can think I'm crazy so actually let's have jolly
why don't you do you want to show us a show us another pack here real quick and
then I'll get something inside it's gonna make us think you're not crazy dad
damn it well play I got this is some smileys angels here and I was fortunate
enough to get to try some smiley garden but my friend was like came out from
Michigan and I cooked it up with a little bit and then like it was tasty
you know I know what the mothers are starting out with and so I know that
there is like a real genetic code versus like I can't point out the ones you know
like some of these are not winners you know they're just like impulse buys when
I went on a tangent and I just wanted to buy it because I thought there might be
a chance and some dudes they they really don't have the code it's like it's just
gotten so watered down and diluted that you don't really get anything at the end
of the day and by the time you nurse it back with the living soils and stuff
it's like it's a different strain because the genetic code has like
completely morphed and that mitochondria is just pumping out a new code from you
know what you thought you were getting you know yeah you know I just want to
say something quick about the more unknown breeders or even they don't
consider themselves breeders but like since I've been active kind of in the
social medias and people kind of know me they've been offering me beans all the
time and I hate to say no but I've been trying I say no and then someone just
send me them and then I have to do a shout out because I'm not rude and then
the guy was like why didn't you take seeds for me but my whole point of this
is some of the best shit I've grown in recent times comes from just friends
that have made their own breed or because like so a lot of them are like
me or like you they grow weed all the time poppin beans all the time they'll
know too when something is a little special or better than most and you know
I'd say don't be afraid to try unknown unknown people unknown strains and I
like growing it all and I'm a little different because really the first seeds
I grew were from bags of weed that I bought that had seeds in it you know
that was like the option and then and then to get it from Amsterdam that was
one of the first things that ever got confiscated I ordered a catalog from you
know London or whatever from Amsterdam it got confiscated JFK I got a letter in
the mail in my parents house saying that they had drug paraphernalia and the
customs of JFK if I want to come pick it up yeah I got one of those I got an
email with that one I didn't respond I don't I wasn't even expecting anything
so I have no idea what the fuck that was about I'm like I wish I saved that I
wish I saved that letter that would have been my but yeah that was a slightly
scary and uh but but that's why another reason why I'm not afraid to just try
unknown seeds from people cuz you know you get some really great stuff even
from from shit that came imported you know cuz I tell people all the time back
in the day brick we do whatever you can get good season brick we because it
started out as good then they wrench it into a brick and they break half of the
seeds and freaking whatever else then it sits somewhere for a year and then it
gets shipped to you and God knows how it gets shipped by the time you get it if
it's any good at all there's a good chance that some of those seeds could
have been good from the beginning that you know we just got trampled on right
well that's half that's a lot of the stuff people are looking for these days
they're like oh I want the old walk-in I want the old you know land race yeah so
a lot of a lot of people are kicking themselves like damn it they came free
with every bag why didn't I know but you know you again you're totally right and
I want to bring it 360 back to the Aladdin movie we're looking for a
diamond in the rough here oh yeah when you do to the early reference it's a
whole new world so yeah taking taking you know beans from people that you're
familiar with or that you know the world isn't quite familiar with yet as long as
you have faith and they're they're testing process you're gonna find some
awesome things again it's I don't know it's like music like there's there's not
there's people in the upper level and they're only like 5% of the people
there's a lot of other people that are doing the exact same freaking thing yeah
and at some point one of them just hits it they make the right melody right make
the right tune same with seeds man so there's a lot of a lot of potential
out there like yeah what he meant smiley's gardens that would make me
think about it and what's even better is when try one of the mothers of fathers
you know from the person himself that's even better so I think that's really
cool jolly that you got some of them smileys in Philippines yeah I was sorry
what's that like the usual strains I would go for you know because I don't
really like the dopamine vacations that much I'm more of a like a wired here and
clear yeah yeah Chad you know what we could do a pack of enemies giveaway if
you want to work the trivia again you could pick it yeah yeah no that'd be
awesome I bet people would love this do you want to maybe go listen we'd go
international but I'm nervous about Australia for Australia wins they've
been getting not I've been hearing stories that they're not getting a male
but we could always give it a college try so yeah it's really expensive I
would cut that out it's like $100 to ship to them no listen to me so
a little known fact that I was privy to about two years ago there's these things
called global stamps and there are buck 30 each and if you get like an envelope
like I didn't even do it in the corrugated shit like that I put in one
of those centrifuges in my little packaging that I do I tape it to a piece
of paper so it stays in the middle of the envelope so when it goes through the
the readers it's like won't get crushed or like get stuck or whatever anyway
I've sent to Ireland Trinidad Tobago where else a whole bunch of places
Canada a whole bunch of times and just in a regular envelope with that method
and it made it and it only put three stamps on so for three dollars and 90
cents I mailed beans to all those places and every single one made it not going
so far so so yeah I don't know I'm pretty sure I'll work for Australia too
so whatever if so Australia wins I'll figure it out we'll make it all right
well that's awesome that opens it up to a lot more people and I know they're
gonna be getting some fire so let's do that I realized I haven't done the
wookiee ass a frass yet so no I'm gonna save that one and then we'll do the Amy
aces right now with the answer that I already put into the private chat and I
will give everybody the question right now we're looking for a person's name
we're looking for their first name and their last name and this person is the
person who founded the Amsterdam Hash Museum and he's also credited as being
one of the founding fathers of one of the oldest sea banks in that country so
what is this person's first and last name get it into chat first person that
gets it into chat is going to win I believe you actually opened the very
first coffee shop with that offered cannabis too yeah I wouldn't doubt it
and I see it pop up here already we've got
hemp seed oh well oh god all right okay so how about how do we want to do this
here because I just realized he's missing an R Eric's missing an R but
Eric is not screwed Eric and Rick W so Rick W let us know in chat you've got
the option of Amy aces or the wiki a sephiroth let us know in chat which one
you would like and we will get that one to you Eric you're gonna get the other
option here damn it you missed the R but you know what everybody wins right so
well hey thank you there and he did come back and he did add the R here but
yeah no so he was he was first there but we've got let's see let me go back up
here and write this down I'm gonna make sure okay but we got Rick W with the
actual answer here so let me just write these down real quick and I'm gonna put
Dave on full screen again because it looks like he's reloaded so what do you
got what do you got there man I see I see okay so where are these coming from
first of all okay well the silver ones are all from skunk tech you got the
dome piece which I showed earlier the TK bandana which I showed earlier but he's
also got the Bermuda Triangle Hayes which is the TK Cuban black haze the
fire crotch was one of my favorite names the the a5 Hayes one of those old school
hazes hit with the the caramel f1 which is chem 91 and I'm pretty sure it's
cream caramels with that I could be mistaken on but then we'll move on with
the hazelene which is the SF eo G and the Cuban black haze and the chem 91 and
headband and I figured since cows on this chocolate tie kick I should bring
out those chocolate tie and keyed cherry cush because that that keyed cherry
cush is a proven cherry dominant male that sounds interesting
yeah it's yeah cherry ak-47 and alien alien cush okay yeah that alien cush is
pretty legit from what I understand yeah this was hunted out by four wise eyes
in Michigan using the the creator up in in Ontario keyed weed seeds I believe is
a is tag on Instagram but they collaborated together to you know
determine the the most cherry dominant expressions while it was growing to make
sure that it would produce that in the final product and it every time it seems
to do it so these are ones that I've been excited to run and from the data on
there they're a few years old already 11 17 yeah have you been dating them as you
get them or is that these came dated to me this came dated to me so certain
readers if it's their own projects they they tend to to work that and they
especially Ozark he's great at putting dates on his then his work letting you
know how old it already is yeah I've I've made a couple batches of the
amiases and I've kept them separated and labeled as well I do believe this
there's actual differences in you know each run even I'm over here teasing just
because it gets a little bit more complicated I'm not I'm not able to do
it to Canada from here Rick W who was like in the Wookiees is in Canada so
maybe what I could do is get some of the Wookiees to Tao to pack with the amiases
to get there for you so you double okay so so we'll get that rounded up and make
that happen for you Rick W so you can actually and everybody that wins tonight
you can just hit me up in my Instagram with all the contact information again
Chad that Westport is my Instagram and realize it may take you know a couple
days to week to get things in motion for you but we'll make it happen so yeah
Rick W definitely it looks like you'll be the double bonus winner tonight of
amiases and the Wookiee and Eric hemp seed absolutely still included in this
will get you the Wookiee as a frass as well so boo yeah thank you Tao for
throwing in some of those amiases man those are those are hot shit and is is
there anywhere that people are gonna be able to get these in the future
I don't want to drink the chat but they're on their way to Peter knock on
wood and if the USPS doesn't fail eventually they'll be available on the
dog a garden get the shut the front door I got that garden that's awesome and
actually to where you're you're in good company here I know Jolly Canada you've
got some offerings up on Daga yeah we got some truth of the treat up right now
and some Maui Dutch treat cross with Jordan of the islands dust treat
northern lights dominant it's awesome stuff like I'm a I'm a one-off artist
you know like I've been hoping to gather some cloud with all you guys and get you
guys hyped on some just amazing stuff that I come across and in the the test
row I was wowed you know I was gonna do $50 a pack for all of my stuff that I
now I want 424 after I tested it because I've grown a lot of stuff and I was I
was that amazed and and wowed at it and you'll never be able to get it again
it's like a genetic lottery you know like you can get one pack and get a
winner and you're the only dude who ever get that nobody else will be able to get
that and once it's gone it's gone oh thank you yeah good prices everybody
can get in there and you know pick your winner you look I was never a dealer or
anything like that but I I grew up in the culture a little bit and I knew a
lot about you know a lot of things and the truth is a Amherst sour diesel which
is like this amazing old-school dealer strain because it's got the skunk in the
right way so that you have to smoke like an ounce before it becomes like this
awesome functional high otherwise it's just this like what like I'm blasted but
it's super pungent flavor and they were all like the mothers were all super
dominant like as dominant as can be in Amherst sour diesel and there's like a
rare outlier of Maui and the rare outlier is that is like the the real the
truth and then but it's really difficult to get I've only seen it once in my life
and it was an awesome high similar to the winter cut of Jordan of the Islands
does treat but it just like a sweet flavor zone and we knocked down the
height with the Northern Lights dominant Jordan of the Islands Dutch treat like
straight knocked it down like we got one that's a sweet little fruity stinker and
it's maybe a foot tall with like a bunch of little branches and some nice small
but it's reeks you know like a jolly some of that have you grown many God
Bud crosses from Jordan no I had God Bud one time a friend of mine made a joke
and they were gonna like they were gonna take like most of the bugs and I was
like you know like can you call up your friend and he's like he's got God's
treat you know like like he was gonna you know snake like half the ounce if I
picked it up from him and it was gonna be God's treat I was like this fucking
guy buddy but it's an awesome like classic Hawaiian guy which is functional
and narcotic I grew a bunch of like got blue God which is like blueberry by God
Bud and they were like short they were slow veggie and they all had these fat
leaves and they're all deceiving because they was short but there was so much
leaf mass that they would try out and they never like they didn't droop on the
dry out it was like bizarro but I like I like Jordan of the island stuff it's all
been pretty good from what I would I've run some of them like I say are slow
veggie and short plants but if you let them develop and get big then they grow
Oh Epi well so like some of my strains the premiums like the Shanghai had
several phenos and one of them was like gigantic like basically head-sized buds
and then the other one next to it was like the size of a thumb after the
summer but the one next to it had like this insane unique turt profile that you
know made it worth spending that much time on it and then the one next to it
it just it got too much vegging and the center got the betrayed us or something
like that and then the outside was all smokeables but they don't want to be
grown like a lot of these Hawaiian plants especially the the older ones and
when I say older I mean like the 80s zone when green harvest hit like they
cut them down and they started using more like classic like indica as in the
chemotype description of like a short plant with the fat leaves and right if
you veg it out you're usually gonna get mold or you're gonna get something like
that because they don't they want to be little soldiers that don't get above
three feet otherwise like I'm smoking less than a gram a day I pull less than
a pound a year and like raging chronic you know like I was like a dick about it
for a long time and then I confronted my addiction you know because I was like
like classic if you were to mix like a Hawaii local boy with like a Jersey
local boy exactly it's a tan and just like write it out and like you know like
I smoked you out and here it is like you got buds and you're not gonna smoke me
out you know now I'm gonna I'm gonna get in your face a bit but it's usually just
gonna be me like like the next time that some big dude wants to mess with you I'm
just gonna sit back and laugh you know just give me the Billy Bagsby face
straight-ice teeth yeah I'm just I'm sorry I'm in the background here I'm
just pulling out stickers of like I saw I saw biggest pop in the chat I'm like
hey it's biggest and then we got this this guy Jolly Canada kind genetics on
the screen talking with us too oh yeah pulling stuff out everybody knows who
that okay anyways let me real quick I want to get these things actually I'm
looking at him now and they're looking at me like dude I'm not under my light
so let me finish here I'll go finish the tour of what we cracked speaking of mr.
bone there mr. Billy bag seeds I popped two of the RKS times space cheese that
he has let's see here pretty cool right now we got one of them right here
looking good the other I need to make a video because I start I start out with
like a half pot and then I let it you know the stem grow up and then you
backfill it like this so it has more support that's how you stop getting
stretchy legs on seeds but so these are the two RKS time space cheese but if you
look you'll notice that the leaf god I'm trying to get him to leaf morphology is
a little bit different on each of them which excites me because I'm wondering
you know is one gonna be more skunk side is one gonna be more cheese side so
those those are the the RKS time space cheese from mr. toad that got started
I showed you the ones from the ranch we've got this is from free thinkers
conservation it's a local skunk which is a Duke diamonds Dominion seeds cross
times goji-oji which is from Bodhi this one is taking off and growing just
perfectly fine perfectly normal again everything I'm showing you is the same
age this one topped itself I hope it can like zoom in here it topped itself
before it even got a node but the weird part is it's totally blowing out the
cotyledon with a branch that's coming out of it so kind of a kind of a crazy
little plant here this is one of two that's doing growing slowly but again
it's one that popped out fine the goji-oji times local skunk going good
there and then the final one I pulled out his sticker as well boom fire
bee leaf cannabis we've got the Kool-Aid man here Kool-Aid man these ones were a
little bit slower I had to pull the shells off of them but this is the one
that is doing the best Kool-Aid man and then the second one again it's coming in
fine but you know sometimes you have those ones that start off kind of funky
they just start out funky and this is one of those I wish it would focus but
it's not so you can't really see it there all right I'll kind of leave it at
that but I'm gonna go put these back under the light but these were what I
popped on the New Year's so we're not only collecting we are popping them here
and I will keep everybody updated with the progress I'm excited to see what I
pull out of them excellent should I say something about toad seed cracker yes
well so like if you have older beans toad seed cracker is probably scary you
do the seed crack you know like gently cracking the seam and then you do like a
carbohydrates mix with like a very tiny bit of like certain growth hormones you
know but if you overdo it you're gonna kill it and if you under do it it's not
gonna work and so you're searching for like a sweet spot because there's still
seeds you know but it helps exponentially the the crack the pre crack
because sometimes the seams fuses especially on the old seeds like some of
my older gear it's you can tell like there's life it's it's a BB this is
straight BB but the the seam is like welded shut and you'd probably need that
seed cracker to increase the chance I mean you know it blew like neon blue
with neon yellow streaks was the blue Hawaiian mother and there was like the
real Malawi gold mother and a bunch of just other awesome ones that that were
the expression you know with some like awesome Hawaiian ditch weed like that
was just thrown into the mix and we hope that the melange gold was what hit that
one it's kind of cancel out half of it wrecking insane high
and I'm kind of stoked to that all of these you know so far are staying the
same height they're all staying nice and compact because again that's what five
different cultivars and in one area so I'll be I'll be stoked if yeah I know
right with the right training anything is possible I just got to put this
comment all this talk at Jordan's house nights me have some days we're not
helping here no you guys are adding to my fucking addiction right now he's 30
years doing it and he didn't get that much play and like his stuff is
revolutionary you know for a lot of us and I think you know 30 years of people
not really talking about him too much and stuff and he deserves a little bit
of like yeah he took like I ate it from the US markets for like a while there
but he's back on the IG showing off his shit and it all looks killer I got that
and you know what since you mentioned mr. toad I gotta say shout out to mr.
tokens he dropped some knowledge he has like products and stuff that I was
unaware of that are just like blowing my mind that I need to get some that early
girl clone domes is one of the things that I first saw from him and there's a
company that makes pollen bags that I was unaware of to that he brought to my
attention indirectly so he's just awesome and he's not shy with his
knowledge and he's uh he knows what he's talking about so shout out to mr.
code yeah resource DDA designated dank area
boneyard seeds repping them all up here and actually one of the things that I've
been holding them in to is this this is this is a FCP collectible actually I'm
not sure if they're still up on the site but drew brofie is an artist pretty
famous there's had some conversations here but yeah this is the rolling tray
so special edition right there yeah it's a pot leaf and he's surfing it works out
for me oh get the get the reflection in there as I say okay I'm not gonna brush
the weed off this way cuz then I'll cancel
all right you know we're a graphics design company and you're buying graphics
and then you're getting a freebie souvenir you know but we're graphics
first and with the endless wave life if you surf like you know you want that
endless wave with a wall and a barrel
all right thank you and yes we just definitely hundred percent big ups mr.
toad in the house yep that's I showed off a lot of genetics that I got from
him on the last episode episode 3 and and I'm pretty sure to Dave we did go
through the conservation or free thinkers conservation I thought we were
fighting over who gets to show that one oh I was gonna let you show it yeah the
91 chem headband oh we haven't done this one yet Wow okay yeah let me show off
here for a second shit everybody sit down okay so this is actually if you go
back and watch episode 3 Dave myself and can't cabrone the cam he's got a company
based on the East Coast the free thinkers Society this was awesome
packaging that he sent you can see it here and inside I have we've got some
fun crosses here and I actually put them in the bags but we have a dog patch
number two times the f3 skycuttler cush I should take these out of the bags what
a rookie I do the same thing though chat so that yeah you don't lose the tag right
yep exactly too and I just wanted to add a little another layer of just kind of a
moisture protection usually anything that even comes in the tubes that people
get I usually just put that in a bag as well maybe toss a little stick of rice
in here this one one of my favorite strains of the last few years motor
breath 15 times the black triangle times the LA wedding pop so that's like an
awesome keychain you just have that dangling from your keys but the one that
I actually did pop that and that you guys just saw was the goji og number two
times the local skunk so this one I've already kind of taken out and popped but
again kind of you know cool packaging I love on the inside he had his little
wax stamp as well and that's pretty freaking cool it just really kind of
rounds out you know the presentation of the packaging here so shout out to yeah
shout out to cam thank you very much for for hooking these up some of them
are already wet and in the dirt so big ups to you sir thank you Dave for letting
me bust that one out absolutely he blessed me with this though just because
he was showing it off and he just had to part of that to seed club Raver Dave
that's pretty cool yeah we have good times on the show and it's it's fun like
you've helped me out with the dog shit and that was actually again that was on
the to pop list and at the last minute made it okay next next next time I know
doesn't it but that that's a strain that I've been you know I gave up on it I
thought it was gone I haven't heard it seen it for 20 years you happen to have
three feminized seeds of across with it so thank you for sending those out and
hooking me up and we all kind of we all kind of make the fun happen so Raver Dave
totally appropriate I like it absolutely I'm not to talk to Tao after the show
and arrange a little swap with some of his stuff yeah get the goods I know I
know Amy aces isn't the only boys in the yard that he brings to the yard or
however that song goes he brings all the milkshake there we go yeah like I was
saying I got at least I would say I have five proven ones that I would accept
cash for but I have testers that are like I was saying I don't mind just
letting people have at it and checking them out but yeah we definitely talk and
I'll just hook you up whatever and one of the ones I did was a blueberry by
a KB brains I crossed with that cheesequake and I love it I mean not
everybody loves it as much as I do and when I sent some out to people's I also
did a Bruce Banner number three by a cheesequake and that's what I haven't
personally grown out yet so I'm like shy about it but the dude like it's better
than the blueberry by cheesequake so I know a lot of the UK guys were saying
was that the one that they were saying that I do this is the UK cheese that's
that's like that's what I'm getting from it they were getting that off the Amy
aces okay they were pretty freaking happy so bizarre they were getting
everybody gets something different it seems and but whatever they end up with
everybody just loves whatever that comes from it so I'm really happy about that
but I wouldn't you know and one of my first original crosses the Godbird by
cheesequake there was a genotype that I found that was just like you just pull
off the fan leaves and you just left with buds you know it was like a no trim
machine no trim necessary so like talking about working lines eventually I
want to work that into making seeds that will make that particular kind every
time but that's down the line that's why you guys everybody has to do an edible a
day so that you stay live long enough to do all the work you have to do with the
cannabis point I'm not gonna argue that sorry just typing a little and I had it
on me and he signed it awesome no no what do they look like in there the
catalog is it all text does it have pictures yeah this guy is awesome and
this three there's three books in the collection yeah that's freaking awesome
man I love I love the the bud porn you know pre-internet age back when all the
photographs were nice and crisp HP 13 boom let me segue off of that shit right
there lemon but on this the pina hash plant this actually came courtesy of
Rasu Fah so big ups Rasu Fah actually got a few packs here got a some f1 seeds
that he made so everybody's just gonna kind of treasure hunt forbidden fruit
times a Jack Frost f1 a Bruce Banner times blueberry f1 and a pineapple
upside-down cake which made my wife extremely happy times blueberry f1 this
will be fun to get in and to go through and this was unbelievably not
confiscated by the DCC from Sun Grown Mids at the Emerald Cup but apparently
this made that into the hands of Rasu Fah from Sun Grown Mids into me so this
will be exciting but you mentioned the HP 13 hash plant and Sun Grown Mids is
a guy who works with that HP 13 a lot and this is that pina hash plant cross
with the lemon baton so thought I'd thought I'd practice my segues into that
one right there whoa whoa blowin the minds oh Dave's coming back
Dave's coming back with HP 13 times root beer Mr. root beer yes sir
awesome super rare oh I bet I bet like are they are they mean gene or was this
a mean gene he gifted lion tree farms the root beer back cross to and lion
tree brought the HP 13 from with with him from Maui the real HP 13 and made
it made this happen yeah that would be something to try again I'm excited to
dig into to the hash plant cross just that thing can grow like a beast be
great to see the if the pina affects it and just what the lemon baton does do I
just feel fancy saying lemon baton yes
we got a question go ahead tell I was gonna say I can understand if Dave has
analysis paralysis with all those packs he has like how could you choose
speaking of like switching on deck on deck circle would be constantly flipping
it is yeah it's it's it's it's a rough first world seed yeah exactly exactly
it's it's tough because everything sounds so good and you I want to go this
direction and then well maybe a week later I'm like maybe I want to go that
direction yeah it just did never it never seems to end I have that's what I
was looking to swap with you actually okay
yeah I do have my I do have my belief right here as soon as you make your own
cross you want to see what happens and then you want to see what happens you
know exactly exactly you're a hundred percent right and I have sent out a
bunch of testers to a lot of people if I had the room I pop everything I just
made but it's like I don't have the room I have all these other ideas I want to
do so hey who wants to test these and I've had a lot of people say hey sign me
up so yeah yeah that's great and we've got actually a question in chat I kept
it up here now it's gone nope there it is okay and I don't know if anybody
would know the answer Bermuda triangle haze has anybody seen Bermuda triangle
haze for many breeders or maybe in any crosses what do we got there Dave what
do you know about the Cuban black haze that was used in that Dave because
that's a legendary strain that's supposedly like really well kept you
know what I mean yeah supposedly it is the piff yeah right I think there's
there's all arguments and debates on that but always always exactly but those
are from skunk tech this was a drop he did it's no longer available so sorry
whoever was looking for it I might have a second pack okay and there's always
yeah I mean there's always a secondary market that's where I mean a lot of
collectibles wind up in the first place is the secondary market I know with a
lot of you know they're like the Shepherd fairy the art stuff that I
collect he only releases a small amount and if you're not there in the 30 seconds
that they're available then you're out of luck so secondary markets really the
only place to get it yeah I mean that's what I was going for yeah and you you
you had a little experience with the HP 13 to jolly didn't you oh yeah I had the
real cut and my mom made me get rid of it I grew it next to a district
attorneys house and nobody could find my plants you know like I hit them in trees
and stuff and it proved to me that if you don't know how to grow it and you
don't grow it a certain way it will not express as the legendary HP 13 it's just
some big letdown whereas the dude who got me the clone like his HP 13 was like
doing like amazing amazing opiates you know mixed with LSD that's how I would
describe it and then my neglect oh cannabis though was horrible you know
like it had this shape and it smelled nice and it had no flavor and the high
was like 15 minutes maybe I mean we got that but it's we call it BMP because DMT
smoke if you ever smelled it smells like night-blooming jasmines and I don't
know anybody else who has a jasmine turf going right now but the DNT electric has
been very dominant in the jasmine turf across three different crosses and
variations and so there's a good chance that if you get one of like the 16
available packs that you will get some nice jasmine turf influence there we go
there's the answer right there and then is it's kind of fun actually having
people just kind of like shout shout some of these out because a lot of us
may remember them and a lot of us may have seen them I'm just trying to scroll
up and find the last one somebody was just asking about it was there it is
there's a DNA genetics that kosher kush man that kosher kush wound up in a lot
of other strains which for that particular time period people were
moving on to the next thing very quickly a lot of people that was almost the era
when people weren't focused on preserving they were focused on the next
and I think we've lost a lot of good strains from that time frame but
somebody's out there has got to have that one that kosher kush was a great
one so we were talking earlier too about you know some breeders that you might
not have heard of but they're still you know putting out fire or you know just
the same potential as everybody else to have fire I just want to shout out to a
couple people let's see here I got the stickers in here one of them being
universal elements genetics sent me up a couple packs I haven't tried these yet
but a Mac Pearl which is the Mac times early pearl which is a sensi seeds old
strain which I love the idea yes so it'll be interesting too because you
know again you mix some old school with the new school is what's gonna come out
gonna be super vigorous are they on the opposite ends of the spectrum so yeah
that's cool universal elements genetics big ups to that and kind of the same
time the same conversation I met the gentleman from ultra fire genetics and
yeah he said he sent me out a pack with a bunch of different crosses in here and
again there there are a lot of the kind of the strains that are going on today
which I don't have a bunch of so that's kind of exciting for me we've got let's
see ice cream cake number 22 times the Paradise Circus so cool little cool
little jars going on here member berries papaya sunrise that sounds good but yeah
so you know I'm expecting to kind of go through these and I don't doubt that
I'm gonna find something in here that really you know hits the palate in the
right way and this isn't a person that has $200 packs either so that's always
nice he does a hybrid grow of organic and synthetic which probably really
buy with your stuff it's super clutch food people who are gonna use their
collectibles is anything other than what I got going here which is just I
love looking at them and going through them is to know like the Fino and stuff
the information of the breeder and the seeder so that you don't buy like some
horrible reduced genetic because it's really rare that you get somebody who
grows synthetics and it'll express well in a living soil at least in my
experience I've only had like one or two dudes who've had anything like that
did you have any other any other memorabilia or any any tax that you were
interested in in telling a little story about I mean I could always pull some
more stuff out you know like trading cards or anything yeah okay no worries
we're gonna blow up Dave here I recognize that logo already we got some
aka bean brains what are we looking at here yeah well the aka bean brains is
the Williams wonder old-school classic you were talking about some old-school
goodies there yeah hey if anybody in the chat can clue me into some Beatrix
choice please do I've been looking for that for a little while now that's
another old-school SSC goodie and the skunk bank it's skunk tech but this is
the will come 91 willies wonder that definitely has potential again I'm a
huge chem 91 fan so that's an awesome mix and yeah Williams wonder for me the
cuts that I've had they've just been really great mellow happy smokes you
know I would lean on more towards the sedative effects but not over the top
it's just been a nice general relaxation and I don't know I kind of
get that with a lot of the you know pre 90s or pre 2000 strains I'm trying to
figure out what to call them because I don't know I'll call them the old-school
strains and somebody from the 70s it's like son that wasn't even around when I
was your age yeah I try to figure it out terminology it's all relative man it's
again I've been a music person my whole life and I love it when somebody says a
band is old-school and I'm like yeah I think I remember them just breaking
through when I kind of stopped paying attention you have any obscure finds you
know like you found it in the first 500 views and it's it was up for like four
years and nobody listened to it but it's awesome yeah I mean I tell people
this it's probably like one of my favorite mixes is there's a artist
called breakage and it's BBC's radio one it's the BBC immense essential mix
number 501 it's a two-hour mix from breakage that is just the best bass
voyage that I can think of it's 10 years old or something right now still gets
heavy rotation so yeah I'm a freaking databank of obscure but fun music and
anthro looks like anthos since Amelia is asking about the the two Amy aces
lineages and I think we broke that down it's got the cheese quake and then kind
of the proprietary in there okay yeah okay yeah that's that's what it is it's
cheese quick cheese quick mail to that proprietary clone that I've been keeping
okay if it works for you I don't know if the camera cameras working there or not
I got I got things that I collect you know if you go over okay there we go
cannabis Canada we got the magazine there and that's the Golden Gate Bridge
though dude it looks like the Golden Gate Bridge that's not in Canada this is
the precursor name to cannabis culture from Mark Emory I've smoked cannabis
culture Dana Lawson was the editor yeah that's Mark Emory then I got the first
whoa premieres your high times I've never seen that I've never seen a
person with that holy shit it's $1 the red the $1 one I think there's a the
second issue the second run was a towel 50 I think so yeah that's pretty cool
yeah man I've never I've never seen this the first time I've ever seen this
my desk drawer you know I got tons of all the other ones too yeah then I got
like other there's this book electro photography huh and the only curling you
guys here the curling photography where they like energized stuff and then take
pictures of it well the only reason I got the book is because they did it with
cannabis and yeah it's featured on the back cover so that was pretty cool yeah
this is I have I have all the ones but this one just happened to be in there I
have a whole bunch of calendars so yeah I've been collecting all things cannabis
for a long time and like oh I'll get multiple editions to like this one's
like totally like almost brand-new in 1980 cow calendar you know but talking
about like old-school strains that people want it's like Colombian gold Wow
and you like you'd see the seeds in it and yeah that's what they thought was a
centerfold shot yeah that is right clammer shot right there
like do you talk about the axe whatever you pronounce it and you can see like
this if it focuses yeah oh okay there's resin there's definitely resin all over
that you know even though it is seeded and you guys would like thinking we're
shit today that shit puts you on another place you know there's the mohawk and
gold you just see how sparse and like you can see the seeds fell out of the
pods right there it's pretty I didn't realize this is another mohawk in a
little a little more beefier and you can still see it was all suited back in the
pods there and it's like every shot the seeds in there like speaking of
sensibilia so these actually are seedless oh wow and that's what
sensibly means if you guys run away that's that's all it means like if you
see grapes in the supermarket they'll say sensibly on it's the seedless I
thought they were I thought I was gonna get stoned
this is a lie it says Mexican sensibilia but you can see right there
there was a seed in that pod that popped out right yeah they're like close enough
bro close enough it works right there too yeah you see that one there's a pod
right there that you can tell it was a seed in there that's pretty funny oh yeah so Hawaiian I don't know if you guys had old school Hawaiian that shit is special dude Hawaii that's where the garden of Eden got clipped off from the rest of the world right there I believe I've said it a bunch of times the best weed I've ever smoked probably still to today was in like the 1980s some chicken waitress got Hawaiian shit and it like
blew in the dark glowed in the dark it was just awesome yeah that was interesting
and then I have one other really cool book oh yeah actually I got another calendar right here
let's see what year this one is oh shit that one looks like heavy metal dude
that's awesome oh yeah this one's like
uh
it's a 77 cannabis calendar illustrated
it's like kiss that's where that looks like
look at this
oh yeah look at that they got oh is my camera working all right yep everything looks perfect to us
California gold of course it freezes okay
who that looks pretty good actually right never met her hey that looked better than some of the
the bud from the 80 calendar
right really went downhill in the 80s man
fucking reagan ruined weed right
now is that actually tied to a stick I never had I never got a tie stick like that I believe so
it's kind of hard to see yeah but the way um multiple people have described it they say
they get the stick and then like how it went down the uh middleman they break it in half
half and sell the other half of what they paid for it and I went hands eventually get down
for like no reason then book got ripped off but yeah I think it's cool all this old shit
Guadalajara seed pod and you can see man there's some bad-ass seeds and that shit
nobody trims man 70s butch all of it
oh damn there's a centerfold
man I would be how pissed would you be if your dealer brought you that
pretty upset
wow but I'm telling you
one time the buddy think um you know let's go in half on a thing I'll get some of this
this tie weed I'm like all right he comes back and the shit is black and it looks like strings
it looks literally like worse than this I'm like dude what did I just give you my money for so
he's like shut up so he rolled a toothpick and we got a whole bunch of these strings and he's like
well I don't know what to do with this I'm gonna get rid of it I'm gonna get rid of it I'm gonna
just shut up so he rolled a toothpick and we got fucked I was stoned for hours I was so amused
no I learned that same lesson early on I was like one of the bigger buys that I was making
so I was kind of like oh cool guy or you know feeling cool in my head at the time and they
kind of showed me a little something across the table and it almost looked like that and I looked
at him pissed off I was like you fucking serious like you fucking with me and they're just like
smoke it I smoked it grabbed it from across the table so thanks shut the fuck up
even some bugs they only express awesome on the first hit and then the next like the rest of it
is horrible I've had it so many times oh it's got to taste good from end to end but yeah no that was
my lesson of don't judge it by the cover because yeah it seriously it looked like some of these
things that we're seeing it was trimmed a little bit better but dude it fucking knocked my knock
my block off well like the contentment or something like that that makes me want to re-smoke
like it was there on the first hit when they sold me the bag and then when I got it home and it was
the same buds and I didn't get high from it I was like are you serious you know but it was like a
70 or 100 experience to know that that exists right well people do build up tolerances to strains
I love it the female I'm going like all of my stuff I try to get stuff that there is no tolerance
what is the name of this book towel
oh
sense of melia marijuana flowers okay it's a beautiful outdoor right there it's um
a 1976 publications by jim richardson yeah you find the biggest the big plant pictures like
and it's such a risk too at that time I mean to have photographic evidence and to print these I'm
sure they had to go probably to some printer out of the country to even to be able to print this
stuff in books uh pretty pretty balls that's a pretty deep that's right
but you get to focus but there's a couple pictures in here you could really see the height
you could really see the height that some of these plants get to
I could find them yeah you're right back in the uh there wasn't too many pictures like this back
then I guess no there was um I mean high times was kind of starting out I'm trying to think
of the magazine that um oh god I just spent two hours with them Tom Alexander
sense of milia tips that's the magazine um but those were really the only publications that
were putting uh putting out pictures and putting stuff out yep yep Tom Alexander
this guy behind that one so I don't know do you guys ever see um physical catalogs anymore
for seed companies personally I think there's one or two okay so so not many not not
definitely not what it used to be there
it's easier just to keep it up on the internet yeah yeah constant change but I loved you know
again like you know Tao's collection and you know I've got all these you know magazines back here
it's just fun to like sit here and flip through you know weed porn just looking at all the
different strains and you're like oh I remember that and that's you know like the backbone of
one of my favorite strains now so just having all this stuff to look through here's an old like th
seeds you know th seeds kind of like little blurb catalog going on it's just fun to have these
things and to collect them and you know you're not going to be able to buy them they're all gone
but yeah it's kind of cool stuff but I'm definitely jealous of all of your guys uh extensive uh
collections here outside of the seeds right buying it's it's but hey some of us have to
collect what the others can't have hey there you go and speaking of well you've got you've got a
full lineup there dominion going on oh yeah I showed off the burnout and the skunk band earlier
and I've I know I've shown these in the past but they're just such good good classics you know the
granny skunk dominion skunk monson yeah and with him you know being uh freed finally it's uh
it's nice actually I believe I saw a post of his on instagram about some of his older stock being
he's gonna let out uh he didn't say where or when just kind of oh you got to keep your eyes peeled
but uh follow him on instagram if uh if you're interested in getting some of these I know that
skunk band was on that list nice yeah I did I did recently see a see a post oh god I'm big not the
right one okay um I did recently see a post uh that things were dropping in the near future so
like you say follow these people closely and then and you'll get your chance but a lot of these
a lot of these things really are you know if they're not one and done they're they're
you know you limited release I guess that's a way to say it you very much it's like trying to get a
jordan or something like that you know getting the new the freshest pair of jordans you got to be
right there when they're dropped and be first in line or otherwise you're paying the secondary
market six hundred dollars for the shoes or you could go from the guy in the corner who has
everything that you want and it's only 10 bucks hey how does he do that how does he do those
fordons are nice those fordons that's all I've had better knockoffs than the original before
yeah that's true that's true yeah you're not getting exactly what you want but sometimes
you know I've said this on the show before there's a lot of white labeling uh in Spain and Europe and
I know uh when I got the pack that said like fruity runs from them that it was not runs
but that doesn't mean it was going to be bad and I was actually pleasantly surprised it came out
good um but yeah I they say it's around I know it's not and that's a hard thing to to keep tabs
on um just the older uh strains get because again well-meaning people with good intentions will
inadvertently pass bad information just happens it's very kind of you Jeff yeah you're welcome
you're welcome oh shit so what do we got there Jali oh you're Dutch street
the Dutch street yeah so like uh the thing is what sets a seed company apart is uh the
deed's knowledge right and uh some guys uh really long time ago they understood uh Fino influence on
their end product and on the first season of bro right and uh they work really hard and I'm pretty
sure Jordan of the islands works really hard to lock in their Fino and it's the same thing like
you can go back to when they first released like 30 years ago and it's the same Dutch street that
you've been getting the entire time because the guy has the same Fino you know and then other
dudes are outdoor and if you're outdoor then it's going to change every season you can have the same
mom and dad it's going to be a different end result and it's nobody really talks about it or
lets us know because I get pissed off man you know like I have nothing but time and and I have
totally gone on those tangents where I spent a bunch of money on a pack and uh I'm going through
all the forums and getting banned because I'm just like this guy you know got me something and he
said it was like this but the way he said it to me you know and and so now I'm really pissed off
because I spent you know like I could have eaten that money um and said I chose to buy the guy's
seeds and like come on man yeah yeah it's it's hard when you have to go off of uh just kind of
the face value of what they're telling you but then reputation reputation like the Jordan of
the aisle there again man that's just good breeding um that type of breeding takes time
it takes years um that's just is what it is some people do it other people's don't
look I'm hoping people hear this stuff you know and they're like okay I kind of want to check out
this guy's one-offs because he really he knows what he talks about and uh it seems into the light
you know to get the experience to to know what he's saying and it's it's like I'll say it to
anybody you know uh to people that you don't really want to say these kind of things to
because they're impulsively violent and stuff and I'll usually say it just because I mean it needs
to be said and uh it's amazing stuff man when you come across a company who understands vino and
gino and um the chemo bars and everything like that and the guy really takes the time
and they go and they they do a like for me a pheno hunt is growing it 50 different ways you know
like you got the miracle grow you got the aurora grow you got the house and gardens you know you
go through all the different lines and that's a pheno hunt um and then you have different
temperatures and stuff and um different growing mediums and that's a real pheno hunt but I really
I totally understand why dudes were all like pheno instead of gino because pheno sounds sexy
and ph and fat was like awesome man badass yeah no fat the fourtines the fourtines again
all comes back to the fourtines
yeah i'm selling fourtines and folex that's how I knew I got bad direction so tell me tau is it
like mandatory to give everybody who asks directions in New York the wrong ones because
any time I asked I got the wrong ones and I could usually tell because within three blocks they were
like Gucci Prada Rolex what you need I'm like yeah we went the wrong way again motherfucker
just go the opposite way
well that's the right way that's the right no um you know what's funny I stopped one time like
Queens somewhere and I asked the dude directions like I haven't gone 16 blocks from this spot
in my entire life the dude was like 40 years old I'm like oh okay so I guess you don't know how to
get to Long Island huh right yeah no I wound up in the projects one of those times off of the course
yeah yeah give me the wrong directions I wound up in the projects on one of them I didn't get too
deep in but I looked across the street and saw how two dudes were looking at me and I'm like
yeah this is definitely the wrong freaking direction I don't know where I'm going but
I'm going the other way yeah it's like man wasn't this in a Nas video or something
no I'm not even joking it was that it was the projects uh so yeah don't ask directions in New
York I don't know how I got on that one but don't that's from my national vacation
national lampoon vacation oh no I missed that I missed that one so for for Canada what's that
gorilla breath Humboldt seeds there bonus there I got a bunch of their last stuff before they got
kicked out for like a year or whatever and I got all of their their last stock
so what what is maybe something uh on the table that you've popped jolly that you can kind of
tell us about maybe how it grew and if it lived up to your expectations as far as flavor uh and taste
and you know maybe even yield is is there anything out there right now that you you've popped that
you still have like me and Dave we're talking we always keep two seeds you know if you have a 10
pack pop eight keep two seeds you never know so are you part of the two seed club as well
yeah I mean like uh this sour crypt and uh um the pck like I kept some of those and then I re-bought
um and then this dude like this is my third pack of his kawaii electric and then humble
like this is fine I only popped two of them and I mean it was delicious you know like it
it's a Durban poison I'm amped when I smoke it I can charge nice that's a fun one and you pulled
the fruity fruity taste off of the Durban there yeah something like that you know I have a hard
time with my Somali terms um but it was like a desirable like something that I want to keep on
inhaling but I can't because I'm just going to get too amped out and I got nothing to do
this one right here it's called citrus swell it's uh skittles crossed with asian orange
and I didn't think it was going to be as radical as it ended up being
and like I only popped like one seed of it or maybe two and it was radical you know like the
next day I would wake up straight in like 250 mics you know everybody who smoked it woke up
the next day tripping you know like they did really amazing old school psychedelics just
tripping and I still have a couple of those in here nice I've grown a lot of the Asian oranges
directly from TGA always been happy always been impressed with that one
yeah and then this one right here like I think I'm the only guy who's got electric storm anymore
even the original breeder guy who doesn't have any more of his electric storm and it was just
awesome it's like kawaii electric crossed with tropical og or something like that and uh
it was super homo zagonis like two plants expressed exactly the same and the early cut that I did
had the flavor and everything like that and then when I cut it later it acquired a contaminant
in a rain and the flavor was gone but the high was there and the high was awesome and I'm still I
have like like 10 10 left and like it was really like noteworthy buds yeah this one was so good
it got ripped I did a project with this mix with uh multi frost and that was going to be
our like premium um freebie because I always thought like freebie was supposed to be like
the loudest most insane stuff that you had and it was so insane that it stunk for blocks
and somebody came and ripped it you know I found out later it was like a renowned ripper and I was
like oh it's it's kind of cool you know like he's a renowned asshole everybody knows it
oh that sucks but I'm sure they ripped many people's plants you know like uh and the hardcore
dudes and stuff and he went for it and I was like you you ripped my plant like I feel honored bro
right right it's like when you get haters on the internet you're like I guess I'm doing something
right yeah you were just growing the dank and the rippers like you know I could have ripped off 20
other people but I chose you you should be honored okay fuck off and I segregated that plant
like two weeks before thinking something like this was gonna happen I was like oh yeah well
yeah next time next time next time I'll listen to my intuition when it told me to cut a couple
of branches off because it might happen and I didn't do it and uh and we totally lost all like
it was a year of work because I wanted to show people like if you pheno out of genetic it becomes
its own thing but it can keep like beautiful parts of its original self but once you alter the genetic
code it's like its own thing entirely and then it was crossed with all these amazing things that
just amp it up you know because we want you to be the same on every toke that's what I'm always
trying to get is stuff that no matter what from the first toke to the last toke and 10 pounds in
and more you're always um always getting you there you know yeah yep well I do want to just kind of
say you know let everybody know that we're running late we're running uh much later than we normally
do and I just want to be respective of Tao and Dave of your time I know you guys are in a later
time zone than I am so I appreciate you staying and I appreciate you hanging out um were there any
uh anything that you wanted to get up uh for this episode I know Dave you're you're the
you're the co-host dude so uh you're you're gonna be on the next one as well I I hope I'm asking you
now so you'll have another chance but uh it looks like actually I'm gonna skip over you now
but because Tao's got something no disrespect I'm just playing with you it's all good all good
we're we're the we're the freaking Bartles and James of Seedworld I guess so let me let me blow
up Tao's here real quick he's got he's got more going oh I know what these are tell us Tao what
are we looking at? Yeah some of those cards are referred to so these are um they're called inline
hemp cards and there was two uh two years of them there's series one which we're looking at and then
