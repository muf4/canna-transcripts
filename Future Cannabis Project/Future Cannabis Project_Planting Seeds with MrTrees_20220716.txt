[00:00.000 --> 00:01.280]  good connectivity there, Nick.
[00:02.560 --> 00:03.560]  Hi, everybody.
[00:03.840 --> 00:04.840]  And.
[00:05.560 --> 00:07.600]  I'm down here, so we're live
[00:07.600 --> 00:09.000]  or we're hanging out, Mr.
[00:09.000 --> 00:10.280]  Treason probably during some point,
[00:10.280 --> 00:12.180]  or if not worse, cool enough to hang
[00:12.200 --> 00:13.680]  out. So, yeah, dudes,
[00:14.120 --> 00:15.120]  how's it going?
[00:15.760 --> 00:17.880]  We are visiting Nick's garden
[00:17.880 --> 00:19.480]  right now, and he was just telling us
[00:19.480 --> 00:20.260]  about his plants.
[00:20.280 --> 00:21.200]  And I was just like, well, you know
[00:21.200 --> 00:22.400]  what? Fuck, let's just start the
[00:22.400 --> 00:23.560]  show. We're a few minutes late.
[00:24.800 --> 00:25.920]  What's going on here, Nick?
[00:25.920 --> 00:27.240]  Because they look pretty and they
[00:27.240 --> 00:28.600]  look well, they look dead asleep
[00:28.600 --> 00:30.240]  right now, not dead, but asleep.
[00:30.280 --> 00:31.360]  Like they're taking a nap for the
[00:31.360 --> 00:32.400]  evening. But they look like they've
[00:32.400 --> 00:33.600]  had a full day of sun.
[00:33.880 --> 00:34.840]  What are you growing in?
[00:34.840 --> 00:36.280]  What what's in front of us?
[00:36.280 --> 00:37.320]  And what's special about these
[00:37.320 --> 00:38.320]  plants?
[00:39.360 --> 00:41.640]  So I grow in living soil, everything's
[00:41.640 --> 00:42.960]  totally organic.
[00:43.280 --> 00:45.360]  I like to say beyond organic because.
[00:46.320 --> 00:48.240]  The MRI will prove anything,
[00:49.200 --> 00:51.080]  but anyway, you know, we got
[00:51.080 --> 00:52.760]  our mulch down, it's about two
[00:52.760 --> 00:54.580]  inches thick, really, man,
[00:54.600 --> 00:56.360]  we've been reaching temperatures of
[00:56.360 --> 00:58.000]  about one hundred and four
[00:58.440 --> 01:00.440]  with one hundred and sixteen
[01:00.440 --> 01:01.800]  degree heat index.
[01:01.800 --> 01:02.800]  So I've been just
[01:03.760 --> 01:05.680]  mulching, mulching, man,
[01:05.680 --> 01:06.960]  as much as I can.
[01:07.320 --> 01:09.200]  And all the grass is dead
[01:09.200 --> 01:11.040]  now. So, I mean, good thing I
[01:11.040 --> 01:12.040]  got that down
[01:13.160 --> 01:15.080]  and doing compost teas,
[01:15.720 --> 01:17.620]  trying to break that microbial life
[01:17.640 --> 01:18.640]  up on the leaf.
[01:19.760 --> 01:21.760]  This in particular is a fifty
[01:21.760 --> 01:22.760]  fifty.
[01:22.960 --> 01:24.720]  This is a strawberry glue
[01:24.720 --> 01:26.680]  cookie. So strawberry cough
[01:26.680 --> 01:28.440]  times gorilla glue times
[01:28.440 --> 01:29.520]  Girl Scout cookies.
[01:29.520 --> 01:31.560]  It's a variety that I made myself.
[01:33.120 --> 01:34.960]  These are three clones.
[01:35.800 --> 01:37.120]  They're all different.
[01:37.440 --> 01:39.080]  This one is in particular.
[01:39.080 --> 01:40.640]  This is a feminine seed.
[01:41.000 --> 01:42.840]  It's a plant that I've held around.
[01:42.840 --> 01:44.840]  The yield is really minimal, but
[01:45.120 --> 01:47.400]  it's phenomenal weed.
[01:47.920 --> 01:49.560]  This is the one that started me on
[01:49.560 --> 01:51.520]  the project with the strawberries
[01:51.520 --> 01:53.200]  for people that have MS.
[01:54.320 --> 01:56.080]  You know, they're down.
[01:56.720 --> 01:58.240]  It's a day to day basis.
[01:58.240 --> 02:00.000]  People struggle some
[02:00.000 --> 02:01.640]  days and they're fine the next.
[02:01.640 --> 02:03.480]  And all you can
[02:03.480 --> 02:05.240]  really do for them is alleviate
[02:05.240 --> 02:07.320]  their pain and give
[02:07.320 --> 02:09.360]  them maybe a little bit of creative
[02:09.560 --> 02:10.560]  stimulant
[02:11.800 --> 02:13.600]  to maybe get out a coloring
[02:13.600 --> 02:14.600]  book or
[02:15.800 --> 02:17.600]  be creative, you know, and
[02:18.080 --> 02:19.480]  and just kind of lay around the
[02:19.480 --> 02:21.440]  house, but hopefully
[02:21.440 --> 02:22.720]  feel better about yourself.
[02:22.720 --> 02:24.200]  I mean, I feel better every time I
[02:24.200 --> 02:25.200]  smoke weed.
[02:25.640 --> 02:27.280]  So, you know,
[02:27.840 --> 02:29.320]  I could be having a horrible day.
[02:29.320 --> 02:30.680]  I smoke some weed and I'm having a
[02:30.680 --> 02:31.680]  great day. So
[02:33.240 --> 02:35.520]  these are the three varieties.
[02:35.520 --> 02:36.320]  They're all different.
[02:36.320 --> 02:38.600]  These two are regular seeds.
[02:38.600 --> 02:40.480]  So I'm doing a little
[02:40.480 --> 02:42.280]  reversal back cross with the first
[02:42.280 --> 02:44.120]  one. And then these two, I
[02:44.120 --> 02:45.960]  have a few males that I've
[02:45.960 --> 02:47.400]  chucked pollen to.
[02:49.760 --> 02:50.920]  So, Corey,
[02:51.640 --> 02:52.640]  you remember.
[02:53.640 --> 02:55.600]  I can't think of his name off the
[02:55.600 --> 02:57.280]  top of my head, but first Republic
[02:57.280 --> 02:58.280]  seeds.
[02:59.760 --> 03:01.600]  We talked about the farmhouse and
[03:01.600 --> 03:02.600]  stuff.
[03:02.920 --> 03:04.400]  Well, this is Mr.
[03:04.400 --> 03:05.160]  Fusion.
[03:05.160 --> 03:07.160]  This is this feminized seed
[03:07.640 --> 03:09.040]  of Mr. Fusion.
[03:09.360 --> 03:11.640]  This one is phenomenal.
[03:13.120 --> 03:14.120]  Look at that.
[03:14.320 --> 03:15.480]  These are from seed.
[03:15.920 --> 03:17.120]  They're not clones.
[03:19.280 --> 03:20.680]  That's some pretty weed, London.
[03:23.160 --> 03:24.160]  Thank you, buddy.
[03:24.160 --> 03:25.160]  Thank you.
[03:25.600 --> 03:26.880]  I think your weed's prettier.
[03:28.120 --> 03:29.040]  This one died.
[03:29.040 --> 03:29.960]  I don't know what happened.
[03:29.960 --> 03:31.760]  I sprayed a compost tea and the next
[03:31.760 --> 03:33.680]  day, like wilted over and it
[03:33.680 --> 03:34.680]  was gone.
[03:34.800 --> 03:35.800]  Gone.
[03:38.000 --> 03:39.000]  This is
[03:40.320 --> 03:42.320]  GMO times Casey
[03:42.320 --> 03:43.320]  Jones.
[03:43.520 --> 03:45.560]  Casey Jones had two more things.
[03:45.800 --> 03:47.200]  Well, five more things that he
[03:47.200 --> 03:48.840]  wanted to ride before he died.
[03:48.880 --> 03:50.840]  He had a tricycle, bicycle,
[03:50.840 --> 03:52.760]  automobile and a bowlegged woman
[03:53.160 --> 03:54.160]  on a Ferris wheel.
[03:56.760 --> 03:57.840]  She ugly, man.
[03:58.560 --> 04:00.120]  A lot of a lot of those a lot of
[04:00.120 --> 04:02.040]  those one one leave things.
[04:02.040 --> 04:03.640]  I've got I've got a I got a one
[04:03.640 --> 04:05.440]  that's a revenge right now from
[04:05.440 --> 04:07.280]  that I put out in fucking like June
[04:07.920 --> 04:09.560]  or something like ridiculous, like
[04:09.560 --> 04:11.320]  not June, like January,
[04:11.320 --> 04:12.720]  February, like mid-February.
[04:12.720 --> 04:14.680]  I put her out and just like to see
[04:14.680 --> 04:15.520]  if she would survive.
[04:15.520 --> 04:16.520]  And she totally did.
[04:16.800 --> 04:18.320]  No rot. No problem.
[04:18.320 --> 04:19.320]  She survived.
[04:19.360 --> 04:20.640]  And now she's morphing back.
[04:20.640 --> 04:21.640]  I'm like, OK, cool.
[04:22.000 --> 04:23.200]  Hey, Peter, how's it going?
[04:25.120 --> 04:27.120]  We see you lurking.
[04:28.120 --> 04:30.040]  So these are my twelve plants.
[04:30.080 --> 04:31.800]  I always run 13 one.
[04:31.960 --> 04:33.680]  Some always happens to one.
[04:33.680 --> 04:35.040]  So, you know,
[04:35.520 --> 04:37.000]  it goes right here in the fourth
[04:37.000 --> 04:38.840]  hole. And if one makes
[04:38.840 --> 04:40.240]  it, I'll just pull the weakest link.
[04:40.240 --> 04:41.240]  But these are pre-98
[04:42.240 --> 04:43.160]  Bubba Kush.
[04:43.160 --> 04:44.160]  This is a
[04:45.040 --> 04:46.040]  a I like
[04:46.920 --> 04:48.560]  to say veteran cut.
[04:50.920 --> 04:52.680]  Of pre-98 Bubba,
[04:52.680 --> 04:53.800]  this came from a.
[04:55.040 --> 04:56.760]  A guy that knows Kevin Jodrey
[04:56.760 --> 04:58.760]  actually did
[04:58.760 --> 05:00.560]  a bunch of projects with him, this is
[05:00.840 --> 05:02.880]  pre-98 Bubba times skunk
[05:02.880 --> 05:03.880]  18.
[05:04.080 --> 05:06.480]  This one is a one leaf variety.
[05:06.480 --> 05:07.800]  I sprayed him a sulfur
[05:08.720 --> 05:10.200]  because it's too hot to be spraying
[05:10.200 --> 05:12.320]  neem and Kranja, but I do
[05:12.320 --> 05:14.400]  rather spray neem and Kranja.
[05:14.840 --> 05:16.400]  But yeah, this one leaf for man,
[05:16.640 --> 05:17.640]  there's something about it.
[05:17.640 --> 05:19.000]  I think it's really special.
[05:21.040 --> 05:22.320]  But yeah, this is my garden.
[05:22.320 --> 05:23.600]  This is my side deal.
[05:23.640 --> 05:25.400]  My dad and I, I'm teaching
[05:25.400 --> 05:26.720]  my dad how to grow.
[05:27.040 --> 05:28.840]  And we do a giant
[05:28.840 --> 05:30.000]  tomato garden.
[05:30.000 --> 05:31.720]  I got like, hmm.
[05:31.960 --> 05:33.960]  Well, I told you I grow like almost
[05:33.960 --> 05:36.000]  a thousand pounds of tomatoes, but
[05:38.080 --> 05:40.160]  few of them didn't get cages.
[05:44.770 --> 05:46.330]  But they're about nine foot tall
[05:46.330 --> 05:47.330]  right now.
[05:48.130 --> 05:50.210]  Nice. My my my outside
[05:50.210 --> 05:51.690]  tomatoes are doing terrible, but I
[05:51.690 --> 05:53.170]  got I got some pretty good good
[05:53.490 --> 05:55.330]  long straight vines and tomatoes
[05:55.330 --> 05:56.410]  right now that are killing it.
[05:56.770 --> 05:57.770]  I'm super pumped.
[06:00.530 --> 06:02.370]  They're all heirloom varieties.
[06:02.370 --> 06:04.370]  I breed my own tomatoes,
[06:05.010 --> 06:06.850]  so I take Baker Creek
[06:07.690 --> 06:09.570]  seeds and I'll just, you
[06:09.570 --> 06:11.410]  know, get them close
[06:11.410 --> 06:13.410]  and then run through different
[06:13.770 --> 06:15.730]  tomatoes that I've kept kind
[06:15.730 --> 06:17.690]  of particularly ones
[06:17.690 --> 06:19.490]  that may have a little rot spot on
[06:19.490 --> 06:21.450]  them or guy eating on a little
[06:21.450 --> 06:22.450]  bit and
[06:23.450 --> 06:25.010]  I run them and then I'll pick the
[06:25.010 --> 06:26.650]  best from the years before this
[06:26.650 --> 06:28.450]  early grow variety
[06:28.450 --> 06:30.170]  is just I know
[06:30.170 --> 06:31.490]  we're talking about pot, but look at
[06:31.490 --> 06:33.410]  this thing like.
[06:35.730 --> 06:36.730]  No, I do.
[06:36.770 --> 06:38.450]  I can love to me, I love tomatoes,
[06:38.450 --> 06:39.610]  I love getting into all the other
[06:39.610 --> 06:41.370]  stuff. I mean, it's there's as
[06:41.370 --> 06:42.930]  much many different varieties and
[06:42.930 --> 06:44.530]  fun stuff to get into with that, too.
[06:45.370 --> 06:46.410]  Do you guys have anything?
[06:46.410 --> 06:47.690]  Peter's like, oh, I got
[06:47.690 --> 06:48.730]  caterpillar, but we've got some
[06:48.730 --> 06:49.730]  outdoor growers here.
[06:50.090 --> 06:51.610]  Like so I mean,
[06:51.970 --> 06:53.250]  what's your how do you deal
[06:53.570 --> 06:55.210]  with preventative prevention of
[06:55.210 --> 06:56.530]  caterpillar? What you get one like?
[06:56.530 --> 06:58.050]  I mean, like these guys,
[06:59.210 --> 07:00.890]  you know, I really didn't get to it
[07:00.890 --> 07:02.890]  this year because I've been having
[07:02.890 --> 07:04.690]  a bunch of breeding projects.
[07:04.690 --> 07:06.250]  But normally I do.
[07:06.250 --> 07:08.010]  These are just things that popped up
[07:08.010 --> 07:10.290]  that my dad kind of did mow over,
[07:10.610 --> 07:12.490]  but a bunch of sunflowers, man.
[07:12.490 --> 07:14.450]  Normally we have about five
[07:14.450 --> 07:16.410]  hundred sunflowers
[07:16.410 --> 07:18.330]  we plant and then I go through
[07:18.330 --> 07:20.130]  and I'll dry them out, set them
[07:20.130 --> 07:21.130]  on a rock,
[07:21.890 --> 07:23.690]  take bamboo and beat the seeds
[07:23.690 --> 07:24.690]  out of them.
[07:26.210 --> 07:28.010]  But this one, they're all giants.
[07:28.210 --> 07:29.810]  But this one in particular
[07:30.570 --> 07:32.570]  is a giant, but
[07:33.050 --> 07:34.650]  it's got a little head compared to
[07:34.650 --> 07:36.650]  the rest. It's I'm actually
[07:36.650 --> 07:38.250]  definitely going to keep this one to
[07:38.250 --> 07:40.170]  the side and then I'm going
[07:40.170 --> 07:42.010]  to buy some more from Baker
[07:42.010 --> 07:43.850]  Seeds. But yeah, we'll we'll
[07:43.850 --> 07:45.370]  line this thing up.
[07:45.370 --> 07:47.090]  It's normally like I wish
[07:47.090 --> 07:48.890]  I could have sent you some pictures,
[07:48.890 --> 07:50.330]  but we'll
[07:51.530 --> 07:53.450]  just outline the whole garden
[07:53.450 --> 07:55.250]  and sunflowers and then we'll plant
[07:55.250 --> 07:57.130]  the marigolds in the corners right
[07:57.130 --> 07:57.890]  here.
[07:57.890 --> 07:59.690]  Watermelons grew up just kind of
[07:59.690 --> 08:00.690]  randomly, but
[08:02.130 --> 08:04.290]  man, just beneficial plants.
[08:04.290 --> 08:05.530]  So, you know, you got to have your
[08:05.530 --> 08:07.010]  mulch, you got to have your cover
[08:07.010 --> 08:09.010]  crops. It's you're not going to win
[08:09.010 --> 08:10.410]  if you think that you're going to
[08:10.410 --> 08:12.010]  win with sprays.
[08:12.850 --> 08:14.810]  You know, you can only keep
[08:14.810 --> 08:15.810]  them at bay.
[08:17.250 --> 08:19.090]  And I firmly believe that you're
[08:19.090 --> 08:21.010]  building an ecosystem and
[08:21.010 --> 08:22.410]  you're just going to have to thrive
[08:22.410 --> 08:24.090]  by the ones that thrive off the
[08:24.090 --> 08:25.090]  others.
[08:26.050 --> 08:28.050]  And so, you
[08:28.050 --> 08:30.490]  know, you plant your rosemary
[08:30.490 --> 08:33.250]  and stuff for your spider
[08:33.250 --> 08:35.610]  mites and get that out of the garden
[08:35.610 --> 08:37.650]  and you get up with your sunflowers
[08:37.650 --> 08:40.250]  and it brings in those parasitic
[08:40.250 --> 08:42.450]  wasps and they do a number
[08:42.450 --> 08:44.250]  on all the caterpillars.
[08:44.250 --> 08:46.250]  But look, I got caterpillars.
[08:47.410 --> 08:48.410]  Well.
[08:48.850 --> 08:50.490]  All over those.
[08:51.170 --> 08:53.090]  And I'd way rather have them over
[08:53.090 --> 08:54.570]  here on these.
[08:55.730 --> 08:57.650]  Then all my plants, but
[08:57.650 --> 08:59.530]  for a secondary thing,
[08:59.530 --> 09:01.530]  man, them dynatraps, you know,
[09:01.530 --> 09:02.810]  I got one right here.
[09:02.810 --> 09:04.850]  It's on the edge of the garden
[09:04.850 --> 09:06.970]  with these sunflowers
[09:06.970 --> 09:07.970]  and
[09:09.090 --> 09:11.250]  this little dynatrap is
[09:11.250 --> 09:13.330]  made for about one acre
[09:13.330 --> 09:14.330]  and
[09:15.770 --> 09:17.650]  it I've when you
[09:17.650 --> 09:19.330]  empty this out, you can actually
[09:19.330 --> 09:21.410]  empty this out on a full moon night
[09:22.410 --> 09:24.610]  and cast it over your plants
[09:24.610 --> 09:26.250]  like a it's
[09:26.250 --> 09:27.770]  kind of some witchery stuff, but you
[09:27.770 --> 09:29.930]  can cast it over your plants and
[09:29.930 --> 09:32.090]  just like some insect frass and
[09:32.090 --> 09:34.170]  it really deters them.
[09:34.170 --> 09:36.130]  If you do it biodynamically,
[09:38.210 --> 09:40.290]  I really firmly believe that.
[09:40.290 --> 09:42.170]  And I and then, you know, I do
[09:42.170 --> 09:44.810]  use insect frass with my compost.
[09:44.810 --> 09:45.810]  It's a great
[09:46.570 --> 09:48.410]  a great element to use in
[09:48.410 --> 09:49.410]  the garden. I
[09:51.490 --> 09:52.970]  can't get enough of it, actually.
[09:54.170 --> 09:55.610]  But you can only use it like once
[09:55.610 --> 09:57.130]  every eight weeks because it's high
[09:57.130 --> 09:59.090]  in nitrogen and you don't
[09:59.090 --> 10:01.210]  want to do too much foliar, you
[10:01.210 --> 10:02.210]  know.
[10:05.660 --> 10:06.660]  But yeah, I really like this
[10:06.660 --> 10:07.460]  strawberry variety.
[10:07.460 --> 10:08.700]  It's it's my favorite.
[10:08.700 --> 10:09.900]  It's the only thing that I've kept
[10:09.900 --> 10:11.940]  around for like six
[10:11.940 --> 10:12.940]  years now.
[10:14.340 --> 10:16.340]  You know, this is one of the plants
[10:16.340 --> 10:17.900]  that I risked my life for growing
[10:17.900 --> 10:20.140]  before it was before it was legal.
[10:20.140 --> 10:21.140]  This one right here.
[10:22.740 --> 10:24.380]  And now that I'm able to sift
[10:24.380 --> 10:26.140]  through enough genetics to breed
[10:26.140 --> 10:28.100]  back to it and maybe find something
[10:28.100 --> 10:30.140]  that'll pair well with it
[10:30.140 --> 10:31.420]  and do what I want.
[10:33.660 --> 10:35.740]  You know, for what I want it like
[10:35.740 --> 10:37.380]  I have a few things I'm doing and
[10:37.380 --> 10:39.300]  one is for MS, the other ones
[10:39.300 --> 10:40.300]  for
[10:41.140 --> 10:43.460]  a fungal and bacteria dominant,
[10:43.460 --> 10:45.620]  like people that have parasitic
[10:45.620 --> 10:47.780]  problems and
[10:47.820 --> 10:50.340]  or irrelevant bowel movements.
[10:52.860 --> 10:54.700]  So there's a few that I've just
[10:54.700 --> 10:56.780]  selected and I'm I
[10:56.780 --> 10:58.500]  have people that come to me and they
[10:58.500 --> 11:00.340]  have problems and they and I
[11:00.340 --> 11:02.100]  if I think that I have something
[11:02.100 --> 11:03.900]  that might work for them, I
[11:03.900 --> 11:05.460]  I just try it.
[11:05.460 --> 11:06.740]  Give them some weed to smoke.
[11:07.900 --> 11:09.300]  See if it works for them.
[11:13.260 --> 11:15.140]  Are you are you running a
[11:15.140 --> 11:17.580]  strawberry cough based
[11:17.620 --> 11:18.620]  strain, right?
[11:20.700 --> 11:22.460]  Yeah, that's that was
[11:22.460 --> 11:24.460]  the the mother of all mothers
[11:24.460 --> 11:25.500]  with strawberry cough.
[11:25.500 --> 11:27.540]  That's my favorite strain.
[11:27.540 --> 11:28.700]  It's fun.
[11:28.700 --> 11:30.500]  Oh, it's fucking hilarious because
[11:30.500 --> 11:33.100]  the first medical marijuana
[11:33.100 --> 11:35.540]  I ever smoked to actual
[11:35.540 --> 11:37.260]  first like medical.
[11:37.260 --> 11:39.540]  I'd smoke weed before, but
[11:39.540 --> 11:42.780]  the first medical was
[11:42.780 --> 11:45.300]  some strawberry.
[11:45.300 --> 11:47.540]  It was strawberry haze from
[11:48.540 --> 11:50.740]  the greenhouse.
[11:50.740 --> 11:52.500]  So it was strawberry cross
[11:52.500 --> 11:54.180]  strawberry cough
[11:54.180 --> 11:56.340]  cross with NL five haze
[11:56.340 --> 11:57.340]  mist.
[11:58.100 --> 11:59.100]  And
[12:00.780 --> 12:02.860]  it was like the most
[12:02.860 --> 12:05.260]  like absolutely
[12:05.260 --> 12:07.260]  like lightning
[12:07.260 --> 12:09.540]  like medicine fucking just
[12:09.540 --> 12:11.540]  open your eyes
[12:11.540 --> 12:13.740]  like fucking amazing ****
[12:13.740 --> 12:14.740]  in the world.
[12:18.340 --> 12:20.260]  Sorry, there's like a slasher
[12:20.260 --> 12:22.100]  bit thing going on right now, and I
[12:22.100 --> 12:23.860]  just like
[12:23.860 --> 12:25.540]  if there was a field that I would
[12:25.540 --> 12:27.180]  like to be chased by a murderer
[12:27.180 --> 12:28.300]  through, it's this one.
[12:28.300 --> 12:30.260]  I'm just going to say that right now.
[12:33.940 --> 12:35.380]  You're going to hide right now,
[12:35.380 --> 12:36.380]  London.
[12:38.500 --> 12:39.980]  Sorry, I totally cut you off,
[12:39.980 --> 12:40.980]  Coastal Grown.
[12:40.980 --> 12:42.180]  My apologies.
[12:42.180 --> 12:43.180]  You were saying.
[12:43.180 --> 12:44.460]  It's cool. It's cool.
[12:44.460 --> 12:46.860]  I was like, yeah, I way
[12:46.860 --> 12:48.700]  back in like 2007,
[12:48.700 --> 12:50.020]  like the first time I fucking
[12:50.020 --> 12:51.980]  smoked some like strawberry haze,
[12:51.980 --> 12:54.100]  it was which was like basically
[12:54.100 --> 12:55.940]  a strawberry cough, fucking
[12:55.940 --> 12:57.980]  client, a clone cross
[12:57.980 --> 12:59.820]  with it was
[12:59.820 --> 13:01.140]  an L five haze mist.
[13:03.060 --> 13:05.020]  It basically it's this very
[13:05.020 --> 13:06.940]  similar fucking cross,
[13:06.940 --> 13:09.740]  and it was it was this like so
[13:09.740 --> 13:11.940]  like medical.
[13:11.940 --> 13:13.500]  It was very medical.
[13:13.500 --> 13:15.060]  And it's funny that he mentions
[13:15.060 --> 13:17.180]  that it's medical because
[13:17.180 --> 13:19.340]  like it really
[13:19.340 --> 13:21.180]  had that was the fucking first
[13:21.180 --> 13:23.140]  thing that I felt like made me
[13:23.140 --> 13:25.540]  feel like we actually
[13:25.540 --> 13:27.620]  made me feel
[13:27.620 --> 13:29.340]  medically better because
[13:29.340 --> 13:30.820]  the rest of the time I was just
[13:30.820 --> 13:33.580]  smoking weed to just get high
[13:33.580 --> 13:35.580]  and get fucked up and
[13:35.580 --> 13:37.500]  and not so much to feel
[13:37.500 --> 13:38.660]  like better.
[13:38.660 --> 13:40.620]  And then that actually like
[13:40.620 --> 13:42.380]  made me feel like, wow,
[13:42.380 --> 13:44.260]  like something actually happened in
[13:44.300 --> 13:44.980]  my brain.
[13:44.980 --> 13:47.220]  And it does.
[13:47.220 --> 13:49.140]  Yeah, so I understand
[13:49.140 --> 13:50.860]  what he's saying and what he's
[13:50.860 --> 13:51.700]  talking about.
[13:51.700 --> 13:54.020]  And it's just like it really
[13:54.020 --> 13:55.100]  that strawberry
[13:56.060 --> 13:57.900]  it really, really, really
[13:57.900 --> 13:59.780]  has a thing to it.
[13:59.780 --> 14:01.820]  And they use it in GW,
[14:01.820 --> 14:03.260]  I think, pharmaceuticals.
[14:05.260 --> 14:06.980]  For some of their fucking
[14:06.980 --> 14:09.260]  hybrids, but they
[14:09.260 --> 14:11.140]  they've kind of tried to hide what
[14:11.140 --> 14:12.700]  they're doing now.
[14:12.700 --> 14:13.700]  They don't.
[14:14.940 --> 14:16.820]  But you kind of talk
[14:16.820 --> 14:19.140]  a little bit more, especially
[14:19.140 --> 14:21.060]  when Franco and.
[14:22.820 --> 14:25.220]  Ariane were more involved,
[14:25.220 --> 14:26.220]  but yeah.
[14:30.500 --> 14:32.620]  I don't want to get too
[14:32.620 --> 14:33.620]  far into that.
[14:40.060 --> 14:41.220]  Inside plants, too.
[14:42.780 --> 14:44.580]  Yeah, OK, shit, I got to read,
[14:44.580 --> 14:46.020]  I got to read up the screen here.
[14:46.020 --> 14:47.020]  My apologies.
[14:47.620 --> 14:57.710]  So yeah, I got a bunch of.
[15:00.910 --> 15:01.910]  Varieties.
[15:04.070 --> 15:06.910]  This one, it's actually
[15:06.910 --> 15:09.110]  Russ Brandon's TK, TK,
[15:09.110 --> 15:11.510]  LB or TK, TK
[15:11.510 --> 15:14.030]  times NL five
[15:14.030 --> 15:16.310]  times on Hayes and then
[15:16.310 --> 15:18.830]  we have a line one BX
[15:18.830 --> 15:20.830]  that was Jackson's from.
[15:20.830 --> 15:23.110]  Can you do me a favor and just
[15:23.110 --> 15:24.310]  slow down?
[15:24.310 --> 15:26.350]  Slow down on camera as
[15:26.350 --> 15:27.350]  much as you can.
[15:27.350 --> 15:29.350]  Take some nice big pauses
[15:29.350 --> 15:31.430]  like right in a couple good zones.
[15:31.430 --> 15:33.230]  Don't try and like
[15:33.230 --> 15:34.950]  slow it down a little bit.
[15:37.830 --> 15:39.550]  Everybody gets so excited to show
[15:39.550 --> 15:41.150]  everything so quickly that it kind
[15:41.150 --> 15:42.950]  of like we get a little jumpy back
[15:42.950 --> 15:43.950]  and forth.
[15:44.990 --> 15:46.870]  Yeah, like just like pause
[15:46.870 --> 15:47.870]  right there.
[15:48.710 --> 15:50.630]  And then like tell me all about
[15:50.630 --> 15:51.630]  it, baby.
[15:52.630 --> 15:53.630]  I'm sorry,
[15:53.630 --> 15:54.630]  that's just so lame.
[15:58.630 --> 16:00.630]  Can you tell me about it, Nick?
[16:02.030 --> 16:03.870]  Yeah, you're breaking up a little bit.
[16:03.870 --> 16:05.670]  Am I am I lagging?
[16:06.390 --> 16:07.390]  A little bit.
[16:09.510 --> 16:11.030]  How am I coming through, guys?
[16:12.270 --> 16:13.270]  Better now.
[16:13.310 --> 16:14.310]  I think it was me.
[16:17.230 --> 16:18.230]  That was gorgeous.
[16:18.230 --> 16:19.230]  What you got going?
[16:19.350 --> 16:21.350]  So this is Russ
[16:21.350 --> 16:23.350]  Brandon's TKTK
[16:23.390 --> 16:24.390]  times
[16:25.230 --> 16:27.150]  Northern Lights number five
[16:27.150 --> 16:29.510]  times on Hayes times
[16:30.390 --> 16:32.230]  Jackson's line one back
[16:32.230 --> 16:34.230]  cross Jackson from
[16:34.230 --> 16:36.230]  Mean Gene, you know,
[16:36.230 --> 16:37.230]  freeborn selection.
[16:38.230 --> 16:40.230]  That's this is his
[16:40.230 --> 16:42.230]  and Russ Brandon's
[16:44.910 --> 16:45.910]  are seeds right here.
[16:45.910 --> 16:47.910]  So this is his
[16:48.030 --> 16:50.150]  are seeds right here
[16:50.150 --> 16:52.150]  that are Brandon's.
[16:55.590 --> 16:56.910]  And here's another
[16:56.910 --> 16:57.910]  horrible.
[17:00.750 --> 17:02.430]  Was I coming through creepy?
[17:04.150 --> 17:05.430]  Am I cleaner now?
[17:05.430 --> 17:06.430]  Yeah.
[17:07.870 --> 17:09.390]  All right, I had two mics on.
[17:09.390 --> 17:10.390]  That was my fault.
[17:15.190 --> 17:16.710]  And these are just plants, brother.
[17:16.710 --> 17:17.710]  So this is a.
[17:19.110 --> 17:21.110]  Thank you. This is nine pound hammer
[17:21.150 --> 17:22.350]  and it's not a very great.
[17:22.350 --> 17:23.350]  You.
[17:24.630 --> 17:25.750]  Elder, but.
[17:28.590 --> 17:30.390]  Is that James Ruth nine pound
[17:30.390 --> 17:31.390]  hammer?
[17:32.630 --> 17:34.430]  Yes, these are my Finos
[17:34.430 --> 17:36.110]  through about fifteen
[17:36.110 --> 17:37.110]  hundred seeds.
[17:37.750 --> 17:39.350]  Do I have six?
[17:40.830 --> 17:41.830]  This is so when
[17:42.790 --> 17:43.790]  I bought.
[17:47.530 --> 17:48.410]  Whose was it?
[17:48.410 --> 17:49.410]  Emerald
[17:50.450 --> 17:52.210]  Emerald Mountain seeds, I had
[17:52.210 --> 17:54.290]  a spice cream that I was doing
[17:54.290 --> 17:56.090]  to breed with the
[17:56.090 --> 17:57.290]  lime or from
[17:57.290 --> 17:58.290]  Russ Brandon.
[17:59.050 --> 18:00.050]  And I was gifted
[18:01.090 --> 18:02.850]  some green cauliflower
[18:02.850 --> 18:03.650]  seeds.
[18:03.650 --> 18:05.490]  And then I was gifted
[18:05.490 --> 18:07.610]  this mango cookies
[18:07.610 --> 18:09.610]  and out of the six seeds
[18:09.610 --> 18:10.810]  that came from Daga.
[18:13.170 --> 18:14.170]  That was a gift.
[18:14.970 --> 18:17.010]  There was two that made it one male,
[18:17.010 --> 18:18.210]  one female.
[18:18.210 --> 18:19.850]  Look at this plant, man.
[18:20.850 --> 18:21.850]  It's just phenomenal.
[18:21.850 --> 18:23.650]  It smells just like
[18:23.650 --> 18:24.490]  mango cookies.
[18:24.490 --> 18:25.490]  So what did I do?
[18:27.610 --> 18:29.290]  I bred it back
[18:29.290 --> 18:30.810]  to itself, because what do you do if
[18:30.810 --> 18:32.490]  you got one male and one female from
[18:32.490 --> 18:34.330]  a pack of seeds and they both look
[18:34.330 --> 18:36.090]  pretty decent, right?
[18:36.090 --> 18:38.090]  You just breed them back to himself,
[18:38.090 --> 18:39.090]  I would guess.
[18:40.690 --> 18:41.690]  So that's what I did.
[18:43.330 --> 18:44.330]  Cool.
[18:45.130 --> 18:46.730]  But yeah, this is what's
[18:46.730 --> 18:47.730]  in there.
[18:50.010 --> 18:51.090]  Right.
[18:51.090 --> 18:52.410]  And then I just kind of
[18:54.730 --> 18:56.610]  you know, throw my males
[18:56.610 --> 18:58.490]  in the bathroom with another
[18:58.490 --> 19:00.330]  light and
[19:00.330 --> 19:02.450]  then chuck the pollen
[19:02.450 --> 19:04.850]  and keep the best females
[19:04.850 --> 19:06.410]  and then toss them.
[19:06.410 --> 19:08.530]  The you know, in the garage, I had
[19:08.530 --> 19:10.090]  like 40 different plants.
[19:10.090 --> 19:11.330]  I'm like, that's like four hundred
[19:11.330 --> 19:11.970]  dollars, right?
[19:11.970 --> 19:13.130]  Because they're like ten dollars a
[19:13.130 --> 19:14.850]  seed. I'm just like,
[19:14.850 --> 19:16.850]  I throw more weed away than most
[19:16.850 --> 19:17.850]  people.
[19:17.850 --> 19:18.850]  Ha ha.
[19:19.650 --> 19:20.650]  Yeah.
[19:21.650 --> 19:22.850]  Yeah, but.
[19:24.650 --> 19:26.250]  Yeah, this is a little project, this
[19:26.250 --> 19:28.050]  is at my dad's, you know, you guys
[19:28.050 --> 19:29.690]  saw the one at my house.
[19:29.690 --> 19:31.610]  I got one of my mom's and then
[19:31.610 --> 19:32.970]  I have the farm.
[19:32.970 --> 19:35.210]  So they're just
[19:35.210 --> 19:37.090]  been showing my parents how to grow.
[19:37.090 --> 19:38.090]  They're kind of
[19:40.090 --> 19:41.850]  just helping me sift through
[19:41.850 --> 19:43.330]  plants, really, and try to find the
[19:43.330 --> 19:44.090]  best genetics.
[19:44.090 --> 19:45.810]  I want to be that specialty guy that
[19:45.810 --> 19:46.810]  people are like.
[19:50.500 --> 19:52.580]  When they're there with it,
[19:52.580 --> 19:54.100]  they're like, OK, with it.
[19:58.740 --> 20:00.780]  Then nowhere to come get it.
[20:04.790 --> 20:05.550]  Yeah. Oh, yeah.
[20:05.550 --> 20:07.510]  They love it. They're like, you
[20:07.510 --> 20:08.790]  know, my mom's actually allergic to
[20:08.790 --> 20:10.110]  weed. She can't smoke it.
[20:10.110 --> 20:11.910]  So I'm like the first one in like
[20:11.910 --> 20:13.710]  two generations that's been able to
[20:13.710 --> 20:15.550]  smoke since my grandfather.
[20:18.570 --> 20:20.410]  But yeah, my mom, she can't touch it
[20:20.410 --> 20:22.370]  or anything, she'll break out.
[20:22.370 --> 20:23.370]  But she
[20:25.210 --> 20:26.850]  she loves growing the plant.
[20:26.850 --> 20:28.290]  My grandma loves it, too.
[20:28.290 --> 20:30.250]  She never even really seen
[20:30.250 --> 20:31.250]  it.
[20:34.920 --> 20:35.920]  That's awesome.
[20:36.760 --> 20:37.880]  Everything looks great.
[20:40.400 --> 20:42.440]  Yeah, man, those are some very
[20:42.440 --> 20:43.440]  happy plants.
[21:01.640 --> 21:03.280]  My little one of my little projects,
[21:03.280 --> 21:05.080]  I think I broke a lamp stepping back
[21:05.080 --> 21:06.080]  on one of those.
[21:08.240 --> 21:09.720]  Be careful, be careful.
[21:11.160 --> 21:12.160]  Right.
[21:12.800 --> 21:13.600]  Good thing there are only eight
[21:13.600 --> 21:14.600]  books.
[21:14.920 --> 21:16.920]  We don't need to include a live
[21:16.920 --> 21:19.120]  hospital trip in this
[21:19.120 --> 21:20.120]  session.
[21:20.680 --> 21:22.120]  It's like I'm telling you right now,
[21:22.120 --> 21:23.720]  Nick, if you like slice yourself
[21:23.720 --> 21:25.560]  up, it's just you're
[21:25.560 --> 21:26.720]  staying on.
[21:26.720 --> 21:27.720]  We don't give a fuck.
[21:28.600 --> 21:29.600]  You got you.
[21:29.800 --> 21:31.480]  You're stuck here for two hours.
[21:33.080 --> 21:34.080]  Whether you like it or not.
[21:39.350 --> 21:40.910]  See, this is some of the pollen I
[21:40.910 --> 21:41.910]  chucked.
[21:41.910 --> 21:43.550]  I I've been drying it out.
[21:49.350 --> 21:50.790]  There's drying some pollen out.
[21:59.340 --> 22:00.940]  That's fucking awesome.
[22:02.460 --> 22:04.700]  I usually just put the damn pollen
[22:04.700 --> 22:05.980]  in some fucking cotton.
[22:08.220 --> 22:10.260]  Not that that's a bad idea,
[22:10.260 --> 22:12.380]  I think that's really cool, but like.
[22:14.740 --> 22:16.620]  I just usually put it in cotton
[22:16.620 --> 22:17.620]  and save it.
[22:17.740 --> 22:19.260]  How does everyone else do it?
[22:19.660 --> 22:21.620]  I put it in cotton and save it and
[22:21.620 --> 22:23.420]  then I usually refrigerate it.
[22:25.340 --> 22:26.540]  It looks like you got a little bunch
[22:26.540 --> 22:28.300]  of coke pile around
[22:28.300 --> 22:29.300]  here.
[22:35.420 --> 22:36.540]  What do you mean shopping in your
[22:36.540 --> 22:37.540]  bathroom?
[22:40.860 --> 22:42.540]  No, my parents wouldn't be cool with
[22:42.540 --> 22:43.540]  that.
[22:43.740 --> 22:44.740]  No, I am.
[22:45.940 --> 22:46.940]  No parents.
[22:49.260 --> 22:51.140]  But yeah, I'd like to
[22:52.420 --> 22:54.220]  normally the D homes run in
[22:54.220 --> 22:56.300]  for like a day and I'll drop it down
[22:56.300 --> 22:58.660]  to like thirty five
[22:58.660 --> 23:00.540]  or forty and run it for like twenty
[23:00.540 --> 23:02.100]  four to forty eight hours
[23:02.420 --> 23:03.940]  and dry it out really good.
[23:04.940 --> 23:07.380]  And then I'll put it in like a vial.
[23:08.300 --> 23:10.140]  I just like to put it on these
[23:10.140 --> 23:12.140]  first so I can get it to
[23:12.140 --> 23:14.140]  go in the vial, you know, like
[23:14.140 --> 23:16.140]  I can fold these up and just
[23:16.140 --> 23:17.980]  kind of sift it in
[23:17.980 --> 23:20.140]  the vial. But I'll put
[23:20.140 --> 23:22.580]  rice in the vial and then
[23:22.580 --> 23:24.420]  I'll let that
[23:24.420 --> 23:26.140]  sit for like a day or two with the
[23:26.140 --> 23:28.180]  rice in the vial with the pollen
[23:28.580 --> 23:29.580]  and then
[23:30.860 --> 23:32.700]  and then I'll put it in the freezer
[23:33.180 --> 23:35.300]  and it's normally good for about six
[23:35.300 --> 23:37.100]  months. So I can,
[23:38.380 --> 23:40.820]  you know, if I find something
[23:41.820 --> 23:43.340]  within six months, I can
[23:43.980 --> 23:45.980]  just I'll put it on a Q-tip,
[23:45.980 --> 23:48.340]  just dab a Q-tip in the vial
[23:48.580 --> 23:50.620]  and I'll just roll it on the bud
[23:50.620 --> 23:52.260]  and you don't really need that much.
[23:52.980 --> 23:54.780]  You know, if you over pollinate,
[23:55.780 --> 23:56.780]  it's actually
[23:57.660 --> 23:58.660]  detrimental.
[23:59.820 --> 24:01.300]  Exactly, exactly.
[24:01.300 --> 24:03.380]  And and the other thing is, if you
[24:03.380 --> 24:04.380]  want to like
[24:06.020 --> 24:08.100]  if you keep it longer,
[24:08.940 --> 24:10.780]  if you want to keep it longer, you can
[24:10.780 --> 24:12.300]  you can just
[24:12.300 --> 24:14.180]  keep it longer. You can like actually
[24:14.180 --> 24:15.500]  do it in the fridge.
[24:15.500 --> 24:17.540]  It's it doesn't sound like it
[24:17.540 --> 24:19.860]  would work as best, but
[24:19.860 --> 24:22.140]  it does work better if you don't
[24:22.140 --> 24:23.780]  put it in the freezer because it
[24:23.780 --> 24:25.740]  actually starts to crack up
[24:25.740 --> 24:27.980]  the structure of the
[24:30.500 --> 24:31.820]  of it. But like
[24:33.100 --> 24:34.860]  basically you can just
[24:35.820 --> 24:36.980]  go and
[24:38.980 --> 24:41.140]  hold all of
[24:41.420 --> 24:42.700]  that pollen in
[24:44.500 --> 24:47.060]  vitro in a refrigerator.
[24:47.620 --> 24:49.460]  And I've done it for years.
[24:49.460 --> 24:51.500]  I've had like for multiple years
[24:51.500 --> 24:53.020]  and it was still viable.
[24:54.340 --> 24:56.700]  And so I feel
[24:56.700 --> 24:58.780]  like that's something
[24:58.780 --> 25:00.580]  a lot of people need to know is like
[25:00.580 --> 25:02.420]  you can definitely take
[25:02.420 --> 25:04.460]  pollen in the refrigerator
[25:04.900 --> 25:07.500]  and it will hold forever
[25:07.500 --> 25:09.380]  as long as you take care
[25:09.420 --> 25:11.500]  of it. You cannot let it
[25:12.820 --> 25:14.980]  fluctuate in temperature and all that.
[25:20.620 --> 25:22.340]  So I have the Ken Haramaru
[25:22.340 --> 25:24.780]  Reds cross.
[25:24.780 --> 25:26.260]  I don't know what's with my ability
[25:26.260 --> 25:28.140]  to talk today. It's atrocious.
[25:28.140 --> 25:29.300]  Apparently I can't put two words
[25:29.300 --> 25:30.220]  together.
[25:30.220 --> 25:32.020]  But anyways, I have the
[25:32.020 --> 25:34.260]  the Ken Haramaru Reds cross
[25:34.260 --> 25:35.860]  with the ice cream cakes.
[25:35.860 --> 25:38.300]  And I got like three pretty
[25:38.300 --> 25:39.780]  separate looking plants.
[25:40.900 --> 25:41.900]  So this is.
[25:43.580 --> 25:44.580]  One.
[25:47.640 --> 25:48.640]  Of them.
[25:54.180 --> 25:55.740]  Let me just switch my mic is
[25:55.740 --> 25:56.860]  I'm not coming through, actually,
[25:56.860 --> 25:58.540]  can you guys hear me nice and clean?
[25:58.540 --> 25:59.420]  Yep.
[25:59.420 --> 26:01.100]  Awesome. This is way easier than
[26:01.100 --> 26:02.700]  you just switch the headphone off.
[26:02.700 --> 26:03.780]  Boom.
[26:03.780 --> 26:05.540]  All right. So I got this three times.
[26:05.540 --> 26:07.420]  So I wanted to kind of sorry to push
[26:07.420 --> 26:08.700]  push in here a little bit, but I
[26:08.700 --> 26:10.940]  needed to get this done before
[26:10.940 --> 26:12.740]  my light time is up
[26:12.740 --> 26:13.980]  because I'm running out
[26:14.820 --> 26:15.820]  of
[26:16.620 --> 26:18.380]  time of them being able to come out.
[26:18.380 --> 26:20.220]  So these have not been in flower
[26:20.220 --> 26:21.500]  very long. You can see I've stripped
[26:21.500 --> 26:23.420]  them really hard
[26:23.420 --> 26:24.500]  to cut them for clones.
[26:24.500 --> 26:25.820]  And then I took the the mum and
[26:25.820 --> 26:28.220]  threw them in to just have some fun.
[26:28.220 --> 26:30.220]  I wanted some good fun decor
[26:30.220 --> 26:32.180]  decoration for my wedding
[26:32.180 --> 26:34.260]  that's up next week, next Saturday.
[26:34.260 --> 26:36.380]  So I really wanted to like
[26:36.380 --> 26:37.780]  have some funky shaped plants.
[26:37.780 --> 26:39.980]  And you can see they're pretty
[26:39.980 --> 26:40.980]  pretty tall.
[26:40.980 --> 26:42.740]  They're about I'd say
[26:42.740 --> 26:44.420]  about three and a half feet tall.
[26:44.420 --> 26:45.980]  And I've cleaned them up all on the
[26:45.980 --> 26:47.540]  bottom. Nothing there.
[26:49.180 --> 26:50.940]  And then I'm just there's
[26:50.940 --> 26:51.740]  what this is.
[26:51.740 --> 26:52.980]  This is the choice cut.
[26:52.980 --> 26:54.940]  I have nine number nine and
[26:54.940 --> 26:56.300]  I have a whole bunch more of them.
[26:56.300 --> 26:58.060]  And they're at this stage of the
[26:58.060 --> 27:00.380]  shorter, widest of the leaves
[27:00.380 --> 27:02.820]  of the set. And the aroma
[27:02.820 --> 27:04.740]  profile on this is
[27:04.740 --> 27:06.340]  I don't I don't even know.
[27:06.340 --> 27:08.300]  It's it's very different from what
[27:08.300 --> 27:09.220]  I'm used to growing.
[27:09.220 --> 27:10.980]  So I'm still learning to interpret
[27:10.980 --> 27:11.980]  her a little bit.
[27:13.220 --> 27:14.300]  Agreed.
[27:14.300 --> 27:15.900]  Yeah. Same here is
[27:15.900 --> 27:17.740]  a very this one's quite a bit less
[27:17.740 --> 27:19.180]  time in it, but you can see that the
[27:19.180 --> 27:22.140]  nodes are a little bit heavier
[27:22.140 --> 27:25.020]  calyx per leaf ratio.
[27:25.020 --> 27:27.180]  And you can see a nice wide leaf.
[27:28.940 --> 27:30.180]  Kind of neat on this one.
[27:30.180 --> 27:31.380]  So I think this one's going to turn
[27:31.380 --> 27:32.380]  out a little bit. So this is about
[27:32.380 --> 27:33.860]  two weeks difference in time.
[27:34.860 --> 27:36.500]  And flower.
[27:36.500 --> 27:38.340]  And then this is a complete and
[27:38.340 --> 27:39.700]  these are different phenotypes, so
[27:39.700 --> 27:40.740]  they're not all shaped the same.
[27:40.740 --> 27:42.060]  They're all very quite a bit
[27:42.060 --> 27:43.220]  different. And you can see this one's
[27:43.220 --> 27:44.340]  super stacky.
[27:44.340 --> 27:45.340]  A little bit ugly.
[27:47.060 --> 27:48.380]  Pretty nice.
[27:48.380 --> 27:53.010]  Pretty happy with them, man.
[27:53.010 --> 27:53.810]  They're really cool.
[27:53.810 --> 27:55.490]  And I got like a really fun shape to
[27:55.490 --> 27:57.290]  them, which will be nice.
[27:57.290 --> 27:58.290]  I'll be the core.
[27:58.290 --> 27:59.890]  I'll be cool. The core for my wedding.
[27:59.890 --> 28:01.570]  That's for sure. Nice showpieces.
[28:01.570 --> 28:03.770]  And then I got these guys as well,
[28:03.770 --> 28:05.410]  which have just started into flower.
[28:05.410 --> 28:07.090]  And I've done you've seen that pretty
[28:07.090 --> 28:09.170]  pretty similar heavy, heavy
[28:09.170 --> 28:10.650]  stripping. I got that really flat
[28:10.650 --> 28:11.650]  LED, but.
[28:12.570 --> 28:13.770]  Pretty cool.
[28:13.770 --> 28:14.930]  And then so I'm going to put this
[28:14.930 --> 28:15.930]  on the side.
[28:15.930 --> 28:16.930]  I'm going to put this on the side.
[28:17.050 --> 28:18.810]  And then so I'm going to load this,
[28:18.810 --> 28:20.770]  load this in really quick because
[28:20.770 --> 28:22.410]  I have to get these loaded in before
[28:22.410 --> 28:23.410]  they've been out too long.
[28:24.290 --> 28:26.210]  So I will be right back.
[28:27.290 --> 28:28.290]  And then I'll show some more.
[28:40.940 --> 28:42.580]  Those are really pretty on them.
[28:42.580 --> 28:44.540]  They really are ice cream
[28:44.540 --> 28:46.420]  cake side to
[28:46.420 --> 28:47.420]  I think.
[28:48.860 --> 28:51.340]  All them purple, he's brother,
[28:51.340 --> 28:53.340]  you know, Girl Scout cookies is like
[28:53.340 --> 28:54.340]  that.
[28:54.620 --> 28:55.820]  Do the real cut.
[28:58.660 --> 29:00.940]  And I got real nice, real
[29:01.820 --> 29:03.860]  nice rounded buds.
[29:03.860 --> 29:05.820]  I'm into the rounded, but, you
[29:05.820 --> 29:06.820]  know.
[29:20.890 --> 29:22.890]  So, Corey,
[29:24.010 --> 29:26.610]  hey, did you ever
[29:26.730 --> 29:27.730]  use?
[29:32.060 --> 29:33.300]  I'm losing you, is it me?
[29:37.350 --> 29:38.350]  Can you hear me?
[29:50.820 --> 29:51.820]  You're still there.
[29:51.860 --> 29:52.860]  I can hear you, Cole, still grown
[29:52.860 --> 29:53.860]  and Corey, everybody still there.
[29:53.860 --> 29:54.860]  We there.
[29:54.860 --> 29:55.860]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[29:55.900 --> 29:56.900]  Gotcha. All right. I thought I lost
[29:56.900 --> 29:57.900]  everybody.
[29:57.940 --> 29:59.300]  No, Nick dropped out for a second.
[29:59.300 --> 30:01.060]  Thanks. Thanks, Peter, for jumping in
[30:01.060 --> 30:02.060]  and helping out, brother.
[30:03.580 --> 30:09.110]  So, yeah, I've got
[30:09.670 --> 30:10.670]  four females.
[30:11.590 --> 30:13.590]  I've got two of the shorter.
[30:15.110 --> 30:16.630]  And not by a heck of a lot, either.
[30:16.630 --> 30:17.630]  Maybe.
[30:18.150 --> 30:19.150]  Maybe about a foot.
[30:19.790 --> 30:20.790]  They're shorter.
[30:21.470 --> 30:23.470]  I am weak.
[30:23.470 --> 30:25.190]  Let's see, I'm day 21 here now.
[30:25.710 --> 30:28.710]  And I've got.
[30:31.710 --> 30:32.710]  Flowers.
[30:34.390 --> 30:42.050]  On two tall ones.
[30:43.930 --> 30:46.850]  A little bit less on
[30:47.850 --> 30:49.050]  one of the short ones.
[30:51.450 --> 30:52.970]  And this girl here just.
[30:55.530 --> 30:57.810]  I mean, it's starting to I can't
[30:57.810 --> 30:58.810]  tell if you can see it.
[30:58.930 --> 31:01.370]  Just starting to show flower.
[31:03.290 --> 31:05.330]  She's definitely lighter and
[31:05.330 --> 31:07.650]  drawing more than the rest.
[31:10.290 --> 31:12.090]  Mr. Toad suggested
[31:12.610 --> 31:14.610]  some more red to try
[31:14.610 --> 31:15.930]  to get them to flower.
[31:17.450 --> 31:18.450]  And I think.
[31:19.370 --> 31:21.370]  If Mr. Trees were here, I could ask
[31:21.370 --> 31:23.370]  him if maybe it was Kenderhar
[31:23.370 --> 31:24.370]  or.
[31:25.370 --> 31:26.370]  I don't know.
[31:26.410 --> 31:27.410]  I don't know.
[31:27.530 --> 31:29.010]  Maybe it was Kenderhar or
[31:29.970 --> 31:31.370]  maybe closer to the equator.
[31:31.410 --> 31:33.370]  I'm not sure how that all works.
[31:33.370 --> 31:35.290]  But yeah, that's what
[31:35.290 --> 31:36.610]  I'm experiencing anyways.
[31:36.610 --> 31:38.650]  But anyhow, they're great plants.
[31:38.690 --> 31:40.770]  I mean, just beautiful,
[31:40.970 --> 31:41.970]  beautiful plants.
[31:42.690 --> 31:43.690]  Very happy with.
[31:45.410 --> 31:47.250]  Red will help with the
[31:47.250 --> 31:49.330]  flowering in terms of like
[31:49.330 --> 31:50.490]  the flower output.
[31:50.530 --> 31:52.370]  It will fucking stretch
[31:52.370 --> 31:53.450]  this shit out of the plant.
[31:53.450 --> 31:55.450]  So so you've
[31:55.450 --> 31:57.370]  got to like judge how much
[31:57.370 --> 31:59.570]  red you use on any
[31:59.570 --> 32:01.410]  given cultivar.
[32:03.650 --> 32:05.970]  So be really careful
[32:05.970 --> 32:06.730]  with that.
[32:06.730 --> 32:08.570]  But yeah, it's
[32:08.570 --> 32:09.770]  not that big of a deal.
[32:09.770 --> 32:11.330]  It's not like it's like, oh, it's
[32:11.330 --> 32:12.810]  going to get you.
[32:13.930 --> 32:15.570]  If you want to use more red than
[32:15.570 --> 32:17.490]  use more red, that's why a lot
[32:17.490 --> 32:20.050]  of us still use the HPS.
[32:20.810 --> 32:21.810]  And.
[32:22.810 --> 32:24.770]  And actually, that was one
[32:24.770 --> 32:25.930]  of the things I was talking to
[32:25.970 --> 32:27.210]  London about was
[32:28.170 --> 32:29.890]  trying to get out of out of
[32:29.890 --> 32:31.730]  doing the HBS and getting into
[32:31.730 --> 32:33.450]  the LED fucking scene.
[32:33.450 --> 32:34.730]  And I don't know if you guys want
[32:34.730 --> 32:36.250]  to talk about that today, but.
[32:37.810 --> 32:39.530]  So this is another one of
[32:39.530 --> 32:40.530]  Mr. Tree's.
[32:43.330 --> 32:45.370]  It's the.
[32:46.730 --> 32:48.570]  Cool ranch is what it is, this
[32:48.570 --> 32:49.570]  I cool.
[32:49.610 --> 32:51.410]  You got to be happy with this
[32:51.410 --> 32:53.370]  plant. This is just one single
[32:53.370 --> 32:55.090]  beast and it just
[32:55.450 --> 32:56.610]  I mean, it's not.
[32:57.570 --> 32:59.170]  Absolutely beautiful.
[33:00.610 --> 33:02.170]  Same thing, day 21.
[33:02.930 --> 33:04.930]  The smell on it's insane.
[33:06.010 --> 33:07.010]  It's just got.
[33:08.210 --> 33:10.090]  You know, it smells good,
[33:10.090 --> 33:11.850]  it smells disgusting, like Mr.
[33:11.850 --> 33:13.610]  Tree's says all the time, it kind
[33:13.610 --> 33:14.930]  of catches you in that loop where
[33:14.930 --> 33:16.970]  you just sniff it and kind of like,
[33:16.970 --> 33:17.770]  yuck.
[33:17.770 --> 33:18.770]  But wait a minute, it's kind of
[33:18.770 --> 33:20.650]  good, you know, and you go back
[33:20.650 --> 33:22.410]  to it. It's just it's definitely
[33:22.410 --> 33:23.370]  one of those plants.
[33:23.370 --> 33:25.170]  I love it. I absolutely love it.
[33:29.680 --> 33:31.800]  You are doing an incredible job
[33:31.800 --> 33:33.600]  there, man, that is like
[33:33.600 --> 33:35.600]  a lot of plant mass
[33:35.600 --> 33:37.160]  in that little space.
[33:37.160 --> 33:38.920]  Yeah, I mean, that thing just took
[33:38.920 --> 33:40.000]  off, it really did.
[33:40.000 --> 33:41.840]  And it you know, it you say what
[33:41.840 --> 33:43.800]  day did you say you were at?
[33:43.800 --> 33:44.800]  Twenty one.
[33:44.800 --> 33:46.640]  Are you going to do another strip?
[33:46.640 --> 33:47.640]  Are you going to do any sort of
[33:47.640 --> 33:48.800]  strip in between here?
[33:50.120 --> 33:52.080]  What I did was I cleaned it up
[33:52.080 --> 33:54.080]  all the way to the underside
[33:54.080 --> 33:55.080]  here.
[33:56.400 --> 33:58.480]  And I'll probably just
[33:58.480 --> 34:00.920]  what I normally do is let it go.
[34:00.920 --> 34:02.840]  And if I experience any
[34:02.840 --> 34:04.720]  kind of like real problem with
[34:04.720 --> 34:06.480]  overlap or,
[34:06.480 --> 34:08.320]  you know, if I if I come up and
[34:08.320 --> 34:09.920]  feel leaves that are wet because
[34:09.920 --> 34:11.600]  they're, you know, lap,
[34:11.600 --> 34:13.000]  then I'll just kind of pluck here
[34:13.000 --> 34:14.920]  and there and hold and tuck.
[34:14.920 --> 34:16.720]  I don't really aggressively do
[34:16.720 --> 34:19.000]  anything after this point.
[34:19.000 --> 34:20.720]  But I mean, this is one plant that
[34:20.720 --> 34:22.440]  I put in and it was
[34:22.440 --> 34:23.320]  a good size plant.
[34:23.320 --> 34:25.000]  Don't get me wrong.
[34:25.040 --> 34:26.960]  But I put this in probably 10
[34:26.960 --> 34:28.760]  days before I flipped.
[34:28.760 --> 34:30.760]  And then I you know, I bet these
[34:30.760 --> 34:33.320]  it was four in this section,
[34:33.320 --> 34:34.440]  different cultivar.
[34:34.440 --> 34:36.000]  But, you know, I mean.
[34:39.480 --> 34:41.680]  Yeah, it's
[34:41.680 --> 34:43.560]  yeah, it's a beast, it's a beast.
[34:44.920 --> 34:46.760]  And the color, the shit, your leaf
[34:46.760 --> 34:48.920]  shape, the like,
[34:48.920 --> 34:50.800]  they're just really fucking happy
[34:50.800 --> 34:51.560]  plants.
[34:51.560 --> 34:52.680]  Yeah, I mean, and
[34:54.000 --> 34:55.840]  it's not like I'm going
[34:55.840 --> 34:58.200]  nuts doing anything crazy, just,
[34:58.200 --> 34:59.200]  you know,
[34:59.880 --> 35:02.000]  I make compost tea with
[35:02.000 --> 35:03.800]  worm castings and
[35:03.800 --> 35:05.280]  I use a little fish shit here and
[35:05.280 --> 35:06.280]  there and.
[35:10.920 --> 35:11.920]  Humix.
[35:13.920 --> 35:14.920]  I don't have my hand.
[35:15.880 --> 35:17.760]  I got a whole humix,
[35:17.760 --> 35:19.240]  one of them, but, you know, and
[35:19.240 --> 35:20.240]  it's.
[35:20.560 --> 35:22.680]  I've used it twice
[35:22.680 --> 35:23.680]  in veg.
[35:24.800 --> 35:27.160]  I guess once in veg, once
[35:27.160 --> 35:28.400]  at transition and.
[35:29.240 --> 35:31.480]  You know, I'll probably
[35:31.480 --> 35:32.480]  do it one more time.
[35:34.640 --> 35:35.920]  Watering cycle.
[35:38.120 --> 35:40.080]  I guess I don't really
[35:40.080 --> 35:42.480]  have I kind of just use a
[35:42.480 --> 35:45.040]  like an outside garden one
[35:45.040 --> 35:46.920]  that, you know, I'll kind of just
[35:46.920 --> 35:49.040]  come along and spray
[35:49.040 --> 35:50.040]  down.
[35:50.600 --> 35:52.600]  You know, spray down underneath and
[35:52.600 --> 35:54.400]  get the mulch
[35:54.400 --> 35:55.400]  moist
[35:56.320 --> 35:57.440]  as far as the pots go.
[35:57.440 --> 35:58.480]  I'll do the same thing.
[35:58.480 --> 35:59.720]  And then I kind of just lift them
[35:59.720 --> 36:01.280]  and I let them I let them get
[36:01.280 --> 36:03.000]  pretty dry. I mean, not
[36:03.000 --> 36:04.800]  dry as a bone, but pretty
[36:04.800 --> 36:06.280]  dry. You know, I let them dry out
[36:06.280 --> 36:07.280]  pretty good.
[36:08.400 --> 36:10.120]  But I like to keep I like to keep
[36:10.120 --> 36:11.120]  the mulch moist.
[36:11.800 --> 36:13.200]  I like to make sure that there's a
[36:13.200 --> 36:15.040]  good moist layer
[36:15.040 --> 36:16.560]  on top. You stick your fingers in
[36:16.560 --> 36:18.200]  and it might feel a little bit
[36:18.200 --> 36:20.160]  dry. But as long as the mulch
[36:20.160 --> 36:21.920]  is moist, I think it's
[36:21.920 --> 36:23.360]  I think it's all right.
[36:23.360 --> 36:24.800]  In my opinion, it's worked all right
[36:24.800 --> 36:25.800]  so far.
[36:26.440 --> 36:28.000]  I don't think there's anything
[36:28.000 --> 36:29.120]  wrong there.
[36:29.120 --> 36:30.600]  I don't think anybody can complain
[36:30.600 --> 36:32.480]  about anything in that space.
[36:32.480 --> 36:33.920]  It's all like so beautiful.
[36:35.160 --> 36:36.160]  Thank you.
[36:40.480 --> 36:41.600]  Oh, no. Hi.
[36:45.040 --> 36:46.600]  Gordy, your camera cut.
[36:47.160 --> 36:48.160]  Are you moving back?
[36:49.160 --> 36:50.320]  I was switching it back to the
[36:50.320 --> 36:51.320]  other side.
[36:51.320 --> 36:52.960]  OK, OK, OK, OK.
[36:53.520 --> 36:55.000]  I don't have much more to show you.
[37:01.240 --> 37:02.320]  I've got some boys of the
[37:02.320 --> 37:03.880]  Ken to Harmour Roof Red that I can
[37:03.880 --> 37:04.640]  show as well.
[37:04.640 --> 37:05.840]  If I switch cameras over.
[37:07.640 --> 37:11.730]  Some of the males were nice.
[37:13.530 --> 37:14.530]  Hey, Corey,
[37:15.090 --> 37:16.530]  I could you could you would you
[37:16.530 --> 37:17.650]  mind showing that again?
[37:17.650 --> 37:19.250]  I was trying to show my dad, but I
[37:19.250 --> 37:21.050]  kept falling in and
[37:21.050 --> 37:22.050]  out on the tent.
[37:24.530 --> 37:25.530]  What do you want to see?
[37:25.810 --> 37:26.810]  All of it. Some of it.
[37:26.810 --> 37:28.290]  Show them your tent like,
[37:29.130 --> 37:30.130]  you know.
[37:30.730 --> 37:31.890]  I've been teaching them how to
[37:32.890 --> 37:34.650]  grow and it'd be nice just
[37:34.970 --> 37:36.730]  for him to see somebody else grow,
[37:36.890 --> 37:37.890]  you know, and.
[37:38.170 --> 37:40.250]  And dude, that guy, Corey,
[37:40.250 --> 37:42.090]  you got like the cleanest, tightest
[37:42.090 --> 37:43.850]  grow I've I've seen.
[37:43.850 --> 37:45.530]  Yeah, I get to see I get to see
[37:45.530 --> 37:47.210]  grows big and small all
[37:47.210 --> 37:48.610]  over the place. This is fucking
[37:48.610 --> 37:49.850]  really nice and tight.
[37:49.850 --> 37:51.530]  And I think it's very
[37:51.530 --> 37:52.530]  awesome.
[37:52.650 --> 37:53.650]  Looks great.
[37:54.250 --> 37:55.810]  So what I normally do is
[37:56.130 --> 37:57.690]  recently I've had two
[37:58.210 --> 38:00.810]  four by four beds and
[38:01.890 --> 38:03.370]  I'll keep those scrugged with
[38:03.370 --> 38:04.650]  plants that I'm familiar with.
[38:06.290 --> 38:08.130]  And then anything that's new, like
[38:08.130 --> 38:09.410]  the Mr. Trees that I haven't seen
[38:09.410 --> 38:11.090]  before, I run them in pots that way
[38:11.090 --> 38:13.050]  if there's an issue or a problem
[38:13.050 --> 38:14.890]  or if anything pops
[38:14.890 --> 38:16.490]  up, I can yank them, you know, so
[38:16.490 --> 38:18.010]  they're not kind of stuck in my.
[38:18.890 --> 38:20.810]  In my scrug and, you
[38:20.810 --> 38:21.970]  know, tied up
[38:23.570 --> 38:25.210]  and in this one, I kind of did the
[38:25.210 --> 38:26.690]  same thing, but just laid it out
[38:26.850 --> 38:27.850]  different.
[38:29.090 --> 38:30.690]  But yeah, I get the two four by
[38:30.690 --> 38:31.690]  four beds.
[38:32.570 --> 38:34.170]  And then I leave an area where I
[38:34.450 --> 38:36.530]  can just run loose plants.
[38:44.090 --> 38:46.210]  But I mean, you know, I see you have
[38:46.210 --> 38:47.850]  like your own space over there, and
[38:47.850 --> 38:49.490]  that's nice, too, because you're not
[38:49.490 --> 38:50.610]  married to attend.
[38:50.650 --> 38:52.170]  You've got a nice big, full room.
[38:53.090 --> 38:54.770]  You know, and you can do these beds
[38:54.770 --> 38:56.730]  if you are interested in doing
[38:56.730 --> 38:59.050]  them in a room, same setup
[38:59.050 --> 39:00.770]  and build the scrug and you know,
[39:01.330 --> 39:02.690]  you don't have to be stuck in a tent
[39:02.690 --> 39:03.690]  doing it either.
[39:04.770 --> 39:06.170]  There's a lot of
[39:06.290 --> 39:08.810]  there's a lot of advantage
[39:09.410 --> 39:10.490]  being in a tent with the
[39:10.490 --> 39:12.370]  reflectivity of the walls and
[39:13.170 --> 39:14.530]  the LEDs.
[39:15.170 --> 39:16.850]  When you have ones that go edge to
[39:16.850 --> 39:18.090]  edge like that can be really
[39:18.090 --> 39:19.090]  helpful.
[39:19.250 --> 39:20.450]  The main thing being is that you
[39:20.450 --> 39:22.050]  just get that direct up and down
[39:22.050 --> 39:24.010]  heat light and that
[39:24.010 --> 39:25.890]  reflectivity will really
[39:26.010 --> 39:28.010]  make your canopy a little
[39:28.010 --> 39:29.490]  bit more even on the edges
[39:29.890 --> 39:30.970]  where you don't get the other thing.
[39:30.970 --> 39:32.170]  Why am I on full image?
[39:32.170 --> 39:33.170]  Oh, yeah, Corey.
[39:33.930 --> 39:35.290]  Because I because I dipped out
[39:35.330 --> 39:36.330]  again.
[39:39.000 --> 39:40.000]  And here, let me.
[39:43.040 --> 39:44.040]  There we go. Thank you.
[39:44.120 --> 39:45.120]  Can you guys hear me? All right.
[39:45.840 --> 39:46.840]  Yep.
[39:47.760 --> 39:49.600]  OK, so I'll go back and I'm going
[39:49.600 --> 39:51.600]  to have to I'll probably glitch in
[39:51.600 --> 39:52.600]  and out here for.
[40:08.050 --> 40:08.810]  Back.
[40:08.810 --> 40:09.810]  Nick, you're muted.
[40:09.930 --> 40:10.930]  Now you're back.
[40:11.290 --> 40:12.290]  There we go.
[40:13.330 --> 40:14.330]  You guys see me? All right.
[40:14.410 --> 40:15.410]  Just speaking.
[40:21.950 --> 40:23.710]  All right. My dog shit shovel.
[40:24.550 --> 40:26.350]  So, I mean, I don't
[40:26.350 --> 40:28.310]  know. I don't often show this back
[40:28.310 --> 40:29.310]  and that's all.
[40:30.230 --> 40:31.630]  Yeah, thanks. So this is like all
[40:31.630 --> 40:33.430]  vegetable. I don't put anything
[40:33.710 --> 40:35.230]  other than dead plants
[40:35.790 --> 40:36.790]  and hay in these
[40:37.750 --> 40:38.750]  things.
[40:39.350 --> 40:41.190]  I got some tomato wall there and
[40:41.190 --> 40:43.590]  some vegetables, stevia, tobacco.
[40:44.270 --> 40:45.350]  I'll show that I'll show the front
[40:45.350 --> 40:46.510]  of my garden to it because I got
[40:46.510 --> 40:47.590]  some cool tomatoes that you'll
[40:47.590 --> 40:48.590]  really like.
[40:49.470 --> 40:51.470]  This is one of the males
[40:51.470 --> 40:53.070]  from the Kendama roof red.
[40:54.030 --> 40:55.550]  And it's a two gallon pot.
[40:55.670 --> 40:57.350]  Again, this will be a decoration
[40:57.350 --> 40:58.350]  for the.
[40:59.270 --> 41:00.270]  For the.
[41:02.470 --> 41:03.750]  Wedding as well, which is pretty
[41:03.750 --> 41:04.870]  cool. It's about up to my.
[41:04.910 --> 41:06.590]  Let's see. I can I can switch around
[41:06.590 --> 41:07.910]  the camera real quick here.
[41:08.510 --> 41:09.790]  Settings camera.
[41:11.350 --> 41:12.350]  Let's go.
[41:16.460 --> 41:18.060]  And see if I actually show.
[41:18.100 --> 41:19.500]  So you can see it's like it's pretty
[41:19.500 --> 41:20.500]  tall.
[41:21.340 --> 41:22.340]  It's not huge.
[41:22.580 --> 41:23.580]  It's pretty tall.
[41:23.740 --> 41:24.740]  It's huge.
[41:24.860 --> 41:26.420]  Yeah. I mean, I have to water it
[41:26.740 --> 41:27.780]  like all the time.
[41:27.780 --> 41:28.780]  It's kind of a.
[41:29.900 --> 41:31.740]  But yeah, I mean,
[41:31.980 --> 41:32.980]  you make it work.
[41:33.980 --> 41:35.860]  So it'll what I'll probably
[41:35.980 --> 41:36.820]  like these are done.
[41:36.820 --> 41:37.820]  I'm getting rid of this.
[41:38.460 --> 41:39.860]  I might let one of them stick
[41:40.060 --> 41:41.580]  around and I'm just going to let
[41:41.820 --> 41:43.140]  everything kind of get pollinated
[41:43.140 --> 41:44.140]  in this area.
[41:44.180 --> 41:45.100]  You can see this one.
[41:45.100 --> 41:46.420]  This one I gave a huge strip.
[41:46.660 --> 41:47.820]  And this is literally like a
[41:47.820 --> 41:49.180]  perfect example of what I do.
[41:49.820 --> 41:51.900]  I just throw green stuff
[41:52.420 --> 41:54.100]  into there and then I throw some
[41:54.100 --> 41:55.100]  hay on top.
[41:55.220 --> 41:56.740]  And that's all I've done to this
[41:56.740 --> 41:57.860]  bed, too. And you can see how
[41:57.860 --> 41:59.020]  healthy this fucking
[41:59.900 --> 42:00.900]  beautiful plant is.
[42:03.060 --> 42:04.060]  Frank.
[42:06.100 --> 42:07.300]  That's a weak point.
[42:07.860 --> 42:09.500]  Yeah. Look at the leaves.
[42:10.340 --> 42:11.340]  I'm just big.
[42:12.140 --> 42:13.720]  Beautiful. I gave it a really hard
[42:13.720 --> 42:15.380]  strip because I'm in Canada.
[42:15.420 --> 42:16.980]  So I just want to make sure that
[42:16.980 --> 42:17.980]  she's.
[42:24.200 --> 42:25.200]  That was awesome.
[42:26.000 --> 42:27.000]  Very killer.
[42:28.000 --> 42:29.200]  Pretty killer, man.
[42:30.360 --> 42:31.560]  Yeah, this is my Akopoko
[42:32.160 --> 42:33.520]  gold from Barney Farm that I have
[42:33.520 --> 42:35.280]  for like two and a half years.
[42:36.000 --> 42:37.000]  Yeah.
[42:37.160 --> 42:38.880]  You found you found a good one.
[42:38.920 --> 42:40.680]  I went through some of Barney
[42:40.680 --> 42:41.880]  Farm stuff and
[42:42.760 --> 42:43.760]  some of it's good.
[42:43.760 --> 42:44.760]  Mostly crap.
[42:45.280 --> 42:46.320]  Some of it's crap.
[42:46.720 --> 42:48.360]  Yeah. But this was this was
[42:48.360 --> 42:49.760]  beautiful. It's a really great
[42:49.760 --> 42:50.920]  smoke, too. I have a bunch of
[42:50.920 --> 42:51.920]  flower in.
[42:52.560 --> 42:53.920]  If you stress it right, you can
[42:53.920 --> 42:55.520]  get some faciation, which is kind
[42:55.520 --> 42:56.880]  of neat, but they always mold out.
[42:57.520 --> 42:58.840]  This was remember I was telling you
[42:58.840 --> 43:00.080]  about that revenge ugly
[43:00.080 --> 43:01.080]  motherfucker.
[43:01.280 --> 43:02.840]  But this one, I think it's
[43:02.840 --> 43:03.640]  not.
[43:03.640 --> 43:04.640]  Isn't it just ugly?
[43:04.680 --> 43:06.320]  So I put this out like February and
[43:06.320 --> 43:07.320]  it survived.
[43:08.840 --> 43:10.080]  And you can see it's like it's
[43:10.080 --> 43:11.960]  almost back to health or some like
[43:11.960 --> 43:13.360]  that's almost normal growth.
[43:13.960 --> 43:15.800]  But it's just demented.
[43:16.720 --> 43:17.920]  How does it flower?
[43:18.920 --> 43:19.920]  Oh, berries and gas
[43:21.000 --> 43:22.560]  is beautiful. I got eight plants
[43:22.560 --> 43:24.000]  that is coming out and flower
[43:24.360 --> 43:25.480]  very, very soon.
[43:26.280 --> 43:28.040]  But I really like to stress test
[43:28.040 --> 43:29.040]  them and see what happens.
[43:29.040 --> 43:30.920]  So like I put these in and there
[43:30.920 --> 43:32.600]  was three, three of these separate
[43:32.600 --> 43:34.120]  plants. I actually have two others
[43:34.120 --> 43:35.840]  that are in that have
[43:35.840 --> 43:38.240]  been that were cleaned up heavier
[43:38.440 --> 43:41.000]  and and re vegetated
[43:41.040 --> 43:42.040]  a little bit quicker.
[43:42.360 --> 43:43.960]  And by doing that, I was able to
[43:43.960 --> 43:45.200]  like this one I just left out in the
[43:45.200 --> 43:46.000]  corner like this.
[43:46.000 --> 43:47.280]  The other ones I brought into a
[43:47.280 --> 43:48.360]  closer place where there was some
[43:48.360 --> 43:50.200]  light. So they didn't quite as
[43:50.320 --> 43:51.960]  as flower and revenge out as
[43:51.960 --> 43:53.160]  these because these were in February
[43:53.160 --> 43:54.800]  in Canada. So they got fucked.
[43:55.560 --> 43:56.760]  But they're doing like the thing is
[43:56.760 --> 43:58.560]  I want to see. Am I getting like do
[43:58.560 --> 44:00.240]  I have mold in
[44:00.240 --> 44:01.000]  my stem?
[44:01.000 --> 44:02.680]  Are they still like really strong
[44:02.680 --> 44:04.040]  and sturdy? How big is this?
[44:04.440 --> 44:05.600]  Look at this. Like, look at this
[44:05.600 --> 44:07.720]  guy. Like, I is fucking
[44:07.720 --> 44:08.960]  good. That's nice.
[44:08.960 --> 44:10.920]  That's a pretty
[44:11.600 --> 44:12.840]  pretty thick and heavy,
[44:13.640 --> 44:14.880]  heavy stem as well.
[44:14.880 --> 44:16.480]  And these are these are all Ryan
[44:16.480 --> 44:18.240]  Lee's genetics, too, which
[44:18.240 --> 44:19.080]  is kind of neat.
[44:19.080 --> 44:20.880]  So I've been soaring, cutting out
[44:20.880 --> 44:22.800]  some of the living in a fucking
[44:22.800 --> 44:23.800]  jungle.
[44:23.920 --> 44:24.920]  I try to.
[44:25.240 --> 44:27.280]  I have a possibly fit
[44:27.280 --> 44:28.280]  into the space.
[44:28.280 --> 44:30.040]  So but here's an example of what I
[44:30.040 --> 44:32.160]  mean. I don't do anything.
[44:32.160 --> 44:33.600]  So we took up a bunch of
[44:34.560 --> 44:36.720]  flowering cilantro
[44:36.720 --> 44:38.320]  and mixed cover crop from one of
[44:38.320 --> 44:40.200]  our other beds and we just
[44:40.200 --> 44:41.520]  take it and lay it down.
[44:42.520 --> 44:43.960]  And then I'll put another layer of
[44:43.960 --> 44:45.920]  hay in a couple of days after
[44:45.920 --> 44:47.680]  it like falls down a little bit.
[44:47.680 --> 44:49.520]  And I mean, I've got not weed that
[44:49.520 --> 44:51.600]  I have to, you know, prevent
[44:51.600 --> 44:53.120]  from getting into the other plants.
[44:53.120 --> 44:54.720]  But they really do
[44:55.080 --> 44:56.880]  barrel down and bring in a bunch of
[44:57.440 --> 44:58.560]  good stuff to the soil.
[44:58.560 --> 45:00.080]  I mean, look, there's a lot of it.
[45:00.080 --> 45:02.280]  But as long as you control
[45:02.280 --> 45:04.240]  it and kind of put a lot of life on
[45:04.240 --> 45:06.200]  top, you can fight it back.
[45:06.200 --> 45:07.640]  But then you don't have to feed.
[45:07.640 --> 45:08.760]  Right. You don't give it anything.
[45:08.760 --> 45:10.240]  These are a little bit hungrier
[45:10.240 --> 45:12.240]  because I had like another
[45:12.240 --> 45:13.480]  dozen more here.
[45:14.360 --> 45:16.320]  And you can see this is just like,
[45:16.520 --> 45:17.800]  I don't know if you guys can see
[45:17.800 --> 45:19.680]  how's the light, but there is just.
[45:24.360 --> 45:25.160]  A ton of
[45:26.000 --> 45:27.480]  time, a little bit of fungus
[45:27.480 --> 45:28.480]  gnats in there.
[45:29.080 --> 45:30.520]  If I went around, I'd probably find
[45:30.520 --> 45:31.520]  some worm.
[45:32.960 --> 45:34.640]  Very quickly, this one isn't as
[45:34.640 --> 45:36.320]  happy as some of my other beds, so
[45:36.320 --> 45:37.760]  I'd look a bit. There's lots of
[45:38.240 --> 45:39.240]  ants and.
[45:41.840 --> 45:43.360]  Good mold and some bad mold.
[45:46.910 --> 45:48.590]  But yeah, this isn't
[45:48.590 --> 45:50.190]  this isn't the primest bed, it's the
[45:50.190 --> 45:51.590]  youngest one of the whole group.
[45:51.990 --> 45:53.310]  This this area is going to get
[45:53.310 --> 45:54.550]  turned into a bed soon.
[45:57.270 --> 45:58.270]  This is pretty neat.
[45:59.070 --> 46:00.230]  That's looking awesome.
[46:01.350 --> 46:02.230]  But these are all right.
[46:02.230 --> 46:03.310]  I've been seeing the cover crop.
[46:04.150 --> 46:05.550]  Thanks. It's fun.
[46:05.550 --> 46:06.430]  I like the hay.
[46:06.430 --> 46:08.350]  Like sometimes the hay eventually
[46:08.350 --> 46:10.070]  starts fighting back the cover crop
[46:10.070 --> 46:12.230]  pretty bad because I throw seed
[46:12.230 --> 46:13.790]  down pretty regularly, but it's
[46:13.790 --> 46:14.950]  pretty selective.
[46:15.390 --> 46:17.150]  Yep. And you can see some stuff
[46:17.150 --> 46:18.150]  that has.
[46:18.990 --> 46:20.790]  That has chosen to come up some
[46:20.790 --> 46:22.750]  lettuces, some
[46:22.750 --> 46:24.070]  onions, some tomatoes.
[46:24.070 --> 46:25.070]  This is all cover.
[46:27.150 --> 46:28.150]  It's strong.
[46:28.670 --> 46:30.190]  They're kind of some cool tomatoes
[46:30.190 --> 46:32.150]  there. And this is a lupine.
[46:32.190 --> 46:33.670]  That's a really fun, cool plant.
[46:33.830 --> 46:35.310]  I always suggest somebody to grow
[46:35.310 --> 46:36.230]  lupine.
[46:36.230 --> 46:37.630]  Yeah, they come back all the time
[46:37.630 --> 46:38.910]  and you get all sorts of colors.
[46:38.910 --> 46:40.190]  Like this beautiful purple.
[46:40.670 --> 46:41.670]  Yep.
[46:45.170 --> 46:46.930]  And then I got
[46:46.930 --> 46:48.290]  there's like there's this one in
[46:48.290 --> 46:50.250]  here that's just so piney.
[46:50.290 --> 46:51.330]  Like look at it. Look at the cool
[46:51.330 --> 46:52.330]  leaf shape on this one.
[46:52.410 --> 46:53.530]  It's a neat one. And these are all
[46:53.530 --> 46:55.090]  Ryan Lee. These are all you can find
[46:55.090 --> 46:57.130]  all this on Dagadoc
[46:57.130 --> 46:58.130]  Garden as well.
[46:59.250 --> 47:00.450]  This is the other male.
[47:01.770 --> 47:02.930]  Which is a little bit. And again,
[47:02.930 --> 47:04.570]  look at that fucking big old.
[47:05.570 --> 47:07.210]  Yeah. Big old sunlit with.
[47:10.610 --> 47:11.610]  Two gallon.
[47:12.850 --> 47:14.010]  They like being in the ground.
[47:15.130 --> 47:16.130]  They do.
[47:17.090 --> 47:18.610]  They like it a lot more, but I only
[47:18.610 --> 47:19.890]  have so many places that I want to
[47:19.890 --> 47:21.850]  be able to move these props a little
[47:21.850 --> 47:23.930]  bit. So that's kind of that
[47:23.930 --> 47:25.170]  idea. Look at that. That's super
[47:25.170 --> 47:26.170]  healthy. Look at the.
[47:29.650 --> 47:30.570]  Not bad, right?
[47:31.570 --> 47:32.570]  Looks nice.
[47:33.210 --> 47:34.690]  There was a lot more plants in here.
[47:34.690 --> 47:36.250]  I selected out a bunch of dudes
[47:36.810 --> 47:38.370]  and trying to narrow it down to ones
[47:38.370 --> 47:40.130]  that even are nice and that are
[47:40.130 --> 47:41.370]  stronger than the others.
[47:41.370 --> 47:42.570]  I'll try and weed them out.
[47:43.850 --> 47:45.250]  We'll see. And then let pollen just
[47:45.250 --> 47:47.050]  fly and let things happen.
[47:48.650 --> 47:49.650]  And tomato there.
[47:50.210 --> 47:52.010]  And then here this is this is the
[47:52.370 --> 47:53.690]  so this is the greenhouse that's
[47:53.690 --> 47:54.770]  greenhouse in all the year.
[47:54.770 --> 47:55.610]  We've had some rain.
[47:55.610 --> 47:56.650]  So I've had a little bit of tarp
[47:56.650 --> 47:57.490]  pulled up.
[47:57.490 --> 47:59.170]  Damn, I've never seen it from this
[47:59.170 --> 48:00.170]  angle.
[48:00.850 --> 48:02.010]  It's kind of cool, right?
[48:03.610 --> 48:05.610]  So that's that's that's a
[48:05.850 --> 48:07.850]  two year old broccoli that
[48:08.090 --> 48:09.690]  a year and a half old broccoli.
[48:09.730 --> 48:11.370]  It's like it's just like you need
[48:11.610 --> 48:13.410]  some purple broccoli spran.
[48:13.410 --> 48:15.210]  So it's getting too much like
[48:15.210 --> 48:17.010]  I'm pretty sure this
[48:17.010 --> 48:19.210]  is this is a two year rhubarb.
[48:19.650 --> 48:21.170]  My wife just thinned it out pretty
[48:21.170 --> 48:22.610]  heavily. But you can see it's coming
[48:22.610 --> 48:24.650]  back and it's been
[48:24.650 --> 48:26.610]  covered in crazy
[48:26.610 --> 48:28.530]  mice like so we might see one or two
[48:29.490 --> 48:30.490]  coming through.
[48:31.290 --> 48:32.970]  But you can see new ones coming up.
[48:33.010 --> 48:34.410]  This is all cauliflower.
[48:34.450 --> 48:36.210]  I have some bean here.
[48:36.890 --> 48:38.730]  Some have jalapeno.
[48:38.770 --> 48:40.330]  This is all pepper, too.
[48:40.570 --> 48:42.130]  I don't spray anything other than
[48:42.130 --> 48:43.450]  labs and fulvic.
[48:44.050 --> 48:45.050]  So I don't.
[48:46.570 --> 48:48.090]  So it's like, you know, things
[48:48.090 --> 48:49.490]  there's bites and there's roly
[48:49.490 --> 48:51.570]  polies eating stuff and
[48:51.570 --> 48:52.850]  things. There's lots of
[48:53.650 --> 48:55.450]  trouble. This is one big tobacco
[48:55.450 --> 48:56.690]  plant, but this is not even the
[48:56.690 --> 48:57.690]  biggest one.
[48:57.890 --> 48:58.890]  Look at these beautiful flowers.
[48:58.890 --> 48:59.890]  They smell strongly.
[48:59.930 --> 49:00.930]  Now, it's pretty cool.
[49:02.530 --> 49:03.810]  I didn't realize how pretty the
[49:03.810 --> 49:05.050]  flowers were on those.
[49:05.050 --> 49:06.490]  Chetabob's got some beautiful
[49:06.490 --> 49:07.490]  flowers like those.
[49:07.490 --> 49:08.850]  I didn't realize that that was a
[49:08.850 --> 49:09.930]  thing on tobacco.
[49:10.810 --> 49:12.530]  Well, this is a tobacco jasmine
[49:12.530 --> 49:13.850]  cross. So I don't know.
[49:13.850 --> 49:15.490]  I've never flowered out regular
[49:15.490 --> 49:16.930]  tobacco and I don't know what it
[49:16.930 --> 49:19.050]  was. It's got similar flowers.
[49:19.210 --> 49:20.210]  Very simple.
[49:20.610 --> 49:22.490]  They smell so brilliant in the
[49:22.490 --> 49:23.890]  evening. It's pretty crazy.
[49:24.370 --> 49:25.890]  And then I got lavender here
[49:26.250 --> 49:27.530]  and my wife picks through this
[49:27.530 --> 49:28.570]  about twice a day.
[49:29.290 --> 49:30.850]  This is a big old cauliflower.
[49:30.890 --> 49:32.370]  And this is one of the
[49:32.690 --> 49:34.610]  three varieties of tomato plants
[49:34.610 --> 49:35.610]  I have.
[49:35.930 --> 49:37.330]  Boom. And you can see.
[49:39.330 --> 49:40.810]  They're faciated.
[49:41.850 --> 49:42.850]  Really cool kind of.
[49:43.970 --> 49:45.210]  Shapes, this is a neat one.
[49:45.210 --> 49:46.850]  This is a small house and that's
[49:46.850 --> 49:48.690]  one big tobacco plant from
[49:48.690 --> 49:50.330]  here all the way over is one big
[49:50.330 --> 49:51.330]  one.
[49:51.730 --> 49:53.410]  And then you just say it's
[49:53.410 --> 49:54.410]  frost.
[49:55.930 --> 49:57.770]  It's some sort. I don't cross it.
[49:57.770 --> 49:58.530]  I don't know.
[49:58.530 --> 50:00.410]  Tobacco and jasmine
[50:00.410 --> 50:01.530]  at the same time.
[50:01.850 --> 50:03.690]  There's a lot going on in this.
[50:04.050 --> 50:05.970]  I don't know exactly
[50:05.970 --> 50:07.130]  what the cross is. Don't quote me
[50:07.130 --> 50:08.130]  on it. Exactly.
[50:08.610 --> 50:09.610]  You just.
[50:10.530 --> 50:11.530]  Remove
[50:12.090 --> 50:13.090]  stream.
[50:13.370 --> 50:15.170]  You need to see my fat
[50:15.170 --> 50:17.290]  ass. This is the Shinsu bean
[50:17.290 --> 50:18.450]  I got from
[50:18.850 --> 50:20.650]  and I have no idea what's going on
[50:20.650 --> 50:22.210]  here, what's going to happen with
[50:22.210 --> 50:23.890]  this plant. But the Shinsu bean was
[50:23.890 --> 50:25.330]  given for me to me to Dragon
[50:25.330 --> 50:26.490]  Fire's medicine. The bean was like
[50:26.490 --> 50:27.930]  huge, like that big.
[50:27.930 --> 50:29.290]  It was like absolutely massive.
[50:29.610 --> 50:31.450]  I put it in a plant and now
[50:31.450 --> 50:32.650]  it's just like it's going
[50:33.250 --> 50:34.250]  all the way up.
[50:34.930 --> 50:36.650]  But this is the one tobacco plant.
[50:36.650 --> 50:37.890]  You can kind of see where the base
[50:37.890 --> 50:39.610]  is. And look at the size of some
[50:39.610 --> 50:40.610]  of these leaves.
[50:41.570 --> 50:43.010]  What a cool vibe you got in your
[50:43.010 --> 50:44.010]  yard, man.
[50:44.370 --> 50:46.170]  And in some weed
[50:46.490 --> 50:47.490]  is some.
[50:48.410 --> 50:49.250]  There's some cannabis.
[50:49.250 --> 50:51.170]  This is a aqua poco gold
[50:51.170 --> 50:53.410]  land raise cross with lemon
[50:53.810 --> 50:55.610]  cush headband that I
[50:55.610 --> 50:57.690]  accidentally threw in here and
[50:57.690 --> 50:59.650]  I got some volunteers that came
[50:59.650 --> 51:00.450]  up.
[51:00.450 --> 51:01.850]  There's sweet pea in the back.
[51:01.850 --> 51:02.970]  So my wife use those for
[51:02.970 --> 51:03.810]  aromatics.
[51:03.810 --> 51:05.450]  There's some lavender tea,
[51:05.970 --> 51:07.570]  thyme, bergamot
[51:08.410 --> 51:09.730]  and that's asparagus.
[51:11.170 --> 51:13.650]  And then some more tomato
[51:14.290 --> 51:15.290]  dianthus.
[51:15.490 --> 51:17.210]  Oh, here's a really pretty flower.
[51:18.210 --> 51:19.210]  This is dianthus.
[51:19.530 --> 51:20.450]  It's called sweetness.
[51:20.450 --> 51:22.130]  It smells really, really floral and
[51:22.130 --> 51:22.930]  nice.
[51:23.010 --> 51:24.010]  Is that a wildflower?
[51:24.970 --> 51:26.690]  No, no, no.
[51:27.010 --> 51:28.250]  Here, Elysium. That's a pretty
[51:28.250 --> 51:29.650]  common wildflower, though.
[51:30.530 --> 51:31.770]  There's Elysium. That's that's
[51:31.770 --> 51:33.050]  common. This is not so common as
[51:33.050 --> 51:34.090]  well. For a little of my lemon
[51:34.090 --> 51:35.290]  cush headband. Number one.
[51:36.450 --> 51:37.450]  David Fino.
[51:39.810 --> 51:41.010]  There's a tomato. It's ready to
[51:41.010 --> 51:42.010]  let go.
[51:42.490 --> 51:43.570]  I'll probably pull that off
[51:43.570 --> 51:44.570]  tomorrow morning.
[51:44.810 --> 51:45.810]  We're variety.
[51:46.730 --> 51:47.730]  That is
[51:49.330 --> 51:50.330]  brown cremin.
[51:51.210 --> 51:52.330]  Cremin. Oh, yeah.
[51:52.530 --> 51:53.690]  I almost got those.
[51:54.170 --> 51:55.170]  This really nice.
[51:55.330 --> 51:57.570]  This is these are
[51:57.570 --> 51:59.370]  an old heirloom variety
[51:59.370 --> 52:00.370]  of let's get that vine
[52:01.330 --> 52:03.530]  up here. An old heirloom variety
[52:03.530 --> 52:05.330]  of melon. And I have two pots that
[52:05.330 --> 52:06.330]  are growing out here.
[52:06.330 --> 52:08.050]  And then this one comes up and then
[52:08.050 --> 52:09.050]  this is a cool.
[52:10.730 --> 52:12.610]  This is a cool, cool,
[52:12.610 --> 52:13.610]  cool, cool.
[52:15.410 --> 52:17.170]  Oh, and then
[52:17.170 --> 52:18.130]  you go all the way up. Look at the
[52:18.130 --> 52:19.130]  face. He did.
[52:20.730 --> 52:21.730]  I mean, look at that.
[52:21.770 --> 52:22.930]  Isn't that fucking awesome?
[52:23.810 --> 52:24.610]  So cool.
[52:24.610 --> 52:26.090]  I like how they when they grow
[52:26.090 --> 52:27.210]  together like that.
[52:27.730 --> 52:28.610]  Oh, come on.
[52:28.610 --> 52:29.490]  That's not normal.
[52:29.490 --> 52:30.650]  They're supposed to be round and
[52:30.650 --> 52:31.650]  orange.
[52:31.730 --> 52:32.730]  Yeah.
[52:33.050 --> 52:34.050]  Oh, my.
[52:34.930 --> 52:36.570]  It's got a bruise and they won't
[52:36.570 --> 52:37.570]  buy it.
[52:38.250 --> 52:39.570]  They kind of there's some really
[52:39.570 --> 52:40.570]  funky.
[52:40.770 --> 52:41.770]  That's cool.
[52:42.490 --> 52:43.850]  And there's supposed to be a
[52:43.850 --> 52:45.130]  sticker on it, too.
[52:45.970 --> 52:47.490]  It's about it's like what?
[52:48.250 --> 52:49.370]  Six, seven feet.
[52:50.370 --> 52:51.210]  Right there.
[52:51.210 --> 52:52.530]  And I'm going to have it grow all
[52:52.530 --> 52:53.330]  the way up to the top.
[52:53.330 --> 52:54.890]  Hopefully have an arrow.
[52:56.010 --> 52:57.290]  And here's here's something I've
[52:57.290 --> 52:58.490]  been working on is trying to get
[52:58.490 --> 52:59.930]  these to seed out better.
[53:00.050 --> 53:01.050]  Check this out.
[53:01.290 --> 53:02.970]  Purple Elysium is kind
[53:02.970 --> 53:03.970]  of.
[53:04.370 --> 53:05.490]  That's pretty cool.
[53:06.970 --> 53:07.970]  That's really cool.
[53:08.010 --> 53:09.010]  Jalapeno
[53:09.850 --> 53:11.810]  squash, more stuff
[53:12.570 --> 53:13.970]  and things and more stuff and
[53:13.970 --> 53:14.970]  things, more
[53:15.970 --> 53:16.970]  stuff and things.
[53:20.330 --> 53:21.450]  I will switch over.
[53:25.650 --> 53:26.650]  I was killing.
[53:31.000 --> 53:32.000]  There you go.
[53:35.430 --> 53:37.030]  Beefsteak variety.
[53:37.430 --> 53:39.350]  It's like a pound one pounder.
[53:40.630 --> 53:41.630]  Pretty good.
[53:42.870 --> 53:44.030]  Cherokee purple.
[53:45.190 --> 53:46.190]  But like.
[53:47.550 --> 53:48.550]  This is a baker
[53:49.670 --> 53:50.670]  seeds.
[53:52.870 --> 53:54.190]  So pound that the
[53:55.190 --> 53:56.190]  Berkeley tie dye.
[53:57.910 --> 53:58.910]  Do you wear it?
[53:59.150 --> 54:01.070]  Pink Berkeley tie dye from them.
[54:02.230 --> 54:03.230]  Have I tried it?
[54:03.950 --> 54:05.270]  No, I just got that.
[54:05.350 --> 54:07.190]  I got those from them this year.
[54:07.910 --> 54:08.910]  Yeah.
[54:09.710 --> 54:10.630]  Nice.
[54:10.630 --> 54:11.630]  I tried to I have
[54:12.510 --> 54:14.510]  a bunch of cherries that I'm
[54:14.510 --> 54:16.830]  running through, like 24 varieties
[54:16.830 --> 54:18.870]  of cherry tomatoes.
[54:19.230 --> 54:21.150]  And I have like some strawberry
[54:21.150 --> 54:22.150]  grape.
[54:25.190 --> 54:26.190]  What's that?
[54:29.190 --> 54:30.670]  See if I could actually get a
[54:31.190 --> 54:32.190]  good image of it.
[54:32.550 --> 54:33.990]  It's really blonde looking.
[54:38.430 --> 54:40.070]  Yeah, that looks really frosty,
[54:40.070 --> 54:41.070]  buddy.
[54:41.590 --> 54:42.590]  Nice.
[54:43.550 --> 54:44.550]  Well, flavor.
[54:47.110 --> 54:48.310]  Heavy terpenelein.
[54:49.430 --> 54:51.150]  There's a there's a few variety
[54:51.150 --> 54:52.150]  various.
[54:52.190 --> 54:52.990]  I'll taste this one.
[54:52.990 --> 54:53.990]  What number is it?
[54:54.190 --> 54:55.190]  Number two.
[54:55.430 --> 54:56.190]  I don't even remember.
[54:56.550 --> 54:57.590]  I got six of them right now.
[54:57.590 --> 54:58.670]  I'm sorting through and we're going
[54:58.670 --> 55:00.670]  to sort through and on Tuesday,
[55:00.670 --> 55:01.870]  we're going to we're going to press
[55:01.870 --> 55:03.390]  them with Justin from Growing
[55:03.390 --> 55:05.390]  Exposed Remo from
[55:05.590 --> 55:06.590]  Remo Nutrients.
[55:06.630 --> 55:07.630]  Fucking Ken's
[55:08.590 --> 55:09.430]  going to be out.
[55:09.430 --> 55:10.510]  Ken Somerville is going to be able
[55:10.510 --> 55:11.710]  to visit. We're going to get John
[55:11.710 --> 55:13.030]  Barthelow, all of them
[55:13.830 --> 55:14.830]  over in one space.
[55:15.590 --> 55:16.670]  We're going to press all these and
[55:16.670 --> 55:17.910]  taste and run through them for
[55:17.910 --> 55:18.830]  flavor profile.
[55:18.830 --> 55:20.270]  But it's a pretty nice.
[55:26.680 --> 55:27.680]  It's nice, bud.
[55:27.760 --> 55:29.360]  It's a nice one. I'm happy with it.
[55:30.120 --> 55:31.400]  I'm a little bored of the flavor
[55:31.400 --> 55:32.400]  profile, to be frank.
[55:35.200 --> 55:37.000]  That happens fast for me,
[55:37.000 --> 55:38.480]  anyways, I get me
[55:38.480 --> 55:40.240]  to get to man,
[55:40.520 --> 55:42.000]  I got it. I got to try and throw in
[55:42.000 --> 55:43.520]  some variety here and there or make
[55:43.520 --> 55:45.360]  sure that I have enough out of each
[55:45.360 --> 55:46.440]  crop, there's a good amount of
[55:46.440 --> 55:47.640]  carryover that I have a good
[55:47.640 --> 55:48.640]  carryover leftover.
[55:48.840 --> 55:50.480]  There's some variety in this, but
[55:50.640 --> 55:51.920]  right now it came down like two
[55:51.920 --> 55:52.800]  weeks ago.
[55:52.800 --> 55:55.040]  So it's still really developing
[55:55.040 --> 55:55.920]  its depth of flavor.
[55:55.920 --> 55:57.080]  Like you don't really like
[55:57.720 --> 55:59.360]  have a unless you're like focusing
[55:59.920 --> 56:01.760]  in the resin or smashing it down
[56:01.760 --> 56:02.760]  or something like that.
[56:02.840 --> 56:04.960]  You kind of have this this outbound
[56:04.960 --> 56:06.560]  period that that kind of
[56:07.080 --> 56:08.720]  develops nicely over time
[56:08.720 --> 56:10.040]  and is kind of
[56:10.640 --> 56:12.520]  different. So it's it's it's
[56:12.520 --> 56:14.400]  not quite there to full
[56:14.400 --> 56:15.200]  bud flavor.
[56:15.200 --> 56:16.560]  Anyways, we're going to see what
[56:16.560 --> 56:17.760]  happens is the weekend and we'll do
[56:17.760 --> 56:19.440]  some testing and see what the TFC
[56:19.440 --> 56:20.200]  and all the condom.
[56:20.200 --> 56:21.800]  Ooh, that looks delicious.
[56:25.260 --> 56:26.260]  Trying to get a good
[56:27.060 --> 56:29.100]  fucking light on it or something,
[56:29.100 --> 56:29.500]  damn it.
[56:29.500 --> 56:30.500]  Yeah, there you go.
[56:30.500 --> 56:32.180]  I maybe I don't know
[56:32.740 --> 56:33.740]  behind it.
[56:37.220 --> 56:39.260]  Your dad is doing the best
[56:39.260 --> 56:40.220]  teamwork ever.
[56:40.220 --> 56:41.260]  We appreciate you.
[56:41.660 --> 56:42.660]  Yes, definitely.
[56:45.740 --> 56:46.900]  That looks beautiful.
[56:46.900 --> 56:47.980]  Hand trimmed.
[56:48.660 --> 56:50.620]  It's a lovely last year's
[56:50.620 --> 56:51.620]  outdoor.
[56:52.860 --> 56:54.700]  I was really impressed with
[56:54.700 --> 56:55.860]  this. This is a.
[56:56.860 --> 56:58.020]  Willie's wonder.
[57:02.210 --> 57:03.210]  Who's that through?
[57:04.690 --> 57:05.770]  The nature farm.
[57:07.290 --> 57:09.130]  He did a big project
[57:09.130 --> 57:10.330]  with Kevin Jodry.
[57:11.330 --> 57:13.010]  And that looks like some good
[57:13.010 --> 57:14.410]  density in there, man.
[57:14.410 --> 57:15.410]  Like, really?
[57:16.050 --> 57:17.770]  Yeah, that's that's not like
[57:17.850 --> 57:19.810]  I can almost smell that from here.
[57:20.810 --> 57:21.810]  That looks like
[57:22.690 --> 57:24.570]  it in sense to do some stuff
[57:24.570 --> 57:26.290]  with Willie's wonder or something.
[57:27.010 --> 57:28.010]  I can't remember.
[57:29.130 --> 57:30.690]  But like back in the day,
[57:31.370 --> 57:32.370]  things that
[57:35.130 --> 57:35.730]  do what?
[57:35.730 --> 57:37.690]  But yeah, that stuff is fucking
[57:37.690 --> 57:38.690]  insane.
[57:38.930 --> 57:39.930]  Great.
[57:40.130 --> 57:41.290]  That looks really good.
[57:42.130 --> 57:43.130]  Yeah.
[57:43.210 --> 57:44.210]  You don't turn off and
[57:48.570 --> 57:49.890]  sorry, I muted you for a second
[57:49.890 --> 57:50.930]  there, Nick. It was a little bit of
[57:50.930 --> 57:52.170]  feedback. I got you back.
[57:54.730 --> 57:56.090]  Sorry, it's hard.
[57:56.090 --> 57:58.570]  I need to set the freaking laptop
[57:58.570 --> 57:59.570]  up or so.
[58:00.410 --> 58:02.530]  Headphones, headphones are handy.
[58:02.570 --> 58:04.210]  They help with the feedback in the
[58:04.210 --> 58:05.210]  long run.
[58:05.450 --> 58:06.810]  Kind of sucks being strapped in,
[58:06.810 --> 58:08.050]  but it's not so terrible.
[58:08.050 --> 58:09.810]  I keep pulling my laptop away
[58:09.930 --> 58:11.130]  like moving shit by accident.
[58:11.130 --> 58:13.130]  It's like, yeah, you
[58:13.130 --> 58:14.930]  have the laptop going in your phone
[58:14.930 --> 58:15.930]  if you got to get up.
[58:18.170 --> 58:20.010]  Yeah, that fucking bud looks
[58:20.010 --> 58:21.010]  awesome.
[58:22.010 --> 58:23.130]  It's a good job.
[58:24.410 --> 58:25.690]  Yeah, it's not too bad.
[58:25.690 --> 58:27.490]  You know, it's really dense.
[58:27.730 --> 58:29.570]  I had a beautiful plant that grew
[58:29.570 --> 58:30.730]  like eight foot tall
[58:32.130 --> 58:33.690]  and it's really lightweight.
[58:33.730 --> 58:35.570]  You know, I grew some Kim dog
[58:36.450 --> 58:38.530]  next to this and it was just
[58:38.530 --> 58:40.410]  as blonde as the Kim dog.
[58:40.690 --> 58:42.450]  And it's got a lot of orange in it
[58:42.450 --> 58:44.290]  and it's got a like a skunk
[58:44.770 --> 58:47.170]  smell, but it's like carrots.
[58:47.210 --> 58:48.730]  It smells like carrots, but it's got
[58:48.730 --> 58:49.970]  some gas behind it.
[58:49.970 --> 58:50.970]  You know, like.
[58:51.770 --> 58:54.290]  It's it's pretty nice.
[58:55.450 --> 58:57.330]  I got some photos from
[58:57.330 --> 58:58.970]  what's coming down in flower in the
[58:58.970 --> 59:00.010]  next couple of weeks
[59:01.130 --> 59:02.650]  that I can show to you if you want.
[59:02.650 --> 59:03.370]  Oh, wait, I got it.
[59:03.370 --> 59:04.450]  I got to wait, wait, wait, before I
[59:04.450 --> 59:05.570]  do that, I got to pull up your thing
[59:05.570 --> 59:07.130]  because you sent me the Instagram
[59:07.250 --> 59:08.250]  stuff. I got to pull it up.
[59:08.570 --> 59:09.570]  Wait a second.
[59:16.950 --> 59:18.750]  There's not enough room in my office,
[59:18.750 --> 59:19.630]  London.
[59:19.630 --> 59:21.150]  There's just not enough room in my
[59:21.150 --> 59:22.030]  office.
[59:22.030 --> 59:23.430]  You need more plants in it.
[59:23.870 --> 59:24.950]  There's not enough plants.
[59:25.230 --> 59:26.550]  There aren't enough plants in your
[59:26.550 --> 59:27.550]  office.
[59:27.710 --> 59:29.630]  You know, it is this desk is so
[59:29.630 --> 59:30.630]  much more empty.
[59:30.710 --> 59:32.470]  And it's just I've been a little bit
[59:32.470 --> 59:34.590]  short on like, you know,
[59:34.630 --> 59:36.110]  like my plants for the next.
[59:36.270 --> 59:37.750]  I got like a lot coming up and I'm
[59:37.750 --> 59:38.750]  kind of
[59:39.630 --> 59:41.750]  estimating an end time around
[59:41.750 --> 59:43.750]  October to move
[59:43.750 --> 59:45.070]  out of October, November to be
[59:45.070 --> 59:46.670]  preparing to move to December.
[59:46.710 --> 59:47.790]  So it's like I don't really want to
[59:47.790 --> 59:49.590]  have like too much on the
[59:49.590 --> 59:51.230]  go. I've got a bunch of seed down.
[59:51.230 --> 59:52.510]  I got a bunch of small stuff, but
[59:52.510 --> 59:53.710]  it's like I don't have a lot of
[59:54.590 --> 59:55.510]  a lot of stuff on the go.
[59:55.510 --> 59:56.510]  I want to clones.
[59:56.590 --> 59:57.550]  Hopefully I can get a bunch more
[59:57.550 --> 59:58.550]  clones in soon.
[59:58.990 --> 01:00:00.670]  London, London,
[01:00:00.670 --> 01:00:02.270]  you look like you have the little
[01:00:02.270 --> 01:00:03.950]  shop of fucking horrors.
[01:00:04.070 --> 01:00:05.510]  It looks like the plants are going
[01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:06.510]  to eat you.
[01:00:07.070 --> 01:00:08.590]  That's how many plants you have
[01:00:09.870 --> 01:00:10.870]  overgrown.
[01:00:11.590 --> 01:00:13.390]  I love not a bad way
[01:00:14.190 --> 01:00:15.390]  in the best way ever.
[01:00:15.430 --> 01:00:16.990]  But it's like, oh, my
[01:00:16.990 --> 01:00:17.990]  God.
[01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:20.830]  I love all the varieties that
[01:00:20.830 --> 01:00:22.550]  you have, you know, like that's been
[01:00:22.550 --> 01:00:23.790]  my biggest thing.
[01:00:25.390 --> 01:00:27.070]  Just becoming, you know, loving
[01:00:27.070 --> 01:00:28.590]  the lifestyle of farming
[01:00:28.590 --> 01:00:30.110]  and gardening and plants
[01:00:30.110 --> 01:00:31.710]  is just getting the most out of
[01:00:31.710 --> 01:00:32.710]  it.
[01:00:32.710 --> 01:00:33.910]  And I love the way that you're
[01:00:33.910 --> 01:00:35.750]  talking about the plants is just
[01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:37.110]  getting the mess with all the
[01:00:37.110 --> 01:00:38.510]  varieties like,
[01:00:40.590 --> 01:00:42.350]  you know, just the simple house
[01:00:42.350 --> 01:00:44.590]  plants to the vegetables
[01:00:44.590 --> 01:00:45.590]  to the.
[01:00:46.790 --> 01:00:47.990]  No, look at Corey.
[01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:49.670]  Back it up a little bit.
[01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:50.670]  Back it up.
[01:00:50.710 --> 01:00:52.310]  Put your put your hand in front of
[01:00:52.310 --> 01:00:53.790]  the screen for a second.
[01:00:53.950 --> 01:00:55.270]  Like, hold it. So it fucks up the
[01:00:55.270 --> 01:00:56.510]  screen. Yeah. Like, put it right in
[01:00:56.510 --> 01:00:57.750]  front. Right in front. So screws it
[01:00:57.750 --> 01:00:59.550]  up. But keep the camera close.
[01:00:59.870 --> 01:01:01.270]  But keep the camera close to the
[01:01:01.270 --> 01:01:02.190]  weed.
[01:01:02.230 --> 01:01:03.230]  Yeah.
[01:01:04.430 --> 01:01:05.430]  Almost.
[01:01:05.630 --> 01:01:06.630]  Yeah.
[01:01:07.990 --> 01:01:08.990]  What is that?
[01:01:09.030 --> 01:01:10.910]  Like Nick was saying, I can't get
[01:01:10.910 --> 01:01:11.910]  it right.
[01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:12.910]  I don't know what.
[01:01:14.470 --> 01:01:15.470]  Angle with me.
[01:01:16.190 --> 01:01:17.630]  It's really pretty, man.
[01:01:17.950 --> 01:01:19.510]  Is that your indoor that you pulled
[01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:20.230]  down?
[01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:22.430]  Yeah, that's some
[01:01:24.590 --> 01:01:25.590]  dark sunset.
[01:01:28.190 --> 01:01:29.830]  Where are you located,
[01:01:29.830 --> 01:01:30.630]  T.Y. Grote?
[01:01:30.630 --> 01:01:32.750]  I am. I am available to take
[01:01:32.750 --> 01:01:34.790]  plants if you have them
[01:01:34.790 --> 01:01:35.790]  available.
[01:01:35.790 --> 01:01:37.590]  I would if you're in the Pacific,
[01:01:37.750 --> 01:01:38.710]  if you're in B.C.
[01:01:38.710 --> 01:01:40.430]  and you got some some stuff to fuck
[01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:42.310]  around with right now, I am so in the
[01:01:42.310 --> 01:01:44.750]  fucking mood and you will never,
[01:01:45.230 --> 01:01:47.030]  ever, ever hear me say
[01:01:47.030 --> 01:01:48.950]  that. OK, like it's like every time
[01:01:48.950 --> 01:01:50.430]  anybody has ever offered me plants,
[01:01:50.430 --> 01:01:52.110]  it's always been like, oh, yeah,
[01:01:52.510 --> 01:01:54.510]  you know, six months, you
[01:01:54.510 --> 01:01:56.590]  know, like, OK, maybe three
[01:01:56.590 --> 01:01:58.430]  months, you know, maybe maybe
[01:01:58.430 --> 01:02:00.150]  like, yeah, I don't know.
[01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:02.230]  You know, I got a lot of stuff I want
[01:02:02.230 --> 01:02:02.990]  to work through.
[01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:05.150]  It's like it's always is always.
[01:02:05.550 --> 01:02:06.630]  Yeah, I'm sorry.
[01:02:06.630 --> 01:02:08.590]  Yes. CT, that's probably not
[01:02:08.590 --> 01:02:09.590]  going to work.
[01:02:10.150 --> 01:02:11.430]  I want. Yeah, I want to.
[01:02:11.430 --> 01:02:12.670]  Yeah, right now I'm down.
[01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:15.750]  I wanted to offer all y'all fucking
[01:02:15.750 --> 01:02:16.910]  plans of everything.
[01:02:17.230 --> 01:02:19.150]  But like the
[01:02:19.150 --> 01:02:21.150]  fucking shit had fucking
[01:02:21.150 --> 01:02:22.990]  mites all over it because my dog is
[01:02:22.990 --> 01:02:23.990]  an asshole.
[01:02:24.270 --> 01:02:25.750]  So don't send me
[01:02:25.750 --> 01:02:27.110]  my going to me, mates.
[01:02:28.230 --> 01:02:29.390]  Yeah, I'm not going to
[01:02:30.830 --> 01:02:32.630]  basically throw that on
[01:02:32.710 --> 01:02:33.870]  every one of y'all.
[01:02:34.110 --> 01:02:35.110]  You know what I mean?
[01:02:35.950 --> 01:02:37.750]  So what I'm going to do is
[01:02:37.750 --> 01:02:39.790]  basically just make seeds this
[01:02:39.790 --> 01:02:41.710]  year and hopefully by
[01:02:41.710 --> 01:02:43.470]  the end of December have seeds
[01:02:43.470 --> 01:02:45.310]  and I'll give some seeds to each
[01:02:45.310 --> 01:02:47.430]  of y'all for free and
[01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:50.070]  then we'll sell them through FCP
[01:02:50.390 --> 01:02:52.270]  if they allow me to.
[01:02:52.430 --> 01:02:54.270]  And that's how I'll just
[01:02:54.270 --> 01:02:55.270]  work it out. But.
[01:02:57.590 --> 01:02:59.670]  Yeah, I am not going
[01:02:59.670 --> 01:03:01.510]  to be throwing fucking clones
[01:03:01.510 --> 01:03:03.390]  on people that are fucking full of
[01:03:03.390 --> 01:03:05.030]  fucking mites and shit on them.
[01:03:05.310 --> 01:03:07.350]  Like we got white flies,
[01:03:07.350 --> 01:03:08.550]  mites and like.
[01:03:10.110 --> 01:03:12.270]  It all came from the dog.
[01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:14.750]  I never had these problems
[01:03:14.750 --> 01:03:16.750]  like for like 15 fucking
[01:03:16.750 --> 01:03:18.190]  years, never had these problems.
[01:03:18.830 --> 01:03:20.430]  You got to give into it, man.
[01:03:21.030 --> 01:03:22.070]  OK, I'm going to tell you something.
[01:03:22.070 --> 01:03:23.830]  OK, yesterday
[01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:26.470]  I caught a bug with
[01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:28.470]  my hands and I opened
[01:03:28.470 --> 01:03:29.910]  it and it was a lace swing.
[01:03:29.950 --> 01:03:32.150]  OK, and these things are like five
[01:03:32.150 --> 01:03:33.350]  bucks a fucking pop.
[01:03:33.590 --> 01:03:35.230]  And for once I didn't crush the
[01:03:35.230 --> 01:03:36.750]  fucking piece of shit because it
[01:03:36.750 --> 01:03:38.710]  buzzed by my goddamn head.
[01:03:39.030 --> 01:03:40.830]  So you just got like I know it sucks
[01:03:40.830 --> 01:03:42.110]  and it's weird and your wife will
[01:03:42.110 --> 01:03:43.950]  probably like we know about it.
[01:03:43.950 --> 01:03:45.790]  But you know what happens now is
[01:03:45.790 --> 01:03:47.950]  now I don't have ants in my house
[01:03:48.030 --> 01:03:49.310]  anymore for some reason.
[01:03:49.790 --> 01:03:51.150]  You know, all the other bugs are
[01:03:51.150 --> 01:03:52.910]  gone. You know, I saw this year is
[01:03:52.910 --> 01:03:54.630]  like some of the craziest looking
[01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:56.830]  dragonflies I've ever seen,
[01:03:56.830 --> 01:03:57.990]  like all sorts of like kind of
[01:03:57.990 --> 01:03:59.990]  little ones and bigger ones, like
[01:03:59.990 --> 01:04:02.150]  all sorts of weird, weird bugs.
[01:04:02.150 --> 01:04:04.070]  And I was like because the neighbors
[01:04:04.070 --> 01:04:06.270]  sprayed poison for fucking years
[01:04:06.270 --> 01:04:07.350]  and I've been only using like
[01:04:07.350 --> 01:04:08.590]  predatory bugs and I stopped
[01:04:08.590 --> 01:04:10.070]  spraying. It's just like it's so
[01:04:10.070 --> 01:04:11.070]  nice. So it's
[01:04:12.190 --> 01:04:13.190]  like a fucking new world.
[01:04:13.230 --> 01:04:14.870]  You got to give in to the bugs and
[01:04:14.870 --> 01:04:16.270]  just live with them in you.
[01:04:16.550 --> 01:04:18.430]  Sometimes we're in the car of
[01:04:18.430 --> 01:04:20.310]  my house on my way from
[01:04:20.310 --> 01:04:21.990]  somewhere and there's a crazy
[01:04:21.990 --> 01:04:23.630]  mite like those little red fucking
[01:04:23.630 --> 01:04:25.550]  mites that eat shit like in the on
[01:04:25.550 --> 01:04:27.070]  the window, like just holding on for
[01:04:27.070 --> 01:04:28.750]  dear life on the outside of it.
[01:04:28.750 --> 01:04:30.870]  I swear to God, it totally
[01:04:30.870 --> 01:04:31.870]  happened.
[01:04:32.190 --> 01:04:33.550]  We were coming back from soccer and
[01:04:33.550 --> 01:04:34.790]  there's a fucking crazy man on
[01:04:34.790 --> 01:04:36.350]  there. You just you just you become
[01:04:36.350 --> 01:04:37.510]  one with the bugs.
[01:04:38.430 --> 01:04:39.430]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:04:39.870 --> 01:04:41.590]  I love like I love like the
[01:04:41.590 --> 01:04:43.430]  roly poly's like I'll pick
[01:04:43.430 --> 01:04:45.270]  them up off the ground and I'll
[01:04:45.270 --> 01:04:46.830]  just be like, now you're going into
[01:04:46.830 --> 01:04:47.830]  my 50 gallon.
[01:04:48.110 --> 01:04:49.790]  Like I got like four 50 gallon
[01:04:49.790 --> 01:04:51.710]  containers as we can have
[01:04:51.710 --> 01:04:53.550]  four containers
[01:04:53.630 --> 01:04:54.830]  for state
[01:04:55.750 --> 01:04:57.590]  per whatever residence
[01:04:57.590 --> 01:04:58.590]  and.
[01:04:59.670 --> 01:05:01.630]  And it's like
[01:05:01.630 --> 01:05:03.070]  fucking hilarious because
[01:05:03.430 --> 01:05:05.390]  it's just like, no, now you're going
[01:05:05.390 --> 01:05:07.030]  in here, now you're going here and
[01:05:07.030 --> 01:05:08.870]  all the little early polies just go
[01:05:08.870 --> 01:05:10.870]  in there and it's it's
[01:05:10.870 --> 01:05:11.870]  this.
[01:05:13.070 --> 01:05:14.950]  I, I don't even
[01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:16.430]  know why people pay for them.
[01:05:16.670 --> 01:05:18.350]  I kind of want to go and like
[01:05:18.350 --> 01:05:20.750]  support the other people on FCP
[01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:21.750]  that do the
[01:05:22.350 --> 01:05:23.750]  rubber ducky isopod.
[01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:25.670]  Shout out to shout out to him.
[01:05:25.830 --> 01:05:27.830]  Dude, those are so cool.
[01:05:27.830 --> 01:05:29.710]  Like the little dairy cows and
[01:05:29.710 --> 01:05:31.030]  stuff. Did you guys watch his
[01:05:31.030 --> 01:05:32.110]  episode the other day?
[01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:34.590]  You shout out and like if you're
[01:05:34.590 --> 01:05:35.870]  bored after this, go watch that
[01:05:35.870 --> 01:05:37.790]  because that was just genuine
[01:05:37.790 --> 01:05:38.990]  and really, really good.
[01:05:38.990 --> 01:05:40.870]  And they covered a lot of fun stuff.
[01:05:41.110 --> 01:05:41.950]  Yeah, they did.
[01:05:41.950 --> 01:05:43.950]  They put on a lot of great content.
[01:05:45.350 --> 01:05:47.390]  I just I want to support them,
[01:05:47.390 --> 01:05:49.390]  you know, and but I don't
[01:05:49.390 --> 01:05:51.550]  even know what to fucking select.
[01:05:51.590 --> 01:05:53.550]  Like I can meet just all
[01:05:53.590 --> 01:05:55.390]  these early polies are just rolling
[01:05:55.390 --> 01:05:56.390]  polies.
[01:05:56.390 --> 01:05:57.990]  Throw them in the damn fucking
[01:05:57.990 --> 01:05:58.990]  soil.
[01:05:59.590 --> 01:06:01.510]  Like that's the way I
[01:06:01.510 --> 01:06:03.390]  go at it. And same thing with arms
[01:06:03.390 --> 01:06:04.150]  and everything else.
[01:06:04.150 --> 01:06:06.230]  It's like, you know, let them go at
[01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:08.150]  it and and they'll do it,
[01:06:08.470 --> 01:06:09.670]  you know, and that's it.
[01:06:10.470 --> 01:06:11.470]  But
[01:06:12.790 --> 01:06:14.470]  there's there's other scientists
[01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:16.270]  that are more,
[01:06:17.790 --> 01:06:19.590]  I guess, attuned to whatever
[01:06:19.590 --> 01:06:21.470]  they they know with with
[01:06:21.470 --> 01:06:23.470]  all this stuff, because I am
[01:06:23.470 --> 01:06:25.430]  a scientist, but I'm not a scientist
[01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:26.270]  in that stuff.
[01:06:26.270 --> 01:06:28.350]  So that that doesn't really
[01:06:28.350 --> 01:06:30.350]  allow me to know
[01:06:30.350 --> 01:06:31.830]  exactly what
[01:06:32.910 --> 01:06:33.910]  their
[01:06:34.630 --> 01:06:36.910]  specific, I guess, ideas
[01:06:37.350 --> 01:06:39.510]  for what to put into
[01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:40.750]  the soil would be.
[01:06:41.670 --> 01:06:43.710]  And so I would really like,
[01:06:43.710 --> 01:06:45.230]  yeah, I'd appreciate and.
[01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:48.710]  And yeah, I'd
[01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:50.510]  really like to try and go in that
[01:06:50.510 --> 01:06:52.110]  direction and like try and talk to
[01:06:52.110 --> 01:06:54.110]  those folks and and
[01:06:54.110 --> 01:06:56.350]  talk to them about like, OK,
[01:06:56.350 --> 01:06:58.150]  do I get these isopods, these
[01:06:58.150 --> 01:07:00.350]  isopods and then try
[01:07:00.350 --> 01:07:01.590]  to do this, that and the other.
[01:07:01.590 --> 01:07:03.390]  Because we've already set up
[01:07:03.390 --> 01:07:04.750]  our horizontal soil.
[01:07:04.750 --> 01:07:06.110]  We've already gotten everything all
[01:07:06.110 --> 01:07:07.110]  set up. So
[01:07:08.710 --> 01:07:09.710]  we're just.
[01:07:12.830 --> 01:07:14.670]  We're just jamming at it with this
[01:07:14.670 --> 01:07:15.750]  whole thing now.
[01:07:17.150 --> 01:07:18.150]  So.
[01:07:19.950 --> 01:07:22.070]  I love I love all their methods,
[01:07:22.790 --> 01:07:24.390]  they're really great show and just
[01:07:24.390 --> 01:07:25.550]  genuinely good people.
[01:07:25.550 --> 01:07:26.910]  I got to have a good chat with Brian
[01:07:26.910 --> 01:07:28.430]  the other day. That's really nice.
[01:07:28.430 --> 01:07:30.470]  And I think some of those isopods,
[01:07:30.470 --> 01:07:31.630]  like Brian was saying,
[01:07:32.830 --> 01:07:34.550]  you know, they they collect them.
[01:07:34.550 --> 01:07:36.470]  They're almost pets, you know.
[01:07:38.070 --> 01:07:39.070]  And I think there's.
[01:07:40.030 --> 01:07:42.110]  The cost reflects that.
[01:07:42.110 --> 01:07:43.550]  I think there's some that you can use
[01:07:43.550 --> 01:07:45.790]  as genuine workers that are
[01:07:45.790 --> 01:07:46.910]  much lower on the.
[01:07:48.150 --> 01:07:50.510]  On the price scale, I
[01:07:50.510 --> 01:07:52.510]  thought that the dairy cows was kind
[01:07:52.510 --> 01:07:54.550]  of the way to go to just like throw
[01:07:54.550 --> 01:07:55.590]  them in there if you already got it,
[01:07:55.590 --> 01:07:57.470]  because I have a like
[01:07:57.470 --> 01:07:58.470]  a lot of isopods.
[01:07:59.630 --> 01:08:01.390]  Like they're they're they're
[01:08:01.390 --> 01:08:03.110]  problematic at times like they
[01:08:03.110 --> 01:08:04.550]  fuck they fuck stuff up.
[01:08:04.550 --> 01:08:05.670]  They like they like getting to my
[01:08:05.670 --> 01:08:07.870]  celery root and
[01:08:07.870 --> 01:08:09.950]  do all sorts of bad stuff and try
[01:08:09.950 --> 01:08:11.590]  and find holes where there's water
[01:08:11.590 --> 01:08:12.670]  and things like that.
[01:08:12.670 --> 01:08:14.350]  So it's like I get
[01:08:14.350 --> 01:08:15.990]  I hear what he's saying.
[01:08:15.990 --> 01:08:17.830]  I've never really constituted
[01:08:17.830 --> 01:08:19.710]  them as a problem for my weed,
[01:08:19.710 --> 01:08:21.230]  but they really fuck everything
[01:08:21.230 --> 01:08:22.990]  else up. So if I could like put
[01:08:22.990 --> 01:08:24.670]  another population out there that
[01:08:24.670 --> 01:08:26.750]  just continues to populate like
[01:08:26.750 --> 01:08:28.150]  the ones that I already have, but
[01:08:28.150 --> 01:08:30.070]  will eat them or something like
[01:08:30.070 --> 01:08:30.990]  I'm down with that.
[01:08:30.990 --> 01:08:32.510]  That sounds like that sounds like a
[01:08:32.510 --> 01:08:33.910]  nudge I could get behind.
[01:08:33.910 --> 01:08:34.910]  You know what I mean?
[01:08:35.910 --> 01:08:38.390]  I just try to utilize
[01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:41.670]  is top and bottom
[01:08:41.670 --> 01:08:44.310]  dwelling east
[01:08:44.310 --> 01:08:47.230]  in my IMO
[01:08:47.230 --> 01:08:49.590]  to try and help with everything.
[01:08:49.590 --> 01:08:51.550]  And I know that's not the same
[01:08:51.550 --> 01:08:53.390]  as like actual
[01:08:53.390 --> 01:08:55.270]  bugs going around moving and
[01:08:55.270 --> 01:08:56.110]  doing things.
[01:08:56.110 --> 01:08:58.310]  But I
[01:08:58.310 --> 01:09:00.190]  feel like trying to
[01:09:00.190 --> 01:09:02.350]  use two different types of yeast
[01:09:02.350 --> 01:09:04.670]  kind of like they'll they will
[01:09:04.670 --> 01:09:05.670]  kind of.
[01:09:07.990 --> 01:09:10.150]  They'll stay like kind of
[01:09:10.150 --> 01:09:12.430]  stabilize where they're at and
[01:09:12.430 --> 01:09:14.910]  like even if you make a container
[01:09:14.910 --> 01:09:16.510]  with both of them in it, they will
[01:09:16.510 --> 01:09:18.150]  still stabilize.
[01:09:18.150 --> 01:09:20.630]  And when you throw them into some
[01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:23.230]  form of like oil,
[01:09:23.230 --> 01:09:24.230]  it'll work.
[01:09:26.910 --> 01:09:29.190]  I've done this for years and
[01:09:29.190 --> 01:09:32.190]  it it does work.
[01:09:32.190 --> 01:09:34.590]  It just it's one of those things
[01:09:34.590 --> 01:09:36.950]  like you you've got to like.
[01:09:38.510 --> 01:09:41.310]  Be really careful with like
[01:09:41.310 --> 01:09:42.910]  whatever you're using to drive the
[01:09:42.910 --> 01:09:44.870]  fucking yeast like
[01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:46.990]  that, like if you like, for example,
[01:09:46.990 --> 01:09:49.310]  you're using bananas,
[01:09:49.310 --> 01:09:51.310]  you've got to be careful that like
[01:09:51.310 --> 01:09:52.790]  there's going to be a lot of potassium
[01:09:52.790 --> 01:09:55.270]  now in that liquid.
[01:09:55.270 --> 01:09:57.190]  So then you got to know,
[01:09:57.190 --> 01:09:59.270]  OK, you're throwing more potassium
[01:09:59.270 --> 01:10:00.270]  in there.
[01:10:00.550 --> 01:10:02.430]  You know, don't be using
[01:10:02.430 --> 01:10:04.830]  more potassium nutrient,
[01:10:04.830 --> 01:10:06.910]  you know, or whatever.
[01:10:06.910 --> 01:10:08.830]  And like other than
[01:10:08.830 --> 01:10:10.830]  that, it's one
[01:10:10.830 --> 01:10:13.630]  of these like it's really simple
[01:10:13.630 --> 01:10:14.670]  as shit.
[01:10:14.670 --> 01:10:15.670]  It's like.
[01:10:17.510 --> 01:10:20.110]  Let the crap just
[01:10:20.110 --> 01:10:21.790]  all just
[01:10:21.790 --> 01:10:24.230]  meld together and
[01:10:24.230 --> 01:10:25.230]  get broke.
[01:10:25.830 --> 01:10:26.830]  And
[01:10:29.070 --> 01:10:31.110]  and that's I
[01:10:31.110 --> 01:10:32.830]  hate to say it, but
[01:10:32.830 --> 01:10:34.510]  it's like, yeah, that's that's the
[01:10:34.510 --> 01:10:35.510]  way
[01:10:36.190 --> 01:10:38.190]  it ultimately
[01:10:38.190 --> 01:10:40.190]  works out is
[01:10:40.190 --> 01:10:41.190]  is that.
[01:10:43.870 --> 01:10:46.030]  Yeah, I like to use IMOs
[01:10:46.030 --> 01:10:48.030]  and stuff, you
[01:10:48.030 --> 01:10:49.350]  know, I have a few that I've been
[01:10:49.350 --> 01:10:50.350]  working with.
[01:10:51.550 --> 01:10:53.670]  I really, really like
[01:10:53.670 --> 01:10:55.950]  the the FFA.
[01:10:57.630 --> 01:11:00.110]  That's a good one, man.
[01:11:00.110 --> 01:11:02.150]  I kind of do my own like how
[01:11:03.430 --> 01:11:05.270]  you know, you guys say you
[01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:07.110]  use a little bit of fish shit,
[01:11:07.110 --> 01:11:08.110]  Corey.
[01:11:08.110 --> 01:11:10.030]  Yeah, I make well,
[01:11:10.030 --> 01:11:11.710]  I go catfish and we got a river
[01:11:11.710 --> 01:11:13.270]  nearby and
[01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:16.230]  man, well, we got this fifty five
[01:11:16.230 --> 01:11:18.870]  gallon drum and we'll put
[01:11:18.870 --> 01:11:20.710]  we'll cut the meat out that we want
[01:11:20.710 --> 01:11:22.510]  to eat and we'll catch, you know,
[01:11:22.510 --> 01:11:25.070]  probably like ten, fifteen,
[01:11:25.070 --> 01:11:26.990]  eight to twenty pounders
[01:11:26.990 --> 01:11:28.790]  on a rod, you know, we'll go out
[01:11:28.790 --> 01:11:30.670]  and fish all night.
[01:11:30.670 --> 01:11:32.910]  The last weekend of
[01:11:32.910 --> 01:11:35.590]  September every year
[01:11:35.590 --> 01:11:36.590]  and
[01:11:38.630 --> 01:11:40.670]  man, and we catch we catch the shit
[01:11:40.670 --> 01:11:41.670]  out of and
[01:11:41.990 --> 01:11:43.510]  well, I mean, not September,
[01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:45.110]  last weekend of August
[01:11:45.110 --> 01:11:46.910]  and we'll put
[01:11:46.910 --> 01:11:49.150]  them in a barrel with water
[01:11:49.150 --> 01:11:51.390]  and we'll let the water just
[01:11:51.390 --> 01:11:53.110]  melt the fish,
[01:11:53.110 --> 01:11:55.110]  you know, bones, meat and
[01:11:55.110 --> 01:11:57.030]  all and eventually maggots start
[01:11:57.030 --> 01:11:58.430]  crawling in there.
[01:11:58.430 --> 01:12:00.230]  And we met the we made a mistake
[01:12:00.230 --> 01:12:02.150]  the first year that we did it.
[01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:05.590]  We used one that was painted
[01:12:05.590 --> 01:12:07.790]  inside and the paint
[01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:09.310]  killed the maggots.
[01:12:09.310 --> 01:12:10.950]  And when we put that stuff in the
[01:12:10.950 --> 01:12:13.230]  we put that stuff on our plant,
[01:12:13.230 --> 01:12:15.190]  it killed all of our plants because
[01:12:15.190 --> 01:12:17.430]  the paint was toxic at that point.
[01:12:17.430 --> 01:12:19.710]  But man, we've
[01:12:19.710 --> 01:12:21.830]  figured from then on,
[01:12:21.830 --> 01:12:23.990]  you know, if we saw maggots crawling,
[01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:25.190]  it was good.
[01:12:25.190 --> 01:12:27.190]  And we did you have to
[01:12:27.190 --> 01:12:28.870]  hold your nose or something because
[01:12:28.870 --> 01:12:30.710]  it's the worst foul
[01:12:30.710 --> 01:12:32.910]  smelling stuff you ever
[01:12:32.910 --> 01:12:34.390]  buy. I mean, like these maggots is
[01:12:34.390 --> 01:12:37.030]  like melted the meat
[01:12:37.030 --> 01:12:39.230]  off the bones and then the bones
[01:12:39.230 --> 01:12:41.030]  have disintegrated, you know, and
[01:12:41.030 --> 01:12:43.150]  the maggots have like chewed it all
[01:12:43.150 --> 01:12:44.870]  up. And it's like this
[01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:46.830]  surfy, softy mess,
[01:12:46.830 --> 01:12:48.670]  you know, like I feel like the fish
[01:12:48.670 --> 01:12:50.510]  stuff, it stinks, you
[01:12:50.510 --> 01:12:51.750]  know what I mean? But it's still
[01:12:51.750 --> 01:12:52.670]  clean.
[01:12:52.670 --> 01:12:54.630]  Like it's really clean because
[01:12:54.630 --> 01:12:56.350]  they got to do
[01:12:56.350 --> 01:12:57.350]  that to sell it.
[01:12:57.350 --> 01:12:58.790]  A lot of it.
[01:12:58.790 --> 01:13:00.710]  Yeah. I mean, this stuff's so
[01:13:00.710 --> 01:13:02.670]  bad and don't get it on you.
[01:13:02.670 --> 01:13:03.670]  Do not get it on.
[01:13:03.670 --> 01:13:05.950]  You can't you'll smell it for a week
[01:13:05.950 --> 01:13:07.790]  and you just get you a little.
[01:13:07.790 --> 01:13:10.310]  I mean, literally a cup full
[01:13:10.310 --> 01:13:12.350]  and you'll pour it on your plant
[01:13:12.350 --> 01:13:14.110]  and you can watch the plants, they'll
[01:13:14.110 --> 01:13:15.830]  like vibrate.
[01:13:16.910 --> 01:13:18.710]  But those maggots are out there
[01:13:18.710 --> 01:13:21.150]  and within a day to
[01:13:21.150 --> 01:13:22.390]  one day.
[01:13:22.390 --> 01:13:24.390]  But man, I really
[01:13:24.390 --> 01:13:26.310]  like to mix just a little bit of
[01:13:26.310 --> 01:13:29.310]  that, like a teaspoon of that
[01:13:29.310 --> 01:13:31.350]  with my name oil or my
[01:13:31.350 --> 01:13:33.230]  cron when I do my full
[01:13:33.230 --> 01:13:35.550]  your sprays and something about
[01:13:35.550 --> 01:13:37.310]  adding like fish
[01:13:37.310 --> 01:13:39.230]  emulsion like FAA or
[01:13:39.230 --> 01:13:41.990]  something about just that microbial
[01:13:41.990 --> 01:13:43.790]  that are in fish
[01:13:43.790 --> 01:13:45.310]  is just it
[01:13:45.310 --> 01:13:47.390]  could it's
[01:13:47.390 --> 01:13:49.270]  so synergistic to your
[01:13:49.270 --> 01:13:51.350]  foliar spray that
[01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:53.350]  it just it's a game changer.
[01:13:53.350 --> 01:13:55.430]  I mean, like, you know, you're
[01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:57.550]  batting tests and fighting
[01:13:57.550 --> 01:13:59.350]  them and you're you know, you can't
[01:13:59.350 --> 01:14:01.310]  spray the same thing over and
[01:14:01.310 --> 01:14:02.390]  over and over again.
[01:14:02.390 --> 01:14:03.230]  You're going to lose.
[01:14:03.230 --> 01:14:04.830]  You got to switch it up.
[01:14:04.830 --> 01:14:06.830]  And so here I got a question
[01:14:06.830 --> 01:14:09.230]  for you, man, because I like for me
[01:14:09.230 --> 01:14:10.630]  like
[01:14:11.030 --> 01:14:13.510]  names, the antimicrobial
[01:14:13.510 --> 01:14:15.630]  right, like it kills most bacteria
[01:14:15.630 --> 01:14:16.390]  and fungus.
[01:14:16.390 --> 01:14:18.230]  Right. So I wouldn't putting
[01:14:18.230 --> 01:14:20.030]  your microbes and bacteria and with
[01:14:20.030 --> 01:14:22.470]  your name spray be counterproductive.
[01:14:22.470 --> 01:14:22.950]  You know what I mean?
[01:14:22.950 --> 01:14:24.910]  Like I because I used to do the same
[01:14:24.910 --> 01:14:26.350]  thing and I was thinking about it one
[01:14:26.350 --> 01:14:28.270]  day and I was talking to a micro.
[01:14:28.270 --> 01:14:29.470]  I'm like, what do you think about this,
[01:14:29.470 --> 01:14:31.710]  man? I'm like, do you think
[01:14:31.710 --> 01:14:33.230]  like because I mean, you won't kill
[01:14:33.230 --> 01:14:35.270]  all of them by any means,
[01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:37.550]  but you might not have the optimum
[01:14:37.550 --> 01:14:38.910]  thing is doing them as separate
[01:14:38.910 --> 01:14:40.390]  sprays, like hitting one in the
[01:14:40.390 --> 01:14:42.270]  morning and then doing one
[01:14:42.270 --> 01:14:43.590]  in the evening or something like
[01:14:43.590 --> 01:14:45.230]  that, like rotating through them
[01:14:45.230 --> 01:14:46.910]  instead of doing them together as a
[01:14:46.910 --> 01:14:47.910]  mix.
[01:14:48.030 --> 01:14:49.950]  I can see that I
[01:14:49.950 --> 01:14:51.630]  didn't ever really think of it like
[01:14:51.630 --> 01:14:52.630]  that,
[01:14:53.190 --> 01:14:55.390]  you know, but I can definitely
[01:14:55.390 --> 01:14:56.950]  do that. I could.
[01:14:56.950 --> 01:14:58.470]  Yeah, that's a very good point
[01:14:58.470 --> 01:14:59.470]  there.
[01:15:00.790 --> 01:15:02.270]  I don't know. That was just something
[01:15:02.270 --> 01:15:03.990]  you know, I buy a lot of boogie
[01:15:04.030 --> 01:15:05.030]  brew products.
[01:15:05.030 --> 01:15:06.790]  I'm not sponsoring them or
[01:15:06.790 --> 01:15:08.510]  anything, but I think I
[01:15:08.510 --> 01:15:10.590]  think John John
[01:15:10.590 --> 01:15:12.630]  Collier, the grow your own greens
[01:15:12.630 --> 01:15:14.030]  guy, he's really
[01:15:15.790 --> 01:15:17.670]  really specific to
[01:15:17.670 --> 01:15:19.870]  some of the things that he does
[01:15:19.870 --> 01:15:21.790]  and staying as clean as
[01:15:21.790 --> 01:15:22.790]  he can
[01:15:24.030 --> 01:15:25.470]  on the organic side.
[01:15:25.470 --> 01:15:27.350]  And so I just kind of that was
[01:15:27.350 --> 01:15:29.430]  one of their their things they
[01:15:29.430 --> 01:15:31.070]  mentioned on their website, you
[01:15:31.070 --> 01:15:32.070]  know, and
[01:15:32.990 --> 01:15:34.750]  when you buy some of their products
[01:15:34.750 --> 01:15:36.750]  and I really when I can't make
[01:15:36.750 --> 01:15:38.470]  the fish stuff, I'll buy his
[01:15:39.390 --> 01:15:41.390]  his premium pure protein
[01:15:41.390 --> 01:15:42.110]  stuff.
[01:15:42.110 --> 01:15:44.150]  And then he's got hydroslate
[01:15:44.150 --> 01:15:46.430]  that's more phosphorus based, but
[01:15:46.430 --> 01:15:48.430]  the pure protein is nitrogen based.
[01:15:48.430 --> 01:15:50.590]  And most of the time I'm in veg
[01:15:50.590 --> 01:15:52.630]  when I'm doing a compost
[01:15:52.630 --> 01:15:54.670]  tea microbial
[01:15:54.670 --> 01:15:56.430]  sometime, you know, boost.
[01:15:56.430 --> 01:15:58.310]  And that was just one
[01:15:58.310 --> 01:15:59.390]  thing they mentioned.
[01:15:59.390 --> 01:16:01.030]  And ever since I've been doing that
[01:16:01.030 --> 01:16:02.830]  for like the last year and a half,
[01:16:02.830 --> 01:16:04.990]  two years, it's
[01:16:04.990 --> 01:16:06.910]  been a game changer for me, but I've
[01:16:06.910 --> 01:16:09.750]  never tried them separately
[01:16:09.750 --> 01:16:10.510]  like that.
[01:16:10.510 --> 01:16:12.430]  I would definitely like to
[01:16:12.430 --> 01:16:14.470]  do a test off to the side,
[01:16:14.470 --> 01:16:16.110]  you know, like everything you guys
[01:16:16.110 --> 01:16:18.190]  saw in the garden, all
[01:16:18.190 --> 01:16:19.790]  that is tester stuff.
[01:16:19.790 --> 01:16:22.270]  Like I don't run that commercially.
[01:16:22.270 --> 01:16:23.670]  It's just something that stood out
[01:16:23.670 --> 01:16:25.150]  inside. I'm seeing if it works
[01:16:25.150 --> 01:16:26.590]  outside.
[01:16:26.590 --> 01:16:28.110]  I look around.
[01:16:28.110 --> 01:16:30.070]  I love that fuck around plants, baby.
[01:16:30.070 --> 01:16:31.510]  That's all I got is a bunch of fuck
[01:16:31.510 --> 01:16:32.390]  around plants.
[01:16:32.390 --> 01:16:34.190]  Like I got a big old
[01:16:34.190 --> 01:16:34.790]  bottle of neem.
[01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:36.830]  Like I got no objections
[01:16:36.830 --> 01:16:38.670]  to neem or using that or any
[01:16:38.670 --> 01:16:40.230]  of those things in any way, shape
[01:16:40.230 --> 01:16:42.030]  or form. I was just like I've always
[01:16:42.030 --> 01:16:43.950]  kind of there's some things that like
[01:16:43.950 --> 01:16:46.070]  have, you know, the doctor
[01:16:46.070 --> 01:16:47.990]  laying in him like put on your tinfoil
[01:16:47.990 --> 01:16:49.590]  hat and ask the question like, does
[01:16:49.590 --> 01:16:52.270]  that make like all the way
[01:16:52.270 --> 01:16:53.950]  sense all the time?
[01:16:53.950 --> 01:16:56.390]  And I've just kind of like wondered
[01:16:56.390 --> 01:16:57.390]  about some of these things.
[01:16:57.390 --> 01:16:59.550]  I'm afraid to use it inside my tent
[01:16:59.550 --> 01:17:01.670]  because I use predatory mites.
[01:17:01.670 --> 01:17:02.910]  Exactly.
[01:17:02.910 --> 01:17:04.030]  Yeah. Yeah.
[01:17:04.030 --> 01:17:05.310]  It's bad for bees.
[01:17:05.310 --> 01:17:07.030]  And, you know, I have bees around, but
[01:17:07.030 --> 01:17:09.750]  I always tried to keep them
[01:17:09.750 --> 01:17:11.750]  separate. You know, they're
[01:17:11.750 --> 01:17:13.590]  not really bees are
[01:17:13.590 --> 01:17:14.510]  really around.
[01:17:14.510 --> 01:17:16.470]  They're almost sunflowers more than
[01:17:16.470 --> 01:17:18.510]  there's a time and place for everything.
[01:17:18.510 --> 01:17:19.910]  Right. Right. Exactly.
[01:17:19.910 --> 01:17:21.950]  You know, but do you guys use
[01:17:21.950 --> 01:17:22.950]  Kronja?
[01:17:24.990 --> 01:17:26.950]  I just don't spray anything other than
[01:17:27.590 --> 01:17:28.590]  Kronja.
[01:17:28.590 --> 01:17:29.670]  I don't know.
[01:17:29.670 --> 01:17:31.710]  Because Kronja, man.
[01:17:31.710 --> 01:17:33.750]  So I've literally had I've
[01:17:33.750 --> 01:17:35.710]  sprayed Kronja and
[01:17:35.710 --> 01:17:37.750]  Neem have a synergistic
[01:17:37.750 --> 01:17:38.750]  formality.
[01:17:39.630 --> 01:17:41.030]  What is Kronja?
[01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:42.830]  Can you like is I don't know exactly
[01:17:42.830 --> 01:17:43.710]  what Kronja is.
[01:17:43.710 --> 01:17:45.630]  So, you know, Neem is like
[01:17:45.630 --> 01:17:49.350]  the bacterial fungicide
[01:17:49.350 --> 01:17:50.670]  spray. Like you said, it's a
[01:17:50.670 --> 01:17:54.030]  microbial redundant,
[01:17:54.030 --> 01:17:55.350]  I would say.
[01:17:55.390 --> 01:17:57.590]  And I think they both
[01:17:57.590 --> 01:17:59.030]  see different trees.
[01:18:00.150 --> 01:18:01.150]  Right.
[01:18:01.750 --> 01:18:02.990]  Kronja is
[01:18:04.430 --> 01:18:05.870]  to me, it's like the healing
[01:18:05.870 --> 01:18:06.830]  property.
[01:18:06.830 --> 01:18:08.430]  So, you know, you're putting out your
[01:18:08.430 --> 01:18:10.110]  microbial with the Neem
[01:18:10.110 --> 01:18:12.510]  the and trying to lower
[01:18:12.510 --> 01:18:13.670]  the microbial rate.
[01:18:13.670 --> 01:18:14.990]  But the Kronja is like
[01:18:15.990 --> 01:18:17.630]  it's a healer.
[01:18:17.630 --> 01:18:18.510]  Like, I don't know.
[01:18:18.510 --> 01:18:19.510]  It's like
[01:18:21.270 --> 01:18:22.630]  they work so well together.
[01:18:22.630 --> 01:18:23.630]  How do you spell it?
[01:18:24.110 --> 01:18:25.110]  K-A-R-A-N-J-A.
[01:18:27.750 --> 01:18:28.750]  I can't read.
[01:18:28.750 --> 01:18:30.710]  I've there's a whole
[01:18:30.710 --> 01:18:32.510]  the company that I get this from
[01:18:32.510 --> 01:18:34.630]  is called Enesma.
[01:18:34.630 --> 01:18:36.310]  I think is how you say it's a.
[01:18:36.310 --> 01:18:37.310]  Are they in Florida?
[01:18:39.070 --> 01:18:40.870]  No, I don't know.
[01:18:40.870 --> 01:18:41.870]  I don't.
[01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:44.430]  I think I heard.
[01:18:44.430 --> 01:18:45.430]  I think so.
[01:18:45.430 --> 01:18:46.430]  It's cool.
[01:18:46.430 --> 01:18:48.590]  Talking to somebody in Florida.
[01:18:48.590 --> 01:18:49.990]  They got a company.
[01:18:49.990 --> 01:18:51.390]  I think it's a company.
[01:18:51.390 --> 01:18:52.390]  I don't know.
[01:18:52.510 --> 01:18:53.270]  Company.
[01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:55.550]  I think that there's some Kronja
[01:18:55.550 --> 01:18:57.350]  rules or whatever the heck they are
[01:18:57.350 --> 01:18:58.350]  in Florida.
[01:18:59.470 --> 01:19:00.630]  Right.
[01:19:00.630 --> 01:19:01.510]  It may be.
[01:19:01.510 --> 01:19:03.150]  I can't remember.
[01:19:03.150 --> 01:19:04.150]  I have it somewhere.
[01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:06.270]  What do you know?
[01:19:07.550 --> 01:19:09.550]  But the Kronja
[01:19:09.550 --> 01:19:11.310]  and Neem together, like I've had,
[01:19:11.310 --> 01:19:13.910]  you know, like where you've had
[01:19:13.910 --> 01:19:15.670]  carosis of the leaf
[01:19:15.670 --> 01:19:17.270]  or cirrhosis of the leaf,
[01:19:17.270 --> 01:19:18.550]  like, you know, you don't have
[01:19:18.550 --> 01:19:20.950]  enough calcium or iron
[01:19:20.950 --> 01:19:22.990]  and you may have had a bug
[01:19:22.990 --> 01:19:25.270]  kind of chew on something or like
[01:19:25.270 --> 01:19:26.790]  even the end of the leaf
[01:19:26.790 --> 01:19:28.950]  starting to rot because of,
[01:19:28.950 --> 01:19:31.510]  you know, like calcium
[01:19:31.510 --> 01:19:33.310]  or nitrogen or, you know,
[01:19:33.310 --> 01:19:34.470]  a burn.
[01:19:34.470 --> 01:19:37.310]  And you can spray Kronja and Neem.
[01:19:37.310 --> 01:19:39.470]  And sometimes I've watched it
[01:19:39.470 --> 01:19:41.670]  heal a leaf like,
[01:19:41.670 --> 01:19:42.670]  you know,
[01:19:43.470 --> 01:19:45.350]  a leaf hopper chewed a hole
[01:19:45.350 --> 01:19:46.990]  in my leaf and there was a few holes
[01:19:46.990 --> 01:19:49.790]  and I sprayed it and it mutated
[01:19:49.830 --> 01:19:52.030]  itself like cellular
[01:19:52.030 --> 01:19:54.470]  back together, spraying Kronja
[01:19:54.470 --> 01:19:56.790]  and Neem. And I feel like
[01:19:56.790 --> 01:19:58.710]  one, you can't have one without
[01:19:58.710 --> 01:19:59.590]  the other.
[01:19:59.590 --> 01:20:01.350]  And that's a lot of people here
[01:20:01.350 --> 01:20:02.950]  of the product Neem,
[01:20:02.950 --> 01:20:04.230]  but they never hear about what
[01:20:04.230 --> 01:20:06.430]  Kronja is and build the soil.
[01:20:06.430 --> 01:20:08.230]  They never sell Kronja
[01:20:08.230 --> 01:20:08.430]  until today.
[01:20:08.430 --> 01:20:10.710]  They sell Kronja cakes
[01:20:10.710 --> 01:20:13.270]  and they say it's really,
[01:20:13.270 --> 01:20:15.670]  really beneficial to the soil.
[01:20:15.670 --> 01:20:17.990]  They when they sell their soil.
[01:20:17.990 --> 01:20:19.070]  So I got a basic,
[01:20:19.070 --> 01:20:20.630]  I got a basic Google search here
[01:20:20.630 --> 01:20:21.790]  if you guys want.
[01:20:21.790 --> 01:20:23.630]  There's a,
[01:20:23.630 --> 01:20:25.150]  I think going back to the guy
[01:20:25.150 --> 01:20:26.790]  that I was thinking about
[01:20:26.790 --> 01:20:29.150]  talking with in Florida and coastal,
[01:20:29.150 --> 01:20:30.390]  I don't know if this is what sparked
[01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:31.390]  you up, but
[01:20:32.590 --> 01:20:34.550]  I think that they would grow
[01:20:34.550 --> 01:20:36.390]  in these to try to help with
[01:20:36.390 --> 01:20:38.230]  whatever the problem is with the
[01:20:38.230 --> 01:20:39.830]  citrus fruits.
[01:20:39.830 --> 01:20:41.510]  I could be wrong, but that's kind
[01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:43.470]  of what I remember in that.
[01:20:44.670 --> 01:20:46.590]  It was a YouTube video and I
[01:20:46.590 --> 01:20:48.630]  can't remember what
[01:20:48.670 --> 01:20:50.110]  when I know what you're talking
[01:20:50.110 --> 01:20:51.190]  about. It was cool.
[01:20:51.190 --> 01:20:52.830]  And there was there was a bunch of
[01:20:54.230 --> 01:20:56.030]  a guy growing.
[01:20:56.030 --> 01:20:57.670]  I think it was Kronja.
[01:20:57.670 --> 01:20:58.910]  Yeah, it was Kronja.
[01:20:58.910 --> 01:21:00.910]  And they talk about they make a soil
[01:21:00.910 --> 01:21:02.710]  that they put the cakes in.
[01:21:02.710 --> 01:21:03.790]  They sell it.
[01:21:03.790 --> 01:21:05.750]  Was it the citrus fruit originally
[01:21:05.750 --> 01:21:06.750]  why they did it?
[01:21:07.750 --> 01:21:09.750]  Yes, because there's
[01:21:09.750 --> 01:21:11.590]  a problem with oranges right
[01:21:11.590 --> 01:21:14.350]  now and oranges have been
[01:21:14.350 --> 01:21:16.630]  some type of disease
[01:21:16.630 --> 01:21:18.470]  that they that's not it's not
[01:21:19.430 --> 01:21:22.230]  something green, something.
[01:21:22.230 --> 01:21:24.350]  That's why they wish they were
[01:21:24.350 --> 01:21:26.150]  just maybe extinct if we can't
[01:21:26.150 --> 01:21:27.390]  figure this out.
[01:21:27.390 --> 01:21:29.390]  Right. Is it mosaic disease
[01:21:29.390 --> 01:21:30.070]  or what?
[01:21:30.070 --> 01:21:32.430]  No, it's a it's a it's a greening.
[01:21:32.430 --> 01:21:34.510]  It makes the makes the oranges
[01:21:34.510 --> 01:21:35.750]  just stay green.
[01:21:35.750 --> 01:21:37.590]  And I don't know if
[01:21:37.590 --> 01:21:39.830]  never the truth is dying.
[01:21:39.830 --> 01:21:40.830]  Yeah.
[01:21:42.870 --> 01:21:44.470]  Yeah, I remember there's another
[01:21:44.470 --> 01:21:45.710]  disease that's been going around.
[01:21:45.710 --> 01:21:46.470]  Oh, crap.
[01:21:46.470 --> 01:21:48.350]  Yeah, that does.
[01:21:48.350 --> 01:21:50.110]  Yeah, it drags them down.
[01:21:50.110 --> 01:21:51.110]  Yeah.
[01:21:52.750 --> 01:21:54.470]  Yeah, so Google has been
[01:21:54.470 --> 01:21:56.790]  hitting Canada really bad, too.
[01:21:56.790 --> 01:21:58.070]  So here here's the Google,
[01:21:58.070 --> 01:21:59.990]  the definition of Kronja chemical
[01:21:59.990 --> 01:22:02.070]  properties of pest control.
[01:22:02.070 --> 01:22:03.430]  And this is what Google comes up
[01:22:03.430 --> 01:22:05.190]  with. Kronja oil has
[01:22:05.190 --> 01:22:06.990]  similar insecticidal properties to
[01:22:06.990 --> 01:22:08.910]  neem oil and acts against a number
[01:22:08.910 --> 01:22:11.230]  of insects, insects and other pests
[01:22:11.230 --> 01:22:13.070]  with the mild and versatile aroma.
[01:22:13.070 --> 01:22:15.590]  It acts as an
[01:22:15.590 --> 01:22:17.350]  aeris aeroside.
[01:22:17.390 --> 01:22:19.510]  So AC, A.R.
[01:22:19.510 --> 01:22:22.190]  ICID and insecticide
[01:22:22.190 --> 01:22:24.230]  Kronja oil is a known
[01:22:24.230 --> 01:22:26.630]  nitrification inhibitory
[01:22:26.630 --> 01:22:27.630]  properties.
[01:22:28.950 --> 01:22:30.870]  So like they're really like I haven't
[01:22:30.870 --> 01:22:32.910]  been like your basic Google searching,
[01:22:32.910 --> 01:22:35.110]  like I have been able to get
[01:22:35.110 --> 01:22:37.310]  a lot of information
[01:22:37.310 --> 01:22:39.310]  on exactly what the chemical
[01:22:39.310 --> 01:22:42.590]  constituencies are in it.
[01:22:42.590 --> 01:22:44.310]  But it's it's it's similar, like it's
[01:22:44.310 --> 01:22:46.790]  an oil based surfactant.
[01:22:46.790 --> 01:22:48.550]  It's an oil based that probably
[01:22:48.550 --> 01:22:50.510]  suffocates and is a neuro
[01:22:50.510 --> 01:22:52.150]  I think it's a nod to the
[01:22:52.150 --> 01:22:53.390]  seed or whatever.
[01:22:53.390 --> 01:22:55.270]  Probably pretty, pretty dang close
[01:22:55.270 --> 01:22:56.910]  to to neem oil as well.
[01:22:56.910 --> 01:22:58.550]  Yeah, but it doesn't make you
[01:22:58.550 --> 01:23:00.430]  anything like neem.
[01:23:00.430 --> 01:23:02.150]  Yeah, I hear it smells nice.
[01:23:02.150 --> 01:23:03.630]  It says it smells lovely.
[01:23:03.630 --> 01:23:04.790]  Yeah, it's lovely.
[01:23:04.790 --> 01:23:06.870]  My my partner that is in the
[01:23:06.870 --> 01:23:09.110]  grove with me, he is 100
[01:23:09.110 --> 01:23:10.590]  percent. He's like, I hate neem.
[01:23:10.590 --> 01:23:12.470]  That stuff stinks.
[01:23:12.470 --> 01:23:13.710]  And he's totally against it.
[01:23:13.710 --> 01:23:14.870]  But he's like, you can spray the
[01:23:14.870 --> 01:23:15.910]  Kronja and stuff.
[01:23:15.910 --> 01:23:16.830]  And I'm like, dude, I'm not
[01:23:16.830 --> 01:23:18.350]  spraying one without the other,
[01:23:18.350 --> 01:23:20.070]  you know, but like it clogs
[01:23:20.070 --> 01:23:21.630]  the stomata.
[01:23:21.630 --> 01:23:23.430]  It's an oil, you
[01:23:23.430 --> 01:23:26.350]  know, just like spraying sulfur.
[01:23:26.350 --> 01:23:28.630]  All that stuff is residual.
[01:23:28.630 --> 01:23:30.630]  I mean, I use a leaf polisher
[01:23:30.630 --> 01:23:32.150]  and I'll clean the leaf like I don't
[01:23:32.150 --> 01:23:34.190]  always like I'll get my three
[01:23:34.190 --> 01:23:35.430]  sprays in one week.
[01:23:35.430 --> 01:23:37.510]  I'll do my Monday spray,
[01:23:37.510 --> 01:23:39.510]  my Thursday spray and my Monday
[01:23:39.510 --> 01:23:41.390]  spray, you know, or whatever.
[01:23:41.390 --> 01:23:43.710]  And then I'm good for like a month.
[01:23:43.710 --> 01:23:45.230]  But at some point I need if it
[01:23:45.230 --> 01:23:47.230]  doesn't rain or
[01:23:47.230 --> 01:23:48.710]  I it needs to come off.
[01:23:48.710 --> 01:23:50.550]  I use Dr. Zimes.
[01:23:50.550 --> 01:23:52.510]  I think that's a really great soft
[01:23:52.510 --> 01:23:54.430]  product. It's a broad
[01:23:54.430 --> 01:23:56.510]  spectrum for
[01:23:56.510 --> 01:23:58.950]  bacterial and insecticide
[01:23:58.950 --> 01:24:00.590]  fungicide.
[01:24:00.590 --> 01:24:02.870]  It's just citric acid and yeast.
[01:24:02.870 --> 01:24:04.750]  I mean, I if I had the time,
[01:24:04.750 --> 01:24:05.670]  I'd make my own.
[01:24:05.670 --> 01:24:07.630]  You know, you could simply do it
[01:24:07.630 --> 01:24:09.470]  by taking some orange or lemon
[01:24:09.470 --> 01:24:11.710]  rinds and just fermenting
[01:24:11.710 --> 01:24:12.390]  them.
[01:24:12.390 --> 01:24:14.590]  That reminds me to check my dose
[01:24:14.630 --> 01:24:16.390]  of like I have like four days going
[01:24:16.390 --> 01:24:17.630]  right now and they're probably all
[01:24:17.630 --> 01:24:19.670]  ballooning out of their bowls.
[01:24:19.670 --> 01:24:20.190]  Nice.
[01:24:20.190 --> 01:24:21.190]  Wonderful.
[01:24:22.190 --> 01:24:23.950]  Inside the like.
[01:24:25.830 --> 01:24:27.670]  It's like you just
[01:24:27.670 --> 01:24:29.590]  you're just like trying
[01:24:29.590 --> 01:24:31.710]  to do the best you can
[01:24:31.710 --> 01:24:33.710]  with what you have.
[01:24:33.710 --> 01:24:35.670]  And it's like,
[01:24:35.670 --> 01:24:37.510]  fuck everybody else.
[01:24:37.510 --> 01:24:38.510]  Yeah, I mean,
[01:24:39.830 --> 01:24:40.830]  we and
[01:24:42.390 --> 01:24:43.390]  I did.
[01:24:44.070 --> 01:24:45.790]  I look at it as,
[01:24:45.790 --> 01:24:47.630]  you know, yeah, you got to do
[01:24:47.630 --> 01:24:49.630]  what you got to do with
[01:24:49.630 --> 01:24:50.630]  like that.
[01:24:51.590 --> 01:24:53.310]  And what you have,
[01:24:53.310 --> 01:24:55.190]  like we've all been given like
[01:24:55.190 --> 01:24:57.070]  a limited fucking kind
[01:24:57.070 --> 01:24:58.070]  of.
[01:25:00.310 --> 01:25:01.790]  The year within which we can
[01:25:01.790 --> 01:25:03.590]  fucking work within
[01:25:03.590 --> 01:25:06.150]  and we have to do what we can,
[01:25:06.150 --> 01:25:07.150]  you know.
[01:25:09.390 --> 01:25:11.230]  Yeah, if I was
[01:25:11.230 --> 01:25:13.070]  dealing with anything,
[01:25:13.070 --> 01:25:14.830]  I'd be a lot more aggressive than
[01:25:14.830 --> 01:25:15.550]  what I am.
[01:25:15.550 --> 01:25:16.630]  Don't misunderstand me.
[01:25:16.630 --> 01:25:18.670]  I'll spray if I need to.
[01:25:18.670 --> 01:25:20.710]  But I try to
[01:25:20.710 --> 01:25:22.510]  keep everything
[01:25:22.510 --> 01:25:24.790]  a little ecosystem as best I can
[01:25:24.790 --> 01:25:26.350]  and try to build on it.
[01:25:26.350 --> 01:25:27.790]  But if I have to go.
[01:25:29.190 --> 01:25:30.910]  Napalm, I have to go,
[01:25:30.910 --> 01:25:31.910]  what do you do with me?
[01:25:31.910 --> 01:25:33.590]  You know, it's the
[01:25:33.590 --> 01:25:35.790]  point of the stoppy chop.
[01:25:35.790 --> 01:25:36.790]  Right.
[01:25:37.190 --> 01:25:38.630]  I got lazy.
[01:25:38.630 --> 01:25:39.990]  Just stop doing shit.
[01:25:39.990 --> 01:25:40.910]  I'm just like, you know what?
[01:25:40.910 --> 01:25:42.870]  Fuck it. I'm just I'm too tired.
[01:25:43.390 --> 01:25:45.390]  Yeah, I got two kids
[01:25:45.390 --> 01:25:47.830]  and I'm just like,
[01:25:47.830 --> 01:25:49.790]  fuck, fuck it.
[01:25:49.790 --> 01:25:51.070]  And you know what I found?
[01:25:51.070 --> 01:25:52.070]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:25:53.150 --> 01:25:55.030]  Something comes in charge
[01:25:55.030 --> 01:25:56.590]  and something else comes around
[01:25:56.590 --> 01:25:57.590]  and fixes it.
[01:25:57.590 --> 01:25:58.870]  You know what I mean?
[01:25:58.870 --> 01:26:00.670]  Is there's enough diversity of plants
[01:26:00.670 --> 01:26:02.110]  and some fucking something will go
[01:26:02.110 --> 01:26:04.670]  right as long as you don't like
[01:26:04.670 --> 01:26:06.870]  plant some extra ones.
[01:26:06.870 --> 01:26:08.830]  Like, you know, like let a couple
[01:26:08.830 --> 01:26:09.990]  die. It'll happen.
[01:26:09.990 --> 01:26:10.790]  It's part of life.
[01:26:10.790 --> 01:26:12.710]  I can't I can't have as many
[01:26:12.710 --> 01:26:13.950]  plants as you let in.
[01:26:13.950 --> 01:26:16.270]  But yeah, I basically
[01:26:16.270 --> 01:26:18.270]  in the same way, I'm like, oh, fuck it.
[01:26:18.270 --> 01:26:20.270]  OK, screw it.
[01:26:20.270 --> 01:26:21.190]  Let him go.
[01:26:22.550 --> 01:26:23.710]  Just if I get that,
[01:26:23.710 --> 01:26:26.710]  then I'm going to Danny Tomlin.
[01:26:27.190 --> 01:26:29.110]  Can you or do you know what product
[01:26:29.110 --> 01:26:30.350]  you're using?
[01:26:30.350 --> 01:26:32.030]  Do you because you like I mean,
[01:26:32.030 --> 01:26:33.390]  in Canada, a common product
[01:26:33.390 --> 01:26:34.710]  that's a copper fungicide
[01:26:34.710 --> 01:26:36.670]  is like harvest miracle.
[01:26:36.670 --> 01:26:38.310]  And like, I mean, it's not.
[01:26:40.470 --> 01:26:42.070]  You know, if you got a situation
[01:26:42.070 --> 01:26:43.030]  that you need to make sure
[01:26:43.030 --> 01:26:45.230]  you're on top of, it's
[01:26:45.230 --> 01:26:47.670]  it's a it's a possibility to use that.
[01:26:47.670 --> 01:26:49.390]  I mean, I would wash your plants
[01:26:49.390 --> 01:26:51.310]  afterwards and I wouldn't do it after.
[01:26:51.310 --> 01:26:52.510]  I wouldn't do it, you know,
[01:26:52.510 --> 01:26:55.630]  three weeks before harvest.
[01:26:55.630 --> 01:26:57.430]  I would, you know, give your plants
[01:26:57.430 --> 01:26:58.750]  at least three weeks in between.
[01:26:58.750 --> 01:27:00.950]  But there's there's a lot lighter
[01:27:01.270 --> 01:27:02.590]  things that you can do
[01:27:02.590 --> 01:27:03.910]  that you can try and fight them back
[01:27:03.910 --> 01:27:05.590]  with. Like, I think one of the best
[01:27:05.590 --> 01:27:06.710]  suggestions I've ever heard
[01:27:06.710 --> 01:27:07.910]  and one thing that I try and do
[01:27:07.910 --> 01:27:10.350]  is that hydrogen peroxide,
[01:27:10.670 --> 01:27:12.990]  like just at a low, low percentage
[01:27:13.350 --> 01:27:15.590]  and then and then follow up with labs
[01:27:15.590 --> 01:27:17.310]  the following like after it dries,
[01:27:17.310 --> 01:27:19.230]  you know, like hit it, let it dry
[01:27:19.230 --> 01:27:20.190]  and then labs it.
[01:27:20.190 --> 01:27:21.710]  And then that way you just go
[01:27:21.990 --> 01:27:23.310]  kill all the bacteria,
[01:27:23.310 --> 01:27:24.750]  reload as much bacteria
[01:27:24.750 --> 01:27:25.950]  as you can as possible.
[01:27:26.910 --> 01:27:29.470]  Like this is this is something
[01:27:29.470 --> 01:27:30.790]  that I've also kind of concluded
[01:27:30.790 --> 01:27:32.590]  is that like there are plants
[01:27:32.590 --> 01:27:34.230]  to get moldy and there are plants
[01:27:34.230 --> 01:27:35.310]  that don't get moldy.
[01:27:36.190 --> 01:27:36.870]  You know what I mean?
[01:27:36.870 --> 01:27:38.510]  Like if you if you if you got
[01:27:38.510 --> 01:27:40.110]  your consistencies and your numbers
[01:27:40.110 --> 01:27:42.430]  down pat and there's mold showing up
[01:27:42.630 --> 01:27:44.350]  and like and there's not more
[01:27:44.350 --> 01:27:46.070]  and it's like one set of plants
[01:27:46.070 --> 01:27:47.350]  or one specific plant,
[01:27:47.910 --> 01:27:49.670]  all the other plants are totally fine.
[01:27:49.950 --> 01:27:51.190]  That's kind of probably
[01:27:51.190 --> 01:27:52.590]  a potentially bad plant.
[01:27:52.710 --> 01:27:54.310]  That's just not doing great.
[01:27:54.350 --> 01:27:56.430]  Like I'll just I'll call those
[01:27:56.430 --> 01:27:57.470]  like if I see three weeks
[01:27:57.470 --> 01:27:59.590]  and I see powdery mildew on something,
[01:27:59.590 --> 01:28:00.150]  I'll just call it
[01:28:00.710 --> 01:28:02.350]  and just like, fuck it, done.
[01:28:02.510 --> 01:28:03.510]  Like, why? Why?
[01:28:03.670 --> 01:28:04.310]  Why? Why? Why?
[01:28:04.310 --> 01:28:05.190]  I want a baby.
[01:28:06.110 --> 01:28:07.550]  Yeah, it's not happy there.
[01:28:08.070 --> 01:28:09.990]  The other ones are they need room.
[01:28:10.830 --> 01:28:11.870]  I'll give them that room.
[01:28:12.790 --> 01:28:13.350]  Why not?
[01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:19.790]  Yeah, powdery mildew is just a man,
[01:28:19.790 --> 01:28:22.990]  that's a hard one to deal with, I think.
[01:28:25.870 --> 01:28:27.110]  That thrips,
[01:28:27.710 --> 01:28:30.550]  you know, outside thrips is I don't
[01:28:30.550 --> 01:28:32.110]  I've never really had a problem
[01:28:32.110 --> 01:28:34.110]  with mites spraying the neem
[01:28:34.110 --> 01:28:35.750]  and the cronja, but I've always,
[01:28:36.190 --> 01:28:39.150]  you know, the the thrips and
[01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:41.790]  sometimes the powdery mildew
[01:28:41.790 --> 01:28:44.470]  strain dependent is just man,
[01:28:44.470 --> 01:28:47.190]  it's it could be a nightmare, you know.
[01:28:49.310 --> 01:28:51.550]  The there's a few products,
[01:28:51.550 --> 01:28:52.710]  you know, that are like
[01:28:54.950 --> 01:28:57.910]  peroxide based and stuff that works.
[01:28:57.910 --> 01:28:59.870]  I mean, I know some growers,
[01:28:59.870 --> 01:29:01.510]  they spray milk or
[01:29:02.470 --> 01:29:04.470]  some type of alkaline like.
[01:29:06.110 --> 01:29:09.190]  Go, go, go for it, brother, go for it.
[01:29:10.550 --> 01:29:12.390]  Am I am I interrupting, please?
[01:29:12.390 --> 01:29:13.990]  No, I don't.
[01:29:13.990 --> 01:29:14.790]  But it's OK.
[01:29:14.790 --> 01:29:15.950]  Am I cool?
[01:29:15.950 --> 01:29:17.670]  Nick, are you cool?
[01:29:17.670 --> 01:29:18.710]  You're cool.
[01:29:18.830 --> 01:29:20.310]  Yeah. OK, bro.
[01:29:21.670 --> 01:29:22.270]  Fucking.
[01:29:23.310 --> 01:29:26.790]  Just throw a shit ton of fucking damn
[01:29:27.390 --> 01:29:29.630]  perlite on the damn top of the damn
[01:29:29.630 --> 01:29:31.270]  fucking containers,
[01:29:31.270 --> 01:29:33.350]  like at least one inch,
[01:29:33.350 --> 01:29:35.070]  and it will fucking aspirate
[01:29:35.070 --> 01:29:36.870]  the shit out of the damn thrip.
[01:29:37.390 --> 01:29:38.790]  They will literally like
[01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:40.550]  try to go into them
[01:29:40.550 --> 01:29:42.630]  and it will fucking kill them.
[01:29:42.630 --> 01:29:44.390]  It will fucking kill the shit
[01:29:44.390 --> 01:29:46.030]  out of the damn thrips.
[01:29:46.030 --> 01:29:47.790]  There will be no more thrips
[01:29:47.790 --> 01:29:49.270]  after you do that.
[01:29:49.270 --> 01:29:52.070]  Like it kills the living crap
[01:29:52.070 --> 01:29:53.470]  out of those things.
[01:29:53.470 --> 01:29:55.470]  It's hard to do outside.
[01:29:55.470 --> 01:29:58.230]  Years ago, like when I was.
[01:29:59.030 --> 01:30:01.310]  Yeah, you get water wash off.
[01:30:01.350 --> 01:30:03.110]  Like I like I like perlite
[01:30:03.110 --> 01:30:05.110]  is as a smashdown for sure.
[01:30:05.110 --> 01:30:07.070]  Like it can be it can be handy,
[01:30:07.070 --> 01:30:07.910]  but I don't know.
[01:30:07.910 --> 01:30:09.670]  Like if that's you know what
[01:30:09.670 --> 01:30:11.790]  I ran into the other day is pirate bugs.
[01:30:11.790 --> 01:30:13.950]  After I found thrips two days later,
[01:30:13.950 --> 01:30:14.670]  it was like, oh, look,
[01:30:14.670 --> 01:30:15.830]  now I have a group of pirates
[01:30:15.830 --> 01:30:16.550]  outside.
[01:30:16.550 --> 01:30:17.990]  The rips is man.
[01:30:17.990 --> 01:30:20.190]  They got a 60 day lifespan.
[01:30:20.190 --> 01:30:22.150]  They thrive in the heat.
[01:30:22.150 --> 01:30:22.630]  I mean,
[01:30:23.830 --> 01:30:25.270]  they're just, you know,
[01:30:25.270 --> 01:30:26.550]  and they can be devouring.
[01:30:26.550 --> 01:30:27.910]  A lot of people don't
[01:30:27.910 --> 01:30:29.630]  like they just pick the leaf off
[01:30:29.630 --> 01:30:30.990]  and they're like, oh, that's fine.
[01:30:30.990 --> 01:30:32.230]  But I mean, when it comes
[01:30:32.230 --> 01:30:34.190]  to the finished product in the bud
[01:30:34.590 --> 01:30:36.510]  and you got all these holes in your bud
[01:30:36.510 --> 01:30:37.830]  and you're like, why in this bud
[01:30:37.830 --> 01:30:38.670]  form together?
[01:30:38.670 --> 01:30:40.830]  Well, yeah, that bud,
[01:30:40.830 --> 01:30:42.870]  you're picking off the whole, you know,
[01:30:43.110 --> 01:30:44.910]  and they're so fast, man.
[01:30:45.590 --> 01:30:46.550]  You try to get one
[01:30:46.550 --> 01:30:48.270]  and they run around stuck
[01:30:48.590 --> 01:30:50.190]  and then they fly off or something,
[01:30:50.190 --> 01:30:50.510]  you know?
[01:30:52.030 --> 01:30:52.350]  Yeah.
[01:30:53.110 --> 01:30:54.310]  Yeah, that's why I'm saying
[01:30:54.310 --> 01:30:56.550]  like you just throw a whole bunch
[01:30:56.550 --> 01:30:59.350]  of perlite down on the on the media.
[01:31:00.190 --> 01:31:03.310]  And so it did cost so much money outside.
[01:31:03.310 --> 01:31:06.190]  Like, you know, you'd be talking like
[01:31:06.910 --> 01:31:09.830]  100 cubic feet or more plus,
[01:31:09.950 --> 01:31:11.630]  you know, for your beds.
[01:31:12.750 --> 01:31:14.510]  That's kind of cost
[01:31:14.510 --> 01:31:15.710]  reductive there.
[01:31:16.110 --> 01:31:17.630]  And pumice is a better.
[01:31:17.870 --> 01:31:19.030]  I kind of work.
[01:31:19.310 --> 01:31:21.110]  I kind of work at that level.
[01:31:21.110 --> 01:31:21.990]  So I'm sorry.
[01:31:22.710 --> 01:31:26.030]  Yeah, that's that's where I am at.
[01:31:26.550 --> 01:31:28.750]  I like a home at a home size
[01:31:29.070 --> 01:31:30.510]  at the home size level.
[01:31:30.510 --> 01:31:32.270]  It can be an alternative that can
[01:31:32.270 --> 01:31:34.030]  that can get you some success
[01:31:34.030 --> 01:31:35.070]  in a challenging situation.
[01:31:35.070 --> 01:31:36.470]  Like I've seen people use it for thrips
[01:31:36.750 --> 01:31:38.030]  for fungus that's
[01:31:38.030 --> 01:31:39.350]  and have some success as well.
[01:31:39.350 --> 01:31:41.510]  Like it's not like the end all be all.
[01:31:41.510 --> 01:31:44.150]  But like I like every situation
[01:31:44.150 --> 01:31:45.230]  calls for something different.
[01:31:45.230 --> 01:31:45.470]  Right.
[01:31:45.590 --> 01:31:47.750]  Like I would do that in my pots.
[01:31:47.990 --> 01:31:48.350]  Yeah.
[01:31:48.350 --> 01:31:48.590]  Yeah.
[01:31:48.590 --> 01:31:49.390]  In my pots.
[01:31:49.390 --> 01:31:51.150]  That's perfect inside.
[01:31:51.150 --> 01:31:52.830]  Like bad.
[01:31:53.030 --> 01:31:54.310]  But outside, like
[01:31:54.670 --> 01:31:57.030]  it's going to wash and float away,
[01:31:57.590 --> 01:31:58.430]  you know,
[01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:01.070]  you know, it's just that
[01:32:01.150 --> 01:32:02.230]  that would be hard to
[01:32:02.990 --> 01:32:03.950]  that would be a hard one.
[01:32:04.950 --> 01:32:07.990]  But Danny, Danny says he's using
[01:32:07.990 --> 01:32:10.150]  Captain Jack's copper fungicide
[01:32:10.150 --> 01:32:12.630]  with bunnied and it's just four weeks
[01:32:12.630 --> 01:32:14.710]  in a veg and white powder on five of them.
[01:32:14.710 --> 01:32:16.190]  He said they had an execute company.
[01:32:17.310 --> 01:32:17.910]  What do you guys
[01:32:17.910 --> 01:32:20.110]  what would you guys do in this situation?
[01:32:20.110 --> 01:32:21.950]  I mean, like, yikes,
[01:32:22.430 --> 01:32:23.790]  if you got powdery mildew
[01:32:23.790 --> 01:32:25.470]  and they're still in a veg,
[01:32:25.550 --> 01:32:27.110]  are they like if they're really bushy,
[01:32:27.550 --> 01:32:28.910]  like clean them out,
[01:32:28.910 --> 01:32:30.190]  get a fan around there.
[01:32:30.190 --> 01:32:30.550]  I don't know.
[01:32:30.550 --> 01:32:31.790]  There's a lot of problems
[01:32:31.790 --> 01:32:32.590]  that could come into that.
[01:32:32.590 --> 01:32:33.070]  What do you think?
[01:32:34.630 --> 01:32:36.430]  Do you the the thing is,
[01:32:36.430 --> 01:32:38.310]  is do you want to stay organic?
[01:32:39.310 --> 01:32:41.110]  Or, you know, sometimes
[01:32:41.110 --> 01:32:42.750]  you got to bring out the big guns.
[01:32:42.750 --> 01:32:44.830]  I mean, commercially, especially,
[01:32:44.830 --> 01:32:46.350]  you've got to make it to market.
[01:32:46.350 --> 01:32:47.910]  You got thousands of dollars
[01:32:47.910 --> 01:32:49.110]  tied up in every run.
[01:32:49.110 --> 01:32:50.350]  I'm a broke farmer.
[01:32:50.550 --> 01:32:52.710]  You know, every dollar counts like
[01:32:53.550 --> 01:32:54.230]  at some point
[01:32:54.230 --> 01:32:55.390]  has got to make it to the market.
[01:32:55.390 --> 01:32:56.750]  And it's still got to be.
[01:32:57.630 --> 01:33:00.230]  Well, I mean, I'm at least humane enough
[01:33:00.230 --> 01:33:02.230]  to not put anything that's like
[01:33:03.030 --> 01:33:04.550]  that I wouldn't smoke
[01:33:04.550 --> 01:33:05.910]  personally on the market.
[01:33:06.190 --> 01:33:07.070]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:33:07.070 --> 01:33:08.230]  Like and
[01:33:10.190 --> 01:33:11.110]  you got to get it.
[01:33:11.910 --> 01:33:13.150]  I firmly believe
[01:33:13.150 --> 01:33:14.950]  I don't spray anything during flower.
[01:33:15.150 --> 01:33:16.670]  You know, if you got a problem,
[01:33:16.670 --> 01:33:18.710]  you need to address it before flower
[01:33:19.710 --> 01:33:20.990]  or don't put it in the flower
[01:33:20.990 --> 01:33:22.910]  until it's fixed.
[01:33:22.910 --> 01:33:25.230]  But I like sulfur.
[01:33:25.550 --> 01:33:27.710]  I think sulfur is a great micronized.
[01:33:27.710 --> 01:33:30.310]  Sulfur is a great product.
[01:33:30.350 --> 01:33:31.470]  You know, you can
[01:33:31.950 --> 01:33:33.710]  it's if you're not using oils,
[01:33:33.710 --> 01:33:35.030]  you can't spray the oil.
[01:33:35.070 --> 01:33:36.630]  You know, I like to use neem
[01:33:36.630 --> 01:33:39.430]  early in veg and just take care of my problems.
[01:33:39.430 --> 01:33:41.710]  But it's eventually
[01:33:41.990 --> 01:33:43.710]  it's too hot or something.
[01:33:43.710 --> 01:33:45.150]  You got to switch to sulfur.
[01:33:45.150 --> 01:33:45.550]  I don't know.
[01:33:45.550 --> 01:33:47.150]  But anyway, sulfur,
[01:33:47.150 --> 01:33:50.470]  you can run up to 30 grams per gallon.
[01:33:50.670 --> 01:33:52.750]  That's probably not recommended.
[01:33:52.790 --> 01:33:55.430]  That's too photo sensitive.
[01:33:55.430 --> 01:33:57.550]  It become photo toxic at that point.
[01:33:57.550 --> 01:34:01.430]  But I don't know, like a 15, 15 grams
[01:34:01.470 --> 01:34:04.070]  to one gallon spray sulfur
[01:34:04.550 --> 01:34:06.070]  and then back it off
[01:34:06.070 --> 01:34:07.990]  and do your three sprays one week
[01:34:08.590 --> 01:34:09.990]  and go to like,
[01:34:11.190 --> 01:34:13.830]  you know, maybe 10 and then five
[01:34:14.470 --> 01:34:16.230]  and your last spray be five
[01:34:16.230 --> 01:34:17.390]  because you're building up
[01:34:18.230 --> 01:34:19.950]  on the leaf and then you need to
[01:34:20.310 --> 01:34:22.750]  probably wash it off and get it like a mic
[01:34:23.830 --> 01:34:26.670]  good microbes on your leaf, you know, like
[01:34:28.150 --> 01:34:29.750]  those are bad microbes
[01:34:29.750 --> 01:34:31.670]  and hyphae growing on your leaf.
[01:34:31.710 --> 01:34:33.110]  You got to clean the hyphae.
[01:34:33.110 --> 01:34:35.150]  But sometimes it's embedded.
[01:34:35.430 --> 01:34:37.470]  Like I've had clones I've gotten from
[01:34:38.550 --> 01:34:41.470]  like places from California and stuff
[01:34:41.470 --> 01:34:43.670]  that were supposed to be like primo cuts
[01:34:43.670 --> 01:34:45.350]  and this and that and they come in.
[01:34:45.350 --> 01:34:47.910]  And that's why you got to isolate everything
[01:34:47.910 --> 01:34:49.870]  because they come in and they'll just be
[01:34:50.670 --> 01:34:53.630]  trashed with like root rot,
[01:34:53.870 --> 01:34:58.630]  like pithom or dark heart.
[01:35:00.350 --> 01:35:06.300]  But yeah, they'll be.
[01:35:07.260 --> 01:35:07.820]  I don't know.
[01:35:07.820 --> 01:35:10.580]  I use zero troll when anything comes in
[01:35:10.580 --> 01:35:12.780]  as a clone zero troll.
[01:35:12.780 --> 01:35:16.180]  And it's I can't really say it's 100 percent organic,
[01:35:16.180 --> 01:35:17.780]  but you can spray with it, too.
[01:35:19.860 --> 01:35:22.580]  It's peroxide, it's food grade peroxide,
[01:35:22.580 --> 01:35:24.900]  like 35 percent peroxide,
[01:35:24.900 --> 01:35:27.900]  and then it's got military grade vinegar in it.
[01:35:28.340 --> 01:35:32.060]  And I mean, vinegar is the strongest thing
[01:35:32.860 --> 01:35:35.220]  on the earth as an acid, you know?
[01:35:35.580 --> 01:35:37.460]  I mean, and she was good.
[01:35:38.140 --> 01:35:39.580]  It was glad to miss.
[01:35:39.580 --> 01:35:41.540]  Coot is in the audience.
[01:35:41.540 --> 01:35:42.260]  Cheers, brother.
[01:35:42.260 --> 01:35:43.260]  Hell yeah.
[01:35:43.260 --> 01:35:43.820]  Hell yeah.
[01:35:43.820 --> 01:35:45.380]  I'd love to meet this guy.
[01:35:45.380 --> 01:35:46.620]  He's a badass man.
[01:35:46.620 --> 01:35:48.540]  I mean, I listen to all your shit.
[01:35:49.540 --> 01:35:52.620]  Definitely learned a ton from everything you've spoken.
[01:35:53.060 --> 01:35:54.860]  Hell yeah. That's dope.
[01:35:54.860 --> 01:35:56.620]  Anyway, thank you.
[01:35:56.620 --> 01:35:57.980]  Thank you. Thank you.
[01:35:57.980 --> 01:36:00.420]  Yeah, he actually jumped in about the name
[01:36:00.460 --> 01:36:03.300]  and he said name is part of the mahogany tree family.
[01:36:03.620 --> 01:36:08.260]  Karanja is a legume and is cultivated in Florida.
[01:36:08.300 --> 01:36:11.780]  I visited several of the growing locations in central Florida.
[01:36:12.180 --> 01:36:13.420]  Yeah. Thanks for the jumping.
[01:36:13.420 --> 01:36:14.900]  King David jumped in as well.
[01:36:14.900 --> 01:36:17.300]  He may he did make a good point,
[01:36:17.900 --> 01:36:20.300]  you know, about using the sprays and,
[01:36:20.420 --> 01:36:23.700]  you know, hydrogen peroxide and balance pH would help your
[01:36:24.460 --> 01:36:26.540]  powdery mildew problems as good as there.
[01:36:26.540 --> 01:36:27.780]  But there is weakness.
[01:36:27.780 --> 01:36:30.820]  There are plants that are not that are super prone to it.
[01:36:30.820 --> 01:36:32.860]  And I'm just like, fuck it.
[01:36:34.180 --> 01:36:35.900]  Like I'm in the Pacific Northwest.
[01:36:35.900 --> 01:36:39.220]  I live like half a block from the ocean.
[01:36:39.740 --> 01:36:42.300]  If if you're going to get powdery mildew, you're going to get it.
[01:36:42.300 --> 01:36:44.900]  It's like there's so many huge trees covered in it.
[01:36:44.940 --> 01:36:49.420]  I don't think there's a there's a unless I like put an intake with CO2,
[01:36:49.740 --> 01:36:52.620]  I think would be the best way to like completely obliterate it.
[01:36:52.620 --> 01:36:53.900]  But I don't get powdery mildew.
[01:36:53.900 --> 01:36:56.940]  I get, you know, it can happen if I if things get out of balance.
[01:36:57.060 --> 01:37:00.540]  If my dehumidifier goes down overnight, I think that that fucking sucks.
[01:37:02.660 --> 01:37:04.540]  What are you trying to say there, Coastal?
[01:37:04.540 --> 01:37:05.860]  Open up your mic.
[01:37:06.580 --> 01:37:08.220]  Yeah, you're on mute.
[01:37:09.060 --> 01:37:11.060]  Yeah, I live right on the water.
[01:37:11.060 --> 01:37:15.340]  And like if I'm growing like a OG,
[01:37:15.700 --> 01:37:19.780]  like really a dense, like fucking really dense,
[01:37:19.780 --> 01:37:22.980]  fucking like Afghanis, you know, like train.
[01:37:23.100 --> 01:37:25.100]  Yeah, I'm not going to lie.
[01:37:25.100 --> 01:37:27.100]  What will happen is
[01:37:28.740 --> 01:37:34.380]  I will get like this fucking white mildew fucking shit like anywhere
[01:37:35.340 --> 01:37:39.540]  that the fucking plant has like an injury.
[01:37:40.100 --> 01:37:43.940]  Like if I if I did try to train it or something,
[01:37:44.420 --> 01:37:49.380]  it will always get like a like right where the fucking training is.
[01:37:49.380 --> 01:37:51.740]  It'll get a fucking white mildew injury.
[01:37:51.740 --> 01:37:55.300]  And I just have always known that.
[01:37:55.340 --> 01:37:59.740]  And it's just it's because it's just so humid for where we live.
[01:38:01.140 --> 01:38:05.060]  And I just
[01:38:06.540 --> 01:38:07.940]  I always hated that.
[01:38:07.940 --> 01:38:11.740]  And so that's why I've started to like I really just kind of
[01:38:12.780 --> 01:38:16.500]  lean towards hazes and I love hazes.
[01:38:16.500 --> 01:38:19.380]  So like I'm kind of more of a haze guy.
[01:38:19.860 --> 01:38:22.820]  And it's like, OK, I'm just going to grow these open,
[01:38:23.420 --> 01:38:27.620]  you know, kind of like where the buds like don't want to mold
[01:38:27.620 --> 01:38:30.580]  so much kind of strains.
[01:38:31.260 --> 01:38:35.340]  And yeah, I love cushions.
[01:38:35.340 --> 01:38:39.420]  But like, yeah, the hazes are a lot easier to grow
[01:38:39.420 --> 01:38:41.060]  when you're right on the water
[01:38:42.900 --> 01:38:47.500]  because the humidity issue is a fucking real bitch
[01:38:48.100 --> 01:38:50.100]  and it will kill you every time.
[01:38:50.180 --> 01:38:53.020]  I mean, the mold is real.
[01:38:54.180 --> 01:38:57.860]  So I just like kind of
[01:38:58.420 --> 01:39:01.180]  pulled myself to saying, OK, I just give up.
[01:39:06.630 --> 01:39:08.430]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:39:09.950 --> 01:39:13.030]  I did that.
[01:39:13.710 --> 01:39:15.230]  I was using
[01:39:16.430 --> 01:39:20.350]  I started using a product like with the hydrogen peroxide
[01:39:20.910 --> 01:39:25.190]  and just started dipping everything that I get, you know, or even.
[01:39:27.910 --> 01:39:31.510]  You know, they make I've been watching Zach, the grow guy.
[01:39:32.190 --> 01:39:35.750]  Biosafe is one of the.
[01:39:37.750 --> 01:39:42.110]  Industries leading IPM, integrated pest management system,
[01:39:42.270 --> 01:39:46.710]  and they have a few cleaning products
[01:39:46.710 --> 01:39:50.190]  that help you start clean and stay clean.
[01:39:50.630 --> 01:39:54.270]  And, you know, commercially, that's key.
[01:39:54.790 --> 01:39:57.470]  Was it biological?
[01:39:57.550 --> 01:40:02.830]  Well, it's just hydrogen peroxide and military grade vinegar
[01:40:02.830 --> 01:40:08.070]  for the zero troll, and then they have a product called oxy false.
[01:40:08.110 --> 01:40:10.630]  And it's together.
[01:40:11.430 --> 01:40:17.350]  It's like 81 percent or I mean, it'll kill over 81 percent.
[01:40:17.870 --> 01:40:19.470]  I guess. Well, give me two seconds.
[01:40:19.470 --> 01:40:20.990]  Pause. Fuck cookies.
[01:40:20.990 --> 01:40:22.590]  Will shit talk cookies here all day.
[01:40:22.590 --> 01:40:24.510]  King David. Somebody sorry.
[01:40:24.510 --> 01:40:27.990]  Somebody just said that that no one wants to talk about.
[01:40:27.990 --> 01:40:29.870]  About cookies in a bad manner.
[01:40:29.870 --> 01:40:32.030]  And fuck cookies.
[01:40:32.030 --> 01:40:36.230]  Every time I fucking say fuck cookies, I lose two fucking followers
[01:40:36.230 --> 01:40:38.270]  on Instagram and fuck cookies.
[01:40:38.270 --> 01:40:40.830]  So fuck cookies, fuck cookies, fuck cookies.
[01:40:41.870 --> 01:40:43.750]  I'm going to say like
[01:40:44.790 --> 01:40:47.830]  I hadn't I hadn't ever seen good cookies.
[01:40:47.830 --> 01:40:53.310]  We'd I we have a lemonade here and I go to dispose, dude.
[01:40:53.310 --> 01:40:56.750]  I ain't that snobby of a girl, but I'm pretty fucking snobby.
[01:40:56.750 --> 01:41:00.310]  I don't smoke other people's weed, but I'll go try some people shit out
[01:41:00.310 --> 01:41:04.710]  like that people talk up and they're like, yeah, man, that was really good.
[01:41:04.710 --> 01:41:07.190]  And I mean, I'll go I'll buy some whatever.
[01:41:07.510 --> 01:41:09.470]  And I went and I bought some.
[01:41:10.070 --> 01:41:12.790]  I had a couple of seeds in my weed that pissed me off.
[01:41:13.150 --> 01:41:15.990]  But, you know, you're buying primo weed.
[01:41:16.150 --> 01:41:19.310]  You spend $20 a gram and you get two fucking seeds.
[01:41:19.310 --> 01:41:21.310]  Well, dude, I know how much seeds weigh.
[01:41:21.870 --> 01:41:23.190]  That's bullshit.
[01:41:23.190 --> 01:41:26.950]  Anyway, but man, I that
[01:41:27.670 --> 01:41:30.830]  the great the thing about cookies is is.
[01:41:32.790 --> 01:41:35.750]  Their branding is so remarkably great
[01:41:35.750 --> 01:41:39.270]  that they can get rappers to talk about their weed
[01:41:39.510 --> 01:41:41.990]  and their strains and their fucking music.
[01:41:42.310 --> 01:41:43.870]  You know, we're doing right now.
[01:41:43.910 --> 01:41:45.550]  You know, we're doing right now.
[01:41:45.550 --> 01:41:47.790]  We're plugging cookies by talking about them.
[01:41:47.990 --> 01:41:49.710]  I know. I know.
[01:41:49.710 --> 01:41:52.230]  It's like stop giving the maritime Nick.
[01:41:52.310 --> 01:41:54.870]  Stop it. You're doing it right now.
[01:41:54.870 --> 01:41:55.750]  You're doing it.
[01:41:55.750 --> 01:41:57.670]  Their weed sucks.
[01:41:58.030 --> 01:41:59.590]  Their branding's.
[01:41:59.910 --> 01:42:01.990]  Well, OK, fine.
[01:42:01.990 --> 01:42:05.750]  Anyway, back to my oxyfos zero troll talk.
[01:42:06.070 --> 01:42:10.030]  If you use oxyfos and zero troll on your mother's
[01:42:10.350 --> 01:42:13.150]  about a day or two before you take cuts,
[01:42:13.470 --> 01:42:19.470]  it reduces the systemic response of any type of powdery mildew fungicide
[01:42:21.110 --> 01:42:24.910]  for us for 21 days almost,
[01:42:25.790 --> 01:42:29.510]  you know, and when you're doing it in domes and you're not using cloners,
[01:42:29.750 --> 01:42:33.750]  you can get, you know, downy mildew or powdery mildew
[01:42:33.750 --> 01:42:36.270]  just trying to get clones to root.
[01:42:36.550 --> 01:42:40.430]  And I've all I've been using that product for about a year
[01:42:41.110 --> 01:42:43.910]  just on my mother's to take my cuts.
[01:42:43.910 --> 01:42:47.430]  And it's really lowered the powdery mildew rate between that.
[01:42:47.790 --> 01:42:51.950]  And if I have a problem in the in the field,
[01:42:53.150 --> 01:42:55.150]  those are my big guns, man.
[01:42:55.150 --> 01:42:57.430]  I'll go out. I'll use the zero troll.
[01:42:57.750 --> 01:43:01.550]  It's a wipes it clean, you know, but if it's embedded in the leaf,
[01:43:01.550 --> 01:43:04.190]  you've got to keep fighting it until it dries out.
[01:43:04.470 --> 01:43:08.350]  And then when you use it together, the oxyfos and zero troll,
[01:43:08.550 --> 01:43:10.070]  it's like a flu shot.
[01:43:10.070 --> 01:43:12.990]  You're good for 21 days, you know, like, but
[01:43:14.270 --> 01:43:16.630]  you got to you got to start with it.
[01:43:16.630 --> 01:43:19.950]  You can't just think, oh, I'm going to go into the this
[01:43:19.950 --> 01:43:22.430]  and I'm going to spray that and it's going to be gone.
[01:43:22.430 --> 01:43:24.670]  Like, that's not how these things work.
[01:43:24.710 --> 01:43:27.670]  You know, like it's a there's a reason why you had it.
[01:43:27.670 --> 01:43:29.070]  It's because you didn't keep up with it.
[01:43:30.950 --> 01:43:34.310]  And I mean, but yeah, the oxyfos zero troll,
[01:43:34.590 --> 01:43:37.750]  I believe is a great product if you're really going to
[01:43:38.470 --> 01:43:42.950]  not stay 100 percent organic and you need to get something done
[01:43:42.950 --> 01:43:46.590]  because you're about to go into flower or something like that.
[01:43:46.630 --> 01:43:50.030]  You know, outdoors, it's not like you can flip this.
[01:43:53.030 --> 01:43:56.070]  Tell you when it's going to start flowering, you know,
[01:43:56.870 --> 01:43:58.990]  sometimes you're like, oh, shit, it's flowering
[01:43:59.430 --> 01:44:02.350]  and I still have a problem or on this one plant.
[01:44:02.390 --> 01:44:04.750]  Are you going to cut the plant down or are you going to fix your problem?
[01:44:04.990 --> 01:44:09.350]  I mean, you know, you're only as good as your fix,
[01:44:10.350 --> 01:44:15.790]  you know, I mean, I'm a carpenter and I'm I mess shit up all the fucking time.
[01:44:15.790 --> 01:44:21.310]  I'm a plumber. I say the exact same thing, but it's how good can you fix your fuck up?
[01:44:21.510 --> 01:44:25.070]  Because that's the difference between an amateur and a professional.
[01:44:25.910 --> 01:44:29.670]  Right. And, you know, if you're I believe I believe
[01:44:29.710 --> 01:44:30.670]  all the other
[01:44:30.670 --> 01:44:34.870]  you, you fucking multiple shit out that way.
[01:44:35.750 --> 01:44:40.710]  You need a few minutes to finish that.
[01:44:48.040 --> 01:44:50.400]  What's up, Coastal? Go ahead.
[01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:53.320]  Oh yeah.
[01:44:53.880 --> 01:44:58.720]  Growing weed is just basically fucking up exactly that.
[01:44:58.760 --> 01:45:03.800]  It's fucking up and learning from your screw ups and.
[01:45:04.880 --> 01:45:10.840]  The more you fuck up, the more you learn what not to do.
[01:45:10.920 --> 01:45:12.600]  It's all it is.
[01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:16.200]  People like think, oh, you're like so good at this or that.
[01:45:16.200 --> 01:45:21.120]  That no, it's after years and years and years of messing up.
[01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:25.320]  That's when you learn how to do it correctly.
[01:45:25.520 --> 01:45:27.800]  And then you learn this simple.
[01:45:27.800 --> 01:45:32.360]  And then that's when you finally are like, oh, wait, I could just do this really simply.
[01:45:32.760 --> 01:45:36.040]  And it's really easy and all this shit.
[01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:42.240]  But like it takes an eternity to get to that point because you just
[01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:48.880]  you spend your whole life thinking, oh, well, I watch these high times things,
[01:45:48.880 --> 01:45:52.960]  especially back in the day with all of us when we look at the high time stuff
[01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:54.000]  and all that.
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:58.080]  And it looks like, you know, there was this complicated stuff
[01:45:58.080 --> 01:46:00.440]  and it was like, no, it's not that complicated.
[01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:05.040]  And now you see like with, you know, FCP and all these people,
[01:46:05.600 --> 01:46:07.880]  everything is extremely simple.
[01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:13.280]  And life is really like actually easy to do this stuff.
[01:46:13.280 --> 01:46:18.640]  And I just. I really, really,
[01:46:18.640 --> 01:46:22.800]  really love this whole fucking channel and like what we're doing
[01:46:22.800 --> 01:46:25.280]  and like what we're supporting and.
[01:46:25.280 --> 01:46:34.240]  And. Yeah, I just I hate like the the the the the big,
[01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:38.560]  you know, companies that are trying to make money off this shit and.
[01:46:39.400 --> 01:46:41.360]  Yeah, the high. Yeah.
[01:46:43.200 --> 01:46:44.200]  You know what? Yeah.
[01:46:44.200 --> 01:46:46.000]  What happened?
[01:46:46.920 --> 01:46:52.960]  Like, like, you know, you see a girl and they call it or puke
[01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:57.720]  and, you know, like there's just too much trash out there.
[01:46:57.760 --> 01:46:59.280]  It's hard to.
[01:46:59.480 --> 01:47:04.320]  It's actually it upsets me, you know, the all of it,
[01:47:04.360 --> 01:47:08.320]  like when I used to harvest weed, we would harvest weed and people
[01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:10.360]  would gather friends, family and.
[01:47:11.920 --> 01:47:16.560]  And we would have fun and have a big cookout and, you know, smoke.
[01:47:17.920 --> 01:47:19.040]  Have a great time.
[01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:21.800]  And now it's kind of I don't know.
[01:47:22.520 --> 01:47:23.720]  It's not the same.
[01:47:23.720 --> 01:47:28.820]  It's just not the same, man.
[01:47:29.420 --> 01:47:30.460]  It's not.
[01:47:30.460 --> 01:47:32.580]  You know, it's in it.
[01:47:32.580 --> 01:47:34.460]  I think you're both sitting on a couple of really good points.
[01:47:34.460 --> 01:47:37.020]  Just fuck a we just fuck around and have fun in life.
[01:47:38.700 --> 01:47:40.060]  One hundred.
[01:47:40.060 --> 01:47:42.620]  And be support and surround yourself with awesome people.
[01:47:42.620 --> 01:47:44.020]  We got amazing people in the audience.
[01:47:44.020 --> 01:47:45.980]  We got amazing people here.
[01:47:45.980 --> 01:47:47.540]  We're short, Mr. Trees.
[01:47:47.540 --> 01:47:50.980]  But that's OK, because we got to look at all the awesome, amazing flowers today,
[01:47:50.980 --> 01:47:53.220]  which has been pretty, pretty, pretty epic and fun.
[01:47:53.940 --> 01:47:56.260]  Um, you got the pics?
[01:47:57.380 --> 01:48:01.260]  Yeah, I do. Do you want to do you want to jump in and have a little bit of a look at
[01:48:01.260 --> 01:48:02.940]  it and let me see if I can bring it back here.
[01:48:02.940 --> 01:48:05.580]  I mean, yeah, I really want to smoke it.
[01:48:05.580 --> 01:48:06.620]  It's just not ready yet.
[01:48:08.380 --> 01:48:09.220]  How you have been.
[01:48:10.260 --> 01:48:11.660]  OK, let me see here, let me see.
[01:48:11.660 --> 01:48:13.580]  I mean, I mean, is shit.
[01:48:13.580 --> 01:48:19.100]  Let me remove this and eliminate the screen share and then redo the screen share
[01:48:19.460 --> 01:48:20.660]  and then do this thing.
[01:48:20.660 --> 01:48:23.060]  But this is this has actually been.
[01:48:23.100 --> 01:48:25.780]  I wanted to. Yeah, we'll do you first.
[01:48:25.780 --> 01:48:26.340]  Where are you?
[01:48:28.700 --> 01:48:31.300]  Why is my Instagram not showing properly?
[01:48:35.260 --> 01:48:36.340]  There we go.
[01:48:36.340 --> 01:48:38.260]  I'm glad you know how to do all this stuff.
[01:48:38.260 --> 01:48:40.060]  I'm so computer illiterate.
[01:48:40.060 --> 01:48:41.060]  It's ridiculous.
[01:48:41.060 --> 01:48:46.020]  I'm like this middle aged man growing up in like this tech society.
[01:48:46.220 --> 01:48:48.980]  And I just want to be off the fucking grid almost.
[01:48:49.220 --> 01:48:51.980]  All right. Well, we look at that, brother.
[01:48:51.980 --> 01:48:55.980]  So, you know, this is the pan Kandahar cross.
[01:48:57.460 --> 01:49:02.020]  I believe that's the last one that I sent you.
[01:49:03.540 --> 01:49:05.700]  That was the chunky monkey one.
[01:49:05.740 --> 01:49:07.420]  You're 100 percent correct.
[01:49:07.420 --> 01:49:08.460]  It's the last one.
[01:49:08.460 --> 01:49:09.420]  And you know what?
[01:49:09.420 --> 01:49:12.620]  If I if I can say this because we were looking earlier in the show,
[01:49:12.780 --> 01:49:15.060]  we got a lot of comparative shape here.
[01:49:15.260 --> 01:49:20.380]  A like yours is yours has that one phenotype of mine
[01:49:20.380 --> 01:49:21.980]  had a lot more of this style of growth.
[01:49:21.980 --> 01:49:25.420]  You got a lot thinner leaf style, but the the budding shape,
[01:49:25.420 --> 01:49:28.900]  the calyx shape and the volume per leaf is very similar.
[01:49:29.300 --> 01:49:33.740]  Yeah, the the the Brax to leaf ratio is really.
[01:49:33.980 --> 01:49:37.180]  I mean, there's a lot of Braque and not a lot of leaf, you know.
[01:49:38.060 --> 01:49:40.420]  It's it's a really.
[01:49:40.420 --> 01:49:42.740]  I mean, it's chunky, it's solid, man.
[01:49:42.740 --> 01:49:46.420]  I even thought mites, you know, I gave it to a friend of mine
[01:49:46.420 --> 01:49:49.380]  because we do actually is my partner.
[01:49:49.380 --> 01:49:52.700]  And, you know, he's just he just waters it.
[01:49:53.220 --> 01:49:55.540]  And but I gave him to him clean.
[01:49:55.540 --> 01:49:58.140]  Somehow they got mites and I was like, well, we're smoking it.
[01:49:58.140 --> 01:49:59.860]  So we're not spraying it with nothing.
[01:49:59.860 --> 01:50:04.380]  And it's still it's chunky, solid.
[01:50:04.980 --> 01:50:07.860]  It didn't have quite the nose that this one had.
[01:50:07.900 --> 01:50:10.500]  This one was the
[01:50:10.500 --> 01:50:12.460]  it was number seven for me.
[01:50:12.460 --> 01:50:15.620]  And that one's super sparkly.
[01:50:15.940 --> 01:50:18.180]  It had a like a
[01:50:19.300 --> 01:50:22.540]  orange peel skunk smell.
[01:50:22.820 --> 01:50:25.900]  It was really it was really nice, actually.
[01:50:29.780 --> 01:50:33.020]  Did you grow just the Pam ever?
[01:50:33.020 --> 01:50:36.060]  Yeah. Have I grown just Pam?
[01:50:36.300 --> 01:50:38.500]  Yeah. No, I haven't.
[01:50:38.500 --> 01:50:42.340]  I was just wondering if you noticed any that is similar to just the Pam.
[01:50:43.380 --> 01:50:44.980]  No, I've never grown before.
[01:50:44.980 --> 01:50:47.140]  I've only heard it talked about, you know.
[01:50:48.380 --> 01:50:53.420]  And I feel like I pulled these down at like 11 weeks, right?
[01:50:53.460 --> 01:50:56.420]  There was like ten and a half, 11 weeks, somewhere in there.
[01:50:56.820 --> 01:50:59.900]  And some of them were just
[01:51:00.580 --> 01:51:04.580]  they're still not done like they probably could have went 13 weeks.
[01:51:05.260 --> 01:51:08.820]  I just think that seemed like they took a long time to induce flower.
[01:51:09.740 --> 01:51:12.140]  Yeah. Yeah.
[01:51:12.140 --> 01:51:14.580]  And some of them.
[01:51:14.580 --> 01:51:16.580]  Yeah, this one particularly.
[01:51:18.220 --> 01:51:23.780]  It was the prettiest vino in the room, like you, just the plant wise and everything.
[01:51:23.780 --> 01:51:25.740]  And then it flowered.
[01:51:25.740 --> 01:51:28.660]  And look at this thing is now.
[01:51:28.660 --> 01:51:30.820]  Are they all the exact same age in all these pictures?
[01:51:31.060 --> 01:51:32.460]  Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah.
[01:51:32.460 --> 01:51:35.700]  But I did take cuts and I'm going to try to run some outside,
[01:51:35.780 --> 01:51:40.700]  you know, little five gallon pots or something when it cools back down.
[01:51:43.780 --> 01:51:46.300]  Yeah, that one ended up it's not that pretty,
[01:51:46.980 --> 01:51:48.860]  but it's got a garbage.
[01:51:48.860 --> 01:51:53.900]  And I was the one that was like the it had a really great nose to it, though.
[01:51:53.900 --> 01:51:58.100]  You know, it was like that rotten trash can smell.
[01:51:58.740 --> 01:52:03.500]  And this one has that that funk odor to it as well.
[01:52:03.500 --> 01:52:05.100]  It's it's pretty funky.
[01:52:05.100 --> 01:52:06.820]  It's got some.
[01:52:07.700 --> 01:52:11.860]  Like maybe some garbage turps with some gas, you know, it's.
[01:52:12.860 --> 01:52:18.140]  There was only one of them that that was like citrusy smelling,
[01:52:18.140 --> 01:52:21.020]  and that was like really Pam,
[01:52:21.020 --> 01:52:24.140]  like a real Pam looking, and I think it's the next picture.
[01:52:26.620 --> 01:52:28.740]  That was even. Yeah.
[01:52:28.740 --> 01:52:30.300]  Yeah. That's the same plant.
[01:52:30.300 --> 01:52:33.580]  OK, that's the one that smells all citrusy.
[01:52:38.970 --> 01:52:41.970]  And then I showed you a picture of my indoor.
[01:52:42.010 --> 01:52:44.690]  Like it's small, but
[01:52:44.690 --> 01:52:46.770]  I don't know if you got it.
[01:52:47.010 --> 01:52:54.100]  Now, after all that.
[01:52:54.100 --> 01:52:55.900]  No video.
[01:52:58.310 --> 01:53:00.230]  I don't see here, buddy.
[01:53:00.230 --> 01:53:01.910]  OK, well, I probably didn't love it.
[01:53:01.910 --> 01:53:04.630]  We're on doing all these things off the phone.
[01:53:04.950 --> 01:53:06.070]  It's cool.
[01:53:06.230 --> 01:53:08.190]  But yeah, it's it's really unique.
[01:53:08.190 --> 01:53:10.390]  The plant had a great structure.
[01:53:12.270 --> 01:53:14.510]  You know, the leaves were really big.
[01:53:14.550 --> 01:53:18.150]  I really liked the big predominant leaves that are really
[01:53:20.750 --> 01:53:24.830]  the serious, the seriation on the leaves are real predominant.
[01:53:24.830 --> 01:53:30.190]  You know, I had that one, though, that was really finicky
[01:53:30.870 --> 01:53:35.190]  and it looked like it was like a nitrate deficient the whole time.
[01:53:35.470 --> 01:53:38.070]  It called never stopped.
[01:53:38.710 --> 01:53:40.350]  I just kind of chunk that one.
[01:53:40.350 --> 01:53:43.630]  For me, it's uniformity.
[01:53:43.630 --> 01:53:47.190]  And I think I got my two Fino's and my mail that I'm going to use
[01:53:47.190 --> 01:53:51.350]  to make an F2 of it and make and cast a bunch of seeds.
[01:53:51.350 --> 01:53:53.390]  And then I'm going to give some back to Mr.
[01:53:53.390 --> 01:53:56.230]  Trees. And I have
[01:53:57.750 --> 01:54:00.510]  a few other things I want to
[01:54:01.470 --> 01:54:02.830]  maybe cross to it.
[01:54:02.830 --> 01:54:07.710]  I actually got a clock in this cute cross seed.
[01:54:07.710 --> 01:54:13.510]  It was so it's called one times blue oxen.
[01:54:13.790 --> 01:54:15.070]  It's from Swami.
[01:54:15.070 --> 01:54:18.270]  It was just a 2022 seed selection.
[01:54:20.270 --> 01:54:23.830]  And I really want to try clocking this kids,
[01:54:24.190 --> 01:54:28.670]  the one strain, because I'm all about the time, man.
[01:54:28.670 --> 01:54:31.470]  I I've heard so many stories about it.
[01:54:32.350 --> 01:54:37.270]  And I feel like the real the real tie was like.
[01:54:38.750 --> 01:54:41.150]  That was the shit, man.
[01:54:41.150 --> 01:54:45.910]  I mean, it may not have been pretty, but the high was just a bit phenomenal.
[01:54:48.190 --> 01:54:50.430]  I got the kind of harm move red here.
[01:54:50.790 --> 01:54:52.750]  This one was the choice, Fino of them.
[01:54:54.430 --> 01:54:56.110]  And I snapped earlier, I did a little bit of.
[01:54:57.310 --> 01:54:59.150]  A picture taken.
[01:54:59.150 --> 01:55:01.150]  What kind of lights are those?
[01:55:01.150 --> 01:55:02.830]  These are my new ones from.
[01:55:05.110 --> 01:55:07.270]  They're from Greenham, Canada.
[01:55:07.630 --> 01:55:10.870]  Yeah, so I can fuck around, I can change their spectrum,
[01:55:10.870 --> 01:55:12.350]  I can do whatever I want with them.
[01:55:12.350 --> 01:55:14.950]  They're they're they're they're super powerful.
[01:55:16.310 --> 01:55:18.990]  They're a little bit overpowered for the space that I have.
[01:55:19.470 --> 01:55:21.270]  But I got the controller.
[01:55:21.270 --> 01:55:23.190]  It's kind of like in the back there. It's the white one.
[01:55:24.070 --> 01:55:24.670]  You can't see it.
[01:55:24.670 --> 01:55:26.270]  I see it on the angles again.
[01:55:26.270 --> 01:55:27.270]  I remember that.
[01:55:27.270 --> 01:55:30.750]  Please, please, please.
[01:55:30.750 --> 01:55:32.270]  I'm going to go back to the camera.
[01:55:32.270 --> 01:55:33.270]  I'm going to go back to the camera.
[01:55:33.270 --> 01:55:34.270]  I'm going to go back to the camera.
[01:55:34.270 --> 01:55:35.270]  I'm going to go back to the camera.
[01:55:35.270 --> 01:55:36.270]  I'm going to go back to the camera.
[01:55:36.670 --> 01:55:43.350]  Please, I guess, just like I don't know, teach me on these lights
[01:55:43.350 --> 01:55:50.750]  because as you know, I'm trying to look into looking into
[01:55:51.190 --> 01:55:56.150]  I'm looking at it like some really expensive LED lights.
[01:55:56.150 --> 01:56:02.350]  And I was looking into them and then also the first lights
[01:56:02.630 --> 01:56:05.750]  and a few of the other ones.
[01:56:05.750 --> 01:56:10.670]  But we're looking into like buying a whole bunch of.
[01:56:11.750 --> 01:56:16.950]  Yeah, we're probably going to be looking at at least one or two at first
[01:56:16.950 --> 01:56:19.990]  and then like at least four probably later.
[01:56:19.990 --> 01:56:24.870]  But tell me everything you know about these things
[01:56:24.870 --> 01:56:29.950]  because any info you can give is just gold.
[01:56:30.950 --> 01:56:31.950]  Nice.
[01:56:31.950 --> 01:56:33.750]  I just got to play with them.
[01:56:33.750 --> 01:56:35.950]  We've just we just set them up a little while ago.
[01:56:35.950 --> 01:56:39.550]  So I've only run it run through like I haven't even had a full round
[01:56:39.550 --> 01:56:41.350]  go through and flower them yet.
[01:56:41.350 --> 01:56:42.150]  Yeah, buddy.
[01:56:42.150 --> 01:56:43.430]  Yeah. And that gorgeous.
[01:56:43.430 --> 01:56:44.630]  That's beautiful.
[01:56:44.630 --> 01:56:46.350]  Isn't it nice?
[01:56:46.950 --> 01:56:49.750]  Somebody told me that the buds were small and that I underfed it
[01:56:49.750 --> 01:56:52.350]  and then I fucked it up and on on Facebook and I'm like,
[01:56:52.350 --> 01:56:56.950]  I don't know if you can just make that call from this photo.
[01:56:56.950 --> 01:56:57.950]  Straight.
[01:56:58.150 --> 01:56:59.350]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:56:59.350 --> 01:57:01.150]  And like I like I don't know.
[01:57:01.150 --> 01:57:03.950]  Like and then he's like, I'm like, OK, buddy.
[01:57:03.950 --> 01:57:05.150]  Sure. I don't know.
[01:57:05.150 --> 01:57:06.150]  Yeah, whatever.
[01:57:06.150 --> 01:57:08.750]  And he's like, well, you're a know it all.
[01:57:08.750 --> 01:57:09.550]  Blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:57:09.550 --> 01:57:12.950]  And my response is like, did you did you know that?
[01:57:12.950 --> 01:57:17.350]  Like, like I all I did was show a picture and you give me all this input
[01:57:17.350 --> 01:57:19.950]  and I'm like, I didn't like that.
[01:57:19.950 --> 01:57:22.950]  When no one all person type of like, how the fuck does that work?
[01:57:22.950 --> 01:57:24.350]  I'm really confused right now.
[01:57:24.350 --> 01:57:25.950]  I'm like, right.
[01:57:25.950 --> 01:57:28.150]  Still this point, I think it's beautiful.
[01:57:28.150 --> 01:57:32.150]  I figure if you don't have anything nice to say, don't fucking say it at all.
[01:57:32.150 --> 01:57:33.550]  Exactly.
[01:57:33.550 --> 01:57:34.750]  You know, there you go.
[01:57:34.750 --> 01:57:39.150]  That one that one guy raised by.
[01:57:39.150 --> 01:57:42.350]  Do those are pretty, you know, I know.
[01:57:42.350 --> 01:57:46.550]  I only see on the same pictures and it's all about the temperature variation.
[01:57:46.550 --> 01:57:52.350]  You know, you go into that cow mag lockout and it's unless you're doing a full year
[01:57:52.350 --> 01:57:58.150]  spray for your cow and your mag, it you got to run a hotter temperatures.
[01:57:58.150 --> 01:58:03.550]  The room's got to be a little warmer than if you run like a HPS or CMH,
[01:58:03.550 --> 01:58:07.550]  you know, like you want to be in the 80s.
[01:58:07.550 --> 01:58:17.150]  Yeah, I run like 28 high 24 low during day and then 21 21 low 22 high at night.
[01:58:17.150 --> 01:58:19.350]  I got to get my this summer.
[01:58:19.350 --> 01:58:21.350]  My my my translator open.
[01:58:21.350 --> 01:58:24.550]  We're talking to each other with the Celsius.
[01:58:24.550 --> 01:58:25.950]  Sorry, I don't know.
[01:58:25.950 --> 01:58:32.150]  That's the biggest thing in the garden here is we're rocking like a hundred and five degree temperatures outside
[01:58:32.150 --> 01:58:42.750]  and like a hundred and sixteen degree heat index like, you know, the soil once it gets above the soil temperature gets above 85.
[01:58:42.750 --> 01:58:46.050]  You go into a calcium magnesium lockout,
[01:58:46.050 --> 01:58:49.550]  you know, you're the biologicals aren't really doing their work.
[01:58:49.550 --> 01:58:54.550]  The microbes aren't doing their work because they're it's it's too hot to work.
[01:58:54.550 --> 01:59:01.050]  Yeah, and so like, you know, that's why mulching so important and and with the LEDs,
[01:59:01.050 --> 01:59:05.350]  you know, it's it's cool. There's no heat.
[01:59:05.350 --> 01:59:15.750]  Well, there's a little bit but not not anywhere near the most thing that I've heard that people have problems with with LED is that the light you buy.
[01:59:15.750 --> 01:59:24.550]  You really need to like spec it for what it's for because you'll like unless it's dialable and most of them are,
[01:59:24.550 --> 01:59:36.850]  but some of them aren't dialable, you know, you're you're going to burn your plants like I've done required to be like four to six feet off your canopy just like an HPS.
[01:59:36.850 --> 01:59:45.750]  And then some of them are spec to be 18 inches off of your canopy, you know, and you really want one.
[01:59:45.750 --> 01:59:50.550]  You can dial right London. And it's also like what what what type there's a couple things.
[01:59:50.550 --> 01:59:53.950]  Okay, like I find LEDs are flat. So you got to grow differently.
[01:59:53.950 --> 02:00:01.750]  That's why I shape my plants the way I do but it's also like the thing with the LEDs is they do generate heat.
[02:00:01.750 --> 02:00:06.750]  They do generate a bit of that but it also depends on like your draw from the wall.
[02:00:06.750 --> 02:00:18.150]  Right? If you have a shit ton of draw from the wall and you take a shit ton of power and you don't have enough electricity going through the socket to get to your get to your light,
[02:00:18.150 --> 02:00:28.650]  you'll you'll draw and you'll get your light on but you might not get it as powerful as you would if you have like a high current panel with with it with a proper cord on it too.
[02:00:28.650 --> 02:00:40.150]  Right? So it really depends on like there's a number of factors involved when you have have a good light and with the LEDs do like I've been I haven't had a chance to play with red spectrum.
[02:00:40.150 --> 02:00:52.150]  I've done I've grown on the blur poles. I've grown on bar lighting like ones that are just above here and then this is a similar bar lighting but a lot more powerful with like a lot more color spectrum control and variability.
[02:00:53.150 --> 02:01:04.150]  So I haven't gotten a chance to tune in to stuff like that but I want to play like especially in Canada where you have internet spacing and when you have really tight buds you can run into powdery mildew issues and run into problems in Pacific Northwest.
[02:01:04.150 --> 02:01:13.150]  Like why not pump up that red spectrum at the end to get a little bit more stretch like and also you know result in a little bit earlier of a flip.
[02:01:13.150 --> 02:01:17.150]  Like why not? Why don't I play with that? Why don't I dig into that a little bit further?
[02:01:17.150 --> 02:01:27.150]  I haven't had enough opportunity to play with it yet. I got an episode coming up where we do a little bit of a deep dive on the LEDs. Go ahead Ghost.
[02:01:27.150 --> 02:01:56.150]  Boop. Boopadoop. Okay. So yeah. On that red fucking spectrum and playing with the spectrum it's like that's what I'm really interested in and you were you you hooked me up with those folks with the LED company and I want to like you know look at that and see how I can be able to manipulate you know the spectrum that I'm playing with.
[02:01:56.150 --> 02:02:24.060]  The spectrum that I'm messing with and it's really I'm sorry if I'm really loud on here but I just I really like that like whole idea of just being able to screw with all that and kind of just basically.
[02:02:25.060 --> 02:02:53.060]  Uh gosh darn it. I'm high as **** Um basically like you know just do that whole damn thing like and and and and bring that whole thing together and and do the like okay we want to like go and say okay this is going to overlap with this. We're going to cross this with this and then this is going to go and.
[02:02:53.060 --> 02:02:54.060]  Yeah.
[02:03:23.060 --> 02:03:27.060]  Yeah.
[02:03:54.980 --> 02:04:03.500]  Yeah. So I'll just like mute my mic.
[02:04:04.500 --> 02:04:30.500]  I mean never really thought of some of the things like that I guess. Everybody thinks of different stuff. I think minds are great. You know I'm more of a I I like to say a people watcher and stuff. I like to you know I'm more into the scientists of being a person scientist like a sociologist. Right.
[02:04:30.500 --> 02:04:31.500]  Right.
[02:04:31.500 --> 02:04:32.500]  Yeah.
[02:04:32.500 --> 02:04:33.500]  Yeah.
[02:04:33.500 --> 02:04:34.500]  I psychopath.
[02:04:34.500 --> 02:04:35.500]  Because that's what I.
[02:04:35.500 --> 02:04:36.500]  Yeah.
[02:04:36.500 --> 02:04:37.500]  That's who you know.
[02:04:37.500 --> 02:04:38.500]  So everybody's.
[02:04:38.500 --> 02:04:39.500]  Having to do.
[02:04:39.500 --> 02:04:40.500]  The thing.
[02:04:40.500 --> 02:04:41.500]  The.
[02:04:41.500 --> 02:04:42.500]  The.
[02:04:42.500 --> 02:04:43.500]  TV show you.
[02:04:43.500 --> 02:04:44.500]  You seen that.
[02:04:44.500 --> 02:04:45.500]  That's.
[02:04:45.500 --> 02:04:46.500]  Yeah.
[02:04:46.500 --> 02:04:47.500]  That guy.
[02:04:47.500 --> 02:04:48.500]  Man.
[02:04:48.500 --> 02:04:49.500]  Uh.
[02:04:49.500 --> 02:04:56.500]  You know what we're getting we're getting to the two hour point and things start to meander and fail at around about two hours.
[02:04:57.500 --> 02:05:02.500]  So I don't know if you guys can tell you got a closing comment for us there.
[02:05:02.500 --> 02:05:06.500]  Coastal grown OG brother.
[02:05:06.500 --> 02:05:09.500]  Yes.
[02:05:09.500 --> 02:05:16.500]  Every fucking LED light that anyone thinks I should try to run.
[02:05:16.500 --> 02:05:19.500]  I need all the.
[02:05:20.500 --> 02:05:31.500]  Just put it in the comments everything but all the like high LED like anything from 650 watts to 1000 watts LED.
[02:05:31.500 --> 02:05:34.500]  I'm trying to switch over.
[02:05:34.500 --> 02:05:37.500]  I am not trying to use HBS anymore.
[02:05:37.500 --> 02:05:43.500]  I'm converting over I have too many HBS lamps and I'm fucking getting rid of them.
[02:05:44.500 --> 02:05:50.350]  Whatever anyone can suggest I will.
[02:05:50.350 --> 02:05:53.350]  Very very gratefully.
[02:05:53.350 --> 02:05:56.350]  Taken into suggestion.
[02:05:56.350 --> 02:05:57.350]  So.
[02:05:57.350 --> 02:06:03.350]  I can say that maybe you can check your state because I know Maine is giving rebates.
[02:06:03.350 --> 02:06:06.350]  If you switch over I don't know what it's all about.
[02:06:06.350 --> 02:06:08.350]  You need to have so many of them to get the.
[02:06:08.350 --> 02:06:10.350]  I don't know any of it.
[02:06:10.350 --> 02:06:17.350]  But I heard that if you switch from HBS to LEDs you get some sort of a rebate.
[02:06:17.350 --> 02:06:19.350]  I think the state.
[02:06:19.350 --> 02:06:20.350]  I don't know.
[02:06:20.350 --> 02:06:24.350]  I think they're just trying to get people to stop using HBS.
[02:06:24.350 --> 02:06:25.350]  Yeah.
[02:06:25.350 --> 02:06:30.350]  I also think they're trying to get people to report what they're doing.
[02:06:30.350 --> 02:06:39.350]  But I mean in other words I'm talking you know I don't know how many you have you know and I mean if you got enough of them then it might be worth it.
[02:06:39.350 --> 02:06:40.350]  Yeah.
[02:06:40.350 --> 02:06:41.350]  Yeah.
[02:06:41.350 --> 02:06:48.350]  To me it's like this ridiculous thing like a thousand watts for a high pressure sodium is just too much.
[02:06:48.350 --> 02:06:52.350]  So I want to bring it down and.
[02:06:52.350 --> 02:06:57.860]  Yeah.
[02:06:57.860 --> 02:07:04.860]  We're getting we're like yeah we're we're eventually getting out of here and yeah we're moving out of state.
[02:07:04.860 --> 02:07:10.860]  This is not going to work for us living here.
[02:07:10.860 --> 02:07:15.860]  We'll be we'll be moving up north soon hopefully.
[02:07:15.860 --> 02:07:21.350]  And yeah.
[02:07:21.350 --> 02:07:28.350]  Has anybody heard of under if like the potency is the same.
[02:07:28.350 --> 02:07:39.350]  Like have you taken this like to have the same cultivars and I mean grown them well under each light and seeing if it.
[02:07:40.350 --> 02:07:50.350]  I mean I have heard that growing under LEDs you know really boosts your turps because you're not vaping them off because they're so volatile.
[02:07:50.350 --> 02:07:58.350]  The esters and stuff but like I wonder about the potency like I know the chemo bar that that's one thing in the plant.
[02:07:59.350 --> 02:08:07.350]  The stress factor you know the stressing the stress inducing that you do to put things in flower.
[02:08:07.350 --> 02:08:15.350]  You know if that if that makes a difference because really under an LED they're not there.
[02:08:15.350 --> 02:08:22.350]  Those different information is yeah they're not they're not there like you know I've.
[02:08:22.350 --> 02:08:24.350]  I mean I don't know I'm wondering has anybody.
[02:08:25.350 --> 02:08:40.350]  Because I've been thinking about converting to LEDs myself and I've looked at many companies I'm just like commercially like I've never seen anybody commercially come in to any dispensary with a fat ass sack of weed and it's just.
[02:08:41.350 --> 02:08:57.350]  Bomb you know what I'm saying and they can't turn it down and be like yeah I grew that under LEDs I haven't seen it yet I've seen some nice nice tents and some home growers do some very well jobs you know jobs well done doing it.
[02:08:57.350 --> 02:09:03.350]  But I just haven't seen anybody pull that off like commercially under LEDs.
[02:09:04.350 --> 02:09:05.350]  So I'm wondering you know.
[02:09:05.350 --> 02:09:10.350]  I'd like to yeah I can fucking tell you like yeah exactly.
[02:09:11.350 --> 02:09:26.350]  So HIDs that are like fucking like dual end fucking HPS or just even single and HPS will out fucking yield.
[02:09:27.350 --> 02:09:46.350]  The thousand watt equivalent fucking LEDs it's not even a fucking fight I'm actually on the fucking verge of switching to that so I'm actually going and trying to go and get like 1500 watts equivalent of LED because I just need to move on.
[02:09:47.350 --> 02:09:50.350]  Like the HPS is way too hot.
[02:09:50.350 --> 02:10:03.350]  Can I throw a suggestion out there Coastal when you're going into this stage because it's something new that you're jumping into and one of the one of the things that I find a lot of these LED companies really fuck people on is this watt equivalency bullshit okay.
[02:10:04.350 --> 02:10:05.350]  Yeah exactly.
[02:10:05.350 --> 02:10:14.350]  If something's got a 1000 watt draw from the wall it's got a 1000 watt draw from the wall okay like that's what it's about it's not an equivalent it's not a blah blah blah.
[02:10:15.350 --> 02:10:21.350]  And see what the levels you get and see what you pull off and find out where your canopy needs to be because.
[02:10:22.350 --> 02:10:28.350]  You can get great numbers off of LEDs you just need to grow differently you can't you're not you don't have the same type of president.
[02:10:28.350 --> 02:10:55.350]  It's just like there's like if you're if you're going to use an LED and you're thinking about it like it find a friend with a PPFD meter and and and check it and see what the levels you get and see what you pull off and find out where your canopy needs to be because you can get great numbers off of LEDs you just need to grow differently you can't you're not you don't have the same type of president penetration and you got a different you got a different growing plant when it comes to LEDs and traditional lighting.
[02:10:59.350 --> 02:11:15.350]  And on the on the output like I was like on the stuff that that your person was was was giving me I was like you know what this is perfectly fine you know it's all great you know the output was perfectly fine.
[02:11:15.350 --> 02:11:44.350]  I just I just don't like I don't know if I want to do more than one of them because it seems so like you know so much deeper than the other bullshit ones from America so that's where I was kind of at I was like oh okay well the American ones were like twice as much.
[02:11:46.350 --> 02:12:05.460]  So you know like maybe I'll get two of these from Canada and I think we've burned we've talked about LEDs in the switch enough.
[02:12:06.460 --> 02:12:07.460]  Holy fuck.
[02:12:08.460 --> 02:12:09.460]  Look at that.
[02:12:10.460 --> 02:12:11.460]  Holy.
[02:12:16.460 --> 02:12:18.460]  Trees your flowers look awesome.
[02:12:19.460 --> 02:12:20.460]  So you know.
[02:12:23.460 --> 02:12:32.460]  Hey London on the on that power meter you're talking about when you be wanting a lux meter under LEDs.
[02:12:33.460 --> 02:12:40.460]  I don't know you should just make sure you have something to measure it that's consistent and accurate that can give you a relative information.
[02:12:40.460 --> 02:12:43.460]  Where do you like to run yours do you have you ever used one.
[02:12:43.460 --> 02:12:50.460]  I think I had one when we set it up and he showed me the comparisons and other than that I'm not that that you had the thing.
[02:12:50.460 --> 02:12:51.460]  Yeah okay.
[02:12:52.460 --> 02:13:13.460]  I'll find that out but you know what Nick I can do is I will find that out for you and I will burn the earth in the process of doing so I promise you fucking that I'll tell you what I might not know the answer now but I will find it or I will get to stone and totally forget that I need to wonder the other but we'll find out at one point or another.
[02:13:14.460 --> 02:13:19.460]  So Mr. Trees you've been getting verbal blowjobs for two straight hours and you missed all of it.
[02:13:23.460 --> 02:13:42.460]  Yeah well I thought for sure I thought for sure I checked my email earlier and I was like we supposed to go on tonight and I then I was like okay and my my son had a basketball his first basketball thing so we went out and started playing basketball and I was like okay.
[02:13:43.460 --> 02:13:55.460]  My phone was dead and I was charging it inside and I walked inside and I saw Peter's message and I'm like oh shit my in trouble.
[02:13:55.460 --> 02:14:01.740]  I was like, oh my god, so I can't believe it.
[02:14:01.740 --> 02:14:04.660]  I apologize, but I was spaced out there.
[02:14:04.660 --> 02:14:06.900]  I don't even got to smoke any weed.
[02:14:06.900 --> 02:14:07.900]  So that's what I'm doing right now.
[02:14:07.900 --> 02:14:09.260]  I'm finally getting around to that.
[02:14:09.260 --> 02:14:12.780]  So I thank you for allowing me to come smoke some weed.
[02:14:12.780 --> 02:14:18.020]  I was like, it's about that time, you know, if we if we got away with a whole episode
[02:14:18.020 --> 02:14:19.020]  without Mr.
[02:14:19.020 --> 02:14:20.020]  Trees.
[02:14:20.020 --> 02:14:22.900]  This was really just an hour.
[02:14:22.900 --> 02:14:25.060]  It was a two hour teaser for people to get excited.
[02:14:26.060 --> 02:14:27.060]  It's like we're going to get Mr. Trees here.
[02:14:27.060 --> 02:14:28.060]  We should have been teasing people the whole time.
[02:14:28.060 --> 02:14:29.060]  Mr. Trees is coming.
[02:14:29.060 --> 02:14:30.060]  Yeah, that was close.
[02:14:30.060 --> 02:14:31.060]  We almost we almost ended the show.
[02:14:31.060 --> 02:14:32.060]  You almost bailed.
[02:14:32.060 --> 02:14:33.060]  He's a rock star man.
[02:14:33.060 --> 02:14:34.060]  That's what rock stars do.
[02:14:34.060 --> 02:14:35.060]  They show up.
[02:14:35.060 --> 02:14:36.060]  Fuck yeah.

[02:14:43.820 --> 02:15:06.860]  We got some beautiful fucking flowers all of us do.
[02:15:06.860 --> 02:15:07.860]  It's it's quite excellent.
[02:15:07.860 --> 02:15:12.320]  You got, you got some beautiful generics and fun plants there with some good diversity
[02:15:12.320 --> 02:15:19.080]  and uh some fun stuff for people to play with. Hell yeah. Hell yeah. You like and what's
[02:15:19.080 --> 02:15:26.120]  your uh what's your ice cream cake what's your favorite one uh smelling like? I've been
[02:15:26.120 --> 02:15:30.280]  a little stuffed up the last few days like the last week it's been kind of shitty so
[02:15:30.280 --> 02:15:35.640]  I don't know when anything smells like that much except for this one berry. You know that
[02:15:35.640 --> 02:15:40.520]  just is taking over the whole space right now so I want to give a good accurate opinion
[02:15:40.520 --> 02:15:47.480]  of it but there's there's some there's several different structures what they're quite beautiful
[02:15:47.480 --> 02:15:58.640]  they're they're really well they're nice they're nice plant. Hell yeah. Have you ever smoked
[02:15:58.640 --> 02:16:07.080]  your Pam? Yeah you smoking your Pam your Pam one yet? No it's uh I just uh bucked it yesterday
[02:16:07.080 --> 02:16:12.360]  so it's still I'm I'm gonna give it a little bit I don't want to rush it there's not that
[02:16:12.360 --> 02:16:18.440]  much of it you know it's just a little couple little plants but I was wanting to know uh
[02:16:18.440 --> 02:16:28.040]  do you have any F2s of it have you crossed any of them back to of the uh Kandahar stuff
[02:16:28.040 --> 02:16:33.840]  I have not yet I have not um taken any of them to the new generation yet so I wanted
[02:16:33.840 --> 02:16:40.720]  to see kind of you know what everybody was gonna do with them see you know what the what
[02:16:40.720 --> 02:16:49.520]  the sharpness was if it was worth taking on you know um my SFV Pam one crosses everybody
[02:16:49.520 --> 02:16:55.000]  grow those out we made a whole bunch of those a bunch of different people grew them out
[02:16:55.000 --> 02:17:00.120]  and a lot of people ended up having keepers and everybody kept asking me for more of those
[02:17:00.120 --> 02:17:05.320]  ones so um I'm trying to figure out you know which direction which ones are gonna be the
[02:17:05.320 --> 02:17:13.480]  ones that I should work on um and push forward you know the Royal Kush uh Kandahars are really
[02:17:13.480 --> 02:17:18.640]  really really neat plants um starting to see a lot more of those and those are really really
[02:17:18.640 --> 02:17:25.480]  neat ones um but I don't know it's kind of up to up to you guys and a few others out
[02:17:25.480 --> 02:17:33.400]  there in the group on uh you know if anything makes it that's worthy I think you need to
[02:17:33.400 --> 02:17:39.640]  send me more seats so I can find out some more for you oh yeah yeah you got it you these
[02:17:39.640 --> 02:17:46.760]  are beautiful plants like what are you showing here Cory I got a question for Mr. Tree so
[02:17:46.760 --> 02:17:55.600]  this is day 21 and I absolutely love that plant I love all these plants um and they're
[02:17:55.600 --> 02:18:04.440]  all coming along pretty good the shorter more squat one looks like it's a little bit
[02:18:04.440 --> 02:18:14.560]  slower on the draw but then I've got this one that's not I mean she's starting to this
[02:18:14.560 --> 02:18:22.560]  have you had any that seemed slow to flower is that um which that's the SFV which one
[02:18:22.560 --> 02:18:30.520]  is that is that the uh that's the SFV one yep yeah so um no I've never I haven't had
[02:18:30.520 --> 02:18:38.480]  them be that that behind um but I do have um maybe some fire vine that I've been playing
[02:18:38.480 --> 02:18:43.880]  with for a little while and it seems like they take a little bit like you know an extra
[02:18:43.880 --> 02:18:49.840]  week or two to really try to build build any pom poms I gotta show you this don't miss
[02:18:49.840 --> 02:18:59.720]  the trees this is that uh uh the um you forget the name of it oh the cool ranch oh what a
[02:18:59.720 --> 02:19:11.160]  plant this is man dude this is a killer plant it's absolutely take it it's just unbelievable
[02:19:11.160 --> 02:19:13.400]  the one next this is three plants next to it
[02:19:13.400 --> 02:19:27.640]  you got pine pine turn oh it smells so funky it's got like a limp up like a limey piney
[02:19:27.640 --> 02:19:36.280]  stinky yeah it's it's it's killer hell yeah it's killing yeah I absolutely love this plant
[02:19:36.280 --> 02:19:42.600]  yeah nice do you got you got cuttings of that or what say it again did you take any
[02:19:42.600 --> 02:19:49.520]  cuttings of that one yep nice nice yeah that's a line that I didn't make a ton of man that's
[02:19:49.520 --> 02:19:54.560]  one that went out there and I knew was really good we grew a couple of them I fucking I
[02:19:54.560 --> 02:19:58.760]  love the pine tar that I used in that one which was this way you know why I was asking
[02:19:58.760 --> 02:20:03.120]  about the pine that that particular pine tar that I used in that one was fucking killer
[02:20:03.120 --> 02:20:13.560]  it's just it's a it's a beast the beast cool hey mr. treats you find that that pining terpene
[02:20:13.560 --> 02:20:18.400]  profile carries when dominant with dominancy right like I just oh yeah I have a breeding
[02:20:18.400 --> 02:20:24.000]  project with a bunch of fucking terpene lean dominant with one terpene lean dominant one
[02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:30.280]  that was really like more fruity and stuff like fairly different and like one was earthy and I'm
[02:20:30.280 --> 02:20:35.680]  getting like the whole thing just like fucking 20 plants later all of them are just terpene lean
[02:20:35.680 --> 02:20:41.880]  fucking dominant there they have a they have their tones and their diversities as well but
[02:20:41.880 --> 02:20:47.640]  it's just like all terpene lean dominant you notice that like is the pining like something
[02:20:47.640 --> 02:20:51.920]  you got to find a hunt out or is it like something that's like hey bring it into something and it's
[02:20:51.920 --> 02:20:59.400]  like BAM takes over the whole breeding project yeah man pine is super super strong you know it
[02:20:59.400 --> 02:21:03.920]  depends on I guess where you're pulling the pine from but if you're pulling from like a pine line
[02:21:03.920 --> 02:21:13.480]  like the I've got it pulling from Ryan Lee's chimera chimera line the pine sweet island skunk
[02:21:13.480 --> 02:21:19.960]  divergent right on you know so that's that's one pining I have grown enough it is I should go more
[02:21:19.960 --> 02:21:25.600]  of his stuff to see you know what his palates like because I respect him a lot you know what
[02:21:25.600 --> 02:21:31.200]  I mean so I should I should do more of that stuff to see see what I think about that but like the
[02:21:31.200 --> 02:21:41.920]  the 1979 Christmas bud the pine tar kush those two you know I played with both of those for a
[02:21:41.920 --> 02:21:48.560]  while several months on both sides and man it's like anything you cross that to you're gonna get
[02:21:48.560 --> 02:21:53.200]  some pine you're gonna get pine dominance you're gonna get lots and lots of lots of lots of pine
[02:21:53.360 --> 02:22:00.600]  some some is like really sharp some is really kind of like menthol eggs and ham what was that
[02:22:00.600 --> 02:22:07.120]  like the green eggs and hams got that in it yes yes okay that's the pine yeah that's okay cool I
[02:22:07.120 --> 02:22:14.760]  got that I'm excited yeah Santa's cookies which has the forum cut cookie the real forum cut cookie
[02:22:14.760 --> 02:22:23.160]  clone and the 1979 you know 19th Christmas bud and and the Santa's cookies was straight up pine
[02:22:23.160 --> 02:22:30.080]  across the board you know what I mean there he is pine across by the way are you going some of the
[02:22:30.080 --> 02:22:35.480]  Mac Mac Santa right now so this was someone mentioned grows choice so I threw the hat on
[02:22:35.480 --> 02:22:45.520]  but uh it it no no no no I was just thinking it's like you're talking about stuff it's like
[02:22:45.520 --> 02:22:52.440]  oh I ran that and like people like it but I moved on to new stuff it's kind of like a breeders like
[02:22:52.440 --> 02:23:01.120]  a musician right like you have your your your repertoire of songs and and it's like if you're
[02:23:01.120 --> 02:23:10.000]  the Rolling Stones you got to play like you could be so big that in any concert you could play any
[02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:18.120]  20 songs and people will be happy but if you have kind of if you're like a one-hit wonder like you
[02:23:18.120 --> 02:23:25.440]  got to play that one song so for you like as I hear like cool ranch and you're like oh yeah like
[02:23:25.440 --> 02:23:35.560]  that was cool but like what's the balance between keeping things going that are kind of like in the
[02:23:35.560 --> 02:23:42.960]  library versus just moving on to new stuff like how do you how do you mentally think about like
[02:23:42.960 --> 02:23:49.560]  there are people who really like the cool ranch I need to keep that going or like fuck it like
[02:23:49.560 --> 02:23:58.800]  that was cool and fun to do but I've moved on and that's like you're never gonna see or hear that
[02:23:58.800 --> 02:24:06.440]  again yeah you know that's like the toughest that's the toughest thing because it's like you
[02:24:06.440 --> 02:24:12.320]  can make something that's like really really cool or you think is really nice and then nobody likes
[02:24:12.320 --> 02:24:17.360]  it or nobody wants it you know I mean like nobody wants it you can make it a whole fuckload of it
[02:24:17.360 --> 02:24:22.040]  and just like nobody wants it and then you can make a whole bunch of stuff that you think will
[02:24:22.040 --> 02:24:27.800]  be cool that you spend a lot of time and effort on but then you end up like I really don't like
[02:24:27.800 --> 02:24:32.920]  to smoke that as much as the other stuff so like you just kind of move on from that you know in
[02:24:32.920 --> 02:24:41.120]  that aspect but usually what happens with me is I like to remake things and I can remake things as
[02:24:41.120 --> 02:24:46.320]  long as I keep the parents around you know I mean so if the parent is really worthy of me keeping
[02:24:46.320 --> 02:24:53.240]  around for whether it's like you know heirloom sake or I really really like it sake or it's
[02:24:53.240 --> 02:25:00.720]  earned a spot in the library then I'll find that I'll find something that I can do to remake that
[02:25:00.720 --> 02:25:05.640]  that particular whatever it does you know what I mean I'll remake it like like for instance the
[02:25:05.640 --> 02:25:14.680]  SFEPAM1 that earned respect from you know a lot of people and I enjoyed smoking it a lot and I
[02:25:14.800 --> 02:25:19.840]  have the parents so I can always remake that cross and I can keep that one going and I can
[02:25:19.840 --> 02:25:24.880]  work it further and I can look into it you know deeper and really kind of like spend more time
[02:25:24.880 --> 02:25:29.160]  on it because I do know that there's more people out there that are keeping the plants around that
[02:25:29.160 --> 02:25:35.440]  I'm you know from the seeds that I've made and then there's things that like are in like you're
[02:25:35.440 --> 02:25:41.200]  making something using say you you know you reverse something or you you have a male and you're in
[02:25:41.320 --> 02:25:47.960]  pollinating your your cross that you're making or whatever if you have other plants around at that
[02:25:47.960 --> 02:25:54.640]  time they're in flower that you can make seeds with too I always I always put some plants extra
[02:25:54.640 --> 02:26:00.560]  there like like the cool ranch that was like a one-off thing because I just had this pine tar
[02:26:00.560 --> 02:26:06.760]  that I really enjoyed and it was it happened to be in flower at this one at this at the right
[02:26:06.960 --> 02:26:12.200]  you know what I mean so it made it into the room with the pollination that got you know
[02:26:12.200 --> 02:26:16.320]  what I mean that made those seeds and it was just one plant so it wasn't a ton of seeds you know it
[02:26:16.320 --> 02:26:21.040]  was just enough to like for me to grow a little bit and then me to give out a bunch of you know
[02:26:21.040 --> 02:26:26.880]  give out the rest and then it turns out that that one everybody liked but I couldn't remake it because
[02:26:26.880 --> 02:26:31.440]  I didn't keep the parents you know what I mean so I'd have to rely on like somebody out there
[02:26:31.680 --> 02:26:38.120]  finding a really cool plant that they really liked and you know let me see it and if I really
[02:26:38.120 --> 02:26:44.120]  liked it then I can we could further the line or work the line or it's like a lottery for whoever
[02:26:44.120 --> 02:26:50.120]  got those cool ranch seeds shit now that's your that's your line that you can work that's that
[02:26:50.120 --> 02:26:54.200]  you know you have the keys to the ship now you know what I mean on this line and you can kind
[02:26:54.200 --> 02:26:59.720]  of make your own thing and take it and run with it so there's like a lot of different plants that
[02:26:59.880 --> 02:27:05.240]  you know I make a whole bunch of different crosses that were just like just to make the cross
[02:27:05.880 --> 02:27:10.840]  because it's a good plant and I have pollen flying and like you know Ryan Lee always says
[02:27:10.840 --> 02:27:14.920]  if pollen's flying you might as well hit as many things as you can you know and that's that's the
[02:27:14.920 --> 02:27:20.200]  philosophy I've always lived by you know what I mean you know just you know make as much seed as
[02:27:20.200 --> 02:27:27.160]  you can with the stuff you have and man there's so many crosses that I wish that I made more of
[02:27:27.160 --> 02:27:32.600]  or that I should have like kept that parent around a little bit longer because the stuff
[02:27:32.600 --> 02:27:38.760]  that came out of it is just phenomenal you know so as of lately I've been trying to hold on to
[02:27:38.760 --> 02:27:45.240]  the parents and really be thoughtful about it and then have people grow them and then if I have the
[02:27:45.240 --> 02:27:50.120]  parents in the stock I'll remake what what people like you know what I mean and then we can keep
[02:27:50.120 --> 02:27:55.000]  that around and we'll work we'll work on that so I've been trying to be more focused because I'm
[02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:59.720]  figuring out what people like a little bit more and I'm figuring out how to you know navigate that
[02:27:59.720 --> 02:28:05.320]  but it's always the one-off shit it's like you write this three chord song and it's the stupidest
[02:28:05.320 --> 02:28:09.400]  three chords in the world but everybody loves that fucking song so you have to you have to play that
[02:28:09.400 --> 02:28:13.880]  song at every show you hate the song but you got to play it you know I mean it's just those those
[02:28:13.880 --> 02:28:19.480]  random one-off and that's Sansa's cookies which Cory meant Cory was like I love the Santa cookies
[02:28:19.480 --> 02:28:28.760]  and it's like fuck like I don't have any more of that yep yep it's a bummer but like I said
[02:28:29.320 --> 02:28:34.840]  he's got the keys to the ship right now so if that's a it's that's why I asked if he had clones
[02:28:34.840 --> 02:28:39.640]  because he knows that it really is a good plant and he likes it he's got he's got the keys to the
[02:28:39.640 --> 02:28:44.600]  ship so um that's something you know that's something that's pretty cool that that people
[02:28:45.160 --> 02:28:50.440]  when they jump on those little one-off things that don't get remade sometimes you find something
[02:28:50.440 --> 02:29:00.760]  that you know that can change your game you know which is cool be like like it's interesting because
[02:29:00.760 --> 02:29:09.240]  because I feel like like jinx right I feel like nine pound hammer is always going to be right
[02:29:09.240 --> 02:29:17.320]  like that there I could be like I'm low in this and he'll always have that right so it's kind of
[02:29:17.320 --> 02:29:26.840]  like I have my like I'm a musician I have my like Pam yeah like what like for you it would be Pam
[02:29:27.480 --> 02:29:33.640]  yeah I will like you're not gonna be like oh fuck I lost it and I don't have any more of that
[02:29:34.120 --> 02:29:41.640]  that that's like your that's your uh sympathy for the devil yeah like that's like your greatest hit
[02:29:42.280 --> 02:29:48.040]  it is yeah no it's like currently currently you're still young it's funny because like
[02:29:49.240 --> 02:29:55.400]  there's some plants that make you know an infinite amount of seeds that are just really really good
[02:29:55.400 --> 02:30:00.680]  from one plant you can get you know thousands of seeds and then there's plants that it'll just give
[02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:04.920]  it'll just give you that same size plant will give you a hundred seeds you know what I mean
[02:30:04.920 --> 02:30:11.560]  and you know Pam's a good breeder so Pam one like Pam 15 is different than Pam one but Pam one when
[02:30:11.560 --> 02:30:16.440]  you make seeds with Pam with Pam one all the crosses you can get a good amount of seed and
[02:30:16.440 --> 02:30:20.360]  when you make and you work the line you can get a good amount of seed and over the years I played
[02:30:20.360 --> 02:30:27.880]  with that plant for so long like and didn't grow anything else so I you know Pam seeds that's
[02:30:27.880 --> 02:30:35.320]  something that that's my nine pound hammer for sure you know I won't run out of those but
[02:30:37.080 --> 02:30:42.680]  I'm trying I'm doing uh I'm making the cowboy caviar right now and that's the one that I think
[02:30:42.680 --> 02:30:47.080]  is is is gonna be the best you know that's one of my favorites it's gonna be the one that I'm
[02:30:47.080 --> 02:30:52.680]  gonna work on for a long time so um we'll do a show on the cowboy caviar that's gonna come out
[02:30:52.680 --> 02:31:00.520]  pretty soon that's the SFE the dog walker feminized um yeah the my two my two favorite
[02:31:00.520 --> 02:31:07.400]  like emptying the jar plants are coming together in the cowboy caviar so I'm I'm excited about that
[02:31:07.400 --> 02:31:16.680]  one um it's funny because I've seen like recipes across my stream of like cowboy caviar yeah I know
[02:31:17.400 --> 02:31:25.400]  corn and uh my wife just made a while my wife just said man there was just a story on cowboy caviar
[02:31:25.400 --> 02:31:30.600]  and I'm like what the fuck what is cowboy caviar and like I just figured out that there's a thing
[02:31:30.600 --> 02:31:36.760]  called that which is ridiculous and kind of breaks my heart I had to look at I was like all right
[02:31:36.760 --> 02:31:44.040]  what's in cowboy caviar I was I literally just caviar from a cheap fish is it like catfish caviar
[02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:49.080]  no I just learned it the other day my wife made it for the I never had it before
[02:31:49.800 --> 02:31:54.600]  three days ago and I've never heard of it till three days ago now it's coming up again I need
[02:31:54.600 --> 02:32:06.840]  to have those that's crazy it's like chips and corn salad basically I mean beans and stuff that's
[02:32:07.320 --> 02:32:15.080]  good good yeah I don't know I have no idea what it is I've always it's corn salad pretty much with
[02:32:15.080 --> 02:32:20.040]  some my wife said that years ago that that name years ago and I always said man I'm gonna use
[02:32:20.040 --> 02:32:25.160]  that one day and it's funny like now it starts flashing up and I'm like fuck I gotta use that
[02:32:25.160 --> 02:32:33.560]  shit it's a cool name so but yeah no that's that's gonna be a good one and I keep the parents of that
[02:32:33.560 --> 02:32:38.520]  so that's something that I can remake you know and do do things like that which is which is pretty
[02:32:38.520 --> 02:32:45.080]  cool and the candahar stuff I have I have the pure stock and the p1 stock of that so I can remake
[02:32:45.080 --> 02:32:52.120]  stuff of that if I if we find out we we like that you know if not then we'll move on again you know
[02:32:52.760 --> 02:32:59.800]  now do you wear the hat all day like at the kids basketball game was the hat on so please tell me
[02:32:59.880 --> 02:33:03.560]  you're playing basketball please tell me you're fucking weird
[02:33:05.560 --> 02:33:09.480]  and it's kind of in like a you know you know an upscale neighborhood where we send the kids to
[02:33:09.480 --> 02:33:13.320]  play the basketball game you're not gonna tell us you're swimming with it on are you
[02:33:14.200 --> 02:33:19.240]  and I've got my shears on my hip and like they sent the security guy to come tell me that I had
[02:33:19.240 --> 02:33:25.000]  to leave my shears in the car the next time and I was like oh come on you guys are killing me
[02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:31.800]  wait were those the robocop sure real always like walking it's hot here all the time always in the
[02:33:31.800 --> 02:33:39.400]  sun so nine ninety percent of the time I got the hat on but when I'm you know it comes off I put
[02:33:39.400 --> 02:33:44.040]  on this I put on this other hat that like covers my neck so I don't get bit by mosquitoes at night
[02:33:44.040 --> 02:33:51.640]  so I change hats from this one to my mosquito hat and my headlamp and mosquito hat and then uh
[02:33:52.600 --> 02:33:56.760]  when I really get hot playing basketball because I've been I've been we've been working hard
[02:33:57.480 --> 02:34:03.960]  the hat's off for basketball so I look like a basketball player you're you do not uh
[02:34:06.040 --> 02:34:11.160]  like you know how some like NBA players are like I played one-on-one with my dad and he like did
[02:34:11.160 --> 02:34:18.520]  not let me win and then finally one day I started beating him are you like swatting balls and like
[02:34:19.480 --> 02:34:27.480]  I got my little my six-year-old like I got you know I got he's my middle son he likes to he likes
[02:34:27.480 --> 02:34:34.200]  to play basketball and he's good he likes to train and he he spends all day dribbling and doing stuff
[02:34:34.200 --> 02:34:38.920]  and you know practicing and really working on it you know working on the he's doing like the
[02:34:38.920 --> 02:34:44.840]  Steph Curry two ball dribbles no joke yeah no bullshit you know like he he asked me to raise up
[02:34:45.480 --> 02:34:50.200]  the hoop the other day so we raised up the hoop you know raised it up even higher you know and
[02:34:50.200 --> 02:34:56.920]  we went out there and lately I want we need him to be more aggressive he's like he's like super good
[02:34:56.920 --> 02:35:00.840]  but he's just he's too nice you know when it comes down to it his older brother's super super
[02:35:00.840 --> 02:35:04.760]  aggressive it'll rip your freaking heart out you know what I mean and you know kick your knees in
[02:35:04.760 --> 02:35:09.560]  when you're not looking but he's like he's a little sweeter you know what I mean he he needs
[02:35:09.560 --> 02:35:14.680]  he needs a little bit more you know aggressive nature so I've been teaching him to drive drive
[02:35:14.680 --> 02:35:19.640]  to the hoop you know drive through me to the hoop and when he gets up there if he stops early
[02:35:19.640 --> 02:35:23.960]  that ball gets swatted as soon as he tries to do it when he does it wrong you know he swat the ball
[02:35:23.960 --> 02:35:28.520]  and he does again we'll spend hours you know working on that you know which is which is good
[02:35:29.160 --> 02:35:33.400]  but he's got man he's he's got this crossover and it's behind the backs he's six and he's
[02:35:33.640 --> 02:35:40.280]  killing it out there it's pretty cool you know so it's fun it's fun stuff but I love playing too
[02:35:40.280 --> 02:35:46.840]  so I've been trying to figure out we're gonna do like some sort of a tournament you know a
[02:35:46.840 --> 02:35:51.320]  basketball tournament you know I knew I know Peter would be down to help you know put this put this
[02:35:51.320 --> 02:35:58.840]  together but I think we should do like a like a like a basketball one-on-one seed tournament
[02:35:59.320 --> 02:36:04.600]  for like you know seeds and prizes and charity and all kinds of fun stuff and put together some
[02:36:04.600 --> 02:36:10.120]  sort of like a I don't know if it would be like a breeder ball or like everybody everybody ball
[02:36:10.120 --> 02:36:16.440]  just just you know like some sort of a one-on-one is this where you guys just kids the whole time
[02:36:16.440 --> 02:36:21.240]  is this because it's not you started with the first thing you get children are you are you
[02:36:21.320 --> 02:36:27.640]  always competing against kids so is this you versus your son
[02:36:38.190 --> 02:36:41.950]  I love you you love me
[02:36:42.750 --> 02:36:47.390]  you're a happy family
[02:36:47.390 --> 02:36:51.390]  with a great big hug and a kiss
[02:36:58.030 --> 02:37:06.750]  oh that's the shit Charles dude that's my boy you know I remember when when uh Michael Jordan and
[02:37:07.710 --> 02:37:14.670]  the Bulls came to Phoenix and beat Barkley on our on our turf I was still living in Arizona man and
[02:37:14.670 --> 02:37:20.190]  everybody was heartbroken all the Phoenix Suns flags were flying and everybody had a friggin
[02:37:20.190 --> 02:37:27.390]  you know flag in their yard it was like the pride of you know like Dan Marley and you know Danny
[02:37:27.390 --> 02:37:32.110]  Ainge and friggin all those dudes back of the day dude it was that was crazy stuff you know
[02:37:32.190 --> 02:37:38.190]  that must have been an old Danny Ainge on the team right oh yeah back when they had him on the team
[02:37:38.190 --> 02:37:44.030]  exactly yeah have your boy watch Charles Barkley and show him Charles Barkley and that'll show him

[02:38:29.870 --> 02:38:34.590]  with all the skills in the world playing playing basketball and work boots just like old Mr. Trees
[02:38:35.230 --> 02:38:40.590]  and he's shredding fools you know and he just needs to talk about yourself Adam Sandler's one of the
[02:38:40.590 --> 02:38:47.150]  greatest like scouts and he and he brings him and trains him to get to the NBA you know what I mean
[02:38:47.710 --> 02:38:55.310]  it's badass dude it's pretty sick so it was my my four-year-old's birthday party today and we had a
[02:38:55.310 --> 02:39:04.110]  pinata and it was funny seeing all these four-year-olds like some kids would like tap it
[02:39:04.110 --> 02:39:11.230]  like it was like love taps from underneath and then like so it was like girls and boys and
[02:39:11.310 --> 02:39:13.310]  and then
[02:39:13.310 --> 02:39:21.230]  90% of the kids were just like kind of like gently tapping the pinata and like the occasional kid
[02:39:21.230 --> 02:39:27.630]  would just take huge rips at it but the funniest part was watching the kids who would just like
[02:39:27.630 --> 02:39:32.830]  lightly tap at it and just thinking of like personality traits and like
[02:39:33.310 --> 02:39:40.830]  totally yeah no that was my afternoon of of like observing four-year-olds and levels of
[02:39:40.830 --> 02:39:46.270]  aggressiveness towards a pinata no no no that's we always have pinatas so I know exactly what
[02:39:46.270 --> 02:39:50.430]  you're talking about you know it's those kids that just tap it and like you know don't really
[02:39:50.430 --> 02:39:55.710]  like the one that hit a tap from underneath yeah and then there's like the kids that like you have
[02:39:55.710 --> 02:39:59.870]  to pull away you're not getting that candy because you can stop you can't stop you can't
[02:40:00.590 --> 02:40:10.190]  stop everybody out you know those are the people oh yeah send somebody home with a black guy like
[02:40:10.190 --> 02:40:17.870]  snoop or like uh I think it was snoop like he posts just random shit or someone posted something
[02:40:17.870 --> 02:40:26.110]  of like there's a pinata and they blindfolded some lady and like her friend was like setting it up
[02:40:26.910 --> 02:40:33.630]  yeah yeah just like whacked and like hit her friend on the back of the head who got knocked out
[02:40:37.710 --> 02:40:40.750]  if anyone knows what I'm talking about but that was fun

[02:42:19.220 --> 02:42:26.820]  tightened it up a little bit so it made it like less less open but if the density on that looks
[02:42:26.820 --> 02:42:34.180]  beautiful yeah one of them is one of them's a little bit fluffy um I got a couple phenotypes

[02:43:20.650 --> 02:43:28.650]  oh that looks that looks nice that looks powerful yeah that's a chunky one that uh
[02:43:30.330 --> 02:43:36.970]  it it is nice it's really dense it was uh it just doesn't have the nose that the other ones had
[02:43:38.170 --> 02:43:47.210]  like this one has some it smells really citrusy it's got some like orange uh skunk kind of
[02:43:47.530 --> 02:43:49.290]  uh it's really nice
[02:43:52.090 --> 02:43:54.010]  it's got a little bit of fuel to it
[02:43:56.170 --> 02:44:02.170]  um there was which one is your favorite it was probably that one
[02:44:04.010 --> 02:44:13.290]  the the one that London just showed and that was number seven for me um that one was pretty good
[02:44:13.290 --> 02:44:23.050]  um it it had some uh some skunkier turps to it some more fuel and then there was one that was
[02:44:23.050 --> 02:44:33.370]  just like was my favorite in the garden but it was uh it was yeah this one it was my favorite in
[02:44:33.370 --> 02:44:41.930]  the garden but then it ended up being super kind of ugly but it's got this the the best turps man
[02:44:42.330 --> 02:44:49.850]  it's so what day is it at uh this was 10 and a half or 11 weeks i'm pretty sure this was like 70
[02:44:49.850 --> 02:45:00.980]  days but yeah that one uh and then that one it was the sparkliest one and it was that one was
[02:45:00.980 --> 02:45:20.480]  super nice i ran that under a single-ended 1000 yeah it looks raw that looks it looks like it's
[02:45:20.480 --> 02:45:26.000]  got some power you know it looks raw though it looks really land racy and really really really
[02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:34.320]  cool looking really interesting you know yeah it really reminds me of uh some of the uh nl5 or nl2
[02:45:34.320 --> 02:45:42.960]  crosses that um but it's got it's uh like i was saying it's really got these garbage turps in it
[02:45:42.960 --> 02:45:49.360]  like it's some of them it's like really like raw meat or something it's it's uh but you know
[02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:57.600]  like the one the pams that really came through are like super citrusy and i haven't had very
[02:45:57.600 --> 02:46:07.280]  many of those type of plants like it's uh it's a really unique type of citrus so it's um it's funky
[02:46:08.320 --> 02:46:12.560]  like i don't know like i was saying from the start i don't know if it was like nutmeg
[02:46:13.200 --> 02:46:23.040]  or cinnamon but there's it gives it this uh this sweet uh undertone to everything
[02:46:24.400 --> 02:46:30.160]  and then you know you have the different variations of more fuel or more citrus but
[02:46:30.160 --> 02:46:37.120]  yeah everything was it stacked pretty well i'm i'm excited to smoke it i just uh bucked it the
[02:46:37.120 --> 02:46:45.120]  day before yesterday so uh give it a week or two and i'll be smoking it next episode baby next
[02:46:45.120 --> 02:46:51.760]  episode yeah i'm gonna throw some of them outside too because i got some clones and i'm gonna wait
[02:46:51.760 --> 02:46:56.720]  uh through this rocking like a hundred and something degrees right now so i'm gonna wait
[02:46:56.720 --> 02:47:01.760]  until it cools down a little bit and grow them up grow them up a little bit more and then throw
[02:47:01.760 --> 02:47:08.320]  them outside like last minute and see if uh the expressions don't come out a little different
[02:47:08.320 --> 02:47:15.200]  outside you know um i know a lot of breeders they just take a clone and throw the seed away
[02:47:16.160 --> 02:47:23.200]  and they'll only want to work from a clone instead of a seed because they throw different expressions
[02:47:23.200 --> 02:47:29.120]  like you could have a rocking seed and then you take a clone from it and it's it's the clone
[02:47:29.120 --> 02:47:36.560]  doesn't take well it just throws a whole different expression almost it just it's not worth what the
[02:47:36.560 --> 02:47:42.960]  seed was you know and then like some plants just carry through with the clones better so i want to
[02:47:42.960 --> 02:47:49.520]  see which ones i kept them all and i have my male that i picked to work with so like i said i was
[02:47:49.520 --> 02:47:57.040]  probably gonna make some f2s and cross it to a lady breath and i have a lady breath that i
[02:47:57.760 --> 02:48:10.720]  cross to uh brandon russ's uh tk tk nl5 on haze and i'm gonna do that and see uh get some to you
[02:48:10.720 --> 02:48:18.000]  and uh everybody else and we'll just you know be nice little variations from the fam
[02:48:18.960 --> 02:48:21.280]  and then have some f2s of the pan
[02:48:21.520 --> 02:48:29.760]  i think those are the best expressions you know they give a bigger diversity that have to
[02:48:33.840 --> 02:48:39.280]  i uh i ran through all my all my gear at the start of the episode and unfortunately the
[02:48:39.280 --> 02:48:44.720]  lights are out now so i can't show you mr trees i'd love to you've gone sideways for some reason
[02:48:45.680 --> 02:48:53.520]  i have to look at you sideways oh there you go there you go um but i what was i saying um
[02:48:54.160 --> 02:48:59.280]  ran through them but next week next saturday you'll see them front and center at least one or
[02:48:59.280 --> 02:49:04.080]  two of it at my wedding because we've got them like the two males will be at like a couple points
[02:49:04.080 --> 02:49:08.960]  in the in the wedding location and there'll be the flowers will be all about the place so and
[02:49:08.960 --> 02:49:13.440]  they're gorgeous there's there's three they're very distinctly different plants you can they're
[02:49:13.440 --> 02:49:18.640]  like very distinctly different plants but they're pretty cool and they're i can't wait till i'm
[02:49:18.640 --> 02:49:22.720]  actually able to smell and get the aroma off of them but the they're looking pretty good i'm
[02:49:22.720 --> 02:49:32.560]  excited for them well tyler can you talk about kind of the role of the seed plant versus clones
[02:49:32.560 --> 02:49:39.920]  as you're breeding and like like looking at stuff and testing and
[02:49:42.240 --> 02:49:44.480]  propagating and and you're muted
[02:49:49.680 --> 02:49:52.720]  this is like a site like a 1920s silent movie
[02:49:59.840 --> 02:50:04.400]  you got to go back in and out bro you're gonna have to go back in and out just refresh that browser
[02:50:05.040 --> 02:50:10.480]  i mean i hate to do this but i gotta go like my attend to my wife we have a wedding coming up next
[02:50:10.480 --> 02:50:15.600]  week and it's like i've been i i can't i can't go through more than three hours so i'm gonna have
[02:50:15.600 --> 02:50:23.360]  to bounce really quick here but you guys can keep rolling i don't need to be here see you
[02:50:25.840 --> 02:50:29.200]  i'll say bye to mr cheese i want to give give that a second say goodbye to mr trees
[02:50:29.200 --> 02:50:34.960]  and he's back my wife's like i have to do this it's like a week out i shouldn't have to do stuff
[02:50:34.960 --> 02:50:38.960]  like design like things why do i have to do that now oh wait mr trees add
[02:50:39.840 --> 02:50:46.640]  oh all of us have to deal with that you go ahead you got you got control now you take it
[02:50:46.640 --> 02:50:53.520]  honey i'm relinquishing i'm no longer touching can you hear us can you hear me yes beautiful
[02:50:54.080 --> 02:50:58.480]  mr trees i gotta go i gotta go i gotta i got some shit i gotta do before bed tonight
[02:50:58.480 --> 02:51:03.440]  my wife will kill me i i appreciate you and i love and appreciate you and i will send you a
[02:51:03.440 --> 02:51:07.440]  bunch of photos and and if you can check out earlier in the voting video we did run through
[02:51:07.440 --> 02:51:12.400]  all your stuff that i have mine it'll make sure love you love and appreciate you have a fun wedding
[02:51:12.400 --> 02:51:18.560]  and shit man thank you and everybody show up on tuesday big dab day of bet dang this yes bye
[02:51:19.120 --> 02:51:26.560]  so uh seed versus clone if you're going to you know he's absolutely right like you should
[02:51:26.560 --> 02:51:30.320]  a lot of people would just take it they'd clone it and they'd throw the seed plant away
[02:51:31.760 --> 02:51:37.520]  and then just look at the clone see what the clone does sometimes that clone will go intersects
[02:51:37.520 --> 02:51:41.440]  really easily and it's just a lot of people will just take it and clone it and then throw
[02:51:41.440 --> 02:51:47.280]  the seed plant away and then just look at the clone see what the clone does sometimes that clone
[02:51:47.280 --> 02:51:54.160]  intersects really easily sometimes they they kind of you know they don't grow real well they kind
[02:51:54.160 --> 02:52:01.840]  of freak out they sometimes they just the the weed that comes off of them isn't as good as is the seed
[02:52:01.840 --> 02:52:06.080]  plant you know all these different things can happen with the clone sometimes it grows better
[02:52:06.080 --> 02:52:11.920]  as a clone i've taken it i've grown it from seed plant you take a clone you flower it out you're
[02:52:11.920 --> 02:52:18.320]  like fuck this thing was better than than it was the first time so it's kind of a you know it's if
[02:52:18.320 --> 02:52:22.160]  you're really planning on keeping a clone or keeping it around and working on it that way
[02:52:22.160 --> 02:52:28.320]  then yeah you should you should concentrate on you know taking the clone growing it up take the clone
[02:52:29.040 --> 02:52:35.600]  i've always been greedy and i always use the seed plant in some way you know i'll either flower it
[02:52:35.600 --> 02:52:40.480]  out and smoke it because you know shit that's what we're doing it for or i'll flower it out and seed
[02:52:40.480 --> 02:52:48.640]  it or i'll grow it up flower it out decide that i'm like holy shit i love this i should have saved
[02:52:48.640 --> 02:52:53.840]  this you know what i mean cut it back re-veg it you know seed it and then you know what i mean
[02:52:53.840 --> 02:53:00.560]  and then move on from it to clone it and then seed it you know sometimes i've done it you know and
[02:53:00.560 --> 02:53:04.960]  i've done it you know i've done it twice now you know what i mean so um i've done that several
[02:53:04.960 --> 02:53:11.120]  different times but yeah the clones are most important uh there's been some plants that i've
[02:53:11.120 --> 02:53:15.120]  found that i thought were really awesome plants and then i took clones of them and then the next
[02:53:15.120 --> 02:53:20.240]  time that i grew them they weren't really the same plant you know and they weren't worth keeping and
[02:53:21.760 --> 02:53:26.000]  a couple of them went intersex really easily were really temperamental when the
[02:53:26.000 --> 02:53:31.120]  when the seed plant never did you know in the same type of condition you know um so
[02:53:32.080 --> 02:53:38.400]  yeah um absolutely right on the seed seed to clone thing um you should concentrate on the
[02:53:38.400 --> 02:53:41.760]  clone if you're going to keep it around a long time but if you're just growing stuff
[02:53:41.760 --> 02:53:48.640]  from seed i mean yeah the seed plant is killer to grow outside growing seeds outside with a tap root
[02:53:48.640 --> 02:53:54.640]  and under the sun stuff like that you're gonna you know that's how you get trees you know real
[02:53:54.640 --> 02:54:02.480]  legit trees um and you know tougher plants and good harvests and stuff like that using seeds so
[02:54:02.480 --> 02:54:08.320]  there's there's different applications for it all the way around but i've always been greedy and done
[02:54:08.320 --> 02:54:14.480]  something with my seed plant um and always make sure to clone it and grow the clones you know a
[02:54:14.480 --> 02:54:17.680]  lot of different ways that way you figure out what you like to keep or what you don't keep
[02:54:19.200 --> 02:54:24.400]  but more oftentimes than not lately it's like i grow something from seed i take clones of
[02:54:24.400 --> 02:54:30.240]  everything now it's like i i'm done fucking around because every time i decide not to take
[02:54:30.240 --> 02:54:33.600]  clones of something is that's the one time i should have taken clones of something so
[02:54:34.160 --> 02:54:39.760]  um now it's it's for everything gets cloned and everything gets looked at properly that way i
[02:54:39.760 --> 02:54:46.960]  don't make any mistakes and waste more time you know so i've gotten better about that so i was
[02:54:47.440 --> 02:54:56.400]  uh at tom's house which you know yeah you've been to i was doing a seed run of these tide genetics
[02:54:57.680 --> 02:55:02.880]  and tom is moving to connecticut evidently next saturday
[02:55:04.720 --> 02:55:12.480]  so no way this week i have to go up to his house and basically like of the nine or ten plants i
[02:55:12.480 --> 02:55:22.480]  have there which were which are all this you know tie like i don't know what i call it land race but
[02:55:22.480 --> 02:55:29.680]  like heirloom um i need to take clones of each and every one and bring them back home
[02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:35.840]  where i have my wife who does not like the idea of me growing weed at home
[02:55:36.240 --> 02:55:40.720]  and i gotta i gotta root them and then find a new home for them all
[02:55:42.080 --> 02:55:49.040]  so that's my my next couple weeks oh yeah yeah you know that's the
[02:55:51.120 --> 02:55:56.080]  it's a good time of year to be able to do that you know if it was like week week three a flower
[02:55:56.080 --> 02:56:01.280]  or something and you had this problem then we it would be a hell of a you know it'd be it'd be a
[02:56:01.280 --> 02:56:09.200]  harsh time so it's good but but for like for breeding projects like the role of
[02:56:11.040 --> 02:56:16.080]  the tap the seed with the tap root versus clones like how do you use each
[02:56:20.400 --> 02:56:25.600]  all right you glitched out again my phone glitched out on you like like like it if you
[02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:30.160]  if you had 20 or 30 seeds that you
[02:56:32.160 --> 02:56:39.520]  sprouted and planted and they're growing so you have 20 to 30 taproot plants
[02:56:40.880 --> 02:56:49.760]  and then you take clones from each one how are you if you're focused on breeding like how are you
[02:56:49.840 --> 02:57:01.920]  using the seed stock versus the clone stock so as you focus on on like moving in directions and
[02:57:01.920 --> 02:57:08.400]  and creating more seeds so yeah so if you got a bunch of different plants that you gotta take
[02:57:08.400 --> 02:57:15.280]  clones of and and and look at yeah you got you got a label good so every plant gets like double
[02:57:15.280 --> 02:57:21.120]  labeled so you're you're taking clones off of 20 or 30 plants or whatever you know whatever you got
[02:57:21.120 --> 02:57:27.760]  you gotta you know you gotta put labels on it on this one this is this is chem b and you gotta
[02:57:27.760 --> 02:57:32.480]  match up your clones with chem b and they go and they go in one thing so you have to pick up a
[02:57:32.480 --> 02:57:39.120]  little bit of space the the more plants you grow the bigger your nursery has to be to hold all the
[02:57:39.120 --> 02:57:46.480]  plants with like a librarian type system so that you can you know go back to it and be like okay
[02:57:46.480 --> 02:57:50.560]  when that when you grow out that seed stock because then after that you've got all those
[02:57:50.560 --> 02:57:55.520]  seed stock plants in the ground right so those get flowered out right those ones will get flowered out
[02:57:55.520 --> 02:58:01.280]  you can kind of see what they are you know what i mean and then if there's one or two or whatever
[02:58:01.280 --> 02:58:06.960]  there is in there that are you know something that you're interested in you check the tag you match
[02:58:06.960 --> 02:58:13.360]  the tag tag with the nursery tag and then you get rid of the rest all the rest get killed and then
[02:58:13.360 --> 02:58:19.120]  you you can look at those two and then it becomes important to grow those clones now because those
[02:58:19.120 --> 02:58:24.800]  clones now have to be grown to figure out if it's worth worth a damn you know so it's like kind of
[02:58:24.800 --> 02:58:29.920]  a two-step process on you know you're growing outside that way takes a lot longer to do that
[02:58:30.880 --> 02:58:37.760]  but you know acclimating stuff with the tap root you know getting stuff to grow that you know it's
[02:58:37.760 --> 02:58:43.440]  that's part of the process so yeah they always get the seed ones get cloned they get flowered out
[02:58:44.000 --> 02:58:49.520]  and then they get matched up with the one that i want to keep or the two that i want to keep or
[02:58:49.520 --> 02:58:56.960]  whatever um two males two two females whatever three males whatever um and yeah that's the way
[02:58:56.960 --> 02:59:04.160]  you go but if you mess up your labeling or the clone from you know b3 died and you go back to
[02:59:04.160 --> 02:59:09.840]  look at it you know and it's like that one really isn't it's not there then you're screwed because
[02:59:09.840 --> 02:59:14.160]  you can then you got to re-veg you can dig up that plant and i've had to dig up those plants
[02:59:14.720 --> 02:59:20.240]  and cut them back and bring them back inside and try to re-veg them so you can get some clones off
[02:59:20.240 --> 02:59:25.920]  of them if they're really really worth it and you can go through this whole other oh god oh god
[02:59:25.920 --> 02:59:33.760]  forget it fucking fucking like decides to herm out and then fucking throw some fucking like bananas
[02:59:34.400 --> 02:59:41.360]  and then it fucks with everything else i know you're really yeah yeah yeah
[02:59:43.280 --> 02:59:49.840]  so i've had so many of those that are just phenomenal though and then you know they just
[02:59:49.840 --> 02:59:57.040]  do their little herm thing and i mean some of them don't have pollen some of them do and it's
[02:59:57.040 --> 03:00:05.200]  like man i mean i've even taken some of them and i've tried to uh some of them will breed
[03:00:06.080 --> 03:00:12.320]  well like i mean and you run through that seed stock and they those seeds don't harm
[03:00:12.640 --> 03:00:17.120]  and then some of them they do you know and it's like man
[03:00:18.880 --> 03:00:24.960]  i wasted it i wasted this much time or this was a good mistake i mean sometimes
[03:00:26.080 --> 03:00:35.440]  uh you know that's that's how uh that's how um a lot of good genetics were made was from
[03:00:36.320 --> 03:00:43.920]  herms i mean but there's some there's some stuff out there that's like you know it's like you
[03:00:43.920 --> 03:00:49.360]  you just don't have we all don't have the heart to kill you know so if you find plants like that
[03:00:49.360 --> 03:00:56.160]  you know sometimes you know if you're if you're willing to deal with it then it's all good you
[03:00:56.160 --> 03:01:00.960]  know if you know how to deal with it there's some plants you can strip down and work on and make
[03:01:00.960 --> 03:01:07.120]  sure that their their situation is is good to go so they won't do it on you you know but if you
[03:01:07.120 --> 03:01:12.160]  didn't know you know you'd be in trouble and then you know like you said some don't drop you know
[03:01:12.160 --> 03:01:18.240]  very much pollen or no pollen at all and then you got others that'll just turn really really late
[03:01:18.240 --> 03:01:25.920]  you know in in situation which is kind of doesn't matter you know at that point so yeah it's kind
[03:01:25.920 --> 03:01:30.240]  of what we're willing to deal with you know but it's survival man they're all they're all capable
[03:01:30.240 --> 03:01:36.000]  of doing that you know they're all able there it's it's in there no matter the land races really
[03:01:36.000 --> 03:01:43.200]  do it right there at the end you know yeah yeah the true heirloom variety or whatever they're just
[03:01:43.760 --> 03:01:53.120]  there's fucking thousands of them you know yeah it's right in those genetics it's like people
[03:01:53.200 --> 03:02:00.480]  think oh okay i'm breeding against like like uh like you know all this stuff like oh i'm just
[03:02:00.480 --> 03:02:07.360]  gonna make it so it doesn't uh harm out or all this bullshit and you're like fucking fighting
[03:02:07.360 --> 03:02:15.200]  to tide and then basically the these these like ruderalis genetics are just basically a really
[03:02:15.200 --> 03:02:22.640]  really strong version of the genetics and it's like people are just really fighting the tide on
[03:02:22.640 --> 03:02:32.400]  everything and i do not see a need to use ruderalis genetics in like major commercial production but
[03:02:32.400 --> 03:02:44.160]  i do see it for like personal production as as a usable thing um but yeah it this is hilarious i
[03:02:44.160 --> 03:02:53.200]  mean how people haven't seen how this literally the the tide is and how the genetics move and uh
[03:02:54.960 --> 03:03:04.080]  there there is no um i guess there's no argument anyone can make against it
[03:03:11.840 --> 03:03:17.600]  what about your uh your plants cory were they were they more on the musty side stinky side
[03:03:17.680 --> 03:03:21.920]  you got any fruit tones where do they dominate on that side one or the other
[03:03:23.920 --> 03:03:29.520]  i'm not getting i'm not getting a ton of anything that i can recognize it's kind of
[03:03:30.320 --> 03:03:38.560]  um spicy i get like a spicy smell maybe like uh
[03:03:39.440 --> 03:03:46.640]  i don't know how to explain it it's kind of a uh not cinnamon not anything not mag or i don't know
[03:03:46.640 --> 03:03:50.880]  it's something i'm not familiar with but it's it's almost like a spice or an herb or something
[03:03:50.880 --> 03:04:02.160]  of that nature on the taller ones um the short one that is showing flower uh that one's got more of a
[03:04:02.560 --> 03:04:10.880]  more of a musty smell um but you know i can't really distinguish a lot i mean like that
[03:04:11.680 --> 03:04:17.440]  cool ranch i feel like i might smell bo i'm not real good at pinpointing like oh i think
[03:04:17.440 --> 03:04:22.560]  it smells like that but the two that the two taller ones definitely are
[03:04:24.080 --> 03:04:30.160]  hey holla um the two taller ones are definitely got more of a spicy smell to them right now
[03:04:30.320 --> 03:04:40.330]  you're immune it's early for you still you know so yeah you're you're early you're not the fun
[03:04:40.330 --> 03:04:46.090]  really is just getting going but i'm interested in to see because i got a lot of those spicy weird
[03:04:46.090 --> 03:04:53.770]  uh it's a yeah spicy type tone some sort of uh what do you describe it as like like what kind
[03:04:53.770 --> 03:05:00.890]  of spices yeah it's like almost uh i don't know like a eucalyptus or uh
[03:05:01.770 --> 03:05:11.450]  i don't know it's some sort of uh some sort of a more of a rich kind of spicy spicy spicy smell
[03:05:11.450 --> 03:05:17.850]  was what i was getting on the dark chocolate type phenos of those you know otherwise i'd get more of
[03:05:17.850 --> 03:05:24.890]  those things and you get then you got this then it developed into this darker wine chocolate you know
[03:05:25.610 --> 03:05:30.570]  you know darker tones which is really cool and it transferred over into into taste
[03:05:31.210 --> 03:05:37.450]  in most all of them really well um but i do remember some sort of like uh
[03:05:39.690 --> 03:05:44.490]  i don't know i'm gonna say like cumin or something but it's more of like a nutmeg i mean
[03:05:45.130 --> 03:05:51.690]  i don't know yeah it's really yeah i mean you got you know it's it's sharp like that you know yeah
[03:05:51.770 --> 03:05:58.490]  it's a spice that i can't put my finger on but the musky one to me like it started musky and then
[03:05:58.490 --> 03:06:07.930]  it turned to like like raw meat or like garbage garbage yeah that's good and then one of them
[03:06:07.930 --> 03:06:13.610]  like but the taller ones were the terpene they're always the terpene one but sometimes like they're
[03:06:13.610 --> 03:06:21.370]  not the they're not the keepers you know they almost smell like like i don't maybe delicious
[03:06:22.010 --> 03:06:29.610]  as opposed to offensive maybe i don't know you know like that's yeah well that's good
[03:06:31.210 --> 03:06:36.250]  yeah i saw that comment so they got the pan 15 candahars crushing it outside so that's cool
[03:06:36.250 --> 03:06:43.530]  you know we'll have to get them with it they're saying f3 yeah yeah that's a nice point they get
[03:06:43.530 --> 03:06:49.610]  the boys club on that one though so but the pan the the candahars they got they got rolling well so
[03:06:50.570 --> 03:06:58.410]  yeah we'll have to get them in i got a black candahar i bought a pack from swami it's a black
[03:06:58.410 --> 03:07:03.530]  candahar tons uh i think it was deep chunk
[03:07:05.050 --> 03:07:07.060]  there we go
[03:07:11.060 --> 03:07:17.140]  one gallon uh hey i'll go straight to one gallon one gallon or two gallons from clumps
[03:07:17.140 --> 03:07:21.780]  from clumps i don't ever put them into four inch to answer that question that popped up there
[03:07:22.420 --> 03:07:28.660]  um i you know rarely unless i'm on a space issue or i only got four inches and i'm like oh shit i
[03:07:28.660 --> 03:07:34.660]  you know i don't have any one gallons and i usually do that but that's me you know some people the
[03:07:34.660 --> 03:07:39.220]  smaller the pot size and their situation you can get them to grow a little bit better and faster
[03:07:40.180 --> 03:07:54.200]  so but right on who we got here we're gonna look at the pans hey how y'all doing if you want i'll
[03:07:54.200 --> 03:08:04.600]  walk outside in the dark and show show mr trees the um it's the pam f i think f15 i kmrs is that
[03:08:04.600 --> 03:08:06.840]  right not f15
[03:08:09.320 --> 03:08:12.120]  the kmr crosses and then i have the the pam
[03:08:12.760 --> 03:08:19.960]  uh f3s the regular pam f3s but excuse me they were all they were all males
[03:08:23.160 --> 03:08:26.120]  can you guys hear me okay yeah oh yeah we got you
[03:08:27.560 --> 03:08:33.640]  they're sleeping it just stormed on the um these are the kmrs right here the three girls
[03:08:35.000 --> 03:08:43.250]  they're asleep but they're super vigorous for how old they are and they smell
[03:08:45.570 --> 03:08:46.930]  they smell fantastic
[03:08:54.750 --> 03:08:56.590]  i don't know if you can see excuse my mess
[03:08:56.590 --> 03:08:57.390]  so
[03:09:02.750 --> 03:09:26.080]  there's the the pam f3s right here can you guys can y'all hear me at all yeah we got you yeah
[03:09:28.880 --> 03:09:33.920]  it's pouring down rain and dripping and stuff all over my phone terrible pictures but
[03:09:34.560 --> 03:09:39.680]  you're coming in high definition audio and video oh okay
[03:09:42.640 --> 03:09:48.680]  those are the those are the candahar and 15 pan 15 candahar
[03:09:50.600 --> 03:09:56.120]  these right here are the were the pam f3s
[03:09:58.360 --> 03:09:59.160]  yeah it's pretty
[03:09:59.320 --> 03:10:05.400]  it's dead pretty and they're super vigorous but i think they're males i wish my eyes were better
[03:10:05.400 --> 03:10:17.240]  but i'm almost positive they're males um with the pam the pam 15s i had eight of them and five were
[03:10:17.240 --> 03:10:24.600]  males three were females um these are the females that are definitely they're definitely females
[03:10:25.560 --> 03:10:29.480]  and they're growing really well for the lack of food and the lack of care i've been giving them
[03:10:29.480 --> 03:10:36.120]  they've been pretty much been made to survive over here in the elements and then i'll show you
[03:10:36.120 --> 03:10:42.200]  the other boys of the pam 15 if i can get a picture of them in the dark here's the these are
[03:10:42.200 --> 03:10:52.280]  the pam 15 boys the uh 15 by kmr that's a nice looking boy yeah they're not old they're really
[03:10:52.600 --> 03:10:58.840]  vigorous growth they grew really fast and they were alongside a lot of other plants that that
[03:10:58.840 --> 03:11:04.520]  failed to survive through the elements and some of them got mildew some got pests on them stuff
[03:11:04.520 --> 03:11:08.600]  like that but these guys these guys were pretty bulletproof through all these rainstorms and
[03:11:09.320 --> 03:11:15.880]  some cool nights early on definitely some uh definitely some um plants i want to try to put
[03:11:15.880 --> 03:11:21.000]  in the swamp put in the woods for that kind of thing because pretty awesome yeah
[03:11:23.480 --> 03:11:27.560]  and if i can't kill them they're tough if i can't kill them or mess them up they're tough
[03:11:31.160 --> 03:11:36.040]  that's the shit yeah that's cool where where where are you again my phone was glitching out i
[03:11:36.040 --> 03:11:41.800]  couldn't hear you where you were where you're at i'm in virginia oh right on right on yeah yeah
[03:11:41.800 --> 03:11:47.000]  cool so they're not there with you it's a tough environment too yeah this environment i mean they
[03:11:47.000 --> 03:11:52.440]  took a storm they're they're doing they're doing well it's really really hard to find anything
[03:11:52.440 --> 03:11:57.640]  that can't yeah they can deal with the uh pottery mill uh i want my rooster upgrade i gotta go back
[03:11:57.640 --> 03:12:04.280]  inside yeah no i appreciate you appreciate you taking the walk that's really cool man
[03:12:05.080 --> 03:12:09.880]  no thank you for giving me keep me keep me posted on those ladies man those
[03:12:09.880 --> 03:12:15.960]  those pan 15s like some of my favorite some of my favorite smoke comes out of the 15 man so that's
[03:12:15.960 --> 03:12:22.520]  really interesting stuff yeah yeah it's interesting it's cool stuff it's got like i said it smells
[03:12:22.520 --> 03:12:29.480]  sounds fantastic it's sitting right by the door but but it is so right on the water in virginia
[03:12:29.480 --> 03:12:38.680]  is so pm's just a big issue like you just need stuff that can handle it or it is beyond a big
[03:12:38.680 --> 03:12:45.240]  issue um like to find stuff that doesn't end up getting it at some point around here for me it's
[03:12:46.520 --> 03:12:53.480]  it's tough those pans those plants i just showed you they survived the last five weeks or so i've
[03:12:54.040 --> 03:12:59.240]  i mean i've probably killed like 40 other plants like all my nerds testers died i just didn't want
[03:12:59.240 --> 03:13:07.240]  to say that on that all my uh all my cd all my mad dogs died all of i mean i had a lot of stuff
[03:13:07.240 --> 03:13:12.200]  growing in the same soil right beside these plants that fucking died i'm not trying i'm just
[03:13:13.960 --> 03:13:17.960]  no from others like bogs and stuff like the caterpillars crushing the other stuff they
[03:13:17.960 --> 03:13:23.480]  won't touch the fucking they won't touch those plants like there's no leaf hopper damage there's
[03:13:23.480 --> 03:13:28.600]  no caterpillar damage there's nothing they they're not fucking them and i don't know if it has to do
[03:13:28.600 --> 03:13:35.400]  with me putting um neem oil and karanja cake in the soil but it's in all the soil it's in all the
[03:13:35.400 --> 03:13:41.800]  other ones as well so there shouldn't really be a different balance of that on those plants so i
[03:13:41.800 --> 03:13:46.680]  don't i don't know but just an observation and i'm like i said i'm harry homeowner that's it
[03:13:49.560 --> 03:13:52.840]  i don't know what i'm doing but i'm trying to just observe figure it out
[03:13:52.840 --> 03:13:58.520]  and discern discern good information from bad which is kind of tricky these days was it all
[03:13:58.520 --> 03:14:06.920]  the eucalyptus wood chips that you uh put in the soil wow that was horrible i see i never i
[03:14:08.520 --> 03:14:12.520]  like i would have told anybody no do not put eucalyptus in your bugles
[03:14:13.080 --> 03:14:18.120]  but that's just because of what i heard i don't know how to remedy that mr cheese you have anything
[03:14:18.120 --> 03:14:23.880]  you have any advice so and by the way i'm looking at myself i i was in the sun today
[03:14:24.120 --> 03:14:35.960]  it was very hot i'm bright red but so we have another fellow socal person who got
[03:14:38.600 --> 03:14:46.040]  like someone he knew was like i have a dump truck's worth of eucalyptus wood chips
[03:14:47.000 --> 03:14:53.720]  oh and he's like you know the story yeah yeah no that's what i'm saying so so he was like
[03:14:53.720 --> 03:15:02.680]  fuck yeah like what like wood chips like like that's supposed to be awesome and he brought
[03:15:02.680 --> 03:15:09.720]  eucalyptus wood chips and this guy spread them all out in his yard and like worked him into the soil
[03:15:09.800 --> 03:15:17.720]  and was doing like hugel and he dug down three feet and he used 20 yards of eucalyptus leaf
[03:15:17.720 --> 03:15:22.600]  trimmings and small branches and he built a hugel culture and then he mulched everything with it
[03:15:23.400 --> 03:15:32.120]  so my my question to you is eventually will that work itself out like three years
[03:15:32.120 --> 03:15:38.520]  eventually i mean eventually i mean could be a long friggin time but yeah eventually it will work
[03:15:38.520 --> 03:15:43.720]  itself out there's like the tannins and stuff that are in there that discourages plant growth
[03:15:43.720 --> 03:15:50.040]  and it's just kind of uh over time the worms will eat that you know and things will will will do it
[03:15:50.040 --> 03:15:57.400]  but it'll take a lot of time and a lot of compost and you know a lot of effort you know so yeah i
[03:15:57.400 --> 03:16:03.160]  take as much of it out as you can but dug three feet 20 yards fuck it sounds like it's there
[03:16:04.120 --> 03:16:08.120]  so uh he went in hard he went in hard with all his heart
[03:16:10.200 --> 03:16:15.080]  and we had to break his heart i felt so bad for the guy yeah so it's like i know there's hope like
[03:16:15.080 --> 03:16:20.040]  in the in the long run but like for the first for the next few years it's going to be a really hard
[03:16:20.040 --> 03:16:24.760]  place to farm you know what i mean like it's going to be a hard place to farm but if you add if you
[03:16:24.760 --> 03:16:30.920]  constantly are adding some compost and you know you you know you keep on keep it moist and you
[03:16:31.000 --> 03:16:36.280]  just work on it you know what i mean um you know eventually you'll break down you'll break down
[03:16:36.280 --> 03:16:41.160]  those oils and those and that would turn it right back in and to you know to currency in that soil
[03:16:41.960 --> 03:16:48.680]  but yeah fuck how long that's that's anybody's guess i'm told i i was told this afternoon by an
[03:16:48.680 --> 03:16:54.600]  old man around here that said in addition to it having whatever the chemicals are that prevent
[03:16:54.600 --> 03:16:58.920]  other plants from being able to grow in that soil it is hyper toxic to humans and animals
[03:16:59.640 --> 03:17:04.920]  yeah well yeah when you when you yeah when you're eating it or if you're getting the oils and you
[03:17:04.920 --> 03:17:11.320]  know in substantial amounts and stuff i don't know like you're not going to be able to farm
[03:17:11.320 --> 03:17:16.520]  food in there for the time that i believe that it would be it's toxic you know what i mean like over
[03:17:16.520 --> 03:17:20.600]  you know things nothing's going to really want to grow in that area very well so like being able to
[03:17:21.320 --> 03:17:31.320]  and he's seen that like it's tree stops producing fruit yeah we were looking at this barren yard
[03:17:31.320 --> 03:17:39.160]  of just which it was all eucalyptus wood chips and i was like so like the one good thing for
[03:17:39.160 --> 03:17:44.120]  eucalyptus wood chips is like pathways you know you do pathways with them because it keeps it
[03:17:44.120 --> 03:17:49.400]  keeps everything out so you can kind of build major pathways with eucalyptus and that's the
[03:17:49.480 --> 03:17:54.360]  one time you can give a thumbs up and be like all right bring in the eucalyptus you know what i mean
[03:17:54.360 --> 03:18:02.600]  but like yes it's like tilling it in and and mulching with it and that being pure eucalyptus
[03:18:02.600 --> 03:18:11.080]  it's god man that's that's hard it's hard so like physical removal of as much possibility as you know
[03:18:11.080 --> 03:18:17.800]  metal rakes and and as many of your dude friends as you can to help pull as much of that out but
[03:18:17.800 --> 03:18:21.480]  there's there's stuff that's going to be there no matter what but don't worry i wouldn't worry
[03:18:21.480 --> 03:18:27.160]  about toxicity after being you know years you know two three years down the line you know what i mean
[03:18:27.160 --> 03:18:32.120]  after you've broken it down and added some compost and built some stuff up you know what i mean i
[03:18:32.120 --> 03:18:38.120]  think you i think you'd be fine that's not no one wants to have lots of groves so once the plants
[03:18:38.120 --> 03:18:44.200]  look healthy you wouldn't be worried about like toxists yeah no no i wouldn't what about hemp
[03:18:44.360 --> 03:18:49.720]  um what about lots of groves that are in like rancho santa fe which is like under eucalyptus
[03:18:49.720 --> 03:18:55.960]  groves and it's like it's been eucalyptus groves for forever you know what i mean it's just yeah
[03:18:56.920 --> 03:19:02.040]  and we're constantly dealing with that right and and i have thousands of trees that are that are
[03:19:02.040 --> 03:19:06.840]  under eucalyptus and eucalyptus environment with eucalyptus shit falling on them all the time you
[03:19:06.840 --> 03:19:12.680]  know what i mean it's like yeah that fruit's not toxic it's okay you know good that's a real hell
[03:19:12.760 --> 03:19:19.080]  of a time growing and we battle it you know but it's you know it is where it is you know what i
[03:19:19.080 --> 03:19:25.160]  mean but good it's just gonna take you some some time that's it's just time you gotta farm somewhere
[03:19:25.160 --> 03:19:31.720]  else you know farm on top of that build something on top of that stuff and beds and farm on top of
[03:19:31.720 --> 03:19:39.320]  it you know the general because the rest of us were not we were unqualified scientific minds
[03:19:40.280 --> 03:19:47.240]  right the the consensus was that sucks in the short term in the long term you'll be okay
[03:19:47.960 --> 03:19:55.000]  and in the short term just growing pots with some like potting soil what about hemp would that help
[03:19:55.000 --> 03:20:03.400]  right yeah i was like you're like so people grow hemp to pull bad things out of the ground
[03:20:03.880 --> 03:20:10.520]  yeah hemp might have a hell of a time growing there you know even that first
[03:20:10.520 --> 03:20:17.960]  got your time around you know but yeah as a as a remover of toxins we we saw his plants were like
[03:20:17.960 --> 03:20:25.640]  this tall and yellow oh yeah right yeah you're in trouble for sure there's a lot of unhappiness of
[03:20:25.640 --> 03:20:31.960]  of every plant yeah you can try doing foliar feeds and stuff more to try to push them through you
[03:20:31.960 --> 03:20:35.080]  know so that they're they're they're eating through their leaves instead of eating through
[03:20:35.080 --> 03:20:39.160]  their roots very much you know so you're kind of force feeding them on the iv you can kind of push
[03:20:39.160 --> 03:20:44.520]  some things you know through a little bit you know it's not you know it's not the best thing
[03:20:44.520 --> 03:20:48.600]  but if that's what you're dealing with and those are your options and that's the hand that you're
[03:20:48.600 --> 03:20:52.680]  rolled and you're gonna you're gonna play that game then that's a tool that you should get into
[03:20:52.680 --> 03:20:58.760]  your tool belt is do a little bit more foliar feeds and be more diverse in what you're putting
[03:20:59.080 --> 03:21:04.760]  on those leaves that might help you out a little bit we need to do like the weed version of like
[03:21:04.760 --> 03:21:12.840]  cooking shows where like you and other good growers are dealt shitty hands all right
[03:21:15.880 --> 03:21:21.720]  is all eucalyptus wood chips and go totally and see if we can
[03:21:21.720 --> 03:21:35.480]  we need some funding for that you know anybody you know let's let's get that going because
[03:21:35.480 --> 03:21:44.440]  that's great yeah and go yeah totally you know every deficiency known to this thing has every
[03:21:44.440 --> 03:21:56.520]  deficiency known to man you have graham crackers and and sardines yeah i get i get those texts
[03:21:58.920 --> 03:21:59.320]  and like
[03:22:03.480 --> 03:22:06.520]  like a three things that do not go together
[03:22:07.000 --> 03:22:16.120]  uh totally but yeah that that was just listening and be like and like i was psyched because
[03:22:16.920 --> 03:22:22.600]  someone brought a dump truck's worth of eucalyptus wood chips
[03:22:25.800 --> 03:22:31.000]  yeah and then he was showing he was showing his yard and everyone was like that doesn't look right
[03:22:31.720 --> 03:22:38.280]  that doesn't look right i kept wanting to tell him like the whole way i was in on it from early
[03:22:38.280 --> 03:22:43.240]  on i kept wanting to tell him i think your i think your cubicle culture is still too hot i think it's
[03:22:43.240 --> 03:22:47.400]  too young have you like check this out i was trying to figure it out but i never thought to say
[03:22:47.400 --> 03:22:53.480]  wait a minute are those eucalyptus chips yeah it didn't even occur to me to ask that
[03:22:54.440 --> 03:23:01.560]  oh yeah but but all right so forget eucalyptus just wood chips in general
[03:23:02.440 --> 03:23:06.120]  in early stages they they compete for nitrogen
[03:23:10.200 --> 03:23:18.680]  but but wouldn't that imply that a hugel bed in its early like in year one the plants that are
[03:23:18.680 --> 03:23:25.320]  growing on top of it are just like not happy because the the hugel bed is basically like a
[03:23:25.320 --> 03:23:30.760]  big wood chip the first year they're not tapped into any of that wood or that source unless you've
[03:23:30.760 --> 03:23:36.280]  burnt it down or broken it down some way you know you know where there is that you know initially
[03:23:36.280 --> 03:23:41.960]  that wood source that you put in there is for later on and you should make sure that that
[03:23:41.960 --> 03:23:46.680]  wood is really freaking old and aged and been sitting around a while you know what i mean it
[03:23:46.680 --> 03:23:50.600]  shouldn't be like fresh wood that you just chop down the tree and it's like green wood and it's
[03:23:50.600 --> 03:23:55.720]  still got moisture and stuff from the trees and stuff that that'll make things unhappy that'll
[03:23:55.720 --> 03:24:01.800]  rob them the soil that'll cause problems um if you bury it other things like that but if you bury a
[03:24:01.800 --> 03:24:07.000]  bunch of hot compost in the soil and stuff that creates that same thing so if you build a hugel
[03:24:07.000 --> 03:24:12.040]  that's too hot you got a lot of compost covered up and a lot of fresh wood chips that are you know
[03:24:12.040 --> 03:24:16.840]  got a lot of it hasn't been dried out and aged for a little while then yeah you're you're in
[03:24:16.840 --> 03:24:22.200]  your your first you know go around growing anything it's going to just be terrible um plants
[03:24:22.200 --> 03:24:25.560]  are going to be unhappy it's going to be a nightmare it's going to be near impossible but
[03:24:26.120 --> 03:24:32.360]  to have really good success doing something you know with it but after after that's had some time
[03:24:32.360 --> 03:24:40.120]  to go through a winter and settle in and actually do that that next season on the game the game
[03:24:40.120 --> 03:24:44.920]  changes you know substantially you know and that just depends on how you built it and what you do
[03:24:44.920 --> 03:24:50.680]  you know but specifically why that's an issue is because the microbes that are breaking down the
[03:24:50.680 --> 03:24:57.160]  wood chips are are using an intense amount of nitrogen and that's taking away the nitrogen
[03:24:57.160 --> 03:25:03.720]  that the plant roots want so yeah so there's there's a combination of that and if it's fresh
[03:25:03.720 --> 03:25:09.640]  stuff then you have the you have the the decaying and the the evaporatization of like you know the
[03:25:09.640 --> 03:25:15.480]  the oils and the breakdown of all those gases and things if you bury like you know like fresh
[03:25:15.480 --> 03:25:22.840]  vegetable um scraps underneath of your worm bin you know mulch you can get a bunch of methane gas
[03:25:22.840 --> 03:25:28.360]  build up and stuff and kill your worms and hurt your worms so like by burying the fresh stuff that
[03:25:28.360 --> 03:25:35.480]  that decay and that breakup by the microbes and you know the aging process yeah you you you can
[03:25:36.040 --> 03:25:40.120]  you can you can cause problems that way and that's what that's what steals the energy
[03:25:40.120 --> 03:25:43.960]  you know what i mean that you need to break it down that needs to go other places but if your
[03:25:43.960 --> 03:25:52.040]  woods really aged and old and you're using it on top like a like a mulch like in their chips then
[03:25:52.760 --> 03:25:57.160]  you know you're going to call worms are going to be able to access that you'll start seeing worms
[03:25:57.160 --> 03:26:02.520]  and other you know like small insects and things that are living and breaking down that that first
[03:26:02.520 --> 03:26:07.160]  layer that dust layer that wood chips as it breaks down over time but the stuff you bury
[03:26:08.520 --> 03:26:16.680]  you know that's it's that it depends it depends on how you know what it is how you know how um
[03:26:17.240 --> 03:26:22.680]  how old it is how much moisture is in there if you burnt it if you broke it down at all and like
[03:26:22.680 --> 03:26:29.080]  prepared it a little bit for the microbes um that i mean how much compost or if you put
[03:26:29.080 --> 03:26:33.560]  straight manures in there a lot of people will put straight raw manures and stuff in there as well
[03:26:33.560 --> 03:26:38.360]  and you're just building up this this engine that's going to take an extreme amount of energy
[03:26:38.360 --> 03:26:44.840]  to start breaking down this this stuff that you've stockpiled in there and that's going to create too
[03:26:44.840 --> 03:26:50.920]  much heat and energy and stuff that's going to be bad for your plants you know so older age stuff
[03:26:51.480 --> 03:26:57.720]  and less like you know less bearing of really hot items you know what i mean i try to put everything
[03:26:57.720 --> 03:27:05.000]  on the on the surface so that roots of plants can go away from the hot stuff if you put hot
[03:27:05.000 --> 03:27:09.800]  compost on there and it's a little too hot or you know your wood chips they can they can go down in
[03:27:09.800 --> 03:27:14.600]  a way but if you mix all that stuff into your soil then you can kind of they have nowhere to run they
[03:27:14.600 --> 03:27:19.160]  they can burn up that way especially in pots if you like take pot if you take like some plain old
[03:27:19.160 --> 03:27:25.480]  potting soil like a like a sunshine mix or a you know a freaking pro mix or whatever and then you
[03:27:25.480 --> 03:27:29.960]  add some compost to that some good compost and you mix it up and then pop some plants in like
[03:27:29.960 --> 03:27:35.560]  one gallon pots or whatever and then put clones in it a lot of your plants will you know be sick
[03:27:35.560 --> 03:27:39.160]  and they'll get burnt up a little bit because you bury in that compost you're going to have this
[03:27:39.880 --> 03:27:44.120]  this this heating of the soil a little bit so you got to be careful what you bury you got to
[03:27:44.120 --> 03:27:49.960]  you know you got to be methodical and and and really you know i i try to break it down a little
[03:27:49.960 --> 03:28:00.440]  bit i've buried a lot of not so old wood chips but but my so my question is if i'm like a year
[03:28:00.440 --> 03:28:05.720]  and a half out from burying those wood chips thinking it was a good idea in the first place i
[03:28:05.720 --> 03:28:19.160]  was like like aeration like like like water like at the very bottom of my like 30 or 45 gallon pots
[03:28:22.120 --> 03:28:30.440]  my thinking which may or may not have been correct was like i i had tons of wood chips so i like
[03:28:30.440 --> 03:28:38.200]  wanted to do something with them so in the bottom it's like the um the clay pellets and wood chips
[03:28:39.480 --> 03:28:48.680]  and then kind of i put my like compost and either sphagnum or cocoa and then aeration
[03:28:50.600 --> 03:28:55.080]  but in some of those pots or raised beds i've just been like
[03:28:55.320 --> 03:28:57.320]  i've been like
[03:28:57.320 --> 03:29:03.800]  this isn't doing as well as i hoped i was like i have huge almost like hugel at the very bottom
[03:29:04.760 --> 03:29:11.000]  and like at least i'm not gonna get um like waterlogged roots
[03:29:13.480 --> 03:29:20.920]  but there's just like a struggling that i've noticed and but so my question is
[03:29:21.480 --> 03:29:25.240]  have i fought through it if i'm in like year two and a half
[03:29:27.800 --> 03:29:34.040]  or do i need to like dump it all out and in like because a lot of times i'll take like small pots
[03:29:34.040 --> 03:29:40.120]  and i'll dump them into like bigger bins and kind of mix everything up and then put it back yeah
[03:29:41.640 --> 03:29:46.840]  so like you know you can you can bury wood i mean there's it's been done forever you know
[03:29:47.800 --> 03:29:52.760]  there's all different types of to you know cultures that have done it and do it it's just
[03:29:52.760 --> 03:29:57.800]  a matter of does it become a soggy mess on the bottom that allows moisture and stuff to go
[03:29:57.800 --> 03:30:05.400]  through you got enough pellet and rock air and you know stuff that the air and the water can kind of
[03:30:05.400 --> 03:30:09.880]  go through it so i don't i don't think you need to dump it out if you are going to dump it out
[03:30:09.880 --> 03:30:13.720]  then yeah you dump it out and you just mix it up you wouldn't put more more wood chips in the
[03:30:13.720 --> 03:30:19.400]  bottom of the pots if you're doing it in pots if you're doing it in like wood beds that were like
[03:30:19.400 --> 03:30:24.120]  you know raised up a lot and you needed to save some space and you wanted to put logs and
[03:30:24.120 --> 03:30:29.880]  you know compost and stuff down there that first you know then fill it up with some soil and then
[03:30:29.880 --> 03:30:34.040]  grow some vegetables up there they're only going to use this soil over time yeah that's going to
[03:30:34.040 --> 03:30:39.560]  be better but i don't you know putting some bark chips in the bottom of a pot i don't think it's
[03:30:39.560 --> 03:30:43.720]  going to be much good you know you bet you'd be better off doing rocks in the bottom of the pot or
[03:30:43.720 --> 03:30:51.000]  gravel or pumice or or something like that um if you're trying to like you know get rid of it you
[03:30:51.000 --> 03:30:56.760]  know do a layer up layer of pumice rock or yeah something like that would be better and then put
[03:30:56.760 --> 03:31:04.360]  the bark on top and then you know you got you got the best of both worlds i guess my question is is
[03:31:04.360 --> 03:31:13.560]  more like if i've already done it don't don't mess with it if plants are growing good what the plants
[03:31:13.560 --> 03:31:14.120]  are sucking
[03:31:17.320 --> 03:31:22.760]  add some you can add some compost to the you know to the surface of the soil like i'm saying you put
[03:31:22.760 --> 03:31:27.960]  things on the surface you can plant your new plants and stuff and you can mulch the surface a
[03:31:27.960 --> 03:31:31.880]  little bit and if plants are doing okay then i would never change it a bit but if they're not
[03:31:31.880 --> 03:31:36.920]  doing well and everything you kind of put in those those beds in particular or just not growing
[03:31:36.920 --> 03:31:44.360]  good then yeah it's it's time to refurb those things and pots don't last forever you know if
[03:31:44.360 --> 03:31:49.960]  it's not plugged into the ground or you got to take them apart every now and again you know
[03:31:51.000 --> 03:31:56.920]  smaller they are the sooner you got to do it so so when people are doing hugel beds is it
[03:31:56.920 --> 03:32:03.560]  kind of like don't like don't use a tree you just chop down yeah i wouldn't use a tree you just
[03:32:03.560 --> 03:32:11.240]  talk yeah i chopped down a tree and then next year use it in my hugel bed my eye like a year after
[03:32:12.600 --> 03:32:18.200]  yeah let it let it go over a winter you know what i mean yeah i always wait a few years
[03:32:18.760 --> 03:32:24.520]  yeah like yeah especially i'll be going on if it's a giant tree you know you want to wait a
[03:32:24.840 --> 03:32:32.200]  long time with a giant yeah if you got small trees you know like we have in southern california
[03:32:32.200 --> 03:32:36.120]  you can what you can use those next year but like anywhere else that has like real trees you
[03:32:36.120 --> 03:32:39.880]  didn't you know you have to cut down and stuff yeah you might want to wait a couple years
[03:32:39.880 --> 03:32:45.800]  for or chop them into pieces so they break down quicker you know you know smaller chunks
[03:32:46.120 --> 03:32:56.040]  yeah but i don't really know i don't recommend you i mean i you know your pot was kind of upside
[03:32:56.040 --> 03:33:02.200]  down like the bottom of the pot needs to be on the top of the pot and the top of your pot needs
[03:33:02.200 --> 03:33:10.280]  to be on the bottom of your pot so i mean i i guess you could just flip it and like cover crop
[03:33:10.280 --> 03:33:16.520]  the top of it and you'd probably yeah but exactly i don't know by the time now you know
[03:33:16.520 --> 03:33:21.560]  are you defeating the purpose like it's already been how long do you say a year and a half or
[03:33:21.560 --> 03:33:26.760]  something it's been like this well it's interesting because like some of the stuff i had in there was
[03:33:26.760 --> 03:33:35.400]  asparagus so asparagus and year one it grew and then it started to yellow and die out and i was
[03:33:35.400 --> 03:33:45.480]  like uh like something's not right in this pot but then the asparagus came back and i'm in you
[03:33:45.480 --> 03:33:51.880]  know we're in southern california so it's like there's no dead season like it just right i
[03:33:51.880 --> 03:33:57.880]  don't even know like like i don't know plants like that where it's like in their natural environment
[03:33:57.880 --> 03:34:04.040]  where there are winters like this is what they do but in socal where it's never cold like
[03:34:05.480 --> 03:34:11.800]  they popped back up and then so but but in my head i'm like
[03:34:14.520 --> 03:34:20.120]  do i just dump these into a big bin and kind of like mix them up with other stuff and
[03:34:21.400 --> 03:34:26.040]  and if you're growing asparagus you don't you don't ever want to disturb that because that's
[03:34:26.040 --> 03:34:33.400]  your that's your asparagus so my my my other issue with the asparagus is every single one of them is
[03:34:33.400 --> 03:34:44.760]  male so so i need to sprout more asparagus and hope that i get how did you plant the asparagus
[03:34:44.760 --> 03:34:51.960]  you didn't buy crowns that were already like like a variety of edible asparagus you just planted
[03:34:51.960 --> 03:34:58.520]  them from seed okay so that's what kind of pot so it's like i've never seen i've never i've never
[03:34:58.520 --> 03:35:02.440]  ran into the problem where i had all male asparagus and i'm like yeah that's that's a
[03:35:02.440 --> 03:35:07.880]  hell of a problem so i always planted the you know the asparagus crowns or the roots and i have
[03:35:11.240 --> 03:35:16.440]  it would be like if you had 20 cannabis plants and every single one was male
[03:35:16.440 --> 03:35:23.800]  but like i have so much asparagus in three different and these are all grass roots like 30
[03:35:24.520 --> 03:35:32.840]  this winter and 65 gallon that i'm on the ground this winter go let remind me i'll bring you up
[03:35:32.840 --> 03:35:38.520]  some asparagus crowns or some like super high quality edible like dank ass asparagus right
[03:35:38.520 --> 03:35:43.240]  and then you will plant those next to the male ones we can breed those ones together you know
[03:35:43.240 --> 03:35:47.080]  what i mean and you can start your little asparagus breeding project and then you can
[03:35:47.080 --> 03:35:52.840]  kill your males and have your have your little female you know plant there hanging out you can
[03:35:52.840 --> 03:36:00.280]  grow every year after year but but it's a trippy i feel like asparagus is kind of potato like right
[03:36:02.360 --> 03:36:06.120]  well it's yeah it grows under the ground and then sends up the shoots and you eat the shoots as they
[03:36:06.120 --> 03:36:11.800]  come up yeah yeah and it'll die back down and then as the season comes unfolds it'll shoot back up
[03:36:11.800 --> 03:36:16.200]  but it takes a couple years i don't grow a lot of asparagus it's not like one of our favorite you
[03:36:16.200 --> 03:36:21.480]  know foods here so i don't spend a lot of time but i have i have some some experience growing it but
[03:36:21.480 --> 03:36:27.400]  it takes several years like three years you know four years where you really start getting something
[03:36:27.400 --> 03:36:33.160]  that you're that you're it's edible edible worthy you know what i mean that it takes a little time
[03:36:33.160 --> 03:36:37.480]  for that to develop and start getting to decent size to where you're going to eat it's like a
[03:36:37.480 --> 03:36:48.600]  peony kind of just kind of keeps coming back out is it a rhizome yeah yeah but it's trippy because
[03:36:48.600 --> 03:36:54.520]  in those same pots i'll like plant other stuff because you kind of forget the asparagus is in
[03:36:54.520 --> 03:37:00.840]  there and then suddenly like in in like 10 different places these shoots pot like
[03:37:01.400 --> 03:37:09.400]  threw anything out like it's a savage plant in the sense that it will fight for life
[03:37:10.920 --> 03:37:17.160]  right like no matter what's growing on top that thing will jackhammer through up
[03:37:17.880 --> 03:37:22.600]  its life is down below and it just shoots out those spears just to collect some energy you know
[03:37:22.600 --> 03:37:27.240]  it's like it and they're perfect spears you know or the females are anyway it's a cool plan
[03:37:27.240 --> 03:37:32.280]  they just shoot right through and they're ready to roll you know but yeah they're they're they're
[03:37:32.280 --> 03:37:36.840]  really aggressive and the longer and older they get the tougher they become you know and then you
[03:37:36.840 --> 03:37:41.080]  put something you want in there and you start watering it and feeding that and loving that
[03:37:41.080 --> 03:37:45.320]  and all of a sudden the asparagus is like fuck yeah boom jumped right through it you know what
[03:37:45.400 --> 03:37:49.800]  i mean it all gets excited you know happens to me with all kinds of stuff like i have ginger and
[03:37:49.800 --> 03:37:55.000]  stuff that it that happens to me all the time with you know it shows up and goes away and i
[03:37:55.000 --> 03:38:01.800]  can never get it all you know it's funny which area and honeysuckle do that for me yeah
[03:38:03.800 --> 03:38:09.960]  someone's asking about potato and i remember with you i like again in my head i was like
[03:38:09.960 --> 03:38:16.680]  eventually this stuff should see like it's flowering like seeds come next and with my
[03:38:16.680 --> 03:38:25.880]  sweet potato and and that just doesn't happen yeah sometimes you'll have a potato fruit it's really
[03:38:25.880 --> 03:38:32.280]  it's really rare uh and potato fruits like if it fruits like they're like they'll kill you so never
[03:38:32.280 --> 03:38:38.280]  ever ever eat a potato fruit looks like a little tomato thing it's a nice shade it will it'll
[03:38:38.360 --> 03:38:45.080]  fricken kill you so don't don't eat those those are bad for you uh straight up don't eat those
[03:38:45.080 --> 03:38:51.320]  i'm that it's rare that i see them actually form um i'm always digging up the potatoes and
[03:38:51.320 --> 03:38:56.040]  sometimes they'll flower and you don't get anything good pollination or whatever's happening but
[03:38:56.840 --> 03:39:04.280]  i have seen them form randomly here or there to know that holy cow what is this and then go through
[03:39:04.280 --> 03:39:07.880]  the channels of looking it up and learning about it you know and you figure out oh shit these
[03:39:07.880 --> 03:39:13.800]  things will kill you if you eat them so um but it doesn't happen i've seen them in the hedgerows
[03:39:14.520 --> 03:39:17.720]  i've seen them in the hedgerows where the potato fields have been cleared and potatoes have made
[03:39:17.720 --> 03:39:21.640]  it to the hedgerow and grown and during hunting season late in the year you see these odd beans
[03:39:21.640 --> 03:39:26.760]  and i'm trying to recall the name i was the farmer had a name for these things was somewhere along the
[03:39:26.760 --> 03:39:34.280]  line of the dead man's barrier some some name that you didn't fuck with yeah and you're i'll think of
[03:39:34.280 --> 03:39:40.280]  the name i'll tell you you'll get a kick out of it but that's you're right yeah yeah i i don't you
[03:39:40.280 --> 03:39:45.400]  don't see it all the time i don't know i don't know why you know you don't get them to set as
[03:39:45.400 --> 03:39:49.720]  much as like a tomato would because it's the same type of situation you know what i mean same family
[03:39:49.720 --> 03:39:54.520]  but it just grows differently but i have i have seen it happen you know i mean i've seen it happen
[03:39:54.520 --> 03:40:01.400]  um on a small scale you know here or there but don't eat them but what's interesting it goes
[03:40:01.400 --> 03:40:08.840]  under the ground but but it seems like potatoes and stuff like garlic do not really seed out
[03:40:11.160 --> 03:40:17.480]  and that i find interesting that like it it's like oh you want to grow like japanese
[03:40:19.000 --> 03:40:26.840]  sweet potato like you you don't buy seeds you you just like stick yeah you stick the potato
[03:40:26.840 --> 03:40:33.400]  in the ground yeah a hybridization thing like yeah exactly so like i think a wild potato would
[03:40:34.440 --> 03:40:40.280]  variety you know those are like commercial crops that have been steered in a way where they're not
[03:40:40.280 --> 03:40:45.320]  going to seed very well you know those potatoes the garlic all that stuff but if you grew some
[03:40:45.320 --> 03:40:49.240]  sort of an heirloom type variety that was that was meant to do that they would run through the
[03:40:50.040 --> 03:40:57.560]  like you know they should i believe that i believe so yeah yeah yeah um totally with a lot of things
[03:40:58.200 --> 03:41:04.280]  but i don't know i don't know enough about you know um like the potato flowering process you know
[03:41:04.920 --> 03:41:09.080]  that that i can that i can talk with you you know other than they're gonna kill you and it doesn't
[03:41:09.080 --> 03:41:14.280]  happen very easy but if you want to plant potatoes and the sweet potatoes and shit like that you know
[03:41:14.280 --> 03:41:19.720]  you always you always just you just plant the little you know the little the reject potatoes
[03:41:19.720 --> 03:41:24.040]  as the ones i always plant they turn into new plants or the ones you when you pull out your
[03:41:24.040 --> 03:41:28.200]  potato plant that you grew that year there's always a couple that you leave behind or that
[03:41:28.200 --> 03:41:32.840]  got broken and those ones will sprout back that next year but you can grow a potato from any
[03:41:32.840 --> 03:41:37.480]  potato even the ones in the store you just gotta wait them out a little while some some get sprayed
[03:41:37.480 --> 03:41:43.080]  with stuff to slow them down but you wash them off you wait them out they'll all root man they'll all
[03:41:43.080 --> 03:41:48.200]  throw some throw some eyes that you can plant you know and you don't need much of one so i've
[03:41:48.200 --> 03:41:54.760]  never worried about the seeds because i've always just planted the roots but i bet you heirloom
[03:41:54.760 --> 03:42:00.520]  varieties would seed and do that much easier or in bigger numbers with more pollination chances
[03:42:01.240 --> 03:42:08.840]  do they work like bulbs when they're potatoes yeah yeah so in other words do they even need to seed
[03:42:08.840 --> 03:42:15.400]  at that point no no yeah no yeah they reproduce that way they don't need to but they can't and
[03:42:15.400 --> 03:42:22.440]  and i don't know what makes that or doesn't but and and garlic's the same way right
[03:42:23.160 --> 03:42:29.960]  huh well it's like what about irises and stuff like i get pods on my irises but they also divide
[03:42:29.960 --> 03:42:35.960]  through right right now yep yep all right you can plant you can plant those those some of those
[03:42:35.960 --> 03:42:41.720]  speaking of which peter if you want some iris pods i have some iris pods yeah they're dry youtube
[03:42:41.720 --> 03:42:46.120]  mr trees they're dry they're beautiful purple irises they go back like 90 years in my family
[03:42:46.680 --> 03:42:50.920]  oh that's way cool yeah if there was any other like multiple colored irises and stuff and you
[03:42:50.920 --> 03:42:56.360]  have some different different pollination chances and stuff you know but i got some pink lilies that
[03:42:56.520 --> 03:42:57.800]  like 90 years old
[03:43:00.280 --> 03:43:03.560]  that's awesome and a hundred year 100 year old peony
[03:43:04.680 --> 03:43:09.640]  my i have the peonies and irises that both came out of my great-grandmother's garden
[03:43:09.640 --> 03:43:15.400]  and my irises my irises survived by accident on the edge of my pond they actually live in my pond
[03:43:15.400 --> 03:43:22.360]  like half water half out of the water yeah yeah that's cool yeah i got some water irises that
[03:43:22.360 --> 03:43:25.480]  are nearby and my little my little gangster pond
[03:43:31.000 --> 03:43:39.720]  yeah no i have uh like what was it you i can't remember whose ig i was looking at but uh
[03:43:39.720 --> 03:43:43.480]  do you have pop i know it was elka who has a ton of poppies uh
[03:43:43.560 --> 03:43:44.060]  uh
[03:43:51.080 --> 03:43:55.960]  but uh but i have like my poppies are finally flowering and then
[03:43:57.240 --> 03:44:07.000]  my hope is that they then seed out yeah but uh yeah bees love poppies man you see bees in there
[03:44:07.000 --> 03:44:13.960]  all the time causing a ruckus that's cool i haven't grown poppies in a long time you know
[03:44:13.960 --> 03:44:17.960]  but i've grown i've grown lots of poppies we grew lots of those funny ones we used to when i worked
[03:44:17.960 --> 03:44:22.760]  at the nursery we used to get cool ones from like botanical interest or something like the hungarian
[03:44:22.760 --> 03:44:29.880]  blues and um like there was a couple other ones i can't remember now but yeah some funny ones that
[03:44:29.880 --> 03:44:36.360]  were pretty cool back in the day well i have a i a couple people sent me different like uh afghani
[03:44:36.360 --> 03:44:41.880]  poppies yeah yeah so i want to basically seed them out and then give them out to other people
[03:44:42.680 --> 03:44:47.160]  did they come with names i mean did you get any particular names to them or they're just afghani
[03:44:47.160 --> 03:44:54.600]  poppies no i got uh yeah give me a second because there's all kinds of different varieties different
[03:44:54.600 --> 03:45:01.640]  colors different shades different you know cool stuff they're beautiful man really cool
[03:45:01.640 --> 03:45:06.600]  really cool plants i've got a lot of old ladies that i work for uh take care of the fruit trees
[03:45:06.600 --> 03:45:12.040]  and help them with their with their stuff and they got every year they'll have their little
[03:45:12.680 --> 03:45:19.240]  poppy situation going on you know what i mean it's just like the the just the understanding you know
[03:45:19.240 --> 03:45:24.280]  what i mean it's just nobody ever talks about it it's just it's just there you know it's pretty
[03:45:24.280 --> 03:45:30.440]  funny you know the other day i was at one of those old ladies places and we were she was her she
[03:45:30.440 --> 03:45:34.440]  called me because her avocados were having a hell of a time and i came out to see what was going on
[03:45:34.440 --> 03:45:42.040]  but really i found out she called me because um she had this giant she had two giant weed plants
[03:45:42.040 --> 03:45:47.480]  back there and she when i got there she's like tyler i don't know how this got here a bird must

[03:46:35.320 --> 03:46:41.720]  so i have my notes are stoker's blue odyssey mcfarlane smith peace somniferum
[03:46:42.920 --> 03:46:49.480]  um and then yeah happy verse arm nev and sorry venom is the yeah it's a botanical for the
[03:46:49.880 --> 03:46:55.240]  the papi ver happy there for the opium poppy type things the afghan poppy things

[03:47:04.920 --> 03:47:10.040]  yeah you're there's um they're totally legal to grow like you know you can grow them you know
[03:47:10.040 --> 03:47:14.920]  for flowers they grow wild in the you know all across like in places in new york and stuff i
[03:47:15.240 --> 03:47:19.720]  in new york and stuff i saw him when i was driving around with some wild stuff and it's wild it's it's
[03:47:19.720 --> 03:47:25.960]  a wild it's a wild thing you know they're everywhere and you don't really realize it you
[03:47:25.960 --> 03:47:32.200]  know what i mean it's like the science episode right where elaine gets like dinged on the drug test
[03:47:33.720 --> 03:47:36.840]  yeah the bagels right for the bagels
[03:47:39.400 --> 03:47:43.800]  i thought yeah people like failed drug tests when you're eating the seeds and the bread you know
[03:47:43.800 --> 03:47:49.160]  what i mean and stuff like that you know i've heard you know so i don't you know that's crazy
[03:47:49.160 --> 03:47:57.560]  stuff you know there's a whole seinfeld episode on it oh we've been revisiting all the seinfelds
[03:47:57.560 --> 03:48:01.480]  recently it's almost like a new show again but then it's like you can almost recite them when
[03:48:01.480 --> 03:48:08.760]  you watch them my wife loves seinfeld we were we were gonna put that put that back on but yeah
[03:48:08.760 --> 03:48:12.360]  that's exactly what happens you end up reciting them as you're watching them you know it's still
[03:48:12.360 --> 03:48:22.970]  fun as hell that's great that was real funny oh man that's real funny but yeah those growing out
[03:48:26.810 --> 03:48:29.770]  but i had like actually hold on let me find them
[03:48:32.170 --> 03:48:34.730]  yeah he's got to wait till springtime to plant any of those
[03:48:36.250 --> 03:48:40.330]  so those poppies will just get they won't grow real well right now so he's got to wait
[03:48:40.410 --> 03:48:50.010]  till springtime i think yeah those annuals yeah yeah annuals what do we got yeah nice
[03:48:51.370 --> 03:48:58.810]  so that's the garlic nice is that purple garlic or is that just browned i couldn't see
[03:48:59.690 --> 03:49:00.250]  blown up
[03:49:02.010 --> 03:49:07.690]  oh there you go ah fuck hold on i mean nice
[03:49:11.810 --> 03:49:18.130]  heck yeah it's got green still in there yeah they're still green and i i just cut these uh
[03:49:18.770 --> 03:49:22.930]  right on from hang them up get them get them hung up or something or lay them
[03:49:22.930 --> 03:49:24.530]  so they're not laying on top of each other
[03:49:25.490 --> 03:49:33.330]  sure put them in your drying tent yeah you need to put them on some screens or some hang
[03:49:33.330 --> 03:49:38.210]  hanging you gotta hang those garlics up a little bit and get a little line do garlic line
[03:49:40.050 --> 03:49:41.010]  my wife loves that
[03:49:43.330 --> 03:49:46.130]  and then i have this sorghum that's coming down right now
[03:49:48.210 --> 03:49:50.290]  nothing better than fresh garlic man i love that
[03:49:50.770 --> 03:49:52.690]  some of my favorite stuff to grow
[03:49:54.690 --> 03:50:01.210]  all right you can see that right the black seeds yeah yeah that's cool
[03:50:04.010 --> 03:50:11.690]  that's way cool you get a bunch of those so my confusion is like when you're looking it up
[03:50:11.690 --> 03:50:20.570]  on google it's like yeah you can't get garlic seed like like potatoes garlic like there are certain
[03:50:20.730 --> 03:50:27.450]  like there are certain things where it's like getting seeds is not it's still not easy yeah
[03:50:28.170 --> 03:50:34.650]  yeah yeah it's not it's like you know it's a silly it's a silly thing because you don't need
[03:50:34.650 --> 03:50:41.610]  the seed you know it's like so there's not a lot of time spent on on that side of it you know
[03:50:41.610 --> 03:50:47.210]  so you can't order those seeds it's hard right but so for me it like where my head's at is very
[03:50:47.290 --> 03:50:56.010]  different than your average it's like yeah i could buy like the the um the japanese sweet potato i
[03:50:56.010 --> 03:51:03.930]  have maybe three years ago i went to the farmer's market right before thanksgiving and i was gonna
[03:51:03.930 --> 03:51:12.250]  make a uh a sweet potato of rotten so i bought a ton of sweet potatoes from this japanese
[03:51:13.210 --> 03:51:23.210]  farmer and i used like 95 of them and then the ones i didn't use they just sat there and then
[03:51:23.210 --> 03:51:31.210]  finally like the shoots started coming out and i was like what do i do with you do i i i always
[03:51:31.210 --> 03:51:38.570]  feel bad when i kill shit like plants and i'm like i could put you in the composter but let me just
[03:51:38.570 --> 03:51:44.810]  plant you and you saw them like you came over and that that's what those were um
[03:51:47.050 --> 03:51:53.690]  and as a like layman i was like these will produce seeds and you were like yeah no that
[03:51:53.690 --> 03:52:02.170]  shit doesn't produce seeds i was like fuck no but you'll have like you'll have like like 20
[03:52:02.250 --> 03:52:08.570]  little sweet potatoes under the ground so you just take but we're again no no but where my
[03:52:08.570 --> 03:52:16.410]  head's at is like as i send stuff out to people i don't want to be like here's a big potato
[03:52:17.450 --> 03:52:23.050]  no yeah i'd rather be like here are little tiny seeds that fit in a padded envelope
[03:52:23.690 --> 03:52:29.370]  not like cory like what's up let me send you like a four pound sweet potato
[03:52:30.170 --> 03:52:35.610]  so you can also grow sweet potatoes i'd rather be like you could have some seeds
[03:52:37.530 --> 03:52:42.970]  so check this out i'm going to change the game a little bit on you right there's a there's like
[03:52:42.970 --> 03:52:49.450]  sweet potatoes and other potatoes are sold in slips and a slip is basically a clone you know
[03:52:49.450 --> 03:52:54.650]  of potato right so like you can just break off a piece of any living sweet potato right if you do
[03:52:55.610 --> 03:53:00.570]  fucking roots like like a son of a bitch so you can just get a little basil thing a little clone
[03:53:00.570 --> 03:53:05.370]  basil thing and stuff two little things and sell slips instead of seeds or give a slip instead of
[03:53:05.370 --> 03:53:11.290]  a seat and it's less than a potato all the way so so for me i'm kind of like what's it like if it
[03:53:11.290 --> 03:53:18.970]  were comfrey i'd be like here's a piece of the root and by the way don't ever put this anywhere
[03:53:18.970 --> 03:53:27.130]  in your garden where do you put it forever because my comfrey that i like tried to kill
[03:53:27.130 --> 03:53:35.370]  and slice into like thousands of little slices is now in like 50 different little pots
[03:53:36.250 --> 03:53:43.930]  shooting up non-stop and then when you try to pull it out like if you don't get that if you
[03:53:43.930 --> 03:53:51.050]  don't get it all the way down to that little piece of root it's just gonna shoot back up like
[03:53:51.050 --> 03:54:00.970]  four days later yeah and like i have it like i have weed that i'm growing that i try to dig down
[03:54:00.970 --> 03:54:07.370]  with my fingers but i'm like fuck it i want to like rip the roots of the other plant that i do
[03:54:07.370 --> 03:54:12.970]  want bring it somewhere else and it doesn't matter what you get what you pull out because it has this
[03:54:13.050 --> 03:54:17.530]  giant taproot that goes down deep and like no matter where you break it off it's like it's
[03:54:17.530 --> 03:54:22.170]  gonna break out the chunk of itself it's gonna just keep coming but it's not just a taproot
[03:54:22.170 --> 03:54:31.850]  imagine if you which i did i grew probably 20 or 30 comfrey plants and then once i finished
[03:54:31.850 --> 03:54:40.970]  growing them for seed i would have told them i then like dumped them all into bigger bins and
[03:54:40.970 --> 03:54:47.770]  tried to like chop up the root like like you're dicing like like cucumber like
[03:54:49.290 --> 03:54:57.290]  right and every one of those cucumber slices which then i like put into other pots for new stuff
[03:54:58.490 --> 03:55:06.330]  it's comfrey that's just shooting up everywhere yeah and it it's it was it's been my worst mistake
[03:55:06.330 --> 03:55:17.450]  ever it's the only plant i've ever seen that has been that tenacious in being like i will survive
[03:55:18.010 --> 03:55:24.490]  that's awesome yeah that's awesome they got they got varieties they don't don't grow with quite as
[03:55:25.050 --> 03:55:33.530]  bigger which which doesn't seed and yeah but in my head i was like
[03:55:33.530 --> 03:55:45.190]  like like baki i was i was thinking it'd be a good thing like send out comfrey seeds like
[03:55:46.150 --> 03:55:52.870]  it it's it's very it's like nutrient dense right like it's super yeah it's job is to send send
[03:55:52.870 --> 03:55:57.350]  down the you know and chase the fallen minerals that are going the calciums and the heavier
[03:55:57.350 --> 03:56:02.470]  minerals it brings all that stuff back up and you know gives you great stuff to throw in your
[03:56:02.470 --> 03:56:08.950]  compost or feed your worms man that's good stuff but the the downside is that it is
[03:56:10.790 --> 03:56:17.750]  yeah it it does not die unkillable like anything i've been able to successfully pull out
[03:56:18.710 --> 03:56:28.310]  i've put in kind of my like dark navy blue bins and they just it just bakes in the sun so my hope
[03:56:28.390 --> 03:56:38.470]  is that any comfrey roots yeah are just like dried out like uh some eucalyptus in there
[03:56:39.910 --> 03:56:43.350]  that's my next move the eucalyptus i'm gonna mix the comfrey with the eucalyptus
[03:56:46.310 --> 03:56:50.470]  that was good but i i i can't get rid of it
[03:56:52.550 --> 03:56:56.790]  no it's it's crazy it's a few good plants like that man and it's like
[03:56:56.790 --> 03:57:00.950]  the plants that you can't get rid of they're telling you something you need to find you need
[03:57:00.950 --> 03:57:06.230]  to find a way to use them you know it's free it's free it's free energy it's free money it's free
[03:57:06.790 --> 03:57:12.950]  food it's free something you know what i mean so i try to always like with those plants i can't kill
[03:57:12.950 --> 03:57:17.030]  i'm always like all right all right we're gonna work together somehow you know and i find a use
[03:57:17.030 --> 03:57:22.950]  for it because it always helps me out you know i like plants like that but you're stuck you know
[03:57:23.910 --> 03:57:28.710]  all the pots and all that other stuff yeah i mean it's you know you don't have a lot of space for
[03:57:28.710 --> 03:57:33.990]  anything else so putting comfrey everywhere might be a problem you don't have compost
[03:57:33.990 --> 03:57:37.670]  piles like big ones you know that you can like throw it straight to the compost pile
[03:57:38.790 --> 03:57:48.550]  yeah the crate is super good even that like when i finally successfully pull it out
[03:57:48.550 --> 03:57:55.510]  like and get all of it i don't want to put it in my composter because i'm like i feel like this
[03:57:55.510 --> 03:58:02.950]  thing's gonna fucking survive it's gonna be like i'm still not dying so so that's why i'm drying
[03:58:02.950 --> 03:58:09.910]  them all out like as much as i i it's the only thing i can think of i need to set you up with
[03:58:09.910 --> 03:58:15.830]  some worms you blend that stuff up you know put it in a blender and then feed it to your worms man
[03:58:15.910 --> 03:58:23.830]  you know i have worms you know but if i have worms but if you're telling me that like i now need to
[03:58:23.830 --> 03:58:34.630]  like put it in a blender i'm just like this shit is it's like it's like uh in terminator 2 whoever
[03:58:34.630 --> 03:58:40.710]  the bad terminator was like that dude just did not fucking die like he was metal and you would
[03:58:41.670 --> 03:58:50.710]  them into like a thousand metal like blobs and those blobs would somehow each live form another
[03:58:50.710 --> 03:58:59.590]  one yeah it just magnetically came back together it was the bomb like mercury yeah right so that's
[03:59:00.390 --> 03:59:07.270]  anyway that's it's like it's like comfrey in la it's like i've learned that like like just
[03:59:08.230 --> 03:59:17.110]  as you first deal with the plants like you have no idea what it does asparagus like it first shot
[03:59:17.110 --> 03:59:25.910]  up and then it all died and i was like uh like i like i guess i don't know how to grow asparagus
[03:59:25.910 --> 03:59:35.270]  and it's like oh no like it's not in season one that it does it it like it's like it's in season
[03:59:35.270 --> 03:59:41.430]  two and three yeah and then it was like season two i was like oh they're coming back and it was
[03:59:41.430 --> 03:59:48.150]  like all male and i was like fuck like all right but but i'm learning and then like comfrey track
[03:59:48.150 --> 03:59:56.390]  two it was the same thing where it was like don't plant more comfrey like that that's my takeaway is
[03:59:56.390 --> 04:00:04.950]  like do not let the comfrey or like if you plant it contain it like you contain mint like
[04:00:04.950 --> 04:00:12.870]  don't let those roots run wild yes potatoes it's like you can't you it's almost impossible to
[04:00:12.870 --> 04:00:22.230]  create seeds from from potatoes and it's not fun yeah so you guys thanks for coming along
[04:00:22.230 --> 04:00:26.950]  i gotta dip out of here and go to sleep before i fall asleep on you guys well why don't why don't
