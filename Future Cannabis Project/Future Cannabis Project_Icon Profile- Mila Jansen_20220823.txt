[00:13.500 --> 00:18.500]  And welcome to another episode of the Friendly Cannabis Show.
[00:20.840 --> 00:23.600]  Hello, very nice to see you.
[00:23.600 --> 00:25.400]  Yes, thank you for joining us.
[00:25.400 --> 00:27.960]  Today's guest, we have Mila Janssen,
[00:27.960 --> 00:30.600]  also known as the Hash Queen.
[00:30.600 --> 00:33.880]  One heck of a fascinating person.
[00:33.880 --> 00:35.720]  You have done a lot.
[00:35.720 --> 00:39.160]  You have traveled a lot and you have seen a lot.
[00:39.160 --> 00:43.580]  So I know for myself and for a lot of people watching
[00:43.580 --> 00:46.420]  that have benefited from your innovations
[00:46.420 --> 00:49.240]  and determination, thank you.
[00:49.240 --> 00:50.600]  We're happy to have you here today.
[00:50.600 --> 00:52.320]  It's an honor to speak with you.
[00:53.700 --> 00:56.080]  It's wonderful to be speaking to you.
[00:56.980 --> 00:58.480]  Yes, thank you.
[00:58.480 --> 01:03.200]  And I appreciate earlier letting me try to practice
[01:03.200 --> 01:06.180]  the small amount of Dutch that I know.
[01:06.180 --> 01:08.940]  I'll probably slip a few more in here
[01:09.720 --> 01:11.520]  as we go along, I'll try.
[01:13.460 --> 01:17.760]  But let's start, we're not gonna go all the way back
[01:17.760 --> 01:18.980]  to the beginning right now.
[01:18.980 --> 01:22.100]  I definitely would like to know more later,
[01:22.100 --> 01:27.020]  but let's start at the defining moment.
[01:27.020 --> 01:31.720]  I believe it was back in 1994 when you came up
[01:31.720 --> 01:34.580]  with the concept of the pollinator.
[01:34.580 --> 01:36.940]  Now this has changed all of our lives.
[01:36.940 --> 01:40.780]  So can you maybe tell us a little bit about that moment
[01:40.780 --> 01:43.700]  and also what is the pollinator?
[01:45.780 --> 01:48.980]  To tell you the story started that I was living
[01:48.980 --> 01:52.700]  in India at that time for 14 years.
[01:52.700 --> 01:56.420]  And in 88, I came back to Amsterdam,
[01:56.420 --> 01:59.220]  which was suddenly filled with coffee shops.
[01:59.220 --> 02:02.340]  They didn't exist when I left in 68.
[02:02.340 --> 02:04.340]  There were no coffee shops then.
[02:04.340 --> 02:09.100]  So, and most of these coffee shops sold weed.
[02:09.100 --> 02:11.420]  And I'd never run into weed.
[02:11.420 --> 02:15.120]  In India, people don't smoke weed up in the north.
[02:15.120 --> 02:19.260]  In Pakistan, Afghanistan, people don't smoke weed.
[02:19.260 --> 02:22.780]  And anyway, I didn't like it so much.
[02:23.700 --> 02:27.660]  I was growing at that time in the beginning 90s,
[02:27.660 --> 02:30.500]  supporting four kids and having learned
[02:30.500 --> 02:34.260]  in all these countries, Pakistan, Afghanistan,
[02:35.160 --> 02:37.820]  Northern India, Nepal, how people make hash.
[02:37.820 --> 02:39.060]  I had the material.
[02:39.060 --> 02:43.140]  So I went and did it and I got a flat screen
[02:43.140 --> 02:47.900]  and I would spend time to kind of waffle
[02:47.900 --> 02:50.420]  the material over that and slowly, slowly,
[02:50.420 --> 02:53.420]  the crystals would fall through the screen.
[02:54.500 --> 02:56.940]  And then one night I was standing in front
[02:56.940 --> 03:00.300]  of my clothes dryer where the clothes are drying,
[03:00.300 --> 03:03.060]  they're tumbling around all over the place.
[03:03.060 --> 03:04.460]  And I suddenly thought,
[03:04.460 --> 03:08.380]  man, it looks pretty much like what I'm doing, small size.
[03:08.380 --> 03:13.380]  So the next day we got a secondhand clothes dryer,
[03:13.380 --> 03:15.700]  ripped out the heat and I think we just tied
[03:15.700 --> 03:20.100]  a piece of screen around the drum to see if it would work.
[03:20.100 --> 03:25.100]  Put a bunch of material in and yes, the crystals fell down,
[03:25.660 --> 03:27.540]  especially later when we realized
[03:27.540 --> 03:31.740]  the environment should be colder, that that really helps.
[03:31.740 --> 03:35.580]  But right from the word go, the crystals fell down faster
[03:35.580 --> 03:37.460]  than I could do it by hand.
[03:37.460 --> 03:40.420]  Instead of half an hour to work for one joint,
[03:40.420 --> 03:42.060]  it was there in five minutes.
[03:43.820 --> 03:48.100]  So it was basically an invention
[03:48.100 --> 03:51.860]  for my personal needs and desires.
[03:53.980 --> 03:58.580]  Then we started producing some and Robert Clark,
[03:58.620 --> 04:00.620]  he unveiled the first one.
[04:01.900 --> 04:04.180]  A lot of people were there at that time.
[04:05.900 --> 04:07.660]  It took off from there.
[04:07.660 --> 04:10.620]  I used to make them, we'd manufacture a couple
[04:10.620 --> 04:14.180]  and go off to Dutch grow shops and say,
[04:14.180 --> 04:16.660]  have some old trim lying around
[04:16.660 --> 04:20.140]  and we'll show you something.
[04:20.140 --> 04:23.060]  And while we're all having coffee, we would show them.
[04:23.060 --> 04:24.420]  And I would be amazed, I mean,
[04:24.460 --> 04:26.860]  they wouldn't usually sell the model, right?
[04:29.660 --> 04:33.460]  They wouldn't let you leave the shop with it.
[04:33.460 --> 04:35.340]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[04:35.340 --> 04:39.420]  So that was the beginning of the Pollinator Company
[04:39.420 --> 04:41.660]  and actually to call it the Pollinator
[04:41.660 --> 04:46.140]  is a bit of a misnomer, but anyway, such it is.
[04:46.140 --> 04:49.660]  So what it consists of, instead of a flat screen,
[04:49.660 --> 04:52.060]  it has a round screen like a drum
[04:52.100 --> 04:55.540]  and it's only tumbles around and the material
[04:56.620 --> 04:59.780]  waffles around and knocks off each other's crystals.
[04:59.780 --> 05:01.100]  They fall through the screen
[05:01.100 --> 05:03.580]  and you can collect them at the bottom.
[05:03.580 --> 05:07.660]  And that was actually the very first mechanical system
[05:07.660 --> 05:12.220]  to separate from the plant material.
[05:14.460 --> 05:16.660]  And let's see, I can actually pull a picture
[05:16.660 --> 05:21.020]  of the Pollinator up here on the other screen real quickly.
[05:22.500 --> 05:24.100]  It must've been funny though,
[05:24.100 --> 05:28.900]  explaining to whoever helped you pick up this used dryer,
[05:28.900 --> 05:30.540]  what you wanted to do with it.
[05:30.540 --> 05:33.340]  Did they give you a funny look when you explained,
[05:33.340 --> 05:35.780]  okay, we're gonna take out the heating
[05:35.780 --> 05:37.220]  and I'm putting in a screen.
[05:38.860 --> 05:42.780]  No, just the design, we didn't go into the details.
[05:42.780 --> 05:44.100]  It's not clear.
[05:45.740 --> 05:48.740]  No, whether it be even more heating.
[05:49.580 --> 05:53.700]  Yep, now let's see here.
[05:53.700 --> 05:58.700]  Here's a picture of the P500 and there's a variety of them.
[06:00.580 --> 06:03.380]  We're having a little bit of an audio issue.
[06:04.380 --> 06:09.380]  It might help if you come out and then come back in,
[06:11.580 --> 06:13.200]  if you can hear me well.
[06:14.780 --> 06:17.540]  Let's see here, but this is the P500.
[06:17.620 --> 06:22.620]  And as everybody can see, it has the round disc spins here
[06:23.980 --> 06:28.900]  and it has some trays here to collect all of the pollen
[06:28.900 --> 06:30.940]  or the trichome heads.
[06:33.140 --> 06:37.000]  Oh, let's see, I am unable to hear you Mila.
[06:38.540 --> 06:43.540]  Let's see here, let me take this and stop it.
[06:43.740 --> 06:47.140]  Okay, and so we're back to just me and you.
[06:48.700 --> 06:50.240]  Are you able to hear me?
[06:53.200 --> 06:54.180]  Oh, darn.
[06:55.680 --> 06:58.600]  I'm unable to hear you at the moment.
[06:58.600 --> 07:03.600]  It might help if you exit and then come back in
[07:04.360 --> 07:07.540]  using the same link that we had sent you.
[07:07.540 --> 07:10.380]  For some reason, I just don't hear you
[07:10.380 --> 07:12.600]  and it doesn't appear that you're muted.
[07:15.320 --> 07:18.240]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
[07:18.240 --> 07:21.240]  knows how to communicate, very clear.
[07:21.240 --> 07:22.900]  Yes, this is great.
[07:24.280 --> 07:28.360]  There's, you know, that's the international language too,
[07:28.360 --> 07:30.200]  two fingers to your lips.
[07:31.840 --> 07:34.240]  We may, you don't even have to hear each other,
[07:34.240 --> 07:37.480]  but we know what that stands for.
[07:37.480 --> 07:40.920]  So let's see here, let's make sure I've got audio on my end.
[07:40.920 --> 07:44.440]  Looks like I'm turned up, so I should hear something,
[07:44.440 --> 07:47.400]  but I don't hear anything.
[08:00.160 --> 08:02.800]  Looks like a fun conversation over there.
[08:02.800 --> 08:07.800]  I can't hear it though, unable to get any audio.
[08:08.320 --> 08:11.960]  Let's see, chat, are you hearing both sides
[08:11.960 --> 08:14.040]  of this conversation or are you hearing
[08:14.040 --> 08:15.800]  just one side of this conversation?
[08:15.800 --> 08:17.480]  Chat, let me know.
[08:17.700 --> 08:19.440]  No sound from Mila.
[08:19.440 --> 08:24.440]  Okay, so let's try leaving.
[08:27.880 --> 08:32.880]  There should be a red X there, it'll say leave studio.
[08:34.640 --> 08:41.700]  And then if you leave the studio,
[08:41.700 --> 08:43.980]  you should be able to come back
[08:43.980 --> 08:46.660]  using the same link we sent you before.
[08:46.780 --> 08:48.540]  Okay, perfect.
[08:48.540 --> 08:53.540]  And then it might, well, actually, they disconnected.
[08:53.580 --> 08:54.980]  They're probably not gonna hear me anymore.
[08:54.980 --> 08:57.340]  So we'll wait till they come back.
[08:57.340 --> 08:58.980]  But hey, everybody in chat,
[08:58.980 --> 09:01.980]  thank you for showing up very, very much.
[09:01.980 --> 09:03.420]  I see the rocks in here.
[09:03.420 --> 09:07.100]  We got alcoholic, Jordy Beans, radical cannabis,
[09:07.100 --> 09:11.700]  direct 710 connoisseur, ginger bug, tall,
[09:11.700 --> 09:14.740]  er, for the one, for the one, for the one.
[09:14.740 --> 09:19.540]  Ginger bug, tall, er, 420, Hawaii sustainable,
[09:19.540 --> 09:22.380]  shadow Mick, Robert, white paper, green fingers.
[09:22.380 --> 09:25.940]  Let's add Mila back to the screen.
[09:25.940 --> 09:26.780]  I hear you.
[09:26.780 --> 09:27.620]  Can you hear us?
[09:27.620 --> 09:30.340]  Yes, yes, I do.
[09:30.340 --> 09:31.420]  You can hear us.
[09:31.420 --> 09:32.860]  Yes, I do.
[09:32.860 --> 09:34.200]  Are you hearing me now?
[09:35.300 --> 09:37.060]  But we can't hear you.
[09:37.060 --> 09:39.340]  Oh boy, okay.
[09:39.340 --> 09:40.180]  Let's see.
[09:42.020 --> 09:45.700]  I do hear you, but I can't hear you.
[09:45.700 --> 09:47.740]  Now I can hear you.
[09:47.740 --> 09:49.580]  Excellent, thank you.
[09:51.180 --> 09:53.980]  Hey, no, no problem at all.
[09:53.980 --> 09:57.400]  You would be amazed with the amount of technical issues
[09:57.400 --> 10:00.420]  that can arise doing this routinely.
[10:00.420 --> 10:04.420]  So I'm just happy you made it today.
[10:04.420 --> 10:05.600]  So thank you.
[10:05.640 --> 10:09.600]  What we were talking about is we were,
[10:09.600 --> 10:12.840]  I was showing a picture here of the pollinator
[10:12.840 --> 10:17.320]  and you said you were kind of, you kept it a little quiet.
[10:17.320 --> 10:20.800]  You didn't tell the person you were having help pick up
[10:20.800 --> 10:25.180]  the dryer exactly what was going on.
[10:26.800 --> 10:29.000]  You wouldn't have understood it.
[10:29.000 --> 10:34.000]  Right, well, and you said you made it for personal use.
[10:34.760 --> 10:38.440]  Originally, and it seems to be, you know,
[10:38.440 --> 10:43.440]  necessity is the best, you know, motivation for invention
[10:44.400 --> 10:48.040]  because you saw a way to do it better.
[10:48.040 --> 10:51.040]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, and taking less time.
[10:51.040 --> 10:53.260]  Well, I think it's putting two things
[10:53.260 --> 10:56.240]  out of different worlds and match them together
[10:56.240 --> 10:58.500]  and then you get something new.
[10:58.580 --> 11:03.580]  Yeah, yeah, and you know, education to that front
[11:04.420 --> 11:07.860]  is important because there's a lot of things
[11:07.860 --> 11:11.820]  that apply from other areas or other industries
[11:11.820 --> 11:13.420]  to what we do.
[11:13.420 --> 11:17.060]  Yeah, and then later I invented the bags.
[11:17.060 --> 11:19.500]  I sewed the first one myself
[11:19.500 --> 11:22.100]  and afterwards came the washing machine.
[11:22.100 --> 11:25.220]  And like most of my things, first the dryer
[11:25.220 --> 11:26.940]  and then the washing machine,
[11:26.980 --> 11:29.060]  but the washing machine works great.
[11:29.060 --> 11:32.220]  It was designed to get your dirty socks clean.
[11:32.220 --> 11:34.300]  And according to the washing machine,
[11:34.300 --> 11:36.580]  those trichomes are the dirt
[11:36.580 --> 11:39.900]  and it's been professionally designed to get rid of them.
[11:39.900 --> 11:43.220]  So they all float around in the runoff water
[11:43.220 --> 11:45.740]  and then you just put that through some bags
[11:45.740 --> 11:48.520]  and catch the trichomes that way.
[11:51.780 --> 11:55.140]  Yeah, let's talk about the bags real quick
[11:55.140 --> 11:58.780]  because I like, and here's a quick,
[11:58.780 --> 12:02.340]  the bubble later is the washing machine here.
[12:02.340 --> 12:03.600]  A couple that you have.
[12:05.180 --> 12:09.300]  And I'll get, I wanna ask about those in a second as well,
[12:09.300 --> 12:12.020]  but I have a bunch of trim laying around
[12:12.020 --> 12:17.020]  and there are different sizes of the screens for the bags.
[12:19.500 --> 12:24.380]  Some sets have three bags, some sets have eight bags.
[12:24.500 --> 12:29.340]  Do you have a preference of the number of screens you use?
[12:30.500 --> 12:32.020]  Well, it really depends.
[12:32.020 --> 12:36.500]  If you just wanna get some nice stuff for yourself,
[12:36.500 --> 12:38.700]  three bags is all you need.
[12:38.700 --> 12:41.860]  Now let's say you want to enter a competition
[12:41.860 --> 12:44.940]  and you want to make really the best of the best.
[12:44.940 --> 12:47.780]  Yeah, then I would say get some more bags.
[12:47.780 --> 12:49.580]  But if you get the three bag set,
[12:49.580 --> 12:52.460]  basically there's one to hold the material
[12:52.460 --> 12:53.980]  and one for the big crystals
[12:53.980 --> 12:56.060]  and one for the small crystals.
[12:56.060 --> 12:58.720]  Yeah, and you can divide those two piles
[12:58.720 --> 13:03.720]  into six different piles of different gradients of screen.
[13:04.100 --> 13:07.620]  But unless it's a competition, yeah, I don't know.
[13:07.620 --> 13:09.140]  Personally, I don't bother.
[13:09.140 --> 13:11.980]  I just use the three bag set mainly.
[13:13.220 --> 13:17.640]  And when it's competition level, Hash,
[13:18.500 --> 13:19.860]  what are you looking at?
[13:19.860 --> 13:22.100]  Is it just purely trichome heads
[13:22.740 --> 13:24.860]  or are there still maybe some stocks in there?
[13:24.860 --> 13:27.900]  Is that what makes the more bags better
[13:27.900 --> 13:30.780]  or is it just a particular size you're after?
[13:30.780 --> 13:31.900]  Yeah, that can be.
[13:31.900 --> 13:34.980]  And of course you're after large trichomes.
[13:34.980 --> 13:39.980]  Each trichome contains percentage-wise much more oil
[13:40.620 --> 13:43.460]  than a lot of little trichomes.
[13:43.460 --> 13:46.860]  They all have a thin layer of cellulose around them.
[13:46.860 --> 13:49.800]  And I prefer the big trichomes.
[13:50.640 --> 13:54.600]  Yeah, ideally it looks like caviar.
[13:54.600 --> 13:56.960]  There's no little stocks in there.
[13:56.960 --> 13:59.040]  There's nothing else in there.
[13:59.040 --> 14:01.700]  There's just trichomes, yeah.
[14:04.360 --> 14:07.020]  Definitely, when it melts on you,
[14:07.020 --> 14:09.540]  that is a nice sight to see.
[14:11.000 --> 14:15.140]  Also, I would like to mention that if people are really,
[14:16.100 --> 14:20.620]  one of their main things is the taste and the aroma,
[14:20.620 --> 14:24.100]  then I would advise to use the pollinator
[14:24.100 --> 14:28.060]  because it does all the aromas and flavors still in there.
[14:28.060 --> 14:30.740]  Once you put it through the ice water,
[14:31.900 --> 14:34.100]  probably I think some of the terpenes
[14:34.100 --> 14:37.100]  are maybe on the outside and they get washed off.
[14:37.100 --> 14:40.940]  Anyway, in general, Isolated Hash has less taste
[14:41.020 --> 14:44.920]  and less aroma, but it's a hell of a stronger.
[14:46.220 --> 14:47.980]  I prefer it actually.
[14:50.100 --> 14:53.180]  Well, you had mentioned earlier
[14:53.180 --> 14:57.220]  that flour wasn't really consumed in India where you were.
[14:57.220 --> 14:59.980]  It was really about the trichomes, the hash.
[14:59.980 --> 15:04.140]  Do you often mix your hash with cannabis flour
[15:04.140 --> 15:07.360]  or do you like to use a tobacco or a substitute?
[15:07.800 --> 15:11.400]  I use, nowadays I use less than
[15:12.400 --> 15:15.200]  two grams of tobacco in a day.
[15:15.200 --> 15:17.000]  So that's less than two cigarettes
[15:17.000 --> 15:19.280]  and I make 10 little joints out of it
[15:19.280 --> 15:21.120]  and that keeps me happy.
[15:21.120 --> 15:25.260]  And actually since yesterday, I ran into some people
[15:25.260 --> 15:27.720]  who make these carbon filters
[15:27.720 --> 15:30.120]  because I've been coughing a bit lately.
[15:30.120 --> 15:33.920]  So all of today I've been using these carbon filters.
[15:33.920 --> 15:36.160]  Let's see if I start coughing less.
[15:36.200 --> 15:38.520]  That would be a big advantage.
[15:38.520 --> 15:41.960]  Yes, that would be definitely.
[15:46.680 --> 15:48.680]  I have so many places I can jump to.
[15:49.720 --> 15:53.680]  We're talking about preservation there of the terpenes,
[15:53.680 --> 15:58.560]  the flavonoids, that for a lot of concentrate makers
[15:58.560 --> 16:01.960]  in the US, that seems to be the biggest point
[16:01.960 --> 16:05.080]  because there's a lot of strength across the board.
[16:05.080 --> 16:08.160]  But is there something else you could do
[16:08.160 --> 16:10.720]  whether it's using the pollinator
[16:10.720 --> 16:15.480]  or maybe a growing practice or even just curing your hash
[16:15.480 --> 16:20.440]  that will help preserve any of the terpenes or flavonoids?
[16:21.840 --> 16:25.880]  Well, you're nearly starting to get on the edge
[16:25.880 --> 16:29.300]  of what got all discovered after.
[16:30.200 --> 16:34.440]  Like after the whole hash making went through a tremendous
[16:35.200 --> 16:39.160]  evolution and you started getting things like shatter
[16:39.160 --> 16:44.040]  and sauce and all these different solventless concentrates.
[16:44.040 --> 16:47.280]  And I must say it's a little bit beyond me.
[16:47.280 --> 16:51.680]  In Europe and Amsterdam, most of the hash that gets sold
[16:51.680 --> 16:54.760]  in the coffee shop is still old style hash
[16:54.760 --> 16:57.120]  coming from Morocco, coming.
[16:57.120 --> 16:59.520]  Well, nowadays, of course, it's more difficult
[16:59.520 --> 17:01.800]  from Nepal and Kashmir.
[17:01.800 --> 17:04.160]  But when people can travel normally,
[17:04.160 --> 17:07.640]  there's usually those varieties as well.
[17:07.640 --> 17:12.640]  And actually in Dutch law, the concentrates are illegal.
[17:14.520 --> 17:17.280]  Now, rosin technically should be legal
[17:17.280 --> 17:21.400]  because only some heat got applied.
[17:22.360 --> 17:24.280]  They don't like any mixing.
[17:24.280 --> 17:29.280]  So the concentrates they make now that are without solvents
[17:29.280 --> 17:30.640]  technically should be legal.
[17:30.640 --> 17:33.520]  But if you happen to be lucky enough
[17:33.520 --> 17:36.280]  to have a Dutch coffee shop license,
[17:36.280 --> 17:38.320]  you don't want the risk of losing it.
[17:39.560 --> 17:41.840]  No, no.
[17:41.840 --> 17:44.640]  And actually, as we traveled around the country,
[17:44.640 --> 17:46.480]  like in Amsterdam, it was fine.
[17:46.480 --> 17:48.360]  But as we traveled around the country,
[17:48.360 --> 17:52.240]  many of the coffee shops are no longer smoking in there
[17:52.240 --> 17:54.240]  because of the tobacco laws.
[17:54.240 --> 17:56.640]  There's no tobacco in the country.
[17:56.760 --> 17:57.840]  Tobacco laws.
[17:58.760 --> 18:00.280]  There's no tobacco indoors
[18:00.280 --> 18:02.800]  and a lot of them don't want to risk it.
[18:02.800 --> 18:06.160]  There was, you know, there were a few we could smoke in.
[18:06.160 --> 18:09.400]  Some of them will supply you with this herbal mix,
[18:09.400 --> 18:11.560]  which is terrible.
[18:11.560 --> 18:13.320]  Yeah, we did not try that.
[18:14.400 --> 18:15.240]  Now, let's see.
[18:15.240 --> 18:17.160]  Let me try some Dutch here.
[18:17.160 --> 18:20.720]  So tobacco and hash, is it wheat?
[18:20.720 --> 18:23.280]  Like W-E-I-T, is that?
[18:23.280 --> 18:25.800]  No, wheat is grass.
[18:25.880 --> 18:26.720]  Okay.
[18:27.840 --> 18:29.120]  Okay.
[18:29.120 --> 18:31.160]  Hash and tobacco.
[18:31.160 --> 18:32.720]  That's hash and tobacco.
[18:33.720 --> 18:36.600]  I must say, I started smoking here in Amsterdam
[18:36.600 --> 18:40.840]  in the winter of 64, 65,
[18:40.840 --> 18:42.680]  when there was no coffee shops
[18:42.680 --> 18:45.040]  and there was no wheat in the whole city.
[18:45.040 --> 18:47.360]  You kind of had to go down to the bars
[18:47.360 --> 18:50.400]  around the red light harbor area.
[18:50.400 --> 18:51.880]  And then some of those guys
[18:51.880 --> 18:54.520]  would have connections with sailors.
[18:54.520 --> 18:58.400]  And that's how you could get some Lebanese sometime
[18:58.400 --> 19:02.600]  or a Turkish and yeah.
[19:02.600 --> 19:03.440]  Yep.
[19:03.440 --> 19:07.640]  And that honestly is a highlight of me and my wife
[19:07.640 --> 19:10.200]  when we travel there is to experience that hash.
[19:10.200 --> 19:11.040]  It's funny.
[19:11.040 --> 19:13.400]  It's like, and good white widow.
[19:13.400 --> 19:18.400]  Some things in that area are just seemingly so commonplace.
[19:18.800 --> 19:22.240]  They're not as appreciated as someone here
[19:22.240 --> 19:23.960]  who doesn't have it.
[19:24.400 --> 19:25.480]  But the grass is always greener
[19:25.480 --> 19:28.120]  because we have concentrates.
[19:28.120 --> 19:30.440]  And from what I hear many people over there,
[19:30.440 --> 19:32.640]  they just ask me all about the concentrates.
[19:32.640 --> 19:33.480]  Yeah.
[19:33.480 --> 19:34.320]  Yeah.
[19:34.320 --> 19:35.160]  Yeah.
[19:35.160 --> 19:36.000]  Yeah.
[19:36.000 --> 19:41.000]  Is there any, because I personally, I'm a flower person,
[19:41.160 --> 19:43.760]  but I also like, you know, my dry sift.
[19:43.760 --> 19:46.920]  And then also lately have been doing the bubble hash.
[19:47.920 --> 19:51.600]  Is there a preferred method for storage
[19:52.000 --> 19:57.000]  or like a preferred length of time you want to store it
[19:57.120 --> 19:59.880]  before you actually start getting into it?
[19:59.880 --> 20:01.600]  Does it get better as it ages?
[20:02.760 --> 20:07.760]  Well, as it gets better, as it ages, actually,
[20:07.920 --> 20:12.920]  I think the CBD becomes more gains in strength.
[20:13.800 --> 20:17.920]  So I find what ages is more calming,
[20:18.760 --> 20:23.760]  maybe not as up there as it was in the beginning.
[20:24.600 --> 20:28.920]  And I must say, I never really had so much
[20:28.920 --> 20:30.720]  that I had a storage problem.
[20:35.120 --> 20:36.040]  Yes.
[20:36.040 --> 20:39.040]  People have whole collections of what they store.
[20:39.040 --> 20:40.440]  I'm not one of those.
[20:41.440 --> 20:43.960]  Airtight containers, if possible.
[20:45.040 --> 20:46.600]  Yeah, airtight containers
[20:46.680 --> 20:49.960]  and probably keeping it in the fridge is a good idea.
[20:49.960 --> 20:50.800]  Just cold.
[20:50.800 --> 20:51.640]  Okay.
[20:51.640 --> 20:52.480]  Yeah.
[20:52.480 --> 20:53.320]  Okay.
[20:54.760 --> 20:55.960]  Sorry.
[20:55.960 --> 21:00.040]  Do you prefer to make like a temple ball
[21:00.040 --> 21:03.800]  or just kind of like a pressed brick with it?
[21:07.400 --> 21:08.240]  I don't know.
[21:08.240 --> 21:12.880]  I would just make the amount I needed
[21:12.880 --> 21:14.600]  for the next few hours.
[21:16.720 --> 21:18.560]  That's what happens.
[21:18.560 --> 21:20.400]  I didn't know that I ever really made bricks
[21:20.400 --> 21:22.080]  and temple balls.
[21:22.080 --> 21:22.920]  Yes.
[21:24.800 --> 21:25.640]  My latest.
[21:25.640 --> 21:29.280]  So never really doing it to sell
[21:29.280 --> 21:31.400]  to a coffee shop or anything.
[21:31.400 --> 21:32.920]  It was more for personal use
[21:32.920 --> 21:35.520]  and I was mainly also experimenting
[21:35.520 --> 21:39.320]  every which way I could think of to see.
[21:39.320 --> 21:42.640]  But just the simple way is the one that works best.
[21:43.640 --> 21:45.200]  Amazing.
[21:45.200 --> 21:47.560]  Work smart, not hard.
[21:47.560 --> 21:51.720]  And shoot, my last foray into that,
[21:51.720 --> 21:54.160]  I had a little, I was trimming over a screen.
[21:54.160 --> 21:57.160]  I just collected all my sift,
[21:57.160 --> 22:00.680]  put it in my cellophane and I did the shoe hash.
[22:00.680 --> 22:03.360]  I just wore it around in my shoe for a couple hours
[22:03.360 --> 22:05.880]  and called it good.
[22:05.880 --> 22:06.720]  Yeah.
[22:06.720 --> 22:10.800]  No, the shoe hash works great if you have small amounts.
[22:10.800 --> 22:11.840]  Yeah.
[22:11.840 --> 22:12.680]  Yeah.
[22:12.680 --> 22:14.080]  And a lot of us.
[22:15.280 --> 22:17.120]  I found out that in Switzerland,
[22:17.120 --> 22:20.480]  the guys go skiing and they put it in their shoe
[22:20.480 --> 22:22.200]  when they go skiing.
[22:22.200 --> 22:25.080]  Their feet get down off when they're skiing
[22:25.080 --> 22:28.240]  and they get some very good hash out of their shoes.
[22:29.600 --> 22:31.880]  I will try that this snowboarding season.
[22:35.280 --> 22:36.120]  I will try that.
[22:43.200 --> 22:44.120]  Okay, let's see.
[22:44.120 --> 22:49.120]  I had a potentponic, Steve, in the chat had a question.
[22:49.440 --> 22:50.640]  Okay.
[22:50.640 --> 22:54.360]  Have you ever tried something like nitrogen flushing
[22:54.360 --> 22:56.200]  for hash storage?
[22:56.200 --> 22:58.720]  It's where you're using like the gas.
[22:58.720 --> 23:00.720]  No, I'm just very old fashioned.
[23:00.720 --> 23:03.960]  I use the bubbler now if I do it.
[23:03.960 --> 23:06.400]  But I don't grow at this moment.
[23:06.400 --> 23:07.240]  I have no time.
[23:07.240 --> 23:08.440]  I travel too much.
[23:09.360 --> 23:13.400]  So I don't really get much of an opportunity
[23:13.400 --> 23:14.960]  to make my own.
[23:14.960 --> 23:16.800]  Sometimes I do it for friends
[23:16.800 --> 23:21.240]  and just to see if the old technique still works best.
[23:22.360 --> 23:23.200]  Yeah.
[23:23.200 --> 23:26.880]  But yeah, like I say, there's been such a development
[23:26.880 --> 23:29.360]  in the direction of concentrates.
[23:29.360 --> 23:32.120]  And even I was just a couple of weeks ago,
[23:32.120 --> 23:34.840]  I was in New York at the best of New York
[23:34.840 --> 23:37.720]  and what they call hash, I was kind of looking at it.
[23:38.480 --> 23:40.280]  It really looked like a hash to me.
[23:40.280 --> 23:41.120]  Yeah.
[23:41.120 --> 23:44.160]  But yeah, it just evolves all the time,
[23:44.160 --> 23:46.000]  which is a very good thing
[23:46.000 --> 23:48.400]  because if something doesn't grow and evolve,
[23:48.400 --> 23:50.680]  it gets stagnant and everything,
[23:50.680 --> 23:55.400]  whether it's architecture, fashion, everything evolves.
[23:55.400 --> 23:57.040]  So the hash making also,
[23:57.040 --> 24:00.000]  but I must say all these newer techniques,
[24:00.000 --> 24:04.280]  I don't have the equipment very often available.
[24:04.280 --> 24:06.120]  Okay, I've made rosin a few times.
[24:06.120 --> 24:07.720]  That's kind of easy.
[24:08.440 --> 24:09.280]  Yes.
[24:11.000 --> 24:14.160]  And we've experimented with rosin
[24:14.160 --> 24:17.960]  and a lot of us are doing this for personal consumption
[24:17.960 --> 24:22.040]  at home, many of us in a medicinal use situation.
[24:23.120 --> 24:26.120]  So it's great to hear a lot of these things.
[24:26.120 --> 24:28.720]  But I also think too-
[24:28.720 --> 24:33.720]  I tried one time, I was invited to come to California
[24:33.720 --> 24:35.600]  and bring all my machines with me,
[24:35.600 --> 24:38.200]  a pollinator and a bubblator.
[24:38.960 --> 24:41.240]  And they wanted to see what would work best
[24:41.240 --> 24:45.680]  for the rosin machine.
[24:45.680 --> 24:49.200]  So the thing was with the pollinator,
[24:49.200 --> 24:51.520]  the crystals just remained light.
[24:51.520 --> 24:54.120]  They had this fresh frozen stuff.
[24:54.120 --> 24:57.680]  But with the isolator, because it's wet,
[24:57.680 --> 25:01.080]  it kind of dried up in this honey color,
[25:01.080 --> 25:04.400]  but it was amazing stuff they had to use it.
[25:04.400 --> 25:06.600]  In the end, it became like a big sheet
[25:06.600 --> 25:09.040]  and all the crystals were stuck together.
[25:09.040 --> 25:10.760]  You could roll it up.
[25:10.760 --> 25:14.240]  Anyway, I preferred the pollinator hash
[25:14.240 --> 25:18.080]  because the end result was just pure transparent
[25:18.080 --> 25:20.200]  and that's what they liked.
[25:21.240 --> 25:24.120]  Yes, color seems to be,
[25:25.240 --> 25:27.240]  whether it's correct or not,
[25:27.240 --> 25:31.240]  color here seems to be an indication of quality.
[25:32.640 --> 25:35.600]  Yeah, and I don't even know if I agree
[25:35.600 --> 25:38.160]  because with all this fresh frozen,
[25:38.160 --> 25:41.200]  as far as I understand it gets harvested
[25:41.200 --> 25:44.720]  when all the crystals are still transparent.
[25:45.800 --> 25:50.080]  And when we were harvesting for wheat to smoke,
[25:50.080 --> 25:53.960]  about 10% of the crystals would have kind of gone
[25:53.960 --> 25:57.120]  honey colored and that's when we'd harvest.
[25:57.120 --> 26:00.960]  So I don't know if you'll harvest it so much earlier,
[26:00.960 --> 26:05.120]  there'll be different cannabinoids involved, no doubt.
[26:05.760 --> 26:09.760]  And I think when you do have it so fresh and you use it,
[26:09.760 --> 26:11.440]  you get this incredible high.
[26:13.200 --> 26:16.160]  Five days later, it's just about gone.
[26:16.160 --> 26:19.080]  Well, if you have some old hash,
[26:19.080 --> 26:22.680]  yeah, you get high and stay high for a while.
[26:22.680 --> 26:24.240]  And yeah, different.
[26:25.920 --> 26:27.640]  And that's what I like about it.
[26:27.640 --> 26:31.120]  I have had the concentrate experience.
[26:31.120 --> 26:32.840]  I've worked in the stores.
[26:32.880 --> 26:36.400]  So samples are given to people that work in the stores
[26:36.400 --> 26:40.600]  and it was different than flour to me.
[26:40.600 --> 26:43.080]  It was a different high, it was a different plateau,
[26:43.080 --> 26:44.600]  it was a different drop-off.
[26:44.600 --> 26:49.600]  Whereas the shoe hash or the hash we're speaking of,
[26:50.160 --> 26:54.480]  that's the closest representation to my body and brain
[26:54.480 --> 26:55.920]  as flour goes.
[26:55.920 --> 26:59.320]  So that is where I tend to gravitate.
[27:00.160 --> 27:01.000]  Yeah.
[27:01.000 --> 27:04.040]  But we're talking about the evolution of it
[27:04.040 --> 27:07.640]  and all these cool new concentrate forms
[27:07.640 --> 27:09.680]  and crystalline and stuff.
[27:09.680 --> 27:10.800]  But at the same time,
[27:10.800 --> 27:15.040]  we almost risk losing some of the traditional art
[27:15.040 --> 27:19.600]  because it's, well, it's gonna be fine
[27:19.600 --> 27:21.240]  in other areas of the world.
[27:21.240 --> 27:24.320]  But if I were to go to any of my stores here,
[27:24.320 --> 27:27.280]  there's only one company I can think of
[27:27.280 --> 27:30.480]  that makes the type of hash we're speaking of.
[27:30.480 --> 27:31.560]  And that's what I want.
[27:31.560 --> 27:34.760]  And I would love more people to experience it here.
[27:34.760 --> 27:36.920]  Well, I tell you one thing.
[27:36.920 --> 27:41.920]  If you Google www.pollinator.nl for Netherlands
[27:43.320 --> 27:45.240]  and you go to our website,
[27:45.240 --> 27:47.520]  all the bags, all the pollinators,
[27:47.520 --> 27:50.520]  all the washing machines will be there.
[27:50.520 --> 27:55.520]  And we make pollinators like from 150 grams of material
[27:55.960 --> 28:00.960]  to 12, 11 pounds of material at a time, big ones.
[28:01.400 --> 28:02.480]  Yeah.
[28:02.480 --> 28:03.920]  And I can just have a look
[28:03.920 --> 28:06.800]  and I think our prices are competitive.
[28:06.800 --> 28:08.960]  The only thing that fucks it up these days
[28:08.960 --> 28:11.560]  is the transport costs.
[28:11.560 --> 28:12.400]  Right.
[28:12.400 --> 28:14.880]  Shipping is always a beast.
[28:14.880 --> 28:18.600]  It's only up so much in price also.
[28:18.600 --> 28:19.440]  Yeah.
[28:19.440 --> 28:22.480]  And that's good that there are still the materials,
[28:22.480 --> 28:24.040]  there are still the options.
[28:24.040 --> 28:27.000]  Now, what option would you recommend
[28:27.000 --> 28:29.840]  maybe for one of the home growers?
[28:31.280 --> 28:32.640]  Sorry.
[28:32.640 --> 28:33.920]  Oh, no worries.
[28:33.920 --> 28:37.960]  I was just asking of the many options that you have,
[28:37.960 --> 28:39.160]  it seems from all the way
[28:39.160 --> 28:42.960]  from recreational person to business,
[28:42.960 --> 28:46.360]  what would you recommend for the home consumer?
[28:46.360 --> 28:47.920]  You already said three bags.
[28:47.920 --> 28:49.360]  Three bags is-
[28:49.360 --> 28:51.760]  Yeah, just for the home consumer.
[28:51.760 --> 28:54.080]  And if you really want to splurge out,
[28:54.080 --> 28:56.280]  get five bags or something.
[28:56.280 --> 29:00.360]  But basically with three bags, you get the essentials.
[29:00.360 --> 29:05.240]  Then with the pollinator, yeah, they're much more expensive.
[29:05.240 --> 29:08.480]  That's really a thing.
[29:10.120 --> 29:13.720]  But yeah, get a small one to start with.
[29:13.720 --> 29:16.080]  If you just have a few plants,
[29:16.080 --> 29:19.880]  the one for 150 grams would be perfect.
[29:20.880 --> 29:22.320]  Okay.
[29:22.320 --> 29:25.560]  Now, I know that you said that you aren't currently growing
[29:25.560 --> 29:30.120]  and this question could be from the past or current,
[29:30.120 --> 29:33.880]  but there was a question, favorite cultivars?
[29:33.880 --> 29:38.160]  And that could be to smoke,
[29:38.160 --> 29:41.240]  but my question, I think I'm gonna put it this way,
[29:41.240 --> 29:43.640]  is have there been any cultivars
[29:43.640 --> 29:47.520]  that you're just impressed with the returns from?
[29:47.520 --> 29:48.360]  It gives you more-
[29:49.120 --> 29:54.120]  One thing, I grew on large scale for about three years
[29:57.080 --> 29:59.480]  when I was having to earn money for all these kids
[29:59.480 --> 30:02.160]  who just wanted a meal every single day.
[30:04.640 --> 30:06.800]  Preferably three years.
[30:06.800 --> 30:07.640]  Oh, geez.
[30:08.560 --> 30:10.120]  I have four kids, that adds up.
[30:10.120 --> 30:13.320]  So I had to do some large scale growths.
[30:14.280 --> 30:18.080]  And all the time I grew in Holland,
[30:18.800 --> 30:20.440]  I only grew one variety
[30:20.440 --> 30:24.880]  because it had been smuggled in by someone from California.
[30:24.880 --> 30:29.880]  And this was in 88, around this time, 87.
[30:31.120 --> 30:33.440]  And it was called Orange Bud.
[30:33.440 --> 30:36.040]  And the people I worked with,
[30:36.040 --> 30:38.520]  they always said if anything better comes along,
[30:38.520 --> 30:40.000]  we'll change.
[30:40.000 --> 30:43.440]  But so far, everybody agreed nothing better
[30:43.440 --> 30:45.120]  had come along yet.
[30:45.120 --> 30:48.440]  So that's actually the only variety I ever grew.
[30:48.440 --> 30:51.520]  And I grew it under six lamps.
[30:51.520 --> 30:56.520]  I grew it in a greenhouse with 24,000 plants in it
[30:58.640 --> 31:01.240]  and always the same plant.
[31:03.240 --> 31:06.200]  So I have no idea how it would have been
[31:06.200 --> 31:08.800]  if I'd suddenly started growing kush
[31:08.800 --> 31:10.520]  or God knows something else.
[31:11.640 --> 31:13.280]  I only be able to do that one.
[31:14.120 --> 31:17.000]  Well, when you have something that you like,
[31:17.000 --> 31:18.880]  that's not a bad thing.
[31:18.880 --> 31:21.360]  It also helps growing just one
[31:21.360 --> 31:24.640]  as far as figuring out feeding and watering
[31:24.640 --> 31:26.960]  and keeping a level canopy.
[31:28.640 --> 31:31.920]  This was outside in a greenhouse though.
[31:31.920 --> 31:33.600]  I've seen a few of the-
[31:33.600 --> 31:35.880]  We did a lot indoor ones.
[31:35.880 --> 31:36.720]  Okay.
[31:37.920 --> 31:41.640]  I was amazed when I visited some of the indoor grows
[31:41.640 --> 31:43.000]  on this last trip.
[31:43.680 --> 31:46.200]  How much humidity and just dampness
[31:46.200 --> 31:48.640]  you have to deal with indoors.
[31:48.640 --> 31:52.480]  Was there ever any situations where you had crops rot
[31:52.480 --> 31:54.920]  or get the powdery mildew?
[31:54.920 --> 31:57.520]  Yeah, I went on holiday one time
[31:57.520 --> 31:59.560]  and stayed away for a week.
[31:59.560 --> 32:02.480]  And what was a crop that should have been harvested
[32:02.480 --> 32:04.720]  hung in the cupboards with the doors closed
[32:04.720 --> 32:06.840]  completely mildewed away.
[32:06.840 --> 32:07.680]  Yeah.
[32:08.760 --> 32:09.840]  I wasn't there.
[32:10.960 --> 32:11.800]  Yeah.
[32:11.960 --> 32:15.040]  Well, we have sometimes experienced it
[32:15.040 --> 32:18.720]  even in the flowering and stages.
[32:19.760 --> 32:22.440]  Just have to take them out immediately
[32:22.440 --> 32:24.320]  as soon as you see them.
[32:24.320 --> 32:27.080]  Sadly enough, it's always the biggest, fattest bugs
[32:27.080 --> 32:28.400]  that go first.
[32:28.400 --> 32:29.240]  Right.
[32:30.880 --> 32:34.240]  The trophy buds are always the ones that go first.
[32:34.240 --> 32:35.080]  Yeah.
[32:37.560 --> 32:41.760]  Oh, and someone's asking here,
[32:42.360 --> 32:45.120]  let's see, grow under a bridge.
[32:45.120 --> 32:48.280]  Did you do a grow under a bridge at some point?
[32:48.280 --> 32:49.800]  That sounds fascinating.
[32:49.800 --> 32:51.360]  Maybe you can tell us about that.
[32:51.360 --> 32:52.200]  I like that one.
[32:52.200 --> 32:53.440]  I'm put the question up here.
[32:53.440 --> 32:56.040]  It was actually under the bridge.
[32:56.040 --> 33:01.040]  There was a whole anti-nuclear space under there.
[33:01.760 --> 33:05.520]  You had to go through these heavy duty doors to get in.
[33:05.520 --> 33:07.720]  And then from under there,
[33:07.720 --> 33:12.200]  there was apparently a tunnel to the palace on the dam.
[33:12.200 --> 33:13.040]  I don't know.
[33:13.040 --> 33:18.040]  We never saw that or did that.
[33:18.200 --> 33:21.760]  But yeah, that was a pretty strange place.
[33:24.360 --> 33:28.920]  I think we could only grow about 24 lamps
[33:28.920 --> 33:30.720]  on half the side of it,
[33:30.720 --> 33:34.920]  halfway up the bridge space, which is what we had.
[33:34.920 --> 33:39.720]  And the most funny thing one time was in the winter time,
[33:39.720 --> 33:43.520]  oh, yeah, all of Amsterdam was covered with snow.
[33:44.400 --> 33:47.600]  And I do my rounds and I go to this,
[33:47.600 --> 33:51.520]  and it's actually the space above the lamps.
[33:51.520 --> 33:53.640]  There is no snow.
[33:53.640 --> 33:56.320]  Now there was six meters of soil.
[33:58.320 --> 33:59.880]  Okay, that's why.
[33:59.880 --> 34:03.240]  The grow in the top of the bridge.
[34:04.120 --> 34:04.960]  Oh, wow.
[34:04.960 --> 34:07.560]  It would be hard to go in down there that morning.
[34:07.560 --> 34:10.040]  But thank goodness, like in Amsterdam,
[34:10.040 --> 34:11.920]  all snow melts quickly.
[34:11.920 --> 34:14.200]  So by the time I'd done,
[34:14.200 --> 34:18.040]  I think I had to fix a new neutron tank or something.
[34:19.600 --> 34:22.960]  I came up, it was all melted and you couldn't see it.
[34:22.960 --> 34:25.000]  But oh man, that was quite something.
[34:27.440 --> 34:28.760]  No, nerve wracking.
[34:28.760 --> 34:32.320]  That's always the funny photo of the row of roofs with snow.
[34:32.320 --> 34:35.520]  And then there's just one with the bear patch on it.
[34:35.520 --> 34:37.160]  And this was on a bridge.
[34:41.720 --> 34:43.560]  How did you get power?
[34:43.560 --> 34:45.520]  Was it just plugging into this?
[34:45.520 --> 34:48.080]  There was power down there.
[34:48.080 --> 34:51.680]  Well, it was a bomb shelter of some sort
[34:51.680 --> 34:53.720]  originally built as,
[34:53.720 --> 34:57.640]  and before that time it used to be the jail.
[34:57.640 --> 35:00.680]  So the tourists that would come by there,
[35:00.720 --> 35:02.120]  they don't get pointed out,
[35:02.120 --> 35:05.800]  that is the door of the old jail under the bridge.
[35:05.800 --> 35:09.800]  And we'd just be moving plants out or in.
[35:09.800 --> 35:10.640]  And.
[35:10.640 --> 35:11.480]  Right.
[35:13.960 --> 35:15.280]  Oh, gracious.
[35:15.280 --> 35:17.520]  That would be a lovely sight.
[35:17.520 --> 35:20.280]  Everybody, all the tourists get their cameras out.
[35:21.920 --> 35:24.560]  I think little, well, we wouldn't open it.
[35:24.560 --> 35:27.280]  It would always be wrapped up and covered.
[35:27.280 --> 35:28.120]  Yeah.
[35:28.160 --> 35:29.440]  Yeah.
[35:29.440 --> 35:32.960]  You can try the best, but it doesn't always,
[35:32.960 --> 35:35.320]  somebody sometimes sees.
[35:35.320 --> 35:36.920]  Yeah, no, no, nobody saw.
[35:36.920 --> 35:38.880]  Or if they did, they didn't.
[35:38.880 --> 35:41.200]  We never had that kind of problem there.
[35:41.200 --> 35:42.440]  Yeah.
[35:42.440 --> 35:43.640]  Yeah, well, that's good.
[35:43.640 --> 35:47.080]  Now, we've been talking a lot about Amsterdam,
[35:47.080 --> 35:50.760]  probably because I never get tired of talking about it.
[35:50.760 --> 35:53.120]  I love visiting the city.
[35:53.120 --> 35:56.880]  But you have had some great adventures in life.
[35:56.880 --> 36:01.880]  You visited some very remote regions of the world.
[36:02.280 --> 36:04.120]  Do you wanna talk about any of those
[36:04.120 --> 36:05.840]  or maybe some unique experiences
[36:05.840 --> 36:10.840]  where you came across a new cultivar or technique?
[36:11.840 --> 36:13.560]  No, I must disappoint you there.
[36:13.560 --> 36:17.360]  In my travels, I was never like some of these seed guys
[36:17.360 --> 36:19.400]  looking for cultivars.
[36:20.880 --> 36:24.680]  I always thought for the first 60 years of my life
[36:24.720 --> 36:27.400]  that I was just a recreational smoker.
[36:27.400 --> 36:29.120]  But then afterwards, I realized
[36:29.120 --> 36:31.120]  maybe actually it's medicinal
[36:31.120 --> 36:33.520]  because I've never really been sick.
[36:34.840 --> 36:37.640]  The only operation I had was for something
[36:37.640 --> 36:42.640]  that you inherit, genetic thing, so it doesn't really count.
[36:43.480 --> 36:44.320]  Yeah, but...
[36:48.240 --> 36:49.080]  So.
[36:49.080 --> 36:50.960]  We were talking about...
[36:50.960 --> 36:54.160]  Yeah, just kind of some travels,
[36:54.560 --> 36:57.560]  maybe about some of your time in Afghanistan.
[36:57.560 --> 37:02.560]  That's a region that not many of us go to over here.
[37:02.800 --> 37:04.440]  Again, that's another thing I love about there.
[37:04.440 --> 37:06.040]  It's like the doorstep to anywhere.
[37:06.040 --> 37:07.440]  Do I wanna go to Paris today?
[37:07.440 --> 37:08.880]  Sure, two hours.
[37:08.880 --> 37:11.400]  Do I wanna catch a concert in London tonight?
[37:11.400 --> 37:13.200]  Sure, two hours.
[37:13.200 --> 37:17.680]  From here, it's 14 hours any way I cut it.
[37:17.680 --> 37:20.240]  Yeah, but that's the same if something is happening
[37:20.240 --> 37:22.500]  in New York, let alone in California.
[37:23.460 --> 37:24.300]  That's true.
[37:25.780 --> 37:28.020]  Way further, way further.
[37:28.020 --> 37:33.020]  But how we entered Afghanistan was quite memorable
[37:34.780 --> 37:36.620]  and how we left Afghanistan.
[37:36.620 --> 37:39.860]  Inside Afghanistan, it's a wonderful country.
[37:39.860 --> 37:41.860]  The people were so welcoming.
[37:41.860 --> 37:45.940]  It was an invite you to their homes and everything.
[37:45.940 --> 37:48.500]  I realized it was the only country
[37:48.540 --> 37:53.220]  that all men and women wore embroidered clothes.
[37:53.220 --> 37:56.300]  The men had the big thing in the front of their shirts
[37:56.300 --> 37:58.660]  and the women were pretty much embroidered
[37:58.660 --> 38:00.160]  everywhere their clothes.
[38:01.620 --> 38:04.300]  That's completely changed, of course.
[38:04.300 --> 38:07.260]  Yeah, they were so welcoming.
[38:07.260 --> 38:11.220]  Like when we came in, we were in some Iranian bus
[38:11.220 --> 38:14.180]  that stopped about a mile short of the Afghan border
[38:14.180 --> 38:17.020]  and they pointed up there at the lights
[38:17.020 --> 38:18.220]  and that was their only lights.
[38:18.940 --> 38:20.460]  It was a pitch dark night.
[38:20.460 --> 38:22.700]  So, Maloose was just a little girl
[38:22.700 --> 38:25.460]  and we had to walk up there.
[38:25.460 --> 38:28.660]  And then when we got there, there was a few chai shops there
[38:29.980 --> 38:33.500]  and we sat down and we got some chai and everything.
[38:33.500 --> 38:37.940]  And then the custom guys walked over
[38:37.940 --> 38:41.300]  and they brought with them their own hubbly-bubbly.
[38:41.300 --> 38:43.980]  Now, that's what the big pipe that they used
[38:43.980 --> 38:45.980]  to smoke their hashish.
[38:45.980 --> 38:50.900]  So, they filled it and showed me how to use it.
[38:50.900 --> 38:54.300]  And then they said, welcome to Afghanistan.
[38:54.300 --> 38:59.300]  And then the night, sometime in September in 68,
[39:00.940 --> 39:02.500]  it was amazing.
[39:05.860 --> 39:08.780]  I really liked the people there and everything.
[39:10.020 --> 39:12.060]  But this was long before the Russians,
[39:12.060 --> 39:15.220]  before the Americans, before anybody got there.
[39:15.300 --> 39:17.100]  It was quite different then.
[39:18.700 --> 39:20.780]  Shame what it has become.
[39:23.180 --> 39:26.620]  It's been a region at war for decades.
[39:26.620 --> 39:28.100]  So, yeah.
[39:29.020 --> 39:32.300]  It's great that you did to see some of that,
[39:32.300 --> 39:34.140]  the traditional kind of culture,
[39:34.140 --> 39:36.380]  just the fashion, as you mentioned.
[39:36.380 --> 39:37.220]  Yeah.
[39:37.220 --> 39:39.700]  Now, we were sitting up in Mazar-e-Sharif
[39:39.700 --> 39:43.620]  in this, some kind of restaurant
[39:43.620 --> 39:45.700]  and they had all their carpets on the walls
[39:45.700 --> 39:47.500]  with the little niches for lights.
[39:47.500 --> 39:51.740]  And all the men are sitting cross-legged
[39:51.740 --> 39:53.340]  behind low tables.
[39:53.340 --> 39:55.700]  And each one of them, you could have had a portrait
[39:55.700 --> 39:58.180]  and put it in National Geographic.
[39:58.180 --> 40:00.100]  You know, they were just amazing.
[40:00.940 --> 40:05.020]  Anyway, they served us food and everybody's not eating.
[40:05.020 --> 40:06.860]  And suddenly after about 20 minutes,
[40:06.860 --> 40:09.060]  all these little kids start running around
[40:09.060 --> 40:11.340]  trying to serve everybody at once.
[40:11.340 --> 40:12.940]  And it'd been Ramadan.
[40:13.940 --> 40:17.420]  We had total ignorant foreigners, had no idea.
[40:17.420 --> 40:19.780]  So, we had just started eating.
[40:19.780 --> 40:22.180]  But nobody made us feel bad.
[40:22.180 --> 40:25.020]  Nobody judged us in any way.
[40:25.020 --> 40:29.060]  In fact, afterwards they got music happening
[40:29.060 --> 40:31.140]  and hookah smoking.
[40:31.140 --> 40:35.220]  And yeah, they were just wonderful.
[40:35.220 --> 40:37.580]  I really enjoyed the people there.
[40:37.580 --> 40:38.500]  Yeah.
[40:38.500 --> 40:39.340]  That's good.
[40:39.340 --> 40:41.860]  That sounds like a wonderful experience.
[40:41.900 --> 40:44.100]  You know, a lot of times too, when we travel,
[40:44.100 --> 40:48.660]  we may be a little ignorant to local cultures
[40:48.660 --> 40:52.540]  or even religious customs in this example,
[40:52.540 --> 40:53.500]  but we learn.
[40:53.500 --> 40:55.140]  And that's the difference to me
[40:55.140 --> 40:58.140]  between ignorance and stupidity.
[40:58.140 --> 41:00.620]  None of this or anything that we didn't know
[41:00.620 --> 41:02.140]  about their customs.
[41:02.140 --> 41:05.020]  And then of course, when we left Afghanistan,
[41:05.020 --> 41:07.900]  you first come to the Khyber Pass,
[41:07.900 --> 41:12.580]  which is a notorious place for dealings going on
[41:12.580 --> 41:16.700]  between India and Pakistan and Afghanistan.
[41:16.700 --> 41:19.660]  So there you could buy hash.
[41:19.660 --> 41:22.460]  It was $10 a kilo.
[41:23.460 --> 41:24.780]  And I bought two kilo.
[41:26.660 --> 41:29.300]  And then we were on this bus
[41:29.300 --> 41:31.700]  and there was my daughter and me
[41:31.700 --> 41:34.140]  were sitting in the front then.
[41:34.140 --> 41:37.180]  And in the back was six other travelers.
[41:37.220 --> 41:39.540]  And we had all their hash in our one big bag
[41:39.540 --> 41:44.540]  and covered it with kids stuff.
[41:44.580 --> 41:46.940]  And then we get to the Pakistani border
[41:46.940 --> 41:51.940]  and somebody comes over from the custom officer
[41:52.660 --> 41:56.220]  who invites my daughter and me to come and have tea with him.
[41:56.220 --> 41:59.900]  So we carry over this heavy bag and put it down.
[41:59.900 --> 42:01.620]  We have tea and cookies.
[42:01.620 --> 42:03.260]  And he's talking to him in love.
[42:03.260 --> 42:05.540]  He's never seen a little girl with blonde hair
[42:05.540 --> 42:06.580]  and blue eyes.
[42:08.020 --> 42:11.300]  Meantime, the whole bus gets ransacked and searched.
[42:11.300 --> 42:16.300]  And the bags get taken back in.
[42:19.340 --> 42:21.300]  We drive on into Pakistan.
[42:23.460 --> 42:25.100]  What wonderful luck.
[42:25.100 --> 42:26.420]  That is amazing.
[42:29.180 --> 42:30.020]  Kismet.
[42:31.100 --> 42:32.060]  That's great.
[42:32.060 --> 42:33.900]  You can have wonderful luck everywhere.
[42:33.900 --> 42:36.500]  I'm just thinking of another incident
[42:36.820 --> 42:38.300]  we had with local cops.
[42:38.300 --> 42:42.060]  And that was only like a few years ago in Mexico.
[42:42.060 --> 42:46.420]  Some of the friends that I ran the Dabadoo with there,
[42:46.420 --> 42:48.300]  they'd pick me up from the airport
[42:48.300 --> 42:50.500]  in an old Volkswagen van.
[42:50.500 --> 42:52.940]  And we're just driving away from the airport
[42:52.940 --> 42:56.380]  when some cops, military stop us,
[42:56.380 --> 42:58.020]  you know, not just with a pistol,
[42:58.020 --> 43:00.820]  but with having machine guns and everything.
[43:00.820 --> 43:04.900]  And I could hear the conversation between the driver
[43:04.900 --> 43:06.660]  and them was not friendly.
[43:09.580 --> 43:11.540]  I know I don't have anything,
[43:11.540 --> 43:14.420]  but I don't know what these guys have in this van.
[43:14.420 --> 43:18.100]  You know, they might have whatever kilo of weed
[43:18.100 --> 43:20.260]  lying in there or something.
[43:20.260 --> 43:22.500]  So I decided to get out of the van.
[43:22.500 --> 43:25.020]  And all the guns get pointed at me.
[43:25.020 --> 43:27.300]  And I said, you're a tourist.
[43:27.300 --> 43:29.540]  And I just arrived in Mexico.
[43:29.540 --> 43:31.740]  Can I have a photograph with you?
[43:31.740 --> 43:34.740]  Man, they suddenly became the friendliest cops.
[43:35.580 --> 43:39.500]  They were all standing in a row with big smiles.
[43:39.500 --> 43:43.020]  All thoughts of checking our van completely gone.
[43:44.740 --> 43:47.340]  They wished me a happy stay in Mexico.
[43:47.340 --> 43:50.820]  Oh my goodness.
[43:50.820 --> 43:53.500]  That is golden.
[43:53.500 --> 43:55.620]  So wow.
[43:55.620 --> 43:59.380]  That is how you have survived in this industry.
[43:59.380 --> 44:03.220]  You just have nerves of steel and quick thinking.
[44:05.740 --> 44:08.420]  I think as a single mom of four,
[44:08.420 --> 44:11.500]  you have to get pretty good at quick thinking
[44:11.500 --> 44:14.340]  and also pretty good at thinking out the box.
[44:16.020 --> 44:18.420]  Well, I'm going to borrow this
[44:18.420 --> 44:21.500]  because I will be going to Mexico in November.
[44:21.500 --> 44:23.860]  And should there be any incidences,
[44:23.860 --> 44:26.780]  I will absolutely ask for a picture.
[44:28.180 --> 44:30.540]  So you're a tourist, you just arrived.
[44:32.860 --> 44:33.980]  That is wonderful.
[44:34.020 --> 44:38.260]  Useful thing, see, we're getting great education today.
[44:38.260 --> 44:39.780]  This is perfect.
[44:41.180 --> 44:43.340]  And you mentioned that you were there
[44:43.340 --> 44:45.540]  for the Dabadoo events.
[44:45.540 --> 44:47.900]  Now I'm familiar with them.
[44:47.900 --> 44:50.980]  I just had John M, Gross Base Killa,
[44:50.980 --> 44:53.460]  he had entered and participated
[44:53.460 --> 44:55.740]  in one of the Dabadoo events.
[44:55.740 --> 44:59.940]  He's got a nice little trophy for the effort.
[44:59.940 --> 45:03.140]  Can you maybe tell people who are unfamiliar
[45:03.180 --> 45:05.420]  with the Dabadoo events, kind of what they are
[45:05.420 --> 45:08.540]  and what was the motivation behind doing this?
[45:08.540 --> 45:12.580]  To do something for my 69th birthday.
[45:13.420 --> 45:17.340]  And it was going to be to do with dabbing.
[45:18.140 --> 45:22.980]  And then within like 36 hours, Dabadoo came into my mind.
[45:24.300 --> 45:26.820]  And it's basically a competition,
[45:26.820 --> 45:29.540]  but only about different forms of hash.
[45:29.540 --> 45:32.700]  So there can be entries in dry sift hash
[45:33.260 --> 45:36.700]  and water hash and rosin and extracts,
[45:36.700 --> 45:40.740]  in vape pens even, all the possibilities.
[45:43.340 --> 45:45.740]  But that was just gonna be a one-time event
[45:45.740 --> 45:46.700]  and never again.
[45:46.700 --> 45:48.660]  And then everybody liked it so much.
[45:48.660 --> 45:51.860]  Four months later, we had one in Barcelona
[45:53.100 --> 45:58.100]  and that was in 2014, their time.
[45:58.620 --> 45:59.860]  Their time.
[45:59.860 --> 46:03.980]  And by now we've done 32 of them.
[46:05.060 --> 46:09.860]  And a few years ago, I made a tour in South America
[46:09.860 --> 46:11.420]  and this year we're gonna repeat it.
[46:11.420 --> 46:14.980]  In fact, me and my daughter will be leaving Amsterdam
[46:14.980 --> 46:19.140]  on the 12th of September and flying to Brazil
[46:19.140 --> 46:20.940]  where the first Dabadoo will be.
[46:22.340 --> 46:25.420]  And then after that in Uruguay, another Dabadoo,
[46:25.460 --> 46:29.340]  Argentina, another one, Chile, Peru,
[46:30.740 --> 46:34.580]  Mexico, Costa Rica, and we finish in Colombia.
[46:35.980 --> 46:37.100]  That is great.
[46:37.100 --> 46:39.580]  That is a wide ranging tour.
[46:39.580 --> 46:41.140]  And what I pick up from it too
[46:41.140 --> 46:43.020]  is that you're returning to these areas.
[46:43.020 --> 46:46.380]  So not only were you able to do it once,
[46:46.380 --> 46:50.220]  they are supportive and like, do this again, please.
[46:50.220 --> 46:52.740]  I think in Mexico and in Colombia,
[46:52.740 --> 46:56.260]  maybe we already doing like the fifth one, maybe.
[46:57.140 --> 46:59.940]  Because in Mexico, we did two up on the mountain,
[46:59.940 --> 47:02.260]  one up on a freezing cold mountain,
[47:02.260 --> 47:06.780]  one in a hotel with 12 swimming pools.
[47:06.780 --> 47:07.620]  Oh, wow.
[47:09.260 --> 47:12.780]  Coming up, so that makes like the fifth one already.
[47:12.780 --> 47:15.860]  And Colombia also, the first time in Colombia,
[47:15.860 --> 47:19.820]  they rented a helicopter to fly me to the location
[47:19.820 --> 47:22.140]  of the Dabadoo over the jungle.
[47:22.540 --> 47:23.860]  That was amazing.
[47:23.860 --> 47:26.700]  I never been in a helicopter.
[47:26.700 --> 47:29.140]  And the nice thing was they rented the helicopter
[47:29.140 --> 47:30.700]  for the whole day.
[47:30.700 --> 47:34.420]  So like a lot of the people who'd come to the Dabadoo,
[47:34.420 --> 47:37.380]  they would all go up for five minutes, have a talk,
[47:37.380 --> 47:39.140]  and come back down again.
[47:39.140 --> 47:41.060]  That was a memorable Dabadoo.
[47:43.140 --> 47:45.700]  And that's where I met this Mexican guy.
[47:45.700 --> 47:47.060]  He came over, he said,
[47:47.060 --> 47:50.340]  hey, I would like to do a Dabadoo in Mexico.
[47:50.380 --> 47:52.500]  I said, well, you see what we're doing,
[47:52.500 --> 47:54.700]  testing all these different hashes.
[47:54.700 --> 47:58.660]  If you know a place in Mexico where we have no problems.
[47:58.660 --> 48:00.860]  And four months later, we had one,
[48:00.860 --> 48:04.180]  and he'd rented this extreme sports center
[48:04.180 --> 48:05.900]  on top of a mountain.
[48:05.900 --> 48:10.580]  And I went paragliding off that mountain one time.
[48:10.580 --> 48:11.580]  Yeah.
[48:11.580 --> 48:12.780]  You did?
[48:12.780 --> 48:13.860]  With a buddy.
[48:13.860 --> 48:16.180]  With a buddy, yeah, of course.
[48:16.180 --> 48:18.620]  And have you ever parachuted?
[48:18.620 --> 48:19.620]  No.
[48:19.620 --> 48:20.900]  Okay.
[48:20.900 --> 48:23.020]  There's still something left for you to do.
[48:23.020 --> 48:24.140]  I'm sorry to interrupt you,
[48:24.140 --> 48:28.060]  but extreme sports, paragliding, helicopter rides.
[48:28.060 --> 48:29.620]  If you want to make an entrance,
[48:29.620 --> 48:32.420]  you know how to make an entrance.
[48:32.420 --> 48:34.140]  Well, this is what the people
[48:34.140 --> 48:36.700]  would kind of cook up themselves.
[48:36.700 --> 48:37.540]  Yeah.
[48:39.900 --> 48:42.820]  Well, you have a fun personality to go along with it then.
[48:42.820 --> 48:43.660]  How about that?
[48:43.660 --> 48:44.500]  Okay.
[48:47.500 --> 48:48.340]  Awesome.
[48:48.340 --> 48:49.180]  That would be fun.
[48:49.780 --> 48:54.780]  To see the beauty of in whatever situation is there,
[48:56.420 --> 48:59.060]  learning to accept anything that comes,
[48:59.060 --> 49:01.380]  you know, and not be too judgmental.
[49:02.300 --> 49:05.580]  I stopped wanting to be fanatic about anything anymore.
[49:07.060 --> 49:08.860]  I'm 77 now, so.
[49:13.860 --> 49:15.940]  At some of these events that you're doing,
[49:15.940 --> 49:19.620]  the Dabadoos, are you acting as judge as well?
[49:19.620 --> 49:23.140]  Do you get to try these different styles
[49:23.140 --> 49:25.100]  and like the vape pens?
[49:25.980 --> 49:29.340]  I can try whatever I want.
[49:29.340 --> 49:31.380]  I don't have to judge.
[49:31.380 --> 49:32.220]  Okay.
[49:32.220 --> 49:35.500]  Because, yeah, there's too many.
[49:35.500 --> 49:40.500]  And I'm also like, you know, communicating with people.
[49:41.300 --> 49:43.220]  You know, suddenly you get all these people
[49:43.260 --> 49:44.940]  and only South American ones,
[49:44.940 --> 49:47.740]  the Dabadoos are different again.
[49:47.740 --> 49:52.060]  Like in Peru, they just rented a Hacienda for a week
[49:52.060 --> 49:54.060]  and the Dabadoo lasted for a week.
[49:55.940 --> 50:00.940]  And all these glass blowing units set up permanently,
[50:02.540 --> 50:03.660]  four of them.
[50:03.660 --> 50:06.020]  So there was about 15 glass blowers,
[50:06.020 --> 50:08.540]  always somebody making something.
[50:08.540 --> 50:10.020]  Yeah, it was amazing.
[50:10.460 --> 50:11.300]  Yeah.
[50:12.100 --> 50:14.460]  It's fun to get access to those things.
[50:14.460 --> 50:16.980]  A lot of us, you know, even like hash,
[50:16.980 --> 50:19.180]  but in particular the glass blowing,
[50:19.180 --> 50:21.140]  we always see the final product.
[50:21.140 --> 50:24.500]  We use the final product, we admire it,
[50:24.500 --> 50:28.620]  but to see it being created is something else
[50:28.620 --> 50:31.380]  and can almost give you a deeper appreciation
[50:31.380 --> 50:34.380]  for what you hold in your hand.
[50:34.380 --> 50:37.060]  Somewhere I have a beer bottle.
[50:37.060 --> 50:38.900]  I think it was a hemp beer bottle.
[50:39.900 --> 50:43.580]  The end of it has been transformed into a dragon's head.
[50:44.460 --> 50:45.300]  Oh, wow.
[50:45.300 --> 50:47.020]  That's amazing.
[50:48.980 --> 50:52.300]  They do lots of cool stuff with it.
[50:54.380 --> 50:59.060]  Have you branched out as far as trying
[50:59.060 --> 51:03.860]  some of the more isolated cannabinoids or terpenes
[51:03.860 --> 51:04.700]  at these events?
[51:04.700 --> 51:08.780]  I'd imagine like a crystalline or THCA is one thing
[51:09.660 --> 51:11.020]  that they might have.
[51:11.020 --> 51:15.260]  Have you tried things in different isolated forms?
[51:15.260 --> 51:16.100]  Not really.
[51:16.100 --> 51:19.780]  I haven't really come across the possibility
[51:19.780 --> 51:22.340]  that it's available in isolated forms.
[51:23.380 --> 51:26.900]  Sometimes it tells you what's been added somewhere,
[51:26.900 --> 51:30.180]  but I've never really had an opportunity.
[51:30.180 --> 51:31.580]  Okay.
[51:31.580 --> 51:34.980]  Well, I'm sure it will come up for you at some point,
[51:34.980 --> 51:38.860]  but insider opinion, you already have the good stuff.
[51:42.260 --> 51:43.420]  Yeah, I'm quite happy.
[51:45.700 --> 51:48.900]  Because every joint that I smoke,
[51:50.020 --> 51:53.700]  the one that I'm gonna light up now is my best one,
[51:55.700 --> 51:58.940]  because this is the one that's happening here and now.
[51:59.860 --> 52:02.660]  All these other joints are somewhere in the clouds,
[52:02.660 --> 52:05.180]  in the past, in the future,
[52:05.180 --> 52:08.060]  but this is what's happening right now.
[52:08.060 --> 52:11.420]  So I'm 100% sure it's the best joint.
[52:14.560 --> 52:15.400]  I love that.
[52:15.400 --> 52:16.400]  I can't argue with that.
[52:16.400 --> 52:18.960]  I will smoke to that.
[52:18.960 --> 52:20.680]  I usually smoke the little chillum,
[52:20.680 --> 52:24.760]  just a little one here and there as I go through the day.
[52:26.120 --> 52:27.240]  I enjoy that way.
[52:27.240 --> 52:30.320]  It's more of a steady throughout the day for me
[52:30.360 --> 52:35.200]  versus sit down and just, oh, get to it.
[52:35.200 --> 52:37.960]  Yeah, but yeah, now we're in conversation,
[52:37.960 --> 52:40.360]  so I'll probably smoke this to the end.
[52:40.360 --> 52:42.840]  But normally during the day,
[52:44.040 --> 52:46.080]  I'll take some puffs, put it down,
[52:46.080 --> 52:49.240]  continue whatever I'm doing.
[52:49.240 --> 52:52.640]  I don't really smoke them from beginning to end in one go.
[52:54.080 --> 52:54.920]  Yes.
[52:56.560 --> 52:58.240]  Only when I'm on long walks
[52:58.240 --> 53:00.520]  do I smoke the joint beginning to end.
[53:02.520 --> 53:04.160]  Only on long walks.
[53:04.160 --> 53:05.000]  Yeah.
[53:06.800 --> 53:10.400]  So we did have a question in chat earlier.
[53:11.520 --> 53:16.520]  Was asking if you prefer more of the kind of like
[53:16.680 --> 53:21.000]  sedative indica or like cush high,
[53:21.000 --> 53:25.160]  or do you typically prefer a more like a haze
[53:25.160 --> 53:27.520]  or a sativa or an up high?
[53:28.280 --> 53:31.680]  Granted, it might be different times of the day
[53:31.680 --> 53:33.120]  where you like different ones,
[53:33.120 --> 53:35.960]  but that question came up, so I thought I'd ask.
[53:38.000 --> 53:43.000]  There's not much sativa type around.
[53:44.400 --> 53:47.880]  Mostly people seem to have more indica types.
[53:48.920 --> 53:50.760]  I like it when I can get it.
[53:50.760 --> 53:54.600]  And some, most of it actually is never pure sativa.
[53:54.600 --> 53:56.440]  It's some kind of mix.
[53:58.910 --> 53:59.750]  We did-
[53:59.750 --> 54:03.710]  I prefer, but it's not always there.
[54:06.110 --> 54:10.070]  We did, sorry, I'm just reloading my bowl here.
[54:10.070 --> 54:11.270]  I'm paying attention.
[54:14.390 --> 54:18.430]  My wife and I enjoyed a lot of the hazes
[54:18.430 --> 54:20.190]  while we were in Amsterdam.
[54:20.190 --> 54:23.310]  We have a feeling here that commercially,
[54:23.310 --> 54:25.950]  because they take so long to finish,
[54:25.950 --> 54:29.910]  that the commercial processors don't allow them to finish.
[54:29.910 --> 54:33.110]  And it gives her bad anxiety.
[54:33.110 --> 54:35.590]  But everything that we had,
[54:36.470 --> 54:39.070]  coffee shop or otherwise there,
[54:39.070 --> 54:41.830]  the hazes really hit the spot for her.
[54:41.830 --> 54:44.630]  Well, because they really grow them the full length
[54:45.830 --> 54:47.830]  that they need to grow.
[54:47.830 --> 54:52.830]  Well, I also think Dutch seed breeders are a bit,
[54:53.470 --> 54:57.030]  have done that,
[54:57.030 --> 55:02.030]  that they tried to eliminate the CBD and promote THC.
[55:04.270 --> 55:08.910]  But I think when they eliminate too much the CBD,
[55:08.910 --> 55:10.910]  that's when people start to get,
[55:13.350 --> 55:16.470]  getting problems with it, especially young people.
[55:16.470 --> 55:20.190]  Lots of psychosis and things like that.
[55:20.230 --> 55:23.710]  And I think that's because in the modern breeding system,
[55:23.710 --> 55:26.350]  the CBD is kind of being bred away.
[55:26.350 --> 55:27.710]  Like in the East,
[55:27.710 --> 55:32.430]  never see young people that are smoking in any way.
[55:32.430 --> 55:34.870]  Everybody seems very happy with it.
[55:34.870 --> 55:38.990]  I don't see any psychological problems arising.
[55:40.790 --> 55:43.470]  Yeah, and that'll be interesting too.
[55:43.470 --> 55:47.190]  Just, so the endocannabinoid system,
[55:47.190 --> 55:49.470]  which is called the ECS for short,
[55:49.470 --> 55:52.310]  is the internal system we all have,
[55:52.310 --> 55:54.150]  most mammals do,
[55:54.150 --> 55:55.910]  that deal with these cannabinoids
[55:55.910 --> 55:57.990]  and the processing of them.
[55:57.990 --> 56:00.070]  And the receptors.
[56:00.070 --> 56:03.070]  Yeah, and it's interesting too,
[56:03.070 --> 56:04.990]  cause I like to follow a lot of this research.
[56:04.990 --> 56:08.170]  Again, I fully believe in this plant as a medicine.
[56:09.190 --> 56:12.390]  And so I look into the medicinal applications.
[56:12.390 --> 56:15.430]  But one thing that they're talking about
[56:15.430 --> 56:19.510]  with some of the 94% THC,
[56:19.510 --> 56:22.270]  is you're just blasting those receptors
[56:22.270 --> 56:25.150]  with such a heavy dose that it,
[56:25.150 --> 56:30.150]  we don't really know necessarily what that is.
[56:30.390 --> 56:32.670]  And that is where they think some of the,
[56:32.670 --> 56:34.670]  the quote unquote psychosis comes from,
[56:34.670 --> 56:38.470]  or just the kids that are having issues with it.
[56:38.470 --> 56:42.750]  I mean, bred away in Western countries, all the CBD.
[56:42.750 --> 56:45.710]  If you look at the original land races,
[56:45.710 --> 56:47.470]  wherever they're coming from,
[56:47.470 --> 56:48.710]  they're full of CBD.
[56:51.670 --> 56:53.550]  I was in Kazakhstan a few times.
[56:53.550 --> 56:56.790]  They have a million, 200,000 hectares
[56:56.790 --> 56:58.830]  of wild marijuana growing there.
[56:59.670 --> 57:03.110]  So the discussion came what to do with it.
[57:04.110 --> 57:05.430]  Yeah.
[57:05.430 --> 57:06.910]  I was gonna say my,
[57:06.910 --> 57:09.070]  I had a family member that lived there for a while.
[57:09.070 --> 57:09.990]  They never mentioned it.
[57:09.990 --> 57:11.750]  Maybe they didn't want me to visit.
[57:12.670 --> 57:14.910]  I would have been like, what?
[57:14.910 --> 57:15.750]  Yeah.
[57:15.750 --> 57:19.070]  It's apparently the only one that you can see from space.
[57:20.150 --> 57:21.990]  But it's like it's planted.
[57:21.990 --> 57:23.390]  It's really growing wild.
[57:23.390 --> 57:27.750]  So yeah, it's amazing.
[57:27.750 --> 57:32.070]  There's a few wild patches in areas of this country,
[57:32.070 --> 57:36.150]  like Kentucky area, that does have the wild stuff.
[57:36.150 --> 57:39.310]  It's, you know, ditch weed or headache weed.
[57:40.270 --> 57:42.910]  If you're looking to get, you know, high off of it,
[57:42.910 --> 57:45.030]  you'll be disappointed,
[57:45.030 --> 57:47.110]  but that doesn't mean it doesn't have
[57:47.110 --> 57:49.950]  these minor cannabinoids.
[57:49.950 --> 57:53.910]  If you look at the old history in Afghanistan,
[57:53.910 --> 57:56.190]  the best stuff came from the North.
[57:56.190 --> 57:59.110]  Now, if you go directly North from Afghanistan,
[57:59.110 --> 58:01.190]  you end up in Kazakhstan.
[58:01.190 --> 58:06.190]  But I think when Stalin was ruling also Kazakhstan,
[58:07.030 --> 58:10.310]  he saw how in China they were growing hemp
[58:11.230 --> 58:12.870]  and making all their millions
[58:12.870 --> 58:15.590]  of little blue suits out of hemp.
[58:15.590 --> 58:17.910]  And he thought, oh, that's handy.
[58:17.910 --> 58:21.190]  And he wanted to turn Kazakhstan more into a hemp field
[58:21.190 --> 58:24.990]  so he could use it for making cloth.
[58:24.990 --> 58:29.430]  So I think what happens then when you mix hemp
[58:30.790 --> 58:35.150]  with THC rich, it just gets a mess
[58:35.190 --> 58:37.310]  and ends up somewhere in between.
[58:37.310 --> 58:41.110]  And that's pretty much what the Kazakh weed is right now.
[58:41.110 --> 58:44.710]  You don't get very high THC levels.
[58:44.710 --> 58:49.710]  You get five, 6% CBD, which is quite high.
[58:49.950 --> 58:50.790]  Yeah.
[58:50.790 --> 58:52.070]  Yeah.
[58:52.070 --> 58:53.350]  That's a good percentage.
[58:53.350 --> 58:55.890]  And that's something, you know, we look for here.
[58:55.890 --> 59:00.890]  I always like to have a jar of something CBD rich with me.
[59:01.170 --> 59:06.170]  It's usually Harlequin or I have cherry wine seeds coming
[59:08.690 --> 59:12.130]  which is a popular CBD strain.
[59:12.130 --> 59:13.330]  So that'll be fun.
[59:14.570 --> 59:17.210]  Let's see here.
[59:17.210 --> 59:18.450]  Block user.
[59:18.450 --> 59:19.290]  Let's see.
[59:19.290 --> 59:20.110]  Okay.
[59:20.110 --> 59:20.950]  Sorry about that.
[59:22.370 --> 59:25.410]  So was there ever a favorite region you had mentioned,
[59:25.410 --> 59:27.210]  you know, you liked the stuff that was coming out
[59:27.210 --> 59:28.490]  of that Northern area,
[59:28.490 --> 59:31.010]  but if you had to pick one region of the world
[59:31.010 --> 59:34.090]  where you may be experienced your favorite hash?
[59:34.090 --> 59:37.330]  I think I'm the most beautiful experience.
[59:37.330 --> 59:39.730]  I was up in Kulu.
[59:39.730 --> 59:41.370]  That's in the Himalayas.
[59:41.370 --> 59:42.210]  Okay.
[59:42.210 --> 59:43.250]  And there was sadhus there.
[59:43.250 --> 59:46.050]  And sadhus are the Indian holy men
[59:46.050 --> 59:49.010]  that have matted dreadlocks and smoked chillums
[59:49.010 --> 59:52.490]  from morning till night in honor of Shiva there.
[59:52.490 --> 59:54.070]  God of destruction.
[59:54.070 --> 59:55.650]  God of destruction.
[01:00:00.690 --> 01:00:04.950]  And they said they'd take us up into the mountains
[01:00:04.950 --> 01:00:07.390]  to show their favorite plants
[01:00:07.390 --> 01:00:09.670]  because in the valleys you had these enormous
[01:00:09.670 --> 01:00:13.270]  six to eight meter tall marijuana plants growing
[01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:15.910]  but they didn't think much of them.
[01:00:15.910 --> 01:00:20.230]  So we went up about six hours to get to more
[01:00:20.230 --> 01:00:22.190]  or less to the tree line.
[01:00:22.190 --> 01:00:27.190]  And then in mountain, if there was any kind of hollow
[01:00:27.550 --> 01:00:29.990]  at the bottom, there would be some scraggly
[01:00:29.990 --> 01:00:34.110]  marijuana plants standing with tiny buds.
[01:00:34.110 --> 01:00:37.150]  And the thing was those hollows in wintertime
[01:00:37.150 --> 01:00:39.190]  had been covered with snow.
[01:00:39.190 --> 01:00:44.190]  So these were actually second year marijuana plants.
[01:00:45.230 --> 01:00:49.310]  And they grew extremely woody little branches
[01:00:49.310 --> 01:00:54.070]  and woody or in small buds, but we rubbed them
[01:00:54.070 --> 01:00:56.750]  immediately took the hash off our hands,
[01:00:56.750 --> 01:00:59.990]  put it in the chillum and smoked it.
[01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:03.510]  And I think that was my most memorable smoke.
[01:01:03.510 --> 01:01:05.850]  I remember coming down that mountain.
[01:01:08.670 --> 01:01:12.550]  Like on acid, the sounds were just incredible.
[01:01:12.550 --> 01:01:13.470]  Everything.
[01:01:13.470 --> 01:01:14.310]  Yeah.
[01:01:14.310 --> 01:01:16.110]  That was my most special smoke.
[01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:18.750]  That's awesome.
[01:01:19.110 --> 01:01:20.470]  You may have been going down the mountain
[01:01:20.470 --> 01:01:23.190]  but you were still getting high on the mountain.
[01:01:23.190 --> 01:01:25.070]  I was very high on the mountain.
[01:01:28.070 --> 01:01:29.990]  I got high on top of the mountain.
[01:01:31.190 --> 01:01:33.030]  Yes, that would be amazing.
[01:01:33.030 --> 01:01:37.430]  I have a friend, I do a little bit of writing
[01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:42.430]  for Sensey Seeds and my friend who works there in Amsterdam.
[01:01:43.510 --> 01:01:47.790]  He told me stories of his travels and making the charis
[01:01:47.790 --> 01:01:49.030]  just hand rub.
[01:01:49.030 --> 01:01:51.950]  That's something that I've, again, I've not experienced
[01:01:51.950 --> 01:01:54.670]  just geographically where I'm located.
[01:01:54.670 --> 01:01:55.930]  It's not common.
[01:01:57.310 --> 01:02:00.190]  So that is a kind of a cool thing.
[01:02:00.190 --> 01:02:03.390]  But I tell you, it's not a very economical way
[01:02:03.390 --> 01:02:05.470]  to collect hash.
[01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:10.430]  You only get a low percentage of the total.
[01:02:11.350 --> 01:02:12.190]  Right.
[01:02:12.190 --> 01:02:16.150]  Although they do go back to the same buds a few days later
[01:02:16.150 --> 01:02:18.390]  and there'll be new crystals.
[01:02:18.390 --> 01:02:20.790]  Maybe it's not so bad, I don't know.
[01:02:20.790 --> 01:02:24.110]  But yeah, it's also very nice.
[01:02:25.510 --> 01:02:28.430]  Yeah, that would be wonderful.
[01:02:29.990 --> 01:02:34.990]  Have you ever just for personal uses used hash in food
[01:02:35.950 --> 01:02:39.590]  or maybe infused it into your coffee or honey?
[01:02:39.590 --> 01:02:42.090]  Is that a delivery method that you enjoy?
[01:02:43.090 --> 01:02:44.090]  Not really.
[01:02:46.290 --> 01:02:48.130]  It usually just puts me to sleep
[01:02:48.130 --> 01:02:52.810]  and I'm quite a busy kind of running around kind of person
[01:02:52.810 --> 01:02:54.010]  during the day.
[01:02:54.010 --> 01:02:57.410]  So it doesn't suit me to eat an edible or two
[01:02:57.410 --> 01:02:58.250]  and fall asleep.
[01:02:58.250 --> 01:03:01.490]  No, no, it doesn't.
[01:03:01.490 --> 01:03:04.250]  Yeah, those are better for the nighttime.
[01:03:04.250 --> 01:03:07.730]  Keep them till nighttime and then I enjoy them
[01:03:07.730 --> 01:03:08.950]  and have a good sleep.
[01:03:08.950 --> 01:03:09.790]  Yeah.
[01:03:09.790 --> 01:03:10.970]  Good, good.
[01:03:10.970 --> 01:03:13.730]  And I know it is evening there.
[01:03:13.730 --> 01:03:14.630]  I appreciate that.
[01:03:14.630 --> 01:03:17.370]  I know you're about nine hours ahead of where I'm at.
[01:03:18.290 --> 01:03:21.610]  And we are kind of at around the one hour mark.
[01:03:21.610 --> 01:03:23.330]  I know I asked for an hour of time
[01:03:23.330 --> 01:03:27.130]  and I absolutely appreciate your time today.
[01:03:27.130 --> 01:03:29.090]  And I wanna be respectful of it.
[01:03:29.890 --> 01:03:32.550]  But I do want to maybe chat
[01:03:32.550 --> 01:03:34.290]  if you guys have any quick questions,
[01:03:34.290 --> 01:03:37.250]  toss in there and we can get them to Mila.
[01:03:37.250 --> 01:03:39.730]  But I also always like to give the guests,
[01:03:39.730 --> 01:03:43.930]  kind of give you the floor to talk about anything
[01:03:43.930 --> 01:03:45.170]  that you'd like to talk about,
[01:03:45.170 --> 01:03:48.410]  maybe what you're doing or some hopes
[01:03:48.410 --> 01:03:52.010]  or maybe a bit of history that I forgot to even ask about.
[01:03:53.970 --> 01:03:57.770]  The history is endless, but I want to ask you,
[01:03:57.770 --> 01:03:58.930]  have you got my book?
[01:03:58.930 --> 01:04:01.450]  I would like to send you a copy.
[01:04:01.450 --> 01:04:02.730]  I would love to.
[01:04:02.730 --> 01:04:06.210]  Yes, and I'll get it off to you.
[01:04:06.210 --> 01:04:08.090]  Thank you so much.
[01:04:08.090 --> 01:04:10.850]  People can also order it on the web shop.
[01:04:12.250 --> 01:04:15.570]  Yes, let me pull that up here real quick.
[01:04:15.570 --> 01:04:16.770]  Thank you very much.
[01:04:16.770 --> 01:04:18.530]  I was actually hoping to order one
[01:04:18.530 --> 01:04:21.890]  and I was gonna ask maybe if you can sign that there.
[01:04:24.370 --> 01:04:25.490]  Oh, that is awesome.
[01:04:25.490 --> 01:04:28.050]  And again, this is very fun.
[01:04:28.050 --> 01:04:28.890]  This is such an honor.
[01:04:28.890 --> 01:04:31.690]  You're an innovator.
[01:04:31.690 --> 01:04:33.210]  And on top of that,
[01:04:33.210 --> 01:04:37.130]  I usually don't like to distinguish male versus female,
[01:04:37.130 --> 01:04:39.210]  but I realized that there absolutely
[01:04:39.210 --> 01:04:44.210]  is a harder path for females oftentimes in this journey.
[01:04:45.490 --> 01:04:50.290]  I never really had the jealousy of competing with males
[01:04:50.290 --> 01:04:52.130]  because I had a different product.
[01:04:52.130 --> 01:04:52.970]  Yep.
[01:04:52.970 --> 01:04:53.810]  Yeah.
[01:04:53.810 --> 01:04:56.890]  Yep, and I always say,
[01:04:58.170 --> 01:05:01.970]  anybody successful or doing what they truly love,
[01:05:01.970 --> 01:05:05.130]  they're gonna do it even if nobody is looking.
[01:05:05.130 --> 01:05:09.330]  And that's the personality that succeeds,
[01:05:09.330 --> 01:05:12.170]  and that's what takes people to the next level.
[01:05:12.170 --> 01:05:15.570]  And you definitely embody that.
[01:05:15.570 --> 01:05:17.690]  You'd be doing it if nobody was looking.
[01:05:18.530 --> 01:05:21.490]  So we are, we're looking, we're watching
[01:05:21.490 --> 01:05:22.650]  and we're enjoying it.
[01:05:22.650 --> 01:05:26.010]  So thank you very much for that.
[01:05:26.010 --> 01:05:29.370]  Let me, I'm gonna pop up the books here real quick
[01:05:29.370 --> 01:05:30.570]  that you have available.
[01:05:30.570 --> 01:05:32.730]  And again, everybody,
[01:05:32.730 --> 01:05:37.050]  her Instagram and the website pollinator.nl
[01:05:37.050 --> 01:05:40.570]  are in the show notes down below.
[01:05:40.570 --> 01:05:43.290]  So easy to click onto it.
[01:05:43.290 --> 01:05:45.970]  And I'm just right here at the website,
[01:05:45.970 --> 01:05:48.010]  pollinator.nl right now.
[01:05:48.010 --> 01:05:51.930]  I've gone over, I've clicked on books and here we go.
[01:05:51.930 --> 01:05:54.930]  We've got a couple, well, a couple,
[01:05:54.930 --> 01:05:58.250]  we've got two, 34, 24.
[01:05:58.250 --> 01:06:00.010]  You've been busy.
[01:06:00.050 --> 01:06:02.890]  We used to have a big book collection,
[01:06:02.890 --> 01:06:05.330]  but lately I think more and more people
[01:06:05.330 --> 01:06:07.410]  read everything online.
[01:06:07.410 --> 01:06:10.690]  And books seem to be coming a bit less popular.
[01:06:12.970 --> 01:06:16.290]  We don't really order many new ones in.
[01:06:16.290 --> 01:06:18.970]  Okay, I'm gonna be one of those dinosaurs.
[01:06:18.970 --> 01:06:21.010]  I still like reading the book.
[01:06:21.010 --> 01:06:22.330]  I like touching it.
[01:06:22.330 --> 01:06:24.850]  I like it when I'm nodding out at night,
[01:06:24.850 --> 01:06:26.610]  hits my face, wakes me back up.
[01:06:26.610 --> 01:06:29.730]  I get at least two more pages in before I put it down.
[01:06:30.370 --> 01:06:31.210]  Can't do that.
[01:06:31.210 --> 01:06:33.490]  I'm very ready to sell lots of my book.
[01:06:35.290 --> 01:06:36.490]  Can't do that.
[01:06:36.490 --> 01:06:39.410]  In Spanish, English.
[01:06:39.410 --> 01:06:41.650]  And when I get to Brazil,
[01:06:41.650 --> 01:06:44.250]  they've translated into Portuguese
[01:06:44.250 --> 01:06:48.370]  and there'll be a Portuguese available also.
[01:06:48.370 --> 01:06:49.730]  That's amazing.
[01:06:49.730 --> 01:06:51.410]  That is, that is fun.
[01:06:51.410 --> 01:06:52.610]  And congratulations,
[01:06:52.610 --> 01:06:53.930]  because again, that just,
[01:06:53.930 --> 01:06:57.250]  that opens up the knowledge to hundreds
[01:06:57.250 --> 01:06:58.530]  of thousands of people
[01:06:58.530 --> 01:07:01.370]  that didn't have the opportunity before.
[01:07:01.370 --> 01:07:04.210]  It's great that this, you know,
[01:07:04.210 --> 01:07:07.930]  94 was when you came up with the pollinator,
[01:07:07.930 --> 01:07:11.050]  but we're still spreading the education
[01:07:11.050 --> 01:07:13.410]  to areas where it's still new.
[01:07:13.410 --> 01:07:14.450]  That's fascinating.
[01:07:14.450 --> 01:07:15.290]  I love it.
[01:07:15.290 --> 01:07:16.650]  We're still producing them
[01:07:16.650 --> 01:07:19.010]  and still selling them and everything.
[01:07:19.010 --> 01:07:20.250]  Yeah, it's amazing.
[01:07:22.010 --> 01:07:26.050]  I would never have imagined when we built the first three,
[01:07:26.050 --> 01:07:27.810]  how the future would look.
[01:07:29.130 --> 01:07:30.810]  No, no.
[01:07:30.810 --> 01:07:35.810]  Well, any other plans for the future before we go?
[01:07:36.490 --> 01:07:39.370]  I know you've got the South American tour
[01:07:39.370 --> 01:07:41.450]  coming up with Abidu, but.
[01:07:41.450 --> 01:07:45.730]  My secret wish is to get a small piece of land
[01:07:45.730 --> 01:07:49.850]  and to build a house of hemp, wood and loam
[01:07:50.970 --> 01:07:53.570]  be completely CO neutral.
[01:07:53.570 --> 01:07:58.130]  And I think by now I would also love to design the spaces
[01:07:58.770 --> 01:07:59.610]  to live in.
[01:07:59.610 --> 01:08:01.890]  You know, you always end up in a house
[01:08:01.890 --> 01:08:03.410]  that somebody else designed.
[01:08:05.050 --> 01:08:07.290]  But I think I figured out how I would want
[01:08:07.290 --> 01:08:09.010]  my own house to be.
[01:08:10.370 --> 01:08:13.490]  That might take a while and maybe it doesn't ever happen
[01:08:13.490 --> 01:08:16.530]  because there's countless problems on the way
[01:08:16.530 --> 01:08:19.690]  like building licenses.
[01:08:19.690 --> 01:08:21.650]  They don't really want.
[01:08:21.650 --> 01:08:23.730]  Yeah, they don't want grass on the roof.
[01:08:23.730 --> 01:08:26.370]  They don't want hemp in bungalows.
[01:08:26.370 --> 01:08:29.970]  They want brick buildings with a roof like that
[01:08:29.970 --> 01:08:30.890]  and with a flower.
[01:08:32.530 --> 01:08:34.210]  But one day, who knows?
[01:08:34.210 --> 01:08:37.970]  Yes, one day you might travel to another country
[01:08:37.970 --> 01:08:40.450]  and you might find the right place.
[01:08:40.450 --> 01:08:42.690]  That is very possible, yes.
[01:08:42.690 --> 01:08:44.370]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:08:44.370 --> 01:08:49.370]  It's never too late to find a new home if it's home, so.
[01:08:49.370 --> 01:08:53.010]  Yeah, but my heart is with my kids and my grandkids
[01:08:53.010 --> 01:08:55.050]  and they live in Holland, so.
[01:08:55.090 --> 01:08:56.970]  Oh yes, that is.
[01:08:56.970 --> 01:09:00.050]  I'll be home somewhere else for part of the year, but.
[01:09:01.770 --> 01:09:02.730]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:09:02.730 --> 01:09:03.930]  Home is where the heart is.
[01:09:03.930 --> 01:09:04.810]  That's awesome.
[01:09:04.810 --> 01:09:07.490]  And hopefully one day I will be there
[01:09:07.490 --> 01:09:09.530]  and I will send you an email.
[01:09:09.530 --> 01:09:12.010]  We were actually looking for homes while we were over there.
[01:09:12.010 --> 01:09:14.650]  We want to move there.
[01:09:14.650 --> 01:09:17.170]  We've been working on it for a few years.
[01:09:18.210 --> 01:09:22.610]  The process isn't the easiest, but we're, you know,
[01:09:22.610 --> 01:09:24.250]  again, we're just going forward.
[01:09:24.290 --> 01:09:27.210]  Little steps every day gets you there in the end.
[01:09:27.210 --> 01:09:28.410]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:09:28.410 --> 01:09:30.210]  Be patient, yeah.
[01:09:30.210 --> 01:09:31.370]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:09:31.370 --> 01:09:34.770]  Well, thank you for your time so much this evening.
[01:09:34.770 --> 01:09:36.090]  Truly appreciate it.
[01:09:36.090 --> 01:09:37.610]  Always gonna remember it.
[01:09:38.730 --> 01:09:40.930]  It's had such a nice time talking to you.
[01:09:40.930 --> 01:09:43.810]  Thank you very much to invite me.
[01:09:43.810 --> 01:09:46.850]  And yeah, it was a very nice conversation.
[01:09:46.850 --> 01:09:48.210]  I enjoyed myself.
[01:09:49.130 --> 01:09:50.330]  Thank you.
[01:09:50.330 --> 01:09:51.170]  Thank you.
[01:09:51.170 --> 01:09:54.130]  Well, you have a wonderful evening and everybody in chat,
[01:09:55.010 --> 01:09:56.610]  thank you so much for joining us.
[01:09:56.610 --> 01:10:01.250]  We appreciate you and we will see you shortly in the future.
[01:10:01.250 --> 01:10:02.090]  Yes.
[01:10:02.090 --> 01:10:04.810]  I will end the broadcast.
[01:10:04.810 --> 01:10:05.650]  All right.
