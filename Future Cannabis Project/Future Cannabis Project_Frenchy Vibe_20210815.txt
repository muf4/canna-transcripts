It's touching the top a little bit.
Cheers.
Hey, welcome to Meadowlands.
So today we are blessed to be smoking Frenchie Canole.
It's hash.
It's a white buffalo he made himself.
And Jacob brought Infinite Euphoria from Flower Days Farm.
So we got those stacked on top of each other in this amazing vaporized hookah.
See, we're all doing this together, community style.
Wow, the flavor is unbelievable.
Smooth, tastes amazing.
Tastes kind of like wedding cake almost to me.
But I got a stupid palate, so who knows.
But man, being able to do something like this at Meadowlands with such amazing people
and a community event like a hookah is a special time in the cannabis industry.
Look at it bubbling in there.
That's awesome.
Oh yeah.
Amazing.
Try to take this thing out of my hand.
Go ahead.
