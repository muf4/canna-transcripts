[00:01.280 --> 00:07.240]  All right, hello everybody. Good morning. Welcome to the East Bay Seed
[00:07.240 --> 00:14.060]  Collective Show. Our guest today is Jeremy Klettel. That's correct, right?
[00:14.060 --> 00:21.560]  Klett-Keith. Close, yeah, it's good. Klett-Keith of Davis Farms. And today we're going to
[00:21.560 --> 00:29.200]  talk about smokable hemp. I feel like it kind of has a little bit of a bad name
[00:29.200 --> 00:35.160]  in the community, so it's good for us to get some, you know, clean information so
[00:35.160 --> 00:42.840]  that we can, you know, make the best decisions for ourself. I also found, I
[00:42.840 --> 00:49.640]  think, you know, like the breeding acumen that you have is pretty advanced and, you
[00:49.640 --> 00:56.680]  know, I'm really excited to dive into, you know, how you guys select, how you, you
[00:56.680 --> 01:03.200]  know, how you breed the cannabis that you guys are growing. So I guess my, I
[01:03.200 --> 01:09.040]  wanted to do like a little get to know you question. So I was thinking, are you
[01:09.040 --> 01:13.080]  into sports? Yeah, I'm into sports a little bit. Most of the sports that I'm
[01:13.080 --> 01:18.600]  into are probably motor sports. Okay. I like grassroots motor sports a lot.
[01:18.600 --> 01:24.840]  So are you like a motor, are you a motor biker? Yeah, I do like motocross, but I
[01:24.920 --> 01:32.640]  like MotoGP. I like road racing when it comes to motorcycles and I like F1. So I
[01:32.640 --> 01:37.360]  like that the high end, like the where we're pushing the envelope, non-homologated
[01:37.400 --> 01:41.680]  vehicles, vehicles that are purposely built for racing. Interesting. Do you do
[01:41.680 --> 01:45.680]  any of that yourself or do you just watch it? No, I have in the past. I've
[01:45.680 --> 01:50.840]  been involved in racing, mostly rally racing. So I was involved in rally racing
[01:50.840 --> 01:57.240]  Subarus, early mid 2000s. Haven't done it for a while, but I was involved with
[01:57.240 --> 02:00.920]  the Subaru Pro Rally team for a couple of years doing logistical coordination.
[02:00.920 --> 02:05.440]  So I wasn't a driver, but I was a part of a race team, had a lot of fun doing
[02:05.440 --> 02:10.120]  that. That's pretty sick. I bet you you're a exciting driver to be with.
[02:11.240 --> 02:15.560]  Probably so, probably so. You know, I would elaborate on that though and say
[02:15.560 --> 02:20.040]  when I tell you that I haven't done that for so many years, it really, it shows
[02:20.040 --> 02:23.800]  you that back in the day when we were growing, we had a little bit more free
[02:23.800 --> 02:27.120]  time. The grow was there. We go out and figure things that we want to do. I
[02:27.120 --> 02:31.600]  think in the last 10 years, it's just become a full time, you know, a full
[02:31.600 --> 02:34.480]  time deal where you don't have a lot of opportunity. You're just, you're
[02:34.520 --> 02:37.600]  breathing, you're building company. You're just trying to get out there and
[02:37.680 --> 02:42.440]  make sure that you stay relevant. So lost some of those, you know, joys and
[02:42.440 --> 02:44.720]  passions, but still love watching it.
[02:45.160 --> 02:49.560]  For sure, for sure. Actually, my neighbors are into motor, I guess,
[02:49.600 --> 02:55.120]  motocross, like motorbike racing, and I can hear them tuning their bikes. They
[02:55.120 --> 02:57.040]  sound pretty badass next door.
[02:57.320 --> 03:01.760]  Oh, the technology is getting crazy on motocross. Like the suspension alone, the
[03:01.760 --> 03:05.680]  suspension technology improvements that have happened over the last 15, 20 years
[03:05.680 --> 03:10.600]  are pretty crazy. That and snowmobiles as well. It's a, it's radical. I mean,
[03:10.600 --> 03:15.480]  we're in a time where technology is, you know, going in some of the right
[03:15.480 --> 03:19.040]  directions, at least I think as far as giving us some joy, some pleasure,
[03:19.080 --> 03:21.040]  certainly when it comes to that motorsport.
[03:21.680 --> 03:28.120]  That's awesome. Yeah. Um, so I guess let's, so you know, jumping into
[03:28.120 --> 03:36.240]  cannabis, you are a cultivator and a breeder, but you specialize in, I believe
[03:36.240 --> 03:38.800]  it's type three. Is that correct? Type three cannabis?
[03:38.800 --> 03:43.680]  We have, we have. And so what I'd say is that the company, you know, I come out
[03:43.680 --> 03:49.600]  of the Oregon medical market, essentially, like I spent from 2007 on
[03:49.600 --> 03:53.800]  to 14, here working primarily in the Oregon medical market, and we became
[03:53.800 --> 04:00.080]  known as producers of like CBD one to one ratios, two to one ratios with THC
[04:00.080 --> 04:04.320]  10 to one. So these type two plants is what those essentially are. And that's
[04:04.400 --> 04:08.960]  what led us, you know, into this direction of doing type three, mostly the
[04:08.960 --> 04:13.080]  fact that there was just a void there that needed to be filled for genetics.
[04:13.080 --> 04:16.720]  And we had, you know, or I had a lot of experience breeding, you know,
[04:16.720 --> 04:20.720]  genetics. And so we rather than lean to the, where the masses were,
[04:20.720 --> 04:26.400]  which is back into recreational, we took a pivot and, or I took a pivot
[04:26.400 --> 04:31.320]  and went into type three. Yes, exactly. Went into CBD. And can you maybe
[04:31.720 --> 04:36.240]  clarify the three different types, please? Yes, absolutely. So when we're talking
[04:36.240 --> 04:40.680]  about type one cannabis plants, we're talking about high THC, low CBD plants.
[04:40.680 --> 04:45.960]  So intoxicating plants. And all of the hybrids that we're looking at,
[04:45.960 --> 04:49.400]  and smoking, and the recreational market, all the polyhybrids, these are all
[04:50.640 --> 04:55.760]  type one plants. Type two plants, which are pretty rare still in the marketplace,
[04:55.760 --> 04:59.680]  but I think they're starting to take a foothold, are plants that are
[05:00.400 --> 05:04.480]  mixed ratios. So you have a decent amount of CBD, a decent amount of THC,
[05:04.880 --> 05:11.200]  and those can start from one to one, all the way up to like 10
[05:11.200 --> 05:14.000]  to one, 15 to one. I think you hit about 20 to one,
[05:14.440 --> 05:21.320]  and you move into the type three ratios, right? So all your mixes of CBD,
[05:21.320 --> 05:24.720]  THC are all type two plants. And then the type three plants are all
[05:25.240 --> 05:32.120]  non intoxicating, high CBD, low THC plants. There's also a type four plant
[05:32.120 --> 05:36.240]  that I've heard referenced as a CBG plant, leaning type four,
[05:36.240 --> 05:39.440]  and I've even heard some conversation about industrial being type five,
[05:39.440 --> 05:43.320]  but essentially where we are when we talk about cannabinoid production,
[05:43.600 --> 05:46.360]  we're in this type one, type two, type three world.
[05:46.360 --> 05:56.160]  Okay. Okay, so we're mostly talking about type three, those are the type...
[05:56.480 --> 06:00.440]  And just to clarify it, the CBD is always first when you say
[06:00.440 --> 06:04.960]  like a one to one, it's CBD first and then THC. Yeah, and
[06:05.800 --> 06:11.080]  the ratios honestly can go either way, but I was referring to CBD to
[06:11.080 --> 06:15.200]  THC. Exactly, yes. When I go 10 to one, I'm talking 10 times
[06:15.240 --> 06:18.560]  the CBD than the THC, and when we hit 20 to one,
[06:20.000 --> 06:23.560]  let's call that like an ACDC, which a lot of guys are familiar
[06:23.560 --> 06:28.800]  with in our world, that's like a 1% and a 20% CBD. So it's
[06:28.800 --> 06:32.880]  a 1% THC and a 20% CBD. That would be right on the
[06:32.880 --> 06:36.640]  cusp of being a type three plant or right there at type three.
[06:37.240 --> 06:42.280]  But in general, people, they usually put the CBD first when they do
[06:42.680 --> 06:48.320]  the ratios. Generally speaking, that is the way that the ratios are driven,
[06:48.320 --> 06:53.560]  although, Jamal, this stuff's all new. A lot of these monikers just haven't
[06:53.560 --> 06:56.840]  been there, a lot of the phrasing is not really established,
[06:56.840 --> 07:00.800]  and it's one of the neat things about our industry is we're creating all
[07:00.800 --> 07:05.480]  of this as we go in a lot of cases. For sure.
[07:05.920 --> 07:13.800]  And then let's jump into a quick history of hemp in the US.
[07:13.800 --> 07:18.000]  That pertains to your breeding project. You bet, you bet. And I do
[07:18.000 --> 07:22.680]  wanna say, I do wanna establish that I come out of type one,
[07:22.680 --> 07:25.840]  so I'm all the way back in the early 90s doing what we
[07:25.840 --> 07:31.400]  all did, producing high THC plants indoors, and then just found CBD working
[07:31.400 --> 07:35.600]  in Switzerland in the late 90s and pivoted into understanding that,
[07:36.080 --> 07:39.640]  the high efficacy, basically, how these are helping patients, helping people
[07:39.640 --> 07:42.720]  with seizure disorder and autism and so on and so forth.
[07:42.720 --> 07:45.680]  So we really, I come from that type one world back in the
[07:45.680 --> 07:49.800]  day. And to close that piece about one, two, three, and four,
[07:50.400 --> 07:58.120]  anybody who's interested, there is an article on Hoku Seeds website in their
[07:58.120 --> 08:03.880]  blog section that you can look at that has an incredible detail on
[08:03.880 --> 08:08.640]  this type one, two, and three plant. So Hoku, if anybody's familiar with
[08:08.640 --> 08:12.720]  them, those guys are pretty solid and you can cite this same work
[08:13.200 --> 08:18.080]  on their website. But yeah, hemp history, essentially. I mean, hemp in human
[08:18.080 --> 08:22.720]  history goes back a long way, right? We're talking 8,000 plus years of clear
[08:22.720 --> 08:27.720]  human history with hemp, which says to me, probably a lot longer than
[08:27.760 --> 08:34.280]  that, right? But fast forward, by the time we... American history,
[08:34.280 --> 08:37.160]  by the time we founded this country, our founding fathers were pretty well
[08:37.160 --> 08:42.040]  aware that hemp was a critical crop, it's a crucial crop for us
[08:42.040 --> 08:46.440]  to be growing. And so I think it was even Jefferson said that
[08:46.440 --> 08:49.520]  every one acre farm in the US should have a quarter acre of
[08:49.520 --> 08:55.080]  hemp in production. So these guys knew the value. They brought hemp from
[08:56.000 --> 09:01.000]  China and India, and the uses are debatable. We know that they fed
[09:01.000 --> 09:04.280]  it to their livestock, so that's one that we see.
[09:04.960 --> 09:09.000]  They were clearly making textiles out of it, so they were using the
[09:09.000 --> 09:13.480]  fiber and the grain elements of it. There are places where they talk
[09:13.480 --> 09:19.920]  about... Where they talk about separating the seed and so on and so
[09:19.920 --> 09:22.920]  forth, and there's a lot of debate about what they were doing with
[09:22.960 --> 09:25.480]  that. But I think just knowing what we know today,
[09:25.480 --> 09:29.040]  they probably weren't consuming cannabis. They certainly weren't concerned
[09:29.040 --> 09:32.080]  about breeding out the psychoactivity of it. That didn't come for a
[09:32.080 --> 09:36.000]  long... For another couple of hundred years. So just to jump in,
[09:36.000 --> 09:38.240]  so that type of plant was kind of like an all of the
[09:38.240 --> 09:41.840]  above type of plant? It probably was, but I have to believe that
[09:41.840 --> 09:46.360]  they were selecting plants for purpose. It's not like we weren't intelligent
[09:46.360 --> 09:48.800]  enough to do that, so I imagine they had grain plants,
[09:48.800 --> 09:52.440]  fiber plants. Okay. And then I'm guessing they had cannabinoid plants.
[09:52.720 --> 09:58.400]  If you look all the way up to 1900, 1920, a good percentage
[09:58.400 --> 10:01.800]  of the medicine over the counter... Well, over the counter is funny,
[10:01.800 --> 10:05.200]  we didn't describe so much, but the medicines that were available treating
[10:05.200 --> 10:10.760]  ailments were cannabis derived. So we definitely had this in the world
[10:10.760 --> 10:13.280]  for medicine for a while, so I have to believe they were
[10:13.280 --> 10:18.240]  looking at cannabinoids as a selection factor as well. But anyway,
[10:18.240 --> 10:22.000]  you fast forward, we get to the Civil War. We developed a pretty
[10:22.040 --> 10:27.320]  incredible hemp industry. Hemp is really... It's labor intensive to decorticate,
[10:28.080 --> 10:32.560]  particularly to harvest, to separate the fibers, it takes some time and
[10:32.560 --> 10:35.840]  energy. And so at the end of the Civil War,
[10:37.080 --> 10:40.440]  labor changed a little bit, and the cost of labor started to be...
[10:40.440 --> 10:44.600]  It started to make an impact, and over the next 60 or 70
[10:44.600 --> 10:47.040]  years, hemp started to fall by the wayside and
[10:48.040 --> 10:52.160]  was replaced by cotton, so a lot of cotton, and then the paper
[10:52.160 --> 10:54.680]  pulp aspect of it was replaced a lot by timber.
[10:55.520 --> 11:02.160]  And we get to the 1930s, and we've certainly created some industry.
[11:02.240 --> 11:06.800]  We have some guys like DuPont out there and another guy, William Randolph
[11:06.800 --> 11:10.560]  Hurst, who's a paper and timber magnate. And about that time,
[11:10.560 --> 11:14.320]  the decorticator comes along, it's invented, and these guys saw, they
[11:14.360 --> 11:18.120]  recognized that this was gonna be a threat to their industries.
[11:19.760 --> 11:23.520]  Hurst, being a brilliant man, politically connected, and
[11:24.280 --> 11:28.480]  also owning a ton of newspapers, he started a yellow journalism campaign,
[11:28.480 --> 11:32.360]  which was targeted at the psychoactive nature of cannabis and causing a
[11:32.360 --> 11:34.400]  lot of problems. So that whole
[11:36.880 --> 11:41.680]  reefer madness, essentially, is what we're talking about. And that yellow
[11:41.680 --> 11:46.000]  journalism campaign led into some legislation that came and swept out
[11:46.440 --> 11:50.160]  cannabis in 1937 for a form, basically, of tax act, and they said
[11:50.160 --> 11:53.720]  they were gonna issue stamps to regulate cannabis, but they really never
[11:53.720 --> 11:59.760]  issued them. And so effectively, it made cannabis hemp illegal in 1937
[11:59.880 --> 12:02.400]  to facilitate these guys' industries, mostly.
[12:04.320 --> 12:07.560]  We realized how bad of a mistake that was right away when it
[12:07.600 --> 12:11.520]  went into the war effort, because in 1941, we
[12:12.960 --> 12:16.840]  started the Hemp for Victory Act again, and pulled out all the seed
[12:16.840 --> 12:20.560]  that the government had swiftly pulled off of the market from the families
[12:20.560 --> 12:24.560]  that received producers, and put it back into play. And
[12:25.800 --> 12:29.200]  we produced hemp. Matter of fact, you were given some good credit for
[12:29.200 --> 12:31.880]  producing hemp during World War II, if you did, for rope,
[12:31.880 --> 12:37.040]  sails, other aspects. I understand that they even used hemp seed in
[12:37.040 --> 12:42.800]  battleships and the big turrets. There was a cavity in between there on
[12:42.800 --> 12:47.040]  those rotating turrets that they would dump hemp seed into, and as the
[12:47.040 --> 12:51.360]  gun fired, the repercussion of the gun, or the concussion of the gun,
[12:51.360 --> 12:54.960]  would break apart the hemp seed, and that would lubricate the turret.
[12:54.960 --> 12:58.520]  And then I heard that they would even take the byproduct of that
[12:58.520 --> 13:00.680]  and take it back to the base and feed it to the chickens
[13:00.680 --> 13:04.080]  as a high protein source. So it was used for a ton of
[13:04.120 --> 13:07.440]  different things in the war effort, including, like I say, rope, sails,
[13:07.440 --> 13:11.080]  lubricants. And then after the war, it went back to being illegal,
[13:12.720 --> 13:16.600]  brought it back again in the Korean War effort, because we recognize the
[13:16.600 --> 13:20.400]  value of it, but it really shows that we had some strong industry,
[13:20.400 --> 13:25.160]  people in place politically, and they made a power play to essentially push
[13:25.160 --> 13:30.160]  this thing out. There's where we ended up with illegal cannabis and hemp
[13:30.200 --> 13:34.520]  in the States for so long. Interesting, interesting.
[13:36.240 --> 13:42.520]  So then what year did hemp start to become legal?
[13:43.480 --> 13:47.120]  So now here I'm dating myself a little bit, because I'm 30 years
[13:47.120 --> 13:49.880]  in cannabis and been a hempster for so long,
[13:50.520 --> 13:54.440]  and was around when this all started to happen again. It was France
[13:54.440 --> 14:00.080]  and Canada that pushed this effort. We're like, hey, we don't care
[14:00.080 --> 14:05.320]  about THC, you can't stop this important industrial crop from being produced.
[14:05.800 --> 14:10.200]  And so they pushed really hard against the... And I just say,
[14:10.280 --> 14:14.600]  put it out there, against the global drug policy enforcers, which are us,
[14:14.600 --> 14:17.440]  the United States, and started some great
[14:18.040 --> 14:22.560]  hemp programs, worked very hard to create non intoxicating
[14:23.320 --> 14:26.720]  plants. Going back to that time, THC was the crux of this,
[14:26.760 --> 14:30.880]  and where does the THC threshold need to be to qualify as hemp,
[14:30.880 --> 14:36.040]  and how much plasticity in the plant allows over years THC to increase.
[14:36.040 --> 14:40.520]  And so in the 90s, they set the mark at 0.3 total THC,
[14:41.240 --> 14:44.880]  got hemp programs going again for industrial purposes, and that just started
[14:44.880 --> 14:48.680]  the movement. And the movement had very slow,
[14:49.800 --> 14:53.880]  steady progress, I think mostly led by people that were just,
[14:53.960 --> 14:57.320]  like I say, hempsters, people that were fringe people,
[14:58.040 --> 15:03.000]  until we started seeing the legalization of cannabis more from
[15:04.120 --> 15:09.280]  state to state. And I think that sort of drove the hemp push,
[15:09.480 --> 15:13.160]  and then really where this defining moment that brought us to where we
[15:13.160 --> 15:19.280]  are today was when Colorado, and then followed by Oregon, created a legislative
[15:19.320 --> 15:25.120]  component that actually legalized CBD as an end use for industrial hemp.
[15:25.600 --> 15:28.160]  So then it meant all of a sudden, wait, if we have a
[15:28.560 --> 15:33.080]  plant that produces a bunch of cannabinoids and terpenes, as long as it's
[15:33.080 --> 15:37.800]  below 0.3 in THC, well, dang, it can be produced and it can
[15:37.800 --> 15:42.680]  be grown under this industrial caveat, and man, then it just went off
[15:42.680 --> 15:48.320]  the chains. And as you know, then in 2018, the USDA picked up
[15:48.360 --> 15:51.720]  the federal farm bill and then made that, adopted that federally.
[15:51.720 --> 15:54.400]  So now in 50 states in the US, you can produce
[15:55.720 --> 16:03.560]  terpene rich, stinky, skunky, just has to be CBD leaning cannabis at
[16:03.560 --> 16:06.680]  any scale that you want. So my question is,
[16:08.400 --> 16:13.800]  when I think of the word hemp, I'm assuming like textile non drug use,
[16:13.800 --> 16:16.920]  is there much of that being cultivated in the United States? You know,
[16:16.920 --> 16:21.440]  we started the hemp movement here really like it got... It picked up momentum
[16:21.440 --> 16:26.120]  through CBD. But in the last two to three years, and this also
[16:26.120 --> 16:29.600]  plays to the nascent of the industry, the newness of the industry and
[16:29.600 --> 16:33.400]  the hype nature that everyone's rushing to one segment after another,
[16:33.600 --> 16:39.280]  enough people put pressure on CBD production, over producing, crashing markets,
[16:40.000 --> 16:44.200]  then it started to fuel the industrial push. And over the last...
[16:44.560 --> 16:48.160]  So sorry, about three years ago, you were seeing the first guys trying
[16:48.160 --> 16:53.280]  to import and get seed going for industrial end use into the states.
[16:53.280 --> 16:57.760]  Canada now, Canada has been a massive seed producer. You have Manitoba harvest,
[16:57.760 --> 17:00.760]  but most of the grain like Nutiva, a lot of this is coming
[17:00.760 --> 17:03.080]  out of Canada. So they never stopped. They've been doing it for a
[17:03.080 --> 17:07.680]  long time. But we didn't have the infrastructure in place to process all
[17:07.680 --> 17:11.200]  of this. So about three years ago, people started, but then they had
[17:11.480 --> 17:15.440]  similar problem that people have with CBD. At scale, how do you turn
[17:15.440 --> 17:20.120]  that into an end product, a usable product? Now, over the last couple
[17:20.120 --> 17:24.720]  of years, we're seeing things like hemp trains coming online and decorticators
[17:24.720 --> 17:29.360]  coming online and grain threshers. So there are some end use
[17:30.000 --> 17:33.560]  places starting up in the nation. And I think next year,
[17:33.560 --> 17:38.600]  this coming year, 23, we're gonna see a lot of industrial acres going
[17:38.640 --> 17:42.160]  up in the states. Interesting. So you're saying that one of the biggest...
[17:43.400 --> 17:47.600]  The mechanization of that particular crop has not been developed yet,
[17:47.600 --> 17:51.000]  and so they couldn't essentially grow it on scale, do these large fields
[17:51.000 --> 17:56.480]  because people were hand harvesting fields of hemp. Is that correct? Yeah,
[17:56.920 --> 18:00.920]  not so much the mechanization because you can harvest this stuff with traditional
[18:01.120 --> 18:04.960]  combine headers and things like that, right, with a little bit of modification,
[18:05.240 --> 18:10.840]  but the processing facilities. So all the silage places to store the grain
[18:11.080 --> 18:14.240]  were in place, all of the harvest equipment was in place,
[18:14.240 --> 18:19.160]  it's just a pivot from one crop to another, right? One grain crop
[18:19.160 --> 18:22.560]  to another, but what wasn't in place is all of the appropriate
[18:24.040 --> 18:28.680]  in processing, particularly for fiber. We saw a lot of people grow fiber
[18:28.680 --> 18:33.720]  and then there's no decortication facilities, so they couldn't get that processed
[18:33.760 --> 18:38.600]  into a textile or into paper pulp. What does decortification mean? So
[18:39.480 --> 18:45.760]  decorticating is separating the bast fiber from the herd. So the bast fiber
[18:45.760 --> 18:49.280]  is the key component that we want to create textile or paper,
[18:49.280 --> 18:53.880]  herd has different end uses, so that's what that is, is separating the
[18:53.880 --> 18:59.360]  usable material from not usable material. Okay, okay. That makes sense.
[18:59.360 --> 19:02.400]  Are there... I mean, I guess other countries don't have that because this
[19:02.400 --> 19:07.280]  has never been done on such a large scale. And another fascinating conversation,
[19:07.280 --> 19:13.640]  man, is to look at how nefarious that push to push out hemp was.
[19:14.960 --> 19:19.360]  There was literally a movement to go around Eastern Europe at the end
[19:19.360 --> 19:25.920]  of the Cold War and dismantle all of the decorticating equipment,
[19:25.920 --> 19:29.360]  because there was massive decorticating equipment all over Eastern Europe
[19:29.360 --> 19:34.440]  because that was a... Hemp was still okay. Hump was a primary textile
[19:34.440 --> 19:38.840]  and paper pulp crop, so they had all the equipment and literally,
[19:39.720 --> 19:44.940]  as soon as we made it illegal, they started dismantling any equipment like
[19:44.940 --> 19:48.680]  that and stopping the production of any equipment like that in the states.
[19:48.920 --> 19:51.400]  But then this followed through all the way to...
[19:52.760 --> 19:56.160]  Decades later, when they find a place where all of a sudden this
[19:56.160 --> 19:59.280]  equipment is gonna become available again and it's been sitting in
[20:00.360 --> 20:04.200]  whatever dust on it in a warehouse, they went and dismantled that stuff.
[20:04.200 --> 20:09.640]  Anybody... Any of these... And I guess I would say it's really...
[20:09.880 --> 20:15.000]  At that point, it was probably... I don't know, big ag companies that
[20:15.000 --> 20:18.440]  were doing that. I can't guess. I'd love to hear other people's thoughts
[20:18.440 --> 20:21.560]  on that, but I do know that that's what happened. And similarly,
[20:21.560 --> 20:25.920]  when I think about big ag companies, the same with seed cleaning equipment.
[20:26.760 --> 20:31.760]  To stop people from seed saving, that's one of the big pushes that
[20:31.760 --> 20:37.440]  groups like Monsanto did early on, was to go and dismantle any kind
[20:37.440 --> 20:41.040]  of seed threshing equipment and seed cleaning equipment from people that
[20:41.040 --> 20:45.880]  were seed saving. That's really interesting. I did not think about that.
[20:45.880 --> 20:52.560]  And I mean, I'm a breeder myself and finding seed cleaning and seed counters,
[20:52.920 --> 20:57.520]  it's not the most easy things to find and it's not terribly developed.
[20:57.920 --> 21:03.600]  Right. Interesting. So I just wanna go into like, let's say...
[21:04.680 --> 21:09.920]  So hemp for seeds. So I eat hemp seeds and when you look
[21:09.920 --> 21:12.080]  in the back of the container, they're grown in Manitoba.
[21:13.280 --> 21:17.240]  And I assume that that is a particular variety that they grow
[21:18.080 --> 21:23.080]  for big seeds? Yeah, for grain production. Yeah, you have grain producers
[21:23.080 --> 21:27.040]  like X59 is a primary one. And from a breeding standpoint,
[21:27.040 --> 21:30.400]  I mean, all of us here watching as seed breeders, as cannabis breeders,
[21:30.640 --> 21:34.000]  it's important that we recognize that there hasn't been much
[21:34.480 --> 21:39.880]  improvement in these genetics for 50 or 60 years, right? It's just starting
[21:39.880 --> 21:43.000]  now, but there are leaps and bounds to be made
[21:43.680 --> 21:49.600]  with grain and fiber producers. But yeah, you're right, these are baseline
[21:49.600 --> 21:52.600]  producers that are designed to produce bushels of grain. Yeah.
[21:53.560 --> 21:57.560]  Interesting. And then I assume, do they... Bushels of grains. So I mean,
[21:57.560 --> 22:00.880]  that's essentially like the same talk that you would talk with wheat.
[22:00.880 --> 22:05.440]  Is that correct? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And you talk to Canadian farmers
[22:05.440 --> 22:08.800]  and that's essentially how they look at a hemp crop. It's just another
[22:08.840 --> 22:14.000]  crop to them, corn, wheat, soy, whatever it is, at scale.
[22:15.160 --> 22:21.240]  Interesting. And then, so like for example, for hemp seeds, there's also
[22:21.240 --> 22:24.520]  a machine besides that harvests the seeds that then cracks them,
[22:24.520 --> 22:27.760]  I assume, that cracks them in a very specific way, because there's no
[22:28.480 --> 22:33.680]  extra shell in your hemp seeds? Presses. I imagine that's all pressing oil
[22:33.680 --> 22:38.120]  out of the seed. And first, it's seed threshing and seed cleaning so that
[22:38.120 --> 22:43.000]  you don't have any byproduct in there. But yeah, it's definitely like presses
[22:43.000 --> 22:45.520]  that are pressing oil. And all of this stuff, once you get to
[22:45.520 --> 22:48.920]  there... This has probably been one of the most fascinating things for me
[22:48.920 --> 22:53.560]  as a cannabis breeder is, since I took this pivot into type three
[22:53.560 --> 22:57.080]  and we started producing all of these, literally millions of
[22:58.000 --> 23:03.040]  type three compliant seeds for global market, is how I'm dealing with farmers
[23:03.040 --> 23:05.960]  now and how I'm getting to see a farmer's mentality and where they
[23:05.960 --> 23:10.560]  come from. So yeah, and how much all of the equipment at the
[23:10.560 --> 23:14.160]  end of the day does translate. We have a stickier plant and we
[23:14.160 --> 23:19.200]  have a tougher fiber, so it can create problems for combine heads,
[23:19.200 --> 23:21.960]  but for the most part, a little bit of modification
[23:22.560 --> 23:26.640]  and everything works for hemp. So we're not having to reinvent the wheel,
[23:27.040 --> 23:32.960]  including right down to grain presses. Okay, okay. That's super interesting.
[23:33.440 --> 23:39.520]  So I guess before we... I wanted to dive into your particular breeding
[23:39.520 --> 23:44.160]  project, but I just had a random question. Are you in auto or
[23:44.160 --> 23:50.520]  photo period cultivating? Everything we've done is photo periodic. If you go
[23:50.520 --> 23:56.640]  back to the beginning of when these hemp breeding for CBD started,
[23:57.560 --> 24:00.920]  it was just a wide open field. There weren't a lot of genetics
[24:00.920 --> 24:03.440]  to fill the void. We had a few things the first year that
[24:03.440 --> 24:09.360]  we grew. Hello. We had a few things the first year that we
[24:09.360 --> 24:13.520]  grew from Switzerland that were close to compliant, but there just wasn't
[24:13.520 --> 24:16.040]  a lot of genetics on the marketplace. So
[24:18.400 --> 24:21.600]  the baby just threw me. What was the question? What was the core
[24:21.600 --> 24:26.600]  of the question, Jamal? Basically, I was asking if you were growing autos
[24:27.000 --> 24:32.520]  or photo periods. Yes, yes. So looking at it, we felt that the
[24:32.520 --> 24:37.440]  need would be for full photo periodic plants. We didn't touch anything
[24:37.960 --> 24:42.560]  auto flower related. We were looking for... Think of it this way,
[24:42.560 --> 24:48.440]  we're trying to determine what's gonna grow in the northern hemisphere here,
[24:48.480 --> 24:52.800]  like at our latitudes, what's gonna grow the biggest yield per acre?
[24:52.840 --> 24:58.000]  What's gonna grow the most flower per acre or the most extractable CBD
[24:58.000 --> 25:02.920]  per acre? And to me, we weren't even looking at depth crop type
[25:02.920 --> 25:07.640]  mentality, early harvest mentality. We were looking at it from a one
[25:08.320 --> 25:13.460]  crop full season production mentality. The other thing is the economics of
[25:13.460 --> 25:18.860]  the cost of seed. For a farmer to plant 10,000 auto flowers or
[25:18.900 --> 25:23.720]  15,000 auto flowers per acre three times a year is pretty cost prohibitive
[25:23.720 --> 25:27.340]  for him for seed at the cost of seed. Whereas if he can
[25:27.340 --> 25:33.560]  do close to that in one planting with one set of seed at
[25:33.560 --> 25:38.920]  2,500 to 5,000 per acre... So again, it's economics. So we didn't look
[25:38.920 --> 25:42.920]  at any auto flower initially. Matter of fact, there were almost no auto
[25:42.920 --> 25:46.900]  flower CBD producers. We've had a few of them come online since.
[25:47.700 --> 25:53.900]  But we've produced fully photoperiodic and also the other crux of the problem
[25:53.900 --> 25:58.860]  for these guys was having males in the field. So we've created fully
[25:58.860 --> 26:05.120]  photoperiodic feminized seed for field. And I guess we're dealing with a
[26:05.120 --> 26:10.200]  lot of assumptions. My assumptions were that large field plants were usually
[26:10.200 --> 26:14.880]  on the smaller side. Is that true or are these full size large
[26:14.900 --> 26:19.480]  algar plants? They're full size and it really comes down to planting date
[26:19.480 --> 26:23.660]  because of the photoperiodic nature of them. Initially, we're telling people
[26:23.660 --> 26:28.220]  go in June 15th. That's when you wanna be. You wanna be in
[26:28.220 --> 26:31.860]  before solstice. Get these babies in the ground June 15th. And then we're
[26:31.860 --> 26:37.440]  finding even that five foot row spacing and four foot plant spacing that
[26:37.440 --> 26:41.340]  we're just overgrowing the field. So we've gotten to a point where we're
[26:41.340 --> 26:45.440]  telling people like you're gonna plant like July 5th and you're gonna fill
[26:45.440 --> 26:48.680]  this field and on July 5th you're planting, you're gonna end up by
[26:48.680 --> 26:51.400]  the time you harvest with four and a half to five and a
[26:51.400 --> 26:54.840]  half foot tall plants. So that's kind of the size that we're pushing.
[26:55.160 --> 26:59.360]  But I can show you some beautiful fields where I'm standing and the plants
[26:59.360 --> 27:03.880]  are well over my head. I've got one from Oregon that was 112
[27:03.880 --> 27:07.240]  acres of plants that averaged like seven and a half, eight feet tall
[27:07.940 --> 27:11.260]  a couple of years ago. So again, it's just planting time. And then
[27:11.740 --> 27:15.940]  also comes down to what's the right... What's the most manageable size of
[27:15.940 --> 27:19.340]  plant to harvest? You and I, we've all learned this stuff.
[27:20.140 --> 27:23.180]  When we put it up at scale, most of these guys have...
[27:23.240 --> 27:25.860]  They just have no idea of the things that we see like
[27:26.380 --> 27:30.700]  hard weight versus soft weight. What's all this airy stuff in the middle?
[27:31.620 --> 27:34.260]  What's the right amount of hard weight to get a yield?
[27:34.760 --> 27:39.360]  So again, just planting date and size has a lot to do with
[27:39.360 --> 27:41.760]  that. And what we learned is about a four and a half to
[27:41.760 --> 27:45.840]  five and a half foot tall plant is the best plant for harvest,
[27:45.840 --> 27:48.920]  is the best plant for flower yield, doesn't have much
[27:50.560 --> 27:53.320]  blockage, so you get good light strike all the way down to the
[27:53.320 --> 27:56.840]  center. But yeah, we're talking about a field full of plants that are
[27:56.840 --> 27:59.200]  as tall as you and I for the most part are pretty close.
[27:59.840 --> 28:03.800]  That sounds like a very fun place to check out what you've bred
[28:03.820 --> 28:07.420]  for the year. It is, it actually really is.
[28:08.660 --> 28:11.940]  I'd go back to the breeding project, it's almost unfair.
[28:12.800 --> 28:14.900]  The first year we did this because we had
[28:15.640 --> 28:19.700]  the opportunity... We introduced American feral lineage into
[28:20.500 --> 28:23.900]  the genetics that we have, so we had all this pre 1937
[28:24.340 --> 28:27.560]  work that we had selected, but it was wild and crazy and
[28:27.560 --> 28:31.940]  all across the board. These are just ridiculously broad and diverse genetics.
[28:32.400 --> 28:35.400]  But when you take them and you put them out across a population
[28:35.400 --> 28:39.560]  of five acres and 10,000 plants, all of a sudden everything starts to
[28:39.560 --> 28:44.000]  make sense. It's really unfair though, because how many of us have been
[28:44.000 --> 28:48.080]  breeding with 100 plant examples and 50 plant examples, right?
[28:49.240 --> 28:51.800]  So it was like taking candy from a baby in some ways
[28:52.880 --> 28:55.920]  because I knew what I was doing with breeding already, but yes,
[28:55.920 --> 29:00.160]  the scale is ridiculous. So I guess let's back up and go...
[29:00.160 --> 29:02.420]  I'd like to go into what you just kind of touched on,
[29:02.420 --> 29:06.100]  which I think is the part that people would find the most interesting
[29:06.100 --> 29:12.020]  is how you went about selecting and breeding the cultivars that you guys
[29:12.020 --> 29:14.900]  are now selling. I find that to be a really interesting story. Of course,
[29:14.900 --> 29:19.920]  of course. And it is interesting to me and I want people to
[29:19.920 --> 29:24.660]  know that the people who did well in the CBD game are people
[29:24.660 --> 29:27.740]  who generally came from cannabis. If you didn't know
[29:28.400 --> 29:31.860]  all about what we all love and are passionate about, you weren't getting
[29:31.860 --> 29:36.240]  anywhere towards a type three plant. But essentially, here we are,
[29:38.400 --> 29:42.040]  we see the legislation passed, we know we have the opportunity to produce
[29:42.040 --> 29:45.000]  this. And as I stated, the first year that we did it,
[29:45.360 --> 29:49.580]  we had just... We struggled to find genetics. We had the CBD crew.
[29:49.580 --> 29:53.440]  Fortunately, I had lived in Switzerland in the 90s. I had an understanding
[29:53.440 --> 29:57.220]  of what was going on there. And so I was able to reach out
[29:57.240 --> 29:59.800]  and tap some resources with the CBD crew and get
[30:00.600 --> 30:03.360]  genetics for us at that time. But it opened my eyes to this
[30:04.000 --> 30:09.000]  void of genetics. Well, me being a passionate heirloom and land raise
[30:09.000 --> 30:14.680]  collector, it wasn't lost on me that there's value in the heirlooms that
[30:14.680 --> 30:17.840]  we have here in the States. I think most people are like,
[30:17.960 --> 30:21.600]  I want Malawi, I want the Vietnamese black,
[30:22.500 --> 30:26.740]  I want Acapulco gold, which I'm super passionate about. I love all of
[30:26.760 --> 30:30.680]  that stuff. But I also collected a bunch of
[30:31.680 --> 30:35.440]  native plants here. And honestly, I shouldn't even say that I'm responsible
[30:35.440 --> 30:39.640]  for collecting all of them. I got a lot of them from a
[30:39.640 --> 30:43.380]  gentleman named Ben Holmes. And Ben Holmes did some early work.
[30:43.380 --> 30:46.740]  He created... In type three plants, he created a plant that a lot
[30:46.740 --> 30:50.200]  of people have read off of. And I'd say the germplasm for that
[30:50.200 --> 30:53.120]  plant exists in most of the type three plants that we have.
[30:53.140 --> 30:58.740]  And that's something called the OTT02. Well, he did another project where
[30:58.740 --> 31:01.140]  he collected a bunch of seed from
[31:03.140 --> 31:06.700]  some different areas around the Midwest. So some of that original seed
[31:06.700 --> 31:10.120]  we had came from that. Some of it we had collected and procured
[31:10.120 --> 31:13.780]  from different areas. But essentially, the idea being, look, we're gonna
[31:13.780 --> 31:19.300]  do a targeted collection of all of these ferals that have... Or all
[31:19.300 --> 31:22.820]  of these populations of heirlooms that have gone feral and are now existing
[31:22.840 --> 31:27.840]  on the edge of the fields. I, again, saw that hemp was coming
[31:27.840 --> 31:32.040]  online soon, that we were likely to be producing CBD at scale.
[31:32.120 --> 31:36.000]  If not CBD, we were gonna be producing industrial hemp. And what I
[31:36.000 --> 31:39.620]  understood was that as soon as we brought in all this new generation
[31:39.620 --> 31:44.400]  of hemp, it would influence everything that we had, either epigenetically or
[31:44.400 --> 31:49.120]  with direct pollen, and we would never have the same picture of what
[31:49.120 --> 31:52.240]  was brought here by our founding fathers from India and China.
[31:53.140 --> 31:57.300]  And what was developed here in North America. So we had the foresight
[31:57.300 --> 32:00.260]  or I had the foresight to preserve a lot of that seed,
[32:01.100 --> 32:06.120]  and specifically target seed that we knew was pre 1937, and in any
[32:06.120 --> 32:10.340]  way possible, go to the second or third generation, the older generation
[32:10.340 --> 32:13.300]  of the family and say, which one looks like the one
[32:13.900 --> 32:17.900]  that you grew, that your granddad grew when you were a kid,
[32:17.900 --> 32:22.020]  or your dad grew when you were a kid? And parallel that by
[32:22.040 --> 32:26.360]  trying to find fields that were isolated and fields that were likely used
[32:26.360 --> 32:30.080]  for production or we knew historically were used for production during the
[32:30.080 --> 32:34.160]  hemp for victory efforts in World War II and in Korea.
[32:34.480 --> 32:37.080]  Now, we collected a bunch of those seeds. I took
[32:38.200 --> 32:42.120]  423 of those seeds, and you can read this on our website,
[32:42.120 --> 32:45.960]  but I took... I had 423 of those seeds in a collected population.
[32:45.960 --> 32:48.600]  This is how all of us breeders are, right? We literally know,
[32:48.600 --> 32:51.400]  if you know, you know. You know exactly what you did,
[32:51.700 --> 32:55.620]  the seed population you worked with and everything. So we had 423 seeds
[32:55.620 --> 33:01.220]  that we started with, germinated all of those out of that population,
[33:01.220 --> 33:04.460]  and this is all indoors. Out of that population,
[33:06.560 --> 33:11.060]  we found through leaf presence testing. So this is early on,
[33:11.060 --> 33:14.820]  we're having analytics finally come online. Most of the analytics are at
[33:14.820 --> 33:17.980]  the end of the cycle, so we're testing for our cannabinoids and terpenes.
[33:18.000 --> 33:22.360]  Well, we found a group that would do cannabinoid presence testing
[33:23.360 --> 33:26.880]  on early leaf samples. And what that... It didn't give us an idea
[33:26.880 --> 33:30.400]  of what the content would be, but it gave us a ratio idea.
[33:30.920 --> 33:35.880]  So based on growth traits, so stuff that rooted well, germinated well,
[33:36.320 --> 33:38.960]  showed vigor because we knew we were going outside,
[33:40.720 --> 33:45.720]  and then checked all the boxes for ratio. Yeah, for CBD to THC ratio,
[33:46.020 --> 33:49.260]  we bred those... We pushed those forward into the population. And there
[33:49.260 --> 33:51.380]  ended up being, I believe, 96
[33:52.540 --> 33:55.580]  females that we ran the first year across five acres,
[33:56.020 --> 34:00.820]  and from those... As well as five males. So I had five males
[34:00.820 --> 34:04.660]  that I selected that we kept back. Those 96 females, we ran them
[34:04.660 --> 34:09.500]  across the whole season, and it took 10,000 examples of those 96.
[34:09.500 --> 34:12.480]  So we did mother and clone those, so we could really get a
[34:12.500 --> 34:15.860]  good picture of what they looked like in field, and how they correlated
[34:15.860 --> 34:21.300]  and what they really were like. Out of those 96, we identified just
[34:21.300 --> 34:27.660]  22 that made sense to breed forward. We then took those 22 at
[34:27.660 --> 34:31.740]  the end of the season and did an open pollination with those 22
[34:31.740 --> 34:36.540]  in the five males. So that was my seed preservation work
[34:37.180 --> 34:41.940]  for those American pharaohs. From that, we ended up with 80 to 120,000
[34:41.960 --> 34:45.400]  seeds. It was a 3000 square foot room that we did,
[34:45.840 --> 34:51.840]  and that's what we started. 50%, just half of this breeding program.
[34:52.360 --> 34:55.080]  And the reason that I did that, Jamal, is that we were looking
[34:55.080 --> 35:00.680]  for stuff that was field hardy, that was pest resistant, frost resistant,
[35:00.680 --> 35:04.920]  mold resistant, because another thing that we understand is we babied the
[35:04.920 --> 35:08.700]  heck out of this plant. We have taken it and coddled it,
[35:08.720 --> 35:12.060]  and all my 20 to ones and 10 to ones, man,
[35:12.060 --> 35:16.040]  these are all indoor plants. These are all resin producers. They might
[35:16.040 --> 35:20.560]  do well outside babied, but what happens when you put them in a
[35:20.560 --> 35:24.620]  field under irrigation, you can't touch them, you can't top them,
[35:24.620 --> 35:27.680]  you can't do anything. So to me, that was
[35:28.860 --> 35:32.040]  the half of the breeding element for this type three program
[35:33.200 --> 35:37.680]  to gain some of that element, some of that field hardiness. Well,
[35:37.700 --> 35:43.100]  we took those progeny, that seed progeny, and we started a breeding program
[35:43.260 --> 35:47.860]  that was bringing in our 20 to ones. So I had a couple
[35:47.860 --> 35:52.500]  of 20 to ones that we... And 15 to ones, 16 to ones
[35:52.500 --> 35:55.860]  that we started. We mostly ended up with
[35:56.840 --> 36:00.860]  what's called the forical. So there's an old line that came from Southern
[36:00.860 --> 36:05.000]  California that was an elite clone only, and you guys can find it
[36:05.020 --> 36:07.780]  online. And if you can get... If anybody can get it,
[36:08.220 --> 36:11.700]  get it, because if you are looking for a CBD 20 to one,
[36:12.020 --> 36:17.500]  this is a very efficacious, very high quality, easy to produce, terpene rich
[36:17.820 --> 36:23.900]  20 to one. I think maybe cell versions of that clone only became
[36:23.900 --> 36:29.820]  ACDC down the line, but ACDC is very diluted. It's not terpene rich,
[36:29.820 --> 36:32.420]  it can... You can struggle to grow it, and it's a 20 to one
[36:32.420 --> 36:34.700]  that's pretty common with people we referenced earlier.
[36:35.020 --> 36:39.260]  But we took that oracle primarily and bred that in with these ferals,
[36:39.500 --> 36:45.560]  and between... Ended up with between 12.5% and 50% of that feral lineage,
[36:45.560 --> 36:49.660]  depending on which of the catalog you choose, and created that commercial
[36:49.660 --> 36:54.180]  catalog of 12 varieties off of those lineages.
[36:55.620 --> 36:58.340]  That's so awesome. So essentially, this whole...
[36:59.420 --> 37:02.540]  This hunt was to look for your male, is that correct?
[37:02.600 --> 37:05.880]  Yeah. Well, the hunt was to look for the female progeny,
[37:05.880 --> 37:08.940]  and remember, a lot of this is selfing. I do wanna touch on
[37:08.940 --> 37:11.800]  that though. All of our work is out crossed, not in crossed.
[37:11.800 --> 37:16.280]  So male, female, we're in a real odd world where it doesn't...
[37:16.760 --> 37:22.640]  It doesn't mix. But... So it's a donor plant. Yes, yes, exactly.
[37:22.640 --> 37:24.760]  Looking for the best donor plants. But I will say
[37:25.480 --> 37:31.720]  that being a natural plant breeder, and understanding plant plasticity,
[37:31.740 --> 37:35.540]  and loving and respecting the plant, the first breeding that we did was
[37:35.540 --> 37:40.900]  that true male, five true males against 22 true females to get that
[37:40.900 --> 37:46.260]  population moving. So yeah, but from there on, there's a lot of reversals
[37:46.560 --> 37:50.140]  to select males. You're looking to select males that also...
[37:50.940 --> 37:54.880]  That reverse well, you know? Anything that you're gonna do from female
[37:54.880 --> 37:58.700]  progeny for feminized seed. Because when you go into feminized seed,
[37:59.000 --> 38:01.880]  to create XX pollen, a reversal is a critical element of it.
[38:01.880 --> 38:07.140]  You have to have reversals. And going in that area, have you noticed
[38:07.140 --> 38:11.440]  things such as... I've noticed with some things, if you go to an
[38:11.440 --> 38:15.680]  S2, that you get sterile pollen. Was that something that you came across
[38:15.680 --> 38:19.320]  where mutants, things that did not like, they had breeding? You know,
[38:19.320 --> 38:22.320]  and it's funny that you say that, because that was the next evolution
[38:22.320 --> 38:25.480]  of work from people that were on my side of the space,
[38:25.500 --> 38:30.840]  was to try and sterilize genetics. And I frown on it.
[38:31.220 --> 38:34.620]  I wouldn't even wanna lean in that direction. Yes, we find the same
[38:34.620 --> 38:38.760]  thing. Absolutely, Jamal. We're finding similar things, but I don't even
[38:38.760 --> 38:42.440]  wanna lean that direction. I absolutely want everything that we have to
[38:42.440 --> 38:47.000]  be as true to the plant and as breedable as it can be,
[38:47.000 --> 38:52.420]  which goes to even a whole other, I guess, foundational element of my
[38:52.440 --> 38:57.320]  thinking, when we talk about poly polys, like this new poly hybridism
[38:57.320 --> 39:00.580]  that we're doing. I think we're breeding ourselves into a corner with
[39:00.580 --> 39:03.520]  cannabis in a lot of ways, and it's really important to pull back
[39:03.520 --> 39:09.160]  from that, so that 50 more years of breeding work can happen without
[39:09.160 --> 39:15.600]  us creating something that's, I guess, sick and weak and not strong and
[39:15.600 --> 39:18.880]  prone to disease, right? Along with a lot of other things that come
[39:18.880 --> 39:21.960]  from going that far in one direction. No, for sure. I mean,
[39:21.980 --> 39:26.100]  I would say this, you're definitely preaching to the choir, definitely
[39:26.100 --> 39:31.660]  in terms of that. We really encourage people to step out of the box
[39:31.660 --> 39:36.340]  to grow different things, to go back to land race heirloom varieties,
[39:37.180 --> 39:40.060]  and just kind of see what they're about. That's what our show is about,
[39:40.060 --> 39:44.400]  and that's kind of like a lot of the future cannabis project energy is
[39:44.400 --> 39:51.580]  really into cannabis exploration, going back to the root of things.
[39:51.800 --> 39:56.880]  For me personally, when I grow a lot of certain types of land race,
[39:56.880 --> 40:00.080]  I get a different type of enjoyment out of the plant. I mean,
[40:00.120 --> 40:04.560]  honestly, do I smoke a lot of the Panama Red stuff that comes
[40:04.560 --> 40:08.840]  out of my backyard? No, it's not. I live in Northern California,
[40:08.840 --> 40:14.080]  it just doesn't flower enough, but the understanding of the plant that you
[40:14.080 --> 40:19.960]  get just exceeds growing a monocrop. And I mean, it's super obvious
[40:20.340 --> 40:23.940]  when you start talking about stuff and just like, oh, interesting,
[40:23.940 --> 40:30.260]  like you're on it. It's like talking about the plant, learning really about
[40:30.260 --> 40:34.340]  the plant, less just like growing a bud that you already know everything
[40:34.340 --> 40:36.740]  that's gonna come out of it. It's kind of like you put it
[40:36.740 --> 40:38.660]  in, you do this, this, and this, and then you get this
[40:38.660 --> 40:42.340]  product. The plant is so ready to work with us.
[40:43.660 --> 40:46.740]  You just ask for it and it's there. After 30 years of doing
[40:47.320 --> 40:51.080]  it, I can stand behind that, that there's an element of intention.
[40:52.320 --> 40:56.360]  And going back to land race breeding or heirloom breeding, I mean,
[40:56.360 --> 41:00.480]  that's something else that we touch on is land race. To me,
[41:00.800 --> 41:04.640]  there may be some land races out there, but land race implies that
[41:04.640 --> 41:09.080]  we never touched it. And either through selection or deselection,
[41:09.840 --> 41:12.820]  most of the time we touch this plant if we encounter it because
[41:12.820 --> 41:15.880]  we're so fascinated by it as humans. And I think that goes back
[41:16.020 --> 41:21.340]  a long way. Most of it, I think, is heirloom that's out there,
[41:21.340 --> 41:24.620]  even if it's ancient heirloom that hasn't had human influence for
[41:25.300 --> 41:29.260]  a thousand years, or it's heirloom because of deselection, like literally
[41:29.260 --> 41:31.780]  it just got thrown out and ended up somewhere.
[41:34.100 --> 41:37.620]  There's nothing more fascinating than heirloom and land race genetics.
[41:37.940 --> 41:43.300]  They hold the plasticity. They hold the ability to modify and change
[41:43.360 --> 41:48.040]  shape quickly. And also for me, when you see them and you
[41:48.040 --> 41:52.080]  see the things that they're able to do, it takes you out of
[41:52.080 --> 41:58.880]  your box of an indoor clone. When I first started growing cannabis,
[41:59.520 --> 42:05.320]  I probably grew for five years clone only before I ever grew a
[42:05.320 --> 42:10.600]  seed. We had a cutting and you would run it. That's just what
[42:10.620 --> 42:13.100]  you did. You ran it and then you had something else and you
[42:13.100 --> 42:17.740]  just ran that. And it wasn't like you grew seeds and like vino
[42:17.740 --> 42:22.940]  hunted. That just wasn't really what many, many, many people did.
[42:24.820 --> 42:25.980]  I mean, you know what I mean, right?
[42:26.940 --> 42:29.980]  I think I grew clone only for the first five or six years
[42:29.980 --> 42:32.660]  that I grew. And yeah, we were all able to get good elites
[42:32.660 --> 42:36.180]  here in the West Coast, so why do all the hunt early on?
[42:36.180 --> 42:39.180]  It's only, I think, the passion that finally leads you to say,
[42:39.180 --> 42:42.320]  wait, I can maybe find some more here.
[42:42.840 --> 42:48.800]  I mean, for us, it was like the medical money was too good. It
[42:48.800 --> 42:51.800]  was like you knew if you grew something, you could take it to
[42:51.800 --> 42:56.880]  the dispensary and you were taken care of. And to vino hunt
[42:56.880 --> 43:00.660]  and to look through things and to explore was just not in the
[43:00.660 --> 43:07.080]  cards at that time period. That's one of the few blessings
[43:07.100 --> 43:10.380]  of such a low price of cannabis now is that you really can
[43:10.380 --> 43:15.180]  basically grow whatever you want and really grow it for the love
[43:15.180 --> 43:15.500]  of it.
[43:15.860 --> 43:16.300]  Yeah.
[43:17.140 --> 43:20.340]  And I mean, to me, I just find it so interesting because when I
[43:20.340 --> 43:25.940]  geek out and I'd be like, if I could do any project perfectly,
[43:26.100 --> 43:29.380]  it sounds very similar to what you had explained that you did.
[43:30.220 --> 43:35.180]  Are you like a specific time period, a specific place, and
[43:35.200 --> 43:40.240]  then hunted through those to then add to your hair, your
[43:40.240 --> 43:43.920]  females that you were selected for? I find that so cool.
[43:44.720 --> 43:47.600]  Living the dream. You're right. That's how I felt about it. It's
[43:47.600 --> 43:50.280]  like, oh, I've been doing this forever. This is all I really
[43:50.280 --> 43:54.000]  know well. And now I get to do it at this kind of scale. No,
[43:54.000 --> 43:58.760]  it definitely, it was exciting to and it led me happily into
[43:58.760 --> 44:01.840]  type three plants. And I'm happy. And the other thing about
[44:01.840 --> 44:03.620]  that is we've had the opportunity or I've had the
[44:03.620 --> 44:08.880]  opportunity to work with USDA and USDA Fisk Phytosanitary and
[44:09.320 --> 44:13.160]  the university seed labs and really understand what it's
[44:13.160 --> 44:17.480]  going to take for all of us to one, hold our seed that we
[44:17.480 --> 44:21.160]  create in the cannabis space, and to make sure that it can
[44:21.160 --> 44:26.040]  legally move through channels that it needs to, and safely
[44:26.040 --> 44:29.360]  that we're not spreading HPLV and tobacco mosaic virus and
[44:29.360 --> 44:32.300]  these kinds of things. So I wouldn't have learned that
[44:32.360 --> 44:35.240]  start, you know, if I had started stayed in type one and
[44:35.240 --> 44:40.080]  type two seed. So because of the international compliance nature,
[44:40.080 --> 44:43.360]  it just opened the door. And now I'm, I would say that I'm ready
[44:43.360 --> 44:46.200]  to help every single breeder that I know that is in this
[44:46.200 --> 44:51.620]  space, as these doors open to one, make sure that they can own
[44:51.640 --> 44:55.520]  and hold the value of their genetics, right? Because the
[44:55.520 --> 45:01.040]  honor that we maintained for so long is just not, it's not there
[45:01.060 --> 45:03.980]  in the eyes of some of these large MSOs. They don't have a
[45:03.980 --> 45:09.360]  problem taking a man's genetics and his work, and because they paid a
[45:09.360 --> 45:14.100]  dollar for it, changing the names on it and not... Whereas we cherished
[45:14.100 --> 45:19.540]  historically the opportunity to take a guy's name and do the hunt and
[45:19.620 --> 45:22.300]  put that cut out and say, this is this, you know what I
[45:22.300 --> 45:26.300]  mean? So that we all naturally built on each other. And that's one
[45:26.300 --> 45:28.980]  of the things that I'm concerned will fall by the wayside.
[45:29.000 --> 45:31.280]  So I would say that I'm happy to have taken the last
[45:31.280 --> 45:36.480]  eight years, danced this dance through policy and regulatory crap stuff
[45:36.480 --> 45:39.080]  that is not fascinating to me in any way,
[45:39.720 --> 45:43.640]  so that as all of us have the opportunity with the ITHC plans,
[45:43.640 --> 45:47.260]  type ones and type twos to do this, that, yeah, the work
[45:47.260 --> 45:51.840]  just doesn't get pilfered, that people toe the line.
[45:54.080 --> 45:58.360]  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's a sticky subject for sure.
[45:59.480 --> 46:06.680]  Yeah. I mean, yeah. Intellectual property rights is a sticky subject.
[46:06.840 --> 46:09.520]  Well, I'd say it this way. I'd say, all of us,
[46:10.680 --> 46:15.880]  the morality of patenting life shouldn't be the debate.
[46:17.240 --> 46:20.960]  The morality of whether or not... Of patenting a plant,
[46:21.800 --> 46:25.200]  it shouldn't be the dialogue that we're having at this point.
[46:25.360 --> 46:28.120]  The dialogue that whether or not that's right or wrong,
[46:28.940 --> 46:33.140]  that already was decided, and I'm not gonna stand here and tell you
[46:33.140 --> 46:35.420]  what's right or wrong. I think you know the core of me in
[46:35.420 --> 46:38.820]  my heart, what I believe when I talk about that. But the fact
[46:38.820 --> 46:41.980]  of the matter is, is we have four major agribusiness companies
[46:43.100 --> 46:46.440]  in the globe right now, and these guys have figured out how to
[46:46.440 --> 46:51.360]  patent plant life and create IP out of plant life. And so it's
[46:51.360 --> 46:55.380]  put all of us in the position where we have to recognize this
[46:55.400 --> 46:59.020]  is a multi trillion dollar industry globally, and
[47:00.320 --> 47:03.960]  it's very unique in that most of this beautiful work that's been done
[47:03.960 --> 47:08.920]  is all open source. And there are people that are nefarious out there
[47:08.920 --> 47:11.840]  that are gonna snatch it up. And then not only will they not
[47:11.840 --> 47:15.640]  allow the people that created the work to profit from it and for
[47:15.640 --> 47:18.920]  their families to be okay, but they'll stop
[47:20.000 --> 47:23.340]  anyone who's been working with that from working with it. They'll take the
[47:23.360 --> 47:27.240]  exclusive rights. So I would just ask that when we talk about IP,
[47:27.520 --> 47:31.320]  that we get beyond the conversation of whether or not IP protection is
[47:31.320 --> 47:36.480]  right or wrong, and get to the conversation of, hey, do we wanna
[47:37.320 --> 47:40.400]  be able to protect the work that we've created? Do we wanna be
[47:40.400 --> 47:43.640]  able to see our kids fed from that? If we do,
[47:43.640 --> 47:46.560]  we kinda have to look at
[47:48.720 --> 47:52.440]  how that looks. And I see someone, Keeper of the Strange, genetics belong
[47:52.540 --> 47:56.780]  to the people 100%. Genetics belong to the people 100%. I think
[47:57.340 --> 48:01.660]  when another part of that, when we talk about IP, is IP actually
[48:01.660 --> 48:06.540]  gives the breeder and the holder of that genetic the right to open
[48:06.540 --> 48:10.980]  it up to the people freely. So I think that's really important to talk
[48:10.980 --> 48:15.580]  about IP from that perspective, that it gives people the right to
[48:17.140 --> 48:22.420]  open the door and give anything to anybody without risk of actually losing
[48:23.420 --> 48:31.040]  the possibility of seeing something come from it. And again, it's a sensitive
[48:31.040 --> 48:34.560]  thing. It's only one aspect of what I was talking about.
[48:35.080 --> 48:38.280]  The other aspects are the fact that we've learned legal seed labeling,
[48:38.720 --> 48:42.760]  we've learned how to deal with the Animal Plant Health Inspection Safety
[48:43.400 --> 48:47.440]  groups from USDA so that we can get legal phytosanitarians. We've learned
[48:47.440 --> 48:50.920]  how to get the pest and disease reports that we need to ship
[48:50.940 --> 48:54.940]  seed to places like Australia and Europe and other countries legally.
[48:54.940 --> 48:57.660]  So as much as the IP was a part of that,
[48:58.100 --> 49:00.780]  I also wanna offer to everybody in this industry
[49:01.640 --> 49:05.140]  those stepping stones to actually being able to move their seed wherever they
[49:05.140 --> 49:09.260]  want and really create a company out of it, the genetic work that
[49:09.260 --> 49:17.540]  they've done. That's awesome. Yeah. It's a whole new... It's a new
[49:18.480 --> 49:22.560]  industry and we're also dealing with old issues.
[49:24.160 --> 49:26.640]  It's like new stuff and old bullshit.
[49:32.120 --> 49:36.280]  I wanted to go back to a few questions regarding, I guess,
[49:36.320 --> 49:43.320]  plant morphology, if that's okay? Absolutely. So the plants that you're...
[49:44.320 --> 49:47.060]  Now I'm all high, so it looks like... Alright, so the plants...
[49:47.060 --> 49:50.460]  No, it's good. You got me reading the comments, because we got some
[49:50.460 --> 49:53.660]  people engaged here that are paying attention to what we're talking about
[49:53.660 --> 49:56.020]  and I love it. So yeah, we're both in the same space.
[49:56.020 --> 49:58.500]  We can pick up and move forward on morphology.
[50:01.420 --> 50:07.260]  So inherently, these plants are grown in rows,
[50:08.260 --> 50:13.960]  and you said there is very little top... There's no topping or pruning.
[50:16.160 --> 50:20.160]  So I would assume there's also... There are other traits that you would
[50:20.160 --> 50:24.320]  be selecting for. Yeah, I'd like to... Yeah, go ahead, sorry. And I
[50:24.320 --> 50:28.000]  was gonna say, one of the ones that I'm really keen on selecting
[50:28.000 --> 50:34.200]  for is leaf structure. So if it's a wide leaf or a narrow leaf
[50:34.220 --> 50:37.780]  and also stem length, because
[50:39.540 --> 50:43.140]  what I've noticed is a lot of the plants that I usually love,
[50:44.300 --> 50:49.020]  the fan leaf ends up landing directly on top of the bud below
[50:49.020 --> 50:54.260]  it. And sometimes there are leaves, like for example, sour diesel, that
[50:54.260 --> 50:58.580]  are nice and thin, so it goes through. And sometimes there's a nice
[50:58.800 --> 51:04.400]  long stalk or stem so that the bud is able to do that.
[51:05.780 --> 51:08.640]  And for me, I'm thinking, okay, what does this plant look like?
[51:08.640 --> 51:11.400]  And for what you're describing, it looks just like any other plant.
[51:12.800 --> 51:16.600]  It does, and going down to what you're saying, I think plant morphology,
[51:16.600 --> 51:20.120]  this selection is a lot driven by the same. Here we're looking in
[51:20.120 --> 51:23.720]  the field, what's gonna not cause problems, what's gonna cause problems
[51:23.740 --> 51:25.940]  with petiole length and leaf
[51:27.260 --> 51:29.460]  width and so on and so forth.
[51:30.540 --> 51:32.980]  One of the things that I was gonna... I started to say was
[51:32.980 --> 51:40.420]  that picking plants that naturally broke apical dominance, recognizing that
[51:40.740 --> 51:44.300]  we've been out here topping plants to get yield potential up high,
[51:45.140 --> 51:48.060]  how do we get good branching? You don't want one plant that's just
[51:48.060 --> 51:52.380]  growing up like a little tree, even if it's got room around it.
[51:52.960 --> 51:57.080]  We really selected a lot for breaking apical dominance.
[51:57.800 --> 52:01.240]  You mentioned sour diesel. Sour diesel, one of my favorite plants to grow
[52:01.240 --> 52:06.300]  in the world, taught me similarly that I like plants with a little
[52:06.300 --> 52:10.600]  longer internodal spacing, a little narrower leaf. And when you're sitting
[52:10.600 --> 52:13.920]  here growing... I was growing a couple of hundred square feet
[52:14.600 --> 52:17.460]  through the medical days, and as you're turning that cycle every single
[52:17.460 --> 52:20.640]  time with different genetics, you get a pretty good sense of what your
[52:20.660 --> 52:24.820]  yield potential is, and you start to realize that if you have the
[52:24.820 --> 52:29.020]  ceiling height, that a plant like sour diesel with a little bit longer
[52:29.020 --> 52:32.280]  internodal spacing is gonna give you the same yield as a shorter plant
[52:32.280 --> 52:35.200]  that looks all stocky and chunky. So once you figure that out,
[52:36.400 --> 52:39.920]  it's a game changer. And I guess for me, I definitely was looking
[52:39.920 --> 52:43.760]  at plants that did exactly that. Narrower leaf patterns,
[52:45.520 --> 52:49.400]  longer internodal spacing, and then, like I say, primarily breaking apical
[52:49.400 --> 52:53.480]  dominance. And then another big one is where the branches are connecting
[52:53.520 --> 52:57.460]  to the main stem, that they don't wanna split and drop when they
[52:57.460 --> 53:01.640]  get weight, because we couldn't have plants that needed to be supported.
[53:01.640 --> 53:05.080]  We just couldn't have anything that... Everything had to be self supporting.
[53:05.420 --> 53:08.180]  Only because you take 10,000 plants and it becomes...
[53:09.500 --> 53:13.060]  It's just the logistics of it are impossible for you to go out
[53:13.060 --> 53:15.420]  and do all that work on individual plants.
[53:16.320 --> 53:19.140]  Oh my God, that sounds like a nightmare. I mean, I can imagine
[53:19.160 --> 53:21.760]  towards the end if a wind storm comes or something.
[53:24.000 --> 53:27.200]  Well, and we've seen that. That's the beautiful thing. At this point now,
[53:27.200 --> 53:29.760]  the plants have been in field in so many places for so long
[53:29.760 --> 53:33.620]  that we get these great stories. Like, my plants were covered with snow
[53:33.620 --> 53:37.720]  for two days and it was 24 degrees and everything melted and they were
[53:37.720 --> 53:41.340]  fine. Or we had 60 mile an hour winds come through and everything
[53:41.340 --> 53:44.900]  blew over. And next thing you know, they're picking back up and leaning
[53:44.920 --> 53:49.040]  into it after a couple of days. So we definitely get to see
[53:49.040 --> 53:54.080]  all that exposure that us as cannabis farmers really never got to see.
[53:54.620 --> 54:00.600]  Interesting. And I mean, you're essentially... You're selecting for seed
[54:01.560 --> 54:07.080]  plants, not clones. Correct. And that's... It was debatable in the beginning.
[54:07.080 --> 54:11.520]  Like the first year we did 40,000, 50,000 clones and gave those out
[54:11.540 --> 54:13.700]  to farms when genetics were tough to come by.
[54:14.380 --> 54:17.140]  So nobody really knew if it was gonna be rootstock or seed.
[54:17.880 --> 54:22.060]  Seed cost was high, so that drove people into rootstock. But the reality
[54:22.060 --> 54:26.860]  is what we're learning is that seed production cost for feminized hemp seed
[54:26.860 --> 54:31.780]  is not high. It can be... And probably only say this on Future
[54:31.900 --> 54:34.340]  Cannabis Project, if somebody will pick it up and clean it and love
[54:34.340 --> 54:36.860]  it. But you're talking, if you're good at production,
[54:37.520 --> 54:41.680]  less than a nickel a seed. So you can get the... You can
[54:41.680 --> 54:45.240]  still have a profitable company and bring the seed cost down reasonably low.
[54:45.920 --> 54:49.080]  Looking at outside of industries that still exist on seed, we have like
[54:49.080 --> 54:52.680]  watermelon industry, seedless watermelon industry is still at 30 cents,
[54:52.680 --> 54:56.600]  32 cents a seed. So when you talk about seed value,
[54:56.600 --> 55:00.440]  there's still good margins there. So I think now we're pretty much establishing
[55:00.440 --> 55:03.200]  that it's not gonna be a rootstock based industry, that it's gonna be
[55:03.260 --> 55:07.620]  a seed based industry. Again, it was debatable when companies like ours
[55:07.620 --> 55:13.040]  were getting $1 and $1.25 a seed, right? But now the price has
[55:13.040 --> 55:17.540]  stabilized a little bit, and so it's clearly shaping into a seed industry.
[55:17.540 --> 55:21.140]  Plus, cannabis and hemp, they grow really well from seed.
[55:22.140 --> 55:24.540]  If you can direct so, you get a seed vigor,
[55:25.220 --> 55:29.620]  you get a tap root. So yeah, we're definitely producing and leaning all
[55:29.640 --> 55:33.600]  towards seed now. And okay, so this is starting to make sense.
[55:33.600 --> 55:40.320]  So people are... So when you're advising farmers on how to plant,
[55:40.600 --> 55:44.080]  I'm assuming you're telling them when you have a plant date of somewhere
[55:44.080 --> 55:47.560]  in July, is that when they're planting their seeds or seedlings?
[55:47.960 --> 55:52.560]  So that would be in ground for transplants, actually, and I'm really glad
[55:52.560 --> 55:56.280]  that you brought that up. I'm really glad. So we'll direct so at
[55:56.300 --> 55:59.580]  the end of June. Direct so right at the end of June.
[55:59.580 --> 56:03.100]  Give them four to five days advance for emergence. What's crazy is that...
[56:03.600 --> 56:08.940]  And that's worth noting. I'm telling these farmers, give four to five days
[56:08.940 --> 56:13.780]  advance over transplant to seedling, and you'll end up with the same size
[56:13.780 --> 56:18.320]  plant. That seedling is 21, 17 to 21 days old when it goes
[56:18.320 --> 56:22.140]  to the ground. So that will show you that there's the difference in
[56:22.320 --> 56:27.340]  a seed direct so versus a transplant. They will end up the same
[56:27.340 --> 56:30.840]  size if you plant a 40... If that makes sense, I don't know how
[56:30.840 --> 56:34.140]  to say exactly, but a four day old seed is equivalent to a
[56:34.140 --> 56:37.940]  21 day old clone in ground as far as ending up with the
[56:37.940 --> 56:42.820]  same size plant. Interesting. Okay. Yeah, yeah. Because you lose three days
[56:42.820 --> 56:46.300]  of shock to transplant generally, even if you're very good and very gentle
[56:46.300 --> 56:50.380]  with the plants. There's no growth there, and you just can't compete with
[56:50.420 --> 56:55.280]  seed bigger. So yeah, we're saying go in June 30, June 28 with
[56:55.280 --> 57:00.740]  a seed direct so, go in July 4 to 6 with a transplant.
[57:03.650 --> 57:07.070]  July 4 to 6 with a transplant, and they basically veg July,
[57:07.770 --> 57:13.050]  start flowering August, and then finished by the end of September.
[57:13.570 --> 57:16.070]  And a little further for us. We had plants that...
[57:16.690 --> 57:20.510]  Another thing I've learned is that growing outdoors, plants that are a
[57:20.550 --> 57:24.230]  little later to set flower, because of the nature of the fall,
[57:24.230 --> 57:27.830]  they'll all race to finish. And as we all have seen,
[57:28.150 --> 57:32.890]  just pre flower and the first 10 days of flower, like once it
[57:32.890 --> 57:35.530]  starts to initiate is when you get the most rapid growth.
[57:36.150 --> 57:40.070]  So we end up having plants that are 15, 20% larger than most
[57:40.070 --> 57:43.410]  in field, just because they set flower a little bit later.
[57:43.590 --> 57:47.270]  And then our plants are usually harvesting about October 15 for a full
[57:47.270 --> 57:51.630]  maturity. They work in most places, as I said. We're in Canada,
[57:51.870 --> 57:57.150]  we're in Montana, Vermont, we've been everywhere in harsh climates,
[57:57.710 --> 58:00.990]  just because they're a little bit hardier than most of what's out there.
[58:00.990 --> 58:04.670]  Again, an advantage of growing up on the West Coast, breeding for coastal
[58:04.670 --> 58:10.710]  climates, and understanding what coastal mold is. So we had an advantage
[58:10.710 --> 58:14.590]  to lean in there and create some hardiness. Interesting.
[58:17.830 --> 58:21.110]  Okay, so this is... I've heard, I mean, this is through
[58:22.150 --> 58:27.230]  anecdotal Instagram posts, but I've heard that plants that have less THC
[58:28.150 --> 58:34.390]  end up having more bud rot issues, because the THC is used for,
[58:35.150 --> 58:38.950]  like as an antifungal. Have you noticed any of that?
[58:39.950 --> 58:44.530]  Well, I'd say that we haven't had a chance to grow a THC version
[58:44.550 --> 58:48.630]  of this exact plant next to a CBD version, but I would say
[58:49.730 --> 58:55.090]  yes, a lot of the CBD and CBG plants mold like crazy.
[58:55.490 --> 58:58.590]  They're botrytis prone as hell, and they just will cause you all kinds
[58:58.590 --> 59:02.130]  of problems. But again, this is why don't go buy
[59:02.970 --> 59:05.370]  genetics from a guy who just started last year.
[59:06.050 --> 59:09.650]  He didn't grow 15 years in a coastal climate to understand
[59:09.850 --> 59:15.890]  the plethora of issues that you have. And look at the core breeding
[59:15.890 --> 59:18.510]  work if you're gonna grow hemp. There are not very many companies out
[59:18.510 --> 59:21.130]  there that are really putting the work in.
[59:22.150 --> 59:25.450]  So a lot of the foundation work is the same foundation work,
[59:25.450 --> 59:27.490]  and if you haven't really proven the lines...
[59:28.390 --> 59:30.530]  The biggest one that I see, to be honest with you,
[59:30.530 --> 59:34.890]  is hermaphroditic potential. Hermaphroditic potential is something that we
[59:34.890 --> 59:40.170]  go pop a bunch of seeds indoor, and we'll remove anything that
[59:40.170 --> 59:43.090]  has hermaphroditic potential, and we can bring those lines forward. Even
[59:43.090 --> 59:46.030]  if it's slightly hermaphroditic, a lot of times we can work that and
[59:46.030 --> 59:49.050]  stabilize it out of them just by growing them a few times.
[59:49.810 --> 59:52.490]  But when you put that outside, you got a one year crop
[59:53.130 --> 59:56.610]  from seed, I see a massive amount of people
[59:57.250 --> 01:00:00.130]  pumping out hermaphroditic back pollen,
[01:00:00.690 --> 01:00:05.010]  almost like a dietary plant. So you're definitely talking about
[01:00:06.590 --> 01:00:11.330]  other issues in breeding besides even the mold resistance. There's just not
[01:00:11.330 --> 01:00:14.570]  a lot of work being done to it. But I would go back
[01:00:14.570 --> 01:00:18.850]  to saying that our genetics are highly mold resistant. They've been grown
[01:00:18.850 --> 01:00:21.450]  everywhere. They've been grown on the coast of Oregon as well,
[01:00:21.450 --> 01:00:25.170]  so on the coast of California as well. So they're highly mold resistant,
[01:00:25.730 --> 01:00:29.970]  very not prone to botrytis, have been grown in fields next to
[01:00:30.570 --> 01:00:36.330]  plants that have heavy, heavy botrytis, and are still doing very well resistant
[01:00:36.330 --> 01:00:39.690]  to it. So what you're saying is not all smokable hemp
[01:00:41.130 --> 01:00:45.210]  has been bred the same, in that it's truly the wild...
[01:00:46.130 --> 01:00:51.170]  I mean, the wild west. I don't know. There's truly a large variety
[01:00:51.970 --> 01:00:57.930]  of quality of... I mean, essentially of quality of hemp is what it
[01:00:57.930 --> 01:01:01.890]  sounds like you're saying. Well, there's a huge variability in the breeding
[01:01:01.890 --> 01:01:06.010]  quality. I mean, it's not as refined as our world. It's just not
[01:01:06.010 --> 01:01:10.850]  as refined as the THC world. And realize it was driven by a
[01:01:10.850 --> 01:01:14.730]  lot of money, a lot of potential to earn a lot of money.
[01:01:14.730 --> 01:01:20.130]  When you go back to 18 and 19, there were millions of seeds sold
[01:01:20.170 --> 01:01:23.690]  at a dollar a seed. And so there were companies that made a
[01:01:23.690 --> 01:01:27.850]  ton of money. And so there were different drivers. I mean, the driver
[01:01:27.850 --> 01:01:33.410]  for us breeding heirlooms or even type one THC cannabis to sell in
[01:01:33.410 --> 01:01:37.930]  10 packs is very different than the driver to try and make millions.
[01:01:37.930 --> 01:01:40.890]  And unfortunately, it brought in a totally different element
[01:01:41.490 --> 01:01:45.010]  to the table to do it. And the byproduct of that element is
[01:01:45.010 --> 01:01:49.930]  people without intention producing genetics that are low quality and hurting
[01:01:50.210 --> 01:01:53.010]  a lot of farmers. And to me, it sounds like
[01:01:54.010 --> 01:01:58.690]  if you're a basement grower and you produce a pack of seeds
[01:01:58.690 --> 01:02:04.370]  that has some herms or whatever, it's a bummer. But on scale,
[01:02:05.210 --> 01:02:10.290]  that's catastrophic. Totally catastrophic. And we've seen farm... So both
[01:02:10.290 --> 01:02:14.170]  between hermaphroditic potential of buying seeds that were feminized and
[01:02:14.170 --> 01:02:19.570]  buying regular seed that was advertised as feminized, we've seen so many
[01:02:19.610 --> 01:02:25.810]  acres just tilled in. In 19 and 20, you have farmers at 500,
[01:02:25.810 --> 01:02:30.490]  600 acre scale that are tilling their entire crop into the ground.
[01:02:30.490 --> 01:02:35.970]  And another crazy element of that, we talk about going back and selecting
[01:02:37.570 --> 01:02:41.690]  seed from genetics that weren't influenced is a lot of those fields,
[01:02:42.210 --> 01:02:46.570]  they're all volunteers the next year. So they till them in,
[01:02:47.170 --> 01:02:50.450]  but if they didn't get to them early enough, you have just fields
[01:02:50.450 --> 01:02:54.730]  acres of volunteers popping up the next year and spreading pollen for
[01:02:55.290 --> 01:03:00.490]  10, 12 miles. That sounds like a complete nightmare.
[01:03:01.890 --> 01:03:04.890]  It's gotta be for a medical grower or a rat grower,
[01:03:04.890 --> 01:03:10.410]  it has to be just the scourge. I have a
[01:03:12.170 --> 01:03:15.210]  severe allergic reaction to pollen. I couldn't imagine
[01:03:16.050 --> 01:03:19.530]  having to work in a pollen field for a day or living by
[01:03:19.530 --> 01:03:24.850]  anything like that. No, no. And even the way that we grow...
[01:03:26.330 --> 01:03:29.050]  Even the way that we grow dice plants for
[01:03:29.810 --> 01:03:35.570]  industrial purposes, I think that's gonna change. I mean, number one,
[01:03:35.570 --> 01:03:40.290]  if you have half the field full of shit that can't give you
[01:03:40.330 --> 01:03:45.370]  your end product, and it only takes 5% of that pollen to actually
[01:03:45.370 --> 01:03:48.290]  pollinate the whole field and give you what you need for your end
[01:03:48.290 --> 01:03:52.250]  product, there's no reason to have the other 45% in field, if that
[01:03:52.250 --> 01:03:56.090]  makes sense. It cuts down, your yield is half. So I think we're
[01:03:56.090 --> 01:04:00.490]  gonna see some evolution. And I alluded to that earlier in the podcast
[01:04:00.490 --> 01:04:04.370]  that this is a wide open field. Anybody who's in our game right
[01:04:04.370 --> 01:04:08.970]  now that wants to cheaply grab some European industrial or...
[01:04:09.570 --> 01:04:12.810]  And I shouldn't say that because a lot of that is protected,
[01:04:12.810 --> 01:04:15.930]  right? When we talk about IP, but wants to grab some kind of
[01:04:16.610 --> 01:04:20.730]  type three with a potential for industrial or has that in their repertoire,
[01:04:20.970 --> 01:04:24.810]  it's a good time to start bringing that out because it's a wide open
[01:04:24.810 --> 01:04:29.090]  world. And although the seed value is different, you're talking about
[01:04:30.850 --> 01:04:33.690]  pounds per acre of seed, so you're really talking about
[01:04:34.690 --> 01:04:39.530]  a lot less value as far as the seed value goes,
[01:04:39.690 --> 01:04:42.970]  but you're also talking about seed that you can produce at scale outdoor
[01:04:42.970 --> 01:04:46.330]  once the genetics are locked and stable.
[01:04:47.530 --> 01:04:49.930]  That's just a wide open field that needs to be
[01:04:51.290 --> 01:04:54.770]  explored a little bit more. I wish more people that were traditional cannabis
[01:04:54.770 --> 01:04:58.410]  people were bouncing over into this world right now while it's wide open.
[01:04:58.610 --> 01:05:03.650]  Everybody needs... Everybody needs to feed their families, and it's a changing
[01:05:03.650 --> 01:05:08.530]  market, man. I think that's one of the most hopeful things that I
[01:05:08.530 --> 01:05:13.730]  have heard in the cannabis industry in many, many years. I've been telling
[01:05:13.730 --> 01:05:17.370]  people to move away from it, but it sounds like there's room.
[01:05:17.890 --> 01:05:21.530]  And to me, it also sounds like there's room with some of these new...
[01:05:23.450 --> 01:05:24.970]  Or these considered
[01:05:27.170 --> 01:05:27.930]  CBG,
[01:05:28.490 --> 01:05:34.170]  all these new... Those aren't terpenes, those are... What are they?
[01:05:34.170 --> 01:05:35.970]  Cannabinoids. Yeah.
[01:05:37.690 --> 01:05:41.170]  I know that... Is that a market that you guys are looking to go
[01:05:41.170 --> 01:05:46.010]  into at all, like CBG or... We're looking at all diverse cannabinoids.
[01:05:46.010 --> 01:05:50.090]  I mean, I'm definitely playing with all the non psychoactive cannabinoids,
[01:05:50.090 --> 01:05:53.490]  but watching the federal legalization come online and certainly looking to do
[01:05:54.050 --> 01:05:57.890]  everything that there is. Always have been in everything that there is,
[01:05:57.890 --> 01:06:02.490]  and always wanna be in everything that there is. I would say the
[01:06:02.490 --> 01:06:07.770]  CBG market, it got... It's saturated. There's a couple of companies out
[01:06:07.770 --> 01:06:12.130]  of Switzerland, and then you have the Oregon CBD company in the States
[01:06:12.130 --> 01:06:17.050]  here that's just pumping the CBG. And the primary reason that they do
[01:06:17.050 --> 01:06:21.970]  that is because nobody has compliant CBD. Farmers wanna grow something to
[01:06:21.970 --> 01:06:25.730]  full maturity and get it into the marketplace, and most of the CBD
[01:06:26.210 --> 01:06:30.170]  hemp out there is actually 0.5, 0.6 when you grow it to a
[01:06:30.170 --> 01:06:34.410]  smokable product. So it was a driver that started it that I wasn't
[01:06:34.410 --> 01:06:39.250]  supportive of, and CBG is easy to make. They filled the market,
[01:06:39.250 --> 01:06:44.570]  but we're focused on other unique cannabinoids. The varans, for one.
[01:06:44.570 --> 01:06:47.690]  I know everybody on this show is probably tuned into the varans,
[01:06:47.690 --> 01:06:52.090]  so we're certainly working on both THCV and CBDV production.
[01:06:52.650 --> 01:06:55.530]  At a scale that makes sense for a guy to grow in field
[01:06:55.530 --> 01:06:59.410]  and isolate that as the cannabinoid if they wanna isolate it.
[01:06:59.650 --> 01:07:04.370]  But I would say, like my heart says, the plant is complex.
[01:07:04.570 --> 01:07:10.210]  The plant has 600 compounds in it. We're not smart enough as human
[01:07:10.210 --> 01:07:13.810]  beings, in my humble opinion, to start breaking those down and stripping
[01:07:13.810 --> 01:07:18.130]  those down and deciding which single one makes sense. Then we're taking
[01:07:18.130 --> 01:07:20.650]  away the power and the beauty of nature to some degree.
[01:07:20.930 --> 01:07:24.570]  I'm a big fan right now of the research and science that's being
[01:07:24.570 --> 01:07:31.250]  done around multi compound deliveries for medical applications. So I'll give
[01:07:31.250 --> 01:07:35.250]  you an example, like a couple of cannabinoids and flavonoids and terpenes
[01:07:35.250 --> 01:07:39.450]  together combined have a certain synergistic effect on one thing.
[01:07:40.090 --> 01:07:43.490]  Because I believe that, at least from what we've seen, I don't know
[01:07:43.490 --> 01:07:48.290]  how much you guys have seen this, but working in the world
[01:07:51.010 --> 01:07:53.770]  I just lost my train of thought. Again, looking at Hawaii sustainable,
[01:07:53.770 --> 01:07:56.370]  CBG won't test hot, but also great. I almost have to take
[01:07:56.370 --> 01:08:00.450]  that comment thread off of there and get on to something else.
[01:08:00.450 --> 01:08:03.690]  There's some good comments. Matter of fact, a minute ago, a gentleman
[01:08:04.290 --> 01:08:09.810]  said on there that in Portugal, when the riff is flowering,
[01:08:09.810 --> 01:08:13.690]  which is Morocco, so he's talking about the riff mountains, that they send
[01:08:13.690 --> 01:08:17.210]  a pollen warning to Portugal is what he said. I've never heard that,
[01:08:17.210 --> 01:08:20.690]  but talking about pollen drift, that's a pretty powerful statement.
[01:08:23.050 --> 01:08:26.250]  Yeah, it would mess my nose up and it would be a super
[01:08:26.250 --> 01:08:28.290]  bummer if you had a crop at that point.
[01:08:29.490 --> 01:08:35.570]  Geez. At least you'd know what it was, it was Moroccan. Yeah,
[01:08:35.570 --> 01:08:38.450]  yeah, exactly. At least you know you had some Moroccan pollen that influenced
[01:08:38.450 --> 01:08:42.170]  your plants, hopefully it was good. Yeah, but anyway, getting back to,
[01:08:42.170 --> 01:08:45.370]  we've been working with Technion for a bit now, a few years,
[01:08:45.370 --> 01:08:50.450]  and doing some pretty deep looks on our genetics from an analytic standpoint.
[01:08:50.530 --> 01:08:52.810]  Most of the tests that we have in the labs here in the
[01:08:52.810 --> 01:08:58.010]  States are looking at maybe 10, 12 cannabinoids and 15 terpenes, if we're
[01:08:58.010 --> 01:09:02.570]  lucky. And we've got stuff coming from Israel that's 150 compounds,
[01:09:02.570 --> 01:09:09.210]  showing that our hemp has 45 quantifiable terpenes and 40 quantifiable cannabinoids.
[01:09:09.210 --> 01:09:14.050]  So it's pretty diverse and complex. And so my thinking is leaning towards
[01:09:14.050 --> 01:09:18.210]  the researchers that are already recognizing that, and one in particular
[01:09:18.210 --> 01:09:24.370]  is in Dedimere, Technion, you've got a company called Canisol that's been
[01:09:24.370 --> 01:09:28.970]  doing those deep looks for us. So if anybody's interested in looking at
[01:09:28.970 --> 01:09:36.010]  their genetics on a deeper level, definitely look up Canisol, C-A-N-N-A-S-O-L,
[01:09:36.850 --> 01:09:42.890]  and they're out of Israel, and they'll give you 153 compound look at
[01:09:42.890 --> 01:09:47.170]  any of your genetics. But Dedi in particular put a white paper out
[01:09:47.170 --> 01:09:53.210]  in 2019 that talks about how when they had... They were doing some
[01:09:53.210 --> 01:09:56.690]  research with this plant material that they were growing, and they've been
[01:09:56.690 --> 01:10:01.010]  looking at it on chromatography. And so these guys at Technion, they have
[01:10:01.010 --> 01:10:06.170]  96 different, or over 90 human disease indications, right? So they get the
[01:10:06.170 --> 01:10:09.370]  cancer, and they have all of this there that they can then infect
[01:10:09.370 --> 01:10:12.850]  the mice with or whatever, and then they can apply the cannabinoids to
[01:10:12.850 --> 01:10:16.130]  it. So in doing all this research, they had discovered that,
[01:10:16.650 --> 01:10:23.610]  I think it was leukemia tumors, but that one grower that was producing
[01:10:23.610 --> 01:10:26.570]  this plant, they're having all this great effect. That grower stopped producing
[01:10:26.570 --> 01:10:31.050]  it, new grower produces plant, efficacy goes way down. They can't figure
[01:10:31.050 --> 01:10:34.810]  out why is this not working? So they go deep in the chromatography,
[01:10:35.650 --> 01:10:38.290]  and they find out there's one compound that's not there,
[01:10:38.730 --> 01:10:42.450]  and they realize it's a critical peak, it's a flavonoid. So that gets
[01:10:42.450 --> 01:10:46.930]  this guy, and this guy is a disciple of Raphael Meshulam, who's the
[01:10:46.930 --> 01:10:51.210]  guy that actually coined THC, discovered THC molecule.
[01:10:52.210 --> 01:10:55.450]  So these guys are pretty important to the whole cannabis deal.
[01:10:56.210 --> 01:10:58.050]  But it got him on a quest to say,
[01:10:58.050 --> 01:11:02.570]  look, we don't think this is single compound science anymore. We think the
[01:11:02.570 --> 01:11:06.370]  plant has it figured out, and we think that it's multiple compounds that
[01:11:06.370 --> 01:11:12.210]  have these high efficacy impacts and will stop these diseases. And so my
[01:11:12.210 --> 01:11:16.050]  point, Jamal, is that that's where we're focused on. I'm not looking at
[01:11:16.050 --> 01:11:21.530]  single compound anymore, and haven't been since we realized you isolate CBD
[01:11:21.530 --> 01:11:26.610]  and the efficacy goes down 90%. So as soon as you add some
[01:11:26.610 --> 01:11:30.650]  other compounds in, a little bit of THC and flavonoids and terpenes or
[01:11:30.690 --> 01:11:34.410]  other cannabinoids, all of a sudden CBD is super effective on the body.
[01:11:34.810 --> 01:11:37.850]  And we learned that a long time ago. So once I learned that,
[01:11:37.850 --> 01:11:41.610]  it's like, well, now I'm a hound dog on this quest. And so
[01:11:41.610 --> 01:11:45.650]  we've really started to work and support the researchers that aren't looking
[01:11:45.650 --> 01:11:50.010]  at single compound science, and our breeding is backing that. So we're
[01:11:50.010 --> 01:11:53.450]  looking at things now, the next thing that we'll be releasing here is
[01:11:53.930 --> 01:12:01.530]  30 to 15 to 1. So that's a 30 to 1 CBD to THC,
[01:12:01.570 --> 01:12:08.490]  and a 15 to 1 CBC, cannabichromine, to THC. So ideally,
[01:12:08.850 --> 01:12:11.530]  looking at here, you guys are gonna get a bunch of flavonoids,
[01:12:11.650 --> 01:12:15.570]  you're gonna get a large quantity of CBD, a large quantity of cannabichromine,
[01:12:15.570 --> 01:12:18.290]  which is a research compound you guys are super interested in,
[01:12:18.490 --> 01:12:21.010]  and a little bit of THC to kick it off, plus all the
[01:12:21.010 --> 01:12:25.210]  terpenes. So that's the direction that our breeding is heading.
[01:12:25.930 --> 01:12:29.170]  We're also looking to spread that out a little bit and help people
[01:12:29.170 --> 01:12:33.170]  to have higher content of CBD, higher content of terpenes,
[01:12:34.370 --> 01:12:38.810]  and still maintain the low THC content, because that's one thing that happens,
[01:12:38.810 --> 01:12:43.330]  you breed out THC, all of the beautiful terpenes and flavonoids wanna go
[01:12:43.330 --> 01:12:47.530]  away with it. So maintaining those is difficult, but those are the directions
[01:12:48.330 --> 01:12:51.970]  that we're trying to head right now. So to me, it sounds like
[01:12:53.090 --> 01:12:57.210]  the industry is really still in the process of really developing.
[01:12:58.290 --> 01:13:05.250]  Oh yeah, very much in its infancy. Do you smoke the products that
[01:13:05.250 --> 01:13:09.610]  you... Do you smoke the flowers that you grow or that people grow?
[01:13:09.730 --> 01:13:14.690]  Is that... Yeah, they're palatable, they're good to consume, but I'm a
[01:13:14.690 --> 01:13:18.250]  traditional cannabis smoker. I would probably smoke
[01:13:19.930 --> 01:13:25.530]  1 100th of the CBD that I would smoke THC flower. So I do...
[01:13:25.530 --> 01:13:28.530]  I have consumed it, I do consume it. Most of where I find
[01:13:28.530 --> 01:13:33.770]  its value is in our soap. So we'll make oil out of it all
[01:13:33.770 --> 01:13:37.490]  day long and ingest the oil and topically apply the oil,
[01:13:37.490 --> 01:13:40.850]  and that's where I find the CBD to have the greatest application.
[01:13:40.850 --> 01:13:43.730]  But man oh man, I tell you what, a guy who has anxiety
[01:13:44.210 --> 01:13:49.490]  or has function problems when they consume THC, can you imagine what a
[01:13:49.490 --> 01:13:54.210]  gift that is to have just a tiny bit of THC, all the CBD,
[01:13:54.530 --> 01:13:59.090]  let's get the terpenes and flavonoids, not even from a consumption standpoint,
[01:13:59.090 --> 01:14:03.450]  but just stimulating their endogenous cannabinoid system. So I see
[01:14:04.210 --> 01:14:09.370]  a whole segment of people and elderly people that want to
[01:14:10.290 --> 01:14:14.850]  consume it or ingest it, but don't wanna have the psychoactive impact.
[01:14:15.010 --> 01:14:18.410]  But I'll be honest with you, Jamal, that's not me. I'm a smoker,
[01:14:18.450 --> 01:14:22.130]  I love to be stoned. For sure, for sure. I was thinking
[01:14:22.810 --> 01:14:26.610]  I would rather just perhaps buy a pound of CBD,
[01:14:28.370 --> 01:14:33.850]  high CBD to make lotions or edibles as opposed to growing it just because
[01:14:34.010 --> 01:14:38.730]  I'd rather grow my high THC plants. And they're honestly harder to come
[01:14:38.730 --> 01:14:44.610]  by. It's not easy to come by a high CBD plant, and
[01:14:45.130 --> 01:14:48.370]  if you get them from seed, they're not all the same.
[01:14:50.530 --> 01:14:53.730]  No, they're not. And I think you just hit the crux of one
[01:14:53.730 --> 01:14:57.090]  of these issues is that the CBD genetics haven't been available in the
[01:14:57.090 --> 01:15:02.210]  same way that the THC genetics have been. And I'm happy to start
[01:15:02.210 --> 01:15:06.650]  to see companies do it. There are a couple of companies out there like
[01:15:06.650 --> 01:15:10.890]  Yellow Hammer that are pushing out type twos and type three high CBD
[01:15:10.890 --> 01:15:14.810]  genetics in 10 packs in FEM or regular so that you can get
[01:15:14.810 --> 01:15:19.690]  access to that. And I would encourage you, Jamal, when you say that about
[01:15:19.690 --> 01:15:23.250]  growing your own plants, try one of these.
[01:15:24.570 --> 01:15:27.450]  And if you're gonna try one, I'm selfish, but try one of ours
[01:15:27.450 --> 01:15:30.570]  and I think you'll enjoy the heck out of growing it. They're really,
[01:15:30.570 --> 01:15:35.170]  really colorful, unique, easy growers, great smell.
[01:15:35.930 --> 01:15:38.530]  But yeah, at the end of the day, now you're gonna end up
[01:15:38.530 --> 01:15:42.050]  not smoking most of it. You're gonna end up putting it in topical.
[01:15:43.250 --> 01:15:48.010]  For sure, for sure. I grew a Susie Q once and it was
[01:15:48.010 --> 01:15:53.450]  just... It's cool, but it was just so small and I grew ACDC,
[01:15:53.450 --> 01:15:58.810]  it's pretty larfy. It didn't really look that nice and I just kind
[01:15:58.810 --> 01:16:03.570]  of... It sounds terrible saying it. I just kind of lost interest in
[01:16:03.570 --> 01:16:04.410]  it. I was like,
[01:16:08.810 --> 01:16:12.330]  but I would be totally into trying one of yours this next year
[01:16:12.330 --> 01:16:18.050]  for sure. Gosh, I had a really good question and it just
[01:16:19.330 --> 01:16:25.610]  slipped my mind. Well, I'll jump in and lean into what you were
[01:16:25.610 --> 01:16:27.490]  just saying if you want to while you think about that,
[01:16:27.490 --> 01:16:30.490]  while it comes back to you and say that we're about... Another thing
[01:16:30.490 --> 01:16:35.530]  we're about to do is we're searching right now, we're doing pheno hunts,
[01:16:36.530 --> 01:16:40.210]  two separate pheno hunts through our Painted Lady in the States,
[01:16:42.010 --> 01:16:44.770]  a separate pheno hunt through our Painted Lady in
[01:16:46.290 --> 01:16:49.450]  Canada, and then we're doing a pheno hunt
[01:16:50.610 --> 01:16:54.210]  that's a mystery pheno hunt for... I don't know if anybody's familiar,
[01:16:54.210 --> 01:16:57.810]  you're familiar with the Grow Off, but the Grow Off has been doing
[01:16:58.370 --> 01:17:02.290]  a pretty neat thing, giving a bunch of growers a single cut and
[01:17:02.290 --> 01:17:05.970]  then letting them compete against each other state to state, well, in each
[01:17:05.970 --> 01:17:09.250]  state. So they've had it going in eight states and this year they're
[01:17:09.250 --> 01:17:13.850]  going to do a 50 state Grow Off because they can with hemp because
[01:17:13.850 --> 01:17:18.530]  the plant can move around 50 states, but we're doing a phenotype selection
[01:17:18.530 --> 01:17:22.650]  for them. And because these are all filial ones that we're working with,
[01:17:22.650 --> 01:17:26.290]  although the population's great to put out in the field and it's gonna
[01:17:26.290 --> 01:17:29.010]  finish the same time and the heights are pretty much the same,
[01:17:29.330 --> 01:17:34.010]  there's a ton of color variance, variability, and there's a ton of
[01:17:35.330 --> 01:17:39.490]  phenotypic traits in there, like different terpene profiles and a bunch
[01:17:39.490 --> 01:17:42.490]  of different stuff going on and a bunch of different ratios.
[01:17:43.050 --> 01:17:48.050]  So we're hoping to come out with and release for 2024
[01:17:48.770 --> 01:17:55.010]  or maybe into 2023 some elite cuts, some selected cuts from us that
[01:17:55.050 --> 01:18:01.450]  are verified clean, all TMV HPLV screened that can go out and be
[01:18:01.450 --> 01:18:05.290]  sold to people like yourself that wanna do this, maybe to retail dispensaries
[01:18:05.290 --> 01:18:08.650]  or whatever, because we're seeing some and I could show you some pictures
[01:18:08.650 --> 01:18:12.770]  of some of these phenotypes that you couldn't tell them from greasy,
[01:18:12.770 --> 01:18:18.370]  oily type one plants, just stink to high heaven, beautiful structure,
[01:18:18.730 --> 01:18:24.450]  super big calyx structure and highly resinous. So we finally decided to
[01:18:24.450 --> 01:18:27.410]  go ahead and look through the work a little bit more and we
[01:18:27.410 --> 01:18:31.930]  wanna breed forward as well, but really stop the population and pick out
[01:18:31.930 --> 01:18:34.730]  the best selections from there. It started, we were working with
[01:18:35.770 --> 01:18:39.050]  Texas A&M and I think I had the first thought of doing this
[01:18:39.050 --> 01:18:43.850]  and we started seeing 55 to ones when most of our population is
[01:18:43.850 --> 01:18:46.450]  30 to one in THC. So I started looking at from a
[01:18:46.450 --> 01:18:51.050]  CBD standpoint, wow, a farmer could produce a third more CBD in the
[01:18:51.050 --> 01:18:56.090]  field from a clone. That makes a clone valuable, but then it's evolved
[01:18:56.090 --> 01:19:00.730]  into, wait, all the growers that I love that might wanna grow CBD,
[01:19:01.090 --> 01:19:04.410]  they deserve to have some CBD that's good. And like I said,
[01:19:04.410 --> 01:19:07.410]  I think Alpine Genetics is one if you wanna look at them.
[01:19:08.050 --> 01:19:12.130]  Yellowhammer Genetics is another one that has some great type threes out
[01:19:12.130 --> 01:19:16.010]  there, but if you're in a position where you don't wanna go over
[01:19:16.010 --> 01:19:20.490]  0.3 and you want something truly non psychoactive, we're really one of the
[01:19:20.490 --> 01:19:23.810]  only options on the market. Other than those two,
[01:19:25.170 --> 01:19:28.570]  there's just nobody that's producing terpene rich and out of the three of
[01:19:28.570 --> 01:19:31.770]  us, and I shouldn't say that, because there may be a couple,
[01:19:31.770 --> 01:19:35.330]  this is just such a widespread industry, but there are very few that
[01:19:35.330 --> 01:19:38.450]  are doing it compliant. So yeah, next year we definitely wanna give
[01:19:38.850 --> 01:19:42.770]  you and many other people an opportunity to grow a highly resinous
[01:19:43.810 --> 01:19:50.210]  CBD variety. That sounds super exciting, super, super exciting. And I figured
[01:19:50.210 --> 01:19:55.850]  out the question, which was, so material that you guys grow in this
[01:19:55.850 --> 01:20:00.410]  industry for it to be type three, it must be under 0.3,
[01:20:00.570 --> 01:20:04.970]  is that correct? It not technically, it's ratio driven type three is,
[01:20:05.010 --> 01:20:06.850]  and the regulatory
[01:20:09.410 --> 01:20:13.250]  limit varies. So you look at it on a global scale,
[01:20:13.530 --> 01:20:18.690]  in the United States, everybody, no question, 0.3 total THC, that's it.
[01:20:19.130 --> 01:20:21.730]  But you go to Mexico, it's 1%. You go to Ecuador,
[01:20:21.730 --> 01:20:25.050]  it's 1%. So there are a few countries that are putting the threshold
[01:20:25.050 --> 01:20:29.010]  at 1%, and honestly, that makes it a lot easier for a farmer.
[01:20:29.050 --> 01:20:35.610]  And that was my main question is, how would this breeding be different if
[01:20:35.610 --> 01:20:40.250]  you had a bit more leeway in your THC percentage? Oh, you know we'd
[01:20:40.250 --> 01:20:43.930]  have double the terpenes. If we can go up to 0.6, 0.7,
[01:20:43.930 --> 01:20:49.210]  we can easily double the terpenes. And we're pushing up to 2%
[01:20:50.450 --> 01:20:53.370]  in terpenes, which is not as high as we'll see on a high
[01:20:53.570 --> 01:20:57.770]  THC variety, but it's very high for these CBD varieties. Most of the
[01:20:57.770 --> 01:21:04.650]  CBD varieties are half a percent, 0.4, 0.6, and those are considered terpene
[01:21:04.650 --> 01:21:08.410]  rich CBD varieties. You go to industrial varieties, you're talking 0.1,
[01:21:08.970 --> 01:21:14.730]  0.2, and less terpene content. But as soon as you give me the
[01:21:14.730 --> 01:21:18.370]  ability to go to 0.6, 0.7 THC, all of a sudden,
[01:21:18.370 --> 01:21:24.010]  man, we can go up 3%, 3.5% total terpene content. And then I
[01:21:24.010 --> 01:21:27.650]  think it gives us... We don't know yet, because we're starting to really
[01:21:27.650 --> 01:21:31.570]  look at some of these other elements, stilbenoids, the thiol studies that
[01:21:31.570 --> 01:21:35.250]  are coming out, right? The sulfur compounds. So there's a whole bunch
[01:21:35.290 --> 01:21:37.770]  of... A whole slew of other things we're not testing for,
[01:21:38.050 --> 01:21:41.850]  because we're just looking at GCMS and looking at mono encescloterpenes
[01:21:41.850 --> 01:21:46.450]  primarily, that probably are going to increase when we pull up THC.
[01:21:46.450 --> 01:21:52.250]  THC is the magic molecule, man. Interesting. Interesting. Is that... Does
[01:21:52.250 --> 01:21:53.970]  it look like that's gonna be in the works at all,
[01:21:53.970 --> 01:21:58.290]  or do you think they're pretty hard fast at 0.3? Oh,
[01:21:58.290 --> 01:22:02.450]  it's coming. We're already... We already have... Part of our catalog is
[01:22:02.450 --> 01:22:07.810]  already designed to be what we call Delta 9 compliant. So although it's
[01:22:07.810 --> 01:22:13.570]  type three, it's pushing that 0.4 and 0.5 envelope, and the idea
[01:22:13.570 --> 01:22:17.610]  being that you can pass on a pre harvest test in the United
[01:22:17.610 --> 01:22:22.170]  States, which is 21 days before harvest, but you won't pass that one
[01:22:23.130 --> 01:22:26.650]  on a full harvest. But the idea there is, yes, we're breeding that
[01:22:26.650 --> 01:22:30.250]  up, breeding that up, and as soon as we have that
[01:22:31.170 --> 01:22:35.490]  legalization, full federal legalization, I think that the chains are off.
[01:22:36.370 --> 01:22:40.770]  I think we'll be pumping out a lot of stuff that's even probably 2%,
[01:22:40.770 --> 01:22:47.130]  3% THC nationally, and then internationally, we'll have a whole catalog
[01:22:47.130 --> 01:22:52.090]  of stuff that's 0.8, 0.7. We already have approvals in Ecuador,
[01:22:52.090 --> 01:22:56.650]  and they're at 1%. The funny thing is, is Yamal, until
[01:22:57.650 --> 01:23:02.010]  the global market opens up, you take a little country like Ecuador
[01:23:02.570 --> 01:23:07.090]  or Colombia, they depend on export markets. So as much as they set
[01:23:07.090 --> 01:23:11.970]  their threshold at 1%, the only thing that they could do then is
[01:23:11.970 --> 01:23:17.370]  extract that higher THC product and then send the CBD isolate out.
[01:23:17.610 --> 01:23:21.250]  Well, the industry has evolved already past that to the point where smokable
[01:23:21.250 --> 01:23:24.850]  flour is the hot product. So even those countries that want 1%,
[01:23:25.450 --> 01:23:30.130]  that are legal at 1%, want 0.3 product because they need internationally
[01:23:30.130 --> 01:23:35.050]  compliant product to ship out. But as soon as that starts to shift
[01:23:35.050 --> 01:23:39.570]  a little and there's more 1% countries, we'll be ready to feed Ecuador
[01:23:40.050 --> 01:23:44.130]  and Mexico and these places with closer to 1%. And yeah,
[01:23:44.130 --> 01:23:47.170]  it's gonna be a game changer when it comes to compound production.
[01:23:47.170 --> 01:23:50.370]  I mean, we've fought and fought and fought through thousands of selections
[01:23:50.410 --> 01:23:53.010]  to get the terpene content that we have.
[01:23:54.050 --> 01:23:57.370]  I think it becomes just an absolute easy thing to do when you
[01:23:57.370 --> 01:24:02.690]  bring the THC molecule along with it. And moving stuff into the Southern...
[01:24:02.690 --> 01:24:07.410]  Is that considered the Southern Hemisphere? Or at least closer to the...
[01:24:08.050 --> 01:24:11.530]  That's not Southern yet. Ecuador is literally the equator. Yeah.
[01:24:11.530 --> 01:24:19.090]  On the... Yeah. Are you guys... Do you have different genetics that are
[01:24:19.130 --> 01:24:22.570]  designed for... I mean, because that's a pretty equatorial type of plant.
[01:24:22.690 --> 01:24:26.490]  Yes, yes. No, this has been one of the most fascinating things for
[01:24:26.490 --> 01:24:30.210]  me too about doing this breeding is, all of a sudden I've been
[01:24:30.210 --> 01:24:35.650]  growing from like 42 to 45 degrees North latitude. And all of a sudden
[01:24:35.650 --> 01:24:38.850]  we're spreading that out. We're sending these all the way up into Canada
[01:24:38.850 --> 01:24:43.170]  and in Alaska, finding out where the threshold is, where they'll produce and
[01:24:43.170 --> 01:24:47.610]  where they'll finish, all the way down to Hawaii. And what's been fascinating
[01:24:47.610 --> 01:24:53.610]  is that these ferro lineages, they do really well closer to the equator.
[01:24:53.610 --> 01:24:58.010]  Now, you get down below about 16 degrees and there's not enough photoperiod
[01:24:58.010 --> 01:25:03.250]  change for them to trigger without supplemental light.
[01:25:04.290 --> 01:25:07.450]  So they need the supplemental light to get good vegetative growth going
[01:25:07.450 --> 01:25:10.890]  and then shut that off to get to flower well.
[01:25:11.770 --> 01:25:14.450]  So most of the stuff that we have in Ecuador and places like
[01:25:14.810 --> 01:25:19.570]  that is all... Or Colombia is all in greenhouse with supplemental lighting
[01:25:20.090 --> 01:25:22.410]  and then shutting down. So they don't need to depth anything,
[01:25:22.410 --> 01:25:26.250]  they need to extend their photoperiod. Right, right, right. But both sides,
[01:25:26.530 --> 01:25:32.010]  we're working in Uruguay, Chile, Argentina, New Zealand, Australia.
[01:25:32.930 --> 01:25:35.770]  So you start getting there and then, like I said, you hit 16
[01:25:35.770 --> 01:25:40.690]  degrees North or South latitude and everything up to about 48 degrees
[01:25:41.690 --> 01:25:46.010]  were able to perform in. And it's been really interesting to see where
[01:25:46.010 --> 01:25:51.250]  other genetics that were in crosses and the work wasn't done as well,
[01:25:51.330 --> 01:25:54.610]  really struggled. As soon as you get them down to even 30 degrees,
[01:25:54.610 --> 01:25:58.090]  you get them down to Florida and Texas, and all of a sudden,
[01:25:58.090 --> 01:26:01.570]  they just don't perform. They won't grow out well and they just have
[01:26:01.570 --> 01:26:05.370]  all kinds of issues. So yeah, it's been a really interesting thing to
[01:26:05.370 --> 01:26:09.930]  watch something that I produced at close to 45 degrees North latitude go
[01:26:10.810 --> 01:26:16.330]  all the way up and down the latitudes. That's amazing. So the main
[01:26:16.330 --> 01:26:22.450]  issue you find is that they don't veg properly and probably stretch and
[01:26:22.450 --> 01:26:28.130]  all of that, transition and have the right size. Yep, yep. And it's
[01:26:28.130 --> 01:26:32.330]  kinda two ways. There are places where if they get going,
[01:26:32.970 --> 01:26:36.770]  they won't ever kick into flower. And then there are places where they
[01:26:36.770 --> 01:26:40.250]  won't get any size vegetative and they just wanna go into flower right
[01:26:40.290 --> 01:26:43.050]  away. As soon as they hit ethylene production and sexual maturity,
[01:26:43.050 --> 01:26:45.650]  they're like, oh, oh, oh, photo period says we got a flower,
[01:26:45.690 --> 01:26:49.890]  right? Right. Yeah. So that's another piece of breeding that I would
[01:26:49.890 --> 01:26:54.810]  say that anybody who's savvy out there right now, who's watching this,
[01:26:54.810 --> 01:26:58.210]  any of our breeder friends that know another place that needs to get
[01:26:58.210 --> 01:27:03.410]  filled right now. And hey, I'm maybe selfish, but anybody who knows this
[01:27:03.410 --> 01:27:07.730]  trick, you can contact me and we'd be happy to help commercialize it.
[01:27:07.730 --> 01:27:11.770]  But what we need is if you look at auto flower plants,
[01:27:11.770 --> 01:27:17.890]  auto flower plants don't need anything other than to reach sexual maturity,
[01:27:17.890 --> 01:27:21.730]  right? To go into flower. But what ends up happening is that they're
[01:27:21.730 --> 01:27:27.250]  designed for places where the photo period is long and it doesn't start
[01:27:27.250 --> 01:27:30.650]  to curve back like it does for us to push flower. So they'll
[01:27:30.650 --> 01:27:34.730]  just flower automatically at a certain rate of maturity. When you move those
[01:27:34.730 --> 01:27:39.570]  genetics closer to the equator, what inevitably happens is they flower quicker
[01:27:39.730 --> 01:27:43.730]  and quicker and quicker, right? So you end up down at the equator
[01:27:43.730 --> 01:27:46.490]  with plants that are like this tall if you try to run auto
[01:27:46.490 --> 01:27:50.090]  flower. And over the last couple of years, there's been a whole subset
[01:27:50.090 --> 01:27:53.970]  of breeders in the hemp side that are selling the idea to these
[01:27:53.970 --> 01:27:57.410]  equatorial farmers that if you put auto flower down here, you do really
[01:27:57.410 --> 01:28:01.690]  well. And then the equatorial farmers trust them because it's not photo periodic
[01:28:02.210 --> 01:28:04.570]  and then they end up with these tiny little plants, right?
[01:28:05.770 --> 01:28:09.570]  The thing that we could really benefit from solving here is a way
[01:28:09.610 --> 01:28:13.930]  to find a plant that is a long period plant that will resist
[01:28:14.330 --> 01:28:19.050]  flowering for a certain period of time in an equatorial climate. So essentially
[01:28:19.050 --> 01:28:25.290]  an auto flower, but one that doesn't turn early, one that will actually
[01:28:25.290 --> 01:28:30.410]  resist and hit... Turn to flowering at 40 days, 35 days of maturity.
[01:28:30.410 --> 01:28:34.170]  So you end up with a good size plant that then will flower.
[01:28:34.410 --> 01:28:38.250]  And if you... Anybody who could crack that code right now,
[01:28:38.250 --> 01:28:41.810]  and I was literally on with the head of the hemp program at
[01:28:41.810 --> 01:28:46.970]  Texas A&M yesterday talking about exactly this. Anyone who can crack that
[01:28:47.850 --> 01:28:51.490]  will... Hey, there's Josh from Yellowhammer, we were just talking about him.
[01:28:52.690 --> 01:28:57.770]  Anybody who can crack that code will have a great lead in for solving
[01:28:57.810 --> 01:29:00.610]  a huge problem with cannabis and hemp. So any breeders out there
[01:29:00.610 --> 01:29:02.450]  that can figure that out, including Josh,
[01:29:03.970 --> 01:29:08.450]  Josh Turner is Yellowhammer Genetics, then we should definitely address that
[01:29:08.450 --> 01:29:14.250]  problem and come after it. That's super fascinating. I mean, so essentially
[01:29:14.250 --> 01:29:19.730]  it's like a narrow leaf variety CBD dominant? It would be,
[01:29:19.730 --> 01:29:22.650]  because we're talking about a hemp plant, the CBD dominant plant,
[01:29:23.050 --> 01:29:25.490]  but the idea being that, look, it pushes off
[01:29:26.130 --> 01:29:29.770]  any kind of sexual maturity for at least 30 to 40 days,
[01:29:30.090 --> 01:29:33.730]  so that you get a good vegetative period before it starts to flower,
[01:29:33.850 --> 01:29:37.930]  and then you can run that closer to the equator, 16 degrees down
[01:29:37.930 --> 01:29:40.970]  to zero and get a sizable crop, and these guys are hungry for
[01:29:40.970 --> 01:29:44.250]  it. And are you noticing that what the plants that grow that way
[01:29:44.250 --> 01:29:47.450]  are... Have too much THC dominance in them?
[01:29:48.450 --> 01:29:51.370]  I don't really see any plants that grow that way. My thought is
[01:29:51.370 --> 01:29:55.290]  talking to you and all the cannabis people out there, if we have
[01:29:55.970 --> 01:29:59.250]  if we can identify a plant with those traits, those characteristics,
[01:29:59.250 --> 01:30:02.130]  it doesn't matter what chemotype it is necessarily,
[01:30:02.850 --> 01:30:08.570]  we can work that away from... So to clarify, you're not saying
[01:30:09.490 --> 01:30:13.890]  just like a Panama Red or a plant that's a sativa, you're saying
[01:30:13.890 --> 01:30:18.490]  something that has an eight or nine week flower period, but just has
[01:30:18.490 --> 01:30:21.170]  an extended, would you consider
[01:30:21.530 --> 01:30:26.130]  like veg time or when it reaches sexual maturity
[01:30:27.170 --> 01:30:31.170]  as a seed? Exactly. You got it. Let's take an indoor scenario with
[01:30:31.170 --> 01:30:35.010]  an auto flower. We turn the lights on 18 hours on an auto flower,
[01:30:35.130 --> 01:30:39.610]  it's gonna grow for 20 days or whatever, 25 days, and then it's gonna
[01:30:39.610 --> 01:30:42.570]  trigger into flower no matter what we do with the photo period.
[01:30:42.850 --> 01:30:46.050]  What we'd like to see is a plant where we leave the 18
[01:30:46.050 --> 01:30:50.330]  hours of photo period running all the time, the plant goes to 40
[01:30:50.330 --> 01:30:53.930]  days before it will set a stigma, before it will start to make
[01:30:53.930 --> 01:30:57.850]  flower, because that way you'd have a sizable vegetative plant. The problem
[01:30:57.850 --> 01:31:00.810]  at the equator is tiny plants, they can't grow anything big.
[01:31:01.010 --> 01:31:03.690]  And if you look, the way they're solving that problem is they'll put
[01:31:03.690 --> 01:31:09.290]  LED string lighting across a hectare. So that's how they solve the problem,
[01:31:09.290 --> 01:31:13.490]  but if you wanted to do this 1000 acres and be a part
[01:31:13.490 --> 01:31:18.890]  of this CBD industrial revolution, then those guys from 16 degrees latitude
[01:31:18.890 --> 01:31:22.730]  down to the equator, both north and south, really would benefit from that
[01:31:22.730 --> 01:31:30.970]  plant. So in growing autos, have you noticed that there is a wide variation
[01:31:30.970 --> 01:31:37.410]  in stretch of them? No, actually no. No. We've noticed that they're pretty
[01:31:37.410 --> 01:31:40.650]  uniform in the way that they wanna flower in their flower time.
[01:31:40.650 --> 01:31:43.810]  The problem with them, if anything, is they're kicking on too early.
[01:31:44.450 --> 01:31:48.130]  In the unstable auto flowers, you'll see a couple that are just tiny,
[01:31:48.890 --> 01:31:53.370]  because they kicked on too early. But again, we haven't done much messing
[01:31:53.370 --> 01:31:56.210]  with auto flower, I really just am talking global picture,
[01:31:57.250 --> 01:32:00.090]  what would benefit all the canvas breeders on the hemp side if they
[01:32:00.090 --> 01:32:03.730]  wanna fiddle around with it. Super interesting.
[01:32:04.810 --> 01:32:08.570]  Super, super interesting. For me, I always thought of it like...
[01:32:09.010 --> 01:32:12.050]  It's like when it's a narrow leaf variety,
[01:32:14.450 --> 01:32:21.770]  like the position between veg and flower was not as distinct often,
[01:32:21.770 --> 01:32:24.930]  you know what I mean? It kind of like transitioned from one into
[01:32:24.930 --> 01:32:32.090]  the other. And often a lot of the flowering time was a lot of that
[01:32:32.210 --> 01:32:43.290]  stretch. Yeah. But yeah, I mean... But I can't think of many varieties
[01:32:43.290 --> 01:32:46.370]  that would then do that and then would flower pretty hard.
[01:32:47.250 --> 01:32:51.450]  Yeah, no, you're right. And that is the... It's not a simple thing
[01:32:52.730 --> 01:32:56.490]  to solve, but it's just it's a big issue that could... Millions of
[01:32:56.490 --> 01:33:00.290]  seeds would be planted in those regions if we had that solution.
[01:33:01.010 --> 01:33:03.610]  And it's not critical for the industry to develop, that's for sure.
[01:33:03.610 --> 01:33:05.690]  This industry is going crazy all by itself.
[01:33:06.730 --> 01:33:09.490]  Interesting, interesting. And would you worry about
[01:33:12.170 --> 01:33:14.930]  your seeds going to places like Columbian because
[01:33:15.730 --> 01:33:19.810]  it's so much brighter there that the plants would create more THC?
[01:33:19.890 --> 01:33:22.530]  Is that a possibility? No, and it is.
[01:33:23.530 --> 01:33:25.050]  This has been a big debate too.
[01:33:25.170 --> 01:33:31.290]  And I would go back and cite... I would cite Larry Smart.
[01:33:31.370 --> 01:33:34.050]  Larry Smart from Cornell University, he did a study on this a
[01:33:34.050 --> 01:33:37.610]  couple of years ago, is how much is environmental influence
[01:33:38.250 --> 01:33:44.330]  impacting THC production? And what he found was without question, it's
[01:33:44.330 --> 01:33:49.610]  genetics, genetics, genetics, genetics. And so we've been in low UVA and
[01:33:49.610 --> 01:33:53.010]  UVB, high UVA, UVB. And this has been a debate for everybody.
[01:33:53.010 --> 01:33:56.050]  I remember the first couple of times that stuff went out of ours in
[01:33:56.050 --> 01:34:00.490]  Hawaii, people were telling us that, oh, that's because of this and this
[01:34:00.490 --> 01:34:04.410]  and that. And I'm like, well, no, you're testing a single plant anomaly
[01:34:04.410 --> 01:34:07.850]  likely. And in the homogenous population, there will be some that are up
[01:34:07.850 --> 01:34:11.130]  here, but there'll be some that are down there. And over time,
[01:34:11.130 --> 01:34:15.170]  we've certainly determined that they tow the line there too, but there's
[01:34:15.170 --> 01:34:19.850]  a lot of debate about environmental influence on THC. And I don't wanna
[01:34:19.850 --> 01:34:22.690]  get into a debate or argument, I would just say, go look at
[01:34:22.690 --> 01:34:29.250]  Larry's sites. I mean, Larry Smart's data from Cornell, he did a really
[01:34:29.250 --> 01:34:34.650]  deep study on it, including our genetics, and came out with a pretty
[01:34:34.650 --> 01:34:37.810]  clear picture that, hey, we can plant these things in a bunch of
[01:34:37.810 --> 01:34:40.730]  different areas, we can apply a bunch of different stress to them,
[01:34:41.290 --> 01:34:46.250]  and they pretty much tow the line in whatever the genetic was across
[01:34:46.290 --> 01:34:49.930]  the board. Interesting. So in that same question,
[01:34:51.450 --> 01:34:55.830]  do you have any examples of the same genetics grown in different parts
[01:34:55.830 --> 01:34:59.810]  of the world and how they came out different?
[01:35:00.890 --> 01:35:03.810]  Yes, very much so, and that's been a really interesting
[01:35:04.610 --> 01:35:11.170]  thing to talk about and learn. First of all, I would answer Levera Tolkien
[01:35:11.170 --> 01:35:16.010]  that I think type one plants should be grown everywhere. I don't think
[01:35:16.050 --> 01:35:20.530]  that people should be prohibited from intoxicating themselves any way that
[01:35:20.530 --> 01:35:23.650]  they want. It's very against the American way.
[01:35:24.450 --> 01:35:28.050]  But what I would say is where we've really found interesting stuff with
[01:35:28.050 --> 01:35:31.810]  seeing production from place to place and then running analytics and secondary
[01:35:31.810 --> 01:35:38.930]  metabolites. So you learn about what the plant... Secondary metabolites being
[01:35:39.170 --> 01:35:43.730]  what a plant, animal, or fungus chooses to produce, not critical for their
[01:35:43.930 --> 01:35:48.410]  development, not critical for their survival necessarily, but it's a choice.
[01:35:50.410 --> 01:35:53.890]  Secondary metabolites in cannabis being flavonoids, stilvanoids, terpenoids.
[01:35:55.210 --> 01:35:59.090]  What we find is that the plant communicates very clearly in its environment.
[01:36:00.930 --> 01:36:03.290]  Plant over... The best example I can give you,
[01:36:04.450 --> 01:36:08.530]  60 miles apart in Virginia, just 60 miles apart, two plantings.
[01:36:09.050 --> 01:36:13.010]  And at the end of the season, we find out through the terpene profiles.
[01:36:13.050 --> 01:36:15.930]  And doing a couple of times because I didn't trust it that way,
[01:36:16.530 --> 01:36:21.130]  that one of these fields is producing a ridiculous amount of a compound
[01:36:21.130 --> 01:36:26.210]  called B. Farnesine. Well, we do a little bit more digging and gee,
[01:36:26.210 --> 01:36:29.290]  what do we find? Well, farnesine, the only place that it's in nature
[01:36:29.650 --> 01:36:33.770]  other than this terpene that plants create is it's a chemical signature that
[01:36:33.770 --> 01:36:35.770]  an aphid gives off when it's dying.
[01:36:37.450 --> 01:36:41.930]  So this plant has clearly figured out the unique trick that when an
[01:36:41.970 --> 01:36:45.890]  aphid comes and attacks it, it starts increasing its farnesine production
[01:36:45.890 --> 01:36:49.890]  and it spreads that across the entire field so that it can combat
[01:36:49.890 --> 01:36:55.810]  the aphid. 60 miles away where there was zero aphid pressure, just corn
[01:36:55.810 --> 01:37:02.250]  and earworm pressure, no farnesine, almost none, right? And a hugely quantifiable
[01:37:02.250 --> 01:37:06.170]  amount of farnesine in this other field. So there are a number of
[01:37:06.170 --> 01:37:09.770]  examples like that. It may get more extreme as you spread the plants
[01:37:09.810 --> 01:37:14.250]  out into different microclimates and regions, but that's where I find
[01:37:14.850 --> 01:37:19.530]  and can clearly say this plant is plastic. It learns, it adapts,
[01:37:19.530 --> 01:37:24.930]  it adjusts immediately in real time to its environment from place to place.
[01:37:24.930 --> 01:37:29.930]  It lets us all know how much it really is living. But yeah,
[01:37:29.930 --> 01:37:34.210]  secondary metabolites will be dramatically different from field to field to
[01:37:34.210 --> 01:37:37.930]  field, depending on what the plant has to encounter and deal with in
[01:37:37.970 --> 01:37:42.130]  its environment. And I imagine that goes to cannabinoid production when we
[01:37:42.130 --> 01:37:45.450]  start to look at nuanced cannabinoid production. Remember right now,
[01:37:45.450 --> 01:37:49.330]  we're only looking at dominant cannabinoids, and those are likely gonna
[01:37:50.250 --> 01:37:54.090]  toe the line for everything in the genetic foundation. But when we start
[01:37:54.090 --> 01:37:57.370]  looking at all the nuanced cannabinoids and understanding what they do,
[01:37:57.930 --> 01:38:03.330]  remembering that there's 140 of them now, and we're gonna know more probably
[01:38:03.370 --> 01:38:07.730]  in another year or two, that we're gonna find out that those are also
[01:38:07.850 --> 01:38:11.370]  doing the same thing. Those are reacting to their environment and they're
[01:38:11.650 --> 01:38:16.490]  produced in levels according to... And now imagine what we can do,
[01:38:16.570 --> 01:38:21.090]  influencing the plant from the outside to get it to produce these compounds
[01:38:21.090 --> 01:38:25.130]  through other ways than breeding. Do you find that
[01:38:27.930 --> 01:38:33.130]  organic farms have different compounds than non organic ones or any trends
[01:38:33.170 --> 01:38:37.530]  with in that area? We haven't gotten there, but I think that's a
[01:38:37.530 --> 01:38:42.010]  great conversation. It opens the door, and this is like... I speak with
[01:38:42.010 --> 01:38:47.210]  Josh regularly from Yellowhammer, that this is a data void. Both of us
[01:38:47.210 --> 01:38:50.370]  understand that. We look at this and it's like, we're just constantly looking
[01:38:50.370 --> 01:38:55.610]  for information to populate this black hole that is cannabis data left by
[01:38:56.490 --> 01:39:00.570]  prohibition. So I think that what you're saying, we're gonna start to see
[01:39:00.570 --> 01:39:04.650]  that. We just haven't spent the time looking. And I would love to
[01:39:05.970 --> 01:39:12.490]  prove that an organic farm has... With a good biome, has a lot
[01:39:12.490 --> 01:39:17.130]  more going on than something that's NPK driven. We certainly see a situation
[01:39:17.130 --> 01:39:20.970]  when I talk about dealing with farmers, where these farmers have learned
[01:39:20.970 --> 01:39:25.330]  that, well, if you want more revenue, just plant another acre,
[01:39:25.730 --> 01:39:29.330]  and don't worry about quality. And the other side of that is,
[01:39:29.530 --> 01:39:34.530]  well, if you don't have enough nutrition, just throw more nitrogen on it.
[01:39:34.770 --> 01:39:38.850]  That's the solution right there. So taking and helping these guys to understand
[01:39:38.850 --> 01:39:41.570]  that the biodiversity of the soil would actually have an impact on their
[01:39:41.570 --> 01:39:45.050]  plant, I think that's a great thing to teach them. And I would
[01:39:45.050 --> 01:39:48.850]  venture to guess that, yeah, with plant plasticity, the plant probably adapts
[01:39:48.850 --> 01:39:54.130]  and loves that really quickly, and likely does produce a bunch more compounds.
[01:39:55.130 --> 01:39:59.770]  Interesting. And I guess this is kind of on the side,
[01:39:59.770 --> 01:40:03.330]  but kind of similar. Things being grown on this large of a scale,
[01:40:03.330 --> 01:40:08.130]  I'm sure are gonna have really interesting bug pressures. Are pesticide
[01:40:08.130 --> 01:40:13.090]  applications, is that an issue in this industry?
[01:40:14.290 --> 01:40:19.970]  Well, new crop. So as... Is a new crop, the way that those
[01:40:20.010 --> 01:40:24.850]  start out is that no pesticide is approved for this crop,
[01:40:25.570 --> 01:40:29.570]  and then slowly they start to approve pesticides. So these farmers have
[01:40:29.650 --> 01:40:34.130]  been dealing with a situation where essentially they can use zero pesticides,
[01:40:34.130 --> 01:40:37.610]  so they have to face whatever comes at them.
[01:40:38.250 --> 01:40:43.210]  I think as we evolve, we're starting to see terpene hydrosols being pulled,
[01:40:43.490 --> 01:40:46.850]  and I think those will come back and be used as pesticides,
[01:40:46.850 --> 01:40:50.650]  just as I referenced farnesine. I think that that's a lot of
[01:40:50.650 --> 01:40:55.410]  what the plant's doing, is it's competing with or combating things in its
[01:40:55.410 --> 01:41:00.170]  environment. So I think we will start seeing that. I am seeing that,
[01:41:00.250 --> 01:41:05.050]  some terpene based pesticide results, and they're phenomenal. You start to
[01:41:05.050 --> 01:41:12.770]  see targeted pest, 98% mortality, and non targeted pest like ladybug and
[01:41:12.810 --> 01:41:18.370]  this and that, 1% mortality. It's exactly what you'd wanna see in a
[01:41:18.370 --> 01:41:21.050]  result. But up to now, these guys have had to deal with it.
[01:41:21.050 --> 01:41:23.410]  I mean, we have a farmer in Malawi right now who called me
[01:41:23.410 --> 01:41:26.410]  the other day, and he's like, Jeremy, what do I do about grasshoppers?
[01:41:26.410 --> 01:41:30.010]  I'm like, what do the grasshoppers do? And he's like, they are literally
[01:41:30.010 --> 01:41:33.490]  chewing the base of the stock and the plants fall over in the
[01:41:33.490 --> 01:41:35.930]  field. They just chew it till the plant falls down.
[01:41:37.050 --> 01:41:39.570]  I'm like, I don't 100% know, and I call
[01:41:40.490 --> 01:41:43.450]  the IPM guys that I know, and the IPM guy says,
[01:41:43.450 --> 01:41:50.250]  well, chickens. He's like, that's about all you can do. You don't have
[01:41:50.250 --> 01:41:54.410]  the ability to apply a pesticide in this situation. Corn earworms and corn
[01:41:54.410 --> 01:41:57.410]  armyworms are another one, aphids are another one, and of course,
[01:41:57.890 --> 01:42:02.410]  now we have the bong aphid. I think that brings up another factor,
[01:42:02.410 --> 01:42:06.650]  is that look, all of us farmers of cannabis indoors, we need to
[01:42:06.650 --> 01:42:10.370]  be responsible and respectful of the fact that we can now spread
[01:42:11.010 --> 01:42:14.810]  root aphids and rustic mites and all of this in field,
[01:42:15.130 --> 01:42:19.170]  and these guys out there need to be responsible too, that they're perpetuating
[01:42:19.170 --> 01:42:22.770]  a pest that can come back and impact these indoor environments.
[01:42:22.770 --> 01:42:26.010]  So there's a lot of responsibility when we can't apply a bunch of
[01:42:26.010 --> 01:42:29.290]  pesticide, that we need to make sure our plants are screened,
[01:42:29.730 --> 01:42:32.930]  make sure that they're clean, and now we have like Brendan McKernan and
[01:42:32.930 --> 01:42:37.690]  Kevin in medicinal genomics that are putting together some great screening
[01:42:37.690 --> 01:42:43.290]  stuff. So they have some QPRC or QPCR testing, sorry, that they can
[01:42:43.290 --> 01:42:46.890]  send out to you and you can get HPLV and tobacco mosaic.
[01:42:48.090 --> 01:42:54.810]  Certainly, starting with clean genetics, don't ever support anybody who would
[01:42:54.810 --> 01:42:57.930]  push out something that's got a medium that's infected with any of this
[01:42:57.930 --> 01:43:01.570]  garbage, but yeah, the responsibility of cross contamination becomes very
[01:43:01.610 --> 01:43:09.290]  real. That's... I mean, that's kind of scary. Imagine a whole aphid infestation
[01:43:09.290 --> 01:43:11.730]  where they have wings and start flying around. I mean...
[01:43:13.370 --> 01:43:16.690]  They're so smart, and these bong aphids are so smart.
[01:43:17.330 --> 01:43:21.210]  I was in a facility recently where... And it's a massive facility,
[01:43:21.210 --> 01:43:26.410]  it's a five acre greenhouse facility, and these guys had brought in 30
[01:43:26.450 --> 01:43:29.690]  clones in a tray that had the bong aphid on them,
[01:43:30.170 --> 01:43:33.610]  and those things took over a five acre facility in a matter of
[01:43:33.610 --> 01:43:38.330]  30 days, right? So they're so smart. They're born pregnant, they get wings
[01:43:38.330 --> 01:43:41.170]  when they need to get wings. It's like these things are highly evolved,
[01:43:41.170 --> 01:43:45.130]  so we do have a huge responsibility as we let these guys,
[01:43:45.130 --> 01:43:48.370]  these farmers grow out in the field to not infect us.
[01:43:48.770 --> 01:43:53.250]  And flip side of that is all these young novice cannabis farmers,
[01:43:53.250 --> 01:43:57.610]  I want them to understand that I grew up in an era where
[01:43:58.450 --> 01:44:04.890]  we didn't have pest problems. And I never saw anything but a spider mite
[01:44:05.250 --> 01:44:13.570]  until maybe 2002, 2004. I never saw a powdery mildew until 2014.
[01:44:14.130 --> 01:44:17.690]  So we have a situation where now dispensaries come online and they can
[01:44:17.690 --> 01:44:23.010]  push out clones in dirty medium. Novice growers just know that we're hurting
[01:44:23.010 --> 01:44:28.090]  everybody when we bring dirty genetics in. So not only from a pest standpoint,
[01:44:28.090 --> 01:44:31.890]  but from a pathogen and virus standpoint, man, start holding these guys
[01:44:31.890 --> 01:44:35.130]  accountable. I can promise you that any nursery you see with this brand
[01:44:35.130 --> 01:44:41.970]  on it will absolutely be screen genetics that do not have any living pests
[01:44:41.970 --> 01:44:45.250]  on them, but also are screened for any of this stuff. Because we talk
[01:44:45.250 --> 01:44:49.250]  about spreading from us to us, hey, it's tobacco mosaic virus,
[01:44:49.730 --> 01:44:53.930]  right? It can spread from our crop to tobacco as well.
[01:44:54.570 --> 01:45:00.810]  We watched in Central Oregon, maybe 20 some years ago, verticillian wilt came
[01:45:00.810 --> 01:45:05.370]  in and killed the mint industry. There was a really strong and thriving
[01:45:05.370 --> 01:45:10.850]  mint industry and one pathogen comes in and boom, wipes out a whole industry.
[01:45:10.850 --> 01:45:14.450]  So we have a responsibility too as we start to grow this stuff at scale
[01:45:14.450 --> 01:45:19.970]  to not get these other industries hurt. For sure. And I would say
[01:45:20.250 --> 01:45:27.010]  for the home grower, a few cheap steps is don't share clones that aren't
[01:45:27.010 --> 01:45:32.650]  vigorous. Always look, whenever you transplant, look at your roots and just
[01:45:32.650 --> 01:45:36.530]  expect to see root aphids and be surprised if you don't see them.
[01:45:37.370 --> 01:45:41.770]  You just expect to see them, look for them to find them. And then
[01:45:41.770 --> 01:45:43.610]  if you don't see them, then great, you don't have them,
[01:45:43.610 --> 01:45:46.930]  but expect to see them, know how to treat them. And for me,
[01:45:46.930 --> 01:45:53.010]  the cheapest and most useful thing is get yourself a microscope for your
[01:45:53.010 --> 01:45:57.170]  computer. You can get them for like 30 bucks and you can look and
[01:45:57.170 --> 01:46:01.930]  scope your plant and scope a clone and you can see every little,
[01:46:02.490 --> 01:46:05.210]  I guess it's like a vein or like a rib on the plant
[01:46:05.210 --> 01:46:07.650]  and you can see any bugs that are on there. You can see
[01:46:07.650 --> 01:46:10.850]  if they're alive, see if they're dead, eggs, poop,
[01:46:11.650 --> 01:46:15.130]  all of those things. And so you can just have as much knowledge
[01:46:15.130 --> 01:46:21.090]  as possible. And it sounds like the HPLV tests aren't terribly expensive.
[01:46:21.850 --> 01:46:26.210]  How much is the test these days? Oh, those QPCR tests are cheap.
[01:46:27.050 --> 01:46:30.010]  Those guys make that stuff super affordable. I don't wanna quote, but I'd
[01:46:30.010 --> 01:46:33.050]  say it's probably 20, $25 for each one of those.
[01:46:34.210 --> 01:46:37.530]  Whoever's here, Justin Cooney says, rubber is riding on ice right now.
[01:46:37.570 --> 01:46:40.170]  One pathogen and there will be a global financial collapse.
[01:46:41.250 --> 01:46:44.850]  People that recognize that kind of stuff, it's really important that we
[01:46:44.850 --> 01:46:48.130]  see this. You have a great group of people in here. I saw
[01:46:48.130 --> 01:46:52.130]  the Rotten Skateboards popped up and said, talking about the Dogon legend
[01:46:52.130 --> 01:46:56.650]  again. Now he's talking about cannabis and cannabi being two dogs.
[01:46:57.930 --> 01:47:04.010]  Yeah. Yeah, yeah, for sure. I learned about that. That was super interesting.
[01:47:04.210 --> 01:47:07.810]  To me, as a stoner, I was like, and chem dog is one
[01:47:07.810 --> 01:47:14.290]  of the best strains too. How is that? Yeah, that Dogon legend is a
[01:47:14.290 --> 01:47:16.770]  pretty interesting one, for sure, for sure.
[01:47:18.970 --> 01:47:23.330]  So yeah, I guess that was most of the things that I really
[01:47:23.330 --> 01:47:28.970]  wanted to touch on. Is there anything else that you'd like to add?
[01:47:28.970 --> 01:47:35.450]  Blake? I guess I would just say that from our side,
[01:47:36.090 --> 01:47:40.290]  give the pitch. You can find us at davishempfarms.com. You can learn about
[01:47:40.290 --> 01:47:45.610]  the company. I'm easily accessible. I'm 30 years in cannabis. Anybody who
[01:47:45.610 --> 01:47:49.690]  wants to talk cannabis, who has a question, who wants to learn,
[01:47:49.890 --> 01:47:52.250]  if I'm there to answer it, if I have the answer,
[01:47:52.250 --> 01:47:54.090]  I'm there to share it. No question about it.
[01:47:54.970 --> 01:47:58.050]  And I guess I would also add that from my side,
[01:47:58.050 --> 01:48:02.930]  we are moving into type one and type two, have been working on
[01:48:03.210 --> 01:48:07.730]  genetics for years now, bringing back to surface some of the stuff.
[01:48:07.770 --> 01:48:11.730]  And mostly, I think it would be fascinating to the group here because
[01:48:12.450 --> 01:48:17.330]  of the fact that we're taking old genetics and breeding new genetics out
[01:48:17.330 --> 01:48:20.850]  of them. We're trying to go back to the foundation and the goal
[01:48:20.850 --> 01:48:25.330]  being eventually to get to where we can take heirloom and heirloom
[01:48:26.090 --> 01:48:30.490]  and create what was created for us that we built all these polyhybrids
[01:48:30.490 --> 01:48:35.130]  off of. We were given a gift by these people in the 60s and
[01:48:35.130 --> 01:48:40.690]  70s who went around the world and brought drug based cultivars back for
[01:48:40.690 --> 01:48:44.130]  us and then bred them together. And we have literally been riding on
[01:48:44.130 --> 01:48:49.090]  that work since then. Even the Dutch have been riding on that work.
[01:48:49.330 --> 01:48:52.530]  A lot of people don't understand that back in the 90s,
[01:48:52.850 --> 01:48:55.930]  the Dutch just had a better regulatory system. So they were able to
[01:48:55.930 --> 01:48:58.890]  get a lot of genetics and then push them out through seed companies.
[01:48:58.890 --> 01:49:03.650]  But the bulk of those genetics are Oregon, California based. And I shouldn't
[01:49:03.650 --> 01:49:07.730]  say the bulk, that could be debatable, but a large percentage of those
[01:49:08.090 --> 01:49:12.770]  genetics came from us, brought back there. And so they're the same work
[01:49:13.130 --> 01:49:16.330]  of the same generation of hippies that were picking that up.
[01:49:16.490 --> 01:49:19.690]  And we haven't done anything to move that forward really yet until this
[01:49:19.690 --> 01:49:23.770]  last year or two when conversations like this with you, Jamal, start to
[01:49:23.770 --> 01:49:27.850]  happen. We're starting to fuel a passion to get out of the box
[01:49:27.890 --> 01:49:31.330]  to breed something special. And guys, we gotta do it quick,
[01:49:31.570 --> 01:49:34.370]  because there's a war of genocide that's been going on for a long
[01:49:34.370 --> 01:49:39.410]  time and the diversity is limiting. It's not gaining. I guess I would
[01:49:39.410 --> 01:49:44.210]  add on there, we do seed increases, preservation seed increases.
[01:49:45.210 --> 01:49:49.410]  Four that I could offer to anyone that's watching this feed and including
[01:49:49.410 --> 01:49:54.250]  you, Jamal, we have done a Tora Bora, that's an early 80s Tora Bora.
[01:49:54.650 --> 01:49:59.690]  We have done a true 1975 Acapulco Gold. We have done a Highland
[01:49:59.690 --> 01:50:05.730]  Tai. And we have done a true Katama non influenced Baldia. So what
[01:50:05.730 --> 01:50:10.450]  I mean, I mean non influenced by outside US genetics like DNA and
[01:50:10.450 --> 01:50:14.410]  non influenced by what was earlier influence on it is the Afghani genetics.
[01:50:14.770 --> 01:50:18.530]  So we've done preservation work and increases on those so that I have
[01:50:18.810 --> 01:50:23.410]  5 to 6,000 seeds of every one of those varieties that I'm willing
[01:50:23.410 --> 01:50:27.410]  to offer. Those are four that we've opened up to anybody on this
[01:50:27.410 --> 01:50:31.330]  thing. And I'm not talking about a dollar. I'm talking about you want
[01:50:31.330 --> 01:50:34.770]  seed. This is how we built this industry. This is how we built
[01:50:34.770 --> 01:50:38.050]  the foundation of the cannabis space that we have today, which is just
[01:50:38.050 --> 01:50:43.450]  an incredibly beautiful thing, is by generosity, caring, reciprocity and
[01:50:43.450 --> 01:50:47.770]  giving. So anybody needs any of or wants to work with any of
[01:50:47.770 --> 01:50:51.930]  those four lines, just reach out to me at davishempfarms.com, jeremy
[01:50:51.930 --> 01:50:56.130]  at davishempfarms.com and we can set it up. We have fulfillment so we
[01:50:56.130 --> 01:50:58.690]  can set it up to get you those seeds. All I would ask
[01:50:58.690 --> 01:51:01.210]  is, look, if I'm gonna spend the shipping cost and I've done the
[01:51:01.210 --> 01:51:05.050]  work to produce the seed, let us know. Tell us what you find.
[01:51:05.330 --> 01:51:08.130]  Tell us what you breed forward and do what we've all done.
[01:51:08.610 --> 01:51:12.650]  Maintain the lineage. Keep the name true. Don't do what these new
[01:51:12.650 --> 01:51:16.770]  MSOs are doing and start concealing and hiding the core where these
[01:51:16.770 --> 01:51:22.610]  genetics came from. Yeah, man, that's super roots. I mean, that's what
[01:51:22.610 --> 01:51:26.930]  it's about. That's what this... I don't know. To me, that's what it's
[01:51:26.930 --> 01:51:32.770]  about. And even from like... It's like you often get more from giving.
[01:51:33.050 --> 01:51:39.130]  You know what I mean? That's what it's about. That's what this plant
[01:51:39.130 --> 01:51:41.850]  is about and building these relationships.
[01:51:43.770 --> 01:51:46.690]  So hell yeah, I'll definitely take you up on that. I would love
[01:51:46.690 --> 01:51:52.210]  to look into some Acapulco gold for sure. Yep, yep. And that Acapulco gold
[01:51:52.210 --> 01:51:56.850]  was a 1975 Acapulco gold. It was verified family lineage, right?
[01:51:57.530 --> 01:52:01.930]  Six seeds germinate out of 10. That's the narrowest increase that we've
[01:52:01.970 --> 01:52:06.890]  done. There was one male in the population and we pollinated the five
[01:52:06.890 --> 01:52:10.530]  females with that one male. So it's gonna be narrow, but it's gonna
[01:52:10.530 --> 01:52:16.690]  be true. And the Katama one, that's a broader example where we were able
[01:52:16.690 --> 01:52:22.650]  to have 10 males and 20 females. So you get a much broader picture.
[01:52:23.050 --> 01:52:27.050]  But yeah, I'm ready to send that work out to anybody that wants
[01:52:27.610 --> 01:52:30.690]  it. No question. That's super awesome. I love
[01:52:32.090 --> 01:52:36.290]  your passion and I really respect your follow through, because I feel like
[01:52:37.090 --> 01:52:39.970]  there aren't as many people... There's a lot of people with passion,
[01:52:39.970 --> 01:52:44.850]  but it's difficult to get the follow through. Obviously, it took a lot
[01:52:44.850 --> 01:52:49.730]  of funding and dedication to run all these projects. I mean,
[01:52:50.730 --> 01:52:51.930]  farming is not cheap.
[01:52:57.690 --> 01:53:01.810]  I'm a bit in awe. I'm just like, damn, this is how it
[01:53:01.810 --> 01:53:06.850]  should be. It's planned out. You obviously know your stuff. Did you go
[01:53:06.850 --> 01:53:10.490]  to school at all for breeding? I mean, you seem to really know
[01:53:10.490 --> 01:53:16.850]  your stuff. Well, so I did pursue a degree in basic plant biology
[01:53:17.330 --> 01:53:19.410]  at Oregon State University. Did not graduate.
[01:53:22.530 --> 01:53:30.650]  Later on in life, I did go to pursue a seed breeding biotechnology certificate
[01:53:30.650 --> 01:53:34.210]  at UC Davis. So I hold that. But the truth is,
[01:53:34.210 --> 01:53:38.810]  is look, man, this is self taught. This is passion. Anybody who's worked
[01:53:38.810 --> 01:53:41.090]  with the plant for a while knows the plant's here to teach us
[01:53:41.090 --> 01:53:45.210]  a lot. And that's really where it comes from. I mean, I'm just
[01:53:45.250 --> 01:53:50.970]  a guy who in 1992 knew some old school guys who were growing
[01:53:50.970 --> 01:53:53.850]  black market and were tired and were like, look, we wanna teach you
[01:53:53.850 --> 01:53:58.370]  young puppy. Let's show you this system and clone only again,
[01:53:58.850 --> 01:54:02.890]  starting there. And then four or five years beyond that, just found this
[01:54:02.890 --> 01:54:06.490]  deep, deep passion for the plant, which has led me a lot of
[01:54:06.490 --> 01:54:10.930]  places in the world. And again, it's not... Anybody with a high school
[01:54:10.930 --> 01:54:14.130]  or less education, as far as I'm concerned, that has a passion for
[01:54:14.170 --> 01:54:17.570]  it can jump right in and work with this plant and should.
[01:54:17.850 --> 01:54:20.890]  If your heart is in the right place, that's what it's about.
[01:54:22.250 --> 01:54:25.810]  Yeah. I mean, it seems that the plant is able to decipher that
[01:54:25.810 --> 01:54:33.410]  often. What a statement. What a statement, Jamal. And that is profound.
[01:54:33.610 --> 01:54:38.450]  No question about it. I will not argue that. We literally put that
[01:54:38.450 --> 01:54:43.330]  in stone. This plant knows what people's intentions are. It seems to.
[01:54:43.490 --> 01:54:46.530]  It seems like that's where you get the... For me, it's like that's
[01:54:46.530 --> 01:54:50.490]  really where the enjoyment comes. It's like, do I like to get high?
[01:54:50.490 --> 01:54:57.090]  Sure. But making connections with like minded people, in my opinion,
[01:54:57.090 --> 01:55:03.090]  is kind of what life is about. And without cannabis, would we be able
[01:55:03.090 --> 01:55:08.090]  to have this conversation? No. Same with like without Future Cannabis Project,
[01:55:08.090 --> 01:55:11.850]  which is like that same kind of energy of like, let's put it out
[01:55:11.890 --> 01:55:15.250]  there and talk about it and get some... And learn about cannabis.
[01:55:16.530 --> 01:55:18.730]  And it's a beautiful thing to learn about.
[01:55:20.370 --> 01:55:22.810]  It is. It's a gift to us all, and we're lucky to be
[01:55:22.810 --> 01:55:26.330]  here. You know what? We can create a better world through cannabis.
[01:55:26.330 --> 01:55:29.010]  There's no question about it. This is a global movement now,
[01:55:29.010 --> 01:55:31.970]  and we're all at the core of it because we're here in the
[01:55:31.970 --> 01:55:35.930]  West. And I've been here doing it for so long, but the reality
[01:55:35.930 --> 01:55:39.610]  is, is this is an opportunity to create a better world through cannabis.
[01:55:39.650 --> 01:55:42.650]  What you just said is very profound. The plant shapes us,
[01:55:42.650 --> 01:55:46.330]  the plant guides us a little bit. She's given us so much.
[01:55:46.330 --> 01:55:50.370]  I mean, she's given us food, fuel, fiber, medicine, all the way around.
[01:55:50.650 --> 01:55:54.490]  Everything we ask for, the plant seems to provide. A lot of our
[01:55:54.490 --> 01:55:58.250]  breeding was done through intention, as we talked about earlier. So I think
[01:55:58.250 --> 01:56:01.530]  it's just a really unique moment in history where if we grab this,
[01:56:01.530 --> 01:56:05.090]  we could make a change for our children's children. If we don't,
[01:56:05.410 --> 01:56:10.450]  we may not, but I'm hopeful. Hell yeah, I'm hopeful too.
[01:56:11.730 --> 01:56:15.650]  Yeah, I appreciate the conversation we had today.
[01:56:16.690 --> 01:56:19.890]  I would encourage people to check out
[01:56:21.570 --> 01:56:26.290]  Jeremy's website. I just looked into one of your podcasts and it was
[01:56:26.290 --> 01:56:33.890]  super informative. So definitely there's more information on his website.
[01:56:34.530 --> 01:56:40.050]  It's a really good, very thorough website with a lot of really interesting
[01:56:40.050 --> 01:56:45.570]  information. So yeah, I would encourage people who are interested
[01:56:46.530 --> 01:56:50.290]  just in cannabis in general to check out his website, to check out his
[01:56:50.290 --> 01:56:59.170]  company. And yeah, I think that's pretty much it for today. If in the
[01:56:59.170 --> 01:57:02.530]  chats we didn't get your questions, it's often just because I'm really
[01:57:02.530 --> 01:57:07.330]  trying to pay attention to the guest and especially when it's a really
[01:57:07.330 --> 01:57:13.170]  information dense subject and I'm a stoner, I can't really multitask. So I
[01:57:13.170 --> 01:57:18.050]  was really trying to pay attention to you. So does Davis Farms sell seeds?
[01:57:18.050 --> 01:57:25.330]  Yes, they do sell seeds. And I would check out his website to find out how
[01:57:25.330 --> 01:57:25.890]  to buy seeds.
[01:57:25.890 --> 01:57:33.010]  Davishempfarms.com, D-A-V-I-S-H-E-M-P-F-A-R-M-S.com. I'm Jeremy, J-E-R-E-M-Y
[01:57:33.010 --> 01:57:37.170]  at Davishempfarms.com. If anybody has a question for me here that I can
[01:57:37.170 --> 01:57:42.130]  answer, please don't reach out. This is my community. Even though I'm a CEO
[01:57:42.130 --> 01:57:46.850]  and founder of this multinational company, I'm really grounded and rooted
[01:57:46.850 --> 01:57:51.490]  in everything that we have in the culture and want to see us make the most
[01:57:51.490 --> 01:57:55.010]  of the opportunity. So yeah, don't hesitate to reach out to me at all.
[01:57:55.490 --> 01:57:59.330]  Appreciate you having me on here Jamal. It's a really cool thing that you're
[01:57:59.330 --> 01:58:03.810]  doing and pushing out and promoting. I think you're going to see in a couple
[01:58:03.810 --> 01:58:09.010]  of years that you set a lot of the tone for where we're heading with this plan.
[01:58:09.010 --> 01:58:10.770]  At least I'm hopeful again that that's the case.
[01:58:11.650 --> 01:58:19.490]  Thank you. I'm really hopeful too. The cannabis industry takes many faces and
[01:58:19.490 --> 01:58:24.210]  I would always encourage everybody to maybe step out of just being a flower
[01:58:24.210 --> 01:58:29.410]  producer. There's many different ways that you can find yourself in this
[01:58:29.410 --> 01:58:36.130]  industry and just to grow as a person. We're not here forever, so enjoy
[01:58:36.130 --> 01:58:41.490]  yourself. Yes, life is short. Live it, man. Thank you so much for having me. I
[01:58:41.490 --> 01:58:46.050]  hope that I offered some insight to some people, some passion, engaged some
[01:58:46.050 --> 01:58:51.250]  people just like you. Let's take this far and wide. So thank you. I really
[01:58:51.250 --> 01:58:55.330]  appreciate the opportunity, man. Heck yeah, man. I appreciate you and I
[01:58:55.330 --> 01:59:01.890]  appreciate everybody on the show for listening. Yeah, I guess we're done.
[01:59:03.010 --> 01:59:09.800]  Take care. Everybody have a great day. Thank you.
