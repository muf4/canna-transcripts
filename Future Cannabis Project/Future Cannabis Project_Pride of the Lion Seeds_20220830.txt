[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  era
[00:02.560 --> 00:06.660]  All right, and we are live so yeah now we're just talking a
[00:08.040 --> 00:10.040]  Rebel grown Dan
[00:10.720 --> 00:12.720]  Pomerantz and
[00:13.320 --> 00:17.600]  His crew and you you know one of the guys, right?
[00:18.400 --> 00:26.080]  Yeah, not super. Well, but we met at the conference and he's a stand-up dude and he seems really community-based
[00:27.080 --> 00:28.480]  his
[00:28.480 --> 00:33.280]  Insta is good people gardens and he's gonna be donating some seeds to Daga
[00:34.560 --> 00:39.000]  awesome, and that to give people context that is for the
[00:40.120 --> 00:42.120]  basically veterans
[00:42.600 --> 00:45.280]  people with medical conditions or if you're just
[00:47.040 --> 00:49.040]  Don't have a lot of money
[00:50.120 --> 00:53.480]  If you if you fit one of those three criteria
[00:53.480 --> 00:58.360]  We have a very small but hopefully growing program where you just pay the shipping and we'll
[00:59.000 --> 01:01.640]  we'll get you a an eclectic mix of
[01:02.800 --> 01:09.160]  Yeah, I mean usually when I pack stuff up, it's like some auto flower so that you can get something quick
[01:09.800 --> 01:14.080]  It's like some high CBG some high CBD
[01:15.960 --> 01:17.960]  And then
[01:17.960 --> 01:20.320]  You know some breeder packs like
[01:20.440 --> 01:25.560]  Crocketts sending a bunch of stuff down obviously Tony Boneyard is the
[01:26.600 --> 01:28.600]  the primary
[01:29.320 --> 01:31.320]  champion of the cause
[01:32.480 --> 01:34.480]  And I
[01:35.920 --> 01:43.640]  Just I just talked to Jackson about I'm doing an open pollination of his
[01:45.880 --> 01:47.880]  It's lime one
[01:48.000 --> 01:52.000]  It's lime one crossed with
[01:55.120 --> 01:57.840]  Grape soda skunk cross with so that
[01:58.800 --> 02:00.800]  crosswoods Sherry West and
[02:01.560 --> 02:05.120]  Oh my god. Look who is has tuned in
[02:06.640 --> 02:08.640]  My hair
[02:08.840 --> 02:12.400]  How is the fresh poo Oh false alarm
[02:13.800 --> 02:17.120]  But still got everyone out of bed and you know
[02:18.880 --> 02:23.040]  You usually so we're talking little kids and
[02:23.640 --> 02:29.680]  and poop which is a favorite topic in my household and usually my kids will like
[02:30.400 --> 02:35.320]  Not have to do anything like that until it's like time to go to bed or time to take a nap
[02:35.320 --> 02:41.000]  and then suddenly it's like I have to poop and it's like you didn't have to poop for the
[02:41.600 --> 02:44.480]  12 hours before it was bedtime or I
[02:45.480 --> 02:50.440]  I might have actually fallen asleep had she not had to go poop though. So, you know
[02:51.560 --> 02:56.000]  Cuz lat last we checked in you were you had lots of energy and you were
[02:58.480 --> 03:00.560]  I have no energy right now, but uh
[03:02.440 --> 03:09.160]  Yeah, you lay down with the kids for story time and the melatonin just kicks in you're done for it's like I have the hardest
[03:09.160 --> 03:11.160]  time staying awake a
[03:11.920 --> 03:13.920]  Hundred percent of the time when I
[03:14.960 --> 03:17.480]  Put my kids to sleep. I'm just like
[03:18.440 --> 03:20.160]  I'm ready to
[03:20.160 --> 03:26.560]  You have three kids too, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, the youngest took her first I
[03:28.080 --> 03:30.080]  Would say her first
[03:30.480 --> 03:32.880]  Like three to four steps today
[03:33.600 --> 03:35.880]  Okay, so it was a big day in
[03:36.640 --> 03:38.640]  in the survey household
[03:39.120 --> 03:40.800]  and
[03:40.920 --> 03:42.920]  She turns one in
[03:45.080 --> 03:50.840]  Well on September 3rd, so what's is today the last day of August or are there 31 in August
[03:52.080 --> 03:54.080]  I'm born on a leap year. I don't pay attention
[03:55.920 --> 04:00.960]  All right, well either in three days or four days it's her birthday but uh
[04:01.880 --> 04:07.240]  So well 31 31 31. Okay 31 days in August
[04:08.320 --> 04:09.640]  but uh
[04:09.640 --> 04:10.920]  so
[04:10.920 --> 04:15.600]  Daniel Morford heart rock mountain farm and the pride of the lion seeds
[04:16.720 --> 04:21.600]  You are based up in Mendocino. So yeah, you want to
[04:22.520 --> 04:24.520]  give us some background on
[04:25.280 --> 04:31.080]  Kind of I know I I mean it's funny because I think a lot of people watching are like that's the dude from those videos
[04:33.320 --> 04:37.200]  With his dad like the Travis right there
[04:40.040 --> 04:46.520]  He was talking about how chill your dad was in that one bit we need more like more cowbell, what's your dad's name?
[04:51.140 --> 04:55.340]  Can you hear me cliff Oh cliff yeah, we need more cliff. Oh
[04:59.760 --> 05:05.680]  Dude my mic go away. Yeah. Oh now you're back. Yeah, I couldn't tell it was me or
[05:08.780 --> 05:10.780]  Yeah, well he's uh
[05:11.420 --> 05:14.380]  Moving back up to the farm. So we're gonna see more of them. Oh
[05:15.380 --> 05:17.380]  Oh cool, so how far
[05:18.060 --> 05:23.740]  Away, does he live and and how big is the farm because he it was his farm originally, right?
[05:24.460 --> 05:26.940]  So you can hear me now. Yeah, and
[05:29.220 --> 05:31.220]  There's a like a big delay
[05:36.500 --> 05:40.610]  Little spotty
[05:41.010 --> 05:43.090]  So could be the internet art
[05:44.890 --> 05:48.690]  Okay, the delay seems last yeah now we can hear you okay, yeah
[05:50.330 --> 05:54.010]  So, yeah, it was his farm originally we moved off the mountain though when I was like in high school
[05:55.330 --> 05:57.330]  down to the valley floor and
[05:58.530 --> 06:00.530]  actually in
[06:00.650 --> 06:04.770]  2003 the house I grew up in up on the farm burned down and
[06:07.330 --> 06:09.930]  So my dad which lived in other places
[06:12.530 --> 06:14.530]  And
[06:15.690 --> 06:17.690]  So, I'm I'm about
[06:18.690 --> 06:23.650]  80 acres from the farm right now. There's two parcels in between where I'm living right now
[06:24.690 --> 06:26.690]  and the farm
[06:26.810 --> 06:32.290]  Because I was living in a yurt with no power no water when we got pregnant with our first
[06:32.770 --> 06:39.730]  So we we decided we'd go rent something and have running water to raise children
[06:40.210 --> 06:42.210]  Which was super helpful
[06:42.330 --> 06:45.850]  And it's changed since when I grew up there like when I grew up there
[06:45.850 --> 06:53.010]  You know all the ganja was dried in the attic, you know, like you it wasn't like a commercial operation
[06:53.930 --> 06:57.690]  so it's it's nice to have a little bit of you know separation with the
[06:58.210 --> 07:00.530]  With the family and the commercial farm
[07:01.210 --> 07:03.210]  Even though it is still small-scale
[07:05.090 --> 07:11.730]  So you you but you so you drive the 80 miles every like oh no 88 80 acres
[07:12.050 --> 07:15.610]  Oh, it's just two parcels, it's I don't know what that
[07:16.490 --> 07:23.490]  What or sorry? Yeah, how far away do you live from the farm? Oh just a couple minutes by four
[07:24.530 --> 07:29.890]  Yeah, yeah, I think in my head. I heard that you live 80 miles away from the farm
[07:29.890 --> 07:36.450]  No, I I'm it's like 80 acres away. There's two parcel two because they're all 40 the farms of 40 acre parcel
[07:38.210 --> 07:40.450]  Which I think of an acres like a square mile
[07:42.330 --> 07:47.710]  Um
[07:47.910 --> 07:49.910]  Yes, we're in Eastern
[07:50.590 --> 07:53.070]  Back to our early conversation, huh?
[07:54.670 --> 07:58.470]  That's right adults say there although I I used to hate pooping
[07:59.390 --> 08:04.870]  You know like especially you'd like walk out of the bathroom and some girl would like have to walk into the bathroom
[08:05.510 --> 08:07.510]  You like I'm so sorry
[08:08.110 --> 08:14.470]  All right, you know I'll be like the kids some of the kids they want like privacy and then when I'm pooping
[08:14.710 --> 08:17.070]  I'd like two kids a cat on my back
[08:17.230 --> 08:23.930]  You know just like staring at me and my wife my wife and my kids will just come in and I'll be like
[08:24.910 --> 08:26.910]  Serenity now
[08:30.750 --> 08:36.630]  All right, so the 80 acre two parcels which you only live a couple minutes away from
[08:36.630 --> 08:38.630]  You
[08:39.110 --> 08:46.070]  Used to live in a yurt and now you obviously have some working lights behind you and an internet connection
[08:47.270 --> 08:53.950]  Yeah, barely internet connection, but it works. You know I'm the hot spotting from the phone, so this is the first time
[08:53.950 --> 08:56.590]  I've attempted to stream with it Wow
[08:57.230 --> 09:00.150]  You know we might sign up for Starlink, but it's a
[09:01.390 --> 09:03.390]  We're enjoying no Wi-Fi for now
[09:03.910 --> 09:06.590]  But then again, I haven't had to do any of these yet
[09:08.270 --> 09:14.220]  Yeah, and we're so we're Eastern Minnesota County kind of in I guess the middle
[09:15.700 --> 09:20.340]  And Potter Valley so we're next to like Redwood Valley is the valley over from us
[09:20.340 --> 09:23.220]  And then if you were to go like north a good ways
[09:23.740 --> 09:25.740]  you'd end up in Kovalo and
[09:26.580 --> 09:28.980]  There are some pretty cool roads to do that
[09:31.780 --> 09:33.780]  Yeah, and it's just
[09:35.060 --> 09:37.140]  It's the the family farm and
[09:38.220 --> 09:42.060]  It's it's really a nice little micro climate
[09:42.700 --> 09:46.900]  That's like a Luther Burbank settled in Sonoma County because all the different
[09:47.500 --> 09:50.540]  Microclimate it's like the difference between the hills and the valleys and the slopes
[09:50.540 --> 09:56.340]  It's really fun to see that play out with a ganja even on our own farm as we go from 23 to
[09:56.820 --> 10:02.060]  2500 feet in elevation, and you know we have the tree line and this and the sunny side
[10:03.060 --> 10:06.580]  You know the place that you know gets that last son of the season
[10:08.100 --> 10:10.220]  Can you talk a little bit about stuff?
[10:10.220 --> 10:15.820]  I mean what you're noticing about maybe even the same things growing just in those different
[10:16.660 --> 10:21.500]  Elevations and micro climates. Oh, you know someone I don't know where I heard it
[10:21.500 --> 10:26.980]  But someone said like the environment can be like 50% of the expression
[10:27.940 --> 10:32.580]  And I saw that for sure with like my my love laughter my high CBD
[10:32.580 --> 10:35.500]  Which is it's like an October front finisher
[10:35.500 --> 10:39.180]  And we tried growing it in one of the little gardens on the north slope
[10:39.180 --> 10:41.900]  And I couldn't even I was like this is a different strain
[10:41.900 --> 10:46.700]  And then we you know grew it back up with the Sun again on a different location
[10:46.700 --> 10:51.780]  it looked the same so it was they're really interesting to see that play out and
[10:52.500 --> 10:57.340]  So like what we're about to harvest is my early Sphinx og and
[10:58.500 --> 11:00.500]  So those are on the tree line on
[11:01.580 --> 11:03.580]  the Northwest slopes so
[11:04.580 --> 11:06.060]  You kind of got to figure out
[11:06.060 --> 11:11.500]  It's kind of fun to play around with and find out what really thrives well in a certain location of the different
[11:11.620 --> 11:13.620]  cultivars you're growing and
[11:13.860 --> 11:18.420]  And then you know a lot of our nursery spaces. It's like okay
[11:18.420 --> 11:24.140]  I got a plant the stuff that's gonna get seeded later here where the Sun's gonna help it finish
[11:25.140 --> 11:27.980]  But there are some some ways around that like the sprouted
[11:28.500 --> 11:30.140]  tea
[11:30.140 --> 11:35.660]  smoothies where you do like the barley or any seeds and you sprout them and and then you mix a
[11:36.460 --> 11:41.460]  That in with like a five gallon bucket of water that that helps the seed moms finish earlier
[11:43.540 --> 11:45.140]  So yeah, just
[11:45.140 --> 11:46.460]  kind of
[11:46.460 --> 11:50.420]  Playing around with this little piece of land and you know growing some
[11:51.540 --> 11:53.980]  Really nice ganja and making a bunch of seeds
[12:00.010 --> 12:02.010]  How has the season
[12:08.220 --> 12:11.420]  It's it's been an interesting one as far as the weather
[12:12.660 --> 12:14.660]  we had
[12:15.660 --> 12:18.100]  12 overcast days in July and
[12:18.740 --> 12:22.780]  You know we're inland Minnesota County that doesn't I've never seen that happen before
[12:24.420 --> 12:26.420]  So I know like, you know
[12:27.020 --> 12:30.460]  We were not growing clones. So it's like less affecting us
[12:30.460 --> 12:36.660]  Maybe some stuff triggered flower early anyway with the seeds, but I know people going crown clones triggered early
[12:37.180 --> 12:39.660]  Normally you put your clones out middle of June you're good
[12:39.660 --> 12:45.220]  But you know two weeks of cloudy weather in July is unheard of and we it rained on the 4th of July
[12:45.220 --> 12:47.220]  We had we had a really wet
[12:47.380 --> 12:50.140]  Spring and summer one of the wettest I can remember
[12:51.140 --> 12:57.900]  Which was nice because last summer was brutal last summer was triple-digit heatwave one after the other
[13:02.780 --> 13:10.220]  Rain that you guys got early or early summer late spring is gonna help keep the fires at bay. Oh, I mean
[13:11.820 --> 13:19.460]  Consider you know, what is it like almost September, you know considering fire season rolls through October these years, you know it
[13:20.460 --> 13:27.860]  Usually the late people say the late seat rains the grass grows more so there's more of a risk for fire see but
[13:28.740 --> 13:32.220]  It definitely added a couple more layers of the chop and chop
[13:33.140 --> 13:35.140]  cover
[13:36.060 --> 13:41.380]  Crop
[13:41.900 --> 13:45.820]  It was he choppy for you too or was I can't tell if it's my internet or
[13:49.780 --> 13:51.780]  Little bit so
[13:52.020 --> 13:53.540]  I
[13:53.540 --> 13:57.780]  Walked away. I walked away before because when you mentioned love laughter
[14:00.780 --> 14:02.780]  Somebody sent me
[14:03.580 --> 14:09.780]  To give out to people a love laughter blue dream cross that they made
[14:10.580 --> 14:12.580]  Okay
[14:13.340 --> 14:15.340]  Which is cool and
[14:16.580 --> 14:18.580]  And
[14:19.060 --> 14:21.060]  Can you talk about the love laughter
[14:23.540 --> 14:25.340]  Yeah
[14:25.340 --> 14:29.860]  And kind of this gets to like you're exploring like a variety of stuff. It's like
[14:30.860 --> 14:36.380]  CBD or like other cannabinoids and not like like you have a breadth of
[14:37.340 --> 14:41.100]  Directions you breathe in which is kind of interesting you do a lot of stuff
[14:41.900 --> 14:43.900]  Yeah
[14:44.900 --> 14:49.820]  I'm a bit of a mad scientist. I guess in that in that respect and it's just
[14:50.100 --> 14:53.620]  You know something but I like to listen to the plants to you know
[14:53.620 --> 14:59.220]  sometimes you have an idea of you what you want to do and sometimes the plant kind of speaks to you and then
[14:59.540 --> 15:02.460]  When all else fails just chuck pollen everywhere, you know
[15:04.980 --> 15:06.980]  So the love laughter
[15:08.820 --> 15:14.500]  I've gotten a pack of I think Linney's laughter
[15:15.980 --> 15:17.980]  From the Emerald Cup and like
[15:17.980 --> 15:23.260]  I don't know like 2016 from Oregon CBD company and
[15:24.980 --> 15:28.940]  The Linney's laughter is like Lucy's lion with
[15:30.500 --> 15:35.500]  One of the like original maybe like Charlotte's web or something I'd have to look that back up
[15:35.500 --> 15:37.620]  But I think you can find some information on what?
[15:38.500 --> 15:39.820]  Lucy's
[15:39.820 --> 15:42.060]  Lion was and then ladies laughter was
[15:42.180 --> 15:44.420]  Lying was and then ladies laughter was
[15:44.940 --> 15:49.580]  Named after a girl in Southern Oregon or not. I don't know said that somewhere in Oregon
[15:50.100 --> 15:52.100]  And so I took a really nice male
[15:52.620 --> 15:54.620]  really strong
[15:55.860 --> 16:03.140]  Terpene like stock rub coming off that and then my sister-in-law had gotten a Valentine's clone
[16:03.740 --> 16:07.140]  from a medicine-making workshop she did in Booneville and
[16:07.820 --> 16:09.660]  Valentine I
[16:09.660 --> 16:13.580]  Believe it was a AC DC. You know, hunts a clone only strain and
[16:14.300 --> 16:16.100]  I
[16:16.100 --> 16:22.220]  Thought laughing Valentine kind of sound like a bad date. So I went with love laughter, which
[16:23.420 --> 16:25.540]  is a much better name and it's
[16:26.100 --> 16:31.460]  The the terpenes coming off that are like eucalyptus and berry and it has like a really nice flavor
[16:31.740 --> 16:39.340]  So it's a 20 to 1 it's like 0.8 percent THC and a lot of those really high CBD strains don't have like the best flavor
[16:39.660 --> 16:43.060]  This one has a really nice like flavor and terpene profile
[16:48.840 --> 16:52.920]  Yeah, there was a question I had earlier that I just totally forgot but uh
[16:53.960 --> 16:57.320]  It'll come back to me. But it's the kid. It's the kids
[16:59.960 --> 17:01.960]  It's the weed right now, but uh
[17:03.360 --> 17:05.360]  As I forgot the question
[17:05.360 --> 17:11.280]  I was like I should start writing questions down when I think of them because I'm definitely gonna forget them. But uh
[17:11.960 --> 17:16.080]  We were taught and we're before we were talking about the microclimates and
[17:18.720 --> 17:21.880]  But there was something right before that that I had a question about
[17:26.370 --> 17:28.370]  It was
[17:28.530 --> 17:32.890]  Well, anyway going back to the microclimates so you notice that that
[17:36.030 --> 17:39.390]  Like sorry, my questions was around
[17:41.870 --> 17:43.870]  Like
[17:44.150 --> 17:46.150]  How much did you source
[17:47.030 --> 17:49.310]  seeds and clones like
[17:49.790 --> 17:57.090]  between your dad from the 70s and up to now and like trading and being open with like friends and neighbor or like
[17:58.550 --> 18:03.450]  Like you're probably dealing with more people now than you guys were in the 80s, right?
[18:03.450 --> 18:06.810]  Like you're more open like other people are more open
[18:06.810 --> 18:11.670]  so can you talk about kind of in the community how people were sharing and and
[18:11.830 --> 18:17.710]  Like learning about new and different things from each other and how that's progressed over the years
[18:18.550 --> 18:22.610]  So from like the 80s up until kind of current times
[18:24.230 --> 18:26.230]  Yeah, I mean
[18:27.070 --> 18:29.070]  Guess we've always
[18:29.190 --> 18:31.190]  you know shared seeds with
[18:31.990 --> 18:35.830]  friends and that's like still goes on today and
[18:38.150 --> 18:40.710]  You know, I haven't really
[18:42.390 --> 18:45.310]  Haven't paid for very many packs of seeds in my life
[18:47.670 --> 18:52.190]  And then it's nice that you have friends that are doing breed and work to like
[18:53.110 --> 18:57.350]  You know, like I think in my post I did today, you know, I go to you know, see like
[18:58.150 --> 18:59.790]  golden figs and
[18:59.790 --> 19:04.190]  Covillot and the winner and you know do a little seed trade and
[19:05.190 --> 19:07.510]  And now it's getting to the point where
[19:08.070 --> 19:12.350]  It's almost just it's too much. I have too much too many seed lots too many. It's
[19:13.870 --> 19:17.950]  I have no it's out of hand. It's someone should stop me
[19:21.350 --> 19:24.750]  Well, what's in traveling
[19:26.110 --> 19:30.870]  You've also brought a lot of stuff to like multiple generations out, right
[19:32.070 --> 19:34.070]  Yeah, I mean
[19:34.910 --> 19:36.550]  Yeah
[19:36.550 --> 19:38.550]  Yeah, you know and that's
[19:39.070 --> 19:42.710]  So like you're doing a lot of stuff, but you're also doing a lot of stuff deeply
[19:43.510 --> 19:46.190]  Well, and then you know doing because pollen
[19:46.990 --> 19:51.710]  Collections hard work and very delicate work and tedious work. So it's nice
[19:52.070 --> 19:57.430]  You know, I have some specific goals with line breeding, but then I've collected all this pollen. So
[19:58.710 --> 20:01.830]  make a bunch of you know polyhybrids too because
[20:02.830 --> 20:07.830]  You know, I've done a really hard job of collecting all this pollen
[20:08.830 --> 20:09.910]  so
[20:09.910 --> 20:17.230]  you know sometimes I'll every couple years just get a you know round up some clones from the homies that guts and
[20:17.910 --> 20:19.910]  put Paul, you know
[20:20.110 --> 20:22.110]  Frozen pollen too doesn't last very long
[20:22.630 --> 20:26.150]  You know, but you can at least get another season out of it
[20:26.790 --> 20:28.790]  If you had I think if you had a deep freezer
[20:29.750 --> 20:36.070]  You could get it to last longer but just in the household freezer you it extends to the shelf life of pollen maybe a year or
[20:36.070 --> 20:36.950]  two
[20:36.950 --> 20:38.470]  If you're lucky
[20:38.470 --> 20:40.550]  There's no like, you know power outs are
[20:41.310 --> 20:43.870]  Cuz as soon as it thaws it's toast
[20:44.590 --> 20:46.590]  But if you keep it frozen
[20:48.430 --> 20:52.830]  Like it wouldn't last many years I mean
[20:52.830 --> 20:57.750]  Not and I think you're like kitchen freezer got it. I think you need a little
[20:59.190 --> 21:06.030]  But I haven't I've been able to keep pollen going for like two years something always happen like PG&E blackouts or something something always happens
[21:08.150 --> 21:10.150]  Fires yeah, yeah earthquakes
[21:12.230 --> 21:18.110]  But it's nice to get at least even another another season out of it, you know makes it that hard work of pollen collection
[21:18.230 --> 21:20.230]  Because I guess it's I
[21:21.110 --> 21:23.710]  Mean I have sold pollen in the in the past
[21:25.630 --> 21:31.750]  I usually don't do that. I think a lot of people would buy that pollen. I
[21:33.110 --> 21:36.910]  Know that you know times are tough. I was thinking about maybe doing a sale
[21:41.230 --> 21:44.710]  That's what I'm doing right now on the farm is a lot of pollen
[21:44.830 --> 21:48.870]  That's what I'm doing right now on the farm is a lot of pollen collection and
[21:50.070 --> 21:56.070]  Like what what kind of this year? Have you been collecting pollen? Like what's exciting you that you want to?
[21:57.070 --> 21:59.070]  Let's say let's take a look
[21:59.830 --> 22:01.830]  It's show-and-tell time
[22:02.350 --> 22:06.630]  Yeah, I mean Travis you came back just in time for show-and-tell
[22:07.310 --> 22:14.630]  Yeah, I got some banana jam f3 from moon gazers farm that I'm really excited to make a couple crosses with this
[22:14.630 --> 22:16.630]  I'm gonna cross it to my strawberry collie
[22:19.430 --> 22:21.430]  You know, I've got
[22:22.910 --> 22:24.910]  Yeah
[22:25.670 --> 22:26.950]  Well
[22:26.950 --> 22:28.870]  We'll see
[22:28.870 --> 22:32.950]  And then I have that hash. I got a cherry lotus from green source
[22:32.950 --> 22:37.310]  which is supposed to be a good hasher and I want to cross that with the
[22:37.990 --> 22:43.030]  Lemonhead skittles I got for the you know, it's cherry lemon skittles because those are good hashers
[22:44.710 --> 22:49.550]  Who I got I got some turban poison pollen right here excited for that
[22:50.950 --> 22:52.550]  I
[22:52.550 --> 22:54.470]  Don't even I don't remember
[22:54.470 --> 22:58.750]  So if you're watching and you gave me German poison seeds there from you
[23:01.750 --> 23:07.030]  And then I just put that haze mail into my pollen collection box and
[23:08.190 --> 23:10.190]  We are gonna be shooting a video
[23:10.870 --> 23:14.230]  of the you know, the mail garden the
[23:14.750 --> 23:18.270]  Whole pollen collection process. How's Evan doing? By the way?
[23:18.830 --> 23:22.230]  He's good. Yeah, is he a good understudy? I
[23:23.030 --> 23:25.030]  mean, it's perfect
[23:26.350 --> 23:28.350]  because
[23:28.550 --> 23:31.350]  We have a film school graduate living on the farm and
[23:32.070 --> 23:35.270]  This is you know, we just on the farm. He's helping on the farm
[23:35.270 --> 23:41.790]  Yeah, and it's that's you know, the content that people want for a brand, you know, it's it's just
[23:42.750 --> 23:44.550]  I
[23:44.550 --> 23:51.230]  Was like finally this is like what I've wanted to do for like eight years and I'm like stuck at home with little kids
[23:51.230 --> 23:58.830]  And I like if I didn't have kids I'd be like in a Winnebago going from farm to farm all summer just filming shit
[23:59.750 --> 24:03.310]  And then I'm like, but I have kids so I'm not gonna do any of that
[24:04.670 --> 24:07.770]  and I'm excited for my blue thunder f4 pollen because
[24:08.450 --> 24:13.410]  Last year it I wasn't able to collect it that something happened with the mail
[24:13.410 --> 24:16.410]  I selected but this one was a really nice mail and
[24:18.610 --> 24:22.950]  Just for the namesake I'm gonna cross that in with the cherry lotus for blue lotus
[24:27.680 --> 24:31.240]  But yeah, this is I'll be I'll start to paint the seeds
[24:32.320 --> 24:35.720]  See, I already made one because one cross so far
[24:35.800 --> 24:41.120]  That was the early Sphinx because you know, we're gonna start harvesting those before this this like this
[24:41.120 --> 24:43.380]  I don't know. What day is it next couple of days?
[24:44.280 --> 24:47.320]  and
[24:47.320 --> 24:51.080]  That that's one of the autos, right? No, it's a full term. Oh
[24:51.760 --> 24:55.520]  Really? Yeah, but it's the lion claw
[24:56.280 --> 24:58.280]  crossed in with a lemon head
[24:58.400 --> 25:00.400]  but
[25:00.520 --> 25:03.780]  In the second generation we selected the
[25:04.100 --> 25:08.180]  Photo sensitive traits not the auto flower traits so you can you can go both ways
[25:09.260 --> 25:11.500]  When you cross an auto in with a full term
[25:12.260 --> 25:14.260]  And that you can
[25:14.540 --> 25:16.540]  Shave a few weeks
[25:18.220 --> 25:24.860]  So it makes it's making it faster flowering which is why it's flowering right now well you can help yeah you can
[25:26.180 --> 25:30.180]  You can select for that trade. It can also just make it normal flowering time
[25:30.380 --> 25:34.220]  You know won't shave any time off of it unless you select for it
[25:35.660 --> 25:41.700]  Because like half the phenos of the of the early Sphinx are gonna be ready in October at the f3 stage
[25:42.980 --> 25:44.980]  and those have a
[25:45.260 --> 25:53.420]  Totally different chirping profile. The later ones are like gas and candy peaches. It's it's actually a really amazing
[25:54.900 --> 25:56.380]  Profile
[25:56.380 --> 26:00.700]  Well, so someone asked do you test for it like are you oh
[26:04.540 --> 26:07.020]  Testing or like lab testing or
[26:09.020 --> 26:15.540]  Just no is testing for now, you know, we do send stuff off to the lab, but it's not like
[26:17.300 --> 26:23.100]  You know my older brother who is no longer amongst us, you know, he said that
[26:24.100 --> 26:27.060]  The nose is one of the easiest things to breed for
[26:28.300 --> 26:30.820]  And I think it's because you can if you have
[26:31.740 --> 26:35.900]  Enough males to look through you can find a male that has a good nose on it
[26:35.900 --> 26:39.140]  And then you put that on a female with a good nose on and there you go
[26:45.540 --> 26:51.460]  But what yeah, what's interesting to like with the the sour afghan which started off as like a
[26:52.540 --> 26:54.540]  More sativa, but I started selecting
[26:54.940 --> 26:59.300]  Just the know they're in the second generation of inbreeding it I
[26:59.980 --> 27:02.780]  Came across the Jade skunk, you know
[27:02.780 --> 27:06.020]  Which was smelled like what my dad and brother were growing 20 years ago
[27:06.380 --> 27:09.260]  And now from breeding that just from the nose of that
[27:09.260 --> 27:15.620]  It's like altered the high and the sativa high to the more like relaxing indica high of like the afghan
[27:16.100 --> 27:18.420]  That they were indica from back in the day
[27:19.140 --> 27:21.140]  So that was a fun
[27:21.140 --> 27:23.140]  little process
[27:23.140 --> 27:25.140]  Little process
[27:27.710 --> 27:29.710]  They were
[27:33.150 --> 27:35.150]  Always talking to the kid the cat
[27:36.830 --> 27:41.750]  Have you heard anything about the honey bananas genetics floating around your neck of the woods
[27:42.630 --> 27:44.870]  No, honey banana. Haven't heard a honey banana
[27:49.530 --> 27:54.290]  Okay, I'll keep my ears out now I don't know much is why I ask and I I
[27:54.890 --> 27:58.930]  Don't have much to report back myself except that it's supposed to be very very tasty
[28:01.370 --> 28:06.890]  Yeah, I do love the banana turps when they come when they come out
[28:08.290 --> 28:10.870]  We have a banana Jack we're working on that
[28:11.930 --> 28:17.890]  You know has that like sweet banana flavor and then like the real pining of the Jack comes out in the cure
[28:27.490 --> 28:32.440]  I
[28:32.440 --> 28:36.440]  Mean I haven't really grown too much from clone ever but I have heard of
[28:36.960 --> 28:40.560]  The the snow and seen some work that people have done with the snow
[28:57.650 --> 28:59.770]  And then do you see that so
[29:01.770 --> 29:03.770]  So I've been giving the
[29:04.810 --> 29:10.090]  Like the light the light so you sent me a ton of Lions Claw auto or a lion claw auto
[29:10.090 --> 29:14.250]  And I've just been get like everybody. I've just been giving it to
[29:14.850 --> 29:18.330]  Yeah, like getting feedback people be like I'm growing it
[29:19.330 --> 29:26.370]  yeah, like that's definitely one that like people find me by to though, but like oh my neighbor gave me some line class seeds and
[29:27.290 --> 29:29.290]  It was amazing
[29:30.170 --> 29:32.170]  So, yeah, that's
[29:32.570 --> 29:38.250]  That's a fun one. Okay. Can you talk about that? Like what was the the
[29:39.810 --> 29:41.890]  Photo that you worked with
[29:42.850 --> 29:46.770]  Yeah, so the Lion Claw came into my possession I
[29:48.690 --> 29:50.690]  Don't know maybe like a
[29:50.730 --> 29:53.370]  Decade ago almost now or long. I don't know and
[29:54.290 --> 29:57.930]  But my friend had built a Jim Bay drum for this
[30:00.170 --> 30:04.570]  Grower on the coast and he gave him like three packs of seeds and
[30:05.130 --> 30:09.330]  some cash for the drum and one of them was just labeled early girl and
[30:10.170 --> 30:15.170]  Like we grew the the seeds out and then they were open pollinating in
[30:16.410 --> 30:23.450]  my nursery before I realized what was going on and he and then later I found out like the the story because I
[30:24.090 --> 30:30.250]  Ended up meeting someone else who knew him. Apparently he doesn't even grow anymore. I guess a lot of people don't but
[30:31.650 --> 30:35.810]  he was just he crossed a Mexican early girl with a
[30:36.530 --> 30:42.170]  Lionsgate OG cut and just kept selecting the earliest flowering ones
[30:44.570 --> 30:53.130]  Unknowingly, you know breeding out a recessant trait of root or alias and would you know the Mexican early girl that then made it fully auto
[30:54.770 --> 30:58.330]  And I stabilized it for I
[30:59.570 --> 31:03.450]  Don't know five or six generations from what I got it from
[31:04.450 --> 31:10.970]  I'm not even sure what what gen it was but at least at least third gen to make it fully auto like that and
[31:12.170 --> 31:14.170]  Then that's been the kind of like the staple
[31:14.730 --> 31:20.050]  Auto flower for my auto breeding program and then gotten some other ones in seed trades
[31:20.930 --> 31:24.970]  And sometimes I get some in seed trains from you know, it's just like
[31:26.090 --> 31:29.050]  Breeder notes on it. Not even sure what they are
[31:29.210 --> 31:31.210]  Is there like
[31:32.410 --> 31:34.410]  Are you breeding auto like
[31:34.930 --> 31:39.450]  Something that's yours. That's auto flower with something that someone else's that's auto flower
[31:39.450 --> 31:45.650]  Are you breeding auto flower to something photo period and then trying to bring the auto flower traits back or?
[31:46.090 --> 31:50.650]  I'm doing both because the lion claws a hundred day auto and
[31:51.330 --> 31:56.050]  Then a lot of the other autos I get are the you know, 60 to 75 day
[31:56.170 --> 31:59.330]  But I did a huge that's just quickly that's good
[31:59.330 --> 32:04.530]  You said that cuz I get asked that question all the time like how long does it take to flower and I'm always like
[32:05.170 --> 32:12.570]  And I always like I think 90 is my guess cuz I totally forgot so a hundred is that the answer?
[32:13.090 --> 32:16.330]  Yes, oh, but autos so autos are not
[32:17.010 --> 32:21.410]  For the lion claw. Yeah for the line club autos in general. They're they're a hundred
[32:21.410 --> 32:26.130]  Not for the lion claw. Yeah for the line club autos in general. They're
[32:27.890 --> 32:29.770]  Not photo
[32:29.770 --> 32:32.810]  Dependent but they are photo influenced and weather influence
[32:32.810 --> 32:38.850]  So if it's colder and and wetter they're gonna go longer and if it's hotter and more sunshine
[32:38.850 --> 32:42.190]  They'll go shorter like our summer run of the lion claw goes 90 days
[32:43.290 --> 32:45.290]  whereas the early spring run will be like a
[32:46.810 --> 32:50.170]  110 and then when I do my like late season
[32:51.890 --> 32:53.890]  Usually for seed it takes them
[32:54.570 --> 32:59.610]  Like 125 days to mature, but it's like, you know, I'm harvesting those in December
[32:59.610 --> 33:05.770]  Is that because in their native environment where it gets cold fast and you better finish?
[33:06.410 --> 33:07.690]  like
[33:07.690 --> 33:14.490]  They're judging the hot days as like shit. This is about to end. So I need to like finish up. Oh, maybe yeah
[33:14.490 --> 33:16.490]  I mean, they're definitely influenced by the
[33:16.930 --> 33:18.930]  The weather and and
[33:19.250 --> 33:21.690]  autos will do I've seen them do weird things like
[33:22.210 --> 33:25.930]  my early spring runs before when they then you get a heatwave and they're like
[33:26.210 --> 33:29.530]  Some of them will even like revenge and then flower again
[33:30.370 --> 33:32.690]  Yeah, they just they do weird stuff
[33:33.610 --> 33:34.610]  like
[33:34.610 --> 33:36.610]  flower under 24 hours of light
[33:37.630 --> 33:39.630]  Which is cool
[33:41.610 --> 33:44.970]  Any interesting observations for autos and winter runs
[33:45.970 --> 33:47.970]  Yeah, I mean
[33:48.330 --> 33:54.170]  Against like cold weather and humidity XYZ. Oh, yeah, cuz I've done some late season
[33:54.730 --> 33:57.770]  breeding hoops with clones and autos and like let them
[33:58.010 --> 34:02.970]  pollinate I did one and you can tell which ones are the clones and which ones are the autos because the clones are like
[34:02.970 --> 34:04.610]  Oh help
[34:04.610 --> 34:09.570]  You know, they're like barely buds and the autos are like, oh those the autos are the nugs in there
[34:10.570 --> 34:12.570]  And
[34:12.570 --> 34:18.290]  They really of course because it's like colder and the sun's less intense. They definitely like a nice
[34:19.010 --> 34:23.930]  And they get that it would be a good hash run like you if you were to grow like, you know
[34:24.450 --> 34:28.970]  In a climate where you could pull off a late-season auto run for hash. I'm sure it would make really good hash
[34:30.090 --> 34:37.130]  Where you live does it freeze at all like in LA I never worry about
[34:37.130 --> 34:41.650]  It even dipping the freezing so like all year I'm growing
[34:42.650 --> 34:46.930]  And never like stressing about it's just like obviously it'll be different but like
[34:48.330 --> 34:53.330]  Can you grow all winter or like are you in a greenhouse in the winter?
[34:54.250 --> 34:56.250]  No, I mean at all
[34:57.690 --> 35:03.610]  Yeah, and that's kind of as like an outdoor farm you kind of want that winter reset to like I wouldn't want to be
[35:03.610 --> 35:07.530]  But in that without assisting with heat I
[35:08.770 --> 35:14.850]  Couldn't grow in a greenhouse all winter and then and then sometimes because I but I I have I do like to do
[35:16.130 --> 35:22.410]  Like I start some auto seeds in August to grow in a greenhouse for seeds and are and they'll finish up
[35:22.410 --> 35:25.410]  You know in December and sometimes we get a hard frost
[35:26.930 --> 35:28.930]  Early in December
[35:29.050 --> 35:32.010]  Sometimes it's later and this is like in December
[35:32.090 --> 35:35.690]  It just depends on the wind then on a hard frost night. I will turn on a heater
[35:36.570 --> 35:38.570]  because
[35:39.130 --> 35:42.650]  It would it would kill them in a greenhouse
[35:43.530 --> 35:45.530]  And that's like, you know where it's
[35:46.170 --> 35:49.010]  Our hard freeze so that's 20 degrees
[35:51.530 --> 35:57.290]  And that's about as cold as it gets in a normal winter here so that's like 12 below
[35:57.410 --> 35:59.410]  Freezing
[35:59.410 --> 36:03.730]  Yeah, I went from New England to Southern, California
[36:09.050 --> 36:13.410]  Oh, yeah, I mean it's northern California winters are still pretty nice like
[36:15.170 --> 36:17.170]  You know
[36:17.210 --> 36:22.410]  It's like a lightweight winter. Yeah. I mean I wear shorts and flip-flops all winter
[36:23.370 --> 36:27.930]  But people look at me funny. I'm like, oh, yeah, I'm a little bit of a flipper
[36:27.930 --> 36:35.530]  Yeah, I mean I wear shorts and flip-flops all winter but people look at me funny sometimes, you know, uh,
[36:37.050 --> 36:39.050]  Yeah
[36:39.050 --> 36:42.650]  That's funny because in Maine we wear flannels and wool hats even in August
[36:46.250 --> 36:48.250]  Yeah, I
[36:48.970 --> 36:53.210]  Mean are you looking forward to this winter up in Maine?
[36:53.450 --> 36:56.570]  Snowmobiling is what darkness darkness at 430
[36:57.450 --> 37:02.650]  Snowmobiling is one of my favorite activities and usually it's the slow season for growing so they go hand in hand
[37:02.650 --> 37:06.370]  And that's just when I start having fun. So I love when the days start getting short
[37:07.530 --> 37:09.530]  I'm also looking forward to winter
[37:13.120 --> 37:18.120]  That's the weekend so on the farm side of things
[37:19.640 --> 37:21.200]  Are you
[37:21.200 --> 37:25.440]  Like what's the scale of what you're growing and how's it going like
[37:26.320 --> 37:29.500]  How's the California regulated market treating you?
[37:30.920 --> 37:32.920]  Tell us about it
[37:34.240 --> 37:36.240]  We're
[37:38.160 --> 37:46.320]  10,000 square foot of cultivation and we you know, we grow large outdoor plants with lots of spacing and room, you know for
[37:47.680 --> 37:49.680]  permaculture and polyculture in between
[37:51.200 --> 37:54.320]  And then we have a 5 000 square foot nursery. I don't think we're
[37:55.680 --> 37:57.680]  quite at that and
[37:58.240 --> 38:00.240]  You know, the droughts have been hard on us
[38:01.120 --> 38:03.120]  um
[38:03.200 --> 38:05.200]  And
[38:05.680 --> 38:10.160]  You know, it's hard it's been a hard year to sell above the cost of production
[38:10.480 --> 38:13.840]  So that kind of makes hiring like any real labor
[38:14.800 --> 38:16.800]  uh
[38:16.800 --> 38:19.520]  So it's been a shoestring string year so
[38:19.600 --> 38:22.160]  We've scaled back a little bit and if things
[38:23.040 --> 38:28.000]  Continue to in this trend. We'll just keep scaling back till it's profitable and and focusing on the uh,
[38:28.000 --> 38:30.000]  the seeds and the genetics and
[38:31.120 --> 38:33.120]  And the whole
[38:33.360 --> 38:36.160]  Regulatory thing, you know, it's I don't think
[38:37.440 --> 38:39.440]  They want us to succeed
[38:40.560 --> 38:44.080]  Because it wouldn't it wouldn't it wouldn't be a frame like it is
[38:45.040 --> 38:47.920]  No one watching would disagree with that statement
[38:48.000 --> 38:50.000]  um and
[38:50.560 --> 38:54.080]  I don't know. We just had a code enforcement out to the farm
[38:54.880 --> 38:58.800]  So we're supposed to have like a county planner that would help us with like, you know
[38:58.800 --> 39:00.800]  We've been in the program for five years
[39:01.280 --> 39:05.920]  And then you know someone does the complaint on the farm and we have code enforcement now instead
[39:05.920 --> 39:09.680]  And now we have 30 days to fix a bunch of stuff that we should have had like someone help us
[39:09.840 --> 39:11.840]  Work on over the years, you know
[39:12.720 --> 39:16.320]  So you're like we're begging you to help set us up for success
[39:16.400 --> 39:19.680]  You're right and then they like punish you for not
[39:20.460 --> 39:22.560]  Understanding what exactly you need to do
[39:23.200 --> 39:24.880]  on certain things
[39:24.880 --> 39:29.040]  It's just this form of capitalism too. It just doesn't seem to be working out
[39:29.600 --> 39:33.520]  I think it might even be over. It's just we have all haven't realized it yet
[39:35.040 --> 39:36.640]  I think you know
[39:36.640 --> 39:41.280]  I think it's over with that being said. Have you been growing a lot more vegetables this season?
[39:42.240 --> 39:45.200]  You know, um, I've been growing a lot more vegetables
[39:45.280 --> 39:47.280]  you know, um
[39:47.680 --> 39:54.320]  Not a bump a year for veggies for us because we moved into a new house in may and had another baby and I just didn't
[39:55.440 --> 39:58.560]  Have a lot, you know, like the nursery is smaller this year
[39:59.360 --> 40:02.640]  So everything's kind of scaled back, but I look forward to um
[40:03.280 --> 40:05.280]  doing a lot of prep this winter to
[40:06.400 --> 40:11.760]  I I was about to say I look forward to when my kids are old enough that they can help me do my shit
[40:11.760 --> 40:14.640]  Whereas right now they're like they're like
[40:15.760 --> 40:17.760]  We need attention. You're like ah shit
[40:18.640 --> 40:20.640]  Yeah
[40:20.640 --> 40:26.720]  Yeah, I mean I have a the what six two and a half in six months. So it's it's a tight spread. Yeah
[40:27.760 --> 40:29.760]  It's grueling
[40:32.400 --> 40:35.840]  But uh, it's interesting, I mean it's like
[40:36.560 --> 40:43.200]  Talking about different income streams and ways to survive it's like the seed side of things. Yeah, the
[40:44.160 --> 40:46.960]  the traditional farming side of things like
[40:48.160 --> 40:56.160]  The second revenue stream like Casey Casey does a ton of that, right? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Um,
[40:57.760 --> 40:59.760]  Yeah, he has a um
[41:01.280 --> 41:03.680]  I love his post too on facebook and
[41:03.920 --> 41:09.920]  Instagram, um, he was just talking about winter too. This is the dog days of august, you know, this is the the girl
[41:10.560 --> 41:15.520]  Um, but yeah, they do a big market. They do a big market garden. They do a lot of foods and and I think
[41:16.560 --> 41:21.600]  Where he's at they're doing 2,500 square foot and then where his brother has the next door
[41:21.600 --> 41:24.640]  I think they're under well under 10k maybe
[41:25.360 --> 41:27.360]  7,500 square feet
[41:27.360 --> 41:29.760]  um, and yeah, and then you see like him and his
[41:29.840 --> 41:36.080]  Brother and his dad sitting around the table trimming it all too, you know, it's they're definitely a really inspiring cottage industry
[41:36.640 --> 41:38.640]  and but you know
[41:38.640 --> 41:41.680]  Very inspiring farm. Yeah, it sucks because
[41:42.880 --> 41:48.800]  Like all you guys are the people whose weed if anybody is weed should be smoked like grown by
[41:49.360 --> 41:52.960]  Someone should be smoked. It should be all of you guys and uh
[41:54.400 --> 41:56.400]  It it sucks kind of the
[41:56.480 --> 42:02.160]  Where you are where all of you like the most talented are like I may just walk away from this
[42:03.280 --> 42:07.760]  Well, and it's like that, you know, the regenerative sun-grown cannabis really is the best
[42:08.880 --> 42:12.960]  You know, but I think more people drink bud light in america
[42:14.240 --> 42:16.240]  than craft beer
[42:17.360 --> 42:20.080]  And we don't grow bud light. Do you see that?
[42:20.880 --> 42:22.880]  Yes, we don't
[42:22.880 --> 42:28.480]  Grow bud light. Do you see that? Yes. We are a part of the menacingos producers guild
[42:29.600 --> 42:31.600]  um, but we haven't
[42:31.680 --> 42:33.360]  we're gonna have stuff
[42:33.360 --> 42:35.360]  in packaging this year, we kind of
[42:35.920 --> 42:40.800]  You know snuck by another year with bulk sales, but i'm that's one thing I shifted doing too like
[42:42.080 --> 42:45.440]  because in the changing of the industry, you know, we
[42:46.320 --> 42:49.600]  It was like grow a little bit for packaging and then a lot for bulk
[42:50.080 --> 42:51.440]  but
[42:51.440 --> 42:56.320]  No one's buying bulk anymore. So so by growing you mean your own brand? Yeah
[42:56.800 --> 43:00.960]  So we're growing I think 15 varieties this year instead of five varieties on the farm
[43:02.640 --> 43:07.840]  To in in hitting that 10 to town 10 to 20 pound batch per variety to
[43:08.720 --> 43:13.060]  You know try to get um more of a variety out there and into more dispensaries
[43:14.560 --> 43:18.240]  What what do you have to test every 50 pounds so it's like
[43:18.960 --> 43:20.800]  Well, that's what yeah
[43:20.800 --> 43:24.320]  You have to that's why people want to like just distro one of like larger
[43:24.940 --> 43:26.480]  batches
[43:26.480 --> 43:29.200]  but if you're gonna package 10 pounds
[43:30.720 --> 43:32.140]  It's
[43:32.140 --> 43:33.600]  profitable
[43:33.600 --> 43:38.800]  And it's worth it to pay for the testing. Yeah, because I because i've talked to people about like
[43:39.760 --> 43:42.880]  sometimes you'd love to just grow a little bit of something and like
[43:43.360 --> 43:46.320]  Explore it and see if there's like a demand for it
[43:46.400 --> 43:50.400]  But you have to grow enough to make it worthwhile to do the testing
[43:51.360 --> 43:57.840]  yeah, I mean if and really it's you know developing the relationship with you know retail or like the
[43:58.480 --> 44:03.360]  Mendoza producers guilt like these farmer markets that are now becoming available. So it's
[44:05.360 --> 44:11.920]  Yeah, it is an interesting dilemma to you know get your product to the market
[44:14.240 --> 44:18.960]  And educating the marketplace so sorry as those types of like
[44:19.580 --> 44:23.600]  Saturday afternoon, uh farmers markets
[44:24.880 --> 44:28.560]  Because like i've seen posts where it seems like you guys are doing more and more of those
[44:28.560 --> 44:33.600]  So is everybody kind of like holy shit I can do again what I did like eight years ago
[44:34.320 --> 44:36.480]  And when I was most happiest in life
[44:38.080 --> 44:42.800]  Yeah, I mean it is a a beautiful thing I don't think it's
[44:44.320 --> 44:47.760]  Not sure how it's like translating into like sales like if it's
[44:49.840 --> 44:55.920]  Uh enough yet, but it's still in the early stages of doing it in this now legal and regulated market
[44:58.960 --> 45:03.920]  What are some of the food groups of the 15, uh genetics that you're running on the farm this year
[45:04.320 --> 45:08.720]  And also if you're doing six personals, what are the food groups on the ones that you're going for yourself?
[45:10.640 --> 45:14.000]  Um, yeah, well the part of the
[45:15.920 --> 45:17.600]  I mean when
[45:17.600 --> 45:21.440]  Prop 64 passed. Um, I pushed my dad to go legal
[45:22.240 --> 45:28.080]  Because of the nursery license where we could flower out 5 000 square foot for seed production. So I do a lot of my
[45:28.720 --> 45:30.720]  Research and development in the nursery
[45:30.720 --> 45:33.840]  So then I find something that really does well in the nursery
[45:34.000 --> 45:37.440]  And then I move it over to the flower side or if I got a good feeling about something
[45:38.640 --> 45:40.080]  so
[45:40.080 --> 45:45.280]  A lot of this stuff just came from my own stuff. I hit up some friends too that have like good stuff
[45:45.360 --> 45:52.400]  So i'm growing a batch of like cherry lotus from green source garden i'm growing a batch of dozy cot from stay fly
[45:53.280 --> 45:54.720]  um
[45:54.720 --> 45:56.720]  I'm growing the haze
[45:56.800 --> 45:58.800]  pure haze from covolo
[45:59.520 --> 46:04.480]  Which my friend noah has like acclimated there to the valley floor and covola covolo
[46:04.480 --> 46:11.440]  So it's a november furnisher, which is amazing because the weather is extreme in covolo and the fall like season ending weather
[46:11.520 --> 46:13.520]  And it makes it there
[46:14.320 --> 46:17.520]  Um, i'm growing the you know, like durban poison
[46:18.320 --> 46:20.000]  and then I have
[46:20.000 --> 46:22.400]  The lemon head f3 which is like a willets
[46:22.960 --> 46:28.560]  Tahoe kim that i've been growing for a few years now, but like i'm breeding it down the generation
[46:28.560 --> 46:30.640]  So I got it as like a bat cross one
[46:31.760 --> 46:38.000]  And I don't know if you've grown like ogs out. There's still bottlenecks sometimes that like an f1 is really stable
[46:38.880 --> 46:40.880]  it's
[46:41.360 --> 46:43.840]  Some disliked so I have seen
[46:44.640 --> 46:47.120]  The bat cross one I was growing was pretty stable
[46:47.600 --> 46:52.800]  The f2 was pretty stable. That's how you know, it's bottlenecked if you make an f2 of it and it's like stable
[46:54.560 --> 46:56.080]  Um
[46:56.080 --> 46:59.200]  Oh and i'm growing um glazed cherries, which is also from
[46:59.920 --> 47:03.440]  Green source garden. I think i've made a generation on that and the coffee
[47:05.280 --> 47:09.540]  So, um, and then the sphinx og is a new one that i'm growing for production
[47:10.880 --> 47:13.360]  i'm growing healer from dragonfly earth medicine
[47:15.040 --> 47:17.040]  Um, so none of these were really like
[47:18.160 --> 47:20.160]  market demand because
[47:20.640 --> 47:23.360]  Market demands like well like runs and I don't even know
[47:23.920 --> 47:25.920]  You know say the healer is it?
[47:26.560 --> 47:28.560]  Everybody in la is asking for it
[47:30.240 --> 47:32.240]  I think yeah, no, that's a bummer. I mean
[47:33.280 --> 47:39.200]  Statistically the highest seller and uh, most of the west coast legal market. I think washington oregon and california
[47:39.200 --> 47:43.600]  I think it's blue dream and I can't remember the other one at the top sellers, but it would surprise you
[47:44.400 --> 47:48.800]  I mean it would surprise you if you grew it on your rec farm and tried to put it in the back too
[47:51.280 --> 47:54.160]  Um who how much
[47:55.840 --> 47:59.840]  How much haze are you growing I I guess my question is like
[48:01.680 --> 48:03.680]  It takes longer
[48:04.320 --> 48:05.360]  it
[48:05.360 --> 48:12.480]  Look, you know the yield it's like not like shelf like eye candy look like
[48:14.880 --> 48:20.320]  Is there a way to get consumers or enough consumers who value that and would pay more
[48:22.240 --> 48:25.600]  Like do you see that as I mean happening or are we just kind of fucked
[48:26.640 --> 48:30.080]  No, I I think I I I do like we were growing the swazi gold
[48:30.560 --> 48:32.800]  We're gonna grow a batch out this year and it's like
[48:33.660 --> 48:37.600]  Amazing like sativa smoke and high like
[48:38.800 --> 48:40.800]  So I think for people
[48:41.040 --> 48:43.680]  Who are sativa lovers, which there are more, you know
[48:46.000 --> 48:48.320]  I I think that it does and it will sell
[48:48.960 --> 48:54.240]  Um, and the haze is more probably popular than like the swazi gold just like it has a more popular name
[48:55.360 --> 48:57.680]  Um, but we're going to small batch like, you know, six
[48:59.280 --> 49:01.280]  Six plants that are
[49:02.000 --> 49:04.560]  Um, they're tall and skinny they're like
[49:06.400 --> 49:14.160]  12 13 feet tall right now and maybe the biggest ones are five six feet wide like they're definitely
[49:16.400 --> 49:18.400]  Different than anything i've ever grown
[49:19.520 --> 49:21.520]  I mean i'm excited to smoke it
[49:22.560 --> 49:25.600]  But and I and I think that'll sell like if I go to these
[49:26.320 --> 49:32.960]  The like Laytonville farmer's market with some haze or other other other farmer other farmers would buy it, you know, like yeah
[49:33.600 --> 49:35.600]  It's it's pure haze, you know
[49:35.920 --> 49:41.360]  No, that's cool. So you can grow a little bit know that just kind of like within your local community
[49:41.360 --> 49:46.240]  you'll sell out of it and not have to be like I have a lot of this and I need to convince like
[49:47.040 --> 49:48.960]  the big markets
[49:48.960 --> 49:51.120]  To be like no, you don't understand. It's awesome
[49:51.760 --> 49:53.760]  And it costs me a lot more to grow
[49:54.640 --> 49:56.640]  So you need to sell it for more
[49:57.040 --> 49:59.680]  Well, um, you know, um apple and glow greg
[50:00.480 --> 50:03.280]  You know, he enlightened me on it. It's like it's not about
[50:03.900 --> 50:07.200]  Distro, it's about developing a relationship with retail
[50:07.920 --> 50:12.880]  And then you find whatever distro will fulfill it. So, you know you like this is what we have. This is our farm
[50:12.960 --> 50:15.360]  This is our story. Can we get on your shelves?
[50:16.400 --> 50:18.400]  so then and then you find people who will
[50:19.600 --> 50:22.480]  support and it's then even in the retail it's like
[50:23.440 --> 50:25.440]  Our blue thunder is like 17
[50:26.240 --> 50:28.240]  But it's rocket fuel
[50:28.560 --> 50:34.160]  But you have to have someone who's willing to carry that and have someone who's willing to like educate their consumers on it
[50:34.720 --> 50:36.720]  because everyone's so hyped about
[50:37.280 --> 50:42.800]  You know thc numbers when there's so much more, you know going on in the plant that's gonna um affect you
[50:44.480 --> 50:46.480]  So it
[50:47.200 --> 50:49.200]  It is interesting
[50:49.280 --> 50:51.280]  So
[50:51.280 --> 50:53.280]  Yeah, now that that's
[50:54.800 --> 50:56.640]  Given kind of
[50:56.640 --> 51:01.120]  What the market dictates it will value it's a bummer
[51:01.840 --> 51:04.160]  Knowing what the consequences of that will be
[51:05.680 --> 51:07.680]  And hopefully
[51:08.160 --> 51:13.200]  You know, it's like the craft wine where you're just like this shit's amazing and there's not a lot of it
[51:13.920 --> 51:15.920]  um
[51:16.080 --> 51:18.080]  And there's a lot to explore
[51:18.560 --> 51:20.560]  Which is why it'd be a bummer of like
[51:21.920 --> 51:24.240]  All these farms started shutting down
[51:25.360 --> 51:26.800]  Yeah, I mean, you know
[51:26.800 --> 51:30.560]  The mendocino county sheriff put out a statement from their surveillance. Uh,
[51:31.120 --> 51:34.960]  Aerial surveillance. It looks like 40 of fields are not planted this year
[51:35.920 --> 51:39.600]  It's probably more like our closest neighbors aren't growing
[51:40.880 --> 51:45.840]  You know, there's just a handful of people on this mountain still growing and only I think two legal farms
[51:46.640 --> 51:48.320]  You know
[51:48.320 --> 51:50.320]  it's uh
[51:51.520 --> 51:53.280]  Yeah, I mean you look at um
[51:53.280 --> 52:00.260]  How many small businesses walmart put under how many amazon's putting under it's the same thing happening in cannabis and it is unfortunate
[52:01.920 --> 52:04.800]  But I don't know I I uh
[52:06.720 --> 52:10.400]  I'm hoping there's a silver lining somewhere and and it might just be now that like
[52:10.560 --> 52:12.720]  Everyone's in the belly of the beast together now
[52:13.280 --> 52:14.880]  and we better
[52:14.880 --> 52:17.040]  Cut our way out before we come become poop
[52:20.650 --> 52:22.330]  Yeah
[52:22.330 --> 52:25.710]  Travis would now be the time to play some inspirational music
[52:27.750 --> 52:29.750]  Absolutely
[52:29.770 --> 52:32.090]  Did he reach back out to you or no, is he awake?
[52:32.730 --> 52:34.730]  uh, probably not but uh
[52:35.450 --> 52:37.930]  I can I can play it again tomorrow. So
[52:39.610 --> 52:45.930]  Uh to give context, uh, that's great. We're hearing that though. I have to say that before the positivity, uh
[52:47.210 --> 52:49.370]  Yeah, empty farms. Greg. Mar
[52:49.930 --> 52:56.250]  Yeah. Yeah, I I coined it the great california thistle bowl because you drive past like these old
[52:56.810 --> 52:59.930]  You know these hoop houses and there's just thistles growing. Yeah
[53:02.410 --> 53:04.490]  But it's it's changed, you know, it's in
[53:05.930 --> 53:11.930]  I think there really is like a bigger picture on you know, this like form of economics and capitalism
[53:12.010 --> 53:14.810]  That's just extracting everything and it you know
[53:15.770 --> 53:18.890]  Uh, I think we have an opportunity to
[53:19.930 --> 53:23.850]  you know do support farms and brands that are doing regenerative practices and
[53:25.290 --> 53:27.290]  Well, I I I feel like
[53:28.170 --> 53:30.170]  all of you
[53:30.170 --> 53:31.930]  Need to survive
[53:31.930 --> 53:36.890]  Until it turns into a normal market like in a normal market. You can sell your
[53:38.250 --> 53:40.250]  spanish wine to
[53:40.810 --> 53:43.130]  New york or your french wine like
[53:43.770 --> 53:45.770]  your china
[53:47.050 --> 53:53.930]  Yes, no, so so like 32 in in normal world like
[53:55.610 --> 53:57.610]  You're growing in a
[53:57.770 --> 54:03.130]  You're in like one the the wine growing like the best wine growing regions of the world
[54:03.610 --> 54:05.610]  And everyone's like we want their stuff
[54:06.330 --> 54:11.290]  Right, and uh, if you could just do that all of you guys would be like, ah
[54:12.010 --> 54:15.530]  This is I mean you have to you have to you have to wonder why we can't do that now
[54:15.530 --> 54:18.490]  Why it's not like been federally legalized too, you know
[54:19.290 --> 54:21.290]  Yeah
[54:22.010 --> 54:26.090]  But what's interesting is then they're the glass houses down in in uh
[54:26.890 --> 54:28.410]  now in ventura
[54:28.410 --> 54:31.470]  Who are like we're the opposite end of the spectrum?
[54:31.930 --> 54:36.510]  We're we want to be massive so that we can sell the budweiser
[54:38.150 --> 54:39.610]  Globally
[54:39.610 --> 54:41.210]  um
[54:41.450 --> 54:43.770]  and you guys would want to sell the craft and and
[54:44.970 --> 54:47.930]  Yeah, didn't they know you don't want to live in a glass house? Isn't that?
[54:48.330 --> 54:51.370]  You know, like I don't isn't that like the the moral of that story?
[54:52.010 --> 54:55.930]  But in the short term they're pumping out so much supply
[54:57.210 --> 55:00.570]  Right that like the rest of you are like would you guys stop doing that?
[55:01.610 --> 55:04.890]  I mean that that's I think that's uh a small part of the problem
[55:04.970 --> 55:09.850]  I think a much larger part of the problem was like there's the rollout of of 64 too
[55:10.570 --> 55:13.610]  I mean for one we're supposed to have like this
[55:14.170 --> 55:19.050]  You know, it wasn't supposed to be like till 2023 until anyone was allowed to grow more than one acre
[55:19.850 --> 55:23.050]  You know and they didn't we didn't get six months and then you know
[55:23.190 --> 55:28.670]  California had medical since 96 and there was no transitional rollout from medical to recreational
[55:29.050 --> 55:32.650]  It was all medical operations stopped start from scratch
[55:33.530 --> 55:36.170]  record here you guys, you know, it just it was
[55:36.250 --> 55:42.810]  And I I you know the um conspiracy theorist in me has to wonder if it wasn't on purpose, you know
[55:43.850 --> 55:45.850]  We'll find out now that like so now
[55:45.990 --> 55:48.170]  California heritage farmers are going under
[55:48.970 --> 55:55.850]  We'll see if it becomes legal next year that they did it on purpose. It's like federal legalization happens in 2023. It's like
[55:59.140 --> 56:02.500]  Anyway, yeah get out the tinfoil guys. We're going deep
[56:02.580 --> 56:04.580]  I
[56:04.820 --> 56:08.440]  Left, uh, I left california in uh mid 2017
[56:09.540 --> 56:16.420]  And it wasn't because prop 64 it was because of uh, lots of various, uh situations including living conditions, but
[56:17.380 --> 56:20.580]  It seems like it was a blessing in disguise. I mean, they're really
[56:22.900 --> 56:28.660]  Like I would have said I could I definitely would have and tried to you know, keep living the dream but
[56:28.820 --> 56:35.060]  It's crazy, yeah, I mean it's an interesting dream to hold on to it's like mediterranean climate mediterranean climate love growing things
[56:35.780 --> 56:41.300]  What the fuck are you guys doing in california though with the pot? You know and all other stuff, you know the rent and the
[56:42.180 --> 56:44.180]  crazy
[56:46.180 --> 57:02.930]  Yeah, that's kind of what I was saying before is if you can just last a little longer
[57:04.210 --> 57:07.410]  Well, you know luckily, you know, it's this is family land and it's
[57:07.570 --> 57:13.810]  That's huge and it's yeah and it's a regenerative agriculture, which is you know affordable because
[57:15.010 --> 57:16.130]  uh
[57:16.130 --> 57:18.130]  You know, you're closing the loops in the system
[57:18.130 --> 57:22.850]  You're building you're like building this healthy living soil, which you know doesn't need a lot of inputs
[57:24.370 --> 57:28.130]  Um and like heart rocks like, you know, it's like uh people want to cut like
[57:29.330 --> 57:33.810]  You know, it's I think interns is always a good thing. I mean, you know, it's it's it's it's
[57:33.810 --> 57:40.370]  You know, it's I think interns is also part of the future too because people hit me up all the time to come like
[57:40.450 --> 57:43.810]  Learn on the farm for a season. So I think we might start taking people up on that
[57:44.450 --> 57:47.730]  You know, i'd love to get a couple interns for next year who want to like
[57:48.370 --> 57:54.130]  Not only learn how to grow calf cannabis, but see the whole nursery production from seed to pollen to see it again
[57:55.090 --> 57:58.210]  I again if I didn't have the kids I would like to do that
[57:58.690 --> 58:05.170]  I mean shoot property's gonna be cheap around here. We could just you know, buy up all the mountaintop and you know start a
[58:05.970 --> 58:07.730]  cult or something
[58:07.730 --> 58:12.610]  You know, just just just hear me out just enough of a cult where the government leaves you alone
[58:13.330 --> 58:19.330]  But not enough of a not too much of a cult where they don't you know, there's a fine line, you know where the you know
[58:21.490 --> 58:23.490]  What do you guys think about
[58:23.730 --> 58:26.770]  keeping overhead low as opposed to
[58:27.730 --> 58:33.090]  Trying to put your energy into generating more sales, which i'm kind of picking up as far as like owning the property
[58:33.090 --> 58:36.230]  You're trying to work off of and not renting a warehouse or xyz
[58:36.770 --> 58:40.690]  Do you guys see that smart part of the strategy to just keep overhead low?
[58:41.250 --> 58:47.650]  In this in between time before federal is federal legalization instead of trying to just dominate the sales space
[58:48.370 --> 58:50.370]  Oh, yeah. I mean that's definitely
[58:51.490 --> 58:53.490]  Part of the strategy. It's just it's
[58:54.450 --> 58:56.450]  It's hard to grow
[58:57.250 --> 59:04.850]  like especially on a small, you know, we're like a mountain farm or not a tractor farm either, you know, but it produces like
[59:05.970 --> 59:08.770]  Really high quality can you know, we're northwest slope
[59:09.490 --> 59:10.930]  You know in the pine forest
[59:10.930 --> 59:16.770]  So we're getting that nice shade like people are spending money to cover their ganja with like, you know shade cloth and stuff
[59:16.770 --> 59:19.650]  You know, it really produced a high quality resin and flower
[59:20.450 --> 59:22.450]  But it's and then harvest labor
[59:23.250 --> 59:31.010]  The so even when you if you cut all the costs you can during the seat harvest is just the beast it's really hard
[59:32.610 --> 59:34.930]  You know to get around that, um
[59:38.210 --> 59:40.210]  Uh, I don't you know
[59:40.770 --> 59:46.450]  We're gonna try maybe like using some maybe some labor contractors for for some part of some
[59:46.770 --> 59:51.730]  Of the aspects of harvesting which if you can get some professionals that I can come in for something, you know
[59:51.970 --> 59:53.970]  I don't know. We're definitely
[59:54.130 --> 59:55.410]  I like
[59:55.410 --> 59:58.230]  I like where your head was just set with kind of like a tutorial
[59:58.930 --> 01:00:03.250]  Where like, you know if the up and coming generation wants to see what it's like to work on the farm
[01:00:03.330 --> 01:00:06.050]  It's like come help with the harvest and it's like, you know
[01:00:06.050 --> 01:00:11.810]  You can see the inner workings throughout the year as well. And I really like where your where your mind was going with that
[01:00:11.890 --> 01:00:13.490]  you know, well then
[01:00:13.490 --> 01:00:18.530]  Then you get people who are passionate about the plant and people are passionate about the plant like pay attention and it helps and you
[01:00:18.530 --> 01:00:23.890]  know, I think that can help like in these hard times, you know, and I I know a lot of other farms in the area that
[01:00:24.530 --> 01:00:27.650]  You know do have that like oh, it's like a destination too
[01:00:27.650 --> 01:00:33.810]  It's like you're gonna go on a regenerative farm and like the beautiful countryside like I love it up here
[01:00:33.970 --> 01:00:38.850]  It's you know, we're we're the top of the mountain. That's not too far away either
[01:00:38.850 --> 01:00:46.050]  We're like, you know still 35 minutes from ukiah, you know an hour and a half from santa rosa. So we're
[01:00:46.930 --> 01:00:52.850]  We're out there, but we're still pretty close to civilization, but we're far enough away where you can't hear it which is
[01:00:53.650 --> 01:00:55.970]  It's amazing. So, you know just to
[01:00:56.690 --> 01:00:58.690]  Be up in the forest
[01:00:59.330 --> 01:01:01.330]  in a field of ganja
[01:01:01.490 --> 01:01:06.050]  I was just outside of uh, middletown just south of ukiah, you know, okay
[01:01:06.850 --> 01:01:08.850]  Yeah
[01:01:09.250 --> 01:01:11.810]  Yeah, that's not too far down at all
[01:01:12.130 --> 01:01:14.130]  Um
[01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:24.470]  Looking
[01:01:25.510 --> 01:01:31.750]  In the chat, are there any questions but uh, so should I play that song?
[01:01:33.590 --> 01:01:39.350]  The tune is amazing so we have we have a a world premiere, uh,
[01:01:40.070 --> 01:01:42.470]  someone named david who is
[01:01:42.870 --> 01:01:45.910]  Uh most likely asleep in the uk right now
[01:01:46.790 --> 01:01:51.270]  But potentially awake starting his day, uh sent a song
[01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:54.630]  uh
[01:01:55.350 --> 01:01:59.990]  Which I played for you and I was like, this is awesome but uh
[01:02:02.230 --> 01:02:05.770]  It's a a tribute to the fcp so hold on
[01:02:05.770 --> 01:02:11.860]  Um
[01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:20.740]  You have to play something different so it starts that song back up at the beginning so hold on
[01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:29.940]  This song was inspired by the future cannabis project what's been instrumental in the revolution and dedicated to his viewers special merit goes out
[01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:31.940]  to the
[01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:35.700]  Is this the cucumber guy
[01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:44.420]  I think he called you done. Here's the very that was great. What's that?
[01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:49.140]  I think he called it
[01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:51.700]  It it keeps uh
[01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:55.960]  Not playing it i'm trying to play it from the beginning
[01:02:57.060 --> 01:03:00.340]  And I think I have to like play another song, but then that didn't work
[01:03:01.220 --> 01:03:07.460]  This song was inspired by the future cannabis project who has been instrumental in the revolution and dedicated to his viewers
[01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:09.700]  Special merit goes out to
[01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:20.980]  James
[01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:39.860]  Mean
[01:03:57.220 --> 01:04:03.940]  And a very special thank you for the dedication and for bringing the science into what we believe in goes to dr
[01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:11.300]  Ethan russell chet lowenfels. Dr. Elaine. Engel. Dr. Christine Jones. Dr. James white

[01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:55.520]  Russian
[01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:19.040]  Free thinkers

[01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:34.480]  Brandon
[01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:46.480]  Seven or seven
[01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:55.600]  So
[01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:11.840]  Dragon fire
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:25.280]  Aj
[01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:35.280]  Burn extract
[01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:38.820]  God for those names. I can't remember
[01:06:53.590 --> 01:06:55.590]  All right
[01:06:56.390 --> 01:07:01.350]  That was amazing so that was sent to me, uh
[01:07:03.330 --> 01:07:05.330]  Yesterday
[01:07:05.730 --> 01:07:07.730]  It sounds like the game like
[01:07:08.450 --> 01:07:13.730]  It's like early like i'm like starting my day drinking my coffee like sitting down like
[01:07:14.450 --> 01:07:20.050]  Being like the mountain of shit. I have to do in that day and like starting with my emails and this email comes in
[01:07:20.770 --> 01:07:22.770]  And it's like this really long
[01:07:23.410 --> 01:07:25.410]  like multi-paragraph email
[01:07:27.890 --> 01:07:33.810]  And then he attached these two songs and I was like, holy shit, that's amazing
[01:07:35.330 --> 01:07:37.330]  and and some of it's from like
[01:07:38.690 --> 01:07:40.530]  A week and a half ago
[01:07:40.530 --> 01:07:46.930]  So he's like incorporating stuff from like way way back in time. I'm like, I don't even remember all this shit
[01:07:47.970 --> 01:07:50.070]  He's like, dr. Mike amaranthus
[01:07:52.690 --> 01:07:55.510]  He took some serious notes that was awesome
[01:07:57.890 --> 01:08:00.950]  So I thought that would lift everybody's spirits
[01:08:01.350 --> 01:08:03.350]  Uh
[01:08:03.510 --> 01:08:05.510]  If you're tired you're now like
[01:08:08.070 --> 01:08:12.070]  I'm so tired. You're like now i'm still tired. Uh
[01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:19.750]  Well, so just quick all right, let's go through some of the uh, so you
[01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:23.270]  some of the new stuff you're breeding and then uh,
[01:08:24.230 --> 01:08:26.950]  some of the stuff you already have out there i'm looking at like the
[01:08:27.030 --> 01:08:29.030]  The
[01:08:30.390 --> 01:08:33.910]  There's a you have like a lot of auto which is awesome
[01:08:35.910 --> 01:08:37.910]  Yeah, um
[01:08:38.550 --> 01:08:40.550]  Because I they're
[01:08:41.270 --> 01:08:46.150]  Definitely easy to breed because you can do large like
[01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:49.610]  I think we just made 111
[01:08:49.990 --> 01:08:51.990]  111
[01:08:52.150 --> 01:08:56.810]  Combinations of auto flowers and that was from starting with like the lion claw stock
[01:08:57.130 --> 01:09:03.130]  Breeding it into full terms and then breeding them again so that they start to express the auto flower trait
[01:09:04.090 --> 01:09:09.130]  And this year we did like plots of them with the three uh, three types of autos per plot
[01:09:09.290 --> 01:09:12.170]  But the middle one was the only one that was the breeder
[01:09:14.010 --> 01:09:16.010]  Um
[01:09:16.570 --> 01:09:18.970]  Yeah, so it and it's just fun to
[01:09:20.570 --> 01:09:26.010]  To breed and grow autos. I mean i'm i'm a fan. I know that people people hate it, but especially for your
[01:09:27.370 --> 01:09:32.730]  you know your backyard or I do see commercial aspects to them, you know, and and
[01:09:34.410 --> 01:09:41.530]  Give me enough time and I think we'll be able to grow the autos for production and people won't know
[01:09:43.930 --> 01:09:48.090]  That they're autos because we're not going to tell them those are fighting words
[01:09:50.570 --> 01:09:52.810]  There are a lot of people saying they will never
[01:09:54.090 --> 01:09:55.690]  yeah, I mean
[01:09:55.690 --> 01:09:57.530]  I think if if
[01:09:57.530 --> 01:10:01.530]  Just like what you know, some people don't like growing from seed. They like growing from clown too
[01:10:02.890 --> 01:10:04.890]  Oh, you're back
[01:10:05.290 --> 01:10:07.290]  I think some people don't also
[01:10:07.370 --> 01:10:09.370]  People also don't like growing from seed
[01:10:09.770 --> 01:10:11.610]  They like growing from clown
[01:10:11.610 --> 01:10:17.850]  You know because you even in the seed batch you see that uh variation in it and in an auto population
[01:10:17.930 --> 01:10:21.850]  You're growing way more so you're just going to see maybe more of that
[01:10:23.290 --> 01:10:25.850]  But we grow, you know, you grow a stable enough seed
[01:10:28.410 --> 01:10:34.030]  You know, you will see some that you can't blend in with with the rest of it, but it's usually a small percentage
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:41.760]  How when you're breed like
[01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:48.160]  At your scale you have a bunch of you're not like
[01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:50.240]  Like
[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:52.240]  Like you're gonna have a lot of males
[01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:54.800]  of different cultivars
[01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:57.200]  Going at the same time
[01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:02.880]  So in terms of breeding, how do you make sure that like pollen from one thing doesn't get into other stuff?
[01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:06.400]  I mean
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:10.880]  Usually you really have to be on it and um, so like when I do
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:18.480]  A harvest from the male garden, which we have like, you know an in-ground male garden
[01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:23.520]  When i'm done harvesting that pollen for the day you like spray things down
[01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:28.080]  So if you catch you want to harvest your males like before they open up
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:31.360]  Like just when they just start to open up
[01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:35.680]  So then you harvest the males that are just starting to open up and then you spray the other ones down
[01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:38.720]  So it kind of you're still probably going to get some cross pollen
[01:11:39.340 --> 01:11:42.640]  Contamination, but it should be rare. But yeah
[01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:48.000]  Growing like how you know in breeding how we breed are like
[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:52.960]  Other outdoor growers like moon gazers green source garden. You're gonna get some pollen
[01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:59.960]  Um
[01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:02.440]  Yeah, and then our little male garden is just like tucked away
[01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:09.400]  On the little like section of the of the land that doesn't get a lot of wind kind of in a little hole
[01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:12.760]  And we do have wind wind screens up. And yeah, you just have to be
[01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:17.400]  On it like when I have a very relaxing
[01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:20.760]  Male garden this year. I think I only planted like
[01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:23.980]  Four or five rows of like 15 rows
[01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:29.240]  Um
[01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:31.240]  Yeah, I did a great inner
[01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:33.800]  Podcast for shango on shaping fire
[01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:36.440]  and I think that
[01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:42.760]  And I think that I had uh was talking about I did over
[01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:47.780]  150 males
[01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:50.520]  That
[01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:54.280]  Year, and yeah, it was like a lot of late not there was I was out there
[01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:58.040]  A lot of late nights like two three in the morning like, you know
[01:12:58.260 --> 01:13:03.400]  Harvesting pollen moving pollen through the boxes and spraying things down, you know, it's
[01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:06.360]  It is a lot of work
[01:13:11.020 --> 01:13:13.020]  Yeah, no, that's
[01:13:13.820 --> 01:13:15.820]  I find like
[01:13:16.540 --> 01:13:19.740]  Like keeping one or two males, uh
[01:13:21.020 --> 01:13:23.420]  from not like spraying everything challenging so
[01:13:24.380 --> 01:13:26.060]  I can imagine
[01:13:26.060 --> 01:13:28.060]  well, and you know part of it is
[01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:29.980]  Like the unique
[01:13:29.980 --> 01:13:35.340]  You know area where our farm is at because we're nestled at the end of the road and behind us is a massive
[01:13:35.420 --> 01:13:38.540]  Like cattle ranch and behind them is the national forest
[01:13:39.340 --> 01:13:41.340]  So, you know, we're really not gonna
[01:13:42.860 --> 01:13:45.600]  Mess anybody up in the neighborhood
[01:13:49.030 --> 01:13:51.030]  Yeah, do people in uh
[01:13:53.350 --> 01:13:59.430]  Like obviously the areas where they're like we're gonna grow a ton of hemp here everyone's like no
[01:14:01.190 --> 01:14:05.110]  So are there areas like that we're just like
[01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:09.030]  There's just so much pollen everywhere
[01:14:10.790 --> 01:14:13.350]  Not that I've heard of other than from like hemp
[01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:23.840]  You know, right so like in in counties that allow that that's where i'm going like counties that allow large oh
[01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:29.200]  Yeah, I I even heard just right next door in lake county when they did like larger hemp
[01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:35.300]  Grows there like it definitely sent some pollen out, but I haven't heard of anything other than like southern oregon
[01:14:35.460 --> 01:14:41.230]  Um
[01:14:44.510 --> 01:14:50.110]  Um, so so then of the uh, we were just talking about auto
[01:14:50.750 --> 01:14:52.750]  autos before but of the
[01:14:54.670 --> 01:14:58.590]  Photo period stuff i'm just looking on the website. Uh
[01:15:03.060 --> 01:15:06.820]  Like is the 88 sphinx og and the bubble gum and the
[01:15:07.940 --> 01:15:09.940]  Jackfruit, is that all photo?
[01:15:10.820 --> 01:15:13.620]  Yeah, those are um, well the bubble gum I think's an auto
[01:15:14.740 --> 01:15:17.940]  That or I see lemon cush. All right. Hold on
[01:15:18.980 --> 01:15:24.420]  That you're carrying there. Um, the 88 sphinx is a photo period. That's the one that has like so it's like the
[01:15:25.300 --> 01:15:31.860]  It's the that's the late season one and that's got like the uh, the gas and candy peaches on that one. Really nice
[01:15:33.460 --> 01:15:41.020]  Um
[01:15:42.540 --> 01:15:44.860]  I could have just done that before but uh
[01:15:45.820 --> 01:15:48.700]  Okay, lemon cush full term and I I didn't
[01:15:50.140 --> 01:15:54.940]  Get to pull off as nice of a nursery as I as I'd like to and I think I just need to like
[01:15:55.260 --> 01:15:58.940]  Scale back a little further next year so I can really focus on the nursery
[01:15:59.980 --> 01:16:01.980]  um
[01:16:03.340 --> 01:16:05.820]  So scale back from the commercial side
[01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:11.820]  Yes, i'm from like the flower because flower is just an expensive hobby these days
[01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:24.720]  So is this photo yeah, right, okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm
[01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:29.840]  Yeah, yeah like all these it's like
[01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:34.320]  Is that you you brought that to f6
[01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:42.240]  Um, I did two generations that I got it at least at an f6 from sun roots and covalo. Yeah
[01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:45.680]  Um
[01:16:56.200 --> 01:16:59.080]  I definitely have some more pictures to throw out this year
[01:17:05.950 --> 01:17:07.950]  So lemon head from willets
[01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:14.500]  And uh, the strawberry goo is also from sun roots
[01:17:19.390 --> 01:17:27.150]  Covo yeah, you know covo is an amazing valley for growing. I think the the autos are the 50 packs still
[01:17:30.270 --> 01:17:33.310]  Yeah, yeah the purple leone yeah
[01:17:33.310 --> 01:17:42.920]  Yeah
[01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:47.420]  I definitely have pictures of the extremely citrus. That's a really nice sativa
[01:17:57.850 --> 01:18:00.570]  There's a ron coming through his tapestry there
[01:18:02.890 --> 01:18:05.690]  He's back has the missus
[01:18:08.330 --> 01:18:13.130]  Uh, uh ordaining a wedding this weekend she's traveling
[01:18:14.650 --> 01:18:16.650]  Oh, she's out of town
[01:18:19.010 --> 01:18:22.330]  Commencing a ceremony of uh eternal union
[01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:31.590]  Yeah, yeah, is it is it that cold there rotten that you got the hat and flannel all the time like i'm sitting here
[01:18:32.390 --> 01:18:37.750]  No, I go to the house. I try to keep it as climate controlled as I can for various reasons
[01:18:37.750 --> 01:18:44.070]  Whether it be the gardens or just the flower itself or it's more important the rest of the life usually
[01:18:44.310 --> 01:18:48.520]  So i'm like sweating here on the couch
[01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:52.760]  Overlayed it's summer's not over here
[01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:55.640]  Actually in la it's it's nice. It's like
[01:18:56.760 --> 01:18:58.760]  slightly cool
[01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:01.960]  We're we're off. We're off grid too. So we here we don't get a
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000]  run climate control
[01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:08.440]  Unless it's really hot and fire up the generator
[01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:12.280]  Do people dig down and like
[01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:18.020]  Like, you know how like if you were in like a basement it's cooler. Yeah
[01:19:20.340 --> 01:19:22.340]  Like they should right
[01:19:23.380 --> 01:19:25.380]  Yeah, like we don't really
[01:19:25.380 --> 01:19:31.060]  Well, like one of the things I noticed in a lot of california or at least in la like nobody has basements
[01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:34.820]  And on the east coast growing up like everybody had basements
[01:19:35.460 --> 01:19:40.020]  And I didn't know if that was like because of earthquakes or if they were like no we're good on the east coast
[01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:44.660]  Yeah, I mean I know in the east coast you need that so your pipes don't freeze right it's like
[01:19:47.220 --> 01:19:53.060]  I don't know why you need or why they were needed at some point, but it's it was a good thing to have
[01:19:53.780 --> 01:19:55.780]  Yeah, I mean I would love a basement
[01:19:57.460 --> 01:20:01.300]  I think i've only seen one basement on the west coast. It was in the santa cruz mountains
[01:20:02.100 --> 01:20:05.300]  All right, so i'm not imagining like i'm not the only person that's like
[01:20:05.300 --> 01:20:09.460]  Growing up my our basement was like, uh, the
[01:20:10.740 --> 01:20:16.660]  Nightmare on elm street basement with the big boilers like like fire like coming out and
[01:20:18.100 --> 01:20:20.100]  It was scary as shit, but
[01:20:20.980 --> 01:20:24.580]  And I know in mendo like a lot of the hippies that built
[01:20:25.300 --> 01:20:28.980]  Basements were like, you know, they were like, you know, they were like, you know, they were like
[01:20:29.460 --> 01:20:31.460]  It was scary as shit, but
[01:20:32.180 --> 01:20:36.820]  And I know in mendo like a lot of the hippies that built, you know, the backs of the land houses
[01:20:37.220 --> 01:20:39.220]  they weren't digging basements, they were just
[01:20:39.940 --> 01:20:42.020]  They didn't have like a lot of machinery or anything
[01:20:43.540 --> 01:20:45.540]  But were they digging down?
[01:20:47.220 --> 01:20:48.500]  No
[01:20:48.500 --> 01:20:52.180]  Yeah, i'm living in a very nice built hippie house
[01:20:52.820 --> 01:20:54.820]  because even like i've seen
[01:20:55.220 --> 01:21:00.020]  And maybe this was I think it was just on youtube like a video of of someone
[01:21:00.820 --> 01:21:03.540]  not cannabis related or anything, but just like
[01:21:04.100 --> 01:21:05.300]  they they
[01:21:05.300 --> 01:21:07.300]  dug down like
[01:21:07.620 --> 01:21:09.220]  seven feet
[01:21:09.220 --> 01:21:12.100]  And had a greenhouse, but then it was also
[01:21:13.780 --> 01:21:17.060]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah and so like walla walla pini
[01:21:18.580 --> 01:21:20.580]  Yeah, and uh
[01:21:20.660 --> 01:21:22.660]  I
[01:21:22.740 --> 01:21:24.740]  Was always intrigued by that just like
[01:21:25.700 --> 01:21:30.820]  It should be more like I would love a weed cave into the mountain
[01:21:34.970 --> 01:21:37.290]  You can go out there with a jackhammer every day
[01:21:38.730 --> 01:21:45.370]  You know like get some of these doomsday preppers just to build me like a ganja cellar and like a seat is you know
[01:21:47.130 --> 01:21:49.130]  The the seed office
[01:21:49.290 --> 01:21:53.710]  In the apocalypse I will supply everyone's weed i'm a very important contributor
[01:21:55.210 --> 01:21:58.250]  I just don't think we're gonna have an apocalypse. So, you know, it'd be good use of
[01:21:58.890 --> 01:22:01.210]  All the you know, these guys know how to do it
[01:22:05.190 --> 01:22:07.190]  It would be interesting to have an apocalypse
[01:22:08.310 --> 01:22:14.710]  I feel like the beginning of coronavirus was like the closest we've gotten to like it was just like so surreal and weird
[01:22:15.510 --> 01:22:17.350]  um
[01:22:17.350 --> 01:22:19.590]  You know, maybe we're in an apocalypse right now
[01:22:19.670 --> 01:22:24.390]  It's just not how hollywood told us it was gonna happen. But like this is actually like the world ending
[01:22:25.110 --> 01:22:27.110]  in something else beginning
[01:22:29.660 --> 01:22:37.260]  It's more subtle I feel like at least climate change is like current text instead of talking about it in like a future context
[01:22:37.580 --> 01:22:39.180]  you know, like
[01:22:39.180 --> 01:22:45.740]  it's a crazy variable, so I just want to acknowledge chris doing research and coming up with a
[01:22:46.620 --> 01:22:48.940]  An answer to that question
[01:22:54.230 --> 01:22:57.370]  Citing sources earthquakes unbelievable
[01:23:00.150 --> 01:23:04.470]  Chris whipped out google and got to the bottom of it
[01:23:07.030 --> 01:23:11.830]  But yeah that site but if you're I understand it would be quicker but uh
[01:23:13.350 --> 01:23:16.870]  Whoever's house it is has 33 less house, right?
[01:23:17.510 --> 01:23:23.990]  Or like whatever it is like adding so first floor second floor and then having a basement too
[01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:30.880]  So it may be quicker but
[01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:37.180]  Yeah, so the only thing I could think of was the earthquakes
[01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:41.160]  Because otherwise it makes no sense
[01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:47.560]  There's no logical reason why you would not just build a basement too if you're building a house
[01:23:51.790 --> 01:23:53.790]  So, all right, well why
[01:23:54.510 --> 01:23:56.510]  Why don't we uh
[01:23:56.830 --> 01:23:58.990]  What time do you normally start your day in the morning?
[01:24:00.750 --> 01:24:03.310]  You know, it depends on I think there's uh
[01:24:04.510 --> 01:24:05.950]  kids and
[01:24:05.950 --> 01:24:08.510]  Wife all have a cold. I haven't got it yet. So
[01:24:09.390 --> 01:24:10.270]  um
[01:24:10.270 --> 01:24:13.870]  i've been up a lot if i'm off a lot with the then
[01:24:14.830 --> 01:24:20.830]  you know, I won't start my day till like, you know eight or something, but if I if I get some sleep from
[01:24:21.470 --> 01:24:24.430]  Which as a you know parent can be rare sometimes
[01:24:25.630 --> 01:24:27.630]  um sunrise
[01:24:27.870 --> 01:24:33.310]  Yeah, no, I always try to sneak as much as I can in before my kids all wake up
[01:24:34.590 --> 01:24:36.590]  Because then i'm just like
[01:24:38.030 --> 01:24:42.990]  I'm not getting anything done now. Yeah, I mean and it's I get a
[01:24:44.910 --> 01:24:49.470]  Take the kids around the mountain on the four-wheeler and you know, it's check on things and
[01:24:51.390 --> 01:24:53.150]  uh, it's
[01:24:53.150 --> 01:24:55.150]  Your farm life's a little different
[01:24:55.390 --> 01:24:56.910]  but
[01:24:56.910 --> 01:25:00.510]  Our like bodhi helped me like put together the pollen boxes, you know, he did one
[01:25:01.150 --> 01:25:05.230]  And then you know, he was oh, I just want to drill holes in the floor after that
[01:25:08.670 --> 01:25:10.190]  Um
[01:25:10.190 --> 01:25:16.670]  Well, yeah, what did what I realized as I was like working extra hard to take a couple of days off to go camping
[01:25:16.910 --> 01:25:21.870]  With friends that a farmer is never caught up on work the seasons just change
[01:25:23.070 --> 01:25:25.070]  yeah, so so you just
[01:25:26.590 --> 01:25:29.630]  But at least uh in winter, um
[01:25:31.070 --> 01:25:33.070]  You don't have to get stuff done
[01:25:34.590 --> 01:25:40.670]  I love that thought though work is never done. The seasons just change. Yeah. I mean that's like that's it was that
[01:25:41.630 --> 01:25:43.630]  Pinball machine
[01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:48.560]  And uh, you know, I usually
[01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:52.080]  It changes with the seasons like when it's really hot in the summer
[01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:56.560]  like I like to spend midday with the family work in the mornings and the evenings and you know things just
[01:25:57.840 --> 01:25:59.680]  just shift
[01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:01.680]  as the season shift and
[01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:05.040]  um winter is definitely my favorite season
[01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:10.320]  For a number of reasons, you know, it's the it's the weekend for the farmer too, you know
[01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:13.760]  You get that one long work week, which is spring and summer
[01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:17.040]  And then you got this crazy friday
[01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:20.000]  Which is harvest?
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:23.760]  And it's and then you have a very short weekend, which is filled with way too many projects
[01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:26.320]  Which is winter but it's still
[01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:30.400]  And I love that the water comes with the rain here in, you know, california
[01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:35.040]  Just the rainy season isn't like some people like oh, no the rainy season is coming. We might all die
[01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:38.720]  You know or something, you know, or it's like we're not gonna see the sunshine forever
[01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:40.720]  but it's like, you know, we just you never
[01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:45.680]  You never get it. It's like la drivers the one time per year that it does rain
[01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:49.440]  They're all like oh my god, like what how do I drive in this stuff?
[01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:57.680]  And coming from the from new england where you're like driving 80 miles an hour in like snow and ice storms with like black
[01:26:57.760 --> 01:27:02.720]  Ice all over the roads and then you come to la and everyone's like slowing way down
[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:05.600]  when it rains
[01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:11.200]  I think part of it is set so many people in california care less about their uh tires
[01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:17.200]  You know where it's like if 95% of the time it doesn't matter if your tires are totally bald, maybe
[01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:24.400]  Look serafina, you're on youtube. What do you think? No, she doesn't like you too. Gosh all your
[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:27.840]  Baby classmates they're gonna recognize you
[01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:30.800]  you'll be like
[01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:33.200]  That's the girl from youtube
[01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:38.320]  Yeah, she has a little tummy what uh
[01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:42.800]  Oh, sorry with with uh water
[01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:46.960]  Like you are you guys trying to catch as much rain?
[01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:49.520]  Like like what's you were talking about a drought?
[01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:56.480]  So like what's what's been kind of the cycle of weather for the past couple years and yeah, well, you know, um
[01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:00.800]  We have a rain catchment pond
[01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:04.400]  Um, we need another one to get through the extreme droughts
[01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:06.640]  um, well
[01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:11.680]  You know what? I hear people talking about too is that we're not just experiencing droughts in the west coast. We're
[01:28:12.860 --> 01:28:16.480]  Experiencing the desertification or the erratification of the west
[01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:19.600]  You think about it? There used to be a rain forest here on the coast
[01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:23.920]  Of california, you know two million acres of old growth
[01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:27.360]  redwood trees, which is a temperate rain forest and
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:30.880]  You know you look at like the uh
[01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:35.840]  The western united states used to have eight times more surface water, you know due to beavers
[01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:38.800]  and yet we can't
[01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:45.040]  Legally, you know dam up a drainage because fishing game says you can't you know, so
[01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:52.720]  I I think we're in a bit of a bind here and we're gonna have to like change some policy eventually to get out of
[01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:54.000]  it, but
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.160]  And you know the short term more, uh
[01:28:57.440 --> 01:28:59.440]  catchment more storage
[01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:02.560]  Um because even in a drought year
[01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:06.400]  If you have the catchment and storage you can farm
[01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:10.240]  At least on a small scale
[01:29:15.740 --> 01:29:19.020]  And we use a lot of mulch and we you do the inline drippers
[01:29:19.580 --> 01:29:23.340]  That are like the slow drippers under the mulch so that really can save a lot of water
[01:29:23.980 --> 01:29:25.260]  you know
[01:29:25.260 --> 01:29:26.700]  um
[01:29:26.700 --> 01:29:32.060]  And I guess you know if your cannabis prefers to be too dry then too wet
[01:29:32.780 --> 01:29:39.580]  So you're also going to get like a more terpene rich, you know kind of if you're a little short on the water
[01:29:41.260 --> 01:29:43.260]  It does produce like a real flavorful
[01:29:44.620 --> 01:29:46.620]  Uh flower
[01:29:48.060 --> 01:29:51.660]  And you know, we've been like thinning the forest and chipping the forest and and
[01:29:52.540 --> 01:29:53.820]  uh
[01:29:53.820 --> 01:29:56.860]  Doing a lot of forestry work too. And yeah, I think
[01:29:57.020 --> 01:30:00.640]  I heard this up. Uh pomo elder who was the indigenous?
[01:30:01.820 --> 01:30:03.340]  um, we're
[01:30:03.340 --> 01:30:05.340]  We're at right now
[01:30:05.420 --> 01:30:12.380]  And you know, she said california wasn't you know wild land. This was like tended land and I think we're out of that relationship with
[01:30:13.820 --> 01:30:16.300]  The land and I think that does affect
[01:30:18.540 --> 01:30:21.500]  Uh the weather and the water
[01:30:22.060 --> 01:30:27.820]  And the water, you know, like the eel river recovery project when when when they first started
[01:30:29.100 --> 01:30:31.020]  um
[01:30:31.020 --> 01:30:33.020]  Studying and taking like data from the field
[01:30:33.580 --> 01:30:35.020]  You know, they thought it was like
[01:30:35.020 --> 01:30:40.060]  Oh commercial cannabis use that was like causing streams and creeks to go dry and stuff
[01:30:40.540 --> 01:30:45.020]  And when they got boots on the ground and collecting data, they realized it was logging
[01:30:46.300 --> 01:30:48.300]  Was the greatest?
[01:30:48.460 --> 01:30:55.180]  Reason for uh creeks and streams going dry and you can see it like when I hike these hills that were logged in the 60s
[01:30:55.740 --> 01:30:56.780]  there's like
[01:30:56.780 --> 01:31:01.980]  Huge stumps and they're very well spaced out from each other and then you look in between those huge stumps
[01:31:01.980 --> 01:31:05.120]  It's just like a thick forest. That's totally overgrown
[01:31:06.380 --> 01:31:09.580]  And like an old growth tree is going to take less water
[01:31:10.460 --> 01:31:13.660]  Than a bunch of young trees and smaller trees in the area
[01:31:14.380 --> 01:31:19.260]  Sorry, I went off a little little tangent there I imagine they'd recirculate more
[01:31:19.820 --> 01:31:25.500]  Humidity as well with having that nice canopy instead of a lot of little shrubs just transpiring like
[01:31:27.260 --> 01:31:30.460]  Well, yeah in the the redwoods with seed clouds like in
[01:31:31.020 --> 01:31:33.980]  you know just in the next valley over was like the
[01:31:34.780 --> 01:31:37.500]  You know the edge of a rain forest
[01:31:38.140 --> 01:31:42.940]  That was you know started getting cut down and you know, it was like a little bit of a
[01:31:43.720 --> 01:31:46.460]  Deforestation in the late 1800s and it's like gone
[01:31:47.340 --> 01:31:49.340]  You'd have to wonder, you know
[01:31:49.420 --> 01:31:51.420]  What the climate would be like?
[01:31:51.500 --> 01:31:53.760]  Here if there was uh still a rain forest
[01:31:55.420 --> 01:32:01.020]  And I think like globally and people talk about climate change or whatever but like look at deforestation the whole world over
[01:32:01.500 --> 01:32:04.640]  And I think we have a lot of the issues that we're experiencing
[01:32:09.360 --> 01:32:11.360]  Yeah, just the the climate
[01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:13.760]  in the pacific, I mean
[01:32:13.820 --> 01:32:17.040]  Contrasting from new england where just it's very different like
[01:32:17.920 --> 01:32:20.560]  You go in those four like they always smell like
[01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:23.920]  rich and like moist
[01:32:25.920 --> 01:32:27.920]  Right, you don't get that here
[01:32:28.640 --> 01:32:30.320]  Not right now
[01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:36.400]  You you know, what's crazy? It's actually been a very very dry season up here to the point where
[01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:39.760]  Our greenhouses are essentially in swamp land
[01:32:40.320 --> 01:32:44.720]  And we've been waiting for rain and in maine it's legal to collect
[01:32:45.120 --> 01:32:49.700]  Surface water from your property like no matter what it's a lot looser than california
[01:32:50.160 --> 01:32:56.960]  and even that like we've got piping and trying to you know, get wherever the water does build up to the reservoirs and
[01:32:57.440 --> 01:33:03.600]  I never would have thought that we would have been faced with the same struggles we had out there and essentially a new england swamp
[01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:05.360]  you know and uh
[01:33:05.360 --> 01:33:09.120]  Times are weird when you were saying how you've had so much more rain than normal and in july
[01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:13.680]  We had a july where there was no cloudy days and like that's unheard of up here, you know, so
[01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:15.600]  it's
[01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:20.880]  It's just it's just a strange season over here as well, you know water has an issue in a swamp
[01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:26.400]  I think california set a record from like december to february. That was like totally dry though
[01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:30.320]  Yeah, I can't remember the last time it rained in la
[01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:34.320]  Yeah, I mean la is a desert
[01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:38.000]  It's been like months since the last rain I remember
[01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:43.840]  Yeah
[01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.960]  La is an interesting place. That's for sure. I have family down there
[01:33:53.120 --> 01:33:58.800]  It's like I came from kind of like where he is a little south and uh
[01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:02.560]  Yeah, la is trippy
[01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:06.560]  But it's satisfying too because it's like
[01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:14.480]  When I my memories of like january february and march in new england, uh
[01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:19.120]  Of just how cold it always was
[01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:27.760]  Yeah, my wife's from virginia and like she you know, the seasonal depression is real but like in a second
[01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:32.400]  As being like a california native. It's like I don't think I could ever get enough rain
[01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:41.040]  And cloudy weather i'd be like, you know, I don't know I've never experienced that or like oh it's too cloudy and rainy for too long
[01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:42.080]  like
[01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:46.960]  Just 40 keep it coming just biblical rain. Maybe would be good right now
[01:34:50.640 --> 01:34:52.320]  On so many levels
[01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:54.720]  I don't know if it's seasonal depression or just anxiety
[01:34:54.800 --> 01:35:00.160]  but I prefer the winters just because there's so much mellower and it's a nice slow pace and like I can find time to
[01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:07.440]  Have fun and just refocus and I don't know if it's seasonal depression, but I just get anxiety in the in the summer
[01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:13.760]  Yeah, that's the opposite. Yeah, I don't know. I definitely like winter too. Just I hike a lot more too
[01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:18.080]  In the winter and I used to think it was because it was colder and wetter
[01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:23.440]  But I just realized i'm just so busy now that as I know when I don't hike this time of year
[01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:27.200]  Just going sun up to sundown anyway
[01:35:28.160 --> 01:35:40.570]  Do you have any speculations on when the federal market is going to open just to throw some craziness in there
[01:35:41.850 --> 01:35:43.850]  some hope
[01:35:44.730 --> 01:35:49.770]  You know, so if I was like, you know corporate cannabis and I had like politicians in my back and you know
[01:35:50.330 --> 01:35:52.650]  California has been kind of like the you know
[01:35:53.210 --> 01:35:56.890]  The cannabis community culture here has kind of been sticking it to the man for a long time
[01:35:57.690 --> 01:35:59.690]  I would you know wait till
[01:36:00.250 --> 01:36:03.210]  The heritage farmers in california went bankrupt
[01:36:03.370 --> 01:36:04.970]  Went bankrupt
[01:36:04.970 --> 01:36:06.970]  And then I'd federally legalize it
[01:36:07.690 --> 01:36:09.450]  But they are
[01:36:09.450 --> 01:36:14.250]  Competition, what's the lobbying group that is uh lobbying for that?
[01:36:16.330 --> 01:36:21.230]  It's either I think it's like california and oregon
[01:36:22.970 --> 01:36:24.970]  Based
[01:36:25.370 --> 01:36:30.330]  Yeah, I don't I don't know you you would think it would it would be i've already happened
[01:36:30.970 --> 01:36:36.730]  Because you know here we have a we have a we have a democrat in office in quotes, you know
[01:36:39.130 --> 01:36:45.530]  I speculate not for like another five years on the early side ten years on the outside. I'm a long end
[01:36:46.490 --> 01:36:48.490]  Yeah
[01:36:48.490 --> 01:36:50.490]  It seems like it could be a long time
[01:36:50.490 --> 01:36:53.290]  Crazy speculation, but that's that's right. Yeah
[01:36:56.010 --> 01:36:58.490]  Yeah, because if it wasn't going to happen you think it would happen now
[01:37:01.290 --> 01:37:05.610]  I feel like we've been saying five or ten years for a long long long time
[01:37:05.690 --> 01:37:08.890]  So it's like I feel like it'd have to be another guess like that
[01:37:09.050 --> 01:37:13.470]  Like yeah, I mean when when my dad grew his like first crop in the 70s
[01:37:14.490 --> 01:37:15.850]  he's like
[01:37:15.850 --> 01:37:19.130]  It's gonna be legal in a couple years, you know, they can't just like let this
[01:37:20.970 --> 01:37:22.970]  Go on you know and
[01:37:23.850 --> 01:37:26.350]  You know, we didn't see medical till 96
[01:37:26.430 --> 01:37:30.540]  Yeah, I don't know I mean
[01:37:31.820 --> 01:37:37.410]  Yeah, I don't think it doesn't really seem likely this
[01:37:39.890 --> 01:37:45.090]  But then there you know, there are like our government's so screwy I remember this was like such a good example of how screwy it is
[01:37:47.250 --> 01:37:50.650]  It was in the same session of
[01:37:51.370 --> 01:37:55.370]  Senate or whatever they they voted to approve medical marijuana for veterans
[01:37:56.090 --> 01:38:00.170]  And they voted to keep marijuana a schedule one drug with no medical benefits
[01:38:00.250 --> 01:38:03.930]  And like the same little session there. So yeah, I don't
[01:38:05.610 --> 01:38:11.120]  Yeah
[01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:17.200]  And then again like I don't know there's definitely fears that federal legalization might just add more
[01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:20.160]  trouble to
[01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:25.120]  Small farmers too with you know, another layer of regulation another layer of taxes
[01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:29.680]  Yeah, because it's like county
[01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:32.080]  state
[01:38:32.240 --> 01:38:36.880]  County state federal are all like I want my cut too
[01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:45.040]  Do you guys think international could have more potential to keep small american craft growers going
[01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:47.600]  Like let's say tokyo for an example
[01:38:47.680 --> 01:38:54.960]  I think I mean 28 million people and I think the average price is like 30 some 32 dollars a gram there or something
[01:38:55.040 --> 01:38:55.920]  so
[01:38:55.920 --> 01:38:58.720]  that's almost population of california that
[01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:01.520]  Is used to paying a fair price
[01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:05.760]  And you know
[01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:08.320]  You know about the same number
[01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:12.880]  Cali, but definitely still fetches a good price in europe, you know
[01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:17.600]  Yeah, I think
[01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:21.920]  You know it is like because california does have like one of six
[01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:24.480]  It's one of six mediterranean climates in the world
[01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:30.560]  I I do think in the region and and maybe just the name brand appeal, you know, wherever you are in another country
[01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:32.560]  Like oh I got emerald triangle
[01:39:32.940 --> 01:39:37.520]  Cannabis, you know from this like legacy farm there. It definitely
[01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:40.320]  That's the good hype, you know
[01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:44.000]  Not like I got runs from my buddies indoor
[01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:47.040]  As I think about when that would happen
[01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:50.260]  It's like first we need federal legalization
[01:39:51.060 --> 01:39:58.660]  Then we need trade agreements with like a japan and then you need to make sure that neither side's putting tariffs on
[01:40:00.500 --> 01:40:02.500]  We just need a submarine
[01:40:03.780 --> 01:40:04.820]  Right
[01:40:04.820 --> 01:40:06.180]  That's the
[01:40:06.180 --> 01:40:08.180]  Definitely are like this is how some
[01:40:08.900 --> 01:40:14.100]  Like drugs are smuggled by like larger cartels into europe from the states
[01:40:14.660 --> 01:40:17.540]  The drug submarines or what's the elon musk?
[01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:19.620]  tunnel
[01:40:19.620 --> 01:40:24.260]  Where you can shoot something. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I mean supposedly ups works too
[01:40:26.340 --> 01:40:28.340]  We got an order in tokyo
[01:40:28.660 --> 01:40:30.500]  slap it in that tunnel
[01:40:30.500 --> 01:40:35.300]  and like two hours later some excited japanese person has their like
[01:40:36.420 --> 01:40:38.420]  So i'm i'm so excited about that
[01:40:39.300 --> 01:40:44.500]  I'm gonna start reaching out to people early like and even when I reach out to them be like, you know
[01:40:44.580 --> 01:40:49.060]  I just want to start cementing some relationship for 10 15 years down the line, you know, like
[01:40:49.860 --> 01:40:53.540]  I just think it's such a cool idea like more than the revenue
[01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:58.820]  just to like, you know be able to have our products in like paris or tokyo or like
[01:40:59.200 --> 01:41:03.060]  Algiers or just all these like I don't know for the culture more for the profit
[01:41:03.140 --> 01:41:09.640]  Like i'm already going to start to try to reach out to uh, certain places that I think would be groovy south of france montenegro
[01:41:11.380 --> 01:41:13.380]  Or so, you know what I mean like
[01:41:14.580 --> 01:41:15.620]  Yeah, I mean
[01:41:15.620 --> 01:41:21.860]  There's people there's people when we can export to your country. I would like you to remember me as the guy who will
[01:41:22.500 --> 01:41:23.860]  Bring it to you
[01:41:23.860 --> 01:41:27.220]  Yeah, the lobsters, you know, like you can serve it with this
[01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:32.200]  Specifically a lot of casinos. I want to reach out to I don't know if that's far-fetched
[01:41:32.980 --> 01:41:36.100]  But I try to think in the fourth dimension and look in the future
[01:41:36.740 --> 01:41:40.260]  And it's like those are customers that want like craft
[01:41:41.060 --> 01:41:42.020]  high
[01:41:42.020 --> 01:41:48.020]  Value stuff and are actually willing to pay for it. Not only that actually appreciate it. So i'm thinking about reaching out
[01:41:48.980 --> 01:41:50.340]  let's say
[01:41:50.340 --> 01:41:53.860]  Let's say like the montenegro, you know casino, you know
[01:41:54.020 --> 01:41:59.300]  And like try to get on the yard on the line with someone and just be like can we start even start talking about this?
[01:41:59.380 --> 01:42:03.940]  Yeah, and if not, can I give you I tell you about my very slavic roots
[01:42:06.100 --> 01:42:08.100]  I just think it would be so cool
[01:42:11.440 --> 01:42:13.440]  And let's drink some
[01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:16.960]  Some bathtub grappa together
[01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:28.800]  Oh, I got six percent I might need to find my charger now, I think we we could probably what is it, uh, 11 30
[01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:32.160]  Yeah, it's a good time
[01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:36.000]  But uh, well, thank you for jumping on
[01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:38.880]  I've been wanting to do this for a while
[01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:41.440]  Yeah
[01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:47.600]  Since my wife's not in town right now. I'm like, holy shit. I can do stuff. Okay. Are the kids gone too?
[01:42:49.360 --> 01:42:53.040]  Uh, they are my oldest yeah with me tomorrow
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:59.120]  Yeah, and then the other ones come back the next day. I know that this will be the first harvest today
[01:42:59.600 --> 01:43:02.160]  this will be the first harvest in a couple years where um,
[01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:05.600]  My wife hasn't gone to virginia to see her mom. So
[01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:09.200]  I love the fam here
[01:43:10.160 --> 01:43:15.840]  It's just good so normally she takes the kids too, I mean she has yeah
[01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:21.840]  You know what the there's the the harvest wives vacation club, you know
[01:43:24.320 --> 01:43:29.680]  For the non-industry non-industry wives I definitely get more work done
[01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:32.400]  when
[01:43:32.400 --> 01:43:34.400]  The wife takes the kids out of town
[01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:40.720]  I mean you'd be amazed how much time you have to spend making your bed, you know when the wives not just good. Yeah
[01:43:42.800 --> 01:43:48.320]  Not at all, uh, all right, well, thank you. Yeah, we look we'll
[01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:52.160]  Look forward to getting some more content your way and
[01:43:53.040 --> 01:43:54.240]  Yeah
[01:43:54.240 --> 01:43:57.220]  It's evan is evan limbered up to start filming
[01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:01.040]  I think we're gonna film we're gonna we're gonna shape
[01:44:01.840 --> 01:44:03.840]  We're gonna film in the morning just
[01:44:04.720 --> 01:44:07.440]  Yeah, we're definitely pretty busy with the farm stuff
[01:44:08.080 --> 01:44:11.600]  what I told him I was like just stick a microphone like a
[01:44:12.220 --> 01:44:17.760]  Microphone with the body pack because he got one of those right the the yeah, yeah body pack recorder
[01:44:18.240 --> 01:44:23.680]  So he could he could just run it for like six hours and just pick up you like
[01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:28.880]  Just talking about whatever and then it's like holy shit. That was awesome
[01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:31.840]  I think we could also talk to him and work
[01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:35.040]  I think we should we could definitely do uh
[01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:39.680]  Reality tv, you know, I think that is definitely in our future
[01:44:40.320 --> 01:44:42.320]  yeah, just mic up the whole farm and
[01:44:43.120 --> 01:44:45.120]  Get some crazy hippies there
[01:44:47.520 --> 01:44:49.680]  Especially for the you know, I know I know
[01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:56.400]  I know some crazy people that like for like, you know when you need to spice things up maybe like season five, you know, like
[01:44:57.280 --> 01:45:00.340]  Yeah, I know some some people that could make it interesting
[01:45:02.640 --> 01:45:04.640]  Here comes uncle jim
[01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:10.720]  Like remember I fired you a couple years ago, i'm really sorry about that. Will you you want to come?
[01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:13.360]  Work on the farm again. Just sign this
[01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:18.400]  I was hoping if you're
[01:45:18.560 --> 01:45:22.240]  One question was just gonna be how was your day today? Like what did you do today?
[01:45:23.200 --> 01:45:28.000]  What's the life of you know, what was the life in norcal in august today I was so curious
[01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:32.720]  I I did a big pollen collection harvest today
[01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:38.320]  so I just um, so I kind of designed like these little pollen collection boxes
[01:45:38.940 --> 01:45:40.940]  sperm all day. Yeah
