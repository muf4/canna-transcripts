[00:01.020 --> 00:07.260]  All right, welcome back everyone for our Creature Double feature on this, what day of week are
[00:07.260 --> 00:08.260]  we?
[00:08.260 --> 00:09.260]  Wednesday?
[00:09.260 --> 00:10.260]  Is today Wednesday?
[00:10.260 --> 00:11.540]  Yeah, yeah, Wednesday.
[00:11.540 --> 00:13.220]  That's me, Peter.
[00:13.220 --> 00:17.580]  That is Scott in the Pro Home Studio.
[00:17.580 --> 00:21.420]  Brandon will have his Pro Home Studio soon.
[00:21.420 --> 00:23.300]  Let's get into it.
[00:23.300 --> 00:25.300]  What's top of mind?
[00:26.300 --> 00:31.620]  Well, I guess, you know, conversation started with me and you, Peter, after I watched Brandon's
[00:31.620 --> 00:36.460]  episode and there's some things that I really liked about what he had to say.
[00:36.460 --> 00:42.620]  You know, there's not very many of us cannabis growers that get into the scientific studies.
[00:42.620 --> 00:48.800]  I was really impressed to see that, you know, he's also digesting really difficult things
[00:48.800 --> 00:53.000]  and then communicating them in grower jive, which not many people are doing that.
[00:53.000 --> 00:57.820]  So I think that's something where him and I share similarities.
[00:57.820 --> 01:03.760]  I also really liked some of the ideas or well, you can clearly tell that Brandon is also
[01:03.760 --> 01:06.740]  finding functional strategies for commercial cultivation.
[01:06.740 --> 01:11.100]  I think that's very important because, you know, it's easy in the regenerative community
[01:11.100 --> 01:17.900]  to get really lost in ideas, you know, and we have to as pioneer species, which I would
[01:17.900 --> 01:21.740]  call Brandon a pioneer species as well, you know, he's an early adopter getting in there
[01:21.760 --> 01:22.960]  trying to figure things out.
[01:23.640 --> 01:29.440]  And in order for these organic strategies to compete at scale, they need to work at
[01:29.440 --> 01:31.580]  scale, you know, and they need to be scalable.
[01:31.580 --> 01:34.820]  They need to be able to be spread out through multiple properties.
[01:35.420 --> 01:39.440]  And so I think that's some cool stuff that I think Brandon and I have in common.
[01:40.800 --> 01:43.840]  I have one of Elaine's studies that I really like going over.
[01:43.840 --> 01:47.640]  I don't know if we have the time or bandwidth to go through a study, but that might be kind
[01:47.640 --> 01:49.880]  of cool. We got all sorts of time.
[01:50.260 --> 01:51.580]  Yeah, nice.
[01:52.300 --> 01:55.620]  So, but yeah, I just, you know, I was really impressed with some of the things that Brandon
[01:55.620 --> 02:00.920]  had to say, and it's, you know, it's clear he's doing a lot of the same things that I
[02:00.920 --> 02:06.980]  am. But then I think there's two very different aspects about our cultivation styles in
[02:06.980 --> 02:12.260]  that, you know, I went heavy on the biological analysis to deal with some of the issues and
[02:12.260 --> 02:13.460]  get improvement at scale.
[02:13.700 --> 02:19.100]  And Brandon went kind of the other way with the saturated paste test, which I do and I
[02:19.120 --> 02:24.240]  do the test, but I always, you know, personally, I kind of focus more on the biological
[02:24.240 --> 02:28.280]  stuff. So I think that's really interesting how it sounds like we've come to some of the
[02:28.280 --> 02:32.280]  same conclusions and areas of success through two different lanes.
[02:32.800 --> 02:34.160]  You know, so I think that's kind of cool.
[02:38.220 --> 02:46.700]  Yeah, the all the testing methods is, you know, in my opinion, like the best results
[02:46.700 --> 02:52.040]  that I've seen as far as maximizing each cultivar.
[02:57.330 --> 03:01.770]  Because in this early stage, we have to find a balance between, you know, using our
[03:01.770 --> 03:03.970]  intuition and using some of the data points.
[03:04.690 --> 03:08.890]  And I think, you know, personally, I feel that the more data points you're able to take,
[03:08.890 --> 03:11.650]  the better you can farm organically.
[03:13.890 --> 03:15.890]  We have a...Brandon, can you hear us?
[03:16.590 --> 03:18.830]  Yeah, I'm just having some problems.
[03:18.830 --> 03:20.030]  Just give me one second.
[03:22.430 --> 03:23.990]  Scott, you can monologue for a minute.
[03:23.990 --> 03:27.990]  Well, why don't we jump into the Elaine stuff you were talking about while Brandon's
[03:28.150 --> 03:29.150]  troubleshooting?
[03:29.830 --> 03:33.270]  OK, should I pull it up and do a share screen or?
[03:33.590 --> 03:34.590]  Yeah.
[03:34.630 --> 03:37.470]  OK, let me clear up all my...
[03:41.830 --> 03:43.230]  The embarrassing stuff.
[03:43.770 --> 03:48.210]  Yeah, I was all ready for zooming and we're in a new Arab stream yard.
[03:48.690 --> 03:50.970]  So I had to download some stuff.
[03:50.970 --> 03:52.290]  Let me go to the top page here.
[03:52.290 --> 03:55.250]  I was rereading this earlier today.
[04:02.620 --> 04:03.540]  And look who's back.
[04:03.940 --> 04:05.260]  Whoops. Let's see.
[04:06.620 --> 04:08.380]  Select Windows screen.
[04:09.420 --> 04:10.500]  Hold the entire screen.
[04:11.380 --> 04:12.380]  Yeah, and then just...
[04:13.860 --> 04:15.100]  Thank you. Yeah.
[04:15.500 --> 04:18.420]  We're all up to game this year in all kinds of different areas.
[04:18.440 --> 04:19.600]  OK, so we share screen.
[04:20.160 --> 04:21.400]  Yeah. OK, so here we go.
[04:21.480 --> 04:22.480]  Boom.
[04:23.920 --> 04:26.520]  So this is a paper that was written by Dr.
[04:26.520 --> 04:28.680]  Elaine and actually her husband.
[04:28.840 --> 04:30.720]  Her husband, Russell, is a nematologist.
[04:30.960 --> 04:32.280]  I don't think many people know that.
[04:32.320 --> 04:38.320]  But back in the early years of kind of the soul food web before the online
[04:38.320 --> 04:41.920]  schools, it was very difficult to come in contact with much of Elaine's work.
[04:42.560 --> 04:47.440]  And, you know, in one of the years when I was, you know, tracking her down like a
[04:48.180 --> 04:54.040]  Grateful Dead show, I pulled her aside after a composting event and just kind of
[04:54.040 --> 04:57.220]  asked her, like, you know, where can I come in contact with more of your work?
[04:58.900 --> 05:02.540]  And she said, you should start with Ecological Monograph 1985.
[05:02.700 --> 05:06.900]  And so I wrote that down and I went back and tried searching, tried searching and
[05:06.900 --> 05:10.140]  had a really hard time finding because if you type in Dr.
[05:10.140 --> 05:13.900]  Elaine Ingham Ecological Monograph, you literally get thousands of responses.
[05:13.920 --> 05:18.200]  And so, you know, this paper was kind of also my journey really into some of the
[05:18.200 --> 05:19.280]  scientific literature.
[05:20.120 --> 05:24.960]  And it took me a couple of weeks of searching with no no luck to find this paper.
[05:24.960 --> 05:28.920]  And eventually I contacted a buddy that was in upper graduate program in the
[05:28.920 --> 05:31.200]  biological studies, told him what I was looking for.
[05:31.600 --> 05:34.760]  He went to the school library and came back with like 12 of Dr.
[05:34.760 --> 05:36.560]  Elaine's pages and papers.
[05:36.840 --> 05:39.360]  And this was one of them. So according to Dr.
[05:39.360 --> 05:43.120]  Elaine, you know, this is where a lot of the basis for her work comes.
[05:43.140 --> 05:46.620]  And one of the reasons I had a hard time finding this, I was searching Ecological
[05:46.620 --> 05:49.060]  Monograph, which is the publication it's found within.
[05:49.660 --> 05:52.980]  The title of the paper is actually Interactions of Bacteria, Fungi and their Nematode
[05:52.980 --> 05:56.100]  Grazers, Effects on Nutrient Cycling and Plant Growth.
[05:56.140 --> 06:01.580]  And so prior to this 1985 paper, there was a lot of a lot
[06:01.580 --> 06:06.180]  of measurements that had been taken, but there wasn't a lot showing the effects
[06:06.180 --> 06:10.980]  of plant growth. So there was respiration rates, CO2 production, nitrogen
[06:10.980 --> 06:12.180]  production, things like that.
[06:12.180 --> 06:16.640]  And so the real goal of this paper was to try and quantify the effects
[06:16.960 --> 06:21.920]  on plant growth of the different type of assemblies of organisms.
[06:22.480 --> 06:26.640]  And so when you get to a scientific publication, a lot of times there are two or three
[06:26.640 --> 06:29.760]  pages. This one is like 22 pages.
[06:29.840 --> 06:34.080]  So it's quite long for us, a peer reviewed study.
[06:34.360 --> 06:36.400]  But they all kind of have the same same deal.
[06:36.400 --> 06:40.400]  They'll have a title. They'll tell you who's involved with it and then they'll give you an
[06:40.420 --> 06:45.220]  abstract. And so the abstract is usually a couple of paragraphs giving an idea
[06:45.220 --> 06:47.220]  of really what they're after.
[06:48.380 --> 06:52.420]  In this example, they did two they did two different groups.
[06:52.460 --> 06:54.460]  They did amended and unamended.
[06:54.540 --> 06:58.820]  So the amended group was was given chitin in the form of
[06:59.180 --> 07:00.580]  crustacean meal, I believe.
[07:01.180 --> 07:04.980]  And then for each of the groups, they they
[07:05.840 --> 07:10.280]  you know, sterilized soil, planted grass seeds and then
[07:10.280 --> 07:14.240]  re-inoculated with different combination of organisms.
[07:14.240 --> 07:18.920]  So sterile plant, plant with bacteria, plant with bacteria and fungi,
[07:19.240 --> 07:23.720]  plant with bacteria, bacterial feeding nematodes, plant bacteria, fungi,
[07:23.720 --> 07:28.280]  fungal feeding nematodes. And then they took various measurements over the
[07:28.280 --> 07:31.480]  course of 105 days, I believe.
[07:32.300 --> 07:37.780]  So I kind of went through and highlighted some of the things that really stuck out to me
[07:38.340 --> 07:42.860]  when I first read this that I think really sent me on the journey that I'm on now.
[07:43.980 --> 07:45.780]  Just quickly, Scott, are you on a Mac?
[07:46.340 --> 07:50.580]  Yes, sir. Can you can you do the command plus to make it bigger like the.
[07:53.720 --> 07:55.440]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[07:55.440 --> 07:56.760]  Look at that. Now we can actually read it.
[07:57.520 --> 08:00.440]  So like I said, there's there's a ton going on in this.
[08:00.440 --> 08:02.000]  I don't really want to kind of get through all of it.
[08:02.020 --> 08:03.620]  I encourage you to read it if you'd like.
[08:03.940 --> 08:07.580]  When I first got this, it did take me like two and a half weeks to really define
[08:07.580 --> 08:09.260]  things, really understand what I was reading.
[08:10.280 --> 08:12.620]  But there was a couple of things that really stuck out.
[08:12.620 --> 08:15.100]  And I tried to just quickly highlight some of those.
[08:17.300 --> 08:19.580]  And so in this section, they're talking about.
[08:21.340 --> 08:25.700]  Sorry, I'll try to not spoil so bad, my bad, but kind of the introduction.
[08:25.760 --> 08:31.480]  And so this part I've highlighted here, it says when either amoeba, so that's
[08:31.540 --> 08:36.020]  the predator of bacteria or bacteriophagic nematodes, which means nematodes that
[08:36.020 --> 08:40.900]  eat bacteria, whenever those were introduced to some of the microcosms, nearly
[08:40.900 --> 08:46.000]  all the immobilized nitrogen was remineralized, while less than one third of
[08:46.000 --> 08:49.780]  the ammonia nitrogen was returned in the treatment of bacteria alone.
[08:50.340 --> 08:54.540]  After 24 days, significantly more phosphorus was remineralized in the bacteria
[08:54.540 --> 08:59.020]  and nematode treatment than in either the treatment of bacteria alone or bacteria
[08:59.040 --> 08:59.960]  and amoeba treatment.
[09:00.560 --> 09:04.840]  In a similar study, more nitrogen was remineralized as ammonia nitrogen in the
[09:04.840 --> 09:08.800]  amoeba plus bacteria treatment than in a treatment containing bacteria alone.
[09:09.360 --> 09:13.120]  A treatment with nematodes and bacteria or one with nematodes, amoeba and bacteria.
[09:13.160 --> 09:17.760]  And so some kind of definitions here that kind of pop their way through this paper
[09:17.760 --> 09:19.720]  is the first one is immobilized.
[09:19.720 --> 09:24.960]  And so mobilizing is when a soil organism holds a nutrient inside of its body.
[09:25.900 --> 09:31.380]  Remineralizing is when organic matter is broken down into its simple inorganic
[09:31.380 --> 09:35.400]  forms. And so we're talking about the capturing of nutrients inside of a
[09:35.400 --> 09:36.420]  bacterial body.
[09:36.780 --> 09:43.420]  We're talking about large compounds being broken down into amino acids and basic
[09:43.420 --> 09:44.500]  inorganic compounds.
[09:46.300 --> 09:53.260]  And essentially, they're just trying to say, you know, what happens on a nutrient
[09:53.280 --> 09:56.160]  standpoint when all these combinations get together.
[09:56.160 --> 10:02.440]  So in this study as well, they also measured contents of nitrogen and phosphorus in
[10:02.440 --> 10:05.560]  the plant itself, the above ground biomass.
[10:05.920 --> 10:08.120]  And they also measured in the soil periodically.
[10:08.720 --> 10:15.320]  But you can start to see that they've got many different combinations going on here.
[10:17.260 --> 10:18.280]  So that's why I had to back up.
[10:18.320 --> 10:19.640]  Let me back it up so I can get to my.
[10:21.200 --> 10:22.480]  So there's lots of different sections.
[10:22.480 --> 10:24.140]  Like I said, this is 22 pages.
[10:24.180 --> 10:28.300]  Most of these pages are talking about previous work, what they found and what they
[10:28.300 --> 10:30.500]  hope to find with this given study.
[10:32.500 --> 10:37.860]  Here's kind of a drawing of what happens when, you know, a bacterial feeding nematode
[10:37.860 --> 10:40.180]  eats a bacteria and kind of what that conversion is.
[10:40.220 --> 10:42.020]  It's a little bit confusing, honestly.
[10:42.040 --> 10:44.780]  But here's some other points.
[10:44.780 --> 10:49.860]  So this current study examines the interactions of the biota represented in the model in
[10:49.880 --> 10:53.920]  order to substantiate previous observations under more rigorously controlled conditions
[10:54.240 --> 10:57.400]  and with a more complex assemblage of organisms, including plants.
[10:57.760 --> 11:02.040]  Nitrogen and phosphorus mineralization were examined in two model soil systems, one in
[11:02.040 --> 11:07.080]  which soil was unamended and one in which chitin was used as a representative organic
[11:07.080 --> 11:08.160]  nitrogen substrate.
[11:08.920 --> 11:13.160]  Bacteria, fungi and nematode grazes of these microflora were chosen from isolates to
[11:13.160 --> 11:14.580]  represent functional groups.
[11:14.580 --> 11:16.740]  And so they're just kind of explaining what they're going to do.
[11:17.120 --> 11:19.920]  They explain the two sample groups.
[11:19.920 --> 11:22.920]  One is amended with chitin, one is not amended with chitin.
[11:23.360 --> 11:28.020]  And then of those two sample groups, they all have the same different assemblages of
[11:28.020 --> 11:30.180]  plants, which is described here.
[11:30.180 --> 11:32.760]  And so they have a sterile plant control.
[11:33.120 --> 11:39.520]  They have plant with bacteria, PB, plant bacteria and a bacterial feeding nematode, PBNB.
[11:40.080 --> 11:44.720]  Then you have plant and fungus, plant fungus and a fungus eating nematode.
[11:45.700 --> 11:51.620]  Each treatment was replicated five times and sampled after 40 days with a total of 100
[11:51.620 --> 11:57.100]  days sample. And so, you know, in a lot of these papers, they start to describe what's
[11:57.100 --> 12:01.940]  about to go down, all their different methods, which is usually what I like to read
[12:02.740 --> 12:04.540]  before I even get too much into the paper.
[12:04.540 --> 12:07.300]  I like to read what is it they were trying to do.
[12:08.380 --> 12:12.380]  And that'll usually determine if I bother reading it.
[12:12.520 --> 12:15.720]  But so then they start to get to the results.
[12:15.720 --> 12:20.920]  So they start to get into some of the data of the of the experiment itself.
[12:21.320 --> 12:24.080]  So, like I said, they measured the shoot and root biomass.
[12:24.080 --> 12:30.840]  And so at periodic times throughout the 105 days, they would clip off the above ground
[12:30.840 --> 12:32.200]  biomass of the grass.
[12:32.200 --> 12:36.480]  They would weigh it. They would separate the roots from the soil and weigh the roots,
[12:36.480 --> 12:37.480]  which is kind of interesting.
[12:37.980 --> 12:42.780]  And so here they're saying shoot production, meaning the above ground grass biomass, was
[12:42.780 --> 12:46.780]  significantly higher in treatments with bacterial feeding nematodes or with fungus than
[12:46.780 --> 12:50.020]  in the sterile plant control or in a plant and bacteria treatment.
[12:50.420 --> 12:55.660]  In addition, the most biologically complex treatment, so plant, bacteria, fungi, bacterial
[12:55.660 --> 13:01.460]  feeding nematode and fungal feeding nematode, had more shoot biomass than all of the other
[13:01.460 --> 13:06.460]  treatments. And root production was significantly higher in the plant with fungal
[13:07.360 --> 13:10.320]  treatment than any other treatment, which is actually kind of interesting.
[13:10.320 --> 13:16.840]  And so throughout this entire study, there was different times in the 105 days and with
[13:16.840 --> 13:20.000]  different assemblages of organisms that different outcomes happened.
[13:20.040 --> 13:24.360]  And so, you know, you know, they had the greatest above ground biomass with the most
[13:24.360 --> 13:29.720]  complex treatment, but root production seemed to be higher in the plant and fungi, you
[13:29.720 --> 13:33.720]  know. And so from that, as somebody that was reading this, it says, OK, this is a
[13:33.720 --> 13:38.640]  correlation back to my hydroponic days where, you know, if the fungal component of the
[13:38.640 --> 13:44.780]  soil is increasing oxygen and root zone and pore space, then that allows for greater
[13:44.780 --> 13:47.980]  root growth, just like in a hydroponic system that has more aeration.
[13:47.980 --> 13:53.400]  And so, you know, a lot of this was starting to really kind of like unravel some things
[13:53.400 --> 13:58.180]  that were misunderstood for me and and, you know, where to go from there.
[13:59.140 --> 14:00.340]  There's a lot of tables here.
[14:00.340 --> 14:07.400]  These tables are speaking about they actually went through and measured the organisms
[14:09.800 --> 14:12.480]  in the root zone and then outside of the root zone.
[14:12.480 --> 14:22.480]  So they actually quantified, you know, how many organisms were at different places in the
[14:22.480 --> 14:28.180]  soil. This is where I really started to get turned on to nematodes and where I could find
[14:28.200 --> 14:33.120]  them and where we could introduce them into the cultivation space back in 2015, 2016, when
[14:33.120 --> 14:37.600]  we were doing this. And they found that both treatments that included nematodes had
[14:37.600 --> 14:41.320]  significantly higher bacterial numbers than the treatment with only bacteria.
[14:41.760 --> 14:45.600]  And the highest bacterial densities were in the plant bacteria and bacterial feeding
[14:45.600 --> 14:49.680]  nematode, which is kind of interesting because further down in this paper, it actually
[14:49.680 --> 14:56.880]  explains how a nematode eating bacteria actually can lead to higher populations of
[14:56.900 --> 14:59.100]  bacteria, which is really fascinating.
[15:00.540 --> 15:05.180]  They go on to explain why they think that was part of it is they carry them around
[15:05.180 --> 15:06.420]  through different resources.
[15:06.420 --> 15:11.420]  Not all the bacteria die inside the nematode, but it just, you know, to me really showed
[15:11.420 --> 15:14.500]  there's some wild, wild things that go on with the soil food web.
[15:19.340 --> 15:23.220]  And so here is saying that all treatments with bacterial feeding nematodes or fungi
[15:23.240 --> 15:28.080]  contain significantly more ammonia nitrogen, which is the bloom formula, than the
[15:28.080 --> 15:30.040]  sterile plant control or just plant bacteria.
[15:30.040 --> 15:35.080]  And so showing again that there's some benefits to trying to make the soil food web
[15:35.400 --> 15:37.720]  assemblages more complex.
[15:40.520 --> 15:43.640]  So here's the thing about chitin, a lot of people know about chitin or chitinase
[15:43.640 --> 15:49.280]  products in the chitin amended or well, I guess it says in all treatments with the
[15:49.300 --> 15:54.820]  chitin decomposer. So the fungi, you know, root root biomass was always greater than in
[15:54.820 --> 15:56.260]  the treatment without the organisms.
[15:56.580 --> 16:00.580]  We're seeing an impact on root growth by adding some of the beneficial fungi.
[16:03.620 --> 16:11.860]  Let's see. There's a bunch of different graphs, so they did shoot biomass, which in
[16:11.860 --> 16:13.620]  my other slides, I have a little clean up version.
[16:13.640 --> 16:21.080]  Sometimes it's hard to read because you got to sort out through the different symbols for
[16:21.080 --> 16:26.120]  each thing. And so here's shoot biomass, root biomass across the different timelines.
[16:31.400 --> 16:35.480]  More graphs, so this is hyphal length and then they were doing some staining of the
[16:35.480 --> 16:45.400]  hyphae. So then they started measuring the nutrients in the soil in this particular
[16:45.660 --> 16:48.420]  study, they did nitrogen and phosphorus.
[16:49.460 --> 16:54.300]  And it says all plant treatments immobilized P, meaning phosphorus was inside
[16:54.300 --> 16:59.420]  organism bodies with the least immobilization in the sterile plant and plant with just
[16:59.420 --> 17:04.900]  bacteria and the most rapid initial mobilization in the plant bacteria and bacterial
[17:05.380 --> 17:11.740]  feeding nematode. And so you're seeing a more rapid absorption and containment of those
[17:11.740 --> 17:14.020]  nutrients when they added a bacterial feeding nematode.
[17:15.020 --> 17:20.360]  By the end of the experiment, however, the plant values were similar for these different
[17:20.360 --> 17:23.240]  assemblages. When I finally got the opportunity to meet Dr.
[17:23.240 --> 17:27.160]  Lane and sit down and have some beers over dinner with her, I asked her some of these
[17:27.160 --> 17:32.520]  things and essentially what they found was they were trying to grow grass in a petri dish
[17:32.520 --> 17:33.880]  over 105 days.
[17:33.880 --> 17:37.120]  And so some of that stuff leveled out towards the end of experiment.
[17:37.280 --> 17:42.460]  When I asked her about that, she said, if you did this in a larger soil volume, then some
[17:42.460 --> 17:45.960]  of these things that equaled out at the end definitely wouldn't equal out at the end.
[17:45.960 --> 17:50.560]  But in respect to be an appropriate scientific study, you know, they put they put that
[17:50.560 --> 17:57.080]  stuff in there. What was interesting then, too, is you see a variation of when some of
[17:57.080 --> 18:02.040]  these nutrients start to become available in the different assemblages of organisms.
[18:02.040 --> 18:03.220]  That's what this is talking about.
[18:03.220 --> 18:08.440]  So ammonium nitrogen increased slightly between days 9 and 21 in the uninoculated
[18:08.440 --> 18:11.520]  control and then remained constant for the rest of the experiment.
[18:13.440 --> 18:19.040]  Meaning more nitrogen wasn't being produced in that sample without organisms.
[18:19.040 --> 18:24.100]  And so, you know, if you happen to catch Brandon's last episode where he was talking
[18:24.100 --> 18:28.400]  about the differences between the Malik three test and the saturated paste test, he was
[18:28.400 --> 18:32.920]  mentioning that because of the introduction of his phosphorus solubilizing organisms,
[18:33.120 --> 18:37.840]  you're seeing an increase of available phosphate on the saturated paste test when it
[18:37.840 --> 18:40.000]  might not be showing up on the Malik three.
[18:40.900 --> 18:43.980]  And so that was kind of an interesting thing that I think the study is seeing as well.
[18:55.410 --> 19:01.090]  And so the most they saw the most rapid immobilization, so the most rapid creation and
[19:01.090 --> 19:06.490]  containment of nutrients within an organism body happened where there was something
[19:06.490 --> 19:07.650]  eating something else.
[19:07.690 --> 19:11.370]  So we have a plant bacteria and a bacterial feeding nematode.
[19:11.370 --> 19:15.010]  And then we have a plant bacteria, fungi and fungal feeding nematode.
[19:15.390 --> 19:21.030]  And so you're seeing a lot of flowering nitrogen being produced when something is
[19:21.030 --> 19:22.230]  eating something else.
[19:25.270 --> 19:31.230]  Hey, Scott, just a quick question from the peanut gallery, Sharon asked, did the chitin
[19:31.230 --> 19:34.110]  impact nematode population in Elaine's study?
[19:36.830 --> 19:39.190]  You know, I have to go through and read this.
[19:39.190 --> 19:45.230]  Mostly what it talked about was increasing available nutrients and increasing
[19:45.250 --> 19:46.250]  available biomass.
[19:47.090 --> 19:51.170]  I could read some of these a little bit more specifically and then drop those in the
[19:51.170 --> 19:52.010]  comments after.
[19:52.730 --> 19:57.090]  There was a lot of there was a lot of talk about effects with nematodes.
[19:57.930 --> 20:01.690]  There's probably two pages, just two full pages talking about the impacts of
[20:01.690 --> 20:05.810]  nematodes. But right off the top of my head in this moment, I don't know that I have the
[20:05.810 --> 20:12.490]  answer for that. But here's one, it says, you know, the most significant increases in
[20:12.510 --> 20:18.190]  available flowering nitrogen plant growth and plant available nitrogen occurred when
[20:18.190 --> 20:20.630]  bacterial feeding nematodes or fungi was present.
[20:21.150 --> 20:26.390]  So it didn't necessarily say that there was an increase here, but it's saying that the
[20:27.750 --> 20:29.470]  the effects of the increase of fungi.
[20:29.470 --> 20:33.430]  So the fungi are producing the ammonia, nitrogen or the flowering nitrogen.
[20:33.430 --> 20:38.750]  Those are being increased when something is eating something else.
[20:39.750 --> 20:45.650]  And then so this is just an interesting thing where they took from previous research and
[20:45.650 --> 20:49.770]  talked about what all these different organisms do, which is kind of interesting, which I
[20:49.770 --> 20:52.570]  think Brandon was talking about in the last episode, too.
[20:52.570 --> 20:57.730]  Like you're seeing CO2 respiration, you're seeing movement of nitrogen, phosphorus.
[20:57.730 --> 21:03.450]  And so here's a lot of times in these peer reviewed studies, they'll do full work
[21:03.450 --> 21:05.730]  sided of anything they read or incorporated.
[21:05.730 --> 21:10.710]  And so that's what this is all about with respect to the different organisms they had in
[21:10.710 --> 21:18.640]  the sample. There's one more here.
[21:21.280 --> 21:27.060]  And I think this is where, like I really, you know, things for me really started to click
[21:27.060 --> 21:32.320]  and really this was where I became quite obsessed with the soul food web essentially.
[21:32.320 --> 21:37.740]  But so now here they're talking about increases in nitrogen and phosphorus in the short
[21:37.740 --> 21:43.520]  term, unamended study. There was net in some net nitrogen immobilization, meaning
[21:43.520 --> 21:48.660]  no increase in the plant and plant bacteria treatments as the plants took up the
[21:48.660 --> 21:54.240]  limited available nitrogen in the soil while little to no nitrogen was being created
[21:54.240 --> 21:58.300]  or mineralized. And in the treatments with fungi and or bacterial feeding nematodes,
[21:58.300 --> 22:03.020]  however, there was more nitrogen mineralized than the plants could take up, even though
[22:03.020 --> 22:06.400]  there was a greater and more rapid plant growth in these more biologically complex
[22:06.420 --> 22:12.080]  treatments. And so this paragraph told me, you know, the basis for why Dr.
[22:12.080 --> 22:16.160]  Lane makes some of the claims that she makes, not necessarily saying that I agree with
[22:16.160 --> 22:20.060]  them, but this is based in why she makes the claims that mineral analysis and mineral
[22:20.060 --> 22:24.680]  mending isn't needed is because here we have a situation where bacterial feeding nematodes
[22:24.680 --> 22:30.100]  were introduced and far more nitrogen than could be taken up in the plant was
[22:30.100 --> 22:36.060]  produced. And that's pretty profound, you know, saying that, you know, even though
[22:36.140 --> 22:39.260]  nitrogen was going into the plant, they were measuring it in the plant.
[22:39.580 --> 22:42.460]  There was still far more produced than even the plant was taking up.
[22:42.460 --> 22:45.380]  And it showed an increase in the soil.
[22:45.380 --> 22:48.420]  And so here they're talking about nitrogen released by the nematodes.
[22:49.100 --> 22:53.600]  It says while appreciable N was released by nematodes in the plant bacteria, bacterial
[22:53.600 --> 22:57.540]  feeding nematode treatment, the amount was insufficient to explain all the early
[22:57.540 --> 23:01.980]  increase in plant nitrogen as compared with plants from the plant bacteria treatment.
[23:02.460 --> 23:08.220]  For example, on day 21, 647 micrograms of nitrogen were found in plants from the plant
[23:08.220 --> 23:13.180]  bacteria and bacterial feeding nematode treatment, while plant bacteria plants contained
[23:13.180 --> 23:17.940]  175 micrograms of nitrogen, a difference of 472 micrograms.
[23:18.780 --> 23:23.460]  By this time, only 269 micrograms nitrogen had been released by the nematodes.
[23:23.940 --> 23:26.220]  So they're saying something else has to be going on here.
[23:27.260 --> 23:30.380]  And I think it's fair in some of these scientific studies to say that they found
[23:30.380 --> 23:33.460]  something, but they don't necessarily have the answer.
[23:33.460 --> 23:40.020]  And so their theory is that, you know, for the additional nitrogen uptake by the plant,
[23:40.020 --> 23:41.660]  several factors should be considered.
[23:41.700 --> 23:47.660]  First, the bacterial populations on day 21 were 25 times greater in the plant bacterial
[23:47.660 --> 23:51.460]  bacterial feeding nematode treatment than in just the plant bacteria alone.
[23:51.820 --> 23:56.100]  And so when they went through periodically through the study, they were counting soil
[23:56.100 --> 24:02.580]  organisms and they saw 25 times more bacteria when there was a grazer or something that
[24:02.580 --> 24:05.380]  eats it in that treatment, which is pretty interesting.
[24:07.700 --> 24:10.540]  And so the cation decomposition, then they're making an assumption that cation
[24:10.540 --> 24:14.260]  decomposition by bacteria was probably much greater in the treatment with the nematodes.
[24:14.980 --> 24:19.140]  Second, since both bacteria and nematodes were concentrated in the rhizosphere, so in
[24:19.140 --> 24:23.300]  the root zone, much of the nitrogen mineralized by either bacteria or nematodes was
[24:23.300 --> 24:28.820]  probably in close proximity to the roots available for immediate uptake, which makes
[24:28.820 --> 24:32.100]  sense, right? So the organisms are living in the rhizosphere or on the roots.
[24:32.580 --> 24:36.340]  They're eating each other, which is releasing nutrients, and it's available for immediate
[24:36.340 --> 24:42.660]  uptake. This more advantageous nitrogen regime was probably reasonable or responsible for
[24:42.980 --> 24:48.380]  more rapid root growth in the early plant bacteria bacterial feeding nematode treatment.
[24:48.860 --> 24:53.580]  The greater root biomass was then able to exploit a larger soil volume and reach soil
[24:53.580 --> 24:57.500]  inorganic nitrogen not available to the roots in just the plant bacteria treatment.
[24:58.300 --> 25:02.180]  This was primarily responsible for the differences between these treatments in ammonia,
[25:02.180 --> 25:07.260]  nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen levels, which were not which were noted in the first half of the
[25:07.260 --> 25:12.300]  experiment. Therefore, it seems likely that the Pliodera species, so the bacteria they
[25:12.300 --> 25:16.580]  inoculated with, had an important positive feedback early in the experiment.
[25:17.460 --> 25:22.100]  Root biomass between the two treatments was no longer different at day 49, yet plants in the
[25:22.100 --> 25:27.780]  plant bacteria bacterial feeding nematode treatment contained 813 micrograms more N than
[25:27.780 --> 25:34.780]  those in the plant bacteria treatment. By this time, nematodes excreted 1491 micrograms of
[25:34.780 --> 25:40.260]  nitrogen per ecosystem or petri dish, which may have accounted for much of the additional
[25:40.260 --> 25:45.220]  plant nitrogen that they measured, although some of the nematode excreted nitrogen was
[25:45.220 --> 25:48.900]  undoubtedly taken up or immobilized by the bacteria.
[25:49.940 --> 25:54.180]  This paragraph right here sent me on a crazy mission for bacterial feeding nematodes, which
[25:54.740 --> 26:01.060]  back in 2015-2016, it just was very difficult to come into those.
[26:02.420 --> 26:09.300]  So yeah, so it's pretty interesting stuff. I don't know if any of that made sense to everybody
[26:10.100 --> 26:15.620]  or if it helped, but I guess for me, what this did for me on my journey was it showed there was a
[26:15.620 --> 26:23.220]  tremendous value to putting something into the system to eat anything else, whether it be a
[26:23.220 --> 26:30.580]  bacteria feeding nematode eating a bacteria or a fungal feeding nematode eating a fungi, which
[26:30.820 --> 26:41.460]  from the time I read this paper in like 2015-2016, it would be like three years before I would see
[26:41.460 --> 26:45.780]  an actual fungal feeding nematode in a client garden. It took a long time to get there.
[26:46.500 --> 26:49.700]  But what we found was you could order bacterial feeding nematodes on the internet.
[26:50.820 --> 26:58.180]  Most people are familiar with the Steiner-Nema predatory nematodes, so the SF and the SC
[26:58.180 --> 27:04.660]  nematodes. But if you get the heterobditis or the HB, those are very voracious bacterial
[27:04.660 --> 27:11.540]  feeding nematodes. Even though they're sold as a pest predator, they eat a ton of bacteria, which
[27:12.100 --> 27:17.220]  leads to a very measurable increase in yield, which we started seeing in the commercial space.
[27:17.220 --> 27:27.860]  And a lot of cultivators complain about the track and trace phenomenon,
[27:27.860 --> 27:33.780]  but track and trace told us a lot about our property because you're getting a per plant
[27:33.780 --> 27:40.740]  yield, you're getting a per zone yield. And we started getting hired early in 2016 because
[27:40.740 --> 27:47.220]  farms were using predatory nematodes to control pests. And then the track and trace would show
[27:47.220 --> 27:53.300]  there was an extreme disparagement between yield across the facility. And so a lot of those farms
[27:53.300 --> 27:59.300]  hired us to try and figure out why it was. What we saw was in the samples where your yield was
[27:59.300 --> 28:04.820]  considerably higher, there was a tremendous amount of the bacterial feeding nematodes that they were
[28:04.820 --> 28:12.260]  using as a pest control measure. And so that was some pretty light bulb moments for us back in the
[28:12.260 --> 28:18.340]  early years of really trying to figure out because at that time, suitable compost for this process
[28:18.340 --> 28:25.140]  really wasn't around. At that time, you had to make a thermal pile like Dr. Lane talks about
[28:25.140 --> 28:29.620]  to get some of these organisms. All the bagged compost was almost exclusively bacteria.
[28:30.180 --> 28:36.180]  There was a couple brands that might have some protozoa, some flagellate and amoebas, most often
[28:36.180 --> 28:40.980]  amoeba, which are one of the predators of bacteria, look like a millennium falcon, I guess.
[28:41.860 --> 28:45.620]  And so I was kind of on the search, like how do we get these things into the system?
[28:46.180 --> 28:51.380]  And at that time, by far the easiest way was to add the HB nematodes to the system.
[28:52.260 --> 28:59.860]  And then so now you're taking bacteria, which is the potential for plant growth or the storage
[28:59.860 --> 29:03.940]  of plant nutrients, and then you put something in there that eats it and it all becomes available.
[29:08.300 --> 29:14.300]  I'm looking in the, I'm going to throw some comments up and you guys can just either confirm
[29:14.300 --> 29:18.940]  or don says Blue Oyster mycelium will munch the nematodes.
[29:23.180 --> 29:24.620]  OK, it's a fair answer.
[29:30.670 --> 29:38.630]  And then it's so funny, the comments some of these clowns have for Elaine, it's like
[29:38.630 --> 29:42.470]  you don't need to put some respect on her name, like you're all talking shit on the
[29:42.790 --> 29:44.470]  you can't you can't read through that paper.
[29:45.750 --> 29:46.550]  That's this guy.
[29:48.870 --> 29:51.510]  Yeah, so I'm saying like, people are clowning.
[29:51.510 --> 29:52.230]  Get that out of here.
[29:52.790 --> 29:53.590]  Talking about science.
[29:55.430 --> 29:56.790]  Yeah, I'm blowing past.
[29:57.750 --> 30:01.430]  Yeah, he was talking about five different trophic types of nematode.
[30:02.550 --> 30:03.670]  Yeah, so totally.
[30:03.670 --> 30:03.910]  Yeah.
[30:03.910 --> 30:05.750]  So there's good and bad nematodes.
[30:05.750 --> 30:10.950]  But I believe the work that Dr. Lane says that the root feeding nematodes exist under
[30:10.950 --> 30:12.470]  decreased oxygen conditions.
[30:13.350 --> 30:16.390]  And so if we avoid that, then we avoid their habitat at all.
[30:17.110 --> 30:21.990]  And I would say in all of our cannabis experience, which has been a lot, you know, there's been
[30:21.990 --> 30:24.710]  less than five facilities that have root feeding nematodes.
[30:24.710 --> 30:30.230]  Normally you see those come in on soil brands that are made with municipal compost.
[30:30.790 --> 30:31.670]  But usually you don't.
[30:32.950 --> 30:37.910]  You don't see those too much in the soil, soil, soil mixes, honestly, we do see them,
[30:37.910 --> 30:38.870]  but very rare.
[30:41.350 --> 30:45.110]  As far as the blue oyster mycelium, we don't necessarily use the blue oyster.
[30:47.190 --> 30:50.950]  And there is a mushroom that that will catch nematodes.
[30:50.950 --> 30:55.350]  You know, it's always the one that shows like the it's like that the lasso around it, but
[30:55.350 --> 30:57.670]  that's catching root feeding nematodes.
[30:58.870 --> 31:03.110]  So I don't I don't know that the mycelium itself would kill the nematodes.
[31:04.550 --> 31:05.910]  But yeah.
[31:06.310 --> 31:16.310]  So what was you and Brandon had started talking about something when Brandon's video crapped
[31:16.310 --> 31:16.870]  out?
[31:19.830 --> 31:25.110]  Oh, yeah, well, I just I think like what's interesting is, you know, the different strategies
[31:25.110 --> 31:25.750]  that we've taken.
[31:25.750 --> 31:32.310]  So I've worked on organism assemblages and Brandon's worked on chemistry to to achieve
[31:32.310 --> 31:33.590]  the same net result.
[31:33.590 --> 31:37.510]  And so, you know, there might be some interesting similarities between the results that both
[31:37.510 --> 31:41.750]  of us have found from, you know, from two different strategies.
[31:44.150 --> 31:48.190]  I use biologicals.
[31:48.190 --> 31:55.230]  I inoculate weekly at the facility with probiotics, and I also do different combinations at certain
[31:55.230 --> 31:56.750]  times for certain effects.
[32:00.110 --> 32:05.870]  So my my kind of take on it, I'm not to be completely honest, I'm not a biologist.
[32:06.430 --> 32:10.590]  I'm not really familiar with Dr. Lange-Ingham's work.
[32:11.790 --> 32:15.870]  Haven't read a lot of her stuff or haven't taken any of her courses and stuff.
[32:15.870 --> 32:21.310]  I know who she is, obviously, you know, leader and a proponent of soil food web science.
[32:23.790 --> 32:31.070]  For me, I I started, you know, when I started doing organic cultivation and I was doing
[32:31.070 --> 32:33.470]  the probiotics, it kind of led from there.
[32:33.950 --> 32:43.230]  And then finding science that's applicable and functional is one of the things that's,
[32:43.230 --> 32:44.110]  I guess, the hardest.
[32:45.550 --> 32:50.590]  Because a lot of these studies, if you look at the methods of what they're doing, a lot
[32:50.590 --> 32:53.550]  of them are taking measurements from like field agronomy.
[32:54.270 --> 32:55.470]  And I've said this before.
[32:56.670 --> 33:01.710]  So you have to be able to try to translate how these things function in a modified system
[33:01.710 --> 33:06.990]  that's not actually soil, hasn't been weathered by nature, it doesn't contain sand, silt or
[33:06.990 --> 33:07.310]  clay.
[33:07.950 --> 33:13.790]  These things function very, very similar.
[33:14.430 --> 33:22.190]  But when you take away, you know, the abiotic stress factors by having a controlled environment,
[33:22.190 --> 33:30.670]  it's more like you're culturing like mushrooms, for instance, or culturing something in a
[33:30.670 --> 33:31.950]  bacterial incubator.
[33:31.950 --> 33:37.790]  Essentially, you're making a huge incubator for the type of biology.
[33:39.310 --> 33:45.710]  And I use a combination of the biologicals with the testing.
[33:45.710 --> 33:57.310]  And I know that most research that I've read will say that having a larger biodiversity
[33:57.310 --> 34:05.070]  of microorganisms will, it shows the best overall results.
[34:06.750 --> 34:14.830]  A lot of these are doing experiments with like field agronomy, in which case, you know,
[34:14.830 --> 34:22.590]  you can't create perfect environments or you can't create perfect like nutritional, like
[34:23.150 --> 34:27.070]  soil fertility targets to start with.
[34:27.070 --> 34:34.830]  So, you know, the stuff that I'm doing right now, it's really progressive because I have
[34:34.830 --> 34:37.870]  to make sure that I maintain balance within these systems.
[34:39.150 --> 34:41.950]  And I do use a lot of the biologicals.
[34:41.950 --> 34:49.550]  And until I can actually get, you know, testing done on what those are in the soil, then I
[34:49.550 --> 34:50.430]  won't know for sure.
[34:50.430 --> 34:53.870]  But I know 100% like what I'm inoculating with.
[34:53.870 --> 35:00.510]  I know that the bacteria I'm using, that source from, you know, biotechnology company, I know
[35:00.510 --> 35:04.990]  exactly what I'm putting into the system, what it's, you know, what the what it should be
[35:04.990 --> 35:05.550]  promoting.
[35:07.710 --> 35:12.430]  But I think without being able to genetically test these things, that it becomes kind of
[35:12.430 --> 35:19.470]  difficult, at least for me to know specifically, because I'm not so much relying on.
[35:19.870 --> 35:25.390]  Although the bacteria and the consortiums that I use, they do outcompete pathogens and
[35:25.390 --> 35:26.270]  cycle nutrients.
[35:26.270 --> 35:31.790]  I'm not solely relying on those to get the plant what it needs.
[35:32.510 --> 35:37.470]  I'm doing that by making sure that things are kind of balanced and that things when
[35:37.470 --> 35:41.230]  they fall in the solution are at a good a good number.
[35:42.830 --> 35:44.430]  Some of that is due.
[35:45.390 --> 35:49.870]  Some of those numbers are byproducts of the inoculations.
[35:51.870 --> 35:57.470]  But my main focus when it comes to biological crop steering, the method that I'm using is
[35:57.470 --> 36:01.870]  actually focusing on the metabolites of certain types of consortiums.
[36:03.150 --> 36:05.230]  Because that's really where you get the benefit.
[36:05.230 --> 36:11.870]  If you're getting an organism that's producing like an auxin compound, it's going to have
[36:11.870 --> 36:13.870]  a physiological effect on the plant.
[36:13.870 --> 36:14.590]  Itself.
[36:15.710 --> 36:25.950]  If you're getting microorganisms that create cyte of forests that are, you know, iron chelating
[36:25.950 --> 36:32.510]  compounds and you're making iron biologically available in soils, that's going to have a
[36:32.510 --> 36:37.550]  physiological effect on the plant because, you know, iron is one of the heaviest metals
[36:37.550 --> 36:41.550]  in soils and it's one of the hardest for the plant to accumulate.
[36:41.710 --> 36:49.950]  So there's, you know, I have an idea of what I want and if is more science emerges and
[36:49.950 --> 36:54.270]  I find out what type of metabolites are being produced by the different types of microbes.
[36:55.550 --> 36:58.830]  My question is, OK, this microbe is producing this.
[36:58.830 --> 37:03.950]  Does this microbe play nicely with these other microbes?
[37:03.950 --> 37:06.830]  And if the answer is yes, they do play nicely.
[37:06.830 --> 37:14.830]  Then I then I experiment to see if the end result is is better.
[37:16.910 --> 37:17.470]  Nice.
[37:17.470 --> 37:22.030]  I think one of the, you know, one of the things I really liked about your last episode was
[37:22.030 --> 37:26.670]  how you said that, you know, we need to take into account scientific research, but not
[37:26.670 --> 37:29.710]  all the stuff in vitro or in the lab, as they say.
[37:30.990 --> 37:34.190]  You know, translates well to the practical cultivation space.
[37:34.270 --> 37:40.670]  And so, you know, I think keeping a balance between what we read in a study in a petri
[37:40.670 --> 37:45.550]  dish we do in the real world, maintaining that balance is very important.
[37:46.830 --> 37:53.870]  I will say, though, like in our in our experience, you know, what what is an ecological monograph
[37:54.830 --> 37:58.670]  is, you know, translates to the real world quite well.
[37:58.670 --> 38:02.110]  As far as playing nice, we do see some weird things with competition like
[38:02.350 --> 38:10.510]  the SF, SC, so the Steiner Nema, predatory nematodes, heterodactyl nematodes.
[38:10.510 --> 38:15.550]  If you inoculate them at the same time, usually one of them lasts because they're competing
[38:15.550 --> 38:16.750]  for the same resources.
[38:16.750 --> 38:22.670]  And so when we really track these things over time in permanent soils, even though we inoculate
[38:22.670 --> 38:31.150]  with the SF or SC and always the HB, you do start to see one of those end up as the predominant
[38:31.150 --> 38:33.550]  species and then you start to re-inoculate again.
[38:34.990 --> 38:37.150]  That's how it is with the biologicals.
[38:37.150 --> 38:41.790]  And one of the reasons why I inoculate continuously, because I want them to be able to produce
[38:41.790 --> 38:46.030]  the same chemical compounds, but also because there's dieback.
[38:46.030 --> 38:51.950]  You know, these things as you know, as time persists, they'll go and they'll reach just
[38:51.950 --> 38:53.550]  kind of natural levels.
[38:53.550 --> 38:53.790]  Right.
[38:54.590 --> 39:01.070]  Unfortunately, some of these natural levels aren't going to facilitate the rapid growth
[39:01.630 --> 39:07.150]  of these plants, especially again, if you've taken out the abiotic stress factors and your
[39:07.150 --> 39:14.990]  VPD is on point and everything is dialed in as far as your environment goes, you have
[39:14.990 --> 39:16.030]  proper lighting.
[39:16.030 --> 39:23.630]  If everything is fully dialed in, right, the growth rate that I have always seen
[39:23.630 --> 39:29.390]  is that the plant needs a little bit more.
[39:29.390 --> 39:35.070]  Now, the soils will feed these things for the majority of the inputs, but things like
[39:35.070 --> 39:45.870]  calcium get used so quickly because calcium is, you know, it carries so much of the other
[39:45.870 --> 39:51.630]  elements with it when it's absorbed, you know, when the plant uptakes these from the soil.
[39:51.630 --> 39:54.430]  So calcium is depleted really, really rapidly.
[39:54.990 --> 39:56.110]  So is potassium.
[39:56.110 --> 40:04.030]  And, you know, potassium is one of the things that, you know, it has to be mineralized into
[40:04.030 --> 40:05.390]  a form that's usable.
[40:06.190 --> 40:13.710]  And unless in a lot of times I see really low potassium levels because the amount of
[40:13.710 --> 40:16.190]  potassium that cannabis requires.
[40:16.910 --> 40:26.510]  And so there are certain types of species that will help, you know, make those biological,
[40:26.510 --> 40:32.030]  they'll mineralize them, break them down, make them available.
[40:34.670 --> 40:37.470]  But not at the speeds that I see that.
[40:37.470 --> 40:45.230]  So, you know, for me, being able to know that, like, you know, I have the soil test, right,
[40:45.230 --> 40:50.030]  and I can see what's in the soil, like, okay, this could be low or it could be adequate,
[40:50.030 --> 40:56.030]  but it's not really until I see how it falls in the solution that I can see, okay, well,
[40:56.030 --> 40:59.950]  I could actually use a little bit more in the soil because it's not, you know, falling
[40:59.950 --> 41:05.630]  into solution or, you know, some things are available, are better available when your
[41:05.630 --> 41:09.550]  VPD is in better range or, you know, lower ranges, higher ranges.
[41:09.550 --> 41:18.110]  The availability of some of the nutrients are going to be dependent on the ability for
[41:18.110 --> 41:22.190]  that to continually transpire, you know?
[41:22.190 --> 41:22.910]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani Right.
[41:22.910 --> 41:26.910]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani So there's all these different factors that
[41:26.910 --> 41:27.470]  play in.
[41:27.470 --> 41:33.310]  So it's—for me, it can be really hard to determine and that's why I've been building,
[41:33.310 --> 41:37.550]  like, constant data sets over the last year for the target levels.
[41:37.550 --> 41:40.990]  We have the soil at Majestic Craft Cannabis.
[41:43.070 --> 41:50.750]  It is at a level where everything is at target range and all the focus is really just dialing
[41:50.750 --> 41:58.670]  in—I mean, balancing everything and then dialing in through the tissue testing because
[41:59.550 --> 42:06.030]  I can see how it falls in solution from the soil and I can see how the plant is actually
[42:06.030 --> 42:10.830]  absorbing it and if the levels are adequate or not enough and little things—little
[42:11.390 --> 42:17.870]  tweaks can actually be made just with—like, the amount of minerals that we're actually
[42:17.870 --> 42:22.830]  talking about when I'm talking about, like, top dressing and adding these minerals in,
[42:24.510 --> 42:34.190]  we're talking about, like, such a minute amount, you know, teaspoons or tablespoons per yard
[42:34.910 --> 42:35.630]  of soil.
[42:35.630 --> 42:42.270]  So if you have an entire yard of soil, you might only be using two teaspoons of a mineral.
[42:43.710 --> 42:44.910]  We're not talking a lot.
[42:44.910 --> 42:51.310]  We're talking about really small, minute adjustments to maximize, you know, these things'
[42:52.590 --> 42:57.710]  potential, you know, and make sure that things aren't going above, too.
[42:57.710 --> 43:05.150]  So, you know, I think that it will be possible in the future to be able to make adjustments
[43:05.150 --> 43:12.270]  like that using biology, but what we're going to have to focus on is the different consortiums
[43:12.270 --> 43:14.350]  that release those metabolites.
[43:14.350 --> 43:17.470]  Like, because one of them, for instance, is phosphatase, right?
[43:17.870 --> 43:30.670]  It's an enzyme, and it breaks down minerals that are phosphorus.
[43:30.670 --> 43:32.910]  It breaks down phosphorus from minerals, you know?
[43:34.110 --> 43:41.390]  There's other things like, you know, reductase compounds or, again, sidiophores or different
[43:41.390 --> 43:46.670]  type of organic acids and amino acids that act as chelation compounds.
[43:46.670 --> 43:56.190]  I think, if I'm not mistaking, I think glutamic acid, one of the amino acids is very, very
[43:56.830 --> 44:03.550]  it's an extremely, extremely strong binding agent, and so the induction of amino acids
[44:03.550 --> 44:04.910]  is one of the things that I'm using, too.
[44:06.670 --> 44:14.510]  Well, I'm doing more, it's very different types of microbes, and then I'm able, since
[44:14.510 --> 44:20.110]  I already have my slow fertility on point with all the testing, I can dial in the cultivars
[44:20.110 --> 44:25.710]  to see where they are, and after I have all those data sets, I can just run everything
[44:25.710 --> 44:27.950]  with basically an SOP.
[44:27.950 --> 44:34.030]  Like, if I start at this point at the very beginning, I'll know that on a weekly schedule
[44:34.030 --> 44:39.550]  I'll need to introduce these types of biologicals at this point, I'll need to mineralize at
[44:39.550 --> 44:44.590]  this point, or I'll need to add, you know, whatever it might be.
[44:46.750 --> 44:52.270]  But then I can actually look, you know, my end goal would be I'd love to be able to find
[44:52.270 --> 45:02.350]  out exactly which organisms work best synergistically together, so that way you can, so we can continue
[45:02.430 --> 45:10.190]  to decrease the inputs, just maximize the cycling capacity of oils at different points
[45:10.190 --> 45:11.390]  for the different things.
[45:11.390 --> 45:19.470]  If we know that we need, you know, a little more, like, boron or something, okay, what
[45:20.190 --> 45:25.550]  do we know of anything that is going to be able to solubilize that or make that more
[45:25.550 --> 45:28.510]  bioavailable, and then those things.
[45:28.510 --> 45:30.590]  So those are the focus.
[45:30.590 --> 45:36.750]  Like, if I know I need something when we have proper tools to get just a little thing instead
[45:36.750 --> 45:39.390]  of adding a mineral, can we have biological?
[45:39.390 --> 45:44.510]  And those are kind of, you know, what can I do to keep improving?
[45:44.510 --> 45:50.750]  And it's being able to translate the papers, that's been the thing, that's been one of
[45:50.750 --> 45:54.670]  the most difficult things because there's a lot of good work, a lot of good research,
[45:54.670 --> 46:00.350]  it's all about, but it's all about does this actually function?
[46:00.350 --> 46:08.030]  Does it have functionality in a cultivation system for cannabis at scale, right?
[46:08.030 --> 46:17.710]  Because if you can, like, let's say you're a cannabis farmer, a legacy cannabis farmer,
[46:17.710 --> 46:23.470]  an investor comes to you, and they come say, hey, we want this, but we have X amount of
[46:24.030 --> 46:31.790]  being able to decrease the cost, it's huge, especially, so you might be spending a bit
[46:31.790 --> 46:41.870]  of money on testing for doing the soil, that, but you're literally like putting out, dude,
[46:42.590 --> 46:48.270]  thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars on the cost of, but it's to cultivate,
[46:48.670 --> 46:53.630]  you're resoiling continuously, all these things that go along with it.
[46:54.190 --> 47:01.390]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani, just quick, yeah, hold that up, and then I was gonna cut your
[47:01.390 --> 47:05.150]  video so that your audio comes through better, but what—hold it up.
[47:05.150 --> 47:09.550]  Yeah, we can't really see it, but—
[47:09.550 --> 47:11.230]  Aaron Alexander Yeah, what does it say?
[47:11.950 --> 47:15.070]  Brandon Grimm This is a study of biostimulant
[47:15.070 --> 47:22.910]  action of protein hydrolates on their effects on plant physiology and microbiome.
[47:22.910 --> 47:29.470]  It's a really, really good research, and this is one of the reasons why I actually
[47:29.470 --> 47:33.950]  don't worry about any type of nitrogen source other than the acid nitrogen.
[47:33.950 --> 47:37.310]  Evan Brand Just quickly, Brandon, can you kill your
[47:37.310 --> 47:41.790]  video for a little bit so that your audio is getting all the bandwidth?
[47:41.790 --> 47:44.830]  Brandon Grimm Yeah.
[47:44.830 --> 47:47.470]  Evan Brand And—
[47:47.470 --> 47:49.710]  Brandon Grimm Can you hear me all right?
[47:49.710 --> 47:50.830]  Evan Brand That is much better.
[47:50.830 --> 47:51.550]  Brandon Grimm Yeah.
[47:51.550 --> 47:54.590]  Brandon Grimm I didn't know that was streaming in the background,
[47:54.590 --> 47:55.470]  so that might—
[47:55.470 --> 47:59.550]  Evan Brand You had what streaming in the background, the show?
[47:59.550 --> 48:04.430]  Brandon Grimm No, my macaw was streaming in the other room.
[48:04.430 --> 48:05.390]  Evan Brand Oh, got it, got it.
[48:06.190 --> 48:08.190]  Brandon Grimm He can be really loud when he wants to be.
[48:09.790 --> 48:21.150]  One of the interesting things about the amino acids is it not only stimulates plant morphology,
[48:21.870 --> 48:24.430]  but it also stimulates the biome.
[48:24.510 --> 48:38.510]  I have found the combination of amino acids and biology just has a massive, massive impact.
[48:38.510 --> 48:39.790]  It's night and day.
[48:39.790 --> 48:41.070]  You can see it visually.
[48:42.990 --> 48:51.630]  One of the things I think is a lot of times I think people run out of energy towards the
[48:52.590 --> 48:57.870]  end of their cycles because a lot of people start off nitrogen, and what I've seen is that
[48:57.870 --> 49:05.870]  you have to have a certain—if you cut off that availability, I think we've all seen that
[49:06.750 --> 49:08.670]  right with the bucket that's overflowing.
[49:08.670 --> 49:15.630]  Once you have one thing that's not in balance or level, it can only progress far.
[49:17.230 --> 49:18.830]  I think that's one of the things.
[49:19.150 --> 49:25.950]  When you think about acid nitrogen, it's really interesting because what you're going to plant
[49:25.950 --> 49:32.830]  is a biological amino acid that's available, and then that byproduct of this amino acid
[49:33.870 --> 49:41.070]  hydroxylation process is a biological form of nitrogen that's immediately available.
[49:41.070 --> 49:45.870]  Immediately available for foliar sprays, and then you're also getting the acids.
[49:45.950 --> 49:52.350]  Then when you're—I always—if you're giving the amino acid that's going to biosynthesize
[49:52.350 --> 49:56.990]  anyway, it's going to expend less energy, and it's going to have more energy for
[49:58.110 --> 50:00.030]  other metabolic processes.
[50:04.430 --> 50:12.750]  I'm working on my office here together, and I'm putting together all of the research papers that
[50:12.750 --> 50:20.430]  are kind of a pull to Canvas. I'm going to put them in my Dropbox, that Dropbox public for me.
[50:22.030 --> 50:25.470]  But it's going to take me a little while because I have to start reading out.
[50:30.190 --> 50:37.710]  Another thing too is things that I tried to research a lot of times, it's something that I
[50:37.710 --> 50:44.030]  don't see is modified growing mixes or like living soils. I don't see a lot of science coming out of
[50:44.910 --> 50:52.670]  that are geared that were just for these modified growing mixes. The reason is
[50:52.670 --> 50:58.990]  I think is because these things are fairly new because of the rise in cannabis agriculture.
[50:59.630 --> 51:05.630]  There's more interest being taken, so I think that as we move forward, there's going to be a lot more
[51:05.630 --> 51:13.470]  science on these types of mixes and how they function, and hopefully I can bring you
[51:13.470 --> 51:19.790]  get some of that science. But again, a lot of this stuff is just transferring over science
[51:20.510 --> 51:22.990]  that's in these spaces.
[51:23.390 --> 51:24.430]  Functionality is key.
[51:26.350 --> 51:36.510]  Just quickly, Brandon, can you quit and start your phone up, guys? Your audio is super
[51:36.510 --> 51:44.910]  robotic, but as someone said, it's the smartest robot that they've heard. What was the comment?
[51:44.910 --> 51:46.910]  It's a very smart sounding robot.
[51:46.910 --> 51:49.470]  If you have somebody playing video games or something, the next
[51:49.550 --> 51:51.550]  room over or something, have them cut it all off.
[51:51.550 --> 51:53.550]  That happens to us.
[51:53.550 --> 51:55.550]  You just need to get back to work and stop playing video games.
[51:55.550 --> 52:01.550]  Exactly. That always happens with Eric. His kids play the video game, it cuts out.
[52:01.550 --> 52:03.550]  Okay, so I turned off my Wi-Fi.
[52:03.550 --> 52:05.550]  There you go.
[52:05.550 --> 52:07.550]  Do I sound all right?
[52:07.550 --> 52:13.340]  You sound much better. All right, now you can even bring the video back if you want.
[52:13.340 --> 52:15.340]  Go back to amino acids.
[52:15.420 --> 52:23.420]  I actually have a bunch of papers that I have prepared because I have a booth set up for
[52:23.420 --> 52:31.420]  Bokashi or Dwarfs at the Cowboy Cup out here in Oklahoma. I have a bunch of stuff. If you're
[52:31.420 --> 52:39.420]  in Oklahoma and you're going to go out there, come see me. One of the things that I've been
[52:39.500 --> 52:49.500]  One of the things that is coming really clear to me after going through hundreds and hundreds
[52:49.500 --> 52:57.500]  of papers is that it seems like bacteria kind of drives all living systems. Not just what's
[52:57.500 --> 53:05.500]  in the soil, but also what's on the phylosphere, what's in the endophagic bacteria. It's because
[53:05.580 --> 53:10.540]  they have the ability to create chemical compounds in the plant that can be utilized. They have the
[53:10.540 --> 53:20.540]  ability to change DNA coding. They just do all kinds of insane, crazy things. A lot of the
[53:21.180 --> 53:25.740]  functions of a lot of these different types are just being discovered.
[53:25.900 --> 53:35.340]  So one of the funnest things for me is to be able to find all the cool new stuff that's been
[53:35.340 --> 53:43.580]  discovered and see if it translates into anything that I'm doing. Because again, my whole goal is
[53:43.580 --> 53:50.300]  to be able to show people and showcase organic cultivation and say, hey, look, this is a more
[53:50.300 --> 53:58.860]  cost-effective method. And it is, in my opinion, a higher, you can create a higher quality as far as
[53:59.980 --> 54:07.500]  the complete overall profile of the plant when we talk about terpenes, cannabinoids, flavonoids,
[54:08.460 --> 54:16.380]  and the other things. Okay. So biostimulant action of protein hydrolysates. It talks about how
[54:16.940 --> 54:22.940]  the different protein hydrolysates actually stimulate the microbiome to help diversify things.
[54:29.180 --> 54:33.500]  It has a lot of different functions. So a lot of these amino acids chelate things and make things
[54:33.500 --> 54:38.860]  more biologically available, things that may not have been there. They increase biological activity,
[54:38.860 --> 54:42.460]  at least for a certain period while these things are being sequestered, which will
[54:43.340 --> 54:49.180]  help kind of drive the nutrient cycling. And we're talking about not just in these modified
[54:49.180 --> 55:00.620]  mixes, but this is for agronomic field conditions as well. And so the continual use of these things,
[55:00.620 --> 55:08.220]  they can actually help build up biomass in the form of biology, right? And what'll end up happening
[55:08.220 --> 55:13.740]  is these things will peter out, they'll die, they'll break down. Anything that they had stored
[55:13.740 --> 55:20.460]  in their bodies, like you talked about before, will essentially become bioavailable. They also,
[55:21.900 --> 55:29.020]  you know, when you can get a nitrogen source that's so readily available, it helps increase
[55:29.020 --> 55:34.620]  root biomass of the different plants as well, which is going to help increase the aeration content.
[55:34.620 --> 55:42.940]  And that's going to increase the gas exchange in these types of soils as well. So if, you know,
[55:46.060 --> 55:52.620]  these are, and they're really interesting too, because these amino acids,
[55:53.980 --> 56:00.860]  they not only have these properties that are associated with them, but a lot of them
[56:00.860 --> 56:07.900]  can be used to build up larger complex protein chains, you know, and a lot of them can be
[56:09.340 --> 56:15.020]  turned into other chemical compounds. You know, some of these are precursors to
[56:18.140 --> 56:25.740]  things like hormones, you know, that might be secreted. And here's an interesting thing too. So
[56:25.820 --> 56:33.100]  some of the metabolites that are secreted by these bacteria and fungi, by all these
[56:33.100 --> 56:41.660]  soil microorganisms, some of these things, you know, are hormones as well too that have
[56:41.660 --> 56:47.580]  physiological effects that are being, you know, that are, you know, being introduced into the
[56:47.580 --> 56:56.700]  plant system. So it's been shown that these really help, that amino acids help with germination,
[56:58.300 --> 57:06.220]  plant growth and productivity, crop, not just yields, but actual quality. And it's mostly due
[57:06.220 --> 57:13.500]  to the, again, I think it's really due to the fact that when you give something, you know,
[57:13.500 --> 57:18.860]  something that it's going to already use that expend energy to create and you get to it readily,
[57:18.860 --> 57:23.020]  it's going to be able to focus on its other processes elsewhere.
[57:26.300 --> 57:29.180]  So it's been shown to have, you know, better quality
[57:31.100 --> 57:39.980]  produce as well as higher yields using the amino acids, the hydrolysates. And then the
[57:40.700 --> 57:49.180]  plant associated microbiome, you know, the increase in biology is exponential when it
[57:49.180 --> 57:54.460]  uses things. And it's not only that, but we go into like, for instance, you know,
[57:55.500 --> 58:03.100]  soy hydrolysate has 19 of like, I think, 20 or 21 essential amino acids for all life.
[58:03.820 --> 58:09.020]  And then we get into like specific amino acids like glutamate, which is the one that I was
[58:09.020 --> 58:17.820]  thinking of earlier. And that is one of the highest chelation and bonding capacities. So
[58:17.820 --> 58:23.580]  it can really, really help make so much stuff that's in the soil bioavailable. It's very
[58:23.580 --> 58:32.460]  similar to the way that humic and fulvic acids work. So there's another one. This is another
[58:32.460 --> 58:41.420]  paper on amino acids, and it's called, it's titled exogenous glutamate rapidly induces the
[58:41.420 --> 58:49.740]  expression of genes involved in metabolism and the fonts. And they talk about this and they're
[58:49.740 --> 58:56.380]  going over, you know, obviously, these aren't cannabis papers, right? So I look across the
[58:56.380 --> 59:03.340]  board. And a lot of times, if something is trying to, you know, some, some of these are specific
[59:03.340 --> 59:12.700]  to specific crops. But if we look at the way that nature functions, a lot of things, these are
[59:13.340 --> 59:20.460]  verbal, or at least I believe that a lot of these things are transferable in just the way that they
[59:20.460 --> 59:27.580]  operate. So, you know, certain amino acids will do different things. There's another one called
[59:27.580 --> 59:33.340]  amino acids, catabolism in plants, and it's the ability for these plants to sequester and taking
[59:33.340 --> 59:39.500]  these amino acids and build them into complex proteins, the things, you know, some of the
[59:40.380 --> 59:46.860]  terpenes are, you know, the precursors, they have to, you know, they have to be amino acids first,
[59:47.340 --> 59:52.380]  they're built in different, you know, carbon, carbon blocks, and then they're, they go through
[59:52.380 --> 59:58.940]  all these different chemical changes within the plants. amino acids really help facilitate a lot
[59:58.940 --> 01:00:07.900]  of the different, you know, catabolism and building blocks of all the different functions
[01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:13.740]  in there. So, I mean, if I'll have all these available, but a lot of these talks about, you
[01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:24.940]  know, you know, pool sizes of protein, protein bound proteins and amino acids in plants, they
[01:00:24.940 --> 01:00:31.100]  talk about pathways, the different pathways that the different chemical constituents take and what
[01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:35.900]  they're, you know, converted into what chemicals, you know, because we know that these plants
[01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:41.580]  produce wide, that plants produce wide range of chemical constituents, you know, so, you know,
[01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:47.740]  having the ability to have all these different amino acids available, I think just broadens the,
[01:00:47.740 --> 01:00:55.100]  the ability for the plant to make a lot of these chemical constituents more efficiently.
[01:00:58.420 --> 01:01:04.260]  Here's one, like proline, right, that's an amino acid, it acts as an osmolite and a chemical
[01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:09.540]  chaperone and is therefore accumulated by plants under various stress conditions.
[01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:16.900]  Its catabolism takes place in the mitochondria and the processes via two oxidation steps to
[01:01:16.900 --> 01:01:23.940]  glutamate. Proline, proline dehydronase converts proline to another chemical, which is also
[01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:31.940]  produced by the transmutation of orthiamine and, you know, it talk, it, so they're talking about
[01:01:31.940 --> 01:01:38.020]  these different, they're talking about all these different chemical reactions within the plant and
[01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:45.620]  then it eventually oxidizes to what's called P5C, then to glutamate, which is another amino acid.
[01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:54.500]  Amino acid, again, that glutamate is, is one of the highest chelated compounds, but there's all
[01:01:54.500 --> 01:02:01.860]  types of amino acid, acids, you know, there's, there's so many of them, dude, that, and they all
[01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:07.380]  have different functions and they all can be catabolized and turned into so many different
[01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:15.700]  things. That's what's, that's what's amazing about, about these things. And, so what's really
[01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:24.820]  interesting is this, this particular paper on amino acids isn't geared toward anything in particular.
[01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:31.620]  It's just talking about the pathways in plants and it gives you like the molecular breakdowns
[01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:35.780]  that are happening in these plants. And it says, Hey, what does this turn into this? What does this
[01:02:35.780 --> 01:02:41.060]  turn into this? And if you look at some of the chemical compounds that these are turning into,
[01:02:41.060 --> 01:02:47.060]  I know from doing other research that these are all the, the starting, the starting points for,
[01:02:47.060 --> 01:02:53.060]  for, for like different cannabinoids, different terpenes, you know, so you get to a certain place
[01:02:53.780 --> 01:02:59.620]  or not just for those in particular, but different flavonoids, just different things that can increase,
[01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:08.660]  you know, the, the quality and the functionality as a whole. If that makes sense.
[01:03:10.340 --> 01:03:15.140]  What, what was the spark that caused you to start diving into some of the scientific literature?
[01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:18.660]  Like, where were you at in the brain journey? You were like, we got to find some different
[01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:22.100]  shit than the homies know. Well, I had to, I didn't have a choice.
[01:03:23.060 --> 01:03:28.900]  I've been doing this for a really long time. Right. And it's like, so I was like, I was on PFA
[01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:34.020]  probiotic farmers Alliance, probably in the really early days, maybe they had like two or 3000 people
[01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:39.220]  on, on that page on Facebook at the time. And I was doing soil, but I was still using like house
[01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:43.940]  and garden. And I was, this was a time where prices in California were just dropping. And I
[01:03:43.940 --> 01:03:48.580]  was like, dude, I have to like, I'm not going to go get a fucking job, like working for somebody
[01:03:48.580 --> 01:03:54.260]  else. I'm not gonna go pump concrete. I'm not gonna go hang drywall like fuck. So my option
[01:03:54.260 --> 01:04:01.620]  was I needed to figure out exactly how, what I needed to do to lower my costs. And my biggest
[01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:12.420]  cost at that time was my electricity and my inputs. And so I switched out my lights. I went from HPS
[01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:18.900]  to 315 CMH metal, ceramic metal halides. And I started researching, you know, what I needed to
[01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:24.260]  do. I started looking at all these different ingredient labels, right. And saying, well,
[01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:27.940]  what is this dry from this? Well, what's Langdonite? Well, Langdonite only costs,
[01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:36.500]  you know, $15 for a 50 pound bag. And I'm paying fucking, you know, $85 for a liter of it,
[01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:40.180]  you know, whatever it might be. So it was just like, this is getting out of hand. And so I just
[01:04:41.060 --> 01:04:46.020]  delve in and I just started reading every fucking ingredient that was on the shelf. I just started
[01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:51.860]  figuring out what was in it. And then I still wasn't fully organic at that point, but I was
[01:04:51.860 --> 01:05:00.500]  decreasing my cost. And then my partner, my mentor got me into growing. He's an OG. He's been growing
[01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:05.460]  indoor since 92. He was like, I'm going for organic, kid. I'm going for it. And I was like,
[01:05:06.260 --> 01:05:10.820]  fuck it. I'm going to do it too. And I fucking switched out my whole system. And I was like,
[01:05:10.820 --> 01:05:14.580]  yeah, bro. Like, like a couple of weeks later, I told him, or like a month later, I'm like,
[01:05:14.580 --> 01:05:17.940]  yeah, switch out the whole system, blah, blah. He's like, oh, you did? I was like,
[01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:26.020]  I'll just fucking with you, dude. I was just, you know, I was like, ah, okay, well, whatever. So my
[01:05:26.020 --> 01:05:31.300]  first crop, it wasn't that good. The quality was good, but I didn't hit numbers or anything like
[01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:36.100]  that. And then I got turned on, you know, I was like, well, I can look at that old sub cool
[01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:42.020]  recipe that used to be back on the forums. And I looked that back up and I built that and I was
[01:05:42.020 --> 01:05:46.500]  like, it's good. It worked real, real well for like a single run, but then everything just seemed to
[01:05:47.620 --> 01:05:51.460]  shut down and I couldn't figure out what it was. And then I did this and then I started doing all
[01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:56.740]  vegan mix, doing vegan soil mix, like super soil mix. And it worked far superior. And then I just
[01:05:56.740 --> 01:06:02.820]  started playing with soil mixes. You know, I got to a point where I was doing the inoculations with
[01:06:02.820 --> 01:06:08.740]  the EM1 and doing Bokashi and using different bacterial inoculations and doing research.
[01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:16.340]  And I eventually got to a place, you know, I started my own Bokashi company. I just, you know,
[01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:21.380]  I just delve into it because I needed to have the information to be able to produce the highest
[01:06:21.460 --> 01:06:26.340]  possible quality I could. And what really changed for me was
[01:06:28.660 --> 01:06:34.740]  the results of the cannabinoid and terpene tests when I switched. Because I was testing
[01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:42.100]  independently at farm labs in San Diego before and after the switch from fertigation salts to
[01:06:42.100 --> 01:06:47.860]  organics. And it was a night and day difference. I mean, everything jumped. Everything jumped. And
[01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:54.580]  it was like, okay, well, you know, I'm going to keep doing this. I'm going to keep figuring out.
[01:06:54.580 --> 01:06:58.900]  It wasn't perfect. And I had real good yields. And I had some that weren't so good. And
[01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:06.660]  I found a system that works really, really well. And it really comes down to the fact that
[01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:14.820]  you can keep everything really consistent with the methodologies that I'm using. You can build
[01:07:14.820 --> 01:07:19.700]  an SOP based off of a certain variety that you're going to grow. If you know you're going to be
[01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:26.100]  growing something consistently, you can build an SOP based off of all of those numbers. And then
[01:07:27.140 --> 01:07:31.700]  once you know that you have a consistent high quality product, where you're maxing out your
[01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:36.260]  numbers to like, as far as like my lights that I run, we're running 280, we're running
[01:07:36.740 --> 01:07:47.780]  480 watt LED boards, the 550s from Horticulture Lighting Group. And as far as the numbers are
[01:07:47.780 --> 01:07:52.980]  shown as far as U moles and everything, we're pretty much maxed out. I don't know if we can
[01:07:52.980 --> 01:07:58.980]  really get any higher yield capacity out of there. You know, our numbers are on point.
[01:07:58.980 --> 01:08:04.660]  We can get a little bit higher, but it's all going to be just cultivar specific at this point.
[01:08:04.660 --> 01:08:09.300]  Like some things are going to produce higher, even when they're maxed out, when we have all
[01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:14.820]  the data for the tissue testing. But then it's going to come down to again, some of these
[01:08:14.820 --> 01:08:20.740]  biologicals do some really amazing things. And it's just being able to dial in the effective
[01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:32.900]  microorganisms, also known as EM1, which I sell this, it's the same consortium as Micro Plus from
[01:08:32.900 --> 01:08:42.580]  my company. It's like, the way that it works, it's really amazing because it has so many
[01:08:43.300 --> 01:08:53.220]  different parts to it, right? It's nine different species. And not only that, but it actually does
[01:08:53.220 --> 01:09:02.420]  increase other organisms. It's probiotic. So it increases other things like the axiomycetes,
[01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:04.900]  I think that's how you pronounce it. I'm super bad with that one.
[01:09:05.460 --> 01:09:08.740]  The words are hard, man. You're doing great. You're doing great. The words are hard, man.
[01:09:10.740 --> 01:09:16.660]  And here's the thing. I'm not, you know, I didn't go to college either. So I try to explain this
[01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:22.980]  in ways that we can understand as growers, you know, because there's a lot of people who,
[01:09:24.420 --> 01:09:29.460]  like cannabis is growing bigger and bigger throughout other states are opening up. And
[01:09:29.460 --> 01:09:34.260]  there's a lot of people like myself who are still in the black market that potentially have
[01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:39.460]  opportunities, even if it means moving out of California or moving to different areas. And being
[01:09:39.460 --> 01:09:46.340]  able to have the type of data and the kind of platform that Peter provides where they can get
[01:09:46.340 --> 01:09:55.060]  this data is really going to be beneficial because I want to see more legacy farmers. I want to see
[01:09:55.060 --> 01:10:03.700]  more OGs, you know, getting, you know, into the money side, right? Because that's the only way to
[01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:09.300]  change it. If you want to change that big money, you have to put badass people like, you know,
[01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:14.340]  in those gardens, you know, who knows what, who can say, who can say to these people,
[01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:18.980]  hey, this is what needs to be done. You can do, you can do craft at scale,
[01:10:19.700 --> 01:10:26.820]  you know, it's not difficult. You just have to have like knowledge, you know, so I appreciate
[01:10:28.180 --> 01:10:34.580]  sharing. That's well said too, because what I've noticed and the reason why I first started
[01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:40.980]  getting into researching some of the stuff is a lot of the legacy growers got good at experiential
[01:10:40.980 --> 01:10:46.100]  science. So, you know, making a change to the cultivation space, observing the outcome and
[01:10:46.100 --> 01:10:51.540]  making adjustments. And so without the access to labs, without the ability to maybe look through
[01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:57.380]  scientific literature, they were able to combine things in a way that led to a desirable output.
[01:10:57.380 --> 01:11:03.380]  And, you know, for the traditional markets, that's fine. But, you know, based on my personal
[01:11:03.380 --> 01:11:08.900]  experience, once you go up into a certain scale, you have to know why you're doing something.
[01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:13.860]  And we work with a lot of cultivators. In my consulting experience, we've worked with a lot
[01:11:13.860 --> 01:11:18.340]  of consultants. And so we've worked underneath consultants to help them with the regulated
[01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:25.620]  transition. We've worked with large farms, we've worked with organizations. And at that scale,
[01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:30.580]  you have to know really why you're doing what you're doing, at least to a basic level, like
[01:11:30.580 --> 01:11:35.380]  you have built. So you've gone through the scientific research and you've found a why
[01:11:35.380 --> 01:11:41.380]  for the direction you're going. You know, you'd be shocked at how many farms we work with that
[01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:46.020]  get to be very large that are not doing even any measurement of their process, you know,
[01:11:46.020 --> 01:11:50.260]  whether they're hydroponic or living soil. You know, we work with a large number of hydroponic
[01:11:50.260 --> 01:11:55.300]  farms that never even do a nutrient analysis. And when we come in as living soil experts,
[01:11:55.300 --> 01:11:58.820]  we're teaching hydroponic people how to do drip and drain reports. We're teaching them how to
[01:11:58.820 --> 01:12:03.860]  balance nutrients. We're teaching how to get the trace minerals in balance with each other,
[01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:08.820]  with the macro micro elements. And, you know, I think for anybody that's in a traditional market,
[01:12:09.780 --> 01:12:12.580]  you know, it's understandable why they've been against some of the more,
[01:12:15.620 --> 01:12:18.740]  you know, kind of the science wing, I guess you could say, is because they've been
[01:12:19.380 --> 01:12:24.100]  outcasted and black marketed by different labs or blacklisted by different labs. And they've been
[01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:28.740]  disrespected. They've been treated in a really undesirable way. And that's built a resistance.
[01:12:28.740 --> 01:12:35.300]  By the legislators, let's make that clear though, too, because a lot of the times I know that here
[01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:41.700]  in Oklahoma, a home grower can't go to a lab and test. I can go to a lab and test with a license
[01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:48.820]  from the facilities that I either am partnered with or that I consult with, you know, but I
[01:12:48.820 --> 01:12:53.940]  couldn't do that. I can't go take my home grown, you know, and that it's like being able to being
[01:12:53.940 --> 01:13:04.580]  denied access to information. It's just wrong. It's wrong. It should never be in the legislation.
[01:13:04.660 --> 01:13:09.300]  I don't know. Agreed. Well, and it's the business's decision too, like as we've moved up in
[01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:14.020]  scale and gotten to larger and larger landscapes, you know, we've now had situations where buying
[01:13:14.580 --> 01:13:20.580]  acres worth of cover crop. And so now you go to a different distributor for that. And, you know,
[01:13:20.580 --> 01:13:25.060]  they'll do one or two transactions. And when they find out you're involved with cannabis,
[01:13:25.060 --> 01:13:29.620]  they just block you, you know. And so we've personally ran into situations where we're
[01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:35.860]  working in legal regulated markets with regulated facilities and we still get access issues with
[01:13:35.860 --> 01:13:40.740]  certain agricultural products. Some labs won't deal with you or they talk to you like you're
[01:13:40.740 --> 01:13:44.020]  an asshole. And if you do that, then I just won't, you know, I won't use you.
[01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:51.540]  There's protocols that you're going to have to usually abide by. A lot of times you don't want
[01:13:51.540 --> 01:14:01.540]  to disclose your tissue material because hemp is legal. Cannabis isn't, but there's no differential
[01:14:01.540 --> 01:14:06.500]  factor between the two. And if that thing doesn't have any THC present in the tissue,
[01:14:08.180 --> 01:14:12.820]  you're golden, right? You don't need to label it as cannabis, you know, just put
[01:14:13.700 --> 01:14:19.140]  sour cheese bear, you know what I mean? They don't know what that is, just or SCB. You just label it
[01:14:19.140 --> 01:14:24.020]  with whatever it is. There's a lot of stupid stuff like that, that you have to go around.
[01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:29.860]  But I wanted to touch on something that you said too. If you don't have a facility, a farm, if you
[01:14:29.860 --> 01:14:39.540]  don't have focus on what your outcome is, then you better get together, right? Because I like for me,
[01:14:39.540 --> 01:14:45.860]  I know what me, my partners all want. Like we have consistent product. It has to be consistent.
[01:14:45.860 --> 01:14:49.780]  The marketing, you have to have marketing. You have to have a budget for marketing.
[01:14:49.780 --> 01:14:56.740]  You have to be able to, you have to be able to connect with your consumer as a brand because
[01:14:56.740 --> 01:15:02.820]  they're so, as cannabis grows, you need to be able to distinguish yourself as a brand,
[01:15:03.940 --> 01:15:10.340]  which means that if you don't have SOPs, if you don't have focus, if you don't have meetings with
[01:15:10.340 --> 01:15:15.140]  everybody that you're working with regularly, and everybody's not on the same page, if things
[01:15:15.140 --> 01:15:19.300]  aren't written down and you don't have a direct plan of action for every process,
[01:15:20.820 --> 01:15:25.220]  you're probably going to fail. And that's one of the things that I tell people, look,
[01:15:25.220 --> 01:15:30.820]  you have to have a plan of action. It's not just about quality testing and consistency. It's about
[01:15:30.820 --> 01:15:36.100]  having good team members. It's about having good lines of communication. All these things are super
[01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:41.620]  important, especially when you're scaling, because if you're not communicating properly with the
[01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:45.540]  people who are back there in those gardens taking care of them and they don't know what to look for,
[01:15:46.180 --> 01:15:50.500]  they're going to miss that spider mite, those spider mites that are starting to creep up.
[01:15:50.500 --> 01:15:56.420]  Or they're going to miss the powdery mildew that might be coming in. Or they're going to miss the
[01:15:56.420 --> 01:16:00.580]  fact that they're not watering this room enough or that this certain cultivar has
[01:16:01.540 --> 01:16:05.860]  different nutritional needs that need to be addressed. There's all these different factors
[01:16:05.860 --> 01:16:10.260]  that could, that these what ifs, what ifs, and if you don't have proper lines of communication,
[01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:16.420]  you're going to fail. Yeah. Well, you're saying that we need to put a stake in the ground
[01:16:16.420 --> 01:16:21.220]  somewhere and we need some level of measurement to know if we're off track. And I think that's,
[01:16:21.220 --> 01:16:27.140]  yeah, exactly. SOPs, baby. I think that's the biggest lack in the traditional market and people
[01:16:27.140 --> 01:16:32.740]  from the traditional market moving into the regulated space is as you move up in scale or as
[01:16:32.740 --> 01:16:39.060]  you move into regulation with different testing, you find a lot of holes in your game. And you need
[01:16:39.060 --> 01:16:45.060]  to be able to choose a direct, know why you're going there and have some level of quantification
[01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:51.620]  to keep you inside the field of play. And historically, a lot of the traditional growers,
[01:16:51.620 --> 01:16:58.740]  like I said, they're graded experiential science, but without some level of functional understanding
[01:16:58.740 --> 01:17:03.380]  of chemistry and mineral balance, you don't need to be a chemist, but you need to know,
[01:17:03.380 --> 01:17:08.660]  like you found out, what's a target on a saturated paste test. You need to know what those targets
[01:17:08.660 --> 01:17:13.780]  are. You need to have some sort of strategy for quantifying your process to know when you're
[01:17:13.780 --> 01:17:20.100]  outside of those parameters. And then how to get those back. Like how much do you want me to be
[01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:25.700]  able to get back to those levels and not overdo it? Because here's the thing. When we're talking
[01:17:25.700 --> 01:17:32.180]  about these minute quantities of minerals, it is really, really to overdo it in these systems and
[01:17:32.180 --> 01:17:37.460]  throw them off. I mean, one of the biggest things that I see and one of the things that probably a
[01:17:37.460 --> 01:17:44.100]  lot of people might not understand is that the buildup over time of using bad water that has
[01:17:44.100 --> 01:17:52.100]  sodium and chloride in it just completely decimates systems. Completely. And there's a reason, right?
[01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:58.260]  Sodium has such antagonistic properties with other minerals. It's because it has such a high
[01:17:58.260 --> 01:18:03.780]  cation. It's such a strong cation. The only thing I, one of the things that I know that is stronger
[01:18:03.780 --> 01:18:10.980]  than that is calcium. And that's why oftentimes an agronomist will recommend that you use something
[01:18:10.980 --> 01:18:17.060]  like gypsum, which is just a massive amount of calcium. And it's basically so they can break
[01:18:17.940 --> 01:18:24.260]  those bonds on the sodium to those surfaces that they're bonded to.
[01:18:25.140 --> 01:18:29.060]  Right. Well, and just even doing a nutrient analysis, a lot of the hydroponic growers
[01:18:29.060 --> 01:18:32.100]  that we work with, when we start doing a nutrient analysis of their process,
[01:18:32.980 --> 01:18:40.020]  you find astronomical levels of chloride, you find very high levels of sodium, and most often
[01:18:40.020 --> 01:18:45.220]  you find a dysfunctional balance of macro elements and micro elements and all that. And so
[01:18:46.020 --> 01:18:53.620]  getting those things in line is really important. And knowing what the goal is, or at least
[01:18:53.620 --> 01:18:57.860]  knowing where you're at. We don't know how to move forward unless we're able to know where we're at.
[01:18:58.820 --> 01:19:06.580]  Yeah. What does that mean? That because of these, because of the way that they function,
[01:19:06.580 --> 01:19:11.860]  the plant is going to take them up. It kind of doesn't really have a choice. So then you create
[01:19:11.860 --> 01:19:19.220]  imbalance within the material itself. And that's a lot harder to adjust than, I mean, you can't
[01:19:19.220 --> 01:19:23.940]  really adjust imbalance. If you have something that's just way out of this, or if it's completely
[01:19:24.900 --> 01:19:30.740]  is disproportionate in the tissue, most of the time it's not going to recover.
[01:19:33.540 --> 01:19:40.020]  Right. Very good. Oh, hey, so check this out. Back to the amino acids, catabolism, and plants,
[01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:47.140]  there's a really neat graph in here. And it talks about possible energy yield. And this is one of
[01:19:47.140 --> 01:19:53.380]  the things that brings me back to the thing about when I talk about potential energy, because a lot
[01:19:53.380 --> 01:20:01.060]  of the times the plant is having to release a lot of this energy in the form of exudates, right? So
[01:20:01.060 --> 01:20:06.740]  it's using all these, this photosynthetic energy to create compounds that it's going to eventually
[01:20:06.740 --> 01:20:13.060]  release into the soil system to balance it, maybe change pH, maybe make something a little more
[01:20:13.060 --> 01:20:19.940]  available. So that's one of the things that, that a plant will dump. Sometimes up to 85%
[01:20:20.660 --> 01:20:27.140]  of its photosynthetic energy is converted into exudates, so it can change its soil environment.
[01:20:27.700 --> 01:20:34.260]  So that's why balancing out those environments and having proper soil pH, proper nutrient cycling
[01:20:34.260 --> 01:20:42.660]  capacity, having things really balanced will help reduce the amount of energy that they put into
[01:20:42.740 --> 01:20:51.460]  those, into that system. And therefore, it has more energy for, again, for more metabolic processes,
[01:20:52.020 --> 01:20:56.740]  like I always say, acquired resistance, just maximizing genetic potential.
[01:20:56.740 --> 01:21:04.660]  Here's a really interesting thing. So this, this, this science paper has a graph in here. And it's,
[01:21:04.660 --> 01:21:11.060]  says possible energy yield from complete oxidation of amino acids. So this has to do with
[01:21:11.060 --> 01:21:16.500]  one of the things that I talked to, talked on about in biological crop steering, which was
[01:21:18.100 --> 01:21:25.780]  redox and oxidation potential. So when these things are completely used up, they offer an actual,
[01:21:26.660 --> 01:21:32.660]  an amount of energy, right? And when we talk about energy and soil systems, we're talking about
[01:21:32.660 --> 01:21:38.020]  available energy that can be used by like microorganisms, for example, they need a certain
[01:21:38.020 --> 01:21:41.620]  ratio of carbon to nitrogen. We know that I'm sure you know that from,
[01:21:43.540 --> 01:21:54.100]  on doing soil classes and stuff. So what they're talking about is the NADH, the FADH2,
[01:21:55.140 --> 01:22:07.700]  and the ATP, that phosphorylation, phosphorylation cycles, which are basically energy currency
[01:22:07.700 --> 01:22:13.780]  for plants. It's how basically plants are able to do anything. It's like their fuel.
[01:22:14.340 --> 01:22:22.340]  So amino acids, each amino acid offers a potential, an energy potential. So when you bring
[01:22:22.340 --> 01:22:29.300]  in these amino acids into a plant, you're not only getting that nitrogen, you're getting the,
[01:22:29.300 --> 01:22:35.300]  the chemical constituent itself, but then you're also getting the energy potential that's associated
[01:22:35.300 --> 01:22:47.140]  with that. And it's all right here, like a triosine, NADH11, FADH2, 3, direct ATP is 2,
[01:22:48.180 --> 01:22:54.260]  ATP synthase through phosphorylation, the number's 34. So you're getting that many different
[01:22:54.260 --> 01:23:01.220]  molecules. And we, and if you understand how these cycles work, they exponentially
[01:23:01.540 --> 01:23:10.100]  increase with the availability of a fuel. Right. It's the energy system in the mitochondria. So
[01:23:10.100 --> 01:23:16.500]  the ATP to ATG conversion, so the adenosine triphosphate, and is in diphosphate,
[01:23:17.140 --> 01:23:20.580]  all that goes through the cells in the mitochondrion, what comes out as energy.
[01:23:21.780 --> 01:23:26.340]  Exactly. And so one of the things that, that potentially that we'll see
[01:23:27.060 --> 01:23:33.940]  is that we're going to see increase in like cytokine in production, which will increase cell,
[01:23:34.500 --> 01:23:40.500]  cell, you know, the time that cells reproduce, we're going to just see so much
[01:23:42.820 --> 01:23:50.900]  metabolic increase in energy, energy potential. I just, I don't know why there's not more talk
[01:23:51.300 --> 01:23:57.140]  about the energy potential that goes into these systems and how to utilize these,
[01:23:57.940 --> 01:24:02.900]  this energy potential through both redox, through both the induction of amino acids,
[01:24:02.900 --> 01:24:08.340]  and these, and what energy is being released with what micro and macro nutrients as well,
[01:24:08.340 --> 01:24:14.820]  because there's, there's an associated number of energy that goes with all of these, all of these,
[01:24:15.700 --> 01:24:21.780]  these chemicals, these minerals, these organic acids, and they're all potentially converted into,
[01:24:21.780 --> 01:24:28.340]  into the different processes that are making these systems function. So it's just, it's, I mean,
[01:24:28.340 --> 01:24:33.380]  some of this science is absolutely incredible, but if you're just looking at this paper,
[01:24:33.380 --> 01:24:37.060]  this is like a piece of a puzzle, right? What does this actually mean? You're going to need
[01:24:37.060 --> 01:24:41.460]  all the papers that go with it, the papers on redox and oxidation potential. You're going to
[01:24:41.460 --> 01:24:46.740]  need all the other ones that talk about all the individual amino acids and what they do in the
[01:24:46.740 --> 01:24:52.500]  plant. There's just, there's just so much. Here's another one, role of amino acids in plant response
[01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:59.860]  to stress. You know, these types, whether or not focusing specific on specific varieties can be
[01:24:59.860 --> 01:25:07.700]  used and translated to multiple species of plants, whether it's your cannabis or whether it's your,
[01:25:07.700 --> 01:25:13.860]  your gardens out outside in your backyard, you know, and the, the cool thing about these is
[01:25:14.820 --> 01:25:18.500]  sometimes you'll get really big papers, but if you just read the abstract
[01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:25.300]  and then you read the conclusion, you can get the gist of what most of these are talking about. And
[01:25:25.300 --> 01:25:29.940]  if you really want to delve into it and find out the processes of what they're doing and different
[01:25:29.940 --> 01:25:33.860]  results that, you know, then go through the stuff. But if you just want to kind of brief,
[01:25:34.500 --> 01:25:39.620]  like, and you're trying to find just things that might be relatable, you can usually find
[01:25:40.340 --> 01:25:45.700]  in the abstract and the conclusion of these papers. Right. Yeah. I think maybe too, you know,
[01:25:45.700 --> 01:25:49.940]  we're doing a live thing, but I think maybe once this gets posted, maybe make a comment on there
[01:25:49.940 --> 01:25:54.740]  and put the titles of these. I smile periodically cause I'm trying to watch the chat and some of
[01:25:54.740 --> 01:26:01.860]  the stuff's pretty funny, but they're cracking on my hairdo and shit, but we're ahead. Yeah,
[01:26:01.860 --> 01:26:09.140]  no, we, we, we, we've been, uh, her medic, uh, her medic, her mesh. She, uh,
[01:26:09.140 --> 01:26:17.460]  loosens has been diligently posting the PDFs on the discord. So I created a library, uh,
[01:26:18.180 --> 01:26:23.300]  channel on the discord, uh, where her mesh, she, uh, is, uh, yeah.
[01:26:23.300 --> 01:26:27.700]  And this is really interesting too. It's like, it says there's a part in here that talks about
[01:26:27.700 --> 01:26:34.260]  the effects of amino acids on membrane permeability and iron and ion transport.
[01:26:34.260 --> 01:26:41.540]  So again, we're talking about the, the ability for these amino acids to permeate the membranes
[01:26:41.540 --> 01:26:49.540]  of the cells of the roots and the, the leaf tissue and be able to help increase the transportation
[01:26:49.540 --> 01:26:57.380]  of all these nutrient element ions, you know, so there's just so much that goes with these systems
[01:26:57.380 --> 01:27:03.700]  as a whole. And, you know, so I try to, I've been focusing on more than just the biologicals,
[01:27:03.700 --> 01:27:09.220]  even though that is a huge proponent of it. But for me right now, if anybody wants to know what
[01:27:09.220 --> 01:27:15.380]  I view is I do weekly inoculations of the probiotics, which is like, I think it's seven
[01:27:15.380 --> 01:27:21.620]  or eight different species of bacillus, which includes bacillus subtilis, bacillus fermentarium,
[01:27:22.180 --> 01:27:33.140]  bacillus delbruchii, bacillus fermentarium, and then a couple others. There's the Saccharomyces
[01:27:33.140 --> 01:27:39.300]  cerviceae, and then there's the Rhydopsudomonas bluestrius, which is a interesting bacteria
[01:27:39.300 --> 01:27:44.500]  because it has four modes of metabolism. And it's also, it's photoautotropic. It can
[01:27:44.500 --> 01:27:51.300]  photosynthesize. It can borrow electrons from inorganic compounds. It can take electrons
[01:27:51.300 --> 01:27:56.500]  from organic compounds and living, other living organisms. It's a very interesting
[01:27:58.020 --> 01:28:03.780]  consortium of microorganisms. And then it also has the fermentative yeast. These really promote a lot
[01:28:03.780 --> 01:28:10.340]  of the soil microbes as well, but we're getting those in there as a pathogen suppression,
[01:28:10.900 --> 01:28:18.740]  nutrient cycling. It works as an amazing phosphorus cycler. It really helps increase the
[01:28:19.140 --> 01:28:31.060]  silica availability in the soils. And then I'm also using a very concentrated bacillus subtilis
[01:28:31.060 --> 01:28:39.460]  with the Trichoderma, Trichoderma hazarium. I don't know if that's right. There's a lot of
[01:28:39.460 --> 01:28:45.940]  research on those two as well. And across the board, it's kind of been shown across the board
[01:28:45.940 --> 01:28:52.820]  in almost all plant species that the benefits that you get from using the different combinations,
[01:28:52.820 --> 01:29:00.900]  again, for pathogen suppression, nutrient cycling, cytoforeproduction, biofilms. There's a lot of
[01:29:00.900 --> 01:29:07.140]  different things that these things can create. The organic acids, all the metabolites. Some of
[01:29:07.140 --> 01:29:12.660]  them are target specific antibodies that just kill off things that are similar to them that
[01:29:12.660 --> 01:29:22.740]  might be pathogenic to the plant. And then I also use the Boveria bossiana in the soil system as
[01:29:22.740 --> 01:29:30.660]  well. These consortiums all work and play really well together. However, the Boveria bossiana,
[01:29:30.660 --> 01:29:39.940]  Trichoderma, I really want to do more science to see how compatible they are because they're both
[01:29:39.940 --> 01:29:44.340]  different types of fungus. They have different functions. They have different food sources.
[01:29:44.340 --> 01:29:51.300]  So I don't see them having antagonistic relationship with each other because
[01:29:52.500 --> 01:29:58.500]  the Boveria bossiana really actually, it's parasitic to the insects. So it doesn't require
[01:29:58.500 --> 01:30:04.260]  the same nutritional requirements as the Trichoderma. So I just don't see it being a
[01:30:04.260 --> 01:30:08.820]  problem, but I'd like to really see if there's any type of relationship that I don't know of.
[01:30:10.820 --> 01:30:16.820]  So that's what I'm currently using, but there's more stuff coming. I discovered a couple more
[01:30:17.380 --> 01:30:25.060]  research articles on the cannabis microbiome. And one thing that made me think of this again
[01:30:25.060 --> 01:30:33.140]  was earlier when you were talking about how over a period of time, the biology and soils change.
[01:30:34.100 --> 01:30:43.700]  And it's not just even with the continual inoculation, the biology changes. The biology
[01:30:43.700 --> 01:30:53.940]  changes as the plant matures. There is a temporal spatial relation between the cannabis microbiome
[01:30:54.820 --> 01:31:01.300]  or I guess not just the, yeah, the entire microbiome, the endosphere, the phyllosphere,
[01:31:01.460 --> 01:31:07.940]  the rhizosphere. So it's going to be consistently changing as adapting as that plant ages. And I
[01:31:07.940 --> 01:31:14.420]  believe that's due to the fact that the plant is creating different chemicals constituents
[01:31:14.420 --> 01:31:19.860]  throughout its life and its nutritional needs kind of change. And I think that adaptation of
[01:31:19.860 --> 01:31:25.300]  the things that it's biosynthesizing and releasing into the soils and within itself, because again,
[01:31:25.300 --> 01:31:30.660]  some of these things are endophatic. And so even the endophytes change. And I think it's because
[01:31:31.940 --> 01:31:37.220]  the availability of what they have access to inside that plant changes, the availability of
[01:31:37.220 --> 01:31:44.580]  what the plant's giving the soil system changes. That's kind of my theory, I guess, understanding
[01:31:44.580 --> 01:31:51.300]  of how it works. Yeah. Well, it's definitely one aspect of it. The other aspect is all the
[01:31:51.300 --> 01:31:56.740]  other things that happen in the cultivation space. And so the work my wife and I worked together and
[01:31:56.740 --> 01:32:00.740]  we're both qualified to do the microscope analysis. So when we came into the commercial
[01:32:00.740 --> 01:32:05.460]  space, from my understanding, we did far more analysis than anybody else had done previously.
[01:32:06.100 --> 01:32:10.500]  And so, you know, a lot was really learned and we tracked a lot of facilities. And so,
[01:32:11.060 --> 01:32:14.260]  you know, there was facilities that we were working at full time that were large scale that
[01:32:14.260 --> 01:32:18.980]  we were tracking weekly for many months. And then there's clients that we've worked with that we
[01:32:18.980 --> 01:32:26.820]  tracked. What seems to be most impactful to the soil communities is either water volumes or
[01:32:27.540 --> 01:32:32.340]  feed volumes and then mulch layers also. So I'm speaking more like the living soil.
[01:32:32.900 --> 01:32:38.660]  You're doing more like a porosity medium, which is a little bit different, but it still has some
[01:32:38.660 --> 01:32:42.580]  of the same considerations. But when we track a facility from start to finish through a harvest
[01:32:42.580 --> 01:32:51.380]  cycle, most often the biggest dictator in what happens biologically is really water volumes,
[01:32:51.380 --> 01:32:56.580]  because a lot of the organisms we're after aerobic, like the EM1 you use are facultative
[01:32:56.580 --> 01:33:00.260]  anaerobes. They can kind of swing there like the I call them the transition team. They kind of
[01:33:00.260 --> 01:33:10.420]  handle that range. Yeah, so they're very suited to your situation. And when you start getting a
[01:33:10.420 --> 01:33:14.980]  larger soil volume, you get mulch layers, you get cover crop and all those things start to play in.
[01:33:16.100 --> 01:33:22.100]  Pretty much every farm we've worked with is using too much water from the standpoint of
[01:33:23.060 --> 01:33:27.780]  allowing oxygen in the root zone to allow these aerobic organisms to really proliferate. So what
[01:33:27.780 --> 01:33:32.180]  we see when we track a facility from start to finish, if it's a brand new soil mix gets thrown
[01:33:32.180 --> 01:33:38.660]  into a pot, we inoculate it and we start to track it. You can take our compost, which has very high
[01:33:38.740 --> 01:33:44.420]  levels of all the organisms considered biologically complete. You can inoculate that in a root zone
[01:33:44.420 --> 01:33:50.660]  and seven to 10 days later, take another sample and see what happened. What's interesting is you
[01:33:50.660 --> 01:33:57.380]  can inoculate with a certain population and ratio of organisms, but that's just part of it. It's the
[01:33:57.380 --> 01:34:02.100]  root zone water. It's the amount of feed that you're giving that determines what wakes up,
[01:34:02.100 --> 01:34:08.900]  what functions, what starts to actually proliferate. And that part, that whole part,
[01:34:08.900 --> 01:34:15.460]  I think is one of the most underestimated aspects of organic cultivation. You can read in the, I
[01:34:15.460 --> 01:34:18.820]  don't know if people watching after can see all the comments, but there's a lot of people kind
[01:34:18.820 --> 01:34:24.100]  of discounting some of the soil food web thing, which is pretty standard. But that comes from an
[01:34:24.100 --> 01:34:28.580]  extreme lack of understanding and experience with what we're talking about. And so it's hard to
[01:34:28.580 --> 01:34:34.660]  understand what's happening if you haven't been quantifying over time. And that's really mostly
[01:34:34.660 --> 01:34:40.900]  what we do. So we've seen a lot, a lot of times, you know, just making a slight change to watering
[01:34:40.900 --> 01:34:47.540]  makes dramatic efforts to increasing aerobic organisms, you know, and changing feed rates.
[01:34:47.540 --> 01:34:53.220]  And then finding the homeostasis between those two factors in a, in a more permanent soil system
[01:34:53.220 --> 01:34:57.300]  will definitely have profound effects on, you know, what wakes up because
[01:34:58.020 --> 01:35:04.980]  in, in biology, they're all very specialized. They operate under certain oxygen concentrations,
[01:35:04.980 --> 01:35:09.780]  certain water concentrations, and if it's not their conditions, then they go to go to sleep.
[01:35:12.420 --> 01:35:17.300]  And that's one of the things too. So one of the, one of the interesting things is a lot of these
[01:35:17.300 --> 01:35:22.980]  soil microbes, they have the ability to create endospores and encapsulate their DNA into,
[01:35:24.500 --> 01:35:33.060]  you know, into a space. And they're able to, you know, wait until the environments are right until
[01:35:33.060 --> 01:35:38.420]  they can start to proliferate and start to reproduce and go to job. But if they don't have
[01:35:38.420 --> 01:35:42.500]  the right food source or in the environmental conditions aren't right, it's just not going to
[01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:48.740]  happen. And I always say, and you're, I mean, you're absolutely correct. Hydrology, pH play a
[01:35:48.740 --> 01:35:54.980]  huge, huge part because if you're having constant fluxes in these systems, as far as the,
[01:35:56.660 --> 01:36:01.940]  the moisture content, it's going to, it's going to change the biology consistently.
[01:36:03.060 --> 01:36:08.180]  It's, you know, it's, there's nothing you can do to, to change that. If your soil dries out,
[01:36:09.060 --> 01:36:16.660]  it's going to cause, you know, I'm sure you've seen hydrophobic soil, you know, it's, it can be
[01:36:16.660 --> 01:36:24.980]  really hard to, you know, get that correct, you know, very quickly.
[01:36:25.700 --> 01:36:31.220]  Right. And that's, you know, when we're teaching, you know, pure living soil,
[01:36:32.900 --> 01:36:37.620]  a lot of times the hardest thing to communicate to a grower that's had success in other
[01:36:37.620 --> 01:36:43.620]  strategies is that the watering is different. And so in a, in a true permanent soil, living
[01:36:43.620 --> 01:36:49.620]  soil environment you know, watering to full saturation or watering to full runoff isn't
[01:36:49.620 --> 01:36:56.340]  necessarily ideal and letting a full dry back, which we've all been accustomed to and proven
[01:36:56.340 --> 01:37:01.540]  as a good strategy and other in other cultivation areas. But when you do that in living soil,
[01:37:01.540 --> 01:37:06.900]  every time it goes dry, or you let a full dry back happen, the organisms either go to sleep
[01:37:06.900 --> 01:37:13.220]  or they die off depending on how quickly that happened. So, so sometimes when you try to make
[01:37:13.220 --> 01:37:19.380]  the jump to a, to a full permanent living soil, if you stick with heavy saturations and dry backs,
[01:37:19.380 --> 01:37:24.500]  there's going to be problems biologically because all sorts of weird little nuances start to take
[01:37:24.500 --> 01:37:29.540]  place. And, you know, part of having a soil that's not hydrophobic is having a soil that's
[01:37:29.540 --> 01:37:35.860]  inoculated with organisms and then they maintain. And so the water holding capacity of a soil goes
[01:37:35.860 --> 01:37:42.180]  up, the better you get at maintaining adequate moisture levels to keep those organisms alive
[01:37:42.180 --> 01:37:47.620]  and thriving, which I think is... That'll also improve with your organic matter content
[01:37:48.980 --> 01:37:56.020]  of your soils as well. The, the holding capacity, you know, for me,
[01:37:57.540 --> 01:38:02.180]  aeration is super, super huge. And it's one of the reasons why even in most,
[01:38:02.420 --> 01:38:11.540]  in most commercial mixes that are available, I still add aeration to my mixes. And I do that
[01:38:11.540 --> 01:38:17.700]  because I want to completely saturate the soil, but I don't want runoff. And you're,
[01:38:18.580 --> 01:38:24.660]  right, you don't want runoff in these types of systems because if you're running something off,
[01:38:24.660 --> 01:38:31.380]  it means that you've taken something that is essentially, you have what, a bed or a pot,
[01:38:32.980 --> 01:38:37.140]  and you're letting all that stuff run out, which means that you're losing,
[01:38:38.820 --> 01:38:46.340]  you're losing vital minerals and nutrients that way. And you're trying to, the whole goal for,
[01:38:46.340 --> 01:38:55.140]  for us is to retain everything and balance that soil. So I don't, you know, I, I train and tell
[01:38:55.140 --> 01:39:04.020]  the employees that I work with, we want complete soil saturation, but we don't want runoff.
[01:39:04.020 --> 01:39:04.820]  Right.
[01:39:04.820 --> 01:39:10.660]  Now there are exceptions to the rules, right? Because if you got, if you're having some type
[01:39:10.660 --> 01:39:17.060]  of issue and you find out it's sodium, or you have something that's, that's too high,
[01:39:18.100 --> 01:39:23.140]  the only solution might be to flush, but then you're going to have to reamend and you're going
[01:39:23.140 --> 01:39:28.340]  to have to get those levels back up to proper after you've, you know, dealt with the issue.
[01:39:29.140 --> 01:39:33.620]  Right. I think it's important to define context a little bit too, with regards to the goal,
[01:39:33.620 --> 01:39:38.580]  because you know, the strategy that you've navigated to and found success with in commercial
[01:39:38.580 --> 01:39:43.060]  scale, I think the way you're watering is the most appropriate. So you've, you've added a lot
[01:39:43.060 --> 01:39:48.500]  of porosity, you've lightened up that soil. And then, so, you know, it's easy to get oxygen in
[01:39:48.500 --> 01:39:54.180]  and out of there. With the people that we work with in a more traditional, like kind of permanent
[01:39:54.180 --> 01:40:00.100]  living soil, we actually want to slowly bring that soil up to moisture and then try to maintain
[01:40:00.100 --> 01:40:06.340]  that moisture. And so when we track a facility from start to finish in a harvest cycle, using
[01:40:06.340 --> 01:40:16.100]  the microscope, we'll see a delay in establishment in organisms, and we'll see kind of like a glass
[01:40:16.100 --> 01:40:21.380]  ceiling on their increase. And so that if, if you have a cultivator that's fully saturating
[01:40:21.380 --> 01:40:27.060]  and fully saturating, and then allowing some level of a dry back from a biological standpoint,
[01:40:27.060 --> 01:40:32.580]  you're actually hindering organism establishment because it's too anaerobic for most of the things
[01:40:32.580 --> 01:40:38.340]  that we're inoculating with. And so in, in, in the context of a more permanent living soil,
[01:40:39.220 --> 01:40:45.460]  it seems best. See, I think it's different for me though, because right, I, I, you know, I do have
[01:40:46.420 --> 01:40:53.380]  a farm that I am owner of, a part owner of, and we're doing 85 foot long beds, two feet deep,
[01:40:54.180 --> 01:41:01.300]  and four foot wide, you know, and we're using the same type of very, very porous soil mix.
[01:41:03.380 --> 01:41:11.460]  But the difference I think is that, you know, for our, for our biological programs,
[01:41:12.420 --> 01:41:20.180]  we're not worried so much about promoting, you know, different, you know, I'm not,
[01:41:20.180 --> 01:41:27.540]  I'm not focusing on like making sure that it's, that, you know, like, okay, let me,
[01:41:27.540 --> 01:41:33.140]  let me start over. Okay. Let's take our biscular mycorrhizal fungi, like glomus, right?
[01:41:33.700 --> 01:41:40.420]  I don't inoculate with that. I don't inoculate my soils with things like the,
[01:41:42.020 --> 01:41:49.060]  azobacteria, right? Nitrogen fixing bacteria. I don't knock, I don't see a necessity for these
[01:41:49.060 --> 01:41:56.820]  things because these types of bacteria are geared for the facilitation of getting the plant
[01:41:56.820 --> 01:42:02.580]  something that it needs. But because I already know that the plant already has everything that
[01:42:02.580 --> 01:42:08.260]  it needs as far as, because I can see it, I can physically see it on, out as data.
[01:42:08.980 --> 01:42:15.700]  I really just want to try to promote the types of microorganisms that are going to be best
[01:42:15.700 --> 01:42:21.540]  for that type of system. And it's, you know, for me, it has been the, the foculative anterose,
[01:42:21.540 --> 01:42:27.620]  because the thing is, I don't have to worry about if, I don't have to worry about root pathogens,
[01:42:27.620 --> 01:42:33.540]  right? Because those types of conditions that might occur in these types of soils are going
[01:42:33.540 --> 01:42:39.780]  to be taken care of by these foculative anterose that are already present, you know, and then the,
[01:42:39.780 --> 01:42:46.900]  and then the, the, the trichoderma as well, you know, because these things, the types of microbes
[01:42:46.900 --> 01:42:53.700]  that I'm using will pretty much destroy a lot of the other ones, like outright. Like if you were to
[01:42:53.700 --> 01:43:02.900]  put these in a petri dish with other, other types of microbes, trichoderma is notorious for just
[01:43:02.900 --> 01:43:10.980]  ruining people's mushroom cultivation spaces, or it's notorious for ruining biological labs. It
[01:43:11.540 --> 01:43:16.260]  contaminates everything, right? It's because their, their ability to procreate and reproduce,
[01:43:16.260 --> 01:43:22.180]  they're very, very strong. That's what's special about these types of consortiums. I'm trying to
[01:43:22.740 --> 01:43:28.420]  use the best ones that are suited for agricultural purposes. And the reason why they're suited is
[01:43:28.420 --> 01:43:32.580]  because they're creating these compounds that are beneficial on the plant. And I don't, and then I
[01:43:32.580 --> 01:43:38.340]  don't have to worry about if my soil is anaerobic, or if there's a too much, a little, you know, if
[01:43:38.340 --> 01:43:43.540]  there's too, if it's too wet at the bottom, or like, you know, those things become less of a factor
[01:43:43.540 --> 01:43:50.660]  and an issue in these types of environments because you, you know, we have these types. And I know that,
[01:43:51.460 --> 01:43:59.780]  you know, a lot of the inoculants, they'll work, but again, you have to create a homeostasis for
[01:43:59.780 --> 01:44:04.900]  that. Because a lot of, like you said before, a lot of these biologicals are specific. You know,
[01:44:04.900 --> 01:44:10.660]  they have specific tasks, and they have, they operate at specific pH ranges, at specific
[01:44:10.660 --> 01:44:15.700]  hydrology levels, and all of those have to be conducive for them to be able to procreate and
[01:44:15.700 --> 01:44:21.460]  continue doing what they're doing. It's one of the reasons I just continue to inoculate with the EM
[01:44:21.460 --> 01:44:26.980]  and the trike, and the, and the bacillus, and the boob area, because it's just consistent across
[01:44:26.980 --> 01:44:32.660]  the board, guaranteed results from what I'm seeing anyway. I'm just getting it.
[01:44:33.940 --> 01:44:40.020]  Sure. Yeah, and it's, it's clear that you've, I think what's important to define is there's many
[01:44:40.020 --> 01:44:46.020]  ways to get towards a goal. And so you, you know, you've, you've found a strategy that works well
[01:44:46.020 --> 01:44:50.820]  for you, and with the combination of ingredients you're using, the watering strategy that you're
[01:44:50.820 --> 01:44:56.260]  using is working well. I do think it is important though to define a little bit, in the difference
[01:44:56.260 --> 01:45:00.580]  of my understanding of things, in that, you know, when you go through the Dr. Ling courses,
[01:45:00.580 --> 01:45:07.620]  she really breaks down a lot of the concepts of dissolved oxygen in the root zone. And so
[01:45:07.620 --> 01:45:12.660]  these facultative anaerobes, from my understanding, operate in four to six parts per million.
[01:45:13.220 --> 01:45:19.460]  All the very aerobic things happen above six parts per million. And so once you're in that four to
[01:45:19.460 --> 01:45:25.300]  six parts per billion or below, that is actually the range of dissolved oxygen that the pathogens
[01:45:25.380 --> 01:45:32.660]  do exist. And so, you know, you can't, you can have a successful cultivation strategy that's
[01:45:32.660 --> 01:45:38.980]  operating within that facultative, facultative anaerobic zone, but from a biological standpoint,
[01:45:38.980 --> 01:45:43.140]  the specialized organisms that are the root-borne pathogens happen within that range.
[01:45:44.180 --> 01:45:48.740]  And so when we get outside of that range by inoculating with a full soul food web,
[01:45:49.460 --> 01:45:55.780]  you know, meaning not just a few species of bacteria, you know, we're talking about bacteria,
[01:45:55.780 --> 01:46:02.340]  their predators, fungi, their predators, you know, there's a lot, there's a lot to,
[01:46:05.140 --> 01:46:10.500]  there's a lot more benefit that I think could be had. You know, and I think with your specific,
[01:46:10.500 --> 01:46:15.380]  with your specific situation, there's a little technique that we do called a protozoan
[01:46:15.940 --> 01:46:23.140]  soup or protozoan infusion. And essentially what you do is you use a given material. Yeah. Well,
[01:46:23.140 --> 01:46:31.140]  straw is one of them, right? So straws, grasses. I have like a alfalfa hay product that I use
[01:46:31.140 --> 01:46:39.460]  that's really consistent. And essentially what you do is you aerate that product and it provides
[01:46:39.460 --> 01:46:43.860]  oxygen. So the bacteria wake up, the bacteria start to grow. And then at a certain point,
[01:46:43.860 --> 01:46:48.900]  their predators wake up and start to grow. But if you get good with a microscope, you can time
[01:46:48.900 --> 01:46:55.380]  these things into a desirable population. And so you can actually manually increase the populations
[01:46:55.380 --> 01:47:03.940]  of the predator of bacteria. And then you can, you can make them shelf stable in a way, or you can
[01:47:03.940 --> 01:47:08.660]  use them. But if you were to add a protozoan infusion or a protozoan soup or whatever you
[01:47:08.660 --> 01:47:14.020]  want to call it, if you added that to your inoculum at like one to 3% dilution rate, I think
[01:47:14.020 --> 01:47:19.300]  you would be really blown away by the results. Especially during a time like when you're trying
[01:47:19.300 --> 01:47:25.620]  to stack nodes or something. So a lot of times people will use different nutrient strategies to
[01:47:25.620 --> 01:47:31.380]  stack the nodes during the first few weeks of flower. If you introduce some sort of predator
[01:47:31.380 --> 01:47:36.900]  prey interaction, there's not many things I've seen that match that growth response.
[01:47:37.540 --> 01:47:43.060]  You can also cause a problem. So if you introduce too many protozoa or the predators of bacteria,
[01:47:43.060 --> 01:47:46.820]  you can actually collapse the soil food web system, which is a really interesting concept.
[01:47:47.780 --> 01:47:52.180]  It's like throwing too many sharks in the tuna tank and all the sharks eat all the bacteria.
[01:47:52.980 --> 01:47:58.260]  But in the, in the sense of soil food web, you know, like you said earlier, the bacteria are
[01:47:58.260 --> 01:48:04.500]  the basis of that entire system. So if you overgraze them or over collapse them using this
[01:48:04.500 --> 01:48:09.220]  type of strategy, you actually collapse the entire soil food web, which is really fascinating.
[01:48:10.420 --> 01:48:14.180]  But I can, I can work one of those up and send it to you. I think you'd, I think you'd be really,
[01:48:15.460 --> 01:48:20.740]  with the context of the strategies you're taking, it would be really easy to execute and incorporate
[01:48:22.500 --> 01:48:26.740]  and put in there. And especially too, if you use like a bacterial feeding nematodes. So I'm not
[01:48:26.740 --> 01:48:33.780]  sure if you're using, most people end up with the SC or the SF nematodes, which are good and they do
[01:48:34.820 --> 01:48:38.260]  what I understand. They, they do do a little bit of bacterial feeding, but like,
[01:48:38.820 --> 01:48:45.460]  holy moly, you cannot match what you can do by just adding some HB nematodes. That's just crazy.
[01:48:45.460 --> 01:48:51.540]  Legitimately some of the first large scale living soil facilities that hired us, it was simply
[01:48:51.540 --> 01:48:57.300]  because, you know, they had been using this type of nematode based on their advisor, whatever,
[01:48:57.300 --> 01:49:03.380]  whoever they were working with. And they couldn't figure out why some zones were, were yielding
[01:49:03.380 --> 01:49:08.900]  significantly more than the other. What we found was that there was very uneven distribution of
[01:49:08.900 --> 01:49:13.540]  those nematodes across the space. So just having larger concentrations of them in different
[01:49:14.900 --> 01:49:23.140]  plant groups, you'll, you'll see a considerable growth rate. But yeah.
[01:49:23.700 --> 01:49:33.540]  It'd be interesting to see, you know, I, I, I'm having like, I'm having really good success
[01:49:33.540 --> 01:49:45.220]  overall. I haven't had a whole lot of issues as far as, you know, I mean, the biggest issue that
[01:49:45.300 --> 01:49:51.860]  I mean, the biggest issue that I have is just the lag time on testing. You know, it's like,
[01:49:51.860 --> 01:49:58.660]  even if I send, send it priority, it still takes time. I would love to have real time data.
[01:50:01.780 --> 01:50:07.620]  Maybe in the future. But it's, it'd be interesting to see. I,
[01:50:07.940 --> 01:50:13.540]  to be completely honest, you know, I, I don't know if it would be,
[01:50:15.140 --> 01:50:20.340]  if it happened, I keep thinking that, you know, when you talk about,
[01:50:22.180 --> 01:50:28.340]  I don't, I don't know when you talk about, what is it? You said there was too many protozoa and
[01:50:28.340 --> 01:50:35.940]  they fed on all the bacteria. Yeah. So, I'm sorry, what was the last part you said?
[01:50:37.940 --> 01:50:46.180]  I, I was, it made me kind of think of, you know, just, I don't know if it has anything to do with
[01:50:47.140 --> 01:50:53.140]  redox potential, oxidation redox potential, if those things being consumed also has an effect
[01:50:53.140 --> 01:50:59.460]  on that as well. I just, I haven't seen any paper. I haven't seen any, any papers. I'd love to read
[01:51:00.020 --> 01:51:07.460]  anything that, you know, correlates to modified systems or just like the functionality of,
[01:51:08.020 --> 01:51:13.380]  you know, what, what the benefit to the plant is. Cause that's my, my main focus is, you know,
[01:51:15.140 --> 01:51:22.980]  is the soil system balance, you know, and then just getting the, the, the, the known benefits
[01:51:22.980 --> 01:51:27.860]  from the bacteria, you know, cause there's tons of science on the stuff that, that I'm using.
[01:51:28.260 --> 01:51:33.620]  And that's kind of like, and I've seen it work really well so that I want to be able to see
[01:51:33.620 --> 01:51:41.700]  if you have some, I'd love to see if they have, if it's making just minerals more available,
[01:51:41.700 --> 01:51:48.420]  if it's increasing the nutrient cycling capacity or how those, how those actually function. I'd
[01:51:48.420 --> 01:51:56.260]  love to be able to see how, how it's functioning in the soil as well. Yeah. What would, what,
[01:51:57.140 --> 01:52:03.220]  what would make it, you know, create, you know, let's say, you know, tighter nodal spacing.
[01:52:03.940 --> 01:52:11.620]  That's really interesting to me because, you know, when we talk about, you know,
[01:52:13.140 --> 01:52:21.300]  a bacteria's ability to have a physiological effect on a plant, it usually comes down to
[01:52:21.380 --> 01:52:26.180]  a couple of things that I've seen, which is the metabolites that that bacteria is producing,
[01:52:27.300 --> 01:52:35.460]  which usually causes something else to happen, like, you know, something is chelated or,
[01:52:35.460 --> 01:52:42.500]  you know, it's an organic compound if used. And then the, also, which is another interesting one,
[01:52:42.500 --> 01:52:51.620]  which is the ability for them to create what are called indoles, which change codons on genes,
[01:52:51.620 --> 01:52:57.460]  which are like the stop and start points, stop and start read points. And so, a lot of these
[01:52:57.460 --> 01:53:05.220]  could just be random gene mutations, but I suspect that because nature's found a way to do this, that
[01:53:05.940 --> 01:53:15.460]  there are also, you know, plenty of indoles that, or bacterial endophytes, fungal endophytes, that
[01:53:15.460 --> 01:53:23.220]  can create indoles to trigger those, you know, different gene responses. So, they either have
[01:53:23.220 --> 01:53:29.940]  more of a, you know, synergistic effect with the plant, or maybe it could even be something that's,
[01:53:29.940 --> 01:53:36.260]  that's, you know, pathogenic. But I think that that's one of the things that I see with the
[01:53:36.260 --> 01:53:46.020]  bacteria. So, my main focus really is I want to see, you know, what the mode of action, I guess,
[01:53:46.020 --> 01:53:50.740]  what the pathway is to see the physiological side effect.
[01:53:51.300 --> 01:53:58.660]  Totally. So, you know, I come from a hydroponics background. I had some really solid hydroponic
[01:53:58.660 --> 01:54:05.780]  mentors that went on to do some pretty big things in cannabis. And not only they were good,
[01:54:05.780 --> 01:54:10.580]  they had very high standards. So, if I came to them and said, hey, I heard this on the internet,
[01:54:10.580 --> 01:54:15.140]  they would literally interrupt with, they would literally interrupt you and say, you know,
[01:54:15.140 --> 01:54:18.980]  have you done this yourself? And be like, well, no, I just read it. And they'd be like, don't say
[01:54:18.980 --> 01:54:23.620]  another word until you go do it yourself. And so, I came up under this environment of, you know,
[01:54:23.620 --> 01:54:28.180]  high standards of the things that you said, and bringing to the table things that you've experienced
[01:54:28.260 --> 01:54:33.780]  while also making a good discussion, but, you know, staying way away from things that weren't
[01:54:33.780 --> 01:54:39.700]  real. And those people were really good at stacking nodes. They were really good at getting the yield.
[01:54:40.500 --> 01:54:44.900]  What they weren't good at was managing powdery mildew, which was my main motivation for getting
[01:54:44.900 --> 01:54:51.300]  into Soil Food Web, because I could see, you know, back what I call like the Prop 215 comfort
[01:54:51.300 --> 01:54:56.180]  area in California, where you could stack 99s and go pretty crazy without fear of getting in trouble.
[01:54:56.180 --> 01:54:59.460]  You know, I was under the impression it was going to be legal in six weeks, you know.
[01:55:00.100 --> 01:55:04.820]  And so, I started looking at how do you get away from using systemic fungicides.
[01:55:06.740 --> 01:55:12.580]  One of the things that I did was I looked back at what those friends were doing as far as like
[01:55:12.580 --> 01:55:18.180]  foliar feeding strategies they would use during the, excuse me, during the first weeks in veg to
[01:55:18.180 --> 01:55:25.940]  stack nodes. And so, I kept trying to look for ways in biology to do that same thing. What I found is
[01:55:25.940 --> 01:55:32.100]  what creates that the most is these predator to prey interactions. And so, essentially what you
[01:55:32.100 --> 01:55:39.860]  have is in bacteria, you have the potential for nutrients, but it's mostly working on
[01:55:39.860 --> 01:55:48.100]  digesting minerals and sticking small pieces of soil particles together. When you take a nematode
[01:55:48.100 --> 01:55:53.940]  or you take a protozoa and you introduce it in there, you now have a faster release of nutrients.
[01:55:54.900 --> 01:56:03.300]  How that works is in a simple concept, you have like the carbon to nitrogen ratio of
[01:56:04.900 --> 01:56:09.540]  the different organisms and the carbon to nitrogen ratio of the various organisms are different.
[01:56:10.340 --> 01:56:18.340]  And so, as the protozoa consumes a bacteria, it takes in some of those carbon and nitrogens,
[01:56:18.340 --> 01:56:23.060]  but it needs to match its carbon to nitrogen ratio. So, there's going to be an extra of carbon,
[01:56:23.140 --> 01:56:28.020]  there's going to be an extra of nitrogen. Just like when we were dividing in elementary school
[01:56:28.020 --> 01:56:33.220]  and getting remainders, it's kind of the same concept. It does mention it in the paper,
[01:56:33.220 --> 01:56:41.780]  I didn't highlight it, but it talks about how these things happen. So, if one organism is a 10
[01:56:41.780 --> 01:56:49.780]  to 2 and another organism is a 5 to 2, well, then that 10 to 2 animal is going to eat that 5 to 2,
[01:56:49.780 --> 01:56:54.420]  and then it's going to eat a second one to get its 10, and then it's going to have two extras
[01:56:54.420 --> 01:57:00.100]  because it only needs two of the nitrogen portions. So, if it's 10 carbons and two nitrogens,
[01:57:00.100 --> 01:57:05.540]  and it's eating something that's five carbons and two nitrogens, it gets its two nitrogens from one
[01:57:05.540 --> 01:57:11.620]  bacteria, but when it eats the second one, it now matched the carbon, but it releases two nitrogens,
[01:57:12.580 --> 01:57:16.340]  I guess. And so, yeah.
[01:57:16.340 --> 01:57:18.980]  And it makes sense too.
[01:57:19.700 --> 01:57:26.820]  Exactly. So, one of the paragraphs that I was reading in the presentation in the beginning was
[01:57:27.460 --> 01:57:33.940]  how much more nitrogen was being released in a given organism assemblage or assembly of
[01:57:34.740 --> 01:57:43.220]  organisms. And by far, well, I mean, my own personal journey was starting out with
[01:57:43.220 --> 01:57:48.420]  non-biologically complete materials, meaning a compost that had mostly bacteria,
[01:57:49.140 --> 01:57:55.300]  you know, maybe zero fungi, definitely no nematodes, but it had mostly bacteria.
[01:57:55.300 --> 01:57:59.700]  If I did the protozoan infusion and added it to that in an appropriate ratio,
[01:57:59.700 --> 01:58:06.260]  and you could maintain bacteria and protozoa at ideal ratios, you accelerated growth significantly.
[01:58:06.260 --> 01:58:10.900]  And this is where you start to really compete with, match, and even sometimes exceed the
[01:58:10.900 --> 01:58:15.300]  growth rates of hydroponics is getting these predator-prey interactions in line.
[01:58:16.740 --> 01:58:22.020]  Back in my early days of doing this before we had compost that had the full spectrum of soil
[01:58:22.020 --> 01:58:27.540]  food web organisms in desirable populations and ratios like we want, I had to do these all,
[01:58:27.540 --> 01:58:36.100]  these type of strategies. The obstacle is its scale. For a lot of years, it was remarkably
[01:58:36.100 --> 01:58:40.820]  impractical for me to try and teach somebody how to do a protozoan infusion. And in a lot of ways,
[01:58:40.820 --> 01:58:46.100]  it was actually very risky because if you overbrew it, you get disease. If you overbrew it, you get
[01:58:46.100 --> 01:58:52.020]  too many protozoa. And then if you water it in at too high of a rate, you'll overconsume the bacteria
[01:58:52.020 --> 01:58:57.060]  and you'll collapse the entire system like a house of cards. And so you'll get a tremendous
[01:58:57.060 --> 01:59:03.940]  growth rate and above ground visible plant growth response, but then growth will stall and fall off
[01:59:04.980 --> 01:59:15.140]  in flower. And so as a strategy... If you have a healthy soil, like I do when I'm testing,
[01:59:15.140 --> 01:59:22.740]  might have the proper mineral levels. I don't find... So are you saying that this is just for
[01:59:22.740 --> 01:59:27.540]  like a system that's just straight biologically driven? You're not adding any minerals into it
[01:59:27.540 --> 01:59:32.820]  or anything like that. It's just simply, you're just trying to convert what's already there.
[01:59:35.060 --> 01:59:42.100]  Yeah, it's any style in any system. And so in your particular system where you're introducing a lot
[01:59:42.100 --> 01:59:49.620]  of bacteria and you have adequate, desirable, and consistent dosage of mineral density. So you've
[01:59:49.620 --> 01:59:54.900]  achieved your commercial quality and yields through being very accurate with chemistry,
[01:59:54.900 --> 02:00:01.140]  with the basic support of biology. If you were to add in the HB nematodes or you were to add in an
[02:00:01.140 --> 02:00:06.980]  appropriate dilution of the protozoan infusion, it's likely you'd get another 10 to 30%
[02:00:07.940 --> 02:00:16.580]  in most categories. The tough part is, until really recently, we didn't have a way of
[02:00:17.140 --> 02:00:23.140]  scaling the protozoan infusion technique, which in your system where you're doing more of a dry
[02:00:23.140 --> 02:00:29.220]  back, you're regularly inoculating, you would need to regularly inoculate with these things
[02:00:29.220 --> 02:00:33.140]  because you might get some die off in the... I don't let anything dry out.
[02:00:34.020 --> 02:00:41.540]  Yeah. Well, I mean, I don't mean dry out. I just mean in that process of dry back, you move in and
[02:00:41.540 --> 02:00:48.740]  out of desirable moisture for the organisms to be operating at the highest levels possible,
[02:00:49.700 --> 02:00:53.620]  which there are, it starts to split and become more and more and more and more and more. But
[02:00:54.020 --> 02:00:59.700]  even just putting in some HB nematodes, the tough part would be if you added the nematodes to your
[02:00:59.700 --> 02:01:04.260]  res, like you do with the EM1, they would all sink to the bottom. And then if you're dispensing it
[02:01:04.260 --> 02:01:09.780]  with a pond pump, you'd pull them out. You can, but what we found was more practical was just put
[02:01:09.780 --> 02:01:16.340]  the nematodes in a smaller solution. And so the nematodes that we like to get come on a sponge.
[02:01:17.220 --> 02:01:22.180]  And so you just... Sorry?
[02:01:22.740 --> 02:01:23.700]  From BioBest.
[02:01:25.380 --> 02:01:32.020]  They're the first people that I saw offer the sponges. Yeah. And it's by far the best strategy,
[02:01:32.020 --> 02:01:37.620]  all the powder and all that. The vermiculite's the worst. The powder is dodgy because if it dries out,
[02:01:37.620 --> 02:01:43.940]  they all die. But the sponge is... The gel sponge, I think, is my preferred method for inoculating
[02:01:43.940 --> 02:01:50.100]  with the different nematode varieties. And it's really easy and they're storable. So
[02:01:51.700 --> 02:02:07.780]  they control a lot of soil insects. HB is a good one also for root aphid, if I'm not mistaken.
[02:02:08.340 --> 02:02:15.220]  The combination of Steiner NEMA and HB works really, really well for general inoculation for
[02:02:15.220 --> 02:02:22.500]  IPM, especially at scale because... Well, I didn't have a problem, but I was using a really large
[02:02:22.500 --> 02:02:29.620]  pump, a large volume pump, and it's a submersible and it just has... It's really just a submersible
[02:02:29.620 --> 02:02:36.900]  and then it has this PVC that just goes back into the water. So it's constantly moving large volumes
[02:02:36.980 --> 02:02:43.620]  in a small space to continue agitate. And when I scoped it on our microscope,
[02:02:45.940 --> 02:02:53.780]  even after the runoff through the soil, I did a test one time. I watered it in. I looked at it
[02:02:53.780 --> 02:02:58.820]  after it was running in the mix for a little while and then I watered it into the soil and
[02:02:58.820 --> 02:03:06.100]  then I took some of the solution just to see what was in there. Nice. Yeah, it's a... They're really
[02:03:06.100 --> 02:03:11.700]  good. I mean, I've been using nematodes for a long time. I just never thought of them as...
[02:03:12.900 --> 02:03:18.740]  I just never thought of them in that context as far as a bacterial cycler.
[02:03:20.260 --> 02:03:23.780]  Yeah. And what's funny is if you... I've been saying this for several years on different
[02:03:23.780 --> 02:03:29.700]  podcasts and things like that. And when growers call the predator insect people and they say,
[02:03:29.700 --> 02:03:33.700]  I want the nematode that produces nutrient cycling, and they'll always say it doesn't do it,
[02:03:33.700 --> 02:03:38.100]  which is kind of funny to me because even if they're not eating bacteria and cycling nutrients,
[02:03:38.660 --> 02:03:41.380]  anything that eats another thing is cycling nutrients.
[02:03:43.380 --> 02:03:48.020]  But even the predator insect people aren't really hip to what I'm talking about. But
[02:03:49.060 --> 02:03:53.220]  there's some questions in the chat. I'll restate it again. But the nematodes I prefer for the
[02:03:53.220 --> 02:03:58.900]  purpose of nutrient cycling, I'm not considering any pest control. I'm literally looking to
[02:03:58.900 --> 02:04:06.020]  increase the delivery of nutrients is HB, so heterabditis. The most common nematodes are SF
[02:04:06.020 --> 02:04:10.500]  or SC, the Steiner-Nema-Feltier or Steiner-Nema-Karposkier or how you say all this stuff.
[02:04:11.220 --> 02:04:17.780]  But the HB... And I prefer to use Sound Horticulture. We've used all the brands
[02:04:18.740 --> 02:04:26.100]  that are available and Sound Horticulture continues to have accurate concentrations and
[02:04:26.180 --> 02:04:30.180]  they're very alive. So we've been using them for the last few years. But really,
[02:04:30.180 --> 02:04:35.220]  if you're looking to distribute them evenly, a lot of times when we start to put things into a
[02:04:35.220 --> 02:04:41.940]  res biologically, we start to run into wild dispersant issues. And so the bacteria will mix
[02:04:41.940 --> 02:04:46.900]  quite well. Anything else really starts to get kind of wonky, especially the nematodes. But
[02:04:47.460 --> 02:04:56.740]  we've found the best results at any scale really is dislodging the nematodes into a very small
[02:04:56.740 --> 02:05:01.300]  volume of water. And so a lot of times we'll dissolve it. I have like a little Pyrex dish
[02:05:01.300 --> 02:05:07.140]  that's about three inches deep and about that big. And we'll put the sponge in there with just three
[02:05:07.140 --> 02:05:14.260]  or four ounces of water. And then from there, we'll take that kind of weird milky solution
[02:05:14.260 --> 02:05:19.540]  and I'll separate it when it's at its smallest volume. Because the more you start to move those
[02:05:19.540 --> 02:05:24.020]  nematodes into a larger volume of water, they're so small and their density is heavy, they're in
[02:05:24.020 --> 02:05:27.940]  water. So they go to the bottom, they get really dispersed. So I always try to keep them in the
[02:05:27.940 --> 02:05:33.300]  smallest volume of water. And then I put them into a little scientific wash bottle, like a little
[02:05:33.300 --> 02:05:38.260]  eight ounce. Sometimes you go on Amazon, they sell them as a tattoo wash bottle or an eight
[02:05:38.260 --> 02:05:44.020]  ounce scientific wash bottle. For most scales, the eight ounce bottle is good. When we get into
[02:05:44.020 --> 02:05:50.260]  larger properties, we move up to like a 16 or 24 ounce bottle. But anytime you increase the water
[02:05:50.260 --> 02:05:56.100]  volume with nematodes, you're penalized with variations and dispersion. So that's my preferred
[02:05:56.100 --> 02:06:05.300]  method. You just go around and do a little bit of that. So yeah. I honestly have to get going here.
[02:06:06.100 --> 02:06:12.980]  But it was, as always, really great to be on the show. It was good talking to you, Scott. Thanks,
[02:06:13.620 --> 02:06:20.820]  Peter, for bringing this wonderful platform to the community. If anybody's interested in
[02:06:21.620 --> 02:06:29.540]  what I'm doing, you can find me at Rust Brandon, all one word, R-U-S-T-B-R-A-N-D-O-N on Instagram.
[02:06:29.540 --> 02:06:31.700]  Oh my God. It's almost like we had it queued up.
[02:06:35.540 --> 02:06:39.060]  So yeah, I appreciate you letting me come on here.
[02:06:39.860 --> 02:06:49.460]  And by the way, can we get a vote in the chat? Would you like to see the Scott and Brandon show?
[02:06:51.460 --> 02:07:03.300]  Weekly? You guys are the two curmudgeons. The two soil curmudgeons. But anyway, that's what I was
[02:07:03.300 --> 02:07:07.860]  thinking about as you guys were talking, that if we had a weekly conversation.
[02:07:10.580 --> 02:07:17.220]  It might be interesting. I'm getting all of my podcasting stuff in my office here set up. So
[02:07:17.940 --> 02:07:23.060]  hopefully I can bring a little bit more professional quality content, I guess,
[02:07:23.060 --> 02:07:30.900]  to the YouTube channel and IG and all that stuff. But it is getting late. I have another appointment.
[02:07:31.380 --> 02:07:34.740]  So thanks again, guys. I'll talk to you guys soon.
[02:07:34.740 --> 02:07:38.500]  All right. See you, Brandon. All right. So Scott, you got a whole bunch of
[02:07:38.500 --> 02:07:44.020]  questions from the chat. So let's... Jonathan Moore, I've seen your same question
[02:07:44.020 --> 02:07:47.140]  five times and I've been patiently waiting to ask it.
[02:07:49.940 --> 02:07:53.860]  Can we address the use of trichoderm and container soil-less substrates, Dr. Engel?
[02:07:54.420 --> 02:08:02.420]  So when Dr. Lane is talking about the difference between trichoderm and mycorrhizae,
[02:08:04.020 --> 02:08:10.420]  it's coming from four decades of analyzing soil organisms in all types of systems.
[02:08:11.620 --> 02:08:18.420]  From what I understand, if you put organisms in a hierarchy of benefit they provide to plants,
[02:08:18.980 --> 02:08:24.580]  the mycorrhizae would be slightly above the trichoderma as far as functions that they can
[02:08:24.580 --> 02:08:31.140]  perform. The trichoderma are most well known for dealing with powdery mildew issues.
[02:08:32.180 --> 02:08:38.500]  If you have an issue... And so the reason why Dr. Lane says trichoderma in select issues is because
[02:08:39.380 --> 02:08:44.900]  if you're doing any reasonable application of what Dr. Lane is saying, you have no mold issues.
[02:08:44.900 --> 02:08:48.740]  And most people find that offensive when I say that and they think I'm lying, but that's
[02:08:49.540 --> 02:08:56.180]  the literal truth. We... I'm trying to think in the hundreds of farms we've worked with,
[02:08:58.580 --> 02:09:03.060]  most farms get rid of powdery mildew in the first harvest cycle that we work with them and they
[02:09:03.060 --> 02:09:11.460]  actually work to improve the ratios and quantity of various organisms in the soil. And very few
[02:09:11.460 --> 02:09:15.380]  farms have had any powdery mildew linger on into the second harvest that we worked with them.
[02:09:16.020 --> 02:09:22.500]  So that's why Dr. Lane says in certain situations trichoderma, what she's saying is in the event
[02:09:22.500 --> 02:09:28.980]  of powdery mildew breaks out, use the trichoderma and then re-inoculate with quality compost to
[02:09:28.980 --> 02:09:32.260]  correct the undesirable ratios in the soil that are leading to powdery mildew.
[02:09:34.100 --> 02:09:40.100]  Okay. And here's a question from the... Actually, well, just hold on. Read that
[02:09:40.100 --> 02:09:46.660]  because you're talking trichoderma. So that sounds interesting, but I don't know. I can't
[02:09:46.660 --> 02:09:55.300]  confirm or deny anything really DNA related. For the really specifics of the science,
[02:09:56.740 --> 02:10:03.380]  my wife is a little bit better. Nick Tomasini is really good at the real specifics of DNA science
[02:10:03.380 --> 02:10:08.740]  and stuff like that. He's doing some research on some DNA. I'm more of the practical in the ground
[02:10:08.740 --> 02:10:13.700]  boots execution in the commercial space. I obviously have an understanding of the scientific
[02:10:13.700 --> 02:10:17.620]  base, but as far as things of DNA, I'm honestly not sure about that.
[02:10:17.620 --> 02:10:22.740]  All right. That's a fair answer. All right. So this is from the Discord.
[02:10:25.220 --> 02:10:29.380]  So that's another one. Again, I'm honestly not sure about that. I got that question in the
[02:10:29.380 --> 02:10:37.060]  email earlier in the week. I haven't got a chance to answer it, but that's... I don't know. I'm in
[02:10:37.540 --> 02:10:43.060]  what made flowers grow potent. What ratio?
[02:10:45.700 --> 02:10:53.060]  So, all right. So for like the past hour and a half, I've been copy pasting questions.
[02:10:53.060 --> 02:10:58.980]  I would like to talk... There's been a lot of tea brewing on there. I know you got some tea out there.
[02:10:58.980 --> 02:11:00.180]  Did you say tea brewing?
[02:11:00.900 --> 02:11:07.220]  There's a lot of comments in the tea brewing that I think need to be clarified.
[02:11:07.220 --> 02:11:12.580]  Yeah. So MightyMicrobes asked, Scott, you should touch on people brewing teas without a microscope.
[02:11:12.580 --> 02:11:15.620]  Very dangerous. If you ain't scoping, you're just hoping.
[02:11:16.260 --> 02:11:20.340]  Yeah. And when you say that, people that don't have a microscope, they immediately shut their
[02:11:20.340 --> 02:11:26.420]  ears and turn off and say you're being disrespectful. But what the cannabis community or
[02:11:26.420 --> 02:11:35.860]  really organic gardening in general doesn't understand is that literally nobody is brewing
[02:11:35.860 --> 02:11:43.060]  tea to the specifications that Dr. Elaine has outlined in her research work to be productive
[02:11:43.060 --> 02:11:48.980]  against pathogens. We've worked with every type of tea brewer available on the market.
[02:11:48.980 --> 02:11:55.380]  Some of those machines, you can make tea that hits Dr. Elaine's parameters one time,
[02:11:56.260 --> 02:12:01.940]  but disease persists in the two beans and on the whatever shenanigans they got in the tank
[02:12:03.220 --> 02:12:08.100]  that persist and are very, very much quantifiable in brew two, three, four, five, six.
[02:12:08.980 --> 02:12:13.140]  In my journey as a soil food web analyst, we've talked directly to these
[02:12:13.860 --> 02:12:18.420]  tea brewing manufacturers. We've told them what we found in not one situation.
[02:12:19.620 --> 02:12:23.940]  Have they been open to our insight as to what we're seeing with their machines in the field?
[02:12:23.940 --> 02:12:28.340]  For a lot of years, I never mentioned this for fear of getting sued. But I mean, we're going on
[02:12:28.340 --> 02:12:34.260]  six years of seeing the same shit. And the community really just needs to evolve in their
[02:12:34.900 --> 02:12:38.020]  requirement of accountability from people that make tea brewing equipment.
[02:12:38.900 --> 02:12:44.580]  And we need to up our education on what we're even doing. So as far as like my personal strategy,
[02:12:44.580 --> 02:12:50.820]  we have abandoned all commercial products that would be a tea brewer. None of them are appropriate
[02:12:50.820 --> 02:12:56.260]  in my perspective, in my analysis. We use a piece of equipment from the beer brewing industry,
[02:12:56.260 --> 02:13:01.380]  because beer brewing has the same requirements that we do. They need consistent, repeatable
[02:13:02.180 --> 02:13:08.020]  results that are not contaminated by undesirable things. So their equipment works very well for us.
[02:13:08.020 --> 02:13:13.780]  So we use something called a non-jacketed conical fermenter. And it's all stainless steel. There's
[02:13:13.780 --> 02:13:19.780]  absolutely nothing inside the tank. We use one that's cone bottom. So we aerate from the bottom,
[02:13:19.780 --> 02:13:26.180]  which is very important. And then it uses a clover clamp, tri-clamp fitting so that everything can be
[02:13:26.180 --> 02:13:32.100]  removed and sanitized. In my personal opinion, that's about the only type of equipment that you
[02:13:32.100 --> 02:13:37.380]  should consider using if you're in the regulated space. So that's the first kind of soapbox part
[02:13:37.380 --> 02:13:43.780]  there too. But there's a lot of comments in the comment section talking about trying tea and not
[02:13:43.780 --> 02:13:48.740]  having any results. And one said they tried tea and had worse results. Well, that's exactly
[02:13:48.740 --> 02:13:55.380]  confirming what I'm saying. Like most people are brewing extremely anaerobic teas that are
[02:13:56.020 --> 02:14:03.060]  very detrimental on a plant health. Where people see benefit is if you put organisms into a tank
[02:14:03.060 --> 02:14:12.260]  and you put a food source, that behaves as a digester, so to speak. And you can take organic
[02:14:12.260 --> 02:14:18.180]  inputs and make them more bioavailable. So the benefit most people get from tea brewing process
[02:14:18.900 --> 02:14:26.580]  is because they use organisms to break down and make those nutrients more plant available. So you
[02:14:26.580 --> 02:14:31.940]  get a plant growth response. But in that tea brewing process, I guarantee you, you brewed
[02:14:31.940 --> 02:14:39.460]  some levels of disease that start to surface. And when you compare recipes that I've personally
[02:14:39.460 --> 02:14:45.060]  found successful and other recipes for tea brewing on the internet that most people follow,
[02:14:45.860 --> 02:14:53.060]  the amount of food inputs that they put in are literally 100 times what I put in to get
[02:14:53.620 --> 02:14:59.860]  results that fit with the research that's defined by Dr. Lane-Ingham to have a positive effect on
[02:14:59.860 --> 02:15:05.780]  plant pathogens. That research does exist. It's just kind of hard to access. I think the Compost
[02:15:05.780 --> 02:15:13.540]  Tea Brewing Manual 1 has it. Dr. Lane made a second tea brewing manual in like 2015 or something.
[02:15:14.340 --> 02:15:18.820]  Sarah and I were given a paper copy, but that book was never put into print.
[02:15:20.100 --> 02:15:25.300]  And I believe if you dig deep enough, there are some research papers of hers that show
[02:15:28.660 --> 02:15:35.460]  what populations of organisms in a finished tea and what leaf surface coverage is needed to
[02:15:35.460 --> 02:15:42.180]  block pathogens. Every single time we follow those characteristics and those biological
[02:15:42.180 --> 02:15:49.540]  population targets without exceeding in an undesirable way, it always, always has a very
[02:15:49.540 --> 02:15:57.700]  profound effect on any sort of leaf pathogen. What we found in our commercial work is scaling tea
[02:15:57.700 --> 02:16:01.780]  brewing is almost impossible. And so we've had to come up with other strategies. And that's why
[02:16:01.780 --> 02:16:08.580]  you're now seeing the switch from tea to extract. Tea is incredibly inappropriate in the commercial
[02:16:08.580 --> 02:16:14.980]  regulated cannabis space. Yeah, there you go. Compost Tea Brewing Manual. I believe inside
[02:16:14.980 --> 02:16:21.140]  there, in there, she gives the targets for bacterial populations, fungal populations.
[02:16:21.700 --> 02:16:27.940]  And it's, believe it, it's not very much. It's remarkably low of what is needed. But what's
[02:16:27.940 --> 02:16:34.340]  really needed is not having an abundance of the omicetes, which are the water molds. They're
[02:16:34.340 --> 02:16:39.940]  absolutely very directly correlated to powdery mildew issues in my personal experience. And so
[02:16:39.940 --> 02:16:46.740]  you have, you have a community at wide that is putting literally 100 times the food resources
[02:16:46.740 --> 02:16:51.780]  to end up with a healthy compost tea. They're brewing it too long. They're using a machine
[02:16:51.780 --> 02:16:57.860]  that brings disease from harvest to harvest to harvest. And this is why it makes it easy for
[02:16:57.860 --> 02:17:04.020]  people to discount the techniques because you're not doing what Dr. Lane is saying. When you do it,
[02:17:04.020 --> 02:17:09.540]  she says, in regards to tea brewing and targets, I have not seen something that's more effective.
[02:17:10.980 --> 02:17:13.460]  And just quickly, this is the, uh,
[02:17:15.460 --> 02:17:19.300]  well, that's not what I was looking at. Hold on.
[02:17:21.780 --> 02:17:28.900]  Give me, there we go. Wait. All right. Hold on. Back to, no. So weird.
[02:17:29.380 --> 02:17:35.300]  Um, anyway, it was the stout tank. It was the conical.
[02:17:36.820 --> 02:17:39.620]  Yeah. You got a video on the last video. Yeah.
[02:17:40.180 --> 02:17:48.420]  Yeah. But, uh, and then someone asked, um, about foliar sprays of microbes. Are you.
[02:17:49.060 --> 02:17:55.380]  Yeah. Um, you know, for the context of our commercial work, which requires scale and giving
[02:17:55.380 --> 02:18:01.780]  instructions to people while we're not there, um, it gets very difficult. So the position that that's
[02:18:01.780 --> 02:18:08.500]  put me into is, um, we have a powder bacterial inoculant that contains the standard 10 to 12
[02:18:08.500 --> 02:18:14.340]  species that are in every product. And it has 10 to 12 species that aren't in any other product.
[02:18:14.340 --> 02:18:20.340]  So that's the easy, like dissolving water spray on by any employee that works really well.
[02:18:21.220 --> 02:18:27.220]  Um, what we find in our, in our, in our, in our analysis of properties is you don't even really
[02:18:27.220 --> 02:18:32.660]  need to spray the above ground biomass with organisms. You just need to have a very healthy
[02:18:32.660 --> 02:18:39.780]  root zone from the standpoint of, um, desirable and undesirable organisms. So what we find is
[02:18:40.100 --> 02:18:45.940]  that we don't even have to cover the leaf surfaces to have them protected. We need to have a root
[02:18:45.940 --> 02:18:51.860]  zone that is extremely low on my seats when compared to the beneficial fungi or what we
[02:18:51.860 --> 02:18:57.380]  would put into the beneficial fungi classification. Um, and when you do that, it works very well.
[02:18:59.140 --> 02:19:06.020]  So we do, you know, we do have other situations where, um, we do, we do have an ability to put
[02:19:06.900 --> 02:19:12.500]  We do, we do have an ability to put compost tea into a shelf stable bag. Um, and we have a couple
[02:19:12.500 --> 02:19:17.460]  of clients that use that on intake of clones that that's extremely well at separating your facility
[02:19:17.460 --> 02:19:23.140]  from powdery mildew. That works very well. Um, but it's cost effect. It's, it's, it's costly.
[02:19:23.140 --> 02:19:28.820]  We're shipping gallons of tea around, you know, so there's some, there's some regenerative
[02:19:28.900 --> 02:19:32.900]  obstacles there, a lot of plastic, but it works really well.
[02:19:34.180 --> 02:19:44.020]  So this is a personal question. If, I mean, for me, uh, if in your yard, you had hypothetically
[02:19:44.020 --> 02:19:52.020]  a four by eight raised bed and you were to build it up and, and like, what, what's your soil mix?
[02:19:52.020 --> 02:19:58.180]  Like what, what would you, when Scott scams puts on his, uh, home gardener pants
[02:20:00.180 --> 02:20:04.740]  and takes off his large scale facility consultant pants.
[02:20:05.540 --> 02:20:10.260]  You know, it's crazy. It's always the same answer. That's the beauty. Simplicity works at all scales.
[02:20:11.220 --> 02:20:18.260]  Um, as far as soil mixes, well, the first thing is not being remarkably dysfunctional from a
[02:20:18.260 --> 02:20:23.780]  chemistry standpoint, which is most of the soils that people use. Um, a lot of people ask me what's
[02:20:23.780 --> 02:20:30.340]  my soil mix and they have to understand that, you know, to be, to be good at making soil,
[02:20:31.140 --> 02:20:34.820]  you need to take the chemistry of your components into consideration.
[02:20:35.380 --> 02:20:42.420]  Um, people always want a like per cubic foot, um, per cubic foot amount of amendments,
[02:20:42.420 --> 02:20:48.180]  which makes it easy for us to follow. What people I think are completely missing is that there's a
[02:20:48.660 --> 02:20:56.100]  NPK value of the compost. There's an NPK value of the cocoa or peat moss. Um, the lava rock
[02:20:56.100 --> 02:21:01.220]  contributes to some extent or whatever you're using. And then it's all the things that you put
[02:21:01.220 --> 02:21:08.420]  into it. And so when I'm regardless of the scale, I always follow the same process. I gather my
[02:21:08.420 --> 02:21:14.980]  inputs. I make a mock mix up in the ratios as close to what I'm expecting in my finished mix.
[02:21:15.620 --> 02:21:20.340]  I send that off without putting any amendments to the lab to get a chemistry analysis, to see what
[02:21:20.340 --> 02:21:26.260]  it is. Um, in the case of a large commercial facility, we actually do the compost first
[02:21:26.260 --> 02:21:31.220]  before we even bother with any of the other stuff. We'll send the compost in for a basic
[02:21:31.220 --> 02:21:37.460]  Malik three test to see what the, the amount of potassium is in that product, because a lot of
[02:21:37.460 --> 02:21:43.700]  composts that are available to really everyone are so high in potassium because they've been
[02:21:43.700 --> 02:21:49.620]  rushed through the process or their raw inputs were out of whack. That even if you blend that
[02:21:49.620 --> 02:21:54.820]  into a one third, one third, one third soil mix, you'll never get to the target. You can't add
[02:21:54.820 --> 02:22:00.900]  enough calcium and magnesium to overcome the quantity of potassium. So when I'm making a soil
[02:22:00.900 --> 02:22:07.380]  mix, the first strategy is identify which compost you have available to you will even allow you to
[02:22:07.380 --> 02:22:13.540]  get to the goal. Once we've determined that, then we make a mock mix. My personal favorite,
[02:22:13.540 --> 02:22:19.780]  or what my least favorite is a peat moss, um, one third, one third, one third. I, I'm not convinced
[02:22:19.780 --> 02:22:25.380]  cannabis really likes that even though we use it. Um, it's very hydrophobic. Um, I think there's a
[02:22:25.380 --> 02:22:30.340]  lot of problems with it. It holds too much water too long, which actually slows down plant growth.
[02:22:30.900 --> 02:22:35.300]  So I've gone a wide range of going from the peat moss, one third, one third,
[02:22:35.940 --> 02:22:40.900]  one third to the other end of the spectrum where we did cocoa. Uh, the growth rates in the cocoa
[02:22:40.900 --> 02:22:46.340]  went up considerably from the full peat moss, but then we found that they were very unforgiving
[02:22:46.340 --> 02:22:52.100]  like in a traditional cocoa strategy. So if you're growing in pure cocoa and perlite or something in
[02:22:52.100 --> 02:22:57.060]  a pot and you let that pot dry out too much, it'll torch the roots and you'll get that,
[02:22:57.780 --> 02:23:02.820]  you know, really unhappy plant look in a living soil. You still kind of have that same effects
[02:23:02.820 --> 02:23:09.140]  with the full cocoa mix. So we experiment in our, you know, loosely termed third, third,
[02:23:09.140 --> 02:23:15.700]  third mix in that one third, it's a blend of cocoa and peat. Um, depending on where that
[02:23:15.700 --> 02:23:20.740]  soil is going depends on the ratio. As the water retention part.
[02:23:24.020 --> 02:23:28.580]  Well, yeah. So the, I guess the third, the third, third, third mentality that most of us have is
[02:23:28.580 --> 02:23:34.980]  one third aeration, one third compost, and then one third, usually peat moss. Um, I have personal
[02:23:34.980 --> 02:23:39.780]  objections to the harvesting of peat moss. So I've been looking for ways to minimize, you know,
[02:23:39.780 --> 02:23:43.940]  can't be perfect, but we need to minimize where we can. I'm not saying shipping carbon around the
[02:23:43.940 --> 02:23:49.620]  world is a perfect solution, but I feel like it's definitely less than. Well, so Delano who, uh,
[02:23:50.420 --> 02:23:58.900]  Kevin and I, uh, did a fundraiser for to kind of jumpstart his soil company. He he's big on palm
[02:23:58.900 --> 02:24:08.100]  fronds and, uh, B I mean, I can look outside in LA and see, you know, they're all over the streets,
[02:24:08.100 --> 02:24:16.020]  right. It's, uh, it's, um, I know, uh, pit moss sent me a whole bunch of pit moss, which is
[02:24:16.020 --> 02:24:22.900]  basically like recycled newspapers. So I've been, I dumped a ton of that into a, uh, grassroots
[02:24:22.900 --> 02:24:30.260]  raised bed. But like, my question is like, for me as a home grower, I have a, I have a two chamber,
[02:24:31.300 --> 02:24:39.460]  each chambers, 55 gallon bin, uh, home compost or all my food scraps go in there. I have a worm bin,
[02:24:39.460 --> 02:24:47.300]  just the, um, I, I forget what the, the company is, but it's like, uh, yeah,
[02:24:49.300 --> 02:24:54.340]  yeah. You know, just the home, the home worm bin. So like I have both those and I'm kind of like,
[02:24:56.740 --> 02:25:02.940]  what else do I need from outside my half acre yard? Um,
[02:25:03.180 --> 02:25:11.100]  um, like I feel like, I feel like I've replaced the peat moss or the cocoa, uh, you know, with,
[02:25:13.740 --> 02:25:17.340]  you know, the pit moss, which we'll see how that goes. But, um,
[02:25:20.700 --> 02:25:25.980]  it's kind of like, if, again, I'm trying to get you to take your profession, your pro head off,
[02:25:25.980 --> 02:25:31.980]  like Larry bird, Larry bird, you're teaching kids. No, no, it's the same answer. Kids,
[02:25:31.980 --> 02:25:36.620]  kids need to step the damn games up because I don't, I don't care if you're running a single
[02:25:36.620 --> 02:25:42.940]  light building. Um, you know, if you're running a two by four tent, how much electricity is that
[02:25:42.940 --> 02:25:48.700]  going to take over the course of a, you know, 12 week harvest cycle, it's going to be more than
[02:25:48.700 --> 02:25:53.900]  the cost of a $25 soil test to start out with a good soil to have a good result. And a lot of
[02:25:53.900 --> 02:26:00.140]  times the smaller, the grower, the less, the less room for error you have. And so what happens is
[02:26:00.140 --> 02:26:06.380]  people start blending soil mixes together based on Instagram feeds or internet recipes. And they
[02:26:06.380 --> 02:26:11.580]  end up with extremely dysfunctional chemistry in that finished soil, simply because of the raw
[02:26:11.580 --> 02:26:17.100]  materials they were able to aggregate. And so what I'm saying is regardless of how much soil you're
[02:26:17.100 --> 02:26:22.540]  going to make, regardless of your inputs, before you add the mineral amendments to whatever that
[02:26:22.540 --> 02:26:29.420]  mixture of products is, you should send it off for an 18 or $25 soil test. Um, there's a question
[02:26:29.420 --> 02:26:35.260]  right now, it just popped up. The $25 test comes from Logan. Um, there's another, another, uh,
[02:26:36.220 --> 02:26:40.060]  company called spectrum analytical that I've recently learned about their test is $18.
[02:26:41.260 --> 02:26:48.940]  So you mail it to Ohio. And so for that, I would basically be mailing my, uh, the,
[02:26:48.940 --> 02:26:54.940]  the stuff I'm pulling out of my thermophilic compost bin to be like, let's make sure this
[02:26:54.940 --> 02:26:58.540]  is something I want to be putting in my raised bed to grow the stuff I'm going to eat.
[02:26:59.260 --> 02:27:04.860]  Well, and not only that, it's at what ratio. So say if the potassium in that soil, or excuse me,
[02:27:04.860 --> 02:27:10.620]  the potassium in that compost is high, then you're not going to be able to use a full 33%.
[02:27:10.620 --> 02:27:16.700]  You might have to use 22% because the end result of that chemistry is going to be so high. And so
[02:27:16.700 --> 02:27:21.100]  this is what people don't understand. Like we, you know, we've done a lot of analysis for micro
[02:27:21.100 --> 02:27:26.460]  growers and literally some of the largest ones around. And one of the farms in particular,
[02:27:26.460 --> 02:27:31.660]  we worked with followed a standard recipe, um, that they had even done at another facility.
[02:27:31.660 --> 02:27:37.500]  And they moved up into a facility that was three times or, uh, uh, four times the size.
[02:27:38.220 --> 02:27:42.700]  And they followed the same exact thing that worked at their previous facility just fine. But the
[02:27:42.700 --> 02:27:48.060]  compost source was now different. They ended up with soil chemistry that was so dysfunctional.
[02:27:48.060 --> 02:27:52.460]  You know, it was going to take like two to three years of amending to bring it back into balance.
[02:27:52.460 --> 02:27:57.820]  And so what we had to do was we had to recut that soil to dilute all the nutrients down.
[02:27:57.820 --> 02:28:02.940]  We send it in for analysis again, and then we amend to correct what the dilution made.
[02:28:04.460 --> 02:28:09.260]  So that's, that's, you know what I mean? Like, I know you want like the simple answers, but I think
[02:28:09.260 --> 02:28:16.220]  the industry needs to move up a half a hair. Um, because so many people are struggling so hard with
[02:28:16.220 --> 02:28:20.940]  living soil because they're just doing what's accessible to them, which is putting things
[02:28:20.940 --> 02:28:26.860]  together for soil mixes that have worked for other people. But their raw materials came with a
[02:28:26.860 --> 02:28:32.780]  remarkably different chemistry. And that can literally lead to years of headaches, especially
[02:28:32.780 --> 02:28:37.180]  if you're not testing. If you're not testing, you're never gonna figure it out. Cause now you're
[02:28:37.180 --> 02:28:44.620]  chasing, you know, yeah. I mentioned it earlier. I like, um, sound horticulture. They're my favorite
[02:28:44.620 --> 02:28:51.180]  so far. They're, they're unmatched in other, other, other people, in my opinion, the, cause I'm
[02:28:51.180 --> 02:28:56.940]  one that looks at them. I was crazy in the beginning for quantifying the quality of the
[02:28:56.940 --> 02:29:02.620]  products we were using. Nobody was doing that. And so we've looked at all the manufacturers and
[02:29:02.620 --> 02:29:06.220]  nothing compares to what sound horticulture is doing, but I've seen.
[02:29:06.700 --> 02:29:13.180]  Do you, do you, do you, cause actually before we, uh, went live, I was looking up gypsum.
[02:29:13.180 --> 02:29:23.420]  Do you use gypsum? Of course. Yeah. Okay. It's, you know, so like the recipe components are going
[02:29:23.420 --> 02:29:27.260]  to be pretty much the same. It's hard to make a soil without gypsum, without oyster shell,
[02:29:27.260 --> 02:29:32.220]  without soft rock phosphate. Like you're going to need to make those include, or you should be,
[02:29:32.780 --> 02:29:40.300]  in my opinion, you should be including as diverse a blend of products for each aspect. You know,
[02:29:40.300 --> 02:29:44.780]  you don't want to use just oyster shell. You should use a mix of oyster shell and gypsum.
[02:29:45.660 --> 02:29:50.860]  You know, you want to use a mix of nitrogens. So it's going to be really hard to get away from
[02:29:50.860 --> 02:29:56.780]  the standard soil inputs. It's, we really do need to re-examine how we're approaching that
[02:29:56.780 --> 02:30:01.660]  process as a community. And we need to re-examine how we get to the goal. If we want everybody to
[02:30:01.660 --> 02:30:07.020]  have success straight away. Well, and that actually, that actually gets me to the, um,
[02:30:07.020 --> 02:30:13.100]  you know, my assumption is the, the pit moss is just almost all carbon. So what,
[02:30:13.100 --> 02:30:25.100]  what would be good nitrogen sources? Well, um, again, for the home grow kind of like four by four
[02:30:25.100 --> 02:30:31.580]  bed. Totally. Um, this is the most difficult part of living soil cultivation, whether you're
[02:30:32.060 --> 02:30:37.660]  especially in the regulated space. Um, you know, if you're trying to increase just nitrogen,
[02:30:37.660 --> 02:30:42.300]  it's probably a feather meal problem with feather meal is it's high in arsenic. So you can cause a
[02:30:42.300 --> 02:30:50.140]  problem. Um, or like Brandon said, you know, the amino nitrogen, we use that a lot. You want to
[02:30:50.140 --> 02:30:54.700]  really try and balance out fast dissolving and slow dissolving. So feather meal would be my
[02:30:54.700 --> 02:31:00.620]  longer dissolving nitrogen. Soybean amino nitrogen would be my faster nitrogen. So I'm,
[02:31:00.620 --> 02:31:05.820]  I'm always trying to do diversity. I have large chunks of calcium. I find powdered sources of
[02:31:05.820 --> 02:31:13.100]  calcium. I have large chunks of clay. I've find powdered clay. I have fast dissolving nitrogen.
[02:31:13.100 --> 02:31:20.220]  I have slow dissolving nitrogen all based on what that preliminary test said. So when I mix together
[02:31:20.220 --> 02:31:28.940]  my peat moss, cocoa core compost and aeration in the appropriate ratios from that, I take a sample
[02:31:28.940 --> 02:31:34.860]  that's homogenized and I send it into the lab and I have them analysis, analyze the NPK and,
[02:31:34.860 --> 02:31:40.620]  you know, everything from there is what I determine what needs to be put in or how much of what,
[02:31:41.420 --> 02:31:46.380]  you know, the soft rock phosphate is usually pretty standard, you know, but the calcium is
[02:31:46.380 --> 02:31:53.340]  going to change respective to the potassium in the compost that contributes to the resulting soil.
[02:31:53.660 --> 02:31:58.140]  You know, then how much calcium needs to be added to that, to bring it up to the
[02:31:58.140 --> 02:32:04.380]  appropriate ratios above potassium, if that makes sense. So if you're a two by four,
[02:32:05.260 --> 02:32:13.340]  a while ago, wait, sorry, say that. Oh, just saying like, I, you know, I don't mean to sound
[02:32:13.340 --> 02:32:16.380]  too out of reach, but that's if you're in a two by four grow, that's what you should be doing.
[02:32:17.340 --> 02:32:26.460]  In my opinion. So a while ago, John J. Scott asked your opinion on microbial additives like
[02:32:26.460 --> 02:32:33.020]  recharge. I don't know. Let's type in recharge microbial, recharge micro.
[02:32:35.500 --> 02:32:39.260]  And the first question is, can you find out what's in it? You know,
[02:32:40.140 --> 02:32:40.540]  uh,
[02:32:44.940 --> 02:32:51.260]  aha, here we go. He's got one. So it's got amino acids, fulvic acid, humic acid, molasses, kelp,
[02:32:51.260 --> 02:32:59.740]  two types of trichoderma or bacillus and four glomulus. Yeah. Sounds cool. If that's really
[02:33:00.300 --> 02:33:06.860]  what's in there. My, my objection really to any, I mean, it's, I don't know anything about the
[02:33:06.860 --> 02:33:10.220]  product. It sounds like it was a little bit more well thought out than other ones in that they put
[02:33:10.220 --> 02:33:16.460]  some food in there. So that's cool. Um, when it comes to any sort of inoculant product, you know,
[02:33:16.460 --> 02:33:21.180]  since I come from the school of the lane where they qualify you to use a microscope, I check it.
[02:33:21.180 --> 02:33:25.580]  I don't care what anybody on the internet says. The first thing I do is put it up onto a slide
[02:33:25.580 --> 02:33:30.540]  and I look, is there bacteria in there? Is there anywhere near what they're claiming?
[02:33:31.260 --> 02:33:35.820]  You know? Um, and then from there, you got to understand, like, you know, I think the,
[02:33:37.340 --> 02:33:40.860]  the microbiome project turned out some really interesting things and we'll just throw out some
[02:33:40.860 --> 02:33:45.740]  numbers. Like they're estimating there's a hundred thousand species of bacteria.
[02:33:45.740 --> 02:33:51.340]  We've been able to identify through DNA, maybe like 10 to 20% of those. And then,
[02:33:51.340 --> 02:33:56.940]  and then as growers, we focus on products that have six individual species. And so to me,
[02:33:57.740 --> 02:34:03.180]  if I'm making very quality compost or have access to very quality compost, I've got those
[02:34:03.740 --> 02:34:10.140]  20,000, 50,000, a hundred thousand species. Having said that, you know, it still is good
[02:34:10.140 --> 02:34:14.620]  to inoculate with certain products to make sure you have them in there. But community-wide,
[02:34:14.620 --> 02:34:21.100]  we really need to expand our, our mindset as to what, what the goal actually is, you know?
[02:34:21.100 --> 02:34:29.180]  And so to me, if you get a bacterial product and it's six, 12, 13, 18, 20 species, that's fine.
[02:34:29.180 --> 02:34:33.740]  But if there's nothing eating them, you're still waiting for nutrients to become
[02:34:34.700 --> 02:34:38.220]  tied up in a body and then released. And if there's nothing eating it,
[02:34:39.180 --> 02:34:43.100]  the bacteria, you're, you're waiting for those nutrients to become available through,
[02:34:44.940 --> 02:34:53.420]  you know, old age essentially. And so it's, it's being focused on an individual inoculant product
[02:34:54.220 --> 02:35:00.620]  is looking at like one to 5% of the actual capabilities and possibilities if you're
[02:35:00.620 --> 02:35:09.420]  doing a full soil food web. So to me, it's like, like, what's the goal? Is the goal to sprinkle
[02:35:09.420 --> 02:35:14.620]  in a little bit of bacteria or one species or two species? Or are we trying to have the four
[02:35:14.620 --> 02:35:24.540]  system in there? I want the four system. Right. So Steve asks, ratio of NPK in a finished blend?
[02:35:25.980 --> 02:35:32.700]  Well, this is where I also have to say I'm more of a biologically qualified guy than the mineral
[02:35:32.700 --> 02:35:40.140]  expert. But I will say that if you're just starting out, and you aim for the basic Albrecht
[02:35:40.140 --> 02:35:47.260]  amounts, you know, you're aiming for something like 68% calcium, 12% magnesium, and like four
[02:35:47.260 --> 02:35:53.660]  to 7% potassium, like that will be better than what most people are doing. You know, we're starting
[02:35:53.660 --> 02:35:58.860]  to expand out of that you're starting to see other consultants recommend other ratios, you know, a
[02:35:58.860 --> 02:36:03.660]  little bit higher calcium, a little bit lower magnesium and higher potassium, those are then
[02:36:03.660 --> 02:36:10.780]  better, you know, than aiming for the Albrecht standards. But in my experience, the soils that
[02:36:10.780 --> 02:36:16.940]  people are using are so remarkably dysfunctional from a chemistry standpoint, you just have to get
[02:36:16.940 --> 02:36:26.940]  into the lane of, you know, some some amount of ideal balance, right. So and then as far as like
[02:36:26.940 --> 02:36:31.580]  ratios in between that, you know, like you should have 50 to 100 parts per million nitrogen,
[02:36:32.540 --> 02:36:38.860]  you know, sulfur should be close to phosphate, it should be close to potassium. And, you know,
[02:36:38.860 --> 02:36:45.020]  you should have far more calcium than potassium. So smileysgarden asked,
[02:36:47.500 --> 02:36:53.660]  can you read that? Yeah, I don't again, I'm not the I'm not that guy. I can tell you what I can
[02:36:53.660 --> 02:36:58.620]  tell you what populations of bacteria lead to a good outcome as far as what they are. I'm not that
[02:36:58.620 --> 02:37:07.100]  guy. That is what you want to do the slides. I think we can work through some of them. I think
[02:37:07.100 --> 02:37:12.300]  it would help. Yeah, now go for it. You got the screen. You're a master of the screen share,
[02:37:12.300 --> 02:37:17.020]  right? And why you're what I'm gonna let you do that. And I'm gonna do my pee break. And then I'll
[02:37:17.020 --> 02:37:22.140]  I'll be less antsy. Yeah, well, maybe you should talk while I do my pee break.
[02:37:22.140 --> 02:37:30.060]  All right, you want you want to do yours first? Yeah, get some questions. Honestly, I think I'll
[02:37:30.060 --> 02:37:35.660]  be all right. Give me two seconds. Okay. All right. Well, everybody, you get to watch me.
[02:37:40.030 --> 02:37:46.590]  All right, so let's look through some of the questions. And by the way, today's Wednesday,
[02:37:46.590 --> 02:37:57.470]  tomorrow we have a a Duke Diamond fundraiser at 10am Pacific Time.
[02:38:01.150 --> 02:38:10.950]  Tomorrow night, possibly a hash conversation, although I could use a break. But yeah,
[02:38:12.550 --> 02:38:15.190]  I think I had to go to the bathroom more than Scott did. So
[02:38:17.990 --> 02:38:33.660]  anyway, I I'm just gonna throw up some comments. That's right. Free Duke. Let's see what else.
[02:38:37.710 --> 02:38:46.590]  Ah, look at that. We have more fire relief. And Adam, I have your question.
[02:38:46.830 --> 02:39:01.340]  All right, so now it's my turn. Yeah. So queue up your slides. Yep. And then I'm gonna run.
[02:39:06.940 --> 02:39:12.780]  But Adam a while ago asked, Can you inoculate your worm bins and have a supply of HP nematodes
[02:39:12.780 --> 02:39:15.900]  for months or even years to come without purchasing again and again?
[02:39:16.460 --> 02:39:22.380]  Absolutely. That would be advanced level soul food webbing, where you learn how to
[02:39:22.380 --> 02:39:27.260]  prepare, perpetuate and propagate like we do with cloning or other techniques. Absolutely.
[02:39:27.820 --> 02:39:34.460]  And just my question is, like, you know, people always talk about em one. Is that something that
[02:39:34.460 --> 02:39:39.900]  like only this one company in Japan has the special sauce to and like, you got to get it
[02:39:39.900 --> 02:39:47.020]  through them? Or can people create their own version of it? Well, I mean, I'm sure there's
[02:39:47.020 --> 02:39:51.900]  some I believe there is some sort of patenting that goes on. But I think what's important to
[02:39:51.900 --> 02:39:58.380]  understand is that em one is a is a primary species, their early adopter in a new system.
[02:39:58.380 --> 02:40:03.740]  That's why it's so effective, because you're putting in one of the primary species, as we'd
[02:40:03.740 --> 02:40:10.940]  say into the system. I think, you know, I think em one, I call it the gateway drug to living soils.
[02:40:12.220 --> 02:40:19.900]  It gets people into it. But there's just so much more untapped resources above
[02:40:20.780 --> 02:40:27.900]  those types of products. You know, they clearly provide a benefit. But, you know,
[02:40:28.620 --> 02:40:35.420]  but but but like, is that like a designer microbe or something? Or is that a microbe that you could
[02:40:35.420 --> 02:40:41.180]  whip up and keep perpetuating? You told you totally can. That's one of the points. The
[02:40:41.180 --> 02:40:46.700]  problem is, though, as you start to propagate things, you have contamination and variation.
[02:40:46.700 --> 02:40:52.860]  And so you want to monitor it, you know, and we have support. We have support for the idea of the
[02:40:53.340 --> 02:41:01.820]  we'll see. Let me let me cue it up. There it is. This is the Scott and Brandon.
[02:41:03.660 --> 02:41:08.540]  I like Brandon. I never heard of him until that episode. But he said some things that I say.
[02:41:08.540 --> 02:41:12.940]  I love Brandon. And I love I mean, I know you and I know kind of the
[02:41:12.940 --> 02:41:17.340]  the shit you care about and what frustrates you. And I feel like he's
[02:41:18.300 --> 02:41:24.540]  he's he's your ilk. Yeah, I like him. Yeah. I don't know what he means. But I like Brandon.
[02:41:26.140 --> 02:41:33.660]  You guys are like in the same family of. Yeah, yeah. We've both found commercial strategies
[02:41:33.660 --> 02:41:40.860]  that are a type of people or things similar to those already referred to. So you guys are
[02:41:40.860 --> 02:41:46.860]  of the same ilk. There you go. We're elks. We're we're in two very different lanes. But
[02:41:47.500 --> 02:41:51.980]  yeah, you can tell by the things he's saying. I like you guys come at things from a different
[02:41:51.980 --> 02:41:58.700]  you know, it's like you almost came to similar conclusions from like totally different places.
[02:41:58.700 --> 02:42:05.660]  And like you met up with the result. Yeah, I'm sure the results are similar. He's growing at
[02:42:05.660 --> 02:42:10.060]  scale like he has to like those, you know, and I think that's when you pull your hair out. You're
[02:42:10.060 --> 02:42:15.340]  like, yeah, that's cool that it worked in like your six plant grow. But I'm dealing with commercial
[02:42:15.340 --> 02:42:19.980]  farms that like can't fuck up or they go out of business and put 50 people out of work.
[02:42:20.860 --> 02:42:25.820]  Well, not only that, if you're if you're running a four by four or even a four lighter or even an
[02:42:25.820 --> 02:42:33.100]  18 like garage, it's far more easy for you to control problems within that square footage.
[02:42:33.660 --> 02:42:40.780]  If you now square if you now if you now scale to be relying on a lot of times minimum wage
[02:42:40.780 --> 02:42:46.540]  employees, they're not going to be able to contain some of the problems that your chosen
[02:42:46.540 --> 02:42:53.820]  cultivation practices create. And that's I think that's why some people are very unsuccessful scale
[02:42:54.380 --> 02:42:59.660]  and only a few people are very successful scale because, you know, you have to be able to contain
[02:42:59.660 --> 02:43:06.620]  problems or avoid problems through, you know, math or quantifying your nutrient or balancing
[02:43:06.620 --> 02:43:10.620]  the chemistry in the soil and then having cultural practices that don't make it worse.
[02:43:11.900 --> 02:43:17.420]  And, you know, it sounds like, yeah, so. So just quickly, while you're while you're
[02:43:17.420 --> 02:43:25.020]  queuing up your slides, this is something I don't piss my compost, but I definitely piss in my
[02:43:25.500 --> 02:43:34.460]  in my soil. Good or bad? I mean, depends on how much I guess, you know.
[02:43:36.380 --> 02:43:42.540]  It's a moment. It's nitrogen. It's minerals. I think it would hard for it'd be hard for me
[02:43:42.540 --> 02:43:46.940]  to not think about that as I'm putting my hands in it constantly. But I mean,
[02:43:48.700 --> 02:43:52.540]  I'm not asking you to put your hands in my soil after I've pissed in it. But somebody
[02:43:53.260 --> 02:43:58.220]  yes, somebody like Swami. I just I mean, but somebody like Swami would you know, he tells
[02:43:58.220 --> 02:44:03.100]  you to put the seed in your mouth and there's a concept of like the intelligence of that plant
[02:44:03.100 --> 02:44:09.580]  will bring out what you need specifically. So there might be some might be something like that
[02:44:10.220 --> 02:44:17.580]  with the pee on the compost. I just don't. So with all this peace, let me go to the bathroom and.
[02:44:17.740 --> 02:44:18.140]  And.
[02:44:19.820 --> 02:44:28.620]  Wait, don't leave. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Whoops. I'm all YouTube. There we go. Wait, did I do it?
[02:44:29.340 --> 02:44:34.860]  Yeah, but just Yep. So Yep. There you go. There we go. Okay.
[02:44:34.860 --> 02:44:37.740]  Oh, we were we were looking in a mirror of a mirror of a mirror.
[02:44:37.740 --> 02:44:42.860]  Got it. Yeah. Okay. I'll be back. Okay. So you just babble.
[02:44:43.580 --> 02:44:51.420]  Whoo. Okay, so this is this is an adaption of the first workshops we did in person.
[02:44:52.380 --> 02:44:56.460]  You know, I apologize. It took me, you know, four years to get this in more of a digital format,
[02:44:56.460 --> 02:45:01.180]  but that's not really my strength. And so when I have the opportunity, I try to get this out
[02:45:01.180 --> 02:45:06.700]  there for the people that weren't able to come into our in person workshops. And so here's this.
[02:45:06.700 --> 02:45:11.660]  So this is kind of my attempt at explaining the science of living soil systems.
[02:45:13.020 --> 02:45:17.420]  I spoke earlier in the podcast about this paper and its effect that it had on me,
[02:45:17.420 --> 02:45:21.020]  how difficult it was to find, but kind of the opportunities I saw
[02:45:21.580 --> 02:45:28.060]  within the cannabis industry to get tremendous benefit by having predator to prey interactions.
[02:45:28.780 --> 02:45:33.260]  We spoke about that at the beginning of the episode. If you are just tuning in,
[02:45:33.260 --> 02:45:35.820]  you go back to the beginning and we go through this entire paper.
[02:45:37.660 --> 02:45:42.700]  I've pulled out one graph for this purpose because it's the graph that at the time I was reading,
[02:45:42.700 --> 02:45:48.460]  it really had the biggest impact on me. And so it's talking about the above ground biomass
[02:45:48.460 --> 02:45:56.860]  of the plants across the given time. And so, you know, soil was sterilized. It was put into a petri
[02:45:56.860 --> 02:46:02.860]  dish. Grass seeds were grown. Once the seeds were shown to not be contaminated, they transplanted
[02:46:02.860 --> 02:46:09.420]  them into the various petri dishes. And then they started to add different assemblies of organisms
[02:46:09.420 --> 02:46:14.060]  to see their effects on plant growth. So on the left side here, we have above ground biomass in
[02:46:14.060 --> 02:46:19.660]  grams. And then down along the bottoms, we have the hundred days of the study. The black line is
[02:46:19.660 --> 02:46:27.660]  represented by plant in sterile soil. The green line is plant with bacteria. Here we have plant,
[02:46:27.740 --> 02:46:33.260]  bacteria, and fungi. And we have plant, bacteria, and a bacterial feeding nematode.
[02:46:33.260 --> 02:46:38.300]  And then we have plant, bacteria, fungi, and fungal feeding nematode. And so when you overlay
[02:46:38.300 --> 02:46:44.860]  the first line of a plant in sterile soil, periodically they would chop some of the
[02:46:44.860 --> 02:46:48.540]  samples off and weigh the above ground biomass. And that's how they got to this point.
[02:46:50.700 --> 02:46:55.820]  When you start to add the green line, which is plant with bacteria, you start to immediately see
[02:46:56.460 --> 02:47:01.740]  an increase in above ground biomass simply by adding bacteria. Because now we're having
[02:47:01.740 --> 02:47:06.380]  mineralization of the rocks. So we're digesting parent material and turning it into plant
[02:47:06.380 --> 02:47:12.940]  available forms. And then we're storing it in the bodies of bacteria for later use. So that results
[02:47:12.940 --> 02:47:20.460]  in an above ground biomass change. Here we have the plant, bacteria, and fungi. And so this one
[02:47:20.460 --> 02:47:26.140]  really stood out to me because at this time in my journey, it was very difficult to find fungi.
[02:47:26.140 --> 02:47:31.900]  You know, periodically you would see maybe one fungal strand inside of a compost, but pretty
[02:47:31.900 --> 02:47:36.940]  much it wasn't even existing in my world at the time when I read this. And I saw there was a
[02:47:36.940 --> 02:47:43.340]  considerable increase in plant growth very early on by simply adding fungi. And by adding fungi,
[02:47:43.340 --> 02:47:48.460]  we're getting greater soil structure. We're getting more oxygen into the root zone. And if
[02:47:48.460 --> 02:47:52.380]  you've done any other cultivation strategy, you know that oxygen in the root zone is one of the
[02:47:52.380 --> 02:47:59.900]  most important aspects. I put this green line here somewhere around 30 days because when I initially
[02:47:59.900 --> 02:48:05.340]  saw this graph, I thought of the cannabis life cycle. And this is talking about grass, but if
[02:48:05.340 --> 02:48:10.940]  we break down the cannabis life cycle to roughly a hundred days from, you know, a clone striking
[02:48:10.940 --> 02:48:17.980]  roots, there are some similarities. And so when we simply change from plant with bacteria to plant
[02:48:18.060 --> 02:48:23.340]  bacteria and fungi, you almost get a doubling of the above ground biomass at the 30 day mark.
[02:48:23.900 --> 02:48:28.860]  And this really stuck out to me because most people will take a clone or a teen and they'll
[02:48:28.860 --> 02:48:33.500]  transplant it into a soil and they'll let it veg for two, three or four weeks before they start
[02:48:33.500 --> 02:48:38.940]  flipping it to flower. And I saw if I could someday figure out how to get fungi into my system,
[02:48:39.740 --> 02:48:47.100]  I could potentially double the size of my plant going into flower. Or you can back up the calendar
[02:48:47.100 --> 02:48:51.820]  and say, okay, if I've currently been growing with plant and bacteria and I'm expecting,
[02:48:51.820 --> 02:48:55.660]  you know, this slope of, or I haven't been experiencing this slope of plant growth,
[02:48:56.300 --> 02:49:01.980]  I can, and I'm good with that. I can then add fungi to that system and I'll get a bigger plant
[02:49:01.980 --> 02:49:07.420]  that's the same size as what I've been flowering in my old system, you know, 10 days earlier.
[02:49:08.300 --> 02:49:12.380]  And in the first farms that we started working with and started really applying the soil food
[02:49:12.380 --> 02:49:17.340]  web techniques, that's exactly what we saw. On pretty much every living soil farm that we've
[02:49:17.340 --> 02:49:22.940]  ever worked with that was already operating before we got there, we've been able to reduce a week off
[02:49:22.940 --> 02:49:30.620]  their life cycle somewhere, either in the clone to teen stage or in the teen to prepare for flower
[02:49:30.620 --> 02:49:37.420]  stage, or sometimes both. When you start to add plant bacteria and bacterial feeding nematode,
[02:49:37.420 --> 02:49:42.700]  you get a similar slope and jump up in plant growth as the plant and fungi. But over time,
[02:49:42.700 --> 02:49:49.180]  you start to get more. And as I referenced earlier in the podcast, talking about those actual
[02:49:49.180 --> 02:49:55.180]  quantified amounts of nutrients that were produced by adding the bacterial feeding nematode,
[02:49:55.180 --> 02:50:02.060]  most importantly, nitrogen and phosphate. And then finally, you start to add plant bacteria,
[02:50:02.060 --> 02:50:06.940]  fungi and fungal feeding nematode. And again, it has a very similar slope and growth rates to the
[02:50:06.940 --> 02:50:12.140]  other assemblage of organisms. They change slightly throughout the life cycle. But nonetheless,
[02:50:12.140 --> 02:50:19.180]  they're still significantly greater than sterile or with just the bacteria. I put a line here at
[02:50:19.180 --> 02:50:27.660]  the 80 day mark, which in a general sense is the rooted clone to harvest time period. And you can
[02:50:27.660 --> 02:50:36.140]  see that, you know, from plant in a sterile soil at about 140 grams and above ground biomass, you
[02:50:36.140 --> 02:50:41.420]  know, in most of the assemblages here, we have double that. This really grabbed my attention
[02:50:41.420 --> 02:50:47.820]  and really, very legitimately was the reason why I pursued so hard in the work of Dr. Ling when so
[02:50:47.820 --> 02:50:54.140]  many people were against it or provided resistance to it. And, you know, I can't think of a better
[02:50:54.140 --> 02:50:59.980]  way to have spent my life. So finding this paper back then and wanting to chase this goal was
[02:50:59.980 --> 02:51:05.740]  really profound for my own life experience. You can see that in the plant and bacteria
[02:51:06.300 --> 02:51:11.420]  sample at the end of the 100 days, all the assemblages are relatively close together.
[02:51:11.420 --> 02:51:16.540]  And I didn't understand this when I first read this and I didn't understand it until, like I said,
[02:51:16.540 --> 02:51:21.660]  I got through the courses and did well on my tests and got the opportunity to meet Dr. Ling
[02:51:21.660 --> 02:51:26.060]  and work closely with her. And eventually got to the point where, you know, we could have a meal
[02:51:26.060 --> 02:51:30.540]  and drink a couple of beers. And I asked her about this one time, I said, why do these all group
[02:51:30.540 --> 02:51:36.140]  together in biomass towards the end? Shouldn't there be more? And she said, well, keep in mind,
[02:51:36.140 --> 02:51:41.820]  the study is growing grass in a Petri dish for a hundred days. And, you know, there was a point
[02:51:41.820 --> 02:51:49.820]  where root bound Petri dish grass came into play. So, but I think it's important to mention so that
[02:51:49.820 --> 02:51:54.780]  we keep that in mind. If we were to reproduce this in a suitable soil container, that's larger
[02:51:54.780 --> 02:51:59.500]  than you would definitely see these start to continue upward and they would finish considerably
[02:51:59.500 --> 02:52:10.060]  above the plant bacteria and plant sterile soil assemblages. And why this works is a concept
[02:52:10.060 --> 02:52:15.580]  called ecological succession. So ecological succession is a concept where we talk about
[02:52:15.580 --> 02:52:21.500]  the development of an ecosystem from bare rock or parent material or a recently destroyed
[02:52:21.500 --> 02:52:26.860]  ecosystem, maybe through a fire or a flood or something like that. But nonetheless, the
[02:52:26.860 --> 02:52:33.340]  ecosystem is starting over again. And it goes from bare rock, parent material, moves through to early
[02:52:33.340 --> 02:52:39.340]  successional grasses, early successional plants, moves into shrubs and the various types of trees,
[02:52:39.900 --> 02:52:46.300]  ending up at what we would consider an old growth forest. And so the above ground biomass of a given
[02:52:46.300 --> 02:52:53.580]  ecosystem changes dramatically in size and potential and complexity as it moves along
[02:52:53.580 --> 02:53:02.140]  this scale called ecological succession. I think the part that people are really disconnected from
[02:53:02.140 --> 02:53:08.860]  is the concept of ecological succession of the soil organisms that happen below the soil as this
[02:53:08.860 --> 02:53:14.140]  development of an ecosystem happens. And so this graphic is supposed to represent the development
[02:53:14.140 --> 02:53:20.540]  and ratio of soil organisms as the ecosystem develops. And so these blue dots represent
[02:53:20.540 --> 02:53:26.540]  bacteria. And so in the parent early systems, there's bacteria only. We start to get some orange
[02:53:26.540 --> 02:53:33.340]  fungi dots as we move across. Somewhere here in the trees, we start to get equal bacteria to fungi.
[02:53:33.900 --> 02:53:39.980]  And then in old growth forests, we get actually much less bacteria and far greater fungal
[02:53:39.980 --> 02:53:45.340]  dominance. This is what people talk about when they say fungal dominant ecosystem. And then the
[02:53:45.340 --> 02:53:50.380]  green dots are the protozoa. So also, again, in early successional systems, it's just bacteria
[02:53:50.380 --> 02:53:56.460]  with the potential, but nothing really converting those nutrients into plant growth. And then as you
[02:53:56.460 --> 02:54:01.740]  get more complex, you start to get nematodes and the micro arthropods start to shed the various
[02:54:01.740 --> 02:54:07.500]  fungi. When we first started working with Dr. Lane, I asked where does she think cannabis
[02:54:07.500 --> 02:54:14.620]  evolves? And from a basic sense, it's between these two wickets. So in my opinion, I think this
[02:54:14.620 --> 02:54:19.020]  is why a lot of people ended in the Redwood Forest and the Humboldts and what have you,
[02:54:19.020 --> 02:54:25.260]  because they were planting directly into an old growth forest. And so they were planting directly
[02:54:25.340 --> 02:54:34.060]  into a biological system that was similar to this. And in our personal experience, when you move
[02:54:34.060 --> 02:54:42.780]  along this line in succession and really just get anywhere near the targeted ecosystem or balance of
[02:54:42.780 --> 02:54:48.620]  soil organisms that cannabis is likely to have evolved in, really magical things start to happen.
[02:54:49.500 --> 02:54:59.570]  This is an image to try and help people that don't have access to a microscope or can't wrap
[02:54:59.570 --> 02:55:05.250]  their mind around how we can use the microscope to make any determination about the soil. And
[02:55:05.250 --> 02:55:13.730]  it's actually quite easy. So here we're looking at a microscope sample on 400X that would have
[02:55:13.730 --> 02:55:19.890]  come from over here. It's very bacterial dominant, very early successional. We know
[02:55:20.610 --> 02:55:27.170]  it's early successional because right here by the red arrow is a piece of mineral that is clear.
[02:55:28.050 --> 02:55:34.290]  Here we have a piece of mineral that has a brown or tan tint to it. What's happening is the bacteria
[02:55:34.290 --> 02:55:40.770]  are habitating the surface of that mineral, starting the mineralization process. And in
[02:55:40.770 --> 02:55:46.610]  that process, fulvic acid and humic acids are produced. So I know if I don't know anything
[02:55:46.690 --> 02:55:54.050]  about this system or if I don't know anything else about this soil, and I put up a sample on
[02:55:54.050 --> 02:55:58.370]  the slide and I can look in here, I can already start to make assumptions about the development
[02:55:58.370 --> 02:56:05.650]  of this ecosystem, saying that it's a primary ecosystem because we don't even have a complete
[02:56:05.650 --> 02:56:12.370]  inoculation of the mineral components with bacteria. So what else starts to happen is the
[02:56:12.370 --> 02:56:19.090]  bacteria sticks to the minerals and they start to form alkaline glues. Once that happens,
[02:56:19.090 --> 02:56:24.610]  all these little bits start to stick together and form microaggregation, which I think is happening
[02:56:24.610 --> 02:56:29.490]  here. It's a little bit out of focus, but you can start to see that the little bits start to clump
[02:56:29.490 --> 02:56:35.410]  together. This is the first stages of soil system development and soil structure development that
[02:56:35.490 --> 02:56:42.450]  leads to oxygen in the root zone. This sample is a little bit further along in the ecosystem,
[02:56:42.450 --> 02:56:47.490]  and you can see right away that clearly, even if you have no experience, there's a visual difference
[02:56:47.490 --> 02:56:57.330]  in the two slides. In this sample, everything's really dispersed. Everything's spread out.
[02:56:57.330 --> 02:57:02.930]  Nothing's really sticking together. When we start to incorporate fungi, which is pointed to by this
[02:57:02.930 --> 02:57:08.690]  green arrow, well now all the little aggregates start to get glued together and we form macro
[02:57:08.690 --> 02:57:13.970]  aggregation. When we form macro aggregation, we start to pull all these little bits together and
[02:57:13.970 --> 02:57:21.570]  it forms pore space for root zone. It creates pore space for oxygen and the system typically
[02:57:21.570 --> 02:57:30.450]  really starts to take off. This blue arrow is pointing to actinobacteria, which is a type of
[02:57:30.450 --> 02:57:36.690]  bacteria that will link end to end like a chain and form filamentous hyphae like the fungi.
[02:57:37.330 --> 02:57:42.130]  We know it's an actinobacteria because bacteria are some of the smallest things that you can
[02:57:42.130 --> 02:57:48.530]  really make out at the 400 times magnification like this is. You know it's an actinobacteria
[02:57:48.530 --> 02:57:54.290]  versus another type of fungi when it's really hard to get it into focus. A lot of the bacteria go in
[02:57:54.290 --> 02:58:01.410]  and out of focus very quickly on the microscope. It almost looks like light bending in a mirror
[02:58:01.410 --> 02:58:07.090]  or a piece of glass or on water or something like that. As you get better with the microscope,
[02:58:07.090 --> 02:58:12.370]  it gets easy to identify these things. We know this is a beneficial fungi from certain
[02:58:12.370 --> 02:58:17.730]  characteristics. It's a little hard to see in this image, but there are little septa here.
[02:58:18.370 --> 02:58:23.970]  They're like railroad tracks. In what we would determine beneficial fungi for the sake of this
[02:58:24.210 --> 02:58:32.450]  quantification, we want these septa to be an even distance apart. We also want the side of the hyphae
[02:58:32.450 --> 02:58:38.530]  to be a consistent distance apart, literally just like railroad tracks. We know through other
[02:58:38.530 --> 02:58:46.130]  scientific research that beneficial saprophytic fungi behave in a certain way. They'll form a cell
[02:58:46.690 --> 02:58:53.010]  and they'll move their little internal ooze into that cell. They'll create off another hypha wall.
[02:58:53.170 --> 02:58:59.170]  When they go to grow, they'll create another one. They do it in these blocks. Other types of fungi
[02:58:59.170 --> 02:59:03.570]  that we would put more into the undesirable category do not form their bodies in that way.
[02:59:05.410 --> 02:59:12.290]  This is a sample that I took from a pretty established old growth forest. I took this
[02:59:12.290 --> 02:59:18.690]  sample before I was really able to quantify specifically. This was really early on,
[02:59:18.690 --> 02:59:24.210]  one of the first pictures I took when I got into microscopes. I would guess this is like a five to
[02:59:24.210 --> 02:59:29.410]  one fungal to bacteria ratio or something. This just happens to be a zoomed in extremely,
[02:59:29.410 --> 02:59:35.250]  extremely fungal component. We can see that there's a tremendous amount of these fungal hyphae
[02:59:35.250 --> 02:59:40.370]  that when we follow the characteristics that Dr. Lane sets for it, it's easy to tell that this is
[02:59:40.370 --> 02:59:45.970]  something we put into the beneficial category. You can see that the sidewalls are very consistent
[02:59:45.970 --> 02:59:52.370]  in width. There are little septa here that are dividing those cells. You can see everything is
[02:59:52.370 --> 02:59:59.490]  very pulled in together. We've got big aggregate here. We've got some aggregate here and a ton
[02:59:59.490 --> 03:00:07.170]  of extra space. That extra space is filled up with oxygen and roots and big ass fruits.
[03:00:07.330 --> 03:00:13.970]  This is a fungi that we would actually put into the oomycete category. We would put it in the
[03:00:13.970 --> 03:00:21.250]  bottom of our soil test in the undesirable category. We can tell this guy by it is forming a hyphae.
[03:00:21.250 --> 03:00:26.850]  It is forming something that we would call fungi that most people might recognize.
[03:00:26.850 --> 03:00:33.810]  Where I start to get concerned about this guy is it's a very irregular width of the hyphae itself.
[03:00:33.890 --> 03:00:46.690]  There's no septa. It's clear. The beneficial fungi are decomposing carbon and other compounds
[03:00:46.690 --> 03:00:53.010]  producing humic acid. That humic acid and fulvic acid starts to tint the fungi. A lot of the
[03:00:53.970 --> 03:01:00.130]  beneficial fungi will be light tanned, dark brown. Sometimes they're wild colors like pink or blue,
[03:01:00.130 --> 03:01:07.090]  but very rare or less rare. They're mostly a tan. This guy is very clear.
[03:01:08.130 --> 03:01:15.090]  This type of animal recently got reclassified from a fungi to actually a protozoa, which is
[03:01:15.090 --> 03:01:20.930]  really interesting. From my understanding, it's not even really in the fungal community. As
[03:01:20.930 --> 03:01:27.330]  cannabis growers, we believe this guy right here is the goal. My personal research and experience
[03:01:27.330 --> 03:01:33.490]  shows that this is actually the number one cause for powdery mildew and pest disease issues.
[03:01:34.530 --> 03:01:39.570]  Here's a bacterial feeding nematode, which we've talked about earlier. The blue arrow points to the
[03:01:39.570 --> 03:01:46.370]  mouthpieces. If we know what this animal is trying to do, we can understand what type it is by what
[03:01:46.370 --> 03:01:51.170]  its little body parts look like. This guy is a bacterial feeding nematode. We know it's a
[03:01:51.170 --> 03:01:55.650]  bacterial feeding nematode because it's got a little tube here for vacuuming up bacteria.
[03:01:56.450 --> 03:02:02.130]  Other fungi might have a little poker in here or some crazy looking mouth parts.
[03:02:03.170 --> 03:02:09.970]  Bacterial feeding nematodes will always have one or two bulbs. This bulb right here is actually
[03:02:09.970 --> 03:02:14.450]  where they squish up the bacteria. If this was a video, you'd actually be able to see this little
[03:02:14.450 --> 03:02:21.570]  guy going pumping like a heart. By these various characteristics, we know that this is a bacterial
[03:02:21.570 --> 03:02:26.210]  feeding nematode. If you've got some of the HB nematodes, which I spoke about earlier,
[03:02:26.210 --> 03:02:30.690]  the heterobditis, those can be a little bit harder to identify than this guy.
[03:02:32.450 --> 03:02:38.130]  This bulb right here is very easy to see, but this front bulb is a little bit harder to see
[03:02:38.130 --> 03:02:42.210]  or sometimes very difficult to see. The mouth parts are a little less pronounced.
[03:02:43.490 --> 03:02:48.450]  If you get both the steiner nema and the heterobditis nematodes at the same time,
[03:02:48.450 --> 03:02:52.850]  and you create a water solution, put a sample onto a slide and look at it,
[03:02:52.850 --> 03:02:59.250]  they are very different. You can usually tell which one is which. Believe it or not, a lot of
[03:02:59.250 --> 03:03:05.650]  times the labs get them mixed up. For clients, a lot of times we'll check them beforehand to
[03:03:05.650 --> 03:03:11.970]  make sure we're even putting in what we think we are. This is a slide that I borrowed from David
[03:03:11.970 --> 03:03:17.170]  Johnson, who in some ways is carrying on some of the soil food web work that Dr. Lane did in the
[03:03:17.170 --> 03:03:22.050]  university setting. You can go find some of his stuff on YouTube and you can find this entire
[03:03:22.050 --> 03:03:27.570]  presentation on YouTube, which is pretty interesting. What this one image is showing
[03:03:27.570 --> 03:03:34.290]  is various fungal to bacteria ratios that they created in the soil by mixing compost into soil.
[03:03:35.250 --> 03:03:39.890]  The compost had high fungal populations and when they blended it with the other potting soil,
[03:03:39.890 --> 03:03:44.290]  they then did a microscope analysis and came up with different fungal to bacteria ratios.
[03:03:44.930 --> 03:03:49.330]  I do want to caution and say that fungal to bacteria ratios aren't everything,
[03:03:49.330 --> 03:03:53.010]  but if we're going to start moving the consciousness of the community forward,
[03:03:53.010 --> 03:03:57.730]  we need to start with something that we can all wrap our minds around. The fungi to bacteria
[03:03:57.730 --> 03:04:03.410]  ratio is a pretty easy starting point because you're talking about taking the fungal biomass
[03:04:03.410 --> 03:04:10.370]  and dividing it by the bacterial biomass to come up with a ratio. In the situation here of a 0.04,
[03:04:11.330 --> 03:04:17.810]  that means that the bacteria is far higher than the fungi because we're dividing fungi by bacteria
[03:04:17.810 --> 03:04:22.770]  to get a number. If it's greater than one, that means the fungal populations is higher than the
[03:04:22.770 --> 03:04:29.410]  bacterial populations. Here we're significantly low in fungal contents to bacterial contents.
[03:04:29.410 --> 03:04:38.050]  We get a 0.04 on up to a much greater 3.6 times the fungal biomass to bacterial biomass.
[03:04:38.050 --> 03:04:41.810]  In this situation, I think they're using a bell bean or something like that, but
[03:04:42.770 --> 03:04:49.170]  in our cannabis work, this is definitely part of the phenomenon. Fungal to bacteria ratios also
[03:04:49.170 --> 03:04:56.050]  usually indicate stability of the system or age of the system. It's hard to get a high fungal to
[03:04:56.050 --> 03:05:01.650]  bacteria ratio in the beginning of a system because the bacteria grow much faster. It's
[03:05:01.650 --> 03:05:06.450]  hard to correct that fungal to bacteria ratio if we're doing something that inhibits fungal growth.
[03:05:08.050 --> 03:05:12.210]  When I first started doing the microscope analysis for people through social media,
[03:05:13.970 --> 03:05:21.490]  for the first couple years of that work, the most common fungal to bacteria ratios we see are 0.09
[03:05:21.490 --> 03:05:29.490]  to 0.12. I'm not sure why mathematically those pop out the most often, but in my personal experience,
[03:05:29.490 --> 03:05:35.330]  I've seen those numbers very commonly. Even people that you believe are doing very well with
[03:05:36.290 --> 03:05:43.250]  living soil, it's likely they're less than a 0.2 F to B ratio. For cannabis, my belief is it should
[03:05:43.250 --> 03:05:52.610]  be somewhere greater than 0.75 over one. It's hard to get a farm above one at this stage in the game,
[03:05:52.610 --> 03:05:57.890]  but we're getting more and more clients to get above that. For the first couple of years I did
[03:05:57.890 --> 03:06:06.450]  that, the highest F to B ratio I got from a sample that was outside of our client base was a 0.23.
[03:06:06.450 --> 03:06:13.810]  That 0.23 was the highest for almost two years. After we did a couple workshops and started
[03:06:13.810 --> 03:06:20.210]  connecting people with our compost, we started seeing that fungal to bacteria ratio increase.
[03:06:20.210 --> 03:06:27.090]  I would still say community-wide on a fungal to bacteria ratio by itself, most people are over
[03:06:27.090 --> 03:06:35.490]  here near the 0.04, significantly less than 1.0, which would be far less than cannabis
[03:06:36.690 --> 03:06:45.410]  theoretically naturally evolved in. This is a quick representation of pH, which is something
[03:06:45.410 --> 03:06:51.330]  we are familiar with. Some people would say we're looking for a 6.4 goal or 6.0 goal or what have
[03:06:51.330 --> 03:06:59.010]  you. Nonetheless, ideal sways alkaline. We sway towards alkaline away from ideal, and we can sway
[03:06:59.010 --> 03:07:06.850]  towards acid away from ideal. This is a concept that most people are familiar with. If we move to
[03:07:06.850 --> 03:07:13.250]  concentrations of oxygen, they still have a similar scale where we're looking for somewhere
[03:07:13.250 --> 03:07:20.770]  ideal and we can vary to greater oxygen levels or to less oxygen levels away from what we would
[03:07:20.770 --> 03:07:30.050]  determine ideal. An environment that's high in oxygen would be called aerobic. An environment
[03:07:30.050 --> 03:07:35.490]  that is low in oxygen is called anaerobic. An environment free of oxygen would be called
[03:07:35.490 --> 03:07:44.050]  anoxic. My personal preference is we're looking for as high as oxygen in the root zone based on
[03:07:44.050 --> 03:07:49.810]  what I learned in hydroponics in regards to plant health, root growth, and overall output.
[03:07:50.850 --> 03:07:55.970]  It's my personal opinion that most people that believe that organics can't keep up with
[03:07:56.530 --> 03:08:02.930]  hydroponics is simply because it's much easier to get higher levels of dissolved oxygen into a
[03:08:02.930 --> 03:08:09.330]  hydroponic system than it is in a living soil system or a soil system unless you harness the
[03:08:09.330 --> 03:08:15.330]  capabilities of a true soil food web system. Once you do that, then the oxygen levels get very high.
[03:08:16.290 --> 03:08:20.450]  If we add a layer on top of that, we can put this word we've heard a couple times,
[03:08:20.450 --> 03:08:26.930]  the facultative anaerobic zone. Nature has organisms that are very specialized. Some
[03:08:26.930 --> 03:08:32.930]  organisms only function over here in the very high oxygen. Once oxygen starts to decrease,
[03:08:32.930 --> 03:08:38.930]  they go into a dormant state. If it happens very rapidly, they die or science would say lice.
[03:08:39.730 --> 03:08:45.330]  In the center here, we have the facultative anaerobic zone. This is like right now we're
[03:08:45.330 --> 03:08:52.610]  changing presidents and we have what they call a transition team. When we go from whatever side
[03:08:52.610 --> 03:08:59.170]  you want to call a Republican or Democrat, in the center, we've got a transition team that
[03:08:59.970 --> 03:09:07.330]  helps so we don't have this hard line. Interestingly enough, NATs are always found
[03:09:07.890 --> 03:09:13.650]  when there's a high population of facultative anaerobes because they want to deposit their
[03:09:13.650 --> 03:09:18.450]  babies or their larva where there's an abundance of anaerobic bacteria, which are their food.
[03:09:19.250 --> 03:09:24.290]  If you have an abundance of NATs in your system, that's a pretty good indication that you're
[03:09:24.290 --> 03:09:29.330]  predominantly operating in this facultative anaerobic zone. Then if you go here from
[03:09:29.330 --> 03:09:35.250]  whatever would be the center to more anaerobic, all the disease and root pathogens, from my
[03:09:35.250 --> 03:09:42.930]  understanding, happen on this side. We can completely avoid root zone pathogens by staying
[03:09:42.930 --> 03:09:48.690]  above in this aerobic zone. That's something that Dr. Lane made claim to. That's something that I've
[03:09:48.690 --> 03:09:57.090]  personally seen in my own work. It's very common that you'll see spores to disease-causing fungi.
[03:09:57.650 --> 03:10:04.290]  The number of spores you see in a given sample can give you an indication of how long that soil
[03:10:04.290 --> 03:10:09.570]  or how recently that soil has been anaerobic. If they're not functioning, that means that those
[03:10:09.570 --> 03:10:14.530]  spores were created at some point under some conditions, but you're not currently operating
[03:10:14.530 --> 03:10:22.660]  under that, which is pretty interesting. Then on top of that, I tried to layer some colors that
[03:10:22.660 --> 03:10:29.700]  will make more sense as we move on to some of the later slides. Essentially, this green indicates
[03:10:29.700 --> 03:10:35.780]  that we're within the minimum set by Dr. Lane. Blue indicates that we exceed them in a beneficial way
[03:10:36.420 --> 03:10:41.780]  Orange means that we're below the standards set by Dr. Lane and red means we're either
[03:10:41.780 --> 03:10:47.460]  dysfunctionally high or extremely low. In my personal experience, the more aerobic you get
[03:10:47.460 --> 03:10:52.260]  and the more green and blue boxes you get on our soil test, you'll have healthier plants.
[03:10:52.820 --> 03:10:58.500]  The further we get into the anaerobic zone, you definitely see worse pests. Definitely.
[03:11:00.340 --> 03:11:04.900]  This is one where I overlaid some of the outcomes that we've seen. Like I said, we've worked
[03:11:04.900 --> 03:11:10.260]  with literally hundreds of farms. We've worked with millions of square feet of cultivation space,
[03:11:10.260 --> 03:11:15.380]  large and small, local and international. There are some very common patterns.
[03:11:16.340 --> 03:11:21.460]  One of the most common patterns that I see is the most consistent is thrips. Thrips seems to always
[03:11:21.460 --> 03:11:28.900]  happen in a soil system that is either having major disruptions in water, which also lends
[03:11:28.900 --> 03:11:34.900]  itself to disruptions in biology. You'll have not anaerobic, but not high enough
[03:11:36.180 --> 03:11:42.500]  beneficial soil organisms. In my personal interpretation, thrips in a living soil system
[03:11:42.500 --> 03:11:48.180]  is an indication that nutrient delivery is not happening fast enough because of low nutrient
[03:11:48.180 --> 03:11:54.260]  cycling rates. Of course, we have gnats right in the middle. Spider mites are slightly more
[03:11:54.260 --> 03:12:00.340]  anaerobic. Moles are slightly more anaerobic. And then any russet mite, broad mite, root aphids are
[03:12:00.980 --> 03:12:08.580]  remarkably anaerobic or have an extreme environmental condition that are leading to
[03:12:08.580 --> 03:12:13.140]  the same type of nutritional disruptions that happen during this type of environment.
[03:12:13.140 --> 03:12:18.580]  Then over here, we've got 30% total cannabinoids. We've now worked with a handful of farms that
[03:12:18.660 --> 03:12:25.540]  have gotten into the 30s, mid 30s, and now high 30s. A couple of those farms are starting to break
[03:12:25.540 --> 03:12:30.500]  into the 40% total cannabinoids, which when we first started doing that, people would interrupt
[03:12:30.500 --> 03:12:34.900]  that statement with, you're lying. It was so unbelievable for them. But we've now done it in
[03:12:34.900 --> 03:12:39.300]  about five or six facilities in regulated states that are getting state-mandated testing.
[03:12:40.500 --> 03:12:45.780]  And then if you get much higher than people are used to, you get what I call fish stories,
[03:12:45.780 --> 03:12:54.660]  which are outcomes and results that nobody believes, like 10% return on GMO or whatnot.
[03:12:54.660 --> 03:12:56.420]  People don't believe that, but it definitely happens.
[03:12:59.620 --> 03:13:05.140]  This is a slide that I've been using since the first workshop I put together. And this was a
[03:13:05.140 --> 03:13:16.340]  sample that came to us in early 2016. This is an old version of our soil sample data.
[03:13:16.340 --> 03:13:19.940]  On the left side here, you've got all the organisms we're counting, which are bacteria,
[03:13:19.940 --> 03:13:26.260]  fungi, F to B ratio. The amoebae and the flagellates are the beneficial predators or
[03:13:26.260 --> 03:13:32.020]  aerobic predators of bacteria. And then we have nematodes. Actinobacteria is a good thing,
[03:13:32.020 --> 03:13:36.900]  but it also is an indication of decreased oxygen. So we put it down below in the anaerobic
[03:13:36.900 --> 03:13:43.140]  indicators next to ciliates, which ciliates are the anaerobic or decreased oxygen predators of
[03:13:43.140 --> 03:13:50.500]  bacteria. And the oomycetes are that clear fungi or the water molds. These numbers are the
[03:13:52.020 --> 03:13:58.980]  ranges that Dr. Lane Ingham has determined in her four decades of research. And in our experience,
[03:13:59.700 --> 03:14:03.940]  they're pretty dead on. We've made our own slight adjustments to them in the commercial cannabis
[03:14:03.940 --> 03:14:09.860]  space into certain things. But in essence, what she's saying is definitely spot on from what I'm
[03:14:09.860 --> 03:14:16.820]  saying or what we're seeing. And again, so a blue box indicates that this value exceeds in a
[03:14:16.820 --> 03:14:24.340]  beneficial way, the ideal minimum range. Green box means that it's within the ideal range. Orange box
[03:14:24.340 --> 03:14:31.140]  is low and red is either extremely dysfunctionally low or extremely dysfunctionally high. And in this
[03:14:31.140 --> 03:14:37.540]  certain example, there was a regulated facility in a legal state that had three different flowering
[03:14:37.540 --> 03:14:44.020]  rooms and they had russet mites. And so we sampled each of those rooms. What you find here,
[03:14:45.540 --> 03:14:51.620]  when you compare it to a healthy yield, you see extremely low bacteria levels and you see
[03:14:51.620 --> 03:14:59.700]  extremely high ciliates and oomycete levels. In this particular example, and I will say it took
[03:14:59.700 --> 03:15:04.660]  me a while to really figure out what the russet mite biological passport was being created by,
[03:15:04.660 --> 03:15:09.060]  because it didn't make sense to me. It didn't make sense how you could have such high populations
[03:15:09.060 --> 03:15:14.180]  here, but such low populations here. And essentially what's happening in this situation
[03:15:14.180 --> 03:15:20.420]  is this farm was following bad tea brewing advice. They were using a tea brewer that in no way would
[03:15:20.420 --> 03:15:27.620]  they be able to create a healthy tea as per defined by Dr. Lane Ingham. And so that led to a
[03:15:27.620 --> 03:15:33.460]  lot of pest issues. So in this situation, this farm was using a microbutanol and Avid to control the
[03:15:34.500 --> 03:15:41.220]  biblical mold and russet mite populations. And so the russet mites, a lot of times you have the
[03:15:41.220 --> 03:15:47.780]  intro introduction of very anaerobic and high populations of anaerobic organisms from tea
[03:15:47.780 --> 03:15:53.540]  brewing or other processes like that. And then the beneficial bacteria and fungi are being lowered
[03:15:53.540 --> 03:16:00.900]  by the application of IPM products. In this situation, this is a sample from an employee
[03:16:00.900 --> 03:16:06.740]  that worked at this facility. This particular facility was pretty influenced by the people
[03:16:06.740 --> 03:16:11.940]  they were getting their information from, and they weren't honestly open to our corrections or
[03:16:11.940 --> 03:16:19.060]  considering that their tea brewing could be the absolute cause of their russet mite and mold.
[03:16:19.060 --> 03:16:23.380]  So the employee contacted us and asked, you know, how do I stop the russet mites from coming
[03:16:23.940 --> 03:16:29.300]  home with me? So we stopped the tea brewing processes, made a couple changes, and then took
[03:16:29.300 --> 03:16:34.820]  a sample, and this was the outcome. So by simply not spraying with microbutanol and Avid, and by
[03:16:34.820 --> 03:16:41.380]  not doing the extremely dysfunctional tea brewing strategies of this farm, we were able to minimize
[03:16:41.380 --> 03:16:48.420]  ciliates and omeicetes to zero. We're now at 500 and 300 fungi, which is within the minimum range.
[03:16:48.420 --> 03:16:53.620]  It's still low, but it's adequate to get a decent yield. And then we have high levels of nutrient
[03:16:53.620 --> 03:16:59.860]  cycling organisms. So essentially we've got no disease pressure with extremely fast delivery of
[03:16:59.860 --> 03:17:05.380]  nutrients with adequate stability of the system, which is remarkably different from the russet mite
[03:17:05.380 --> 03:17:11.060]  example. And what's interesting, I don't want to get too big on my soapbox, but you know, there's
[03:17:11.060 --> 03:17:15.380]  people in the community that give advice that's extremely detrimental to farmers. And one of the
[03:17:15.380 --> 03:17:22.340]  reasons why I use this old slide is like a ring on a tree of when this advice was given and how long
[03:17:22.340 --> 03:17:26.740]  it takes to change it. And I'm going to continue using this slide until the advice changes.
[03:17:27.540 --> 03:17:33.620]  I talked directly to the influencer that advised this farm on their tea brewing. I've talked to
[03:17:33.620 --> 03:17:39.140]  him in person twice. I've sent very lengthy emails years ago, and they still haven't changed their
[03:17:39.140 --> 03:17:44.340]  advice market-wide. And it's extremely destructive to the community. It's putting farms out of
[03:17:44.340 --> 03:17:49.940]  business. And it's just really time everybody wake up and figure out what is working and what's not
[03:17:49.940 --> 03:18:00.900]  working. And this is a comparison of four different outcomes from around the same time period.
[03:18:00.900 --> 03:18:05.700]  So again, we have the healthy yield. So we're meeting the minimums for bacteria and fungi in
[03:18:05.700 --> 03:18:11.540]  a positive way. Our F to B ratio is a 0.6, which is suitable. We have extremely high levels of
[03:18:11.540 --> 03:18:16.580]  amoebae and flagellates, which is leading to a tremendous speed and delivery of nutrients that
[03:18:16.580 --> 03:18:22.820]  leads to good plant growth without pests. This particular sample hit one gram per watt on a 600
[03:18:22.820 --> 03:18:31.780]  watt Govita in a tent with a pretty new grower. Here we've got the spider mites. So spider mites
[03:18:31.780 --> 03:18:36.340]  has very high bacteria. So that's good. We've got good stability of the system in form of nutrient
[03:18:36.340 --> 03:18:42.500]  potential. We're low on fungi, which means limited oxygen in the root zone, which is compromising our
[03:18:42.500 --> 03:18:49.460]  F to B ratio. Here's that 0.04. We have acceptable levels of amoebae and flagellates, which is
[03:18:49.460 --> 03:18:53.860]  interesting because in the spider mite example, you'll still get good growth. You'll still get
[03:18:53.860 --> 03:19:00.660]  good yield. But down here, the key is the ciliates and the omicetes. We're going to run into pest
[03:19:00.660 --> 03:19:05.700]  pressure with these. The ciliates are releasing nitrogen in the wrong form for the flowering
[03:19:05.700 --> 03:19:12.420]  cannabis plant. So it's like if you're supplementing with the grow formula during bloom, which if you
[03:19:12.420 --> 03:19:18.340]  do that in any example, you're going to end up with mold or mites. Ideally, this omicete value,
[03:19:18.340 --> 03:19:27.220]  back in 2016, when I made this, our goal was to be 25% of this beneficial fungi value or less.
[03:19:27.220 --> 03:19:33.060]  You can see here we're at 50%. So that's problematic. And then if you compare that to
[03:19:33.060 --> 03:19:38.420]  the mold, so very similar. We've got good stability of bacteria. We got about half the
[03:19:38.420 --> 03:19:45.220]  fungi we need. But if you look down here, we have double the omicete value of the beneficial fungi.
[03:19:46.420 --> 03:19:53.540]  This mold passport is the most, in my opinion, the most predictable thing in all of cannabis.
[03:19:53.540 --> 03:20:00.740]  We have done so much evaluation of moldy or plants that are showing visible signs of powdery
[03:20:00.740 --> 03:20:09.220]  mildew. And I mean, 99 out of 100 times, it's because of this. That one out of 100 times where
[03:20:09.220 --> 03:20:15.220]  it's not this is an environmental issue. But the environmental issue will also have an effect
[03:20:15.220 --> 03:20:21.540]  on organisms and it will still trend towards this. And then again, we compare the russet mite example
[03:20:22.100 --> 03:20:27.620]  and the russet mite mold and spider mites. The very common theme is we have
[03:20:28.660 --> 03:20:35.700]  very high levels of ciliates and very high levels of omicetes, which leads to various pests and
[03:20:35.700 --> 03:20:40.740]  disease pressure. I'm not necessarily asserting that these numbers will always lead to this
[03:20:40.740 --> 03:20:46.660]  outcome because there's still the concept of soil chemistry. There's still the concept of
[03:20:46.660 --> 03:20:53.380]  genetic potential. There's still the concept of the feeding strategies you're taking having
[03:20:53.380 --> 03:20:59.300]  effect on outcome. But they're pretty damn close. I'm not going to lie. I get a lot of I get a lot
[03:20:59.300 --> 03:21:04.020]  of resistance to this concept, but I promise you more people are going to be on to this because
[03:21:04.660 --> 03:21:09.940]  this is something we figured out in 2016 and it continues to be extremely accurate in outcome.
[03:21:10.420 --> 03:21:17.940]  And then this was a comparison I made. This is our newest version of our report. So now we have
[03:21:17.940 --> 03:21:23.220]  the organisms, so the nutrient storage, we've got the beneficial bacteria, actinobacteria,
[03:21:23.220 --> 03:21:28.820]  total fungi. We've got now the diameter of a hyphae on our report because it's important to know
[03:21:29.620 --> 03:21:35.540]  what size fungi are in there because the better the fungi typically the wider they are. F to B
[03:21:36.500 --> 03:21:41.380]  ratio. We've now separated out the bacterial feeding, fungal feeding and predatory nematodes
[03:21:41.380 --> 03:21:47.300]  so we can keep track of what predatory nematodes we have or how that breaks out. And then we've
[03:21:47.300 --> 03:21:53.380]  got the root feeding nematodes down here. This was an example I put together to show the variation
[03:21:53.380 --> 03:21:58.420]  in compost that's available to people on the market and how difficult it is to reach a true
[03:21:58.420 --> 03:22:05.460]  soil food web goal with the compost available. So these are three samples of compost taken from
[03:22:05.940 --> 03:22:11.940]  data sets we have combined with the numbers we have in the compost we produce and have been
[03:22:11.940 --> 03:22:18.500]  producing. To my knowledge, Sarah and I were the first people to get to large commercial volumes
[03:22:18.500 --> 03:22:24.980]  of really what we would consider biologically complete compost, meaning adequate and high
[03:22:24.980 --> 03:22:32.100]  levels of beneficial aerobic organisms, appropriate levels of nutrient cycling organisms with low or
[03:22:32.100 --> 03:22:37.780]  non-existent levels of ciliates and omeicetes. You can see in these other examples, you know,
[03:22:37.780 --> 03:22:45.380]  we've got dysfunctionally high bacteria here. We've got nowhere near adequate fungi, which is
[03:22:45.380 --> 03:22:53.780]  equal to the omeicetes in all samples down there. A lot of zeros and most importantly right here,
[03:22:53.780 --> 03:22:58.740]  the nutrient cycling. And so you can provide benefit by adding one of these composts, but
[03:22:58.740 --> 03:23:04.900]  you're going to have slower growth. You're going to have pest and mold pressure. And so, you know,
[03:23:04.900 --> 03:23:10.420]  we are starting to see more people produce what we would consider biologically complete compost,
[03:23:10.420 --> 03:23:15.540]  and it's becoming more available. But if you're into living soil, I really encourage you to
[03:23:15.540 --> 03:23:21.140]  reach out to somebody that is actually producing biologically complete compost. There's only a few
[03:23:21.140 --> 03:23:26.820]  of us, but you should get some of this in your hand. I'm pretty proud of the fact of the work
[03:23:26.820 --> 03:23:32.500]  that we did to get into this because, you know, we spent three years developing our process to end
[03:23:32.500 --> 03:23:38.020]  up with biologically complete compost. And I, you know, I'm really proud of these numbers. I'm
[03:23:38.820 --> 03:23:42.820]  not sure that there's anybody else that's really producing numbers this high. So I'm pretty proud
[03:23:42.820 --> 03:23:48.820]  of that. We're not the only ones, but we're definitely doing some good shit in my opinion.
[03:23:48.900 --> 03:23:51.300]  Whoa, that's crazy. Mirror, mirror, mirror, mirror.
[03:23:56.110 --> 03:24:04.990]  Ah, there we go. I think we lost Peter. I hope that was good. I hope I made sense. I hope you enjoyed.
[03:24:07.550 --> 03:24:09.550]  I don't know what to do now that Peter's not here.
[03:24:14.760 --> 03:24:21.240]  I guess I could try and find some comments. A lot of talk about avocado tech, which is cool.
[03:24:24.440 --> 03:24:30.520]  Yeah. So I guess we'll just sit here awkwardly and stare at each other until Peter returns.
[03:24:31.480 --> 03:24:39.840]  Peter. I guess, does anybody have any questions on that?
[03:24:44.020 --> 03:24:44.900]  And there I am.
[03:24:51.700 --> 03:24:52.740]  Blue is digging it.
[03:24:54.660 --> 03:24:56.580]  That's the avocado tech guy, right? Blue green.
[03:24:56.580 --> 03:24:58.420]  That is blue. You've talked to blue.
[03:24:59.220 --> 03:25:00.020]  Yeah, he's a cool dude.
[03:25:02.420 --> 03:25:08.660]  Blue will come back on soon. I mean, there are questions from a long time ago.
[03:25:09.380 --> 03:25:10.820]  Yeah. Talked for a minute.
[03:25:11.940 --> 03:25:17.380]  People are talking worms and eggshells, digest compost. They were talking worm bins and
[03:25:18.500 --> 03:25:19.540]  compost stuff.
[03:25:20.340 --> 03:25:24.740]  I think it's important with the concept. There's a lot of misconception about what's good for
[03:25:24.740 --> 03:25:30.900]  Soil Food Web based on worm population increases. And there's certain techniques that lead to an
[03:25:30.900 --> 03:25:34.740]  increase in worms, but I don't think it's necessarily a good thing. And that's kind of
[03:25:34.740 --> 03:25:39.780]  why I like the avocado tech because it's not detrimental. It's just increasing their populations.
[03:25:39.780 --> 03:25:44.500]  There's other things that you can do that will increase worm populations, but it's because you
[03:25:44.580 --> 03:25:49.620]  kill biological populations. And so worms are eating those soil food web organisms.
[03:25:49.620 --> 03:25:54.660]  And if you put something into the soil that hurts them, well, there's that whole,
[03:25:55.380 --> 03:26:00.580]  an abundance of that primordial stew for the worms to eat on. So there are some older texts
[03:26:00.580 --> 03:26:04.900]  prior to the avocado tech that I think are extremely detrimental to soil organisms that
[03:26:04.900 --> 03:26:09.060]  do increase worm populations. And that is hard for people to wrap their mind around.
[03:26:09.300 --> 03:26:14.660]  But that's why I think the avocado tech's catching on so much better is because it's a way that you
[03:26:14.660 --> 03:26:17.460]  can increase populations without killing things off.
[03:26:17.460 --> 03:26:22.180]  Well, can you give an example or two of something that would make the worm population explode,
[03:26:22.180 --> 03:26:24.660]  but the microbial population collapse?
[03:26:25.860 --> 03:26:27.460]  The most common one is the neem cake.
[03:26:27.460 --> 03:26:27.960]  Okay.
[03:26:29.700 --> 03:26:33.460]  It'll definitely increase worm populations, but it's because you've killed everything.
[03:26:33.460 --> 03:26:34.500]  Got it. Okay.
[03:26:34.500 --> 03:26:35.540]  So it's just a...
[03:26:35.540 --> 03:26:40.260]  There's a question about tea and I've said it a couple times.
[03:26:40.260 --> 03:26:44.500]  Actually, here, well, yeah, go for the tea one, but this one flew by.
[03:26:45.460 --> 03:26:49.540]  Well, just quick on the tea, what we're seeing, you can go back earlier in the episode, but
[03:26:49.540 --> 03:26:54.580]  in the commercial space, it's really problematic to teach people tea. It's extremely volatile.
[03:26:55.140 --> 03:27:01.460]  And there's almost no tea brewing equipment that will help you do that.
[03:27:01.860 --> 03:27:08.100]  There's almost no tea brewing equipment that will actually achieve what Dr. Lane is talking about.
[03:27:09.460 --> 03:27:10.660]  You can put that one back up there.
[03:27:13.860 --> 03:27:16.180]  Now I just have no idea where it went.
[03:27:16.180 --> 03:27:18.340]  Someone's asking, how do you get fungi in your soil?
[03:27:18.340 --> 03:27:19.780]  That's through inoculation.
[03:27:19.780 --> 03:27:23.780]  So if you go back to the slide of the bad compost, there's no fungi in it.
[03:27:23.780 --> 03:27:27.780]  So you can't inoculate with something that doesn't contain what you're trying to inoculate.
[03:27:28.260 --> 03:27:31.940]  So you really need to get in contact with the few people that are producing
[03:27:31.940 --> 03:27:33.700]  biologically complete compost.
[03:27:33.700 --> 03:27:42.420]  And so we sell it on our website, CresciveGrowers.org, C-R-E-S-C-I-V-E, you know, growers.org.
[03:27:43.380 --> 03:27:45.540]  You can also contact Catalyst Bio Amendments.
[03:27:45.540 --> 03:27:46.580]  They're doing a pretty good job.
[03:27:47.940 --> 03:27:51.540]  And there's a couple of Soul Food Web graduates that are making small piles.
[03:27:52.420 --> 03:27:58.660]  But aside from that, the people that are making compost aren't using biological assessment in
[03:27:58.660 --> 03:27:59.540]  their process.
[03:27:59.540 --> 03:28:05.780]  And so how can you improve biological outcome of something you're not measuring or quantifying?
[03:28:05.780 --> 03:28:11.940]  And their goal, most compost producers' goal, is not to produce biologically complete compost.
[03:28:11.940 --> 03:28:13.540]  It's to reduce waste streams.
[03:28:15.700 --> 03:28:16.200]  So.
[03:28:16.740 --> 03:28:17.780]  Okay, I found the...
[03:28:17.860 --> 03:28:18.660]  So enzymes.
[03:28:18.660 --> 03:28:20.980]  So I can tell you what I do know about enzymes.
[03:28:20.980 --> 03:28:23.380]  So enzymes are like little wrenches.
[03:28:23.380 --> 03:28:27.700]  So like John Kemp uses the example of putting together a greenhouse.
[03:28:27.700 --> 03:28:33.700]  You know, if you have a 9-16 wrench, you can use it over and over and over again on a 3-8
[03:28:33.700 --> 03:28:34.200]  bolt.
[03:28:36.180 --> 03:28:39.700]  And so enzymes work like a wrench that can be used over and over.
[03:28:39.700 --> 03:28:41.300]  They're also the catalyst.
[03:28:41.300 --> 03:28:44.020]  But then on the other side, if you think of something like citric acid,
[03:28:44.020 --> 03:28:50.980]  or a ResCleaner, or ClearX, or Dr. Zymes, or Big Time Exterminator, those are citric acid,
[03:28:50.980 --> 03:28:52.020]  which is an enzyme.
[03:28:52.660 --> 03:28:58.180]  But that is one of the most antimicrobial compounds we've ever used.
[03:28:58.900 --> 03:29:05.620]  And we actually use various enzyme products for the purpose of sterilizing the soil without
[03:29:06.180 --> 03:29:07.220]  doing too much detriment.
[03:29:08.180 --> 03:29:14.740]  So soil biology gets too far out of whack, we can wipe the slate clean, so to speak,
[03:29:15.300 --> 03:29:20.820]  with an enzyme product without turning things very anaerobic, and then re-inoculate, and then
[03:29:20.820 --> 03:29:23.700]  we can make rapid changes to a soil that have gotten off the rails.
[03:29:25.300 --> 03:29:26.900]  So, yeah, I think that's it.
[03:29:26.900 --> 03:29:28.100]  I think that's all I have to say.
[03:29:28.100 --> 03:29:29.780]  I'm going to go ahead and close the webinar.
[03:29:29.780 --> 03:29:31.700]  And I'm going to go ahead and close the webinar.
[03:29:31.700 --> 03:29:32.980]  And I'm going to close the webinar.
[03:29:32.980 --> 03:29:33.940]  And I'm going to close the webinar.
[03:29:33.940 --> 03:29:34.980]  And I'm going to close the webinar.
[03:29:34.980 --> 03:29:35.940]  And I'm going to close the webinar.
[03:29:35.940 --> 03:29:43.540]  And I'm going to close the webinar.
[03:29:43.540 --> 03:29:46.420]  Any organic amendments you've noticed to boost THC?
[03:29:47.380 --> 03:29:52.420]  Not specifically an amendment, because that's really hard to replicate, because the farms
[03:29:52.420 --> 03:29:55.220]  that we're working with are doing so many different things.
[03:29:55.220 --> 03:30:00.900]  Even within the farms that are within our client base, they're all doing slight variations of
[03:30:01.700 --> 03:30:03.620]  the core strategy, essentially.
[03:30:03.620 --> 03:30:08.420]  So it's very hard to say, this amendment caused this increase in THC.
[03:30:08.420 --> 03:30:12.820]  I can tell you that the hemp people that we work with are very concerned about nitrogen levels,
[03:30:12.820 --> 03:30:18.020]  because if you put too much nitrogen into a hemp plant, you'll pop hot, or, well, you'll
[03:30:18.020 --> 03:30:21.300]  produce more than that 0.3 THC in certain cultivars.
[03:30:21.300 --> 03:30:27.460]  So there must be a correlation between THC percentages and nitrogen.
[03:30:27.460 --> 03:30:34.820]  But in my personal experience, as somebody that has gone very, very in deep with biological
[03:30:34.820 --> 03:30:41.700]  assessment, by far the greatest effect I've seen on increasing potency, total cannabinoids,
[03:30:41.700 --> 03:30:48.660]  terpenes, THC, whatever you want, you get an all-level increase by increasing the soil
[03:30:48.660 --> 03:30:52.820]  organism populations and ratios like I showed on that first slide.
[03:30:52.820 --> 03:30:56.980]  And so we've worked with a handful of cultivators that were already doing well as far as potency
[03:30:56.980 --> 03:30:57.940]  is concerned.
[03:30:57.940 --> 03:31:04.020]  And as we start to increase them up the scale towards what we would determine as desirable,
[03:31:04.020 --> 03:31:07.860]  they always have an increase in yield and potency every single time.
[03:31:09.460 --> 03:31:12.260]  So lots of questions.
[03:31:12.260 --> 03:31:17.300]  Actually, this is interesting just because Brandon's big on Bokashi and obviously Alan.
[03:31:17.300 --> 03:31:19.780]  And so what are your thoughts on Bokashi?
[03:31:20.660 --> 03:31:22.740]  I think Bokashi is a great tool.
[03:31:22.740 --> 03:31:25.860]  You know, it's accessible.
[03:31:26.580 --> 03:31:30.340]  If you try to make thermal compost like Dr. Lane, it's a journey.
[03:31:31.220 --> 03:31:35.860]  But a lot of people can get the raw materials to make Bokashi and have success there for
[03:31:35.860 --> 03:31:38.100]  the goal of producing Bokashi.
[03:31:41.940 --> 03:31:49.860]  My personal obstacles with it is it's such a small slice of the overall goal that I feel
[03:31:49.860 --> 03:31:51.060]  is the actual goal.
[03:31:51.700 --> 03:31:54.180]  And so it's a great starting point.
[03:31:54.180 --> 03:31:56.900]  I think it's an important primary species.
[03:31:57.620 --> 03:32:03.700]  But I think if you're relying on Bokashi only, you're really missing out on a lot.
[03:32:03.700 --> 03:32:10.260]  You know, probably, you know, based on what we've seen with other farms that were very
[03:32:10.260 --> 03:32:14.580]  bacterial dominant, missing a lot of the soil food web organisms.
[03:32:14.580 --> 03:32:20.820]  So not necessarily saying a Bokashi situation, but more importantly, mostly bacteria and
[03:32:20.820 --> 03:32:23.220]  very low or non-existent everything else.
[03:32:24.180 --> 03:32:29.620]  If you increase that fungal population, you get nutrient cycling up with protozoan amino
[03:32:29.620 --> 03:32:30.260]  nematodes.
[03:32:30.980 --> 03:32:35.540]  You know, there's been several situations where we've seen 20 to 40 percent increase
[03:32:35.540 --> 03:32:38.260]  in total cannabinoids of people that were already doing well.
[03:32:39.540 --> 03:32:41.540]  And we've replicated that on multiple farms.
[03:32:43.780 --> 03:32:49.300]  So this is and actually, again, getting back to my home grow, we have lots of eggshells.
[03:32:49.300 --> 03:32:56.340]  And are you into like water soluble calcium, like with vinegar and things like that or
[03:32:57.220 --> 03:32:57.860]  not so much?
[03:32:59.140 --> 03:33:00.500]  Well, it just.
[03:33:03.300 --> 03:33:04.980]  Eggshells bring up the question of.
[03:33:06.500 --> 03:33:10.740]  What produced those eggshells, what were they fed, did they have the potential to produce
[03:33:10.740 --> 03:33:11.300]  calcium?
[03:33:11.300 --> 03:33:17.060]  So, you know, I'm one of the few people that's actually doing analysis of different K&F
[03:33:17.060 --> 03:33:18.020]  products.
[03:33:18.020 --> 03:33:22.020]  Nick Tomasini is another person that's doing actual nutrient analysis, K&F products.
[03:33:22.740 --> 03:33:28.900]  And, you know, there was just one done where they compared the water soluble calcium and
[03:33:28.900 --> 03:33:35.860]  there was there was more calcium in the organics alive and it was the water soluble calcium.
[03:33:35.860 --> 03:33:44.820]  And so we need to we need to have more a broader mindset into the things that we're saying.
[03:33:44.820 --> 03:33:49.780]  So we can't have a water soluble calcium through eggshells unless there's calcium in
[03:33:49.780 --> 03:33:51.700]  the eggshells to become water soluble.
[03:33:52.260 --> 03:33:54.900]  So that's where organics really gets complicated.
[03:33:54.900 --> 03:33:56.580]  It's extremely varied.
[03:33:56.580 --> 03:34:00.900]  You would be mind blown at the output and variation in different and different products.
[03:34:00.900 --> 03:34:06.340]  So, you know, for example, like something like feather meal, I've added feather meal to a
[03:34:06.340 --> 03:34:11.860]  soil at twice the rate I have before and gotten half the nitrogen out of it.
[03:34:12.580 --> 03:34:18.660]  And so there's just because the bag says, you know, five, five, five or whatever, it
[03:34:18.660 --> 03:34:21.300]  doesn't necessarily mean that that product has.
[03:34:23.140 --> 03:34:23.460]  You know.
[03:34:25.380 --> 03:34:27.620]  Even consistent levels of what's supposed to be in there.
[03:34:27.620 --> 03:34:34.340]  So we see that a lot with like even the aminos, we see variations in nitrogen concentration
[03:34:34.340 --> 03:34:36.020]  in that product from batch to batch.
[03:34:36.980 --> 03:34:40.980]  A lot of the other nutrients we see considerable variation from batch to batch.
[03:34:42.820 --> 03:34:48.180]  And so not to give you an overcomplicated answer all the time, but it is that complicated
[03:34:48.180 --> 03:34:53.300]  and we need to introduce these concepts into the consciousness so that we don't we don't
[03:34:53.300 --> 03:34:58.020]  think so statically like, well, I read a recipe for water soluble calcium.
[03:34:58.020 --> 03:34:59.140]  I followed it.
[03:34:59.140 --> 03:35:00.420]  I should have X.
[03:35:00.420 --> 03:35:02.260]  It's like, well, you might not.
[03:35:02.980 --> 03:35:04.660]  You know, you might not.
[03:35:04.660 --> 03:35:08.820]  So I think it's great people get into natural farming techniques.
[03:35:08.820 --> 03:35:10.180]  We just, you know.
[03:35:13.060 --> 03:35:13.940]  Need accountability.
[03:35:15.060 --> 03:35:17.220]  So nitrogen fixing cover crops.
[03:35:18.980 --> 03:35:21.060]  There's another one I'm kind of a poo poo on.
[03:35:24.740 --> 03:35:28.660]  Well, I like the comment ayahuasca is a companion plant.
[03:35:28.660 --> 03:35:29.460]  That's a good plant.
[03:35:32.660 --> 03:35:33.620]  Yeah, let's do that.
[03:35:33.620 --> 03:35:40.420]  So my objection and well, not my objection, my journey of nitrogen fixing cover crops is.
[03:35:41.220 --> 03:35:44.980]  When I first get into this, you hear about all the things from permaculture and things
[03:35:44.980 --> 03:35:46.100]  that we can incorporate.
[03:35:46.100 --> 03:35:50.260]  And then I've worked with farms that are trying to incorporate these things and then come
[03:35:50.260 --> 03:35:53.060]  to find out it's not really doing what we're doing.
[03:35:53.060 --> 03:35:57.380]  And that's where we need to really expand our mindset to encompass the entire.
[03:35:58.580 --> 03:36:01.140]  The entire spectrum of the things that we're talking about.
[03:36:01.140 --> 03:36:03.780]  So, for example, with nitrogen fixing cover crops.
[03:36:04.820 --> 03:36:09.620]  Just because you planted a nitrogen fixing cover crop doesn't mean there's nitrogen fixation
[03:36:09.620 --> 03:36:10.100]  happening.
[03:36:10.100 --> 03:36:12.420]  You need certain considerations for that.
[03:36:12.420 --> 03:36:18.740]  So, for example, if you're if you're growing a nitrogen fixing cover crop that forms nodules
[03:36:18.740 --> 03:36:22.740]  like clover, you should at some point pull that plant out and look at the roots.
[03:36:23.380 --> 03:36:25.300]  One, see if there's nodules formed.
[03:36:26.020 --> 03:36:29.780]  If there is nodules, cut them open with a razor blade and see if they're they look like
[03:36:29.780 --> 03:36:31.460]  a medium rare stake on the inside.
[03:36:31.460 --> 03:36:34.580]  They should be pink because you can form nodules.
[03:36:34.580 --> 03:36:40.660]  But if there's not enough iron or more specifically the heme molecule, which is similar to iron,
[03:36:43.220 --> 03:36:45.220]  there's not nitrogen fixation happening.
[03:36:45.860 --> 03:36:49.220]  So you have to plant a nitrogen fixing cover crop.
[03:36:49.220 --> 03:36:52.260]  You have to have the presence of nitrogen fixing bacteria.
[03:36:52.260 --> 03:36:54.740]  You have to have the presence of the heme molecule.
[03:36:54.740 --> 03:36:56.580]  Then you get nitrogen fixation.
[03:36:56.580 --> 03:37:01.780]  And so in my experience as a person that has quantified everybody in the industry down
[03:37:01.780 --> 03:37:07.300]  there, whether personally or through people that are following their instructions.
[03:37:08.980 --> 03:37:13.380]  You know, almost none of these people have actual nitrogen fixation in the clover.
[03:37:13.380 --> 03:37:19.940]  So then what you end up with is a cool season clover crop that's in with a warm season cannabis
[03:37:19.940 --> 03:37:20.580]  crop.
[03:37:20.580 --> 03:37:21.860]  The clover is unhappy.
[03:37:21.860 --> 03:37:25.060]  It's harvesting or it's harboring mites and thrips.
[03:37:25.780 --> 03:37:30.420]  Like I personally been trying to get people to get rid of clover since mid 2016 because
[03:37:30.420 --> 03:37:33.540]  we would go to a farm and they'd be like, how do we get rid of these thrips and spider
[03:37:33.540 --> 03:37:33.860]  mites?
[03:37:34.500 --> 03:37:36.260]  They're like, take out the clover cover crop.
[03:37:37.060 --> 03:37:38.020]  They don't want to hear that.
[03:37:38.660 --> 03:37:43.940]  And if you if you look at a facility very intently that's going from harvest to harvest
[03:37:43.940 --> 03:37:49.300]  and you're trying to navigate the regulated space, you will see that as you harvest your
[03:37:49.300 --> 03:37:53.380]  plant, all those thrips or mites go into the cover crop in the clover.
[03:37:53.380 --> 03:37:56.580]  And then they under overwinter or whatever they call it.
[03:37:56.580 --> 03:37:59.220]  And then when you replant again, they jump right into it.
[03:37:59.860 --> 03:38:02.100]  And so it just the clover.
[03:38:02.100 --> 03:38:05.140]  This is where I really start to get like my old man hat on.
[03:38:05.140 --> 03:38:11.700]  But like, you know, nobody's noticing that the shit's loaded with bugs.
[03:38:12.580 --> 03:38:17.300]  Like even if you scroll back in Instagram and you go through people's pictures and they're
[03:38:17.300 --> 03:38:20.820]  all raving about clover and you zoom in, there's all kinds of pockmarks on it.
[03:38:20.900 --> 03:38:21.300]  It's like.
[03:38:24.180 --> 03:38:26.660]  So when I talk to a guy, I can't think of his name right now.
[03:38:29.060 --> 03:38:31.940]  He was introduced to me by Eric with Stacking Functions.
[03:38:31.940 --> 03:38:36.740]  He's a permaculture cover crop guru.
[03:38:37.460 --> 03:38:41.220]  And I was talking to him about a year and a half ago, and we were talking about the
[03:38:41.220 --> 03:38:43.620]  concepts of clover and I'd already decided I didn't like it.
[03:38:43.620 --> 03:38:44.500]  And I told him that.
[03:38:44.500 --> 03:38:49.300]  And his only response was, why would you be putting a cool season plant with a warm season
[03:38:49.300 --> 03:38:49.540]  plant?
[03:38:50.820 --> 03:38:51.300]  And I'm like.
[03:38:52.500 --> 03:38:52.900]  Thank you.
[03:38:53.620 --> 03:38:53.860]  Like.
[03:38:55.060 --> 03:39:00.820]  We need to research more deeply the things that we repeat and reproduce over and over
[03:39:00.820 --> 03:39:01.060]  again.
[03:39:03.380 --> 03:39:04.340]  You know, so.
[03:39:07.060 --> 03:39:07.540]  I don't know.
[03:39:09.700 --> 03:39:10.660]  I don't know.
[03:39:10.660 --> 03:39:18.820]  We're three hours and 47 minutes into our soil, our soil deep dive.
[03:39:19.300 --> 03:39:23.780]  You want to call it a day and we'll come back again?
[03:39:24.980 --> 03:39:28.580]  Yeah, I mean, yeah, it's yeah, I think we did it.
[03:39:29.300 --> 03:39:31.780]  So there's a couple of questions about Dichondra.
[03:39:31.780 --> 03:39:32.980]  I love Dichondra.
[03:39:32.980 --> 03:39:38.020]  I feel pretty responsible for that being in the growing community.
[03:39:38.660 --> 03:39:43.140]  Sarah was working up at Dr. Lane's farm when they first built it and they were exploring
[03:39:43.140 --> 03:39:44.260]  cover crops.
[03:39:44.260 --> 03:39:46.420]  Dichondra was one of the ones that they tried out.
[03:39:46.420 --> 03:39:48.420]  We started putting it into our cannabis clients.
[03:39:49.460 --> 03:39:51.540]  It's my favorite, but it can get thick.
[03:39:51.540 --> 03:39:57.140]  If it does get too thick, then you can cause anaerobic conditions in the soil.
[03:39:57.700 --> 03:40:01.380]  But in my experience, it's been working well most places.
[03:40:01.940 --> 03:40:04.820]  Only been a couple of places where it felt like it wasn't.
[03:40:06.580 --> 03:40:07.700]  Wasn't the best.
[03:40:07.700 --> 03:40:12.100]  The one thing with Dichondra is it grows kind of like Bermuda grass once it's there, it's
[03:40:12.100 --> 03:40:12.340]  there.
[03:40:12.980 --> 03:40:14.900]  So make sure you want it before you put it in there.
[03:40:15.860 --> 03:40:16.900]  But I love it.
[03:40:16.900 --> 03:40:21.620]  If you only choose one cover crop, Dichondra will satisfy most of the check boxes that
[03:40:21.620 --> 03:40:23.060]  you're after with one seed.
[03:40:23.700 --> 03:40:28.340]  And so when we're trying to scale and expand and work through many facilities, Dichondra
[03:40:28.340 --> 03:40:29.140]  is an easy answer.
[03:40:29.780 --> 03:40:32.340]  It likes, it tolerates the high feeds.
[03:40:32.340 --> 03:40:34.180]  So you can cram feed in your plant.
[03:40:34.180 --> 03:40:36.820]  Clover does not like high strength feeds and gets buggy.
[03:40:38.660 --> 03:40:40.980]  You know, Dichondra, you plant it once, it stays there.
[03:40:40.980 --> 03:40:45.280]  Yeah, man.
[03:40:45.280 --> 03:40:46.480]  Looking at, uh.
[03:40:48.400 --> 03:40:48.880]  All right.
[03:40:50.640 --> 03:40:52.640]  I think that's a wrap.
[03:40:52.640 --> 03:40:54.480]  And I think that's all I got for the week too.
[03:40:57.440 --> 03:41:00.400]  I've been going since like 8.50 in the morning.
[03:41:02.160 --> 03:41:04.800]  I'm ready to go just chill the fuck out on the couch.
[03:41:05.360 --> 03:41:05.860]  Yeah.
[03:41:06.720 --> 03:41:07.600]  Me too.
[03:41:07.600 --> 03:41:08.800]  So yeah, man.
[03:41:08.800 --> 03:41:09.440]  Thanks again.
[03:41:09.440 --> 03:41:11.200]  I always appreciate you having me on here.
[03:41:11.920 --> 03:41:15.920]  You know, some of these mainstream people are afraid of me and I just appreciate that
[03:41:16.480 --> 03:41:17.920]  you know what I'm about.
[03:41:17.920 --> 03:41:19.280]  You've seen my work in person.
[03:41:19.280 --> 03:41:20.800]  You give me a shot to speak to people.
[03:41:22.800 --> 03:41:26.080]  If you wanted to speak all the time, I'd have you speak all the time.
[03:41:26.080 --> 03:41:33.600]  But I'm very cognizant that you come out of your turtle shell, you drop knowledge, you
[03:41:33.600 --> 03:41:36.160]  take wax on the head, you go back into your shell.
[03:41:37.120 --> 03:41:41.200]  And I just let you chill out until you're ready to come back out of the shell.
[03:41:41.760 --> 03:41:42.560]  I appreciate it.
[03:41:42.560 --> 03:41:47.120]  I think as we move further away from 2020, but in earlier years, it was just better if
[03:41:47.120 --> 03:41:53.120]  I didn't speak publicly because what I'm saying of the reality of the world is in stark contrast
[03:41:53.120 --> 03:41:55.600]  to what influencers are telling people to do.
[03:41:55.600 --> 03:42:00.240]  And so if I mentioned something, they feel threatened and attack me and talk trash and
[03:42:00.240 --> 03:42:00.960]  bump me on the head.
[03:42:01.600 --> 03:42:02.480]  We're getting out of that.
[03:42:02.480 --> 03:42:04.720]  People are getting smarter than the influencers.
[03:42:04.720 --> 03:42:06.960]  People are getting more educated than the influencers.
[03:42:06.960 --> 03:42:10.080]  They're more adaptive and open to these type of things.
[03:42:10.080 --> 03:42:14.720]  So like I said, I just thank you for the opportunity to have the platform and speak things that
[03:42:14.720 --> 03:42:20.720]  I think are important because if you haven't been paying attention, the entire planet is
[03:42:20.720 --> 03:42:21.680]  in a health crisis.
[03:42:22.240 --> 03:42:27.280]  And it's really time for us as a regenerative community to really get our act together,
[03:42:27.280 --> 03:42:33.920]  really come up with actionable strategies that lead to success, that lead to true regeneration,
[03:42:33.920 --> 03:42:38.320]  that allow farmers to stay in business and have success, that we can actually make an
[03:42:38.320 --> 03:42:40.960]  impact on the planet through whatever strategy.
[03:42:42.000 --> 03:42:44.480]  Brandon's strategy is different than mine, but he's doing it.
[03:42:45.200 --> 03:42:46.640]  I got respect for that.
[03:42:46.640 --> 03:42:48.000]  Sorry, I just hit the wrong.
[03:42:48.880 --> 03:42:53.040]  So basically, someone asked a while ago if you are consulting, I would assume the answer
[03:42:53.040 --> 03:42:53.520]  is yes.
[03:42:54.320 --> 03:42:54.960]  Yeah, for sure.
[03:42:56.320 --> 03:42:58.080]  And the name of your compost.
[03:42:58.080 --> 03:43:05.760]  So if you go, I think on Instagram, if you go here and then the website is what?
[03:43:06.880 --> 03:43:09.520]  The products are sold at CresciveGrowers.org.
[03:43:11.760 --> 03:43:15.600]  And then our main website and then our, yeah, that's the shop.
[03:43:15.600 --> 03:43:19.520]  And then our information is at CresciveSoil.org.
[03:43:21.760 --> 03:43:26.080]  And we do sell compost that kind of popped up.
[03:43:26.080 --> 03:43:27.680]  We don't have a name for the compost.
[03:43:27.840 --> 03:43:29.840]  We just sell it through our website.
[03:43:32.800 --> 03:43:34.960]  Yeah, so see you there.
[03:43:34.960 --> 03:43:35.280]  All right.
[03:43:36.160 --> 03:43:42.400]  Well, let us end on that on our Wednesday afternoon.
[03:43:42.960 --> 03:43:45.920]  And actually, let me just check one thing before I let you go.
[03:43:51.450 --> 03:43:55.210]  No one responded yet, but I was going to say we may have a...
[03:43:56.330 --> 03:43:56.570]  What?
[03:43:57.370 --> 03:43:58.410]  No, no, no, carry on.
[03:43:59.370 --> 03:44:01.370]  No, I was going to say there may be a...
[03:44:02.090 --> 03:44:08.890]  Because on Thursday night, I wanted to potentially do a hash show.
[03:44:11.610 --> 03:44:18.810]  And I wanted to get Ganja Gill and Steve Cantwell to come on because they just collaborated
[03:44:18.810 --> 03:44:19.290]  together.
[03:44:19.290 --> 03:44:21.610]  So but neither of them responded yet.
[03:44:21.610 --> 03:44:25.290]  So Scott's IG is...
[03:44:26.250 --> 03:44:27.370]  Yeah, I don't have one.
[03:44:27.370 --> 03:44:28.490]  I don't even put it on there.
[03:44:28.490 --> 03:44:28.890]  I haven't.
[03:44:28.890 --> 03:44:30.810]  Well, no, you guys have that.
[03:44:31.850 --> 03:44:36.090]  The wife's been on fire for the past couple hours on the IG.
[03:44:36.090 --> 03:44:37.290]  So give her...
[03:44:37.290 --> 03:44:39.290]  Is she like 10 feet away from you?
[03:44:39.930 --> 03:44:41.050]  No, she's in the other room.
[03:44:41.050 --> 03:44:42.250]  So it doesn't feedback weird.
[03:44:42.250 --> 03:44:48.410]  But yeah, I've found it's just better if I don't participate in social media.
[03:44:48.410 --> 03:44:50.730]  You let her be your filter?
[03:44:51.370 --> 03:44:52.170]  Well, and I just...
[03:44:52.730 --> 03:44:54.730]  I can only be authentic.
[03:44:55.050 --> 03:44:56.890]  I don't mean to be disrespectful.
[03:44:56.890 --> 03:45:04.010]  But if you're saying some clowny shit, I'm going to require you to come correct.
[03:45:04.010 --> 03:45:09.530]  Because you got to keep in mind, my job is working with the farmer after the popular
[03:45:09.530 --> 03:45:11.770]  trend has failed them and almost put them out of business.
[03:45:11.770 --> 03:45:12.890]  I got to bring them back out.
[03:45:13.690 --> 03:45:20.490]  And so you're perpetuating the same nonsense that you as an influencer know is problematic.
[03:45:22.090 --> 03:45:24.490]  I lack the impulse control to not say shit.
[03:45:25.690 --> 03:45:28.250]  All right.
[03:45:29.210 --> 03:45:30.410]  Well, hopefully...
[03:45:31.130 --> 03:45:38.490]  So what I always wanted to do when we first started doing the live shows was to basically
[03:45:40.250 --> 03:45:51.450]  get you with someone whose research you've read and are fascinated by just to have you
[03:45:51.450 --> 03:45:52.570]  interview them.
[03:45:52.570 --> 03:45:58.650]  And so if that's something you'd be down to do, I think that could be kind of cool.
[03:45:59.850 --> 03:46:06.730]  I mean, I've tried to get Dr. Elaine on a podcast to talk about the ecological monograph.
[03:46:06.730 --> 03:46:08.730]  She has some really interesting insight.
[03:46:08.730 --> 03:46:11.930]  I'm only able to translate so much like what I was talking about in the beginning.
[03:46:12.570 --> 03:46:15.610]  I mean, if you could ever get her on to that would be really cool.
[03:46:15.690 --> 03:46:23.610]  Well, but I mean, her aside, I mean, think of all the academic research you've consumed
[03:46:24.410 --> 03:46:27.530]  and just kind of like it's like that's pretty interesting.
[03:46:27.530 --> 03:46:33.930]  Like if you could pick that person's brain for an hour, that's kind of what I wanted to do,
[03:46:33.930 --> 03:46:37.130]  where you just get to pepper them with questions after.
[03:46:37.130 --> 03:46:40.010]  It's like I read your research and I got a bunch of questions.
[03:46:40.650 --> 03:46:42.730]  Yeah, I'll definitely think about that.
[03:46:42.730 --> 03:46:45.370]  Or maybe like I see Matthew Gates just put a comment.
[03:46:45.370 --> 03:46:48.010]  He's another research guy who doesn't necessarily.
[03:46:50.570 --> 03:46:54.410]  He might produce stuff, but he's another guy that's read a lot.
[03:46:56.650 --> 03:47:00.250]  So he's a he's a he's a smart dude.
[03:47:00.970 --> 03:47:02.810]  But yeah, I'll think on that and see if I can.
[03:47:03.850 --> 03:47:06.490]  Most of the people that I'd want to interview are deceased.
[03:47:07.450 --> 03:47:10.410]  You know, that's tough.
[03:47:10.410 --> 03:47:16.090]  But yeah, I mean, I feel like it's like we just need one.
[03:47:16.090 --> 03:47:18.330]  I mean, Brandon, a while ago, I mean, I.
[03:47:20.170 --> 03:47:21.210]  He had sent me.
[03:47:24.880 --> 03:47:29.280]  Yeah, Brandon, a while ago, had sent me like stuff, you know, and I'm looking like these
[03:47:29.280 --> 03:47:35.040]  are a bunch of Italian researchers, Giuseppe Cola, Lori Hoagland, Maurizio Ruzzi.
[03:47:35.920 --> 03:47:39.520]  And I was like, fuck it, I'll reach out to him and just be like, you want to come on
[03:47:39.520 --> 03:47:45.280]  and talk with a couple hundred people, you know, who are who are like interested?
[03:47:45.280 --> 03:47:49.600]  Because I think for the researchers, it's like what they're like people outside of my
[03:47:49.600 --> 03:47:55.920]  super small academic circle who like would appreciate what I spent five years of my life
[03:47:55.920 --> 03:47:58.320]  researching. And it's like, yeah, they want to hear from you.
[03:47:58.880 --> 03:47:59.380]  Yeah.
[03:48:00.480 --> 03:48:06.480]  And I think with you as like the translator to the rest of us, like so what he's saying
[03:48:06.480 --> 03:48:07.920]  in plain English is.
[03:48:08.880 --> 03:48:10.160]  Right. No, totally.
[03:48:10.160 --> 03:48:12.480]  That's what I like about Matthew Gates is.
[03:48:12.480 --> 03:48:17.600]  So I've said this on other episodes, but it's like it's important to use correct terminology
[03:48:17.600 --> 03:48:19.200]  so we can be accurate.
[03:48:19.200 --> 03:48:19.760]  You know?
[03:48:19.760 --> 03:48:20.320]  Yeah, there you go.
[03:48:20.320 --> 03:48:21.440]  That's Matthew Gates.
[03:48:21.440 --> 03:48:24.000]  He's the predator insect guy.
[03:48:24.000 --> 03:48:29.360]  I'm not sure what his technical title is, but he's incredibly smart.
[03:48:29.360 --> 03:48:35.120]  But, you know, he's very accurate with a scientific wording, which is very important because
[03:48:35.120 --> 03:48:38.880]  then we can be accurate in directing people and specific and understand that.
[03:48:39.680 --> 03:48:43.440]  I feel like my role is somewhere between that and the bro science.
[03:48:43.440 --> 03:48:48.960]  So I'm kind of in the middle where I'm like, sometimes I misuse or mispronounce words,
[03:48:48.960 --> 03:48:53.360]  but I can get a little bit closer to putting it on the ear of the bros.
[03:48:54.320 --> 03:48:56.000]  I speak in Jive.
[03:48:56.000 --> 03:48:57.040]  So I'd be kind of interesting.
[03:48:57.040 --> 03:48:57.520]  Me and him.
[03:48:57.520 --> 03:49:06.240]  If we're talking kind of in the like predators eating prey and making them the nutrients
[03:49:06.240 --> 03:49:14.720]  bioavailable like you guys eat the research and then poop out plain English available
[03:49:14.720 --> 03:49:16.560]  information for the rest of us.
[03:49:18.000 --> 03:49:20.640]  That's that's my best way of describing it.
[03:49:20.640 --> 03:49:29.600]  It's you digest it and then we're all waiting for the for the digested plain English
[03:49:30.640 --> 03:49:31.440]  translations.
[03:49:32.080 --> 03:49:37.520]  Well, in practical applications to keep in mind, my entire goal is practical success.
[03:49:37.520 --> 03:49:42.080]  And so there's things that I read or ideas that I had that I was thought was going to
[03:49:42.080 --> 03:49:42.880]  be great.
[03:49:42.880 --> 03:49:46.720]  You start trying to implement them into the cultivation space and there's some sort of
[03:49:46.720 --> 03:49:47.200]  problem.
[03:49:47.680 --> 03:49:53.280]  So if I am saying something, it's it's coming from replicated personal experience to where
[03:49:53.280 --> 03:49:53.760]  it's worth.
[03:49:53.760 --> 03:49:55.360]  You know, I think that's really important.
[03:49:56.080 --> 03:50:03.120]  Regenerative permaculture, organic community gets too far down the ideas rabbit hole.
[03:50:03.120 --> 03:50:05.840]  And we need we need to bring it back to what's functionally.
[03:50:07.760 --> 03:50:12.160]  Applicable and able to execute and then move towards more sustainable from there.
[03:50:12.160 --> 03:50:13.520]  That's my strategy.
[03:50:13.520 --> 03:50:18.800]  We've got to start at functional strategies for successful cultivation and slowly incorporate
[03:50:18.800 --> 03:50:21.040]  more and more sustainable aspects in.
[03:50:22.000 --> 03:50:22.400]  Right.
[03:50:22.400 --> 03:50:29.440]  And then I think next time, one thing we didn't touch on that you had mentioned was the fires,
[03:50:29.440 --> 03:50:31.600]  which obviously in California is relevant.
[03:50:31.600 --> 03:50:38.560]  So kind of what you've seen like it grows and kind of how to how to deal with it, I
[03:50:38.560 --> 03:50:38.800]  guess.
[03:50:40.000 --> 03:50:41.920]  So we can pick that up next time.
[03:50:42.640 --> 03:50:46.480]  Yeah, I think next time I could put together something from the nursery that you and I
[03:50:47.040 --> 03:50:48.160]  were both a part of.
[03:50:48.160 --> 03:50:50.320]  And it's just really interesting.
[03:50:50.320 --> 03:50:54.640]  And I, you know, that that was pretty profound research that we did.
[03:50:54.640 --> 03:50:57.360]  And I think we're just at the point where I can just share it.
[03:50:57.360 --> 03:50:59.440]  I was worried about protecting those ratios.
[03:50:59.440 --> 03:51:03.120]  And honestly, I think at this point, fires are going to be problematic and we need to
[03:51:03.120 --> 03:51:03.360]  aim.
[03:51:04.000 --> 03:51:06.320]  We need to give something people to aim for, I guess.
[03:51:06.320 --> 03:51:09.520]  I mean, yeah, I mean, I'm starting to tear up.
[03:51:09.680 --> 03:51:12.640]  Yeah, that was a sad story.
[03:51:15.440 --> 03:51:20.320]  I would love to get Matt on and just have you guys talk.
[03:51:21.120 --> 03:51:24.000]  Yeah, because that would be cool, because Matt, I guess for the people listening to
[03:51:24.000 --> 03:51:28.480]  this private conversation, I was a consultant with a nursery that Peter was affiliated with.
[03:51:29.280 --> 03:51:30.800]  One of the employees was named Matt.
[03:51:31.440 --> 03:51:36.160]  So that could be interesting to have, you know, Matt kind of comment on some of the
[03:51:36.160 --> 03:51:38.640]  practical applications that I wasn't there for.
[03:51:39.680 --> 03:51:46.800]  And I stayed a little bit longer after Matt and was there day to day for about five months,
[03:51:46.800 --> 03:51:47.120]  I think.
[03:51:47.920 --> 03:51:52.160]  But the context of the property is it was in Santa Barbara during the fires.
[03:51:52.720 --> 03:51:57.760]  The fires came, dropped ash on the leaves that caused the cascade of plant health problems.
[03:51:58.880 --> 03:52:04.080]  The mudslides impacted people from getting to the facility that contributed to another
[03:52:04.640 --> 03:52:05.920]  decline in plant health.
[03:52:05.920 --> 03:52:11.840]  And then my, you know, Sarah and I's job the entire time was quantifying this property,
[03:52:11.840 --> 03:52:17.440]  the plant health decline, and then preparing it for a multimillion dollar crop loss claim.
[03:52:17.440 --> 03:52:23.680]  So we were working directly with, you know, a major insurance provider on a major commercial
[03:52:23.680 --> 03:52:24.240]  facility.
[03:52:24.800 --> 03:52:25.440]  Really interesting.
[03:52:26.320 --> 03:52:30.400]  And it was a disaster.
[03:52:30.960 --> 03:52:36.320]  And then it got sad and it got weird like it always does.
[03:52:36.320 --> 03:52:41.280]  But still one of my, I mean, I'm still the most, I mean, of all the things that we've
[03:52:41.280 --> 03:52:46.960]  done, you know, that's probably the top five of things I've ever pulled off in the workplace.
[03:52:46.960 --> 03:52:48.800]  I'm pretty proud of what we did there.
[03:52:48.800 --> 03:52:49.600]  You know, we saved you.
[03:52:51.200 --> 03:52:56.000]  You know, one of the owners of that property was, you know, Michael Masterson Smith, who
[03:52:56.000 --> 03:53:01.360]  is, you know, the guy that did university research at UCLA in the 90s to determine what
[03:53:01.360 --> 03:53:04.000]  cannabinoids actually affect cannabis.
[03:53:04.000 --> 03:53:09.520]  And so here I am, a person who's, you know, in some aspects been disowned by family members
[03:53:09.520 --> 03:53:10.880]  for my involvement in cannabis.
[03:53:11.440 --> 03:53:16.240]  I've got two family members right now that are in end stage cancer and going to die soon.
[03:53:17.600 --> 03:53:19.440]  None of them will take cannabis.
[03:53:19.440 --> 03:53:20.400]  And it's crazy to me.
[03:53:20.400 --> 03:53:26.640]  It's like I've, you know, came out the trap and worked with, provided plant health assistance
[03:53:27.200 --> 03:53:30.160]  to the guy that did medical research on cannabis.
[03:53:30.160 --> 03:53:32.320]  I got two friends that are dying right now of cancer.
[03:53:32.320 --> 03:53:33.920]  You can't tell them to consume cannabis.
[03:53:34.640 --> 03:53:36.080]  It's like I know the ratios.
[03:53:36.080 --> 03:53:36.880]  I know the formula.
[03:53:36.880 --> 03:53:38.000]  I know the strategy.
[03:53:38.000 --> 03:53:38.960]  I know the plant.
[03:53:38.960 --> 03:53:39.680]  I know the guy.
[03:53:40.560 --> 03:53:43.760]  I could get I could get Michael on the phone and talk to these people.
[03:53:44.880 --> 03:53:46.160]  Yeah, no, Michael.
[03:53:46.160 --> 03:53:54.800]  So just for everyone watching, he basically, you know, did research on cancer stem cells.
[03:53:54.800 --> 03:53:56.400]  And it's a very binary thing.
[03:53:56.400 --> 03:54:00.880]  Like, you know, you test stuff to see like, does it kill it or doesn't it?
[03:54:00.880 --> 03:54:10.880]  And cannabis, you know, and he was using all synthetic, you know, like 40,000 compounds.
[03:54:10.880 --> 03:54:13.040]  Like you get these things, you know.
[03:54:13.200 --> 03:54:18.640]  From what I remember, he explained in a simplified fashion as they started with, you know, whatever,
[03:54:18.640 --> 03:54:21.600]  20,000, 40,000 compounds known to medicine.
[03:54:21.600 --> 03:54:23.920]  They start injecting them into cancer cells.
[03:54:24.480 --> 03:54:24.800]  Yeah.
[03:54:24.800 --> 03:54:29.360]  And it either neither increases them or decreases them or whatever.
[03:54:29.360 --> 03:54:32.640]  And so they whittled down those over years of research.
[03:54:33.200 --> 03:54:37.440]  I can't remember the exact numbers, but he said something like of the original 20,000,
[03:54:37.440 --> 03:54:41.600]  30,000, whatever, they got down to like 12 compounds that were in the original.
[03:54:41.600 --> 03:54:43.840]  Like 12 compounds that reduce cancer.
[03:54:44.480 --> 03:54:48.560]  But of those compounds, like some of them were too toxic for humans and they whittle
[03:54:48.560 --> 03:54:50.640]  it down, whittle it down, whittle it down.
[03:54:50.640 --> 03:54:56.800]  We ended up with like six cannabinoids and four compounds from medicine.
[03:54:56.800 --> 03:54:59.840]  And then those compounds are used as blockbusters.
[03:54:59.840 --> 03:55:04.720]  So the reason why you have a cancer cell in your body is because it's not been given the
[03:55:07.360 --> 03:55:10.480]  signal to remove itself from your body called apoptosis.
[03:55:11.040 --> 03:55:18.640]  And so science or medicine uses blockbusters that that kind of trigger that process.
[03:55:18.640 --> 03:55:22.560]  The problem with the blockbuster drugs for medicine is they kill humans.
[03:55:22.560 --> 03:55:24.560]  Even if they work, they kill humans.
[03:55:24.560 --> 03:55:32.800]  But THC and CBD cause that same process to take place without causing problem.
[03:55:33.680 --> 03:55:34.240]  Right.
[03:55:34.240 --> 03:55:39.680]  And his next step was basically moving from the synthetic cannabinoids to actual,
[03:55:39.680 --> 03:55:45.600]  you know, that that was his whole entry into like the plant itself was, you know, could
[03:55:45.600 --> 03:55:47.440]  that be even better?
[03:55:49.920 --> 03:55:55.280]  And then there was a whole, yeah, just there's a lot of stuff we want to talk about on air.
[03:55:55.280 --> 03:56:03.760]  But do know you average cannabis growers could absolutely cure cancer.
[03:56:03.760 --> 03:56:04.240]  Absolutely.
[03:56:05.120 --> 03:56:07.280]  Even early on, right, I didn't even know what I was doing.
[03:56:07.280 --> 03:56:08.960]  I've had some friends with skin cancer.
[03:56:09.040 --> 03:56:13.520]  I'd make up a little dab or something and the skin cancer would come right off.
[03:56:13.520 --> 03:56:15.680]  Like it's so easy if you have the right compounds.
[03:56:16.880 --> 03:56:20.720]  And at some point, maybe the collective consciousness will be a little bit more open to
[03:56:20.720 --> 03:56:20.880]  that.
[03:56:20.880 --> 03:56:22.560]  I think we're starting to hit that tipping point.
[03:56:23.280 --> 03:56:25.280]  But it's just so many people dying right now, man.
[03:56:27.840 --> 03:56:30.720]  All right, well, let's all go smoke some weed.
[03:56:30.720 --> 03:56:34.800]  And I got to do it outside because if I'm in the garage, it all gets into the house.
[03:56:34.800 --> 03:56:35.680]  And then I get yelled at.
[03:56:36.320 --> 03:56:36.560]  Yeah.
[03:56:37.200 --> 03:56:38.400]  Keep it at home.
[03:56:38.400 --> 03:56:42.560]  I'll check in with you soon and I appreciate it.
[03:56:43.520 --> 03:56:44.160]  Yeah, no problem.
[03:56:44.160 --> 03:56:44.960]  Thanks again.
[03:56:44.960 --> 03:56:47.280]  It was a rare Scott scan sighting.
[03:56:49.840 --> 03:56:50.080]  All right.
[03:56:51.200 --> 03:56:51.920]  See everyone.
[03:56:51.920 --> 03:56:53.680]  I'm going to kill the broadcast.
[03:56:53.680 --> 03:56:54.160]  Yeah.
[03:56:54.160 --> 03:56:56.160]  Later.
