[00:12.860 --> 00:21.320]  And welcome to Seed Collectors volume number six, a fun show where we show off
[00:21.320 --> 00:27.440]  some of the deepest collections in the industry. We talk about what they were
[00:27.440 --> 00:33.500]  packaged in, where'd you get them, and which ones you popped. So we've got some
[00:33.500 --> 00:38.960]  awesome guests with us again this evening. We've got first up the veteran
[00:38.960 --> 00:42.880]  of the show, we got Dave's Not There. How you doing? Locked and loaded in the
[00:42.880 --> 00:48.520]  bottom already. I am fantastic, thank you for having me again. Pleasure to fucking be here as usual.
[00:48.520 --> 00:57.020]  Hell yeah, we're the Bartles and James of the Seed Show. I read that
[00:57.020 --> 01:03.840]  somewhere once. Sounds good to me. Yeah, right? I know. To compliment everything this evening we've got
[01:03.840 --> 01:09.120]  somebody who is just fucking doesn't even need an introduction. You're one of
[01:09.120 --> 01:13.360]  the hardest working dudes that I see out there, man. You've got all kinds of just
[01:13.360 --> 01:18.800]  fucking rad game and your own shop. So how you doing, Masonic? Thanks for joining us.
[01:18.800 --> 01:25.120]  What's up, guys? Right here, thank you guys for having me on. Yeah, yeah, no, my
[01:25.120 --> 01:29.680]  pleasure, man. It's fun seeing, you know, a lot of what you do. I know so many
[01:29.760 --> 01:36.320]  people who have been jazzed and benefited from your free seed days at your shop. That's huge. I
[01:36.320 --> 01:40.960]  don't know, maybe can we actually maybe start the show and just tell people what the free seed day
[01:40.960 --> 01:47.520]  has been all about and kind of the response you've gotten? No doubt. So free seed day started in
[01:47.520 --> 01:52.400]  September when they did a free seed day for comic book day. They had pushed it back to September
[01:52.400 --> 01:58.320]  because of COVID. Usually free comic book day is the second Saturday of May or something like that,
[01:58.320 --> 02:02.000]  but COVID kind of messed everything up and people wanted to get back in motion and they just
[02:02.000 --> 02:07.520]  started, you know, moving dates to say the least. So I was at my shop on free comic book day in
[02:07.520 --> 02:12.240]  September and I'm like, man, like I'm not at free comic book day. That sucks. But, you know,
[02:12.240 --> 02:16.320]  it would be cooler than free comic book day would be a free seed day. So right then and there, I
[02:16.320 --> 02:21.120]  just started, you know, I just followed up on that thought and reached out to all my peers and put
[02:21.120 --> 02:26.000]  the bat signal out. And next thing you know, a bunch of breeders and seed makers and pollen
[02:26.000 --> 02:30.640]  chuggers and hobbyists and whatever you want to call it. They all reached out and they all sent
[02:30.640 --> 02:36.800]  their, you know, their load and I distributed it amongst, you know, X amount of bags and I gave
[02:36.800 --> 02:42.480]  them away for free at my storefront in Los Angeles. That's freaking badass. So, you know, I saw some of
[02:42.480 --> 02:47.920]  the, you know, the footage of, you know, people in the line, all kinds of people all in a good mood
[02:47.920 --> 02:51.840]  enjoying themselves. And I'm like, man, if I was in the area, there's like two things I would line
[02:51.840 --> 02:58.000]  up for like the Star Wars movie and Masonic's free seed day. So those are both pretty badass.
[02:58.720 --> 03:02.080]  Yeah. I don't know, David, have you ever seen anything like that? I've never seen anything like
[03:02.080 --> 03:06.080]  that. I personally, yeah, no, I personally haven't seen anything like that. Not only does he do that,
[03:06.080 --> 03:12.880]  I've seen him donate a bunch of seeds out there to benefit other people, people in need. He's
[03:12.880 --> 03:20.080]  definitely a classy guy. Classy guy. But I'm still claiming the hair title, bro. Like the hair title
[03:20.080 --> 03:28.320]  is mine. No doubt, man. You can have it, plant. Well, you know, let's get started. I thought we'd
[03:28.320 --> 03:33.520]  kind of have, you know, fun tonight since everybody's got, you know, their collections
[03:33.520 --> 03:37.440]  and some fun things to pull out. We'll probably go with like, all right, who's got something blue?
[03:37.440 --> 03:42.320]  And we'll riff off that or, you know, chat, throw in your suggestions. I kind of want to start with
[03:42.320 --> 03:48.240]  maybe, you know, like what are you guys keeping them in? I've kind of got like here for myself,
[03:48.240 --> 03:54.160]  I've got two things. I've got one. This is like a, it's a tackle box, but it's waterproof. So it's
[03:54.160 --> 04:01.680]  got really good O-rings on it. And I've got obviously my desiccant packs in it, but really
[04:01.680 --> 04:08.080]  thick, nice O-ring keeps everything decent in there. And then I also have, that was 25 bucks
[04:08.080 --> 04:11.920]  on Amazon. I went for like a cheaper one because it, you know, it's supposed to have like the clamp
[04:11.920 --> 04:18.000]  down and the O-ring in the inside to make it seal. This was like a 10 bucker. Didn't seal as tight.
[04:18.560 --> 04:25.040]  Should probably use my desiccant packs after tonight, but yeah, just got some randos in here,
[04:25.040 --> 04:29.600]  but that's what I'm keeping them in. I'm not doing the fridge or the freezer or anything like that.
[04:29.600 --> 04:37.520]  I just try to keep them in a cool dark place. How about you, man? What are you rolling tonight?
[04:38.400 --> 04:39.840]  Big, hefty trash bag?
[04:40.720 --> 04:48.480]  So yeah, there's actually trash bags. So let me take you down. I just cleaned up this little
[04:48.480 --> 04:53.760]  slurper right here. So I got this camera, so it's perfect. I could just pick it up instead of a big
[04:53.760 --> 05:02.480]  ass fucking laptop lugging around. So check it out. This is where I first started storing my
[05:02.480 --> 05:07.760]  seeds. Like when I first started growing. So these are like, you know, these are my first seeds that
[05:07.760 --> 05:22.800]  I ever got. As promised, as promised. The internet's ablaze. It's so rebel. I recognize that
[05:22.800 --> 05:30.240]  one from the Daga site. I don't know where I'd be without my first seeds I ever got. So I'm just
[05:30.320 --> 05:38.560]  kidding. We'll get that out the way. This is actually my first seeds that I started collecting
[05:38.560 --> 05:44.160]  right here and just kind of put into the side. So, you know, I started in like sandwich bags
[05:44.160 --> 05:50.560]  and I'd grow something and I'd keep a nug around. I wouldn't want to shuck it. I'd get gifted stuff.
[05:50.560 --> 05:55.680]  You know, oh man, that got my heart racing. I haven't trolled that hard in a while. I'm so sorry.
[05:55.680 --> 06:00.880]  I'm sorry. Half the people are like, what, what, what?
[06:03.120 --> 06:07.760]  So this is like where I first started storing my weed. This is really, really like half a decade
[06:07.760 --> 06:15.120]  old type shit. Are they like bag seeds that you pulled out or just- Bag seeds from a clone that
[06:15.120 --> 06:20.160]  someone gave me, you know, maybe a real cross here and there. Like here's a cherry sherb F1.
[06:21.200 --> 06:25.440]  You know, somebody gave me some cherry sherb. I grew those out and these are the bag seeds from
[06:25.440 --> 06:30.080]  that. You know, when just, these are like some of the first things I ever started with. And then
[06:30.080 --> 06:34.880]  like, you know, we just started going kind of crazy. You know, I made my first cross ever.
[06:35.840 --> 06:42.880]  One of the first crosses, this is Wilson before I got, before I worked with Oni. This is Wilson,
[06:42.880 --> 06:49.760]  you know. Right. My Rye Wilson right here. So that kind of happened. And then that allowed me to get
[06:49.760 --> 06:54.880]  like, you know, just go down the ringer of just, I try to organize them one time, right?
[06:54.880 --> 06:56.240]  It didn't really work.
[06:56.240 --> 06:59.840]  Do you go alphabetical or how'd you try to do that?
[06:59.840 --> 07:06.080]  Oh yeah. I had to just stop, you know, like it was getting crazy.
[07:07.520 --> 07:16.000]  Wow. Good lord, man. I hope you don't live in a flood zone cause that would be fucking horrible.
[07:16.000 --> 07:18.320]  I don't live in a flood zone.
[07:19.040 --> 07:21.360]  That's good. What the fuck?
[07:21.360 --> 07:26.320]  So like, it's just like, and this is just part of my collection. I couldn't bring it all out,
[07:27.120 --> 07:30.640]  but like, you know, I'm heavily invested in my seed stock, you know.
[07:30.640 --> 07:33.040]  I just kind of...
[07:33.040 --> 07:36.000]  You are. All right. So what is...
[07:36.000 --> 07:41.600]  So this is where I store them. I store them in comic book boxes. I got this fancy box right here.
[07:41.680 --> 07:48.240]  I got some postal service, these Dollar Tree deals, big totes, trash bags.
[07:52.080 --> 07:54.720]  Look at all these totes. Jesus Christ.
[07:54.720 --> 08:00.640]  Oh wow. Yeah. Now are a lot of them the same strain or do you get a good variety with those?
[08:01.520 --> 08:05.920]  I get like just one of everything, two of everything, three of everything. It all
[08:05.920 --> 08:10.320]  depends on who it is and what it is, you know. Like when recently Archive did his
[08:10.960 --> 08:15.360]  expedition line, right. And they were like $40 a pack. So I went ahead and grabbed like
[08:15.920 --> 08:20.160]  five packs of each of every pack that he released, you know, and just things like that.
[08:20.800 --> 08:26.240]  Yeah. Shout out to the team for, you know, doing things like that. But, you know, me personally,
[08:26.240 --> 08:33.280]  I like to invest in like the crazy ones, the dick swinging auctions. I kind of step into them and
[08:33.280 --> 08:37.680]  I'll go in there and they'll be like, oh, you really need this? And I'll be like, I guess I do.
[08:37.760 --> 08:43.520]  And next thing you know, I'm at a bidding war with whomever, wherever, and I'm getting a Congolese
[08:43.520 --> 08:51.600]  for 2000 or a BLR for 1400 or a fucking Pluto's cock, the strain I've ever even heard of for two
[08:51.600 --> 08:57.840]  bands they got me for is just not that they got me, but like it's all for the love of the plant.
[08:57.840 --> 09:04.480]  And I'm just, it's just, I'm investing right back into it. And I'm not even like banking on it to
[09:04.480 --> 09:08.400]  say the least. It's just another thing to me. It's just another tool, another tool. Oh, let's
[09:08.400 --> 09:14.480]  see what this does. Let's see if it's good subjectively to me. So it's just like, that's what
[09:14.480 --> 09:19.600]  the seed hunt's all about. And that's nice. Like you could store your seeds all you want, but,
[09:19.600 --> 09:23.760]  you know, it's best to store them in a living library and get them out and put them out into
[09:23.760 --> 09:29.680]  the network. You know what I mean? Yes. Amen to that, man. And you're absolutely right. I'd rather
[09:29.680 --> 09:34.560]  have the, you know, instead of the 16 box of Crayolas, I want the fat one with the sharpener
[09:34.560 --> 09:40.800]  on the back, you know, you got more colors to work with there. So that's why I skim through a lot of
[09:40.800 --> 09:46.160]  seeds. Like, you know, I'll pop 600 seeds at once and then I'll just grow them out. I'll try to share
[09:46.160 --> 09:50.880]  as many snips as possible and, you know, keep a male around. And if somebody wants to work with
[09:50.880 --> 09:55.360]  the male, I'll keep it as long as I can. So it's just annoying. And then I'll be like, all right,
[09:55.680 --> 10:00.000]  nobody, you know, I put you up for grabs like 10 times. Nobody wanted to breed with you, my friend.
[10:00.000 --> 10:04.640]  And you know, there goes, you know, a potential peanut butter bread cross. There goes a potential
[10:04.640 --> 10:09.920]  blissful wizard cross. There goes a potential Afghan, you know, hybrid, you know, all these
[10:09.920 --> 10:15.600]  strains that I've skimmed through and kept around just to like, for the love of the plant, to say
[10:15.600 --> 10:21.200]  the least, you know. Damn, damn. How about you, Dave? What are you keeping your stuff in these
[10:21.200 --> 10:27.200]  days? Well, first off, I got to say, holy shit, man. That collection. Wow. Like, oh damn, you
[10:27.200 --> 10:34.320]  dwarf me like bar none, man. Wow. I'm similar to you, Chad. I've got a few of those airtight.
[10:34.320 --> 10:39.200]  It's actually a dog food container to seal your dog food in. It's a little bit beefier. Yeah. Yeah.
[10:39.200 --> 10:47.760]  A little bit bigger, but it's not quite the... Well, hey, we're looking at a can of peanuts.
[10:47.760 --> 10:51.200]  You see that collection he just showed up a couple minutes ago there. Holy shit.
[10:51.200 --> 10:55.840]  I saw that. I will say, I was the person to drive you to pay two grand for that Jupiter's cock.
[10:56.960 --> 11:03.760]  Jesus Christ. Well, if you want snips of everything, like I got you, man. I'm only one person. I'm not
[11:03.760 --> 11:08.880]  one to be like, hey, that was 2000. Like, nah, like, let's get this shit out into the network.
[11:08.880 --> 11:14.960]  Let's spread the love. But people don't even know what I have. I could tell them I got it for 2000.
[11:14.960 --> 11:19.120]  But at this point, they're not even... They're just like, man, every day it's a new thing with
[11:19.120 --> 11:23.680]  you. So I'm just like, whatever at this point. Not that it's whatever, but I know what I'm doing.
[11:23.680 --> 11:29.360]  But to everyone, it's like, dude, everything you do is like, you do it and you put it on there.
[11:29.360 --> 11:34.160]  Like it's a grand. Well, you know, I did pay two stacks for this motherfucker. Or, you know,
[11:34.160 --> 11:40.400]  this is BLRF1 or this is a sure breath Mel. And it's just like, you know, they don't get as hyped
[11:40.400 --> 11:46.320]  as I do. So just things like that. Well, yeah, and those things are rare. Those things will be
[11:46.320 --> 11:50.400]  appreciated later. I think a lot of people will find them. A lot of people are slow on the take.
[11:50.960 --> 11:57.120]  Two dudes knew what Pluto's cock is since I bought the fucking pack. Fucking Dave's not here.
[11:57.120 --> 12:02.320]  And that dude, what's his what's my homie's name on here? I've known him for a while. And I sound
[12:02.320 --> 12:06.800]  like such an asshole for saying he's my homie. But he's the homie with the freedom stray dog
[12:06.800 --> 12:12.160]  or something like that. He's a nice guy on here. Two currents grow or something like that is his
[12:12.160 --> 12:16.880]  name. Really nice dude. But he only you two have been like, damn, you got the Pluto's cock. And I'm
[12:16.880 --> 12:24.160]  like, yeah, I guess I do. Motherfuckers. Tell us about it. Was the cock all you hoped for?
[12:25.200 --> 12:26.720]  It's this big right now.
[12:26.880 --> 12:31.600]  It sounds like a winner. Sounds like a winner.
[12:33.760 --> 12:40.880]  Well, you know, I guess I guess let's let's kick it off maybe with probably the most recent thing.
[12:40.880 --> 12:46.000]  Something something new that you got. I got probably my my latest pickup came from the
[12:46.000 --> 12:51.840]  American one right here. These are actually on the Daga. But some some Amy, Amy aces,
[12:51.840 --> 12:59.760]  Amy aces is it's the proprietary chimes, the cheesequake. And I was kind of excited for this
[12:59.760 --> 13:04.400]  one. This one actually has been making its rounds for about over a year. I've seen a lot of guys in
[13:04.400 --> 13:10.640]  the UK that got their hands on this Canada, US, a lot of good grow reports from the American one.
[13:10.640 --> 13:16.560]  So these will probably be seeing some dirt sometime soon. So this was this was my latest
[13:16.560 --> 13:20.800]  pickup. Well, what'd you get? What's what's set your mailbox on fire lately, Dave?
[13:21.840 --> 13:27.040]  Oh, this this little guy right here, the tropical sleigh ride root beer. That's something I'm
[13:27.040 --> 13:33.840]  excited about that tropical sleigh ride was the 2017 Emerald Cup winner for unique terp beans,
[13:33.840 --> 13:39.040]  all other fanciness there. But supposedly it's got some of the best tropical turps out there.
[13:39.040 --> 13:44.480]  It would that I cut the root beer back cross to so hype on hype.
[13:44.480 --> 13:46.160]  And adding to the root beer collection.
[13:48.720 --> 13:52.320]  Who made that? Yeah, that's from Stoney.
[13:54.080 --> 14:00.240]  From Stoney farms and extracts. Cool, cool. That root beer is very elusive. And you know,
[14:01.200 --> 14:05.040]  it's like, I've, you know, it's just one of those strains that
[14:05.040 --> 14:12.160]  has that that whole, you know, mystique behind it. Oh, yeah. So I just NL five Coca Cola root beer.
[14:13.120 --> 14:18.000]  I'm growing those right now. I got those I have. Mine are probably like,
[14:19.600 --> 14:26.080]  like 10 feet bigger than Jupiter's cock. Yeah, those are those are big. The most recent strain
[14:26.080 --> 14:32.800]  that I acquired, like just the last one that was put in front of me was my buddy ranch gave me some
[14:32.800 --> 14:37.760]  stuff. So that was the most recent stuff that just kind of ended up in my lap. Let me see. I think
[14:37.760 --> 14:42.480]  it's right here. That's awesome. I was I was actually I was gonna holla the ranch because,
[14:42.480 --> 14:46.240]  you know, Dave, Dave likes the root beer. He's gonna bring it up. I'm like the one cross that
[14:46.240 --> 14:52.080]  I have. We got some burgers and beers from the ranch. That looks pretty fun.
[14:52.080 --> 14:57.680]  Land Afghani from the homie the ranch. He just gave me these and it's Hindu Kush region,
[14:57.680 --> 15:04.560]  blackleaf expression, land race heirloom open pollination. So you know, cool stuff. I'm totally
[15:04.560 --> 15:08.560]  into stuff like this, you know, and even more so because the homie made it. So, you know,
[15:08.560 --> 15:14.320]  even more reason to get down and dirty with it. But as far as strains that I've gone out my way
[15:14.320 --> 15:23.680]  to get recently, man, shit, shit. Let me think. Let me think. Like Rainbow Belts 3.0 just is like
[15:23.680 --> 15:27.680]  getting your call of duty just to be on point with your call of duties. You know, like you got to have
[15:27.680 --> 15:33.200]  the new call of duty. So I grabbed the Rainbow Belts 3.0. So that was between the what's the
[15:33.200 --> 15:39.840]  difference between 3.0 and 2.0 other than Instagram canceled it. I've only grown the regular
[15:39.840 --> 15:46.080]  Rainbow Belts and I've grown the 2.0. The original Rainbow Belts was a little bit more finicky. It
[15:46.080 --> 15:52.720]  just grew a little slower and those were fems. And then the 2.0 were regs and those were a little bit
[15:52.720 --> 15:58.000]  more voluptuous. You know, they just put on a little bit more weight. And as far as the 3.0,
[15:58.000 --> 16:01.440]  we're going to find out I'm actually going to be throwing those in the dirt like next couple of
[16:01.440 --> 16:08.000]  days. Nice. Now, what kind of, you know, like terapine profile or taste are you getting off of
[16:08.000 --> 16:13.680]  them? Because to be completely honest, like I've never grown runts myself. I've had runts here from
[16:13.680 --> 16:18.800]  Dispo's. I haven't known anybody like a good personal grower who grew it. So I've never tasted
[16:18.800 --> 16:24.000]  the frickin' rainbow. Like I don't understand the hype, but I also understand I've only tried it
[16:24.000 --> 16:30.080]  commercially. So it's like a creamy Skittles that you're tasting. So if you tasted Skittles before,
[16:30.080 --> 16:34.640]  that's probably the marker you want to base it off of. Because that's like the strain that
[16:34.640 --> 16:39.040]  isn't a vanity strain. It has like, it doesn't really have paperwork besides like gas station
[16:39.040 --> 16:44.240]  Bob and the Z dudes. But you know, all the Z dudes that brought it to fame. But all in all,
[16:44.240 --> 16:50.720]  it's like not as smoke and mirrors as the runts might be. So like Z is more of a better bar to
[16:50.720 --> 16:56.240]  allude it to. So like once you get privy to Z, whether it be OZK, whether it be Z cubed,
[16:56.240 --> 17:01.040]  whether it be rainbow belts, because it's a derivative of that Z terp. To me, it's like a
[17:01.040 --> 17:06.640]  creamy candy Z is the best way to describe it as opposed to Z by itself where it's more zesty,
[17:07.920 --> 17:13.680]  a little bit more sharp. That sounds good, man. I definitely, I go back and forth with my flavors.
[17:14.320 --> 17:20.560]  You know, I like everything. My favorite at the moment changes frequently, but I like things that
[17:20.560 --> 17:25.680]  kind of, they're undeniable. You don't have to make up. You're like, well, it kind of, you know,
[17:25.680 --> 17:29.280]  there's so many things out there today that just slappy in the face that you're like, yeah,
[17:29.280 --> 17:35.280]  that's a, that tastes like Skittles. No doubt. No doubt. Now, how about you, Dave? I don't know.
[17:35.280 --> 17:39.600]  Skittles isn't one of them. And that's another thing. That's another thing. I see what you're
[17:39.600 --> 17:44.880]  getting at there. Like when it says tastes like Skittles, I don't think they necessarily mean,
[17:44.880 --> 17:50.720]  and if they do mean the candy, like it doesn't taste like the candy. Like I eat the candy
[17:50.720 --> 17:55.600]  Skittles and that tastes like Skittles. I smoke the weed Skittles and it tastes like Skittles
[17:55.600 --> 18:01.760]  weed. Two different things. It's just the way of like, you know, pushing that envelope, you know,
[18:01.760 --> 18:08.000]  and, and, and it's not spelled verbatim Skittles, you know, like S K I T. No, it's, it's, it's,
[18:08.000 --> 18:13.120]  it's what a Z. So, you know, and, and why they call it that, I don't know. Like I would ask,
[18:13.120 --> 18:18.000]  you know, Brandon from third gen, I would ask Greener Fields. I would ask Tony Mendo. Those
[18:18.000 --> 18:22.480]  are the, like the three guys I could think of to ask why it's called Skittles. Oh, it tastes like
[18:22.480 --> 18:25.840]  the candy. Oh, well fuck to me. It doesn't. And that's, there's your answer, you know?
[18:28.400 --> 18:31.680]  Right. Maybe it's, maybe it smells like it to them during the growth.
[18:31.680 --> 18:36.720]  Yeah. Every, everything is so subjective. Like my, my sense of smelling smell, isn't that great. So
[18:36.720 --> 18:40.880]  when I actually do smell something or profile on it, I'm like, okay, damn, that's good. My wife,
[18:40.880 --> 18:46.080]  most of the time it's like, Ooh, that's a strong one. I don't know. Yeah. Okay. But that's why
[18:46.080 --> 18:50.400]  maybe I love the things that just kind of hit you in the face. If I, if I could smell it, I know it's
[18:50.400 --> 18:58.000]  really smelly, but, but Dave, you know, Skittles, the rainbow belts, ruts. That's not really
[18:58.000 --> 19:01.440]  something I've heard coming from your direction in the shows that we've done. Where, where,
[19:01.440 --> 19:05.920]  where are you standing on that one? Dude? I generally like to lean more towards the
[19:05.920 --> 19:10.560]  gassier stuff, but I don't have a problem with those strains, those candy strains there. They
[19:10.560 --> 19:15.680]  have their place. They're, they're, they're definitely great. He's trying to be PC about it.
[19:16.720 --> 19:23.760]  I love, I'm joking. Yeah, exactly. I would imagine. LA, we grew up on OG. Yeah. Yeah.
[19:23.760 --> 19:29.200]  We grew up on OG. That's like our first, you know, that's, that's the bar, that's the wheel,
[19:29.200 --> 19:35.760]  but you know, with, with, with the, with the lacks of legality and, you know, it being more,
[19:35.760 --> 19:42.240]  you know, available, you know, variety is a choice now. So, you know, we don't, we don't
[19:42.240 --> 19:46.480]  just need to, you know, I like some Zittles. Sometimes I'm tired of some Skittles. I go smoke
[19:46.480 --> 19:51.360]  some candy. Sometimes I just smoke what's around and that's usually the case. I just smoke the
[19:51.360 --> 19:56.560]  convenience, you know, like, damn, we got this big jar of, you know, great gas at the moment. So I'm
[19:56.560 --> 20:03.520]  just tacking at that great gas, like a mountain, just smoking as much as I can. So things like
[20:03.520 --> 20:12.000]  that, you know. Nice. Yeah. I see somebody in the chat had mentioned South Bay genetics. I've got
[20:12.000 --> 20:19.440]  some South Bay genetics here, actually. This is call. Let me see if I blow myself up. Cherry
[20:19.440 --> 20:28.800]  pines. There we go. It's a cross of cherry cobbler and a triangle Canyon. So I haven't popped into
[20:28.800 --> 20:36.160]  this one yet. I hear it has too many seeds to bring. So I had to, I cataloged a lot of them.
[20:36.160 --> 20:41.840]  I popped all of these from South Bay. I popped the wizard lips. I popped gas station, Bob. I
[20:41.840 --> 20:46.080]  popped the red toe Kush and I popped the Royal Skittles. This is just this seed pop that I did
[20:46.080 --> 20:54.000]  this season. You know, I saw a big wind tunnel today filled with fricking pots on pots on pots.
[20:54.320 --> 21:02.640]  You mentioned earlier 600 at a time. Damn. Do you, so we've talked about this before, but do you
[21:03.760 --> 21:07.280]  pop all 10? If you have a 10 pack, or do you hold like two packs?
[21:08.000 --> 21:13.200]  Nah, we'll pop one pack, two packs, three packs. You know, we'll pop as many as we can. We ain't
[21:13.200 --> 21:18.000]  trying to, we're trying to get rid of these bad boys, you know, we'll pop as many as like right
[21:18.000 --> 21:22.480]  here. I pop both of those. You know, we pop a whole pack of that whole pack of that, you know,
[21:22.480 --> 21:28.000]  pop as many honeybees as I could from those. I popped some bone yard, pop some sundown,
[21:28.000 --> 21:33.760]  some Oni, tons of aficionado, some skunk tech. Got these in an auction right here. These green
[21:33.760 --> 21:38.720]  team original milk bone, a Christian compound hooked me up with these. I got these directly
[21:38.720 --> 21:46.560]  from OG real Kush. Here's that Jupiter's cock right there, fool. This is a family show.
[21:47.360 --> 21:52.000]  I popped the Gosney from Kevin Jodri. I popped the Colombian black from
[21:53.040 --> 21:58.000]  gauge freaking, I get these seeds from Thailand. These were sent to me from Thailand.
[21:58.640 --> 22:04.560]  These are from India. And then, you know, just tons of, I popped tons of my shit.
[22:05.280 --> 22:10.960]  I popped all these from Nick pop, these green teams, more Nick stuff, more Nick stuff,
[22:10.960 --> 22:14.480]  more Nick stuff. I popped these from the homie flying line research. These are like
[22:15.760 --> 22:21.920]  Taz, Taz and knee and land races cross some other stuff. Top dog, more Nick, more aficionado,
[22:21.920 --> 22:27.760]  tons of seed junkie. The homie made some mean mug crosses, some cranberry skittles,
[22:28.480 --> 22:33.680]  some jungle boys, some honey banana hybrids, tons of Nick stuff, tons of cap stuff.
[22:34.800 --> 22:40.240]  The homie farming stone did some rainbow belt crosses, tons of honeybee. These are some award
[22:40.240 --> 22:47.600]  winners from ego clash that I pop some mean bug F2s obsolete gave me these at ego clash.
[22:49.360 --> 22:52.080]  You know, just it's nonstop. I'm gonna be here all day.
[22:54.080 --> 22:59.360]  That's fun though. That's fun. And it's nice to see that you had all your tags ready to go
[22:59.360 --> 23:05.760]  because dude doing that much has got to be hard. Are you finding a whole bunch of different phenos
[23:05.760 --> 23:13.920]  when you pop that 10 pack? Depends whose stuff I'm sorting through. And most of the time now,
[23:13.920 --> 23:19.920]  a lot of these guys are consistent. Like, like, it won't be like an F1 will be like, you know,
[23:19.920 --> 23:24.560]  just a little bit of this and that. Or, you know, there's not too many people doing F2s. So, you
[23:24.560 --> 23:28.320]  know, there goes there, there goes that, you know, there goes probably why not, you know,
[23:29.280 --> 23:34.400]  not that it's a bad thing. It just is. That's how I kind of look at it. So, you know, if you want to
[23:34.400 --> 23:39.520]  do F2s, cool. If you don't, don't, I don't just do whatever you want. I'm going to be there
[23:40.080 --> 23:45.360]  looking for the fire regardless. So that's kind of how, you know, that's how I get down.
[23:46.480 --> 23:51.360]  But not, not, not too much of variety. It's kind of like one seed pop will kind of be
[23:51.360 --> 23:55.600]  whether one way or the other, it's not like, damn, there's, there's too many phenos to choose
[23:55.600 --> 24:01.440]  from. Nah, it's like one way or the other. Well, yeah. When you're dealing with that many plants,
[24:01.760 --> 24:07.680]  you can't be conservative on them. You got to cull. And when you do it that many times with
[24:07.680 --> 24:12.240]  that much numbers, you probably pick up the signs you're looking for early. You know what you're not
[24:12.240 --> 24:17.120]  looking for and you can probably cull a little bit easier that way. So I don't, I'm not big on
[24:17.120 --> 24:23.600]  culling till they're like done growing, you know, like I'll clone everything. I'll let it all even
[24:23.600 --> 24:28.480]  like, yeah, there'll be some runs and it's like, yeah, I can't even clone the run. So I won't kill
[24:28.480 --> 24:32.080]  it. I'll just fucking throw it in the corner. Let it live. Like, I'm not going to be like, oh,
[24:32.080 --> 24:38.000]  fuck. Nah, just fucking find a corner for it. Let it live and just give it its water. Like,
[24:38.000 --> 24:41.680]  and, and yeah, the outliers will be the outliers, but I'm not going to just start
[24:41.680 --> 24:45.840]  killing shit, man. I already fucking did all this work. Nah, we're going to, we're going to just
[24:45.840 --> 24:50.400]  throw your ass in the corner and let you fucking rock over there. And you won't see the day you
[24:50.400 --> 24:55.200]  won't see, like, you know, you won't see anything. You'll never get, you know, given out. It'll just,
[24:55.200 --> 24:58.320]  it'll just get grown out and it'll be cute at the end of the harvest. That's it.
[24:59.040 --> 25:01.280]  Right. I got a hard time with that too.
[25:03.760 --> 25:07.760]  That's why I keep winding up with more tents. Like I can put a tent here.
[25:09.760 --> 25:14.320]  So what are you, we're talking earlier, Dave, you, you haven't quite popped much lately,
[25:14.320 --> 25:18.480]  but you were getting ready for doing another pop. What the, what's on the list?
[25:19.200 --> 25:23.120]  Oh, that is definitely got to be on the list right here. I got some of this
[25:23.120 --> 25:27.360]  dog Walker, the biz cut that root beer back cross to I'll be throwing in.
[25:28.240 --> 25:31.520]  Can't really see the wording on there, but that's, that is what she is.
[25:32.240 --> 25:37.840]  Where did you pick that one up from the same guy? Okay. Same package. Okay. I get it now.
[25:39.600 --> 25:49.430]  He also sent me some Hawaiian snow, Hawaiian sativa. Honestly, I've got like a shit ton of
[25:49.430 --> 25:57.430]  clones. I just got in yesterday too. Every time I have a plan, I start adding more things to the
[25:57.430 --> 26:05.670]  plan, changing the plan. I wish I could pop 600 seeds at a time. That would be great.
[26:06.710 --> 26:11.990]  It'd make my life a little bit easier. And yeah, well actually, no, I couldn't take care of that
[26:11.990 --> 26:19.510]  many plants. Fuck that. I'd try. I'd try. How often do I run into Hermes? Not as often as you
[26:19.510 --> 26:26.070]  think guys. There was like one or two, a couple of late ones. And, and you know, you got to keep
[26:26.070 --> 26:32.630]  in mind, like I'm not growing them, you know, I'm growing them like I grow them. And even amongst
[26:32.630 --> 26:38.870]  these, like, you know, whether they're sardined in a one gallon in the corner of a, you know,
[26:39.590 --> 26:44.630]  of space or, you know, grown in their own pot to get a nice expression in a three gallon,
[26:44.630 --> 26:50.310]  five gallon pot. And they get nice and big, like even amongst those stressed out conditions, like
[26:50.870 --> 26:58.550]  I'm not getting like, you know, early Hermage in week two, week three, every now and then I'll spot
[26:58.550 --> 27:05.430]  one here and there, or, you know, I can name them. Like that's how little amounts of Hermes are. And
[27:05.430 --> 27:10.950]  I'd rather not just to not cause any problems. Cause I'm not the Herm crusader. I'm just kind of,
[27:10.950 --> 27:15.910]  it just is. And it's, and it's, and it's strains that, and breeders that, you know, probably push
[27:15.910 --> 27:21.110]  the rhetoric that, you know, work the line, you know, and, and, Hey man, those are, you know,
[27:21.110 --> 27:25.190]  fucking what about this one? And, oh, you know, shit happens and I get it. But you know,
[27:27.670 --> 27:31.910]  The further we get down towards, you know, the various recombinations, there are going to be
[27:31.910 --> 27:37.510]  some faulty genetics in there that aren't always apparent through, you know, the first lines or
[27:37.510 --> 27:43.110]  whatever, you know, sometimes if you can pop 10, 20, you might not see it. But I also, you know,
[27:43.110 --> 27:51.670]  I do pop, you know, I have some ethos here. I had the temple runs and then the chem OG BX three
[27:53.110 --> 28:01.350]  from them. And sometimes you get them and you know what, that might be the one in 10,000.
[28:01.350 --> 28:10.470]  So I'm not super quick to pass judgment on those. Shit happens, but in an ideal world,
[28:10.470 --> 28:16.870]  you never have to deal with them. Yeah. I'm the fucking Herma venture. You guys are killing me.
[28:18.230 --> 28:22.950]  I'm not here defending Hermans. I'm just saying actual fact and what it is. And I'm not even
[28:22.950 --> 28:28.710]  speaking on my strains. I'm speaking on just the general, you know, my general opinion on,
[28:28.710 --> 28:35.030]  you know, strains and the rollout of them, you know. Yeah. That's kind of that. Somebody asked,
[28:35.030 --> 28:40.550]  I just, I'm looking at the live comments now too. No, it's good, man. Do it. We're all interactive,
[28:40.550 --> 28:45.590]  especially on this one. This one is as much, you know, listener driven. Like you guys tell us,
[28:45.590 --> 28:49.270]  give us something that you think we should try to pull out or, you know, don't,
[28:50.150 --> 28:58.470]  I should rephrase that. Tell us what you want. Jupiter's cock. I know. Yeah. It's a family show.
[28:58.790 --> 29:07.190]  Speaking of that one, I'll go with King Kong. This is actually one of my more favorite creative
[29:07.190 --> 29:12.310]  packaging. Maybe you guys can have like a creative packaging idea, but it's cool. It's like a little
[29:12.310 --> 29:19.590]  Buddha. You see it. The seeds are in there. Makes a cool little, cool little charm. But this was a
[29:19.590 --> 29:24.070]  big Buddha who is famous for the blue cheese, which was one of my favorites while I was in
[29:24.070 --> 29:33.990]  Amsterdam. But this is actually a cross gorilla glue times cheese times a widow reversed. So five,
[29:33.990 --> 29:41.830]  five fems in here. These will get popped as part of my cheese hunt. I've got, I'll have to dig them
[29:41.830 --> 29:47.910]  out. I've got six or seven different things that I'm looking for the cheese in. So maybe we could
[29:47.910 --> 29:53.670]  go, you know, like, does, you know, your favorite packaging or something that you might be hunting
[29:53.670 --> 29:59.670]  or looking for specifically like I'll branch off of the cheese subject. So I actually grew some
[29:59.670 --> 30:04.630]  Dynafem cheese, which was really nice. They were super vigorous and they had that old school cheese
[30:04.630 --> 30:11.750]  turf. I'm growing some UK cheese that I got from all-star clones. I got a blue cheese from a duck
[30:11.750 --> 30:16.790]  foot genetics or something. He's friends with a cannabis research co or something like that. When
[30:16.790 --> 30:23.990]  I met him back in San Francisco, like two years ago, and then I got a, I got a UK cheese guava
[30:23.990 --> 30:29.110]  cubed or something like that from obsolete. So those are the four cheeses that I'm rocking with
[30:29.110 --> 30:36.230]  right now. And I did keep my Dynafem cheese around. So I have the mom of that. I'm spreading that
[30:36.230 --> 30:42.070]  around. And of course, you know, I crossed it to Wilson. So I got a Dynafem cheese across to Wilson
[30:42.070 --> 30:47.590]  and I have blue cheese Wilson as well. And those are the cheeses that I'm rocking with right now.
[30:47.590 --> 30:53.910]  I did get to hang out with Dan from node labs and he let me see some of the cheeses that they're
[30:53.910 --> 31:00.310]  working on with, with that dude, actually that you just mentioned, I believe. And, and I got to
[31:00.310 --> 31:06.870]  actually test out Cali X's their brand out here in LA. They did a bunch of Skittles cheese crosses
[31:06.870 --> 31:11.910]  and I got to judge or like, you know, help them choose their keeper in that hunt. So yeah,
[31:12.470 --> 31:16.630]  I see a resurgence of cheese. That's cool that you got that going over there. You know,
[31:16.630 --> 31:21.270]  that's your privy right now. Yeah. Thanks man. So let's see here. I got just a
[31:21.830 --> 31:30.710]  kind of like a random blue cheese from your Spanish seed bank. Try the Royal queen.
[31:30.710 --> 31:38.550]  They got their blue cheese, got garden of green and Exodus cheese here. And of course, you know,
[31:38.550 --> 31:45.190]  greenhouse. I did just come back from Amsterdam too. So, so Jesus, Jesus are on the deal. And
[31:45.190 --> 31:52.390]  then my guy, Ty, he actually sent me some blue cheese. Let's see, this is getting popped that
[31:52.390 --> 32:01.940]  need to go in there. This was the blue cheese, blueberry time, old school cheese. So yeah,
[32:01.940 --> 32:06.020]  those are, those are kind of get popped. That's what I'm hunting, hunting there.
[32:06.580 --> 32:12.420]  Now that I'm looking in here, you had a bunch of tie stuff, Masonic. Have you ever heard of a
[32:12.420 --> 32:20.500]  tie skunk at all? I haven't heard of tie skunk. Okay. This is something sent, sent me a hundred
[32:20.500 --> 32:27.460]  of those. Not quite sure what the germ is on that, but that'll be fun to get into. I kind of shy away
[32:27.460 --> 32:33.780]  from some of the longer sativa strains cause I grow inside in a tent, but yeah.
[32:34.180 --> 32:38.820]  Yeah. You're taking one for the team doing that type of stuff over there, you know, just
[32:39.940 --> 32:43.780]  as a shock factor to your growth style when you're growing like that.
[32:47.460 --> 32:52.340]  I planted some, I read genetics. I don't know if you two guys have tried some of that stuff.
[32:55.540 --> 32:59.620]  From Colorado, shout out Irie. I see him at every color,
[33:00.260 --> 33:05.780]  the link up with him when I see him there and I say hi every time and I chime in on his lives and
[33:06.900 --> 33:11.860]  he's gifted me some packs and people have gifted me packs of his, but I like, I just keep,
[33:12.820 --> 33:16.420]  I keep dropping the ball and I'm throwing that in my lineup, but you know,
[33:16.420 --> 33:20.100]  eventually I'll get to it. Shout out Ross and Jeff, man. Good people for sure.
[33:21.060 --> 33:25.220]  Speaking of collections, he has a dope shoe collection. Shout out his shoe collection.
[33:25.780 --> 33:30.660]  Yeah. Shout out the shoe collection. We've definitely gone through the paces here. So
[33:30.660 --> 33:36.100]  let's see. I like collect skateboards. I've got, Dave, what else were you collecting last time we
[33:36.100 --> 33:41.940]  talked? I'm more of a collector of like older video games other than the siege that you see
[33:41.940 --> 33:48.660]  here, but that's the stuff we grew up with. The nostalgia that you have when you just,
[33:49.220 --> 33:53.140]  you're thinking about all the, how shitty things can be going sometimes. Like, you know what?
[33:53.140 --> 33:56.660]  Wasn't it great when I was 12 and the only thing that mattered was Sega Genesis.
[33:57.620 --> 34:02.420]  Yes. All the He-Man toys. You're probably a fan of the stranger things then. Yeah.
[34:03.060 --> 34:06.420]  I do enjoy that. Stranger things.
[34:08.180 --> 34:09.780]  Everybody tells me.
[34:09.780 --> 34:14.420]  I collect a bunch of crap too, man. I like video games, you know, I like,
[34:14.420 --> 34:20.420]  I collect vinyls, you know, and CDs and tapes, you know, I got an extensive vinyl collection,
[34:20.420 --> 34:27.380]  just like the seed collection, vinyl collection, my glass collection. I have a comic book collection,
[34:27.940 --> 34:35.540]  a Pokemon card collection. I collect chickens, you know, I'm like, I'm an extremist and things
[34:35.540 --> 34:40.420]  that I do. I can't have, I can't get into stuff. Cause then I'm like, I just got a freaking,
[34:41.300 --> 34:44.580]  you know, be, be crazy about it. You know, radical.
[34:45.300 --> 34:51.140]  I heard Joe Rogan once. He's like, I'm kind of, I kind of like I'm misguided because I'm really
[34:51.140 --> 34:55.620]  good at something and I give it 110%, but everything else kind of falls to the side.
[34:56.420 --> 35:01.620]  It's like tunnel vision, but you got, you got a variety of things going. So you got,
[35:01.620 --> 35:02.820]  you got multiple hallways.
[35:04.180 --> 35:11.220]  Yeah. Like I just bought a Hulk 181, the first appearance of Wolverine. Like that's like my
[35:11.220 --> 35:13.300]  most recent heady collection, you know?
[35:14.340 --> 35:20.340]  Okay. Going back. Do you, do you have a, do you got display cases or do you like, I've got,
[35:20.340 --> 35:24.500]  I mean, behind me on the tent, I've got, you know, I got my tech decks, my collector tech
[35:24.500 --> 35:27.860]  decks. They're just still in the packaging, hanging on the wall. So you can look at them,
[35:27.860 --> 35:28.660]  you know?
[35:28.660 --> 35:34.420]  Yeah, I do. I have a couple of nice display cases with like some of my, you know, I call them
[35:34.420 --> 35:39.220]  trophies, you know, like just cool things that I've acquired and got through the years, you know,
[35:39.220 --> 35:44.100]  like even like, I shouldn't, I use this as a daily driver, but I probably shouldn't like one
[35:44.100 --> 35:49.460]  of my motherships, you know, it's just, this could go in there, you know, just I've gotten very
[35:49.460 --> 35:54.820]  blessed with, with, with, with these cool little nice things that I collect now, you know, along
[35:54.820 --> 36:00.660]  with seeds and other things. And it's things that I like, you know, it is what it is.
[36:00.660 --> 36:04.180]  It's nice to be able to appreciate them. And like Dave said, you know, they do kind of
[36:04.180 --> 36:09.140]  give a sense of nostalgia. You know, I, I'm looking at so many things in front of me on my
[36:09.140 --> 36:15.940]  desk that yeah, it's totally, you know, I've got my, my, my little at, at that I made and yeah,
[36:15.940 --> 36:21.620]  you know, tech decks. So there's always, there's always something around to, to keep us young,
[36:21.620 --> 36:22.820]  right? Keep us young.
[36:22.820 --> 36:27.060]  I have a freaking Sandman toy right here, just chilling next to me.
[36:27.940 --> 36:28.260]  Nice.
[36:28.420 --> 36:34.500]  Just ridiculous. Yeah. That's one of my favorite, you know, comic book arcs, Sandman. So.
[36:36.740 --> 36:40.580]  So what else you got for us, Dave? What is the blue? I see all the blue.
[36:42.820 --> 36:44.580]  Gene's got some newer packaging.
[36:45.860 --> 36:50.500]  Damn. What crosses are those? I haven't seen that.
[36:51.220 --> 36:56.260]  You got the cherry AK-47, gelato 33 cherry limeade. It's a lot of the,
[36:56.260 --> 36:59.780]  a lot of that. Yes. Go. Oh, gee, lime at five.
[36:59.780 --> 37:04.340]  Wasn't the cherry limeade one of your, just like, I remember you had one pack from it.
[37:04.340 --> 37:06.260]  Okay. That was your like, absolute stuff.
[37:06.260 --> 37:12.820]  Anything, anything with that gelato 33 cherry limeade male. It just, it's gold. It gives it
[37:12.820 --> 37:19.060]  that gassiness. What if it's with the, with the runs, it took that kind of that, that runs flavor
[37:19.060 --> 37:25.140]  and put some, some lime gas on it. It was wonderful. So I'm actually very excited for that
[37:25.140 --> 37:30.740]  cherry AK to see if I can get some cherry with that line. Cause there was more lime,
[37:30.740 --> 37:35.220]  lime gas that came through with the, the G33 cherry limeade.
[37:36.420 --> 37:40.100]  But he's got the white with the gelato 33 cherry limeade.
[37:40.900 --> 37:45.060]  I like seeing the white getting tossed into a lot of things lately. It seems like, I don't know,
[37:45.060 --> 37:49.460]  for some reason, the last six months or something, I've seen a lot of that tossed in. I'm happy.
[37:50.580 --> 37:52.500]  Did that say burners something on it?
[37:53.060 --> 37:54.260]  Yeah. You didn't read that.
[37:54.260 --> 37:57.060]  I'm just going to call it out right now. I'm just calling it out, dude.
[37:58.100 --> 38:01.940]  Well, I'm over here. Burners, gelato, gelato.
[38:02.580 --> 38:07.540]  That's the thing. He got it as just burners gelato, but he believes it's the 41 after
[38:07.540 --> 38:12.820]  growing it outside by seven. That's why he's putting it as it was. You know what I'm saying?
[38:12.820 --> 38:16.340]  That's beautiful, man. Transparency is key, man. You got to love it.
[38:16.340 --> 38:16.980]  Absolutely.
[38:17.380 --> 38:25.700]  I got a string called burner's cookies, actually, too, from the modern epigenetics camp.
[38:25.700 --> 38:31.700]  I got it in the worst way, but, you know, shout out modern epigenetics and, you know,
[38:31.700 --> 38:35.060]  really good people right there. But I did get a burner's cookies and
[38:35.940 --> 38:39.940]  it is what it is, you know, it's burner's cookies. Shout out Big Burn.
[38:40.100 --> 38:47.060]  I got no comment, Dave. Save me. Save me.
[38:48.340 --> 38:51.060]  I got a Coca-Cola root beer mean mug.
[38:52.340 --> 38:52.660]  Nice.
[38:53.460 --> 38:54.580]  Some older Bodhi.
[38:57.060 --> 38:57.860]  Was that the...
[39:00.020 --> 39:06.260]  Yeah. Was that last one, the root beer mean mug, was that the Dutch blooms or was that mean gene?
[39:06.740 --> 39:11.220]  That is from Dutch blooms. He didn't put anything fancy on the back. He just hand wrote cocoa mug.
[39:11.860 --> 39:12.580]  Oh, yeah.
[39:12.580 --> 39:13.860]  Yeah. Totally Dutch blooms.
[39:14.580 --> 39:19.060]  That's awesome. That's stoked. And you're going to be up there this weekend at his farm, right?
[39:20.820 --> 39:26.100]  Yeah, I'm going to be at... I'm not sure if I'm going to be at his farm. I think I'm...
[39:26.900 --> 39:31.620]  It's at the mothership headquarters. I don't even... I'm just going to go in and I'm showing up.
[39:31.620 --> 39:35.860]  It's tomorrow. I'm not going tomorrow. I'm going Friday. Everyone's going to the spa tomorrow.
[39:36.500 --> 39:36.660]  Oh.
[39:37.460 --> 39:40.900]  I guess I fucked up. I'm going to miss out on all the fun.
[39:40.900 --> 39:45.300]  Hey, that's okay, man. I'm like twice as close to you and I'm not even going to be able to make it.
[39:45.300 --> 39:52.580]  So it's all good. I wish I could. I wish I could. The invite was there, but I got fucking adulting
[39:52.580 --> 39:57.540]  that I have to do, which is no fun. So I'll do that. I'll live vicariously through you guys.
[39:58.660 --> 40:03.700]  Yeah. Berner doesn't grow Jack. He grows cookies. Get it? Jack it.
[40:06.340 --> 40:09.700]  I love Berner jokes. So please guys, keep them coming all night long.
[40:11.700 --> 40:17.620]  You know what? Where'd that sound fit? Best Berner joke of the night judged by the three of us gets
[40:17.620 --> 40:22.340]  this pack of cherry pines. How about that? I'll send that out to you tomorrow. Best Berner joke.
[40:22.340 --> 40:25.700]  I'm bringing it on. No cancer jokes, guys. That's not funny though.
[40:26.420 --> 40:26.820]  You are...
[40:31.860 --> 40:37.380]  Yes, man. You're terrible, man. That's so bad. Please don't. Don't even go there. I didn't
[40:37.380 --> 40:40.820]  even know that was a thing. People are evil, man. I actually...
[40:42.980 --> 40:48.100]  I'll resend that. I'll give this away later for something else. I take it back. Okay.
[40:49.940 --> 40:51.140]  Leave Berner alone.
[40:52.100 --> 40:54.900]  Leave everybody alone, man.
[40:54.900 --> 41:02.660]  Right. Yeah. So what can you pull out and show us next, Berner? What...
[41:06.820 --> 41:08.340]  You got Berner on the brain?
[41:08.340 --> 41:10.900]  I got some cookies, man. Let me break them out.
[41:13.940 --> 41:15.780]  I got some cookies over here.
[41:16.580 --> 41:18.420]  You're killing it.
[41:18.420 --> 41:20.420]  I didn't even mean to do that.
[41:21.300 --> 41:22.180]  No, it's all good.
[41:22.900 --> 41:26.180]  So what's something within your reach there?
[41:26.900 --> 41:34.740]  All right. I'm going to grab a handful of Thug Pug packs. I have tons of Thug Pug.
[41:34.740 --> 41:37.380]  Because remember when Thug Pug dropped his Black album?
[41:38.500 --> 41:44.660]  No. See, I'm not that hip, man. I've never had money or good internet, so I don't know where
[41:44.660 --> 41:46.740]  to find these things until Dave shows me.
[41:47.540 --> 41:48.740]  So Berner... I mean...
[41:54.260 --> 41:57.060]  These are going out to you on Tuesday, bro. Coming to your way.
[41:58.340 --> 42:04.740]  Thug Pug dropped his Black album, and everyone went crazy and Badafau has stuck.
[42:06.660 --> 42:10.420]  So that's why I have a bunch of Jay-Z's Black albums.
[42:10.980 --> 42:16.500]  Nice. They are popular, man. He's got some real freaking fire.
[42:18.100 --> 42:25.060]  I'm happy. I'm not complaining. I tapped in when this was pennies on the dollar now.
[42:25.060 --> 42:29.540]  You know what I mean? I'm invested. I tapped in when they were like...
[42:32.020 --> 42:39.220]  WeWoo crashed at my booth in Colorado when there was an Indo Expo, and he let me get a bunch of
[42:39.220 --> 42:45.700]  packs on the strength, just to... Whatever, whatever. So I ended up with tons of peanut
[42:45.700 --> 42:51.220]  butter breath, tons of garlic breath, tons of just some of his namesake strains, some of his
[42:51.220 --> 42:57.300]  flagship strains. I've worked pop so many of them, gave out just as many, and I just...
[42:58.500 --> 43:00.260]  Just things like that. That's at arm's range.
[43:01.620 --> 43:04.260]  Reach. So that's what I grabbed right here for you guys.
[43:04.740 --> 43:10.980]  So if you put five of those in your hands, which ones are they and which one would you pop first
[43:10.980 --> 43:14.980]  if you had to? This is like the Christmas catalog as a kid. Okay, on this page, if I could have
[43:14.980 --> 43:19.700]  three things, what would I pick? So I grabbed five, right? I picked up
[43:19.700 --> 43:26.420]  Natural Gas, Putrid Michigan, Urinal Cake, and two Sure Breath packs. I would pop the Sure Breath.
[43:27.220 --> 43:33.780]  I would pop the Sure Breath. This one is really fucking good. I haven't heard too much.
[43:33.780 --> 43:38.420]  I grew the Urinal Cake. No, I didn't really care for it. The Putrid Michigan, I don't have too much
[43:38.420 --> 43:43.220]  feedback on it, as well as the Natural Gas. I would grow the Sure Breath just because I know
[43:43.220 --> 43:48.260]  what's coming out of it. I've grown this one before. I've had homies that have ran lines with
[43:48.260 --> 43:54.260]  it, and it's just a great way to stay in shape. Now, are you choosing that one maybe because
[43:54.260 --> 43:59.060]  it's like a great smoke or does it grow well and produce well? What's kind of the attraction on
[43:59.060 --> 44:05.700]  that one? Terps. Terps. I'm all about the terps. So that one, the smells off of it are fucking out
[44:05.700 --> 44:11.220]  of this world, and that translates into the taste. As far as the high goes, we'll figure it out as we
[44:11.220 --> 44:19.860]  go. But yeah, you have to taste good to even be around. I don't want to be living with something
[44:19.860 --> 44:26.020]  that doesn't taste good, even if it like... And that goes to like, yeah, you can meet that
[44:26.020 --> 44:31.540]  criteria. You can find something that tastes good that also gets you fucking high as fuck or
[44:32.100 --> 44:41.220]  medicated or whatever. Yeah. We were saying before that, pretty much all of the cannabis today
[44:41.220 --> 44:46.500]  should get you high. It should get you high, so it really comes back to like, flavor and smell.
[44:47.860 --> 44:52.100]  So I just read something really silly. Terps are why shit is so watered down these days. That
[44:52.100 --> 44:57.140]  doesn't really make any sense to me. Water doesn't really have a lot of flavor. Terps has
[44:57.140 --> 45:02.820]  flavor. That doesn't really correlate to me. You know what I mean? Like, terpless varieties that
[45:02.820 --> 45:11.860]  are Instagram user-friendly and visually stunning are why stuff is watered down when it comes to
[45:12.420 --> 45:17.220]  the terping profile. If you're talking about watered down as far as like, bottlenecking
[45:17.220 --> 45:23.300]  genetics and like, stuff isn't to your privy or isn't as a pure hybrid as it should be,
[45:24.660 --> 45:32.100]  that's just your opinion, fam. But like, watered down and terps are completely... Water, terps,
[45:32.660 --> 45:40.180]  different. Different, you know? And I don't think that's the case. And if you mean watered down as
[45:40.180 --> 45:46.260]  far as effect is concerned, I could see where you're coming from with that, because people aren't
[45:46.340 --> 45:53.780]  aiming towards just getting you high. It's weird, but I've hung out with dudes that are like, man,
[45:53.780 --> 45:59.700]  I got this crazy THC percentage, but hey, dude, there's other stuff that's not even like, hidden
[45:59.700 --> 46:05.220]  stats to say the least, that we're not even charting that aren't illegal. And like, it's just
[46:05.860 --> 46:10.740]  you could throw that out the window, because, you know. Yeah. And I see his comment later,
[46:10.740 --> 46:17.700]  looks more like a gas kind of OG flavor. So, you know, it's Kevin Jodry. I steal this from him all
[46:17.700 --> 46:22.980]  the time. He's been saying it for fucking ever. But fruity, floral, gassy, and earthy. Those are
[46:22.980 --> 46:28.500]  your four major categories. You can almost break all strains down into one of those four, and
[46:28.500 --> 46:33.780]  everybody's not going to like all four of them at the same time. So, yeah, I think that's what he's
[46:33.780 --> 46:39.940]  getting at. Smoke to medicate, not to taste or smell. Yeah, some people do. I like my medicine
[46:39.940 --> 46:46.260]  to taste good, though. So, I look for the flavors. I usually take some like really, you know, I'm a
[46:46.260 --> 46:52.660]  dab smoker. I smoke flower too. And it's always coming down to like, it's got to taste good.
[46:52.660 --> 46:57.460]  It's just like, I'm not going to sit here and smoke. I'm not even going to name strains, because
[46:57.460 --> 47:02.100]  I'm just going to start upsetting people. But like, I'm going to smoke the papayas. I'm going to smoke
[47:02.100 --> 47:07.700]  even GMO, even if it's freaking all over the place. I'm still going to smoke GMO, even if it's like,
[47:08.580 --> 47:14.020]  you know, it's just the foundation of my high. But at the end of the day, to each their own. And I
[47:14.020 --> 47:20.260]  just feel like, you know, I just skimmed through so many seeds and smoke even more weed. So, I just
[47:20.260 --> 47:25.700]  feel like, you know, I just have my own little say. Well, that's the fun thing, especially about
[47:25.700 --> 47:30.100]  shows like this, you know, seed collectors, because there is such a variety. Whatever you're into,
[47:30.100 --> 47:36.260]  you can get it. You can find it. So, Dave, you're talking gassy. What the,
[47:37.700 --> 47:40.500]  other than the mean genes, what gas have you pulled lately?
[47:41.140 --> 47:47.940]  Oh, have I pulled lately? As far as the seeds go, you got the Nughead there. That should be
[47:48.500 --> 47:53.620]  extra gassy with the sour diesel headband. Nughead. So, Skunk Tech. Okay. Skunk Tech.
[47:55.540 --> 47:59.700]  Skunk Tech's got some good stuff. I love getting clones from that guy too. They're a little pricey,
[47:59.700 --> 48:04.180]  but that's okay. Not $2,000 pricey, but that's okay. It's all good.
[48:05.940 --> 48:08.820]  Yeah. It's all a return investment too.
[48:09.460 --> 48:15.860]  True. It's a personal, I love collecting it. I enjoy collecting it. I love popping them too.
[48:16.500 --> 48:20.740]  It's just, I just never seem to have the room to pop the fuck at all. That's my problem.
[48:21.860 --> 48:28.820]  Yeah. So, you know, hopefully we'll live forever. But let's see, something that I've popped lately,
[48:28.820 --> 48:32.980]  I've actually, I can load up right now. Some Dairy Queen. This is some old TGA stock.
[48:34.020 --> 48:41.460]  Dairy Queen. Oh, why am I on the small screen? How about that? Okay. Boom. This came to me from
[48:41.460 --> 48:49.860]  Miranda Family Farms. It was kind enough. He actually did a giveaway on Eagle Show, on Eagle
[48:49.860 --> 48:56.180]  Gardens. Sent me out some stuff. Bike seat. He's working with some TGA stuff. Hazy Margarita times
[48:56.740 --> 49:02.660]  Overdrive. Haven't popped into these yet, but I've known some people that actually ran this one,
[49:02.660 --> 49:09.940]  the Seesaw Sally, Lemon Stilton times Zinger. And then Two Soups, Zinger times the PBJ. So
[49:11.380 --> 49:14.980]  I'll be diving into those soon. Miranda Family Farms. He's out on the East Coast.
[49:15.540 --> 49:21.860]  It's got a good thing going with the TGA and then Subcool, the Dank subsequently.
[49:22.660 --> 49:28.660]  Is that anything you've ever gotten into, Dave? Did you ever get into any of the older TGA or
[49:28.660 --> 49:33.540]  when it became the Dank, Subcool's the Dank, or Miss Jill now as well? Miss Jill Genetics?
[49:34.100 --> 49:40.900]  I haven't personally. Only one thing I've ever run was a Cindy 99 Vortex.
[49:41.940 --> 49:44.820]  Okay. That was from Duke Diamond. That was
[49:45.780 --> 49:48.020]  very good, but it wasn't pure Vortex.
[49:49.460 --> 49:56.020]  Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I'm still on the big screen. I'm paying attention tonight.
[49:56.660 --> 50:03.380]  I saw a question a very long time ago in the chat asking about what did you get with your burgers?
[50:05.140 --> 50:11.780]  Oh, with my burgers and beers, I got two males. Unfortunately. So I didn't keep them around
[50:11.780 --> 50:15.860]  because I haven't run the strain yet. I'm not familiar with it. So I'm not going to keep a male
[50:15.860 --> 50:22.020]  that I don't know what to somewhat expect, but I have other opportunities and I'm going to be taking
[50:22.020 --> 50:28.340]  them because I really do want to hunt that. It's the burgers and beers. It was a cross of, let's
[50:28.340 --> 50:34.580]  see, put me back here. Donnie Burger and then Root Beer. And kind of one of the things that I enjoyed
[50:35.300 --> 50:41.620]  or enjoy about the ranch as well. So actually I'll sidetrack. I did pop the purple pineapple
[50:41.620 --> 50:47.140]  at the same time, popped a couple of these. Both of them were female. Both of them were very uniform.
[50:47.700 --> 50:53.140]  They grew freaking beautifully, good shape, didn't have to do any training, dense, tight nugs.
[50:54.660 --> 51:00.100]  Actually that's curing in the other room right now. But yeah, back to this one though, like
[51:00.820 --> 51:04.260]  I will be popping them again. But the one thing I like about some of his stuff
[51:05.060 --> 51:10.500]  is where he sources them from. The provenance is important because there's a lot of
[51:11.940 --> 51:18.020]  Spanish and European seed banks that will say, what did Masonic come out with today? What did
[51:18.020 --> 51:23.860]  he just release? Oh, okay, sweet. Let's add the word feminized. Guess what? We've got XYZ feminized.
[51:23.860 --> 51:32.340]  So they do that a lot. So provenance is important, man. That's whack. Yeah. As far as
[51:32.340 --> 51:40.020]  paper trails are concerned, that matters big time. Like, hey, where'd you get
[51:40.020 --> 51:44.900]  that? Oh, got it from here. And hopefully you could ask them and things like that.
[51:45.460 --> 51:52.340]  This Instagram culture is a big part of that actually, with the auctions that happen here,
[51:52.340 --> 51:57.460]  with the people that come up here. Like, oh, it's from Homeboy on Instagram. And it's like,
[51:57.460 --> 52:01.700]  oh, is he a good guy? Yeah, he's a good guy. He's friends with yada yada. Okay, it's a real
[52:01.700 --> 52:09.300]  strength. That's the paper trails that we'll have. But hopefully there'll be something better than
[52:09.300 --> 52:15.220]  that. But with the amount of hobbyists coming out at this rate, it's kind of hard to track
[52:15.220 --> 52:24.420]  that down. But we just got to rely on just being in good circles and intuition. But that's why we
[52:24.420 --> 52:28.660]  mingle and talk to be like, hey, man, you probably don't want those European seeds. They're probably
[52:28.660 --> 52:33.380]  not the real ones. I seen someone here earlier when you were going down the list of the cheese
[52:33.380 --> 52:38.020]  varieties that you had. They're like, oh, one of them. They're like, that's not legit. And
[52:38.820 --> 52:46.020]  it goes to show. Yeah. And I mean, a good example is I have a person I know,
[52:46.020 --> 52:52.900]  she grows the purple punch, and she grows it very freaking well. It's absolutely not the purple
[52:52.900 --> 52:57.620]  punch. But that's what was on the seed pack from the distributor. So she's convinced it's purple
[52:57.620 --> 53:05.380]  punch. And like, there's absolutely, unless it's the unicorn Fino that I've never seen out of
[53:05.380 --> 53:09.300]  anybody who's ever grown purple punch, it's not freaking purple punch. But that doesn't
[53:09.300 --> 53:14.900]  automatically mean it's going to be bad either. That's kind of the fun roll of the dice sometimes
[53:14.900 --> 53:18.820]  with these companies. It's like, oh, it's the latest hottest name that you just heard put on
[53:18.820 --> 53:23.940]  a package. Well, I'll try it. It might be really good. I don't care about the name so much.
[53:23.940 --> 53:30.900]  Yeah. Me and purple punch go way back. I got the cut, the villages cut of the purple punch.
[53:30.980 --> 53:36.260]  And I was running that for like, when it was hot. And I gave it to one of my buddies,
[53:36.260 --> 53:41.940]  and he wouldn't stop running it. And that kind of ended our friendship. You know what I mean?
[53:41.940 --> 53:47.620]  I'm just playing around. That's a joke. That's how bad purple punch can be. It ends friendships.
[53:47.620 --> 53:54.580]  But that's a joke. That's a joke. Well, there's always, you know what, a lot of the good strains
[53:54.740 --> 54:02.580]  cause a loss of friends. Throughout the history, there's that sour, the whole sour diesel story
[54:02.580 --> 54:08.820]  about kind of guys on the East Coast, like a lot of people who got pissed off because they had it
[54:08.820 --> 54:14.340]  or didn't have it. Yeah. Life is a little competitive sometimes. I'm glad it's not so
[54:14.340 --> 54:20.980]  much that way now with the availability of seeds, the availability of cuts, and just the knowledge.
[54:21.300 --> 54:27.220]  No doubt. And there's so many people that you could go, you know, vibe with. And, you know,
[54:27.220 --> 54:33.780]  there's so many pockets of, and sex in this, even in amongst this Instagram, you know, community.
[54:33.780 --> 54:39.220]  I know there's Reddit and then there's, you know, the old forms and shit. You know, there's probably
[54:39.220 --> 54:44.980]  a discord, a couple of discord ones and just things like that. So it's cool to see, like,
[54:46.180 --> 54:48.740]  you know, there's options, you know? Yeah.
[54:49.300 --> 54:53.860]  Well, what did you just throw up there, Dave? I saw you, I see you added something to the stack
[54:53.860 --> 54:59.620]  there. Yeah, just a few different things. Euro burgers and beer, but we've got the unicorn,
[54:59.620 --> 55:09.700]  July 33, a bunch of a mean gene, a bunch of skunk tech, Josh D999 at Sky Jaro. I got this one from
[55:10.660 --> 55:20.100]  Nick, triangle Kush S1, loud OG Fino with the OG OG Jaro. Yeah, you got those from the gene.
[55:21.060 --> 55:26.100]  Now triangle Kush goes back a long ways to like Florida.
[55:26.100 --> 55:27.140]  It's a hot topic there.
[55:27.700 --> 55:28.500]  That's a hot topic.
[55:29.060 --> 55:33.220]  If it's the real OG or is it? That's just a matter of opinion.
[55:34.740 --> 55:38.020]  I grew those ghost OG Sky Jaros. Those were really good.
[55:38.980 --> 55:39.480]  Nice.
[55:39.940 --> 55:41.780]  Is that a big one? Did you do that outdoors?
[55:42.500 --> 55:47.620]  Yeah, I did those outdoors. Actually, I didn't really get too many full expressions on those.
[55:47.620 --> 55:54.260]  I grew them really, really stout, really short, but I did get some seed stock off of it. So I'm
[55:54.260 --> 55:58.260]  gonna try to find that terp at least amongst that seed stock.
[55:58.820 --> 56:06.420]  Nice. I see a question in chat, Nick up in Eureka. No, I believe Nick Risen, Lime Rising Farm.
[56:06.420 --> 56:14.500]  Yes, that's exactly what it is. And I believe this Sunday on FCP, they're going to do an auction.
[56:14.500 --> 56:21.940]  Cool. You would know. Yeah, I've seen he's had a stint put in the other day. He's if you guys
[56:21.940 --> 56:28.020]  follow him on Instagram, you can definitely catch up and get the man your support. So that's cool.
[56:28.020 --> 56:33.140]  That will be here Sunday doing another seed auction. So I know where Dave will be.
[56:33.860 --> 56:38.180]  I donated to this one. So I probably won't be participating.
[56:39.220 --> 56:43.380]  You're bidding your own shit back. I sent the wrong box. Damn it.
[56:46.340 --> 56:52.740]  So how do you, Masonic, do you ever host auctions yourself? It sounds like you kind of participate
[56:52.740 --> 56:57.220]  in them when they catch your fancy. But do you do that as well? Or do you just kind of straight,
[56:57.620 --> 57:03.460]  here's the deal. Get it while you can. Yeah. I do my share of charity and
[57:05.220 --> 57:08.180]  every day is charity over here. I'm always in a giving mood.
[57:11.540 --> 57:18.420]  It just is. I do one big bang a year, a couple here and there. I go to the auctions. I drop
[57:18.420 --> 57:26.820]  here and there. Do you ever stand around in your shop and play Oprah? You get a pack
[57:27.060 --> 57:37.700]  and you get a pack. No. Not yet. Not yet. But I'm whoever, go support Nick. He needs help. Go
[57:38.660 --> 57:43.060]  Future Cannabis Project. Check that out. They always got some shit that could upgrade your
[57:43.060 --> 57:49.540]  garden up in there. Always good to uplift the community. Only we got each other's back. So
[57:50.500 --> 57:56.340]  you know, keep that in mind when you're participating. And there's good karma points
[57:56.900 --> 58:04.820]  and you get some dope ass beans. So, you know, homie needs some help. So go holler at Nick, man.
[58:06.020 --> 58:11.620]  For real. I know I have. So, you know. Yeah. You've definitely not only been a
[58:11.620 --> 58:17.140]  participator in those auctions you've donated, you've been a solid dude for the community.
[58:17.860 --> 58:24.820]  No doubt. No doubt. I know times can be tough. And, you know, like I said,
[58:25.380 --> 58:33.140]  we only got each other's backs. That's it. That's true. Well, you do a lot, which is good.
[58:33.140 --> 58:38.660]  And, you know, just even the hunting, doing those hunts, you might find something that you really
[58:38.660 --> 58:46.180]  enjoy that might make it out there that is like the answer to someone's insomnia. So people doing,
[58:46.180 --> 58:51.620]  you know, any amount really is good. But the more you can, the better, because that's hopefully how
[58:51.620 --> 58:58.740]  we find stuff. And you see you seem pretty unconcerned with giving out the cuts. Like
[58:59.380 --> 59:05.620]  you don't seem like too much of a hoarder there. Is that is there just kind of reason for that? Or
[59:06.420 --> 59:12.820]  you like having backups out there? It doesn't make or break. Many people like to revolve their
[59:13.620 --> 59:21.460]  craft and their persona around just that one cut. But it's like, that's not how I operate.
[59:23.620 --> 59:28.180]  No one's going to do what I do, how I do it, or I'm not worried about what other people are doing.
[59:28.180 --> 59:34.260]  And they could have the same tools and I could give it to them. But like, I'm a whole different
[59:34.260 --> 59:40.980]  lane. I'm me. Like there's only one person like this and they should think the same way.
[59:40.980 --> 59:44.820]  And that's why it's and yeah, I get it. I respect the homies that give me cuts and they're like,
[59:44.820 --> 59:49.540]  hey, dude, don't give that to nobody. Don't give it to nobody. And it's that easy, just as easy as
[59:49.540 --> 59:55.860]  it is as not giving it to people. Not that cut, but like stuff that I find myself and acquire
[59:55.860 --> 01:00:01.540]  myself that are up for grabs. Like if I go pay a thousand dollars for something like a cut,
[01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:05.940]  I'm not going to turn around and be like, hey, this is a thousand dollars. I'm going to be like,
[01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:11.140]  hey guys, I got a fucking handful, but you know, go spend X amount of money and here's a free
[01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:16.900]  fucking cut. And it's usually, you know, very affordable. So just things like that. And I do
[01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:22.100]  put some respect on some stuff. There's some stuff that isn't in my best interest to give out. But
[01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:26.980]  as far as back to tie into that, yeah, it's also to keep it alive. You know, you put it in the
[01:00:26.980 --> 01:00:31.220]  network and they'll tell you if it's good. If it's good, they'll keep it around. And that's how you
[01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:36.420]  also know if something's good. Cause like I put a Panama red into the network. I grew it back in
[01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:42.740]  2019 and it's been around since, you know, late 2020 it's been around and people just keep it
[01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:46.340]  around. And I'm just like, damn, you guys still got that around. I still have it around. Why do
[01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:50.820]  I have it around? Cause it's like, it's a little history lesson. It's fucking Panama red. So I just
[01:00:50.820 --> 01:00:55.780]  kind of just keep it around for shits and giggles, kind of ornamental more than anything. And some
[01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:59.140]  people dig it. Some people are like, damn, that's some good weed, man. I'm just like, damn,
[01:00:59.140 --> 01:01:04.100]  well, power to you, fam. Yeah. I had somebody actually six, seven months ago asked me like,
[01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:08.980]  dude, where can I get Panama red? And at the time I was saying, I didn't really know,
[01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:13.380]  but within the week I, one of the people on Dago was working with it. So I'm like, ah,
[01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:20.660]  here you go. Hit them up. Get it, get it hooked up. Which yeah, that's cool. The preservation too.
[01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:24.900]  And you know, I understand not giving out some things cause you might want to keep working it.
[01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:29.220]  You might have other plans for it. So it's not the, you know, it's not the painted picture yet.
[01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:33.620]  It's just the sketch. But not everything's for everyone. I hate to say it. Like,
[01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:39.620]  yeah, it's true. You know, like I got some cuts that the homie hit me up the other day and he
[01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:43.940]  probably knows what I'm talking about right now that his hands, he's like, Hey, is, is, he's like,
[01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:49.700]  is that one up for grabs? And I'm like, not that one. And he's just like, I knew it. And I'm just
[01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:56.100]  like, you know, so it's, it's, it can go both ways, you know, like, or the homie gave me a cut.
[01:01:56.100 --> 01:02:00.100]  He's like, Hey man, let me do some work with it before you can start giving it to people.
[01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:09.060]  Don't tell me. Yeah. Fair enough. It's easy to respect. Yeah. And, and I was this close to start
[01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:14.180]  giving it out and he hits me up. He's like, Hey dude, remember I told you, I was like, you did
[01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:20.660]  like, thank you for telling me. Cause I don't give a fuck, you know, I'm just like, and I'm
[01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:26.660]  like, honestly, I don't care. Like, like I was this close to giving it out, but I totally spaced,
[01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:32.260]  you know, but it's cause I'm dealing with, you know, so much shit. So it's like, of course it
[01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:35.940]  fucking slipped me. And then he's like, yeah, yeah. I'm like doing stuff with that right now.
[01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:40.180]  Just wait for me. I'm like, man, you don't even have to explain yourself. Like you did tell me
[01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:45.780]  that I remember now, like you specifically said, don't let me work with that before you start
[01:02:45.780 --> 01:02:50.180]  giving it out. And I'm like, and he knows what I'm talking about. Shout out to homie Hydro.
[01:02:50.740 --> 01:02:51.860]  Good, a good guy right there.
[01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:59.140]  Dave, you were talking about cuts earlier, getting some cuts or working with
[01:02:59.140 --> 01:03:06.820]  cuts. What, what tends to be, or seems to be the best like packaging for cuts?
[01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:12.660]  Cause I'm sure you've seen a few I've seen like 3d printed, you know, plastic caps with a light
[01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:16.580]  you put on the solo cup. That looks good. I've seen, you know, like the four packs with, you
[01:03:16.580 --> 01:03:21.140]  know, that fit the rock wall in the bottom, just like little plastic. Is there anything that seems
[01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:27.860]  to work better than others? I like the, it's like a plastic tubes with little rubber caps on the end.
[01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:35.140]  Yes. Yes. Those seem to work really well. Honestly, as long as it gets there.
[01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:41.460]  What was that? I'm just playing. They're like, like, like the, the tubes, right? Yeah. At first
[01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:45.700]  I didn't know how to take them out. I'm like sticking a stick in there and all this crap.
[01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:50.340]  Apparently you got to smack them out. Right. Or something like that. I forgot.
[01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:55.220]  Skunktech told me, but I already forgot. I even made a how to video.
[01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:58.420]  I made a, how to take your clone out of the tube video. And I forgot.
[01:03:58.420 --> 01:04:06.260]  I mean, I opened the cap and I grabbed the plug and it comes out.
[01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:11.060]  What do you do? Like you like kind of do this or you like kind of go like that.
[01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:17.940]  Yeah. Sometimes it's sometimes it's all the way in there. Sometimes they are stuck. Sometimes the
[01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:23.380]  plugs are a little like really big and you kind of got to really almost grab like a pen or something
[01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:30.900]  on the other side and jab it through. Which, which, which, what was the first skunk signal
[01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:33.780]  clone that was dropped or the first claim cell that was dropped?
[01:04:35.540 --> 01:04:44.100]  Oh man. I don't even remember anymore. Was it Tahoe? Was it Tahoe? I don't think so. I think
[01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:50.900]  that was later. Was it GMO root beer? No, that was later. What was it? I think it might've been
[01:04:50.900 --> 01:04:55.620]  the GMO root beer is one of the first ones he dropped. I think I got the Tahoe before I got
[01:04:55.620 --> 01:05:03.380]  the GMO root beer. Tahoe came later. Look, yeah. Somebody's in here. You guys are on it.
[01:05:05.460 --> 01:05:08.260]  What was the first one? Hey yo Skunk Tech get in here.
[01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:14.500]  Send out the skunk signal.
[01:05:15.140 --> 01:05:20.180]  Yo, but I've gotten, I've gotten a handful of skunk tech clones as well. I try to make it my
[01:05:20.180 --> 01:05:25.140]  mission to get everyone he dropped. I was pretty persistent about it. I might've missed one or two,
[01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:32.020]  especially recently. I haven't been grabbing too much stuff onto the neck with ship right now. So
[01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:37.060]  I'm just working on what I got. He did give me a bunch of his headband hybrids and I did get
[01:05:37.060 --> 01:05:42.500]  to hang out with him and smoke some of them before he like dropped some of them. Yeah.
[01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:47.780]  Shout out Skunk Tech. We go way back at like Emerald cup or some shit. We were on the bus
[01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:54.500]  and he had some sour gelato, you know, number five or some shit and he gave me some nugs of it.
[01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:59.220]  And this is before the root beer hype. And I'm like, Hey, there's a seed in it. He's like,
[01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:03.940]  Oh, I'm doing like a root beer project right now. And it might be root beer there. And I'm
[01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:10.180]  at the time I thought nothing of it. I go home, I grow the bag seed and sure enough, it had,
[01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:16.020]  it had like root beer now that I like, not even now, like, you know, when I thought about it later
[01:06:16.020 --> 01:06:20.420]  and I'm like, damn, like I could see the root beer in there, you know? And I crossed it to
[01:06:20.420 --> 01:06:26.100]  Wilson of course, but yeah, I had the sour gelato five. Well, we'll just say it's a mystery cross
[01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:30.980]  still times Wilson, but allegedly it was the root beer, you know? And then I have,
[01:06:31.540 --> 01:06:34.580]  you know, followed up with him on that conversation. He's like, yeah, yeah. Like
[01:06:34.580 --> 01:06:39.300]  that's, that's what happened. And I'm just like, fuck yeah. You know, like been tapped in on the
[01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:45.460]  root beer turds. That's pretty dope. Yeah. That's a, that's a happy accident. Cause I've heard from
[01:06:46.260 --> 01:06:51.460]  I think it was, you know, Dutch blooms that the, you know, the Rupert turf is there. Maybe it was
[01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:57.460]  me and Jean. But it's elusive. It's not every, every one you pop that you're going to get the
[01:06:57.460 --> 01:07:02.260]  root beer turds out of it. So that's, that's what I was looking for when I was popping the burgers
[01:07:02.260 --> 01:07:08.340]  and beers. I'm like, I want to experience this root beer. So I've smoked and grown GMO root beer
[01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:17.860]  in flower form and hash Rosin form. I've smoked the root beer BX two that ranch has that Byron
[01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:26.660]  group. And that sour gelato was another representation of it. And I also grew the
[01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:33.540]  root beer pure face off tie from source. So like, these are all my experiences with root beer.
[01:07:33.540 --> 01:07:40.340]  And I found a common theme amongst these and it's kind of like a, like a cushy,
[01:07:40.340 --> 01:07:45.380]  like it's kind of like cushy, like a sharp pure cush. That's, that's my, my best way to describe
[01:07:45.380 --> 01:07:51.060]  it. And it's very subtle. It is very subtle. It is very smooth. And, and, and, and all these
[01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:56.820]  experiences, like when I smoked the GMO root beer, it kind of toned down the ranchiness and, and,
[01:07:56.820 --> 01:08:02.580]  and, and made it more cushy, you know, it's a little sweet, a little bit of sweetness on the
[01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:08.660]  back end. I wouldn't say sweet cause sweet correlates to candy. So I would just say like,
[01:08:08.660 --> 01:08:15.860]  like, like cushy, like fire, you know, like I've got, I've got my bird, my cushier that I'll go
[01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:21.780]  for next. I don't even know how to, I'm terrible at this, but you know, just that, that's, that's
[01:08:21.780 --> 01:08:28.260]  my best way to describe it. So I found it to be more of like a creamy, the GMO root beer,
[01:08:28.580 --> 01:08:34.100]  creamy root beer kind of. Yeah. So, so exactly. It kind of toned it down, you know, it, it took
[01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:38.500]  out the ranchiness from the GMO. So, you know, that, that kind of, that kind of, you know,
[01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:46.020]  that's, I see that, you know, I'm laughing because there's a rad comment here. Masonic
[01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:50.420]  should be on the Simpsons. His knowledge of Terps is from the future. I just love to see you as a
[01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:57.860]  Simpsons character. Call it Matt Groening. Where's Matt Groening when you need him?
[01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:01.620]  I think that's his name. Is that how you say his last name?
[01:09:03.620 --> 01:09:09.060]  I don't know, man. That's, I've always said like groin. It's funner.
[01:09:11.940 --> 01:09:18.820]  I don't know. Yeah, no, I'm just going down that road because I'm silly.
[01:09:19.620 --> 01:09:21.860]  Any of you guys catch the new Beavis and Butthead movie?
[01:09:22.900 --> 01:09:27.620]  I haven't seen it yet. All right. Beavis and Butthead do the universes out. It's on
[01:09:28.340 --> 01:09:30.660]  Paramount plus. You owe me Paramount plus.
[01:09:31.620 --> 01:09:35.300]  But yeah. Paramount plus has South Park now too or something like that.
[01:09:35.940 --> 01:09:41.060]  Okay. They've been advertising the shit out of it. South Park is now on Paramount plus.
[01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:46.100]  It's like damn Paramount plus you guys. Well, they're doing things, you know, that's cool.
[01:09:46.580 --> 01:09:47.620]  Paramount plus.
[01:09:47.620 --> 01:09:48.420]  They're going hard on it.
[01:09:48.420 --> 01:09:52.580]  Yeah, they're like special licensed movies now with South Park coming out on Paramount plus.
[01:09:54.100 --> 01:09:59.220]  Dude, the original South Park movie was pretty fucking good though. I mean, can we all agree on
[01:09:59.220 --> 01:10:05.940]  that? I grew up on it. I can't even repeat the first line that came to my head when he said that.
[01:10:05.940 --> 01:10:10.020]  That's how beautiful that movie is. I can't.
[01:10:11.940 --> 01:10:14.820]  As long as we don't start calling each other Uncle Fucker, we'll be good.
[01:10:14.820 --> 01:10:18.820]  Oh my God. That's exactly the line I was fucking thinking of.
[01:10:18.820 --> 01:10:25.780]  Shut your fucking face Uncle Fucker. You're a dirty ball of. No, okay. Family show. Family show.
[01:10:25.780 --> 01:10:26.020]  Yeah.
[01:10:29.620 --> 01:10:32.260]  Talks to Uncle Fucker. We're getting it all in tonight.
[01:10:32.260 --> 01:10:35.780]  Yes. So why, when is Uncle Fucker coming out, Masonic?
[01:10:36.660 --> 01:10:41.140]  Uncle Fucker. That one is the, yeah, we're doing that one. It has to be a Canadian
[01:10:42.180 --> 01:10:43.940]  collaboration of some sort, you know.
[01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:49.220]  If you cross like the maple leaf with something else, you might be able to get it.
[01:10:52.580 --> 01:10:55.860]  Did you ever get in, either of you, did you guys ever get into some of the older
[01:10:55.860 --> 01:11:02.260]  Sensi Seeds stuff or like the maple leaf or, you know, four way, some of the more traditional?
[01:11:03.220 --> 01:11:08.500]  I'm more privy to the Instagram culture of Strains, like how it like came hard on the
[01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:16.580]  scene. I'm not from the form days. I'm 29 years old also. So yeah, so like, I just know what I
[01:11:16.580 --> 01:11:22.820]  know. Like I grew up smoking stress and then I got introduced to OG and then the medical scene out
[01:11:22.820 --> 01:11:27.780]  here in Cali. And then I just like started growing bag seeds and whatever random clone I could get
[01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:33.060]  my hands on. And then like, I kind of went on the internet, typed in how to grow weed and,
[01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:38.260]  you know, a couple of forms came up and I try to get privy to like Grass City one time, but like,
[01:11:38.820 --> 01:11:43.540]  it wasn't really friendly. So I kind of made a post and I had tried to have my wife help me
[01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:48.340]  follow up on it. It didn't really help out. I was caught up in real life, but still growing pot.
[01:11:48.340 --> 01:11:54.740]  And then Instagram kind of becomes popular. And I'm like, I go on Instagram and I'm go down this
[01:11:54.740 --> 01:12:00.260]  rabbit hole of already established Instagram weed, you know, people. And I just kind of, you know,
[01:12:00.260 --> 01:12:05.780]  those are the players of the game. And at the time, you know, there was like Subcool and guys
[01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:12.980]  like that, but I didn't even get privy to Subcool at the time, like Oni and Tiger Trees and Y East
[01:12:12.980 --> 01:12:18.660]  and, you know, like Exotic Mike and Capulator, all the guys that I would see at the actual events
[01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:23.860]  in person, like Ninja and, you know, some of them bigger than others. But like, those are the guys
[01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:29.940]  that I started getting privy to off the bat. And then I kind of worked my way from there. So like,
[01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:34.340]  you know, those are the guys that I've seen first and then I have to figure out everybody else.
[01:12:35.220 --> 01:12:41.140]  So I'm oblivious to a lot of stuff too. So like, it was like a fresh, like a fresh mind as far as
[01:12:41.140 --> 01:12:46.180]  like, even politics and the, and dramas and beefs were concerned. Like, oh, he doesn't like him or
[01:12:46.180 --> 01:12:50.420]  he did. I'm like, oh my God, even to this day, it's like, oh, like, you know, and then I'm part
[01:12:50.420 --> 01:12:54.900]  of it too now. Like, pull like me in there. Like you're part of it now too, motherfucker.
[01:12:57.860 --> 01:13:01.860]  And anybody over 10,000 followers is free, is fair game, right?
[01:13:02.740 --> 01:13:06.820]  Yeah. It's easy to throw, you know, when, when you're doing stuff, it's easy to be like,
[01:13:06.820 --> 01:13:13.060]  fuck that guy. Yeah. Yeah. You know, they, they, they tend to be vocal, but they're,
[01:13:13.060 --> 01:13:18.340]  they're the minority. So it doesn't, in the big picture is a lot of awesome people out there. A
[01:13:18.340 --> 01:13:23.700]  lot of people support what you do and whatever everybody's doing. You know, everybody's,
[01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:28.100]  everybody's got their haters. If you're doing good, you got some haters. I've had two so far
[01:13:28.100 --> 01:13:29.700]  and I love it. Thank you guys. Keep it up.
[01:13:34.580 --> 01:13:38.420]  How about, how about you, Dave? What the, who hates you?
[01:13:38.420 --> 01:13:41.140]  Bodhi's like, I don't know what you're talking about. You know,
[01:13:41.140 --> 01:13:44.580]  playing with seeds. Nobody can hate Bodhi. He's just like, what do you mean?
[01:13:46.420 --> 01:13:53.540]  So, okay. So we've got, we've got green Bodhi down in Eugene, who is a fun character to listen
[01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:59.460]  to. He's got some fun philosophies. He's done some good work. And then we also got Bodhi. Dave,
[01:13:59.460 --> 01:14:04.500]  I saw you, you had a pack from him earlier. That dude's elusive. That guy's on like my,
[01:14:04.500 --> 01:14:08.580]  my dream list to get ahold of, to freaking shoot the shit.
[01:14:08.580 --> 01:14:11.780]  You just did a dope thing with Burner. Did you see that?
[01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:12.820]  Motherfucker.
[01:14:16.180 --> 01:14:17.380]  Are you playing with me, dude?
[01:14:17.380 --> 01:14:23.220]  I am not fucking with you. I am not fucking with you. They did a whole album,
[01:14:23.220 --> 01:14:28.580]  a seed to sell album. And, and, and, and, and Bodhi is on the intro of the album.
[01:14:29.140 --> 01:14:33.060]  And, and they're doing a seed drop. And Al, look at your heart.
[01:14:37.700 --> 01:14:41.780]  I'm gonna call Burn right now. Be like, Hey bro, is it true? You're doing a release with
[01:14:42.740 --> 01:14:45.940]  the fucking plant more seeds. Oh my God.
[01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:55.940]  All right. My face hurts. Ah, shit. Let's see. Claude, I want my check kit. Oh,
[01:14:56.740 --> 01:15:00.740]  damn. I don't have any more. I was going to say, I've got one right here.
[01:15:01.300 --> 01:15:04.340]  So this is, this is, this is like my history packs. They usually come out.
[01:15:05.060 --> 01:15:08.660]  Where's, where's my stickers. I need a sticker. Damn it. I got to put a sticker on it.
[01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:15.060]  Oh, I got stickers everywhere. These, this, this is the history pack. There's only a few
[01:15:15.140 --> 01:15:20.660]  that go out there. Cause uh, I don't know. I just give my shit away, but bam, that's what it looks
[01:15:20.660 --> 01:15:26.580]  like. You get the little, the little twin peaks owl on your crate, open it up. I got some pictures
[01:15:26.580 --> 01:15:32.660]  on my Instagram on what they look like, but got to have fun with seed packs. Like I just asked
[01:15:32.660 --> 01:15:46.380]  big burn. If the drop is still happening. He's a, yeah. Oh my mother. I respect that dude.
[01:15:47.900 --> 01:15:57.420]  He's he's brilliant. He's brilliant. He's successful, man. Being successful makes you a
[01:15:57.420 --> 01:16:05.580]  target. I remember when I came up, it's like, Hey, you smoked weed dope. What's up? And that's,
[01:16:05.580 --> 01:16:13.820]  that's how weed works. There's like, fuck what you listen to. Yeah. Business. That's his business.
[01:16:14.060 --> 01:16:20.220]  Did he fuck your business up? Did he, but we're just doing something else now, but whatever.
[01:16:20.220 --> 01:16:25.980]  That's just my two cents, you know? And I do understand the stigma and, and, and, and like
[01:16:25.980 --> 01:16:31.580]  stuff being, you know, original, like, yeah, Wu-Tang clan has the dopest raps and they fucking,
[01:16:31.580 --> 01:16:35.580]  you know, they wrap their asses off and underground rap. Yeah, I get it. I know.
[01:16:36.540 --> 01:16:44.380]  It's all, it's all a little inside jokes too. People love to give me shit. Oh man. Yeah. But
[01:16:44.380 --> 01:16:50.220]  I will say my recent trip to Amsterdam, I definitely visited the cookies remodeled greenhouse.
[01:16:50.780 --> 01:16:54.540]  So the greenhouse down on the green mile, the main street and new and dyke.
[01:16:56.060 --> 01:17:01.580]  You gave it. Did you, it's the first time this news gets leaked out. You see guys,
[01:17:02.300 --> 01:17:07.660]  he's caving in. Now I got it. When I stepped on dudes were like,
[01:17:08.380 --> 01:17:12.780]  Oh, cookies. I'll never grow cookies. I'll never grow cookies. And then fucking,
[01:17:14.220 --> 01:17:19.340]  I give up. You know, they just all caved in every single last one of them. Gelato's cookies,
[01:17:19.340 --> 01:17:24.300]  everything. I don't, maybe there is a breeder. Maybe I'm just generalizing and just, you know,
[01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:29.180]  you know, putting everybody in the same fucking bucket. But as far as I'm concerned,
[01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:34.300]  everyone's like, fuck it. Just a runs cross. Fuck it. A gelato cross. Fuck it. Just whatever. It's
[01:17:34.300 --> 01:17:39.900]  what they want. Just, just do it. You know? Yeah. Yeah. Again, you know, it's hard to,
[01:17:39.900 --> 01:17:44.780]  it's hard to argue with the market because the consumers, they, they drive the market and they
[01:17:44.780 --> 01:17:50.460]  tell kind of growers what needs to be grown. And that is something that for a long time needs to
[01:17:50.460 --> 01:17:57.580]  be grown. So, you know, you can't, you can't argue that. I've sat in some pretty, like,
[01:17:58.300 --> 01:18:04.460]  you know, astute places where, where money's on the line and, and, and there's like grows and
[01:18:04.460 --> 01:18:09.260]  lights. And it's just all this stuff that, you know, I'm, I'm not used to, I'm, I'm used to the
[01:18:09.260 --> 01:18:15.100]  sun and just throwing shit out and just be like, dope, nice. I spent a bag of soil and my time and
[01:18:15.100 --> 01:18:22.060]  water on that. Beautiful. But these guys are like, is it purple? Does it yield? I'm just like, whoa,
[01:18:22.060 --> 01:18:27.980]  give me the fuck out of here. I'm getting dizzy. And that's, that's, that's where weed is at right
[01:18:27.980 --> 01:18:32.620]  now. Yeah. And that, and that sounds like the opposite of Bodie, which is why I kind of like,
[01:18:32.620 --> 01:18:37.820]  I've done, I did Doug, the interviews that he has done. And that's why I think it would be such a
[01:18:37.820 --> 01:18:43.580]  fun conversation. Cause he is, he's just seems to me again, I've never met him, but seems very laid
[01:18:43.580 --> 01:18:50.220]  back and just go with the flow and what is, is man. Especially after the collab, you know what
[01:18:50.300 --> 01:18:56.460]  I mean? It's solidified the go with the flow, man. Just go, go with the flow.
[01:18:56.460 --> 01:18:58.700]  Stan Mallow Well, that's good. Maybe now I can find his
[01:18:58.700 --> 01:18:59.740]  contact info somewhere.
[01:18:59.740 --> 01:19:03.740]  Dom Yeah, man. Shut up Bodie. I'm growing some
[01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:12.220]  Bodie gear. I grew his Goji. I grew his Goji. I have my keeper from the Goji. A buddy of mine
[01:19:12.220 --> 01:19:18.940]  back in the day, Warp Genetics grew his Gojis and did some F2s with him. And he gave me a bunch. And
[01:19:19.900 --> 01:19:24.780]  out of respects for Bodie, we never let those see the light of the day. Like no one has seen those
[01:19:24.780 --> 01:19:31.900]  Goji F2s. I have a bunch, no one's seen them. I probably should dig through them myself just for
[01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:37.820]  personal reasons. But yeah, that ties back into the conversation of just letting stuff out. Hey,
[01:19:37.820 --> 01:19:42.460]  man, like, you know, nah, there's stuff that I kind of put some respect on, you know, like,
[01:19:42.460 --> 01:19:51.660]  I'm not just gonna go pour out Goji F2 or Mac F2 because I did have the Mac when Capulator did his
[01:19:51.660 --> 01:19:59.260]  Mac release from a regular seed stock. We did some F2s, a buddy of mine, Paramount Grower, and I had
[01:19:59.260 --> 01:20:07.260]  some. And I'm like, yo, Cap, how would you feel if I gave these away as freebies? He's like, yo,
[01:20:07.260 --> 01:20:11.500]  how about you F2 your shit and give your shit away as freebies? And I'm like, oh, fuck.
[01:20:12.620 --> 01:20:18.700]  I'm locked in with Cap, but that's what he told me. And I'm just like, okay, like,
[01:20:19.260 --> 01:20:23.260]  and as long as it's how you play your cards right then and there, I could have been like,
[01:20:23.260 --> 01:20:30.220]  whatever, and just went ahead and, hey, guys, Mac F2's over here. And this is back then. And nah,
[01:20:30.220 --> 01:20:33.580]  I was like, hey, that's a bad fucking idea. I don't even know where the fuck I asked him.
[01:20:33.580 --> 01:20:40.300]  Like, let me get the fuck out of here. But that was my fucking, it just is what it is. I'm 29.
[01:20:40.300 --> 01:20:44.780]  I probably asked that when I was a dumb 25-year-old or something. You know what I mean?
[01:20:45.820 --> 01:20:52.060]  Just playing my cards, doing my thing. And thank God I didn't do that. Thank God I never did that.
[01:20:52.060 --> 01:20:52.460]  You know?
[01:20:52.460 --> 01:20:59.180]  Yeah, you learn along the way, hopefully. That's a thing too. The more relationships you build too,
[01:20:59.180 --> 01:21:03.980]  you understand the importance of some things like that. Something like that could ruin a
[01:21:03.980 --> 01:21:08.860]  friendship that might last for years. It might produce many other great things. So, yeah.
[01:21:09.020 --> 01:21:13.980]  We did an official collaboration. So, if I would have fucking did that, I would have never been
[01:21:13.980 --> 01:21:19.100]  able to do the stranded, which was his shiver me timbers that he gave me a Tina. I pulled up
[01:21:19.100 --> 01:21:23.100]  to his facility and I crossed it to Wilson and we called it stranded. You know?
[01:21:25.580 --> 01:21:33.020]  I love that. So, where did you get the name Wilson? Obviously, I'm assuming the volleyball
[01:21:33.020 --> 01:21:36.860]  because it's on a lot of the graphics or the movie, but why Wilson?
[01:21:37.660 --> 01:21:44.700]  So, Wilson, okay. So, castaway. So, Wilson is banana, OG, papaya, times Tropicana F2.
[01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:53.180]  Banana, OG, papaya is castaway. So, castaway is banana, OG, papaya, times Tropicana F2. So,
[01:21:53.180 --> 01:21:59.020]  castaway times trop is Wilson. It's a play on words, castaway. It stemmed off the castaway,
[01:21:59.020 --> 01:22:05.260]  but turned into Wilson. And I didn't name castaway. I didn't name Wilson. Oni named
[01:22:05.260 --> 01:22:11.260]  those strains. And that goes back to the original packaging. If you see the original
[01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:18.220]  packaging on the seeds when they were first dropped, this is how I labeled them.
[01:22:19.020 --> 01:22:24.140]  Castaway times Tropicana F2. Right? This is my-
[01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:29.020]  Wow. That's like the OG card right there, right?
[01:22:29.260 --> 01:22:33.180]  That's the collector's item. That's the one that's going to be sitting in the Hemp Museum
[01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:40.010]  later. Oh, you're on mute. Let's see. Yep, you're muted. There you go.
[01:22:40.010 --> 01:22:47.530]  Cool. There we go. So, this is the original one, you see? And then I never would name my stuff.
[01:22:48.490 --> 01:22:49.450]  I would always-
[01:22:51.210 --> 01:22:54.350]  Do the crosses.
[01:22:55.070 --> 01:22:59.950]  Yeah, I would always do the crosses. But then it ended up in Oni's hands.
[01:23:00.270 --> 01:23:06.110]  Oni's hands. Official collaborative effort, not like no funny business.
[01:23:06.110 --> 01:23:07.070]  Right.
[01:23:07.950 --> 01:23:12.430]  And he named it Wilson. And he named the other four strains that I made for Oni. So,
[01:23:12.990 --> 01:23:20.590]  this is kind of- I still didn't name stuff. I still kept calling stuff. If I did a Death Star
[01:23:20.590 --> 01:23:25.550]  cross, I called it Death Star Wilson. If I did a Starburst cross, I called it Starburst Wilson.
[01:23:25.550 --> 01:23:32.590]  And it wasn't until maybe around 2019 when I started naming stuff. Because when I went to
[01:23:32.590 --> 01:23:38.350]  Emerald Cup 2018 and I sold tons of whatever, a bunch of seeds ended up in a bunch of people's
[01:23:38.350 --> 01:23:43.790]  hands, 2018 Emerald Cup. I went back home and the next harvest season or whatever,
[01:23:44.750 --> 01:23:49.790]  all my strains were lost amongst other names. People just started calling it whatever they
[01:23:49.790 --> 01:23:56.830]  wanted because it's not in their best interest to call something GMO I-95 Star Dog times Wilson.
[01:23:56.830 --> 01:23:58.990]  It's a mouthful.
[01:23:58.990 --> 01:24:06.510]  It's just like, hey, dude, what's Triangle Kush Tangy Tropicana Cherry Pie Tangy times Wilson?
[01:24:06.510 --> 01:24:11.150]  What should I call that? And I'm just like, fuck. So, they just started calling shit whatever the
[01:24:11.150 --> 01:24:15.950]  fuck they wanted. And I learned quickly, oh, I got to start naming this shit because
[01:24:16.910 --> 01:24:21.630]  I'm not going to have a paper trail as time goes by of who grew what. It's going to get
[01:24:21.630 --> 01:24:24.350]  lost in translation. So, I started naming shit.
[01:24:24.350 --> 01:24:27.310]  That's good. Do you have a rhyme or reason to it?
[01:24:27.310 --> 01:24:29.870]  When I name stuff?
[01:24:29.870 --> 01:24:30.190]  Yeah.
[01:24:30.910 --> 01:24:35.950]  It's usually a play on words or has to do with the actual plant.
[01:24:37.390 --> 01:24:44.110]  Cool. How about you, Dave? What are some of the otter names that you've come across in your
[01:24:44.110 --> 01:24:44.670]  collecting?
[01:24:45.630 --> 01:24:45.870]  Oh, man.
[01:24:45.870 --> 01:24:47.870]  Because there's some good ones out there.
[01:24:47.870 --> 01:24:52.750]  Oh, totally. We went over one earlier. I won't bring it up again for the 19th time. But
[01:24:53.550 --> 01:24:57.550]  Tight Ass is one I've seen. That was kind of an interesting name.
[01:25:02.750 --> 01:25:06.830]  Dog shit. There's so many out there. If you really think about it, kind of go down the line,
[01:25:07.390 --> 01:25:12.750]  especially nowadays. There's just so many crosses. People who don't really have the respect,
[01:25:12.830 --> 01:25:16.030]  they just threw a name on it. Don't really throw it out there.
[01:25:16.750 --> 01:25:26.430]  And then there's the influx of rap songs and artists. They drop a song, and of course,
[01:25:26.430 --> 01:25:30.270]  a bunch of dudes are going to drop a couple renditions of the same name, because especially
[01:25:30.270 --> 01:25:34.830]  if they're a common theme, there's some that you just can't blatantly jack. You can't just make a
[01:25:34.830 --> 01:25:40.270]  string called Blue Dream. Like, yo, bro, that one's established. But if a couple dudes make
[01:25:40.270 --> 01:25:46.990]  a peach fuzz, I wouldn't be surprised. Like, yeah, 3rd Gen made one, and then somebody else
[01:25:46.990 --> 01:25:52.270]  made one. And then, yeah, that one's an easy one. But as time goes by, there's some strains that,
[01:25:52.270 --> 01:26:00.670]  like, yo, you can't just jack that name. There's only one. But some are easy to rename, for sure.
[01:26:02.190 --> 01:26:06.190]  Northern Lights number 33. You guys never heard of that one.
[01:26:07.150 --> 01:26:11.870]  Is that an NL5G33 cross? That sounds kind of gnarly. I'd fuck with that.
[01:26:13.070 --> 01:26:18.430]  I would too. That would be, man. I do dig some of the older, the Amsterdam strains,
[01:26:18.430 --> 01:26:21.790]  where, you know, kind of talking about earlier, some of that older Scentsy Seed stuff.
[01:26:23.390 --> 01:26:27.390]  I like playing with it against some of the newer things, just to see what we find,
[01:26:27.390 --> 01:26:35.230]  see what can be recombined. But again, I do things at a snail's pace with the area I have.
[01:26:35.230 --> 01:26:43.320]  But it's all in fun. Yeah. You ever seen Friday? The movie Friday?
[01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:49.480]  Dude, yes. You know when Smokey's walking out the door,
[01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:52.200]  and he doesn't have enough money for the cigarettes? Yep.
[01:26:52.920 --> 01:26:54.040]  What does the mom tell him?
[01:26:56.520 --> 01:27:00.520]  No, tell him, make it enough, you know? Yes, yes. Make it enough.
[01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:05.720]  Yeah, that's how you got to deal with the seeds in the room, you know? You got to make it enough,
[01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:11.080]  you know? Peter in here, so what's up, Big Perm? I mean, Big Worm.
[01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:13.480]  What up, Big Worm? I mean, Big Worm.
[01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:24.280]  So here's my thing. I have seen Friday so many times. Okay, so you know when the fucking preacher
[01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:31.560]  comes home, and his wife's in there with the other dude? Or no, the preacher and the Miss Jackson,
[01:27:31.560 --> 01:27:36.520]  knock the dust off. Okay, so they're in there, right? Okay, husband comes home. He starts throwing
[01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:41.480]  the clothes out on the lawn. Watch the last two scenes, because he throws a yellow dress,
[01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:45.080]  and then he goes back inside, and he comes back out, and he throws the yellow dress again like
[01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:48.440]  it was never there. I'm just saying. That's from my ex-files.
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:56.200]  I watched it that many times. So both of you guys, have you ever tried to outsmoke Smokey,
[01:27:56.200 --> 01:27:58.360]  or at least keep up with Smokey? Go joint for joint.
[01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:05.160]  I could outsmoke a lot of people. I smoke a lot of pot, man.
[01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:13.000]  It's not something I'm too proud of either. It just is, man. I smoke a tough, tough man.
[01:28:13.720 --> 01:28:21.720]  I've actually puffed like as many joints as I could fit. I've rolled up in copious amounts of
[01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:24.840]  weed, man. I'm into it. And dabs.
[01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:32.520]  And dabs. Yeah, no, man. There's a point at it where he's smoking like three,
[01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:37.320]  four joints, where he's just getting high as a motherfucker. And yeah, you got to light him.
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:42.360]  However which way, man. I'm into it.
[01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:46.360]  If we could have... Now that Peter's on here, Peter, we got to figure out how we can have a
[01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:51.720]  community freaking watch of Friday, where everybody got their little bubble. Everybody
[01:28:51.720 --> 01:28:58.360]  could post up with their joints. And we see who the real smokers are. We got to make that happen.
[01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:03.240]  Oh, man. I'm into it. I'm into it.
[01:29:04.680 --> 01:29:08.840]  Cool. So Dave, you still there?
[01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:10.280]  I am still here.
[01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:15.000]  Hell yeah. Whip something out. What do you got? What do you got that's red?
[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000]  Anything red in your collection right now?
[01:29:28.360 --> 01:29:29.960]  This is like playing Uno, man.
[01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:31.880]  Any chocolate with Panama Red?
[01:29:34.120 --> 01:29:40.920]  Okay. See, you said screw the color red. You went legendary genetic. Is that Moscow?
[01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:41.880]  Or who is that?
[01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:42.600]  Snow High.
[01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:45.240]  Snow High. Okay. Snow High.
[01:29:45.240 --> 01:29:48.200]  This one has a red apple on it. Is that good enough?
[01:29:48.760 --> 01:29:49.640]  That works for me.
[01:29:50.200 --> 01:29:58.760]  All right. So check this out. This is Compound's... What is this one? Purple Churro and Exotic
[01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:00.360]  Squared.
[01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:02.200]  Nice.
[01:30:02.200 --> 01:30:04.520]  And it has apples and bananas on it.
[01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:11.480]  The fruit thing's getting big. Oh, that's a... Compound's great, man. They're doing a lot of
[01:30:12.680 --> 01:30:16.760]  good stuff that people are digging. I remember being in the Pacific Northwest is where I'm at,
[01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:23.320]  when they were coming up, doing a lot of different crosses. I was part of a Compound Records,
[01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:29.080]  actually. Compound Records Seattle, San Francisco. Anyways, drum and bass DJ thing.
[01:30:30.360 --> 01:30:33.480]  And I was like, man, I should hit these guys up, see if they want to collab,
[01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:38.920]  like give out some seeds with each mix CD. But I got too busy. That never happened.
[01:30:39.640 --> 01:30:41.960]  I wish I would have, because that was the early days of Compound.
[01:30:42.920 --> 01:30:43.400]  I'm sorry.
[01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:47.080]  Oh, there he goes. Flop it on the table right there.
[01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:49.720]  There you go. Actual color.
[01:30:49.720 --> 01:30:56.600]  Macklin times a rise. That Irie genetics. So yeah, I mentioned that earlier. When I mentioned
[01:30:56.600 --> 01:31:02.200]  Irie, we were talking about big sativas and ones that grow outside. I have a lemon sunrise from him.
[01:31:02.200 --> 01:31:06.200]  And if I do grow outdoors, that's the first one I'm planting, because I planted one of those in
[01:31:06.200 --> 01:31:12.600]  my indoor tent. Dude, that thing just took over the tent in a good way. Strong, vigorous, powerful
[01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:17.720]  plant, fabulous weed off of it. But I was like, holy shit, man, I can't grow that with other
[01:31:17.720 --> 01:31:23.720]  things in there. It just wants to smother everything. So that's going to be outside if I did
[01:31:23.720 --> 01:31:28.600]  it. I've been thoroughly impressed with anything I've grown from Ross and Jeff. It's all been
[01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:36.200]  really just perfect commercial driven weed. Just absolutely great yielders, great turf profiles.
[01:31:36.760 --> 01:31:38.040]  It's super vigorous.
[01:31:39.640 --> 01:31:43.560]  Nice. Let's see here. We got Charles Freeman. Where'd that comment go?
[01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:51.320]  I've got the Masonic LA Pure Kush times Panama Red times Wilson. Is that something?
[01:31:51.800 --> 01:31:58.200]  Yeah, that's a Cecil Crabtree. He did a LA PK Panama Red, and he gave me that seed stock back
[01:31:58.200 --> 01:32:05.320]  in 18, and I grew those out. Found some nice ones and crossed that to Wilson. And I kind of put that
[01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:11.400]  strain on the back burner with my current vision on as far as what I deemed worthy.
[01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:19.320]  And as I grow up, I change and shit. And yeah, that turned out to be one of the
[01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:24.040]  strains that the masses like, even though I kind of threw it on the back burner and gave it away
[01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:30.920]  as freebies or charged X amount of it because of even the demand for something like LA PK Panama
[01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:36.600]  Red Wilson. Yeah, what the fuck's that? Yo, I fucking have some. It's kind of turf. It's kind
[01:32:36.600 --> 01:32:42.360]  of like a train wrecking turf from when I popped those. And people got privy to it. Some people
[01:32:43.320 --> 01:32:51.160]  washed it. Some people got like 3%. Some people got like 5%. I know Relentless Melts washed some.
[01:32:51.160 --> 01:32:56.840]  I know New York Dill found an ice keeper in that. My buddy, Don't Come At Me With That Stupid Shit,
[01:32:57.480 --> 01:33:02.920]  he washed some and brought me some down. So a couple people have brought me back good examples
[01:33:02.920 --> 01:33:07.240]  of that one. But check this out. This is Ruby Red, the first one on the red subject.
[01:33:07.880 --> 01:33:13.480]  And does anyone know anything about Ruby Red? I heard it's... Is it a Skittles cross? What is this?
[01:33:15.880 --> 01:33:17.960]  I could probably find out. I've never looked myself.
[01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:21.320]  Come on, chat. Where are you at? You guys always know everything.
[01:33:23.640 --> 01:33:26.360]  Pretty intelligent. Let us know. Hook it up to Ruby Red.
[01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:35.800]  I know. I already showed the only red package I have earlier is this bike seat.
[01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:38.360]  Boy, did I pick the wrong one to call out.
[01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:49.240]  Let's see. Oh, man. What's next? Let's just do a random grab.
[01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:57.160]  Oh, this was one of the funnier names that I had. The Jinx Proof Genetics, but
[01:33:57.240 --> 01:34:07.320]  it's fire. I'm like that's a good name. It was a combination of straight fire times it's it.
[01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:15.960]  You know who has some gnarly names? Crane City Genetics. Have you seen their names on Crane City?
[01:34:15.960 --> 01:34:17.000]  Oh Crane City, no.
[01:34:17.720 --> 01:34:22.760]  They have some funky names. They have like… speaking of it's fire, they have like
[01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:28.520]  it's it or some shit. I forgot. They have some very, very silly names. Let me see if I have.
[01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:35.480]  I do get down on the silly names.
[01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:39.720]  Yeah, look. Here we go.
[01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:49.080]  This one's called Fire as Fuck.
[01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:56.040]  This one's called The Shit with a Z.
[01:35:02.280 --> 01:35:05.800]  It's almost like I love these. They're like band names, man.
[01:35:05.800 --> 01:35:06.760]  Glitterati.
[01:35:08.840 --> 01:35:11.400]  There better be some glitter in the packaging. I'm just saying.
[01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:13.800]  These are some silly names.
[01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:15.480]  I see Paris Hilton smoking that.
[01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:18.040]  Yeah, oh, the Glitterati.
[01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:21.560]  If that shows my age, I'm sorry. I mean the Kardashians.
[01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:26.120]  Nilla's times The Shit with a Z.
[01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:29.640]  Yeah, they got some funky names.
[01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:32.200]  Stoners can't spell, man. The hell.
[01:35:35.160 --> 01:35:36.120]  Super Soaker.
[01:35:38.680 --> 01:35:43.560]  Tell man, look up Vortex original name. You might not be able to say it out loud.
[01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:47.160]  I don't know which one it is.
[01:35:48.120 --> 01:35:50.840]  I've done some pretty stupid names for some strains, but
[01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:55.960]  those all in fun and it encapsulates the time and the era.
[01:35:57.160 --> 01:35:57.640]  Oh, yeah.
[01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:01.480]  Blue Nips. That's funny.
[01:36:02.040 --> 01:36:05.720]  Hey, at least it's in a blue bag, too. I appreciate that coordination there.
[01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:08.360]  Blue Nips, baby.
[01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:11.160]  Show me your Blue Nips.
[01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:11.560]  Yes.
[01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:16.040]  How many people just touched theirs? Come on, let's be real.
[01:36:17.640 --> 01:36:19.480]  If you got to get a Blue Nip, you might as well squeeze it.
[01:36:21.880 --> 01:36:25.480]  Oh, sure. What else did you have along those lines there?
[01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:27.240]  What's what's within reach for you, Dave?
[01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:44.800]  And I know we're probably keeping both of you guys a little late, Dave.
[01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:46.800]  I know you're on the East Coast, Masonic.
[01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:49.440]  Again, I really appreciate your time this evening.
[01:36:49.520 --> 01:36:55.040]  So we could kind of wrap it up soon if you guys like.
[01:36:55.040 --> 01:37:00.240]  But I want to give everybody in the chat the chance to scream something out.
[01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:01.200]  What do you want to see us?
[01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:04.080]  Give us something, man. Challenge us.
[01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:06.080]  Anybody got a package with a giraffe on it?
[01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:08.480]  I have a giraffe.
[01:37:09.120 --> 01:37:10.320]  I can show you my drip stick.
[01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:14.640]  Ask and ye shall receive.
[01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:16.160]  There's a giraffe for you guys.
[01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:18.000]  Two giraffes.
[01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:19.280]  Oh, shit.
[01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:24.400]  Oh, look at that.
[01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:28.000]  Are you are you higher than a giraffe's ass right now?
[01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:28.720]  I am.
[01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:32.880]  That's sick.
[01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:35.120]  I got I got a I got a pendant.
[01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:38.640]  A giraffe in the backyard.
[01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:41.840]  Oh, green, green goddess.
[01:37:42.720 --> 01:37:44.640]  The infamous pink taco string.
[01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:47.520]  Yeah, there's that one.
[01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:50.640]  That's like putting your lips on the pink taco.
[01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:54.000]  No, man.
[01:37:55.120 --> 01:37:56.400]  Oh, the string.
[01:37:56.960 --> 01:37:57.200]  Yeah.
[01:37:57.760 --> 01:37:59.360]  Okay, here's a good one for you.
[01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:02.400]  I think I saw something there, Dave, aka Bean Brain Gear.
[01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:03.040]  Love that guy.
[01:38:03.040 --> 01:38:08.480]  I gave away a pack of Romulan DX4 this morning.
[01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:11.200]  And I've grown tons of Romulan from him.
[01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:11.440]  Yeah.
[01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:13.760]  So I grew tons of Romulan.
[01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:18.000]  So I just gave a whole pack away that I have been, you know, blessed with
[01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:20.720]  to some of my people today this morning.
[01:38:21.760 --> 01:38:22.640]  Shout out those guys.
[01:38:23.920 --> 01:38:24.240]  Awesome.
[01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:25.600]  He was a fun conversation.
[01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:29.760]  If anybody wants to check that out, I think it was like a five and a half hour interview
[01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:32.160]  I did with him over on the FCPO2 channel.
[01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:35.920]  Oh, God, maybe three, three or four months ago.
[01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:37.040]  But that was frickin fun.
[01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:41.600]  All right, here's some aka Bean Brains because he's, you know, again, he has a lot of the
[01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:48.320]  some of the some of the older stuff, some of the classic, stable, ready to rock gear.
[01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:49.520]  What is that one, Dave?
[01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:51.600]  Williams Wonder.
[01:38:52.480 --> 01:38:53.120]  Oh, see?
[01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:54.640]  Yeah, Williams Wonder.
[01:38:54.640 --> 01:38:58.400]  And that was fun hearing the story too about that because I've heard all kinds of
[01:38:59.280 --> 01:39:00.640]  stories about that one.
[01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:05.520]  I grew Skunk Tech's Chem 91 Williams Wonder.
[01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:09.200]  And it was a Williams Wonder leaner because it wasn't a chem leaner as far as turps were
[01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:09.920]  concerned.
[01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:12.000]  And I still have that one and I keep it around.
[01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:16.080]  And, you know, yeah, Willie Willie Dog.
[01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:17.120]  I grew that Willie Dog.
[01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:17.600]  Exactly.
[01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:18.960]  Untested.
[01:39:18.960 --> 01:39:19.600]  It's tested now.
[01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:20.160]  It's fine.
[01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:21.680]  That's a beautiful plant.
[01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:24.720]  That's when I first dropped.
[01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:28.240]  And that's what like, that's what I don't get that I get it.
[01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:33.280]  People are trying to be like honorable and like, you know, but hey, dude, like as people
[01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:39.600]  go down the line, like this is going to have that that fucking big ass you on it that people
[01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:43.440]  aren't going to be so quick about popping as time goes by, you know, but, you know,
[01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:45.040]  whatever.
[01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:46.160]  That's just my two cents.
[01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:47.280]  Like, yeah, I get it.
[01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:47.760]  I get it.
[01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:50.320]  Don't be afraid.
[01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:52.400]  Yeah, don't be scared, man.
[01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:53.040]  I grew it out.
[01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:53.600]  I loved it.
[01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:54.640]  I kept it around.
[01:39:54.640 --> 01:39:56.240]  I grew that last season.
[01:39:56.240 --> 01:39:59.680]  That shit gets super fat, has a super unique nose.
[01:39:59.680 --> 01:40:03.040]  It's like a floral, you know, type of deal going on.
[01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:04.480]  Like nothing else.
[01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:08.160]  It's just a unique kind of, you know, legacy type of strain.
[01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:09.200]  It's nice to have around.
[01:40:09.200 --> 01:40:11.120]  It's kind of pure, has no cookies in it.
[01:40:11.120 --> 01:40:13.840]  You know, you'd love it, Chad.
[01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:18.560]  Am I that obvious?
[01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:20.080]  Do I not have a good poker face?
[01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:20.960]  Is that what you're telling me?
[01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:23.200]  My poker face sucks.
[01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:29.200]  Here's a couple of things from AK Bean Brands, but they're not in the regular packaging.
[01:40:29.280 --> 01:40:30.560]  He just sent me these.
[01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:39.840]  Chocolope F5, Beatrix Choice, and the M48 South African A's.
[01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:40.560]  Oh, okay.
[01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:43.360]  I have not seen or heard about that one before.
[01:40:44.560 --> 01:40:44.880]  Do you know?
[01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:46.880]  Did you get your hands on any Congolese?
[01:40:48.240 --> 01:40:49.680]  I did not, no.
[01:40:49.680 --> 01:40:54.000]  I just have some, not the older Congolese, just that Roberts Creek Congo.
[01:40:54.560 --> 01:40:56.080]  Newer, hunted out one.
[01:40:56.160 --> 01:40:58.640]  But it's not the old school Congolese.
[01:40:59.440 --> 01:41:04.960]  But this is, sorry, this is from the, I got the ones from, what's his name?
[01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:07.680]  From Nick Rizdin's auction.
[01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:10.080]  And supposedly those were from Mean Gene, the ones I got.
[01:41:11.360 --> 01:41:14.880]  Wherever those came from, if anyone knows.
[01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:15.840]  But I'm growing them.
[01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:18.240]  They're super land racy for sure.
[01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:20.240]  I got some, and they're, yeah, they're nice.
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:25.680]  Yes, I do remember that auction.
[01:41:25.680 --> 01:41:26.640]  You're 100% right.
[01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:27.600]  They were from Mean Gene.
[01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:29.040]  Yeah.
[01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:31.600]  Cool.
[01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:36.160]  Yeah, this is the later Super Sativa C Club, around like 89 or so.
[01:41:37.680 --> 01:41:42.480]  Anytime you're getting, the M's are that high, it's going to be later on at the Super Sativa C Club.
[01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:45.600]  Was that kind of like their catalog number?
[01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:46.480]  Yes.
[01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:48.640]  Okay, that's cool to know.
[01:41:48.640 --> 01:41:49.680]  Did not know that before.
[01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:54.320]  Bokashi is very vocal about him not liking the Congo.
[01:41:54.320 --> 01:41:57.520]  As soon as I got the pack, he's like, don't even pop them.
[01:41:57.520 --> 01:42:00.720]  I'm like, dude, I paid $2,000 for these.
[01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:02.160]  What do you mean don't pop them?
[01:42:02.160 --> 01:42:03.840]  He's like, I already hunted to them.
[01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:06.240]  There's no point in even fucking hunting to them.
[01:42:06.240 --> 01:42:08.240]  I'm like, that's not how I operate.
[01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:11.200]  I'm totally hunting through these, buddy.
[01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:13.600]  But he has been very vocal about it.
[01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:17.120]  I like his hunting process too.
[01:42:17.120 --> 01:42:22.560]  He's done a lot of explanations in the past of how he works, kind of the feno hunts,
[01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:26.640]  how he does the different feeding schedules, how he does a few different things to pick the winners.
[01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:27.600]  I've learned from that.
[01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:28.560]  So that's always nice.
[01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:36.000]  But yeah, some of these ones that I see, especially ones that go in some of these auctions,
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.320]  I'm like, it's an older land race.
[01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:40.320]  It might not have the sex appeal.
[01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:43.040]  And it's meant for breeding.
[01:42:43.760 --> 01:42:45.200]  I kind of want the sex appeal.
[01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:45.520]  I don't know.
[01:42:45.520 --> 01:42:49.120]  Do you have a distinction when you're buying something, Masonic or Dave?
[01:42:50.160 --> 01:42:51.920]  I'm just a fan, man.
[01:42:51.920 --> 01:42:54.400]  Of course not everything's going to be biscotti.
[01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:56.800]  Of course not everything's going to be sour diesel.
[01:42:56.800 --> 01:42:59.040]  It's just that.
[01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:01.600]  It's a tool.
[01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:03.200]  And you can use it to breed.
[01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:09.760]  You can keep it around in its pure form and have that option because options are a factor now.
[01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:15.600]  Back in the day, you had to have only the best of the best because of legality and space.
[01:43:15.680 --> 01:43:22.480]  But now if you have the resources for space and time and the law is lax where you're from,
[01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:26.960]  well, fuck, you can keep a Congo around and flower a few just for shits and giggles,
[01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:32.800]  just for the simple fact of preservation and legacy and culture and all these other things.
[01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:35.920]  And it might even get some people really ripped.
[01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:38.480]  Just things like that.
[01:43:39.200 --> 01:43:40.240]  It's all subjective.
[01:43:41.760 --> 01:43:45.280]  I don't try to box myself in with a plan.
[01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:52.320]  And our tastes change too, sometimes daily, weekly, but just big picture year over year.
[01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:56.800]  I tend to be either ahead of the times or behind the times.
[01:43:56.800 --> 01:44:01.120]  I didn't really understand a lot of the OG when it was popular.
[01:44:01.120 --> 01:44:02.880]  I was more into the fruitier stuff.
[01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:07.120]  And then as the fruitier stuff became popular, I was like, man, this OG shit's really good.
[01:44:07.680 --> 01:44:10.160]  So I'm either ahead or behind the times.
[01:44:10.160 --> 01:44:12.560]  I got introduced to OG really early.
[01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:14.480]  So I started with that.
[01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:19.840]  And I remember going to Santa Cruz and they had like Cinderella 99 and AK-47.
[01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:24.400]  And they were nice and all, but it didn't give me that narcotic high that the OG would give me
[01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:26.000]  back in the hood.
[01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.880]  And it was always like chasing the dragon.
[01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:32.400]  Being up in Santa Cruz, I was like, man, I can't wait to go back to the hood and go give me a
[01:44:32.400 --> 01:44:37.520]  little dime bag, a dub sack of some freaking OG, some gas.
[01:44:38.080 --> 01:44:40.560]  But that did happen with me.
[01:44:40.560 --> 01:44:48.080]  But as time went by and variety became a choice, fuck yeah, man, I started becoming in tune with
[01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:51.040]  the other flavors and OG kind of took the back seat.
[01:44:51.040 --> 01:44:52.960]  But it's always going to be my number one love.
[01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:53.460]  You know?
[01:44:54.400 --> 01:44:55.600]  Yeah, I get it.
[01:44:55.600 --> 01:45:00.880]  One of the ones that Dave helped me out with here is I had always talked about dog shit
[01:45:00.880 --> 01:45:04.000]  because in the Pacific Northwest in the 90s, it was around.
[01:45:04.080 --> 01:45:09.120]  And for a good year, I had talked about the dog shit or asked a lot of the breeders on this
[01:45:09.120 --> 01:45:10.320]  channel about dog shit.
[01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:12.160]  People weren't really familiar with it.
[01:45:12.160 --> 01:45:13.520]  Now it's kind of coming back.
[01:45:13.520 --> 01:45:16.560]  But I had mentioned that to Dave, I think, on the first show.
[01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:18.800]  And he's like, bro, I got you.
[01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:22.160]  So I'll be popping some of these soon.
[01:45:22.160 --> 01:45:24.480]  It's on the next run, the Hong Kong Pooey.
[01:45:24.480 --> 01:45:27.840]  So dog shit times old family purple T-1000.
[01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:31.360]  That's the Humboldt CSI FemSat.
[01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:34.320]  That's the Humboldt CSI FemSeeds.
[01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:40.720]  But yeah, that's one of those that brings me back to some of those original Terps.
[01:45:41.440 --> 01:45:42.560]  Literally smells.
[01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:43.840]  Yeah.
[01:45:44.480 --> 01:45:44.720]  Yeah.
[01:45:45.440 --> 01:45:46.320]  I love his vision.
[01:45:48.400 --> 01:45:55.280]  And that also came with a little T-1000 times Jaro and the Katsu Bubba times Jaro.
[01:45:56.480 --> 01:45:57.840]  Because I love the Bubba Kush.
[01:45:58.640 --> 01:46:02.480]  That Katsu Bubba Jaro dominates everything that it's touched so far.
[01:46:03.200 --> 01:46:04.080]  Good, good.
[01:46:04.640 --> 01:46:08.080]  Well, again, guys, this has been really freaking fun.
[01:46:08.080 --> 01:46:10.560]  I want to be respectful of your times and your nights.
[01:46:10.560 --> 01:46:12.560]  I'm going to pull out one more.
[01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:13.440]  One whammy.
[01:46:13.440 --> 01:46:17.040]  If you guys got one whammy near you, let's pull out one more.
[01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:22.560]  Probably because I've grown these out and I've been so freaking impressed with my results.
[01:46:22.560 --> 01:46:23.760]  I got to pull this one out.
[01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:25.520]  I got to pull out the Bee Leaf Cannabis.
[01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:28.160]  This one is straight fire.
[01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:33.680]  This is the Bee Leaf times Lit Watermelon Mimosa 10 times the creature.
[01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:34.880]  It's called Kool-Aid Man.
[01:46:35.920 --> 01:46:36.800]  Boom.
[01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:39.840]  That shit is straight fire.
[01:46:41.680 --> 01:46:49.520]  So that's one of my not leaving the box seed packs for anybody.
[01:46:49.520 --> 01:46:51.520]  I'm going to pull up my Instagram here, damn it.
[01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:56.320]  One of my favorite strains that I've grown recently was the
[01:46:57.440 --> 01:46:59.440]  Grow Low Key Always Be Flowering Collabs.
[01:46:59.440 --> 01:47:03.120]  They did some GB6 crosses and those were fucking out of here.
[01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:09.120]  They checked all the boxes as far as turps, growth, shine, just a little bit of everything.
[01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:10.640]  A lot of everything, actually.
[01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:12.000]  Those really kicked ass.
[01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:15.760]  And also the Piffmints from Purple City Genetics.
[01:47:15.760 --> 01:47:17.280]  Those kicked ass too.
[01:47:17.360 --> 01:47:21.920]  Those two really, really, those two, those are outliers amongst
[01:47:23.120 --> 01:47:25.200]  the copious amount of seeds that I've skimmed through.
[01:47:25.920 --> 01:47:30.880]  I'm assuming that's like Piff times Cushmints or what is that?
[01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:31.920]  I believe so.
[01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:34.480]  I believe so or Cushmints, something.
[01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:35.680]  But that one was really good.
[01:47:37.360 --> 01:47:37.860]  Okay.
[01:47:38.720 --> 01:47:41.440]  I just got to, oh, why am I even throwing it up on the Instagram?
[01:47:41.440 --> 01:47:42.960]  I got it in my shit right here.
[01:47:44.560 --> 01:47:44.960]  Right?
[01:47:44.960 --> 01:47:45.280]  Right?
[01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:45.680]  Do I?
[01:47:47.920 --> 01:47:48.240]  Okay.
[01:47:48.720 --> 01:47:51.120]  This was that Kool-Aid man that I grew.
[01:47:51.120 --> 01:47:53.760]  It was just fucking frosty as all get out.
[01:47:54.400 --> 01:47:55.840]  Had the flavor to go with it.
[01:47:56.560 --> 01:48:00.000]  It was fucking fabulous.
[01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:03.360]  Yeah, that was that Kool-Aid man.
[01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:06.080]  All right, Dave, what's your show?
[01:48:06.080 --> 01:48:06.960]  What's your closer?
[01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:12.640]  The two favorites that I've grown recently would be the Space Fuel from Katsu,
[01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:14.480]  the East Coast Sour Diesel Romulan.
[01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:16.240]  I grew that too.
[01:48:16.960 --> 01:48:18.080]  That sounds strong.
[01:48:18.080 --> 01:48:18.560]  Loved it.
[01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:20.320]  I grew that too.
[01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:22.080]  That was a nice one.
[01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:23.440]  That was a nice one.
[01:48:23.440 --> 01:48:28.240]  And then some dude already brought me back the Wilson hybrid of that the other day.
[01:48:28.240 --> 01:48:31.440]  And I got, it's a nice one.
[01:48:31.440 --> 01:48:33.120]  I can see why you get privy with that.
[01:48:33.120 --> 01:48:34.880]  It has a nice turk.
[01:48:34.880 --> 01:48:36.320]  For sure has a nice turk.
[01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:39.840]  It's just a old school 90s weed.
[01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:41.840]  The other one I really liked, I talked about it earlier,
[01:48:41.840 --> 01:48:44.000]  was that Runch Gelato 33 Cherry Honey.
[01:48:44.720 --> 01:48:45.840]  Just a fucking banger.
[01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:49.280]  I'm not big on the Runch all the time, but something different.
[01:48:49.280 --> 01:48:51.040]  He's big on Runch.
[01:48:55.920 --> 01:48:56.800]  If it's good, it's good.
[01:48:56.800 --> 01:48:57.600]  I don't discriminate.
[01:48:57.600 --> 01:48:58.400]  If it's good, it's good.
[01:48:58.960 --> 01:48:59.360]  Why not?
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:01.360]  A variety is the spice of life.
[01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:05.760]  Mean Gene got you hooked on the Runch now.
[01:49:05.760 --> 01:49:06.320]  Just kidding.
[01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:11.440]  What I really need to get into is I had it up here earlier,
[01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:17.600]  that the Bodie Mean Gene collab, the Permacool Record, Gelato 33 Cherry Limeade.
[01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:19.760]  That's going to be a banger.
[01:49:20.480 --> 01:49:21.920]  That sounds wicked, man.
[01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:24.240]  Sounds wicked.
[01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:26.880]  Well, shit, guys.
[01:49:26.880 --> 01:49:28.560]  Thank you for sharing your collections.
[01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:30.160]  Thank you for having me, man.
[01:49:30.160 --> 01:49:31.760]  I appreciate both of you guys.
[01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:33.200]  Yeah, thanks for pushing it.
[01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:34.480]  Chat, thanks for hanging out.
[01:49:34.480 --> 01:49:37.200]  Thanks for playing along and thanks for being cool above all.
[01:49:37.200 --> 01:49:40.720]  So hell yeah, guys, we will do this again.
[01:49:41.680 --> 01:49:44.560]  Hopefully, volume seven, Bokashi Earthworks.
[01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:45.520]  I'll hit you up, man.
[01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:48.320]  That'll be good times.
[01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:48.800]  Good times.
[01:49:48.800 --> 01:49:49.200]  Let's see.
[01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:52.240]  Dave may or may not be the Jack in the Box guy.
[01:49:52.240 --> 01:49:54.960]  Ooh, Dave, can you confirm or deny?
[01:49:56.640 --> 01:49:59.600]  I cannot confirm or deny anything.
[01:50:00.240 --> 01:50:01.280]  That's why you don't see me.
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:04.480]  All right.
[01:50:05.040 --> 01:50:05.920]  All right.
[01:50:05.920 --> 01:50:09.920]  We all know the American one has been Diesel and now the rumor is forever started that
[01:50:09.920 --> 01:50:11.280]  you're the Jack in the Box guys.
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:15.360]  So with that, we'll end the show.
[01:50:15.360 --> 01:50:16.800]  Dave's the Jack in the Box guy.
[01:50:16.800 --> 01:50:17.840]  Everybody, repeat it.
