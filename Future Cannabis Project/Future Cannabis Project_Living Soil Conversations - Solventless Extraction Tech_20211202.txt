[00:00.000 --> 00:12.880]  I mean, she draws all the time, so it's kind of whenever, uh, like she, she, she had to
[00:12.880 --> 00:17.820]  sit at my desk last night and do her Chinese zoom tutor.
[00:17.820 --> 00:21.460]  And so she just does anything but the tutoring.
[00:21.460 --> 00:29.120]  So she was drawing while she was, uh, talking to you, but anyway, we are live.
[00:29.120 --> 00:30.120]  Welcome everyone.
[00:30.120 --> 00:32.120]  Uh, take it away, Brian.
[00:32.120 --> 00:33.120]  Yeah.
[00:33.120 --> 00:34.120]  Good morning to you living soil nerds.
[00:34.120 --> 00:38.400]  Uh, this is an exciting day for a lot of us, uh, especially behind the scenes.
[00:38.400 --> 00:42.360]  I just wanted to take a moment, uh, for a lot of you out there that was at Indow Expo
[00:42.360 --> 00:43.360]  in 2020.
[00:43.360 --> 00:46.360]  Uh, we got to see a gentleman named Duke diamond.
[00:46.360 --> 00:49.920]  Uh, and then after that Expo, we didn't see that gentleman for a long time.
[00:49.920 --> 00:55.600]  And a lot of people were saying things that were, uh, some were true, some were not true.
[00:56.120 --> 01:00.040]  But the real beauty of it is, and I wanted to like give a real quick shout out is that,
[01:00.040 --> 01:03.200]  uh, as of this morning, Duke diamond is out of prison.
[01:03.200 --> 01:05.960]  Uh, he's going to be back into the community.
[01:05.960 --> 01:08.200]  So you're going to see him popping off here soon.
[01:08.200 --> 01:12.200]  He's going to be doing a lot of things behind the scenes that I will let him explain.
[01:12.200 --> 01:16.920]  Uh, but we're just really excited to have, I feel like, you know, your breeders favorite
[01:16.920 --> 01:21.280]  breeder out there, uh, for a lot of us in the industry is definitely Duke diamond.
[01:21.280 --> 01:25.960]  So we're just excited to have him back, uh, live and well, and, and doing, uh, what he
[01:25.960 --> 01:29.200]  needs to do to get back, uh, on that saddle again.
[01:29.200 --> 01:34.040]  So, uh, for all of you that were wondering, um, Mr. Duke diamond is officially out of
[01:34.040 --> 01:35.040]  prison.
[01:35.040 --> 01:36.040]  Awesome.
[01:36.040 --> 01:37.040]  All right.
[01:37.040 --> 01:38.040]  So I wanted to kick off this show.
[01:38.040 --> 01:43.280]  Obviously we got, uh, you know, the extraction Zeus Weiser, a gentleman by a bunch of aliases.
[01:43.280 --> 01:46.960]  I feel like that's how a lot of us used to go so that nobody really knew what was going
[01:46.960 --> 01:48.360]  on with, with your name.
[01:48.480 --> 01:52.160]  Uh, but they do always kind of recognize you, you know, your presence and the things that
[01:52.160 --> 01:53.160]  you're putting out there.
[01:53.160 --> 01:55.400]  And I feel like this is a special show for that reason.
[01:55.400 --> 01:59.560]  Uh, we're going to kind of go behind the scenes and show a lot of the, uh, dog and pony kind
[01:59.560 --> 02:03.920]  of things that the live Q and a, uh, I feel like the things that, uh, the viewers get
[02:03.920 --> 02:08.400]  the most out of that are a lot newer to this, uh, because they actually get to see it in
[02:08.400 --> 02:09.720]  real time and action.
[02:09.720 --> 02:13.520]  And then there's going to be a few other experts that we're going to pop up on the show, uh,
[02:13.520 --> 02:16.100]  that can kind of talk on this, obviously on a deeper level.
[02:16.100 --> 02:21.740]  So we're excited to bring on, uh, obviously, uh, Weiser, but also have a few other people
[02:21.740 --> 02:23.580]  on here to kind of show the progression.
[02:23.580 --> 02:28.220]  Uh, Weiser and I have been talking back and forth this week, uh, and he's, he's been really
[02:28.220 --> 02:31.200]  candid with me saying, you know, there's a lot of things that he's been learning just
[02:31.200 --> 02:34.220]  from the show that we've been putting on a future cannabis project.
[02:34.220 --> 02:38.380]  Uh, so this is the, the real beauty of this is that, you know, this show is going to kind
[02:38.380 --> 02:41.140]  of show things full circle, uh, what you can really do.
[02:41.140 --> 02:45.180]  I feel like a lot of people underestimate what they can achieve in a year.
[02:45.300 --> 02:49.580]  Uh, so there's a lot of things that I feel like, um, Weiser's going to talk about that.
[02:49.580 --> 02:53.900]  He's been able to achieve and a lot of milestones that are going to be made today, uh, with
[02:53.900 --> 02:56.220]  kind of your progress and your education Weiser.
[02:56.220 --> 03:01.620]  So I wanted to also give it out to my co-host Layton, uh, who kind of, uh, was talking to
[03:01.620 --> 03:03.220]  this gentleman behind the scenes as well.
[03:03.220 --> 03:07.460]  So, you know, again, it's, it's really exciting for us to be able to show people that are
[03:07.460 --> 03:11.700]  taking information and running with it and then really running with it and excelling at
[03:11.700 --> 03:12.200]  it.
[03:12.200 --> 03:14.780]  Uh, so again, shout out to, uh, to Peter as well.
[03:14.780 --> 03:19.260]  Future Cannabis Project, always allowing us to continue this free education platform
[03:19.260 --> 03:22.180]  that has just taken off, uh, dramatically in a way.
[03:22.180 --> 03:24.180]  I mean, there's so many people reaching out now.
[03:24.180 --> 03:27.500]  There's so much content that's going out, uh, that we hope that there's going to be
[03:27.500 --> 03:32.060]  more, uh, Weiser's out there in the future that just continue to, uh, run with, uh, what
[03:32.060 --> 03:32.980]  they continue to learn.
[03:35.300 --> 03:36.820]  Man, I'm so glad to be here.
[03:36.820 --> 03:38.980]  I've been watching you guys since inception.
[03:39.220 --> 03:46.100]  And, uh, I will tell you that this is the one year anniversary of, uh, me having both
[03:46.100 --> 03:48.500]  my right and my left shoulder done.
[03:49.940 --> 03:51.100]  Right one wasn't that bad.
[03:51.100 --> 03:55.700]  The left one was really jacked up, but this is when I found you guys is when I was
[03:55.740 --> 04:04.380]  injured and in my worst times, uh, the trail goes from me literally just, we'll get
[04:04.380 --> 04:05.940]  into all that, but sick of solvents.
[04:05.940 --> 04:11.220]  I found Frenchie first, and I think those videos were produced by Peter and, uh,
[04:11.780 --> 04:16.460]  found Peter right when he was doing the solventless projects, the solventless
[04:16.460 --> 04:17.740]  conversation projects.
[04:17.740 --> 04:21.060]  I don't know if those are still ongoing, but I think like you said, as things
[04:21.060 --> 04:26.500]  progress, there's so much information and I've learned so much that you almost miss
[04:26.500 --> 04:31.220]  steps of stuff that you wanted to remember, but you can't because there's so much more
[04:31.220 --> 04:32.740]  new information that you're learning.
[04:33.380 --> 04:34.940]  And a shout out to you guys.
[04:34.980 --> 04:39.500]  I mean, Peter, you, Brian Layton, Layton for sure putting up with my ass the last
[04:39.500 --> 04:40.180]  three months.
[04:40.900 --> 04:46.620]  Uh, you know, it's, it's, it's one thing to have you guys on a show and it's another
[04:46.620 --> 04:48.380]  thing to have you guys reach back.
[04:48.900 --> 04:49.980]  Bird just popping up.
[04:50.020 --> 04:51.300]  I mean, bird, what the fuck?
[04:52.300 --> 04:54.980]  Congratulations on your new trophy.
[04:55.020 --> 05:00.700]  And I gotta say just she Instagram this man and have this man give me his direct
[05:00.700 --> 05:04.060]  cell number and say, yes, I will talk to you about what you're doing.
[05:04.620 --> 05:06.300]  And tell me if I'm crazy or not.
[05:06.300 --> 05:07.460]  That's the first thing I asked.
[05:08.020 --> 05:13.860]  So when you get into the progression of finding everyone in a row, it's a lot, it's
[05:13.860 --> 05:18.580]  really a lot for somebody for me to absorb, but thank you guys so much for that.
[05:18.620 --> 05:24.020]  And, uh, there's so many other things we'll talk about as that moves on, but I
[05:24.020 --> 05:27.340]  think the history here is, is needed as far as myself.
[05:28.860 --> 05:32.660]  I come from a really tainted background at two years old in diapers.
[05:32.700 --> 05:39.220]  I remember and in the joints to my mother from my father, uh, second grade, we moved
[05:39.380 --> 05:47.900]  off grid to run very illegal operations that are very, just not good for you.
[05:48.180 --> 05:53.580]  And it's also this time that someone took me in and the gentleman's passed away.
[05:53.580 --> 05:54.780]  His name was Mike Boyd.
[05:55.660 --> 05:57.860]  He looked like the lead singer for the Bee Gees.
[05:58.100 --> 06:02.700]  And he came up and stayed us with us at this farm and brought a full taco, 400
[06:02.700 --> 06:06.980]  motorcycle and started riding all these fields in the middle of Wisconsin.
[06:07.780 --> 06:12.700]  And brought kind of brought me under his wing to get me away from my parents and
[06:12.700 --> 06:17.780]  what was happening, and he introduced me to the world of cannabis, not that I was
[06:17.780 --> 06:22.220]  consuming it, but instead of running a track line, he showed me how to harvest
[06:23.060 --> 06:28.580]  and how to make hash balls and hashish to sell to the bikers that were coming to see
[06:28.580 --> 06:29.140]  my parents.
[06:29.860 --> 06:36.140]  And I know that's pretty progressive, but again, right here, it's the truth.
[06:36.740 --> 06:37.580]  That's where I come from.
[06:38.180 --> 06:43.580]  And to come back down to across the border in Illinois, and you can just deal
[06:43.580 --> 06:44.860]  with a whole different world.
[06:45.540 --> 06:51.380]  Uh, by the time I was in fifth grade, the same cardboard barrels full of, of
[06:51.620 --> 06:56.780]  material, I was still hashing out, selling hash balls out my window to a gentleman
[06:56.780 --> 06:59.820]  that would eventually come my nephew's stepdaughter.
[07:00.340 --> 07:02.780]  So it's 30, 40 years of history.
[07:03.620 --> 07:08.540]  So where, you know, you get into high school, the eighties, late eighties,
[07:09.460 --> 07:16.500]  uh, everything's Brown weed, you know, connections, you're running shit.
[07:17.300 --> 07:20.180]  And eventually we got hooked up with people in Arizona.
[07:21.500 --> 07:23.260]  We started moving it on airplanes.
[07:25.500 --> 07:26.140]  Always.
[07:26.460 --> 07:27.980]  I wanted the bottom of the bag.
[07:28.060 --> 07:29.580]  Everybody take the big ball.
[07:29.740 --> 07:31.380]  Why do I want the bottom of the bag?
[07:31.380 --> 07:32.740]  Layton what's in it?
[07:33.660 --> 07:34.740]  Jack homes.
[07:34.780 --> 07:35.060]  Yeah.
[07:36.700 --> 07:39.540]  So I'm, I'm pressing what I need to get through.
[07:39.540 --> 07:43.140]  And you know, at this time you're I'm 19, 20 years old.
[07:43.140 --> 07:45.780]  You're you're a single guy you're out there.
[07:45.780 --> 07:48.460]  And like I was telling Brian, you're in a world that.
[07:50.460 --> 07:53.020]  Trying to make ends meet on a black market, basically.
[07:54.420 --> 08:02.980]  So this culminates into I'm not a woman, a woman with a long distance relationship.
[08:02.980 --> 08:04.660]  And I changed my life.
[08:04.660 --> 08:05.900]  It truly changed my life.
[08:05.900 --> 08:07.740]  And that was, in my opinion, a good thing.
[08:08.460 --> 08:11.060]  Uh, I wouldn't have my, my offspring without it.
[08:11.140 --> 08:12.660]  And you learn a lot.
[08:12.740 --> 08:15.340]  We're no longer together, but throughout that whole period,
[08:15.780 --> 08:17.420]  it was something that was taboo.
[08:17.820 --> 08:19.100]  Thank you, president Bush.
[08:19.580 --> 08:25.300]  Uh, thank you all the, uh, say no to drugs people where in reality, this is the drug
[08:25.300 --> 08:26.700]  that should have been taken the whole time.
[08:27.660 --> 08:32.340]  Uh, my ex wife is also a caregiver and a nurse.
[08:32.980 --> 08:36.940]  So you listen to her and you start taking drugs like.
[08:37.420 --> 08:38.140]  What effects are.
[08:39.020 --> 08:39.620]  Klonopin.
[08:41.620 --> 08:47.820]  Other head drugs to, in my opinion and definition, dumb you down to stay
[08:47.860 --> 08:49.660]  in your lifestyle that you're in.
[08:51.500 --> 08:53.300]  And I've obviously I did it.
[08:53.340 --> 08:56.260]  You're still consuming cannabis through that point, but you're listening to
[08:56.260 --> 08:57.820]  others around you who you trust.
[08:58.300 --> 09:01.780]  And, uh, it was just a bad thing for me.
[09:03.860 --> 09:10.820]  Eventually I learned that I had a gluten allergy, but 17 years ago, I
[09:10.820 --> 09:11.540]  don't know if Mr.
[09:11.540 --> 09:14.020]  Toad's watching, but Mr.
[09:14.020 --> 09:18.380]  Toad, I was caught from the bottom of my scrotum through my anus into my left
[09:18.620 --> 09:21.580]  butt cheek and left down on my face for dead.
[09:22.980 --> 09:28.500]  It took me 12 years of walking with a limp before I decided to change that.
[09:29.340 --> 09:33.260]  And through some physical therapy and other means and treatment correctly of
[09:33.260 --> 09:37.940]  cannabis, I was able to run a mile about a year and a half ago.
[09:37.940 --> 09:41.420]  I haven't done that because of the shoulder things, but again, cannabis
[09:41.420 --> 09:47.380]  carrying you through keeping your head straight, I've been addicted to opiates
[09:47.420 --> 09:51.940]  several times to those surgeries and taking myself off of them with products.
[09:51.940 --> 09:55.700]  I'm about to show you how I know how to make back in the day.
[09:56.540 --> 09:58.260]  And, you know, extraction is great.
[09:58.940 --> 10:05.060]  New toys, everything that we're doing, everything that is so advanced, but it's
[10:05.060 --> 10:06.620]  not full spectrum of the plant.
[10:07.180 --> 10:07.860]  It's just not.
[10:08.540 --> 10:14.340]  And an outdoor grow and a greenhouse grow and an indoor grow.
[10:14.380 --> 10:15.860]  They're all going to give you medicine.
[10:15.860 --> 10:19.580]  It's just a matter of what level of medicine you need and what level of
[10:19.580 --> 10:22.020]  medicine that you, you can get into your life.
[10:22.060 --> 10:23.940]  There's a reason I'm sitting in this chair.
[10:25.620 --> 10:28.220]  My brother also lost his legs to Guillain-Barre.
[10:28.220 --> 10:34.020]  We don't speak, but I'm kind of sitting in this chair and I'd have all this set
[10:34.020 --> 10:35.620]  up for people who are like Mr.
[10:35.620 --> 10:39.860]  Toad and are like my brother that possibly need this medication, but
[10:39.940 --> 10:41.580]  don't have the ability to do it.
[10:41.940 --> 10:47.140]  But I assure you everything here, most of it you can do from a wheelchair.
[10:48.100 --> 10:51.260]  And your program is the one that helps people.
[10:51.260 --> 10:54.540]  It certainly helps everybody in the industry to advance in what they're
[10:54.540 --> 10:56.180]  doing and produce better medicine.
[10:56.820 --> 11:00.020]  A huge fan, Steve Cantwell, huge fan.
[11:01.140 --> 11:01.980]  He's got the way.
[11:02.860 --> 11:08.060]  And, you know, it's just so much that I can comment on to get to that point.
[11:08.220 --> 11:13.660]  But when you suffer so much and you go through so much pain, there has got to be
[11:13.660 --> 11:18.700]  something that brings you out of it instead of fucking big pharma straight up.
[11:19.060 --> 11:22.500]  And sometimes you need that with major surgeries, but you got to come
[11:22.500 --> 11:24.060]  out of it and cannabis does that.
[11:24.860 --> 11:29.420]  Unfortunately, dispensaries don't run that route.
[11:29.900 --> 11:31.060]  They don't treat you that way.
[11:31.340 --> 11:34.580]  And some of them know right now, a manager of one of those
[11:34.580 --> 11:36.060]  dispensaries should be watching.
[11:37.900 --> 11:42.220]  And I'll tell you straight out, Sean, to have medical books that say treat
[11:42.300 --> 11:48.900]  people with medical marijuana and never have any solventless products on your shelf.
[11:50.180 --> 11:50.980]  You're killing people.
[11:52.220 --> 11:54.020]  I've been addicted to these solvents.
[11:54.260 --> 11:56.140]  I've also taken myself off of them.
[11:57.220 --> 12:02.940]  Any solvent extraction, in my opinion, that you are inhaling is an addiction.
[12:04.980 --> 12:06.940]  I had one of those alcohol reclaimers.
[12:06.940 --> 12:10.860]  I'm not going to say the name, but right on the gentleman's website, he promotes
[12:10.860 --> 12:15.300]  people to vape leftover alcohol in their concentrate in the cartridge.
[12:15.580 --> 12:17.020]  How dare you do that to people?
[12:17.540 --> 12:18.780]  How dare you say that to people?
[12:19.780 --> 12:21.900]  So one day you'll be paid back for that.
[12:22.060 --> 12:26.140]  And that's the only bad thing I have to say about the industry is when people
[12:26.140 --> 12:29.900]  educate people the wrong way, how dare you do that?
[12:30.780 --> 12:35.580]  So that's enough of my medical shit and a rant as far as that goes.
[12:36.460 --> 12:39.060]  Like to get some feedback from you guys on those statements.
[12:41.700 --> 12:46.700]  Well, first of all, I'd love to open up and say how much I enjoyed
[12:46.700 --> 12:48.620]  your Temple ball you sent me.
[12:49.060 --> 12:50.260]  And continue to enjoy it.
[12:51.100 --> 12:53.540]  Your work is clearly there.
[12:53.580 --> 12:59.460]  And as far as educating people to what's available, yeah, there's a lot of work
[12:59.460 --> 13:04.740]  left to do. Any dispenser you go into, they don't even know what regenerative
[13:04.740 --> 13:06.740]  cannabis is or organic cannabis is.
[13:07.020 --> 13:07.740]  They don't get it.
[13:08.300 --> 13:12.660]  And then you've got these companies like Flow Cannon fucking over the farms up
[13:12.660 --> 13:18.620]  north that are making real, real high quality medicine.
[13:19.260 --> 13:21.020]  And cannabis and it's a shame.
[13:21.940 --> 13:25.340]  So, yeah, we have we have a lot of work left to do.
[13:25.340 --> 13:32.180]  But platforms like this and will continue to open people's eyes and allow them to
[13:32.180 --> 13:39.420]  ask the question to a point where the demand becomes unstoppable.
[13:39.900 --> 13:41.420]  Because right now there's no demand.
[13:41.420 --> 13:46.620]  So therefore, these companies like Flow Cannon have got everybody by the
[13:46.620 --> 13:48.260]  shorthairs and it's sad.
[13:49.100 --> 13:52.740]  So, yeah, again, a lot of work left to do.
[13:52.740 --> 13:57.220]  And, you know, we'll continue to plow ahead with with platforms like this to get
[13:57.220 --> 14:00.980]  the word out so that people start requesting it and they vote with their dollars
[14:00.980 --> 14:01.980]  instead of their mouth.
[14:03.180 --> 14:05.060]  I don't know, Brian, did you want to jump in on that?
[14:06.060 --> 14:08.820]  Well, I just want to give a tip of the hat to Bird coming on as well.
[14:09.180 --> 14:10.780]  He's been sitting there quietly and everything.
[14:10.780 --> 14:13.300]  So Bird, appreciate you coming in on the conversation, brother.
[14:13.900 --> 14:19.620]  But the main thing I feel like with our extraction juice that that I'm excited about,
[14:19.820 --> 14:26.980]  Mr. Weiser over there, is that he's kind of YouTube for me was how I learned a lot
[14:26.980 --> 14:30.100]  of the things that I felt like I started to share and then things started to build off.
[14:30.100 --> 14:34.060]  And then I feel like YouTube is now taking another level since covid and all of that
[14:34.060 --> 14:38.340]  kind of stuff. So I feel like YouTube is the platform.
[14:38.340 --> 14:41.860]  And if you're using it correctly, where you could really begin to change your life in
[14:41.900 --> 14:43.980]  a year or two and have a real skill set.
[14:43.980 --> 14:48.460]  I mean, you could take a class, you know, once things pop off, you can take a class
[14:48.460 --> 14:53.380]  from Bird and really start to take your knowledge and your skill sets to the next
[14:53.380 --> 14:57.820]  level so that you could eventually get a job at a commercial facility.
[14:58.060 --> 15:01.380]  And I feel like Weiser is an example of this.
[15:01.380 --> 15:05.580]  Like you can just take a few little bit of information and then get the experience by
[15:05.580 --> 15:07.420]  just doing certain things, failing.
[15:07.420 --> 15:09.220]  That was something that we were talking about all week.
[15:09.460 --> 15:16.420]  Weiser is just the the gut wrenching feeling when you fuck up a squish or you just, you
[15:16.420 --> 15:19.740]  know, maybe you're not curing it right at the end where you've done everything else
[15:19.740 --> 15:23.580]  correctly and maybe you just didn't have that last little bit to make it where you feel
[15:23.580 --> 15:27.020]  like it's it's work that you want to claim is work that you want to show off.
[15:27.020 --> 15:31.540]  And especially when you're getting to to Bird's level, you know, that that canvas is
[15:32.300 --> 15:36.060]  pretty much it's not all of it, but I would say it's more than half Bird.
[15:36.060 --> 15:41.380]  I don't know, maybe even 75 percent of, you know, you're taking the work of somebody that
[15:41.380 --> 15:42.580]  that cultivated that flower.
[15:42.580 --> 15:46.860]  You're putting your expertise and artwork onto it and then really bringing out that
[15:47.180 --> 15:49.100]  that color and that expression.
[15:49.940 --> 15:52.500]  So, yeah, Bird, I wanted to kind of toss it to you.
[15:52.500 --> 15:56.460]  So, I mean, you're definitely the one that knows the most of the four of us here on this.
[15:56.460 --> 16:00.700]  And I do feel like it's it's a medicinal where Weiser is getting at.
[16:00.700 --> 16:06.060]  And if you look at it that way, then I feel like the whole point of this platform is to
[16:06.060 --> 16:10.900]  really show you that you can grow cannabis, you can grow food, you can grow pretty flowers
[16:10.900 --> 16:14.700]  for yourself by just kind of understanding certain concepts and then run with it.
[16:15.700 --> 16:17.140]  Yeah, most definitely.
[16:18.540 --> 16:25.140]  I feel like you guys said, you know, we we we vote with our dollars and and and how we
[16:25.900 --> 16:32.580]  how we purchase our stuff from the cannabis dispensaries is going to be what the people are
[16:32.580 --> 16:37.300]  going to make. But I say that education is what we can get to do that.
[16:37.300 --> 16:42.300]  You know, like you said, these platforms are a way to get it out there to the people in the
[16:42.300 --> 16:45.540]  masses with this COVID change really make YouTube.
[16:46.060 --> 16:51.460]  It's really a large platform for us to be able to speak to a lot of people and and put
[16:51.460 --> 16:53.780]  things in people's ears that they just didn't really even know.
[16:53.780 --> 16:55.060]  People don't know a lot of things.
[16:55.060 --> 16:59.620]  People don't know that that when they get a cartridge that says BHL on it, that it's made
[16:59.620 --> 17:01.940]  of butane. They just don't even know.
[17:02.020 --> 17:07.380]  And so getting the education out to people and teaching people that there is a way to do
[17:07.380 --> 17:09.340]  this better, just like our food.
[17:09.620 --> 17:12.780]  You know, we ask for organic food and we get in our grocery stores.
[17:13.180 --> 17:17.660]  We ask for organic hash and we'll get it in our dispensaries.
[17:17.660 --> 17:19.140]  It's the same exact way.
[17:19.580 --> 17:25.140]  Here's the thing, Bert, is is my dispensary has one product called Jenny Kush from Arise
[17:25.140 --> 17:31.620]  or Aries. OK, and it says on the box, I sent this video to Leighton, it says on the box.
[17:32.820 --> 17:38.140]  Solventless product and you rotate the box and it says CO2 extracted.
[17:39.460 --> 17:40.660]  What are you what are you doing?
[17:41.820 --> 17:42.860]  What am I smoking?
[17:42.860 --> 17:43.740]  What am I buying?
[17:44.060 --> 17:45.180]  Yeah, exactly.
[17:45.220 --> 17:46.780]  I mean, at least they're labeling it.
[17:46.780 --> 17:54.860]  And I will say is is rewinding all the way back.
[17:54.860 --> 17:58.020]  I mean, as as you guys know, I mean, it's it's whole plant.
[17:58.060 --> 18:04.060]  OK, so something I'm going to show you is I actually bake things with sifted flour made
[18:04.060 --> 18:05.140]  from shade leaves.
[18:05.540 --> 18:10.900]  So instead of using them for compost, full spectrum, it goes in baked products.
[18:11.900 --> 18:13.220]  Real easy to make.
[18:13.540 --> 18:19.020]  I'll show you a sifter later that I'm turning into a hash sifter that's a literal chef's
[18:19.300 --> 18:21.820]  sifter. OK, and.
[18:23.900 --> 18:26.060]  Coming from extraction.
[18:27.500 --> 18:33.660]  You make Temple balls, you know, the way we took a milk bowl from the farm, took a
[18:34.340 --> 18:39.500]  military bed sheet, which is, I don't know, maybe 200 micron.
[18:40.500 --> 18:42.380]  This quality wasn't coming out of it.
[18:42.820 --> 18:44.700]  We beat it just like the Afghans would.
[18:44.700 --> 18:48.620]  I didn't know all this until I watched it on a YouTube video later, what I was doing as
[18:48.620 --> 18:54.620]  an infant. We would then start a fire, put it out, put the milk bowl upside down on it.
[18:54.620 --> 18:59.100]  And this is where Mike would sit there and flip hash and make hash patties right in front
[18:59.100 --> 19:00.100]  of me. I didn't touch it.
[19:00.100 --> 19:02.260]  He would do it. You'd roll them up into a ball.
[19:02.260 --> 19:08.500]  It's done. Now, the way Frenchie taught me on YouTube, you know, you're looking into,
[19:08.700 --> 19:14.500]  OK, how can I get from making a hemp hash ball that's like this?
[19:14.620 --> 19:18.420]  And this is a this is a hemp hash ball, you guys.
[19:18.780 --> 19:22.660]  This is from hemp that's in the area that I wild crafted.
[19:22.940 --> 19:26.500]  And it doesn't have real good trichomes in it, OK?
[19:29.380 --> 19:30.500]  It breaks apart.
[19:31.700 --> 19:34.780]  There's nothing in it that's sticky, but you know what?
[19:35.500 --> 19:40.260]  That is some awesome medicine that puts me to sleep when I put it in a recipe.
[19:40.700 --> 19:44.340]  So there is product that's in this hemp that's around here.
[19:44.860 --> 19:46.460]  It's been around here for years.
[19:46.460 --> 19:51.620]  And I just wanted to show you that because even though it's not quality, it is medicine.
[19:51.620 --> 19:52.660]  You're not going to smoke it.
[19:52.660 --> 19:55.780]  You're going to eat it and you're going to feel the inflammation cutting and you're going
[19:55.780 --> 20:00.060]  to feel the difference. So a lot of people that overlook hemp when they're looking for
[20:00.060 --> 20:03.820]  large terpenes and THC, I notice a difference in it.
[20:04.780 --> 20:09.420]  And here's a cross of it that's been running out there about four or five years.
[20:11.020 --> 20:15.580]  This is Skywalker OG crossed with hemp.
[20:17.100 --> 20:19.900]  OK, we can see the node spacing in it.
[20:20.340 --> 20:22.500]  You can see that it's so distanced.
[20:22.820 --> 20:25.220]  Let me switch to the phone. And the buds itself.
[20:25.220 --> 20:28.060]  No, the buds itself are so loose.
[20:28.340 --> 20:34.500]  Heard. This is what you're looking for when you're looking for a cultivar to have dry
[20:34.500 --> 20:41.420]  sift. Or water hash be done, it should break apart, it shouldn't be completely loose.
[20:42.100 --> 20:48.500]  But when I saw solventless conversations with pure pressure, they have a list, they have
[20:48.500 --> 20:53.180]  a list of all the strains that they like and they've done the research.
[20:54.220 --> 21:00.620]  So when I did that research, I went to a place in Michigan, I believe it's in Ann Arbor
[21:00.620 --> 21:02.660]  for Jackson, the seed bank.
[21:02.660 --> 21:03.940]  Shout out. Nice place.
[21:03.940 --> 21:05.340]  They have a lot of genetics there.
[21:05.620 --> 21:11.140]  So you guys have this big list of pure pressure stuff and cookies and camera on there.
[21:11.260 --> 21:12.780]  So what did they have?
[21:12.780 --> 21:14.260]  They had some cookies and camp.
[21:14.260 --> 21:15.220]  And I'm going to show you this.
[21:16.540 --> 21:20.300]  The reason why I choose to wash chem instead of cookies is.
[21:21.660 --> 21:24.060]  Elevate gorilla cookies, it's solid.
[21:25.180 --> 21:29.740]  It's bulky, it's got some stiffness to it, it's not going to break apart real easy, this
[21:29.740 --> 21:33.340]  might wash with water easier and I have washed it with water.
[21:34.100 --> 21:41.500]  But I choose to run a looser chemo and I've never really seen anybody talk about this.
[21:41.500 --> 21:42.980]  They just show it.
[21:42.980 --> 21:43.900]  They just talk about it.
[21:44.540 --> 21:48.220]  So if you have this bud, you see how loose it is.
[21:49.020 --> 21:56.700]  This stuff cures in 60 days, OK, dries in five days in 70 percent humidity.
[21:59.020 --> 22:02.300]  And literally just falls apart when you touch it.
[22:03.300 --> 22:08.140]  That's what I want to be dry sifting, and this is probably why Bird washes chem and
[22:08.140 --> 22:15.300]  all those loose stuff, loose strains at first is because it produces, let alone the
[22:15.300 --> 22:18.220]  smell and what chem brings you.
[22:18.340 --> 22:23.420]  But it washes much better than, say, Skywalker, which is a complete failure because
[22:23.420 --> 22:26.300]  the buds are too tight to extract the trichomes out of.
[22:26.900 --> 22:31.940]  This is what I'm having success with as far as dry sift is chem 4-OG.
[22:31.940 --> 22:39.100]  It produces six grams on my first tumble and Gorilla Cookies produces about four.
[22:40.100 --> 22:46.380]  After that, I take it and that's just me taking it frozen, taking it in a bag just like
[22:46.380 --> 22:48.940]  this and crunching it up.
[22:48.980 --> 22:52.060]  I'm not going to do too much in this right now to show you that because I want it
[22:52.060 --> 22:54.220]  frozen. I don't want it sticking to the bag.
[22:55.220 --> 22:59.380]  On the second extraction, after I get, I don't know, six grams out of it.
[23:02.600 --> 23:09.800]  One press of a nut grinder and I know it's a mechanical separation and you can see it
[23:09.800 --> 23:16.200]  and you get some green material in it, but it's worth it because I'm getting about
[23:16.720 --> 23:18.520]  eight grams out of an ounce, Bird.
[23:19.240 --> 23:20.800]  What do you get on a wash out of chem?
[23:21.800 --> 23:24.880]  You know, strains are all different.
[23:24.960 --> 23:28.680]  I don't really have a number that I get on like a chem or anything like that.
[23:29.840 --> 23:31.920]  But is that an average compared to washing?
[23:33.080 --> 23:37.000]  When I wash, I run multiple machines at one time, too.
[23:37.240 --> 23:39.760]  And so.
[23:40.840 --> 23:44.080]  I'm looking for a larger number than that, but.
[23:44.080 --> 23:53.240]  I'm. Sometimes I'll get strains that dump, you know, a quarter of or a fifth or a
[23:53.240 --> 23:59.360]  tenth of what other ones do, and I really just try to honor all of them and find ways
[23:59.360 --> 24:04.640]  to utilize them for their medicine and present them in their best light, even though
[24:04.640 --> 24:06.120]  they're not the best producers.
[24:07.000 --> 24:13.320]  When when I get something, I always try to focus on just what what can I do to make it
[24:13.320 --> 24:19.160]  the best, not not really compare everything to yields and concern myself with with all
[24:19.160 --> 24:23.800]  of that. I'm more focused on making the best thing I can.
[24:24.280 --> 24:29.080]  And obviously I'm doing that, too, but in my state of Illinois.
[24:30.560 --> 24:34.360]  We have five plants, brother, five under a medical card.
[24:36.200 --> 24:40.240]  They can be pretty big, they can be as big as you want, and finally they change the law
[24:40.240 --> 24:43.440]  so you can actually possess more in your home.
[24:44.120 --> 24:47.360]  At first, they'd allow you to buy two and a half ounces of dispenser.
[24:47.360 --> 24:49.280]  You can only grow two and a half ounces a month.
[24:50.000 --> 24:51.880]  What the hell am I going to do with two and a half ounces a month?
[24:52.360 --> 24:57.640]  You know what I'm saying? So when I extract 20 grams, what I'm about to show you, man,
[24:57.640 --> 25:00.960]  that's like you extracted a quarter of a pound.
[25:01.040 --> 25:04.600]  It's it's it's everything to me, every grain.
[25:04.600 --> 25:09.360]  Not that it's not to you, but on a medical patient end and you're trying to keep it's
[25:09.600 --> 25:14.640]  every grain. So just like you, I'll tumble this and I can look at it with a microscope.
[25:14.680 --> 25:16.360]  I see there's still material on it.
[25:16.760 --> 25:19.280]  So my what I call my dead material.
[25:22.120 --> 25:24.080]  Guess what goes in a crockpot with butter?
[25:25.760 --> 25:27.680]  Always material in there.
[25:27.800 --> 25:34.240]  I may have extracted stuff out of it, but I won't throw material away until I know the
[25:34.240 --> 25:37.800]  microscope that, you know, it's it's it's good to go.
[25:37.880 --> 25:38.920]  There's nothing left in it.
[25:39.360 --> 25:44.720]  So if that makes any sense, we're going to make this other camera roll remote.
[25:45.240 --> 25:49.400]  That way I can start showing you personally what's coming out of this, that maybe you
[25:49.400 --> 25:52.880]  can give me a hint or two and and see what we're going to do next.
[25:52.960 --> 26:00.720]  You know, because I've smashed hash one time, about five, six grams of Skywalker.
[26:00.720 --> 26:02.360]  And obviously you probably know, too.
[26:02.760 --> 26:06.200]  Not good. But here's the product.
[26:06.240 --> 26:08.920]  Here's the product that I did come up with.
[26:10.360 --> 26:13.720]  So. Hopefully you can see the color there.
[26:15.680 --> 26:18.280]  There we go. There we go.
[26:18.280 --> 26:19.560]  Now I can see. Thank you, Peter.
[26:20.120 --> 26:26.560]  So that's the cam nice and white, like you'd expect out of a water wash and a freeze
[26:26.560 --> 26:29.360]  dryer. And then that's the second tumble.
[26:29.600 --> 26:30.800]  So, again, I.
[26:32.400 --> 26:35.200]  I know it's in there, but.
[26:36.200 --> 26:39.280]  That's also why I invented this little guy.
[26:42.630 --> 26:46.910]  So I could refine that's further.
[26:51.130 --> 26:57.010]  Just like you have water bags, one twenty seventy five and a forty five micron
[26:57.570 --> 27:03.930]  vibrator that I'm able to actually make this thing work and it separates them mechanically
[27:03.930 --> 27:08.570]  and dry. So when I take this material and dry.
[27:08.730 --> 27:14.010]  See that and I have other seeds to twenty through what micron should I be using to
[27:14.010 --> 27:15.450]  create what I want there for.
[27:16.690 --> 27:18.450]  Forty five to one fifty nine.
[27:18.450 --> 27:21.010]  So you should be using a forty five and a one sixty.
[27:21.690 --> 27:24.690]  So just a one sixty a forty five and I'm done.
[27:25.810 --> 27:31.890]  Now, I use one above it to catch stuff to refine it to before it goes in.
[27:31.930 --> 27:34.690]  So use a one ninety one sixty and a forty five.
[27:35.330 --> 27:40.370]  OK, one ninety one sixty to forty five and I want the forty five that's under that
[27:40.370 --> 27:43.490]  seed, right? So I want to.
[27:45.170 --> 27:48.890]  You want the one that the forty five is catching inside of it, not under it.
[27:49.370 --> 27:51.970]  Underneath what falls down underneath.
[27:52.010 --> 27:53.170]  OK, cool. Yeah.
[27:53.210 --> 27:57.170]  The one underneath you could use that for other other things like you've been talking
[27:57.170 --> 28:02.890]  about, but your your main focus is going to be on the one that's inside the forty five.
[28:03.450 --> 28:08.370]  Gotcha. And I'm going to pan over real quick to this flower seed that I made, dude.
[28:09.090 --> 28:12.650]  So I found all these seeds online.
[28:12.850 --> 28:19.010]  OK, you buy a flower seed with a bottom pan and it comes with the one that says pre-roll
[28:19.010 --> 28:22.530]  on it. And I figured all the mesh and micron charts out.
[28:22.730 --> 28:24.130]  And this is what I came up with.
[28:24.490 --> 28:28.690]  So this huge shaker is the next step up from this.
[28:33.330 --> 28:39.210]  Just like a tumbler you've seen out there, but on the down low cost, man, one hundred
[28:39.210 --> 28:40.170]  twenty bucks.
[28:41.730 --> 28:43.370]  Shout out the pollen extractor.
[28:43.370 --> 28:45.010]  I probably ran three pounds.
[28:46.090 --> 28:47.090]  That's pretty cool.
[28:47.690 --> 28:53.610]  Yeah. And it's the small scale that they come with a one eighty or a one fifty micron
[28:53.690 --> 28:55.170]  that's running the one fifty.
[28:55.570 --> 28:58.730]  So this is truly all just one fifty.
[28:59.410 --> 29:01.730]  Have you done any static tech to any of that?
[29:02.330 --> 29:08.650]  Yeah, actually, in the bottom of that other seed, I have a black piece of plastic that
[29:08.650 --> 29:10.810]  I'm hoping that we'll grab with static.
[29:12.170 --> 29:17.170]  Well, you know, it's it's it's a matter of getting the right material, like, you know,
[29:17.250 --> 29:20.490]  getting the right temperatures, all that shit down.
[29:20.850 --> 29:24.970]  So what we're going to do now is probably I'm going to have David grab that box, extract
[29:24.970 --> 29:29.090]  that stuff out just to show you, and then we'll freeze this bag, smash it.
[29:29.330 --> 29:33.050]  And then I'll have hopefully about twelve grams, I'm hoping.
[29:33.130 --> 29:35.770]  I'm not even going to extra sieve it on this.
[29:35.890 --> 29:38.610]  Just going to run it like you just said, let's sit there and vibrate.
[29:38.930 --> 29:40.810]  See what we come up by the end of the show.
[29:41.730 --> 29:42.810]  Hopefully I smash it.
[29:42.970 --> 29:45.130]  Hopefully not. OK.
[29:46.810 --> 29:51.370]  During this period, I wanted to go over kind of as a patient, how I learned.
[29:51.690 --> 29:58.050]  OK. Back from those laboratory days off grid, I always remember a magical little heated
[29:58.050 --> 29:59.130]  spinner. OK.
[30:00.530 --> 30:04.050]  People stop rewiring coffee makers.
[30:04.330 --> 30:05.930]  This thing is 60 bucks.
[30:06.370 --> 30:12.330]  It's a hot plate that has a stirrer in it and you can make your own RSO right there.
[30:13.090 --> 30:14.810]  Stop trying to blow yourself up.
[30:15.650 --> 30:21.610]  So if you are someone that wants to consume with alcohol, that's where I started right
[30:21.610 --> 30:25.130]  there. That will do the same thing as a Levo.
[30:25.250 --> 30:30.210]  You just need to sit there and maintain the temperature, maintain the speed, time it, all
[30:30.210 --> 30:34.250]  of that. So if somebody is on the cheap and can't afford any of this, this is where I
[30:34.250 --> 30:36.090]  started. I don't know, seven years ago.
[30:36.970 --> 30:38.530]  And I make my edibles with it.
[30:39.730 --> 30:43.290]  Another trick to edibles is this product.
[30:46.330 --> 30:47.290]  It's Everclear.
[30:48.770 --> 30:54.770]  And a half ounce of any marijuana.
[30:55.890 --> 31:00.410]  Put it in your grow room and let it create your own CBN.
[31:01.330 --> 31:06.930]  You can buy products at dispensaries that have CBN in them, but really nobody knows how
[31:06.930 --> 31:14.810]  to create it. Any broken down CBN or any broken down THC is going to create CBN and CBG.
[31:15.130 --> 31:17.370]  In Michigan, they sell this.
[31:19.010 --> 31:19.930]  I can't get this here.
[31:20.530 --> 31:22.890]  They don't sell anything over 100 milligrams here.
[31:23.010 --> 31:23.770]  It's pathetic.
[31:24.570 --> 31:29.930]  I try and mirror this medication because I know it works and I haven't touched this in
[31:29.930 --> 31:34.010]  about three, four months because my product works just fine.
[31:34.890 --> 31:39.090]  Another product we're about to make with the Levo is a salve out of coconut oil.
[31:39.170 --> 31:40.570]  I can buy this in Michigan.
[31:40.610 --> 31:42.970]  You can't buy this in Illinois because of their laws.
[31:43.250 --> 31:45.050]  It's got too much medication in it.
[31:45.650 --> 31:46.730]  I'll repeat that.
[31:47.250 --> 31:53.010]  You can't buy this in Illinois because it has too much medication in it.
[31:53.810 --> 31:59.050]  Shout out to 420 dispensary or extractions.
[31:59.050 --> 32:01.850]  It's a place in Michigan right by Jackson.
[32:02.210 --> 32:03.170]  That's their brand.
[32:03.570 --> 32:06.250]  They've been helping me on making my own.
[32:07.730 --> 32:12.010]  Weezer, is it 100 milligrams is the max for you?
[32:12.490 --> 32:13.770]  Yeah, in Illinois.
[32:13.770 --> 32:14.570]  Here, look at this.
[32:15.250 --> 32:16.290]  Where's my other sticker?
[32:16.810 --> 32:20.490]  In Illinois, this is a dispensary chocolate bar that I purchased.
[32:20.570 --> 32:21.770]  100 milligrams.
[32:21.770 --> 32:22.770]  I don't know.
[32:22.770 --> 32:24.490]  It's a company from here in Colorado.
[32:25.130 --> 32:26.850]  Do they sell over 100 grams?
[32:27.130 --> 32:27.730]  They used to.
[32:27.730 --> 32:30.570]  They, I don't think we're allowed to do it over a hundred either.
[32:30.890 --> 32:34.650]  They used to have a thousand milligrams, but to be honest, I ate one of those and I, I
[32:34.650 --> 32:36.530]  mean, I drooled on myself and went to sleep.
[32:37.050 --> 32:37.930]  So I don't know.
[32:38.250 --> 32:38.530]  Yeah.
[32:38.530 --> 32:39.810]  I'm not after a thousand.
[32:39.810 --> 32:41.850]  I'm saying I've seen it.
[32:41.890 --> 32:43.410]  That's the most I've ever seen it.
[32:43.530 --> 32:45.170]  And to be honest, it was too much.
[32:45.690 --> 32:46.290]  I don't know.
[32:46.290 --> 32:46.850]  I don't know.
[32:46.850 --> 32:47.330]  I don't know.
[32:47.330 --> 32:47.850]  I don't know.
[32:47.850 --> 32:48.370]  I don't know.
[32:48.370 --> 32:48.890]  I don't know.
[32:48.890 --> 32:49.370]  I don't know.
[32:49.370 --> 32:50.210]  It was too much.
[32:50.490 --> 32:54.890]  And, um, I think it was a lady from like the New York times or something.
[32:54.890 --> 33:00.770]  She came to Colorado and she ate an edible and then she wrote a horrible article about
[33:00.970 --> 33:02.930]  the effects of cannabis and that kind of stuff.
[33:02.930 --> 33:06.810]  And it really affected the way I feel like a lot of people view dosage.
[33:08.130 --> 33:10.730]  And, and you know what, everybody's different, man.
[33:11.330 --> 33:17.930]  You can't say that you're a person that can take a dosage and not really be able to
[33:17.930 --> 33:18.410]  handle it.
[33:18.850 --> 33:23.090]  Uh, I have one person that I know that can only take two milligrams.
[33:23.690 --> 33:27.570]  I take 10 and I'm going to say this.
[33:28.330 --> 33:35.370]  If I take 10 of that crap and compared to something I make, it's not the same time.
[33:36.250 --> 33:36.970]  At all.
[33:37.210 --> 33:38.490]  I don't feel the same.
[33:38.530 --> 33:40.050]  My stuff puts me to sleep.
[33:40.050 --> 33:41.810]  My stuff takes my pain away.
[33:42.570 --> 33:48.490]  And obviously I don't feel the psychic, uh, psychiatric or psychedelic effects from it.
[33:48.490 --> 33:50.450]  I can feel it remove the fucking pain.
[33:51.010 --> 33:53.370]  So to me, it's a no brainer.
[33:53.850 --> 33:57.050]  Uh, grab those glasses over there.
[33:57.130 --> 34:00.970]  This morning when I was getting ready, I wanted to really show off this levo and what it
[34:00.970 --> 34:01.450]  can do.
[34:01.450 --> 34:05.850]  And some, the way I treat myself to replicate this, okay.
[34:07.930 --> 34:08.690]  There's a levo.
[34:09.090 --> 34:17.050]  And again, I can do it old school, but you can take MCT oil, which is what that purple
[34:17.050 --> 34:17.690]  bottle is.
[34:17.810 --> 34:19.410]  And this is clear MCT oil.
[34:20.570 --> 34:22.450]  And you can make your own THCA.
[34:22.450 --> 34:24.610]  I pointed this out on Instagram.
[34:25.610 --> 34:29.690]  You do not decarb, put it in the machine and you just run it.
[34:29.730 --> 34:34.570]  And their, uh, their calculator says to run it for two and a half hours at a higher
[34:34.570 --> 34:35.170]  temperature.
[34:35.530 --> 34:39.130]  I run it for three and a half hours at about 20 degrees less.
[34:39.570 --> 34:44.410]  And I find that it's more powerful and does not, uh, get me high.
[34:45.050 --> 34:46.330]  And I'm after that one.
[34:46.330 --> 34:49.890]  It's just when I teach somebody how to do that, because some people don't want to get
[34:49.890 --> 34:51.970]  high, but they want the medical benefits.
[34:53.090 --> 34:58.690]  Last next to it is same machine, same process, same strain, but I decarbed it in the
[34:58.690 --> 34:59.770]  levo beforehand.
[34:59.770 --> 35:03.970]  And obviously, you know, that looks like a nice extraction of vape style.
[35:03.970 --> 35:06.210]  But now those colors and stuff that you'd like to see.
[35:06.610 --> 35:10.770]  So that's truly decarb and that is going to kick your ass.
[35:11.410 --> 35:12.890]  This is MCT oil.
[35:13.010 --> 35:16.370]  There is no, uh, no sugar in it at all.
[35:16.450 --> 35:17.210]  All clean.
[35:17.330 --> 35:22.090]  And, and when I would speak at dispensaries, that's when Peter, can you change me over
[35:22.090 --> 35:23.010]  to the other camera?
[35:23.010 --> 35:24.370]  I'm done with the remote for now.
[35:24.970 --> 35:30.410]  When I would speak at dispensaries, I would try and teach people that if you're a larger
[35:30.410 --> 35:37.490]  person and you eat a lot of pasta and wheat and sugar and oil based edible is going to
[35:37.490 --> 35:40.650]  work on you a lot better because your body doesn't recognize it.
[35:40.650 --> 35:42.290]  And it just wants to gobble it up.
[35:42.290 --> 35:47.170]  It's so sick of that fucking sugar that it's going to oil is going to be more effective.
[35:47.450 --> 35:50.970]  If you're somebody like me at, you know, my diet's been all over the place, but if
[35:50.970 --> 35:54.530]  you're somebody like me, it's a lot of meat, a lot of avocados, a lot of oil based.
[35:55.130 --> 35:59.810]  This is why I make chocolate is because that sugar is the carrier and it makes the
[35:59.810 --> 36:03.410]  medication work better and quicker for sure.
[36:03.810 --> 36:09.490]  So when you apply these edibles to yourself, you truly need to think about, well, what's
[36:09.490 --> 36:10.370]  my diet doing?
[36:11.410 --> 36:17.970]  And my diet's been horrible because I haven't been in control of my own diet, relying on
[36:17.970 --> 36:19.930]  someone else that kept me alive for sure.
[36:20.050 --> 36:23.690]  I love her to death and wouldn't be here without her period.
[36:24.210 --> 36:28.650]  But you wake up again, you're like, oh man, another health problem pops up and you're
[36:28.650 --> 36:29.610]  like, okay, I got it.
[36:29.610 --> 36:31.130]  I got to get back to being me again.
[36:31.850 --> 36:38.130]  And it's a fluctuation because if you're high on sugar all the time, you need oil to
[36:38.130 --> 36:42.330]  treat yourself. If you're treating yourself correctly and you're eating correctly with
[36:42.330 --> 36:44.970]  oils and fats, the sugar is going to affect you.
[36:45.210 --> 36:49.890]  So you have to balance all that out to remediate pain.
[36:49.970 --> 36:53.290]  And I hope to God, Toad is watching this because I feel him.
[36:53.290 --> 36:56.170]  I watch him and he's in a bad spot.
[36:56.210 --> 36:59.330]  So anybody that can support him as well, I'd like to see that.
[36:59.890 --> 37:06.250]  But hopefully that explains some of the things that I understand about my body and how to
[37:06.250 --> 37:07.650]  treat it correctly.
[37:10.010 --> 37:19.170]  The oils are cool, but the key is to recreate that salve and not be able to put beeswax
[37:19.170 --> 37:21.650]  in it, put oils in it, put other shit in it.
[37:22.650 --> 37:24.690]  So right in that Levo.
[37:29.270 --> 37:32.510]  Get it to focus here, regenerating coconut oil.
[37:33.910 --> 37:39.070]  If it's paste, you're going to be able to melt it and you're going to be able to have
[37:39.070 --> 37:39.910]  paste again.
[37:40.550 --> 37:44.590]  So for inflammation, again, I do not want to.
[37:46.590 --> 37:49.590]  I do not want to put true THC in it.
[37:49.710 --> 37:54.950]  I just want THC and I want that to soak in the best that it possibly can.
[37:56.310 --> 38:01.830]  The only way to do that is to not have beeswax in the way, not have all those other
[38:01.830 --> 38:05.510]  additives that the 420 Extreme people put in their stuff.
[38:05.950 --> 38:08.430]  I just like coconut oil because you can eat it.
[38:08.830 --> 38:13.030]  You can smear it all over your body, as you guys all well know.
[38:13.030 --> 38:15.150]  You can cook with it, all that stuff.
[38:15.190 --> 38:18.190]  So in this thing, it's real easy.
[38:19.110 --> 38:24.430]  If you look on my Instagram, you'll see that I test all my products with a place
[38:24.430 --> 38:26.830]  called Orego Labs.
[38:26.870 --> 38:31.150]  Shout out to them for working with me as an independent medical person, because what
[38:31.150 --> 38:31.790]  do they do?
[38:32.070 --> 38:33.670]  They test for Illinois all the time.
[38:34.310 --> 38:39.150]  And I'm sure that gets old, getting product, having to reject it, having to tell
[38:39.150 --> 38:41.270]  people there's too much solvent in their product.
[38:41.270 --> 38:47.910]  And then I show up and the Elevate Gelatin Mo that I brought in at 33%, they said is
[38:47.910 --> 38:50.950]  the highest that a personal person has ever brought in.
[38:51.230 --> 38:55.510]  So when I do that math, I know how to make my edibles.
[38:55.550 --> 38:56.670]  I know how to make salve.
[38:56.710 --> 38:57.950]  I'm about to make this thing.
[38:57.990 --> 38:59.270]  What the hell are we putting in it?
[38:59.830 --> 39:02.430]  So scale it up.
[39:03.390 --> 39:07.270]  You do your math based on 28% because this is gorilla cookies.
[39:08.590 --> 39:12.110]  It works out to always to about 1,100 for an eighth.
[39:12.550 --> 39:13.990]  So I'll weigh out an eighth.
[39:15.910 --> 39:17.830]  Or I'm sorry, I'll weigh out a quarter ounce.
[39:18.590 --> 39:21.030]  And I'll make one cup of this material.
[39:21.430 --> 39:29.030]  Now, when you do this, a lot of people on the Lebo sites will say, oh, you can't find
[39:29.030 --> 39:29.670]  grind it.
[39:30.070 --> 39:32.670]  You can't make it too fine.
[39:32.950 --> 39:37.070]  And I'll tell you straight out, I'm putting it in that nut grinder and I'm making it as
[39:37.070 --> 39:42.350]  fine as possible because if there's a little bit of debris that comes out of it, I'm not
[39:42.350 --> 39:44.470]  vaping it, putting it on my skin.
[39:44.550 --> 39:46.550]  I don't care if marijuana touches my skin.
[39:47.070 --> 39:49.070]  So to me, it's not that big a deal.
[39:50.590 --> 39:53.110]  So basically, I'll take it, weigh it out.
[39:54.870 --> 39:58.870]  Because he's closer, I'll have David nut grind this.
[40:01.390 --> 40:08.950]  And again, the medical end of this, you guys can all do this at home.
[40:09.430 --> 40:11.710]  You don't need this fancy fucking nut grinder.
[40:13.070 --> 40:14.670]  You can just sit there and break it up.
[40:15.670 --> 40:20.510]  This little container that the Lebo comes with, a lot of people say to take that rubber
[40:20.510 --> 40:22.190]  thing out. Don't do it.
[40:23.590 --> 40:25.190]  Yeah, just give a couple taps, shake it up and down.
[40:26.310 --> 40:31.830]  Don't do it because that is a main filter for large debris that settles downward.
[40:31.870 --> 40:34.190]  When this thing spins around, the force goes downward.
[40:35.310 --> 40:36.470]  Little cap goes on it.
[40:37.470 --> 40:45.750]  And when you use it, when you decarb, this little funnel that comes out, it's got a
[40:45.750 --> 40:46.830]  little spinner inside.
[40:46.830 --> 40:48.310]  OK, magnetic spinner.
[40:49.150 --> 40:51.870]  You need to clean this every time.
[40:52.150 --> 40:54.110]  And I know this from experience.
[40:54.550 --> 41:02.670]  If you leave oil or coconut oil or my main mistake, honey, and you try and decarb the
[41:02.670 --> 41:04.710]  next batch. Guess what happens?
[41:05.110 --> 41:07.190]  Yeah, black carbon everywhere.
[41:07.190 --> 41:09.550]  And it took me about an hour to clean that son of a bitch.
[41:09.550 --> 41:12.870]  So big, big lesson learned on that one.
[41:14.630 --> 41:18.150]  So material all ground up by Mr.
[41:18.150 --> 41:26.360]  Dave here. Just two or three presses on that thing.
[41:30.440 --> 41:32.280]  Look at how fucking sticky that is.
[41:32.360 --> 41:38.960]  This these stems snap, guys, that's been drying out in the air in a furnace home for
[41:38.960 --> 41:40.080]  about two days.
[41:40.480 --> 41:42.360]  So I'd say moisture is nil.
[41:42.720 --> 41:45.120]  So that's all medication there.
[41:47.480 --> 41:48.480]  When you put it in.
[41:50.400 --> 41:55.920]  You're going to want to tamp it down, kind of like making cappuccino or all that stuff
[41:55.920 --> 42:00.600]  to have the little tampers, but you don't want to press it down as so hard to where
[42:01.280 --> 42:03.400]  the coconut oil won't flow through it.
[42:04.400 --> 42:05.400]  So.
[42:05.680 --> 42:10.800]  Levo is watching this, I think Peter might have an invite from them or they're reaching
[42:10.800 --> 42:15.920]  out, that would be awesome because I haven't really seen them be so cannabis based.
[42:16.560 --> 42:21.960]  They show it. They have another market, obviously, but for them to tune in and see the
[42:21.960 --> 42:23.640]  little tricks would be great.
[42:24.240 --> 42:26.800]  There's a chef on YouTube, too, that here watch.
[42:27.920 --> 42:29.800]  All I do is tap it down once or twice.
[42:30.800 --> 42:35.800]  There's a chef that talks about this and he removes that screen, doesn't use it and
[42:35.800 --> 42:40.080]  gets a French press filter and puts it inside that thing.
[42:40.480 --> 42:42.840]  Again, it gets clogged up with too much crap.
[42:43.200 --> 42:47.920]  He says it makes it a stronger product, but I'm not worried about that when I'm trying
[42:47.920 --> 42:53.480]  to deal with things that need to be cleaned up and do the goddamn dishes.
[42:53.480 --> 42:54.600]  I do enough dishes.
[42:54.600 --> 42:56.000]  So one cup.
[42:56.280 --> 43:02.120]  This solid material melts inside that machine, comes out liquid.
[43:07.160 --> 43:09.200]  You put it in whatever container you want.
[43:11.000 --> 43:20.100]  And it winds up just like that again, because it's rejuvenating.
[43:20.740 --> 43:23.380]  If you use MCT oil, that's not going to work.
[43:24.020 --> 43:29.860]  Again, I don't want this to affect me or get me high.
[43:30.580 --> 43:36.460]  I want all of the medical benefits of inflammation being cut.
[43:36.460 --> 43:40.900]  So you can see I'll lean it over so we don't have to get the camera.
[43:41.100 --> 43:42.300]  It's a WOD, you guys.
[43:43.940 --> 43:45.020]  Put that WOD in there.
[43:47.900 --> 43:48.980]  Program the time.
[43:48.980 --> 43:53.260]  And they have all these instructions on their website.
[43:54.420 --> 43:55.620]  Actually, fire that back up.
[43:55.620 --> 43:56.380]  We'll show them real quick.
[43:57.100 --> 43:58.220]  The phone, wherever that is.
[44:00.260 --> 44:02.460]  It's, see how it just melts in my hand.
[44:02.460 --> 44:07.260]  So it'll be solid in a container, but that's how you apply it to yourself.
[44:11.700 --> 44:13.300]  There's several different settings here.
[44:13.300 --> 44:15.740]  So you can dry it if it's a wet cannabis.
[44:17.540 --> 44:19.380]  You can activate it and decarb it.
[44:19.420 --> 44:20.460]  I don't want to do that.
[44:21.940 --> 44:23.060]  Or you can just infuse it.
[44:23.140 --> 44:24.140]  And that's what I'm after.
[44:25.140 --> 44:27.060]  Now, again, that's a good temperature.
[44:27.100 --> 44:28.620]  I don't want my cannabis cooked.
[44:28.660 --> 44:30.500]  I don't want this to activate it at all.
[44:30.940 --> 44:35.420]  Two hours is good enough because with a sab, it's gonna melt it.
[44:35.660 --> 44:38.740]  That short of amount of time.
[44:38.780 --> 44:42.260]  And I'm not worried about getting so much out of it.
[44:42.260 --> 44:45.500]  It's different when you're dealing with the paste.
[44:45.740 --> 44:50.220]  When you deal with MCT oil, because MCT oil is actually thicker
[44:50.500 --> 44:51.780]  than the paste when it melts.
[44:51.820 --> 44:52.620]  It's just different.
[44:53.020 --> 44:55.900]  I ran one for three hours one time and it kind of smelt burnt.
[44:56.300 --> 44:58.460]  So let's just up it to 160.
[45:00.920 --> 45:05.400]  It'll warm up and then it'll make another noise when that starts to work.
[45:09.210 --> 45:13.810]  You know, I'm glad that you brought up all these different carriers,
[45:14.130 --> 45:17.930]  because I don't think people really think about what that is.
[45:19.330 --> 45:22.050]  A way to deliver into your body as quick as possible.
[45:22.050 --> 45:26.050]  So thank you for sharing that gold nugget about if you're on a high sugar diet,
[45:26.050 --> 45:28.570]  you want to focus on oils for your edible.
[45:29.570 --> 45:34.610]  If you're on a healthy, vegetarian based diet or even a regular,
[45:34.610 --> 45:35.850]  just healthy diet,
[45:36.530 --> 45:41.050]  then sugar may actually be a better carrier for you to get your medicine to you.
[45:41.370 --> 45:43.130]  So thank you. That was a good gold bar brother.
[45:43.730 --> 45:47.170]  Thank you. And it's all about medicine, right? It's not a matter of,
[45:47.250 --> 45:49.970]  like Bird said, there's quality in everything.
[45:50.450 --> 45:54.530]  It's just maybe something's not extracting best for this person or that person,
[45:54.530 --> 45:59.330]  but where are the people that are truly searching for that?
[45:59.810 --> 46:03.330]  There's one of them right there in my lower right hand corner with a fucking
[46:03.330 --> 46:08.090]  bird on his shirt. Thank you. No bullshit. Because without you,
[46:09.130 --> 46:15.410]  um, hold on. Without you,
[46:17.170 --> 46:21.050]  I'd still be burning incense instead of sipping my medication.
[46:22.050 --> 46:27.050]  And when you only have a little bit to grow and a little bit at your disposal,
[46:27.930 --> 46:31.370]  that hash burning in that pipe, like incense,
[46:32.050 --> 46:36.250]  it's wasting my medicine. So let's open this guy up.
[46:40.170 --> 46:41.650]  While you're opening that up. Uh,
[46:41.690 --> 46:45.130]  we also interviewed Bird where he breaks down a lot of this stuff,
[46:45.370 --> 46:47.930]  shows you a to Z how to make a temple ball.
[46:47.930 --> 46:51.810]  So for you guys that maybe missed that episode, go check that out as well.
[46:52.250 --> 46:55.330]  Uh, well Bird breaks down a lot of that stuff and we kind of have an in depth,
[46:55.370 --> 46:59.970]  uh, talk on a variety of different things. A very candid interview. Uh, so yeah,
[46:59.970 --> 47:03.570]  check that out. Yeah, for sure. That episode is awesome. And uh,
[47:04.730 --> 47:08.930]  I mean, listen guys, how often does it two,
[47:08.970 --> 47:12.890]  is it two years running? They didn't have the cup, right? It's two years running,
[47:14.210 --> 47:17.410]  but two year running champion sharing his secrets.
[47:18.130 --> 47:20.490]  I dare you to fucking beat him.
[47:21.170 --> 47:25.250]  I dare you because you're not going to be able to do it. You want to know why?
[47:27.290 --> 47:30.090]  He learned from someone that's no longer with us.
[47:31.090 --> 47:33.410]  And that's invaluable.
[47:34.410 --> 47:36.850]  This is the grill cookies.
[47:39.410 --> 47:40.330]  It's good material.
[47:42.170 --> 47:46.290]  It's just slow going. And when you're at home, you don't, you know,
[47:46.330 --> 47:50.090]  you don't need to produce it. It's cool that I'm treating myself medically,
[47:50.090 --> 47:53.090]  but you need to understand that Bird
[47:54.970 --> 47:59.770]  is fucking paychecks depend on this medical. Great.
[47:59.810 --> 48:03.170]  He's he's for the right reasons, but if he doesn't succeed,
[48:04.330 --> 48:09.050]  who's fucking paying his mortgage? That's a lot. That's a lot.
[48:09.730 --> 48:14.050]  So when you look at all of that together, here, let's freeze this again.
[48:14.890 --> 48:18.370]  Look at all that together. He doesn't have to succeed.
[48:19.490 --> 48:23.730]  He wants to succeed when you have to start doing things.
[48:24.050 --> 48:26.970]  It's when you're going to fail and you're going to produce an inferior product.
[48:27.890 --> 48:29.410]  I know this from my own business.
[48:29.450 --> 48:31.970]  I've shared with who I am with Layton and Brian,
[48:31.970 --> 48:35.010]  and they see the quality there and the people that I do it for.
[48:35.010 --> 48:38.610]  And they wouldn't turn to me if I didn't know what the hell I was talking about.
[48:39.090 --> 48:40.290]  So again,
[48:41.290 --> 48:44.130]  I'm just telling you about me and what I know for me,
[48:44.490 --> 48:49.490]  never proven by a science test outside of the labs I test my products with or
[48:49.810 --> 48:54.330]  send them to the trust. So what I'll do now,
[48:55.370 --> 48:57.450]  here's your container, 150 micron.
[49:03.710 --> 49:07.190]  And the material is not cashed you guys, but this is that gorilla cookies that
[49:08.150 --> 49:11.590]  it's the nugs are so hard. They're not loose. Okay.
[49:11.590 --> 49:14.150]  Okay. So I'm going to get that first extraction out of it.
[49:14.150 --> 49:15.150]  That's really yellow,
[49:15.710 --> 49:19.070]  but now I'm going to throw it in that nut grinder and do another mechanical
[49:19.070 --> 49:22.950]  surfacing and get one more pull out of it.
[49:28.810 --> 49:33.810]  And I don't know if the pollen extractor guy actually expected people like me to
[49:34.210 --> 49:37.330]  run pounds of material through his product,
[49:38.090 --> 49:41.810]  but I'm going to show it to you here. It's so simple.
[49:42.330 --> 49:44.610]  It's got a little switch and a little timer here.
[49:44.610 --> 49:48.930]  You can speed this thing up to a constant roll or clicks and stops.
[49:50.130 --> 49:53.610]  It's all just plastic. So you're not going to have any metal in your product.
[49:53.690 --> 49:57.050]  The only thing that did fail again, I've run about three pounds through this.
[49:57.770 --> 50:01.570]  I had to remake this piece and it took a little bit of figuring out to remake
[50:01.590 --> 50:05.810]  that little plastic piece, but it's not a big deal. One,
[50:05.830 --> 50:09.730]  I want medicine. So this is a fresh grind.
[50:09.730 --> 50:14.450]  We bumped it a few times, put it back in and we'll tumble it.
[50:14.450 --> 50:19.370]  And I expect things to get a lot greener now,
[50:19.370 --> 50:20.210]  Bird.
[50:21.090 --> 50:25.130]  Weezer, give a shout out to that company that makes that pollen extractor.
[50:26.050 --> 50:28.410]  Just in the name, pollen extractor.
[50:29.410 --> 50:31.050]  It doesn't get any simpler than that.
[50:31.490 --> 50:32.330]  Yep. Yep.
[50:32.570 --> 50:37.490]  You can go on their website and you can order a 180 or a 120 micron.
[50:38.210 --> 50:42.530]  You can order it in us or in, uh,
[50:42.850 --> 50:47.330]  Europe plugs and German plugs and any kind of electrical source.
[50:47.730 --> 50:51.050]  They make all of them. So no matter where you're at in the world,
[50:51.090 --> 50:55.570]  this guy's ships out of France and he, uh, he makes your power happen.
[50:56.130 --> 51:00.170]  There's a bubble magic machine out there. That's like five or 600 bucks.
[51:00.210 --> 51:03.130]  I would love to buy one and have that you guys,
[51:03.150 --> 51:06.370]  but it doesn't fit in my freezer.
[51:07.570 --> 51:11.650]  So what am I going to do? Buy a big chest freezer to do this?
[51:11.890 --> 51:14.370]  The answer is no, I'm not going to do that.
[51:14.890 --> 51:20.090]  I'll buy another one of these like bird runs a $60 fucking
[51:20.090 --> 51:21.970]  washing machine side by side.
[51:22.130 --> 51:26.930]  I'll get five of these things running before I'll buy a $500
[51:26.930 --> 51:31.650]  unit that I need to buy a larger electronic freezer for. That's just silly.
[51:34.170 --> 51:36.770]  Hey, real quick. Shout out to one of the nicest guys in the industry.
[51:36.770 --> 51:40.810]  Tyler over there putting up his banner. Uh, yeah,
[51:42.010 --> 51:43.970]  you guys have never met him before. Honestly,
[51:43.970 --> 51:46.690]  one of the most genuine dudes in the industry. So, uh,
[51:46.730 --> 51:48.650]  Tyler appreciates you coming on buddy as well.
[51:49.410 --> 51:51.530]  Hey, Hey, thanks guys. Thanks for having me on here.
[51:51.930 --> 51:54.810]  Been a while since I've been on this group here. So, uh,
[51:55.530 --> 51:59.650]  glad to come on and chat with you guys about living soil, raised beds,
[51:59.690 --> 52:04.210]  pots, microbes, inoculants, um,
[52:04.250 --> 52:06.010]  what all of my customers are doing,
[52:06.090 --> 52:09.170]  all the crazy stuff going on in the industry right now. We're, uh,
[52:09.250 --> 52:11.330]  we're an open book around here guys. So we're glad to help
[52:12.530 --> 52:17.370]  you guys. This guy responded to me when he was on vacation in
[52:17.370 --> 52:22.330]  Malaysia. I was in Peru, South America.
[52:22.810 --> 52:26.410]  I'm nobody. I'm nobody again, like bird.
[52:27.250 --> 52:31.490]  They respond. They're real fucking people. So if you need true help,
[52:32.050 --> 52:36.530]  they're going to respond. Uh, great products, by the way, Tyler.
[52:37.010 --> 52:40.690]  I mean, thank you. Thank you guys. Your guys' success is, is our success.
[52:40.730 --> 52:43.930]  So I'm here to help everybody with, uh,
[52:43.970 --> 52:48.250]  the open amount of knowledge that I have. Um, and, uh, you know,
[52:48.250 --> 52:50.250]  just share what people are successful with. You know,
[52:50.250 --> 52:52.370]  I've realized that with grassroots is, you know,
[52:52.490 --> 52:56.490]  everything that people are doing great with let's highlight that and bring that
[52:56.490 --> 52:59.610]  out and, and share those great experiences with people. And,
[52:59.930 --> 53:02.730]  and at times there's definitely when we need to reflect on the things that
[53:02.730 --> 53:07.010]  didn't work out, right. That's for sure. So I haven't seen those things yet.
[53:08.290 --> 53:11.970]  Yeah. Not very many of them. That's for sure. As far as what comes from us.
[53:12.530 --> 53:14.290]  So a neat product that they have up,
[53:14.330 --> 53:19.170]  you guys is called a transplant denator and
[53:20.730 --> 53:23.690]  you think about the school fee name, but I gotta tell you
[53:23.810 --> 53:29.660]  what, because of the laws in Illinois,
[53:30.060 --> 53:33.100]  I can't have a plant five inches above the soil level.
[53:34.380 --> 53:38.660]  Where's the plant guys, not five inches above the soil level.
[53:39.180 --> 53:41.580]  So I grow them on their sides. Okay.
[53:43.420 --> 53:46.180]  When I water them, they're, they're straight and they're true,
[53:46.180 --> 53:50.900]  but to be able to do this and just open this up and look at my
[53:50.900 --> 53:55.060]  growth and look if I have rot and look, if I have a problem,
[53:56.060 --> 53:59.300]  you don't have that in the industry anywhere.
[54:00.020 --> 54:03.180]  And you got the special one with the liner there too. So you've got the,
[54:03.860 --> 54:06.740]  that's something just a few growers have been running.
[54:06.740 --> 54:09.020]  That's not a standardized product that we sell yet.
[54:09.020 --> 54:14.020]  That's something we've custom made for you there which is only the only way
[54:14.020 --> 54:15.100]  to go in my opinion,
[54:15.100 --> 54:19.100]  with that living soil liner because it really maintains the moisture levels and
[54:19.100 --> 54:23.740]  allows the roots to grow all the way to the edges and definitely defeats what
[54:23.740 --> 54:26.460]  everybody thought the great thing of air pruning was,
[54:26.460 --> 54:28.860]  which is definitely becoming a lot of myth.
[54:30.060 --> 54:31.700]  The, in your current pot,
[54:31.700 --> 54:34.060]  Does the bottom have a drain Tyler?
[54:34.140 --> 54:35.580]  Does the bottom have a drain on it?
[54:36.540 --> 54:39.300]  Yeah. The whole bottom of it is a normal fabric pot.
[54:39.300 --> 54:41.300]  So it drains evenly from the bottom,
[54:41.300 --> 54:44.340]  the bottom three or four inches around the sides and around the bottom.
[54:45.140 --> 54:49.140]  Obviously specifically to recreate the way native soil dries out from the top
[54:49.140 --> 54:49.980]  down.
[54:50.660 --> 54:52.300]  Fantastic. Great work, dude.
[54:54.180 --> 54:56.420]  And this all comes from our grassroots customers.
[54:56.420 --> 54:58.660]  We're just making stuff that they want us to make.
[54:58.660 --> 55:02.820]  So this is just stuff that you guys growers have wanted that now we mass
[55:02.820 --> 55:03.660]  produce.
[55:04.380 --> 55:08.860]  And when I ordered these five transplantinators, he, he goes,
[55:08.940 --> 55:11.220]  I don't know if it was Tyler or the other salesman. He goes, man,
[55:11.220 --> 55:12.820]  I'm just going to ship you these three leftovers.
[55:12.820 --> 55:16.660]  I want you to tell me the difference. And there's a difference. Huge.
[55:17.260 --> 55:22.260]  I watered these plants a week ago when I did the JMS solution.
[55:24.740 --> 55:29.100]  You guys, I didn't have to water the living soil ones yet.
[55:29.700 --> 55:34.660]  I had to water the other two yesterday because they were showing signs of
[55:34.660 --> 55:38.620]  need and water. Those living soil pots now are on a full,
[55:38.700 --> 55:43.420]  a full week Thursday to Thursday with no water. So, I mean,
[55:43.420 --> 55:46.780]  the plants are healthy, man. There, there's not a deficiency.
[55:47.620 --> 55:50.900]  And I see some people sometimes are concerned because they want to be doing
[55:51.500 --> 55:55.940]  a feeding so often and so frequently and stuff like that.
[55:55.940 --> 55:59.460]  And obviously allows you to know that you can rely on your soil and the
[55:59.460 --> 56:03.260]  nutrients within your soil. But if you wanted to,
[56:03.260 --> 56:07.140]  you could always do a beneficial foliar spray where you're feeding the surface
[56:07.140 --> 56:11.740]  of the plant. I know a lot of people talk about foliar sprays and IPM side of
[56:11.740 --> 56:12.020]  things,
[56:12.020 --> 56:15.620]  but I like to talk about foliar sprays is how we feed the plant on a,
[56:15.660 --> 56:20.660]  on a sometimes even daily basis. If you really want to push it further.
[56:21.460 --> 56:25.820]  Perfect segue into I'm missing an episode. You guys,
[56:25.860 --> 56:30.580]  I've watched several of Steve's. It's not him. There's a guy, I think in Vegas,
[56:30.580 --> 56:35.260]  he's in the desert somewhere. Double level, red hair, red beard.
[56:36.260 --> 56:39.540]  They take their three week larf bugs, trim them off.
[56:40.500 --> 56:44.260]  And I seem to remember he soaked them in brown sugar,
[56:45.580 --> 56:50.420]  fermented them on hour six during the flowering light.
[56:50.500 --> 56:51.860]  They turn the lights off,
[56:51.980 --> 56:56.980]  foliar feed and then turn the fucking lights back on during the flowering cycle.
[56:57.900 --> 57:01.620]  Who is that guy? What episode was that? Was again, there's so,
[57:01.660 --> 57:05.500]  you guys create so much awesome information. I'm looking for that.
[57:06.460 --> 57:10.460]  When I talked to Brian and I talked to Leighton about creating a true and true
[57:10.860 --> 57:12.380]  Korean natural farming or,
[57:12.380 --> 57:16.140]  or some type of worm castings or I don't really know what I want to do because I
[57:16.140 --> 57:20.100]  want to keep it small. Taking what comes from the plant,
[57:20.420 --> 57:24.380]  fermenting it and feeding it right back to it. I need to be right there.
[57:24.740 --> 57:28.860]  So if anybody out there at future cannabis project land knows what episode I'm
[57:28.860 --> 57:32.020]  talking about, hit me up on Instagram because that
[57:32.580 --> 57:33.860]  was it floor?
[57:35.580 --> 57:39.260]  I hold on a few lurk, got filler cannabis or something like that.
[57:39.340 --> 57:42.060]  FLE you are out of Vegas.
[57:43.260 --> 57:46.940]  It was out of Vegas. It was a huge dispensary. It was a huge place,
[57:46.980 --> 57:49.140]  a huge grower and they had it dialed in.
[57:49.380 --> 57:52.300]  The first guy to speak was at a red beard and red hair.
[57:52.580 --> 57:57.060]  The second guy to speak was a smaller dude and had black hair and a black beard.
[57:57.100 --> 57:58.300]  Yeah. You talked about
[58:00.180 --> 58:04.820]  yeah. So if they could hit me up that, that exact process. Yes,
[58:05.220 --> 58:09.420]  that's the guy. Cool. So now that it's on here,
[58:09.460 --> 58:13.340]  that's the guy that I'll find and reach out to him and get that process down
[58:13.380 --> 58:14.220]  because you guys,
[58:14.500 --> 58:18.780]  instead of making powdered flour to treat myself that way,
[58:19.740 --> 58:21.420]  I don't want to have to go get nutrients.
[58:21.420 --> 58:23.300]  I don't want to have to go get all that bullshit.
[58:23.340 --> 58:25.340]  Why can't I just feed them like Steve Kent?
[58:25.340 --> 58:29.100]  Well and that guy and take my old product that it's producing and it should be
[58:29.100 --> 58:33.060]  full circle. You should always be able to put 50% back in.
[58:33.700 --> 58:36.300]  When we open up the flower room in a little bit, you'll see,
[58:36.300 --> 58:40.460]  I don't peel those lot of bottom fan leaves.
[58:40.500 --> 58:44.540]  I don't peel those bottom buds. If I peel something underneath,
[58:45.180 --> 58:48.780]  it's out of necessity. If I peel something from underneath,
[58:48.820 --> 58:52.420]  I will leave the fan leaf and just pull the bud itself.
[58:52.700 --> 58:55.820]  That leaf for me is an indicator. When I grow,
[58:56.060 --> 58:57.780]  if something's wrong with my grow,
[58:57.980 --> 59:01.780]  it's going to fucking tell me and it's going to die before the top dies.
[59:02.260 --> 59:04.500]  So you guys have got it dialed in.
[59:04.580 --> 59:08.420]  That's why they do that is because they had it dialed in and they know what's
[59:08.460 --> 59:09.300]  going on.
[59:10.340 --> 59:14.580]  I recently visited that grow actually and got to tour the whole facility and got
[59:14.580 --> 59:18.180]  to see the progression because that was the first facility ever to run our
[59:18.180 --> 59:21.260]  living soil beds about four and a half years ago.
[59:21.660 --> 59:23.420]  And now they run two and a half,
[59:23.860 --> 59:28.260]  two foot deep beds because of the progression in yield and the difference in
[59:28.260 --> 59:32.260]  yield that they're seeing in between those different beds and different size
[59:32.620 --> 59:33.620]  soil masses.
[59:33.900 --> 59:37.820]  So we've recently learned some really interesting stuff now and are going to
[59:37.940 --> 59:42.660]  start pushing a deeper depth beds for larger grows because of them and their
[59:42.660 --> 59:43.540]  success they're having.
[59:44.660 --> 59:46.540]  That's a gold bar right there.
[59:46.620 --> 59:49.540]  I've been talking about depth for years and no one listened,
[59:49.620 --> 59:51.340]  but I'm so glad you said that.
[59:51.780 --> 59:52.420]  Well, yeah. I mean,
[59:52.420 --> 59:55.780]  they've got an upstairs and a downstairs facility and you look at the upstairs
[59:55.780 --> 59:56.780]  and you see the strains,
[59:56.780 --> 59:59.820]  you look at the downstairs facilities and you see the strains and it's,
[59:59.980 --> 01:00:01.020]  I mean it's a night and day difference.
[01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:04.820]  It looks like a totally different plant and you know, you got to harvest it.
[01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:07.660]  There's major, major differences they're having there.
[01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:10.380]  So it's some very exciting stuff for them.
[01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:15.580]  Do they leave the root balls in place and just plant again?
[01:00:16.140 --> 01:00:16.860]  Yeah. Yeah.
[01:00:16.860 --> 01:00:19.740]  They plant as close as they can back to that original root ball.
[01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:23.180]  Beautiful. Beautiful work.
[01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:24.780]  Are you using sleeves Tyler?
[01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:26.340]  I'm sorry?
[01:00:26.340 --> 01:00:27.780]  Those guys are using sleeves?
[01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:29.700]  No, not yet. No.
[01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:31.700]  Okay. And the sleeves,
[01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:36.740]  Steve had pointed out a few episodes ago on a two by four bed that we're going to
[01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:38.260]  build here for inside.
[01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:41.900]  I don't know how well that would work because I'm limited.
[01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:42.940]  You know what I mean?
[01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:44.980]  So I may wind up having to dig,
[01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:47.820]  but how much height do you lose?
[01:00:47.860 --> 01:00:49.020]  How tall are those sleeves?
[01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:50.460]  They're seven inches.
[01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:52.620]  So there are seven inches by seven inches.
[01:00:53.740 --> 01:00:56.780]  You know, even if you did recess them into the soil a couple of inches,
[01:00:56.780 --> 01:00:57.620]  which is great.
[01:00:57.980 --> 01:01:01.340]  You know, I think that technique really comes from,
[01:01:01.780 --> 01:01:05.420]  you know, obviously the goal of eliminating transplant shock.
[01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:09.460]  You know, let's say that that is the first technique or the first goal of that
[01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:10.460]  is, you know,
[01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:14.500]  we're going to take that plant that's rooted into that soil mass and just set it
[01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:15.580]  right on top of that soil.
[01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:16.860]  And it's going to blast, you know,
[01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:20.180]  into that and it's going to do great and you're going to prevent any ripping or
[01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:21.100]  tearing of the roots.
[01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:25.060]  Obviously you've got to watch that process and make sure you do that at just the
[01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:25.980]  right time. You know,
[01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:28.940]  you want those roots to always stay nice, fresh, and white.
[01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:32.220]  They ever seem like they look like they're turning a color or turning Brown,
[01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:33.380]  getting anaerobic, you know,
[01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:36.980]  that's obviously where you've waited too long to get that onto its new soil
[01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:40.900]  mass. So there's definitely a little bit of planning and doing with that.
[01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:44.580]  I think it might be a little bit much for a two by four bed. Hey,
[01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:47.900]  I'd love to sell you the sleeves, but in that small of a situation,
[01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:51.100]  it may not be necessary because honestly in that in a tent,
[01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:52.460]  you're going to want all the, all the,
[01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:56.580]  the height that you can get all the headroom possible. So.
[01:01:57.820 --> 01:02:01.820]  And that's perfect for you. And that's what I'm trying to show here too,
[01:02:01.820 --> 01:02:06.260]  is people who only have this, I have another bedroom.
[01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:08.620]  So people who only truly have this,
[01:02:09.540 --> 01:02:13.700]  a two by four bed will go in this tent.
[01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:15.980]  I don't recommend it. And here's why.
[01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:21.620]  The airflow that is down low is not going to be conducive to
[01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:26.460]  the plants we'll be producing. Will it happen? Sure.
[01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:28.780]  You better have a bottom fan pumping in,
[01:02:29.140 --> 01:02:31.540]  AC infinity controller running,
[01:02:31.580 --> 01:02:33.940]  both fans circulating that thing like a turbo,
[01:02:33.940 --> 01:02:36.500]  because it's going to run out of fresh air.
[01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:40.020]  But it's filled with soil by the time you just fill it with vegetation,
[01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:41.740]  you're stuck in the closet. So.
[01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:46.580]  Yeah. As a standard rule for putting beds in tents and beds in small areas,
[01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:50.780]  I say, don't do it unless you absolutely have to. I mean, obviously, you know,
[01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:53.220]  I'd rather run a three by three bed in a,
[01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:55.780]  just an eight by eight room with one light over the top of it,
[01:02:55.780 --> 01:02:59.900]  because the conditions are going to be so much easier to manage than in a small
[01:02:59.900 --> 01:03:00.940]  tent, small tents.
[01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:05.100]  There's such a pain in the butt and fluctuation and the negative and positive
[01:03:05.100 --> 01:03:07.780]  pressure and all that stuff. I mean, I, if for me,
[01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:11.140]  I'd rather get rid of the tent entirely and just run it in the room if I could.
[01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:15.500]  But having to run a tent and a bed in a tent, you're going to want to do a,
[01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:18.740]  you know, a four by four bed in a five by five tent,
[01:03:18.780 --> 01:03:21.780]  just for those reasons that you said is we need that air circulation.
[01:03:21.780 --> 01:03:24.500]  We need that air movement. You know, if you want, you know,
[01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:27.580]  to beat mold or mildew and not have that in your grow,
[01:03:27.820 --> 01:03:29.340]  you need that air circulation.
[01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:33.180]  You need to be moving that climate from the bottom to the top constantly to
[01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:34.740]  prevent that also, you know,
[01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:39.300]  have proper levels of copper and sulfur in your plant to prevent against mold
[01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:42.420]  and mildew, obviously. But, you know,
[01:03:42.420 --> 01:03:47.220]  trying to have the right size container in there is very important because if
[01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:49.060]  you do this soil thing, right,
[01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:53.900]  if you do this living soil thing right and you get the chemical, you know,
[01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:59.540]  everything properly done, this plant and these plants are going to get much,
[01:03:59.540 --> 01:04:04.380]  much bigger than the outlying side of, of the container. So, you know,
[01:04:04.380 --> 01:04:08.380]  you're going to fill out a five by five area with a four by four tent easily.
[01:04:08.660 --> 01:04:12.940]  We have people filling out a five by five tent with a three by three bed and
[01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:17.420]  they're happier in that space doing four plants. So, you know,
[01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:21.380]  I think you really got to think about the progression of your living soil. And,
[01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:22.300]  you know,
[01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:26.740]  if you do manage it correctly and you are doing soil tests and you are getting
[01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:27.580]  things right,
[01:04:27.980 --> 01:04:31.820]  things are going to go so gangbusters and so crazy and it's going to turn into
[01:04:31.820 --> 01:04:36.260]  this big wheel that starts rolling. And I mean, you're going to have to flood it,
[01:04:36.260 --> 01:04:38.140]  destroy it, or, or, you know,
[01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:42.300]  dry it out to destroy it or to stop that big wheel from rolling. So,
[01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:45.780]  you know, that's the goal is get that thing rolling.
[01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:49.700]  And this program has taught me that.
[01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:52.020]  You're personally talking to you personally,
[01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:56.780]  talking to Leighton as we will review later. And you can see on my Instagram.
[01:04:56.780 --> 01:04:58.620]  Now, I don't know if I went overboard,
[01:04:58.660 --> 01:05:00.700]  but I think my diversity is right fucking.
[01:05:02.660 --> 01:05:06.460]  I went to five different locations to look at soil that was in my area,
[01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:10.140]  because again, shout out to all you guys making that great soil out there,
[01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:11.060]  but it doesn't come to me.
[01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:16.700]  Shipping and receiving is the most expensive part about buying soil.
[01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:20.380]  So you got to plan properly or mix it yourself and test it, you know.
[01:05:20.860 --> 01:05:25.180]  And that's, I did finally find a place two days ago and,
[01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:30.300]  places up here in the suburbs called Midwest Organics.
[01:05:31.020 --> 01:05:34.860]  And he's OMRI certified, he's organic certified,
[01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:38.340]  he's everything you want to be when you go there, you want to eat the dirt.
[01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:43.140]  It smells so good. There's a different facility, very similar,
[01:05:43.380 --> 01:05:46.580]  but obviously not the same. On my reports,
[01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:51.340]  I called it Abbott Labs because it's by Abbott Labs and it smelled like urinal.
[01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:54.940]  You know, he's just running too hot. He's trying to cook shit.
[01:05:54.980 --> 01:05:57.780]  The smoke fields are unbelievable coming off his piles.
[01:05:58.420 --> 01:06:01.060]  And from what I learned with Leighton, it's just not the way.
[01:06:01.460 --> 01:06:03.980]  So waiting for his soil tests,
[01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:08.460]  I have some other really good material that is directly from a
[01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:11.140]  metal from Leighton's comments,
[01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:15.100]  real high on silt and real high on clay.
[01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:20.100]  So that's going to be my layer right over my rock bed. And you know,
[01:06:20.420 --> 01:06:24.660]  like you said, built properly with the compounds in there properly with soil
[01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:28.140]  tests, I see no reason for failure.
[01:06:29.180 --> 01:06:33.820]  I don't want to fail, but out of bottles,
[01:06:34.260 --> 01:06:36.940]  how many times have you guys failed? I've failed.
[01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:40.420]  You put the wrong fucking thing in. Some strain doesn't want it.
[01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:44.940]  Shit flips over and just one inoculation of
[01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:48.660]  Jadam micro solution.
[01:06:48.940 --> 01:06:52.740]  And these plants express things even with salts in them.
[01:06:54.340 --> 01:06:56.340]  One is trying to destroy itself.
[01:06:56.340 --> 01:07:00.700]  One's turning purple and one they're the same strain. One's just a clone.
[01:07:01.220 --> 01:07:05.140]  So again, once the lights go on, we'll go over that.
[01:07:05.180 --> 01:07:09.780]  But the ratio of clone from seed
[01:07:11.180 --> 01:07:15.300]  is a discussion and an argument that everyone watching this program will have
[01:07:15.300 --> 01:07:18.060]  forever. And I will say this,
[01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:23.900]  anyone growing from a clone is growing for profit and there's
[01:07:23.900 --> 01:07:28.780]  nothing wrong with that. It's because of the consistency that it brings.
[01:07:29.300 --> 01:07:33.260]  But on my level with four fucking plants, you really think I'm going to clone?
[01:07:33.260 --> 01:07:35.740]  I don't want diversity. I want some different flavors.
[01:07:36.140 --> 01:07:38.620]  Look at the same thing for God knows how long.
[01:07:39.420 --> 01:07:43.980]  Yeah. Really depends on your goals. I think, you know, are you like somebody,
[01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:45.780]  like me, you know,
[01:07:45.780 --> 01:07:50.180]  I need a consistent strain that's going to produce, you know,
[01:07:50.180 --> 01:07:53.820]  for solventless, you know, that's what I, that's what I use.
[01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:57.380]  That's what I maintain. So, you know, every year when I go to grow,
[01:07:57.380 --> 01:08:01.420]  I don't have the ability of maintaining the same strains and a mother crop and
[01:08:01.420 --> 01:08:03.220]  stuff like that. So, you know,
[01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:06.140]  I've got to go off of what I can get here in California,
[01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:10.020]  which has changed dramatically in the last couple of years with what's available.
[01:08:10.020 --> 01:08:11.980]  And, you know, we used to have people will run up,
[01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:14.500]  walk up to our door with trays of clones and,
[01:08:14.860 --> 01:08:17.780]  and be given away stuff and everything like that. Just it's,
[01:08:17.820 --> 01:08:21.580]  the climate's changed so drastically here in California. It's like, you know,
[01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:25.980]  feast or famine at some points. And for me, it's like, I need a wedding cake.
[01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:29.500]  I need something with cake in it. I need something that's going to just dump,
[01:08:29.740 --> 01:08:34.460]  but also produce and do great up here in the Hills of California. So, you know,
[01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:35.340]  it's, it's,
[01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:39.340]  I think everybody's goals are a little bit different and everybody's situations
[01:08:39.340 --> 01:08:41.900]  are a little bit different. Me personally,
[01:08:41.900 --> 01:08:46.620]  I've had a horrible experience with seeds the last four or five times that I've
[01:08:46.620 --> 01:08:50.620]  done it. And I've had some of the most amazing sources from all kinds of
[01:08:50.620 --> 01:08:54.060]  different things. So it's just my personal bad luck.
[01:08:54.060 --> 01:08:58.060]  It just sucks with seeds compared to I give the same seeds to my brother-in-law
[01:08:58.060 --> 01:09:00.060]  and he does great with them and, and, you know,
[01:09:00.060 --> 01:09:03.060]  see our family grow and just kills it. So, um,
[01:09:03.100 --> 01:09:06.180]  everybody's experience is a little bit different and everybody's situations a
[01:09:06.180 --> 01:09:10.220]  little bit different and stuff. And, um, I'm a clone guy.
[01:09:10.260 --> 01:09:12.580]  So I just wanted to point that out real quick, just because that's,
[01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:15.420]  that's what kind of works for me. And, and I, I, you know,
[01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:18.260]  everybody's situation is a little bit different. Um,
[01:09:18.660 --> 01:09:21.100]  but my situation is different cause I'm here in California too.
[01:09:21.100 --> 01:09:23.940]  So I know the availability of clones and what we can trust, you know,
[01:09:23.940 --> 01:09:26.860]  is totally different from stuff that people have in other States. So
[01:09:27.180 --> 01:09:29.900]  for us, for us on the medical end, especially in Illinois,
[01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:35.340]  no seed sales, no clone sales.
[01:09:35.940 --> 01:09:40.940]  The first time I actually met someone from a genetics company was this year at
[01:09:40.940 --> 01:09:43.700]  Canicon, uh, Elevate Tom.
[01:09:44.460 --> 01:09:47.740]  I've been growing his product for four years.
[01:09:47.780 --> 01:09:51.660]  I got some of his seeds from the seed bank in Michigan because I had to drive
[01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:55.140]  there to get them. And, uh, finally they'll mail to you.
[01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:56.740]  But
[01:09:58.700 --> 01:09:59.860]  Tom will mail to you.
[01:10:00.620 --> 01:10:03.940]  Kelly Connections will mail to you and I've received products from both of them.
[01:10:04.180 --> 01:10:07.740]  So anybody in Illinois, those are two companies I deal with.
[01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:11.660]  I know Peter has a, uh, an outlet here. He has a lot of, uh,
[01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:15.740]  stuff on his DAGA site, but like you just said, Tyler,
[01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:20.340]  you're blinded. You're blinded by what strain is what,
[01:10:20.380 --> 01:10:21.740]  what's going to grow best for you.
[01:10:21.780 --> 01:10:25.700]  So you just really got to make a decision on the information like I did.
[01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:30.140]  And you know, for, for, I will say this for flour,
[01:10:30.140 --> 01:10:33.780]  pressing gorilla cookies and gelato mo kicks ass over chem.
[01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:35.580]  But for my dry sift,
[01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:40.740]  I'm dry sifting cat because it's what's best for me. But guess what?
[01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:44.780]  They're both in my catalog. And right now I'm looking for more terpenes.
[01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:47.100]  Uh, on my Instagram,
[01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:51.620]  you'll find that I did an outside grow of gorilla cookies and an inside grow
[01:10:52.580 --> 01:10:57.500]  outside came in at 30% and inside came in at
[01:10:57.500 --> 01:11:02.180]  28% and inside had twice the amount of turkeys.
[01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:07.220]  So as I did this, I learned that, you know,
[01:11:07.260 --> 01:11:12.020]  this is why bird prefers a greenhouse bird prefers a greenhouse
[01:11:12.020 --> 01:11:16.660]  because it makes more THC and the sun does not destroy the
[01:11:16.660 --> 01:11:18.700]  turkeys. Correct. Oh, bird.
[01:11:19.700 --> 01:11:23.940]  I kind of wanted to throw it to bird on that with the question between seeds and
[01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:25.940]  clones, especially with the fact that, uh,
[01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:29.820]  you could probably dial that down a little bit by changing your harvest times,
[01:11:29.820 --> 01:11:33.220]  harvesting that, that outdoor a little bit sooner. Um,
[01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:37.220]  and could have get that express same expression, if not better outdoors,
[01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:40.180]  then you had indoors just by changing your harvest times.
[01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:43.380]  But, but if you look at the test, Tyler, I have no,
[01:11:43.420 --> 01:11:47.420]  I have absolutely no degrading at each test.
[01:11:47.980 --> 01:11:50.540]  So that tells me I didn't go too far on each one.
[01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:54.660]  And I pulled it kind of early outside was dictated by frost coming.
[01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:58.580]  And I had a couple of buds already rotting. So it had to come inside.
[01:11:58.820 --> 01:12:01.340]  I waited until what I saw and sure enough,
[01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:05.900]  pulled it right at the right time. Cause I had absolutely no THC.
[01:12:05.980 --> 01:12:10.340]  All THC is what I want. I want to be able to manipulate it after that.
[01:12:10.780 --> 01:12:12.300]  So some guys will go further.
[01:12:12.580 --> 01:12:14.780]  They want that THC because guess what?
[01:12:14.980 --> 01:12:18.140]  Some T terpenes are created after maturity.
[01:12:18.860 --> 01:12:20.660]  A lot of people don't understand that.
[01:12:21.180 --> 01:12:24.060]  And it happens within the trichome itself.
[01:12:24.380 --> 01:12:27.580]  I showed that to Bert some one fucking trichome I found.
[01:12:29.180 --> 01:12:34.140]  This trichome I put on Instagram is expressing what Jartec does when you're
[01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:35.780]  turning, uh,
[01:12:36.260 --> 01:12:41.260]  hash oil into diamonds and sauce and butter and all those definitions.
[01:12:42.380 --> 01:12:43.620]  I have no idea what they do.
[01:12:44.540 --> 01:12:47.380]  I'm not buying that shit out here because it's all made with the solvent.
[01:12:47.660 --> 01:12:50.100]  If I was near him, I'd be buying that bird.
[01:12:50.220 --> 01:12:54.740]  I'd have that container in my box right now, but it's not here.
[01:12:55.260 --> 01:12:58.620]  So we do with what we can, you know,
[01:12:58.660 --> 01:13:02.740]  and I've just found out that when no solventless products are available at all,
[01:13:02.780 --> 01:13:06.500]  I'm on my own. You guys are on your own a lot.
[01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:12.180]  So, uh, in here is five different strains from Elevate.
[01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:16.260]  I am testing them for them, make sure they're stable,
[01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:19.300]  report back what I got. And when I report back,
[01:13:19.780 --> 01:13:22.140]  what I got to Tom with Gorilla Cookies, he goes,
[01:13:23.660 --> 01:13:28.460]  it's too much information, too much information. This is the light.
[01:13:28.460 --> 01:13:30.540]  This is the time. This is everything you fucking need.
[01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:33.740]  Everybody should be doing this. So nobody has to do this again.
[01:13:34.740 --> 01:13:39.660]  You should have catalogs of this information. Origo Labs does this.
[01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:43.540]  They asked me, who's the cultivar? How long did you grow it?
[01:13:43.580 --> 01:13:46.980]  How did you grow it? Everything that they've done for Illinois,
[01:13:46.980 --> 01:13:51.420]  they have on catalog. You want to see what fails? Call Origo Labs.
[01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:55.140]  They're going to know by everybody growing and having them tested.
[01:13:55.420 --> 01:13:58.940]  So as I started to look at that, I asked them that question.
[01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:03.740]  Nobody's running this shit out here. Nobody's washing hash.
[01:14:03.780 --> 01:14:08.740]  Nobody's making hash. So there's no hash strains being tested at Origo. Again,
[01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:10.980]  I'm on my own, like Bert.
[01:14:11.940 --> 01:14:15.260]  He just needs to take his eyes and go look at the weed and touch it and go,
[01:14:15.260 --> 01:14:18.380]  yep, yep, yep. That's what it's going to do. Cause he knows.
[01:14:20.300 --> 01:14:22.300]  All right. I'd like to ask Bert a question again.
[01:14:22.300 --> 01:14:24.380]  So what are your thoughts brother on the, on the,
[01:14:24.540 --> 01:14:26.220]  the cloning versus the seeds?
[01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:30.580]  You know, I think you're gonna,
[01:14:32.380 --> 01:14:37.540]  you're going to have a stronger clone, I mean, a stronger seed plant,
[01:14:37.620 --> 01:14:41.260]  but as far as the resin,
[01:14:42.460 --> 01:14:46.340]  it's, it's, it's a very similar quality.
[01:14:46.340 --> 01:14:49.900]  I would say hard to distinguish difference if it's grown correctly.
[01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:53.380]  It's more about how long it's grown, where it's grown,
[01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:56.500]  what it's grown with is what is the issue.
[01:14:57.340 --> 01:15:02.340]  You can get a lot of good consistency out of cloning and you also could have
[01:15:03.140 --> 01:15:07.860]  issues that are come from cloning those breakdowns of genetics and other just
[01:15:07.860 --> 01:15:10.340]  defects that come from cloning. But you know,
[01:15:12.020 --> 01:15:14.460]  that would be a negative side to cloning, I would say,
[01:15:14.460 --> 01:15:17.180]  but when you manipulate it correctly,
[01:15:17.220 --> 01:15:19.420]  the farms know how to deal with that kind of stuff.
[01:15:19.420 --> 01:15:24.420]  I see a lot of really good product come from cloning and seeds as well.
[01:15:25.140 --> 01:15:27.580]  I don't really think that that's the distinguishing factor.
[01:15:27.580 --> 01:15:30.100]  It's just more of what variables that you're going to be dealing with.
[01:15:30.940 --> 01:15:35.940]  That makes you come upon what decision you need to do for your farm is cloning
[01:15:36.180 --> 01:15:39.740]  or seeding. It's really what it breaks down to.
[01:15:39.740 --> 01:15:44.100]  I think more people shout out to Chad Westport was talking about this.
[01:15:44.820 --> 01:15:47.220]  But what do you guys think about genetic drift?
[01:15:47.220 --> 01:15:51.580]  If you are cloning at a heavy level, do you feel like that does exist? Tyler?
[01:15:53.140 --> 01:15:56.100]  I think that's plant health. You know,
[01:15:56.100 --> 01:15:59.980]  I know a lot of facilities that are using tissue testing or sap testing and
[01:16:00.380 --> 01:16:04.260]  making sure that their moms are healthy and at the proper level that they need
[01:16:04.260 --> 01:16:05.100]  to be.
[01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:08.700]  And there's a lot of people in home growers too that are using science to make
[01:16:08.700 --> 01:16:12.100]  sure that things are as checked as they could be,
[01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:15.140]  as nice as they could be before going into those situations.
[01:16:15.140 --> 01:16:17.700]  And healthy moms put out healthy clones,
[01:16:17.900 --> 01:16:21.500]  healthy moms put out healthy seeds. So, you know,
[01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:25.700]  I just noticed a big difference between healthy genetics and unhealthy genetics.
[01:16:26.180 --> 01:16:29.100]  And obviously in the benefit of microbes,
[01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:32.060]  powering those forward faster as well.
[01:16:33.180 --> 01:16:37.500]  I will second that Tyler, because as much as I say about that,
[01:16:37.500 --> 01:16:40.900]  Ken, when I try and make it,
[01:16:41.780 --> 01:16:42.820]  when I try and clone it,
[01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:48.900]  ones and threes, my mother was not,
[01:16:49.700 --> 01:16:54.700]  my mother was not producing humic acid because it is not in living soil.
[01:16:55.140 --> 01:16:59.340]  So if you guys out there are frustrated with cloning doesn't work and you're
[01:16:59.340 --> 01:17:00.780]  growing in nutrients,
[01:17:01.180 --> 01:17:05.260]  it's because your soil and your product isn't creating humic acid to be able to
[01:17:05.260 --> 01:17:07.780]  make the clone happen on the mother.
[01:17:08.780 --> 01:17:12.700]  Uh, Leighton, I showed him this plant. I'm like,
[01:17:12.700 --> 01:17:14.180]  what the fuck do I do with this?
[01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:17.300]  He throw some humic acid and fucking kelp at that thing.
[01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:21.540]  It's going to come back in four minutes. I didn't know that.
[01:17:21.740 --> 01:17:24.420]  When I bring in a strain into my garden,
[01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:28.300]  I've never forced it. If it doesn't clone, you're fucking out of here.
[01:17:28.580 --> 01:17:32.500]  I don't care. I shouldn't have to force feed things to it.
[01:17:33.140 --> 01:17:36.020]  But again, it wasn't the genetics. It wasn't,
[01:17:36.100 --> 01:17:39.700]  it was my fucking shit soil not producing humic acid.
[01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:43.500]  So learn, learn, learn. It's,
[01:17:43.580 --> 01:17:47.620]  these are all gold nuggets for me and I've been growing outside for years.
[01:17:47.660 --> 01:17:50.220]  And just the definition,
[01:17:50.260 --> 01:17:52.260]  it's the definition of leaf mold soil.
[01:17:52.700 --> 01:17:56.700]  When I was in third grade and I was taught how to compost out in the wild,
[01:17:57.220 --> 01:18:00.220]  it was just called the good stuff. You scrape the leaves off,
[01:18:00.220 --> 01:18:02.260]  you scrape the two fucking inches of soil out,
[01:18:02.420 --> 01:18:05.140]  you put it where you were going to grow and the shit grew like magic.
[01:18:05.340 --> 01:18:07.940]  I didn't know it was microbes. I just thought it was fertilizer.
[01:18:08.740 --> 01:18:13.300]  Now it's what you learn on this program to me that is key. And you know,
[01:18:13.300 --> 01:18:17.620]  it's all you guys. Hopefully everything I'm showing you here. Yeah,
[01:18:17.780 --> 01:18:21.340]  I've done my thing, but this program is invaluable.
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:27.360]  Clearly you need a little bit of weed.
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:33.640]  Got some new stuff coming from grassroots guys.
[01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:39.360]  There you go. Soil life, new grassroots logo.
[01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:44.600]  That's some cool stuff going on there. What else you got going on?
[01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:48.120]  Taller beds, taller beds.
[01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:52.720]  What was that? What about trellises?
[01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:56.680]  Oh man, the trellis game is just getting pretty intense.
[01:18:56.680 --> 01:19:01.600]  We've had a really cool grower that you guys should have on the show called
[01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:04.760]  Danny Janes from Collective Elevation in Montana.
[01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:09.160]  They're really doing it up amazing out there in Montana guys,
[01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:13.200]  some really quality stuff. So maybe, you know, if you love the show Yellowstone,
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:16.080]  there's also a really good weed grown out there in Montana as well.
[01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:19.680]  But Danny Janes at Collective Elevation,
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.320]  he's really innovative with his braised beds.
[01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:26.960]  He put an insert inside the top trellis piece to reduce the
[01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:30.640]  width down to, I think, three quarters inch, which is pretty, you know,
[01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:32.280]  pretty basic,
[01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:36.840]  but you can put a metal pole inside of the trellis area and go vertical with
[01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:40.400]  these metal poles. So that's a pretty cool innovation there.
[01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:45.240]  Cause they remove the metal poles and the metal slides in and out of the PVC a
[01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:49.440]  little bit easier and makes it a little bit more sturdier than pipe.
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:54.400]  And we also have people that are putting metal inside of the PVC.
[01:19:54.840 --> 01:19:56.480]  Yep. That's Collective Elevation there.
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:01.160]  Those are some 40 foot beds that they're running right there.
[01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:06.440]  Those are on some benches that they have there with some,
[01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:07.960]  obviously some LED lights.
[01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:11.000]  But this is going to run 365 days of the year,
[01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.520]  even if there's three to six feet of snow outside.
[01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:17.560]  We have them experimenting with the sleeves.
[01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:21.200]  We actually did a special thing with Danny there.
[01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:24.920]  We did some three gallon living soil pots with a mesh bottom,
[01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:27.640]  with a mesh that kind of looks like a trucker's hat.
[01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:32.280]  So got Danny experimenting with some cool things there
[01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:35.000]  in their testing side of things, but
[01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:37.600]  they're, you know,
[01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:40.840]  no bottles kind of company.
[01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:45.480]  So everything that they use there is fermented or they've made themselves or
[01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:49.960]  they compost all of that soil. There's Kiss Organic Soil,
[01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:50.920]  the Kiss Mix.
[01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:57.080]  And they're killing it out there in Montana. Got their own
[01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:00.440]  dispensary.
[01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:04.880]  It's definitely a cool setup. Some really nice people.
[01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:10.120]  They did, if you scroll back further in their feed,
[01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:14.800]  they built their own support frames for their raised beds.
[01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:17.160]  They did like a liner way back in the day.
[01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:22.040]  And actually the coolest way ever of filling raised beds is this video right
[01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:25.240]  here. So that's Harbor Freight Scaffolding.
[01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:30.560]  They cut a little hole in the scaffolding and then they're going to cut a big
[01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:35.160]  square in the bottom of that soil mass and just drop that soil down in there.
[01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:40.440]  Definitely one of the most effortless ways of filling raised beds in a facility
[01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:41.280]  that I've ever seen.
[01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:45.480]  There's a nice goal.
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:50.200]  That's brilliant. Cause usually you just pay a bunch of people to shovel that in.
[01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:54.760]  In the damage that they're causing to the soil in those situations, you know,
[01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:58.600]  compared to this is going to be minimal damage to any, you know,
[01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:02.920]  obviously all the good, amazing stuff that Kiss Organics puts into their soil,
[01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:06.240]  you know, that gets them all this great recognition around the United States.
[01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:07.520]  You know,
[01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:10.720]  this is probably the smoothest way of making sure that that's going to be
[01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:15.120]  properly done and properly put into that soil and get inoculated too.
[01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:16.360]  Yeah.
[01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:20.000]  I believe those are called bakers and they're used to do suspended ceiling work.
[01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:22.360]  So if someone wants to buy one, that's where to look.
[01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:25.400]  Yeah. It's like a scaffolding kind of thing.
[01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:27.480]  Can you rent those Layton?
[01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:31.000]  Yeah, you can rent them, but they, they charge so much.
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:35.080]  They're better off to buy one, you know, and then sell it to someone else.
[01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:38.760]  So they're like 200 bucks.
[01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:41.520]  You go to Harbor Freight and pick them up for a couple hundred bucks.
[01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:43.280]  It's definitely great thing to have around,
[01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:46.320]  especially if you're going to hang any D Hughes or get up there and do some,
[01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:48.120]  some work. It's the safest way to go.
[01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:51.360]  Yeah. And you don't have to build scaffolding.
[01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:53.960]  You just roll it right over the top of the beds, which was great.
[01:22:56.920 --> 01:22:57.760]  But yeah.
[01:22:57.800 --> 01:23:00.960]  One thing that's getting really popular with grassroots is we're doing a lot of
[01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:05.080]  liner projects, a next gen greenhouse company.
[01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:09.520]  They build rolling benches and their benches have sidewalls on them.
[01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:13.760]  So recently we did a big build out for seven, 10 labs in Oakland,
[01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:18.640]  where we just did a bunch of liners for them that sit within the cages and the
[01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:23.480]  liner goes up and over the cage and secures the cage with a grommet.
[01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:27.080]  So that's been a thing that's popping up in,
[01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:31.920]  we've got three or four projects in the works right now, Michigan, Montana,
[01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:34.760]  I believe even like Minnesota or something like that,
[01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:38.120]  where we're doing some big greenhouses and those liner projects.
[01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:42.680]  So no PVC pipe frame. It's just, we're baking a liner to fit within a cage.
[01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:44.760]  So that's fun, easy stuff for us.
[01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:50.600]  That's a perfect segue to actually show you how I built my, uh,
[01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:55.320]  my little system here and what I'm going to do. Will we build within rock today?
[01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:57.920]  We're an hour and a half in, I don't know if there's enough time,
[01:23:57.920 --> 01:24:00.320]  but I want to at least show you everything I'm going to do.
[01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:02.720]  And if you have any points on it, that'd be great.
[01:24:04.120 --> 01:24:07.120]  So you got us up Peter on the remote camera.
[01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:11.880]  Okay. There you go. Okay.
[01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:17.280]  So what I did was go to, uh,
[01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:22.880]  and I know it's a big deal as far as grow stores and salt and everything,
[01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:27.120]  but I gotta tell you, without my local grow store,
[01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:31.800]  there's certain parts I get that are in my grow that I can only get from them.
[01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:36.880]  Yeah. There's other grow stores in the area, but a big grow hydroponics,
[01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:39.560]  Mike out in Crystal Lake, Lake in the Hills.
[01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:44.800]  He only deals with growing. It's not hops. It's not all that stuff.
[01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:47.760]  So I got this liner from him. Okay.
[01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:53.280]  This is a plastic skid that I had at work that I cut because I want to have
[01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:54.160]  true drain.
[01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:59.200]  I don't want to have the bed sitting in the depths of the liner to create
[01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:04.400]  mold. I have a long tube go into my utility room,
[01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:06.480]  or like when I built the, uh,
[01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:10.480]  then I got 25 foot hose that'll go outside and it's going to be in constant
[01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:14.880]  flow. Got these from Menards. Okay. The weight,
[01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:18.720]  300 pounds. I know I'm on cube. It's only 800 pounds of dirt.
[01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:22.320]  Three quarter inch piece of plywood that'll all sit on.
[01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:27.040]  And then this guy goes right on top. So with that being said,
[01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:28.560]  what am I doing wrong?
[01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:33.200]  I would say, you know, I think you're sacrificing some,
[01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:37.520]  some headroom by having that plastic pallet in there. Um,
[01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:41.920]  besides a plastic pallet, I recommend people use a gravel,
[01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:47.160]  hydroton, uh, pumice. Um, so if you were running into,
[01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:50.200]  you know, some height issues there, um, you know,
[01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:53.560]  you could change those plastic pallets out to something a little bit smaller,
[01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:56.320]  uh, and still give you that even drainage.
[01:25:57.320 --> 01:26:01.640]  I can cut those plastic pallets and just cut the top one inch layer off of it.
[01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:06.680]  So if you see it, it's a plastic pallet I cut apart, you know what I'm saying?
[01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:10.560]  Well, one thing you should think about too, is we also, uh,
[01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:14.720]  want to create a spot and a home for roots to go below the bed,
[01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:19.720]  uh, because roots are going to pass through this fabric and can grow past the
[01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:23.800]  bed and through there. So if you had like a grow media below that,
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:28.760]  you would have an additional home for those roots and those microbes, um,
[01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:33.280]  and just another ecosystem kind of below your bed. Um,
[01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:36.120]  but also allowing for very, very even drainage,
[01:26:36.140 --> 01:26:38.880]  having that rock below the bed, not within the bed.
[01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:41.200]  I'm creating, uh,
[01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:44.800]  an inch and a half minus rock bed system.
[01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:47.040]  I don't think too much is going to grow past that.
[01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:49.560]  Is it latent or won't it die off once it hits that rock?
[01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:54.760]  No, roots will grow right into the E-zone. That's, that's not an issue at all.
[01:26:55.200 --> 01:27:00.160]  Again, though, remember it is designed to be a sand filter so that it doesn't
[01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:04.720]  allow excess organic matter to get down in there because if that happens,
[01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:08.760]  it will go anaerobic. But a few roots getting down in there, it's not a big deal.
[01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:10.040]  That'll create aeration.
[01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:13.920]  And I'm sure the roots will eventually turn into organic matter,
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:15.240]  but we're talking in a long,
[01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:18.640]  long time from now before you ever have to worry about that.
[01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:21.640]  But I do agree with what he's saying is I would just,
[01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:26.400]  I would turn that whole pallet, um, like fill the,
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:31.520]  fill the ripples with sand so that when you put your, uh,
[01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:36.120]  bed in there, it's as low as it possibly can. Um,
[01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:40.360]  it's sitting on solid ground and if roots do pass through the bottom of the
[01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:43.760]  fabric, so be it. They're just going to push it, push their way into the sand.
[01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:46.760]  Um, and that's, that's the other key to the whole,
[01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:51.640]  like horizontal soil system is understanding that you need a way to monitor
[01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:53.320]  how much water is in there.
[01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:57.360]  And that's why I always say use a rubber roofing or some kind of liner,
[01:27:58.040 --> 01:28:01.400]  that's as the same height as your E-horizon.
[01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:03.560]  So if you've over watered your E-horizon,
[01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:06.600]  the water's going to ooze out or you're going to see you're somehow,
[01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:09.400]  you're going to notice that you've added too much water.
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.160]  There was one gentleman that hit me up and said, basically,
[01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:16.400]  he filled his E-horizon twice in the season and that was it.
[01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:20.960]  Never watered it again. So it's, there's definitely some, uh, you know,
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:22.760]  some benefits to using that system.
[01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:25.200]  And that's where there's a system out there.
[01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:28.040]  I spoke with a gentleman out of Chicago at Mike's store, OctoPot.
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:34.000]  OctoPot is basically a static lower water reservoir and then has soil on top.
[01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:42.280]  Same system as, as horizontal. It takes everything up.
[01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:47.480]  Should I be having large rain events from the top or should I be having large
[01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:48.760]  rain events from the bottom?
[01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:53.440]  And that's why I wanted to make a flood tray if I needed to. I mean,
[01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:57.080]  do I sink that down in there so I can just flood the rocks and then drain it?
[01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:02.240]  Yeah, absolutely. Think nature. So a huge rain event comes by.
[01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:04.520]  Everything gets saturated.
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:09.240]  And then as that rain cloud moves laterally, horizontally, wherever,
[01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:12.760]  up, uphill, a day later, two days later,
[01:29:12.760 --> 01:29:14.480]  you're going to have a high groundwater event.
[01:29:14.920 --> 01:29:19.000]  So there's no reason why not to do both. Again, diversity, diversity.
[01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:23.880]  This bucket here, it's from a distance, but this is a 13 gallon bucket.
[01:29:24.840 --> 01:29:27.600]  Has a pump in it, has an aerator pump in it. Okay.
[01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:32.720]  I've made this the blue mat reservoir.
[01:29:35.650 --> 01:29:40.290]  So it can be a constant feed or I can do a rain event in each plant that I have.
[01:29:40.290 --> 01:29:45.370]  Eventually one of these will be the bed, but I can reach this from a chair.
[01:29:45.570 --> 01:29:50.490]  It's gravity fed from my hydrologic. It's all gravity.
[01:29:50.490 --> 01:29:52.050]  I don't have any pumps in here.
[01:29:52.090 --> 01:29:56.930]  Blue Mat wanted to sell me a $600 system or something for five plants,
[01:29:57.290 --> 01:30:01.730]  a two by four bed, not feasible. Gravity should be able to do all of this.
[01:30:02.050 --> 01:30:06.290]  Shidam container, hydrologic RO feed,
[01:30:07.410 --> 01:30:11.210]  gravity, no pumps. I don't want to waste electricity to do my plants.
[01:30:12.450 --> 01:30:16.050]  After the experience of the Blue Mat in the last week,
[01:30:16.610 --> 01:30:18.410]  I feel that it's for me,
[01:30:18.410 --> 01:30:22.610]  unless I'm going on vacation or something to monitor and always have water.
[01:30:23.970 --> 01:30:25.890]  It's killing the one plant, too wet.
[01:30:25.890 --> 01:30:29.850]  I've tried dial it in the standing drip minus a click or two.
[01:30:30.170 --> 01:30:33.490]  So I think the Blue Mat system is really not for container plants.
[01:30:34.850 --> 01:30:35.810]  It's more for a bed.
[01:30:35.850 --> 01:30:40.330]  It's going to be a bed maintenance system compared to these containers are just
[01:30:40.330 --> 01:30:43.730]  flooding themselves. It's a fine line. It's like racing a Lamborghini.
[01:30:43.730 --> 01:30:45.010]  It's just not going to catch it.
[01:30:47.370 --> 01:30:49.650]  Yeah, that's a, that's a nice, honest opinion.
[01:30:49.650 --> 01:30:54.290]  I have opinions on Blue Mats myself as well. I just feel like sometimes though,
[01:30:54.290 --> 01:30:58.530]  that is with user error as well. I'm trying to dial that stuff in.
[01:30:59.810 --> 01:31:03.370]  There's three that are rocking and there's pros and cons of pretty much anything.
[01:31:04.810 --> 01:31:09.250]  No problem. So there's fibers in there, but then there's some tenors in there.
[01:31:09.250 --> 01:31:12.970]  And I've never ever in salt world,
[01:31:13.170 --> 01:31:16.370]  it's four or five gallons, four or five months. Hey, rocket.
[01:31:17.090 --> 01:31:18.930]  This is different with it.
[01:31:18.970 --> 01:31:23.130]  I have each of those systems with horizons in them. There's rock.
[01:31:23.890 --> 01:31:28.890]  I'm trying to learn that on five plants in there before I do this with a gravel
[01:31:29.050 --> 01:31:33.650]  pit rock, basically. So with gravel pit rock,
[01:31:33.810 --> 01:31:34.890]  you're going to learn a lot.
[01:31:34.930 --> 01:31:38.530]  You're just basically not going to feed it any minerals or any nutrients.
[01:31:38.530 --> 01:31:43.530]  You've got to stick to sea salt, but fucking Pete and ocean forest and lock up.
[01:31:44.290 --> 01:31:46.090]  I mean, you'll see the plants here in a little bit,
[01:31:46.090 --> 01:31:47.210]  in about another 20 minutes,
[01:31:47.210 --> 01:31:50.410]  the light will go on and I'll show you everything going on. But,
[01:31:50.610 --> 01:31:51.450]  uh,
[01:31:52.610 --> 01:31:57.610]  no blue mat for me unless I'm going on vacation or I have a living bed dialed in
[01:31:57.890 --> 01:32:00.250]  so perfect that every nutrient is in it.
[01:32:00.290 --> 01:32:04.370]  And I'll do that later when I have the bed active.
[01:32:07.530 --> 01:32:09.690]  Well, mats are notoriously challenging to manage,
[01:32:09.690 --> 01:32:12.290]  but once you get the hang of them, they are a breeze.
[01:32:12.530 --> 01:32:16.650]  Do you run containers, James, like a five gallon or a 10 gallon?
[01:32:17.650 --> 01:32:18.450]  Well, with that statement,
[01:32:18.450 --> 01:32:21.650]  I feel like if you're running a living soil system and it's a five gallon and 10
[01:32:21.650 --> 01:32:22.730]  gallon, that's not really,
[01:32:23.010 --> 01:32:25.450]  I don't feel like you're setting yourself up for success there.
[01:32:26.010 --> 01:32:30.130]  Uh, definitely would be like a 25 or maybe a 20 gallon for a female.
[01:32:30.170 --> 01:32:32.690]  I say it. Okay. You say it, especially you, Brian,
[01:32:32.690 --> 01:32:34.930]  because you've dealt with some of these commercial drills.
[01:32:35.170 --> 01:32:39.370]  I've heard you say it several times, but you guys,
[01:32:39.370 --> 01:32:42.610]  you gotta be stubborn. You gotta prove it to yourself.
[01:32:42.610 --> 01:32:44.410]  You gotta learn on that smaller shit.
[01:32:44.450 --> 01:32:48.890]  You can hear someone say it, but for a $7 or a $10 pot from Tyler,
[01:32:48.890 --> 01:32:52.370]  why the fuck would I not learn it on a smaller pot?
[01:32:52.370 --> 01:32:55.570]  So I want to learn on the hardest thing.
[01:32:55.890 --> 01:33:00.610]  That way when I'm dialed in, I not worry about it.
[01:33:01.530 --> 01:33:03.290]  I think with a smaller pot,
[01:33:03.290 --> 01:33:07.410]  I'm kind of concerned about nutrient availability constant with the plant and
[01:33:07.410 --> 01:33:10.810]  the plant kind of like eating up all the available nutrients within that
[01:33:10.810 --> 01:33:14.250]  container. So I think with those smaller containers,
[01:33:14.290 --> 01:33:18.290]  you still kind of do have to rely a little bit more on some nutrient feedings at
[01:33:18.290 --> 01:33:20.770]  a certain point, just because, you know,
[01:33:20.770 --> 01:33:23.410]  that plant has the possibility of eating up all that,
[01:33:23.810 --> 01:33:27.650]  that food that's in the kitchen because the kitchen is so small is really what
[01:33:27.650 --> 01:33:28.490]  we need to look at.
[01:33:28.810 --> 01:33:31.850]  At that point, would you be going with nutrient wells,
[01:33:31.930 --> 01:33:34.530]  or would you be rely on a foliar at that point?
[01:33:35.370 --> 01:33:39.930]  I would be doing weekly root drenches and I would be doing a weekly foliar
[01:33:39.930 --> 01:33:43.250]  sprays, um, even up to, you know,
[01:33:43.250 --> 01:33:47.170]  probably week three, four flower. Um, you know,
[01:33:47.170 --> 01:33:49.770]  I'm pretty heavy on our microbial, um,
[01:33:50.130 --> 01:33:54.330]  inoculants and microbial foods, uh, throughout that process. Uh,
[01:33:54.370 --> 01:33:57.410]  my personally and a lot of our customers have been very successful with that
[01:33:57.410 --> 01:34:02.490]  process. Um, especially with, you know, a living soil system that's been, uh,
[01:34:02.530 --> 01:34:04.810]  properly, um, uh, you know,
[01:34:04.810 --> 01:34:08.770]  soil tested and amended to those minerals to be on all those right levels.
[01:34:09.050 --> 01:34:11.850]  You get the microbes in there and they kind of just go crazy and have a great
[01:34:11.850 --> 01:34:15.330]  time and you know, the party starts, but, um, yeah.
[01:34:16.490 --> 01:34:17.490]  Well, let's, uh,
[01:34:18.250 --> 01:34:22.130]  fire up that remote camera again and at least show you guys what I have
[01:34:23.010 --> 01:34:26.610]  collected. Um, hopefully it's correct. I think,
[01:34:26.810 --> 01:34:30.690]  I think with Layton's guidance, I got it. So let's check this out.
[01:34:35.710 --> 01:34:40.110]  Weezer. There is no right and wrong brother. It's just effort.
[01:34:40.950 --> 01:34:45.880]  And you got to unmute that mic so we can hear you.
[01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:57.520]  Or maybe someone else can narrate.
[01:34:58.040 --> 01:35:02.360]  All right. So basically what I did was I sent him out to all these different
[01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:06.080]  places to collect, um, different components.
[01:35:06.080 --> 01:35:10.280]  And one of the key things to understanding is that each color represents a
[01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:12.280]  different mineral makeup.
[01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:16.400]  And therefore that's why he got all those different colored rocks as well as
[01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:18.000]  those different kinds of clay.
[01:35:18.040 --> 01:35:20.440]  And then he's going to blend them all together. Um,
[01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:24.840]  so basically he's recreating what would happen in a, uh,
[01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:27.720]  a river situation and erosion situation.
[01:35:27.720 --> 01:35:30.840]  So you're getting all of those different variables. And again,
[01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:33.880]  it all goes back to diversity, diversity, more diversity.
[01:35:33.880 --> 01:35:36.400]  You have the better chance of actually getting.
[01:35:39.960 --> 01:35:43.880]  Okay. You should be able to hear me now. I touched the mic. Now this is, uh,
[01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:47.600]  now this is a metal soil here, Layton.
[01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:49.240]  This is our first test where,
[01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:52.560]  when I saw you first and sent you the soil report, you're like,
[01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:56.760]  that's perfect spot. And it's missing potassium.
[01:35:56.960 --> 01:36:01.680]  So that tells me that a JMS solution or some type of Korean farming stuff can
[01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:06.240]  take care of it. Well, we send it away to Logan labs. Guess what?
[01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:07.720]  It's nothing but clay.
[01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:12.320]  So that's going to be my lower layer mixed with some sand.
[01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:15.000]  And when you get this wet, I mean, it, it sticks.
[01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:19.840]  So that brought me to my huge search for
[01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:22.920]  organic soil out there at Midwest organics.
[01:36:24.560 --> 01:36:27.120]  It's brought me to this on the left.
[01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:31.880]  We have his top soil that's blended with what he calls an organic mix.
[01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:33.040]  If you look at his website
[01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:38.280]  and it sticks, it's not wet and it sticks like clay.
[01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:41.800]  So that's going to need amending. Even after I get the soil report,
[01:36:42.120 --> 01:36:45.680]  that'll flood. This is his compost,
[01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:49.880]  all from food, organic matter, all natural.
[01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:52.240]  And when I stick my hand in there,
[01:36:53.920 --> 01:36:58.000]  it's a little warmer than me. So she's not done a cooking.
[01:36:58.520 --> 01:37:02.800]  I don't have reports on that yet. So I am not going to use it.
[01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:06.800]  Walk you back outside. What I am going to do with it.
[01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:13.360]  Note to everyone, you see the leaves on the ground, leave them.
[01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:16.720]  Don't mow your lawn in the fall.
[01:37:18.600 --> 01:37:23.440]  Do you have an EC pen so you can see what the EC of that compost is that you got?
[01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:27.920]  Okay. Now I can hear you guys.
[01:37:28.880 --> 01:37:30.400]  Hey Weasels, I think the...
[01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:31.640]  What was that Tyler?
[01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:36.560]  I was going to say an EC pen. Do you have an EC pen?
[01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:38.000]  So you can check the electrical con...
[01:37:39.640 --> 01:37:42.320]  The EC of that compost before you start using it.
[01:37:47.800 --> 01:37:49.000]  There's probably a delay there.
[01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:50.280]  Okay. I can't hear you.
[01:37:50.280 --> 01:37:53.560]  I can't hear you if you're using the food in your compost.
[01:37:54.200 --> 01:37:56.760]  This is that metal soil that I'll leave in my yard.
[01:38:04.530 --> 01:38:05.330]  I don't know about you guys,
[01:38:05.330 --> 01:38:09.130]  but when I'm using like food and stuff in my compost, more of like the fruits,
[01:38:09.130 --> 01:38:12.410]  that kind of stuff, it seems like fungus gnats really come through.
[01:38:13.410 --> 01:38:15.770]  Have you guys experienced any of that?
[01:38:15.770 --> 01:38:17.250]  Oh yeah, sugars.
[01:38:17.250 --> 01:38:21.490]  Okay. If you want to invest in a composter that doesn't work very well,
[01:38:21.490 --> 01:38:23.250]  buy this one from Miracle-Bro.
[01:38:25.170 --> 01:38:28.170]  It's off the land. I thought that that would work out for me.
[01:38:29.810 --> 01:38:34.050]  But these products have been in here probably two months.
[01:38:34.490 --> 01:38:37.690]  Nothing's breaking down. There's no microbes in there.
[01:38:37.730 --> 01:38:40.730]  I put leaf mold soil in there. There's a bug or two, but...
[01:38:41.730 --> 01:38:45.610]  People, that's not going to make the correct compost for you.
[01:38:48.610 --> 01:38:52.530]  The things that I've learned just by experiment, you almost, again,
[01:38:52.530 --> 01:38:56.290]  have to prove them to yourself because you're so stubborn from things that you
[01:38:56.290 --> 01:38:57.130]  learned outside.
[01:38:58.970 --> 01:39:00.890]  But I will not build this bed
[01:39:02.930 --> 01:39:04.730]  until I have everything correct.
[01:39:05.210 --> 01:39:08.770]  And that includes some type of pumice or sand.
[01:39:08.770 --> 01:39:26.950]  I kind of have a couple of questions about that layering process.
[01:39:29.470 --> 01:39:32.350]  Yeah, go for it. I think there's still some tech stuff,
[01:39:32.350 --> 01:39:34.790]  but I think either you can hear us or you're muting.
[01:39:36.310 --> 01:39:40.780]  Got it. Go ahead.
[01:39:41.180 --> 01:39:42.500]  Tyler, ask your question again, buddy.
[01:39:44.060 --> 01:39:45.380]  With that layering process,
[01:39:45.380 --> 01:39:48.740]  obviously we're getting all the parts and pieces together there and putting it
[01:39:48.740 --> 01:39:50.540]  together and creating the layers and
[01:39:51.060 --> 01:39:56.060]  putting all those different pieces in there so the plant can treat that like a
[01:39:56.060 --> 01:39:58.380]  kitchen. My one question is,
[01:39:58.380 --> 01:40:03.300]  obviously we know the microbes have to break down a lot of those elements and
[01:40:03.300 --> 01:40:07.300]  process them and poop them out before they become plant available.
[01:40:07.700 --> 01:40:11.180]  How long do we expect that process to take with this layering?
[01:40:11.220 --> 01:40:15.820]  Are we going to have to supplement them until those minerals are available to
[01:40:15.820 --> 01:40:16.660]  them?
[01:40:16.700 --> 01:40:17.540]  Um,
[01:40:17.940 --> 01:40:21.420]  that's kind of the concerns I have with that compared to just a large soil mass
[01:40:21.420 --> 01:40:24.180]  of soil that is obviously very available.
[01:40:28.540 --> 01:40:30.460]  This is what you're going to treat that bed with.
[01:40:31.620 --> 01:40:36.620]  This is on Layton's horizontal system that he did in a 30 gallon pot with Peter.
[01:40:39.140 --> 01:40:41.940]  This is your inoculant for that, from what I understand.
[01:40:43.380 --> 01:40:47.500]  Eventually all the microbes are going to do their thing just like they do on
[01:40:47.540 --> 01:40:52.500]  earth. How do microbes get down to the rock layer? Earthworms, bugs.
[01:40:53.180 --> 01:40:57.420]  This is where Brian comes in. Once my bed's built, I'm going to need earthworms,
[01:40:57.620 --> 01:40:59.740]  bread. I'm going to need isopods.
[01:41:00.460 --> 01:41:04.060]  Only thing that makes that shit down there come up is life.
[01:41:05.460 --> 01:41:09.700]  No water, no nothing is going to make it come up. You need bugs.
[01:41:10.060 --> 01:41:13.380]  So once I'm done, that's the next step, correct Layton?
[01:41:14.260 --> 01:41:19.100]  Actually, there's microbes in all of that. They're called endophytes.
[01:41:19.700 --> 01:41:22.180]  They actually live in rock, believe it or not.
[01:41:22.220 --> 01:41:27.220]  So the key is to jumpstart that bed by using products like fishbrew.com,
[01:41:30.100 --> 01:41:33.060]  Bold Flow. It's a product that I use.
[01:41:33.060 --> 01:41:36.900]  Also you're harvesting local indigenous organisms. That's really important.
[01:41:37.300 --> 01:41:41.740]  Whether you're doing a good biological compost or a natural farming IMO
[01:41:41.780 --> 01:41:45.020]  collection, critical. So again, you're taking,
[01:41:45.340 --> 01:41:49.060]  you're taking these ingredients kind of like a leaf.
[01:41:49.980 --> 01:41:52.340]  There's still biology and life in that leaf,
[01:41:52.340 --> 01:41:55.980]  but that leaf has to begin to break down for that biology to really come out and
[01:41:55.980 --> 01:41:59.900]  be available or be useful for your system. So it just,
[01:41:59.900 --> 01:42:03.340]  it just takes a little time. But if you inoculate out of the gate,
[01:42:03.740 --> 01:42:06.780]  you're going to have, you're going to knock the first run out of the park.
[01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:11.260]  And I've seen this over and over again with people who are committed to,
[01:42:11.260 --> 01:42:14.700]  you know, building these soil systems, but inoculating them.
[01:42:15.500 --> 01:42:18.780]  And then the first run you'll, you'll just, you'll, you'll knock it out of the
[01:42:18.780 --> 01:42:21.100]  park. So a key.
[01:42:22.060 --> 01:42:25.460]  I have a gentleman I met at the grocery store and I sent this picture to Layton
[01:42:25.780 --> 01:42:30.740]  and he bought his four by four bed and, and it's a great company.
[01:42:30.740 --> 01:42:35.140]  You guys mentioned all the time, but he bought a truckload of build a soil,
[01:42:35.180 --> 01:42:37.100]  build the soil. That's all perfect.
[01:42:37.140 --> 01:42:41.500]  And he sent me the sheet and spent $400 on dirt.
[01:42:42.580 --> 01:42:43.420]  And that's great.
[01:42:44.140 --> 01:42:48.500]  But he put it in a four by four bed and created a mud puddle.
[01:42:49.180 --> 01:42:51.020]  There's no layers. There's no drainage.
[01:42:51.020 --> 01:42:54.700]  The guy didn't even put her make it like down first for any aeration.
[01:42:55.100 --> 01:42:56.620]  So I'll ask you that Tyler,
[01:42:56.700 --> 01:42:59.980]  these guys that are just buying dirt with absolutely no horizon,
[01:43:00.340 --> 01:43:04.700]  absolutely no organic matter, like a piece of wood or something like that.
[01:43:04.700 --> 01:43:08.460]  How are they making it work? I saw that guy building that large bed.
[01:43:10.940 --> 01:43:14.540]  Well, we got to understand most people are going that route just in general.
[01:43:14.540 --> 01:43:18.620]  And that's what most people are successful with in general is those large soil
[01:43:18.620 --> 01:43:22.140]  masses that don't have any interruptions in there is what we generally see.
[01:43:23.300 --> 01:43:28.140]  It's obviously nutrient availability and micro availability and making sure that
[01:43:29.180 --> 01:43:32.740]  everything is chemically balanced within that soil mass from the top of it all
[01:43:32.740 --> 01:43:33.740]  the way down to the bottom.
[01:43:34.500 --> 01:43:38.500]  We know the microbes are in the top three or four inches of the soil is in the
[01:43:38.500 --> 01:43:39.980]  most predominant part of it,
[01:43:39.980 --> 01:43:42.380]  but obviously we need microbes throughout that whole process.
[01:43:42.380 --> 01:43:47.380]  So obviously what Layton was saying about inoculating it you know,
[01:43:47.540 --> 01:43:51.540]  anybody not doing the layering process is definitely obviously, you know,
[01:43:51.540 --> 01:43:55.420]  inoculating their beds in a massive way you know,
[01:43:55.420 --> 01:43:59.340]  by doing some sort of a root drench you know,
[01:43:59.340 --> 01:44:03.460]  down there with their compost doing mostly what we see now is obviously a
[01:44:03.460 --> 01:44:08.340]  compost extract compared to a long brew compost tea just because of things
[01:44:08.340 --> 01:44:11.900]  being able to get back into the deeper parts of the soil mass because the
[01:44:11.900 --> 01:44:15.300]  microbes aren't so sticky compared to elongated brew.
[01:44:16.460 --> 01:44:17.740]  So I mean,
[01:44:17.740 --> 01:44:21.940]  I would have to say most of my customers out there are doing just a large soil
[01:44:21.940 --> 01:44:26.300]  mass and are finding the deeper the soil they have is fresh, you know,
[01:44:26.340 --> 01:44:29.780]  beautiful soil, the best, better off that they're having.
[01:44:30.260 --> 01:44:34.060]  But can they be eliminated by using the layering system,
[01:44:34.060 --> 01:44:38.420]  which makes the soil truly alive and breathe? I mean, I get it.
[01:44:38.580 --> 01:44:39.700]  Rocks are expensive.
[01:44:39.740 --> 01:44:43.260]  Could you imagine them dropping rocks in those beds before soil?
[01:44:44.100 --> 01:44:45.700]  Triple the labor. I get that.
[01:44:46.020 --> 01:44:50.300]  But are they have drainage through that truly? I mean,
[01:44:51.740 --> 01:44:55.100]  does it turn into a mud puddle or is it ever go anaerobic?
[01:44:55.620 --> 01:44:56.260]  No, you know,
[01:44:56.260 --> 01:44:59.780]  I think it comes down to the proper management of the soil too of them knowing,
[01:44:59.780 --> 01:45:00.620]  you know,
[01:45:00.660 --> 01:45:04.380]  the right amounts of water to put in there and not doing too much as well,
[01:45:04.740 --> 01:45:05.020]  you know,
[01:45:05.020 --> 01:45:08.860]  watering these soil masses and knowing exactly how much water it takes to
[01:45:08.860 --> 01:45:12.780]  saturate this thing. You know, a lot of this comes down to exact science.
[01:45:12.780 --> 01:45:13.020]  You know,
[01:45:13.020 --> 01:45:17.900]  we need to be watering these containers anywhere from 5% to
[01:45:17.940 --> 01:45:22.260]  20% by volume. So if your container is already saturated,
[01:45:22.260 --> 01:45:24.140]  you probably only need 5%,
[01:45:24.420 --> 01:45:29.180]  5 to 10% water by volume to keep it saturated on a maintained basis.
[01:45:29.620 --> 01:45:32.980]  Now this does come down to the exact particle size of your soil,
[01:45:33.220 --> 01:45:36.860]  how fast that soil can pass through there, how much compost you have.
[01:45:36.900 --> 01:45:38.660]  Maybe you have a lot of compost in there.
[01:45:38.660 --> 01:45:42.740]  That's going to retain that water a lot longer than some other things. Um,
[01:45:43.140 --> 01:45:44.740]  you know, so that's why, you know,
[01:45:44.780 --> 01:45:48.540]  getting that soil homogenizing it into that bed as soon as possible,
[01:45:48.740 --> 01:45:53.340]  inoculating it as soon as possible and getting yourself, um, you know,
[01:45:53.900 --> 01:45:58.060]  familiar with its wet, dry patterns and how often it needs to be watered.
[01:45:58.460 --> 01:46:00.140]  I think is the biggest learning curve.
[01:46:00.140 --> 01:46:04.460]  These living soil growers have is getting that soil into that container and
[01:46:04.460 --> 01:46:05.580]  getting used to those wet,
[01:46:05.580 --> 01:46:09.780]  dry patterns because there's such a massive difference in the soil people are
[01:46:09.780 --> 01:46:12.820]  getting or mixing or making, um, or, you know,
[01:46:12.820 --> 01:46:14.500]  whatever container you're putting together.
[01:46:14.500 --> 01:46:18.340]  It's just so different from somebody right next year or so different from the,
[01:46:18.380 --> 01:46:19.940]  the tent right next to you as well.
[01:46:21.380 --> 01:46:25.180]  Well, again, you know, this goes back to watering practices.
[01:46:25.260 --> 01:46:29.540]  And that was one of the reasons why I introduced this system to cannabis
[01:46:29.540 --> 01:46:32.500]  growers, because they were either underwatering or overwatering.
[01:46:32.620 --> 01:46:34.980]  And the top of the pot would go hydrophobic.
[01:46:35.180 --> 01:46:37.180]  The bottom of the pot would go anaerobic.
[01:46:37.580 --> 01:46:41.580]  They were limited on their genetic expression. So this way, if they overwater,
[01:46:41.620 --> 01:46:45.740]  there's a place for it to go. And when, when the top starts to dry out,
[01:46:45.780 --> 01:46:48.140]  it naturally wicks the water back up.
[01:46:48.500 --> 01:46:53.220]  It prevents all of the hassles of a living soil system, uh,
[01:46:53.220 --> 01:46:57.100]  and water and keeping, keeping that delicate balance like you're talking about.
[01:46:57.780 --> 01:47:00.660]  So again, you know, the people that have,
[01:47:00.780 --> 01:47:04.060]  have tried it and hit me back up have said how,
[01:47:04.500 --> 01:47:09.100]  how it has changed their whole life because they're not babysitting their
[01:47:09.100 --> 01:47:10.860]  plants anymore. It's, it's,
[01:47:10.900 --> 01:47:15.020]  it's a really simple way to manage the watering without causing, um,
[01:47:15.100 --> 01:47:16.260]  excess stresses.
[01:47:16.620 --> 01:47:19.780]  You guys I'm up at two 30 and fucking morning here.
[01:47:21.180 --> 01:47:23.660]  Cause it's the middle of the day for my plants. Okay.
[01:47:24.060 --> 01:47:28.540]  And it's when I can work and I'm up early anyway, but, uh,
[01:47:29.100 --> 01:47:32.580]  when you're up that early, yeah, I don't want to be up there early.
[01:47:32.580 --> 01:47:34.580]  I just turned 50 the fuck.
[01:47:35.540 --> 01:47:39.460]  So if I can get something to maintain it and you know,
[01:47:39.700 --> 01:47:42.100]  I'm in a cold area, so I'll run, uh,
[01:47:42.500 --> 01:47:45.860]  I'll run at night cause it creates heat and I'll run at night because in the
[01:47:45.860 --> 01:47:50.220]  summer, you know, you're a conditioner, in fact, not cooking yet, but you know,
[01:47:50.220 --> 01:47:51.740]  you choose when you want to run.
[01:47:52.300 --> 01:47:57.020]  But if I can be down here every other day instead of every other,
[01:47:57.100 --> 01:47:58.300]  every day, it's,
[01:47:58.340 --> 01:48:01.860]  it's obviously advantageous to my time in my life and my stress.
[01:48:04.460 --> 01:48:04.620]  Yeah.
[01:48:04.620 --> 01:48:07.300]  That's why a lot of people move to a living soil system so they can actually
[01:48:07.300 --> 01:48:11.220]  give themselves a break and be able to take a weekend vacation or a week off
[01:48:11.220 --> 01:48:14.820]  and you know, water that soil a little bit more so they can not have to worry
[01:48:14.820 --> 01:48:15.820]  about it for a few days.
[01:48:16.420 --> 01:48:18.780]  Now here's something I'll put out there. Blue Mats, listen,
[01:48:20.860 --> 01:48:25.860]  control carrot up top pump injector down into the soil.
[01:48:28.900 --> 01:48:31.460]  Again, carrot control up top.
[01:48:32.180 --> 01:48:35.340]  You may need to change to an electronical system. I get it.
[01:48:36.260 --> 01:48:40.540]  But how come we can't monitor soil in the middle and inject that water into my
[01:48:40.540 --> 01:48:41.900]  rock layer instead of,
[01:48:42.340 --> 01:48:45.220]  well, you should be using a short carrot and a long carrot.
[01:48:45.260 --> 01:48:46.780]  That's what the long carrot is for.
[01:48:46.780 --> 01:48:50.780]  So we can sense the soil moisture deep in the dark in the deeper depths.
[01:48:50.780 --> 01:48:53.780]  So a lot of times you would do on one side of the bed,
[01:48:53.780 --> 01:48:56.580]  you would do a short carrot on the other side, you would do a long carrot.
[01:48:56.900 --> 01:49:00.300]  So you can get those deep waterings into the soil mass system is what a lot of
[01:49:00.300 --> 01:49:01.140]  people are doing.
[01:49:01.340 --> 01:49:04.140]  And that's, and that's why I'm building my bed.
[01:49:04.140 --> 01:49:07.540]  But I'm learning on those containers. So running one short carrot,
[01:49:08.700 --> 01:49:11.020]  I think I have one long carrot. Cause I bought the bed system.
[01:49:11.020 --> 01:49:14.820]  And I'm just mixing and matching. You are correct.
[01:49:14.900 --> 01:49:17.740]  That one 10 gallon that has that long guy in it.
[01:49:18.100 --> 01:49:20.660]  It has absolutely no stability problems.
[01:49:21.580 --> 01:49:25.180]  So they've got tools for tools for those different situations. Definitely.
[01:49:25.660 --> 01:49:30.020]  And something else that you have to understand that ceramic technology behind
[01:49:30.060 --> 01:49:32.180]  that carrot is genius.
[01:49:32.740 --> 01:49:36.780]  But the problem is in a super soil or a soilless medium,
[01:49:37.020 --> 01:49:39.980]  it's called a low tension soil for a reason.
[01:49:40.260 --> 01:49:45.260]  It does not have a lot of connection directly to that,
[01:49:45.660 --> 01:49:48.580]  that carrot. Cause there's a lot of voids in your spaces.
[01:49:49.020 --> 01:49:53.860]  So a trick that I worked with with another guy who's doing a genetic
[01:49:53.860 --> 01:49:57.420]  epigenetic crop steering using water, which is really cool.
[01:49:58.140 --> 01:50:00.100]  We wrapped his, his,
[01:50:00.180 --> 01:50:04.900]  his carrots with a combination of sand silt and clay.
[01:50:04.900 --> 01:50:09.780]  He made a muddy mess and wrapped that coated the whole carrot and
[01:50:09.780 --> 01:50:12.940]  then wrapped it in burlap. And he found once he did that,
[01:50:13.180 --> 01:50:16.940]  even in the low tension soils, it read the moisture perfectly.
[01:50:17.220 --> 01:50:21.300]  So there's a great trick to getting used to dealing with those carrots.
[01:50:21.700 --> 01:50:24.020]  Because that's going to now prevent that,
[01:50:24.540 --> 01:50:28.820]  that misunderstanding between the carrot and the controller that you're actually
[01:50:28.820 --> 01:50:29.660]  need water.
[01:50:30.020 --> 01:50:32.980]  All of my carrots are wrapped in, in clay.
[01:50:32.980 --> 01:50:36.980]  As you can see on Instagram, as you taught me there, lady, the, uh,
[01:50:37.060 --> 01:50:40.340]  the problem is that if you're in a container from what I'm learning,
[01:50:40.380 --> 01:50:43.620]  they just need to be the longer carrot. You need to measure deeper.
[01:50:44.140 --> 01:50:48.020]  And I'm going to get away from the smaller containers. Anyway,
[01:50:48.180 --> 01:50:52.140]  I'm going to be running this bed and two twenties Tyler. So now,
[01:50:52.140 --> 01:50:54.580]  when I opened the door up later and pull plants out,
[01:50:54.580 --> 01:50:57.820]  you guys will see why because I'm in a five by seven room.
[01:50:58.380 --> 01:51:02.180]  There's manhole covers for my homes, shredder pump and,
[01:51:02.260 --> 01:51:03.820]  and a sump pump there.
[01:51:04.700 --> 01:51:07.980]  This thing's going to have to roll in and out of there. It's a lot,
[01:51:08.980 --> 01:51:13.580]  but I want it and it's going to fit and it's going to work. So to me,
[01:51:14.380 --> 01:51:16.900]  it's worth it. I don't care if I got to go another year, it's worth it.
[01:51:17.580 --> 01:51:20.580]  So I did that mechanical separation here,
[01:51:20.980 --> 01:51:24.860]  bird and another three grams came.
[01:51:26.220 --> 01:51:30.180]  You can see the difference in the cookies has a, uh,
[01:51:31.460 --> 01:51:33.340]  not such a green hue to it.
[01:51:34.740 --> 01:51:37.140]  If you look at the chem on the second run,
[01:51:37.220 --> 01:51:40.060]  you're starting to get plant material here, back up on the light.
[01:51:40.780 --> 01:51:44.140]  You're starting to get plant material. If you look at the, uh,
[01:51:44.260 --> 01:51:47.140]  uh, cookie second run,
[01:51:48.540 --> 01:51:51.220]  it's almost lighter than the first run. No.
[01:51:54.020 --> 01:51:58.900]  So in that first run, it's almost like there's some dirt in it.
[01:51:59.980 --> 01:52:03.460]  And in the second run, it almost looks cleaner,
[01:52:04.900 --> 01:52:09.300]  but out of one ounce, I got six grams out of the cookies.
[01:52:09.900 --> 01:52:13.060]  And out of one ounce of chem, I got eight grams.
[01:52:15.140 --> 01:52:19.900]  And little to you guys know that my buddy Dave here
[01:52:20.620 --> 01:52:24.180]  is a hash virgin and has never smoked hash in his life.
[01:52:25.740 --> 01:52:30.740]  So I am going to do a Marin Faye small little,
[01:52:30.740 --> 01:52:31.580]  uh,
[01:52:33.020 --> 01:52:37.940]  temple ball and let him try it. And he will give you his opinion.
[01:52:39.180 --> 01:52:42.660]  But this is first experience smoking hash.
[01:52:44.300 --> 01:52:46.900]  Wait for the right track. There you go.
[01:52:47.260 --> 01:52:50.700]  Waiting for the right track home to bring home to mama.
[01:52:52.620 --> 01:52:55.380]  Now let's look down here. You guys,
[01:52:56.660 --> 01:52:58.580]  Frenchie always talked about this.
[01:52:59.420 --> 01:53:03.500]  He talked that you should be able to grab some of the hash in your fingers
[01:53:04.620 --> 01:53:09.260]  and just have it melt right in your finger, melt to your finger and turn colors.
[01:53:10.260 --> 01:53:13.740]  And that's what it does. It turns dark.
[01:53:14.500 --> 01:53:18.380]  It sticks to me and it won't release.
[01:53:19.380 --> 01:53:21.900]  So you can see it turned colors immediately.
[01:53:21.940 --> 01:53:25.220]  That means within that system, there's full melt hash.
[01:53:26.140 --> 01:53:29.300]  So I'm just going to wad up a small bowl, a ball.
[01:53:35.260 --> 01:53:39.660]  The reason why I have such an erection for this Marin Faye pipe is because out
[01:53:39.660 --> 01:53:41.300]  by me, it doesn't exist.
[01:53:42.300 --> 01:53:46.620]  You have several different glass blowers, vape shops everywhere.
[01:53:46.740 --> 01:53:51.420]  Nobody makes this thing. And I'll explain it like Bird did.
[01:53:52.940 --> 01:53:57.340]  It's a shallow bowl and it has a hole there, a hole there,
[01:53:57.340 --> 01:54:02.140]  and a hole there. Bird taught me how to use a glass rod.
[01:54:02.740 --> 01:54:06.740]  Sometimes the glass rod is better because you can sip the medication,
[01:54:07.460 --> 01:54:10.300]  but we're going to hit this guy up because he's never smoked hash.
[01:54:10.300 --> 01:54:14.540]  We want to flame on it. So I'm just going to tilt it on an angle like that.
[01:54:16.060 --> 01:54:19.780]  And just like Marin taught me, use a goddamn lighter.
[01:54:26.490 --> 01:54:28.690]  Let's get him right center stage here.
[01:54:31.290 --> 01:54:32.330]  Let him do his thing.
[01:54:32.330 --> 01:54:36.410]  So back in the day,
[01:54:36.450 --> 01:54:40.890]  I'll explain this of, we used to take this ball of hash, Layton and I,
[01:54:41.850 --> 01:54:46.610]  and we used to stick it on a pin and then take a glass and put it over it.
[01:54:46.690 --> 01:54:49.650]  Before you'd take that glass and put it over it, you'd go like this.
[01:54:51.170 --> 01:54:55.010]  It would just barely light the hash and it should catch on fire.
[01:54:56.570 --> 01:55:01.330]  Then you blow it out and it smoke fills the glass.
[01:55:01.970 --> 01:55:04.450]  Then you go under like that and you sip it. Okay.
[01:55:05.050 --> 01:55:06.930]  Smoke it like you're used to smoking a ball.
[01:55:09.270 --> 01:55:12.630]  Hi, Bird. Do you have within arm's length,
[01:55:13.350 --> 01:55:15.790]  the same kind of little bowl you showed us last time?
[01:55:34.150 --> 01:55:35.830]  Hold that back up, Brett.
[01:55:46.200 --> 01:55:48.960]  You get a glass wand that you do with it too.
[01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:53.000]  That you heat the wand up with a torch until it's red hot and then wait for it
[01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.440]  to cool down and then you roll it on the hash.
[01:55:59.870 --> 01:56:01.230]  We're ready. We're ready.
[01:56:04.350 --> 01:56:06.750]  I wanted to play homage to you there, Bird.
[01:56:12.680 --> 01:56:14.760]  But again,
[01:56:17.320 --> 01:56:19.320]  there's somebody who's handicapped or medical.
[01:56:20.160 --> 01:56:24.360]  It's kind of a danger zone to do this. So you just gotta be careful.
[01:56:24.360 --> 01:56:31.640]  Hold that flame until it gets red hot.
[01:56:41.190 --> 01:56:42.310]  Peter, did we lose Brian?
[01:56:45.870 --> 01:56:46.830]  What's that, Layton?
[01:56:48.030 --> 01:56:49.790]  It looks sweet. Oh, there he is.
[01:56:54.310 --> 01:56:55.990]  I'm going to have to peel out here soon, guys.
[01:56:57.990 --> 01:57:01.230]  Love you. Appreciate you coming on, brother. Thank you.
[01:57:01.230 --> 01:57:07.430]  Yeah, maybe I can... I know they're having some fun there,
[01:57:07.430 --> 01:57:09.950]  but I can run you guys through the warehouse real quick too and show you
[01:57:09.950 --> 01:57:21.150]  guys some cool stuff. Sure. Okay, now what you do with that glass rod
[01:57:21.150 --> 01:57:27.490]  is you just zip it and stick the glass rod in there and just
[01:57:27.490 --> 01:57:32.890]  burn it. There was an art to this, you guys. I called Maren and
[01:57:32.890 --> 01:57:33.930]  I asked her, I said,
[01:57:34.810 --> 01:57:37.770]  what's the best method? How do I not waste propane?
[01:57:38.530 --> 01:57:41.570]  And she said, you don't. It's all about the experience.
[01:57:42.690 --> 01:57:42.970]  So
[01:57:46.520 --> 01:57:50.800]  this is what, in my opinion, this is what it's about. Somebody knew that
[01:57:50.800 --> 01:57:55.280]  you're introducing to a solventless product that has never had it before.
[01:57:55.640 --> 01:58:00.120]  It's about to sit here in 10 minutes and realize why we all do
[01:58:00.120 --> 01:58:05.600]  this, why Bird is a championship. That guy right there, that guy right there
[01:58:05.600 --> 01:58:10.680]  in the TV, that guy. Yeah.
[01:58:13.440 --> 01:58:17.120]  So I'm gonna turn some lights on here a little early, but let's go
[01:58:17.120 --> 01:58:24.280]  with you. Bird, do you listen to hip hop, man?
[01:58:26.240 --> 01:58:28.240]  You ever heard of the song Trophies by Drake?
[01:58:29.960 --> 01:58:32.320]  One of the songs I like. You should listen to that, man. It reminds
[01:58:32.320 --> 01:58:36.280]  me of dudes like you. Just do it for the thing and still bring it
[01:58:36.280 --> 01:58:41.640]  home, Trophies. I'm gonna run through the warehouse real quick, guys.
[01:58:49.200 --> 01:58:50.000]  What's up, man?
[01:58:53.160 --> 01:58:57.520]  See your fabric right here, starting out. It's a cutting area. That's how we do it.
[01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:00.840]  We're getting it done.
[01:59:00.960 --> 01:59:09.940]  Four by eight beds, we got sidewalls, got our Christmas tree up.
[01:59:16.850 --> 01:59:22.210]  All of our people working over here, making beds, some four by eights.
[01:59:23.690 --> 01:59:29.650]  There, four by fours, quality check in, going through every bed to make sure
[01:59:29.650 --> 01:59:33.330]  they're absolutely perfect. It's our good man, Tim, tearing it up.
[01:59:34.330 --> 01:59:39.570]  Got some pots, 45 gallons, stocking up for the season.
[01:59:43.920 --> 01:59:47.840]  There you go, living soil. Make all of those living soil.
[01:59:50.400 --> 01:59:51.200]  Sorry, hold on.
[01:59:53.000 --> 02:00:00.330]  Can't hear you guys. Let me get out of the loudness here. Sorry about that.
[02:00:01.410 --> 02:00:03.450]  Nice operation there, brother. Looking good.
[02:00:04.130 --> 02:00:07.730]  Thank you, guys. This is what we're doing in Sacramento.
[02:00:10.650 --> 02:00:13.090]  So, yeah, let me get back out of the noisiness here.
[02:00:17.200 --> 02:00:18.440]  All this is product.
[02:00:20.560 --> 02:00:23.920]  And you guys will get a sneak peek at something nobody else has seen yet,
[02:00:23.920 --> 02:00:25.680]  so don't tell anybody about this.
[02:00:28.160 --> 02:00:29.640]  A new look of grassroots.
[02:00:33.220 --> 02:00:34.940]  Some cool stuff coming for you guys.
[02:00:36.220 --> 02:00:40.860]  Raised bags and boxes. Some really interesting stuff coming in a few months, guys.
[02:00:46.530 --> 02:00:47.410]  I can't hear you guys.
[02:00:50.920 --> 02:00:51.920]  We can hear you.
[02:00:51.920 --> 02:00:53.560]  Yeah, looking good, man. We can hear you.
[02:01:05.700 --> 02:01:08.140]  Sorry about that, guys. The audio was all jacked there.
[02:01:09.700 --> 02:01:10.740]  No, we can hear you, bud.
[02:01:13.580 --> 02:01:14.700]  Ooh, look at that.
[02:01:27.320 --> 02:01:28.960]  Is that an air king I see over there?
[02:01:31.560 --> 02:01:32.760]  Those things will run forever.
[02:01:39.770 --> 02:01:42.090]  Gotta love how he's got everything on wheels.
[02:01:43.090 --> 02:01:43.610]  Right?
[02:01:48.960 --> 02:01:52.640]  Yeah, I would say this guy, you know, for the home grower, he's really thinking it through.
[02:01:52.640 --> 02:01:55.920]  I mean, he has those little, like, lab, basically, that he's showing off today.
[02:01:56.680 --> 02:02:01.920]  Trying to learn, obviously, a variety of different things all stemming from cannabis.
[02:02:04.160 --> 02:02:07.320]  All right, guys, I'm going to take off. Thank you for having me on here. I really appreciate it.
[02:02:08.560 --> 02:02:09.560]  See you, Tyler.
[02:02:10.200 --> 02:02:11.680]  You're at the Emerald Cup?
[02:02:12.560 --> 02:02:13.720]  Yep, I'll be at the Emerald Cup.
[02:02:14.640 --> 02:02:15.560]  Yeah, we're up to meet up.
[02:02:15.680 --> 02:02:16.960]  I'll be at the Emerald Cup, too.
[02:02:17.760 --> 02:02:20.880]  Awesome. Look for me. I'm going to have some grassroot sweatshirts on me and some swag.
[02:02:21.560 --> 02:02:22.800]  Great. Well, I'll have to definitely link up.
[02:02:23.640 --> 02:02:25.360]  Awesome. We'll see you guys soon. Thank you.
[02:02:26.880 --> 02:02:28.720]  Nice. Yeah, your plant's looking good in there.
[02:02:28.720 --> 02:02:31.960]  I need to take off. Same thing. I got a bunch of stuff to do today.
[02:02:31.960 --> 02:02:34.800]  I wanted to just come in and say what's up and show some support.
[02:02:35.400 --> 02:02:38.360]  Birds, thank you so much, dude. You're the best, man.
[02:02:38.360 --> 02:02:41.600]  I mean, to answer me and help me and show me the way.
[02:02:42.640 --> 02:02:45.120]  Thank you. You're my new Frenchie, bro.
[02:02:45.680 --> 02:02:49.560]  I try. I don't know about that. I don't try.
[02:02:49.880 --> 02:02:53.160]  Hey, throw me somebody else, man. Two cups in a row. Come on.
[02:02:54.960 --> 02:02:56.160]  You got to get a look at all that, dude.
[02:02:57.800 --> 02:02:58.840]  Much appreciated, brother.
[02:02:59.440 --> 02:03:00.920]  I appreciate you guys. Have a good day.
[02:03:01.840 --> 02:03:02.840]  See ya.
[02:03:04.120 --> 02:03:08.600]  So what I'm looking for, you guys, is I'm looking, obviously, for what fits my role.
[02:03:08.960 --> 02:03:11.800]  OK. We walk in here.
[02:03:11.800 --> 02:03:13.000]  It's a five by seven.
[02:03:13.200 --> 02:03:17.320]  I run AC Infinity fans, the fans inside and outside.
[02:03:17.800 --> 02:03:22.800]  I took my Goveda and I put it on a mover, which is something a lot of people don't do.
[02:03:23.720 --> 02:03:27.040]  But I've seen about a 20 percent return benefit.
[02:03:27.360 --> 02:03:33.320]  OK. I run my Goveda sensor within my canopy.
[02:03:33.880 --> 02:03:35.480]  I don't have it up here in the sun.
[02:03:36.680 --> 02:03:39.880]  I want to know what the temperature of the plant is, not what my dream is.
[02:03:39.920 --> 02:03:42.920]  I always want my plant to be at 70 percent or 70 degrees.
[02:03:42.920 --> 02:03:43.920]  76 is my room temperature usually.
[02:03:43.920 --> 02:03:50.920]  This plant here, you can see that it's not so much a deficiency as much as it is maybe a overwatering problem.
[02:03:50.920 --> 02:03:53.920]  If this was a nutrient problem, my tips would be different.
[02:03:53.920 --> 02:03:56.920]  But this is an Elevate Genetics Candy candy.
[02:03:56.920 --> 02:03:59.920]  And certainly it smells like oranges.
[02:03:59.920 --> 02:04:02.920]  And that's the cool thing about this is it's got a lot of nutrients.
[02:04:02.920 --> 02:04:03.920]  It's got a lot of fiber.
[02:04:03.920 --> 02:04:04.920]  It's got a lot of fiber.
[02:04:04.920 --> 02:04:05.920]  It's got a lot of fiber.
[02:04:05.920 --> 02:04:06.920]  It's got a lot of fiber.
[02:04:06.960 --> 02:04:07.960]  It smells like oranges.
[02:04:07.960 --> 02:04:16.960]  That's the cool thing about this is to receive genetics and actually have them taste like the fucking package says, is awesome.
[02:04:16.960 --> 02:04:19.960]  So this is a 10 inch candy.
[02:04:19.960 --> 02:04:22.960]  This is Kali Connections Chem FromC.
[02:04:22.960 --> 02:04:26.960]  When I hit it with that JMS, all these leaves turned purple.
[02:04:26.960 --> 02:04:33.960]  That's telling me my plant container has too much nitrogen in it, and either this plant wants it,
[02:04:33.960 --> 02:04:44.920]  or it's in abundance so it's trying to burn it off. So Elevate Tangy Candy, Chem 4 OG
[02:04:44.920 --> 02:04:52.080]  from Kelly Connections is the other one. As I try and fit stuff into my room and
[02:04:52.080 --> 02:04:58.520]  in this bed it's a choice of do I need monsters like that? That Chem is gonna
[02:04:58.520 --> 02:05:03.760]  bring me 12 ounces and the Tangy Candy is probably gonna bring me nine. But here's
[02:05:03.760 --> 02:05:13.840]  my 33. This is Gelatomo by Elevate and it produces 32.7% THC.
[02:05:13.840 --> 02:05:20.520]  This was applied, JMS was applied to this as well as everybody else. There is not
[02:05:20.520 --> 02:05:26.000]  one deficiency in this plant. It is from seed. It's not showing me anything wrong.
[02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:32.160]  I will not gut its fan leaves. It's an indica. Look at that fan leaf. Size of my
[02:05:32.160 --> 02:05:37.520]  hand. Why would I pull that leaf off when it's healthy and doing good? So that's my
[02:05:37.520 --> 02:05:46.640]  opinion on that. This is Buddha Kush Tahoe OG from Kelly Connections and
[02:05:46.640 --> 02:05:51.960]  this is a clone. So again this plant seems to be doing really well with the
[02:05:51.960 --> 02:05:56.760]  JMS. It doesn't have too many nutrients in it. It's in a five gallon pot and
[02:05:56.800 --> 02:06:04.720]  doing well. So continue nutrients in about another three days. I consider the
[02:06:04.720 --> 02:06:08.560]  Buddha, I've been growing it for three years, that's a clone. I have more seeds.
[02:06:08.560 --> 02:06:13.600]  That's a staple because it tastes like blueberries, turns purple and gives me
[02:06:13.600 --> 02:06:21.480]  the terpene count that I want for inflammation. And this is a Chem 4 OG
[02:06:21.480 --> 02:06:28.360]  clone which is really heavy. For some reason these clones stay heavy and short
[02:06:28.360 --> 02:06:35.560]  compared to the mothers. This will bring me nine ounces compared to what they say
[02:06:35.560 --> 02:06:40.880]  13 on the other one. So it's showing deficiency and it's not deficiency.
[02:06:40.880 --> 02:06:44.720]  It's just got too much water in it. So the leaves are curling, starting to
[02:06:44.720 --> 02:06:50.320]  bleach out, burn up top. When something burns up top and doesn't burn down low
[02:06:50.320 --> 02:06:53.960]  that tells me it's got too much water in it and I can tell obviously by food.
[02:06:53.960 --> 02:07:02.600]  But the Chem's been a staple. Obviously it always will be and the Gelatomo from
[02:07:02.600 --> 02:07:07.920]  Elevate is a new staple too because it's, I mean you touch it, it smells like
[02:07:07.920 --> 02:07:13.840]  grapes. It's my granddaddy perp replacement and that again has whatever
[02:07:13.840 --> 02:07:19.640]  is in purple and whatever makes things taste like grapes makes my PTSD just go
[02:07:19.640 --> 02:07:26.920]  away. Makes me not think about those times off-grid. So these are the plants
[02:07:26.920 --> 02:07:32.440]  you guys and these are all unfortunately a salt run that I'm now trying to change
[02:07:32.440 --> 02:07:38.800]  over to Korean natural farming with some success. And I'm going to do a compost
[02:07:38.800 --> 02:07:43.680]  tea and treat them instead of hitting them with a bottle. So watch my Instagram
[02:07:43.720 --> 02:07:50.960]  and you'll see how that either makes it or doesn't make it. So that's those guys
[02:07:50.960 --> 02:07:57.640]  and I'll show you this other project I got going on which is M2 from Elevate.
[02:07:57.640 --> 02:08:04.520]  I got a regular pack of seeds so I can do some more breeding. I had a male, you
[02:08:04.520 --> 02:08:09.320]  call that male out here, that hemp male, Layton, we call it Lebowski because it
[02:08:09.440 --> 02:08:16.000]  grows huge. And the guy that grows it in his yard literally looks like Jeff Bridges.
[02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:20.840]  So I'm back into some some breeding myself for some stuff I'll probably pop
[02:08:20.840 --> 02:08:28.240]  in the summer. And that's an M2 Elevate male. It's opened up a flower or two. It's
[02:08:28.240 --> 02:08:32.960]  just about ready to release. That's why I switched it over to my veg tent so that
[02:08:32.960 --> 02:08:42.240]  it wouldn't destroy anybody inside. And this whole veg tent here full of
[02:08:42.240 --> 02:08:50.920]  Terminators, I'll just go down the line. For that gelatomo short squatty action
[02:08:50.920 --> 02:09:03.180]  I'm hoping that I can find some more here. This is apple candy. Shorter, bushier
[02:09:03.180 --> 02:09:12.240]  and might be up my alley. This is growing longer, longer nodes, tangy candy, just
[02:09:12.240 --> 02:09:17.480]  like the one inside. Same pack of seeds. We're going to see if there's consistency.
[02:09:17.480 --> 02:09:20.920]  And that's why I'm going to grow it for Elevate, to show them if there's consistency.
[02:09:20.920 --> 02:09:25.920]  That's what these guys are looking for is consistency, not big huge beautiful
[02:09:25.920 --> 02:09:30.120]  pictures on Instagram. They want to know if their seeds are going to make it. This
[02:09:30.200 --> 02:09:37.480]  is apple alamode. And the difference that I see in the Terminator with the living
[02:09:37.480 --> 02:09:42.520]  soil compared to this blank one is obviously growth. If you look at these
[02:09:42.520 --> 02:09:47.440]  plants, I don't know if it's a difference in the genetics of the Terminator, but
[02:09:47.440 --> 02:09:56.560]  thinner leaves, showing a little wilting. The cupping on these leaves, how it hangs,
[02:09:56.800 --> 02:10:01.440]  how it handles moisture. I think that's the difference between the bag of having
[02:10:01.440 --> 02:10:05.960]  that moisture around the loophole compared to constantly just trimming it. I see the
[02:10:05.960 --> 02:10:15.160]  consistency effect. This is, crossing on me, frosty melons. I can't wait to see her go.
[02:10:15.160 --> 02:10:20.920]  Her stem is so thick compared to everybody else. It's just certain things that you notice that
[02:10:20.920 --> 02:10:25.480]  you might want in your structure without trellising, without using twine. The plant
[02:10:25.520 --> 02:10:32.160]  should support itself, you guys. For your growth, make it as easy as possible. This
[02:10:32.160 --> 02:10:37.880]  is baker's fruit. Look at the size of that thing. This is plant, all these plants are
[02:10:37.880 --> 02:10:44.480]  two months old, one gallon, no deficiencies. I think I've fed them nutrients twice and
[02:10:44.480 --> 02:10:51.160]  haven't given them food in a while. Latent. What is this? What happens when my leaves
[02:10:51.160 --> 02:10:53.800]  dissipate? Is that over watering at some point?
[02:10:53.800 --> 02:10:58.280]  Yeah, it's some kind of free genetic expression.
[02:10:58.280 --> 02:11:06.120]  Okay. Just as long as it's not a bug or something I'm doing wrong. You know what I mean? I always
[02:11:06.120 --> 02:11:10.840]  like other opinions and I think this is the only time I'm really going to get them.
[02:11:10.840 --> 02:11:18.120]  What's the rationale for not letting them grow straight up, from the legislation standpoint?
[02:11:18.120 --> 02:11:25.000]  I'll fill this a little more as it spills out when I tilt them. This plant is not five
[02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:30.680]  inches above the soil surface. Once it's five inches above the soil surface, it's a considerate
[02:11:30.680 --> 02:11:33.640]  plant and I'm over it now.
[02:11:33.640 --> 02:11:37.760]  Just to clarify, I don't think the state is encouraging people to grow them sideways.
[02:11:37.760 --> 02:11:43.400]  I think that's stoner ingenuity trying to get around state five inch rules and saying,
[02:11:43.400 --> 02:11:45.960]  fine, I'll just grow it sideways.
[02:11:46.360 --> 02:11:50.600]  I also have two cards in my home so I can have 10 plants.
[02:11:53.560 --> 02:12:00.840]  That's my justification behind that. And you know what? Bring it. I'll go to court. If you
[02:12:00.840 --> 02:12:07.000]  can have four plants in this state with no card and have someone walk in and write you a $600
[02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.560]  ticket. I'm trying to-
[02:12:09.560 --> 02:12:12.040]  I wouldn't do all that, man. I would just-
[02:12:12.040 --> 02:12:16.120]  I'm doing what the fuck I want to do, but I'm trying to do it underneath their umbrella. I get
[02:12:16.120 --> 02:12:20.680]  that, but I'm showing the whole fucking world right now so I can get a shit.
[02:12:21.320 --> 02:12:25.400]  Always respect to the ops, right? We're not going to- we would never want that on you, man.
[02:12:26.280 --> 02:12:31.880]  So I will show you something that Blue Matt- Blue Matt will design you a system
[02:12:31.880 --> 02:12:39.160]  for what they know you need. I ignored that. So here's my reservoir. Got some quick
[02:12:39.160 --> 02:12:43.720]  connects that pass through. And instead of running a loop like they want,
[02:12:44.520 --> 02:12:50.200]  I can't do a loop in here. I need to walk in my room. I ran the lines along here and some conduit
[02:12:50.200 --> 02:12:58.120]  left over from the bill. Each line has a drop down. In between each line, I have a pressure
[02:12:58.120 --> 02:13:04.360]  regulator line. So my whole system of Blue Matt runs around the outer perimeter of my walls.
[02:13:05.240 --> 02:13:12.200]  Because that two by four bed is going to barely roll in here, roll over that steel plate,
[02:13:12.200 --> 02:13:18.760]  and be positioned right there. So I'll have a two by four bed with 220 gallons of big soil pots in
[02:13:18.760 --> 02:13:25.800]  the end. That's my goal for this room. Will these plants fit in there? God, no. Three of these
[02:13:25.800 --> 02:13:31.080]  plants, three of these stem plants are not going to fit in that two by four bed just by volume.
[02:13:31.080 --> 02:13:36.360]  So I need to choose a breed and what's going to go for me. And I'm not going to tell anybody what
[02:13:36.360 --> 02:13:43.080]  that is till I decide. Follow me on Instagram, I guess. I only started my Instagram to hook up
[02:13:43.080 --> 02:13:48.600]  with Tom and show him what I'm doing and help people. I have no financial goal here, you guys,
[02:13:48.600 --> 02:13:56.360]  outside of once I'm done with this recirculating hashing system, maybe put that out there and let
[02:13:56.360 --> 02:14:04.680]  you guys play with it. But for me, I want you guys, future cannabis project, to learn from
[02:14:04.680 --> 02:14:09.640]  everything that I've done and everything that you've taught me. I mean, again, here's where I
[02:14:09.640 --> 02:14:15.880]  started. But I should be taking my plant material and feeding them back to my plants to have it be
[02:14:15.880 --> 02:14:25.480]  truly successful. You know, although I've been standing up a lot. So I know you're watching,
[02:14:25.480 --> 02:14:34.040]  brother. I can reach everything. I can reach everything from a chair, everything. So handicapped
[02:14:34.040 --> 02:14:39.560]  people should just take cue of this episode and maybe learn a couple things from me as far as
[02:14:39.560 --> 02:14:45.560]  making it easier on yourself to not. Don't think you can't do this. You can do this. Even if it's
[02:14:45.560 --> 02:14:51.080]  one or two people helping you at one point, a living soil system is going to be less maintenance
[02:14:51.080 --> 02:14:55.960]  on you in the end. And I've learned that and it's not even built yet. I'm learning that from
[02:14:55.960 --> 02:15:04.600]  these containers. So future cannabis project, thank you. And a couple mentions I need to do.
[02:15:04.600 --> 02:15:09.480]  I mean, I know we did that at the end, but they can turn me on to dragon flyer of medicine.
[02:15:11.240 --> 02:15:19.320]  Those people rock. I mean, those people rock. Everything that I've tried to do with my injuries
[02:15:19.320 --> 02:15:26.680]  and my surgeries in the way it is the way they speak the way. And I just by saying the way
[02:15:27.480 --> 02:15:33.720]  you should fucking know what I'm talking about. It's not a definition of being a vegan or a
[02:15:33.720 --> 02:15:39.320]  definition of being this person. There really should be only one way. And it shouldn't be this
[02:15:39.320 --> 02:15:45.640]  asshole that just bought a house out my front door, cutting down every oak tree to put up a building.
[02:15:46.600 --> 02:15:54.120]  It shouldn't be a dispensary in Illinois that thrives off of people being addicted to solvents.
[02:15:54.120 --> 02:15:57.960]  People, you keep going back there because you're addicted to solvent.
[02:15:59.320 --> 02:16:06.440]  I've had your black market blood tested. There's a reason why it's black market. It was rejected
[02:16:06.440 --> 02:16:12.520]  from a dispensary in Colorado. Something's wrong with it. Start growing for yourself.
[02:16:12.840 --> 02:16:17.960]  You have to, if you're someone like me who has medical issues, whether it's physical,
[02:16:17.960 --> 02:16:22.840]  mental and or other don't solve your problems at the bottom of the bottle or the bottom of
[02:16:22.840 --> 02:16:28.360]  the pill bottle. These are all remedies. When I took myself off of opiates through two surgeries
[02:16:28.360 --> 02:16:35.240]  in the last year, again, this company, if you're not making your own, you search them out. Michigan
[02:16:36.040 --> 02:16:42.120]  420, they make extreme sabs, extreme and oasis is their brand. And without them,
[02:16:43.240 --> 02:16:49.400]  that's the solution to getting off of opiates. If you can't buy that, take a quarter ounce,
[02:16:49.400 --> 02:16:54.600]  half ounce of marijuana, put it in your grow room, put it in the sun, put it in somewhere
[02:16:54.600 --> 02:17:00.040]  where it turns it in to the shittiest smelling, shittiest tasting brown weed you've ever smelled
[02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:07.560]  or tasted. And you're going to make yourself some really good CBN medicine just with Everclear.
[02:17:08.200 --> 02:17:14.920]  You don't need to smoke it, bake it off, ingest it, do an eye dropper. You can also do the same
[02:17:14.920 --> 02:17:23.560]  thing with the MCT oil. Levo is outside of mechanically doing it with a stirrer. You need
[02:17:23.560 --> 02:17:27.880]  to look at what they do. Anybody creating medicine, whether it's opiates, whether it's
[02:17:27.960 --> 02:17:36.440]  anybody creating medicine, whether it's oil or, or tinctures, butters, you can use rosemary,
[02:17:36.440 --> 02:17:43.640]  you can make garlic. And there's so many other chef options for that. It's the way. And I think
[02:17:43.640 --> 02:17:51.720]  it's time for us to whip out the, these two little machines I want to show you guys that hopefully
[02:17:52.360 --> 02:17:59.000]  give you an idea, maybe something you can do or give these other guys a bigger idea of how to buy
[02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:06.600]  a cheap little machine that could possibly change your idea towards solvents. I know you're a
[02:18:06.600 --> 02:18:11.880]  dispensary. I know you're a producer. I know you're a small crafter, but this thing is only $200.
[02:18:13.160 --> 02:18:18.120]  The other dirt sifters that come with it are from Amazon for like 25 and 30 bucks.
[02:18:18.760 --> 02:18:22.600]  So you can't tell me with all the profits that you're making millions,
[02:18:23.320 --> 02:18:29.480]  rise dispensary in Mundelein, you just opened up another million dollar segment and you can't
[02:18:29.480 --> 02:18:37.800]  afford a $200 solventless flour extractor to maybe make me something. That's pretty pathetic.
[02:18:37.800 --> 02:18:42.120]  Grab that thing. So I'm going to show you guys this thing. And it's just out of me looking at
[02:18:42.200 --> 02:18:49.560]  all these shakers and sifters and dry sifters. And in high school, I ran graphics department.
[02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:57.800]  We all know what this is, no? Silk screen, 200 micron. It'll make you something,
[02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:10.790]  but that's old school. You need electricity. So if you go to Amazon, you find this guy.
[02:19:11.350 --> 02:19:22.070]  It's a flower shifter. I got the springs from a hardware store and my seamstress made this little
[02:19:23.190 --> 02:19:29.510]  canvas thing for me, which you really don't even need if you're just extracting one or two items.
[02:19:32.070 --> 02:19:38.870]  This set is 25 bucks from either eBay or Amazon. Comes with four different screens you can change
[02:19:39.830 --> 02:19:44.390]  out. I call this a work tray. So if I have outdoor wheat with seeds in it,
[02:19:44.390 --> 02:19:48.630]  because that hemp brings me ridiculous seeds, it'll kind of track it there.
[02:19:52.310 --> 02:19:57.190]  Smash down. I call this a pre-roll bin because if I was going to make some pre-rolls,
[02:19:57.190 --> 02:20:01.990]  that size is going to screen it. Again, dispensaries and processors. I don't want
[02:20:01.990 --> 02:20:07.670]  to hear that you can't spend two or 300 bucks to make a solventless product when I'm showing you
[02:20:07.670 --> 02:20:16.150]  how. Edibles. This screen is a 80 mesh, which I believe works out to be a 177 micron.
[02:20:17.350 --> 02:20:19.030]  And then here's your 100 micron.
[02:20:21.750 --> 02:20:26.630]  Underneath that, I took the liberty, which you can already see some trichomes sticking to,
[02:20:26.630 --> 02:20:36.330]  of making a black plastic static plate. So if you just go like this and create some static,
[02:20:37.290 --> 02:20:43.530]  put it in reverse. It blocks the hole where the normal flour is supposed to come out if you're a
[02:20:43.530 --> 02:20:49.690]  chef. So when this thing shakes, the flour is supposed to come out that hole. Cover it up.
[02:20:49.690 --> 02:20:55.690]  You're not going to lose any material. What do we want here? We want hash. Okay, so here's 100
[02:20:55.690 --> 02:21:05.530]  micron. 100 micron down to static. 177. So with these two stacked containers,
[02:21:06.650 --> 02:21:15.290]  just figure out a spring system that holds them on. So that's what I did. I had ideas of creating a
[02:21:15.290 --> 02:21:22.650]  continuous static producer. And I don't have the knowledge to do that because I'm not an
[02:21:22.650 --> 02:21:28.250]  electronical engineer. But if you take those nuts on the bottom of that, which create the vibration
[02:21:28.810 --> 02:21:35.450]  and magnetize them, fasten a piece of felt to the end of it or something, you should be able
[02:21:35.450 --> 02:21:42.650]  to create some kind of static that makes that plastic plate grab more. Again, I'm hoping that
[02:21:42.650 --> 02:21:48.410]  somebody in an industry other than myself is going to be able to make whatever the hell this is
[02:21:48.410 --> 02:21:54.970]  better. And I'm about to take some material and show you guys that on a small scale that it
[02:21:54.970 --> 02:22:01.450]  actually works. So you don't need to question it. You just need to pretty much go do it.
[02:22:05.730 --> 02:22:11.490]  So I'm going to use what I call my dead material to do this. And we're going to literally shed that
[02:22:11.490 --> 02:22:18.130]  other hemp plant right in front of you guys, right into the collection tray. That way it's real time.
[02:22:18.930 --> 02:22:25.010]  Again, the excuses are getting so old on why a dispensary can't have a
[02:22:25.650 --> 02:22:32.490]  product when here we are just doing it. So here's the setup.
[02:22:34.490 --> 02:22:41.690]  A simple little canvas cover over their stuff. Hardware bought clip, existing spring that comes
[02:22:41.690 --> 02:22:48.410]  with the shaker. There's no excuses you guys. So I'm going to undo this again.
[02:22:50.490 --> 02:22:51.770]  We're going to strip this plant.
[02:22:54.730 --> 02:22:55.930]  And we're going to see what happens.
[02:22:58.090 --> 02:23:01.930]  When I was talking to Bird and Layton about bud structure,
[02:23:02.170 --> 02:23:05.690]  they said, look at this. This is a good bud structure.
[02:23:07.690 --> 02:23:17.450]  This material is so dry and so loose. It should just shed right off.
[02:23:18.490 --> 02:23:26.970]  Full plant, no special bucking tool, no special fucking $300 trim bag to fucking process the
[02:23:27.450 --> 02:23:34.730]  some nylon bag or some plastic bag. Now, am I doing this quick and messy? Yeah, I'm doing it
[02:23:34.730 --> 02:23:39.770]  quick and messy because I'm showing you guys. Would I be controlling this better? Yeah, where
[02:23:39.770 --> 02:23:44.890]  I do this, there's a stream from a sliding glass door that catches anything with paper underneath
[02:23:44.890 --> 02:23:50.490]  it. So just trying to get an example. And I've never even tested this machine yet.
[02:23:51.130 --> 02:23:56.650]  This is just us doing this. So hopefully there's some results. And I think there's going to be.
[02:23:57.930 --> 02:24:07.460]  Because it's coming off in my hands. What do you think? Is that enough? A couple ounces in there.
[02:24:19.070 --> 02:24:25.390]  Okay, here's the hard part, guys. No big shredder. This is what I used to do when I was a child.
[02:24:26.510 --> 02:24:32.670]  When marijuana is wet and you do this, all of the trichomes stick to your hands. You guys have
[02:24:32.910 --> 02:24:41.790]  gotten this mess on you before. So in Afghanistan, when I learned, by now if I touched this much
[02:24:41.790 --> 02:24:46.510]  marijuana, I'd have it all over my hands and it'd be sticky. But this stuff is so dry,
[02:24:47.710 --> 02:24:54.270]  it's coming right off, which is perfect for dry sift extraction. It's not sticking to me,
[02:24:54.270 --> 02:25:00.270]  which means it's not going to stick to this machine. It's approximately 67 degrees in here,
[02:25:00.270 --> 02:25:06.110]  which you guys are all running at 50 degrees to wash. And I get that. I'd rather be running
[02:25:06.110 --> 02:25:12.350]  in a frozen environment too. But again, we're after no excuses from a dispensary. Oh, it was
[02:25:12.350 --> 02:25:18.590]  too hot. Oh, it was too cold. I don't have a special room. Shut up and watch this video and
[02:25:18.590 --> 02:25:27.990]  you're going to learn. And I don't want to say it like that so arrogantly, but you guys, I'm hoping
[02:25:27.990 --> 02:25:37.270]  that these returns prove my little theory. Maybe it won't, but something tells me we're about to
[02:25:37.270 --> 02:25:57.620]  have three levels of some ash here. Isn't it nice to have an assistant? Okay. Now, I did start this
[02:25:57.620 --> 02:26:09.790]  up in my freezer and I did try it and it makes a lot of fucking noise. So I got a fan rheostat.
[02:26:17.640 --> 02:26:20.520]  I have a fan rheostat that's going to control the speed.
[02:26:36.490 --> 02:26:47.320]  Okay, so we got that. Okay.
[02:26:48.120 --> 02:26:58.350]  And because it's so loud, I'm going to put it out in the garage and let it run so I can talk to you
[02:26:58.350 --> 02:27:07.550]  guys. Plug it in, let it run. Now, what did that take me guys? 15 minutes, maybe. Got the machine
[02:27:07.550 --> 02:27:12.750]  down, took a plant, chopped it up. It's going to put it out in the garage and run it and we're
[02:27:12.750 --> 02:27:20.430]  going to see what happens. The next thing I want to, when I was asking Bird about all those
[02:27:20.910 --> 02:27:27.390]  questions about refining the material that I have, this is the little machine I made out of
[02:27:27.390 --> 02:27:38.990]  plastic plates, simple hardware, vibrating machine from eBay. These sieves are 20 bucks for three of
[02:27:39.390 --> 02:27:58.000]  them. They come in every single micron. And Bird just told us to run a 160, right? 160 through a
[02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:08.560]  45. So once I have these plastic plates made, I will sell them. All you need to do is buy that
[02:28:08.560 --> 02:28:14.480]  vibrating table I'm going to show you. And you don't need a custom vibrator. You don't need all
[02:28:14.480 --> 02:28:21.360]  of these things. I'll eventually make it, but you don't need to have it. What I am doing,
[02:28:21.360 --> 02:28:28.960]  which I wasn't going to show anybody, I think it's around here somewhere. You guys,
[02:28:29.040 --> 02:28:33.520]  you know how solvent recirculates?
[02:28:35.920 --> 02:28:43.440]  And making a vacuum base that'll take a Buffner filter, it'll sit on the table and a vacuum
[02:28:43.440 --> 02:28:50.800]  will recirculate the system and vibrate it and make a recirculating, vibrating air system.
[02:28:51.920 --> 02:28:58.240]  You don't need a solvent machine for this, you guys. They should have invented this. They didn't.
[02:28:58.960 --> 02:29:03.920]  They don't want you healthy. I don't know why, but here I am. I'm going to prove the theory.
[02:29:04.480 --> 02:29:11.360]  And I'm going to sell a base plate that stays on the table and all the necessary parts for you to
[02:29:11.360 --> 02:29:19.760]  buy eBay stuff. I'll be able to do this for hopefully total about 500 bucks. So Bird said to run
[02:29:20.880 --> 02:29:28.640]  160 through 45. So I'm going to spin these off real quick and see indeed if I can take the hash
[02:29:28.640 --> 02:29:37.360]  that I just made and refine it further. It's at a 150, so I would expect that all of it should fall
[02:29:37.360 --> 02:29:47.800]  through the 160 in theory. Any thoughts so far, you guys? I feel like I'm alone.
[02:29:48.600 --> 02:29:55.400]  No, man, we're kind of watching you walk and talk through it. What kind of gave you the idea to do
[02:29:55.400 --> 02:30:01.880]  this? Is there any kind of like, are you mimicking something or is this one of a kind?
[02:30:01.880 --> 02:30:08.040]  I did one of a kind. I'm just making it right now. And this is my idea. I mailed in a small
[02:30:08.040 --> 02:30:14.280]  drawing as a patent to myself yesterday in case somebody does try to screw me like Coca-Cola.
[02:30:15.320 --> 02:30:21.480]  I get it. But go to CannaCon. Look at all them dumb ass fucking solvent recirculators that hold
[02:30:21.480 --> 02:30:26.360]  the material right here and just go like this and extract everything out of it. Well, why can't we
[02:30:26.360 --> 02:30:32.360]  do that with air and see if you guys get a Dyson vacuum? I should be able to hook this thing up
[02:30:32.360 --> 02:30:37.720]  so that you have a... where the fuck did this thing go? So you have a vacuum base plate. It's going to have
[02:30:37.720 --> 02:30:44.360]  sides. It's going to be bigger. Hook it up to a normal home vacuum with a 25 micron Buckner filter
[02:30:44.360 --> 02:30:51.240]  hooked up just like those solvent idiots use doing alcohol extraction and not kill yourself,
[02:30:51.240 --> 02:30:57.800]  making some material. There's no reason why people shouldn't be able to do this. And if it goes
[02:30:57.800 --> 02:31:03.960]  successful, I'll make a vacuum system that goes inside that flower sifter so you can hook a shock
[02:31:03.960 --> 02:31:11.000]  back right up to the end of it, have a vacuum base in it so when it vibrates down, it's a constant
[02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:21.400]  airflow that recirculates. This little tube here is an air whip, okay? It has a little resonator
[02:31:21.400 --> 02:31:24.840]  inside of it that creates a cyclone and I'm going to show that to you guys.
[02:31:29.300 --> 02:31:34.660]  So basically with the technology today, if you... morally, if you don't mind buying from
[02:31:34.660 --> 02:31:38.500]  companies like Amazon and stuff, you could get all these little components delivered straight to your
[02:31:38.500 --> 02:31:46.020]  house. Everything was delivered to my house from eBay or Amazon. These sieves, this vibrating motor,
[02:31:46.020 --> 02:31:51.220]  these little stupid LED lights I'm putting in there for power and stuff, and the blowback,
[02:31:51.220 --> 02:31:55.780]  you guys, the vacuum delivery system will be a resonator that has little air holes in it
[02:31:55.780 --> 02:32:02.340]  that stirs the hash in the top chamber so you never get low. And again, right now it's all theory
[02:32:02.340 --> 02:32:08.420]  until I do it, but my math is pretty sound. So we're going to take the 120 again. I've already
[02:32:08.420 --> 02:32:15.460]  done some of this. There's some 160 just as a test and this was junk though, some dead stuff,
[02:32:15.460 --> 02:32:21.380]  and I'm still harvesting stuff out of dead material. So Bird said what here? So 160
[02:32:22.660 --> 02:32:28.260]  and a 120 and a 45. So we got to ditch some material.
[02:32:28.980 --> 02:32:39.450]  So 160 is my work bin. 120 is a catch. Some hash in there that has to go.
[02:32:43.210 --> 02:32:50.020]  Okay. Assemblage via Bird.
[02:32:52.820 --> 02:33:02.180]  Now for the part that as a guy like me at my level again, for my current level,
[02:33:02.500 --> 02:33:09.220]  for my current level, to take this amount of hash and just put it through these machines and try and
[02:33:09.220 --> 02:33:14.500]  prove theory and prove that it works is so difficult for me, but here we go.
[02:33:15.380 --> 02:33:20.020]  Hey, didn't he say 45 micron, not 25? Do you have a 45?
[02:33:20.900 --> 02:33:27.380]  I do have the 45, but I have to have three in a stack or it won't stack right. So like these
[02:33:27.380 --> 02:33:32.740]  bolts and to have the machine work, it's got to have three of them. So it's just a matter of
[02:33:33.300 --> 02:33:39.940]  having the right tolerance in there. So I guess if it's a micron, you guys,
[02:33:40.580 --> 02:33:45.380]  we're about to make a hybrid hash. See, I'm just going to take all of this hash and do it.
[02:33:46.260 --> 02:33:50.980]  Fuck it, you know? So I'd say there's probably
[02:33:53.060 --> 02:34:03.380]  six, six, about 15 grams in here. And that's a lot for me. That's like a lot, you guys. I would
[02:34:03.380 --> 02:34:16.140]  smoke that hash over weeks. Amazing how it's not supposed to stick to parchment paper, but it does.
[02:34:16.940 --> 02:34:24.310]  I'm hoping this is groundbreaking. I'm hoping somebody calls me and wants to
[02:34:24.310 --> 02:34:29.190]  work with me or actually do something with this technology to help people.
[02:34:31.990 --> 02:34:37.670]  I mean, Byrd's got it down, but you guys, I can't afford a $3,000 freeze dryer. I just can't.
[02:34:38.230 --> 02:34:44.230]  So, I remember when we were talking before, like the pre-interview, you were saying that,
[02:34:44.390 --> 02:34:50.470]  you know, Toad kind of gives you inspiration. And there were some things that you were working on
[02:34:50.470 --> 02:34:55.910]  that you wanted to kind of show so that individuals that might not be able to get around as easily,
[02:34:55.910 --> 02:34:59.430]  that's why I brought up, you know, being able to have it shipped to your house, make something like
[02:34:59.430 --> 02:35:04.070]  this. So again, man, I feel like hopefully it does work because this is kind of cool. And the fact
[02:35:04.070 --> 02:35:10.390]  that you're really thinking this through, man, pretty unique. Brian, fuck me, man. Take wood
[02:35:10.390 --> 02:35:15.830]  and do this. It doesn't need to be clear acrylic plastic. You guys do this for yourselves. I'm
[02:35:15.830 --> 02:35:20.310]  going to eventually make these. I have a CNC shop. I can make this. Not worried about that.
[02:35:20.870 --> 02:35:26.630]  I'm worried about you guys. I'm worried about people like me out there that can't do this.
[02:35:26.630 --> 02:35:32.950]  So that's why sleepless nights, doing the math, figuring out what would fit. You know, I have my
[02:35:32.950 --> 02:35:38.150]  cute little vibrator here, but I have a vibrating table here somewhere. I got to find it. And that
[02:35:38.150 --> 02:35:43.350]  was my original idea. So you can buy this vibrating table. If I make a vibrating top,
[02:35:43.350 --> 02:35:49.430]  I have to become UL approved. I am going to be, have liability insurance and all that stuff. I've
[02:35:49.430 --> 02:35:54.790]  made pedicure stations from scratch for hair designers. I know what it takes to get all this
[02:35:54.790 --> 02:35:59.670]  shit approved. I don't want that. I want you to be able to buy this little stuff and make it happen
[02:35:59.670 --> 02:36:04.870]  yourself. If I need to sell a vacuum plate that hooks up to a Dyson or what do I have over there?
[02:36:04.870 --> 02:36:10.390]  Some kind of fucking shark. It's an inch and a half fitting a shop back will work. So
[02:36:11.830 --> 02:36:14.230]  we stable out there. Is it, is it vibrated away?
[02:36:16.870 --> 02:36:22.630]  So it's staying in place. Yeah. Yeah. It has a resonator mat that comes with it. You guys. So it,
[02:36:22.630 --> 02:36:28.790]  it kind of jumps around if it's not on concrete. So it has this rubber carpet kind of mat thing.
[02:36:29.270 --> 02:36:37.190]  So it sits on, so it won't jump around for safety, but like my little pollinator or pollen extractor,
[02:36:37.190 --> 02:36:42.550]  I literally emptied my freezer and put it in there and it sounded like elephants coming through my
[02:36:42.550 --> 02:36:48.950]  freezer. So I figured that wasn't the way, but right now outside it's about 52 degrees. I'd say
[02:36:49.510 --> 02:37:04.600]  maybe so. It'll work two more wing nuts on this thing. And then I got to hook a power source up
[02:37:04.600 --> 02:37:08.200]  to it if I want to do it that way, but I'll show you that table. Where is that table?
[02:37:10.040 --> 02:37:13.480]  Little, it should be a little electric table around somewhere.
[02:37:15.320 --> 02:37:20.120]  I usually do this on Sunday, you guys. So I'll take my day off, come down, make some chocolate,
[02:37:20.120 --> 02:37:26.360]  bucket stuff, clean out the room, give it a weekly clean. So to have this much out right now,
[02:37:27.080 --> 02:37:32.520]  it's a lot for me to remember. So this little table you can buy from 110 bucks or 120 bucks
[02:37:32.520 --> 02:37:41.960]  on Amazon. It's a dentist's vibrating table. I'm going to make the vacuum base fit on and around
[02:37:41.960 --> 02:37:48.520]  this table. Coincidentally enough, when I made the clear plastic ones here that I'm bolting together,
[02:37:49.160 --> 02:37:53.480]  I made it fit within the table thinking, you know, hey, the thing won't dance around.
[02:37:54.360 --> 02:38:00.120]  And this was my thought process. Buy a table, make plates, set box on.
[02:38:01.640 --> 02:38:07.880]  Without all this bullshit, one box, vibrate it down, there's your extraction. Then I started
[02:38:07.880 --> 02:38:15.320]  thinking about that vacuum system. So the bottom plate is going to be made with a vacuum system
[02:38:15.960 --> 02:38:19.960]  with sides that come down so it will not vibrate off this table.
[02:38:19.960 --> 02:38:25.000]  So a handicapped guy like Toad or anyone can literally make it happen.
[02:38:28.120 --> 02:38:34.280]  So we'll show you the invention end of it real quick. Make the lights flash.
[02:38:36.920 --> 02:38:38.680]  And I'm looking for a box.
[02:38:41.320 --> 02:38:42.520]  Oh no, oh there it is.
[02:38:47.320 --> 02:38:54.920]  25 bucks. You want a 12 volt? 25 bucks. A little power pack from Amazon. Mine's from Radio Shack,
[02:38:54.920 --> 02:39:00.440]  but I found the same one. Plugs into a wall, produces 12 volts of power.
[02:39:02.520 --> 02:39:08.120]  My motor, if you buy it from Amazon and bolt it on, you can go out into the wilderness with a car
[02:39:08.840 --> 02:39:14.680]  or 12 volt and make it happen. I need snips. I got to strip these red toolbox.
[02:39:15.880 --> 02:39:23.960]  Yeah, wire cutters. So my idea behind that was, again, no energy. 12 volts, battery,
[02:39:24.680 --> 02:39:32.920]  solar. I won't ever have to spend money to vibrate my hatch. Yes, I have a 120 producer. Yes,
[02:39:33.880 --> 02:39:39.400]  it should plug into a wall, but if I produce these plates, I should say when I produce these
[02:39:39.400 --> 02:39:44.680]  plates, I'm not going to do that. I don't want a UL thing. I don't need liability insurance.
[02:39:44.680 --> 02:39:45.480]  So anyway.
[02:39:52.360 --> 02:39:55.400]  That's fine. So how's that thing doing?
[02:39:59.320 --> 02:40:00.360]  What's it been, 10 minutes?
[02:40:03.240 --> 02:40:09.240]  Don't bring it in. Just bring a tray and take it apart. I want to see what's in that bottom one,
[02:40:09.240 --> 02:40:15.480]  in that black plastic. That's what I'm interested in. So nice having a helper, you guys. I know I'm
[02:40:15.480 --> 02:40:22.360]  eating up time, but I really am excited to show you this because it's so small and it does work.
[02:40:24.440 --> 02:40:35.020]  So about two minutes from now, we'll be good. I was telling Brian on the pre-interview that
[02:40:37.180 --> 02:40:42.460]  you know, surgery, medical stuff, a lot of that is a lot to overcome. And it brings you to a place
[02:40:42.460 --> 02:40:47.740]  you really don't want to be in life. And I was in that place and I found you guys
[02:40:49.740 --> 02:40:57.180]  and I came out of that place. So thank you, Leighton. Thank you, Peter. Thank you, Brian.
[02:40:57.900 --> 02:41:03.980]  And unfortunately, thank you, Frenchie. And thank you to Frenchie's woman for keeping his spirit
[02:41:03.980 --> 02:41:17.350]  alive because without you guys, I might not be here. So about 15 minutes, just sitting there for
[02:41:17.350 --> 02:41:25.830]  what was it? Five minutes, 10 minutes? That's, this is a 177. That's out of a work. What was
[02:41:25.830 --> 02:41:36.310]  this? The bottom one? Yeah. 177. And here's your static tech guys. I rubbed it on my stomach.
[02:41:36.310 --> 02:41:46.560]  It's sticking. Doesn't fucking tap off. There's your static tech. Take a piece of plastic.
[02:41:46.560 --> 02:41:51.280]  Dude, that is wild. That's a little piece of rubber. Go run that.
[02:41:51.280 --> 02:41:57.920]  Static tech usually is very time consuming from, and I know 10% of it, but it seems very time
[02:41:57.920 --> 02:42:03.920]  consuming. I didn't touch any of that. So here we go. Three, two, one.
[02:42:11.620 --> 02:42:13.860]  So if you lift it off the table, it's silent,
[02:42:14.500 --> 02:42:19.220]  but it will sit there and vibrate a little bit. I'll get my camera rolling here.
[02:42:24.340 --> 02:42:30.100]  You want it to be on a hard surface, you guys. If it's not on a hard surface, it's not going to work.
[02:42:32.180 --> 02:42:38.660]  You want resistance. You want those steel bolts to, okay, I'm streaming again, Peter.
[02:42:40.500 --> 02:42:46.260]  Okay. I'm in the show. There we go. So flip it sideways like a TV.
[02:43:03.470 --> 02:43:09.150]  So you can see the concept. Once air is blowing in there, stirring everything around,
[02:43:09.150 --> 02:43:14.190]  the hash is going to vibrate down. If I have a downforce of vacuum, it's just going to
[02:43:14.190 --> 02:43:19.390]  recirculate the whole system. So I'm really excited to get that started. I'm going to have
[02:43:19.390 --> 02:43:24.190]  him set this outside as well and just let it run and see how much of that we can sieve out.
[02:43:25.390 --> 02:43:27.310]  So I'll go off of this camera, Peter.
[02:43:27.390 --> 02:43:30.910]  Same thing. Just take it outside. Let it sit there and bounce around.
[02:43:35.950 --> 02:43:45.380]  I'm here. Now, if I'm able to risk all that, you guys, come on, dispensaries. Come on, Sean.
[02:43:45.380 --> 02:43:51.460]  Come on, Rise. Buy these little things. Make solventless product. They do have one solventless
[02:43:51.460 --> 02:43:57.620]  product there. I will say that, you guys. And it says, I'm going to put it in there.
[02:43:57.940 --> 02:44:14.020]  You guys. And it's sad, but I'm not going to buy a gram of flour rosin for $84 that has a 43% THC
[02:44:14.020 --> 02:44:20.500]  content and no terpenes. That was their one solventless product there. When you ask for
[02:44:20.500 --> 02:44:25.860]  reports, I should get them. If I ask you how a product is produced, like Ares or Air Rise,
[02:44:26.420 --> 02:44:31.780]  that company didn't respond to my emails. The dispensary doesn't have any answers for me. And
[02:44:32.820 --> 02:44:39.620]  now you know why I'm doing all this. Right fucking there. They're lying to you people.
[02:44:40.180 --> 02:44:43.860]  And hopefully this show will give you some ideas, even if you're not me.
[02:44:45.380 --> 02:44:51.060]  If you're under me and you just don't have any of this money, these little sieves are $25.
[02:44:51.380 --> 02:44:58.180]  So sit there and pound it on the ground and make your medicine. It sucks, but you can do it.
[02:45:00.980 --> 02:45:06.260]  Leighton, I have a few questions for you as far as I wanted to get into a microscope level with it,
[02:45:06.260 --> 02:45:09.140]  but we're not going to go there because I didn't get any pipettes.
[02:45:11.220 --> 02:45:14.900]  And I really don't have anything to see if it's alive or not. You know what I mean?
[02:45:14.900 --> 02:45:24.260]  I think you're onto something with this little machine, dude. I said, I think you're onto this
[02:45:24.260 --> 02:45:28.580]  with the little machine. I think you can obviously continue to refine it and stuff,
[02:45:28.580 --> 02:45:36.500]  but it's a cool little concept that I personally haven't really seen anything close to this.
[02:45:36.500 --> 02:45:41.540]  The next thing I'm going to do is take the smallest 12 volt car vacuum,
[02:45:42.260 --> 02:45:49.060]  reroute the exhaust out of it and just make it suck. And if it just sucks, I can also just take
[02:45:49.060 --> 02:45:54.340]  a little keyboard blower to make that hash stir up and not get clogged in that top screen. Just
[02:45:54.340 --> 02:45:59.780]  get a little can and hook it up to the hose and go. Or if you're on a bigger scale, making that
[02:45:59.780 --> 02:46:07.380]  vacuum system with that flower seed you can buy for 200 bucks, little air compressor, you know,
[02:46:07.380 --> 02:46:13.780]  a tank that fills your tire just to go. But then there's a possibility of contamination of oil from
[02:46:13.780 --> 02:46:19.380]  the compressor. So this is why I want some type of vacuum. I bought a little vacuum pump. It's
[02:46:19.380 --> 02:46:24.820]  a vacuum pump that establishes vacuum and keeps it. It's not a recirculating vacuum pump. So
[02:46:25.540 --> 02:46:31.300]  within the next two months, I'll know. The CNC shop is going to cut the first bases and that's
[02:46:31.300 --> 02:46:37.300]  where you start, this vacuum. Then I'll make it recirculate. Again, if anybody wants to work with
[02:46:37.300 --> 02:46:43.540]  me on this, you can call me, but I mailed in a small patent and the first person to get my machine
[02:46:44.740 --> 02:46:54.220]  for free is Bird. If anybody's going to make that thing work, once I cut them
[02:46:55.340 --> 02:47:01.260]  on a mass scale or fucking prove wrong or right and be respected for it, look at that fucking
[02:47:01.260 --> 02:47:08.380]  Instagram account. I ain't got shit. I care less. That man will prove it. He's a champion. So I'm
[02:47:08.380 --> 02:47:15.340]  going to cut these plates. I'm going to send him one. We'll see. And again, from what I see
[02:47:16.380 --> 02:47:25.100]  and I'm just watching, he's the next Frenchie. I'm sorry. He's got it. He's got the temple ball.
[02:47:25.100 --> 02:47:31.660]  He's got the hash. He's got the fucking trophy. So if you're not listening to him on any level,
[02:47:31.660 --> 02:47:37.660]  you're a fool. And you reach back out to me. Who does that? It's like Michael Jordan reaching back
[02:47:37.660 --> 02:47:46.060]  to you. Who does that? Layton, that guy. I do like that analogy. I feel like I've even
[02:47:46.060 --> 02:47:50.940]  kind of used that in a way myself of what other industry really is there where other people,
[02:47:51.020 --> 02:47:55.580]  at least at this point in where we're at, you can reach out to some of the people that are
[02:47:55.580 --> 02:48:01.580]  living legends and they'll get right back to you. It's pretty cool with social media to take it to
[02:48:01.580 --> 02:48:05.980]  that and then to have the platforms because I'm sure a lot of people know, I mean, if you're
[02:48:05.980 --> 02:48:11.020]  making a YouTube channel, it's really hard to get any traction. So to have a platform that,
[02:48:11.900 --> 02:48:17.020]  I don't even know how people find about Future Cannabis Project, but I would imagine it comes
[02:48:17.020 --> 02:48:24.220]  from a variety of different things. But Peter's been doing this long before I felt like this was
[02:48:24.220 --> 02:48:27.180]  where a lot of people were getting their information. I mean, he's been pumping out
[02:48:27.180 --> 02:48:31.740]  content for a really long time. And I feel like now is that fruition. And it's pretty cool to
[02:48:31.740 --> 02:48:37.340]  see how certain things line up where now a gentleman like you can debut something that
[02:48:37.340 --> 02:48:43.740]  is pretty cool, man. I really like the concept and where your head is at. And I would imagine
[02:48:44.380 --> 02:48:49.900]  you reaching out to Bird and him coming on here speaks volumes to where your head is at.
[02:48:50.700 --> 02:48:55.020]  Thank you so much. What was that comment, Peter? What did that guy say? I didn't read it in time.
[02:48:58.000 --> 02:48:59.280]  Did he call me a pilgrim?
[02:49:00.720 --> 02:49:03.440]  Probably. Yeah, it looked like Perida.
[02:49:03.920 --> 02:49:13.840]  Oh, okay. Thank you. And you know what, guys? There's two people, two things, entities I need
[02:49:13.840 --> 02:49:20.160]  to thank. And it's you guys and my offspring, because I wouldn't be here. No bullshit. I'm not
[02:49:20.160 --> 02:49:27.200]  going to go into tears, but I wouldn't be here. Straight up. So. Well, much appreciated, brother.
[02:49:27.200 --> 02:49:30.000]  We're just trying to do the work. Well, it's to help people.
[02:49:31.920 --> 02:49:38.400]  When you watch the Horizon build and the 30-gallon fucking pot,
[02:49:38.640 --> 02:49:46.640]  Leighton, I have your identical shoes. We wear the identical pants. We wear some stupid fucking
[02:49:46.640 --> 02:49:53.200]  shirt. You're me. It's a real person. Thank you for being you, just for fucking being you.
[02:49:53.200 --> 02:49:56.400]  Are you talking about Leighton's white socks and sandals look?
[02:50:01.120 --> 02:50:02.960]  Is that, do you do that at a certain age?
[02:50:03.920 --> 02:50:04.720]  No, that's-
[02:50:04.720 --> 02:50:06.640]  You guys were rocking that in college, right?
[02:50:06.720 --> 02:50:11.360]  I'm wearing sandals because they're comfortable, but it's cold out. My fucking toes are cold.
[02:50:11.360 --> 02:50:12.400]  So guess what?
[02:50:12.400 --> 02:50:16.480]  Leighton, can we get a foot shot? What are we wearing today?
[02:50:17.360 --> 02:50:17.840]  Yes.
[02:50:17.840 --> 02:50:18.720]  Ah, sneakers.
[02:50:21.920 --> 02:50:29.360]  Peter has come a long way because the information he provides, he has learned. You can watch older
[02:50:29.360 --> 02:50:34.080]  videos where Peter is just trying to get it all out there and show everybody. And I watch it,
[02:50:34.160 --> 02:50:39.520]  Leighton, that's Peter. And he goes, yeah, that's a long time ago.
[02:50:41.120 --> 02:50:45.280]  But it's still information. And without those, again, without those videos,
[02:50:46.160 --> 02:50:52.800]  progressing into solventless conversations from Frenchie to now, I mean, I literally remember
[02:50:52.800 --> 02:50:58.400]  Brian being really nervous on the first shows, just doing bongs and, you know,
[02:50:58.640 --> 02:51:03.360]  feeling his way through those shows. And it's like, dude, you got this. You fucking got this.
[02:51:04.560 --> 02:51:09.280]  Yeah. I had a, definitely had a fear of public speaking for a long time,
[02:51:09.280 --> 02:51:12.400]  even when I would do the little Indo expos and stuff. So-
[02:51:12.400 --> 02:51:13.200]  You got this.
[02:51:13.200 --> 02:51:17.760]  What I'm saying, like, everybody's fine in their own little way. And it's unique.
[02:51:17.760 --> 02:51:21.120]  Even the way Leighton and I kind of linked up and how all this came together was just
[02:51:21.120 --> 02:51:24.880]  kind of unique in the way that things were happening. And I think that's what's so
[02:51:24.960 --> 02:51:34.560]  unique about it. But to now have it to where, you know, like behind, you know, the pre-interview or
[02:51:34.560 --> 02:51:39.520]  whatever the way we've been calling it, just the genuineness, I feel like that you take that
[02:51:39.520 --> 02:51:44.480]  information and run with it. That's something that I feel like all three of us would love to see is
[02:51:44.480 --> 02:51:48.400]  just a lot of people taking this and then putting their own spin on it. That's why we're not trying
[02:51:48.400 --> 02:51:55.040]  to, you know, pigeonhole one kind of belief system, you know, like allowing people to kind
[02:51:55.040 --> 02:51:59.680]  of pick and choose so that you can run and create this. Do you have a name for this little system
[02:51:59.680 --> 02:52:00.320]  yet? Or is it-
[02:52:01.120 --> 02:52:03.040]  I Can Sieve.
[02:52:03.040 --> 02:52:04.960]  The Terp Shaker or something, you know, like what-
[02:52:05.840 --> 02:52:07.360]  I Can Sieve.
[02:52:08.320 --> 02:52:09.360]  Sorry, I couldn't hear you, man.
[02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:14.080]  I Can Sieve. I-C-A-N-N Sieve.
[02:52:15.840 --> 02:52:16.160]  Right on.
[02:52:16.160 --> 02:52:17.760]  I was going to say the Twerk Shaker.
[02:52:18.560 --> 02:52:21.680]  Way better name.
[02:52:21.680 --> 02:52:24.960]  So here's your work bin that I shredded everything into, okay?
[02:52:27.920 --> 02:52:34.400]  And that is a 80 micron. Peter, if you can do that conversion on a chart, I think it's 177.
[02:52:35.200 --> 02:52:37.840]  So here's your 177.
[02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:56.110]  To see how much is there, I'll just weigh it up real quick.
[02:52:56.750 --> 02:53:07.590]  So to be clear, you had the machine running in the other room while you were talking to us.
[02:53:07.590 --> 02:53:10.470]  Yeah, this machine was running in the other room in the garage.
[02:53:11.910 --> 02:53:17.990]  And this is, again, this is an outdoor hemp, okay? It's a hemp breed from the hemp that's
[02:53:17.990 --> 02:53:25.670]  been here for 100 years. And it's bred with Skywalker is where I put it. So just running
[02:53:26.630 --> 02:53:35.270]  in that 1.64 grams. I didn't expect much out of it, you guys. It's not of color. It's dark.
[02:53:35.270 --> 02:53:40.950]  You know what I mean? That stuff sat out in a field well past maturity. So I expect this to be
[02:53:40.950 --> 02:53:49.590]  high CBN and be great medicine. But now let's talk about that refinement. Let's talk about that
[02:53:50.550 --> 02:54:04.570]  100 micron static tech. So it's not much, but it's there. And I didn't expect much out of this,
[02:54:04.570 --> 02:54:15.620]  you guys. Again, it's a shit plant. I bet we just got hit with that 18 and up strike with you doing
[02:54:15.620 --> 02:54:24.340]  that right there. But it produces. Look at that. No effort, no dragging of cellophane disc plates,
[02:54:25.060 --> 02:54:31.060]  none of that stuff, you know? So now we'll switch over and see what this thing did.
[02:54:34.020 --> 02:54:38.500]  It probably is going to take a lot longer because I can see some material in the top,
[02:54:38.500 --> 02:54:47.280]  but my God, there's a lot gone. Go ahead and just get all that out of there.
[02:54:48.640 --> 02:54:53.280]  You can see two chunks still in there. So a lot of it's vibrated out, but there's only what?
[02:54:54.240 --> 02:55:02.740]  Gram or two left. And that was a combination of all of your other sifts that you had done.
[02:55:03.460 --> 02:55:14.740]  This is 15 grams of 150 micron hash that's extracted from the pollen extractor. This is a
[02:55:14.740 --> 02:55:21.620]  160 screen. So I would truly expect all of that to fall through in time. But what do we run at? 15
[02:55:21.620 --> 02:55:28.180]  minutes? Okay. So what am I after with this? You guys, I'm not after extracting. I'm after
[02:55:28.180 --> 02:55:37.300]  refinement so that I can get to that pressable micron level with no freeze dryer, no water,
[02:55:37.300 --> 02:55:45.220]  no mold issues. And when I say these things about bird, you don't know. The layman out there does
[02:55:45.220 --> 02:55:51.300]  not fucking know what he fights with moisture and mold and temperature. And he's in SoCal and the
[02:55:51.380 --> 02:55:57.060]  energy bill. I mean, it's a lot. So if anybody ever looks at his products or has anything to
[02:55:57.060 --> 02:56:03.700]  say about it, anybody that does what he does, that's a fucking expense. You guys, it's a lot.
[02:56:03.700 --> 02:56:09.140]  And there's a learning curve and there's a loss. So let's go ahead and take all this out of here.
[02:56:11.060 --> 02:56:17.940]  So there's what's left in our 160. Okay. And I would expect all that to fall through in time,
[02:56:17.940 --> 02:56:36.680]  but goddammit. So this is your 160 that'll fall through in time. And this is your 120.
[02:56:42.320 --> 02:56:50.080]  And underneath that 120, on the plate where the vacuum will be is your 45. So right there,
[02:56:50.560 --> 02:56:59.040]  160, or I'm sorry, that came through the 160, came through the 120, came through the 45.
[02:57:00.640 --> 02:57:10.310]  So I'll clean this up as we talk, but my god, I hope this works, you guys. I mean, that's,
[02:57:11.430 --> 02:57:17.990]  it obviously passed through the screens. Now I just need to decide how I'm going to press it.
[02:57:17.990 --> 02:57:24.630]  How I'm going to press it. So I'm probably not, probably going to run out of time here before we
[02:57:24.630 --> 02:57:31.030]  do that. But I think in my opinion, it works. I mean, I got three piles of ash that just went
[02:57:31.030 --> 02:57:39.910]  through a screen in about 15 minutes. And you know, you're running another 15 minutes, the rest
[02:57:39.910 --> 02:57:44.870]  of that's going to pass through those screens and make the micron sizes. So right here, live on
[02:57:44.870 --> 02:57:52.310]  future cannabis project. You have now seen me extract it in a freezer with $120 machine.
[02:57:53.190 --> 02:57:57.830]  You've now seen me vibrate it to refinement with approximately
[02:57:59.990 --> 02:58:07.270]  $75 worth of parts and my time. So I'm hoping that this teaches some people a lesson,
[02:58:08.070 --> 02:58:13.110]  especially on this refinement level. The other thing, I'll play with it. I'll probably run a
[02:58:13.110 --> 02:58:18.230]  couple ounces of chem through it and see what it really does and get some hard corn numbers.
[02:58:18.230 --> 02:58:24.470]  But right now, dry sieving, I'm extracting eight and a half grams of hash out of an ounce of chem
[02:58:24.470 --> 02:58:31.670]  and 6.7 grams of hash out of elevate gorilla cookies, which I wouldn't expect to get more
[02:58:31.670 --> 02:58:38.070]  than that because it's so tight and hard that in this mode or this mechanical vibration,
[02:58:38.070 --> 02:58:44.790]  I probably won't see more than that. So we got two minutes left on our coconut oil.
[02:58:44.790 --> 02:58:51.030]  That was a big wad of coconut oil. And now I'm going to show you guys after it was infused,
[02:58:51.030 --> 02:58:55.910]  we're going to drain it out. And eventually we'll put it in the freezer. I'm going to hopefully
[02:58:55.910 --> 02:59:02.630]  make it solid again so I can show you on live here, how to make a bone that's going to fight
[02:59:02.630 --> 02:59:11.670]  inflammation. So I got a mess. Bring everybody back there, Peter.
[02:59:18.590 --> 02:59:20.990]  Messes are good, my friend. It means you're doing the work.
[02:59:21.950 --> 02:59:23.310]  I'm covered in hash, Layton.
[02:59:26.110 --> 02:59:32.110]  So the first example that you showed us, what was that again? Was that just shaking
[02:59:32.830 --> 02:59:38.350]  without your little system? The first thing you sent us was a little green, to be honest.
[02:59:38.350 --> 02:59:43.710]  That pollinator, which is basically like a gold tumbler that was in the freezer. That's how I
[02:59:43.710 --> 02:59:48.670]  extract first. I take a one ounce and he's going to grab the frozen ounce right now. I'm going to
[02:59:48.670 --> 02:59:55.710]  show you how I do this. I just grab one ounce frozen and crunch it up. And then I put it in
[02:59:55.710 --> 03:00:02.670]  that trommel, in that pollen extractor. I put it in the freezer. That brings me eight ounces of
[03:00:02.670 --> 03:00:10.990]  hash. This is frozen. Okay. In the bag, it crunches so easily. This is all I do. So this is me
[03:00:10.990 --> 03:00:15.230]  washing in a washing machine right now. I'm breaking it up. I'm making it so that it'll
[03:00:15.230 --> 03:00:20.990]  extract off the buds. I leave the stem in there. I try and get every full spectrum I can because
[03:00:20.990 --> 03:00:28.110]  those stems will act as agitators in that trommel and stir it up. I won't go too long so it doesn't
[03:00:28.110 --> 03:00:32.590]  stick to the bag. It'll go in the freezer again. I'll take it back out frozen just for a couple
[03:00:32.590 --> 03:00:38.350]  seconds and crunch it so it never sticks to that bag. I know that they're not getting warm then.
[03:00:38.990 --> 03:00:41.870]  Crunch it a few times. You put it inside that trommel.
[03:00:42.590 --> 03:00:49.710]  And then it just sieves out inside that little container. It goes like this. And each time goes
[03:00:49.710 --> 03:00:57.470]  and just has a bump and it falls out. Like if you watch Gold Rush, this is a trommel.
[03:00:59.070 --> 03:01:03.480]  Then goes, where's my tray at? Where's the box?
[03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:12.720]  I guess that kind of makes sense why that, the coloring on that and I would imagine the harshness
[03:01:13.040 --> 03:01:21.200]  on that from it doing that. It's just a simple Tupperware box but it stays frozen. It doesn't
[03:01:21.200 --> 03:01:27.360]  get moisture in there. My hash never gets warm or never gets sticky. Always cold, especially in a
[03:01:27.360 --> 03:01:36.800]  freezer. So when these guys talked about extract with alcohol in a freezer, it keeps less chlorophyll
[03:01:36.800 --> 03:01:42.560]  from coming into the solvent. Well, why can't that be applied mechanically?
[03:01:44.240 --> 03:01:50.560]  So this gentleman, I mean I started looking a year ago. I found this gentleman. Three pounds
[03:01:50.560 --> 03:01:57.520]  have run through this $120 machine. So and it's still running. All I did was it ran so hard it
[03:01:57.520 --> 03:02:02.160]  broke the goddamn plastic in half and I just remade it and here we go. It's still trucking.
[03:02:02.160 --> 03:02:07.920]  So I ain't going to change until that breaks or by some miracle Illinois changes laws so we can
[03:02:07.920 --> 03:02:13.200]  grow more product but for the amount of product that I grow, who I am and what I'm doing,
[03:02:13.200 --> 03:02:19.680]  everything that I've shown you here today, there's no reason not to emulate it for yourself as far as
[03:02:21.200 --> 03:02:28.720]  if you want what I want and what I want is health without solvent. I can't say that so much because
[03:02:28.720 --> 03:02:33.120]  it's what you guys are about and the people I talk to that you meet at a grocery store
[03:02:33.120 --> 03:02:39.520]  are the people that you smoke with and stuff. They're not of my liking or not that they're
[03:02:39.520 --> 03:02:46.320]  not of my liking. They're just not in the same mindset. Something I failed to say is my mother
[03:02:46.320 --> 03:02:53.200]  died of cancer. She left my father because of all those problems when I was 14. I went out to
[03:02:54.160 --> 03:02:59.920]  California and I went to high school in Yucca Valley, California. Shout out Bill Emery.
[03:03:03.280 --> 03:03:12.320]  That's the first place I smoked real marijuana was from what they called the shelf, the mesa,
[03:03:12.320 --> 03:03:19.520]  and they always talked about humble and that's what it was. So in 1986, I smoked the best marijuana
[03:03:19.520 --> 03:03:26.480]  I've ever smoked in my life and it was only that I can define it as California green. There's a
[03:03:26.480 --> 03:03:32.560]  reason for that. It's because it's ocean grown. Anybody listening to this, stop thinking that
[03:03:32.560 --> 03:03:39.840]  OG behind the name or it shouldn't be, doesn't mean original gangster. It means ocean grown and
[03:03:39.840 --> 03:03:45.680]  that's where this seed thrived from and thrived in. So you should do your best to emulate those
[03:03:45.680 --> 03:03:50.720]  conditions so that you can get the best out of what it is. There's a reason why I like Elevate.
[03:03:51.360 --> 03:03:58.320]  Elevate's grow houses are in the same longitudinal line as mine. So we see the same environments.
[03:03:58.320 --> 03:04:03.520]  That doesn't mean other cultivars don't produce excellent product, but I'm trying to produce
[03:04:03.520 --> 03:04:09.680]  what's in my region. So anybody growing through Michigan, nobody grows all the way out west of
[03:04:09.680 --> 03:04:15.040]  Seattle, through Colorado is even so bad because of higher elevations, but that's what I seek out
[03:04:15.040 --> 03:04:26.080]  in strains and in certain things. When I was 19, I had a Phototron 1, a Phototron 2, and a Phototron 3.
[03:04:27.360 --> 03:04:34.960]  We grew out of the catalogs from Amsterdam and it was just Skunk 1 and Skunk 2
[03:04:34.960 --> 03:04:40.560]  and Northern Lights and there was like seven names. And from watching all your shows, it's my
[03:04:40.560 --> 03:04:45.200]  understanding that those guys took all those seven names and that's created the genetics we
[03:04:45.200 --> 03:04:52.240]  know today. So where's my California skunk, you guys? Where's that California weed? Do I
[03:04:52.240 --> 03:04:58.880]  literally need to fly there to get it or is there a genetic that reproduces that?
[03:04:59.840 --> 03:05:04.340]  What about later? You were in the 80s.
[03:05:06.740 --> 03:05:07.060]  Yep.
[03:05:09.700 --> 03:05:14.100]  Where is that? Where is that green grass?
[03:05:15.300 --> 03:05:20.740]  Well, unfortunately, you can call it genetic drift. You can call it inbreeding. You can call
[03:05:20.740 --> 03:05:26.580]  it a number of different things. A lot of the really good genetics got taken away during the
[03:05:26.580 --> 03:05:33.300]  war on drugs. There were cultivars that nobody wanted to grow because the skunk smelled so
[03:05:33.300 --> 03:05:38.500]  freaking strong that I don't care if you triple bag it, you're going to get busted with the shit.
[03:05:39.300 --> 03:05:43.460]  So unfortunately, a lot of that was lost, but I think that more and more people are
[03:05:43.460 --> 03:05:50.980]  understanding the value of land races and bringing land races back into regular breeding. I know
[03:05:50.980 --> 03:05:56.580]  Kevin Jodry just did a project. I know there's another gentleman that probably will end up
[03:05:57.220 --> 03:06:03.860]  on this podcast sometime in the near future who's got a tremendous amount of old land race genetics
[03:06:03.860 --> 03:06:08.900]  that he brought back from NAHAM with him. So it's out there. It's just we've got to start
[03:06:09.700 --> 03:06:13.860]  getting smart about the breeding and not just keep breeding, breeding, breeding, breeding,
[03:06:13.860 --> 03:06:17.780]  breeding out because you are going to drift the genetics to some degree.
[03:06:17.780 --> 03:06:25.700]  There's a gentleman I know that's in the UP of Michigan. For 30 years, he's been growing redbud
[03:06:25.700 --> 03:06:31.140]  with worm castings underneath his stairs. I've only seen it. I've never smoked it,
[03:06:31.700 --> 03:06:38.020]  but it's the same stuff. Whatever's in Cali Connection's swerve juice years ago, whatever
[03:06:38.020 --> 03:06:43.380]  those hormones are, he reversed everything and he made seeds and he's made them ever since.
[03:06:43.380 --> 03:06:50.260]  It's those guys that have that knowledge that carry this on. I mean, I might have some experiences,
[03:06:50.260 --> 03:06:55.460]  but I don't have any of that and it's those guys that I'm searching for. So hit me up on my
[03:06:55.460 --> 03:07:01.460]  Instagram. There's a reason why that M2 is here and it's because there's a tie in it and there's
[03:07:01.460 --> 03:07:06.580]  Acapulco Gold in it and I'm trying to get that, trying to get what I know and what I want from
[03:07:06.660 --> 03:07:14.100]  when I was, make myself sound so fucking old when I was a youth and marijuana tasted like that.
[03:07:14.100 --> 03:07:21.460]  You're just trying to revisit that, you know. Closest I've come, bird, temple ball, reminding
[03:07:21.460 --> 03:07:29.380]  me the way. High like you're 15. It's closest I've come. So you've smoked that, so I'm coming close,
[03:07:29.380 --> 03:07:34.180]  but it's just a matter of, you know, getting it right and happy with it. I'm certainly happy with
[03:07:34.180 --> 03:07:44.660]  everything I'm doing now. I want the refinement game. I want it. I want it without a freeze dryer
[03:07:45.220 --> 03:07:49.780]  and I want it to shove it down everybody's throat. Something I wanted to talk about that I forgot to
[03:07:49.780 --> 03:07:56.260]  talk about with bird was you guys that are washing. There's a reason why it's so successful
[03:07:56.980 --> 03:08:04.500]  and it has to do with the trichome head cuticle itself. When I'm doing this, I have hardened,
[03:08:04.500 --> 03:08:13.460]  oxidized trichome heads. It's hard on the outside, but it also doesn't let any oxygen pass through
[03:08:13.460 --> 03:08:20.420]  once it's hard. This is what seals my trichome heads off and lets them do their own jar tech
[03:08:20.420 --> 03:08:25.940]  within each cell. That's on my Instagram where you can see that saucy layer within the cell.
[03:08:27.860 --> 03:08:33.620]  That's why what is key to me making my medicines for me. However, that translates to everyone else.
[03:08:34.740 --> 03:08:40.340]  Let your fucking plants go another week, guys. I don't care how great it tastes. I don't care how
[03:08:40.340 --> 03:08:46.260]  clear you can make your fucking resin. Where's your medicine? Your medicine is in a cured trichome
[03:08:46.260 --> 03:08:55.540]  head. As the elements evolve and make more elements, that's medicine. I hate to be so stiff
[03:08:55.540 --> 03:08:59.860]  about that, but that's medicine. It's called fermenting and you're absolutely right. It's
[03:08:59.860 --> 03:09:06.580]  fermenting into new compounds, more creative, delicate compounds. It's truly fermenting inside
[03:09:06.580 --> 03:09:12.100]  that trichome head? That's the way French explains it. The temple balls themselves,
[03:09:12.100 --> 03:09:15.620]  once they're made, they ferment inside. That's what keeps them.
[03:09:18.180 --> 03:09:22.980]  Inside the cell itself, pull that up, Peter, if you can, on my Instagram, there's a trichome head.
[03:09:23.620 --> 03:09:27.860]  I've never seen that in my fucking life. Actually, the separation is within the head.
[03:09:28.820 --> 03:09:33.700]  I showed that to Bird and Bird said the same thing. Yep, Frenchie talked about that. He had
[03:09:33.700 --> 03:09:39.140]  a lot of conversation that I won't get into, but this is why Bird is the next Frenchie because he
[03:09:39.140 --> 03:09:46.180]  learned so much and was gifted his presence. These are just things I'm seeing and I have to
[03:09:46.180 --> 03:09:50.660]  ask others because I don't know what it is, but certainly you see that fucking Terp sauce
[03:09:50.660 --> 03:09:57.300]  separation, just like everybody's diamonds and sauce and jar tech. It's been in nature, you guys,
[03:09:58.180 --> 03:10:01.860]  for thousands of fucking years. Millions.
[03:10:02.500 --> 03:10:07.380]  I'm not saying that you're reinventing the wheel. You're perfecting this wheel. This
[03:10:07.380 --> 03:10:10.660]  wheel's always been here. You're just perfecting it like I'm trying to here.
[03:10:13.760 --> 03:10:17.920]  Well, dude, this was a really great show today. I think that the audience
[03:10:19.280 --> 03:10:25.120]  probably gobbled up a lot of the information and some of the tricks and techniques you have
[03:10:25.120 --> 03:10:32.240]  are fantastic. It's going to inspire other people to try and play around with this stuff.
[03:10:33.040 --> 03:10:42.000]  It's really funny that in my business, I ended up using 47 microns and 120 microns when I'm
[03:10:42.000 --> 03:10:47.600]  separating out my organisms. That's the same as the fucking tricone bed. Go figure.
[03:10:48.960 --> 03:10:57.680]  Isn't that something? I was thinking about that the other day. It's all a screening effect to
[03:10:57.680 --> 03:11:06.000]  get what you really need. That can be said for media, your life. You guys screen out what you
[03:11:06.000 --> 03:11:13.840]  don't fucking need. If you don't need it, compost it. There you go.
[03:11:13.840 --> 03:11:16.720]  Brian, are you stoned or frozen?
[03:11:19.280 --> 03:11:20.720]  I guess to you, I look stoned.
[03:11:21.120 --> 03:11:28.240]  Look at that saucy fucking turf hat. That's the one that had the division in it. It just
[03:11:28.240 --> 03:11:34.160]  surprised me so much. I sent it over to Bird and he's like, yeah, you're on to it. Just keep going.
[03:11:35.360 --> 03:11:39.200]  When you get inspiration from someone like him, keep doing it. You're on to something. Keep going.
[03:11:39.200 --> 03:11:43.120]  Keep going. Brian's saying you're on to something. How many grows have you seen, dude,
[03:11:43.760 --> 03:11:48.320]  before this fucking show? Coming from you and coming from Leighton on top of Bird,
[03:11:49.120 --> 03:11:52.640]  gives me the great heart to believe I'm doing the right thing. At least
[03:11:53.920 --> 03:11:56.480]  get it into a cartridge. It's the only thing I'm missing, you guys.
[03:11:57.120 --> 03:11:58.160]  Well, you're on your way.
[03:11:58.160 --> 03:12:05.600]  Well, I think a lot of people after they see this will admire your thought process. Then I guess
[03:12:05.600 --> 03:12:12.080]  if you could continue to refine it, I think you might have something. This is how ideas really
[03:12:12.080 --> 03:12:17.280]  begin, man, is letting the world see it, let people critique it, and then maybe refine a few
[03:12:17.280 --> 03:12:21.680]  things and then you're probably on your way. Well, speaking of that, are we bringing Chad in?
[03:12:21.680 --> 03:12:27.520]  I don't have my chat when I'm in this fort, when I'm in StreamYard, so I can't see what
[03:12:27.520 --> 03:12:32.480]  people are talking about. Well, actually, I think we got to wrap it up soon.
[03:12:34.640 --> 03:12:38.640]  I know I've got an afternoon meeting that's really important. I don't know about Peter,
[03:12:38.640 --> 03:12:40.720]  but his kids are probably ready to kill him at this point.
[03:12:41.840 --> 03:12:42.320]  My wife.
[03:12:42.480 --> 03:12:42.880]  My wife.
[03:12:44.880 --> 03:12:52.160]  But let's plan to have you back on in 2022 after you've had some more time to refine some of these
[03:12:52.160 --> 03:12:56.240]  techniques and make those advancements that you're talking about because I think-
[03:12:56.800 --> 03:13:01.760]  That'd be awesome. I'm more than willing to do that. Thank you guys so much again,
[03:13:01.760 --> 03:13:07.600]  it's you three that I see right here with me. I'm your biggest fan, you guys.
[03:13:08.080 --> 03:13:14.000]  So keep going and being who you are and Peter, get a fucking haircut.
[03:13:18.080 --> 03:13:20.560]  Look at that, dude. Yes. I love it.
[03:13:20.560 --> 03:13:22.480]  That one, I think it's more take a shower.
[03:13:23.200 --> 03:13:28.880]  Well, Peter, I can't even see you today. You needed to put more light on, but there you go.
[03:13:30.720 --> 03:13:33.360]  Yeah, your lighting sucks today for whatever reason, but-
[03:13:33.360 --> 03:13:36.720]  You need to do a Dagger shirt shoot with that hair, bro.
[03:13:38.560 --> 03:13:45.600]  Okay. Remember, you guys, liars suck. Don't be one. Stick true to yourself.
[03:13:46.160 --> 03:13:50.640]  Stick true to future cannabis. My God, thank you so much for having me on.
[03:13:51.200 --> 03:13:54.720]  Oh, thanks for coming on, brother. This was a great show and again,
[03:13:54.720 --> 03:13:56.400]  I think the audience really enjoyed it.
[03:13:56.960 --> 03:13:58.160]  Awesome. We will be-
[03:13:58.160 --> 03:14:00.400]  We'll do it again in the new year, for sure.
[03:14:00.400 --> 03:14:02.320]  Okay. Thank you so much, you guys.
[03:14:03.280 --> 03:14:11.200]  I will be showered by tonight's show with Ho-Tha Herb and I'm totally-
[03:14:11.200 --> 03:14:16.160]  Oh, I think we're talking fermentation if I remember correctly, but let me-
[03:14:17.280 --> 03:14:19.200]  I may be totally off on that.
[03:14:19.200 --> 03:14:23.440]  Also, Peter, I'm not watching standard TV anymore, dude. It's just you guys.
[03:14:23.440 --> 03:14:28.560]  There's so much content. Why is anybody that's in the cannabis industry
[03:14:28.640 --> 03:14:32.880]  watching the news to depress you or watching some dumb fucking rerun again?
[03:14:34.240 --> 03:14:36.080]  You can't watch all this content.
[03:14:36.800 --> 03:14:44.240]  My wife watches every variation of Housewives and it drives me crazy.
[03:14:46.320 --> 03:14:52.400]  Keep it up, you guys. Thank you so much again. I truly am blessed for having you guys do this for
[03:14:52.400 --> 03:14:52.900]  me.
[03:14:53.360 --> 03:14:56.720]  Oh, our pleasure, dude. Our pleasure. Glad you can get out there.
[03:14:57.680 --> 03:14:58.400]  Time zone.
[03:14:58.400 --> 03:14:59.200]  Good work, man.
[03:14:59.200 --> 03:15:01.600]  That was 6 p.m. Pacific time.
[03:15:04.080 --> 03:15:04.580]  And then-
[03:15:04.580 --> 03:15:05.440]  All right.
[03:15:05.440 --> 03:15:06.480]  Give me one second.
[03:15:08.880 --> 03:15:10.320]  My mind is fried.
[03:15:11.680 --> 03:15:20.160]  So then tomorrow morning, we have Jim Faust from Clemson and Alison Justice,
[03:15:21.120 --> 03:15:27.840]  who was his PhD student and she's doing a ton of stuff in the hemp world. She was doing-
[03:15:27.840 --> 03:15:33.120]  She was in the legal cannabis market in California. She's a rock star.
[03:15:33.120 --> 03:15:34.080]  And then-
[03:15:34.080 --> 03:15:38.480]  So, sorry. In the morning, Jim Faust is going to give a presentation on the history of the
[03:15:38.480 --> 03:15:47.440]  poinsettia from common Mexican shrub plant to Christmas icon. And then next week, they're
[03:15:47.440 --> 03:15:52.240]  going to come back and talk photo periodism because they've been doing some research
[03:15:53.760 --> 03:16:03.920]  specifically on hemp. And then at 10 a.m., that's also tomorrow, Scott McElroy from
[03:16:03.920 --> 03:16:11.600]  Auburn University is going to do a deep dive into Nikolai Vavilov, who is a Russian Soviet
[03:16:11.600 --> 03:16:16.880]  agronomist back in the Stalin days, botanist and geneticist best known for having identified the
[03:16:16.880 --> 03:16:22.160]  centers of origin of cultivated plants. He devoted his life to the study and improvement
[03:16:22.160 --> 03:16:28.640]  of wheat, maize and other cereal crops that sustain the global population. And for that
[03:16:28.640 --> 03:16:37.760]  work, Stalin threw him in a gulag and he died shortly thereafter. So we're going to get a
[03:16:37.760 --> 03:16:47.200]  history lesson on hemp and grains and cereal crops, which will be kind of cool. So that's
[03:16:48.480 --> 03:16:56.880]  as far as my mind goes for now. But anyway, everyone with that, have a good- What are we?
[03:16:56.880 --> 03:17:02.400]  Thursday? A good Thursday afternoon or whatever time of day it is for you.
[03:17:03.440 --> 03:17:04.560]  Peace out, everybody.
[03:17:04.560 --> 03:17:08.000]  And with that-
