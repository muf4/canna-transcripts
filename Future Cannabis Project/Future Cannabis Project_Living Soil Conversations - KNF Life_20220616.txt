[00:12.430 --> 00:13.370]  these- like I was joking with.

[00:14.430 --> 00:15.370]  yesterday like a mountain man
[00:15.430 --> 00:17.370]  week. Individuals that I admire
[00:17.430 --> 00:19.370]  that are out there. Really in
[00:19.430 --> 00:21.370]  the trenches compared to. How
[00:21.450 --> 00:22.370]  some of us live myself included
[00:22.450 --> 00:24.370]  now you know I'm not. Definitely
[00:24.450 --> 00:26.370]  slitting in the city with zero
[00:26.450 --> 00:29.390]  scape and all this bullshit-
[00:29.390 --> 00:30.890]  but- I'm glad you're here and
[00:30.950 --> 00:32.390]  we're talking about the same
[00:32.450 --> 00:34.390]  things as a lot of a lot of us
[00:34.450 --> 00:36.390]  did- a long time ago so.
[00:36.450 --> 00:37.390]  Excited to have you on the show
[00:37.450 --> 00:38.390]  man I've been joking around

[00:41.470 --> 00:43.390]  bear teeth. That you're- an
[00:43.470 --> 00:44.390]  individual that a lot of people
[00:44.470 --> 00:46.390]  admire because you kind of. You
[00:46.470 --> 00:48.410]  know just out there- making
[00:48.470 --> 00:49.410]  inputs and stuff from what I
[00:49.470 --> 00:51.410]  understand from you know the
[00:51.470 --> 00:53.410]  actual environment that you're
[00:53.470 --> 00:55.410]  living in so. I'm excited that
[00:55.470 --> 00:56.410]  you were able to. Take some
[00:56.470 --> 00:58.410]  time to kind of talk to us man
[00:58.490 --> 01:00.430]  about. You know living in a
[01:00.490 --> 01:02.430]  city compared to what it would
[01:02.510 --> 01:04.430]  seems like- really. Taking in-
[01:04.510 --> 01:06.430]  mother nature and harnessing
[01:06.510 --> 01:09.430]  ways to improve your your- your
[01:09.510 --> 01:11.430]  lifestyle- by kind of going out
[01:11.510 --> 01:13.450]  there and it sounds like- you
[01:13.510 --> 01:14.450]  know. Putting your balls on the
[01:14.510 --> 01:16.450]  table to be honest man killing
[01:16.510 --> 01:22.790]  bears. Yeah man- this- this area
[01:22.850 --> 01:24.790]  of Alaska and Alaska in general
[01:24.850 --> 01:27.790]  definitely- you know promotes
[01:27.870 --> 01:29.870]  these kind of- lifestyles and
[01:29.950 --> 01:32.870]  it's easier to- do it out here
[01:32.950 --> 01:34.870]  especially when all your peers
[01:34.950 --> 01:37.870]  and- and- everyone that you live
[01:37.950 --> 01:39.870]  around and interact with is-
[01:39.950 --> 01:42.790]  also doing the same thing so.
[01:42.850 --> 01:45.790]  It's- I'm grateful to be able to
[01:45.850 --> 01:48.790]  live out here and kind of live
[01:48.850 --> 01:51.790]  this kind of lifestyle. And-
[01:51.850 --> 01:54.790]  and they- the whole K. and F.
[01:54.830 --> 01:57.830]  natural farming grow style just
[01:57.910 --> 01:59.830]  really resonated with me and the
[01:59.910 --> 02:01.830]  lifestyle I live and I like being
[02:01.910 --> 02:05.810]  out in the woods and- and- I
[02:05.870 --> 02:06.810]  don't like spending money on
[02:06.870 --> 02:11.810]  things. So- it's- it's been a
[02:11.890 --> 02:15.810]  great- farming style to really-
[02:15.890 --> 02:18.830]  explore and learn about and- and
[02:18.890 --> 02:20.830]  I'm excited to be here and talk
[02:20.890 --> 02:22.830]  to you guys a little bit about
[02:22.930 --> 02:27.400]  it. Yeah late night- I'm excited
[02:27.460 --> 02:29.400]  about having on our show-
[02:29.480 --> 02:31.400]  because I think you know as time
[02:31.480 --> 02:33.400]  progresses things happen in life
[02:33.480 --> 02:35.400]  the you know wars are started and
[02:35.480 --> 02:37.420]  stuff I think more individuals
[02:37.480 --> 02:38.420]  with the with costs are gonna
[02:38.480 --> 02:40.420]  have to find ways- to cut costs
[02:40.480 --> 02:43.420]  and improve on- on their farming
[02:43.480 --> 02:44.420]  techniques and that kind of stuff
[02:44.480 --> 02:46.420]  so. I know we're preaching to the
[02:46.480 --> 02:48.420]  choir about living soil and K.
[02:48.480 --> 02:50.420]  and F. but- I. You know you're
[02:50.500 --> 02:51.420]  kind of taking it to another
[02:51.500 --> 02:52.420]  level today man when you're
[02:52.500 --> 02:53.420]  talking about- about- about
[02:53.560 --> 02:54.560]  actually going out killing
[02:54.620 --> 02:56.560]  something breaking it down using
[02:56.620 --> 02:58.560]  that ferment- so I hope that this
[02:58.620 --> 03:00.560]  is what might also be- you know
[03:00.620 --> 03:02.560]  informative for individuals that
[03:02.640 --> 03:03.560]  are thinking about more of like
[03:03.640 --> 03:05.560]  prepping or- that kind of
[03:05.640 --> 03:07.560]  lifestyle I can. You know I used
[03:07.640 --> 03:08.580]  to kind of make fun of it but now
[03:08.640 --> 03:09.580]  that I've gotten older I can
[03:09.640 --> 03:10.580]  understand especially from a
[03:10.640 --> 03:12.580]  family standpoint why you would
[03:12.640 --> 03:14.580]  want to have a- a ration of
[03:14.640 --> 03:16.580]  things- ship went south because-
[03:16.640 --> 03:18.580]  you know maybe before- two
[03:18.640 --> 03:20.580]  thousand and one I never thought
[03:20.640 --> 03:21.580]  that that was even possible in
[03:21.820 --> 03:23.820]  our country. Yeah two thousand
[03:23.880 --> 03:26.820]  and one. You make a good point
[03:26.880 --> 03:28.820]  there Brian that's for sure-
[03:28.880 --> 03:30.820]  and yeah you know there's-
[03:30.880 --> 03:32.820]  there's a lot of people you know
[03:32.880 --> 03:33.820]  in back in the east especially
[03:33.900 --> 03:35.820]  like the Pennsylvania area which
[03:35.900 --> 03:37.820]  where they actually take deer
[03:37.900 --> 03:39.840]  carcasses or what's left and
[03:39.900 --> 03:41.840]  they put those in their compost-
[03:41.900 --> 03:43.840]  so there's no reason why not to
[03:43.900 --> 03:45.840]  reuse you know. Things that
[03:45.900 --> 03:47.840]  you've harvested from nature and
[03:47.900 --> 03:49.840]  kind of going back to the way
[03:50.200 --> 03:52.200]  that the ancestors live so you
[03:52.280 --> 03:54.200]  know deep ups to you brother for
[03:54.280 --> 03:56.200]  what you're doing up there where
[03:56.280 --> 03:58.220]  are you in Alaska like- can you
[03:58.280 --> 04:00.220]  give us kind of a general idea.
[04:00.280 --> 04:03.220]  Yeah absolutely so- we're based
[04:03.280 --> 04:07.220]  in- Talkeetna Alaska. And it's
[04:07.280 --> 04:10.220]  about- two hours and fifteen
[04:10.300 --> 04:12.220]  minutes north of Anchorage which
[04:12.300 --> 04:16.220]  is the biggest city in Alaska-
[04:16.300 --> 04:18.740]  so- it's a small little town
[04:19.240 --> 04:21.140]  about a thousand people year
[04:21.200 --> 04:23.140]  around residents- that
[04:23.200 --> 04:25.140]  population increases to about
[04:25.200 --> 04:27.140]  two thousand to twenty five
[04:27.200 --> 04:29.140]  hundred with the influx of
[04:29.220 --> 04:32.140]  summer workers. This town really
[04:32.220 --> 04:34.140]  comes alive from May fifteenth
[04:34.220 --> 04:37.660]  to September fifteenth as we get-
[04:37.720 --> 04:39.660]  tons and tons of tourists that
[04:39.720 --> 04:42.660]  come through- this town is right
[04:42.720 --> 04:45.160]  on the confluence of three major
[04:45.220 --> 04:47.160]  glacier fed Alaskan river
[04:47.660 --> 04:50.580]  systems. So there's a lot of
[04:50.660 --> 04:52.580]  opportunity for exploring the
[04:52.660 --> 04:55.600]  water systems and rafting and-
[04:55.660 --> 04:57.600]  we're also right at the base of
[04:57.660 --> 04:59.600]  the Alaska range so anyone that's
[04:59.660 --> 05:02.600]  coming to Talkeetna to- climb
[05:02.660 --> 05:05.600]  Denali- come to Alaska to climb
[05:05.660 --> 05:07.600]  Denali has to come through
[05:07.680 --> 05:09.600]  Talkeetna. And register at a
[05:09.680 --> 05:11.600]  ranger station and fly out of
[05:11.680 --> 05:14.620]  our airport here- so we get all
[05:14.680 --> 05:16.620]  sorts of adventure in the
[05:16.640 --> 05:19.080]  people coming through here and-
[05:19.140 --> 05:22.080]  it really is a cool little fun
[05:22.140 --> 05:25.080]  quirky fun- town of people
[05:25.160 --> 05:27.080]  like minded people that like to
[05:27.160 --> 05:29.080]  grow their own food hunt their
[05:29.160 --> 05:32.100]  own me and adventure a lot of
[05:32.160 --> 05:36.100]  adventure around here. So let's
[05:36.160 --> 05:38.100]  kind of get into more of you
[05:38.160 --> 05:40.100]  know what what is the scene
[05:40.160 --> 05:42.100]  cannabis scene in Alaska you
[05:42.160 --> 05:43.100]  know I it for me personally
[05:43.160 --> 05:45.100]  it's always been some kind of
[05:45.160 --> 05:47.060]  hearsay thing where. Everybody
[05:47.120 --> 05:48.060]  only talks about Alaskan
[05:48.120 --> 05:50.060]  thunderfuck and that's like the
[05:50.120 --> 05:52.060]  only thing that you know you
[05:52.120 --> 05:54.060]  ever hear- so. You know more on
[05:54.140 --> 05:55.060]  the scene what what kind of
[05:55.140 --> 05:56.060]  genetics are being run through
[05:56.140 --> 05:57.060]  there and you know what what are
[05:57.140 --> 05:59.060]  you guys finding that works for
[05:59.140 --> 06:01.080]  your environment. I would
[06:01.140 --> 06:04.080]  imagine it's pretty unique up
[06:04.140 --> 06:07.080]  there. Yes so- Alaska's had a
[06:07.140 --> 06:10.080]  unique- relationship with
[06:10.140 --> 06:13.080]  cannabis for a lot of years- for
[06:13.140 --> 06:15.140]  one we're so far north from
[06:15.200 --> 06:19.140]  Mexico that. That we never had
[06:19.200 --> 06:22.140]  brick weed up here- I saw it
[06:22.200 --> 06:24.140]  when I would go down south but-
[06:24.220 --> 06:27.140]  since nineteen seventy five or-
[06:27.220 --> 06:32.160]  the mid seventies we had a-
[06:32.220 --> 06:34.160]  raven verse Alaska go through
[06:34.220 --> 06:37.160]  our Supreme Court and- ruled
[06:37.220 --> 06:39.160]  that you were allowed to have up
[06:39.220 --> 06:40.160]  to an ounce in your in your
[06:40.220 --> 06:42.160]  house. And ever since then
[06:42.320 --> 06:45.220]  the- the cops didn't really.
[06:45.280 --> 06:48.220]  Persecute cannabis users so
[06:48.280 --> 06:50.220]  much so in the early days you'd
[06:50.280 --> 06:52.220]  see a lot of like blueberries
[06:52.300 --> 06:54.220]  and northern lights and- and
[06:54.300 --> 06:56.220]  stuff like that going around
[06:56.300 --> 06:59.240]  and- it was always really good
[06:59.300 --> 07:01.240]  and top notch sometimes it
[07:01.300 --> 07:04.240]  wasn't always. You know dried
[07:04.300 --> 07:07.240]  and cured properly per se but
[07:07.300 --> 07:09.240]  as things have morphed into the
[07:09.400 --> 07:12.400]  rec market- I feel like the
[07:12.460 --> 07:15.400]  quality has gone down. So I
[07:15.460 --> 07:18.400]  don't know if it's more people
[07:18.460 --> 07:20.400]  that don't have experience with
[07:20.480 --> 07:22.400]  cannabis that are getting into
[07:22.480 --> 07:25.420]  the market and- and- and grow
[07:25.480 --> 07:29.420]  and- cannabis is not good or if
[07:29.480 --> 07:31.420]  it's not. You know being taken
[07:31.480 --> 07:35.420]  care of- posts- sell or
[07:35.480 --> 07:37.420]  whatever. But I think that
[07:37.640 --> 07:38.640]  the only way to get good
[07:38.700 --> 07:40.640]  cannabis I feel like up here is
[07:40.700 --> 07:43.640]  to find- old had that that or
[07:43.720 --> 07:46.640]  grow it yourself- I can't say
[07:46.720 --> 07:48.640]  that I've ever had one good
[07:48.720 --> 07:51.160]  experience going to a rec store
[07:51.220 --> 07:53.160]  here which I don't do very often
[07:53.220 --> 07:55.160]  so I don't have a ton of
[07:55.220 --> 07:57.160]  experience- but Alaska's
[07:57.220 --> 08:00.160]  climates pretty tough- you know
[08:00.220 --> 08:03.160]  we had snows out in our yard
[08:03.240 --> 08:07.160]  today- and- and- and- and
[08:07.980 --> 08:09.980]  we're gonna have to work hard
[08:10.040 --> 08:12.980]  till May fifteenth this year-
[08:13.040 --> 08:16.980]  so. We have lots of sunlight in
[08:17.060 --> 08:18.980]  the summertime so you can't grow
[08:19.060 --> 08:20.980]  photo periods by the time that
[08:21.060 --> 08:22.980]  plants will start flowering in
[08:23.060 --> 08:26.020]  Alaska. It's- September
[08:26.100 --> 08:27.020]  fifteenth and by that point
[08:27.100 --> 08:30.000]  we're dipping below freezing at
[08:30.060 --> 08:33.000]  night. So unless you're pulling
[08:33.060 --> 08:35.000]  tarps you can't grow photo
[08:35.060 --> 08:37.000]  periods out here hence the name
[08:37.000 --> 08:39.840]  of the plant. I grow a lot of
[08:39.920 --> 08:41.840]  autoflowers in the summertime
[08:41.920 --> 08:43.840]  because it's you know it's free
[08:43.920 --> 08:46.860]  no lights no anything- when I
[08:46.920 --> 08:49.860]  actually first found out about
[08:49.920 --> 08:52.860]  autoflowers I was. Really blown
[08:52.920 --> 08:55.860]  away- because for you know a
[08:55.920 --> 08:57.860]  couple decades I was under the
[08:57.920 --> 08:59.860]  impression that I couldn't grow
[08:59.940 --> 09:01.860]  a cannabis plant out on
[09:01.940 --> 09:04.860]  outside- all that's changed now
[09:04.940 --> 09:06.880]  the quality of genetics has gone
[09:06.880 --> 09:09.760]  up- and- and- and- and- and- and
[09:09.820 --> 09:11.760]  I can grow- comparable
[09:11.820 --> 09:13.760]  autoflowers outside here in a-
[09:13.820 --> 09:18.760]  in a three month cycle- similar
[09:18.840 --> 09:20.760]  to some of the photo periods
[09:20.840 --> 09:22.760]  you're getting outside now so.
[09:22.840 --> 09:24.760]  The autoflowers have really
[09:24.840 --> 09:27.780]  changed the outdoor cannabis-
[09:27.840 --> 09:30.780]  growing up here and- and I'll
[09:30.840 --> 09:31.780]  tell you what I've been very
[09:31.840 --> 09:36.780]  grateful for that so. Are you-
[09:36.780 --> 09:38.680]  are you- are you- are you- are
[09:38.760 --> 09:40.680]  you- are you- are you- are you
[09:40.760 --> 09:42.680]  doing the same genetics that you
[09:42.760 --> 09:44.680]  that you know up there. Are they
[09:44.760 --> 09:46.700]  running autos are you having to
[09:46.760 --> 09:48.700]  reach out to some of the newer
[09:48.760 --> 09:50.700]  breeders that- are kind of.
[09:50.760 --> 09:52.700]  Dialing in the autos for the
[09:52.760 --> 09:54.700]  industry them. Themselves
[09:54.760 --> 09:56.700]  absolutely there are a lot of
[09:56.760 --> 09:58.700]  old timers that have been
[09:58.760 --> 10:00.700]  working some auto screens and-
[10:00.780 --> 10:02.700]  and I've played with some of
[10:02.780 --> 10:04.700]  them- there are climate ties
[10:04.700 --> 10:06.640]  they've been building up these
[10:06.700 --> 10:08.640]  lines with with older genetics
[10:08.700 --> 10:10.640]  and- I find that that some of
[10:10.700 --> 10:12.640]  the best auto flowering
[10:12.700 --> 10:14.640]  genetics are the stuff that's
[10:14.700 --> 10:16.640]  being produced right now that's
[10:16.700 --> 10:18.640]  being and being bred to some of
[10:18.720 --> 10:20.640]  these really nice photo period
[10:20.720 --> 10:22.640]  lines and then and then being
[10:22.720 --> 10:24.660]  inbred out to F4 until it's
[10:24.720 --> 10:27.660]  fully auto and- and so yes there
[10:27.720 --> 10:29.660]  are old timers that are growing
[10:29.720 --> 10:31.660]  these acclimatized- are breeding
[10:31.720 --> 10:33.660]  these acclimatized strains up
[10:33.680 --> 10:35.620]  but I'm trying to work with the
[10:35.680 --> 10:37.620]  the newer stuff that's coming
[10:37.700 --> 10:40.620]  out that you know that is-
[10:40.700 --> 10:45.640]  turpy that's- resinous- you know
[10:45.700 --> 10:49.640]  good structure quick finish time-
[10:49.700 --> 10:51.640]  to have something that will
[10:51.700 --> 10:52.640]  really perform in this
[10:52.700 --> 10:56.640]  environment around here- it's
[10:56.720 --> 10:58.640]  hard to have it go past eighty
[10:58.720 --> 11:02.640]  days- you know and that's with
[11:02.700 --> 11:04.600]  starting it a couple weeks early
[11:04.660 --> 11:06.600]  inside if you're going to start
[11:06.660 --> 11:08.600]  it outside you need a sixty day
[11:08.660 --> 11:11.600]  auto strain to have it finished
[11:11.680 --> 11:14.600]  before the rains in August start
[11:14.680 --> 11:16.600]  we get rains all of August and
[11:16.680 --> 11:18.620]  then boom it starts dropping to
[11:18.680 --> 11:20.620]  freezing in September so we have
[11:20.680 --> 11:23.620]  a very narrow window for- to
[11:23.680 --> 11:26.620]  really succeed with an out out
[11:26.680 --> 11:29.620]  door cannabis grow and- and that
[11:29.640 --> 11:32.600]  narrow margin makes it very hard
[11:32.680 --> 11:34.600]  for for new people to be
[11:34.680 --> 11:37.620]  successful to be honest but- once
[11:37.680 --> 11:38.620]  you start understanding the
[11:38.680 --> 11:40.620]  window that you have to operate
[11:40.680 --> 11:42.620]  and you can pull it off pretty
[11:42.680 --> 11:46.620]  successfully- but the old time
[11:46.680 --> 11:49.620]  heads you know they- they're out
[11:49.700 --> 11:51.620]  here pulling tarps or- or got
[11:51.700 --> 11:55.640]  greenhouses with light depths- you
[11:55.700 --> 11:57.640]  still see that old school
[11:57.720 --> 12:00.720]  mentality of auto flower suck-
[12:00.800 --> 12:03.720]  around here with a lot of those
[12:03.800 --> 12:06.700]  old time growers. Because they
[12:06.760 --> 12:09.700]  did and- and things have changed
[12:09.760 --> 12:13.700]  now. Yeah we were- I'm sorry
[12:13.760 --> 12:15.700]  late. I was just gonna ask why
[12:15.760 --> 12:17.700]  aren't there more indoor grows
[12:17.780 --> 12:19.700]  up there. There's lots of indoor
[12:19.780 --> 12:22.720]  grows here there's indoor grows
[12:22.780 --> 12:24.720]  everywhere there's always been
[12:24.860 --> 12:27.860]  indoor grows here- you know- mom
[12:27.940 --> 12:30.860]  and pops likes- Gramps- with a
[12:30.940 --> 12:33.880]  single one lighter in a closet
[12:33.940 --> 12:35.880]  there's there's always been
[12:35.940 --> 12:37.880]  growth grows all over the place
[12:37.940 --> 12:39.880]  there's people out here with
[12:39.940 --> 12:42.880]  buried con axes like. In so yes
[12:42.940 --> 12:45.880]  don't get me wrong there's-
[12:45.960 --> 12:47.880]  there's definitely- year round
[12:47.960 --> 12:50.880]  lots of- indoor cultivation going
[12:50.960 --> 12:52.880]  on constantly in the state of
[12:53.120 --> 12:55.120]  Alaska. Always has been always
[12:55.180 --> 12:57.120]  will- there's this cool idea
[12:57.200 --> 12:59.120]  kind of- in Alaska once you get
[12:59.200 --> 13:01.120]  outside of Anchorage you know
[13:01.200 --> 13:03.120]  it's that good old- idea that
[13:03.200 --> 13:06.140]  was lost decades ago and lower
[13:06.200 --> 13:09.140]  forty eights where you mind your
[13:09.200 --> 13:11.140]  own business and people leave
[13:11.200 --> 13:14.140]  you alone. You know don't bother
[13:14.200 --> 13:16.140]  your- you know don't be a bad
[13:16.200 --> 13:18.140]  person don't be stealing don't
[13:18.220 --> 13:20.140]  be hurting people don't be
[13:20.140 --> 13:22.380]  hurting people and do whatever
[13:22.440 --> 13:24.380]  you want on your own property
[13:24.440 --> 13:27.380]  because it's your own place and
[13:27.460 --> 13:30.380]  it's- it's this kind of. Old way
[13:30.460 --> 13:33.380]  of thinking that still really
[13:33.460 --> 13:36.400]  permeates and resonates through
[13:36.460 --> 13:39.400]  the Alaskan culture up here- so
[13:39.460 --> 13:42.400]  don't ask don't tell there's
[13:42.460 --> 13:44.400]  growers all over the place.
[13:44.460 --> 13:47.400]  Sounds like heaven brother.
[13:47.400 --> 13:50.640]  We have not in my backyard or
[13:50.700 --> 13:54.640]  NIMBY here. Yeah I think I think
[13:54.700 --> 13:56.640]  the culture especially when is
[13:56.700 --> 13:58.640]  more of an underground scene-
[13:58.700 --> 13:59.640]  you know people didn't want to
[13:59.720 --> 14:00.640]  fuck each other over because
[14:00.720 --> 14:02.640]  really hard to find. People that
[14:02.720 --> 14:04.640]  you know you can really connect
[14:04.720 --> 14:05.660]  with that might be able to get
[14:05.720 --> 14:07.660]  you more than like a Q. P. or
[14:07.720 --> 14:09.660]  least in my world. You know
[14:09.720 --> 14:10.660]  trying to get like several
[14:10.720 --> 14:12.660]  pounds there was very few people
[14:12.720 --> 14:14.660]  that you were able to. Reach out
[14:14.720 --> 14:16.660]  to and- and talk to and- and
[14:17.020 --> 14:18.020]  reach out to on a consistent
[14:18.100 --> 14:19.020]  basis so why would you want to
[14:19.100 --> 14:21.020]  fuck them over. And that kind of
[14:21.100 --> 14:23.020]  created this camaraderie when
[14:23.100 --> 14:24.540]  you- start feeding each other's
[14:24.600 --> 14:26.040]  families are feeding each other
[14:26.100 --> 14:27.040]  you know as an individual like
[14:27.100 --> 14:29.040]  that you know you. I just
[14:29.100 --> 14:30.040]  remember like hanging out with
[14:30.100 --> 14:32.040]  people we always joke like
[14:32.100 --> 14:33.040]  playing a few games of Madden
[14:33.100 --> 14:34.040]  and stuff like that was you
[14:34.100 --> 14:36.040]  know part of part of it that
[14:36.120 --> 14:38.040]  there was just. A connection you
[14:38.120 --> 14:40.040]  need a connection and then from
[14:40.120 --> 14:42.040]  the legal aspect I personally
[14:42.120 --> 14:43.060]  seen where that's the exact
[14:43.120 --> 14:45.060]  opposite it's it's everybody's
[14:45.060 --> 14:46.460]  looking to just find out what
[14:46.520 --> 14:47.460]  they can for themselves fuck
[14:47.520 --> 14:50.460]  everything else. Not it. I
[14:50.520 --> 14:52.460]  would say for like 5% of the
[14:52.540 --> 14:53.460]  people that I've come across
[14:53.540 --> 14:55.960]  are genuinely in this- and I
[14:56.040 --> 14:56.960]  feel like a lot of them are on
[14:57.040 --> 14:58.460]  the future cannabis project
[14:58.540 --> 14:59.480]  where they genuinely just want
[14:59.540 --> 15:02.480]  to educate- they're not gaining
[15:02.540 --> 15:03.480]  anything financially from even
[15:03.540 --> 15:05.480]  doing it- and that's what
[15:05.540 --> 15:06.480]  continues to take this
[15:06.540 --> 15:08.480]  community to the next level and
[15:08.540 --> 15:09.980]  I'm glad to hear in Alaska that
[15:10.040 --> 15:11.480]  there's more of that as a
[15:11.540 --> 15:12.480]  lifestyle because that's
[15:12.560 --> 15:14.980]  something that. I think
[15:15.060 --> 15:15.980]  I've said many times the
[15:16.060 --> 15:17.980]  latency probably said and that
[15:18.060 --> 15:19.980]  part of the aspect for legal
[15:20.060 --> 15:21.000]  cannabis is missing and if it
[15:21.060 --> 15:22.000]  was there I think we'd be a
[15:22.060 --> 15:24.000]  more powerful community as a
[15:24.060 --> 15:27.000]  whole- and- I don't know if you
[15:27.060 --> 15:28.000]  never experienced it I guess it
[15:28.060 --> 15:29.000]  doesn't really matter to you
[15:29.060 --> 15:30.000]  but if you if you've grown up
[15:30.060 --> 15:32.000]  in that era where- everything
[15:32.060 --> 15:34.000]  was always hush hush. It it
[15:34.080 --> 15:36.000]  really was a bond- there was
[15:36.080 --> 15:38.000]  something that you know you
[15:38.080 --> 15:39.000]  treasured because it was a way
[15:39.080 --> 15:42.020]  to- make a hard way to make it
[15:42.080 --> 15:47.820]  easy living. Yeah I agree with
[15:47.880 --> 15:49.820]  you on a percent right and I
[15:49.880 --> 15:51.820]  know. You know a lot of the
[15:51.880 --> 15:53.820]  oldie old growers. We'll say
[15:53.880 --> 15:56.820]  the same thing that there was.
[15:56.900 --> 15:58.820]  Some unwritten rules that were
[15:58.900 --> 16:00.820]  followed. This doesn't seem to
[16:00.900 --> 16:03.840]  be the way anymore I. Lost a
[16:03.900 --> 16:04.840]  lot of hope humanity for a lot
[16:04.900 --> 16:07.840]  of reasons but- for sure you
[16:07.900 --> 16:08.840]  know that you know the suits
[16:08.900 --> 16:10.840]  get involved in legalizing
[16:10.900 --> 16:11.840]  cannabis and shit is really
[16:11.900 --> 16:14.840]  changed- dramatically so- you
[16:14.900 --> 16:15.840]  know it's good to get guys like
[16:15.920 --> 16:17.840]  this on here that you know
[16:17.920 --> 16:18.840]  they're still in the business
[16:18.920 --> 16:21.840]  and they still have some- you
[16:21.920 --> 16:23.860]  know basic. I always say this
[16:23.920 --> 16:25.860]  morals and standards like I
[16:25.920 --> 16:26.860]  won't rat on you don't rat on
[16:26.920 --> 16:28.860]  me I whatever I want to do on
[16:28.920 --> 16:29.860]  my land I can do it you know
[16:29.920 --> 16:34.860]  that's- the way it should be.
[16:34.940 --> 16:36.860]  Yeah the thing is we got a
[16:36.940 --> 16:38.860]  broken system from the top to
[16:38.940 --> 16:40.880]  the bottom everything from our
[16:40.940 --> 16:43.880]  food to our medicine to our
[16:43.960 --> 16:45.900]  agriculture. Every single
[16:45.960 --> 16:48.900]  aspect of our everyday lives
[16:48.960 --> 16:50.900]  is broken and it's wrong and
[16:50.960 --> 16:52.900]  it's false. All the way down to
[16:52.960 --> 16:54.900]  the soil and the way we're
[16:54.980 --> 16:57.900]  growing things and- and- I
[16:57.980 --> 16:59.900]  always kind of felt that ever
[16:59.980 --> 17:01.920]  since I was a kid like there's
[17:01.980 --> 17:02.920]  there's something wrong with
[17:02.980 --> 17:04.920]  what's going on here so as soon
[17:04.980 --> 17:07.920]  as I was. You know old enough
[17:07.980 --> 17:10.920]  to make my own choices and- and
[17:10.960 --> 17:12.960]  off of all my my legal troubles
[17:13.040 --> 17:14.960]  that happened off and on my
[17:15.040 --> 17:16.960]  whole life for cannabis I
[17:17.040 --> 17:19.940]  finally was like. This I'm
[17:20.000 --> 17:21.940]  moving to the woods where no
[17:22.000 --> 17:24.940]  one can tell me how to live my
[17:25.000 --> 17:27.940]  life and- and just practice
[17:28.020 --> 17:30.940]  this subsistence lifestyle that
[17:31.020 --> 17:32.960]  you know really spits in the
[17:33.020 --> 17:35.960]  face of this current. Fake
[17:36.020 --> 17:37.960]  system that's been established
[17:38.020 --> 17:39.960]  over the last couple hundred
[17:39.960 --> 17:45.980]  years. So. Did you grow up up
[17:46.040 --> 17:49.980]  there. Give us a good idea that
[17:50.040 --> 17:51.980]  grew up. Yeah yeah so I was
[17:52.040 --> 17:54.980]  born in Anchorage and- I- grew
[17:55.040 --> 17:57.980]  up up here but also spent half
[17:58.060 --> 17:59.980]  my time in Phoenix Arizona so I
[18:00.060 --> 18:01.980]  got introduced to both both
[18:02.060 --> 18:05.000]  lifestyles and- that probably
[18:05.060 --> 18:09.000]  helped me- understand like. The
[18:09.100 --> 18:11.040]  people were living up here and
[18:11.100 --> 18:14.040]  maybe gave me an idea. As to
[18:14.100 --> 18:16.040]  what was going on with the
[18:16.120 --> 18:20.040]  world so- so yeah Anchorage was
[18:20.120 --> 18:24.060]  my home they say. That you can
[18:24.120 --> 18:26.060]  drive fifteen minutes in either
[18:26.120 --> 18:28.060]  direction of Anchorage and- and
[18:28.120 --> 18:30.060]  reach Alaska so most people
[18:30.120 --> 18:33.060]  don't really consider Anchorage.
[18:33.120 --> 18:38.060]  Alaska but- when I moved out of.
[18:38.200 --> 18:40.120]  Anchorage when I was eighteen I
[18:40.200 --> 18:42.140]  went down to a couple states.
[18:42.200 --> 18:45.140]  That the that still treated
[18:45.200 --> 18:48.140]  cannabis like it was- meth or
[18:48.200 --> 18:53.140]  heroin. And once I got in the
[18:53.200 --> 18:54.140]  system it was really hard for
[18:54.200 --> 18:57.140]  them to let me go so for almost.
[18:57.220 --> 18:58.140]  Nine years I was just
[18:58.220 --> 19:02.140]  constantly. Battling different
[19:02.220 --> 19:05.160]  cases and on and off probation
[19:05.320 --> 19:12.300]  and- and yeah so I- really
[19:12.360 --> 19:15.300]  wanted to get to get back to a
[19:15.360 --> 19:17.300]  place that was that was more
[19:17.360 --> 19:20.300]  accepting and start to you know
[19:20.380 --> 19:23.300]  really. Get to know this plant
[19:23.380 --> 19:26.320]  and work with it and cultivate
[19:26.380 --> 19:28.320]  it and breed it and develop a
[19:28.380 --> 19:31.320]  relationship with it and- and so
[19:31.380 --> 19:33.320]  that's where I'm at now it's
[19:33.540 --> 19:36.540]  kind of really taken me- I
[19:36.620 --> 19:39.560]  appreciate the cannabis industry
[19:39.620 --> 19:41.560]  because it's what introduced me
[19:41.620 --> 19:44.560]  to this natural farming-
[19:44.620 --> 19:47.560]  lifestyle and- and I've really
[19:47.620 --> 19:50.560]  embraced it wholeheartedly and
[19:50.620 --> 19:52.560]  it kind of permeates and to a
[19:52.640 --> 19:54.560]  lot of other aspects of your
[19:54.640 --> 19:56.560]  life once you start utilizing
[19:56.640 --> 20:00.080]  it. And I'm really looking
[20:00.900 --> 20:03.900]  forward to- talking about some
[20:03.980 --> 20:05.900]  of these things that I've
[20:05.980 --> 20:07.900]  learned because I feel like I
[20:07.980 --> 20:11.920]  got a unique perspective- on
[20:11.980 --> 20:14.920]  this natural farming then- then
[20:14.980 --> 20:17.920]  almost anyone else that I- talk
[20:17.980 --> 20:19.920]  to that practices the style and
[20:19.980 --> 20:21.920]  I think one of the reasons why
[20:22.000 --> 20:22.920]  is because there's almost no
[20:23.000 --> 20:24.920]  information on using this stuff
[20:25.000 --> 20:26.920]  for cannabis all the information
[20:27.000 --> 20:29.940]  that like- Chris trump puts out
[20:29.960 --> 20:32.800]  and a lot of people pair it from
[20:32.860 --> 20:34.800]  what he's putting out are- are
[20:34.860 --> 20:36.800]  not- it's not information based
[20:36.860 --> 20:39.800]  around cannabis. Cannabis is an
[20:39.880 --> 20:42.800]  extremely nutrient demanding
[20:42.880 --> 20:44.800]  crop and when you're out there
[20:44.880 --> 20:46.800]  growing lettuces or you know
[20:46.880 --> 20:49.820]  like you know other field crops
[20:49.880 --> 20:51.820]  you know you don't even need a
[20:51.880 --> 20:53.820]  fraction of the nutrient demands
[20:53.880 --> 20:57.820]  that cannabis does. So over the
[20:58.780 --> 21:00.680]  past. Three years of practice in
[21:00.740 --> 21:03.680]  this I've I've really- come to
[21:03.740 --> 21:05.680]  have a good idea and I'm looking
[21:05.740 --> 21:07.680]  forward to sharing some of my-
[21:07.740 --> 21:10.680]  thoughts with you guys today.
[21:10.760 --> 21:12.680]  Cool and you know what we down
[21:12.760 --> 21:16.700]  in Arizona down there for school.
[21:16.760 --> 21:18.700]  My pops moved down there- for
[21:18.760 --> 21:21.700]  work and- and yeah so I was just
[21:21.760 --> 21:23.700]  going back and forth between
[21:23.760 --> 21:25.700]  Alaska and go down to Arizona
[21:25.760 --> 21:27.700]  live on my pops and I'll tell
[21:27.720 --> 21:31.580]  you what. I did not like it very
[21:31.660 --> 21:35.580]  much. You're hot down there and-
[21:35.660 --> 21:38.600]  and too many people. I was gonna
[21:38.660 --> 21:41.600]  ask you because that's what
[21:41.660 --> 21:44.600]  extreme. Arizona the bucket
[21:44.660 --> 21:48.600]  Alaska. Shock yep you're right
[21:48.660 --> 21:50.600]  there in L. A. late and you know
[21:50.680 --> 21:54.600]  what I mean. People. Just ask you
[21:54.680 --> 21:56.620]  the culture at ASU talk about
[21:57.600 --> 21:59.540]  that. Yeah my my daughter
[21:59.600 --> 22:01.540]  actually went to ASU and I
[22:01.600 --> 22:03.540]  worked with Fitzy down at U. of
[22:03.600 --> 22:06.540]  A. so I saw both sides of it and
[22:06.600 --> 22:08.540]  you know. But all that all
[22:08.600 --> 22:09.540]  different times of the year it
[22:09.600 --> 22:11.540]  was it was a cook cooker down
[22:11.620 --> 22:12.540]  there and it's you know during
[22:12.620 --> 22:13.540]  the summer was like being in a
[22:13.620 --> 22:16.540]  convection of horrible. Fucking
[22:16.620 --> 22:18.560]  horrible. So I don't know I had
[22:18.620 --> 22:20.560]  to ask that question because you
[22:20.620 --> 22:24.560]  do you. To extremes for sure.
[22:24.560 --> 22:28.500]  That's for sure. So before we go
[22:28.580 --> 22:30.500]  into deep talk to me about
[22:30.580 --> 22:32.500]  autoflowers because I from what
[22:32.580 --> 22:33.500]  I understand they they are not
[22:33.580 --> 22:36.480]  nutrient pigs. They're true to
[22:36.540 --> 22:41.480]  that. Yes I mean there is
[22:41.560 --> 22:43.480]  definitely truth to that with
[22:43.560 --> 22:46.480]  within reason they eat more than
[22:46.560 --> 22:50.500]  they used to you know at as time
[22:50.560 --> 22:52.500]  goes on people are taking these
[22:52.500 --> 22:55.440]  these photo period cultivars
[22:55.500 --> 22:57.440]  that you know have stood the
[22:57.500 --> 22:59.440]  test of time or are recently
[22:59.520 --> 23:02.440]  being hunted out and and they're
[23:02.520 --> 23:04.440]  they're crossing them to to an
[23:04.520 --> 23:06.460]  auto flower. Essentially what's
[23:06.520 --> 23:08.460]  being happening. What's
[23:08.520 --> 23:10.460]  happening is they're stealing
[23:10.520 --> 23:13.460]  the auto flowering gene. And
[23:13.520 --> 23:16.460]  through breeding work in line
[23:16.520 --> 23:18.460]  work they're taking just that
[23:18.540 --> 23:21.460]  gene and inserting it into this
[23:21.500 --> 23:23.400]  into this photo period cannabis
[23:23.460 --> 23:25.400]  plant so it can retain all those
[23:25.460 --> 23:29.400]  those same a lot of the same
[23:29.460 --> 23:33.400]  traits that the original photo
[23:33.480 --> 23:36.400]  period plant had. So saying that
[23:36.480 --> 23:38.420]  auto flower plant doesn't eat
[23:38.480 --> 23:42.420]  much is you know every cultivar
[23:42.480 --> 23:44.420]  is different just like a photo
[23:44.480 --> 23:46.420]  period. You might have one plant
[23:46.480 --> 23:47.420]  that barely eats anything and
[23:47.480 --> 23:49.420]  you might have one that you just
[23:49.480 --> 23:51.420]  can't keep up with. I mean the
[23:51.480 --> 23:54.420]  same goes for for auto flowers
[23:54.500 --> 23:57.420]  and within cannabis nothing can
[23:57.500 --> 24:00.440]  be generalized into into one
[24:00.500 --> 24:03.440]  category because you know the
[24:03.500 --> 24:07.440]  the the genome itself is so
[24:07.500 --> 24:10.440]  diverse that you know within a
[24:10.500 --> 24:12.440]  line itself you might see all
[24:12.500 --> 24:14.440]  sorts of different nutrient
[24:14.520 --> 24:18.440]  demands. You know you're if an
[24:18.500 --> 24:21.400]  auto flower is fully auto that
[24:21.460 --> 24:22.400]  means it's been worked for at
[24:22.460 --> 24:27.400]  least four generations. That's
[24:27.480 --> 24:28.400]  if it was a photo to auto
[24:28.480 --> 24:31.400]  conversion. So you should have
[24:31.480 --> 24:33.420]  not have a very wide window of
[24:33.480 --> 24:37.420]  phenotypic variation. But there
[24:37.480 --> 24:39.420]  still will be some and some
[24:39.480 --> 24:41.420]  might eat a lot more than others
[24:41.480 --> 24:43.420]  so if that makes sense you can't
[24:43.480 --> 24:46.420]  really generalize any aspect of
[24:46.480 --> 24:48.480]  cannabis photo period or auto
[24:48.540 --> 24:51.480]  flower into you know a single
[24:51.540 --> 24:54.480]  lane of not eating a lot. So I
[24:54.540 --> 24:56.480]  found some cultivars that you
[24:56.560 --> 24:58.480]  know I might have to do you know
[24:58.560 --> 25:00.480]  full strength and then other
[25:00.560 --> 25:03.480]  ones where you know you a
[25:03.560 --> 25:05.500]  quarter strength will do just
[25:05.560 --> 25:08.500]  fine. So that's one of the
[25:08.560 --> 25:10.500]  questions I had for you is when
[25:10.560 --> 25:11.500]  you're building these soil
[25:11.560 --> 25:13.500]  systems and you're running these
[25:13.660 --> 25:16.660]  K and F inputs are you kind of
[25:16.720 --> 25:18.660]  having to figure out and dial in
[25:18.720 --> 25:19.660]  your own systems because they
[25:19.720 --> 25:24.660]  are of an auto ancestry so you
[25:24.740 --> 25:26.660]  got to you know especially
[25:26.740 --> 25:27.660]  outdoors are you kind of
[25:27.740 --> 25:28.660]  configuring things differently
[25:28.740 --> 25:30.660]  are you still just diversity is
[25:30.740 --> 25:31.660]  king just trying to make
[25:31.740 --> 25:34.680]  everything you know as diverse
[25:34.740 --> 25:36.680]  and as healthy as possible.
[25:36.740 --> 25:40.680]  Yeah well so this is that
[25:40.740 --> 25:42.680]  question kind of leads me into a
[25:42.940 --> 25:44.860]  couple of things that I wanted
[25:44.940 --> 25:48.860]  to really iron out here about K
[25:48.940 --> 25:51.860]  and F. There is so or natural
[25:51.940 --> 25:57.860]  farming in general. So let's go
[25:57.940 --> 25:59.860]  ahead and start with like native
[25:59.940 --> 26:03.860]  soils. You know native soils are
[26:03.940 --> 26:06.860]  are packed with with nutrients
[26:06.940 --> 26:08.860]  and minerals oftentimes they're
[26:08.940 --> 26:10.860]  bound up they need to be cycled
[26:11.040 --> 26:12.040]  into a format where the plant
[26:12.100 --> 26:15.040]  can uptake it. And in these
[26:15.100 --> 26:19.040]  cases you see people and K and
[26:19.120 --> 26:22.040]  F always talking about IMO and
[26:22.120 --> 26:24.040]  it's it's a it's really great
[26:24.120 --> 26:26.040]  because you can apply it to
[26:26.120 --> 26:28.060]  those soils almost like you're
[26:28.120 --> 26:30.060]  adding adding compost to get
[26:30.120 --> 26:32.060]  this biology to start cycling
[26:32.120 --> 26:34.060]  these nutrients and in those
[26:34.120 --> 26:36.060]  cases you know you could maybe
[26:36.120 --> 26:38.060]  just plant your auto flower
[26:38.120 --> 26:40.060]  right in the ground and apply
[26:40.060 --> 26:43.260]  some IMO and and the biology
[26:43.340 --> 26:45.280]  will start cycling the stuff
[26:45.340 --> 26:46.280]  that's naturally in the ground
[26:46.340 --> 26:48.280]  and soil. And in that case you
[26:48.340 --> 26:50.280]  know I wouldn't be applying much
[26:50.340 --> 26:53.280]  besides besides just IMO. So
[26:53.340 --> 26:55.280]  that that's that's kind of
[26:55.340 --> 26:58.280]  native soils you know. But most
[26:58.360 --> 27:00.280]  of us that are growing cannabis
[27:00.360 --> 27:03.280]  aren't growing in native soils.
[27:03.360 --> 27:04.800]  You know we're we're we're
[27:04.860 --> 27:07.300]  growing and and pots or we're
[27:07.360 --> 27:09.300]  growing in beds or modified grow
[27:09.600 --> 27:10.600]  medias that we're making
[27:10.680 --> 27:12.600]  ourselves you know maybe buying
[27:12.680 --> 27:14.600]  some bales of pro mix and then
[27:14.680 --> 27:16.620]  adding compost and and planting
[27:16.680 --> 27:19.620]  into that. So and that's most of
[27:19.680 --> 27:21.620]  what I'm doing. I'm I'm using
[27:21.680 --> 27:24.620]  modified grow medias I'm buying
[27:24.680 --> 27:27.620]  for my for my pheno hunts my
[27:27.680 --> 27:29.620]  auto flower pheno hunts. You
[27:29.700 --> 27:32.620]  know I'm buying bales of pro
[27:32.700 --> 27:35.620]  mix or some sunshine mix number
[27:35.700 --> 27:37.640]  four or some kind of soil and
[27:38.040 --> 27:39.980]  then adding adding the compost
[27:40.040 --> 27:42.980]  that I make. And and then at
[27:43.040 --> 27:44.980]  that point you know the it's got
[27:45.040 --> 27:47.980]  some nutrients. It's got some
[27:48.040 --> 27:49.980]  biology but it doesn't have
[27:50.060 --> 27:51.980]  enough to supply the cannabis
[27:52.060 --> 27:54.980]  plant. So this is where you're
[27:55.060 --> 27:58.000]  you can kind of branch off and
[27:58.060 --> 28:00.000]  and diverge into two different
[28:00.060 --> 28:05.000]  paths. I've done both styles but
[28:05.060 --> 28:07.000]  one would be to amend that
[28:07.800 --> 28:11.360]  amend that soil with with dry
[28:11.440 --> 28:13.360]  amendments and provide the
[28:13.440 --> 28:16.380]  nutrients and minerals the plant
[28:16.440 --> 28:20.380]  needs and allow the micro the
[28:20.440 --> 28:22.380]  biology and the compost and the
[28:22.440 --> 28:25.380]  IMO to to break down and cycle
[28:25.440 --> 28:27.380]  those nutrients and allow the
[28:27.440 --> 28:29.380]  plant to choose what it wants to
[28:29.460 --> 28:32.380]  uptake when it needs it and then
[28:32.460 --> 28:36.400]  just use these K and F inputs to
[28:37.360 --> 28:39.760]  maybe correct a deficiency that
[28:39.840 --> 28:43.760]  pops up. So in in that
[28:43.840 --> 28:46.780]  situation you know you're not
[28:46.840 --> 28:49.780]  going to need to be mixing up
[28:49.840 --> 28:51.780]  all these different K and F
[28:51.840 --> 28:54.280]  nutrients at full strength
[28:54.340 --> 28:59.280]  because the plant is is doing
[28:59.360 --> 29:01.280]  choosing its own nutrition when
[29:01.360 --> 29:02.280]  it needs it and you're just
[29:02.360 --> 29:03.280]  keeping an eye on it and
[29:03.360 --> 29:05.280]  noticing something might be
[29:06.240 --> 29:08.180]  deficient and then correcting
[29:08.240 --> 29:10.680]  that deficiency with whatever K
[29:10.740 --> 29:13.040]  and F input you need to use. So
[29:13.120 --> 29:14.940]  that's been one of my favorite
[29:15.020 --> 29:19.060]  styles because it allows well
[29:19.120 --> 29:23.920]  A it's less hands on. Well
[29:24.000 --> 29:25.620]  before I delve into that a
[29:25.700 --> 29:27.000]  little bit more so let me also
[29:27.060 --> 29:29.060]  explain you can also run K and
[29:29.120 --> 29:31.440]  F like it was hydro. You could
[29:31.500 --> 29:34.260]  take you could take some pro
[29:34.320 --> 29:38.060]  mix and put it in the soil with
[29:38.120 --> 29:41.420]  with no compost and and spray
[29:41.480 --> 29:43.360]  some IMO in there to add some
[29:43.420 --> 29:46.960]  biology and then start force
[29:47.020 --> 29:50.400]  feeding your plants these K and
[29:50.460 --> 29:52.900]  F inputs just like it was
[29:52.960 --> 29:56.400]  hydro. You could even take you
[29:56.460 --> 29:58.340]  know mix up your nutrient
[29:58.400 --> 30:03.240]  cocktail and and fertigate a
[30:03.320 --> 30:06.120]  little bit every day just like
[30:06.200 --> 30:07.720]  you would do high frequency
[30:07.800 --> 30:11.040]  for litigation with cocoa or
[30:11.100 --> 30:14.260]  you can you leave it you know
[30:14.340 --> 30:16.440]  your full strength dilution and
[30:16.500 --> 30:19.800]  feed it once a week. You know
[30:19.880 --> 30:24.240]  the problem with this is your
[30:24.300 --> 30:26.120]  it's way more hands on. It's
[30:26.180 --> 30:27.720]  way more involved. You got to
[30:27.780 --> 30:29.820]  mix way more nutrients. You got
[30:29.880 --> 30:32.480]  to be you got to really
[30:32.560 --> 30:35.800]  understand the cannabis
[30:35.860 --> 30:39.240]  nutrition requirements like
[30:39.300 --> 30:42.140]  when does it need when when do
[30:42.200 --> 30:44.440]  you start upping the phosphorus
[30:44.500 --> 30:46.700]  when do you start you know
[30:46.760 --> 30:48.200]  upping the potassium and
[30:48.280 --> 30:49.700]  bringing down the phosphorus
[30:49.780 --> 30:51.040]  like you really need to
[30:51.100 --> 30:53.580]  understand when the plant needs
[30:53.640 --> 30:54.800]  all of its nutritional
[30:54.880 --> 30:56.960]  requirements and give it to
[30:57.020 --> 30:59.320]  them at that phase right at
[30:59.380 --> 31:01.060]  that point because unlike
[31:01.140 --> 31:03.820]  hydro where bottle nutrients
[31:03.880 --> 31:05.080]  where you might have an A and
[31:05.140 --> 31:07.440]  a B that has all of those
[31:07.500 --> 31:09.100]  nutrients like mixed at the
[31:09.160 --> 31:12.280]  perfect intervals we have
[31:12.340 --> 31:14.220]  individual nutrients for
[31:14.280 --> 31:15.340]  everything. So we have a
[31:15.420 --> 31:17.460]  nitrogen input a phosphorus
[31:17.520 --> 31:19.660]  input a potassium input a
[31:19.720 --> 31:21.620]  calcium input and you need to
[31:21.680 --> 31:23.100]  know when and how to apply
[31:23.160 --> 31:24.540]  these. So that ends up
[31:24.600 --> 31:26.620]  becoming a lot harder. You
[31:27.100 --> 31:32.000]  really have to understand and
[31:32.060 --> 31:33.800]  know when to apply them. But
[31:33.860 --> 31:35.260]  I've found that this has been
[31:35.320 --> 31:37.500]  really helpful for me
[31:37.560 --> 31:40.660]  oftentimes when I'm doing
[31:40.740 --> 31:42.660]  pheno hunts and running I
[31:42.740 --> 31:44.480]  need to cram as many plants
[31:44.540 --> 31:45.940]  into a small space and I'm
[31:46.000 --> 31:48.540]  running small pots where the
[31:48.600 --> 31:51.120]  plants are just going to suck
[31:51.180 --> 31:52.580]  up the nutrition in the pots
[31:52.640 --> 31:55.420]  in no time. Well now I can
[31:55.480 --> 31:58.020]  almost run a hydro style K and
[31:58.080 --> 32:00.980]  F system to keep these half
[32:01.060 --> 32:03.520]  gallon pots fed and keep them
[32:03.600 --> 32:07.820]  happy. But like I was saying
[32:07.900 --> 32:10.600]  that takes a lot of work a lot
[32:10.660 --> 32:12.060]  of time when you're dealing
[32:12.140 --> 32:14.800]  with lots of plants it can be
[32:14.860 --> 32:18.900]  very very time consuming. So
[32:18.980 --> 32:20.480]  I found this really nice in
[32:20.540 --> 32:24.840]  between of you know amending
[32:24.860 --> 32:26.300]  the soils and kind of just
[32:26.360 --> 32:29.140]  water only and then with the
[32:29.200 --> 32:32.480]  occasional you know K and F
[32:32.540 --> 32:34.840]  cocktail sprays of whatever it
[32:34.900 --> 32:37.820]  might need to to keep it happy.
[32:37.880 --> 32:39.420]  So I've just kind of chunked
[32:39.480 --> 32:40.880]  this up into three different
[32:40.940 --> 32:42.180]  things. We've got our native
[32:42.240 --> 32:44.360]  soils. We've got soils that
[32:44.420 --> 32:45.880]  we're building that have
[32:45.960 --> 32:47.480]  nutrition or we're adding
[32:47.560 --> 32:50.560]  nutrition or running these
[32:50.620 --> 32:53.620]  this style like hydro. So you
[32:53.680 --> 32:55.940]  can really take it a lot of
[32:56.020 --> 32:58.040]  different ways depending on
[32:58.120 --> 32:59.320]  what kind of growth style
[32:59.380 --> 33:01.520]  you're you're you're kind of
[33:01.580 --> 33:04.780]  into or or what fits best with
[33:04.860 --> 33:06.060]  with your life or what you're
[33:06.120 --> 33:11.700]  trying to do. Makes a lot of
[33:11.760 --> 33:13.640]  sense. That's a very cool way
[33:13.700 --> 33:16.340]  of presenting other potential
[33:16.400 --> 33:19.240]  ways of using natural farming.
[33:19.300 --> 33:20.100]  I've never heard of anybody
[33:20.180 --> 33:23.640]  using it. This is a nice little
[33:23.700 --> 33:25.860]  segue for a question from our
[33:25.920 --> 33:27.900]  audience that asked not to be
[33:27.960 --> 33:30.000]  outed for it. The individual is
[33:30.060 --> 33:32.160]  having trouble learning how to
[33:32.240 --> 33:34.240]  grow and learn how to make
[33:34.300 --> 33:36.080]  nutrients and know when to add
[33:36.140 --> 33:37.440]  like you were saying you know
[33:37.500 --> 33:39.240]  especially with more of the
[33:39.300 --> 33:41.340]  more in depth K and F styles.
[33:41.400 --> 33:42.280]  You know not only are you
[33:42.340 --> 33:43.320]  making the ferments you don't
[33:43.380 --> 33:45.020]  really know when they're added.
[33:45.080 --> 33:46.120]  So this individual wanted to
[33:46.180 --> 33:48.480]  know like is it OK for me to
[33:48.560 --> 33:50.020]  maybe purchase purchase
[33:50.080 --> 33:52.020]  products. You know obviously I
[33:52.080 --> 33:53.320]  answered this in a certain way
[33:53.560 --> 33:54.500]  but I wanted to kind of let you
[33:54.560 --> 33:56.100]  guys kind of give that off and
[33:56.180 --> 33:58.200]  then the caveat to that was they
[33:58.280 --> 33:59.340]  they also felt like they might
[33:59.400 --> 34:00.800]  need to start off with autos
[34:00.880 --> 34:02.840]  they're having trouble you know
[34:02.900 --> 34:05.940]  growing the regulars.
[34:06.020 --> 34:07.320]  Autos are harder to grow than
[34:07.380 --> 34:10.420]  photos 100 percent. Autos
[34:10.480 --> 34:12.120]  there's a very little room for
[34:12.180 --> 34:14.980]  air. You know there's a reason
[34:15.060 --> 34:16.860]  why everyone recommends to plan
[34:16.920 --> 34:18.600]  them in the final container.
[34:18.660 --> 34:20.120]  It's because your window for
[34:20.160 --> 34:23.100]  transplant is so narrow.
[34:23.160 --> 34:25.200]  If you transplant too early you
[34:25.260 --> 34:26.300]  damage the roots.
[34:26.360 --> 34:28.040]  If you transplant too late you
[34:28.100 --> 34:30.200]  let the roots get root bound and
[34:30.280 --> 34:32.040]  you literally just stunted your
[34:32.100 --> 34:33.540]  plant like every day you're
[34:33.600 --> 34:36.980]  taking huge chunks off your
[34:37.040 --> 34:37.920]  final yield.
[34:37.980 --> 34:39.420]  If you don't if you don't
[34:39.480 --> 34:41.620]  transplant it property properly
[34:41.680 --> 34:43.720]  but also unfortunately like
[34:43.780 --> 34:45.380]  there's a reason why
[34:45.460 --> 34:48.420]  transplanting is ubiquitous in
[34:48.460 --> 34:50.620]  horticulture because allowing
[34:50.700 --> 34:55.000]  the roots to to fill a space
[34:55.060 --> 34:57.860]  before transplanting into a
[34:57.940 --> 35:00.740]  bigger spot is a more efficient
[35:00.800 --> 35:03.100]  way to allow the roots to grow.
[35:03.180 --> 35:05.340]  So what I'm getting at is I
[35:05.400 --> 35:07.340]  would not start with autos if
[35:07.400 --> 35:08.940]  you're just learning.
[35:09.020 --> 35:10.520]  I know a lot of the young folks
[35:10.580 --> 35:14.080]  these days love the idea of not
[35:14.140 --> 35:17.380]  having to switch the lights but
[35:17.440 --> 35:20.080]  I say get yourself a timer and
[35:20.160 --> 35:23.320]  learn how to grow with with
[35:23.380 --> 35:24.880]  with photo periods because they
[35:24.960 --> 35:27.160]  are way more forgiving.
[35:27.220 --> 35:28.520]  If you mess something up in
[35:28.600 --> 35:30.760]  bed well spend an extra two
[35:30.820 --> 35:33.100]  weeks nursing that plant back
[35:33.160 --> 35:34.600]  and then flip the lights and
[35:34.660 --> 35:35.860]  boom you're off.
[35:35.940 --> 35:37.900]  If you know if you're trying to
[35:37.960 --> 35:40.040]  learn off autos like and you're
[35:40.100 --> 35:41.880]  only growing two autos at a
[35:41.940 --> 35:44.200]  time like you know it could be
[35:44.280 --> 35:46.100]  you you could have a bunch of
[35:46.200 --> 35:51.740]  unsuccessful grows and never
[35:51.800 --> 35:53.840]  really I'm just trying to get
[35:53.900 --> 35:55.680]  the point across like get to
[35:55.740 --> 35:57.300]  understand the cannabis plant
[35:57.380 --> 35:59.140]  and how it grows and how to
[35:59.220 --> 36:01.020]  transplant and how to how to
[36:01.080 --> 36:02.980]  just take care of these plants
[36:03.040 --> 36:04.340]  before you really start going
[36:04.420 --> 36:06.320]  into the auto world.
[36:06.380 --> 36:08.460]  And that's kind of my feeling on
[36:08.520 --> 36:10.260]  that.
[36:10.320 --> 36:12.300]  Is there any truth to the tap
[36:12.360 --> 36:14.720]  root triggering the flowering
[36:14.800 --> 36:15.660]  period.
[36:15.780 --> 36:18.020]  Can you talk.
[36:18.100 --> 36:19.060]  Absolutely.
[36:19.120 --> 36:19.420]  Yeah.
[36:19.500 --> 36:22.620]  That's one of the things.
[36:22.700 --> 36:22.900]  Yeah.
[36:22.960 --> 36:24.800]  Once that once that root
[36:24.860 --> 36:26.100]  systems like started to get
[36:26.160 --> 36:28.060]  bound and I don't know if it's
[36:28.140 --> 36:32.400]  a if it's the tap root or or
[36:32.480 --> 36:34.140]  the ancillary roots.
[36:34.200 --> 36:35.840]  I'm not sure which part but it
[36:35.900 --> 36:38.480]  absolutely is true that if that
[36:38.540 --> 36:40.020]  thing is left root bound for a
[36:40.080 --> 36:42.080]  few too many days like boom all
[36:42.140 --> 36:43.280]  of a sudden you'll start have
[36:43.340 --> 36:45.320]  pre flowers pop up.
[36:45.340 --> 36:47.520]  So whereas if you had done a
[36:47.580 --> 36:50.680]  perfect transplant you you know
[36:50.740 --> 36:51.960]  your two week transplant or
[36:52.020 --> 36:53.660]  whatever you might get an extra
[36:53.720 --> 36:56.080]  two weeks of insane veg growth
[36:56.160 --> 36:59.260]  before it starts to flower.
[36:59.320 --> 37:00.760]  And that two weeks of veg
[37:00.820 --> 37:02.960]  growth I mean is like
[37:03.020 --> 37:05.700]  exponential will exponentially
[37:05.760 --> 37:09.960]  increase your yield at the end.
[37:10.040 --> 37:12.340]  At the same time I try to
[37:12.400 --> 37:14.940]  whenever I'm doing any breeding
[37:15.120 --> 37:17.300]  transplant every single auto
[37:17.360 --> 37:18.900]  and I try to be rough as shit I
[37:18.960 --> 37:20.340]  try to leave them root bound.
[37:20.400 --> 37:22.340]  I try to be you know the good
[37:22.400 --> 37:24.400]  old school nursery transplant
[37:24.460 --> 37:26.480]  rip it out rip up the roots you
[37:26.540 --> 37:27.480]  know hit it with some
[37:27.540 --> 37:29.300]  mycorrhizae boom and the new
[37:29.380 --> 37:34.220]  pot because I think this is a
[37:34.280 --> 37:37.380]  you know it's a trait that can
[37:37.440 --> 37:39.960]  be bred out with time with
[37:40.020 --> 37:41.520]  proper selection if every
[37:41.580 --> 37:44.520]  breeder was doing that and then
[37:45.040 --> 37:47.000]  tossing the runts the stuff that
[37:47.080 --> 37:50.500]  got stunted and only was
[37:50.580 --> 37:52.840]  working with you know the things
[37:52.920 --> 37:54.240]  that really handled that
[37:54.320 --> 37:57.120]  transplant well like then
[37:57.780 --> 38:00.880]  within within I don't know how
[38:00.960 --> 38:02.280]  long but it wouldn't take too
[38:02.360 --> 38:04.320]  long before that trait was
[38:04.800 --> 38:07.700]  wiped out of the lines that of
[38:07.760 --> 38:09.460]  whatever breeder was working on
[38:09.520 --> 38:11.320]  that.
[38:11.400 --> 38:12.440]  I don't think I might have got
[38:12.440 --> 38:14.020]  to stop the question there but.
[38:15.520 --> 38:16.320]  I apologize.
[38:16.380 --> 38:17.660]  That's all right no I just is
[38:17.720 --> 38:19.820]  Rancid you do yes you're with
[38:19.880 --> 38:20.920]  the king of the castle with
[38:21.000 --> 38:22.220]  those the Layton's allowed you
[38:22.300 --> 38:23.720]  know he passes them out like
[38:23.800 --> 38:24.760]  really walking tickets.
[38:26.460 --> 38:27.640]  No but that was that was an
[38:27.700 --> 38:29.000]  important piece of information
[38:29.060 --> 38:29.800]  right there I mean.
[38:31.840 --> 38:34.340]  On non cannabis related project
[38:34.400 --> 38:36.680]  I'm working on here we did two
[38:36.740 --> 38:38.400]  different ways one was to do
[38:38.480 --> 38:40.480]  traditional nursery men beat the
[38:40.540 --> 38:42.040]  friggin shit out of the roots
[38:42.380 --> 38:43.480]  basically bear root.
[38:44.440 --> 38:45.980]  Before they and the others we
[38:46.040 --> 38:48.660]  put in in the in the plant in
[38:48.720 --> 38:51.020]  the pot or in the same material
[38:51.080 --> 38:52.160]  that was in the pot not
[38:52.220 --> 38:54.000]  disturbing roots and actually
[38:54.060 --> 38:55.120]  the bear roots were a little
[38:55.200 --> 38:57.160]  bit more tricky to get to take
[38:57.600 --> 38:59.320]  but once they took man they
[38:59.400 --> 39:00.800]  kicked the ass of the ones that
[39:00.860 --> 39:02.000]  were remaining in the container
[39:02.060 --> 39:04.600]  so that's that's a great bit of
[39:04.660 --> 39:05.320]  information right.
[39:08.620 --> 39:10.860]  Now do you do you mind sharing
[39:10.920 --> 39:12.420]  some of the breeders that you're
[39:12.480 --> 39:14.720]  working with because I you would
[39:14.800 --> 39:15.800]  be surprised with how many
[39:15.860 --> 39:17.300]  people you know they're Hey I
[39:17.360 --> 39:18.440]  got like a couple hundred
[39:18.500 --> 39:19.760]  dollars and I don't want to.
[39:21.160 --> 39:22.060]  And I see where they're coming
[39:22.140 --> 39:23.740]  from like it kind of is a
[39:23.800 --> 39:24.940]  lottery ticket especially if
[39:25.000 --> 39:26.640]  you're whole new to the entire
[39:26.700 --> 39:27.940]  seed game and you don't really
[39:28.000 --> 39:30.000]  know outside of like Instagram
[39:30.080 --> 39:32.640]  hype are there certain breeders
[39:32.720 --> 39:33.720]  or certain people you want to
[39:33.780 --> 39:34.840]  kind of give a shout out to we
[39:34.920 --> 39:36.080]  like to get also give shout outs
[39:36.140 --> 39:37.640]  to maybe somebody that's not
[39:37.720 --> 39:38.980]  necessarily known that's still
[39:39.060 --> 39:39.920]  putting in the good work.
[39:40.880 --> 39:41.380]  Yeah.
[39:42.480 --> 39:42.980]  Yeah.
[39:43.060 --> 39:43.560]  What I'm.
[39:44.660 --> 39:45.620]  What anyone.
[39:47.060 --> 39:50.000]  Anyone that I really recommend is
[39:50.060 --> 39:52.160]  someone that is is running
[39:52.240 --> 39:55.760]  numbers breeding is a numbers
[39:55.840 --> 39:56.340]  game.
[39:57.000 --> 39:59.540]  If you got a four by four tent
[39:59.600 --> 40:03.080]  and you're just you know run in
[40:03.240 --> 40:07.180]  a pack it's not enough to really
[40:07.200 --> 40:10.180]  find those winners and breed
[40:10.240 --> 40:10.740]  with them.
[40:11.440 --> 40:12.940]  My favorite breeder that I feel
[40:13.020 --> 40:14.080]  like is do it might be our
[40:14.140 --> 40:16.620]  auto flower breeder that I feel
[40:16.680 --> 40:18.280]  like is really doing the good
[40:18.360 --> 40:22.020]  work is Daz with night owl.
[40:23.180 --> 40:25.260]  He's got a facility I'm sure
[40:25.320 --> 40:26.860]  when he's doing this vino hunts
[40:26.920 --> 40:29.000]  he's doing a hundred plus seats
[40:29.600 --> 40:34.000]  he's he's getting his hands on
[40:34.060 --> 40:37.560]  these these elite photo period
[40:37.620 --> 40:40.600]  genetics and then using his
[40:40.660 --> 40:43.200]  stable of well built lines that
[40:43.260 --> 40:46.300]  he's made over the years to
[40:46.360 --> 40:49.080]  start these conversions and
[40:49.140 --> 40:50.600]  working them over four
[40:50.680 --> 40:55.080]  generations testing them and
[40:55.140 --> 40:56.120]  then releasing them.
[40:56.540 --> 40:58.580]  So not only are you getting
[40:58.640 --> 41:01.780]  these you know these nice worked
[41:02.040 --> 41:06.280]  inbred lines that were selected
[41:06.340 --> 41:10.440]  by running numbers and he's also
[41:10.500 --> 41:12.320]  starting to take these auto
[41:12.380 --> 41:14.480]  flower lines that he you know
[41:14.540 --> 41:18.280]  has made made through through
[41:18.580 --> 41:20.380]  line breeding and then out
[41:20.460 --> 41:23.120]  crossing them to other lines
[41:23.180 --> 41:25.220]  that he's made in creating you
[41:25.300 --> 41:28.620]  know F1 hybrids and and I've
[41:28.640 --> 41:32.180]  found amazing success with with
[41:32.240 --> 41:33.740]  all of his stuff I mean I've
[41:33.800 --> 41:36.480]  seen people think autos don't
[41:36.540 --> 41:38.440]  intersect I've seen intersects
[41:38.520 --> 41:40.440]  traits with with all cannabis
[41:40.520 --> 41:45.120]  plants and and his doesn't have
[41:46.380 --> 41:48.660]  more than anyone but if you're
[41:48.720 --> 41:51.160]  growing them right it's not hard
[41:51.220 --> 41:53.760]  to get you know chin high auto
[41:53.820 --> 41:58.040]  flowers that stack you know that
[41:58.160 --> 42:00.800]  that you know that have
[42:00.960 --> 42:03.800]  satellite branch in and in stack
[42:03.860 --> 42:07.560]  colas so he's I really
[42:07.620 --> 42:09.220]  appreciate what he's got going
[42:09.280 --> 42:13.700]  on over there besides that he's
[42:14.200 --> 42:16.740]  he's kind of a marketing genius
[42:16.800 --> 42:18.600]  and if you hop on one of his
[42:18.660 --> 42:20.180]  drops and buy something he'll
[42:20.240 --> 42:21.440]  send you all sorts of little
[42:21.500 --> 42:23.680]  goodies I mean I've gotten
[42:24.360 --> 42:26.220]  Christmas cards from him with
[42:26.220 --> 42:30.720]  packs of seeds you know so he's
[42:30.780 --> 42:34.060]  he's doing the good work as to
[42:35.140 --> 42:37.020]  I had really good luck with
[42:37.940 --> 42:40.300]  Viking gardens that's real for
[42:40.360 --> 42:43.780]  eighty nine he has he's over
[42:43.840 --> 42:45.260]  there doing stuff in deep water
[42:45.320 --> 42:47.700]  culture and I got one of his
[42:48.020 --> 42:50.100]  flagship strains the Thor's
[42:50.160 --> 42:52.740]  hammer F4 and I probably ran out
[42:52.800 --> 42:54.940]  thirty five of them and every
[42:55.020 --> 42:58.140]  single one of them was chin high
[42:58.740 --> 43:04.500]  greasy tricone laden dripping
[43:06.060 --> 43:08.100]  grape candy turps like that
[43:08.160 --> 43:10.780]  really blew me away at that
[43:10.840 --> 43:14.460]  point like I hadn't really heard
[43:14.520 --> 43:16.180]  too much about him and I tried
[43:16.240 --> 43:17.420]  out his stuff I was super
[43:17.480 --> 43:20.340]  skeptical and I was very very
[43:20.400 --> 43:23.220]  happy with with how all those
[43:23.220 --> 43:25.500]  plants turned out so he went up
[43:25.560 --> 43:29.420]  in my book big time I'm still
[43:29.480 --> 43:32.100]  trying to navigate those waters
[43:32.160 --> 43:33.660]  and kind of really figure out
[43:33.980 --> 43:37.900]  who else is is doing the good
[43:37.960 --> 43:41.700]  work I know eat those has
[43:41.760 --> 43:45.340]  facilities and and he he's
[43:45.420 --> 43:47.500]  recently stepped into breeding
[43:47.560 --> 43:49.780]  auto flowers so I bet he's
[43:49.820 --> 43:52.820]  running numbers I know twenty
[43:52.880 --> 43:56.700]  twenty men to see now you know
[43:56.760 --> 43:58.740]  they do good breeding work and
[43:58.800 --> 44:00.540]  they're in the auto flower game
[44:00.700 --> 44:02.300]  I have not tried either of those
[44:02.360 --> 44:04.580]  guys but back to the matter is
[44:04.900 --> 44:07.140]  if you're running numbers you
[44:07.200 --> 44:09.260]  will be able to find those
[44:09.320 --> 44:11.620]  standout plants and then work
[44:11.680 --> 44:15.220]  with them let's see who else
[44:16.260 --> 44:19.580]  humble see Nat Nat and Haley
[44:19.580 --> 44:21.300]  over a humble seed company
[44:21.740 --> 44:23.340]  they're also they got a big
[44:23.400 --> 44:25.940]  facility large license there
[44:26.580 --> 44:27.980]  they're doing some auto flower
[44:28.040 --> 44:30.060]  breeding I bet people would have
[44:30.140 --> 44:33.420]  good luck with them as well but
[44:33.480 --> 44:34.740]  the crazy thing is when you're
[44:34.800 --> 44:36.580]  breeding auto flowers say you
[44:36.660 --> 44:38.260]  you pop a hundred you pop a
[44:38.320 --> 44:40.140]  hundred seeds while fifty of
[44:40.200 --> 44:41.780]  those are going to be male so
[44:41.840 --> 44:43.020]  you got to pull them to the side
[44:43.260 --> 44:44.980]  you can't clone these first off
[44:45.040 --> 44:46.820]  so you got a real you got to
[44:47.260 --> 44:49.180]  have your eye on which male you
[44:49.180 --> 44:50.540]  think is going to be your winner
[44:50.600 --> 44:51.860]  right from the gate and there's
[44:51.920 --> 44:54.220]  no like cloning it and trying it
[44:54.280 --> 44:56.060]  out and was it a good male like
[44:56.460 --> 44:58.020]  you pick your male and then the
[44:58.080 --> 45:00.060]  only way to do it is to pollinate
[45:00.580 --> 45:01.980]  the whole crop.
[45:05.020 --> 45:05.620]  Hold on one sec.
[45:06.580 --> 45:08.660]  Pollinate the whole crop and
[45:08.720 --> 45:12.380]  then at the end you got to you
[45:12.440 --> 45:13.220]  pick your winner.
[45:13.420 --> 45:15.180]  It's like OK this Fino this
[45:15.240 --> 45:15.980]  Fino is the winner.
[45:16.040 --> 45:17.100]  Look at that structure.
[45:17.160 --> 45:18.220]  Look at that branching.
[45:18.280 --> 45:19.100]  Look at that yield.
[45:19.160 --> 45:19.980]  Look at those turfs.
[45:19.980 --> 45:21.260]  Look at the trichome coverage
[45:21.580 --> 45:22.180]  whatever.
[45:24.420 --> 45:25.900]  So you keep your seeds from that
[45:25.960 --> 45:28.180]  winter plant though the rest of
[45:28.240 --> 45:31.460]  your crop is essentially a lost
[45:31.520 --> 45:31.860]  crop.
[45:31.920 --> 45:33.860]  I mean you can you extract it or
[45:33.920 --> 45:35.260]  whatever but now you've got this
[45:35.320 --> 45:38.100]  whole seeded crop that you can't
[45:38.160 --> 45:41.780]  use because you know you
[45:41.840 --> 45:42.700]  couldn't clone it.
[45:43.580 --> 45:45.620]  So that's that's the one that's
[45:45.680 --> 45:48.300]  the hard part about auto flowers
[45:48.380 --> 45:51.540]  and anyone who's who's really
[45:52.620 --> 45:53.940]  breeding auto flowers is
[45:54.000 --> 45:56.940]  sacrificing their their grows to
[45:57.340 --> 45:58.700]  to get these seeds.
[45:59.220 --> 46:01.980]  So respect anyone that's that's
[46:02.040 --> 46:05.260]  out there breeding auto flowers.
[46:07.860 --> 46:09.500]  You see that brother is that a
[46:09.560 --> 46:10.940]  good point that he's making
[46:11.000 --> 46:11.300]  there.
[46:13.260 --> 46:14.380]  I was going to ask the same
[46:14.440 --> 46:14.660]  thing.
[46:14.720 --> 46:15.940]  What about saving pollen.
[46:16.000 --> 46:17.260]  But I know that's a whole nother
[46:17.320 --> 46:18.260]  game in itself.
[46:18.340 --> 46:21.140]  Is is properly handling and
[46:21.200 --> 46:21.700]  storing it.
[46:23.340 --> 46:24.100]  Have you done any work.
[46:25.820 --> 46:26.700]  Oh all the time.
[46:26.760 --> 46:27.820]  Yeah absolutely.
[46:28.460 --> 46:29.020]  No I.
[46:29.140 --> 46:30.780]  You can isolate your males
[46:30.840 --> 46:32.460]  anywhere you know stick them in
[46:32.520 --> 46:34.660]  your wife's closet put them in a
[46:34.720 --> 46:36.900]  new tent go kill carry them to
[46:36.960 --> 46:38.340]  the other side of your property.
[46:38.740 --> 46:39.460]  Did you hear that.
[46:42.220 --> 46:43.500]  Yes I did.
[46:44.180 --> 46:45.860]  She's sitting beside me so I got
[46:45.920 --> 46:46.660]  to be where.
[46:49.100 --> 46:51.660]  The big thing is isolating those
[46:51.720 --> 46:53.660]  males getting them away from
[46:53.720 --> 46:56.060]  your your pollen recipients
[46:56.120 --> 46:58.580]  because that pollen will fly.
[46:59.180 --> 47:02.780]  And and it you know so it's good
[47:02.840 --> 47:05.900]  to isolate those as to pollen
[47:05.960 --> 47:06.540]  collection.
[47:06.600 --> 47:07.620]  Yeah I've tried a bunch of
[47:07.680 --> 47:08.580]  different methods.
[47:09.220 --> 47:11.580]  I like the good all all separate
[47:11.640 --> 47:13.420]  males grow them out once they're
[47:13.480 --> 47:14.660]  starting to get big they're
[47:14.720 --> 47:17.560]  starting to you know drop pollen
[47:17.600 --> 47:18.560]  all over the place.
[47:18.620 --> 47:20.400]  I'll go ahead and and clip the
[47:20.680 --> 47:22.800]  clip the clip it like a flower
[47:22.860 --> 47:23.520]  bouquet.
[47:25.160 --> 47:27.600]  Get you know a court jar.
[47:29.120 --> 47:31.560]  Court Mason jar drill a hole in
[47:31.620 --> 47:33.320]  it that's just big enough for
[47:33.380 --> 47:34.000]  the stem.
[47:34.280 --> 47:35.560]  Fill it up with water.
[47:36.600 --> 47:38.520]  Stick that stem in there and
[47:38.580 --> 47:39.880]  it's it's essentially like a
[47:39.940 --> 47:41.600]  flower bouquet at that point you
[47:41.660 --> 47:42.880]  know you're just providing this
[47:42.940 --> 47:46.560]  water source and and put down
[47:46.560 --> 47:49.200]  some tinfoil and set your jar on
[47:49.260 --> 47:52.280]  top of it and those pollen sacks
[47:52.340 --> 47:53.960]  over the coming week or two
[47:54.020 --> 47:56.040]  weeks will all open and they'll
[47:56.100 --> 47:58.160]  just drop their pollen right on
[47:58.220 --> 47:59.920]  to the tinfoil.
[48:00.800 --> 48:04.560]  At that point you you strain out
[48:04.620 --> 48:06.480]  all the plant matter all the
[48:06.540 --> 48:07.360]  plant material.
[48:07.440 --> 48:09.440]  There's anything left in there
[48:09.560 --> 48:11.800]  that plant material will let off
[48:11.860 --> 48:13.840]  moisture and it will kill your
[48:13.900 --> 48:14.400]  pollen.
[48:14.720 --> 48:17.720]  So you got to you know strain it
[48:17.780 --> 48:20.480]  through a fine micron screen like
[48:20.560 --> 48:22.880]  80 90 micron or something.
[48:23.640 --> 48:25.280]  I don't even know what micron my
[48:25.340 --> 48:26.400]  screen is but that should
[48:26.460 --> 48:27.120]  probably work.
[48:27.200 --> 48:28.960]  Get all that plant material out
[48:30.440 --> 48:33.480]  and at this point you know put it
[48:33.540 --> 48:36.120]  in a some kind of container or
[48:36.180 --> 48:38.120]  the little centrifuge tubes that
[48:38.520 --> 48:42.160]  that everyone put seeds in store
[48:42.160 --> 48:43.880]  with desiccant packs in the
[48:43.940 --> 48:44.480]  fridge.
[48:46.280 --> 48:48.120]  I've also had pretty decent
[48:50.560 --> 48:51.960]  success with our.
[48:54.560 --> 48:55.280]  Is everyone's.
[48:55.400 --> 48:57.160]  Did I lose everyone or we still
[48:57.220 --> 48:57.720]  go.
[48:57.800 --> 48:59.120]  You froze up there so just
[48:59.180 --> 49:00.400]  repeat that last sentence.
[49:01.040 --> 49:01.540]  OK.
[49:01.600 --> 49:02.100]  Yeah.
[49:02.160 --> 49:04.000]  So I've also had pretty good
[49:04.060 --> 49:05.600]  success with taking the pollen
[49:05.660 --> 49:06.820]  and mixing it with a little bit
[49:06.880 --> 49:07.600]  of flower.
[49:08.560 --> 49:11.080]  That flower seems to kind of be
[49:11.160 --> 49:13.400]  almost a desiccant in itself.
[49:14.760 --> 49:16.960]  But fact of the matter is you
[49:17.020 --> 49:18.360]  know you're going to be really
[49:18.420 --> 49:20.000]  starting to lose viability of
[49:20.060 --> 49:22.000]  pollen after you know.
[49:23.800 --> 49:26.240]  Three months maybe max.
[49:26.680 --> 49:28.040]  It's starting to get iffy if
[49:28.100 --> 49:30.320]  you're trying to you know bank
[49:30.380 --> 49:32.680]  on this pollen for this project
[49:32.740 --> 49:33.760]  you know it's getting real
[49:33.820 --> 49:35.480]  sketchy after three months.
[49:37.840 --> 49:39.600]  So well there's some information
[49:39.660 --> 49:40.440]  for you out there.
[49:42.080 --> 49:43.360]  Great gold bar there.
[49:47.360 --> 49:48.800]  There was a question from
[49:48.860 --> 49:49.480]  Greens.
[49:49.840 --> 49:51.240]  So let's just let's go ahead and
[49:51.300 --> 49:52.480]  throw that out there for you.
[49:53.080 --> 49:54.440]  She's struggling to get them to
[49:54.500 --> 49:56.920]  finish properly and maybe you
[49:56.980 --> 49:58.480]  could give her some suggestions.
[49:58.560 --> 49:59.320]  Hey Greens what's up.
[50:04.080 --> 50:04.960]  Oh man.
[50:06.240 --> 50:07.160]  Let's see.
[50:07.840 --> 50:10.800]  I maybe bump up your FFJ
[50:10.960 --> 50:11.280]  right.
[50:11.360 --> 50:13.840]  The FFJ fermented fruit juice
[50:14.800 --> 50:18.080]  if you know harvested
[50:18.400 --> 50:20.160]  from which it's kind of a hard
[50:20.220 --> 50:21.600]  time because we're still early
[50:21.660 --> 50:23.040]  in the season so a lot of stuff
[50:23.100 --> 50:24.520]  is not fruiting right now.
[50:25.360 --> 50:27.880]  But yeah a lot of the hormones
[50:27.940 --> 50:30.760]  and stuff that is that ends up
[50:30.820 --> 50:33.320]  getting locked in within that
[50:33.480 --> 50:37.480]  that fermentation process will
[50:37.920 --> 50:40.440]  will help trigger that plant to
[50:40.480 --> 50:42.200]  ripen up and finish.
[50:42.800 --> 50:45.080]  So I would recommend fermented
[50:45.140 --> 50:49.440]  fruit juice and you know may
[50:49.500 --> 50:52.040]  bump up your potassium bump up
[50:52.100 --> 50:53.720]  your water soluble potassium
[50:54.360 --> 50:57.880]  and help those buds thicken up.
[50:57.960 --> 51:00.880]  But but really the the the
[51:00.940 --> 51:02.040]  fruiting hormones that are
[51:02.100 --> 51:03.960]  locked within the FFJ should
[51:04.440 --> 51:07.800]  should help you know kind of
[51:07.860 --> 51:10.360]  get that that ripening and the
[51:10.360 --> 51:12.000]  finishing effect going.
[51:13.360 --> 51:15.240]  Do you think in this case kelp
[51:15.320 --> 51:17.240]  which is another hormone not
[51:17.300 --> 51:18.760]  necessarily a fruiting hormone
[51:19.360 --> 51:20.640]  but definitely a plant hormone
[51:20.700 --> 51:22.440]  would help in her case as well.
[51:25.240 --> 51:26.240]  Kelp is great.
[51:27.360 --> 51:30.080]  You know who knows maybe she's
[51:30.360 --> 51:32.720]  experiencing some kind of trace
[51:32.780 --> 51:34.640]  mineral deficiency that's not
[51:34.700 --> 51:36.920]  allowing the plant to you know
[51:36.980 --> 51:39.360]  go ahead and and and crank as
[51:39.360 --> 51:40.520]  fast as it should.
[51:41.000 --> 51:45.400]  And and I find that I love kelp
[51:45.480 --> 51:46.760]  fermented plant juice.
[51:46.840 --> 51:49.240]  I'll just ferment kelp harvest
[51:49.300 --> 51:50.720]  it right off the beach and
[51:50.800 --> 51:51.520]  ferment it.
[51:51.960 --> 51:54.400]  And I find that it's really
[51:54.460 --> 51:57.760]  great for correcting correcting
[51:57.820 --> 52:00.880]  deficiencies trace mineral
[52:00.940 --> 52:01.840]  deficiencies.
[52:02.200 --> 52:04.240]  Another thing that she could try
[52:04.300 --> 52:05.360]  is seawater.
[52:06.000 --> 52:07.560]  Generally we're bumping up our
[52:07.600 --> 52:10.320]  seawater and the once we get into
[52:10.400 --> 52:12.880]  flowering and seawater is
[52:12.940 --> 52:15.520]  actually chock full of basically
[52:15.600 --> 52:17.680]  every nutrient mineral and
[52:17.740 --> 52:19.400]  element that's on the planet and
[52:19.460 --> 52:20.880]  small trace amounts.
[52:21.240 --> 52:23.520]  And for the for the most part
[52:23.580 --> 52:26.560]  like this seawater we use in
[52:26.620 --> 52:28.080]  flower it's a half cup per
[52:28.140 --> 52:28.640]  gallon.
[52:31.840 --> 52:34.520]  But you know like it's not going
[52:34.580 --> 52:36.320]  to have a negligible amount of
[52:36.360 --> 52:38.280]  nitrogen and phosphorus potassium
[52:38.340 --> 52:41.200]  calcium sulfur like all the main
[52:41.260 --> 52:42.480]  stuff that the plant uses
[52:43.880 --> 52:46.800]  magnesium you know but the stuff
[52:46.860 --> 52:49.600]  that is is really trace that the
[52:49.660 --> 52:51.800]  plant only uses a tiny bit of
[52:51.860 --> 52:53.600]  like you know maybe like iron
[52:53.660 --> 52:56.520]  copper zinc or on molybdenum
[52:56.580 --> 52:57.560]  stuff like that.
[52:58.760 --> 52:59.680]  If you're experiencing
[52:59.740 --> 53:01.760]  deficiency with that oftentimes
[53:01.760 --> 53:06.320]  a kelp FPGA or or or just a
[53:06.380 --> 53:09.360]  seawater foliar or root drench
[53:10.400 --> 53:12.560]  you know will help correct those
[53:12.620 --> 53:14.300]  deficiencies and allow that plant
[53:14.360 --> 53:15.960]  to pull out of you know whatever
[53:16.020 --> 53:17.400]  it's currently experiencing.
[53:18.160 --> 53:19.720]  So I do like your idea with the
[53:19.780 --> 53:22.640]  kelp late and absolutely you know
[53:22.700 --> 53:24.320]  and there's another trick that I
[53:24.380 --> 53:25.680]  usually tell people if they're in
[53:25.740 --> 53:27.440]  trouble and that is TM7.
[53:28.240 --> 53:29.820]  And you just talked about trace
[53:29.880 --> 53:31.120]  minerals because you're right.
[53:31.240 --> 53:32.520]  If you don't have the right amount
[53:32.580 --> 53:34.960]  of molybdenum the plant can't
[53:35.020 --> 53:35.520]  function.
[53:35.580 --> 53:36.880]  It's it's you know it's it
[53:36.940 --> 53:39.360]  doesn't have what it needs for so
[53:39.420 --> 53:41.280]  many of those critical processes.
[53:41.960 --> 53:44.460]  So I always say kelp and trace
[53:44.520 --> 53:46.880]  minerals and or TM7 as a humic
[53:46.940 --> 53:49.120]  acid form because that helps
[53:49.180 --> 53:50.160]  everybody play nice.
[53:50.560 --> 53:51.640]  So if you're actually in a
[53:51.700 --> 53:53.240]  nutrient bound or a nutrient
[53:53.300 --> 53:55.440]  lockout that should cure the
[53:55.500 --> 53:57.080]  problem and the plant should get
[53:57.140 --> 53:57.880]  back on its feet.
[53:57.960 --> 53:59.600]  But thank you for the seawater
[53:59.660 --> 54:01.100]  tip that that's fucking huge.
[54:02.000 --> 54:03.000]  There's a gold nugget for the
[54:03.060 --> 54:03.560]  crew.
[54:03.620 --> 54:05.340]  You know there's it's also crazy
[54:05.400 --> 54:06.600]  because there's something about
[54:06.920 --> 54:08.960]  the biology in the soil like it.
[54:10.000 --> 54:11.920]  It really likes the seawater.
[54:11.980 --> 54:13.000]  I don't know if it's all the
[54:13.060 --> 54:15.520]  minerals or what but you know
[54:16.800 --> 54:18.560]  but it's really good to apply to
[54:18.620 --> 54:20.480]  native soils anything where you
[54:20.540 --> 54:23.440]  got biology or you know you're I
[54:23.500 --> 54:24.940]  feel like it's not only feeding
[54:25.000 --> 54:26.560]  the plant those micro and trace
[54:26.620 --> 54:30.360]  nutrients but you know and this
[54:30.380 --> 54:32.760]  is just kind of the way I feel
[54:32.820 --> 54:34.140]  I don't know if it's true but I
[54:34.200 --> 54:36.720]  feel like it also feeds the
[54:36.780 --> 54:39.500]  biology provides a great space
[54:39.560 --> 54:41.380]  or helps the biology replicate.
[54:41.440 --> 54:41.940]  I don't know.
[54:42.080 --> 54:43.160]  I think there's something going
[54:43.220 --> 54:44.400]  on there with the biology and
[54:44.460 --> 54:45.120]  seawater.
[54:46.380 --> 54:47.100]  Absolutely.
[54:48.460 --> 54:50.260]  I think too what Greens is
[54:50.320 --> 54:52.200]  describing was kind of like a
[54:52.260 --> 54:54.620]  telltale sign of people that are
[54:54.680 --> 54:56.980]  frustrated with autos is they
[54:57.040 --> 54:58.480]  might even be seasoned farmers
[54:58.540 --> 54:59.520]  and they say that they can just
[54:59.540 --> 55:01.140]  never get it to finish properly.
[55:01.600 --> 55:03.600]  It just doesn't hold the shape
[55:03.660 --> 55:05.180]  or the bag appeal that it needs
[55:05.880 --> 55:07.600]  the smell that it needs by the
[55:07.660 --> 55:08.940]  time it gets to the customer.
[55:09.660 --> 55:11.760]  So I would say a cautionary
[55:11.820 --> 55:14.060]  thing to Greens maybe you know
[55:15.340 --> 55:16.840]  think about who you're getting
[55:16.900 --> 55:18.280]  your genetics from because if it
[55:18.340 --> 55:19.360]  is just from a friend or
[55:19.420 --> 55:20.220]  something like that or you're
[55:20.280 --> 55:21.540]  growing genetics that might not
[55:21.600 --> 55:22.660]  be as established.
[55:24.300 --> 55:25.560]  Most of the community in
[55:25.620 --> 55:27.380]  Colorado you know behind the
[55:27.380 --> 55:29.000]  scenes is written off.
[55:29.520 --> 55:31.360]  I would say most of the auto
[55:31.420 --> 55:32.840]  breeders because of that because
[55:32.900 --> 55:34.220]  they just can't take the time to
[55:34.280 --> 55:36.920]  waste and see if it works out.
[55:37.720 --> 55:38.880]  It sounds like that might also be
[55:38.940 --> 55:40.400]  what you're experiencing is just
[55:41.200 --> 55:43.700]  you know genetics that were 5 10
[55:43.760 --> 55:45.280]  trying to be in the NBA is not
[55:45.340 --> 55:45.840]  going to work out.
[55:46.760 --> 55:47.240]  Oh shit.
[55:47.300 --> 55:48.040]  Do we lose him.
[55:48.640 --> 55:49.140]  Yeah.
[55:49.360 --> 55:50.480]  We just lost him there.
[55:51.000 --> 55:51.500]  All right.
[55:51.560 --> 55:52.560]  He is going to come back.
[55:52.620 --> 55:53.720]  And you know she had another
[55:53.780 --> 55:55.000]  question about lighting.
[55:55.060 --> 55:56.680]  And from what I understand you
[55:56.680 --> 55:57.580]  don't have to worry about
[55:57.640 --> 55:58.140]  lighting.
[55:58.700 --> 55:59.900]  Well I wanted to ask him about
[55:59.960 --> 56:01.060]  that because I think that's
[56:01.120 --> 56:02.980]  another like some people feel in
[56:03.040 --> 56:04.620]  one camp some on the other where
[56:04.680 --> 56:05.980]  it's going to grow no matter
[56:06.040 --> 56:06.540]  what.
[56:06.940 --> 56:08.560]  So some people run at 24.
[56:08.620 --> 56:09.880]  Some people still run it like
[56:09.940 --> 56:12.040]  half and half when they're doing
[56:12.100 --> 56:13.940]  more of autos as like a side
[56:14.000 --> 56:15.020]  plan or side money.
[56:16.580 --> 56:18.060]  I think this one's more for you
[56:18.120 --> 56:18.620]  anyway.
[56:18.680 --> 56:19.720]  Late you're talking about the
[56:19.780 --> 56:22.740]  TM seven helping somebody has
[56:22.800 --> 56:23.340]  some clothes.
[56:24.320 --> 56:24.820]  Bound.
[56:25.480 --> 56:27.000]  Run out of news.
[56:27.680 --> 56:30.280]  We still haven't bounced back.
[56:31.200 --> 56:31.760]  Perfectly.
[56:31.920 --> 56:32.420]  Oh yeah.
[56:32.920 --> 56:33.920]  You got some issues bro.
[56:33.980 --> 56:38.200]  So you know I would say if you
[56:38.260 --> 56:41.240]  have good compost make an
[56:41.300 --> 56:42.040]  extract.
[56:42.160 --> 56:44.000]  That's that's a real important
[56:44.060 --> 56:44.560]  bump.
[56:44.880 --> 56:46.320]  Humic acid because that's going
[56:46.380 --> 56:49.020]  to if it is a new tree that
[56:49.080 --> 56:50.880]  imbalance that will help to
[56:51.440 --> 56:53.160]  calm everything down and then
[56:53.180 --> 56:54.420]  hormone plant hormones.
[56:54.480 --> 56:56.460]  So your Calpa get you hit.
[56:57.300 --> 56:58.900]  So many people have hit me up on
[56:58.960 --> 57:00.660]  that question and I sent that
[57:00.720 --> 57:02.520]  out to them and they've all come
[57:02.580 --> 57:04.260]  back and said wow that worked
[57:04.320 --> 57:04.980]  fantastic.
[57:05.060 --> 57:07.580]  So that's definitely a trick to
[57:08.020 --> 57:09.460]  breaking that when you don't
[57:09.520 --> 57:10.700]  know what it is but you've got
[57:10.760 --> 57:11.660]  to have good biology.
[57:11.740 --> 57:13.180]  That's that's the hard part.
[57:14.220 --> 57:15.860]  So anyway there was another
[57:15.920 --> 57:17.040]  question about lighting.
[57:17.140 --> 57:18.620]  How long to leave the lights on
[57:19.340 --> 57:20.020]  with your office.
[57:20.800 --> 57:24.140]  I like to always provide a sleep
[57:24.200 --> 57:24.700]  period.
[57:24.760 --> 57:27.140]  So you know I have an experience
[57:27.200 --> 57:29.500]  experimented too much with this.
[57:29.980 --> 57:33.220]  I run an 18 18 on with autos.
[57:34.780 --> 57:36.740]  I've tried 12 12 you know I'm
[57:36.800 --> 57:38.860]  flowering out photos and pop in
[57:39.180 --> 57:41.900]  pop in the autos and I feel like
[57:41.960 --> 57:43.380]  the yield is diminished.
[57:44.900 --> 57:47.660]  At the same time I don't know if
[57:47.720 --> 57:50.340]  adding you know going 20 or 22
[57:50.600 --> 57:53.480]  20 or 22 hours a light you know
[57:53.540 --> 57:56.340]  will really make a difference in
[57:56.400 --> 57:57.920]  yield but it will affect your
[57:57.980 --> 57:59.000]  electricity bill.
[57:59.060 --> 58:00.960]  I found a good medium with 18
[58:01.020 --> 58:01.520]  hours.
[58:04.590 --> 58:06.190]  Now if you had like super high
[58:06.250 --> 58:09.830]  efficient LEDs would you run it
[58:10.190 --> 58:11.950]  closer to like the 22 hours
[58:12.010 --> 58:13.470]  because some I know some people
[58:13.530 --> 58:15.430]  even run it just leave it as 24.
[58:16.270 --> 58:18.390]  I do have super efficient LEDs.
[58:18.550 --> 58:20.230]  I still run everything 18.
[58:21.210 --> 58:21.710]  Yeah.
[58:23.090 --> 58:23.590]  Yeah.
[58:23.810 --> 58:25.810]  So this one's a little far out
[58:25.870 --> 58:26.370]  there.
[58:26.850 --> 58:30.410]  There was some talk from Kevin
[58:30.470 --> 58:33.670]  John actually about giving the
[58:33.730 --> 58:34.650]  plants a nap.
[58:35.470 --> 58:37.330]  So not like killing the lights
[58:37.390 --> 58:39.050]  in the day but having a period
[58:39.110 --> 58:42.410]  where you lower it down for an
[58:42.470 --> 58:44.650]  hour or so and then bring it back
[58:44.710 --> 58:45.810]  up to full spectrum.
[58:45.890 --> 58:47.050]  Have you ever heard anything
[58:47.110 --> 58:48.610]  about or try anything like that.
[58:49.590 --> 58:50.090]  Wow.
[58:50.150 --> 58:52.510]  You know I haven't but I like I
[58:52.570 --> 58:54.950]  like the thought of that and
[58:55.430 --> 58:57.310]  it's it would be interesting to
[58:57.730 --> 58:59.590]  do some experiments and try.
[58:59.650 --> 59:02.830]  But but yeah I mean we like we
[59:02.890 --> 59:04.210]  like rest during the day.
[59:05.250 --> 59:07.290]  You know those lights are a good
[59:07.350 --> 59:08.070]  fucking now.
[59:10.150 --> 59:12.510]  You get recharged and then all
[59:12.570 --> 59:13.630]  of a sudden you can take that
[59:13.870 --> 59:15.470]  excess of energy you just got
[59:15.530 --> 59:16.030]  that boost.
[59:16.090 --> 59:16.810]  I love it.
[59:16.870 --> 59:17.830]  That's brilliant.
[59:17.830 --> 59:20.110]  That that's not just a gold bar
[59:20.170 --> 59:20.670]  time.
[59:20.730 --> 59:22.050]  I'm that please.
[59:22.690 --> 59:23.850]  Somebody needs to write that one
[59:23.910 --> 59:24.690]  down guys.
[59:25.690 --> 59:27.330]  Well I should thank Kevin for
[59:27.390 --> 59:27.890]  that.
[59:27.950 --> 59:29.130]  I don't know where he got it.
[59:29.290 --> 59:30.530]  You know we were chopping up
[59:30.590 --> 59:32.050]  theory shit one day.
[59:32.610 --> 59:33.530]  You started talking about
[59:33.590 --> 59:35.050]  napping and I'm like wow that's
[59:35.110 --> 59:36.290]  a fucking great idea.
[59:36.730 --> 59:37.690]  So that one's on him.
[59:38.210 --> 59:39.450]  Why do we meditate.
[59:40.210 --> 59:41.950]  That's exactly why we meditate.
[59:42.170 --> 59:43.810]  Give our plants a meditation too.
[59:43.870 --> 59:44.370]  Why not.
[59:44.410 --> 59:44.910]  Hell.
[59:48.490 --> 59:50.650]  There is a couple of things I
[59:50.710 --> 59:52.970]  wanted to cover guys that I
[59:53.030 --> 59:54.370]  think people in the community
[59:54.430 --> 59:57.210]  are doing wrong here with this
[59:57.270 --> 59:59.410]  IMO and with some of these
[59:59.470 --> 01:00:02.250]  inputs and Harvard harvesting
[01:00:02.310 --> 01:00:04.770]  and and you know sometimes it
[01:00:04.830 --> 01:00:06.130]  can be hard when you live in a
[01:00:06.190 --> 01:00:07.730]  city you're like oh man I want
[01:00:07.790 --> 01:00:10.290]  to make an FPGA and and you
[01:00:10.350 --> 01:00:11.930]  know you're like you're going to
[01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:13.210]  use dandelions.
[01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:14.530]  You know you've got to really be
[01:00:14.590 --> 01:00:16.050]  careful where you're harvesting
[01:00:16.110 --> 01:00:16.810]  these things.
[01:00:18.830 --> 01:00:20.590]  You know you're driving down the
[01:00:20.650 --> 01:00:22.130]  road and you're seeing all those
[01:00:22.190 --> 01:00:23.970]  beautiful dandelions like you
[01:00:24.030 --> 01:00:25.350]  don't want to get anything right
[01:00:25.410 --> 01:00:27.610]  next to a road or you know
[01:00:27.670 --> 01:00:29.470]  there's there's exhaust and
[01:00:29.530 --> 01:00:31.270]  there's emissions and and
[01:00:31.330 --> 01:00:32.670]  oftentimes when these road
[01:00:32.730 --> 01:00:33.790]  systems are built they're
[01:00:33.850 --> 01:00:36.910]  spraying you know chemicals and
[01:00:36.970 --> 01:00:39.090]  stuff and you know a lot of
[01:00:39.150 --> 01:00:43.750]  these these weeds are are you
[01:00:43.810 --> 01:00:45.570]  know little they're accumulators
[01:00:45.630 --> 01:00:47.170]  are going to accumulate anything
[01:00:47.450 --> 01:00:49.330]  that's right there in the soil
[01:00:49.390 --> 01:00:51.190]  and so so if you're out there
[01:00:51.250 --> 01:00:53.170]  trying to trying to harvest
[01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:57.250]  stuff it needs to be and you
[01:00:57.310 --> 01:00:59.190]  know untouched places that
[01:00:59.250 --> 01:01:00.730]  aren't getting sprayed or
[01:01:00.790 --> 01:01:03.790]  treated or getting exhaust
[01:01:03.850 --> 01:01:06.790]  emissions because you will lock
[01:01:06.850 --> 01:01:08.050]  that stuff right into your
[01:01:08.110 --> 01:01:08.610]  ferment.
[01:01:09.870 --> 01:01:12.630]  So that's a big thing that I see
[01:01:12.690 --> 01:01:15.850]  people do and you know and the
[01:01:16.170 --> 01:01:20.370]  cities harvesting you know stuff
[01:01:20.430 --> 01:01:23.170]  from cracks in the ground or or
[01:01:24.050 --> 01:01:26.290]  it's an interesting concept but
[01:01:27.370 --> 01:01:30.450]  just because a banana just
[01:01:30.510 --> 01:01:31.610]  because it's a banana doesn't
[01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:33.770]  mean it's high in potassium you
[01:01:33.830 --> 01:01:36.130]  know the the the fruit is only
[01:01:36.190 --> 01:01:38.850]  going to be as good as as what
[01:01:38.910 --> 01:01:40.570]  was available in the soil for
[01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:41.570]  that plant to grow.
[01:01:41.630 --> 01:01:43.670]  So if that banana tree was grown
[01:01:43.730 --> 01:01:45.730]  in a potassium deficient soil
[01:01:45.770 --> 01:01:47.490]  it's not going to have it within
[01:01:47.550 --> 01:01:48.130]  its flesh.
[01:01:48.190 --> 01:01:49.410]  So just because you see a
[01:01:49.470 --> 01:01:51.610]  dandelion doesn't mean it's
[01:01:51.670 --> 01:01:53.290]  chock full of nutrients.
[01:01:53.770 --> 01:01:55.010]  You know it could just be
[01:01:55.070 --> 01:01:56.650]  growing and surviving and have
[01:01:56.890 --> 01:01:58.250]  you know the bare amount of
[01:01:58.310 --> 01:02:00.810]  nutrients and and dandelions are
[01:02:00.870 --> 01:02:03.370]  packed like they accumulate
[01:02:03.430 --> 01:02:03.930]  there.
[01:02:03.990 --> 01:02:05.570]  Sometimes called the land kelp
[01:02:05.970 --> 01:02:07.850]  they accumulate all sorts of
[01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:09.110]  whatever's in the soil they're
[01:02:09.170 --> 01:02:10.290]  just going to uptake it.
[01:02:11.230 --> 01:02:13.610]  So so you want to make sure
[01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:14.890]  you're you're getting it from
[01:02:14.930 --> 01:02:17.230]  like a you know nice native
[01:02:17.290 --> 01:02:19.430]  soil or somewhere where where
[01:02:19.490 --> 01:02:21.050]  there's new nutrition to be
[01:02:21.110 --> 01:02:24.490]  unlocked and and just make sure
[01:02:24.550 --> 01:02:25.430]  you're not getting them from
[01:02:25.490 --> 01:02:26.930]  roadsides because that's one of
[01:02:26.990 --> 01:02:28.510]  the easiest things people do
[01:02:28.570 --> 01:02:29.770]  and they're driving home and
[01:02:29.830 --> 01:02:31.970]  there's and they can see it from
[01:02:32.030 --> 01:02:33.570]  their car and just pull right
[01:02:33.630 --> 01:02:35.170]  over and harvest it.
[01:02:35.230 --> 01:02:35.970]  Don't do that.
[01:02:37.290 --> 01:02:39.490]  So another thing I hear people
[01:02:39.550 --> 01:02:41.170]  doing is like oh well I'm going
[01:02:41.230 --> 01:02:44.130]  to collect IMO you know here in
[01:02:44.130 --> 01:02:46.490]  my basement because that's where
[01:02:46.550 --> 01:02:49.290]  my tent is or you know these are
[01:02:50.090 --> 01:02:51.930]  improper ways to think about
[01:02:51.990 --> 01:02:54.810]  this stuff like yeah you want
[01:02:55.050 --> 01:02:58.550]  your IMO to be within reason
[01:02:58.610 --> 01:02:59.570]  from the environment you're
[01:02:59.630 --> 01:03:00.790]  going to be growing but that's
[01:03:00.850 --> 01:03:02.950]  kind of the idea of you know
[01:03:03.010 --> 01:03:03.770]  you're going to be growing
[01:03:03.830 --> 01:03:05.650]  outside in your native soil
[01:03:05.710 --> 01:03:08.490]  stuff like don't don't feel bad
[01:03:08.550 --> 01:03:11.210]  to go out to you know drive an
[01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:13.770]  hour out to a forest and find
[01:03:13.970 --> 01:03:16.090]  you know a grove of deciduous
[01:03:16.150 --> 01:03:17.970]  trees and and take your
[01:03:18.030 --> 01:03:19.690]  collection there and then bring
[01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:21.330]  that into your your home.
[01:03:22.770 --> 01:03:25.970]  The point here is to harvest all
[01:03:26.030 --> 01:03:29.370]  those bacterias and fungis and
[01:03:29.450 --> 01:03:31.170]  and and yeasts that are in the
[01:03:31.230 --> 01:03:35.490]  soil that are in like these
[01:03:35.550 --> 01:03:38.010]  these forest systems that that
[01:03:38.070 --> 01:03:40.490]  have like you know established
[01:03:40.490 --> 01:03:43.730]  this this this like hierarchy
[01:03:43.790 --> 01:03:45.530]  that works with each other of
[01:03:45.810 --> 01:03:47.850]  biology you're trying to lock
[01:03:47.910 --> 01:03:52.650]  that in place you know so you
[01:03:52.710 --> 01:03:53.530]  just want to make sure you're
[01:03:53.590 --> 01:03:54.770]  getting your IMO collections
[01:03:54.830 --> 01:03:56.250]  from good places and make sure
[01:03:56.310 --> 01:03:57.690]  you're the plants you're
[01:03:57.750 --> 01:03:59.650]  harvesting to use for these
[01:03:59.710 --> 01:04:02.870]  ferments are also being
[01:04:02.930 --> 01:04:04.690]  harvested in good places.
[01:04:04.750 --> 01:04:08.250]  So I think that's really good
[01:04:08.310 --> 01:04:09.290]  solid information.
[01:04:09.290 --> 01:04:11.010]  I mean I've I've actually done
[01:04:11.070 --> 01:04:12.550]  a different approach like I've
[01:04:12.610 --> 01:04:14.550]  found plants that are you know
[01:04:14.610 --> 01:04:17.510]  extremely abused and used them
[01:04:17.570 --> 01:04:18.430]  in my compost.
[01:04:18.490 --> 01:04:20.770]  Now the compost process itself
[01:04:21.110 --> 01:04:23.030]  will break down a lot of these
[01:04:23.370 --> 01:04:25.410]  potential pesticides.
[01:04:26.210 --> 01:04:28.090]  So it's not as it's not as big
[01:04:28.150 --> 01:04:28.810]  of an issue.
[01:04:28.890 --> 01:04:30.170]  But if you're using it in a
[01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:31.330]  ferment yeah you're you're
[01:04:31.390 --> 01:04:32.790]  definitely locking everything
[01:04:32.850 --> 01:04:34.390]  up and putting all those things
[01:04:34.450 --> 01:04:35.570]  right back on the plant.
[01:04:36.010 --> 01:04:37.730]  And concentrating it.
[01:04:37.730 --> 01:04:39.410]  Don't forget in a ferment you're
[01:04:39.470 --> 01:04:41.450]  concentrating this stuff guys
[01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:42.970]  you don't want to concentrate
[01:04:43.030 --> 01:04:43.650]  the bad stuff.
[01:04:44.890 --> 01:04:45.810]  And I think you know here's
[01:04:45.870 --> 01:04:46.910]  that here's a little tip for
[01:04:46.970 --> 01:04:48.230]  people that are in the city.
[01:04:48.490 --> 01:04:49.810]  You got to have family other
[01:04:49.870 --> 01:04:51.450]  places in the country right.
[01:04:51.530 --> 01:04:52.730]  Or if you don't you got to have
[01:04:52.790 --> 01:04:54.010]  friends from other places.
[01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:56.330]  So have them have them pick it
[01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:57.770]  for you and send it to you and
[01:04:57.830 --> 01:04:59.450]  then you can use it or go out
[01:04:59.510 --> 01:04:59.970]  harvest.
[01:05:00.030 --> 01:05:01.250]  Take a take a field trip.
[01:05:01.810 --> 01:05:02.970]  But no that was really really
[01:05:03.030 --> 01:05:03.570]  good advice.
[01:05:03.570 --> 01:05:03.850]  I.
[01:05:04.650 --> 01:05:05.610]  Part of that I don't know if is
[01:05:05.670 --> 01:05:07.090]  apples to apples because I know
[01:05:07.150 --> 01:05:08.290]  when you're when you're talking
[01:05:08.350 --> 01:05:09.450]  late and you're also going to
[01:05:09.510 --> 01:05:11.730]  the obscures to get the you
[01:05:11.790 --> 01:05:13.730]  know the alpha microbes.
[01:05:14.530 --> 01:05:16.250]  So I wanted to ask you
[01:05:16.330 --> 01:05:17.250]  autofire what do you think of
[01:05:17.330 --> 01:05:20.050]  that from an IMO perspective is
[01:05:20.130 --> 01:05:21.450]  like you know going to where it
[01:05:21.530 --> 01:05:23.410]  be extremely hard for something
[01:05:23.490 --> 01:05:24.970]  to grow between maybe some rocks
[01:05:25.030 --> 01:05:26.450]  not necessarily by the road but
[01:05:26.770 --> 01:05:27.850]  you know between some rocks or
[01:05:27.910 --> 01:05:28.930]  something like that that
[01:05:29.010 --> 01:05:30.530]  microbial life in there
[01:05:30.930 --> 01:05:31.970]  potentially you know you're
[01:05:31.970 --> 01:05:33.170]  microbial life in there
[01:05:33.610 --> 01:05:35.290]  potentially could be pretty
[01:05:35.970 --> 01:05:36.850]  pretty strong.
[01:05:39.730 --> 01:05:41.770]  Yeah diversity is key.
[01:05:42.170 --> 01:05:45.010]  You know if I feel like bringing
[01:05:45.070 --> 01:05:47.090]  in a collection like that and
[01:05:47.170 --> 01:05:50.130]  you know adding it to your other
[01:05:50.210 --> 01:05:52.610]  collections and you know I
[01:05:52.690 --> 01:05:54.290]  can't I don't have much
[01:05:54.350 --> 01:05:55.410]  experience with that.
[01:05:55.470 --> 01:05:56.850]  So anything that I'm about to
[01:05:56.910 --> 01:05:59.610]  say is kind of just like I don't
[01:05:59.670 --> 01:06:01.050]  know not even anecdotal.
[01:06:01.970 --> 01:06:05.050]  But diver you always hear
[01:06:05.110 --> 01:06:06.330]  diversity is key.
[01:06:06.410 --> 01:06:08.090]  So bring in a collection like
[01:06:08.150 --> 01:06:10.570]  that you know I'm sure that it
[01:06:10.650 --> 01:06:11.690]  would be beneficial.
[01:06:12.810 --> 01:06:13.970]  You're harvesting a different
[01:06:14.030 --> 01:06:15.330]  range of microbes.
[01:06:16.330 --> 01:06:19.090]  So bring it in.
[01:06:20.690 --> 01:06:23.490]  But to be honest the harvesting
[01:06:24.290 --> 01:06:26.010]  in our environment up here it's
[01:06:26.250 --> 01:06:27.930]  it's cold it's wet.
[01:06:27.930 --> 01:06:33.090]  I've had a lot of trouble
[01:06:33.170 --> 01:06:35.290]  harvesting IMO over the years
[01:06:35.350 --> 01:06:38.370]  you know I maybe have like 25
[01:06:38.430 --> 01:06:39.650]  percent success.
[01:06:40.290 --> 01:06:42.250]  So recently I've been trying to
[01:06:42.310 --> 01:06:44.050]  mitigate that problem by just
[01:06:44.110 --> 01:06:46.010]  putting out a whole shit load of
[01:06:46.070 --> 01:06:46.930]  boxes.
[01:06:49.810 --> 01:06:51.630]  But if you're in a dry area and
[01:06:51.690 --> 01:06:53.010]  collecting from around raw like
[01:06:53.070 --> 01:06:55.770]  moving rocks back and maybe
[01:06:55.770 --> 01:06:58.970]  you'd have an easier time
[01:06:59.030 --> 01:07:00.370]  collecting stuff like that.
[01:07:00.430 --> 01:07:02.530]  But all my collections have been
[01:07:03.170 --> 01:07:05.050]  been from forests underneath
[01:07:05.110 --> 01:07:06.490]  deciduous trees.
[01:07:06.930 --> 01:07:09.170]  I've even tried avoiding you
[01:07:09.230 --> 01:07:10.970]  know all the evergreen areas
[01:07:11.030 --> 01:07:12.250]  like with the spruce.
[01:07:12.310 --> 01:07:15.770]  I noticed that the forest layer
[01:07:15.830 --> 01:07:18.370]  underneath it's it's it's
[01:07:18.430 --> 01:07:20.330]  definitely more acidic.
[01:07:20.730 --> 01:07:22.730]  A certain type of small plant
[01:07:22.810 --> 01:07:23.970]  only certain types of small
[01:07:24.030 --> 01:07:25.250]  plants will grow there.
[01:07:25.650 --> 01:07:29.370]  So I generally tend to find
[01:07:29.430 --> 01:07:31.610]  myself working towards the areas
[01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:33.610]  that are you know deciduous tree
[01:07:33.770 --> 01:07:35.450]  deciduous trees stuff where
[01:07:35.770 --> 01:07:37.050]  trees with leaves.
[01:07:38.090 --> 01:07:40.090]  So you know like the birch or
[01:07:40.330 --> 01:07:42.210]  birch is real common around here
[01:07:42.270 --> 01:07:43.970]  so that's usually my go to.
[01:07:45.570 --> 01:07:47.570]  See Green Goddess is saying she
[01:07:47.630 --> 01:07:48.890]  heard that you don't want
[01:07:49.530 --> 01:07:51.170]  collections from around pine
[01:07:51.410 --> 01:07:54.450]  pine trees and and and
[01:07:54.730 --> 01:07:56.810]  guarantee it's because the very
[01:07:56.890 --> 01:08:01.050]  acidic nature of of the soil
[01:08:01.370 --> 01:08:05.850]  which probably I imagine has a
[01:08:05.910 --> 01:08:07.210]  different group of microbes
[01:08:07.270 --> 01:08:08.010]  going on there.
[01:08:08.330 --> 01:08:11.770]  So I haven't tried it per se.
[01:08:12.370 --> 01:08:14.970]  I learned from Chris Trump that
[01:08:15.030 --> 01:08:16.610]  we're supposed to collect it
[01:08:17.250 --> 01:08:19.050]  and Boris underneath deciduous
[01:08:19.110 --> 01:08:20.250]  trees and that's the only way
[01:08:20.310 --> 01:08:21.850]  I've ever ever really done it.
[01:08:24.310 --> 01:08:25.430]  How windy is it up there.
[01:08:27.910 --> 01:08:30.070]  We get when we get wind storms
[01:08:30.130 --> 01:08:31.630]  when the weather starting to
[01:08:31.710 --> 01:08:32.950]  change when we're gone from
[01:08:33.010 --> 01:08:35.550]  winter to spring and from fall
[01:08:35.610 --> 01:08:36.430]  to winter.
[01:08:36.590 --> 01:08:38.710]  Other than that we're I mean
[01:08:38.790 --> 01:08:40.470]  there's trees everywhere.
[01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:43.030]  If you were to get in a plane
[01:08:43.110 --> 01:08:45.670]  and fly off from our little
[01:08:45.730 --> 01:08:47.710]  town you would see a tiny little
[01:08:47.770 --> 01:08:50.070]  speck of civilization which is
[01:08:50.130 --> 01:08:52.430]  our town and then trees as
[01:08:52.430 --> 01:08:53.790]  far as you can see.
[01:08:54.150 --> 01:08:56.630]  So the trees really work as wind
[01:08:56.690 --> 01:08:57.870]  breaks around here.
[01:08:58.630 --> 01:09:01.630]  So we experience minimal wind
[01:09:01.710 --> 01:09:04.110]  except for during those those
[01:09:04.190 --> 01:09:05.550]  transition seasons.
[01:09:06.750 --> 01:09:08.190]  When we do get wind though
[01:09:08.270 --> 01:09:09.830]  there's so many trees out here.
[01:09:09.910 --> 01:09:11.470]  Every time there's a wind storm
[01:09:11.550 --> 01:09:13.030]  it knocks trees over onto the
[01:09:13.110 --> 01:09:14.670]  power lines and the power goes
[01:09:14.750 --> 01:09:14.950]  out.
[01:09:15.030 --> 01:09:17.070]  So it's pretty common.
[01:09:18.230 --> 01:09:20.830]  The reason I ask that is when I
[01:09:21.830 --> 01:09:23.830]  did my own IMO collections I
[01:09:23.910 --> 01:09:26.590]  always went to blowdowns or
[01:09:26.670 --> 01:09:28.630]  stone walls and I would collect
[01:09:28.710 --> 01:09:29.870]  on the opposite side of the
[01:09:29.950 --> 01:09:31.870]  prevailing wind because the
[01:09:31.930 --> 01:09:33.910]  leaves build up really high on
[01:09:33.970 --> 01:09:34.590]  the other side.
[01:09:35.390 --> 01:09:36.550]  So I figured I'd throw that
[01:09:36.610 --> 01:09:37.950]  trick at you because it's just
[01:09:38.030 --> 01:09:41.070]  a limited time to harvest it.
[01:09:41.350 --> 01:09:42.590]  That would be the great place to
[01:09:42.670 --> 01:09:42.950]  do it.
[01:09:45.310 --> 01:09:46.830]  That's an interesting concept.
[01:09:47.030 --> 01:09:47.630]  I like that.
[01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:48.150]  Yeah.
[01:09:48.210 --> 01:09:49.990]  So you know I learned that trick
[01:09:50.030 --> 01:09:51.230]  when I was doing work down at
[01:09:51.310 --> 01:09:54.590]  Rodale trying to harvest
[01:09:54.710 --> 01:09:57.030]  indigenous microorganisms for
[01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:58.430]  playing with the microscope.
[01:09:59.030 --> 01:10:00.590]  So to make me better at
[01:10:00.650 --> 01:10:02.430]  microscoping and to start to
[01:10:02.510 --> 01:10:03.790]  understand where I want to
[01:10:03.870 --> 01:10:05.990]  collect forest stuff from to
[01:10:06.070 --> 01:10:07.830]  make my compost I would run
[01:10:07.910 --> 01:10:09.110]  around and take all these
[01:10:09.190 --> 01:10:10.270]  samples from all these different
[01:10:10.350 --> 01:10:12.470]  areas and I learned that I would
[01:10:12.550 --> 01:10:14.390]  always get incredible diversity.
[01:10:14.470 --> 01:10:16.030]  I'd get tons of nematodes
[01:10:16.110 --> 01:10:18.670]  micro-arthropods everything from
[01:10:18.710 --> 01:10:20.630]  that little area because the
[01:10:20.710 --> 01:10:21.590]  duff was so deep.
[01:10:22.150 --> 01:10:23.230]  You have to just keep digging
[01:10:23.310 --> 01:10:24.510]  down you have to peel back to
[01:10:24.590 --> 01:10:26.110]  the wet area you know like when
[01:10:26.190 --> 01:10:27.030]  you start to get like the
[01:10:27.110 --> 01:10:28.590]  leaves that are really rotten
[01:10:28.670 --> 01:10:31.350]  and sticky and you know smoking
[01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:31.710]  wet.
[01:10:32.110 --> 01:10:33.110]  That's when you start to get
[01:10:33.190 --> 01:10:34.070]  into the magic area.
[01:10:34.150 --> 01:10:34.990]  So give that a shot.
[01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:36.710]  I'd love to hear you know how
[01:10:36.790 --> 01:10:37.470]  it worked out for you.
[01:10:38.350 --> 01:10:39.910]  Well I never went to your farms
[01:10:39.990 --> 01:10:41.310]  just said if you have acorn
[01:10:41.390 --> 01:10:43.230]  trees you have a gold mine for
[01:10:43.310 --> 01:10:44.470]  what we're talking about right
[01:10:44.550 --> 01:10:44.630]  here.
[01:10:45.310 --> 01:10:47.710]  And you start in the backyard.
[01:10:48.070 --> 01:10:49.510]  I'm talking oaks are wonderful
[01:10:51.110 --> 01:10:52.230]  diversity is where it's at.
[01:10:52.310 --> 01:10:53.750]  But anytime I've ever been in
[01:10:53.830 --> 01:10:55.430]  the woods and there's it's
[01:10:55.510 --> 01:10:58.710]  super healthy for like
[01:10:58.790 --> 01:11:00.550]  mycorrhizal fungi or duff and
[01:11:00.630 --> 01:11:02.790]  all that it's there's acorn
[01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:04.270]  trees everywhere around that.
[01:11:05.110 --> 01:11:06.470]  So it's pretty interesting that
[01:11:07.110 --> 01:11:09.190]  you know because when you do
[01:11:09.270 --> 01:11:09.950]  this man when you're first
[01:11:10.030 --> 01:11:11.270]  getting into it it's kind of
[01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:12.630]  frustrating and to kind of get
[01:11:12.710 --> 01:11:15.510]  the eye of you know that that
[01:11:15.590 --> 01:11:16.990]  wood over there that's decaying
[01:11:16.990 --> 01:11:18.230]  that that's probably just a
[01:11:18.310 --> 01:11:19.110]  little bit better than the
[01:11:19.190 --> 01:11:20.030]  other piece that looked like it
[01:11:20.110 --> 01:11:21.230]  was decaying but there's nothing
[01:11:21.310 --> 01:11:21.830]  underneath it.
[01:11:24.110 --> 01:11:25.150]  I know Leighton probably has
[01:11:25.230 --> 01:11:26.550]  that eye since he was young but
[01:11:27.630 --> 01:11:28.990]  I felt like for me I'd be out
[01:11:29.070 --> 01:11:30.510]  in the woods you know burning
[01:11:30.590 --> 01:11:31.830]  with your friends and just kind
[01:11:31.910 --> 01:11:33.390]  of doing it but it took a
[01:11:33.470 --> 01:11:35.390]  minute to kind of see the spots
[01:11:36.150 --> 01:11:37.590]  that I felt like were really
[01:11:37.670 --> 01:11:38.470]  worth the effort.
[01:11:39.550 --> 01:11:40.630]  And that might be we're not
[01:11:40.710 --> 01:11:41.750]  going deeper enough in
[01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:45.030]  Colorado but you know I don't
[01:11:45.110 --> 01:11:46.110]  think anything compares to
[01:11:46.230 --> 01:11:46.910]  Alaska though.
[01:11:49.950 --> 01:11:51.190]  Yeah well what do you guys
[01:11:51.270 --> 01:11:54.070]  think should you want to shift
[01:11:54.150 --> 01:11:55.630]  this conversation to some
[01:11:55.910 --> 01:11:58.870]  nutrient talk and you know kind
[01:11:58.950 --> 01:12:02.070]  of give people an idea of ways
[01:12:02.150 --> 01:12:03.830]  they can save some money because
[01:12:03.910 --> 01:12:05.670]  we all know about fertilizer
[01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:07.030]  costs these days.
[01:12:08.350 --> 01:12:09.030]  Absolutely.
[01:12:09.110 --> 01:12:09.910]  And you're definitely at the
[01:12:09.990 --> 01:12:10.990]  forefront of that.
[01:12:12.030 --> 01:12:13.310]  And I know there's another
[01:12:13.390 --> 01:12:14.350]  question I'll ask you after
[01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:16.190]  this but people really want to
[01:12:16.270 --> 01:12:18.110]  know you know you're out there
[01:12:18.190 --> 01:12:19.550]  killing and then making your
[01:12:19.630 --> 01:12:20.870]  input so people kind of wanted
[01:12:20.950 --> 01:12:22.150]  to dive deeper into that.
[01:12:24.190 --> 01:12:25.470]  Yeah absolutely.
[01:12:25.550 --> 01:12:26.950]  Well we live a subsistence
[01:12:27.030 --> 01:12:27.150]  life.
[01:12:27.230 --> 01:12:28.550]  Let's start there because that
[01:12:28.630 --> 01:12:30.190]  will lead into the nutrients.
[01:12:31.030 --> 01:12:32.030]  You know we kind of live this
[01:12:32.110 --> 01:12:33.950]  subsistence lifestyle out here.
[01:12:34.030 --> 01:12:36.750]  We're fortunate that you know
[01:12:36.830 --> 01:12:38.190]  there's not many people that
[01:12:38.270 --> 01:12:38.990]  live up here.
[01:12:39.070 --> 01:12:40.110]  I mean the whole state of
[01:12:40.190 --> 01:12:41.910]  Alaska which is probably the
[01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:43.830]  third though land of the United
[01:12:43.870 --> 01:12:46.310]  States has less than a million
[01:12:46.390 --> 01:12:46.910]  people.
[01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:50.750]  So the game animals are plenty.
[01:12:51.110 --> 01:12:54.590]  The salmon are plenty and the
[01:12:54.670 --> 01:12:58.350]  state provides these
[01:12:58.830 --> 01:13:00.670]  subsistence programs for the
[01:13:00.750 --> 01:13:02.150]  harvesting of salmon.
[01:13:02.590 --> 01:13:05.950]  So every year my my wife and
[01:13:06.030 --> 01:13:09.310]  daughter and I we go out and we
[01:13:09.390 --> 01:13:11.030]  participate in something called
[01:13:11.110 --> 01:13:13.790]  dip netting and we you know we
[01:13:13.870 --> 01:13:17.030]  catch anywhere from like 20 to
[01:13:17.110 --> 01:13:21.310]  100 salmon and we process that
[01:13:21.390 --> 01:13:25.390]  down and and use all the fillets
[01:13:25.470 --> 01:13:27.030]  we make smoked salmon and we
[01:13:27.110 --> 01:13:28.190]  vacuum seal that.
[01:13:28.270 --> 01:13:30.310]  And the idea is to get a year's
[01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:34.150]  worth of salmon and the freezer
[01:13:34.390 --> 01:13:36.150]  from one go essentially.
[01:13:36.310 --> 01:13:39.030]  But that ends up creating a fair
[01:13:39.110 --> 01:13:42.910]  amount of waste of heads guts
[01:13:43.150 --> 01:13:45.630]  the scraps the spines the tails
[01:13:45.710 --> 01:13:47.430]  all that kind of stuff.
[01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:51.790]  So I end up loading all my
[01:13:51.870 --> 01:13:54.030]  scraps up and everyone's scraps
[01:13:54.110 --> 01:13:56.430]  who you know is around and most
[01:13:56.510 --> 01:13:57.710]  people are just throwing them
[01:13:57.790 --> 01:13:59.510]  right back into the rivers and
[01:13:59.590 --> 01:14:01.950]  the oceans and I just gather
[01:14:02.030 --> 01:14:04.750]  them and I bring them back and I
[01:14:04.830 --> 01:14:06.110]  ferment them and I turn them
[01:14:06.190 --> 01:14:07.510]  into FAA.
[01:14:07.590 --> 01:14:11.230]  And when I first tried doing
[01:14:11.230 --> 01:14:13.150]  this my wife was she gave me a
[01:14:13.230 --> 01:14:15.510]  hard time and she she didn't
[01:14:15.590 --> 01:14:17.150]  want me fermenting fish in the
[01:14:17.230 --> 01:14:19.910]  house and you know I told her
[01:14:19.990 --> 01:14:22.510]  well she was pregnant at the
[01:14:22.590 --> 01:14:25.390]  time and her.
[01:14:25.550 --> 01:14:27.310]  This is four years ago my
[01:14:27.390 --> 01:14:31.270]  daughter's four now and she she
[01:14:31.350 --> 01:14:33.270]  was really adamant about it and
[01:14:33.350 --> 01:14:34.830]  I was like well you know you're
[01:14:34.910 --> 01:14:36.830]  just going to have to to live
[01:14:36.910 --> 01:14:38.550]  with it because I'm doing this
[01:14:38.630 --> 01:14:40.070]  and everything that I've ever
[01:14:40.110 --> 01:14:42.310]  heard says it doesn't smell and
[01:14:42.390 --> 01:14:44.470]  so you know I end up starting
[01:14:44.550 --> 01:14:46.750]  this fermentation and about like
[01:14:46.830 --> 01:14:49.030]  I mean really within within the
[01:14:49.110 --> 01:14:52.350]  first day or two that the brown
[01:14:52.430 --> 01:14:55.510]  sugar knocks down any fish smell
[01:14:55.590 --> 01:14:58.190]  and and it's ends up becoming
[01:14:58.270 --> 01:14:59.950]  more like you know even through
[01:15:00.030 --> 01:15:02.550]  the whole fermentation process
[01:15:02.630 --> 01:15:04.230]  if it's not kept too hot.
[01:15:04.310 --> 01:15:05.510]  I mean if you got it out in the
[01:15:05.590 --> 01:15:09.870]  80 degree shed or something like
[01:15:09.910 --> 01:15:11.710]  it's going to smell fishy but if
[01:15:11.790 --> 01:15:13.310]  you get it down in a spot that
[01:15:13.390 --> 01:15:14.630]  stays cool underneath the
[01:15:14.710 --> 01:15:16.670]  cupboard or like you know in a
[01:15:16.750 --> 01:15:18.630]  closet or down in a crawl space
[01:15:18.710 --> 01:15:20.190]  or basement like that's that's
[01:15:20.270 --> 01:15:20.830]  perfect.
[01:15:20.910 --> 01:15:24.750]  And but after a couple of months
[01:15:24.830 --> 01:15:26.470]  or so it had developed this big
[01:15:26.550 --> 01:15:29.030]  thick mold mat on top like it
[01:15:29.110 --> 01:15:31.550]  does and I get my wife to go
[01:15:31.630 --> 01:15:32.990]  down there and I pull it back
[01:15:33.070 --> 01:15:34.390]  I'm like get your head down
[01:15:34.470 --> 01:15:35.870]  there and smell it and she gets
[01:15:35.950 --> 01:15:38.150]  her head down in that bucket and
[01:15:38.230 --> 01:15:39.710]  it right above that mold mat
[01:15:39.710 --> 01:15:41.230]  and takes a whiff and she's like
[01:15:41.310 --> 01:15:43.390]  I can't believe it.
[01:15:43.470 --> 01:15:44.590]  I can't believe it.
[01:15:44.670 --> 01:15:47.510]  And so ever since then she's been
[01:15:47.590 --> 01:15:50.310]  OK with my fermentation of salmon
[01:15:50.390 --> 01:15:52.550]  in the house and I end up
[01:15:52.630 --> 01:15:54.470]  fermenting all the scraps from our
[01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:57.070]  waste every year and I it leaves
[01:15:57.150 --> 01:15:58.470]  me with a whole bunch of extra
[01:15:58.550 --> 01:16:01.310]  FAA than I could use in a year
[01:16:01.390 --> 01:16:03.710]  and I bottle it up and sell it on
[01:16:03.790 --> 01:16:04.790]  a Web site.
[01:16:05.390 --> 01:16:11.190]  And we also have lots of friends
[01:16:11.270 --> 01:16:13.150]  around here that are into
[01:16:13.230 --> 01:16:16.350]  hunting and we're into it as well.
[01:16:16.430 --> 01:16:21.750]  And and the bones of animals make
[01:16:21.830 --> 01:16:24.030]  really amazing phosphorus
[01:16:24.110 --> 01:16:24.790]  sources.
[01:16:24.870 --> 01:16:28.390]  So after we clean all the meat
[01:16:28.470 --> 01:16:31.470]  down all the I'll save the bones
[01:16:31.550 --> 01:16:33.470]  and wrap them up and freeze them
[01:16:33.470 --> 01:16:36.270]  until I till I need them and then
[01:16:36.350 --> 01:16:38.150]  I can char them till they're till
[01:16:38.230 --> 01:16:40.430]  they're black once they start to go
[01:16:40.510 --> 01:16:42.270]  each arm over like you know a
[01:16:42.350 --> 01:16:45.590]  barbecue or a grill or a fire with
[01:16:45.670 --> 01:16:49.190]  a rack on top and and and char
[01:16:49.270 --> 01:16:51.350]  until till they're black and all
[01:16:51.430 --> 01:16:53.390]  the organic matter is gone.
[01:16:53.470 --> 01:16:55.590]  And once the bones start to go
[01:16:55.670 --> 01:16:56.630]  white they've been over
[01:16:56.710 --> 01:16:59.270]  compromised and and yeah so you
[01:16:59.350 --> 01:17:01.830]  take those bones and put them in
[01:17:01.870 --> 01:17:04.390]  vinegar one tenth charred bones to
[01:17:04.470 --> 01:17:05.670]  10 parts.
[01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:07.990]  You know I like to use rice vinegar
[01:17:08.070 --> 01:17:09.870]  because that's traditional K&F.
[01:17:09.950 --> 01:17:11.230]  But I've heard of people having
[01:17:11.310 --> 01:17:12.750]  success with fruit vinegars
[01:17:12.830 --> 01:17:14.270]  basically anything besides white
[01:17:14.350 --> 01:17:15.870]  vinegar.
[01:17:15.950 --> 01:17:18.470]  And yeah just like there's a
[01:17:18.550 --> 01:17:20.630]  chemical reaction that pulls that
[01:17:20.710 --> 01:17:23.150]  calcium phosphate into into
[01:17:23.230 --> 01:17:24.270]  solution.
[01:17:24.350 --> 01:17:26.710]  It's interesting because you know a
[01:17:26.790 --> 01:17:28.110]  lot of people have plenty of
[01:17:28.190 --> 01:17:31.590]  phosphorus in their soil but it's
[01:17:31.590 --> 01:17:33.550]  not in a plant usable form which
[01:17:33.630 --> 01:17:35.990]  is you know why there's been such
[01:17:36.070 --> 01:17:38.070]  an increase in popularity of stuff
[01:17:38.150 --> 01:17:40.390]  like mammoth pea and and because
[01:17:40.470 --> 01:17:42.670]  they solubilize that phosphorus
[01:17:42.750 --> 01:17:44.470]  and and and turn it into a
[01:17:44.550 --> 01:17:46.790]  phosphate which is plant available
[01:17:46.870 --> 01:17:48.550]  form for the plant to uptake that
[01:17:48.630 --> 01:17:49.630]  phosphorus.
[01:17:49.710 --> 01:17:53.070]  Well when you're doing this with
[01:17:53.150 --> 01:17:58.470]  these bones and and extracting the
[01:17:58.550 --> 01:18:00.430]  the phosphorus into solution with
[01:18:00.550 --> 01:18:02.030]  the chemical reaction that happens
[01:18:02.110 --> 01:18:04.190]  from the vinegar the form that
[01:18:04.270 --> 01:18:05.470]  you're getting is calcium
[01:18:05.550 --> 01:18:06.270]  phosphate.
[01:18:06.350 --> 01:18:07.950]  So you are getting phosphate in a
[01:18:08.030 --> 01:18:09.910]  usable form but also it's tied to
[01:18:09.990 --> 01:18:11.550]  calcium so you're getting calcium
[01:18:11.630 --> 01:18:13.470]  as well.
[01:18:13.550 --> 01:18:16.190]  So it's a pretty cool and easy way
[01:18:16.270 --> 01:18:22.470]  to to get a free phosphorus source
[01:18:22.550 --> 01:18:25.350]  for your plants and and it's really
[01:18:25.430 --> 01:18:27.270]  cool because you start showing any
[01:18:27.350 --> 01:18:28.950]  phosphorus deficiencies.
[01:18:28.990 --> 01:18:31.630]  I mean you just you know pop eight
[01:18:31.710 --> 01:18:34.590]  milliliters into a gallon of water
[01:18:34.670 --> 01:18:37.230]  and foliar and boom you can correct
[01:18:37.310 --> 01:18:41.790]  those deficiencies.
[01:18:41.870 --> 01:18:43.470]  That's one thing that I feel like a
[01:18:43.550 --> 01:18:45.150]  lot of people could really benefit
[01:18:45.230 --> 01:18:47.910]  from this style because really going
[01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:51.030]  into it from top to bottom you know
[01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:53.550]  you got to make a lot of things then
[01:18:53.630 --> 01:18:55.350]  learn how to use it and the amount of
[01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:58.310]  information on how to use this is so
[01:18:58.390 --> 01:18:59.710]  limited.
[01:18:59.790 --> 01:19:02.470]  It's the good old fashioned farmer
[01:19:02.550 --> 01:19:04.910]  life where you got to try trial and
[01:19:04.990 --> 01:19:06.350]  error stuff.
[01:19:06.430 --> 01:19:08.110]  I mean I've probably killed in the
[01:19:08.190 --> 01:19:13.070]  realms of 50 plants over the years
[01:19:13.150 --> 01:19:16.350]  you know from from just trial and error
[01:19:16.430 --> 01:19:18.550]  like oh this house plant could use some
[01:19:18.630 --> 01:19:21.190]  nutrients and spray them boom dead.
[01:19:21.270 --> 01:19:23.350]  You know I killed a 30 year old bamboo
[01:19:23.430 --> 01:19:24.150]  tree.
[01:19:24.230 --> 01:19:26.630]  I thought for sure that I mean this
[01:19:26.630 --> 01:19:29.590]  thing was like eight foot tall and
[01:19:29.670 --> 01:19:31.670]  bamboo so high in silica.
[01:19:31.750 --> 01:19:36.430]  I was like oh man if you if I feed this
[01:19:36.510 --> 01:19:40.550]  bamboo tree some a fermented plant
[01:19:40.630 --> 01:19:43.190]  juice of horsetail which is really high
[01:19:43.270 --> 01:19:46.070]  in silica like it can only benefit.
[01:19:46.150 --> 01:19:48.350]  So you know I sprayed it and then like
[01:19:48.430 --> 01:19:51.150]  three weeks later I sprayed it again
[01:19:51.230 --> 01:19:52.550]  and then like three weeks later I
[01:19:52.630 --> 01:19:54.550]  sprayed it again and by that point I
[01:19:54.550 --> 01:19:56.550]  realized something was wrong.
[01:19:56.630 --> 01:19:58.870]  And and then about a month later that
[01:19:58.950 --> 01:20:03.310]  whole and tired tree died.
[01:20:03.390 --> 01:20:06.150]  So it's not I mean these these growth
[01:20:06.230 --> 01:20:09.110]  styles aren't you know filled with 100
[01:20:09.190 --> 01:20:12.070]  percent success.
[01:20:12.150 --> 01:20:16.230]  There there's there's a lot to to learn
[01:20:16.310 --> 01:20:19.190]  and dial in but man I got branched off
[01:20:19.270 --> 01:20:21.670]  from the direction I was going with that.
[01:20:21.830 --> 01:20:25.110]  So I'll I'll bring you back in.
[01:20:25.190 --> 01:20:27.430]  Did you fuck with the dilution or or you
[01:20:27.510 --> 01:20:29.750]  think it was just the amount of
[01:20:29.830 --> 01:20:32.230]  repetitive applications that took that
[01:20:32.310 --> 01:20:34.310]  tree out.
[01:20:34.390 --> 01:20:37.750]  It was is definitely dilution for one.
[01:20:37.830 --> 01:20:41.270]  You know I was doing the the recommended
[01:20:41.350 --> 01:20:44.870]  strength
[01:20:44.950 --> 01:20:46.870]  and it ended up turning out to be too
[01:20:46.950 --> 01:20:49.030]  much.
[01:20:49.030 --> 01:20:51.910]  And you know a lot of these a lot of
[01:20:51.990 --> 01:20:53.910]  these nutrients and stuff when we're
[01:20:53.990 --> 01:20:55.910]  talking about like everyday
[01:20:55.990 --> 01:20:58.550]  eating crops and you know you might only
[01:20:58.630 --> 01:21:01.030]  treat something with nitrogen
[01:21:01.110 --> 01:21:05.510]  you know once or twice a season.
[01:21:05.590 --> 01:21:08.470]  Like my raspberries man if you hit those
[01:21:08.550 --> 01:21:10.870]  rasp those first year canes with some
[01:21:10.950 --> 01:21:12.070]  nitrogen
[01:21:12.150 --> 01:21:14.390]  those suckers will grow six foot tall
[01:21:14.470 --> 01:21:17.270]  and have one foot satellite branches
[01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:19.830]  going into the following season and the
[01:21:19.910 --> 01:21:21.110]  production will
[01:21:21.190 --> 01:21:24.710]  be increased by a ton. Whereas like
[01:21:24.790 --> 01:21:27.110]  cannabis man it eats a lot.
[01:21:27.190 --> 01:21:29.910]  So like I'm what I'm feeding every
[01:21:29.990 --> 01:21:31.830]  single week.
[01:21:31.910 --> 01:21:33.910]  Sometimes twice a week like I'm growing
[01:21:33.990 --> 01:21:36.310]  some very nutrient demanding crops right
[01:21:36.390 --> 01:21:38.470]  now like the sour diesel.
[01:21:38.550 --> 01:21:41.670]  And man that thing can take some
[01:21:41.750 --> 01:21:45.110]  calcium and magnesium. Like you know I'm
[01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:47.430]  having to feed full strength two to
[01:21:47.510 --> 01:21:48.870]  three times a week.
[01:21:48.950 --> 01:21:52.310]  Which is way more than anyone would ever
[01:21:52.390 --> 01:21:55.270]  recommend with K&F.
[01:21:55.350 --> 01:21:57.830]  It's a tough it's kind of a tough oh I
[01:21:57.910 --> 01:21:59.350]  remember where I was going.
[01:21:59.430 --> 01:22:01.670]  It's a tough road to navigate and kind
[01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:03.670]  of learn how to use. And
[01:22:03.750 --> 01:22:05.190]  like I said it's been fraught with
[01:22:05.270 --> 01:22:07.670]  failure and learning experiences.
[01:22:07.670 --> 01:22:09.590]  But most people are set up in their
[01:22:09.670 --> 01:22:11.670]  growth styles. I mean most people
[01:22:11.750 --> 01:22:14.230]  have their living soil beds. They're
[01:22:14.230 --> 01:22:16.870]  doing super soil pots.
[01:22:16.950 --> 01:22:19.190]  And this is where I see a lot of people
[01:22:19.270 --> 01:22:21.590]  being able to benefit from this K&F
[01:22:21.670 --> 01:22:22.790]  style without going
[01:22:22.870 --> 01:22:25.750]  full bore into it. Is you know maybe
[01:22:25.830 --> 01:22:26.870]  having a
[01:22:26.950 --> 01:22:30.470]  calcium input. Maybe having the nitrogen.
[01:22:30.550 --> 01:22:33.110]  Maybe having the phosphorus or even the
[01:22:33.190 --> 01:22:34.710]  potassium input.
[01:22:34.790 --> 01:22:36.790]  And then just having them on the
[01:22:36.870 --> 01:22:39.350]  shelf for when you start to develop
[01:22:39.430 --> 01:22:41.030]  deficiencies.
[01:22:41.110 --> 01:22:43.830]  Your soil maybe you start to
[01:22:43.830 --> 01:22:46.710]  run in run short of you know
[01:22:46.790 --> 01:22:49.110]  of you know let's say calcium in your
[01:22:49.190 --> 01:22:51.030]  in your soil. You started to use it all
[01:22:51.030 --> 01:22:51.590]  up.
[01:22:51.670 --> 01:22:53.910]  Well you know yeah you could apply some
[01:22:53.910 --> 01:22:55.830]  more gypsum. It's going to take two weeks
[01:22:55.910 --> 01:22:57.350]  to start to break down.
[01:22:57.350 --> 01:22:59.670]  You can just go ahead and foliar some
[01:22:59.670 --> 01:23:01.190]  WCA
[01:23:01.190 --> 01:23:04.310]  and correct that problem right away
[01:23:04.390 --> 01:23:08.550]  as that nutrition starting to break down.
[01:23:08.550 --> 01:23:11.350]  So that's where I really see a lot of
[01:23:11.350 --> 01:23:15.350]  this community benefiting
[01:23:15.430 --> 01:23:18.550]  from this grow style.
[01:23:18.630 --> 01:23:20.470]  All right there is a question here. How
[01:23:20.470 --> 01:23:22.470]  often do you foliar your spray?
[01:23:22.470 --> 01:23:26.070]  And my warning to Robert is be careful.
[01:23:26.150 --> 01:23:28.230]  You are directly affecting the plant
[01:23:28.230 --> 01:23:29.830]  with foliar applications. But
[01:23:29.830 --> 01:23:31.510]  maybe you can speak on that a
[01:23:31.510 --> 01:23:32.950]  little my friend.
[01:23:32.950 --> 01:23:35.590]  Yeah. Yeah if you're if you don't
[01:23:35.590 --> 01:23:37.350]  have any nutrients in the soil. If
[01:23:37.350 --> 01:23:38.710]  you're running a sterile
[01:23:38.870 --> 01:23:43.830]  sterile soil or minimal nutrients I mean
[01:23:43.830 --> 01:23:45.990]  and you're doing a cannabis crop then
[01:23:45.990 --> 01:23:49.590]  you're going to want to do once a week.
[01:23:50.470 --> 01:23:53.590]  So if you're if you have a nice full
[01:23:53.590 --> 01:23:56.070]  well-rounded soil that's full of
[01:23:56.070 --> 01:23:59.430]  nutrition you know
[01:23:59.430 --> 01:24:02.070]  maybe maybe you only need to do it once
[01:24:02.070 --> 01:24:04.470]  a month.
[01:24:04.710 --> 01:24:06.630]  So there you go. That was a great way of
[01:24:06.630 --> 01:24:07.670]  answering that question.
[01:24:07.670 --> 01:24:09.430]  It depends on what you got. And this
[01:24:09.430 --> 01:24:11.110]  goes back to why I tell people you've
[01:24:11.110 --> 01:24:12.470]  got to test man.
[01:24:12.470 --> 01:24:14.310]  You don't test your soil. You have no
[01:24:14.310 --> 01:24:16.230]  idea what the fuck is in there.
[01:24:16.230 --> 01:24:18.150]  And you know if it's if you're relying
[01:24:18.150 --> 01:24:20.470]  on a super soil mix and biology to break
[01:24:20.470 --> 01:24:21.430]  it down
[01:24:21.430 --> 01:24:24.550]  and you don't have a certain mineral
[01:24:24.550 --> 01:24:26.390]  the biology can't break it down can't
[01:24:26.390 --> 01:24:27.350]  make it up people.
[01:24:27.350 --> 01:24:29.270]  So you know this this is why it's so
[01:24:29.270 --> 01:24:30.470]  important to have
[01:24:30.470 --> 01:24:32.950]  at least a basic understanding of what
[01:24:32.950 --> 01:24:34.390]  you started with
[01:24:34.390 --> 01:24:36.870]  and then what you finished with. And then
[01:24:36.870 --> 01:24:37.910]  like he said
[01:24:37.910 --> 01:24:41.110]  this is a great way to hit deficiencies
[01:24:41.110 --> 01:24:44.710]  or or unlock nutrients very quickly
[01:24:44.710 --> 01:24:46.470]  while you're waiting for what you just
[01:24:46.470 --> 01:24:48.550]  amended to kick in.
[01:24:48.550 --> 01:24:51.110]  And Julian yes absolutely if your parts
[01:24:51.110 --> 01:24:53.350]  per million are over 50
[01:24:53.350 --> 01:24:55.430]  you will have a disassociation with the
[01:24:55.430 --> 01:24:57.270]  mycorrhizae. The mycorrhizae will
[01:24:57.270 --> 01:24:58.390]  actually become
[01:24:58.390 --> 01:25:00.790]  pathogenic. In other words it'll take
[01:25:00.790 --> 01:25:02.150]  sugars from the plant
[01:25:02.150 --> 01:25:05.350]  but will not return phosphorus back. So
[01:25:05.590 --> 01:25:07.990]  this again is why it's a great way to
[01:25:07.990 --> 01:25:09.750]  use the phosphorus
[01:25:09.750 --> 01:25:12.310]  on a foliar application which will not
[01:25:12.310 --> 01:25:13.590]  affect
[01:25:13.590 --> 01:25:15.990]  the relationship between the mycorrhizae
[01:25:15.990 --> 01:25:17.430]  and the plant as long as you're not
[01:25:17.430 --> 01:25:20.470]  over foliar and dripping it all down
[01:25:20.470 --> 01:25:21.830]  into the soil.
[01:25:21.830 --> 01:25:23.110]  Sorry to interrupt you on that brother
[01:25:23.110 --> 01:25:24.470]  I'm just trying to kill you.
[01:25:24.470 --> 01:25:27.830]  No I appreciate that.
[01:25:27.830 --> 01:25:33.670]  Yeah so we've talked about
[01:25:34.470 --> 01:25:37.030]  some nitrogen through the form of
[01:25:37.030 --> 01:25:40.790]  fish amino acids. We talked about the
[01:25:40.790 --> 01:25:43.350]  water soluble calcium phosphate which is
[01:25:43.350 --> 01:25:43.990]  made from
[01:25:43.990 --> 01:25:47.590]  bones. We also have
[01:25:47.590 --> 01:25:50.390]  WSK which is called water soluble
[01:25:50.390 --> 01:25:51.750]  potassium.
[01:25:51.750 --> 01:25:55.510]  And we make this from
[01:25:55.510 --> 01:25:58.550]  from biocharged sunflower stalks and
[01:25:58.550 --> 01:26:00.230]  heads
[01:26:00.230 --> 01:26:05.030]  as well as tobacco stalks and stems. I
[01:26:05.030 --> 01:26:06.310]  guess it depends which part of the
[01:26:06.310 --> 01:26:08.310]  country you live in. You might have one
[01:26:08.310 --> 01:26:11.350]  access to one
[01:26:11.350 --> 01:26:14.630]  a little easier than the other.
[01:26:14.630 --> 01:26:17.670]  But sunflowers are really cool. I grow a
[01:26:17.670 --> 01:26:19.590]  bunch every year. I grow
[01:26:19.590 --> 01:26:22.630]  the giant ones and I feed a bunch
[01:26:22.630 --> 01:26:24.950]  of langbenite into the soil. But
[01:26:24.950 --> 01:26:27.350]  sunflowers accumulate a bunch of
[01:26:27.350 --> 01:26:29.590]  potassium in their flesh.
[01:26:29.590 --> 01:26:32.230]  And throughout the growing season I just
[01:26:32.230 --> 01:26:33.350]  make sure they
[01:26:33.350 --> 01:26:35.350]  got plenty of potassium in the soil
[01:26:35.350 --> 01:26:37.670]  and then they uptake it into their flesh.
[01:26:37.670 --> 01:26:39.590]  And at the end of the season I biochar
[01:26:39.590 --> 01:26:41.430]  it in a dutch oven
[01:26:41.430 --> 01:26:44.710]  over some coals and then put
[01:26:44.710 --> 01:26:48.150]  1 tenth charred stalks and heads
[01:26:48.150 --> 01:26:51.190]  to 10 parts water. And it's just a simple
[01:26:51.190 --> 01:26:52.870]  water extraction.
[01:26:52.870 --> 01:26:55.190]  And the water pulls out all the potassium
[01:26:55.190 --> 01:26:56.310]  into solution
[01:26:56.310 --> 01:26:59.510]  and then you have a plant available
[01:26:59.510 --> 01:27:01.750]  potassium source.
[01:27:01.750 --> 01:27:04.710]  So that one's nice to have around and a
[01:27:04.710 --> 01:27:06.070]  lot of people are just growing their
[01:27:06.070 --> 01:27:08.070]  sunflowers in their yard and
[01:27:08.070 --> 01:27:09.830]  and don't even know what to do with them.
[01:27:09.830 --> 01:27:11.990]  I mean the stalks
[01:27:11.990 --> 01:27:14.150]  turn them into a potassium source for
[01:27:14.150 --> 01:27:15.670]  your
[01:27:15.670 --> 01:27:21.620]  for your plants.
[01:27:21.620 --> 01:27:22.980]  You know I just wanted to hit on
[01:27:22.980 --> 01:27:24.420]  something.
[01:27:24.420 --> 01:27:27.140]  Dean Family Farms. All right, just so you
[01:27:27.140 --> 01:27:28.420]  completely understand
[01:27:28.420 --> 01:27:32.180]  there can be nutrients in the soil
[01:27:32.180 --> 01:27:34.900]  that the plant has access to but can't
[01:27:34.900 --> 01:27:36.180]  pull up due to
[01:27:36.180 --> 01:27:39.380]  lack of proper biology. So that's why
[01:27:39.380 --> 01:27:41.060]  it's important to do both soil
[01:27:41.060 --> 01:27:43.940]  and plant tissue if you can afford to.
[01:27:43.940 --> 01:27:45.540]  Because that'll tell you both what's in
[01:27:45.540 --> 01:27:46.580]  the soil,
[01:27:46.580 --> 01:27:48.900]  what the plant's uptaking. If that's way
[01:27:48.900 --> 01:27:50.180]  out of balance
[01:27:50.180 --> 01:27:51.540]  then now you know you've got a
[01:27:51.540 --> 01:27:53.140]  biological issue. You need to get some
[01:27:53.140 --> 01:27:54.580]  good biology.
[01:27:54.580 --> 01:27:56.980]  And here again something you touched on
[01:27:57.140 --> 01:27:58.340]  earlier about
[01:27:58.340 --> 01:28:01.220]  mammoth pea. So you know I preach this
[01:28:01.220 --> 01:28:02.660]  to people and they really got to start
[01:28:02.660 --> 01:28:03.620]  to understand this.
[01:28:03.620 --> 01:28:07.380]  If you're growing out microbes in a lab
[01:28:07.380 --> 01:28:09.060]  they are not going to be nearly as
[01:28:09.060 --> 01:28:10.100]  hardy
[01:28:10.100 --> 01:28:13.380]  as if you get them in nature, in vivo it's
[01:28:13.380 --> 01:28:14.260]  called.
[01:28:14.260 --> 01:28:15.940]  That's why I love fish brood because
[01:28:15.940 --> 01:28:17.940]  you're getting all these organisms that
[01:28:17.940 --> 01:28:20.260]  are grown in nature and you're getting
[01:28:20.260 --> 01:28:23.140]  not just five types of phosphate
[01:28:23.140 --> 01:28:24.820]  solubilizing bacteria,
[01:28:24.820 --> 01:28:27.060]  you're getting millions or thousands of
[01:28:27.060 --> 01:28:28.020]  different types.
[01:28:28.020 --> 01:28:29.700]  And they all will function
[01:28:29.700 --> 01:28:32.100]  differently and some of them will be,
[01:28:32.100 --> 01:28:33.300]  some of them will turn into
[01:28:33.300 --> 01:28:35.380]  biostimulant but others will probably
[01:28:35.380 --> 01:28:37.060]  turn into bioinoculants. In other words
[01:28:37.060 --> 01:28:38.660]  they will survive.
[01:28:38.660 --> 01:28:42.260]  So definitely keep that in mind people.
[01:28:42.260 --> 01:28:45.300]  Sorry I didn't mean to rant.
[01:28:45.300 --> 01:28:48.100]  Love it. So another cool resource that
[01:28:48.100 --> 01:28:49.460]  people can use to
[01:28:49.460 --> 01:28:53.060]  look this stuff up and I think I learned
[01:28:53.060 --> 01:28:53.940]  this from
[01:28:53.940 --> 01:28:57.620]  Steven Reisner but there's this really
[01:28:57.620 --> 01:28:59.940]  cool resource online called the Dr.
[01:28:59.940 --> 01:29:03.540]  Duke's Phytochemical and Ethnobotanical
[01:29:03.540 --> 01:29:08.820]  Database and it has essentially,
[01:29:08.820 --> 01:29:10.660]  I mean every plant that I've ever needed
[01:29:10.660 --> 01:29:12.580]  to look up, it has their
[01:29:12.580 --> 01:29:16.100]  their nutrient and mineral breakdown of
[01:29:16.100 --> 01:29:19.140]  basically what that plant contains.
[01:29:19.140 --> 01:29:21.940]  You know as we already stated the plant
[01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:24.420]  is only as nutrient dense as what's in
[01:29:24.420 --> 01:29:25.780]  the soil.
[01:29:25.780 --> 01:29:27.860]  So where they took a lot of their tests
[01:29:27.860 --> 01:29:29.380]  you know it might be different than what
[01:29:29.380 --> 01:29:30.100]  you have
[01:29:30.100 --> 01:29:32.740]  or what you harvested but it'll give you
[01:29:32.740 --> 01:29:34.420]  a good starting ground.
[01:29:34.420 --> 01:29:36.980]  That way you know what whatever you're
[01:29:36.980 --> 01:29:38.580]  fermenting you can get an
[01:29:38.580 --> 01:29:42.340]  idea of what kind of nutrition that
[01:29:42.340 --> 01:29:44.980]  plant contains that is now locked within
[01:29:44.980 --> 01:29:46.180]  your ferment.
[01:29:46.180 --> 01:29:47.860]  That'll give you an idea what you're
[01:29:47.860 --> 01:29:49.380]  feeding your plants, what they're
[01:29:49.420 --> 01:29:52.740]  uptaking. So that's a really great
[01:29:52.740 --> 01:29:55.140]  resource and it's got tons of
[01:29:55.140 --> 01:29:56.260]  information.
[01:29:56.260 --> 01:29:59.700]  So that was Dr. Duke's
[01:29:59.700 --> 01:30:03.700]  Phytochemical and Ethnobotanical
[01:30:03.700 --> 01:30:06.340]  Database. You know if you probably just
[01:30:06.340 --> 01:30:07.140]  tried
[01:30:07.140 --> 01:30:10.180]  Dr. Duke's Database it will probably
[01:30:10.180 --> 01:30:12.820]  pop up.
[01:30:12.820 --> 01:30:15.140]  I wish we had Peter in the background. We
[01:30:15.140 --> 01:30:17.220]  got to teach you how to do this Ken.
[01:30:17.700 --> 01:30:22.020]  I know my internet's so slow it takes me
[01:30:22.020 --> 01:30:24.340]  about five minutes to load a page.
[01:30:24.340 --> 01:30:27.220]  That's part of the problem right?
[01:30:27.220 --> 01:30:29.220]  Got you. So when you do get it loaded
[01:30:29.220 --> 01:30:31.380]  pop it into the chat if you can.
[01:30:31.380 --> 01:30:34.580]  Okay. I'm gonna type it into the
[01:30:34.580 --> 01:30:37.140]  chat right now.
[01:30:37.140 --> 01:30:38.900]  See now there is a brother helping a
[01:30:38.900 --> 01:30:41.940]  brother out you know.
[01:30:44.260 --> 01:30:45.940]  You know sitting beside me because she
[01:30:45.940 --> 01:30:49.140]  types a lot faster.
[01:30:51.300 --> 01:30:53.860]  And by the way my friend you're
[01:30:53.860 --> 01:30:55.380]  absolutely amazing
[01:30:55.380 --> 01:30:58.260]  and I want to thank you. I am personally
[01:30:58.260 --> 01:30:58.980]  learning
[01:30:58.980 --> 01:31:01.940]  a shit ton from today's show and
[01:31:01.940 --> 01:31:04.820]  all I can do is say thank you.
[01:31:04.820 --> 01:31:06.740]  Oh man heck yeah this is fun. I like
[01:31:06.740 --> 01:31:10.420]  chatting with you guys about this stuff.
[01:31:10.740 --> 01:31:12.980]  Well something that the community wants
[01:31:12.980 --> 01:31:14.420]  to chat with you about is
[01:31:14.420 --> 01:31:17.620]  when you went out hunting or
[01:31:17.620 --> 01:31:21.220]  when you were out did you choose to go
[01:31:21.220 --> 01:31:22.980]  bear hunting or that just came across
[01:31:22.980 --> 01:31:24.820]  you and you
[01:31:24.820 --> 01:31:28.260]  and you took it out? No we
[01:31:28.260 --> 01:31:30.100]  we were out there bear hunting. We were
[01:31:30.100 --> 01:31:31.700]  on a bait site so
[01:31:31.700 --> 01:31:35.220]  my buddy sets up this bait site
[01:31:35.220 --> 01:31:37.860]  hauls out a whole bunch of stuff from
[01:31:37.860 --> 01:31:40.740]  April 15th to like May 15th and
[01:31:40.740 --> 01:31:42.980]  and sets up this site puts a couple
[01:31:42.980 --> 01:31:44.900]  tree stands out there and
[01:31:44.900 --> 01:31:46.900]  and then restocks the site with
[01:31:46.900 --> 01:31:48.660]  bait and
[01:31:48.660 --> 01:31:50.420]  and if you get an early spring black
[01:31:50.420 --> 01:31:51.380]  bear
[01:31:51.380 --> 01:31:54.740]  we turn most of that actually all that
[01:31:54.740 --> 01:31:55.460]  meat into
[01:31:55.460 --> 01:31:58.340]  sausage and hamburger and and mix it
[01:31:58.340 --> 01:31:59.860]  with some pork fat and
[01:31:59.860 --> 01:32:02.340]  and I'll tell you what it's just as good
[01:32:02.340 --> 01:32:03.940]  as any beef hamburger you're going to
[01:32:03.940 --> 01:32:04.820]  get but it's
[01:32:04.820 --> 01:32:08.740]  way cleaner bear power.
[01:32:08.740 --> 01:32:10.900]  So it's not gamey because you're
[01:32:10.900 --> 01:32:12.500]  cutting it with other things or because
[01:32:12.580 --> 01:32:14.980]  it's spring?
[01:32:14.980 --> 01:32:18.180]  Because it's spring you know
[01:32:18.180 --> 01:32:21.780]  if you were to get that bear maybe
[01:32:21.780 --> 01:32:26.980]  mid July early August those bears diets
[01:32:26.980 --> 01:32:29.060]  have changed and they've just been eating
[01:32:29.060 --> 01:32:30.340]  salmon
[01:32:30.340 --> 01:32:33.700]  and then you'll get a real gamey
[01:32:33.700 --> 01:32:37.220]  I mean even to the point sometimes
[01:32:37.220 --> 01:32:38.420]  where it just
[01:32:38.420 --> 01:32:41.460]  you know stinks. People don't often
[01:32:42.420 --> 01:32:44.820]  I'm not really into I'm into hunting
[01:32:44.820 --> 01:32:46.260]  hunting for food.
[01:32:46.260 --> 01:32:47.940]  I don't care about the hides or
[01:32:47.940 --> 01:32:50.420]  anything really but a lot of people
[01:32:50.420 --> 01:32:52.820]  around here you know they they want the
[01:32:52.820 --> 01:32:54.180]  bear hide or
[01:32:54.180 --> 01:32:57.140]  or the head or whatever and they'll
[01:32:57.140 --> 01:32:57.860]  they'll
[01:32:57.860 --> 01:33:00.580]  shoot a mere round but but that
[01:33:00.580 --> 01:33:01.540]  gaminess
[01:33:01.540 --> 01:33:05.060]  it happens from maybe like
[01:33:05.060 --> 01:33:07.620]  not taking care of the meat properly
[01:33:07.620 --> 01:33:08.900]  post harvest
[01:33:08.900 --> 01:33:11.380]  time of year that it's harvested and
[01:33:12.020 --> 01:33:14.580]  I bet that the pork does
[01:33:14.580 --> 01:33:19.540]  play some some kind of
[01:33:19.540 --> 01:33:21.700]  job and really making that that meat
[01:33:21.700 --> 01:33:24.500]  much more enjoyable because you know
[01:33:24.500 --> 01:33:27.780]  pork fat's amazing.
[01:33:27.780 --> 01:33:30.500]  So you know like when you're hunting a
[01:33:30.500 --> 01:33:32.020]  bear I mean I don't think most people
[01:33:32.020 --> 01:33:34.020]  have obviously experienced that so
[01:33:34.020 --> 01:33:36.740]  it's it's set up with like a bait then
[01:33:36.740 --> 01:33:38.820]  does it clamp down like a mouse trap or
[01:33:38.820 --> 01:33:40.260]  something like that and then you finish
[01:33:40.260 --> 01:33:41.460]  it off or?
[01:33:41.460 --> 01:33:44.100]  No so you got say you got two 55 gallon
[01:33:44.100 --> 01:33:46.820]  drums and you cut a six by six hole in
[01:33:46.820 --> 01:33:48.020]  the side.
[01:33:48.020 --> 01:33:51.060]  So it's small enough that you can fill
[01:33:51.060 --> 01:33:53.780]  it up so we're using stuff like
[01:33:53.780 --> 01:33:56.500]  you know we'll go to the local feed
[01:33:56.500 --> 01:33:58.420]  shops and buy like you know the
[01:33:58.420 --> 01:34:01.780]  the oats, cracked corn, barley
[01:34:01.780 --> 01:34:04.980]  kind of stuff you know the the
[01:34:04.980 --> 01:34:06.820]  the sacks of feed that you get to feed
[01:34:06.820 --> 01:34:08.820]  your horses and pigs and
[01:34:09.460 --> 01:34:12.100]  and buy those kind of sacks and then
[01:34:12.100 --> 01:34:16.260]  also bags of dog food and then you know
[01:34:16.260 --> 01:34:19.620]  mix all that up with you know like maybe
[01:34:19.620 --> 01:34:22.740]  some grease from the restaurants or
[01:34:22.740 --> 01:34:24.500]  whatever they're getting rid of.
[01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:27.300]  So then you pack these 55 gallon drums
[01:34:27.300 --> 01:34:31.300]  with the with the bait and
[01:34:31.300 --> 01:34:33.380]  so this is one method for hunting bear
[01:34:33.380 --> 01:34:34.900]  it's a bait site you know you just kind
[01:34:34.900 --> 01:34:36.340]  of sit there and wait for them to come
[01:34:36.340 --> 01:34:37.140]  in and
[01:34:37.140 --> 01:34:39.300]  there's also spot and stalk you know
[01:34:39.300 --> 01:34:41.380]  you're you're out and about and
[01:34:41.380 --> 01:34:44.500]  and you see a bear and and stalk it and
[01:34:44.500 --> 01:34:46.580]  that's that's another method.
[01:34:46.580 --> 01:34:49.540]  But yeah these bears they come
[01:34:49.540 --> 01:34:51.700]  into the bait site and they just kind of
[01:34:51.700 --> 01:34:53.620]  reach their paws in through the little
[01:34:53.620 --> 01:34:56.420]  hole and like pull it out and and feed
[01:34:56.420 --> 01:34:58.020]  themselves
[01:34:58.020 --> 01:35:00.740]  and eventually you know they start to
[01:35:00.740 --> 01:35:02.420]  get comfortable with the site and
[01:35:02.420 --> 01:35:04.660]  they'll keep coming back and you know we
[01:35:04.660 --> 01:35:08.260]  have lives so you pop out there you know
[01:35:08.260 --> 01:35:11.140]  once a week or whatever and whenever you
[01:35:11.140 --> 01:35:12.500]  can get out there and
[01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:14.740]  check your game cams and see what kind
[01:35:14.740 --> 01:35:17.620]  of stuff has been coming into the site
[01:35:17.620 --> 01:35:18.100]  and
[01:35:18.100 --> 01:35:19.220]  you know you're scrolling through
[01:35:19.220 --> 01:35:21.300]  pictures and you're like oh well there's
[01:35:21.300 --> 01:35:23.060]  three big grizzlies and
[01:35:23.060 --> 01:35:24.900]  oh there's two black bears and you're
[01:35:24.900 --> 01:35:26.820]  like well you know that bears have been
[01:35:26.820 --> 01:35:28.100]  to the site.
[01:35:28.100 --> 01:35:30.260]  So you get up in your tree stand you sit
[01:35:30.260 --> 01:35:32.660]  there quiet and you don't make a peep.
[01:35:32.660 --> 01:35:36.420]  I mean mosquitoes so thick
[01:35:36.420 --> 01:35:40.020]  that you can't even really
[01:35:40.020 --> 01:35:41.620]  it's hard to live with it you need a
[01:35:41.620 --> 01:35:44.340]  whole mosquito screen over your face
[01:35:44.340 --> 01:35:46.420]  you need gloves so your hands aren't
[01:35:46.420 --> 01:35:48.740]  exposed and and you're just getting
[01:35:48.740 --> 01:35:52.420]  swarmed the whole time sitting there
[01:35:52.420 --> 01:35:56.180]  super quiet waiting for these animals to
[01:35:56.180 --> 01:35:57.220]  come strolling
[01:35:57.220 --> 01:36:00.820]  into the site. Don't forget the black
[01:36:00.900 --> 01:36:03.700]  flies my friend don't forget the black
[01:36:03.700 --> 01:36:04.260]  flies
[01:36:04.260 --> 01:36:06.180]  you just don't open your mouth when
[01:36:06.180 --> 01:36:08.260]  you're walking outside is what I found
[01:36:08.260 --> 01:36:10.660]  up north.
[01:36:10.660 --> 01:36:14.420]  Can't bears climb trees? Yeah.
[01:36:14.420 --> 01:36:17.460]  So how the hell like I mean it's
[01:36:17.460 --> 01:36:20.340]  it's a very interesting animal to hunt
[01:36:20.340 --> 01:36:21.780]  man when you're out there like getting
[01:36:21.780 --> 01:36:23.060]  all this stuff.
[01:36:23.060 --> 01:36:25.700]  So it's very intriguing to me and the
[01:36:25.700 --> 01:36:26.740]  audience as well
[01:36:26.740 --> 01:36:28.500]  of like so you know you're sitting in
[01:36:28.500 --> 01:36:30.020]  the deer stand but sometimes you got to
[01:36:30.020 --> 01:36:31.700]  get to the deer stand so how do you know
[01:36:31.700 --> 01:36:33.300]  there's not a bear in the area while
[01:36:33.300 --> 01:36:35.140]  you're walking up to the
[01:36:35.140 --> 01:36:38.020]  to the feeding zone. Well bears
[01:36:38.020 --> 01:36:40.180]  generally get scared off you know they're
[01:36:40.180 --> 01:36:42.180]  there they hear you come in before you
[01:36:42.180 --> 01:36:44.420]  hear them and then they're gone.
[01:36:44.420 --> 01:36:48.020]  The only kind of real real bear attacks
[01:36:48.020 --> 01:36:50.420]  you're seeing are when you know people
[01:36:50.420 --> 01:36:51.620]  are stumbling upon
[01:36:51.620 --> 01:36:55.780]  a mom and a cub or something like that.
[01:36:55.780 --> 01:36:57.940]  So generally you're not going to see a
[01:36:57.940 --> 01:36:59.060]  bear out in
[01:36:59.060 --> 01:37:01.460]  and you know the wild when you're
[01:37:01.460 --> 01:37:03.380]  walking around if you're making enough
[01:37:03.380 --> 01:37:04.020]  noise
[01:37:04.020 --> 01:37:05.540]  because they hear you coming and they
[01:37:05.540 --> 01:37:07.460]  get off the trail they're gone.
[01:37:07.460 --> 01:37:10.180]  If you do stumble upon something like
[01:37:10.180 --> 01:37:12.580]  that well that's what the 44 magnum's
[01:37:12.580 --> 01:37:13.700]  for.
[01:37:13.700 --> 01:37:17.220]  And you know once you're in the
[01:37:17.220 --> 01:37:17.860]  tree
[01:37:17.860 --> 01:37:20.740]  then you know you got your your hunting
[01:37:20.740 --> 01:37:22.180]  rifle.
[01:37:22.180 --> 01:37:26.740]  And so there's really no fear
[01:37:26.740 --> 01:37:29.780]  of something like that happening.
[01:37:29.780 --> 01:37:31.860]  The sketchiest part is after you got a
[01:37:31.860 --> 01:37:34.100]  bear down and you're processing this
[01:37:34.100 --> 01:37:35.060]  bear
[01:37:35.060 --> 01:37:37.700]  and would be like and you're focused on
[01:37:37.700 --> 01:37:39.540]  that would be like another bear
[01:37:39.540 --> 01:37:42.100]  wandering into the bait site while
[01:37:42.100 --> 01:37:45.220]  you're down there processing this bear.
[01:37:45.220 --> 01:37:47.300]  But you just got to stay on your toes
[01:37:47.300 --> 01:37:49.860]  and you have your sidearm and if
[01:37:49.860 --> 01:37:52.260]  if it came to that you could you know
[01:37:52.260 --> 01:37:53.220]  use it to
[01:37:53.220 --> 01:37:56.500]  to you know defend yourself
[01:37:56.500 --> 01:38:00.100]  or whatever. So moose hunting is
[01:38:00.100 --> 01:38:02.180]  or bear hunting's in the spring to get
[01:38:02.180 --> 01:38:04.340]  the best quality and then
[01:38:04.340 --> 01:38:06.740]  the end last two weeks of September is
[01:38:06.740 --> 01:38:09.060]  when moose season starts popping off
[01:38:09.060 --> 01:38:11.620]  around here and everyone's heading out
[01:38:11.620 --> 01:38:13.860]  into the woods to go get their
[01:38:13.860 --> 01:38:16.660]  go get their yearly moose their yearly
[01:38:16.660 --> 01:38:18.180]  bull.
[01:38:18.180 --> 01:38:20.500]  So
[01:38:20.980 --> 01:38:24.660]  just somebody made a comment yeah it's
[01:38:24.740 --> 01:38:26.740]  it's respect when you're out in the bush
[01:38:26.740 --> 01:38:28.020]  and you're hunting
[01:38:28.020 --> 01:38:30.820]  it's that respect. Go watch Avatar and
[01:38:30.820 --> 01:38:33.060]  see the respect they paid to the animal
[01:38:33.060 --> 01:38:34.100]  in that movie
[01:38:34.100 --> 01:38:35.860]  when they took its life. That's the
[01:38:35.860 --> 01:38:37.780]  respect we all need to have for the food
[01:38:37.780 --> 01:38:38.740]  we consume
[01:38:38.740 --> 01:38:41.460]  whether it's plant or animal.
[01:38:41.460 --> 01:38:43.780]  Yeah well I'll tell you what like those
[01:38:43.780 --> 01:38:45.540]  cows that are out in the field that are
[01:38:45.540 --> 01:38:46.900]  being fed
[01:38:46.900 --> 01:38:50.180]  grains that are that were sprayed with
[01:38:50.180 --> 01:38:52.980]  glyphosate and they're packed into these
[01:38:53.060 --> 01:38:56.820]  feed lots and you know that is
[01:38:56.820 --> 01:38:59.460]  there's way more respect in going out
[01:38:59.460 --> 01:39:01.940]  and hunting an animal that lived a great
[01:39:01.940 --> 01:39:03.060]  life
[01:39:03.060 --> 01:39:06.260]  a great wildlife and and harvesting this
[01:39:06.260 --> 01:39:10.260]  this healthy clean meat for your family
[01:39:10.260 --> 01:39:13.060]  than then getting an animal that was
[01:39:13.060 --> 01:39:15.780]  raised on a feed lot fed a shit diet
[01:39:15.780 --> 01:39:17.860]  didn't have a good life was killed in
[01:39:17.860 --> 01:39:19.380]  inhumane ways
[01:39:19.380 --> 01:39:21.060]  processed by people that don't care
[01:39:21.060 --> 01:39:22.900]  about the meat. We're out there giving
[01:39:23.140 --> 01:39:26.020]  thanks we're using the scraps where it's
[01:39:26.020 --> 01:39:28.180]  all respect.
[01:39:28.180 --> 01:39:31.220]  And let's be fair man uh killing a deer
[01:39:31.220 --> 01:39:32.580]  or something is a
[01:39:32.580 --> 01:39:34.580]  different experience than probably I've
[01:39:34.580 --> 01:39:35.540]  never hunted
[01:39:35.540 --> 01:39:37.300]  a bear but you're going out there
[01:39:37.300 --> 01:39:39.060]  killing an animal that could
[01:39:39.060 --> 01:39:41.780]  potentially kill you where with deers and
[01:39:41.780 --> 01:39:43.540]  some of the other game and stuff you
[01:39:43.540 --> 01:39:45.380]  know they usually just run off.
[01:39:45.380 --> 01:39:48.020]  So don't kid yourself man that deer if
[01:39:48.020 --> 01:39:49.620]  it hits you in the head with one of
[01:39:49.620 --> 01:39:52.020]  those hooves if it pisses you off man are
[01:39:52.020 --> 01:39:53.140]  you pissing off
[01:39:53.140 --> 01:39:55.380]  you're just I mean in like a deer stand
[01:39:55.380 --> 01:39:57.220]  you know when you're up there like you
[01:39:57.220 --> 01:39:58.020]  know
[01:39:58.020 --> 01:40:00.580]  I'm sure he feels relatively safe but
[01:40:00.580 --> 01:40:01.780]  you're still
[01:40:01.780 --> 01:40:03.780]  shooting at an animal that you missed
[01:40:03.780 --> 01:40:05.380]  potentially could climb up the tree and
[01:40:05.380 --> 01:40:06.580]  kill you where
[01:40:06.580 --> 01:40:08.500]  some of the other animals aren't exactly
[01:40:08.500 --> 01:40:10.020]  gonna do that man
[01:40:10.020 --> 01:40:12.660]  that's funny well you know another thing
[01:40:12.660 --> 01:40:14.500]  too is he brings up a point that
[01:40:14.500 --> 01:40:16.580]  a friend of mine has had to run into and
[01:40:16.580 --> 01:40:18.820]  that is after he harvested
[01:40:18.820 --> 01:40:21.540]  the meat that he hunted uh
[01:40:21.540 --> 01:40:23.700]  then the grizzlies were stalking his
[01:40:23.700 --> 01:40:26.180]  ass because he had all that food on his
[01:40:26.180 --> 01:40:27.380]  on his horse
[01:40:27.380 --> 01:40:29.700]  so yeah that Brian that's you know that's
[01:40:29.700 --> 01:40:30.900]  serious shit
[01:40:30.900 --> 01:40:33.540]  you know I could see how a really hungry
[01:40:33.540 --> 01:40:35.460]  grizzly would come after his ass because
[01:40:35.460 --> 01:40:36.740]  he had a whole bunch of
[01:40:36.740 --> 01:40:38.180]  you know processed meat that he's
[01:40:38.180 --> 01:40:41.140]  dragging back to the fucking house
[01:40:41.140 --> 01:40:42.900]  that's what I don't know if anybody
[01:40:42.900 --> 01:40:43.940]  knows
[01:40:43.940 --> 01:40:45.460]  knows the answer to this question but
[01:40:45.460 --> 01:40:47.940]  would uh like if that was a
[01:40:47.940 --> 01:40:49.700]  a bear's family member would they
[01:40:49.700 --> 01:40:51.140]  recognize that and then
[01:40:51.140 --> 01:40:53.860]  want to kill you does it work like that
[01:40:53.860 --> 01:40:56.420]  or are they more
[01:40:57.460 --> 01:41:01.060]  like you mean revenge
[01:41:01.700 --> 01:41:03.300]  so like with horses and stuff they
[01:41:03.300 --> 01:41:05.140]  actually have like a personality and I
[01:41:05.140 --> 01:41:06.820]  I've learned that you know if you're if
[01:41:06.820 --> 01:41:08.580]  you're out there doing stupid shit that
[01:41:08.580 --> 01:41:09.540]  they'll
[01:41:09.540 --> 01:41:11.460]  it's like they go and tell like the stud
[01:41:11.460 --> 01:41:12.820]  horse and all of a sudden
[01:41:12.820 --> 01:41:14.340]  you know the stud horse is running by
[01:41:14.340 --> 01:41:16.100]  like when you're an idiot uh
[01:41:16.100 --> 01:41:18.820]  cow tipping and stuff it seems like the
[01:41:18.820 --> 01:41:20.340]  you know the cows go to get like the
[01:41:20.340 --> 01:41:21.540]  alpha cow and they're like look
[01:41:21.540 --> 01:41:22.820]  motherfucker this is all
[01:41:22.820 --> 01:41:27.860]  alpha cow jesus I think all I love you
[01:41:27.860 --> 01:41:28.420]  brother
[01:41:28.420 --> 01:41:30.820]  thank you I need to get that off the
[01:41:30.820 --> 01:41:33.540]  alpha cow
[01:41:33.540 --> 01:41:37.140]  does that exist that's awesome
[01:41:37.140 --> 01:41:38.740]  I would think that all animals
[01:41:38.740 --> 01:41:41.140]  definitely know their family members and
[01:41:41.140 --> 01:41:43.220]  I can't imagine that you'd get stalked by
[01:41:43.220 --> 01:41:43.940]  a bear
[01:41:43.940 --> 01:41:47.300]  that was like oh man you you know
[01:41:47.300 --> 01:41:50.500]  uh you just killed my mom kind of thing
[01:41:50.500 --> 01:41:52.500]  they would know I'm sure they're sad
[01:41:52.500 --> 01:41:55.540]  life moves on it's the wild uh but I
[01:41:55.540 --> 01:41:57.220]  can't imagine you're gonna get stalked
[01:41:57.220 --> 01:41:58.820]  on the way out
[01:41:58.820 --> 01:42:01.220]  unless it's chris and and it's his
[01:42:01.220 --> 01:42:03.220]  squirrel in the tree watching him because
[01:42:03.220 --> 01:42:06.980]  that squirrel's gonna get him one day
[01:42:08.100 --> 01:42:11.700]  inside joke guys sorry squirrel
[01:42:11.700 --> 01:42:13.780]  guerrero who has a has an issue with the
[01:42:13.780 --> 01:42:14.580]  squirrel
[01:42:14.580 --> 01:42:17.140]  uh talks about it on the show and stuff
[01:42:17.140 --> 01:42:22.870]  so you guys check that out uh fcp2
[01:42:22.870 --> 01:42:25.590]  yeah do we have any other good uh k and
[01:42:25.590 --> 01:42:26.470]  f questions
[01:42:26.470 --> 01:42:28.390]  well okay so real quick then so you're
[01:42:28.390 --> 01:42:29.670]  choosing the bear you're killing the
[01:42:29.670 --> 01:42:31.270]  bear you got you got the bear
[01:42:31.270 --> 01:42:33.190]  so individuals want to know all right so
[01:42:33.190 --> 01:42:35.030]  how how much of uh
[01:42:35.030 --> 01:42:37.350]  resources is that is that not only of
[01:42:37.350 --> 01:42:39.030]  the meat but now you got the bones is
[01:42:39.030 --> 01:42:40.150]  that you know now you have
[01:42:40.150 --> 01:42:43.350]  years of of bones to actually sit there
[01:42:43.350 --> 01:42:45.430]  and make ferments from
[01:42:45.430 --> 01:42:48.070]  yeah this was a pretty big bear uh I
[01:42:48.070 --> 01:42:52.310]  think we ended up yielding uh probably
[01:42:52.310 --> 01:42:55.430]  80 pounds of meat off of it I mean this
[01:42:55.430 --> 01:42:58.390]  bear was probably 220 pounds or something
[01:42:58.390 --> 01:42:59.590]  like that
[01:42:59.590 --> 01:43:02.550]  um so yeah me and my buddy we split it
[01:43:02.550 --> 01:43:04.710]  we each got about 40 pounds of meat and
[01:43:04.710 --> 01:43:05.590]  then the
[01:43:05.590 --> 01:43:09.190]  the bones like I mean the those bones
[01:43:09.190 --> 01:43:10.310]  are gonna make
[01:43:10.310 --> 01:43:13.750]  so much calcium phosphate you only use
[01:43:13.750 --> 01:43:17.270]  one-tenth part bones to to vinegar
[01:43:17.270 --> 01:43:20.710]  so I mean when I'm making a court I may
[01:43:20.710 --> 01:43:22.550]  be using
[01:43:22.550 --> 01:43:27.190]  a half cup you know uh so it's gonna go
[01:43:27.190 --> 01:43:30.310]  a long way I got a pretty big stack of
[01:43:30.310 --> 01:43:31.030]  wrapped up
[01:43:31.030 --> 01:43:34.550]  uh bones in the freezer that as uh as I
[01:43:34.550 --> 01:43:36.950]  run out of calcium phosphate
[01:43:36.950 --> 01:43:39.990]  on my website or my own personal I'll
[01:43:39.990 --> 01:43:42.790]  just pull out another one and char it up
[01:43:42.790 --> 01:43:45.030]  and pop it in vinegar and within seven
[01:43:45.030 --> 01:43:46.710]  days I'll have
[01:43:46.710 --> 01:43:49.830]  more calcium phosphate
[01:43:49.830 --> 01:43:52.390]  hey what is your website dude you gotta
[01:43:52.390 --> 01:43:53.910]  start letting people know
[01:43:53.910 --> 01:43:57.590]  this I mean to have a calc how uh
[01:43:57.590 --> 01:43:59.590]  a prep that's that's coming from bare
[01:43:59.590 --> 01:44:00.710]  bones man
[01:44:00.710 --> 01:44:03.910]  talk about badass right
[01:44:03.910 --> 01:44:05.750]  especially his ass is going out there
[01:44:05.750 --> 01:44:07.510]  and killing it not just necessarily
[01:44:07.510 --> 01:44:09.270]  buying it you know I mean that's that's
[01:44:09.270 --> 01:44:11.350]  why I I'm so glad that you came on the
[01:44:11.350 --> 01:44:12.390]  show man

[01:44:22.950 --> 01:44:24.710]  going out and just killing a bear with a
[01:44:24.710 --> 01:44:25.590]  buddy
[01:44:25.590 --> 01:44:27.590]  would be pretty nerve wracking well I
[01:44:27.590 --> 01:44:29.430]  don't want to steal the thunder my my
[01:44:29.430 --> 01:44:31.430]  buddy got that my buddy took the shot
[01:44:31.430 --> 01:44:33.350]  and got the kill so
[01:44:33.350 --> 01:44:36.470]  uh you know our hunting trade either way
[01:44:36.470 --> 01:44:38.390]  he misses he's coming after both of you
[01:44:38.390 --> 01:44:40.790]  so you gotta trust
[01:44:40.790 --> 01:44:44.710]  but yeah the website's KNFLife.com
[01:44:44.790 --> 01:44:46.390]  instead of autoflower just put up his
[01:44:46.390 --> 01:44:47.670]  website there
[01:44:47.670 --> 01:44:49.590]  uh yeah I will do that just gonna get
[01:44:49.590 --> 01:44:51.590]  Lily to type it in give me a moment
[01:44:51.590 --> 01:44:53.270]  yeah I was just trying to scare people
[01:44:53.270 --> 01:44:55.110]  off from watching this show with my
[01:44:55.110 --> 01:44:58.470]  autoflower ak name
[01:44:58.470 --> 01:45:00.870]  yeah some people uh feel a certain way
[01:45:00.870 --> 01:45:02.550]  we even interviewed uh the guy that has
[01:45:02.550 --> 01:45:04.230]  the autoflower podcast and he kind of
[01:45:04.230 --> 01:45:06.310]  said the same thing you know like people
[01:45:06.310 --> 01:45:08.070]  people already have a strong opinion
[01:45:08.070 --> 01:45:09.670]  before he even opens his mouth about
[01:45:09.670 --> 01:45:11.910]  what he's trying okay hold on guys uh
[01:45:11.910 --> 01:45:13.590]  Lily didn't actually hear what you
[01:45:13.590 --> 01:45:16.070]  called uh called it can you say it again
[01:45:16.070 --> 01:45:16.790]  please
[01:45:16.790 --> 01:45:21.030]  yeah it's knflife.com
[01:45:21.030 --> 01:45:23.910]  oh yeah knflife life
[01:45:23.910 --> 01:45:26.550]  yeah knflife.com
[01:45:26.550 --> 01:45:28.390]  so I don't know anybody that's making
[01:45:28.390 --> 01:45:29.750]  ferments with bear
[01:45:29.750 --> 01:45:31.590]  with bear bones well that's not a
[01:45:31.590 --> 01:45:34.550]  ferment so that's an extraction
[01:45:34.550 --> 01:45:37.110]  the ferments use brown sugar so the
[01:45:37.110 --> 01:45:39.190]  extracts are like the water soluble
[01:45:39.190 --> 01:45:41.430]  calcium with eggshells
[01:45:41.430 --> 01:45:44.550]  and the water soluble calcium phosphate
[01:45:44.550 --> 01:45:46.070]  with bones
[01:45:46.070 --> 01:45:49.030]  and those are an extraction versus
[01:45:49.030 --> 01:45:51.430]  fermentation
[01:45:51.430 --> 01:45:53.750]  so can you see your screen is that the
[01:45:53.750 --> 01:45:54.470]  correct
[01:45:54.470 --> 01:45:59.830]  um address yeah that's it
[01:45:59.990 --> 01:46:02.950]  so a lot of these things are super easy
[01:46:02.950 --> 01:46:04.310]  to make I mean they're
[01:46:04.310 --> 01:46:07.110]  easy they take like most things take
[01:46:07.110 --> 01:46:10.230]  less than seven days to make so I
[01:46:10.310 --> 01:46:12.470]  really you know I provide this stuff
[01:46:12.470 --> 01:46:14.390]  because I understand a lot of people
[01:46:14.390 --> 01:46:16.070]  don't have the time
[01:46:16.070 --> 01:46:19.190]  nor the inclination to make it but
[01:46:19.190 --> 01:46:22.310]  I always preach people to
[01:46:22.310 --> 01:46:24.790]  to try it themselves like arm yourself
[01:46:24.790 --> 01:46:26.230]  with this knowledge like
[01:46:26.230 --> 01:46:28.310]  we're gonna need it over the coming 50
[01:46:28.310 --> 01:46:31.750]  years food's gonna become more scarce
[01:46:31.750 --> 01:46:35.750]  uh as you know like these are skills
[01:46:35.750 --> 01:46:37.270]  that are very
[01:46:37.270 --> 01:46:40.150]  important to have so I I encourage
[01:46:40.470 --> 01:46:44.070]  everyone to try to make their own
[01:46:44.070 --> 01:46:45.910]  with that said there are some of these
[01:46:45.910 --> 01:46:48.070]  preps that take a lot longer to make
[01:46:48.070 --> 01:46:49.670]  like ohhn
[01:46:49.670 --> 01:46:53.110]  uh faa you know the faa is fermenting
[01:46:53.110 --> 01:46:56.870]  for a minimum of six months
[01:46:56.870 --> 01:46:59.430]  but uh the ohhn is you know it takes
[01:46:59.430 --> 01:47:01.190]  three months to make you gotta stir it
[01:47:01.190 --> 01:47:02.630]  every day it's a
[01:47:02.630 --> 01:47:05.590]  it takes a lot of dedication uh and
[01:47:05.590 --> 01:47:07.910]  and you know a little bit of resources
[01:47:07.910 --> 01:47:09.270]  to get going
[01:47:09.590 --> 01:47:12.470]  so those ones are oftentimes the things
[01:47:12.470 --> 01:47:13.510]  that people will
[01:47:13.510 --> 01:47:16.070]  purchase first because you know the
[01:47:16.070 --> 01:47:18.150]  amount of
[01:47:18.150 --> 01:47:21.670]  effort it takes to create them um
[01:47:21.670 --> 01:47:23.510]  and that's fine but with that said you
[01:47:23.510 --> 01:47:25.990]  know I highly recommend people to save
[01:47:25.990 --> 01:47:26.470]  their
[01:47:26.470 --> 01:47:29.670]  egg shells after making breakfast like
[01:47:29.670 --> 01:47:32.870]  you know I always have a gallon bag of
[01:47:32.870 --> 01:47:34.150]  egg shells
[01:47:34.150 --> 01:47:36.950]  out on my front porch and every egg
[01:47:36.950 --> 01:47:38.710]  shell we use in the house
[01:47:38.710 --> 01:47:41.910]  will get a quick rinse and then uh
[01:47:41.910 --> 01:47:44.870]  get set in a container on the counter
[01:47:44.870 --> 01:47:46.150]  and then after like
[01:47:46.150 --> 01:47:47.910]  four or five days the container will
[01:47:47.910 --> 01:47:49.990]  start smelling a little bit funky
[01:47:49.990 --> 01:47:51.830]  and it gets moved outside to the one
[01:47:51.830 --> 01:47:54.790]  gallon bag once that one gallon bag is
[01:47:54.790 --> 01:47:55.350]  full
[01:47:55.350 --> 01:47:58.230]  I bring it in turn on the stove and
[01:47:58.230 --> 01:47:58.790]  roast
[01:47:58.790 --> 01:48:01.350]  those and once they're roasted I just
[01:48:01.350 --> 01:48:02.310]  keep them
[01:48:02.310 --> 01:48:06.150]  roasted in a in a in a bag until I run
[01:48:06.150 --> 01:48:07.590]  out of WCA
[01:48:07.670 --> 01:48:10.390]  whenever I'm out of calcium uh water
[01:48:10.390 --> 01:48:11.750]  soluble calcium
[01:48:11.750 --> 01:48:13.830]  I just take a small handful of these
[01:48:13.830 --> 01:48:15.590]  pre-prepped
[01:48:15.590 --> 01:48:18.950]  egg shells and pop them in a jar
[01:48:18.950 --> 01:48:22.150]  and dump some vinegar in and uh you know
[01:48:22.150 --> 01:48:22.550]  like
[01:48:22.550 --> 01:48:25.430]  uh what I'm getting at is you know
[01:48:25.430 --> 01:48:25.750]  there
[01:48:25.750 --> 01:48:27.990]  there are ways to kind of streamline
[01:48:27.990 --> 01:48:29.510]  these processes
[01:48:29.510 --> 01:48:32.550]  and they're very easy and I recommend
[01:48:32.550 --> 01:48:34.150]  people to try
[01:48:34.150 --> 01:48:36.870]  just give it a try I mean once you make
[01:48:36.870 --> 01:48:39.110]  a couple of these things and you realize
[01:48:39.110 --> 01:48:39.750]  like
[01:48:39.750 --> 01:48:43.110]  you're taking waste streams and then
[01:48:43.110 --> 01:48:45.270]  turning them into plant food
[01:48:45.270 --> 01:48:48.630]  I mean I hate spending money on on
[01:48:48.630 --> 01:48:52.870]  I buy mycorrhiza and human humic acids
[01:48:52.870 --> 01:48:56.150]  and that's it I also don't get me wrong
[01:48:56.150 --> 01:48:58.710]  I actually buy yucca
[01:48:58.710 --> 01:49:02.470]  for uh uh for uh or you know aloe vera
[01:49:02.470 --> 01:49:05.190]  powder for uh
[01:49:06.150 --> 01:49:10.230]  a surfactant um and then besides that I
[01:49:10.230 --> 01:49:11.830]  buy brown sugars
[01:49:11.830 --> 01:49:15.830]  and I buy vinegars and that's it that
[01:49:15.830 --> 01:49:19.350]  you know um you can really save a lot of
[01:49:19.350 --> 01:49:21.110]  money start putting this money into
[01:49:21.110 --> 01:49:22.710]  something else
[01:49:22.710 --> 01:49:25.110]  you know you can you can turn around and
[01:49:25.110 --> 01:49:25.590]  and
[01:49:25.590 --> 01:49:28.310]  and buy some badass seeds or you know do
[01:49:28.310 --> 01:49:30.310]  whatever you want with that extra money
[01:49:30.310 --> 01:49:31.430]  but uh
[01:49:31.430 --> 01:49:35.030]  but you know it's uh it definitely feels
[01:49:35.110 --> 01:49:35.670]  good
[01:49:35.670 --> 01:49:37.510]  to be turning something that would just
[01:49:37.510 --> 01:49:39.990]  be going into the trash into plant food
[01:49:39.990 --> 01:49:41.510]  and I'll tell you what you really feel
[01:49:41.510 --> 01:49:43.670]  like when you're pulling off successful
[01:49:43.670 --> 01:49:46.230]  crop after successful crop with stuff
[01:49:46.230 --> 01:49:47.830]  that you're making you feel like a
[01:49:47.830 --> 01:49:49.430]  fucking plant wizard
[01:49:49.430 --> 01:49:50.790]  and you feel like you're growing the
[01:49:50.790 --> 01:49:53.430]  dankest of the dank because you know
[01:49:53.430 --> 01:49:54.790]  you're just
[01:49:54.790 --> 01:49:57.510]  you're you're using you're using low
[01:49:57.510 --> 01:49:58.950]  cost scraps
[01:49:58.950 --> 01:50:02.390]  to make this shit happen hey green since
[01:50:02.390 --> 01:50:04.310]  you're selling ohn put up your site on
[01:50:04.550 --> 01:50:06.630]  on the chat there girl get you some
[01:50:06.630 --> 01:50:07.910]  business
[01:50:07.910 --> 01:50:09.830]  damn right we're all about helping in
[01:50:09.830 --> 01:50:12.230]  community here right so yeah
[01:50:12.230 --> 01:50:18.020]  share oh real quick there was something
[01:50:18.020 --> 01:50:19.860]  I wanted to mention too
[01:50:19.860 --> 01:50:22.180]  most people are starting off their very
[01:50:22.180 --> 01:50:24.660]  first thing that they're making in kfsf
[01:50:24.660 --> 01:50:27.780]  is an fpj fermented plant juice
[01:50:27.780 --> 01:50:29.860]  that's great you know it's a great uh
[01:50:29.860 --> 01:50:31.220]  first thing to make
[01:50:31.220 --> 01:50:34.900]  uh but whenever fermented plant juice is
[01:50:34.900 --> 01:50:35.940]  being used it's
[01:50:35.940 --> 01:50:39.620]  always always always used with vinegar
[01:50:39.620 --> 01:50:41.780]  so if you're using eight milliliters of
[01:50:41.780 --> 01:50:44.100]  fpj per gallon of water
[01:50:44.100 --> 01:50:47.540]  you will always add eight milliliters of
[01:50:47.540 --> 01:50:50.580]  vinegar as well they go hand in hand
[01:50:50.580 --> 01:50:53.220]  you'll never ever use fpj without
[01:50:53.220 --> 01:50:54.100]  vinegar
[01:50:54.100 --> 01:50:58.100]  if you do you are inviting pests
[01:50:58.100 --> 01:51:00.580]  especially aphids and when I first
[01:51:00.580 --> 01:51:02.340]  started getting into this obviously
[01:51:02.340 --> 01:51:04.020]  there was a little bit of information
[01:51:04.020 --> 01:51:05.380]  but not a ton
[01:51:05.380 --> 01:51:07.460]  and everyone's talking about fpj's and
[01:51:07.460 --> 01:51:09.220]  it's the very first thing I made and I
[01:51:09.220 --> 01:51:11.140]  sprained it all over my whole
[01:51:11.140 --> 01:51:14.340]  fucking yard and next thing I know I
[01:51:14.340 --> 01:51:15.300]  have the worst
[01:51:15.300 --> 01:51:17.940]  aphid infestation on my whole property
[01:51:17.940 --> 01:51:20.020]  that I've ever seen in my whole life
[01:51:20.020 --> 01:51:23.860]  and um and the following year I end up
[01:51:23.860 --> 01:51:24.820]  finding out that
[01:51:24.820 --> 01:51:29.540]  oh it's because I wasn't mixing it with
[01:51:29.540 --> 01:51:32.660]  vinegar as well the vinegar somehow like
[01:51:32.660 --> 01:51:33.940]  counteracts
[01:51:33.940 --> 01:51:38.420]  the sweetness and uh and since I
[01:51:38.420 --> 01:51:40.740]  you know started doing that I haven't
[01:51:40.740 --> 01:51:41.460]  had any
[01:51:41.460 --> 01:51:44.260]  sort of pest pressure outside of normal
[01:51:44.260 --> 01:51:46.100]  normal pest pressure so
[01:51:46.100 --> 01:51:47.700]  I think that's something that a lot of
[01:51:47.700 --> 01:51:49.940]  people are are out there doing wrong
[01:51:49.940 --> 01:51:50.980]  right now
[01:51:50.980 --> 01:51:53.940]  and uh it's basically a maintenance
[01:51:53.940 --> 01:51:55.940]  solution is what it's called
[01:51:55.940 --> 01:51:58.580]  whenever you're feeding anything in knf
[01:51:58.580 --> 01:52:02.340]  you're all the base the base solution is
[01:52:02.340 --> 01:52:03.940]  always going to be your maintenance
[01:52:03.940 --> 01:52:06.740]  solution which is fpj
[01:52:06.740 --> 01:52:10.980]  vinegar and ohn and
[01:52:10.980 --> 01:52:13.060]  that will be the first thing you always
[01:52:13.060 --> 01:52:14.260]  mix up and then
[01:52:14.260 --> 01:52:17.060]  everything else that that you might need
[01:52:17.060 --> 01:52:17.540]  will get
[01:52:17.540 --> 01:52:20.740]  added to that as the base
[01:52:20.740 --> 01:52:22.740]  that will always be the base you can
[01:52:22.740 --> 01:52:24.980]  spray it multiple times a week
[01:52:24.980 --> 01:52:29.460]  it's a really minor nutrient but
[01:52:29.780 --> 01:52:32.580]  yeah that's uh the uh
[01:52:32.580 --> 01:52:34.900]  also the ohn isn't necessary you can
[01:52:34.900 --> 01:52:36.980]  leave out the ohn and just use
[01:52:36.980 --> 01:52:40.260]  the base of fpj and vinegar
[01:52:40.260 --> 01:52:43.620]  but I just want to really hammer that
[01:52:43.620 --> 01:52:47.700]  uh that thought home
[01:52:47.700 --> 01:52:50.740]  because I know that there are tens of
[01:52:50.740 --> 01:52:52.100]  thousands of people
[01:52:52.100 --> 01:52:55.300]  around here spraying fpjs on their crops
[01:52:55.300 --> 01:52:56.340]  without uh
[01:52:56.340 --> 01:52:59.060]  without vinegar and that's a no-no so
[01:52:59.060 --> 01:53:00.660]  and you know what else is a real
[01:53:00.660 --> 01:53:04.020]  problem too is morons like
[01:53:04.020 --> 01:53:06.820]  so many people have got anaerobic soil
[01:53:06.820 --> 01:53:09.300]  because they sprayed so much on they
[01:53:09.300 --> 01:53:12.100]  didn't follow the dilution ratios so
[01:53:12.100 --> 01:53:13.700]  yeah you want to speak on that a little
[01:53:13.700 --> 01:53:15.060]  and beat that the fuck into these
[01:53:15.060 --> 01:53:17.460]  people's heads
[01:53:17.460 --> 01:53:19.860]  yeah absolutely these things are super
[01:53:19.860 --> 01:53:22.020]  super concentrated
[01:53:22.020 --> 01:53:25.220]  uh super strong I mean when you're first
[01:53:25.220 --> 01:53:28.100]  measuring these things out
[01:53:28.100 --> 01:53:31.540]  you know two milliliters per gallon
[01:53:31.540 --> 01:53:34.980]  just doesn't you know it doesn't seem
[01:53:34.980 --> 01:53:38.900]  like enough to be effective but there
[01:53:38.900 --> 01:53:42.260]  these dilution rates have you know been
[01:53:42.260 --> 01:53:44.500]  set this way for a reason like these
[01:53:44.500 --> 01:53:44.980]  plant
[01:53:44.980 --> 01:53:48.420]  ferments and extracts are very powerful
[01:53:48.420 --> 01:53:51.540]  and uh and I've already mentioned to you
[01:53:51.540 --> 01:53:52.580]  guys
[01:53:52.580 --> 01:53:55.620]  how many plants I've killed through this
[01:53:55.620 --> 01:53:57.300]  learning process
[01:53:57.620 --> 01:54:00.340]  so when you when you measure out eight
[01:54:00.340 --> 01:54:04.100]  eight milliliters don't feel like you
[01:54:04.100 --> 01:54:05.940]  should just add
[01:54:05.940 --> 01:54:09.140]  two more ten just because you know
[01:54:09.140 --> 01:54:11.060]  because it'll make your plants better
[01:54:11.060 --> 01:54:14.900]  stick with the dilution rates prescribed
[01:54:14.900 --> 01:54:18.340]  and uh and yeah if anything
[01:54:18.340 --> 01:54:23.060]  you can go lower you know start lower
[01:54:23.060 --> 01:54:27.140]  um but these are powerful these are
[01:54:27.140 --> 01:54:30.260]  powerful tools the all all of these
[01:54:30.260 --> 01:54:31.460]  nutrients
[01:54:31.460 --> 01:54:35.620]  uh you know are are plant available
[01:54:35.620 --> 01:54:38.260]  and and they're powerful and you can
[01:54:38.260 --> 01:54:40.020]  really mess some stuff up if you're not
[01:54:40.020 --> 01:54:42.100]  applying these right so
[01:54:42.100 --> 01:54:45.380]  yeah don't be a moron moron
[01:54:45.380 --> 01:54:47.140]  and the other thing is don't use them
[01:54:47.140 --> 01:54:49.140]  out of order you just said something
[01:54:49.140 --> 01:54:50.980]  that's critical and a lot of people
[01:54:50.980 --> 01:54:52.020]  fuck this up
[01:54:52.020 --> 01:54:53.780]  you use the wrong nutrient when you're
[01:54:53.780 --> 01:54:55.860]  flipping into flour you're gonna fuck
[01:54:55.860 --> 01:54:57.220]  up the flour process
[01:54:57.220 --> 01:54:59.540]  so there's you've got to fucking follow
[01:54:59.540 --> 01:55:00.740]  the directions
[01:55:00.740 --> 01:55:03.060]  this shit will fuck up stuff if you
[01:55:03.060 --> 01:55:03.780]  don't
[01:55:03.780 --> 01:55:07.780]  follow the fucking directions yeah yeah
[01:55:07.780 --> 01:55:10.340]  another thing is the plants the cannabis
[01:55:10.340 --> 01:55:12.740]  plants they're using
[01:55:12.740 --> 01:55:15.380]  every nutrient and mineral at every
[01:55:15.380 --> 01:55:17.300]  phase of their life
[01:55:17.300 --> 01:55:19.060]  just because the plant is switching to
[01:55:19.060 --> 01:55:21.540]  flour does not mean that it's not using
[01:55:21.540 --> 01:55:22.980]  nitrogen anymore
[01:55:22.980 --> 01:55:25.780]  nitrogen is being applied all the way up
[01:55:25.860 --> 01:55:28.980]  to the very end it's just being ramped
[01:55:28.980 --> 01:55:29.700]  down
[01:55:29.700 --> 01:55:32.100]  it's full strength at the beginning
[01:55:32.100 --> 01:55:33.220]  transition
[01:55:33.220 --> 01:55:36.340]  it's medium strength flour it's low
[01:55:36.340 --> 01:55:37.300]  strength
[01:55:37.300 --> 01:55:39.860]  and then late flower it's extra low
[01:55:39.860 --> 01:55:40.740]  strength
[01:55:40.740 --> 01:55:43.780]  same with everything calcium phosphorus
[01:55:43.780 --> 01:55:45.540]  magnesium
[01:55:45.540 --> 01:55:48.660]  calcium like the plant is at every
[01:55:48.660 --> 01:55:50.100]  single stage
[01:55:50.100 --> 01:55:52.980]  in its life it's using all of the
[01:55:52.980 --> 01:55:54.500]  nutrients and minerals
[01:55:54.500 --> 01:55:57.540]  just in different amounts so
[01:55:57.540 --> 01:56:00.900]  you so my way of thinking about it
[01:56:00.900 --> 01:56:01.620]  is
[01:56:01.620 --> 01:56:05.460]  in veg you're the plant is doing a lot
[01:56:05.460 --> 01:56:05.940]  of
[01:56:05.940 --> 01:56:08.500]  a lot of growth you want high nitrogen as
[01:56:08.500 --> 01:56:09.140]  soon as
[01:56:09.140 --> 01:56:10.900]  the plant's going through transition
[01:56:10.900 --> 01:56:12.900]  about a week before you flip it to
[01:56:12.900 --> 01:56:13.460]  flour
[01:56:13.460 --> 01:56:15.540]  or it starts flowering on its own if
[01:56:15.540 --> 01:56:18.180]  you're using auto flowers
[01:56:18.180 --> 01:56:20.900]  then you need to bump up the phosphorus
[01:56:20.900 --> 01:56:23.780]  phosphorus goes to full strength the
[01:56:24.340 --> 01:56:28.340]  nitrogen drops to half strength and
[01:56:28.340 --> 01:56:31.860]  and also when you're in
[01:56:31.860 --> 01:56:35.060]  the veg state your potassium is at
[01:56:35.060 --> 01:56:37.540]  at low strength so once you go into
[01:56:37.540 --> 01:56:38.420]  transition
[01:56:38.420 --> 01:56:40.660]  phosphorus goes up to full strength
[01:56:40.660 --> 01:56:42.500]  pota
[01:56:42.500 --> 01:56:44.980]  i'm sorry yeah and potassium goes up to
[01:56:44.980 --> 01:56:46.580]  medium strength
[01:56:46.580 --> 01:56:49.620]  so then you switch to straight flour
[01:56:49.620 --> 01:56:52.100]  and your phosphorus drops down to
[01:56:52.100 --> 01:56:54.100]  medium strength and your potassium
[01:56:54.100 --> 01:56:56.260]  drops to high strength or goes up to
[01:56:56.260 --> 01:56:58.100]  high strength and nitrogen
[01:56:58.100 --> 01:57:00.180]  goes down to low so you're just
[01:57:00.180 --> 01:57:01.060]  constantly
[01:57:01.060 --> 01:57:04.340]  fiddling with the with the amounts
[01:57:04.340 --> 01:57:07.380]  of of nutrients uh to
[01:57:07.380 --> 01:57:10.260]  to really to hit what the plant needs at
[01:57:10.260 --> 01:57:11.460]  a certain time
[01:57:11.460 --> 01:57:13.780]  that needs to be time stamped somebody
[01:57:13.780 --> 01:57:16.100]  time stamp that shit also
[01:57:16.100 --> 01:57:17.540]  with that time stamp i was hoping
[01:57:17.540 --> 01:57:19.220]  layton you knew because what he's kind
[01:57:19.220 --> 01:57:20.500]  of talking about at least from the
[01:57:20.500 --> 01:57:21.620]  background of like a
[01:57:21.620 --> 01:57:25.060]  beginner playbook was the 321123
[01:57:25.060 --> 01:57:26.740]  method and i know somebody is
[01:57:26.740 --> 01:57:28.260]  credited with that i wasn't sure if you
[01:57:28.260 --> 01:57:30.580]  knew who that was so that people could
[01:57:30.580 --> 01:57:31.940]  go down the rabbit hole that he's
[01:57:31.940 --> 01:57:34.660]  talking more about i don't know who
[01:57:34.660 --> 01:57:36.980]  talked i don't know who all right
[01:57:36.980 --> 01:57:38.580]  hopefully we could or maybe the the
[01:57:38.580 --> 01:57:39.220]  audience
[01:57:39.220 --> 01:57:42.580]  uh it was 321123 very basic things for
[01:57:42.580 --> 01:57:43.700]  for farming
[01:57:43.700 --> 01:57:45.380]  uh but someone came up with that term
[01:57:45.380 --> 01:57:47.460]  and if you're super new to this
[01:57:47.460 --> 01:57:48.900]  um and trying to understand more what
[01:57:48.900 --> 01:57:50.180]  he's talking about
[01:57:50.180 --> 01:57:51.780]  that's an excellent rabbit hole to go
[01:57:51.780 --> 01:57:54.180]  down yeah and a lot of people don't
[01:57:54.180 --> 01:57:57.060]  understand how critical potassium is
[01:57:57.060 --> 01:57:59.780]  at the end it's fucking critical
[01:57:59.780 --> 01:58:01.220]  all they care about is nitrogen
[01:58:01.220 --> 01:58:03.620]  phosphorus but nobody talks about
[01:58:03.620 --> 01:58:05.700]  you know bumping that that potassium so
[01:58:05.700 --> 01:58:06.660]  that's why i'm like
[01:58:06.660 --> 01:58:08.980]  go fucking stamp that shit that was that
[01:58:08.980 --> 01:58:10.740]  was a fucking treasure chest
[01:58:10.740 --> 01:58:14.180]  of information right there or direction
[01:58:14.180 --> 01:58:16.180]  that wasn't just a bar that was a
[01:58:16.180 --> 01:58:18.660]  bloody truckload that's what i deliver
[01:58:18.660 --> 01:58:19.940]  guys hey
[01:58:19.940 --> 01:58:24.260]  what are you doing thank you thank you
[01:58:24.260 --> 01:58:26.660]  yeah potassium is very important and i
[01:58:26.660 --> 01:58:27.460]  hammer
[01:58:27.460 --> 01:58:31.220]  potassium and late flower uh but i
[01:58:31.220 --> 01:58:33.460]  provide potassium from
[01:58:33.460 --> 01:58:37.060]  uh from the very beginning to the very
[01:58:37.060 --> 01:58:40.500]  end uh i recently was listening to
[01:58:40.500 --> 01:58:44.500]  one of the uh hoda herbs grow and tells
[01:58:44.500 --> 01:58:47.140]  uh with that super smart dude he has i
[01:58:47.140 --> 01:58:49.060]  can't think of his name that comes on
[01:58:49.060 --> 01:58:52.500]  and he was talking about potassium and
[01:58:52.500 --> 01:58:55.140]  and i didn't realize how many functions
[01:58:55.140 --> 01:58:57.220]  within the plant the potassium
[01:58:57.220 --> 01:59:00.420]  actually controls and and you know
[01:59:00.420 --> 01:59:03.780]  effects and i think that there are so
[01:59:03.780 --> 01:59:05.460]  many people in the cannabis
[01:59:05.460 --> 01:59:07.620]  industry right now that are under
[01:59:07.620 --> 01:59:10.820]  feeding potassium the whole way through
[01:59:10.820 --> 01:59:14.180]  and don't get it wrong you stacking
[01:59:14.180 --> 01:59:17.780]  flowers like you know bulking comes from
[01:59:17.780 --> 01:59:19.540]  the potassium
[01:59:19.540 --> 01:59:23.140]  so don't be afraid to you know really
[01:59:23.140 --> 01:59:26.980]  ramp up on that without you know going
[01:59:26.980 --> 01:59:28.100]  like above the
[01:59:28.100 --> 01:59:30.020]  when i say ramp up i'm not talking about
[01:59:30.020 --> 01:59:32.100]  like being a moron like going over the
[01:59:32.100 --> 01:59:35.300]  dilution rates but you know full strength
[01:59:35.300 --> 01:59:38.180]  and uh and yeah potassium man is what i
[01:59:38.180 --> 01:59:39.620]  feel like it's one of the most
[01:59:39.620 --> 01:59:42.820]  underrated minerals
[01:59:42.820 --> 01:59:48.100]  and uh uh within growing cannabis that
[01:59:48.100 --> 01:59:51.860]  and calcium and calcium and salt
[01:59:51.860 --> 01:59:54.500]  sulfur is another one i like what rusty
[01:59:54.500 --> 01:59:56.500]  nails just said um i've personally seen
[01:59:56.500 --> 01:59:58.020]  that when you're throwing some of those
[01:59:58.020 --> 02:00:00.100]  um you know you're throwing your your
[02:00:00.100 --> 02:00:01.940]  trimmings back into the worm bins but
[02:00:01.940 --> 02:00:03.140]  especially when you're using a little
[02:00:03.140 --> 02:00:04.340]  bit of the sugar
[02:00:04.340 --> 02:00:06.180]  the sugar leaves seem to give a little
[02:00:06.180 --> 02:00:09.460]  catalyst uh for your worm bins
[02:00:09.460 --> 02:00:10.980]  i didn't want to let that go that's a
[02:00:10.980 --> 02:00:13.060]  gold bar right there from yeah i don't
[02:00:13.060 --> 02:00:16.260]  i don't understand why all of that plant
[02:00:16.260 --> 02:00:18.660]  is not composted and put right back on
[02:00:18.660 --> 02:00:20.420]  top of the fucking growth
[02:00:20.420 --> 02:00:22.820]  i mean that's that is what the plant
[02:00:22.820 --> 02:00:23.860]  took up
[02:00:23.860 --> 02:00:26.420]  so you may you now have it in a in a
[02:00:26.420 --> 02:00:29.220]  much easier form to break down
[02:00:29.220 --> 02:00:31.620]  and that's all the plant will fucking
[02:00:31.620 --> 02:00:32.260]  get to
[02:00:32.260 --> 02:00:34.820]  freely use it up instead of burning all
[02:00:34.820 --> 02:00:36.340]  its adp
[02:00:36.340 --> 02:00:39.540]  uh in photosynthesizing to make um
[02:00:39.620 --> 02:00:42.100]  exudates so you're jumping you jump
[02:00:42.100 --> 02:00:44.820]  starting the whole plant so yeah trim
[02:00:44.820 --> 02:00:47.300]  stalks leaves anything you're not using
[02:00:47.300 --> 02:00:49.140]  should go either in the compost or under
[02:00:49.140 --> 02:00:50.020]  your one
[02:00:50.020 --> 02:00:53.700]  feed plants plants anyone
[02:00:53.700 --> 02:00:55.460]  the first person i ever heard that where
[02:00:55.460 --> 02:00:56.980]  i guess i understood
[02:00:56.980 --> 02:00:58.900]  this and then i felt like jeff lowenfels
[02:00:58.900 --> 02:01:00.740]  broke it down for me more was from dr
[02:01:00.740 --> 02:01:02.420]  lane ingham which she was like
[02:01:02.420 --> 02:01:04.260]  hey everybody loves little little cakes
[02:01:04.260 --> 02:01:06.740]  and cookies so it seems like having the
[02:01:06.740 --> 02:01:08.420]  trichomes and just having the
[02:01:08.420 --> 02:01:11.780]  the extra umf uh from that leaf material
[02:01:11.780 --> 02:01:12.900]  seems to just give it
[02:01:12.900 --> 02:01:14.580]  uh what you're trying to build within
[02:01:14.580 --> 02:01:17.140]  that soil system that extra umf to just
[02:01:17.140 --> 02:01:17.940]  kind of
[02:01:17.940 --> 02:01:21.460]  uh really improve flip after flip i mean
[02:01:21.460 --> 02:01:23.540]  if it's really dialed in i it should be
[02:01:23.540 --> 02:01:24.660]  almost weekly or
[02:01:24.660 --> 02:01:27.460]  or uh bi-monthly where you're you're
[02:01:27.460 --> 02:01:28.500]  noticing with your
[02:01:28.500 --> 02:01:29.940]  with the naked eye things are really
[02:01:29.940 --> 02:01:34.310]  starting to churn for you
[02:01:34.310 --> 02:01:36.150]  yeah absolutely i like what you guys are
[02:01:36.150 --> 02:01:37.270]  saying when uh
[02:01:37.270 --> 02:01:39.030]  when we talk about cannabis being
[02:01:39.030 --> 02:01:41.110]  nutrient demanding plants i mean those
[02:01:41.110 --> 02:01:42.870]  nutrients are going somewhere
[02:01:42.870 --> 02:01:44.790]  uh you know a good amount of them's going
[02:01:44.790 --> 02:01:46.790]  into the flowers which we're harvesting
[02:01:46.790 --> 02:01:49.350]  and you know doing what we do but a good
[02:01:49.350 --> 02:01:50.310]  amount of that
[02:01:50.310 --> 02:01:53.350]  that stuff also goes into the leaves so
[02:01:53.350 --> 02:01:55.910]  you know you can um like you were saying
[02:01:55.910 --> 02:01:57.750]  compost everything
[02:01:57.750 --> 02:02:00.310]  composting is another thing that i you
[02:02:00.310 --> 02:02:00.790]  know
[02:02:00.790 --> 02:02:04.230]  it's a passion of mine and uh i think
[02:02:04.230 --> 02:02:05.430]  more people need to
[02:02:05.430 --> 02:02:09.110]  start uh implementing uh you know within
[02:02:09.110 --> 02:02:10.470]  reason a lot of people live in
[02:02:10.470 --> 02:02:13.430]  apartments and and whatnot in which case
[02:02:13.430 --> 02:02:15.190]  like late was saying you know worm bins
[02:02:15.190 --> 02:02:17.990]  to be great bokashi composting but
[02:02:17.990 --> 02:02:19.990]  the thing is the amount of waste that
[02:02:19.990 --> 02:02:22.390]  americans are creating
[02:02:22.390 --> 02:02:25.670]  every single day is fucking astonishing
[02:02:25.670 --> 02:02:27.350]  and if we could start turning some of
[02:02:27.350 --> 02:02:29.270]  these waste streams into
[02:02:29.270 --> 02:02:32.630]  plant food i mean it's it's just
[02:02:32.630 --> 02:02:35.190]  beneficial all the way around so
[02:02:35.190 --> 02:02:37.510]  so if you're not implement if you if
[02:02:37.510 --> 02:02:39.030]  you're even if you're in a small
[02:02:39.030 --> 02:02:41.590]  apartment you know you could get a small
[02:02:41.590 --> 02:02:42.470]  bin
[02:02:42.470 --> 02:02:44.630]  and or a five gallon bucket and find a
[02:02:44.630 --> 02:02:46.230]  spot to tuck it but
[02:02:46.230 --> 02:02:49.030]  i feel like more people need to start
[02:02:49.030 --> 02:02:49.590]  you know
[02:02:49.590 --> 02:02:53.190]  implementing some form of of of
[02:02:53.190 --> 02:02:55.830]  composting and and breaking down these
[02:02:55.830 --> 02:02:56.870]  food scraps
[02:02:56.870 --> 02:02:58.470]  and i'll tell you what once you have
[02:02:58.470 --> 02:03:01.030]  these finished products and and you're
[02:03:01.030 --> 02:03:03.190]  you're adding them back into
[02:03:03.270 --> 02:03:06.470]  your soils that you're building like it
[02:03:06.470 --> 02:03:10.630]  it's these closed loop systems that that
[02:03:10.630 --> 02:03:13.110]  that i feel like is is what this world
[02:03:13.110 --> 02:03:16.070]  needs more of right now
[02:03:16.070 --> 02:03:18.870]  dude agreed 100 so since you're so
[02:03:18.870 --> 02:03:20.470]  passionate about compost are you
[02:03:20.470 --> 02:03:22.150]  thermophilic are you low temp
[02:03:22.150 --> 02:03:25.750]  bio what do you how do you uh
[02:03:25.750 --> 02:03:27.910]  this is my fourth year my fourth year
[02:03:27.910 --> 02:03:29.990]  composting the first three years i did
[02:03:29.990 --> 02:03:31.830]  thermophilic composting
[02:03:31.830 --> 02:03:35.110]  and uh and you know that's it's i end
[02:03:35.110 --> 02:03:37.270]  up having to turn the pile twice
[02:03:37.270 --> 02:03:40.710]  a week and and uh i'm not as one
[02:03:40.710 --> 02:03:43.510]  young as i once was and you know it's a
[02:03:43.510 --> 02:03:45.910]  lot of work so this is the
[02:03:45.910 --> 02:03:49.670]  and i just got so much stuff i got so
[02:03:49.670 --> 02:03:52.310]  much stuff going on on the property
[02:03:52.310 --> 02:03:54.470]  you know we're growing all sorts of
[02:03:54.470 --> 02:03:56.310]  vegetables and life
[02:03:56.310 --> 02:03:59.110]  and and so this year late and i'm
[02:03:59.110 --> 02:03:59.990]  actually
[02:04:00.070 --> 02:04:03.990]  i built my compost pile and uh i'm
[02:04:03.990 --> 02:04:07.030]  keeping an eye on it and i'm just gonna
[02:04:07.030 --> 02:04:07.910]  let it
[02:04:07.910 --> 02:04:11.190]  let it rock no turn uh
[02:04:11.190 --> 02:04:14.550]  i'm not i don't want it to get above 120
[02:04:14.550 --> 02:04:17.670]  and it hasn't yet i'm just i'm going the
[02:04:17.670 --> 02:04:19.110]  imo route
[02:04:19.110 --> 02:04:21.190]  in the past it's like okay what are you
[02:04:21.190 --> 02:04:22.550]  not do you want to
[02:04:22.550 --> 02:04:26.470]  not have seeds or would you rather have
[02:04:26.470 --> 02:04:28.790]  all this biology in your soil and the
[02:04:28.790 --> 02:04:30.790]  problem with alaska is
[02:04:30.790 --> 02:04:32.950]  we have a really short period of time
[02:04:32.950 --> 02:04:33.750]  when it's not
[02:04:33.750 --> 02:04:37.110]  fucking frozen north so you finish this
[02:04:37.110 --> 02:04:39.190]  uh thermophilic phase and yeah your
[02:04:39.190 --> 02:04:41.430]  compost looks like it's nice and black
[02:04:41.430 --> 02:04:43.110]  and ready to use
[02:04:43.110 --> 02:04:46.230]  but the biology was just killed off and
[02:04:46.230 --> 02:04:48.390]  then you're going into winter
[02:04:48.390 --> 02:04:51.510]  where the biology can't come back in and
[02:04:51.510 --> 02:04:52.790]  refill
[02:04:52.790 --> 02:04:55.110]  that space so now it's sitting all
[02:04:55.110 --> 02:04:55.990]  winter long
[02:04:55.990 --> 02:04:58.230]  and then next summer it starts its
[02:04:58.230 --> 02:04:59.750]  mesophilic phase
[02:04:59.750 --> 02:05:01.750]  so you end up not even really being able
[02:05:01.750 --> 02:05:03.430]  to use this compost
[02:05:03.430 --> 02:05:05.990]  for almost two years technically up here
[02:05:05.990 --> 02:05:07.990]  because of our long winters
[02:05:07.990 --> 02:05:10.150]  so this year i'm trying a little bit of
[02:05:10.150 --> 02:05:11.590]  a different method
[02:05:11.590 --> 02:05:15.350]  and no turning maintain the biology
[02:05:15.350 --> 02:05:18.470]  uh i'm new to i'm new to this style so
[02:05:18.470 --> 02:05:21.190]  i i'm not sure how it's gonna
[02:05:21.190 --> 02:05:24.470]  go down yet but uh but basically what
[02:05:24.470 --> 02:05:27.670]  i'm doing is all uh all summer long i'm
[02:05:27.670 --> 02:05:30.150]  uh uh all the scraps from our kitchen all
[02:05:30.150 --> 02:05:31.590]  this uh all the
[02:05:31.590 --> 02:05:34.630]  scraps from our yard i'm collecting in a
[02:05:34.630 --> 02:05:36.550]  pile it's my green pile i'm just
[02:05:36.550 --> 02:05:37.430]  building it up
[02:05:37.430 --> 02:05:40.310]  building it up and then in the fall once
[02:05:40.310 --> 02:05:42.630]  everything starts coming down
[02:05:42.630 --> 02:05:45.670]  uh you know plants start dying mowing the
[02:05:45.670 --> 02:05:46.230]  lawn
[02:05:46.230 --> 02:05:48.310]  all that stuff i'm just gathering
[02:05:48.310 --> 02:05:50.070]  gathering gathering
[02:05:50.070 --> 02:05:54.230]  uh building up this stack of greens
[02:05:54.230 --> 02:05:56.950]  and then we go into winter time and i'm
[02:05:56.950 --> 02:05:59.750]  at that point i'm just gathering uh food
[02:05:59.750 --> 02:06:01.750]  scraps from our house but also
[02:06:01.750 --> 02:06:04.790]  keeping my eyes open like at work in the
[02:06:04.790 --> 02:06:06.790]  break room i mean we probably go through
[02:06:06.790 --> 02:06:08.550]  10 pounds of coffee every week
[02:06:08.550 --> 02:06:11.110]  i collect all that shit you know spent
[02:06:11.110 --> 02:06:12.630]  grain from the brewery
[02:06:12.630 --> 02:06:15.830]  uh sometimes we're making like petal uh
[02:06:15.830 --> 02:06:19.670]  you know uh rose petal uh
[02:06:19.670 --> 02:06:23.030]  spirits or or we're making chaga beer or
[02:06:23.030 --> 02:06:23.990]  you know like
[02:06:23.990 --> 02:06:26.390]  i work at a brewery so we have a lot of
[02:06:26.390 --> 02:06:28.790]  byproducts and and i'm taking all that
[02:06:28.790 --> 02:06:29.510]  home
[02:06:29.510 --> 02:06:31.510]  and i'm adding it to the compost all
[02:06:31.510 --> 02:06:33.190]  winter long so i'm just
[02:06:33.190 --> 02:06:36.790]  still building up this stack of greens
[02:06:36.790 --> 02:06:39.990]  and then as soon as spring hits
[02:06:39.990 --> 02:06:43.430]  you know i add in all the browns
[02:06:43.430 --> 02:06:45.830]  i start layering first off so i got my
[02:06:45.830 --> 02:06:47.190]  big pile of greens
[02:06:47.190 --> 02:06:49.990]  and in the fall i was you know i i rake
[02:06:49.990 --> 02:06:52.310]  all my leaves right outside my compost
[02:06:52.310 --> 02:06:54.470]  bins and i just let them sit there
[02:06:54.470 --> 02:06:57.350]  and then uh as soon as uh spring hits
[02:06:57.350 --> 02:06:59.590]  and and it melts enough for me to start
[02:06:59.590 --> 02:07:00.470]  working it
[02:07:00.470 --> 02:07:03.510]  then i start lasagna uh greens
[02:07:03.510 --> 02:07:07.510]  browns spray greens brown spray and just
[02:07:07.510 --> 02:07:10.310]  and and then and you spend you know a
[02:07:10.310 --> 02:07:11.110]  good day
[02:07:11.110 --> 02:07:13.990]  working hard and building this pile and
[02:07:13.990 --> 02:07:15.670]  i think a lot of people are kind of
[02:07:15.670 --> 02:07:16.630]  picturing like
[02:07:16.630 --> 02:07:19.670]  actively composting you know
[02:07:19.670 --> 02:07:21.590]  constantly like maybe you fill up a
[02:07:21.590 --> 02:07:23.990]  bucket in your house of greens and you
[02:07:23.990 --> 02:07:25.590]  take them out there and you dump them in
[02:07:25.590 --> 02:07:26.150]  the
[02:07:26.150 --> 02:07:28.310]  compost and add some browns and you're
[02:07:28.310 --> 02:07:30.150]  constantly doing this
[02:07:30.150 --> 02:07:34.070]  like i've found better uh success like
[02:07:34.070 --> 02:07:36.470]  building up my pile of greens and once i
[02:07:36.470 --> 02:07:38.230]  finally have enough
[02:07:38.230 --> 02:07:41.030]  to create a mass that's big enough to
[02:07:41.030 --> 02:07:42.950]  get a compost pile going
[02:07:42.950 --> 02:07:45.750]  that's when i create it and let it rock
[02:07:45.750 --> 02:07:47.750]  and uh i'll tell you what it feels
[02:07:47.750 --> 02:07:49.190]  really good to
[02:07:49.190 --> 02:07:51.910]  make your own compost and within like
[02:07:51.910 --> 02:07:53.510]  if you're going thermophilic
[02:07:53.510 --> 02:07:56.710]  within four weeks your your your stuff
[02:07:56.710 --> 02:07:59.910]  ends up looking like black compost it
[02:07:59.910 --> 02:08:01.670]  might not be ready to use yet
[02:08:01.670 --> 02:08:05.030]  but it's pretty amazing how quickly that
[02:08:05.030 --> 02:08:06.550]  breakdown process
[02:08:06.550 --> 02:08:09.590]  can happen yeah that's the side the
[02:08:09.590 --> 02:08:11.270]  other side of the coin when you're when
[02:08:11.270 --> 02:08:13.510]  you're making biological or low temp
[02:08:13.510 --> 02:08:14.630]  compost
[02:08:14.630 --> 02:08:16.950]  it doesn't break down you have to you
[02:08:16.950 --> 02:08:19.110]  have to actually extract it
[02:08:19.110 --> 02:08:21.830]  so what i tell people to do is even
[02:08:21.830 --> 02:08:22.630]  though it doesn't
[02:08:22.630 --> 02:08:24.230]  look finished doesn't mean that it
[02:08:24.230 --> 02:08:25.670]  doesn't have value
[02:08:25.670 --> 02:08:28.230]  so just all you do is take a you know a
[02:08:28.230 --> 02:08:30.230]  five gallon bucket throw about a gallon
[02:08:30.230 --> 02:08:31.670]  of compost in there
[02:08:31.670 --> 02:08:33.510]  a couple gallons of water take your
[02:08:33.510 --> 02:08:35.350]  paint mixer on the end of your cordless
[02:08:35.350 --> 02:08:36.230]  drill
[02:08:36.230 --> 02:08:39.270]  don't don't beat it just want to turn it
[02:08:39.270 --> 02:08:41.270]  over a bunch of times slow
[02:08:41.270 --> 02:08:43.350]  and then pour that shit out oh my god
[02:08:43.350 --> 02:08:44.950]  there you go there's a
[02:08:44.950 --> 02:08:49.350]  biological for anything that you want and so
[02:08:49.350 --> 02:08:52.550]  don't judge the compost by what it looks
[02:08:52.550 --> 02:08:53.350]  like
[02:08:53.350 --> 02:08:56.790]  judge it by its smell its greasiness
[02:08:56.790 --> 02:08:58.310]  those are going to tell you that you
[02:08:58.310 --> 02:09:00.150]  have the biology you're looking for and
[02:09:00.150 --> 02:09:01.590]  then make an extract
[02:09:01.590 --> 02:09:03.430]  and throw whatever you didn't extract
[02:09:03.430 --> 02:09:05.190]  whatever's left in that bucket
[02:09:05.190 --> 02:09:07.750]  right back on top of the fucking pile
[02:09:07.750 --> 02:09:08.950]  my friend you forgot
[02:09:08.950 --> 02:09:11.670]  one thing and that's that microscope
[02:09:11.670 --> 02:09:13.510]  that we all need to learn how to use
[02:09:13.510 --> 02:09:14.550]  because then yeah you know
[02:09:15.430 --> 02:09:18.550]  I would preach that over and over and
[02:09:18.550 --> 02:09:20.550]  over again it's not hard
[02:09:20.550 --> 02:09:22.790]  you know I can teach you how to use that
[02:09:22.790 --> 02:09:24.390]  thing in one hour
[02:09:24.390 --> 02:09:28.150]  the scope is like 400 bucks to your door
[02:09:28.150 --> 02:09:30.070]  you know it's not a it's not brain
[02:09:30.070 --> 02:09:32.070]  science or rocket science but you know
[02:09:32.070 --> 02:09:33.750]  people get scared of the microscope and
[02:09:33.750 --> 02:09:34.230]  I've
[02:09:34.230 --> 02:09:36.630]  you know I've tried to get people to
[02:09:36.630 --> 02:09:37.670]  just like
[02:09:37.670 --> 02:09:41.030]  let go of that fear that oh my god this
[02:09:41.030 --> 02:09:43.590]  you know this is so complicated it's not
[02:09:43.830 --> 02:09:46.950]  I'm scared of the price
[02:09:48.870 --> 02:09:51.750]  me too me yeah it is it's a it's a
[02:09:51.750 --> 02:09:53.910]  commitment it's a few hundred bucks man
[02:09:53.910 --> 02:09:57.750]  but again you know the nose knows
[02:09:57.750 --> 02:10:00.310]  so the quickest fastest cheapest way to
[02:10:00.310 --> 02:10:01.990]  understand what you're doing
[02:10:01.990 --> 02:10:04.150]  is if it smells good if it smells like
[02:10:04.150 --> 02:10:05.430]  the fourth floor
[02:10:05.430 --> 02:10:08.950]  you got what you're looking for hey uh
[02:10:08.950 --> 02:10:10.950]  Layton you're the you're the composting
[02:10:10.950 --> 02:10:12.150]  expert here
[02:10:12.230 --> 02:10:16.310]  uh I I did have an idea that I wanted to
[02:10:16.310 --> 02:10:17.910]  shoot at somebody and see what they
[02:10:17.910 --> 02:10:19.590]  thought so what about
[02:10:19.590 --> 02:10:21.430]  you know a good old thermophilic
[02:10:21.430 --> 02:10:24.630]  compost you crank through it
[02:10:24.630 --> 02:10:28.550]  and and uh and then once it's it's
[02:10:28.550 --> 02:10:31.510]  broken through its thermophilic phase
[02:10:31.510 --> 02:10:35.830]  re-inoculating that compost with IMO
[02:10:35.830 --> 02:10:37.990]  so you don't have to that's what I've
[02:10:37.990 --> 02:10:39.430]  been doing for years
[02:10:39.430 --> 02:10:42.710]  is taking what I call green waste
[02:10:42.710 --> 02:10:44.870]  compost you know this is that commercial
[02:10:44.870 --> 02:10:45.510]  shit
[02:10:45.510 --> 02:10:47.350]  that they've cooked the fuck out of it
[02:10:47.350 --> 02:10:48.790]  broken down I mean
[02:10:48.790 --> 02:10:50.950]  they're looking to take material and
[02:10:50.950 --> 02:10:51.990]  condense it
[02:10:51.990 --> 02:10:54.630]  make it smaller that's that's what the
[02:10:54.630 --> 02:10:56.790]  green waste and these big uh composting
[02:10:56.790 --> 02:10:58.230]  companies goal is
[02:10:58.230 --> 02:11:00.470]  they don't give a shit about the biology
[02:11:00.470 --> 02:11:03.030]  they don't care that it's palm now so
[02:11:03.030 --> 02:11:04.630]  this is this is a new
[02:11:04.630 --> 02:11:06.950]  way of looking at compost you have gum
[02:11:06.950 --> 02:11:09.030]  which is ground up organic matter
[02:11:09.030 --> 02:11:11.590]  you have palm which is particulate
[02:11:11.590 --> 02:11:12.870]  organic matter
[02:11:12.870 --> 02:11:14.710]  and then at the very far end of the
[02:11:14.710 --> 02:11:17.030]  scale you have moan mineral associated
[02:11:17.030 --> 02:11:18.230]  organic matter
[02:11:18.230 --> 02:11:20.390]  so mineral associated organic matter is
[02:11:20.390 --> 02:11:22.150]  like silt it's going to last two to
[02:11:22.150 --> 02:11:24.710]  three years in the soil profile
[02:11:24.710 --> 02:11:26.470]  where palm is going to break down within
[02:11:26.470 --> 02:11:27.830]  a month or two
[02:11:27.830 --> 02:11:31.510]  so by taking that palm and re-inoculating
[02:11:31.510 --> 02:11:32.150]  it with
[02:11:32.150 --> 02:11:34.470]  with microorganisms whether it's IMO or
[02:11:34.470 --> 02:11:35.670]  fish brew or
[02:11:35.670 --> 02:11:37.030]  or you know something that you've
[02:11:37.030 --> 02:11:38.630]  created a ferment you've created
[02:11:38.630 --> 02:11:39.910]  yourself
[02:11:39.910 --> 02:11:42.390]  um it's going to turn that into a
[02:11:42.390 --> 02:11:43.590]  biological
[02:11:43.590 --> 02:11:45.990]  compost so not only will it break down
[02:11:45.990 --> 02:11:47.830]  quick provide nutrient quickly
[02:11:47.830 --> 02:11:49.750]  but you've you've inoculated with the
[02:11:49.750 --> 02:11:51.430]  biology to point also
[02:11:51.430 --> 02:11:53.510]  associated with the plant so that's
[02:11:53.510 --> 02:11:55.030]  that's what i used to do back in
[02:11:55.030 --> 02:11:56.070]  Connecticut
[02:11:56.070 --> 02:11:57.270]  on some of these really high-end
[02:11:57.270 --> 02:12:00.150]  landscapes to get that supercharged
[02:12:00.150 --> 02:12:03.110]  quick reaction uh to help the plant
[02:12:03.110 --> 02:12:03.910]  transition
[02:12:03.910 --> 02:12:06.630]  out of stress and into its new home so
[02:12:06.630 --> 02:12:08.550]  no that's a great way of doing it and
[02:12:08.870 --> 02:12:11.110]  another little trick uh Craig Tester I
[02:12:11.110 --> 02:12:13.030]  gotta give him credit for this
[02:12:13.030 --> 02:12:16.550]  was taking food scraps from the kitchen
[02:12:17.270 --> 02:12:19.910]  and putting them in water and a screen
[02:12:19.910 --> 02:12:21.350]  on top to hold them down
[02:12:21.990 --> 02:12:24.950]  so what that does is it creates a ferment
[02:12:24.950 --> 02:12:26.630]  where all of these secondary and
[02:12:26.630 --> 02:12:28.070]  tertiary metabolites
[02:12:28.630 --> 02:12:31.430]  come out of that food scrap it will not
[02:12:31.430 --> 02:12:33.590]  stink you will not have problems with
[02:12:33.590 --> 02:12:36.390]  with animals coming and and taking it
[02:12:36.390 --> 02:12:38.470]  uh so if you had to put it outside to
[02:12:38.630 --> 02:12:41.270]  avoid the smell all of that problem is
[02:12:41.270 --> 02:12:42.630]  solved with the water
[02:12:42.630 --> 02:12:44.790]  and you're basically making a ferment
[02:12:44.790 --> 02:12:47.670]  where now you can pour those secondary
[02:12:47.670 --> 02:12:49.270]  and tertiary metabolites
[02:12:49.270 --> 02:12:50.790]  right on your plant or right on your
[02:12:50.790 --> 02:12:51.750]  compost pile
[02:12:52.470 --> 02:12:55.190]  fucking shit will go crazy I mean it's a
[02:12:55.190 --> 02:12:55.830]  great
[02:12:55.830 --> 02:12:58.630]  food for biology to come out so there's
[02:12:58.630 --> 02:13:00.150]  a there's a little trick for you my
[02:13:00.150 --> 02:13:00.650]  friend
[02:13:03.750 --> 02:13:05.590]  so do you feel like you could complete
[02:13:05.590 --> 02:13:07.350]  like in my situation
[02:13:07.350 --> 02:13:10.230]  where you know we we it's hard to get a
[02:13:10.230 --> 02:13:12.870]  solid mesophilic phase because of our
[02:13:12.870 --> 02:13:13.350]  winter
[02:13:14.150 --> 02:13:16.630]  uh do you feel like you could skip that
[02:13:16.630 --> 02:13:19.110]  whole process completely by like making
[02:13:19.110 --> 02:13:21.350]  a liquid imo and really just
[02:13:21.350 --> 02:13:23.990]  inoculating that whole thing and now
[02:13:23.990 --> 02:13:25.990]  it's just ready to rock right away with
[02:13:25.990 --> 02:13:28.150]  completely skipping the mesophilic phase
[02:13:28.150 --> 02:13:29.030]  does that sound like
[02:13:30.150 --> 02:13:33.350]  well that's the mesophilic phase is when
[02:13:33.350 --> 02:13:36.230]  the bio the indigenous biology is coming
[02:13:36.230 --> 02:13:38.470]  back into it and that shit takes time
[02:13:38.470 --> 02:13:39.110]  dude
[02:13:39.110 --> 02:13:41.110]  I mean that takes a lot of fucking time
[02:13:41.110 --> 02:13:42.950]  it's nine months a year really
[02:13:43.670 --> 02:13:46.310]  you know and and even then you're not
[02:13:46.310 --> 02:13:48.230]  going to get the concentrations
[02:13:48.230 --> 02:13:50.470]  that that you could get if you just skip
[02:13:50.470 --> 02:13:52.710]  the thermophilic and bounce right into
[02:13:52.710 --> 02:13:53.910]  the mesophilic
[02:13:53.910 --> 02:13:56.070]  and then strip it using a you know a
[02:13:56.070 --> 02:13:57.510]  compost or a
[02:13:57.510 --> 02:14:00.550]  a compost extract tool of some kind like
[02:14:00.550 --> 02:14:02.230]  I've converted washing machines
[02:14:02.870 --> 02:14:06.070]  uh to to get that uh to extract
[02:14:06.070 --> 02:14:08.390]  I've also used drills I've used all
[02:14:08.390 --> 02:14:10.630]  kinds of different techniques to to
[02:14:10.630 --> 02:14:12.470]  extracting unfinished
[02:14:13.270 --> 02:14:15.990]  mesophilic compost again not going into
[02:14:15.990 --> 02:14:16.950]  thermophilic
[02:14:16.950 --> 02:14:18.550]  I love you know where I love the sweet
[02:14:18.550 --> 02:14:21.670]  spot to be 85 degrees with about 70
[02:14:21.670 --> 02:14:22.790]  percent moisture
[02:14:22.790 --> 02:14:24.870]  so when I'm squeezing it and I get just
[02:14:24.870 --> 02:14:27.190]  a little drop between each finger
[02:14:27.190 --> 02:14:29.670]  and and I have 85 degree temperature
[02:14:29.670 --> 02:14:30.790]  I've microscoped it
[02:14:31.590 --> 02:14:33.670]  fucking everything is going ballistic
[02:14:33.670 --> 02:14:35.670]  the level of predators you're getting
[02:14:36.070 --> 02:14:38.630]  is you know every every single amoeba
[02:14:38.630 --> 02:14:40.710]  was kissing they weren't really kissing
[02:14:40.710 --> 02:14:42.230]  they were splitting in half
[02:14:42.230 --> 02:14:44.950]  they were dividing that takes a fuck ton
[02:14:44.950 --> 02:14:45.750]  of time
[02:14:45.750 --> 02:14:48.230]  in nature you're talking you know a year
[02:14:48.230 --> 02:14:49.030]  and a half
[02:14:49.030 --> 02:14:50.950]  probably minimum to the point where
[02:14:50.950 --> 02:14:52.870]  you're going to get dividing at that
[02:14:52.870 --> 02:14:53.190]  level
[02:14:53.830 --> 02:14:57.030]  so yeah you can skip in your in your
[02:14:57.030 --> 02:14:57.910]  time constraint
[02:14:58.630 --> 02:15:00.870]  that is probably the best way possible
[02:15:00.870 --> 02:15:02.390]  is just you know go right into
[02:15:02.390 --> 02:15:04.310]  mesophilic don't try to heat it up
[02:15:05.110 --> 02:15:06.070]  and then do extract
[02:15:07.190 --> 02:15:07.510]  getting
[02:15:10.870 --> 02:15:11.590]  very cool
[02:15:12.630 --> 02:15:15.110]  and that food waste that food waste trick
[02:15:15.670 --> 02:15:18.230]  you you start fermenting that food waste
[02:15:18.230 --> 02:15:20.470]  and pouring that on top of your mesophilic
[02:15:20.470 --> 02:15:21.430]  compost
[02:15:21.430 --> 02:15:23.350]  you're going to get a crazy explosion
[02:15:23.350 --> 02:15:23.830]  of organs
[02:15:24.630 --> 02:15:25.830]  you're giving them everything they want
[02:15:25.830 --> 02:15:27.350]  you give them cakes and cookies and
[02:15:27.350 --> 02:15:28.150]  everything they need
[02:15:31.430 --> 02:15:33.510]  great tips man I really appreciate it
[02:15:34.870 --> 02:15:36.870]  dude my pleasure my pleasure and and
[02:15:36.870 --> 02:15:38.310]  hopefully the audience
[02:15:38.310 --> 02:15:40.150]  will have the confidence to try some of
[02:15:40.150 --> 02:15:41.830]  these too because yeah you can do this
[02:15:41.830 --> 02:15:43.350]  at home you can do it in a bin
[02:15:44.310 --> 02:15:45.830]  you know you can ferment your food in a
[02:15:45.830 --> 02:15:47.270]  bucket so it doesn't stink
[02:15:47.270 --> 02:15:49.190]  have a you know one of those plastic
[02:15:49.190 --> 02:15:51.030]  totes where the cannabis guys love to
[02:15:51.030 --> 02:15:51.750]  put their plants
[02:15:52.470 --> 02:15:53.750]  and then just throw all your greens and
[02:15:53.750 --> 02:15:55.190]  browns in there and like you said just
[02:15:55.190 --> 02:15:56.950]  collect it until you have enough
[02:15:56.950 --> 02:15:58.950]  to make a little pile off and you know
[02:15:59.910 --> 02:16:01.670]  in a vacant lot somewhere where you can
[02:16:01.670 --> 02:16:02.470]  go back and get it
[02:16:04.790 --> 02:16:07.670]  city city folks it's no joke man you got
[02:16:07.670 --> 02:16:08.950]  restrictions you got issues
[02:16:09.750 --> 02:16:11.830]  these kinds of things are difficult to
[02:16:11.830 --> 02:16:12.870]  say the least but
[02:16:12.870 --> 02:16:15.190]  with resources like your website green's
[02:16:15.190 --> 02:16:16.470]  goddess website
[02:16:16.470 --> 02:16:18.070]  now you have access to some of these
[02:16:18.070 --> 02:16:20.150]  other inputs that you can use to
[02:16:21.190 --> 02:16:23.590]  how do I say this cost effectively and
[02:16:23.590 --> 02:16:24.950]  and responsibly grow
[02:16:25.910 --> 02:16:28.310]  fucking super dang cannabis and that's
[02:16:28.310 --> 02:16:29.190]  that's why we're here
[02:16:30.150 --> 02:16:32.710]  Layton you might actually be able to
[02:16:32.790 --> 02:16:34.790]  answer this better than anybody else
[02:16:34.790 --> 02:16:36.790]  fermented mixed compost
[02:16:37.510 --> 02:16:38.710]  yeah that's what we're just talking
[02:16:38.710 --> 02:16:40.150]  about is using ferments
[02:16:40.950 --> 02:16:43.350]  to unfinished compost or finished
[02:16:43.350 --> 02:16:44.630]  compost for that matter
[02:16:45.590 --> 02:16:48.310]  and applying it to them to entice the
[02:16:48.310 --> 02:16:49.830]  the biological return
[02:16:50.790 --> 02:16:53.190]  absolutely works fantastic been doing it
[02:16:53.190 --> 02:16:53.750]  for years
[02:16:57.360 --> 02:16:59.920]  I wanted to because I think a lot of
[02:16:59.920 --> 02:17:01.360]  newer individuals are going to watch
[02:17:01.360 --> 02:17:02.960]  this because a lot of this is
[02:17:02.960 --> 02:17:04.560]  especially with your name or at least
[02:17:04.560 --> 02:17:06.080]  before we came on here your name
[02:17:06.080 --> 02:17:09.360]  with auto auto flower is a gentleman
[02:17:09.360 --> 02:17:10.800]  that lives in your neck of the woods
[02:17:10.800 --> 02:17:11.760]  Jeff Lowenfelds
[02:17:12.400 --> 02:17:14.400]  and when a lot of people ask me like
[02:17:14.400 --> 02:17:16.000]  where do you think the birthplace for
[02:17:16.560 --> 02:17:18.720]  for some of this stuff was I like to say
[02:17:18.720 --> 02:17:20.320]  well it depends you know if you're
[02:17:20.320 --> 02:17:22.560]  really just talking soil for me it was
[02:17:22.560 --> 02:17:24.640]  Dr. Lainey and but the one that was
[02:17:24.640 --> 02:17:25.520]  actually out there
[02:17:26.320 --> 02:17:28.720]  promoting it in the cannabis world was
[02:17:28.720 --> 02:17:30.480]  Jeff Lowenfelds and he's going to a lot
[02:17:30.480 --> 02:17:32.400]  of these different expos and
[02:17:32.800 --> 02:17:35.120]  breaking down things the community
[02:17:35.120 --> 02:17:37.040]  couldn't even pronounce mycorrhizal
[02:17:37.040 --> 02:17:38.880]  fungi back then and he's up there
[02:17:38.880 --> 02:17:40.560]  talking about it with slides and
[02:17:40.560 --> 02:17:43.600]  everything so I wanted to kind of
[02:17:43.600 --> 02:17:45.760]  highlight that for a moment and I don't
[02:17:45.760 --> 02:17:47.440]  know if you've read his fourth book and
[02:17:47.440 --> 02:17:48.880]  I know he's kind of breaking those
[02:17:48.880 --> 02:17:51.360]  things down but for some of those super
[02:17:51.360 --> 02:17:54.640]  new to this his first book teaming with
[02:17:54.640 --> 02:17:57.280]  microbes was a game changer for me I
[02:17:57.280 --> 02:17:58.720]  know especially when it first came out
[02:17:58.720 --> 02:18:00.400]  there's really nothing like it that
[02:18:00.400 --> 02:18:02.560]  explained it at least to the to the
[02:18:02.560 --> 02:18:04.880]  common person that you know you weren't
[02:18:04.880 --> 02:18:07.360]  necessarily like you know blatant to me
[02:18:07.360 --> 02:18:08.800]  is on another level when he's like well
[02:18:08.800 --> 02:18:10.400]  I read this white paper and I read this
[02:18:10.400 --> 02:18:12.800]  white paper a lot of that stuff's hard
[02:18:12.800 --> 02:18:14.880]  to comprehend when you're really talking
[02:18:14.880 --> 02:18:16.800]  deeper deeper knowledge on the soil
[02:18:16.800 --> 02:18:19.120]  aspects so then he had the second book
[02:18:19.120 --> 02:18:20.880]  teaming with nutrients and then teaming
[02:18:20.880 --> 02:18:23.520]  with fungi and I I believe that you know
[02:18:23.520 --> 02:18:26.080]  the time and money is is worth is
[02:18:26.080 --> 02:18:27.840]  extremely valuable but at the same time
[02:18:27.840 --> 02:18:32.720]  to get a nice a to z type understanding
[02:18:32.720 --> 02:18:34.400]  some of those books were invaluable to
[02:18:34.400 --> 02:18:36.640]  me I was wondering if you you know
[02:18:36.640 --> 02:18:38.480]  personally checked out any of that stuff
[02:18:38.480 --> 02:18:42.880]  or absolutely absolutely those those
[02:18:42.880 --> 02:18:45.120]  books gave me the foundation of
[02:18:45.120 --> 02:18:48.080]  understanding of the soil food web that
[02:18:48.080 --> 02:18:51.520]  I have currently today well that as well
[02:18:51.520 --> 02:18:54.240]  as all the fantastic information that
[02:18:54.240 --> 02:18:57.120]  you guys obviously put out with your with
[02:18:57.120 --> 02:18:59.360]  your great guests has really helped me
[02:18:59.360 --> 02:19:03.040]  along my journey and my path but but the
[02:19:03.040 --> 02:19:06.640]  the initial comprehension of what's going
[02:19:06.640 --> 02:19:09.680]  on you know in the soil and the rhizosphere
[02:19:09.680 --> 02:19:12.480]  with the you know nutritive cycling and
[02:19:12.480 --> 02:19:16.400]  all that stem from Mr. Jeff's books and
[02:19:17.520 --> 02:19:19.440]  and you know Jeff for Congress
[02:19:22.160 --> 02:19:24.240]  right on that where he's disappeared to
[02:19:24.240 --> 02:19:26.240]  are you just saying that he's running
[02:19:26.560 --> 02:19:29.600]  he's running for Congress up here in Alaska
[02:19:29.600 --> 02:19:31.760]  right now that's awesome man I don't
[02:19:31.760 --> 02:19:32.960]  think a lot of people know that he lives
[02:19:32.960 --> 02:19:34.560]  in Alaska I don't think a lot of people
[02:19:34.560 --> 02:19:37.200]  know that he's a Harvard grad and I also
[02:19:37.920 --> 02:19:40.080]  the number one little tidbit is that he's
[02:19:40.080 --> 02:19:42.640]  the longest running garden columnist in
[02:19:42.640 --> 02:19:45.360]  the country I don't think he's missed a
[02:19:45.360 --> 02:19:48.080]  week doing that as far as I know since
[02:19:48.080 --> 02:19:49.600]  then maybe now that he's running for
[02:19:49.600 --> 02:19:51.520]  Congress might have changed but he's got
[02:19:51.520 --> 02:19:53.760]  a lot of accolades that he never talks
[02:19:53.760 --> 02:19:55.680]  about it's kind of like Peter when I
[02:19:55.680 --> 02:19:59.120]  found out that he had a Grammy or a
[02:19:59.120 --> 02:20:02.080]  is that yeah Grammy I was shit backwards
[02:20:02.080 --> 02:20:05.200]  yeah man yeah as far as you know for his
[02:20:05.200 --> 02:20:07.440]  IT and his work and you know I think he
[02:20:07.440 --> 02:20:08.800]  should get another one for creating the
[02:20:08.800 --> 02:20:10.640]  future cannabis project but it's
[02:20:10.640 --> 02:20:14.640]  interesting to see when people are I
[02:20:14.640 --> 02:20:16.320]  don't know when they when they're at
[02:20:16.320 --> 02:20:17.840]  that level with accolades they never
[02:20:17.840 --> 02:20:19.680]  mention it and Jeff Loewenfels is one of
[02:20:19.680 --> 02:20:20.880]  those people and so I just wanted to
[02:20:20.880 --> 02:20:22.320]  highlight him because I think he gave a
[02:20:22.320 --> 02:20:23.760]  huge contribution since we're talking
[02:20:23.840 --> 02:20:27.040]  about Alaska for me part of living soil
[02:20:27.040 --> 02:20:29.040]  in the cannabis world started right
[02:20:29.040 --> 02:20:32.080]  there in Alaska with Jeff Loewenfels
[02:20:32.080 --> 02:20:33.680]  coming to some of the expos here in
[02:20:33.680 --> 02:20:36.400]  Denver and talking about stuff that you
[02:20:36.400 --> 02:20:40.320]  know necessarily wasn't dismissed but at
[02:20:40.320 --> 02:20:42.160]  the same time you could see like a lot of
[02:20:42.160 --> 02:20:44.240]  people in the audience kind of looking at
[02:20:44.240 --> 02:20:46.320]  each other like what is he talking about
[02:20:46.320 --> 02:20:48.240]  you know he's he's making jokes like
[02:20:48.240 --> 02:20:50.400]  using Rove beetles Karl Rove you know
[02:20:51.040 --> 02:20:52.880]  it was something that related to I think
[02:20:52.880 --> 02:20:55.280]  to the common cannabis farmer and that
[02:20:55.280 --> 02:20:56.720]  goes a long long way because you had
[02:20:56.720 --> 02:20:58.640]  mentioned some of the other brands
[02:20:58.640 --> 02:21:00.960]  Mammoth Pea and stuff and I maybe their
[02:21:00.960 --> 02:21:02.560]  heart was in the same place I don't know
[02:21:02.560 --> 02:21:05.440]  but they never had the the speaker to be
[02:21:05.440 --> 02:21:07.120]  able to articulate it to the common
[02:21:07.120 --> 02:21:11.440]  person where you know Jeff Loewenfels
[02:21:11.440 --> 02:21:13.520]  man he was he was one of the originals
[02:21:13.520 --> 02:21:16.400]  so hats off to that gentleman and if you
[02:21:16.400 --> 02:21:18.080]  never heard that name before you should
[02:21:18.080 --> 02:21:19.600]  at least buy the first book because it's
[02:21:19.600 --> 02:21:21.120]  going to be a lot easier for you to
[02:21:21.200 --> 02:21:24.000]  really understand and trust the process
[02:21:24.560 --> 02:21:27.040]  once you've read that book yeah he
[02:21:27.040 --> 02:21:29.440]  really makes it easy to ballot for sure
[02:21:31.360 --> 02:21:34.880]  in a way that's not dumbing it down but
[02:21:34.880 --> 02:21:37.120]  but you know giving you some depth but
[02:21:37.120 --> 02:21:39.040]  making it easy to understand so yeah I
[02:21:39.040 --> 02:21:41.520]  agree with you 100% Brian he really he
[02:21:41.520 --> 02:21:43.200]  really has done some wonderful things
[02:21:43.200 --> 02:21:44.880]  for for this community especially
[02:21:46.560 --> 02:21:49.040]  yeah and hats off to him you know in the
[02:21:49.040 --> 02:21:50.480]  next stage of his life because it seemed
[02:21:50.480 --> 02:21:52.320]  like he kind of fell off with some of
[02:21:52.320 --> 02:21:54.960]  that stuff right after COVID but yeah
[02:21:54.960 --> 02:21:56.960]  man he's he to me he's one of the good
[02:21:56.960 --> 02:21:59.040]  guys I even told him uh you know when I
[02:21:59.040 --> 02:22:00.240]  got to smoke with him one time in
[02:22:00.240 --> 02:22:02.400]  California like this is a this is a treat
[02:22:02.400 --> 02:22:04.480]  for me man you know sit here and smoke
[02:22:04.480 --> 02:22:07.440]  weed with you on the little hotel porch
[02:22:07.440 --> 02:22:07.920]  or whatever
[02:22:09.680 --> 02:22:11.520]  there was a question about fermenting
[02:22:11.520 --> 02:22:14.720]  vegetables in the chat so this type of
[02:22:14.720 --> 02:22:16.960]  method is doesn't matter it could be
[02:22:16.960 --> 02:22:21.040]  meat scraps it can be veggies anything
[02:22:21.040 --> 02:22:25.120]  literally and to figure out how long
[02:22:25.120 --> 02:22:27.360]  underwater that's tricky because it
[02:22:27.360 --> 02:22:29.040]  depends on your temperature if you're in
[02:22:29.040 --> 02:22:31.040]  a high temperature area it's going to go
[02:22:31.040 --> 02:22:34.640]  off quicker so by going off what's
[02:22:34.640 --> 02:22:37.200]  happening is you'll get a white kind of
[02:22:37.200 --> 02:22:40.720]  foam on the surface of the water and if
[02:22:40.720 --> 02:22:42.960]  you microscope that foam it will blow
[02:22:42.960 --> 02:22:45.760]  your fucking mind so basically what that
[02:22:45.760 --> 02:22:48.400]  is is the biology has really started to
[02:22:48.400 --> 02:22:52.880]  tear apart all of those basic foods and
[02:22:52.880 --> 02:22:55.600]  turn them into like amino acids or or
[02:22:55.600 --> 02:22:58.720]  again tertiary metabolites even further
[02:22:58.720 --> 02:23:02.720]  down the chain and so that's an indicator
[02:23:02.720 --> 02:23:05.600]  if you're using it as an inoculant it's
[02:23:05.600 --> 02:23:08.480]  time to use it if you're using it as a
[02:23:08.480 --> 02:23:11.360]  food source let that foam disappear
[02:23:11.360 --> 02:23:14.320]  everything will crash and now it'll be
[02:23:14.320 --> 02:23:16.560]  just purely metabolites so it really
[02:23:16.560 --> 02:23:18.240]  depends on how you want to use it as an
[02:23:18.240 --> 02:23:20.560]  inoculant or as a metabolite a food
[02:23:20.560 --> 02:23:23.760]  source for an option for or by all so
[02:23:23.760 --> 02:23:25.280]  hopefully I answered that question to
[02:23:25.280 --> 02:23:28.000]  the person in the audience and so late
[02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:31.040]  and as the is is that putting off a
[02:23:31.040 --> 02:23:33.360]  pretty rough smell I assume it's
[02:23:33.360 --> 02:23:35.680]  anaerobic so you can probably cat bit
[02:23:35.680 --> 02:23:38.320]  with the lid is it is it putting off a
[02:23:38.320 --> 02:23:40.720]  rough smell see that's a great fucking
[02:23:40.720 --> 02:23:43.680]  question no it's not it does like it
[02:23:43.680 --> 02:23:46.160]  doesn't have a smell the interesting
[02:23:46.160 --> 02:23:49.760]  thing is it has a funk all right so our
[02:23:49.760 --> 02:23:52.320]  nose is like taught us or protected us
[02:23:52.320 --> 02:23:54.800]  through all of our evolution like if it
[02:23:54.800 --> 02:23:56.840]  smells bad don't eat it because it's
[02:23:56.840 --> 02:23:58.320]  probably going to kill you like if you
[02:23:58.320 --> 02:24:00.520]  eat rotten meat or rotten fish you're
[02:24:00.520 --> 02:24:03.520]  going fucking down so the nose has
[02:24:03.520 --> 02:24:06.720]  taught us or helped us evolve to know
[02:24:06.720 --> 02:24:09.240]  when something smells bad that you want
[02:24:09.240 --> 02:24:11.400]  to stay away from it but if something
[02:24:11.400 --> 02:24:13.880]  smells really good you want it right
[02:24:13.880 --> 02:24:16.600]  that's why women wear perfume and men too
[02:24:16.600 --> 02:24:18.440]  for that because you're trying to
[02:24:18.440 --> 02:24:21.320]  attract other people and make them
[02:24:21.320 --> 02:24:24.360]  comfortable so when your nose picks up
[02:24:24.360 --> 02:24:26.400]  something that it doesn't know how to
[02:24:26.400 --> 02:24:29.200]  identify it kind of makes you go ooh
[02:24:29.200 --> 02:24:33.360]  what's that right it's kind of tripping
[02:24:33.360 --> 02:24:36.520]  a warning but it's not it's not saying
[02:24:36.520 --> 02:24:39.400]  stay away from it so it's kind of like a
[02:24:39.400 --> 02:24:42.320]  musky smell again it's not offensive
[02:24:42.320 --> 02:24:44.600]  but your nose doesn't know how to react
[02:24:44.600 --> 02:24:47.560]  to it and if you have that smell one now
[02:24:47.560 --> 02:24:49.320]  you know you have what we call
[02:24:49.320 --> 02:24:53.560]  biological like soup and so if you're
[02:24:53.560 --> 02:24:55.920]  trying to get inoculate like one of the
[02:24:55.920 --> 02:24:57.520]  things I taught some people out here
[02:24:57.520 --> 02:25:00.200]  about making biological compost is to
[02:25:00.200 --> 02:25:02.320]  get your greens greens and browns
[02:25:02.320 --> 02:25:04.120]  together soak your browns overnight
[02:25:04.120 --> 02:25:05.960]  because they're hydrophobic so you're
[02:25:05.960 --> 02:25:07.360]  not going to be able to get the water
[02:25:07.760 --> 02:25:10.360]  take the greens and browns two-thirds
[02:25:10.360 --> 02:25:12.280]  browns one third greens mix them
[02:25:12.280 --> 02:25:15.240]  together thoroughly and then pour on a
[02:25:15.240 --> 02:25:18.400]  seven-day ferment again making sure it's
[02:25:18.400 --> 02:25:22.080]  foamy so pour that seven-day ferment on
[02:25:22.080 --> 02:25:24.800]  top of that compost come back in 30 days
[02:25:24.800 --> 02:25:27.760]  the shit will be 85 degrees and friggin
[02:25:27.760 --> 02:25:30.880]  style and it works it works great so
[02:25:30.880 --> 02:25:32.600]  there's a you know that's another trick
[02:25:32.600 --> 02:25:35.320]  for you because you can get help is to
[02:25:35.320 --> 02:25:36.840]  you know if you're trying to jump
[02:25:36.840 --> 02:25:38.960]  build this biological compost in a
[02:25:38.960 --> 02:25:41.440]  month which you can do that's think
[02:25:41.440 --> 02:25:42.760]  that's the key to the whole thing right
[02:25:42.760 --> 02:25:46.360]  so again if you let it go beyond that
[02:25:46.360 --> 02:25:49.080]  foam to the point where the biology
[02:25:49.080 --> 02:25:52.120]  crashes now you have biological food you
[02:25:52.120 --> 02:25:58.080]  do not have a biological inoculate.
[02:25:58.080 --> 02:26:00.880]  Very cool that's very cool. Yeah and you guys
[02:26:00.880 --> 02:26:02.280]  with your short season that's going to
[02:26:02.280 --> 02:26:07.640]  help you a lot. So what's your mini gold
[02:26:07.640 --> 02:26:10.240]  nuggets dropping here guys I can't get
[02:26:10.240 --> 02:26:14.280]  to the banner fast enough. Ken behind the
[02:26:14.280 --> 02:26:17.720]  scenes are there a lot of questions? I'm
[02:26:17.720 --> 02:26:20.800]  at 31 do you guys want to do a rapid
[02:26:20.800 --> 02:26:23.560]  fire here quick a lot of them some of
[02:26:23.560 --> 02:26:25.200]  it's going to answer but we can do a
[02:26:25.200 --> 02:26:26.880]  rapid fire and get rid of it get them
[02:26:26.880 --> 02:26:29.280]  through. Yeah sure yeah I figured there
[02:26:29.280 --> 02:26:31.280]  would be and again man appreciate your
[02:26:31.280 --> 02:26:34.040]  time because I think you're exposing a
[02:26:34.040 --> 02:26:35.920]  lot of stuff especially I guess we'll
[02:26:35.920 --> 02:26:38.720]  use it like a city boy mentality of some
[02:26:38.720 --> 02:26:40.680]  ways to just really take the game to the
[02:26:40.680 --> 02:26:42.560]  next level and going out there and
[02:26:42.560 --> 02:26:44.360]  killing bears and stuff is at the top of
[02:26:44.360 --> 02:26:48.320]  the list. And Brian what were you talking
[02:26:48.320 --> 02:26:50.880]  about with his teeth what was that all
[02:26:50.880 --> 02:26:53.440]  about? I was just fucking around man
[02:26:53.440 --> 02:26:55.040]  because he seemed like such a mountain
[02:26:55.040 --> 02:26:56.280]  man that I was like look at this
[02:26:56.280 --> 02:27:02.600]  motherfucker. So obviously I was joking
[02:27:02.600 --> 02:27:04.440]  about that I thought somebody would be like for
[02:27:04.440 --> 02:27:08.640]  real. We like teasing you Brian because you
[02:27:08.640 --> 02:27:10.800]  city kids you don't have a clue what
[02:27:10.800 --> 02:27:12.880]  real life is until we get you out in the
[02:27:12.880 --> 02:27:15.160]  bush and show it to you and then you go
[02:27:15.160 --> 02:27:17.280]  holy shit you guys can live out here
[02:27:17.280 --> 02:27:21.240]  like that? I agree buddy I have city life
[02:27:21.240 --> 02:27:23.320]  so much that like pooping in the hole is
[02:27:23.320 --> 02:27:25.600]  that's probably the most terrifying to
[02:27:25.600 --> 02:27:32.000]  me of all. Well I'll tell you what man if any of you
[02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:33.960]  fellas make it up to Alaska in the
[02:27:33.960 --> 02:27:36.360]  summertime reach out I'll take you
[02:27:36.360 --> 02:27:39.480]  rafting on some epic rivers I take you
[02:27:39.480 --> 02:27:43.360]  out put you on some salmon you know the
[02:27:43.360 --> 02:27:46.400]  good old country life. Dude if I wasn't if
[02:27:46.400 --> 02:27:48.520]  I was not driving cross-country leaving
[02:27:48.520 --> 02:27:50.480]  Saturday I'd fucking make it up there
[02:27:50.480 --> 02:27:52.520]  dude so maybe next summer I'll buzz up
[02:27:52.520 --> 02:27:54.920]  there because that's my type of shit and
[02:27:54.920 --> 02:27:57.760]  I grew up on a lake in Camden Maine back
[02:27:57.760 --> 02:28:00.320]  in the you know 70s when there was not
[02:28:00.320 --> 02:28:02.960]  as many people as there was and the
[02:28:02.960 --> 02:28:05.240]  fishing was amazing you know there was
[02:28:05.240 --> 02:28:07.760]  everybody had like a little toilet
[02:28:07.760 --> 02:28:09.720]  little composter we had a group called
[02:28:09.720 --> 02:28:13.440]  not sewer system but not a septic tank
[02:28:13.440 --> 02:28:16.800]  a it's basically like a composting
[02:28:16.800 --> 02:28:19.200]  system and then they then they started
[02:28:19.200 --> 02:28:21.240]  putting in big houses and building
[02:28:21.240 --> 02:28:23.520]  fucking leach fields and fucking lake
[02:28:23.520 --> 02:28:26.520]  tanks but no I really miss fishing and
[02:28:26.520 --> 02:28:29.480]  rafting and all that shit because it's
[02:28:29.480 --> 02:28:31.440]  been a minute since I've been able to do
[02:28:31.440 --> 02:28:37.200]  that for sure anyway Ken questions yeah
[02:28:37.200 --> 02:28:39.440]  okay I'm listening to what you're saying
[02:28:39.440 --> 02:28:43.680]  okay so you know okay we got Chad Westport
[02:28:43.680 --> 02:28:45.880]  was asking does he know AK's
[02:28:45.880 --> 02:28:49.840]  bean brains up in Alaska oh hell yeah
[02:28:49.840 --> 02:28:53.520]  that's that's Dave Dave's his name AK
[02:28:53.520 --> 02:28:56.920]  bean brains he is I like to consider him
[02:28:56.920 --> 02:29:02.400]  a friend he is an amazing breeder he
[02:29:02.400 --> 02:29:05.480]  works with some really cool old-school
[02:29:05.480 --> 02:29:09.080]  lines as well as some heirloom lines and
[02:29:09.080 --> 02:29:12.640]  then you know mixes in some some modern
[02:29:12.640 --> 02:29:16.400]  some modern hype stuff as well you know
[02:29:16.400 --> 02:29:19.960]  and everything that I've grown from him
[02:29:19.960 --> 02:29:22.520]  which is you know pretty substantial I
[02:29:22.520 --> 02:29:25.000]  probably grown at least eight different
[02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:27.480]  things from him everything has been
[02:29:27.480 --> 02:29:30.720]  standout everything has been terpy
[02:29:30.720 --> 02:29:33.440]  smelly the kind of shit you just don't
[02:29:33.440 --> 02:29:38.960]  see anymore nowadays so yes yep yep
[02:29:38.960 --> 02:29:42.640]  highly recommend Dave for for photo
[02:29:42.640 --> 02:29:45.680]  period genetics and he's still you know
[02:29:45.680 --> 02:29:48.640]  small so you can contact him and buy
[02:29:48.640 --> 02:29:50.520]  directly from him if you didn't want to
[02:29:50.520 --> 02:29:52.720]  go through the seed banks and he's
[02:29:52.720 --> 02:29:56.760]  created some some really awesome lines I
[02:29:56.760 --> 02:30:01.080]  would recommend checking out his skunk
[02:30:01.080 --> 02:30:07.000]  cabbage line he's got a really cool TK
[02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:11.120]  nl5 Hayes it's all one word but
[02:30:11.120 --> 02:30:14.280]  obviously it's the triangle cush cross
[02:30:14.280 --> 02:30:17.680]  to the nl5 Hayes that Neville put out
[02:30:17.680 --> 02:30:22.040]  back in the 80s and you know he's
[02:30:22.040 --> 02:30:25.280]  isolated a few different versions of it
[02:30:25.280 --> 02:30:28.480]  the Hayes dominant the nl5 dominant
[02:30:28.480 --> 02:30:32.480]  inside the Hayes the Hayes dominant line
[02:30:32.480 --> 02:30:37.520]  there's a no ceilings Hayes Fino kind of
[02:30:37.520 --> 02:30:40.680]  like the old-school mind-wrecking nl5
[02:30:40.680 --> 02:30:43.960]  Hayes yeah I highly recommend checking
[02:30:43.960 --> 02:30:46.800]  out Dave all you guys aka beam brains
[02:30:46.800 --> 02:30:51.920]  right on right on okay so the next one
[02:30:51.920 --> 02:30:54.760]  what's the average time it takes to go
[02:30:54.760 --> 02:31:00.320]  anaerobic and get powdery mildew in K&F
[02:31:01.280 --> 02:31:04.120]  you know I don't really have an answer
[02:31:04.120 --> 02:31:07.680]  to this I'm experiencing my I just
[02:31:07.680 --> 02:31:11.200]  noticed my first powdery mildew on
[02:31:11.240 --> 02:31:15.280]  cannabis a few days ago I mean I've had
[02:31:15.280 --> 02:31:17.560]  lots on squash over the years and stuff
[02:31:17.560 --> 02:31:20.040]  like that but it's my first time on
[02:31:20.040 --> 02:31:22.640]  cannabis and I've been super busy but
[02:31:22.640 --> 02:31:26.720]  I'm gonna try to go ahead and combat it
[02:31:26.720 --> 02:31:32.160]  with a full year of IMO and LAB that's
[02:31:32.160 --> 02:31:35.560]  my plan perfect perfect and the answer
[02:31:35.560 --> 02:31:39.520]  the question it's too vague all right so
[02:31:39.560 --> 02:31:42.560]  for how long did it take something to go
[02:31:42.560 --> 02:31:46.520]  anaerobic 24 hours if you have too much
[02:31:46.520 --> 02:31:50.120]  water or if you have too much sugar or
[02:31:50.120 --> 02:31:52.880]  too much heat it can happen real fucking
[02:31:52.880 --> 02:31:56.960]  quick but in like if you're being
[02:31:56.960 --> 02:32:00.880]  responsible in your practices then you
[02:32:00.880 --> 02:32:04.520]  really should never go in a room so
[02:32:04.520 --> 02:32:06.160]  there's there's the answer to that but
[02:32:06.160 --> 02:32:09.560]  your your answer on combating powdery
[02:32:09.560 --> 02:32:12.360]  mildew fucking spot-on you'll have no
[02:32:12.360 --> 02:32:14.640]  issues with it whatsoever we used to use
[02:32:14.640 --> 02:32:16.920]  compost tea but all compost tea did was
[02:32:16.920 --> 02:32:20.680]  keep it at bay but that labs combo man
[02:32:20.680 --> 02:32:23.200]  I can done those things will fucking
[02:32:23.200 --> 02:32:25.800]  destroy that I can't imagine that
[02:32:25.800 --> 02:32:28.880]  powdery mildew that there's any way that
[02:32:28.880 --> 02:32:33.440]  it can keep up with you know lab and and
[02:32:33.440 --> 02:32:37.160]  also all the the amount of bacteria
[02:32:37.160 --> 02:32:40.200]  sponges and yeast that are that that you
[02:32:40.200 --> 02:32:42.480]  harvest from the forest I mean they're
[02:32:42.480 --> 02:32:44.560]  just gonna I mean this is my first time
[02:32:44.560 --> 02:32:46.720]  dealing with this but in my mind this is
[02:32:46.720 --> 02:32:49.160]  how I see it like I'm about to spray so
[02:32:49.160 --> 02:32:51.560]  much fucking microbes on there that
[02:32:51.560 --> 02:32:53.240]  they're going to outcompete the shit out
[02:32:53.240 --> 02:32:55.720]  of that powdery mildew oh it's the
[02:32:55.720 --> 02:32:58.440]  powery mildew toast it's food you had
[02:32:58.440 --> 02:33:02.280]  gobbled up but I'll let you guys know if
[02:33:02.400 --> 02:33:04.440]  you contact me in a couple weeks and let
[02:33:04.440 --> 02:33:06.480]  me know how it worked out for me I could
[02:33:06.480 --> 02:33:10.800]  be wrong but never know all right when
[02:33:10.800 --> 02:33:13.360]  do you know it's not going to grow now
[02:33:13.360 --> 02:33:15.080]  this is definitely a reference to the
[02:33:15.080 --> 02:33:17.240]  auto flowers we were talking about in
[02:33:17.240 --> 02:33:22.200]  the beginning of the show oh man is you
[02:33:22.200 --> 02:33:25.840]  should be seeing growth every day if if
[02:33:25.840 --> 02:33:28.680]  you're in bed so you know auto flowers
[02:33:28.680 --> 02:33:32.440]  generally if if you got a nice clean
[02:33:32.440 --> 02:33:35.640]  transplant and everything works out they
[02:33:35.640 --> 02:33:37.400]  should usually start you should start
[02:33:37.400 --> 02:33:41.640]  seeing pre flowers day 21 that's usually
[02:33:41.640 --> 02:33:44.640]  how it works and if you're not getting
[02:33:44.640 --> 02:33:48.000]  auto flowers grow fast I mean genetics
[02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:52.440]  do play a you know a role in it if a
[02:33:52.440 --> 02:33:55.400]  little tent breeder breeds a one-foot
[02:33:55.520 --> 02:33:59.200]  auto with you know you know another one
[02:33:59.200 --> 02:34:02.160]  foot auto guaranteed all the progeny is
[02:34:02.160 --> 02:34:05.400]  going to be one foot tall as well so if
[02:34:05.400 --> 02:34:07.840]  you know that you're growing genetics
[02:34:07.840 --> 02:34:10.560]  from somebody that knows what they're
[02:34:10.560 --> 02:34:13.680]  doing and is doing it right then you
[02:34:13.680 --> 02:34:18.000]  should be seeing growth every day and
[02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:20.960]  and nothing makes me feel more
[02:34:20.960 --> 02:34:24.120]  inadequate than a stunted auto so I'll
[02:34:24.120 --> 02:34:27.800]  kill those suckers so fast and I don't
[02:34:27.800 --> 02:34:29.760]  even want to look at them for two days
[02:34:29.760 --> 02:34:31.800]  longer than I have to because it makes
[02:34:31.800 --> 02:34:34.560]  me feel like you know like I don't know
[02:34:34.560 --> 02:34:38.240]  what I'm doing so compost and then you
[02:34:38.240 --> 02:34:42.880]  know start over so yes if you're I I
[02:34:42.880 --> 02:34:45.280]  would say if you're new to this and
[02:34:45.280 --> 02:34:48.480]  you're after you know let's say two
[02:34:48.480 --> 02:34:50.680]  weeks two weeks and you're getting very
[02:34:50.680 --> 02:34:53.880]  minimal growth you're hitting the 21 day
[02:34:53.960 --> 02:34:55.840]  mark and you're still sitting like six
[02:34:55.840 --> 02:34:59.040]  to ten inches tall you stunted it I mean
[02:34:59.040 --> 02:35:02.280]  there's no way around it you can stun it
[02:35:02.280 --> 02:35:04.040]  from giving too high of a nutrient
[02:35:04.040 --> 02:35:07.360]  solution too young if you got a seedling
[02:35:07.360 --> 02:35:10.560]  and you're you know you get the
[02:35:10.560 --> 02:35:13.360]  cotyledons just opened up and you got
[02:35:13.360 --> 02:35:15.880]  your first true leaves and you hit it
[02:35:15.880 --> 02:35:18.000]  with the nutrient solution even if it's
[02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:20.760]  very weak guaranteed you're gonna stunt
[02:35:20.760 --> 02:35:23.000]  that plant you know like don't even
[02:35:23.040 --> 02:35:25.480]  start feeding it till it's like on its
[02:35:25.480 --> 02:35:27.760]  third or fourth node and when you do
[02:35:27.760 --> 02:35:32.920]  start small and and yeah but I would say
[02:35:32.920 --> 02:35:35.320]  two two to three weeks if you're not
[02:35:35.320 --> 02:35:37.240]  noticing any growth man then you got a
[02:35:37.240 --> 02:35:39.400]  stunted auto and it's up to you decide
[02:35:39.400 --> 02:35:41.760]  if you want to ride it out or if you
[02:35:41.760 --> 02:35:44.240]  want to you know get rid of it and start
[02:35:44.240 --> 02:35:57.840]  over yeah well I'm used to talking to
[02:35:57.880 --> 02:36:02.120]  myself anyway right anyway did anybody
[02:36:02.120 --> 02:36:03.640]  else have anything that they wanted to
[02:36:03.640 --> 02:36:07.400]  add on that question I think that's good
[02:36:07.400 --> 02:36:12.920]  advice just you know call it okay I like
[02:36:12.920 --> 02:36:17.160]  to hear about his lighting regimen too
[02:36:17.160 --> 02:36:20.760]  well outside we're almost 24 hours of
[02:36:20.760 --> 02:36:24.440]  sunlight so that's kind of nice but uh
[02:36:24.440 --> 02:36:30.120]  but yeah inside you know standard I'm
[02:36:30.120 --> 02:36:33.640]  running LEDs high efficiency LEDs
[02:36:33.640 --> 02:36:38.760]  through veg I'm probably running 25% as
[02:36:38.760 --> 02:36:41.840]  through transition I might be bumping it
[02:36:41.840 --> 02:36:45.040]  up to you know transition to early flower
[02:36:45.040 --> 02:36:49.360]  like 50% and then as we're moving into
[02:36:49.360 --> 02:36:52.720]  you know well into flower you know
[02:36:52.760 --> 02:36:55.600]  creeping it up and then by the last
[02:36:55.600 --> 02:36:58.440]  like three to four weeks of flower I'm
[02:36:58.440 --> 02:37:01.680]  at a hundred percent and that obviously
[02:37:01.680 --> 02:37:04.560]  depends by your fixture because you know
[02:37:04.560 --> 02:37:08.160]  every fixture has different recommended
[02:37:08.160 --> 02:37:12.480]  hanging heights and unless you are just
[02:37:12.480 --> 02:37:14.880]  going based off manufacturer
[02:37:14.880 --> 02:37:17.760]  recommendations then you're gonna need a
[02:37:17.760 --> 02:37:20.360]  par meter to know how high to set your
[02:37:20.360 --> 02:37:24.560]  stuff and and yeah but other than that
[02:37:24.560 --> 02:37:27.680]  it's a good old I always veg 18 six and
[02:37:27.680 --> 02:37:33.560]  I always flower on 12 12 granted if I
[02:37:33.560 --> 02:37:36.680]  was growing a long flowering sativa
[02:37:36.680 --> 02:37:39.200]  something that I know is gonna be you
[02:37:39.200 --> 02:37:41.240]  know well 12 weeks I don't consider that
[02:37:41.240 --> 02:37:48.080]  long you know 14 16 20 weeks then I
[02:37:48.120 --> 02:37:53.280]  would start those seedlings under 11
[02:37:53.280 --> 02:37:55.880]  hours of light and 13 hours of darkness
[02:37:55.880 --> 02:38:00.240]  and they would never get a veg period so
[02:38:00.240 --> 02:38:03.120]  that's about all I got for for lighting
[02:38:03.120 --> 02:38:05.720]  schedules how about what are you what are
[02:38:05.720 --> 02:38:07.480]  you coloring are you playing the spectrum
[02:38:07.480 --> 02:38:11.960]  at all you know reds and blues no that's
[02:38:11.960 --> 02:38:15.640]  that's above my my knowledge level yet I
[02:38:15.760 --> 02:38:18.240]  just got the full spectrum LED lights
[02:38:18.240 --> 02:38:21.000]  and I'll tell you what man I love them
[02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:24.120]  the plants look so beautiful under them
[02:38:24.120 --> 02:38:26.160]  unless you're you know for years we're
[02:38:26.160 --> 02:38:30.440]  like Oh metal halide for veg and HPS for
[02:38:30.440 --> 02:38:34.960]  you know flower and and you know it's
[02:38:34.960 --> 02:38:36.600]  just it's tough to look at these
[02:38:36.600 --> 02:38:39.760]  beautiful plants under HPS so at the
[02:38:39.760 --> 02:38:42.120]  minimum I would say you know go like
[02:38:42.120 --> 02:38:45.160]  half HPS half metal halide to get a nice
[02:38:45.160 --> 02:38:48.560]  wide spectrum going on so you're so
[02:38:48.560 --> 02:38:50.960]  your plants if anything just so your
[02:38:50.960 --> 02:38:54.720]  plants look are easier to look at but
[02:38:54.720 --> 02:38:57.520]  now I haven't experimented with any reds
[02:38:57.520 --> 02:39:01.680]  or blues I have heard that that
[02:39:01.680 --> 02:39:05.480]  introduce and this is from the man dr.
[02:39:05.480 --> 02:39:08.880]  MJ Coco himself who's a lighting expert
[02:39:08.880 --> 02:39:11.200]  who I get a lot of my lighting knowledge
[02:39:11.200 --> 02:39:15.640]  from that the adding red light early on
[02:39:15.640 --> 02:39:20.960]  and veg can initiate like we'll get like
[02:39:20.960 --> 02:39:24.400]  more of a stretch going on so but all
[02:39:24.400 --> 02:39:26.120]  that's beyond my pay grade I haven't
[02:39:26.120 --> 02:39:31.920]  messed with any UV or just the basic LED
[02:39:31.920 --> 02:39:35.280]  full spectrums and and stuff along those
[02:39:35.280 --> 02:39:37.600]  lines so so in other words you don't
[02:39:37.760 --> 02:39:41.120]  like to look at pink plants oh I like
[02:39:41.120 --> 02:39:44.840]  pink plants purple colored plants yeah
[02:39:44.840 --> 02:39:46.840]  well colorblind right I don't really
[02:39:46.840 --> 02:39:48.840]  care what color it is as long as it
[02:39:48.840 --> 02:39:52.800]  looks good smokes better right okay how
[02:39:52.800 --> 02:39:56.720]  many generations need to be bred to
[02:39:56.720 --> 02:40:00.400]  solidly phenol and genetics I had at
[02:40:00.400 --> 02:40:06.480]  least nine solidify sorry I think he's
[02:40:06.480 --> 02:40:10.800]  probably soon talking about inbreeding
[02:40:10.800 --> 02:40:17.680]  to to knock down phenotypic variation so
[02:40:17.680 --> 02:40:21.200]  you're so your f1 generation is going to
[02:40:21.200 --> 02:40:23.800]  be spread out a little bit you know
[02:40:23.800 --> 02:40:25.760]  you're going to have phenos from the mom
[02:40:25.760 --> 02:40:29.520]  the dad the mix what what have you your
[02:40:29.520 --> 02:40:34.440]  f2 generation is going to have way wider
[02:40:34.480 --> 02:40:37.440]  phenotypical variation you're going to
[02:40:37.440 --> 02:40:39.760]  start seeing grandparents you're gonna
[02:40:39.760 --> 02:40:41.800]  start seeing combinations of all of
[02:40:41.800 --> 02:40:46.400]  those and then the further you inbreed
[02:40:46.400 --> 02:40:50.480]  it the the tighter the that phenotypic
[02:40:50.480 --> 02:40:52.800]  variation is going to be however you
[02:40:52.800 --> 02:40:56.160]  will start to come across you know some
[02:40:56.160 --> 02:40:59.200]  inbreeding depression which might
[02:40:59.200 --> 02:41:02.400]  exhibit in certain ways but if you're
[02:41:02.400 --> 02:41:05.520]  talking about wanting a true IBL
[02:41:05.520 --> 02:41:12.200]  something that's 100% uniform you know I
[02:41:12.200 --> 02:41:14.600]  don't even know what you'd have to take
[02:41:14.600 --> 02:41:19.880]  it probably f10 f11 maybe but but I
[02:41:19.880 --> 02:41:22.920]  think a good range would be like I like
[02:41:22.920 --> 02:41:27.160]  the f4 to maybe like f6 range and and
[02:41:27.160 --> 02:41:30.840]  you start losing some stuff to in
[02:41:30.840 --> 02:41:33.600]  breeding depression I personally feel
[02:41:33.600 --> 02:41:38.000]  like after maybe the f7 range so I guess
[02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:40.800]  it just depends those inbred lines like
[02:41:40.800 --> 02:41:43.640]  that though they make excellent
[02:41:43.640 --> 02:41:46.600]  outcrossing tools so you might be
[02:41:46.600 --> 02:41:49.000]  experiencing some inbreeding depression
[02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:52.200]  here and there but if you were to take
[02:41:52.200 --> 02:41:57.200]  that inbred line and outcross it to
[02:41:57.240 --> 02:42:01.920]  another inbred line what you have is a
[02:42:01.920 --> 02:42:05.800]  true f1 most of what is grown on the
[02:42:05.800 --> 02:42:08.320]  market these days and people label it as
[02:42:08.320 --> 02:42:11.000]  f1 because we haven't really figured out
[02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:14.320]  a way to like denote what generation
[02:42:14.320 --> 02:42:18.600]  of filial breeding it's at you know but
[02:42:18.600 --> 02:42:20.800]  it's really truly they're polyhybrids
[02:42:20.800 --> 02:42:23.720]  they're not f1 they're not you know
[02:42:23.720 --> 02:42:26.200]  they're they're just a good old plain
[02:42:26.240 --> 02:42:30.960]  polyhybrid but if you inbreed a line and
[02:42:30.960 --> 02:42:33.520]  then cross it to another inbred line you
[02:42:33.520 --> 02:42:36.440]  can get some really solid stuff you're
[02:42:36.440 --> 02:42:38.440]  going to start experiencing something
[02:42:38.440 --> 02:42:43.600]  called heterosis which is hybrid vigor
[02:42:43.600 --> 02:42:45.840]  so your plants are going to grow way
[02:42:45.840 --> 02:42:49.520]  faster you know the end of it the plant
[02:42:49.520 --> 02:42:51.920]  itself might be experiencing like
[02:42:51.920 --> 02:42:54.600]  certain traits from the inbreeding
[02:42:54.640 --> 02:42:56.440]  depression but as soon as you outcross
[02:42:56.440 --> 02:42:58.720]  it all that goes away and then and
[02:42:58.720 --> 02:43:01.200]  that's when the real magic happens and
[02:43:01.200 --> 02:43:03.600]  there isn't many people in the cannabis
[02:43:03.600 --> 02:43:05.240]  industry that's doing this kind of
[02:43:05.240 --> 02:43:08.000]  breeding because it takes time it takes
[02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:11.360]  money it takes space you know you're
[02:43:11.360 --> 02:43:13.320]  almost breeding towards something that
[02:43:13.320 --> 02:43:15.240]  isn't going to be as good because you're
[02:43:15.240 --> 02:43:18.880]  breeding it so far you know so it's
[02:43:18.880 --> 02:43:21.080]  pretty rare but this is how it's it's
[02:43:21.080 --> 02:43:24.080]  done and in agriculture itself that I
[02:43:24.120 --> 02:43:26.680]  mean it's just it's the way it's done
[02:43:26.680 --> 02:43:28.320]  it's the way it's been done for
[02:43:28.320 --> 02:43:32.360]  hundreds of years so yeah I would say
[02:43:32.360 --> 02:43:37.480]  take it to at least an f4 to like f6 or
[02:43:37.480 --> 02:43:39.400]  f7 to really have something that's
[02:43:39.400 --> 02:43:42.080]  tighter but still isn't really losing a
[02:43:42.080 --> 02:43:43.600]  whole lot of qualities to inbreeding
[02:43:43.600 --> 02:43:46.540]  depression.
[02:43:46.540 --> 02:43:50.180]  Layton did you I saw you move there was
[02:43:50.180 --> 02:43:52.740]  that just for Poe? Yeah I'm trying to keep
[02:43:52.740 --> 02:43:55.220]  him calm getting on to three hours and
[02:43:55.220 --> 02:44:01.700]  it's playtime. Okay my autos are five
[02:44:01.700 --> 02:44:04.980]  weeks old and about a foot tall and on
[02:44:04.980 --> 02:44:09.340]  the on the third leaves have I
[02:44:09.340 --> 02:44:15.340]  beeped up. You can say fuck on YouTube
[02:44:15.340 --> 02:44:18.700]  kid. I know but you know I try to beep
[02:44:18.700 --> 02:44:21.700]  polite. His wife's sitting right there.
[02:44:21.700 --> 02:44:24.540]  Damn right there's a two by four close
[02:44:24.540 --> 02:44:31.180]  by. I would say something went wrong
[02:44:31.180 --> 02:44:34.140]  there you I mean I don't want you to
[02:44:34.140 --> 02:44:36.100]  feel bad like I was saying at the very
[02:44:36.100 --> 02:44:40.220]  beginning you know growing autos isn't
[02:44:40.220 --> 02:44:43.500]  easy there's just no way to slice it
[02:44:43.500 --> 02:44:45.220]  like there's such a thin margin for
[02:44:45.220 --> 02:44:49.220]  transplant. It sounds like you
[02:44:49.220 --> 02:44:50.900]  might have did something wrong I don't
[02:44:50.900 --> 02:44:54.420]  know you could have not applied enough
[02:44:54.420 --> 02:44:58.580]  calcium, magnesium, if you're in cocoa. I
[02:44:58.580 --> 02:45:00.340]  mean there's so many factors but it
[02:45:00.340 --> 02:45:04.020]  sounds like you're not achieving a
[02:45:04.020 --> 02:45:07.940]  perfect growth rate unless the breeder
[02:45:07.940 --> 02:45:10.820]  was breeding small autos then maybe it's
[02:45:10.820 --> 02:45:13.860]  it's right up to standard. There's so
[02:45:13.860 --> 02:45:15.780]  many factors that would play into
[02:45:15.780 --> 02:45:19.180]  answering that question. I think that
[02:45:19.180 --> 02:45:21.300]  played more into also back to Green's
[02:45:21.300 --> 02:45:23.380]  question I think a lot of that stuff
[02:45:23.380 --> 02:45:24.820]  unless it's some of the genetics you
[02:45:24.820 --> 02:45:27.020]  had mentioned today that stuff just not
[02:45:27.020 --> 02:45:29.180]  up to par to what you're probably used
[02:45:29.180 --> 02:45:32.020]  to and your grows normally so I think
[02:45:32.020 --> 02:45:35.220]  genetics matter obviously in any any
[02:45:35.220 --> 02:45:36.980]  environment but especially when you're
[02:45:36.980 --> 02:45:40.660]  doing autos I think it's the time and
[02:45:40.660 --> 02:45:42.580]  effort put into researching the the
[02:45:42.580 --> 02:45:43.460]  breeder that you're going to purchase
[02:45:43.620 --> 02:45:45.740]  from is well worth it on the front end
[02:45:45.740 --> 02:45:46.900]  instead of figuring that shit on the
[02:45:46.900 --> 02:45:49.900]  back end. Know your source. Know your
[02:45:49.900 --> 02:45:52.540]  source. Well I'll go ahead and drop a
[02:45:52.540 --> 02:45:54.700]  gold bar real quick for new breeders or
[02:45:54.700 --> 02:45:56.860]  new growers if you're just getting into
[02:45:56.860 --> 02:46:00.260]  this you know go ahead avoid all the
[02:46:00.260 --> 02:46:03.780]  modern-day polyhybridized type because
[02:46:03.780 --> 02:46:06.860]  you're going to get a hundred different
[02:46:06.860 --> 02:46:10.060]  phenos over half of them are going to
[02:46:10.060 --> 02:46:12.220]  have intersex issues no matter what
[02:46:12.260 --> 02:46:14.740]  these breeders are saying you need a
[02:46:14.740 --> 02:46:18.220]  skip autos go out get yourself a tried
[02:46:18.220 --> 02:46:20.860]  and true like get yourself Northern
[02:46:20.860 --> 02:46:23.660]  Lights or you know get yourself one of
[02:46:23.660 --> 02:46:26.220]  these easy growing cultivars that will
[02:46:26.220 --> 02:46:29.340]  grow itself you know like doesn't matter
[02:46:29.340 --> 02:46:32.020]  what you do that shit's gonna grow it's
[02:46:32.020 --> 02:46:34.980]  gonna yield like just get confident with
[02:46:34.980 --> 02:46:37.620]  working with the plant you can like learn
[02:46:37.620 --> 02:46:40.580]  water how much to water these plants
[02:46:40.620 --> 02:46:43.500]  like you know start start small start
[02:46:43.500 --> 02:46:45.140]  with something that's not going to be so
[02:46:45.140 --> 02:46:47.820]  finicky otherwise you're going to be
[02:46:47.820 --> 02:46:49.660]  over watering you're going to have
[02:46:49.660 --> 02:46:53.340]  nanners at week three because you know
[02:46:53.340 --> 02:46:54.980]  you're stressing the shit out of these
[02:46:54.980 --> 02:46:58.100]  plants and it's one of them poly
[02:46:58.100 --> 02:46:59.900]  hybridized crap that's going around
[02:46:59.900 --> 02:47:02.220]  nowadays get something tried and true
[02:47:02.220 --> 02:47:05.220]  that's easy to grow mess with that do
[02:47:05.220 --> 02:47:07.460]  that for a few rounds till you're
[02:47:07.460 --> 02:47:09.260]  comfortable with the plant you know how
[02:47:09.260 --> 02:47:11.220]  to water you kind of know how to feed
[02:47:11.220 --> 02:47:14.780]  and then maybe you can start you know
[02:47:14.780 --> 02:47:17.740]  reaching out and and trying some of the
[02:47:17.740 --> 02:47:21.180]  these modern variety I guess it's not a
[02:47:21.180 --> 02:47:24.020]  variety but these modern cultivars and
[02:47:24.020 --> 02:47:26.940]  and playing around and and seeing what
[02:47:26.940 --> 02:47:30.940]  you can get and eventually you know you
[02:47:30.940 --> 02:47:35.020]  know switch to autos but you know I see
[02:47:35.020 --> 02:47:36.940]  so many people that are growing these
[02:47:37.100 --> 02:47:41.220]  these six inch one foot autos and I love
[02:47:41.220 --> 02:47:43.100]  it I love to see people grow and and
[02:47:43.100 --> 02:47:45.740]  they're super proud and it's really rad
[02:47:45.740 --> 02:47:48.780]  to see that you know but if they had got
[02:47:48.780 --> 02:47:52.060]  a year of experience growing a fucking
[02:47:52.060 --> 02:47:54.540]  stout photo period that's just bomb
[02:47:54.540 --> 02:47:56.900]  proof it's going to grow no matter what
[02:47:56.900 --> 02:47:58.380]  you're going to do like Northern Lights
[02:47:58.380 --> 02:48:00.740]  and Northern Lights 5 is a great example
[02:48:00.740 --> 02:48:04.460]  of that and you know then then you can
[02:48:04.460 --> 02:48:06.020]  really develop some of these skills
[02:48:06.020 --> 02:48:09.900]  that'll take you far and and branching
[02:48:09.900 --> 02:48:15.070]  out after that so that's really good
[02:48:15.070 --> 02:48:16.590]  advice man especially you know
[02:48:16.590 --> 02:48:18.990]  successful flips are just more
[02:48:18.990 --> 02:48:21.750]  fulfilling in general than trying to
[02:48:21.750 --> 02:48:23.790]  grow the greatest hype and barely get
[02:48:23.790 --> 02:48:26.030]  you know survive by trying to figure
[02:48:26.030 --> 02:48:28.350]  things out and it's it's kind of weird
[02:48:28.350 --> 02:48:30.030]  like there's some of this stuff's full
[02:48:30.030 --> 02:48:32.190]  circle here in Denver now where people
[02:48:32.190 --> 02:48:34.350]  are you know coming into Denver and it
[02:48:34.350 --> 02:48:35.390]  seems like more in the underground
[02:48:35.390 --> 02:48:37.670]  market they want the blue dreams they
[02:48:37.670 --> 02:48:39.270]  want the golden goat some of the stuff
[02:48:39.270 --> 02:48:41.270]  that was kind of like giggled at you
[02:48:41.270 --> 02:48:42.950]  know just a few years ago is now making
[02:48:42.950 --> 02:48:45.670]  a comeback because more individuals on
[02:48:45.670 --> 02:48:48.590]  the east coast seem to maybe have heard
[02:48:48.590 --> 02:48:50.470]  of obviously blue dreams or golden goat
[02:48:50.470 --> 02:48:52.110]  compared to some of the others Northern
[02:48:52.110 --> 02:48:54.630]  Lights was another good example. Blue
[02:48:54.630 --> 02:48:56.510]  Dream is a great cultivar it grows
[02:48:56.510 --> 02:49:00.190]  itself the shit stacks I've seen I
[02:49:00.190 --> 02:49:02.750]  worked on a farm that had you know 12
[02:49:02.750 --> 02:49:06.270]  foot trees, colas the size of my leg and
[02:49:06.270 --> 02:49:09.070]  I mean it really it's a it's a strong
[02:49:09.070 --> 02:49:11.590]  genetic that grows itself people talk a
[02:49:11.590 --> 02:49:13.510]  lot of shit on it but I consider that a
[02:49:13.510 --> 02:49:17.870]  top-notch genetic in my book. Yeah a lot
[02:49:17.870 --> 02:49:19.750]  of a lot of fakery out there with that
[02:49:19.750 --> 02:49:21.630]  one so you definitely need to know your
[02:49:21.630 --> 02:49:24.550]  source with that but it was kind of cool
[02:49:24.550 --> 02:49:26.430]  because it checked all the boxes for you
[02:49:26.430 --> 02:49:28.550]  know you paying the mortgage and
[02:49:28.550 --> 02:49:30.550]  somebody was willing to come back and
[02:49:30.550 --> 02:49:32.590]  ask you for it where most people always
[02:49:32.670 --> 02:49:34.630]  wanted whatever the new newest shit was
[02:49:34.630 --> 02:49:37.070]  man don't bring me anything that you
[02:49:37.070 --> 02:49:38.710]  brought me beforehand it's like damn
[02:49:38.710 --> 02:49:42.350]  this takes a while to do bro.
[02:49:43.550 --> 02:49:46.550]  Okay well let's get done now we still
[02:49:46.550 --> 02:49:48.390]  got 30 questions because I keep finding
[02:49:48.390 --> 02:49:50.950]  more coming in but future cannabis
[02:49:50.950 --> 02:49:53.990]  project what if your neighbor less than
[02:49:53.990 --> 02:49:56.190]  a hundred feet away is growing males in
[02:49:56.190 --> 02:49:59.390]  his yard and you're growing females what
[02:49:59.430 --> 02:50:04.030]  do you do? Oh I would I would talk to
[02:50:04.030 --> 02:50:06.830]  your neighbor and I would ask him maybe
[02:50:06.830 --> 02:50:09.630]  to set his plants on the far side of his
[02:50:09.630 --> 02:50:11.790]  property and then maybe you can set
[02:50:11.790 --> 02:50:13.790]  yours on the far side of yours you know
[02:50:13.790 --> 02:50:16.190]  just reach out kind of you know to be
[02:50:16.190 --> 02:50:18.510]  respectful as you know ask him where
[02:50:18.510 --> 02:50:21.070]  he's keeping them and and just politely
[02:50:21.070 --> 02:50:23.190]  let him know like hey man what you're
[02:50:23.190 --> 02:50:24.790]  doing over here like you're trying to
[02:50:24.790 --> 02:50:26.430]  grow some medicine and you don't want to
[02:50:26.430 --> 02:50:29.550]  cross pollinate and then maybe just try
[02:50:29.550 --> 02:50:32.350]  to work together and see if you can get
[02:50:32.350 --> 02:50:35.230]  your plants situated as far away as
[02:50:35.230 --> 02:50:38.390]  possible but also make sure like if the
[02:50:38.390 --> 02:50:40.550]  wind is blowing a general direction
[02:50:40.550 --> 02:50:42.350]  through that property you know
[02:50:42.350 --> 02:50:44.550]  consistently every day which oftentimes
[02:50:44.550 --> 02:50:46.910]  happens make sure you got your females
[02:50:46.910 --> 02:50:49.910]  upwind of the of the males so they're
[02:50:49.910 --> 02:50:51.950]  not catching pollen on the wind and
[02:50:51.950 --> 02:50:53.310]  working way down and pollinate your
[02:50:53.310 --> 02:50:57.430]  plants. Buy them a pollen protection
[02:50:57.430 --> 02:50:59.830]  there's there's these bags that you can
[02:50:59.830 --> 02:51:01.110]  put right over the top of the plant
[02:51:01.110 --> 02:51:03.030]  shuts the pollen right the fuck down.
[02:51:03.030 --> 02:51:08.630]  Nice. Okay that one is definitely gold
[02:51:08.630 --> 02:51:11.590]  laden thank you very much for that sir
[02:51:11.590 --> 02:51:13.910]  because we need those ones definitely
[02:51:13.910 --> 02:51:16.630]  so let's jump. Yeah they make it in rolls
[02:51:16.630 --> 02:51:18.870]  and in bags you just got to hunt it down
[02:51:18.870 --> 02:51:22.470]  but I think it comes from over there
[02:51:23.430 --> 02:51:25.590]  because they do a lot of breeding and
[02:51:25.590 --> 02:51:27.230]  they can't have they they had to be able
[02:51:27.230 --> 02:51:31.630]  to protect themselves. Right on so
[02:51:31.630 --> 02:51:34.950]  what's your method for fermenting kelp?
[02:51:34.950 --> 02:51:37.550]  So I've done multiple different ways say
[02:51:37.550 --> 02:51:40.150]  we harvest some fresh kelp off the off
[02:51:40.150 --> 02:51:43.390]  the beach bring it back maybe chop it up
[02:51:43.390 --> 02:51:45.990]  a little bit mix weigh it out say you
[02:51:45.990 --> 02:51:50.470]  got you know a thousand grams of kelp
[02:51:50.510 --> 02:51:53.630]  mix it with a thousand grams of brown
[02:51:53.630 --> 02:51:59.750]  sugar mix it up put it in a jar you want
[02:51:59.750 --> 02:52:01.350]  to start with a bigger jar it's gonna
[02:52:01.350 --> 02:52:06.190]  break down you know so leave headspace
[02:52:06.190 --> 02:52:09.790]  you know leave like you want to leave I
[02:52:09.790 --> 02:52:11.950]  don't know maybe two-thirds headspace or
[02:52:11.950 --> 02:52:14.590]  something cover it with a breathable lid
[02:52:14.590 --> 02:52:17.070]  so what I always use mason jars we do a
[02:52:17.070 --> 02:52:19.430]  lot of canning around here so we got
[02:52:19.590 --> 02:52:22.190]  lots of that so I'll put a paper towel
[02:52:22.190 --> 02:52:25.390]  over the mason jar and use the ring the
[02:52:25.390 --> 02:52:27.830]  ring will hold the paper towel allow gas
[02:52:27.830 --> 02:52:32.790]  exchange so that ferments for seven days
[02:52:32.790 --> 02:52:35.790]  then you pull off the liquid the liquid
[02:52:35.790 --> 02:52:40.030]  is what would be considered a ferment
[02:52:40.030 --> 02:52:42.590]  FPGA one could say even though
[02:52:42.590 --> 02:52:45.390]  technically FPGA materials harvested
[02:52:45.390 --> 02:52:47.710]  before dawn when the dew still on the
[02:52:47.710 --> 02:52:50.470]  leaves I still call that an FPGA so and
[02:52:50.470 --> 02:52:52.550]  I would use it like an FPGA another
[02:52:52.550 --> 02:52:54.470]  thing that I've done successfully with
[02:52:54.470 --> 02:52:57.910]  kelp would be to rehydrate kelp meal
[02:52:57.910 --> 02:53:03.910]  last winter my I used up all my fermented
[02:53:03.910 --> 02:53:06.950]  plant juices one of them had gone bad
[02:53:06.950 --> 02:53:12.070]  we're buried and crazy winter high snows
[02:53:12.070 --> 02:53:15.030]  and I there's nowhere to get fresh
[02:53:15.030 --> 02:53:18.070]  material so I did a little experiment
[02:53:18.070 --> 02:53:21.910]  and I rehydrated some kelp mere kelp
[02:53:21.910 --> 02:53:25.230]  meal with a light beer just like we do
[02:53:25.230 --> 02:53:28.310]  when we're making oh h and we have fresh
[02:53:28.310 --> 02:53:30.470]  herbs and dried herbs and we rehydrate
[02:53:30.470 --> 02:53:33.030]  the dried herbs with light beer so
[02:53:33.030 --> 02:53:34.550]  that's what I do with my kelp meal I
[02:53:34.550 --> 02:53:37.390]  soaked it for like two days poured off
[02:53:37.390 --> 02:53:40.150]  the extra beer weighed out what I had
[02:53:40.150 --> 02:53:42.550]  mixed it with equal weights brown sugar
[02:53:42.550 --> 02:53:44.630]  and fermented it and it came out the
[02:53:44.630 --> 02:53:47.150]  same I mean maybe not as nice as fresh
[02:53:47.150 --> 02:53:49.270]  as good but I'll tell you what I
[02:53:49.270 --> 02:53:51.590]  corrected some trace mineral deficiencies
[02:53:51.590 --> 02:53:54.390]  no problem with it so I do know that it
[02:53:54.390 --> 02:53:57.070]  works and you know it might not be ideal
[02:53:57.070 --> 02:53:58.910]  but use what you have especially if
[02:53:58.910 --> 02:54:11.980]  you're buried in winter so I wonder if
[02:54:11.980 --> 02:54:14.380]  this questions along the lines of what
[02:54:14.380 --> 02:54:18.900]  you were saying about to the compost
[02:54:18.900 --> 02:54:22.300]  yeah it sure looks like it so bottom
[02:54:22.300 --> 02:54:24.100]  line I call it a ferment because it
[02:54:24.100 --> 02:54:26.180]  really technically is although what I'm
[02:54:26.180 --> 02:54:28.740]  using is water and sunlight so basically
[02:54:28.740 --> 02:54:30.860]  it's just throw the kelp in a bucket put
[02:54:30.860 --> 02:54:33.100]  some kind of weight on the top of it any
[02:54:33.100 --> 02:54:34.820]  part of the plant that gets above the
[02:54:34.820 --> 02:54:36.940]  surface of the water will dry out and
[02:54:36.940 --> 02:54:39.260]  turn hard and you'll lose the benefit of
[02:54:39.260 --> 02:54:42.100]  it and then let it sit in the hot Sun
[02:54:42.100 --> 02:54:44.420]  until you see a white foam on the top
[02:54:44.420 --> 02:54:46.940]  then it's biologically active that's the
[02:54:46.940 --> 02:54:49.980]  time to use it as a bio inoculant if you
[02:54:49.980 --> 02:54:52.100]  want to use it as a biological food let
[02:54:52.100 --> 02:54:54.500]  that crash till that foam is completely
[02:54:54.500 --> 02:54:56.860]  gone so there's there's the hopefully
[02:54:56.860 --> 02:55:02.700]  answer that one so when are you pulling
[02:55:02.700 --> 02:55:04.980]  out any invasive species from your
[02:55:04.980 --> 02:55:08.380]  ferments and your FPJ's are you using
[02:55:08.380 --> 02:55:10.540]  them for the nutrients that they're
[02:55:10.540 --> 02:55:15.580]  offering the only invasive species I
[02:55:15.580 --> 02:55:17.140]  know around here are pike and our
[02:55:17.140 --> 02:55:19.860]  creeks and rivers everything else is
[02:55:19.860 --> 02:55:22.660]  really just natural and going and growing
[02:55:22.660 --> 02:55:26.100]  and what I found works best is a lot of
[02:55:26.100 --> 02:55:28.660]  the stuff things that we're overlooking
[02:55:28.660 --> 02:55:30.620]  you know things that are weeds things
[02:55:30.620 --> 02:55:32.620]  that we get so used to looking at you
[02:55:32.620 --> 02:55:36.420]  know lambs quarter dandelion plantain
[02:55:36.420 --> 02:55:41.380]  horsetail chickweed you know just
[02:55:41.380 --> 02:55:45.700]  oftentimes like those those weeds you
[02:55:45.700 --> 02:55:49.980]  know are pretty nutrient dense and can
[02:55:49.980 --> 02:55:53.060]  be used used with great success for
[02:55:53.060 --> 02:55:56.700]  ferment so so yeah but also if you have
[02:55:56.700 --> 02:55:58.940]  an invasive species that's taken over
[02:55:58.940 --> 02:56:03.260]  your yard or whatever you know you you
[02:56:03.260 --> 02:56:05.140]  know maybe you don't want to ferment
[02:56:05.140 --> 02:56:07.700]  that unless you know that your yards
[02:56:07.700 --> 02:56:09.900]  like a nice healthy ecosystem where
[02:56:10.020 --> 02:56:11.900]  you know you got a healthy soil
[02:56:11.900 --> 02:56:14.020]  otherwise I would just take those
[02:56:14.020 --> 02:56:17.500]  invasive species dig them up throw them
[02:56:17.500 --> 02:56:20.140]  in your compost and use something that
[02:56:20.140 --> 02:56:22.740]  is nice and healthy from your forest
[02:56:22.740 --> 02:56:32.020]  system to make your FPJ's you're muted
[02:56:32.020 --> 02:56:35.300]  but again I know and I was trying to fix
[02:56:35.300 --> 02:56:37.340]  his mic because he keeps getting an echo
[02:56:37.340 --> 02:56:39.220]  so I have to keep going to his mic
[02:56:39.220 --> 02:56:43.140]  settings but that's cool so FAA can be
[02:56:43.260 --> 02:56:46.180]  made with fresh or saltwater fish I
[02:56:46.180 --> 02:56:48.540]  think we answered it but please do it
[02:56:48.540 --> 02:56:51.980]  again yep yep use whatever use what you
[02:56:51.980 --> 02:56:54.540]  have available don't let you know the
[02:56:54.540 --> 02:56:57.700]  lack of you know deep-sea saltwater fish
[02:56:57.700 --> 02:57:01.380]  affect you from making FAA but the
[02:57:01.380 --> 02:57:03.620]  traditional KNF recipe definitely calls
[02:57:03.620 --> 02:57:08.060]  for blueback deep-sea fish you know and
[02:57:08.060 --> 02:57:10.540]  so but use what you got you know if
[02:57:10.540 --> 02:57:12.180]  you're taking your kid out fishing and
[02:57:12.180 --> 02:57:14.420]  you catch a fish and you you know you
[02:57:14.420 --> 02:57:17.620]  take the fillets off and take that
[02:57:17.620 --> 02:57:19.980]  little scrap or carcass you have and
[02:57:19.980 --> 02:57:22.580]  throw it in a mason jar or something and
[02:57:22.580 --> 02:57:24.500]  ferment it up it's gonna work it's gonna
[02:57:24.500 --> 02:57:26.980]  have nutritional benefits it might not
[02:57:26.980 --> 02:57:29.260]  be right up to the traditional KNF
[02:57:29.260 --> 02:57:32.620]  standards but it'll get the job done
[02:57:32.620 --> 02:57:36.220]  okay now people are wanting to know if
[02:57:36.220 --> 02:57:38.180]  they can use their hair as a slow
[02:57:38.180 --> 02:57:40.260]  release fertilizer I know it's got gold
[02:57:40.380 --> 02:57:43.700]  in it I don't know the answer to that
[02:57:43.700 --> 02:57:46.100]  one I had heard someone talking about
[02:57:46.100 --> 02:57:48.820]  collecting hair from a hair salon and
[02:57:48.820 --> 02:57:51.020]  using it as a fertilizer I never chased
[02:57:51.020 --> 02:57:52.620]  that rabbit hole down but I thought it
[02:57:52.620 --> 02:57:54.580]  was kind of interesting because we do
[02:57:54.580 --> 02:57:56.260]  know you can find out everything that
[02:57:56.260 --> 02:57:58.820]  the person's been consuming because it's
[02:57:58.820 --> 02:58:00.500]  stored in the air I just don't
[02:58:00.500 --> 02:58:02.620]  understand you know how to break that
[02:58:02.620 --> 02:58:04.300]  back down again but there is something
[02:58:04.300 --> 02:58:08.380]  to it I this might be embarrassing but
[02:58:08.380 --> 02:58:09.740]  I've been playing around with that using
[02:58:09.740 --> 02:58:11.780]  hair and cutting my fingernails and
[02:58:11.780 --> 02:58:13.820]  stuff and it seems like it takes
[02:58:13.820 --> 02:58:16.100]  probably six months but then the
[02:58:16.100 --> 02:58:17.940]  decomposers start to break the hair and
[02:58:17.940 --> 02:58:21.220]  the fingernails down the springtails have
[02:58:21.220 --> 02:58:25.820]  to be there as well right on Brian so
[02:58:25.820 --> 02:58:29.220]  how do you use a kiln for this process
[02:58:29.220 --> 02:58:30.940]  now I believe they're talking about
[02:58:30.940 --> 02:58:34.820]  making the WCP or the water soluble
[02:58:34.820 --> 02:58:39.780]  phosphate mm-hmm yeah well I don't know
[02:58:39.780 --> 02:58:41.460]  much about killing because I don't make
[02:58:41.460 --> 02:58:44.740]  pottery and stuff but I know that for
[02:58:44.740 --> 02:58:47.820]  it for the WCA the oven itself works
[02:58:47.820 --> 02:58:51.220]  pretty great it'll emit a bit of a funky
[02:58:51.220 --> 02:58:53.060]  odor but it dissipates pretty quickly
[02:58:53.060 --> 02:58:56.580]  within the hour you know I set it to 400
[02:58:56.580 --> 02:58:59.100]  degrees and maybe cook it for an hour so
[02:58:59.100 --> 02:59:01.620]  I don't know I've tried experimenting
[02:59:01.620 --> 02:59:05.380]  with going down to 375 or maybe 350 and
[02:59:05.380 --> 02:59:08.020]  and different time rates and stuff like
[02:59:08.020 --> 02:59:11.100]  that and I haven't really found one
[02:59:11.100 --> 02:59:13.980]  perfect way but it seems like an hour
[02:59:13.980 --> 02:59:18.660]  hour is generally good as to the the the
[02:59:18.660 --> 02:59:21.740]  bones whatever you're gonna cook that in
[02:59:21.740 --> 02:59:25.300]  is gonna impart a very smell that you
[02:59:25.300 --> 02:59:29.420]  will come to know as phosphorus calcium
[02:59:29.420 --> 02:59:32.940]  phosphate so the first time I made that
[02:59:32.940 --> 02:59:36.380]  stuff I actually did it in our cast-iron
[02:59:36.380 --> 02:59:38.820]  Dutch oven that you know we used to make
[02:59:38.820 --> 02:59:40.780]  bread out of my wife won't use it
[02:59:40.780 --> 02:59:46.500]  anymore so yeah that's why I say like
[02:59:46.500 --> 02:59:49.260]  outside on the on you know on the grill
[02:59:49.260 --> 02:59:52.100]  works great because that smell ends up
[02:59:52.100 --> 02:59:54.420]  just dissipating off into the you know
[02:59:54.420 --> 02:59:58.500]  atmosphere or whatnot but but yeah so if
[02:59:58.500 --> 03:00:01.340]  you're looking to cook up some bones in
[03:00:01.340 --> 03:00:03.780]  your kiln you know it might end up
[03:00:03.780 --> 03:00:06.580]  making it smell that way but you know
[03:00:06.580 --> 03:00:11.700]  use what you got so hey Ken I got a
[03:00:11.700 --> 03:00:14.540]  bounce like quickly is there anything
[03:00:14.540 --> 03:00:17.980]  any one question stands out that you
[03:00:17.980 --> 03:00:20.780]  need my attention on or tonight bow out
[03:00:20.780 --> 03:00:25.300]  I think my friend you can go run away
[03:00:25.300 --> 03:00:26.980]  and take pull for a walk and have a
[03:00:26.980 --> 03:00:28.460]  cigarette I'm not seeing anything
[03:00:28.460 --> 03:00:30.940]  directly that only you could answer that
[03:00:30.940 --> 03:00:33.420]  I can see up off the top here awesome
[03:00:33.420 --> 03:00:35.660]  alright guys thank you so much brother
[03:00:35.660 --> 03:00:37.300]  for coming on today giving us three
[03:00:37.300 --> 03:00:40.380]  hours Brian can always a pleasure seeing
[03:00:40.380 --> 03:00:42.660]  you guys and I'll see you next week from
[03:00:42.660 --> 03:00:45.580]  the road man hey man is an honor getting
[03:00:45.580 --> 03:00:48.140]  to meet you late and and sit here and
[03:00:48.140 --> 03:00:50.260]  chat with you it's a pretty cool
[03:00:50.260 --> 03:00:52.220]  experience so you have a good rest of
[03:00:52.220 --> 03:00:54.180]  your day all right thank you very much
[03:00:54.180 --> 03:00:55.740]  and appreciate the love brother thank
[03:00:55.780 --> 03:00:59.140]  you all right peace out everybody right
[03:00:59.140 --> 03:01:06.780]  on it and drive safe okay so um I'll go
[03:01:06.780 --> 03:01:08.860]  back to the start and there's 80 on the
[03:01:08.860 --> 03:01:10.980]  live feed that I haven't even looked at
[03:01:10.980 --> 03:01:13.460]  so guys you know we'll just finish up
[03:01:13.460 --> 03:01:15.660]  some questions and then Brian O'Brien is
[03:01:15.660 --> 03:01:19.340]  a busy man too and I'm sure our Alaskan
[03:01:19.340 --> 03:01:21.940]  friend needs that you know go get
[03:01:21.940 --> 03:01:24.140]  something from the forest that he needs
[03:01:24.140 --> 03:01:27.780]  for his KNF so let's go with question
[03:01:27.780 --> 03:01:30.980]  does the soluble phosphorus in a full
[03:01:30.980 --> 03:01:34.700]  your feed discourage micro arousal
[03:01:34.700 --> 03:01:38.580]  relationships you know what I hadn't
[03:01:38.580 --> 03:01:40.620]  heard of that but Layton just mentioned
[03:01:40.620 --> 03:01:42.620]  something earlier in this conversation
[03:01:42.620 --> 03:01:44.420]  that it is possible for that to happen
[03:01:44.420 --> 03:01:46.260]  even if you're full your feet and you're
[03:01:46.260 --> 03:01:48.180]  going heavy he was mentioning that it
[03:01:48.180 --> 03:01:50.460]  can roll off the foliage and land in the
[03:01:50.460 --> 03:01:54.060]  soil and have some kind of implications
[03:01:54.220 --> 03:01:57.580]  along those lines but to be honest I
[03:01:57.580 --> 03:02:00.380]  don't have the the knowledge or the
[03:02:00.380 --> 03:02:03.580]  resource to really resources to really
[03:02:03.580 --> 03:02:08.100]  be able to confirm or deny that so I use
[03:02:08.100 --> 03:02:10.740]  my cries on every single transplant and
[03:02:10.740 --> 03:02:16.900]  I also water in WCAP all the time in
[03:02:16.900 --> 03:02:19.660]  flower when it's too late late and
[03:02:19.660 --> 03:02:22.060]  flowering to foliar I'm just root
[03:02:22.100 --> 03:02:24.860]  drenching it so if it's destroying those
[03:02:24.860 --> 03:02:28.780]  my car eyes all fungal networks in there
[03:02:28.780 --> 03:02:32.700]  you know I haven't noticed it yet right
[03:02:32.700 --> 03:02:35.460]  right now I think this next question
[03:02:35.460 --> 03:02:38.460]  probably you can't even make an FAA out
[03:02:38.460 --> 03:02:40.220]  of a bear meat because you need the it's
[03:02:40.220 --> 03:02:42.500]  a fish amino acid bear wouldn't have the
[03:02:42.500 --> 03:02:46.740]  same biology in it at all you know you
[03:02:46.740 --> 03:02:52.740]  can I recently heard from a buddy that
[03:02:52.740 --> 03:02:58.220]  that knew a lady over in Korea who who
[03:02:58.220 --> 03:03:02.260]  firm her ferments animals so it's super
[03:03:02.260 --> 03:03:05.860]  hardcore way to go about it it can be
[03:03:05.860 --> 03:03:11.780]  done but you know I'm gonna never know
[03:03:11.780 --> 03:03:15.500]  yeah okay well that's a beautiful answer
[03:03:15.500 --> 03:03:17.260]  I never figured that would be possible
[03:03:17.260 --> 03:03:21.340]  so that's a gold guys Dean family farms
[03:03:21.340 --> 03:03:23.260]  I like to know your thoughts on using
[03:03:23.260 --> 03:03:25.660]  can't have ferments to steer crops
[03:03:25.660 --> 03:03:28.460]  towards a developmental phase for
[03:03:28.460 --> 03:03:31.260]  example fermenting flowering plants to
[03:03:31.260 --> 03:03:34.460]  encourage more flowers on your tomatoes
[03:03:34.460 --> 03:03:36.860]  yeah I mean that's kind of built into
[03:03:36.860 --> 03:03:39.020]  the philosophy of KNF you know with our
[03:03:39.020 --> 03:03:41.660]  fermented fruit juice you know with our
[03:03:41.660 --> 03:03:43.580]  fermented plant juice we're harvesting
[03:03:43.580 --> 03:03:45.580]  stuff early in the season that's in its
[03:03:45.580 --> 03:03:48.380]  vegetative growth and it's it's filled
[03:03:48.380 --> 03:03:50.740]  with all these these hormones that are
[03:03:50.740 --> 03:03:53.660]  really produced that that are encouraging
[03:03:53.660 --> 03:03:57.980]  growth and whatnot so so yeah that's why
[03:03:57.980 --> 03:04:01.380]  generally FPJs have been considered like
[03:04:01.380 --> 03:04:03.900]  a veg plant food even though it's used
[03:04:03.900 --> 03:04:06.020]  the entire life of the plant from the
[03:04:06.020 --> 03:04:08.500]  beginning to end it's always the base
[03:04:08.500 --> 03:04:10.900]  however the hormones that are in there
[03:04:11.020 --> 03:04:16.220]  can encourage you know that initial that
[03:04:16.220 --> 03:04:18.700]  initial veg growth as well as the
[03:04:18.700 --> 03:04:20.740]  fermented fruit juice by you know
[03:04:20.740 --> 03:04:23.780]  fermenting these fruits that are that
[03:04:23.780 --> 03:04:26.780]  are well within their their ripening
[03:04:26.780 --> 03:04:30.460]  phase it's got hormones and and stuff
[03:04:30.460 --> 03:04:32.340]  that are being locked in these ferments
[03:04:32.340 --> 03:04:36.780]  that can encourage you know ripening and
[03:04:36.780 --> 03:04:39.500]  and stuff along those lines so yeah the
[03:04:39.620 --> 03:04:41.460]  those ideas that you just asked about
[03:04:41.460 --> 03:04:46.660]  are kind of built into the KNF system so
[03:04:46.660 --> 03:04:51.860]  fantastic fantastic so ferment old buds
[03:04:51.860 --> 03:04:55.380]  or JLF old buds what would be your
[03:04:55.380 --> 03:05:00.260]  preferred method yeah guys is you know
[03:05:00.260 --> 03:05:03.060]  we keep using the acronyms so maybe we
[03:05:03.060 --> 03:05:05.100]  should actually break them down for
[03:05:05.100 --> 03:05:08.140]  people once in a while too I haven't
[03:05:08.140 --> 03:05:12.260]  ever tried fermenting buds but you know
[03:05:12.260 --> 03:05:15.660]  it makes me wonder the fermentation
[03:05:15.660 --> 03:05:19.180]  oftentimes only yields as much product
[03:05:19.180 --> 03:05:21.580]  as there is liquid within those cell
[03:05:21.580 --> 03:05:23.780]  walls so if you've gone through and
[03:05:23.780 --> 03:05:28.540]  dried your buds out and then the amount
[03:05:28.540 --> 03:05:31.900]  of you know usable liquid you're going
[03:05:31.900 --> 03:05:34.420]  to yield off that will probably be slim
[03:05:34.460 --> 03:05:38.660]  so in that case I would go with the JLF
[03:05:38.660 --> 03:05:41.820]  JADAM liquid ferment so you know take
[03:05:41.820 --> 03:05:44.100]  your one gallon bucket or whatever and
[03:05:44.100 --> 03:05:46.580]  put your half pound of weed that might
[03:05:46.580 --> 03:05:49.500]  started go bad or mold or whatever and
[03:05:49.500 --> 03:05:53.060]  then top it off with water and then you
[03:05:53.060 --> 03:05:55.460]  know go the good old JLF route and
[03:05:55.460 --> 03:05:57.620]  you'll mitigate the the lack of moisture
[03:05:57.620 --> 03:06:00.860]  and lack of yield that you would get
[03:06:00.860 --> 03:06:04.420]  from fermenting it KNF style just like
[03:06:04.420 --> 03:06:06.580]  leaves cannabis leaves you know people
[03:06:06.580 --> 03:06:09.180]  try to make you know FPJs out of
[03:06:09.180 --> 03:06:11.620]  cannabis leaves and and the yield that
[03:06:11.620 --> 03:06:13.820]  the yield of usable liquid you're
[03:06:13.820 --> 03:06:16.420]  gonna get off that it's just not
[03:06:16.420 --> 03:06:19.780]  effective enough so cannabis leaves as
[03:06:19.780 --> 03:06:22.940]  well work better in a JLF JADAM liquid
[03:06:22.940 --> 03:06:26.260]  ferment if you ask me all right on right
[03:06:26.260 --> 03:06:28.580]  on Brian wake up over there buddy I'm
[03:06:28.580 --> 03:06:30.620]  not even seeing you take notes man that
[03:06:30.740 --> 03:06:34.620]  last dab did you or what bro it did and
[03:06:34.620 --> 03:06:37.020]  I'm seeing my phone blowing up so I'm
[03:06:37.020 --> 03:06:38.860]  probably peeking over there to make sure
[03:06:38.860 --> 03:06:42.820]  that okay well hey why we're a few
[03:06:42.820 --> 03:06:44.540]  minutes over already there are more
[03:06:44.540 --> 03:06:46.180]  questions there's a hundred and thirty
[03:06:46.180 --> 03:06:49.100]  four live comments but I think probably
[03:06:49.100 --> 03:06:53.740]  Brian needs to go I blessings you guys
[03:06:53.740 --> 03:06:55.980]  like I love this I love coming on and
[03:06:55.980 --> 03:06:57.820]  learning and helping and sharing and
[03:06:57.820 --> 03:07:00.460]  Brian brother if it wasn't for you and
[03:07:00.540 --> 03:07:03.500]  Leighton and Peter you know none of us
[03:07:03.500 --> 03:07:05.980]  would be here right now especially Peter
[03:07:05.980 --> 03:07:09.260]  but how do you guys feel do you want to
[03:07:09.260 --> 03:07:11.180]  carry on or do you want to want to shut
[03:07:11.180 --> 03:07:14.460]  her down yeah we need to shut her down
[03:07:14.460 --> 03:07:16.260]  man so I can be respectful to my wife's
[03:07:16.260 --> 03:07:20.260]  time with but yeah we uh you know the
[03:07:20.260 --> 03:07:22.460]  nice thing is we're gonna have you come
[03:07:22.460 --> 03:07:24.700]  back our guest even yesterday I mean
[03:07:24.700 --> 03:07:26.140]  there's just so much information that
[03:07:26.140 --> 03:07:28.020]  you dropped so shout out to the guests
[03:07:28.020 --> 03:07:29.700]  both this week man you guys are sitting
[03:07:29.700 --> 03:07:33.660]  here I know for a fact that if you're
[03:07:33.660 --> 03:07:35.020]  newer to this you're gonna have to
[03:07:35.020 --> 03:07:36.820]  watch this several times to just catch
[03:07:36.820 --> 03:07:38.180]  all of the things that you guys are
[03:07:38.180 --> 03:07:40.380]  casually kind of saying in a three-hour
[03:07:40.380 --> 03:07:42.300]  conversation because a lot of that stuff
[03:07:42.300 --> 03:07:44.780]  is tried and true from experience so
[03:07:44.780 --> 03:07:46.260]  instead of somebody saying like oh I
[03:07:46.260 --> 03:07:48.700]  feel this way or it's like hey I've done
[03:07:48.700 --> 03:07:50.620]  it and these are the reasons why I'm now
[03:07:50.620 --> 03:07:54.820]  doing it this way definitely well like I
[03:07:54.820 --> 03:07:57.620]  said the late and man is an honor to be
[03:07:57.620 --> 03:07:58.980]  able to come on the show I've been
[03:07:58.980 --> 03:08:01.340]  watching the show for years and to be
[03:08:01.340 --> 03:08:03.020]  able to sit here with you guys and shoot
[03:08:03.020 --> 03:08:05.500]  the shit and talk about this stuff is it
[03:08:05.500 --> 03:08:07.500]  feels really cool to me and I appreciate
[03:08:07.500 --> 03:08:09.260]  you reaching out Brian and asking me to
[03:08:09.260 --> 03:08:11.220]  come on the show and I'll tell you what
[03:08:11.220 --> 03:08:13.260]  it's been fun getting on here and
[03:08:13.260 --> 03:08:16.100]  chatting with you guys and you know I'd
[03:08:16.100 --> 03:08:17.740]  definitely be into doing it again in the
[03:08:17.740 --> 03:08:21.300]  future sometime and yeah man good times

[03:08:26.180 --> 03:08:28.620]  we always like to say I mean three hours
[03:08:28.620 --> 03:08:30.500]  is intimidating for a lot of people so
[03:08:30.500 --> 03:08:31.900]  behind the scenes you know some of the
[03:08:31.900 --> 03:08:33.180]  individuals you think would be like
[03:08:33.180 --> 03:08:35.540]  pretty receptive to it they don't want
[03:08:35.540 --> 03:08:36.860]  to do it unless they didn't know the
[03:08:36.860 --> 03:08:39.340]  questions and stuff and I were just
[03:08:39.340 --> 03:08:40.860]  never gonna do the show that way you
[03:08:40.860 --> 03:08:42.260]  know you just well I'll tell you what I
[03:08:42.260 --> 03:08:43.980]  told my wife I was a little nervous
[03:08:43.980 --> 03:08:46.420]  about going on there you know it's a
[03:08:46.420 --> 03:08:49.300]  three-hour show she's like oh shit you
[03:08:49.300 --> 03:08:53.100]  can talk about this stuff for ten hours
[03:08:53.100 --> 03:08:55.660]  you're right yeah man you live in and
[03:08:55.660 --> 03:08:57.500]  breathe it and that's why it's fun to
[03:08:57.500 --> 03:08:59.020]  interview gentlemen like yourself is
[03:08:59.020 --> 03:09:01.180]  just a wealth of knowledge that you can
[03:09:01.180 --> 03:09:03.980]  find out in just three hours and like
[03:09:03.980 --> 03:09:06.420]  JD and Canadian says the northern
[03:09:06.420 --> 03:09:08.380]  perspective is great you're in an
[03:09:08.380 --> 03:09:11.740]  environment that's extremely harsh and
[03:09:11.740 --> 03:09:14.420]  you're creating something in that
[03:09:14.420 --> 03:09:17.020]  environment to feed your family your
[03:09:17.020 --> 03:09:20.460]  soul and and to medicate yourself and
