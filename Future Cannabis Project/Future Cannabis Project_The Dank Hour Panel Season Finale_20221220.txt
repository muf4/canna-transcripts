[00:01.400 --> 00:09.320]  Hello, hello, hello everybody and welcome to the season finale, season two, year two
[00:09.320 --> 00:10.720]  of the Dank Hour panel.
[00:10.720 --> 00:12.240]  It has been an awesome time.
[00:12.240 --> 00:14.080]  We've had a lot of fun coming and going.
[00:14.080 --> 00:19.020]  We've had a lot of people come, a lot of people go, a lot of people let us know about some
[00:19.020 --> 00:20.480]  really amazing things going on.
[00:20.480 --> 00:24.240]  We're going to have an awesome conversation, hopefully have some amazing guests that have
[00:24.240 --> 00:25.240]  been throughout the year.
[00:25.240 --> 00:30.560]  We're going to have, of course, our usual Dank Hour panel of Dank Hour guests and panelists
[00:30.560 --> 00:34.280]  and we'll be talking with them about all the awesome things going on in their space
[00:34.280 --> 00:37.560]  as well, catching up before things get rolling.
[00:37.560 --> 00:42.520]  It should be a busy night, so we won't press it for any longer.
[00:42.520 --> 00:46.840]  I mean, I got to rethink my whole tagline for the new year because I keep going to say
[00:46.840 --> 00:51.240]  dictator of dialogue and that's just not going to work out properly.
[00:51.240 --> 00:54.160]  It's been a slow evolution and apparently a degradation into that.
[00:54.160 --> 00:57.720]  So we're going to move on and find something new and fun to say in the new year.
[00:57.720 --> 01:05.280]  I'm excited because when you look back at it, we've had two years of the Dank Hour
[01:05.280 --> 01:06.280]  panel.
[01:06.280 --> 01:09.960]  I mean, a year and three quarters of the Dank Hour panel.
[01:09.960 --> 01:12.120]  We've produced a ton of content.
[01:12.120 --> 01:18.280]  We've covered everything from cooking with cannabis to cooking with cannabis, regenerative
[01:18.280 --> 01:28.880]  agriculture, consumption tools, hemp, banking and cannabis, safety science, Unicorn Cup,
[01:28.880 --> 01:33.440]  events, small businesses, marketing, everything.
[01:33.440 --> 01:37.840]  We've tried to really support the community as much as possible, give every aspect of
[01:37.840 --> 01:41.280]  the community that needs to be necessarily supported and looked into and looked at everybody
[01:41.280 --> 01:48.160]  from small business owners to larger business owners to help everyone move along and really
[01:48.240 --> 01:53.360]  just kind of have some fun and have some great conversation and bring that conversation to
[01:53.360 --> 01:57.120]  you every day, every Tuesday here on the Dank Hour.
[01:57.120 --> 01:59.200]  And what we're going to do is get into that right now.
[01:59.200 --> 02:04.440]  And first off, because I haven't heard from Dr. Anubis in a good long while, you're going
[02:04.440 --> 02:09.440]  to be our first hello and hi, how are you doing?
[02:09.440 --> 02:11.840]  Hi, how are you doing and what's going on with you?
[02:11.840 --> 02:12.840]  How have you been?
[02:12.840 --> 02:15.360]  How is your year gone thus far?
[02:15.360 --> 02:17.000]  What were some highlights?
[02:17.000 --> 02:21.520]  Do you have a favorite episode that you watch throughout the year that people should look
[02:21.520 --> 02:22.520]  back on?
[02:24.920 --> 02:31.520]  You know, I don't remember what I did yesterday, so thinking back on all the episodes is damn
[02:31.520 --> 02:33.840]  near impossible for me, by the way.
[02:33.840 --> 02:35.160]  Hi, I'm Anna Schwab.
[02:35.160 --> 02:43.320]  I am a, you know, cannabis researcher, scientist and just, you know, that's what I do.
[02:43.560 --> 02:50.120]  And I'm in New Jersey and I'm working with a company that uses aquaponic methods to grow
[02:50.120 --> 02:56.160]  both hemp and soon we will be growing THC type plants.
[02:56.160 --> 02:57.520]  And it's all organic.
[02:57.520 --> 02:59.840]  And so we have some pretty tight restrictions.
[02:59.840 --> 03:05.040]  We don't add anything in other than fish poop and we don't take anything out other than,
[03:05.040 --> 03:06.440]  you know, the plants.
[03:06.440 --> 03:07.440]  So that's me.
[03:07.440 --> 03:11.560]  But yeah, like I don't remember very many episodes, but I have to say that I really
[03:11.600 --> 03:19.920]  enjoyed Dr. James White talking about the endophytic fungi.
[03:19.920 --> 03:22.960]  It has a special name and I can't remember what it is right now.
[03:22.960 --> 03:25.240]  I like that so much.
[03:25.240 --> 03:26.240]  What was it?
[03:27.080 --> 03:28.080]  Rhizophage.
[03:28.080 --> 03:30.280]  Rhizophage cycle.
[03:30.280 --> 03:31.280]  Yep.
[03:31.280 --> 03:39.000]  I like that so much that I drove down the road to Rutgers University and met with him
[03:39.120 --> 03:40.440]  and his grad student.
[03:40.440 --> 03:47.800]  And we're going to set up an experiment in our hemp house to test a hypothesis that they
[03:47.800 --> 03:48.800]  have.
[03:48.800 --> 03:51.800]  So that was really, really cool.
[03:51.800 --> 03:53.280]  Or that is really, really cool.
[03:53.280 --> 03:57.960]  It's going to be really, really cool going forward when we get to do this experiment
[03:57.960 --> 04:01.760]  because I'm like super stoked about it.
[04:01.760 --> 04:07.160]  And so I guess that was a highlight.
[04:07.200 --> 04:11.240]  So I think I think I know what your favorite episode was when it comes to what you're passionate
[04:11.240 --> 04:12.240]  about.
[04:12.240 --> 04:15.400]  But tell me if I'm wrong and tell me if something else rings a bell.
[04:15.400 --> 04:19.120]  But I think you had a lot of fun with Dr. Philip Henry and talking about scientific
[04:19.120 --> 04:20.120]  breeding.
[04:20.120 --> 04:23.200]  You guys got really passionate on that episode, I believe.
[04:23.200 --> 04:30.680]  I remember him being on the show and I remember that he was on the show.
[04:30.680 --> 04:32.680]  I have no idea.
[04:32.680 --> 04:37.120]  Honestly, like my memory is so bad.
[04:38.080 --> 04:41.480]  And I have talked to Philip like outside of the Dank Hour, too.
[04:41.480 --> 04:49.600]  So it's hard for me to like remember what was Dank Hour versus what was, you know, our
[04:49.600 --> 04:50.600]  conversations.
[04:50.600 --> 04:57.600]  I also had him I contacted him when Ashley was trying to Ashley, who used to be on the
[04:57.600 --> 04:58.600]  Dank Hour.
[04:58.600 --> 04:59.600]  I don't know if she'll show up or not.
[04:59.600 --> 05:02.720]  She's doing things.
[05:02.720 --> 05:07.760]  But for rare systems, they were trying to figure out like how to do marketing and trying
[05:07.760 --> 05:11.640]  to figure out terp profile groups.
[05:11.640 --> 05:14.440]  And I was like, I know who you should talk to.
[05:14.440 --> 05:17.240]  And so I put her in contact with Philip.
[05:17.240 --> 05:25.000]  And so he helped them with that with all their data and was like, here's how you know, I
[05:25.000 --> 05:26.000]  see these groups going.
[05:26.000 --> 05:31.900]  But yeah, that was I mean, he's always fun to talk to.
[05:31.900 --> 05:32.900]  That was awesome.
[05:32.900 --> 05:35.540]  Do we get acknowledgement if the paper happens?
[05:35.540 --> 05:36.540]  Um.
[05:36.540 --> 05:41.020]  Yes, I can do it and acknowledgement.
[05:41.020 --> 05:42.660]  Yeah, for sure.
[05:42.660 --> 05:47.780]  So well, OK, just saying because one of the remember when we started the episode, Dr.
[05:47.780 --> 05:53.500]  Anna has been like with us, like since like the first episode, you've maybe missed like
[05:53.500 --> 05:57.380]  five episodes altogether before you even came on the Dank Hour.
[05:57.380 --> 06:01.420]  Yeah, man, because there was a little bit of an episode of a show before me.
[06:01.420 --> 06:03.180]  And so which is crazy.
[06:03.180 --> 06:11.500]  So that's that's a fucking lot of Dank Hour episodes when it comes to it.
[06:11.500 --> 06:13.780]  I like talking about cannabis, man.
[06:13.780 --> 06:17.380]  But when we got rolling, one of the things that I remember saying when we got rolling
[06:17.380 --> 06:21.940]  together and we were we were like having scientists and farmers together and a lot of the conversations
[06:21.940 --> 06:23.420]  like we tend to do.
[06:23.420 --> 06:25.020]  And it was really inspiring.
[06:25.020 --> 06:30.660]  It was like trying to cut down that time and have these interactions that kind of help
[06:30.660 --> 06:32.140]  move the industry forward in such a way.
[06:32.140 --> 06:38.900]  And it'd be so cool to have an interesting study come out as a result of kind of our
[06:38.900 --> 06:42.860]  work to collaborate as a community here on the Dank Hour.
[06:42.860 --> 06:43.860]  That'd be pretty cool.
[06:43.860 --> 06:48.060]  Yeah, so there is, you know, if we do get a publication or even, you know, this this
[06:48.060 --> 06:53.140]  is a PhD student that is doing these experiments.
[06:53.140 --> 06:57.860]  She could put an acknowledgement in her dissertation that is it part of the requirement of you've
[06:57.860 --> 07:01.140]  got to write all that shit up before you can graduate, before they give you that little
[07:01.140 --> 07:02.140]  piece of paper.
[07:02.140 --> 07:07.180]  And also, if there is a publication, there is a section to put acknowledgments where
[07:07.180 --> 07:13.420]  we can absolutely give a shout out to the Dank Hour and, you know, for connections and
[07:13.420 --> 07:14.420]  all that.
[07:14.420 --> 07:15.420]  That'd be so cool.
[07:15.420 --> 07:16.420]  I'm nerding out right now.
[07:16.420 --> 07:17.420]  See, Tess is down.
[07:17.420 --> 07:27.540]  I'm just I'm just going to go in order because it's going to make my life easier to go in
[07:27.540 --> 07:28.540]  order.
[07:28.820 --> 07:31.500]  Dr. Tess, how are you doing?
[07:31.500 --> 07:32.500]  I'm great.
[07:32.500 --> 07:39.580]  It's hard to top all of the awesomeness that Anna just spoke about and all the connections.
[07:39.580 --> 07:43.420]  But yeah, a lot of those microbe episodes were some of my favorites.
[07:43.420 --> 07:45.260]  So this is Tess Edom.
[07:45.260 --> 07:47.180]  I am microbiologist.
[07:47.180 --> 07:51.180]  I have my own consulting company called Rogue Micro.
[07:51.180 --> 07:57.620]  So I help folks build like cannabis safety plans to make sure that their consumers are
[07:57.700 --> 08:02.660]  protected, especially from microbes and also overcome micro challenges.
[08:02.660 --> 08:08.260]  And so it's fun to talk about the good microbes, too, because they're also super important.
[08:08.260 --> 08:11.740]  So I've loved those episodes where we focus on that.
[08:11.740 --> 08:13.380]  And Anna, that's so cool.
[08:13.380 --> 08:15.740]  You're going to collaborate with Dr. White.
[08:15.740 --> 08:21.620]  I'm really excited to learn more about that and just really happy to be here and be part
[08:21.620 --> 08:22.620]  of the gang.
[08:22.620 --> 08:25.460]  And I think Johnny's next.
[08:25.460 --> 08:26.780]  No, no, we're not.
[08:26.940 --> 08:27.940]  We're not going that fast.
[08:27.940 --> 08:32.100]  We've got to get you a little bit further here because you're not getting off that easy
[08:32.100 --> 08:33.100]  quite yet.
[08:33.100 --> 08:37.820]  So I know you kind of acknowledge what your favorite episodes were, but what were it like?
[08:37.820 --> 08:40.300]  And you kind of glazed over this a little bit quickly.
[08:40.300 --> 08:44.020]  So what were what were kind of some highlights over the last year?
[08:44.020 --> 08:51.660]  I know you are actually one of our newer people on the day as a regular panelist.
[08:51.660 --> 08:55.540]  So you've had some fun year, an interesting year.
[08:55.580 --> 08:56.580]  What was the highlight?
[08:56.580 --> 09:03.140]  Like, was there a specific conversation that was that was specifically inspiring?
[09:03.140 --> 09:07.460]  I know I'm putting you on the spot here, but we tend to do that anyways.
[09:07.460 --> 09:10.540]  Was it was there one in particular as our microbiologist?
[09:10.540 --> 09:13.860]  We did we did end off the year in that heavy, heavy zone.
[09:13.860 --> 09:16.340]  But I think we had a lot of conversation.
[09:16.340 --> 09:20.460]  What were kind of what was one of your favorites?
[09:20.460 --> 09:21.460]  Like your absolute favorite?
[09:21.460 --> 09:22.460]  Yeah, that's good.
[09:22.500 --> 09:29.260]  I really think that a lot of it was sort of woven throughout each talk, like and to get
[09:29.260 --> 09:35.980]  everybody's perspective, you know, scientists are kind of stereotypically isolated from
[09:35.980 --> 09:43.540]  many different groups in society and the world and, you know, the whole ivory castle thing.
[09:43.540 --> 09:50.380]  And so it's been really cool to have these conversations with, like, you know, the actual
[09:50.420 --> 09:56.100]  farmers, like you were saying, and with people who are out there doing marketing and and
[09:56.100 --> 10:01.420]  starting small businesses and really like boots on the ground folks and kind of that
[10:01.420 --> 10:07.740]  intersection between like, you know, the science and the real world application.
[10:07.740 --> 10:13.820]  And and and even like just talking about I remember we had a conversation about with
[10:13.820 --> 10:20.820]  Boveda, you know, the the moisture control packets for curing and storing.
[10:20.820 --> 10:25.860]  And I remember that just being like such a cool even though it was like it's kind of a
[10:25.860 --> 10:32.980]  simple topic, like it was a really cool conversation because like everybody was talking,
[10:32.980 --> 10:36.300]  but then everyone was also like sending messages over Clubhouse.
[10:36.300 --> 10:38.620]  And like we all kind of had our own opinion.
[10:38.620 --> 10:43.260]  And it was really cool to see a lot of different people with a lot of different backgrounds
[10:43.260 --> 10:45.700]  like weigh in on something just that simple.
[10:45.700 --> 10:49.820]  And so that's what I really like about because it's also not simple.
[10:49.820 --> 10:57.780]  It's like actually really hard to control and like make good decisions while you're doing
[10:57.780 --> 11:02.940]  it and then also like try to collect data and try to analyze it and try to be sort of data
[11:02.940 --> 11:04.820]  driven in your decision making.
[11:04.820 --> 11:12.020]  So I think it's it's really awesome to be able to have that intersection between the
[11:12.020 --> 11:14.860]  different groups of people and all the different knowledge that we bring.
[11:14.860 --> 11:17.620]  And it kind of comes through a little bit in every episode.
[11:17.620 --> 11:20.660]  And that was just another little example of that.
[11:20.660 --> 11:21.740]  So, yeah.
[11:24.340 --> 11:25.580]  That will suffice.
[11:27.340 --> 11:28.380]  You shall pass.
[11:28.380 --> 11:29.380]  That will do.
[11:29.380 --> 11:30.740]  Next.
[11:30.740 --> 11:32.620]  You shall pass.
[11:33.940 --> 11:36.380]  What is your favorite color?
[11:36.380 --> 11:39.660]  If you guys don't know, Tess is a super nerd.
[11:39.660 --> 11:43.980]  She's like, I'm pretty sure you could find cosplay on her Instagram.
[11:43.980 --> 11:44.980]  And you look.
[11:47.180 --> 11:48.180]  Nothing wrong with that.
[11:48.180 --> 11:49.420]  I owe all the power to you.
[11:49.420 --> 11:52.620]  I'm totally in the same boat.
[11:52.620 --> 11:54.660]  But Johnny, you're up next, brother.
[11:54.660 --> 11:57.220]  How you just got through a huge move.
[11:57.220 --> 11:59.620]  There's been a lot going on in the last little while.
[11:59.620 --> 12:01.900]  There's been ups. There's been downs.
[12:01.900 --> 12:04.540]  There's been funds and there's been not so funds.
[12:04.540 --> 12:05.900]  What about you? What's going on with you?
[12:05.900 --> 12:07.860]  How have you been?
[12:07.860 --> 12:11.180]  Tell me a little bit about the travel lacrosse.
[12:11.180 --> 12:15.500]  And what was your kind of highlight episodes throughout the year?
[12:17.220 --> 12:18.220]  Hey, everybody.
[12:19.340 --> 12:22.060]  Sorry in advance if I have issues with my service.
[12:22.060 --> 12:25.700]  I somehow moved to a much more populated area,
[12:25.700 --> 12:29.140]  but it's like I'm in a black hole of cell phone reception.
[12:29.140 --> 12:34.060]  So but yeah, I just moved back, moved across the country,
[12:34.060 --> 12:36.700]  back to where I grew up in upstate New York.
[12:36.700 --> 12:41.260]  And I signed on as the director of cultivation for a facility.
[12:41.260 --> 12:43.980]  It's going to be focused on sustainable, regenerative
[12:45.420 --> 12:46.700]  cannabis cultivation.
[12:46.700 --> 12:48.900]  So I'm really excited about that.
[12:48.900 --> 12:51.500]  And yeah, the move was, you know, it was crazy.
[12:51.500 --> 12:55.900]  Hit some crazy weather and and took it nice and slow and easy.
[12:55.900 --> 12:58.780]  But I was putting in long days and
[12:58.780 --> 13:02.180]  it felt really great to to get back to,
[13:02.180 --> 13:05.620]  you know, touchdown and have some nice herb sitting here
[13:05.620 --> 13:09.020]  and roll to be able to roll up right when I touched down.
[13:09.300 --> 13:13.700]  It was it's quite a treat after after five days of just nothing.
[13:15.220 --> 13:18.140]  But yeah, so my my favorite episodes,
[13:18.700 --> 13:21.020]  you know, there's there's so many good ones.
[13:21.020 --> 13:23.260]  And I was just kind of going back through and looking at,
[13:23.540 --> 13:27.060]  you know, some of the episodes that we had.
[13:28.180 --> 13:30.140]  And, you know, I'm not going to lie.
[13:30.140 --> 13:30.700]  The Dr.
[13:30.700 --> 13:35.100]  James White episode with the rise of Fiji cycle was was absolutely incredible.
[13:35.380 --> 13:40.180]  And I listened to it on the trip back and it was it was so good.
[13:40.180 --> 13:45.340]  There's so many questions that arose from that and learning all that information.
[13:45.660 --> 13:49.580]  And it really inspired a lot of a lot of further questions.
[13:50.820 --> 13:51.980]  And I always love that.
[13:51.980 --> 13:55.100]  You know, it just makes you want to go deeper down the rabbit hole.
[13:55.900 --> 13:59.380]  But another episode that I really liked,
[14:00.780 --> 14:05.060]  you know, it was the cannabis business insider with Big League Genetics.
[14:05.060 --> 14:07.300]  And I believe it was Dave Algar.
[14:07.500 --> 14:09.100]  I don't know if I'm pronouncing his name right.
[14:09.100 --> 14:10.780]  But that dude was just cool.
[14:10.780 --> 14:12.820]  And and like a funny dude.
[14:12.820 --> 14:16.100]  I just remember having a really good feeling after after
[14:17.100 --> 14:19.420]  listening to that episode.
[14:19.420 --> 14:20.540]  But yeah, I mean, the Dr.
[14:20.540 --> 14:23.300]  James White episode was freaking phenomenal.
[14:23.300 --> 14:26.380]  I you know, I feel like I could listen to that 20 times
[14:26.380 --> 14:30.460]  and learn something new each time and have new questions.
[14:31.260 --> 14:33.180]  But yeah, so it's a pleasure.
[14:33.180 --> 14:36.340]  I'm sitting here, you know, not too far from where I grew up,
[14:36.340 --> 14:40.100]  smoking a nice hashed glyph and enjoying this last show with all of you.
[14:40.460 --> 14:41.740]  You people for the year.
[14:41.740 --> 14:43.140]  And it's been a great year.
[14:43.140 --> 14:46.260]  So thank you very much, London, for hosting this amazing
[14:47.660 --> 14:48.660]  amazing show.
[14:48.660 --> 14:53.020]  And and yeah, really appreciate you and everybody else in this room.
[14:53.980 --> 14:57.060]  It gets a little hectic, but it's been a lot of fun.
[14:57.060 --> 14:59.620]  And I got a lot of new new things coming next year.
[14:59.860 --> 15:03.220]  We got a meeting coming up and I'm going to present a lot of new bits
[15:03.220 --> 15:05.100]  and bobs and fun stuff, but it's been crazy.
[15:05.100 --> 15:08.100]  It's been like two years now.
[15:08.100 --> 15:12.500]  And and we've had some of the most incredible conversations,
[15:13.460 --> 15:16.820]  some of the most important conversations and some of the like
[15:16.820 --> 15:18.340]  just chill, most chill conversation.
[15:18.340 --> 15:20.980]  I find it's interesting because it's been mentioned a few times
[15:20.980 --> 15:22.340]  that everybody really, really liked Dr.
[15:22.340 --> 15:23.220]  James White.
[15:23.220 --> 15:28.020]  But we did have Jeff Lowensfeld, who talked about a relatively the same subject.
[15:28.620 --> 15:31.780]  But I can hear the people who are wanting, you know, more doctors.
[15:31.780 --> 15:32.700]  OK, cool.
[15:32.700 --> 15:37.220]  So I would love to know what people who had listened to throughout the year,
[15:37.540 --> 15:40.140]  what your opinion was of your favorite episode,
[15:40.140 --> 15:41.500]  because there was a lot of them as well.
[15:41.500 --> 15:42.940]  So let me know in the chat.
[15:42.940 --> 15:44.980]  I want to know what you guys want to see more of.
[15:44.980 --> 15:46.700]  So this is kind of helpful.
[15:46.700 --> 15:49.100]  We're going to get into that a little bit.
[15:49.100 --> 15:51.020]  Oh, Ponyx, how's it going, brother?
[15:51.020 --> 15:52.700]  It's great to catch up with you.
[15:52.700 --> 15:57.900]  Last time we talked, it was in November and you were in Thailand.
[15:57.900 --> 15:59.340]  You were doing a few things there.
[15:59.340 --> 16:01.140]  But on top of that, you were working.
[16:01.140 --> 16:05.300]  You're promoting the online regenerative
[16:05.300 --> 16:07.740]  or aquaponics conference, correct?
[16:09.220 --> 16:09.980]  Yeah, yeah.
[16:09.980 --> 16:12.740]  And actually, we ended up moving the date back to January.
[16:12.740 --> 16:15.180]  So actually, the virtual aquaponics
[16:15.180 --> 16:18.300]  cannabis conference is coming up January 14th and 15th
[16:19.060 --> 16:19.940]  on the YouTube channel.
[16:19.940 --> 16:21.060]  So you guys can check that out.
[16:21.060 --> 16:24.100]  You can check out the previous years for free on YouTube.
[16:24.100 --> 16:25.900]  The conference is always free.
[16:26.860 --> 16:29.500]  Try to get more education out there on aquaponics.
[16:29.500 --> 16:31.500]  But yeah, I'm still living in Thailand.
[16:31.500 --> 16:36.700]  I'm kind of going to be living in Thailand, at least for now.
[16:36.700 --> 16:39.900]  I don't know when I'll decide to change that.
[16:39.900 --> 16:42.220]  But for now, it's really nice here.
[16:42.220 --> 16:44.380]  And the plant counts are really nice.
[16:44.380 --> 16:46.460]  And the lack of regulation is really nice.
[16:46.460 --> 16:50.220]  And you can actually do business without having to jump
[16:50.220 --> 16:53.260]  through the 10,000 hoops that the United States makes you do.
[16:53.260 --> 16:55.900]  So it's kind of hard to find a reason to leave.
[16:57.940 --> 17:00.380]  No, no, that would be pretty challenging.
[17:00.380 --> 17:03.260]  I would have trouble getting out of that, for sure.
[17:04.980 --> 17:08.420]  I'd love to talk to Dr. Anne.
[17:10.660 --> 17:12.420]  So I guess it's Dr. Schwab.
[17:12.420 --> 17:13.820]  I apologize.
[17:13.820 --> 17:15.420]  I'd love to talk to her offline, too.
[17:15.420 --> 17:17.620]  It's nice to see some more aquaponics people
[17:17.620 --> 17:18.660]  doing the research side.
[17:18.660 --> 17:21.060]  I've been doing that for a long time.
[17:21.100 --> 17:23.060]  I think at this point, longer than anybody else
[17:23.060 --> 17:24.020]  that's in the industry.
[17:24.020 --> 17:25.060]  So that's pretty fun.
[17:25.060 --> 17:27.300]  But yeah, we're actually setting up a large living soil
[17:27.300 --> 17:31.340]  and aquaponics facility out here in Thailand.
[17:31.340 --> 17:33.460]  We're going to be one of the largest in terms of square
[17:33.460 --> 17:34.740]  footage.
[17:34.740 --> 17:38.260]  Certainly in this province, I think we're the top three.
[17:38.260 --> 17:39.580]  That's for sure.
[17:39.580 --> 17:41.980]  But yeah, so just having a good time.
[17:41.980 --> 17:45.140]  As far as episodes that I really enjoyed on your stuff,
[17:45.140 --> 17:47.820]  you had one a while back on natural farming inputs.
[17:47.820 --> 17:50.060]  And there was a lot of different people.
[17:51.020 --> 17:54.500]  You're getting a little bit of a quiet mic.
[17:54.500 --> 17:57.700]  If you could speak into it a little bit louder or a little
[17:57.700 --> 17:58.420]  bit heavier.
[17:58.420 --> 18:01.580]  I guess it's not using the headset mic.
[18:01.580 --> 18:02.300]  Is that better?
[18:02.300 --> 18:04.100]  Yeah, it's a little bit better.
[18:04.100 --> 18:06.500]  One of the problems is that we're
[18:06.500 --> 18:08.820]  going through Clubhouse onto the YouTube.
[18:08.820 --> 18:10.860]  So it's not as great.
[18:10.860 --> 18:13.460]  So you got to be a little bit loud on some microphone setup.
[18:13.460 --> 18:16.180]  So don't be afraid to be a little bit loud for me, OK?
[18:16.180 --> 18:19.060]  I mean, you might look a little weird wherever you are.
[18:19.060 --> 18:21.540]  We appreciate it.
[18:21.540 --> 18:24.500]  So I do want to, after that, I do
[18:24.500 --> 18:26.340]  want to angle a question towards you as well.
[18:26.340 --> 18:27.660]  Because you do your own content.
[18:27.660 --> 18:30.140]  And I'd like to know who one of your favorite guests
[18:30.140 --> 18:31.180]  were throughout the year.
[18:31.180 --> 18:33.100]  But continue what you were going to say there.
[18:33.100 --> 18:35.900]  And then maybe follow up with that question.
[18:35.900 --> 18:36.580]  Sure.
[18:36.580 --> 18:38.620]  You had a really good episode a while back
[18:38.620 --> 18:40.780]  with a bunch of different KNF people
[18:40.780 --> 18:44.740]  that kind of had a bunch of different takes on it.
[18:44.740 --> 18:46.140]  And that was really interesting.
[18:46.140 --> 18:48.420]  I always enjoy kind of the differences
[18:48.460 --> 18:50.260]  with the natural farming stuff.
[18:50.260 --> 18:52.020]  I think that there's so much more there
[18:52.020 --> 18:55.220]  that we can learn and hybridize from each other's knowledge.
[18:55.220 --> 18:58.660]  It really was my favorite one of your show.
[18:58.660 --> 19:03.460]  And then as far as the guests that I had on this year,
[19:03.460 --> 19:05.940]  I think the one that I was the most stoked about, at least,
[19:05.940 --> 19:11.860]  was Hunting Down Mr. Green from the old early 2000 videos.
[19:11.860 --> 19:13.580]  Finally finding him for an interview
[19:13.580 --> 19:15.060]  was kind of special.
[19:15.060 --> 19:17.300]  Because he started not only my cannabis career,
[19:17.300 --> 19:19.140]  but I think a lot of other people's.
[19:19.140 --> 19:20.540]  So that was really, really great.
[19:20.540 --> 19:22.980]  But on the science side, I really
[19:22.980 --> 19:28.380]  enjoyed talking with Arasnig from India.
[19:28.380 --> 19:33.060]  He does all the land race work with the guys in Afghanistan.
[19:33.060 --> 19:35.420]  I learned about some of the more traditional hash making
[19:35.420 --> 19:37.420]  methods from India, as well as some
[19:37.420 --> 19:39.420]  of the different phenotypic traits
[19:39.420 --> 19:41.900]  of a lot of the land race stuff from that part of the world
[19:41.900 --> 19:50.520]  was really, really interesting.
[19:50.880 --> 19:55.720]  And the other person was Nigel Palmer,
[19:55.720 --> 19:57.240]  who had a lot of interesting takes
[19:57.240 --> 20:00.280]  on how to further increase bioavailability of nutrients
[20:00.280 --> 20:02.840]  in natural farming solutions using vinegars.
[20:02.840 --> 20:05.200]  So basically, taking a lot of the different inputs
[20:05.200 --> 20:10.520]  and then before using them for steeping,
[20:10.520 --> 20:13.680]  basically doing a vinegar breakdown on them first.
[20:13.680 --> 20:15.240]  It was a pretty interesting concept
[20:15.240 --> 20:17.320]  and definitely does make an increase
[20:17.320 --> 20:25.730]  in total bioavailability PPMs from natural farming inputs.
[20:25.730 --> 20:26.450]  That's awesome.
[20:26.450 --> 20:28.210]  I really love what you guys put out there.
[20:28.210 --> 20:30.610]  And you guys put out a lot of free information
[20:30.610 --> 20:33.370]  to support communities and support everybody around you,
[20:33.370 --> 20:35.250]  which is awesome.
[20:35.250 --> 20:36.570]  And I appreciate you.
[20:36.570 --> 20:38.770]  And we'll come back to you in a little bit.
[20:38.770 --> 20:41.810]  Claude, Robert, I know we're going to say the same thing.
[20:41.810 --> 20:43.970]  Make sure to yell into that mic a little bit for me,
[20:43.970 --> 20:45.850]  because you come through a little bit quietly.
[20:45.850 --> 20:47.490]  We want to make sure everybody can hear you on the last episode.
[20:47.490 --> 20:48.190]  It's been great.
[20:48.190 --> 20:50.330]  You did multiple episodes throughout the year.
[20:50.370 --> 20:54.970]  You were our IPM guest, repeat guest,
[20:54.970 --> 20:56.850]  where we talked about all sorts of methodologies
[20:56.850 --> 20:58.810]  and all sorts of bugs that you guys can release
[20:58.810 --> 21:01.090]  and all sorts of things that you can do throughout the year
[21:01.090 --> 21:04.690]  to be able to do exactly that,
[21:05.770 --> 21:07.890]  have an IPM and the pest protocol.
[21:07.890 --> 21:10.290]  So thanks, Claude, for coming back and saying hello
[21:11.250 --> 21:14.370]  on our season finale as one of our regular guests.
[21:14.370 --> 21:16.610]  How are you doing? What happened throughout the year?
[21:16.610 --> 21:19.210]  And I know you tuned into a few episodes as well.
[21:19.250 --> 21:22.570]  Was there any particular episodes that you were a major fan of
[21:22.570 --> 21:24.890]  or that you remember that you particularly enjoyed?
[21:28.030 --> 21:30.630]  Hi, everyone. Is everyone hearing me good?
[21:31.990 --> 21:33.510]  Loud and clear.
[21:33.510 --> 21:36.390]  Perfect. So it was an amazing year.
[21:37.390 --> 21:40.790]  Really honored to be part of the Dank Hour team,
[21:40.790 --> 21:42.790]  Future Academics Project Channel.
[21:42.790 --> 21:46.950]  You kind of grow a bunch of people, all passionate people.
[21:47.350 --> 21:51.550]  It's hard to find an episode that I liked better than the others.
[21:51.550 --> 21:53.750]  I really liked, like the other people said,
[21:53.750 --> 21:55.950]  the risot-faggy with Dr. James White.
[21:56.950 --> 22:01.550]  I like to, when people go deep down into a subject,
[22:01.550 --> 22:07.550]  and I really enjoyed also being able to meet Matthew Gates,
[22:07.550 --> 22:10.750]  another bug nerd like me.
[22:10.750 --> 22:13.830]  So I'm living the life.
[22:13.830 --> 22:16.830]  I'm living the life. I cannot believe my job.
[22:16.830 --> 22:20.830]  It's not a job. I'm helping people grow better crops.
[22:21.430 --> 22:24.830]  We're learning how to deal with all pests of cannabis
[22:24.830 --> 22:28.830]  and trying to deal with the very special plant it is,
[22:28.830 --> 22:32.430]  trying to protect it because it's not like the other plants.
[22:33.430 --> 22:36.830]  I really enjoyed the shows about genetics this year.
[22:37.430 --> 22:40.830]  Also, that's one of my passions too.
[22:41.630 --> 22:46.830]  So I'm looking forward to many, many things coming in the new year.
[22:47.830 --> 22:50.830]  I think maybe we'll talk about that later on.
[22:50.830 --> 22:55.830]  I'll be at Lift Expo in Vancouver from the 12th to the 14th.
[22:55.830 --> 22:58.030]  So I'm really excited about that.
[22:58.030 --> 23:01.830]  And I don't want to miss the Unicron Cup this year.
[23:02.830 --> 23:06.830]  So in 2023, I'm planning ahead.
[23:06.830 --> 23:08.830]  I hope it happens.
[23:08.830 --> 23:11.830]  So there's a lot of people I want to talk to, I'm sure.
[23:11.830 --> 23:16.830]  So I'll let you guys go and continue on.
[23:18.830 --> 23:21.830]  Awesome. Thanks, Claude. It was awesome.
[23:21.830 --> 23:24.830]  You really provided and came in and added a ton of value.
[23:24.830 --> 23:28.830]  You were very open to like one of the things that can be challenging in this space
[23:28.830 --> 23:33.830]  is having a lot of intelligent, strong, independent human beings together
[23:33.830 --> 23:38.830]  in a room or a space and continue to have the conversation,
[23:38.830 --> 23:41.830]  especially when you have two experts in the same field.
[23:41.830 --> 23:43.830]  Sometimes that can make things more challenging
[23:43.830 --> 23:45.830]  or it can make things really, really, really awesome.
[23:45.830 --> 23:49.830]  And you're totally open to bringing on Matthew Gates
[23:49.830 --> 23:51.830]  when he jumped on and coming on to the show.
[23:51.830 --> 23:53.830]  And it was a lot of fun. You guys interacted great.
[23:53.830 --> 23:56.830]  It was really a great conversation to be had
[23:56.830 --> 23:58.830]  to check out a whole bunch of those episodes,
[23:58.830 --> 24:00.830]  including the one with Matthew Gates.
[24:00.830 --> 24:01.830]  So thanks a lot for being there.
[24:01.830 --> 24:03.830]  And I got a few more questions, but again, we'll get back to you.
[24:03.830 --> 24:06.830]  Shannon Ross, thanks for coming in tonight.
[24:06.830 --> 24:08.830]  It was great having you on.
[24:08.830 --> 24:10.830]  You were an awesome guest.
[24:10.830 --> 24:14.830]  There was a ton of great comments on your show.
[24:14.830 --> 24:18.830]  Everybody really enjoyed having you on and what you brought to the table.
[24:18.830 --> 24:22.830]  What has been some highlights, some epic parts of the last year,
[24:22.830 --> 24:25.830]  some fun things that happened?
[24:25.830 --> 24:29.830]  I know you tuned into all of our newer episodes.
[24:30.830 --> 24:34.830]  I don't see things happening, but I see there has been some pretty big events
[24:34.830 --> 24:38.830]  that have happened throughout your time in the last year.
[24:38.830 --> 24:40.830]  So I'd love to hear a little bit about those
[24:40.830 --> 24:43.830]  and maybe a little bit about what you're looking forward to in the new year.
[24:43.830 --> 25:01.860]  Are you there, Shannon?
[25:01.860 --> 25:11.400]  Nope.
[25:11.400 --> 25:15.400]  I would try coming in and out of the room
[25:15.400 --> 25:17.400]  or closing down the app and coming back in.
[25:17.400 --> 25:18.400]  It might be a little bit better.
[25:18.400 --> 25:19.400]  We'll go down.
[25:19.400 --> 25:22.400]  Dennis, how is it going?
[25:22.400 --> 25:24.400]  I hope you've enjoyed the year.
[25:24.400 --> 25:25.400]  You've been on a couple episodes.
[25:25.400 --> 25:28.400]  You've seen a couple episodes that have happened.
[25:28.400 --> 25:29.400]  Yes.
[25:29.400 --> 25:33.400]  There's been a few fun things that have gone out throughout the period of time.
[25:33.400 --> 25:34.400]  So what about you?
[25:34.400 --> 25:38.400]  What has been the fun few things that happened throughout the year last year
[25:38.400 --> 25:41.400]  that really made landmark occasions for yourself?
[25:41.400 --> 25:43.400]  What was some joyous stuff?
[25:43.400 --> 25:44.400]  Because you did a little bit of traveling.
[25:44.400 --> 25:47.400]  You've done some fun stuff over the last year.
[25:48.400 --> 25:51.400]  Yes, I did a little bit of fun traveling and such.
[25:51.400 --> 25:54.400]  It's been a year, I'm sure.
[25:54.400 --> 25:58.400]  For everybody, it's been quite the year.
[25:58.400 --> 26:01.400]  I didn't end up where I expected to be at the end of this year,
[26:01.400 --> 26:07.400]  but also I'm not unhappy with where I'm at.
[26:07.400 --> 26:13.400]  In terms of shows, and just to thank what I do,
[26:13.400 --> 26:15.400]  I can't really isolate any one particular show
[26:15.400 --> 26:21.400]  because I appreciate what you do in terms of you're really good at bringing
[26:21.400 --> 26:26.400]  together multidisciplines together, bringing expertise at multiple levels.
[26:26.400 --> 26:33.400]  And the questions that you ask, a lot of times you can hear the passion
[26:33.400 --> 26:34.400]  in the speakers.
[26:34.400 --> 26:41.400]  And sometimes you get on these shows and people are getting to their modes
[26:42.400 --> 26:46.400]  and they're talking about talking points they've spoken about multiple times before.
[26:46.400 --> 26:51.400]  And while interesting, sometimes there's a lack of passion.
[26:51.400 --> 26:57.400]  But that's something that I have noticed that you're pretty good at getting out
[26:57.400 --> 27:00.400]  of a lot of these speakers, which I appreciate as a listener.
[27:03.400 --> 27:04.400]  Favourite shows?
[27:04.400 --> 27:07.400]  I mean, I'm a little biased.
[27:07.400 --> 27:11.400]  I would actually kind of say I did also enjoy Shannon's show.
[27:11.400 --> 27:13.400]  I was able to listen to it after the fact.
[27:13.400 --> 27:18.400]  And just in general, anytime there's people that come on that are trying
[27:18.400 --> 27:24.400]  to truly support others in the industry, not only themselves,
[27:24.400 --> 27:27.400]  it's hard to make it through just by yourself in the first place,
[27:27.400 --> 27:32.400]  but to take the added weight of trying to bring light and highlight other people.
[27:32.400 --> 27:36.400]  I do appreciate speakers such as that.
[27:36.400 --> 27:42.400]  And so that was one of the others that I was keenly interested in.
[27:42.400 --> 27:49.400]  And I'm hopeful for next year in terms of, you know, this year was quite busy.
[27:49.400 --> 27:55.400]  Our retail that my partner, Mark, and I, we did not open as we kind of expected
[27:55.400 --> 27:58.400]  this year and it looks like we're pushed back a little bit longer.
[27:58.400 --> 28:01.400]  But, you know, we also did the Eagle Corp Cup this year,
[28:01.400 --> 28:11.400]  which was quite the effort and had very positive results that we were happy to hear.
[28:11.400 --> 28:19.400]  And more importantly, the feelings that came out of that event was one of reconnection
[28:19.400 --> 28:22.400]  and revitalization.
[28:22.400 --> 28:28.400]  And since that time and afterwards, I've seen a lot more of an uptick in terms
[28:28.400 --> 28:34.400]  of organizations really trying to connect people and get conversations started again.
[28:34.400 --> 28:48.120]  And so I'm very thankful to be among that group of people that are trying to make this effort.
[28:48.120 --> 28:50.120]  We do and there has been a bunch.
[28:50.120 --> 28:54.120]  So what I do want to do is we are at about half an hour point here.
[28:54.120 --> 28:56.120]  Shannon seems to be in the matrix.
[28:56.120 --> 29:02.120]  If you can hear me, speak up and we'll get to you.
[29:02.120 --> 29:04.120]  Try and unmute the mic and say hello.
[29:04.120 --> 29:12.120]  It looks like your mic's unmuted from here, which is the weird part, which is very, very interesting.
[29:12.120 --> 29:17.120]  So what I want to do and we were expecting to have a few of the guests come back
[29:17.120 --> 29:21.120]  and we have a few guests that have come back here, which has been awesome.
[29:21.120 --> 29:23.120]  And again, we are at our season finale next year.
[29:23.120 --> 29:25.120]  We're going to have a whole new round of stuff going.
[29:25.120 --> 29:26.120]  We're going to be on Clubhouse.
[29:26.120 --> 29:27.120]  I don't know.
[29:27.120 --> 29:28.120]  Maybe we'll just be on YouTube.
[29:28.120 --> 29:29.120]  I don't know.
[29:29.120 --> 29:30.120]  Maybe there'll be some new things.
[29:30.120 --> 29:35.120]  So make sure that this evening you're going into that description, you're following, you're liking,
[29:35.120 --> 29:40.120]  you're tagging up the community, making sure that you're available and following these people
[29:40.120 --> 29:43.120]  so that you can support them and the community and what they put forward
[29:43.120 --> 29:48.120]  because they've all provided a ton of their time to be able to support and bring everything moving forward.
[29:48.120 --> 29:52.120]  So I want to do this and I'm going to change things up a little bit
[29:52.120 --> 29:54.120]  and I'm going to try and invite some people and come up on stage.
[29:54.120 --> 29:59.120]  If you've been a fan of the show or watched it on any sort of a regular basis,
[29:59.120 --> 30:04.120]  I'd love for you to come up and say hello and let us know what you,
[30:04.120 --> 30:09.120]  if there was a particular show or episode that you really enjoyed over the last year.
[30:09.120 --> 30:12.120]  I would love it if you have the opportunity to come on up.
[30:12.120 --> 30:16.120]  I'm going to shoot some invites from down below or put your hand up.
[30:16.120 --> 30:20.120]  If there was a particular episode, if there's something that you want to see,
[30:20.120 --> 30:23.120]  let us know about that too because that's kind of fun.
[30:23.120 --> 30:25.120]  Some of the fun part as well.
[30:25.120 --> 30:32.060]  Shooting the invites down below.
[30:32.060 --> 30:39.060]  But while we're doing that, Dr. Anubis, what do you want to see in the new year?
[30:39.060 --> 30:41.060]  Who do you want to talk to? What do you want to talk about?
[30:41.060 --> 30:44.060]  What are some things that you want to dig into and learn about?
[30:44.060 --> 30:49.060]  We touched on epigenetics at some point this year and it's still far,
[30:50.060 --> 30:53.060]  I have no idea what's going on there.
[30:53.060 --> 31:01.060]  But what are some of the subjects that you would like to dig into as a geneticist?
[31:03.060 --> 31:08.060]  I do, as you know, love the topic of epigenetics.
[31:08.060 --> 31:16.060]  However, the conversation really can't go much past, we don't know.
[31:17.060 --> 31:24.060]  There's nobody really doing any research on epigenetics proper.
[31:26.060 --> 31:36.060]  You can't really, unless you're doing methylation or acetylation studies on the epigenome,
[31:36.060 --> 31:41.060]  you really can't tease apart what's phenotypic plasticity
[31:41.060 --> 31:52.060]  and what really is an epigenetic change that's getting passed on to the next generation through transmission.
[31:52.060 --> 32:02.060]  And because cannabis is, the way that we keep cannabis as consistent as we can, a lot of it is cloned.
[32:03.060 --> 32:13.060]  So as far as epigenetics goes, we can't even figure that out because it's not really a transmission thing at that point.
[32:13.060 --> 32:19.060]  It's just your mother plant having its genome.
[32:21.060 --> 32:25.060]  Every time I think about it, London, I see this to you all the time.
[32:26.060 --> 32:33.060]  My mind just starts going crazy because there's so many questions, so many things that we don't know,
[32:33.060 --> 32:36.060]  so many things that we would have to look at and just we don't know.
[32:36.060 --> 32:42.060]  Most epigenetic work has been done on animals, obviously.
[32:42.060 --> 32:46.060]  A lot of it has been done in terms of cancer research.
[32:46.060 --> 32:53.060]  In terms of plants, I think only 3% of epigenetic studies have been carried out on plants.
[32:53.060 --> 32:59.060]  And in terms of asexual plants, like plants that are cloned themselves, like dandelions,
[32:59.060 --> 33:06.060]  I think only a handful of those 3% of total studies are done on asexual plants.
[33:06.060 --> 33:13.060]  So basically what we know in terms of epigenetics and cannabis is literally nothing.
[33:14.060 --> 33:26.060]  So everything that I talk about, everything that I think is 100% not backed up by any kind of facts.
[33:29.060 --> 33:34.060]  Let's see. So I mean, that's always a fun conversation because there's a lot of what ifs.
[33:34.060 --> 33:42.060]  There's a lot of how abouts, which is great for scientists because that's what keeps us employed.
[33:42.060 --> 33:46.060]  It's like asking questions and then trying to figure out how to answer them.
[33:46.060 --> 33:49.060]  So that's why you put it at the end of every paper.
[33:49.060 --> 33:52.060]  Yeah, it needs more research.
[33:52.060 --> 33:54.060]  That's because you guys like getting paid.
[33:54.060 --> 34:02.060]  Yeah. Well, but we don't get paid a lot, which is contrary to popular belief.
[34:02.060 --> 34:10.060]  But yeah, like literally every cannabis paper that I read, it's like they list the limitations of the study,
[34:10.060 --> 34:18.060]  which is usually like small sample size or we only used one or two strains or half of our shit died during the experiment.
[34:18.060 --> 34:22.060]  So we're only left with this many to like actually whatever.
[34:22.060 --> 34:29.060]  So they list the limitations. And then the second thing they say is these results support blah, blah, blah.
[34:29.060 --> 34:32.060]  But more research is needed.
[34:33.060 --> 34:41.060]  So, you know, I am the most exciting things to me coming up in the can.
[34:41.060 --> 34:50.060]  Obviously, since I'm a geneticist, like, you know, trait tracking and, you know, some of the polyploid work that's going on is pretty exciting.
[34:50.060 --> 35:01.060]  I would like to see now that it's actually on the market, some of these polyploid types that are being sold, CB, Oregon CBD.
[35:02.060 --> 35:06.060]  And I think we're. Dark heart is the other one.
[35:06.060 --> 35:17.060]  So we've got a hemp company selling CBD type strains or varieties, and then we've got also the THC type flower coming out of dark heart.
[35:17.060 --> 35:22.060]  They both offer polyploids, a polyploid line.
[35:22.060 --> 35:28.060]  So those are triploids and they're not supposed to be able to be pollinated by regular diploid pollen.
[35:28.060 --> 35:32.060]  But, you know, this is the first year I think that both.
[35:32.060 --> 35:37.060]  No, last year was Oregon CBD came out with theirs and put it out on the market this year.
[35:37.060 --> 35:40.060]  I think dark heart and Oregon CBD have both.
[35:40.060 --> 35:48.060]  But I am going to be interested to see how all that shakes out because we really don't know that much about it.
[35:52.060 --> 35:55.060]  Yeah, I don't know. I'm just like interested to see how all that goes.
[35:55.060 --> 36:04.060]  And then, you know, just finding different genes and the genomes and mess.
[36:04.060 --> 36:07.060]  So anything that we figure out is kind of exciting at this point.
[36:07.060 --> 36:11.060]  Genome was published in 2012 and we still don't have it together.
[36:11.060 --> 36:17.060]  So. I like this.
[36:17.060 --> 36:19.060]  I like I think that's a good that's a good base.
[36:20.060 --> 36:24.060]  I like digging into the polyploidism and stuff like that with these new stuff.
[36:24.060 --> 36:28.060]  And there's a lot more information coming to market and a lot more stuff going on there.
[36:28.060 --> 36:34.060]  So maybe we should we should drag in one of those one of those suppliers and ask them about what the hell they're doing.
[36:34.060 --> 36:38.330]  That's kind of what we do in that.
[36:38.330 --> 36:40.330]  Yeah, that'd be great.
[36:40.330 --> 36:48.330]  That'd be great. Now we got gravy kilos, a regular listener to the show, a regular attendee pretty much every single week.
[36:48.330 --> 36:52.330]  We appreciate you being here and being a regular listener.
[36:52.330 --> 36:56.330]  How are you doing today? And what was one of your favorite episodes?
[36:56.330 --> 37:01.330]  I mean, you enjoyed it. And then what would you like to see in the next year?
[37:01.330 --> 37:04.330]  What are some things that you you would really like to have on?
[37:04.330 --> 37:06.330]  Who is it that you would like to see?
[37:06.330 --> 37:12.330]  Because we've got a great list of awesome people to bring on and talk about stuff.
[37:12.330 --> 37:26.520]  So what's up with you?
[37:26.520 --> 37:29.520]  You're unmuted, but I don't hear you.
[37:29.520 --> 37:44.090]  I don't hear you, gravy.
[37:44.090 --> 37:47.090]  Give it a minute. Come back in and out. Do what you can.
[37:47.090 --> 37:57.090]  For now, we're going to pop over real quick to Shannon Ross and say hello.
[37:57.090 --> 37:59.090]  Are you coming through now? Can you get through?
[37:59.090 --> 38:01.090]  I hope so.
[38:01.090 --> 38:03.090]  Yes.
[38:03.090 --> 38:14.110]  I tried to be all tech savvy.
[38:14.110 --> 38:19.110]  The farmer and the tech is always a challenging time.
[38:19.110 --> 38:24.110]  Don't be afraid to go right in. It'll be a little bit loud in the mic, too, just as a heads up.
[38:24.110 --> 38:28.110]  You're coming through pretty clear, but don't be afraid to get up and yell in there a little bit.
[38:28.110 --> 38:30.110]  So you've had an exciting year.
[38:30.110 --> 38:35.110]  There's been lots of fun developments and changes in what's been going on in your life.
[38:35.110 --> 38:37.110]  What has been going on?
[38:37.110 --> 38:40.110]  What are some highlights over the last year?
[38:40.110 --> 38:42.110]  You came on as one of our later episodes.
[38:42.110 --> 38:45.110]  There hasn't been that many changes. You were on a few weeks ago.
[38:45.110 --> 38:52.110]  So what were, of your year, some big highlights that you'd like to chat and mention while you're here?
[38:52.110 --> 39:01.110]  Well, first of all, I want to thank you for having me on and introducing me to this amazing community.
[39:01.110 --> 39:09.110]  I think that's part of the highlight, is just expanding the network and reaching out to other cannabis lovers
[39:09.110 --> 39:13.110]  and people that are dedicated to this plant.
[39:13.110 --> 39:19.110]  I have to say I'm a bit jealous of Potent over there, hanging out in Thailand and growing in the tropics.
[39:19.110 --> 39:26.110]  That's something I've always wanted to do, but I'm stuck here in Canada under lots of snow.
[39:26.110 --> 39:34.110]  But I'd say I had a lot of highlights. It's been a massively packed year.
[39:34.110 --> 39:41.110]  I did a cross-country trip where I drove across Canada and stopped in every province
[39:41.110 --> 39:49.110]  and met different craft cultivators across Canada and ended in Toronto at the Oak Cannabis,
[39:49.110 --> 39:56.110]  which I saw Claude there, which was really nice. Hi, Claude. Good to see you here.
[39:56.110 --> 40:06.110]  I spoke at Oak Cannabis about the importance of making a fair transition and bringing craft growers into the legal market,
[40:06.110 --> 40:15.110]  especially from a scientific place where here we are in a time of legalization.
[40:15.110 --> 40:25.110]  The great thing about legalization is research and development and starting to create opportunities to study this amazing plant.
[40:25.110 --> 40:33.110]  Part of that is we have a culture of cannabis cultivators that have been growing for decades,
[40:33.110 --> 40:38.110]  sometimes multi-generational, that have been collecting all these seeds.
[40:38.110 --> 40:50.110]  Within all these seeds are discoveries of what the effects are and how cannabis can create opportunities for people that are suffering.
[40:51.110 --> 40:58.110]  I spoke a lot about that and the importance of bringing these craft producers into the market
[40:58.110 --> 41:07.110]  so we can focus on all the genetics that lay in the hands of all the people from the culture.
[41:07.110 --> 41:14.110]  That was a great highlight. My first time in Toronto, I met a lot of great people.
[41:14.110 --> 41:26.110]  Then I flew to Lisbon and spoke at the Canna Portugal there and did a presentation where I highlighted all the craft growers here in the Kootenay region.
[41:27.110 --> 41:37.110]  It opened up my eyes to the big world and the culture.
[41:37.110 --> 41:45.110]  The Kootenay region in particular, the Emerald Triangle in the United States.
[41:45.110 --> 41:54.110]  People have been dedicated to this craft for so long and there's so much experience.
[41:55.110 --> 42:03.110]  When I look at the rest of the world as the world is about to get into legalizing cannabis,
[42:03.110 --> 42:09.110]  it just really opened my eyes to the amazing growers that we have.
[42:09.110 --> 42:11.110]  We have some of the best growers in the world.
[42:11.110 --> 42:21.110]  I'm pretty dedicated to bringing those growers into the light and helping create a fair transition.
[42:22.110 --> 42:30.110]  We just had an open house at Antidote, which is a grower-owned standard processing facility here in Nelson.
[42:30.110 --> 42:38.110]  Just this Saturday, we submitted our video evidence package, which was a year-long process of building this out.
[42:38.110 --> 42:45.110]  It's a huge, massive project. We're talking about jumping through the 10,000 hoops.
[42:46.110 --> 42:54.110]  Just really looking forward to getting our license and bringing the culture of cannabis to the world.
[42:57.110 --> 43:06.110]  Epic! I wish I could have been out there, but I probably would have gotten so stuck with this snow. It's incredible.
[43:06.110 --> 43:12.110]  I was thinking about you. There's a lot of snow on the ground right now.
[43:13.110 --> 43:16.110]  It's Vancouver Snowmageddon 2.0.
[43:16.110 --> 43:21.110]  I'm going to be at the Lift. Looking forward to seeing everyone at the Lift.
[43:21.110 --> 43:29.110]  In April, here in the Kootenays, Quantum, which is a craft producer, is going to be hosting another event.
[43:29.110 --> 43:35.110]  We've got Unicorn Cup. We're going to have lots more opportunities to all connect and build this community.
[43:36.110 --> 43:40.110]  It's going to be awesome. I'm coming for you next, Dr. Mark.
[43:40.110 --> 43:47.110]  How are you? Great to see you. You came on about a third to halfway through the year.
[43:47.110 --> 43:51.110]  You've been a guest before that.
[43:51.110 --> 43:56.110]  We were going through talking about our favorite episodes, what we really enjoyed chatting about,
[43:56.110 --> 44:01.110]  what were some of our funnest episodes, but also our highlights throughout the last year,
[44:01.110 --> 44:05.110]  and what have been the great awesomes that have happened.
[44:05.110 --> 44:11.110]  You've had a lot of great successes, both in your personal life and in your other life as well.
[44:11.110 --> 44:14.110]  It's been great. Good to see you, Dr. Mark.
[44:14.110 --> 44:21.110]  You're such a great moderator on this platform. You just crush it.
[44:21.110 --> 44:27.110]  I could sit and listen to you for so long.
[44:27.110 --> 44:31.110]  Just as I look at the panel, it was so nice to meet Claude.
[44:31.110 --> 44:41.110]  I think that was one of my favorite episodes where we did the full circle around the lacewing attractant properties of cat men
[44:41.110 --> 44:46.110]  and went deep down that rabbit hole. I think that was a fun one.
[44:46.110 --> 44:53.110]  I was liking what Dr. Anubis was saying.
[44:53.110 --> 45:00.110]  My focus for next year is we're going to start studying traumatic brain injury,
[45:00.110 --> 45:09.110]  collaborating with a traumatic brain injury specialist here at the University of Vermont who has some models.
[45:09.110 --> 45:20.110]  We're going to use different delivery methods to see what the most effective way of getting cannabinoids into the brain
[45:20.110 --> 45:25.110]  in that golden hour of trauma right after a concussion or some kind of a traumatic brain injury.
[45:25.110 --> 45:33.110]  We're really excited about that research. We're writing off your grants and raising money to do it.
[45:33.110 --> 45:38.110]  It's going to be a fun new year. Everyone be safe.
[45:38.110 --> 45:42.110]  What's everyone smoking out there tonight?
[45:42.110 --> 45:46.110]  I have some silver glued diamonds here.
[45:46.110 --> 45:52.110]  I have a GMO dosie that a friend of mine has produced a hash rosin out of.
[45:52.110 --> 45:58.110]  It's absolutely gorgeous. I got a beautiful piece of glass from Wildfire Glass.
[45:58.110 --> 46:01.110]  It's a true quartz banger.
[46:01.110 --> 46:07.110]  One of the fans of the show sent me a little three-piece marble set that's just epic.
[46:07.110 --> 46:11.110]  It has a little wiz-wazzle inside. It's so much fun.
[46:12.110 --> 46:16.110]  That's a neat little thing. That's what I'm smoking on.
[46:16.110 --> 46:18.110]  What are you smoking on, Dr. Mark?
[46:18.110 --> 46:21.110]  Do you have a highlight of the year?
[46:21.110 --> 46:30.110]  Silver glued diamonds. I'm in a state where it's adult use legal now.
[46:30.110 --> 46:34.110]  I think I can say that without getting in trouble.
[46:35.110 --> 46:46.110]  It's crazy because it's kind of like in Humboldt or in that area of California that we were just talking about.
[46:46.110 --> 47:01.110]  There's always been a long tradition of legacy, error, cannabis production in this area of New England.
[47:01.110 --> 47:05.110]  There's always been artisan producers.
[47:05.110 --> 47:20.110]  It's so cool because I think the Vermont rules are if you do have some kind of ding on your record, like a felony, even as high as a felony, they kind of look the other way.
[47:20.110 --> 47:23.110]  I had a friend who had all kinds of problems on his record.
[47:23.110 --> 47:29.110]  He was told in Michigan, no, you can't get a license with all those things.
[47:29.110 --> 47:36.110]  But in Vermont, they actually not only gave him a license, they waived all his fees.
[47:36.110 --> 47:54.110]  And so they're trying to really do the social equity thing right by getting people who previously got in trouble in the legacy markets involved because they recognize that those are the experts who really understand the plant and how to produce a quality product.
[47:54.110 --> 47:58.110]  And similar to maple syrup, we want tourists to come to Vermont.
[47:58.110 --> 48:01.110]  There's only less than a million people in Vermont.
[48:01.110 --> 48:14.110]  So we rely on all these tourists who come to Vermont from all those neighboring wealthy states like Massachusetts and New York to buy their maple syrup and their Vermont cheese and everything.
[48:15.110 --> 48:19.110]  Hopefully they'll buy their Vermont craft cannabis products as well.
[48:19.110 --> 48:29.110]  So just so exciting to just see a whole market just turn on, go from the shadows to the mall.
[48:29.110 --> 48:31.110]  So cool.
[48:31.110 --> 48:38.110]  If they can't make it all the way to Canada, I'm just saying we got some pretty good maple syrup here.
[48:38.110 --> 48:40.110]  The weed's coming along.
[48:40.110 --> 48:42.110]  The cannabis is coming along.
[48:43.110 --> 48:45.110]  It's no fair.
[48:45.110 --> 48:48.110]  You guys have more maple trees than we do.
[48:48.110 --> 48:51.110]  We're just a small, small little state.
[48:51.110 --> 48:57.110]  You know, you think about how big Canada is compared to Vermont.
[48:57.110 --> 48:59.110]  There's no comparison.
[48:59.110 --> 49:04.110]  So you don't know this, Dr. Mark, but there are results that come out of this.
[49:04.110 --> 49:11.110]  So we did the episode with Dr. James White and Dr. Anubis was like, yeah, we went down to Rutgers and now we're going to end up doing this cool study thing.
[49:12.110 --> 49:22.110]  So Peter, who has the Dagadot Garden, that is the official seed site for the Dan Keller panel and as well as all the future Cannabis Project content,
[49:22.110 --> 49:32.110]  he had to buy and bring in catnip seeds just because of our episode of our show.
[49:32.110 --> 49:34.110]  Just so you know.
[49:34.110 --> 49:37.110]  Oh, wait. So he grew catnip this year?
[49:38.110 --> 49:43.110]  Well, no, he brought in catnip seed to sell on our seed site with all of our beans and everything.
[49:43.110 --> 49:47.110]  So because after people listen to the episode, they're like, oh, you guys got to have that.
[49:47.110 --> 49:49.110]  Why don't you have any of those?
[49:49.110 --> 49:51.110]  Well, it's a beautiful plant.
[49:51.110 --> 49:53.110]  You know, it comes back year after year.
[49:53.110 --> 49:56.110]  It's voracious like most mints, you know.
[49:56.110 --> 50:03.110]  And I think even Claude said it makes a really good barrier, you know, separate your gardens.
[50:03.110 --> 50:06.110]  But yeah, it's beautiful.
[50:06.110 --> 50:07.110]  Cats love it.
[50:09.110 --> 50:11.110]  Love it. Love it. Love it.
[50:11.110 --> 50:14.110]  Jonathan Fernandez, how are you doing, brother?
[50:14.110 --> 50:16.110]  You were in the show earlier today.
[50:16.110 --> 50:26.110]  So this is my double, double, double feature today because we did the huge, huge show with the Cannabis for Breakfast where we toured and did all that.
[50:26.110 --> 50:28.110]  We had a bunch of people back for that one.
[50:28.110 --> 50:32.110]  And it was like, you know, Bubble Man, Racer Fanta, Brain Tap, Genetics.
[50:32.110 --> 50:35.110]  Just like all the coolest people.
[50:35.110 --> 50:37.110]  It was really a great conversation.
[50:37.110 --> 50:39.110]  So go back and check out that episode a little bit later.
[50:39.110 --> 50:40.110]  And you were there, too.
[50:40.110 --> 50:43.110]  It was also another great part of the conversation.
[50:43.110 --> 50:44.110]  But welcome back.
[50:44.110 --> 50:46.110]  You might have to unmute.
[50:46.110 --> 50:47.110]  You'll have to unmute your mic.
[50:47.110 --> 50:48.110]  How are you doing?
[50:48.110 --> 50:50.110]  You were in a couple episodes last year.
[50:50.110 --> 50:52.110]  Was there a highlight for you?
[50:52.110 --> 50:59.110]  And what were some highlights for you over the last year that were really some high points in your year for the cannabis space?
[51:00.110 --> 51:09.800]  If you're able to unmute your mic there, Jonathan.
[51:09.800 --> 51:17.960]  We're having, like, microphone difficulties on this app tonight.
[51:17.960 --> 51:18.960]  It's just brutal.
[51:18.960 --> 51:26.370]  You want to try coming back in and out?
[51:26.370 --> 51:30.370]  And then, Gravy, can you hear us now?
[51:30.370 --> 51:32.370]  Yes.
[51:32.370 --> 51:33.370]  Can you hear me?
[51:33.370 --> 51:34.370]  Yes.
[51:34.370 --> 51:35.370]  Welcome back.
[51:35.370 --> 51:37.370]  Yeah, thanks.
[51:37.370 --> 51:39.370]  I'm at work in Telluride, Colorado.
[51:39.370 --> 51:43.370]  And we've got a lot of tourists in town, so I had to help at the check stands.
[51:43.370 --> 51:47.370]  But I just wanted to get on and say thank you very much for having this space.
[51:47.370 --> 51:53.370]  And even though life is rough sometimes, I always look forward to the dank hour.
[51:53.370 --> 52:01.370]  And for the traumatic brain injury part, I've been using Cubenzas and Micro along with Dialed In.
[52:01.370 --> 52:02.370]  It's a gummy.
[52:02.370 --> 52:08.370]  And it's been a really good result, anecdotally, Dr. Nick.
[52:09.370 --> 52:12.370]  What was your injury, if I could ask?
[52:12.370 --> 52:18.370]  Oh, I had a car accident where I had to go to a speech therapist and learn how to speak again.
[52:18.370 --> 52:25.370]  And then I had to learn how to, you know, write down notes and stuff like that.
[52:25.370 --> 52:28.370]  And they asked me my social.
[52:28.370 --> 52:29.370]  I didn't know that.
[52:29.370 --> 52:30.370]  They asked me my birthday.
[52:30.370 --> 52:31.370]  I didn't know that.
[52:31.370 --> 52:32.370]  They asked me the year.
[52:32.370 --> 52:33.370]  I didn't know that.
[52:33.370 --> 52:34.370]  And then they said, who's the president?
[52:34.370 --> 52:35.370]  We'll give you a softball.
[52:35.370 --> 52:37.370]  And I said, that black guy.
[52:37.370 --> 52:39.370]  So that was when Obama was in office.
[52:39.370 --> 52:41.370]  So, I mean, it was a really bad injury.
[52:41.370 --> 52:43.370]  I had a motorcycle accident.
[52:43.370 --> 52:44.370]  I hit a deer.
[52:44.370 --> 52:46.370]  And I wasn't wearing a helmet.
[52:46.370 --> 52:51.370]  So it was a long road to recovery, but I'm almost there.
[52:51.370 --> 52:54.370]  So sometimes I misspeak or just sound like a dickhead.
[52:54.370 --> 52:56.370]  It's just because I don't know what word to use.
[52:56.370 --> 53:04.370]  But anyways, long story short, I just love you guys so much.
[53:04.370 --> 53:14.370]  Future candidates project is something I can forward to, whether it's a repeat or disability.
[53:14.370 --> 53:21.370]  And did you have a favorite episode over the last year or someone that you would like to see on the episode next year?
[53:21.370 --> 53:23.370]  I just think Dr.
[53:24.370 --> 53:27.370]  Anubis is great and the epigenetics is wonderful.
[53:27.370 --> 53:31.370]  And I look forward to the study in general.
[53:31.370 --> 53:36.370]  And I've been weaving around the plant, putting some heavy pressure on it.
[53:36.370 --> 53:41.370]  And it's fascinating to do companion planting.
[53:41.370 --> 53:44.370]  And I really appreciate Dr. Anubis so much.
[53:44.370 --> 53:46.370]  Every time she's on, she has some great stuff.
[53:46.370 --> 53:51.370]  And I like how she challenged the status quo for the nomenclature.
[53:51.370 --> 53:52.370]  That was a fun one.
[53:52.370 --> 53:55.370]  And there's been ones with Trevor on there.
[53:55.370 --> 53:59.370]  And Dr. Anubis go back and forth in a cool manner.
[53:59.370 --> 54:02.370]  So I just think the energy is great.
[54:02.370 --> 54:04.370]  I think the show is lovely.
[54:04.370 --> 54:11.370]  And I really appreciate your time, London, as a human being on this earth, putting those seeds out there in the puzzle boxes.
[54:11.370 --> 54:17.370]  And just interviewing my buddy Brainstrap from Area 420 on the morning show.
[54:18.370 --> 54:19.370]  I know that's not a big deal.
[54:19.370 --> 54:22.370]  But you're just a great human being all around.
[54:22.370 --> 54:24.370]  And sorry I'm talking so fast.
[54:24.370 --> 54:27.370]  I've got to go back in and manage the store.
[54:27.370 --> 54:31.370]  But I'm so glad you gave me the opportunity to just share the love.
[54:31.370 --> 54:35.370]  And life is a rough patch right now.
[54:35.370 --> 54:41.370]  I'm working probably 14-, 15-hour days.
[54:41.370 --> 54:46.370]  And I've got an hour and a half drive back home and an hour and a half drive to work.
[54:46.370 --> 54:49.370]  So any time I can listen to you guys, it's a blessing.
[54:49.370 --> 54:51.370]  So thank you so much.
[54:51.370 --> 55:04.370]  Well, if you're in Colorado and you know the guys over at Area 51, Area 420, and all them over there, I'll be in that area in June, July-ish.
[55:04.370 --> 55:06.370]  Like early July, late June.
[55:06.370 --> 55:09.370]  So hopefully we can connect and get together and smoke one.
[55:09.370 --> 55:15.370]  Yeah, that gives me a lot of opportunity to get some seeds together for you.
[55:15.370 --> 55:17.370]  And definitely.
[55:19.370 --> 55:20.370]  Awesome, brother.
[55:20.370 --> 55:22.370]  Well, thanks for coming up and saying hi.
[55:22.370 --> 55:23.370]  And get back to work.
[55:23.370 --> 55:25.370]  You've got a long day ahead of you, I bet.
[55:28.370 --> 55:31.370]  Jonathan, how are you doing, brother?
[55:31.370 --> 55:33.370]  Can you hear me now?
[55:33.370 --> 55:34.370]  I can hear you.
[55:34.370 --> 55:35.370]  Can you hear me?
[55:35.370 --> 55:36.370]  Yes, loud and clear.
[55:36.370 --> 55:38.370]  Actually, you've got great audio coming through right now.
[55:38.370 --> 55:39.370]  How are you doing?
[55:39.370 --> 55:42.370]  I know you tuned in to a few episodes.
[55:42.370 --> 55:50.370]  You were one of the sponsors for—you were the founding sponsor for Cannabis for Breakfast.
[55:50.370 --> 55:57.370]  What are some of the highlights that you saw throughout the year, last year, and for yourself?
[55:57.370 --> 56:01.370]  And if there was a particular show that you really enjoyed, I'd love to hear that, too.
[56:01.370 --> 56:04.370]  But thanks for coming on.
[56:04.370 --> 56:07.370]  And as usual, it's great to see you and share space with you.
[56:09.370 --> 56:10.370]  Yeah, no, awesome.
[56:10.370 --> 56:18.370]  I think the first thing I'd like to say is I just want to thank you, London, and the great work you've been doing with the show and even all your networking.
[56:18.370 --> 56:19.370]  It's fantastic.
[56:19.370 --> 56:28.370]  I've only known you about a year now, buddy, but it's amazing what you've been doing in this space, especially here in BC, having all the guests on that you had.
[56:28.370 --> 56:31.370]  We had a great morning session again.
[56:31.370 --> 56:35.370]  You've got a lot of good people here on the Clubhouse app, too.
[56:35.370 --> 56:36.370]  Just great information.
[56:36.370 --> 56:41.370]  I tune into some of the shows and I hear some stuff that I've never heard before.
[56:41.370 --> 56:46.370]  And I've networked with a few people that you put me in touch with that you've had on some of the shows.
[56:46.370 --> 56:47.370]  It's phenomenal.
[56:47.370 --> 56:54.370]  This year has been great in terms of just networking, meeting a lot of people in the community here in BC.
[56:54.370 --> 56:56.370]  And you've been a huge part of that.
[56:56.370 --> 56:58.370]  So I just want to thank you.
[56:58.370 --> 57:01.370]  And I'm sure other folks on this call want to also appreciate it, too.
[57:03.370 --> 57:04.370]  Thanks, brother.
[57:04.370 --> 57:06.370]  But it's about you, man.
[57:06.370 --> 57:07.370]  It's like I know.
[57:07.370 --> 57:08.370]  I don't know.
[57:08.370 --> 57:09.370]  Yeah.
[57:09.370 --> 57:12.370]  I've been talking this morning and I do a hell of a lot of talking.
[57:12.370 --> 57:19.370]  So I think the highlight show was that big feast you put on in the summer there.
[57:19.370 --> 57:23.370]  Nobody else got to eat that big feast.
[57:23.370 --> 57:26.370]  We were all doing that show.
[57:26.370 --> 57:28.370]  It was you, Dennis, and Mark.
[57:28.370 --> 57:30.370]  And we had your breeders on, correct?
[57:30.370 --> 57:31.370]  Yeah.
[57:31.370 --> 57:34.370]  We had George on our breeder and our master brewer there.
[57:34.370 --> 57:36.370]  And he had a phenomenal time.
[57:36.370 --> 57:37.370]  He doesn't get out much.
[57:37.370 --> 57:39.370]  He's out here in the Okanagan.
[57:39.370 --> 57:40.370]  He's up.
[57:40.370 --> 57:42.370]  He's stowed away in the mountains most of the time.
[57:42.370 --> 57:43.370]  So he never gets out.
[57:43.370 --> 57:45.370]  He doesn't even get down to the coast.
[57:45.370 --> 57:49.370]  And when he was there, he was like a pig in shed, right?
[57:49.370 --> 57:58.370]  Like so happy around cannabis people, just seeing everybody out in what's happening in the legal market now and just experiencing was great.
[57:58.370 --> 58:05.370]  And then the feast you put on, especially with some of that infused stuff, that was probably the highlight of the show for the year for sure.
[58:05.370 --> 58:06.370]  The feast was amazing.
[58:06.370 --> 58:07.370]  I have to jump in and say that.
[58:07.370 --> 58:10.370]  I got in so much shit with my wife for talking about it.
[58:10.370 --> 58:11.370]  I should not have opened my mouth.
[58:11.370 --> 58:12.370]  It was amazing.
[58:12.370 --> 58:18.370]  I'm just saying, Dennis, you're pretty close to me and the 23rd is coming up and I might be doing some cooking.
[58:18.370 --> 58:23.370]  If I can get my ass to the grocery store, there's a lot of fucking snow, man.
[58:23.370 --> 58:25.370]  No snow, I'm there.
[58:25.370 --> 58:27.370]  How much snow did you guys get down there?
[58:27.370 --> 58:28.370]  Oh my God, man.
[58:28.370 --> 58:30.370]  They're like a foot overnight last night.
[58:30.370 --> 58:31.370]  Yeah.
[58:31.370 --> 58:32.370]  Yeah.
[58:32.370 --> 58:34.370]  We're about a foot out here too in Kelowna.
[58:34.370 --> 58:37.370]  So yeah, we got a nice dump today.
[58:37.370 --> 58:43.370]  And so it's nothing new for me, but I guess new for people out here in BC, right?
[58:43.370 --> 58:44.370]  Yeah.
[58:44.370 --> 58:48.370]  Well, I mean, it's snowmageddon when snow happens here in Vancouver.
[58:48.370 --> 58:51.370]  We're like the one part of Canada that doesn't get snow.
[58:51.370 --> 58:54.370]  And then when it does, it's like an absolute catastrophe.
[58:54.370 --> 59:00.370]  And we're supposed to get another pretty heavy couple dumps of snow too, and it's supposed to stick.
[59:00.370 --> 59:01.370]  So it's been interesting.
[59:01.370 --> 59:08.370]  I've had to bash out my greenhouse a couple of times to try and maintain it as best I can.
[59:08.370 --> 59:09.370]  No, for sure.
[59:09.370 --> 59:15.370]  But I would like to talk about some of the things that we've been doing over the course of the year and the upcoming things we've got going on.
[59:15.370 --> 59:23.370]  Obviously, we got involved with you because we've been heavily pushing our lighting system this year that we went to market with.
[59:23.370 --> 59:26.370]  So we have the LED-1 automatic grow light.
[59:26.370 --> 59:31.370]  You've been using one of those lights, London, and then got a few LPs out in Canada now using some.
[59:31.370 --> 59:37.370]  We've got our U.S. team still in the middle of Oklahoma, out in Maine.
[59:37.370 --> 59:41.370]  We're looking at a few newer states, Michigan and New York, to get some of them out.
[59:41.370 --> 59:42.370]  So things are looking good.
[59:42.370 --> 59:47.370]  I even had a call yesterday about a grower in Thailand who wants to purchase some of those lights.
[59:47.370 --> 59:48.370]  So we're doing quite well.
[59:48.370 --> 59:51.370]  And we're also going to be doing some research in the new year.
[59:51.370 --> 59:55.370]  We got a Mitacs application out to a couple of universities.
[59:55.370 --> 59:58.370]  We've got a few responses on to do some lighting research.
[59:58.370 --> 01:00:10.370]  So that's something that we're really excited about because I really want to push the agenda on LED lighting and different spectrums and different intensities and durations and their effects on cannabis.
[01:00:10.370 --> 01:00:14.370]  So we're going to be hopefully starting a research product in the new year regarding some lighting.
[01:00:14.370 --> 01:00:18.370]  And we're doing some presentations, too.
[01:00:18.370 --> 01:00:35.370]  So, you know, I was talking even to John after the show today, and John was interested in maybe doing some kind of formal presentation or some video and some more content of the different effects that he's experienced with his collection of lighting data as well.
[01:00:35.370 --> 01:00:42.370]  So lots to do in the lighting sphere, and I'm very excited to be part of it and understanding it and learning it.
[01:00:42.370 --> 01:00:43.370]  So we've got that on top.
[01:00:43.370 --> 01:00:47.370]  So if anybody wants to know more about lighting or even wants to look at our lights, they're great.
[01:00:47.370 --> 01:00:50.370]  And then they're half off in BC with all the rebates.
[01:00:50.370 --> 01:00:52.370]  So that's some of the good stuff that we're doing.
[01:00:52.370 --> 01:01:03.370]  And then the second part now is that we finally, we're finally, well, we're still stuck on our building at our big facility because, you know, the ALR and the ALC and municipalities suck.
[01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:08.370]  But right now we've got a partnership going on with a processor.
[01:01:08.370 --> 01:01:15.370]  So we're going to be starting to process some weed starting in January with a processing license out here in the Okanagan.
[01:01:15.370 --> 01:01:24.370]  And we've been working with our trade group, the BC Farmers Craft Co-op, who is trying to put together a distribution system.
[01:01:24.370 --> 01:01:30.370]  So, you know, we've got 80 cultivators in our co-op, and we've got another 30 processors.
[01:01:30.370 --> 01:01:42.370]  So we're trying to build upon the BC government's direct delivery model and some other organizations such as Weed Pool to basically get weed into the retailers when it's fresh.
[01:01:42.370 --> 01:01:51.370]  Right. Get the good stuff into the retailers, build up some brands here in BC and create a model that cannabis distribution is not seen anywhere else in the world.
[01:01:51.370 --> 01:01:55.370]  So hopefully we're going to get that up and running coming in the new year.
[01:01:55.370 --> 01:02:01.370]  That's going to be happening as well as we also have the summit coming up.
[01:02:01.370 --> 01:02:05.370]  So this April, April 21st to 23rd, we have the BC Craft Farmers Co-op.
[01:02:05.370 --> 01:02:15.370]  And that's where I met some lovely people that I've made good networks in and here in BC especially.
[01:02:15.370 --> 01:02:21.370]  And not only are we looking at folks in BC here, but we're also looking for folks all across the country that come to our summit.
[01:02:21.370 --> 01:02:25.370]  Last year was a blast. This year should be even better than last year.
[01:02:25.370 --> 01:02:31.370]  And it's a good place to have community and to meet your fellow folks in the cannabis industry.
[01:02:31.370 --> 01:02:40.370]  So just a few things that I'm excited for at least in the coming new year and excited to do some new things and just putting the word out to anybody else doing similar things.
[01:02:40.370 --> 01:02:46.370]  We'd love to hear more about what you're doing and hear more about what the community has going on.
[01:02:51.010 --> 01:02:53.010]  Awesome, Jonathan.
[01:02:53.010 --> 01:02:57.010]  Hey, who's there?
[01:02:57.010 --> 01:03:05.000]  Sorry, my thing's really slow.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.000]  Apparently it is glitching. Is someone talking? I can't see the screen properly right now.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:17.020]  I do hear an open mic. Take your mic if you can, people.
[01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:20.020]  Awesome. Thank you, Jonathan. That's been...
[01:03:20.020 --> 01:03:22.020]  Perfect.
[01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:26.020]  So I mean, like, I'm going to be I'm going to try and be at the summit.
[01:03:26.020 --> 01:03:31.020]  I'm excited to see that. It was a fantastic show last year. We were there on location last year.
[01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:37.020]  I don't know what the panel thinks about camping, but I think we should all try and get together.
[01:03:37.020 --> 01:03:38.020]  I'm in!
[01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:42.020]  There you go, Dr. Anubis. That's you. Hey, Dr. Anna.
[01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:47.020]  I love camping! I'm in!
[01:03:47.020 --> 01:03:50.020]  In what? What's going on?
[01:03:50.020 --> 01:03:54.020]  Do you want me to tell? You tell!
[01:03:54.020 --> 01:03:58.020]  What's going on? Dr. Anubis, can you hear me?
[01:03:58.020 --> 01:03:59.020]  Yeah.
[01:03:59.020 --> 01:04:04.020]  What are we telling? Oh, we want... No, no, no. We're not there yet, but we should try and be on...
[01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:07.020]  No, I'm camping. I want to go camping.
[01:04:07.020 --> 01:04:11.020]  So, yeah, I want to go camping, too. So Dr. Anubis is going to come out to the Unicorn Cup.
[01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:14.020]  I'm going to be at the Unicorn Cup. I know Jonathan's going to be at the Unicorn Cup.
[01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:18.020]  I know Dennis and Shannon are going to be at the Unicorn Cup.
[01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:22.020]  I know Johnny's been talking about coming to the Unicorn Cup.
[01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:29.020]  You know, Dr. Mark, I'm sure we could figure out a fun place for you to come along and join us for the Unicorn Cup
[01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:32.020]  if you'd like to come up in August for that as well.
[01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:35.020]  Sure.
[01:04:35.020 --> 01:04:39.020]  As well as a few other people. And pretty much all the other people on this panel.
[01:04:39.020 --> 01:04:44.020]  We should have a lot of fun, but we're a little bit off of that. We'll talk about that a little bit later.
[01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:49.020]  But we are at the roundabout of the hour, so I don't want to impress it too long.
[01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:56.020]  It is Christmas season. It is time to be joyous and be with your family and do that type of thing.
[01:04:56.020 --> 01:04:59.020]  And so I want to give you guys an opportunity to do that.
[01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:03.020]  But does anybody, before we do, and we will be back in the new year,
[01:05:03.020 --> 01:05:09.020]  we are going to be rethinking potentially the frequency of shows exactly when we'll be coming back.
[01:05:09.020 --> 01:05:14.020]  But we'll let people know about that coming into the new year.
[01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:19.020]  But what I want to hear back from people, and if you have the opportunity to comment in the chat
[01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:23.020]  or to shoot me a message personally through the content as well,
[01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:26.020]  is what's going on and what you would like to see in the new year.
[01:05:26.020 --> 01:05:29.020]  Who are some of the doctors that you would like to see dig into?
[01:05:29.020 --> 01:05:35.020]  I for one really want to see Reggie Dardino on here and have a great conversation.
[01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:39.020]  Like have an in-depth genetics and bring in like, have you lead a doctor,
[01:05:39.020 --> 01:05:44.020]  Dr. Anubis, have like Reggie Dardino and like Dr. Philip Henry and like,
[01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:48.020]  and you know, like a couple other people come in and have a great conversation
[01:05:48.020 --> 01:05:53.020]  on top of the usual group of suspects that are in there as well.
[01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:56.020]  So we are getting to the end of the hour.
[01:05:56.020 --> 01:06:02.020]  So does anybody have anything they want to chat, bring up or announce that's coming up in the new year to keep an eye on?
[01:06:02.020 --> 01:06:04.020]  Go ahead, Dr. Anubis.
[01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:09.020]  So I just wanted, so I was just in California at a, it was a pretty small conference,
[01:06:09.020 --> 01:06:16.020]  very sciencey and very cultivating, like, but it wasn't like a B2B.
[01:06:16.020 --> 01:06:19.020]  It was more like an informative, like get everybody together,
[01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:24.020]  let's bridge the gap between science and cultivator kind of situation,
[01:06:24.020 --> 01:06:28.020]  specifically geared towards California growers.
[01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:35.020]  And it was a really awesome conference, but I hosted a panel that was, the topic was genetics,
[01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:37.020]  which is a really big topic.
[01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:38.020]  So it was hard.
[01:06:38.020 --> 01:06:43.020]  And Lynn and I, I remember like asking you like, what the, what am I going to ask?
[01:06:43.020 --> 01:06:46.020]  Like, what, how do I focus?
[01:06:46.020 --> 01:06:48.020]  But the panel was really awesome.
[01:06:48.020 --> 01:06:57.020]  It was Wendy Kornberg from the Gangier program and Mojave Richmond from Breeders Best.
[01:06:57.020 --> 01:07:01.020]  Todd McCormick, wait, is that right?
[01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:05.020]  Yes, Todd McCormick.
[01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:09.020]  And who else was it?
[01:07:09.020 --> 01:07:17.020]  Oh, Evelyn from, is it my, now I'm going to get that name.
[01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:23.020]  I've got the Leafworks and George Workman.
[01:07:23.020 --> 01:07:25.020]  Anyway, it was a really great panel.
[01:07:25.020 --> 01:07:30.020]  And we had two different meetings, like Zoom meetings before we even did the panel.
[01:07:30.020 --> 01:07:32.020]  Both were at least an hour long.
[01:07:32.020 --> 01:07:39.020]  Then we had a two-hour long panel, then just talking like amongst ourselves, you know, in a social setting.
[01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:42.020]  Freaking amazing conversations with these people.
[01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:46.020]  I think that inviting, I know Wendy has come on before,
[01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:52.020]  but I think inviting some of the folks that I met from California in that setting would be super amazing too.
[01:07:52.020 --> 01:07:56.020]  So I have some ideas for guests.
[01:07:56.020 --> 01:08:07.020]  But I like that, that we, you know, the first half of the year was very cultivator interest heavy.
[01:08:07.020 --> 01:08:14.020]  And then like, I don't know when, but like we started branching out into other avenues of the cannabis industry.
[01:08:14.020 --> 01:08:17.020]  Because as we all know, the cannabis industry is not limited to cultivation.
[01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:19.020]  There's a whole lot of arms.
[01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:29.020]  And I really love that diversity of topics that we started to branch out into.
[01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:39.020]  And I think that also is very, you know, like it's so much more interesting for our listeners.
[01:08:39.020 --> 01:08:44.020]  And because, you know, not everybody wants or has the capacity to grow.
[01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:52.020]  And so some of these other topics are very interesting to lovers of the plant.
[01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:55.020]  So I don't know if that made any sense.
[01:08:55.020 --> 01:08:58.020]  Anna, I got to say one other thing too.
[01:08:58.020 --> 01:09:01.020]  London, you know what Anna has been doing too?
[01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:13.020]  She's been doing some of my work out on LinkedIn, keeping these hemp slinging cowboys from understanding what the letter of the law means down here in the US.
[01:09:13.020 --> 01:09:22.020]  So while, yeah, hemp, industrial hemp is defined as 0.3% THC or greater.
[01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:32.020]  These folks think that high THC cannabis, because it has low amounts of decarboxylated THC actually qualify as hemp.
[01:09:32.020 --> 01:09:37.020]  And it's pretty risky because these folks are just selling stuff just right out on the Internet.
[01:09:37.020 --> 01:09:41.020]  You know, again, that crazy hemp loophole that we have.
[01:09:42.020 --> 01:10:03.020]  So Anna, thank you so much for keeping that story straight, because I think, yeah, people can get lulled into a risky situation by assuming that that's legal by the Farm Bill, which we all know high THC cannabis or high THC cannabis is marijuana.
[01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:11.020]  It's stuff that needs to be regulated and done in a legal framework.
[01:10:13.020 --> 01:10:24.020]  I'm so glad to see, Mark, that you're following my plight with some of these LinkedIn folks, because really it's kind of dangerous.
[01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:26.020]  I don't want anybody to get in trouble.
[01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:29.020]  I, at the heart of my soul, am a good girl.
[01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:40.020]  And working in the cannabis industry, frankly, is not anything that anyone would have ever seen me doing because, well, it's illegal.
[01:10:40.020 --> 01:10:49.020]  And I am also very boring as a rule follower.
[01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:51.020]  Like I take things very literally.
[01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:52.020]  No, that's good.
[01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:55.020]  No, that's not boring.
[01:10:55.020 --> 01:10:56.020]  That's not boring at all.
[01:10:56.020 --> 01:11:05.020]  That just means that you're taking the responsibility of other people's money seriously, because it's not your money.
[01:11:05.020 --> 01:11:06.020]  It's not my money.
[01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:12.020]  We're investing it for other people and making sure that they're not doing things that are going to get them in trouble.
[01:11:12.020 --> 01:11:14.020]  We're taking really bad advice.
[01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:18.020]  That one attorney, what's his name?
[01:11:18.020 --> 01:11:26.020]  Rod Kite, I think, is basically like, well, it has less than 0.3% THC, so therefore, you know.
[01:11:26.020 --> 01:11:31.020]  He's like, technically, if you read the language, it says this.
[01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:34.020]  However, I wouldn't recommend it.
[01:11:34.020 --> 01:11:36.020]  It's basically what he's saying.
[01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:42.020]  Like, yeah, as it stands right now, you're probably going to be OK.
[01:11:42.020 --> 01:11:48.020]  However, I wouldn't recommend it because it's still like not a good idea.
[01:11:48.020 --> 01:11:52.020]  You have to understand risk mitigation in the cannabis industry today.
[01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:54.020]  This is something you don't want to do.
[01:11:54.020 --> 01:12:05.020]  You know, a lot of people on the panel here are in Canada, Canada land, which I don't know if this is true or not.
[01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:21.020]  But my understanding is that cannabis like THC type cannabis, well, cannabis for consumption and cannabis for industrial purposes like hemp are regulated completely differently than they are in the United States.
[01:12:21.020 --> 01:12:23.020]  This is like a whole other topic.
[01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:25.020]  Maybe we should have a show on this.
[01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:27.020]  Well, it's a little bit different.
[01:12:27.020 --> 01:12:29.020]  Like hemp is treated like you got that 0.3.
[01:12:29.020 --> 01:12:30.020]  Like we have a hemp license.
[01:12:30.020 --> 01:12:32.020]  We grow hemp here in the Okanagan.
[01:12:32.020 --> 01:12:40.020]  And the minute it's it's hot, it's considered it's considered the the the scheduled cannabis rate like where you now are.
[01:12:40.020 --> 01:12:45.020]  It's no longer considered hemp and you have to follow all the other rules as part of the cannabis act.
[01:12:45.020 --> 01:12:46.020]  Right.
[01:12:46.020 --> 01:12:53.020]  So but you can start out with hemp and then pivot to like they won't make you destroy the crop like they do here.
[01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:54.020]  Oh, no, no, no.
[01:12:55.020 --> 01:13:08.020]  Technically, unless you're managing it now as cannabis, like technically that initial crop, you would technically have to destroy it because you legally never grew it appropriately because you started it at 10 and that's it.
[01:13:08.020 --> 01:13:18.020]  And but, you know, obviously there's things that go on, especially if you're in a process and a processor can do different types of things now, especially if the THC was higher than 0.3.
[01:13:18.020 --> 01:13:20.020]  But, you know, that's another story.
[01:13:21.020 --> 01:13:25.020]  This seems like such a big topic to bring up at the end of a show.
[01:13:25.020 --> 01:13:26.020]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:13:26.020 --> 01:13:29.020]  This is a topic for a show in the New York or London.
[01:13:29.020 --> 01:13:30.020]  Exactly.
[01:13:30.020 --> 01:13:33.020]  They are two separate licenses, though.
[01:13:33.020 --> 01:13:42.020]  Yeah, I just wanted to make sure that Anna got credit for speaking up on this issue because I think it's a really important issue to speak up on.
[01:13:42.020 --> 01:13:43.020]  So thank you, Anna.
[01:13:43.020 --> 01:13:44.020]  That's all.
[01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:46.020]  Thank you, Dr. Mark.
[01:13:47.020 --> 01:13:53.020]  And I do get beaten down quite heavily on the social media all the time, but I just got to fight the good fight, you know?
[01:13:53.020 --> 01:13:55.020]  You always you're like a bulldog.
[01:13:55.020 --> 01:13:58.020]  You're like out there just getting into all the fights.
[01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:03.020]  Hey, London and everybody.
[01:14:04.020 --> 01:14:05.020]  Well, we're still here.
[01:14:05.020 --> 01:14:15.020]  And just to keep things moving along, there's going to be a really a series of events happening in the United States in the month of February.
[01:14:15.020 --> 01:14:21.020]  And these these are going to be conferences that are that are put on by me and a few other people.
[01:14:22.020 --> 01:14:30.020]  We're bringing young saying Joe from from Korea to come talk about his farming system that he compiled.
[01:14:30.020 --> 01:14:40.020]  And young saying Joe is the son of Master Joe, who is the man who is responsible for bringing and compiling the Korean natural farming system.
[01:14:40.020 --> 01:14:49.020]  And his son developed the system along the same kind of tenets and philosophy of his father's system.
[01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:51.020]  But, you know, it's really different as well.
[01:14:51.020 --> 01:15:03.020]  And he's going to be doing four conferences, one in California, one in upstate New York, one in Austin or somewhere in Texas.
[01:15:03.020 --> 01:15:06.020]  And then I believe in Maryland.
[01:15:07.020 --> 01:15:10.020]  And like I said, those are all going to be in the month of February.
[01:15:10.020 --> 01:15:15.020]  And there's flyers and links floating around online.
[01:15:15.020 --> 01:15:26.020]  So, you know, you'll probably see them, but it's definitely something to look out for if you're interested in regenerative organic cultivation of anything,
[01:15:26.020 --> 01:15:36.020]  whether it's cannabis, whether it's, you know, hemp, which is still cannabis, or, you know, fruits and vegetables.
[01:15:36.020 --> 01:15:38.020]  So, yeah, it's something to look out for.
[01:15:38.020 --> 01:15:41.020]  It's going to be really amazing events.
[01:15:41.020 --> 01:15:44.020]  And yeah, I just wanted to let everybody know that was going to be going.
[01:15:46.020 --> 01:15:48.020]  Don't forget cat mint.
[01:15:51.020 --> 01:15:53.020]  Fucking cat mint.
[01:15:53.020 --> 01:15:55.020]  Hey, who's cat man?
[01:15:55.020 --> 01:15:57.020]  Cat mint.
[01:15:59.020 --> 01:16:02.020]  Catnip. Cat mint. It's a mint.
[01:16:02.020 --> 01:16:03.020]  Catnip?
[01:16:03.020 --> 01:16:05.020]  Yeah, it's a mint.
[01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:07.020]  I don't know any cat farmers personally, but...
[01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:10.020]  Google it. The Patek Cateria. There you go.
[01:16:10.020 --> 01:16:11.020]  There you go.
[01:16:14.020 --> 01:16:16.020]  M-I-N-T. Mint.
[01:16:18.020 --> 01:16:22.020]  Yeah, catnip is kind of slang. It's cat mint.
[01:16:22.020 --> 01:16:24.020]  It's, yeah, I guess.
[01:16:24.020 --> 01:16:26.020]  A couple species.
[01:16:26.020 --> 01:16:32.020]  But catnip is the dried herbal product. It's kind of like kitty weed.
[01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:38.020]  And just like people, not all cats like cat mint.
[01:16:41.020 --> 01:16:49.020]  I got some heavy duty oil that we get from the steam distillation of the herb itself.
[01:16:49.020 --> 01:16:53.020]  And I have not seen a cat not respond to the oil.
[01:16:53.020 --> 01:16:57.020]  Oil is very concentrated as opposed to what it is in the plant.
[01:16:57.020 --> 01:17:00.020]  So maybe it's just a matter of dose.
[01:17:00.020 --> 01:17:04.020]  I've had a couple of cats where, like, I have two cats.
[01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:07.020]  One goes crazy and one's like, nope.
[01:17:08.020 --> 01:17:11.020]  And will just walk away from it. Doesn't like it.
[01:17:11.020 --> 01:17:14.020]  Anna, reach out to me. I'll get you some.
[01:17:14.020 --> 01:17:16.020]  Probably some kind of genetic thing, huh, Anna?
[01:17:18.020 --> 01:17:25.020]  Anna, reach out to me with your address and I'll get you some high potency cat mint oil.
[01:17:27.020 --> 01:17:29.020]  This sounds like one shady deal.
[01:17:29.020 --> 01:17:31.020]  The kitty dabs.
[01:17:31.020 --> 01:17:34.020]  Mark's handing out the kitty dabs. The kitty turps.
[01:17:34.020 --> 01:17:38.020]  Can you put them straight into your extracts?
[01:17:39.020 --> 01:17:46.020]  I can tell you when I have the bottle out, we have two cats and there's one cat that's definitely more reactive to it.
[01:17:46.020 --> 01:17:48.020]  He starts going crazy.
[01:17:48.020 --> 01:17:51.020]  Like the bottle itself, the essence of the oil.
[01:17:51.020 --> 01:17:55.020]  And the oil itself is very loud and very herbaceous.
[01:17:55.020 --> 01:18:02.020]  It's not very, you know, if you're not familiar with that odor, it's not very nice.
[01:18:04.020 --> 01:18:07.020]  So I want to take a moment and like give it to Steve.
[01:18:07.020 --> 01:18:09.020]  Were you trying to say something important?
[01:18:13.340 --> 01:18:18.340]  Yeah, I was just going to say it's been really cool to see all the new communities this year pop up.
[01:18:18.340 --> 01:18:27.340]  I saw a new Grow community, you know, Grow meeting, local, you know, local Grow meetings in Oklahoma City.
[01:18:27.340 --> 01:18:30.340]  That was really cool to kind of help be a part of.
[01:18:30.340 --> 01:18:32.340]  And then also, same thing out here in Thailand.
[01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:36.340]  It's been really cool to kind of see a lot of the, there aren't that many of us Westerners out here.
[01:18:36.340 --> 01:18:39.340]  Well, there is, but they're not all from the States.
[01:18:39.340 --> 01:18:47.340]  But it's been cool to kind of see the, like, you know how, just like we're doing now where we have like meetings on talking about breeding and all that stuff.
[01:18:47.340 --> 01:18:52.340]  A lot of people out here, the few Americans out here bringing that culture here.
[01:18:52.340 --> 01:18:59.340]  And it's been really cool to see so many different little local cannabis communities, probably more than any year I've seen in the past.
[01:18:59.340 --> 01:19:21.340]  So I guess that was my big takeaway for the year was just that there's been so much more reinvigoration and people starting small local communities rather than trying to rely on some of the more toxic, you know, bigger internet communities that have been maybe not the best source of information or a lot of people maybe, you know, selling out or, you know, not necessarily supporting the community anymore.
[01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:28.340]  It's been nice to see a lot, you know, kind of the, as a response to that a lot of people spawning their own smaller communities.
[01:19:28.340 --> 01:19:36.340]  So just wanted to kind of mention that because it's been, I've never seen so many of the smaller little grow clubs and stuff pop up in such a short period of time.
[01:19:36.340 --> 01:19:39.340]  It's been really great.
[01:19:39.340 --> 01:19:44.340]  That's what it's all about. Supporting that local community, supporting your local people.
[01:19:44.340 --> 01:20:05.340]  That's what one of the divining point of most of these shows has been around when it comes down to it is trying to bring yourself a little bit more local, support your local, understand what happens when you purchase, when you make decisions, understanding, you know, all the other factors that come into, you know, what happens when A, things go federally legal,
[01:20:06.340 --> 01:20:17.340]  but B, when we get together and communicate and collaborate and try and move forward as a community, we've had some awesome, awesome strides over the last year and it's been an incredible year.
[01:20:17.340 --> 01:20:31.340]  So on that very, very positive note, I'd like to say thank you to each and every one of you for being here and coming in on the show and being part of the conversation and helping to move this forward each and every week.
[01:20:31.340 --> 01:20:38.340]  And I'd like to thank each and every person in the audience as well for coming and enjoying the show and being here each and every week.
[01:20:38.340 --> 01:20:43.340]  It's been a lot of fun and we've got a lot of great content coming for the new year.
[01:20:44.340 --> 01:20:55.340]  I'm excited for a little bit of a break, but I'm more excited to be able to take some time and really dig in and prepare some really awesome content and prepare some really awesome experiences for you guys to be a part of.
[01:20:55.340 --> 01:21:01.340]  Thanks again to each and every one of you and hopefully we can see you again next time on the Dank Hour panel.
[01:21:01.340 --> 01:21:04.340]  Happy holidays, as it were, right?
[01:21:04.340 --> 01:21:06.340]  Happy holidays.
[01:21:06.340 --> 01:21:08.340]  Woohoo!
[01:21:08.340 --> 01:21:11.340]  Happy holidays! I love you all!
[01:21:11.340 --> 01:21:13.340]  Happy holidays. Thank you, London. Thank you, everyone.
[01:21:13.340 --> 01:21:14.340]  Bye!
[01:21:14.340 --> 01:21:17.340]  Merry Christmas. Happy New Year.
[01:21:17.340 --> 01:21:19.340]  Thank you, everyone.
[01:21:19.340 --> 01:21:21.340]  It's been amazing.
[01:21:23.340 --> 01:21:26.340]  Hope to see you in Vancouver in January.
[01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:27.340]  That's listed.
[01:21:27.340 --> 01:21:29.340]  In August.
[01:21:29.340 --> 01:21:34.340]  And also the Unicorn Cup. I won't miss it this year.
[01:21:34.340 --> 01:21:36.340]  Awesome.
[01:21:36.340 --> 01:21:38.340]  Take care, guys.
[01:21:38.340 --> 01:21:39.340]  Thank you.
[01:21:39.340 --> 01:21:42.340]  Bye!
