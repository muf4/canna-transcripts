[00:00.000 --> 00:05.360]  All right, we're here with Jacques and Amy from Newcomb Family Farms. Jacques, Amy, hi, how's it going?
[00:06.080 --> 00:12.080]  Good, good, excellent. Thanks for coming out. I know it's a trek for you guys, but I appreciate
[00:12.080 --> 00:19.520]  it. So let's talk a little bit about your background and maybe give the listeners some
[00:19.520 --> 00:25.440]  context. You're originally vegetable fruit farmers, traditional farmers, then you got into cannabis.
[00:25.440 --> 00:30.720]  I don't know the details exactly, so maybe let me know how you guys got started in cannabis.
[00:30.720 --> 00:39.680]  Yeah, well, it's kind of funny. Yeah, 28 years ago, we started growing peaches and tomatoes
[00:39.680 --> 00:46.560]  and lettuce, and that's been our sole source of income from the beginning. But here I am,
[00:46.560 --> 00:53.280]  a certified organic long-haired guy in Humboldt County. And so every time I tell people like,
[00:53.280 --> 00:58.400]  yeah, I'm a peach farmer in Humboldt County, certified organic, you know, and people would
[00:58.400 --> 01:05.600]  just kind of nod and go, sure, sure. So after being like stereotyped for most of my farming
[01:05.600 --> 01:10.720]  career, as I was like, always like, everybody's like, that's why he's successful. He's a dope
[01:10.720 --> 01:17.360]  grower, you know, grows weed. And it wasn't true. And so that's funny. Yeah. And so we finally got
[01:17.360 --> 01:22.400]  to this point where like with Lee, you know, like the medical legalization happened, and
[01:22.400 --> 01:27.200]  we didn't jump on it. We were like, no, no, no, we're, we're, we're fruit farmers. And then,
[01:27.760 --> 01:34.320]  but that stereotype or that, like, everybody had me like pigeonholed. And so then when recreational
[01:34.320 --> 01:38.960]  came around, we kind of looked at each other. And there had been the property we owned, there had
[01:38.960 --> 01:46.640]  been a like an illegal, you know, patch in the back. And we just kind of looked at each other.
[01:46.640 --> 01:51.600]  And we were like, why not? It's a diversification for the farm. Like we grow everything else really
[01:51.600 --> 01:55.200]  beautifully. I'd love to see what we could do with that plant. Right. And we've both had a
[01:55.200 --> 02:00.720]  relationship with cannabis for, you know, since I was 12. Long time. Been growing it. Have you been
[02:00.720 --> 02:05.120]  growing it for that long? Backyard. Yeah, backyard. Backyard growing. Yeah. You know, just just for
[02:05.120 --> 02:11.920]  ourselves. And so we just like, we've been like, you know, tried to just stay totally white market
[02:11.920 --> 02:18.080]  and enjoy the plants. And because first couple of years, we just grew this amazing diversity,
[02:18.160 --> 02:24.320]  like through diversity of cannabis. Yeah. Yeah. And just really seeing like what the plant was
[02:24.320 --> 02:29.360]  capable of. For sure. Yeah. You got to test it out in your soil. In the soils. Yeah. The certified
[02:29.360 --> 02:35.200]  organic soil. You guys are in truly native soil. Yeah. It's beautiful bottom land. Yeah. You have
[02:35.200 --> 02:39.840]  really nice that little terrace. It's probably like the alluvial floodplain where it's like
[02:39.840 --> 02:44.880]  really high grade soil. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we on that same, you know, we with all of our other
[02:44.880 --> 02:51.360]  crops there, we rotate our crops and we'll grow melons, corn, carrots, like no water at all. You
[02:51.360 --> 02:56.080]  know, it's just like dry farm dry farm. Yeah. And so do you think does your cannabis require any?
[02:56.080 --> 03:01.040]  I mean, we water our cannabis, but like, it's really about like, what's your definition of
[03:01.040 --> 03:06.240]  dry farming? We water it so little. Minimum. Yeah. Yeah. And we use a drip. It's buried.
[03:07.360 --> 03:13.520]  And but yeah, it's we I think this year, we're actually put a meter on it. It's really the
[03:14.000 --> 03:20.080]  um, we'll go a month at a time without watering it. Amazing. Yeah, it's um,
[03:21.440 --> 03:26.800]  it's a beautiful crop. It's it's perfectly suited for our location. You guys have a perfect spot. I
[03:26.800 --> 03:31.920]  it's really nice. It's like that cuddly little terrace. There's high recharge rates from the
[03:31.920 --> 03:38.560]  groundwater coming through and it just helps elevate the water tables to where it seems like
[03:38.560 --> 03:42.720]  it keeps you know, the soil moisture so it's it's really beautiful. I love that spot.
[03:43.520 --> 03:47.440]  I'm just curious with the diversification of your other crops. I'm just for the record,
[03:47.440 --> 03:51.840]  how many different species of vegetables do you grow? Yeah, like I mean, it's a hard question.
[03:51.840 --> 03:56.320]  I don't know like we you know, with the like, with the you know, one thing that we committed to,
[03:56.320 --> 04:00.960]  like, we really enjoy, like growing the cannabis. But we also said when we started to do this,
[04:00.960 --> 04:05.760]  we were like, we can't not we can't not grow food and we can't slow down like we still have
[04:05.760 --> 04:10.640]  that commitment to feed our community. And that's what the farm is like based on is feeding our
[04:10.640 --> 04:18.800]  community, you know, healthy food, keep your community healthy. And so we still like, produce
[04:18.800 --> 04:25.600]  we actually produce more than we ever have. So we have like, peaches, we have 18 different varieties.
[04:25.600 --> 04:33.200]  Wow. fruit trees in general, we have like 1600 trees. Nice. So you know, and then the tomatoes
[04:33.200 --> 04:40.240]  20 different varieties. melons, eight different varieties, you know, so just corn and squash. Yeah,
[04:40.240 --> 04:46.240]  15 varieties of pluot. You know, do you do other root vegetables like potatoes or onions or carrots
[04:46.240 --> 04:51.440]  ever? Yeah, it depends every year. What we do is we watch and see how the rain falls, see where the
[04:51.440 --> 05:00.160]  how tall the cover crop gets. When is our last, you know, rain event, all that really tells us
[05:00.160 --> 05:04.320]  what we can grow interest. So some years when it's a really dry spring, it's like,
[05:04.320 --> 05:09.040]  okay, no carrots, you know, yeah, wet spring, great carrots. Interesting. So you're really,
[05:09.040 --> 05:16.640]  truly reading the cycles. Yeah, we have big plants of seed and big mason jars of pounds of seed.
[05:16.640 --> 05:21.680]  Oh, that's amazing. So and some years we don't use, you know, carrots, we don't grow them at all.
[05:21.680 --> 05:25.600]  And then the next year, it's a big year. So I feel like I want to talk to you. It's not the
[05:25.600 --> 05:33.040]  appropriate time to talk about carrot cross pollination, maybe afterwards. So as far as
[05:33.040 --> 05:38.560]  your canyons goes, I do find it interesting that you're in basically completely native soil.
[05:38.560 --> 05:43.040]  There's not many farms out there that are in sometimes it's mixed with potting soil sometimes,
[05:43.040 --> 05:48.080]  but to be in native soil, if you found any unique challenges with that, or if you feel like your
[05:48.080 --> 05:54.080]  plants like health wise have responded, I think that's been amazing. Only beneficial. Yeah, we
[05:55.040 --> 06:01.360]  like, I have to go to neighboring farms to see what diseases and pest infestations look like,
[06:01.360 --> 06:07.360]  like we don't, our plants like and we've learned this with with other things like the peach trees
[06:07.360 --> 06:16.880]  or the or the tomatoes, like, you know, when you start with good genetics, and you and especially
[06:16.880 --> 06:23.280]  like growing from seed, like you get that that plant really wants to have an authentic root system.
[06:24.320 --> 06:32.000]  And when you grow something that vital and that healthy, that's like 99% of, you know,
[06:32.000 --> 06:38.640]  keeping pests and disease away, you know, not getting greedy, not not pumping a plant with a
[06:38.640 --> 06:43.280]  lot of fertility. That's what I've noticed. I've basically noticed like essentially, when you get
[06:43.280 --> 06:47.840]  greedy, and you try to pump the plant with extra water, the root systems don't develop as much
[06:47.840 --> 06:51.840]  because they don't need to. And then if it dries out, the plant's going to suffer. Or if you
[06:51.840 --> 06:56.960]  conversely pump it with fertilizer, the plant grows too rapidly, where it's essentially immune
[06:56.960 --> 07:01.520]  system can't keep up with itself. And then it's attacked. Yep. And it also like with the root
[07:01.520 --> 07:05.600]  system, it'll if you put too much fertility in the root system grows a little because Oh,
[07:05.600 --> 07:10.160]  there's plenty here. I don't there's plenty of water right here, too. So the root system doesn't
[07:10.160 --> 07:15.440]  really go for it. Whereas like, with that native soil, you really want to, you know, you want to
[07:15.440 --> 07:21.120]  get it like, you want to get those roots searching. So you want to have nice, loose, porous, you know,
[07:21.120 --> 07:27.280]  we do like, we actually mulch all our beds in a permanent bed system. And we actually harvest the
[07:27.280 --> 07:33.920]  hay on the farm. Oh, that's beautiful. So you guys are actually closing the loop to that degree with
[07:33.920 --> 07:38.240]  mulch. So you're harvesting your hay. Is it on the same plot or that on your other farm? It's like
[07:38.240 --> 07:42.880]  in the same spot, same spot. Okay, so you're harvesting the hay and the hay is used for mulch
[07:42.880 --> 07:47.360]  for the cannabis. And the hay is actually the cover crop that we like get. So it's like,
[07:47.600 --> 07:52.640]  it's a black ride. Oh, yeah. So there's Yeah, something's like the vetch and the bell beans,
[07:52.640 --> 07:57.440]  they'll like melt into fertility really quickly. Whereas the oats and the rye,
[07:57.440 --> 08:01.040]  they provide layering. Yeah, there'll be a little more residual. It sounds like a really interesting
[08:01.040 --> 08:06.000]  bio biodiverse system using a cover crop is mulch. That's interesting. I haven't heard I mean,
[08:06.000 --> 08:10.240]  most of the times every time you hear of cover crop, it's always tilled in, right? You know,
[08:10.240 --> 08:15.600]  and I've definitely mulched some stuff, but I've only done I don't like using grasses. I didn't
[08:15.600 --> 08:20.480]  because they will regrow half the time. One it's scary too, because you might be incorporating like
[08:20.480 --> 08:26.720]  some perennial grass with rhizome. Right? That you never know what you're getting. So when you're
[08:26.720 --> 08:31.760]  actually bringing it from your own farm, you know, you know, that's really cool. Huh? That's really
[08:31.760 --> 08:37.600]  interesting. And do you feel like have you noticed like, you know, you're the terpene expression of
[08:37.600 --> 08:42.480]  the plants are better because of these management practices like or just used to it because that's
[08:42.560 --> 08:48.960]  kind of some of the feedback we're getting is that the terpene are really stellar. Nice. That's
[08:48.960 --> 08:53.840]  awesome. We're just you know, we're just working. Yeah, it's really cool. And you guys been doing
[08:53.840 --> 09:01.440]  since 2018 1717. Cool. Right? Yeah, that's awesome. That's really exciting. There's probably a bunch
[09:01.440 --> 09:06.480]  more questions I'll think of later. But I live like five minutes away. I've always thought you
[09:06.480 --> 09:13.440]  know, if we if we didn't grow cannabis in a in a commercial way, I would still want plants around
[09:13.440 --> 09:17.520]  the farm. Like one of the things that I've been amazed at is it's the interaction with the
[09:17.520 --> 09:23.440]  environment that that plant has and the beneficial insects. It brings in is just like, it's a benefit
[09:23.440 --> 09:28.800]  to the whole farm. Like it's I would love it's too bad that we actually have to keep it in this very
[09:28.800 --> 09:33.760]  controlled contained like you put it here. Yeah, I'd actually love to have a couple plants there.
[09:34.720 --> 09:39.040]  Like I love spread that love. I've been doing some auto flowers with Humboldt seed the last
[09:39.040 --> 09:44.640]  few years. He's been giving me some and I've loved intercropping rooter root root vegetables
[09:44.640 --> 09:51.680]  with cannabis. I had this 50 foot row of carrots, just right next to the cannabis, the auto flowers
[09:51.680 --> 09:58.480]  and I was insane. I had no idea that the carrots all of the above ground growth could create such
[09:58.480 --> 10:04.160]  a bank for lady beetles. There are lady beetles, the whole row of carrots, and then they all
[10:04.160 --> 10:09.760]  reproduced on the auto flower leaves like and they all went from there. And the eggs were on
[10:09.760 --> 10:13.600]  the underside of all the auto flower. I was just like blown away with how to how amazing that
[10:13.600 --> 10:18.400]  intercropping system was. Of course, it required a lot of water and fertilization where I'm at.
[10:18.400 --> 10:24.640]  Unfortunately, we I got hit with the gravel bar of the river Terence had to implement some other
[10:24.640 --> 10:32.240]  practices, bringing in fertility with mulching. But anyways, so that's really I'm just really
[10:32.240 --> 10:37.200]  excited to hear you guys measure practice. It's a really beautiful example of closing the loop
[10:37.200 --> 10:42.160]  and creating more regenerative system that's like, you know, long term regenerative, not just
[10:42.160 --> 10:46.480]  sustainable. So we're trying right now we're actually doing this thing where we're, we're
[10:46.480 --> 10:54.240]  aging wood chips for about two years. And then we're putting other farm grown green manure cover
[10:54.240 --> 11:01.680]  crop, putting that in with the aged wood chips and trying to do like we're doing goat manure and
[11:01.680 --> 11:07.600]  chicken bedding. So chicken. Oh, yeah, that stuff's great. And we're putting that all in and making a
[11:07.600 --> 11:13.280]  like a bio complete compost using Elaine Ingham soil food web. Really? That's actually so that
[11:13.280 --> 11:18.560]  right now the fertility on the farm is actually 100% from the farm from the farm. So it really is
[11:18.560 --> 11:24.480]  closed loop. Try trying and you got you said goats. Yeah, you guys have goats. Yeah, yeah,
[11:24.480 --> 11:28.720]  goats are tricky. And that's really fascinating. Walter was talking about, you know, harvesting
[11:28.720 --> 11:32.880]  wood chips, and then letting them sit in the forest and they would collect the mycelium and
[11:32.880 --> 11:38.160]  then building but you guys are creating like, very unique biodynamics. Well, not biodynamic, but yeah,
[11:38.160 --> 11:42.720]  well, there's you know, the wood chips and the and the biology from the forest and the fungi and
[11:42.720 --> 11:47.280]  everything like that's a huge part of it. You got to grow what is it? What is the biodynamic compost
[11:47.280 --> 11:53.760]  yarrow, chamomile, valerian? Yeah, but yeah, that's and that's even more different. That's
[11:53.760 --> 12:00.560]  like a that's a dumb spiritual path. We grow all those plants in our beds. Yeah, the cannabis
[12:01.760 --> 12:06.080]  living plants all in. So there's living under Yeah, under the plants. There's inner there's
[12:06.080 --> 12:10.800]  herbs in a crop. And there is a ton of different kinds of valerian and yarrow. It's beautiful.
[12:10.800 --> 12:14.880]  Those things like in underneath the plants. Oh, that's really cool. That would make you guys have
[12:14.880 --> 12:19.920]  I would love to see photos of that. If you ever do take photos. I would put them on. Yeah, yeah,
[12:19.920 --> 12:24.800]  yeah. That'd be really cool. Yeah, that's beautiful. Right on. All right. Well, I mean,
[12:24.800 --> 12:28.080]  I feel like I asked you a ton of I bet you have tons of really cool management questions,
[12:28.800 --> 12:33.680]  methodology questions that I could ask you, but I guess for time sake, maybe let's think about
[12:35.440 --> 12:41.120]  your what do you think would be the one thing you'd change in the industry? Like if you had
[12:41.120 --> 12:45.680]  to change something with education or regulation? You've been asking all the farmers like, what do
[12:45.680 --> 12:51.840]  you feel like would most you know, create the highest level of impact with for the small cannabis
[12:51.840 --> 12:57.200]  first regulation then education? Sure. Yeah, yeah, take less barriers to entry and then,
[12:57.760 --> 13:02.960]  you know, then take the time to educate. I think I think they both think education. There's been
[13:02.960 --> 13:09.840]  a lot of talk today about like education for the dispensary level where THC shouldn't be as
[13:09.840 --> 13:15.440]  important understanding or terpene terpene secondary, minor cannabinoids and all of that
[13:15.440 --> 13:20.960]  in education. Then for the regulation side, there's been all talk of direct to consumer sales.
[13:21.600 --> 13:26.880]  That was been pretty hot. And then obviously eliminate cultivation taxes and things. Yeah,
[13:26.880 --> 13:35.280]  I think something that might be unique to us is like we've been exploring the new O cow or O can
[13:35.280 --> 13:43.360]  O cow. And yeah, and so the organic cannabis and that's really hard because we're just a farm. And
[13:43.360 --> 13:49.680]  so we need the distributor to be certified. You need the processor to be certified. Oh, really?
[13:49.680 --> 13:54.480]  And if they're not, wow, they can't they can't put that sticker on the product.
[13:54.480 --> 14:01.280]  And processor also. Yeah, everybody, everybody in the line. Wow. So so the fact that we could get
[14:01.280 --> 14:08.320]  certified and pay all this money to be certified, our cannabis would never never say organic or
[14:08.320 --> 14:15.600]  Wow. Does it do that in other agricultural crops? Well, you know, we've been certified organic,
[14:15.600 --> 14:20.160]  you know, since the beginning. And since the NLP, the National Organic Program, and
[14:21.280 --> 14:28.720]  and we're certified, our farm is certified by CCOF. And back when it started, there were certain
[14:28.720 --> 14:37.120]  things that like, they made allowances for things like you couldn't get organic seed. So they were
[14:37.120 --> 14:42.720]  like, okay, if you can't find organic seed, you can use a conventional seed. Just grow organic.
[14:43.600 --> 14:47.520]  Right. And as long as you are growing organic, and you could still call that, you know, if you grew
[14:47.520 --> 14:53.440]  a tomato from a conventional seed, you could you could call it organic. And so like little tweaks
[14:53.440 --> 14:56.880]  to the rules like that make all the difference. And so right now, they're trying to get this
[14:56.880 --> 15:01.920]  organic certification for cannabis off the ground. But they're being so militant about it.
[15:01.920 --> 15:06.240]  Yeah, it's like that it's one foot in our right. And here, you know, everybody, I'm sure has been
[15:06.240 --> 15:10.800]  talking about how the small cannabis farmer is hurting right now. Yeah. And so here's something
[15:10.800 --> 15:16.000]  you could really here's a certification that could really distinguish your crop. Absolutely. And it's
[15:16.000 --> 15:20.880]  like, and you can't go anywhere with it. Interesting. Wow, that's really lame. I had no idea that
[15:20.880 --> 15:25.360]  processing and distribution also don't forget, don't forget, they make they've not only grow
[15:25.360 --> 15:29.680]  really good cannabis, but they also grow really good peaches. Speaking of cannabis,
[15:29.680 --> 15:36.480]  actually, do you have samples? Can we get some samples? We can talk about the different things.
[15:36.480 --> 15:47.360]  That's the sapphire. Okay, the sapphire sue 7% THC 22% CBD. Now that sounds pretty amazing.
[15:47.360 --> 15:51.360]  I'm definitely as I get older, with all my sports related injuries, and my just like
[15:51.360 --> 15:57.440]  joint sort of I'm leaning more towards the higher CBD stuff. And that's a one to one. Oh,
[15:57.440 --> 16:04.240]  man. Well, that that that test was is basically kind of like a two to seems like a three to one.
[16:05.120 --> 16:09.600]  But that one tests kind of it varies, but it varies depending on Yeah, sure. Yeah. The time
[16:09.600 --> 16:15.680]  when it was tested. Oh my gosh, it smells so good. That's a bio vortex. This is a bio vortex
[16:15.680 --> 16:21.440]  strain. Yep. Sapphire sue. That's like the farm favorite. That's actually anybody who comes and
[16:21.440 --> 16:28.400]  tries that loves it. You guys are you just doing flower that for that one? That one is actually
[16:28.400 --> 16:36.480]  made into a BHO. Oh, you do? Yeah. Oh, but we didn't do it, but somebody else did it. But then
[16:37.520 --> 16:40.880]  that this year is going to be for pre rolls. Okay, yeah.
[16:41.840 --> 16:46.880]  Hmm. Yeah, that's one that's like, farm will always grow that one. It's such like the plant
[16:46.880 --> 16:52.400]  is so beautiful. That it just we couldn't not leave it off. Very easy to work with.
[16:54.560 --> 16:59.680]  Nice takes weather, like beautifully. Another thing about our farm is like there's there's
[16:59.680 --> 17:06.400]  nothing we rely entirely on beneficial insects and, and companion planning. Like there's beautiful.
[17:06.400 --> 17:10.800]  Yeah, there's nothing. This is probably why I've gotten it's like I must have gotten a download
[17:10.800 --> 17:16.960]  over the last few years, because that's what I'm in love with to use of an integrated system.
[17:16.960 --> 17:23.040]  Because we're diversified as a farm, we don't have to rely on one crop. So we've had years where the
[17:23.040 --> 17:29.440]  tomatoes you know, get blight, but the peaches save us, right. And we've had other years, you
[17:29.440 --> 17:34.800]  know that the peaches don't have a crop and the tomatoes save us or the melon save us. So really
[17:35.120 --> 17:44.240]  cannabis, it's like, my concern about smoking other people's weed is like, if they have to pull
[17:44.240 --> 17:49.920]  off that crop, they're going to do everything and anything. Yeah, pull off that crop. Yeah. And so
[17:49.920 --> 17:54.240]  with us, it's like, there'll be some I'm sure there'll be some year where there's nothing there.
[17:54.240 --> 17:59.120]  And that's okay. Because we've got all these other things that'll save the key.
[17:59.120 --> 18:04.880]  This is you guys are the shining model for the key for understanding diversity. It's true. You
[18:04.880 --> 18:09.760]  know, it's like, I mean, really people, that's the whole point. Diversificate biodiversity is
[18:09.760 --> 18:14.800]  the supreme ruler when you understand, if you're integrated, if you're integrated with all those
[18:14.800 --> 18:21.920]  systems, then you have the capacity for some to fail and still be, you know, say, and maintain
[18:21.920 --> 18:29.040]  your high standards. Yes, that's the we don't want to spray anything. Yeah. And like, it would not
[18:29.040 --> 18:33.760]  feel good to spray something. So we would rather deal with it differently. Do you guys feel like I
[18:33.760 --> 18:38.560]  mean, I could talk to you for hours probably what? All right. I know we're not supposed to get too
[18:38.560 --> 18:43.360]  deep. But what are your three or five favorite companion plants? Which ones do you like the most
[18:43.360 --> 18:50.480]  for attracting beneficials? Well, a list that's on my list. It's top of the list. And then and then
[18:51.200 --> 18:57.840]  this year, I was amazed at like the yarrow just kept flowering. It just loved the mulch in the
[18:57.840 --> 19:02.000]  bed system. I love the yarrow, but I feel like it's invasive a little. It creeps a little. But
[19:02.000 --> 19:07.280]  you know, just pull little edges of it out. It's not like it's not a plant that's like so hard.
[19:07.280 --> 19:11.680]  It's not like comfrey. Yeah. Yeah. And then another one. We would never plant comfrey in a can of comfrey.
[19:11.680 --> 19:16.960]  She won't let me. But another one is. It has its place. Yeah. But not in the cannabis. Okay.
[19:17.840 --> 19:23.440]  Another one is oregano. Oh, interesting. Awesome. Amazing. Thyme. Thyme. I love. We have a ton of
[19:23.440 --> 19:27.520]  oregano and thyme in our house too. I like oregano. And those are all antimicrobial. So if you think
[19:27.520 --> 19:31.840]  about it on a spiritual, like an essence level. Yeah, it's an essence biochemical. It's like has
[19:31.840 --> 19:36.960]  a biochemical suppression. I've done some research that shows it repels insects, pests. They don't
[19:36.960 --> 19:41.120]  want to be around that. Yeah. And it's also got that small flower that a lot of the
[19:42.080 --> 19:47.600]  beneficials love. Yes. Oh my God. The honeybees too. And the bumblebees go nuts over it. That's
[19:47.600 --> 19:52.800]  cool. So, okay. Thyme, oregano, maybe one more. Throw one more. Rosemary. Rosemary. We have a lot
[19:52.800 --> 19:56.480]  of rosemary. Yeah. Yeah. You know, and you, the thing is, is you just come in and whack it and
[19:56.480 --> 20:00.640]  it's like, thank you. And it goes on to, you know, another, it'll bloom several times in a summer,
[20:00.640 --> 20:04.560]  which is really, Oh, it's funny. Cause I've never actually done that. So you can cut rosemary back.
[20:04.560 --> 20:08.640]  Oh yeah. Yeah. We cut it way back. And it just like rose. And then we have some other, we have
[20:08.640 --> 20:14.080]  some, like whether it's day lilies or that, that I'm still like, I don't know what it does, but
[20:14.080 --> 20:20.480]  it's beautiful. Or the Japanese anemone is another one that's in the patch. And that's nice because
[20:20.480 --> 20:25.360]  it comes in the fall. So all of a sudden you have these brand new flowers in the fall.
[20:25.360 --> 20:30.560]  The successional blooming of the flowers is the key. And the diversity of the flowers. So each,
[20:30.560 --> 20:36.400]  you know, insect that wants what it wants. Totally. Yeah. I've been growing a lot of calendula. Yeah.
[20:36.400 --> 20:41.120]  That's been receding a lot in borage too. Another one that I love on the farm that I used to,
[20:41.120 --> 20:45.920]  I actually hurt my back one year pulling it because I, it was, it frustrated me. So,
[20:45.920 --> 20:51.520]  and then I realized, no chicory. Chicory. Yeah. Chicory used to come up in my lawn and I hated
[20:51.520 --> 20:57.920]  it. And I was always trying to dig it out. And then I was looking for something like what blooms
[20:57.920 --> 21:03.760]  late in the year that you don't have to water, you know? And, and I realized chicory, the thing
[21:03.760 --> 21:07.840]  is that it blooms, it blooms every morning, you know, by the afternoon, if you're walking around,
[21:07.840 --> 21:12.800]  it doesn't look like anything special, but it blooms every morning and the wasps and the bees
[21:12.800 --> 21:18.880]  are like hovering. So now I went from being like on my most hated list to like, now it's one of
[21:18.880 --> 21:22.960]  the things I love the most. Oh, that's so funny. It's funny how that works. People, if they get
[21:22.960 --> 21:27.440]  more in tune with their environment, they'll see that things aren't weeds or bad things. They can
[21:27.440 --> 21:33.920]  have a lot of potential. Is there anywhere we can find your product that, you know? Yeah. So we
[21:33.920 --> 21:41.600]  have been working with a brand called Simple and they have created a little, I guess they're
[21:41.600 --> 21:48.160]  eights. I don't even know. And there is the Canada dog is one we grew last year and then
[21:48.160 --> 21:55.760]  Sapphire Sioux and the Cherry Lime dog. They have those at Urban Market. Urban Market. Oh, cool.
[21:55.760 --> 22:02.400]  Where's that? In Arcata. Oh, cool. Nice. All right. That's great. Local. The Sapphire Sioux, the CBD.
[22:02.400 --> 22:07.520]  And then I think they also have it at the High Times dispensaries down in the Bay Area. Oh, cool.
[22:08.480 --> 22:12.640]  Yeah. Awesome. We're really kind of waiting for the market to catch up to us.
[22:13.440 --> 22:23.520]  Until people can get that, what's the label that says I'm a mom and pop? What's the label
[22:23.520 --> 22:32.480]  that says it's grown in the earth? Once this whole thing gets sorted out, we'll be there.
[22:32.480 --> 22:42.240]  Okay. But right now we have a fund contract with 710 Labs and we had a really nice
[22:42.240 --> 22:46.320]  crop with them this year. And then we're sitting on a whole bunch of flower.
[22:48.080 --> 22:53.040]  But like, you know, you guys are diversified. Yeah. All in due time. Yeah. And it's also,
[22:53.040 --> 22:57.920]  it's like we said, like we're not desperate to get rid of it. And we also like aren't going to
[22:58.480 --> 23:03.680]  take a price that's insulting. And yeah, it's understandable. It's pretty gnarly right now.
[23:03.680 --> 23:07.920]  I'm glad we delayed because I see you might have other flower over there. I'd like to.
[23:07.920 --> 23:14.160]  Let's look at that. Yeah. So this one is strawberry cake and that is seed from Boonee Acres.
[23:14.160 --> 23:20.720]  Oh, nice. Boonee's got some good turf projects. Yeah. That was our highest THC one. Is Andrew
[23:20.720 --> 23:25.920]  the one doing all the breeding? Yeah, I think so. I think he's doing a lot of it. So we traded them
[23:26.880 --> 23:31.760]  for those seeds because they do the Korean natural farming. They make the ferments. So
[23:31.760 --> 23:36.640]  they took a whole bunch of rotten fruit. Oh, hilarious. They gave us seed in exchange for
[23:36.640 --> 23:41.840]  that. Oh my gosh. So that turned out really nice. Yeah, it's beautiful. It's like great structure,
[23:41.840 --> 23:50.480]  hard buds. Yeah. Smells delicious. Yeah. Oh, yeah. She makes me do a lot of the talking,
[23:50.480 --> 23:54.320]  but this is really her project. The strawberry cake project? Well, no, no,
[23:54.320 --> 23:57.440]  the whole cannabis project. Yeah. What other strains you got?
[23:58.960 --> 24:04.400]  Sherbert frosting is a happy, happy dream genetic. Happy dream, is it? Dan. Yeah.
[24:05.600 --> 24:11.760]  So that's that was fun one too. We never did that one before. Oh, wow. Yeah, it's nice. Yeah,
[24:11.760 --> 24:18.400]  that's pretty nice. I like the chirping performance. Smells delicious. Lovely,
[24:18.400 --> 24:23.920]  lovely. And the last one is a Bio Vortex genetic cherry lime dog that we've grown. Oh,
[24:23.920 --> 24:28.400]  very nice. Oh, nice. Finally, I get to smell it. I keep seeing it all over Instagram.
[24:33.760 --> 24:38.560]  And that's a beautiful one too. It's nice. It finishes early. And it's just once again,
[24:38.560 --> 24:42.320]  like the plant structure, like it's almost like you don't have to do anything to it.
[24:42.960 --> 24:47.680]  Just yeah, it grows. I mean, yeah, it just grows. Jesse's breeding like that. It's just
[24:47.680 --> 24:54.000]  designed for these systems. And just taking very little off the, you know, the branches
[24:54.000 --> 24:58.400]  when before you hang on, there's not a whole lot of water leaf. There's not a whole lot of leaf.
[24:59.200 --> 25:07.680]  It's dry, super nice. Amazing. That's great. Oh, it smells so good. Awesome. This is amazing.
[25:07.680 --> 25:13.760]  Guys. Crushed it. Well, thanks for your time. Yeah, it's been great. Thank you. Yeah, thank
[25:13.760 --> 25:15.200]  you guys. Have a good one. Yeah.
