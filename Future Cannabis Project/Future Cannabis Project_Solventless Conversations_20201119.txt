[00:00.830 --> 00:07.630]  All right, we are finally live. I politely waited for the coffee to end.
[00:07.630 --> 00:13.950]  Welcome everyone! Although we got one...
[00:17.150 --> 00:26.830]  All right, so take it away. Who's in the house tonight? How y'all doing? We were just
[00:27.150 --> 00:34.190]  pre-funking in the green room, so to speak. Tonight I brought you some really cool guests.
[00:35.150 --> 00:44.430]  My good friend Joseph is down here in this corner. That's good. Yes, representing for the California
[00:45.870 --> 00:51.070]  headman, like you know, folks that know what the real good good is. And he's going to talk to us
[00:51.070 --> 00:58.270]  tonight about Terps and, you know, the Hashi scene, what's going on in the international
[00:59.790 --> 01:04.990]  in the way of Terps and whatnot. And then our special guest tonight, our musical guest, is
[01:05.870 --> 01:12.270]  Mr. Josh Heinrichs coming at you from Missouri, Springfield, Missouri to be exact,
[01:12.910 --> 01:20.750]  and representing Ganja Records and, you know, spreading the word of love and family and herbs.
[01:20.750 --> 01:28.430]  So we got a good show for you guys tonight. That's what's up. Sounds dope. So I thought
[01:28.430 --> 01:36.430]  maybe we would kick off the vibes tonight with a little musical interlude. So without further ado,
[01:36.430 --> 01:44.910]  Mr. Josh, if you want to bless the people with some vibes. Yeah, should I leave the headphones
[01:44.910 --> 01:51.710]  in or out for that? I don't know how this... Strum the guitar and let me see how it sounds.
[01:52.750 --> 01:54.990]  That sounds pretty good. Okay.
[02:00.590 --> 02:04.510]  I just don't know how I sing kind of loud. So I guess we'll find out.
[02:04.510 --> 02:08.110]  Well,
[02:22.480 --> 02:30.320]  well it's been said over and over again that ganja never ever hurt no man. And it's been so
[02:30.880 --> 02:38.000]  time and time before that ganja really really is the cure. Oh for depression,
[02:38.000 --> 02:46.160]  God for cancer, for any kind of pain is the answer. Oh for love and peace,
[02:46.960 --> 02:54.720]  for every positive person to live in harmony with. I say love is the answer. And you know what?
[02:54.720 --> 03:03.200]  So ganja get rid of cancer. Love is the answer. And you know nothing's gonna stop us. I say love
[03:03.200 --> 03:15.120]  is the answer. I say, shalalala, shalalala, shalalala.
[03:15.440 --> 03:17.520]  Hey,
[03:17.520 --> 03:24.320]  check my seat. I'm gonna be on the left side, not right. Yo, I'm always looking towards the light.
[03:24.320 --> 03:31.120]  Girl, you bring positivity in my life. When I say enough people come around and try and give us
[03:31.120 --> 03:37.840]  truth. But I say ganja never ever hurt no one. And if you don't like it, you can just be passing on.
[03:38.480 --> 03:46.320]  Yo, cause I'm gonna be more than happy knowing that love is the answer and ganja's the key. And I say
[03:46.320 --> 03:53.120]  love is the answer. And you know what? Ganja get rid of cancer. Oh Lord, yeah.
[03:54.000 --> 03:59.760]  Love is the answer. And you know nothing's gonna stop us. I say love is the answer. I say,
[04:00.320 --> 04:14.080]  shalalala, shalalala, shalalala, shalalala.
[04:14.080 --> 04:19.440]  As the late great Jacob Miller would say, we just want to be free to be who we want to be, right?
[04:19.440 --> 04:25.280]  We're tired of hiding. Tired of hiding. That's right. So we say, hey,
[04:26.240 --> 04:37.080]  God, we want to go out in the open, where we can blow some
[04:37.080 --> 04:41.080]  We can blow it so far
[04:41.080 --> 04:44.080]  Say it feel like we in a bush
[04:44.080 --> 04:47.080]  Say it feel like pipe in a gully
[04:47.080 --> 04:51.080]  Cause we want to come out in the open
[04:51.080 --> 04:55.080]  We can blow it so far
[04:55.080 --> 04:59.800]  We can blow it so far
[04:59.800 --> 05:02.800]  Yeah, yeah, yeah
[05:02.800 --> 05:04.800]  Mm, mm, yeah
[05:04.800 --> 05:06.800]  Blow it so far away
[05:06.800 --> 05:10.800]  Oh yeah, love is the answer
[05:36.800 --> 05:38.800]  Ooh, I'm glad you guys liked it.
[05:38.800 --> 05:40.800]  Thanks for...
[05:40.800 --> 05:43.800]  Thanks man, thanks for having me on.
[05:43.800 --> 05:45.800]  You got music to buy, you got music to buy.
[05:45.800 --> 05:49.800]  Oh yeah, iTunes and all that stuff, Spotify.
[05:49.800 --> 05:51.800]  Masterself, hey.
[05:51.800 --> 05:53.800]  Yes sir, man.
[05:53.800 --> 05:56.800]  If you guys don't know who Josh Heinrichs is in,
[05:56.800 --> 05:59.800]  you guys are in for a treat tonight.
[05:59.800 --> 06:04.800]  He's really just masterful with the vibes, you know.
[06:04.800 --> 06:07.800]  And tonight I really kind of was hoping, you know,
[06:07.800 --> 06:11.800]  there's so much kind of strife going on around us.
[06:11.800 --> 06:13.800]  And if we realize that, you know,
[06:13.800 --> 06:15.800]  we're really in control of our destiny
[06:15.800 --> 06:16.800]  and the vibes that we're putting out
[06:16.800 --> 06:19.800]  or that we're taking in, you know,
[06:19.800 --> 06:21.800]  then we're ultimately stronger together.
[06:21.800 --> 06:25.800]  So Mr. Heinrichs is known for nothing but good vibes.
[06:25.800 --> 06:27.800]  So thank you for coming and hosting us tonight.
[06:27.800 --> 06:28.800]  Woo!
[06:28.800 --> 06:29.800]  Yeah, man.
[06:29.800 --> 06:31.800]  That's how we're gonna do it.
[06:31.800 --> 06:32.800]  Hell yeah.
[06:32.800 --> 06:34.800]  Whatever is on all them cable news stations,
[06:34.800 --> 06:35.800]  we're not tuning in.
[06:35.800 --> 06:39.800]  We're tuned in to this right now, right here, right now.
[06:39.800 --> 06:42.800]  No future, no past, only the present.
[06:42.800 --> 06:43.800]  Let's be-
[06:43.800 --> 06:44.800]  Public access, baby.
[06:44.800 --> 06:45.800]  Yes.
[06:47.800 --> 06:49.800]  Cannot stop the vibes.
[06:49.800 --> 06:51.800]  Can't stop the high beams.
[06:52.800 --> 06:53.800]  Nice.
[06:53.800 --> 06:58.800]  So, you know, Joseph and I spent a little bit of time
[06:58.800 --> 07:01.800]  together out in Barcelona, Spain.
[07:01.800 --> 07:03.800]  I didn't get out to this year,
[07:03.800 --> 07:05.800]  but it was the year before that.
[07:05.800 --> 07:08.800]  And he invited me out to some really cool
[07:08.800 --> 07:10.800]  underground hash clubs.
[07:10.800 --> 07:12.800]  And really, that's kind of the vibes over in Spain.
[07:12.800 --> 07:15.800]  If you don't know, nobody's got a neon sign out.
[07:15.800 --> 07:17.800]  You know, you're kind of walking in an alley
[07:17.800 --> 07:21.800]  and it's a nondescript door that you're gonna walk in.
[07:21.800 --> 07:24.800]  You know, maybe similar to this podcast,
[07:24.800 --> 07:27.800]  if you're not, you know, indoctrinated into the culture.
[07:27.800 --> 07:29.800]  So welcome in tonight.
[07:30.800 --> 07:33.800]  And some of those spots are a little shady to get into,
[07:33.800 --> 07:34.800]  but they're cool when you get inside.
[07:34.800 --> 07:35.800]  The vibe is nice.
[07:37.800 --> 07:40.800]  Joseph, tell us a little bit about International Hash
[07:40.800 --> 07:42.800]  and where you've been and what the world is like
[07:42.800 --> 07:44.800]  outside of the United States when we're talking hash.
[07:44.800 --> 07:46.800]  Yes, what's up?
[07:46.800 --> 07:50.800]  I met Kaia like 2015 when I moved back from Europe.
[07:50.800 --> 07:52.800]  I'm originally from California, Los Angeles,
[07:52.800 --> 07:55.800]  but I lived in the Bay Area for the last four years,
[07:55.800 --> 07:57.800]  going on five.
[07:58.800 --> 08:02.800]  My wife is a Londoner from England.
[08:02.800 --> 08:05.800]  So when we first got together, she was living in Vancouver.
[08:05.800 --> 08:11.800]  So, you know, you follow your heart sometimes
[08:11.800 --> 08:13.800]  and you fucking book a one-way ticket to Vancouver.
[08:13.800 --> 08:15.800]  And there you are in Vancouver,
[08:15.800 --> 08:16.800]  living with fucking your new girlfriend
[08:16.800 --> 08:19.800]  that you knew for a couple of years prior.
[08:19.800 --> 08:22.800]  And I remember meeting a bubble man up there
[08:22.800 --> 08:26.800]  at this thing they have every, on their Independence Day,
[08:26.800 --> 08:30.800]  they have a thing called Cannabis Day, or Canada Day.
[08:30.800 --> 08:33.800]  And like, man, being from where I'm from,
[08:33.800 --> 08:35.800]  like this shit blew my mind.
[08:35.800 --> 08:39.800]  And like Vancouver does it proper, yo.
[08:39.800 --> 08:42.800]  Like they shut down right out front of the badge
[08:42.800 --> 08:49.800]  of the Vancouver Art Gallery, I think that's what it's called.
[08:49.800 --> 08:50.800]  But they called it the badge.
[08:50.800 --> 08:54.800]  And they like, all these like tents pop up and shit.
[08:54.800 --> 08:59.800]  And, you know, I remember this was 2013.
[08:59.800 --> 09:02.800]  I remember I had never been to like a proper cannabis event
[09:02.800 --> 09:05.800]  besides like Smoke Out and shit like that.
[09:05.800 --> 09:08.800]  But that wasn't really too cannabis oriented,
[09:08.800 --> 09:12.800]  more focused on the music aspects.
[09:12.800 --> 09:14.800]  So yeah, I was up there for a while.
[09:14.800 --> 09:16.800]  You know, it was wild, yo,
[09:16.800 --> 09:18.800]  because like in Canada, you can get like weed
[09:18.800 --> 09:21.800]  for like half the price I was getting in LA.
[09:21.800 --> 09:23.800]  So actually it was like heaven to me.
[09:23.800 --> 09:25.800]  And I was getting fire ass weed.
[09:25.800 --> 09:27.800]  And I had this plug named Jack,
[09:27.800 --> 09:29.800]  and it was like a ginger dude, I called him Ginger Jack.
[09:29.800 --> 09:31.800]  And that fool was like the illest plug
[09:31.800 --> 09:33.800]  I've ever had in my life, yo.
[09:33.800 --> 09:36.800]  Like every time he said he was going to be somewhere
[09:36.800 --> 09:38.800]  at a certain time, that dude was there at that time, yo.
[09:38.800 --> 09:41.800]  Like never in all my days did that shit happen.
[09:41.800 --> 09:44.800]  But yeah, after that, you know, we moved back to LA
[09:44.800 --> 09:46.800]  because wifey had never lived in LA.
[09:46.800 --> 09:48.800]  And then after that, you know, she was like,
[09:48.800 --> 09:50.800]  well, let's go, let's move to London.
[09:50.800 --> 09:52.800]  And I was like, let's do that.
[09:52.800 --> 09:54.800]  Yeah, let's do that.
[09:54.800 --> 09:58.800]  And we moved to London and, you know,
[09:58.800 --> 10:01.800]  I feel like California is like pretty Mecca-ish
[10:01.800 --> 10:03.800]  when it comes to cannabis, you know.
[10:03.800 --> 10:07.800]  I didn't really know this until I moved away from California
[10:07.800 --> 10:10.800]  and UK was the first place where people started
[10:10.800 --> 10:13.800]  treating me differently because I was from California
[10:13.800 --> 10:14.800]  and it was wild.
[10:14.800 --> 10:16.800]  And I started meeting people that are like
[10:16.800 --> 10:18.800]  people you wouldn't like befriend normally.
[10:18.800 --> 10:21.800]  Like, I don't know if you guys are familiar with Team 10.
[10:22.800 --> 10:24.800]  Out of the UK, he now lives in LA,
[10:24.800 --> 10:26.800]  but he was one of the dudes I met
[10:26.800 --> 10:29.800]  and like he was a big player in London at the time.
[10:29.800 --> 10:32.800]  And I just started to meet people just again,
[10:32.800 --> 10:34.800]  being from where I was from, it was really wild.
[10:34.800 --> 10:37.800]  I never really had experienced that before,
[10:37.800 --> 10:41.800]  but these Londoners knew what's up with like fire weed.
[10:41.800 --> 10:45.800]  And, you know, they do a lot of like importing
[10:45.800 --> 10:46.800]  and shit over there.
[10:46.800 --> 10:50.800]  So like crazy amounts for like pounds of weed
[10:50.800 --> 10:51.800]  goes over there.
[10:51.800 --> 10:56.800]  So through living in London, I was getting robbed,
[10:56.800 --> 11:00.800]  like buying like really shitty ass weed
[11:00.800 --> 11:03.800]  that was like a four out of 10
[11:03.800 --> 11:05.800]  and had like spider mites on it.
[11:05.800 --> 11:08.800]  It was really bad, yo, cause I didn't know anybody.
[11:08.800 --> 11:10.800]  And being from where I'm from,
[11:10.800 --> 11:14.800]  it was kush all day, every day, OG all day, every day,
[11:14.800 --> 11:18.800]  breakfast, the morning, lunch, dinner, dessert type shit.
[11:18.800 --> 11:20.800]  But moving to London, they don't really parlay like that.
[11:20.800 --> 11:22.800]  Cause you know, to my naivete,
[11:22.800 --> 11:25.800]  like they just meet me ignorant as fuck.
[11:25.800 --> 11:26.800]  You know what I'm saying?
[11:26.800 --> 11:29.800]  Like expecting kush and OG to grow everywhere.
[11:29.800 --> 11:31.800]  In England, it just doesn't crack there
[11:31.800 --> 11:33.800]  because they have huge precipitation shit
[11:33.800 --> 11:36.800]  and mold is profuse there.
[11:36.800 --> 11:38.800]  And, oh, geez, you ain't growing that shit.
[11:38.800 --> 11:41.800]  So it's haze and lemon and cheese all day.
[11:41.800 --> 11:44.800]  And I just wasn't used to that shit, man.
[11:44.800 --> 11:47.800]  And, you know, then it was like, wifey was like,
[11:47.800 --> 11:49.800]  well, then where do you want to go in Europe?
[11:49.800 --> 11:51.800]  And, you know, where did I want to go?
[11:51.800 --> 11:52.800]  You know what I'm saying?
[11:52.800 --> 11:55.800]  Amsterdam, first place, like let's go.
[11:55.800 --> 11:57.800]  You know what I'm saying?
[11:57.800 --> 11:59.800]  I'm trying to speed her off real quick.
[11:59.800 --> 12:01.800]  So we go to Amsterdam.
[12:01.800 --> 12:03.800]  You know, I'm not really knowing too much now.
[12:03.800 --> 12:07.800]  I'm really naive again, you know, now it's 2014.
[12:07.800 --> 12:10.800]  Amsterdam has changed drastically from the 1990s
[12:10.800 --> 12:13.800]  that I remember it to be like the golden years and shit.
[12:14.800 --> 12:16.800]  I look young, but I'm 40.
[12:16.800 --> 12:17.800]  You know what I'm saying?
[12:17.800 --> 12:21.800]  So now it's 2014 and I'm there now.
[12:21.800 --> 12:23.800]  I'm like, it's haze everywhere still.
[12:23.800 --> 12:25.800]  And I'm just like, I'm trying to find OG,
[12:25.800 --> 12:27.800]  trying to find OG, it's like nowhere, yo.
[12:27.800 --> 12:29.800]  And I'm like, you know, luckily they had
[12:29.800 --> 12:31.800]  like legal mushrooms in Amsterdam.
[12:31.800 --> 12:33.800]  They have like legal truffle shops.
[12:33.800 --> 12:35.800]  So you can go buy like legal truffles.
[12:35.800 --> 12:37.800]  And me and wifey ate like 10 grams each
[12:37.800 --> 12:40.800]  and we fucking went to another place and shit.
[12:40.800 --> 12:41.800]  We were like not there.
[12:41.800 --> 12:42.800]  You know what I'm saying?
[12:43.800 --> 12:45.800]  So that saved like the trip.
[12:45.800 --> 12:47.800]  So I get back to London and all my homies like,
[12:47.800 --> 12:50.800]  bro, you need to go to Barcelona, bro.
[12:50.800 --> 12:52.800]  Barcelona is the spot.
[12:52.800 --> 12:54.800]  And I'm like, fuck, that's right.
[12:54.800 --> 12:56.800]  Spanning this just happened 2013.
[12:56.800 --> 12:59.800]  It was now, this was now,
[13:00.800 --> 13:03.800]  this was, we went to Amsterdam in April
[13:03.800 --> 13:06.800]  for our anniversary, April 1st and shit.
[13:06.800 --> 13:08.800]  So I know it was right after that.
[13:08.800 --> 13:09.800]  But then my homies in Berlin,
[13:09.800 --> 13:12.800]  so I used to make rap music, hip hop back in the day.
[13:12.800 --> 13:15.800]  And the only shit that I have on vinyl,
[13:15.800 --> 13:19.800]  like actual vinyl, I made with my homie from Berlin.
[13:19.800 --> 13:20.800]  So my homies from Berlin are like,
[13:20.800 --> 13:22.800]  yo, you need to come to Berlin, bro.
[13:22.800 --> 13:23.800]  We got fire ass weed in Berlin.
[13:23.800 --> 13:26.800]  And I'm like, well, I'm going to be going to Barcelona anyway.
[13:26.800 --> 13:28.800]  So let's go to Bar, let's go to Berlin.
[13:28.800 --> 13:30.800]  That shit was mad poppin'.
[13:30.800 --> 13:32.800]  Berlin was like just the whole experience.
[13:32.800 --> 13:36.800]  I don't really drink alcohol like that.
[13:36.800 --> 13:37.800]  You know what I'm saying?
[13:37.800 --> 13:39.800]  But like my homies took me to a bar and like,
[13:39.800 --> 13:41.800]  you know, I'm not going to turn down the fucking beer
[13:41.800 --> 13:43.800]  from the homie in Berlin and shit, you know?
[13:45.800 --> 13:47.800]  So we're at this bar and shit,
[13:47.800 --> 13:49.800]  just to segue real quick into Berlin story.
[13:49.800 --> 13:50.800]  We're at this bar and shit,
[13:50.800 --> 13:51.800]  this shit boogied on my brain.
[13:51.800 --> 13:54.800]  So we're at this bar and we're just chatting it up.
[13:54.800 --> 13:57.800]  So again, I made music with this dude 10 years prior and shit.
[13:57.800 --> 14:00.800]  So we had a lot to catch up on.
[14:00.800 --> 14:01.800]  And now I'm looking at the clock
[14:01.800 --> 14:02.800]  and it was like five in the morning and shit.
[14:02.800 --> 14:04.800]  And I'm looking at, there's a bartender
[14:04.800 --> 14:06.800]  and he's just chilling with one dude.
[14:06.800 --> 14:08.800]  And I'm like, bro, what time is this place closed?
[14:08.800 --> 14:11.800]  And they were like, yo, it closes whenever we leave and shit.
[14:11.800 --> 14:14.800]  And I was like, whoa, that's, I was like,
[14:14.800 --> 14:17.800]  man, I thought now I'm all American feeling guilty and shit.
[14:17.800 --> 14:18.800]  But damn, these dudes are like, it's five in the morning.
[14:18.800 --> 14:20.800]  These dudes are just waiting for us to leave and shit.
[14:20.800 --> 14:22.800]  And he's like, nah, it's not even like that.
[14:22.800 --> 14:23.800]  Like it's golden, bro.
[14:23.800 --> 14:25.800]  We leave whenever we want and it's cool.
[14:25.800 --> 14:27.800]  And I was like, so we ended up jamming and shit.
[14:27.800 --> 14:28.800]  Berlin was poppin'.
[14:28.800 --> 14:31.800]  But I get back to London, we go to Barcelona.
[14:31.800 --> 14:34.800]  Now I prefended Bubble Man at this time and shit
[14:34.800 --> 14:38.800]  because before the whole hash church things,
[14:38.800 --> 14:41.800]  he was doing these like Google Hangouts
[14:41.800 --> 14:44.800]  and it would be like 10 people in the spot.
[14:46.800 --> 14:47.800]  And I'd be one of those dudes, I just drop in and shit.
[14:47.800 --> 14:48.800]  Cause I was living in London
[14:48.800 --> 14:50.800]  and I had fuck all to do and shit, you know what I'm saying?
[14:50.800 --> 14:53.800]  So, and I was eight hours ahead.
[14:53.800 --> 14:55.800]  So he'd be doing this shit like at noon
[14:55.800 --> 14:57.800]  and it'd be 8 p.m. my time and shit.
[14:57.800 --> 14:59.800]  So I would pop in and he always wall out
[14:59.800 --> 15:02.800]  because I was from LA, but I was living in London and shit.
[15:02.800 --> 15:03.800]  And he'd be like, bro, what the fuck?
[15:03.800 --> 15:05.800]  And I was like, you know, wifey and all this.
[15:05.800 --> 15:08.800]  And so I was telling him I'm gonna go to Barcelona
[15:08.800 --> 15:11.800]  and he's like, bro, you need to hit up HQ
[15:11.800 --> 15:15.800]  and David and fucking Edu and fucking,
[15:15.800 --> 15:17.800]  and tell him that I got your back.
[15:17.800 --> 15:19.800]  And I was like, and like Kaya said earlier,
[15:19.800 --> 15:20.800]  like there's no signage and shit.
[15:20.800 --> 15:22.800]  You really need to have the in
[15:22.800 --> 15:25.800]  and Bubble Man being the in was huge for me.
[15:25.800 --> 15:26.800]  You know what I'm saying?
[15:28.800 --> 15:30.800]  So we ended up booking tickets going to Barca.
[15:30.800 --> 15:34.800]  But now it's like maybe June, July.
[15:34.800 --> 15:35.800]  So it's summertime.
[15:35.800 --> 15:38.800]  So, you know, I was getting pretty,
[15:38.800 --> 15:41.800]  it's getting pretty depressive and fucking London and shit.
[15:41.800 --> 15:42.800]  Cause it's like upside down world
[15:42.800 --> 15:44.800]  for a fucking Angeleno like myself and shit.
[15:44.800 --> 15:48.800]  So that I was sitting on with a sad lamp
[15:48.800 --> 15:50.800]  and fucking taking vitamin D supplements and shit
[15:50.800 --> 15:52.800]  and mad depressed.
[15:52.800 --> 15:53.800]  And it wasn't even winter yet.
[15:53.800 --> 15:54.800]  You know what I'm saying?
[15:54.800 --> 15:55.800]  That was spring.
[15:55.800 --> 15:59.800]  So we finally get to Barcelona
[15:59.800 --> 16:00.800]  and it's vibes, man.
[16:00.800 --> 16:04.800]  Like I just had an emotional,
[16:04.800 --> 16:06.800]  huge emotional attachment to that place.
[16:06.800 --> 16:10.800]  Like me being Mexican, my last name Spanish.
[16:10.800 --> 16:13.800]  Yeah, I got blood type shit.
[16:13.800 --> 16:18.800]  So it was, I don't really know how to explain it.
[16:18.800 --> 16:22.800]  It was kind of an aha moment for me, maybe.
[16:22.800 --> 16:25.800]  Like I just, I don't know.
[16:25.800 --> 16:27.800]  Everyone was speaking Spanish and shit.
[16:27.800 --> 16:28.800]  You know, it just seemed very homey.
[16:28.800 --> 16:31.800]  The same sun in Barcelona is the same sun in LA.
[16:31.800 --> 16:32.800]  It's wild.
[16:32.800 --> 16:34.800]  I don't know how to explain it, but it is.
[16:34.800 --> 16:37.800]  And we were just on the beach
[16:37.800 --> 16:42.800]  and they got like topless beaches and shit.
[16:42.800 --> 16:44.800]  So that shit was just a wild experience.
[16:44.800 --> 16:46.800]  First experiences with that shit.
[16:46.800 --> 16:48.800]  And they're just so free with it.
[16:48.800 --> 16:50.800]  Like the men friends come up to each other
[16:50.800 --> 16:52.800]  and like greet each other with like kisses and shit.
[16:52.800 --> 16:55.800]  Like they're just very like, it was just weird.
[16:55.800 --> 16:57.800]  It was just not weird.
[16:57.800 --> 16:58.800]  It was a beautiful thing.
[16:58.800 --> 17:01.800]  It was like something I had never experienced.
[17:01.800 --> 17:06.800]  I remember going to this one food place with wifey and shit.
[17:06.800 --> 17:08.800]  And like, we, it just seemed really like we were
[17:08.800 --> 17:11.800]  like stuck out like a sore thumb type shit.
[17:11.800 --> 17:13.800]  And like, it was just the local peoples
[17:13.800 --> 17:17.800]  and we ended up ordering all this like beautiful ass food.
[17:17.800 --> 17:20.800]  And there was this old couple next to us and shit.
[17:20.800 --> 17:22.800]  And like, they were like my parents age
[17:22.800 --> 17:24.800]  and they got up from their lunch
[17:24.800 --> 17:26.800]  and they just said like goodbye in Spanish.
[17:26.800 --> 17:28.800]  And like literally have a good day.
[17:28.800 --> 17:30.800]  And I like broke down and shit.
[17:30.800 --> 17:31.800]  I'm like had a moment.
[17:31.800 --> 17:34.800]  I ended up going outside and like, yo this shit's wild.
[17:34.800 --> 17:37.800]  Like this shit, it was just an amazing place.
[17:37.800 --> 17:41.800]  And then these clubs, yo, I remember going to HQ and shit
[17:41.800 --> 17:43.800]  and like these doors opened and it was really like sick.
[17:43.800 --> 17:45.800]  It was like magical, yo, on some real shit.
[17:45.800 --> 17:46.800]  You know, we come from California.
[17:46.800 --> 17:48.800]  We got the dispensary shit a lot.
[17:48.800 --> 17:50.800]  That wasn't a new thing for me.
[17:50.800 --> 17:53.800]  But these fucking clubs was something different, yo.
[17:54.800 --> 17:56.800]  Like, you know, the dude's Russian and shit.
[17:56.800 --> 17:57.800]  David is Russian.
[17:57.800 --> 18:00.800]  So he had the Russian pool tables chilling.
[18:00.800 --> 18:02.800]  You know, you walk down the stairs.
[18:02.800 --> 18:04.800]  There's like a bar right there by the pool tables.
[18:04.800 --> 18:06.800]  You walk down and there's like a,
[18:06.800 --> 18:09.800]  they have the dispensary right there where you buy the weed.
[18:09.800 --> 18:13.800]  They had like purple cush and like San Fernando Valley OG.
[18:13.800 --> 18:14.800]  And I cried, yo.
[18:14.800 --> 18:15.800]  Like when I smoked that shit, I cried.
[18:15.800 --> 18:19.800]  Cause I hadn't had OG in like months.
[18:19.800 --> 18:23.800]  And it was just like a fucking like homely feeling and shit.
[18:23.800 --> 18:26.800]  Then this beautiful Spanish woman comes up to me and she's like,
[18:26.800 --> 18:28.800]  would you like some fresh juice?
[18:28.800 --> 18:30.800]  And she like names like a dozen fruits.
[18:30.800 --> 18:32.800]  And I'm like, what?
[18:32.800 --> 18:35.800]  I was like, I can have like an orange Kiwi juice.
[18:35.800 --> 18:36.800]  And she was like, yeah.
[18:36.800 --> 18:38.800]  And I was like, well, then I want that.
[18:38.800 --> 18:39.800]  And she said, I want that.
[18:39.800 --> 18:40.800]  Yeah.
[18:40.800 --> 18:44.800]  Cause in Amsterdam, they have this bottled juice that you can buy
[18:44.800 --> 18:48.800]  at the supermarket that was like cold pressed Kiwi orange juice.
[18:48.800 --> 18:51.800]  And it was the most delicious shit I had ever had in my life.
[18:51.800 --> 18:54.800]  To this day, I have reveries about the juice in Amsterdam.
[18:54.800 --> 18:57.800]  Like if and when I go back, I'm going straight to the juice,
[18:57.800 --> 18:58.800]  like straight up.
[18:58.800 --> 19:01.800]  Like, so, so, and, and, and so she brings back this juice.
[19:01.800 --> 19:03.800]  It was fire.
[19:03.800 --> 19:06.800]  Edu from Blue Ice Tech was doing the washing at the time,
[19:06.800 --> 19:08.800]  the homie Edu.
[19:08.800 --> 19:11.800]  And he had the Shishkeberry 73 and 90U.
[19:11.800 --> 19:14.800]  And there I'm just like, Shishkeberry was,
[19:14.800 --> 19:17.800]  it's just a very peculiar turf.
[19:17.800 --> 19:19.800]  I don't know if you guys are familiar with it.
[19:19.800 --> 19:24.800]  It's just, it's very special by itself.
[19:24.800 --> 19:27.800]  It's just, you know, the barb is, is Afghan Shishkeberry.
[19:27.800 --> 19:31.800]  I have Breeder Steve's voice in my head right now.
[19:31.800 --> 19:33.800]  The great white shark.
[19:33.800 --> 19:34.800]  I have some beans of those.
[19:34.800 --> 19:36.800]  So yeah.
[19:36.800 --> 19:39.800]  And then it was just, you know, Spain was just dope.
[19:39.800 --> 19:42.800]  So, so now it was me going back to London and,
[19:42.800 --> 19:44.800]  and knowing that I need to go back to Spain.
[19:44.800 --> 19:47.800]  Spain's the place I need to like, keep going back.
[19:47.800 --> 19:49.800]  Like, there's no need to keep traveling.
[19:49.800 --> 19:51.800]  These are the places that I'm trying to find, like,
[19:51.800 --> 19:54.800]  shit that I can like, that be sufficient.
[19:54.800 --> 19:55.800]  You know what I'm saying?
[19:55.800 --> 19:58.800]  For myself and, and, and while I'm out here.
[19:58.800 --> 20:01.800]  So, you know, we kept going back to Spain.
[20:01.800 --> 20:02.800]  Went to like Ibiza.
[20:02.800 --> 20:05.800]  You know, the people that I met in fucking England was again,
[20:05.800 --> 20:06.800]  like I was saying,
[20:06.800 --> 20:09.800]  I was just meeting these people that a normal person wouldn't be
[20:09.800 --> 20:10.800]  able to meet these people.
[20:10.800 --> 20:12.800]  And I don't really know how I met these people.
[20:12.800 --> 20:14.800]  Probably the same way I met Kaya, to be honest.
[20:14.800 --> 20:17.800]  Same way I got friends that all my homies make hash.
[20:17.800 --> 20:19.800]  You know what I'm saying?
[20:19.800 --> 20:21.800]  The circle that I have is a very tight circle.
[20:21.800 --> 20:26.800]  I don't really know, but, but we ended up fucking going to Ibiza.
[20:26.800 --> 20:29.800]  Cause the homies like, yo, they got this bomb club in Ibiza.
[20:29.800 --> 20:30.800]  So we go there.
[20:30.800 --> 20:32.800]  That was really popping.
[20:32.800 --> 20:33.800]  That was probably the dopest,
[20:33.800 --> 20:35.800]  one of the dopest places I've ever been.
[20:35.800 --> 20:40.800]  And so I remember I'm leaving London to go to Spain.
[20:42.800 --> 20:46.800]  This was 2015 now I'm leaving cause the country doesn't want my ass and
[20:46.800 --> 20:48.800]  my Mexican ass in there anymore.
[20:48.800 --> 20:49.800]  So they're trying to get me the fuck out.
[20:49.800 --> 20:55.800]  So now I'm like, all right, let's go to Spain one last time.
[20:55.800 --> 20:58.800]  Before I moved back to the States and shit.
[20:58.800 --> 21:05.800]  So we fly into Madrid because I found out that my namesake Ocana,
[21:05.800 --> 21:07.800]  it's a very like rare Spanish Mexican name and shit.
[21:07.800 --> 21:09.800]  And it's this little ass town in Spain,
[21:09.800 --> 21:12.800]  like a fucking hole in the wall that I probably should have never gone to,
[21:12.800 --> 21:15.800]  but wifey was down. So I was like, yo, let's go.
[21:15.800 --> 21:18.800]  We should have went to Toledo cause that was where all dope shit was.
[21:18.800 --> 21:21.800]  But I was like, yo, my ego and pride was like, no,
[21:21.800 --> 21:23.800]  let's go to fucking Ocana and shit.
[21:23.800 --> 21:25.800]  So I can see my name all over the place and shit all randomly.
[21:25.800 --> 21:27.800]  But so I went there, we did that.
[21:27.800 --> 21:31.800]  We, we, so I flew to Madrid and again,
[21:31.800 --> 21:34.800]  my homie who linked me in fucking Ibiza was the same dude who linked me with
[21:34.800 --> 21:36.800]  some dude in fucking Madrid.
[21:37.800 --> 21:41.800]  And the dude I met in Madrid was like the dude, like he was like,
[21:41.800 --> 21:43.800]  like he was the dude and shit.
[21:43.800 --> 21:47.800]  And so he's taking me to these clubs the first nights of,
[21:47.800 --> 21:49.800]  cause I fly in by myself cause wifey still had to work.
[21:49.800 --> 21:54.800]  So I flew in like on a Wednesday or Thursday and she worked till Friday,
[21:54.800 --> 21:57.800]  flew out Friday. So I went out by myself.
[21:57.800 --> 22:01.800]  So I'm at these clubs and there was like three of them and shit.
[22:01.800 --> 22:05.800]  And so the next day I'm by myself and I know I can go back to these clubs
[22:05.800 --> 22:06.800]  because I have a membership and shit.
[22:06.800 --> 22:08.800]  Cause you have to like sign papers, they like take your picture.
[22:08.800 --> 22:13.800]  Sometimes they give you their credit card or some type of key chain so you can
[22:13.800 --> 22:20.800]  have like an account on them so they can,
[22:20.800 --> 22:22.800]  but you can keep it or whatever.
[22:22.800 --> 22:29.800]  And so now I'm going to this club and I'm there by myself and like some
[22:29.800 --> 22:31.800]  random dude comes and he's like Joseph.
[22:31.800 --> 22:36.800]  And it was some kid I met the day prior and he's with some random dude.
[22:36.800 --> 22:42.800]  And he's like, Hey Joseph, this is my friend, Nicholas.
[22:42.800 --> 22:44.800]  And he was like, Oh, it was like, Nicholas is my friend Joseph.
[22:44.800 --> 22:47.800]  He's from LA and this dude just eyes get all big and shit.
[22:47.800 --> 22:50.800]  He's like, you're from LA bro. And I was like, yeah, bro. Yeah.
[22:50.800 --> 22:54.800]  He's like, immediately he's like, bro, can I take you?
[22:54.800 --> 22:58.800]  And I don't know if you got a girl, but if I can take you and your girl,
[22:59.800 --> 23:03.800]  My brother, we can have like a business meeting.
[23:03.800 --> 23:04.800]  Like what?
[23:04.800 --> 23:08.800]  Like, Hey bro, if you want to take me to go get some sushi, bro.
[23:08.800 --> 23:11.800]  In your hood I'm down, bro.
[23:11.800 --> 23:12.800]  Are you paying?
[23:12.800 --> 23:14.800]  Cool. Then yeah, we go, we go then bro. Yeah.
[23:14.800 --> 23:15.800]  Let's do that.
[23:15.800 --> 23:20.800]  So that Monday comes, picks me and my wife up with his brother.
[23:20.800 --> 23:21.800]  We go to this sushi spot,
[23:21.800 --> 23:25.800]  his brother starts cheating the pens like in the spot and I'm like, well,
[23:25.800 --> 23:26.800]  I got my pants on.
[23:26.800 --> 23:29.040]  So I'm like, I'm gonna smoke hash in here.
[23:29.040 --> 23:30.360]  That's what's up.
[23:30.360 --> 23:31.720]  So we just chief and he's like,
[23:31.720 --> 23:34.760]  hey bro, I got this clothing company
[23:34.760 --> 23:37.300]  and like we would love for it to be in the States.
[23:37.300 --> 23:39.960]  And it's something that I don't wanna really get into it,
[23:39.960 --> 23:41.320]  who they are, whatever,
[23:41.320 --> 23:43.380]  cause I don't really have good relations
[23:43.380 --> 23:44.980]  with these people anymore.
[23:44.980 --> 23:46.800]  But it has Madrid in it.
[23:46.800 --> 23:48.920]  And I was like, bro, I don't,
[23:48.920 --> 23:49.840]  and I just told him straight up.
[23:49.840 --> 23:51.840]  I was like, yeah, bro, like honestly,
[23:51.840 --> 23:53.280]  we don't really give a shit about anything
[23:53.280 --> 23:54.880]  that says Madrid on it, bro.
[23:54.880 --> 23:58.760]  Like maybe Paris, maybe London,
[23:58.760 --> 24:00.600]  but even then bro, like that's still like,
[24:00.600 --> 24:01.640]  nah, it ain't cracking bro.
[24:01.640 --> 24:03.180]  I don't really think that's popping.
[24:03.180 --> 24:06.520]  And they go like ghost, like dreams crushed type shit.
[24:06.520 --> 24:07.360]  You know what I'm saying?
[24:07.360 --> 24:08.340]  They're young kids.
[24:09.840 --> 24:11.920]  I'm like, yo, but I've been traveling around Spain bro.
[24:11.920 --> 24:15.840]  And like, let fuck, we could like do,
[24:15.840 --> 24:17.640]  let's do it like a cannabis club in Spain,
[24:17.640 --> 24:18.960]  like all California Steve's.
[24:18.960 --> 24:19.800]  You know what I'm saying?
[24:19.800 --> 24:22.720]  And we'll just, we'll like crush it out here bro.
[24:22.720 --> 24:25.400]  And these kids eyes get all big.
[24:25.400 --> 24:27.360]  And I must've been talking to the right people
[24:27.360 --> 24:30.600]  because then I go home and like three months later,
[24:30.600 --> 24:32.680]  we got a fucking club opening Madrid and shit
[24:32.680 --> 24:34.040]  called Reserva Privada.
[24:36.240 --> 24:39.160]  And, you know, I tried to like do this.
[24:39.160 --> 24:41.320]  I tried, you know, all my homies ended up doing it
[24:41.320 --> 24:43.960]  the right way, but I was the first one to do it.
[24:43.960 --> 24:45.640]  And like, we didn't do it the right way.
[24:45.640 --> 24:49.380]  And it's unfortunate, but it wasn't on me.
[24:49.380 --> 24:52.280]  Like I, they were younger, you know,
[24:52.920 --> 24:56.280]  I was older, so I should have probably taken more control,
[24:56.280 --> 24:59.920]  but this was their city and like they grew up in the city.
[24:59.920 --> 25:02.520]  So I depended highly on this shit.
[25:02.520 --> 25:04.560]  Well, I ended up getting my life threatened.
[25:06.240 --> 25:07.800]  It was bad bros.
[25:07.800 --> 25:10.000]  It was not good at all.
[25:10.000 --> 25:15.000]  I ended up lasting like 18 weeks or some shit like that.
[25:16.120 --> 25:20.320]  And I had, I just, everything that I was trying to like do
[25:20.320 --> 25:21.560]  just wasn't cracking and shit.
[25:21.880 --> 25:25.200]  I tried to have like the first non-tobacco club in Spain.
[25:25.200 --> 25:27.360]  That shit wasn't happening because it was in Madrid.
[25:27.360 --> 25:28.680]  And then they lied to me telling me
[25:28.680 --> 25:30.320]  we couldn't get it in Barcelona
[25:30.320 --> 25:33.520]  because the licenses had been all taken up.
[25:33.520 --> 25:35.640]  And then like not even two months later,
[25:35.640 --> 25:38.040]  my homies team 10 and them open up the plug.
[25:38.040 --> 25:40.840]  And I'm just like, all these hoes were just gassing me
[25:40.840 --> 25:41.920]  because they had grown up in Madrid
[25:41.920 --> 25:43.760]  and they didn't want to leave their hometown.
[25:43.760 --> 25:45.080]  You know what I'm saying?
[25:45.080 --> 25:49.920]  And I ended up flying home with my tail to my legs,
[25:49.960 --> 25:52.200]  but inspired and fucking like,
[25:52.200 --> 25:54.200]  hey, no one can take that shit away from me type shit.
[25:54.200 --> 25:55.040]  You know what I'm saying?
[25:55.040 --> 25:56.240]  Like I did that type thing.
[25:57.360 --> 25:59.440]  And my dad had just got cancer and shit.
[25:59.440 --> 26:02.060]  So it was just one of those things.
[26:03.960 --> 26:07.600]  I flew back and then Tony Brasero moved to California.
[26:07.600 --> 26:08.680]  And then Bubble Man was like,
[26:08.680 --> 26:11.160]  yo, Tony's about to start up my Bubble Man brand, bro.
[26:11.160 --> 26:13.160]  You want to be a sales rep?
[26:13.160 --> 26:15.640]  And I'm like, yeah, bro.
[26:15.640 --> 26:18.000]  Yeah, yeah, that's what's up.
[26:18.000 --> 26:18.840]  Let's do that.
[26:18.840 --> 26:21.120]  And then my wifey fucking ends up moving from London
[26:21.120 --> 26:24.720]  and we ended up moving to the Bay for like nothing and shit.
[26:24.720 --> 26:26.480]  I don't want to like say anything negative
[26:26.480 --> 26:28.960]  because Tony's a G, you know what I'm saying?
[26:30.080 --> 26:33.480]  It just didn't work out and fucking unfortunately.
[26:35.280 --> 26:38.880]  And I stayed in the Bay and I've been up here since.
[26:38.880 --> 26:40.800]  And that's pretty much it, bro, in a nutshell.
[26:40.800 --> 26:44.240]  Yeah, fucking Europe's popping, Spain, Barcelona.
[26:44.240 --> 26:45.820]  We met Kai a couple of years back.
[26:45.820 --> 26:48.600]  We were there and every time before,
[26:49.360 --> 26:50.920]  when I came back, when I moved back to the States,
[26:50.920 --> 26:51.960]  I moved back to California.
[26:51.960 --> 26:53.600]  Now I'm trying to smoke all the fire shit
[26:53.600 --> 26:55.880]  that I've missed out on because the year I was gone
[26:55.880 --> 26:59.400]  in Europe, the only fucking time I'm gone,
[26:59.400 --> 27:01.280]  it happens to be like the best fucking year
[27:01.280 --> 27:05.680]  of like Hettie Glass, all the hash started coming.
[27:05.680 --> 27:08.120]  It was just like, what's good, my son?
[27:08.120 --> 27:09.200]  It was good, brother.
[27:09.200 --> 27:10.960]  Yeah, so I missed it.
[27:10.960 --> 27:11.800]  So I get back.
[27:11.800 --> 27:15.320]  So now I'm that dude paying $200 for a gram
[27:15.320 --> 27:18.320]  of Cuban fucking dry sniff in LA and shit.
[27:19.040 --> 27:20.320]  And I'm getting like four grams
[27:20.320 --> 27:22.880]  and then I'm being stupid, like telling my girlfriend,
[27:22.880 --> 27:26.000]  she's like, wait, you just paid $800 for four grams
[27:26.000 --> 27:27.400]  of dry sniff and I'm just like, oh yeah,
[27:27.400 --> 27:28.760]  probably shouldn't have said that to you.
[27:28.760 --> 27:30.760]  I should have probably been one that I kept,
[27:30.760 --> 27:33.120]  kept that one to myself and shit.
[27:33.120 --> 27:35.480]  But I built a rapport with Cuban and like,
[27:35.480 --> 27:36.320]  you know what I'm saying?
[27:36.320 --> 27:38.080]  So it is what it is, you know what I'm saying?
[27:38.080 --> 27:39.040]  But I was that dude.
[27:39.040 --> 27:42.520]  So when I met Kai, I knew he was making hash.
[27:42.520 --> 27:44.920]  So when I saw him at some random cup,
[27:44.920 --> 27:46.880]  whether I think it was either Chalice
[27:46.880 --> 27:50.360]  or it was Emerald Cup, most likely,
[27:50.360 --> 27:51.960]  I'm thinking it was Emerald Cup.
[27:53.440 --> 27:54.480]  And he had that coffee.
[27:54.480 --> 27:55.840]  And someone was just telling me right before
[27:55.840 --> 27:56.920]  I entered the room, he was like,
[27:56.920 --> 27:58.320]  bro, I missed that coffee melt.
[27:58.320 --> 28:02.840]  And I'm like, bro, for real, I miss that shit so much.
[28:02.840 --> 28:04.720]  What's up with that coffee melt, bro?
[28:14.770 --> 28:16.690]  Kai, you gotta unmute yourself.
[28:19.250 --> 28:20.730]  I can't hear anything you guys are saying
[28:20.730 --> 28:22.030]  if you're saying anything.
[28:23.030 --> 28:25.110]  We've been talking the whole time.
[28:26.950 --> 28:29.030]  You're actually muted the whole time.
[28:34.190 --> 28:36.710]  Kai, you gotta unmute yourself, Kai.
[28:38.430 --> 28:41.230]  This is the truest Tony show I've ever been on.
[28:46.230 --> 28:47.430]  Funny, funny stuff.
[28:47.870 --> 28:48.710]  There you are.
[28:50.710 --> 28:53.330]  Can you hear us, Kai?
[28:55.530 --> 28:58.500]  Hello, hello.
[29:00.100 --> 29:02.380]  Josh, I think it's just gonna be you and me talking.
[29:02.380 --> 29:03.220]  Okay, bro.
[29:08.270 --> 29:11.310]  I wanted to ask Joe, is his name?
[29:11.310 --> 29:14.150]  I wanted to ask him how much money
[29:14.150 --> 29:16.150]  did you make in the last three years?
[29:16.150 --> 29:17.950]  I think it was like $1,000.
[29:17.950 --> 29:19.750]  I think it was like $1,000.
[29:19.910 --> 29:24.310]  I wanted to ask him how much was like
[29:24.310 --> 29:26.510]  eights in London and stuff.
[29:28.230 --> 29:30.990]  So eights in London are like 1.5.
[29:30.990 --> 29:33.710]  That's what they call eights in London.
[29:33.710 --> 29:35.270]  It's because their fucking,
[29:37.510 --> 29:39.830]  their measuring system like the rest of the world's
[29:39.830 --> 29:41.670]  is right and ours is wrong.
[29:44.830 --> 29:46.830]  How much money was it?
[29:46.950 --> 29:49.710]  3.5 would be like 70 pounds,
[29:49.710 --> 29:53.710]  which at that time was about $110.
[29:53.710 --> 29:54.550]  Damn.
[29:56.670 --> 29:58.270]  It was fire or it wasn't fire?
[29:58.270 --> 30:01.750]  No, it was mediocre as fuck, bro.
[30:01.750 --> 30:05.790]  Spider mice all over that shit, bro, like garbage.
[30:06.790 --> 30:09.350]  Supposedly it's the Vietnamese gangsters
[30:09.350 --> 30:11.710]  that slain that shit on the streets in London.
[30:12.630 --> 30:13.470]  Weird.
[30:13.470 --> 30:16.190]  Yeah, so I didn't have a link.
[30:16.230 --> 30:18.630]  I didn't have a link at that time.
[30:18.630 --> 30:22.630]  So I had to, it was like 420 pounds an ounce.
[30:22.630 --> 30:26.630]  So I think that at that time was like $560
[30:29.350 --> 30:32.830]  for like a four out of 10, like just garbage.
[30:32.830 --> 30:36.230]  Like I never smoked weed like that in my life.
[30:36.230 --> 30:37.070]  It was hard time.
[30:37.070 --> 30:40.710]  So when I say I cried in Spain, when I smoked that kush,
[30:40.710 --> 30:43.670]  I legitimately like cried, bro.
[30:43.670 --> 30:44.710]  Like I'm not joking.
[30:44.710 --> 30:46.710]  I don't know, I'm being serious.
[30:46.710 --> 30:49.990]  It was like, fuck, like I haven't smoked this shit.
[30:49.990 --> 30:53.030]  And it was like every, and I felt like home.
[30:53.030 --> 30:55.350]  I just felt like finally,
[30:55.350 --> 30:57.870]  I felt like comfortable and shit, you know what I'm saying?
[30:57.870 --> 31:02.870]  We have an important soccer question, football question.
[31:02.910 --> 31:03.750]  I'm sorry.
[31:03.750 --> 31:05.190]  Tottenham though, I was about to go to a Tottenham game
[31:05.190 --> 31:07.830]  when I was in London before the pandemic in March.
[31:07.830 --> 31:09.510]  I was about to go that Friday
[31:09.510 --> 31:12.110]  and then they shut everything down that fucking Wednesday
[31:12.150 --> 31:14.750]  and I was fucking so pissed, bro.
[31:14.750 --> 31:15.990]  I was so pissed.
[31:15.990 --> 31:18.470]  Yeah, man, but Tottenham's my homies really,
[31:18.470 --> 31:19.670]  they love Tottenham.
[31:19.670 --> 31:21.150]  But them gangsters in Tottenham,
[31:21.150 --> 31:24.030]  they don't, you know, you know what I'm saying?
[31:24.030 --> 31:27.790]  Yeah, Chelsea are more like the rich cats and shit.
[31:27.790 --> 31:29.150]  You know, like, yeah.
[31:30.350 --> 31:31.590]  But yeah, I fuck with footy
[31:31.590 --> 31:33.750]  because I used to play football like 11 years
[31:33.750 --> 31:35.350]  when I was a youngster and shit.
[31:40.970 --> 31:43.210]  So let's see if Kaya's back.
[31:43.210 --> 31:44.050]  It's blessed though, bro.
[31:44.410 --> 31:45.650]  I was telling, me and Kaya
[31:45.650 --> 31:46.650]  having a conversation the other day,
[31:46.650 --> 31:48.370]  like, you know, I'm blessed.
[31:48.370 --> 31:50.690]  I get to enjoy having my wife be from London
[31:50.690 --> 31:52.930]  so I get to go travel and visit London.
[31:52.930 --> 31:55.330]  Kaya's wife is from fucking Hawaii.
[31:55.330 --> 31:58.170]  So he gets to go to fucking Hawaii every time and shit.
[31:58.170 --> 32:01.090]  So like my shit's dope, but like not as dope as Kaya's.
[32:01.090 --> 32:01.930]  You know what I'm saying?
[32:01.930 --> 32:04.650]  That's next level shit right there, bro.
[32:06.770 --> 32:08.850]  I've never even been to Hawaii, to be honest.
[32:08.850 --> 32:11.290]  Washington State is in the house tonight.
[32:14.650 --> 32:15.490]  So.
[32:15.490 --> 32:18.490]  Sorry, I think my tech difficulty's over here.
[32:18.490 --> 32:20.130]  Can you hear me now, Peter?
[32:20.130 --> 32:20.970]  Yep, now you're good.
[32:20.970 --> 32:22.650]  Yeah, you're just choppy, bro.
[32:22.650 --> 32:25.490]  Oh, there you are, now you're sideways for a second.
[32:30.050 --> 32:30.890]  You're back.
[32:30.890 --> 32:32.850]  That happens when you're smoking good hash.
[32:35.850 --> 32:36.850]  Yeah, no, it was funny
[32:36.850 --> 32:38.650]  because you were just, you were frozen
[32:38.650 --> 32:41.050]  with just a shit-eating grin on your face
[32:41.050 --> 32:42.690]  for like 10 minutes.
[32:46.510 --> 32:48.790]  And he's frozen again.
[32:49.910 --> 32:51.310]  What's everyone smoking on?
[32:54.590 --> 32:55.430]  Just some.
[32:55.430 --> 32:58.630]  So tonight I got some pink lemonade six star.
[33:01.790 --> 33:05.110]  I got some regular ass Missouri dabs here.
[33:05.990 --> 33:07.430]  Nothing to write home about.
[33:08.870 --> 33:10.990]  What do you say, Missouri dabs, like BHO?
[33:12.550 --> 33:13.990]  You know, I don't even know, man.
[33:13.990 --> 33:15.830]  I think it is, I think it's, yeah,
[33:15.830 --> 33:18.270]  something, nothing too awesome.
[33:18.270 --> 33:20.990]  We just got dispensaries, like right now,
[33:20.990 --> 33:21.830]  like in the last month.
[33:21.830 --> 33:22.950]  What's up?
[33:22.950 --> 33:24.390]  Yeah, yeah.
[33:24.390 --> 33:26.910]  So, but I mean, I'm not going to the dispensaries.
[33:26.910 --> 33:29.430]  I still get it from the homies, though.
[33:29.430 --> 33:31.190]  Of course, because you have those plugs.
[33:31.190 --> 33:32.030]  Why would you, bro?
[33:32.030 --> 33:33.150]  Yeah, man.
[33:33.150 --> 33:34.390]  The black market will flourish
[33:34.390 --> 33:36.630]  for at least another five years in Oklahoma.
[33:36.630 --> 33:38.790]  At least before it starts to get fire
[33:38.790 --> 33:40.550]  in the dispensaries, like.
[33:41.270 --> 33:46.270]  Damn, so it took, so is it decriminalized
[33:48.310 --> 33:50.110]  or just medical?
[33:50.110 --> 33:53.270]  Just, well, yeah, just medical.
[33:53.270 --> 33:57.350]  Cause I mean, it got to an ounce is decriminalized.
[33:57.350 --> 33:59.390]  Okay, that's A, that's what's up.
[33:59.390 --> 34:00.470]  That's what's A, dude.
[34:00.470 --> 34:01.950]  That's a start, you know what I'm saying?
[34:01.950 --> 34:02.990]  Fuck yeah.
[34:02.990 --> 34:03.830]  But we have medical.
[34:03.830 --> 34:05.910]  I'm sure some parts of the country are like,
[34:05.910 --> 34:08.150]  so behind, yo, like, honestly, no shit.
[34:08.230 --> 34:11.510]  The fact that it's been 96 in California,
[34:11.510 --> 34:15.750]  like, man, that shit's, it's so ridiculous
[34:15.750 --> 34:18.550]  that some parts of the country are so fucking far behind.
[34:18.550 --> 34:19.390]  That shit is.
[34:19.390 --> 34:22.870]  Oh, bro, it's, that's before pandemic,
[34:22.870 --> 34:24.750]  that was my job was traveling around.
[34:24.750 --> 34:27.670]  You know, I play music and touring all the time.
[34:27.670 --> 34:32.670]  And it is crazy to like play a show in Colorado
[34:33.190 --> 34:35.190]  and everybody hands you like all this weed
[34:35.190 --> 34:37.950]  and you get all this weed from all your homies and friends.
[34:38.710 --> 34:39.550]  And they have all the hookups.
[34:39.550 --> 34:41.790]  And then you like, you have to go to Kansas
[34:41.790 --> 34:43.430]  or Missouri the next day.
[34:43.430 --> 34:46.110]  And I'm like, what the fuck do I do with all this weed, dude?
[34:46.110 --> 34:48.270]  Like give it to all my friends and give it away, you know,
[34:48.270 --> 34:51.070]  because there's no way in hell I'm going to Kansas
[34:51.070 --> 34:52.910]  with any weed at all.
[34:52.910 --> 34:55.350]  Damn, bro, that's fucking.
[34:55.350 --> 34:58.350]  So you even, would you drive or fly?
[34:58.350 --> 34:59.670]  Well, we drive most of the time.
[34:59.670 --> 35:00.790]  And you still wouldn't?
[35:00.790 --> 35:01.990]  And you still wouldn't even,
[35:01.990 --> 35:03.590]  even in driving you wouldn't take it?
[35:03.590 --> 35:05.910]  No, because I just, I'm on tour all the time.
[35:06.030 --> 35:08.030]  So I can't jeopardize my job like that.
[35:08.030 --> 35:08.870]  You know what I'm saying?
[35:08.870 --> 35:09.710]  That's what's up.
[35:09.710 --> 35:12.230]  But, and when I get to the next show,
[35:12.230 --> 35:14.670]  somebody will give me weed, you know, it always happens.
[35:14.670 --> 35:15.670]  I'm already nervous.
[35:15.670 --> 35:17.670]  Guaranteed, guaranteed.
[35:18.750 --> 35:21.710]  But it does suck for like, you know,
[35:21.710 --> 35:24.070]  eight to 10 hour drives sometimes, you know,
[35:24.070 --> 35:26.070]  you're just like, oh my God.
[35:26.070 --> 35:29.070]  And I just had so much dank weed and had to give it all up.
[35:29.070 --> 35:32.630]  Damn, man, so yeah, man, that's struggles for sure.
[35:34.110 --> 35:35.790]  But yeah, I feel you is what I was saying, man.
[35:36.670 --> 35:38.590]  It's so weird to the imaginary line,
[35:38.590 --> 35:39.510]  you know what I'm saying?
[35:39.510 --> 35:40.670]  That you're just smoking right here
[35:40.670 --> 35:42.070]  and then you cross an imaginary line
[35:42.070 --> 35:44.350]  and it's like, chill.
[35:44.350 --> 35:45.470]  It's so weird.
[35:47.550 --> 35:50.150]  But that decriminalization though is key, bro.
[35:50.150 --> 35:52.070]  In most States, they won't decriminalize it,
[35:52.070 --> 35:54.870]  but they'll have these fucking random shitty laws,
[35:54.870 --> 35:56.950]  but people still get locked up.
[35:56.950 --> 35:58.510]  It's like, wait, wait, wait, I thought there was this.
[35:58.510 --> 35:59.950]  It's like, oh no, no, no, no, no, no.
[35:59.950 --> 36:01.390]  We still arrest your ass.
[36:01.390 --> 36:02.230]  Trust me.
[36:02.230 --> 36:04.070]  Like, yeah, don't get it twisted.
[36:04.070 --> 36:05.230]  Don't get it twisted.
[36:05.590 --> 36:07.030]  It's fucking ridiculous.
[36:09.510 --> 36:12.070]  For hash smuggled and fucking from Morocco to Spain
[36:12.070 --> 36:12.910]  is a thing.
[36:12.910 --> 36:15.550]  Like that whole thing has been cut off because of Corona.
[36:15.550 --> 36:18.150]  Like I have homies struggling.
[36:18.150 --> 36:21.150]  Like Spaniards are huge into that Moroccan hash.
[36:21.150 --> 36:22.830]  If they're not making it, growing it
[36:22.830 --> 36:26.190]  and washing it themselves,
[36:26.190 --> 36:27.430]  they're struggling out there right now
[36:27.430 --> 36:30.470]  because they definitely, all the pipelines have shut down
[36:30.470 --> 36:31.830]  because of Corona bullshit.
[36:32.070 --> 36:32.910]  Oh yeah.
[36:34.910 --> 36:36.230]  What's he gonna say?
[36:36.230 --> 36:37.070]  Fucking.
[36:39.830 --> 36:41.790]  Kai, do you make old world hash?
[36:44.870 --> 36:46.990]  Yeah, of course.
[36:46.990 --> 36:47.990]  That's what's up.
[36:47.990 --> 36:48.830]  We just post it.
[36:48.830 --> 36:49.670]  You never post any, bro.
[36:49.670 --> 36:51.030]  That's why you never post it.
[36:52.830 --> 36:56.510]  Because mostly that stuff goes to old world places.
[36:57.550 --> 36:59.150]  People would love that shit.
[36:59.150 --> 37:01.030]  If you're on the volley right now, holla.
[37:01.030 --> 37:01.870]  I got you.
[37:03.630 --> 37:04.550]  Nah, nah.
[37:04.550 --> 37:05.510]  It's interesting though,
[37:05.510 --> 37:06.990]  because if you would post that shit,
[37:06.990 --> 37:08.510]  you would get a lot of,
[37:08.510 --> 37:10.630]  you'd trip out how many people would hit you up.
[37:13.470 --> 37:14.310]  Because it's just-
[37:14.310 --> 37:15.990]  I love off-world hash.
[37:15.990 --> 37:17.350]  Yeah, I can't.
[37:17.350 --> 37:19.390]  If I smoked flour,
[37:19.390 --> 37:22.430]  I think I would enjoy that type of hash more.
[37:22.430 --> 37:23.750]  You know what I'm saying?
[37:23.750 --> 37:25.790]  Honestly, I've been thinking about smoking flour
[37:25.790 --> 37:27.590]  more recently,
[37:27.590 --> 37:30.950]  because I just don't feel like dabbing hash
[37:30.950 --> 37:32.550]  all day, every day.
[37:32.550 --> 37:34.230]  It's very healthy for my lungs and shit.
[37:34.230 --> 37:35.070]  You know what I'm saying?
[37:35.070 --> 37:37.070]  I've been doing it since I moved back.
[37:37.070 --> 37:38.870]  That was almost six years ago.
[37:38.870 --> 37:42.550]  Straight, just hash, hash, and more hash.
[37:44.470 --> 37:46.510]  Good flours are profuse where I'm at.
[37:46.510 --> 37:48.990]  So it's not like I could throw a rock type shit.
[37:52.270 --> 37:57.270]  I feel like I went the wrong road, bro.
[37:57.270 --> 37:58.510]  I went hash,
[37:58.510 --> 37:59.670]  and all my homies went flour,
[37:59.670 --> 38:00.710]  because they love flour.
[38:01.470 --> 38:02.550]  And I used to love flour.
[38:02.550 --> 38:03.430]  And when I lived in London,
[38:03.430 --> 38:07.470]  I stopped smoking flour because I couldn't get any flour.
[38:08.510 --> 38:10.190]  Like fire flour.
[38:10.190 --> 38:12.830]  So that's when I started smoking extracts and shit,
[38:12.830 --> 38:15.430]  because it was easier.
[38:15.430 --> 38:17.990]  I could be anywhere smoking.
[38:17.990 --> 38:21.430]  I could literally be in the museum looking at Raphael
[38:21.430 --> 38:22.790]  and fucking hitting my pen,
[38:22.790 --> 38:25.430]  and nobody would know anything and shit.
[38:25.430 --> 38:26.990]  I could be on the tube and the subway.
[38:26.990 --> 38:29.670]  I could be in the movie theaters with the pen,
[38:29.670 --> 38:31.470]  and they don't really fucking know what's up.
[38:31.470 --> 38:34.550]  At that time, especially, extracts were so new.
[38:35.390 --> 38:36.830]  So that's literally the only reason
[38:36.830 --> 38:38.110]  why I started smoking extracts
[38:38.110 --> 38:41.470]  was because of not being able to source quality flour.
[38:41.470 --> 38:42.310]  And I love flour.
[38:42.310 --> 38:45.750]  I've been smoking flour since I was 14.
[38:45.750 --> 38:46.590]  You know what I'm saying?
[38:46.590 --> 38:47.430]  Like a young ass kid.
[38:47.430 --> 38:49.230]  So I enjoy flour,
[38:49.230 --> 38:50.990]  and I always have had fire hash flour.
[38:50.990 --> 38:53.710]  Now I just have the fire hash all the time.
[38:53.710 --> 38:55.110]  So that's never a choice.
[38:56.230 --> 38:57.430]  I like both.
[38:57.430 --> 38:59.310]  There's different occasions.
[38:59.510 --> 39:01.190]  Sometimes I really wanna have a joint.
[39:01.190 --> 39:02.470]  That's valid.
[39:02.470 --> 39:05.350]  I like to smoke some weed with the hash sometimes.
[39:05.350 --> 39:06.710]  That's valid.
[39:06.710 --> 39:07.870]  It's valid.
[39:07.870 --> 39:09.710]  Sometimes I just wanna roll up and smoke a joint.
[39:09.710 --> 39:11.430]  I've been thinking about that recently.
[39:11.430 --> 39:13.230]  But to be completely fucking honest,
[39:14.230 --> 39:15.950]  the smell gets me fucking almost,
[39:15.950 --> 39:17.830]  I'm almost like bougie,
[39:17.830 --> 39:19.150]  and it gets me nauseous and shit.
[39:19.150 --> 39:19.990]  I smell that shit,
[39:19.990 --> 39:22.230]  I'm like, I almost get irritable by that shit.
[39:22.230 --> 39:24.950]  I'm like, oh, this really, it doesn't smell like,
[39:24.950 --> 39:25.790]  you know what I'm saying?
[39:25.790 --> 39:26.990]  Then I'm all smelling like that shit after.
[39:26.990 --> 39:28.990]  It just, I don't know, bro.
[39:29.670 --> 39:30.510]  That whole smoking shit.
[39:30.510 --> 39:32.470]  That whole smoking shit.
[39:32.470 --> 39:33.310]  I don't know, bro.
[39:33.310 --> 39:36.270]  It's just, you know, and then it tastes like dot dot.
[39:36.270 --> 39:37.830]  No matter what I put in it,
[39:37.830 --> 39:40.910]  whether it's like eight different types of hash
[39:40.910 --> 39:44.310]  and fucking rosin and fire ass flour,
[39:44.310 --> 39:47.950]  it still tastes like ass to me, bro.
[39:47.950 --> 39:49.910]  And I'm talking like fire flour.
[39:49.910 --> 39:53.750]  Like, can't get, like, I'm just,
[39:53.750 --> 39:57.350]  I'm just saying that's personally.
[39:57.430 --> 39:59.430]  Yeah, I feel the same way.
[39:59.430 --> 40:01.350]  I only use the Puffco when I'm abroad, bro.
[40:01.350 --> 40:03.950]  It's the best fucking thing to use when you travel.
[40:03.950 --> 40:04.790]  Like it's the best.
[40:04.790 --> 40:05.630]  Yeah, bro.
[40:07.950 --> 40:11.070]  That's what I was gonna say about the dabbing too, though,
[40:11.070 --> 40:13.990]  is that I love to smoke everywhere I go.
[40:13.990 --> 40:14.950]  Like, this is my thing.
[40:14.950 --> 40:16.190]  Like, even if I'm going to Walmart,
[40:16.190 --> 40:19.390]  I'd pull up in the parking lot, do a dab real quick.
[40:19.390 --> 40:21.750]  But that's why I love the Puffco, bro.
[40:21.750 --> 40:22.950]  It's G, man.
[40:22.950 --> 40:25.190]  Mm, so G.
[40:25.190 --> 40:26.310]  You guys have the new one?
[40:26.310 --> 40:28.030]  This is the brand new one.
[40:28.030 --> 40:29.630]  Nah, how is it?
[40:29.630 --> 40:34.190]  Dude, you put the fucking, you use it with the app?
[40:34.190 --> 40:36.070]  Oh my God.
[40:36.070 --> 40:38.190]  All the problems with the old Puffco, man,
[40:38.190 --> 40:40.470]  this thing is solved, dude.
[40:40.470 --> 40:45.230]  So I don't buy first generation shit normally, bro.
[40:45.230 --> 40:47.870]  And I let everyone else buy and do the deficiency shit
[40:47.870 --> 40:50.190]  and I'll get like the second, third generation.
[40:50.190 --> 40:52.790]  But until I travel again, bro, then I'll buy it
[40:52.790 --> 40:55.110]  because the other one that I have, it's busted.
[40:55.110 --> 40:58.950]  So I've already told myself when I do travel again,
[40:58.950 --> 41:01.190]  I'm definitely gonna buy that shit for sure.
[41:01.190 --> 41:02.670]  It's worth it, man.
[41:02.670 --> 41:05.350]  I watched all like the different videos
[41:05.350 --> 41:08.430]  of like people checking them out before I bought it
[41:08.430 --> 41:09.430]  just to make sure.
[41:09.430 --> 41:11.670]  And everyone was raving about it.
[41:11.670 --> 41:13.950]  So yeah, it's amazing, man.
[41:15.470 --> 41:17.950]  I took it to Paris and I'm smoking.
[41:17.950 --> 41:19.670]  I'm walking to the Arc de Triomphe, bro,
[41:19.670 --> 41:22.510]  and I see my name tatted on the Arc de Triomphe, bro.
[41:22.510 --> 41:23.790]  Like, there's my name, Ocana.
[41:23.790 --> 41:25.590]  And I'm just walking up all stoned.
[41:27.030 --> 41:28.430]  And I see my name on that shit.
[41:28.430 --> 41:30.110]  I'm like, what the fuck?
[41:30.110 --> 41:32.710]  So I'm like, babe, we're gonna smoke underneath that shit.
[41:32.710 --> 41:35.590]  Like we're packing the fucking puff coat.
[41:35.590 --> 41:37.830]  And then she videoed me taking dabs, that shit.
[41:37.830 --> 41:39.350]  I'm like that, I'm like you, bro.
[41:39.350 --> 41:41.070]  Like we smoked everywhere, bro.
[41:41.070 --> 41:44.390]  In Sagrada Familia, we're smoking in there.
[41:44.390 --> 41:46.150]  In the booth, we're fucking chiefing.
[41:46.150 --> 41:49.550]  Like I'm trying to smoke everywhere, bro.
[41:49.550 --> 41:51.190]  If I get kicked out, if I, you know what I'm saying?
[41:51.190 --> 41:52.910]  Like a couple of times I almost got arrested.
[41:52.990 --> 41:54.910]  I got a death sentence for being over there and shit.
[41:54.910 --> 41:56.230]  I'm about that shit, bro.
[41:56.230 --> 41:58.150]  I take, when I used to smoke weed,
[41:58.150 --> 42:00.590]  I smoke like as soon as I'm going to Buckingham Palace gates
[42:00.590 --> 42:03.670]  and I'm lining up a joint with the W and shit.
[42:03.670 --> 42:05.030]  I got pictures of that shit.
[42:06.510 --> 42:07.750]  Cause I'm from where I'm from, bro.
[42:07.750 --> 42:10.310]  And it's very illegal there, but I was like, fuck this.
[42:10.310 --> 42:11.590]  I'm not gonna be afraid, dude.
[42:11.590 --> 42:14.590]  I'm gonna smoke like I smoke in California.
[42:14.590 --> 42:19.150]  In hindsight, I was a dumb fuck, like on some real shit.
[42:19.150 --> 42:22.310]  Because in 2012, they had bombings.
[42:22.750 --> 42:25.470]  So like they got huge on CCTV
[42:25.470 --> 42:30.470]  and they're one of the most video camera cities in the world.
[42:30.470 --> 42:33.070]  And there I was like just being a dumb ass, bro.
[42:33.070 --> 42:35.350]  And like making my girlfriend very, very uncomfortable
[42:35.350 --> 42:37.110]  without her knowing, cause she's very English
[42:37.110 --> 42:38.670]  and she would never say anything about it.
[42:38.670 --> 42:42.950]  So, years later, years later, she finally told me.
[42:42.950 --> 42:44.470]  You scared the crap out of me.
[42:44.470 --> 42:45.910]  Oh my God, bro.
[42:45.910 --> 42:47.830]  So many times, so many times.
[42:47.950 --> 42:50.950]  Man, I got some stories about hitting the pens
[42:50.950 --> 42:53.550]  on the airplanes, but I'll save that for next time.
[42:53.550 --> 42:54.390]  Nah, nah, nah.
[42:54.390 --> 42:55.630]  Share, share.
[42:58.350 --> 43:00.670]  That's some scary shit.
[43:00.670 --> 43:04.950]  Bro, on the last plane, we were going through Corona shit.
[43:04.950 --> 43:06.910]  We went to London for a month before
[43:06.910 --> 43:10.150]  and we went to Barcelona in March.
[43:10.150 --> 43:13.390]  And on the way there, my homie made some 90 Urozen pens
[43:13.390 --> 43:16.110]  and shit and they're fire and it was the plum crazy
[43:16.910 --> 43:19.430]  and it smells like grapes.
[43:19.430 --> 43:21.910]  It's so fire, it's so fucking delicious.
[43:21.910 --> 43:24.790]  And I'm hitting that shit on the pen, on the plane,
[43:24.790 --> 43:25.830]  cause I always do, yo.
[43:25.830 --> 43:27.390]  Like that's not even a question.
[43:27.390 --> 43:32.390]  Like I'm eating edibles, but I'm also hitting the pens.
[43:32.870 --> 43:34.670]  London's like an 11 hour flight.
[43:34.670 --> 43:36.510]  That shit's not fun at all.
[43:36.510 --> 43:39.230]  And we take the red eye and they dim the lights
[43:39.230 --> 43:40.670]  so everyone can sleep.
[43:40.670 --> 43:43.150]  They make it even easier for me when I get like,
[43:43.150 --> 43:43.990]  come on, dude.
[43:43.990 --> 43:46.150]  You put that little fan thing on, right?
[43:46.150 --> 43:48.630]  You put the fan thing on, it points right at you.
[43:48.630 --> 43:50.470]  And then I put my hoodie on.
[43:50.470 --> 43:53.470]  And then I'm looking out the window type shit.
[43:53.470 --> 43:54.630]  And then I'm just doing this shit
[43:54.630 --> 43:56.790]  and then hold it like little tokes
[43:56.790 --> 43:59.390]  and then holding that shit deep, like real deep.
[43:59.390 --> 44:00.750]  And then this shit.
[44:00.750 --> 44:03.110]  Ghosting it, ghost that shit.
[44:03.110 --> 44:04.430]  Bro.
[44:04.430 --> 44:06.030]  But then the fuck, they get on the speaker
[44:06.030 --> 44:07.470]  cause my wife was like slacking.
[44:07.470 --> 44:09.710]  She takes big old ones and then it's smoky.
[44:09.710 --> 44:11.070]  And I'm like, you're a burn, yo.
[44:12.030 --> 44:14.510]  So they fucking announced on the radio,
[44:14.510 --> 44:16.510]  smoking pens are illegal.
[44:16.510 --> 44:18.230]  You cannot smoke on the plane.
[44:18.230 --> 44:19.550]  I'm just looking at my wife like,
[44:19.550 --> 44:21.990]  oh shit, yo, that was about us.
[44:21.990 --> 44:23.070]  That was about us.
[44:23.070 --> 44:23.910]  Like straight up.
[44:23.910 --> 44:24.990]  Oh shit.
[44:24.990 --> 44:25.830]  All right, all right.
[44:25.830 --> 44:27.070]  I'm gonna reveal the tech.
[44:29.230 --> 44:30.070]  I'm sorry?
[44:30.070 --> 44:30.910]  I'm gonna reveal the tech.
[44:30.910 --> 44:34.110]  So I read this book a long time ago about a smuggler.
[44:34.110 --> 44:36.430]  It was called the Life and Death of Bobby Z.
[44:36.430 --> 44:40.430]  And this cat was smuggling heroin from Southeast Asia.
[44:40.510 --> 44:42.710]  But he would always smoke on the airplane.
[44:43.590 --> 44:45.830]  So the trick is you go to the bathroom
[44:45.830 --> 44:48.550]  and when you hit the pan, when you exhale,
[44:48.550 --> 44:50.510]  you flush the toilet and blow it down
[44:50.510 --> 44:53.230]  and all that suction is gonna blow that right out.
[44:53.230 --> 44:55.830]  And yeah, that's my little tip for the day.
[44:59.900 --> 45:00.740]  Yeah.
[45:03.500 --> 45:05.140]  You gotta unmute yourself.
[45:07.460 --> 45:09.860]  But whatever you're saying is probably amazing.
[45:13.020 --> 45:14.340]  I bet that was gold.
[45:14.340 --> 45:16.780]  I do that in the bathroom too.
[45:16.780 --> 45:18.660]  But mostly I just hold it like a lot
[45:18.660 --> 45:21.100]  and then people come in next and they smell turps,
[45:21.100 --> 45:21.940]  but not turds.
[45:21.940 --> 45:22.780]  Turps, yeah.
[45:22.780 --> 45:23.620]  Ah!
[45:25.660 --> 45:27.660]  That's some nice smelling turds.
[45:28.500 --> 45:32.220]  Oh man, I've had a bad fire
[45:32.220 --> 45:33.900]  and the stewardess came and was like,
[45:33.900 --> 45:34.740]  what's that smell?
[45:34.740 --> 45:37.020]  And I was like, oh, that's the dreadlock spray.
[45:40.020 --> 45:41.180]  What's Hawaii saying?
[45:41.220 --> 45:43.580]  What's Hawaii saying, Kaya, with the fire hash?
[45:46.420 --> 45:49.620]  Man, yo, I'm telling you,
[45:49.620 --> 45:51.740]  the metaphysical grade is on the big island.
[45:51.740 --> 45:53.740]  They got the best hash on the planet, period.
[45:53.740 --> 45:54.580]  I don't doubt it.
[45:55.580 --> 45:57.620]  Don't doubt it, period.
[45:57.620 --> 45:59.700]  The sun makes it that good.
[46:00.700 --> 46:02.500]  You know, it's iry.
[46:02.500 --> 46:05.060]  What I wanna know, hey Josh, what do you got going on?
[46:05.060 --> 46:08.340]  I know you're not doing any shows right now,
[46:08.340 --> 46:10.780]  but what do you have on the burners for music and stuff?
[46:10.780 --> 46:11.780]  You know, what are you doing right now?
[46:12.380 --> 46:13.220]  Talk to us.
[46:14.300 --> 46:17.220]  Just released an album in March,
[46:17.220 --> 46:20.420]  or February, called Resist.
[46:20.420 --> 46:23.820]  And I got another album coming out
[46:23.820 --> 46:27.060]  probably maybe December or January.
[46:27.060 --> 46:29.460]  But yeah, just working on music, man,
[46:29.460 --> 46:33.260]  because definitely not touring or traveling right now.
[46:33.260 --> 46:36.340]  Do you wanna play a song off the new album?
[46:36.340 --> 46:38.300]  Sure, I can, yeah, I can play an album.
[46:38.300 --> 46:39.460]  Or an old album?
[46:39.460 --> 46:42.580]  I don't know, how many albums have you released?
[46:42.580 --> 46:44.980]  20 years of albums, so I don't know,
[46:44.980 --> 46:46.780]  probably like 10 to 15 albums.
[46:49.460 --> 46:51.660]  But yeah, I'll jam for you guys, no problem.
[46:51.660 --> 46:52.540]  All right.
[46:52.540 --> 46:56.780]  This is, I got a lot of weed tunes, I like weed, so.
[46:56.780 --> 46:57.620]  Great.
[47:02.100 --> 47:03.500]  Song's called Cannabis.

[49:28.500 --> 49:30.500]  Show us dope, bro.
[49:30.500 --> 49:32.500]  Thank you, guys.
[49:32.500 --> 49:34.500]  Thank you, guys.
[49:34.500 --> 49:36.500]  Awesome to be on here.
[49:36.500 --> 49:38.500]  Thanks for having me on here, guys, man.
[49:38.500 --> 49:40.500]  It's awesome.
[49:40.500 --> 49:42.500]  Man, thank you for vibing out.
[49:42.500 --> 49:44.500]  My babies miss you.
[49:44.500 --> 49:46.500]  Oh, man.
[49:46.500 --> 49:48.500]  A whole bunch of times, my babies really love you, man.
[49:48.500 --> 49:50.500]  They really do.
[49:50.500 --> 49:52.500]  Hell yeah.
[49:52.500 --> 49:54.500]  I love them.
[49:54.500 --> 49:56.500]  Good babies.
[49:56.500 --> 49:58.500]  Oh, man.
[49:58.500 --> 50:00.500]  That's awesome.
[50:00.500 --> 50:02.500]  Thanks, man.
[50:02.500 --> 50:04.500]  Joseph is a new daddy.
[50:04.500 --> 50:06.500]  Joseph's got a little...
[50:06.500 --> 50:08.500]  Yeah, he's one now.
[50:08.500 --> 50:10.500]  We're expecting our second one in April.
[50:10.500 --> 50:12.500]  So, yeah.
[50:12.500 --> 50:14.500]  Thank you, man.
[50:14.500 --> 50:16.500]  Thank you.
[50:16.500 --> 50:18.500]  It's been a huge blessing.
[50:18.500 --> 50:20.500]  I never thought I'd have kids, never thought I'd get married.
[50:20.500 --> 50:22.500]  So we started late.
[50:22.500 --> 50:24.500]  And, yeah, it's been...
[50:24.500 --> 50:26.500]  It's wild.
[50:26.500 --> 50:28.500]  It came from my nuts.
[50:28.500 --> 50:30.500]  He knows it.
[50:30.500 --> 50:32.500]  He knows it, too.
[50:32.500 --> 50:34.500]  He knows it, which is wild.
[50:34.500 --> 50:36.500]  Yeah, it's...
[50:36.500 --> 50:38.500]  Yeah, man.
[50:38.500 --> 50:40.500]  I know you know, Kaya.
[50:40.500 --> 50:42.500]  He worships you.
[50:42.500 --> 50:44.500]  The little one.
[50:44.500 --> 50:46.500]  He's starting to dance and shit now.
[50:46.500 --> 50:48.500]  It's a beautiful fucking thing.
[50:48.500 --> 50:50.500]  I was an uncle since I was 13.
[50:50.500 --> 50:52.500]  So it's like...
[50:52.500 --> 50:54.500]  I had 26 years of fucking being an uncle,
[50:54.500 --> 50:56.500]  which was great.
[50:56.500 --> 50:58.500]  And, yeah,
[50:58.500 --> 51:00.500]  Binafale has just been really fucking dope.
[51:00.500 --> 51:02.500]  Straight up.
[51:02.500 --> 51:04.500]  I recommend it to everybody.
[51:04.500 --> 51:06.500]  Yeah, yeah.
[51:06.500 --> 51:08.500]  Yes, sir.
[51:08.500 --> 51:10.500]  Real quick, the touchback to Barcelona
[51:10.500 --> 51:12.500]  and the cannabis clubs.
[51:12.500 --> 51:14.500]  I think I want to pound this in.
[51:14.500 --> 51:16.500]  That the energy right now in Barcelona
[51:16.500 --> 51:18.500]  is so dope.
[51:18.500 --> 51:20.500]  I feel like there's a different energy there
[51:20.500 --> 51:22.500]  because they have that community vibe.
[51:22.500 --> 51:24.500]  Because they have those clubs,
[51:24.500 --> 51:26.500]  but they actually have community.
[51:26.500 --> 51:28.500]  And I feel like we don't really have
[51:28.500 --> 51:30.500]  a lot of community in our country,
[51:30.500 --> 51:32.500]  just in general, with neighborhoods and stuff like that.
[51:32.500 --> 51:34.500]  I don't know if you guys know your neighbors.
[51:34.500 --> 51:36.500]  I know mine, but that's neither here nor there.
[51:36.500 --> 51:38.500]  I would probably think that a lot of them
[51:38.500 --> 51:40.500]  don't really know their neighbors
[51:40.500 --> 51:42.500]  or really don't want to get to know their neighbors.
[51:42.500 --> 51:44.500]  I could probably be implying a lot.
[51:44.500 --> 51:46.500]  And I may be wrong on that.
[51:46.500 --> 51:48.500]  And I hope I am.
[51:48.500 --> 51:50.500]  But the point is that,
[51:50.500 --> 51:52.500]  especially in the cannabis community,
[51:52.500 --> 51:54.500]  I think a lot of people can agree on this.
[51:54.500 --> 51:56.500]  It's very conflicting.
[51:56.500 --> 51:58.500]  People aren't very like...
[51:58.500 --> 52:00.500]  There are some people that share.
[52:00.500 --> 52:02.500]  But there are a lot of people that don't.
[52:02.500 --> 52:04.500]  In Barcelona, it's like an open fucking door policy.
[52:04.500 --> 52:06.500]  It's this thing where you can...
[52:06.500 --> 52:08.500]  Say it's a Tuesday,
[52:08.500 --> 52:10.500]  and one of your homies comes in
[52:10.500 --> 52:12.500]  and he's got some fire
[52:12.500 --> 52:14.500]  that he's grown and washed.
[52:14.500 --> 52:16.500]  And now he's showing you.
[52:16.500 --> 52:18.500]  And now it's just a Tuesday.
[52:18.500 --> 52:20.500]  And now you're getting inspired
[52:20.500 --> 52:22.500]  by seeing this dude.
[52:22.500 --> 52:24.500]  You go home.
[52:24.500 --> 52:26.500]  You come back on maybe Friday.
[52:26.500 --> 52:28.500]  And now he's there.
[52:28.500 --> 52:30.500]  And it's this constant growth
[52:30.500 --> 52:32.500]  of a community.
[52:32.500 --> 52:34.500]  Of this beautiful fucking thing.
[52:34.500 --> 52:36.500]  I know you've seen it, Kai.
[52:36.500 --> 52:38.500]  I know you know what I'm talking about.
[52:38.500 --> 52:40.500]  The energy that you get when you're in these clubs and shit.
[52:40.500 --> 52:42.500]  There's a camaraderie
[52:42.500 --> 52:44.500]  that is highly missing
[52:44.500 --> 52:46.500]  in the American cannabis culture here.
[52:46.500 --> 52:48.500]  In my opinion.
[52:48.500 --> 52:50.500]  It's a beautiful fucking thing.
[52:50.500 --> 52:52.500]  And we don't have cannabis clubs here.
[52:52.500 --> 52:54.500]  I do not know why.
[52:54.500 --> 52:56.500]  I think it's this whole smoking indoors thing.
[52:56.500 --> 52:58.500]  But that shit has to change.
[52:58.500 --> 53:00.500]  Because I feel like cannabis clubs
[53:00.500 --> 53:02.500]  not being here in the States
[53:02.500 --> 53:04.500]  is seriously a lacking issue
[53:04.500 --> 53:06.500]  because of the community thing.
[53:06.500 --> 53:08.500]  And it helps
[53:08.500 --> 53:10.500]  the neighborhood that it's in.
[53:10.500 --> 53:12.500]  That money brings revenue
[53:12.500 --> 53:14.500]  to that neighborhood.
[53:14.500 --> 53:16.500]  People then spend money in those local neighborhoods.
[53:16.500 --> 53:18.500]  And then it keeps recycling into these things.
[53:18.500 --> 53:20.500]  It's a really beautiful fucking thing.
[53:20.500 --> 53:22.500]  I just wanted to pound that in.
[53:22.500 --> 53:24.500]  Because I feel like it's something
[53:24.500 --> 53:26.500]  that's hugely missing in the States.
[53:26.500 --> 53:28.500]  Yeah.
[53:28.500 --> 53:30.500]  Now right before coronavirus hit.
[53:30.500 --> 53:32.500]  I almost pulled the trigger.
[53:32.500 --> 53:34.500]  Can you hear me?
[53:34.500 --> 53:36.500]  So right before coronavirus hit
[53:36.500 --> 53:38.500]  I was about to pull the trigger
[53:38.500 --> 53:40.500]  on like a 4,000 square foot space.
[53:40.500 --> 53:42.500]  A little.
[53:42.500 --> 53:44.500]  Yeah.
[53:44.500 --> 53:46.500]  He's a little frozen.
[53:46.500 --> 53:48.500]  In Santa Monica.
[53:48.500 --> 53:50.500]  Which was going to be exactly that.
[53:50.500 --> 53:52.500]  Basically just like a club
[53:52.500 --> 53:54.500]  where people could get.
[53:54.500 --> 53:56.500]  I mean obviously on the very DL.
[53:56.500 --> 53:58.500]  But a private venue
[53:58.500 --> 54:00.500]  where my friends could all hang out.
[54:00.500 --> 54:02.500]  And bands could play.
[54:02.500 --> 54:04.500]  And DJs could play.
[54:04.500 --> 54:06.500]  And all the LA local
[54:06.500 --> 54:08.500]  hash artisans could
[54:08.500 --> 54:10.500]  come bring their
[54:10.500 --> 54:12.500]  their
[54:12.500 --> 54:14.500]  their six star.
[54:14.500 --> 54:16.500]  But anyway.
[54:16.500 --> 54:18.500]  We have someone asked
[54:18.500 --> 54:20.500]  is Pedro Rosen
[54:20.500 --> 54:22.500]  pressing? So we have a segment which is
[54:22.500 --> 54:24.500]  the live press.
[54:24.500 --> 54:26.500]  And look at that.
[54:26.500 --> 54:28.500]  There's Pedro.
[54:28.500 --> 54:30.500]  Hello everybody.
[54:30.500 --> 54:32.500]  What's up?
[54:32.500 --> 54:34.500]  I've been listening to everybody's stories.
[54:34.500 --> 54:36.500]  And I'm all sitting here all itching.
[54:36.500 --> 54:38.500]  Ready to go on.
[54:38.500 --> 54:40.500]  Happy Thursday everybody.
[54:40.500 --> 54:42.500]  How's everybody doing today?
[54:42.500 --> 54:44.500]  I'm doing pretty well.
[54:44.500 --> 54:46.500]  Thanks for asking.
[54:46.500 --> 54:48.500]  So check it out man.
[54:48.500 --> 54:50.500]  Today we are pressing a 90
[54:50.500 --> 54:52.500]  you stupid fruits.
[54:52.500 --> 54:54.500]  We got the seeds from
[54:54.500 --> 54:56.500]  excuse my little background.
[54:56.500 --> 54:58.500]  This is my little. I'm not professional at all.
[54:58.500 --> 55:00.500]  This is a home
[55:00.500 --> 55:02.500]  amateur guy that loves
[55:02.500 --> 55:04.500]  hash. Been loving hash for a long time.
[55:04.500 --> 55:06.500]  So first of all.
[55:06.500 --> 55:08.500]  I'm nervous.
[55:08.500 --> 55:10.500]  I'm in front of like
[55:10.500 --> 55:12.500]  you don't even know.
[55:12.500 --> 55:14.500]  It's an honor to be in front of this panel.
[55:14.500 --> 55:16.500]  So let me show
[55:16.500 --> 55:18.500]  off my hash if I can.
[55:18.500 --> 55:20.500]  This
[55:20.500 --> 55:22.500]  right here
[55:22.500 --> 55:24.500]  is what I'm working with.
[55:24.500 --> 55:26.500]  It's
[55:26.500 --> 55:28.500]  stupid fruits 90 you
[55:28.500 --> 55:30.500]  first pool. The jeans
[55:30.500 --> 55:32.500]  we got them from Humble
[55:32.500 --> 55:34.500]  Heap Company at the Emerald
[55:34.500 --> 55:36.500]  Cup. And it was a
[55:36.500 --> 55:38.500]  blessing to be honest
[55:38.500 --> 55:40.500]  with you.
[55:40.500 --> 55:42.500]  And I've been I was a little
[55:42.500 --> 55:44.500]  late here but we're working on it.
[55:44.500 --> 55:46.500]  So
[55:46.500 --> 55:48.500]  I like to fill my
[55:48.500 --> 55:50.500]  bags with this little tool.
[55:50.500 --> 55:52.500]  It's a little acetate little sleeve.
[55:52.500 --> 55:54.500]  I buy them at Home Depot slip
[55:54.500 --> 55:56.500]  them down the middle and they're adjustable. You can pretty
[55:56.500 --> 55:58.500]  much squeeze them in
[55:58.500 --> 56:00.500]  open them up and
[56:00.500 --> 56:02.500]  bags nice and steady so you can
[56:02.500 --> 56:04.500]  you know
[56:04.500 --> 56:06.500]  put them in your pocket.
[56:06.500 --> 56:08.500]  Thank you. Thank you.
[56:08.500 --> 56:10.500]  It is really good. I was
[56:10.500 --> 56:12.500]  really surprised with the stupid fruit
[56:12.500 --> 56:14.500]  did I I did for
[56:14.500 --> 56:16.500]  plants and
[56:16.500 --> 56:18.500]  all four females were just
[56:18.500 --> 56:20.500]  amazing to be honest with you.
[56:20.500 --> 56:22.500]  And I've been so busy that I haven't
[56:22.500 --> 56:24.500]  even had a chance to do this press
[56:24.500 --> 56:26.500]  and you know this opportunity came
[56:26.500 --> 56:28.500]  up and here we are.
[56:28.500 --> 56:30.500]  Don't don't don't press it smoke
[56:30.500 --> 56:32.500]  it.
[56:32.500 --> 56:34.500]  Exactly. I'm trying to pull the nice stuff
[56:34.500 --> 56:36.500]  for you guys man trying to show off.
[56:36.500 --> 56:38.500]  You know.
[56:38.500 --> 56:40.500]  Normally one press is beautiful 90 man
[56:40.500 --> 56:42.500]  to be honest with you. Yeah
[56:42.500 --> 56:44.500]  bro I don't think you should. I feel like that's sacrilege
[56:44.500 --> 56:46.500]  to be completely fucking honest.
[56:46.500 --> 56:48.500]  Blasphemy.
[56:48.500 --> 56:50.500]  It basically is.
[56:50.500 --> 56:52.500]  In my opinion
[56:52.500 --> 56:54.500]  it might as well be bro. Awesome real
[56:54.500 --> 56:56.500]  real shit.
[56:56.500 --> 56:58.500]  Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate it.
[56:58.500 --> 57:00.500]  We've been doing
[57:00.500 --> 57:02.500]  all of the cultivars that I've been doing
[57:02.500 --> 57:04.500]  for a long time here in Southern
[57:04.500 --> 57:06.500]  California. They've been
[57:06.500 --> 57:08.500]  dedicated to hash to be honest with you.
[57:08.500 --> 57:10.500]  I hate trimming.
[57:10.500 --> 57:12.500]  So that's the reason why I started making
[57:12.500 --> 57:14.500]  a lot of hash. It was just easier to just
[57:14.500 --> 57:16.500]  take all the good fat leaves off
[57:16.500 --> 57:18.500]  and give it to the worms.
[57:18.500 --> 57:20.500]  And
[57:20.500 --> 57:22.500]  you know
[57:24.500 --> 57:26.500]  use the entire cultivar for hash.
[57:26.500 --> 57:28.500]  But here's my putt man.
[57:28.500 --> 57:30.500]  I'm gonna put it in the press.
[57:30.500 --> 57:32.500]  I got an old style press.
[57:32.500 --> 57:34.500]  Let me see if I can figure out
[57:34.500 --> 57:36.500]  how to turn this camera around.
[57:36.500 --> 57:38.500]  So
[57:38.500 --> 57:40.500]  you gotta tap on the little
[57:40.500 --> 57:42.500]  sprocket and then
[57:42.500 --> 57:44.500]  tap on video
[57:44.500 --> 57:46.500]  and then switch the video
[57:46.500 --> 57:48.500]  camera.
[57:48.500 --> 57:53.110]  And while you're
[57:53.110 --> 57:55.110]  trying to master the camera flip
[57:55.110 --> 57:57.110]  Huncho Grun wants to know what temperature
[57:57.110 --> 57:59.110]  you press at.
[57:59.110 --> 58:01.110]  Okay so I always like to
[58:01.110 --> 58:03.110]  press at super low temperature. I'm that
[58:03.110 --> 58:05.110]  crazy fool that sits here on the press for
[58:05.110 --> 58:07.110]  10 minutes. I like to press between
[58:07.110 --> 58:09.110]  and when you got good melt like this
[58:09.110 --> 58:11.110]  you don't really don't need a lot of pressure
[58:11.110 --> 58:13.110]  nor temperature to mechanically
[58:13.110 --> 58:15.110]  extract it. So I like to press between
[58:15.110 --> 58:17.110]  90 to 110,
[58:17.110 --> 58:19.110]  120 at the most.
[58:19.110 --> 58:21.110]  I like to not
[58:21.110 --> 58:23.110]  you know use
[58:23.110 --> 58:25.110]  I mean I know everybody likes
[58:25.110 --> 58:27.110]  to go a little higher but I just you know
[58:27.110 --> 58:29.110]  I like to go slow and at the end I just
[58:29.110 --> 58:31.110]  you know press it up a little more and
[58:31.110 --> 58:33.110]  just squeeze at the last moment with a little bit more
[58:33.110 --> 58:35.110]  temperature. But I like I don't like to
[58:35.110 --> 58:37.110]  rush the turps to be honest
[58:37.110 --> 58:39.110]  with you. As I'm trying to figure this
[58:39.110 --> 58:41.110]  out. Craig is shocked.
[58:41.110 --> 58:43.110]  Really?
[58:43.110 --> 58:46.450]  Hold on
[58:46.450 --> 58:48.450]  one second guys. I'm trying to figure this out.
[58:48.450 --> 58:50.450]  This is all new to me.
[58:50.450 --> 58:52.450]  No worries.
[58:52.450 --> 58:54.450]  People on this show are very
[58:54.450 --> 58:56.450]  used to the technical
[58:56.450 --> 58:58.450]  the winging it.
[58:58.450 --> 59:00.450]  Yeah.
[59:00.450 --> 59:02.450]  I can't even find the sprocket man.
[59:02.450 --> 59:04.450]  It looks like
[59:04.450 --> 59:06.450]  a little cog.
[59:06.450 --> 59:08.450]  If you tap on your screen
[59:08.450 --> 59:10.450]  and then you'll probably see like a cam
[59:10.450 --> 59:12.450]  microphone.
[59:12.450 --> 59:14.450]  Whoa.
[59:14.450 --> 59:16.450]  Oh my gosh. It's a
[59:16.450 --> 59:18.450]  Josh close up.
[59:18.450 --> 59:20.450]  Action shots
[59:20.450 --> 59:22.450]  of oh my God eating dinner.
[59:26.450 --> 59:28.450]  Anyone. This is a caramel apple.
[59:28.450 --> 59:30.450]  Caramel apples.
[59:30.450 --> 59:32.450]  What? Nice.
[59:32.450 --> 59:34.450]  Is that is that from like the backyard
[59:34.450 --> 59:36.450]  apples or
[59:36.450 --> 59:40.810]  Mommy made these.
[59:40.810 --> 59:42.810]  We're just gonna watch you eat.
[59:42.810 --> 59:44.810]  Mom you want to come say hi to Uncle Josh Heinrichs?
[59:44.810 --> 59:46.810]  Come say hi.
[59:48.810 --> 59:50.810]  Look he's waving to you.
[59:58.950 --> 01:00:00.950]  I miss you.
[01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:02.950]  What Josh you are
[01:00:02.950 --> 01:00:06.290]  muted.
[01:00:06.290 --> 01:00:08.290]  What up? Miss you guys.
[01:00:08.290 --> 01:00:10.290]  Hey.
[01:00:10.290 --> 01:00:12.290]  You better understand that.
[01:00:12.290 --> 01:00:14.290]  We got a little Zaza going on.
[01:00:16.290 --> 01:00:18.290]  So while we're
[01:00:18.290 --> 01:00:20.290]  dealing with Pedro's
[01:00:20.290 --> 01:00:22.290]  technical difficulties, Josh you want to
[01:00:22.290 --> 01:00:24.290]  do a quick rip on the
[01:00:24.290 --> 01:00:26.290]  Puff Go
[01:00:26.290 --> 01:00:28.290]  and then play another song.
[01:00:28.290 --> 01:00:30.290]  Sure. No problem.
[01:00:30.290 --> 01:00:32.290]  Sing us
[01:00:32.290 --> 01:00:34.290]  home Josh.
[01:00:34.290 --> 01:00:36.290]  Sing us home.

[01:00:38.290 --> 01:00:40.290]  Sing our love.
[01:00:42.290 --> 01:00:44.290]  Bless the
[01:00:44.290 --> 01:00:46.290]  Queen of Chi.

[01:02:16.290 --> 01:02:18.290]  I got you back in my life.
[01:02:18.290 --> 01:02:20.290]  Gang yo.
[01:02:20.290 --> 01:02:22.290]  Oh lord.
[01:02:22.290 --> 01:02:24.290]  In my life.
[01:02:24.290 --> 01:02:26.290]  Oh yeah.
[01:02:26.290 --> 01:02:28.290]  Gang yo.
[01:02:28.290 --> 01:02:30.290]  Oh oh.
[01:02:30.290 --> 01:02:32.290]  Oh oh.
[01:02:32.290 --> 01:02:34.290]  Yeah.
[01:02:34.290 --> 01:02:36.290]  Yo.
[01:02:36.290 --> 01:02:38.290]  Say ooh.
[01:02:38.290 --> 01:02:40.290]  Oh.
[01:02:40.290 --> 01:02:42.290]  Oh.
[01:02:42.290 --> 01:02:44.290]  So when I wake up
[01:02:44.290 --> 01:02:46.290]  in the morning.
[01:02:46.290 --> 01:02:48.290]  Lord you know my
[01:02:48.290 --> 01:02:50.290]  ganga pipe.
[01:02:52.290 --> 01:02:54.290]  Make it sweet love
[01:02:54.290 --> 01:02:56.290]  all morning with
[01:02:56.290 --> 01:02:58.290]  Mary Jane.
[01:02:58.290 --> 01:03:00.290]  Say I got
[01:03:00.290 --> 01:03:02.290]  two lovers too.
[01:03:02.290 --> 01:03:04.290]  And I love them both the same.
[01:03:06.290 --> 01:03:08.290]  Yo I love that smoke
[01:03:08.290 --> 01:03:10.290]  since the end of morning.
[01:03:10.290 --> 01:03:12.290]  And I love that blazing
[01:03:12.290 --> 01:03:14.290]  fire all night.
[01:03:14.290 --> 01:03:16.290]  But nothing nothing
[01:03:16.290 --> 01:03:18.290]  does me better.
[01:03:18.290 --> 01:03:20.290]  Than my split and my KD
[01:03:20.290 --> 01:03:22.290]  from my side.
[01:03:22.290 --> 01:03:24.290]  Sweet sesame.
[01:03:24.290 --> 01:03:26.290]  Sweet sesame.
[01:03:28.290 --> 01:03:30.290]  Sweet sesame.
[01:03:34.290 --> 01:03:36.290]  Hey one more time.
[01:03:36.290 --> 01:03:38.290]  So we say gang yo.
[01:03:40.290 --> 01:03:42.290]  I got you back in my life.
[01:03:44.290 --> 01:03:46.290]  Say gang yo.
[01:03:48.290 --> 01:03:50.290]  Oh lord.
[01:03:50.290 --> 01:03:52.290]  We always stay high.
[01:03:52.290 --> 01:03:54.290]  Gang yo.
[01:03:54.290 --> 01:03:56.290]  Gang yo.
[01:03:56.290 --> 01:03:58.290]  Oh lord.
[01:04:04.290 --> 01:04:06.290]  We always stay high.
[01:04:06.290 --> 01:04:08.290]  I'm so sorry for the technical difficulties guys.
[01:04:08.290 --> 01:04:10.290]  I figured it out.
[01:04:10.290 --> 01:04:12.290]  Fart.
[01:04:12.290 --> 01:04:14.290]  Hey.
[01:04:14.290 --> 01:04:16.290]  My iPhone 12 and it's driving me crazy.
[01:04:18.290 --> 01:04:20.290]  I'm sorry.
[01:04:20.290 --> 01:04:22.290]  Fart.
[01:04:22.290 --> 01:04:24.290]  Yes sir.
[01:04:24.290 --> 01:04:26.290]  No worries we were just listening
[01:04:26.290 --> 01:04:28.290]  to some music while you were figuring it out.
[01:04:28.290 --> 01:04:30.290]  Here we go.
[01:04:30.290 --> 01:04:32.290]  Thank you very much.
[01:04:32.290 --> 01:04:35.880]  Back to Pedro.
[01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:37.880]  And back to Pedro.
[01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:39.880]  Sorry.
[01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:41.880]  Harbor Freight.
[01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:43.880]  Okay.
[01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:45.880]  This is the
[01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:47.880]  Ghetto lead.
[01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:49.880]  I've been using this
[01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:51.880]  since 1809.
[01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:53.880]  It works for me.
[01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:55.880]  And it doesn't
[01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:57.880]  have
[01:04:57.880 --> 01:04:59.880]  any temperature
[01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:01.880]  sensors on it.
[01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:03.880]  I used a good
[01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:05.880]  old gun
[01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:07.880]  to check my temperature
[01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:09.880]  and here we go.
[01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:13.020]  What kind of music do you got going on there, buddy?
[01:05:14.420 --> 01:05:17.000]  Josh, do you want to play some...
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.440]  Can you play something dramatic
[01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:21.600]  as we wait for the money shot?
[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:22.440]  Here we go!
[01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:27.440]  ♪♪♪
[01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:35.080]  -♪♪♪
[01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:36.400]  I don't know.
[01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:39.940]  -♪♪♪
[01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:49.700]  So like I said guys, these bags, they're 25U from Roslyn Evolution, double stack, 90U,
[01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:50.700]  first pull.
[01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:52.700]  We'll see what we get.
[01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:59.140]  I haven't pressed this bag yet, so we'll see.
[01:05:59.140 --> 01:06:00.140]  Here she comes.
[01:06:00.140 --> 01:06:01.140]  Oh yeah.
[01:06:01.140 --> 01:06:11.570]  Anybody have any plans for the holidays?
[01:06:11.570 --> 01:06:12.570]  Smoking weed.
[01:06:12.570 --> 01:06:17.330]  My plan is to get a nice hash jarred up for my loved ones.
[01:06:17.330 --> 01:06:20.530]  That's my thing that I love to do for my loved ones.
[01:06:20.530 --> 01:06:24.450]  Everybody that's close to me gets hashed for Christmas.
[01:06:24.450 --> 01:06:28.530]  All the holidays, including Thanksgiving.
[01:06:28.530 --> 01:06:30.530]  I need to be homies with you.
[01:06:30.530 --> 01:06:31.530]  Come on down.
[01:06:31.530 --> 01:06:35.050]  I'm from not that far.
[01:06:36.050 --> 01:06:45.370]  Yeah, and by the way, so how far from Santa Monica are you?
[01:06:45.370 --> 01:06:51.430]  You know, I'm right off the 22 freeway in Beach Boulevard here in Garden Grove.
[01:06:51.430 --> 01:06:52.430]  Not that far.
[01:06:52.430 --> 01:06:53.430]  I need to stop by.
[01:06:53.430 --> 01:06:54.430]  I need to see you.
[01:06:54.430 --> 01:06:55.430]  I'm over there working.
[01:06:55.430 --> 01:07:02.770]  Well, yeah, I feel bad you driving up, but if you have work stuff, definitely let me
[01:07:02.770 --> 01:07:10.850]  know because I would love to dab on, for example, what's oozing out of this right now.
[01:07:10.850 --> 01:07:11.850]  Wow.
[01:07:11.850 --> 01:07:15.490]  Bottom of the bag there.
[01:07:15.490 --> 01:07:21.040]  That's awesome.
[01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:24.440]  And you really can't see any decarb happening.
[01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:26.520]  It's just literally coming out really slow.
[01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:28.040]  I don't know really what that stain is.
[01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:30.320]  It must be a blowout, obviously.
[01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:32.920]  But there's really no pressure on this.
[01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:40.720]  There's double 25s, Rosin Evolution backstack against each other.
[01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:44.600]  But man, you should smell the turps on this beautiful stuff, man.
[01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:48.120]  Scoop and Fruits really surprised the hell out of me this year.
[01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:50.120]  It really did.
[01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:57.700]  Above all the other stuff that I had in the cultivar.
[01:07:57.700 --> 01:07:59.940]  Someone said blowout on right.
[01:07:59.940 --> 01:08:00.940]  I see it.
[01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:01.940]  Oh, yeah.
[01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:06.060]  And there's really no pressure at all.
[01:08:06.060 --> 01:08:07.580]  I mean, it surprised me.
[01:08:07.580 --> 01:08:12.060]  I don't know why what's going on there, but this is going to be a personal stash.
[01:08:12.060 --> 01:08:16.980]  I'm going to hog this entire 90U for sure.
[01:08:16.980 --> 01:08:20.260]  So yeah, it's really nice.
[01:08:20.260 --> 01:08:21.260]  You should be surprised.
[01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:26.220]  I mean, the turps on this super the Humble Seed Company did an awesome job with this
[01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:29.700]  genetics.
[01:08:29.700 --> 01:08:31.580]  It's a really good one, man.
[01:08:32.220 --> 01:08:34.420]  Scoop and Fruits was bred for the band Stupid.
[01:08:34.420 --> 01:08:35.420]  What is it?
[01:08:35.420 --> 01:08:36.420]  Slightly Stupid.
[01:08:36.420 --> 01:08:41.780]  And they use papaya, cantaloupe and strawberry dream queen.
[01:08:41.780 --> 01:08:52.060]  And this particular Fino here, it has the papaya citrus kind of type of Fino.
[01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:58.420]  It's almost like we should get Rosin Evolution technical support on the phone right now.
[01:08:58.420 --> 01:08:59.420]  Right?
[01:08:59.420 --> 01:09:00.420]  Get them on.
[01:09:01.260 --> 01:09:05.580]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, it's Rosin Evolution.
[01:09:05.580 --> 01:09:06.580]  What's up?
[01:09:06.580 --> 01:09:09.100]  Hey, guys, how's it going?
[01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:10.100]  Good.
[01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:11.940]  So we have a blowout right now.
[01:09:11.940 --> 01:09:14.740]  What are your thoughts on this?
[01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:18.460]  It's like the live color commentary play by play.
[01:09:18.460 --> 01:09:19.460]  Is it double bag?
[01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:20.460]  Oh, yeah.
[01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:21.460]  Double bag 25.
[01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:22.460]  Here we go, baby.
[01:09:22.460 --> 01:09:24.800]  Nice.
[01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:34.560]  Honestly, it might be a fold issue.
[01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:37.160]  Did you put it in?
[01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:39.560]  It's beautiful cash.
[01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:46.200]  And honestly, I'm just going to take the rest of whatever remaining is inside those bags
[01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:49.600]  and play with it because that's what I do.
[01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:51.840]  But I'm going to give it another squeeze and see what she does.
[01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:57.080]  Yeah, if you put the two bags in when you put in the second one in, just put the seams
[01:09:57.080 --> 01:09:58.080]  on the opposite ends.
[01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:04.160]  If both are on the same side, then, you know, that's what I've been doing for a long time.
[01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:08.320]  But this particular one, of course, the one where I'm on the spot with all the professionals.
[01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:13.920]  It's like it wouldn't have no luck at all.
[01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:26.150]  But yeah, it's a nice one, man.
[01:10:26.150 --> 01:10:27.150]  What strain is that?
[01:10:27.150 --> 01:10:28.150]  This is Stupid Fruits Extreme Teva.
[01:10:28.150 --> 01:10:35.230]  Obviously, you can tell I just took a dab of that milk.
[01:10:35.230 --> 01:10:37.110]  It's really, really, really nice.
[01:10:37.110 --> 01:10:39.350]  I enjoy it.
[01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:44.190]  Highly recommend this cultivar if anybody or this strain if anybody is looking for it.
[01:10:44.190 --> 01:10:45.190]  I'm a Sativa kind of guy.
[01:10:45.190 --> 01:10:46.190]  Yeah, I love Sativa.
[01:10:46.190 --> 01:10:47.190]  It dumps.
[01:10:47.190 --> 01:10:48.190]  It really dumps for hash.
[01:10:48.190 --> 01:10:57.190]  And the lighting here is not really giving me making any justice, to be honest with you.
[01:10:57.190 --> 01:11:05.630]  But yeah, man, it's just an honor to be on with this channel, you know, with technical
[01:11:05.630 --> 01:11:06.950]  difficulties online.
[01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:10.450]  It's great.
[01:11:10.450 --> 01:11:16.770]  So Pedro, Craig from Alpen Glow Farms wants to get a Got Hash shirt.
[01:11:16.770 --> 01:11:18.530]  How does he pick one up?
[01:11:18.530 --> 01:11:20.890]  You know, I have Greg's information.
[01:11:20.890 --> 01:11:22.330]  He's going to get one here pretty soon.
[01:11:22.330 --> 01:11:26.410]  The thing is that I can't market these shirts for no reason.
[01:11:26.410 --> 01:11:27.450]  There's a patent on them.
[01:11:27.450 --> 01:11:31.730]  So I just make them for myself.
[01:11:31.730 --> 01:11:33.050]  But my friends are going to get something.
[01:11:33.050 --> 01:11:34.050]  Greg, I got your address, bro.
[01:11:34.050 --> 01:11:42.400]  You're going to get one pretty soon.
[01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:46.200]  So Kai, you want to provide some color commentary?
[01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:47.200]  What are you seeing?
[01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:53.280]  Oh my God, we have Papa's, Papa Barkley in the house.
[01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:54.800]  Color commentary.
[01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:55.800]  What do you see?
[01:11:55.800 --> 01:12:03.270]  Sorry, I'm trying to adjust this.
[01:12:03.270 --> 01:12:10.470]  So I'm going to tag it, see what temperature these plates are at.
[01:12:10.470 --> 01:12:13.470]  They're at 121.
[01:12:14.270 --> 01:12:17.750]  Pedro, it looks like you have a small kind blowout there on the right hand side.
[01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:19.510]  You see the little darker streak?
[01:12:19.510 --> 01:12:20.510]  Oh yeah.
[01:12:20.510 --> 01:12:24.950]  So some of the material that's been inside of your bag inside there has come out.
[01:12:24.950 --> 01:12:27.790]  I didn't get to see because I was trying to get back on here.
[01:12:27.790 --> 01:12:28.790]  Oh yeah.
[01:12:28.790 --> 01:12:32.030]  What your bag setup was, I generally do a double bag.
[01:12:32.030 --> 01:12:37.950]  So I'll put the hash inside of a 37U, and then I'll put that 37U inside of a 120U.
[01:12:37.950 --> 01:12:39.430]  And we call that the bulletproof tech.
[01:12:39.430 --> 01:12:42.750]  And that will generally prevent the blowouts.
[01:12:42.750 --> 01:12:43.750]  Excellent.
[01:12:43.750 --> 01:12:48.630]  All right, I'm going to take this out and I'm going to open this bag and see exactly
[01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:49.630]  what we did.
[01:12:49.630 --> 01:12:51.710]  We'll figure it out here in a second.
[01:12:51.710 --> 01:12:55.670]  But basically I'm not going to squeeze this anymore, obviously.
[01:12:55.670 --> 01:12:59.270]  There's really any pressure on those plates.
[01:12:59.270 --> 01:13:06.510]  But yeah, that's my little life press here, guys, in my little homemade cube slash grow
[01:13:06.510 --> 01:13:10.110]  room slash dry room slash washroom.
[01:13:10.470 --> 01:13:13.310]  It's been an honor being here, guys.
[01:13:13.310 --> 01:13:14.310]  I mean, seriously.
[01:13:14.310 --> 01:13:15.390]  It looks great.
[01:13:15.390 --> 01:13:22.070]  I feel like this is the hash version of Top Chef.
[01:13:22.070 --> 01:13:24.870]  Or what's the Iron Chef, right?
[01:13:24.870 --> 01:13:32.670]  Like where the judges are watching and they dub the Japanese, right?
[01:13:32.670 --> 01:13:37.350]  No pressure.
[01:13:37.350 --> 01:13:38.670]  I love the dub part, though.
[01:13:38.710 --> 01:13:39.710]  That's the best stuff, Peter.
[01:13:39.710 --> 01:13:40.710]  Oh, look at that.
[01:13:40.710 --> 01:13:50.070]  All right, so judge number two, Jillian, what are your thoughts?
[01:13:50.070 --> 01:13:51.070]  Looks good.
[01:13:51.070 --> 01:13:56.230]  I would suggest, I always like to give a little preheat to those before going full pressure
[01:13:56.230 --> 01:13:57.230]  on them.
[01:13:57.230 --> 01:14:02.270]  Flow it down a little and it definitely helps prevent some of those blowouts for you.
[01:14:02.270 --> 01:14:05.550]  So let's see exactly what happened here, guys, okay?
[01:14:05.550 --> 01:14:07.350]  So there's my bag.
[01:14:07.350 --> 01:14:08.350]  I've been old school.
[01:14:08.350 --> 01:14:09.350]  I always do the up and down stuff.
[01:14:09.350 --> 01:14:14.350]  I don't like to do the whole fold, but you can see here.
[01:14:14.350 --> 01:14:15.470]  Excuse me.
[01:14:15.470 --> 01:14:19.310]  There was no blowout, guys.
[01:14:19.310 --> 01:14:21.430]  That's not a blowout.
[01:14:21.430 --> 01:14:25.070]  That bag, it came off the seam for some reason.
[01:14:25.070 --> 01:14:26.070]  But I'll take it.
[01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:27.070]  I mean...
[01:14:27.070 --> 01:14:30.590]  Are the seams on the side?
[01:14:30.590 --> 01:14:35.830]  Yeah, it looks great, but you'll find little specks in that darker spot.
[01:14:35.830 --> 01:14:39.270]  And I think that she definitely hit it on the head there.
[01:14:39.270 --> 01:14:44.390]  You want to let it warm up a little bit more to get that liquid inside before pressing
[01:14:44.390 --> 01:14:48.630]  out and that'll create a little less pressure on that bag so that those larger particles
[01:14:48.630 --> 01:14:50.670]  won't make it through, yeah?
[01:14:50.670 --> 01:14:51.670]  Absolutely.
[01:14:51.670 --> 01:14:52.670]  Thank you for the advice.
[01:14:52.670 --> 01:14:54.390]  Yeah, but that looks great.
[01:14:54.390 --> 01:14:55.390]  I'd smoke it.
[01:14:55.390 --> 01:14:56.390]  Oh, for sure.
[01:14:56.390 --> 01:14:57.390]  You should smell it.
[01:14:57.390 --> 01:14:58.390]  And let's see.
[01:14:58.390 --> 01:14:59.390]  Go ahead, Pedro.
[01:15:00.390 --> 01:15:01.390]  Sorry.
[01:15:01.390 --> 01:15:13.550]  You can take that cube there and fold it in half again and give it a second press and
[01:15:13.550 --> 01:15:16.750]  you'll get some more out of it and it'll be a little different consistency than your first
[01:15:16.750 --> 01:15:17.750]  press.
[01:15:17.750 --> 01:15:21.110]  Yeah, but I'm trying to figure out.
[01:15:21.110 --> 01:15:22.950]  It looks like it came off the corner here.
[01:15:22.950 --> 01:15:23.950]  See that?
[01:15:23.950 --> 01:15:24.950]  Yeah.
[01:15:24.950 --> 01:15:31.710]  And you know, that could be too.
[01:15:31.710 --> 01:15:37.510]  If you get that little puck there, if it's just a little bit off the center so that that
[01:15:37.510 --> 01:15:41.750]  little corner or something doesn't have the pressure that the rest has on it, then that
[01:15:41.750 --> 01:15:44.750]  would be a place where you might have some stuff escape.
[01:15:44.750 --> 01:15:50.830]  So making sure that that pad is the same size or smaller than your plates on there is important
[01:15:50.830 --> 01:15:51.830]  as well.
[01:15:51.830 --> 01:15:52.830]  What kind of press is that?
[01:15:52.830 --> 01:15:53.830]  It's just a Harbor Freight.
[01:15:53.830 --> 01:15:54.830]  I mean, honestly, I never have any problems.
[01:15:54.830 --> 01:15:55.830]  It's just that I'm on the spot with you guys and it just happened, you know?
[01:15:55.830 --> 01:16:03.790]  It's an old press.
[01:16:03.790 --> 01:16:05.850]  It's awesome.
[01:16:05.850 --> 01:16:06.850]  That's a beautiful press.
[01:16:06.850 --> 01:16:09.970]  Right next to my little freeze dryer.
[01:16:09.970 --> 01:16:11.630]  This is my little washroom.
[01:16:11.630 --> 01:16:12.630]  Flash everything.
[01:16:12.630 --> 01:16:16.410]  You got a pelagic sticker on there, man?
[01:16:16.410 --> 01:16:17.410]  That's thick.
[01:16:17.410 --> 01:16:18.410]  What was that?
[01:16:18.410 --> 01:16:21.870]  You've got a pelagic sticker.
[01:16:21.870 --> 01:16:23.570]  I am an avid fishermen.
[01:16:23.570 --> 01:16:28.930]  I, uh, I financed my fishing habits selling.
[01:16:29.030 --> 01:16:32.290]  No, no, I'm not going to say that, but yeah, my, my first
[01:16:32.290 --> 01:16:33.130]  time fishing.
[01:16:36.470 --> 01:16:36.970]  Oh yeah.
[01:16:37.770 --> 01:16:42.370]  So a couple behind me, I chased tuna.
[01:16:42.430 --> 01:16:43.850]  Uh, I've been chasing tuna.
[01:16:43.850 --> 01:16:46.350]  I grew up South of Port of a yard on a little town called
[01:16:46.350 --> 01:16:48.970]  Milwaukee, uh, back in the nineties.
[01:16:49.010 --> 01:16:51.850]  Um, it was great fishing right off the shore.
[01:16:51.890 --> 01:16:55.050]  I got lucky enough that my parents bought a Palapa right on the beach.
[01:16:56.050 --> 01:16:57.690]  I lifestyle down there.
[01:16:57.690 --> 01:17:04.050]  And, um, we, we went down to, uh, this back in, you know, um, 93, 94,
[01:17:04.050 --> 01:17:05.410]  we got there in 80 something.
[01:17:05.890 --> 01:17:09.210]  And when I was a kid, I was just that one guy that didn't like that
[01:17:09.250 --> 01:17:11.090]  bond that music and I was a surfer.
[01:17:12.030 --> 01:17:15.570]  And, you know, we got exposed to a lot of places in mutual kind of
[01:17:15.570 --> 01:17:19.650]  fun, the Sierra's cause you know, and you know, we did a lot of
[01:17:19.650 --> 01:17:24.130]  char us and hash has been my passion for ever and lucky.
[01:17:24.130 --> 01:17:27.210]  I'm so lucky to be here on this panel with you guys.
[01:17:27.210 --> 01:17:28.810]  And thank you for the opportunity to Peter.
[01:17:29.330 --> 01:17:30.750]  I sincerely appreciate it.
[01:17:30.810 --> 01:17:32.730]  It's truly an honor.
[01:17:32.810 --> 01:17:33.310]  Thank you.
[01:17:33.970 --> 01:17:34.650]  No problem.
[01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:38.210]  And we're cutting to, this is like the live action.
[01:17:38.210 --> 01:17:38.810]  We got.
[01:17:39.290 --> 01:17:40.430]  Rise and evolution.
[01:17:40.430 --> 01:17:42.450]  What do you, what are you doing right now?
[01:17:42.850 --> 01:17:46.850]  I'm just mixing up, breaking this up, getting it ready for the banger.
[01:17:47.130 --> 01:17:49.370]  It's a, some slurricane.
[01:17:50.290 --> 01:17:53.330]  I'm one of my buddies here locally and Sandy did it.
[01:17:56.290 --> 01:17:58.970]  Well, I think speaking of,
[01:18:00.970 --> 01:18:06.570]  um, I think some people know what's coming.
[01:18:08.410 --> 01:18:08.910]  Whoa.
[01:18:09.170 --> 01:18:10.490]  I think my phone just died.
[01:18:10.610 --> 01:18:11.210]  Nevermind.
[01:18:12.490 --> 01:18:13.370]  Well, that's great.
[01:18:17.890 --> 01:18:18.390]  Yeah.
[01:18:18.410 --> 01:18:20.330]  Craig, Craig knows what I was going to cut to.
[01:18:20.330 --> 01:18:21.290]  And then my phone died.
[01:18:27.970 --> 01:18:30.810]  What's everybody dabbing on today or tonight?
[01:18:32.570 --> 01:18:34.610]  I'll be dabbing on the stupid fruits here in a second.
[01:18:39.410 --> 01:18:42.090]  I'm hitting some, uh, Santa Cruz, pink lemonade.
[01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:55.620]  Got some awesome garlic juice from a South face farms going today.
[01:19:01.030 --> 01:19:01.530]  Okay.
[01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:04.990]  I want to ask Tina, what, what are some of your, your favorite farms that you
[01:19:04.990 --> 01:19:08.190]  guys have been, um, been washing for this, this year?
[01:19:11.990 --> 01:19:12.950]  Jillian.
[01:19:13.830 --> 01:19:14.390]  I'm sorry.
[01:19:15.070 --> 01:19:15.830]  No, that's all right.
[01:19:15.830 --> 01:19:17.390]  Our, uh, sorcerer's Tiana.
[01:19:17.950 --> 01:19:23.070]  Um, we've been, you know, crushing it with new farms this year, but we've got,
[01:19:23.150 --> 01:19:26.310]  um, some amazing ones that we're working with.
[01:19:26.350 --> 01:19:31.150]  We've got South face farms with Mac who is rocking it, washed some
[01:19:31.150 --> 01:19:33.350]  big washes of garlic juice today.
[01:19:34.110 --> 01:19:36.550]  Um, also working with Shauna ABR.
[01:19:36.950 --> 01:19:37.870]  Really exciting.
[01:19:37.870 --> 01:19:43.390]  He's known for being an incredible Roslyn farmer and really excited.
[01:19:43.390 --> 01:19:50.070]  We're actually the first, um, legal market company that he's worked with.
[01:19:50.430 --> 01:19:55.430]  And of course we always have our standbys humble kind, Emerald queen.
[01:19:55.950 --> 01:20:01.590]  Got some really great stuff coming from saber tooth, Redwood Valley, lots of
[01:20:01.750 --> 01:20:03.790]  new, good flavors coming out this season.
[01:20:04.230 --> 01:20:04.950]  That's awesome.
[01:20:04.990 --> 01:20:09.230]  I got to, I got to sample some of the, um, the work you guys did for my
[01:20:09.230 --> 01:20:10.550]  llama, the roots last year.
[01:20:11.070 --> 01:20:13.390]  And that was really great material.
[01:20:13.710 --> 01:20:18.510]  Um, can you, can you tell us about your processing lab and, and, um, you know,
[01:20:18.510 --> 01:20:20.510]  like, I don't know, tell us about it.
[01:20:20.510 --> 01:20:23.870]  I have no idea what you guys are doing down there, how big your production is,
[01:20:24.510 --> 01:20:26.910]  are you guys outsourcing everything, doing stuff in-house?
[01:20:27.470 --> 01:20:29.870]  Um, no, we don't outsource anything.
[01:20:29.910 --> 01:20:32.230]  We do everything in-house by hand.
[01:20:32.830 --> 01:20:37.750]  Um, this whole year we've had just a team of myself and five people.
[01:20:38.510 --> 01:20:43.190]  And we are just in the last couple of weeks, growing the team,
[01:20:43.310 --> 01:20:45.230]  hiring, training, some new people.
[01:20:45.790 --> 01:20:51.070]  We're also expanding our production space to more than double the size.
[01:20:51.830 --> 01:20:56.630]  But everything we do is hand washing about 30,000 grams a day.
[01:20:57.590 --> 01:21:04.270]  And then, you know, small presses, hand cramming, everything is just small batch.
[01:21:05.070 --> 01:21:06.550]  Slow and meticulous.
[01:21:06.910 --> 01:21:12.910]  But it's, uh, we're finally taking a breath and looking at actually doing some
[01:21:13.030 --> 01:21:14.870]  marketing and a little more social media.
[01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:19.230]  Up till now, we've just kind of been doing our thing and keeping quiet about it.
[01:21:19.350 --> 01:21:22.750]  But, um, nice to see it getting somewhere.
[01:21:23.630 --> 01:21:23.790]  Yeah.
[01:21:23.790 --> 01:21:25.950]  Well, we see you guys doing really good work out there.
[01:21:25.950 --> 01:21:29.710]  So, so big ups and yeah, there's nothing wrong when you're, when you're in there.
[01:21:30.190 --> 01:21:32.990]  I've been in the cold room for about seven weeks straight.
[01:21:33.030 --> 01:21:33.870]  My bones ache.
[01:21:33.950 --> 01:21:35.110]  I'm ready for a vacation.
[01:21:35.110 --> 01:21:40.190]  But, um, when it's this time of the year and you're processing stuff, it's, it's
[01:21:40.190 --> 01:21:43.950]  go time, you know, and, um, it's a lot of work.
[01:21:43.950 --> 01:21:44.670]  It doesn't stop.
[01:21:45.350 --> 01:21:48.910]  No, we've been doing 10 to 12 hour days for the last three months.
[01:21:49.510 --> 01:21:56.430]  Trying to manage production and processing through all of the new, you know, strains,
[01:21:56.430 --> 01:21:58.430]  all the test washes, all of that.
[01:21:58.590 --> 01:21:59.750]  Plus construction.
[01:21:59.910 --> 01:22:05.110]  Um, it's a handful, a lot of weekends, a lot of light, late nights like tonight,
[01:22:05.670 --> 01:22:10.430]  but it's going to be worth it next year when we're all rocking and rolling.
[01:22:10.430 --> 01:22:12.590]  And, uh, we've got some great shit coming out.
[01:22:12.590 --> 01:22:13.470]  I'm really excited.
[01:22:14.190 --> 01:22:14.510]  Right on.
[01:22:14.510 --> 01:22:17.790]  Well, big ups for you guys bringing awesome solvent list to the, uh, the
[01:22:17.790 --> 01:22:20.510]  California marketplace and any more of that.
[01:22:20.510 --> 01:22:28.150]  So just quickly in the chat, there was, uh, some conversation about slur.
[01:22:28.150 --> 01:22:28.510]  Whoa.
[01:22:28.590 --> 01:22:29.630]  I just blew Pat.
[01:22:29.710 --> 01:22:30.750]  Give me one second.
[01:22:30.750 --> 01:22:31.150]  All right.
[01:22:33.110 --> 01:22:35.950]  So Craig, uh, posted this.
[01:22:39.710 --> 01:22:41.590]  Craig growing fire.
[01:22:42.230 --> 01:22:42.990]  Oh yeah.
[01:22:43.430 --> 01:22:45.270]  Can't wait to get my hands on them.
[01:22:45.950 --> 01:22:53.990]  Hey Peter is, uh, I cannot see, but is, uh, is Josh still on with us?
[01:22:54.670 --> 01:22:55.710]  Josh is Josh.
[01:22:55.710 --> 01:22:56.870]  You want to play a song?
[01:22:58.510 --> 01:23:02.030]  Hey, Hey, I just, I just wanted to say one more time, you know, how awesome
[01:23:02.030 --> 01:23:04.870]  Josh Heinrichs is, and I don't know if you guys are still doing the dedications,
[01:23:04.870 --> 01:23:09.510]  Josh, um, but Josh does a really neat service where if you, if you want a
[01:23:09.510 --> 01:23:13.070]  special dedication, he'll make a personalized message and sing a song
[01:23:13.390 --> 01:23:14.510]  and send that out for you.
[01:23:14.510 --> 01:23:16.070]  And it's a really, really cool gift.
[01:23:16.070 --> 01:23:17.790]  A good way to support an artist.
[01:23:17.790 --> 01:23:20.550]  Um, so if you're interested in that and he does some really cool, uh,
[01:23:20.590 --> 01:23:25.990]  baseball cards, um, we're a fan of, so, uh, reach out there and get in touch
[01:23:25.990 --> 01:23:27.710]  with Josh Heinrichs, if you guys are interested.
[01:23:28.670 --> 01:23:31.950]  Well, how about can, can, can you do one?
[01:23:31.990 --> 01:23:33.430]  Can you do one for Jillian?
[01:23:38.470 --> 01:23:40.830]  As the one lady on the show.
[01:23:41.590 --> 01:23:43.310]  All right, Jillian, this one's for you.
[01:23:44.750 --> 01:23:45.550]  This goes out to you.
[01:23:48.510 --> 01:23:51.030]  Whoa.

[01:26:00.460 --> 01:26:03.460]  said morning, no night, night
[01:26:03.460 --> 01:26:07.460]  said oh, oops
[01:26:07.460 --> 01:26:10.460]  man, it feels so nice
[01:26:10.460 --> 01:26:13.460]  we love to fuck, oh, oops
[01:26:13.460 --> 01:26:17.460]  said morning, no night, night

[01:26:37.790 --> 01:26:40.790]  yeah, yeah
[01:26:40.790 --> 01:26:44.790]  yeah, was that right, Jillian?
[01:26:44.790 --> 01:26:45.790]  yeah
[01:26:45.790 --> 01:26:48.790]  whoo!
[01:26:48.790 --> 01:26:53.790]  quite the way to be on a first YouTube video ever
[01:26:53.790 --> 01:26:56.790]  in fact, I had to make an account to get on here
[01:26:56.790 --> 01:26:58.790]  nice
[01:26:58.790 --> 01:27:01.790]  oh, thanks for the wonderful welcome
[01:27:01.790 --> 01:27:04.790]  hell yeah
[01:27:04.790 --> 01:27:07.790]  so, Pedro, uh
[01:27:07.790 --> 01:27:12.790]  someone remembered that you have a three-string, right?
[01:27:12.790 --> 01:27:15.790]  uh, yes, I do
[01:27:15.790 --> 01:27:18.790]  actually, I have a five-string, I have a five
[01:27:18.790 --> 01:27:21.790]  you muted me earlier, am I back on?
[01:27:21.790 --> 01:27:23.790]  can you hear me?
[01:27:23.790 --> 01:27:25.790]  you are
[01:27:25.790 --> 01:27:26.790]  yes, we can
[01:27:26.790 --> 01:27:28.790]  okay, good, I'm sorry
[01:27:28.790 --> 01:27:31.790]  I have a five-string guitar
[01:27:31.790 --> 01:27:34.790]  it's a homemade stick
[01:27:34.790 --> 01:27:36.790]  it's just my little hobby
[01:27:36.790 --> 01:27:39.790]  nothing special, to be honest
[01:27:39.790 --> 01:27:42.790]  but it works for me, it's just a slide open G
[01:27:42.790 --> 01:27:45.790]  don't know how to play a normal guitar
[01:27:45.790 --> 01:27:49.790]  is it close by?
[01:27:49.790 --> 01:27:52.790]  if you give me a minute, I might go get it
[01:27:52.790 --> 01:27:56.790]  yeah, let's go get it, remember, this is public assets television
[01:27:56.790 --> 01:28:00.790]  this is not the Tonight Show
[01:28:00.790 --> 01:28:04.790]  the audience expectations are low
[01:28:04.790 --> 01:28:07.790]  I'm always up for a good time
[01:28:07.790 --> 01:28:09.790]  if this is a good time, let's do it
[01:28:09.790 --> 01:28:11.790]  I'll be right back, give me a second
[01:28:11.790 --> 01:28:17.790]  so, you know, Joseph was talking about the underground scene and community
[01:28:17.790 --> 01:28:21.790]  and being able to sit with folks in Bern and the clubs in Barcelona and stuff
[01:28:22.790 --> 01:28:27.790]  there's a really great video out there, Josh Heinrichs and I put out a couple years back
[01:28:27.790 --> 01:28:31.790]  from an underground event where we rented a place and kind of had an open hash bar
[01:28:31.790 --> 01:28:37.790]  and so if you go on YouTube, Josh Heinrichs' One Love video, you can check it out
[01:28:37.790 --> 01:28:41.790]  and Josh has done all kinds of events with us
[01:28:41.790 --> 01:28:45.790]  we used to do the Pacific Northwest Roots Fest up here in Washington
[01:28:45.790 --> 01:28:49.790]  and he came and headlined a few times along with Clinton Fearon
[01:28:49.790 --> 01:28:55.790]  and Roots Arise and a whole bunch of reggae artists that have come through
[01:28:55.790 --> 01:29:03.790]  and the underground, I think it was alive more so pre-legalization here in Washington
[01:29:03.790 --> 01:29:07.790]  in the medical scene, there was more gatherings, more social kind of stuff
[01:29:07.790 --> 01:29:11.790]  so maybe we'll see that in the future, maybe we'll see, hopefully we can push for
[01:29:11.790 --> 01:29:16.790]  a relaxing of these kind of crazy rules about how we gather, where we can smoke
[01:29:17.790 --> 01:29:21.790]  Portland's got some cool clubs that let people socialize
[01:29:21.790 --> 01:29:24.790]  so maybe California will get there, hopefully Washington will get there soon
[01:29:24.790 --> 01:29:28.790]  and maybe even Missouri one day, Missouri just got medical, yeah Josh?
[01:29:31.790 --> 01:29:37.790]  Yeah, yeah we just sure did, I saw that Madison, Wisconsin just passed today
[01:29:37.790 --> 01:29:41.790]  that you can smoke anywhere, that you can smoke cigarettes, you can smoke marijuana
[01:29:42.790 --> 01:29:47.790]  outside in public, so that's pretty progressive, huh?
[01:29:47.790 --> 01:29:53.790]  Yeah, yeah why not right? Jeez Louise, I always tell people you don't have to smoke cigarettes anymore
[01:29:53.790 --> 01:29:55.790]  weed's legal, so like
[01:29:57.790 --> 01:30:02.790]  But you know not even California or anybody else has that kind of progressive of a law
[01:30:02.790 --> 01:30:06.790]  where you can just smoke out in public anywhere that cigarettes are permitted
[01:30:06.790 --> 01:30:10.790]  weed is permitted in Madison, Wisconsin now, so that's pretty rad
[01:30:10.790 --> 01:30:14.790]  Yeah that's kind of trailblazing, I know here in Washington you can't do that
[01:30:14.790 --> 01:30:17.790]  it's a small fine, you know you're not going to get arrested or anything
[01:30:17.790 --> 01:30:19.790]  but yeah they're not cool with it so
[01:30:24.790 --> 01:30:27.790]  That's, that'll be the day won't it?
[01:30:30.790 --> 01:30:32.790]  Yeah California needs to step it up
[01:30:32.790 --> 01:30:34.790]  Yeah, I gotta take this back from you
[01:30:34.790 --> 01:30:38.790]  Alright so Pedro, you ready to smoke that guitar?
[01:30:38.790 --> 01:30:42.790]  Hold on a minute, I haven't got, let me get my
[01:30:44.790 --> 01:30:47.790]  A little howling wolf
[01:30:48.790 --> 01:30:50.790]  It's just that
[01:30:51.790 --> 01:30:54.790]  It's got five pegs, one fanner
[01:30:55.790 --> 01:30:57.790]  and this is a hand-dogger pin
[01:30:57.790 --> 01:31:00.790]  and the story behind the guitar is that
[01:31:00.790 --> 01:31:04.790]  and the story behind the guitar is this dude from Enoggle Park
[01:31:04.790 --> 01:31:07.790]  was, he put his guitar on top of the car and drove away
[01:31:07.790 --> 01:31:10.790]  and the car had the band under the story
[01:31:10.790 --> 01:31:12.790]  so I picked it up
[01:31:43.580 --> 01:31:46.580]  I didn't pick up this guitar in a year bro
[01:31:46.580 --> 01:31:49.580]  and it still held tune on open G
[01:31:49.580 --> 01:31:52.580]  and this is just a stick and that's a couple of bowls
[01:31:52.580 --> 01:31:54.580]  and we have fun with it, it's just what it is
[01:32:21.620 --> 01:32:23.620]  Yeah buddy
[01:32:23.620 --> 01:32:27.620]  So this right here is basically a one inch liquid oxygen foot
[01:32:27.620 --> 01:32:29.620]  that we got from Rocket Dime
[01:32:29.620 --> 01:32:32.620]  in Santa Mountain when I built this guitar
[01:32:32.620 --> 01:32:34.620]  and it's basically just, it was a sign
[01:32:34.620 --> 01:32:36.620]  that said do not enter
[01:32:36.620 --> 01:32:39.620]  and I put a pickup on it and we electrified this thing
[01:32:40.620 --> 01:32:42.620]  It's a cool little stoner little gadget man
[01:32:44.620 --> 01:32:45.620]  That's awesome
[01:32:45.620 --> 01:32:49.620]  So how, can you go like super old school
[01:32:49.620 --> 01:32:52.620]  Can you do like some Robert Johnson, Sun House
[01:32:54.620 --> 01:32:57.620]  How far back can you go? Elmore James
[01:32:58.620 --> 01:32:59.620]  No sir
[01:32:59.620 --> 01:33:02.620]  Luther Guitar Jr. Johnson
[01:33:04.620 --> 01:33:07.620]  I can't go way back and pick like Robert Johnson ever did
[01:33:07.620 --> 01:33:09.620]  This thing is fretless
[01:33:10.620 --> 01:33:13.620]  I used, these are thumb packs
[01:33:13.620 --> 01:33:15.620]  just kind of mark my spots
[01:33:15.620 --> 01:33:18.620]  This is the one, the three, the five, seven
[01:33:19.620 --> 01:33:21.620]  and you know it's just
[01:33:36.430 --> 01:33:37.430]  It's funny
[01:33:37.430 --> 01:33:39.430]  I can't believe I'm doing this on live with you guys
[01:33:39.430 --> 01:33:40.430]  It's funny
[01:33:41.430 --> 01:33:46.430]  Yeah we can meander in any direction we feel like
[01:33:46.430 --> 01:33:48.430]  This is public access so
[01:33:49.430 --> 01:33:50.430]  Funny
[01:33:50.430 --> 01:33:52.430]  Let me electrify this thing, watch
[01:33:52.430 --> 01:33:53.430]  Guitars
[01:33:53.430 --> 01:33:55.430]  Let me electrify this thing
[01:33:55.430 --> 01:33:58.430]  I got this little mini deluxe
[01:33:59.430 --> 01:34:02.430]  Man if I was that one crazy dude that ever go jobless
[01:34:02.430 --> 01:34:05.430]  I can sit on the side of the freeway and always make money
[01:34:06.430 --> 01:34:07.430]  That's for sure
[01:34:07.430 --> 01:34:09.430]  Check it out, watch
[01:34:11.430 --> 01:34:13.430]  Oh we electrified now bro
[01:34:15.430 --> 01:34:18.430]  Let Jimmy, move over Rover, let Jimmy take over
[01:34:58.050 --> 01:35:00.050]  Yeah that's what I'm talking about
[01:35:03.050 --> 01:35:04.050]  That's awesome
[01:35:04.050 --> 01:35:05.050]  Yeah buddy
[01:35:06.050 --> 01:35:07.050]  Lazy
[01:35:07.050 --> 01:35:08.050]  Thanks man
[01:35:09.050 --> 01:35:10.050]  Keeps me sane
[01:35:10.050 --> 01:35:11.050]  Yeah
[01:35:13.050 --> 01:35:14.050]  No bad ass
[01:35:14.050 --> 01:35:15.050]  KJ said bad ass
[01:35:18.050 --> 01:35:19.050]  You said you made that?
[01:35:23.050 --> 01:35:25.050]  KJ you made that
[01:35:25.050 --> 01:35:29.050]  Yes I did, I made that from scratch bro
[01:35:29.050 --> 01:35:30.050]  Wow
[01:35:30.050 --> 01:35:31.050]  You want to hear the story?
[01:35:31.050 --> 01:35:32.050]  That's awesome
[01:35:34.050 --> 01:35:36.050]  This is an aluminum plate
[01:35:37.050 --> 01:35:38.050]  The pickup is right here
[01:35:38.050 --> 01:35:40.050]  This is how the broomstick
[01:35:40.050 --> 01:35:43.050]  That I saw to make the five string inlays
[01:35:43.050 --> 01:35:46.050]  And I drilled the five strings right here
[01:35:47.050 --> 01:35:49.050]  The string holders are at the back
[01:35:49.050 --> 01:35:53.050]  And the trick for this guitar to make it how the way it does
[01:35:53.050 --> 01:35:56.050]  Is I had to float the metal
[01:35:56.050 --> 01:35:57.050]  I don't know if you can see the gap
[01:35:58.050 --> 01:35:59.050]  Yeah
[01:35:59.050 --> 01:36:00.050]  You see the gap?
[01:36:00.050 --> 01:36:01.050]  Yeah
[01:36:01.050 --> 01:36:04.050]  I had to float the metal so this metal will vibrate
[01:36:04.050 --> 01:36:05.050]  When I hit it
[01:36:06.050 --> 01:36:08.050]  And that's basically what it was man
[01:36:08.050 --> 01:36:12.050]  I used to be working for NASA in the Department of Energy
[01:36:12.050 --> 01:36:13.050]  I'm a professional
[01:36:13.050 --> 01:36:15.050]  But we ain't doing shit
[01:36:20.050 --> 01:36:22.050]  Dude that's rad
[01:36:22.050 --> 01:36:23.050]  Yeah
[01:36:23.050 --> 01:36:26.050]  So I built this on our time
[01:36:28.050 --> 01:36:29.050]  That's cool
[01:36:30.050 --> 01:36:32.050]  Man you rock it bro
[01:36:34.050 --> 01:36:35.050]  Crushing
[01:36:35.050 --> 01:36:39.050]  And this is the same strap that was on the guitar that fell off bro
[01:36:39.050 --> 01:36:40.050]  Wow
[01:36:41.050 --> 01:36:42.050]  Sup Scatty
[01:36:45.050 --> 01:36:46.050]  Sup man
[01:36:46.050 --> 01:36:47.050]  Yo that's mean
[01:36:47.050 --> 01:36:49.050]  Hey Peter, I'm sorry my friend
[01:36:49.050 --> 01:36:50.050]  But I've got to take out
[01:36:50.050 --> 01:36:52.050]  Josh thank you so much
[01:36:52.050 --> 01:36:53.050]  For coming on
[01:36:53.050 --> 01:36:55.050]  You are incredible
[01:36:56.050 --> 01:37:00.050]  We'll keep the public access going
[01:37:05.050 --> 01:37:06.050]  Thanks for leading the
[01:37:06.050 --> 01:37:10.050]  Yeah I guess Joe dropped out a while ago
[01:37:11.050 --> 01:37:13.050]  I don't even think he was like
[01:37:13.050 --> 01:37:15.050]  I don't think he's even said anything
[01:37:15.050 --> 01:37:17.050]  Like my baby's crying I'm out
[01:37:18.050 --> 01:37:20.050]  Appreciate it
[01:37:22.050 --> 01:37:24.050]  Maybe not next Thursday since it's Thanksgiving
[01:37:24.050 --> 01:37:28.050]  But hopefully we'll be back again the following Thursday
[01:37:29.050 --> 01:37:30.050]  We'll circle back
[01:37:30.050 --> 01:37:32.050]  Awesome Pedro thanks for sharing your stuff
[01:37:32.050 --> 01:37:34.050]  Big ups Papa Select
[01:37:34.050 --> 01:37:36.050]  And big up yourself Peter every time
[01:37:37.050 --> 01:37:38.050]  Thank you guys it's an honor
[01:37:38.050 --> 01:37:40.050]  See you guys
[01:37:42.050 --> 01:37:44.050]  Alright so
[01:37:45.050 --> 01:37:46.050]  What?
[01:37:46.050 --> 01:37:48.050]  Oh we just lost Josh too?
[01:37:48.050 --> 01:37:50.050]  Yeah he's like I'm out
[01:37:50.050 --> 01:37:52.050]  I'm gonna get out of here while I can
[01:37:55.050 --> 01:37:58.050]  So Jillian you live up
[01:37:58.050 --> 01:38:00.050]  Oh and I didn't even notice we lost
[01:38:00.050 --> 01:38:02.050]  Roz and Evolution too but
[01:38:03.050 --> 01:38:04.050]  You
[01:38:04.050 --> 01:38:06.050]  Oh and we still have Kaya
[01:38:06.050 --> 01:38:08.050]  Alright Kaya is
[01:38:08.050 --> 01:38:09.050]  There we go
[01:38:09.050 --> 01:38:10.050]  So
[01:38:12.050 --> 01:38:13.050]  Are you guys
[01:38:13.050 --> 01:38:17.050]  You guys are working with like all sorts of different farms up in NorCal?
[01:38:19.050 --> 01:38:21.050]  Yeah we do
[01:38:21.050 --> 01:38:23.050]  We're right in the heart of Humboldt
[01:38:23.050 --> 01:38:24.050]  And
[01:38:25.050 --> 01:38:26.050]  We
[01:38:26.050 --> 01:38:28.050]  You know so many of us have seen and lost
[01:38:28.050 --> 01:38:30.050]  So many good farmers
[01:38:30.050 --> 01:38:31.050]  Good partners
[01:38:31.050 --> 01:38:32.050]  Good genetics
[01:38:32.050 --> 01:38:34.050]  Through the transition years
[01:38:35.050 --> 01:38:39.050]  And so we work with as many small farms as we can
[01:38:39.050 --> 01:38:42.050]  And it's about you know kind of supporting our community
[01:38:42.050 --> 01:38:46.050]  And trying to kind of preserve the traditions
[01:38:46.050 --> 01:38:49.050]  Nobody wants to lose out to
[01:38:49.050 --> 01:38:52.050]  You know just giant massive growth
[01:38:52.050 --> 01:38:56.050]  Yes Arty Pop and Collect is part of Pop and Barclay Company
[01:38:58.050 --> 01:38:59.050]  And that's where the name came from
[01:38:59.050 --> 01:39:01.050]  Beautiful
[01:39:01.050 --> 01:39:03.050]  Should we bring Guy on?
[01:39:03.050 --> 01:39:05.050]  Should we see if he's awake right now?
[01:39:05.050 --> 01:39:06.050]  He would love
[01:39:06.050 --> 01:39:08.050]  He would love to join
[01:39:08.050 --> 01:39:10.050]  I don't know if he's up or not but
[01:39:10.050 --> 01:39:12.050]  Alright let me text him but
[01:39:12.050 --> 01:39:13.050]  Well
[01:39:13.050 --> 01:39:14.050]  So I mean
[01:39:14.050 --> 01:39:17.050]  As a satisfying job role
[01:39:17.050 --> 01:39:19.050]  You basically get to like
[01:39:19.050 --> 01:39:21.050]  Meet lots of different farms
[01:39:21.050 --> 01:39:24.050]  And be like I'd like to wash your flour
[01:39:24.050 --> 01:39:25.050]  Or your trim
[01:39:25.050 --> 01:39:27.050]  And turn it into
[01:39:27.050 --> 01:39:29.050]  Amazing hash
[01:39:29.050 --> 01:39:31.050]  Yeah no trim
[01:39:31.050 --> 01:39:33.050]  Just whole plant fresh frozen for us
[01:39:33.050 --> 01:39:34.050]  But
[01:39:34.050 --> 01:39:36.050]  Yeah it is really exciting
[01:39:36.050 --> 01:39:39.050]  We have the best can of procurement team around
[01:39:39.050 --> 01:39:40.050]  And
[01:39:40.050 --> 01:39:41.050]  They do all the
[01:39:41.050 --> 01:39:42.050]  Hard leg work
[01:39:42.050 --> 01:39:43.050]  Finding the strains
[01:39:43.050 --> 01:39:44.050]  Finding the farms
[01:39:44.050 --> 01:39:46.050]  But when it comes down to it
[01:39:46.050 --> 01:39:48.050]  It's really great to go out in the season
[01:39:49.050 --> 01:39:51.050]  Pick out just the best of the best
[01:39:51.050 --> 01:39:52.050]  And
[01:39:52.050 --> 01:39:54.050]  Make it happen for everybody but
[01:39:54.050 --> 01:39:56.050]  It's really interesting to
[01:39:56.050 --> 01:39:58.050]  Take the same strain, the same genetics
[01:39:58.050 --> 01:40:00.050]  And see the way it's grown by different farmers
[01:40:00.050 --> 01:40:02.050]  And different microclimates
[01:40:02.050 --> 01:40:05.050]  And have a chance to
[01:40:05.050 --> 01:40:07.050]  You know really just find
[01:40:07.050 --> 01:40:11.050]  That combination that just allows the genetics to perform
[01:40:11.050 --> 01:40:12.050]  Some
[01:40:12.050 --> 01:40:13.050]  Like the
[01:40:13.050 --> 01:40:15.050]  Cold damp coastal nights
[01:40:15.050 --> 01:40:18.050]  Some really thrive in that super hot heat
[01:40:18.050 --> 01:40:19.050]  And
[01:40:19.050 --> 01:40:22.050]  You know we get to serve everything the best of the emerald triangle
[01:40:22.050 --> 01:40:25.050]  And then put it out to the public and
[01:40:25.050 --> 01:40:28.050]  You know we try to rep our farmers too as much as we can
[01:40:28.050 --> 01:40:30.050]  Because that's
[01:40:30.050 --> 01:40:32.050]  Obviously step one
[01:40:32.050 --> 01:40:34.050]  Without our farmers we couldn't make shit
[01:40:34.050 --> 01:40:37.050]  So it's a really exciting job
[01:40:37.050 --> 01:40:38.050]  It's
[01:40:38.050 --> 01:40:39.050]  You know
[01:40:39.050 --> 01:40:41.050]  Takes a lot of time, a lot of hard work
[01:40:41.050 --> 01:40:42.050]  But it's
[01:40:42.050 --> 01:40:44.050]  It's been a great fucking ride
[01:40:45.050 --> 01:40:48.050]  And what was
[01:40:48.050 --> 01:40:51.050]  Like this season some of the
[01:40:51.050 --> 01:40:55.050]  What were you most excited when you got your hands on it?
[01:40:55.050 --> 01:40:57.050]  Ooh
[01:40:57.050 --> 01:41:00.050]  That's like what's your favorite child? I mean
[01:41:00.050 --> 01:41:06.320]  You know I've got some great ones that I haven't had a chance to run
[01:41:06.320 --> 01:41:10.320]  Sabertooth knocked it out of the park with the fat so
[01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:14.320]  Again it's fresh on my mind, fresh in my hands
[01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:18.320]  But that garlic juice from Mac is unreal
[01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:23.320]  Eric with the old kind is always killing me with the best of the best
[01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:25.320]  And the newest of the new
[01:41:25.320 --> 01:41:28.320]  But god to pick one
[01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:30.320]  Ooh
[01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:33.320]  That's tough I still got some new ones to get through yet
[01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:37.320]  Gotta go with that garlic juice today though
[01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:39.320]  I've been washing it the last two days
[01:41:39.320 --> 01:41:40.320]  Just the
[01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:43.320]  Gassiest, strongest
[01:41:43.320 --> 01:41:46.320]  GMO pie across I've ever come across
[01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:50.320]  Yeah I'm
[01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:54.320]  I texted Sabertooth to see if
[01:41:54.320 --> 01:41:58.320]  And then I texted Guy to see if he wants to jump on too
[01:41:58.320 --> 01:42:00.320]  And oh yes Alpenglow
[01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:01.320]  We love you
[01:42:01.320 --> 01:42:02.320]  Tar Hill
[01:42:02.320 --> 01:42:03.320]  Kills it every year
[01:42:03.320 --> 01:42:06.320]  That GMB is unmatched
[01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:08.320]  Nice
[01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:10.320]  Greg is always putting fire over there man
[01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:12.320]  Oh yeah
[01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:13.320]  Yeah he truly is
[01:42:13.320 --> 01:42:14.320]  Living soil
[01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:18.320]  I mean I've been in touch with Greg
[01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:20.320]  You know through
[01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:22.320]  Online stuff and
[01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:23.320]  I mean
[01:42:23.320 --> 01:42:27.320]  Truly an honor to even get to be able to ask a question from this gentleman
[01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:28.320]  To be honest with you
[01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:32.320]  And he's very very helpful whenever I have
[01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:35.320]  Any doubt or any question like that he's really helpful
[01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:37.320]  He's putting on the fire over there
[01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:39.320]  Love what Greg is doing up there
[01:42:39.320 --> 01:42:40.320]  Nice job
[01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:42.320]  Including all the chickens
[01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:44.320]  Oh yeah so Greg wanted you to grab
[01:42:44.320 --> 01:42:46.320]  Can you grab a chicken and bring it
[01:42:46.320 --> 01:42:49.320]  You pulled the guitar on camera
[01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:50.320]  Okay
[01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:52.320]  Can you wake one of the sleeping chickens
[01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:55.320]  And be like sorry to annoy you but
[01:42:55.320 --> 01:42:56.320]  They'll think I'm a possum or something
[01:42:56.320 --> 01:42:58.320]  They'll beat the crap out of me
[01:42:58.320 --> 01:42:59.320]  Excuse my language
[01:42:59.320 --> 01:43:00.320]  And they're cooped up right now
[01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:03.320]  They're not getting their chickens right now
[01:43:03.320 --> 01:43:04.320]  Yeah
[01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:07.320]  So talk about what
[01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:11.320]  What pests in the garden do the chickens
[01:43:11.320 --> 01:43:13.320]  Most attack
[01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:15.320]  Like what are you just like fuck yeah
[01:43:15.320 --> 01:43:20.320]  Well I hardly release my chickens in the cultivar
[01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:24.320]  When the plants are there to be honest with you
[01:43:24.320 --> 01:43:25.320]  I let them go after
[01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:27.320]  And the reason why is because
[01:43:27.320 --> 01:43:29.320]  They eat all my worms man
[01:43:31.320 --> 01:43:33.320]  Excuse my language
[01:43:33.320 --> 01:43:34.320]  Fuckers
[01:43:34.320 --> 01:43:36.320]  And they start eating all my worms
[01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:38.320]  And I'm like seriously they will
[01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:40.320]  I mean chickens are hooligans
[01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:42.320]  I mean if Craig is here he'll know
[01:43:42.320 --> 01:43:45.320]  I mean they will tear your bed up
[01:43:45.320 --> 01:43:47.320]  And they'll find that honey hole
[01:43:47.320 --> 01:43:49.320]  And it's like they got low jack on worms
[01:43:49.320 --> 01:43:50.320]  To be honest with you
[01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:53.320]  They zone out exactly where they're at
[01:43:53.320 --> 01:43:55.320]  And next thing you know you're 50
[01:43:55.320 --> 01:43:58.320]  Negative 50 in a minute
[01:43:58.320 --> 01:44:01.320]  So I kind of watch them
[01:44:01.320 --> 01:44:05.320]  Most of the stuff that I do with the chickens
[01:44:05.320 --> 01:44:07.320]  I collect their poop and I compost it
[01:44:07.320 --> 01:44:09.320]  And that's the way I bring it around
[01:44:09.320 --> 01:44:12.320]  But I try to keep the chickens away from the cultivar
[01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:16.320]  But I do use them to like clean up weeds and stuff
[01:44:16.320 --> 01:44:20.320]  Like everybody knows that I made a couple little seeds
[01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:22.320]  All the stuff that I wash
[01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:26.320]  Obviously you couldn't get all the seeds out of my materials
[01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:28.320]  So I threw them out of my beds
[01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:30.320]  And they start sprouting out
[01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:32.320]  And of course I let the chickens out
[01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:34.320]  And they're having a good old time
[01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:37.320]  With those little small sprouts
[01:44:37.320 --> 01:44:39.320]  But yeah
[01:44:39.320 --> 01:44:42.320]  Love chickens, love to have all that stuff
[01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:44.320]  I'm getting a bunch of feathers too
[01:44:44.320 --> 01:44:46.320]  And I'm going to grind them up
[01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:48.320]  And make some K&F with it
[01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:50.320]  So yeah, good stuff
[01:44:50.320 --> 01:44:52.320]  And by the way Craig if you want to jump on
[01:44:52.320 --> 01:44:54.320]  I sent you the link
[01:44:54.320 --> 01:44:57.320]  But Jillian
[01:44:57.320 --> 01:45:00.320]  I'm very glad to hear it bro
[01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:05.320]  Yeah, Pedro is enthusiastic about you jumping on with us
[01:45:05.320 --> 01:45:07.320]  So Jillian
[01:45:07.320 --> 01:45:09.320]  What uh
[01:45:09.320 --> 01:45:13.320]  Tell me about the job interview with Guy
[01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:15.320]  And uh
[01:45:15.320 --> 01:45:17.320]  What is it Adam?
[01:45:17.320 --> 01:45:19.320]  And like
[01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:21.320]  And uh
[01:45:21.320 --> 01:45:23.320]  Top management
[01:45:23.320 --> 01:45:27.320]  To interview as the lead hash maker
[01:45:28.320 --> 01:45:32.320]  I actually met Guy a few years past
[01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:34.320]  At MJ BizCon
[01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:37.320]  My sister is in the cannabis marketing business
[01:45:37.320 --> 01:45:39.320]  I met him
[01:45:39.320 --> 01:45:42.320]  Through her, ran into him at an MJ BizCon or two
[01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:45.320]  We were talking on the phone
[01:45:45.320 --> 01:45:47.320]  Let's see
[01:45:47.320 --> 01:45:49.320]  December 2017 I guess
[01:45:49.320 --> 01:45:54.320]  And somehow got on the subject of my early days growing
[01:45:54.320 --> 01:45:56.320]  And making hash
[01:45:56.320 --> 01:45:58.320]  And he was like hey
[01:45:58.320 --> 01:46:00.320]  Pop and Barclays
[01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:02.320]  Did you always live up in NorCal?
[01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:04.320]  No actually I grew up in Arizona
[01:46:04.320 --> 01:46:08.320]  And then I moved to Mexico and lived there for about 10 years
[01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:10.320]  And then I came to NorCal
[01:46:10.320 --> 01:46:13.320]  Damn do we know anyone who knows Mexico?
[01:46:13.320 --> 01:46:15.320]  I grew up in Mexico man
[01:46:15.320 --> 01:46:17.320]  That was my area you know what I mean?
[01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:19.320]  Yeah what part?
[01:46:19.320 --> 01:46:21.320]  I grew up in Milake, south of Puerto Vallarta
[01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:23.320]  A little town
[01:46:23.320 --> 01:46:25.320]  If you take Carretera Alplana straight down to 200
[01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:28.320]  We're split in Alplan
[01:46:28.320 --> 01:46:29.320]  Right there is Milake
[01:46:29.320 --> 01:46:31.320]  Bahia de Navidad is the most popular place
[01:46:31.320 --> 01:46:33.320]  But yeah I grew up in the area
[01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:36.320]  I traveled down by bus down to Ticla Michoacan
[01:46:36.320 --> 01:46:38.320]  Next spot was my spot
[01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:39.320]  All the way to Oaxaca
[01:46:39.320 --> 01:46:41.320]  Anywhere there was waves we traveled
[01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:43.320]  What part of Mexico were you in?
[01:46:43.320 --> 01:46:46.320]  I was in Baja on the Pacific Ocean
[01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:48.320]  Little town, Todos Santos
[01:46:48.320 --> 01:46:49.320]  Almost at the bottom
[01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:51.320]  Nice nice I know Todos Santos
[01:46:51.320 --> 01:46:53.320]  Yeah
[01:46:53.320 --> 01:46:55.320]  I was there a long time
[01:46:55.320 --> 01:46:57.320]  Best fishing in the fucking world man
[01:46:57.320 --> 01:46:59.320]  Oh yeah Wahoo
[01:46:59.320 --> 01:47:01.320]  Mag Bay, love Mag Bay
[01:47:01.320 --> 01:47:05.320]  I had a 23 Baja Bay runner out there killing them
[01:47:05.320 --> 01:47:06.320]  Without me
[01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:07.320]  I mean we didn't kill them
[01:47:07.320 --> 01:47:08.320]  But we put them back
[01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:09.320]  But I mean it was just
[01:47:09.320 --> 01:47:11.320]  Wide open
[01:47:11.320 --> 01:47:13.320]  I mean people
[01:47:13.320 --> 01:47:16.320]  It's hard to explain the feeling that you get
[01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:18.320]  When you have a wide open marlin bite
[01:47:18.320 --> 01:47:21.320]  It's just impossible
[01:47:21.320 --> 01:47:23.320]  Get out there in the Miami Bank
[01:47:23.320 --> 01:47:25.320]  And they're just schooling like tuna
[01:47:25.320 --> 01:47:27.320]  It's just unreal
[01:47:27.320 --> 01:47:29.320]  Lit up, blow in the water
[01:47:29.320 --> 01:47:31.320]  So much fun yeah
[01:47:31.320 --> 01:47:33.320]  Growing up
[01:47:33.320 --> 01:47:35.320]  Was the meanest fish for me
[01:47:36.320 --> 01:47:38.320]  In Southern California
[01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:41.320]  2014, 2017
[01:47:41.320 --> 01:47:43.320]  The bluefin tuna showed up
[01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:45.320]  Every year they've been constant
[01:47:45.320 --> 01:47:48.320]  We've been catching 200 to 300 pound models here
[01:47:48.320 --> 01:47:49.320]  Right outside
[01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:50.320]  Outside about 6
[01:47:50.320 --> 01:47:51.320]  Not those big ones
[01:47:51.320 --> 01:47:53.320]  The big ones hang out at San Clemente Island
[01:47:53.320 --> 01:47:55.320]  But they're literally out here
[01:47:55.320 --> 01:47:56.320]  They are in our back
[01:47:56.320 --> 01:47:59.320]  I caught a 150 pound bluefin in June
[01:47:59.320 --> 01:48:01.320]  Yes
[01:48:01.320 --> 01:48:03.320]  It was so much fun
[01:48:03.320 --> 01:48:04.320]  Love it
[01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:05.320]  Yeah
[01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:06.320]  That's cool
[01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:08.320]  I'm a fisherman at heart
[01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:10.320]  I used to fish Dorado
[01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:12.320]  And rooster fish right off the shore
[01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:14.320]  In 1990's in Mexico
[01:48:14.320 --> 01:48:15.320]  I mean we were getting
[01:48:15.320 --> 01:48:17.320]  The waves would come up
[01:48:17.320 --> 01:48:20.320]  And wash the anchovy right on the beach
[01:48:20.320 --> 01:48:22.320]  We would get the small number one hook
[01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:24.320]  Cast it out with hand line back then
[01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:25.320]  Yeah
[01:48:25.320 --> 01:48:26.320]  And it was
[01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:27.320]  I saw a world record snook
[01:48:27.320 --> 01:48:29.320]  Brought out of the Pacific on a hand line
[01:48:29.320 --> 01:48:30.320]  Yeah
[01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:31.320]  It's amazing
[01:48:31.320 --> 01:48:33.320]  But I was just showing a couple people on my team
[01:48:33.320 --> 01:48:35.320]  Pictures of a rooster fish the other day
[01:48:35.320 --> 01:48:37.320]  I was telling some story about it
[01:48:37.320 --> 01:48:38.320]  And they're like
[01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:40.320]  What a rooster fish
[01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:42.320]  And if you haven't seen them look it up
[01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:44.320]  It's a pretty awesome fish
[01:48:44.320 --> 01:48:45.320]  So much fun though
[01:48:45.320 --> 01:48:47.320]  There's nothing like the rooster
[01:48:47.320 --> 01:48:49.320]  And the color of the mahi
[01:48:49.320 --> 01:48:53.320]  And the purple of the great goose
[01:48:53.320 --> 01:48:55.320]  And the sulfur when the electric blue
[01:48:55.320 --> 01:48:57.320]  When they come right next to you
[01:48:57.320 --> 01:48:59.320]  The gap that sword
[01:48:59.320 --> 01:49:01.320]  And they hit that electric blue
[01:49:01.320 --> 01:49:02.320]  It's almost
[01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:03.320]  It's crazy
[01:49:03.320 --> 01:49:05.320]  It's almost spiritual
[01:49:05.320 --> 01:49:07.320]  Love fishing
[01:49:07.320 --> 01:49:08.320]  It's so much fun
[01:49:08.320 --> 01:49:11.320]  I actually just had some yellowtail
[01:49:11.320 --> 01:49:13.320]  For dinner that caught down in San Diego
[01:49:13.320 --> 01:49:14.320]  Last month too
[01:49:14.320 --> 01:49:15.320]  Or a couple months ago
[01:49:15.320 --> 01:49:16.320]  Before harvest
[01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:18.320]  What do you do with your collars?
[01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:20.320]  Keep them
[01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:21.320]  Collars are the best
[01:49:21.320 --> 01:49:22.320]  I was going to say
[01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:23.320]  I'll give you my address
[01:49:23.320 --> 01:49:24.320]  Please send them my way
[01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:28.320]  I love smoke
[01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:29.320]  So Pedro
[01:49:29.320 --> 01:49:31.320]  A very important question
[01:49:31.320 --> 01:49:32.320]  Yes sir
[01:49:35.320 --> 01:49:37.320]  How was the smoke from the press?
[01:49:37.320 --> 01:49:39.320]  It was extremely energetic
[01:49:39.320 --> 01:49:40.320]  Is it high sativa?
[01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:41.320]  Yeah
[01:49:42.320 --> 01:49:44.320]  Nobody noticed
[01:49:44.320 --> 01:49:45.320]  Nobody noticed
[01:49:45.320 --> 01:49:46.320]  Oh my god
[01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:47.320]  It's really good
[01:49:47.320 --> 01:49:49.320]  It's really fruity
[01:49:49.320 --> 01:49:52.320]  It's really fruity
[01:49:52.320 --> 01:49:53.320]  That's all I can say
[01:49:53.320 --> 01:49:54.320]  Like they say
[01:49:54.320 --> 01:49:55.320]  Stupid fruits in the name
[01:49:55.320 --> 01:49:57.320]  It really is
[01:49:57.320 --> 01:50:00.320]  It has a little bit of citrus
[01:50:00.320 --> 01:50:01.320]  Egg-tail
[01:50:01.320 --> 01:50:03.320]  But it's all fruits
[01:50:03.320 --> 01:50:04.320]  Literally
[01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:05.320]  This 90
[01:50:05.320 --> 01:50:07.320]  The 73 was nice
[01:50:07.320 --> 01:50:09.320]  But this 90 was really really really nice
[01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:10.320]  To be honest with you
[01:50:11.320 --> 01:50:13.320]  It's going to be a lot of family members
[01:50:13.320 --> 01:50:16.320]  We're going to be getting some gifts for Thanksgiving
[01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:18.320]  And is that what I'm getting?
[01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:20.320]  Or what's
[01:50:21.320 --> 01:50:23.320]  I got you a special stash brother
[01:50:23.320 --> 01:50:24.320]  Okay
[01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:25.320]  I'm excited
[01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:28.320]  I just need to get over to you
[01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:29.320]  I know
[01:50:29.320 --> 01:50:31.320]  Well alright so
[01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:33.320]  Santa Monica
[01:50:33.320 --> 01:50:35.320]  Is that like 40 minutes?
[01:50:36.320 --> 01:50:38.320]  Yeah it's not that far
[01:50:38.320 --> 01:50:39.320]  It's not that far
[01:50:39.320 --> 01:50:40.320]  It's going to take you about 40 minutes
[01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:42.320]  Depending on traffic nowadays in Southern California
[01:50:42.320 --> 01:50:44.320]  You know it could be 20 minutes
[01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:46.320]  It could be 2 hours depending on traffic
[01:50:46.320 --> 01:50:47.320]  So
[01:50:47.320 --> 01:50:49.320]  I'll get to you brother
[01:50:49.320 --> 01:50:51.320]  I got some really nice melt from the
[01:50:52.320 --> 01:50:53.320]  Monkey berries that we did
[01:50:53.320 --> 01:50:54.320]  The live wash
[01:50:55.320 --> 01:50:56.320]  That one's a unique one
[01:50:56.320 --> 01:50:57.320]  That one's
[01:50:59.320 --> 01:51:00.320]  Exotic Mike
[01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:01.320]  Grease monkey
[01:51:01.320 --> 01:51:02.320]  Genetics
[01:51:02.320 --> 01:51:04.320]  Really really like that one
[01:51:04.320 --> 01:51:07.320]  That's monkey berries in my freezer I'm waiting to
[01:51:07.320 --> 01:51:09.320]  I was one of the ones when he was asking about favorite strains
[01:51:09.320 --> 01:51:10.320]  Okay
[01:51:10.320 --> 01:51:12.320]  So did you get like a rose exhale
[01:51:12.320 --> 01:51:14.320]  Like a floral exhale
[01:51:14.320 --> 01:51:15.320]  Or have you ever
[01:51:15.320 --> 01:51:16.320]  I haven't washed it yet
[01:51:16.320 --> 01:51:17.320]  Okay
[01:51:17.320 --> 01:51:19.320]  I've got so many good ones I'm sitting on
[01:51:19.320 --> 01:51:20.320]  That I just
[01:51:20.320 --> 01:51:23.320]  You know I just haven't been able to get through them since harvest
[01:51:23.320 --> 01:51:24.320]  You know
[01:51:24.320 --> 01:51:25.320]  Too many
[01:51:26.320 --> 01:51:28.320]  It's gas on the inhale
[01:51:28.320 --> 01:51:29.320]  And it's floral
[01:51:30.320 --> 01:51:31.320]  Potpourri almost
[01:51:32.320 --> 01:51:33.320]  On the exhale
[01:51:33.320 --> 01:51:35.320]  It's almost weird like a floral
[01:51:35.320 --> 01:51:36.320]  Really nice I enjoy it
[01:51:37.320 --> 01:51:38.320]  Yeah that whole
[01:51:38.320 --> 01:51:41.320]  Had a real floral to it too that we ran last year
[01:51:41.320 --> 01:51:43.320]  I'm excited to see what I get
[01:51:43.320 --> 01:51:47.320]  I introduced the strawberries and cream F2 back into it
[01:51:47.320 --> 01:51:48.320]  This season
[01:51:48.320 --> 01:51:50.320]  Both of our so we'll see what we get this year
[01:51:50.320 --> 01:51:51.320]  I'm super excited
[01:51:51.320 --> 01:51:53.320]  See what we get from the entire cultivars
[01:51:53.320 --> 01:51:54.320]  So
[01:51:54.320 --> 01:51:55.320]  It should be fun
[01:51:55.320 --> 01:51:56.320]  I always like to play in my backyard
[01:51:56.320 --> 01:51:58.320]  You know I've been playing for a while so
[01:51:58.320 --> 01:52:01.320]  It's kind of a hobby for me or second hobby or passion so
[01:52:02.320 --> 01:52:03.320]  Love
[01:52:03.320 --> 01:52:06.320]  After guitar playing it's your second hobby
[01:52:06.320 --> 01:52:08.320]  You know I haven't played this guitar in a year
[01:52:08.320 --> 01:52:10.320]  I haven't picked it up in a year
[01:52:10.320 --> 01:52:13.320]  I've been so busy with my daughter
[01:52:13.320 --> 01:52:14.320]  She's in college
[01:52:14.320 --> 01:52:16.320]  Actually she should be showing up at John Wayne tonight
[01:52:16.320 --> 01:52:18.320]  And I'm over here with you guys
[01:52:18.320 --> 01:52:21.320]  Life so she'd be showing up through this door in no time
[01:52:21.320 --> 01:52:23.320]  I haven't seen her in about four months
[01:52:23.320 --> 01:52:24.320]  She's up in
[01:52:25.320 --> 01:52:26.320]  Upstate New York in college
[01:52:26.320 --> 01:52:27.320]  So
[01:52:27.320 --> 01:52:28.320]  So
[01:52:29.320 --> 01:52:30.320]  In my parent
[01:52:30.320 --> 01:52:32.320]  And I was waiting to ship it out to LA
[01:52:32.320 --> 01:52:34.320]  In my parents basement
[01:52:34.320 --> 01:52:36.320]  And I had a gold tone electric banjo
[01:52:37.320 --> 01:52:38.320]  And
[01:52:39.320 --> 01:52:40.320]  My brother
[01:52:40.320 --> 01:52:41.320]  Was like
[01:52:41.320 --> 01:52:42.320]  Oh yeah
[01:52:42.320 --> 01:52:43.320]  I sold that
[01:52:44.320 --> 01:52:45.320]  For
[01:52:46.320 --> 01:52:48.320]  At the guitar store
[01:52:48.320 --> 01:52:50.320]  For 250 bucks
[01:52:51.320 --> 01:52:53.320]  And it's like a $1,300
[01:52:54.320 --> 01:52:55.320]  Guitar
[01:52:55.320 --> 01:52:57.320]  And I had to like
[01:52:57.320 --> 01:52:59.320]  Bite my tongue
[01:52:59.320 --> 01:53:01.320]  I want to get a steel international
[01:53:01.320 --> 01:53:03.320]  And I really want to learn how to play
[01:53:03.320 --> 01:53:06.320]  You know I'm inspired with the old timers
[01:53:06.320 --> 01:53:08.320]  You know Robert Johnson, Sun House
[01:53:08.320 --> 01:53:09.320]  I love all that old stuff
[01:53:09.320 --> 01:53:10.320]  Do you play Peter?
[01:53:12.320 --> 01:53:13.320]  I did
[01:53:13.320 --> 01:53:14.320]  I mean
[01:53:14.320 --> 01:53:15.320]  I'm kind of like
[01:53:15.320 --> 01:53:16.320]  I like to
[01:53:16.320 --> 01:53:17.320]  Write music
[01:53:17.320 --> 01:53:18.320]  And like
[01:53:19.320 --> 01:53:22.320]  I would never go on a stage and play in front of people
[01:53:22.320 --> 01:53:23.320]  But like
[01:53:23.320 --> 01:53:25.320]  I would record
[01:53:25.320 --> 01:53:26.320]  Like
[01:53:26.320 --> 01:53:27.320]  Guitar
[01:53:27.320 --> 01:53:28.320]  Like
[01:53:28.320 --> 01:53:29.320]  And drum
[01:53:29.320 --> 01:53:31.320]  Like all instruments
[01:53:31.320 --> 01:53:32.320]  But
[01:53:32.320 --> 01:53:33.320]  By myself
[01:53:33.320 --> 01:53:34.320]  Like
[01:53:34.320 --> 01:53:35.320]  You know
[01:53:35.320 --> 01:53:36.320]  One
[01:53:36.320 --> 01:53:37.320]  Yeah
[01:53:37.320 --> 01:53:38.320]  And just have fun
[01:53:38.320 --> 01:53:40.320]  Like for me it was more fun
[01:53:40.320 --> 01:53:42.320]  If I had more time I'd do more of it
[01:53:42.320 --> 01:53:43.320]  Like I love
[01:53:43.320 --> 01:53:45.320]  Like I use Ableton and
[01:53:46.320 --> 01:53:47.320]  But I haven't done
[01:53:47.320 --> 01:53:48.320]  I used to DJ
[01:53:48.320 --> 01:53:50.320]  Like I used to DJ in big clubs in New York
[01:53:51.320 --> 01:53:52.320]  Nice
[01:53:52.320 --> 01:53:53.320]  Like
[01:53:55.320 --> 01:53:57.320]  Crowbar and Limelight
[01:53:57.320 --> 01:53:59.320]  And other kind of
[01:54:00.320 --> 01:54:01.320]  Cool
[01:54:01.320 --> 01:54:02.320]  New York venues
[01:54:02.320 --> 01:54:03.320]  But
[01:54:03.320 --> 01:54:04.320]  Cool stuff
[01:54:04.320 --> 01:54:05.320]  Now I'm just
[01:54:05.320 --> 01:54:06.320]  Now I'm just a dad
[01:54:08.320 --> 01:54:09.320]  Now I'm on dad duty
[01:54:10.320 --> 01:54:12.320]  I did open mic once
[01:54:12.320 --> 01:54:14.320]  When we first built the guitar
[01:54:14.320 --> 01:54:17.320]  Like this was this little music place
[01:54:17.320 --> 01:54:19.320]  Where I bought the pickup actually
[01:54:19.320 --> 01:54:21.320]  They had like open mic Wednesdays
[01:54:21.320 --> 01:54:23.320]  And my co-workers got
[01:54:23.320 --> 01:54:24.320]  Because we were staying out there
[01:54:24.320 --> 01:54:25.320]  You know
[01:54:25.320 --> 01:54:26.320]  In a hotel
[01:54:26.320 --> 01:54:28.320]  And they got me drunk enough to go out there
[01:54:28.320 --> 01:54:30.320]  And do open mic on that Wednesday
[01:54:30.320 --> 01:54:33.320]  My stage name was Skidmark
[01:54:34.320 --> 01:54:35.320]  Nice
[01:54:37.320 --> 01:54:39.320]  Is that based on reality?
[01:54:39.320 --> 01:54:40.320]  Dude it was good
[01:54:40.320 --> 01:54:41.320]  We had a blast man
[01:54:41.320 --> 01:54:43.320]  It was nice
[01:54:43.320 --> 01:54:44.320]  This dude
[01:54:44.320 --> 01:54:45.320]  I mean we were playing like
[01:54:46.320 --> 01:54:47.320]  I got
[01:54:47.320 --> 01:54:48.320]  What was it? Little Red Rooster
[01:54:48.320 --> 01:54:50.320]  Too Lazy to Crow for Day
[01:54:50.320 --> 01:54:51.320]  We were playing all those old stuff
[01:54:51.320 --> 01:54:52.320]  You know it was fun
[01:54:52.320 --> 01:54:53.320]  We
[01:54:55.320 --> 01:54:56.320]  Dust My Broom
[01:54:56.320 --> 01:54:57.320]  Yeah
[01:54:57.320 --> 01:54:58.320]  We did Dirty
[01:54:58.320 --> 01:54:59.320]  It was fun
[01:54:59.320 --> 01:55:00.320]  It was good
[01:55:00.320 --> 01:55:01.320]  I learned
[01:55:02.320 --> 01:55:03.320]  Muddy Waters
[01:55:03.320 --> 01:55:04.320]  Can't Get Sad
[01:55:05.320 --> 01:55:06.320]  Yeah it's fun
[01:55:08.320 --> 01:55:09.320]  Exactly
[01:55:11.320 --> 01:55:13.320]  So between the two of you
[01:55:13.320 --> 01:55:15.320]  Spending time in Mexico
[01:55:17.320 --> 01:55:18.320]  Did you get any
[01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:22.320]  Any interesting seeds that you've run?
[01:55:23.320 --> 01:55:24.320]  Yes
[01:55:26.320 --> 01:55:27.320]  I've been collecting seeds
[01:55:27.320 --> 01:55:29.320]  Since I started founding seeds in my bags man
[01:55:30.320 --> 01:55:31.320]  Back when I was a teenager
[01:55:31.320 --> 01:55:32.320]  You know
[01:55:33.320 --> 01:55:35.320]  We would travel down to Ticla and Expa
[01:55:35.320 --> 01:55:37.320]  And Michoacan was the Sierra of Michoacan
[01:55:37.320 --> 01:55:38.320]  That's where all the pounds
[01:55:38.320 --> 01:55:40.320]  Big cultivars were coming
[01:55:40.320 --> 01:55:41.320]  I mean it was all seed weed
[01:55:41.320 --> 01:55:43.320]  But it was nice to see us
[01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:45.320]  And I really love this one strand that
[01:55:48.320 --> 01:55:50.320]  You know the locals called Sorrilla
[01:55:50.320 --> 01:55:53.320]  And that Sorrilla apparently came around the area
[01:55:54.320 --> 01:55:55.320]  In the 60s
[01:55:55.320 --> 01:55:56.320]  I don't know the exact origin
[01:55:56.320 --> 01:55:58.320]  That's the whole history that I know about it
[01:55:58.320 --> 01:56:00.320]  But it looks like a hybrid
[01:56:01.320 --> 01:56:03.320]  It's got a skunk flavonoid
[01:56:05.320 --> 01:56:07.320]  I just learned that the skunk is not a terpene
[01:56:07.320 --> 01:56:08.320]  It's a flavonoid
[01:56:09.320 --> 01:56:10.320]  And it's really nice
[01:56:10.320 --> 01:56:11.320]  I really enjoyed it
[01:56:11.320 --> 01:56:13.320]  I brought it back in my earlobes
[01:56:13.320 --> 01:56:14.320]  I got some seeds
[01:56:14.320 --> 01:56:16.320]  And I kind of snuck them in
[01:56:16.320 --> 01:56:17.320]  And I brought them back to the US
[01:56:17.320 --> 01:56:18.320]  We popped them
[01:56:18.320 --> 01:56:21.320]  And I've been crossing that with everything that I find
[01:56:23.320 --> 01:56:24.320]  Just because of the structure of it
[01:56:25.320 --> 01:56:30.320]  And the medicine qualities that it provides for me
[01:56:30.320 --> 01:56:32.320]  It really soothes me down
[01:56:34.320 --> 01:56:35.320]  I really enjoy it
[01:56:35.320 --> 01:56:37.320]  I've crossed it with a lot of stuff
[01:56:37.320 --> 01:56:38.320]  Last cross that I did
[01:56:38.320 --> 01:56:39.320]  I did with Bodhi
[01:56:39.320 --> 01:56:40.320]  Hash plant number 4
[01:56:40.320 --> 01:56:42.320]  And lemon hash plant
[01:56:42.320 --> 01:56:44.320]  And it dumped
[01:56:44.320 --> 01:56:45.320]  It really did
[01:56:46.320 --> 01:56:50.320]  I'm really surprised with the returns that we got this year
[01:56:50.320 --> 01:56:52.320]  And I can't wait to press it
[01:56:52.320 --> 01:56:54.320]  Actually, earlier today I pressed the 160
[01:56:55.320 --> 01:56:56.320]  To see what it did
[01:56:56.320 --> 01:56:58.320]  Warming up the plates here
[01:56:58.320 --> 01:57:00.320]  And we didn't have a blowout
[01:57:01.320 --> 01:57:03.320]  So I can't believe it did that with a 90
[01:57:04.320 --> 01:57:06.320]  But it is what it is
[01:57:08.320 --> 01:57:11.320]  I've enjoyed growing cannabis here in my backyard
[01:57:17.700 --> 01:57:19.700]  We have a frozen Pedro
[01:57:20.700 --> 01:57:21.700]  Mr. Toad
[01:57:21.700 --> 01:57:22.700]  Alright, hold on
[01:57:22.700 --> 01:57:23.700]  He said the Discord
[01:57:23.700 --> 01:57:25.700]  It's just you and me
[01:57:27.700 --> 01:57:29.700]  But I'm multitasking
[01:57:30.700 --> 01:57:32.700]  Mr. Toad
[01:57:34.700 --> 01:57:36.700]  Give me one second
[01:57:40.700 --> 01:57:42.700]  So there's a breeding Discord
[01:57:43.700 --> 01:57:45.700]  And it is boom
[01:57:46.700 --> 01:57:49.700]  And I would love for you to jump in there and talk shop
[01:57:49.700 --> 01:57:50.700]  But I'm not going to
[01:57:50.700 --> 01:57:52.700]  I would love for you to jump in there and talk shop
[01:57:52.700 --> 01:57:53.700]  But I want to bring
[01:57:53.700 --> 01:57:56.700]  Mr. Toad, will you come on and talk breeding
[01:57:58.700 --> 01:58:00.700]  Maybe not next week
[01:58:00.700 --> 01:58:01.700]  Because it's Thanksgiving week
[01:58:01.700 --> 01:58:04.700]  But soon
[01:58:08.940 --> 01:58:11.940]  Alright, so we kind of touched on
[01:58:11.940 --> 01:58:12.940]  But like, alright
[01:58:12.940 --> 01:58:14.940]  So you were talking to
[01:58:15.940 --> 01:58:18.940]  The senior management at Papa and Barclay
[01:58:19.940 --> 01:58:21.940]  Adam G
[01:58:21.940 --> 01:58:23.940]  I met those guys
[01:58:23.940 --> 01:58:24.940]  I randomly
[01:58:24.940 --> 01:58:27.940]  The only high times I think I ever went to
[01:58:30.940 --> 01:58:33.940]  I want to say it was like 2016 or something
[01:58:33.940 --> 01:58:36.940]  But it was maybe 2015, 2016
[01:58:36.940 --> 01:58:38.940]  It was when they were kind of first starting
[01:58:39.940 --> 01:58:41.940]  And I just drove by myself
[01:58:41.940 --> 01:58:43.940]  I went there
[01:58:43.940 --> 01:58:46.940]  And randomly
[01:58:46.940 --> 01:58:49.940]  I just started chatting some people up
[01:58:50.940 --> 01:58:53.940]  And it happened to be G, Adam and this woman
[01:58:53.940 --> 01:58:56.940]  Who was with them in the very beginning
[01:58:56.940 --> 01:58:57.940]  I don't know if she's still with them
[01:58:57.940 --> 01:58:59.940]  And I totally forget her name
[01:58:59.940 --> 01:59:01.940]  Was it Pernille?
[01:59:01.940 --> 01:59:03.940]  What's the name?
[01:59:03.940 --> 01:59:04.940]  Pernille?
[01:59:04.940 --> 01:59:06.940]  No
[01:59:07.940 --> 01:59:09.940]  But basically I was just like
[01:59:10.940 --> 01:59:12.940]  Can I kick it with you guys?
[01:59:12.940 --> 01:59:14.940]  And we just were all super high
[01:59:14.940 --> 01:59:16.940]  And we're wandering around
[01:59:16.940 --> 01:59:17.940]  Like all the boot
[01:59:17.940 --> 01:59:19.940]  It was like hot sun
[01:59:19.940 --> 01:59:22.940]  San Bernardino or wherever it was
[01:59:22.940 --> 01:59:27.940]  And the four of us just hung out for like two, three hours
[01:59:27.940 --> 01:59:30.940]  And I was like, I like these guys
[01:59:31.940 --> 01:59:34.940]  And that was my introduction to G
[01:59:35.940 --> 01:59:36.940]  Yeah
[01:59:36.940 --> 01:59:41.940]  G is an amazing character that is never easily forgotten
[01:59:43.940 --> 01:59:46.940]  A wealth of knowledge and experience
[01:59:46.940 --> 01:59:49.940]  And so much better and so much more comfortable
[01:59:49.940 --> 01:59:51.940]  With this type of stuff than I am
[01:59:52.940 --> 01:59:54.940]  But I could just listen to him talk for days
[01:59:54.940 --> 02:00:00.940]  And you know, he's never short on interesting subjects
[02:00:00.940 --> 02:00:05.940]  Or you know, just dropping some knowledge
[02:00:05.940 --> 02:00:07.940]  But yeah, that was
[02:00:07.940 --> 02:00:12.940]  G was the first person I met at Pop and Barkley
[02:00:12.940 --> 02:00:17.940]  And like I said, we, you know, barely stayed in touch
[02:00:17.940 --> 02:00:21.940]  But we happened to be having a conversation at the right time
[02:00:21.940 --> 02:00:24.940]  And we got to talking about it
[02:00:24.940 --> 02:00:28.940]  And a couple months later we started Pop and Select
[02:00:28.940 --> 02:00:31.940]  There were just three of us at the time
[02:00:32.940 --> 02:00:34.940]  It's down to me and a new team
[02:00:34.940 --> 02:00:36.940]  But it's been a really exciting ride
[02:00:36.940 --> 02:00:39.940]  But yeah, G's always
[02:00:39.940 --> 02:00:42.940]  Always got the best shit to say
[02:00:42.940 --> 02:00:45.940]  And hopefully we can get him on here
[02:00:45.940 --> 02:00:47.940]  In one of these next couple weeks
[02:00:47.940 --> 02:00:49.940]  Maybe after Thanksgiving
[02:00:49.940 --> 02:00:52.940]  I texted him, he didn't respond
[02:00:54.940 --> 02:00:55.940]  Yeah
[02:00:55.940 --> 02:00:57.940]  So tell me if
[02:00:57.940 --> 02:01:00.940]  Here, hold on, let me see if this comes through
[02:01:01.940 --> 02:01:05.940]  This is an image he sent me in
[02:01:05.940 --> 02:01:08.940]  August of 2019
[02:01:11.940 --> 02:01:13.940]  Let me see if I can
[02:01:13.940 --> 02:01:15.940]  There we go, do you see that?
[02:01:15.940 --> 02:01:17.940]  Oh yeah, I know that
[02:01:17.940 --> 02:01:19.940]  Oh you do? Okay
[02:01:19.940 --> 02:01:21.940]  So that's bringing back memories?
[02:01:21.940 --> 02:01:26.940]  Oh yeah, definitely been a great shot that we've used a number of times
[02:01:26.940 --> 02:01:29.940]  But definitely remember that batch
[02:01:30.940 --> 02:01:32.940]  So what's your setup?
[02:01:33.940 --> 02:01:35.940]  So what's your setup?
[02:01:38.940 --> 02:01:41.940]  What's interesting, like Hash isn't really something
[02:01:42.940 --> 02:01:46.940]  It's not like scaling up is let's get a bigger machine
[02:01:46.940 --> 02:01:49.940]  It's like let's get a ton of small machines
[02:01:49.940 --> 02:01:51.940]  And small everything
[02:01:52.940 --> 02:01:54.940]  So what's your setup?
[02:01:54.940 --> 02:01:56.940]  What are you guys
[02:01:58.940 --> 02:02:00.940]  Are you guys using, are you guys hand-watt?
[02:02:00.940 --> 02:02:02.940]  Like with paddles?
[02:02:02.940 --> 02:02:03.940]  Yes?
[02:02:03.940 --> 02:02:04.940]  Hand washing, paddles
[02:02:04.940 --> 02:02:06.940]  Holy shit, at scale?
[02:02:06.940 --> 02:02:07.940]  Yep
[02:02:07.940 --> 02:02:09.940]  Okay, I'm intrigued
[02:02:09.940 --> 02:02:12.940]  Pure pressure, rootless
[02:02:12.940 --> 02:02:14.940]  65 gallon vessels
[02:02:14.940 --> 02:02:16.940]  They're stainless steel jacketed
[02:02:16.940 --> 02:02:18.940]  Super easy to clean
[02:02:18.940 --> 02:02:20.940]  And how many gallons?
[02:02:21.940 --> 02:02:22.940]  65
[02:02:22.940 --> 02:02:24.940]  Oh that's right, that's what you literally just said
[02:02:24.940 --> 02:02:26.940]  Yeah, so
[02:02:27.940 --> 02:02:29.940]  I usually run two a day
[02:02:29.940 --> 02:02:32.940]  Just purchase two more to actually do four a day
[02:02:32.940 --> 02:02:34.940]  And I've used
[02:02:34.940 --> 02:02:38.940]  Alpenglow, I've used Ice Extract and Bolt Bags
[02:02:38.940 --> 02:02:41.940]  I like them both a lot for different reasons
[02:02:42.940 --> 02:02:45.940]  So those two are definitely depending on
[02:02:45.940 --> 02:02:48.940]  The process and the size, I will use both of those
[02:02:48.940 --> 02:02:50.940]  Can you talk about the different reasons?
[02:02:50.940 --> 02:02:53.940]  Like when you would reach for one versus the other?
[02:02:53.940 --> 02:02:57.940]  I love Bolt Bags full mesh Frenchies
[02:02:57.940 --> 02:03:00.940]  They make draining through really big washes
[02:03:00.940 --> 02:03:03.940]  Super easy, super quick and clean
[02:03:04.940 --> 02:03:07.940]  I love Ice Extract, has a 104 micron
[02:03:07.940 --> 02:03:09.940]  Which is really hard to find
[02:03:09.940 --> 02:03:11.940]  But honestly one of my favorite hashes to smoke
[02:03:12.940 --> 02:03:18.940]  And they also have the reinforced ballistic
[02:03:18.940 --> 02:03:20.940]  Coated material
[02:03:20.940 --> 02:03:23.940]  They only have a screen at the bottom
[02:03:23.940 --> 02:03:26.940]  So processing through a lot more at once
[02:03:26.940 --> 02:03:28.940]  Takes some patience
[02:03:29.940 --> 02:03:33.940]  But they're super easy to clean, super durable
[02:03:33.940 --> 02:03:36.940]  So those are my two picks
[02:03:36.940 --> 02:03:39.940]  And I would hate to have to ever choose between them permanently
[02:03:39.940 --> 02:03:43.940]  And then yeah, Pure Pressure is for my equipment
[02:03:43.940 --> 02:03:46.940]  I do their washing vessels
[02:03:46.940 --> 02:03:49.940]  Configured them a little differently in a way that works best for me
[02:03:50.940 --> 02:03:54.940]  And then of course their presses
[02:03:54.940 --> 02:03:57.940]  I'm definitely a fan of their presses
[02:03:57.940 --> 02:04:01.940]  If you can get them, if you can splurge and get one of those
[02:04:01.940 --> 02:04:05.940]  They'll definitely go the distance with you
[02:04:09.270 --> 02:04:11.270]  So in terms of
[02:04:13.270 --> 02:04:19.270]  So how many Bruteless 65 gallon tanks
[02:04:20.270 --> 02:04:23.270]  Do you have a facility at scale?
[02:04:24.270 --> 02:04:26.270]  I have four right now
[02:04:26.270 --> 02:04:27.270]  Okay
[02:04:29.270 --> 02:04:32.270]  So I'm actually waiting on the new expanded water tank
[02:04:32.270 --> 02:04:35.270]  Actually drop today and will be installed this weekend
[02:04:35.270 --> 02:04:37.270]  Bigger ice machine
[02:04:38.270 --> 02:04:40.270]  Two small walk-ins at that facility
[02:04:40.270 --> 02:04:43.270]  And one massive walk-in at another facility
[02:04:43.270 --> 02:04:48.270]  Just to house enough to process through in a year for us
[02:04:49.270 --> 02:04:52.270]  And you know right now
[02:04:52.270 --> 02:04:56.270]  I don't even want to guess how many grams we have in those freezers
[02:04:56.270 --> 02:05:00.270]  But I'll tell you it's way more than anybody could imagine
[02:05:00.270 --> 02:05:03.270]  So when you guys are at
[02:05:03.270 --> 02:05:05.270]  What would peak capacity
[02:05:05.270 --> 02:05:07.270]  Like if you're just crushing it
[02:05:07.270 --> 02:05:10.270]  What's kind of peak output?
[02:05:11.270 --> 02:05:16.270]  Do you guys measure per week, per month, per day, per something?
[02:05:17.270 --> 02:05:19.270]  We usually go by per month
[02:05:22.270 --> 02:05:24.270]  You always slow down a little bit in harvest
[02:05:24.270 --> 02:05:29.270]  There's so much focus on the test washing and the pheno hunting that we're doing as well
[02:05:29.270 --> 02:05:35.270]  But that's kind of where I'm going back and forth with my COO Boris on
[02:05:35.270 --> 02:05:38.270]  Is nailing that down exactly
[02:05:39.270 --> 02:05:42.270]  What are the squabbles that you and Boris have?
[02:05:42.270 --> 02:05:45.270]  You're like I need more X and he's like
[02:05:46.270 --> 02:05:49.270]  Is he the pencil pusher?
[02:05:49.270 --> 02:05:50.270]  Is he like
[02:05:50.270 --> 02:05:51.270]  No actually
[02:05:51.270 --> 02:05:53.270]  Justify yourself
[02:05:53.270 --> 02:05:57.270]  Boris is the reason Papa Select exists
[02:05:57.270 --> 02:06:02.270]  It was his mastermind, Guy, and he made it happen
[02:06:02.270 --> 02:06:07.270]  It definitely took some work the first couple years
[02:06:07.270 --> 02:06:12.270]  We did it slow in order to find all the amazing farms
[02:06:12.270 --> 02:06:18.270]  But Boris is cannabis heart and soul
[02:06:18.270 --> 02:06:21.270]  And he knows his growing
[02:06:21.270 --> 02:06:24.270]  He smokes more hash than anybody I've ever met
[02:06:24.270 --> 02:06:30.270]  So while he is a finance guru
[02:06:30.270 --> 02:06:32.270]  He's definitely not a pencil pusher
[02:06:33.270 --> 02:06:36.270]  So he's an accountant who likes his weed
[02:06:37.270 --> 02:06:40.270]  So yeah, he's definitely very involved
[02:06:42.270 --> 02:06:46.270]  But he wants me to nail down scheduling and costs
[02:06:46.270 --> 02:06:47.270]  And I've got it all
[02:06:47.270 --> 02:06:50.270]  But there's a lot of variables to what we do
[02:06:51.270 --> 02:06:55.270]  And it's easy to see a month or two out
[02:06:55.270 --> 02:06:59.270]  I've got the financials figured out for the next 12 months
[02:06:59.270 --> 02:07:03.270]  But it's the nailed down scheduling that gets a little hard
[02:07:03.270 --> 02:07:05.270]  As everybody knows, you've got a problem with your freeze dryer
[02:07:05.270 --> 02:07:08.270]  Your testing lab takes a couple extra days
[02:07:09.270 --> 02:07:11.270]  Something happens to your transport truck
[02:07:11.270 --> 02:07:13.270]  You can't run for a day
[02:07:13.270 --> 02:07:15.270]  The water pump goes out
[02:07:15.270 --> 02:07:17.270]  There's always something that throws it off
[02:07:17.270 --> 02:07:21.270]  But we just stay dynamic and flexible
[02:07:21.270 --> 02:07:23.270]  And jump to something else
[02:07:26.270 --> 02:07:30.270]  Scheduling further out, doing those broad ones, that's easy
[02:07:31.270 --> 02:07:34.270]  Telling them what's going to come down six weeks from now
[02:07:34.270 --> 02:07:35.270]  That one's a little harder
[02:07:35.270 --> 02:07:37.270]  I also will have a plan
[02:07:37.270 --> 02:07:39.270]  And then something new will pop in my freezer
[02:07:39.270 --> 02:07:41.270]  And it just goes out the window
[02:07:41.270 --> 02:07:43.270]  And I'm like, no, can't wait, got to wash this
[02:07:45.270 --> 02:07:47.270]  And so it is nice to just have that freedom to do that
[02:07:48.270 --> 02:07:51.270]  It works well too for the farmers to be able to
[02:07:51.270 --> 02:07:54.270]  Find all of these phenos and these strains we're doing
[02:07:54.270 --> 02:07:59.270]  It's definitely helpful to be flexible with the scheduling
[02:07:59.270 --> 02:08:02.270]  But it's also so dependent on the strain
[02:08:02.270 --> 02:08:04.270]  What it's going to put out
[02:08:06.270 --> 02:08:08.270]  It's a fun game that he and I play
[02:08:10.270 --> 02:08:13.270]  So you have the Bruteless
[02:08:13.270 --> 02:08:16.270]  And then can you talk about the water and the ice
[02:08:16.270 --> 02:08:18.270]  Is there anything like...
[02:08:20.270 --> 02:08:23.270]  I have my own ice maker at the lab
[02:08:23.270 --> 02:08:26.270]  And have it hooked up to my RO water system
[02:08:27.270 --> 02:08:29.270]  So it's RO water ice cubes?
[02:08:30.270 --> 02:08:31.270]  Yep
[02:08:33.270 --> 02:08:36.270]  And it just keeps it consistent and controlled
[02:08:37.270 --> 02:08:39.270]  I know that there's arguments back and forth
[02:08:39.270 --> 02:08:41.270]  On whether RO is the best
[02:08:41.270 --> 02:08:44.270]  But it's certainly better than tap water
[02:08:44.270 --> 02:08:50.270]  Something I can easily put in the workshop
[02:08:50.270 --> 02:08:54.270]  We're actually having a Kangen water conversation
[02:08:54.270 --> 02:08:55.270]  Tomorrow at 1
[02:08:55.270 --> 02:08:56.270]  Really?
[02:08:56.270 --> 02:08:59.270]  And I always wondered, what if you washed hash
[02:08:59.270 --> 02:09:01.270]  Or structured water?
[02:09:03.270 --> 02:09:04.270]  But...
[02:09:04.270 --> 02:09:07.270]  Okay, so then how about...
[02:09:08.270 --> 02:09:10.270]  What are your go-to bags?
[02:09:10.270 --> 02:09:13.270]  Your micron sizes?
[02:09:16.270 --> 02:09:17.270]  I run all the bags
[02:09:17.270 --> 02:09:18.270]  I run as many bags as I can
[02:09:18.270 --> 02:09:20.270]  It gives you that flexibility
[02:09:21.270 --> 02:09:24.270]  In your process
[02:09:24.270 --> 02:09:28.270]  And we run, especially on any new testing or new strains
[02:09:28.270 --> 02:09:30.270]  You never know what you're going to get
[02:09:31.270 --> 02:09:34.270]  I try to never do full spectrum
[02:09:34.270 --> 02:09:37.270]  Until the very end of the wash
[02:09:37.270 --> 02:09:39.270]  Even then I'll usually keep a 90 in
[02:09:39.270 --> 02:09:43.270]  Just so you keep those premium and standard microns separated
[02:09:44.270 --> 02:09:47.270]  So yeah, we wash all bags all the time pretty much
[02:09:48.270 --> 02:09:50.270]  Do you like the personal taste?
[02:09:50.270 --> 02:09:52.270]  Do you like to smoke full...
[02:09:53.270 --> 02:09:55.270]  Is your personal preference
[02:09:55.270 --> 02:10:00.270]  Like a couple hyper-targeted micron sizes?
[02:10:00.270 --> 02:10:03.270]  Or is it like, I want the broadest...
[02:10:04.270 --> 02:10:07.270]  No, I prefer it to be targeted
[02:10:08.270 --> 02:10:10.270]  And that's why when we release hash
[02:10:10.270 --> 02:10:15.270]  We'll often release the 90 and the 104 and the 120
[02:10:15.270 --> 02:10:18.270]  And it's amazing how different
[02:10:18.270 --> 02:10:22.270]  Even just the profile can be on that small change in the microns
[02:10:22.270 --> 02:10:25.270]  And as far as what terpenes and cannabinoids are inside
[02:10:25.270 --> 02:10:28.270]  Each of those different sized micron heads
[02:10:29.270 --> 02:10:32.270]  It's pretty astounding actually
[02:10:36.270 --> 02:10:38.270]  Sorry, I'm looking at the chat right now
[02:10:38.270 --> 02:10:41.270]  Where people are posting
[02:10:41.270 --> 02:10:43.270]  What about Arizona?
[02:10:43.270 --> 02:10:44.270]  So you're watching...
[02:10:44.270 --> 02:10:46.270]  Alright, so you can see what I'm seeing
[02:10:47.270 --> 02:10:48.270]  Okay
[02:10:50.270 --> 02:10:53.270]  So what fascinates me about you guys
[02:10:53.270 --> 02:10:55.270]  Is just kind of like
[02:10:55.270 --> 02:10:58.270]  Hash at scale is not like
[02:10:59.270 --> 02:11:01.270]  Solvent at scale
[02:11:01.270 --> 02:11:03.270]  And so it's kind of like
[02:11:05.270 --> 02:11:07.270]  It's a craft
[02:11:09.270 --> 02:11:10.270]  And so it's kind of like
[02:11:10.270 --> 02:11:12.270]  How do you do certain things at scale?
[02:11:12.270 --> 02:11:14.270]  And then for me what's always interesting
[02:11:14.270 --> 02:11:17.270]  Is people in the commercial market
[02:11:18.270 --> 02:11:22.270]  Talk about a couple cultivars
[02:11:22.270 --> 02:11:26.270]  That the California commercial market loves
[02:11:27.270 --> 02:11:30.270]  And contradict that with something that you love
[02:11:30.270 --> 02:11:32.270]  That just doesn't resonate with the market
[02:11:34.270 --> 02:11:37.270]  It would be like top 40 music
[02:11:37.270 --> 02:11:39.270]  But here's what I like
[02:11:40.270 --> 02:11:41.270]  I gotta play the top 40
[02:11:41.270 --> 02:11:44.270]  But I actually like something totally different
[02:11:45.270 --> 02:11:47.270]  I love tangy strains
[02:11:47.270 --> 02:11:51.270]  I love really good clean citrus terps
[02:11:51.270 --> 02:11:54.270]  And I'm kind of shocked
[02:11:54.270 --> 02:11:56.270]  You have those people that love it too
[02:11:56.270 --> 02:11:58.270]  But they seem to be few and far between
[02:11:59.270 --> 02:12:02.270]  We have a dirty tangy strain that I've gotten
[02:12:03.270 --> 02:12:05.270]  Even the people who say they hate citrus terps
[02:12:05.270 --> 02:12:09.270]  Say they hate tangy strains
[02:12:10.270 --> 02:12:12.270]  If you ever see that dirty tangy
[02:12:12.270 --> 02:12:13.270]  Make sure to grab it
[02:12:13.270 --> 02:12:14.270]  It's incredible
[02:12:16.270 --> 02:12:18.270]  It's one of my favorites
[02:12:18.270 --> 02:12:20.270]  I never think it's enough love out there
[02:12:21.270 --> 02:12:22.270]  To each their own
[02:12:23.270 --> 02:12:26.270]  But I never liked Blue Dream
[02:12:26.270 --> 02:12:27.270]  Ever
[02:12:28.270 --> 02:12:30.270]  Did you just see that comment?
[02:12:30.270 --> 02:12:31.270]  No
[02:12:31.270 --> 02:12:32.270]  Oh shit
[02:12:34.270 --> 02:12:37.270]  I thought you saw the comment and then said that
[02:12:38.270 --> 02:12:40.270]  No, it's just one of those strains around here
[02:12:40.270 --> 02:12:42.270]  That a couple years back
[02:12:42.270 --> 02:12:44.270]  You couldn't throw a stick and not hit some Blue Dream
[02:12:46.270 --> 02:12:49.270]  I remember flying out to New York for a music festival
[02:12:49.270 --> 02:12:51.270]  And I was so excited to smoke something different
[02:12:52.270 --> 02:12:55.270]  Finally find a guy with some good bud
[02:12:56.270 --> 02:12:58.270]  And he's like, yeah, this is Blue Dream
[02:12:58.270 --> 02:13:00.270]  And it was grown like 10 miles from where I lived
[02:13:01.270 --> 02:13:04.270]  I was just like, can't escape it
[02:13:07.270 --> 02:13:09.270]  But yeah, Blue Dream
[02:13:09.270 --> 02:13:11.270]  Even the cake strains
[02:13:12.270 --> 02:13:14.270]  A lot of love and respect for them
[02:13:16.270 --> 02:13:19.270]  They're not my top five
[02:13:20.270 --> 02:13:22.270]  The amazing ones are amazing
[02:13:23.270 --> 02:13:26.270]  We all have our favorites
[02:13:26.270 --> 02:13:27.270]  What about you?
[02:13:27.270 --> 02:13:29.270]  What do you like or not like?
[02:13:30.270 --> 02:13:32.270]  I'm very non-discriminatory
[02:13:32.270 --> 02:13:36.270]  I like to sample and explore
[02:13:38.270 --> 02:13:40.270]  I'm also not a...
[02:13:40.270 --> 02:13:42.270]  Well, let me get on camera too
[02:13:48.270 --> 02:13:50.270]  I prefer flour
[02:13:51.270 --> 02:13:52.270]  I like everything
[02:13:54.270 --> 02:13:56.270]  I would smoke more weed in the garage
[02:13:56.270 --> 02:13:59.270]  And people are always like, why aren't you smoking more?
[02:13:59.270 --> 02:14:01.270]  We never see you smoke
[02:14:02.270 --> 02:14:05.270]  The other night I was ripping two
[02:14:05.270 --> 02:14:07.270]  Mind-numbing bong hits
[02:14:07.270 --> 02:14:09.270]  And then my two-year-old
[02:14:09.270 --> 02:14:11.270]  Who I totally thought would have been in bed
[02:14:11.270 --> 02:14:13.270]  Came into the garage
[02:14:13.270 --> 02:14:17.270]  And my wife got really not happy with me about that
[02:14:20.270 --> 02:14:22.270]  Someone likes your taste
[02:14:26.270 --> 02:14:32.270]  On kind of the competitive circuit
[02:14:33.270 --> 02:14:37.270]  I feel like stuff that is new
[02:14:37.270 --> 02:14:41.270]  Typically wins first and second place
[02:14:43.270 --> 02:14:45.270]  And I've talked about this before
[02:14:45.270 --> 02:14:47.270]  But like banana oji
[02:14:49.270 --> 02:14:53.270]  Something that people are like, that's a new taste
[02:14:56.270 --> 02:14:58.270]  People always want something new
[02:14:58.270 --> 02:15:01.270]  And I think it resonates as exciting with the judges
[02:15:02.270 --> 02:15:04.270]  You may have your old classic that you love
[02:15:04.270 --> 02:15:08.270]  But you hit it and it doesn't make you stop and think about it
[02:15:09.270 --> 02:15:12.270]  You're like, oh, this is great
[02:15:13.270 --> 02:15:15.270]  It's a good old standby
[02:15:15.270 --> 02:15:18.270]  But I always feel like if you taste something new
[02:15:18.270 --> 02:15:21.270]  It's just that, it's just new and exciting
[02:15:21.270 --> 02:15:25.270]  And that is a big part of the strain hunting
[02:15:26.270 --> 02:15:29.270]  Myself included, I don't want to smoke the same thing
[02:15:29.270 --> 02:15:31.270]  Day in and day out
[02:15:31.270 --> 02:15:33.270]  When we started Select
[02:15:33.270 --> 02:15:38.270]  There were very, very brief discussions about being vertically integrated
[02:15:41.270 --> 02:15:43.270]  One, that's just two businesses running
[02:15:43.270 --> 02:15:47.270]  But two, it was a way to support the community
[02:15:47.270 --> 02:15:49.270]  But a way to keep that variety up
[02:15:51.270 --> 02:15:55.270]  I love even taking the same strain from two different farmers
[02:15:55.270 --> 02:15:57.270]  And I'll have them side by side
[02:15:57.270 --> 02:15:59.270]  And I'll smoke them one after the other
[02:15:59.270 --> 02:16:01.270]  And love them both
[02:16:01.270 --> 02:16:03.270]  But it's just fun that way
[02:16:03.270 --> 02:16:08.270]  And I think that it keeps our genetics on point
[02:16:11.270 --> 02:16:13.270]  And keeps our breeders going
[02:16:13.270 --> 02:16:15.270]  And it's just great to have the potential
[02:16:15.270 --> 02:16:19.270]  And the unending possibilities we have with the cannabis cultivars
[02:16:21.270 --> 02:16:24.270]  And I think that's really a lot of fun of this
[02:16:24.270 --> 02:16:29.270]  Searching and finding those great breeders and seeds and popping them
[02:16:30.270 --> 02:16:33.270]  I think that stuff's always going to come out in the competitions
[02:16:34.270 --> 02:16:40.270]  Is there sometimes stuff that doesn't yield well
[02:16:40.270 --> 02:16:42.270]  But that you're like, this is delicious
[02:16:42.270 --> 02:16:45.270]  But it's just not commercially viable?
[02:16:45.270 --> 02:16:47.270]  All the freaking time
[02:16:49.270 --> 02:16:51.270]  And that is what our biggest
[02:16:51.270 --> 02:16:53.270]  So if you could be gluttonous and be like
[02:16:53.270 --> 02:16:55.270]  I'm just washing this for myself
[02:16:55.270 --> 02:16:57.270]  Because it's not commercially viable
[02:16:57.270 --> 02:17:01.270]  Give me an example or two of stuff that doesn't
[02:17:01.270 --> 02:17:05.270]  It's not a high yielder, but you love it
[02:17:05.270 --> 02:17:10.270]  Found a pretty spectacular batch of white runts
[02:17:10.270 --> 02:17:12.270]  From Humboldt Kine
[02:17:12.270 --> 02:17:14.270]  That has a really unique profile
[02:17:14.270 --> 02:17:17.270]  Runts, you know, traditionally for the longest time
[02:17:17.270 --> 02:17:19.270]  Runts does not wash well
[02:17:20.270 --> 02:17:23.270]  It's a low yielder, but I have just enough of it
[02:17:23.270 --> 02:17:26.270]  That one day it will be a really special drop
[02:17:26.270 --> 02:17:28.270]  Or it will be an entry
[02:17:30.270 --> 02:17:33.270]  Middle Eastern and South Asian varieties
[02:17:34.270 --> 02:17:35.270]  Yeah, they did
[02:17:35.270 --> 02:17:37.270]  And you tend to find that
[02:17:38.270 --> 02:17:41.270]  You know, there are certain varietals that definitely do better
[02:17:41.270 --> 02:17:45.270]  And, you know, Indica, heavy THC ones
[02:17:46.270 --> 02:17:48.270]  CBD does not wash
[02:17:48.270 --> 02:17:51.270]  It just doesn't respond to that solventless process
[02:17:52.270 --> 02:17:54.270]  And there are some that are amazing that just don't
[02:17:54.270 --> 02:17:58.270]  And it can look good, feel good, smell good
[02:17:58.270 --> 02:18:01.270]  But that's always the test for us
[02:18:01.270 --> 02:18:03.270]  Is does it wash, does it yield?
[02:18:03.270 --> 02:18:09.270]  And, you know, it's easy to kind of pick out the quality on the farm
[02:18:09.270 --> 02:18:13.270]  But you really never know until you wash it if it's good
[02:18:13.270 --> 02:18:15.270]  Vanilla runts
[02:18:15.270 --> 02:18:17.270]  I haven't tried that one yet
[02:18:19.270 --> 02:18:21.270]  In Canada, they got no runts
[02:18:23.270 --> 02:18:25.270]  Come to California
[02:18:25.270 --> 02:18:27.270]  So, just quickly
[02:18:27.270 --> 02:18:33.270]  I'm being summoned by my wife to come upstairs
[02:18:33.270 --> 02:18:35.270]  I gotta go make some babies
[02:18:37.270 --> 02:18:43.270]  But, Gillian, I love that now it's just you and me
[02:18:43.270 --> 02:18:45.270]  It's like everybody else disappeared
[02:18:45.270 --> 02:18:47.270]  And it's the two of us
[02:18:47.270 --> 02:18:49.270]  I see banana runs
[02:18:49.270 --> 02:18:51.270]  Yeah, the nine pound hammer
[02:18:58.800 --> 02:19:00.800]  Yeah, banana was big last year
[02:19:01.800 --> 02:19:04.800]  Well, I have some rotten bananas that I'm gonna be washing
[02:19:04.800 --> 02:19:08.800]  That's a GMO times, or excuse me, garlic cookies times banana OG
[02:19:08.800 --> 02:19:11.800]  That's gonna be insane
[02:19:11.800 --> 02:19:16.800]  And a nice new twist on the banana strains
[02:19:17.800 --> 02:19:21.460]  Alright, well, we will
[02:19:21.460 --> 02:19:27.460]  Gillian, if you're willing, I'd love to bring you back for future
[02:19:27.460 --> 02:19:30.460]  I hope this was chill enough for you
[02:19:30.460 --> 02:19:32.460]  I'd love to
[02:19:32.460 --> 02:19:35.460]  It's, you know, it's not really my forte
[02:19:35.460 --> 02:19:40.460]  But it's nice and relaxing, so I appreciate it
[02:19:40.460 --> 02:19:42.460]  As I said, this is public access
[02:19:42.460 --> 02:19:44.460]  The expectations are not very high
[02:19:44.460 --> 02:19:48.460]  For the conversation, the music, the whatever
[02:19:50.460 --> 02:19:52.460]  It was perfect
[02:19:52.460 --> 02:19:54.460]  I appreciate that you jumped on with us
[02:19:54.460 --> 02:19:56.460]  And you can be
[02:19:56.460 --> 02:20:00.460]  I love the idea of having like the
[02:20:00.460 --> 02:20:03.460]  Like people pressing or washing
[02:20:03.460 --> 02:20:08.460]  And like the panel of judges
[02:20:08.460 --> 02:20:12.460]  Just kind of like providing the color commentary and asking questions
[02:20:12.460 --> 02:20:15.460]  So if you want to be on those panels
[02:20:15.460 --> 02:20:17.460]  I'd love to have you
[02:20:17.460 --> 02:20:20.460]  Yeah, let me see, I just got a new press
[02:20:20.460 --> 02:20:22.460]  In a box still actually delivered
[02:20:22.460 --> 02:20:24.460]  A couple hours ago, so
[02:20:24.460 --> 02:20:28.460]  Yeah, well, you can step up and do some pressing
[02:20:28.460 --> 02:20:31.460]  Yeah, maybe between now and two weeks from now
[02:20:31.460 --> 02:20:34.460]  I live in the lab at the moment, but
[02:20:35.460 --> 02:20:38.460]  But sometimes you get to go home
[02:20:38.460 --> 02:20:41.460]  So the press is at home, this is like the home setup
[02:20:41.460 --> 02:20:43.460]  Yeah
[02:20:43.460 --> 02:20:50.460]  And what presses are you guys using in the facility?
[02:20:50.460 --> 02:20:52.460]  The peer pressure
[02:20:52.460 --> 02:20:54.460]  Okay
[02:20:54.460 --> 02:20:56.460]  And what bags?
[02:20:56.460 --> 02:21:01.460]  Rosin Evolution, the 25 micron that they were showing earlier
[02:21:01.460 --> 02:21:03.460]  Okay
[02:21:04.460 --> 02:21:10.460]  So peer pressure tanks, peer pressure presses
[02:21:10.460 --> 02:21:13.460]  Rosin Evolution bags
[02:21:13.460 --> 02:21:17.460]  You have some harvest rights I assume
[02:21:17.460 --> 02:21:19.460]  For now
[02:21:21.460 --> 02:21:24.460]  What would you like? Is there something else out there?
[02:21:24.460 --> 02:21:29.460]  Yeah, Nick, I'm like four to five beers in right now
[02:21:29.460 --> 02:21:32.460]  So give me, yeah
[02:21:32.460 --> 02:21:36.460]  I may ask repetitive questions, but
[02:21:36.460 --> 02:21:39.460]  That's okay, I probably won't remember
[02:21:39.460 --> 02:21:40.460]  Right
[02:21:40.460 --> 02:21:42.460]  So
[02:21:42.460 --> 02:21:47.460]  You need to get right, yes, the doctor, right?
[02:21:47.460 --> 02:21:49.460]  He's old school
[02:21:49.460 --> 02:21:54.460]  And people support the idea of bringing you back, you're a keeper
[02:21:54.460 --> 02:21:58.460]  Thanks, I appreciate y'all and all of you
[02:21:58.460 --> 02:22:02.460]  All right, well with that, we'll call it
[02:22:02.460 --> 02:22:07.460]  Because we got an 8 a.m.
[02:22:07.460 --> 02:22:09.460]  And I always get this backwards
[02:22:09.460 --> 02:22:14.460]  Sequentially, coffee, morning poo, and a garden tour
[02:22:14.460 --> 02:22:16.460]  That's at 8 a.m.
[02:22:16.460 --> 02:22:22.460]  And Eric Brandstad is going to be doing the Kangen water
[02:22:22.460 --> 02:22:26.460]  Basically what it is, is he's been doing research with Kangen
[02:22:26.460 --> 02:22:30.460]  Supplies to cannabis and actually specifically IPM with pests
[02:22:30.460 --> 02:22:35.460]  Because evidently certain pests do not like the Kangen water
[02:22:35.460 --> 02:22:38.460]  When they're sprayed with it
[02:22:38.460 --> 02:22:42.460]  Which is interesting, but that's at 1 a.m. tomorrow
[02:22:45.460 --> 02:22:49.460]  We have other shows, but
[02:22:49.460 --> 02:22:52.460]  Tomorrow those are the two shows as of now
[02:22:52.460 --> 02:22:56.460]  So Jillian, thanks for jumping on
[02:22:56.460 --> 02:23:00.460]  Have a good night and everybody else, we'll see you in the morning
[02:23:00.460 --> 02:23:04.460]  Thanks Peter, thanks for all the love everyone
[02:23:04.460 --> 02:23:08.460]  And Mr. Toad, I will hit you up
[02:23:08.460 --> 02:23:12.460]  For some breeding conversations
[02:23:12.460 --> 02:23:15.460]  And with that, I will kill the live stream
[02:23:15.460 --> 02:23:17.460]  Thanks everyone
