[18:36.390 --> 18:40.390]  ...
[18:40.390 --> 18:44.390]  ...
[18:44.390 --> 18:48.390]  ...
[18:48.390 --> 18:52.390]  ...
[18:52.390 --> 18:56.390]  ...
[18:56.390 --> 19:00.390]  ...
[19:00.390 --> 19:04.390]  ...
[19:04.390 --> 19:10.310]  But there was also even an earlier time period where Ed Rosenthal was doing like he was deputized
[19:10.310 --> 19:19.030]  by this city of Oakland by Jerry Brown to run a nursery essentially. And so he was throwing cuts
[19:19.030 --> 19:23.270]  that were being distributed to everybody and it's when he had produced that book.
[19:25.110 --> 19:30.550]  Ed Rosenthal's book of buds or big book of buds where it was just like an advertisement for the
[19:30.550 --> 19:36.230]  Oakster Dam. Yeah and for like Amsterdam seed companies essentially. Everybody just had all
[19:36.230 --> 19:41.750]  their varieties in there with a description and it was like a little sales pamphlet essentially.
[19:41.750 --> 19:49.270]  Which kind of shows you how it shifted too though you know the Dutch was the goal for a long time
[19:49.270 --> 19:56.070]  but now it's definitely just American genetics. Yeah and like that was really the shift I feel
[19:56.070 --> 20:04.870]  like in that time period the early 2000-2004 time period. We could get a lot of Dutch genetics over
[20:04.870 --> 20:11.190]  here that were from seed that were things like Ed Rosenthal was producing because he was literally
[20:11.190 --> 20:17.430]  producing all different things out of that book that you could then go in and get off the shelf
[20:17.430 --> 20:24.870]  at like Berkeley Patients Group. And some of them were fire but then you know a lot of them weren't
[20:25.350 --> 20:32.470]  all that amazing and so it was like a real-time comparison and like window into what was
[20:32.470 --> 20:39.990]  happening in Amsterdam in the seed company or like seed industry at that time. And it didn't
[20:39.990 --> 20:47.270]  I don't feel like it necessarily was competing like the stuff that you would see in NorCal in
[20:47.270 --> 20:53.110]  the medical scene that was being produced locally either through people's individual selection from
[20:53.110 --> 20:59.670]  Amsterdam gear or from stuff that had just been in the Americas for you know the last 30-40 years.
[21:00.310 --> 21:08.390]  Those were definitely like you know Mendo just random seeds trimming up in Mendo and popping
[21:08.390 --> 21:13.910]  those off were hitting just as hard if not harder than those early odds Amsterdam seeds.
[21:14.950 --> 21:20.390]  Yeah and that's you know that's what I was gonna ask too because it seems like the you know the
[21:20.470 --> 21:26.710]  Emerald Triangle is kind of its own universe you know it's independent or at least when I think of
[21:26.710 --> 21:32.950]  like strains and going back it seemed to be independent in that time from San Francisco.
[21:32.950 --> 21:39.670]  It seemed to be independent from LA. I'm sure the flower was all connected but it's just like the
[21:39.670 --> 21:46.470]  genetics maybe because it was more of a necessity in the hills like you had to have something that
[21:46.470 --> 21:53.030]  would grow good you had to have something that would move. You know I imagine because some of
[21:53.030 --> 21:59.910]  the cuts that came out of there gosh Grape Ape came out of there didn't it? Out of Mendo. Yeah
[22:00.790 --> 22:03.990]  yeah so the Urples came out of there.
[22:07.990 --> 22:15.990]  These are clone-olies. Granddaddy Purple. There was even back like further back in the day there
[22:16.070 --> 22:23.030]  was the Salmon Creek Big Bud. There was there were a number of things up in that area that
[22:25.190 --> 22:32.950]  it's different and unique because particularly rural California we're all very spread out
[22:32.950 --> 22:39.910]  and have our little enclaves and our also our own little like personal enclaves. So there were people
[22:39.910 --> 22:46.150]  up on Spy Rock, people up on Bell Springs who were their own little world and universe that
[22:46.150 --> 22:50.790]  were completely separate from people over in Willow Creek or in different parts of Humboldt.
[22:50.790 --> 22:58.150]  And like their their genetic gene pool that they were playing in wasn't at all connected and wasn't
[22:58.150 --> 23:05.510]  getting hybridized between each other. They were just growers on completely separate social and
[23:06.470 --> 23:13.110]  you know geographic areas even though they were only you know an hour away or something
[23:13.830 --> 23:20.230]  in in the same county or in the same region. And I feel like that's something that's true down here
[23:20.230 --> 23:26.630]  in the foothills. Grass Valley they've got all their own stuff down here we've got our own things
[23:26.630 --> 23:35.110]  and so it's I feel like they're up in Mendo and Humboldt they had a lot of things that they started
[23:35.110 --> 23:43.030]  to select in that time period and or bring into that area because there was a shift away from the
[23:43.030 --> 23:49.030]  traditional seed production and the market kind of influenced people to go towards those commercial
[23:49.030 --> 23:57.670]  varieties. And I joke it was purple to the bay and gas to LA. That was what you're saying. Purple weed
[23:58.550 --> 24:07.750]  would has always been very big in the bay area. Type music e40s part of that like they had
[24:07.750 --> 24:19.270]  connections with trichome technologies and so he was the dude who bred and produced the first
[24:19.270 --> 24:25.510]  purple cush variety. SR781 purple cush? Yep yep. Is my favorite. Sorry to interrupt you.
[24:26.310 --> 24:33.750]  This is my favorite purple weed in the world by far but it's like top five. I smoke a lot of good
[24:33.750 --> 24:40.870]  weed and I absolutely love this weed. It helps me sleep and it's great medicine. Sorry to interrupt
[24:40.870 --> 24:46.390]  you though. It's really nice to meet you though. I'm Dawgs. My name is Connor but I'm a fan of your
[24:46.390 --> 24:50.630]  work and I've been following you on here for a long time so it's really cool to meet you and be
[24:50.630 --> 24:56.790]  on a panel with you. Likewise man. Thank you. I appreciate you guys sharing the floor with me.
[24:58.950 --> 25:05.190]  Chat hit me up and I was like yeah. Yeah absolutely. You're a great historian and
[25:05.190 --> 25:11.190]  I was kind of getting to this earlier. I'm glad that you two are together and we're able to do
[25:11.190 --> 25:18.950]  this tonight because A. I'm sure you're sick of hearing this Dawg viz but you look young because
[25:18.950 --> 25:27.510]  you are young. Now some OGs are just like you know this guy can't possibly know what he knows
[25:27.510 --> 25:34.070]  or have cuts that he has and it's just out of just like sheer ignorance but I'm just straight up
[25:34.070 --> 25:38.470]  putting that to rest right now. You know one of the things that I've enjoyed about Dawg Days is
[25:38.470 --> 25:43.910]  just you're like you're in genuine enthusiasm. Your genuine desire to learn to know the history
[25:43.910 --> 25:49.670]  so to actually like do some of the legwork and try to dig you know and I'm not saying this
[25:49.670 --> 25:53.990]  directly to you but caveat sometimes you know we dig in the wrong direction so we might get things
[25:53.990 --> 26:02.150]  wrong but that doesn't detract from the amount of desire or purpose that we have. So while you look
[26:02.150 --> 26:07.670]  young you've got some really awesome things and some good knowledge to share too. So you know the
[26:07.670 --> 26:12.790]  conversation I think with Trevor will be very very good to have because it's complimentary you know
[26:13.910 --> 26:20.470]  you focused a lot kind of on some of the east coast varieties. I know like JJ Top Dawg is kind
[26:20.470 --> 26:27.350]  of one of your one of your people that you really looked up to. Maybe you know tell us how you even
[26:27.350 --> 26:33.350]  kind of came across JJ or got into him. Why you wanted to collect his strains and get some of the
[26:33.990 --> 26:41.510]  unreleased stuff that you have from him. Well the first time I heard about JJ was on the forums
[26:41.510 --> 26:46.630]  and like I wasn't on the forums and I didn't even really know what the forums were when I was
[26:46.630 --> 26:53.110]  looking at them. I was like 13 the first time I was looking at like IC Mag and Roll It Up and
[26:53.670 --> 26:59.190]  I think THC Farmer. I would google information about the weed that I was smoking in Montana
[26:59.190 --> 27:05.350]  and like I was exposed to a lot of different kinds of good weed when I very first started smoking.
[27:05.350 --> 27:11.190]  Like this could be a short synopsis of it. When I started smoking I moved in with my grandmother
[27:11.510 --> 27:16.710]  they were growing medically. I got you know I started to smoke I started to get involved with the grow and I
[27:16.710 --> 27:20.790]  fell in love with it. Like all the different varieties of cannabis even though they were
[27:20.790 --> 27:26.150]  growing they would still go buy like a whole like seven new kinds of weed every week from a different
[27:26.150 --> 27:30.870]  shop. Like they they also loved all the varieties. They moved up there from Utah they were used to
[27:30.870 --> 27:36.630]  smoking brick weed and they got up there and they were like oh my god and so that she has this
[27:36.630 --> 27:41.430]  notebook dude and I shit you not they've tried over a thousand different kinds of weed. When I was up
[27:41.430 --> 27:48.550]  there when I moved there in 2011 it was uh they had tried like 400 and in the six months that I
[27:48.550 --> 27:53.670]  was there before I moved back the first time I tried almost 200 different kinds of weed.
[27:53.670 --> 27:58.390]  Like she kept track of that shit like she marked the date I got that it was insane.
[27:58.390 --> 28:03.430]  I couldn't believe it either I don't even remember. I tried doing that but I lost motivation after a
[28:03.430 --> 28:07.910]  while. I still kept some of the bags from the Dispo weed though with a little rating system on them.
[28:08.310 --> 28:13.430]  Like I think she still does or she might have gave up because I imagine they probably smoke
[28:13.430 --> 28:20.630]  everything in the state of Montana by now but uh yeah it was like I was really really intrigued by
[28:20.630 --> 28:28.070]  all the different cannabis. I could at that point in my life too being young being like a new smoker
[28:28.070 --> 28:33.190]  I could totally feel the nuance of the individual strains or you know cuts or whatever you want to
[28:33.190 --> 28:37.910]  call them. Like I could really feel the nuance. There was this pineapple express we had I don't
[28:37.910 --> 28:42.870]  know if it was the pineapple express or if there even is a the pineapple express but whatever it
[28:42.870 --> 28:48.150]  was it was like speed. I would smoke it I would jump up off the couch and go do chores and clean
[28:48.150 --> 28:55.910]  the house like it was so cool but uh I just loved that and JJ was like I loved sour diesel and chem
[28:55.910 --> 29:02.310]  dog and all that so I came across JJ's posts on the forums uh talking about the lineage and the
[29:02.310 --> 29:11.910]  history of uh sour d and chem and that was where I had heard about the DNL and so I uh got the DNL
[29:11.910 --> 29:20.310]  bat cross f2s and he uh like he made his mail for the and he took a NL um put it onto a super skunk
[29:20.310 --> 29:26.310]  and then took a NL super skunk for the uh the out cross on this bat cross which was like I thought
[29:26.310 --> 29:31.030]  that was really cool because the DNL itself is supposed to be some sort of skunk crossed with
[29:31.030 --> 29:36.630]  an NL so I got these are pretty old these are like eight years old but I got three of them to
[29:36.630 --> 29:42.630]  pop already I'm pretty happy about that but uh yeah I was just a huge fan of JJ uh from the time
[29:42.630 --> 29:47.830]  I was young hearing like the stuff he said about history and I did notice that he had read things
[29:47.830 --> 29:53.510]  I read about his Colorado super skunk and like doubt it had to have been when it was kind of
[29:53.510 --> 29:57.910]  new because I was young I was still a teenager but I did end up getting some of those eventually
[29:57.990 --> 30:03.830]  and growing them that was pretty cool right on and sorry to cut you off there Trevor we're
[30:03.830 --> 30:15.830]  talking you're talking about SR-71 yeah sorry yeah yeah no um oh Kenny uh Trichome Technologies
[30:15.830 --> 30:26.230]  he kind of helped he bred the purple push released the purple push um and he's he's got connections
[30:26.230 --> 30:33.750]  with Be Legit and so when E-40 and Be Legit and people like that rap about purple weed
[30:33.750 --> 30:39.030]  some of the early purple weed that they were smoking on was literally from him and he talked
[30:39.030 --> 30:47.590]  about yeah yeah he talked about um I interviewed him and did the Breeding the Culture series on him
[30:47.590 --> 30:54.150]  or uh installment on him and uh he talked about his time doing photo shoots with Be Legit and like
[30:54.150 --> 31:00.230]  the flowers that are on certain albums are all like his flowers and that some of those references
[31:00.230 --> 31:05.910]  obviously are them they're referencing his weed because he was the guy who was like producing
[31:05.910 --> 31:12.390]  the purples they were smoking and um and that like created a massive trend I feel like
[31:13.990 --> 31:21.190]  in the Bay Area in the probably by 2004 if you didn't have purple if you weren't sending
[31:21.190 --> 31:27.830]  something like an Urkel or a you know later GDP or some of the things in that range
[31:29.190 --> 31:33.830]  you just weren't selling well in the Bay like you could do other things you could do gas you
[31:33.830 --> 31:42.150]  could do stuff like that but they all had their price point like their like their customer base
[31:42.150 --> 31:49.750]  but like nothing sold like purples and that's why so many of those different purples that we know
[31:49.830 --> 31:53.910]  and there were a whole bunch more back in the day there was a purple Cadillac and a number of
[31:53.910 --> 32:03.830]  different purple varieties that were on clone shelves and dispensaries and um the uh I feel
[32:03.830 --> 32:09.750]  like cookies kind of to a certain extent killed a lot of that where it was like that was the last
[32:09.750 --> 32:18.230]  iteration of the purple weed and ever since then instead of it being you know grape a
[32:19.030 --> 32:27.510]  uh purple Urkel granddaddy purple etc etc and there's a huge plethora of different purples
[32:28.070 --> 32:33.910]  now all the purples are just variations on cookies and while it's true that
[32:35.670 --> 32:42.390]  there's probably some relation between the Mendo Purps and the uh the different purples that were
[32:42.390 --> 32:51.590]  coming out in the early you know 2000s but those ones to my mind I'm nostalgic for and I prefer
[32:51.590 --> 33:01.670]  the Turp profile on them so I just I was like damn I wish we hadn't hadn't gone so hard on the cookies
[33:01.670 --> 33:06.550]  and lost just in general circulation I'm not saying that these are gone they're definitely
[33:06.630 --> 33:12.710]  people that are holding GDP and purple Urkel and other cuts like this but they're not in general
[33:12.710 --> 33:19.430]  circulation and it wasn't like you could go anywhere in California and pick up cuts of purple
[33:19.430 --> 33:25.750]  Urkel and a lot of these cuts back in the day or you knew somebody who had them and they were just
[33:25.750 --> 33:32.070]  so easy that you totally took it for granted and yeah so I'm stoked that there's you know
[33:32.950 --> 33:37.270]  there's a whole nother generation and there's a little bit more openness there's a
[33:38.630 --> 33:43.510]  the fact that you can reach out to JJ and you can get unreleased here you can get on the different
[33:44.950 --> 33:53.030]  new forums you know like this for different stuff like this I think that's legit and that there is a
[33:54.550 --> 33:59.350]  there's a conscious concerted effort by different people even though everybody's got their own
[33:59.350 --> 34:06.790]  little cliques and niches and beeps and all that stuff that people are trying to preserve and
[34:07.830 --> 34:13.510]  share some of these genetics or monetize them whatever it may be but like if you do your due
[34:13.510 --> 34:20.870]  diligence like dogs has you can find them and you can get the real deal and you don't have to
[34:21.750 --> 34:30.230]  um go to the dispensary and get you know bullshit or fucking just live in a world
[34:30.230 --> 34:37.590]  without these things because they're still out there yeah you know and Dave Dave is here hey Dave
[34:37.590 --> 34:43.110]  he's saying purple unicorn is pretty decent one that he has turned me on to and has actually put
[34:43.110 --> 34:49.430]  in my hands as well was the the old family purple I think t1000 or old family purple that came from
[34:49.430 --> 34:57.590]  the hills of Mendocino and I'm not exactly sure where that fits into the purple urkel GDP story
[34:57.590 --> 35:03.190]  or timeline but from what I understand it is kind of one of the possibly one of the base
[35:04.870 --> 35:12.070]  genetics up there I've lost great bape to time wish I hadn't I'm searching for a really good
[35:12.070 --> 35:19.910]  GDP for my wife medicinally that is a wonderful strain back the GDP was always my favorite until
[35:19.910 --> 35:27.830]  I tried this SR 71 but it's been so long since I smoked GDP or what I have had as GDP in Montana
[35:27.830 --> 35:35.750]  at the time right I'm hoping the one that I got coming is the same one yeah I have I have had some
[35:35.750 --> 35:44.710]  clones and I have tried some seeds since but no it's not been recreated or duplicated which you
[35:44.710 --> 35:51.990]  know that makes me wonder because a clone only technically should really originate from just
[35:51.990 --> 36:00.390]  one plant like one plant from like 30 years ago has been going around infinitely you know a thousand
[36:00.390 --> 36:06.790]  times a million times over cloned and passed around from that just one plant and you mentioned
[36:06.790 --> 36:15.430]  dudding earlier too which is a real thing but yeah over time I mean do you think we we may still have
[36:15.430 --> 36:22.870]  some of these clones but just time has changed them into something that they weren't before
[36:23.830 --> 36:26.630]  I've talked to different people like Mr. Bob
[36:27.670 --> 36:32.070]  Mr. Bob Tempel he holds lots of very old cuts and he talks about
[36:33.990 --> 36:39.990]  you know not necessarily dudding but something where they're just worn out and tired and they're
[36:39.990 --> 36:50.740]  not producing like they used to right I think that that is most likely a result of
[36:50.900 --> 37:00.020]  of dudding one way or another I don't know we've chimera Ryan Lee's been up and talked about it
[37:00.020 --> 37:09.700]  and he's definitely he's said that stuff he's kept for years and years hasn't drifted or
[37:09.700 --> 37:17.540]  changed in its expression I think the the technical term is genetic mosaicism so if your
[37:17.860 --> 37:19.220]  clones have
[37:22.020 --> 37:31.460]  variants snips that essentially are different from the original parent plant right that sort of
[37:31.460 --> 37:40.020]  genetic mutation that gets passed on in the clone while it may be present in important genes for
[37:40.980 --> 37:48.260]  different traits and expressions nobody's shown they've shown that this happens and that there is
[37:48.260 --> 37:58.100]  a certain mutation load in clones over time but they haven't shown what the cause of that is if
[37:58.100 --> 38:03.300]  it's an environmental reaction or like how the plants are maintained and whether or not that
[38:03.300 --> 38:09.140]  has an effect on it so they haven't like elucidated the underlying mechanism can't really explain it
[38:09.220 --> 38:15.540]  but the term is genetic mosaicism we used to call it genetic drift if you were on the forums back in
[38:15.540 --> 38:22.820]  the day it was always referred to as genetic drift but it's not clear that it necessarily
[38:23.540 --> 38:31.300]  changes the expression the phenotypic expression of the plants in a meaningful or measurable way
[38:31.780 --> 38:40.740]  um that still remains to be determined but viral load and particularly with hoplatin where it
[38:40.740 --> 38:46.740]  expresses in a number of different ways and can be latent and still be present these kinds of
[38:46.740 --> 38:55.540]  things make it so I think the plants that are showing significant quote-unquote drift
[38:56.020 --> 39:02.500]  um are probably just showing symptoms of gutting and that there's a high probability that they've
[39:02.500 --> 39:09.140]  gotten contaminated and they're just not expressing at their highest level um but then again
[39:09.140 --> 39:19.220]  keeping an annual plan around for 30 years or more is it's wild you know yeah definitely not not the
[39:19.300 --> 39:24.260]  way it's supposed to be but that that is interesting and I think we were on a show together
[39:25.460 --> 39:33.540]  somatic mutations with Christian Adamic wrote a paper um and exactly like you were saying it's
[39:33.540 --> 39:39.060]  you know there are just like little errors in copying sometime whether that is significant
[39:39.060 --> 39:45.700]  at the time there's you know who knows maybe yes maybe no could be both but yeah I do remember
[39:45.700 --> 39:52.820]  talking about that um with you and Christian Adamic this is A-D-A-M-E-X so if anybody wants
[39:52.820 --> 39:59.700]  to look that one up somatic mutations um because yeah you know the the genetic drift is something
[39:59.700 --> 40:05.300]  that I've always heard or you know been told about because I go from clone to clone to clone to clone
[40:05.300 --> 40:09.860]  I've never had the facility where I could keep multiple moms around it's all about managing
[40:09.860 --> 40:17.300]  numbers it's all about managing space so you know I've gone clone to clone uh seven years I think
[40:17.300 --> 40:24.900]  as long as I took a plant and in the end I think I did finally just get some dudding I haven't taken
[40:24.900 --> 40:33.460]  clones for a long time uh I took one clone in the last 10 years but I think I brought something in
[40:33.460 --> 40:40.820]  when when I got that oh god damn it I don't want to talk about it um so yeah that that does happen
[40:40.820 --> 40:45.540]  but is that something that you see dog days because you're running some you know clone
[40:45.540 --> 40:49.940]  onlys that have been around for a while and you've had the opportunity to run a few of them for
[40:50.660 --> 40:59.060]  multiple runs now you know do you see different expressions do you see like when it comes from
[40:59.060 --> 41:03.140]  somebody who's growing in a different environment you get it in your environment you grow it out the
[41:03.140 --> 41:09.220]  first run it does what it does the second run is it like adjusting do you see these little changes
[41:09.220 --> 41:15.300]  from run to run in these clones yeah um some of them like a lot of these older ones I haven't
[41:15.300 --> 41:22.020]  gotten a bunch of runs with them uh the SR-71 purple cush I have the one I can speak to this
[41:22.020 --> 41:27.620]  the most on would be the sour cut that I got from my grandma we got that in uh 2000 like December
[41:27.620 --> 41:33.780]  2011 right at the end of 2011 and then they've had it and like literally the they moved once
[41:33.780 --> 41:39.460]  so like it hasn't been in the same room but it's been in two rooms for that whole time until I got
[41:39.460 --> 41:45.860]  it from them and uh I noticed changes with it as soon as I brought it here once I got it into my
[41:45.860 --> 41:52.500]  bedroom they like they've still been using hps lights for flower and uh t8 fluorescent bulbs for
[41:53.300 --> 41:58.580]  and putting it under leds um running uh like a higher humidity I don't think they really he
[41:58.580 --> 42:03.620]  doesn't control its humidity and keep it uh he's not really messing with dpd or anything like that
[42:03.620 --> 42:09.060]  it's pretty dry and cold up there in Montana so uh I I don't know if it was a humidity but I
[42:09.060 --> 42:15.940]  noticed the leaves on my sour got like way fatter and then uh when I've drawn it out here uh the
[42:15.940 --> 42:21.300]  first run I did with it I grew a pretty big ass plant but the the buds were a little denser uh
[42:21.300 --> 42:27.380]  they had like a little more rounder shape they weren't quite as speared and foxtail but
[42:28.100 --> 42:33.460]  I think it could also be because I was under led lights and right there's a lot of environmental
[42:33.460 --> 42:40.260]  changes but I've seen I've seen changes due to the environment okay I can't speak too much on
[42:40.260 --> 42:45.780]  stuff like that though I'm still uh still learning a lot yeah well you know it too and then you know
[42:45.780 --> 42:49.140]  just just kind of what you've seen in your experience and that's you know everybody's
[42:49.140 --> 42:54.740]  experience will be different there's people have talked about some adjustment but you know at the
[42:54.740 --> 43:00.980]  end of the day we're all looking for that same profile really you know I tend to think a lot of
[43:00.980 --> 43:05.780]  clones back in the day and you know Trevor I'd definitely love to hear your input on this one
[43:05.780 --> 43:11.780]  but I think a lot of clones back in the day became those elite clones because they were more of like
[43:11.780 --> 43:18.980]  production workhorses I I don't necessarily think it was like today some of the clone only's are
[43:19.380 --> 43:26.500]  the shittiest producing plants you can ever imagine but the profile's so awesome like they're
[43:26.500 --> 43:32.180]  the best head stash but I don't think that would have flown back in you know the older day where
[43:33.540 --> 43:37.780]  you need weight like what what was the draw to some of these elite clones back then
[43:38.260 --> 43:44.900]  um I remember a number of older cats getting a hold of the OG for the first time and just being
[43:44.900 --> 43:48.260]  fuck this this little bitch
[43:50.660 --> 43:54.820]  you brought this up here and convinced us to replace all our shit with this
[43:56.340 --> 44:06.580]  and that really honestly I feel to a certain extent there was there was a higher echelon sort of
[44:07.540 --> 44:15.620]  there was a grower who was looking to appeal to the OG market or the purple market and wanted to
[44:15.620 --> 44:22.660]  do some high-end stuff and then there was blue green green crack UK cheese and a bunch of other
[44:22.660 --> 44:30.180]  things that just they got enormous they were easy to grow and you could get a 10 pound plant off of
[44:30.580 --> 44:37.140]  and you can do 99 plants and flood the market with blue green and that's what happened with
[44:37.860 --> 44:43.460]  that's why those plants in particular green crack blue green and UK cheese those three
[44:43.460 --> 44:51.620]  I remember and by like 08 those were the production plants if you you wanted to be doing big
[44:52.740 --> 44:56.260]  you know massive plants those were the ones you were going to use
[44:56.980 --> 45:03.380]  um yeah I know blue dream was just a hit because that thing was easy to grow it put out and it had
[45:03.380 --> 45:08.900]  a decent profile but that's actually kind of like coming late well later to the game some
[45:08.900 --> 45:12.980]  some of the things you'd be amazed how long they're actually around before they hit the
[45:12.980 --> 45:21.940]  the mainstream yeah blue dream was and I feel like all of those were the later part of the
[45:21.940 --> 45:33.780]  the aughts as it were so like 07 08 09 10 those were staples in the garden and yeah um yeah so it
[45:35.460 --> 45:41.220]  I definitely think that back in the day there was a bit more of a concern for production
[45:41.220 --> 45:50.100]  um chem d is just kind of wonk and produce this is my number one dude right there that's the chem d
[45:50.100 --> 45:59.540]  so I do have one and only that potency is under rivaled yeah yeah that's something um you know
[45:59.540 --> 46:09.220]  island weed island weed well I've smoked only time I've smoked real chem d is the couple times that
[46:09.220 --> 46:15.220]  I've met jj at uh at some cannabis events and uh he was kind enough to give me a couple grams the
[46:15.220 --> 46:21.060]  second time and I took some home and got got my wife stoned and I think an throws in the chat too
[46:21.060 --> 46:24.980]  and he could attest to it I smoked some with anthro and me and him were sitting in his truck
[46:24.980 --> 46:30.980]  dude and just like fucking sat there like in silence for like 30 minutes I feel like so high
[46:31.620 --> 46:37.300]  but uh I got this one in flower this is the one I got in flower right now and I just barely got
[46:37.300 --> 46:42.980]  the variegation to completely clear up on this clone like there is not a speck of there well
[46:42.980 --> 46:48.340]  looks like there might be a curled leaf but uh it's like I want in flower I'll go in the flower
[46:48.340 --> 46:53.860]  in a sec but it's like it's variegated and then the other one I have looks really similar there's
[46:53.860 --> 46:58.020]  a couple differences but it it looks more variegated so I'm gonna run them both out
[46:59.220 --> 47:05.380]  all right so what what condition are these things in when they get to you like what what is your
[47:05.940 --> 47:14.740]  standard procedure for oh I got a clone now what do you have any special like ipm that you do is
[47:14.740 --> 47:20.180]  there anything that you have to do to the roots are they already in soil like what what yeah what
[47:20.180 --> 47:26.900]  should people get them I like to get them honestly as snips like unrooted if like if I'm trading or
[47:26.900 --> 47:32.660]  like if I'm buying them unless I'm like at a buddy's house and he's giving me like a rooted cut
[47:32.660 --> 47:38.420]  I would prefer to get them as unrooted snips because I'm pretty decent at cloning I feel like
[47:38.420 --> 47:43.860]  you know knock on wood but uh you don't got to worry about having like pests in the root zone
[47:43.860 --> 47:48.260]  like root aphids I feel like with that like I'm not a pest expert so I could be completely wrong
[47:48.260 --> 47:54.340]  but I feel like there's less issues with pests and one uh a buddy gave me a tip that uh what he
[47:54.340 --> 47:59.060]  does is he'll put them in a dome and he'll close the dome up and just fucking blast them with
[47:59.060 --> 48:04.900]  humidity and like like see if they have pm basically like if you do that and if there's pm
[48:05.540 --> 48:10.100]  it'll show it like you know that's so that's a good way to see if there's shit on there um I'll
[48:10.100 --> 48:16.020]  do that but I'll I'll do I isolate them always uh I get them cloning I'll put them in their own dome
[48:16.020 --> 48:22.740]  um since learning about the viroids cloning is quite the process like I bleach everything all
[48:22.740 --> 48:29.140]  like I bleach all my domes after I use them uh I don't fill a dome completely full like I leave
[48:29.140 --> 48:34.340]  space between them so roots don't touch but uh yeah I like to I'll just keep them isolated I'll
[48:34.340 --> 48:39.940]  put them in a dome I have uh three three beds tents out here I got two four by fours and a
[48:39.940 --> 48:48.500]  four by five and then I got a cloning rack set up nice so I like I got tents so I can you know I
[48:48.500 --> 48:53.940]  can uh separate stuff that's incoming and a lot of times I'll just put a dome in my kitchen right
[48:53.940 --> 48:59.460]  under this little uh fluorescent light that I have in the kitchen it's a little t12 and I'll leave
[48:59.460 --> 49:05.460]  them under there for a while and I'll like I got a digital microscope I'll scope them and you gotta
[49:05.460 --> 49:11.220]  be vigilant and thankfully like I I've had some issues but it hasn't really been too bad nothing
[49:11.300 --> 49:19.060]  that I couldn't handle so right on and and Trevor like for outdoor gardeners like when you get
[49:19.060 --> 49:24.420]  clones is it do you typically just go straight into the ground outside or do you want to kind
[49:24.420 --> 49:29.380]  of keep that in somewhere covered and kind of baby it and get it rooted like what what is the process
[49:30.020 --> 49:37.220]  with getting clones there yeah so um the climatizing them is going to be important
[49:37.220 --> 49:44.740]  just on like that like once you've assured yourself that you're not dealing with something
[49:44.740 --> 49:52.340]  that's contaminated um once you can pull them out of quarantine you want to acclimatize everything
[49:52.340 --> 50:01.140]  and particularly where I'm at in NorCal it's pretty hot and dry so going from a clone to or
[50:01.220 --> 50:10.260]  indoor veg scene to like you know essentially here you have to be planting after mid-may
[50:10.980 --> 50:19.060]  with clones typically otherwise things will just start to flower immediately so typically with most
[50:19.060 --> 50:26.900]  plants you want to plant after may 15th and so you're going to be going into a pretty hot like
[50:27.460 --> 50:35.140]  that's the time when our region goes brown or golden essentially you know like I've been in
[50:35.140 --> 50:41.140]  Northern California man if you haven't done your weed eating by then then it's just going to be a
[50:41.140 --> 50:48.100]  stickery hell hole and really suck so like by may 4th you want to have all your weed eating done
[50:48.740 --> 50:55.460]  and by may 15th you can start to be putting most clones out some things will still you know start
[50:55.460 --> 51:02.660]  to turn and some people are strict about a later date and only want to plant like June 10th
[51:03.300 --> 51:12.260]  I've typically been fine planting in mid to late may and there you're just for us you want to spend
[51:12.260 --> 51:19.060]  most of may acclimatizing your plants and getting them so at whatever stage of growth they are
[51:19.060 --> 51:25.300]  they're spending the day out in the sun or in some shade getting some direct sunlight and then
[51:25.300 --> 51:31.940]  getting shaded sunlight and not getting like burnt but getting used to the feel of that hot dry sun
[51:31.940 --> 51:40.660]  that we have out here and um but yeah otherwise that's pretty much it's all the same like I I
[51:40.660 --> 51:50.900]  only have a few people I will be taking cuts from right speaking so I I don't have issues and if I
[51:50.900 --> 51:57.700]  do have issues they're always very like up front with me about whatever issue they've got and will
[51:57.700 --> 52:05.620]  let me know so I'm not I know what to look for and I haven't I haven't had too much problem I
[52:05.620 --> 52:11.380]  also don't keep things around personally long term because I don't have an indoor setup myself
[52:12.100 --> 52:20.180]  I can pop seeds but like I'm not really somebody who can keep something over the winter um so for
[52:20.180 --> 52:29.220]  me I have friends who keep my stuff on lock for me and help me when I go to them typically they
[52:29.380 --> 52:35.860]  get it back and that's that's been the way I've rolled and I appreciate every one of you
[52:36.580 --> 52:42.340]  yes yeah true true friends there to hold you know hold it sacred and also to keep it going
[52:42.900 --> 52:48.580]  uh I'm gonna blow you up here dog days give us give us maybe a little bit of tour and I want to
[52:48.580 --> 52:53.540]  see you know some of these things on some of these can you guys hear me yes we can hear you can you
[52:53.540 --> 52:58.100]  hear us okay sometimes the uh the mylar on these tents will fuck with my connection
[52:58.740 --> 53:05.940]  but each one of these is a different mom there's uh okay that's the mom room yeah I got like almost
[53:05.940 --> 53:10.260]  30 different moms right now but I got a bunch I got a lot of variegated plants I was going to show
[53:10.260 --> 53:16.420]  you like show you guys that I got yeah and I'm getting her to clear up she this plant was so
[53:17.060 --> 53:22.020]  variegated when I got it dude I've seen pictures of sour dub on the forums too like
[53:22.020 --> 53:28.020]  and I uh I've just I've gotten it to clear up pretty well sour dub sour dub what what is sour
[53:28.020 --> 53:34.660]  dub is it sour diesel back crossed or I don't know it's uh it looks it's from bog sour bubble
[53:34.660 --> 53:40.740]  Trevor would probably know let me hit I'll hit up c finder too or is it is it unknown what if
[53:40.740 --> 53:47.780]  there's a sour diesel or if it was one of resin's ibls it's unknown it's a weird one um there's a
[53:47.780 --> 53:54.500]  lot of uh I think graceville is the person who popped the scents and selected it and there's
[53:54.500 --> 54:01.300]  some posts by graceville about his back and forth with bog and then there's like post by bog and I
[54:01.300 --> 54:09.220]  know um okay I'm pretty sure hammerhead uh hammerhead genetics um made a post about it
[54:09.220 --> 54:14.420]  on icy mag and kind of collected some of the info but it's yeah it's a
[54:16.660 --> 54:24.020]  it's a classic clone only from fog's genetics so shout out fog I love your fear guys leafly
[54:24.020 --> 54:29.140]  knows the actual story and the truth they have it on their website a local colorado
[54:30.900 --> 54:35.860]  and he uh he smoked some of the flower with me when he gave it to me I'd never tried it
[54:35.860 --> 54:40.020]  but he was like dude you gotta try this I think you'll love it and uh it was it was really good
[54:40.020 --> 54:46.420]  flower so I'm excited to grow it now how how are you getting rid of irrigation because I've seen
[54:46.420 --> 54:51.940]  that you know I've had that on plants and sometimes it just uh okay I switched over to
[54:52.580 --> 54:58.420]  called like living soil natural whatever you want to call it I'm not bottle feeding anymore um
[54:59.380 --> 55:06.500]  I uh I'm using some aminos like I'll use some pure amino acids uh I'll add a little kelp I
[55:06.500 --> 55:13.140]  use like recharge and microbes and stuff I've brewed uh brewed a couple teas but I uh I make
[55:13.140 --> 55:18.260]  sure I don't get root bound that's kind of the key uh that's where I was failing before anyway
[55:18.260 --> 55:24.820]  when I was when I first switched over was I would leave plants in a cup or a one gallon for too long
[55:24.900 --> 55:30.260]  they get root bound and so I just got to keep transplanting uh it's a lot of work keeping all
[55:30.260 --> 55:34.340]  these moms because I got like 30 almost 30 I got 29 now and I got a couple more coming so I'll have
[55:34.340 --> 55:39.940]  over 30 but I do a lot of cloning I got this tip from listening to Bob Hemphill in an interview
[55:40.980 --> 55:47.140]  he said he clones every five to six weeks and I was like fuck dude that is so smart it's so much
[55:47.140 --> 55:55.300]  easier to like spray scout for bugs all the shit you need to do for keeping those happy it's so
[55:55.300 --> 56:01.220]  much easier to do when they're only this big so I can I can grab a plant I can pick it up spray the
[56:01.220 --> 56:08.100]  whole thing down set it down I can chop back up any water it's not a huge mess trying to spray down
[56:08.100 --> 56:13.220]  massive plants like the like the headband and shit that I got in there it's a pain in the ass
[56:13.220 --> 56:20.100]  and having like 30 plants that big yeah and so I keep everything small and I clone a lot like I
[56:21.700 --> 56:26.340]  I put them in a solo cup and like right now I'm deciding what I'm gonna flower because I still
[56:26.340 --> 56:31.700]  have a few things that are like barely new that I haven't flowered yet like the uh gold sod super
[56:31.700 --> 56:38.500]  silver haze I got another original diesel that I need to flower um but I I pick what I'm gonna
[56:38.500 --> 56:44.180]  flower and then I'll a pot from the one gallon whatever I'm not gonna flower for this round I'm
[56:44.180 --> 56:51.460]  just gonna clone them and uh reset them but I I don't toss them until I like have my new mother
[56:51.460 --> 56:56.740]  clone selected and I try to always take at least a couple of clones so I can select the healthiest
[56:56.740 --> 57:05.300]  one so yeah it's it's a lot of work uh I do it to smoke them like I have been making I have been
[57:05.300 --> 57:10.580]  getting into making seed um had some some help with by some some really cool people that I'm
[57:10.580 --> 57:16.500]  super grateful for and uh I just popped some of the first seeds I made uh I F2'd some of the
[57:16.500 --> 57:22.740]  sour super skunks that I got from JJ uh talked to him about it and stuff and he gave me the go ahead
[57:22.740 --> 57:27.780]  just told me not to sell them and not to be an asshole about it so that sounds like him that's
[57:28.020 --> 57:35.460]  fair enough dude fair enough like I I talked about F2 and his the stuff I got from him and
[57:35.460 --> 57:39.940]  someone I can't remember who it was but they're like oh he's gonna be so pissed I was like no man
[57:39.940 --> 57:44.820]  like not really just uh you know be honest and just state your intentions and they'll either say
[57:44.820 --> 57:50.020]  yes or no and thankfully he was super cool about it and I have no intention on selling them or
[57:50.020 --> 57:54.340]  really giving it like yeah I'm not really even doing it anyway I have not many I'm gonna pop
[57:54.340 --> 58:00.180]  them off but uh but yeah I like to smoke this weed really if something's not you know if it
[58:00.180 --> 58:05.700]  doesn't live up to what it's supposed to smoke like I'd probably get rid of it but so far every
[58:05.700 --> 58:11.780]  one of the cuts that I've flowered out lives up to its name and I can't get enough of it yeah
[58:11.780 --> 58:16.980]  well that kind of makes me makes me wonder too like you know Trevor what what is it
[58:17.540 --> 58:23.940]  what is it that makes you like keep them is it is it the profile or is it the output is it a
[58:23.940 --> 58:28.740]  like a pm resistance or maybe all of them like what is it to you because you've had a few and
[58:28.740 --> 58:36.980]  you've had more over the years what tends to be the deal I mean yeah with the the Kenton D
[58:37.700 --> 58:43.380]  the reason why I say it's island weed is you're stuck on an island that's definitely
[58:43.460 --> 58:52.660]  the one for me if not in the top and I feel like there's just certain things that are
[58:56.020 --> 59:02.740]  when I have them I go back to them and there'll be the thing that I just that I smoke over
[59:02.740 --> 59:11.060]  everything else that I have and so that that's how I it would happen every time I'd grow seed
[59:11.380 --> 59:17.460]  every time I'd grow seed from seed where I I have many different phenos that I'm looking at
[59:17.460 --> 59:23.220]  and there's some that I'm just this jar is the one that I'm going to go back to time and time again
[59:23.940 --> 59:31.620]  and they set themselves apart and the Ken D's that way it's its potency is unrivaled but it's
[59:31.700 --> 59:43.380]  also got a great flavor so the TK or the OG any classic OG speaking my language man yeah
[59:45.940 --> 59:54.740]  can be triangle cush sour just like that and all of those are like heavy kind of ass on the couch
[59:54.740 --> 01:00:01.380]  type heavy hitters for me that was a little better for daytime but like I'll just be straight up like
[01:00:01.620 --> 01:00:14.000]  this
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:14.980]  in jail
[01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:25.580]  tells
[01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:28.420]  really does and I feel like it does help.
[01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:29.500]  It helps me with sleep.
[01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:32.220]  That was a lot of the reason I've struggled with drugs
[01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:35.340]  and self-medicating in unhealthy ways.
[01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:36.180]  I have insomnia.
[01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:39.620]  I have my own reasons that I feel I need to self-medicate.
[01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:43.260]  And these just extremely heavy narcotic ones
[01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:46.500]  like Triangle Kush, Chem D,
[01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:50.820]  that SR-71 Purple Kush really is the best sleeping medicine
[01:00:50.820 --> 01:00:53.220]  I've ever found in my entire life.
[01:00:53.220 --> 01:00:56.180]  If I run that plan out to 63 days,
[01:00:56.180 --> 01:00:59.020]  it'll slump me in the middle of the day.
[01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:00.540]  Like I can't get shit done.
[01:01:00.540 --> 01:01:03.420]  This time I cut it at about 58, 59
[01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:05.700]  and it still will help me sleep at night,
[01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:07.780]  but I can smoke it in the day and enjoy it.
[01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:08.740]  It's 63 days.
[01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:11.500]  I couldn't even enjoy smoking it during the day.
[01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:12.340]  Wow. Yeah.
[01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:15.380]  I love those types of plants, man,
[01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:17.260]  that you do, that you come back to.
[01:01:17.260 --> 01:01:18.180]  Trevor was mentioning that.
[01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:21.060]  It's like the three that I always come back to in my drawer.
[01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:22.180]  Like I've got so many jars,
[01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:23.980]  but these are the three jars.
[01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:28.500]  We got the Pre-91 Chem, which is awesome.
[01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:30.020]  We got my Kool-Aid Man
[01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:31.460]  and then the Westport Grape Juice.
[01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:34.780]  But this is, these two,
[01:01:34.780 --> 01:01:37.380]  the Grape Juice and the Kool-Aid Man I grow,
[01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:39.300]  but this was actually a wreck buy
[01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:40.940]  and this company is out of business.
[01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:42.020]  And I cry every time
[01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:45.580]  because this is all I have left of my Pre-91 Chem.
[01:01:45.580 --> 01:01:47.900]  And it's funny because we're doing the Clone Collector Show
[01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:51.740]  and I've tried amassing a bunch of different seeds
[01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:53.700]  of Chems because I want to try to find this.
[01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:55.380]  I want to try to get it.
[01:01:56.260 --> 01:01:59.060]  I do have some Chem D seeds here.
[01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:01.820]  So it's interesting how I have seeds
[01:02:01.820 --> 01:02:03.620]  of something that's clone only.
[01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:06.740]  I mean, the natural way.
[01:02:08.020 --> 01:02:09.980]  Yeah. I mean, the natural way, you know,
[01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:10.820]  you can get to that.
[01:02:10.820 --> 01:02:12.380]  A lot of things are reversed.
[01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:16.420]  Yeah. The Pre-91, I have no idea what the Pre means,
[01:02:16.420 --> 01:02:19.740]  but I just read what the label says.
[01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:24.940]  But, ah, it totally sidetracked me too.
[01:02:25.900 --> 01:02:26.860]  Scott Gabe.
[01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:28.620]  Yes. What is Pre-91?
[01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:29.460]  I don't know, man.
[01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:30.300]  That's what it says.
[01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:34.980]  It said Pre-91, but it is the Chem that I remember.
[01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:38.140]  It nails everything from the effects
[01:02:38.140 --> 01:02:39.900]  to the taste, to the look.
[01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:43.100]  Like it is what I've been searching for.
[01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:46.420]  And I can't find it from any other company with a Chem-91,
[01:02:46.420 --> 01:02:49.540]  but that is what it is.
[01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:51.380]  Ah, yay. Purple Thumb to the rescue.
[01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:53.180]  What is Pre-91?
[01:02:53.180 --> 01:02:55.060]  It's before 1991.
[01:02:55.060 --> 01:02:55.900]  All right.
[01:02:55.900 --> 01:02:56.740]  Uh-oh.
[01:02:57.900 --> 01:02:59.780]  Trevor dropped out on that one.
[01:02:59.780 --> 01:03:01.540]  He's tired of my jokes.
[01:03:01.540 --> 01:03:03.180]  No, hopefully he'll be back here.
[01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:08.580]  But you know, one thing that you guys are going back for,
[01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:12.020]  or talking about going back and forth on,
[01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:17.020]  is the, like the Chem, and the Diesel, and the OG.
[01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:20.260]  And I've actually, since our last show,
[01:03:20.260 --> 01:03:23.100]  I have scored some new beans.
[01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:25.340]  This is from OneLove.
[01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:28.340]  And we actually, I actually had him on a show
[01:03:28.340 --> 01:03:29.300]  the other month.
[01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:31.420]  So that was a profile with him.
[01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:32.500]  Really freaky cool dude.
[01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:33.460]  You guys should check it out.
[01:03:33.460 --> 01:03:35.580]  Where we're, me and him, we could probably,
[01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:37.260]  we would have been really good friends.
[01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:40.740]  A lot of similarities, but we also like good weed.
[01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:41.820]  So that's another similarity.
[01:03:41.820 --> 01:03:46.060]  So Airhorn is one of the ones that he works with a lot.
[01:03:46.060 --> 01:03:49.100]  This is his Chem, Diesel, OG, times the Airhorn,
[01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:52.820]  because I love Chems, I love Diesels, I love OGs.
[01:03:52.820 --> 01:03:54.180]  I wanna see what this brings,
[01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:57.180]  because all three of those profiles, boo-yah.
[01:03:57.180 --> 01:03:58.980]  So I'm excited kind of about that one.
[01:03:58.980 --> 01:04:02.780]  And another one, bonus pack, that OneLove sent me,
[01:04:02.780 --> 01:04:06.540]  I picked up, is the Mean Mug times his Airhorn.
[01:04:06.540 --> 01:04:08.980]  And Mean Mug is, you know, something,
[01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:11.620]  gosh, I need to look it up again.
[01:04:11.620 --> 01:04:13.540]  But you know, it's working with that Root Beer,
[01:04:13.540 --> 01:04:15.340]  the Mean Gene deal.
[01:04:15.340 --> 01:04:16.820]  So that's something that we kind of,
[01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:18.100]  or Dave has talked about.
[01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:19.380]  Dave is the Root Beer king.
[01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:22.620]  Like he's, A&W is a shame to themselves
[01:04:22.620 --> 01:04:25.020]  when they talk about Root Beer next to Dave.
[01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:28.300]  I'll look up what the cross on this one is,
[01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:29.900]  but I just wanted to get a chance
[01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:31.860]  to show a little something right now, real quick.
[01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:33.900]  Couple of packs from OneLove I picked up
[01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:37.860]  since the last Seed Collectors episode,
[01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:40.700]  even though we're doing the Clone Collectors right now.
[01:04:40.700 --> 01:04:42.860]  That was a cool episode, I liked that one.
[01:04:42.860 --> 01:04:43.700]  Thank you, yes.
[01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:47.100]  Found me another cool local person in Colorado.
[01:04:47.100 --> 01:04:47.940]  Yeah.
[01:04:47.940 --> 01:04:48.780]  There's a lot of people out here, man.
[01:04:48.780 --> 01:04:49.820]  There's a pretty cool scene.
[01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:52.020]  I've been starting to meet some more people.
[01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:53.620]  Pretty grateful.
[01:04:53.620 --> 01:04:54.460]  Yeah.
[01:04:54.460 --> 01:04:55.660]  Yeah, I'd love to run his genetics.
[01:04:55.660 --> 01:04:56.780]  Yeah, right on.
[01:04:56.780 --> 01:04:58.220]  Thanks for making it back.
[01:04:58.220 --> 01:05:02.580]  I know my jokes are bad sometimes, but what can you do?
[01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:05.420]  I told him to Tommy Chong and he hung out for a while, so.
[01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:09.100]  Dude, that is super awesome.
[01:05:09.100 --> 01:05:11.060]  The Dope History.
[01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:11.900]  Thank you.
[01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:14.780]  Shout out you and everybody doing Dope History.
[01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:15.940]  Oh yeah, thank you, dude.
[01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:18.100]  That's stoked.
[01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:23.100]  Yes, we'll talk soon, but again, it's fun to go back.
[01:05:24.860 --> 01:05:26.860]  Okay, so Wolf Siegel.
[01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:29.620]  Some people know him, Farmer in the Sky.
[01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:30.940]  Some other people don't know him
[01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:35.940]  because he was in jail from, I think, like 89 to 2005,
[01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:39.980]  or basically when the cannabis kind of took off,
[01:05:39.980 --> 01:05:40.820]  he was in jail.
[01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:44.420]  But anyways, the point of my story is we're talking with him
[01:05:44.460 --> 01:05:47.020]  about his childhood and how he got started.
[01:05:47.020 --> 01:05:52.020]  And he was slaying weed early, preteen, as teenager
[01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:57.020]  on the exact same street that I used to sell weed on
[01:05:57.060 --> 01:05:59.180]  when I was a teenager.
[01:05:59.180 --> 01:06:02.460]  The University District, the Ave, man, UW.
[01:06:02.460 --> 01:06:05.180]  So he's talking about, I'm listening,
[01:06:05.180 --> 01:06:08.820]  he's talking about selling a sack on the Ave in 69.
[01:06:08.820 --> 01:06:10.780]  I'm like, what?
[01:06:10.780 --> 01:06:12.300]  Get the fuck out of here.
[01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:15.660]  I was like, maybe 30 years after you, but.
[01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:19.020]  So thank you, man.
[01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:20.820]  Doing some of these episodes is really fun.
[01:06:20.820 --> 01:06:22.260]  And that was a fun one because, dude,
[01:06:22.260 --> 01:06:25.180]  a lot of these places he mentioned, so I'm like,
[01:06:25.180 --> 01:06:26.500]  I know that.
[01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:28.820]  Oh my God, I know that.
[01:06:28.820 --> 01:06:31.860]  Yeah, so getting to talk to some of these people
[01:06:31.860 --> 01:06:32.980]  is pretty fun.
[01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:35.900]  And clone only really is a way of preserving
[01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:37.940]  that same history.
[01:06:37.940 --> 01:06:40.140]  The Salmon Creek Big Bud is something you talked about.
[01:06:40.180 --> 01:06:43.980]  From what I know is that's just kind of like a Big Bud
[01:06:43.980 --> 01:06:46.820]  back cross or Big Bud times Big Bud.
[01:06:46.820 --> 01:06:49.340]  But Big Bud, I can't remember the last time I heard
[01:06:49.340 --> 01:06:51.540]  or saw that in the store.
[01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:55.260]  Yeah, so Jimmy Myers is definitely the person to talk to
[01:06:55.260 --> 01:06:56.220]  on that one.
[01:06:56.220 --> 01:06:57.500]  Myers Creek Cannabis?
[01:06:57.500 --> 01:06:59.140]  Yeah, Myers Creek Cannabis.
[01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:04.140]  He knows about some of that and also GDP.
[01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:07.300]  He knows a lot about that backstory and history
[01:07:07.340 --> 01:07:11.660]  and the third floor and how, just yeah,
[01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:13.300]  how all that came about.
[01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:15.780]  And, but yeah, as far as I know,
[01:07:15.780 --> 01:07:18.700]  that's no longer around.
[01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:19.540]  Right.
[01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:21.100]  Salmon Creek Big Bud's gone.
[01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:22.060]  Yeah, well, that's cool.
[01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:22.900]  I'm glad you mentioned it.
[01:07:22.900 --> 01:07:25.460]  Cause I'm actually, I'm testing some of his Lemon Degreaser.
[01:07:25.460 --> 01:07:28.420]  Oh God, that's a Segway and a fricking half
[01:07:28.420 --> 01:07:31.060]  if I didn't just call it out loud.
[01:07:31.060 --> 01:07:34.340]  Lemon Degreaser, that's another pack that I picked up
[01:07:34.340 --> 01:07:35.820]  since the last show.
[01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:37.900]  And this is, this is from Myers Creek.
[01:07:37.900 --> 01:07:42.220]  He said, we've got a tester group going on right now
[01:07:42.220 --> 01:07:43.060]  with FCP.
[01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:45.660]  So the Myers Creek, you can check them out.
[01:07:45.660 --> 01:07:48.140]  He's up on Dega, but yeah, Lemon Degreaser.
[01:07:48.140 --> 01:07:51.380]  So next tester show we have,
[01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:54.380]  I might try to pry some GDP information out of them
[01:07:54.380 --> 01:07:56.860]  cause I love that strain.
[01:07:56.860 --> 01:07:59.340]  So thank you for mentioning that.
[01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:00.180]  Yeah.
[01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:01.260]  And giving me a Segway.
[01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:05.860]  He gave me some of the, his Lemon Crosses
[01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:08.800]  and I don't know where they are.
[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:10.540]  I have many piles.
[01:08:10.540 --> 01:08:13.580]  I pulled out my, like a portion of my seeds
[01:08:13.580 --> 01:08:18.100]  just to come on and it's so, it's chaos.
[01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:19.660]  That's okay.
[01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:21.580]  But I did, where is it?
[01:08:21.580 --> 01:08:22.620]  There we go.
[01:08:22.620 --> 01:08:23.460]  There we go.
[01:08:23.460 --> 01:08:25.460]  Yeah, he's got cool, cool labels.
[01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:26.300]  Yeah.
[01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:31.300]  So that's the Super Silver Haze Cross to the TKM10.
[01:08:31.780 --> 01:08:35.260]  And so he did a selection from the TKM10.
[01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:38.020]  I've done a selection from the TKM10
[01:08:38.020 --> 01:08:39.860]  on the male side breeding with it.
[01:08:41.180 --> 01:08:44.820]  I know Swamp Boys made a selection with that.
[01:08:44.820 --> 01:08:49.820]  And I believe ITOL Foundation made a selection with that.
[01:08:50.580 --> 01:08:54.340]  And needless to say, a lot of people have bred
[01:08:54.340 --> 01:08:57.940]  with the TKM10 and Jimmy's work's fire.
[01:08:57.940 --> 01:09:02.020]  I've seen the OG Back Cross that was made
[01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:04.840]  with his TKM10 grown out in Oklahoma.
[01:09:05.940 --> 01:09:09.300]  And I'm excited to pop these.
[01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:13.700]  Super Silver Haze Cross to it is gonna be interesting.
[01:09:15.540 --> 01:09:17.700]  There I'd like to see which of these two
[01:09:17.700 --> 01:09:22.220]  like overbearing plants dominates the cross.
[01:09:22.220 --> 01:09:26.380]  Is it gonna be hazy or is it gonna be TKM10?
[01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:28.100]  Which is really M10.
[01:09:29.620 --> 01:09:31.980]  And that's, you know, that is kind of a huge benefit
[01:09:31.980 --> 01:09:35.500]  of growing plants out, having the parents
[01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:36.940]  or being familiar with them.
[01:09:36.940 --> 01:09:39.420]  You know, it just kind of goes back to breeding too
[01:09:39.420 --> 01:09:42.140]  of just like be familiar with your plants.
[01:09:42.140 --> 01:09:44.460]  So when you do get those offsprings, you're like, oh,
[01:09:44.460 --> 01:09:46.140]  this one's leaning that way.
[01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:49.260]  And that is ultimately gonna help your selection.
[01:09:49.260 --> 01:09:51.600]  But that's kind of the fun too.
[01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:53.360]  You're like, what's it gonna be?
[01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:55.160]  It's the roll of the dice.
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:56.640]  It's gonna be good, right?
[01:09:56.640 --> 01:09:59.600]  Yeah, yeah, no, I like doing,
[01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:04.600]  so we grew out, I think,
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:08.260]  five different Pina hash plant crosses that we made.
[01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:10.440]  So Pina hash plant was the cross.
[01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:14.400]  It was Jackson's Pina hash plant, or excuse me,
[01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:19.400]  Pina F3, I believe, cross to the Indian guy.
[01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:24.400]  This one, the 88G13 hash plant from,
[01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:30.400]  that's from Farmer Joe,
[01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:33.280]  but it came from Indian guy seed stock.
[01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:37.180]  And yeah, and that, those crosses,
[01:10:37.180 --> 01:10:40.360]  the Pina hash plant is legit.
[01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:43.680]  Like the Pina just completely dominates.
[01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:48.680]  And we crossed it to Oreos, Donny Burger,
[01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:52.920]  Watermelon Z, a whole bunch of hype shit, honestly.
[01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:55.760]  And it's dope.
[01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:58.080]  The Pina comes through in everything.
[01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:01.760]  And you get like pineapple, like hybrids of every,
[01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:06.480]  we called it pineapple butt melon
[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:10.320]  because the Donny Burger smells like some gnarly funk
[01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:12.320]  and like sweet pineapples.
[01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:17.680]  And then the Oreos has some terrible,
[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:21.480]  just absolute reggie, really bad Pinas.
[01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:23.040]  There's a couple of them.
[01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:24.400]  You know, we grew out about,
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:28.200]  my homie grew out about 500 plants of it.
[01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:33.200]  And you know, there's a subsection of the population
[01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:37.440]  that's not great, but then the ones that hit
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:42.040]  are like Oreos, but they've got pineapple turps.
[01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:46.680]  So you get that structure, that frost, that purple,
[01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:50.440]  all the good characteristics that you get from Oreos,
[01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:52.480]  but it's got some actual turps
[01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:54.840]  as opposed to tasting like cardboard.
[01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:56.880]  That's, that would be a good one.
[01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:57.960]  That sounds interesting.
[01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:01.000]  And you, I actually, I wish I had all of my beans
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:01.840]  with me today.
[01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:02.880]  I just kind of have some new stuff,
[01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:07.880]  but I have one, a Pina G13 hash plant times,
[01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:12.880]  I think it was like a pineapple upside down cake.
[01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:18.760]  It came secondhand to me from Rasufa
[01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:21.680]  who picked it up from you at a,
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:29.000]  oh God, the Emerald Cup the year before.
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:29.920]  Yep. Yeah.
[01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:34.920]  Yeah. So I, at Emerald Cup and Ego Clash
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:38.480]  a year or two ago or whenever,
[01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:40.760]  not this last one, but the one before.
[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:43.520]  I had some of those hybrids with me,
[01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:45.640]  not very much, but a few,
[01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:47.400]  and I definitely was handing them out.
[01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:48.920]  So that's dope that you got some.
[01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:49.760]  Nice. Yeah.
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:51.040]  Yeah. I was excited to do that.
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:54.360]  That one, I put that one to the side, especially.
[01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:57.600]  He sent me a couple, but then shortly after that,
[01:12:57.600 --> 01:12:59.200]  he also sent out like the email of like,
[01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:01.440]  don't run this pack, there were herbs.
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:02.840]  And so I'm just like,
[01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:04.920]  we're putting Trevor's pack in this box.
[01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:07.080]  We're putting these other ones in this box.
[01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:10.680]  Yeah. Got that one set to the side.
[01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:14.800]  Cause G13 has gotta be one of the most classic,
[01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:18.680]  like fabled, storied, clone only strains out there.
[01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:19.520]  So yeah, G13.
[01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:23.440]  So G13, that's the one that supposedly escaped
[01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:26.800]  the Mississippi trial program.
[01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:29.920]  I've always heard it as there was this U-dub strain
[01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:31.200]  that was a break in.
[01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:32.160]  And I thought that was the G13.
[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:34.680]  Well, there's the Pacific G13 I heard about
[01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:35.880]  that comes from Washington.
[01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:38.120]  And I think it's from someone that had a handle
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:40.400]  on the forums that went by Pacific.
[01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:41.680]  Okay.
[01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:43.360]  There's like the airborne G13
[01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:45.720]  that I'm hopefully gonna be trying soon.
[01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:48.000]  This one I got from Farmer Joe 420.
[01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:49.800]  It's really good.
[01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:53.560]  I don't know if you are familiar with his G13 cut, Trevor.
[01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:55.520]  I was describing someone,
[01:13:57.080 --> 01:13:59.360]  a person I was describing it to said that they think
[01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:02.960]  it's possible it could be the SoCal G13.
[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:05.760]  Like I'm not, I don't wanna like make that claim at all.
[01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:06.600]  That's not what I'm saying.
[01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:08.640]  That's just the closest thing.
[01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:11.600]  I'm looking for that SoCal G13 now.
[01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:12.680]  I don't know too much about it.
[01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:14.680]  I've read about it a little bit on the forums
[01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:16.800]  and it's in the Cannabible actually.
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:19.120]  I think it's in the second or third volume.
[01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:20.680]  I have the Cannabible set.
[01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:23.800]  They have the Trichome Technologies G13 in there.
[01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:25.680]  And it's not a pure G13.
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:28.120]  They're probably some kind of G13 hybrid
[01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:29.280]  from the seed bank release.
[01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:31.440]  But whatever this one is, is really good.
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:33.520]  And then I've heard that the Airborne
[01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:35.520]  is also really, really good.
[01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:38.400]  And that one's supposed to be a G13 NL, I believe.
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:42.240]  I think, is it Duke Diamond that works with that one a lot?
[01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:44.080]  Yeah. G13 Airborne?
[01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:44.920]  Okay.
[01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:47.320]  He works with the 88 G13 hash plant too,
[01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:49.080]  one of the old clones of it.
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:50.840]  Okay.
[01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:53.920]  You know, God, now that, I mean, that makes me wonder
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:56.240]  like how many G13s are there out there?
[01:14:56.280 --> 01:15:01.280]  How many college laboratories did it escape from?
[01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:04.960]  I think it was Mr. Bob Hemphill that talked about it.
[01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:06.240]  Sorry, go ahead, Trevor.
[01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:07.080]  Oh no.
[01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:11.000]  I mean, there's that story that's just kind of, you know.
[01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:15.160]  I think it's fair to say Neville made up a story
[01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:18.440]  and put it in one of the seed bank catalogs
[01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:22.520]  and use that as a selling point for, you know,
[01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:24.880]  creating a mythology around a plant.
[01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:29.440]  Cause Neville crossed it with the hay,
[01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:30.720]  or the original haze.
[01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:34.560]  And that's the G13 haze that was kind of like.
[01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:36.400]  That happened later, I believe.
[01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:40.360]  But that's definitely, he did make that cross
[01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:45.000]  and that cross went to, I know Soma got ahold of those
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:48.400]  and selected a male and that male kind of became
[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:55.080]  a huge portion of the population of Amsterdam crosses
[01:15:55.400 --> 01:16:00.400]  from probably about late 90s to the early 2000s.
[01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:04.240]  Tons of things were made with that male.
[01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:05.080]  But-
[01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:07.520]  Did you hear the hash cake patty story?
[01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:08.360]  What's that?
[01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:11.640]  Did you hear the hash cake patty story?
[01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:15.000]  I heard Bob Hemphill say it in a couple of interviews
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:19.680]  of like a possible G13 origin, but it was like a hash.
[01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:21.400]  I think I could be quoting it wrong,
[01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:22.920]  but I think it was a seed that was picked out
[01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:27.480]  of a brick of hash and the hash was like flat or something.
[01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:29.800]  That's why they called her hash cake patty.
[01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:33.760]  And don't quote me on this, but this is just my memory.
[01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:35.120]  But yeah, that was something.
[01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:37.320]  I think he heard it from CogU and I remember hearing that.
[01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:38.720]  I thought it was like super interesting,
[01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:40.920]  but I couldn't find any, like anything about that
[01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:42.840]  when I started like digging,
[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:44.480]  searching keywords in the forums.
[01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:46.320]  But I thought it was really interesting
[01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:48.960]  cause I'd never heard that from anywhere else before.
[01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:50.760]  And that's like the fun thing.
[01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:51.840]  That's what I, and Trevor,
[01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:54.440]  I definitely want to hear your take on this one.
[01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:56.440]  Cause you know, again, this is fascinating.
[01:16:56.440 --> 01:17:00.800]  It's fun to me because so Lemon Hoko is a breeder
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:03.760]  and a person up here in the Pacific Northwest.
[01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:05.240]  He's a little bit older than me.
[01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:07.900]  He was involved for a lot longer than me,
[01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:13.380]  but we had talked about this particular U-dub strain
[01:17:13.380 --> 01:17:14.680]  at one point.
[01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:17.680]  And that's when I realized like me and him
[01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:20.800]  were probably like one degree separated this entire time.
[01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:25.840]  But the story he tells lined up so like perfectly
[01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:29.120]  with the story that I remember and that I was told
[01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:30.880]  that really isn't all that public.
[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:33.840]  Like it was kind of eerie, like to hear somebody
[01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:35.080]  I've never talked to about it,
[01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:36.840]  say the same things back to me,
[01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:39.560]  but at the same time,
[01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:41.880]  cause there was some really killer stuff.
[01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:43.880]  And like the, it was probably the late nineties
[01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:45.140]  that hit the streets here.
[01:17:45.140 --> 01:17:46.920]  And like, you wanted that.
[01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:50.280]  Like you were like giving your money up ahead of time,
[01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:52.200]  hoping your guy would get some
[01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:53.760]  and then they would break it off to you
[01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:56.140]  and give you what you could get.
[01:17:56.140 --> 01:17:58.560]  Like there was definitely something
[01:17:58.560 --> 01:17:59.760]  and the stories lined up,
[01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:03.640]  but you had something to add to that one too.
[01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:06.200]  Cause again, it's all fun lore,
[01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:09.040]  but what were you gonna add into that one there, Trevor?
[01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:14.960]  Yeah, like, I mean,
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:16.960]  there's lots of different stories with it.
[01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:18.520]  It's one of those,
[01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:24.460]  G13's been one of the most sought after
[01:18:24.460 --> 01:18:28.800]  and legendary sort of mythologized plants around,
[01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:31.160]  partly because of the initial story.
[01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:36.480]  There are a lot of subsequent theories
[01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:41.480]  or like, you know, different regional variants on stories.
[01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:46.960]  Cause like KU and Mr. Bob Hemphill,
[01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:50.400]  that's a very Santa Cruz based situation,
[01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:54.520]  but they, dude was collecting seeds in that time period,
[01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:57.840]  in real time when these things were getting released.
[01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:01.640]  And it wasn't, in the eighties,
[01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:04.840]  it wasn't the same scene that it is today.
[01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:07.240]  There wasn't as many people doing it.
[01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:09.640]  And to the extent that you had a network
[01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:12.440]  and a community of people who were doing things,
[01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:18.520]  if you were a real enthusiast about all of this stuff,
[01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:20.760]  it was no different than it is now,
[01:19:20.760 --> 01:19:22.720]  but there were just fewer people doing it.
[01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:26.200]  So there were fewer people going really deep, really hard.
[01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:27.880]  And KU was one of those people,
[01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:29.720]  and he was friends with people like that,
[01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:31.640]  but they were Santa Cruz based.
[01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:33.900]  And then there are other people in other areas
[01:19:33.900 --> 01:19:35.720]  that they maybe were connected with
[01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:37.920]  or completely disconnected with.
[01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:42.920]  And very clearly there's a hub up in the Pacific Northwest
[01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:49.560]  that is essential to essentially all of this story.
[01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:52.120]  There's the California element to the story
[01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:54.480]  of early cannabis breeding
[01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:57.880]  and what ended up getting exported out to Amsterdam,
[01:19:57.880 --> 01:20:01.160]  largely through David Watson, Robert Clark,
[01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:03.240]  and folks like that.
[01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:06.360]  Then there's like the Pacific Northwest cats.
[01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:08.560]  And the Pacific Northwest cats were the people
[01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:09.600]  who really kind of,
[01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:13.600]  they were the forerunners for indoor.
[01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:15.960]  And they bred the Northern,
[01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:18.880]  Murphy Stevens, Jorge Cervantes,
[01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:20.160]  different people like this,
[01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:22.680]  they were all connected with different grow stores
[01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:23.840]  and there were different breeders
[01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:25.560]  who were doing different things.
[01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:28.040]  And that's where the hash plant came from.
[01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:31.440]  That's where the Northern Lights came from.
[01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:33.560]  It's where a whole bunch of these different plants,
[01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:37.840]  either out of the Seattle area or the Portland area,
[01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:40.640]  ended up getting into Neville's possession
[01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:45.640]  and forming the basis of essentially all the classic Gannies.
[01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:48.800]  Like when we talked about those heavy sedative,
[01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:50.320]  opiate type highs,
[01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:54.200]  there are some that are, it's its lane.
[01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:56.840]  And I'm this year, unfortunately,
[01:20:56.840 --> 01:20:59.960]  or fortunately, however you wanna put it,
[01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:02.280]  I went into a different lane primarily.
[01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:04.440]  And so I've got these super anxious,
[01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:08.480]  feeby, racy African sativas that are fucking me up.
[01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:12.280]  And only a very little bit of puck,
[01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:14.000]  not nearly enough puck.
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:17.320]  And so, cause I washed, I froze almost all of the puck
[01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:20.440]  cause it was better for those purposes.
[01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:25.240]  But yeah, I feel like there's a place for those,
[01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:30.000]  those sedative, heavy, lethargic, warm blanket kinda,
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:34.520]  you know, herb that just feels like fall and winter
[01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:36.520]  going and being by the fire, you know,
[01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:38.160]  like let's hunker down.
[01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:40.400]  It feels like grunge music.
[01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:41.240]  Yeah.
[01:21:41.240 --> 01:21:42.600]  Which Seattle also produced.
[01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:47.200]  Yeah, there's, and there's a lot of different plants
[01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:50.840]  that came from there that formed the basis
[01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:55.840]  of those deep, heavy Gannies that are really, you know,
[01:21:56.840 --> 01:22:00.200]  from the puck to the 88 G13 ash plant,
[01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:02.160]  to all those different things.
[01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:04.800]  They all have their origin in plants
[01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:06.720]  that came from that region.
[01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:11.160]  And from a, you know, a subset of people
[01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:15.360]  who are all in one way or another kind of loosely connected.
[01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:17.800]  And so, yeah.
[01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:18.640]  Yeah.
[01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:20.040]  One thing that throws me about the, you know,
[01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:22.680]  like the Afghanis and some of those strains is
[01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:27.440]  that was just kind of a generic term almost, you know,
[01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:31.160]  like for like Black Domino, it's just the Afghani
[01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:34.820]  or, you know, critical, oh, it's Afghani, Afghanica.
[01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:41.400]  So when we, there's a lot of Afghanis out there,
[01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:42.720]  a lot of clones out there.
[01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:45.680]  Like, how do you kind of differentiate, you know,
[01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:47.320]  like you mentioned puck,
[01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:48.980]  cause puck comes with a name though,
[01:22:48.980 --> 01:22:50.660]  but is there a morphology
[01:22:50.660 --> 01:22:55.020]  that helps people differentiate some of these?
[01:22:55.020 --> 01:22:57.700]  And are you able to like track it down?
[01:22:58.820 --> 01:23:02.340]  Yeah, for people who know it, but you know,
[01:23:02.340 --> 01:23:04.180]  you have to do the due diligence.
[01:23:04.180 --> 01:23:07.500]  You have to go find the forum posts
[01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:10.660]  of the people who originally brought things online.
[01:23:10.660 --> 01:23:12.100]  You have to look at the plants
[01:23:12.100 --> 01:23:15.400]  that they are presenting as the things.
[01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:19.640]  You can do it later on, but ideally you wanna go
[01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:23.240]  to the original source and the introduction of these things.
[01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:26.520]  And to the extent that you can, unfortunately,
[01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:31.520]  there's a, you know, overgrows not really accessible.
[01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:35.000]  A lot of the different forums aren't that accessible,
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.440]  but what you can find out there,
[01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:43.240]  one thing I do on forums is I'll go into a forum
[01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:48.240]  and I just go to the very last page and dart my way back.
[01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:50.520]  Oh, wow.
[01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:55.520]  And so whatever subject it is that I'm going in on
[01:23:56.400 --> 01:24:00.240]  and like looking at, that's how I'll typically do it.
[01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:05.240]  And so that's how you find what's still out there.
[01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:10.640]  And cause a lot of stuff got reposted and cross posted
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:17.120]  from different forums and you can find stuff way back,
[01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:21.080]  you know, from deck or unit.
[01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:21.920]  What is it?
[01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:26.920]  I think 2010 is as far back as you can get on IcyMag,
[01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:32.640]  at least on the mobile app right now when I go back.
[01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:35.360]  But like there are certain ways you can get
[01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:38.600]  a little bit further back to like 08 or 06.
[01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:43.280]  I've gone back to like, I think 06 and 05 is the oldest.
[01:24:43.280 --> 01:24:46.720]  It used to be, I used to be able to do all kinds of shit
[01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:49.240]  on IcyMag and go all the way back.
[01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:51.120]  I don't know what happened when they updated it.
[01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:52.480]  When did they start it?
[01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:53.560]  Do you know?
[01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:55.040]  I think 04.
[01:24:55.040 --> 01:24:56.560]  Okay.
[01:24:56.560 --> 01:24:59.880]  I think I have maybe seen a couple that were from 04,
[01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:01.520]  but I might have.
[01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:05.120]  I've been digging through there the last couple of months
[01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:06.080]  and I've been trying to figure out
[01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:07.840]  how to use their search engine better
[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:09.520]  and it's been pretty cool.
[01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:14.680]  Do you think it's been since 2015 in California
[01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:19.160]  that people were more likely to chronicle
[01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:21.520]  some of these origins or, you know,
[01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:23.520]  cause origins sometimes are unintentional.
[01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:25.800]  It's just a person working with a cross
[01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:28.100]  and then coming up with this and selecting it.
[01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:32.560]  Does it go back even further than that?
[01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:34.960]  Cause you know, again, the internet plays into it,
[01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:39.320]  but I feel even like, you know, Overgrow and IcyMag.
[01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:41.760]  Yeah, it was in the days of quasi legal,
[01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:43.400]  not everybody was in California,
[01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:48.400]  but did 2015 kind of like accelerate the documentation maybe?
[01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:53.240]  I think it created a false sense of security for people.
[01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:55.040]  Okay, good way of putting it.
[01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:56.600]  Yeah.
[01:25:56.600 --> 01:26:00.760]  That was one thing that like 2015 from the beginning
[01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:03.880]  was never what people thought it was.
[01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:07.920]  People thought it was this like right to grow weed
[01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:09.600]  or something and it was never that.
[01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:11.240]  It was just the right to go to court
[01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:13.440]  and use it as a defense in court.
[01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:14.720]  That's really all it was.
[01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:19.240]  Even Prop 215 just made it so you could bring that
[01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:22.280]  as a defense in court and you could say,
[01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:24.720]  hey, I'm following the things that they've said
[01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:29.720]  in the proposition so I can do this for medical purposes.
[01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:32.000]  And the jury could hear that.
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.360]  And when juries heard that they acquitted people
[01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:36.480]  by and large or the, you know,
[01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:39.800]  there were a lot of good early precedents set for us
[01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:42.960]  that allowed people to then just run with it and go wild.
[01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:47.960]  But digression, I feel like really the internet created,
[01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:52.880]  there was an early effort by people on the internet
[01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:55.520]  to figure this stuff out.
[01:26:55.520 --> 01:27:00.520]  Baudelaire is a good person who he did the strain guide
[01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:04.360]  and there used to be a version on Overgrow
[01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:07.960]  that was essentially a database and it was searchable.
[01:27:07.960 --> 01:27:10.480]  It had a lot more functionality to it.
[01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:15.480]  There are Word document versions like PDFs of it
[01:27:15.520 --> 01:27:17.440]  that still exist on different places.
[01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:19.820]  I think you can find it on the new Overgrow.
[01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:26.880]  But that was an effort, an early effort by somebody
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:29.920]  to compile all the information
[01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:34.160]  on different cultivars out there that had been grown out
[01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:38.480]  and essentially test grown by different people
[01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:42.240]  in the community and documented and include those
[01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:46.160]  in a guide that gives you all the different, you know,
[01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:50.560]  here's NL5 whatever from Sensi seeds
[01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:54.440]  and all the different things that were available
[01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:56.200]  at that time period.
[01:27:56.200 --> 01:28:01.200]  And so that effort, I feel like the Cannabival
[01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:04.720]  got mentioned earlier.
[01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:08.560]  The Cannabival was something particularly the first one
[01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:13.560]  with the introduction by Rob Clark, which has what is,
[01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:17.960]  I mean, it's essentially an effort to name
[01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:22.320]  every different variety or cultivar
[01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:26.740]  that had been introduced into the Amsterdam scene
[01:28:26.740 --> 01:28:30.040]  and document the different hybrids
[01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:33.120]  and what had been produced over the years
[01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:37.640]  by all the different seed companies up until the late 90s.
[01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:42.640]  And so that, yeah, that documentation sort of effort
[01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:45.520]  has been a community effort.
[01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:49.480]  And it's really interesting if you look at the way
[01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:53.240]  that the cannabis industry or not industry community,
[01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:58.240]  particularly in this context has organically adopted
[01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:05.920]  or tried to elaborate mechanisms that are similar
[01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:10.920]  to those that exist in the international cultivation,
[01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:16.120]  the ICNCP, which is the international code
[01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:18.480]  for nomenclature of cultivated plants.
[01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:21.720]  They essentially come up with the rules
[01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:24.040]  for how you name a cultivated plant.
[01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:31.240]  We essentially allow, we use the wrong nomenclature.
[01:29:31.280 --> 01:29:33.280]  We don't use the right terms.
[01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:35.200]  We're cannabis, man.
[01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:39.440]  But we do nevertheless use a lot of the same methods.
[01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:44.440]  And so the, you know, ascribing a name to a cut
[01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:50.440]  and being like, this is this, whatever it is,
[01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:54.160]  this clone only, and then it gets eventually
[01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:58.400]  a name ascribed to it because over time,
[01:29:58.400 --> 01:30:00.600]  there's now seven or eight different cuts
[01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:01.880]  that are floating around.
[01:30:02.720 --> 01:30:04.520]  But we have a way of identifying
[01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:06.520]  and differentiating these different cuts
[01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:09.120]  by the secondary identifier
[01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:12.120]  of who's the person associated with it.
[01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:16.000]  So everybody can agree, like Jay Sour is Jay Sour.
[01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:19.800]  This other Sour is this other Sour.
[01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:23.320]  And we can, even though there are two things
[01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:25.320]  that are going by the name Sour Diesel,
[01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:28.120]  we can differentiate them and understand
[01:30:28.120 --> 01:30:30.320]  just by ascribing a name to it.
[01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:34.000]  And typically they would like,
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.840]  they would wanna go to the original one,
[01:30:36.840 --> 01:30:38.800]  have the original one be the one,
[01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:41.480]  and all those other ones would be synonyms
[01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:44.640]  for the one and they'd all be the same cultivar,
[01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:48.480]  but you could differentiate through ascribing the name
[01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:50.960]  at the end and just appending that to it.
[01:30:50.960 --> 01:30:55.960]  So, yeah, I feel like even though it wasn't necessarily
[01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:02.800]  as well thought out and as elaborated
[01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:05.720]  as the international codes that have been going on
[01:31:05.720 --> 01:31:09.520]  for the last 150 years, same spirit and effort
[01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:13.480]  was like developed by a community
[01:31:13.480 --> 01:31:15.040]  and has been put into place.
[01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:16.600]  And it's something that keeps on going.
[01:31:16.600 --> 01:31:19.880]  And I feel like, medical was part of it,
[01:31:19.880 --> 01:31:21.560]  but I really feel like the internet
[01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:23.840]  and the sharing of information on the internet
[01:31:23.840 --> 01:31:25.520]  and documenting it and being like,
[01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:27.760]  oh shit, shit's gonna disappear.
[01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:29.320]  Cause that was part of it.
[01:31:29.320 --> 01:31:30.320]  Shit disappeared.
[01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:34.160]  And Baudelaire, when I talked to him about some of it,
[01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:37.000]  he was like, there was this forum that we were all on
[01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:41.200]  and one day it just, it was gone.
[01:31:41.200 --> 01:31:43.680]  And there was no longer that forum
[01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:47.000]  that had been a source of information for everybody.
[01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:51.800]  And so that's something that they understood,
[01:31:51.800 --> 01:31:53.880]  like the people who set up Overgrow
[01:31:53.880 --> 01:31:58.040]  and who really helped kind of develop the community
[01:31:58.040 --> 01:31:59.960]  and culture of online cannabis,
[01:31:59.960 --> 01:32:04.960]  which is very integral to the development
[01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:10.360]  of online culture in an interesting and unique way.
[01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:12.680]  The narratives dovetail.
[01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:17.680]  And yeah, I feel like those people who really made it
[01:32:17.880 --> 01:32:20.560]  sort of like a community science-based effort
[01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:23.160]  of documenting this stuff in real time,
[01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:28.040]  not just on the like, hey, I smoke weed and you smoke weed.
[01:32:28.040 --> 01:32:32.240]  Like, let's talk about weed, but like this has historical
[01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:35.720]  and like larger importance and ramifications
[01:32:35.720 --> 01:32:38.600]  beyond just small weed culture.
[01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:43.480]  But we're documenting in real time an important history.
[01:32:43.480 --> 01:32:47.480]  And that's cool that they were able to realize it,
[01:32:47.480 --> 01:32:50.000]  maybe not to the extent of what it is now.
[01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:53.000]  I mean, hindsight's always great, but you're right.
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.640]  So many advancements, so many of the people
[01:32:56.720 --> 01:32:59.880]  that I'll talk to that are really good
[01:32:59.880 --> 01:33:01.840]  with like organic growing.
[01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:04.360]  These different methodologies is,
[01:33:05.240 --> 01:33:08.560]  I know people that don't even smoke weed,
[01:33:08.560 --> 01:33:10.880]  but they're really into this.
[01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:13.920]  And that's where they met like-minded people.
[01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:16.720]  And it was, it was just dudes trying to figure it out
[01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:20.800]  because you couldn't go to your local ag extension
[01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:23.240]  or you couldn't talk to the grow store.
[01:33:23.240 --> 01:33:25.720]  You had to figure these things out.
[01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:30.040]  And God, a lot of these people are just so intelligent
[01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:33.960]  and motivated that the things
[01:33:33.960 --> 01:33:35.360]  that they were able to accomplish,
[01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:39.880]  but to have those forums to facilitate that was crucial
[01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:41.680]  because you couldn't openly go out and say,
[01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:45.160]  hey, anybody wanna talk about microbes
[01:33:45.160 --> 01:33:48.240]  and top feeding like my fucking tomato plants?
[01:33:48.240 --> 01:33:49.680]  You couldn't really do that.
[01:33:49.680 --> 01:33:52.080]  So those types of things are cool.
[01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:56.320]  And it's nice that they were documenting the seeds
[01:33:56.320 --> 01:33:58.860]  and the history of the strains in real time.
[01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:02.680]  I mean, you know, where we're kind of trying to do that
[01:34:02.680 --> 01:34:05.700]  with dope history is we've got a little bit to catch up
[01:34:05.700 --> 01:34:09.960]  to the current time, but yeah, these stories are important
[01:34:09.960 --> 01:34:11.200]  and the history is important
[01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:13.960]  because there's always gonna be arguments over them.
[01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:18.960]  Excuse me, after the fact, who's got what, where is it?
[01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:22.320]  But I do like naming them separately
[01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:24.380]  because that absolutely makes sense.
[01:34:24.380 --> 01:34:27.600]  Ultimately it came from one origin plant.
[01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:28.880]  They went their separate ways.
[01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:31.440]  They had their different expressions
[01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:33.880]  and that's kind of how you could say, you know,
[01:34:33.880 --> 01:34:37.640]  it's AJ's cut or it's JJ's cut, that type of thing.
[01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:41.320]  So you think we'll see more of that in the future
[01:34:41.320 --> 01:34:43.840]  with some of these other clone only strains?
[01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:48.840]  Cause I mean, we've got, well, gelato, what, 133, 41, 69.
[01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:53.040]  I'm just joking at this point, but.
[01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:55.640]  To a certain extent, they have to be worth copying.
[01:34:56.640 --> 01:34:59.600]  So there's only like,
[01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:02.880]  there's multiple chem beads floating around supposedly.
[01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:07.880]  There's the variegated, the non-variegated and a third one.
[01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:13.000]  And then there's the, I mean,
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:17.320]  the number of OGs is can't even be named or listed.
[01:35:17.320 --> 01:35:20.280]  There's so many different OGs
[01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:22.080]  that have popped up over the years.
[01:35:22.200 --> 01:35:26.200]  There were different chem 91s
[01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:30.080]  and there've been community efforts to verify
[01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:34.520]  and track down and, you know, say which one's which.
[01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:39.520]  I think that it's good when those things
[01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:43.200]  are just clear and easy and are able to be resolved.
[01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:48.080]  Like in the case of the JB's 91 cut,
[01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:50.840]  which was clearly not the 91,
[01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:52.560]  which Bodhi had bred with it.
[01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:56.400]  And he noted on his packs that it was the JB 91
[01:35:56.400 --> 01:36:00.960]  as opposed to the 91 versus the skunk VA 91.
[01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:06.880]  And so I think that those adding that
[01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:10.040]  just helps us differentiate between things.
[01:36:10.040 --> 01:36:14.240]  It doesn't necessarily like resolve the naming problem
[01:36:14.240 --> 01:36:17.520]  because a lot of the naming problem have what,
[01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:21.680]  the issue is not necessarily two different plants
[01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:25.600]  that are both good, but are clearly distinguishable.
[01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:30.000]  The issue is here's somebody trying to sell something
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:31.520]  as something that it's not.
[01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:34.160]  Right, right.
[01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:37.000]  Using a name for a different thing.
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:40.480]  And that's also not something
[01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:42.440]  you can necessarily solve for.
[01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:45.480]  Bad actors aren't the people who are going to be honest
[01:36:45.480 --> 01:36:49.240]  and aren't going to abide by community standards
[01:36:49.240 --> 01:36:50.280]  for naming shit.
[01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:55.280]  So there's not really any way to resolve that in our world.
[01:36:56.200 --> 01:36:58.000]  We can get mad at each other.
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:02.200]  We can pick her on the internet about which cuts real
[01:37:02.200 --> 01:37:06.400]  or you don't have it or whatever it may be.
[01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:08.400]  But at the end of the day,
[01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:12.800]  figuring out ways of resolving this stuff
[01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:17.800]  and coming to community sort of standards and norms
[01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:21.600]  and having agreements within the group of people
[01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:22.920]  who are good faith actors
[01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:25.360]  who are going to abide by that kind of shit
[01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:27.520]  is what a community does.
[01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:29.280]  And it's something that we've been,
[01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:32.240]  I wish-
[01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:34.160]  Decades of dialogue on it.
[01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:39.160]  Yeah, I wish almost like the database
[01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:40.840]  or the archive before,
[01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:43.960]  I wish we could almost get some of these people
[01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:47.320]  to grow out these plants, to document these plants,
[01:37:47.320 --> 01:37:51.240]  just meticulously kind of have leaves measured,
[01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:52.720]  have nodes space measured,
[01:37:52.720 --> 01:37:55.880]  things that you can kind of expect in a general sense
[01:37:55.880 --> 01:37:58.140]  because there will be variation.
[01:37:58.140 --> 01:37:58.980]  But you're right.
[01:37:58.980 --> 01:38:01.480]  Because again, I'm on the hunt for that chem 91.
[01:38:01.480 --> 01:38:05.360]  And because Gunk VA's name was attached to these seeds,
[01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:09.520]  I'm like, well, okay, that if I'm going for a chem,
[01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:11.000]  I trust that name.
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.820]  So that's who I went to.
[01:38:13.820 --> 01:38:15.720]  And it was a cross and it wasn't exactly
[01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:17.440]  what I was looking for, but again, it was a cross.
[01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:18.520]  It was great.
[01:38:18.520 --> 01:38:21.960]  But yeah, so I see where that fits in.
[01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:26.960]  But if there was some way for people to just check
[01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:28.840]  and verify themselves,
[01:38:28.840 --> 01:38:32.360]  have that card catalog of what to expect,
[01:38:32.360 --> 01:38:36.120]  because there is a lot of shenanigans out there
[01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:37.800]  to your point.
[01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:40.760]  All it takes is a piece of tape and a Sharpie.
[01:38:40.760 --> 01:38:43.960]  It'll be whatever name you want it to be.
[01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:48.960]  But like I've seen with at least seeds from some companies,
[01:38:49.040 --> 01:38:53.020]  mainly overseas companies, Spain, I'm looking at you,
[01:38:54.460 --> 01:38:58.480]  it's not what they say it is because I've grown
[01:38:58.480 --> 01:39:01.860]  what it should be and it's not even close.
[01:39:01.860 --> 01:39:05.660]  So if I never knew the difference though, how would I know?
[01:39:06.500 --> 01:39:08.440]  Oh, I need to plug my computer in.
[01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:12.420]  But yeah, I wish there was some kind of a visual archive.
[01:39:12.420 --> 01:39:17.420]  Has anybody wanted to take on such a huge challenge?
[01:39:19.620 --> 01:39:22.160]  How do you feel about side by sides, Trevor?
[01:39:23.900 --> 01:39:24.740]  They're great.
[01:39:24.740 --> 01:39:28.140]  I mean, I feel like Jay doing that with the headband
[01:39:28.140 --> 01:39:32.980]  and the not so headband and the sour,
[01:39:32.980 --> 01:39:34.660]  just because there was drama with it.
[01:39:35.140 --> 01:39:39.140]  I know that was something that there became some bickering
[01:39:39.140 --> 01:39:41.580]  and arguing over what was what.
[01:39:41.580 --> 01:39:43.500]  And it's cool to have a side by side,
[01:39:43.500 --> 01:39:46.420]  to have somebody like him do a side by side
[01:39:46.420 --> 01:39:49.540]  because you know you're getting a full expression
[01:39:49.540 --> 01:39:52.380]  of those plants in his environment.
[01:39:52.380 --> 01:39:55.580]  And so that was legit.
[01:39:55.580 --> 01:39:59.720]  I feel like anybody else doing it is equally as like,
[01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:05.400]  Jay has a platform to really like produce
[01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:07.400]  and to show and demonstrate.
[01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:11.360]  He killed it with that headband.
[01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:14.640]  Oh yeah, and his sour and what he did with the GMO
[01:40:14.640 --> 01:40:16.640]  and all the way back to the sour monkey
[01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:19.240]  when he was running Gold Coast Genetics.
[01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:21.080]  He turned me on.
[01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:22.560]  He was the first person I saw
[01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:26.240]  who had grown Golden Coast Genetics and stuff.
[01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:31.240]  And then Mr. Bob was the first person who had like flowers.
[01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:34.040]  I hadn't seen any pictures of it,
[01:40:34.040 --> 01:40:36.160]  but he had some flowers of it.
[01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:40.520]  And Jay's grow the sour monkey
[01:40:40.520 --> 01:40:42.440]  and different things like that was legit.
[01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:46.440]  So yeah, I think that that's helpful.
[01:40:52.120 --> 01:40:56.960]  It's important to the extent that these are,
[01:40:56.960 --> 01:41:00.520]  the different plants that are keepers,
[01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:01.960]  they're keepers for a reason.
[01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:05.560]  They've been kept around for as long as they have
[01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:08.280]  and are as contentious as they are,
[01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:11.980]  or knocked off as often as they are
[01:41:11.980 --> 01:41:14.840]  because one, they're valuable
[01:41:14.840 --> 01:41:18.060]  on a flower sort of commerce side,
[01:41:18.060 --> 01:41:20.240]  but also too as a breeding stock.
[01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:24.240]  And that's another issue that becomes very contentious
[01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:25.800]  with some of these genetics.
[01:41:25.800 --> 01:41:30.800]  And I think that while I understand that
[01:41:31.800 --> 01:41:36.680]  and it's definitely a component
[01:41:36.680 --> 01:41:40.960]  of keeping these plants around
[01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:44.600]  has been putting them in the hands of trusted people
[01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:49.560]  and not necessarily just letting them out.
[01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:52.660]  That's been something that like people have been,
[01:41:53.180 --> 01:41:56.260]  you know, they've done for a long time.
[01:41:56.260 --> 01:42:01.260]  I think that we kind of need to get past it
[01:42:01.940 --> 01:42:04.660]  because a lot of these plants are,
[01:42:06.620 --> 01:42:10.500]  they're very old and they're living
[01:42:10.500 --> 01:42:13.220]  in a kind of precarious situation
[01:42:13.220 --> 01:42:16.020]  and we need to preserve them in some way
[01:42:16.020 --> 01:42:19.700]  that actually makes it so they're available to,
[01:42:20.700 --> 01:42:23.740]  in a way like you're talking about
[01:42:23.740 --> 01:42:26.860]  where how does a person go and know
[01:42:26.860 --> 01:42:29.940]  that they're getting skunk VA's Chem 91?
[01:42:29.940 --> 01:42:31.740]  How does somebody know that they're going
[01:42:31.740 --> 01:42:33.540]  and they're getting a Chem D
[01:42:33.540 --> 01:42:36.300]  or the different variant of the Chem D
[01:42:36.300 --> 01:42:39.840]  that they know as the Chem D and like as the Chem D,
[01:42:39.840 --> 01:42:43.380]  the dirty D or the non-variegated D, you know?
[01:42:43.380 --> 01:42:47.160]  Like if you know the variegated D and think of that as D,
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.120]  being able to get that one is the one
[01:42:50.120 --> 01:42:51.680]  that you're gonna want.
[01:42:51.680 --> 01:42:53.800]  Whereas if you know the non-variegated D
[01:42:53.800 --> 01:42:57.080]  and that's the one that you want, then obviously.
[01:42:57.080 --> 01:42:59.520]  And making these available,
[01:42:59.520 --> 01:43:03.000]  I know it's probably not going to happen
[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.440]  because of the way that the legal system is set up,
[01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:09.920]  but there needs to be some form of backing up
[01:43:09.920 --> 01:43:14.200]  and preserving these genetics as like a public good.
[01:43:14.200 --> 01:43:18.200]  Yeah, is it like in a tissue culture kind of way or?
[01:43:18.200 --> 01:43:19.040]  Yeah.
[01:43:19.040 --> 01:43:19.880]  Okay.
[01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:23.640]  Yeah, tissue culture and also just in a,
[01:43:24.760 --> 01:43:29.400]  like this is a germplasm.
[01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:30.920]  It's important germplasm.
[01:43:30.920 --> 01:43:33.720]  It's the germplasm that's been selected
[01:43:33.720 --> 01:43:37.880]  and sifted over the last 30 or 40 years
[01:43:37.880 --> 01:43:39.840]  of people hunting through plants.
[01:43:40.840 --> 01:43:44.520]  And every time one's lost,
[01:43:44.520 --> 01:43:49.520]  it's a massive loss to not just the individual
[01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:54.680]  who is holding it, but to everybody else who that's,
[01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.200]  you're losing part of the gene pool.
[01:43:57.200 --> 01:44:01.000]  And we need to particularly like selected elements
[01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:02.880]  of the gene pool that have been selected
[01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:04.800]  for particular reasons.
[01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:08.200]  And preserving those and making them available
[01:44:08.240 --> 01:44:10.840]  and making them so that they're authentic
[01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:15.200]  and authenticated rather is important.
[01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:20.200]  It's something that there are public backups
[01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:23.940]  for all kinds of different germplasms,
[01:44:24.960 --> 01:44:28.120]  all different things that are out there that are important,
[01:44:28.120 --> 01:44:32.680]  be it from fruit trees to, you know,
[01:44:34.120 --> 01:44:36.280]  corn varieties, et cetera.
[01:44:36.280 --> 01:44:39.680]  But cannabis is one of, and particularly drug cannabis
[01:44:39.680 --> 01:44:43.360]  is underrepresented in any form of public backup
[01:44:43.360 --> 01:44:45.200]  and repository.
[01:44:45.200 --> 01:44:48.360]  And that's something that kind of has been left
[01:44:48.360 --> 01:44:50.920]  to this community effort that's kind of wild.
[01:44:53.080 --> 01:44:54.800]  There's a Millennium Seed Bank
[01:44:54.800 --> 01:44:58.320]  and it's preserving almost everything
[01:44:58.320 --> 01:44:59.920]  and almost no cannabis.
[01:44:59.920 --> 01:45:02.160]  And the only people preserving cannabis
[01:45:02.160 --> 01:45:03.920]  are people who have been breaking the law
[01:45:03.920 --> 01:45:06.960]  for the last 40 years.
[01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:10.960]  Cause I don't, you know, I don't think for the majority
[01:45:10.960 --> 01:45:15.960]  of the people, anything almost pre nineties or pre 2000
[01:45:17.240 --> 01:45:22.240]  is that attractive to them as far as like an end flower
[01:45:22.280 --> 01:45:26.280]  or an end product as a breeding material,
[01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:29.480]  as like breeding stock, probably more so.
[01:45:29.480 --> 01:45:32.240]  I mean, I like this stuff from back then,
[01:45:32.240 --> 01:45:34.360]  so I don't put myself in that category,
[01:45:34.360 --> 01:45:38.400]  but you know, the clone only is today,
[01:45:38.400 --> 01:45:41.480]  I think probably have a shorter shelf life
[01:45:41.480 --> 01:45:45.320]  because they're more market driven than utility driven.
[01:45:47.720 --> 01:45:48.640]  Yeah.
[01:45:50.480 --> 01:45:54.840]  I mean, I definitely feel like obviously the market
[01:45:54.840 --> 01:45:56.520]  has determined a lot of things.
[01:45:56.520 --> 01:45:59.080]  THC percentage being a large element
[01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:04.120]  of what the market values has driven THC percentages up
[01:46:04.160 --> 01:46:09.160]  and indoor in California being the primary driver.
[01:46:11.640 --> 01:46:15.000]  I know I just dropped off a lot of the Malawi chem
[01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:18.040]  and Malawi Wilson to people in LA.
[01:46:18.040 --> 01:46:21.640]  It's funny cause they're like, you know, they smoke indoor,
[01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:22.960]  they smoke good indoor.
[01:46:23.480 --> 01:46:28.480]  And I got all these cats really fucking awkwardly high.
[01:46:30.760 --> 01:46:34.280]  I bet dude, that outdoor Malawi chem.
[01:46:34.280 --> 01:46:39.280]  And it hits, it's one of those things where it's like,
[01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:44.640]  it just gets you really, really racy
[01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:48.040]  and is kind of uncomfortable to be honest.
[01:46:49.160 --> 01:46:52.840]  And I was with a dude, I mean, shout out buddy,
[01:46:53.720 --> 01:46:54.560]  kill a lot.
[01:46:54.560 --> 01:46:55.760]  Yeah, he's in chat.
[01:46:56.760 --> 01:46:59.400]  Yeah, shout out buddy, smoking a blunt here.
[01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:04.600]  We smoked, I'm smoking literally the same kind of blunt
[01:47:04.600 --> 01:47:06.760]  we rolled up smoking.
[01:47:06.760 --> 01:47:11.760]  And he was like, he definitely got zooted.
[01:47:13.480 --> 01:47:17.680]  Oh wow, he's a seasoned person.
[01:47:17.680 --> 01:47:19.200]  Exactly.
[01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:21.160]  Wow.
[01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:24.240]  Yeah, Mace mentioned that he smoked a fatty
[01:47:24.240 --> 01:47:26.360]  when he got home and was up till 2 a.m.
[01:47:26.360 --> 01:47:29.120]  The shit just, it hits different.
[01:47:29.120 --> 01:47:32.400]  And I didn't think it was,
[01:47:32.400 --> 01:47:35.120]  I didn't necessarily think it was gonna,
[01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:36.520]  it doesn't look the best,
[01:47:36.520 --> 01:47:38.600]  it doesn't necessarily taste the best,
[01:47:38.600 --> 01:47:43.600]  but it's not like, it's a really greasy resin.
[01:47:44.880 --> 01:47:48.400]  Okay, so it's not like a concentrator then?
[01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:49.680]  Oh no, not at all.
[01:47:50.680 --> 01:47:53.920]  But it hits really, really, really hard.
[01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:58.920]  And when people talk about long season equatorials,
[01:47:59.680 --> 01:48:00.800]  this hits like that.
[01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:05.800]  This gets you in a place that none of the new hybrid shit
[01:48:05.840 --> 01:48:07.000]  will get you.
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:10.320]  And even if you're into that stuff,
[01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:14.240]  you're into hype flavors and you have access to it,
[01:48:14.240 --> 01:48:16.480]  when you try this, you'll recognize the difference.
[01:48:16.480 --> 01:48:19.600]  And even if it doesn't touch the palate the same way,
[01:48:20.360 --> 01:48:22.000]  my homie smoked some of this
[01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:25.760]  and then smoked some of the strawberry grease monkey
[01:48:25.760 --> 01:48:30.760]  from Masonic, and the strawberry just coats your palate,
[01:48:30.960 --> 01:48:35.960]  super sweet, really, really just overpowering terps.
[01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:40.960]  Not much terps on this, not nearly as overpowering,
[01:48:40.960 --> 01:48:43.080]  but thick, greasy smoke.
[01:48:43.080 --> 01:48:48.080]  And he's like, fuck, this one doesn't taste,
[01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:50.440]  but it fucking cuts through and hits.
[01:48:52.160 --> 01:48:53.960]  Do you think that would be something
[01:48:53.960 --> 01:48:56.040]  that people would want to,
[01:48:56.040 --> 01:48:59.920]  cause again, it doesn't pass the bag appeal
[01:48:59.920 --> 01:49:01.480]  or the nose appeal,
[01:49:01.480 --> 01:49:06.240]  but once you get past that to an educated person,
[01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:07.880]  they're gonna appreciate it for what it is.
[01:49:07.880 --> 01:49:11.320]  So is that something that later that may be concentrated
[01:49:11.320 --> 01:49:13.360]  and then you can add terps into it?
[01:49:13.360 --> 01:49:15.640]  Or is that, do you think that would actually throw
[01:49:15.640 --> 01:49:17.240]  the overall effect?
[01:49:17.280 --> 01:49:19.400]  Is it gonna skew the adventure?
[01:49:19.400 --> 01:49:20.800]  Yeah, no, I think it does.
[01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:25.800]  Like it's, I don't know, it's not for everyone,
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.900]  but it definitely, if you know, you know,
[01:49:28.900 --> 01:49:30.920]  and it hits differently
[01:49:30.920 --> 01:49:33.120]  and it may not have the same bag appeal,
[01:49:33.120 --> 01:49:35.200]  but it's got a good nose.
[01:49:35.200 --> 01:49:40.200]  It just, it's not like, the smoke is, it's intense.
[01:49:41.960 --> 01:49:46.420]  Like I dig it, but it's also,
[01:49:47.760 --> 01:49:50.960]  it's when it's all you're smoking, it's kind of rough.
[01:49:50.960 --> 01:49:54.760]  There's a, I'm like dogs had mentioned,
[01:49:54.760 --> 01:49:56.520]  I like those kinds of sedative,
[01:49:56.520 --> 01:49:59.440]  heavy narcotic highs a bit more.
[01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:04.360]  And all I've got is this flower around, but it's been fun.
[01:50:04.360 --> 01:50:07.880]  It's really been wild to notice those differences
[01:50:07.880 --> 01:50:09.400]  on such an intense level.
[01:50:09.400 --> 01:50:12.300]  Cause the Malawi, it hits different.
[01:50:14.120 --> 01:50:15.760]  Yeah, I've not tried it.
[01:50:15.800 --> 01:50:18.520]  I would love to one day try that
[01:50:18.520 --> 01:50:21.400]  because it sounds like it, man.
[01:50:21.400 --> 01:50:23.360]  And then some of that stuff that you grow,
[01:50:23.360 --> 01:50:25.320]  it just looks, it looks so good.
[01:50:25.320 --> 01:50:27.200]  It looks dangerous.
[01:50:27.200 --> 01:50:29.480]  That's what I'm trying to say, basically.
[01:50:29.480 --> 01:50:30.920]  I'm like, you look dangerous.
[01:50:30.920 --> 01:50:31.980]  How are you doing?
[01:50:33.720 --> 01:50:34.840]  Oh man.
[01:50:34.840 --> 01:50:38.280]  Well, I'm gonna pull out another pack here that I got.
[01:50:38.280 --> 01:50:41.000]  It kind of ties into it here.
[01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:42.520]  And we could pull some out if you want.
[01:50:42.520 --> 01:50:45.160]  I know we're getting close to the two hour point here,
[01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:46.560]  but we're just hanging out.
[01:50:46.560 --> 01:50:48.920]  So let's see, it kind of ties into it.
[01:50:48.920 --> 01:50:50.760]  A sour stomper.
[01:50:50.760 --> 01:50:51.600]  Oh, come on.
[01:50:51.600 --> 01:50:53.080]  I can never focus, right?
[01:50:53.080 --> 01:50:55.240]  Sour stomper times Thor hammer.
[01:50:55.240 --> 01:50:58.560]  These are regular auto flower seeds.
[01:50:58.560 --> 01:51:01.080]  These are from a chef Alex.
[01:51:01.080 --> 01:51:05.240]  And I've not really run too many autos before.
[01:51:05.240 --> 01:51:07.360]  And he said, you got to give these a try.
[01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:09.400]  They're regulars, which is pretty interesting
[01:51:09.400 --> 01:51:12.480]  because typically you're not seeing regulars from autos.
[01:51:12.760 --> 01:51:15.440]  You're getting a femmes.
[01:51:15.440 --> 01:51:17.360]  So that'll be interesting.
[01:51:17.360 --> 01:51:22.120]  But I do also, I had probably said last show,
[01:51:22.120 --> 01:51:23.480]  there are two people that were like,
[01:51:23.480 --> 01:51:25.880]  dude, I have these autos that you want to try.
[01:51:25.880 --> 01:51:30.400]  So I'm like, okay, I'll set up an auto tent to try it
[01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:32.480]  just to see what's out there.
[01:51:33.640 --> 01:51:38.640]  But I do want to say that these little vials and stuff
[01:51:38.720 --> 01:51:42.720]  that we ship in, even though it's gonna make you
[01:51:42.720 --> 01:51:45.560]  have to buy more than a postage stamp,
[01:51:45.560 --> 01:51:46.720]  they're so critical.
[01:51:46.720 --> 01:51:50.680]  Because if you go through the seed sorter machine
[01:51:50.680 --> 01:51:55.000]  or the sorting machines at the post office,
[01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:59.360]  those things are like so heavy and so precise
[01:51:59.360 --> 01:52:01.400]  as far as what they're doing.
[01:52:01.400 --> 01:52:04.240]  If they're not in a little vial,
[01:52:04.240 --> 01:52:09.240]  you're gonna get seeds that come to you looking like this.
[01:52:12.800 --> 01:52:15.160]  They're flat, they're smashed.
[01:52:15.160 --> 01:52:18.620]  So thank you for trying to send some.
[01:52:18.620 --> 01:52:20.680]  But for everybody, I've done this too.
[01:52:20.680 --> 01:52:23.140]  You think you're just gonna send it like a birthday card
[01:52:23.140 --> 01:52:28.080]  and just like get a little stamp to pay for it
[01:52:28.080 --> 01:52:30.800]  instead of paying like the four or five bucks,
[01:52:30.800 --> 01:52:35.120]  which sucks when you send out like 10, 15 at a time,
[01:52:37.160 --> 01:52:38.480]  your beans are gonna get crushed.
[01:52:38.480 --> 01:52:41.660]  So don't break your heart, get those little vials
[01:52:41.660 --> 01:52:44.080]  or get something that's a little sturdier
[01:52:44.080 --> 01:52:45.240]  because it's not gonna go through
[01:52:45.240 --> 01:52:46.960]  that thin little sorting machine.
[01:52:48.400 --> 01:52:51.320]  But yeah, so Sour Stomper, these are some autos
[01:52:51.320 --> 01:52:54.680]  that I'm gonna get trying soon as well.
[01:52:55.720 --> 01:52:58.440]  And then I've, oh, I've got just a couple more.
[01:52:58.440 --> 01:53:00.780]  I'm trying to switch the camera and unmute myself.
[01:53:01.620 --> 01:53:02.860]  I've got a couple more that I'll pull out here.
[01:53:02.860 --> 01:53:05.740]  But Trevor, did you say you had some stuff there
[01:53:05.740 --> 01:53:08.500]  that you wanted to, or you were excited for?
[01:53:08.500 --> 01:53:10.540]  I know I saw your post the other day, man.
[01:53:10.540 --> 01:53:13.180]  You definitely have a few beans sitting around.
[01:53:13.180 --> 01:53:17.260]  Yeah, yeah, no, I hope to pop all that this year.
[01:53:18.380 --> 01:53:19.580]  Nice.
[01:53:19.580 --> 01:53:21.820]  But I've got these.
[01:53:21.820 --> 01:53:26.820]  This is Afro Pips Malawi Gold.
[01:53:27.940 --> 01:53:30.120]  This comes from The Real Seed Company.
[01:53:31.220 --> 01:53:36.220]  Afro Pips had, they were a company back in the day
[01:53:36.700 --> 01:53:39.700]  in the like 2000s, and they provided
[01:53:39.700 --> 01:53:42.500]  a lot of different African varieties.
[01:53:42.500 --> 01:53:46.140]  Their Malawi was really well regarded.
[01:53:46.940 --> 01:53:50.060]  I've heard a number of people say that their,
[01:53:50.060 --> 01:53:53.340]  the Afro Pips Malawi stock is better
[01:53:53.340 --> 01:53:56.940]  than the African Seed Company's Malawi stock,
[01:53:56.940 --> 01:53:59.880]  which is the Malawi stock that Bodhi used.
[01:54:01.180 --> 01:54:04.580]  I grew out the Malawi stock from Bodhi.
[01:54:06.260 --> 01:54:07.700]  It was legit.
[01:54:07.700 --> 01:54:10.000]  I made the Malawi chems with that,
[01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:15.000]  and also made more of the Malawi Gold seed stock.
[01:54:17.180 --> 01:54:20.740]  So I hope to do both of these
[01:54:20.740 --> 01:54:23.200]  and increase both of these this year.
[01:54:25.020 --> 01:54:26.700]  Then I got these.
[01:54:27.540 --> 01:54:30.580]  I got these from Kevin Jodry.
[01:54:30.580 --> 01:54:32.220]  Shout out Kevin Jodry.
[01:54:32.220 --> 01:54:33.460]  Nice.
[01:54:33.460 --> 01:54:38.140]  So that says, there we go, Gold Star F5.
[01:54:38.140 --> 01:54:43.140]  It's the Sensi Star Malawi Gold that was made by Bodhi.
[01:54:44.140 --> 01:54:47.460]  So it's an old Sensi Star across
[01:54:47.460 --> 01:54:50.860]  to the Malawi Gold taken to F5.
[01:54:50.860 --> 01:54:55.700]  And yeah, super stoked on that Malawi.
[01:54:55.700 --> 01:54:57.660]  Yeah, that seems like it would be
[01:54:57.660 --> 01:54:59.460]  kind of the best of both worlds.
[01:54:59.460 --> 01:55:02.940]  Like again, not having had the Malawi,
[01:55:02.940 --> 01:55:05.300]  I need to drink more, cotton mouth's kicking in.
[01:55:06.540 --> 01:55:11.100]  But that seems to be, again, a bit racier, longer lasting.
[01:55:11.100 --> 01:55:15.060]  Whereas Sensi Star, what I think of when I remember that,
[01:55:15.060 --> 01:55:17.260]  that was more of that heavy indica.
[01:55:17.260 --> 01:55:20.420]  So does it meet in the middle
[01:55:20.420 --> 01:55:25.180]  or do you still get a little bit of leaners with the F5s?
[01:55:25.180 --> 01:55:28.620]  The way it was described to me and what I've seen of it,
[01:55:28.620 --> 01:55:32.740]  you get more of a spear sort of structure.
[01:55:32.740 --> 01:55:37.580]  So it was a bushy, like many tops,
[01:55:37.580 --> 01:55:41.220]  lots of spears, very thin, narrow sort of spears,
[01:55:41.220 --> 01:55:44.100]  not like big round indica sort of nugs.
[01:55:46.360 --> 01:55:49.060]  Heavy tropinaline, supposedly,
[01:55:49.060 --> 01:55:52.760]  like crazy, crazy, crazy loud tropinaline.
[01:55:53.360 --> 01:55:58.360]  And, but a shorter squatter plant that was quicker.
[01:55:59.400 --> 01:56:03.720]  It wasn't the, it sounded like the Sensi
[01:56:03.720 --> 01:56:06.400]  brought the flowering time down,
[01:56:06.400 --> 01:56:08.960]  kept it a little bit more maintained,
[01:56:08.960 --> 01:56:13.400]  but the Malawi still had more of a spear-like structure
[01:56:13.400 --> 01:56:17.160]  and it threw some of those heavy,
[01:56:17.160 --> 01:56:19.320]  heavy tropinaline chirps on it.
[01:56:19.360 --> 01:56:23.640]  And I think it was a round table also mentioned it.
[01:56:23.640 --> 01:56:27.320]  And so I've heard from both Kevin Jodry and Roundtable
[01:56:27.320 --> 01:56:31.360]  that that stuff is really, really heavy tropinaline.
[01:56:32.560 --> 01:56:33.580]  And that's nice.
[01:56:33.580 --> 01:56:36.680]  Again, that's a person who has had access
[01:56:36.680 --> 01:56:38.720]  and exposure to a lot of different plants.
[01:56:38.720 --> 01:56:41.100]  So when, you know, I tend to think
[01:56:41.100 --> 01:56:45.160]  if they're excited about something, I would be as well.
[01:56:45.160 --> 01:56:46.120]  So.
[01:56:46.120 --> 01:56:46.940]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:56:46.940 --> 01:56:49.080]  And I hope to increase all of these
[01:56:49.840 --> 01:56:54.200]  and make a number of Malawi hybrids and a gold star hybrids
[01:56:54.200 --> 01:56:57.800]  and get those back up to Jodry because he was cool.
[01:56:57.800 --> 01:56:59.760]  Kevin, Kevin's legit.
[01:56:59.760 --> 01:57:03.920]  Like no matter whoever I troll, whatever,
[01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:07.360]  like any shit I say, like people think I have beef
[01:57:07.360 --> 01:57:09.640]  with Kevin and not at all.
[01:57:09.640 --> 01:57:10.640]  Dude's legit.
[01:57:10.640 --> 01:57:15.000]  He, he's always been super generous and reaches out
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:16.800]  and is a kind guy and doesn't,
[01:57:19.120 --> 01:57:22.800]  yeah, he's just somebody who's as real as can be
[01:57:22.800 --> 01:57:23.700]  and doesn't.
[01:57:24.840 --> 01:57:25.840]  He's helped a lot.
[01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:28.400]  He's helped a lot of people, which, you know,
[01:57:28.400 --> 01:57:29.480]  is always admirable.
[01:57:29.480 --> 01:57:31.880]  So that's good.
[01:57:31.880 --> 01:57:33.520]  Yeah, it doesn't, he's like, whatever,
[01:57:33.520 --> 01:57:36.280]  you have your opinion, I have mine, like fuck off.
[01:57:36.280 --> 01:57:39.440]  Like, I'm not really like, it's no sweat off his back
[01:57:39.440 --> 01:57:42.080]  that like we have different opinions about things.
[01:57:42.080 --> 01:57:45.400]  And so I appreciate him for just being real like that,
[01:57:45.400 --> 01:57:48.640]  where he's like, whatever, like that's what you think.
[01:57:49.160 --> 01:57:50.000]  This is what I think.
[01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.480]  And Kevin will always keep it real like that.
[01:57:52.480 --> 01:57:54.720]  Yeah, I can appreciate that.
[01:57:54.720 --> 01:57:57.680]  I blame it or I accredit the East Coastness.
[01:57:57.680 --> 01:58:00.600]  I tell you what, I loved it when I went out to that area,
[01:58:00.600 --> 01:58:02.840]  man, I'm like, these are my people.
[01:58:02.840 --> 01:58:04.320]  Like, we're just keeping it real here.
[01:58:04.320 --> 01:58:06.200]  Hey, fuck you too, man.
[01:58:06.200 --> 01:58:07.360]  All right, cool, later.
[01:58:08.760 --> 01:58:11.540]  Yeah, oh shit.
[01:58:11.540 --> 01:58:15.480]  Well, I also, I'm not gonna pop these this year,
[01:58:15.480 --> 01:58:20.480]  but the Ricketson Cicada Puck Hash Plant Backcross 2,
[01:58:21.600 --> 01:58:23.200]  that's good breeding stock.
[01:58:24.040 --> 01:58:26.840]  Everything they've dropped and made with that puck line
[01:58:26.840 --> 01:58:28.200]  has been phenomenal.
[01:58:28.200 --> 01:58:32.360]  So yeah, can't say enough about that.
[01:58:32.360 --> 01:58:34.320]  And yeah.
[01:58:34.320 --> 01:58:36.000]  I've heard good things about that.
[01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:39.240]  And you had dog days, you had one earlier too.
[01:58:39.240 --> 01:58:41.440]  I was probably talking to the dog right now.
[01:58:42.360 --> 01:58:43.800]  Sorry, I was telling dogs to go lay down,
[01:58:43.800 --> 01:58:44.920]  they're real excited.
[01:58:45.360 --> 01:58:46.720]  No, it's all good, man.
[01:58:46.720 --> 01:58:48.880]  I was just saying, Ricketson Cicada,
[01:58:48.880 --> 01:58:50.640]  I saw you flashed a pack there earlier.
[01:58:50.640 --> 01:58:53.160]  I wasn't sure which one you had.
[01:58:53.160 --> 01:58:54.520]  I'm running two right now.
[01:58:54.520 --> 01:58:57.400]  I just got my hands on this Disco,
[01:58:57.400 --> 01:58:59.400]  someone that I, I think I met him actually
[01:58:59.400 --> 01:59:01.960]  in JJ's Discord, the Top Dog Discord.
[01:59:01.960 --> 01:59:04.960]  But I picked this up sealed.
[01:59:04.960 --> 01:59:08.600]  It's the headband crossed with the Pacific Northwest
[01:59:08.600 --> 01:59:10.840]  Hash Plant N01 male.
[01:59:10.840 --> 01:59:13.160]  And then I got the headband mom.
[01:59:13.160 --> 01:59:17.640]  And then I'm also running a dead band.
[01:59:17.640 --> 01:59:18.760]  I got one female.
[01:59:18.760 --> 01:59:21.480]  I only had a couple of seeds pop out of the F2s,
[01:59:21.480 --> 01:59:23.920]  but I had some dead band F2s.
[01:59:23.920 --> 01:59:25.720]  Duke made the original dead band.
[01:59:25.720 --> 01:59:30.640]  It was the same headband hit with the basic skunk male.
[01:59:30.640 --> 01:59:33.960]  And then someone else that I'd met on Discord
[01:59:33.960 --> 01:59:35.920]  sent me F2s that they made of that.
[01:59:35.920 --> 01:59:37.200]  So I got a female of that.
[01:59:37.200 --> 01:59:42.200]  And then the Sensi Star to the Puck Hash Plant back cross one.
[01:59:43.920 --> 01:59:46.920]  I think I got four females and one male.
[01:59:46.920 --> 01:59:48.000]  I didn't have a whole pack.
[01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.560]  I had someone sent me half a pack of these
[01:59:50.560 --> 01:59:51.960]  and she gave them to me.
[01:59:51.960 --> 01:59:55.520]  She's a really cool person that I met on Instagram.
[01:59:55.520 --> 01:59:57.520]  And so I'm running those out.
[01:59:57.520 --> 01:59:59.240]  I'm gonna clone everything.
[02:00:00.120 --> 02:00:02.080]  I messaged Mr. Bob about him.
[02:00:02.080 --> 02:00:05.640]  And I told him that I was running those Sensi Star Pucks.
[02:00:05.640 --> 02:00:08.440]  And he's like, dude, clone every single one of them.
[02:00:08.440 --> 02:00:09.360]  And I asked if I could,
[02:00:09.360 --> 02:00:11.000]  and I didn't even have time to ask.
[02:00:11.040 --> 02:00:13.760]  He said, clone them and make more seeds, please.
[02:00:13.760 --> 02:00:17.080]  So I'm gonna make sure I do that.
[02:00:17.080 --> 02:00:21.600]  And then the DNL back cross F2s.
[02:00:22.720 --> 02:00:26.040]  Super grateful to JJ that he gave me these.
[02:00:26.040 --> 02:00:28.440]  I offered to buy them several times.
[02:00:28.440 --> 02:00:30.760]  And then he was like, just give me your address.
[02:00:30.760 --> 02:00:31.600]  And he gave them to me.
[02:00:31.600 --> 02:00:33.920]  And it was like right after Christmas too.
[02:00:33.920 --> 02:00:35.080]  I was so stoked, dude.
[02:00:35.080 --> 02:00:37.760]  So like, thank you, JJ.
[02:00:37.760 --> 02:00:39.960]  I'm a huge Sour fan.
[02:00:39.960 --> 02:00:44.680]  The Chem D TK Sour order is like, that's for potency.
[02:00:44.680 --> 02:00:47.720]  But really like my heart, my heart lies with Sour Diesel.
[02:00:47.720 --> 02:00:49.680]  Like I love Sour Diesel.
[02:00:49.680 --> 02:00:52.200]  And this, you know, the whole lineage thing,
[02:00:52.200 --> 02:00:53.640]  like I'm not gonna make any claims
[02:00:53.640 --> 02:00:54.840]  because there's a lot of like,
[02:00:54.840 --> 02:00:58.000]  it's a heated debate, very debated topic, you know.
[02:00:58.000 --> 02:00:59.440]  So DNL.
[02:00:59.440 --> 02:01:02.800]  Possibly and probably in Sour Diesel, the DNL.
[02:01:02.800 --> 02:01:05.280]  And this being a back cross and an F2,
[02:01:05.280 --> 02:01:06.680]  I feel like I got a good chance
[02:01:06.680 --> 02:01:09.640]  of seeing something from the DNL side.
[02:01:10.320 --> 02:01:11.160]  They are old seeds though.
[02:01:11.160 --> 02:01:12.480]  So I've only got three to sprout.
[02:01:12.480 --> 02:01:14.680]  I think it's been seven or eight days.
[02:01:14.680 --> 02:01:17.160]  So I'm giving them, I put them into a dome.
[02:01:18.040 --> 02:01:18.960]  I got three though.
[02:01:18.960 --> 02:01:20.680]  I mean, that's plenty.
[02:01:20.680 --> 02:01:22.680]  I'll be happy with three of them running,
[02:01:22.680 --> 02:01:25.240]  but I'm really excited to run those.
[02:01:25.240 --> 02:01:27.720]  And then I'm about to pop some,
[02:01:28.640 --> 02:01:31.640]  another friend that I met through Duke's Discord.
[02:01:31.640 --> 02:01:35.000]  He gave me, I won these actually in a giveaway.
[02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.480]  Yeah, Titan is super cool.
[02:01:37.480 --> 02:01:38.880]  Thank you, Titan.
[02:01:38.920 --> 02:01:40.840]  I won these in a giveaway they did,
[02:01:40.840 --> 02:01:44.080]  but it was like, dude, it was like fake.
[02:01:44.080 --> 02:01:46.880]  Yeah, it's his Adam Splitter, but they're the F1s.
[02:01:47.920 --> 02:01:50.520]  I was super happy that I got these.
[02:01:50.520 --> 02:01:52.200]  I don't usually win stuff,
[02:01:52.200 --> 02:01:54.280]  but I had a lot of luck for a couple of weeks.
[02:01:54.280 --> 02:01:56.600]  And I won some seeds from Duke,
[02:01:56.600 --> 02:01:57.440]  and then I turned around
[02:01:57.440 --> 02:02:00.280]  and I won some seeds from Titan as well.
[02:02:00.280 --> 02:02:02.440]  But I'm popping these because I love Sour Diesel.
[02:02:02.440 --> 02:02:05.520]  This is his take on the Sour line he's made.
[02:02:05.520 --> 02:02:07.400]  And I've seen the plants grown from it.
[02:02:07.440 --> 02:02:09.760]  And they're just very, very impressive.
[02:02:13.120 --> 02:02:14.240]  I got one more, sorry.
[02:02:14.240 --> 02:02:15.680]  I need to get three Hunza's.
[02:02:15.680 --> 02:02:19.480]  Someone that I met through the FCP community,
[02:02:19.480 --> 02:02:21.760]  Jared, a good friend of mine.
[02:02:21.760 --> 02:02:25.520]  He sent me some of the Hunza Valley 91 reproductions he did.
[02:02:25.520 --> 02:02:27.640]  He F2ed and then F3'd them.
[02:02:27.640 --> 02:02:29.960]  I think he even made F4s this year,
[02:02:29.960 --> 02:02:32.520]  but he sent me some F2s and some F3s.
[02:02:32.520 --> 02:02:33.840]  I got a bunch of those,
[02:02:33.840 --> 02:02:36.960]  but I'm doing some of them outdoors this spring.
[02:02:37.520 --> 02:02:38.560]  I'm gonna do these in a greenhouse.
[02:02:38.560 --> 02:02:42.200]  He bred them outdoors and I'm really excited to do those.
[02:02:42.200 --> 02:02:43.240]  That's cool, man.
[02:02:43.240 --> 02:02:45.360]  That is one thing I do love about the community, man.
[02:02:45.360 --> 02:02:47.640]  There's a lot of sharing going on.
[02:02:47.640 --> 02:02:48.640]  Absolutely.
[02:02:48.640 --> 02:02:51.240]  Yeah, it's fun to get things out.
[02:02:51.240 --> 02:02:53.600]  And it's cool to see people growing your stuff too.
[02:02:53.600 --> 02:02:56.080]  Like that's kind of the, that's a hoot,
[02:02:56.080 --> 02:02:58.080]  as you know, old people would say.
[02:02:58.080 --> 02:03:00.160]  I can't praise the community enough, man.
[02:03:00.160 --> 02:03:01.120]  Cause like I'm young
[02:03:01.120 --> 02:03:03.840]  and I probably could have got involved
[02:03:03.840 --> 02:03:04.760]  in the community before,
[02:03:04.760 --> 02:03:06.560]  but I did not really know the extent
[02:03:07.080 --> 02:03:08.640]  of how deep the forums went
[02:03:08.640 --> 02:03:10.040]  and really what they were.
[02:03:10.040 --> 02:03:12.040]  I kind of mentioned that earlier.
[02:03:12.040 --> 02:03:15.240]  Once it was this channel that kind of brought me,
[02:03:15.240 --> 02:03:16.800]  first I was watching the YouTube
[02:03:16.800 --> 02:03:19.720]  and then kind of through watching your guys' shows
[02:03:19.720 --> 02:03:23.000]  and like the Breeder Roundtable series was my favorite.
[02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:24.360]  Like I started watching that.
[02:03:24.360 --> 02:03:27.040]  And then hearing you guys reference the forums
[02:03:27.040 --> 02:03:27.880]  and I was like, oh,
[02:03:27.880 --> 02:03:29.560]  that's what I was looking at years ago.
[02:03:29.560 --> 02:03:30.800]  And I realized like what they were.
[02:03:30.800 --> 02:03:33.200]  And I instantly like got on Instagram,
[02:03:33.200 --> 02:03:35.320]  realized I could like reach out to these people
[02:03:35.320 --> 02:03:37.800]  cause they weren't stuck up and rude.
[02:03:37.800 --> 02:03:40.400]  Like all these people that I've spoke about,
[02:03:40.400 --> 02:03:42.320]  like all these breeders are very humble,
[02:03:42.320 --> 02:03:43.600]  like awesome, cool people.
[02:03:43.600 --> 02:03:44.760]  You can reach out to them
[02:03:44.760 --> 02:03:47.200]  and they're not like off-putting.
[02:03:47.200 --> 02:03:50.520]  So I just like, I'm young
[02:03:50.520 --> 02:03:52.680]  and the only way I've gotten all this cool stuff
[02:03:52.680 --> 02:03:54.720]  is because of the people that came before me.
[02:03:54.720 --> 02:03:57.800]  And I just want to pay my respects to everybody.
[02:03:57.800 --> 02:03:58.960]  That's awesome, man.
[02:03:58.960 --> 02:03:59.800]  That's awesome.
[02:03:59.800 --> 02:04:02.360]  And you know, being respectful
[02:04:02.360 --> 02:04:03.480]  and like JJ told you,
[02:04:03.480 --> 02:04:05.080]  just don't be an asshole.
[02:04:05.840 --> 02:04:06.680]  And we're good.
[02:04:06.680 --> 02:04:09.640]  You know, it's actually really simple
[02:04:09.640 --> 02:04:12.880]  to like get along with some of these people
[02:04:12.880 --> 02:04:14.720]  and just like have access to it.
[02:04:14.720 --> 02:04:17.240]  Which is like, yeah, just don't sell my stuff.
[02:04:17.240 --> 02:04:18.760]  Don't be an asshole.
[02:04:18.760 --> 02:04:21.240]  But you mentioned wins there.
[02:04:21.240 --> 02:04:22.280]  You won a couple of seats.
[02:04:22.280 --> 02:04:25.240]  I've had a little bit of luck myself
[02:04:25.240 --> 02:04:27.800]  since the last one with B. Leaf.
[02:04:27.800 --> 02:04:31.160]  B. Leaf does some Friday night giveaways
[02:04:31.160 --> 02:04:34.200]  and I won two weeks in a row.
[02:04:34.320 --> 02:04:36.600]  He does a name that strain thing.
[02:04:36.600 --> 02:04:37.440]  And let's see here.
[02:04:37.440 --> 02:04:40.240]  So this one was from one week.
[02:04:40.240 --> 02:04:42.160]  I tell you, I can't focus.
[02:04:42.160 --> 02:04:44.160]  That's what my teachers always told me.
[02:04:45.200 --> 02:04:46.680]  So, okay, I'm just going to tell you,
[02:04:46.680 --> 02:04:48.320]  it's an OG truffle,
[02:04:48.320 --> 02:04:49.640]  which is actually,
[02:04:49.640 --> 02:04:52.880]  it's his white truffle times kush.
[02:04:52.880 --> 02:04:54.480]  So the white truffle times kush,
[02:04:54.480 --> 02:04:55.520]  the OG truffle.
[02:04:55.520 --> 02:04:57.360]  Oh, that was almost focusing.
[02:04:57.360 --> 02:04:58.200]  Fuck it.
[02:04:58.200 --> 02:04:59.080]  Okay.
[02:04:59.080 --> 02:05:02.280]  And then Love Jam on it was the second week.
[02:05:02.280 --> 02:05:03.800]  I named two of his strains.
[02:05:04.440 --> 02:05:05.280]  What is that?
[02:05:05.280 --> 02:05:06.120]  Name it.
[02:05:06.120 --> 02:05:08.640]  One was like flux capacitor and the other one,
[02:05:09.560 --> 02:05:11.520]  God, I forgot what the other name was.
[02:05:11.520 --> 02:05:12.360]  I have it written down,
[02:05:12.360 --> 02:05:17.120]  but this one is Jelly Breath BX one times his dip and sticks.
[02:05:17.120 --> 02:05:20.680]  And he actually told me last week too,
[02:05:20.680 --> 02:05:21.640]  that I'm pretty stoked.
[02:05:21.640 --> 02:05:26.640]  So I guess I have originated a clone only now.
[02:05:28.480 --> 02:05:31.080]  I was going through some of his Kool-Aid man stuff
[02:05:31.120 --> 02:05:34.840]  and I found what I think is a winner.
[02:05:34.840 --> 02:05:36.840]  It checks all the boxes for me.
[02:05:36.840 --> 02:05:38.120]  Here's a picture of it.
[02:05:40.280 --> 02:05:42.640]  So it was the Kool-Aid man,
[02:05:42.640 --> 02:05:45.880]  and I was pretty stoked with it.
[02:05:45.880 --> 02:05:49.280]  He somehow magically wound up with a cut of it
[02:05:49.280 --> 02:05:51.840]  and has now grown that out
[02:05:51.840 --> 02:05:54.480]  and cross that with his white truffle.
[02:05:54.480 --> 02:05:56.760]  So that should be a release
[02:05:56.760 --> 02:06:00.600]  that's coming out here soon too from him.
[02:06:01.120 --> 02:06:03.240]  I don't know how I'm involved with that one,
[02:06:03.240 --> 02:06:04.560]  but I got the cut man.
[02:06:04.560 --> 02:06:06.560]  The cut is what he used to make that.
[02:06:06.560 --> 02:06:08.960]  So I guess, hey, I've got a clone only now.
[02:06:08.960 --> 02:06:10.200]  Woo!
[02:06:10.200 --> 02:06:12.240]  I can play.
[02:06:12.240 --> 02:06:14.400]  I am part of the game.
[02:06:14.400 --> 02:06:15.560]  So that's cool.
[02:06:15.560 --> 02:06:16.440]  But these, yeah,
[02:06:16.440 --> 02:06:18.840]  so these were a couple that I won on the giveaways
[02:06:18.840 --> 02:06:22.280]  from Bee Leaf, excited to run those out.
[02:06:22.280 --> 02:06:27.280]  But those really are all that I've kind of picked up
[02:06:27.560 --> 02:06:29.960]  since our last seed collectors episode,
[02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:31.360]  which wasn't that long ago,
[02:06:31.360 --> 02:06:33.800]  but that's it.
[02:06:33.800 --> 02:06:34.720]  And again, one more time,
[02:06:34.720 --> 02:06:36.560]  I'm gonna shout out Skunk Ape,
[02:06:36.560 --> 02:06:40.680]  Skunk Ape Glassworks for the fantastic piece
[02:06:40.680 --> 02:06:42.000]  that he sent as well.
[02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.920]  So that's what I've collected, man.
[02:06:44.920 --> 02:06:49.920]  You got any more that you wanted to show there, Trevor,
[02:06:50.360 --> 02:06:53.040]  or that you're excited to pop next year?
[02:06:53.040 --> 02:06:54.680]  Because I know you go to these events
[02:06:54.680 --> 02:06:56.520]  and I tell you, honestly,
[02:06:56.520 --> 02:06:58.480]  if I ran into you and I had a pack full of seeds,
[02:06:58.520 --> 02:07:00.880]  I'd shove them in your pocket as fast as I could.
[02:07:00.880 --> 02:07:04.720]  So I'm sure you got a few going on over there.
[02:07:04.720 --> 02:07:08.040]  Yeah, I've got,
[02:07:08.040 --> 02:07:09.280]  well, I've got these,
[02:07:09.280 --> 02:07:12.440]  and these are things that I'm just waiting to pop.
[02:07:13.960 --> 02:07:18.960]  It's the Bruce Weed from Gold Coast.
[02:07:19.880 --> 02:07:20.720]  Nice.
[02:07:22.120 --> 02:07:25.920]  The Skunk Oil,
[02:07:25.960 --> 02:07:30.280]  it's a Rubber Chem Fire D
[02:07:32.480 --> 02:07:36.080]  reversal of a bunch of different stuff.
[02:07:37.760 --> 02:07:40.360]  The Manic White Rhino.
[02:07:41.440 --> 02:07:43.200]  White Rhino's a classic.
[02:07:43.200 --> 02:07:44.040]  Oh yeah.
[02:07:45.920 --> 02:07:50.040]  Then, and the Manic, he's got the legit Manic.
[02:07:50.040 --> 02:07:52.800]  There was controversy about that back in the day.
[02:07:53.800 --> 02:07:56.160]  Then this is the Mai Tai.
[02:07:57.960 --> 02:08:01.880]  His Lemon crossed a Mango Haze in a Cambodian Tai.
[02:08:04.240 --> 02:08:06.880]  Yeah, Gold Coast stuff is wild.
[02:08:06.880 --> 02:08:08.400]  That stuff that I'm,
[02:08:09.280 --> 02:08:10.760]  I'm gonna back everything up.
[02:08:10.760 --> 02:08:15.760]  It's kind of like with that Sensi Star Puck.
[02:08:15.800 --> 02:08:17.200]  You wanna back everything up
[02:08:17.200 --> 02:08:20.080]  and make sure that you save everything, make seeds.
[02:08:20.920 --> 02:08:23.400]  Keep it around because these things,
[02:08:23.400 --> 02:08:26.840]  these Puck Back Crosses I have from crickets and cicadas,
[02:08:26.840 --> 02:08:28.800]  they're things that I just,
[02:08:28.800 --> 02:08:32.520]  I'll pop and I wanna actually keep around.
[02:08:32.520 --> 02:08:34.520]  I wanna select males from them.
[02:08:34.520 --> 02:08:36.720]  I wanna reproduce the population.
[02:08:36.720 --> 02:08:39.480]  I'll just make a open pollination
[02:08:39.480 --> 02:08:42.040]  with all the males and all the females, ideally.
[02:08:43.640 --> 02:08:44.800]  And then there are other things
[02:08:44.800 --> 02:08:47.880]  where I just wanna grow them out and see what they do.
[02:08:48.320 --> 02:08:51.360]  And yeah, so those are some things
[02:08:51.360 --> 02:08:52.680]  that I'm pretty stoked on.
[02:08:52.680 --> 02:08:55.400]  I also got these, which I'm very stoked on.
[02:08:56.400 --> 02:08:57.480]  I know you had one.
[02:08:57.480 --> 02:08:58.960]  Yeah, One Love.
[02:08:58.960 --> 02:09:03.640]  Yeah, so I got the GDP Air Horn.
[02:09:03.640 --> 02:09:06.800]  So we talked about GDP tonight.
[02:09:06.800 --> 02:09:08.440]  I'm stoked on those.
[02:09:08.440 --> 02:09:11.480]  I think this is the pack that I'm gonna pop this year
[02:09:11.480 --> 02:09:13.720]  from the ones that I got from them.
[02:09:13.720 --> 02:09:15.440]  I was looking at that pack too.
[02:09:15.480 --> 02:09:17.840]  I was like, ooh, what do I do?
[02:09:17.840 --> 02:09:19.440]  What do I do?
[02:09:19.440 --> 02:09:21.600]  Yeah, that GDP, man.
[02:09:21.600 --> 02:09:23.040]  That's an elusive.
[02:09:23.040 --> 02:09:27.440]  But it all goes back to the right person who's got it.
[02:09:27.440 --> 02:09:29.480]  I have no idea what this is.
[02:09:30.480 --> 02:09:34.200]  Like Dave didn't even wanna really give it to me.
[02:09:34.200 --> 02:09:37.000]  He had just made them and they were something
[02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:39.760]  that he was like, I shouldn't even do this.
[02:09:39.760 --> 02:09:44.360]  And he like, he wrote some completely unintelligible,
[02:09:44.400 --> 02:09:47.560]  illegible thing, but he knows what it is.
[02:09:47.560 --> 02:09:48.840]  And I know him.
[02:09:48.840 --> 02:09:52.480]  So, but I've got that one.
[02:09:52.480 --> 02:09:55.400]  And that one was something that was like,
[02:09:55.400 --> 02:10:00.040]  he was so much like, should I give him these?
[02:10:00.040 --> 02:10:00.880]  Should I not?
[02:10:00.880 --> 02:10:02.080]  And he gave them to me.
[02:10:02.080 --> 02:10:05.240]  But those I'm gonna pop with a lot of care
[02:10:05.240 --> 02:10:09.280]  and make sure everything's backed up and all that goodness.
[02:10:10.720 --> 02:10:11.560]  That's awesome, man.
[02:10:11.560 --> 02:10:12.800]  Well, thank you for doing that.
[02:10:12.800 --> 02:10:14.720]  Thank you for preserving these things
[02:10:14.720 --> 02:10:18.480]  because it does, especially when you're outdoor, man,
[02:10:18.480 --> 02:10:19.880]  that's your whole season.
[02:10:19.880 --> 02:10:23.200]  I'm looking at trying to do a couple of projects here
[02:10:23.200 --> 02:10:25.720]  and you just do the math on how long it takes
[02:10:25.720 --> 02:10:28.240]  and how long you won't be producing.
[02:10:28.240 --> 02:10:29.880]  Like, you know, that quality bud
[02:10:29.880 --> 02:10:31.680]  that you can just pull and smoke.
[02:10:31.680 --> 02:10:35.280]  You gotta take seeds out of and it's a commitment.
[02:10:35.280 --> 02:10:37.120]  So I'm glad you're doing that.
[02:10:37.120 --> 02:10:39.320]  So thank you for doing that.
[02:10:39.320 --> 02:10:40.280]  Appreciate that.
[02:10:40.280 --> 02:10:41.960]  Yeah, thank you for having me on.
[02:10:41.960 --> 02:10:44.240]  And also got a,
[02:10:47.520 --> 02:10:48.360]  where is it?
[02:10:48.360 --> 02:10:49.200]  Where's the camera?
[02:10:49.200 --> 02:10:50.760]  Here we go.
[02:10:50.760 --> 02:10:53.720]  Masonic, I got the featuring crosses.
[02:10:55.560 --> 02:10:58.200]  You were just down on his podcast.
[02:10:58.200 --> 02:11:01.480]  So you probably got the hook up, huh?
[02:11:01.480 --> 02:11:06.480]  Yeah, honestly, I didn't really get a lot from him
[02:11:06.720 --> 02:11:09.560]  when I was down there, just cause we weren't like on that.
[02:11:09.560 --> 02:11:14.560]  We were at the shop and it was like a in and out quick thing
[02:11:14.800 --> 02:11:19.800]  on the podcast, but then we had like a really awesome sesh
[02:11:19.840 --> 02:11:21.640]  and it was awesome.
[02:11:21.640 --> 02:11:26.640]  Cause so we started out and it was crazy weather.
[02:11:28.160 --> 02:11:31.080]  I picked up the ranch cause I was in San Diego
[02:11:31.080 --> 02:11:33.200]  doing like Lego land shit.
[02:11:33.200 --> 02:11:38.200]  And so we were doing Lego land and I had talked to Mason.
[02:11:39.160 --> 02:11:41.160]  I said, I was going to be in San Diego.
[02:11:41.160 --> 02:11:42.880]  Like let's meet up.
[02:11:42.880 --> 02:11:44.400]  And he was like, yeah, come through.
[02:11:44.400 --> 02:11:45.720]  We'll record an episode.
[02:11:45.720 --> 02:11:49.800]  So I hit him up and he's like, yeah, like we're good.
[02:11:49.800 --> 02:11:51.400]  Let's do it.
[02:11:51.400 --> 02:11:54.600]  Then the weather the next morning when we got up was like,
[02:11:54.600 --> 02:11:56.360]  we knew it was going to be like bad weather,
[02:11:56.360 --> 02:11:59.200]  but they were reporting like really, really bad.
[02:11:59.200 --> 02:12:00.800]  And big proportions.
[02:12:00.800 --> 02:12:01.800]  Yeah.
[02:12:01.800 --> 02:12:05.800]  And so everybody was like, are you sharing?
[02:12:05.840 --> 02:12:08.680]  Where I was, it was like Lego land.
[02:12:08.680 --> 02:12:10.960]  Carlsbad area was like clear.
[02:12:10.960 --> 02:12:12.080]  It wasn't really that bad.
[02:12:12.080 --> 02:12:13.420]  It was kind of legit there.
[02:12:13.420 --> 02:12:16.160]  So I was like, it's fine where I'm at.
[02:12:16.160 --> 02:12:17.240]  So let's do this.
[02:12:17.240 --> 02:12:18.440]  And they were all still down.
[02:12:18.440 --> 02:12:23.440]  So I smashed up, pick up ranch, buddy, King Air.
[02:12:23.560 --> 02:12:26.680]  We go up, you know.
[02:12:29.160 --> 02:12:33.400]  The Malawi, it got them.
[02:12:33.400 --> 02:12:37.280]  Like three, four blunts deep, a couple of joints.
[02:12:37.280 --> 02:12:42.280]  And then we get up, we record the episode.
[02:12:42.520 --> 02:12:44.920]  Brandon shows up from third gen.
[02:12:44.920 --> 02:12:48.440]  He pulls up and he records an episode.
[02:12:48.440 --> 02:12:51.480]  His episodes fucking incredible.
[02:12:51.480 --> 02:12:54.720]  It's worth the cost of entry for exclusive stuff
[02:12:54.720 --> 02:12:57.840]  on Masonix, Patreon, nine bucks.
[02:12:57.840 --> 02:13:01.560]  Fully, fully worth it because Brandon's episode alone,
[02:13:01.560 --> 02:13:03.760]  like it was that good.
[02:13:03.760 --> 02:13:05.720]  Dude was on fire.
[02:13:07.680 --> 02:13:09.580]  So Brandon was legit.
[02:13:09.580 --> 02:13:14.160]  We fucking, you know, I did mine, he did his.
[02:13:14.160 --> 02:13:19.160]  Then we went down more blunts, incredible Z-Turps,
[02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:23.480]  fucking full on, all the homies were there.
[02:13:25.040 --> 02:13:29.560]  Otis, Otis was there, always helping with FCP.
[02:13:29.560 --> 02:13:34.560]  And he was also, he had some Skycuddler Kush that we smoked
[02:13:34.920 --> 02:13:38.680]  that was from the F4s that I had made or helped make.
[02:13:38.680 --> 02:13:40.800]  A number of us were in on that.
[02:13:40.800 --> 02:13:44.160]  And so he had grown a bunch out
[02:13:44.160 --> 02:13:46.400]  and he brought some of that, we smoked it.
[02:13:46.400 --> 02:13:48.880]  We smoked a whole bunch of his flower
[02:13:48.880 --> 02:13:51.640]  with the Skittles cross.
[02:13:51.640 --> 02:13:55.560]  And so yeah, it was good times.
[02:13:55.560 --> 02:14:00.560]  And then, yeah, that was-
[02:14:00.720 --> 02:14:02.240]  Wild weather though.
[02:14:02.240 --> 02:14:03.240]  It was wild weather.
[02:14:03.240 --> 02:14:07.920]  It was so wild, but it was fully worth it to go through.
[02:14:07.920 --> 02:14:08.940]  Crazy ass weather.
[02:14:08.940 --> 02:14:13.040]  We were driving behind somebody who had a vanity plate
[02:14:13.040 --> 02:14:14.580]  that was a sativa.
[02:14:17.120 --> 02:14:19.520]  We were rolling, like mobbing up there
[02:14:19.520 --> 02:14:22.040]  and it was totally worth it.
[02:14:22.040 --> 02:14:25.640]  And yeah, so check out Masonic's Patreon.
[02:14:25.640 --> 02:14:28.280]  Also, he's got some of my seeds.
[02:14:28.280 --> 02:14:33.200]  He's got the Donnie Burger TKM 10 cross up on his site.
[02:14:33.200 --> 02:14:36.200]  So I know Peter's got some stuff.
[02:14:36.200 --> 02:14:38.520]  I'm gonna have more stuff for both of them.
[02:14:38.520 --> 02:14:41.080]  I'm gonna come back down to LA later this month.
[02:14:41.080 --> 02:14:45.600]  And yeah, so it's good times.
[02:14:45.600 --> 02:14:48.160]  Now, I know what names should they look for,
[02:14:48.160 --> 02:14:49.560]  for those seeds?
[02:14:49.560 --> 02:14:51.200]  What are those under?
[02:14:51.200 --> 02:14:52.480]  It's the double double.
[02:14:54.480 --> 02:14:56.640]  Or is it two buck Chuck or two bucks?
[02:14:56.640 --> 02:14:58.360]  Well, it's two bucks, yeah.
[02:14:58.360 --> 02:14:59.440]  Yeah, sorry.
[02:14:59.440 --> 02:15:02.400]  Yeah, but I mean, it's got Chuck's face on it.
[02:15:02.400 --> 02:15:03.520]  So, you know.
[02:15:03.520 --> 02:15:04.680]  Mr. Barkley, yes.
[02:15:04.680 --> 02:15:05.840]  Staying on brand.
[02:15:07.360 --> 02:15:08.560]  Awesome.
[02:15:08.560 --> 02:15:11.800]  Well, shit, Dog Days, I wanna say thank you as well
[02:15:11.800 --> 02:15:13.960]  for coming and kind of showing us some of those mothers.
[02:15:13.960 --> 02:15:17.500]  Did you have a couple favorites
[02:15:17.500 --> 02:15:20.280]  that you wanted to just tell us about before we go
[02:15:20.360 --> 02:15:23.600]  or maybe show us a couple of the favorites
[02:15:23.600 --> 02:15:25.080]  in the boardroom real quick?
[02:15:25.080 --> 02:15:28.560]  The sour diesel is always gonna be my favorite, man.
[02:15:28.560 --> 02:15:31.800]  Like specifically the plant that my grandma gave me
[02:15:31.800 --> 02:15:34.800]  because I love my grandma, man.
[02:15:34.800 --> 02:15:37.000]  She's a dear, sweet old woman.
[02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.480]  And I'm sure everyone has a sweet old grandma,
[02:15:39.480 --> 02:15:41.160]  but mine taught me how to take clones
[02:15:41.160 --> 02:15:42.400]  and gave me sour diesel.
[02:15:42.400 --> 02:15:44.200]  And I'd go through the death for that.
[02:15:44.200 --> 02:15:46.800]  And so that plant has a special place in my heart.
[02:15:46.800 --> 02:15:49.240]  And that's why I'm growing.
[02:15:49.240 --> 02:15:50.720]  I got four different sours
[02:15:50.720 --> 02:15:53.200]  and I got three different original diesels going.
[02:15:54.520 --> 02:15:58.800]  I got two of the sours in flower right now.
[02:15:58.800 --> 02:16:00.520]  I got the one my grandma gave me
[02:16:00.520 --> 02:16:02.760]  and then I got the East Coast sour.
[02:16:02.760 --> 02:16:03.760]  Look, I can't.
[02:16:05.600 --> 02:16:06.720]  Yeah, no worries.
[02:16:06.720 --> 02:16:09.560]  Yeah, you know, sour, I mean, that's one that,
[02:16:09.560 --> 02:16:10.540]  ooh, dang.
[02:16:12.200 --> 02:16:13.040]  That's a cool-
[02:16:13.040 --> 02:16:14.240]  They're not the happiest.
[02:16:14.240 --> 02:16:16.160]  I just switched to organics.
[02:16:16.160 --> 02:16:18.120]  The flower, I've learned with organics
[02:16:18.480 --> 02:16:21.000]  when they're yellow and sour yellow is out anyway.
[02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:22.440]  But if they're a little underfed,
[02:16:22.440 --> 02:16:24.480]  the flower still comes out pretty good.
[02:16:24.480 --> 02:16:26.620]  I just lose out on my yield a little bit.
[02:16:26.620 --> 02:16:29.800]  But that's the sour my grandma gave me right there.
[02:16:29.800 --> 02:16:30.640]  And I love it.
[02:16:30.640 --> 02:16:32.720]  And then this is the East Coast sour diesel.
[02:16:32.720 --> 02:16:35.960]  I got it as a ECSD from a good friend,
[02:16:35.960 --> 02:16:37.240]  Straight A Genetics.
[02:16:42.120 --> 02:16:44.240]  Is it true that Soma's East Coast sour diesel
[02:16:44.240 --> 02:16:46.240]  has no sour diesel in it?
[02:16:46.640 --> 02:16:50.320]  Soma's is the New York City diesel, the NYCD.
[02:16:50.320 --> 02:16:52.200]  This is the ECSD.
[02:16:52.200 --> 02:16:55.880]  I just got another cut past his ECSD
[02:16:55.880 --> 02:16:58.420]  and it's also tagged as the Rez cut.
[02:16:58.420 --> 02:17:01.040]  So it's supposed to be the cut that Rez used
[02:17:01.040 --> 02:17:02.200]  to make his line.
[02:17:02.200 --> 02:17:03.880]  So I'll see if they're the same.
[02:17:03.880 --> 02:17:07.840]  This one was, some of the variegation's gone away.
[02:17:07.840 --> 02:17:10.120]  Let me see if I can find some.
[02:17:10.120 --> 02:17:12.160]  It's right next to the ChemD also.
[02:17:12.160 --> 02:17:15.200]  So you saw the ChemD mom that had no variegation.
[02:17:15.200 --> 02:17:17.680]  This is the ChemD, same ChemD.
[02:17:17.680 --> 02:17:21.640]  Like I got her cleaned up, but beautiful plant.
[02:17:21.640 --> 02:17:25.000]  And this is day 32 of flower.
[02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:27.160]  But yeah, this East Coast sour diesel
[02:17:27.160 --> 02:17:28.560]  was variegated as well.
[02:17:28.560 --> 02:17:30.360]  And then if I walk in the tank,
[02:17:31.560 --> 02:17:36.560]  blue service, but that tall one back there is diesel.
[02:17:36.920 --> 02:17:38.080]  They also call it old diesel.
[02:17:38.080 --> 02:17:40.760]  It's the one that Skunk Tech and J Trees grow.
[02:17:40.760 --> 02:17:43.440]  I hit up Skunk Tech about it and he said that,
[02:17:43.440 --> 02:17:46.880]  I think he got it in Vermont in like 2001.
[02:17:46.880 --> 02:17:49.600]  And, but it was, I think it was supposed to have came
[02:17:49.600 --> 02:17:51.400]  from Jersey supposedly.
[02:17:52.360 --> 02:17:53.800]  Pretty sure that's what he had told me.
[02:17:53.800 --> 02:17:55.360]  But yeah, I really liked that one.
[02:17:55.360 --> 02:17:58.080]  That one is stacking up really fat,
[02:17:58.080 --> 02:17:59.740]  but that plant isn't on a bucket.
[02:17:59.740 --> 02:18:01.600]  It's pretty damn tall.
[02:18:01.600 --> 02:18:05.160]  I got a double trellis and I like it.
[02:18:05.160 --> 02:18:07.080]  It, when you get up close to it,
[02:18:07.080 --> 02:18:09.880]  you can really see like the sour and the structure
[02:18:09.880 --> 02:18:11.380]  it's kind of boxed in and out.
[02:18:11.700 --> 02:18:14.940]  It looks like Chem 91 quite a bit.
[02:18:14.940 --> 02:18:17.900]  The, like the leaves on it look a lot like Chem 91.
[02:18:19.780 --> 02:18:21.760]  And then this, I got the dog walker.
[02:18:22.660 --> 02:18:25.540]  I really liked this dog walker OG a lot as well.
[02:18:25.540 --> 02:18:26.380]  It's a,
[02:18:29.540 --> 02:18:31.460]  sorry I'm on my phone.
[02:18:31.460 --> 02:18:34.420]  But, oh, and this one, this is another new one.
[02:18:34.420 --> 02:18:35.580]  I haven't got the smoke yet.
[02:18:35.580 --> 02:18:36.620]  It's my first time running it,
[02:18:36.620 --> 02:18:39.560]  but it's this, the Maui skunk dog.
[02:18:39.560 --> 02:18:42.760]  And it's supposed, I've heard a few different things
[02:18:42.760 --> 02:18:45.000]  on what the skunk component could be,
[02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:48.080]  but it's supposed to be the Maui dog
[02:18:48.080 --> 02:18:50.360]  crossed to Molokai skunk,
[02:18:50.360 --> 02:18:54.060]  which that Maui dog is supposed to be a bag seed
[02:18:54.060 --> 02:18:56.200]  out of Chem 91, supposedly.
[02:18:57.520 --> 02:19:01.740]  And then this is the Tahoe OG cut that I got.
[02:19:03.160 --> 02:19:05.120]  I believe this is skunk text cut.
[02:19:05.120 --> 02:19:07.080]  That's what I was told.
[02:19:07.080 --> 02:19:09.280]  I really like it compared to some of the other OGs
[02:19:09.960 --> 02:19:10.800]  that I've grown.
[02:19:10.800 --> 02:19:12.480]  The TK is a pain in the ass to grow.
[02:19:12.480 --> 02:19:13.620]  It's really floppy.
[02:19:13.620 --> 02:19:15.960]  I feel like I'll do much better on my next run.
[02:19:15.960 --> 02:19:17.560]  The bud is amazing, man.
[02:19:17.560 --> 02:19:20.440]  There's nothing really that hits with that potency,
[02:19:20.440 --> 02:19:22.380]  maybe except like the Chem D,
[02:19:22.380 --> 02:19:24.240]  but it's so lanky and just,
[02:19:25.440 --> 02:19:27.880]  I yielded good on it because it was such a huge plant.
[02:19:27.880 --> 02:19:29.720]  And I like, I, it's strong.
[02:19:29.720 --> 02:19:31.120]  Like I weeded it through the trellis,
[02:19:31.120 --> 02:19:32.920]  which I don't usually like to do.
[02:19:32.920 --> 02:19:34.200]  And so I got a lot of flower,
[02:19:34.200 --> 02:19:36.840]  but it was just kind of a pain to grow.
[02:19:36.840 --> 02:19:39.320]  And this OG right here,
[02:19:39.320 --> 02:19:43.360]  this thing's a little more squat and not all floppy.
[02:19:43.360 --> 02:19:45.240]  And it's just stacking.
[02:19:45.240 --> 02:19:48.160]  It's already putting a lot of resin on.
[02:19:48.160 --> 02:19:50.580]  I'm not too big on like seeing resin on the leaves.
[02:19:50.580 --> 02:19:52.360]  That TK wasn't, like,
[02:19:52.360 --> 02:19:54.480]  I'm sure it would have had more resin if I grew it better,
[02:19:54.480 --> 02:19:56.080]  but the leaves, like,
[02:19:56.080 --> 02:19:58.080]  it didn't have crazy resin rails
[02:19:58.080 --> 02:19:59.280]  out the edges of the leaves.
[02:19:59.280 --> 02:20:02.240]  It had a lot of resin on the flower.
[02:20:02.240 --> 02:20:03.320]  And that's something I've seen
[02:20:03.320 --> 02:20:05.820]  with some of these plants that I like to smoke.
[02:20:05.820 --> 02:20:07.380]  I mean, maybe I don't grow them the best.
[02:20:07.380 --> 02:20:08.980]  I think I grow them decent at least,
[02:20:08.980 --> 02:20:11.220]  but they don't get like crazy resin
[02:20:11.220 --> 02:20:13.100]  going all the way out to the leaves.
[02:20:13.100 --> 02:20:15.140]  They build a lot of their resin on the flower.
[02:20:15.140 --> 02:20:16.580]  And I kind of like that.
[02:20:16.580 --> 02:20:20.740]  But yeah, I like these plants that I got so far.
[02:20:20.740 --> 02:20:22.680]  Oh, back there.
[02:20:22.680 --> 02:20:24.680]  This is one of the oldest plants I have.
[02:20:25.660 --> 02:20:27.900]  That's the, that's the dog shit.
[02:20:27.900 --> 02:20:29.060]  Can you still hear me?
[02:20:29.060 --> 02:20:30.180]  Yes. Yeah.
[02:20:30.180 --> 02:20:31.020]  Dog shit, man.
[02:20:31.020 --> 02:20:33.000]  That was one that for 20 years,
[02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:34.980]  I didn't know if it was made up or not.
[02:20:36.020 --> 02:20:38.860]  Yeah, it's the Pacific Northwest dog shit.
[02:20:38.860 --> 02:20:41.780]  It's supposed to be like an NL5 haze from,
[02:20:41.780 --> 02:20:43.220]  I think it's from 1989.
[02:20:43.220 --> 02:20:46.500]  And it was originally called the electric boogaloo,
[02:20:46.500 --> 02:20:49.180]  but I'm really excited to grow that one.
[02:20:49.180 --> 02:20:52.140]  I'm not, I haven't grown a whole lot of like,
[02:20:52.140 --> 02:20:54.860]  quote unquote sativas, you know,
[02:20:54.860 --> 02:20:57.540]  like equatorials that have a more, you know,
[02:20:57.540 --> 02:20:59.260]  with the more racy effect.
[02:20:59.260 --> 02:21:04.260]  And I really liked that pineapple express that we grew.
[02:21:04.580 --> 02:21:06.260]  And that pineapple express wasn't,
[02:21:06.260 --> 02:21:09.060]  didn't have like the growth traits of an equatorial
[02:21:09.060 --> 02:21:09.900]  or anything like that.
[02:21:09.900 --> 02:21:14.420]  It grew pretty squat, more like an Afghan type of structure.
[02:21:14.420 --> 02:21:16.900]  It was real, like real squat, didn't get tall at all.
[02:21:16.900 --> 02:21:19.340]  And it grew some pretty fat, chunky buds.
[02:21:19.340 --> 02:21:22.220]  But I loved the high from it, the way that it was like,
[02:21:22.220 --> 02:21:24.260]  I love the unique nuance
[02:21:24.260 --> 02:21:26.500]  and the different effects of cannabis.
[02:21:26.500 --> 02:21:28.360]  I love having several different jars
[02:21:28.360 --> 02:21:29.400]  that do a different thing.
[02:21:29.400 --> 02:21:32.820]  So yeah, I got that old super silver haze cut
[02:21:32.820 --> 02:21:34.260]  that I showed you in the mom room.
[02:21:34.260 --> 02:21:37.420]  It's the old, old songs, cut a super silver haze.
[02:21:37.420 --> 02:21:38.980]  And I got that dog shit.
[02:21:38.980 --> 02:21:40.420]  And so those are the,
[02:21:40.420 --> 02:21:43.580]  make the more longer flowering equatorial
[02:21:43.580 --> 02:21:45.540]  with kind of, should hopefully have a different effect
[02:21:45.540 --> 02:21:46.380]  to them.
[02:21:46.380 --> 02:21:48.940]  I don't have really any experience growing plants
[02:21:48.940 --> 02:21:49.760]  like that till now.
[02:21:49.760 --> 02:21:51.340]  So it's been kind of cool.
[02:21:51.340 --> 02:21:53.700]  It's going to be a guessing game on like when to cut it.
[02:21:53.700 --> 02:21:56.700]  I'm shooting for like 90 days ish on it.
[02:21:56.700 --> 02:21:57.540]  Yeah. Yeah.
[02:21:57.540 --> 02:22:00.500]  You know, you'll read the plant and then like any, anything,
[02:22:00.500 --> 02:22:02.420]  the more you do it, the better you'll get at it.
[02:22:03.260 --> 02:22:05.460]  Yeah. I like to have a variety too.
[02:22:05.460 --> 02:22:06.700]  That's why I always have,
[02:22:06.700 --> 02:22:08.460]  I've got to have at least, you know,
[02:22:08.460 --> 02:22:11.700]  two handfuls of varieties in my drawer
[02:22:11.700 --> 02:22:14.420]  because I like to change it up and I kind of smoke all day.
[02:22:14.420 --> 02:22:17.180]  So I hear you there, but definitely,
[02:22:17.180 --> 02:22:20.060]  I want to thank you both for coming and sharing
[02:22:20.060 --> 02:22:21.460]  and dropping some knowledge, man.
[02:22:21.460 --> 02:22:23.560]  I really appreciate your time.
[02:22:23.560 --> 02:22:27.580]  And I will say just kind of on the tail end,
[02:22:27.580 --> 02:22:29.180]  we're talking preservation.
[02:22:30.180 --> 02:22:31.260]  I'll throw in here.
[02:22:31.260 --> 02:22:34.900]  I wrote it down earlier, being a flower guy,
[02:22:34.900 --> 02:22:36.660]  not really being a concentrate guy.
[02:22:36.660 --> 02:22:38.820]  You know, you had mentioned earlier, Trevor,
[02:22:38.820 --> 02:22:41.020]  that the, you know, the heads, it was really greasy.
[02:22:41.020 --> 02:22:42.220]  And I'm like, ah, well, you know,
[02:22:42.220 --> 02:22:44.900]  greasy is kind of going out of style because, well,
[02:22:44.900 --> 02:22:46.700]  it doesn't wash well.
[02:22:46.700 --> 02:22:50.140]  Pay attention, preserve those greasy strains,
[02:22:50.140 --> 02:22:51.980]  those ones that are worth keeping, man.
[02:22:51.980 --> 02:22:53.780]  Don't, don't abandon them.
[02:22:53.780 --> 02:22:55.740]  Everybody, I'm putting that in your head right now.
[02:22:55.740 --> 02:22:57.820]  Don't let some of the good greasy strains go away
[02:22:57.820 --> 02:23:00.620]  because I'm a flower guy and there are some out there.
[02:23:00.740 --> 02:23:02.420]  They don't wash the best, but like-
[02:23:02.420 --> 02:23:03.260]  Everything goes to concentrate.
[02:23:03.260 --> 02:23:06.340]  I love making hand rub out of like cherry.
[02:23:06.340 --> 02:23:09.820]  You don't get too much sometimes, but like the TK,
[02:23:09.820 --> 02:23:12.860]  the sour and the cherry pie, like all these plants,
[02:23:12.860 --> 02:23:16.260]  I love making hand rub hash and just a little bit
[02:23:16.260 --> 02:23:21.020]  of dry sift that I collect through my trim bin is like primo.
[02:23:21.020 --> 02:23:23.820]  Yeah, yeah, I've got, yeah, I do the dry sift.
[02:23:23.820 --> 02:23:25.660]  I got a couple things of,
[02:23:26.660 --> 02:23:30.820]  a couple bins of leaf material I need to wash, but-
[02:23:30.820 --> 02:23:32.260]  I rub trim.
[02:23:32.260 --> 02:23:35.780]  I'll rub all my trim and like, you know,
[02:23:35.780 --> 02:23:37.940]  you'll get like finger hash from trimming.
[02:23:37.940 --> 02:23:41.140]  Like since I'm not like, I'm the only one smoking my flower
[02:23:41.140 --> 02:23:43.960]  and I've gotten like trolled for saying this before,
[02:23:43.960 --> 02:23:45.980]  but I trim a lot of my flower with my hand,
[02:23:45.980 --> 02:23:47.020]  with my bare hand.
[02:23:47.020 --> 02:23:49.700]  Like I wash my hands, but I like to collect finger hash.
[02:23:49.700 --> 02:23:51.540]  Man, I've done that since I was a kid
[02:23:51.540 --> 02:23:53.020]  and that's why I love trimming.
[02:23:53.020 --> 02:23:54.620]  Like I just, I love trimming.
[02:23:55.020 --> 02:23:59.260]  I used to smoke resin, so you know, anything's cool.
[02:23:59.260 --> 02:24:00.900]  The same people that are clowning me
[02:24:00.900 --> 02:24:03.540]  for smoking finger hash used to smoke pipe resin.
[02:24:03.540 --> 02:24:05.980]  So like, none of us are all high and mighty,
[02:24:05.980 --> 02:24:07.420]  but I love doing that.
[02:24:07.420 --> 02:24:09.260]  I'll rub all my trim and like,
[02:24:09.260 --> 02:24:11.020]  I'll save a lot of my small buds
[02:24:11.020 --> 02:24:12.580]  and get good hand rub hash.
[02:24:12.580 --> 02:24:16.580]  And I got like a two gram ball of Trinity hand rub
[02:24:16.580 --> 02:24:19.500]  that I made and I like sealed it up to like make,
[02:24:19.500 --> 02:24:21.340]  you know, make my own kind of temple ball.
[02:24:21.340 --> 02:24:24.260]  I don't know if that's the real way they do temple balls,
[02:24:24.900 --> 02:24:26.260]  but it's kind of what I gathered from it
[02:24:26.260 --> 02:24:29.580]  is you make some hand rub and you seal it up in a ball
[02:24:29.580 --> 02:24:31.900]  and store it in like a cool dry place.
[02:24:31.900 --> 02:24:34.900]  And then I got some dry cists that I'm storing too.
[02:24:35.820 --> 02:24:36.900]  I love that kind of hash.
[02:24:36.900 --> 02:24:39.500]  I don't like dabs or anything like that really.
[02:24:39.500 --> 02:24:40.340]  Me too.
[02:24:40.340 --> 02:24:42.980]  That's why I'm going back to Amsterdam for 420 this year
[02:24:42.980 --> 02:24:45.380]  because I'm going to smoke the good hash there.
[02:24:45.380 --> 02:24:46.980]  You get good hash out there?
[02:24:46.980 --> 02:24:47.860]  Yeah.
[02:24:47.860 --> 02:24:48.700]  Oh, hell yeah.
[02:24:48.700 --> 02:24:49.540]  That I like.
[02:24:49.540 --> 02:24:52.620]  Now, is it a connoisseur quote unquote good hash
[02:24:52.620 --> 02:24:53.540]  in the American market?
[02:24:53.540 --> 02:24:56.300]  No, but it's the kind of hash I like.
[02:24:56.300 --> 02:24:59.220]  It's like your shoe hash, Jack, your pressed hash.
[02:24:59.220 --> 02:25:01.700]  It's from different areas of the world.
[02:25:01.700 --> 02:25:02.540]  I love shoe hash.
[02:25:02.540 --> 02:25:03.660]  Consistency is a little bit different, but no,
[02:25:03.660 --> 02:25:07.220]  it's that traditional kind of dark, dirty hash.
[02:25:07.220 --> 02:25:08.420]  I dig.
[02:25:08.420 --> 02:25:12.020]  But yeah, everybody in chat, thanks for hanging out.
[02:25:12.020 --> 02:25:15.140]  Thanks for coming for another episode of Seed Collectors.

[02:25:18.700 --> 02:25:20.260]  Dave will be here.

[02:25:49.260 --> 02:25:50.100]  You're awesome.

[02:25:52.340 --> 02:25:53.900]  I'll leave you with the knock knock joke
[02:25:53.900 --> 02:25:55.180]  because I'm good with those.
[02:25:55.180 --> 02:25:56.020]  Okay.
[02:25:56.020 --> 02:25:59.340]  So Dog Days, knock knock.
[02:25:59.340 --> 02:26:00.580]  Who's there?
[02:26:00.580 --> 02:26:02.700]  I eat map.
[02:26:02.700 --> 02:26:03.900]  I eat map poo.
[02:26:03.900 --> 02:26:06.300]  Ah, you eat your poo.
[02:26:06.300 --> 02:26:07.140]  Yes.
[02:26:07.140 --> 02:26:09.540]  I smoked enough for you to really get me with that one.
[02:26:09.540 --> 02:26:11.780]  You look a lot higher than Trevor, so it worked.
[02:26:11.780 --> 02:26:12.620]  Yeah.
[02:26:12.620 --> 02:26:14.340]  I caught it like right at the end.
[02:26:14.340 --> 02:26:16.300]  I was like, oh man, he made me say it.
