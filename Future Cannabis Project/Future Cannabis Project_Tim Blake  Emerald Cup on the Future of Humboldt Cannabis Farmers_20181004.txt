[00:00.000 --> 00:04.120]  I want to now turn it over to Tim, who had a very interesting perspective on taxes and
[00:04.120 --> 00:07.960]  issues dealing with the farms up north and what's happening to them because of the tax
[00:07.960 --> 00:09.440]  crunch, for lack of a better word.
[00:09.440 --> 00:13.000]  So if you could kind of explain what's going on and how you're seeing that world right
[00:13.000 --> 00:16.080]  now, because to me it was fascinating, because being in Southern California and dealing with
[00:16.080 --> 00:20.680]  a lot of indoor growers and distributors and banks, I'm not seeing the landscape that you're
[00:20.680 --> 00:23.320]  seeing in the trenches.
[00:23.320 --> 00:27.080]  Well, it's even larger than a tax issue.
[00:27.080 --> 00:29.600]  It's a calamity.
[00:30.400 --> 00:36.600]  Four years ago, we brought up about 400 people to Eureka to have a gathering of the supervisors
[00:36.600 --> 00:39.040]  in the fire department, everybody to talk about how we're going to embrace cannabis.
[00:39.040 --> 00:40.600]  And there was a standing ovation at the end.
[00:40.600 --> 00:42.600]  It was an incredible experience.
[00:42.600 --> 00:47.280]  Last week, the BCC came up to Humboldt to do their road show, and there were less than
[00:47.280 --> 00:49.000]  35 people in the audience.
[00:49.000 --> 00:50.320]  There was nobody that showed up.
[00:50.320 --> 00:51.320]  No one.
[00:51.320 --> 00:53.200]  There were more people from the state than there were there.
[00:53.200 --> 00:55.760]  And I explained to them, that's because they've given up.
[00:55.760 --> 00:56.760]  There's no hope.
[00:56.960 --> 00:59.200]  Justin talked about a grieving going on.
[00:59.200 --> 01:01.920]  Swami talks about a thousand cuts.
[01:01.920 --> 01:05.800]  You basically have people that, it's a perfect storm, where it wasn't just the taxes, it
[01:05.800 --> 01:10.520]  is the taxes, but it's the land use, you've got the cultivators that have to now apply
[01:10.520 --> 01:14.240]  to building codes, you've got them having to deal with water boards.
[01:14.240 --> 01:18.680]  Up north, you could get away with doing whatever you wanted for a long time, because the water
[01:18.680 --> 01:20.200]  boards and fish and game weren't in.
[01:20.200 --> 01:23.680]  Now that they're in, it's like they used to fly helicopters, and then you had to go get
[01:23.680 --> 01:26.840]  a warrant, prove that you could go in there, and they go to a lot of trouble with cops.
[01:26.840 --> 01:31.000]  Now you just fly over with Google Map, you see it on a computer, you send the $10,000
[01:31.000 --> 01:35.080]  to $20,000 a day fine, tell them they've got to shut down, and they have to.
[01:35.080 --> 01:40.040]  So they're sending out hundreds of notices throughout Humboldt, and Trinity, and Mendocino,
[01:40.040 --> 01:41.720]  they're shutting down the markets.
[01:41.720 --> 01:46.000]  The people that have been here for 40, 50, 60 years doing this, if you looked at the
[01:46.000 --> 01:49.760]  size of Mendocino and Humboldt, Trinity, and Emerald Triangle, it's larger than most of
[01:49.760 --> 01:51.080]  the small states in this country.
[01:51.400 --> 01:54.440]  If this was, like they said, if this was a coal issue with coal farmers, or if this was
[01:54.440 --> 01:58.840]  a farm issue in Kansas, there's more farmers being wiped out in Emerald Triangle than there
[01:58.840 --> 02:02.560]  are in Kansas or any place where they're subsidizing farm labor.
[02:02.560 --> 02:05.480]  Are those farmers having trouble even getting through the licensing process?
[02:05.480 --> 02:07.480]  Are they getting licensed locally at the state?
[02:07.480 --> 02:12.800]  Well, if you're talking about that, you've got less than 300 licensed farms in Mendocino,
[02:12.800 --> 02:15.200]  less than 400 in Humboldt.
[02:15.200 --> 02:18.880]  They're having a very challenging time because of, you know, Ed Rosenthal said it, we argued
[02:18.880 --> 02:20.480]  years ago, and it's true.
[02:20.600 --> 02:23.720]  Humboldt, Mendocino, they weren't made for traditional farming.
[02:23.720 --> 02:26.560]  The land's steep, there's no soil, lack of water.
[02:26.560 --> 02:30.440]  You know, it's challenging, but then you've got deserts out here that are bringing 500,000
[02:30.440 --> 02:33.880]  square foot farms in, and they're taking the water from the Sierras or wherever else they're
[02:33.880 --> 02:37.440]  taking it from, and they're not in trouble, but the landowners up in Mendocino can't use
[02:37.440 --> 02:38.440]  their own water.
[02:38.440 --> 02:41.960]  So between the building codes, the taxes, everything, you're basically going to look
[02:41.960 --> 02:45.440]  at 75% of the people that built this industry are going to be gone.
[02:45.440 --> 02:49.720]  And in addition to that, you've got the microbusinesses, and they're not letting people do home microbusinesses
[02:49.760 --> 02:50.760]  for the most part.
[02:50.760 --> 02:53.480]  So the product makers, the small people that did all that are gone too.
[02:53.480 --> 02:55.360]  So I'm excited about 64.
[02:55.360 --> 02:56.360]  I voted for it.
[02:56.360 --> 02:57.360]  I'm with Fiona and everything else.
[02:57.360 --> 02:58.680]  I know we're going to be in a great world.
[02:58.680 --> 03:01.560]  The consumers are going to get the best products they could ever hope for.
[03:01.560 --> 03:03.680]  We're going to have, you know, cost-effective medicine.
[03:03.680 --> 03:04.680]  People are going to jail.
[03:04.680 --> 03:07.400]  I'm a huge advocate for all the people rotting away in jails across this country.
[03:07.400 --> 03:09.320]  And so I don't want to say it's negative.
[03:09.320 --> 03:11.120]  It's a great thing we're going into.
[03:11.120 --> 03:14.960]  But he asked about what we're seeing for the small farmers and small product makers, and
[03:14.960 --> 03:17.440]  it is an extinction event that they're going through right now.
