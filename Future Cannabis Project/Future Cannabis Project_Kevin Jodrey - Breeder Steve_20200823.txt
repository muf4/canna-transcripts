[00:00.000 --> 00:05.760]  Make the connection.
[00:05.760 --> 00:18.660]  And all right.
[00:18.660 --> 00:19.820]  Welcome, everyone.
[00:19.820 --> 00:21.820]  We are live on YouTube.
[00:21.820 --> 00:25.620]  We're talking actually to a few people.
[00:25.620 --> 00:26.900]  We have some new additions.
[00:26.900 --> 00:29.860]  But it was starting with Breeder Steve and Kevin Jodry.
[00:29.860 --> 00:38.300]  So I had my border crossing Canada meets USA.
[00:38.300 --> 00:42.940]  So anyway, and so with us right now is Ryan Douglas.
[00:42.940 --> 00:50.820]  And both of you, Steve and Ryan, have been growing and spending
[00:50.820 --> 00:52.020]  a lot of time in Columbia.
[00:52.020 --> 00:54.660]  So Steve, you were just about to ask Ryan a question.
[00:54.660 --> 00:56.620]  And I said, hold that question for one second.
[00:56.620 --> 00:58.660]  So what was the question?
[00:58.660 --> 01:00.620]  Well, the reason that he'd chosen,
[01:00.620 --> 01:05.660]  I was wondering what made him choose that area.
[01:05.660 --> 01:06.160]  Sure.
[01:06.160 --> 01:10.640]  So my background is actually as a commercial greenhouse
[01:10.640 --> 01:11.200]  cultivator.
[01:11.200 --> 01:15.000]  So even before touching cannabis commercially, for 15 years,
[01:15.000 --> 01:16.920]  I was growing ornamental and edible crops
[01:16.920 --> 01:19.160]  in commercial greenhouses in the US.
[01:19.160 --> 01:21.160]  And every single work crew I ever managed
[01:21.160 --> 01:22.920]  was Spanish speaking.
[01:22.920 --> 01:26.440]  So 10 years ago, I took a year off to teach myself Spanish.
[01:26.440 --> 01:28.920]  And I just by random choice picked Columbia.
[01:28.920 --> 01:32.000]  And even by more random choice picked Manizales.
[01:32.000 --> 01:33.920]  So I had learned Spanish.
[01:33.920 --> 01:35.400]  But 10 years later, when I decided
[01:35.440 --> 01:38.200]  to branch out on my own as an independent cultivation
[01:38.200 --> 01:40.880]  consultant, I went back there.
[01:44.760 --> 01:47.840]  So I spent the last four years living and growing
[01:47.840 --> 01:51.160]  and consulting on cannabis projects in Columbia.
[01:51.160 --> 01:54.560]  And so I've been in some of the cooler regions
[01:54.560 --> 01:56.720]  and some rainy regions and some of the hottest
[01:56.720 --> 01:57.640]  regions in Columbia.
[01:57.640 --> 02:00.520]  So just before we went on air, you
[02:00.520 --> 02:03.480]  asked me how do I like growing in Manizales.
[02:03.520 --> 02:05.880]  So growing inside my apartment, it's
[02:05.880 --> 02:08.520]  great because the temperature is perfect
[02:08.520 --> 02:09.920]  and it gets plenty of sunlight.
[02:09.920 --> 02:14.720]  But Manizales, as you know, in Columbia,
[02:14.720 --> 02:18.440]  growing conditions are dictated oftentimes by elevation.
[02:18.440 --> 02:23.160]  And so where Manizales is, it's about 2,000 meters
[02:23.160 --> 02:26.720]  above sea level, which means it can get cold at night
[02:26.720 --> 02:28.520]  and it can tend to be cloudy and rainy.
[02:28.520 --> 02:31.240]  So we all know that's bad for cannabis.
[02:31.240 --> 02:33.400]  So indoors, it's fine.
[02:33.400 --> 02:36.640]  Outdoors, there's really not much cannabis cultivation
[02:36.640 --> 02:38.360]  just for exactly that reason.
[02:38.360 --> 02:42.080]  So any growing I've done and all the clients I've worked with
[02:42.080 --> 02:47.160]  are in regions below that number.
[02:47.160 --> 02:49.000]  But it's a manageable temperature
[02:49.000 --> 02:52.440]  for indoor operations, I guess.
[02:52.440 --> 02:54.560]  For indoor, you mean completely indoor?
[02:54.560 --> 02:58.960]  Well, or closed, let's say, enclosed operations.
[02:58.960 --> 03:02.320]  If it's really hot, greenhouses are, it's like, oh, no,
[03:02.320 --> 03:04.280]  they're trying to cool this huge place.
[03:04.280 --> 03:07.480]  You'd like to find somewhere a little cooler for it.
[03:07.480 --> 03:07.960]  Yep.
[03:07.960 --> 03:10.680]  Yeah, so in Manizales, the trick is really the night.
[03:10.680 --> 03:13.080]  You'd have to actually heat the greenhouse
[03:13.080 --> 03:14.960]  to have a healthy crop.
[03:14.960 --> 03:17.240]  So it just makes sense just to drive down the mountain
[03:17.240 --> 03:20.120]  a little bit where temperatures are really in the ideal range
[03:20.120 --> 03:21.920]  for growing cannabis.
[03:21.920 --> 03:24.920]  And you have the traditional land range there,
[03:24.920 --> 03:26.040]  Manizales Black.
[03:28.880 --> 03:30.040]  You ever see it?
[03:30.040 --> 03:31.280]  No.
[03:31.280 --> 03:31.920]  OK.
[03:31.920 --> 03:36.120]  That's a famous old Colombian one for sure.
[03:36.120 --> 03:38.000]  Oh, no, I never heard of that, actually.
[03:38.000 --> 03:39.600]  I'd love to look into that.
[03:39.600 --> 03:40.960]  Yeah, Manizales Negro.
[03:40.960 --> 03:43.600]  Yeah.
[03:43.600 --> 03:46.920]  And we got Kevin, have you grown, or Steve,
[03:46.920 --> 03:52.120]  just tell Kevin the cultivar you were just talking about.
[03:52.120 --> 03:54.400]  Manizales Negro, or Manizales Black.
[03:57.200 --> 03:59.360]  What was the name of it again, Steve?
[03:59.400 --> 04:02.400]  Manizales Black.
[04:02.400 --> 04:04.320]  No, not specifically.
[04:04.320 --> 04:07.840]  If you look back, like when you think of Punta Rojo,
[04:07.840 --> 04:11.560]  or Mango Beach, or Limon Verde, and Santa Marta Gold,
[04:11.560 --> 04:16.000]  the other big one was Manizales Black.
[04:16.000 --> 04:19.440]  Really black, black plant.
[04:19.440 --> 04:20.280]  Interesting.
[04:20.280 --> 04:21.400]  The coloration was black.
[04:21.400 --> 04:24.840]  Skinny little, skinny little buds, Manizales Black.
[04:24.840 --> 04:26.880]  What was the highlight?
[04:26.880 --> 04:27.760]  I didn't have it.
[04:27.760 --> 04:30.160]  I've only seen it in pictures.
[04:30.160 --> 04:31.200]  Gotcha.
[04:31.200 --> 04:32.360]  Yeah.
[04:32.360 --> 04:35.880]  But I have to try some for sure, because I've
[04:35.880 --> 04:40.200]  seen more and more of these lesser known Colombian ones
[04:40.200 --> 04:42.520]  that I haven't tried yet that I've heard of.
[04:42.520 --> 04:44.520]  And even that one I'd heard of a long time ago,
[04:44.520 --> 04:47.880]  but never ever came across it.
[04:47.880 --> 04:48.520]  Oh, totally.
[04:48.520 --> 04:50.720]  I've seen it in pictures even on Instagram and stuff.
[04:50.720 --> 04:55.520]  So there's people that have it, but it's rare.
[04:55.520 --> 04:57.360]  I can't say anything about it.
[04:57.800 --> 04:59.600]  I haven't even tried it myself.
[04:59.600 --> 05:01.680]  Yeah, no, I got to go back over to,
[05:01.680 --> 05:04.120]  I got some friends in Cali.
[05:04.120 --> 05:06.560]  And there's a cluster of guys there
[05:06.560 --> 05:08.440]  that are older that have been really preserving
[05:08.440 --> 05:11.040]  some lines for time.
[05:11.040 --> 05:13.760]  And when I get some free time after the season,
[05:13.760 --> 05:16.280]  I'd love to go over to Columbia again so I can kind of hang out
[05:16.280 --> 05:17.000]  in that area.
[05:17.000 --> 05:19.280]  And then I can take a look at all the different stuff
[05:19.280 --> 05:20.720]  that they've worked with for years,
[05:20.720 --> 05:24.800]  just because our access to those things
[05:24.800 --> 05:28.480]  ended so long ago that a lot of the stuff is memory to me.
[05:28.480 --> 05:31.480]  And then from what I see when I travel over to Columbia now,
[05:31.480 --> 05:35.760]  but we just, the US just drug ward,
[05:35.760 --> 05:37.520]  most of that stuff right out of existence.
[05:37.520 --> 05:40.120]  Yeah, it's very sad.
[05:40.120 --> 05:41.880]  Very sad.
[05:41.880 --> 05:47.160]  So Kevin, what's the plant in the background on your TV?
[05:47.160 --> 05:50.520]  This one is just a little bonsai plant.
[05:50.520 --> 05:51.240]  I thought so.
[05:51.240 --> 05:52.880]  I was like, that thing's hysterical looking.
[05:52.880 --> 05:54.320]  Yeah, yeah, that's right.
[05:55.800 --> 05:59.480]  I just, you know what I do is these cheater bonsais is that
[05:59.480 --> 06:03.320]  I did some light that plants because we're doing the pandemic
[06:03.320 --> 06:06.800]  at home and I've got the plants around the pool.
[06:06.800 --> 06:10.240]  So I had enough space in the pool shed to do light up
[06:10.240 --> 06:11.400]  with four of them.
[06:11.400 --> 06:15.280]  So I would stick them in and do light up every 7.30 a.m.
[06:15.280 --> 06:18.600]  and p.m. all summer just for something to do.
[06:18.600 --> 06:22.120]  And at the end, I took them out, trimmed them down
[06:22.120 --> 06:26.520]  into bonsai pots and just had some fun with the stumps of them.
[06:26.520 --> 06:29.840]  And I've actually been giving them away to friends.
[06:29.840 --> 06:32.160]  The rare friend that comes for a visit and likes them,
[06:32.160 --> 06:34.360]  I'm like, here, this one's yours.
[06:34.360 --> 06:36.000]  Oh, that's great.
[06:36.000 --> 06:37.520]  Just for joy, you know.
[06:37.520 --> 06:38.000]  Yeah, yeah.
[06:38.000 --> 06:39.400]  A little flowered plant to bring home.
[06:39.400 --> 06:40.840]  Freshens up the living room, you know.
[06:47.040 --> 06:51.120]  People have to enjoy cannabis from a decorative perspective, too.
[06:51.640 --> 06:53.640]  They should have it in public gardens.
[06:53.640 --> 06:55.920]  It drives me nuts to the business.
[06:55.920 --> 06:57.520]  You have four plants in Canada.
[06:57.520 --> 07:00.080]  If your neighbors can see them instantly, they're illegal.
[07:00.080 --> 07:01.360]  Like, what the fuck is that?
[07:01.360 --> 07:03.640]  They're legal or they're not, you know?
[07:04.240 --> 07:07.920]  Yeah, see, we have it where the neighbors can see it,
[07:08.280 --> 07:12.240]  but there has to be a specific distance set back from their property line
[07:12.800 --> 07:17.360]  based off of how much acreage your home site is and theirs.
[07:18.160 --> 07:21.720]  So it's fucking nuts.
[07:22.680 --> 07:24.640]  And it's tedious, man.
[07:26.440 --> 07:30.520]  It's impossible for people to really enjoy cannabis on a four plant max.
[07:31.760 --> 07:35.160]  You can't you can't you can't hold anything in your library for preservation
[07:35.160 --> 07:38.720]  because you only have what you call three plants and you can flower one a year.
[07:39.040 --> 07:42.320]  You got to grow a 26 pound plant.
[07:42.320 --> 07:44.400]  Not up here, especially.
[07:44.920 --> 07:46.920]  Where are you located?
[07:46.920 --> 07:48.920]  I'm in British Columbia right now.
[07:48.920 --> 07:50.920]  BC.
[07:50.920 --> 07:52.920]  Yeah.
[07:52.920 --> 07:54.920]  What's that mean?
[07:54.920 --> 07:56.920]  How far inland?
[07:56.920 --> 07:58.920]  Four hours from the coast.
[07:58.920 --> 08:00.920]  Ooh.
[08:00.920 --> 08:02.920]  Drive.
[08:02.920 --> 08:04.920]  That's a good drive.
[08:04.920 --> 08:06.920]  British Columbia goes deeper.
[08:06.920 --> 08:08.920]  I have to go take a look at a map.
[08:08.920 --> 08:10.920]  It goes deeper than I thought.
[08:10.920 --> 08:12.920]  Four hour drive.
[08:13.440 --> 08:16.640]  Well, just quickly, speaking of maps,
[08:16.640 --> 08:18.640]  hold on, I just lost it.
[08:18.640 --> 08:22.640]  I had pulled up
[08:22.640 --> 08:24.640]  there we go,
[08:24.640 --> 08:26.640]  Manizales, so people can see where it is.
[08:26.640 --> 08:28.640]  So Medellin
[08:28.640 --> 08:30.640]  and then it's just it's about
[08:30.640 --> 08:33.640]  how many hours between Medellin and Bogota.
[08:35.640 --> 08:37.640]  Yep. So hi, Kevin.
[08:37.640 --> 08:39.640]  My name is Ryan Douglas.
[08:39.640 --> 08:41.640]  We've never met.
[08:42.360 --> 08:44.360]  I'm a cultivation consultant,
[08:44.360 --> 08:46.360]  but I've spent the last four years
[08:46.360 --> 08:48.360]  living and consulting in Colombia.
[08:48.360 --> 08:50.360]  So Peter yesterday, last night
[08:50.360 --> 08:52.360]  invited me on and I've heard you
[08:52.360 --> 08:54.360]  speak a lot.
[08:54.360 --> 08:56.360]  I've seen some of your recordings
[08:56.360 --> 08:58.360]  and it's a pleasure to meet you.
[08:58.360 --> 09:00.360]  You too, man.
[09:00.360 --> 09:02.360]  It's so interesting because
[09:02.360 --> 09:04.360]  living in Colombia for four years,
[09:04.360 --> 09:06.360]  you've seen some crazy changes.
[09:06.360 --> 09:08.360]  Yeah. I mean, I love it.
[09:08.360 --> 09:10.360]  It's a great place to be.
[09:11.080 --> 09:13.080]  You take advantage of
[09:13.080 --> 09:15.080]  a humanitarian flight organized
[09:15.080 --> 09:17.080]  by the U.S. Embassy
[09:17.080 --> 09:19.080]  because in Colombia, once COVID hit,
[09:19.080 --> 09:21.080]  they closed the international airport.
[09:21.080 --> 09:23.080]  They closed all airports from April through September.
[09:23.080 --> 09:25.080]  Yeah, they locked it down
[09:25.080 --> 09:27.080]  because the guys that I was talking to
[09:27.080 --> 09:29.080]  that were running the projects
[09:29.080 --> 09:31.080]  over in Vichada next to
[09:31.080 --> 09:33.080]  the Venezuela border
[09:33.080 --> 09:35.080]  and then there was another operation
[09:35.080 --> 09:37.080]  about six hours from Bogota.
[09:37.080 --> 09:39.080]  Both of those guys are Canadian nationals originally,
[09:39.800 --> 09:41.800]  but they've been in Colombia for a long time
[09:41.800 --> 09:43.800]  and we were talking and they said,
[09:43.800 --> 09:45.800]  man, we're about to get locked into the country
[09:45.800 --> 09:47.800]  and they were kind of scared
[09:47.800 --> 09:49.800]  and it's funny because they're not scared kind of guys.
[09:49.800 --> 09:51.800]  They were just like, Colombia's not prepared
[09:51.800 --> 09:53.800]  to lock the country down in this form.
[09:53.800 --> 09:55.800]  They don't have the support system.
[09:55.800 --> 09:57.800]  And I see that with a lot of places
[09:57.800 --> 09:59.800]  where the government shuts down
[09:59.800 --> 10:01.800]  the borders and controls the thing
[10:01.800 --> 10:03.800]  but they don't support the people
[10:03.800 --> 10:05.800]  in the survival process.
[10:05.800 --> 10:07.800]  And so you kind of leave everyone
[10:08.520 --> 10:10.520]  to their own
[10:10.520 --> 10:12.520]  and it's just strange times.
[10:12.520 --> 10:14.520]  It's tricky.
[10:14.520 --> 10:16.520]  And the lockdown is pretty intense.
[10:16.520 --> 10:18.520]  You had one day a week where you could leave
[10:18.520 --> 10:20.520]  and that was dependent
[10:20.520 --> 10:22.520]  on the last digit of your identification card.
[10:22.520 --> 10:24.520]  So one day a week
[10:24.520 --> 10:26.520]  you could leave to go to the pharmacy,
[10:26.520 --> 10:28.520]  the bank, the grocery store.
[10:28.520 --> 10:30.520]  So I had a Colombian ID and I had my US passport
[10:30.520 --> 10:32.520]  so at least I could leave two days a week
[10:32.520 --> 10:34.520]  but it's pretty strictly enforced
[10:34.520 --> 10:36.520]  and they even said I think
[10:37.240 --> 10:39.240]  anyone over 70 years old just could not leave the house.
[10:39.240 --> 10:41.240]  So you have a lot of elderly folks
[10:41.240 --> 10:43.240]  that live in the country without permission to leave
[10:43.240 --> 10:45.240]  and they literally have no way to get any food.
[10:45.240 --> 10:47.240]  So just to what you're saying,
[10:47.240 --> 10:49.240]  they implement the law
[10:49.240 --> 10:51.240]  but then they don't support
[10:51.240 --> 10:53.240]  the people to abide by it.
[10:53.240 --> 10:55.240]  But about a month ago
[10:55.240 --> 10:57.240]  I snuck out on a humanitarian flight
[10:57.240 --> 10:59.240]  so I finished up
[10:59.240 --> 11:01.240]  with the final consulting project
[11:01.240 --> 11:03.240]  I had just outside of Cali
[11:03.240 --> 11:05.240]  with one of my clients
[11:05.960 --> 11:07.960]  so I've been in Maine ever since.
[11:07.960 --> 11:09.960]  But hopefully...
[11:09.960 --> 11:11.960]  I'm from Maine originally
[11:11.960 --> 11:13.960]  and I usually spend the summers here.
[11:13.960 --> 11:15.960]  So I'm here now.
[11:15.960 --> 11:17.960]  Where's your family from?
[11:17.960 --> 11:19.960]  Up in Brooklyn?
[11:19.960 --> 11:21.960]  Yeah, up heading towards Canada area.
[11:21.960 --> 11:23.960]  You know, right across from
[11:23.960 --> 11:25.960]  the coastal
[11:25.960 --> 11:27.960]  but up on the top of Maine.
[11:27.960 --> 11:29.960]  What's the name of the town did you say?
[11:29.960 --> 11:31.960]  Brooklyn.
[11:31.960 --> 11:33.960]  Oh wow.
[11:34.680 --> 11:36.680]  We still have the same homes and stuff.
[11:36.680 --> 11:38.680]  I lived in Rhode Island and my family had settled there
[11:38.680 --> 11:40.680]  but we used to go up to Maine and visit
[11:40.680 --> 11:42.680]  and we were sea traders.
[11:42.680 --> 11:44.680]  And so all the old stone piers
[11:44.680 --> 11:46.680]  going out to sea was still there
[11:46.680 --> 11:48.680]  and the homes and they had just been
[11:48.680 --> 11:50.680]  passed on for hundreds of years.
[11:50.680 --> 11:52.680]  And Maine's gorgeous.
[11:52.680 --> 11:54.680]  And I think about moving back sometimes
[11:54.680 --> 11:56.680]  because I just love the coast.
[11:56.680 --> 11:58.680]  And then it's just tough though
[11:58.680 --> 12:00.680]  because Humboldt County just really grabbed me.
[12:00.680 --> 12:02.680]  Yeah.
[12:03.400 --> 12:05.400]  I can't give it up
[12:05.400 --> 12:07.400]  but I go out at night and I zillow down
[12:07.400 --> 12:09.400]  and I look at all the real estate
[12:09.400 --> 12:11.400]  on the coast of Maine and Maryland
[12:11.400 --> 12:13.400]  and I'm like, oh I'd be happy right there.
[12:13.400 --> 12:15.400]  Outstanding.
[12:15.400 --> 12:17.400]  No, it's beautiful in the summer but I think
[12:17.400 --> 12:19.400]  Humboldt County probably has better weather
[12:19.400 --> 12:21.400]  the rest of the year.
[12:21.400 --> 12:23.400]  Yeah, Humboldt's nice and you know
[12:23.400 --> 12:25.400]  the thing with Humboldt is that
[12:25.400 --> 12:27.400]  even with the fires right now
[12:27.400 --> 12:29.400]  the way the heat wave worked
[12:29.400 --> 12:31.400]  the offshore push
[12:32.120 --> 12:34.120]  under us and then over us and then down
[12:34.120 --> 12:36.120]  and so Humboldt didn't get the same
[12:36.120 --> 12:38.120]  intensity
[12:38.120 --> 12:40.120]  that we
[12:40.120 --> 12:42.120]  should have received compared to the rest of the valley
[12:42.120 --> 12:44.120]  that's burned into down.
[12:44.120 --> 12:46.120]  And ironically it's like
[12:46.120 --> 12:48.120]  a miracle because we received that same
[12:48.120 --> 12:50.120]  situation this winter and it shunted
[12:50.120 --> 12:52.120]  all the rain away from us.
[12:52.120 --> 12:54.120]  So we had a really, really dry year up here
[12:54.120 --> 12:56.120]  which is terrifying for fires
[12:56.120 --> 12:58.120]  because I mean if you've been in one you just like
[12:58.120 --> 13:00.120]  it changes
[13:00.840 --> 13:02.840]  your whole perception on you're trapped.
[13:02.840 --> 13:04.840]  And it didn't give us any water
[13:04.840 --> 13:06.840]  at all and it moved the water north
[13:06.840 --> 13:08.840]  heading towards Oregon
[13:08.840 --> 13:10.840]  and it moved the water south down
[13:10.840 --> 13:12.840]  into Southern California
[13:12.840 --> 13:14.840]  and we didn't get any.
[13:14.840 --> 13:16.840]  And now that same weird weather pattern
[13:16.840 --> 13:18.840]  is moving the heat away
[13:18.840 --> 13:20.840]  from us and so I mean I'm grateful
[13:20.840 --> 13:22.840]  because this place had just burned to the ground.
[13:24.840 --> 13:26.840]  But Humboldt's gorgeous. Once you're here
[13:26.840 --> 13:28.840]  and you can experience it
[13:29.560 --> 13:31.560]  you're just like wow.
[13:31.560 --> 13:33.560]  It's just like Columbia though.
[13:33.560 --> 13:35.560]  When you're in Columbia you're just overwhelmed.
[13:37.560 --> 13:39.560]  It's funny because you Zillow places
[13:39.560 --> 13:41.560]  in Maine and I Zillow places in Rhode Island
[13:41.560 --> 13:43.560]  where I'm like 60 acres
[13:43.560 --> 13:45.560]  for $300,000
[13:45.560 --> 13:47.560]  because my parents are in Arganza right now
[13:47.560 --> 13:49.560]  and my brother
[13:49.560 --> 13:51.560]  just got a place in Hope Valley
[13:51.560 --> 13:53.560]  which is like 20-30
[13:53.560 --> 13:55.560]  minutes inland on a lake.
[13:55.560 --> 13:57.560]  Oh nice.
[13:58.280 --> 14:00.280]  Rhode Island's a good place to live too.
[14:00.280 --> 14:02.280]  It's got a really nice
[14:02.280 --> 14:04.280]  the way the freeways move through it
[14:04.280 --> 14:06.280]  everything's pretty close to movement
[14:06.280 --> 14:08.280]  and the bay
[14:08.280 --> 14:10.280]  carves up the whole middle of the state
[14:10.280 --> 14:12.280]  so you have this really
[14:12.280 --> 14:14.280]  interesting ocean type life
[14:14.280 --> 14:16.280]  but it's the same thing
[14:16.280 --> 14:18.280]  I left Rhode Island
[14:18.280 --> 14:20.280]  and now that cannabis
[14:20.280 --> 14:22.280]  is all normalized there people always ask
[14:22.280 --> 14:24.280]  am I going to move back but I'm like man
[14:24.280 --> 14:26.280]  I built a whole life here in Humboldt
[14:27.000 --> 14:29.000]  and so this is my home
[14:29.000 --> 14:31.000]  but I'm in New England
[14:31.000 --> 14:33.000]  down deep and
[14:33.000 --> 14:35.000]  on the surface still too
[14:35.000 --> 14:38.340]  so I think about it.
[14:42.340 --> 14:44.340]  So Sjoerd was going to join us
[14:44.340 --> 14:46.340]  but he's actually dealing with the fires
[14:46.340 --> 14:48.340]  so he can't make it today
[14:48.340 --> 14:50.340]  but he said
[14:50.340 --> 14:52.340]  sometime in the future.
[14:52.340 --> 14:54.340]  Smash in Sonoma.
[14:54.340 --> 14:56.340]  Well in Salinas too.
[14:57.060 --> 14:59.060]  Santa Cruz
[14:59.060 --> 15:01.060]  I can't keep track
[15:01.060 --> 15:03.060]  there's too many of them
[15:03.060 --> 15:05.060]  we're supposed to get another series of them this weekend
[15:05.060 --> 15:07.060]  we're supposed to have another lightning storm
[15:07.060 --> 15:09.060]  the lightning storm came in and lit up like 200 fires
[15:09.060 --> 15:11.060]  so dry lightning
[15:11.060 --> 15:13.060]  no rain just lightning
[15:13.060 --> 15:15.060]  and we're supposed to get another one of those storms
[15:15.060 --> 15:17.060]  I think like Sunday up here
[15:17.060 --> 15:19.060]  and so
[15:19.060 --> 15:21.060]  all the reports are out
[15:21.060 --> 15:23.060]  but there's nothing you can do
[15:23.060 --> 15:25.060]  you can't escape this shit
[15:25.780 --> 15:27.780]  it's dry with wind like this
[15:27.780 --> 15:29.780]  it moves like crazy
[15:29.780 --> 15:31.780]  and anyone that's in that central strip
[15:31.780 --> 15:33.780]  they're just getting decimated
[15:33.780 --> 15:35.780]  Lake County
[15:35.780 --> 15:37.780]  Lake County's had over
[15:37.780 --> 15:39.780]  50-55% of the entire county
[15:39.780 --> 15:41.780]  has burned over the last 6 years
[15:41.780 --> 15:43.780]  and Lake County's beautiful
[15:43.780 --> 15:45.780]  but when your odds of having everything
[15:45.780 --> 15:47.780]  burned to the ground
[15:47.780 --> 15:51.630]  are at that level
[15:51.630 --> 15:53.630]  you can't live there
[15:53.630 --> 15:55.630]  not safely.
[15:56.350 --> 15:58.350]  What's your frosty beverage of choice right now?
[16:00.350 --> 16:02.350]  I'm having an IPA from
[16:02.350 --> 16:04.350]  a little BC brewery
[16:04.350 --> 16:06.350]  called Kind Brewing
[16:06.350 --> 16:08.350]  What's it called?
[16:08.350 --> 16:10.350]  It's an IPA
[16:10.350 --> 16:12.350]  he was calling Kind of Hoppy
[16:12.350 --> 16:14.350]  I don't think it even has a real name
[16:14.350 --> 16:16.350]  but it's an India Pale Ale
[16:16.350 --> 16:18.350]  it's quite
[16:18.350 --> 16:20.350]  hoppy
[16:20.350 --> 16:22.350]  It looks hoppy
[16:22.350 --> 16:24.350]  it's got a head on it
[16:25.070 --> 16:27.070]  It's not a drop in that bowl
[16:27.070 --> 16:29.070]  It's gone down a little
[16:29.070 --> 16:31.070]  I've been drinking it down slowly
[16:31.070 --> 16:33.070]  I think I've got to top it up again
[16:33.070 --> 16:35.070]  before too long
[16:35.070 --> 16:37.070]  it is Saturday I think
[16:37.070 --> 16:39.070]  and that seems like a good reason
[16:39.070 --> 16:41.070]  to send you
[16:43.070 --> 16:45.070]  No time, it's Saturday summer in the world
[16:45.070 --> 16:47.070]  Right
[16:47.070 --> 16:49.070]  It's Sunday
[16:49.070 --> 16:51.070]  I was going to say in Australia
[16:51.070 --> 16:53.070]  but maybe it's almost Sunday
[16:53.790 --> 16:55.790]  It's probably Sunday morning
[16:57.790 --> 16:59.790]  Do we have anyone tuning in from Australia right now?
[16:59.790 --> 17:01.790]  I know we probably have South Africa
[17:01.790 --> 17:03.790]  One of the
[17:03.790 --> 17:05.790]  initial things
[17:07.790 --> 17:09.790]  Kevin, you've been in
[17:09.790 --> 17:11.790]  Columbia for the past four years
[17:11.790 --> 17:13.790]  Steve, you've spent time there
[17:13.790 --> 17:15.790]  Can you talk about
[17:15.790 --> 17:17.790]  some stuff that you have experienced
[17:17.790 --> 17:19.790]  growing in the northern hemisphere
[17:19.790 --> 17:21.790]  that you planted down there
[17:22.510 --> 17:24.510]  and how it expresses itself
[17:24.510 --> 17:26.510]  either surprisingly, similarly
[17:26.510 --> 17:28.510]  or totally differently
[17:28.510 --> 17:30.510]  For me the biggest surprise
[17:30.510 --> 17:32.510]  was everything
[17:32.510 --> 17:34.510]  was finishing a lot faster
[17:34.510 --> 17:36.510]  than it would inside
[17:36.510 --> 17:38.510]  I've been growing
[17:38.510 --> 17:40.510]  and it is actually still
[17:40.510 --> 17:42.510]  northern hemisphere but it's about
[17:42.510 --> 17:44.510]  3.5 degrees north
[17:44.510 --> 17:46.510]  so it's pretty darn close to the equator
[17:46.510 --> 17:48.510]  I think we have about 6 minutes
[17:48.510 --> 17:50.510]  variation in the year off
[17:51.230 --> 17:53.230]  It's very little
[17:53.230 --> 17:55.230]  but things that you might think
[17:55.230 --> 17:57.230]  would take 8 weeks inside
[17:57.230 --> 17:59.230]  are literally coming down
[17:59.230 --> 18:01.230]  6 or 7
[18:01.230 --> 18:03.230]  ridiculously fast stuff finishes
[18:03.230 --> 18:05.230]  So I just say generally speaking
[18:05.230 --> 18:07.230]  take a week off stuff
[18:07.230 --> 18:09.230]  and often it's even 2
[18:09.230 --> 18:11.230]  It's really shocking
[18:11.230 --> 18:13.230]  but I think it's just
[18:13.230 --> 18:15.230]  the intensity of the conditions
[18:15.230 --> 18:17.230]  like the light is really hard
[18:17.230 --> 18:19.230]  you feel it like a weight on you
[18:19.950 --> 18:21.950]  The flowers I've had finish there
[18:21.950 --> 18:23.950]  were some really good ones
[18:23.950 --> 18:25.950]  and I just do field grown
[18:25.950 --> 18:27.950]  like it's straight organic
[18:27.950 --> 18:29.950]  in the field
[18:29.950 --> 18:31.950]  and there's no roof over it
[18:31.950 --> 18:33.950]  keeping the rain off
[18:33.950 --> 18:35.950]  and they're finishing rock hard
[18:35.950 --> 18:37.950]  stunning tight buds if that's their type
[18:37.950 --> 18:39.950]  you know if they're
[18:39.950 --> 18:41.950]  fingery long flowered
[18:41.950 --> 18:43.950]  things that's what they'll look like
[18:43.950 --> 18:45.950]  but they really exhibit what they're supposed
[18:45.950 --> 18:47.950]  to look like and the difference
[18:48.670 --> 18:50.670]  between the rainy season and the dry season
[18:50.670 --> 18:52.670]  in the dry season you can finish
[18:52.670 --> 18:54.670]  anything like literally
[18:54.670 --> 18:56.670]  anything and in the rainy
[18:56.670 --> 18:58.670]  season I found 80%
[18:58.670 --> 19:00.670]  of everything I've tried is finished
[19:00.670 --> 19:02.670]  you know there'd be some
[19:02.670 --> 19:04.670]  that were just not a hope
[19:04.670 --> 19:06.670]  you'd say that's never getting planted down here again
[19:06.670 --> 19:08.670]  or never in the
[19:08.670 --> 19:10.670]  rainy season at least
[19:10.670 --> 19:12.670]  but a surprising number
[19:12.670 --> 19:14.670]  pushed through and were finishing
[19:14.670 --> 19:16.670]  in the rainy season and traditionally
[19:17.390 --> 19:19.390]  in the eastern plains where I've set up
[19:19.390 --> 19:21.390]  is 80%
[19:21.390 --> 19:23.390]  of the annual rainfall in May
[19:23.390 --> 19:25.390]  so pretty good the rest
[19:25.390 --> 19:27.390]  of the year you're not getting
[19:27.390 --> 19:29.390]  it's not like a rain forest
[19:29.390 --> 19:31.390]  where you're constantly getting wet
[19:31.390 --> 19:33.390]  everyday it seems
[19:33.390 --> 19:35.390]  it would definitely be
[19:35.390 --> 19:37.390]  a bigger problem with grass fires
[19:37.390 --> 19:39.390]  in half the year
[19:39.390 --> 19:41.390]  and more than half so we'd get
[19:41.390 --> 19:43.390]  most of the rain May and then some
[19:43.390 --> 19:45.390]  shoulder rain
[19:46.110 --> 19:48.110]  in April or June
[19:48.110 --> 19:50.110]  and then it might dry up a bit in
[19:50.110 --> 19:52.110]  July and then
[19:52.110 --> 19:54.110]  late August, September
[19:54.110 --> 19:56.110]  even the beginning of October
[19:56.110 --> 19:58.110]  they get another kind of mild rainy
[19:58.110 --> 20:00.110]  season we think of it
[20:00.110 --> 20:02.110]  and then the summer
[20:02.110 --> 20:04.110]  starts really November,
[20:04.110 --> 20:06.110]  December
[20:06.110 --> 20:08.110]  that's the summer, November, December,
[20:08.110 --> 20:10.110]  January, February
[20:10.110 --> 20:12.110]  so December is almost
[20:12.110 --> 20:14.110]  unpleasant a lot
[20:14.830 --> 20:16.830]  people go away if they can
[20:16.830 --> 20:18.830]  they'll go to other parts because they just
[20:18.830 --> 20:20.830]  find it too much
[20:20.830 --> 20:22.830]  it's just intense
[20:22.830 --> 20:24.830]  they don't come out until 5 o'clock
[20:24.830 --> 20:26.830]  when the sun's about you get an hour of sunlight
[20:26.830 --> 20:28.830]  and it's not too intense
[20:28.830 --> 20:30.830]  but the rest of the day if they can be out in the sun
[20:30.830 --> 20:32.830]  they will be
[20:32.830 --> 20:34.830]  the field workers can't be there working
[20:34.830 --> 20:36.830]  they're covered up
[20:36.830 --> 20:38.830]  and it's a lot of work
[20:38.830 --> 20:40.830]  and the people I have the utmost respect
[20:40.830 --> 20:42.830]  for the people that work that fine
[20:43.550 --> 20:45.550]  I love going and spending 3-6 weeks
[20:45.550 --> 20:47.550]  at a time when I go down
[20:47.550 --> 20:49.550]  but I haven't been able to go this year
[20:49.550 --> 20:51.550]  so I'm sort of
[20:51.550 --> 20:53.550]  managing the farms through whatsapp
[20:53.550 --> 20:55.550]  and checking videos and pictures
[20:55.550 --> 20:57.550]  but it's great and I've been doing it
[20:57.550 --> 20:59.550]  for years with the same people
[20:59.550 --> 21:01.550]  so everybody's
[21:01.550 --> 21:03.550]  doing what they're doing for a while
[21:03.550 --> 21:05.550]  my day to day input's not that
[21:05.550 --> 21:07.550]  as much needed
[21:07.550 --> 21:09.550]  sometimes it might be they were starting to get
[21:09.550 --> 21:11.550]  this, that or the other
[21:12.270 --> 21:14.270]  what's this bug, let's look it up
[21:14.270 --> 21:16.270]  do we need to do anything
[21:16.270 --> 21:18.270]  so just general
[21:18.270 --> 21:20.270]  general inquiry
[21:20.270 --> 21:22.270]  which is fun just to kind of troubleshoot
[21:22.270 --> 21:24.270]  it like that but I totally
[21:24.270 --> 21:26.270]  miss being there in the fields
[21:26.270 --> 21:28.270]  that's a beautiful
[21:28.270 --> 21:30.270]  place to be if you love fields of grass
[21:30.270 --> 21:32.270]  that's the place you want to be
[21:32.270 --> 21:34.270]  and doing selection perhaps
[21:34.270 --> 21:36.270]  is what really makes it
[21:36.270 --> 21:38.270]  most interesting and once you've been
[21:38.270 --> 21:40.270]  making a few rooms with different
[21:40.990 --> 21:42.990]  new lines to try out
[21:42.990 --> 21:44.990]  new tricks to try out and get things in the ground
[21:44.990 --> 21:46.990]  so I'm watching it all
[21:46.990 --> 21:48.990]  and directing it all but I can't touch
[21:48.990 --> 21:50.990]  or smell it you know
[21:50.990 --> 21:52.990]  I can see it but I can't touch it or smell it
[21:52.990 --> 21:54.990]  it's bizarre that way
[21:54.990 --> 21:56.990]  but it's still
[21:56.990 --> 21:58.990]  great because that's most of the year
[21:58.990 --> 22:00.990]  that's what I was doing before I'd only be down there
[22:00.990 --> 22:02.990]  three to four months a year actually
[22:02.990 --> 22:04.990]  at the farm
[22:04.990 --> 22:06.990]  but this year not being able to go there's just
[22:06.990 --> 22:08.990]  been a bit odd but I know people
[22:09.710 --> 22:11.710]  have bigger problems so I'm not sweating it
[22:19.710 --> 22:21.710]  I was just going to say it's interesting Steve
[22:21.710 --> 22:23.710]  that you mentioned that about the intensity of the light
[22:23.710 --> 22:25.710]  and the crops finishing quicker
[22:25.710 --> 22:27.710]  because in my experience
[22:27.710 --> 22:29.710]  well when people
[22:29.710 --> 22:31.710]  know that I consult in Columbia
[22:31.710 --> 22:33.710]  especially lighting companies they try to get me
[22:33.710 --> 22:35.710]  to refer them to clients down there
[22:35.710 --> 22:37.710]  and so in my opinion I think
[22:38.430 --> 22:40.430]  that's a really tough sell because
[22:40.430 --> 22:42.430]  those 12 hours between 6 in the morning
[22:42.430 --> 22:44.430]  and 6 in the evening
[22:44.430 --> 22:46.430]  the light is so intense
[22:46.430 --> 22:48.430]  that if the grower is taking care
[22:48.430 --> 22:50.430]  of the plants correctly
[22:50.430 --> 22:52.430]  and in terms of temperature they're in the right region
[22:52.430 --> 22:54.430]  the amount of growth that happens
[22:54.430 --> 22:56.430]  in that 12 hours is so explosive
[22:56.430 --> 22:58.430]  that it's really hard to sell a grower
[22:58.430 --> 23:00.430]  on supplemental lighting
[23:00.430 --> 23:02.430]  to light another 6 hours
[23:02.430 --> 23:04.430]  you know to size up the plants
[23:04.430 --> 23:06.430]  I've never ever had indoor
[23:07.150 --> 23:09.150]  I think that's what I finished in the field
[23:09.150 --> 23:11.150]  in the field almost anywhere
[23:11.150 --> 23:13.150]  anywhere 45 degrees latitude
[23:13.150 --> 23:15.150]  or south in a good year
[23:15.150 --> 23:17.150]  you can do dynamite outside
[23:17.150 --> 23:19.150]  you know dynamite
[23:19.150 --> 23:21.150]  and it's really matching the genetics
[23:21.150 --> 23:23.150]  to the site makes all the difference
[23:23.150 --> 23:25.150]  and some sites are just more accepting of more types
[23:25.150 --> 23:27.150]  you know
[23:27.150 --> 23:29.150]  so dry season
[23:29.150 --> 23:31.150]  grasslands down there in the dry season
[23:31.150 --> 23:33.150]  you can just do anything
[23:33.150 --> 23:35.150]  so it'll be fun
[23:35.870 --> 23:37.870]  I'm hoping that you'll be willing to join me
[23:37.870 --> 23:39.870]  the next edition
[23:39.870 --> 23:41.870]  something I've been developing for a while
[23:41.870 --> 23:43.870]  but to have a living library show
[23:43.870 --> 23:45.870]  where we time out
[23:45.870 --> 23:47.870]  everything we've got in the library
[23:47.870 --> 23:49.870]  some stuff takes 9 months to flower
[23:49.870 --> 23:51.870]  on 12-12
[23:51.870 --> 23:53.870]  like real equatorial stuff
[23:53.870 --> 23:55.870]  and we've got other stuff that finishes in 6 weeks
[23:55.870 --> 23:57.870]  when you put a cutting out
[23:57.870 --> 23:59.870]  so we want to time the entire library
[23:59.870 --> 24:01.870]  to finish in the same week
[24:01.870 --> 24:03.870]  let's say the last week of November
[24:04.590 --> 24:06.590]  or the first week of December
[24:06.590 --> 24:08.590]  so you can come over and see
[24:08.590 --> 24:10.590]  all of Asia
[24:10.590 --> 24:12.590]  all of Africa
[24:12.590 --> 24:14.590]  all of North America
[24:14.590 --> 24:16.590]  all these blocks of what's going on
[24:16.590 --> 24:18.590]  including him
[24:18.590 --> 24:20.590]  so it'll be really fun
[24:20.590 --> 24:22.590]  and I'm going to invite anybody
[24:22.590 --> 24:24.590]  that's really into cannabis
[24:24.590 --> 24:26.590]  I want them to come and see it
[24:26.590 --> 24:28.590]  because it's such an effort to put this shit together
[24:28.590 --> 24:30.590]  you want everybody that could possibly
[24:30.590 --> 24:32.590]  that's what I need
[24:33.310 --> 24:35.310]  to come and see that
[24:35.310 --> 24:37.310]  everything alive
[24:37.310 --> 24:39.310]  one week just to go through it all
[24:39.310 --> 24:41.310]  before it's cut
[24:41.310 --> 24:43.310]  I'm really sure
[24:43.310 --> 24:45.310]  we can put it together
[24:45.310 --> 24:47.310]  for next
[24:47.310 --> 24:49.310]  first week of December
[24:49.310 --> 24:51.310]  but this year
[24:51.310 --> 24:53.310]  we're testing more
[24:53.310 --> 24:55.310]  additions to the library
[24:55.310 --> 24:57.310]  let's say that we haven't done
[24:57.310 --> 24:59.310]  the timings on
[24:59.310 --> 25:01.310]  so once we have the timings done
[25:02.030 --> 25:04.030]  we'll be doing it for next year
[25:04.030 --> 25:06.030]  so next year
[25:06.030 --> 25:08.030]  a month before Christmas
[25:08.030 --> 25:10.030]  people wanted to come down and see that
[25:10.030 --> 25:12.030]  I would love to extend the invitation
[25:12.030 --> 25:14.030]  to anybody that tells me
[25:14.030 --> 25:16.030]  that they really need to see it
[25:16.030 --> 25:18.030]  I can understand that
[25:18.030 --> 25:20.030]  I'd love to see them all timed at the same time
[25:20.030 --> 25:22.030]  where you have to sequence your planting
[25:22.030 --> 25:24.030]  like you dial it all in
[25:24.030 --> 25:26.030]  so they all finish
[25:26.030 --> 25:28.030]  terribly the hardest part
[25:28.030 --> 25:30.030]  because otherwise
[25:30.750 --> 25:32.750]  it's just about
[25:32.750 --> 25:34.750]  doing it backwards
[25:34.750 --> 25:36.750]  and timing is everything
[25:36.750 --> 25:38.750]  I think the experience
[25:38.750 --> 25:40.750]  will be live
[25:40.750 --> 25:42.750]  the people that have contributed to this million seed search
[25:42.750 --> 25:44.750]  started a couple years ago
[25:44.750 --> 25:46.750]  and built up this library
[25:46.750 --> 25:48.750]  so it's been a huge hassle
[25:48.750 --> 25:50.750]  to get all the permissions
[25:50.750 --> 25:52.750]  and quotas that we need to plant
[25:52.750 --> 25:54.750]  psychoactive plants
[25:54.750 --> 25:56.750]  so we have to show the R&D
[25:56.750 --> 25:58.750]  we might ask if we want to test
[25:59.470 --> 26:01.470]  and they'll say you can test these 20
[26:01.470 --> 26:03.470]  or they'll start you out with something like that
[26:03.470 --> 26:05.470]  and you're like ahhh
[26:05.470 --> 26:07.470]  so then you go to next year
[26:07.470 --> 26:09.470]  and you apply it
[26:09.470 --> 26:11.470]  and say hey see what I'm doing
[26:11.470 --> 26:13.470]  I need to plant the rest of these
[26:13.470 --> 26:15.470]  so I can get them on known quantities
[26:15.470 --> 26:17.470]  so it's really
[26:17.470 --> 26:19.470]  it's working with one arm tied behind your back
[26:19.470 --> 26:21.470]  it's not like I just got a field and went to work
[26:21.470 --> 26:23.470]  I would have accomplished
[26:23.470 --> 26:25.470]  a hell of a lot by now
[26:25.470 --> 26:27.470]  but it's really been an uphill battle
[26:28.190 --> 26:30.190]  and it's been working
[26:30.190 --> 26:32.190]  in a reluctant back ass ridge regulations
[26:32.190 --> 26:34.190]  which is the world over
[26:34.190 --> 26:36.190]  it's in every country
[26:36.190 --> 26:38.190]  no matter where I go
[26:38.190 --> 26:40.190]  who I speak to
[26:40.190 --> 26:42.190]  we're all constrained by something
[26:42.190 --> 26:44.190]  there's this
[26:44.190 --> 26:46.190]  to get to do it
[26:46.190 --> 26:48.190]  in some level
[26:48.190 --> 26:50.190]  it's like fuck
[26:50.190 --> 26:52.190]  it is worth it
[26:52.190 --> 26:54.190]  just to have it
[26:54.190 --> 26:56.190]  the living library
[26:56.910 --> 26:58.910]  I just have to
[26:58.910 --> 27:00.910]  that's a bucket list
[27:00.910 --> 27:02.910]  basically it's a bucket list item
[27:02.910 --> 27:04.910]  and the only way I could legally do it
[27:04.910 --> 27:06.910]  was getting the license and everything
[27:06.910 --> 27:08.910]  I wanted to keep a living library
[27:08.910 --> 27:10.910]  started every two weeks
[27:10.910 --> 27:12.910]  so that no matter what time of year
[27:12.910 --> 27:14.910]  you visited
[27:14.910 --> 27:16.910]  you could see and get the data
[27:16.910 --> 27:18.910]  I've been finishing in those conditions
[27:18.910 --> 27:20.910]  because the different months are a little different
[27:20.910 --> 27:22.910]  and the
[27:22.910 --> 27:24.910]  if it wasn't to do with quotas
[27:25.630 --> 27:27.630]  I would have done that long ago
[27:27.630 --> 27:29.630]  but the quota bullshit is a real hold up
[27:29.630 --> 27:31.630]  down there
[27:31.630 --> 27:33.630]  fascinating
[27:33.630 --> 27:35.630]  yeah the operation
[27:35.630 --> 27:37.630]  in Bechata
[27:37.630 --> 27:39.630]  they had a team of
[27:39.630 --> 27:41.630]  old cultivators, collectors
[27:41.630 --> 27:43.630]  that were from Cali
[27:43.630 --> 27:45.630]  and
[27:45.630 --> 27:47.630]  they had brought in all the lines
[27:47.630 --> 27:49.630]  to start doing the hybridization process
[27:49.630 --> 27:51.630]  there so they could start to work
[27:51.630 --> 27:53.630]  because they wanted to work with
[27:54.350 --> 27:56.350]  indigenous stock primarily
[27:56.350 --> 27:58.350]  and a lot of it was with botanical preservation
[27:58.350 --> 28:00.350]  and so that group was called the 8-fold
[28:00.350 --> 28:02.350]  and they had
[28:02.350 --> 28:04.350]  a huge preservation project
[28:04.350 --> 28:06.350]  for all botanical plants period
[28:06.350 --> 28:08.350]  so I want to say
[28:08.350 --> 28:10.350]  they had picked up maybe 2 million acres
[28:10.350 --> 28:12.350]  and I think 600,000 of them
[28:12.350 --> 28:14.350]  were set up for
[28:14.350 --> 28:16.350]  a botanical preservation
[28:16.350 --> 28:18.350]  and they had a real good buy in from
[28:18.350 --> 28:20.350]  all the old shaman
[28:20.350 --> 28:22.350]  because they were going to be able to start to
[28:23.070 --> 28:25.070]  hold land in fixed form
[28:25.070 --> 28:27.070]  so that it didn't get deforested
[28:27.070 --> 28:29.070]  so they could start to really put the effort
[28:29.070 --> 28:31.070]  into understanding what was the
[28:31.070 --> 28:33.070]  various plants
[28:33.070 --> 28:35.070]  that the Colombians had historically used
[28:35.070 --> 28:37.070]  for medicinal purposes
[28:37.070 --> 28:39.070]  and
[28:39.070 --> 28:41.070]  from being from the US
[28:41.070 --> 28:43.070]  I just felt so ignorant
[28:43.070 --> 28:45.070]  because we just don't operate
[28:45.070 --> 28:47.070]  like that
[28:47.070 --> 28:49.070]  we don't have that holistic
[28:49.070 --> 28:51.070]  connection to plants that they do
[28:51.790 --> 28:53.790]  the rainforest was this
[28:53.790 --> 28:55.790]  basket of wealth that they were able to
[28:55.790 --> 28:57.790]  draw from
[28:57.790 --> 28:59.790]  and for us where we've been bombarded
[28:59.790 --> 29:01.790]  with pharmacological
[29:01.790 --> 29:03.790]  direction for so long in the US
[29:03.790 --> 29:05.790]  that if you're someone who's taking
[29:05.790 --> 29:07.790]  care of yourself in a holistic manner
[29:07.790 --> 29:09.790]  using plant medicine you're basically
[29:09.790 --> 29:11.790]  a fucking nut
[29:11.790 --> 29:13.790]  and it was just so interesting
[29:13.790 --> 29:15.790]  to see
[29:15.790 --> 29:17.790]  it was just really nice to see
[29:17.790 --> 29:19.790]  the development and the preservation
[29:20.510 --> 29:22.510]  and the beginning of
[29:22.510 --> 29:24.510]  the botanical revolution is kind of how I saw
[29:24.510 --> 29:26.510]  it where they used to, because right now
[29:26.510 --> 29:28.510]  you're seeing the mushrooms becoming extremely
[29:28.510 --> 29:30.510]  popular and accepted
[29:30.510 --> 29:32.510]  and so you know cannabis broke
[29:32.510 --> 29:34.510]  that door open and now we're
[29:34.510 --> 29:36.510]  seeing the ayahuasca ceremonies
[29:36.510 --> 29:38.510]  you're seeing mushrooms coming
[29:38.510 --> 29:40.510]  into vogue and all
[29:40.510 --> 29:42.510]  these other plants that
[29:42.510 --> 29:44.510]  I had met some collectors that had collected
[29:44.510 --> 29:46.510]  for centuries and
[29:46.510 --> 29:48.510]  had collections at the villas
[29:49.230 --> 29:51.230]  and when I went out in the jungles with them to go look at the sites
[29:51.230 --> 29:53.230]  so we could try to figure out you know would it work
[29:53.230 --> 29:55.230]  it was just such a
[29:55.230 --> 29:57.230]  plant ID
[29:57.230 --> 29:59.230]  fest because you had
[29:59.230 --> 30:01.230]  people who had used plants
[30:01.230 --> 30:03.230]  so heavily for so long that they knew
[30:03.230 --> 30:05.230]  everything that was going on not just cannabis
[30:05.230 --> 30:07.230]  and so it was a really interesting
[30:07.230 --> 30:09.230]  experience I liked
[30:09.230 --> 30:11.230]  the way the natives had integrated
[30:11.230 --> 30:13.230]  so well
[30:13.230 --> 30:15.230]  and coca did the same thing
[30:15.230 --> 30:17.230]  that basically poppy did in
[30:17.950 --> 30:19.950]  Asia where it
[30:19.950 --> 30:21.950]  monocropped a region
[30:21.950 --> 30:23.950]  and it forced a direction
[30:23.950 --> 30:25.950]  for so long and then with
[30:25.950 --> 30:27.950]  the collapse as cocaine moves
[30:27.950 --> 30:29.950]  as they raid the areas and they have to
[30:29.950 --> 30:31.950]  keep moving the fields the areas
[30:31.950 --> 30:33.950]  that were once cocaine plantations
[30:33.950 --> 30:35.950]  or coca plantations now become
[30:35.950 --> 30:37.950]  open farmland again
[30:37.950 --> 30:39.950]  and so the
[30:39.950 --> 30:41.950]  operation outside of Bogota
[30:41.950 --> 30:43.950]  was they were really reclaiming
[30:43.950 --> 30:45.950]  old coca lands
[30:46.670 --> 30:48.670]  and then putting a program together
[30:48.670 --> 30:50.670]  where the farmers who used to farm the coca
[30:50.670 --> 30:52.670]  could now farm psychoactive
[30:52.670 --> 30:54.670]  cannabis and utilize the processing
[30:54.670 --> 30:56.670]  the micro propagation
[30:56.670 --> 30:58.670]  facilities because they had built
[30:58.670 --> 31:00.670]  a big micro prop lab up in the jungle
[31:00.670 --> 31:02.670]  but they staffed it with
[31:02.670 --> 31:04.670]  native Colombians who had been working in the
[31:04.670 --> 31:06.670]  floral industry just so they
[31:06.670 --> 31:08.670]  could simplify holding that many
[31:08.670 --> 31:10.670]  plants and
[31:10.670 --> 31:12.670]  it was just really
[31:12.670 --> 31:14.670]  a better system
[31:15.390 --> 31:17.390]  and their regulations are weird and you have to get your plants
[31:17.390 --> 31:19.390]  approved and you got to go through all the little hoops
[31:19.390 --> 31:21.390]  and bullshit but
[31:21.390 --> 31:23.390]  the way the
[31:23.390 --> 31:25.390]  natives worked with the plants was
[31:25.390 --> 31:27.390]  just such a more connected
[31:27.390 --> 31:29.390]  situation than we have in the states
[31:29.390 --> 31:31.390]  I think you know we've been so
[31:31.390 --> 31:33.390]  disconnected from agriculture
[31:33.390 --> 31:35.390]  on a craft level
[31:35.390 --> 31:37.390]  small scale level that we
[31:37.390 --> 31:39.390]  kind of forgot that people do that
[31:39.390 --> 31:41.390]  and so you know it's
[31:41.390 --> 31:43.390]  always refreshing to go out of the country
[31:44.110 --> 31:46.110]  and do some of the operations
[31:46.110 --> 31:48.110]  because I go to other places too
[31:48.110 --> 31:50.110]  and it's the same thing
[31:50.110 --> 31:52.110]  it's people that had to grow to eat
[31:52.110 --> 31:54.110]  they were producing things
[31:54.110 --> 31:56.110]  that they needed and they knew how to use
[31:56.110 --> 31:58.110]  the inputs from the property
[31:58.110 --> 32:00.110]  in ferments to give them
[32:00.110 --> 32:02.110]  the fertility because they didn't have
[32:02.110 --> 32:04.110]  the ability to import
[32:04.110 --> 32:06.110]  the materials that we typically would
[32:06.110 --> 32:08.110]  in the US
[32:08.110 --> 32:10.110]  and just a lot smarter
[32:10.110 --> 32:12.110]  there was an operation I went to take a look at
[32:12.830 --> 32:14.830]  and that you could grow nothing in it from the analysis
[32:14.830 --> 32:16.830]  and I was laughing because it was a huge
[32:16.830 --> 32:18.830]  cacao plantation
[32:18.830 --> 32:20.830]  and it was just lush and filled
[32:20.830 --> 32:22.830]  and
[32:22.830 --> 32:24.830]  it's the magic of biological
[32:24.830 --> 32:26.830]  delivery in those places where
[32:26.830 --> 32:28.830]  your biology is so unbelievably
[32:28.830 --> 32:30.830]  powerful that it can pull
[32:30.830 --> 32:32.830]  sparse nutrition and make it available
[32:32.830 --> 32:34.830]  and if you had seen
[32:34.830 --> 32:36.830]  this analysis from a lab
[32:36.830 --> 32:38.830]  you'd say that nothing could grow there but when you
[32:38.830 --> 32:40.830]  went to the location it was a jungle
[32:41.550 --> 32:43.550]  I know exactly what you mean
[32:43.550 --> 32:45.550]  it's a life factor
[32:45.550 --> 32:47.550]  yes
[32:47.550 --> 32:49.550]  and the same thing with the sun
[32:49.550 --> 32:51.550]  I used to work doing underwater
[32:51.550 --> 32:53.550]  construction on the equator
[32:53.550 --> 32:55.550]  back in the 80's
[32:55.550 --> 32:57.550]  and I remember the first time
[32:57.550 --> 32:59.550]  I went to work on this atoll
[32:59.550 --> 33:01.550]  I got a sunburn on my head
[33:01.550 --> 33:03.550]  through the mesh of my hat
[33:03.550 --> 33:05.550]  and I mean like it turned my scalp purple
[33:05.550 --> 33:07.550]  through the mesh
[33:07.550 --> 33:09.550]  and it wasn't that hot it was only like
[33:10.270 --> 33:12.270]  and so when I was in Columbia
[33:12.270 --> 33:14.270]  I laughed because I knew exactly that
[33:14.270 --> 33:16.270]  any time in the sun at all and you were going to get scalded
[33:16.270 --> 33:18.270]  yeah it's something different
[33:18.270 --> 33:20.270]  it's something different
[33:20.270 --> 33:22.270]  it's magic boy
[33:22.270 --> 33:24.270]  that is real sun
[33:24.270 --> 33:26.270]  and something about
[33:26.270 --> 33:28.270]  the way it must go through the atmosphere too
[33:28.270 --> 33:30.270]  the information it's conveying to the plants
[33:30.270 --> 33:32.270]  because you're getting the earlier
[33:32.270 --> 33:34.270]  finish, you're getting intensity
[33:34.270 --> 33:36.270]  but there has to be information that's moving
[33:36.270 --> 33:38.270]  in the light
[33:38.990 --> 33:40.990]  because of the angle of inclination
[33:40.990 --> 33:42.990]  it has to be a more direct flow
[33:42.990 --> 33:44.990]  I was doing
[33:44.990 --> 33:46.990]  I was involved in some of the first LED projects
[33:46.990 --> 33:48.990]  in the US with Heliospectra
[33:48.990 --> 33:50.990]  so Heliospectra
[33:50.990 --> 33:52.990]  didn't have an ability to test cannabis
[33:52.990 --> 33:54.990]  because they were from I want to say
[33:54.990 --> 33:56.990]  Sweden
[33:56.990 --> 33:58.990]  and they didn't have an ability to test cannabis
[33:58.990 --> 34:00.990]  so they looked into North America
[34:00.990 --> 34:02.990]  and I happened to pop up as someone that they could work with
[34:02.990 --> 34:04.990]  and so they flew in, we met
[34:04.990 --> 34:06.990]  and then I did the testing for them
[34:07.710 --> 34:09.710]  where we ran the same cultivars
[34:09.710 --> 34:11.710]  under conventional
[34:11.710 --> 34:13.710]  HPS
[34:13.710 --> 34:15.710]  and then we ran tests
[34:15.710 --> 34:17.710]  under the Heliospectra systems
[34:17.710 --> 34:19.710]  and they would fly light engineers
[34:19.710 --> 34:21.710]  in every couple weeks, months
[34:21.710 --> 34:23.710]  to do the testing and to work with us
[34:23.710 --> 34:25.710]  on the project
[34:25.710 --> 34:27.710]  and the information that I received from them
[34:27.710 --> 34:29.710]  was just fascinating
[34:29.710 --> 34:31.710]  because it was really about the information that travels
[34:31.710 --> 34:33.710]  in light that we don't understand
[34:33.710 --> 34:35.710]  so instead of just being a measure of energy
[34:36.430 --> 34:38.430]  it was also information
[34:38.430 --> 34:40.430]  and that if they could separate and bend
[34:40.430 --> 34:42.430]  the waves
[34:42.430 --> 34:44.430]  they could have plants flower
[34:44.430 --> 34:46.430]  change morphological shape
[34:46.430 --> 34:48.430]  coloration, different terpene profiles
[34:48.430 --> 34:50.430]  and the lights that I was using
[34:50.430 --> 34:52.430]  they had a complete range
[34:52.430 --> 34:54.430]  of adjustment
[34:54.430 --> 34:56.430]  where you could really work on any Kelvin
[34:56.430 --> 34:58.430]  so it almost had an equalizer
[34:58.430 --> 35:00.430]  and
[35:00.430 --> 35:02.430]  it was fascinating
[35:02.430 --> 35:04.430]  so we were able to play with it and see this stuff
[35:05.150 --> 35:07.150]  and I took them up the hill one time so they could see the outdoor
[35:07.150 --> 35:09.150]  that I had up on a mountain
[35:09.150 --> 35:11.150]  so this way they could take a look and see
[35:11.150 --> 35:13.150]  this is what outdoor looks like
[35:13.150 --> 35:15.150]  and then measure the sun
[35:15.150 --> 35:17.150]  and then try to understand what energy was being
[35:17.150 --> 35:19.150]  gathered
[35:19.150 --> 35:21.150]  and what the real spectra was
[35:21.150 --> 35:23.150]  so they were able to start to match up
[35:23.150 --> 35:25.150]  some of these details
[35:25.150 --> 35:27.150]  and it was just fascinating
[35:27.150 --> 35:29.150]  because these were brilliant, brilliant light engineers
[35:29.150 --> 35:31.150]  that had spent their whole life
[35:31.150 --> 35:33.150]  the lead engineer, I think her name was Tessa
[35:33.870 --> 35:35.870]  and she was at a research institute
[35:35.870 --> 35:37.870]  doing tobacco and hemp research
[35:37.870 --> 35:39.870]  but had a heavy cancer direction
[35:39.870 --> 35:41.870]  her husband had passed away from cancer
[35:41.870 --> 35:43.870]  and she had become just polarized
[35:43.870 --> 35:45.870]  in trying to understand the disease
[35:45.870 --> 35:47.870]  and because she had
[35:47.870 --> 35:49.870]  such a scientific background
[35:49.870 --> 35:51.870]  she was able to go work for a major group
[35:51.870 --> 35:53.870]  but because of that the funding was supernatural
[35:53.870 --> 35:55.870]  and so she was saying
[35:55.870 --> 35:57.870]  to me, she says
[35:57.870 --> 35:59.870]  that the light is information
[35:59.870 --> 36:01.870]  it's more than just energy
[36:02.590 --> 36:04.590]  I believe there's something there we don't measure yet
[36:04.590 --> 36:06.590]  I told her there's something there we can't measure yet
[36:32.590 --> 36:36.560]  and I was laughing
[36:36.560 --> 36:38.560]  and I'm like I don't think so
[36:38.560 --> 36:40.560]  I still don't think your light
[36:40.560 --> 36:42.560]  is better than the sun
[36:42.560 --> 36:44.560]  yet to see
[36:46.560 --> 36:48.560]  and by the way
[36:48.560 --> 36:50.560]  the fields I was mentioning
[36:50.560 --> 36:52.560]  was at 370 meters
[36:52.560 --> 36:54.560]  altitude
[36:54.560 --> 36:56.560]  and you were saying that Manizales was 2000
[36:56.560 --> 36:58.560]  and we were talking about the difference
[36:58.560 --> 37:00.560]  between the latitude
[37:00.560 --> 37:02.560]  and how it was magnified by the altitude
[37:03.280 --> 37:05.280]  it is very different
[37:05.280 --> 37:07.280]  and the lower altitudes
[37:07.280 --> 37:09.280]  are the really hot ones
[37:09.280 --> 37:11.280]  the sea level is cooking
[37:11.280 --> 37:13.280]  and the higher you go you get snow
[37:13.280 --> 37:15.280]  that was outside of the shot
[37:15.280 --> 37:17.280]  that was mold and grass
[37:17.280 --> 37:19.280]  the temperature was
[37:19.280 --> 37:21.280]  oppressive and the bugs were unreal
[37:21.280 --> 37:23.280]  the soil is red
[37:23.280 --> 37:25.280]  out there
[37:25.280 --> 37:27.280]  yes, and then outside
[37:27.280 --> 37:29.280]  of Bogota you were up in the mountains
[37:29.280 --> 37:31.280]  so you had a different climate
[37:32.000 --> 37:34.000]  and it was fascinating to be able to work
[37:34.000 --> 37:36.000]  on both of those regions repetitively
[37:36.000 --> 37:38.000]  you can have different lines to grow up high
[37:38.000 --> 37:40.000]  and different lines everywhere
[37:40.000 --> 37:42.000]  in the way that I've done
[37:46.000 --> 37:48.000]  I know I just went in a total circle
[37:48.000 --> 37:50.000]  there I couldn't help it
[37:50.000 --> 37:52.000]  I was like I have to close that thought
[37:52.000 --> 37:54.000]  I have to tell you
[37:54.000 --> 37:56.000]  I haven't smoked a fucking thing or a dab
[37:56.000 --> 37:58.000]  all day but I made my
[37:58.000 --> 38:00.000]  home fries
[38:00.720 --> 38:02.720]  I made my own infused cannabis oil
[38:02.720 --> 38:04.720]  this morning
[38:04.720 --> 38:06.720]  just the old school kind
[38:06.720 --> 38:08.720]  where you just take cooking oil
[38:08.720 --> 38:10.720]  this was olive oil
[38:10.720 --> 38:12.720]  and then three times cooked fan leaves
[38:12.720 --> 38:14.720]  in the same oil
[38:14.720 --> 38:16.720]  and then you just put jars of that away
[38:16.720 --> 38:18.720]  that's just like the lowest tech
[38:18.720 --> 38:20.720]  way to use fan leaves
[38:20.720 --> 38:22.720]  in the middle of the summer
[38:22.720 --> 38:24.720]  and these were from last year
[38:24.720 --> 38:26.720]  I just never finish those jars
[38:26.720 --> 38:28.720]  I give them away
[38:29.440 --> 38:31.440]  I have a couple of leaves and they give me back jars
[38:31.440 --> 38:33.440]  but I haven't been using that lately
[38:33.440 --> 38:35.440]  so this morning I did the potatoes in it
[38:35.440 --> 38:37.440]  and by like that was
[38:37.440 --> 38:39.440]  8 o'clock or something
[38:39.440 --> 38:41.440]  and by like 11 I was like oh my god
[38:41.440 --> 38:43.440]  I hope I can talk at 3
[38:43.440 --> 38:45.440]  I was damaged goods
[38:45.440 --> 38:47.440]  I was just coming back to the earth
[38:47.440 --> 38:49.440]  and I was like I gotta grab a beer
[38:49.440 --> 38:51.440]  I am just angry
[38:51.440 --> 38:53.440]  I love it
[38:53.440 --> 38:55.440]  Well Steve
[38:55.440 --> 38:57.440]  we could change that
[38:58.160 --> 39:00.160]  I am actually
[39:00.160 --> 39:02.160]  maybe when Gemma goes back upstairs
[39:02.160 --> 39:04.160]  I will start smoking
[39:06.160 --> 39:08.160]  Oh my god
[39:08.160 --> 39:10.160]  we had a girl that used to come by
[39:10.160 --> 39:12.160]  she used to cook edibles for us at the shop
[39:12.160 --> 39:14.160]  and she would do the same thing
[39:14.160 --> 39:16.160]  she would make an oil solution
[39:16.160 --> 39:18.160]  and infuse the cannabis into it
[39:18.160 --> 39:20.160]  then cook the food
[39:20.160 --> 39:22.160]  and I remember we did not expect to get as lit
[39:22.160 --> 39:24.160]  as we got me and my business partner
[39:24.160 --> 39:26.160]  were cracking up
[39:26.880 --> 39:28.880]  Should we close the shop?
[39:28.880 --> 39:30.880]  We were not sure if we could function
[39:30.880 --> 39:32.880]  I will never forget
[39:32.880 --> 39:34.880]  the first time I did that
[39:34.880 --> 39:36.880]  I did it with
[39:36.880 --> 39:38.880]  it was my second year growing
[39:38.880 --> 39:40.880]  and I had 3 northern lights plants
[39:40.880 --> 39:42.880]  guerrilla style outside in southwestern Ontario
[39:42.880 --> 39:44.880]  and I went
[39:44.880 --> 39:46.880]  I ended with 3
[39:46.880 --> 39:48.880]  I started with 6
[39:48.880 --> 39:50.880]  but I had the 3 males earlier
[39:50.880 --> 39:52.880]  I took them out
[39:52.880 --> 39:54.880]  and just stripped them
[39:55.600 --> 39:57.600]  and opened basically
[39:57.600 --> 39:59.600]  you could see them there
[39:59.600 --> 40:01.600]  stripped the leaves down
[40:01.600 --> 40:03.600]  went and dried them in a friends oven
[40:03.600 --> 40:05.600]  cooked them down in 5 gallons of sunflower seed oil
[40:05.600 --> 40:07.600]  or something
[40:07.600 --> 40:09.600]  and then made
[40:09.600 --> 40:11.600]  squares
[40:11.600 --> 40:13.600]  and we were so polluted
[40:13.600 --> 40:15.600]  we had no idea
[40:15.600 --> 40:17.600]  and we ate them going over the bridge
[40:17.600 --> 40:19.600]  from Sarnia into Port Huron
[40:19.600 --> 40:21.600]  going to see the Grateful Dead
[40:21.600 --> 40:23.600]  at the Auburn Hills Palace
[40:24.320 --> 40:26.320]  we were eating it
[40:26.320 --> 40:28.320]  when we were getting up to the bridge
[40:28.320 --> 40:30.320]  and we were like choke them back
[40:30.320 --> 40:32.320]  there's no line up
[40:32.320 --> 40:34.320]  so we're wolfing this down
[40:34.320 --> 40:36.320]  as fast as we can
[40:36.320 --> 40:38.320]  and I pull over to get a map
[40:38.320 --> 40:40.320]  just past the border
[40:40.320 --> 40:42.320]  and I asked the border guard
[40:42.320 --> 40:44.320]  which way is Auburn Hills
[40:44.320 --> 40:46.320]  and he said I don't have to tell you
[40:46.320 --> 40:48.320]  good luck
[40:48.320 --> 40:50.320]  we were just going to support
[40:50.320 --> 40:52.320]  guys in the jeep
[40:53.040 --> 40:55.040]  classic
[40:55.040 --> 40:57.040]  Gemma's hanging with me right now
[40:57.040 --> 40:59.040]  alright
[40:59.040 --> 41:01.040]  go easy
[41:03.040 --> 41:05.040]  I know she can't hear anything
[41:05.040 --> 41:07.040]  alright
[41:07.040 --> 41:09.040]  you cannot
[41:09.040 --> 41:11.040]  so just quickly
[41:11.040 --> 41:13.040]  here let me get back to me
[41:13.040 --> 41:15.040]  so
[41:15.040 --> 41:17.040]  Elka
[41:17.040 --> 41:19.040]  just someone had a question
[41:19.040 --> 41:21.040]  so let me just quickly queue it up
[41:23.040 --> 41:25.040]  so I don't know if you guys can
[41:25.040 --> 41:27.040]  let me read it for those who need reading glasses
[41:27.040 --> 41:29.040]  but it basically says
[41:29.040 --> 41:31.040]  so this relates to
[41:31.040 --> 41:33.040]  when Steve and I last spoke
[41:33.040 --> 41:35.040]  we talked about
[41:35.040 --> 41:37.040]  the seedless females
[41:37.040 --> 41:39.040]  and so Elka said
[41:39.040 --> 41:41.040]  I would like to hear Steve and Kevin's thoughts
[41:41.040 --> 41:43.040]  on a subject that is related to Steve's current work
[41:43.040 --> 41:45.040]  involving seedless females
[41:45.040 --> 41:47.040]  what are their thoughts on the immature seeds
[41:47.040 --> 41:49.040]  that develop in the calyx without being
[41:49.040 --> 41:51.040]  fertilized
[41:51.760 --> 41:53.760]  so the ovule was not fertilized
[41:53.760 --> 41:55.760]  because they developed for weeks
[41:55.760 --> 41:57.760]  and the pistil does not wither
[41:57.760 --> 41:59.760]  and turn red or brown
[41:59.760 --> 42:01.760]  what do they think causes this in cannabis
[42:01.760 --> 42:03.760]  and do they think it has any potential
[42:03.760 --> 42:05.760]  besides ruining the taste of flowers
[42:05.760 --> 42:07.760]  this phenomena is commonly used
[42:07.760 --> 42:09.760]  in other botanical pursuits
[42:09.760 --> 42:11.760]  such as seedless watermelons
[42:11.760 --> 42:13.760]  it has several names
[42:13.760 --> 42:15.760]  and I'm not sure which one would apply to cannabis
[42:15.760 --> 42:17.760]  they are agam, moss, permy
[42:17.760 --> 42:19.760]  apomixus and parthenocarpy
[42:20.480 --> 42:22.480]  anyway
[42:22.480 --> 42:24.480]  and go
[42:24.480 --> 42:26.480]  in short
[42:26.480 --> 42:28.480]  what you want is parthenocarpy
[42:28.480 --> 42:30.480]  that's the virgin fruit
[42:30.480 --> 42:32.480]  you don't get the little aborted
[42:32.480 --> 42:34.480]  seeds because it doesn't take
[42:34.480 --> 42:36.480]  the pollen to begin with
[42:36.480 --> 42:38.480]  so parthenocarpy is what you want
[42:38.480 --> 42:40.480]  lots of people
[42:40.480 --> 42:42.480]  are doing polyploids
[42:42.480 --> 42:44.480]  and getting the same
[42:44.480 --> 42:46.480]  type of plants you'd get
[42:46.480 --> 42:48.480]  with a seedless watermelon with the little
[42:49.200 --> 42:51.200]  aborted white pips
[42:51.200 --> 42:53.200]  that you'd get in a seedless grapes too
[42:53.200 --> 42:55.200]  those are polyploids
[42:55.200 --> 42:57.200]  and you see better results
[42:57.200 --> 42:59.200]  in monoploids
[42:59.200 --> 43:01.200]  which can be double haploids
[43:01.200 --> 43:03.200]  but essentially
[43:03.200 --> 43:05.200]  the accidental way of coming across
[43:05.200 --> 43:07.200]  and which I've seen more than one person
[43:07.200 --> 43:09.200]  come up with now
[43:09.200 --> 43:11.200]  I think there's got to be at least five people
[43:11.200 --> 43:13.200]  that through back crossing feminized
[43:13.200 --> 43:15.200]  start finding
[43:15.200 --> 43:17.200]  sterile plants
[43:17.920 --> 43:19.920]  and don't make aborted little white seeds
[43:19.920 --> 43:21.920]  I think
[43:21.920 --> 43:23.920]  I want to say
[43:23.920 --> 43:25.920]  which is a group out of Oregon
[43:25.920 --> 43:27.920]  Oregon CBD maybe
[43:27.920 --> 43:29.920]  the Crawfords
[43:29.920 --> 43:31.920]  they just came up with
[43:31.920 --> 43:33.920]  sterile females
[43:33.920 --> 43:35.920]  so that you have no ability
[43:35.920 --> 43:37.920]  the double haploid
[43:37.920 --> 43:39.920]  impossible for it to pollinate
[43:39.920 --> 43:41.920]  so that you don't have the immature seed develop
[43:41.920 --> 43:43.920]  I think they're the first ones
[43:43.920 --> 43:45.920]  to really come out with it on a commercial line level
[43:46.640 --> 43:48.640]  that's awesome
[43:48.640 --> 43:50.640]  yeah no because the bottom line
[43:50.640 --> 43:52.640]  is anything that's going to degrade
[43:52.640 --> 43:54.640]  the quality in any capacity
[43:54.640 --> 43:56.640]  is just deadly
[43:56.640 --> 43:58.640]  if it
[43:58.640 --> 44:00.640]  takes away from extraction
[44:00.640 --> 44:02.640]  potential because by virtue of the weight
[44:02.640 --> 44:04.640]  of the substance within the material
[44:04.640 --> 44:06.640]  that doesn't have value
[44:06.640 --> 44:08.640]  you lose money
[44:08.640 --> 44:10.640]  for people who are consuming it on a smoke level
[44:10.640 --> 44:12.640]  it has, it imparts a different
[44:12.640 --> 44:14.640]  flavor to the product
[44:15.360 --> 44:17.360]  sound effects
[44:17.360 --> 44:19.360]  and that's what we used to see with a lot of the feminized work
[44:19.360 --> 44:21.360]  we would see this on a microscope
[44:21.360 --> 44:23.360]  you could come inside and see the microscopic seed formation
[44:23.360 --> 44:25.360]  but
[44:25.360 --> 44:27.360]  I don't see it as much now in general
[44:27.360 --> 44:29.360]  I think that the people who were doing a lot of the fem work
[44:29.360 --> 44:31.360]  and producing it started really
[44:31.360 --> 44:33.360]  dialing in their direction
[44:33.360 --> 44:35.360]  so that they were able to get plants
[44:35.360 --> 44:37.360]  that didn't accept the pollen
[44:37.360 --> 44:39.360]  you didn't have pollination
[44:39.360 --> 44:41.360]  you never had the seed formation at all
[44:41.360 --> 44:43.360]  never mind a viable seed
[44:44.080 --> 44:46.080]  the first time I found one
[44:46.080 --> 44:48.080]  was six feminized
[44:48.080 --> 44:50.080]  seed which I didn't even know were feminized
[44:50.080 --> 44:52.080]  seed, they were just bag seeds out of some special
[44:52.080 --> 44:54.080]  flower and I was told
[44:54.080 --> 44:56.080]  if you find some seeds in there you're lucky
[44:56.080 --> 44:58.080]  and my friends pulled
[44:58.080 --> 45:00.080]  the two seeds they each found
[45:00.080 --> 45:02.080]  and I planted six and I got six female
[45:02.080 --> 45:04.080]  plants but three of them
[45:04.080 --> 45:06.080]  had no pistils and in a
[45:06.080 --> 45:08.080]  room full of pollen, I even took
[45:08.080 --> 45:10.080]  pollen and just rubbed it
[45:10.080 --> 45:12.080]  on those plants, tried to squeeze it into
[45:12.800 --> 45:14.800]  them, I couldn't get them to take seed
[45:14.800 --> 45:16.800]  on those first ones
[45:16.800 --> 45:18.800]  and then I've seen the phenomena or heard it
[45:18.800 --> 45:20.800]  from other people and
[45:20.800 --> 45:22.800]  people are finding it
[45:22.800 --> 45:24.800]  so it doesn't shock me
[45:24.800 --> 45:26.800]  there's some out now in the states, that's awesome
[45:26.800 --> 45:28.800]  I think in five years you're going to be
[45:28.800 --> 45:30.800]  hard pressed to find
[45:30.800 --> 45:32.800]  even
[45:32.800 --> 45:34.800]  commercial growers really
[45:34.800 --> 45:36.800]  grow plants that have even a chance
[45:36.800 --> 45:38.800]  of making a partial seed
[45:38.800 --> 45:40.800]  seedless
[45:41.520 --> 45:43.520]  for people that are smoking pot
[45:43.520 --> 45:45.520]  pretty essential and in Canada
[45:45.520 --> 45:47.520]  in the legal market it's been
[45:47.520 --> 45:49.520]  an open joke how many times people
[45:49.520 --> 45:51.520]  have got seeded bud and even
[45:51.520 --> 45:53.520]  worse, they've sold seeded pre-rolled
[45:53.520 --> 45:55.520]  multiple times from the same
[45:55.520 --> 45:57.520]  producer that were 50% of their
[45:57.520 --> 45:59.520]  weight in seed
[45:59.520 --> 46:01.520]  50% of the weight seed
[46:01.520 --> 46:03.520]  like these
[46:03.520 --> 46:05.520]  companies are billion dollar companies
[46:05.520 --> 46:07.520]  look at this bullshit
[46:07.520 --> 46:09.520]  tell me
[46:10.240 --> 46:12.240]  if they can cover their ass by growing sterile
[46:12.240 --> 46:14.240]  females, they will be
[46:14.240 --> 46:16.240]  legally obligated to by their
[46:16.240 --> 46:18.240]  shareholders before you're risking
[46:18.240 --> 46:20.240]  crop failure
[46:20.240 --> 46:22.240]  everybody's going to be growing sterile females
[46:22.240 --> 46:24.240]  in five years, I think it's just a question
[46:24.240 --> 46:26.240]  of time because the process
[46:26.240 --> 46:28.240]  takes a couple
[46:28.240 --> 46:30.240]  generations and
[46:30.240 --> 46:32.240]  it can be done for any cutting
[46:32.240 --> 46:34.240]  right?
[46:34.240 --> 46:36.240]  everything will be made a sterile version
[46:36.240 --> 46:38.240]  of itself
[46:38.960 --> 46:40.960]  on the cutting menu now
[46:40.960 --> 46:42.960]  in a couple years, it will be the same cutting menu
[46:42.960 --> 46:44.960]  it might be a transition time
[46:44.960 --> 46:46.960]  where you can get it regular or sterile
[46:46.960 --> 46:48.960]  but eventually
[46:48.960 --> 46:50.960]  it will be sterile, just like the seeds all went female
[46:50.960 --> 46:52.960]  you know people
[46:52.960 --> 46:54.960]  you know what I mean? it will happen
[46:54.960 --> 46:56.960]  it will be a huge shift to sterile
[46:56.960 --> 46:58.960]  and it will
[46:58.960 --> 47:00.960]  cut down on the risk of seeded pot
[47:00.960 --> 47:02.960]  for tons of people
[47:02.960 --> 47:04.960]  it will save outdoors bacon
[47:04.960 --> 47:06.960]  because there's all kinds of hemp farmers
[47:07.680 --> 47:09.680]  in the wrong places
[47:09.680 --> 47:11.680]  like in Canada, if they kept the hemp
[47:11.680 --> 47:13.680]  in the prairies, they could grow good weed
[47:13.680 --> 47:15.680]  in southern Ontario
[47:15.680 --> 47:17.680]  but if they grow hemp in southern Ontario
[47:17.680 --> 47:19.680]  it's all over for traditional cannabis
[47:19.680 --> 47:21.680]  so if they're not growing sterile cannabis
[47:21.680 --> 47:23.680]  they won't be growing beautiful outdoor there
[47:23.680 --> 47:25.680]  they just can't
[47:25.680 --> 47:27.680]  they banned hemp in Humboldt County
[47:27.680 --> 47:29.680]  because of that
[47:29.680 --> 47:31.680]  Humboldt County banned hemp
[47:31.680 --> 47:33.680]  just because they didn't have
[47:33.680 --> 47:35.680]  an ability to really understand pollen drift
[47:36.400 --> 47:38.400]  because they weren't really sure
[47:38.400 --> 47:40.400]  with the prevailing winds
[47:40.400 --> 47:42.400]  because it's so windy
[47:42.400 --> 47:44.400]  where would these pollen clouds move
[47:44.400 --> 47:46.400]  so what was safety zones
[47:46.400 --> 47:48.400]  and because Humboldt was so predominantly
[47:48.400 --> 47:50.400]  you know, cannabinoid direction cannabis
[47:50.400 --> 47:52.400]  versus CBD only focus
[47:52.400 --> 47:54.400]  they just banned hemp
[47:54.400 --> 47:56.400]  until they could figure out what to do
[47:56.400 --> 47:58.400]  but I think a lot of the problem
[47:58.400 --> 48:00.400]  when you start to go into the sterility
[48:00.400 --> 48:02.400]  is it's also a control mechanism
[48:02.400 --> 48:04.400]  for the R&D
[48:05.120 --> 48:07.120]  you can put this money in to develop varieties
[48:07.120 --> 48:09.120]  that are excellent
[48:09.120 --> 48:11.120]  but the problem is
[48:11.120 --> 48:13.120]  and it protects you as the developer
[48:13.120 --> 48:15.120]  it protects the licensee
[48:15.120 --> 48:17.120]  but it doesn't allow the technology
[48:17.120 --> 48:19.120]  to move and utilize
[48:19.120 --> 48:21.120]  some of these incredible gene packages
[48:21.120 --> 48:23.120]  well, you know
[48:23.120 --> 48:25.120]  I think it's great to have every hobby breeder
[48:25.120 --> 48:27.120]  I started as a hobby breeder
[48:27.120 --> 48:29.120]  that's really the joy of it
[48:29.120 --> 48:31.120]  and I would always want to
[48:31.120 --> 48:33.120]  but if production goes to sterile
[48:33.840 --> 48:35.840]  I can't blame them
[48:35.840 --> 48:37.840]  it's not going to make us obsolete
[48:37.840 --> 48:39.840]  that are breeding
[48:39.840 --> 48:41.840]  and breeding stuff will be
[48:41.840 --> 48:43.840]  the only people with plants that can get pregnant
[48:43.840 --> 48:45.840]  people that are growing straight up for production
[48:45.840 --> 48:47.840]  the average guy growing half a dozen plants
[48:47.840 --> 48:49.840]  in his backyard isn't breeding either
[48:49.840 --> 48:51.840]  he just wants to fill up some jars
[48:51.840 --> 48:53.840]  for the winter
[48:53.840 --> 48:55.840]  and if he can make sure
[48:55.840 --> 48:57.840]  he doesn't get his neighbor's pollen over here
[48:57.840 --> 48:59.840]  all the better
[48:59.840 --> 49:01.840]  and the nice thing
[49:02.560 --> 49:04.560]  from the production perspective
[49:04.560 --> 49:06.560]  besides that you never ever have a seeded bud
[49:06.560 --> 49:08.560]  is they root
[49:08.560 --> 49:10.560]  in three or four days
[49:10.560 --> 49:12.560]  and they say it's common
[49:12.560 --> 49:14.560]  to plants of that ploidy
[49:14.560 --> 49:16.560]  that they will have an accelerated rooting
[49:16.560 --> 49:18.560]  schedule
[49:18.560 --> 49:20.560]  and it's bizarre because the sisters
[49:20.560 --> 49:22.560]  with pistils would take 12 days to root
[49:22.560 --> 49:24.560]  and the ones with no pistils
[49:24.560 --> 49:26.560]  would root in three or four days
[49:26.560 --> 49:28.560]  it was uncanny
[49:28.560 --> 49:30.560]  is that a linkage drag?
[49:31.280 --> 49:33.280]  I don't know how it works
[49:33.280 --> 49:35.280]  but I've read about the phenomena
[49:35.280 --> 49:37.280]  occurring in other plants
[49:37.280 --> 49:39.280]  with the same makeup
[49:39.280 --> 49:41.280]  they say once you've strangled
[49:41.280 --> 49:43.280]  the potential for it to reproduce sexually
[49:43.280 --> 49:45.280]  it wants to throw out roots
[49:45.280 --> 49:47.280]  and spread that way
[49:47.280 --> 49:49.280]  it's interesting
[49:49.280 --> 49:51.280]  but I think you'll see tons of it
[49:51.280 --> 49:53.280]  and it will come through tissue culture
[49:53.280 --> 49:55.280]  because immediately people are going to
[49:55.280 --> 49:57.280]  want consistency
[49:57.280 --> 49:59.280]  and the problem with the sterile seeds
[50:00.000 --> 50:02.000]  to use to go plant a field right now
[50:02.000 --> 50:04.000]  which I'd love to do
[50:04.000 --> 50:06.000]  is I can't
[50:06.000 --> 50:08.000]  as soon as you make one sterile
[50:08.000 --> 50:10.000]  it doesn't guarantee
[50:10.000 --> 50:12.000]  that you're going to get the whole population
[50:12.000 --> 50:14.000]  of seeds sterile
[50:14.000 --> 50:16.000]  so you might start out getting 50% sterility
[50:16.000 --> 50:18.000]  which may not really be good enough
[50:18.000 --> 50:20.000]  to call it a sterile crop
[50:20.000 --> 50:22.000]  you might have seeded half the crop
[50:22.000 --> 50:24.000]  so it's going to be propagated
[50:24.000 --> 50:26.000]  through micro propagation
[50:26.000 --> 50:28.000]  and then they can go out
[50:28.720 --> 50:30.720]  as efficient as a seed
[50:30.720 --> 50:32.720]  if they're done as synthetic seeds
[50:32.720 --> 50:34.720]  or artificial seeds
[50:34.720 --> 50:36.720]  they can take the one plant
[50:36.720 --> 50:38.720]  that was sterile
[50:38.720 --> 50:40.720]  and really resistant to whatever
[50:40.720 --> 50:42.720]  boom, let's go to town with that one
[50:42.720 --> 50:44.720]  and ideally
[50:44.720 --> 50:46.720]  I'd love to be able to make those
[50:46.720 --> 50:48.720]  seed seeds
[50:48.720 --> 50:50.720]  that you could rely on them coming up
[50:50.720 --> 50:52.720]  100% sterile females
[50:52.720 --> 50:54.720]  as a seed seed
[50:54.720 --> 50:56.720]  but I think before you get to that point
[50:57.440 --> 50:59.440]  I don't know that there will be enough people
[50:59.440 --> 51:01.440]  trying to grow mechanized
[51:01.440 --> 51:03.440]  cannabis by them as they do with hemp
[51:03.440 --> 51:05.440]  but if it happens
[51:05.440 --> 51:07.440]  that would be a thing
[51:07.440 --> 51:09.440]  and I'm certainly
[51:09.440 --> 51:11.440]  trying for that
[51:11.440 --> 51:13.440]  that's why I went to the plains
[51:13.440 --> 51:15.440]  because I wanted to be somewhere
[51:15.440 --> 51:17.440]  we could harvest with combines
[51:17.440 --> 51:19.440]  and plant with seed drills
[51:19.440 --> 51:21.440]  once we declimatized the plant we wanted to use
[51:21.440 --> 51:23.440]  and ideally made it a sterile version
[51:23.440 --> 51:25.440]  of itself
[51:26.160 --> 51:28.160]  it's just so nice to think of
[51:28.160 --> 51:30.160]  making it on that kind
[51:30.160 --> 51:32.160]  of a scale where you can make it
[51:32.160 --> 51:34.160]  as affordable as vegetable oil
[51:34.160 --> 51:36.160]  or something
[51:36.160 --> 51:38.160]  where farms
[51:38.160 --> 51:40.160]  10,000 acres
[51:40.160 --> 51:42.160]  that are flat enough to run machinery
[51:42.160 --> 51:44.160]  those are the farms I would love
[51:44.160 --> 51:46.160]  to see growing there
[51:46.160 --> 51:48.160]  and just to crash the price of them
[51:48.160 --> 51:50.160]  globally
[51:50.160 --> 51:52.160]  that would be
[51:52.160 --> 51:54.160]  a beautiful thing
[51:54.880 --> 51:56.880]  they're not going to do artisanal sugar
[51:56.880 --> 51:58.880]  anytime soon
[51:58.880 --> 52:00.880]  it's nice to have
[52:00.880 --> 52:02.880]  local craft products
[52:02.880 --> 52:04.880]  but Canadians import coffee
[52:04.880 --> 52:06.880]  they don't grow coffee in greenhouses
[52:06.880 --> 52:08.880]  it just wouldn't make sense
[52:08.880 --> 52:10.880]  or indoors
[52:10.880 --> 52:12.880]  yeah or indoors
[52:12.880 --> 52:14.880]  it just doesn't make sense
[52:14.880 --> 52:16.880]  it's a hangover of prohibition
[52:16.880 --> 52:18.880]  and it's a great hobby thing
[52:18.880 --> 52:20.880]  I get it
[52:20.880 --> 52:22.880]  I would totally grow indoors living in BC
[52:23.600 --> 52:25.600]  and right now I haven't grown indoors
[52:25.600 --> 52:27.600]  since 2002
[52:27.600 --> 52:29.600]  so I just do some
[52:29.600 --> 52:31.600]  plants every summer
[52:31.600 --> 52:33.600]  and here
[52:33.600 --> 52:35.600]  at home for fun
[52:35.600 --> 52:37.600]  but you can't finish great pot
[52:37.600 --> 52:39.600]  in most of Canada
[52:39.600 --> 52:41.600]  outside unless you do like that
[52:41.600 --> 52:43.600]  but BC you're just too far north
[52:43.600 --> 52:45.600]  at summer solstice
[52:45.600 --> 52:47.600]  in my area
[52:47.600 --> 52:49.600]  in Okanogan Valley
[52:49.600 --> 52:51.600]  at summer solstice you get
[52:52.320 --> 52:54.320]  18.5 hours of sunlight
[52:54.320 --> 52:56.320]  and in southwestern
[52:56.320 --> 52:58.320]  Ontario where I was from
[52:58.320 --> 53:00.320]  you get 16 hours of sunlight
[53:00.320 --> 53:02.320]  so think where they would go
[53:02.320 --> 53:04.320]  into flowers junior right
[53:04.320 --> 53:06.320]  just quickly
[53:06.320 --> 53:08.320]  this is Steve
[53:08.320 --> 53:10.320]  you're the
[53:10.320 --> 53:12.320]  leg model in this picture correct
[53:12.320 --> 53:14.320]  that's right
[53:14.320 --> 53:16.320]  my friend actually told me yesterday
[53:16.320 --> 53:18.320]  that I had really nice feet
[53:19.040 --> 53:21.040]  she meant it
[53:21.040 --> 53:23.040]  when you're not breathing
[53:23.040 --> 53:25.040]  there's nothing else to compliment
[53:25.040 --> 53:27.040]  you're looking for something
[53:27.040 --> 53:29.040]  you've got nice feet
[53:29.040 --> 53:31.040]  think what I can get
[53:31.040 --> 53:33.040]  new career
[53:33.040 --> 53:35.040]  yeah
[53:35.040 --> 53:37.040]  when you were doing
[53:37.040 --> 53:39.040]  all your initial work
[53:39.040 --> 53:41.040]  I got exposed to you
[53:41.040 --> 53:43.040]  I want to say I got my hands on
[53:43.040 --> 53:45.040]  some of your stock
[53:45.040 --> 53:47.040]  late 80s early 90s
[53:47.760 --> 53:49.760]  early 90s
[53:49.760 --> 53:51.760]  I started
[53:51.760 --> 53:53.760]  releasing seed officially
[53:53.760 --> 53:55.760]  in 94 I started giving it away
[53:55.760 --> 53:57.760]  probably in 1990
[53:57.760 --> 53:59.760]  reading as a hobby and sharing it with anybody
[53:59.760 --> 54:01.760]  that wanted to get started
[54:01.760 --> 54:03.760]  20 seeds in a page
[54:03.760 --> 54:05.760]  how to grow it
[54:05.760 --> 54:07.760]  I was just into
[54:07.760 --> 54:09.760]  spreading the love
[54:09.760 --> 54:11.760]  everybody want to buy your nug
[54:11.760 --> 54:13.760]  if you're the only guy growing
[54:13.760 --> 54:15.760]  nice frosty green buds
[54:16.480 --> 54:18.480]  I'd be like
[54:18.480 --> 54:20.480]  man I've got like
[54:20.480 --> 54:22.480]  one pound of this
[54:22.480 --> 54:24.480]  I'm not selling any of it
[54:24.480 --> 54:26.480]  I'll share it with you every time I see you
[54:26.480 --> 54:28.480]  but I won't sell you any
[54:28.480 --> 54:30.480]  I'll give you 20 seeds and tell you how to do it yourself
[54:30.480 --> 54:32.480]  and then boom
[54:32.480 --> 54:34.480]  you'd get it figured out
[54:34.480 --> 54:36.480]  you'd teach 10 of your friends
[54:36.480 --> 54:38.480]  people would just
[54:38.480 --> 54:40.480]  get excited about it
[54:40.480 --> 54:42.480]  some people would kill the 20 plants
[54:42.480 --> 54:44.480]  and other people would get them going
[54:45.200 --> 54:47.200]  it was just a hobby
[54:47.200 --> 54:49.200]  totally started as a hobby
[54:49.200 --> 54:51.200]  they started
[54:51.200 --> 54:53.200]  selling seeds as
[54:53.200 --> 54:55.200]  spice of life seeds in 94
[54:55.200 --> 54:57.200]  and that was
[54:57.200 --> 54:59.200]  the first releases
[54:59.200 --> 55:01.200]  first release was
[55:01.200 --> 55:03.200]  Jolly Rancher
[55:03.200 --> 55:05.200]  and then a number of Sweet Pink Grapefruit
[55:05.200 --> 55:07.200]  Five Alive
[55:07.200 --> 55:09.200]  a few other ones
[55:09.200 --> 55:11.200]  and what's known as the
[55:11.200 --> 55:13.200]  Sweets Gun
[55:13.920 --> 55:15.920]  95 I think is when
[55:15.920 --> 55:17.920]  the really fun ones came out
[55:17.920 --> 55:19.920]  and then 96 was when
[55:19.920 --> 55:21.920]  the Sweet Tooth Shishkaberry
[55:21.920 --> 55:23.920]  Plum Bud Blue Domino
[55:23.920 --> 55:25.920]  was pollinated
[55:25.920 --> 55:27.920]  that room and the Sweet Tooth and Shishkaberry
[55:27.920 --> 55:29.920]  carried on strong out of there
[55:29.920 --> 55:31.920]  the Blue Domino got
[55:31.920 --> 55:33.920]  sold almost entirely to one shop
[55:33.920 --> 55:35.920]  in Ottawa and still
[55:35.920 --> 55:37.920]  in Ottawa they grow Blue Domino
[55:37.920 --> 55:39.920]  but it didn't go anywhere else
[55:39.920 --> 55:41.920]  they loved it and they just cleaned me out of it
[55:42.640 --> 55:44.640]  and then the Plum Bud
[55:44.640 --> 55:46.640]  was a Corolla
[55:46.640 --> 55:48.640]  a pure Corolla from South India
[55:48.640 --> 55:50.640]  that got hit with the same special
[55:50.640 --> 55:52.640]  Blueberry Dad that made the
[55:52.640 --> 55:54.640]  F1 Sweet Tooth and Shishkaberry
[55:54.640 --> 55:56.640]  so when it hit
[55:56.640 --> 55:58.640]  when it hit Dutch Treat
[55:58.640 --> 56:00.640]  it became the Blue Domino
[56:00.640 --> 56:02.640]  and when it hit
[56:02.640 --> 56:04.640]  the Corolla
[56:04.640 --> 56:06.640]  which was like baby Aspirin
[56:06.640 --> 56:08.640]  it had a faint candy orange
[56:08.640 --> 56:10.640]  nose it was really nice and soft smoking
[56:11.360 --> 56:13.360]  but very not strong weed
[56:13.360 --> 56:15.360]  pleasant weed
[56:15.360 --> 56:17.360]  but it would have been
[56:17.360 --> 56:19.360]  super interesting crossed with that Blueberry
[56:19.360 --> 56:21.360]  I never even grew one out
[56:21.360 --> 56:23.360]  because I had a Chinese friend
[56:23.360 --> 56:25.360]  that was going back to Southern China
[56:25.360 --> 56:27.360]  and wanted to have
[56:27.360 --> 56:29.360]  the arm he planted
[56:29.360 --> 56:31.360]  for him
[56:31.360 --> 56:33.360]  he said
[56:33.360 --> 56:35.360]  how many of you got through somewhere hot and humid
[56:35.360 --> 56:37.360]  and it was like the only thing I had
[56:37.360 --> 56:39.360]  that was
[56:40.080 --> 56:42.080]  like mom
[56:42.080 --> 56:44.080]  we can still say that
[56:44.080 --> 56:46.080]  and I thought this would be your best hope
[56:46.080 --> 56:48.080]  and there's
[56:48.080 --> 56:50.080]  I don't know whatever I had like 10,000 seeds of it
[56:50.080 --> 56:52.080]  or something and he was like sold
[56:52.080 --> 56:54.080]  he took that whole lot of those
[56:54.080 --> 56:56.080]  and took them to Southern China
[56:56.080 --> 56:58.080]  and I never heard what happened with the Plum Bud
[56:58.080 --> 57:00.080]  I think 10% of them
[57:00.080 --> 57:02.080]  had got released at the beginning
[57:02.080 --> 57:04.080]  that were sold in town
[57:04.080 --> 57:06.080]  and then
[57:06.080 --> 57:08.080]  through a shop downtown
[57:08.800 --> 57:10.800]  and then
[57:10.800 --> 57:12.800]  90% that I was
[57:12.800 --> 57:14.800]  sitting on after I had sold the first 10
[57:14.800 --> 57:16.800]  that's when my friend came by and bought them all
[57:16.800 --> 57:18.800]  so the ones that
[57:18.800 --> 57:20.800]  I kept working were the Sweet Tooth
[57:20.800 --> 57:22.800]  and Shishkaberry which not coincidentally
[57:22.800 --> 57:24.800]  were also the biggest yielding
[57:24.800 --> 57:26.800]  ones of those four
[57:26.800 --> 57:28.800]  and the
[57:28.800 --> 57:30.800]  at the time especially I used to dream
[57:30.800 --> 57:32.800]  of the time when the tasty stuff
[57:32.800 --> 57:34.800]  would take precedence over
[57:34.800 --> 57:36.800]  this you know
[57:37.520 --> 57:39.520]  straight up bag of peel yield
[57:39.520 --> 57:41.520]  conundrum which is what people were
[57:41.520 --> 57:43.520]  looking for if you had a seed company
[57:43.520 --> 57:45.520]  back then
[57:45.520 --> 57:47.520]  like mid 90's to early 2000's
[57:47.520 --> 57:49.520]  when I did at least you'd have
[57:49.520 --> 57:51.520]  80% or
[57:51.520 --> 57:53.520]  more of your sales would be
[57:53.520 --> 57:55.520]  of your best yielding stuff
[57:55.520 --> 57:57.520]  you know it was really
[57:57.520 --> 57:59.520]  all people cared
[57:59.520 --> 58:01.520]  they would say oh those are really prettier
[58:01.520 --> 58:03.520]  yeah that's really tastier that's really
[58:03.520 --> 58:05.520]  strong and a few heady growers
[58:06.240 --> 58:08.240]  would opt for those but you couldn't
[58:08.240 --> 58:10.240]  justify
[58:10.240 --> 58:12.240]  from a business point of view
[58:12.240 --> 58:14.240]  devoting a lot of space to those
[58:14.240 --> 58:16.240]  you know even when you'd find
[58:16.240 --> 58:18.240]  those selections
[58:18.240 --> 58:20.240]  you'd be like oh my god I'm going to
[58:20.240 --> 58:22.240]  keep growing that for myself
[58:22.240 --> 58:24.240]  on the side but I'm going to breed with this one
[58:24.240 --> 58:26.240]  because people are going to kill me if it's not
[58:26.240 --> 58:28.240]  you know a solid big top
[58:28.240 --> 58:30.240]  you know they don't want these little
[58:30.240 --> 58:32.240]  tops yet eventually they'll be
[58:32.240 --> 58:34.240]  okay with the little ones with lots of flavor
[58:34.960 --> 58:36.960]  but overall it had to meet a certain
[58:36.960 --> 58:38.960]  weight standard so
[58:38.960 --> 58:40.960]  you know the seeds were popular
[58:40.960 --> 58:42.960]  because they were consistent
[58:42.960 --> 58:44.960]  for what people were looking for
[58:44.960 --> 58:46.960]  which was an easy to grow
[58:46.960 --> 58:48.960]  decent smoke I won't say
[58:48.960 --> 58:50.960]  the strongest ones but many of the
[58:50.960 --> 58:52.960]  sweet tooth generations got to be
[58:52.960 --> 58:54.960]  really sweet so that was
[58:54.960 --> 58:56.960]  nice and I really love
[58:56.960 --> 58:58.960]  to this day
[58:58.960 --> 59:00.960]  still the sweetest pot I know
[59:00.960 --> 59:02.960]  is good sweet tooth selections
[59:03.680 --> 59:05.680]  I love it but I don't see
[59:05.680 --> 59:07.680]  too many and because I'm not
[59:07.680 --> 59:09.680]  growing in North America
[59:09.680 --> 59:11.680]  like a real garden with
[59:11.680 --> 59:13.680]  a bedroom and a collection I'm just
[59:13.680 --> 59:15.680]  putting a few plants out that are pretty random
[59:15.680 --> 59:17.680]  just whatever friends happen to
[59:17.680 --> 59:19.680]  give me in the spring I pop out
[59:19.680 --> 59:21.680]  and
[59:21.680 --> 59:23.680]  you know it's frustrating when you've
[59:23.680 --> 59:25.680]  got a massive library of plants
[59:25.680 --> 59:27.680]  close to you but it's on another continent
[59:27.680 --> 59:29.680]  you can't just go and flower them all
[59:29.680 --> 59:31.680]  out at will
[59:32.400 --> 59:34.400]  it's a bit of a bite
[59:34.400 --> 59:36.400]  but it's cool
[59:36.400 --> 59:38.400]  Hey guys I apologize
[59:38.400 --> 59:40.400]  if I can interrupt
[59:40.400 --> 59:42.400]  I've got to run I've got some family visiting
[59:42.400 --> 59:44.400]  any moment now so things are going to get pretty
[59:44.400 --> 59:46.400]  disruptive on my end
[59:46.400 --> 59:48.400]  Well really nice meeting you man
[59:48.400 --> 59:50.400]  No mine
[59:50.400 --> 59:52.400]  It was my pleasure Peter
[59:52.400 --> 59:54.400]  I appreciate the invite
[59:54.400 --> 59:56.400]  We'll bring you back
[59:56.400 --> 59:58.400]  Steve and Kevin you guys are real heavy hitters
[59:58.400 --> 01:00:00.400]  legends in the industry so I couldn't
[01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:03.120]  I couldn't resist at least meeting you
[01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:05.120]  so I've got your contact
[01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:07.120]  information so Steve I'm interested
[01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:09.120]  in the library experiment in Columbia
[01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:11.120]  and Kevin I'm interested in visiting
[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:13.120]  your summer home on the coast in Maine
[01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:15.120]  when you buy it
[01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:17.120]  Have fun with the family
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:19.120]  Alright see you Ryan
[01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:21.120]  See you Peter thanks guys
[01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:29.120]  Justin Cash asked about
[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:31.840]  I'm finally going to ask it
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:33.840]  Can we get Kevin to update
[01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:35.840]  on the sour skunk strain
[01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:37.840]  Oh people
[01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:39.840]  Did you ever get that question?
[01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:41.840]  I get it every time
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:43.840]  What I did is
[01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:45.840]  By the way
[01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:47.840]  I think we've answered this
[01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:49.840]  question about 10 times
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:51.840]  in previous episodes
[01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:53.840]  but anyway go ahead
[01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:55.840]  Yeah no what happened was
[01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:57.840]  I got really ill a couple years back
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:00.560]  I died in the hospital I was in a coma for a minute
[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:02.560]  and
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:04.560]  when I got out of the ICU and went back
[01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:06.560]  to my life I just
[01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:08.560]  didn't have any energy
[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:10.560]  It took a while to get back to normal
[01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:12.560]  so I had to let the project sit
[01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:14.560]  and then we ended up losing the old
[01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:16.560]  facility due to zoning changes
[01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:18.560]  and so I lost my
[01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:20.560]  facility that I was going to do all the R&D
[01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:22.560]  at and so I lose probably
[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:24.560]  8-10 months from illness
[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:26.560]  and then I get fucked from zoning
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:29.280]  and we put in a
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:31.280]  new facility but we tied it into a larger
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:33.280]  company to stabilize
[01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:35.280]  the operation
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:37.280]  and I just didn't have the space
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:39.280]  of the ability to be able to go through the
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:41.280]  populations and so what I did is I licensed
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:43.280]  them over to another group
[01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:45.280]  and over the next
[01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:47.280]  couple years it's already beginning where we're starting
[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:49.280]  to go through the forms and opening up
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:51.280]  the plants themselves
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:53.280]  we can kind of take a look at a bigger population
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:55.280]  level and that's what's going on
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000]  I held all the stock, I kept all the pieces
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000]  I just realized that
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000]  I had my window closed
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000]  and I didn't expect to get sick, it was sudden
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000]  and one day I was fine and the next day I was
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000]  getting rushed to the hospital for emergency surgery
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  and there you go
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000]  so I kind of was a little above my
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000]  control but all the
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000]  materials still there, all the seed stock I
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000]  acquired, all the old stock from
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000]  the 80's that I put together
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000]  all of that's still present but in order to do
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000]  a good job you need big populations
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:26.720]  you need big populations to sift outliers
[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:28.720]  every now and then you can pull something
[01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:30.720]  wonderful out of a small selection
[01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:32.720]  but man if you can take a look at
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:34.720]  a bigger population it's nice
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:36.720]  I took a look the other day
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:38.720]  two or three months ago
[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:40.720]  at the Royal and the GMO
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:42.720]  so the Royal, the original Royal mom
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:44.720]  and the GMO cut
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:46.720]  and I had shared them with
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:48.720]  a group that has massive
[01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:50.720]  research facility potential
[01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:52.720]  and I got to see thousands
[01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:55.440]  of different plants
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:57.440]  and I had the same exact
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:59.440]  plant selfed and opened
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:01.440]  up into population form so I could
[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:03.440]  see the distribution
[01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:05.440]  of the traits within the population
[01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:07.440]  and it was incredible because it
[01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:09.440]  lets you really start to see the picture
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:11.440]  and that's the only way to do this
[01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:13.440]  correctly is to open these populations
[01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:15.440]  up. The thing with the skunk was
[01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:17.440]  that I love the smell of skunk piss herb
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:19.440]  but that wasn't what I was seeking
[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:21.440]  primarily, that was one of the things
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:24.160]  that took me back to my childhood
[01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:26.160]  in New England because we were moving so much
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:28.160]  Colombian stock through the neighborhood
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:30.160]  and because my neighborhood
[01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:32.160]  was real crime
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:34.160]  it means that there was real
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:36.160]  weight moving through so
[01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:38.160]  you were seeing it coming in in huge
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:40.160]  quantities and the people that were moving
[01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:42.160]  all of it were all into weed
[01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:44.160]  heavily too so they would always sift out
[01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:46.160]  the best shit all the time
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:48.160]  and a lot of that stock
[01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:50.160]  from Colombia coming from Panama
[01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:52.880]  coming from Afghanistan
[01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:54.880]  Central America
[01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:56.880]  India, it would come in seasonally
[01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:58.880]  once it was harvested and it made its way
[01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:00.880]  into the US
[01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:02.880]  and there was just those, that's like
[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:04.880]  my youth and what I wanted
[01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:06.880]  was I wanted to go back to my youth
[01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:08.880]  just to enjoy things
[01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:10.880]  from that time period
[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:12.880]  and I was able to collect a lot of stock
[01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:14.880]  from the 80s
[01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:16.880]  and start to mine into it
[01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:18.880]  and it was just a beautiful experience
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:21.600]  once I got ill I was done
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:23.600]  I'm glad I had insurance
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:25.600]  and even with full insurance it still cost me
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:27.600]  like 70, 80 grand on top of the
[01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:29.600]  couple hundred grand it cost to be in the ICU
[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:31.600]  go in a coma
[01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:33.600]  while you're sleeping they're still ripping all the money
[01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:35.600]  out of your pocket
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:37.600]  and so it's just chilling
[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:39.600]  so it's not going anywhere, all the material's held
[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:41.600]  everything is in vitro, stored, scrubbed
[01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:43.600]  so we've gotten all the pathogens out
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:45.600]  the amount of pathogenic
[01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:47.600]  baggage on most of the plants you see
[01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:50.320]  it's rare that you see anything
[01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:52.320]  that doesn't have some type of weight on it
[01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:54.320]  I was telling someone
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:56.320]  I used to plant regular 50 count cube
[01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:58.320]  clones, so the clone would be 3-4 inches
[01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:00.320]  tall, 50 cell size
[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:02.320]  so you had inch and a half
[01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:04.320]  by inch and a half
[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:06.320]  root ball
[01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:08.320]  I would plant it into soil-less
[01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:10.320]  and we would knock in out of 16
[01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:12.320]  plants planted that way with like
[01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:14.320]  24 hours veg
[01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:16.320]  we would knock in 2.5 pounds of light
[01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:19.040]  off a 16 square foot grid
[01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:21.040]  in the late 90s
[01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:23.040]  and so
[01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:25.040]  I had a collection
[01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:27.040]  of plants that could throw weight like that
[01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:29.040]  and was good grass
[01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:31.040]  and we saw these changes in yield
[01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:33.040]  potential decrease over time
[01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:35.040]  and I just realized that there was stuff we didn't
[01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:37.040]  see and once we started really being able to do
[01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:39.040]  virology tests we saw how much crap was
[01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:41.040]  weighed into our stock
[01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:43.040]  and so scrub everything up and now we can
[01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:45.040]  take a real look at it
[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:47.760]  and the people that do leaf pressing
[01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:49.760]  and
[01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:51.760]  like say data preservation
[01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:53.760]  of what a plant is supposed to look like
[01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:55.760]  for
[01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:57.760]  banking
[01:05:57.760 --> 01:05:59.760]  that's where you really want to take a look at what the plant
[01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:01.760]  really looks like because with
[01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:03.760]  all the viral issues
[01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:05.760]  it changes the leaf shape
[01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:07.760]  it changes the structure of the plant
[01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:09.760]  so it's all good
[01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:11.760]  I just had a window
[01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:13.760]  and I went at it and I collected and gathered
[01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:16.480]  and I built the project
[01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:18.480]  but then I got sick
[01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:20.480]  and we had a setback change
[01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:22.480]  the county changed the setbacks at my old facility
[01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:24.480]  and wiped out
[01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:26.480]  the whole facility
[01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:28.480]  so I had probably 25-26 people
[01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:30.480]  working there for me
[01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:32.480]  and we were about to fill
[01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:34.480]  the whole back with new ranges
[01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:36.480]  and it was going to be a really killer situation
[01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:38.480]  and then
[01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:40.480]  I had this killer dream of I had another operation
[01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:42.480]  that we were putting together that we were going to use
[01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:45.200]  and we were going to use old wonderland
[01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:47.200]  as a breeding facility but we were going to use it
[01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:49.200]  for other people
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:51.200]  so what we would do is we would allow the breeder
[01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:53.200]  to come in, the breeder could make
[01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:55.200]  the selections, the breeder would
[01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:57.200]  receive the credit, we would just do
[01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:59.200]  the production because I knew how
[01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:01.200]  many breeders I was working with that didn't have
[01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:03.200]  licenses because they didn't have the ability
[01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:05.200]  to acquire them. The amount of money it took
[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:07.200]  to get the real estate, the license
[01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:09.200]  all the stuff was just staggering
[01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:11.200]  staggering
[01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:13.920]  and so we wanted to be able to
[01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:15.920]  further the people we had worked with
[01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:17.920]  for years because we knew that
[01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:19.920]  the diversity is the only way you're going to have
[01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:21.920]  real success. I don't think anybody's
[01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:23.920]  smart enough on their own to cover the spectrum
[01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:25.920]  and I mean I meet some brilliant people
[01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:27.920]  Steve, one of them, you know
[01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:29.920]  you've been laying down stock forever
[01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:31.920]  but you
[01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:33.920]  know too you're only one guy, you can only go
[01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:35.920]  so far. No, that's why having
[01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:37.920]  satellite places is the key
[01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:39.920]  the satellite places is where you
[01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:42.640]  get to validate everything you think you're learning
[01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:44.640]  in your tea place, you know.
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:46.640]  Exactly.
[01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:48.640]  You can substantiate it.
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:50.640]  Well you're picking out different recesses
[01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:52.640]  like you said you find different groups
[01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:54.640]  within the population and when you
[01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:56.640]  start a hundred thousand of the same seed
[01:07:56.640 --> 01:07:58.640]  in ten different climates
[01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:00.640]  you're going to lean towards
[01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:02.640]  different ones potentially, right?
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:04.640]  Yep, and it's going to give you what you need
[01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:06.640]  you need it to work correctly
[01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:08.640]  It's a numbers game though, like you said
[01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:11.360]  numbers is a selection
[01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:13.360]  Yeah, and you know a good
[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:15.360]  breed package lets an individual who wants
[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:17.360]  to cultivate cannabis from a ten pack
[01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:19.360]  they can get some killer stock
[01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:21.360]  but that's not where you want
[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:23.360]  to build a line from
[01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:25.360]  you know, it'd help if you
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:27.360]  had a much bigger population
[01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:29.360]  The bigger the better for sure
[01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:31.360]  but I think the minimum
[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:33.360]  out of what I've talked to
[01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:35.360]  other breeders as well is that we seem
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:37.360]  to start seeing repetition
[01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:40.080]  after lots of 250
[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:42.080]  and that's when I found
[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:44.080]  like my sweet skunk was a
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:46.080]  recessive sativa
[01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:48.080]  coming out of the cross that was mostly
[01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:50.080]  looking like northern lights
[01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:52.080]  and it was like 2 out of 500
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:54.080]  the F1 I planted out 500
[01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:56.080]  seeds and I had 2
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:58.080]  that looked like haze
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:00.080]  and 490 that looked like
[01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:02.080]  hindicance and they were just like
[01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:04.080]  well Jesus, these are
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:06.080]  exactly what they mean by recessive
[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:08.800]  you just get a little throwback
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:10.800]  but other times I started stuff
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:12.800]  I would keep that ratio in mind
[01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:14.800]  and I always found that you saw
[01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:16.800]  the loosest recessive would show up
[01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:18.800]  on the 250th seed
[01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:20.800]  you know, so if you had 4
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:22.800]  of them from 1000
[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:24.800]  you'd start seeing, you'd still get to choose
[01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:26.800]  between them, it's better to have 1000
[01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:28.800]  than 250 but I think the minimum
[01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:30.800]  you need to look at to see the different
[01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:32.800]  expressions is at least 250
[01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:34.800]  you know
[01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:37.520]  even in work they've developed, I was talking
[01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:39.520]  to
[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:41.520]  Louis from
[01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:43.520]  ACE and we were talking about haze
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:45.520]  with the psychoactive
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:47.520]  component in high
[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:49.520]  and even though they've
[01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:51.520]  worked these lines so heavily, you only see
[01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:53.520]  it really pop out 1 in 100 plus
[01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:55.520]  so you really
[01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:57.520]  only get that and they're not even sure
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:09:59.520]  really what's the indicators for it
[01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:01.520]  you have to go through and smoke them
[01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:03.520]  and so you know, it's the same
[01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:06.240]  thing, you need big populations to hunt
[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:08.240]  the stuff that are outliers and then from there
[01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:10.240]  we can run it on clonal form
[01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:12.240]  but I ran that sweet skunk you had
[01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:14.240]  I had that and the grapefruit
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:16.240]  and then a couple years later
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:18.240]  I hooked up with Red from Legends
[01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:20.240]  and I was running
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:22.240]  the Legends
[01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:24.240]  ultimate indica which was your sweet
[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:26.240]  tooth male into their Ortega
[01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:28.240]  and they had an Ortega
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:30.240]  and that did really well
[01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:32.240]  I made that too actually
[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:34.960]  I got the Ortega
[01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:36.960]  clone from California
[01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:38.960]  to Switzerland
[01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:40.960]  and when I made sweet tooth 3
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:42.960]  and 4, the same
[01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:44.960]  father which was sweet tooth
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:46.960]  BX2P1
[01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:48.960]  that same father hit the Ortega
[01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:50.960]  at the same time as it was making
[01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:52.960]  sweet tooth 3, sweet tooth 4
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:54.960]  it was making the Louis at the same time
[01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:56.960]  yeah that was nice, that was beautiful
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:10:58.960]  I was running some
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:00.960]  it was chunky
[01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:03.680]  it was dense
[01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:05.680]  like a bag
[01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:07.680]  you get the half bag factor
[01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:09.680]  right Ruth?
[01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:11.680]  good color
[01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:13.680]  they were nice, they were good commercial
[01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:15.680]  that was mainly what I
[01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:17.680]  had to strive for
[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:19.680]  how quality can I go
[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:21.680]  but still be commercial
[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:23.680]  if it wasn't a commercial strain
[01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:25.680]  nobody would grow it
[01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:27.680]  it was a shortage of cannabis then
[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:29.680]  so if you could get cannabis
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:32.400]  they were getting in trouble
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:34.400]  if you got caught with it
[01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:36.400]  they wanted to get their yields
[01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:38.400]  and you needed the money for the lawyer
[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:40.400]  you had to make enough cash
[01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:42.400]  how did you like that sweet skunk?
[01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:44.400]  how did you like the sweet skunk clone?
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:46.400]  I liked it, it was nice
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:48.400]  I laughed because it had that explosive stretch
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:50.400]  it opened up tall
[01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:52.400]  it opened up
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:54.400]  it was a beautiful product
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:56.400]  the grapefruit was interesting
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:58.400]  because it was one of the first real citrusy varieties
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:01.120]  same thing, it had incredible yield potential
[01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:03.120]  so we were running
[01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:05.120]  an indoor operation
[01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:07.120]  so we would just make them back
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:09.120]  good
[01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:11.120]  I lost all that stuff in raids
[01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:13.120]  well you have to get them back sometime
[01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:15.120]  the sweet skunk, what I would tell people
[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:17.120]  if you want to see a green
[01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:19.120]  which is how I recommend it indoors
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:21.120]  is root the cuttings
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:23.120]  on 12 hours
[01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:25.120]  so that they're
[01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:27.120]  already thinking it's time
[01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:29.840]  to flower while they're rooting
[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:31.840]  they root easy
[01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:33.840]  and then when they grow
[01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:35.840]  I was putting 36
[01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:37.840]  6x6
[01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:39.840]  under 1000 watt air cooled
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:41.840]  at the time
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:43.840]  and running
[01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:45.840]  just colas
[01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:47.840]  they were in a system where the roots ran down deep
[01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:49.840]  as well
[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:51.840]  like an aquaponic, aeroponic scenario
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:53.840]  but they were
[01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:55.840]  that spacing
[01:12:56.560 --> 01:12:58.560]  they were like bats
[01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:00.560]  no branches
[01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:02.560]  if you ever saw one making a branch near the beginning
[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:04.560]  you would just pull it off
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:06.560]  and they would just stretch
[01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:08.560]  like you know
[01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:10.560]  they triple in size
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:12.560]  so they would just turn into
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:14.560]  60 gram bats
[01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:16.560]  just like rows of bats
[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:18.560]  they were gorgeous
[01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:20.560]  and the smell and taste of those
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:22.560]  is still one of my favorites
[01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:24.560]  that's still my go to
[01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:27.280]  I was watching a video
[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:29.280]  of a guy on television
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:31.280]  and he was saying he gave you a Congo cut
[01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:33.280]  and wanted to see how you liked that Congo
[01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:35.280]  oh man I love the Congo
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:37.280]  I have a killer
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:39.280]  I'll have to send you a picture
[01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:41.280]  I got a killer one in my yard right now
[01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:43.280]  I got the cut from
[01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:45.280]  I was up in Canada
[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:47.280]  and Marcus Richardson
[01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:49.280]  the bubble man
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:51.280]  brought me a nub of it
[01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:53.280]  and I smoked it in the morning
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000]  and I was like I'm electric shit
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000]  and then Tara
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000]  brings me the plant
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000]  and says here's a copy of it for you
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000]  and so I get a
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000]  message from Robbie
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000]  saying hey if you want
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000]  you can share this plant out
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000]  and put it into the public
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000]  and so what I did is I brought it to the Regen conferences
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000]  and I took a whole
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000]  bunch of plants
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000]  and I just cut them into bare roots
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000]  and then I'd wrap them so this way I could give out
[01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:24.720]  and I just loaded people up with it
[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:26.720]  because it's a beautiful plant
[01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:28.720]  it finishes mid November here
[01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:30.720]  in Humboldt County
[01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:32.720]  and it couldn't be any nicer
[01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:34.720]  of a chassis for such a cerebral variety
[01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:36.720]  just really
[01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:38.720]  killer cannabis in every aspect
[01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:40.720]  and people need to have it
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:42.720]  in their life
[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:44.720]  it's very distinct
[01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:46.720]  and it's such a nice break from all the
[01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:48.720]  you know cush by cush
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:50.720]  everything
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:53.440]  it's such a refreshing like
[01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:55.440]  oh this is different
[01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:57.440]  this isn't related to everything else I've been smoking
[01:14:57.440 --> 01:14:59.440]  no no it's beautiful
[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:01.440]  and the thing was
[01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:03.440]  it's got a track
[01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:05.440]  meaning that he knows where it came from
[01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:07.440]  originally
[01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:09.440]  and that's something
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:11.440]  that I personally love
[01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:13.440]  I like to see things that were handled
[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:15.440]  and passed through time
[01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:17.440]  I know the guy that gave it to him actually
[01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:19.440]  do you?
[01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:22.160]  Robbie actually just made
[01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:24.160]  some S1's with it
[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:26.160]  oh did he?
[01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:28.160]  yeah he's never done that before
[01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:30.160]  he's taken a four-whip foray
[01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:32.160]  into a few beans there
[01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:34.160]  that'd be interesting
[01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:36.160]  I've never seen
[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:38.160]  something so cerebral
[01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:40.160]  throw yield like that
[01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:42.160]  the flower density is incredible
[01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:44.160]  the body of it is beautiful
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:46.160]  and up on my hill
[01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:48.160]  it's really windy
[01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:50.880]  he absolutely took that heavy wind
[01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:52.880]  took the fall rains
[01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:54.880]  not a single problem
[01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:56.880]  not a single drop of rot
[01:15:56.880 --> 01:15:58.880]  just beautiful
[01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:00.880]  I jarred it all up and smoked Congo all winter
[01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:02.880]  and then I just grew another beauty
[01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:04.880]  in the yard this year
[01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:06.880]  so I can have another couple pounds of it
[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:08.880]  for the head
[01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:10.880]  oh it's killer
[01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:12.880]  yeah no he did a beautiful job
[01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:14.880]  and then when we did the regen in Humboldt
[01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:16.880]  we passed him out
[01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:19.600]  and it screwed us up
[01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:21.600]  because it cut all the travel
[01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:23.600]  and cut all the other conventions
[01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:25.600]  so you're not really
[01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:27.600]  for a minute we're all kind of in pause
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:29.600]  but once we go back to normality again
[01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:31.600]  when I have another California convention
[01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:33.600]  I'll go and mom up another copy
[01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:35.600]  of it and cut it into slips
[01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:37.600]  and then wrap them
[01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:39.600]  and then I can bring it and give it away
[01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:41.600]  so that you have it in the population
[01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:43.600]  yeah when you get it out there
[01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:45.600]  that's how it lasts
[01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:48.320]  you don't share it you lose it
[01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:50.320]  that's why the sweet skunk is around
[01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:52.320]  because I fell so hard in love with it
[01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:54.320]  when I first found it
[01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:56.320]  I said I want everybody to grow this
[01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:58.320]  because I want to see this weed everywhere
[01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:00.320]  and I don't want to ever lose it
[01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:02.320]  and so to this day
[01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:04.320]  I can get a jar of sweet skunk
[01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:06.320]  or a few clones
[01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:08.320]  because I know so many people that still grow it
[01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:10.320]  because I told everybody I gave it to
[01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:12.320]  give it to more people
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:14.320]  make sure this gets out there
[01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:17.040]  but sometimes those
[01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:19.040]  sterols I had in the 90s
[01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:21.040]  that was like 95
[01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:23.040]  it was really early
[01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:25.040]  and I still was like I better not share these
[01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:27.040]  these are special I need to do something with those
[01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:29.040]  but then of course
[01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:31.040]  you lose them over time
[01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:33.040]  and you're very mad
[01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:35.040]  oh this stuff
[01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:37.040]  and the problem is
[01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:39.040]  too is that
[01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:41.040]  in the past when we were all collecting
[01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:43.040]  cannabis and you were moving stuff and sharing it
[01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:45.760]  there was a really good collection
[01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:47.760]  of beautiful things
[01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:49.760]  back then that was diverse
[01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:51.760]  and I don't think people understood
[01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:53.760]  that it was this magic moment
[01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:55.760]  where it was all going to start to become really pipelined
[01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:57.760]  and you didn't
[01:17:57.760 --> 01:17:59.760]  understand the value of preservation
[01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:01.760]  and so for me I was always holding genetics
[01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:03.760]  but because of what I did
[01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:05.760]  it always put me into
[01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:07.760]  legal issues
[01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:09.760]  and so every time you had a raid at a location
[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:11.760]  if they hit the mother op
[01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:14.480]  we had armed robberies
[01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:16.480]  and it's gone and then other people
[01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:18.480]  that you'd given it to you're like hey I need to get a copy back
[01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:20.480]  and they're like oh I get rid of it
[01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:22.480]  thinking you'd have a copy
[01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:24.480]  and I'm just like oh god no
[01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:26.480]  and we had cannabis that was just so distinct
[01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:28.480]  and so
[01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:30.480]  I can think of some that slipped through the fingers
[01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:32.480]  and it just kills me now
[01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:34.480]  oh my god
[01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:36.480]  and I look at all this stuff and I go
[01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:38.480]  there's a lot of beautiful cannabis today
[01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:40.480]  there's more to choose from
[01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:43.200]  than everybody overall
[01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:45.200]  so it's a total thing to be celebrated
[01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:47.200]  and it's to be expected
[01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:49.200]  and even if you look at ancient
[01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:51.200]  official collections like the Vavilov Institute's
[01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:53.200]  collection
[01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:55.200]  most of that was outdated and dying off
[01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:57.200]  too you know
[01:18:57.200 --> 01:18:59.200]  if you couldn't go and refresh the stock
[01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:01.200]  they were losing it
[01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:03.200]  and
[01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:05.200]  biodiversity
[01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:07.200]  in all species is an issue
[01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:09.200]  you've lost a lot
[01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:13.200]  I was talking to
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:15.200]  Jordan who's
[01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:17.200]  a shapeshifter
[01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:19.200]  he bred Freak Show
[01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:21.200]  and Nat Pennington
[01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:23.200]  I actually got to
[01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:25.200]  finish editing the video but
[01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:27.200]  he was talking about stuff that
[01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:29.200]  like a long time so
[01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:31.200]  his like tragic story was
[01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:33.200]  he had a mason jar full of seeds
[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:35.200]  in like the 70s that he like
[01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:37.200]  put in the woods and then went to get it
[01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:39.200]  and like the whole thing had rusted
[01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:41.920]  and he lost all those seeds
[01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:43.920]  but he was talking about stuff that smelled
[01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:45.920]  super chocolatey
[01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:47.920]  like back in the 60s
[01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:49.920]  and stuff
[01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:51.920]  I don't know what you guys have come across
[01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:53.920]  in the chocolatey smells
[01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:55.920]  Thai
[01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:57.920]  that's what
[01:19:57.920 --> 01:19:59.920]  he was talking about
[01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:01.920]  you know and
[01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:03.920]  like I said I was lucky
[01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:05.920]  in some ways
[01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:07.920]  because you're surrounded by
[01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:10.640]  African criminals
[01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:12.640]  we would always have some of the most
[01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:14.640]  incredible cannabis coming through the region
[01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:16.640]  because it was being brought in and then moved
[01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:18.640]  through New England and up into New York
[01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:20.640]  Boston out of the ports in Rhode Island
[01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:22.640]  and every
[01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:24.640]  September pretty much right when
[01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:26.640]  school started
[01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:28.640]  it was funny because that was when the good Thai
[01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:30.640]  came in and I'd always go to high school
[01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:32.640]  sparked out of my mind
[01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:34.640]  on Thai so the first couple weeks of high school
[01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:36.640]  it was almost like I was unable to function
[01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:39.360]  but it's where I had the best chocolate
[01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:41.360]  flavors and I really haven't
[01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:43.360]  seen the same
[01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:45.360]  depth of chocolate
[01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:47.360]  I see some of the chocolates
[01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:49.360]  in some of the kushes
[01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:51.360]  like the more coffee earth
[01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:53.360]  chocolate but not that
[01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:55.360]  deep profound chocolate
[01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:57.360]  where it fills your mouth
[01:20:57.360 --> 01:20:59.360]  with like the bitter
[01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:01.360]  almost like cacao
[01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:03.360]  when you have cacao fresh
[01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:05.360]  it has a different
[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:08.080]  what we associate with chocolate
[01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:10.080]  but there's a purity to it
[01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:12.080]  now that I know what chocolate
[01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:14.080]  really is
[01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:16.080]  as a kid I was like ooh it's chocolatey but really
[01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:18.080]  it's more like cacao
[01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:20.080]  and oh my god it was good
[01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:22.080]  but I don't see that in
[01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:24.080]  it's true form anywhere
[01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:26.080]  and I haven't experienced
[01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:28.080]  that flavor in years
[01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:32.080]  I've only had two that turned out
[01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:34.080]  like that and one was
[01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:36.800]  as much down to the curing as the plant
[01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:38.800]  because the plant was not chocolatey at all
[01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:40.800]  freshly cured in the fall
[01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:42.800]  but by the next summer
[01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:44.800]  it had turned to
[01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:46.800]  chocolate completely
[01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:48.800]  and that was one where I'd seen
[01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:50.800]  that's when it first hit me
[01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:52.800]  that certain
[01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:54.800]  cannabis must have
[01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:56.800]  better shelf life than other cannabis
[01:21:56.800 --> 01:21:58.800]  some of it's better
[01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:00.800]  for aging than others like wines
[01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:02.800]  some of them are both aged and some of them aren't
[01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:05.520]  it was funny because
[01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:07.520]  I distinctly remember a friend
[01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:09.520]  shitting on that bud in the fall
[01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:11.520]  when he came in I had
[01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:13.520]  a few different buds and jars
[01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:15.520]  and everyone was like oh fuck this smells like shit
[01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:17.520]  and then he came back and I remember
[01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:19.520]  nobody liked that jar in the fall
[01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:21.520]  and then I'd stuck it away and then I'd pulled it out
[01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:23.520]  next summer when we were getting lower and lower
[01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:25.520]  and then everybody was like
[01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:27.520]  oh my god what's this jar it's like chocolate
[01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:29.520]  and it really had become
[01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:31.520]  from like poo to chocolate
[01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:34.240]  over the course of the curing time
[01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:36.240]  and that was not
[01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:38.240]  you know
[01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:40.240]  something you would have smelled in the living plant really
[01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:42.240]  but then out of
[01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:44.240]  many flow seed I grew
[01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:46.240]  one time there was one
[01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:48.240]  that was very recessive
[01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:50.240]  and small
[01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:52.240]  the smallest example there was maybe
[01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:54.240]  13 phenos in the flow
[01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:56.240]  and there was one that was the mother of one
[01:22:56.240 --> 01:22:58.240]  I called Rosebud
[01:22:58.240 --> 01:23:00.240]  I did a joint project series with Dan
[01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:02.960]  and it was
[01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:04.960]  the Rosebud I put
[01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:06.960]  for yield I put Vismal
[01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:08.960]  because I had to reduce this one
[01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:10.960]  it tasted
[01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:12.960]  like Nepalese hash
[01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:14.960]  because of how chocolatey it tasted
[01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:16.960]  like it had a distinctive
[01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:18.960]  I remember actually
[01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:20.960]  with Richardson there in Bubbleman
[01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:22.960]  he was in a
[01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:24.960]  grocery store in Switzerland
[01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:26.960]  when he came back to the car and I was
[01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:28.960]  in the car smoking a little
[01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:31.680]  joint of this flow mother
[01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:33.680]  that was the de-seeded Rosebud
[01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:35.680]  and I was smoking it and he's
[01:23:35.680 --> 01:23:37.680]  in the car and he says
[01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:39.680]  are you smoking Nepalese hash that smells bad
[01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:41.680]  and I said no it's weed
[01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:43.680]  and even then he didn't really smoke weed
[01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:45.680]  he was just smoking hash
[01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:47.680]  and he was like I want to hit it
[01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:49.680]  it just had that chocolatey taste
[01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:51.680]  that you think of with Nepalese
[01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:53.680]  totally chocolate flavor
[01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:55.680]  those were the only two grasses I had
[01:23:55.680 --> 01:23:57.680]  that were like distinctly
[01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:00.400]  I had other ones that had chocolate in the name
[01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:02.400]  but I never got the chocolate
[01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:04.400]  even the chocolate pies I saw
[01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:06.400]  you could see a bit of the color
[01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:08.400]  there was a little tint almost
[01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:10.400]  to it as the bud
[01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:12.400]  but it was like no I didn't hit it
[01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:14.400]  but I didn't try it from Thailand
[01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:16.400]  that was just something grown
[01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:18.400]  in Holland or Canada or somewhere
[01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:20.400]  but interesting
[01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:22.400]  it's something to work on
[01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:24.400]  because everybody loves chocolate
[01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:26.400]  or almost everybody loves chocolate
[01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:29.120]  but overall it's pretty popular
[01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:31.120]  yeah no a rich beautiful
[01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:33.120]  beautiful encompassing
[01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:35.120]  it grabs you
[01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:37.120]  but it's the same thing I have to go back to
[01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:39.120]  you know late 80s
[01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:41.120]  shit mid 80s
[01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:43.120]  to be able to say that was the last time
[01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:45.120]  but I was fortunate
[01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:47.120]  but the thing was the people that I grew up with
[01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:49.120]  my family and all the people I was around
[01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:51.120]  were large traffickers
[01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:53.120]  and they were older and very experienced
[01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:55.120]  and so whenever anything came in
[01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:57.840]  that was incredible
[01:24:57.840 --> 01:24:59.840]  they'd come over your house and say
[01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:01.840]  hey this batch is real
[01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:03.840]  this is the real one
[01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:05.840]  and so that's when you'd break out your money
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:07.840]  and buy the real shit and hold it
[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:09.840]  and I remember everyone had these fish and tackle boxes
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:11.840]  you know the Diyahwa fish and tackle boxes
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:13.840]  and in the fish and tackle box
[01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:15.840]  would be all the baby food jars
[01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:17.840]  of all the stuff that had been coming in
[01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:19.840]  that was killer
[01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:21.840]  and it was the same thing
[01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:23.840]  they'd say this one here is like a year old
[01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:26.560]  and then there's others that degraded quick
[01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:28.560]  and so it's
[01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:30.560]  some things hold well and some things don't
[01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:32.560]  whoever makes the selection
[01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:34.560]  you know they have to have a good palate
[01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:36.560]  and if you got somebody
[01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:38.560]  who has a good palate and knows good cannabis
[01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:40.560]  through big batches they can find the quality
[01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:42.560]  but the diversity
[01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:44.560]  kind of backed up heavily after we
[01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:46.560]  went into the drug wars
[01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:48.560]  the drug wars really really cut back
[01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:50.560]  on the quantity
[01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:52.560]  the last time I smelled heavy chocolate
[01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:55.280]  but I didn't smoke any
[01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:57.280]  would have been
[01:25:57.280 --> 01:25:59.280]  88
[01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:01.280]  and I was involved in a
[01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:03.280]  drug seizure I was in the coast guard
[01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:05.280]  I went in the coast guard for a number of years
[01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:07.280]  after I got in trouble and got locked up as a kid
[01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:09.280]  I went in the military
[01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:11.280]  when I got out of high school
[01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:13.280]  and I was doing construction
[01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:15.280]  underwater construction for the coast guard
[01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:17.280]  but I also used to get loaned out to the DEA
[01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:19.280]  and the DOJ to dive on drug boats
[01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:21.280]  and I went
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000]  and was on an operation where they had pulled in
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000]  some ships from Thailand
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000]  and it was 110 tons of herb
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000]  and when they cut open
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000]  the barge
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000]  the smell that came out of that
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000]  I was trying to explain it to somebody one day
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000]  I said you don't know what herb smells like
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000]  until there's 110 tons of it in a barge
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000]  it was just
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000]  the thickest perfume
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000]  that filled you
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000]  and I didn't get to smoke any of the shit
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000]  because it was all armed guards everywhere
[01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:52.720]  that's some good grass
[01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:54.720]  I don't know if the flavor was chocolatey
[01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:56.720]  but the smell was like freshly
[01:26:56.720 --> 01:26:58.720]  ground chocolate
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:00.720]  just so aromatic
[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:02.720]  I think of it as a secondary
[01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:04.720]  bouquet
[01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:06.720]  in wine you have a primary aroma
[01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:08.720]  and then a secondary bouquet
[01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:10.720]  that develops in the bottle
[01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:12.720]  and that's kind of like
[01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:14.720]  it's in this constant
[01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:16.720]  state of flux
[01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:18.720]  but it's what the curing is doing
[01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:21.440]  it's not just taking certain compounds
[01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:23.440]  and changing them into others
[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:25.440]  or oxidizing them
[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:27.440]  and they give off a different characteristic
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:29.440]  I think that's a
[01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:31.440]  curing compound
[01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:33.440]  it's really neat
[01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:35.440]  I would like to look into that further
[01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:37.440]  and come up with
[01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:39.440]  I think it would be great to have
[01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:41.440]  a good true chocolate
[01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:43.440]  because I love chocolate
[01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:45.440]  I'm not much of a candy eater
[01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:47.440]  but man I can knock back
[01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:50.160]  I think even higher people would buy it
[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:54.160]  they want to smoke it anyway
[01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:56.160]  just because it tastes good
[01:27:56.160 --> 01:27:58.160]  and it's less filling
[01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:00.160]  safer diabetics
[01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:04.160]  How about for both of you
[01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:06.160]  what's a cultivar where the cure
[01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:08.160]  just kind of changes it
[01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:10.160]  noticeably or significantly
[01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:16.160]  Let's see what really shined
[01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:18.880]  I think it's storage
[01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:20.880]  you know
[01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:22.880]  the issue is
[01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:24.880]  who cured it
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:26.880]  because
[01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:28.880]  the fact that you held it for time
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:30.880]  is important
[01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:32.880]  but what conditions
[01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:34.880]  and so I don't think that most people
[01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:36.880]  really hold stuff
[01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:38.880]  cool enough
[01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:40.880]  and so it's vaporizing
[01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:42.880]  inside the jar
[01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:44.880]  and as soon as you crack the jar
[01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:47.600]  Kevin hold on one second
[01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:49.600]  Gemma come here
[01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:51.600]  most amazing
[01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:53.600]  quick
[01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:55.600]  Gemma noticed I was low
[01:28:55.600 --> 01:28:57.600]  on my first beer
[01:28:57.600 --> 01:28:59.600]  so she just ran to the fridge
[01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:01.600]  and brought me another one
[01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:03.600]  Carry on
[01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:05.600]  it's like the dog that brings you the newspaper
[01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:11.600]  Curing is an art form just like growing
[01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:13.600]  look at nice Italian restaurants
[01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:16.320]  or even homes
[01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:18.320]  you have a stagionamento
[01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:20.320]  where they cure the cheese
[01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:22.320]  they'll have a cheese curing area
[01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:24.320]  those guys
[01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:26.320]  they get really good cheeses
[01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:28.320]  and they know how to hold on to them
[01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:30.320]  and they know how to present them
[01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:32.320]  to you so that they're as good as when they bought them
[01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:34.320]  or better
[01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:36.320]  but some of us would just have a moldy cheese
[01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:38.320]  in the fridge
[01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:40.320]  because we just rolled it in saran wrap
[01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:42.320]  and it didn't know any better
[01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:45.040]  and the curing of cannabis
[01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:47.040]  I hear so many people
[01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:49.040]  they can't stand the thought of something
[01:29:49.040 --> 01:29:51.040]  being more than 2 or 3 months old
[01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:53.040]  and they just howl
[01:29:53.040 --> 01:29:55.040]  if it's done well
[01:29:55.040 --> 01:29:57.040]  it can really be better in a year
[01:29:57.040 --> 01:29:59.040]  you know
[01:29:59.040 --> 01:30:01.040]  but if
[01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:03.040]  otherwise
[01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:05.040]  the sooner the better
[01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:07.040]  because it's already too dry
[01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:09.040]  when they get it
[01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:11.040]  it's got to have enough sponginess
[01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:13.760]  that it's still spongy when you open it
[01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:15.760]  in a year but not so spongy
[01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:17.760]  that it starts to make off odors
[01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:19.760]  and get real moldy
[01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:21.760]  yeah it breaks down because it's got too much moisture
[01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:23.760]  so you get too much by-products
[01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:25.760]  it's a fine line
[01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:27.760]  I'd say
[01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:29.760]  what I notice from just holding cannabis
[01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:31.760]  is stuff that has
[01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:33.760]  a lighter, wispier body
[01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:35.760]  with less oils
[01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:37.760]  doesn't hold up over time as well
[01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:39.760]  right
[01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:42.480]  yeah and stuff that has a higher wax content
[01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:44.480]  so stuff that is a little waxy
[01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:46.480]  or a little bit more lipid
[01:30:46.480 --> 01:30:48.480]  they seem to hold better
[01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:50.480]  over time and then the change
[01:30:50.480 --> 01:30:52.480]  is
[01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:54.480]  excellent in the subtleties that come out
[01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:56.480]  but the plant itself
[01:30:56.480 --> 01:30:58.480]  holds up
[01:30:58.480 --> 01:31:00.480]  the stuff that's more fragile
[01:31:00.480 --> 01:31:02.480]  the plant itself
[01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:04.480]  the green material
[01:31:04.480 --> 01:31:06.480]  seems to break down prematurely
[01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:08.480]  and so you don't end up capturing
[01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:11.200]  the experience you want from the cure
[01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:13.200]  because it wasn't meant to be
[01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:15.200]  held for time
[01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:17.200]  whereas stuff that was
[01:31:17.200 --> 01:31:19.200]  and I think it was just really
[01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:21.200]  it's a condition of selection
[01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:23.200]  because things that were in tropical climates
[01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:25.200]  were consumed because you couldn't hold it
[01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:27.200]  due to the humidity
[01:31:27.200 --> 01:31:29.200]  they had to dry out quick and be consumed
[01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:31.200]  because they would rot otherwise
[01:31:31.200 --> 01:31:33.200]  and I was really
[01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:35.200]  when I started first getting into doing hash work
[01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:37.200]  that would have been
[01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:39.920]  I was talking about with a lady who had lived in Morocco
[01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:41.920]  for a couple years
[01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:43.920]  and she was talking about
[01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:45.920]  the metal tins that they were
[01:31:45.920 --> 01:31:47.920]  burying in the sands of the resin
[01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:49.920]  and how they could open up
[01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:51.920]  the sand, pull out these metal
[01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:53.920]  containers that were sealed
[01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:55.920]  and pull out flawless resin
[01:31:55.920 --> 01:31:57.920]  with no deterioration
[01:31:57.920 --> 01:31:59.920]  and she was like it was all about
[01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:01.920]  getting the moisture
[01:32:01.920 --> 01:32:03.920]  perfect before you stored it
[01:32:03.920 --> 01:32:05.920]  and then putting it into a situation
[01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:08.640]  where you didn't have any real fluctuation
[01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:10.640]  in temperature or humidity
[01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:12.640]  that's the key too
[01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:14.640]  the constant temperature is everything
[01:32:14.640 --> 01:32:16.640]  yeah because the fluctuations
[01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:18.640]  make activity increase or decrease
[01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:20.640]  where the pressure
[01:32:20.640 --> 01:32:22.640]  pressure goes up and down in the can
[01:32:22.640 --> 01:32:24.640]  so that makes an air exchange
[01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:26.640]  no matter how tight the seal is
[01:32:26.640 --> 01:32:28.640]  the pressure is unavoidable
[01:32:28.640 --> 01:32:30.640]  something will squeak in
[01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:32.640]  so if it goes up and down
[01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:34.640]  there's constant air exchange
[01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:37.360]  micro oxygenation
[01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:39.360]  yeah the slightest level
[01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:41.360]  because we're so calibrated
[01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:43.360]  I remember when I went to a museum
[01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:45.360]  I was at the Boston Museum of Science
[01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:47.360]  and they had this big micrometer table
[01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:49.360]  and you could turn the micrometer
[01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:51.360]  and you could run your hand over it
[01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:53.360]  and we were calibrated
[01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:55.360]  to .003
[01:32:55.360 --> 01:32:57.360]  so you could feel
[01:32:57.360 --> 01:32:59.360]  .003 with your finger
[01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:01.360]  so if it was perfectly flat
[01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:03.360]  you would run your hand over it
[01:33:04.080 --> 01:33:06.080]  and if you got mic to .003
[01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:08.080]  you could feel that change
[01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:10.080]  and it
[01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:12.080]  the explanation was
[01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:14.080]  that humans are extremely calibrated
[01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:16.080]  that we just have to be
[01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:18.080]  exposed to something
[01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:20.080]  so that we can understand how calibrated
[01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:22.080]  and it made me realize
[01:33:22.080 --> 01:33:24.080]  that through olfactory ability
[01:33:24.080 --> 01:33:26.080]  the differences
[01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:28.080]  are so subtle
[01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:30.080]  I remember looking at an article on wine tasting
[01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:32.080]  and there was a man they called
[01:33:32.800 --> 01:33:34.800]  and he had a giant nose
[01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:36.800]  I mean he really did
[01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:38.800]  this thing looked like a beak
[01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:40.800]  like a toucan
[01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:42.800]  but he could stick the glass over his nose
[01:33:42.800 --> 01:33:44.800]  but he was like the most highly rated wine sniffer
[01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:46.800]  in the world
[01:33:46.800 --> 01:33:48.800]  and he had this massive nose
[01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:50.800]  and I was like wow
[01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:52.800]  he's got all that cubic inch of material inside
[01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:54.800]  to pick up all the nuances
[01:33:54.800 --> 01:33:56.800]  he had enough nose to be able to really gather
[01:33:56.800 --> 01:33:58.800]  scent
[01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:00.800]  and he would be able to pick up all the minute details
[01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:03.520]  so all these exquisite wineries
[01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:05.520]  would bring him in to do the smelling
[01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:07.520]  and the evaluation
[01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:09.520]  and the fine critique
[01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:11.520]  and some people
[01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:13.520]  just have better abilities than others
[01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:15.520]  but we're all pretty calibrated
[01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:17.520]  and so I don't think it takes a lot of change
[01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:19.520]  to go from good to great
[01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:21.520]  or from great to shit
[01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:23.520]  it's pretty quick
[01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:25.520]  you know what's funny with that sensory evaluation
[01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:27.520]  is everybody
[01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:29.520]  maybe even if we all had the same
[01:34:30.240 --> 01:34:32.240]  amount of receptors
[01:34:32.240 --> 01:34:34.240]  which I guy with the big nose will have more probably
[01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:36.240]  the important thing
[01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:38.240]  is people train
[01:34:38.240 --> 01:34:40.240]  their organoleptic memory
[01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:42.240]  as the French say
[01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:44.240]  memory organoleptic
[01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:46.240]  but that's where you remember
[01:34:46.240 --> 01:34:48.240]  the smell of various things
[01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:50.240]  so you can think of the smell
[01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:52.240]  of a fresh cut lawn
[01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:54.240]  it's in your memory organoleptic
[01:34:54.240 --> 01:34:56.240]  so if you can remember
[01:34:56.240 --> 01:34:58.240]  oh this
[01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:00.960]  I went to a cherry tasting and tried 30 different
[01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:02.960]  kinds of cherries
[01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:04.960]  do you know the difference between Bing and Lambert
[01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:06.960]  and Stella's and all the different ones
[01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:08.960]  so it's not just does it smell like cherry
[01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:10.960]  what cherry does it smell like
[01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:12.960]  it smells like yellow apple
[01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:14.960]  but Fuji or what
[01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:16.960]  Golden Delicious
[01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:18.960]  so everything's got it's own smell
[01:35:18.960 --> 01:35:20.960]  and the really strong
[01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:22.960]  tasters
[01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:24.960]  are the people that train
[01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:26.960]  that memory
[01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:29.680]  so you can think of the difference between those smells
[01:35:29.680 --> 01:35:31.680]  but it's a question of training your mind
[01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:33.680]  to recall them
[01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:35.680]  like that
[01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:37.680]  because you might smell like I know that smell
[01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:39.680]  I know that smell
[01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:41.680]  you gotta say that smells like
[01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:43.680]  Morello cherries
[01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:45.680]  you know what Morello cherries smell like
[01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:47.680]  and that's a different taste
[01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:49.680]  a little more sour
[01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:51.680]  so you get the smells and the tastes
[01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:53.680]  are obviously overlapping a lot
[01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:55.680]  too
[01:35:56.400 --> 01:35:58.400]  but I think the key to having a good memory
[01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:00.400]  more than having just the ability
[01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:02.400]  to distinguish
[01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:04.400]  is remembering the distinction
[01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:06.400]  and being able to bring the associations back
[01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:08.400]  on time
[01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:10.400]  you know
[01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:12.400]  I was talking to a master sommelier
[01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:14.400]  go ahead
[01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:16.400]  oh I was gonna say
[01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:18.400]  no no finish Steve
[01:36:18.400 --> 01:36:20.400]  I'm done
[01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:22.400]  oh I was talking to a master sommelier
[01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:24.400]  and so much of what they do
[01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:27.120]  it's not just to discern
[01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:29.120]  but it's the fact that they have to buy
[01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:31.120]  so many bottles of wine
[01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:33.120]  representing all these different regions
[01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:35.120]  and all these different
[01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:37.120]  subtleties so they can get that memory
[01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:39.120]  they're able to say
[01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:41.120]  this is what this is
[01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:43.120]  from here and then they log it
[01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:45.120]  and they try to record it mentally
[01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:47.120]  so that they can then
[01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:49.120]  consume something and then go
[01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:51.120]  oh that was from this region
[01:36:51.120 --> 01:36:53.120]  I can tell by these tones
[01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:55.840]  and it had an incredible brightness
[01:36:55.840 --> 01:36:57.840]  which means it would have come from this time period
[01:36:57.840 --> 01:36:59.840]  where the weather was such
[01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:01.840]  and it was really a matter of
[01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:03.840]  if you want to be a sommelier
[01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:05.840]  you have to have enough money
[01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:07.840]  to afford all the wine
[01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:09.840]  you have to buy
[01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:11.840]  to test
[01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:13.840]  yeah the expensive course is to become a master of wine
[01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:15.840]  that you end up having to buy a lot of wine
[01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:17.840]  I had a friend
[01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:19.840]  she did it and she
[01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:21.840]  to subsidize it she would make up a tasting group
[01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:24.560]  and her 10 closest wine snob
[01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:26.560]  friends like me that we would come over
[01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:28.560]  and subsidize
[01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:30.560]  she would organize it all
[01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:32.560]  but then divide the cost between the 11 of us
[01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:34.560]  drinking it or between the 10 of us
[01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:36.560]  so she got to drink everything for free
[01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:38.560]  on her course list
[01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:40.560]  by setting up a tasting
[01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:42.560]  for her friends
[01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:44.560]  so we would pay 40 bucks
[01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:46.560]  every other Monday night
[01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:48.560]  and go over to her place and try 14 different
[01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:50.560]  pinot wine
[01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:53.280]  I was really into it for a long time
[01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:55.280]  and I got a kick out of it
[01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:57.280]  it's funny
[01:37:57.280 --> 01:37:59.280]  it's just a parallel universe
[01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:01.280]  with cannabis
[01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:03.280]  but because it's been more accepted
[01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:05.280]  and open for so long
[01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:07.280]  there's more of a factor
[01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:09.280]  of terroir understood
[01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:11.280]  and also
[01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:13.280]  and even that
[01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:15.280]  when you say understood
[01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:17.280]  there's still disputes over it
[01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:19.280]  the biggest dispute I find
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000]  whether it's cannabis or wine
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000]  is whether or not terroir
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000]  includes the plant
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000]  you know the genetics
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000]  because some people think
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000]  that the genetics are part of the terroir
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000]  and I can kind of see where they're coming from
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000]  but not
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000]  because to me the terroir is everything
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000]  except the genetics
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000]  the genetics you can take out of the place
[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000]  you can take the genetics out of Burgundy
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000]  but you can't take Burgundy out of Burgundy
[01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000]  so the terroir
[01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:50.720]  stays
[01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:52.720]  you can take the genetics anywhere
[01:38:52.720 --> 01:38:54.720]  and to me that's the colored lens
[01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:56.720]  through which you view the terroir
[01:38:56.720 --> 01:38:58.720]  the clone you use
[01:38:58.720 --> 01:39:00.720]  to view the terroir
[01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:02.720]  whether you took the same clone
[01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:04.720]  and planted it in Humboldt
[01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:06.720]  in Sinaloa or in Jamaica
[01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:08.720]  different parts of Jamaica even
[01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:10.720]  you get a different tasting plant
[01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:12.720]  and it's really mainly down to the minerals
[01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:14.720]  of the soil
[01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:16.720]  or the water source
[01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:19.440]  the micro biology that lives
[01:39:19.440 --> 01:39:21.440]  it shows up and what you feed it is what's coming
[01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:23.440]  through it
[01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:25.440]  it's a varietal lens
[01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:27.440]  through which you view the terroir
[01:39:27.440 --> 01:39:29.440]  in my mind
[01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:31.440]  that's my side of that argument anyway
[01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:33.440]  I know
[01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:35.440]  there's some dispute in that factor
[01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:37.440]  but wine has a vintage on it
[01:39:37.440 --> 01:39:39.440]  too because in cannabis
[01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:41.440]  in most regions particularly North America
[01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:43.440]  you really just have one
[01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:45.440]  natural season crop a year
[01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:48.160]  whereas that might not apply on the equator so much
[01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:50.160]  but it would of certain plants
[01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:52.160]  like those nine month plants
[01:39:52.160 --> 01:39:54.160]  you get one vintage of those a year
[01:39:54.160 --> 01:39:56.160]  so for outdoor
[01:39:56.160 --> 01:39:58.160]  for flavor, for sensory
[01:39:58.160 --> 01:40:00.160]  vintage makes sense
[01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:02.160]  if it's grown on rockwool in a warehouse
[01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:04.160]  just a package date
[01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:06.160]  or whatever, harvest date, package date
[01:40:06.160 --> 01:40:08.160]  both would be better than one or the other
[01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:10.160]  but the
[01:40:10.160 --> 01:40:12.160]  season is less of an effect
[01:40:12.160 --> 01:40:14.160]  but you see big difference
[01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:16.880]  if it's a smoky year, a rainy year
[01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:18.880]  a sunny year
[01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:20.880]  if you're outside
[01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:22.880]  everything changes
[01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:24.880]  so you do verticals
[01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:26.880]  if you had your really well preserved
[01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:28.880]  rosin or hash or flowers
[01:40:28.880 --> 01:40:30.880]  you could have the same
[01:40:30.880 --> 01:40:32.880]  cutting from the last 10 years
[01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:34.880]  side by side
[01:40:34.880 --> 01:40:36.880]  that would be doing a vertical pasting of it
[01:40:36.880 --> 01:40:38.880]  I went to a fun one actually
[01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:40.880]  that this lady was putting on once
[01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:42.880]  and she had herbs
[01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:45.600]  and she had all these
[01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:47.600]  bongs set up
[01:40:47.600 --> 01:40:49.600]  in a row with all the different ones
[01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:51.600]  in a jar in front of it
[01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:53.600]  so you could just go down and grab a pinch
[01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:55.600]  in that bong and hit it
[01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:57.600]  and it was fun
[01:40:57.600 --> 01:40:59.600]  because a lot of people
[01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:01.600]  they hadn't really seen
[01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:03.600]  mass open smoking before
[01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:05.600]  it wasn't really legal or accepted yet
[01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:07.600]  she was blowing some minds that night
[01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:09.600]  it was pretty fun
[01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:11.600]  but it was fun to see
[01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:14.320]  what was the best year
[01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:16.320]  you know
[01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:18.320]  we see it here
[01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:20.320]  there's years that are just stellar
[01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:22.320]  and then there's years that are just stuck
[01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:24.320]  and this year
[01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:26.320]  this is going to be tough for anybody
[01:41:26.320 --> 01:41:28.320]  in the central valley because of the smoke
[01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:30.320]  it's still early
[01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:32.320]  so if you're not in a depth situation
[01:41:32.320 --> 01:41:34.320]  you shouldn't impart too much
[01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:36.320]  of an impact
[01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:38.320]  but if we go a little later in the season
[01:41:38.320 --> 01:41:40.320]  and you bring any of that smoke in
[01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:43.040]  it almost definitely leaves a trace
[01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:45.040]  you can't get rid of it
[01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:47.040]  it's like sulfur
[01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:49.040]  I've seen big tanks of wine
[01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:51.040]  I was doing a smaller production
[01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:53.040]  but I visited friends
[01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:55.040]  that worked at bigger ones
[01:41:55.040 --> 01:41:57.040]  and they had a fire
[01:41:57.040 --> 01:41:59.040]  they were fighting the fire
[01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:01.040]  at the edge of their vineyard
[01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:03.040]  at harvest time
[01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:05.040]  and the wines they made with that
[01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:07.040]  had such horrible smoke taste
[01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:09.040]  it didn't smell like a campfire
[01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:11.760]  it would smell like an ashtray full of beer
[01:42:11.760 --> 01:42:13.760]  it just had that horrible
[01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:15.760]  bar floor smell
[01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:17.760]  it was disgusting
[01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:19.760]  they had to
[01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:21.760]  just to make it into a salvaged drinkable wine
[01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:23.760]  they had a company come up
[01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:25.760]  from California with reverse osmosis
[01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:27.760]  machines to remove smoke paint
[01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:29.760]  you're not going to make an award winning wine
[01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:31.760]  out of that
[01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:33.760]  but at least it can go into your two buck truck
[01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:35.760]  kind of thing right
[01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:37.760]  they salvaged it somehow
[01:42:38.480 --> 01:42:40.480]  it was amazing how bad it smelled
[01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:42.480]  in the wine
[01:42:42.480 --> 01:42:44.480]  if the fire was a kilometer away
[01:42:44.480 --> 01:42:46.480]  the wine wasn't affected
[01:42:46.480 --> 01:42:48.480]  but if it was thick and pouring right into the vineyard
[01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:50.480]  they were really screwed
[01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:52.480]  so it didn't have
[01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:54.480]  a wood oven pizza
[01:42:54.480 --> 01:42:56.480]  amazing smoke
[01:42:56.480 --> 01:42:58.480]  it was like
[01:42:58.480 --> 01:43:00.480]  an ashtray
[01:43:00.480 --> 01:43:02.480]  from a party
[01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:04.480]  that was two days ago
[01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:06.480]  it was that gross
[01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:09.200]  you wouldn't expect it
[01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:11.200]  you told me it would smell like forest fire
[01:43:11.200 --> 01:43:13.200]  a bit more
[01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:15.200]  but if the smoke changes with the alcohol
[01:43:15.200 --> 01:43:17.200]  into that nasty ashtray smell
[01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:19.200]  not nice
[01:43:19.200 --> 01:43:21.200]  so by the way for all the people
[01:43:21.200 --> 01:43:23.200]  who are making fun of me
[01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:25.200]  for drinking Bud Light
[01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:27.200]  the reason
[01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:29.200]  I've never
[01:43:29.200 --> 01:43:31.200]  liked supporting Budweiser
[01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:33.200]  or big brands or drinking Bud Light
[01:43:33.200 --> 01:43:35.200]  but
[01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:37.920]  I remember when my wife asked me
[01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:39.920]  what beer I wanted from Costco
[01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:41.920]  I have no idea what Costco carries
[01:43:41.920 --> 01:43:43.920]  so I just tried to simplify
[01:43:43.920 --> 01:43:45.920]  and said Budweiser
[01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:47.920]  and ever since then
[01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:49.920]  every time she does a Costco run
[01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:51.920]  she comes back with the Bud Light
[01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:53.920]  so I've since switched
[01:43:53.920 --> 01:43:55.920]  to a Pinot Noir
[01:43:55.920 --> 01:43:57.920]  so anyway
[01:43:57.920 --> 01:43:59.920]  let's appreciate Gemma
[01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:01.920]  for at least making the effort
[01:44:01.920 --> 01:44:03.920]  of bringing me a beer
[01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:06.640]  but someone had a question
[01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:08.640]  a while ago about
[01:44:10.640 --> 01:44:12.640]  the correlation
[01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:14.640]  between inputs and flavor
[01:44:14.640 --> 01:44:16.640]  and can each of you talk about
[01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:18.640]  he was talking
[01:44:18.640 --> 01:44:20.640]  about what's the best
[01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:22.640]  alternative to guano
[01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:24.640]  but just in general
[01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:26.640]  things you've tried as inputs
[01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:28.640]  where you've then smoked it and been like
[01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:30.640]  I can definitely taste that
[01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:32.640]  and I should not be using that again
[01:44:34.640 --> 01:44:36.640]  the one thing that I've noticed
[01:44:36.640 --> 01:44:38.640]  because I've done a lot of testing
[01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:40.640]  on control
[01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:42.640]  and on experiment
[01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:44.640]  and we look at the information
[01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:46.640]  from the lab report
[01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:48.640]  and then we do blind comparison
[01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:50.640]  it's amazing
[01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:52.640]  but ultimately a good variety
[01:44:52.640 --> 01:44:54.640]  is a good variety
[01:44:54.640 --> 01:44:56.640]  and it gives you an effect
[01:44:56.640 --> 01:44:58.640]  so some things seem to impart flavors
[01:44:58.640 --> 01:45:00.640]  guano always put a little sweetness into it
[01:45:00.640 --> 01:45:02.640]  but the one thing I noticed
[01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:05.360]  and I noticed it through a blind test
[01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:07.360]  when I did the Amarok cup judging
[01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:09.360]  was that I noticed there was this really
[01:45:09.360 --> 01:45:11.360]  sweet rich flavor
[01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:13.360]  in a variety and I wrote in my notes
[01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:15.360]  but I remembered
[01:45:15.360 --> 01:45:17.360]  that tone
[01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:19.360]  and I started to pick out
[01:45:19.360 --> 01:45:21.360]  other samples that had that same
[01:45:21.360 --> 01:45:23.360]  back hint
[01:45:23.360 --> 01:45:25.360]  and I wrote it in my log
[01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:27.360]  and so I journal it all out
[01:45:27.360 --> 01:45:29.360]  and at the end of the event
[01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:31.360]  they give us all the data
[01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:34.080]  the inputs that was used
[01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:36.080]  on all of those samples that I put the note on
[01:45:36.080 --> 01:45:38.080]  and they all came from a compost
[01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:40.080]  company in Sonoma that used grape husk
[01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:42.080]  and so
[01:45:42.080 --> 01:45:44.080]  the grape husk for whatever reason
[01:45:44.080 --> 01:45:46.080]  added a level of sweetness
[01:45:46.080 --> 01:45:48.080]  that
[01:45:48.080 --> 01:45:50.080]  and it wasn't the same variety that I consumed
[01:45:50.080 --> 01:45:52.080]  and none of the cultivators
[01:45:52.080 --> 01:45:54.080]  it wasn't the same farm
[01:45:54.080 --> 01:45:56.080]  so multiple cultivators from multiple areas
[01:45:56.080 --> 01:45:58.080]  in Sonoma
[01:45:58.080 --> 01:46:00.080]  used that compost
[01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:02.800]  and it had a sweetness
[01:46:02.800 --> 01:46:04.800]  in the back that was delicate
[01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:06.800]  but it just added this richness to the smoke
[01:46:06.800 --> 01:46:08.800]  that was beautiful
[01:46:08.800 --> 01:46:10.800]  and I think that might be one of the only things
[01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:12.800]  that I can really say
[01:46:12.800 --> 01:46:14.800]  had a real impact
[01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:16.800]  above and beyond the norm
[01:46:16.800 --> 01:46:18.800]  where usually good well grown cannabis
[01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:20.800]  that's grown to fruition
[01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:22.800]  you're really catching the variety
[01:46:22.800 --> 01:46:24.800]  if the biology is working right
[01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:26.800]  it's delivering the nutrients
[01:46:26.800 --> 01:46:28.800]  the plant is steering the direction
[01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:31.520]  it's got enough diurnal swing
[01:46:31.520 --> 01:46:33.520]  you're going to get more intensity
[01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:35.520]  if you're having more wind
[01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:37.520]  you're going to get more wax
[01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:39.520]  which will hold the flavor a little better
[01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:41.520]  so the perception that the input
[01:46:41.520 --> 01:46:43.520]  made it happen was really the waxes
[01:46:43.520 --> 01:46:45.520]  are kind of holding it
[01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:47.520]  so it gets kind of confusing
[01:46:47.520 --> 01:46:49.520]  as to what's really making the impact
[01:46:49.520 --> 01:46:51.520]  but for years guano was
[01:46:51.520 --> 01:46:53.520]  what everyone associated Humboldt Pot with
[01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:55.520]  and then we really started depleting
[01:46:55.520 --> 01:46:57.520]  the guano supplies
[01:46:58.240 --> 01:47:00.240]  and then you see a change in the quality of guano
[01:47:00.240 --> 01:47:02.240]  where guano became basically guano sand
[01:47:02.240 --> 01:47:04.240]  so they started mining the sand
[01:47:04.240 --> 01:47:06.240]  that was under the guano deposits
[01:47:06.240 --> 01:47:08.240]  in the caves
[01:47:08.240 --> 01:47:10.240]  when I first got out to California
[01:47:10.240 --> 01:47:12.240]  in the 80s
[01:47:12.240 --> 01:47:14.240]  guano looked like almost graphite
[01:47:14.240 --> 01:47:16.240]  little bat turds
[01:47:16.240 --> 01:47:18.240]  it looked like graphite-y gray
[01:47:18.240 --> 01:47:20.240]  and it was soft and fluffy
[01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:22.240]  and that had this richness
[01:47:22.240 --> 01:47:24.240]  and flavor that was this beautiful sweetness
[01:47:24.240 --> 01:47:26.240]  and the only thing I saw
[01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:28.960]  but a lot of times when we check inputs
[01:47:28.960 --> 01:47:30.960]  most of it was the plant
[01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:32.960]  well grown
[01:47:32.960 --> 01:47:34.960]  and so I don't know
[01:47:34.960 --> 01:47:36.960]  because we haven't done enough testing in general
[01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:38.960]  but I don't know what all the inputs
[01:47:38.960 --> 01:47:40.960]  would change
[01:47:40.960 --> 01:47:42.960]  the flavonoid profile
[01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:44.960]  which is really what you're picking up in the mouth
[01:47:44.960 --> 01:47:46.960]  what's your thoughts on SD?
[01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:48.960]  I totally have very strong
[01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:50.960]  thoughts on this
[01:47:50.960 --> 01:47:52.960]  and I came across it young
[01:47:52.960 --> 01:47:54.960]  and it stuck with me
[01:47:55.680 --> 01:47:57.680]  I recognized pot
[01:47:57.680 --> 01:47:59.680]  that people have grown
[01:47:59.680 --> 01:48:01.680]  using fish emulsion or dead fish
[01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:03.680]  in the hole
[01:48:03.680 --> 01:48:05.680]  I can smell the dead fish in the buds
[01:48:05.680 --> 01:48:07.680]  I remember blowing a guy's mind
[01:48:07.680 --> 01:48:09.680]  that a friend of a friend
[01:48:09.680 --> 01:48:11.680]  was coming over to show me
[01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:13.680]  a few pounds in university
[01:48:13.680 --> 01:48:15.680]  and he pulled out his backpack
[01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:17.680]  and before he even
[01:48:17.680 --> 01:48:19.680]  opened the backpack
[01:48:19.680 --> 01:48:21.680]  I said
[01:48:21.680 --> 01:48:23.680]  you use fish emulsion
[01:48:24.400 --> 01:48:26.400]  and he went
[01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:28.400]  why did you say that
[01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:30.400]  and I said well I can tell right now
[01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:32.400]  you use fish to grow your pot
[01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:34.400]  I haven't seen your pot yet
[01:48:34.400 --> 01:48:36.400]  but I can smell the fish already
[01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:38.400]  and he was just like
[01:48:38.400 --> 01:48:40.400]  my brother and I grow this pot
[01:48:40.400 --> 01:48:42.400]  we dig holes
[01:48:42.400 --> 01:48:44.400]  we throw sucker fish in
[01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:46.400]  whenever we're fishing we save all the suckers
[01:48:46.400 --> 01:48:48.400]  and we put a sucker in every hole
[01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:50.400]  but everybody else just says
[01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:52.400]  man your pot stinks
[01:48:53.120 --> 01:48:55.120]  and I was like right away I knew it
[01:48:55.120 --> 01:48:57.120]  because I had another friend
[01:48:57.120 --> 01:48:59.120]  the year before that was trying to grow
[01:48:59.120 --> 01:49:01.120]  in rock wool using nothing
[01:49:01.120 --> 01:49:03.120]  but fish emulsion
[01:49:03.120 --> 01:49:05.120]  and his weed had a very distinctive
[01:49:05.120 --> 01:49:07.120]  dead fish smell
[01:49:07.120 --> 01:49:09.120]  to it
[01:49:09.120 --> 01:49:11.120]  people would still be happy
[01:49:11.120 --> 01:49:13.120]  because it was frosty green buds
[01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:15.120]  but to me it was like
[01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:17.120]  it smells like rotting fish
[01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:19.120]  it really picks up what you're growing it in
[01:49:19.120 --> 01:49:21.120]  you get the sweetness
[01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:23.840]  out of the limey stuff
[01:49:23.840 --> 01:49:25.840]  like you said guanos
[01:49:25.840 --> 01:49:27.840]  but lime really helps a lot
[01:49:27.840 --> 01:49:29.840]  and I've
[01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:31.840]  not the sweetest genetic
[01:49:31.840 --> 01:49:33.840]  I ever grew but I think the sweetest
[01:49:33.840 --> 01:49:35.840]  contribution from an amendment
[01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:37.840]  I ever got was this
[01:49:37.840 --> 01:49:39.840]  hundred year old pile of chicken manure
[01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:41.840]  it was like
[01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:43.840]  tan colored sand
[01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:45.840]  and those buds
[01:49:45.840 --> 01:49:47.840]  there was just something
[01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:49.840]  unreal about them
[01:49:50.560 --> 01:49:52.560]  I've never been able to do that
[01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:54.560]  again exactly
[01:49:54.560 --> 01:49:56.560]  and I totally chalk it up to that one pile
[01:49:56.560 --> 01:49:58.560]  of chicken manure which was like
[01:49:58.560 --> 01:50:00.560]  1 out of 12 ingredients in the soil mix
[01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:02.560]  the only one I could never
[01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:04.560]  source again
[01:50:04.560 --> 01:50:06.560]  those places old sheds
[01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:08.560]  get torn down only so often
[01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:10.560]  I miss that
[01:50:10.560 --> 01:50:12.560]  my buddy had a pig farm
[01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:14.560]  and he used to
[01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:16.560]  take the, they would move the pigs
[01:50:16.560 --> 01:50:18.560]  and then he would take the soil
[01:50:19.280 --> 01:50:21.280]  that had been churned and aged
[01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:23.280]  and he would use that
[01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:25.280]  and the cannabis was beautiful inside it
[01:50:25.280 --> 01:50:27.280]  but just really
[01:50:27.280 --> 01:50:29.280]  rich and full
[01:50:29.280 --> 01:50:31.280]  you wouldn't say it was grown in pig shit
[01:50:31.280 --> 01:50:33.280]  it just had a really good deep
[01:50:33.280 --> 01:50:35.280]  richness
[01:50:35.280 --> 01:50:37.280]  the pig's pretty good because they eat a wide range
[01:50:37.280 --> 01:50:39.280]  of stuff, they're probably eating lots of scraps
[01:50:39.280 --> 01:50:41.280]  and stuff
[01:50:41.280 --> 01:50:43.280]  because whenever they eat the same stuff
[01:50:43.280 --> 01:50:45.280]  it doesn't
[01:50:45.280 --> 01:50:47.280]  I think
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000]  even for weed, like if you just feed it
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000]  steer manure, your weed smells
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000]  like steer manure, when you burn it
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000]  people that don't smoke weed will say your weed
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000]  smells like cow shit
[01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000]  because I know, because one time I grew some
[01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000]  just in steer manure and whenever I lit it up
[01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000]  somewhere people would say your weed smells like cow shit
[01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000]  and it did, you know
[01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000]  it wasn't totally well rotted perhaps
[01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000]  and it was
[01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000]  skewed the profile
[01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000]  it was just
[01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000]  so I found giving them
[01:51:16.720 --> 01:51:18.720]  the more diverse blend in the soil mix
[01:51:18.720 --> 01:51:20.720]  the more kinds of
[01:51:20.720 --> 01:51:22.720]  little bit of a lot of inputs
[01:51:22.720 --> 01:51:24.720]  I found to be better overall
[01:51:24.720 --> 01:51:26.720]  for the texture of the smoke later
[01:51:26.720 --> 01:51:28.720]  than giving it all one thing
[01:51:28.720 --> 01:51:30.720]  it really helps
[01:51:30.720 --> 01:51:32.720]  to diversify what they're eating
[01:51:32.720 --> 01:51:34.720]  and the older I get
[01:51:34.720 --> 01:51:36.720]  the slacker I get
[01:51:36.720 --> 01:51:38.720]  and this year
[01:51:38.720 --> 01:51:40.720]  I've done some in the past where I tried to
[01:51:40.720 --> 01:51:42.720]  do a plant with just what I could
[01:51:42.720 --> 01:51:44.720]  find in a clearing
[01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:47.440]  I'm going to put that in this tree stump
[01:51:47.440 --> 01:51:49.440]  I'm going to throw some of this mud from this
[01:51:49.440 --> 01:51:51.440]  boggy corner on top of that
[01:51:51.440 --> 01:51:53.440]  and stick a seed in there
[01:51:53.440 --> 01:51:55.440]  and take off
[01:51:55.440 --> 01:51:57.440]  and come back and find a plant
[01:51:57.440 --> 01:51:59.440]  and it's rare to do it but you know
[01:51:59.440 --> 01:52:01.440]  you can wild craft the cannabis
[01:52:01.440 --> 01:52:03.440]  if you're crazy enough
[01:52:03.440 --> 01:52:05.440]  but this year I did some
[01:52:05.440 --> 01:52:07.440]  I was tearing apart an aloe plant
[01:52:07.440 --> 01:52:09.440]  to re-pot it because aloe was old
[01:52:09.440 --> 01:52:11.440]  and very overgrown
[01:52:11.440 --> 01:52:13.440]  and root bound and I thought I'd tear this apart
[01:52:14.160 --> 01:52:16.160]  and of course I broke off a bunch of the spears
[01:52:16.160 --> 01:52:18.160]  lots of them
[01:52:18.160 --> 01:52:20.160]  so I ended up putting one or two spears
[01:52:20.160 --> 01:52:22.160]  in each of the pots of the plants
[01:52:22.160 --> 01:52:24.160]  I was putting in this spring
[01:52:24.160 --> 01:52:26.160]  and then I stuck a banana
[01:52:26.160 --> 01:52:28.160]  in each hole
[01:52:28.160 --> 01:52:30.160]  and grew them
[01:52:30.160 --> 01:52:32.160]  I've got pots I did this year
[01:52:32.160 --> 01:52:34.160]  that were chopped up stalks
[01:52:34.160 --> 01:52:36.160]  from last year
[01:52:36.160 --> 01:52:38.160]  put rocks on the bottom of the pot
[01:52:38.160 --> 01:52:40.160]  and then just chopped up pot stalks
[01:52:40.160 --> 01:52:42.160]  with a banana
[01:52:42.880 --> 01:52:44.880]  and a piece of burnt wood
[01:52:44.880 --> 01:52:46.880]  and then I'd cover it with some kitchen compost
[01:52:46.880 --> 01:52:48.880]  from the yard
[01:52:48.880 --> 01:52:50.880]  and never feed
[01:52:50.880 --> 01:52:52.880]  just water them after that
[01:52:52.880 --> 01:52:54.880]  they're just lush and green and bushy and happy
[01:52:54.880 --> 01:52:56.880]  and I think
[01:52:56.880 --> 01:52:58.880]  I'm not reaching out to
[01:52:58.880 --> 01:53:00.880]  buy this or that for them
[01:53:00.880 --> 01:53:02.880]  and I just laugh and it's so easy
[01:53:02.880 --> 01:53:04.880]  people just
[01:53:04.880 --> 01:53:06.880]  if you can make compost in the back corner of your yard
[01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:08.880]  you're halfway there
[01:53:08.880 --> 01:53:10.880]  you're there
[01:53:11.600 --> 01:53:13.600]  we don't use fish here because of the bear
[01:53:13.600 --> 01:53:15.600]  it attracts
[01:53:15.600 --> 01:53:17.600]  coons and bears
[01:53:17.600 --> 01:53:19.600]  so it's better to use for that
[01:53:19.600 --> 01:53:21.600]  I have bear all over my property
[01:53:21.600 --> 01:53:23.600]  so we haven't used fish in years
[01:53:23.600 --> 01:53:25.600]  I used to use fish a really long time ago
[01:53:25.600 --> 01:53:27.600]  but I'd use it as a compost accelerator
[01:53:27.600 --> 01:53:29.600]  so I would use it as a nitrogen source
[01:53:29.600 --> 01:53:31.600]  in compost to be able to start to get it to burn
[01:53:31.600 --> 01:53:33.600]  it's probably ok if it's a couple years old
[01:53:33.600 --> 01:53:35.600]  it was broken
[01:53:35.600 --> 01:53:37.600]  it didn't leave the fish flavor
[01:53:37.600 --> 01:53:39.600]  it's horrible
[01:53:40.320 --> 01:53:42.320]  I used to be able to pick up
[01:53:42.320 --> 01:53:44.320]  what chemical you were running it with
[01:53:44.320 --> 01:53:46.320]  meaning what lines
[01:53:46.320 --> 01:53:48.320]  so if you were a TH grower
[01:53:48.320 --> 01:53:50.320]  or advanced hydro
[01:53:50.320 --> 01:53:52.320]  or you were running cut and edge
[01:53:52.320 --> 01:53:54.320]  or you were running canna
[01:53:54.320 --> 01:53:56.320]  because I was around so many different operations
[01:53:56.320 --> 01:53:58.320]  that I could start to feel
[01:53:58.320 --> 01:54:00.320]  the impact on it
[01:54:00.320 --> 01:54:02.320]  because I could see it
[01:54:02.320 --> 01:54:04.320]  but to me chemical is so simple
[01:54:04.320 --> 01:54:06.320]  it's what you're getting
[01:54:06.320 --> 01:54:08.320]  where with biologically driven
[01:54:09.040 --> 01:54:11.040]  if it's a complex system
[01:54:11.040 --> 01:54:13.040]  there's subtleties
[01:54:13.040 --> 01:54:15.040]  but you can't put your finger on
[01:54:15.040 --> 01:54:17.040]  one thing is this incredible input
[01:54:17.040 --> 01:54:19.040]  to me it's a diversity
[01:54:19.040 --> 01:54:21.040]  and that's where I said
[01:54:21.040 --> 01:54:23.040]  the only thing I noticed ever
[01:54:23.040 --> 01:54:25.040]  and I don't think it's necessary
[01:54:25.040 --> 01:54:27.040]  to put it in your flower
[01:54:27.040 --> 01:54:29.040]  it's just that the flowers
[01:54:29.040 --> 01:54:31.040]  that were entered into the cup
[01:54:31.040 --> 01:54:33.040]  that used that compost from that grape company
[01:54:33.040 --> 01:54:35.040]  it helped that plant's profile shine
[01:54:35.040 --> 01:54:37.040]  and so if we did a big enough test
[01:54:37.760 --> 01:54:39.760]  the sugars and the thing is
[01:54:39.760 --> 01:54:41.760]  it was broken down well so it was available
[01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:43.760]  and it must have
[01:54:43.760 --> 01:54:45.760]  driven higher microbial activity
[01:54:45.760 --> 01:54:47.760]  because of that sugar source originally
[01:54:47.760 --> 01:54:49.760]  and the companies that were making
[01:54:49.760 --> 01:54:51.760]  the compost
[01:54:51.760 --> 01:54:53.760]  easily accessible
[01:54:53.760 --> 01:54:55.760]  through the root
[01:54:55.760 --> 01:54:57.760]  but otherwise
[01:54:57.760 --> 01:54:59.760]  I just noticed when I was doing humic acid
[01:54:59.760 --> 01:55:01.760]  tests for a company
[01:55:01.760 --> 01:55:03.760]  the data was all over the place
[01:55:03.760 --> 01:55:05.760]  meaning huge swings in different
[01:55:06.480 --> 01:55:08.480]  terpenes but when we did
[01:55:08.480 --> 01:55:10.480]  the consumption we couldn't tell the difference
[01:55:10.480 --> 01:55:12.480]  even
[01:55:12.480 --> 01:55:14.480]  with the swings and so even though you'd say
[01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:16.480]  that these terpenes were higher
[01:55:16.480 --> 01:55:18.480]  or these were less or these ratios changed
[01:55:18.480 --> 01:55:20.480]  if you didn't look at the sheet
[01:55:20.480 --> 01:55:22.480]  and you just smoked it
[01:55:22.480 --> 01:55:24.480]  you couldn't tell the difference
[01:55:24.480 --> 01:55:26.480]  and so I think sometimes
[01:55:26.480 --> 01:55:28.480]  the plant
[01:55:28.480 --> 01:55:30.480]  complexity is what matters
[01:55:30.480 --> 01:55:32.480]  you can't take bad herb
[01:55:32.480 --> 01:55:34.480]  and put it into good soil and make it into good herb
[01:55:36.480 --> 01:55:38.480]  bad herb is bad herb
[01:55:38.480 --> 01:55:40.480]  and good herb if it's really good
[01:55:40.480 --> 01:55:42.480]  it's kind of hard to screw it up
[01:55:42.480 --> 01:55:44.480]  it'll make you look smart
[01:55:44.480 --> 01:55:46.480]  and I think that's like
[01:55:46.480 --> 01:55:48.480]  with yield too
[01:55:48.480 --> 01:55:50.480]  back when blue dream was really popular
[01:55:50.480 --> 01:55:52.480]  a lot of it is when the new wave
[01:55:52.480 --> 01:55:54.480]  of grower was coming in
[01:55:54.480 --> 01:55:56.480]  everyone was growing blue dream and they were just breaking their arm off
[01:55:56.480 --> 01:55:58.480]  patting themselves on the back
[01:55:58.480 --> 01:56:00.480]  for their unbelievable ability
[01:56:00.480 --> 01:56:02.480]  and I'm like I don't think it's you
[01:56:02.480 --> 01:56:04.480]  I think that the plant's doing the work
[01:56:05.200 --> 01:56:07.200]  if you shift out of that cultivar
[01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:09.200]  you have a problem
[01:56:09.200 --> 01:56:11.200]  well you know find what works for you
[01:56:11.200 --> 01:56:13.200]  for variety
[01:56:13.200 --> 01:56:15.200]  for people to grow
[01:56:15.200 --> 01:56:17.200]  they're really going to lean towards
[01:56:17.200 --> 01:56:19.200]  things that have
[01:56:19.200 --> 01:56:21.200]  something that is
[01:56:21.200 --> 01:56:23.200]  forgiving and easy to grow
[01:56:23.200 --> 01:56:25.200]  it means the world to people
[01:56:25.200 --> 01:56:27.200]  I want them to come out of the gate
[01:56:27.200 --> 01:56:29.200]  and feel like a winner so that they're hooked
[01:56:29.200 --> 01:56:31.200]  like I am
[01:56:31.200 --> 01:56:33.200]  I am going to stop paying
[01:56:33.920 --> 01:56:35.920]  $70 a fucking 8
[01:56:35.920 --> 01:56:37.920]  and have better read at home
[01:56:37.920 --> 01:56:39.920]  you're nothing
[01:56:39.920 --> 01:56:41.920]  you're just thinking about this cost nothing
[01:56:41.920 --> 01:56:43.920]  if you do it yourself
[01:56:43.920 --> 01:56:45.920]  you can really do it yourself
[01:56:45.920 --> 01:56:47.920]  it allows you to be able to share cannabis differently
[01:56:47.920 --> 01:56:49.920]  that's my thing with
[01:56:49.920 --> 01:56:51.920]  the six legal in California
[01:56:51.920 --> 01:56:53.920]  where I'm like six legal in California
[01:56:53.920 --> 01:56:55.920]  is a lot of grass
[01:56:55.920 --> 01:56:57.920]  and so you grow six different plants
[01:56:57.920 --> 01:56:59.920]  and your neighbor grows six different plants
[01:56:59.920 --> 01:57:01.920]  and now you have twelve varieties
[01:57:02.640 --> 01:57:04.640]  and what it does
[01:57:04.640 --> 01:57:06.640]  it allows you to have incredible diversity
[01:57:06.640 --> 01:57:08.640]  in what you're consuming
[01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:10.640]  at pennies compared to what you have to pay
[01:57:10.640 --> 01:57:12.640]  you can't look at it
[01:57:12.640 --> 01:57:14.640]  like a retail customer anymore
[01:57:14.640 --> 01:57:16.640]  no no
[01:57:16.640 --> 01:57:18.640]  I own a dispensary
[01:57:18.640 --> 01:57:20.640]  but for me the person should be able to consume cannabis
[01:57:20.640 --> 01:57:22.640]  at the level they choose
[01:57:22.640 --> 01:57:24.640]  and once you're not having to be financially limited
[01:57:24.640 --> 01:57:26.640]  on your consumption
[01:57:26.640 --> 01:57:28.640]  it changes how you see cannabis
[01:57:28.640 --> 01:57:30.640]  I look at a pound of weed
[01:57:31.360 --> 01:57:33.360]  and I sit out of that
[01:57:33.360 --> 01:57:35.360]  I don't look at a pound of weed
[01:57:35.360 --> 01:57:37.360]  and roll 400 joints out of that
[01:57:37.360 --> 01:57:39.360]  and I'm like
[01:57:39.360 --> 01:57:41.360]  that looks like maybe
[01:57:41.360 --> 01:57:43.360]  15 really good hash cliffs
[01:57:47.360 --> 01:57:49.360]  so do you make a lot of hash?
[01:57:51.360 --> 01:57:53.360]  I like to
[01:57:53.360 --> 01:57:55.360]  I'm not making a lot now
[01:57:55.360 --> 01:57:57.360]  because I'm not growing much at home
[01:57:57.360 --> 01:57:59.360]  but I have over the years
[01:58:00.080 --> 01:58:02.080]  and I've seen crops
[01:58:02.080 --> 01:58:04.080]  not just selection crops
[01:58:04.080 --> 01:58:06.080]  but also seed production crops
[01:58:06.080 --> 01:58:08.080]  so I'm doing a big production run
[01:58:08.080 --> 01:58:10.080]  of say 100 pounds of weed
[01:58:10.080 --> 01:58:12.080]  but it's fully seeded
[01:58:12.080 --> 01:58:14.080]  well who gets every resin gland
[01:58:14.080 --> 01:58:16.080]  in that greenhouse
[01:58:16.080 --> 01:58:18.080]  I don't sell the resin
[01:58:18.080 --> 01:58:20.080]  I sell the seeds
[01:58:20.080 --> 01:58:22.080]  so to me it was really the thing
[01:58:22.080 --> 01:58:24.080]  that's the number one perk
[01:58:24.080 --> 01:58:26.080]  of doing seed production
[01:58:26.080 --> 01:58:28.080]  was just the gobs of hash
[01:58:28.800 --> 01:58:30.800]  so I experimented
[01:58:30.800 --> 01:58:32.800]  a whole lot of ways
[01:58:32.800 --> 01:58:34.800]  with different dry sift
[01:58:34.800 --> 01:58:36.800]  and lots of other people have too
[01:58:36.800 --> 01:58:38.800]  but I've definitely made some
[01:58:38.800 --> 01:58:40.800]  ridiculously melty dry sift
[01:58:40.800 --> 01:58:42.800]  that you couldn't look at
[01:58:42.800 --> 01:58:44.800]  without it melting
[01:58:44.800 --> 01:58:46.800]  to me it's just the gold standard
[01:58:46.800 --> 01:58:48.800]  first I want to see
[01:58:48.800 --> 01:58:50.800]  the clean glands of it
[01:58:50.800 --> 01:58:52.800]  before anything else
[01:58:52.800 --> 01:58:54.800]  just the clean resin glands
[01:58:54.800 --> 01:58:56.800]  that is the point of the plant
[01:58:57.520 --> 01:58:59.520]  the bud is the tree
[01:58:59.520 --> 01:59:01.520]  the resin gland is the apple on the tree
[01:59:01.520 --> 01:59:03.520]  I don't mean to smoke the whole tree
[01:59:03.520 --> 01:59:05.520]  I love dry sift
[01:59:05.520 --> 01:59:07.520]  we don't see it too much
[01:59:07.520 --> 01:59:09.520]  but dry sift
[01:59:09.520 --> 01:59:11.520]  it doesn't yield enough
[01:59:11.520 --> 01:59:13.520]  for them to see it commercially
[01:59:13.520 --> 01:59:15.520]  so most people don't get their hands on it
[01:59:15.520 --> 01:59:17.520]  but we have a lot of people
[01:59:17.520 --> 01:59:19.520]  oh god the flavor is so much better
[01:59:19.520 --> 01:59:21.520]  it's complex in a different way
[01:59:21.520 --> 01:59:23.520]  it's undisturbed
[01:59:23.520 --> 01:59:25.520]  it's undisturbed
[01:59:26.240 --> 01:59:28.240]  it's a full spectrum of that plant
[01:59:28.240 --> 01:59:30.240]  and if you've got it off
[01:59:30.240 --> 01:59:32.240]  well it's still fresh enough
[01:59:32.240 --> 01:59:34.240]  that it hasn't lost all its
[01:59:34.240 --> 01:59:36.240]  smell and taste
[01:59:36.240 --> 01:59:38.240]  and you've kept it that way
[01:59:38.240 --> 01:59:40.240]  it's gorgeous
[01:59:40.240 --> 01:59:42.240]  and if you're squeezing resin out of it
[01:59:42.240 --> 01:59:44.240]  for cleaner dabbing
[01:59:44.240 --> 01:59:46.240]  even better
[01:59:46.240 --> 01:59:48.240]  there's nothing wrong with that
[01:59:48.240 --> 01:59:50.240]  but as soon as you make resin out of it
[01:59:50.240 --> 01:59:52.240]  it already, the characteristic changes
[01:59:52.240 --> 01:59:54.240]  no matter how good it is
[01:59:54.960 --> 01:59:56.960]  I think the biggest difference is probably dabbing resin
[01:59:56.960 --> 01:59:58.960]  and resin pressed
[01:59:58.960 --> 02:00:00.960]  largely from dry sift
[02:00:00.960 --> 02:00:02.960]  and that's mainly because
[02:00:02.960 --> 02:00:04.960]  a friend gave me like a kilo of dry sift
[02:00:04.960 --> 02:00:06.960]  in the spring
[02:00:06.960 --> 02:00:08.960]  and I've been just squishing as needed
[02:00:08.960 --> 02:00:10.960]  to keep a puddle through my head
[02:00:10.960 --> 02:00:12.960]  you know
[02:00:12.960 --> 02:00:14.960]  so do you have a resin press
[02:00:14.960 --> 02:00:16.960]  like in the other room
[02:00:16.960 --> 02:00:18.960]  I've got the little canna clamp one
[02:00:18.960 --> 02:00:20.960]  you know that one
[02:00:20.960 --> 02:00:22.960]  it's like a handheld
[02:00:23.680 --> 02:00:25.680]  it's like a vice grip
[02:00:25.680 --> 02:00:27.680]  with two plates on it
[02:00:27.680 --> 02:00:29.680]  so you can set the temperature
[02:00:29.680 --> 02:00:31.680]  and then squeeze it in the plates
[02:00:31.680 --> 02:00:33.680]  but it's small
[02:00:33.680 --> 02:00:35.680]  it's like maybe 2 by 4 inches
[02:00:35.680 --> 02:00:37.680]  or something like that
[02:00:37.680 --> 02:00:39.680]  but if you pack in the bags
[02:00:39.680 --> 02:00:41.680]  up with dry sift
[02:00:41.680 --> 02:00:43.680]  that's decent quality
[02:00:43.680 --> 02:00:45.680]  you're getting a pretty good run
[02:00:45.680 --> 02:00:47.680]  coming out of a couple of those
[02:00:47.680 --> 02:00:49.680]  but basically every two months
[02:00:49.680 --> 02:00:51.680]  I'll set it up and squeeze the ten bags
[02:00:52.400 --> 02:00:54.400]  and then I'll put them in the freezer
[02:00:54.400 --> 02:00:56.400]  full of pressed stuff
[02:00:56.400 --> 02:00:58.400]  I've got to throw them in some alcohol
[02:00:58.400 --> 02:01:00.400]  clean them off
[02:01:00.400 --> 02:01:02.400]  and then do another run
[02:01:02.400 --> 02:01:04.400]  because I just recycle those bags
[02:01:04.400 --> 02:01:06.400]  and just to clarify
[02:01:06.400 --> 02:01:08.400]  Cascadian Grown Ass on YouTube
[02:01:08.400 --> 02:01:10.400]  so did Steve breed for hash
[02:01:10.400 --> 02:01:12.400]  then I think what you said
[02:01:12.400 --> 02:01:14.400]  is you were breeding
[02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:16.400]  and it was all seed weed
[02:01:16.400 --> 02:01:18.400]  so you made hash out of it
[02:01:18.400 --> 02:01:20.400]  not that you were breeding for hash
[02:01:21.120 --> 02:01:23.120]  I did breed for hash
[02:01:23.120 --> 02:01:25.120]  some plants were specifically bred
[02:01:25.120 --> 02:01:27.120]  for hash but that wasn't all I was doing
[02:01:27.120 --> 02:01:29.120]  it was more a factor
[02:01:29.120 --> 02:01:31.120]  of from any seed production
[02:01:31.120 --> 02:01:33.120]  run, hash is a
[02:01:33.120 --> 02:01:35.120]  by-product
[02:01:35.120 --> 02:01:37.120]  and some people think it's a lesser hash
[02:01:37.120 --> 02:01:39.120]  than you get from sensimilla
[02:01:39.120 --> 02:01:41.120]  I don't really see
[02:01:41.120 --> 02:01:43.120]  the difference, I don't know
[02:01:43.120 --> 02:01:45.120]  if you want to that's fine
[02:01:45.120 --> 02:01:47.120]  for me it's just as delicious
[02:01:47.120 --> 02:01:49.120]  maybe if
[02:01:49.840 --> 02:01:51.840]  the seed yield cut into the hash field
[02:01:51.840 --> 02:01:53.840]  I could see that a bit
[02:01:53.840 --> 02:01:55.840]  it was a non-issue
[02:01:55.840 --> 02:01:57.840]  if you're running 40 kilos
[02:01:57.840 --> 02:01:59.840]  of dry bud to get at the seeds
[02:01:59.840 --> 02:02:01.840]  you've got to get past the hash first
[02:02:01.840 --> 02:02:03.840]  you know, so you might as well
[02:02:03.840 --> 02:02:05.840]  keep it
[02:02:05.840 --> 02:02:07.840]  I can clean up some beautiful pieces
[02:02:07.840 --> 02:02:09.840]  and I know at one point
[02:02:09.840 --> 02:02:11.840]  after doing that for a few years in Switzerland
[02:02:11.840 --> 02:02:13.840]  at one point I had
[02:02:13.840 --> 02:02:15.840]  the hubris to think I even had
[02:02:15.840 --> 02:02:17.840]  a lifetime supply
[02:02:18.560 --> 02:02:20.560]  and of course like 2 years later
[02:02:20.560 --> 02:02:22.560]  I'll never get that
[02:02:24.560 --> 02:02:26.560]  So just quickly
[02:02:26.560 --> 02:02:28.560]  Steve because I could sense that you felt
[02:02:28.560 --> 02:02:30.560]  uncomfortable being the only Canadian
[02:02:30.560 --> 02:02:32.560]  in the conversation
[02:02:32.560 --> 02:02:34.560]  I pulled in a ringer
[02:02:34.560 --> 02:02:36.560]  and you guys were talking
[02:02:36.560 --> 02:02:38.560]  about kind of the home growers
[02:02:38.560 --> 02:02:40.560]  wait you're not Canadian?
[02:02:40.560 --> 02:02:42.560]  What? I know you're from
[02:02:42.560 --> 02:02:44.560]  like Washington State right?
[02:02:44.560 --> 02:02:46.560]  Okay, north of me
[02:02:47.280 --> 02:02:49.280]  Alright, so how about this
[02:02:49.280 --> 02:02:51.280]  you're a non-Californian
[02:02:51.280 --> 02:02:53.280]  you felt uncomfortable
[02:02:53.280 --> 02:02:55.280]  so I brought in another non-Californian
[02:02:55.280 --> 02:02:57.280]  Sarah you fucked that up
[02:02:57.280 --> 02:02:59.280]  why can't you just be Canadian?
[02:02:59.280 --> 02:03:01.280]  Sorry!
[02:03:01.280 --> 02:03:03.280]  Hey guys, I had to jump in
[02:03:03.280 --> 02:03:05.280]  because what an opportunity to talk to two
[02:03:05.280 --> 02:03:07.280]  awesome guys that I got to meet
[02:03:07.280 --> 02:03:09.280]  through the cannabis world
[02:03:09.280 --> 02:03:11.280]  Kevin Jodery and Steve
[02:03:11.280 --> 02:03:13.280]  I love you both, you guys are so inspiring
[02:03:13.280 --> 02:03:15.280]  oh my gosh I got to hang out with Kevin
[02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000]  at all the Regen conferences
[02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000]  and I got to hang out with Steve at the 420 event
[02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000]  and taste some of his wine
[02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000]  and dabbed with him
[02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000]  and yeah it was a great time
[02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000]  so love you both
[02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000]  and I had to get on here and say hello to both
[02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000]  Great to see you
[02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000]  So Tara you're growing
[02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000]  and just quickly
[02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000]  can you lower your audio levels
[02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000]  because it's blowing out
[02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000]  a little bit
[02:03:44.720 --> 02:03:46.720]  So Tara, you were just in the garden
[02:03:46.720 --> 02:03:50.120]  what are you growing?
[02:03:50.120 --> 02:03:52.120]  I have all kinds of stuff I'm growing
[02:03:52.120 --> 02:03:54.120]  I have a huge vegetable garden
[02:03:54.120 --> 02:03:56.120]  as well, flowers and all kinds of stuff
[02:03:56.120 --> 02:03:58.120]  but as far as cannabis
[02:03:58.120 --> 02:04:00.120]  this year I have some
[02:04:00.120 --> 02:04:02.120]  dragonfly genetics that I picked up
[02:04:02.120 --> 02:04:04.120]  this year, dragonfly earth medicine
[02:04:04.120 --> 02:04:06.120]  I have also some
[02:04:06.120 --> 02:04:08.120]  from Kaya
[02:04:08.120 --> 02:04:10.120]  Northwest Pacific Ritz
[02:04:10.120 --> 02:04:12.120]  I have a couple of his breeds
[02:04:12.120 --> 02:04:14.120]  Speaking of Kaya
[02:04:14.840 --> 02:04:16.840]  Kaya is
[02:04:16.840 --> 02:04:18.840]  hopefully jumping on in a minute
[02:04:18.840 --> 02:04:20.840]  but just quickly
[02:04:20.840 --> 02:04:22.840]  can you
[02:04:22.840 --> 02:04:24.840]  go into the audio settings
[02:04:24.840 --> 02:04:26.840]  and on your mic
[02:04:26.840 --> 02:04:28.840]  or I don't know
[02:04:28.840 --> 02:04:30.840]  if you have an external mixing board
[02:04:30.840 --> 02:04:32.840]  but even just lower it on that
[02:04:36.500 --> 02:04:38.500]  and while you're doing that
[02:04:40.500 --> 02:04:42.500]  Steve and Kevin
[02:04:42.500 --> 02:04:44.500]  just quickly the most recent question
[02:04:45.220 --> 02:04:47.220]  Charles
[02:04:47.220 --> 02:04:49.220]  not Charles
[02:04:49.220 --> 02:04:51.220]  but Charles said
[02:04:51.220 --> 02:04:53.220]  can you ask Kevin and Steve
[02:04:53.220 --> 02:04:55.220]  how they preserve their gene lines
[02:04:55.220 --> 02:04:57.220]  do they maintain a nursery
[02:04:57.220 --> 02:04:59.220]  to rotate fresh mothers
[02:04:59.220 --> 02:05:01.220]  or do they self the plants for seed
[02:05:05.220 --> 02:05:07.220]  so large breeding runs
[02:05:07.220 --> 02:05:09.220]  for phenohunting
[02:05:09.220 --> 02:05:11.220]  do they flower most of the plants
[02:05:11.220 --> 02:05:13.220]  what percentage of plants are weeded out
[02:05:13.940 --> 02:05:15.940]  that's a good question
[02:05:15.940 --> 02:05:17.940]  go for it Kevin
[02:05:17.940 --> 02:05:19.940]  let's see
[02:05:19.940 --> 02:05:21.940]  in preservation most of my
[02:05:21.940 --> 02:05:23.940]  stock that I've collected is all in vitro
[02:05:23.940 --> 02:05:25.940]  now so I hold it all
[02:05:25.940 --> 02:05:27.940]  in vitro so that it's just
[02:05:27.940 --> 02:05:29.940]  easier to preserve so that there's no
[02:05:29.940 --> 02:05:31.940]  pathogenic contamination
[02:05:31.940 --> 02:05:33.940]  and then I like to
[02:05:35.940 --> 02:05:37.940]  take the stock
[02:05:37.940 --> 02:05:39.940]  is that with Sergio
[02:05:39.940 --> 02:05:41.940]  no no Sergio
[02:05:42.660 --> 02:05:44.660]  Sergio runs Cultivated
[02:05:44.660 --> 02:05:46.660]  I think he's watching right now
[02:05:46.660 --> 02:05:48.660]  Sergio's a good dude
[02:05:48.660 --> 02:05:50.660]  I like Sergio
[02:05:50.660 --> 02:05:52.660]  he's got a good operation
[02:05:52.660 --> 02:05:54.660]  and he's a fucking really good dude
[02:05:54.660 --> 02:05:56.660]  he's got a nice crew, good family
[02:05:56.660 --> 02:05:58.660]  and that's the kind of shit I like
[02:05:58.660 --> 02:06:00.660]  in cannabis is that you're cool
[02:06:00.660 --> 02:06:02.660]  because that's really what kind of keeps
[02:06:02.660 --> 02:06:04.660]  things moving because
[02:06:04.660 --> 02:06:06.660]  it's the human connection that drives the
[02:06:06.660 --> 02:06:08.660]  business you have to be able
[02:06:08.660 --> 02:06:10.660]  to be alive with it
[02:06:11.380 --> 02:06:13.380]  his attitude is nothing but positive
[02:06:13.380 --> 02:06:15.380]  what he does is he gets stock
[02:06:15.380 --> 02:06:17.380]  that's been scrubbed
[02:06:17.380 --> 02:06:19.380]  so it's virally free of anything
[02:06:19.380 --> 02:06:21.380]  and then no other
[02:06:21.380 --> 02:06:23.380]  exterior contaminants
[02:06:23.380 --> 02:06:25.380]  and then he runs it through a really
[02:06:25.380 --> 02:06:27.380]  clean operation and they're releasing
[02:06:27.380 --> 02:06:29.380]  beautiful plants so I think he calls
[02:06:29.380 --> 02:06:31.380]  it first gen mom
[02:06:31.380 --> 02:06:33.380]  but really it's stuff that's coming out
[02:06:33.380 --> 02:06:35.380]  of TC that he then conventionally
[02:06:35.380 --> 02:06:37.380]  propagates but he does a really
[02:06:37.380 --> 02:06:39.380]  good job and he's got a neat little
[02:06:40.100 --> 02:06:42.100]  I don't know the exact name of it
[02:06:42.100 --> 02:06:44.100]  but what he's doing is he's working with smaller
[02:06:44.100 --> 02:06:46.100]  craft breeders
[02:06:46.100 --> 02:06:48.100]  and he's bringing out some of that stock
[02:06:48.100 --> 02:06:50.100]  into the public after they R&D it
[02:06:50.100 --> 02:06:52.100]  and so what it does it allows you to
[02:06:52.100 --> 02:06:54.100]  bring stuff forward
[02:06:54.100 --> 02:06:56.100]  that's not in the normal queue
[02:06:56.100 --> 02:06:58.100]  the problem with being a nursery is
[02:06:58.100 --> 02:07:00.100]  that most of the
[02:07:00.100 --> 02:07:02.100]  nursery operators are running the same exact
[02:07:02.100 --> 02:07:04.100]  material and the problem is it
[02:07:04.100 --> 02:07:06.100]  bottlenecks the entire industry so there's
[02:07:06.100 --> 02:07:08.100]  only so many nurseries selling stock
[02:07:08.820 --> 02:07:10.820]  and there's only so many farmers growing stock
[02:07:10.820 --> 02:07:12.820]  and pretty soon there's an overabundance of certain
[02:07:12.820 --> 02:07:14.820]  things that are trendy
[02:07:14.820 --> 02:07:16.820]  and once you fill that queue up
[02:07:16.820 --> 02:07:18.820]  you're screwed because it's just too much
[02:07:18.820 --> 02:07:20.820]  and so
[02:07:20.820 --> 02:07:22.820]  I call it the popularity of the kiss of death
[02:07:22.820 --> 02:07:24.820]  yes yes
[02:07:24.820 --> 02:07:26.820]  it's damaging for everyone involved
[02:07:26.820 --> 02:07:28.820]  and so Sergio's doing his own
[02:07:28.820 --> 02:07:30.820]  work with smaller
[02:07:30.820 --> 02:07:32.820]  operators but what he does is he makes sure
[02:07:32.820 --> 02:07:34.820]  that all the material that comes into his facility
[02:07:34.820 --> 02:07:36.820]  is clean before it gets there then they run a really
[02:07:37.540 --> 02:07:39.540]  I'm so busy with my own shit here
[02:07:39.540 --> 02:07:41.540]  I don't have any time with the outdoor
[02:07:41.540 --> 02:07:43.540]  and it's been a fucking brutal year for me
[02:07:43.540 --> 02:07:45.540]  with the cows, fucking cows are killing me
[02:07:45.540 --> 02:07:47.540]  but
[02:07:47.540 --> 02:07:49.540]  it's for real
[02:07:49.540 --> 02:07:51.540]  but otherwise yeah I know his stuff is solid
[02:07:51.540 --> 02:07:53.540]  I use
[02:07:53.540 --> 02:07:55.540]  another laboratory to hold all my
[02:07:55.540 --> 02:07:57.540]  material and what it does it lets me
[02:07:57.540 --> 02:07:59.540]  hold a collection of like you know
[02:07:59.540 --> 02:08:01.540]  90, 100 different cultivars in
[02:08:01.540 --> 02:08:03.540]  vitro form
[02:08:03.540 --> 02:08:05.540]  and then I hold a couple of them
[02:08:06.260 --> 02:08:08.260]  and I can hold myself in hand
[02:08:08.260 --> 02:08:10.260]  stuff that I want to grow at my house
[02:08:10.260 --> 02:08:12.260]  for my outdoor things like that
[02:08:12.260 --> 02:08:14.260]  and so I can hold a couple things
[02:08:14.260 --> 02:08:16.260]  and so like this year you know I'm growing
[02:08:16.260 --> 02:08:18.260]  a peanut butter and jelly
[02:08:18.260 --> 02:08:20.260]  I'm doing something for Nick Rizdin
[02:08:20.260 --> 02:08:22.260]  where he did a cherry pie to a GMO
[02:08:22.260 --> 02:08:24.260]  I'm running
[02:08:24.260 --> 02:08:26.260]  something Josh Rutherford did
[02:08:26.260 --> 02:08:28.260]  which is a black lime reserve
[02:08:28.260 --> 02:08:30.260]  to the testarosa
[02:08:30.260 --> 02:08:32.260]  which is killer
[02:08:32.260 --> 02:08:34.260]  and then I have the original cookie
[02:08:34.980 --> 02:08:36.980]  I got a congo
[02:08:36.980 --> 02:08:38.980]  and then
[02:08:38.980 --> 02:08:40.980]  Sergio
[02:08:40.980 --> 02:08:42.980]  through moving it through the nursery
[02:08:42.980 --> 02:08:44.980]  through the storefront I was able to grab some of the
[02:08:44.980 --> 02:08:46.980]  cuts that he did
[02:08:46.980 --> 02:08:48.980]  that are stock that I released
[02:08:48.980 --> 02:08:50.980]  into the world years prior
[02:08:50.980 --> 02:08:52.980]  and then they were scrubbed and then he
[02:08:52.980 --> 02:08:54.980]  released them and it was nice to get them
[02:08:54.980 --> 02:08:56.980]  back scrubbed because it was the first time
[02:08:56.980 --> 02:08:58.980]  I had seen some of these cuts scrubbed
[02:08:58.980 --> 02:09:00.980]  and so it's funny I know the plant
[02:09:00.980 --> 02:09:02.980]  really well because I've had it for so long
[02:09:03.700 --> 02:09:05.700]  and I didn't know it because
[02:09:05.700 --> 02:09:07.700]  now it's brand new
[02:09:07.700 --> 02:09:09.700]  so that's why I like to hold material
[02:09:09.700 --> 02:09:11.700]  because really conventional is very
[02:09:11.700 --> 02:09:13.700]  difficult if you're busy
[02:09:13.700 --> 02:09:15.700]  and the idea that
[02:09:15.700 --> 02:09:17.700]  I call it a librarian
[02:09:17.700 --> 02:09:19.700]  you have to be basically obsessed
[02:09:19.700 --> 02:09:21.700]  with controlling the environment
[02:09:21.700 --> 02:09:23.700]  and the plant because if you lose them
[02:09:23.700 --> 02:09:25.700]  you're done
[02:09:25.700 --> 02:09:27.700]  so in vitro and then
[02:09:27.700 --> 02:09:29.700]  I back up some of the stuff that I love most
[02:09:29.700 --> 02:09:31.700]  in hand where I just hold it myself in small form
[02:09:32.420 --> 02:09:34.420]  with stock that I'm trying to hold
[02:09:34.420 --> 02:09:36.420]  in form
[02:09:36.420 --> 02:09:38.420]  you can reverse it and hold it in self
[02:09:38.420 --> 02:09:40.420]  it's not going to be the same thing
[02:09:40.420 --> 02:09:42.420]  but it will at least let you concentrate
[02:09:42.420 --> 02:09:44.420]  the genes in that direction because you didn't bring in
[02:09:44.420 --> 02:09:46.420]  an exterior male
[02:09:46.420 --> 02:09:48.420]  and for
[02:09:48.420 --> 02:09:50.420]  population sifting in stock
[02:09:50.420 --> 02:09:52.420]  you know I'd say you know
[02:09:52.420 --> 02:09:54.420]  3% of what you play
[02:09:54.420 --> 02:09:56.420]  with is what you want
[02:09:56.420 --> 02:09:58.420]  because you get a lot of diversity
[02:09:58.420 --> 02:10:00.420]  in a breed but it's not
[02:10:01.140 --> 02:10:03.140]  the detail
[02:10:03.140 --> 02:10:05.140]  qualities that you want that reflect
[02:10:05.140 --> 02:10:07.140]  it and that's where when Steve and I were talking
[02:10:07.140 --> 02:10:09.140]  earlier you know 250 is a minimum
[02:10:09.140 --> 02:10:11.140]  because it lets them get an outlier recessive
[02:10:11.140 --> 02:10:13.140]  you know one out every 250
[02:10:13.140 --> 02:10:15.140]  when we were doing when we sifted out that
[02:10:15.140 --> 02:10:17.140]  creme brulee I got a creme brulee cut that I think makes
[02:10:17.140 --> 02:10:19.140]  some of the best concentrate I've ever experienced in my life
[02:10:19.140 --> 02:10:21.140]  that was out of probably a thousand
[02:10:21.140 --> 02:10:23.140]  plants and that was off of
[02:10:23.140 --> 02:10:25.140]  a 10,000 square foot outdoor
[02:10:25.140 --> 02:10:27.140]  and
[02:10:27.140 --> 02:10:29.140]  it allowed us to find an outlier
[02:10:29.860 --> 02:10:31.860]  I wasn't looking for production numbers on that
[02:10:31.860 --> 02:10:33.860]  I was looking for something that had a
[02:10:33.860 --> 02:10:35.860]  scent profile that was
[02:10:35.860 --> 02:10:37.860]  profound that replicated
[02:10:37.860 --> 02:10:39.860]  in taste
[02:10:39.860 --> 02:10:41.860]  and the way we found the flavor
[02:10:41.860 --> 02:10:43.860]  was we were doing steam
[02:10:43.860 --> 02:10:45.860]  distillation of the flower
[02:10:45.860 --> 02:10:47.860]  and we would infuse water with
[02:10:47.860 --> 02:10:49.860]  the terps and so when we
[02:10:49.860 --> 02:10:51.860]  took the steam distillation we could
[02:10:51.860 --> 02:10:53.860]  put it in some spring water and drink it
[02:10:53.860 --> 02:10:55.860]  it would allow us to get the flavor right
[02:10:55.860 --> 02:10:57.860]  away of what we were going to experience in the mouth
[02:10:58.580 --> 02:11:00.580]  and it let us sift through a tremendous amount
[02:11:00.580 --> 02:11:02.580]  of stock to find out which one really had
[02:11:02.580 --> 02:11:04.580]  the desirable traits
[02:11:04.580 --> 02:11:06.580]  and the concentrate business
[02:11:06.580 --> 02:11:08.580]  that would have been like 7 years ago
[02:11:08.580 --> 02:11:10.580]  the concentrate business at the time
[02:11:10.580 --> 02:11:12.580]  was just explosive
[02:11:12.580 --> 02:11:14.580]  and I was hunting things for that purpose
[02:11:14.580 --> 02:11:16.580]  but for me whenever
[02:11:16.580 --> 02:11:18.580]  I do breeding work
[02:11:18.580 --> 02:11:20.580]  it's really always just to take conventional
[02:11:20.580 --> 02:11:22.580]  lines and then hold them in form
[02:11:22.580 --> 02:11:24.580]  so I have the seed stock banked
[02:11:24.580 --> 02:11:26.580]  I just want to have
[02:11:26.800 --> 02:11:28.800]  preservation so I can open up a population
[02:11:28.800 --> 02:11:30.800]  down the road and look
[02:11:30.800 --> 02:11:32.800]  I've never been a seed company
[02:11:32.800 --> 02:11:34.800]  I don't consider myself a breeder
[02:11:34.800 --> 02:11:36.800]  even though I'm always tagged into breeding stuff
[02:11:36.800 --> 02:11:38.800]  my work
[02:11:38.800 --> 02:11:40.800]  with breeders is I acquire
[02:11:40.800 --> 02:11:42.800]  the source material
[02:11:42.800 --> 02:11:44.800]  where my connections into grabbing
[02:11:44.800 --> 02:11:46.800]  stock is pretty good
[02:11:46.800 --> 02:11:48.800]  and so I can
[02:11:48.800 --> 02:11:50.800]  find things that I think would work
[02:11:50.800 --> 02:11:52.800]  well in a project and then I can help you
[02:11:52.800 --> 02:11:54.800]  go through the progeny to find
[02:11:55.020 --> 02:11:57.020]  out the marketability
[02:11:57.020 --> 02:11:59.020]  and I work with breeders
[02:11:59.020 --> 02:12:01.020]  my mom was a research geneticist
[02:12:01.020 --> 02:12:03.020]  so I know the work required
[02:12:03.020 --> 02:12:05.020]  to be a real breeder
[02:12:05.020 --> 02:12:07.020]  and I knew that my skills wasn't
[02:12:07.020 --> 02:12:09.020]  that direction, mine was
[02:12:09.020 --> 02:12:11.020]  an interpretation, it was an acquisition
[02:12:11.020 --> 02:12:13.020]  and interpretation
[02:12:13.020 --> 02:12:15.020]  and so I like to work with breeders
[02:12:15.020 --> 02:12:17.020]  that do the replication
[02:12:17.020 --> 02:12:19.020]  and then I like to go and do the sifting work
[02:12:19.020 --> 02:12:21.020]  with them to find the stuff that I think would
[02:12:21.020 --> 02:12:23.020]  really shine in the market
[02:12:23.240 --> 02:12:25.240]  I like to be involved in specific circumstances
[02:12:25.240 --> 02:12:27.240]  I like to be involved in that end
[02:12:27.240 --> 02:12:29.240]  and that's where I get the most
[02:12:29.240 --> 02:12:31.240]  enjoyment and I think that
[02:12:31.240 --> 02:12:33.240]  for most individuals that's really where you have to
[02:12:33.240 --> 02:12:35.240]  find is your place, you don't have to be
[02:12:35.240 --> 02:12:37.240]  everybody, you can just be you
[02:12:37.240 --> 02:12:39.240]  and once you're you
[02:12:39.240 --> 02:12:41.240]  and you're good at you, you're okay
[02:12:41.240 --> 02:12:43.240]  That's it
[02:12:43.240 --> 02:12:45.240]  and if I can
[02:12:45.240 --> 02:12:47.240]  add on the guy
[02:12:47.240 --> 02:12:49.240]  was saying about
[02:12:49.240 --> 02:12:51.240]  dimming him out
[02:12:51.460 --> 02:12:53.460]  The policy I generally do is I start
[02:12:53.460 --> 02:12:55.460]  as many seeds as I'm going to
[02:12:55.460 --> 02:12:57.460]  of that line
[02:12:57.460 --> 02:12:59.460]  and I thin out a quarter of the plants
[02:12:59.460 --> 02:13:01.460]  at each
[02:13:01.460 --> 02:13:03.460]  transplant
[02:13:03.460 --> 02:13:05.460]  so I know the last years I was running
[02:13:05.460 --> 02:13:07.460]  selection fields in Switzerland
[02:13:07.460 --> 02:13:09.460]  before I left
[02:13:09.460 --> 02:13:11.460]  the things I was mainly working on
[02:13:11.460 --> 02:13:13.460]  I had tons of seed of because I made it
[02:13:13.460 --> 02:13:15.460]  in big batches
[02:13:15.460 --> 02:13:17.460]  so I could start 10,000 seeds of each
[02:13:17.460 --> 02:13:19.460]  line of sweet tooth and 10,000 seeds
[02:13:19.680 --> 02:13:21.680]  of each line of fish caviar
[02:13:21.680 --> 02:13:23.680]  and then those would just be in the flats
[02:13:23.680 --> 02:13:25.680]  but as soon as they went to
[02:13:25.680 --> 02:13:27.680]  like the 10 cm or 4 inch pots
[02:13:27.680 --> 02:13:29.680]  I would only
[02:13:29.680 --> 02:13:31.680]  transplant the best 25%
[02:13:31.680 --> 02:13:33.680]  and I would kill
[02:13:33.680 --> 02:13:35.680]  75%
[02:13:35.680 --> 02:13:37.680]  and then I just repeated that
[02:13:37.680 --> 02:13:39.680]  on maybe every 2 weeks
[02:13:39.680 --> 02:13:41.680]  or every 3 weeks I'd go to transplant
[02:13:41.680 --> 02:13:43.680]  and I'd ditch 3 quarters
[02:13:43.680 --> 02:13:45.680]  of them
[02:13:45.680 --> 02:13:47.680]  and you're just getting intimate
[02:13:47.900 --> 02:13:49.900]  and you're just going to keep them small
[02:13:49.900 --> 02:13:51.900]  and figure it out
[02:13:51.900 --> 02:13:53.900]  you can smell
[02:13:53.900 --> 02:13:55.900]  the stalk of a seedling
[02:13:55.900 --> 02:13:57.900]  even if you're looking for
[02:13:57.900 --> 02:13:59.900]  smell as one of your characteristics
[02:13:59.900 --> 02:14:01.900]  you can start finding that in trays of seedlings
[02:14:01.900 --> 02:14:03.900]  you know if you've got the nose for it
[02:14:03.900 --> 02:14:05.900]  so I can quickly
[02:14:05.900 --> 02:14:07.900]  thin them out
[02:14:07.900 --> 02:14:09.900]  to the potential ones
[02:14:09.900 --> 02:14:11.900]  and
[02:14:11.900 --> 02:14:13.900]  that's how I get around
[02:14:13.900 --> 02:14:15.900]  ending up with 10,000 of each
[02:14:16.120 --> 02:14:18.120]  I want to end up with 100 of each
[02:14:18.120 --> 02:14:20.120]  maybe
[02:14:20.120 --> 02:14:22.120]  but I would
[02:14:22.120 --> 02:14:24.120]  try and start as many as I could
[02:14:24.120 --> 02:14:26.120]  and the most I was reliably able to
[02:14:26.120 --> 02:14:28.120]  start of each line
[02:14:28.120 --> 02:14:30.120]  was 10,000 per line
[02:14:30.120 --> 02:14:32.120]  and that would be
[02:14:32.120 --> 02:14:34.120]  in fluorescent shelves
[02:14:34.120 --> 02:14:36.120]  that I had for clones
[02:14:36.120 --> 02:14:38.120]  and that was set up originally
[02:14:38.120 --> 02:14:40.120]  as a clone place to make
[02:14:40.120 --> 02:14:42.120]  50,000 clones every 2 weeks
[02:14:42.120 --> 02:14:44.120]  but we didn't need the partners
[02:14:44.340 --> 02:14:46.340]  I wanted all those clones
[02:14:46.340 --> 02:14:48.340]  couldn't actually come through with selling that many clones
[02:14:48.340 --> 02:14:50.340]  so I was able to just repurpose that
[02:14:50.340 --> 02:14:52.340]  for starting seeds
[02:14:52.340 --> 02:14:54.340]  in the springtime if I wanted to get
[02:14:54.340 --> 02:14:56.340]  huge numbers sprouted
[02:14:56.340 --> 02:14:58.340]  before thinning them out
[02:14:58.340 --> 02:15:00.340]  you know
[02:15:00.340 --> 02:15:02.340]  so that was my angle
[02:15:02.340 --> 02:15:04.340]  How does your selection change
[02:15:04.340 --> 02:15:06.340]  after you get to that 100 that you're looking for
[02:15:06.340 --> 02:15:08.340]  or do you just grow them all out
[02:15:08.340 --> 02:15:10.340]  and see what you see or
[02:15:10.340 --> 02:15:12.340]  well yeah some of them
[02:15:12.560 --> 02:15:14.560]  if you're working with something
[02:15:14.560 --> 02:15:16.560]  that's pretty stable
[02:15:16.560 --> 02:15:18.560]  you're not worried too much about
[02:15:18.560 --> 02:15:20.560]  you know really finding
[02:15:20.560 --> 02:15:22.560]  anything that you couldn't find
[02:15:22.560 --> 02:15:24.560]  with numbers at that point because
[02:15:24.560 --> 02:15:26.560]  you know ok I've got everything
[02:15:26.560 --> 02:15:28.560]  it's all the same color
[02:15:28.560 --> 02:15:30.560]  it all smells the same
[02:15:30.560 --> 02:15:32.560]  it's all roughly the same potency
[02:15:32.560 --> 02:15:34.560]  which ones sturdier plant
[02:15:34.560 --> 02:15:36.560]  you know at that point
[02:15:36.560 --> 02:15:38.560]  but other than that if you're getting
[02:15:38.560 --> 02:15:40.560]  if you've got a 4 way polyhybrid
[02:15:40.780 --> 02:15:42.780]  you might end up with
[02:15:42.780 --> 02:15:44.780]  you know 8 different phenotypes
[02:15:44.780 --> 02:15:46.780]  or something and then you've got to decide
[02:15:46.780 --> 02:15:48.780]  what am I looking
[02:15:48.780 --> 02:15:50.780]  for what is the point
[02:15:50.780 --> 02:15:52.780]  of this line
[02:15:52.780 --> 02:15:54.780]  the point of a line
[02:15:54.780 --> 02:15:56.780]  to me you know lots of people
[02:15:56.780 --> 02:15:58.780]  it's all about preserving
[02:15:58.780 --> 02:16:00.780]  through population seeding
[02:16:00.780 --> 02:16:02.780]  and that is a valid
[02:16:02.780 --> 02:16:04.780]  thing to do in a
[02:16:04.780 --> 02:16:06.780]  conservation effort let's say
[02:16:06.780 --> 02:16:08.780]  in the
[02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:11.000]  but if you're breeding and you want to
[02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:13.000]  say this is this
[02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:15.000]  what is this you know
[02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:17.000]  is it purple is it green
[02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.000]  you know does it smell like
[02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:21.000]  jasmine or does it smell like oranges
[02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:23.000]  you know which is it
[02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:25.000]  as a breeder you've got to
[02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.000]  at some point you can't get
[02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:29.000]  away with just saying
[02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.000]  go pheno hunting and find your favorite
[02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:33.000]  you've got to say this seed
[02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:35.000]  reliably reproduces to give
[02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:37.000]  you lemons or whatever
[02:16:37.220 --> 02:16:39.220]  if it doesn't give you lemons
[02:16:39.220 --> 02:16:41.220]  don't call it lemons
[02:16:41.220 --> 02:16:43.220]  you've got to have
[02:16:43.220 --> 02:16:45.220]  a point to it at some level
[02:16:45.220 --> 02:16:47.220]  and everybody
[02:16:47.220 --> 02:16:49.220]  think of the
[02:16:49.220 --> 02:16:51.220]  when they talk about Shakespeare
[02:16:51.220 --> 02:16:53.220]  could be written by a million monkeys
[02:16:53.220 --> 02:16:55.220]  with typewriters or whatever
[02:16:55.220 --> 02:16:57.220]  and it's kind of like that
[02:16:57.220 --> 02:16:59.220]  and that's all of us hobby breeders
[02:16:59.220 --> 02:17:01.220]  that are working with limited resources
[02:17:01.220 --> 02:17:03.220]  and limited space
[02:17:03.220 --> 02:17:05.220]  and literally hiding to do it
[02:17:05.440 --> 02:17:07.440]  but still work got done
[02:17:07.440 --> 02:17:09.440]  you know you don't have to be
[02:17:09.440 --> 02:17:11.440]  a giant institute to breed good cannabis
[02:17:11.440 --> 02:17:13.440]  it's dudes like DJ
[02:17:13.440 --> 02:17:15.440]  in his closet that are
[02:17:15.440 --> 02:17:17.440]  preserving stuff
[02:17:17.440 --> 02:17:19.440]  at one level and advancing
[02:17:19.440 --> 02:17:21.440]  it on another
[02:17:21.440 --> 02:17:23.440]  so everybody's got a role
[02:17:23.440 --> 02:17:25.440]  to play you know
[02:17:25.440 --> 02:17:27.440]  it's great if you can do it on a great
[02:17:27.440 --> 02:17:29.440]  scale but do it however
[02:17:29.440 --> 02:17:31.440]  you can do it because
[02:17:31.440 --> 02:17:33.440]  you never know who's going to
[02:17:33.660 --> 02:17:35.660]  hit it lucky
[02:17:35.660 --> 02:17:37.660]  and find great stuff
[02:17:37.660 --> 02:17:39.660]  we all want to see it you know
[02:17:39.660 --> 02:17:41.660]  the more people
[02:17:41.660 --> 02:17:43.660]  breeding pot the better it is
[02:17:43.660 --> 02:17:45.660]  and even with the line selection
[02:17:45.660 --> 02:17:47.660]  a lot of it's like applicability
[02:17:47.660 --> 02:17:49.660]  because you can steer the direction
[02:17:49.660 --> 02:17:51.660]  depending on what the desire is
[02:17:51.660 --> 02:17:53.660]  and so
[02:17:53.660 --> 02:17:55.660]  things go in and out of fold
[02:17:55.660 --> 02:17:57.660]  and so you can move
[02:17:57.660 --> 02:17:59.660]  that's where I like interpretation
[02:17:59.660 --> 02:18:01.660]  where I try to understand
[02:18:01.880 --> 02:18:03.880]  what do we need to do with this thing
[02:18:03.880 --> 02:18:05.880]  so you're a breeder you're creating
[02:18:05.880 --> 02:18:07.880]  something where do we put it
[02:18:07.880 --> 02:18:09.880]  do we put it where
[02:18:09.880 --> 02:18:11.880]  and then who do we market it to
[02:18:11.880 --> 02:18:13.880]  and how do we capitalize on that
[02:18:13.880 --> 02:18:15.880]  and
[02:18:15.880 --> 02:18:17.880]  it allows you to be able to
[02:18:17.880 --> 02:18:19.880]  have people hold source material
[02:18:19.880 --> 02:18:21.880]  and then they can steer it over
[02:18:21.880 --> 02:18:23.880]  a couple year period where the swings
[02:18:23.880 --> 02:18:25.880]  become people want more gas
[02:18:25.880 --> 02:18:27.880]  they can move it subtly
[02:18:27.880 --> 02:18:29.880]  they can move it back into
[02:18:30.100 --> 02:18:32.100]  if you have a recessive dark
[02:18:32.100 --> 02:18:34.100]  and all of a sudden dark cannabis
[02:18:34.100 --> 02:18:36.100]  purple cannabis is back in vogue
[02:18:36.100 --> 02:18:38.100]  you go back into that line
[02:18:38.100 --> 02:18:40.100]  and you start to pull out that coloration
[02:18:40.100 --> 02:18:42.100]  so you can still move the line
[02:18:42.100 --> 02:18:44.100]  because the
[02:18:44.100 --> 02:18:46.100]  tastes of the consumer change
[02:18:46.100 --> 02:18:48.100]  and the market changes and it doesn't mean
[02:18:48.100 --> 02:18:50.100]  that it makes the line
[02:18:50.100 --> 02:18:52.100]  obsolete
[02:18:52.100 --> 02:18:54.100]  it has to just be reconfigured
[02:18:54.100 --> 02:18:56.100]  and that's where the breeder with good
[02:18:56.100 --> 02:18:58.100]  source material can maneuver
[02:18:58.320 --> 02:19:00.320]  and you have to hold the parents
[02:19:00.320 --> 02:19:02.320]  and I think that's where the problem
[02:19:02.320 --> 02:19:04.320]  with hobby breeders
[02:19:04.320 --> 02:19:06.320]  is that for all of us that were
[02:19:06.320 --> 02:19:08.320]  from the past we all really were
[02:19:08.320 --> 02:19:10.320]  limited through security
[02:19:10.320 --> 02:19:12.320]  of our stock
[02:19:12.320 --> 02:19:14.320]  you lost stuff to reeds constantly
[02:19:14.320 --> 02:19:16.320]  yeah and so like you in Switzerland
[02:19:16.320 --> 02:19:18.320]  I remember when Switzerland lit up
[02:19:18.320 --> 02:19:20.320]  and then I remember how many people
[02:19:20.320 --> 02:19:22.320]  got just hammered when the cantons
[02:19:22.320 --> 02:19:24.320]  changed their rules
[02:19:24.320 --> 02:19:26.320]  yeah every canton is different
[02:19:26.540 --> 02:19:28.540]  yep and it swung
[02:19:28.540 --> 02:19:30.540]  like a pendulum and depending was it
[02:19:30.540 --> 02:19:32.540]  hitting you in the head going left and then was it
[02:19:32.540 --> 02:19:34.540]  hitting you in the head going right
[02:19:34.540 --> 02:19:36.540]  I think we're in a really
[02:19:36.540 --> 02:19:38.540]  good time for cannabis right now because we have
[02:19:38.540 --> 02:19:40.540]  a lot of the old timers that are actually
[02:19:40.540 --> 02:19:42.540]  like opening up to the public but yet we
[02:19:42.540 --> 02:19:44.540]  still have a bunch of the new guys that are coming into the field
[02:19:44.540 --> 02:19:46.540]  being like man I smoked cookies in
[02:19:46.540 --> 02:19:48.540]  high school well I smoked haze and
[02:19:48.540 --> 02:19:50.540]  fucking like old school Afghani
[02:19:50.540 --> 02:19:52.540]  and shit like that in high school just the
[02:19:52.540 --> 02:19:54.540]  generation gap and now people actually
[02:19:54.760 --> 02:19:56.760]  able to talk and share strains
[02:19:56.760 --> 02:19:58.760]  I'm also the new stuff
[02:19:58.760 --> 02:20:00.760]  what's that
[02:20:00.760 --> 02:20:02.760]  I said I love all the new stuff
[02:20:02.760 --> 02:20:04.760]  but I've still got nostalgia for the old
[02:20:04.760 --> 02:20:06.760]  stuff too
[02:20:06.760 --> 02:20:08.760]  it's what we know I smoked all new grass
[02:20:08.760 --> 02:20:10.760]  I smoked all grass
[02:20:10.760 --> 02:20:12.760]  all the old stuff
[02:20:12.760 --> 02:20:14.760]  together to make the best new
[02:20:14.760 --> 02:20:16.760]  hybrids but again like some of the new shit
[02:20:16.760 --> 02:20:18.760]  again everybody's just going left to right to left
[02:20:18.760 --> 02:20:20.760]  to right to left so it's
[02:20:20.760 --> 02:20:22.760]  inconsistent but again like
[02:20:22.980 --> 02:20:24.980]  sometimes you find that firefeno but again
[02:20:24.980 --> 02:20:26.980]  you get a lot more consistencies
[02:20:26.980 --> 02:20:28.980]  with older genetics because there's not so much
[02:20:28.980 --> 02:20:30.980]  garbage bred into them there's not like
[02:20:30.980 --> 02:20:32.980]  oh this is a S1 and this was
[02:20:32.980 --> 02:20:34.980]  somebody's outdoor that had
[02:20:34.980 --> 02:20:36.980]  a male a couple yards from it
[02:20:36.980 --> 02:20:38.980]  it's like no you know exactly what it is now
[02:20:38.980 --> 02:20:40.980]  people stabilize things
[02:20:40.980 --> 02:20:42.980]  there wasn't many breeders but if there were breeders
[02:20:42.980 --> 02:20:44.980]  they would make something that was stable
[02:20:44.980 --> 02:20:46.980]  or they wouldn't call themselves breeders
[02:20:46.980 --> 02:20:48.980]  you know
[02:20:48.980 --> 02:20:50.980]  here in Humboldt
[02:20:51.200 --> 02:20:53.200]  that was popular back in the day
[02:20:53.200 --> 02:20:55.200]  I mean even just thinking about like a natural hermy
[02:20:55.200 --> 02:20:57.200]  I mean it's a girl that gets so stressed
[02:20:57.200 --> 02:20:59.200]  out she makes ovaries and
[02:20:59.200 --> 02:21:01.200]  then just had sex with herself to make a kid
[02:21:01.200 --> 02:21:03.200]  that's pretty fucked up when it comes
[02:21:03.200 --> 02:21:05.200]  to humans you know
[02:21:05.200 --> 02:21:07.200]  but not plants though plants are perfect
[02:21:07.200 --> 02:21:09.200]  exactly
[02:21:09.200 --> 02:21:11.200]  that's another reason why the great great great
[02:21:11.200 --> 02:21:13.200]  great great great great great granddad
[02:21:13.200 --> 02:21:15.200]  can have sex with the daughter
[02:21:15.200 --> 02:21:17.200]  but still produce an F9
[02:21:17.200 --> 02:21:19.200]  line
[02:21:19.420 --> 02:21:21.420]  everybody's eye color
[02:21:21.420 --> 02:21:23.420]  I can live with that but I'm killing the hermies
[02:21:23.420 --> 02:21:25.420]  I'm very intolerant of hermies
[02:21:25.420 --> 02:21:27.420]  yeah yeah no no no it has to be stable
[02:21:27.420 --> 02:21:29.420]  for production
[02:21:29.420 --> 02:21:31.420]  and some varieties like cherry pie
[02:21:31.420 --> 02:21:33.420]  right cherry pie is this
[02:21:33.420 --> 02:21:35.420]  it imparts quality to anything
[02:21:35.420 --> 02:21:37.420]  it touches but the breeders
[02:21:37.420 --> 02:21:39.420]  responsibility is to stress test
[02:21:39.420 --> 02:21:41.420]  all the plants before they release
[02:21:41.420 --> 02:21:43.420]  the cutting of that stock
[02:21:43.420 --> 02:21:45.420]  and
[02:21:45.420 --> 02:21:47.420]  exactly cherry pie grows straight up
[02:21:47.640 --> 02:21:49.640]  balls not even hermy parts straight balls
[02:21:49.640 --> 02:21:51.640]  from week 2 to 6 and they're like oh just
[02:21:51.640 --> 02:21:53.640]  hit a couple of things
[02:21:53.640 --> 02:21:55.640]  it depends on
[02:21:55.640 --> 02:21:57.640]  if you're growing it outdoor it doesn't
[02:21:57.640 --> 02:21:59.640]  you don't see the stress outside
[02:21:59.640 --> 02:22:01.640]  you see it indoor under electric light
[02:22:01.640 --> 02:22:03.640]  but for me I grow it outdoor
[02:22:03.640 --> 02:22:05.640]  every year and I have zero issues with it
[02:22:05.640 --> 02:22:07.640]  because it's in a natural
[02:22:07.640 --> 02:22:09.640]  form but when we transfer
[02:22:09.640 --> 02:22:11.640]  it is where we see the issue but
[02:22:11.640 --> 02:22:13.640]  that's like the same thing with like
[02:22:13.640 --> 02:22:15.640]  SR 71 purple cush like
[02:22:15.860 --> 02:22:17.860]  right now I'm growing it outdoors
[02:22:17.860 --> 02:22:19.860]  it likes to hermy like week 6 to 9
[02:22:19.860 --> 02:22:21.860]  outdoors has no problems
[02:22:21.860 --> 02:22:23.860]  but it's like got that straight up neon purple look to it
[02:22:23.860 --> 02:22:25.860]  it's really pretty
[02:22:25.860 --> 02:22:27.860]  Steve I'm curious
[02:22:27.860 --> 02:22:29.860]  when you were working
[02:22:29.860 --> 02:22:31.860]  lines and you get to the point
[02:22:31.860 --> 02:22:33.860]  where you had to pick a direction
[02:22:33.860 --> 02:22:35.860]  would there ever be a point
[02:22:35.860 --> 02:22:37.860]  or a line that you remember where you
[02:22:37.860 --> 02:22:39.860]  wanted to go two directions
[02:22:39.860 --> 02:22:41.860]  where there was two
[02:22:41.860 --> 02:22:43.860]  expressions worth keeping or three
[02:22:44.080 --> 02:22:46.080]  absolutely
[02:22:46.080 --> 02:22:48.080]  and even if you're line breeding
[02:22:48.080 --> 02:22:50.080]  pretty much by definition
[02:22:50.080 --> 02:22:52.080]  you have to keep two lines
[02:22:52.080 --> 02:22:54.080]  because what you do
[02:22:54.080 --> 02:22:56.080]  is cross them back to each other
[02:22:56.080 --> 02:22:58.080]  every three generations to avoid
[02:22:58.080 --> 02:23:00.080]  them getting inbred so you have to
[02:23:00.080 --> 02:23:02.080]  keep two lines at least
[02:23:02.080 --> 02:23:04.080]  and
[02:23:04.080 --> 02:23:06.080]  often would keep more
[02:23:06.080 --> 02:23:08.080]  because there would be certain things I'd like
[02:23:08.080 --> 02:23:10.080]  to about some over others you know
[02:23:10.080 --> 02:23:12.080]  like maybe this one had more
[02:23:12.300 --> 02:23:14.300]  of a grapey taste and a bit more color
[02:23:14.300 --> 02:23:16.300]  in the bud but this totally green
[02:23:16.300 --> 02:23:18.300]  one beside it was absolutely
[02:23:18.300 --> 02:23:20.300]  repelled mildew
[02:23:20.300 --> 02:23:22.300]  so it's like well I'm gonna keep
[02:23:22.300 --> 02:23:24.300]  the mildew repelled one but I'm gonna keep
[02:23:24.300 --> 02:23:26.300]  the one I love the taste of too you know
[02:23:26.300 --> 02:23:28.300]  and after they're
[02:23:28.300 --> 02:23:30.300]  stable enough they can meet each other again
[02:23:30.300 --> 02:23:32.300]  you know
[02:23:32.300 --> 02:23:34.300]  so the keeping lines for traits
[02:23:34.300 --> 02:23:36.300]  that are complementary is really
[02:23:36.300 --> 02:23:41.810]  important
[02:23:41.810 --> 02:23:43.810]  so we got a lot of questions
[02:23:44.030 --> 02:23:46.030]  so I have a question
[02:23:46.030 --> 02:23:48.030]  so really
[02:23:48.030 --> 02:23:50.030]  Kevin and Steve you guys have never met
[02:23:50.030 --> 02:23:52.030]  before till now
[02:23:52.030 --> 02:23:54.030]  you both have been working in Columbia right?
[02:23:54.030 --> 02:23:56.030]  that's like saying we both
[02:23:56.030 --> 02:23:58.030]  work in the US
[02:23:58.030 --> 02:24:00.030]  I know but I just assumed
[02:24:00.030 --> 02:24:02.030]  you guys are such like awesome breeders
[02:24:02.030 --> 02:24:04.030]  and like you guys
[02:24:04.030 --> 02:24:06.030]  no no I've just known Steve's work
[02:24:06.030 --> 02:24:08.030]  forever
[02:24:08.030 --> 02:24:10.030]  yeah no I've known Steve's work forever
[02:24:10.030 --> 02:24:12.030]  I've just known him for a long time
[02:24:12.250 --> 02:24:14.250]  I was over
[02:24:14.250 --> 02:24:16.250]  in Vashada and then I was
[02:24:16.250 --> 02:24:18.250]  outside of Bogota so both of those
[02:24:18.250 --> 02:24:20.250]  regions where I spent time
[02:24:20.250 --> 02:24:22.250]  same thing is that
[02:24:22.250 --> 02:24:24.250]  I've known who you were forever
[02:24:24.250 --> 02:24:26.250]  and I ran your stock I said I got
[02:24:26.250 --> 02:24:28.250]  a hold of some of that grapefruit
[02:24:28.250 --> 02:24:30.250]  I was thinking late 80s but early 90s is when I
[02:24:30.250 --> 02:24:32.250]  went over and connected with Mark Emery's group
[02:24:32.250 --> 02:24:34.250]  and so I went over there
[02:24:34.250 --> 02:24:36.250]  and Emery had just got grabbed
[02:24:36.250 --> 02:24:38.250]  and got tossed and I tied in
[02:24:38.250 --> 02:24:40.250]  with all the crew that was around him
[02:24:40.470 --> 02:24:42.470]  and that's when I got a hold of the grapefruit
[02:24:42.470 --> 02:24:44.470]  I got a hold of that island sweet skunk
[02:24:44.470 --> 02:24:46.470]  and then
[02:24:46.470 --> 02:24:48.470]  a year or two later I get a hold
[02:24:48.470 --> 02:24:50.470]  of the sweet tooth
[02:24:50.470 --> 02:24:52.470]  and then you do that collaboration
[02:24:52.470 --> 02:24:54.470]  with Red from Legends and I get a hold of your
[02:24:54.470 --> 02:24:56.470]  Ortega, the Ortega sweet tooth
[02:24:56.470 --> 02:24:58.470]  which is that Legend's open indigo
[02:24:58.470 --> 02:25:00.470]  that was killer here
[02:25:00.470 --> 02:25:02.470]  I throw those fucking donks man
[02:25:02.470 --> 02:25:04.470]  good weed
[02:25:04.470 --> 02:25:06.470]  I gotta mute
[02:25:06.470 --> 02:25:08.470]  myself for a second
[02:25:10.470 --> 02:25:12.470]  Steve's getting another beer
[02:25:12.470 --> 02:25:14.470]  Steve everyone's cheering you on
[02:25:14.470 --> 02:25:16.470]  with your champion
[02:25:20.470 --> 02:25:22.470]  so there were
[02:25:22.470 --> 02:25:24.470]  a couple like kind of like
[02:25:24.470 --> 02:25:26.470]  what
[02:25:26.470 --> 02:25:28.470]  pests or pathogens
[02:25:28.470 --> 02:25:30.470]  are
[02:25:30.470 --> 02:25:32.470]  seasonally around this year
[02:25:32.470 --> 02:25:34.470]  so
[02:25:34.470 --> 02:25:36.470]  Flavor Craver 420
[02:25:36.470 --> 02:25:38.470]  he's like
[02:25:38.690 --> 02:25:40.690]  powdery mildew has been the issue this year
[02:25:40.690 --> 02:25:42.690]  for him or her bugs haven't
[02:25:42.690 --> 02:25:44.690]  been too bad for me
[02:25:44.690 --> 02:25:46.690]  then people talk
[02:25:46.690 --> 02:25:48.690]  about someone said or the same person said
[02:25:48.690 --> 02:25:50.690]  like having thrips
[02:25:50.690 --> 02:25:52.690]  like having bugs during
[02:25:52.690 --> 02:25:54.690]  veg like
[02:25:54.690 --> 02:25:56.690]  you know puts hair on their chest
[02:25:56.690 --> 02:25:58.690]  so anyway what
[02:25:58.690 --> 02:26:00.690]  are the bugs you're seeing this season
[02:26:00.690 --> 02:26:02.690]  versus this season
[02:26:02.690 --> 02:26:04.690]  well this season's kind of different
[02:26:04.690 --> 02:26:06.690]  where like you're still seeing rust
[02:26:06.910 --> 02:26:08.910]  besides cows
[02:26:08.910 --> 02:26:10.910]  yeah the cows
[02:26:10.910 --> 02:26:12.910]  the rust and mites are still popping up
[02:26:12.910 --> 02:26:14.910]  we still see those little pop ups but they're pretty
[02:26:14.910 --> 02:26:16.910]  easy to control
[02:26:16.910 --> 02:26:18.910]  if you're doing full outdoor you don't see aphids
[02:26:18.910 --> 02:26:20.910]  but man if you're doing any kind of
[02:26:20.910 --> 02:26:22.910]  indoor or mixed light
[02:26:22.910 --> 02:26:24.910]  under hoop
[02:26:24.910 --> 02:26:26.910]  holy shit aphids took over California
[02:26:26.910 --> 02:26:28.910]  and then I was up
[02:26:28.910 --> 02:26:30.910]  at a farm the other day and there was up in
[02:26:30.910 --> 02:26:32.910]  Palo Verde Harris area
[02:26:32.910 --> 02:26:34.910]  and they had a lot of leaf miners
[02:26:35.130 --> 02:26:37.130]  and so the leaf miners
[02:26:37.130 --> 02:26:39.130]  are having a similar effect as russets
[02:26:39.130 --> 02:26:41.130]  where their
[02:26:41.130 --> 02:26:43.130]  attack on the leaf
[02:26:43.130 --> 02:26:45.130]  leaves some form of toxin
[02:26:45.130 --> 02:26:47.130]  and it gives it this crazy swirl
[02:26:47.130 --> 02:26:49.130]  leaf and changes the
[02:26:49.130 --> 02:26:51.130]  the plants
[02:26:51.130 --> 02:26:53.130]  vitality tremendously
[02:26:53.130 --> 02:26:55.130]  so from what I'm seeing is really
[02:26:55.130 --> 02:26:57.130]  this year I would say you know aphids are your
[02:26:57.130 --> 02:26:59.130]  number one large problem
[02:26:59.130 --> 02:27:01.130]  for most cultivators and then
[02:27:01.130 --> 02:27:03.130]  the leaf miners seem to be
[02:27:03.350 --> 02:27:05.350]  popping up too
[02:27:05.350 --> 02:27:07.350]  and then you still see russet populations
[02:27:07.350 --> 02:27:09.350]  but I'm not seeing
[02:27:09.350 --> 02:27:11.350]  any kind of we're having such a
[02:27:11.350 --> 02:27:13.350]  hot dry
[02:27:13.350 --> 02:27:15.350]  situation that you're not seeing any of the
[02:27:15.350 --> 02:27:17.350]  spikes yet so
[02:27:17.350 --> 02:27:19.350]  and I think PM
[02:27:19.350 --> 02:27:21.350]  to me I've always said this too
[02:27:21.350 --> 02:27:23.350]  is that a lot of the reasons why I think you see PM
[02:27:23.350 --> 02:27:25.350]  is because your plants
[02:27:25.350 --> 02:27:27.350]  are overfed and so what
[02:27:27.350 --> 02:27:29.350]  we do is we drive the plants
[02:27:29.350 --> 02:27:31.350]  to get weight and the problem
[02:27:31.570 --> 02:27:33.570]  is that when you put too much sugar into them
[02:27:33.570 --> 02:27:35.570]  they're producing too much sap
[02:27:35.570 --> 02:27:37.570]  and it makes them extremely attractive
[02:27:37.570 --> 02:27:39.570]  to pathogens and so
[02:27:39.570 --> 02:27:41.570]  there's this line you have to walk
[02:27:41.570 --> 02:27:43.570]  of enough weight but not too much
[02:27:43.570 --> 02:27:45.570]  because ultimately however big the fucking
[02:27:45.570 --> 02:27:47.570]  plant was I could care less
[02:27:47.570 --> 02:27:49.570]  what I care is how much is in the bag
[02:27:49.570 --> 02:27:51.570]  so it's pot sold
[02:27:51.570 --> 02:27:53.570]  matters to me not pot grown
[02:27:53.570 --> 02:27:55.570]  so if I grow a ton
[02:27:55.570 --> 02:27:57.570]  and I sell an ounce
[02:27:57.570 --> 02:27:59.570]  it didn't go well
[02:27:59.790 --> 02:28:01.790]  I could grow a hundred pounds and sell a hundred pounds
[02:28:01.790 --> 02:28:03.790]  and have to call 20, 30, 40, 50%
[02:28:03.790 --> 02:28:05.790]  of my crop to rot
[02:28:05.790 --> 02:28:07.790]  and I think that so much
[02:28:07.790 --> 02:28:09.790]  with fungal issues
[02:28:09.790 --> 02:28:11.790]  it's always about the fact
[02:28:11.790 --> 02:28:13.790]  that the plant's a smorgasbord
[02:28:13.790 --> 02:28:15.790]  if it's attractive
[02:28:15.790 --> 02:28:17.790]  and I think that what happens is that you overload
[02:28:17.790 --> 02:28:19.790]  the plant so heavy that it
[02:28:19.790 --> 02:28:21.790]  becomes too sugary and it's
[02:28:21.790 --> 02:28:23.790]  imbalanced and I had a phrase for it
[02:28:23.790 --> 02:28:25.790]  called plant obesity
[02:28:25.790 --> 02:28:27.790]  and it just made the plant extremely
[02:28:28.010 --> 02:28:30.010]  attractive to pests and fungus
[02:28:30.010 --> 02:28:32.010]  and when I started
[02:28:32.010 --> 02:28:34.010]  trying to back off on how hard
[02:28:34.010 --> 02:28:36.010]  I drove them I noticed
[02:28:36.010 --> 02:28:38.010]  that I dropped that PM right out
[02:28:38.010 --> 02:28:40.010]  of my operations
[02:28:40.010 --> 02:28:42.010]  where some varieties are just prone
[02:28:42.010 --> 02:28:44.010]  you gotta cull them
[02:28:44.010 --> 02:28:46.010]  if it is problematic don't nurse it
[02:28:46.010 --> 02:28:48.010]  grow it in your yard for yourself
[02:28:48.010 --> 02:28:50.010]  have it as your special little
[02:28:50.010 --> 02:28:52.010]  treat but if that shit's
[02:28:52.010 --> 02:28:54.010]  fragile as a farmer you can't run it
[02:28:54.010 --> 02:28:56.010]  and have any kind of security
[02:28:56.230 --> 02:28:58.230]  and because they charge you so much money
[02:28:58.230 --> 02:29:00.230]  for your permits
[02:29:00.230 --> 02:29:02.230]  a fixed cost, you can't get away from the fixed cost
[02:29:02.230 --> 02:29:04.230]  variable costs we can work with
[02:29:04.230 --> 02:29:06.230]  production levels can go up and down
[02:29:06.230 --> 02:29:08.230]  if I grow more it costs more
[02:29:08.230 --> 02:29:10.230]  but on permits it's fixed
[02:29:10.230 --> 02:29:12.230]  this size canopy is this much
[02:29:12.230 --> 02:29:14.230]  this size is this much
[02:29:14.230 --> 02:29:16.230]  water is this much
[02:29:16.230 --> 02:29:18.230]  if you're water bored, so for me I have a fixed cost
[02:29:18.230 --> 02:29:20.230]  of 40 grand just to turn the farm on
[02:29:20.230 --> 02:29:22.230]  right?
[02:29:22.230 --> 02:29:24.230]  that means that in the US
[02:29:24.450 --> 02:29:26.450]  I'd have to make about 70,000
[02:29:26.450 --> 02:29:28.450]  little under 70
[02:29:28.450 --> 02:29:30.450]  to take home 40k after taxes
[02:29:30.450 --> 02:29:32.450]  so I have to have a 70,000 dollar a year job
[02:29:32.450 --> 02:29:34.450]  where I work for 365 days
[02:29:34.450 --> 02:29:36.450]  in a fiscal year
[02:29:36.450 --> 02:29:38.450]  in that period, 50 weeks to the 52
[02:29:38.450 --> 02:29:40.450]  just to make the money
[02:29:40.450 --> 02:29:42.450]  required to turn a farm on
[02:29:42.450 --> 02:29:44.450]  so when you put it in English like that
[02:29:44.450 --> 02:29:46.450]  you gotta be really really clear
[02:29:46.450 --> 02:29:48.450]  about what it is you're doing
[02:29:48.450 --> 02:29:50.450]  and so to me I'm not trying to get the
[02:29:50.450 --> 02:29:52.450]  biggest plants I'm trying to get the most
[02:29:52.670 --> 02:29:54.670]  off the plant to the end user
[02:29:54.670 --> 02:29:56.670]  within reason
[02:29:56.670 --> 02:29:58.670]  and once I kind of change
[02:29:58.670 --> 02:30:00.670]  that idea that I was going to get
[02:30:00.670 --> 02:30:02.670]  less on the stick but more
[02:30:02.670 --> 02:30:04.670]  in the bag relatively
[02:30:04.670 --> 02:30:06.670]  my fungal problems decrease dramatically
[02:30:06.670 --> 02:30:08.670]  and so I think
[02:30:08.670 --> 02:30:10.670]  that you can really work with that
[02:30:10.670 --> 02:30:12.670]  in a lot better fashion and I think that
[02:30:12.670 --> 02:30:14.670]  once you get the plant balanced
[02:30:14.670 --> 02:30:16.670]  it's not as attractive to the pests
[02:30:16.670 --> 02:30:18.670]  either
[02:30:18.670 --> 02:30:20.670]  so once everything's pretty good
[02:30:20.890 --> 02:30:22.890]  they're more resistant
[02:30:22.890 --> 02:30:24.890]  you go to Columbia, if you want to see a problem
[02:30:24.890 --> 02:30:26.890]  go to Columbia and see thrips
[02:30:26.890 --> 02:30:28.890]  because these fucking things look like hummingbirds
[02:30:28.890 --> 02:30:30.890]  coming down out of the sky
[02:30:30.890 --> 02:30:32.890]  they're Jurassic
[02:30:32.890 --> 02:30:34.890]  the big brother
[02:30:34.890 --> 02:30:36.890]  there's a whole lot of other problems
[02:30:36.890 --> 02:30:38.890]  yes
[02:30:38.890 --> 02:30:40.890]  there's all these other issues
[02:30:40.890 --> 02:30:42.890]  but here in California right now
[02:30:42.890 --> 02:30:44.890]  this year, every operation I go to
[02:30:44.890 --> 02:30:46.890]  that's having any kind of pest problem
[02:30:46.890 --> 02:30:48.890]  if it's an aphid, it's in an indoor
[02:30:49.110 --> 02:30:51.110]  or it's in a greenhouse
[02:30:51.110 --> 02:30:53.110]  and it is so
[02:30:53.110 --> 02:30:55.110]  aggressive in its reproduction
[02:30:55.110 --> 02:30:57.110]  that you can't control it
[02:30:57.110 --> 02:30:59.110]  once it's in your nursery
[02:30:59.110 --> 02:31:01.110]  it moves through the operation
[02:31:01.110 --> 02:31:03.110]  and so you have to be able
[02:31:03.110 --> 02:31:05.110]  to get yourself starting clean
[02:31:05.110 --> 02:31:07.110]  and make sure
[02:31:07.110 --> 02:31:09.110]  that your canopy isn't so
[02:31:09.110 --> 02:31:11.110]  connected and so
[02:31:11.110 --> 02:31:13.110]  congregated that you can't get any
[02:31:13.110 --> 02:31:15.110]  kind of controls
[02:31:15.110 --> 02:31:17.110]  and once you have the problem
[02:31:17.330 --> 02:31:19.330]  you can't re-inoculate beneficials
[02:31:19.330 --> 02:31:21.330]  into the space
[02:31:21.330 --> 02:31:23.330]  everybody tells you ladybugs and shit, they fly out
[02:31:23.330 --> 02:31:25.330]  it's green lacewings that work well
[02:31:25.330 --> 02:31:27.330]  lacewings work really well for this
[02:31:27.330 --> 02:31:29.330]  but you've got to grow them up as larva
[02:31:29.330 --> 02:31:31.330]  you put them in as an adult
[02:31:31.330 --> 02:31:33.330]  so you need to get a billion of them
[02:31:33.330 --> 02:31:35.330]  and then you're having to put them into a grid
[02:31:35.330 --> 02:31:37.330]  and then allow them to move in
[02:31:37.330 --> 02:31:39.330]  and by the time they mature and start to eat
[02:31:39.330 --> 02:31:41.330]  the aphids out reproduce them
[02:31:41.330 --> 02:31:43.330]  so you've got to get
[02:31:43.330 --> 02:31:45.330]  the population brought down
[02:31:45.550 --> 02:31:47.550]  and then you've got to deploy
[02:31:47.550 --> 02:31:49.550]  you bring in the beneficials
[02:31:49.550 --> 02:31:51.550]  and a lot of that is just starting
[02:31:51.550 --> 02:31:53.550]  from your source material
[02:31:53.550 --> 02:31:55.550]  and for a lot of these operations
[02:31:55.550 --> 02:31:57.550]  what they do is they run their own nurseries
[02:31:57.550 --> 02:31:59.550]  and when I go to the operation
[02:31:59.550 --> 02:32:01.550]  I'm always like look
[02:32:01.550 --> 02:32:03.550]  your whole place is contaminated
[02:32:03.550 --> 02:32:05.550]  just take me to the nursery first
[02:32:05.550 --> 02:32:07.550]  and let's find it
[02:32:07.550 --> 02:32:09.550]  and then you can find the clusters under the leaves
[02:32:09.550 --> 02:32:11.550]  and you're like you've got a problem
[02:32:11.550 --> 02:32:13.550]  because I'm telling you man
[02:32:13.770 --> 02:32:15.770]  holy christ I swear to god they're born pregnant
[02:32:15.770 --> 02:32:17.770]  you know what
[02:32:17.770 --> 02:32:19.770]  I did it on the green weed to get rid of them
[02:32:19.770 --> 02:32:21.770]  these root aphids
[02:32:21.770 --> 02:32:23.770]  that are now hemp aphids
[02:32:23.770 --> 02:32:25.770]  I ran two acres last year we did like 2,500 plants
[02:32:25.770 --> 02:32:27.770]  it seems like they just like
[02:32:27.770 --> 02:32:29.770]  once the ladybugs
[02:32:29.770 --> 02:32:31.770]  end their reproductive cycle
[02:32:31.770 --> 02:32:33.770]  and the eggs are ready to hatch
[02:32:33.770 --> 02:32:35.770]  the aphids try to move in
[02:32:35.770 --> 02:32:37.770]  and then they try to kind of sweep through your crop
[02:32:37.770 --> 02:32:39.770]  but we've tried essential oils
[02:32:39.770 --> 02:32:41.770]  soaps, sulfurs
[02:32:41.990 --> 02:32:43.990]  and vegetable oil
[02:32:43.990 --> 02:32:45.990]  and vegetative state obviously
[02:32:45.990 --> 02:32:47.990]  the thing that seemed to work the very best
[02:32:47.990 --> 02:32:49.990]  was just straight up hard pressured water
[02:32:49.990 --> 02:32:51.990]  to get them off the plant
[02:32:51.990 --> 02:32:53.990]  once they let go they die
[02:32:53.990 --> 02:32:55.990]  russets
[02:32:55.990 --> 02:32:57.990]  I've been growing in northern California
[02:32:57.990 --> 02:32:59.990]  for a long time now
[02:32:59.990 --> 02:33:01.990]  it gets very very hot where I'm at
[02:33:01.990 --> 02:33:03.990]  it gets up to like 120 degrees
[02:33:03.990 --> 02:33:05.990]  I've seen russets run through 99 plant gardens
[02:33:05.990 --> 02:33:07.990]  and kill that shit within two weeks
[02:33:07.990 --> 02:33:09.990]  we ran into them about 2012
[02:33:10.210 --> 02:33:12.210]  they need a lot of sulfur
[02:33:12.210 --> 02:33:14.210]  they need a direct contact
[02:33:14.210 --> 02:33:16.210]  they need to be touched
[02:33:16.210 --> 02:33:18.210]  so if you start going into flower
[02:33:18.210 --> 02:33:20.210]  right before your THC and everything else shows up
[02:33:20.210 --> 02:33:22.210]  I like to give them a nice thick layer of sulfur
[02:33:22.210 --> 02:33:24.210]  that way all the new growth comes completely out of it
[02:33:24.210 --> 02:33:26.210]  it doesn't actually touch any of the flowers at all
[02:33:26.210 --> 02:33:28.210]  but it needs to be a direct contact killer
[02:33:28.210 --> 02:33:30.210]  for those guys
[02:33:30.210 --> 02:33:32.210]  those guys breed like 81 times a day
[02:33:32.210 --> 02:33:34.210]  or some shit
[02:33:34.210 --> 02:33:36.210]  the other aphids breed like 6 or 8 times a day
[02:33:36.210 --> 02:33:38.210]  and you're right they are born pregnant
[02:33:38.430 --> 02:33:40.430]  we've tried super high pressure
[02:33:40.430 --> 02:33:42.430]  with oil, soap, sulfur
[02:33:42.430 --> 02:33:44.430]  pretty much nothing works
[02:33:44.430 --> 02:33:46.430]  if they are hanging on to the plant
[02:33:46.430 --> 02:33:48.430]  they're still going to breed
[02:33:48.430 --> 02:33:50.430]  but if you can get them to let go
[02:33:50.430 --> 02:33:52.430]  they die
[02:33:52.430 --> 02:33:54.430]  and I thought Justin Calvino
[02:33:54.430 --> 02:33:56.430]  was prolific in the procreation
[02:33:56.430 --> 02:33:58.430]  that's funny he's got like 8 kids
[02:33:58.430 --> 02:34:00.430]  it's tough when you're good looking
[02:34:00.430 --> 02:34:02.430]  my boy Pedro
[02:34:02.430 --> 02:34:04.430]  has got like 8 kids too
[02:34:04.430 --> 02:34:06.430]  but for me
[02:34:06.650 --> 02:34:08.650]  we don't see russet issues
[02:34:08.650 --> 02:34:10.650]  until first of August
[02:34:10.650 --> 02:34:12.650]  pretty much here in our area
[02:34:12.650 --> 02:34:14.650]  and that's when the thrips come in too
[02:34:14.650 --> 02:34:16.650]  so I use
[02:34:16.650 --> 02:34:18.650]  californicus mites
[02:34:18.650 --> 02:34:20.650]  and I just put a couple sachets on every plant
[02:34:20.650 --> 02:34:22.650]  as a prophylactic
[02:34:22.650 --> 02:34:24.650]  in early July
[02:34:24.650 --> 02:34:26.650]  we're using the californicus, streptomyces
[02:34:26.650 --> 02:34:28.650]  and the necropolis
[02:34:28.650 --> 02:34:30.650]  I'm about to colonize
[02:34:30.650 --> 02:34:32.650]  yeah the necropolis
[02:34:32.650 --> 02:34:34.650]  ambrosones
[02:34:34.870 --> 02:34:36.870]  where are you at in Cali?
[02:34:36.870 --> 02:34:38.870]  the farm I worked at last year
[02:34:38.870 --> 02:34:40.870]  was around Santa Rosa area
[02:34:40.870 --> 02:34:42.870]  but I'm more like Shasta area
[02:34:42.870 --> 02:34:44.870]  yeah so you're in the heat too
[02:34:44.870 --> 02:34:46.870]  a lot of the beneficials
[02:34:46.870 --> 02:34:48.870]  that we use can't take the climate
[02:34:48.870 --> 02:34:50.870]  where the californicus can take that outdoor climate
[02:34:50.870 --> 02:34:52.870]  and the dry
[02:34:52.870 --> 02:34:54.870]  nothing else will survive in the low humidity
[02:34:54.870 --> 02:34:56.870]  because our humidity will get down to like 15%
[02:34:56.870 --> 02:34:58.870]  going back to the
[02:34:58.870 --> 02:35:00.870]  powdery mildew issue
[02:35:00.870 --> 02:35:02.870]  last year we ran into
[02:35:03.090 --> 02:35:05.090]  we got clones from all kinds of different sources
[02:35:05.090 --> 02:35:07.090]  dude we had cuts
[02:35:07.090 --> 02:35:09.090]  that came in with thrips
[02:35:09.090 --> 02:35:11.090]  two different kinds of mites
[02:35:11.090 --> 02:35:13.090]  wait can I stop you for one second
[02:35:13.090 --> 02:35:15.090]  when you
[02:35:15.090 --> 02:35:17.090]  started with we had cuts coming in
[02:35:17.090 --> 02:35:19.090]  from all sorts of places
[02:35:19.090 --> 02:35:21.090]  I was eager to see where this was going to go
[02:35:21.090 --> 02:35:23.090]  so go for it
[02:35:23.090 --> 02:35:25.090]  they got them from a really shitty location
[02:35:25.090 --> 02:35:27.090]  and the boss was super proud
[02:35:27.090 --> 02:35:29.090]  look at how good these look
[02:35:29.090 --> 02:35:31.090]  started looking at them
[02:35:31.310 --> 02:35:33.310]  straight up later on we got
[02:35:33.310 --> 02:35:35.310]  laboratory tested fesarium
[02:35:35.310 --> 02:35:37.310]  two different kinds of powdery mildew
[02:35:37.310 --> 02:35:39.310]  russets, thrips, and two different kinds of mites
[02:35:39.310 --> 02:35:41.310]  I was like dude
[02:35:41.310 --> 02:35:43.310]  you had to try to get all these at the same time
[02:35:43.310 --> 02:35:45.310]  what the fuck is going on
[02:35:45.310 --> 02:35:47.310]  but dude we wiped out
[02:35:47.310 --> 02:35:49.310]  everything whenever we had russets
[02:35:49.310 --> 02:35:51.310]  at one little point so what I like to do
[02:35:51.310 --> 02:35:53.310]  for russets, russets start at the bottom of the plant
[02:35:53.310 --> 02:35:55.310]  bottom middle of the plant
[02:35:55.310 --> 02:35:57.310]  they start eating your suckers
[02:35:57.310 --> 02:35:59.310]  so if you can actually leave just a handful of suckers
[02:35:59.530 --> 02:36:01.530]  at the very bottom of your plant
[02:36:01.530 --> 02:36:03.530]  that will give you an actual physical identification
[02:36:03.530 --> 02:36:05.530]  if they are starting to get eaten or not
[02:36:05.530 --> 02:36:07.530]  but once
[02:36:07.530 --> 02:36:09.530]  they hit the tip of that branch
[02:36:09.530 --> 02:36:11.530]  just cut that branch off and it's not going to come back
[02:36:11.530 --> 02:36:13.530]  if it does, it actually
[02:36:13.530 --> 02:36:15.530]  they have a bacteria in their mouth
[02:36:15.530 --> 02:36:17.530]  that actually damages the soft tissue of the plant
[02:36:17.530 --> 02:36:19.530]  so when it reaches the top of the plant
[02:36:19.530 --> 02:36:21.530]  they go and then it looks like
[02:36:21.530 --> 02:36:23.530]  they are trying to revert but the leaves are really
[02:36:23.530 --> 02:36:25.530]  crinkled and almost queued up looking
[02:36:25.530 --> 02:36:27.530]  they will miss serrations
[02:36:27.750 --> 02:36:29.750]  it's going to grow funky
[02:36:29.750 --> 02:36:31.750]  for a month and a half to three months
[02:36:31.750 --> 02:36:33.750]  if you are outdoors, cut off
[02:36:33.750 --> 02:36:35.750]  the damage or scrap the plant
[02:36:35.750 --> 02:36:37.750]  again, keep that separated
[02:36:37.750 --> 02:36:39.750]  put that shit in a bag
[02:36:39.750 --> 02:36:41.750]  spray the fuck out of it with some sulfur
[02:36:41.750 --> 02:36:43.750]  real heavy because again you are not going to use it
[02:36:43.750 --> 02:36:45.750]  and go wash your hands really fucking well
[02:36:45.750 --> 02:36:47.750]  the powdery mildew
[02:36:47.750 --> 02:36:49.750]  powdery mildew
[02:36:49.750 --> 02:36:51.750]  we found out there are 16 different species of powdery mildew
[02:36:51.750 --> 02:36:53.750]  back in the day you used to be able to use
[02:36:53.750 --> 02:36:55.750]  what was that one that smelled
[02:36:55.970 --> 02:36:57.970]  like feet
[02:36:57.970 --> 02:36:59.970]  it was in a bright pink bottle
[02:36:59.970 --> 02:37:01.970]  but everybody used to use
[02:37:01.970 --> 02:37:03.970]  that one back in the day, I don't even remember what it is now
[02:37:03.970 --> 02:37:05.970]  but literally now there is
[02:37:05.970 --> 02:37:07.970]  each bacilli species to combat
[02:37:07.970 --> 02:37:09.970]  different species of powdery mildew
[02:37:09.970 --> 02:37:11.970]  what powdery mildew does is it actually
[02:37:11.970 --> 02:37:13.970]  puts a footnote in your leaf, it actually puts
[02:37:13.970 --> 02:37:15.970]  a little claw inside your leaf
[02:37:15.970 --> 02:37:17.970]  and it stays there, so if it's an older
[02:37:17.970 --> 02:37:19.970]  genetic, more than likely it has it
[02:37:19.970 --> 02:37:21.970]  because somebody brought it indoors at one point and got
[02:37:21.970 --> 02:37:23.970]  powdery mildew and it spread
[02:37:24.190 --> 02:37:26.190]  if they tissue culture it
[02:37:26.190 --> 02:37:28.190]  the tissue culture comes out clean
[02:37:28.190 --> 02:37:30.190]  but the old cut, it has a footnote
[02:37:30.190 --> 02:37:32.190]  even if you have it in your indoor garden or outdoor garden
[02:37:32.190 --> 02:37:34.190]  as long as your
[02:37:34.190 --> 02:37:36.190]  environment is under control
[02:37:36.190 --> 02:37:38.190]  under 60% humidity and you have good air flow
[02:37:38.190 --> 02:37:40.190]  the powdery mildew
[02:37:40.190 --> 02:37:42.190]  will try to recede
[02:37:42.190 --> 02:37:44.190]  but the second you get a spike in your
[02:37:44.190 --> 02:37:46.190]  humidity it just tries to breed
[02:37:46.190 --> 02:37:48.190]  so it will actually, if you get a cut from a buddy
[02:37:48.190 --> 02:37:50.190]  he doesn't have powdery mildew and all of a sudden you get it like crazy
[02:37:50.190 --> 02:37:52.190]  your room is off
[02:37:52.410 --> 02:37:54.410]  but again
[02:37:54.410 --> 02:37:56.410]  there's different species of bacilli
[02:37:56.410 --> 02:37:58.410]  that actually combat it
[02:37:58.410 --> 02:38:00.410]  there's a product by bioscience
[02:38:00.410 --> 02:38:02.410]  called Armory, it actually has
[02:38:02.410 --> 02:38:04.410]  the four major species of bacilli
[02:38:04.410 --> 02:38:06.410]  in it, it does not have lactobacillus
[02:38:06.410 --> 02:38:08.410]  but it actually eats
[02:38:08.410 --> 02:38:10.410]  powdery mildew and it will actually live on the leaf
[02:38:10.410 --> 02:38:12.410]  surface and really try to rid it
[02:38:12.410 --> 02:38:14.410]  like literally you spray it one time
[02:38:14.410 --> 02:38:16.410]  and it's like, cool this is food
[02:38:16.410 --> 02:38:18.410]  but again it's such small
[02:38:18.410 --> 02:38:20.410]  microbial count that it's not going to help you
[02:38:20.630 --> 02:38:22.630]  it's not going to make you fail tests for
[02:38:22.630 --> 02:38:24.630]  microbes
[02:38:24.630 --> 02:38:26.630]  yeah it won't test hot
[02:38:26.630 --> 02:38:28.630]  no
[02:38:28.630 --> 02:38:30.630]  right now
[02:38:30.630 --> 02:38:32.630]  we have a real problem with all this ash in the air
[02:38:32.630 --> 02:38:34.630]  they're going to be testing high for yeast because it's going to be inside
[02:38:34.630 --> 02:38:36.630]  their buds
[02:38:36.630 --> 02:38:38.630]  we see plants here in California that are resistant
[02:38:38.630 --> 02:38:40.630]  but if they're on the east coast they're not
[02:38:40.630 --> 02:38:42.630]  because it's a different resistance
[02:38:42.630 --> 02:38:44.630]  for that strain of bacteria
[02:38:44.630 --> 02:38:46.630]  I feel like there's a lot more
[02:38:46.630 --> 02:38:48.630]  indoor growers in California
[02:38:48.850 --> 02:38:50.850]  they just bring them inside and certain people don't know
[02:38:50.850 --> 02:38:52.850]  what to do so they end up getting it
[02:38:52.850 --> 02:38:54.850]  and then it just keeps, it just always stays around
[02:38:54.850 --> 02:38:56.850]  or it's in their ground rooms and it
[02:38:56.850 --> 02:38:58.850]  attaches itself to like a piece of wood
[02:38:58.850 --> 02:39:00.850]  that's soft and that spore just lives
[02:39:00.850 --> 02:39:02.850]  on that piece of wood without you seeing it
[02:39:02.850 --> 02:39:04.850]  if you visibly see powdery mildew
[02:39:04.850 --> 02:39:06.850]  it's already been breeding on the plant for two weeks
[02:39:06.850 --> 02:39:08.850]  they had it in all the rooms that used to have sheetrock
[02:39:08.850 --> 02:39:10.850]  it gets in the gypsum
[02:39:10.850 --> 02:39:12.850]  yeah so again
[02:39:12.850 --> 02:39:14.850]  when they were using gypsum
[02:39:14.850 --> 02:39:16.850]  behind the impermeable coating
[02:39:17.070 --> 02:39:19.070]  the problem was that it would get into the gypsum
[02:39:19.070 --> 02:39:21.070]  and it would become a
[02:39:21.070 --> 02:39:23.070]  habitat
[02:39:23.070 --> 02:39:25.070]  so that's when they started really going into all inert
[02:39:25.070 --> 02:39:27.070]  material completely on indoor operations
[02:39:27.070 --> 02:39:29.070]  but for me I just noticed
[02:39:29.070 --> 02:39:31.070]  I really recommend
[02:39:31.070 --> 02:39:33.070]  use that armory because it's again an organic
[02:39:33.070 --> 02:39:35.070]  product but if you
[02:39:35.070 --> 02:39:37.070]  have it in your indoor room you need to
[02:39:37.070 --> 02:39:39.070]  clean that indoor room good you need to take every
[02:39:39.070 --> 02:39:41.070]  plant out of there clean that entire
[02:39:41.070 --> 02:39:43.070]  room very very sterilely I like to
[02:39:43.070 --> 02:39:45.070]  use hydrogen peroxide bleach and
[02:39:45.290 --> 02:39:47.290]  rubbing alcohol mixed touch
[02:39:47.290 --> 02:39:49.290]  every corner touch all your hoods touch everything
[02:39:49.290 --> 02:39:51.290]  if you have a sulfur burner
[02:39:51.290 --> 02:39:53.290]  that's when you use it without any
[02:39:53.290 --> 02:39:55.290]  plants in the room without anything it'll just
[02:39:55.290 --> 02:39:57.290]  cover everything sulfur people that use
[02:39:57.290 --> 02:39:59.290]  sulfur for powdery mildew it just hides
[02:39:59.290 --> 02:40:01.290]  it so whenever you spray it
[02:40:01.290 --> 02:40:03.290]  it has to touch everything on that plant
[02:40:03.290 --> 02:40:05.290]  but again that's why I like to use it for russets
[02:40:05.290 --> 02:40:07.290]  because russets you just have to make sure you
[02:40:07.290 --> 02:40:09.290]  touch the entire plant they die
[02:40:09.290 --> 02:40:11.290]  if you use it right before flower if you have
[02:40:11.290 --> 02:40:13.290]  them or if they're just starting out that'll
[02:40:13.510 --> 02:40:15.510]  last until like week six seven and flower
[02:40:15.510 --> 02:40:17.510]  so you're gonna be like oh fuck they're starting to like
[02:40:17.510 --> 02:40:19.510]  they're starting to come on so you can take some of your
[02:40:19.510 --> 02:40:21.510]  smalls off but still have all your meat
[02:40:21.510 --> 02:40:23.510]  you're not allowed to use sulfur burners
[02:40:23.510 --> 02:40:25.510]  in California now they just did they just
[02:40:25.510 --> 02:40:27.510]  um they just made it illegal
[02:40:27.510 --> 02:40:29.510]  because it's not it's not certified
[02:40:29.510 --> 02:40:31.510]  for
[02:40:31.510 --> 02:40:33.510]  I want to say a human presence they
[02:40:33.510 --> 02:40:35.510]  haven't done the testing to prove what it
[02:40:35.510 --> 02:40:37.510]  can do to you and so they just disallowed it so
[02:40:37.510 --> 02:40:39.510]  you're not allowed to you're no longer allowed to use
[02:40:39.510 --> 02:40:41.510]  any sulfur burners good a lot
[02:40:41.730 --> 02:40:43.730]  of people are using those in their veg and flower
[02:40:43.730 --> 02:40:45.730]  rooms you ever get we've got
[02:40:45.730 --> 02:40:47.730]  rotten eggs well you can use sulfur as
[02:40:47.730 --> 02:40:49.730]  a spray because
[02:40:49.730 --> 02:40:51.730]  dustable wettable but not as a vapor
[02:40:51.730 --> 02:40:53.730]  vaporized sulfur is no longer allowed
[02:40:53.730 --> 02:40:55.730]  insecticidal strips that people put in their
[02:40:55.730 --> 02:40:57.730]  rooms they off they off gas
[02:40:57.730 --> 02:40:59.730]  pesticides oh yeah yeah those are dead
[02:40:59.730 --> 02:41:01.730]  yeah that's not that's not that won't pass
[02:41:01.730 --> 02:41:03.730]  COA either but this is just
[02:41:03.730 --> 02:41:05.730]  I want to say Cal Cannabis or CDFA
[02:41:05.730 --> 02:41:07.730]  one of the ag groups that regulate us
[02:41:07.730 --> 02:41:09.730]  just sent me a bulletin in the mail
[02:41:09.950 --> 02:41:11.950]  email saying hey we've disallowed
[02:41:11.950 --> 02:41:13.950]  sulfur burners I'm glad they did away with neem
[02:41:13.950 --> 02:41:15.950]  too because well neem's good for veg but again
[02:41:15.950 --> 02:41:17.950]  like that's not going to test in your flower so I
[02:41:17.950 --> 02:41:19.950]  mean you can still use it on your veg
[02:41:19.950 --> 02:41:21.950]  but dude people were being dumb
[02:41:21.950 --> 02:41:23.950]  and being like week six oh I see Mike so spray
[02:41:23.950 --> 02:41:25.950]  some neem oil like what are you doing
[02:41:25.950 --> 02:41:27.950]  dude making all your weed taste like
[02:41:27.950 --> 02:41:29.950]  peanuts yeah I was curious
[02:41:29.950 --> 02:41:31.950]  um similar to the
[02:41:31.950 --> 02:41:33.950]  conversation we had the other day about
[02:41:33.950 --> 02:41:35.950]  secondary metabolites and stress implants
[02:41:35.950 --> 02:41:37.950]  um have you seen any
[02:41:38.170 --> 02:41:40.170]  correlation between the
[02:41:40.170 --> 02:41:42.170]  obese plants and a lack of
[02:41:42.170 --> 02:41:44.170]  calcium and silica
[02:41:44.170 --> 02:41:46.170]  when they get really high in sugars do you see a
[02:41:46.170 --> 02:41:48.170]  drop in calcium and silica
[02:41:48.170 --> 02:41:50.170]  I think I think typically
[02:41:50.170 --> 02:41:52.170]  when you're overloading the plants
[02:41:52.170 --> 02:41:54.170]  in general
[02:41:54.170 --> 02:41:56.170]  your some people are laying
[02:41:56.170 --> 02:41:58.170]  enough calcium and some people are laying enough
[02:41:58.170 --> 02:42:00.170]  silicon but I just think that what's
[02:42:00.170 --> 02:42:02.170]  really taking place is that you're putting
[02:42:02.170 --> 02:42:04.170]  too much sap
[02:42:04.170 --> 02:42:06.170]  into the plant period
[02:42:06.390 --> 02:42:08.390]  and so we need calcium for cell wall
[02:42:08.390 --> 02:42:10.390]  we need silicate to help drive
[02:42:10.390 --> 02:42:12.390]  uh trigidity and we need it for
[02:42:12.390 --> 02:42:14.390]  epidural strength
[02:42:14.390 --> 02:42:16.390]  um but when we
[02:42:16.390 --> 02:42:18.390]  magnesium that's actually one of your natural sweeteners
[02:42:18.390 --> 02:42:20.390]  right there well yeah sulfur
[02:42:20.390 --> 02:42:22.390]  too sulfur's gonna drive sulfur's a
[02:42:22.390 --> 02:42:24.390]  a terp transporter
[02:42:24.390 --> 02:42:26.390]  magnesium is 12% sulfur
[02:42:26.390 --> 02:42:28.390]  and 13% manganese
[02:42:30.390 --> 02:42:32.390]  I mean epsom salt is but
[02:42:32.390 --> 02:42:34.390]  magnesium has no sulfur in it by itself
[02:42:34.610 --> 02:42:36.610]  epsom salt
[02:42:36.610 --> 02:42:38.610]  magnesium is magnesium
[02:42:38.610 --> 02:42:40.610]  sulfur is sulfur
[02:42:40.610 --> 02:42:42.610]  but epsom salt is both
[02:42:42.610 --> 02:42:44.610]  epsom salt is that is sulfur and
[02:42:44.610 --> 02:42:46.610]  magnesium in a combined mix
[02:42:46.610 --> 02:42:48.610]  I guess yeah cause that's
[02:42:48.610 --> 02:42:50.610]  that's what it is
[02:42:50.610 --> 02:42:52.610]  one of the sources I use
[02:42:52.610 --> 02:42:54.610]  but it's yeah so mag by itself
[02:42:54.610 --> 02:42:56.610]  is mag
[02:42:56.610 --> 02:42:58.610]  and you need that for
[02:42:58.610 --> 02:43:00.610]  chlorophyll assimilation
[02:43:00.610 --> 02:43:02.610]  you can't utilize nitrogen correctly
[02:43:02.830 --> 02:43:04.830]  without magnesium but
[02:43:04.830 --> 02:43:06.830]  so typically when you're seeing low mag
[02:43:06.830 --> 02:43:08.830]  you're seeing plants that aren't photosynthesizing
[02:43:08.830 --> 02:43:10.830]  correctly
[02:43:10.830 --> 02:43:12.830]  but for me you know agro calcium to keep my cell walls turgid
[02:43:12.830 --> 02:43:14.830]  and build cell
[02:43:14.830 --> 02:43:16.830]  and
[02:43:16.830 --> 02:43:18.830]  silica in some form
[02:43:18.830 --> 02:43:20.830]  to be able to get a better epidural
[02:43:20.830 --> 02:43:22.830]  layer on the plant but I just think that
[02:43:22.830 --> 02:43:24.830]  there's a balance where you're
[02:43:24.830 --> 02:43:26.830]  laying too much
[02:43:26.830 --> 02:43:28.830]  nitrogen into the plant and you're making
[02:43:28.830 --> 02:43:30.830]  it too sappy so there has
[02:43:31.050 --> 02:43:33.050]  to be a balance and I think that what we do is we overload
[02:43:33.050 --> 02:43:35.050]  it and it's
[02:43:35.050 --> 02:43:37.050]  when you're trying to do it through
[02:43:37.050 --> 02:43:39.050]  a
[02:43:39.050 --> 02:43:41.050]  non biologically driven
[02:43:41.050 --> 02:43:43.050]  uptake because if my biology
[02:43:43.050 --> 02:43:45.050]  is correct the plant's only going to take
[02:43:45.050 --> 02:43:47.050]  up what it wants but when I'm
[02:43:47.050 --> 02:43:49.050]  bypassing the biology and I'm going into the
[02:43:49.050 --> 02:43:51.050]  root directly is where we start
[02:43:51.050 --> 02:43:53.050]  to manufacture the issue
[02:43:53.050 --> 02:43:55.050]  and so just from seeing so
[02:43:55.050 --> 02:43:57.050]  many crops I say man biologically
[02:43:57.050 --> 02:43:59.050]  driven crops I see so less
[02:43:59.270 --> 02:44:01.270]  problems on
[02:44:01.270 --> 02:44:03.270]  I mean fuck almost like night and
[02:44:03.270 --> 02:44:05.270]  day and that's what made me really start
[02:44:05.270 --> 02:44:07.270]  to realize it was that the more we want the
[02:44:07.270 --> 02:44:09.270]  plant to be big if it's not meant to be
[02:44:09.270 --> 02:44:11.270]  big like Joel Eitel remember we were talking about
[02:44:11.270 --> 02:44:13.270]  Joel's doing the breeding where he's
[02:44:13.270 --> 02:44:15.270]  going for these massive 23 pound plants
[02:44:15.270 --> 02:44:17.270]  that's because he's genetically
[02:44:17.270 --> 02:44:19.270]  searching for the outliers that throw
[02:44:19.270 --> 02:44:21.270]  mega sized plants
[02:44:21.270 --> 02:44:23.270]  and so he's not having a lot of the
[02:44:23.270 --> 02:44:25.270]  issues people have because he's
[02:44:25.270 --> 02:44:27.270]  running really clean delivery systems
[02:44:27.490 --> 02:44:29.490]  but he's using the genomic ability
[02:44:29.490 --> 02:44:31.490]  to get the size
[02:44:31.490 --> 02:44:33.490]  it's kind of like me like I'm 5'7
[02:44:33.490 --> 02:44:35.490]  and I should be about like 165 right
[02:44:35.490 --> 02:44:37.490]  if I put on weight
[02:44:37.490 --> 02:44:39.490]  and I'm 190 I look thick
[02:44:39.490 --> 02:44:41.490]  but I'm definitely not the same health
[02:44:41.490 --> 02:44:43.490]  as I am at 165
[02:44:43.490 --> 02:44:45.490]  I'm just carrying excess weight
[02:44:45.490 --> 02:44:47.490]  my system isn't meant to handle it my heart
[02:44:47.490 --> 02:44:49.490]  my lungs my liver aren't meant to be
[02:44:49.490 --> 02:44:51.490]  on a 35
[02:44:51.490 --> 02:44:53.490]  pound greater draw than
[02:44:53.490 --> 02:44:55.490]  what I'm naturally meant to be body weight
[02:44:55.710 --> 02:44:57.710]  wise from athletic perspective
[02:44:57.710 --> 02:44:59.710]  you know?
[02:44:59.710 --> 02:45:01.710]  So for you and Steve
[02:45:01.710 --> 02:45:03.710]  like
[02:45:03.710 --> 02:45:05.710]  kind of living soil
[02:45:05.710 --> 02:45:07.710]  versus
[02:45:07.710 --> 02:45:09.710]  like hydro
[02:45:09.710 --> 02:45:11.710]  plant
[02:45:11.710 --> 02:45:13.710]  is one plant
[02:45:13.710 --> 02:45:15.710]  like the
[02:45:15.710 --> 02:45:17.710]  like
[02:45:17.710 --> 02:45:19.710]  springy long distance runner
[02:45:19.710 --> 02:45:21.710]  another is like the Lebron James
[02:45:21.710 --> 02:45:23.710]  that's just like super big
[02:45:23.930 --> 02:45:25.930]  and can leap tall buildings
[02:45:25.930 --> 02:45:27.930]  and another is like
[02:45:27.930 --> 02:45:29.930]  the dude lying on the couch eating
[02:45:29.930 --> 02:45:31.930]  Twinkies
[02:45:31.930 --> 02:45:33.930]  for different
[02:45:33.930 --> 02:45:35.930]  grow methodologies
[02:45:35.930 --> 02:45:37.930]  how would you equate them
[02:45:37.930 --> 02:45:39.930]  to humans?
[02:45:39.930 --> 02:45:41.930]  Well
[02:45:41.930 --> 02:45:43.930]  for chemically driven plants if we can maintain
[02:45:43.930 --> 02:45:45.930]  sterility in the room and buffer it
[02:45:45.930 --> 02:45:47.930]  it's
[02:45:47.930 --> 02:45:49.930]  to me it's almost like steroidal
[02:45:49.930 --> 02:45:51.930]  where you can get
[02:45:52.150 --> 02:45:54.150]  a level of production that is super natural
[02:45:54.150 --> 02:45:56.150]  So you have like Eastern European
[02:45:56.150 --> 02:45:58.150]  Olympian
[02:45:58.150 --> 02:46:00.150]  or like
[02:46:00.150 --> 02:46:02.150]  German Olympian in the 70s
[02:46:02.150 --> 02:46:04.150]  Yeah the growth rate is unreal
[02:46:04.150 --> 02:46:06.150]  I mean if you're really running a dialed
[02:46:06.150 --> 02:46:08.150]  you're running a dialed hydro system
[02:46:08.150 --> 02:46:10.150]  where you're getting
[02:46:10.150 --> 02:46:12.150]  you're squirting a cube 8 times a day
[02:46:12.150 --> 02:46:14.150]  your VPD is
[02:46:14.150 --> 02:46:16.150]  perfect so you're never having the stomata
[02:46:16.150 --> 02:46:18.150]  shut off so you're getting maximum
[02:46:18.150 --> 02:46:20.150]  transpiration the entire time
[02:46:20.370 --> 02:46:22.370]  your PPFD is on point
[02:46:22.370 --> 02:46:24.370]  and your genetic selection is on point
[02:46:24.370 --> 02:46:26.370]  they're pulling numbers off of the footprint
[02:46:26.370 --> 02:46:28.370]  that are mind bending right now
[02:46:28.370 --> 02:46:30.370]  I mean the fucking weight per square foot
[02:46:30.370 --> 02:46:32.370]  coming out of some of these ops is insane
[02:46:32.370 --> 02:46:34.370]  and because they spent so much money
[02:46:34.370 --> 02:46:36.370]  on control and when you go into the rooms
[02:46:36.370 --> 02:46:38.370]  you're getting blown off and you're in a fucking lab
[02:46:38.370 --> 02:46:40.370]  gown you can do it
[02:46:40.370 --> 02:46:42.370]  but when you take that
[02:46:42.370 --> 02:46:44.370]  technology and take it outside
[02:46:44.370 --> 02:46:46.370]  where you don't have the controls
[02:46:46.370 --> 02:46:48.370]  and you're relying on the plant to handle it
[02:46:48.590 --> 02:46:50.590]  it doesn't work as well
[02:46:50.590 --> 02:46:52.590]  and so for me if you're running
[02:46:52.590 --> 02:46:54.590]  indoor operations you can run
[02:46:54.590 --> 02:46:56.590]  no-till and stuff like that but you have
[02:46:56.590 --> 02:46:58.590]  to have really good branding
[02:46:58.590 --> 02:47:00.590]  excellent marketing because you gotta get
[02:47:00.590 --> 02:47:02.590]  people to pay you more money for that
[02:47:02.590 --> 02:47:04.590]  product because you're not gonna
[02:47:04.590 --> 02:47:06.590]  get as much per square foot
[02:47:06.590 --> 02:47:08.590]  you're just not and so I think like
[02:47:08.590 --> 02:47:10.590]  a good example of an indoor guy running
[02:47:10.590 --> 02:47:12.590]  biologically driven systems
[02:47:12.590 --> 02:47:14.590]  is Steve Cantwell from Green Life
[02:47:14.590 --> 02:47:16.590]  up in Vegas right
[02:47:16.810 --> 02:47:18.810]  so he's pulling over to a bulb
[02:47:18.810 --> 02:47:20.810]  on a thing which in commercial hydro
[02:47:20.810 --> 02:47:22.810]  is half of what you're looking for
[02:47:22.810 --> 02:47:24.810]  because a lot of these ops now are touching four
[02:47:24.810 --> 02:47:26.810]  frequently four per thousand
[02:47:26.810 --> 02:47:28.810]  watts of input of light
[02:47:28.810 --> 02:47:30.810]  the customer isn't
[02:47:30.810 --> 02:47:32.810]  as discerning
[02:47:32.810 --> 02:47:34.810]  as you wish they were and so if they can drop
[02:47:34.810 --> 02:47:36.810]  the price on that higher yield
[02:47:36.810 --> 02:47:38.810]  number they can get you
[02:47:38.810 --> 02:47:40.810]  but for me my focus is
[02:47:40.810 --> 02:47:42.810]  primarily outdoor cultivation
[02:47:42.810 --> 02:47:44.810]  and I just
[02:47:45.030 --> 02:47:47.030]  notice that biologically driven
[02:47:47.030 --> 02:47:49.030]  plants they start off slower
[02:47:49.030 --> 02:47:51.030]  they look slower through the midlife
[02:47:51.030 --> 02:47:53.030]  but once they kick into flower
[02:47:53.030 --> 02:47:55.030]  they really shine and you end up
[02:47:55.030 --> 02:47:57.030]  getting more product in the bag
[02:47:57.030 --> 02:47:59.030]  Can I pop in Kev?
[02:47:59.030 --> 02:48:01.030]  Oh yeah what's up big Josh?
[02:48:01.030 --> 02:48:03.030]  What's up man how you doing?
[02:48:03.030 --> 02:48:05.030]  Good brother good to see you yeah yeah go big man
[02:48:05.030 --> 02:48:07.030]  because you're as versed in this as anybody
[02:48:07.030 --> 02:48:09.030]  I know. What's up big
[02:48:09.030 --> 02:48:11.030]  perm?
[02:48:11.250 --> 02:48:13.250]  So
[02:48:13.250 --> 02:48:15.250]  the whole conversation ties
[02:48:15.250 --> 02:48:17.250]  in really well
[02:48:17.250 --> 02:48:19.250]  what I've learned through trial
[02:48:19.250 --> 02:48:21.250]  and error is that too much
[02:48:21.250 --> 02:48:23.250]  nitrogen in the system
[02:48:23.250 --> 02:48:25.250]  ends up producing a lower bud
[02:48:25.250 --> 02:48:27.250]  size in a living soil
[02:48:27.250 --> 02:48:29.250]  so when I dump on
[02:48:29.250 --> 02:48:31.250]  it is true that the plant drives the
[02:48:31.250 --> 02:48:33.250]  system but it's also true
[02:48:33.250 --> 02:48:35.250]  that we make the system that they
[02:48:35.250 --> 02:48:37.250]  get to operate within
[02:48:37.250 --> 02:48:39.250]  so like all
[02:48:39.470 --> 02:48:41.470]  guys that like to push it to the limit
[02:48:41.470 --> 02:48:43.470]  I've dumped as much shit here and there
[02:48:43.470 --> 02:48:45.470]  as I can on these beds
[02:48:45.470 --> 02:48:47.470]  and I've seen
[02:48:47.470 --> 02:48:49.470]  really high production of terpenes
[02:48:49.470 --> 02:48:51.470]  really high production of
[02:48:51.470 --> 02:48:53.470]  cannabinoids and crystals
[02:48:53.470 --> 02:48:55.470]  but lower
[02:48:55.470 --> 02:48:57.470]  bud production lower size
[02:48:57.470 --> 02:48:59.470]  when you have too much nitrogen in there
[02:48:59.470 --> 02:49:01.470]  and
[02:49:01.470 --> 02:49:03.470]  who was talking about it
[02:49:03.470 --> 02:49:05.470]  a couple shows back
[02:49:05.470 --> 02:49:07.470]  about the difference
[02:49:07.690 --> 02:49:09.690]  sorry
[02:49:09.690 --> 02:49:11.690]  the difference between nitrogen in form
[02:49:11.690 --> 02:49:13.690]  of mineral and nitrogen
[02:49:13.690 --> 02:49:15.690]  in form of like poop
[02:49:15.690 --> 02:49:17.690]  you know or from animal
[02:49:17.690 --> 02:49:19.690]  actually
[02:49:19.690 --> 02:49:21.690]  who gets into this pretty deep is
[02:49:21.690 --> 02:49:23.690]  Scott Granola
[02:49:23.690 --> 02:49:25.690]  he's looking at his microscope
[02:49:25.690 --> 02:49:27.690]  he's talked about this stuff but when you're looking at
[02:49:27.690 --> 02:49:29.690]  a living soil that has too much stuff
[02:49:29.690 --> 02:49:31.690]  that is undigested
[02:49:31.690 --> 02:49:33.690]  then you end up getting these pathogens
[02:49:33.690 --> 02:49:35.690]  that are coming in
[02:49:35.910 --> 02:49:37.910]  and you have to get these decomposers
[02:49:37.910 --> 02:49:39.910]  to do all the work
[02:49:39.910 --> 02:49:41.910]  and the heavy lifting
[02:49:41.910 --> 02:49:43.910]  to make this stuff mineralized
[02:49:43.910 --> 02:49:45.910]  and so in this whole process
[02:49:45.910 --> 02:49:47.910]  I think that a lot of us
[02:49:47.910 --> 02:49:49.910]  have built our beds
[02:49:49.910 --> 02:49:51.910]  myself being the number one dude
[02:49:51.910 --> 02:49:53.910]  up with so much nitrogen
[02:49:53.910 --> 02:49:55.910]  and so much nutrients
[02:49:55.910 --> 02:49:57.910]  that the plants are just like
[02:49:57.910 --> 02:49:59.910]  it slows them down
[02:49:59.910 --> 02:50:01.910]  and honestly I've been
[02:50:01.910 --> 02:50:03.910]  three to four years
[02:50:04.130 --> 02:50:06.130]  and I saw it get better
[02:50:06.130 --> 02:50:08.130]  and better and better
[02:50:08.130 --> 02:50:10.130]  I'm harvesting right now
[02:50:10.130 --> 02:50:12.130]  I got about two thirds
[02:50:12.130 --> 02:50:14.130]  of the greenhouse down
[02:50:14.130 --> 02:50:16.130]  and based upon
[02:50:16.130 --> 02:50:18.130]  this swirling of information
[02:50:18.130 --> 02:50:20.130]  I'm changing the way I'm going to apply nutrients
[02:50:20.130 --> 02:50:22.130]  this round
[02:50:22.130 --> 02:50:24.130]  and this will be the first time in probably three to four years
[02:50:24.130 --> 02:50:26.130]  that I put something down
[02:50:26.130 --> 02:50:28.130]  but I'm putting a bunch of rock dust
[02:50:28.130 --> 02:50:30.130]  tying back into talking with
[02:50:30.130 --> 02:50:32.130]  what's his name
[02:50:32.350 --> 02:50:34.350]  I'm blanking
[02:50:34.350 --> 02:50:36.350]  it's been a long day
[02:50:36.350 --> 02:50:38.350]  the soil ninja
[02:50:38.350 --> 02:50:40.350]  oh yeah Delano
[02:50:40.350 --> 02:50:42.350]  so getting a lot of clay in there
[02:50:42.350 --> 02:50:44.350]  a lot of rock dust
[02:50:44.350 --> 02:50:46.350]  I got three or four different kinds
[02:50:46.350 --> 02:50:48.350]  and then I'm going to
[02:50:48.350 --> 02:50:50.350]  throw a bunch of malted barley down
[02:50:50.350 --> 02:50:52.350]  which is something I haven't done in a while
[02:50:52.350 --> 02:50:54.350]  that's what you were saying
[02:50:54.350 --> 02:50:56.350]  you like the malted barley over the dextro
[02:50:56.350 --> 02:50:58.350]  they have a ready to use form
[02:50:58.350 --> 02:51:00.350]  but you didn't get the hyphae growth you noticed
[02:51:00.570 --> 02:51:02.570]  nitrogen maintains
[02:51:02.570 --> 02:51:04.570]  the juvenility
[02:51:04.570 --> 02:51:06.570]  and that it doesn't allow the plant
[02:51:06.570 --> 02:51:08.570]  just like too much nitrogen slows down
[02:51:08.570 --> 02:51:10.570]  the flowering process
[02:51:10.570 --> 02:51:12.570]  so if your plant is over vegetated
[02:51:12.570 --> 02:51:14.570]  you end up having a later flowering cycle
[02:51:14.570 --> 02:51:16.570]  and I wonder if that has to do
[02:51:16.570 --> 02:51:18.570]  also with flower size
[02:51:18.570 --> 02:51:20.570]  because you get a bigger frame
[02:51:20.570 --> 02:51:22.570]  on the plant but you don't get the same
[02:51:22.570 --> 02:51:24.570]  flower cluster because it's not
[02:51:24.570 --> 02:51:26.570]  shifting into reproductive gear
[02:51:26.570 --> 02:51:28.570]  and a lot of it is learning
[02:51:28.790 --> 02:51:30.790]  and timing is the kind of way I think
[02:51:30.790 --> 02:51:32.790]  about it too you have a lot more control
[02:51:32.790 --> 02:51:34.790]  with the hydro system
[02:51:34.790 --> 02:51:36.790]  but with a living soil system
[02:51:36.790 --> 02:51:38.790]  it's like a semi almost
[02:51:38.790 --> 02:51:40.790]  you get it going and you're like
[02:51:40.790 --> 02:51:42.790]  oh fuck it's moving
[02:51:42.790 --> 02:51:44.790]  and so
[02:51:44.790 --> 02:51:46.790]  I've kind of learned that I have to prematurely
[02:51:46.790 --> 02:51:48.790]  flip
[02:51:48.790 --> 02:51:50.790]  once I see them just kind of moving
[02:51:50.790 --> 02:51:52.790]  flip because they're going to catch up
[02:51:52.790 --> 02:51:54.790]  and move real fast
[02:51:54.790 --> 02:51:56.790]  this last stretch I just had the folks
[02:51:57.010 --> 02:51:59.010]  at Harvest for me they're synthetic
[02:51:59.010 --> 02:52:01.010]  growers and they came and helped and it was really awesome
[02:52:01.010 --> 02:52:03.010]  and they have a ton of experience
[02:52:03.010 --> 02:52:05.010]  they're like the first licensed growers in Washington
[02:52:05.010 --> 02:52:07.010]  and she was like
[02:52:07.010 --> 02:52:09.010]  why didn't you chop
[02:52:09.010 --> 02:52:11.010]  this and bring it up and everything
[02:52:11.010 --> 02:52:13.010]  I was like it grew 48 inches
[02:52:13.010 --> 02:52:15.010]  in the flip like legitimately
[02:52:15.010 --> 02:52:17.010]  I'm trying to keep up here but that's what happened
[02:52:17.010 --> 02:52:19.010]  it just fucking took off
[02:52:19.010 --> 02:52:21.010]  you know
[02:52:21.010 --> 02:52:23.010]  so like
[02:52:23.010 --> 02:52:25.010]  when you're using like Grokashi
[02:52:25.230 --> 02:52:27.230]  that's an accelerant
[02:52:27.230 --> 02:52:29.230]  you have to back that out of the system
[02:52:29.230 --> 02:52:31.230]  early too
[02:52:31.230 --> 02:52:33.230]  any of the lactoacid bacillus because it seems like
[02:52:33.230 --> 02:52:35.230]  it keeps driving the process
[02:52:35.230 --> 02:52:37.230]  and it doesn't allow you to finish
[02:52:37.230 --> 02:52:39.230]  the flower
[02:52:39.230 --> 02:52:41.230]  you almost want to go
[02:52:41.230 --> 02:52:43.230]  wait hold on Josh
[02:52:43.230 --> 02:52:45.230]  wait just quickly because Kevin
[02:52:45.230 --> 02:52:47.230]  you just segued into
[02:52:47.230 --> 02:52:49.230]  a long
[02:52:49.230 --> 02:52:51.230]  long time ago Ken Freeman
[02:52:51.230 --> 02:52:53.230]  said can Kevin talk about how Grokashi
[02:52:53.450 --> 02:52:55.450]  pushes out plant pathogens
[02:52:57.450 --> 02:52:59.450]  what it is is
[02:52:59.450 --> 02:53:01.450]  that I think that
[02:53:01.450 --> 02:53:03.450]  the concept was from Alan Atkinson
[02:53:03.450 --> 02:53:05.450]  where he talked about competitive exclusion
[02:53:05.450 --> 02:53:07.450]  and you hear that from Scotty Grinnell
[02:53:07.450 --> 02:53:09.450]  a lot too right
[02:53:09.450 --> 02:53:11.450]  where the good and the bad
[02:53:11.450 --> 02:53:13.450]  fight it out and there's something
[02:53:13.450 --> 02:53:15.450]  about lactoacid that
[02:53:15.450 --> 02:53:17.450]  allows the plant to help
[02:53:17.450 --> 02:53:19.450]  fight and what it did for us
[02:53:19.450 --> 02:53:21.450]  in terms of viral contamination
[02:53:21.670 --> 02:53:23.670]  was it allowed us to take plants that were
[02:53:23.670 --> 02:53:25.670]  virally contaminated and get them down
[02:53:25.670 --> 02:53:27.670]  to a level where we weren't seeing
[02:53:27.670 --> 02:53:29.670]  any longer
[02:53:29.670 --> 02:53:31.670]  a decrease in production of
[02:53:31.670 --> 02:53:33.670]  weight, cannabinoids or
[02:53:33.670 --> 02:53:35.670]  terpenes so we had a test
[02:53:35.670 --> 02:53:37.670]  a standard
[02:53:37.670 --> 02:53:39.670]  that we knew we could compare to
[02:53:39.670 --> 02:53:41.670]  and then the virologists were bringing me plants
[02:53:41.670 --> 02:53:43.670]  that were contaminated
[02:53:43.670 --> 02:53:45.670]  that we could then run and then I was
[02:53:45.670 --> 02:53:47.670]  taking them and putting them into these anaerobic systems
[02:53:47.670 --> 02:53:49.670]  to see if we could follow
[02:53:49.890 --> 02:53:51.890]  Alan's theory of competitive exclusion
[02:53:51.890 --> 02:53:53.890]  would it work and it allowed us
[02:53:53.890 --> 02:53:55.890]  to scrub the plant out
[02:53:55.890 --> 02:53:57.890]  so when you tested it, it still was
[02:53:57.890 --> 02:53:59.890]  present in its cellular test
[02:53:59.890 --> 02:54:01.890]  but it didn't
[02:54:01.890 --> 02:54:03.890]  impact
[02:54:03.890 --> 02:54:05.890]  the main components that we
[02:54:05.890 --> 02:54:07.890]  were seeking but what happened was
[02:54:07.890 --> 02:54:09.890]  if you took that plant and you stressed it
[02:54:09.890 --> 02:54:11.890]  if you took it out of a good nutritional program
[02:54:11.890 --> 02:54:13.890]  if you put it through something that made it
[02:54:13.890 --> 02:54:15.890]  have a bump
[02:54:15.890 --> 02:54:17.890]  you would see the virus increase
[02:54:18.110 --> 02:54:20.110]  in intensity and then rehab
[02:54:20.110 --> 02:54:22.110]  the effect so the only way to
[02:54:22.110 --> 02:54:24.110]  really clean it was through
[02:54:24.110 --> 02:54:26.110]  meristem scrubbing but at
[02:54:26.110 --> 02:54:28.110]  that time a meristem scrub was like 10
[02:54:28.110 --> 02:54:30.110]  grand and I was trying to come
[02:54:30.110 --> 02:54:32.110]  up with a method that would
[02:54:32.110 --> 02:54:34.110]  allow people who were regular people
[02:54:34.110 --> 02:54:36.110]  the ability to keep stock without
[02:54:36.110 --> 02:54:38.110]  having these viroid
[02:54:38.110 --> 02:54:40.110]  issues because it was wiping out
[02:54:40.110 --> 02:54:42.110]  the form, they weren't able to keep
[02:54:42.110 --> 02:54:44.110]  the plant and I knew that as
[02:54:44.110 --> 02:54:46.110]  time went by meristem scrubbing
[02:54:46.330 --> 02:54:48.330]  would become more affordable but for the
[02:54:48.330 --> 02:54:50.330]  average person, 10 grand a scrub
[02:54:50.330 --> 02:54:52.330]  is just not
[02:54:52.330 --> 02:54:54.330]  and so this was a whole bunch of
[02:54:54.330 --> 02:54:56.330]  virologists that came to me and said hey we have
[02:54:56.330 --> 02:54:58.330]  this thing and we want to know
[02:54:58.330 --> 02:55:00.330]  if you want to play with us on this project
[02:55:00.330 --> 02:55:02.330]  and I said yeah I'm down, I'll play with you guys
[02:55:02.330 --> 02:55:04.330]  and so it allowed us to take a
[02:55:04.330 --> 02:55:06.330]  look at this and then a couple years later
[02:55:06.330 --> 02:55:08.330]  Dark Heart said you know they
[02:55:08.330 --> 02:55:10.330]  and it's nothing against Dark Heart, I don't think it's against them personally
[02:55:10.330 --> 02:55:12.330]  but they said you know we identified this
[02:55:12.330 --> 02:55:14.330]  pathogen, as far as I'm concerned, it's Ritchrom
[02:55:14.550 --> 02:55:16.550]  so Ritchrom's a PhD virologist
[02:55:16.550 --> 02:55:18.550]  and Ritchrom was the guy that really brought it
[02:55:18.550 --> 02:55:20.550]  and said look we've discovered something, he showed
[02:55:20.550 --> 02:55:22.550]  me the slides, he showed me the
[02:55:22.550 --> 02:55:24.550]  it was like a calcium crystal
[02:55:24.550 --> 02:55:26.550]  within the vascular bundles and it slowed
[02:55:26.550 --> 02:55:28.550]  the flow of
[02:55:28.550 --> 02:55:30.550]  nutrients through the xylem and the phloem
[02:55:30.550 --> 02:55:32.550]  and it didn't allow the plant to
[02:55:32.550 --> 02:55:34.550]  stack tissue, didn't allow it
[02:55:34.550 --> 02:55:36.550]  to form secondary metabolites
[02:55:36.550 --> 02:55:38.550]  which then decreased
[02:55:38.550 --> 02:55:40.550]  both weight and cannabinoids
[02:55:40.550 --> 02:55:42.550]  and terpenes so the
[02:55:42.770 --> 02:55:44.770]  destruction was the issue
[02:55:44.770 --> 02:55:46.770]  and so when I was able to utilize
[02:55:46.770 --> 02:55:48.770]  Alan's theory of competitive
[02:55:48.770 --> 02:55:50.770]  exclusion using Grokashi in an earth
[02:55:50.770 --> 02:55:52.770]  box, Crum would be able to
[02:55:52.770 --> 02:55:54.770]  take that tissue, slice
[02:55:54.770 --> 02:55:56.770]  it, scope it, and then
[02:55:56.770 --> 02:55:58.770]  once we said hey we're seeing such a reduction
[02:55:58.770 --> 02:56:00.770]  I could then run it in a test
[02:56:00.770 --> 02:56:02.770]  produce the flower
[02:56:02.770 --> 02:56:04.770]  and then they could then lab it
[02:56:04.770 --> 02:56:06.770]  and compare it to clean material
[02:56:06.770 --> 02:56:08.770]  so it let us know that we were
[02:56:08.770 --> 02:56:10.770]  right within range but all you had
[02:56:10.990 --> 02:56:12.990]  to do was screw up and you were right back to where you started
[02:56:12.990 --> 02:56:14.990]  but the bottom
[02:56:14.990 --> 02:56:16.990]  line was that natural biology
[02:56:16.990 --> 02:56:18.990]  the plant wants to survive
[02:56:18.990 --> 02:56:20.990]  just like you do, if your
[02:56:20.990 --> 02:56:22.990]  nutrition is good and your basic
[02:56:22.990 --> 02:56:24.990]  situation is good you can fight off most
[02:56:24.990 --> 02:56:26.990]  things but if I take you and put you
[02:56:26.990 --> 02:56:28.990]  into a stressful situation and pull you out
[02:56:28.990 --> 02:56:30.990]  of homostasis, pull you out of natural balance
[02:56:30.990 --> 02:56:32.990]  you're vulnerable
[02:56:32.990 --> 02:56:34.990]  it's why like if you want to get a good cold
[02:56:34.990 --> 02:56:36.990]  go have a couple drinks and go to a
[02:56:36.990 --> 02:56:38.990]  public event, drink in the house no issue
[02:56:39.210 --> 02:56:41.210]  drink a couple beers at a club and let someone
[02:56:41.210 --> 02:56:43.210]  come through that has a nasty cold
[02:56:43.210 --> 02:56:45.210]  the chances of you picking that up increase
[02:56:45.210 --> 02:56:47.210]  dramatically and I think that's the same
[02:56:47.210 --> 02:56:49.210]  way with plants and like Josh
[02:56:49.210 --> 02:56:51.210]  is saying it's once the system
[02:56:51.210 --> 02:56:53.210]  turns on it's running like a train
[02:56:53.210 --> 02:56:55.210]  so for him he figured
[02:56:55.210 --> 02:56:57.210]  after week three I add no more
[02:56:57.210 --> 02:56:59.210]  accelerants and so he's dialing
[02:56:59.210 --> 02:57:01.210]  it in but so many of us are
[02:57:01.210 --> 02:57:03.210]  trying to understand this that you need guys
[02:57:03.210 --> 02:57:05.210]  like Josh that are constantly
[02:57:05.210 --> 02:57:07.210]  experimenting, I experiment with other shit
[02:57:07.430 --> 02:57:09.430]  and I share that info, Josh is
[02:57:09.430 --> 02:57:11.430]  experimenting with what he's doing with his living
[02:57:11.430 --> 02:57:13.430]  soil and how he's pushing it
[02:57:13.430 --> 02:57:15.430]  and he's got such a diverse
[02:57:15.430 --> 02:57:17.430]  background in other cultivation
[02:57:17.430 --> 02:57:19.430]  forms that it lets him see some really interesting
[02:57:19.430 --> 02:57:21.430]  shit, that's why I like hanging out with Josh
[02:57:21.430 --> 02:57:23.430]  Josh, back to you
[02:57:23.430 --> 02:57:25.430]  Josh
[02:57:25.430 --> 02:57:27.430]  back to you Josh
[02:57:27.430 --> 02:57:29.430]  I was just going to interject one question, how long
[02:57:29.430 --> 02:57:31.430]  of a process, how long did you have to grow that in that
[02:57:31.430 --> 02:57:33.430]  earth box before it came up clean?
[02:57:33.430 --> 02:57:35.430]  It took about 45
[02:57:35.650 --> 02:57:37.650]  days to get new material
[02:57:37.650 --> 02:57:39.650]  I would take these virally infected plants
[02:57:39.650 --> 02:57:41.650]  I'd put them in an earth box
[02:57:41.650 --> 02:57:43.650]  and I would just use a good compost
[02:57:43.650 --> 02:57:45.650]  and then run
[02:57:45.650 --> 02:57:47.650]  the Grokashi which is Alan's mix
[02:57:47.650 --> 02:57:49.650]  because it has a few other little things
[02:57:49.650 --> 02:57:51.650]  in it and then I would add
[02:57:51.650 --> 02:57:53.650]  a shot glass of
[02:57:53.650 --> 02:57:55.650]  EM1 once a week, I'd drop
[02:57:55.650 --> 02:57:57.650]  it in the resi down below
[02:57:57.650 --> 02:57:59.650]  so this way we knew we had it constantly circulating
[02:57:59.650 --> 02:58:01.650]  and the plant would literally
[02:58:01.650 --> 02:58:03.650]  sit still for a month, I mean
[02:58:03.870 --> 02:58:05.870]  it would look frozen
[02:58:05.870 --> 02:58:07.870]  and then all of a sudden you'd start to see
[02:58:07.870 --> 02:58:09.870]  the exterior layer crack
[02:58:09.870 --> 02:58:11.870]  and you'd see these new green
[02:58:11.870 --> 02:58:13.870]  lines of new cambium material
[02:58:13.870 --> 02:58:15.870]  running up the sides of the plant
[02:58:15.870 --> 02:58:17.870]  and you'd see new growth appear
[02:58:17.870 --> 02:58:19.870]  at the tips and it would start
[02:58:19.870 --> 02:58:21.870]  to shed all its old leaves
[02:58:21.870 --> 02:58:23.870]  and the plant
[02:58:23.870 --> 02:58:25.870]  you could break every branch off
[02:58:25.870 --> 02:58:27.870]  once this thing changed, you now
[02:58:27.870 --> 02:58:29.870]  had plasticity again
[02:58:29.870 --> 02:58:31.870]  but it took a full month
[02:58:32.090 --> 02:58:34.090]  of just sitting
[02:58:34.090 --> 02:58:36.090]  and then all of a sudden you started to see the changes
[02:58:36.090 --> 02:58:38.090]  so in about 45 days I would get a plant
[02:58:38.090 --> 02:58:40.090]  that I could get viable tips from
[02:58:40.090 --> 02:58:42.090]  and I would cut the tips
[02:58:42.090 --> 02:58:44.090]  clone that
[02:58:44.090 --> 02:58:46.090]  and we found out that it made
[02:58:46.090 --> 02:58:48.090]  a mistake that it would revert because
[02:58:48.090 --> 02:58:50.090]  when I did the first test on it
[02:58:50.090 --> 02:58:52.090]  when I had the plants
[02:58:52.090 --> 02:58:54.090]  in veg
[02:58:54.090 --> 02:58:56.090]  one tray of plants was getting too much
[02:58:56.090 --> 02:58:58.090]  light from another side light
[02:58:58.090 --> 02:59:00.090]  and it made the plant
[02:59:00.310 --> 02:59:02.310]  metabolize too quickly
[02:59:02.310 --> 02:59:04.310]  and those plants re-exhibited
[02:59:04.310 --> 02:59:06.310]  the viral traits and I sent them to
[02:59:06.310 --> 02:59:08.310]  Rick and he scanned them and said
[02:59:08.310 --> 02:59:10.310]  alright these are recontaminated
[02:59:10.310 --> 02:59:12.310]  but the tray that was in board
[02:59:12.310 --> 02:59:14.310]  on that table that did not
[02:59:14.310 --> 02:59:16.310]  get over metabolized did not
[02:59:16.310 --> 02:59:18.310]  display it
[02:59:18.310 --> 02:59:20.310]  and from those plants we were able to run
[02:59:20.310 --> 02:59:22.310]  the clonal numbers
[02:59:22.310 --> 02:59:24.310]  come back, I mean when we were doing the testing on it
[02:59:24.310 --> 02:59:26.310]  one of these plants
[02:59:26.310 --> 02:59:28.310]  was only throwing like 3 clones out of
[02:59:28.530 --> 02:59:30.530]  300 cups and I got it back
[02:59:30.530 --> 02:59:32.530]  up to 300 out of 300
[02:59:32.530 --> 02:59:34.530]  and so and that's not
[02:59:34.530 --> 02:59:36.530]  because I was doing anything so wonderful
[02:59:36.530 --> 02:59:38.530]  with my cloning process it was just the fact
[02:59:38.530 --> 02:59:40.530]  that the plant was able to stay in a state
[02:59:40.530 --> 02:59:42.530]  of juvenility and because it
[02:59:42.530 --> 02:59:44.530]  didn't have obstructed vascular bundles
[02:59:44.530 --> 02:59:46.530]  it could create
[02:59:46.530 --> 02:59:48.530]  the chemistry needed within the plant
[02:59:48.530 --> 02:59:50.530]  to maintain health
[02:59:50.530 --> 02:59:52.530]  when you
[02:59:52.530 --> 02:59:54.530]  I was gonna ask
[02:59:54.530 --> 02:59:56.530]  when you were coming off
[02:59:56.750 --> 02:59:58.750]  that first plant that's sick and you're getting your
[02:59:58.750 --> 03:00:00.750]  new growth
[03:00:00.750 --> 03:00:02.750]  question one is how far did you
[03:00:02.750 --> 03:00:04.750]  ever in the history of doing
[03:00:04.750 --> 03:00:06.750]  this experiment did you let that go out
[03:00:06.750 --> 03:00:08.750]  and then two what was
[03:00:08.750 --> 03:00:10.750]  it like when you cut those
[03:00:10.750 --> 03:00:12.750]  were you fighting hollow stems
[03:00:12.750 --> 03:00:14.750]  no
[03:00:14.750 --> 03:00:16.750]  no I wasn't because once I got into
[03:00:16.750 --> 03:00:18.750]  new material I was good and I know that
[03:00:18.750 --> 03:00:20.750]  we had a good mix so usually we equate
[03:00:20.750 --> 03:00:22.750]  hollow stem with boron deficiency
[03:00:22.750 --> 03:00:24.750]  yeah it is mom
[03:00:24.970 --> 03:00:26.970]  what's up Kaya
[03:00:26.970 --> 03:00:28.970]  how's it
[03:00:28.970 --> 03:00:30.970]  we weren't having that and I did let some of those plants get bigger
[03:00:30.970 --> 03:00:32.970]  but the bottom line is once I
[03:00:32.970 --> 03:00:34.970]  snipped the fresh material
[03:00:34.970 --> 03:00:36.970]  I wanted that to be
[03:00:36.970 --> 03:00:38.970]  in the mom because I wanted to be
[03:00:38.970 --> 03:00:40.970]  able to get my
[03:00:40.970 --> 03:00:42.970]  branching quicker it's just like if you're
[03:00:42.970 --> 03:00:44.970]  messing with marist stem stock right
[03:00:44.970 --> 03:00:46.970]  you're getting a nodal
[03:00:46.970 --> 03:00:48.970]  distance that's incredibly
[03:00:48.970 --> 03:00:50.970]  reduced which lets you have a lot
[03:00:50.970 --> 03:00:52.970]  more branching quicker which lets
[03:00:53.190 --> 03:00:55.190]  you prune better which lets you shape the
[03:00:55.190 --> 03:00:57.190]  plant better and so
[03:00:57.190 --> 03:00:59.190]  I wanted that ability and so I
[03:00:59.190 --> 03:01:01.190]  allowed some of these to get larger
[03:01:01.190 --> 03:01:03.190]  but I didn't want the old material
[03:01:03.190 --> 03:01:05.190]  I wanted the new material that was
[03:01:05.190 --> 03:01:07.190]  coming out that was really herbaceous
[03:01:07.190 --> 03:01:09.190]  and you can tell the viral contamination
[03:01:09.190 --> 03:01:11.190]  on that latent viroid
[03:01:11.190 --> 03:01:13.190]  because if you just touch it it snaps
[03:01:13.190 --> 03:01:15.190]  there's no plasticity
[03:01:15.190 --> 03:01:17.190]  whatsoever and
[03:01:17.190 --> 03:01:19.190]  clonal rates suck
[03:01:19.190 --> 03:01:21.190]  and cannabinoid terpene
[03:01:21.410 --> 03:01:23.410]  and so I let
[03:01:23.410 --> 03:01:25.410]  the plants get bigger
[03:01:25.410 --> 03:01:27.410]  and the plant levels
[03:01:27.410 --> 03:01:29.410]  diminished, yield diminished
[03:01:29.410 --> 03:01:31.410]  and once we cleaned it up
[03:01:31.410 --> 03:01:33.410]  we saw a radical change
[03:01:33.410 --> 03:01:35.410]  and I coined it
[03:01:35.410 --> 03:01:37.410]  ghetto microprop because it was
[03:01:37.410 --> 03:01:39.410]  for people that weren't rich
[03:01:39.410 --> 03:01:41.410]  and for me I'm from the hood
[03:01:41.410 --> 03:01:43.410]  and so I always like stuff
[03:01:43.410 --> 03:01:45.410]  that works really cheaply
[03:01:45.410 --> 03:01:47.410]  because that's where most people in the world
[03:01:47.410 --> 03:01:49.410]  live most people don't have full sun
[03:01:49.630 --> 03:01:51.630]  plants that need less food
[03:01:51.630 --> 03:01:53.630]  plants that need less tending
[03:01:53.630 --> 03:01:55.630]  plants that are more resistant
[03:01:55.630 --> 03:01:57.630]  and methods to help that are cheaper
[03:01:57.630 --> 03:01:59.630]  and simpler I really like
[03:01:59.630 --> 03:02:01.630]  even though I'm tied into incredibly
[03:02:01.630 --> 03:02:03.630]  technical operations my
[03:02:03.630 --> 03:02:05.630]  background is New England
[03:02:05.630 --> 03:02:07.630]  fisherman you know what I mean
[03:02:07.630 --> 03:02:09.630]  like I'm fucking coastal
[03:02:09.630 --> 03:02:11.630]  so I see things from that background
[03:02:11.630 --> 03:02:13.630]  almost always and that's why
[03:02:13.630 --> 03:02:15.630]  I liked it so much and that's why
[03:02:15.630 --> 03:02:17.630]  I talk about it so often is that
[03:02:17.850 --> 03:02:19.850]  it was an incredible tool because
[03:02:19.850 --> 03:02:21.850]  I had a virology team
[03:02:21.850 --> 03:02:23.850]  that was doing the testing
[03:02:23.850 --> 03:02:25.850]  so I knew that it wasn't just antidotal
[03:02:25.850 --> 03:02:27.850]  I knew that it wasn't just my opinion
[03:02:27.850 --> 03:02:29.850]  I had quantified results that we
[03:02:29.850 --> 03:02:31.850]  no longer saw the bundles
[03:02:31.850 --> 03:02:33.850]  but we could pick up the pathogen
[03:02:33.850 --> 03:02:35.850]  in a petri dish because it would migrate
[03:02:35.850 --> 03:02:37.850]  out of the tissue into the petri dish
[03:02:37.850 --> 03:02:39.850]  so they could test
[03:02:39.850 --> 03:02:41.850]  for it but all these
[03:02:41.850 --> 03:02:43.850]  other factors were reduced
[03:02:43.850 --> 03:02:45.850]  it's just that if you made a mistake
[03:02:46.070 --> 03:02:48.070]  and stress the plant
[03:02:48.070 --> 03:02:50.070]  the virus would reappear
[03:02:50.070 --> 03:02:52.070]  and you'd go right back
[03:02:52.070 --> 03:02:54.070]  to step one and that's where Meristem
[03:02:54.070 --> 03:02:56.070]  is it scrubbed and until I
[03:02:56.070 --> 03:02:58.070]  recontaminate the plant we're good
[03:02:58.070 --> 03:03:00.070]  that's where like with Sergio from Cultivated
[03:03:00.070 --> 03:03:02.070]  he's getting pure stock material
[03:03:02.070 --> 03:03:04.070]  but if you look at his
[03:03:04.070 --> 03:03:06.070]  operation it's clean
[03:03:06.070 --> 03:03:08.070]  and the operators are clean
[03:03:08.070 --> 03:03:10.070]  the people are clean so what he's doing is
[03:03:10.070 --> 03:03:12.070]  he's not doing true micro prop
[03:03:12.070 --> 03:03:14.070]  he's doing conventional propagation
[03:03:14.290 --> 03:03:16.290]  but he's making sure that he's not having
[03:03:16.290 --> 03:03:18.290]  the vector transmission
[03:03:18.290 --> 03:03:20.290]  of the issue be him
[03:03:20.290 --> 03:03:22.290]  so it's ok
[03:03:22.290 --> 03:03:24.290]  true normal
[03:03:24.290 --> 03:03:26.290]  propagation is fine
[03:03:26.290 --> 03:03:28.290]  it's just that you have to be really
[03:03:28.290 --> 03:03:30.290]  conscientious about not being a vector
[03:03:30.290 --> 03:03:32.290]  and most aren't
[03:03:32.290 --> 03:03:34.290]  in his case he is
[03:03:34.290 --> 03:03:36.290]  so it allows him to not have to go
[03:03:36.290 --> 03:03:38.290]  directly from TC where
[03:03:38.290 --> 03:03:40.290]  from the lab to the end user
[03:03:40.290 --> 03:03:42.290]  he goes from
[03:03:42.510 --> 03:03:44.510]  lab to him to the end user
[03:03:44.510 --> 03:03:46.510]  but his conventional prop is beautiful
[03:03:46.510 --> 03:03:48.510]  and I know because I have some of the
[03:03:48.510 --> 03:03:50.510]  plants that I put into
[03:03:50.510 --> 03:03:52.510]  the system that went through his process
[03:03:52.510 --> 03:03:54.510]  and I have them back
[03:03:54.510 --> 03:03:56.510]  and they fucking kill her
[03:03:58.510 --> 03:04:00.510]  you make a mistake man
[03:04:00.510 --> 03:04:02.510]  you have a problem so it's a great tool to use
[03:04:02.510 --> 03:04:04.510]  and I didn't invent it
[03:04:04.510 --> 03:04:06.510]  it's nothing to do with me
[03:04:06.510 --> 03:04:08.510]  Alan Atkinson
[03:04:08.510 --> 03:04:10.510]  was always this huge proponent
[03:04:10.730 --> 03:04:12.730]  of competitive exclusion
[03:04:12.730 --> 03:04:14.730]  and aerobics and so when Elaine came in
[03:04:14.730 --> 03:04:16.730]  we talked about it and she was like
[03:04:16.730 --> 03:04:18.730]  she didn't agree with it but I showed her
[03:04:18.730 --> 03:04:20.730]  the plants and I said look here's all the data
[03:04:20.730 --> 03:04:22.730]  here's the information and she said well fuck it's working
[03:04:22.730 --> 03:04:24.730]  maybe it's the definition of what
[03:04:24.730 --> 03:04:26.730]  is aerobic and what is non-aerobic
[03:04:26.730 --> 03:04:28.730]  because it came down to ppm of oxygen
[03:04:28.730 --> 03:04:30.730]  and so so much
[03:04:30.730 --> 03:04:32.730]  of what we talk about
[03:04:32.730 --> 03:04:34.730]  is grey area and each side
[03:04:34.730 --> 03:04:36.730]  battles out who's right
[03:04:36.730 --> 03:04:38.730]  but the fact is if the plant's doing well
[03:04:38.950 --> 03:04:40.950]  and it's surviving and it's producing
[03:04:40.950 --> 03:04:42.950]  it can't be wrong
[03:04:44.950 --> 03:04:46.950]  I've been preaching
[03:04:46.950 --> 03:04:48.950]  competitive exclusion since aquaponics
[03:04:48.950 --> 03:04:50.950]  since I started with that
[03:04:50.950 --> 03:04:52.950]  I've always talked about the competitive exclusion
[03:04:52.950 --> 03:04:54.950]  factor it makes a huge difference
[03:04:54.950 --> 03:04:56.950]  Steve Reisner talked about it
[03:04:56.950 --> 03:04:58.950]  you're actually the first person
[03:04:58.950 --> 03:05:00.950]  I ever heard who used
[03:05:00.950 --> 03:05:02.950]  aquaponics
[03:05:02.950 --> 03:05:04.950]  and there was an article
[03:05:04.950 --> 03:05:06.950]  where somebody smoked some of your aquaponic herb
[03:05:07.170 --> 03:05:09.170]  and they said it was some of the cleanest burning shit they ever smoked
[03:05:09.170 --> 03:05:11.170]  and they used the phrase
[03:05:11.170 --> 03:05:13.170]  competitive exclusion
[03:05:13.170 --> 03:05:15.170]  in that article too
[03:05:15.170 --> 03:05:17.170]  I didn't invent it either
[03:05:17.170 --> 03:05:19.170]  it's an ancient
[03:05:19.170 --> 03:05:21.170]  it's well known
[03:05:21.170 --> 03:05:23.170]  principle
[03:05:23.170 --> 03:05:25.170]  and Steve Reisner
[03:05:25.170 --> 03:05:27.170]  from Potent Ponics
[03:05:27.170 --> 03:05:29.170]  Steve's
[03:05:29.170 --> 03:05:31.170]  an aquaponics freak
[03:05:31.170 --> 03:05:33.170]  but he talks about the incredible amount
[03:05:33.170 --> 03:05:35.170]  of biology that's going on
[03:05:35.390 --> 03:05:37.390]  inside that system
[03:05:37.390 --> 03:05:39.390]  it's hard to dial it in for production
[03:05:39.390 --> 03:05:41.390]  weight but in terms of health
[03:05:41.390 --> 03:05:43.390]  and vitality for vegetative
[03:05:43.390 --> 03:05:45.390]  he was killing it
[03:05:45.390 --> 03:05:47.390]  everybody's different
[03:05:47.390 --> 03:05:49.390]  everybody's system sets up different
[03:05:49.390 --> 03:05:51.390]  I didn't sacrifice yield to grow aquaponics
[03:05:51.390 --> 03:05:53.390]  but I did it
[03:05:53.390 --> 03:05:55.390]  I had a hybrid system I built
[03:05:55.390 --> 03:05:57.390]  I call it bioponics
[03:05:57.390 --> 03:05:59.390]  if you pictured
[03:05:59.390 --> 03:06:01.390]  a 6 inch soil pot
[03:06:01.390 --> 03:06:03.390]  or a 6 inch mesh pot
[03:06:03.610 --> 03:06:05.610]  I've done it with mesh and rocks
[03:06:05.610 --> 03:06:07.610]  and also
[03:06:07.610 --> 03:06:09.610]  with a regular
[03:06:09.610 --> 03:06:11.610]  6 inch pot
[03:06:11.610 --> 03:06:13.610]  but both of them I use 2 long
[03:06:13.610 --> 03:06:15.610]  nylon wicks that don't float
[03:06:15.610 --> 03:06:17.610]  the ones that suck up water
[03:06:17.610 --> 03:06:19.610]  so you'll have
[03:06:19.610 --> 03:06:21.610]  4 tails
[03:06:21.610 --> 03:06:23.610]  hanging down from these 2 ropes
[03:06:23.610 --> 03:06:25.610]  on every pot
[03:06:25.610 --> 03:06:27.610]  and I give them, depending on which end of my
[03:06:27.610 --> 03:06:29.610]  aquaponics table they're in
[03:06:29.610 --> 03:06:31.610]  they have 2 to 3 feet of roots
[03:06:31.830 --> 03:06:33.830]  and at the bottom of the table there would always be
[03:06:33.830 --> 03:06:35.830]  an inch or 2 of water as well
[03:06:35.830 --> 03:06:37.830]  with a raised drain
[03:06:37.830 --> 03:06:39.830]  so there was always that
[03:06:39.830 --> 03:06:41.830]  so if the drip pump stopped
[03:06:41.830 --> 03:06:43.830]  or the mister pump because it was aeroponic
[03:06:43.830 --> 03:06:45.830]  you had passive irrigation
[03:06:45.830 --> 03:06:47.830]  you had 4 carrots
[03:06:47.830 --> 03:06:49.830]  growing down each rope
[03:06:49.830 --> 03:06:51.830]  with fur coming off them
[03:06:51.830 --> 03:06:53.830]  like you'd have as much
[03:06:53.830 --> 03:06:55.830]  remember I was telling you
[03:06:55.830 --> 03:06:57.830]  the 6 by 6 spacing
[03:06:57.830 --> 03:06:59.830]  of the switchgun cuttings
[03:07:00.050 --> 03:07:02.050]  those bats
[03:07:02.050 --> 03:07:04.050]  even like in the mid 90's
[03:07:04.050 --> 03:07:06.050]  I could show 4 pounds of light
[03:07:06.050 --> 03:07:08.050]  and people would say you staged that picture
[03:07:08.050 --> 03:07:10.050]  like people wouldn't believe it
[03:07:10.050 --> 03:07:12.050]  because it was
[03:07:12.050 --> 03:07:14.050]  just bats but you'd have the same amount
[03:07:14.050 --> 03:07:16.050]  of root you'd have under like a 5 gallon
[03:07:16.050 --> 03:07:18.050]  or 7 gallon plant
[03:07:18.050 --> 03:07:20.050]  under that one bud
[03:07:20.050 --> 03:07:22.050]  and you'd just have bats
[03:07:22.050 --> 03:07:24.050]  and having those
[03:07:24.050 --> 03:07:26.050]  but I could do it with soil in the pots
[03:07:26.050 --> 03:07:28.050]  or I'd do the rocks
[03:07:28.270 --> 03:07:30.270]  and when they needed the boost
[03:07:30.270 --> 03:07:32.270]  I had a boost mix that I gave them
[03:07:32.270 --> 03:07:34.270]  that would either be
[03:07:34.270 --> 03:07:36.270]  if they were in green magrone
[03:07:36.270 --> 03:07:38.270]  they'd get a spoon full of castings
[03:07:38.270 --> 03:07:40.270]  and then I made more flowering
[03:07:40.270 --> 03:07:42.270]  powder organic
[03:07:42.270 --> 03:07:44.270]  blend I made, Steve's special blend
[03:07:44.270 --> 03:07:46.270]  back in the days which had
[03:07:46.270 --> 03:07:48.270]  17 different things, I won't list the whole thing
[03:07:48.270 --> 03:07:50.270]  right now but
[03:07:50.270 --> 03:07:52.270]  it was more of a
[03:07:52.270 --> 03:07:54.270]  flower boost so I mean
[03:07:54.270 --> 03:07:56.270]  I got fat yields growing
[03:07:56.490 --> 03:07:58.490]  aquaponically so I never understood
[03:07:58.490 --> 03:08:00.490]  when people said well you can only grow lettuce
[03:08:00.490 --> 03:08:02.490]  and not tomatoes I'm like
[03:08:02.490 --> 03:08:04.490]  I had tomatoes in my
[03:08:04.490 --> 03:08:06.490]  grow store because I had an aquaponic grow store
[03:08:06.490 --> 03:08:08.490]  at the time and
[03:08:08.490 --> 03:08:10.490]  I had tomatoes just
[03:08:10.490 --> 03:08:12.490]  peeling off the branches
[03:08:12.490 --> 03:08:14.490]  they're peeling the bark down the plant
[03:08:14.490 --> 03:08:16.490]  because they're so fat
[03:08:16.490 --> 03:08:18.490]  I never understood
[03:08:18.490 --> 03:08:20.490]  when people said oh they're only good for lettuce
[03:08:20.490 --> 03:08:22.490]  it's like you've never done it then
[03:08:22.490 --> 03:08:24.490]  or you've never done it right at least
[03:08:24.710 --> 03:08:26.710]  I don't think enough people get enough
[03:08:26.710 --> 03:08:28.710]  mineralization Steve, this is Joshua
[03:08:28.710 --> 03:08:30.710]  you know what I mean, you gotta get
[03:08:30.710 --> 03:08:32.710]  yeah, you're in a setup
[03:08:32.710 --> 03:08:34.710]  I put that dry mix into a
[03:08:34.710 --> 03:08:36.710]  nylon sock when they were
[03:08:36.710 --> 03:08:38.710]  flowering and I put that
[03:08:38.710 --> 03:08:40.710]  nylon sock of mostly
[03:08:40.710 --> 03:08:42.710]  you know phosphorus potassium
[03:08:42.710 --> 03:08:44.710]  source stuff whether it's rock phosphate
[03:08:44.710 --> 03:08:46.710]  or langbanite all kinds
[03:08:46.710 --> 03:08:48.710]  of cool rocks
[03:08:48.710 --> 03:08:50.710]  mainly and
[03:08:50.710 --> 03:08:52.710]  guanos but you put that in a
[03:08:52.930 --> 03:08:54.930]  nylon sock in the reservoir
[03:08:54.930 --> 03:08:56.930]  the aquarium or the sweet water system
[03:08:56.930 --> 03:08:58.930]  with light
[03:08:58.930 --> 03:09:00.930]  on it especially
[03:09:00.930 --> 03:09:02.930]  that thing grows mold
[03:09:02.930 --> 03:09:04.930]  or algaes like you
[03:09:04.930 --> 03:09:06.930]  couldn't believe and the algae
[03:09:06.930 --> 03:09:08.930]  eaters are attached to
[03:09:08.930 --> 03:09:10.930]  like pigs at a trough
[03:09:10.930 --> 03:09:12.930]  and they're just huffing a cloud
[03:09:12.930 --> 03:09:14.930]  out of it and they're just
[03:09:14.930 --> 03:09:16.930]  all lined up on both sides of it
[03:09:16.930 --> 03:09:18.930]  the algae eaters and you just think
[03:09:18.930 --> 03:09:20.930]  you know if you weren't giving them
[03:09:21.150 --> 03:09:23.150]  an extra flower boost that way
[03:09:23.150 --> 03:09:25.150]  you might sacrifice
[03:09:25.150 --> 03:09:27.150]  some size but if you were on your
[03:09:27.150 --> 03:09:29.150]  game and upped them when
[03:09:29.150 --> 03:09:31.150]  they needed it you could pull off
[03:09:31.150 --> 03:09:33.150]  the weight you know
[03:09:33.150 --> 03:09:35.150]  you'd sacrifice nothing
[03:09:35.150 --> 03:09:37.150]  before I forget because
[03:09:37.150 --> 03:09:39.150]  well I earlier I just kept trying
[03:09:39.150 --> 03:09:41.150]  to remember cause I was a little out there
[03:09:41.150 --> 03:09:43.150]  but the
[03:09:43.150 --> 03:09:45.150]  my number one solution if you
[03:09:45.150 --> 03:09:47.150]  got aphids is
[03:09:47.150 --> 03:09:49.150]  grow red kale
[03:09:49.370 --> 03:09:51.370]  obviously once you figure out you've got
[03:09:51.370 --> 03:09:53.370]  aphids it might be too late to start your
[03:09:53.370 --> 03:09:55.370]  kale seeds but if you plant
[03:09:55.370 --> 03:09:57.370]  kale with your weed
[03:09:57.370 --> 03:09:59.370]  in the spring and kale
[03:09:59.370 --> 03:10:01.370]  you can plant in the fall even
[03:10:01.370 --> 03:10:03.370]  you can have all
[03:10:03.370 --> 03:10:05.370]  the aphids in the garden
[03:10:05.370 --> 03:10:07.370]  on sweet red kale
[03:10:07.370 --> 03:10:09.370]  I've grown four types of kale around
[03:10:09.370 --> 03:10:11.370]  pot and all kinds of other things
[03:10:11.370 --> 03:10:13.370]  and the number one banker
[03:10:13.370 --> 03:10:15.370]  plant I found for aphids is
[03:10:15.370 --> 03:10:17.370]  all of the aphids I will have
[03:10:17.590 --> 03:10:19.590]  aphids on top of aphids on
[03:10:19.590 --> 03:10:21.590]  every square inch of the
[03:10:21.590 --> 03:10:23.590]  fucking red kale
[03:10:23.590 --> 03:10:25.590]  and that plant can be
[03:10:25.590 --> 03:10:27.590]  touching a pot plant
[03:10:27.590 --> 03:10:29.590]  and still there's no aphids
[03:10:29.590 --> 03:10:31.590]  on the pot plant cause they prefer the
[03:10:31.590 --> 03:10:33.590]  red kale so much more
[03:10:33.590 --> 03:10:35.590]  like they love it
[03:10:35.590 --> 03:10:37.590]  so interestingly
[03:10:37.590 --> 03:10:39.590]  it must be specific
[03:10:39.590 --> 03:10:41.590]  than with that red kale because I have
[03:10:41.590 --> 03:10:43.590]  kale and I am struggling with a little bit
[03:10:43.590 --> 03:10:45.590]  of aphids and I don't have red
[03:10:45.810 --> 03:10:47.810]  kale so it must be
[03:10:47.810 --> 03:10:49.810]  specifically to the red kale then
[03:10:49.810 --> 03:10:51.810]  it's sweeter
[03:10:51.810 --> 03:10:53.810]  cause I tried it with the black russian kale
[03:10:53.810 --> 03:10:55.810]  I did four types at once
[03:10:55.810 --> 03:10:57.810]  and they were all over the red kale
[03:10:57.810 --> 03:10:59.810]  so the red kale was the
[03:10:59.810 --> 03:11:01.810]  sweetest type and you try that
[03:11:01.810 --> 03:11:03.810]  and mark my words they prefer it
[03:11:03.810 --> 03:11:05.810]  a thousand times more than any
[03:11:05.810 --> 03:11:07.810]  cannabis and that has
[03:11:07.810 --> 03:11:09.810]  saved all the aphids
[03:11:09.810 --> 03:11:11.810]  off the plants you know
[03:11:11.810 --> 03:11:13.810]  and the other thing for mildew
[03:11:14.030 --> 03:11:16.030]  I wanted to bring up quick
[03:11:16.030 --> 03:11:18.030]  for indoor people suffering mildew
[03:11:18.030 --> 03:11:20.030]  A, you know of course genetics
[03:11:20.030 --> 03:11:22.030]  is important but
[03:11:22.030 --> 03:11:24.030]  the easiest fix of
[03:11:24.030 --> 03:11:26.030]  indoor and expensive in
[03:11:26.030 --> 03:11:28.030]  greenhouse but still works
[03:11:28.030 --> 03:11:30.030]  is you gotta hit
[03:11:30.030 --> 03:11:32.030]  34-35 Celsius
[03:11:32.030 --> 03:11:34.030]  every day
[03:11:34.030 --> 03:11:36.030]  until it's gone at the
[03:11:36.030 --> 03:11:38.030]  coolest part of your garden
[03:11:38.030 --> 03:11:40.030]  wherever your garden is
[03:11:40.030 --> 03:11:42.030]  the shadiest coolest spot
[03:11:42.250 --> 03:11:44.250]  and make sure the temperature
[03:11:44.250 --> 03:11:46.250]  hits say 35 Celsius
[03:11:46.250 --> 03:11:48.250]  for 10 minutes every day
[03:11:48.250 --> 03:11:50.250]  and eventually you won't see it
[03:11:50.250 --> 03:11:52.250]  just quickly for the Americans
[03:11:52.250 --> 03:11:54.250]  watching
[03:11:54.250 --> 03:11:56.250]  what's that in Fahrenheit?
[03:11:56.250 --> 03:11:58.250]  100?
[03:11:58.250 --> 03:12:00.250]  95
[03:12:00.250 --> 03:12:02.250]  95
[03:12:02.250 --> 03:12:04.250]  so if you can hold that
[03:12:04.250 --> 03:12:06.250]  for 5 or 10 minutes
[03:12:06.250 --> 03:12:08.250]  you know in the middle of your cycle or whenever
[03:12:08.250 --> 03:12:10.250]  just have it get up
[03:12:10.470 --> 03:12:12.470]  to that and you won't have
[03:12:12.470 --> 03:12:14.470]  mildew. Mildew doesn't survive
[03:12:14.470 --> 03:12:16.470]  at those temperatures
[03:12:16.470 --> 03:12:18.470]  it's like 38-3.8
[03:12:18.470 --> 03:12:20.470]  or something is the top
[03:12:20.470 --> 03:12:22.470]  tolerance for heat
[03:12:22.470 --> 03:12:24.470]  for species of mildew. Mildew
[03:12:24.470 --> 03:12:26.470]  recreates really fast
[03:12:26.470 --> 03:12:28.470]  and the spores won't all be dead
[03:12:28.470 --> 03:12:30.470]  you do that every day for a week
[03:12:30.470 --> 03:12:32.470]  two weeks
[03:12:32.470 --> 03:12:34.470]  you'll see it gone and then you can just
[03:12:34.470 --> 03:12:36.470]  do it every week or so
[03:12:36.470 --> 03:12:38.470]  and then really keep
[03:12:38.690 --> 03:12:40.690]  it at that. Keep doing it at least once a month
[03:12:40.690 --> 03:12:42.690]  or whatever you
[03:12:42.690 --> 03:12:44.690]  I think you should run a garden like that
[03:12:44.690 --> 03:12:46.690]  man. Not every day hitting those temps
[03:12:46.690 --> 03:12:48.690]  but at least weekly
[03:12:48.690 --> 03:12:50.690]  my plants love it
[03:12:50.690 --> 03:12:52.690]  they need to get hot to get rid of
[03:12:52.690 --> 03:12:54.690]  mildew or you don't get rid of it
[03:12:54.690 --> 03:12:56.690]  and between crops the very best way
[03:12:56.690 --> 03:12:58.690]  to clean up a root
[03:12:58.690 --> 03:13:00.690]  is pasteurization
[03:13:00.690 --> 03:13:02.690]  so I think pasteurization
[03:13:02.690 --> 03:13:04.690]  is a matter of how hot you get for how
[03:13:04.690 --> 03:13:06.690]  long and the rule
[03:13:06.910 --> 03:13:08.910]  of thumb I have is
[03:13:08.910 --> 03:13:10.910]  60 degrees celsius for 24
[03:13:10.910 --> 03:13:12.910]  hours and you've pasteurized
[03:13:12.910 --> 03:13:14.910]  that root
[03:13:14.910 --> 03:13:16.910]  there's no chemical
[03:13:16.910 --> 03:13:18.910]  residue, you're not buying chemicals
[03:13:18.910 --> 03:13:20.910]  from anybody
[03:13:20.910 --> 03:13:22.910]  you're not
[03:13:22.910 --> 03:13:24.910]  all you're doing is cooking everything
[03:13:24.910 --> 03:13:26.910]  it's just the most basic way
[03:13:26.910 --> 03:13:28.910]  to clean a place
[03:13:28.910 --> 03:13:30.910]  just quickly
[03:13:30.910 --> 03:13:32.910]  for the celsius
[03:13:32.910 --> 03:13:34.910]  challenge that's 140 degrees
[03:13:35.130 --> 03:13:37.130]  they're doing that
[03:13:37.130 --> 03:13:39.130]  for termite control
[03:13:39.130 --> 03:13:41.130]  they seal the whole house
[03:13:41.130 --> 03:13:43.130]  and then they heat the whole house up to that temperature
[03:13:43.130 --> 03:13:45.130]  and they create
[03:13:45.130 --> 03:13:47.130]  this way they don't have to infuse
[03:13:47.130 --> 03:13:49.130]  any kind of pesticides into the home
[03:13:49.130 --> 03:13:51.130]  yeah that's right
[03:13:51.130 --> 03:13:53.130]  they seal the whole house and then heat the shit out of it
[03:13:53.130 --> 03:13:55.130]  that's right
[03:13:55.130 --> 03:13:57.130]  you sanitize the total place
[03:13:57.130 --> 03:13:59.130]  even sterilize
[03:13:59.130 --> 03:14:01.130]  I think that the
[03:14:01.130 --> 03:14:03.130]  same temperature you recommend to go to
[03:14:03.350 --> 03:14:05.350]  for 10 minutes a day is the same
[03:14:05.350 --> 03:14:07.350]  temperature that plants tend to shut down at
[03:14:07.350 --> 03:14:09.350]  it hits their upper limit
[03:14:09.350 --> 03:14:11.350]  it hits their upper limit
[03:14:11.350 --> 03:14:13.350]  you know
[03:14:13.350 --> 03:14:15.350]  but that's where everything is shutting down
[03:14:15.350 --> 03:14:17.350]  and some stuff turning right off
[03:14:17.350 --> 03:14:19.350]  not just shutting down but expiring
[03:14:19.350 --> 03:14:21.350]  but honestly
[03:14:21.350 --> 03:14:23.350]  I've done these heat treatments
[03:14:23.350 --> 03:14:25.350]  that Josh and Kelly from Dragonfly
[03:14:25.350 --> 03:14:27.350]  recommend this heat treatment
[03:14:27.350 --> 03:14:29.350]  and they taught this trick
[03:14:29.350 --> 03:14:31.350]  to me I don't know about 2 years ago
[03:14:31.570 --> 03:14:33.570]  but 120 degrees
[03:14:33.570 --> 03:14:35.570]  for 2 hours
[03:14:35.570 --> 03:14:37.570]  and that's leaf surface temp
[03:14:37.570 --> 03:14:39.570]  and as long as the plants
[03:14:39.570 --> 03:14:41.570]  have plenty of water
[03:14:41.570 --> 03:14:43.570]  and they have plenty of nutrients
[03:14:43.570 --> 03:14:45.570]  they love it dude
[03:14:45.570 --> 03:14:47.570]  their arms go straight up
[03:14:47.570 --> 03:14:49.570]  like
[03:14:49.570 --> 03:14:51.570]  I mean you're burning off tons of your flower
[03:14:51.570 --> 03:14:53.570]  but they love it
[03:14:53.570 --> 03:14:55.570]  yeah I grow in Columbia
[03:14:55.570 --> 03:14:57.570]  and often I'm harvesting
[03:14:57.570 --> 03:14:59.570]  stuff that's around 40 Celsius
[03:14:59.790 --> 03:15:01.790]  somebody's going to look that up
[03:15:01.790 --> 03:15:03.790]  it's online so it's not me
[03:15:03.790 --> 03:15:05.790]  40 Celsius is pretty
[03:15:05.790 --> 03:15:07.790]  common hot
[03:15:07.790 --> 03:15:09.790]  temperature for us and I know
[03:15:09.790 --> 03:15:11.790]  some people
[03:15:11.790 --> 03:15:13.790]  don't think pot likes to be that hot
[03:15:13.790 --> 03:15:15.790]  but if it's
[03:15:15.790 --> 03:15:17.790]  most pot will take it you know it really will
[03:15:17.790 --> 03:15:19.790]  sometimes when they're flowering when it's that hot
[03:15:19.790 --> 03:15:21.790]  they start to put up
[03:15:21.790 --> 03:15:23.790]  a little more leaf towards the top
[03:15:23.790 --> 03:15:25.790]  of the bud I think
[03:15:25.790 --> 03:15:27.790]  to shade the tips
[03:15:28.010 --> 03:15:30.010]  they'll put up a bit
[03:15:30.010 --> 03:15:32.010]  but it's like when they're too close to the lights
[03:15:32.010 --> 03:15:34.010]  you would see that in the old days too
[03:15:34.010 --> 03:15:36.010]  where they'd pop up and start making
[03:15:36.010 --> 03:15:38.010]  a little umbrella on top or something
[03:15:38.010 --> 03:15:40.010]  yeah it's a good time
[03:15:40.010 --> 03:15:42.010]  probably a time you know Kev could probably
[03:15:42.010 --> 03:15:44.010]  speak to this more it's probably a time
[03:15:44.010 --> 03:15:46.010]  you know timed of that temperature
[03:15:46.010 --> 03:15:48.010]  because where I live I get that temperature
[03:15:48.010 --> 03:15:50.010]  but it's only for 2 or 3 hours
[03:15:50.010 --> 03:15:52.010]  you know at best
[03:15:52.010 --> 03:15:54.010]  if I'm here
[03:15:54.010 --> 03:15:56.010]  you probably don't have a bad mildew
[03:15:56.230 --> 03:15:58.230]  problem while it is those temperatures
[03:15:58.230 --> 03:16:00.230]  when it drops below those temperatures
[03:16:00.230 --> 03:16:02.230]  and it's like 17 at
[03:16:02.230 --> 03:16:04.230]  night and 28 in the day or
[03:16:04.230 --> 03:16:06.230]  colder at night then mildew
[03:16:06.230 --> 03:16:08.230]  is really a problem like once you start getting
[03:16:08.230 --> 03:16:10.230]  the cool nights it's a
[03:16:10.230 --> 03:16:12.230]  bigger deal but if you can kill
[03:16:12.230 --> 03:16:14.230]  outdoors you can never get rid of it
[03:16:14.230 --> 03:16:16.230]  because it's always
[03:16:16.230 --> 03:16:18.230]  around you so their genetics is your
[03:16:18.230 --> 03:16:20.230]  main resistance well genetics
[03:16:20.230 --> 03:16:22.230]  and how healthy they are
[03:16:22.230 --> 03:16:24.230]  but some plants they just
[03:16:24.450 --> 03:16:26.450]  melt before any sign of mildew
[03:16:26.450 --> 03:16:28.450]  and some will stand up to it and not show it
[03:16:28.450 --> 03:16:30.450]  I'm always
[03:16:30.450 --> 03:16:32.450]  happy and I always take note of
[03:16:32.450 --> 03:16:34.450]  plants that are resistant to mildew
[03:16:34.450 --> 03:16:36.450]  because it's just a great
[03:16:36.450 --> 03:16:38.450]  feature you know
[03:16:38.450 --> 03:16:40.450]  and there's a couple
[03:16:40.450 --> 03:16:42.450]  tips you can do too if you're gonna do
[03:16:42.450 --> 03:16:44.450]  those heat treatments you can do things before
[03:16:44.450 --> 03:16:46.450]  to try to help your plants through that
[03:16:46.450 --> 03:16:48.450]  like if you're inside you could
[03:16:48.450 --> 03:16:50.450]  you could just run CO2
[03:16:50.450 --> 03:16:52.450]  you know increase the CO2 which is
[03:16:52.670 --> 03:16:54.670]  you know deal with it higher
[03:16:54.670 --> 03:16:56.670]  heat or if you're outside just
[03:16:56.670 --> 03:16:58.670]  make sure you plant it in the ground
[03:16:58.670 --> 03:17:00.670]  I don't know how many times I find people
[03:17:00.670 --> 03:17:02.670]  outside or plant it in pots on top of the ground
[03:17:02.670 --> 03:17:04.670]  it's like put them in the ground man because
[03:17:04.670 --> 03:17:06.670]  in the ground if the ground is cool
[03:17:06.670 --> 03:17:08.670]  then it'll help keep the plant cool
[03:17:08.670 --> 03:17:10.670]  when the root systems
[03:17:10.670 --> 03:17:12.670]  get bigger and they're just attached
[03:17:12.670 --> 03:17:14.670]  to the earth there's something
[03:17:14.670 --> 03:17:16.670]  totally different when you put them in the ground
[03:17:16.670 --> 03:17:18.670]  than leave them in the pot
[03:17:18.670 --> 03:17:20.670]  and it's generally in favor of the one in the
[03:17:20.890 --> 03:17:22.890]  ground you know
[03:17:22.890 --> 03:17:24.890]  that's for sure
[03:17:24.890 --> 03:17:26.890]  you see a tricker earlier in pots
[03:17:26.890 --> 03:17:28.890]  though the thing is like
[03:17:28.890 --> 03:17:30.890]  we had this discussion the other
[03:17:30.890 --> 03:17:32.890]  day that the plants that are in bags
[03:17:32.890 --> 03:17:34.890]  even though I like in the ground plants
[03:17:34.890 --> 03:17:36.890]  so much of the
[03:17:36.890 --> 03:17:38.890]  selection that we've made has been selected
[03:17:38.890 --> 03:17:40.890]  from bag
[03:17:40.890 --> 03:17:42.890]  the giant bags that you guys use in
[03:17:42.890 --> 03:17:44.890]  California now you don't see that
[03:17:44.890 --> 03:17:46.890]  up here as much because it's not as long
[03:17:46.890 --> 03:17:48.890]  a season really
[03:17:49.110 --> 03:17:51.110]  there's still people doing it that style here
[03:17:51.110 --> 03:17:53.110]  and we get the long days so we get
[03:17:53.110 --> 03:17:55.110]  veg and big plants
[03:17:55.110 --> 03:17:57.110]  I got some pretty good ones last year pretty big
[03:17:57.110 --> 03:17:59.110]  at least
[03:17:59.110 --> 03:18:01.110]  but in the ground
[03:18:01.110 --> 03:18:03.110]  if you failed to water
[03:18:03.110 --> 03:18:05.110]  it and that they just have more
[03:18:05.110 --> 03:18:07.110]  resilience you know to find their own water
[03:18:07.110 --> 03:18:09.110]  and stuff you know
[03:18:09.110 --> 03:18:11.110]  if you want to dry farm
[03:18:11.110 --> 03:18:13.110]  if you want to dry farm something you don't have a chance
[03:18:13.110 --> 03:18:15.110]  of doing that in pots
[03:18:15.110 --> 03:18:17.110]  but in the ground
[03:18:17.330 --> 03:18:19.330]  you don't have a chance of doing that
[03:18:19.330 --> 03:18:21.330]  and that to me is where you cross the line
[03:18:21.330 --> 03:18:23.330]  from horticulture to agriculture
[03:18:23.330 --> 03:18:25.330]  maybe where you don't even worry
[03:18:25.330 --> 03:18:27.330]  about the irrigation and you're just planting
[03:18:27.330 --> 03:18:29.330]  the field and hoping it's a good season
[03:18:29.330 --> 03:18:31.330]  yeah I know there's a guy
[03:18:31.330 --> 03:18:33.330]  from
[03:18:33.330 --> 03:18:35.330]  what's it Spring Creek Farms
[03:18:35.330 --> 03:18:37.330]  but Zellie does
[03:18:37.330 --> 03:18:39.330]  he has a high degree of organic matter
[03:18:39.330 --> 03:18:41.330]  in his soil through
[03:18:41.330 --> 03:18:43.330]  that he built over years but
[03:18:43.330 --> 03:18:45.330]  we were talking about his last year's run
[03:18:45.550 --> 03:18:47.550]  he didn't have to irrigate water for the last 35 days
[03:18:47.550 --> 03:18:49.550]  of the crop
[03:18:49.550 --> 03:18:51.550]  so for the entire month of October he didn't have to irrigate once
[03:18:51.550 --> 03:18:53.550]  and that's an incredible
[03:18:53.550 --> 03:18:55.550]  benefit in terms of drought
[03:18:55.550 --> 03:18:57.550]  time and for labor
[03:18:57.550 --> 03:18:59.550]  holy shit
[03:18:59.550 --> 03:19:01.550]  you guys
[03:19:01.550 --> 03:19:03.550]  I mean
[03:19:03.550 --> 03:19:05.550]  the amount of water I've
[03:19:05.550 --> 03:19:07.550]  dropped on my crop you guys saw
[03:19:07.550 --> 03:19:09.550]  the videos the other day
[03:19:09.550 --> 03:19:11.550]  it's so little
[03:19:11.550 --> 03:19:13.550]  the greenhouse has irrigation
[03:19:13.770 --> 03:19:15.770]  that's kind of a side but the outdoor
[03:19:15.770 --> 03:19:17.770]  I have overhead sprinklers
[03:19:17.770 --> 03:19:19.770]  and you just don't put that much
[03:19:19.770 --> 03:19:21.770]  water down like I run them for
[03:19:21.770 --> 03:19:23.770]  45 minutes an hour and like
[03:19:23.770 --> 03:19:25.770]  I stick my finger down and
[03:19:25.770 --> 03:19:27.770]  it's dry as a bone
[03:19:27.770 --> 03:19:29.770]  so they're sucking down
[03:19:29.770 --> 03:19:31.770]  into the natural aquifer
[03:19:31.770 --> 03:19:33.770]  and
[03:19:33.770 --> 03:19:35.770]  that's where they're getting it
[03:19:35.770 --> 03:19:37.770]  I don't have the hugest plants but they're
[03:19:37.770 --> 03:19:39.770]  4, 5, 6, I'm 6 feet tall
[03:19:39.770 --> 03:19:41.770]  these just outdoor kind of
[03:19:41.990 --> 03:19:43.990]  clones that I have out here
[03:19:43.990 --> 03:19:45.990]  and I'm pretty impressed dude
[03:19:45.990 --> 03:19:47.990]  I love the low effort stuff
[03:19:47.990 --> 03:19:49.990]  like low inputs
[03:19:49.990 --> 03:19:51.990]  low efforts
[03:19:51.990 --> 03:19:53.990]  to me that's where
[03:19:53.990 --> 03:19:55.990]  it gets interesting to me more than
[03:19:55.990 --> 03:19:57.990]  it's just like down in there so long
[03:19:57.990 --> 03:19:59.990]  you get jaded with it
[03:19:59.990 --> 03:20:01.990]  it's not much of a challenge
[03:20:01.990 --> 03:20:03.990]  it's just punching the clock
[03:20:03.990 --> 03:20:05.990]  almost you know
[03:20:05.990 --> 03:20:07.990]  it's
[03:20:07.990 --> 03:20:09.990]  just still beautiful
[03:20:10.210 --> 03:20:12.210]  beautiful grass
[03:20:12.210 --> 03:20:14.210]  I'm all for everybody however
[03:20:14.210 --> 03:20:16.210]  they like to do it that's fine
[03:20:16.210 --> 03:20:18.210]  but to me it's like
[03:20:18.210 --> 03:20:20.210]  how little can I put
[03:20:20.210 --> 03:20:22.210]  into that field to make it sparkle
[03:20:22.210 --> 03:20:24.210]  you know I just want
[03:20:24.210 --> 03:20:26.210]  to see that you know
[03:20:26.210 --> 03:20:28.210]  and make that
[03:20:28.210 --> 03:20:30.210]  make it that ubiquitous
[03:20:30.210 --> 03:20:32.210]  you know it's just a bucket list
[03:20:32.210 --> 03:20:34.210]  thing of mine that I want to drive a pond
[03:20:34.210 --> 03:20:36.210]  by and harvest
[03:20:36.210 --> 03:20:38.210]  you just seem like a guy who wants to
[03:20:38.430 --> 03:20:40.430]  kick back on a recliner and drink a lot
[03:20:40.430 --> 03:20:42.430]  of beer and smoke a lot of weed
[03:20:42.430 --> 03:20:44.430]  and grow a lot of fire with minimal
[03:20:44.430 --> 03:20:46.430]  effort
[03:20:46.430 --> 03:20:48.430]  that's true
[03:20:48.430 --> 03:20:50.430]  is that all of us?
[03:20:50.430 --> 03:20:52.430]  most of my summer
[03:20:52.430 --> 03:20:54.430]  on a floaty in the pool
[03:20:54.430 --> 03:20:56.430]  floating around my 8 or 9
[03:20:56.430 --> 03:20:58.430]  plants I had growing around the pool
[03:20:58.430 --> 03:21:00.430]  and it was just a glorious
[03:21:00.430 --> 03:21:02.430]  summer because I was like I literally
[03:21:02.430 --> 03:21:04.430]  can't go to work
[03:21:04.430 --> 03:21:06.430]  I can only work from here
[03:21:06.650 --> 03:21:08.650]  Steve, can you recline it for us?
[03:21:08.650 --> 03:21:10.650]  I hope I set the camera
[03:21:10.650 --> 03:21:12.650]  up well enough
[03:21:12.650 --> 03:21:14.650]  how's that?
[03:21:14.650 --> 03:21:16.650]  Steve's comfortable
[03:21:16.650 --> 03:21:18.650]  I find it interesting
[03:21:18.650 --> 03:21:20.650]  that we're talking about low effort
[03:21:20.650 --> 03:21:22.650]  and we're talking about these diseases
[03:21:22.650 --> 03:21:24.650]  and it
[03:21:24.650 --> 03:21:26.650]  reminds me a lot of
[03:21:26.650 --> 03:21:28.650]  a theory about
[03:21:28.650 --> 03:21:30.650]  who's driving
[03:21:30.650 --> 03:21:32.650]  is the person driving or the plant
[03:21:32.650 --> 03:21:34.650]  driving and I feel like when
[03:21:34.870 --> 03:21:36.870]  we push these plants too hard
[03:21:36.870 --> 03:21:38.870]  and we push them too fast we end up with
[03:21:38.870 --> 03:21:40.870]  the obese plants
[03:21:40.870 --> 03:21:42.870]  we end up with
[03:21:42.870 --> 03:21:44.870]  deficiencies in some areas, surpluses in other areas
[03:21:44.870 --> 03:21:46.870]  and
[03:21:46.870 --> 03:21:48.870]  that opens up the doors to bring in
[03:21:48.870 --> 03:21:50.870]  these pests and diseases
[03:21:50.870 --> 03:21:52.870]  and
[03:21:52.870 --> 03:21:54.870]  I feel like that's all related more to
[03:21:54.870 --> 03:21:56.870]  whether it's hydroponics
[03:21:56.870 --> 03:21:58.870]  or a living soil
[03:21:58.870 --> 03:22:00.870]  it's more aligned
[03:22:00.870 --> 03:22:02.870]  with the person driving
[03:22:03.090 --> 03:22:05.090]  and when you
[03:22:05.090 --> 03:22:07.090]  it's really hard but when you can relax
[03:22:07.090 --> 03:22:09.090]  as a farmer and let the plant take control
[03:22:09.090 --> 03:22:11.090]  it has a better job
[03:22:11.090 --> 03:22:13.090]  monitoring itself and we find
[03:22:13.090 --> 03:22:15.090]  this better health and we find this lush growth
[03:22:15.090 --> 03:22:17.090]  and we find it switching over
[03:22:17.090 --> 03:22:19.090]  properly
[03:22:19.090 --> 03:22:21.090]  so it just
[03:22:21.090 --> 03:22:23.090]  that's part of my theory when I was talking to you
[03:22:23.090 --> 03:22:25.090]  Kevin the other day about
[03:22:25.090 --> 03:22:27.090]  secondary metabolites
[03:22:27.090 --> 03:22:29.090]  and the stress
[03:22:29.090 --> 03:22:31.090]  that was the extreme of this concept
[03:22:31.310 --> 03:22:33.310]  I feel like there's a sweet spot in the middle there
[03:22:33.310 --> 03:22:35.310]  where we don't need to be driving them so hard
[03:22:35.310 --> 03:22:37.310]  but we need to give them
[03:22:37.310 --> 03:22:39.310]  the ability to drive themselves
[03:22:39.310 --> 03:22:41.310]  without
[03:22:41.310 --> 03:22:43.310]  something interesting you can
[03:22:43.310 --> 03:22:45.310]  go ahead
[03:22:45.310 --> 03:22:47.310]  I was just thinking again
[03:22:47.310 --> 03:22:49.310]  it's like a parallel with wine and grapes
[03:22:49.310 --> 03:22:51.310]  because the best yielding
[03:22:51.310 --> 03:22:53.310]  grapes never make the best wine
[03:22:53.310 --> 03:22:55.310]  right?
[03:22:55.310 --> 03:22:57.310]  the deficit irrigation
[03:22:57.310 --> 03:22:59.310]  and the plants not carrying too heavy
[03:22:59.530 --> 03:23:01.530]  a load
[03:23:01.530 --> 03:23:03.530]  otherwise those heavy yielding ones
[03:23:03.530 --> 03:23:05.530]  are full of water berries and stuff
[03:23:05.530 --> 03:23:07.530]  they might hit the requisite alcohol
[03:23:07.530 --> 03:23:09.530]  but they lack the flavor
[03:23:09.530 --> 03:23:11.530]  they don't have the intensity of flavor
[03:23:11.530 --> 03:23:13.530]  and they're the same
[03:23:13.530 --> 03:23:15.530]  compounds right?
[03:23:15.530 --> 03:23:17.530]  and I've seen it in growing oregano
[03:23:17.530 --> 03:23:19.530]  in a rich patch of my garden
[03:23:19.530 --> 03:23:21.530]  versus the same oregano that popped up
[03:23:21.530 --> 03:23:23.530]  in the sand beside it
[03:23:23.530 --> 03:23:25.530]  the difference is incredible
[03:23:25.530 --> 03:23:27.530]  the size of the oregano
[03:23:27.750 --> 03:23:29.750]  the oil and irrigation is 4 or 5 times bigger
[03:23:29.750 --> 03:23:31.750]  but the little stuff
[03:23:31.750 --> 03:23:33.750]  is spicy
[03:23:33.750 --> 03:23:35.750]  like pungent
[03:23:35.750 --> 03:23:37.750]  really spicy
[03:23:37.750 --> 03:23:39.750]  you just can't believe the difference
[03:23:39.750 --> 03:23:41.750]  in the dry deficit irrigation
[03:23:41.750 --> 03:23:43.750]  deficit nutrients
[03:23:43.750 --> 03:23:45.750]  the water stress
[03:23:45.750 --> 03:23:47.750]  is a thing in herbs
[03:23:47.750 --> 03:23:49.750]  and it's the same in the fruit growing
[03:23:49.750 --> 03:23:51.750]  too
[03:23:51.750 --> 03:23:53.750]  and cannabis is just part of that
[03:23:53.750 --> 03:23:55.750]  and it's absolutely valid
[03:23:55.970 --> 03:23:57.970]  it stands out a lot
[03:23:57.970 --> 03:23:59.970]  in the grape example
[03:23:59.970 --> 03:24:01.970]  because it's the difference between
[03:24:01.970 --> 03:24:03.970]  a fine wine grape
[03:24:03.970 --> 03:24:05.970]  and a Thompson seedless grape
[03:24:05.970 --> 03:24:07.970]  that hits your table
[03:24:07.970 --> 03:24:09.970]  they try to pump those things full of water
[03:24:09.970 --> 03:24:11.970]  because the consumer wants grapes as big as your thumb
[03:24:11.970 --> 03:24:13.970]  and they don't want them to be sweet
[03:24:13.970 --> 03:24:15.970]  they want a bit of acidity
[03:24:15.970 --> 03:24:17.970]  so those ones are like 17 bricks
[03:24:17.970 --> 03:24:19.970]  19 bricks
[03:24:19.970 --> 03:24:21.970]  they're in that range
[03:24:21.970 --> 03:24:23.970]  whereas a red wine grape might be
[03:24:24.190 --> 03:24:26.190]  like 26 bricks
[03:24:26.190 --> 03:24:28.190]  and even amongst those
[03:24:28.190 --> 03:24:30.190]  there's guys that will be cropping
[03:24:30.190 --> 03:24:32.190]  12 tons an acre
[03:24:32.190 --> 03:24:34.190]  and other guys that are cropping
[03:24:34.190 --> 03:24:36.190]  a ton an acre, 2 tons an acre
[03:24:36.190 --> 03:24:38.190]  and even at 4 tons
[03:24:38.190 --> 03:24:40.190]  is considered very respectable
[03:24:40.190 --> 03:24:42.190]  you know like ok
[03:24:42.190 --> 03:24:44.190]  you're not over cropping
[03:24:44.190 --> 03:24:46.190]  if you're doing up to 4 tons an acre
[03:24:46.190 --> 03:24:48.190]  but somebody that wants to make
[03:24:48.190 --> 03:24:50.190]  the most exceptional
[03:24:50.190 --> 03:24:52.190]  over the top robust bread
[03:24:52.410 --> 03:24:54.410]  they might say please
[03:24:54.410 --> 03:24:56.410]  I want you to crop it down to 2 tons an acre
[03:24:56.410 --> 03:24:58.410]  even though you know you're throwing away
[03:24:58.410 --> 03:25:00.410]  perfectly good fruit
[03:25:00.410 --> 03:25:02.410]  that would be pretty much just as good at 4 tons
[03:25:02.410 --> 03:25:04.410]  but they only want it to be said
[03:25:04.410 --> 03:25:06.410]  that that place only
[03:25:06.410 --> 03:25:08.410]  put out 2 tons of fruit an acre
[03:25:08.410 --> 03:25:10.410]  and it's more intense because it's
[03:25:10.410 --> 03:25:12.410]  concentrated in that rather than a bunch
[03:25:12.410 --> 03:25:14.410]  of little water balloons all over them
[03:25:14.410 --> 03:25:16.410]  so you can see
[03:25:16.410 --> 03:25:18.410]  I see the same thing as somebody had asked earlier
[03:25:18.410 --> 03:25:20.410]  about the hydro
[03:25:20.630 --> 03:25:22.630]  and I see it that way too
[03:25:22.630 --> 03:25:24.630]  you can have water balloons
[03:25:24.630 --> 03:25:26.630]  or you can do a really good job
[03:25:26.630 --> 03:25:28.630]  I've done a great job doing hydro
[03:25:28.630 --> 03:25:30.630]  long ago like when I first started
[03:25:30.630 --> 03:25:32.630]  indoor growing I made a point of trying
[03:25:32.630 --> 03:25:34.630]  every type of growing
[03:25:34.630 --> 03:25:36.630]  whether it was deep water culture
[03:25:36.630 --> 03:25:38.630]  or NFT or whatever
[03:25:38.630 --> 03:25:40.630]  I did them all
[03:25:40.630 --> 03:25:42.630]  and I used some very refined nutrients as well
[03:25:42.630 --> 03:25:44.630]  and I love that you can do
[03:25:44.630 --> 03:25:46.630]  beautiful hydro and flush it clean
[03:25:46.630 --> 03:25:48.630]  or the plants yellow
[03:25:48.850 --> 03:25:50.850]  you get a really light
[03:25:50.850 --> 03:25:52.850]  texture of smoke
[03:25:52.850 --> 03:25:54.850]  because you don't get the influences of the other
[03:25:54.850 --> 03:25:56.850]  soil inputs and stuff
[03:25:56.850 --> 03:25:58.850]  that's never going to be flushed
[03:25:58.850 --> 03:26:00.850]  and used up totally
[03:26:00.850 --> 03:26:02.850]  the hydro can give you
[03:26:02.850 --> 03:26:04.850]  the main difference I see in hydro
[03:26:04.850 --> 03:26:06.850]  I don't see much hydro anymore
[03:26:06.850 --> 03:26:08.850]  but it used to
[03:26:08.850 --> 03:26:10.850]  be in Ontario and BC
[03:26:10.850 --> 03:26:12.850]  it would be more of a hard water, soft water
[03:26:12.850 --> 03:26:14.850]  thing so everybody's using
[03:26:14.850 --> 03:26:16.850]  the nutrients that
[03:26:17.070 --> 03:26:19.070]  hydro would sell which most of the people were using
[03:26:19.070 --> 03:26:21.070]  would be a different blend
[03:26:21.070 --> 03:26:23.070]  whether it was for sale in a hard water
[03:26:23.070 --> 03:26:25.070]  area or a soft water area
[03:26:25.070 --> 03:26:27.070]  that was the main distinction
[03:26:27.070 --> 03:26:29.070]  but other than that you got the real varietal
[03:26:29.070 --> 03:26:31.070]  flavour of whatever you were growing
[03:26:31.070 --> 03:26:33.070]  whereas whenever you're growing
[03:26:33.070 --> 03:26:35.070]  it in a living soil you're kind of
[03:26:35.070 --> 03:26:37.070]  building your own terroir
[03:26:37.070 --> 03:26:39.070]  and that never
[03:26:39.070 --> 03:26:41.070]  disappears, that's part of your fingerprint
[03:26:41.070 --> 03:26:43.070]  on that batch
[03:26:43.070 --> 03:26:45.070]  so that's a beautiful thing
[03:26:45.290 --> 03:26:47.290]  I love building up the soil too
[03:26:47.290 --> 03:26:49.290]  you can come with it anyway
[03:26:49.290 --> 03:26:51.290]  whether the hard water was better
[03:26:51.290 --> 03:26:53.290]  than the soft water or the soft water
[03:26:53.290 --> 03:26:55.290]  was better than the hard water because that's directly
[03:26:55.290 --> 03:26:57.290]  related to the mineral content in the water
[03:26:57.290 --> 03:26:59.290]  that's it
[03:26:59.290 --> 03:27:01.290]  I don't remember
[03:27:01.290 --> 03:27:03.290]  honestly I could tell you
[03:27:03.290 --> 03:27:05.290]  which one came from which
[03:27:05.290 --> 03:27:07.290]  province
[03:27:07.290 --> 03:27:09.290]  and I think it was
[03:27:09.290 --> 03:27:11.290]  when I mixed them up all the time
[03:27:11.290 --> 03:27:13.290]  it was slightly returning
[03:27:13.510 --> 03:27:15.510]  more than soil
[03:27:17.510 --> 03:27:19.510]  it's been a long time
[03:27:19.510 --> 03:27:21.510]  literally decades since I
[03:27:21.510 --> 03:27:23.510]  was looking at hydrangeas
[03:27:23.510 --> 03:27:25.510]  anybody really
[03:27:25.510 --> 03:27:27.510]  because everybody I know that is growing
[03:27:27.510 --> 03:27:29.510]  is just
[03:27:29.510 --> 03:27:31.510]  growing in their own soil
[03:27:31.510 --> 03:27:33.510]  basically I don't know anybody
[03:27:33.510 --> 03:27:35.510]  growing hydrangea anymore
[03:27:35.510 --> 03:27:37.510]  so just quickly Steve
[03:27:37.510 --> 03:27:39.510]  first of all you look very comfortable
[03:27:39.510 --> 03:27:41.510]  and
[03:27:41.730 --> 03:27:43.730]  your audio on zoom
[03:27:43.730 --> 03:27:45.730]  has been like an accordion where sometimes
[03:27:45.730 --> 03:27:47.730]  you sound super slurred and drunk
[03:27:47.730 --> 03:27:49.730]  because it's super slow and drawn out
[03:27:49.730 --> 03:27:51.730]  and then other times
[03:27:51.730 --> 03:27:53.730]  it compresses
[03:27:53.730 --> 03:27:55.730]  and you sound like you're on
[03:27:55.730 --> 03:27:57.730]  meth and you're like
[03:27:57.730 --> 03:27:59.730]  super speedy talking
[03:27:59.730 --> 03:28:01.730]  anyway
[03:28:01.730 --> 03:28:03.730]  that's weird
[03:28:03.730 --> 03:28:05.730]  we're just going to have the
[03:28:08.730 --> 03:28:10.730]  I'm wearing earplugs but I've been just
[03:28:10.950 --> 03:28:12.950]  wearing one at a time
[03:28:12.950 --> 03:28:14.950]  so that the battery doesn't die on both of them
[03:28:14.950 --> 03:28:16.950]  I wear one for an hour and change
[03:28:16.950 --> 03:28:18.950]  the other one out
[03:28:18.950 --> 03:28:20.950]  I seriously was wondering how
[03:28:20.950 --> 03:28:22.950]  you're going so long on those ear buds
[03:28:22.950 --> 03:28:24.950]  because we do interviews with these people
[03:28:24.950 --> 03:28:26.950]  and they die out
[03:28:26.950 --> 03:28:28.950]  every day I do a couple hours
[03:28:28.950 --> 03:28:30.950]  of conference calls every morning almost
[03:28:30.950 --> 03:28:32.950]  and that is the trick
[03:28:32.950 --> 03:28:34.950]  you have to alternate and just wear one ear pod
[03:28:34.950 --> 03:28:36.950]  at a time
[03:28:36.950 --> 03:28:40.290]  that's the only way
[03:28:40.510 --> 03:28:42.510]  I'm going back to what we were talking about
[03:28:42.510 --> 03:28:44.510]  with the wines
[03:28:44.510 --> 03:28:46.510]  I formed my own theory on the living soil
[03:28:46.510 --> 03:28:48.510]  versus hydroponic
[03:28:48.510 --> 03:28:50.510]  I actually work
[03:28:50.510 --> 03:28:52.510]  in hydroponic grow
[03:28:52.510 --> 03:28:54.510]  and then at home I grow organically
[03:28:54.510 --> 03:28:56.510]  but I think
[03:28:56.510 --> 03:28:58.510]  there's two factors
[03:28:58.510 --> 03:29:00.510]  the reason why we find
[03:29:00.510 --> 03:29:02.510]  in living soils
[03:29:02.510 --> 03:29:04.510]  secondary metabolites
[03:29:04.510 --> 03:29:06.510]  are higher
[03:29:06.510 --> 03:29:08.510]  and I think it's for
[03:29:08.730 --> 03:29:10.730]  one I think it's the whole NPK thing
[03:29:10.730 --> 03:29:12.730]  whereas in synthetics
[03:29:12.730 --> 03:29:14.730]  if you follow the history of it after World War 2
[03:29:14.730 --> 03:29:16.730]  or whatever
[03:29:16.730 --> 03:29:18.730]  originally we were thinking it was only the NPK
[03:29:18.730 --> 03:29:20.730]  is what plants needed
[03:29:20.730 --> 03:29:22.730]  it just keeps adding
[03:29:22.730 --> 03:29:24.730]  originally it was 3, then it was 4, then it was 8
[03:29:24.730 --> 03:29:26.730]  then it was 16
[03:29:26.730 --> 03:29:28.730]  it keeps going on and on
[03:29:28.730 --> 03:29:30.730]  my point is in the living soil hopefully
[03:29:30.730 --> 03:29:32.730]  you've got all those things and more
[03:29:32.730 --> 03:29:34.730]  I think they're up to 32 now
[03:29:34.730 --> 03:29:36.730]  different nutrients
[03:29:36.950 --> 03:29:38.950]  I think Ms. Coop brought this up on another episode
[03:29:38.950 --> 03:29:40.950]  kelp for example
[03:29:40.950 --> 03:29:42.950]  you can get up to 80
[03:29:42.950 --> 03:29:44.950]  they found 83
[03:29:44.950 --> 03:29:46.950]  different elements in that
[03:29:46.950 --> 03:29:48.950]  so we know a plant can at least uptake 83 elements
[03:29:48.950 --> 03:29:50.950]  but we're only supplying them with
[03:29:50.950 --> 03:29:52.950]  not even half of that
[03:29:52.950 --> 03:29:54.950]  in a hydroponic setting
[03:29:54.950 --> 03:29:56.950]  the other thing is from the wine industry
[03:29:56.950 --> 03:29:58.950]  there's an old saying
[03:30:00.950 --> 03:30:02.950]  to make great wine
[03:30:02.950 --> 03:30:04.950]  the grape first must suffer
[03:30:05.170 --> 03:30:07.170]  so I think you have to stress your plants
[03:30:07.170 --> 03:30:09.170]  everybody's so worried about stressing plants
[03:30:09.170 --> 03:30:11.170]  I think you have to have some stress
[03:30:11.170 --> 03:30:13.170]  like what you were explaining with
[03:30:13.170 --> 03:30:15.170]  all the different plants
[03:30:15.170 --> 03:30:17.170]  it might not be the best yield
[03:30:17.170 --> 03:30:19.170]  but that stress caused the secondary metabolites
[03:30:19.170 --> 03:30:21.170]  to really push out more
[03:30:21.170 --> 03:30:23.170]  in Canada the best
[03:30:23.170 --> 03:30:25.170]  I've seen it once was with
[03:30:25.170 --> 03:30:27.170]  blockhead where I had an entire
[03:30:27.170 --> 03:30:29.170]  greenhouse of blockhead
[03:30:29.170 --> 03:30:31.170]  where it was very richly fed
[03:30:31.170 --> 03:30:33.170]  and when we planted the greenhouse
[03:30:33.390 --> 03:30:35.390]  there was one extra clone
[03:30:35.390 --> 03:30:37.390]  left over and I just went
[03:30:37.390 --> 03:30:39.390]  and stuck it in a meadow behind the greenhouse
[03:30:39.390 --> 03:30:41.390]  where it was just left dry farmed
[03:30:41.390 --> 03:30:43.390]  no, didn't dig
[03:30:43.390 --> 03:30:45.390]  it a hole or anything just like a tree plant
[03:30:45.390 --> 03:30:47.390]  I just give it a little wedge and stuck
[03:30:47.390 --> 03:30:49.390]  the clone in and closed it
[03:30:49.390 --> 03:30:51.390]  and that thing survived because there was enough
[03:30:51.390 --> 03:30:53.390]  rain in that area, it wouldn't
[03:30:53.390 --> 03:30:55.390]  in some of the drier places but
[03:30:55.390 --> 03:30:57.390]  there it was enough and it grew into
[03:30:57.390 --> 03:30:59.390]  maybe a five footer but it was
[03:30:59.390 --> 03:31:01.390]  very sparse whereas the blockheads
[03:31:01.610 --> 03:31:03.610]  inside were like
[03:31:03.610 --> 03:31:05.610]  double weight coke cans
[03:31:05.610 --> 03:31:07.610]  all the tops, they were big flat
[03:31:07.610 --> 03:31:09.610]  tops, flowers
[03:31:09.610 --> 03:31:11.610]  not rock hard but
[03:31:11.610 --> 03:31:13.610]  not super light fluffy either
[03:31:13.610 --> 03:31:15.610]  they were just sort of medium
[03:31:15.610 --> 03:31:17.610]  firm let's say
[03:31:17.610 --> 03:31:19.610]  but they were substantial and very heavy
[03:31:19.610 --> 03:31:21.610]  yielding whereas this one I back
[03:31:21.610 --> 03:31:23.610]  was wispy in comparison
[03:31:23.610 --> 03:31:25.610]  but which one do you think I smoked
[03:31:25.610 --> 03:31:27.610]  you know, that one plant
[03:31:27.610 --> 03:31:29.610]  went in a bag and once I had
[03:31:29.830 --> 03:31:31.830]  one joint of it, it was
[03:31:31.830 --> 03:31:33.830]  the real, you know, that had
[03:31:33.830 --> 03:31:35.830]  the flavor you start with
[03:31:35.830 --> 03:31:37.830]  would maintain, you know
[03:31:37.830 --> 03:31:39.830]  it wouldn't get so tarry as the ones
[03:31:39.830 --> 03:31:41.830]  that are fed well and they get very
[03:31:41.830 --> 03:31:43.830]  green and bigger
[03:31:43.830 --> 03:31:45.830]  if they don't get enough time to flush
[03:31:45.830 --> 03:31:47.830]  at the end, they'll always be a little
[03:31:47.830 --> 03:31:49.830]  heavier, you know, and they'll
[03:31:49.830 --> 03:31:51.830]  have a tarrier smoke, you know, a heavier
[03:31:51.830 --> 03:31:53.830]  texture whereas the ones that finish
[03:31:53.830 --> 03:31:55.830]  to the point that they're very golden
[03:31:55.830 --> 03:31:57.830]  and light green
[03:31:59.830 --> 03:32:01.830]  if they're
[03:32:01.830 --> 03:32:03.830]  through decently, the texture
[03:32:03.830 --> 03:32:05.830]  of those smokes can be ethereal
[03:32:05.830 --> 03:32:07.830]  but it's just so airy and light
[03:32:07.830 --> 03:32:09.830]  you know, so yeah, yielded
[03:32:09.830 --> 03:32:11.830]  a fraction of what the same
[03:32:11.830 --> 03:32:13.830]  clone would have had it been planted
[03:32:13.830 --> 03:32:15.830]  50 feet over in the tunnel with
[03:32:15.830 --> 03:32:17.830]  food and water but then
[03:32:17.830 --> 03:32:19.830]  it did in the meadow but it was
[03:32:19.830 --> 03:32:21.830]  way nicer to puff, you know
[03:32:21.830 --> 03:32:23.830]  and the other stuff was
[03:32:23.830 --> 03:32:25.830]  rock star bud by anybody's measure
[03:32:25.830 --> 03:32:27.830]  they would just be like, oh my god, this is intense
[03:32:28.050 --> 03:32:30.050]  and they were all happy, I'm sure mine didn't
[03:32:30.050 --> 03:32:32.050]  get me any higher but that
[03:32:32.050 --> 03:32:34.050]  one plant, it was so light
[03:32:34.050 --> 03:32:36.050]  to smoke and that's why I think
[03:32:36.050 --> 03:32:38.050]  the pre-rolled market could be great
[03:32:38.050 --> 03:32:40.050]  because people
[03:32:40.050 --> 03:32:42.050]  a lot of the pot is judged
[03:32:42.050 --> 03:32:44.050]  by appearance and cosmetics
[03:32:44.050 --> 03:32:46.050]  right, it's all aesthetics
[03:32:46.050 --> 03:32:48.050]  and the, you know, a clumped frosty
[03:32:48.050 --> 03:32:50.050]  bud has so much appeal
[03:32:50.050 --> 03:32:52.050]  whereas a wispy bud, people
[03:32:52.050 --> 03:32:54.050]  are instantly suspicious of it
[03:32:54.050 --> 03:32:56.050]  but rolled up, you know
[03:32:56.270 --> 03:32:58.270]  but they really go by
[03:32:58.270 --> 03:33:00.270]  the quality of what's in the paper
[03:33:00.270 --> 03:33:02.270]  not what it looks like, right
[03:33:02.270 --> 03:33:04.270]  and I know that there's lots
[03:33:04.270 --> 03:33:06.270]  of stuff that is often
[03:33:06.270 --> 03:33:08.270]  not quite as aesthetically pleasing
[03:33:08.270 --> 03:33:10.270]  but might be incredibly
[03:33:10.270 --> 03:33:12.270]  delicious once
[03:33:12.270 --> 03:33:14.270]  it's twisted up
[03:33:14.270 --> 03:33:16.270]  the books and covers, right
[03:33:16.270 --> 03:33:18.270]  everybody was
[03:33:18.270 --> 03:33:20.270]  judging the books by the covers
[03:33:20.270 --> 03:33:22.270]  that's so irritating to me
[03:33:22.270 --> 03:33:24.270]  working in the industry, it's, I mean
[03:33:24.490 --> 03:33:26.490]  we get some great, like biscotti
[03:33:26.490 --> 03:33:28.490]  for example, this is a great example, we brought
[03:33:28.490 --> 03:33:30.490]  a plant in biscotti
[03:33:30.490 --> 03:33:32.490]  because we heard that it was really good
[03:33:32.490 --> 03:33:34.490]  and we were going to try it out, so we just grew one of them
[03:33:34.490 --> 03:33:36.490]  on the end of one of our tables, you know
[03:33:36.490 --> 03:33:38.490]  and 150 other plants in there
[03:33:38.490 --> 03:33:40.490]  and we just
[03:33:40.490 --> 03:33:42.490]  sampled it ourselves to see what we thought of it
[03:33:42.490 --> 03:33:44.490]  everybody loved it
[03:33:44.490 --> 03:33:46.490]  it came back with testing that was like
[03:33:46.490 --> 03:33:48.490]  17% THC and
[03:33:48.490 --> 03:33:50.490]  the owner wouldn't even allow us to run it
[03:33:50.490 --> 03:33:52.490]  because the THC numbers
[03:33:52.710 --> 03:33:54.710]  were so low that it wouldn't sell at a dispensary
[03:33:54.710 --> 03:33:56.710]  it won't sell, people, yeah they won't buy
[03:33:56.710 --> 03:33:58.710]  buy flavour
[03:33:58.710 --> 03:34:00.710]  as easily as they will buy
[03:34:00.710 --> 03:34:02.710]  THC percentage, because it's almost
[03:34:02.710 --> 03:34:04.710]  like when they, you know
[03:34:04.710 --> 03:34:06.710]  some people would be looking at
[03:34:06.710 --> 03:34:08.710]  the alcohol on
[03:34:08.710 --> 03:34:10.710]  a bottle of wine or a bottle of
[03:34:10.710 --> 03:34:12.710]  vodka or whatever and they'll want the strongest
[03:34:12.710 --> 03:34:14.710]  rum, they think
[03:34:14.710 --> 03:34:16.710]  151 or whatever
[03:34:16.710 --> 03:34:18.710]  they want to give you the strongest
[03:34:18.710 --> 03:34:20.710]  one, and that doesn't
[03:34:20.930 --> 03:34:22.930]  have anything to do with the
[03:34:22.930 --> 03:34:24.930]  calibre of it, you know
[03:34:24.930 --> 03:34:26.930]  it's a whole other story
[03:34:26.930 --> 03:34:28.930]  doesn't that come back to that about consumer
[03:34:28.930 --> 03:34:30.930]  education there again, about the chirping
[03:34:30.930 --> 03:34:32.930]  profiles, like not enough people just really
[03:34:32.930 --> 03:34:34.930]  understand the chirping profiles
[03:34:34.930 --> 03:34:36.930]  and when you name a
[03:34:36.930 --> 03:34:38.930]  rosin or a
[03:34:38.930 --> 03:34:40.930]  butter hash or a bubble
[03:34:40.930 --> 03:34:42.930]  hash rosin and it's strawberry
[03:34:42.930 --> 03:34:44.930]  OG, and I go in there and I'm
[03:34:44.930 --> 03:34:46.930]  a consumer, I'm thinking this is going to taste like strawberry
[03:34:46.930 --> 03:34:48.930]  it don't taste like strawberry
[03:34:49.150 --> 03:34:51.150]  if I'm new
[03:34:51.150 --> 03:34:53.150]  and it don't taste like strawberry, well how are they going to buy
[03:34:53.150 --> 03:34:55.150]  by the chirping profiles when they can't smell it
[03:34:55.150 --> 03:34:57.150]  yeah, I mean
[03:34:57.150 --> 03:34:59.150]  it's not
[03:34:59.150 --> 03:35:01.150]  honestly I had some fantastic
[03:35:01.150 --> 03:35:03.150]  as they call
[03:35:03.150 --> 03:35:05.150]  six star ice wax
[03:35:05.150 --> 03:35:07.150]  from an Ontario producer
[03:35:07.150 --> 03:35:09.150]  actually that had sent some to Vancouver
[03:35:09.150 --> 03:35:11.150]  and it was going for astronomical
[03:35:11.150 --> 03:35:13.150]  numbers, and it wasn't like
[03:35:13.150 --> 03:35:15.150]  I was going to buy any, but they were
[03:35:15.150 --> 03:35:17.150]  selling it for like
[03:35:17.370 --> 03:35:19.370]  180 bucks a gram or something
[03:35:19.370 --> 03:35:21.370]  like that at the dispensary
[03:35:21.370 --> 03:35:23.370]  at a friend's
[03:35:23.370 --> 03:35:25.370]  friends and friends
[03:35:25.370 --> 03:35:27.370]  and so they said oh you've got to try
[03:35:27.370 --> 03:35:29.370]  this and just get it in like twice
[03:35:29.370 --> 03:35:31.370]  a year or something, and it was
[03:35:31.370 --> 03:35:33.370]  a strawberry banana genetics
[03:35:33.370 --> 03:35:35.370]  from DNA
[03:35:35.370 --> 03:35:37.370]  genetics from a strawberry banana
[03:35:37.370 --> 03:35:39.370]  and it was perfect
[03:35:39.370 --> 03:35:41.370]  you could squeeze it out
[03:35:41.370 --> 03:35:43.370]  it was a nice hash
[03:35:43.370 --> 03:35:45.370]  that you could squeeze out and dab
[03:35:45.590 --> 03:35:47.590]  and it would come out cleanly just like you would a rosin
[03:35:47.590 --> 03:35:49.590]  and it was perfect
[03:35:49.590 --> 03:35:51.590]  but it really did
[03:35:51.590 --> 03:35:53.590]  have strawberry and banana
[03:35:53.590 --> 03:35:55.590]  flavours, I was happy to see that
[03:35:55.590 --> 03:35:57.590]  okay
[03:35:57.590 --> 03:35:59.590]  Peter, you just
[03:35:59.590 --> 03:36:01.590]  have to screen share Kevin right now
[03:36:01.590 --> 03:36:03.590]  because he's got his cutest little baby
[03:36:03.590 --> 03:36:05.590]  out here right now
[03:36:05.590 --> 03:36:07.590]  Kevin say something, everybody's missing your little one
[03:36:07.590 --> 03:36:09.590]  there you go
[03:36:09.810 --> 03:36:11.810]  awww
[03:36:11.810 --> 03:36:13.810]  I was going to say
[03:36:13.810 --> 03:36:15.810]  for consumer
[03:36:15.810 --> 03:36:17.810]  education there's actually a study that just
[03:36:17.810 --> 03:36:19.810]  came out of the University of Colorado
[03:36:19.810 --> 03:36:21.810]  I believe it was on cannabinoids
[03:36:21.810 --> 03:36:23.810]  and they did a blind
[03:36:23.810 --> 03:36:25.810]  study with people
[03:36:25.810 --> 03:36:27.810]  that were concentrate users
[03:36:27.810 --> 03:36:29.810]  and people that were flower users
[03:36:29.810 --> 03:36:31.810]  and they gave them different
[03:36:31.810 --> 03:36:33.810]  percentages of THC
[03:36:33.810 --> 03:36:35.810]  and then they took
[03:36:35.810 --> 03:36:37.810]  a bunch of data afterwards
[03:36:38.030 --> 03:36:40.030]  and had the people gauge how high they got
[03:36:40.030 --> 03:36:42.030]  from that particular flower or that particular
[03:36:42.030 --> 03:36:44.030]  concentrate and what they found
[03:36:44.030 --> 03:36:46.030]  definitively was that the THC
[03:36:46.030 --> 03:36:48.030]  percentage, the higher the
[03:36:48.030 --> 03:36:50.030]  THC did not equate
[03:36:50.030 --> 03:36:52.030]  to a higher high
[03:36:52.030 --> 03:36:54.030]  so the people that were smoking an
[03:36:54.030 --> 03:36:56.030]  89% rosin did not get
[03:36:56.030 --> 03:36:58.030]  higher than the people that were smoking
[03:36:58.030 --> 03:37:00.030]  a 65% rosin
[03:37:00.030 --> 03:37:02.030]  same thing with the flower, the 17%
[03:37:02.030 --> 03:37:04.030]  flower did not get people less
[03:37:04.030 --> 03:37:06.030]  high than the 30%
[03:37:06.250 --> 03:37:08.250]  I read the same study
[03:37:08.250 --> 03:37:10.250]  I read the same study
[03:37:10.250 --> 03:37:12.250]  it was great
[03:37:12.250 --> 03:37:14.250]  it was a really great study to finally come
[03:37:14.250 --> 03:37:16.250]  out to show consumers that this is
[03:37:16.250 --> 03:37:18.250]  not about THC and we now
[03:37:18.250 --> 03:37:20.250]  have studies that are backing that up
[03:37:20.250 --> 03:37:22.250]  so it's a great one to
[03:37:22.250 --> 03:37:24.250]  push out on all the channels and really get
[03:37:24.250 --> 03:37:26.250]  people aware that this is a
[03:37:26.250 --> 03:37:28.250]  silly conversation, it's sativa vs
[03:37:28.250 --> 03:37:30.250]  indica, it's not exactly
[03:37:30.250 --> 03:37:32.250]  the right info
[03:37:32.250 --> 03:37:34.250]  that's right
[03:37:34.470 --> 03:37:36.470]  the sativa vs indica thing
[03:37:36.470 --> 03:37:38.470]  we all know it's wrong
[03:37:38.470 --> 03:37:40.470]  but it's so ingrained
[03:37:40.470 --> 03:37:42.470]  it's just
[03:37:42.470 --> 03:37:44.470]  reflexive
[03:37:44.470 --> 03:37:46.470]  the older you are the more reflexive it is
[03:37:46.470 --> 03:37:48.470]  for you too
[03:37:48.470 --> 03:37:50.470]  that study
[03:37:50.470 --> 03:37:52.470]  I remember reading it and having a few questions
[03:37:52.470 --> 03:37:54.470]  because it's pretty subjective
[03:37:54.470 --> 03:37:56.470]  as to
[03:37:56.470 --> 03:37:58.470]  how people explain
[03:37:58.470 --> 03:38:00.470]  how high they are
[03:38:00.470 --> 03:38:02.470]  there's not a highness scale
[03:38:02.690 --> 03:38:04.690]  it's not like they're in the medical units
[03:38:04.690 --> 03:38:06.690]  or something
[03:38:06.690 --> 03:38:08.690]  but it's interesting
[03:38:08.690 --> 03:38:10.690]  because
[03:38:10.690 --> 03:38:12.690]  all bets are off for edibles
[03:38:12.690 --> 03:38:14.690]  which makes sense
[03:38:14.690 --> 03:38:16.690]  because lots of times you puff
[03:38:16.690 --> 03:38:18.690]  you hit that ceiling
[03:38:18.690 --> 03:38:20.690]  and that's really as far as you're going to go puffing
[03:38:20.690 --> 03:38:22.690]  whereas you can take edibles
[03:38:22.690 --> 03:38:24.690]  and be on a 3 day bender
[03:38:24.690 --> 03:38:26.690]  where it's absolutely
[03:38:26.690 --> 03:38:28.690]  psychedelic, you're hallucinating
[03:38:28.690 --> 03:38:30.690]  and hearing voices and it's a whole other level
[03:38:30.910 --> 03:38:32.910]  I have to say about 11 o'clock
[03:38:32.910 --> 03:38:34.910]  this morning actually
[03:38:34.910 --> 03:38:36.910]  I'm coming down now
[03:38:36.910 --> 03:38:38.910]  it's beautiful
[03:38:38.910 --> 03:38:40.910]  I love edibles, honestly if I had to choose
[03:38:40.910 --> 03:38:42.910]  if I could only
[03:38:42.910 --> 03:38:44.910]  inhale or vape
[03:38:44.910 --> 03:38:46.910]  vs edibles
[03:38:46.910 --> 03:38:48.910]  I would take edibles
[03:38:48.910 --> 03:38:50.910]  honestly I know you lose
[03:38:50.910 --> 03:38:52.910]  the sensory which I really dig
[03:38:52.910 --> 03:38:54.910]  I love the smell and taste
[03:38:54.910 --> 03:38:56.910]  but I love the feeling of
[03:38:56.910 --> 03:38:58.910]  edibles and that full body feeling
[03:38:59.130 --> 03:39:01.130]  and it's such a basic thing
[03:39:01.130 --> 03:39:03.130]  that you can just make an infusion
[03:39:03.130 --> 03:39:05.130]  and cooking oil with some back yard
[03:39:05.130 --> 03:39:07.130]  home grown even if it's only
[03:39:07.130 --> 03:39:09.130]  halfway finished, whatever
[03:39:09.130 --> 03:39:11.130]  you can make something out of it
[03:39:11.130 --> 03:39:13.130]  and it's just
[03:39:13.130 --> 03:39:15.130]  it's
[03:39:15.130 --> 03:39:17.130]  for everybody
[03:39:17.130 --> 03:39:19.130]  you can take a little, you can take a lot
[03:39:19.130 --> 03:39:21.130]  you can get the full rate
[03:39:21.130 --> 03:39:23.130]  like I can get higher with some basic
[03:39:23.130 --> 03:39:25.130]  cooking oil than I can
[03:39:25.130 --> 03:39:27.130]  with the fanciest Babrig
[03:39:27.350 --> 03:39:29.350]  it always puts it into perspective
[03:39:29.350 --> 03:39:31.350]  for me, I love a delicious dad
[03:39:31.350 --> 03:39:33.350]  don't get me wrong, I appreciate
[03:39:33.350 --> 03:39:35.350]  beautiful ribs and what not
[03:39:35.350 --> 03:39:37.350]  but it's so simple
[03:39:37.350 --> 03:39:39.350]  it's really just cooking oil
[03:39:39.350 --> 03:39:41.350]  if you need it and you're rich
[03:39:41.350 --> 03:39:43.350]  or medicated however
[03:39:43.350 --> 03:39:45.350]  you need it
[03:39:45.350 --> 03:39:47.350]  Steve, you look
[03:39:47.350 --> 03:39:49.350]  like a man who enjoys the finer
[03:39:49.350 --> 03:39:51.350]  things in life, I think
[03:39:51.350 --> 03:39:53.350]  what I'd like to see
[03:39:53.350 --> 03:39:55.350]  in your
[03:39:55.570 --> 03:39:57.570]  comfortableness in this
[03:39:57.570 --> 03:39:59.570]  conversation is for you
[03:39:59.570 --> 03:40:01.570]  to move to the pool
[03:40:01.570 --> 03:40:03.570]  is that
[03:40:03.570 --> 03:40:05.570]  feasible? Well I could
[03:40:05.570 --> 03:40:07.570]  do it but you know the sun's starting
[03:40:07.570 --> 03:40:09.570]  to go behind the mountain
[03:40:09.570 --> 03:40:11.570]  now it's not as nice as it was
[03:40:11.570 --> 03:40:13.570]  although I could do it
[03:40:15.570 --> 03:40:17.570]  It may not be optimal
[03:40:17.570 --> 03:40:19.570]  but Kevin has
[03:40:19.570 --> 03:40:21.570]  his baby
[03:40:21.570 --> 03:40:23.570]  that's his money shot, we need
[03:40:23.790 --> 03:40:25.790]  to see you floating in the pool
[03:40:25.790 --> 03:40:27.790]  if I must, but you'll have to give me
[03:40:27.790 --> 03:40:29.790]  a minute to go and throw on
[03:40:29.790 --> 03:40:31.790]  my suit here
[03:40:31.790 --> 03:40:33.790]  or this will become a
[03:40:33.790 --> 03:40:35.790]  video
[03:40:35.790 --> 03:40:37.790]  so while
[03:40:37.790 --> 03:40:39.790]  Steve puts on his bathing suit
[03:40:39.790 --> 03:40:41.790]  Wendy, someone
[03:40:41.790 --> 03:40:43.790]  asked how you control pests
[03:40:43.790 --> 03:40:45.790]  and diseases with JADAM
[03:40:49.790 --> 03:40:51.790]  this is kind of a two-fold question
[03:40:52.010 --> 03:40:54.010]  Korean natural farming and JADAM
[03:40:54.010 --> 03:40:56.010]  are very different, people tend to equate
[03:40:56.010 --> 03:40:58.010]  them as one and the same but they're really not
[03:40:58.010 --> 03:41:00.010]  they both work equally well
[03:41:00.010 --> 03:41:02.010]  it's a different mentality
[03:41:02.010 --> 03:41:04.010]  I prefer
[03:41:04.010 --> 03:41:06.010]  natural farming, there's really
[03:41:06.010 --> 03:41:08.010]  an intention that goes with
[03:41:08.010 --> 03:41:10.010]  natural farming, it's almost
[03:41:10.010 --> 03:41:12.010]  a spirituality, it's almost a religion in a way
[03:41:12.010 --> 03:41:14.010]  in that everything that you do
[03:41:14.010 --> 03:41:16.010]  really, they're not
[03:41:16.010 --> 03:41:18.010]  fast processes, they take time
[03:41:18.010 --> 03:41:20.010]  so it gives you time to ground and really
[03:41:20.230 --> 03:41:22.230]  pay attention to what you're making
[03:41:22.230 --> 03:41:24.230]  for your plants
[03:41:24.230 --> 03:41:26.230]  with natural farming, there's no pesticides
[03:41:26.230 --> 03:41:28.230]  they don't include pesticides
[03:41:28.230 --> 03:41:30.230]  and there's a really good reason for that
[03:41:30.230 --> 03:41:32.230]  and the reason is that
[03:41:32.230 --> 03:41:34.230]  if you're doing natural farming
[03:41:34.230 --> 03:41:36.230]  so I just literally wrapped up
[03:41:36.230 --> 03:41:38.230]  an IMO 3 pile today
[03:41:38.230 --> 03:41:40.230]  which is indigenous microorganisms, you collect them
[03:41:40.230 --> 03:41:42.230]  from the woods, from undisturbed locations
[03:41:42.230 --> 03:41:44.230]  and you bring them in and you culture
[03:41:44.230 --> 03:41:46.230]  them out and then you inoculate your soil
[03:41:46.230 --> 03:41:48.230]  and if you're doing that, you're adding
[03:41:48.450 --> 03:41:50.450]  so much biodiversity that
[03:41:50.450 --> 03:41:52.450]  this comes back into that strength of the plant
[03:41:52.450 --> 03:41:54.450]  discussion and conversation
[03:41:54.450 --> 03:41:56.450]  so our full term plants
[03:41:56.450 --> 03:41:58.450]  we haven't
[03:41:58.450 --> 03:42:00.450]  fertilized, we haven't sprayed, we have not done
[03:42:00.450 --> 03:42:02.450]  a single thing to those plants other than
[03:42:02.450 --> 03:42:04.450]  when we put them in the ground, well they do get
[03:42:04.450 --> 03:42:06.450]  irrigation, but other than that
[03:42:06.450 --> 03:42:08.450]  that's all that we did for those plants
[03:42:08.450 --> 03:42:10.450]  we do have a couple aphids here and there
[03:42:10.450 --> 03:42:12.450]  but we do not have infestation at all
[03:42:12.450 --> 03:42:14.450]  and the reason is because
[03:42:14.450 --> 03:42:16.450]  those plants have such a strong
[03:42:16.670 --> 03:42:18.670]  biodiversity in the soil, the living soil
[03:42:18.670 --> 03:42:20.670]  is so robust
[03:42:20.670 --> 03:42:22.670]  that the plant is so incredibly strong
[03:42:22.670 --> 03:42:24.670]  that it just fends off any diseases
[03:42:24.670 --> 03:42:26.670]  so if you're doing natural
[03:42:26.670 --> 03:42:28.670]  farming correctly, you're in ground
[03:42:28.670 --> 03:42:30.670]  again this really can't be done in pots
[03:42:30.670 --> 03:42:32.670]  unless you're getting up above
[03:42:32.670 --> 03:42:34.670]  at least 65 gallons
[03:42:34.670 --> 03:42:36.670]  and that's kind of a smaller sized pot
[03:42:36.670 --> 03:42:38.670]  for natural farming
[03:42:38.670 --> 03:42:40.670]  but if you're in ground, you have a strong enough plant
[03:42:40.670 --> 03:42:42.670]  you don't need to worry about it
[03:42:42.670 --> 03:42:44.670]  Jadon is a different process
[03:42:44.890 --> 03:42:46.890]  it uses a lot more anaerobic processes
[03:42:46.890 --> 03:42:48.890]  so you're doing like Jadon liquid fertilizer
[03:42:48.890 --> 03:42:50.890]  which is, I call it, you throw shit
[03:42:50.890 --> 03:42:52.890]  in a bucket and let it putrefy
[03:42:52.890 --> 03:42:54.890]  it's, I can't
[03:42:54.890 --> 03:42:56.890]  it's, ugh, the smell is just gross
[03:42:56.890 --> 03:42:58.890]  so it's not my go-to at all
[03:42:58.890 --> 03:43:00.890]  but with those processes
[03:43:00.890 --> 03:43:02.890]  because you're not really
[03:43:02.890 --> 03:43:04.890]  inoculating with as much
[03:43:04.890 --> 03:43:06.890]  fungal diversity, which is what
[03:43:06.890 --> 03:43:08.890]  natural farming basis is, it's all about
[03:43:08.890 --> 03:43:10.890]  fungi in the soil, extremely
[03:43:10.890 --> 03:43:12.890]  diverse, many collections
[03:43:13.110 --> 03:43:15.110]  it takes years to really
[03:43:15.110 --> 03:43:17.110]  get it rolling properly
[03:43:17.110 --> 03:43:19.110]  Jadon is a lot faster
[03:43:19.110 --> 03:43:21.110]  you can start doing that tomorrow, you can have things going
[03:43:21.110 --> 03:43:23.110]  in a very short period of time, but
[03:43:23.110 --> 03:43:25.110]  your soil isn't as healthy
[03:43:25.110 --> 03:43:27.110]  I mean, I don't
[03:43:27.110 --> 03:43:29.110]  I shouldn't say that because I don't do Jadon so I don't know for certain
[03:43:29.110 --> 03:43:31.110]  I scope my soil, I scope my IMO
[03:43:31.110 --> 03:43:33.110]  I just, I'm trying to post on Instagram
[03:43:33.110 --> 03:43:35.110]  all of the fungal propagules that are
[03:43:35.110 --> 03:43:37.110]  all over this pile, I mean it's the best
[03:43:37.110 --> 03:43:39.110]  one I've ever had, and I know that's
[03:43:39.110 --> 03:43:41.110]  because my indigenous microorganism collections
[03:43:41.330 --> 03:43:43.330]  are getting better
[03:43:43.330 --> 03:43:45.330]  so with Jadon, maybe your soil is
[03:43:45.330 --> 03:43:47.330]  as good, but I feel like
[03:43:47.330 --> 03:43:49.330]  it doesn't tend to be quite
[03:43:49.330 --> 03:43:51.330]  so they do have pesticide
[03:43:51.330 --> 03:43:53.330]  applications for that
[03:43:53.330 --> 03:43:55.330]  and as you're transitioning over
[03:43:55.330 --> 03:43:57.330]  it's a lovely tool to have in your toolbox
[03:43:57.330 --> 03:43:59.330]  JWA is your Jadon
[03:43:59.330 --> 03:44:01.330]  wetting agent, that's used
[03:44:01.330 --> 03:44:03.330]  at a 1 to 100 to 1 to 50 ratio
[03:44:03.330 --> 03:44:05.330]  and it's basically a Castile soap
[03:44:05.330 --> 03:44:07.330]  but you make it yourself, it's dirt cheap
[03:44:07.330 --> 03:44:09.330]  literally cheaper than dirt
[03:44:09.550 --> 03:44:11.550]  I buy a lot
[03:44:11.550 --> 03:44:13.550]  and it's a great, it's basically a safer
[03:44:13.550 --> 03:44:15.550]  soap, it's a, what is safer soap?
[03:44:15.550 --> 03:44:17.550]  Fatty acid
[03:44:17.550 --> 03:44:19.550]  of potassium salt
[03:44:19.550 --> 03:44:21.550]  I think, so you're
[03:44:21.550 --> 03:44:23.550]  making that and it works
[03:44:23.550 --> 03:44:25.550]  wonderfully, it actually, we've had some
[03:44:25.550 --> 03:44:27.550]  great eradication of aphids
[03:44:27.550 --> 03:44:29.550]  using just Jadon wetting
[03:44:29.550 --> 03:44:31.550]  agent, at that 1 to 100
[03:44:31.550 --> 03:44:33.550]  to 1 to 500 ratio, or 1 to
[03:44:33.550 --> 03:44:35.550]  100 to 1 to 50 ratio
[03:44:35.550 --> 03:44:37.550]  and then if you want to keep
[03:44:37.770 --> 03:44:39.770]  going in that direction and really make a natural
[03:44:39.770 --> 03:44:41.770]  pesticide, that will
[03:44:41.770 --> 03:44:43.770]  Steve is saying that Jadon wetting agent
[03:44:43.770 --> 03:44:45.770]  will kill fish, so that's
[03:44:45.770 --> 03:44:47.770]  good to know
[03:44:47.770 --> 03:44:49.770]  I'm not aware of that
[03:44:49.770 --> 03:44:51.770]  but that would be something to pay attention to
[03:44:51.770 --> 03:44:53.770]  Yeah, it's yucca specifically
[03:44:53.770 --> 03:44:55.770]  What's that? It's yucca specifically
[03:44:55.770 --> 03:44:57.770]  native people, used to
[03:44:57.770 --> 03:44:59.770]  throw that in rivers and harvest fish that way
[03:44:59.770 --> 03:45:01.770]  Yeah, JWA doesn't use
[03:45:01.770 --> 03:45:03.770]  yucca, so
[03:45:03.770 --> 03:45:05.770]  There's a handful of plants that you can do that with
[03:45:05.990 --> 03:45:07.990]  Yeah
[03:45:07.990 --> 03:45:09.990]  Just the nature of soap will do that too. Wendy, while I've got you
[03:45:09.990 --> 03:45:11.990]  can you share with me and with the rest of us
[03:45:11.990 --> 03:45:13.990]  where we can find you? I don't know how to
[03:45:13.990 --> 03:45:15.990]  follow you or
[03:45:15.990 --> 03:45:17.990]  Oh, yeah, Sunnabis
[03:45:17.990 --> 03:45:19.990]  Hi
[03:45:19.990 --> 03:45:21.990]  I'm Sunnabis, S-U-N-N-A-B-I-S
[03:45:21.990 --> 03:45:23.990]  Sunnabis on Instagram
[03:45:23.990 --> 03:45:25.990]  I believe we're still under
[03:45:25.990 --> 03:45:27.990]  Humboldt's Full Sun Farms on
[03:45:27.990 --> 03:45:29.990]  Facebook
[03:45:29.990 --> 03:45:31.990]  I'm not the most technologically savvy
[03:45:31.990 --> 03:45:33.990]  so changing things over, I just leave it where it is
[03:45:34.210 --> 03:45:36.210]  It's fine
[03:45:36.210 --> 03:45:38.210]  Mostly on Instagram though is where I
[03:45:38.210 --> 03:45:40.210]  do a lot of my trials
[03:45:40.210 --> 03:45:42.210]  I do a lot of side by sides
[03:45:42.210 --> 03:45:44.210]  just things that kind of
[03:45:44.210 --> 03:45:46.210]  some things just kind of happen and other things
[03:45:46.210 --> 03:45:48.210]  I do on purpose. Most things I do on purpose
[03:45:48.210 --> 03:45:50.210]  Yeah, that's it
[03:45:50.210 --> 03:45:52.210]  So
[03:45:52.210 --> 03:45:54.210]  Yeah, so be aware with the
[03:45:54.210 --> 03:45:56.210]  wedding agent that you want to
[03:45:56.210 --> 03:45:58.210]  in my opinion, you want to stay away from
[03:45:58.210 --> 03:46:00.210]  waterways with all of this stuff
[03:46:00.210 --> 03:46:02.210]  It doesn't really matter what you're putting on
[03:46:02.430 --> 03:46:04.430]  Just be conscientious
[03:46:04.430 --> 03:46:06.430]  Again, another reason why I like natural farming
[03:46:06.430 --> 03:46:08.430]  because you don't need this stuff
[03:46:08.430 --> 03:46:10.430]  But it does take time to get there
[03:46:10.430 --> 03:46:12.430]  So then continue with
[03:46:12.430 --> 03:46:14.430]  Jadam natural pesticides. There's also
[03:46:14.430 --> 03:46:16.430]  a Jadam sulfur agent which you can make yourself
[03:46:16.430 --> 03:46:18.430]  People are really familiar
[03:46:18.430 --> 03:46:20.430]  with sulfur. It's not really that great
[03:46:20.430 --> 03:46:22.430]  for cannabis. The
[03:46:22.430 --> 03:46:24.430]  extractors really don't like it
[03:46:24.430 --> 03:46:26.430]  I personally don't love it but
[03:46:26.430 --> 03:46:28.430]  if you're hit with something like
[03:46:28.430 --> 03:46:30.430]  Resitmites and you feel
[03:46:30.650 --> 03:46:32.650]  like it's the only thing to go for
[03:46:32.650 --> 03:46:34.650]  then it is something that you can use
[03:46:34.650 --> 03:46:36.650]  We haven't found it to be necessary
[03:46:36.650 --> 03:46:38.650]  though, honestly. I have a quart of it
[03:46:38.650 --> 03:46:40.650]  that was given to me a year and a half ago and I still have it
[03:46:40.650 --> 03:46:42.650]  So I tried it on the
[03:46:42.650 --> 03:46:44.650]  aphids. It didn't seem to really... they didn't care
[03:46:44.650 --> 03:46:46.650]  They were like, whatever, here's sulfur
[03:46:46.650 --> 03:46:48.650]  makes us laugh. So after that
[03:46:48.650 --> 03:46:50.650]  I just... I'm just
[03:46:50.650 --> 03:46:52.650]  I'll get back to trialing some
[03:46:52.650 --> 03:46:54.650]  stuff out again maybe this winter when I have
[03:46:54.650 --> 03:46:56.650]  my dirty garden up and running
[03:46:56.650 --> 03:46:58.650]  and full of bugs
[03:46:58.870 --> 03:47:00.870]  I do that on purpose which I think is really fun
[03:47:00.870 --> 03:47:02.870]  And then the third
[03:47:02.870 --> 03:47:04.870]  key component
[03:47:04.870 --> 03:47:06.870]  of Jadam natural pesticide
[03:47:06.870 --> 03:47:08.870]  solution is called
[03:47:08.870 --> 03:47:10.870]  JHS, Jadam herbal solution
[03:47:10.870 --> 03:47:12.870]  and that's basically just
[03:47:12.870 --> 03:47:14.870]  boiling down certain herbs
[03:47:14.870 --> 03:47:16.870]  to make a
[03:47:16.870 --> 03:47:18.870]  you know, an extract if you will
[03:47:18.870 --> 03:47:20.870]  or... it's not really an extract
[03:47:20.870 --> 03:47:22.870]  it's a solution so I've played
[03:47:22.870 --> 03:47:24.870]  with that a bunch. We've done
[03:47:24.870 --> 03:47:26.870]  California Bay Laurel is something
[03:47:27.090 --> 03:47:29.090]  that is not one of the prescribed ones
[03:47:29.090 --> 03:47:31.090]  however we've had a lot of people
[03:47:31.090 --> 03:47:33.090]  trialing out
[03:47:33.090 --> 03:47:35.090]  The problem that we're having with the JHS
[03:47:35.090 --> 03:47:37.090]  across the natural farming community
[03:47:37.090 --> 03:47:39.090]  is that we seem to have
[03:47:39.090 --> 03:47:41.090]  it's really hit or miss
[03:47:41.090 --> 03:47:43.090]  Sometimes we're like, wow
[03:47:43.090 --> 03:47:45.090]  amazing eradication and then
[03:47:45.090 --> 03:47:47.090]  three months later it's not working at all
[03:47:47.090 --> 03:47:49.090]  So I can't quite figure out what's
[03:47:49.090 --> 03:47:51.090]  going on with that so Jerusalem Ardishok
[03:47:51.090 --> 03:47:53.090]  sometimes it works really well
[03:47:53.090 --> 03:47:55.090]  sometimes it doesn't seem to be working
[03:47:55.310 --> 03:47:57.310]  at all. And specifically we've been
[03:47:57.310 --> 03:47:59.310]  trialing and focusing on the Russet Mites
[03:47:59.310 --> 03:48:01.310]  and the Cannabis Aphids
[03:48:01.310 --> 03:48:03.310]  The other JHS
[03:48:03.310 --> 03:48:05.310]  we've been playing with is
[03:48:05.310 --> 03:48:07.310]  so the California Bay Laurel
[03:48:07.310 --> 03:48:09.310]  the Jerusalem Ardishok and then Ginkgo
[03:48:09.310 --> 03:48:11.310]  So
[03:48:11.310 --> 03:48:13.310]  those are kind of the Ginkgo and
[03:48:13.310 --> 03:48:15.310]  the Jerusalem Ardishok are the two
[03:48:15.310 --> 03:48:17.310]  that
[03:48:17.310 --> 03:48:19.310]  are prescribed in the Jadam book
[03:48:19.310 --> 03:48:21.310]  as being kind of like the most overall
[03:48:21.310 --> 03:48:23.310]  usage
[03:48:23.530 --> 03:48:25.530]  So there's another friend of ours
[03:48:25.530 --> 03:48:27.530]  Sam who's actually been playing
[03:48:27.530 --> 03:48:29.530]  with some other
[03:48:29.530 --> 03:48:31.530]  he's kind of going really off the books
[03:48:31.530 --> 03:48:33.530]  and he's got a Cedar one
[03:48:33.530 --> 03:48:35.530]  that he's finding to be pretty good
[03:48:35.530 --> 03:48:37.530]  but again we're not sure
[03:48:37.530 --> 03:48:39.530]  about efficacy over longevity
[03:48:39.530 --> 03:48:41.530]  it's just kind of like, huh
[03:48:41.530 --> 03:48:43.530]  seems to work and then it doesn't
[03:48:43.530 --> 03:48:45.530]  so I don't know. Ah, swimming pool
[03:48:45.530 --> 03:48:47.530]  Oh, I'm so jealous. It has been so hot
[03:48:47.530 --> 03:48:49.530]  up here
[03:48:49.530 --> 03:48:51.530]  With the Ginkgo, are you
[03:48:51.750 --> 03:48:53.750]  using the leaf, I imagine?
[03:48:53.750 --> 03:48:55.750]  Yeah
[03:48:55.750 --> 03:48:57.750]  I'm just using the leaves
[03:48:57.750 --> 03:48:59.750]  because that's what I have access to
[03:48:59.750 --> 03:49:01.750]  I've been using them
[03:49:01.750 --> 03:49:03.750]  when they're green but
[03:49:03.750 --> 03:49:05.750]  it's said that you can use them any time
[03:49:05.750 --> 03:49:07.750]  and the fruits are supposed to be
[03:49:07.750 --> 03:49:09.750]  more potent
[03:49:09.750 --> 03:49:11.750]  however the problem there is that nobody
[03:49:11.750 --> 03:49:13.750]  really wants to grow them for fruit because
[03:49:13.750 --> 03:49:15.750]  apparently it's really stinky and really messy
[03:49:15.750 --> 03:49:17.750]  so finding Ginkgo fruits is like impossible
[03:49:17.750 --> 03:49:19.750]  It's random
[03:49:19.970 --> 03:49:21.970]  I've got a study that you can use Ginkgo from seed
[03:49:21.970 --> 03:49:23.970]  to get fruits
[03:49:23.970 --> 03:49:25.970]  The reason I ask is I'm a trained herbalist
[03:49:25.970 --> 03:49:27.970]  and in herbalism you use
[03:49:27.970 --> 03:49:29.970]  the yellow leaf not the green leaf
[03:49:29.970 --> 03:49:31.970]  I was just curious
[03:49:31.970 --> 03:49:33.970]  because the yellow leaf
[03:49:33.970 --> 03:49:35.970]  has more
[03:49:35.970 --> 03:49:37.970]  of what you're looking for
[03:49:37.970 --> 03:49:39.970]  as people medicine not as plant medicine
[03:49:39.970 --> 03:49:41.970]  so I was just wondering
[03:49:41.970 --> 03:49:43.970]  what you use there, thanks
[03:49:43.970 --> 03:49:45.970]  Yeah, that's interesting
[03:49:45.970 --> 03:49:47.970]  I will, oh man, now I have another side by side
[03:49:48.190 --> 03:49:50.190]  I'm going to have to do
[03:49:50.190 --> 03:49:52.190]  I'll trial them out and see if the yellow does better
[03:49:52.190 --> 03:49:54.190]  because that's an important
[03:49:54.190 --> 03:49:56.190]  key note if it does
[03:49:56.190 --> 03:49:58.190]  I was curious too about the Jerusalem
[03:49:58.190 --> 03:50:00.190]  when you're noticing the efficacy differences
[03:50:00.190 --> 03:50:02.190]  are you using the same batch of Jerusalem
[03:50:02.190 --> 03:50:04.190]  or is it different from batch to batch
[03:50:04.190 --> 03:50:06.190]  or
[03:50:06.190 --> 03:50:08.190]  because I wonder if it has to do with
[03:50:08.190 --> 03:50:10.190]  the time of the harvest and the secondary metabolites
[03:50:10.190 --> 03:50:12.190]  within the Jerusalem themselves
[03:50:12.190 --> 03:50:14.190]  but if you're using the same batch and noticing
[03:50:14.190 --> 03:50:16.190]  efficacy change over time
[03:50:16.410 --> 03:50:18.410]  with that same batch of Jerusalem artichoke
[03:50:18.410 --> 03:50:20.410]  then that kind of cancels that all out
[03:50:22.410 --> 03:50:24.410]  Yeah, for me it's been different batches
[03:50:24.410 --> 03:50:26.410]  and I would have to check back in
[03:50:26.410 --> 03:50:28.410]  with the other people that are collecting data as well
[03:50:28.410 --> 03:50:30.410]  and find out and that's a great
[03:50:30.410 --> 03:50:32.410]  question too
[03:50:32.410 --> 03:50:34.410]  I do know that like the
[03:50:34.410 --> 03:50:36.410]  Bay Laurel was the same batch
[03:50:36.410 --> 03:50:38.410]  that I've used and
[03:50:38.410 --> 03:50:40.410]  at first I thought it did great and then
[03:50:40.410 --> 03:50:42.410]  because it did, it had an initial
[03:50:42.410 --> 03:50:44.410]  kill rate of about 60% on the
[03:50:44.630 --> 03:50:46.630]  cannabis aphids and so I was like this is
[03:50:46.630 --> 03:50:48.630]  wonderful, you know, if I'm getting this
[03:50:48.630 --> 03:50:50.630]  but then over the course of the next few
[03:50:50.630 --> 03:50:52.630]  weeks
[03:50:52.630 --> 03:50:54.630]  it's just, it stopped
[03:50:54.630 --> 03:50:56.630]  and then I was getting
[03:50:56.630 --> 03:50:58.630]  no more kill rate and then all of a sudden they were just
[03:50:58.630 --> 03:51:00.630]  gone but they weren't dead so I think
[03:51:00.630 --> 03:51:02.630]  it just created such a nondescript
[03:51:02.630 --> 03:51:04.630]  environment that they kind of
[03:51:04.630 --> 03:51:06.630]  fled the area
[03:51:06.630 --> 03:51:08.630]  is my suspicion on that trial
[03:51:08.630 --> 03:51:10.630]  and we've kind of heard some
[03:51:10.630 --> 03:51:12.630]  similar stuff from other
[03:51:12.850 --> 03:51:14.850]  people that have trialed it out as well
[03:51:14.850 --> 03:51:16.850]  I wonder if you were accidentally
[03:51:16.850 --> 03:51:18.850]  breeding for resistance with that then if you're
[03:51:18.850 --> 03:51:20.850]  only getting a 60% kill rate
[03:51:20.850 --> 03:51:22.850]  in the beginning, if that 40%
[03:51:22.850 --> 03:51:24.850]  said well we can
[03:51:24.850 --> 03:51:26.850]  handle that and then they breed so fast
[03:51:26.850 --> 03:51:28.850]  that eventually you apply and apply
[03:51:28.850 --> 03:51:30.850]  and apply like a traditional pesticide
[03:51:30.850 --> 03:51:32.850]  and you end up with a resistant bug
[03:51:32.850 --> 03:51:34.850]  so then you would have to switch to something else
[03:51:34.850 --> 03:51:36.850]  Yeah
[03:51:36.850 --> 03:51:38.850]  and I don't know for certain
[03:51:38.850 --> 03:51:40.850]  on that, I do
[03:51:41.070 --> 03:51:43.070]  I know that the aphids, so like I said
[03:51:43.070 --> 03:51:45.070]  I literally have what I call my dirty
[03:51:45.070 --> 03:51:47.070]  garden and I
[03:51:47.070 --> 03:51:49.070]  infested on purpose, I've got some russets
[03:51:49.070 --> 03:51:51.070]  going right now so I'm super excited because I didn't
[03:51:51.070 --> 03:51:53.070]  have any this year
[03:51:53.070 --> 03:51:55.070]  I'm the excited person
[03:51:55.070 --> 03:51:57.070]  I'm excited I have russets
[03:51:57.070 --> 03:51:59.070]  yay
[03:51:59.070 --> 03:52:01.070]  so but with the dirty garden
[03:52:01.070 --> 03:52:03.070]  those cannabis aphids
[03:52:03.070 --> 03:52:05.070]  I know, broad mites
[03:52:05.070 --> 03:52:07.070]  if anybody has broad mites send me
[03:52:07.070 --> 03:52:09.070]  your broad mites, oh my gosh
[03:52:09.290 --> 03:52:11.290]  I'll find them anywhere
[03:52:11.290 --> 03:52:13.290]  sorry
[03:52:13.290 --> 03:52:15.290]  so yeah so those
[03:52:15.290 --> 03:52:17.290]  the aphids though, they actually
[03:52:17.290 --> 03:52:19.290]  they left the entire garden
[03:52:19.290 --> 03:52:21.290]  they were just, you know
[03:52:21.290 --> 03:52:23.290]  I know I did not get a 100% kill
[03:52:23.290 --> 03:52:25.290]  because they were alive and they were there
[03:52:25.290 --> 03:52:27.290]  and I'm like ah I don't feel like they're dying
[03:52:27.290 --> 03:52:29.290]  anymore and then I looked like three days later
[03:52:29.290 --> 03:52:31.290]  and they were just literally gone
[03:52:31.290 --> 03:52:33.290]  so I'm not sure what
[03:52:33.290 --> 03:52:35.290]  exactly happened
[03:52:35.290 --> 03:52:37.290]  and I haven't reinfested
[03:52:37.510 --> 03:52:39.510]  since then so
[03:52:39.510 --> 03:52:41.510]  they may have gotten resistance or they may have
[03:52:41.510 --> 03:52:43.510]  left or they may have actually died or
[03:52:43.510 --> 03:52:45.510]  I don't know maybe I had a natural predator come in
[03:52:45.510 --> 03:52:47.510]  and mop up and finish them up without me knowing it
[03:52:47.510 --> 03:52:49.510]  you're just an assassin
[03:52:51.510 --> 03:52:53.510]  gotta know what works right
[03:52:53.510 --> 03:52:55.510]  and if it doesn't work that's even more important
[03:52:55.510 --> 03:52:57.510]  I don't want to have people out there being like
[03:52:57.510 --> 03:52:59.510]  well thanks that just ruined my
[03:52:59.510 --> 03:53:01.510]  year so
[03:53:01.510 --> 03:53:09.070]  well you know
[03:53:09.070 --> 03:53:11.070]  it's awesome to see
[03:53:11.290 --> 03:53:13.290]  perfect Northwest roots joining in the house
[03:53:13.290 --> 03:53:15.290]  it's perfect time to say hello to this guy
[03:53:15.290 --> 03:53:17.290]  he hasn't been introduced yet and also
[03:53:17.290 --> 03:53:19.290]  blue green tank I actually have not
[03:53:19.290 --> 03:53:21.290]  met you before I don't know who you are
[03:53:21.290 --> 03:53:23.290]  sorry
[03:53:23.290 --> 03:53:25.290]  blue's awesome
[03:53:25.290 --> 03:53:27.290]  I'll let him talk
[03:53:27.290 --> 03:53:31.650]  ah there we go
[03:53:31.650 --> 03:53:33.650]  I got him muted
[03:53:33.650 --> 03:53:35.650]  hey Tara, yeah what's up everybody
[03:53:35.650 --> 03:53:37.650]  Mr. Avocado
[03:53:37.650 --> 03:53:39.650]  Tech in the building
[03:53:39.870 --> 03:53:41.870]  that's my
[03:53:41.870 --> 03:53:43.870]  I guess my key to the city here
[03:53:43.870 --> 03:53:45.870]  is just a unique
[03:53:45.870 --> 03:53:47.870]  method of cultivation using avocados
[03:53:47.870 --> 03:53:49.870]  and peace to my brother
[03:53:49.870 --> 03:53:51.870]  Kaya, he knows what time it is
[03:53:51.870 --> 03:53:53.870]  Cascadian everybody
[03:53:53.870 --> 03:53:55.870]  just want to say what up
[03:53:55.870 --> 03:53:57.870]  Spartan is good
[03:53:57.870 --> 03:53:59.870]  making that stock-a-mole
[03:53:59.870 --> 03:54:01.870]  yeah that super guac
[03:54:01.870 --> 03:54:03.870]  yeah no that's
[03:54:03.870 --> 03:54:05.870]  I love the conversation you guys were having about
[03:54:05.870 --> 03:54:07.870]  stressors and driving aspects
[03:54:08.090 --> 03:54:10.090]  of the plant and that's completely what I'm into
[03:54:10.090 --> 03:54:12.090]  right now I'm trying to
[03:54:12.090 --> 03:54:14.090]  use a simple method of feeding
[03:54:14.090 --> 03:54:16.090]  just to take care of my soil
[03:54:16.090 --> 03:54:18.090]  and while doing that I can focus my time
[03:54:18.090 --> 03:54:20.090]  on the canopy
[03:54:20.090 --> 03:54:22.090]  and stressors and training
[03:54:22.090 --> 03:54:24.090]  and ways to manipulate the plant
[03:54:24.090 --> 03:54:26.090]  and yeah the avocado
[03:54:26.090 --> 03:54:28.090]  I blend amendments into it
[03:54:28.090 --> 03:54:30.090]  and I put it on the soil surface
[03:54:30.090 --> 03:54:32.090]  and all the worms in my system
[03:54:32.090 --> 03:54:34.090]  just go nuts for it and essentially
[03:54:34.090 --> 03:54:36.090]  assimilate all that goodness down into the soil
[03:54:36.310 --> 03:54:38.310]  so that's pretty much my method of cultivation
[03:54:38.310 --> 03:54:40.310]  and I'm trying it out
[03:54:40.310 --> 03:54:42.310]  and testing it out everywhere I can, indoor, outdoor
[03:54:42.310 --> 03:54:44.310]  and in between
[03:54:44.310 --> 03:54:46.310]  I was going to say
[03:54:46.310 --> 03:54:48.310]  Blue I don't know if you were on
[03:54:48.310 --> 03:54:50.310]  earlier when Steve was talking
[03:54:50.310 --> 03:54:52.310]  about doing some of this basically
[03:54:52.310 --> 03:54:54.310]  kind of the same stuff
[03:54:54.310 --> 03:54:56.310]  and I really chuckled at it
[03:54:56.310 --> 03:54:58.310]  no I was not
[03:54:58.310 --> 03:55:00.310]  I was out to dinner with the family and everything
[03:55:00.310 --> 03:55:02.310]  so I'm coming in a little late
[03:55:02.310 --> 03:55:04.310]  but yeah
[03:55:04.530 --> 03:55:06.530]  it's a magical concert to see when you put that
[03:55:06.530 --> 03:55:08.530]  thing down and especially when I
[03:55:08.530 --> 03:55:10.530]  manipulate it and steer it by adding
[03:55:10.530 --> 03:55:12.530]  things like I use a lot of pureed
[03:55:12.530 --> 03:55:14.530]  dried fruits because they're high in potassium
[03:55:14.530 --> 03:55:16.530]  so in flowering or
[03:55:16.530 --> 03:55:18.530]  early to mid flower
[03:55:18.530 --> 03:55:20.530]  I'll put down something ahead of time that's loaded
[03:55:20.530 --> 03:55:22.530]  with a specific thing
[03:55:22.530 --> 03:55:24.530]  like metajoule dates
[03:55:24.530 --> 03:55:26.530]  or figs
[03:55:26.530 --> 03:55:28.530]  or something like that
[03:55:28.530 --> 03:55:30.530]  and I see the different way that pod gets
[03:55:30.530 --> 03:55:32.530]  broken down and also translates into the
[03:55:32.750 --> 03:55:34.750]  final product so it's super cool
[03:55:34.750 --> 03:55:36.750]  I gotta point this out to Terrence
[03:55:36.750 --> 03:55:38.750]  you can see behind me
[03:55:38.750 --> 03:55:40.750]  see the red kale
[03:55:40.750 --> 03:55:42.750]  and the plant
[03:55:42.750 --> 03:55:44.750]  I just always put that red kale
[03:55:44.750 --> 03:55:46.750]  with them because if there's any
[03:55:46.750 --> 03:55:48.750]  aphids they always
[03:55:48.750 --> 03:55:50.750]  go to the red kale
[03:55:50.750 --> 03:55:52.750]  they just love it they take it
[03:55:52.750 --> 03:55:54.750]  anytime over any pot
[03:55:54.750 --> 03:55:56.750]  so I can always see my outdoors
[03:55:56.750 --> 03:55:58.750]  that I'll have red kale around
[03:55:58.750 --> 03:56:00.750]  them
[03:56:00.970 --> 03:56:02.970]  I just want to give a
[03:56:02.970 --> 03:56:04.970]  honorable mention real quick to the
[03:56:04.970 --> 03:56:06.970]  explosive ember pepper
[03:56:06.970 --> 03:56:08.970]  I don't know if you're aware Steve
[03:56:08.970 --> 03:56:10.970]  that's another really nice banker plant
[03:56:10.970 --> 03:56:12.970]  but on
[03:56:12.970 --> 03:56:14.970]  for it's purposes it's a
[03:56:14.970 --> 03:56:16.970]  pollen and nectar source for
[03:56:16.970 --> 03:56:18.970]  predatory mites
[03:56:18.970 --> 03:56:20.970]  I have some of those
[03:56:20.970 --> 03:56:22.970]  too because I've got somebody at the farm
[03:56:22.970 --> 03:56:24.970]  who's more specialized in this
[03:56:24.970 --> 03:56:26.970]  than me and I know
[03:56:26.970 --> 03:56:28.970]  they've got banker plants there that are
[03:56:29.190 --> 03:56:31.190]  to attract predators
[03:56:31.190 --> 03:56:33.190]  that they
[03:56:33.190 --> 03:56:35.190]  they're flowers and stuff
[03:56:35.190 --> 03:56:37.190]  I don't know the names of the flowers
[03:56:37.190 --> 03:56:39.190]  that I haven't seen before
[03:56:39.190 --> 03:56:41.190]  the explosive ember pepper
[03:56:41.190 --> 03:56:43.190]  in particular has shown both in the field
[03:56:43.190 --> 03:56:45.190]  and in
[03:56:45.190 --> 03:56:47.190]  white papers research papers to be
[03:56:47.190 --> 03:56:49.190]  one of the more effective plants for
[03:56:49.190 --> 03:56:51.190]  hosting the predatory mites
[03:56:51.190 --> 03:56:53.190]  so I just wanted to make sure
[03:56:53.190 --> 03:56:55.190]  it got an honorable mention
[03:56:55.190 --> 03:56:57.190]  I was going to say Steve
[03:56:57.410 --> 03:56:59.410]  Steve I want to ask you real quick about
[03:56:59.410 --> 03:57:01.410]  whether you think that's going to hold
[03:57:01.410 --> 03:57:03.410]  true for the cannabis aphids as well
[03:57:03.410 --> 03:57:05.410]  because normal aphids
[03:57:05.410 --> 03:57:07.410]  the ones I've had anyways
[03:57:07.410 --> 03:57:09.410]  I'm wondering because
[03:57:09.410 --> 03:57:11.410]  you're an entomologist
[03:57:11.410 --> 03:57:13.410]  I'm not maybe
[03:57:13.410 --> 03:57:15.410]  I don't know which aphids they were
[03:57:15.410 --> 03:57:17.410]  I don't know which aphids they were exactly
[03:57:17.410 --> 03:57:19.410]  I just know that there was
[03:57:19.410 --> 03:57:21.410]  a swarm of them
[03:57:21.410 --> 03:57:23.410]  on the red kale
[03:57:23.410 --> 03:57:25.410]  over other types of kale
[03:57:25.630 --> 03:57:27.630]  other types of plants
[03:57:27.630 --> 03:57:29.630]  but once those kale were done
[03:57:29.630 --> 03:57:31.630]  some of them moved to cannabis
[03:57:31.630 --> 03:57:33.630]  but not many because
[03:57:33.630 --> 03:57:35.630]  once they hit a critical mass
[03:57:35.630 --> 03:57:37.630]  of aphids on the kale
[03:57:37.630 --> 03:57:39.630]  then it made an explosion
[03:57:39.630 --> 03:57:41.630]  in predators coming to eat
[03:57:41.630 --> 03:57:43.630]  the aphids
[03:57:43.630 --> 03:57:45.630]  so it was neat to watch but I never
[03:57:45.630 --> 03:57:47.630]  really had an infestation on the
[03:57:47.630 --> 03:57:49.630]  pot plants and I had four
[03:57:49.630 --> 03:57:51.630]  monsters around here
[03:57:51.630 --> 03:57:53.630]  that are monsters and they were
[03:57:53.850 --> 03:57:55.850]  two kilos each basically
[03:57:55.850 --> 03:57:57.850]  and they were seven to nine feet
[03:57:57.850 --> 03:57:59.850]  tall, big enough for
[03:57:59.850 --> 03:58:01.850]  stakes and wires holding them up
[03:58:01.850 --> 03:58:03.850]  but there really wasn't
[03:58:03.850 --> 03:58:05.850]  any stress of
[03:58:05.850 --> 03:58:07.850]  bugs on them like they never
[03:58:07.850 --> 03:58:09.850]  started spraying anything on them
[03:58:09.850 --> 03:58:11.850]  at any point but the
[03:58:11.850 --> 03:58:13.850]  banker plants were just swarming with them
[03:58:13.850 --> 03:58:15.850]  beside them you know but I don't know
[03:58:15.850 --> 03:58:17.850]  if they were a different type of aphid that would
[03:58:17.850 --> 03:58:19.850]  explain it too
[03:58:19.850 --> 03:58:21.850]  yeah I think that I've
[03:58:22.070 --> 03:58:24.070]  heard that the entomologists believe
[03:58:24.070 --> 03:58:26.070]  that possibly the cannabis
[03:58:26.070 --> 03:58:28.070]  aphids may move between cannabis
[03:58:28.070 --> 03:58:30.070]  and hops but not necessarily
[03:58:30.070 --> 03:58:32.070]  onto any other plants
[03:58:32.070 --> 03:58:34.070]  but I'm not
[03:58:34.070 --> 03:58:36.070]  entirely sure whether
[03:58:36.070 --> 03:58:38.070]  that's been confirmed or not
[03:58:38.070 --> 03:58:40.070]  I know my kale definitely gets all the
[03:58:40.070 --> 03:58:42.070]  aphids, all the aphids
[03:58:42.070 --> 03:58:44.070]  on my kale
[03:58:44.070 --> 03:58:46.070]  they're nice in the spring
[03:58:46.070 --> 03:58:48.070]  it does get in the spring in the cool weather
[03:58:48.070 --> 03:58:50.070]  but once it gets
[03:58:50.290 --> 03:58:52.290]  really hot then they're just on it
[03:58:52.290 --> 03:58:54.290]  because there's so much juice in them to suck out
[03:58:54.290 --> 03:58:56.290]  I think too, like the moisture is really high
[03:58:56.290 --> 03:58:58.290]  in them right
[03:58:58.290 --> 03:59:00.290]  interesting, I don't know
[03:59:00.290 --> 03:59:02.290]  I just know what seems to be working
[03:59:02.290 --> 03:59:04.290]  whether it's really what's working I don't know
[03:59:04.290 --> 03:59:06.290]  it's working
[03:59:06.290 --> 03:59:08.290]  for you so it's working
[03:59:08.290 --> 03:59:10.290]  as long as it seems to be working sometimes that's good enough
[03:59:10.290 --> 03:59:12.290]  right
[03:59:12.290 --> 03:59:14.290]  I'd like to get
[03:59:14.290 --> 03:59:16.290]  I don't know if he's got, Steve
[03:59:16.290 --> 03:59:18.290]  Potent Ponic Steve if you could
[03:59:18.510 --> 03:59:20.510]  tell us about your IMO
[03:59:20.510 --> 03:59:22.510]  that you did out in Africa, I love hearing this story
[03:59:22.510 --> 03:59:24.510]  if you want to tell us that, how you used it with a
[03:59:24.510 --> 03:59:26.510]  pesticide twist
[03:59:26.510 --> 03:59:28.510]  hey there everybody
[03:59:28.510 --> 03:59:30.510]  thanks for having me
[03:59:30.510 --> 03:59:32.510]  sorry about that, it took me a minute to get home
[03:59:34.510 --> 03:59:36.510]  so yeah I just came back from Zimbabwe
[03:59:36.510 --> 03:59:38.510]  in April and
[03:59:38.510 --> 03:59:40.510]  we had issues with, in Zimbabwe
[03:59:40.510 --> 03:59:42.510]  it's really hard to get anything
[03:59:42.510 --> 03:59:44.510]  shipped there and if it is it's usually $500
[03:59:44.510 --> 03:59:46.510]  or more for the shipping
[03:59:46.730 --> 03:59:48.730]  and while I can get
[03:59:48.730 --> 03:59:50.730]  pretty good access to beneficial insects from
[03:59:50.730 --> 03:59:52.730]  South Africa, I have to pay a runner
[03:59:52.730 --> 03:59:54.730]  to drive down to the border and pick it up
[03:59:54.730 --> 03:59:56.730]  and then drive it up there if I actually
[03:59:56.730 --> 03:59:58.730]  want to make sure that it gets delivered without
[03:59:58.730 --> 04:00:00.730]  them dying, which is fine but
[04:00:00.730 --> 04:00:02.730]  that's not always an option 100% of the
[04:00:02.730 --> 04:00:04.730]  time, especially with the way the checkpoints
[04:00:04.730 --> 04:00:06.730]  are set up there, so we had to
[04:00:06.730 --> 04:00:08.730]  come up with a way to
[04:00:08.730 --> 04:00:10.730]  deal with, we have a lot of
[04:00:10.730 --> 04:00:12.730]  grasshoppers and a lot of
[04:00:12.730 --> 04:00:14.730]  stuff that doesn't really feed heavily on
[04:00:14.950 --> 04:00:16.950]  but maybe comes in off of the brush
[04:00:16.950 --> 04:00:18.950]  takes a couple bites and then moves on
[04:00:18.950 --> 04:00:20.950]  which anyone knows can be a great way
[04:00:20.950 --> 04:00:22.950]  to introduce a whole lot of different
[04:00:22.950 --> 04:00:24.950]  vector, a whole wide range of issues into
[04:00:24.950 --> 04:00:26.950]  your grow, so what we ended up
[04:00:26.950 --> 04:00:28.950]  finding was the best solution
[04:00:28.950 --> 04:00:30.950]  and this was actually per the advice of
[04:00:30.950 --> 04:00:32.950]  Chris Trump who
[04:00:32.950 --> 04:00:34.950]  had given me a tip
[04:00:34.950 --> 04:00:36.950]  on a couple of different things
[04:00:36.950 --> 04:00:38.950]  so we tried three different things, we tried
[04:00:38.950 --> 04:00:40.950]  adding insect
[04:00:40.950 --> 04:00:42.950]  frass at the point of IMO1
[04:00:43.170 --> 04:00:45.170]  collection where we
[04:00:45.170 --> 04:00:47.170]  add a 30% insect
[04:00:47.170 --> 04:00:49.170]  frass to 70%
[04:00:49.170 --> 04:00:51.170]  rice and then mixing
[04:00:51.170 --> 04:00:53.170]  that all together and then cooking
[04:00:53.170 --> 04:00:55.170]  that all together and kind of infusing the rice
[04:00:55.170 --> 04:00:57.170]  with the insect frass
[04:00:57.170 --> 04:00:59.170]  and all the goodness from that
[04:00:59.170 --> 04:01:01.170]  and then taking
[04:01:03.170 --> 04:01:05.170]  that and then turning it into IMO2
[04:01:05.170 --> 04:01:07.170]  and then to liquid IMO
[04:01:07.170 --> 04:01:09.170]  we also took that same process
[04:01:09.170 --> 04:01:11.170]  turned it into IMO3
[04:01:11.390 --> 04:01:13.390]  we didn't have time
[04:01:13.390 --> 04:01:15.390]  IMO4 when you're
[04:01:15.390 --> 04:01:17.390]  in Africa is not necessarily
[04:01:17.390 --> 04:01:19.390]  your cow manure and all the other stuff
[04:01:19.390 --> 04:01:21.390]  is not, you don't really know if it's
[04:01:21.390 --> 04:01:23.390]  nematode free and everything else
[04:01:23.390 --> 04:01:25.390]  so we just kind of stayed away from some
[04:01:25.390 --> 04:01:27.390]  of the stuff that we do over here for safety reasons
[04:01:27.390 --> 04:01:29.390]  but then
[04:01:29.390 --> 04:01:31.390]  the next one we tried was doing
[04:01:31.390 --> 04:01:33.390]  an IMO1 collection and then
[04:01:33.390 --> 04:01:35.390]  adding the insect frass at the point
[04:01:35.390 --> 04:01:37.390]  of IMO3
[04:01:37.390 --> 04:01:39.390]  and then turning that into liquid IMO
[04:01:39.610 --> 04:01:41.610]  and then the other one we did
[04:01:41.610 --> 04:01:43.610]  was doing a liquid IMO
[04:01:43.610 --> 04:01:45.610]  where we did the
[04:01:45.610 --> 04:01:47.610]  added the insect frass at the point of
[04:01:47.610 --> 04:01:49.610]  IMO2 and then
[04:01:49.610 --> 04:01:51.610]  stabilizing that for
[04:01:51.610 --> 04:01:53.610]  7 days and then spraying that
[04:01:53.610 --> 04:01:55.610]  at that point. The best
[04:01:55.610 --> 04:01:57.610]  solution was doing it
[04:01:57.610 --> 04:01:59.610]  at the 30% mixed
[04:01:59.610 --> 04:02:01.610]  with the rice during IMO1 collection
[04:02:01.610 --> 04:02:03.610]  so we were taking
[04:02:03.610 --> 04:02:05.610]  30% of our weight
[04:02:05.610 --> 04:02:07.610]  of our IMO as insect
[04:02:07.830 --> 04:02:09.830]  frass, 70% as rice so if we had
[04:02:09.830 --> 04:02:11.830]  a kilogram we would ray
[04:02:11.830 --> 04:02:13.830]  700 grams as rice
[04:02:13.830 --> 04:02:15.830]  300 grams as insect frass
[04:02:15.830 --> 04:02:17.830]  to get our kilogram
[04:02:17.830 --> 04:02:19.830]  and then we would take that, cook it down
[04:02:19.830 --> 04:02:21.830]  the same way we would with our rice
[04:02:21.830 --> 04:02:23.830]  it's not the most pleasant smelling thing
[04:02:23.830 --> 04:02:25.830]  but it works awesome
[04:02:25.830 --> 04:02:27.830]  and then we took that, put it out there and collected
[04:02:27.830 --> 04:02:29.830]  those insect and
[04:02:29.830 --> 04:02:31.830]  chitin feeding microbes and chitinase
[04:02:31.830 --> 04:02:33.830]  feeding microbes and
[04:02:33.830 --> 04:02:35.830]  brought them in and turned them into liquid
[04:02:36.050 --> 04:02:38.050]  and then sprayed them out there
[04:02:38.050 --> 04:02:40.050]  and holy crap did that not make a night and day difference
[04:02:40.050 --> 04:02:42.050]  after about day 5 or 6
[04:02:42.050 --> 04:02:44.050]  it takes a while for them to get
[04:02:44.050 --> 04:02:46.050]  infected and for it to kill them
[04:02:46.050 --> 04:02:48.050]  but certainly by day 5
[04:02:48.050 --> 04:02:50.050]  to 7 we were regularly
[04:02:50.050 --> 04:02:52.050]  finding dead grasshoppers in the
[04:02:52.050 --> 04:02:54.050]  fields without too much of an
[04:02:54.050 --> 04:02:56.050]  issue. It was a lot of
[04:02:56.050 --> 04:02:58.050]  cool learning experience
[04:02:58.050 --> 04:03:00.050]  especially being able to do a bunch of different sets side by
[04:03:00.050 --> 04:03:02.050]  side. I had to leave because of
[04:03:02.050 --> 04:03:04.050]  the virus. I had to basically decide if I was
[04:03:04.270 --> 04:03:06.270]  going to ride out the virus in Zimbabwe
[04:03:06.270 --> 04:03:08.270]  or come back to the west
[04:03:08.270 --> 04:03:10.270]  and I'm glad I came back
[04:03:10.270 --> 04:03:12.270]  to the west, I'll put it that way.
[04:03:12.270 --> 04:03:14.270]  Were you actually seeing
[04:03:14.270 --> 04:03:16.270]  detriment to these guys
[04:03:16.270 --> 04:03:18.270]  from the chitinase?
[04:03:18.270 --> 04:03:20.270]  Was it physically apparent?
[04:03:20.270 --> 04:03:22.270]  No, just finding them dead.
[04:03:22.270 --> 04:03:24.270]  Gotcha.
[04:03:24.270 --> 04:03:26.270]  But noticeable difference
[04:03:26.270 --> 04:03:28.270]  in how much we were
[04:03:28.270 --> 04:03:30.270]  getting, especially the chewing on the
[04:03:30.270 --> 04:03:32.270]  stems, right? So a lot of people
[04:03:32.490 --> 04:03:34.490]  haven't had the
[04:03:34.490 --> 04:03:36.490]  locusts and stuff that will chew the bark
[04:03:36.490 --> 04:03:38.490]  right off the whole center of the plant
[04:03:38.490 --> 04:03:40.490]  and they're not even going after the leaves, they're trying to eat the bark off
[04:03:40.490 --> 04:03:42.490]  and that completely screws anything
[04:03:42.490 --> 04:03:44.490]  above that on the plant and just basically
[04:03:44.490 --> 04:03:46.490]  rots or falls off or can be a vector
[04:03:46.490 --> 04:03:48.490]  for a whole wide range of other stuff.
[04:03:48.490 --> 04:03:50.490]  So it was
[04:03:50.490 --> 04:03:52.490]  quite the problem and it was honestly the
[04:03:52.490 --> 04:03:54.490]  only cost effective way that we were actually
[04:03:54.490 --> 04:03:56.490]  able to treat acres
[04:03:56.490 --> 04:03:58.490]  without being in the middle of nowhere
[04:03:58.490 --> 04:04:00.490]  in Zimbabwe and not having to rely on
[04:04:00.710 --> 04:04:02.710]  the regular importation of
[04:04:02.710 --> 04:04:04.710]  X, Y, and Z
[04:04:04.710 --> 04:04:06.710]  control agent.
[04:04:06.710 --> 04:04:08.710]  Steve, were you
[04:04:08.710 --> 04:04:10.710]  specifically collecting
[04:04:10.710 --> 04:04:12.710]  grasshoppers to
[04:04:12.710 --> 04:04:14.710]  treat grasshoppers or were you
[04:04:14.710 --> 04:04:16.710]  using any insect frass that you got a hold of
[04:04:16.710 --> 04:04:18.710]  or were you going after your
[04:04:18.710 --> 04:04:20.710]  target insect, so to say?
[04:04:20.710 --> 04:04:22.710]  I'm glad you asked that.
[04:04:22.710 --> 04:04:24.710]  We purchased insect frass
[04:04:24.710 --> 04:04:26.710]  but we also collected some insects
[04:04:26.710 --> 04:04:28.710]  from the property, again, for that specific
[04:04:28.930 --> 04:04:30.930]  purpose, the same way that you would collect IMO
[04:04:30.930 --> 04:04:32.930]  from underneath
[04:04:32.930 --> 04:04:34.930]  a log or a tree. Again, the whole
[04:04:34.930 --> 04:04:36.930]  point of that is to collect
[04:04:36.930 --> 04:04:38.930]  those microbes that will
[04:04:38.930 --> 04:04:40.930]  feed on the
[04:04:40.930 --> 04:04:42.930]  insects and screw with the insects.
[04:04:42.930 --> 04:04:44.930]  It might even be as simple as
[04:04:44.930 --> 04:04:46.930]  I don't know if you guys have noticed or watched
[04:04:46.930 --> 04:04:48.930]  some of the info that a gentleman named Zenfanol
[04:04:48.930 --> 04:04:50.930]  has put some pretty cool videos out on
[04:04:50.930 --> 04:04:52.930]  the, I believe it was someone else
[04:04:52.930 --> 04:04:54.930]  put out info on the
[04:04:54.930 --> 04:04:56.930]  root aphids and how the nematodes
[04:04:57.150 --> 04:04:59.150]  with the presence of Bavaria bisonia
[04:04:59.150 --> 04:05:01.150]  can be attacked by the nematodes but when
[04:05:01.150 --> 04:05:03.150]  the Bavaria bisonia isn't there
[04:05:03.150 --> 04:05:05.150]  it seems to not really attack them.
[04:05:05.150 --> 04:05:07.150]  Sometimes even introducing something that even just
[04:05:07.150 --> 04:05:09.150]  annoys them or doesn't kill them outright
[04:05:09.150 --> 04:05:11.150]  but can kind of otherwise
[04:05:11.150 --> 04:05:13.150]  distract them or keep them busy
[04:05:13.150 --> 04:05:15.150]  or otherwise compromise them
[04:05:15.150 --> 04:05:17.150]  in some way can actually allow another pathogen
[04:05:17.150 --> 04:05:19.150]  to come in and kill them much more efficiently.
[04:05:19.150 --> 04:05:21.150]  This is something that
[04:05:21.150 --> 04:05:23.150]  isn't expensive and you can make this
[04:05:23.150 --> 04:05:25.150]  anywhere in the world.
[04:05:25.370 --> 04:05:27.370]  It's a very effective pest control agent that we were using
[04:05:27.370 --> 04:05:29.370]  and they're still using now
[04:05:29.370 --> 04:05:31.370]  in Zimbabwe at that farm.
[04:05:31.370 --> 04:05:33.370]  What did the
[04:05:33.370 --> 04:05:35.370]  70-30 ratio come from?
[04:05:35.370 --> 04:05:37.370]  Did you try any others or has there been
[04:05:37.370 --> 04:05:39.370]  any others tried that you know of?
[04:05:39.370 --> 04:05:41.370]  We tried 50-50 and then we
[04:05:41.370 --> 04:05:43.370]  tried like a 25-75
[04:05:43.370 --> 04:05:45.370]  and the 25-75 was the one that
[04:05:45.370 --> 04:05:47.370]  worked. We tried
[04:05:47.370 --> 04:05:49.370]  30-70, 25-75
[04:05:49.370 --> 04:05:51.370]  whatever, 6 1 half dozen
[04:05:51.370 --> 04:05:53.370]  on the other is probably the difference but
[04:05:53.590 --> 04:05:55.590]  someone definitely could probably take that
[04:05:55.590 --> 04:05:57.590]  and extrapolate it and fine tune it a little more.
[04:05:57.590 --> 04:05:59.590]  I think it's mostly just going to be
[04:05:59.590 --> 04:06:01.590]  making sure you have enough to have
[04:06:01.590 --> 04:06:03.590]  a base that's going to allow a place for
[04:06:03.590 --> 04:06:05.590]  those microbes to migrate and colonize.
[04:06:05.590 --> 04:06:07.590]  You're just trying to basically have something
[04:06:07.590 --> 04:06:09.590]  that's kind of replicating an insect corpse
[04:06:09.590 --> 04:06:11.590]  that can then attract
[04:06:11.590 --> 04:06:13.590]  it and then the extra rice
[04:06:13.590 --> 04:06:15.590]  as well as the carbon sources
[04:06:15.590 --> 04:06:17.590]  there to help keep them going or
[04:06:17.590 --> 04:06:19.590]  propagate them further but it's such a
[04:06:19.590 --> 04:06:21.590]  great resource
[04:06:21.810 --> 04:06:23.810]  and I think it's a great
[04:06:23.810 --> 04:06:25.810]  resource as far as something that
[04:06:25.810 --> 04:06:27.810]  anybody can make as far as a cheap
[04:06:27.810 --> 04:06:29.810]  quick and easy pest control agent.
[04:06:29.810 --> 04:06:34.170]  So Steve,
[04:06:34.170 --> 04:06:36.170]  do you think that you were
[04:06:36.170 --> 04:06:38.170]  achieving like more of a
[04:06:38.170 --> 04:06:40.170]  distracting or masking the plants
[04:06:40.170 --> 04:06:42.170]  or do you think that you were
[04:06:42.170 --> 04:06:44.170]  eliciting like an immune response
[04:06:44.170 --> 04:06:46.170]  that would kind of stifle the
[04:06:46.170 --> 04:06:48.170]  pests? Which one do you think it was?
[04:06:48.170 --> 04:06:50.170]  I have no idea.
[04:06:50.170 --> 04:06:52.170]  If I had to guess,
[04:06:52.390 --> 04:06:54.390]  again, I didn't have enough time to do a lot
[04:06:54.390 --> 04:06:56.390]  of extensive microbial work or anything like that.
[04:06:56.390 --> 04:06:58.390]  I would say if I had to guess,
[04:06:58.390 --> 04:07:00.390]  making an educated guess,
[04:07:00.390 --> 04:07:02.390]  I would say that it's probably introducing
[04:07:02.390 --> 04:07:04.390]  microbes that are actively
[04:07:04.390 --> 04:07:06.390]  screwing with the insects
[04:07:06.390 --> 04:07:08.390]  themselves but it's probably also in addition,
[04:07:08.390 --> 04:07:10.390]  we all know that putting
[04:07:10.390 --> 04:07:12.390]  liquid insect frost on the plants will
[04:07:12.390 --> 04:07:14.390]  absolutely increase that plant's
[04:07:14.390 --> 04:07:16.390]  immune system response as well so it might be
[04:07:16.390 --> 04:07:18.390]  both, realistically, but again
[04:07:18.390 --> 04:07:20.390]  I don't know the honest
[04:07:20.610 --> 04:07:22.610]  answer to that question.
[04:07:22.610 --> 04:07:24.610]  Cool. All I know is that it works well.
[04:07:26.610 --> 04:07:28.610]  I kind of got my brain buzzing. I'm like, what else
[04:07:28.610 --> 04:07:30.610]  can we put in the IMO and we put it out there?
[04:07:30.610 --> 04:07:32.610]  Like is earthworm casting going to do anything?
[04:07:32.610 --> 04:07:34.610]  Because that's going to attract, you know,
[04:07:34.610 --> 04:07:36.610]  like arthropods and some other larger stuff.
[04:07:38.610 --> 04:07:40.610]  My mind's buzzing right now.
[04:07:40.610 --> 04:07:42.610]  To me,
[04:07:42.610 --> 04:07:44.610]  if I can collect some
[04:07:44.610 --> 04:07:46.610]  local aphids and help put them into
[04:07:46.610 --> 04:07:48.610]  that insect grass and then I'm
[04:07:48.830 --> 04:07:50.830]  going to try and focus on, you know, again
[04:07:50.830 --> 04:07:52.830]  in theory, collecting those microbes that would prey
[04:07:52.830 --> 04:07:54.830]  upon them and you can kind of use that theory
[04:07:54.830 --> 04:07:56.830]  the same way that you go after saprophytic fungi.
[04:07:56.830 --> 04:07:58.830]  It's one thing I loved with
[04:07:58.830 --> 04:08:00.830]  K&F. Don't think of K&F as
[04:08:00.830 --> 04:08:02.830]  like a set, like K&F specifically
[04:08:02.830 --> 04:08:04.830]  under Master Cho's is a set recipe that
[04:08:04.830 --> 04:08:06.830]  works, that's been heavily tested,
[04:08:06.830 --> 04:08:08.830]  that's wonderful, but also think about
[04:08:08.830 --> 04:08:10.830]  K&F in a way separately from
[04:08:10.830 --> 04:08:12.830]  that as a machine that you can take
[04:08:12.830 --> 04:08:14.830]  inputs and create other
[04:08:14.830 --> 04:08:16.830]  inputs from and it could be
[04:08:17.050 --> 04:08:19.050]  taking horsetail or stinging
[04:08:19.050 --> 04:08:21.050]  nettle to
[04:08:21.050 --> 04:08:23.050]  increase silica concentration
[04:08:23.050 --> 04:08:25.050]  or it could be taking insect
[04:08:25.050 --> 04:08:27.050]  grass and fermenting it and using
[04:08:27.050 --> 04:08:29.050]  those microbes to collect something that can
[04:08:29.050 --> 04:08:31.050]  screw with your insects, but either way you can kind of
[04:08:31.050 --> 04:08:33.050]  take an input, use the
[04:08:33.050 --> 04:08:35.050]  fermentation or, you know,
[04:08:35.050 --> 04:08:37.050]  microbial process as a machine
[04:08:37.050 --> 04:08:39.050]  to get a different output and
[04:08:39.050 --> 04:08:41.050]  it can be, you know, again, anything from
[04:08:41.050 --> 04:08:43.050]  mineral inputs to pest control, but
[04:08:43.050 --> 04:08:45.050]  think about it in that way and less of
[04:08:45.270 --> 04:08:47.270]  you have to do A, B, and C to equal
[04:08:47.270 --> 04:08:49.270]  a D, you know what I mean? And a lot of
[04:08:49.270 --> 04:08:51.270]  people get really stuck on that
[04:08:51.270 --> 04:08:53.270]  and I think that there needs to
[04:08:53.270 --> 04:08:55.270]  be more of a wider, broader
[04:08:55.270 --> 04:08:57.270]  way of thinking. One of my favorite things and
[04:08:57.270 --> 04:08:59.270]  one of the things I've been working on quite heavily the last
[04:08:59.270 --> 04:09:01.270]  year and a half is taking
[04:09:01.270 --> 04:09:03.270]  what's the group, what is the
[04:09:03.270 --> 04:09:05.270]  university that put out the plant
[04:09:05.270 --> 04:09:07.270]  bioaccumulators?
[04:09:07.270 --> 04:09:09.270]  Give me two seconds, I can pull up
[04:09:09.270 --> 04:09:11.270]  the name of it. But they put out a
[04:09:11.270 --> 04:09:13.270]  plant bioaccumulation list and I've been taking
[04:09:13.490 --> 04:09:15.490]  a lot of those individually, fermenting them
[04:09:15.490 --> 04:09:17.490]  and then just sending them out for mineral analysis
[04:09:17.490 --> 04:09:19.490]  when we send out for aquaponic mineral analysis
[04:09:19.490 --> 04:09:21.490]  just to find out, okay, if I ferment
[04:09:21.490 --> 04:09:23.490]  this many pounds of this with equal parts of
[04:09:23.490 --> 04:09:25.490]  lactobacillus or an FPJ,
[04:09:25.490 --> 04:09:27.490]  what's the output in minerals? And just
[04:09:27.490 --> 04:09:29.490]  documenting that and figuring out, hey, okay,
[04:09:29.490 --> 04:09:31.490]  cool, we could absolutely do hydroponics
[04:09:31.490 --> 04:09:33.490]  or aquaponics and replace the
[04:09:33.490 --> 04:09:35.490]  baby bottles and the mineral salts
[04:09:35.490 --> 04:09:37.490]  with these exact, you know, here's
[04:09:37.490 --> 04:09:39.490]  something where I can say, you ferment this,
[04:09:39.490 --> 04:09:41.490]  it's going to give you this range of PPMs
[04:09:41.710 --> 04:09:43.710]  in a similar manner to the control
[04:09:43.710 --> 04:09:45.710]  you have with the salts, but
[04:09:45.710 --> 04:09:47.710]  in a way that's natural
[04:09:47.710 --> 04:09:49.710]  farming that we can feel good about and
[04:09:49.710 --> 04:09:51.710]  we can all get behind in that
[04:09:51.710 --> 04:09:53.710]  same kind of way. So kind of hybridizing
[04:09:53.710 --> 04:09:55.710]  the old and the new in that way and trying
[04:09:55.710 --> 04:09:57.710]  to define that down to more
[04:09:57.710 --> 04:09:59.710]  definitive numbers that we can actually use to
[04:09:59.710 --> 04:10:01.710]  dial into that same level of control that
[04:10:01.710 --> 04:10:03.710]  we're used to having with some of the
[04:10:03.710 --> 04:10:05.710]  synthetic methods.
[04:10:05.710 --> 04:10:07.710]  I feel like the final
[04:10:07.710 --> 04:10:09.710]  step to that will be to actually cultivate the
[04:10:09.930 --> 04:10:11.930]  plants on the land that you intend to use
[04:10:11.930 --> 04:10:13.930]  the products on so that you're actually
[04:10:13.930 --> 04:10:15.930]  culturing it the whole way.
[04:10:15.930 --> 04:10:17.930]  You're supposed to loop.
[04:10:17.930 --> 04:10:19.930]  Absolutely.
[04:10:23.930 --> 04:10:25.930]  What I've been experimenting with on my indoors
[04:10:25.930 --> 04:10:27.930]  is keeping almost like a chitinase
[04:10:27.930 --> 04:10:29.930]  or a chitin cycle going on. I have
[04:10:29.930 --> 04:10:31.930]  this raging population of
[04:10:31.930 --> 04:10:33.930]  stradiose in there and
[04:10:33.930 --> 04:10:35.930]  as well as some other stuff,
[04:10:35.930 --> 04:10:37.930]  but now I've gotten
[04:10:38.150 --> 04:10:40.150]  this huge explosion of mold mites due to
[04:10:40.150 --> 04:10:42.150]  me introducing mushroom fruiting
[04:10:42.150 --> 04:10:44.150]  blocks. Like prolific.
[04:10:44.150 --> 04:10:46.150]  It's a coating of
[04:10:46.150 --> 04:10:48.150]  everything. So now I'm introducing
[04:10:48.150 --> 04:10:50.150]  predators to try to knock them back, although
[04:10:50.150 --> 04:10:52.150]  they're not chewing on my plants. I just
[04:10:52.150 --> 04:10:54.150]  envision them sort of
[04:10:54.150 --> 04:10:56.150]  starting this natural cycle indoors
[04:10:56.150 --> 04:10:58.150]  as would happen outside and just
[04:10:58.150 --> 04:11:00.150]  keeping this cycle of
[04:11:00.150 --> 04:11:02.150]  these bugs dying and decomposing
[04:11:02.150 --> 04:11:04.150]  in my soil and using that as
[04:11:04.150 --> 04:11:06.150]  a driver on the plant. Not only my feeding
[04:11:06.370 --> 04:11:08.370]  but keeping that secondary
[04:11:08.370 --> 04:11:10.370]  system going with the worms
[04:11:10.370 --> 04:11:12.370]  and the arthropods and just
[04:11:12.370 --> 04:11:14.370]  focusing on keeping that cycle
[04:11:14.370 --> 04:11:16.370]  as healthy as possible beyond
[04:11:16.370 --> 04:11:18.370]  other simple plant health
[04:11:18.370 --> 04:11:20.370]  and PK shit.
[04:11:20.370 --> 04:11:22.370]  It's funny. I had noticed the same result in my beds
[04:11:22.370 --> 04:11:24.370]  when I added the
[04:11:24.370 --> 04:11:26.370]  mushroom block. I call them mushroom block because
[04:11:26.370 --> 04:11:28.370]  they're in a bag. Once they get close
[04:11:28.370 --> 04:11:30.370]  I throw that whole bag. Either you feed it to the
[04:11:30.370 --> 04:11:32.370]  worms or I threw it in my living soil.
[04:11:32.370 --> 04:11:34.370]  I have living cocoa, not living peat.
[04:11:34.590 --> 04:11:36.590]  I have a living cocoa bed and
[04:11:36.590 --> 04:11:38.590]  it's rocking. I have tons of those
[04:11:38.590 --> 04:11:40.590]  mites. If you get predator
[04:11:40.590 --> 04:11:42.590]  mites, you'll see those in there too.
[04:11:42.590 --> 04:11:44.590]  They're like the fodder. That's what's
[04:11:44.590 --> 04:11:46.590]  keeping those predators alive.
[04:11:46.590 --> 04:11:48.590]  I'm just happy to see them because
[04:11:48.590 --> 04:11:50.590]  they don't eat the plant and my predators eat them.
[04:11:50.590 --> 04:11:52.590]  They're actually
[04:11:52.590 --> 04:11:54.590]  what comes in the sachets.
[04:11:54.590 --> 04:11:56.590]  That's what they have in the sachets to feed them.
[04:11:56.590 --> 04:11:58.590]  Those mold mites.
[04:11:58.590 --> 04:12:00.590]  I just have this rocking population of them
[04:12:00.590 --> 04:12:02.590]  going on now. They're literally driving
[04:12:02.810 --> 04:12:04.810]  the car right now in my
[04:12:04.810 --> 04:12:06.810]  system. It's crazy. I'm just providing
[04:12:06.810 --> 04:12:08.810]  water and I put my pod down and I
[04:12:08.810 --> 04:12:10.810]  just observe. This cycle
[04:12:10.810 --> 04:12:12.810]  of life and death going on in there is
[04:12:12.810 --> 04:12:14.810]  incredible. It's amazing.
[04:12:14.810 --> 04:12:16.810]  It's on more of a macro level
[04:12:16.810 --> 04:12:18.810]  so I can almost see it. I know that's happening on
[04:12:18.810 --> 04:12:20.810]  a micro level within the soil. Unless I
[04:12:20.810 --> 04:12:22.810]  scope it, I can't see it.
[04:12:22.810 --> 04:12:24.810]  This is something you can just literally observe
[04:12:24.810 --> 04:12:26.810]  which is such a clue to
[04:12:26.810 --> 04:12:28.810]  the right thing is going on in your
[04:12:28.810 --> 04:12:30.810]  soils if this
[04:12:31.030 --> 04:12:33.030]  invisible system is happening.
[04:12:35.030 --> 04:12:37.030]  By the way, Tyler, whatever you smoked
[04:12:37.030 --> 04:12:39.030]  tonight knocked you out.
[04:12:39.030 --> 04:12:41.030]  I love your...
[04:12:41.030 --> 04:12:43.030]  I see your eyes very
[04:12:43.030 --> 04:12:45.030]  infrequently tonight. Yes.
[04:12:45.030 --> 04:12:47.030]  Tell us about that.
[04:12:47.030 --> 04:12:49.030]  That's the SBR. My baby SBR.
[04:12:49.030 --> 04:12:51.030]  12 rounds in this
[04:12:51.030 --> 04:12:53.030]  specific loving soil and it's
[04:12:53.030 --> 04:12:55.030]  just tuned
[04:12:55.030 --> 04:12:57.030]  to me. Me and it are
[04:12:57.030 --> 04:12:59.030]  in love.
[04:12:59.250 --> 04:13:01.250]  I hope everybody can get
[04:13:01.250 --> 04:13:03.250]  a strain like that in your life that you're so
[04:13:03.250 --> 04:13:05.250]  in love with.
[04:13:05.250 --> 04:13:07.250]  It makes me feel
[04:13:07.250 --> 04:13:09.250]  great and creative.
[04:13:09.250 --> 04:13:11.250]  I love it.
[04:13:11.250 --> 04:13:13.250]  Just thinking back on
[04:13:13.250 --> 04:13:15.250]  Steve's recipe with the insects,
[04:13:15.250 --> 04:13:17.250]  it's going to attract, like we were saying
[04:13:17.250 --> 04:13:19.250]  with the chitin, because the chitin's added,
[04:13:19.250 --> 04:13:21.250]  it's going to attract the microbes that can
[04:13:21.250 --> 04:13:23.250]  produce chitinase which will...
[04:13:23.250 --> 04:13:25.250]  Am I saying it right? Steve said
[04:13:25.250 --> 04:13:27.250]  chitin differently. I don't know if my
[04:13:27.470 --> 04:13:29.470]  pronunciation is right.
[04:13:29.470 --> 04:13:31.470]  I think I'm saying it. My pronunciation
[04:13:31.470 --> 04:13:33.470]  comes from Morrowind
[04:13:33.470 --> 04:13:35.470]  or Elder Scrolls. It's chitin.
[04:13:35.470 --> 04:13:37.470]  Oh, okay.
[04:13:37.470 --> 04:13:39.470]  It sounded familiar. I didn't know where I heard that before.
[04:13:41.470 --> 04:13:43.470]  Now I lost my train. Oh, I think
[04:13:43.470 --> 04:13:45.470]  it's more of a general pesticide because think
[04:13:45.470 --> 04:13:47.470]  about it. How many
[04:13:47.470 --> 04:13:49.470]  insects are made of chitin? That's their
[04:13:49.470 --> 04:13:51.470]  exoskeleton on a majority
[04:13:51.470 --> 04:13:53.470]  of them, I would imagine.
[04:13:53.470 --> 04:13:55.470]  All you got to do is... It doesn't have
[04:13:55.690 --> 04:13:57.690]  to be... If it has
[04:13:57.690 --> 04:13:59.690]  chitin as an exoskeleton, just use anything
[04:13:59.690 --> 04:14:01.690]  else that has chitin as an exoskeleton. It doesn't
[04:14:01.690 --> 04:14:03.690]  have to be that specific
[04:14:03.690 --> 04:14:05.690]  bug. I just wanted to clear that up.
[04:14:05.690 --> 04:14:07.690]  I wonder what would happen
[04:14:07.690 --> 04:14:09.690]  if you used... Because we can
[04:14:09.690 --> 04:14:11.690]  culture soldier fly larvae
[04:14:11.690 --> 04:14:13.690]  and they're a great source of chitin.
[04:14:13.690 --> 04:14:15.690]  What would happen if you, I don't know,
[04:14:15.690 --> 04:14:17.690]  froze them maybe and then
[04:14:17.690 --> 04:14:19.690]  thawed them out and then added them to the IMO?
[04:14:19.690 --> 04:14:21.690]  That would kill them off to create the
[04:14:21.690 --> 04:14:23.690]  bodies that you'd need for the IMO
[04:14:23.910 --> 04:14:25.910]  Very little effort.
[04:14:25.910 --> 04:14:27.910]  I was
[04:14:27.910 --> 04:14:29.910]  going to say the chitin is also
[04:14:29.910 --> 04:14:31.910]  what most of the eggs are made out of, too.
[04:14:31.910 --> 04:14:33.910]  If you have chitinase
[04:14:33.910 --> 04:14:35.910]  going onto your plants,
[04:14:35.910 --> 04:14:37.910]  it'll not only kill the adults, but it'll
[04:14:37.910 --> 04:14:39.910]  knock back the eggs as well.
[04:14:39.910 --> 04:14:41.910]  When we were in South
[04:14:41.910 --> 04:14:43.910]  Korea,
[04:14:43.910 --> 04:14:45.910]  it was supposed to be a natural
[04:14:45.910 --> 04:14:47.910]  farming thing and it ended up being just a real
[04:14:47.910 --> 04:14:49.910]  big sales pitch for a product
[04:14:49.910 --> 04:14:51.910]  that Professor Kim was calling GCM.
[04:14:52.130 --> 04:14:54.130]  He's renamed it like four times.
[04:14:54.130 --> 04:14:56.130]  It's basically...
[04:14:56.130 --> 04:14:58.130]  What he told us it was... We found out
[04:14:58.130 --> 04:15:00.130]  what it really is, which is a bacillus
[04:15:00.130 --> 04:15:02.130]  species. It's Bacillus
[04:15:02.130 --> 04:15:04.130]  Bellazensis.
[04:15:04.130 --> 04:15:06.130]  We caught that because
[04:15:06.130 --> 04:15:08.130]  his TA took us up to
[04:15:08.130 --> 04:15:10.130]  the lab and we found all their papers
[04:15:10.130 --> 04:15:12.130]  on the wall. We were all taking pictures
[04:15:12.130 --> 04:15:14.130]  of it.
[04:15:14.130 --> 04:15:16.130]  Basically,
[04:15:16.130 --> 04:15:18.130]  it's a bacillus species that he isolated
[04:15:18.130 --> 04:15:20.130]  from indigenous microorganism collection
[04:15:20.350 --> 04:15:22.350]  and it's up in the woods.
[04:15:22.350 --> 04:15:24.350]  It just happens to have a very,
[04:15:24.350 --> 04:15:26.350]  very high rate of
[04:15:26.350 --> 04:15:28.350]  the gelatinase and chitinase
[04:15:28.350 --> 04:15:30.350]  enzymes that it produces.
[04:15:30.350 --> 04:15:32.350]  When you're brewing out this microbe,
[04:15:32.350 --> 04:15:34.350]  you're not really brewing out the microbe.
[04:15:34.350 --> 04:15:36.350]  You're actually getting all the enzymes
[04:15:36.350 --> 04:15:38.350]  that it's producing, which in
[04:15:38.350 --> 04:15:40.350]  the majority is gelatinase and chitinase.
[04:15:40.350 --> 04:15:42.350]  That, in turn, will kill the bugs on
[04:15:42.350 --> 04:15:44.350]  your plants.
[04:15:44.350 --> 04:15:46.350]  It's another nod
[04:15:46.350 --> 04:15:48.350]  to doing things yourself because you don't
[04:15:48.570 --> 04:15:50.570]  know what you have naturally in your environment
[04:15:50.570 --> 04:15:52.570]  and in your soil. Nature generally
[04:15:52.570 --> 04:15:54.570]  wants to find a balance.
[04:15:54.570 --> 04:15:56.570]  If we're not producing these
[04:15:56.570 --> 04:15:58.570]  huge monocrops of just
[04:15:58.570 --> 04:16:00.570]  one thing,
[04:16:00.570 --> 04:16:02.570]  when we're outside, when you're inside, it's kind of different.
[04:16:02.570 --> 04:16:04.570]  You definitely have to manipulate the environment
[04:16:04.570 --> 04:16:06.570]  a lot more because it is a manipulated
[04:16:06.570 --> 04:16:08.570]  environment. When you're outside,
[04:16:08.570 --> 04:16:10.570]  adding those things that
[04:16:10.570 --> 04:16:12.570]  might attract other bugs and might attract
[04:16:12.570 --> 04:16:14.570]  a natural
[04:16:14.570 --> 04:16:16.570]  microbe that will do that
[04:16:16.790 --> 04:16:18.790]  for you, it's a lot easier.
[04:16:18.790 --> 04:16:20.790]  It's not about you having to really mess
[04:16:20.790 --> 04:16:22.790]  with it. It can really make
[04:16:22.790 --> 04:16:24.790]  things a lot easier.
[04:16:24.790 --> 04:16:26.790]  I know that we had
[04:16:26.790 --> 04:16:28.790]  actually...we had root aphids
[04:16:28.790 --> 04:16:30.790]  two years ago.
[04:16:30.790 --> 04:16:32.790]  I went to go buy Bavaria baciana.
[04:16:32.790 --> 04:16:34.790]  In California, you have to have an operator
[04:16:34.790 --> 04:16:36.790]  license, but our grow store told me I had
[04:16:36.790 --> 04:16:38.790]  to have a pesticide applicator's license.
[04:16:38.790 --> 04:16:40.790]  It took me a week to go up and take the test
[04:16:40.790 --> 04:16:42.790]  and study and do the whole thing.
[04:16:42.790 --> 04:16:44.790]  Then we got up there.
[04:16:45.010 --> 04:16:47.010]  I'm taking the test now.
[04:16:47.010 --> 04:16:49.010]  By the time I finally got the Bavaria baciana
[04:16:49.010 --> 04:16:51.010]  and I was talking with
[04:16:51.010 --> 04:16:53.010]  the people, the scientists
[04:16:53.010 --> 04:16:55.010]  at
[04:16:55.010 --> 04:16:57.010]  BioWorks, right?
[04:16:57.010 --> 04:16:59.010]  They're the ones who produce it? I always forget.
[04:16:59.010 --> 04:17:01.010]  Anyway, I was talking with them
[04:17:01.010 --> 04:17:03.010]  and they wanted me to do a protocol
[04:17:03.010 --> 04:17:05.010]  of the wetting powder,
[04:17:05.010 --> 04:17:07.010]  the wettable powder versus the liquid.
[04:17:07.010 --> 04:17:09.010]  I was developing this protocol with them
[04:17:09.010 --> 04:17:11.010]  and I went to go find my infested
[04:17:11.010 --> 04:17:13.010]  plants.
[04:17:13.230 --> 04:17:15.230]  By the time I got my Bavaria
[04:17:15.230 --> 04:17:17.230]  baciana and started doing the protocol,
[04:17:17.230 --> 04:17:19.230]  I couldn't find them anymore.
[04:17:19.230 --> 04:17:21.230]  I was like, this is so incredibly
[04:17:21.230 --> 04:17:23.230]  strange. I can't figure out where they
[04:17:23.230 --> 04:17:25.230]  went. Finally, I
[04:17:25.230 --> 04:17:27.230]  realized that they were covered
[04:17:27.230 --> 04:17:29.230]  in fungi.
[04:17:29.230 --> 04:17:31.230]  They looked like white little powder poofs
[04:17:31.230 --> 04:17:33.230]  everywhere.
[04:17:33.230 --> 04:17:35.230]  I had something naturally in my
[04:17:35.230 --> 04:17:37.230]  soil. I'd never used Bavaria baciana
[04:17:37.230 --> 04:17:39.230]  before, but it
[04:17:39.230 --> 04:17:41.230]  killed everything within eight days.
[04:17:41.450 --> 04:17:43.450]  Within eight days, I had almost 100%
[04:17:43.450 --> 04:17:45.450]  eradication of root aphids
[04:17:45.450 --> 04:17:47.450]  naturally. We ended up
[04:17:47.450 --> 04:17:49.450]  sending those off to Cornell University
[04:17:49.450 --> 04:17:51.450]  and to BioWorks and they were
[04:17:51.450 --> 04:17:53.450]  inoculating and breeding it
[04:17:53.450 --> 04:17:55.450]  out and seeing if it's recreatable or not.
[04:17:55.450 --> 04:17:57.450]  I have not heard back,
[04:17:57.450 --> 04:17:59.450]  but apparently it's a very, very long
[04:17:59.450 --> 04:18:01.450]  process to try and do that.
[04:18:03.450 --> 04:18:05.450]  Again, whatever is out there
[04:18:05.450 --> 04:18:07.450]  in nature, you may have your
[04:18:07.450 --> 04:18:09.450]  solution sitting right in front of you without
[04:18:09.670 --> 04:18:11.670]  a problem.
[04:18:11.670 --> 04:18:13.670]  Absolutely. Hey, Kevin, I say you say
[04:18:13.670 --> 04:18:15.670]  goodbye to everybody before you take off.
[04:18:15.670 --> 04:18:17.670]  You're going to get ready to take off.
[04:18:17.670 --> 04:18:19.670]  I know. I called you out
[04:18:19.670 --> 04:18:21.670]  on it. You're muted.
[04:18:21.670 --> 04:18:23.670]  I'm unmuted.
[04:18:23.670 --> 04:18:25.670]  Thank you so much.
[04:18:25.670 --> 04:18:27.670]  I had a wonderful time. This was a great show.
[04:18:27.670 --> 04:18:29.670]  They're all great shows.
[04:18:29.670 --> 04:18:31.670]  Like I said, man, it's always a
[04:18:31.670 --> 04:18:33.670]  privilege to get to hang out with
[04:18:33.670 --> 04:18:35.670]  so many really talented, interesting
[04:18:35.670 --> 04:18:37.670]  people. Thank you so much for letting
[04:18:37.890 --> 04:18:39.890]  me be a part of this. Much love to all of you.
[04:18:47.060 --> 04:18:49.060]  And now Steve's back
[04:18:49.060 --> 04:18:51.060]  in his chair ready to recline.
[04:18:51.060 --> 04:18:53.060]  He's already out of the pool.
[04:18:53.060 --> 04:18:55.060]  It was great to hang with Steve.
[04:18:55.060 --> 04:18:57.060]  I'm over here. I'm over here in my
[04:18:57.060 --> 04:18:59.060]  back deck, sitting in a hardback.
[04:18:59.060 --> 04:19:01.060]  He's in a pool laying back in a lounge.
[04:19:01.060 --> 04:19:03.060]  I'm like, I got to get some lessons here.
[04:19:03.060 --> 04:19:05.060]  I need to learn how to chill a little harder.
[04:19:05.060 --> 04:19:07.060]  And I'm here hanging
[04:19:07.060 --> 04:19:09.060]  up fucking plants right now.
[04:19:09.060 --> 04:19:11.060]  That's classic. That's why you get
[04:19:11.280 --> 04:19:13.280]  the mutant.
[04:19:13.280 --> 04:19:15.280]  No gangsta shit seen on TV.
[04:19:15.280 --> 04:19:17.280]  Nice chatting with you, Kevin.
[04:19:17.280 --> 04:19:19.280]  I hope we do it again sometime.
[04:19:19.280 --> 04:19:21.280]  No guarantee, man. It was a pleasure, Steve.
[04:19:21.280 --> 04:19:23.280]  We're on, my brother. Right on.
[04:19:23.280 --> 04:19:25.280]  Thank you all. You too.
[04:19:25.280 --> 04:19:27.280]  All right. Thanks, Kevin.
[04:19:27.280 --> 04:19:29.280]  Thank you, Peter. Wonderful time.
[04:19:29.280 --> 04:19:31.280]  Thank you so much.
[04:19:33.280 --> 04:19:35.280]  All right. So you guys want to keep going for a little bit?
[04:19:35.280 --> 04:19:37.280]  I have no idea how many people are watching right now.
[04:19:37.500 --> 04:19:39.500]  I'm probably going to have to jet.
[04:19:39.500 --> 04:19:41.500]  It's getting pretty late out here on the east side
[04:19:41.500 --> 04:19:43.500]  of the country.
[04:19:43.500 --> 04:19:45.500]  457 people so far.
[04:19:45.500 --> 04:19:47.500]  I think
[04:19:47.500 --> 04:19:49.500]  we got a little time for Steve
[04:19:49.500 --> 04:19:51.500]  to talk about his
[04:19:51.500 --> 04:19:53.500]  root aphids. I was just
[04:19:53.500 --> 04:19:55.500]  going to say, Steve had a root
[04:19:55.500 --> 04:19:57.500]  aphid spray. I'm getting rid of some. I want to hear about
[04:19:57.500 --> 04:19:59.500]  that too, because that's a difficult
[04:19:59.500 --> 04:20:01.500]  one for most people.
[04:20:01.500 --> 04:20:03.500]  So I had a client,
[04:20:03.500 --> 04:20:05.500]  this was a vegetable aquaponic client.
[04:20:05.720 --> 04:20:07.720]  And aquaponics, root aphids are hell
[04:20:07.720 --> 04:20:09.720]  to get rid of because root aphids
[04:20:09.720 --> 04:20:11.720]  love swampy environments.
[04:20:11.720 --> 04:20:13.720]  I also can't hit them with anything
[04:20:13.720 --> 04:20:15.720]  heavy because it'll kill the fish because they're right
[04:20:15.720 --> 04:20:17.720]  at that water layer. They love to be
[04:20:17.720 --> 04:20:19.720]  within a half inch or an inch of the water.
[04:20:19.720 --> 04:20:21.720]  And good luck
[04:20:21.720 --> 04:20:23.720]  if you're trying to, what could you
[04:20:23.720 --> 04:20:25.720]  possibly spray with them? So
[04:20:25.720 --> 04:20:27.720]  what we had really good luck with, and this took
[04:20:27.720 --> 04:20:29.720]  about
[04:20:29.720 --> 04:20:31.720]  four or five weeks to finally eliminate
[04:20:31.720 --> 04:20:33.720]  them. And then
[04:20:33.940 --> 04:20:35.940]  we continued maintenance for eight weeks
[04:20:35.940 --> 04:20:37.940]  after that.
[04:20:37.940 --> 04:20:39.940]  What we did was
[04:20:39.940 --> 04:20:41.940]  we did a rotation of first off
[04:20:41.940 --> 04:20:43.940]  one week
[04:20:43.940 --> 04:20:45.940]  of Bavaria Bessonia
[04:20:45.940 --> 04:20:47.940]  PFR 97
[04:20:47.940 --> 04:20:49.940]  which is
[04:20:49.940 --> 04:20:51.940]  hold on a second
[04:20:51.940 --> 04:20:53.940]  make sure I
[04:20:53.940 --> 04:20:55.940]  get this right so I have
[04:20:55.940 --> 04:20:57.940]  these open
[04:20:57.940 --> 04:20:59.940]  alright
[04:20:59.940 --> 04:21:01.940]  Pellicillomyces
[04:21:02.160 --> 04:21:04.160]  Myces Fumosarius which is
[04:21:04.160 --> 04:21:06.160]  PF 97
[04:21:06.160 --> 04:21:08.160]  Bavaria Bessonia
[04:21:08.160 --> 04:21:10.160]  which you guys have talked about already
[04:21:10.160 --> 04:21:12.160]  and then Apopka
[04:21:12.160 --> 04:21:14.160]  strain 97 which is a product
[04:21:14.160 --> 04:21:16.160]  called
[04:21:18.160 --> 04:21:20.160]  Acura
[04:21:20.160 --> 04:21:22.160]  I believe it's called is the brand name
[04:21:24.160 --> 04:21:26.160]  and then we had a different
[04:21:26.160 --> 04:21:28.160]  product called Ceres which is
[04:21:28.160 --> 04:21:30.160]  a different strain of Bavaria
[04:21:30.380 --> 04:21:32.380]  Bessonia
[04:21:32.380 --> 04:21:34.380]  and then we had a
[04:21:34.380 --> 04:21:36.380]  rotation of those and we were doing a
[04:21:36.380 --> 04:21:38.380]  spray of those every other day
[04:21:38.380 --> 04:21:40.380]  because most of those only have a 24 to 48
[04:21:40.380 --> 04:21:42.380]  hour effective window
[04:21:42.380 --> 04:21:44.380]  so we were doing a spray every other day
[04:21:44.380 --> 04:21:46.380]  for one week to knock them back
[04:21:46.380 --> 04:21:48.380]  and then we did a mass
[04:21:48.380 --> 04:21:50.380]  mass release and I'm talking like triple
[04:21:50.380 --> 04:21:52.380]  what the recommendation is for a normal
[04:21:52.380 --> 04:21:54.380]  greenhouse of
[04:21:54.380 --> 04:21:56.380]  Rove beetles
[04:21:56.380 --> 04:21:58.380]  Rove beetles are the
[04:21:58.600 --> 04:22:00.600]  and then we came in the week after that did a mass
[04:22:00.600 --> 04:22:02.600]  release of
[04:22:02.600 --> 04:22:04.600]  Lacewing larva and then
[04:22:04.600 --> 04:22:06.600]  weekly releases of
[04:22:06.600 --> 04:22:08.600]  the normal release rate of the
[04:22:08.600 --> 04:22:10.600]  Rove beetles
[04:22:10.600 --> 04:22:12.600]  and we were able to use that specifically
[04:22:12.600 --> 04:22:14.600]  basically overrun them with Rove
[04:22:14.600 --> 04:22:16.600]  knock the population back with the fungi
[04:22:16.600 --> 04:22:18.600]  and then overrun them with predators
[04:22:18.600 --> 04:22:20.600]  and you know they weren't able to
[04:22:20.600 --> 04:22:22.600]  out breed it and that was
[04:22:22.600 --> 04:22:24.600]  the other thing that I also noticed
[04:22:24.600 --> 04:22:26.600]  at this client because
[04:22:26.820 --> 04:22:28.820]  I think it started on the cilantro
[04:22:28.820 --> 04:22:30.820]  but we actually planted some more cilantro
[04:22:30.820 --> 04:22:32.820]  and we were actually using the cilantro
[04:22:32.820 --> 04:22:34.820]  interplanted everywhere as bait
[04:22:34.820 --> 04:22:36.820]  they were coming off of the other plants
[04:22:36.820 --> 04:22:38.820]  and going directly to the cilantro for whatever
[04:22:38.820 --> 04:22:40.820]  reason they just loved
[04:22:40.820 --> 04:22:42.820]  the living shit out of cilantro
[04:22:42.820 --> 04:22:44.820]  so we were able to
[04:22:44.820 --> 04:22:46.820]  plant a ton of bait plants and just replace
[04:22:46.820 --> 04:22:48.820]  those once a week
[04:22:48.820 --> 04:22:50.820]  and have them in the nursery and just
[04:22:50.820 --> 04:22:52.820]  constantly replace them and then physically just
[04:22:52.820 --> 04:22:54.820]  throwing them away
[04:22:55.040 --> 04:22:57.040]  and by doing that we were able to kind of concentrate
[04:22:57.040 --> 04:22:59.040]  them while spraying and releasing
[04:22:59.040 --> 04:23:01.040]  and able to get the room back under control
[04:23:01.040 --> 04:23:03.040]  it's a veg room so it wasn't
[04:23:03.040 --> 04:23:05.040]  you know if we had to trash
[04:23:05.040 --> 04:23:07.040]  everything we could if we had to use something
[04:23:07.040 --> 04:23:09.040]  harsher we could but I could use all
[04:23:09.040 --> 04:23:11.040]  of those products and not have to worry about the
[04:23:11.040 --> 04:23:13.040]  fish safetiness of it
[04:23:13.040 --> 04:23:15.040]  if I spray it in the water none of those are
[04:23:15.040 --> 04:23:17.040]  going to hurt the fish and that
[04:23:17.040 --> 04:23:19.040]  was how we were able to eliminate it
[04:23:19.040 --> 04:23:21.040]  but again we had to basically knock them back
[04:23:21.040 --> 04:23:23.040]  with the typical bio
[04:23:23.260 --> 04:23:25.260]  agents and then overrun them with the
[04:23:25.260 --> 04:23:27.260]  dilaudids
[04:23:27.260 --> 04:23:29.260]  or dolatias or whatever they're called
[04:23:29.260 --> 04:23:31.260]  the rove beetles
[04:23:31.260 --> 04:23:33.260]  and that really was the one two combo that seemed to work
[04:23:33.260 --> 04:23:35.260]  that's really
[04:23:35.260 --> 04:23:37.260]  interesting because I had
[04:23:37.260 --> 04:23:39.260]  probably been a couple years now but I had broad mites really bad
[04:23:39.260 --> 04:23:41.260]  and I did
[04:23:41.260 --> 04:23:43.260]  you know it's the other end of the plant
[04:23:43.260 --> 04:23:45.260]  but I did the same thing I knocked them back with
[04:23:45.260 --> 04:23:47.260]  some pretty heavy
[04:23:47.260 --> 04:23:49.260]  sprays and then I just
[04:23:49.260 --> 04:23:51.260]  I always refer to it as a D-Day
[04:23:51.480 --> 04:23:53.480]  type invasion because I just
[04:23:53.480 --> 04:23:55.480]  25,000 in a 4x4 tent
[04:23:55.480 --> 04:23:57.480]  I mean I totally overkilled it
[04:23:57.480 --> 04:23:59.480]  but it decimated
[04:23:59.480 --> 04:24:01.480]  those broad mites and I was
[04:24:01.480 --> 04:24:03.480]  back to good within like
[04:24:03.480 --> 04:24:05.480]  five weeks and I've
[04:24:05.480 --> 04:24:07.480]  watched people struggle with broad mites and russet mites
[04:24:07.480 --> 04:24:09.480]  for months and lose their
[04:24:09.480 --> 04:24:11.480]  whole garden and lose everything they've ever
[04:24:11.480 --> 04:24:13.480]  had and that was
[04:24:13.480 --> 04:24:15.480]  the only thing that I found that worked for me so it's
[04:24:15.480 --> 04:24:17.480]  interesting that you did that with the other end of the
[04:24:17.480 --> 04:24:19.480]  plant in an aquaponics system
[04:24:19.700 --> 04:24:21.700]  with a different insect and it still worked
[04:24:26.320 --> 04:24:28.320]  Oh yeah and that really has
[04:24:28.320 --> 04:24:30.320]  been the
[04:24:30.320 --> 04:24:32.320]  I've dealt with beetles a couple times
[04:24:32.320 --> 04:24:34.320]  or the root aphids rather
[04:24:34.320 --> 04:24:36.320]  and that really always was the
[04:24:36.320 --> 04:24:38.320]  the rove beetles always has been the way to go
[04:24:38.320 --> 04:24:40.320]  the first time I ever encountered them was in the showroom
[04:24:40.320 --> 04:24:42.320]  at the aquaponics source
[04:24:42.320 --> 04:24:44.320]  we were kind of one of the only hydro stores
[04:24:44.320 --> 04:24:46.320]  at the time in Longmont, Colorado
[04:24:46.320 --> 04:24:48.320]  so we had all, anyone that had insect problems
[04:24:48.320 --> 04:24:50.320]  was coming to us so we had every
[04:24:50.540 --> 04:24:52.540]  we had spider mites, russet, we had everything constantly
[04:24:52.540 --> 04:24:54.540]  anyone that has a hydro shop
[04:24:54.540 --> 04:24:56.540]  knows everyone brings everything
[04:24:56.540 --> 04:24:58.540]  with them to work
[04:24:58.540 --> 04:25:00.540]  to the hydro shop so it's just
[04:25:00.540 --> 04:25:02.540]  the last place where you should ever touch a plant
[04:25:02.540 --> 04:25:04.540]  I'll put it that way
[04:25:04.540 --> 04:25:06.540]  but that was the
[04:25:06.540 --> 04:25:08.540]  first time so we tried all kinds of goofy
[04:25:08.540 --> 04:25:10.540]  stuff with the aquaponics we even tried
[04:25:10.540 --> 04:25:12.540]  running a long
[04:25:12.540 --> 04:25:14.540]  like four to six inch air stones
[04:25:14.540 --> 04:25:16.540]  and sticking them in the grow beds
[04:25:16.540 --> 04:25:18.540]  flooding the beds by pulling up the bell siphons
[04:25:18.760 --> 04:25:20.760]  and then
[04:25:20.760 --> 04:25:22.760]  flash injecting CO2 to flash
[04:25:22.760 --> 04:25:24.760]  crash the pH of the water and physically
[04:25:24.760 --> 04:25:26.760]  just dissolve them in the water like acid
[04:25:26.760 --> 04:25:28.760]  with the low pH
[04:25:28.760 --> 04:25:30.760]  and that worked pretty well but
[04:25:30.760 --> 04:25:32.760]  it also killed all the cycling microbes
[04:25:32.760 --> 04:25:34.760]  that were on the material
[04:25:34.760 --> 04:25:36.760]  so you know
[04:25:36.760 --> 04:25:38.760]  while it worked for killing everything it also killed
[04:25:38.760 --> 04:25:40.760]  all my microbes and I had to recycle the system
[04:25:40.760 --> 04:25:42.760]  so it kind of defeated that but the plants did survive
[04:25:42.760 --> 04:25:44.760]  you know the very
[04:25:44.760 --> 04:25:46.760]  two minutes
[04:25:46.980 --> 04:25:48.980]  of pH change before going back to normal
[04:25:48.980 --> 04:25:50.980]  it wasn't a big deal but
[04:25:50.980 --> 04:25:52.980]  again I wouldn't suggest
[04:25:52.980 --> 04:25:54.980]  doing that but it does work
[04:25:54.980 --> 04:25:56.980]  but again the Rove beetles
[04:25:56.980 --> 04:25:58.980]  and then starting off with a heavy
[04:25:58.980 --> 04:26:00.980]  heavy dose of biocontrol one to two weeks
[04:26:00.980 --> 04:26:02.980]  of that every other day and just knocking it
[04:26:02.980 --> 04:26:04.980]  down and then over running it with the Rove beetles
[04:26:04.980 --> 04:26:06.980]  has been the only thing that I've seen that has any
[04:26:06.980 --> 04:26:08.980]  amount of work or any kind of
[04:26:08.980 --> 04:26:10.980]  success with the root aphids because I've tried
[04:26:10.980 --> 04:26:12.980]  before that I tried Ervi
[04:26:12.980 --> 04:26:14.980]  Aphidilis ervi they don't do
[04:26:15.200 --> 04:26:17.200]  we tried Aphidias
[04:26:17.200 --> 04:26:19.200]  hold on
[04:26:19.200 --> 04:26:21.200]  I could tell you the list of everything I've thrown at them
[04:26:21.200 --> 04:26:23.200]  I've written it down hold on a second
[04:26:25.200 --> 04:26:27.200]  did you try the Stynurnema
[04:26:27.200 --> 04:26:29.200]  nematodes
[04:26:29.200 --> 04:26:31.200]  so the nematodes
[04:26:31.200 --> 04:26:33.200]  definitely
[04:26:33.200 --> 04:26:35.200]  help but they don't
[04:26:35.200 --> 04:26:37.200]  solve it right
[04:26:37.200 --> 04:26:39.200]  well that's what
[04:26:39.200 --> 04:26:41.200]  I was going to say like it's interesting that
[04:26:41.200 --> 04:26:43.200]  the Rove beetles seem to be
[04:26:43.420 --> 04:26:45.420]  making a difference because the
[04:26:45.420 --> 04:26:47.420]  root aphids are you know they're primarily
[04:26:47.420 --> 04:26:49.420]  in the roots and aren't the Rove
[04:26:49.420 --> 04:26:51.420]  I don't know that much about Rove beetles I've never used
[04:26:51.420 --> 04:26:53.420]  them I'm not familiar are they
[04:26:53.420 --> 04:26:55.420]  soil also
[04:26:55.420 --> 04:26:57.420]  yeah so they would be like the same
[04:26:57.420 --> 04:26:59.420]  like H miles or
[04:26:59.420 --> 04:27:01.420]  straight lay laps
[04:27:01.420 --> 04:27:03.420]  depending on
[04:27:03.420 --> 04:27:05.420]  straightio lay laps right
[04:27:05.420 --> 04:27:07.420]  yeah
[04:27:07.420 --> 04:27:09.420]  we all know how to spell it
[04:27:09.420 --> 04:27:11.420]  none of us know how to pronounce these things
[04:27:11.640 --> 04:27:13.640]  I can spell it in Latin
[04:27:13.640 --> 04:27:15.640]  though
[04:27:15.640 --> 04:27:17.640]  yeah totally
[04:27:17.640 --> 04:27:19.640]  so Aphidilis comani did
[04:27:19.640 --> 04:27:21.640]  not do anything Aphidilis erpii
[04:27:21.640 --> 04:27:23.640]  did not do anything Aphelinus
[04:27:23.640 --> 04:27:25.640]  abdottalis did a
[04:27:25.640 --> 04:27:27.640]  little bit but again didn't really
[04:27:27.640 --> 04:27:29.640]  if it doesn't knock the numbers back
[04:27:29.640 --> 04:27:31.640]  then again
[04:27:31.640 --> 04:27:33.640]  I'm not going to do it
[04:27:33.640 --> 04:27:35.640]  I have a bunch of videos
[04:27:35.640 --> 04:27:37.640]  of lacewing larvae feeding on
[04:27:37.640 --> 04:27:39.640]  root aphids
[04:27:39.860 --> 04:27:41.860]  they don't necessarily
[04:27:41.860 --> 04:27:43.860]  knock the population back heavily but they do
[04:27:43.860 --> 04:27:45.860]  you know they will prefer to feed on them
[04:27:45.860 --> 04:27:47.860]  over other prey it seems like
[04:27:47.860 --> 04:27:49.860]  and the Rove beetles don't seem to screw
[04:27:49.860 --> 04:27:51.860]  with them all that much so you can use them
[04:27:51.860 --> 04:27:53.860]  in conjunction
[04:27:53.860 --> 04:27:55.860]  hold on I'm just going down my list to see if there's anything else
[04:27:55.860 --> 04:27:57.860]  hey Steve
[04:27:57.860 --> 04:27:59.860]  your lacewing larvae
[04:27:59.860 --> 04:28:01.860]  they were soil borne
[04:28:01.860 --> 04:28:03.860]  or are they just
[04:28:03.860 --> 04:28:05.860]  feeding on the adults
[04:28:05.860 --> 04:28:07.860]  when the adults emerge
[04:28:08.080 --> 04:28:10.080]  everything was in aquaponics
[04:28:10.080 --> 04:28:12.080]  so I can either
[04:28:12.080 --> 04:28:14.080]  just move the media aside
[04:28:14.080 --> 04:28:16.080]  or there are a bunch of things that are sitting above
[04:28:16.080 --> 04:28:18.080]  like a
[04:28:18.080 --> 04:28:20.080]  pot or a pot
[04:28:20.080 --> 04:28:22.080]  that has the roots going through the bottom
[04:28:22.080 --> 04:28:24.080]  to get into the media
[04:28:24.080 --> 04:28:26.080]  so there's always a way to observe
[04:28:26.080 --> 04:28:28.080]  at least to some extent
[04:28:28.080 --> 04:28:30.080]  yeah awesome that's cool
[04:28:30.080 --> 04:28:32.080]  I have a video on my instagram
[04:28:32.080 --> 04:28:34.080]  of them feeding
[04:28:34.080 --> 04:28:36.080]  trying to see if there's anything else
[04:28:36.300 --> 04:28:38.300]  orius insidious is another good one
[04:28:38.300 --> 04:28:40.300]  but again they don't really seem to go down to the roots
[04:28:40.300 --> 04:28:42.300]  they seem to focus much more on the upper part of the plant
[04:28:42.300 --> 04:28:44.300]  I don't find them much
[04:28:44.300 --> 04:28:46.300]  when I'm actually scouting down in the root zone
[04:28:46.300 --> 04:28:48.300]  very often
[04:28:48.300 --> 04:28:50.300]  so again they didn't really do much of anything
[04:28:50.300 --> 04:28:52.300]  in terms of population numbers
[04:28:52.300 --> 04:28:54.300]  so hopefully that helps you if you're running into that
[04:28:54.300 --> 04:28:58.660]  problem
[04:28:58.660 --> 04:29:00.660]  yeah I wish I knew about that about 6 months ago
[04:29:00.660 --> 04:29:02.660]  because I had a root aphid so bad
[04:29:02.660 --> 04:29:04.660]  that I actually had to reset my whole room
[04:29:04.660 --> 04:29:06.660]  I couldn't figure out a fix for them
[04:29:06.880 --> 04:29:08.880]  that's the one thing that's got the best of me
[04:29:08.880 --> 04:29:10.880]  yeah the
[04:29:10.880 --> 04:29:12.880]  I had one
[04:29:12.880 --> 04:29:14.880]  grower as well one time
[04:29:14.880 --> 04:29:16.880]  in Colorado I was doing
[04:29:16.880 --> 04:29:18.880]  working on a grow
[04:29:18.880 --> 04:29:20.880]  in fact I had brought some of the aphids with me
[04:29:20.880 --> 04:29:22.880]  to one of the regen conferences
[04:29:22.880 --> 04:29:24.880]  I think it was
[04:29:24.880 --> 04:29:26.880]  but there was a grow
[04:29:26.880 --> 04:29:28.880]  and they should have called me probably 3 months sooner
[04:29:28.880 --> 04:29:30.880]  but they had probably as much weight
[04:29:30.880 --> 04:29:32.880]  in aphids as they did plant mass
[04:29:32.880 --> 04:29:34.880]  in the greenhouse and then they're like what do we do
[04:29:35.100 --> 04:29:37.100]  burn everything
[04:29:37.100 --> 04:29:39.100]  there's more honeydew
[04:29:39.100 --> 04:29:41.100]  than there is resin on these plants
[04:29:41.100 --> 04:29:43.100]  you can't do anything
[04:29:47.100 --> 04:29:49.100]  yeah but
[04:29:49.100 --> 04:29:51.100]  what can you do
[04:29:51.100 --> 04:29:53.100]  all you do is save a couple put them in and document it
[04:29:53.100 --> 04:29:55.100]  take your pictures for examples
[04:29:55.100 --> 04:29:57.100]  and then clean it up
[04:30:00.500 --> 04:30:02.500]  you know what I'm not seeing this year
[04:30:02.500 --> 04:30:04.500]  that was a huge problem last year
[04:30:04.720 --> 04:30:06.720]  septoria outbreak was
[04:30:06.720 --> 04:30:08.720]  everywhere in Oklahoma
[04:30:08.720 --> 04:30:10.720]  and this year I'm not really seeing it that often
[04:30:10.720 --> 04:30:12.720]  especially on the hemp circles and the hemp forums
[04:30:12.720 --> 04:30:14.720]  I'm not seeing an outbreak like we did
[04:30:14.720 --> 04:30:16.720]  last year and I found that very interesting
[04:30:16.720 --> 04:30:18.720]  like
[04:30:18.720 --> 04:30:20.720]  just from an observational point where it was such a heavy
[04:30:20.720 --> 04:30:22.720]  problem last year and almost non-existent
[04:30:22.720 --> 04:30:24.720]  this year it seemed very strange I didn't know if anyone
[04:30:24.720 --> 04:30:26.720]  had any thoughts on that
[04:30:28.720 --> 04:30:30.720]  not entirely familiar with that
[04:30:30.720 --> 04:30:32.720]  it's like a rust
[04:30:32.940 --> 04:30:34.940]  we get that in Columbia too
[04:30:34.940 --> 04:30:36.940]  septoria it's nasty
[04:30:36.940 --> 04:30:38.940]  it affects a lot of crops
[04:30:38.940 --> 04:30:40.940]  and it's not always a problem but when it's a problem
[04:30:40.940 --> 04:30:42.940]  it runs quick
[04:30:42.940 --> 04:30:44.940]  and it's just
[04:30:44.940 --> 04:30:46.940]  talking leaves
[04:30:46.940 --> 04:30:48.940]  it'll shrivel up
[04:30:48.940 --> 04:30:50.940]  all the fan leaves until there's nothing left
[04:30:50.940 --> 04:30:52.940]  like the plant will de-toast
[04:30:52.940 --> 04:30:54.940]  if you have a bad
[04:30:54.940 --> 04:30:56.940]  keeping the bottoms clean is really crucial
[04:30:56.940 --> 04:30:58.940]  and if you have a
[04:30:58.940 --> 04:31:00.940]  living mulch ideally but any kind
[04:31:01.160 --> 04:31:03.160]  even a plastic mulch
[04:31:03.160 --> 04:31:05.160]  to keep the earth from splashing
[04:31:05.160 --> 04:31:07.160]  back up
[04:31:07.160 --> 04:31:09.160]  that's where it comes from
[04:31:09.160 --> 04:31:11.160]  it splashes up with the rain or irrigation
[04:31:11.160 --> 04:31:13.160]  it splashes up onto the bottom
[04:31:13.160 --> 04:31:15.160]  of the plant and once it gets onto the plant
[04:31:15.160 --> 04:31:17.160]  it'll just spread right across
[04:31:17.160 --> 04:31:19.160]  it and it's nasty
[04:31:19.160 --> 04:31:21.160]  oh yeah we had
[04:31:21.160 --> 04:31:23.160]  a pretty
[04:31:23.160 --> 04:31:25.160]  if you catch it early you can treat it but you have to treat it
[04:31:25.160 --> 04:31:27.160]  with just heavy probiotics
[04:31:27.160 --> 04:31:29.160]  you can absolutely treat it if you catch it early
[04:31:29.380 --> 04:31:31.380]  but I've seen two very distinct
[04:31:31.380 --> 04:31:33.380]  different versions one which
[04:31:33.380 --> 04:31:35.380]  causes a lot more heavy general
[04:31:35.380 --> 04:31:37.380]  chlorosis and another one
[04:31:37.380 --> 04:31:39.380]  has more of like a pin spotting almost
[04:31:39.380 --> 04:31:41.380]  starts off looking like
[04:31:41.380 --> 04:31:43.380]  the first time I did this
[04:31:43.380 --> 04:31:45.380]  myself the first time it happened I went and yelled
[04:31:45.380 --> 04:31:47.380]  at the guy who was watering because I thought
[04:31:47.380 --> 04:31:49.380]  for sure he had sprayed the bottom of the plant
[04:31:49.380 --> 04:31:51.380]  because it looked like where
[04:31:51.380 --> 04:31:53.380]  the person would spray
[04:31:53.380 --> 04:31:55.380]  that's where it starts
[04:31:55.380 --> 04:31:57.380]  is that exact spot on the plant
[04:31:57.600 --> 04:31:59.600]  you go and you scream at the person who's watering
[04:31:59.600 --> 04:32:01.600]  going yo dude look at what you did
[04:32:01.600 --> 04:32:03.600]  and you show them and then three days
[04:32:03.600 --> 04:32:05.600]  later it's halfway up the plant and you go
[04:32:05.600 --> 04:32:07.600]  oh I'm the idiot
[04:32:07.600 --> 04:32:09.600]  and then you suddenly
[04:32:09.600 --> 04:32:11.600]  realize that it's actually something else
[04:32:11.600 --> 04:32:13.600]  and then you have to immediately
[04:32:13.600 --> 04:32:15.600]  get in there and get on your rotation
[04:32:15.600 --> 04:32:17.600]  I found that hitting it pretty heavily with
[04:32:17.600 --> 04:32:19.600]  lactobacillus and then with
[04:32:19.600 --> 04:32:21.600]  the bactillus pumilus and a bactillus subtilis
[04:32:21.600 --> 04:32:23.600]  rotation for two weeks
[04:32:23.600 --> 04:32:25.600]  and then with a heavy IMO treatment
[04:32:25.820 --> 04:32:27.820]  a liquid IMO to get it back to kind of
[04:32:27.820 --> 04:32:29.820]  reset and
[04:32:29.820 --> 04:32:31.820]  out-compete it again seems to
[04:32:31.820 --> 04:32:33.820]  work pretty well we had
[04:32:33.820 --> 04:32:35.820]  very good luck at seven different locations last
[04:32:35.820 --> 04:32:37.820]  year at controlling it as long as
[04:32:37.820 --> 04:32:39.820]  we caught it early if once it got
[04:32:39.820 --> 04:32:41.820]  beyond a certain point that plant's toast
[04:32:41.820 --> 04:32:43.820]  you can't save it
[04:32:43.820 --> 04:32:45.820]  you gotta burn it off
[04:32:45.820 --> 04:32:47.820]  if you catch it really
[04:32:47.820 --> 04:32:49.820]  really early you can just do liquid IMO
[04:32:49.820 --> 04:32:51.820]  too we've seen a few that were
[04:32:51.820 --> 04:32:53.820]  just like they're like I'm noticing
[04:32:54.040 --> 04:32:56.040]  a leaf we're like ha liquid IMO
[04:32:56.040 --> 04:32:58.040]  as much as you can but I like the idea
[04:32:58.040 --> 04:33:00.040]  of using the labs first I think that's a smart
[04:33:00.040 --> 04:33:02.040]  way to knock it all the way back
[04:33:02.040 --> 04:33:04.040]  and then bring it back to health using
[04:33:04.040 --> 04:33:06.040]  your indigenous microorganisms that's cool
[04:33:06.040 --> 04:33:08.040]  I'm not seeing a lot of that this year at all though
[04:33:08.040 --> 04:33:10.040]  this year's the year
[04:33:10.040 --> 04:33:12.040]  of the hoplate and viroid I think
[04:33:12.040 --> 04:33:14.040]  last year was definitely septoria and
[04:33:14.040 --> 04:33:16.040]  aphids
[04:33:16.040 --> 04:33:18.040]  all these cycles right everybody
[04:33:18.040 --> 04:33:20.040]  seems to have the same thing at the same time
[04:33:20.040 --> 04:33:22.040]  but then the next year it's like oh yeah nobody really
[04:33:22.260 --> 04:33:24.260]  that's a hint towards the environment
[04:33:24.260 --> 04:33:26.260]  than the weather cycles
[04:33:26.260 --> 04:33:28.260]  that's right
[04:33:28.260 --> 04:33:30.260]  everything's
[04:33:30.260 --> 04:33:32.260]  comes up and down in cycles
[04:33:32.260 --> 04:33:34.260]  with the climate you're in right
[04:33:34.260 --> 04:33:36.260]  so the equator I got totally different
[04:33:36.260 --> 04:33:38.260]  problems than growing
[04:33:38.260 --> 04:33:40.260]  in North America you know it's totally
[04:33:40.260 --> 04:33:42.260]  different
[04:33:42.260 --> 04:33:44.260]  except for
[04:33:44.260 --> 04:33:46.260]  betrayal and rain you can get that
[04:33:46.260 --> 04:33:48.260]  either way
[04:33:48.260 --> 04:33:50.260]  we don't have the rain problem here
[04:33:50.480 --> 04:33:52.480]  we get
[04:33:52.480 --> 04:33:54.480]  we get mites out there
[04:33:54.480 --> 04:33:56.480]  which I never saw in my whole
[04:33:56.480 --> 04:33:58.480]  life in Canada we never ever had spider
[04:33:58.480 --> 04:34:00.480]  mites out doors it's just too cold
[04:34:00.480 --> 04:34:02.480]  everything freezes in the winter they're not
[04:34:02.480 --> 04:34:04.480]  a big thing but in Vancouver
[04:34:04.480 --> 04:34:06.480]  when I moved out there from Ontario
[04:34:06.480 --> 04:34:08.480]  then it became very apparent because it doesn't
[04:34:08.480 --> 04:34:10.480]  get that cold in Vancouver
[04:34:10.480 --> 04:34:12.480]  so the indoor places are under
[04:34:12.480 --> 04:34:14.480]  constant threat because the mites live
[04:34:14.480 --> 04:34:16.480]  in the hedges around every building
[04:34:16.480 --> 04:34:18.480]  you know and they're
[04:34:18.700 --> 04:34:20.700]  under constant threat but
[04:34:20.700 --> 04:34:22.700]  I never really see them as an outdoor
[04:34:22.700 --> 04:34:24.700]  problem I always thought the predators
[04:34:24.700 --> 04:34:26.700]  just kept them in check or what not but then
[04:34:26.700 --> 04:34:28.700]  in the dry season
[04:34:28.700 --> 04:34:30.700]  in the equator I've seen plants
[04:34:30.700 --> 04:34:32.700]  web outside where I just thought
[04:34:32.700 --> 04:34:34.700]  that was never possible because
[04:34:34.700 --> 04:34:36.700]  surely there'll be enough predators
[04:34:36.700 --> 04:34:38.700]  behind them no no the mites
[04:34:38.700 --> 04:34:40.700]  can just run rampant down there
[04:34:40.700 --> 04:34:42.700]  it's a frightening thing
[04:34:42.700 --> 04:34:44.700]  to see but I'm one of the
[04:34:44.700 --> 04:34:46.700]  rare ones like you sometimes
[04:34:46.920 --> 04:34:48.920]  you're happy to see like oh great
[04:34:48.920 --> 04:34:50.920]  we got the mites here let's see who likes this
[04:34:50.920 --> 04:34:52.920]  because it was during a selection crop
[04:34:52.920 --> 04:34:54.920]  and sure enough
[04:34:54.920 --> 04:34:56.920]  two of the lines
[04:34:56.920 --> 04:34:58.920]  practically were mite repellent
[04:34:58.920 --> 04:35:00.920]  you know they hated those plants
[04:35:00.920 --> 04:35:02.920]  they wouldn't touch them
[04:35:02.920 --> 04:35:04.920]  you know there was two lines of plants
[04:35:04.920 --> 04:35:06.920]  that they wouldn't touch out of
[04:35:06.920 --> 04:35:08.920]  I think there was maybe 21
[04:35:08.920 --> 04:35:10.920]  no 19
[04:35:10.920 --> 04:35:12.920]  they had 19 seed lines in that one
[04:35:12.920 --> 04:35:14.920]  test batch and
[04:35:15.140 --> 04:35:17.140]  two of them stood out
[04:35:17.140 --> 04:35:19.140]  as being mite repellent
[04:35:19.140 --> 04:35:21.140]  and somebody else was telling me
[04:35:21.140 --> 04:35:23.140]  that the terpenes that have been
[04:35:23.140 --> 04:35:25.140]  identified as repellent to mites
[04:35:25.140 --> 04:35:27.140]  and some plants have those
[04:35:27.140 --> 04:35:29.140]  I can't remember what the terpenes were
[04:35:29.140 --> 04:35:31.140]  they were semi-obscure
[04:35:31.140 --> 04:35:33.140]  kind of obscure
[04:35:33.140 --> 04:35:35.140]  oh man
[04:35:35.140 --> 04:35:37.140]  to see plants that they
[04:35:37.140 --> 04:35:39.140]  won't touch is just so
[04:35:39.140 --> 04:35:41.140]  heartening you know it's worth sacrificing
[04:35:41.140 --> 04:35:43.140]  other ones
[04:35:43.360 --> 04:35:45.360]  you know you find those
[04:35:45.360 --> 04:35:47.360]  where you're like wow
[04:35:47.360 --> 04:35:49.360]  sure we don't all want to have the same two flavors
[04:35:49.360 --> 04:35:51.360]  of weed that mites hate
[04:35:51.360 --> 04:35:53.360]  they always go for the tastiest
[04:35:53.360 --> 04:35:55.360]  ones first I find
[04:35:55.360 --> 04:35:57.360]  like the ones that have the most
[04:35:57.360 --> 04:35:59.360]  fruity and candied aromas
[04:35:59.360 --> 04:36:01.360]  the mites will pick them out first
[04:36:01.360 --> 04:36:03.360]  and the ones that have
[04:36:03.360 --> 04:36:05.360]  a real pungent
[04:36:05.360 --> 04:36:07.360]  like cleaner kind of aromas
[04:36:07.360 --> 04:36:09.360]  you know
[04:36:09.360 --> 04:36:11.360]  they're not quite to their taste
[04:36:11.580 --> 04:36:13.580]  they really do go for the fruitier ones
[04:36:13.580 --> 04:36:15.580]  so sometimes even in sweet pea
[04:36:15.580 --> 04:36:17.580]  selection land I can remember
[04:36:17.580 --> 04:36:19.580]  going after
[04:36:19.580 --> 04:36:21.580]  the first ones the mites
[04:36:21.580 --> 04:36:23.580]  and say man they really
[04:36:23.580 --> 04:36:25.580]  know the sweet ones like they always
[04:36:25.580 --> 04:36:27.580]  go for the best plant
[04:36:27.580 --> 04:36:29.580]  they have a
[04:36:29.580 --> 04:36:31.580]  they're instinctively drawn to the
[04:36:31.580 --> 04:36:33.580]  tastiest plant of the bunch
[04:36:33.580 --> 04:36:35.580]  so it's kind of funny to watch them that
[04:36:35.580 --> 04:36:37.580]  way but they do have a certain taste
[04:36:37.580 --> 04:36:39.580]  so the plants that the mites
[04:36:39.800 --> 04:36:41.800]  didn't like they were
[04:36:41.800 --> 04:36:43.800]  you know perfectly respectable
[04:36:43.800 --> 04:36:45.800]  flavor wise and they were strong
[04:36:45.800 --> 04:36:47.800]  plants too they had
[04:36:47.800 --> 04:36:49.800]  both of them had over
[04:36:49.800 --> 04:36:51.800]  30 over 31 actually
[04:36:51.800 --> 04:36:53.800]  both of those in THC
[04:36:53.800 --> 04:36:55.800]  but it's probably nothing to do
[04:36:55.800 --> 04:36:57.800]  with the THC and everything to do
[04:36:57.800 --> 04:36:59.800]  with whatever unusual
[04:36:59.800 --> 04:37:01.800]  terpenes those ones had
[04:37:01.800 --> 04:37:03.800]  it's worth
[04:37:03.800 --> 04:37:05.800]  further study that's for sure
[04:37:05.800 --> 04:37:07.800]  well that's where the breeding
[04:37:08.020 --> 04:37:10.020]  that's where breeding comes in right
[04:37:10.020 --> 04:37:12.020]  you take those two that were the mite
[04:37:12.020 --> 04:37:14.020]  resistance and you keep going until you find
[04:37:14.020 --> 04:37:16.020]  the ones that have the flavor and the smell
[04:37:16.020 --> 04:37:18.020]  that you like and hopefully you can breed
[04:37:18.020 --> 04:37:20.020]  that resistance into it too
[04:37:20.020 --> 04:37:22.020]  I've tried that a long time
[04:37:22.020 --> 04:37:24.020]  and it always
[04:37:24.020 --> 04:37:26.020]  didn't go
[04:37:26.020 --> 04:37:28.020]  maybe we can
[04:37:28.020 --> 04:37:30.020]  bring up the mite repellent
[04:37:30.020 --> 04:37:32.020]  enough that you can still
[04:37:32.020 --> 04:37:34.020]  have sweet and you know think of it
[04:37:34.020 --> 04:37:36.020]  like muskel like you think how strong
[04:37:36.240 --> 04:37:38.240]  mosquito repellent is
[04:37:38.240 --> 04:37:40.240]  you can have pungent grass like that
[04:37:40.240 --> 04:37:42.240]  it's not Chanel number 5
[04:37:42.240 --> 04:37:44.240]  and it may get to Boston
[04:37:44.240 --> 04:37:46.240]  but it smells like muskel
[04:37:46.240 --> 04:37:48.240]  right
[04:37:48.240 --> 04:37:50.240]  the plants with the mites
[04:37:50.240 --> 04:37:52.240]  you can have a plant
[04:37:52.240 --> 04:37:54.240]  that repels mites but sure
[04:37:54.240 --> 04:37:56.240]  it's not the candy no matter what
[04:37:56.240 --> 04:37:58.240]  you might mix a little candy in there
[04:37:58.240 --> 04:38:00.240]  but that doesn't make it candy anymore
[04:38:00.240 --> 04:38:02.240]  right now it's just
[04:38:02.240 --> 04:38:04.240]  flavored muskel
[04:38:04.460 --> 04:38:06.460]  right
[04:38:06.460 --> 04:38:08.460]  yeah those
[04:38:08.460 --> 04:38:10.460]  particular terpenes are just
[04:38:10.460 --> 04:38:12.460]  more
[04:38:12.460 --> 04:38:14.460]  for a generalist term they're just more
[04:38:14.460 --> 04:38:16.460]  anti-parasitic they're just more
[04:38:16.460 --> 04:38:18.460]  anti they're more repellent
[04:38:18.460 --> 04:38:20.460]  just by nature so when we're
[04:38:20.460 --> 04:38:22.460]  selecting for those sweeter terpenes
[04:38:22.460 --> 04:38:24.460]  we're actually selecting away from
[04:38:24.460 --> 04:38:26.460]  the pest
[04:38:26.460 --> 04:38:28.460]  resilience
[04:38:28.460 --> 04:38:30.460]  yeah the repellent
[04:38:30.460 --> 04:38:32.460]  you can maximize it too
[04:38:32.680 --> 04:38:34.680]  you can maximize your terpenes
[04:38:34.680 --> 04:38:36.680]  just by maximizing the biodiversity of your soil
[04:38:36.680 --> 04:38:38.680]  be it through living soil
[04:38:38.680 --> 04:38:40.680]  or if you want to go crazy and do what I do with aquaponics
[04:38:40.680 --> 04:38:42.680]  I think
[04:38:42.680 --> 04:38:44.680]  Breeder Steve is also working on that too
[04:38:44.680 --> 04:38:46.680]  down there in Columbia
[04:38:46.680 --> 04:38:48.680]  with some cool stuff
[04:38:48.680 --> 04:38:50.680]  but it doesn't matter how you're
[04:38:50.680 --> 04:38:52.680]  trying to increase your biodiversity
[04:38:52.680 --> 04:38:54.680]  but increasing biodiversity in general
[04:38:54.680 --> 04:38:56.680]  is going to mean that you're stimulating that plant's immune system
[04:38:56.680 --> 04:38:58.680]  and other things that are going to again
[04:38:58.680 --> 04:39:00.680]  further increase that terpene's
[04:39:00.900 --> 04:39:02.900]  production because at the basic level
[04:39:02.900 --> 04:39:04.900]  terpenes are just means for the plant to defend
[04:39:04.900 --> 04:39:06.900]  or protect itself or otherwise deal with
[04:39:06.900 --> 04:39:08.900]  the environment in some form
[04:39:08.900 --> 04:39:10.900]  and the more ways that you can stimulate
[04:39:10.900 --> 04:39:12.900]  those points without
[04:39:12.900 --> 04:39:14.900]  that being a pathogenic way
[04:39:14.900 --> 04:39:16.900]  the better tasting
[04:39:16.900 --> 04:39:18.900]  your cannabis is going to be regardless of the method
[04:39:20.900 --> 04:39:22.900]  Steve with all that information
[04:39:22.900 --> 04:39:24.900]  God I don't know how it all fits in that head of yours
[04:39:24.900 --> 04:39:26.900]  you're so awesome
[04:39:26.900 --> 04:39:28.900]  thanks for dropping all the bombs today
[04:39:29.120 --> 04:39:31.120]  it was awesome spending time with you
[04:39:31.120 --> 04:39:33.120]  and seeing you again
[04:39:33.120 --> 04:39:35.120]  Breeder Steve
[04:39:35.120 --> 04:39:37.120]  when that border opens up
[04:39:37.120 --> 04:39:39.120]  I've been wanting to come up and see you
[04:39:39.120 --> 04:39:41.120]  I know we've been talking about it for a while
[04:39:41.120 --> 04:39:43.120]  but thanks again Peter
[04:39:43.120 --> 04:39:45.120]  for inviting me on
[04:39:45.120 --> 04:39:47.120]  and Wendy we're going to be putting on a panel
[04:39:47.120 --> 04:39:49.120]  and everybody I guess Peter's invited us
[04:39:49.120 --> 04:39:51.120]  we're going to be doing some stuff
[04:39:51.120 --> 04:39:53.120]  so thanks again Peter
[04:39:53.120 --> 04:39:55.120]  have a fantastic night you all
[04:39:55.120 --> 04:39:57.120]  thanks for all the information
[04:39:57.340 --> 04:39:59.340]  thanks everybody
[04:39:59.340 --> 04:40:01.340]  why don't we end on that
[04:40:01.340 --> 04:40:03.340]  because I've got
[04:40:03.340 --> 04:40:05.340]  kids to feed dinner
[04:40:05.340 --> 04:40:07.340]  and a bed to climb into
[04:40:07.340 --> 04:40:09.340]  and a bed to climb into
[04:40:09.340 --> 04:40:11.340]  so Steve
[04:40:11.340 --> 04:40:13.340]  you win the award
[04:40:13.340 --> 04:40:15.340]  for most comfortable
[04:40:15.340 --> 04:40:17.340]  panelists tonight
[04:40:17.340 --> 04:40:19.340]  so we'll be
[04:40:19.340 --> 04:40:21.340]  sending your jet ski
[04:40:21.340 --> 04:40:23.340]  shortly
[04:40:23.340 --> 04:40:25.340]  thanks for hanging out
[04:40:25.560 --> 04:40:27.560]  thanks for hanging out Steve
[04:40:27.560 --> 04:40:29.560]  it was a pleasure to meet you man
[04:40:29.560 --> 04:40:31.560]  hey man thanks for having me guys
[04:40:31.560 --> 04:40:33.560]  this is an interesting afternoon
[04:40:33.560 --> 04:40:35.560]  shooting the breeze with you all
[04:40:35.560 --> 04:40:37.560]  so lots of fun
[04:40:37.560 --> 04:40:39.560]  and I hope everybody's crop turns out alright
[04:40:39.560 --> 04:40:41.560]  or better than alright
[04:40:41.560 --> 04:40:43.560]  and here comes
[04:40:43.560 --> 04:40:45.560]  Gemma

[04:40:47.560 --> 04:40:49.560]  and with that let's kill the
[04:40:49.560 --> 04:40:51.560]  YouTube stream
[04:40:51.560 --> 04:40:53.560]  or you can just be quiet
[04:40:53.780 --> 04:40:55.780]  just wave to the camera
[04:40:55.780 --> 04:40:57.780]  Gemma has said
[04:40:57.780 --> 04:40:59.780]  we'll kill the live stream
