[00:00.000 --> 00:08.160]  All right, we're we're gonna wing it so Josh and Kelly get on but good morning boys and girls we were
[00:09.160 --> 00:13.700]  we're just getting our morning sports talk in since Leighton is wearing a
[00:14.880 --> 00:20.040]  Can you show yes there we go the Boston shirt the hometown and I was saying I you know
[00:20.040 --> 00:22.040]  I live in LA and I was watching
[00:22.080 --> 00:26.200]  the Bruins Canadians last night with my daughter Gemma, which is a
[00:27.160 --> 00:34.640]  The the biggest hockey rivalry for the Bruins and then I was saying that I am doing my best to make sure that
[00:34.640 --> 00:37.760]  none of my three daughters are Lakers fans because
[00:38.560 --> 00:42.320]  if you're a Celtics fan, the the one team you hate is the Lakers and
[00:43.400 --> 00:47.600]  if you're a Red Sox fan, the one team you hate is the Yankees, so
[00:48.840 --> 00:50.840]  Anywho, and then we were talking about
[00:53.480 --> 00:55.480]  Talking about a be mess
[00:56.680 --> 01:01.120]  But Buffalo now I like Buffalo because I like small markets and
[01:02.520 --> 01:09.680]  I always felt bad for the bills in the late 80s when they had the forest rate Super Bowl losses
[01:10.680 --> 01:15.440]  So that was the Jim Kelly, but but this weekend. I don't want the bills to win. So
[01:16.520 --> 01:17.960]  but
[01:17.960 --> 01:22.380]  Other than that, I could care less but Buffalo doesn't have much going for it. So
[01:23.300 --> 01:25.300]  Other than their wings, right?
[01:25.500 --> 01:27.500]  right
[01:27.540 --> 01:33.500]  Other than right other than a global recognition of the fantastic
[01:34.580 --> 01:39.520]  wings that may or may not be named after the the city or or the
[01:40.060 --> 01:43.160]  The Bison fan what's a Buffalo and in the Bison?
[01:44.180 --> 01:50.580]  Family or but our Buffalo and Bison. I think Buffalo's the miscorrect term. It's Bison
[01:53.260 --> 01:58.820]  When I worked for a company called Buffalo all these people used to tell us that it should be Bison low
[01:59.260 --> 02:01.260]  Buffalo's the incorrect term
[02:02.100 --> 02:05.140]  Actually, so I think both are correct
[02:07.060 --> 02:13.940]  Bison including the American Buffalo Bison are large even toed ungulates and the genus Bison
[02:16.140 --> 02:20.950]  I
[02:20.950 --> 02:23.990]  Know is this shit is fantastic. Although colloquially
[02:25.150 --> 02:30.670]  Colloquially referred to as a Buffalo in the United States and Canada. It is only distantly related to the true Buffalo
[02:30.670 --> 02:32.670]  So there is a true Buffalo
[02:33.510 --> 02:36.070]  I don't know where the true Buffalo is
[02:39.230 --> 02:42.010]  Where is a true but all right true Buffalo, oh wow
[02:44.350 --> 02:47.110]  Yeah, true Buffalo looks like it's an African
[02:47.990 --> 02:49.430]  Sahara
[02:49.430 --> 02:55.190]  currently Buffalo's can be found naturally in sub-saharan Africa South Asia and Southeast Asia and
[02:56.110 --> 03:03.070]  Domestic and feral populations have been introduced to Europe the Americas in Australia. So this actually gets to a random topic
[03:03.070 --> 03:05.070]  I was thinking about this morning, which is
[03:05.510 --> 03:10.750]  in the brassica family, there are many many many plants and
[03:13.470 --> 03:18.030]  So like cauliflower is a brassica correct and broccoli and
[03:19.590 --> 03:21.590]  Mustard greens obviously
[03:23.430 --> 03:25.430]  Arugula is a brassica
[03:27.910 --> 03:29.910]  What else Layton
[03:35.910 --> 03:43.270]  Chat kale, right. Oh, yeah, so I yeah, so so ah brassica don't utilize mycorrhizal
[03:45.110 --> 03:47.110]  So does that mean that they like
[03:47.270 --> 03:49.270]  So does that mean that they like
[03:52.270 --> 04:00.870]  They like very bacterial rich oils that that's yeah radishes in the brassica I believe so
[04:03.390 --> 04:09.230]  So where I'm going with this is, you know, cuz I grow most things out to seed and
[04:09.990 --> 04:11.990]  I'm always like
[04:12.270 --> 04:14.270]  Worried of like if I grow
[04:15.030 --> 04:21.630]  You know like how far apart you need to be in the brassica family where they won't cross pollinate
[04:21.630 --> 04:23.630]  so like a radish and a
[04:24.510 --> 04:26.830]  Cauliflower, I assume would not cross pollinate
[04:27.870 --> 04:29.870]  Although I may be totally wrong with that
[04:31.710 --> 04:35.470]  Well, because I grow stuff out to seed and then I
[04:36.070 --> 04:41.630]  Send seeds like when people order cannabis seeds. I also send out like my growing
[04:42.630 --> 04:44.630]  Lineup of vegetable seeds
[04:46.590 --> 04:50.990]  For companion plants just for whatever for anything for
[04:52.070 --> 04:58.390]  Like I didn't order this green cauliflower seed, but I'll grow it and I'll eat it or I'll
[04:59.910 --> 05:06.270]  Yeah, whatever yeah, I mean I have some stuff that like I have actually down here I have hairy vetch
[05:06.270 --> 05:08.390]  I have Austrian peas. I have
[05:09.310 --> 05:11.310]  nasturtium I have
[05:11.630 --> 05:13.910]  This is all stuff. I'm sprouting right now. I have a
[05:15.070 --> 05:17.070]  specific
[05:18.310 --> 05:25.110]  Tobacco varietal so like right now the only tobacco I grew out so far was super high in nicotine
[05:25.110 --> 05:28.670]  So I figure people would appreciate something a little less
[05:30.230 --> 05:32.710]  Aggressive on the nicotine front I
[05:35.190 --> 05:37.190]  Have this is
[05:37.630 --> 05:39.630]  Shiso, which I've already done a run of
[05:40.630 --> 05:43.190]  Romanesco is the next
[05:44.310 --> 05:47.350]  Kind of broccoli cauliflower, and then I have broccoli Rob
[05:47.350 --> 05:51.670]  Oh, so that that would be an example like I have Romanesco that I'm gonna grow at my house
[05:52.350 --> 05:56.790]  but then at Tom's house, I'm gonna grow the broccoli Rob because
[05:57.430 --> 06:00.590]  I'm like I don't really want that. I don't want to have like a
[06:01.910 --> 06:07.270]  mutt of like a beautiful Romanesco and the
[06:08.230 --> 06:12.470]  Broccoli Rob so that's where I'm like would they cross pollinate?
[06:14.990 --> 06:17.550]  Anyway these are the things I've been thinking about
[06:19.950 --> 06:26.310]  Little side projects you got going on. It's it's yeah, I don't know it's fun though
[06:29.630 --> 06:31.030]  Okay
[06:31.030 --> 06:36.270]  Sorry, I'm just so for our community. We're just waiting for Dempier to get on
[06:36.270 --> 06:42.430]  We're just kind of chatting it up and yeah, I'll rob it for you guys and you know, give a shout out to greens
[06:43.070 --> 06:47.550]  Good to see you back. Prince got us and she's talking about a paper that's been
[06:48.270 --> 06:53.630]  Started to be publicized or widely spread around about the effects of THC a
[06:54.950 --> 06:58.390]  CBD a and CZ GA which is
[06:58.390 --> 07:00.390]  Obviously in the
[07:00.830 --> 07:06.190]  So it's not gonna get you high but it has some anti viral effects
[07:06.710 --> 07:11.310]  That were published out of Oregon and I think there's some older pages
[07:11.790 --> 07:15.590]  older papers as well that discuss the health benefits of
[07:16.150 --> 07:18.150]  these on
[07:19.270 --> 07:21.270]  Or acid forms of
[07:21.950 --> 07:23.470]  cannabinoids
[07:23.470 --> 07:25.590]  and you know, it's it's ironic that
[07:26.590 --> 07:30.350]  We just discussed that I think it was two weeks ago we were talking about
[07:31.190 --> 07:33.190]  the use of THC a
[07:33.270 --> 07:35.070]  as a
[07:35.070 --> 07:37.070]  ingredient in
[07:37.150 --> 07:38.630]  cannabis
[07:38.630 --> 07:44.590]  How I say this medicines Napoleon was using that for years using THC crystals
[07:45.110 --> 07:48.350]  in that in her routine of making
[07:49.350 --> 07:55.470]  You know tablets for either consumption or obviously for suppository if necessary
[07:55.710 --> 08:03.390]  But it's it's just interesting that now finally these kinds of papers are coming out saying hey, there's this incredible benefits of these plants
[08:04.190 --> 08:10.150]  As long as you you know, you can smoke them sure and you'll get an effect that way but also just in a in a straight
[08:10.150 --> 08:15.070]  Form and remember we were talking about juicing with Kevin. Yeah, and you sing is
[08:15.510 --> 08:18.670]  That's that's where it's at. Yeah, it is big time
[08:19.310 --> 08:22.830]  Yeah, I actually reached out to the Oregon
[08:23.310 --> 08:28.910]  State researcher who who published that to see if he wants to come give a presentation. So
[08:29.430 --> 08:31.150]  I'm waiting to hear back from him
[08:31.150 --> 08:38.990]  but I remember like a year ago or so there were two Canadian researchers that I had present
[08:39.390 --> 08:41.390]  their coven
[08:41.710 --> 08:43.710]  coven cannabis gin and juice
[08:45.590 --> 08:49.110]  So their their research on coven and cannabis I
[08:50.430 --> 08:52.430]  Think a lot of the parents out there
[08:53.430 --> 08:55.430]  misinformed on what THC a is
[08:55.430 --> 09:01.350]  So that would be great. Maybe we could talk about that at some point as well late and with with a guest that's super knowledgeable
[09:01.990 --> 09:03.990]  Because that is a game changer
[09:04.190 --> 09:10.950]  And of course CBD is a game changer for children that have are having seizures. I've personally gone through that myself
[09:10.990 --> 09:18.430]  So the education needs to be there so that people understand that that and for whatever reason the endocannabinoid system seems to be
[09:19.150 --> 09:23.270]  diminished or low with children that have seizures and there's
[09:23.990 --> 09:28.270]  Obviously way more information that needs to be done about that. I kind of see
[09:28.870 --> 09:34.010]  That's why the the topicals that you can rub on the child's foot when they're having seizures work
[09:34.110 --> 09:40.190]  Apparently it's transdermal and apparently it goes through I don't know late and if you can kind of talk more on that kind of stuff
[09:40.190 --> 09:42.190]  But THC a with that CBD
[09:42.870 --> 09:46.070]  Seems to be the magic potion for that
[09:46.670 --> 09:48.390]  Well again, that's why you know
[09:48.390 --> 09:54.990]  I asked down pure to come on because they've done a lot of work over the years in discussing or in
[09:55.230 --> 09:57.470]  working with different types and forms of
[09:58.510 --> 10:00.750]  plants as well as combination with
[10:03.750 --> 10:07.310]  So looking forward to having them and hang with us here gang, I'm sorry
[10:07.390 --> 10:11.470]  They're up in Canada and the weather gets crazy and they have difficult time
[10:12.070 --> 10:15.030]  Getting their internet connection working. So I'm sure they'll be here shortly
[10:15.030 --> 10:18.590]  We just have to bear with them because they'll probably cut in and out as
[10:19.270 --> 10:22.450]  Typically happens when we have them on our show or shows
[10:23.590 --> 10:30.430]  But anyway, yeah that the the foot is an interesting thing. And you know, this was something that I never got to talk about
[10:31.030 --> 10:33.270]  on the tribute to Pauline which was
[10:33.750 --> 10:36.390]  The work that she did when you first met her
[10:36.750 --> 10:38.750]  as a client
[10:39.190 --> 10:41.190]  she would grab your foot and
[10:41.710 --> 10:49.070]  She would just start rubbing it in different places and then she would just talk to you about all these things like your ailments
[10:50.350 --> 10:52.150]  you know, perhaps
[10:52.150 --> 10:55.310]  feelings that you had or she could almost like
[10:55.990 --> 11:01.830]  Almost like tea leave reading or or tarot card reading just by touching your foot
[11:01.830 --> 11:05.310]  She could tell you shit trauma that happened in your past. I mean it was nuts
[11:05.310 --> 11:11.590]  It was it was almost scary the way she did it, but it goes to show you that the foot
[11:12.470 --> 11:16.550]  Obviously is where a lot of toxins are released out of your body
[11:16.550 --> 11:22.470]  But also it is definitely a main connector to the overall body as a whole
[11:22.870 --> 11:27.670]  So, you know when we talk about grounding and this gets a little woo-woo about walking around barefoot
[11:28.430 --> 11:32.230]  There's definitely some you know health benefits to that
[11:32.910 --> 11:37.830]  Exchange of ions or transfer of energy from the earth into the human body
[11:37.830 --> 11:41.990]  And then obviously it also gives you a place to excrete out
[11:42.590 --> 11:43.990]  poisons or
[11:43.990 --> 11:49.510]  Toxins that that are built up in your body. So the feet are really an interesting thing and you know
[11:49.510 --> 11:51.510]  I wish I'd brought that up last time
[11:51.590 --> 11:55.470]  when we're talking about Pauline and the work that she did but
[11:56.110 --> 12:01.350]  Yeah, that was that was always really interesting to me, you know, especially when being around her
[12:01.350 --> 12:06.150]  I got to meet, you know, some of her new clients and when she did this these people they were just like, you know
[12:06.150 --> 12:12.630]  Well, what was that all about right? It's pretty trippy that someone can grab your foot and just start telling you
[12:13.230 --> 12:15.990]  All of your ailments and even some of your past
[12:17.190 --> 12:21.910]  It was interesting. I don't know where I was going with that. Oh, we're talking about how rubbing
[12:22.470 --> 12:27.890]  those oils on a foot of a person in a seizure helps to relieve the
[12:28.670 --> 12:30.670]  receipt the side effects of the seizure
[12:31.350 --> 12:35.870]  So yeah, it's interesting. The body is very interesting. She was a
[12:37.190 --> 12:39.190]  true
[12:39.870 --> 12:46.230]  Colleague of studying and understanding how the body works everything from pressure points chakras
[12:46.910 --> 12:50.950]  She dove down the work of acupuncture, which is another interesting
[12:52.350 --> 12:55.150]  Say a misunderstood art in healing
[12:56.190 --> 13:00.030]  Yeah, it's weird how it varies from state to state where some states view it as
[13:00.870 --> 13:05.030]  You know you had to basically be licensed to do it and then in other states it's just
[13:05.590 --> 13:11.010]  You might as well call yourself a life coach or something, you know, it takes zero credentials to do it
[13:11.670 --> 13:17.750]  But acupuncture I've enjoyed that in my life. I want to get more back into yoga certain things that I feel
[13:19.270 --> 13:21.670]  Maybe kind of made fun of when I was younger
[13:21.670 --> 13:26.470]  my mother's been a yoga instructor for most of my adult life and I always kind of
[13:27.470 --> 13:31.710]  Not merely made fun of it just thought it was kind of silly for for men to do
[13:32.230 --> 13:37.410]  But then I was able to to go to a gym that had fantastic instructors
[13:37.830 --> 13:44.930]  There and I started going just after working out and I was amazed at not the overall strength of everyone in the class
[13:45.510 --> 13:50.670]  But it seemed like the health of the individuals themselves if they went like a couple times a week
[13:50.670 --> 13:55.350]  All of those individuals male and female you could tell we're in fantastic shape
[13:55.830 --> 13:57.830]  So I think there's something to
[13:58.510 --> 14:02.510]  Connecting the mind body and then just the physical aspects of working
[14:04.350 --> 14:06.350]  What's up, dude
[14:06.350 --> 14:08.950]  You see the belly button? Yeah
[14:10.470 --> 14:14.870]  There's a there's a lot of stuff. I feel like that's misinformed with people outside of
[14:15.670 --> 14:20.390]  That have children with these ailments outside of states that even really educate on
[14:20.790 --> 14:23.750]  Cannabis because if you go to the doctor for a lot of this stuff, they are
[14:24.630 --> 14:26.590]  Automatically against it
[14:26.590 --> 14:30.430]  They say that there's no reason to get children high and that's why I meant by THC a
[14:31.150 --> 14:33.150]  Even the doctors are misinformed
[14:34.150 --> 14:38.110]  And I'm not saying they're doing it maliciously. It's just they're just misinformed on
[14:38.830 --> 14:44.230]  What the cannabinoids are or the fact that a plant I guess is necessarily medicine
[14:44.350 --> 14:46.350]  it seems like for most of the
[14:46.510 --> 14:48.510]  the MDs that are
[14:48.910 --> 14:53.630]  Anti-cannabis, there's just no medicinal benefit in their eyes whatsoever
[14:54.230 --> 14:59.430]  Well, remember they don't even understand that we have a system called the end of cannabinoids
[15:00.150 --> 15:04.710]  That's not taught in medical school. So, you know and and the same with our biology
[15:05.030 --> 15:09.030]  You know the the Eastern medicine is always shit on the Western medicines
[15:09.550 --> 15:11.550]  philosophy of using plants instead of
[15:11.950 --> 15:14.710]  Pharmaceutical drugs. What does that tell you? Right?
[15:15.470 --> 15:21.350]  So the remember pharmaceutical industry is what took over the medical schools
[15:22.150 --> 15:24.150]  in the late
[15:24.150 --> 15:29.190]  1920s or early 30s, I believe is when it happened about the same time they abolished hemp
[15:29.830 --> 15:31.990]  And that's when we all started to get sick
[15:32.630 --> 15:34.830]  Because the animals that we eat no longer
[15:35.350 --> 15:41.110]  Use or are allowed to eat hemp as a protein source or a main staple in their diet
[15:41.990 --> 15:43.990]  So, yeah our
[15:44.190 --> 15:48.150]  Medical industry as a whole is you know a fucking joke to say the least
[15:48.150 --> 15:53.270]  I mean the fact that we still treat cancer with what we learned 50 fucking years ago and
[15:53.670 --> 15:58.110]  That is to just nuke the body and hopefully the patient survives it
[15:58.630 --> 16:00.630]  No kind of fucking
[16:01.910 --> 16:08.270]  Witchcraft is that you know, it's like no let's put a leech on me because I got you know a fucking headache
[16:08.670 --> 16:14.110]  You know you would think that the medical industry as a whole would have evolved similar to the way
[16:15.390 --> 16:19.030]  The other industries like electronics. Hey guys
[16:19.950 --> 16:21.950]  Good to see you
[16:24.950 --> 16:32.550]  We have incredible weather here and we were trying to get on and it kept kicking us off but good morning everyone
[16:33.550 --> 16:35.550]  So lovely
[16:36.390 --> 16:38.390]  Fallen
[16:41.110 --> 16:45.230]  So before you guys came on we were kind of just talking about cannabis as medicine
[16:45.230 --> 16:48.190]  So this is kind of nice for you guys to pop on right when you did
[16:48.190 --> 16:53.630]  I know Layton wanted to kind of talk about Pauline and cannabis as medicine with you guys. So
[16:54.150 --> 16:58.630]  It's perfect time. I must kind of get into that lane. Yeah, and it's not just cannabis
[16:58.630 --> 17:01.550]  it's the mushrooms that are chemicals that you guys make and so
[17:02.550 --> 17:08.990]  Way back when when Pauline was first diagnosed with cancer and went down the rabbit hole trying to research
[17:09.350 --> 17:13.910]  Alternative or natural methods for for treating it and keeping it at bay
[17:13.910 --> 17:17.510]  One of the things she did was she got some dragonflies can account
[17:18.110 --> 17:20.830]  My coat my coat canna I think is what you call them
[17:22.750 --> 17:24.070]  Anyway, she
[17:24.070 --> 17:29.550]  She sent these pills off to Greece which does this specific type of test?
[17:29.990 --> 17:33.830]  Called the Karis test and this is we were talking about the medical industry and what a
[17:35.390 --> 17:39.470]  Ridiculous system we have at this point in here in the Western world
[17:40.230 --> 17:46.190]  where they don't even know none of these doctors ever heard of what the Karis test is and what it is is a way to
[17:47.710 --> 17:51.430]  Use different products whether they're herbal or pharmaceutical
[17:52.150 --> 17:56.990]  and put them directly in contact with the cancer in the patient's blood and
[17:57.430 --> 18:00.990]  Then watch the percentage or reaction of what happens
[18:01.310 --> 18:06.990]  So the idea is just to cause a pop toast is where the cell just basically implodes disintegrates
[18:08.030 --> 18:11.230]  so it's killing of the cancer cell and so
[18:11.750 --> 18:15.550]  Pauline sent some of the the caplets that you guys had produced off to
[18:15.950 --> 18:22.230]  Greece and had the Karis test performed on her blood and yes, it did actually cause a pop toast
[18:22.910 --> 18:24.910]  at a pretty high percentage so
[18:25.390 --> 18:29.030]  Typically an herb or a plant will only
[18:29.910 --> 18:34.350]  cause the percentage or the percentage of death to the cells is
[18:34.950 --> 18:39.990]  Relatively low and I believe the caps were like 17% which is very high
[18:40.910 --> 18:46.830]  As far as a natural method in in if you were going to compare it against say chemotherapy
[18:47.630 --> 18:49.630]  Chemotherapy is like 80%
[18:50.510 --> 18:57.750]  Positive and killing the cancer cells, but remember it's killing all of the cells. It's killing all kinds of important cells
[18:58.390 --> 19:00.390]  so
[19:01.150 --> 19:03.150]  Excuse me it opens you up to
[19:03.310 --> 19:07.790]  All kinds of other problems that occur when you you've nuked your body
[19:08.270 --> 19:11.070]  So the cannabis that we sent off
[19:12.150 --> 19:13.790]  the the oil
[19:13.790 --> 19:15.790]  Was I think 21?
[19:16.150 --> 19:19.270]  And then all of the other herbs were down in
[19:19.630 --> 19:22.990]  Either single digits or low teens as far as how well they work
[19:23.150 --> 19:30.110]  but again, it's it's the combination of all of these things that are really producing the overall benefits and
[19:31.150 --> 19:33.630]  remember last two weeks ago, we did the
[19:34.230 --> 19:36.230]  tribute to Pauline we talked about
[19:37.230 --> 19:39.230]  how she was able to
[19:39.990 --> 19:46.270]  Keep the cancer at bay for two years now remember for the audience who doesn't understand this
[19:47.950 --> 19:50.510]  Anytime you are diagnosed with a
[19:52.190 --> 19:54.190]  Cancer
[19:54.430 --> 19:58.310]  That is that aggressive I forget it's a theory or something
[20:00.630 --> 20:04.470]  But anyway, it is probably the fastest growing cancer
[20:05.270 --> 20:10.670]  And and to be diagnosed with stage 4 ovarian is is essentially a death sentence
[20:12.630 --> 20:14.710]  Less than 1% will ever
[20:15.430 --> 20:22.950]  Survive that and have any quality of life after being diagnosed and especially if they've as many organs
[20:23.590 --> 20:27.550]  Removed as Pauline in her her case or her scenario
[20:27.550 --> 20:31.190]  I think there was eight organs that they were in a lot of parts and pieces
[20:31.190 --> 20:38.350]  So her body really never completely recovered from the damage caused from the surgery let alone
[20:38.870 --> 20:45.070]  the treatments but in order for her to have survived and lived a quality of life for
[20:45.550 --> 20:47.550]  Pretty much two and a half years
[20:49.030 --> 20:54.190]  After the diagnosis and the surgery with just herbs and no no chemo
[20:54.190 --> 20:59.190]  No radiation is a testimony to the fact of how powerful they are
[20:59.190 --> 21:06.030]  And again, it was a combination of herbs that were some from Chinese some plants that are locally grown. There was kelp
[21:07.670 --> 21:10.950]  Cannabis obviously and these you know micro canna caps
[21:11.310 --> 21:16.710]  so that is a true testimony to the power of these plants and
[21:17.590 --> 21:24.310]  You know a big a big shame on you to the Western medical system for you know, basically pooh-poohing
[21:24.310 --> 21:31.270]  I mean the shit she went through you guys with the doctors and and their denial that this was doing anything and and that she
[21:31.270 --> 21:32.510]  Was just this
[21:32.510 --> 21:37.430]  Miracle patient they all called her a miracle patient and it used to piss her off
[21:38.110 --> 21:40.230]  Royally because it was like no fuck you
[21:40.630 --> 21:46.270]  Why don't you open your eyes to the fact that there's actually a lot more about medicine that you guys don't understand
[21:46.550 --> 21:53.590]  You know, we were all fine or a lot more healthy as a species prior to the introduction of both
[21:54.150 --> 21:56.150]  chemical farming as well as
[21:56.790 --> 22:00.430]  pharmaceutical medicines instead of what we used for
[22:01.350 --> 22:04.430]  Generations prior which was just plants in herbs
[22:05.110 --> 22:08.150]  And even some insects to to combat ailments
[22:08.510 --> 22:14.710]  So anyway, I that was that's my little rant and and why it's so important and why I wanted to have you guys
[22:14.710 --> 22:19.910]  Drag and fly on today is to talk more about these medical benefits of both cannabis
[22:20.390 --> 22:26.110]  And and let's start with the fungi let's start with what you guys do to actually harvest the
[22:28.110 --> 22:32.150]  Ingredients for that product and just quickly before you do
[22:32.670 --> 22:36.670]  Layton, how do you spell the name of that test? Do you see this Jethos Gardens?
[22:37.310 --> 22:41.410]  Question it's it's called the Keras test and I believe it's
[22:44.310 --> 22:47.070]  Dig it up, but it's not something commonly
[22:48.070 --> 22:52.670]  Western most doctors which again, it's a shame on her
[22:59.030 --> 23:00.970]  Depending on our internet, you know
[23:00.970 --> 23:05.310]  We might have to turn our camera off and we'll just look to you all to tell us if you can hear us
[23:05.310 --> 23:10.510]  Well, and then you know depending on on everything. We'll just see how how well it goes
[23:10.510 --> 23:12.630]  But go ahead first thing that I wanted to say
[23:13.630 --> 23:15.630]  You know
[23:16.470 --> 23:18.470]  So much love to you Layton
[23:18.790 --> 23:20.230]  Pauline
[23:20.230 --> 23:21.430]  was
[23:21.430 --> 23:27.030]  in her body an amazing unbelievable human being of love and light and
[23:27.510 --> 23:34.150]  Now out of her body. She's definitely gonna continue that love and light just like you and I talked about on the phone last week
[23:34.150 --> 23:36.150]  you know and and
[23:37.150 --> 23:40.470]  I'm just giving you all my love. There's not a whole lot of words
[23:41.750 --> 23:43.750]  That really ring true
[23:43.870 --> 23:46.950]  when somebody loses somebody that they love so much and
[23:47.430 --> 23:49.430]  And I just
[23:49.870 --> 23:56.910]  You know this this this episode is dedicated to Pauline but really so much is dedicated to Pauline so much
[23:57.870 --> 24:02.790]  The work that Dempere does in creating medicine and creating purity
[24:04.030 --> 24:07.430]  Community the work that she had done within her own community
[24:08.430 --> 24:12.830]  The herbalist work that she had pretty much spent an entire adult life working on
[24:13.230 --> 24:19.990]  Just fits so well in with us and she was just family right away the minute that you know, we met her so
[24:20.630 --> 24:23.590]  So much love to Pauline for the life work that she did
[24:23.750 --> 24:27.910]  On this planet and the work that she's gonna continue doing off of this planet
[24:28.190 --> 24:34.590]  And lots of love to you late and of course for being a support to her during all that time while you know
[24:34.590 --> 24:41.350]  Trying to put out information about how to make this world a better place all of you on the future cannabis project
[24:41.350 --> 24:45.630]  Big love to you. Thank you for doing that. I like that. You have a white Tara
[24:45.630 --> 24:49.950]  I mean a white Buddha behind you laden, you know symbolizing
[24:50.470 --> 24:51.870]  you know
[24:51.870 --> 24:58.830]  teachings and wisdom and clarity and purity, you know, those are the types of
[25:00.910 --> 25:03.390]  Things that bring us through these hard times, you know
[25:03.390 --> 25:09.830]  Those are the type of simple as the types headspace that make us that help us get through these times
[25:09.830 --> 25:12.310]  So a lot of transition happening right now
[25:12.910 --> 25:14.910]  death birth and
[25:15.190 --> 25:19.470]  And in that we celebrate life, which is what we at where we're at
[25:19.470 --> 25:26.550]  You know that the time keeps keeps ticking the clock keeps going and so we work on learning the lessons
[25:26.790 --> 25:28.790]  So that we can become stronger
[25:28.990 --> 25:30.190]  so
[25:30.190 --> 25:35.350]  You know a lot of a lot of heart space people, you know, I feel like a lot of
[25:36.070 --> 25:37.830]  focus in
[25:37.830 --> 25:39.070]  humanity
[25:39.070 --> 25:46.470]  Is a lot on the physical and I know that Pauline did so much physical work to make herself better. But the amount of
[25:47.150 --> 25:49.150]  spiritual emotional
[25:49.870 --> 25:56.350]  Work that she did is really where we all could learn from her
[25:57.830 --> 26:03.110]  It's where we all really need to head I feel like with this pandemic with separation
[26:04.350 --> 26:06.350]  with the medical world
[26:06.630 --> 26:12.270]  Western medicine allopathic medicine picking up I believe way too many
[26:14.110 --> 26:17.790]  Balls they're picking up balls that they don't even shouldn't be picking up
[26:18.110 --> 26:21.710]  they're picking up balls that they've never picked up before and
[26:22.270 --> 26:27.030]  they're gonna tell you that they know everything about the balls and all the history of the balls when in fact
[26:27.990 --> 26:33.230]  They really don't have any place in picking up those balls and that's really in health
[26:33.630 --> 26:36.270]  That's wellness and that's curatives
[26:37.430 --> 26:39.430]  unfortunately Western medicine
[26:39.430 --> 26:41.430]  When you go to them
[26:41.430 --> 26:44.750]  you're going to them for symptomatic healing or
[26:45.950 --> 26:47.470]  symptomatic curatives
[26:47.470 --> 26:50.450]  You're not going for an overall curative
[26:51.350 --> 26:57.990]  Now the work that I've been doing in my life has been both in allopathic medicine as well as naturopathic medicine
[26:58.430 --> 27:03.430]  And I work with a lot of doctors all over the world in the clinics that we open up
[27:04.110 --> 27:07.950]  And one thing that I can tell you on a personal level
[27:09.390 --> 27:14.550]  Outside of the system and how doctors and allopathic people feel is
[27:14.990 --> 27:20.550]  What when they come to our clinic they have to come to our clinic for at least three weeks
[27:21.070 --> 27:25.110]  Because of the integrative the work that happens with within you know
[27:25.150 --> 27:27.870]  When you come to Haiti when you go to Indonesia
[27:27.950 --> 27:34.470]  It takes at least three weeks to sort of get integrated and and start the work there and then we hope that they come back
[27:34.710 --> 27:36.950]  so it's just the first three weeks and
[27:37.550 --> 27:39.550]  when doctors come there and
[27:40.350 --> 27:43.030]  They don't have the ability to use their machines
[27:43.990 --> 27:45.990]  They don't have the ability to
[27:46.870 --> 27:50.230]  Use the pharmaceuticals that they've always used
[27:51.150 --> 27:56.550]  They realize they realize that that's all that the education that they ever really got
[27:57.470 --> 28:00.030]  so many doctors go into
[28:00.550 --> 28:03.150]  schooling to become healers and
[28:03.910 --> 28:09.030]  They leave become drug pushers and mechanic and and machinists
[28:10.430 --> 28:12.430]  so I have
[28:13.430 --> 28:14.710]  Literally
[28:14.710 --> 28:18.550]  Sat with some of the world's most leading doctors
[28:18.990 --> 28:26.150]  They come to our clinics and they're completely paralyzed because they've never been taught how to cure
[28:26.870 --> 28:31.910]  How to heal how to how to heal how to palpate how to feel how to touch people
[28:32.310 --> 28:36.350]  How to talk to them how to relate how to know what's going on
[28:36.590 --> 28:42.350]  How to check and I truly feel like we could put yeah disposition nutrition
[28:42.790 --> 28:46.670]  All of it where these people are living what their morning poop was like
[28:46.950 --> 28:55.630]  Just very simple things or stuff that they were never taught looks like they were never taught how to use as a diagnosis
[28:56.430 --> 29:01.590]  Because if they don't have a pharmaceutical pill or if they don't have some kind of a machine
[29:02.150 --> 29:04.070]  To work on you
[29:04.070 --> 29:06.070]  Then they have nothing
[29:06.950 --> 29:08.950]  And this is unfortunately
[29:09.550 --> 29:11.550]  the demise of the system
[29:12.550 --> 29:19.150]  But I also have to say it's the demise of the people who continue to believe in a broken system
[29:21.190 --> 29:23.190]  Shame on the system and
[29:24.070 --> 29:31.270]  Unfortunately shame on all of the doctors who continue to believe that this system that is going to give them clout
[29:32.030 --> 29:36.510]  That is going to give them money that is going to give them a place in the community
[29:37.310 --> 29:39.310]  comes before
[29:39.390 --> 29:42.950]  Curing and healing which is what they started out
[29:43.710 --> 29:45.710]  Doing in the first place
[29:45.910 --> 29:47.910]  now, what would it be like if
[29:49.070 --> 29:52.150]  Doctors got paid as much as teachers
[29:53.910 --> 29:57.150]  What kind of people would be drawn to that occupation
[29:57.150 --> 29:59.510]  We're totally out of balance
[30:00.270 --> 30:05.870]  We're out of balance because the people that are drawn to this occupation are people that are only interested in money
[30:06.430 --> 30:11.510]  That are only interested in this in the system that have faith in a broken system
[30:11.510 --> 30:15.710]  So therefore they're gonna have faith in continuing a broken practice
[30:17.510 --> 30:23.150]  It's unfortunate because right now health and well-being is the number one thing
[30:23.270 --> 30:27.670]  That is a highlighted focus in the world today
[30:28.710 --> 30:31.750]  Are we being lied to through this pandemic?
[30:32.550 --> 30:35.110]  Absolutely. I'm sorry people
[30:35.750 --> 30:37.750]  You're being lied to
[30:37.750 --> 30:39.030]  because
[30:39.030 --> 30:43.390]  Drugs that are being shot up into your body from an allopathic
[30:44.030 --> 30:48.870]  Doctor or from a pharmacy not a doctor. Sorry from a pharmacist or a pharmacy
[30:48.910 --> 30:51.950]  Is a whole slew of synthetic compounds
[30:52.950 --> 30:54.950]  Now what we understand is that
[30:55.830 --> 31:02.030]  Every single one and I challenge anyone out there. This is 30 years of my work. I
[31:03.030 --> 31:08.030]  Challenge anyone out there to find a pharmaceutical drug that doesn't destroy the microbiome
[31:10.270 --> 31:12.750]  Now if the microbiome is our only
[31:12.750 --> 31:16.950]  True immune system and true immune boosting and true immune
[31:18.070 --> 31:22.550]  systematic response and support to any kind of malady that we have in our body
[31:23.070 --> 31:25.630]  How is it that these curatives?
[31:26.630 --> 31:33.150]  That they're giving us are actually destroying our immune system, which is the only thing
[31:34.430 --> 31:36.430]  the only thing
[31:36.750 --> 31:38.750]  That we can do to help our body
[31:38.750 --> 31:40.750]  The only thing
[31:40.750 --> 31:47.870]  The only thing that kills cancer cells and will rejuvenate them into healthy cells
[31:49.070 --> 31:55.990]  Now what chemotherapy does and all these other pharmaceutical drugs and really is that they kill cancer cells?
[31:56.670 --> 31:58.670]  But they don't
[31:58.750 --> 32:01.630]  Reproduce healthy cells in their place
[32:01.990 --> 32:07.350]  The body does not have the automatic immune system response
[32:07.830 --> 32:11.510]  From those drugs to immediately produce healthy cells
[32:12.750 --> 32:18.830]  Healthy cells come from immune system now people who have had chemotherapy and they get healthy from that
[32:19.310 --> 32:26.030]  It still is their immune system that is kicked off and created and grown healthy cells
[32:26.030 --> 32:28.030]  In the wake of the chemotherapy
[32:28.030 --> 32:31.110]  So this is where the education of
[32:32.230 --> 32:33.750]  drugs
[32:33.750 --> 32:35.750]  allopathic medicine
[32:35.990 --> 32:37.990]  allopathic
[32:38.190 --> 32:39.670]  protocols
[32:39.670 --> 32:45.470]  All of them lead to the demise of our immune response, which makes us dependent
[32:45.990 --> 32:53.310]  Which then makes us dependent and I'm gonna go ahead and roll it right over to plants and what it's like for a
[32:53.830 --> 32:55.830]  synthetic garden
[32:56.830 --> 33:02.870]  To be fed all of a sudden one day a new dude comes in there and he says you know what I'm gonna feed this
[33:02.870 --> 33:08.030]  Entire synthetic garden all organic everything what's gonna happen to those plants?
[33:08.710 --> 33:13.790]  They go yellow they go yellow because and they will die because they're totally
[33:14.470 --> 33:16.750]  dependent on the NPK
[33:17.710 --> 33:19.150]  synthetic
[33:19.150 --> 33:21.190]  pharmaceutical feeding system
[33:22.150 --> 33:27.630]  Those plants no longer have a healthy microbiome a healthy immune response
[33:28.150 --> 33:31.590]  Because they only know how to grow with synthetics
[33:33.510 --> 33:39.270]  You know invigorated their own immune response so there's so they're dependent completely on
[33:40.790 --> 33:45.630]  You know direct feeding so let's not think for one second that
[33:46.150 --> 33:50.470]  It's no different that when you're feeding somebody a bunch of
[33:50.950 --> 33:54.870]  Pharmaceutical drugs a bunch of food that isn't actually nutrient-rich
[33:55.390 --> 34:02.390]  Their body becomes dependent on that when you try to take it away and you try to actually integrate nature
[34:03.030 --> 34:05.030]  integrate healthy
[34:05.430 --> 34:08.910]  microbiome responsive foods and practices
[34:10.230 --> 34:11.830]  that person
[34:11.830 --> 34:18.670]  Might have a very difficult time up taking it and also their biome will then a
[34:19.390 --> 34:23.670]  Microbiome is like a second brain. So once your microbiome is
[34:24.430 --> 34:30.750]  challenged or compromised then you're not capable of thinking in the same way as
[34:31.030 --> 34:35.790]  If you're totally nourished by by natural compounds, you know
[34:35.790 --> 34:39.750]  And and we look towards nature and the type of nature
[34:40.550 --> 34:48.030]  Systems that are around to replenish our body with with this intelligence and that's where herbalism builds us up and
[34:48.510 --> 34:50.710]  And we should look towards herbalism
[34:50.710 --> 34:58.430]  You know as the first line of wellness or food as the first line of wellness or exercise and breathing
[34:58.550 --> 35:01.310]  You know breath breath Italians, you know
[35:01.310 --> 35:09.510]  And when we and also, you know to look at the full closed-loop system of a human microbiome is not only our
[35:10.150 --> 35:11.190]  we
[35:11.190 --> 35:12.750]  inoculating
[35:12.750 --> 35:14.750]  healthy and pathogenic
[35:15.350 --> 35:18.310]  Microbiology into our body, but we're also feeding
[35:19.110 --> 35:23.910]  said either pathogens or said beneficials within our body
[35:25.310 --> 35:31.830]  Unfortunately, then again that leads into this other terrible closed-loop of death
[35:33.510 --> 35:38.710]  Basically because if you don't have proper inoculation and
[35:39.230 --> 35:45.070]  Then if you're taking pharmaceuticals and you're eating food that is already
[35:45.710 --> 35:47.030]  processed
[35:47.030 --> 35:53.830]  Then what type of microbiology? Are you continuing to feed inside of your body? Are you continuing to?
[35:55.950 --> 35:57.950]  So
[35:59.590 --> 36:05.550]  It is no different the soil in the garden beds no different than our own microbiology
[36:06.150 --> 36:10.670]  With body so this intelligence comes from
[36:12.150 --> 36:14.150]  Long time
[36:14.390 --> 36:20.030]  Historical it comes from our you know inside of our mother's belly it comes from life
[36:20.030 --> 36:23.270]  It comes from us digging into the garden now
[36:23.270 --> 36:27.470]  Like I've said before with you guys is that a lot of people like to take
[36:28.630 --> 36:30.630]  you know yogurts and
[36:31.270 --> 36:38.470]  Probiotics and we know that probiotics last in the system for about 72 hours and that's only in an upper digestive
[36:38.950 --> 36:41.030]  Tract will they stay alive?
[36:41.950 --> 36:48.750]  Now the microbiology that lasts in our body that truly makes up our immune response
[36:50.350 --> 36:56.550]  Crosses the blood-brain barrier and we're born with it as well as if we inoculated
[36:57.310 --> 37:00.270]  Into our body it comes from nature
[37:00.790 --> 37:09.150]  So when we look at all of those things that people are having continuous lifelong maladies either mental emotional spiritual
[37:09.790 --> 37:11.070]  physical maladies
[37:11.070 --> 37:14.510]  We recognize that a tremendous amount of microbiology
[37:15.270 --> 37:21.390]  That is found in healthy natural systems in soil are devoid within our own body
[37:22.110 --> 37:24.110]  so somewhere in
[37:24.790 --> 37:26.790]  Humanity
[37:26.830 --> 37:30.310]  With religion or with education is
[37:31.190 --> 37:35.310]  Continuously trying to take us away from our connection with nature
[37:36.350 --> 37:42.790]  Religion even in the 1100 said that you know nature is dirty and that to have dirt on you
[37:43.070 --> 37:47.230]  You're dirty and then that was when they started to integrate
[37:47.710 --> 37:52.550]  Allopathic systems it was also the time that they did massive amounts of killing
[37:52.830 --> 37:57.710]  People talk about it was the witches that they killed but it wasn't just the witches that they killed
[37:58.070 --> 38:01.030]  It was the people that were attached to nature
[38:01.750 --> 38:08.110]  That refused to say that bloodletting and mercury building were probably good
[38:09.350 --> 38:10.710]  practices
[38:10.710 --> 38:17.070]  For the body because it was so far away from the education that they had been given which is within
[38:17.310 --> 38:20.350]  response to and given by nature
[38:21.190 --> 38:22.430]  So
[38:22.430 --> 38:26.910]  history over and over and over again continues to redefine
[38:27.750 --> 38:32.430]  What health is within humanity when all it takes is?
[38:33.590 --> 38:41.670]  five seconds of standing in a healthy successive forest to understand what true nature and
[38:44.070 --> 38:46.550]  Successive nature gives us true health and well-being
[38:47.230 --> 38:54.230]  And on the note of fungi, you know, we it's documented for thousands of years in China and
[38:54.830 --> 38:56.830]  in Asian countries
[38:57.070 --> 39:04.550]  That mushrooms were known as the mushroom of immortality reishi ling chi, you know a ganoderma
[39:07.070 --> 39:13.690]  Ganoderma well, there's a ganoderma or or against and there and there's all kinds of there's three different kinds of ganodermas and they
[39:14.370 --> 39:19.010]  Well, they they grow in different parts of the world and and they they've known for centuries that
[39:20.650 --> 39:22.010]  Its
[39:22.010 --> 39:24.010]  intelligence works with our body and
[39:24.290 --> 39:30.010]  They even kept it secret for you know, I don't know how long because I wasn't thousands of years
[39:30.010 --> 39:33.890]  I kept it secret is what you hear what you read about for thousands of years
[39:33.890 --> 39:41.810]  It was secret that mushrooms were used on an everyday as an everyday food to keep us healthy and in some ways to just
[39:42.090 --> 39:44.090]  Defy
[39:44.210 --> 39:46.210]  Cellular death our
[39:46.210 --> 39:53.770]  Cells regenerate every every day, you know and and more than every day, but our cells are constantly regenerating
[39:53.770 --> 39:56.830]  There's no thing that says our cells should degenerate
[39:57.010 --> 40:01.610]  so when you use herbs and you use mushrooms it keeps a
[40:02.210 --> 40:06.330]  generation happening it regenerates the vitality of your cells because
[40:07.010 --> 40:12.610]  Mushrooms are like humans they breathe in oxygen and they breathe out carbon dioxide
[40:13.130 --> 40:17.230]  They live symbiotic in the environment and their aids to us
[40:18.010 --> 40:22.650]  Why what is a medicinal mushroom a medicinal mushroom is often?
[40:24.370 --> 40:32.210]  Classified as a polypore and a polypore grows on a tree and it doesn't have gills it has pores and
[40:32.810 --> 40:34.450]  The
[40:34.450 --> 40:36.170]  importance of tree medicine
[40:36.170 --> 40:42.330]  we often overlook tree medicine as as an herb as a supplement because
[40:42.770 --> 40:49.450]  It's a lot about annual herbs or bushes or even leaves that come and go every year
[40:49.450 --> 40:53.770]  And in some cases, of course, you know, there's roots and there's you know, there's leaves
[40:53.770 --> 40:58.170]  but but trees are giant beings that connect the
[40:58.650 --> 41:02.690]  Stars that connect the air to the earth and they live
[41:03.970 --> 41:07.930]  hundreds of years a thousand years two thousand years and
[41:08.850 --> 41:15.170]  They're pulsing medicine and they're fusing and they're creating medicine in their roots. They're creating the medicine
[41:15.170 --> 41:19.290]  They need based off their makeup and it goes up in the Kim layer
[41:20.290 --> 41:22.290]  And
[41:25.050 --> 41:27.850]  Well the ignorance of the modern day
[41:28.490 --> 41:31.610]  I know logs and forestry people that have
[41:32.170 --> 41:35.930]  And see honks on treason tried to cut tree down
[41:36.730 --> 41:41.530]  Or knock the conch out of the tree because that the conch
[41:42.530 --> 41:44.530]  or killing the first
[41:45.370 --> 41:48.210]  well, it's worth more standing because
[41:49.570 --> 41:52.850]  The because it's the opposite of allopathic medicine
[41:53.450 --> 41:58.170]  Isolation comes from Western medicine isolating compound. Oh that compound worked
[41:58.170 --> 42:02.290]  We're gonna sign multiply that compound and act and have it do its job
[42:02.810 --> 42:07.210]  But it's diversity that keeps us that keeps us pulsing
[42:07.410 --> 42:11.050]  So tree medicine thousand years of trees growing
[42:11.050 --> 42:17.250]  I just wanted to say that the tree is mining all of these minerals and nutrients. We can't eat a tree
[42:17.570 --> 42:19.570]  You can eat bar but you can
[42:20.530 --> 42:25.570]  You can definitely eat the mushroom that has secondary
[42:26.090 --> 42:32.010]  Metabolized all of what the tree has been up taking for 2,000 years. Maybe even a thousand years, whatever
[42:32.370 --> 42:36.690]  so what it does is it takes all of the all of the
[42:37.730 --> 42:42.450]  Hyperintelligence of the immune response of that tree and it puts it into a polypore
[42:43.450 --> 42:49.930]  Which is totally where we can consume it and and that is what is in our micro canna caps is a
[42:50.730 --> 42:52.730]  tremendous amount of polypores
[42:53.250 --> 42:59.450]  From the forest from old growth intact largest intact old growth forest in
[42:59.810 --> 43:04.970]  British Columbia and southern British Columbia at least we're getting medicine out of the forest and
[43:05.690 --> 43:09.970]  By taking those polypores off the trees. We're not harming the trees
[43:10.970 --> 43:17.690]  We're not harming the forest if we find six polypores on one tree we might take two
[43:18.330 --> 43:25.770]  Because what we do want is we want those sport. We want those polypores to continue sporulating so that they continue growing
[43:26.050 --> 43:33.290]  So just like a farmer you want to make sure that you don't you don't harvest your favorite
[43:33.290 --> 43:37.730]  You don't harvest all of your tomatoes and eat them off of your favorite tomato
[43:38.290 --> 43:45.090]  Tree plant you want to save some seeds from your favorite tomato plant? That's the same as when you're leaving
[43:46.090 --> 43:50.730]  Leaving the seed the spore from the mushroom and then I just sort of wanted to sidetracked here
[43:50.730 --> 43:55.330]  Is that you know when we talk about allopathic medicine and and now our?
[43:56.090 --> 43:58.090]  awakening to
[43:58.210 --> 43:59.970]  allopathic medicine
[43:59.970 --> 44:01.970]  allopathic education
[44:02.290 --> 44:04.290]  allopathic science
[44:04.770 --> 44:06.530]  allopathic religion
[44:06.530 --> 44:08.530]  When we look at all of those things
[44:10.090 --> 44:16.210]  What they're all meant to do is take away our power
[44:18.370 --> 44:20.370]  When we are healthy and
[44:20.530 --> 44:28.250]  When our immune response is working at his ultimate and its finest and its quickest we're powerful
[44:28.250 --> 44:29.890]  We're powerful
[44:29.890 --> 44:31.890]  hard to fuck with us
[44:32.250 --> 44:34.250]  When people are powerful
[44:34.850 --> 44:36.850]  People can't be fucked with
[44:37.610 --> 44:42.490]  When people are powerful they want to go and find out more information
[44:43.730 --> 44:45.610]  They want to know
[44:45.610 --> 44:50.050]  Wait a minute. Maybe I've been lied to from second grade all the way through
[44:50.810 --> 44:54.610]  University and maybe all the way through my doctorate. Hmm
[44:55.730 --> 44:58.450]  When we're intelligent we question
[44:59.450 --> 45:03.930]  We look into our history we recognize that we've been lied to
[45:04.850 --> 45:07.410]  Because they don't want you powerful
[45:08.090 --> 45:13.650]  And it's not possible to wipe out humanity from sickness
[45:14.730 --> 45:21.250]  It's not possible. Otherwise, we wouldn't be here right now and we know that we've gone through at least
[45:21.250 --> 45:23.250]  Oh
[45:23.610 --> 45:32.330]  Is it five mass extinctions three shit someone's I get up five mass extinctions on the planet now the world didn't
[45:32.650 --> 45:36.330]  repopulate from a petri dish after that mass extinction
[45:36.850 --> 45:44.690]  The world repopulated from natural compounds and it built nature and then it rebuilt humanity. So in our
[45:45.810 --> 45:49.090]  Understanding we're allying with that timeless
[45:49.730 --> 45:57.010]  Tradition why is it that cannabis is now proven to kill kovat? Why is it proven that?
[45:58.610 --> 46:01.730]  Seabuckthorn for me fermentations can kill kovat
[46:02.450 --> 46:05.490]  Because there's there million-year-old
[46:06.250 --> 46:12.650]  illnesses matched with million-year-old medicines matched with us who are million-year-old humans of
[46:13.290 --> 46:17.610]  Course it works and now you got a wonder so do the illnesses
[46:18.010 --> 46:22.210]  You know what comes first the chicken or the eggs so is it the
[46:22.810 --> 46:27.130]  curatives from the forest that come first or is the illnesses that come first because
[46:27.650 --> 46:31.970]  Certainly feels like everybody is putting all of their energy and effort onto illness
[46:32.650 --> 46:40.570]  When it actually could have been the medicines in the forest that were created first for the illnesses and we're all freaking out
[46:40.570 --> 46:42.570]  on
[46:43.450 --> 46:45.450]  Isolating
[46:46.450 --> 46:48.450]  Ideas
[46:48.610 --> 46:50.610]  isolating compounds
[46:50.930 --> 46:53.890]  isolating even like where we stand certain topics
[46:54.450 --> 47:00.130]  We're isolating. Okay. Well science taught me this at this one moment in time
[47:01.130 --> 47:04.130]  Well, you don't even believe in science
[47:04.130 --> 47:07.610]  If you're saying I believe in science that taught me this one thing at one time
[47:07.810 --> 47:11.090]  Because when you believe in science, you realize that science is ever-changing
[47:12.090 --> 47:14.090]  And
[47:14.970 --> 47:20.570]  Basically you believe in things always changing when you believe in science so when we are in our true power we recognize
[47:21.330 --> 47:23.010]  that things have the
[47:23.010 --> 47:27.810]  capability to learn and that we have the capability to be smarter than we were yesterday and
[47:28.010 --> 47:35.050]  When we understand that we have the ability to be smarter than we are yesterday and that some guy who said something
[47:35.050 --> 47:38.810]  Ten years ago is still holding strong today, which doesn't make any sense
[47:39.210 --> 47:41.890]  We really have to question our power
[47:43.530 --> 47:46.570]  We have to question our immune response
[47:48.050 --> 47:54.130]  We have to question where it is that we're getting our power fun from and if it is true
[47:54.450 --> 47:56.450]  Because if we're getting our power from
[47:56.930 --> 47:59.650]  Some guy that said something ten years ago
[48:00.370 --> 48:07.210]  Rather than our own powerful immune response denying something that doesn't feel right in me today
[48:08.210 --> 48:10.570]  About somebody that said something ten years ago
[48:11.250 --> 48:15.650]  Then we're truly in our power because we're constantly questioning illness
[48:16.650 --> 48:21.730]  and wellness and if we're not constantly questioning illness, how in the hell are we gonna get better and
[48:22.250 --> 48:30.210]  Why are we trusting somebody from ten years ago? That isn't even a part of this intelligent powerful conversation right now
[48:31.970 --> 48:33.850]  That's nature
[48:33.850 --> 48:35.850]  That's the power of nature
[48:36.330 --> 48:41.650]  Nature is right now with everything from its history to bring us to right now
[48:42.810 --> 48:49.130]  Can it take care of the toxins that have been poured underneath the tree that maybe somebody you know?
[48:49.290 --> 48:51.290]  something happened to their car and some
[48:52.010 --> 48:54.010]  gasoline poured underneath a
[48:54.250 --> 48:56.250]  2,000 year old tree
[48:57.010 --> 49:04.290]  Every single bit of its all-powerful immune response is going to go into healing that gasoline area
[49:04.890 --> 49:11.810]  Because it is in its power and because it has memory and history of wellness
[49:13.290 --> 49:19.170]  So what I'm starting to be very concerned about in the human population is we don't even have
[49:20.490 --> 49:22.490]  historical memory
[49:22.730 --> 49:24.730]  cellular memory of
[49:25.050 --> 49:26.330]  wellness
[49:26.330 --> 49:32.970]  Because illness has been such a huge commodity. It has been such a huge
[49:34.930 --> 49:38.840]  Focus on
[49:40.560 --> 49:42.560]  Humanity and
[49:43.080 --> 49:45.080]  The outcome of it is
[49:45.520 --> 49:47.520]  Not even real
[49:47.560 --> 49:53.600]  So we're spending all of this time and energy on to something that is isolating more and more
[49:53.880 --> 49:56.800]  Compounds that is going to make humanity more and more sick
[49:56.960 --> 50:04.360]  Which is going to make us more and more incapable of being able to be powerful and being able to be intelligent
[50:06.760 --> 50:14.400]  Something's got to change and the only way that that can truly change is if we start aligning with nature and we
[50:14.680 --> 50:16.440]  stop
[50:16.440 --> 50:18.720]  looking towards humans as
[50:19.240 --> 50:21.160]  mentors
[50:21.160 --> 50:23.160]  Josh and I are talking here right now
[50:24.120 --> 50:25.600]  We are
[50:25.600 --> 50:27.600]  We are imperfect
[50:28.320 --> 50:30.000]  totally
[50:30.000 --> 50:33.000]  You know, we're not we're humans, too
[50:33.560 --> 50:35.560]  Sure, we may be saying
[50:36.120 --> 50:40.880]  Something that resonates with you and resonates in your very core
[50:41.560 --> 50:47.000]  Well, if it resonates in your very core because you already know it's because you already knew it
[50:47.000 --> 50:51.680]  It's because you're healthy microbiome and powerful intelligent
[50:52.320 --> 50:58.040]  Immune system that you had already knew it. It's not because we're mentors. I
[50:58.080 --> 50:59.760]  Mentors I
[50:59.760 --> 51:01.680]  really encourage
[51:01.680 --> 51:08.880]  humanity to start looking towards nature as our true mentors what if we are and to stop looking at
[51:09.200 --> 51:11.200]  humanity as our mentors because
[51:11.960 --> 51:13.680]  we are
[51:13.680 --> 51:15.360]  we are
[51:15.360 --> 51:21.600]  We are not perfect in any way shape or form and the history that we've come from is of sickness
[51:22.560 --> 51:24.560]  My parent my mother died of cancer
[51:25.080 --> 51:26.880]  I'm from sickness
[51:26.880 --> 51:32.400]  Her mother died early of cancer. We have wars. We have toxicity
[51:32.400 --> 51:39.040]  We have all kinds of these crazy human experiments that have been happening all in the name of allopathic
[51:39.400 --> 51:47.200]  medicine in education when there's blue zones on that people live over a hundred and twenty years and those blue zones don't rely on
[51:47.720 --> 51:49.560]  on
[51:49.560 --> 51:53.680]  Allopathic medicine what I hope everyone knows what a blue zone is because a blue zone
[51:53.680 --> 52:00.960]  there's like five of them on the earth and that we know about and people live over a hundred and twenty because they have lots of
[52:01.640 --> 52:03.640]  trace minerals
[52:03.760 --> 52:06.320]  Micronutrients lots of diversity exercise
[52:07.160 --> 52:08.280]  community
[52:08.280 --> 52:13.160]  Less toxicity. They figure out you can't expect to be well without
[52:14.080 --> 52:19.120]  Doing all the other work, you know Pauline understood that that's why she lived so long
[52:19.120 --> 52:21.480]  that's what this is all tying into is
[52:22.160 --> 52:29.520]  People like Pauline or Kelly's mom for example had cancer in 1982. They gave her I hope that's right
[52:29.520 --> 52:34.080]  I mean my numbers are wrong, but she gave her six months to live and they gave her chemotherapy
[52:34.640 --> 52:36.960]  52 times in one year every week
[52:37.680 --> 52:39.680]  52 times that year and
[52:40.160 --> 52:42.160]  She ended up living
[52:42.160 --> 52:43.680]  but her
[52:43.680 --> 52:47.040]  whole entire life after that was herbal medicine
[52:47.520 --> 52:52.840]  Exercise yoga and dance she lived for another 30 how many I mean
[52:52.840 --> 52:57.280]  Well, she was she's also a PhD that worked with people in dying
[52:58.000 --> 53:06.440]  so she worked with women and people in dying in living wells with with with their families, so I
[53:07.480 --> 53:16.040]  Think that the most important thing really to sum this all up is that what we're taking is we're taking sick information
[53:16.640 --> 53:19.280]  Because it's been given to us as
[53:20.200 --> 53:21.800]  intelligent
[53:21.800 --> 53:25.360]  education and then we're building off of that and
[53:26.200 --> 53:31.200]  You all know what? It's like to build off of a
[53:31.840 --> 53:34.480]  building that has a broken
[53:37.200 --> 53:40.520]  Whole structure a foundation that is broken
[53:41.480 --> 53:43.200]  cannot build
[53:43.200 --> 53:45.000]  something of
[53:45.080 --> 53:47.360]  strength and integrity and intelligence
[53:48.760 --> 53:52.440]  So somehow where we are in humanity is
[53:53.080 --> 53:59.040]  we're now realizing that our foundations are incredibly broken and
[53:59.840 --> 54:03.920]  That we need to reach further than we've ever reached before
[54:04.720 --> 54:12.320]  To try to find out where our true power comes from and I can guarantee you that that true power is not going to come
[54:12.320 --> 54:14.320]  from
[54:14.640 --> 54:16.640]  Humans in their education
[54:18.040 --> 54:23.800]  It's gonna come from us observing nature and then us writing it down and
[54:25.160 --> 54:29.640]  us understanding the influence that nature has upon humanity
[54:30.400 --> 54:36.200]  Because when we start understanding the influence that nature has upon humanity, then we start realizing
[54:37.240 --> 54:43.120]  the multitude and the complexity and that it's so far away from isolating
[54:43.840 --> 54:45.840]  That
[54:46.480 --> 54:48.800]  Like isolation then really makes no sense at all
[54:50.160 --> 54:54.200]  Wow, that was beautiful. I was that was just fucking beautiful
[54:55.440 --> 54:57.160]  I
[54:57.160 --> 55:00.480]  Don't know if you've heard this story before but I'm gonna say it anyway, I
[55:02.320 --> 55:06.160]  My my cousin married a doctor
[55:07.200 --> 55:09.080]  chief of staff
[55:09.080 --> 55:11.000]  He was in an ER room
[55:11.040 --> 55:17.280]  So he had to know, you know a lot about the different groups of medicine again medicine is
[55:18.880 --> 55:22.480]  Reduction so you you become a specialist in one form or another
[55:23.680 --> 55:25.360]  but to be
[55:25.360 --> 55:31.720]  Able to handle all of the different specialties in in, you know, one person is very difficult
[55:31.720 --> 55:33.720]  So you have to be a really really smart person
[55:34.880 --> 55:36.880]  Anyway, we were sitting around
[55:36.960 --> 55:38.320]  celebrating
[55:38.320 --> 55:40.320]  the death of an uncle
[55:40.320 --> 55:43.760]  or we were together as a family and in a celebration and
[55:46.200 --> 55:51.880]  He was having a glass of wine I was having a glass of scotch and he said your cousin told me that
[55:52.600 --> 55:58.480]  You're you're you're working with soil biology, you know do explain. Tell me tell me more
[55:59.200 --> 56:00.880]  And I said, well
[56:00.880 --> 56:02.800]  I'm using
[56:02.800 --> 56:04.800]  fish manure and
[56:04.800 --> 56:08.000]  Plant or vegan based compost to grow out
[56:09.000 --> 56:16.160]  Protozoa and different types of bacteria that will help complete a soil system or take dirt make it back to soil
[56:16.960 --> 56:21.200]  to grow healthy plants and obviously to filter rainwater and
[56:21.800 --> 56:28.200]  He goes do you have protozoa in this product? And I said, oh god. Yeah, so, you know the protozoan are in the millions
[56:28.920 --> 56:34.440]  And he goes you ever heard of a fecal transplant and I was like no what is what's involved in a fecal transplant?
[56:34.960 --> 56:36.960]  Well, basically they take
[56:37.640 --> 56:41.880]  Manure poop from from a healthy brother or sister
[56:42.520 --> 56:47.600]  And they put it back into your body because if you've gone through chemo or one of these other
[56:48.640 --> 56:49.920]  horrific
[56:49.920 --> 56:51.200]  You know
[56:51.200 --> 56:53.960]  Medicinal or I should say toxic synthetic
[56:55.000 --> 57:00.200]  Treatments you've basically wiped out your gut biome, which is what dragonfly was just talking about
[57:00.200 --> 57:04.520]  So they have to when a sick person is fed food after that
[57:04.920 --> 57:08.760]  They can no longer break down that food and and
[57:09.160 --> 57:13.400]  Their body can't process it into minerals and nutrients. So it just goes in and out
[57:13.800 --> 57:17.200]  So they get no nutritional value out of the food that they intake
[57:18.000 --> 57:25.040]  So by transplanting the fecal matter from a healthy person into a person that has no gut biome
[57:25.760 --> 57:28.080]  That's the way they jumpstart the system
[57:28.680 --> 57:30.480]  So
[57:30.480 --> 57:32.480]  I'm like that's really bizarre
[57:32.480 --> 57:36.720]  But I can kind of grasp what you're talking about because basically that's the work
[57:36.720 --> 57:40.400]  I do is I take dirt and turn it back into soil. So we'll grow healthy plants
[57:42.120 --> 57:46.560]  And so, you know, I said well are you interested in you know?
[57:46.560 --> 57:52.760]  Because I could set up a clean room and and harvest, you know plants out of the forest or nature
[57:53.200 --> 57:59.200]  In areas that I know that are really healthy and produce you a basically a medical grade
[58:00.320 --> 58:08.000]  Compost that you could use either in a Catholic form orally or suppository or even as in a nunnery
[58:08.800 --> 58:14.400]  To treat these people naturally and he was blown away. He was like, oh my god. I'm gonna go back
[58:14.400 --> 58:18.880]  I'm gonna meet with the board. I'm gonna talk about this as a healthy way to
[58:19.760 --> 58:23.640]  Bring back the total health of the gut biome not just a
[58:24.640 --> 58:30.040]  Relative who who's eating who knows what or is on how many different pharmaceuticals?
[58:30.040 --> 58:35.640]  And so he said I'll get back to you in a week. I didn't hear back from him
[58:35.640 --> 58:39.600]  So two weeks later, I called him and said hey, what's up with that? He said I'm sorry late
[58:39.600 --> 58:41.840]  And I you know, I was really really excited about this
[58:41.840 --> 58:45.880]  But unfortunately the board has made a decision that they're not going to pursue this
[58:46.400 --> 58:49.840]  Based on one simple fact they can't monetize
[58:50.520 --> 58:52.520]  they can't sell this and
[58:52.920 --> 59:00.180]  That was like horrifying to me to hear this and this was probably ten years ago now
[59:00.720 --> 59:02.680]  Maybe twelve
[59:02.680 --> 59:05.440]  That the system would reject a way
[59:06.160 --> 59:08.520]  to cure a problem
[59:09.880 --> 59:11.880]  Not just treat it and
[59:12.200 --> 59:18.840]  So along what you guys were saying, you know in even taking it to the next level and talking about a tree
[59:20.040 --> 59:22.040]  Who's processing air?
[59:22.160 --> 59:24.160]  sunlight water
[59:24.200 --> 59:25.440]  creating a
[59:25.440 --> 59:32.840]  Incredible micro biome now again, the plants have their stomach on the outside of the roots where we have our stomach on the inside
[59:33.920 --> 59:35.360]  and
[59:35.360 --> 59:37.360]  converting all of those things into
[59:38.200 --> 59:40.200]  Expressions of nature that
[59:41.120 --> 59:42.880]  Have very powerful
[59:42.880 --> 59:49.680]  Side effects in especially in the human body that it hasn't been exposed to it for so long. You know, I love your
[59:50.400 --> 59:52.400]  mention of the churches and how
[59:52.960 --> 59:57.280]  They literally, you know wiped out all the medicine and all medicine women
[59:58.080 --> 01:00:02.400]  Everywhere they went because of what you were saying it's about control
[01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:07.200]  Prior to that, you know loyalty would always not allow the
[01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:13.400]  peasants to be educated because if they were educated they'd be powerful and therefore
[01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:19.040]  They would realize that the king had no power. He was just the same as them human being
[01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:24.880]  It's our pants on the same way. He did and she does so there's so much truth to that
[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:28.760]  keeping people sick is a
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:35.080]  Incredibly powerful money-making machine and by not educating the people that are taking care of
[01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:40.840]  You is a perfect way to keep you in the system keep you
[01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:43.160]  producing more money
[01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:45.960]  Taking more pills. And so yeah that
[01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:51.200]  Building on a broken foundation building on you know, building a high high rise on
[01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:55.760]  Sandbar probably not a good idea, but that's the way it is
[01:00:55.760 --> 01:01:01.360]  You know people know me for going on rants and I'm sorry, I'm not ranting right now. I just don't have a lot of energy
[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:05.680]  But the system after being exposed to it for the last
[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:11.920]  Three years the battles that Pauline went through the stress that they put her under
[01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:18.480]  You know, it's a miracle her body didn't collapse earlier. I mean she had insurance right everything was fine
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:22.120]  She was able to get her medical bills and she was able to get her medical bills
[01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:30.400]  But the system after being exposed to it for the last three years the battles that Pauline went through the stress that they put her under
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:35.360]  You know people know me for going on rants and I'm sorry, I'm not ranting right now
[01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:43.120]  It's a miracle her body didn't collapse earlier. I mean she had insurance right? Everybody believes that by buying health insurance
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:45.640]  They're covered against a catastrophic illness
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:49.560]  looking over their shoulder. There's no way to compare prices. As a matter of fact, I believe
[01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:53.880]  they just passed a law now that you can ask for how much is this operation going to cost me.
[01:01:54.520 --> 01:02:01.640]  The hospital now finally has to disclose that. She was whacked well into the $200,000
[01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:09.560]  of debt after that surgery. Again, she didn't do radiation or chemo. She just had a surgery.
[01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:16.280]  You look at this and you say, well, wait a minute. I pay X amount of dollars for health insurance
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:23.400]  a month. That's supposed to cover all this stuff, right? Well, if you get a policy, you'll see every
[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:30.200]  year you get an update with a stack of papers of all the things they no longer cover, not the things
[01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:35.720]  that they're now covering. Every year you're getting less and less benefit from this policy
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:42.680]  and more and more hidden expenses that you're not going to know what they are until after the fact.
[01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:50.760]  Pauline spent nine months, 10 months battling every different bill that came in and showing
[01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:57.160]  that she had no income. She had no way to pay this back and asking for grants, asking for
[01:02:57.160 --> 01:03:02.840]  donations, asking within the hospital, are there support groups for dealing with this?
[01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:09.240]  But eventually she fought her way through all of that debt. But the toll on her, basically it was
[01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:16.200]  a more than full-time job, seven days a week for almost, like I said, almost a year, at least 10
[01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:22.680]  months. So it goes to show you again, the manipulation of using fear to scare you into
[01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:30.600]  paying for an insurance policy that's actually going to make things worse for you. And here's
[01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:37.080]  a prime example. I have a health issue. I'm getting older, so of course. And I looked into
[01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:44.040]  getting a policy and the policy that I got was quoted for, and this is from a friend of mine,
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:48.760]  because I'm not going to just go to any random person and discuss these kinds of things.
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:57.320]  Basically he said a decent policy that'll cover you for the broadest amount of potential problems
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:04.680]  in your health in the future is this policy. It's $1,500 a month. You'll have a $10,000 deductible
[01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:12.120]  or a $15,000 deductible, depending on which way you want to do your copay. So if you pay more as
[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:18.920]  a copay upfront, you have less of a deductible. These guys are sitting around calculating exactly
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:29.080]  how to suck the most money they can out of you. So after looking at this policy and determining
[01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:36.840]  that I needed a CAT scan, I went around and got quotes from these different subcontractors of the
[01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:42.360]  medical industry that own these pieces of equipment. And based on my insurance, if I was
[01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:50.520]  fully insured, it would be somewhere between $2,700 and $7,000 for the CAT scan. So after
[01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:57.160]  calculating out what it would have been based on deductible copay and monthly premium, it was going
[01:04:57.160 --> 01:05:05.480]  to be about $4,700 for this CAT scan. So then I decided that I wasn't going to get this policy
[01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:11.880]  because it's just too much fuck your money. And I went ahead and called one of the places and I
[01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:15.960]  said, Hey, listen, I don't have insurance. And they're like, Oh, no, no problem. No problem.
[01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:22.280]  We take cash. And I was like, Oh, fantastic. How much would it cost if I paid you with a credit
[01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:33.560]  card or cash? $350. Think about that for a minute. $350 versus $4,700. Did the insurance company do
[01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:40.040]  me any favors? They wanted to charge me 20x of what it would have cost me in cash out of pocket.
[01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:47.480]  So the whole insurance industry is feeding the medical industry by making you pay more
[01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:57.240]  for a procedure or a process or a tool that you should have access to as a human, as a human
[01:05:57.240 --> 01:06:03.880]  right. Clean water, clean food, clean medicine. Those rights don't exist anymore. We're actually
[01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:10.920]  just being so manipulated by fear that it's not funny. And anybody that I talk to about this,
[01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:16.360]  they get upset with me, especially if they have an insurance policy and a real job.
[01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:22.920]  They're like, No, no, you're full of shit. And I'm like, No, I'm sorry. That's a harsh truth.
[01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:28.200]  That's a harsh reality. And I wish the audience and everybody else really think about that.
[01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:35.000]  How? I mean, does anybody question the doctor if they say, Hey, you need a CT scan? Do you go,
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:39.800]  well, how much is it going to cost me? No, you don't question the doctor. You go, Oh, shit. Okay.
[01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:48.920]  Where do I go? And they tell you where to go. Why? Well, because the more money that you pay for this,
[01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:55.320]  the more money comes back to them with other referrals and other, how do I say this? Can't
[01:06:55.320 --> 01:07:03.560]  say kickbacks anymore. Benefits, trips, up your education. Yeah, we're going to send you to Hawaii
[01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:11.880]  for a two week course on continuing education about how to use the diagnostic tool of a CT scan.
[01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:20.200]  It's a fucking scam people. It's a fucking scam. I'm sorry. That's my one.
[01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:27.000]  It's, it's, it's awesome. It's super important. I really appreciate it. So many thoughts there.
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:32.280]  So many thoughts that are really important. And I, I really encourage everyone who's listening
[01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:35.560]  to this and people who are going to be tuning into it later.
[01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:41.090]  Shit, we can't hear you.
[01:07:42.770 --> 01:07:44.770]  On how we're defining ourselves.
[01:07:45.730 --> 01:07:46.850]  Say that again, Kelly.
[01:07:47.010 --> 01:07:47.970]  Say that again, Kelly.
[01:07:47.970 --> 01:07:52.850]  Why is it we're defining ourselves off of information that somebody else has told us,
[01:07:52.850 --> 01:07:57.250]  and then all of a sudden it becomes, I don't know if you guys can still hear us.
[01:07:58.370 --> 01:07:59.330]  Yeah, we can hear you now.
[01:08:00.690 --> 01:08:08.450]  Okay, cool. Is where we're defining ourselves off of a scientific experiment. We're defining
[01:08:08.450 --> 01:08:15.570]  ourself off of what somebody told us. And then we're like sticking to it. And we're
[01:08:15.570 --> 01:08:21.330]  going to live out our lives off of this definition that was had off of this one time. And we're
[01:08:21.330 --> 01:08:39.800]  going to play out that role. We're dynamic beings in nature ever can change our mind at any time.
[01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:43.720]  We don't have to.
[01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:48.120]  Are we glitching?
[01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:51.880]  A little bit. Yeah, there you go. Perfect.
[01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:55.800]  Can you hear? Sorry.
[01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:58.040]  Maybe we'll turn our camera off here for a second.
[01:08:59.240 --> 01:08:59.880]  Can you hear us?
[01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:06.120]  Okay, cool. Sorry about that, everyone. So what I was just saying is that I think it's
[01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:15.080]  really great for us to define ourselves off of our own power, off of our own health and
[01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:22.040]  well-being, off of what makes us feel good, rather than holding on to somebody else's dogma
[01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:28.200]  of society. And then people feel like, well, if I was believing in that for so long, well,
[01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:34.440]  now I've defined myself as that belief. And I can't even change my mind, because society doesn't
[01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:40.360]  really even allow me to change my mind. We're dynamic individuals, we can change our mind at
[01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:47.320]  any time. We can be fully entrenched in a belief and then learn something the next day
[01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:53.400]  and realize that whatever we were entrenched in is not what we want to be entrenched in any longer.
[01:09:54.120 --> 01:10:00.040]  That's part of becoming healthy. That's part of becoming powerful. It's part of becoming,
[01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:06.920]  you know, like, I truly believe that when we become incarnated into our bodies and into this life,
[01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:13.480]  that we make soul commitments off of the work that we're going to do in this life. We make
[01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:19.000]  soul commitments off of the energy and the essence that we're going to leave on this planet.
[01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:26.840]  And I believe that so many people have lost their way off of their own soul commitment,
[01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:33.400]  because they're believing and defining themselves off of somebody else's stupid soul commitment.
[01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:39.160]  I think it's very important that we do our own meditation and that we go within our own selves
[01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:45.160]  to recognize what was the soul commitment that I made here. And why is it so important that I
[01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:51.960]  fulfill the soul commitment? Because when we're following our own soul commitment, and we're
[01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:59.240]  following our own life's processes and what makes us feel good, then we become a beneficial part of
[01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:03.400]  then we become a beneficial part of this collective consciousness.
[01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:11.000]  Then we truly become a health and well being of this collective consciousness. We know that
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.720]  become a super T cell of this consciousness.
[01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:21.000]  Yeah, or you become a beneficial protozoa that colonizes, and then can change the entire soil
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.200]  bed within a week.
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:26.280]  Maybe they don't colonize, maybe they propagate, just to choose a better word.
[01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:34.280]  Yeah. And I just think that, you know, so many, so many people are bound right now,
[01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:41.960]  especially in rhetoric and in information that has been given by other people that it doesn't
[01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:49.240]  necessarily even feel good within themselves. Now people are just angry for following something that
[01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:56.120]  they don't even maybe even truly believe in, nor is it part of their soul path. That goes along
[01:11:56.120 --> 01:12:00.520]  with everything that goes along with your choices of the food that you eat every day. It goes along
[01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:03.560]  with the people that you choose to surround yourself with every day.
[01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:12.280]  And people talk about, oh, you can't cure, you know, the actual chronic illness,
[01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:19.400]  but you can work with the symptoms. So living your life every day, realizing that there's no
[01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:27.480]  guarantees in life and recognizing that really you have to do your best to just realize that
[01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:32.840]  every day is a blessing and that you have to try and make your relationships matter.
[01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:40.600]  You have to try because we're all trying. And every day is a part of your wellness program.
[01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:44.040]  So maybe you can't do everything. Maybe you're in the middle of the city,
[01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:49.640]  maybe you're in an apartment, we don't know where you are, but maybe you can do one or two
[01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:55.400]  new things now, now that you know that there's no guarantees in life and now that you know that
[01:12:55.400 --> 01:13:03.080]  really the power is in your hands. And historically, healers that have figured out how to heal people
[01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:10.520]  often become ostracized. Doctors, as soon as they go outside the paradigm, they become ostracized.
[01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:20.520]  So important for us all to become the doctor and all of us to become the teacher and all of us to
[01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:24.520]  work on empowering ourselves. Empower each other.
[01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:33.720]  I love the YouTube movie Forbidden Cures. And they talk about Ruth Case from Canada and Ontario.
[01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:39.320]  And her last name is Case. But if you put it backwards, it's Essiac and the Essiac T.
[01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:43.640]  She cured thousands and thousands and thousands of people from cancer.
[01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:49.160]  Well, she didn't cure people. The herbs cured the people. This is what we need.
[01:13:56.520 --> 01:14:02.680]  The person is not the mentor, the herbs are the mentor. And the person is just a guide.
[01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:04.200]  Just a guide.
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:09.880]  All right, shut your feet off.
[01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:14.760]  She was a wise man healer and go ahead.
[01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:16.920]  There you go.
[01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:21.720]  Okay. Are we good now?
[01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:22.120]  Okay.
[01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:22.760]  You're good.
[01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:28.040]  And then of course, the Gerson therapy. Amazing. You know, the Gerson miracle,
[01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:38.840]  which is flood your body with vegetables and juice and nutrients. Do a coffee enema once a day
[01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:45.160]  and take micronutrients and trace minerals and stuff to support your biome. That's how you
[01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:53.480]  transform your disposition. Now, they had to go to Mexico, right? So there's no place in the world
[01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:58.360]  that's the right place. So you might have to go the extra mile, but these things are online.
[01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:02.360]  And what he's saying by they had to go to Mexico is that the FDA
[01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:12.600]  is not allocating healthy practices for patients. What they allocate is pharmaceutical companies
[01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:17.480]  and their pharmaceutical curatives. Now let's talk about that for a second. Again,
[01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:21.720]  when we talk about patient studies, I hear it now everywhere. My whole life,
[01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:27.240]  30 years has been about patient studies. Now everybody's talking about patient studies and
[01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:37.320]  allopathic studies, doctors and scientific research groups are not given money for patient
[01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:44.520]  studies or peer review studies. Unless there is going to be a product at the end.
[01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:53.640]  I can say that again. You will not receive money for any kind of a research and development for
[01:15:53.640 --> 01:16:01.800]  health and wellbeing of the human, even or of animals, unless there's a product pharmaceutical
[01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:08.360]  at the end. So if they're going to give us millions of dollars to run a peer review study
[01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:15.720]  and in the end of it, we find out that the immune system is actually the curative.
[01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:21.240]  There's no money in that. They don't want to find out that the immune system is not part of that.
[01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:25.720]  So all of the funders that gave all of their money towards that peer review study,
[01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:32.520]  they're pissed off because all they did was give money towards a curative. They didn't give money
[01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:40.440]  towards getting money back. So we need to start recognizing what peer review means,
[01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:46.520]  what scientific evidence and research truly means. And if you follow the money,
[01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:54.280]  then you find out what the end result was because it goes back to the money.
[01:16:55.240 --> 01:17:02.040]  And sure, this is all really cliche and it's easy to say, but when we start truly incorporating
[01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:11.320]  these ideologies and these falsities into our everyday lives, you realize that
[01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:19.160]  the bowl of cereal that you're eating was probably a peer review study
[01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:26.040]  and cost millions of dollars from a pharmaceutical company. And the reason why that got funded
[01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:31.480]  is because it has a whole myriad of pharmaceuticals inside of it as preservatives.
[01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:39.480]  So you realize the same as fertilizers. So anything that has all of these scientific
[01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:43.320]  evidence based on it and everybody wants to say, well, scientific evidence,
[01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:49.880]  right there is the time to walk out the door. It's the same as any doctor who says to you,
[01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:57.560]  I can cure you. You walk out the door. The only thing that can cure you is you.
[01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:10.120]  Nobody can cure you. Nobody can be a mentor to give you information unless you uptake it.
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:20.520]  It's the same with plants. You can't just give them some idea. You have to give them something
[01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:26.920]  to work with within the soil so then they can gain their own endophytic intelligence in the
[01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:33.160]  same way that we gain our own microbiology, microbiome intelligence. And like the fecal
[01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:35.800]  implants are- Which I love this topic.
[01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:44.680]  Yeah. It's only like one or 2% of humans on earth that even have the intact biome enough to create-
[01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:45.640]  To be a host.
[01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:54.520]  Implant. It's also why using soil from a different environment and bringing it into your environment
[01:18:54.520 --> 01:19:02.200]  makes sense. So it's like a fecal implant. You're seeding nature soil into your grow environment.
[01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:09.880]  And you're hoping that there's enough raw materials in your soil to continue the diversity
[01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:17.480]  of life that you brought in through indigenous microorganisms. And it doesn't truly make sense
[01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:24.120]  to grow indigenous microorganisms onto rice to then put it in your soil because you lose
[01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:28.440]  stuff to be right there. So what you're trying to do is take the feed that the soil in its full
[01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:34.920]  intactness and bring that back into your soil environment and grow it through raw materials.
[01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:43.720]  The fecal implant comes in and in your body has to be prepared for it to enable for it to grow.
[01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:50.440]  So the food that you're eating every day, the detoxing that you're doing every day,
[01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:54.520]  maybe it's activated charcoal, maybe it's bentonite clay.
[01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:55.800]  And I could jump in here.
[01:19:55.800 --> 01:19:58.840]  Maybe it's psyllium husk, you know, and go ahead.
[01:19:58.840 --> 01:20:03.080]  And I could jump in here really quick. What Josh said is that I've worked with many,
[01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:09.240]  many patients in fecal implants. I think that fecal implants are absolutely imperative
[01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:15.720]  in healing the microbiome from all of the case studies, peer review and education that got us
[01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:22.200]  to here, which is a totally destroyed microbiome. And we continue to have generations of children
[01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:26.760]  with a destroyed microbiome because we know it comes from our blood brain barrier during child
[01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:32.680]  birth. And I also want to integrate here now over 50 percent of childbirths on the planet now are
[01:20:32.680 --> 01:20:39.000]  being born in an isolated venture through cesarean section that takes away microbiome as well.
[01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:47.320]  But I wanted to say about the fecal implant is that when I'm working with patients in doing
[01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:56.760]  fecal implants, if their body is so toxified out, if they have so many pathogens that they could
[01:20:57.640 --> 01:21:05.560]  do a fecal implant through an enema and as soon as it even hits their microbiome,
[01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:10.280]  it will be consumed by all of the pathogens that are inside of that human body.
[01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:21.080]  So in a fecal implant, just like in turning over a soil from a synthetic garden, you have to do it
[01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:31.160]  slowly. That person has to start having a diet which helps replicate very beneficial microbiology,
[01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:36.280]  beneficial cell regrowth for at least three months.
[01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:43.000]  Or whatever inside your intestine is like the fungal hyphae and the fungal filaments.
[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:48.440]  Yeah, because it will be attacked immediately. So this really is no different. And when we're
[01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:56.200]  trying to turn over our gardens to organic and to natural soils, it's the same as our body being
[01:21:56.200 --> 01:22:02.920]  turned over to natural capabilities and getting our body kickstarted in it. I like to have my
[01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:10.520]  patients on a three-month diet that they're working towards beneficial microbiology, wiping
[01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:17.320]  out a lot of those yeast that can instantly consume the fecal implant. So therefore, you go
[01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:23.320]  through all of the energy and effort just like somebody would in a garden. They're going to turn
[01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:27.400]  over everything. They're going to buy everything. And they're going to really make the energy and
[01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:34.120]  effort. I just encourage them just like a fecal implant is to take time because that time is going
[01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:40.920]  to be the integrated mental energy as well as the physical energy that you have or your soil
[01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:47.080]  microbiology has to be able to uptake beneficials when they come out. And while you're taking that
[01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:56.600]  time, you can design the environment that you live in to make it that same reflection. So then when
[01:22:56.600 --> 01:23:03.160]  you walk outside, you see your garden, you see your piece of land, and you see this regenerative
[01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:12.120]  polyculture, unbelievably dynamic ecosystem. And now it's representing what you're doing to your
[01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:20.840]  body. And that will save the world. That is what repopulates the environment with goodness.
[01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:30.120]  But the viruses and pathogens are the largest organism on earth. There's more viruses in the
[01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:40.280]  virome on earth than anything else. So of course, viruses are fodder for beneficial bacteria. So
[01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:48.680]  in your true power, in your true, in that idea of that perfect place, you should be able to consume
[01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:55.080]  any pathogen that comes your way. Of course, that's the purpose of regenerative farming.
[01:23:55.080 --> 01:24:02.760]  That's the purpose of regenerative herbalism or wise women or medicine, men healers. That's the
[01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:10.440]  purpose of it. It's timeless. It never changes. It doesn't. It's the one constant that we have
[01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:16.920]  just because the designer name of the virus has changed. Doesn't mean the interaction that the
[01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:24.120]  human body has with it. Protect your mitochondria and your cells through health and wellbeing
[01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:34.840]  and regenerative farming. And that's your best hope. We have 380 trillion, trillion
[01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:46.520]  pathogens inside of every cell, 380 trillion. That number is absolutely astounding.
[01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:56.200]  So that means you have every, uh, pathogen and variation of illness, every variation of sickness,
[01:24:56.200 --> 01:24:59.800]  every villain, variation of health and wellbeing, all living in your cells.
[01:25:00.520 --> 01:25:07.560]  When you become out of balance, just like when your garden becomes out of balance or stressed,
[01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:14.520]  it expresses illness or it expresses maladies that it already had.
[01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:22.520]  Or it attracts the pest or it attracts a friend that's toxic or it attracts something that's
[01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:29.240]  there to break you or it down. But you, you protecting yourselves is giving you the ultimate
[01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:35.720]  strength. You know, a perfect example of this is when I work with patients and I get them on a diet
[01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:40.920]  and they tell me at the very beginning, that soup that you had me make was really gross.
[01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:47.000]  Like I didn't even like it. I don't even know how I'm going to even eat. Well, I talked to them
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:54.520]  eight months later and they are just going off about all of the flavors in the soup and the
[01:25:54.520 --> 01:26:02.680]  carrots taste amazing. And I got this head of cabbage that has so much flavor. It's because
[01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:11.560]  that body is now starting to recognize the over amount of pathogens that were dulling down the
[01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:21.560]  senses, dulling down the choices that people make just in order to keep that biology living.
[01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:29.480]  Now, when you wake up in the morning and you crave a Snickers bar, is it truly your higher being and
[01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:37.240]  your soul path craving it? Or is it the unbeneficial fungi and the pathogens that have
[01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:45.240]  totally colonized and taken over by the practices that you have every day? Now, this is the definition
[01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:55.960]  of illness and wellness. It's our own choices. Anyone can break out in a staphylococcus infection
[01:26:55.960 --> 01:27:01.560]  because we all have staphylococcus inside of our body. It can be found anywhere. It's part of the
[01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:09.960]  human biome. You don't just pick it up somewhere. You can be in an environment that breeds that
[01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:17.560]  and that makes you stressed and maybe even has temperatures or humidity that will help that
[01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:25.160]  colonize and bloom and grow for sure. But the reason why it's colonizing and blooming and
[01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:32.120]  growing is because you already have been hosting an environment for that to be able to live in,
[01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:39.560]  or you've already been hosting pathogens inside of your soil for a very long time. So when people say,
[01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:47.400]  hey, I'm having some problems in my garden, you already had problems in your garden and now your
[01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:53.800]  plants are showing it. When people become symptomatic, they already had problems in their
[01:27:53.800 --> 01:28:01.160]  body and now they're finally showing it. What would it be like if all of a sudden we turned around
[01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:08.520]  and we were symptomatic when people are symptomatically showing that you're getting better?
[01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:15.720]  So when somebody starts to have a cough and a cold and has a fever, we all celebrated and said,
[01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:20.600]  oh my God, you're finally becoming symptomatic. Your body is finally healing itself.
[01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:25.320]  It's like when you're at an ayahuasca ceremony and you're throwing up, they call it being well.
[01:28:25.480 --> 01:28:31.880]  Yeah. And that's when you feel the worst is because you're finally getting well. Your body
[01:28:31.880 --> 01:28:38.760]  is finally exuding all of that gross stuff out of it, or your gardens are finally showing you,
[01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:44.040]  your plants are finally showing you what's been happening inside of your soil the whole time.
[01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:50.920]  And then the ganja says, oh, I'm fractal ganja. I can do anything. Oh wow. I have an incredible
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:57.320]  I have an incredible diverse soil. Holy, I'm getting amazing energy from these humans. Watch
[01:28:57.320 --> 01:29:05.720]  this. Kabam. They make this incredible fusion right in front of you annually, every few three
[01:29:05.720 --> 01:29:12.280]  months. That is the kind of power we need to focus on. That's exciting. It's empowering. It's
[01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:19.640]  uplifting. It gives us strength. It breathes into our lungs. It makes us wake up the next day.
[01:29:19.640 --> 01:29:26.040]  It affects our dreams. Now, all of a sudden, we're getting help from the guides and spirits
[01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:32.200]  and the multi dimensions that we're a part of. I love the idea that when you look at one area
[01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:37.880]  and then a raven comes in and looks at the same garden or a deer comes in and looks at the same
[01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:44.520]  garden space, the raven's going to see a different visual. The deer is going to see a different
[01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:48.600]  visual. I'm going to stand there and see a different visual. But yet we're looking at
[01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:55.640]  the same thing. Which one is actually real or right? I don't see what the raven's seeing,
[01:29:55.640 --> 01:30:03.000]  but I can try and be in touch with the raven to say, oh wow, maybe there's some link there.
[01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:12.200]  So yeah, we're a part of that oneness. To me, that's powerful.
[01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:14.040]  And we've gone off for a while.
[01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:20.920]  That's what I love about you guys. It's beautiful. It's like listening to a symphony.
[01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:27.800]  So many levels and layers to it all. And again, why you guys are just such important people and
[01:30:28.760 --> 01:30:36.600]  deeply loved by so many. And I think that the way you express understanding
[01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:43.400]  the diversity of soil is so critical. I give this lecture a lot about what it was like to
[01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:51.400]  live here, say 3,000 years ago when the sky's darkened with migrations of ducks and birds.
[01:30:53.000 --> 01:31:00.760]  Entire savannas were ripped up by water buffalo that came in and trashed and trashed and pooped
[01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:09.240]  and moved on. And that critical inoculation that was occurring during those events that
[01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:20.760]  doesn't happen anymore. And getting those other tools or participants, the diversity, is just so,
[01:31:20.760 --> 01:31:29.400]  so important in rebuilding or rehabbing dirt back into soil. The natural environment,
[01:31:30.280 --> 01:31:35.560]  the natural farming movement, whether you're collecting it by rice or whether you're collecting
[01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:44.520]  it by actually taking a small sample of the soil back with you. Again, there's no perfect way. And
[01:31:44.520 --> 01:31:51.480]  I don't think that any one tool is the best tool. But by having all of these tools, you're going to
[01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:59.160]  be better off. And so is your environment. It drives me nuts when I get introduced to a client
[01:31:59.160 --> 01:32:05.320]  who's like, oh, yeah, I do my yoga, I meditate, and I eat all organic food. And then you see the
[01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:10.280]  lawn care company spreading fertilizer and pesticides, Roundup, on the dandelions. And it's
[01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:19.160]  like, you're missing the whole fucking point here. Your environment is a direct result of who you are.
[01:32:19.160 --> 01:32:27.000]  So whether you just put in good food and then live in a toxic environment, you're not going to get
[01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:33.480]  the benefits of all these other things that you're doing to try to improve yourself. And that
[01:32:33.480 --> 01:32:39.560]  goes back to the insanity of humanity, repeating the same things over and over again, expecting a
[01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:47.560]  new and different result. A little factoid here that I'm going to share, Brian, remember we talked
[01:32:47.560 --> 01:32:54.120]  a while back about the biometer and the work of Dr. Judith, her last name's slipping me now.
[01:32:54.840 --> 01:33:05.080]  I met her back at Rodale when I was studying down there under Elaine. And she came in as a
[01:33:06.280 --> 01:33:13.080]  freshly out of the pharmaceutical industry, and her job was to design tools for the pharmaceutical
[01:33:13.080 --> 01:33:21.000]  industry to test out their theories. And so she was trying to build this, she had heard James
[01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:27.960]  Sotillo talk at a soil convention, and had thought, well, you know, I should create a
[01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:35.080]  biometer, a way to measure the biology in soil. And I thought, oh my God, that would be amazing.
[01:33:35.080 --> 01:33:40.840]  I mean, I totally get having the microscope as a very valuable tool, but I'm looking at one
[01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:49.800]  drop of water out of one milligram of soil from an acre. What the fuck am I really going to learn
[01:33:49.800 --> 01:33:54.760]  here, right? So being able to have a biometer and walk around and stick it in the soil in different
[01:33:54.760 --> 01:34:01.640]  areas to really determine the overall health of the soil system would be way better tool to be
[01:34:01.640 --> 01:34:07.560]  than a microscope. So in our casual conversations, I told her about what had happened with my
[01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:16.120]  cousin's husband. And she laughed, because I said, hey, why can't I bring medical grade
[01:34:16.120 --> 01:34:23.320]  or pharmaceutical grade compost to the market? Because it would be just what a wonderful way to
[01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:31.000]  introduce the endophytic bacteria or biology, as well as all of the nutrients that that plant
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:36.440]  brought up. Remember going back to the mushroom, that mushroom is an expression of hundreds of
[01:34:36.440 --> 01:34:42.360]  years of pulling all of these nutrients and vitamins and secondary and tertiary metabolites
[01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:49.080]  out of the soil. And what a great delivery system that compost could actually be,
[01:34:49.080 --> 01:34:55.000]  whether it's under your fingernails, whether it's in your mouth, sublingual, an enema, whatever,
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:35:02.760]  bathing in it. What a great way to introduce that healthy biome back into our bodies. And she
[01:35:02.760 --> 01:35:10.200]  laughed at me and said, forget it. It cost the pharmaceutical industry $1 billion and probably
[01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:16.800]  10 to 20 years to bring a product to market. Nobody can compete.
[01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:24.960]  Well, and it also, it's also something that everyone can maybe do. The pharmaceutical
[01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:34.160]  industry wants to isolate. They want science, science, science, which is all isolating. And
[01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:42.080]  that isn't beneficial for them, for you to not need all of the other pharmaceuticals.
[01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:49.600]  So if we start aligning with nature and actually making people healthy,
[01:35:50.800 --> 01:35:55.360]  and that is for people to pretty much defy the education that they've been given, defy
[01:35:56.640 --> 01:36:02.800]  all education, question every single bit of it, and start aligning with nature,
[01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:08.400]  then you realize that there is no money in being healthy.
[01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:11.840]  Yep. Exactly.
[01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:20.640]  They, they go away. They go away like poof, they're gone. If everybody is fully empowered
[01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:27.680]  and powerful over their own health and wellness, then nobody is looking outside of themselves.
[01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:32.640]  Then everybody knows what's going on. And they're only looking within themselves and
[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:41.760]  their own community to heal themselves. That doesn't give power to the pharmaceutical industries.
[01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:47.440]  And when we don't give power to that, then we don't give power to fear. And when we don't
[01:36:47.440 --> 01:36:53.200]  give power to fear, then we give power to love. And there is no money in that.
[01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:54.800]  Amen to that.
[01:36:55.040 --> 01:37:01.200]  So, you know, it's unfortunate and it's super cliche. And also I wanted to say something that
[01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:06.640]  Josh said, not really to be funny, but we always all talk about saving the world and we need to
[01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:15.680]  really stop that. The world is just fine. We are saving humanity. We are saving the animals with
[01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:24.720]  which are under our care now as humans on this planet. So somehow we've taken the managerial
[01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:35.920]  position on so much on this planet, but the best thing that can happen to the world is if we leave.
[01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:45.520]  So, no, it is, the animals are going to go on and do amazing. So all of the things
[01:37:45.520 --> 01:37:51.840]  that we're trying to save is just pretty interesting is everything. It just,
[01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:55.840]  it's a crazy sick circle. You know where I'm going with this.
[01:37:55.840 --> 01:38:00.800]  Everything's possible. It's more about the consciousness. So humans are natural part of
[01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:06.240]  the environment as well. You know, it'd be nice if there was like a balanced, you know,
[01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:10.960]  consciousness to them, you know, as a whole. And I think that we're working on it.
[01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:17.840]  Yeah. And, you know, the collective consciousness is real. It's meaningful, you know,
[01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:23.200]  Leighton, I was telling you how I had that super powerful dream about Pauline. It was just
[01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:33.840]  so wonderful to visit with her again and see her outside of her body and in that collective
[01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:43.280]  consciousness of which we're all trying to get to in the best path and way that we can. And
[01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:52.480]  really all this language and all of the turmoil and all of the everything and the struggles and
[01:38:52.480 --> 01:38:59.120]  the tribulations that humanity goes through is really us trying to
[01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:07.760]  answer what happens to us after we're here. Or what is it that we're supposed to be doing
[01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:19.840]  while we're here? We've lost that ability. So every single person who has, who is connected
[01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:28.400]  to themselves and in that love space is connected to that part of the collective consciousness
[01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:32.720]  that gives us the focus on why we're here.
[01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:39.520]  Well, and again, they, by design, keep us so busy that no one has time to reflect.
[01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:45.360]  You know, that's the biggest thing I'm going to miss. You know,
[01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:50.400]  in all of the shit that I've been going through for the last few months,
[01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:55.760]  I've been asked, I don't know how many times, how are you doing? Right. How are you doing?
[01:39:55.840 --> 01:39:59.600]  And the answer is always, I'm doing okay. I'm hanging in there, you know,
[01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:04.720]  moving through the process. Well, on Monday I had someone text me, how do you feel?
[01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:13.040]  And at first I just kind of like, just put the phone down. I'm like, wait a minute, that's weird.
[01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:17.280]  And it just kind of resonated with me. And I started thinking about it. I'm like, well,
[01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:24.320]  how do I feel? How do I feel right now? Because I'm not addressing it. I'm, you know,
[01:40:25.200 --> 01:40:32.960]  just going through the motions of life. I'm not really feeling right. And so the first thing was,
[01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:40.480]  well, I'm not, I'm not lonely, but I am alone. And then it was, I'm not depressed,
[01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:46.640]  but I'm definitely really sad. And if I had to sum it up in one word, I would say, no,
[01:40:47.600 --> 01:40:57.360]  I'm just fucking numb. And the reason is because the relationship I had with Pauline was one where
[01:40:58.080 --> 01:41:03.840]  sure we had our ups and downs, but we had a communication that I don't know as I'm going
[01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:10.880]  to be able to find where we could talk about something negative like the virus,
[01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:18.160]  whether you believe it's manmade or not. We could talk about medical industry and not get angry and
[01:41:18.160 --> 01:41:26.080]  just go down this dark, dark hole till we're both completely depressed about the present condition
[01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:34.240]  that there's no way we can fucking change. And that's, that's going to be the problem. That's
[01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:41.520]  going to be something that I don't know is how to repair to be able to have that conversation
[01:41:41.520 --> 01:41:47.200]  because let's face it, you guys were surrounded by negativity. And like you said, you know,
[01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:51.600]  by making us live in fear, our bodies are stressed. They're not going to get healthy.
[01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:58.160]  They're the system just rolls on and on and on, mulls us down like freaking bowling pins.
[01:41:58.560 --> 01:42:06.080]  But to have a connection with another human on a level that is built on love and respect
[01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:13.520]  and appreciation for, for the journeys, you know, we, we both came together and in a very weird
[01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:20.560]  way, we met at a cacao ceremony where she was the guided meditator. I'm saying that right.
[01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:26.720]  And during the meditation, she came into my meditation, which was fucking bizarre. Like when
[01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:32.000]  I got out of it and I sat up and I looked at her, I was like, what just happened? And she said the
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:37.440]  same thing. So obviously the universe had connected us for different reasons, but then to learn about
[01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:43.680]  all of the paths, steps, work that she had done to get to that point and then vice versa, the same
[01:42:43.680 --> 01:42:50.560]  where, you know, I'd gone through so many different jobs. I went from being a carpenter to a design
[01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:59.280]  builder, to a stone fabricator, into soil biology. I mean, that's not a normal track of someone's
[01:43:00.160 --> 01:43:08.880]  occupations. And so we had this really unique bond that, that I don't know is again, that
[01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:15.280]  that's replaceable. And so I choose to not really engage in conversation with people because of that
[01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:23.600]  negativity. I don't want it. I don't want to be afraid or fear or think about the repercussions
[01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:29.280]  of what I leave behind for my children. You know, those are, you know, that's why I do the work I do
[01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:35.120]  is because I fear those repercussions. If somebody doesn't step up and do it, somebody doesn't have
[01:43:35.120 --> 01:43:43.760]  conversations like this. I fear that there is no hope. And so hence why I do it. It's just, again,
[01:43:45.680 --> 01:43:55.680]  it's going to be difficult to, to carry on with, without her as, as a sounding board,
[01:43:56.240 --> 01:44:06.480]  as a place of refuge, a place of love and light in these crazy fucking times. You know, this is,
[01:44:06.480 --> 01:44:12.880]  this is just fucking insanity. That in the last two years, they shut the fucking world down over
[01:44:13.600 --> 01:44:22.400]  a virus. We've co-existed and co-evolved with viruses since the dawn of fucking time. And yet
[01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:27.760]  now we don't have a flu anymore. And the same amount of people are dying from the virus as did
[01:44:27.760 --> 01:44:40.000]  the flu in 19, 2019. And so this is like a paradigm shift of, of fear that is beyond comprehension or
[01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:46.720]  beyond, was beyond my comprehension prior to that. And then my craziest, wildest nightmares
[01:44:46.720 --> 01:44:54.000]  would have thought that humanity would get to a point where not only like you've said, Kelly,
[01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:58.480]  we've, we've, we've evolved to the point where now we don't have a choice, but we have to be the
[01:44:58.480 --> 01:45:03.920]  steward because if we're not the steward, we're going to frigging wipe ourselves out very quickly,
[01:45:03.920 --> 01:45:11.760]  regardless of whether it's a virus or a plague or anything else. We're, we're on a bullet train
[01:45:11.760 --> 01:45:17.520]  to fucking hell right now. We just keep shitting on the planet all over the place and we allow
[01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:22.400]  big business to, to pollute the environment with no consequences. As a matter of fact,
[01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:25.920]  if you've come down here to Southern California, you can see abandoned power plants,
[01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:34.000]  abandoned oil derricks. These guys made billions of dollars and they just walked away from shit
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:43.200]  and left it here to rot and to pollute the waterways and the oceans. It's just,
[01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:50.800]  it's staggering. And I, and I'm sorry I went on that rant, but you know, I, I felt it was necessary.
[01:45:51.440 --> 01:45:58.480]  Yeah. Well, I wanted to go back to what you were just talking about with Pauline and,
[01:45:59.200 --> 01:46:05.200]  you know, if we're talking about microbiology and we're talking about aligning, you know,
[01:46:05.920 --> 01:46:11.520]  with people and that the five people who surround us are the most like us, well, it's not just
[01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:18.000]  that they're like us or the people that we live with, the people that we, you know, share
[01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:29.760]  energy and conversations. You know, Pauline and you created the two of you.
[01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:41.520]  There's a creation there, an entity. And now who has lost a partner, a true love,
[01:46:42.080 --> 01:46:50.400]  understands that when that person passes out of their body, whether it's addressed or not
[01:46:50.400 --> 01:47:03.840]  in society, they're losing. You have lost a part of yourself. You have lost what has made you whole.
[01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:13.040]  And anyone out there who knows and understands this, for some reason, society doesn't allow that.
[01:47:13.760 --> 01:47:21.280]  Like on a biological level, that truly is happening on a mitochondria level. It's happening
[01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:31.040]  when we share energy and space with another human being like that. So the emptiness and
[01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:41.280]  that vibration is no different than a live wire that's been cut,
[01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:46.240]  that has to figure out how is it going to tuck itself back in.
[01:47:48.800 --> 01:47:57.600]  It's a circuit that's live. And you're the living part. And those of us out there who have lost
[01:47:57.760 --> 01:48:05.600]  somebody, a partner or a child, understands that that's like a loose circuit. And
[01:48:07.360 --> 01:48:16.640]  the beautiful remedy of this is that everything that the two of you created
[01:48:17.440 --> 01:48:24.560]  in creating a closed loop circuit, in creating health and vitality, in creating love,
[01:48:24.800 --> 01:48:40.160]  is also created within yourself. So all of the work that you've done up until this point
[01:48:41.200 --> 01:48:45.840]  with Pauline is the work that you've done with yourself. All of those people out there who have
[01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:52.080]  lost a loved one and who have even had the capability to love that person
[01:48:53.360 --> 01:49:02.560]  is sharing a closed loop circuit. But it can't happen unless the two circuits are full and whole
[01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:13.600]  already. So you have all of the capabilities to find this. Of course, it's not as fun without
[01:49:13.600 --> 01:49:20.080]  Pauline. Of course, it's not as fun without her in this embodiment. And all of those people who
[01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:27.440]  are listening who have lost a loved one, it's not the same. But it can reach a different level
[01:49:28.720 --> 01:49:38.640]  that is actually higher. The focus and the evolution then now is laid out for the collective
[01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:42.800]  consciousness. So that truly means the work that we do for the love of ourself
[01:49:43.680 --> 01:49:48.640]  truly heals the collective consciousness. So when we want to go into despair and we want to
[01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:53.600]  recognize that the whole world is in fear and the whole world is having a hard time,
[01:49:54.800 --> 01:50:04.400]  I just really challenge everybody to go within or to go without and find those relationships
[01:50:04.400 --> 01:50:08.800]  that is going to help heal all of us because it's not lost yet.
[01:50:10.960 --> 01:50:16.960]  And you know that because even though Pauline has passed out of her body, the love is not lost.
[01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:25.040]  The goodness and the essence and the power and the energy towards everything that humanity is
[01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:33.600]  positive in is all still there. Even though all of the environment is toxic, it's all still there.
[01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:34.640]  Go ahead, Lee.
[01:50:35.360 --> 01:50:39.120]  I love what you said. I thank you. And I know the energy still lives on in me.
[01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:47.520]  You can feel it and little things that happen, but it's the interaction.
[01:50:48.320 --> 01:50:58.400]  You know, that's the painful one, just physical. And I know what they say, time heals,
[01:50:59.120 --> 01:51:06.080]  but it doesn't. I guess I'm still in a very early phases and stages of this shit.
[01:51:06.080 --> 01:51:12.640]  And it's just hard sometimes, you know. And again, thank you for those beautiful words and thank you
[01:51:12.640 --> 01:51:19.280]  for all the things that you do and the important work that you do because those are, like you said,
[01:51:20.160 --> 01:51:26.240]  the connections, the electricity that still flows, the electrons and protons.
[01:51:27.760 --> 01:51:33.920]  And that is energy. So I appreciate that. I appreciate your words, Kelly. And,
[01:51:33.920 --> 01:51:37.840]  you know, again, much love and respect to you guys for all the things that you've been doing.
[01:51:42.240 --> 01:51:45.680]  There's people out there that want to kind of know how to heal themselves.
[01:51:46.400 --> 01:51:50.960]  Some of the easier ways is kind of through fasting and that kind of stuff. Do you guys
[01:51:50.960 --> 01:51:56.800]  mind kind of talking about what goes on when you do decide to go without, like you had just kind
[01:51:56.800 --> 01:52:03.120]  of mentioned? I thought that was a good metaphor for what it seems like if you are wanting to
[01:52:03.120 --> 01:52:09.120]  better yourself, then you need to find ways to go without, find discipline. Fasting seems like one
[01:52:09.120 --> 01:52:17.520]  of those things where you can kind of restart the gut microbiome as long as you're feeding it the
[01:52:17.520 --> 01:52:21.680]  correct foods. And it also seems like you have to have that right mindset. And that's something that
[01:52:21.680 --> 01:52:27.920]  I've just discovered within these last few years, really focusing on the mindset and on a daily
[01:52:27.920 --> 01:52:33.840]  aspect so that you don't lose track of, like, you know, if you're kind of just stoned and kind of
[01:52:33.840 --> 01:52:39.520]  going through life, a couple of days go by and it seems like life just flows. But when I've been
[01:52:39.520 --> 01:52:45.440]  focused daily, focused on things, making sure I'm achieving things, life seems a little bit longer
[01:52:45.440 --> 01:52:50.880]  for me. That's something that I've missed because it does feel like the older you get, that life
[01:52:50.880 --> 01:52:57.600]  just kind of speeds up. And maybe kill your video so you come through loud and clear.
[01:52:57.600 --> 01:53:02.240]  That it's really easy to get caught in our patterns because that's why they call them
[01:53:02.240 --> 01:53:07.280]  patterns, you know, and that's why you get caught in them because it's a pattern that you create.
[01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:14.640]  And sometimes just breaking yourself of that pattern, which is just every day. So it might be
[01:53:14.640 --> 01:53:21.680]  too hard for somebody to just start fasting or start cleansing, but it's not too hard for them
[01:53:21.680 --> 01:53:27.520]  to get out of their house for two days and go do something different. And in those two days,
[01:53:28.240 --> 01:53:35.040]  make a journal or goals on what they're going to change when they go back. So any kind of a
[01:53:35.040 --> 01:53:42.480]  small disruption of your patterning can be so helpful. Josh and I have been doing a lot of lives
[01:53:44.080 --> 01:53:50.480]  on Instagram because just what you were asking, Brian, and people are coming on and asking in
[01:53:50.640 --> 01:53:58.320]  my feed and people coming on our Discord channel too, is that it is absolutely the focus now.
[01:53:59.040 --> 01:54:04.880]  We can go into a room of so many people and it is always getting back to health and wellness
[01:54:05.520 --> 01:54:12.720]  of ourselves and of the human race and ourselves in our own heart space. It's like the soil is
[01:54:12.720 --> 01:54:19.840]  totally related, but it was almost like the cannabis was the gateway and then the soil
[01:54:19.840 --> 01:54:25.520]  was the gateway. And now we're finally at the root of what we really need to be addressing and
[01:54:25.520 --> 01:54:30.800]  talking about, which is health and wellness, because then any of the choices and the patterning
[01:54:30.800 --> 01:54:39.600]  that we do from that space or from that very solid foundation is inevitably going to be of beneficial
[01:54:40.480 --> 01:54:47.600]  output. I would also just suggest taking an assessment of your current situation.
[01:54:48.240 --> 01:54:53.760]  Just take a moment, take an assessment of your current situation. In that assessment,
[01:54:54.560 --> 01:55:02.560]  recognize that no one has it all figured out and no one's, say, farther along than anyone.
[01:55:03.200 --> 01:55:10.160]  And it's never too late to start your day over and it's never too late to make a change and it's
[01:55:10.160 --> 01:55:18.160]  never the wrong time. So just recognize that it's not the ending point, it's the journey. So
[01:55:18.960 --> 01:55:25.680]  any person can do something to change and it doesn't have to be that you have to be a certain
[01:55:25.680 --> 01:55:34.240]  person or in a certain place to make change. Just assess your current situation and work on a
[01:55:34.240 --> 01:55:42.240]  couple of things that you can do. And maybe the first thing to recognize is your food intake.
[01:55:43.280 --> 01:55:51.120]  What food are you eating? Is it processed out of a package or is it coming from a whole food? Is it
[01:55:51.120 --> 01:55:59.200]  coming from, you know, not Whole Foods Market, but from Whole Foods, right? Like from squash or
[01:55:59.200 --> 01:56:08.960]  potatoes or whatever and juices because that very thing will change your body. So next year, water,
[01:56:08.960 --> 01:56:14.160]  where is your water coming from? Can you get to a cleaner water source for your daily drinking?
[01:56:15.120 --> 01:56:22.000]  Can you put a filter on your shower? You know, those things where you're covering your body
[01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:32.240]  every single day and low grade chemicals, they add up. So what ways can you start to detoxify
[01:56:32.240 --> 01:56:40.160]  some of those chemicals out of your life in order to rebuild your skin flora or maybe your
[01:56:40.160 --> 01:56:47.520]  internal gut microbiome? Maybe it's breath work because right now a lot of people have to wear
[01:56:47.520 --> 01:56:54.000]  masks. It's unfortunate. So if you have to wear a mask or you think you do or whatever,
[01:56:54.000 --> 01:57:02.080]  it's going to maybe be double important for you to go find fresh air somewhere because the body
[01:57:02.080 --> 01:57:10.960]  can't function properly without enough air. So breath work, maybe it's 20 minutes a day and it's
[01:57:10.960 --> 01:57:14.720]  part of a meditation. You can decide whatever meditation you want to do.
[01:57:14.720 --> 01:57:21.920]  And there's so many, like we could go on and on and on about different things that people could
[01:57:22.720 --> 01:57:32.960]  make easy little changes in their daily lives. But the real message is here is if you have control
[01:57:32.960 --> 01:57:42.880]  over it, then make the change. Things that you don't have control over, look at it in a different
[01:57:42.880 --> 01:57:51.680]  way. That's really it. If we have control over it, make the changes. And if you don't,
[01:57:52.400 --> 01:58:00.800]  see it some way else. Because when we look at it in a different way, then we realize that no matter
[01:58:00.800 --> 01:58:08.160]  like Josh said, when you're, it's never too late to start your day again or to start over. And it's
[01:58:08.160 --> 01:58:18.160]  also never too late to realize that every single bit of who you are got you to this point in you
[01:58:18.160 --> 01:58:25.920]  making a change. And the very first thing to making a change is being thankful to yourself
[01:58:26.960 --> 01:58:32.480]  for doing all of those good things, harmful things, beneficial things, pathogen things,
[01:58:32.480 --> 01:58:41.440]  whatever things that you've done to get to this point to make a change that all of those things
[01:58:42.240 --> 01:58:48.560]  got you to this mindset. And we need to be thankful for it. And then that's where change
[01:58:48.560 --> 01:58:54.480]  can easily start happening rather than like, oh God, I'm so unhealthy. I can't even run,
[01:58:54.480 --> 01:59:01.040]  you know, a hundred meters. No problem. Be thankful to your body for getting yourself to that point
[01:59:01.040 --> 01:59:08.000]  to recognize that you need to run more than a hundred meters. You know, we need to be thankful
[01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:13.040]  for the maladies and discomforts and the terrible atrocities that have happened.
[01:59:13.040 --> 01:59:14.480]  Because they're showing you where you need to build.
[01:59:14.480 --> 01:59:20.720]  Because there are lessons. We need to own them. There are lessons and they brought us here.
[01:59:20.720 --> 01:59:27.680]  Even the deaths from, you know, they say from COVID or whatever are linked with other maladies. So the
[01:59:27.680 --> 01:59:34.000]  actual messages work on the maladies, you know, the general maladies. I would just add,
[01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:40.000]  you could go on forever, but I think just exercise and cardiovascular movement is something that a
[01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:46.480]  lot of people are missing in their life. And it also makes you breathe. So doing even jump roping
[01:59:46.480 --> 01:59:51.760]  is simple, you know, like just something to make your body move. And then also just plant medicine
[01:59:51.760 --> 01:59:58.400]  in general is very important. You know, maybe it's micro dosing, maybe it's macro dosing,
[01:59:58.400 --> 02:00:04.160]  full on heroic dosing, complete mind change, you know, in a correct environment with the right
[02:00:04.160 --> 02:00:11.360]  set. With a friend who loves you. Micro dosing changes lives, but macro dosing with the right
[02:00:11.360 --> 02:00:18.240]  guide and in the set and setting heroic doses will absolutely change your whole entire life
[02:00:18.240 --> 02:00:23.840]  immediately. So, you know, that's why plant medicine is there. And it's interesting that
[02:00:23.840 --> 02:00:30.560]  we're so happily we'll jump on a pharmaceutical round for our entire life, but we won't have,
[02:00:31.280 --> 02:00:35.840]  you know, a four hour journey within ourselves that we know that we're going to be fine with
[02:00:35.840 --> 02:00:41.680]  look within to look within. It's just so interesting yet again, on what we see as healing
[02:00:42.480 --> 02:00:47.440]  and what we see as curatives. I think that, you know,
[02:00:49.600 --> 02:00:57.440]  also, Josh and I have been having a ton of questions, like, our DMS and felt like hundreds
[02:00:57.440 --> 02:01:03.440]  and hundreds every day, it seems like with people asking health and wellness questions.
[02:01:04.160 --> 02:01:10.240]  So what we started doing was we just started doing lives on Instagram, and going on discord.
[02:01:11.120 --> 02:01:19.200]  And we're just sort of tackling a whole bunch at once, as well as we just did a whole group
[02:01:19.200 --> 02:01:25.440]  cleanse with definitely a couple hundred people. We all did it together, we're going to roll into
[02:01:25.440 --> 02:01:31.280]  a group meditation, and another cleanse for the fall. I mean, for the for the wintertime.
[02:01:32.320 --> 02:01:37.680]  And and then we'll do another spring cleanse. And that's really nice to do things with groups
[02:01:37.680 --> 02:01:45.120]  of people. So anyone can join in on the fun things that we're doing, and educating the community,
[02:01:45.120 --> 02:01:47.520]  and also participate in it. Yeah.
[02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:56.600]  You know, and I'd love to add one quick thing. No, you came off perfect. That was that was
[02:01:56.600 --> 02:02:02.680]  beautiful. And hopefully the audience will tap into your resources because you have been
[02:02:02.680 --> 02:02:08.840]  an incredibly huge pillar of the community for so long. And thank you for doing the work and
[02:02:08.840 --> 02:02:15.880]  continuing to do the work. Brian, here's a here's a little trick that Pauline did every morning is
[02:02:15.880 --> 02:02:22.360]  she got up and had her tea or coffee, whatever her drink was that morning. And she would quietly
[02:02:24.040 --> 02:02:29.560]  sit with herself and do what she said was a gratefulness prayer. So she would just go through
[02:02:29.560 --> 02:02:35.080]  her mind what she was grateful for. And by doing this, she would set the intention for the whole
[02:02:35.080 --> 02:02:41.480]  day. And when you do that, you find that other little things come into your life that are either
[02:02:41.480 --> 02:02:48.200]  beneficial or inspirational. They keep you going to keep you focused, they get you motivated to
[02:02:48.200 --> 02:02:55.000]  maybe take that walk or instead of just walking, you know, light run slow run. But that was that
[02:02:55.000 --> 02:03:00.440]  was something that I brought into my own practice. And I appreciate it because it definitely helps,
[02:03:00.440 --> 02:03:06.040]  especially on days where you're a little off, maybe it's a new moon, or, you know, maybe you
[02:03:06.040 --> 02:03:12.120]  got a piece of information or news that didn't jive well with you. But to just start your day
[02:03:12.120 --> 02:03:18.120]  with with appreciation for what you do have and not looking at, don't look at what you don't have.
[02:03:18.120 --> 02:03:24.600]  That is a great way to make, you know, monumental changes by starting with that little grain of sand.
[02:03:25.240 --> 02:03:28.360]  It always starts with something small. So hopefully that helps the audience.
[02:03:30.920 --> 02:03:38.600]  Yeah. And like you had mentioned, Kelly, the health is like at the top priority, it seems like
[02:03:38.600 --> 02:03:43.320]  whether you're poor, you have money, it seems like especially when it comes with gut issues.
[02:03:43.960 --> 02:03:48.680]  We've interviewed a few people on the show that have gone out of their way to share some of those
[02:03:48.680 --> 02:03:55.480]  issues. And this one gentleman was sharing, you know, to be honest, really candid with the audience
[02:03:55.480 --> 02:03:59.400]  and saying that when he would go to a party, like he'd have to know where the bathroom was,
[02:03:59.400 --> 02:04:05.480]  or if he went to certain locations, like you'd have to map it out and more than likely have to
[02:04:05.480 --> 02:04:12.200]  run over there at some point during that. I have never had issues at that level, but I've definitely
[02:04:12.200 --> 02:04:19.000]  felt where I've had like an inflamed gut or I just always felt off. And then when I started to focus
[02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:24.440]  on this, getting into more of the fasting, I forgot how good you can actually feel when your stomach
[02:04:24.440 --> 02:04:28.920]  feels great and the food that you're eating, you're actually digesting and absorbing the nutrients
[02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:33.880]  that you're trying to get in. So that was something I hope a gift, I feel like a community,
[02:04:33.880 --> 02:04:38.200]  we've been trying to promote that is bone broth, in your opinion, and then kind of
[02:04:38.200 --> 02:04:43.880]  fasting to autophagy. Is that part of that secret sauce? Do you guys kind of co-sign on that?
[02:04:43.880 --> 02:04:50.600]  Because the community is a little lost on what is what are the real benefits of fasting? And what
[02:04:50.600 --> 02:04:53.800]  are some of the hype things just to get you to click a YouTube?
[02:04:54.360 --> 02:04:59.960]  Well, I do recommend that people go on to our Instagram because we have, I think, four,
[02:05:00.680 --> 02:05:07.880]  four, one hour talks that Josh and I have done live on exactly the question that you're asking.
[02:05:08.440 --> 02:05:13.800]  And just to sort of, you know, not just push people there. I can also answer a few questions
[02:05:14.760 --> 02:05:27.080]  too, is that anything that feels healing that you put your goodness into like bone broth,
[02:05:27.080 --> 02:05:34.280]  like carrot juice, anything that is again, coming of nature is, is just super important.
[02:05:35.240 --> 02:05:47.080]  But it's also simplifying. So when we talk about cleansing, we're talking about not only
[02:05:47.080 --> 02:05:52.120]  simplifying the foods that we're putting in our body, but simplifying our life.
[02:05:53.800 --> 02:05:59.720]  And starting to maybe question how is it that we got here that things got so challenging and so
[02:05:59.720 --> 02:06:05.160]  difficult late night love, you know, waking up in the morning, we talk a lot about that,
[02:06:05.160 --> 02:06:11.560]  just being grateful, gratitude. We have other friends who have kids that have the washable
[02:06:11.560 --> 02:06:17.880]  erasable markers that all right on the refrigerator every day, a word of gratitude,
[02:06:17.880 --> 02:06:22.840]  and then the refrigerator is full up of all of the things they're grateful for. And then you just
[02:06:22.840 --> 02:06:29.080]  start realizing, for some reason, as a human species, when we're unwell, we have a tendency
[02:06:29.080 --> 02:06:37.880]  to focus on the unwellness. And that's part of the patterning we need to get out of and recognize
[02:06:37.880 --> 02:06:45.480]  that we could be focusing on the wellness because there's so much more of it. We are alive, we are
[02:06:45.480 --> 02:06:52.760]  functioning, we are well, we have capabilities to think and feel that way. And honestly, when we
[02:06:52.760 --> 02:07:00.520]  start breaking it down in that way, the goodness and the things that you should be doing come to
[02:07:00.520 --> 02:07:06.200]  you. It's great, you can have a mentorship of a group of people in a cleanse, which is awesome,
[02:07:06.200 --> 02:07:11.080]  because I love that it really helps me when I've got 200 other people, and we're all doing it
[02:07:11.080 --> 02:07:15.800]  together. And I'm just like, Okay, I'm gonna go it, I'm gonna really push, because I'm doing it
[02:07:15.800 --> 02:07:22.520]  with this big group of people that is super helpful. But also just like simplifying it down
[02:07:22.520 --> 02:07:27.640]  for yourself into what your needs are. And then you recognize, oh, I do actually need maybe a group
[02:07:27.640 --> 02:07:32.840]  of people. Or Oh, you know what, I've been a vegan for a really long time. And I'm gonna, I'm gonna
[02:07:32.840 --> 02:07:40.600]  be open to this bone broth thing. Because it resonates with me because somebody said it resonates
[02:07:41.080 --> 02:07:47.800]  or raw liver, or whatever, you know, all these different, you know, meat diets that are happening
[02:07:47.800 --> 02:07:54.360]  now. And I don't think there's one diet or one broth that works for everyone or for every ailment.
[02:07:54.360 --> 02:08:01.880]  I think that of course, bone broth is a really, really excellent base health thing to get into
[02:08:01.880 --> 02:08:07.880]  your body. But some people can't get good quality being vegan, and you don't want to use animals
[02:08:07.880 --> 02:08:14.680]  like that makes sense. I get it people, you know, need to go through that. And sometimes a person's
[02:08:14.680 --> 02:08:23.320]  body is stagnant from the overeating of corporate style meat. And sometimes you need to clear your
[02:08:23.320 --> 02:08:32.600]  body out from it. But regeneratively grown animals and meat are part of a healthy human diet. And
[02:08:32.600 --> 02:08:38.920]  it's more about the practice than it is about the actual, you know, compound that's going in. So when
[02:08:38.920 --> 02:08:47.240]  it we when it comes to diets, I think that we promote a whole a whole diet as much as possible.
[02:08:47.960 --> 02:08:55.400]  And, you know, I think that, you know, a high amount of plants in your diet make make a lot
[02:08:55.400 --> 02:09:00.760]  of sense. And you can see cows eat all plants, for example. So you can realize, you know,
[02:09:01.400 --> 02:09:06.360]  it doesn't mean you have to have meat, but meat can be a crucial part of a building
[02:09:07.240 --> 02:09:13.720]  part of your body. So I really want people to resonate with where it comes from and the
[02:09:13.720 --> 02:09:21.400]  practice that surrounds it. At the very least. Yeah, super important. And, and again, it goes
[02:09:21.480 --> 02:09:31.720]  into what we were talking about earlier is just releasing the dogma of what other people or other
[02:09:31.720 --> 02:09:39.000]  systems or other protocols have told you or what your education system has told you. And recognize
[02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:45.320]  that what your education has told you has come and come from a broken system also, that we need to
[02:09:45.320 --> 02:09:53.000]  reevaluate what health and well being is, that in these times, it's best not to be so dogmatic
[02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:59.640]  about one certain thing, but just be in a place of love and health and well being. And if you have
[02:09:59.640 --> 02:10:05.320]  to question it, if you have to question where your meat is coming from, then it's probably not good.
[02:10:05.960 --> 02:10:11.000]  If you have to question whether your actions are out of love or fear, it's probably going to be
[02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:16.520]  fear. So it's really nice for humanity to get to a place where we don't have to question
[02:10:17.160 --> 02:10:24.920]  what it is that we're constantly doing. And right now we're in a massive quandary cesspool. And the
[02:10:24.920 --> 02:10:30.760]  reason why we're in a massive quandary cesspool is because we're running off of fear. When we
[02:10:30.760 --> 02:10:37.160]  run off of love, we are not in quandary and we are not in a cesspool. And as far as so we always read
[02:10:37.240 --> 02:10:43.240]  the ingredients of what we're eating, right? We're one of those people that you read the
[02:10:43.240 --> 02:10:50.920]  ingredients of the food. And that's also part of the DEM peer certification. You have to know what
[02:10:50.920 --> 02:10:57.400]  your inputs are coming onto your farm. You have to check the toxicity of what's being inputted
[02:10:57.400 --> 02:11:03.560]  into your farm because the soil expresses those toxicities. We read the ingredients of the food
[02:11:03.560 --> 02:11:09.640]  going into our body because we know our body is going to express what's being given to it. When
[02:11:09.640 --> 02:11:14.680]  it comes to medicine, you should read the ingredients to know what's in it because that's
[02:11:14.680 --> 02:11:23.080]  going to express in your body. Things that are whole and nature don't have an ingredients list.
[02:11:24.040 --> 02:11:30.280]  You know you're safe there. If you're going to build your soil, you're going to look towards
[02:11:30.280 --> 02:11:34.840]  something in your environment that's going to be raw and break down. You're going to look for the
[02:11:34.840 --> 02:11:42.120]  closest food. When he talks about the mindset, every year, part of the year, you have a new
[02:11:42.120 --> 02:11:49.400]  thing to work on. Right now we're really excited about buying seeds or looking at the seeds that
[02:11:49.400 --> 02:11:55.000]  we have from this year. Part of our wellness in this time of year where it's dark and it's cold
[02:11:55.000 --> 02:12:03.480]  and there's snow outside, part of our meditation is designing our garden for this next year and
[02:12:03.480 --> 02:12:09.880]  getting all the seeds that we want for our biome. We're checking the amino acids that are going to
[02:12:09.880 --> 02:12:16.040]  turn into proteins. We're checking the color content of the food that we're buying. We're
[02:12:16.040 --> 02:12:24.600]  looking for ganja that's going to express in the medicine products that we're making this year.
[02:12:24.600 --> 02:12:30.600]  It's a lot to think about. While we're doing that, we're doing these exercises that help us
[02:12:30.600 --> 02:12:37.800]  be well. That's the stuff that we're working on right now. Everyone can do something in their
[02:12:37.800 --> 02:12:43.160]  environment to take advantage of where they're at and try and make it better. That's where
[02:12:43.160 --> 02:12:51.160]  winter going into spring is that time of making change. Just like my patient that I was talking
[02:12:51.160 --> 02:12:57.080]  about earlier that hated the veggie soup at the beginning, I told her the same thing that I'm
[02:12:57.080 --> 02:13:06.120]  going to tell a lot of you. Fake it. Fake it that you like it. If you don't want to get outside and
[02:13:06.120 --> 02:13:12.280]  you don't want to run around or you don't want to breathe the air, fake it. Because eventually your
[02:13:12.280 --> 02:13:16.760]  microbiome is going to catch up with you to where you actually really are stoked to go outside of
[02:13:16.760 --> 02:13:22.440]  the door, where you actually really are stoked to eat that whole veggie soup. Or the fermented food.
[02:13:23.640 --> 02:13:30.040]  Some people don't like the taste of fermented foods. Fake it. Well, your pathogen biome is
[02:13:30.040 --> 02:13:36.840]  telling you not to eat the fermented foods. Once you fake, oh, hey, okay, I'm going to eat it,
[02:13:36.840 --> 02:13:42.040]  or fish oil. I don't like the taste of Asian food. I don't like fish oil. Well, guess what? It's good
[02:13:42.040 --> 02:13:48.120]  for you. Fake it. Then you'll develop a taste for it because now all of a sudden your body's like,
[02:13:48.120 --> 02:13:55.320]  oh, wow, I get it. Now I want it. All of a sudden you open up a fish oil fermentation factory.
[02:13:55.320 --> 02:13:59.720]  And that goes along with negative talk too. When you're in a group of people,
[02:14:01.080 --> 02:14:08.120]  fake the conversation that if people want to talk about other people, which is such a low vibration,
[02:14:09.080 --> 02:14:14.520]  I want to be in conversations where we're talking about mind bending ideas that are just going to
[02:14:14.520 --> 02:14:22.040]  feed me on my soul path that I'm just so stoked that it's 2.30 in the morning and I just want
[02:14:22.040 --> 02:14:27.880]  more of that conversation rather than allowing the negative conversation.
[02:14:27.880 --> 02:14:30.920]  Degenerative conversations.
[02:14:30.920 --> 02:14:36.040]  Stop it right there. Nobody even wants to be in those conversations anyway.
[02:14:36.040 --> 02:14:37.080]  We want to take you higher.
[02:14:37.640 --> 02:14:43.160]  And everybody wants to take you higher. And another way to take you higher is to be growing
[02:14:43.160 --> 02:14:49.880]  the most beautiful, conscious flowers and cannabis. That's what the Future Cannabis
[02:14:49.880 --> 02:14:54.760]  Project is about. That's what you guys are all about. That's what we're all about, because we
[02:14:54.760 --> 02:15:03.480]  realize that looking for mentorship in human beings is flawed. But looking for mentorship
[02:15:04.040 --> 02:15:09.320]  in plants that have been grown by conscious human beings is the highest of high.
[02:15:10.680 --> 02:15:18.360]  So that's where we fit in to being totally conscious. And that's where we fit into creating
[02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.720]  cannabis that's going to hire the conversation.
[02:15:21.720 --> 02:15:30.040]  And ganja is part of the great awakening, this great reset, whatever it is. Ganja shows up
[02:15:30.680 --> 02:15:32.040]  every single time.
[02:15:32.360 --> 02:15:34.040]  She just keeps showing up.
[02:15:34.040 --> 02:15:36.440]  All of a sudden this week, really? COVID?
[02:15:36.440 --> 02:15:37.640]  Oh, hey.
[02:15:37.640 --> 02:15:39.640]  Well, it's already been proven numerous times.
[02:15:39.640 --> 02:15:41.000]  We already knew that.
[02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:48.840]  The cannabis is good for it, but it shows up every single time. Oh, clothing, cannabis.
[02:15:48.840 --> 02:15:50.200]  Oh, industry.
[02:15:50.200 --> 02:15:55.720]  Oh, we need to redo the soil, cannabis. Oh, wait, oils are bad for you. Canola is bad
[02:15:55.720 --> 02:15:57.320]  for you. GMO oils are bad for you.
[02:15:57.320 --> 02:15:57.880]  Cannabis.
[02:15:58.920 --> 02:15:59.560]  Oh, shit.
[02:15:59.560 --> 02:16:08.200]  Ganja. It's part of yoga. It's part of mental clarity. It's part of it.
[02:16:08.200 --> 02:16:08.920]  But it's not-
[02:16:08.920 --> 02:16:10.680]  It's not the only thing.
[02:16:11.320 --> 02:16:12.520]  Oh, shit. Sorry.
[02:16:12.520 --> 02:16:13.800]  Come on now, we're getting excited.
[02:16:13.800 --> 02:16:16.440]  I'm getting excited. I'm going to have a bong hit too, because we're talking so much about
[02:16:16.440 --> 02:16:16.600]  cannabis.
[02:16:16.600 --> 02:16:18.040]  Ganja is going crazy right now.
[02:16:20.360 --> 02:16:27.800]  The resin is there because it resonates with you. It resonates with the environment, the air,
[02:16:27.800 --> 02:16:39.000]  the phylosphere, the air microbiome, the rhizosphere, everything. The ganja shows up.
[02:16:39.560 --> 02:16:45.800]  So we need to show up and create the best environment for the cannabis to grow.
[02:16:45.800 --> 02:16:53.080]  And we don't need to know why. We just need to know that we have faith in-
[02:16:53.080 --> 02:16:54.840]  We have to grow the fire.
[02:16:55.080 --> 02:16:57.800]  We have faith in the resin.
[02:16:59.560 --> 02:17:09.240]  Because every single flower that you are cultivating is affecting somebody's entire
[02:17:09.960 --> 02:17:16.920]  life. And it's affecting other people's lives because that person might bring your bud
[02:17:17.720 --> 02:17:24.680]  into that conversation. And it is not going to even be you that changes that conversation.
[02:17:24.680 --> 02:17:30.040]  It's going to be that doobie that you pass around that's going to change the conversation
[02:17:30.680 --> 02:17:32.360]  that changes all of humanity.
[02:17:33.080 --> 02:17:39.800]  No longer are we talking about tit for tat bullshit when a fire joint goes around.
[02:17:40.760 --> 02:17:46.680]  All of a sudden now we're talking about things that are bringing the conversation higher.
[02:17:46.680 --> 02:17:53.480]  And if you grow indoors in a cannabis, in a ganja tent, and a 10 by 10 tent, you have four plants,
[02:17:54.120 --> 02:18:01.720]  you can take a copper wire and put that copper wire into the ground of your outlet on your house
[02:18:01.720 --> 02:18:06.280]  and you can ground your plants. And those plants will be healthier.
[02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:11.800]  Give thanks to Wade Laughter, who's having a hard time with his health at the moment.
[02:18:11.800 --> 02:18:15.480]  Wade Laughter from House of Harlequin, we love you.
[02:18:15.480 --> 02:18:19.640]  I'm going to have a smoke right now for Wade and anybody out there who's listening live.
[02:18:19.640 --> 02:18:25.400]  I just love for you all to put one up in the air for our brother Wade. And also,
[02:18:26.520 --> 02:18:33.880]  I would love for everyone to put one up in the air for Leighton and this broken heart that you're
[02:18:33.880 --> 02:18:39.720]  working on healing because you're so powerful and wonderful. But I just really want everybody
[02:18:39.720 --> 02:18:45.960]  because collective consciousness is so totally important. And we all know that we can heal each
[02:18:45.960 --> 02:18:52.520]  other through that. And Leighton, all of us love you so much. And Wade, all of us love you all so
[02:18:52.520 --> 02:18:57.640]  much. I'm Daniel from Lane Creek, who's part of our DEM Peer Certification, blessings on your
[02:18:57.640 --> 02:19:03.720]  spirit. On your path. And Pauline, we already knew that you were running. We don't need to bless
[02:19:03.720 --> 02:19:10.120]  Pauline on her path. Pauline, we thank you for being there for us on the spiritual realm and
[02:19:10.120 --> 02:19:16.600]  being there for a guide for us because we recognize you're there along with other spiritual guides
[02:19:16.600 --> 02:19:22.120]  to help us on our path. We appreciate you. I love you, Leighton.
[02:19:23.960 --> 02:19:31.400]  I love you, community. You guys are watching us because every person that's watching us is as
[02:19:31.400 --> 02:19:36.440]  powerful as the other person. They're all part of the microbiome. We're all part of the same
[02:19:37.560 --> 02:19:41.880]  essence, making the world a better place. Everyone out there, we love you.
[02:19:42.760 --> 02:19:45.000]  Truly. We need more of this community.
[02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:48.440]  This community has become something special. That is something that is very true.
[02:19:49.480 --> 02:19:56.440]  And I think you missed one thing, Josh, and that is the resin that binds us all together.
[02:19:57.400 --> 02:20:04.120]  And I think in many ways, this community is very well bound together on this understanding that
[02:20:04.120 --> 02:20:13.080]  this plant has the power to really redefine humanity if she's unleashed. And hopefully,
[02:20:13.080 --> 02:20:20.760]  the powers that be do eventually unleash her globally and not with their power and their
[02:20:21.240 --> 02:20:25.080]  positions, but free her once and for all.
[02:20:26.680 --> 02:20:36.660]  I think it's one of the most important messages is keep cannabis sacred.
[02:20:38.500 --> 02:20:49.700]  Keep cannabis and ganja medicinal. Part of the recreational legalization is to disassociate us
[02:20:50.660 --> 02:21:00.580]  from true herbalism, from true product making. Part of recreational, we like to say is spelt with
[02:21:01.380 --> 02:21:12.180]  W-R-E-C-K, recreational, because it wrecks the community that brought it to fruition to begin
[02:21:12.180 --> 02:21:18.100]  with. The reason why cannabis is open right now is because it was a medicinal product.
[02:21:18.100 --> 02:21:25.940]  Because it was a medicinal alternative to allopathic medicine that clearly did not work.
[02:21:27.140 --> 02:21:33.220]  The allopathic medicine of the day wasn't good enough and cannabis showed up at the time to
[02:21:33.220 --> 02:21:40.660]  become medicinal. And it's very important for us as we move forward and we see cannabis open up
[02:21:40.660 --> 02:21:49.300]  in the world, that we continue to step up for that evolution and create a natural space for it.
[02:21:49.300 --> 02:21:57.620]  It's not okay for it to be isolated and fractalized in that way. It's not the message,
[02:21:58.500 --> 02:22:02.660]  it's not the information that we've been given. The information that we've been given by the
[02:22:02.660 --> 02:22:11.620]  teachings is to keep it dynamic, to keep the entourage there, keep the resin resonating us
[02:22:11.620 --> 02:22:18.500]  and keep it together. So as we move forward and we make products, let's continue to stand up for
[02:22:18.500 --> 02:22:25.140]  compassionate medicine. Our products need to represent the natural state that they were grown
[02:22:26.100 --> 02:22:32.740]  in. When our products mimic the natural environment that they grow in, that's when they have the
[02:22:32.740 --> 02:22:39.620]  ultimate potential to make change. And that's what we need to continue to work towards in
[02:22:40.740 --> 02:22:47.620]  farm gate sales or keeping it medicinal and not only legal. Standing up and trying to create
[02:22:47.700 --> 02:22:56.020]  systems for free medicine for people that can't afford it, co-ops, local urban co-ops where even
[02:22:56.020 --> 02:23:00.900]  people, we have had amazing conversations with people in Compton and different areas where
[02:23:00.900 --> 02:23:06.500]  there's people that want to grow CBD in their backyards and then all make medicine together
[02:23:06.500 --> 02:23:12.980]  and create medicine for their community. Anything that's doing that is positive and it also gives us
[02:23:12.980 --> 02:23:22.020]  something to look forward to. So let's do things that we can look forward to and be excited about.
[02:23:22.020 --> 02:23:26.420]  And that's what cannabis gives us that opportunity because we can make a different environment,
[02:23:26.420 --> 02:23:33.140]  we can make a different product, we can create new community and we can continue the ever unfolding
[02:23:33.140 --> 02:23:40.790]  story of health and well-being. Thank you. I have a question.
[02:23:41.750 --> 02:23:47.190]  What seeds are you guys prepping for the springtime? What are you going to plant this season?
[02:23:48.230 --> 02:23:53.350]  Or what are you most excited about? What's like a yearly staple and what's something new and different?
[02:23:55.190 --> 02:24:01.510]  Yearly staple is everything that you can think about that you put in a food storage in the north.
[02:24:02.230 --> 02:24:08.310]  So we have all of our cabbages, we've been growing these gorgeous amazing cone-shaped
[02:24:09.110 --> 02:24:16.230]  cabbages that are purple that just make amazing fermentation. Our potatoes, all of our
[02:24:16.230 --> 02:24:22.630]  root veggies and then we have all of our greens that we put into the freezer so that we make
[02:24:22.630 --> 02:24:28.630]  sure that we have some semi-fresh greens all winter long which is like all of our chards.
[02:24:29.190 --> 02:24:33.350]  The Swiss chards do amazing up here. They get recharted. They don't need a lot.
[02:24:33.430 --> 02:24:41.830]  My garden's recharted too. It's like the plant that just keeps going and going and going.
[02:24:41.830 --> 02:24:51.190]  It's like yeah I planted like two in a corner and now it's just like and I gotta tame it.
[02:24:52.790 --> 02:24:57.990]  That's great. You have fodder for if it's too much then you can mulch it.
[02:24:57.990 --> 02:25:05.190]  Well the funny thing so I love chard. My wife doesn't. So like I grew it all excited to be like
[02:25:05.190 --> 02:25:09.670]  we're gonna eat this all the time and then she's like yeah I don't like that. I was like oh.
[02:25:12.870 --> 02:25:17.670]  Does she like the juice of it at all because sometimes juicing it you know with carrot juice?
[02:25:17.670 --> 02:25:24.870]  I don't know. I haven't done a lot. For like a year period a long time ago I was juicing all
[02:25:24.870 --> 02:25:31.110]  the time and now I just kind of just eat lots of vegetables. I remember I traumatized my mom
[02:25:31.110 --> 02:25:37.030]  because I was hanging out with my parents for a summer and like the entire kitchen had you know
[02:25:37.030 --> 02:25:43.750]  juicing vegetables everywhere and my mom was she likes to keep things very neat and
[02:25:46.470 --> 02:25:53.350]  I'm known for clutter. Well a lot of times a regenerative polyculture garden has that
[02:25:53.430 --> 02:25:58.550]  clutter appearance and stuff so you know that's part of the health too because then you get to
[02:25:58.550 --> 02:26:04.310]  put it on the garden. But yeah I would just say roots, fruits, and shoots. That's what we count
[02:26:04.310 --> 02:26:14.630]  on. So we're looking for good carrots, good garlic, good onions, good beets, burdock. These types of
[02:26:14.630 --> 02:26:22.390]  roots even dandelion roots those types of things save all winter. We look towards winter squash
[02:26:22.950 --> 02:26:28.390]  because we could show you we have boxes still of winter squash and they also feed our dogs.
[02:26:29.030 --> 02:26:35.830]  Potatoes, we use potatoes not just for food but also for poultices on skin and ailments.
[02:26:36.630 --> 02:26:40.230]  People may not know but shredding potatoes and putting it on your skin
[02:26:40.950 --> 02:26:48.550]  will suck illness out of your body. And so you know potatoes we've already talked about are like
[02:26:48.630 --> 02:26:56.790]  the sacred you know entity of DEM. But anyway so all the things but so the things that we also
[02:26:56.790 --> 02:27:04.070]  focus on are superfood bushes that we can grow in our environment. Exactly. You know we can grow a
[02:27:04.070 --> 02:27:09.830]  lot of superfoods and we're learning how to freeze dry some of those if we want to or how to preserve
[02:27:09.830 --> 02:27:17.590]  those in fermentations. More berry bushes because they feed the hens that we have. We have a couple
[02:27:17.590 --> 02:27:27.030]  of roosters too but they feed the ducks and they feed us. And also agroforestry and so what we're
[02:27:27.030 --> 02:27:34.630]  looking at is just more diverse willow species and we have we have a wet area on our land. So
[02:27:35.590 --> 02:27:41.430]  I love basket weaving and I haven't gotten good at it yet but we have close family that are really
[02:27:41.430 --> 02:27:46.310]  into basket weaving. And there's you know you can grow 30 different types of willow all different
[02:27:46.310 --> 02:27:52.310]  colors are red osier and all these different bushes. If anyone can remember this this needs
[02:27:52.310 --> 02:28:02.870]  to be a trivia question for the future. Random interests of Josh from Dragonfly. And if someone
[02:28:02.870 --> 02:28:08.470]  can guess that he's an avid basket weaver they will win something. But we can't do it for a while
[02:28:08.470 --> 02:28:14.470]  because we need to wait till everyone forgets. Yeah I got a bunch of baskets for people. Oh yeah
[02:28:16.710 --> 02:28:23.510]  um you know and one seed place that we're getting food from is Pease Seeds. So people can look up
[02:28:23.510 --> 02:28:31.670]  peace seedlings dot blog spot. And what what is best really in their local zone and environment
[02:28:31.670 --> 02:28:40.390]  is not necessarily getting online and looking for seeds but going to their local farmers market
[02:28:40.390 --> 02:28:48.070]  because that local farmers market has seeds that are intelligent already to your zone and your
[02:28:48.070 --> 02:28:55.430]  location. Ones that already do well. And if you can't then still try to find seed companies
[02:28:55.430 --> 02:29:00.790]  that are based out of your zone so that you know that those seeds are going to have
[02:29:00.790 --> 02:29:05.030]  a way better chance of future generations and every generation.
[02:29:05.990 --> 02:29:12.230]  I'm in L.A. so so most things can do okay down here. They're like what this is easy.
[02:29:13.510 --> 02:29:20.790]  I don't have to combat like negative 50 degrees in the winter. So actually one of the bummers
[02:29:20.790 --> 02:29:28.550]  the flower I smoked was from Green Source that Nick gave me up at the Emerald Cup. And it reminded
[02:29:28.550 --> 02:29:34.790]  me that he was going to give me a bunch of vegetable seeds from his farm. And then I like
[02:29:34.790 --> 02:29:39.190]  went away and I was thinking I was going to come back. And it was only when I got back to L.A. that
[02:29:39.190 --> 02:29:46.070]  I realized that I didn't take him up on that and I was bummed. I'm sure he would give you give
[02:29:46.070 --> 02:29:52.150]  him. He'd be happy to send them to you. Sure. And that's true. You get a seed from someone like
[02:29:52.150 --> 02:30:00.070]  Green Source or a person who has an intelligent intentional farm. You're getting micro
[02:30:00.950 --> 02:30:08.470]  out of their soil because they store in the seed. So when you when you germinate a seed from say
[02:30:08.470 --> 02:30:14.070]  Nick and Liz you're getting their farm in your soil. That's a beautiful thing. And then it gets
[02:30:14.070 --> 02:30:19.510]  to interact with your environment. And you know so where you get your seed from is very important.
[02:30:19.510 --> 02:30:26.070]  And it's going to be part of its vitality in life. One thing I would grow in my yard if I
[02:30:26.070 --> 02:30:32.790]  lived down there would be a Moringa tree. And they can go wild but you can cut I have Moringa seeds.
[02:30:33.430 --> 02:30:41.510]  So this is one of the reasons why I want to I called Phil yesterday and left a message. But
[02:30:41.510 --> 02:30:47.910]  I want to start growing Moringa like I have weeping willow outside. Moringa would be cool to grow.
[02:30:49.750 --> 02:30:58.630]  Moringa would have an incredibly high growth hormone rate in it. So I don't know if there's
[02:30:58.630 --> 02:31:03.830]  you know how much they're generally like acids in there whatever it is. But you know when you put
[02:31:03.830 --> 02:31:11.350]  a Moringa tree in the branch in the ground it grows a tree you know like a willow. But but wow
[02:31:11.350 --> 02:31:19.670]  it can grow even better. And and the leaves from a Moringa tree it's like the miracle tree. It has
[02:31:19.670 --> 02:31:26.630]  more nutrients and protein out of any plant or tree. I you know maybe besides algae on earth.
[02:31:27.350 --> 02:31:32.230]  So everyone grow Moringa. If you live in Florida you probably have too much Moringa around you.
[02:31:33.030 --> 02:31:40.550]  There's no such thing. Oh that's so rad. Are those big or are those packages of small. Yeah nice.
[02:31:42.310 --> 02:31:49.190]  They're from Tyler from Family Tree Seeds who's down here in SoCal and he's also like a citrus
[02:31:49.190 --> 02:31:57.430]  consultant. He consults for he's a cannabis breeder slash avocado orchard orange orchard
[02:31:57.990 --> 02:32:04.710]  lemon orchard consultant. So I'm like whatever he's growing in his yard is probably pretty good.
[02:32:05.190 --> 02:32:07.990]  Yeah I always call those people pro-sultans.
[02:32:09.990 --> 02:32:16.950]  Instead of consultants. Yeah you know they're just the good. I always love your guys plays on words.
[02:32:18.310 --> 02:32:27.110]  Such a pleasure. And one other piece about trading seeds is that you're absolutely correct. The
[02:32:27.110 --> 02:32:34.230]  endophytic biology that are stored in those seeds and seed coatings are incredibly important.
[02:32:35.190 --> 02:32:43.750]  And diverse. So yeah trade seeds with everybody for sure. The community wanted to ask you Josh
[02:32:43.750 --> 02:32:49.350]  and Kelly as well. More and more people are getting in obviously into natural farming and
[02:32:49.350 --> 02:32:53.270]  realizing I think some of them even finding out the hidden bullshit of.
[02:32:55.670 --> 02:33:02.630]  I can't think of the there's a system it's not the USDA but it or organic or anything but it's
[02:33:02.630 --> 02:33:08.790]  OMRI sorry. So the OMRI certification is kind of bullshit. And so there's a lot of people that
[02:33:08.790 --> 02:33:12.790]  even there's three people that reached out this morning to me that wanted to know what is the
[02:33:12.790 --> 02:33:19.030]  process to get your DemPure certification. I guess there's been some confusion on that.
[02:33:22.750 --> 02:33:29.630]  Well our DemPure certification first of all is community monitored community run
[02:33:30.590 --> 02:33:38.030]  community generated regenerated. Josh and I started it at the very beginning and not going
[02:33:38.030 --> 02:33:42.910]  to go in deep to this at all. We just started it because we were upset with the loopholes that were
[02:33:42.910 --> 02:33:54.110]  happening in now the sort of hijacking or the low jacking of the word organic. So we came up with
[02:33:54.110 --> 02:34:01.070]  medicine going onto the market being tainted with toxins. And also this idea of that certifications
[02:34:01.070 --> 02:34:07.550]  were just focused on what your products and what you were bringing into your gardens. And
[02:34:07.550 --> 02:34:15.070]  we just didn't represent that as farmers of 25 years or whatever of cannabis farmers of food
[02:34:15.070 --> 02:34:21.710]  farmers of tons of people that we had worked with in the past. So we created DemPure off of
[02:34:22.670 --> 02:34:30.430]  you know systems that are part of your land and systems that are part of your gardens
[02:34:30.430 --> 02:34:37.470]  are more of the focus and what creates the products not the focus on the products and
[02:34:37.470 --> 02:34:43.950]  let's just checklist this off. So instead of a pay to play type certification meaning
[02:34:44.750 --> 02:34:51.470]  A I just bought a farm these are my lists of products certify me. I'm not saying there's
[02:34:51.470 --> 02:34:56.590]  anything wrong with that but we wanted to go beyond that and we wanted to say instead of
[02:34:57.630 --> 02:35:03.630]  just showing me your products what we want to see is actually a very small product list
[02:35:04.190 --> 02:35:13.230]  and we want any single product to be into toxicity tested rather than just an OMRI
[02:35:13.230 --> 02:35:17.710]  certification. You would have to get that toxicity tested individually batch tested
[02:35:18.270 --> 02:35:22.590]  same as we have to do for our products that we bring to the market. You know our garden we have
[02:35:22.590 --> 02:35:31.630]  garden products since 2007 and we've been working with labs and toxicities and state OMRI and USDA
[02:35:31.710 --> 02:35:37.150]  USDA every state having a different you know jurisdiction on what they can allow on the
[02:35:37.150 --> 02:35:42.350]  market. So we've had a lot of practice you know and working with laboratories and also
[02:35:43.150 --> 02:35:47.390]  being herbalist you know seeing how the medicine represents. So what we did is we said
[02:35:48.350 --> 02:35:53.950]  you have to have six closed loop systems to be DemPure certified. That's one of the things that
[02:35:53.950 --> 02:35:57.470]  makes it to where you can't just move on a farm and two weeks later have a DemPure certification.
[02:35:57.470 --> 02:36:02.750]  And you have to have six closed loops that have been running within a year and you have to have
[02:36:02.750 --> 02:36:12.110]  a myriad of other closed loops that are also being planned on your property. Whether we only have
[02:36:12.110 --> 02:36:20.430]  really one indoor certified as DemPure. There's more there's probably five in total one really
[02:36:20.430 --> 02:36:26.030]  highlighted you know Green Life Productions. Other ones may have more greenhouses or they
[02:36:26.030 --> 02:36:33.630]  definitely have alternative sunlight as well. But for it's to have a full complete closed loop
[02:36:33.630 --> 02:36:39.950]  which means that you create it and you end it on your property. It doesn't mean that all of these
[02:36:39.950 --> 02:36:46.270]  different things go into one closed loop and those are all considered a closed loop. A closed loop
[02:36:46.270 --> 02:36:54.270]  for instance if you were making a cover crop if you want to count a cover crop as a closed loop
[02:36:54.270 --> 02:37:01.230]  in order for that cover crop to be a closed loop you have to be producing the seeds that make that
[02:37:01.230 --> 02:37:10.270]  cover crop on the gardens that they're going to grow on. Then you have one closed loop. It isn't
[02:37:10.270 --> 02:37:18.110]  bringing in other seeds and saying I now have a closed loop and being able to have that seed going
[02:37:18.830 --> 02:37:28.190]  for an entire year as a cover crop that means that now you have a closed loop that DemPure sees
[02:37:28.190 --> 02:37:34.590]  as a closed loop. And it's the upper it's a little bit more difficult for indoor farmers.
[02:37:34.590 --> 02:37:39.230]  I think that's what you were going to say. No I'm just going to say this quickly on that seed front but you can
[02:37:39.230 --> 02:37:45.390]  once you have like a blend of cover crops and you've now seeded it out on your own property
[02:37:45.390 --> 02:37:51.470]  have tons of seeds to keep going the introduction of new like swapping in new cover crops you got to
[02:37:51.470 --> 02:37:56.270]  start with like the immaculate conception like the seeds have to come from outside if you don't
[02:37:56.270 --> 02:38:04.830]  currently have them. So how do you onboard or add new cover crops that haven't themselves of the mix
[02:38:04.830 --> 02:38:12.350]  gone through the whole closed loop cycle. Yeah so yeah you have that question make any sense.
[02:38:12.750 --> 02:38:19.150]  Yeah you're so right on. Go ahead Josh. I was just trying to say it was like it's not that you never
[02:38:19.150 --> 02:38:28.430]  buy another seed again. It's just it's really easy to save seeds and even for us we have jars and jars
[02:38:28.430 --> 02:38:33.790]  of seeds. We're going to plant our seeds first. You know we're going to try that first and that's
[02:38:34.590 --> 02:38:42.510]  this is when we were joking about shard. This is me from I guess last summer where it's just like
[02:38:42.510 --> 02:38:48.830]  and just every like couple of months they're just like throwing off seeds and I sit in a beach chair
[02:38:48.830 --> 02:38:57.230]  in my yard just like doing this and you realize the abundance that you that can be had if there's
[02:38:57.230 --> 02:39:05.550]  just a simple mentality switch. Most a lot of the foods that we eat have seeds in them. I mean if
[02:39:05.550 --> 02:39:12.670]  you want to grow winter squash go to the store buy winter squash and instead of throwing the seeds
[02:39:12.670 --> 02:39:18.990]  away in your compost dry them out on a plate and plant them. Well you could get any squash. Well
[02:39:20.350 --> 02:39:26.030]  a mix of winter squash but primarily they're grown in fields where they're not going to be
[02:39:26.030 --> 02:39:32.190]  interbred with a whole bunch of other different squash. And the point is wow there's a seed around
[02:39:32.190 --> 02:39:38.430]  and if you're not buying it and all you're doing is planting it you know it's it all becomes food.
[02:39:38.430 --> 02:39:44.910]  You know so we often throw away let's put it this way how many seeds do you throw away in the
[02:39:44.910 --> 02:39:51.550]  compost or the garbage every year? Every single apple you eat, every single tomato that you eat,
[02:39:51.550 --> 02:39:57.950]  you probably eat the seeds of course on tomatoes. But wow there's a lot of seeds in our food.
[02:39:58.750 --> 02:40:03.950]  So you know also getting beyond the seeds in our food because often the seeds the food that we're
[02:40:03.950 --> 02:40:11.150]  eating at the stores is very very limited genetically. So really what you're going for
[02:40:11.150 --> 02:40:20.270]  is heritage farms and heritage market farms and saving those seeds. So definitely going for
[02:40:20.270 --> 02:40:26.270]  diversity and color in food. People should study what amino acids are in foods. They should study
[02:40:27.070 --> 02:40:36.910]  how acids turn to proteins and how color in food affects antioxidant levels in your body.
[02:40:36.910 --> 02:40:42.430]  Because it's all it's all there for you and and a lot of companies don't you know test that. But
[02:40:42.990 --> 02:40:49.390]  you know amino acids are are the key building block to the proteins in our life and they can be
[02:40:49.390 --> 02:40:54.670]  found in abundance in certain foods and often the foods we get from the store are not the foods that
[02:40:54.670 --> 02:41:00.670]  that are high in in those kind of compounds. So very important the seed source.
[02:41:02.510 --> 02:41:09.230]  And now Peter you have like an abundance of chard seeds that you could be trading because there's
[02:41:09.230 --> 02:41:15.870]  tons of people. I do I give it away I send it out to people. That is so awesome.
[02:41:16.190 --> 02:41:21.630]  But that's why I'm also like really dead set on exactly what you guys are talking about like
[02:41:21.630 --> 02:41:28.750]  because sometimes I'll get like like you know we get a cucumber from Whole Foods which is a good
[02:41:28.750 --> 02:41:34.750]  cucumber but I don't want to start with those seeds. You know it's like that's why finding
[02:41:34.750 --> 02:41:39.870]  someone like a Nick or other people like Tyler who I just mentioned and just other people like Alex
[02:41:39.870 --> 02:41:48.590]  Hardy you guys all these people who have been breeding kind of heirloom corn tobacco different.
[02:41:48.590 --> 02:41:57.790]  I mean all the vegetables like that's what I would want to get out there. And so the whole yeah I
[02:41:57.790 --> 02:42:04.270]  love I love the seed side of the vegetables and but can you give a because I love this. It's like
[02:42:04.270 --> 02:42:09.150]  you're a white. I don't know the like belt levels of karate but it's like you're the lowest belt
[02:42:09.150 --> 02:42:14.910]  which is like I have one closed loop system on my property like you can sort of flex. But then it's
[02:42:14.910 --> 02:42:21.870]  like some other dudes like I got nine and he's just like fucking mic drop moment. So can you give
[02:42:21.870 --> 02:42:27.230]  it. Can you give examples of some of the other. I mean that's I love that closed loop system. Can
[02:42:27.230 --> 02:42:32.990]  you give some other closed loop system examples that people have on their properties. Yeah well
[02:42:32.990 --> 02:42:38.990]  definitely alternative energy. So people that are having solar systems of course we know that the
[02:42:38.990 --> 02:42:46.430]  solar system is bought but it's so much better than getting electricity you know from whatever.
[02:42:46.430 --> 02:42:54.270]  So a really conscious awesome alternative energy system saving water and biodiesel or something.
[02:42:55.390 --> 02:43:01.230]  Yeah. Something like that is really amazing. People that are running a generator if they're
[02:43:01.230 --> 02:43:08.750]  running it off of their handmade biodiesel from their property then that's really a beautiful
[02:43:08.750 --> 02:43:16.030]  closed loop that we have to look at that took intention time energy and and continuous upkeep.
[02:43:16.030 --> 02:43:21.790]  But we also want to see that they had that system running for a whole year that that was running. It
[02:43:21.790 --> 02:43:27.870]  was working for a whole year because then we know that they were integrating it into that. So that
[02:43:27.870 --> 02:43:33.150]  would be like a whole closed loop system that we have a lot of things that are on our Web site
[02:43:33.150 --> 02:43:42.430]  that Josh that we've listed. I mean using gray water you know in your in your gardens can be
[02:43:42.430 --> 02:43:48.910]  another one rainwater to gray water is a whole closed loop managing the. So I guess I've said
[02:43:48.910 --> 02:43:55.310]  this before but the polyculture garden is rich in material. Right. So now all of a sudden there
[02:43:55.310 --> 02:44:01.950]  is extra branches so you can chip or layer the branches on. That would be a closed loop. You
[02:44:01.950 --> 02:44:08.270]  don't have to go buy wood chips or you can grow a certain area in cover crops. And then if you
[02:44:08.270 --> 02:44:15.550]  use that grass you know there's there's a closed loop system. But the closed loop in that no matter
[02:44:15.550 --> 02:44:21.630]  how many just to make it clear for people if you're laying many different types of mulch the
[02:44:21.630 --> 02:44:27.470]  closed loop here is that you're building your soil from your own materials. That's one close
[02:44:27.470 --> 02:44:33.790]  loop. That's why you can't say oh well I have straw. That's one closed loop. I have wood chips.
[02:44:33.790 --> 02:44:39.870]  That's one closed loop. What the closed loop is is that you're growing materials on your land which
[02:44:39.870 --> 02:44:48.110]  makes soil. That's one closed loop. That's why it's challenging to look at something from a whole
[02:44:48.190 --> 02:44:54.750]  holistic. That's why eight six closed loops for a farm is a big deal. But just like you were saying
[02:44:54.750 --> 02:45:01.630]  Peter you know the black belt who has the mic drop who has all the closed loops is just the dude that
[02:45:01.630 --> 02:45:07.310]  started running six closed loops for a couple of years. Because once you have a few closed loops
[02:45:07.310 --> 02:45:13.790]  on your farm you start realizing oh my God there's all these closed loops there's closed loops
[02:45:13.790 --> 02:45:19.950]  everywhere which just start fitting small closed loops into larger closed loops. Then you sort of
[02:45:19.950 --> 02:45:26.030]  get addicted to closed loops. What's one of the most interesting closed loops someone's thrown at
[02:45:26.750 --> 02:45:32.430]  the group that nobody had ever done before that everyone was like that's actually pretty awesome.
[02:45:35.930 --> 02:45:42.250]  Yeah. So that's like you were just also Josh is just saying they wish to just give examples too
[02:45:42.890 --> 02:45:48.730]  is that the one would be like of the soil and if you're going to have like gray water as a closed
[02:45:48.730 --> 02:45:54.570]  loop then the complete closed loop would be that you're catching rain water and then you're turning
[02:45:54.570 --> 02:46:01.450]  it into gray water or you're turning that you're using on your crops. That's a complete rain
[02:46:01.450 --> 02:46:06.970]  rain water and gray water we know are different. So you'd have rain water going into a garden and
[02:46:06.970 --> 02:46:11.130]  that would be groundwater swale humeral culture.
[02:46:13.370 --> 02:46:20.490]  I think water would come from what you're drinking or coming out of your house and that would go into
[02:46:20.490 --> 02:46:25.210]  your system. That's if that's another close. Another another closed loop system would be that
[02:46:25.210 --> 02:46:31.770]  you're growing all of the biomass that's going into the nutrients that you're feeding your plants.
[02:46:32.490 --> 02:46:39.130]  So the soil making is one can be one closed loop. We consider that one closed loop and your
[02:46:39.130 --> 02:46:46.650]  continued nutrient feeding if it's all coming from your land and if you're going to be in the
[02:46:46.650 --> 02:46:55.210]  form of teas in the form of maybe compost you may be adding it as like a compost tea that you're
[02:46:55.210 --> 02:47:01.290]  utilizing something more of a tea and a continuous nutrient. That's another closed loop that you're
[02:47:01.290 --> 02:47:07.690]  growing all of the food and stuff from there. Another closed loop would be that you're growing
[02:47:07.690 --> 02:47:15.610]  all of the nutrients that your cows are eating that you're then turning into soil
[02:47:16.810 --> 02:47:23.770]  and then utilizing also your chickens. Yeah an animal or you're turning it into
[02:47:24.650 --> 02:47:30.730]  sweaters that you're making for community. Some people have an overabundance of sheep wool and
[02:47:30.730 --> 02:47:36.010]  they use sheep wool as a mulch on their garden. That's just one example.
[02:47:36.650 --> 02:47:44.250]  Lots of different things. You might be growing the products for your
[02:47:44.250 --> 02:47:48.170]  for your products. You might be growing the materials for your products so that's a close.
[02:47:49.370 --> 02:47:54.570]  What's going on with the sheep wool like six months later because I know when I cut my hair
[02:47:54.570 --> 02:48:00.410]  I throw it into the composter but then like a year later that hair is still in a big it basically
[02:48:00.410 --> 02:48:10.970]  makes like a clumpy mud ball and the hair takes forever to decompose. Yeah the wool gets eaten.
[02:48:10.970 --> 02:48:16.650]  It just gets you know you'd have a weird wool like layer but you'd have to like maybe
[02:48:17.370 --> 02:48:23.290]  dig your aisle out and cover the wool a little bit and stuff but it wool animal hair is used
[02:48:23.290 --> 02:48:30.170]  for mulch all all over the place and in you know different settings. And then you realize that you
[02:48:30.170 --> 02:48:36.570]  have much higher silica because the microorganisms that are drawn to break down the animal hair are
[02:48:36.570 --> 02:48:42.570]  ones that like to break down silica and then you're now you're just become more. That's pretty cool.
[02:48:44.090 --> 02:48:53.130]  Yeah yeah I mean that that blows my mind like so specifically hair is known to like first like
[02:48:53.130 --> 02:48:57.610]  you're like I need to dial up the silica it's like oh go shave some animals and throw there
[02:48:57.610 --> 02:49:03.370]  and you're like thanks for the pro tip. That's exactly that's exactly it and you would you would
[02:49:03.370 --> 02:49:12.410]  totally do that and you would be drawing more silica eating microbiology to your soil which
[02:49:12.410 --> 02:49:18.730]  then you realize well we actually maybe had lots of silica but it wasn't enough of a draw to draw
[02:49:18.730 --> 02:49:26.410]  that microbiology that's inside of the lanolin on the sheep wool already that's already part of the
[02:49:26.410 --> 02:49:35.210]  wool that you're also inoculating into so not only does the sheep wool have good wool but it also has
[02:49:35.930 --> 02:49:41.770]  microbiology to break down the wool so that's just being inoculated into your gardens.
[02:49:41.770 --> 02:49:47.530]  And what's interesting there is that the sheep is eventually going to eat the plants that were
[02:49:47.530 --> 02:49:55.050]  grown in the soil that had the microbes that broke down the sheep's own wool right and like a big
[02:49:55.050 --> 02:50:08.330]  circle there. You get it that's it that's dynamic and that's a closed loop. Yeah
[02:50:10.970 --> 02:50:16.890]  so there's still the question I had what is the what is the most creative closed loop you've got seen?
[02:50:17.690 --> 02:50:27.770]  Well you know I can say that as far as like the industry is concerned and as far as like an impact
[02:50:27.770 --> 02:50:36.170]  on the industry green life productions because they are one of our indoor facilities.
[02:50:36.170 --> 02:50:42.330]  Let's say put this put it out there that they're making an amazing food and produce whole farm
[02:50:42.410 --> 02:50:49.370]  food and produce whole farm right now with greenhouses. I saw that I was like yeah fucking
[02:50:49.370 --> 02:50:56.330]  awesome. They do everything yeah but they're guys the goat I feel like for a lot of us
[02:50:56.970 --> 02:51:02.890]  fairly at least the indoor side of things yeah yeah and his partner Quanine yeah thanks yeah
[02:51:02.890 --> 02:51:08.410]  absolutely I got I was lucky enough to meet uh both of the uh personally when I was in Las Vegas
[02:51:08.410 --> 02:51:13.450]  and got to see the setup before they kind of I guess launched everything but beautiful home
[02:51:14.330 --> 02:51:21.450]  beautiful family they started big up so this is specifically what we're talking about so this I
[02:51:21.450 --> 02:51:27.050]  only noticed recently right so you're saying that they only just started this up but like when I saw
[02:51:27.050 --> 02:51:34.330]  this I was like that's awesome I mean this is in Nevada yeah exactly yeah they have a good community
[02:51:34.570 --> 02:51:42.970]  Brad yeah Thurmanator and Brad Thurmanator on Instagram has been growing the most beautiful
[02:51:42.970 --> 02:51:51.530]  soil transforming the transform are there is that for animals that looks like no this area
[02:51:52.330 --> 02:51:59.210]  I know facility you know soil transfer are they gonna have animals though because they have the
[02:51:59.930 --> 02:52:06.250]  animals dogs well they they have right next to them he's an animal they have
[02:52:08.890 --> 02:52:17.130]  already a big uh compost capabilities and they've had for a long time of a big cow lot
[02:52:17.130 --> 02:52:23.130]  so they were able to talk their neighbors and also family members of Green Life Productions
[02:52:23.770 --> 02:52:29.530]  into turning it into a totally regenerative cow lot so now they're going to be using I'm sure
[02:52:30.170 --> 02:52:33.770]  and I don't want to speak for them you guys should get them on they're totally amazing but
[02:52:33.770 --> 02:52:40.010]  I wanted to also get back to their creative clothes loop that they had which was their six
[02:52:40.010 --> 02:52:46.650]  clothes loop which now they have many more which got them the Dempere certification was that they
[02:52:46.650 --> 02:52:53.690]  had a bottle collection and they were getting back all of their jars jars that they sold all
[02:52:53.690 --> 02:53:00.250]  of the weed jars that they were selling and they were giving out products for trade and they were
[02:53:00.250 --> 02:53:06.890]  sterilizing them in-house and then relabeling them and putting them back out by all of their
[02:53:06.890 --> 02:53:11.290]  employees that were already in-house growers and their trimmers and everything and a lot of
[02:53:11.290 --> 02:53:16.410]  dehumidifier reusing of water and air conditioning yeah and that was all done by the dehus
[02:53:17.050 --> 02:53:23.850]  yeah that's awesome and and if you make hash you know you can use a lot of that leaf back in your
[02:53:23.850 --> 02:53:30.490]  soil on the top and stuff I love that their jar like retake program gives people a lot more
[02:53:30.490 --> 02:53:34.810]  incentive than your average one because they're like no we'll give you weed if you bring your
[02:53:34.810 --> 02:53:41.930]  jar back and everyone's like oh fuck yeah people religiously save them and count them and and
[02:53:41.930 --> 02:53:48.970]  they're really on top of it so that was a super creative one and you know people are so creative
[02:53:48.970 --> 02:53:55.050]  you can their clothes loops and you can like and not like human humanure but you know humanure if
[02:53:55.050 --> 02:54:04.490]  you do study korean natural farming or if you study ancient asian farming you know you'll see
[02:54:04.490 --> 02:54:11.450]  that the grandmothers and grandfathers believe if you're not using your own you know waste broken
[02:54:11.450 --> 02:54:18.810]  down properly of course then you're not interacting your genetic material with the plants that you're
[02:54:18.810 --> 02:54:28.330]  growing so you know there's ways of using your urine and water or using humanure or composting
[02:54:28.330 --> 02:54:33.530]  toilets in a way that can be really effective if you have fruit trees just having fruit trees
[02:54:34.090 --> 02:54:39.130]  and if you have a piece of property saving your urine and just putting it around the drip line
[02:54:39.770 --> 02:54:46.330]  at like even like a half and half around the drip line of your fruit trees if you have a big piece
[02:54:46.330 --> 02:54:54.410]  of property you will watch ailments maladies melt away from those fruit trees and you will watch
[02:54:54.410 --> 02:55:00.250]  higher yielding fruit it's amazing and this is just this is not a big deal this is just
[02:55:00.330 --> 02:55:06.330]  peeing in a bucket and putting the pee around the fruit line you know and a lot of people
[02:55:06.330 --> 02:55:13.450]  are freaked out by that but the reason why people are freaked out by that is because our education
[02:55:13.450 --> 02:55:19.850]  which is what we've been talking about the whole day has taken us away from nature and has it even
[02:55:19.850 --> 02:55:26.810]  taken us as components and of nature away from nature well and also you wouldn't want to use
[02:55:26.810 --> 02:55:32.170]  anyone's pee necessarily either because pharmaceuticals go yeah go through the pee
[02:55:33.050 --> 02:55:43.210]  and a lot of urban water a lot of water in urban in cities are is recycled gray water and when
[02:55:43.210 --> 02:55:49.210]  tested a lot of that water has pharmaceuticals in it heavy amounts of it and it's going into
[02:55:49.210 --> 02:55:55.770]  your drinking water recycled human weight well i'm laughing because i've basically marked my
[02:55:55.770 --> 02:56:02.650]  entire yard with my pee and uh but i'm on a quarter acre so like every plant in my yard has
[02:56:02.650 --> 02:56:07.850]  gotten plenty of my pee and to the point where they're all like oh dude like enough i have enough
[02:56:07.850 --> 02:56:16.810]  of your pee on me but uh yeah no i i you know that it's did you know that if that's the the thing is
[02:56:16.810 --> 02:56:23.770]  one person can fertilize a quarter acre with just their oh yeah no i i i i know i'm putting too much
[02:56:23.770 --> 02:56:27.450]  my own pee all over my yard but uh i'm just like sorry everyone
[02:56:30.570 --> 02:56:32.970]  it could go in the toilet or it could go all over you
[02:56:34.490 --> 02:56:41.050]  and maybe you're taking your your your apples and you're making alcohol from your apples and then
[02:56:41.850 --> 02:56:42.250]  making
[02:56:46.250 --> 02:56:50.090]  alcohol you made from your apples and
[02:56:53.210 --> 02:56:59.610]  kick kill your uh kill your camera for a second yes just take it back up to apples and alcohol
[02:57:01.850 --> 02:57:08.250]  you could be uh growing your own apples and creating alcohol out of the apples and then
[02:57:08.250 --> 02:57:15.770]  making tincture from that alcohol and then you could use the tincture or boil the the tincture
[02:57:15.770 --> 02:57:21.930]  down and create cannabis oil and that would be you know a closed loop and or also you could maybe
[02:57:21.930 --> 02:57:29.210]  you can grow castor beans you know and you press the beans and get the oil and now you're using
[02:57:29.210 --> 02:57:34.730]  castor oil packs i mean there really are i mean it's and sunflowers next thing you know you're
[02:57:35.530 --> 02:57:41.050]  you you can get the the norwalk press the home presses and you can it's amazing how much oil
[02:57:41.050 --> 02:57:45.690]  you can get out of some of these seeds right that's the whole beautiful purpose and now you
[02:57:45.690 --> 02:57:52.330]  can create oil um these are the types of closed loops that were biodynamics and rudolf steiner
[02:57:52.330 --> 02:57:58.090]  you know their whole entire biodynamic you know certification and demeanor certification is also
[02:57:58.650 --> 02:58:06.410]  built on closed loops so closed loop is an old world term it's not a term we we created it's it's
[02:58:06.410 --> 02:58:13.690]  a term that there's lots of examples online of closed loops methane gas is a really creative
[02:58:13.690 --> 02:58:22.730]  closed loop if people don't know let's say john john pain j-e-a-n-p-a-i-n is uh john pain not
[02:58:22.730 --> 02:58:29.690]  obvious i'm saying that wrong but amazing amazing person and and an incredible books on
[02:58:30.330 --> 02:58:37.050]  composting wood chips and creating hot water you could create hot water from your compost pile to
[02:58:37.050 --> 02:58:42.010]  heat your greenhouse and then the compost pile in the end after heating your greenhouse would
[02:58:42.010 --> 02:58:49.210]  turn into soil or it could be a hot water heater you know for a shower or and you can collect the
[02:58:49.210 --> 02:58:56.570]  methane from the compost pile and you can run tractors on methane you can run cars on there's
[02:58:56.570 --> 02:59:02.730]  you can cook all your food all your food from methane gas i really suggest people
[02:59:02.730 --> 02:59:08.890]  john pain even created his own wood chipper so now we're talking these wood chip piles we're
[02:59:08.890 --> 02:59:15.850]  talking they last they last 18 months some of these compost piles yeah and then they created
[02:59:15.850 --> 02:59:22.730]  his own wood chipper that chips the wood in a certain way and teaches you about the different
[02:59:22.730 --> 02:59:27.930]  kinds of wood chips that you'll get you know wood chips from hemp stock would be different than a
[02:59:27.930 --> 02:59:34.010]  wood chip from the end of a willow tree or the stock of a pine tree and it's cool it's like you
[02:59:34.010 --> 02:59:40.090]  can learn about all the headiness and go in deep and and get all of the information or you can just
[02:59:40.090 --> 02:59:49.050]  know like wood chips you know like it can be as simple or as deep as you want it and closed loops
[02:59:49.050 --> 02:59:57.530]  are created off of simplicity or you know incredible depths but definitely there's farms that come on
[02:59:57.530 --> 03:00:03.610]  board that have 12 closed loops just right off of the get-go and they've been doing it for 20 years
[03:00:04.490 --> 03:00:12.570]  and it's so wonderful for them to be a part of a group of all other closed loop freaks
[03:00:13.370 --> 03:00:20.090]  and that they can have you know continuation with what it is that they're doing in actuality to what
[03:00:20.090 --> 03:00:26.410]  they're doing to be able to be with a group of people to maybe hold a certification on their
[03:00:26.410 --> 03:00:33.770]  product that represents like their lifestyle their hard work not just a checklist on what
[03:00:33.770 --> 03:00:40.570]  an investor says hey let's go ahead and do this and also the beautiful thing about Dempere is that
[03:00:40.570 --> 03:00:48.330]  it's the people that are Dempere certified that go onto the land or go into the facilities
[03:00:48.970 --> 03:00:54.890]  to certify it's not Josh and I so it's it's regional you know and that's why it's growing
[03:00:56.650 --> 03:01:03.050]  yeah so there's just so many things to it that just keeps bringing it back to community
[03:01:03.610 --> 03:01:09.930]  and we believe that if we just keep the integrity of it like that which of course it will be it will
[03:01:09.930 --> 03:01:16.090]  die before you know integrity is lost in that because people work so hard for it it is so
[03:01:16.090 --> 03:01:23.370]  meaningful so in order to be Dempere certified you have to have six closed loop systems
[03:01:23.450 --> 03:01:31.610]  it started as a cannabis certification and a cannabis farmer part of requirements is you have
[03:01:31.610 --> 03:01:37.370]  to grow food that was almost a revelation you're like what do you mean you know I'm trying to just
[03:01:37.370 --> 03:01:44.170]  get certified well food is an essential part of life and the purpose of the certification is
[03:01:45.130 --> 03:01:55.290]  and awareness so every DEM pure ganja farmer grows food they also every can't DEM pure food
[03:01:55.290 --> 03:02:00.730]  farmer has to grow cannabis has to grow some kind of medicine or some type of medicine they have to
[03:02:00.730 --> 03:02:07.050]  maybe some kind of medicine that's put into medicinal compounds it can't just be the focus
[03:02:07.050 --> 03:02:13.370]  on food because the idea is the holistic regeneration of the regeneration of the of
[03:02:13.370 --> 03:02:18.410]  the biome right is the whole entire purpose of it so and food for the medicine and medicine for the
[03:02:18.410 --> 03:02:28.890]  food you grow so that is bringing in your bio and it can be an isolate and it cannot be extracted
[03:02:28.970 --> 03:02:40.890]  from a toxic compound so you can't use BHO you can't use isopropyl we consider a toxic compound
[03:02:42.490 --> 03:02:49.850]  and you can ask us about that we also consider propane a toxic compound
[03:02:51.210 --> 03:02:56.250]  not in its natural form of course and if people and if somebody wants to why wouldn't stand over
[03:02:56.570 --> 03:03:03.530]  vent of you know methane coming out of the earth and expect to be healthy like it requires
[03:03:04.330 --> 03:03:10.410]  some intuition but the purpose of not having toxic toxicity in your ending product is that
[03:03:10.410 --> 03:03:17.610]  you don't want to have to take your sacred sentient being cannabis herb plant and then
[03:03:18.490 --> 03:03:25.290]  put a toxic compound on it to extract it and then have to purge that toxic chemical out to then make
[03:03:25.290 --> 03:03:31.930]  it pure enough to that just defeats the whole entire purpose of the practice so what what is
[03:03:31.930 --> 03:03:40.570]  you have to use beneficial you know oils and and and different products in order to extract the
[03:03:40.570 --> 03:03:46.090]  cannabis for the market and we also have dem pure and recyclable certifications for educators
[03:03:46.730 --> 03:03:52.090]  dem pure who don't have farms who are doing amazing things in the community and the way
[03:03:52.090 --> 03:03:58.490]  that that happens is that somebody in the group nominates that person and then it just sort of
[03:03:58.490 --> 03:04:03.850]  goes through a proceeds of like that person's life work and what they've been doing so that's been
[03:04:03.850 --> 03:04:10.650]  really an incredible joy to just basically honor people for the work that they've already been
[03:04:10.650 --> 03:04:19.050]  doing in the industry as well as in their lifetime we also have product certifications now and ryan
[03:04:19.130 --> 03:04:26.730]  and charlotte from aura chocolate have been super helpful in um getting that off the ground as well
[03:04:26.730 --> 03:04:34.170]  as other dem pure people so we're expanding our certifications so that you don't just have to be
[03:04:34.170 --> 03:04:42.410]  a farmer on a piece of land you just have to be a positive impact part of the closed loop regenerative
[03:04:43.050 --> 03:04:48.250]  industry that we have going and if you're an educator if you're an educator you still have
[03:04:48.250 --> 03:04:53.290]  to have a food garden yeah you still have to be doing something in the earth and things like that
[03:04:53.290 --> 03:05:01.130]  because yeah i think we pretty much covered that that was a lot i'm a positive person
[03:05:04.490 --> 03:05:09.530]  i think a lot of people were confused so thank you for clearing that up and kind of defining uh
[03:05:11.050 --> 03:05:16.170]  the main uh bullet points now that i and i love i don't know if i was the only one who is loving
[03:05:16.170 --> 03:05:22.330]  the exam i'm an examples guy so like when people give concrete exam like fuck yeah like i i actually
[03:05:22.330 --> 03:05:28.730]  i was thinking it'd be cool if we could get one by one people on who have done the closed loop
[03:05:28.730 --> 03:05:36.250]  in anything and just be like walk us through i mean if you have 18 like pick three because we'll
[03:05:36.250 --> 03:05:40.970]  let other people do some other ones but like to walk everyone through one of their closed loop
[03:05:40.970 --> 03:05:46.010]  systems like their journey to get there where they still like how they see other people doing it i
[03:05:46.010 --> 03:05:51.370]  mean it'd be cool to just have like real world example of a person after real world example of a
[03:05:51.370 --> 03:06:02.960]  person yeah i agree with that that would be super good we do have a closed loop page on dem pure
[03:06:02.960 --> 03:06:12.640]  farms.com so dem pure farms.com is where the certification is it tells you where the farms are
[03:06:13.360 --> 03:06:19.360]  it tells you about closed loop systems it shows you some of the resources of the companies that
[03:06:19.360 --> 03:06:28.160]  are like-minded and um another thing is we don't go out looking for people or farms to become part
[03:06:28.160 --> 03:06:34.880]  of the certification like what kelly said is people come to us and it is a family-run you
[03:06:34.880 --> 03:06:40.720]  know grassroots organization no one is paid so if you feel like you've reached out to us and we
[03:06:40.720 --> 03:06:46.240]  haven't gotten back to you in time or properly please write back to us we you know i had a
[03:06:46.240 --> 03:06:53.120]  computer crash we'll say we're sorry i had a computer crash for real and i was talking to
[03:06:53.120 --> 03:06:59.200]  two farms and i had no way to contact them again so so please have patience with us we're working
[03:06:59.200 --> 03:07:03.840]  on it and and you know sometimes we have made the connection with people and then we're looking for
[03:07:04.640 --> 03:07:11.520]  local support to to make the certification final um so anyway it's a grassroots organization and
[03:07:11.520 --> 03:07:17.360]  everyone we want for everyone to know each other and and work together and share ideas so that we
[03:07:17.360 --> 03:07:23.200]  can you know give each other the inspiration to make our world a better place and a lot of people
[03:07:23.200 --> 03:07:31.360]  say oh you know they're just trying to do whatever but anyone can be part of dem pure it's just about
[03:07:31.440 --> 03:07:40.560]  the practices and we welcome people and energy to be a part of this greater movement which
[03:07:41.200 --> 03:07:47.200]  doesn't know boundaries of a country we can be international we have groups all over the place
[03:07:47.200 --> 03:07:52.960]  that are really doing beautiful work and more and more coming on so that we can all support each
[03:07:52.960 --> 03:07:59.200]  other and sustainable had a question about enforceability and that's what i've always loved
[03:07:59.200 --> 03:08:06.240]  about the stem servant stem certification processes it's the community the community
[03:08:06.240 --> 03:08:14.720]  enforces it so you're not subject to a almighty leader you're you're as a whole a group that's
[03:08:14.720 --> 03:08:20.240]  raising the vibration of all of yourselves and each other so there it is is this the comment
[03:08:20.960 --> 03:08:28.960]  yep sorry to block your heads and you'd be amazed you know you a person can pretend to write off
[03:08:28.960 --> 03:08:35.440]  the certification because it's peer reviewed monitored but every single farm follows the
[03:08:35.440 --> 03:08:42.800]  rules they have a karmic connection to the certification they're keeping their own
[03:08:45.200 --> 03:08:52.800]  resources like their own toxicity tests they have all the backing and if they ever veer off that the
[03:08:52.800 --> 03:09:01.360]  community we get 12 dms the minute and if someone tries if someone tries to put out a butane extract
[03:09:01.360 --> 03:09:05.600]  i mean literally we're going to hear about it within 30 minutes of it getting put on a shelf
[03:09:05.600 --> 03:09:13.440]  or getting put online so it's way more effective than getting by on a certification when you know
[03:09:13.440 --> 03:09:18.960]  the inspector's coming and you just hide your shit you know yeah and it only comes one time
[03:09:19.520 --> 03:09:25.680]  as opposed to your neighbor who actually knows all of your growing practices for the past 25
[03:09:25.680 --> 03:09:30.800]  years and it's already been slinging your weed maybe you've been working together you already
[03:09:30.800 --> 03:09:37.440]  know if that person has not paid trimmers who has not been an upstanding person because also to be
[03:09:37.440 --> 03:09:43.760]  dem pure is to be upstanding with the people that work for you you you know this is important and we
[03:09:43.840 --> 03:09:49.040]  know that that can be hard sometimes so we recognize that there's no perfect situation
[03:09:49.040 --> 03:09:55.600]  for sure and in some cases some people have felt they've had a hard time but so the goal is that
[03:09:55.600 --> 03:10:00.240]  we have an ethics committee and we're and we're working on communicating with everyone to make
[03:10:00.240 --> 03:10:08.160]  that workspace better and find the right team to go with the right garden and the right farmer
[03:10:08.160 --> 03:10:13.760]  and then that ethics team is just chosen from everybody the whole community can just
[03:10:14.400 --> 03:10:20.400]  volunteer and say yeah i could step up and be a part of that and be helpful so and in the kitchen
[03:10:20.400 --> 03:10:25.200]  of that farm and that you know they're gonna have clean you know products and they're gonna
[03:10:25.200 --> 03:10:36.230]  have healthy food and fridge that type of thing well we've been on for three hours and 10 minutes
[03:10:37.190 --> 03:10:42.310]  how's everybody feeling i'm pretty high right now yeah sorry i feel like i'm
[03:10:42.310 --> 03:10:45.270]  commandeering the conversation but i'm like i got questions
[03:10:47.430 --> 03:10:54.790]  ryan's clearly stoned every show buddy every show uh this is my time to get away from you know
[03:10:54.790 --> 03:10:58.790]  parent responsibilities and all that so i definitely enjoy myself on the shows
[03:10:59.350 --> 03:11:05.110]  but i will also tip of the hat to you guys uh dragonfly because there are you know we are
[03:11:05.110 --> 03:11:09.910]  interviewing someone each and every week but there's very few times where it seems like a ton
[03:11:09.910 --> 03:11:15.350]  of people want to pick your brain and you saw how giddy peter was getting so the whole community is
[03:11:15.350 --> 03:11:20.070]  just appreciative of you guys continuing to take your time you're on it seems like every single
[03:11:20.070 --> 03:11:24.790]  podcast so just kudos to you for going out there and just spreading the the information because
[03:11:24.790 --> 03:11:30.230]  that is the only way that we're going to combat major ag major ranching and that kind of thing
[03:11:30.230 --> 03:11:34.950]  is to educate where uh especially our children where their food comes from where the meat comes
[03:11:35.030 --> 03:11:40.790]  from and what is uh not only uh grass-fed but grass finished that's something else that i learned
[03:11:40.790 --> 03:11:48.710]  that's extremely important the term grass fed is interesting in canada you'll see grass-fed
[03:11:48.710 --> 03:11:55.350]  neat but then you read what the requirements are for grass fed and it's weird the grass has to be
[03:11:55.350 --> 03:12:04.710]  sprayed so they're spraying it with glyphosate to not have weeds which we know are really healthy
[03:12:04.710 --> 03:12:12.390]  for the cows so again here we are know your source know your certifications you know don't
[03:12:12.390 --> 03:12:18.470]  entrust and think that oh there's no way that a person would follow rules and guidelines if
[03:12:18.470 --> 03:12:26.790]  they're usda well they're certainly not following very many organic things if they're usda unless
[03:12:26.790 --> 03:12:33.750]  they're just going on their own uh education and their own practices that are above and beyond
[03:12:33.750 --> 03:12:41.270]  what usda asks for and certainly what omri asks for which is just a registration you can pretty
[03:12:41.270 --> 03:12:45.910]  much count on by the time it gets to a federal registration that it's been altered and it's not
[03:12:45.910 --> 03:12:51.190]  what you think it is so it's really it's just up to you you gotta find you gotta find the source and
[03:12:51.190 --> 03:12:58.470]  get get more more into it so that grass-fed beef and grass should be an amazing thing if you fall
[03:12:58.470 --> 03:13:09.830]  all salads and all farm the type regenerative farming you know of course grass-fed beef is good
[03:13:09.830 --> 03:13:19.590]  for you you know but then if wait just to just to clarify though did you say that grass-fed in canada
[03:13:19.590 --> 03:13:27.110]  it's a requirement that you spray it or that you're allowed to spray it you're allowed to spray i i
[03:13:28.070 --> 03:13:35.030]  please community correct me if i'm wrong but it i what i've seen is it's a requirement
[03:13:36.390 --> 03:13:42.310]  that your grass has to be sprayed so i would that's insane about that yeah please that's
[03:13:42.310 --> 03:13:49.510]  like a horrific it's like what people are expecting expecting to eat what they actually
[03:13:49.510 --> 03:13:56.150]  get to eat are two very different things so that's the case and this this is this would be
[03:13:56.150 --> 03:14:04.310]  this type of thing would be rooted in mad cow disease style fear when you're trading meat
[03:14:04.310 --> 03:14:10.790]  over borders on a on a large corporate scale so when you have corporate scale trading you know
[03:14:10.790 --> 03:14:17.830]  it's it's easy to to get toxicity in there so you know smaller intentional farms that are growing
[03:14:17.830 --> 03:14:22.550]  like that this is just not part of their they don't even need to speak like you know in that
[03:14:22.550 --> 03:14:27.830]  type of way where they're no one would spray their ever spray their grass uh-huh and we talk
[03:14:27.830 --> 03:14:34.870]  a lot about you know this pandemic that's going on and involving a virus and then it involving a lot
[03:14:34.870 --> 03:14:41.990]  of different uh backlashes or laws or regulations or mandates or whatever you want to call it
[03:14:41.990 --> 03:14:47.510]  whether you believe in it or not or whatever it is definitely happening and we're talking about
[03:14:47.510 --> 03:14:54.150]  it being sort of the first time for us well if you've been involved in the meat industry
[03:14:54.150 --> 03:15:01.030]  it certainly has not been the first time for the meat industry because it is not the first time that
[03:15:01.030 --> 03:15:11.510]  an entire industry has been totally upheavaled and controlled and totally regulated due to a
[03:15:12.230 --> 03:15:21.830]  virus that was very very very low counts blown up out of proportion farmers who study these things
[03:15:21.830 --> 03:15:27.590]  and are now studying what's going on in this pandemic you know it doesn't matter which
[03:15:27.590 --> 03:15:36.630]  side you stand on it you will definitely find incredible similarities yeah exactly if not i
[03:15:37.590 --> 03:15:43.190]  so this is your best case scenario your worst case scenario is they're actually mandated to
[03:15:43.190 --> 03:15:49.990]  spray it best case is it got sprayed on the neighbor's farm which is still bad just the
[03:15:49.990 --> 03:15:58.070]  alberta beef so look up alberta beef on the comment that i'm making right now and again i
[03:15:58.070 --> 03:16:05.350]  hope i'm i'm right about this but this you know a and w is the kind of you know they sell green
[03:16:06.150 --> 03:16:12.550]  burgers right they're grass washing wow there's a huge line out of all the a and w you know burger
[03:16:12.550 --> 03:16:18.390]  places in british columbia they're all from grass-fed beef but you read the requirements
[03:16:18.390 --> 03:16:24.630]  and then you start oh okay well it's a corporate style grass-fed anyway glyphosate sprayed glyphosate
[03:16:24.630 --> 03:16:33.190]  is one of them of the herbs but dicamba and other defoliants are also commonly used and i please
[03:16:33.190 --> 03:16:42.710]  everyone look up zach bush and all of his work on the gut microbiome glyphosate and the future
[03:16:42.710 --> 03:16:54.070]  of our genome and gener and how glyphosate affects future generations we don't even there's not
[03:16:54.070 --> 03:17:00.230]  studies on this so it's willy-nilly well everyone's out willy-nilly eating if you drink beer you have
[03:17:00.230 --> 03:17:05.190]  to be careful it has to be organic we said this i'm pretty sure on the last one if you're not
[03:17:05.190 --> 03:17:10.310]  drinking organic beer you're drinking fermented glyphosate and that's extremely harmful to you
[03:17:11.030 --> 03:17:19.270]  and not only that but it goes back to what we were talking about at the beginning is that
[03:17:19.590 --> 03:17:29.670]  it's isolated science that's coming at us in as many different forms as it possibly can
[03:17:29.670 --> 03:17:37.590]  even when it's unbeknownst to us so then you just got to step back and wonder what in the fuck is
[03:17:37.590 --> 03:17:47.270]  happening if we're getting it in language that's fooling us in in ingredients that are fooling us
[03:17:47.350 --> 03:17:56.470]  in new laws and legislations that are fooling us everything is fooling us to get more toxicities
[03:17:56.470 --> 03:18:04.230]  in us it's just interesting i'm not going to draw a conclusion to this i'm just pointing it out
[03:18:05.670 --> 03:18:12.550]  and i think that so much of what we've talked about today and the incredible malady of the
[03:18:12.950 --> 03:18:18.470]  malady of the human microbiome is
[03:18:21.030 --> 03:18:21.910]  everything
[03:18:24.390 --> 03:18:32.310]  has come from the industrialized era or of the mind of a human being to isolate it in science
[03:18:33.750 --> 03:18:40.550]  is breaking down that health and well-being is breaking down the very structure that gives us
[03:18:40.550 --> 03:18:50.070]  health and wellness it's a snake eating its tail and we continue to be a part of a snake eating
[03:18:50.070 --> 03:18:58.870]  its tail so having these conversations and you guys pushing forward these conversations
[03:18:59.910 --> 03:19:06.070]  once a week i mean that's amazing that is incredible pure dedication sure brian you can
[03:19:06.070 --> 03:19:12.390]  say that it's getting away from your family but that's incredible dedication towards
[03:19:13.350 --> 03:19:21.670]  injecting and i did choose my words properly injecting the population with beneficials
[03:19:23.430 --> 03:19:26.550]  and if we all can do little parts and pieces of this
[03:19:27.430 --> 03:19:31.190]  then we realize that these kind of things are closed loops
[03:19:31.830 --> 03:19:37.430]  towards our health and wellness and everything else is trying to attack that
[03:19:38.310 --> 03:19:45.350]  i just think it's interesting so should i leave this conversation optimistic and upbeat or
[03:19:45.350 --> 03:19:54.230]  depressed and sad you didn't look you didn't learn a thing either upbeat buddy positivity
[03:19:54.310 --> 03:19:55.190]  positivity
[03:19:57.750 --> 03:20:03.030]  i will say positive vibrations every time every time there is something to your vibration your
[03:20:03.030 --> 03:20:08.150]  energy however you want to put it but when you start to realize that again i think that does
[03:20:08.150 --> 03:20:13.430]  come back from just feeling healthy and then days just get a you know when you wake up in the morning
[03:20:13.430 --> 03:20:18.950]  you kind of spring out of bed a little bit each day just atomic habits i don't know if you guys
[03:20:19.270 --> 03:20:24.390]  read that book but these little changes like one percent two percent those add up over the years and
[03:20:25.110 --> 03:20:28.710]  that's what i think really comes back when you when you start to focus on your health
[03:20:28.710 --> 03:20:37.670]  just a little bit i have a totally random story but uh at the end of the uh that weekend at heart
[03:20:37.670 --> 03:20:46.790]  rock in humble my poos were like the most spectacularly health like i looked at my poos
[03:20:46.790 --> 03:20:54.070]  and i was like there's some good stuff going on in there and like i feel bad that this is wasted
[03:20:54.070 --> 03:20:59.350]  down the toilet like i don't know if everybody else had that same like looking back and being
[03:20:59.350 --> 03:21:05.190]  like whoa like like patting yourself on the back and all the food i mean that food the food was all
[03:21:05.190 --> 03:21:11.670]  just like all the farmers brought the food they grew on their farms and that's like what the chef
[03:21:11.670 --> 03:21:18.870]  had as like all right i got tons of sweet potatoes from this farm and tons of corn from that farm
[03:21:18.870 --> 03:21:27.190]  and that's all we ate and and it was reflected on the other end uh in in my opinion in a very
[03:21:27.190 --> 03:21:34.390]  spectacular way good in good and we had the seed mandala at the seed mandala at the end for everyone
[03:21:34.390 --> 03:21:39.670]  to take seeds from you know a lot of the food that we ate we ended up i didn't even know that
[03:21:39.670 --> 03:21:46.230]  was i had no idea that i would have definitely taken seeds yeah it was really great we all brought
[03:21:46.230 --> 03:21:52.230]  seeds formed a mandala and then took handfuls out of it once it was totally created that was really
[03:21:52.230 --> 03:21:57.430]  fun and we'll do it again we're gonna have these things again we're gonna open it up we're gonna
[03:21:57.430 --> 03:22:03.350]  have campouts to where you know we can invite and have more people to where it isn't you know
[03:22:04.230 --> 03:22:10.390]  that'd be like woodstock yeah we're bringing back the old old world we're just hanging out we're
[03:22:10.390 --> 03:22:17.510]  camping we're smoking weed we're making our own food over fires and we're just communicating you
[03:22:17.510 --> 03:22:23.830]  know that's going to be the next revelation of where we're headed once things change and things
[03:22:23.830 --> 03:22:30.390]  open up and also um you know we're going to be opening up more conversations for health and
[03:22:30.390 --> 03:22:35.430]  well-being and we definitely want people to reach out during our live conversations
[03:22:36.070 --> 03:22:42.070]  because or watch them because so much of what we've been talking about today um sort of goes
[03:22:42.070 --> 03:22:47.670]  over in details and also other people have come on and asked their own questions which people might
[03:22:47.670 --> 03:22:55.350]  be able to get some information from so we just want to continue this beautiful vibe of community
[03:22:55.350 --> 03:23:04.550]  learning and community you know gathering together to to gain truth and healing and love
[03:23:04.550 --> 03:23:14.710]  and and vibration upward and transform competition into inspiration yes and create unity out of
[03:23:14.790 --> 03:23:26.550]  community and thrive and turn shit the shitty part of what we don't like right now the shit shit
[03:23:26.550 --> 03:23:36.150]  into compost and into wellness all shit turns into something vital when managed properly but
[03:23:36.150 --> 03:23:44.790]  i don't like the word managed so much so when stewarded properly yeah when properly guided
[03:23:46.310 --> 03:23:51.590]  bullshit's your best friend yeah we always say that when people say that's bullshit we're like
[03:23:51.590 --> 03:23:58.310]  yay that must be good that's bullshit wow thank you
[03:23:58.870 --> 03:24:06.220]  do you guys do word play in the bedroom too the word play never
[03:24:08.220 --> 03:24:14.940]  you should see the word play while high on plant medicine oh you see that kind of stuff will be the
[03:24:14.940 --> 03:24:19.180]  stuff that happens at the campouts that everyone can be a part of and we can all
[03:24:19.820 --> 03:24:25.580]  laugh until we just want to pee our pants we're going that's the very basic human we're trying to
[03:24:25.820 --> 03:24:31.020]  hurt our sides our sides need to hurt from laughing what was the last time right like you
[03:24:31.020 --> 03:24:37.660]  needed to hurt i want to see pain in the sides and when your cheeks they hurt from laughing too much
[03:24:37.660 --> 03:24:42.220]  you don't know what your face is making because you've been laughing hysterically forgot what it
[03:24:42.220 --> 03:24:46.620]  is that you were laughing about because you're just laughing because laughter is fucking funny
[03:24:46.620 --> 03:24:53.580]  yeah and the funny is the beginning of fungi and fungi is the essence of life and so
[03:24:53.980 --> 03:25:03.020]  laughing so hard you shart you know you hear it bring it as full circle back to the i sharded uh

[03:25:12.140 --> 03:25:20.220]  everything's an opportunity so go turn opposition into an opportunity and i and i really
[03:25:20.300 --> 03:25:28.140]  encourage people out there right now i feel like we've been living in a time of our tragedies a
[03:25:28.140 --> 03:25:35.740]  time of our difficulties we bring it out in our everyday life i believe that there is time for
[03:25:36.300 --> 03:25:45.260]  difficulty to work through it and i also believe that maybe as humans we can start letting go
[03:25:45.260 --> 03:25:54.460]  as humans we can start letting go a lot of of those things which are no longer serving us
[03:25:54.460 --> 03:26:03.820]  anymore things that are no longer serving us i think we can let go of breathe it out
[03:26:04.460 --> 03:26:12.700]  because there's a new fresh reality coming on we can't deny it and we have to create the
[03:26:12.700 --> 03:26:20.620]  environment for it to propagate and and work so that's what we're doing today give thanks for the
[03:26:20.620 --> 03:26:29.020]  process give thanks for the journey and reach out if you need a little help yeah and we're open and
