[00:13.180 --> 00:17.980]  Hey everybody, good afternoon and happy Saturday to you. We're back here with
[00:17.980 --> 00:23.440]  another episode of the Friendly Cannabis Show and we have a wonderful guest with
[00:23.440 --> 00:28.460]  us today. We are joined by Madam Cannoli. How are you doing today?
[00:28.460 --> 00:33.780]  Fine, thank you for having me. Yeah, it's absolutely my pleasure and I appreciate
[00:33.780 --> 00:37.820]  you making the time too because you've been pretty busy. You've been going city
[00:37.820 --> 00:44.980]  to city lately revealing the new movies are premiering a new film titled
[00:44.980 --> 00:49.740]  Frenchie Dreams of Hasheesh. Do you think you can maybe tell us a little bit
[00:49.740 --> 00:54.940]  about the movie and possibly the journey to get that produced? So this was
[00:54.940 --> 01:01.100]  Frenchie's little love letter to the the farmers of the Emerald Triangle that he
[01:01.100 --> 01:07.300]  worked with. It was filmed with the filmmaker Jake Remington over the
[01:07.300 --> 01:14.500]  transition from 2017 to 2018 which marked the end of medical cannabis in
[01:14.500 --> 01:19.420]  California and the beginning of recreational or what's also known as
[01:19.420 --> 01:26.260]  adult use. And so Frenchie would go every year around harvest time up
[01:26.260 --> 01:30.860]  north to work with the farmers to see how how things were going, you know kind
[01:30.940 --> 01:37.780]  of what he had to look forward to. And those two seasons Jake tagged along and
[01:37.780 --> 01:45.780]  filmed some of those encounters and the transition that occurred as California
[01:45.780 --> 01:51.340]  went through that kind of historic period of moving into so-called legal
[01:51.340 --> 01:57.340]  cannabis. And that's you know that's kind of one of those wonderful things. You go
[01:57.340 --> 02:01.020]  around with the camera for two years not necessarily knowing what's gonna
[02:01.020 --> 02:06.700]  come of it other than you just need to document these things. And then you know
[02:06.700 --> 02:11.060]  the editing is I mean two years worth of film to edit that's always going to be a
[02:11.060 --> 02:16.660]  challenge. How did the production side of things go for you once you've collected
[02:16.660 --> 02:21.660]  all this footage you just sat there and said you know what now or did you guys
[02:21.660 --> 02:26.020]  actually have a goal? Well initially we were thinking it would be a series
[02:26.180 --> 02:34.700]  because we have a tremendous amount of footage and we we were led by a couple
[02:34.700 --> 02:40.220]  of people who felt that they could be producers and get us to a place where a
[02:40.220 --> 02:46.380]  large audience could see it through one of the streaming platforms and three
[02:46.380 --> 02:50.940]  twists and turns that didn't work out. You know I think a lot of times people
[02:51.100 --> 02:56.740]  promise a little beyond what they actually can do and so we had a kind of
[02:56.740 --> 03:04.700]  five-year transition and during that period the pandemic hit. And so during
[03:04.700 --> 03:10.180]  the pandemic Jake was able to take a more serious look at what we had put
[03:10.180 --> 03:14.780]  together and through some discussions with Frenchy it was decided to create a
[03:14.780 --> 03:21.500]  feature film instead of a series. And so that's what Jake did during the
[03:21.500 --> 03:28.660]  pandemic. He kind of narrowed the conversation down from seven individual
[03:28.660 --> 03:34.980]  episodes into one 90 minute feature length film that becomes a dialogue with
[03:34.980 --> 03:42.220]  Frenchy and these farmers and tells the story of Frenchy's you know love for
[03:42.220 --> 03:48.220]  working with these this group of regenerative outdoor sun-grown farmers
[03:48.220 --> 03:53.660]  and the material the plants that they they grew and his quest for the highest
[03:53.660 --> 03:58.780]  quality hashish that could be made which was his lifelong quest. And so that's a
[03:58.780 --> 04:03.380]  little bit where the title comes from for anybody who's seen the film Jiro
[04:03.380 --> 04:10.700]  Dreams of Sushi. In the film often the people who work with Jiro they ask him
[04:10.700 --> 04:16.620]  so Jiro today did you make the perfect sushi? And Jiro would always say we could
[04:16.620 --> 04:21.820]  do better maybe tomorrow. And so that was a running joke we had with Frenchy's
[04:21.820 --> 04:27.580]  apprentice Bell and I we would say to Frenchy so this batch of hashish is it
[04:27.580 --> 04:32.660]  the perfect batch of hashish? And Frenchy would always say it's pretty good but I
[04:32.660 --> 04:39.340]  think we could do better. And so yeah this is a little bit of a nod to that
[04:39.380 --> 04:45.940]  Japanese culture of artisanal you know kind of striving for perfection that's
[04:45.940 --> 04:51.260]  never quite there. That you're always honing your craft you're always seeking
[04:51.260 --> 04:55.780]  furtherance of your talent and your ability and you don't rest on your
[04:55.780 --> 05:02.780]  laurels. Yeah. Which which would have been easy for him to do but you know I
[05:02.780 --> 05:07.540]  appreciate that constant you know evolution. I'm an audio engineer by
[05:07.620 --> 05:12.700]  trade. I also love gardening. Music and gardening you're never going to know at
[05:12.700 --> 05:16.140]  all. There will always be something you can improve even if you don't know that
[05:16.140 --> 05:20.740]  you could improve on it. So I understand that sentiment. I haven't heard it in
[05:20.740 --> 05:26.020]  that context before but I love it. Well and that's in part why Frenchy
[05:26.020 --> 05:32.420]  consciously took an apprentice in Laura Bell known as Cherry Blossom Bell on
[05:32.540 --> 05:38.020]  Instagram. She lived and worked with us for seven years. She was side-by-side day
[05:38.020 --> 05:43.780]  in day out with Frenchy and as he liked to say he passed down all of his
[05:43.780 --> 05:48.660]  knowledge to her fully understanding that she was going to be able to go
[05:48.660 --> 05:52.820]  forward into a future where there would be more scientific information
[05:52.820 --> 05:57.140]  available to her. More process information available to her. You know
[05:57.140 --> 06:03.260]  she's not living under that stigma or needing to hide what she's doing to the
[06:03.260 --> 06:07.300]  degree that we had to do when we were young. So he was very excited both
[06:07.300 --> 06:13.020]  through Bell and through other students who attended his workshop where they
[06:13.020 --> 06:17.340]  would take it. I mean when you look in California especially at some of the
[06:17.340 --> 06:25.100]  larger manufacturers in many cases the senior hash maker worked with Frenchy
[06:25.100 --> 06:31.900]  in some kind of student collaborative situation at one point or another. So
[06:31.900 --> 06:36.740]  yeah Frenchy was very excited to be able to pass on the knowledge and especially
[06:36.740 --> 06:42.260]  through Jake's help we also created a series a four-part series of do-it-yourself
[06:42.260 --> 06:47.860]  videos to make that available for free to people who can't attend our
[06:47.860 --> 06:52.380]  workshops or who are in a country where it just wouldn't be feasible to study
[06:52.500 --> 06:57.420]  this in an open way. And a beautiful thing happened after Frenchy's passing. A
[06:57.420 --> 07:03.100]  group from Brazil reached out to me they're called Overgrowth Shop and asked
[07:03.100 --> 07:07.700]  if they could translate the subtitles to Frenchy's videos this do-it-yourself
[07:07.700 --> 07:13.020]  videos into Portuguese. And I said yes of course I you know be honored if they
[07:13.020 --> 07:17.040]  would do that. And they also happen to be filmmakers so they had the software to
[07:17.040 --> 07:22.200]  perfectly match up the subtitles to the speaking points in the in the videos. And
[07:22.200 --> 07:27.600]  so when I did that Frenchy has a Lost Art group on Facebook to support people
[07:27.600 --> 07:32.240]  in their learning of the traditional hash making processes. I told everybody
[07:32.240 --> 07:37.400]  hey if you speak Portuguese now the videos are available in Portuguese. Well
[07:37.400 --> 07:41.560]  so then I had the French that were like well if the Portuguese have done it
[07:41.560 --> 07:45.960]  we're gonna do it too. So and then the Italians were like well if the French
[07:45.960 --> 07:50.560]  are gonna do it we're gonna do it. And so now I find myself with six languages.
[07:50.560 --> 07:54.400]  We have English because of course Frenchy needed English translation.
[07:54.400 --> 08:00.080]  Portuguese, Spanish, French, Italian, and German. And then after this New York trip
[08:00.080 --> 08:06.000]  I have volunteers that have offered to do Chinese and Hebrew. So that'll be
[08:06.000 --> 08:13.540]  pretty cool. That is amazing. That is such a door opening opportunity for areas of
[08:13.540 --> 08:18.720]  the world that you know are not as advanced in this information and the
[08:18.720 --> 08:24.640]  techniques and the cultivation as we are in you know safer locations. And it's an
[08:24.640 --> 08:29.880]  opportunity in some cases to give back to producing locations where the
[08:29.880 --> 08:35.180]  information has been lost a little bit. I know Frenchy used to exchange
[08:35.180 --> 08:40.860]  conversations with people on Instagram through a DM or in other you know
[08:40.900 --> 08:45.780]  functionalities. And one time when he was driving up to Humboldt he was talking I
[08:45.780 --> 08:51.180]  think via Skype or something to a gentleman in Lebanon who was making
[08:51.180 --> 08:56.600]  hashish for the first time and had lost some of the details. And so Frenchy was
[08:56.600 --> 09:00.820]  able to kind of guide him into understanding some of the science and
[09:00.820 --> 09:05.540]  remind him of some of the traditional methodology. And so it's pretty exciting
[09:05.820 --> 09:11.660]  to see that come full circle to be able to you know give back to countries that
[09:11.660 --> 09:17.620]  had inspired him in the past. Yeah so it's pretty lovely. Absolutely and there
[09:17.620 --> 09:20.620]  is kind of you know I'm mentioning you know other areas of the world where
[09:20.620 --> 09:25.380]  there's a you know kind of the desert of information. But almost when it comes to
[09:25.380 --> 09:30.380]  you know traditional hash and traditional hash making the US is kind
[09:30.420 --> 09:36.180]  of a desert as far as it was as far as information goes and just traditional
[09:36.180 --> 09:42.100]  hash. I like to travel to Amsterdam and was there a few months ago. And one of
[09:42.100 --> 09:46.500]  the things that I love about being there is the hash that you can get at the
[09:46.500 --> 09:52.140]  coffee shops which is not anything like I can get in a store here. So I always
[09:52.140 --> 09:57.100]  kind of found that interesting too. And another reason why I appreciate all the
[09:57.100 --> 10:02.340]  information there are there's a lot of top quality extract artists that I'm
[10:02.340 --> 10:08.460]  very familiar with that. Yeah they give a lot of credit to Frenchy and his work
[10:08.460 --> 10:14.860]  and the inspiration and the education really. I think when it comes to hashish
[10:14.860 --> 10:22.540]  in the US you know the war on drugs was very effective. The feds you know the
[10:22.540 --> 10:31.020]  Brotherhood of Eternal Love members and other people who were bringing large
[10:31.020 --> 10:36.700]  quantities into the US in the 70s and 80s and effectively stopped that pipeline.
[10:36.700 --> 10:42.300]  So we have a couple generations of young people that didn't grow up exposed to
[10:42.300 --> 10:48.420]  traditional hashish. And we have an issue in North America with this I think a
[10:48.420 --> 10:54.340]  subculture within the cannabis community that has appropriated labeling
[10:54.340 --> 11:00.740]  hash as almost any kind of concentrate. So people are very confused as to what
[11:00.740 --> 11:07.700]  is traditional hashish. And traditional hashish is loose resin that has been
[11:07.700 --> 11:13.460]  gathered via a sieving process from the dried and cured plant material. And then
[11:13.500 --> 11:18.620]  it's pressed with a source of heat into a mass. So breaking those trichrome heads
[11:18.620 --> 11:24.460]  so that they become a mass. And that mass is traditional hashish. And this is not
[11:24.460 --> 11:30.180]  to be confused with what we find in India which is charas. And charas is
[11:30.180 --> 11:37.940]  concentrate that is retrieved by hand rubbing live plants. And then taking that
[11:37.940 --> 11:42.340]  resin that's already been pressed because when as you rub it it's pressing
[11:42.340 --> 11:47.260]  the material together and it's making the resin come together. And then if you
[11:47.260 --> 11:52.420]  use your thumb because the material is sticky you can retrieve it from your
[11:52.420 --> 11:56.860]  hand and then roll it. Traditionally they rolled it into a long finger and it's
[11:56.860 --> 12:02.860]  stored kind of as the fingers one next to the other. But that's not something
[12:02.860 --> 12:07.900]  you find very rarely in the States. Nobody has time to do something like that.
[12:07.900 --> 12:12.940]  The closest I get to that is if you trim and you don't put your gloves on.
[12:12.940 --> 12:18.540]  Yes. By the end of trimming you're just kind of like yeah all right. Get it off.
[12:18.540 --> 12:24.300]  But that's probably not the top quality. But closest I've come to it. May have a
[12:24.300 --> 12:28.980]  little bit of plant contaminant. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Now you know terminology. I'm
[12:28.980 --> 12:33.580]  huge on terminology. I'm glad that you just brought that up. One word that I
[12:33.700 --> 12:40.260]  think gets misunderstood or misused is keef. I was gonna say. And that's my pet
[12:40.260 --> 12:46.260]  peep you know. And I see it so widely used for so many different things. It
[12:46.260 --> 12:52.060]  feels very frustrating because this is a word that has a documented history of at
[12:52.060 --> 12:58.860]  least 200 years in North Africa. You can find it in both English and French texts.
[12:58.860 --> 13:08.380]  And it refers to a mixture of chopped cannabis flower with chopped black
[13:08.380 --> 13:14.260]  tobacco that's smoked in a very long stem pipe with a small clay bowl called
[13:14.260 --> 13:19.940]  a sebzi. And that is what traditional keef is. It has nothing to do with the
[13:19.940 --> 13:23.940]  loose resin and chopped up flower bits you're finding in the bottom of your
[13:23.940 --> 13:33.380]  grinder. It has nothing to do with any kind of loose resin that is a process of
[13:33.700 --> 13:38.180]  you know traditional hash making either before the material is pressed. And I
[13:38.180 --> 13:42.820]  think it's it's funny because I was at the Grow Up conference last week and it
[13:42.820 --> 13:48.340]  came up and one of the conference the conference moderator moderator said
[13:48.340 --> 13:54.180]  something to the effect of we're a subculture and we make our own vocabulary.
[13:54.180 --> 13:58.620]  We basically we can do what we want. And part of me was like sure go ahead do
[13:58.620 --> 14:02.380]  what you want. But do you want to be understood or do you want to be
[14:02.460 --> 14:08.980]  confrontational. Because if you want to be confrontational yeah go ahead. But it
[14:08.980 --> 14:14.980]  doesn't really help us understand each other. And my point to him was if I if we
[14:14.980 --> 14:21.380]  were doing interstate commerce and I ordered traditional hashish from you and
[14:21.380 --> 14:26.700]  you sent me rosin because you know both of them are often labeled as hash. I
[14:26.700 --> 14:31.740]  would be kind of upset because that those that's almost like if I ordered
[14:31.740 --> 14:38.020]  apple juice from you and you sent me applesauce. Not at all the same use both
[14:38.020 --> 14:43.700]  delightful byproducts of apples but you know probably widely different
[14:43.700 --> 14:50.020]  consumption needs. So yeah I think we really need to work on this. I know that
[14:50.020 --> 14:55.940]  there have been some studies done by the U.N. as we approach a time when cannabis
[14:55.940 --> 15:00.620]  is going to be legal worldwide and there will potentially be inter-country
[15:00.620 --> 15:05.180]  commerce around this. There's going to need to be a standardized lexicon.
[15:05.620 --> 15:10.980]  Normally when they look at this they look at medical pharmacopeia because
[15:10.980 --> 15:15.300]  these this is something that's very standardized. And when you look even at
[15:15.300 --> 15:19.660]  that right now country to country there's such a huge variance. There was a
[15:19.660 --> 15:29.260]  very interesting study done by a man named. Hold on one second. It's on our
[15:30.100 --> 15:35.340]  on our website. I always forget his name.
[15:36.300 --> 15:40.940]  And I've got everybody to down in the show notes. We've got the Instagrams as
[15:40.940 --> 15:44.900]  well as the website. So definitely check that out. I hope we're going to cover a
[15:44.900 --> 15:49.500]  few of the things on the website but holy cow. Talk about a resource center.
[15:50.140 --> 15:55.340]  Frenchy Canoey dot com is pretty freaking awesome. Yeah I thought I had
[15:55.420 --> 15:59.780]  added it to the website multiple times because I refer to it so much but I'm not
[15:59.780 --> 16:03.940]  seeing it here right now. I'll have to get it for you later. But there was a
[16:03.940 --> 16:09.660]  study commissioned by the U.N. and a French cannabis activist and researcher
[16:09.660 --> 16:18.260]  who lives in Barcelona did the work. It took three years to do this comparison
[16:18.260 --> 16:24.700]  of these various pharmacopeia. And it's very interesting reading to just see.
[16:25.140 --> 16:29.700]  It's going to be quite a challenge to untangle and try to come to some
[16:29.700 --> 16:38.380]  consensus on terminology beyond this kind of island of culture that we find in
[16:38.540 --> 16:44.460]  North America. It doesn't seem very interested in coming to any consensus.
[16:44.980 --> 16:49.140]  No I always I always kind of joke and you know a lot of people do too. It's like
[16:49.300 --> 16:53.980]  there's cannabis and then there's botany and they're really both the same thing
[16:53.980 --> 16:59.260]  but they don't mix. And yeah as we move forward as this becomes more of a
[16:59.260 --> 17:03.780]  commodity or you know can be exported and travel the world we are going to have
[17:03.780 --> 17:08.300]  to have this common language. I mean just even parts of the plants like stigma
[17:08.300 --> 17:15.820]  versus pistol Bract versus the harlequins versus pollen. Guess what. You go or
[17:15.820 --> 17:20.940]  crystals people referring to the trichomes as crystals. And I understand those older
[17:20.940 --> 17:25.980]  Europeans when we were young and we were traveling and producing countries we
[17:25.980 --> 17:29.700]  didn't have the terminology because we didn't have access to that science. We
[17:29.700 --> 17:34.140]  couldn't go to the library and say I want to check out a book on cannabis. That
[17:34.140 --> 17:40.700]  was a kind of prudent thing to do at the time. But now that we've been exposed to
[17:40.700 --> 17:46.180]  more science and that we have access to some of even the really old traditional
[17:46.180 --> 17:51.220]  books that were written before the war on drugs that did have appropriate labeling.
[17:51.780 --> 18:02.420]  I think we know better. So what's the excuse then. Yeah I again it's it's this thing of I
[18:02.420 --> 18:10.340]  guess clarity versus almost like culture and I understand within cultures you adapt
[18:10.340 --> 18:15.660]  slang you adapt different ways of referring to things. So maybe it will be like there's a
[18:15.660 --> 18:21.620]  commercial language scientific language and then everybody else will do just whatever they
[18:21.620 --> 18:26.780]  want. I like how you broke that down though because that does explain it. It really is just
[18:26.780 --> 18:30.940]  a culture thing. You know it may not be correct but when we say it we all know what we're
[18:30.940 --> 18:38.020]  talking about. But that's within the culture. I can't tell you how many times people have
[18:38.020 --> 18:43.420]  said hash to me and shown me rosa and I've kind of been like I'm sorry but this is not
[18:43.500 --> 18:52.180]  hashish. Yeah. Do you see a lot of focus. OK. Do you see a lot of younger people who you know
[18:52.340 --> 18:58.260]  grew up with the concentrates of the rosa and then you know the B.H.O. and all of that. Do
[18:58.260 --> 19:06.220]  you find them hungry for this information or to kind of differentiate and learn more or less
[19:06.220 --> 19:12.500]  the roots really of where they're from. Age difference because I see like in the last part of
[19:12.500 --> 19:19.300]  the hashish in Facebook group that's dedicated it's a learning community. So we only do posts
[19:19.300 --> 19:24.860]  and topics that are related to learning about the science of cannabis especially as it
[19:24.860 --> 19:32.100]  pertains to hash making the people in that group are very interested in expanding their
[19:32.100 --> 19:38.620]  understanding. And I don't really have a sense that there's like a certain age range that is one
[19:38.620 --> 19:46.620]  thing or another. I think it's just people who love science and who love botany and books and
[19:46.620 --> 19:54.220]  information are very interested in the definition of things frequently as well because within the
[19:54.220 --> 20:00.220]  scientific community I think there's more of a standardization. There's an understanding that we
[20:00.220 --> 20:06.220]  need a standardization to be able to effectively communicate ideas that we're both on the same
[20:06.220 --> 20:11.900]  page as far as the definition so that we can understand what's being discussed.
[20:12.940 --> 20:19.340]  That's encouraging to hear too because again if you don't learn the information if the
[20:19.340 --> 20:25.260]  information doesn't get passed on you stand a chance of losing the information. So to have
[20:25.260 --> 20:31.260]  people of all ages interested and intrigued and people who will carry it forward that's
[20:31.260 --> 20:38.060]  exciting to hear. I like that. No quite a few and you know just in his workshop Frenchy trained
[20:38.060 --> 20:44.780]  over a thousand people easily and those people some of those people have gone on to become
[20:44.780 --> 20:49.420]  really good teachers in their own right that are continuing to pass on the information.
[20:50.700 --> 20:58.300]  Yeah so it's pretty exciting. It's lovely actually. It is and you know Frenchy he gave us a gift that
[20:58.300 --> 21:05.420]  there really aren't enough words to describe but one of the things that seem to me to be very
[21:05.420 --> 21:12.460]  important to him is that you kind of continue on the education and spreading the word and really
[21:12.460 --> 21:18.860]  encouraging people to reach for their full potential whatever that may be and I believe
[21:18.860 --> 21:26.220]  the words were and I love this but follow your passion. Can you maybe tell us a little bit
[21:26.300 --> 21:33.980]  about your inspiration for continuing this work? Well Frenchy and I were together for 41 years
[21:34.940 --> 21:39.740]  so you know there's already that. These were projects that we were working on together.
[21:39.740 --> 21:46.140]  I was Frenchy's back office in you know everything that that he did. I was his proofreader
[21:47.100 --> 21:56.540]  for better or worse at that level and then you know I supported all the infrastructure around
[21:56.540 --> 22:03.580]  the film, around his upcoming book, around his workshops. After the first one you know we had
[22:03.580 --> 22:11.660]  somebody that helped with the first workshop and it was pretty much a disaster so I stepped in after
[22:11.660 --> 22:18.620]  and took that over for him to ensure that all he had to concentrate on was you know sharing the
[22:18.620 --> 22:25.500]  information and being Frenchy because I felt that was a very important message to the world and
[22:27.660 --> 22:33.260]  I had a strong sense you know at his untimely passing that I had been left with something
[22:33.260 --> 22:41.100]  very important to finish for him and yeah so that's just been my goal to make sure that
[22:42.220 --> 22:47.900]  that through his apprentice Belle we're able to continue doing some of the workshops as long as
[22:47.900 --> 22:54.460]  she would like to to do them and you know having her ultimately like he always intended be the
[22:54.460 --> 23:01.340]  repository of all that knowledge. Getting the film out there to as many people as possible so that
[23:01.340 --> 23:08.300]  people really understand that as Frenchy you know kind of said in the one quote that we are not the
[23:08.780 --> 23:14.940]  degenerates that you know kind of the war on drugs would have people believe when it comes
[23:14.940 --> 23:22.540]  to cannabis consumers that we are actually the creatives and the future of society in terms of
[23:23.100 --> 23:30.380]  forward thinking mindset about the environment, about human relations, about consuming plants
[23:30.380 --> 23:37.020]  that bring benefit to consciousness. So I think that's a very important message to get out there
[23:37.020 --> 23:44.700]  and to protect and people who see the film also realize that these farmers while they may be
[23:44.700 --> 23:51.020]  growing cannabis it's just another crop. They also grow other vegetables and they also have families
[23:51.020 --> 23:57.500]  who go to birthday parties and take their kids to school and just you know they're just normal human
[23:57.500 --> 24:04.860]  beings who live in these communities up north who have nurtured and protected this plant against
[24:04.860 --> 24:11.340]  you know huge odds for the last 80 years to the benefit of humanity. So this is something really
[24:11.340 --> 24:18.220]  important that they be given credit for that and that this wisdom be kind of respected and followed
[24:18.220 --> 24:23.900]  that these are these are now people who are becoming elders in the in the community little
[24:23.900 --> 24:31.260]  by little and they have a vision of what is healthy and hopeful for humanity that a lot of people it
[24:31.260 --> 24:36.620]  would really do them good to pay attention to. So I sincerely hope that I can create enough buzz
[24:36.620 --> 24:43.740]  around the film to get this picked up by one of the major streaming platforms to be a counterbalance
[24:43.740 --> 24:51.420]  to some of the stupid stoner content that's out there or the evil stoner content that's out there
[24:51.420 --> 24:57.020]  that that kind of perpetuates this myth that somehow you smoke cannabis and you become a
[24:57.020 --> 25:04.220]  murderer or something. Yeah I've never robbed or killed anybody for my cannabis habit. Most of us
[25:04.220 --> 25:13.180]  have not. Put it out there. Yeah yeah. You know I appreciate that so much. You know I mentioned
[25:13.180 --> 25:19.260]  audio engineer. I was a performer for many years. I was also a manager, talent manager for many years
[25:19.260 --> 25:26.700]  as well and when you get someone who has dedicated themselves and fully eat, sleeps, breathes what
[25:26.700 --> 25:33.340]  they do, they need a manager because they can't handle the back end. It's two different brains.
[25:33.340 --> 25:38.780]  There's not enough time in the day so the role that you have played has been you know monumental.
[25:38.780 --> 25:44.700]  It might go I think you're pretty darn well recognized and received but a lot of that stuff
[25:44.700 --> 25:51.580]  goes unseen. The better you do your job the less people notice. Yeah yeah. Well and Frenchy was
[25:51.580 --> 25:58.860]  such a phenomenal force you know like when he would attend these cannabis conferences or you
[25:58.860 --> 26:07.180]  know the cups and bring the hookah. He created so much community and he had such an ability to focus
[26:07.180 --> 26:14.940]  in on the person in front of him and just give them his undivided attention and that that was a
[26:14.940 --> 26:22.540]  very special kind of attribute to his personality and I think you know it really touched a lot of
[26:22.540 --> 26:30.460]  people in a healing way in a way that was inspirational to them. You know he worked
[26:30.460 --> 26:37.980]  with a lot of young people in his workshops and encouraged people to you know pursue their own
[26:37.980 --> 26:46.300]  love of the plant and of hash making. So yeah I'm really happy to be able to continue his work.
[26:46.860 --> 26:52.220]  Oh that's awesome and we all appreciate that. And you mentioned the movie earlier now you've
[26:52.220 --> 26:58.540]  kind of been on a whirlwind tour but there's still one stop lift in the premieres. Is that right?
[26:58.540 --> 27:04.780]  Next Friday we're going to be going to Chicago and Chicago's a little special in that we couldn't find
[27:04.780 --> 27:10.700]  a traditional theater in Chicago for whatever reason. I called like over 30 places and there
[27:10.700 --> 27:16.620]  just wasn't one that was a good fit. So we're ending up screening it at the Chi-Town Drive-In
[27:16.620 --> 27:23.100]  and this came together. They have an indoor soccer field in Chicago because of course with the
[27:23.100 --> 27:30.540]  winter you can't play soccer year-round there and during the pandemic they weren't allowed to use
[27:30.540 --> 27:36.300]  the indoor soccer field for soccer but they had this large parking lot that was adjacent to their
[27:36.300 --> 27:44.540]  facility. So they turned it into a drive-in a traditional drive-in and the soccer field has a
[27:44.540 --> 27:50.780]  taqueria attached to it. So they've extended that association of the taqueria to the drive-in.
[27:50.780 --> 27:56.780]  So now you can order tacos and milkshakes and whatnot as you arrive at the theater and it will
[27:56.780 --> 28:02.620]  be delivered to your car while you're watching the movie. So a very kind of ultra traditional
[28:02.620 --> 28:08.060]  American experience. It should be lovely. I think you know the weather is still going to be pretty
[28:08.060 --> 28:16.460]  nice in the Chicago area. We get sunset I think a little after six. So yeah I'm really looking
[28:16.460 --> 28:21.500]  forward to sharing the film with everybody in this very traditional American format.
[28:22.060 --> 28:27.580]  That would be so fun. You know drive-ins are a treat and I'm looking at you chat when I say this
[28:28.140 --> 28:34.700]  a drive-through where the tacos are delivered to your car. Can it get any freaking better than that?
[28:34.700 --> 28:42.620]  You know like I sign me up if I was in Chicago I would definitely be there. I know a lot of people
[28:42.620 --> 28:47.900]  here in chat are in Chicago as well. You guys should definitely check this out if there's the
[28:47.900 --> 28:52.140]  chance. Now I know a lot of the events that you did have sold out. Are there still tickets
[28:52.140 --> 28:59.420]  available for the the Chi-Town drive-in? Yes there are and the ticket price is a per car price. So
[29:00.620 --> 29:05.660]  you can put as many people in your car as you like. My understanding is you're also allowed
[29:05.660 --> 29:12.380]  to bring your lawn chairs if you want to sit in front of your car. You just need some radio that
[29:12.380 --> 29:17.980]  you can tune to the FM frequency where the audio for the movie will be played.
[29:19.900 --> 29:27.260]  So yeah I think it's going to be really lovely. And of course because you're in the privacy of
[29:27.260 --> 29:34.860]  your car and Illinois does have adult use you can smoke while viewing the film. And I
[29:35.420 --> 29:41.900]  made sure with the facility that there wouldn't be any issues on that level and there will not be.
[29:41.900 --> 29:49.580]  Your car is considered your private space so up to you. Very very good thinking there. And this was
[29:49.580 --> 29:57.820]  the the 23rd. I'm looking at it here Friday. So next Friday 23rd 6 15 p.m. is when it starts. So
[29:57.820 --> 30:04.540]  people should probably pull in a bit earlier than that. Shoot this would be a great opportunity for
[30:04.540 --> 30:10.540]  tailgating. And you know sometimes the stoner brain goes to how many people can I fit in my car.
[30:11.500 --> 30:18.460]  I've thought about trunks for sure. Yeah. Yeah I'm just picturing the old you know the drive-ins
[30:18.460 --> 30:22.380]  with the station wagon where you can almost fit a hot tub in the back of it and everybody's
[30:22.940 --> 30:29.500]  sitting out there eating and drinking and enjoying themselves. Yeah. So that'll be fun. Again if you
[30:29.500 --> 30:34.700]  guys are in the Chicago area and again you can find more information too down in the show notes
[30:34.780 --> 30:40.780]  the Frenchie Cannoli dot com website is going to have details about the movie and also this
[30:40.780 --> 30:49.020]  last chance to go and catch a screening. So everybody check that out. So that was that's
[30:49.020 --> 30:57.500]  traveling to Chicago but traveling you have been a world traveler for many many years. That's true
[30:57.500 --> 31:07.420]  for your life. Why America. Why did you guys wind up here or decide. I have the American passport
[31:07.980 --> 31:15.900]  so that made it kind of easy. And we went to France after we were in Asia for about 20 years
[31:17.020 --> 31:22.380]  when our daughter got to the age that you know we needed to start thinking about school and whatnot.
[31:23.180 --> 31:28.220]  We didn't like it at all. It was not friendly entrepreneur early. It was not friendly from
[31:28.220 --> 31:36.380]  a cannabis perspective. So we came to California which was just going into medical. It was very
[31:36.380 --> 31:43.500]  you know friendly. And yeah the rest is history. Frenchie went up north found the cannabis community
[31:43.500 --> 31:51.580]  up there and had it you know just had a lovely time here. And Northern California you know has
[31:51.580 --> 31:56.940]  always kind of been like the the breadbasket for cannabis in the States as far as you know
[31:56.940 --> 32:04.140]  production as far as maybe finding new strains. But one thing that goes on there is outdoor growing
[32:04.140 --> 32:09.580]  lots of outdoor grows. And that's something you know that I've heard Frenchie and yourself speak
[32:09.580 --> 32:16.860]  about the importance of outdoor cannabis versus maybe some of the indoor stuff. Because we have
[32:16.860 --> 32:26.140]  this concept in French called terroir. And terroir means that a specific location in combination with
[32:26.140 --> 32:33.980]  its atmosphere it's you know the mineral content of its soil the type of weather that you're
[32:33.980 --> 32:40.540]  getting the type of wet water sources that you have and also the love and devotion of the farmer
[32:41.100 --> 32:48.220]  will create a product that is recognizable of reflecting the taste of that place is one way
[32:48.220 --> 32:54.700]  that it's been used to describe. So when you think of terroir in France we have different
[32:54.700 --> 33:01.740]  wine regions that are known for their terroir for certain cultivars like Bordeaux and Champagne.
[33:01.740 --> 33:09.740]  Or you have areas that are known for different cheeses. And it's so strong in Europe that
[33:09.740 --> 33:16.140]  the local governments have created a legal structure called Appellation Controle. And it
[33:16.140 --> 33:24.700]  means basically controlled registration of name of the place. So this protects the farmers who grow
[33:24.700 --> 33:32.220]  that specific thing in that area from competition that we try to use that name for a product that
[33:32.220 --> 33:36.860]  wasn't grown in that area. So there's an understanding that there's something very
[33:36.940 --> 33:44.620]  special about especially Humboldt and Mendocino in terms of their water source the type of you know
[33:46.460 --> 33:52.380]  vegetation that's growing there the redwood trees the fog that comes off of the ocean.
[33:52.380 --> 33:58.540]  When you smoke Humboldt cannabis there's almost like a back flavor that you would say is the taste
[33:58.620 --> 34:07.420]  of Humboldt. The smell of Humboldt. And this is you know that so strong that that group of farmers
[34:07.420 --> 34:13.500]  that we worked with on the lost coast they're actually going to do scientific studies to define
[34:13.500 --> 34:19.580]  what this is. And part of the proceeds from the film 20 percent of the proceeds from the film
[34:19.580 --> 34:25.340]  were donating to a group in northern California called the Origins Council. And they work with
[34:25.340 --> 34:33.740]  over 900 legacy farms and businesses to help promote these small artisanal farmers in Sacramento
[34:33.740 --> 34:41.740]  to get better conditions for cannabis for these you know smaller farms. And within that Origins
[34:41.740 --> 34:49.180]  Council there they have a like umbrella group for this Lost Coast Farmers Guild and are supporting
[34:49.180 --> 34:55.660]  these scientific efforts. So by attending the film you are in fact helping us to fund the
[34:55.660 --> 35:02.300]  scientific efforts to define cannabis terroir. So we're pretty excited about that actually.
[35:03.260 --> 35:10.060]  That is exciting. And you know a lot of a lot of cannabis knowledge particularly on the medicinal
[35:10.060 --> 35:16.060]  side it all starts out as anecdotal anecdotal evidence. You know people say people say and
[35:16.060 --> 35:22.140]  then we were finding out later that there really is something to it. And I hope that this will be
[35:23.420 --> 35:28.140]  a boost to the small farmers in those areas you know in the Emerald Triangle. I
[35:28.140 --> 35:33.740]  personally am a small craft cannabis person. I'm not a fan of the corporations.
[35:34.620 --> 35:39.580]  And they are the ones who seem to be succeeding particularly in California.
[35:39.580 --> 35:45.100]  I don't think they're succeeding in California. Nobody wants to buy their mids and the legacy market is thriving.
[35:45.100 --> 35:49.500]  So I don't think that success or if you look at Canada you know I was just in Canada for the
[35:49.500 --> 35:58.940]  screening there. The Canadian government recently destroyed a huge quantity of this material that
[35:58.940 --> 36:03.580]  they haven't been able to sell. That's just been sitting around for the last couple years. So they
[36:03.580 --> 36:07.980]  were like you know what this old harvest stuff we're never going to be able to sell it. So
[36:08.700 --> 36:13.740]  I think it was you know and I'm probably exaggerating but like 300,000 pounds or
[36:13.740 --> 36:19.500]  something. It was in the news just when I was up there. I mean it's an astronomical amount that just
[36:19.500 --> 36:27.660]  goes to show how unsuccessful legalization has been in Canada and similarly in California.
[36:29.020 --> 36:37.820]  So I think that actually we need there's a push now also I believe there's a new legislation that's
[36:37.820 --> 36:43.980]  just been proposed to allow these artisanal farmers to sell direct to consumers which is
[36:43.980 --> 36:50.540]  exactly what we had back under medical and it worked fine for 20 years. It allowed us to pay
[36:50.540 --> 36:56.620]  the farmers a living more than a living wage. It allowed us to provide medicine to the patients at
[36:56.620 --> 37:03.020]  a very accessible price so that they could afford to have you know continual access for their health
[37:03.020 --> 37:10.380]  needs and it allowed us to to earn an honorable you know amount to to keep our own roof over our
[37:10.380 --> 37:17.340]  heads and be you know good taxpaying members of society. Which is nobody is asked to become
[37:17.340 --> 37:23.900]  millionaires. Everybody is asked to be able to continue their craft in an honorable way
[37:24.460 --> 37:32.540]  under conditions that don't make them almost victims of their work. You know right now when
[37:32.540 --> 37:38.460]  we look in northern California with these small farmers people are using their life savings to
[37:38.460 --> 37:44.140]  finish this harvest because the price of cannabis has been so low that they're not covering their
[37:44.140 --> 37:52.700]  actual expenses to produce it and that's criminal. That's not how you create thriving
[37:53.260 --> 38:00.860]  rural communities you know and let's be clear you know under legacy the communities in Humboldt and
[38:00.860 --> 38:08.540]  Mendocino were very stable. You know there wasn't there weren't people that were risking to lose
[38:08.540 --> 38:17.100]  their farms or were retirement age and had now going back to doing you know low paying jobs just
[38:17.100 --> 38:24.220]  to have enough money to to eat. So sometimes people you know they'll cut off their nose to
[38:24.220 --> 38:30.380]  despite their face just again you know that economy really thrived and hummed there you know
[38:30.380 --> 38:36.300]  it supported the grocery store, the hair salon, the you know the corner mom and pop shop. But when
[38:36.300 --> 38:45.660]  you take that finance financial input away well yeah there are going to be trickle-down repercussions
[38:45.660 --> 38:51.660]  of that and that's something that I don't think well I don't know if lawmakers care or they
[38:51.660 --> 38:56.620]  intended that but I mean you just look at other industries like the auto industry. I used to live
[38:56.620 --> 39:04.540]  in Michigan in the 80s, Detroit that was a thriving bustling city when it was the automotive capital.
[39:04.540 --> 39:09.740]  I just don't think they understood what they had in terms of Frenchy used to always say that
[39:10.380 --> 39:17.260]  the small organic you know farmer regenerative farmers of northern California who had been doing
[39:17.260 --> 39:23.180]  this for multiple generations these were the golden geese of the cannabis industry for California
[39:23.180 --> 39:28.540]  and that they need to be protected and nurtured and that there needed to be a rule out that didn't
[39:28.540 --> 39:35.980]  flood the market with inferior product to allow them time to to stabilize and that what they were
[39:35.980 --> 39:40.780]  doing should have been you know highlighted the government should the government should be paying
[39:40.780 --> 39:47.420]  for those studies on cannabis terroir. You know the same way that they've done with wine and how
[39:47.420 --> 39:56.300]  they protected wine in the Napa you know area. Yeah so it's a tragedy and Frenchy told Gavin
[39:56.300 --> 40:03.500]  Newsom this he came once to you know before uh really uh legalization was implemented he did a
[40:04.140 --> 40:09.660]  little uh meet and greet I think it was at Redaway or Metal at the Metal where they used to do the
[40:09.660 --> 40:13.820]  the Emerald Cup back in the day. Okay. And he warned them he said you know you guys have a
[40:13.820 --> 40:20.300]  blueprint we have a blueprint in Bordeaux that shows you how to turn a legacy market into a
[40:20.300 --> 40:25.740]  thriving legal market. You have everything that you need you have the recognition you have the
[40:25.740 --> 40:31.580]  quality you have the farmers with the know-how you have the public that loves this product that's
[40:31.580 --> 40:39.100]  been consuming it all over the U.S. for generations. You know you should really be talking to these
[40:39.100 --> 40:45.900]  farmers and figuring out how to protect this and elevate it and nurture it and you know he listened
[40:45.900 --> 40:51.580]  to big money that had never probably had never smoked cannabis in their life and certainly knew
[40:51.580 --> 40:59.660]  nothing about growing it and so the result is we have an flooded market of inferior quality
[40:59.660 --> 41:06.460]  cannabis and we've lost our recognition for being the best producers in the world in less than five
[41:06.460 --> 41:14.620]  years. Yeah well if you go over to Europe everything with the word Cali on it is three times the price.
[41:14.780 --> 41:19.820]  Miguel said that the other day at the presentation in San Francisco he said
[41:20.460 --> 41:25.660]  well it may have been you know damaged it's not destroyed because as you just said
[41:25.660 --> 41:31.180]  just about anywhere you go when you ask what's your top shelf it's something that they've imported
[41:31.180 --> 41:37.660]  from NorCal. Yeah yep and you're right too the stakeholders were all wrong there weren't enough
[41:37.660 --> 41:43.420]  people with vested interests in the legacy market. I'm in Washington and it was just for lack of
[41:43.420 --> 41:49.580]  a better term a shit show. Nobody we legalized first the same time as Colorado. Nobody looks at
[41:49.580 --> 41:55.740]  Washington as an example of how to start your state off legally and it was much of the same thing.
[41:56.300 --> 42:01.980]  I was working in the medicinal side at that point. I had a group it was called Seniors MMJ Network
[42:01.980 --> 42:09.020]  because I believe in this plant as a medicine and I also feel that some of the older generations
[42:09.020 --> 42:15.020]  ones who grew up with reefer madness could actually potentially benefit the most from
[42:15.580 --> 42:21.420]  what this plant has to offer. So just trying to break that stigma down and then you know going
[42:21.420 --> 42:26.060]  that route working towards that route here comes legalization. I was involved with some of the
[42:26.060 --> 42:32.140]  planning and the rule writing and I was just completely disregarded by someone with a slick suit.
[42:32.700 --> 42:41.500]  Yeah so it's a little a little unfortunate to see but hey that's all right. Oh I forgot who said
[42:41.500 --> 42:47.260]  this but it's like the long arc of history always ends up on the righteous and the good. So hopefully
[42:47.260 --> 42:54.060]  that's where we will be once this all shakes down and they're doing the Amazon model of okay I can
[42:54.060 --> 42:59.340]  lose money for three years and still be in business so I'm going to do that while you go under.
[42:59.900 --> 43:05.740]  Hopefully we get through that phase and then craft cannabis will rise from those ashes because like
[43:05.740 --> 43:10.700]  you said nobody wants to smoke mids and you were absolutely correct. I remember reading that
[43:10.700 --> 43:17.980]  article about Canada and I pulled this up but they recently destroyed 425 million grams. Yeah see
[43:17.980 --> 43:25.820]  that's what it was it was a pretty significant amount and you know that's why Frenchie had his
[43:26.540 --> 43:34.780]  workshop made into professional four-part video series because honestly at this point in kind of
[43:34.780 --> 43:40.780]  cannabis legalization everybody should be growing their own and making their own product for
[43:40.780 --> 43:46.860]  themselves and their family. I mean for a couple of reasons quality obviously but also to control
[43:46.860 --> 43:54.460]  the input and control the cleanliness and it just when you look at the process you know it's not
[43:54.460 --> 44:02.380]  that expensive to get yourself a little mini washer and a set of bags these days and I really
[44:02.380 --> 44:08.220]  see us moving potentially to a trend where you know in some of our communities how you have
[44:08.220 --> 44:13.580]  small bakeries that are providing the bread or you you know you have the local dairy or whatnot
[44:14.540 --> 44:20.940]  well we're going to have the local hash maker at some point and maybe that means that some people
[44:21.020 --> 44:27.340]  are doing this for you know extended family groups so the same way that you might make jam
[44:27.340 --> 44:33.020]  from your strawberries or put up your tomatoes you should learn to make your own your own hash.
[44:34.380 --> 44:39.100]  I would love to have like a CSA box that people can sign up for this which is something a lot of
[44:39.100 --> 44:44.060]  farms do is you you buy like you pay for six months worth of food and that you know every
[44:44.060 --> 44:48.380]  week or every month whatever they have a box you can pick up at the farm I'd love to you know if
[44:48.380 --> 44:53.660]  they pass this law that they're proposing in California that wouldn't be such a incredible
[44:53.660 --> 44:59.100]  thing you know they're talking about direct to consumer from the you know from the farms to the
[44:59.100 --> 45:06.060]  consumers so feasibly we could have a lot of these smaller farms having their each one of them having
[45:06.060 --> 45:12.380]  their own dedicated hash maker that's processing the plants that they're growing and I think this
[45:12.380 --> 45:19.660]  becomes an extension of that appellation process you know that they'll have an appellation for
[45:19.660 --> 45:25.660]  Humboldt where it could be labeled with the name of the farm you know where the plants were grown
[45:26.220 --> 45:33.340]  and you know controlled so that you would know that this came from a verified facility that was
[45:33.980 --> 45:42.300]  practicing sustainable agriculture using organic methodologies so you could be assured that you
[45:42.300 --> 45:49.500]  were getting really clean quality product yeah and it may sound a little silly on the surface but
[45:49.500 --> 45:55.260]  you're talking to her war at the beginning but you know I could see people being like well I only like
[45:55.820 --> 46:02.540]  flour or hash that was produced on you know the 47th parallel you know different regions of the
[46:02.540 --> 46:10.300]  globe because weather is similar but this soil is different and that you know microbes bacteria
[46:10.300 --> 46:17.820]  those are I think the the the hidden gold in the ground that really differentiates
[46:18.380 --> 46:25.980]  your emerald triangle versus your middle of Utah cannabis and you had mentioned there too
[46:26.940 --> 46:31.820]  you know earlier that this is a never-ending process we're never gonna know it all learn it
[46:31.820 --> 46:37.580]  all and if you think you have you should keep going but as far as someone like me let's just
[46:37.580 --> 46:44.380]  say you know home grower I harvested a few plants outside what is the best way to maybe get started
[46:44.380 --> 46:51.340]  on this journey of trying to make some hash or learn or improve our game you said bubble bags
[46:51.340 --> 46:59.180]  and maybe a washer so we use the press club bags because um they're reasonably priced it's not
[46:59.180 --> 47:06.540]  gonna break the bank for the the new person you know learning this and then you can get a mini
[47:06.540 --> 47:16.860]  washer on ebay or amazon for about 70 and with those two things you can you could make a lot of
[47:16.860 --> 47:24.380]  hash each day actually because that little mini washer can hold about 350 grams of dried material
[47:24.380 --> 47:30.860]  and if you think of a you know like generally the yields about 10 so if you were to do three loads
[47:30.860 --> 47:36.620]  over the course of the day which is not impossible that's 90 grams you know um a lot
[47:38.300 --> 47:44.140]  yeah and then I would say you know the simplest thing is watch that first Frenchie video it's the
[47:44.140 --> 47:50.620]  washing video it's about an hour and all the basics are covered in that video and you can find
[47:50.620 --> 48:01.180]  that at the www.frenchicanoli.com forward slash diy do it yourself and it's the first video in the
[48:01.180 --> 48:07.660]  series it's just called the washing video and Frenchie takes you through step by step why he
[48:07.660 --> 48:16.060]  does each thing and he shows you both with a mini washer and with a commercial washer how to wash
[48:16.060 --> 48:22.540]  the trichome heads from the plants into the sieving bags how you clean the material more
[48:22.540 --> 48:30.860]  while they are in the sieving bags and um yeah so this is the whole series on top of it we have it
[48:30.860 --> 48:38.140]  in with subtitles in six languages so you can choose your preferred language english portuguese
[48:38.140 --> 48:46.780]  spanish french italian or german at this point and um yeah that is amazing and an excellent
[48:46.780 --> 48:54.300]  resource for anybody looking to understand this uh even more uh and i'm glad you brought up the
[48:54.300 --> 48:59.580]  website too because there are oh my gosh there are so many things uh that we could cover and
[48:59.580 --> 49:06.220]  i know we're actually time is flying today um but i encourage everybody to go to the website and
[49:06.220 --> 49:13.180]  check things out you know we have different we got your event calendar here um writings by Frenchy
[49:13.180 --> 49:20.220]  you know this brings us to all of these this is a real kind of treasure trove for Weed World for
[49:20.220 --> 49:27.020]  five years and they publish i think six times a year so there's quite a wealth of content here
[49:27.020 --> 49:33.180]  where he explores different topics the last series that he wrote is a six-part series
[49:33.820 --> 49:41.500]  on the hash making process where he put into text format all of his thinking well to a lot of his
[49:41.500 --> 49:47.420]  thinking on hash making so that's kind of a companion to the videos if you will reading
[49:47.420 --> 49:57.420]  those six articles um i think another you know fun thing that we are doing since Frenchy's passing
[49:57.420 --> 50:03.820]  in the Lost Art group is something called the Orange Turbo Group Grow so somebody asked me what
[50:03.820 --> 50:12.380]  Frenchy's favorite cultivar was and as part of the hash porn you know um during the pandemic
[50:12.380 --> 50:20.460]  Frenchy really was missing the conferences and the attending you know the competitions and whatnot
[50:20.460 --> 50:26.460]  basically to see people and smoke together so he created something called the hash porn contest and
[50:26.460 --> 50:33.340]  this allowed people who were kind of new to the industry to show off what they were were making
[50:34.860 --> 50:43.900]  and we've done this four or five times now where we um we use our instagram account and we share
[50:44.780 --> 50:50.780]  what people submit and then based on the number of likes that people get there's winners in
[50:50.780 --> 50:57.660]  categories so we have loose resin category traditional hashish rosin and then we also have
[50:57.660 --> 51:03.020]  a sculpture category because who knew but some people love to make sculpture out of traditional
[51:03.020 --> 51:11.500]  hashish and so this has been a lot of fun so we're going to be doing this again next year for 420
[51:11.500 --> 51:16.620]  but we're going to have a special category next year for orange turbo because we've been doing
[51:16.620 --> 51:27.820]  a group grow in the lost art group using this same cultivar with seeds from mt um mtg mtc mtg
[51:27.820 --> 51:36.140]  mtg seeds um and we now have about 300 people worldwide that are growing the orange turbo
[51:36.140 --> 51:43.020]  and everybody is going to harvest that and make hash from it and then we will be having a standalone
[51:43.020 --> 51:49.820]  orange turbo category next year to see how different people grow different i mean it's
[51:49.820 --> 51:54.460]  not perfect because we're using seeds and we're not using clones but it'll be interesting to see
[51:54.460 --> 52:01.980]  how the plants respond to the various terroir the talent of the hash maker in terms of you know how
[52:01.980 --> 52:09.580]  they they all are using this cultivar and um just to see just to see what people make um
[52:09.980 --> 52:14.860]  yeah i don't know if you saw my jaw drop when i was looking at that page i'm sure there's plenty
[52:14.860 --> 52:20.460]  of people out there right there's some beautiful stuff there's it was such a lovely opportunity
[52:20.460 --> 52:28.220]  for frenchie to showcase the work of a lot of people working you know kind of in the privacy
[52:28.220 --> 52:33.580]  of their own garage or their own little hash making setup that they had at their house
[52:33.660 --> 52:38.780]  had at their house and some people working commercially um some of those people you know
[52:38.780 --> 52:44.140]  do are part of commercial entities so it's a lovely thing to be able to showcase the work
[52:44.140 --> 52:50.460]  of these people who are all over north america some are in europe you know various places around
[52:50.460 --> 52:58.780]  the world and to um kind of almost bring the community together that way to uh you know to
[52:58.780 --> 53:05.180]  just a moment of appreciation it's all about it's not about critiquing the person's work it's just
[53:05.180 --> 53:11.580]  it's all about appreciation through the likes i love that because you know even even if you come
[53:12.380 --> 53:15.900]  you know you might be new you might not understand all of the nuances so you might
[53:15.900 --> 53:21.980]  come with something that isn't 100 the best stuff but i also too believe that it's the effort and
[53:21.980 --> 53:28.140]  the wanting to continue to learn so that that positive support system there is great because
[53:28.140 --> 53:35.340]  that's encouraging um you don't get you don't get to the table without any effort you have to put
[53:35.340 --> 53:40.140]  in a little bit of effort just to grow this plant let alone process it in this special way so
[53:41.020 --> 53:47.660]  always learning but it's nice that it's kind of focused more on that encouragement uh just get
[53:47.660 --> 53:52.700]  people to do it that's that's another thing well and that's also what the lost art group is about
[53:52.700 --> 53:59.260]  you know people can post their questions or they can post the results and say you know like either
[53:59.260 --> 54:04.620]  i think this is really good what do you think or i think this could use improvement what are your
[54:04.620 --> 54:10.780]  suggestions on you know how to improve it yeah and being open to it and having the you know the
[54:10.780 --> 54:17.740]  knowledgeable people that can get the message across in a nice enough way to to not offend
[54:17.740 --> 54:24.620]  somebody but at the same time people can't have thin skin it's all an effort to to improve and
[54:24.620 --> 54:30.940]  you know the better information that you know you give me i'm able to learn and then i can pass on
[54:30.940 --> 54:35.180]  and again it's just that beautiful thing of continuing kind of like an oral tradition
[54:35.180 --> 54:42.860]  almost you you know you have worked to capture a lot of this in a you know historical format that
[54:42.860 --> 54:49.820]  can survive time which is very important but also that oral tradition which i know frenchy learned a
[54:49.820 --> 54:56.860]  lot through his travels directly from the source who have had it passed down generation to generation
[54:56.860 --> 55:04.300]  to generation one of the nice things on the facebook group um it feels weird to say something's
[55:04.300 --> 55:14.700]  nice about that one of the somewhat nice things is um there's a section in the group like on the
[55:14.700 --> 55:21.260]  um menu board there that's called the guides and the guides are basically just a way to create a
[55:21.260 --> 55:27.500]  library you can have folders with a title on them so as we've been i think we've been doing this
[55:27.500 --> 55:33.180]  group now for about five years as we go through and there are some posts on very interesting
[55:33.180 --> 55:39.820]  topics i dump them into these guides so there's a whole library of information that's available in
[55:39.820 --> 55:48.380]  the lost art group there's a section on um you know 101 for washing there's a lot of historical
[55:48.380 --> 55:56.780]  references because frenchy was very very interested in historical um writings on cannabis so some of
[55:56.780 --> 56:03.500]  it goes way back you know so we've we've noted books that you can find from the 1400s where
[56:03.500 --> 56:09.980]  cannabis was mentioned some of the earliest drawings of cannabis um it's really quite lovely
[56:09.980 --> 56:16.940]  and then the other thing because of water issues in a variety of places on the planet we really
[56:16.940 --> 56:24.460]  need to start looking at dry sieving and improved methodology in that area and a practice that's
[56:24.460 --> 56:32.140]  offering a lot of optimism is what's called static tech and we have a few users in the group that are
[56:32.140 --> 56:37.660]  experts in that and so they've provided some content so we have folders on static tech for
[56:37.660 --> 56:44.460]  people who want to explore that um so i know a lot of people it's an open group and a lot of people
[56:44.460 --> 56:50.700]  don't um don't participate because they don't want information on their their feed where maybe their
[56:50.700 --> 56:57.660]  mom could see it or whatever but you're welcome to lurk and to use the guides and to uh you know
[56:57.660 --> 57:03.980]  i think there are enough people that are out there that uh don't have those constraints that can ask
[57:03.980 --> 57:11.020]  questions that you can read the exchange and benefit from from that so it's only hash making
[57:11.020 --> 57:17.580]  content we don't cover growing uh we don't cover anything else we have an approval process for the
[57:17.580 --> 57:22.860]  posts because we were getting too much garbage that had nothing to do with anything and so we
[57:22.860 --> 57:29.980]  run a pretty tight ship so that people don't are not inundated by garbage good and that's appreciated
[57:29.980 --> 57:37.340]  uh because there is so much out there these days yeah it's nice to have it filtered so i do
[57:37.340 --> 57:43.180]  appreciate that you mentioned too uh you know some of the traditional countries and another tab on the
[57:43.180 --> 57:49.180]  website again everybody uh in chat or listening on the replay the the website link frenchie canole
[57:49.180 --> 57:52.780]  dot com is down in the show notes this is where you're going to find all the tabs that we're
[57:52.780 --> 57:57.820]  talking about here but another uh one of those you know i mentioned uh articles on producing
[57:57.820 --> 58:03.020]  countries and and again going back to that tradition and where it was passed down from
[58:03.580 --> 58:10.460]  um so there's plenty of links there which are gray i mean 1894 to 1895 report on the indian hemp
[58:10.460 --> 58:16.780]  drugs commission this is all fascinating that's a very interesting um eight volume study that was
[58:16.780 --> 58:24.460]  done by the english when they were colonizing india they wanted to determine if had uh cannabis
[58:24.460 --> 58:29.980]  consumption caused insanity and if they if it didn't they wanted to tax it so they did this very
[58:29.980 --> 58:38.540]  um long in-depth study um it's very interesting in that they captured recipes for bong and other
[58:38.540 --> 58:47.100]  local traditional um concoctions uh it's a it's a very interesting thing to kind of just skim through
[58:47.100 --> 58:54.380]  and see some of the historical content and and here's you know uh dr ethan russo uh is a name
[58:54.380 --> 58:59.340]  that a lot of us will know and follow just because of his work with terpenes and the endocannabinoid
[58:59.340 --> 59:05.340]  system uh here's an article he wrote cannabis in india ancient lore and modern medicine uh taming
[59:05.340 --> 59:11.180]  thc up here actually that's one of my favorite papers that came out in 2011 that started me on a
[59:11.180 --> 59:16.940]  road uh of just wanting to know more but all of these here all of these links again they're they're
[59:16.940 --> 59:23.580]  up in the science behind link here and and the one that is next to that the trichome research
[59:23.580 --> 59:31.020]  initiative so frenchie was very interested in aging hashish because he had experienced aged
[59:31.020 --> 59:37.980]  charas you know he rented fields in northern in northern india in the himachal pradesh area which
[59:37.980 --> 59:44.620]  is the the himalayas for eight season he rented from this one family and one of the things that
[59:44.620 --> 59:50.700]  they would do they would take a portion of what they had made during the the harvest and they
[59:50.700 --> 59:55.260]  would hide it so that it would be available to them to him when he came back the next year because at
[59:55.260 --> 01:00:00.140]  the beginning of the season normally you've smoked everything you have and you want to have something
[01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:05.980]  available to you so it was a small handful of italian and french people that were up there that
[01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:12.220]  were doing this kind of in the same time frame in the general overall area where frenchie was at
[01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:18.060]  so they used to get together and they would smoke some of this head stash and over the time you know
[01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:23.500]  when he was there seven eight years he found himself smoking from some of these italians who
[01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:29.820]  had been there longer 10 and 12 year old charas and really appreciating you know kind of the
[01:00:29.820 --> 01:00:35.980]  flavor of this aged material that had been you know appropriately stored so one of the things he
[01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:41.820]  always wanted to do was to study what happens when you age material because here in the west you have
[01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:47.820]  so many people who keep it in the refrigerator and say no it's impossible it needs to be consumed
[01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:54.620]  very rapidly we have this kind of illusion by the dispensaries that if the material if the hash is a
[01:00:54.620 --> 01:01:00.860]  year old they have to throw it away and you have to pay them for it and other so we did this six
[01:01:00.860 --> 01:01:08.860]  months study with high north labs in canada and you can see in the study we we analyzed the flower
[01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:16.620]  the loose resin and the pressed hash from the same material and the degradation that occurs is very
[01:01:16.620 --> 01:01:26.140]  minimal you don't see a huge transformation into cbn which is the sulfuric uh you know
[01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:33.100]  cannabinoid that tends to make people sleepy that everybody is concerned concerned about and you do
[01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:39.180]  see rare monotropines emerging that are not present in the plant in the flower material that's
[01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:45.820]  analyzed so that just goes to you know kind of give inspiration to the hash maker that through
[01:01:45.820 --> 01:01:51.500]  your efforts in both how you make the material and how you treat it afterwards when you store it
[01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:59.820]  potentially there's a market that will emerge in the future around h hash each um so yeah so we're
[01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:07.340]  going to try and continue those studies so that we understand more clearly what's the optimum way to
[01:02:07.340 --> 01:02:15.660]  store it and what potentially how you can play with those temperatures to achieve you know some
[01:02:15.660 --> 01:02:23.900]  signature style in your hash making um potentially i'm very interested in that and since i originally
[01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:28.940]  had heard of this and and the topic you know i think i heard an interview with him where he's
[01:02:28.940 --> 01:02:34.700]  talking about i smoke 10 year old hash i'm like what would that even be like i've never kept it
[01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:42.220]  that long but now i do i set aside from each uh you know each run that i do uh i like to do the
[01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:49.340]  the water extraction and i just do my best to make a temple ball get it sealed up and you know
[01:02:49.340 --> 01:02:55.820]  sitting in the drawer so one day i will bust those out but again with my recent travels to amsterdam
[01:02:55.820 --> 01:03:02.220]  i miss that traditional pressed hash and so it doesn't stick around as long as uh maybe it should
[01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:11.740]  so i understand that and you know real quick to going back to the the the website and i i really
[01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:16.140]  appreciate your time and i know we're kind of running a little bit over here i just want to
[01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:24.700]  touch on a couple real quick things to the scoring for quality uh i think really is a great example
[01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:30.700]  of setting the bar for how to judge uh was this something that you had kind of helped organized
[01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:39.660]  or at least format uh into uh criteria yeah so frenchie told me how he wanted this set up and
[01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:46.380]  i put this together for him then further to this frenchie is one of the founding council members of
[01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:56.060]  the gangier program that is creating um cannabis sommeliers and they all he also was part of the
[01:03:56.060 --> 01:04:04.220]  group that developed their sap evaluation tool so it very much kind of builds on what he had started
[01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:13.740]  here to formalize this process of um cannabis evaluation used both for flower and for for hashish
[01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:21.180]  because he attended many cups where there wasn't a very standardized way of evaluating the material
[01:04:21.180 --> 01:04:28.940]  and so you had some judges approach it one way and others another and in order to have a very
[01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:36.300]  impartial outcome to judging we need some structure we need some uh criteria around how
[01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:41.340]  we're looking at the material that's being evaluated and i think more importantly one of
[01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:46.940]  the things that he also wanted to see which is kind of why we ended up doing the orange turbo
[01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:52.780]  group grow he always used to say you know a lot of these competitions it's a little bit like a fruit
[01:04:52.780 --> 01:04:58.780]  salad because you would see in some cases back in the day where they would have hashish and rosin
[01:04:58.780 --> 01:05:04.780]  all mixed together under this so-called hash category and the judges would be evaluating
[01:05:04.780 --> 01:05:11.900]  these things and it's kind of like again evaluating apple juice and applesauce why would you do that
[01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:18.700]  yet you know in a normal world you you wouldn't or or also it's because you're looking at different
[01:05:18.700 --> 01:05:26.140]  cultivars what if you have a judge who doesn't like citrus and fruity flavor cultivars and yet
[01:05:26.140 --> 01:05:32.060]  a lot of what he's being asked or she's being asked to evaluate falls into that group you know
[01:05:32.060 --> 01:05:38.380]  that they're going to have a bias against that to start with so it just feels like it would be more
[01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:46.460]  interesting and more maybe logical if we had some competitions where the farmers were all asked to
[01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:52.540]  grow from the same starting material the same starting cultivar and then we evaluated that
[01:05:52.540 --> 01:05:59.980]  because then we could start to look at well where does this cultivar grow best and then also how is
[01:05:59.980 --> 01:06:06.700]  the talent of this farmer at nurturing this cultivar into something that then either they
[01:06:06.700 --> 01:06:13.100]  themselves make a process into hashish or like Frenchie had his relationship with the farmers up
[01:06:13.100 --> 01:06:20.380]  north they hand off to a master hashishin who then transforms that into something that's very
[01:06:20.460 --> 01:06:26.460]  reflective of the talent of the farmer and at the same time allows the hash maker to put their
[01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:33.180]  little signature on what they're doing bell frenchie's apprentice likes to say you know as
[01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:38.380]  you're working with the material it will tell you what it wants to be you know sometimes they make
[01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:45.420]  something in tradition into traditional hash but sometimes they make it into rosin or in some cases
[01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:53.020]  they'll leave it you know loose to be used for something else so i think it's really important
[01:06:53.020 --> 01:06:59.100]  for us to maybe have more discussion and reflection when it comes to these competitions
[01:06:59.100 --> 01:07:06.140]  on what it is we're actually evaluating yes i think it also offers a level of transparency
[01:07:06.140 --> 01:07:13.660]  to the process uh to have a unified guideline that each judge is using and and for that part each
[01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:16.860]  different contest is using too that's something i would love to see because that
[01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:24.140]  you know like you said uh some people have biases against some flavor profiles you know some people
[01:07:24.140 --> 01:07:29.980]  don't like orange some people don't like gas i love it all but it exists i have a friend people
[01:07:29.980 --> 01:07:37.420]  who are competing they're putting so much time and effort into creating that entry often there's a
[01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:44.700]  very expensive entry fee or they're being asked to give a significant quantity of their product
[01:07:44.700 --> 01:07:51.500]  and if you're some small artisanal farm that represents a bit of a stretch for you a bit of
[01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:59.260]  an investment and if that material is i mean i've seen you know contests where they give the judges
[01:08:00.300 --> 01:08:06.620]  you know i don't know 20 30 samples and they're like okay you know we need your results by tomorrow
[01:08:06.620 --> 01:08:12.140]  that's just insane um nobody you know that shouldn't be the case you should the samples
[01:08:12.140 --> 01:08:17.980]  should be given out maybe like a month ahead of time if not more when you have a large quantity
[01:08:17.980 --> 01:08:26.140]  so that the people who are evaluating can method dot method what's the word i want to say
[01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:32.860]  they can go through and they can you know smoke them each day maybe in the same kind of fresh in
[01:08:32.860 --> 01:08:37.420]  the morning when you haven't smoked something else and you're only doing one at a time or maybe
[01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:44.220]  two a day so that you have a little space in between and you can really appreciate the experience
[01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:49.740]  and and you know make some notes about that evaluation and narrow your categories down i
[01:08:49.740 --> 01:08:55.100]  know swami and nikki that's how approach how they approach judging the emerald cup that they're very
[01:08:55.820 --> 01:09:01.260]  um they treat all the samples that they're given with a lot of reverence and they take a lot of
[01:09:01.260 --> 01:09:10.380]  time and reflection um to pace themselves in this evaluation so that they can come up with a very
[01:09:11.980 --> 01:09:20.140]  informed and you know well-reflected choice in terms of who they select for the top categories
[01:09:21.100 --> 01:09:26.860]  and that's really respect to the craft you know to the farmers and i had the chance to speak with
[01:09:26.860 --> 01:09:32.620]  them uh late last year uh and originally i contacted them i'm like are you available this
[01:09:32.620 --> 01:09:38.700]  week they're like no we're judging for the next two weeks but after that sure let's do it so yeah
[01:09:38.700 --> 01:09:44.620]  they they have that process and you know again it's just yeah all the effort that people put
[01:09:44.620 --> 01:09:50.700]  into getting it there the costs the expenses uh it's nice to have that approach because there's
[01:09:50.700 --> 01:09:57.500]  no way you can unbiasedly sample 24 things in a day that's just not not not possible
[01:09:58.780 --> 01:10:06.220]  so i like to see that um you know everybody um listening here i'm not going to be able to get
[01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:10.780]  through all of the tabs on the website but i definitely do want you to check that out again
[01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:16.620]  it's frenchie canoli.com uh the tabs that i haven't hit on here is podcasts got a bunch of
[01:10:16.620 --> 01:10:23.740]  information there interviews uh the merch and then we i kind of want to hit this one more time
[01:10:23.740 --> 01:10:30.300]  though but the the Frenchie Dreams of Hashish because we do this upcoming Friday in Chicago
[01:10:30.300 --> 01:10:37.900]  we've got one more uh opportunity to go see this as a group which i think is is going to be the
[01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:45.580]  best way to do that uh and again it's it's the uh Chi-Town Drive-In let me pull this up here
[01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:53.180]  one more time but the Chi-Town Drive-In uh in Chicago next Friday September 23rd 6 15 is the
[01:10:53.180 --> 01:11:01.820]  starting time and uh as a person who thinks of it all you have already checked on consumption so
[01:11:01.820 --> 01:11:08.700]  hats off to you for that and and there were still a few a few tickets left some opportunities yeah
[01:11:08.780 --> 01:11:17.500]  okay perfect so now you'll be there in person um are you uh do you introduce the film or
[01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:23.900]  are you just kind of there to uh meet and greet with people so you know normally in the auditorium
[01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:29.260]  of course i can we do both a meet you know i introduce the film and then after the film we
[01:11:29.260 --> 01:11:35.900]  have the producers q a and we talk for about an hour and answer people's questions in this case
[01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:41.340]  obviously that's not going to be feasible because it's outside and everybody's going to be in their
[01:11:41.340 --> 01:11:50.860]  car and i'd be yelling in a parking lot um so um yeah it's going to be the film the next day
[01:11:50.860 --> 01:11:58.140]  bell and i are actually doing a workshop in the Chicago area so i think a few people that are
[01:11:58.140 --> 01:12:03.740]  attending the film will also be coming to the hash making workshop so we'll be able to talk
[01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:12.380]  you know more at length there at the workshop that should be really lovely um yeah good well
[01:12:12.380 --> 01:12:17.900]  that's a you know a nice opportunity and i love that uh you two have that good relationship that
[01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:23.580]  you continue to be on the road together uh you continue to you know spread the message and work
[01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:30.860]  um you know carrying on a tradition i i think that's great and a loss for words there it's just
[01:12:31.740 --> 01:12:36.300]  it's a beautiful thing and you're a beautiful person i appreciate everything that you do and
[01:12:36.300 --> 01:12:41.180]  the time that you give to people too you know it's it's saturday afternoon we're sitting here for
[01:12:41.180 --> 01:12:50.140]  a little over an hour um i do appreciate that one thing before um we go and actually i'll
[01:12:50.140 --> 01:12:56.380]  definitely give you a chance for any last words or thoughts um but i recently was working uh editing
[01:12:56.380 --> 01:13:03.740]  an interview you did a while back um with tad hussie uh for the dope history podcast and i don't
[01:13:03.740 --> 01:13:09.020]  that's going to be coming out very soon i don't want to steal the thunder of anything from that
[01:13:09.820 --> 01:13:17.340]  but there is one story that just i thought was so beautiful that just kind of fits and it related to
[01:13:17.340 --> 01:13:24.220]  your travels in india how you had went there with kind of a group of friends and no i went by myself
[01:13:24.220 --> 01:13:29.260]  oh yourself but you kept bumping into to him i don't know if maybe you want to share a little
[01:13:29.260 --> 01:13:35.500]  bit about that story and maybe the the train and then the trail to to get to this so that was uh
[01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:42.380]  what my daughter calls the meet cute is that how they refer to it um when you meet your long-term
[01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:49.900]  partner i think um it's called the meet cute oh i'm so uh yeah you have to be young to know these
[01:13:49.900 --> 01:13:59.100]  things so i met frenchie june 2nd 1980 when his friend that he was traveling with invited me to a
[01:13:59.100 --> 01:14:03.740]  full moon party the next night on june 3rd was this friend's birthday and they were going to
[01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:10.300]  have a full moon party and we had all been in nepal separately for some time and at the time
[01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:15.900]  in nepal there wasn't a lot of food variety for travelers you know generally when you would go to
[01:14:15.900 --> 01:14:21.980]  these small chai shops or whatnot they had what was called dal bat and it was rice and dal and
[01:14:21.980 --> 01:14:29.020]  it's not that this was not um delicious it was just monotonous so everybody lost weight when you
[01:14:29.020 --> 01:14:35.820]  traveled in nepal because there wasn't much food variety so these french devils made a mixture of
[01:14:35.820 --> 01:14:43.340]  dried fruit and macerated charas 100 grams of charas in this dry fruit mixture that was delicious
[01:14:43.340 --> 01:14:49.100]  but of course since all of us had not been eating anything sweet and had not had you know like
[01:14:49.100 --> 01:14:55.180]  something delicious to eat for a while we all all of these invite people who were invited to their
[01:14:55.180 --> 01:15:00.780]  party we ate far too much of this concoction without realizing how much these charas these
[01:15:00.780 --> 01:15:08.940]  french devils had put in the in the uh dessert and the rest of my memory for that evening is
[01:15:08.940 --> 01:15:13.500]  at some point we decided we were going to go looking for mushrooms and we were walking across
[01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:19.820]  this really large rice field in the moon lake and i remember like kind of levitating over there
[01:15:19.820 --> 01:15:26.620]  over the rice um and that's basically all i remember of the evening and so we hung out for
[01:15:26.620 --> 01:15:33.420]  a little bit in pokhara and then i needed to go to katmandu to have my passport restamped because
[01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:39.180]  they usually gave you visas for 30 days and i needed another 30 days so i ended up traveling
[01:15:39.180 --> 01:15:46.380]  with them to katmandu and then saying bye see you around and i ran into them randomly or i ran into
[01:15:46.380 --> 01:15:53.820]  frenchy frenchy randomly in manali which is in northern india all the way it would be like if i
[01:15:53.820 --> 01:16:01.100]  ran into you in eastern washington and then in colorado and then i ran into him in pushkar
[01:16:01.740 --> 01:16:10.780]  um in puri and then i was walking through the um like shopping area of varanasi which was little
[01:16:10.780 --> 01:16:16.940]  narrow streets with boutiques on each side and a hand reached out from the boutique and it was his
[01:16:16.940 --> 01:16:23.820]  friend and he said you need to stop following us and he said also there seems to be something going
[01:16:23.820 --> 01:16:29.580]  on here with the universe you just need to um meet us we're going to have frenchy's birthday
[01:16:29.660 --> 01:16:35.820]  in southern india so it was like again if we were maybe now in maine and he told me and we're going
[01:16:35.820 --> 01:16:40.780]  to be in florida in three weeks and we're going to have this birthday party at this place called
[01:16:40.780 --> 01:16:47.180]  ampy and in ampy there's these temple ruins so basically in three weeks we'll meet you and ampy
[01:16:47.180 --> 01:16:53.420]  at these temple ruins and i said well if my schedule allows maybe i'll see you there because
[01:16:53.420 --> 01:16:57.900]  i didn't want you know to be the one that was chasing somebody at that point
[01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:05.820]  but anyway so i took the train by myself to ampy i arrived at sunset this was like pre-cell phones
[01:17:05.820 --> 01:17:12.460]  there was no map i had no idea where these temple ruins were but i was 19 years old and optimistic
[01:17:12.460 --> 01:17:18.300]  and life was good to me and so i got out of the train and there was this large field in my memory
[01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:25.740]  of banana trees and they're not too tall you can kind of walk through them and um not be too tall
[01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:31.020]  and for whatever reason i had this idea if i walked through this grove of bananas on the other
[01:17:31.020 --> 01:17:37.820]  side will be this these temple ruins and i'll find frenchy and his friends and no sooner did i start
[01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:43.180]  walking through the banana trees then i kind of went around one and bumped right into frenchy
[01:17:43.980 --> 01:17:50.060]  um and so you know we had this a lot of fun with this birthday party and then i started traveling
[01:17:50.060 --> 01:17:56.140]  with them um around india for about nine months and at that point they had grown to be it was like
[01:17:56.140 --> 01:18:02.460]  seven or eight french men and me and we would get up and we would decide at the beginning of the day
[01:18:02.460 --> 01:18:08.700]  where we wanted to go what we wanted to do and we went all the way from southern india to you know
[01:18:08.700 --> 01:18:15.500]  all parts of northern india and yeah it was it was phenomenal that's beautiful thank you for

[01:19:44.860 --> 01:19:49.420]  the floor over to you before we go uh for any last words or thoughts that you may have
[01:19:51.260 --> 01:19:57.340]  people ask me what they think frenchy would tell us and i would say that he would tell you to just
[01:19:57.340 --> 01:20:03.740]  live your passion and to do it right away not wait don't follow some game plan that maybe some
[01:20:03.740 --> 01:20:09.980]  elder has put together for you that says something along the lines of work for 40 years save money
[01:20:09.980 --> 01:20:14.780]  and then do what you want to do because look at what would have happened if frenchy and i had
[01:20:14.780 --> 01:20:20.380]  followed that game plan that our parents have wanted because i'll be 65 next year so i would
[01:20:20.380 --> 01:20:25.740]  have found myself with a bunch of money and alone and what fun is that whereas taking we used to
[01:20:25.740 --> 01:20:31.180]  joke that we took our retirement up front we traveled throughout our 20s before we had our
[01:20:31.180 --> 01:20:36.940]  daughter you know we had the freedom to do what we wanted to do when we wanted to to do it we spent
[01:20:36.940 --> 01:20:43.740]  six months on a desert island together when you know i was like 20 and frenchy was 23 um so yeah
[01:20:43.740 --> 01:20:50.860]  there's a lot to be said for trusting in the destiny that life has planned for you and really
[01:20:50.860 --> 01:20:56.460]  following your passion whatever that might be you know frenchy people look at frenchy and think
[01:20:56.460 --> 01:21:02.300]  oh he was just into hash but that's not true frenchy was an artist he had a lot of handbags
[01:21:02.300 --> 01:21:08.620]  when we lived in japan um you know he did translation he was interested in ancient history
[01:21:08.620 --> 01:21:13.740]  so i just encourage he used to encourage young people get all the education that you can as well
[01:21:13.740 --> 01:21:20.380]  because education is a cool thing that will open all kinds of doors for you and you should really
[01:21:20.380 --> 01:21:27.260]  geek out on what makes your heart sing regardless of how other people feel about that um so yeah
[01:21:27.260 --> 01:21:34.300]  that's what i would wish to all the younger people out there is really embrace your passion
[01:21:34.300 --> 01:21:40.940]  and have confidence in that ignore the internet and all that kind of influencer chatter around
