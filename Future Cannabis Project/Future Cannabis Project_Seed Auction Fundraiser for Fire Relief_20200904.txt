[00:01.020 --> 00:05.020]  I just want to see it with my own eyes.
[00:05.020 --> 00:08.020]  Hold on a second.
[00:08.020 --> 00:12.020]  What are these people commenting on?
[00:12.020 --> 00:14.020]  Oh, wow.
[00:14.020 --> 00:16.020]  All right.
[00:16.020 --> 00:18.020]  There we are.
[00:18.020 --> 00:20.020]  The Lord has risen.
[00:20.020 --> 00:22.020]  I saw it.
[00:22.020 --> 00:24.020]  Hell yeah.
[00:24.020 --> 00:26.020]  All right.
[00:26.020 --> 00:28.020]  So, I don't even know where to begin.
[00:28.020 --> 00:30.020]  So, all right.
[00:30.020 --> 00:38.020]  Tonight we are doing a seed auction fundraiser.
[00:38.020 --> 00:43.020]  We — there are a lot of people who need help right now.
[00:43.020 --> 00:52.020]  A lot of people who were victims of the fire and a whole lot of other things, or fires around mostly California.
[00:52.020 --> 00:55.020]  We can't be all things to all people.
[00:55.020 --> 00:57.020]  We got to start somewhere.
[00:57.020 --> 01:01.020]  So, we picked two people.
[01:01.020 --> 01:04.020]  One of them is on with us currently.
[01:04.020 --> 01:08.020]  That is Sean from Herb Farms.
[01:08.020 --> 01:12.020]  And his farm burnt down.
[01:12.020 --> 01:22.000]  And Sean, that was in — you're in Alameda County?
[01:22.000 --> 01:31.000]  Yeah, we're at the very tip of Alameda County where it meets Santa Clara and San Joaquin, I believe.
[01:31.000 --> 01:35.000]  It's like a three-way right there.
[01:35.000 --> 01:40.000]  And can you just kind of talk — I mean, what day did this happen?
[01:40.000 --> 01:44.000]  I mean, today is September 4th.
[01:44.000 --> 01:56.000]  It's kind of a blur, but it started about — the lightning happened on Sunday morning, I believe.
[01:56.000 --> 02:02.000]  And then Monday we started seeing smoke, but it was blowing away from us.
[02:02.000 --> 02:05.000]  The whole time it was blowing away from us.
[02:06.000 --> 02:16.000]  And then four days later, it pretty much made it over our ridge and then came down through all the scrub oak and pine trees.
[02:16.000 --> 02:21.000]  And we had 12,000 gallons, so we thought, you know, maybe we could save it.
[02:21.000 --> 02:25.000]  Yeah, it was not very smart, honestly.
[02:25.000 --> 02:29.000]  The power of this thing was pretty incredible.
[02:29.000 --> 02:32.000]  Have you ever experienced a fire like this?
[02:32.000 --> 02:35.000]  No, I was ignorant to the power of this thing.
[02:35.000 --> 02:41.000]  And then, you know, watching it come down that hill and against the wind, you know, the whole time we were thinking,
[02:41.000 --> 02:43.000]  the wind's blowing it the other way, we're going to be safe.
[02:43.000 --> 02:47.000]  And I see a lot of people posting those same type of pictures.
[02:47.000 --> 02:50.000]  And maybe it worked out for them, but for us, it came right towards us.
[02:50.000 --> 02:57.000]  And, you know, the firefighters pulled out when the wind picked up, probably because they knew how dangerous it would be.
[02:57.000 --> 03:10.000]  And we stayed and tried to fend it off and we back burned a little bit towards it and that worked until the ridge over where my neighbors were,
[03:10.000 --> 03:15.000]  it went down behind us and then the wind blew it up behind us through the scrub oak.
[03:15.000 --> 03:23.000]  And then when the wind picked up, it's just all of it, just all the stuff we put out, everything just turned towards us.
[03:23.000 --> 03:29.000]  And the trailer was in flames within a minute or two of the wind turning.
[03:29.000 --> 03:37.000]  It was, I mean, we even took a video, like we saved the farm, you know.
[03:37.000 --> 03:43.000]  You know, I really appreciate everybody doing this for us.
[03:43.000 --> 03:49.000]  And it was definitely some tough moments, some sobering moments.
[03:49.000 --> 04:01.000]  You know, I try to put on a good face, but it was really hard to see a place that you put blood, sweat and tears into for nine years just go up in flames.
[04:01.000 --> 04:06.000]  You know, it's just all the animals, everything, you know, just gone.
[04:06.000 --> 04:10.000]  And how many square feet was the farm?
[04:11.000 --> 04:30.000]  We had three different parcels. We're still, you know, just kind of under the radar type thing, you know, because Alameda County, we tried to get in and then the pilot program happened and then, you know, I guess we weren't buddies with enough people and
[04:31.000 --> 04:37.000]  we didn't have enough funding and they're not really playing ball and unincorporated Alameda County right now.
[04:37.000 --> 04:40.000]  They have a fishing club and that's pretty much it.
[04:40.000 --> 04:41.000]  Right.
[04:41.000 --> 04:47.000]  So just to kind of give people some context.
[04:47.000 --> 04:58.000]  I think everybody who's on here tonight has done stuff to raise money for someone at some point or other.
[04:58.000 --> 05:14.000]  You know, Jackson, who's coming on has been doing a ton of just stuff on Instagram and, you know, we did something a couple weeks ago to raise some money for Delano, who, you know, we all believe is an entrepreneur who could use the helping hand.
[05:14.000 --> 05:20.000]  Last year I did something for people in Malibu and other people have done other stuff.
[05:20.000 --> 05:27.000]  And I think what's unique is seeing the cannabis industry step up.
[05:27.000 --> 05:36.000]  I mean, I feel like every year California has the apocalypse of like it's a variety pack of apocalypses.
[05:36.000 --> 05:43.000]  It's mudslides, it's fires, it's, you know, all sorts of stuff.
[05:43.000 --> 05:51.000]  And something like this, which is like a live auction, can provide kind of immediate help.
[05:51.000 --> 06:02.000]  But in the background, we're trying to build out something more substantive where it can be an enduring, you know, this is a synchronous experience.
[06:03.000 --> 06:07.000]  So like everybody one place at the same time, almost like a telethon.
[06:07.000 --> 06:25.000]  But the concept is, you know, you could have people who want to donate to causes and they may not even know what the cause is going to be, but they can make donations and then other people who are recipients who are in need, whether it's a nonprofit individual who's been hit by something.
[06:26.000 --> 06:44.000]  And just this community coming together over and over. And I think for me, part of the bigger picture is showing the rest of the world that when shit happens, whatever you may think of all of us, you know, we're out there raising money for people.
[06:45.000 --> 06:55.000]  You know, we talked about tomorrow night doing something for Food Not Bombs has nothing to do with cannabis, but they need blankets, they need tents, they need food.
[06:56.000 --> 07:13.000]  So anyway, that's the context of what this is. And tonight we have Sean and actually Brett's joining us and then he can tell us the story of his farm, but a whole bunch of breeders stepped up people who aren't breeders who have other types of products want to give stuff.
[07:14.000 --> 07:24.000]  I think tomorrow night we'll have some non kind of seed related items. I know like Blue Matt wanted to donate some stuff, grassroots fabric pot companies like that.
[07:25.000 --> 07:41.000]  But anyway, I'm going to turn it over to Josh to maybe kick us off and Sean and Brett's still connecting. You got to bear with us too. We've never done something like this before.
[07:41.000 --> 07:51.000]  So I think, you know, one auction may be for Sean, one may be for Brett, it may go, you know, one of you is going to come out with more money than the other. Don't be pissed at the other guy.
[07:52.000 --> 08:05.000]  You know, we're all just trying to do our best and everybody watching, you know, we understand that not everybody has lots of money, but hopefully, I think soon we'll have stuff which will be like $50 items.
[08:05.000 --> 08:25.000]  You can also, someone asked if you can make donations. So yeah, if you want to just make a donation to Sean or to Brett, for example, here is, you know, if you wanted for, this is Sean, so you could Venmo, LaCasse, McDiaz, $2, $5, $10, anything helps.
[08:26.000 --> 08:47.000]  And then eventually we'll have, you know, stuff that is for the less affluent, you know, $10, $50, $100 items. So everybody can participate. But with that, I'll hand it off to Josh and we can get things started.
[08:49.000 --> 08:53.000]  I was going to say, have you invited like Family Tree and...
[08:53.000 --> 08:54.000]  Oh, right.
[08:55.000 --> 09:01.000]  Invite those guys, Mr. Bob Hemphill, Cricut and Cicada, North Coast Genetics.
[09:02.000 --> 09:03.000]  Good God. All right.
[09:04.000 --> 09:10.000]  So you got those, you get those three guys going on and we'll start it off with, start the auction off with those guys.
[09:11.000 --> 09:15.000]  All right. So sorry, just quickly, Bob, Tyler, Family Tree, who else?
[09:16.000 --> 09:26.650]  North Coast. He's on standby. But yeah, maybe Brett, are you there? I saw you popped on.
[09:27.650 --> 09:28.650]  I'm here.
[09:29.650 --> 09:30.650]  Hey, bud.
[09:30.650 --> 09:31.650]  Yeah.
[09:31.650 --> 09:39.650]  You want to share with us a bit about your situation, man? We haven't met before, but I'm really sorry to hear about your situation, dude.
[09:40.650 --> 09:57.180]  Thank you. Yeah, it's a little devastating. I lived just near Big Basin State Park, which got burned up as well. And, you know, lightning storm was one of the most magical nights of my life.
[09:58.180 --> 10:08.180]  I stayed up from 1230 to 730 watching, you know, every few seconds, lightning touched ground all over Santa Cruz and there were 22 fires by sunrise.
[10:09.180 --> 10:20.180]  Three of them on the north coast on the backside of Big Basin State Park, the first state park in California, really took off over a couple of days.
[10:21.180 --> 10:25.180]  We had some dry, hot weather and it was a very tough area for them to access.
[10:26.180 --> 10:39.180]  And it burned through the park and within, you know, a few hours of getting a random evacuation notice for San Mateo, we watched it go get really serious.
[10:39.180 --> 10:48.180]  And we heard the fire trucks come on both sides of us and hear them working. And then a helicopter came overhead and just said, get the fuck out.
[10:48.180 --> 11:07.180]  And at that point, I didn't even have, you know, I honestly kind of just went into a state of fear and really didn't have myself together enough to understand what to take and what not to take and grabbed a small handful of valuables and
[11:08.180 --> 11:23.180]  really had high hopes that it wasn't going to be the reality that it is today, which is pretty much my entire, you know, seed library, which was impressively large, along with everything that I own for the most part, except for this Prius load of
[11:24.180 --> 11:35.180]  random, you know, ashes of my grand, you know, random stuff that as you run around your house and look at what is it in your house you don't want, you know.
[11:36.180 --> 11:55.180]  The trash can usually. So I kind of got lost in that for the little bit that I stayed in the house after the helicopter said get the fuck out. And luckily my friend Mariah was there and she was like, you just got to go.
[11:56.180 --> 12:14.180]  And yeah, it's just, you know, maybe a day later we found out that everything burned down. My neighbor, the neighbors stayed behind and tried to fight with the assistance of some retired fire crews but unfortunately our whole neighborhood everything was lost.
[12:16.180 --> 12:18.180]  How long have you had you lived there.
[12:18.180 --> 12:19.180]  No, really.
[12:20.180 --> 12:24.180]  I've been there. This would have been my 11th season growing there.
[12:26.180 --> 12:33.520]  And so 11 years. I definitely had spread out, you know, and
[12:34.520 --> 12:55.520]  yeah, it's just it's devastating. To be honest, I went back I left Santa Cruz and went to the Sierras where I'm currently at. And that was actually a planned little trip to begin with. So it's just escape since we evacuated I might as well have had somewhere where it's less smoky and I've been back to Santa Cruz and I really couldn't handle.
[12:56.520 --> 13:11.520]  I mean, I was overwhelmed by the love and support of the community from all the centers they've set up and all the things they're doing, and was just extremely humbled by the generosity and kindness from all walks of life.
[13:12.520 --> 13:29.520]  All different folks are helping out so many, I mean there's 1000 I haven't followed it recently but 1000 homes were probably lost in this fire, being at the evacuation center and visiting a friend and just seeing like how
[13:30.520 --> 13:52.520]  how real that is and how humbling that is. I'm a longtime psychedelic user and I joke that and I can't believe that I'm experiencing this through a natural means of something I didn't eat, but when you lose everything like this you realize what's really important, which is your connections and your friends and community.
[13:54.520 --> 13:57.240]  Sorry, did I cut out there.
[13:58.240 --> 14:01.240]  Sorry, man. No, you're there man.
[14:02.240 --> 14:26.240]  Okay, so yeah, it really, it's humbling to you know to lose everything like that and really realize what's important is that you've got yourself and your, and your community and these things that we collect sure have a lot of attachment to these items but you know at the end of the day,
[14:26.240 --> 14:34.240]  there are things that were made and created and shared and purchase and collected and that can be done again but you know.
[14:36.240 --> 14:37.240]  Yeah.
[14:39.240 --> 14:40.240]  Yeah, sorry.
[14:41.240 --> 14:48.240]  So, yeah, it's just, it's really been an eye opening learning experience for me.
[14:49.240 --> 15:05.240]  And I'm very humbled by everyone's generosity and help all of you included. And it's, yeah, it's been very difficult for me to communicate and accept all this gracious support.
[15:06.240 --> 15:25.240]  Just not. I'm used to just kind of working for mine and earning it in a speak and it's, it's really a huge lesson in acceptance and appreciation of everyone else's efforts to be so kind, and it's humbling and
[15:27.240 --> 15:31.240]  powerful experience, probably the most powerful experience I've ever lived through.
[15:31.240 --> 15:48.240]  It's about what you've given back to the community to like, yeah, I mean, through Cali depth fest and the way you like united all of these different people in the cannabis community like I've met such amazing people and connections through you, and I just value so much and.
[15:49.240 --> 15:51.240]  Yeah, no, it's what you put out there just comes back.
[15:52.240 --> 16:15.490]  Yeah, thank you, Jesse. I know that was a, that was a great experience. I'm sad that we, you know, that that's kind of fallen to the wayside but it definitely was a great way for a lot of folks of like minded to share their knowledge and community, much like you do, Peter, and it's great to see.
[16:17.490 --> 16:23.490]  It's great to see all those connections kind of reaching out I definitely, I definitely feel like I've been able to do that.
[16:24.490 --> 16:38.490]  Definitely, you know, through the help of depth fest and really the Emerald Cup, I have to give them a ton of credit, the Blake's and those folks really and and Bali and Bam from coastal seeds Bollywood Bam highest grade.
[16:39.490 --> 16:53.490]  All those folks kind of took me under their wings somewhat and really helped create that and that really was a great outreach for our whole community, I think, and I think it still is, you know, I think it still is and stuff like this is a
[16:54.490 --> 17:05.490]  great avenue for me to just really learn and appreciate how great of a community, we really have, and I feel very blessed to be part of it.
[17:09.020 --> 17:11.020]  I feel like we should get the first item up.
[17:12.020 --> 17:23.020]  So, just quickly, let's buy a minute I just texted Tyler to tell him that he's up. He was like me cooking dinner for the up he's on his way.
[17:24.020 --> 17:27.020]  For those of you who have kids you can appreciate.
[17:29.020 --> 17:30.020]  Big cab.
[17:33.020 --> 17:34.020]  Can you hear us what's up Kevin.
[17:43.480 --> 17:44.480]  He is.
[17:50.420 --> 17:51.420]  I can hear him.
[17:54.420 --> 17:55.420]  Can you hear us Kevin.
[18:04.160 --> 18:09.160]  Well, why don't you pause with that Jordan is mouth looking like looking all tough.
[18:15.160 --> 18:17.160]  Josh, do you want to.
[18:18.160 --> 18:21.160]  Let's talk I can start talking about what Tyler was. Yeah.
[18:22.160 --> 18:29.160]  So, until he pops on, but Tyler is a is a cool guy down in Southern California, he is.
[18:30.160 --> 18:46.160]  He does a lot of work with trees and fruit trees and that's why he calls it family tree seeds, but he popped a bag seed years ago when he was in high school, and he started crossing this thing he named it Pam Anderson, and when the phylos thing.
[18:48.160 --> 18:59.160]  And there to get tested, and it was a totally soul, you know standalone cultivar that had no nothing related to it and so it's, it's really interesting in that and
[19:02.160 --> 19:13.160]  I just popped a bunch of them man I'm really excited to see it, it's a it's a really beautiful cultivar it's more sativa leaning tall it's got that those red leaves super frosty.
[19:14.160 --> 19:27.160]  You know it's kind of all I can talk about it really that much but he's got he's got a bunch of different versions of it that he's wanted to auction off tonight and I can't remember there's a BX, and I think the original one cross he made.
[19:28.160 --> 19:29.160]  So hopefully he'll pop on here.
[19:30.160 --> 19:31.160]  Any second.
[19:33.160 --> 19:36.160]  Yeah, so actually it's here's the first one we go.
[19:37.160 --> 19:39.160]  Yeah, and he's coming in right now look at that timing.
[19:40.160 --> 19:41.160]  All right.
[19:44.390 --> 19:46.390]  Rotate your camera.
[19:48.390 --> 19:50.390]  Can you rotate 90 degrees.
[19:52.390 --> 19:53.390]  There we go.
[19:54.390 --> 20:01.660]  Alright so Tyler you are up, let me, which one do you want to start with.
[20:03.660 --> 20:08.660]  Let's, uh, yeah let's start with the BX let's start with the, with the real thing.
[20:08.660 --> 20:14.660]  Okay, and who's this one guy are we gonna do the first one for Sean or Brett.
[20:16.660 --> 20:17.660]  And we'll get to both of you.
[20:18.660 --> 20:21.660]  Let's go back and forth let's start with Sean since he came in first.
[20:22.660 --> 20:27.660]  All right, let's start with some basics of like who to email how to pay that sort of deal so these guys know the scoop.
[20:27.660 --> 20:46.660]  Yeah, so this is the other thing Sean and Brett can you guys check your PayPal and Venmo to confirm like when someone wins and they say they've made a payment that it went through because we've had issues in the past where, you know, someone wins and then they basically ghost us.
[20:47.660 --> 20:50.660]  We won't name names but everybody knows who they are.
[20:50.660 --> 20:51.660]  So sorry.
[20:52.660 --> 20:54.660]  Yeah, I'll be right back.
[20:55.660 --> 20:58.660]  Staten Island is really me. I just got excited that night.
[20:59.660 --> 21:01.660]  And what do we have Soviet smoker.
[21:02.660 --> 21:04.660]  Yeah, yeah, that was me too.
[21:10.660 --> 21:11.660]  Okay.
[21:11.660 --> 21:19.440]  Soviet smoker. Yeah, that was me too.
[21:32.090 --> 21:42.050]  So tell us about Pam. Introduce us to Pam real quick. So Pam is an old-school
[21:42.050 --> 21:48.730]  bag seed from 99 to 2003 era. Sometime in that in that era that's where she
[21:48.730 --> 21:58.050]  came from. She's been a clone of mine for going you know six, seven years, something
[21:58.050 --> 22:07.690]  like that. She is extremely close to landrace, really strong genetics, breeds
[22:07.690 --> 22:14.130]  extremely strong, dominant in most of the traits. If you put it on some of
[22:14.130 --> 22:17.650]  the nastiest gassy stuff you've ever seen in your life, she'll turn it fruit
[22:17.650 --> 22:21.450]  just like that. You know what I mean? Male or female, doesn't matter if you breed
[22:21.450 --> 22:25.490]  it with a male or a female. The line is strong and it'll turn it long and it'll
[22:25.490 --> 22:31.610]  turn it stretchy and sativa. I was recently talking with the Indian
[22:31.610 --> 22:37.170]  landrace exchange guy, I forget his name, awesome dude, and over the past couple
[22:37.250 --> 22:39.970]  years I've been working on trying to figure out what she was because I never
[22:39.970 --> 22:45.210]  knew. Did some genetic testing, never got a lot of you know direct answers, but
[22:45.210 --> 22:51.810]  she's always been too special to let go. So I you know I've got I've got deep in
[22:51.810 --> 22:56.250]  the you know deeper under the Sun of the generations and a lot of her purple stem
[22:56.250 --> 23:01.370]  traits started coming out and at bloom set a lot of the phenotypes, most of the
[23:01.370 --> 23:07.130]  phenotypes have you know straight red stems, red dark purple stems. They'll be
[23:07.130 --> 23:13.050]  green most of the time except for the petioles on most of them and at bloom
[23:13.050 --> 23:19.970]  set they'll start turning red. That is a characteristic of India and that
[23:19.970 --> 23:24.530]  type of you know Himalayan type you know region, some Pakistan genetics. So I've
[23:24.530 --> 23:29.170]  been doing lots of research and trying to figure out what was
[23:29.170 --> 23:33.970]  going on and I reached out to the Indian landrace exchange guy and I was like yo
[23:33.970 --> 23:36.970]  I sent him a bunch of pictures and I'm like I've been I've been trying to deal
[23:36.970 --> 23:41.530]  with this for years. Maybe on your travels out in India have you ever seen
[23:41.530 --> 23:46.610]  anything that kind of resembles this and he right away he was like oh yeah here's
[23:46.610 --> 23:49.770]  here's some stuff that looks just like this from the from the Wailing Valley
[23:49.770 --> 23:55.930]  and the morphological characteristics are extremely strong to
[23:55.930 --> 24:01.850]  that valley. Higher elevation closer to 3,000 which explains the really good
[24:01.850 --> 24:08.090]  resin content that she gets on her. All the tones and terp things to kind of
[24:08.090 --> 24:13.530]  check out, height, size of the plants, all those types of things. So I was right
[24:13.530 --> 24:18.530]  on at diagnosing kind of that region and I'm almost certain that it's coming
[24:18.530 --> 24:24.850]  from that that area. Really pleasant, really experiential cannabis. There's
[24:24.850 --> 24:29.050]  some CBD in there as well and that's one of the things that the that the gene
[24:29.090 --> 24:32.930]  report revealed there's there's some CBD traits that were locked in there and
[24:32.930 --> 24:37.370]  that region also that particular thing does have that as well. So it's like it's
[24:37.370 --> 24:41.130]  it's starting to check those boxes so we're looking we're looking at you know
[24:41.130 --> 24:47.690]  Himalayan Indian, Western Himalayan type cannabis. Easily six to twelve foot in
[24:47.690 --> 24:54.650]  growth habit. Badass resistance, extra good resin, colorful as all hell and if
[24:54.650 --> 24:59.810]  you see some of the pictures they'll be you know reds and blues and blacks and
[24:59.810 --> 25:06.090]  purples and just just nasty nasty nasty cool colors. She clones quicker than
[25:06.090 --> 25:09.930]  anything. One of the fastest cloners I've ever had. She wants to survive. Most
[25:09.930 --> 25:15.290]  things are you know that that 10 to 14 day range. She's always on point like
[25:15.290 --> 25:19.250]  seven, eight days. She's she's ready to root, ready to rock and roll. She's always
[25:19.250 --> 25:22.130]  the first one to spit roots which is great. It's one of my favorite things
[25:22.130 --> 25:29.850]  that I look for. Bugs, disease. I mean here in SoCal she's been growing you
[25:29.850 --> 25:34.530]  know all the stuff that I've done. She's pretty much well adapted here. She
[25:34.530 --> 25:38.930]  loves she loves the hot. She loves the dry but she does do well in other
[25:38.930 --> 25:45.570]  conditions. So very very fun plant. Very very heavy producing plant. She'll get
[25:45.570 --> 25:51.970]  crazy crazy branches with with excellent excellent sphere nugs on them
[25:52.010 --> 25:58.770]  in all directions. That particular BX is the PAM one the one you know my my
[25:58.770 --> 26:04.770]  keeper lover that got hit with the with the F2 generation selected stud and I
[26:04.770 --> 26:08.450]  pulled out a whole bunch of them and you know I I let a few of them hit a few
[26:08.450 --> 26:13.530]  things and there was just one stud above and beyond. He just had the most the most
[26:13.530 --> 26:18.850]  pollen drop the most stank and the most swagger of them all and he's he's the
[26:18.850 --> 26:25.170]  one that went back to the PAM one as well as a couple other things and the
[26:25.170 --> 26:29.170]  plants that are coming out of there are extremely she's already breeding pretty
[26:29.170 --> 26:33.850]  strong. So like I said you could you could you could hit her to the shortest
[26:33.850 --> 26:37.090]  squattiest nastiest indica the most different thing on planet Earth and
[26:37.090 --> 26:41.690]  she's gonna change it to to herself. So that BX really furthered her turt
[26:41.690 --> 26:46.930]  profile a little bit and and the more that her her her stature is like every
[26:46.930 --> 26:50.810]  single every single plant just looks exactly like her stand in there which is
[26:50.810 --> 26:55.810]  which is way cool. There's some variation on the you know the resin and the way
[26:55.810 --> 27:01.050]  that the color is comes in on the on the flower but all in all it's it's it's
[27:01.050 --> 27:04.810]  very very close to lots of them. There's some there's some stuff that's been way
[27:04.810 --> 27:11.050]  cool like extremely awesome. I'm waiting waiting for those to finish up so that I
[27:11.090 --> 27:14.730]  can really kind of dive into experience and stuff but through this whole testing
[27:14.730 --> 27:18.850]  process they're coming out very similar. We're gonna do it again here pretty soon
[27:18.850 --> 27:22.450]  and just try to you know keep the party rolling but I'm not releasing any of
[27:22.450 --> 27:25.050]  these I'm just this is just something that I'm just trying to work on so that
[27:25.050 --> 27:30.050]  I can get it get her you know cubed up a little bit better and see what happens
[27:30.050 --> 27:34.850]  you know as she gets further inbred. Doing some S1's with their own stuff but
[27:34.850 --> 27:40.770]  this is some cool special stuff that anybody wants some weird cool you know
[27:40.770 --> 27:45.490]  good experience good growth good characteristics for breeding stock. It's
[27:45.490 --> 27:53.100]  it's it's you know it's second to none really really cool plants. And so which
[27:53.100 --> 27:59.380]  one do we want to start with? Dude thank you very much for donation. Yes yeah my
[27:59.380 --> 28:03.700]  pleasure you know I'm just happy I can help you know I'm lucky enough right now
[28:03.700 --> 28:07.940]  we're not burning down so should it be my worst nightmare you know if I can
[28:08.060 --> 28:12.660]  help out my dad's a retired firefighter you know so no stranger to flames you
[28:12.660 --> 28:17.820]  know what I mean and what they do so you know I'm just glad that I can you know I
[28:17.820 --> 28:22.900]  have something that I can offer you know it's definitely worse on me. All right so
[28:22.900 --> 28:28.460]  so let's pick one to start with you want to do the Pandemic the PAM 15 F3 or the
[28:28.460 --> 28:36.020]  PAM 1 BX? Let's do the BX let's do the PAM 1 the BX. Cascadian can you get a
[28:36.140 --> 28:41.820]  timer and run chat I'm lagging in internet so I can't see chat actually if
[28:41.820 --> 28:51.660]  you can command that and let's do a five minute timer on this. Okay what are we
[28:51.660 --> 29:03.100]  starting to that? What do you think Josh? Pick the number Josh. Those are BX's I
[29:03.100 --> 29:08.660]  would be I would start those at least at least 300 400. Let's start them at 300.
[29:08.660 --> 29:16.540]  Let's start them at 300. Never gonna get them. Special thing. Yeah so you were saying before
[29:16.540 --> 29:22.260]  these are things that you don't release. Yeah this is yeah this is this is like
[29:22.260 --> 29:27.540]  the only reason that I would that I actually you know would release it not
[29:27.540 --> 29:31.620]  only is it gonna help somebody you know in a big way but you know it's the way
[29:31.620 --> 29:35.820]  to make sure that she lives you know she's been around too long it's she's
[29:35.820 --> 29:40.620]  too she's too awesome not to have more people grow her. I don't have a big enough
[29:40.620 --> 29:43.580]  operation where I can put out as many clones I'd like to just send her out
[29:43.580 --> 29:48.740]  that way so man everybody who grows the PAM and you can see on my feed you can
[29:48.740 --> 29:53.820]  you can you can you can see it anybody who pops those seeds they're ecstatic
[29:53.820 --> 29:57.940]  for what happens and how she grows and she always sets she always sets the
[29:57.940 --> 30:03.460]  standard you know so this like I said this is this is a part of my a part of
[30:03.460 --> 30:08.660]  my project this is my start you know some of my building blocks for what I'm
[30:08.660 --> 30:13.180]  gonna end up with in the long term and like I said if there's a lot of people
[30:13.180 --> 30:18.300]  out there is trying to you know get something new and unusual kind of sits
[30:18.300 --> 30:21.640]  in their own little round like you know that's this is breeding stock this is
[30:21.640 --> 30:26.940]  stuff that you know that that will be weaved into stuff for many different
[30:26.940 --> 30:33.740]  traits not only smoke ability and resin and all and clone ability resistance I
[30:33.740 --> 30:38.220]  mean it's a it's a bitching plant she does a lot of cool stuff and when you
[30:38.220 --> 30:43.780]  look at it you don't like you can look I can look at a room full of plants and
[30:43.780 --> 30:50.460]  you can always pick out PAM she is it's like undeniable unmistakable you put her
[30:50.460 --> 30:55.260]  in a sea of plants of hundreds of plants and you'll just see her stature or her
[30:55.340 --> 31:01.020]  shape or it's just some sort of a just a sharp characteristic that makes you
[31:01.020 --> 31:04.540]  look in her direction it doesn't look like normal normal stuff when you're
[31:04.540 --> 31:11.580]  just looking at her you know it's pretty cool grows like an SOB it's not for a
[31:11.580 --> 31:17.980]  two-by-two tent you know that's for sure it can be weaved in and done but she's
[31:17.980 --> 31:22.220]  gonna you'll be a potting like crazy and you know you'll be weaving till the cows
[31:22.300 --> 31:28.700]  come home so she loves her space if you got it it's that's what that's what it
[31:28.700 --> 31:33.420]  does but yes I've only released one other pack of this and it was for
[31:33.420 --> 31:49.520]  charity as well so this particular pack isn't out there anybody familiar with
[31:49.520 --> 31:56.720]  any cannabis from the the upper elevation of the India actually I'm
[31:56.720 --> 32:01.040]  growing some of the Milano right now the Wailing Valley and I was I'm friends
[32:01.040 --> 32:05.560]  with who you're talking about from the I was just talking with them right now
[32:05.560 --> 32:11.840]  and he's gonna join tomorrow and all of this stuff but yeah we've talked about
[32:11.840 --> 32:17.560]  the red stem and the areas like forever yeah it's pretty interesting too because
[32:17.560 --> 32:21.440]  one thing you see is a lot of times will be half the population will be red stem
[32:21.440 --> 32:26.520]  or or sometimes less but like it doesn't fully take over one way or the
[32:26.520 --> 32:31.920]  other and some you know it's kind of a mystery like why that you know why we've
[32:31.920 --> 32:35.840]  just like there's a lot of different areas but I see it in a few of the
[32:35.840 --> 32:40.680]  different varieties some of the like holy Nana crack and the banana crosses
[32:40.680 --> 32:45.760]  that I've done I've seen like you know that 10 20% of those red stocks coming
[32:45.760 --> 32:49.360]  out and you know I see it over and over again he always you know I'm always
[32:49.360 --> 32:52.400]  sending him back and forth and he's like dude it looks just like from here
[32:52.400 --> 32:57.640]  and it's like I wonder what went into it yeah yeah it's such a treat to get to
[32:57.640 --> 33:02.120]  talk to him because he's just you know well yeah it's nice to be able to see
[33:02.120 --> 33:07.680]  he's young too and just like so much knowledge because he's just there you
[33:07.680 --> 33:11.160]  know learning from the communities boots on the ground man and he really pays
[33:11.160 --> 33:14.800]  attention to the plant you know just super thoughtful so I mean yeah I'm
[33:14.800 --> 33:18.360]  stoked he's gonna try to join tomorrow the only issue though I don't Peter is
[33:18.360 --> 33:22.200]  India has a ban on zoom so I don't know if there's another way we can get them
[33:22.200 --> 33:31.240]  on yeah yeah now so the f3 generation like the pen the the pan 15 I pulled out
[33:31.240 --> 33:35.200]  is a red stem pheno that's one of my favorites and I made the f3 with that
[33:35.200 --> 33:39.520]  pheno and in doing that it really it really brought out that red stem to at
[33:39.520 --> 33:43.720]  least half or a little bit more than half or really really dominant red stems
[33:43.720 --> 33:47.000]  I was cutting I was cutting more red stems out of there than that I've ever
[33:47.000 --> 33:50.680]  seen before and that's really what made me notice I was like oh shit really
[33:50.680 --> 33:54.360]  pretty and it's like really pretty and it was like really prominent you know I
[33:54.360 --> 33:58.600]  was like okay yeah that's that's it that's this telling me now you know I
[33:58.600 --> 34:02.800]  had to wait long enough talk to her long enough and finally you know you know got
[34:02.800 --> 34:06.920]  to me but I was almost certain and then right when he said that I was like I
[34:06.920 --> 34:12.320]  asked I said it on video beforehand and I'll show you some pictures and you're
[34:12.320 --> 34:18.280]  like what like yeah exactly so it's pretty damn close but mine like I said
[34:18.280 --> 34:24.360]  the the resin on those things are out of the control I mean as soon as you get
[34:24.360 --> 34:30.200]  her deep in it just gets so pretty and so nasty and lots of these really
[34:30.200 --> 34:35.320]  intricate resin rails really get in this it's a bitchin friggin plant dude it's
[34:35.320 --> 34:40.160]  really like I said it's a bitchin plant so you got those uh it's like that big
[34:40.160 --> 34:44.200]  league I always see the big league to the big league great great to the old
[34:44.200 --> 34:47.440]  big big to in the pack it's like that big league great to you know with some
[34:47.440 --> 34:53.280]  some musty funk in there some you know some some sort of nastiness in there in
[34:53.280 --> 34:56.120]  the back you know what I mean but it's that big league to right up front
[34:56.120 --> 34:59.720]  especially early on in flower and it's just friggin lip-smacking it's like so
[34:59.720 --> 35:04.520]  it's like fake smell and it's so right on you know what I mean it's really cool
[35:04.520 --> 35:07.960]  and the 15 the path to do she's completely different she looked really
[35:07.960 --> 35:12.760]  different said we'll talk about that later but it's just so funny how the but
[35:12.760 --> 35:16.920]  the resins like that one thing that holds true you know it's got that you
[35:16.920 --> 35:21.800]  know that higher elevation that sheen on it you know really get Sheenie all right
[35:21.800 --> 35:30.320]  so cascadian who won that we had somebody good in the time at 400 and
[35:30.320 --> 35:34.560]  somebody after the time at 410 so I don't know how we want to handle that we
[35:34.560 --> 35:41.880]  take we take snipes for sure anybody anybody who anybody who buys pack or
[35:41.880 --> 35:47.160]  gets the pack questions or you know anything you know I'd love to talk I
[35:47.160 --> 35:50.880]  love to help you love to do a lot of stuff so you get you know you'll get
[35:50.880 --> 35:55.360]  you'll get some help you get some you know some tips some funny things too if
[35:55.360 --> 35:58.760]  you want them you know so you know I always offer if you know if you want you
[35:58.760 --> 36:14.360]  know so just quickly so MV Alchem or MV natural farming you want it email me
[36:14.360 --> 36:24.200]  Peter at future cannabis project org and then also go to we were doing Sean for
[36:24.200 --> 36:31.400]  the first one so go there the Venmo is I'm gonna put it in the chat and then
[36:31.400 --> 36:35.120]  Sean if you can just confirm that he paid so we don't have to put it back up
[36:35.120 --> 36:46.560]  on the auction block yep I'll confirm hold on one second and we let so let's
[36:46.560 --> 36:53.560]  go to the and I'm gonna put the Venmo I can't do eight things at once but um so
[36:53.840 --> 37:03.440]  you want to do the Pam 15 f3 next or the pandemic yeah 15 yeah let's do the 15
[37:03.440 --> 37:10.120]  that's my baby we'll start a five minute turn timer now what do you want to start
[37:10.120 --> 37:16.160]  that one off for let's start a timer let's start that one at two two bills
[37:16.160 --> 37:23.600]  two bills all right I'll start the timer to also unreleased not gonna be
[37:23.600 --> 37:30.320]  released Nick Nick Nick Nick rise then my boy he's the only other person really
[37:30.320 --> 37:33.720]  to get the Pam 15 one other person other than that but they don't really count
[37:33.720 --> 37:37.080]  because they're not gonna do anything with it so Nick is really the only
[37:37.080 --> 37:42.080]  person that's got the Pam 15 the s3s this is the only other pack that's up it
[37:42.640 --> 37:47.920]  is Pam 15 was my selection my personal selection out of the f2 generation there
[37:47.920 --> 37:52.240]  was a lot of plants in there and it was number friggin 15 ridiculous you know I
[37:52.240 --> 38:02.160]  mean I can't believe it but it is double the height and stretch of what Pam is it
[38:02.160 --> 38:10.480]  is an obnoxious plant to grow but it is so so worth what it puts on they it's
[38:10.480 --> 38:16.760]  like you know like super silver hazes any of like the old-school skunks the
[38:16.760 --> 38:20.840]  mass the mass skunks any of that type of stuff that heavy heavy stretching stuff
[38:20.840 --> 38:25.960]  this thing will will will outperform outstretch those things tenfold it's an
[38:25.960 --> 38:31.480]  insane stretcher it'll it'll triple you know it'll almost it'll triple in size
[38:31.480 --> 38:35.520]  once it starts going into stretch I've got a bunch of those in a greenhouse and
[38:35.520 --> 38:39.760]  every day I think hits the hits the top of the greenhouse it's a constant pain
[38:39.760 --> 38:44.160]  in the butt I cannot believe how it does its thing but unrestricted and
[38:44.160 --> 38:50.200]  loved or if just thrown in a in a in a room just on 1212 all the time or 11 11
[38:50.200 --> 38:56.880]  13 all the time from seed on or clone on the thing will fit in perfectly it has
[38:56.880 --> 39:05.280]  excellent spear haze tight buds that are not dense like Pam Pam is more dense and
[39:05.280 --> 39:11.960]  modern on the bud structure this is like more airy more old-fashioned
[39:11.960 --> 39:17.120]  traditional sativa a lot more like foxtailing and blowing up with those
[39:17.120 --> 39:22.480]  resin glands the resin glands or the calyxes are just huge they're enormous
[39:22.480 --> 39:28.200]  the resin on this thing doesn't start in as early as Pam like right when Pam
[39:28.200 --> 39:31.960]  number one started starts in on a resin right away it's like wow this thing is
[39:31.960 --> 39:38.720]  friggin gonna be greasy and nasty Pam 15 she waits for the for at least week
[39:38.720 --> 39:43.760]  three and as soon as that you know week three rolls right around it in all of a
[39:43.760 --> 39:48.240]  sudden she's greased out to every single fan leaf all of those families are these
[39:48.240 --> 39:53.720]  gigantically tall stocks and they cover every inch of every part of that plant
[39:53.720 --> 39:59.840]  even were anywhere near the the the bud it also has really really like no stock
[39:59.880 --> 40:03.320]  resin glands you know when you're looking at it up close and it's just
[40:03.320 --> 40:08.120]  packed in this beautiful beautiful forest but it's such an airy open bud
[40:08.120 --> 40:13.480]  it's like the perfect thing for washing or taking those resin glands right off
[40:13.480 --> 40:20.000]  of that SOB it's like a great hash making machine it is not racy but it is
[40:20.000 --> 40:24.760]  not couch locky it's it's more psychedelic when it comes to like
[40:24.760 --> 40:30.440]  experience it's very creative I guess is a better word it's more creative not
[40:30.440 --> 40:35.200]  gonna you're not gonna hallucinate but you are it's a time loss a time loss
[40:35.200 --> 40:37.840]  plant a good way to think about it too you like you get going on this weird
[40:37.840 --> 40:41.480]  project you start writing a friggin song or writing a book and all of a sudden
[40:41.480 --> 40:45.280]  seven hours have gone by you know four hours just gone by clock just is just
[40:45.280 --> 40:52.920]  it's just non-existent you know it is very very I can't stress enough like if
[40:52.920 --> 40:55.960]  you're gonna grow it in a small space you're gonna read be repotting the son
[40:55.960 --> 41:01.440]  of a bitch all the time it clones quick just like Pam it's got all those tough
[41:01.440 --> 41:07.920]  resistance factors because of its kind of open stacking nature you have that
[41:07.920 --> 41:12.640]  traditional sativa so it's gonna handle the the mildews and the molds and
[41:12.640 --> 41:15.720]  things it's gonna shed it right off you know those bud buds aren't gonna hold on
[41:15.720 --> 41:23.280]  to it as well it's not fluffy but it's not those rock-hard you know dog walker
[41:23.280 --> 41:28.320]  cookie nuts you know what I'm saying there's this is fine line and in my
[41:28.320 --> 41:35.320]  opinion it's it's extremely extremely beautiful to smoke with because it's not
[41:35.320 --> 41:38.640]  it's not a pain in the ass it doesn't break off the piece you can you can throw
[41:38.640 --> 41:42.960]  a I'm a pipe smoker you know bong smoker all that stuff for the most part and
[41:42.960 --> 41:48.240]  just you know the tear off bowls or wash the stuff is is is it smokes
[41:48.240 --> 41:56.160]  excellent flavor is like a lot of incense a lot of body odor a lot of
[41:56.160 --> 42:02.400]  kind of cinnamon sharper tones there there's kind of like cheesy cinnamon and
[42:02.400 --> 42:08.200]  like bad sharp body odor kind of kind of tone to it it's not like chem you know
[42:08.200 --> 42:14.440]  or it's not gas and it's not it's more incense than it is on in you know that
[42:14.440 --> 42:18.040]  if you walk into those old smoke shops you know and they just got all those
[42:18.040 --> 42:22.240]  incense burning and it's like you know somebody's wearing a funky ass perfume
[42:22.240 --> 42:26.360]  and somebody smoking a friggin cigarette in the back it's like all those all
[42:26.360 --> 42:31.320]  those smells you know what I mean together it's really funky you know
[42:31.320 --> 42:36.000]  awesome resin resin once it kicks in man it just like I said it just freakin
[42:36.000 --> 42:40.480]  drips over the thing and I don't know if they'll pop up or go through but
[42:40.480 --> 42:45.720]  there's man you if you if you don't get to see him here to go check out a pan 15
[42:45.720 --> 42:49.680]  just just hit a pan 15 pick and you'll get to see how pretty it is it's one of
[42:49.680 --> 42:52.960]  a one of a kind I mean you look at it and you're like wow that doesn't that
[42:52.960 --> 42:57.120]  really doesn't look like what I'm used to seeing you know what I mean it really
[42:57.120 --> 43:02.480]  does have something different to it it's got some swagger I go back and forth do
[43:02.480 --> 43:06.440]  I like pan 15 more do I like pan one more do I like pan 15 more do I like
[43:06.440 --> 43:10.800]  some days I some days Pam was my favorite some days Pam 15 is my favorite
[43:10.800 --> 43:19.200]  it's really really weird but it's way less fruity than Pam Pam's more that
[43:19.200 --> 43:25.560]  that great that blueberry that that something funk and in the like you said
[43:25.560 --> 43:30.680]  that's 15 is like that weird foreign smoke shop with all those funky smells
[43:30.680 --> 43:36.280]  in there you know what I mean tall crazy if you're an outdoor grower and
[43:36.280 --> 43:45.520]  you like growing trees man I guess the time over there I mean that but it is we
[43:45.520 --> 43:51.000]  got a winner it is it is a plant that's what I mean I don't know I don't know
[43:51.000 --> 43:55.160]  what I'm gonna end up doing with it but it's everything it touches it friggin
[43:55.160 --> 43:58.880]  throws it to the friggin ceiling man so I got this new stuff coming bacon grease

[44:03.920 --> 44:08.480]  drippy do-si-do resin mail it does you know 18 f2 so it's that cush dominant
[44:08.480 --> 44:12.880]  resin mail type and I mean it's got those cush it's a cushy mail man and I
[44:12.880 --> 44:20.200]  hit the pan 15 with that and that's box man those ones are coming out crazy but

[47:09.560 --> 47:16.280]  infatuation she named her so it's all good like yeah yeah so just a quick tip
[47:16.280 --> 47:19.600]  like the way the Pam got her name we didn't know what the hell she was she's
[47:19.600 --> 47:25.520]  a bag seed but when she was growing she had all this red lipstick on you know
[47:25.520 --> 47:33.000]  I mean it was yeah all this bright red lipstick she came from late 90s early
[47:33.000 --> 47:37.960]  you know 2000s bag seed that's the Baywatch period right where Pam
[47:37.960 --> 47:41.560]  Anderson was the queen of the 90s man like that that whole area that was the
[47:41.560 --> 47:46.240]  that was her reign in time right so my wife's like man that's Pam Anderson man
[47:46.240 --> 47:52.080]  she's oh my god I'm good with that let's let's roll I mean I'm nothing else but
[47:52.080 --> 47:58.560]  not you know it is what it is so it's it's she don't mind it's all good it's a
[47:58.560 --> 48:07.560]  good wife yeah okay so this is the next item you guys want to set a starting bid
[48:09.640 --> 48:15.760]  god man this is a friggin fire plant I don't you know I feel I feel guilty
[48:15.760 --> 48:20.920]  putting numbers on shit you know what I mean I really I really do Josh Josh
[48:20.920 --> 48:28.920]  somebody somebody pick Josh and Jessie or Kev what would you pay for this okay
[48:28.920 --> 48:36.920]  well let me tell you it was first it was a CSI a Caleb CSI a humble his TK his
[48:36.920 --> 48:43.800]  chem 91 you reverse the chem 91 put it on the TK create a gator bait that's
[48:43.800 --> 48:50.080]  what I've selected it from I got a bunch of the gator bait so love the chem love
[48:50.200 --> 48:54.360]  the try that's my dream that's what I want this is my project for the pan like
[48:54.360 --> 49:01.800]  I've been trying to put gas into that into that great bubblegum funk for so
[49:01.800 --> 49:07.080]  long she dominates the gas I mean she dominates everything so I would love to
[49:07.080 --> 49:15.040]  have that friggin that that big league to great nasty chem gas somehow combined
[49:15.040 --> 49:19.600]  in some way so this was my this was my project to do that I sought out that
[49:19.600 --> 49:26.360]  particular plant that chem 91 triangle Kush combination even though that can
[49:26.360 --> 49:30.960]  be in you know the the mail I kind of wanted it the other way around I wanted
[49:30.960 --> 49:36.280]  the I wanted to be triangle Kush on the chem 91 but either way it's friggin
[49:36.280 --> 49:40.920]  badass fucking plant right so out of the ones we got there was some friggin
[49:40.920 --> 49:44.700]  superstars in there there was a couple of funny little Hermes as you would
[49:44.700 --> 49:48.200]  expect with that with that with that line especially with the chem being there
[49:48.200 --> 49:55.280]  was but the plant that I pulled out of there was friggin greasy as shit and
[49:55.280 --> 50:01.000]  when you hit it in a joint from I mean to the last rip it tasted friggin
[50:01.000 --> 50:06.240]  delicious it was it was that gas that I was looking for it was that
[50:06.240 --> 50:13.480]  quintessential long lasting friggin triangle chem gas like perfectly united
[50:13.480 --> 50:18.360]  the plants you can see it they have that grease they've got that tight cheen
[50:18.360 --> 50:22.960]  or not you know there it's just it's just got that thing about it you know so
[50:22.960 --> 50:30.800]  I wore out before in the chat here just so I took that I took that plant that
[50:30.800 --> 50:36.080]  that hate son of a bitch to the last drop and I hit it to my to my Pam F to
[50:36.080 --> 50:40.000]  that was the one that made the BX that was the one that did a lot of the stuff
[50:40.000 --> 50:45.040]  that was my chosen guy that Pam F to hit that son that that gator bait and
[50:45.040 --> 50:50.680]  that became pandemic that happened right when the pandemic was happening unfolded
[50:50.680 --> 50:53.560]  and I'm like god damn this is the perfect friggin name in the whole world
[50:53.560 --> 50:56.720]  I can't believe somebody said it at one point I just started dying like this
[50:56.720 --> 51:09.960]  couldn't happen any better the timer started the bidding is on 420 we're I'm
[51:09.960 --> 51:13.880]  gonna give us three more minutes on this one we're at 420
[51:13.880 --> 51:18.360]  Neptune downs is the leader right now we're gonna give it three more minutes
[51:18.360 --> 51:28.720]  all right okay all right back on so early Greece happening testing is is
[51:28.720 --> 51:35.760]  awesome they are all they were not dominated by Pam in the structural
[51:35.760 --> 51:41.640]  standpoint which is a complete surprise complete surprise they still have that
[51:41.640 --> 51:47.080]  they still have a little stretch to them which is to be you know expected but the
[51:47.080 --> 51:57.000]  leaf shape was changed the stoutness was changed in there's early Greece so
[51:57.000 --> 52:01.800]  there's one that's about week four now during testing and I already know I
[52:01.800 --> 52:06.880]  already know it's it's gonna be fucking awesome it's it's got the sheen it's got
[52:06.880 --> 52:10.960]  the chem it's got this little chem nose but it's it's fruit dominant but it's
[52:10.960 --> 52:15.200]  got this it's got this something something extra on board and it's just
[52:15.200 --> 52:19.000]  developing to the point where you know it's it's got it's carrying it it's
[52:19.000 --> 52:24.360]  carrying it you know and then all the others are behind it but it's weak you
[52:24.360 --> 52:28.000]  know we not even week two I mean we're early we're just showing starting to
[52:28.000 --> 52:32.680]  show pom-poms you know and the leaves all around already got glitz on them the
[52:32.680 --> 52:36.320]  pom-poms are already kind of just a little bit a little bit darker a little
[52:36.320 --> 52:40.200]  bit more swaggery than usual and and like I said the grease is coming on
[52:40.200 --> 52:43.600]  super early and I love seeing that in plants I hate it when they when they
[52:43.600 --> 52:48.040]  hold off it really and it usually doesn't turn out good you know it
[52:48.040 --> 52:50.640]  usually doesn't turn out good if they're starting to glitz early and they're in
[52:50.640 --> 52:57.080]  there early and often I'm I'm always I'm always keeping a close watch but they
[52:57.080 --> 53:03.320]  this was the first time like I said that the structure wasn't dominated by by Pam
[53:03.320 --> 53:08.720]  so I'm really really really stoked on this this is something that I'm gonna
[53:08.720 --> 53:12.240]  I'm gonna work I pulled out a I pulled out two males out of the group they
[53:12.240 --> 53:19.040]  stink like like nobody's business they're more on like this sour it's kind
[53:19.040 --> 53:23.960]  of like sour like sharp lemon almost it's like but it's it's more soury and
[53:23.960 --> 53:29.960]  and like and triangle cush eat you know if that's it that's a word but it's got
[53:29.960 --> 53:33.720]  this it's got this sharp sharp little lemon note or something something in
[53:33.720 --> 53:38.400]  there too but both the males have that same type of chart profile they were the
[53:38.400 --> 53:44.040]  only two that that really reeked with something unusual like that so they got
[53:44.040 --> 53:49.040]  pulled aside they look good but I'm like I said this is this was my pet this was
[53:49.040 --> 53:52.560]  my goal I've been trying to do this for a long time I got my dog beach line with
[53:52.560 --> 53:59.880]  his dog walker in the Pam I've got OG cushions and Pam I've got weird old
[53:59.880 --> 54:04.280]  school shit anything that's carrying gas and skunk I've put with the Pam over the
[54:04.280 --> 54:09.760]  years trying to trying to infuse that infuse that thing and she's fucking
[54:09.760 --> 54:13.080]  dominated every one of them out of it and it's like it's hard to find but you
[54:13.080 --> 54:18.000]  always find these crazy beautiful beautiful combinations but it's like
[54:18.000 --> 54:22.800]  goddammit I just I want that I want that that chem fuel you know what I mean I
[54:22.800 --> 54:27.200]  wanted to come through strong and I think I'm positive almost positive that
[54:27.200 --> 54:32.280]  I got it I got it this time especially especially with those so that's something
[54:32.280 --> 54:37.040]  I'm real excited about that one in bacon grease or are gonna be my claim to fame
[54:37.040 --> 54:40.000]  this this coming season those are my two things I've really been working hard on
[54:40.000 --> 54:46.240]  and yeah so I wanted to put out some some pandemic before you know it got put
[54:46.240 --> 54:50.840]  out that way somebody could get a jump on it and I know just like the just just
[54:50.840 --> 54:54.360]  just like a few of the other things I know that as soon as it just gets on the
[54:54.360 --> 54:58.840]  on the table or in the ground it's it's gonna be around it's gonna be a wrap
[54:58.840 --> 55:02.000]  some people are gonna want to grow because of all those good trades from
[55:02.000 --> 55:07.240]  Pam and all the good traits from the classics can't go wrong man we got a
[55:07.240 --> 55:15.920]  winner on this one 460 to me jar jar bank I say that judge aura your wrath

[01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:16.860]  you can explain what that means oh easy I figured that you know if the royal cut that I got from
[01:00:16.860 --> 01:00:25.740]  the one that really forms the lineage from that point forward and I also got an og from him that
[01:00:25.740 --> 01:00:36.020]  he said was like the foundation that's actually the og that he was using a lot of his projects
[01:00:36.020 --> 01:00:43.380]  and that og I gave to a body and he pulled 14 to the Emerald Cup out of like 1100 entries that
[01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:51.220]  year with a pure og so it's the highest rank that ever got taken by a pure og kush and I got
[01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:58.620]  them both for a mandel you know back and back in the day but the og has been meristem scrub so it's
[01:00:58.620 --> 01:01:04.700]  like brand new and the royal is always cherry extreme resistance they seem always seem susceptible
[01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:10.220]  to me but it really is a stunner and instead of you know I want to do it in two two packs so you
[01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:14.620]  somebody gets one pack of rolling and og the other one gets a royal in an og so I wouldn't
[01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:18.260]  mind seeing both of these guys make the money I don't even know the other dude I know Brett for
[01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:23.100]  years and so me and Brett been friends for a long time and when I saw his holy shit burn down I was
[01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:29.820]  like fuck so I don't I don't want him having to say who gets to draw on it but I'll put I'll put
[01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:38.580]  four of them up and they're they're just really the they're the the source of those lines that
[01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:45.980]  og kush is fucking phenomenal it's like you walked into a hospital and took a deep breath it is that
[01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:53.620]  astringent and sharp in the nose it is just a plus I mean stunner so that's what we got
[01:01:53.620 --> 01:02:07.500]  yeah and that that that the royal that's the royal seven yeah well yeah he didn't he didn't
[01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:14.740]  call it the royal seven when I got it it was just his iteration of royal so I got it from him direct
[01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:23.260]  and he was like this is the one that I'm fucking with and then it was after he took off Leo gets
[01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:30.300]  involved in reading it and we're digging up the line and I had given a copy to a buddy in
[01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:36.540]  Sacramento so I had a buddy in sack that held it for me and happy hash Nick had a copy of it and
[01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:42.620]  you have guys meet happy hash Nick happy hash Nick was a dim and his brother had a spot over
[01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:49.900]  in like was that fucking not well it's um oh where's that as you coming through on the 101
[01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:57.580]  burger spot but they had a nice little dispensary a hoplin and they got screwed by a bigger
[01:02:57.580 --> 01:03:03.660]  dispensary that bought the build and then jacked up their rent like 10 times and so happy hash Nick
[01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:08.540]  and his brother had this killer spot over there but the kid was a really good hash maker and he
[01:03:08.540 --> 01:03:15.340]  he he was able to secure the cut and it slid in and that's where all that breeding started
[01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:22.060]  and so it was really when Leo started breeding the plant that that first designation came out
[01:03:22.060 --> 01:03:27.900]  when Mandel got out of the wherever he was hiding when he came back we put the plant back into his
[01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:34.620]  hands and I introduced them to Leo and so they started working on collaborative work from that
[01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:40.220]  point forward but the bottom line was at that time when I got the royal there was no fucking
[01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:47.660]  designator on it it was this is the royal it was the one that they had done the most work on it was
[01:03:47.660 --> 01:03:52.460]  the selection and I busted his balls till he fucking died that he they couldn't breed a better
[01:03:52.460 --> 01:03:58.700]  plant than that one because really it was just so unbelievably complete and he used to get all pissed
[01:03:58.700 --> 01:04:03.420]  off at me and shit to laughing about how his new works more dank but then we'd laugh and be like
[01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:10.620]  all right it's pretty fucking good so the the that royal cut is phenomenal and but it's the
[01:04:10.620 --> 01:04:16.940]  mother everything you see now that is in the royal fucking world that cut is the mother to the magnum
[01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:23.980]  opus so the magnum opus is that mom so all of these these these extremely well-known royal lines
[01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:30.540]  anything royal cut and connected tracks back to that one and the OG is super fucking natural and
[01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:37.740]  after I had a meristem scrub man it is it is back to like stunning the internodal spacing is so tight
[01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:44.140]  like once you scrub an OG it's amazing to really see how much OG is contaminated. Do we want to run
[01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:48.700]  do we want to run the two bids or do we want to take the top two bidders or?
[01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:54.300]  Any way you want to do it I just I just don't want to have to throw this to just one of the two guys
[01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:57.980]  like I said I love Brad man he's been a good friend to me for a long time and I think he just
[01:04:58.060 --> 01:05:02.780]  couldn't be a nicer guy and I don't even know the other dude but the other dude's life is the same
[01:05:02.780 --> 01:05:09.580]  he's he's a community member who got got burned out and you know they they both they both need to
[01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:15.740]  benefit from the charity and so you guys you know lay it out as you best choose and then I have
[01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:20.460]  the plants and the we'll just put the put me in touch with the winners. Where do we want to start
[01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:31.660]  what was so just to clarify that there are you have two uh royals and two OGs or sorry four of
[01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:38.860]  each so we can do you could do what you could do is you could you could set it up to where you have
[01:05:38.860 --> 01:05:47.980]  two winners and each one of the winners gets a a copy of both. And let's do that let's let's do
[01:05:48.780 --> 01:05:53.180]  once you once you find out who that person is just get me the email and I'll work it all out
[01:05:53.180 --> 01:05:59.260]  from there. Let's just do the top the top the top two bid winners the top two bid. Yeah because
[01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:04.300]  this way that we can it can be it can be spread and the beauty of this one is that like you know
[01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:09.500]  it's kind of like with like the Pam like I love Tyler talking about the Pam because I've heard
[01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:16.460]  about it in so many different ways now that it's just an appreciation for the time it took to hold
[01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:23.260]  it and and chase the quality and there's something about shit that other people worked and held for
[01:06:23.260 --> 01:06:28.620]  time that when you get to touch it and play with it too it's it's kind of like cutlery
[01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:36.300]  when you're holding handmade dives it's like you're holding the the the soul of the person
[01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:44.700]  that made it and so with those two plants those those were directly from Mandel to me so uh and
[01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:49.660]  at the time that OG was not getting shit the fuck out that OG held in check.
[01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:55.900]  It was it was an absolute money maker I mean it couldn't be any more it was just like walking in
[01:06:55.900 --> 01:07:02.380]  a hospital take a big deep breath and that that astringent sharp oh savage in the face.
[01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:08.220]  What uh so you guys set a price and figure it out let's chase it down and then just shoot me an
[01:07:08.220 --> 01:07:13.420]  email and what was priceless? Give give give me a start Kev I don't I hate I hate putting a start
[01:07:13.740 --> 01:07:17.900]  price like I'm you know I feel like I'm you know someone's feeling somewhere
[01:07:20.300 --> 01:07:24.380]  started it fucking 500 a block so this way it was like 250 for the clone
[01:07:25.180 --> 01:07:28.300]  you know what I mean because it's weird something that's reasonable like
[01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:37.340]  you're getting the real cuts but you're also getting a directly linked from the dude that's
[01:07:37.340 --> 01:07:44.780]  no longer live. And you get a little contact with Kev uh and he's pretty cool about uh
[01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:48.460]  talking with you and and sharing some information he'll probably spit back
[01:07:48.460 --> 01:07:51.900]  with you a little bit you know on that so that's pretty priceless.
[01:07:54.780 --> 01:08:00.220]  Um all right these guys are already throwing down 500 on it so let's start a timer um cool
[01:08:01.180 --> 01:08:07.740]  thanks Kev that's freaking awesome. No I think it'd be good. Hey I think we should give the
[01:08:07.740 --> 01:08:16.780]  timer a little bit longer on this one. Double it because like this will go this is gonna go.
[01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:25.260]  Is that the original like the original OG Kush that he brought in
[01:08:25.260 --> 01:08:29.260]  like that original plan or is it the plant that he worked out of that original
[01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:34.860]  stuff that you brought in for this? No it's it's the original plant he said to him it was the book
[01:08:34.860 --> 01:08:43.740]  end so in his opinion the Hollywood cut that I got was was the lime to him and this particular OG
[01:08:43.740 --> 01:08:49.260]  was the lemon and he believed if you had both of those book ends of OG there's nothing you
[01:08:49.260 --> 01:08:54.620]  couldn't make in the middle. So a tremendous amount of his hybridization work was banging
[01:08:54.620 --> 01:09:03.100]  into that OG and when I and when I got that OG I had um the the kid that I that was involved with
[01:09:03.100 --> 01:09:07.020]  Mac. Mac had brought in breeders from other parts of the country to work and there was a cat named
[01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:15.260]  Dave that worked with Mac and Dave was a fucking a glass collector where he had met on tour all the
[01:09:15.260 --> 01:09:22.540]  great glass artists in the world and this fucking dude was a glass broker when he wasn't growing
[01:09:22.540 --> 01:09:30.700]  super fire OG breeding super fire OG and he was probably one of the best home blowers of BHO
[01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:37.340]  I never fucking met like the kid was just really on point on his shit and Dave had a collection
[01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:43.500]  of glass that was fucking unreal because he was brokering all these 30 fucking 40,000 pieces
[01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:48.220]  because he could access it from the artists and then make money on the movement so when you went
[01:09:48.220 --> 01:09:52.780]  to his house there was a collection on the fucking wall and it was funny because he always had to
[01:09:52.780 --> 01:09:57.740]  have somebody in the crib because he had so much money in glass that he always had to have security
[01:09:57.740 --> 01:10:02.140]  at the house to keep somebody in the home so that nobody would break in and steal the fucking glass
[01:10:02.140 --> 01:10:10.300]  because it's art you know it's irreplaceable really and so he got brought in and when we turned that
[01:10:10.300 --> 01:10:17.100]  that OG this cut into into BHO it was some of the most ferocious clean it was it actually launched
[01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:25.180]  the oil cartel so I formed the oil cartel because I was so high on that oil that I was like I need
[01:10:25.180 --> 01:10:31.180]  to start my own fucking white label oil business and because at that time none of these guys wanted
[01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:36.860]  their name on any of the products because it was still that you know undercover time and I had a
[01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:42.620]  storefront so what I did is I created the humble oil cartel and we would mine the sands of the
[01:10:42.620 --> 01:10:48.540]  region to find the finest of oils and I was bringing in the nastiest shit I'd put it up
[01:10:48.540 --> 01:10:54.300]  against anybody's shit today man there was craft blowers at that time that were just absolutely
[01:10:54.300 --> 01:11:00.700]  fucking possessed with blowing good oil and that OG cut came out as the goldenest
[01:11:01.660 --> 01:11:08.300]  it was it gleamed like fucking gold I mean it was so unbelievable and the quality of the smoke was on
[01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:13.660]  and it had just such a stunning fucking visual appearance it was almost like
[01:11:13.660 --> 01:11:20.380]  it exploded from the inside out and the resin exploded from the ends of that so I mean it was
[01:11:20.380 --> 01:11:25.900]  fucking frosted you you got you got a hold of me man you need one yeah yeah yeah that
[01:11:25.900 --> 01:11:31.180]  motherfucker's it's the real deal dude it really is like so I've been you know actually through all
[01:11:31.180 --> 01:11:36.860]  the OGs and I fucking had a libraries of them and I've run them side by side and I've had them
[01:11:36.860 --> 01:11:44.060]  fucking DNA'd so like I know the population well enough to know that this is a really fucking good
[01:11:44.060 --> 01:11:51.820]  one and it's just beautiful and the thing is you know it takes you back to the era of what OG is
[01:11:51.820 --> 01:11:57.500]  and for a lot of people that are like my age that's really what they don't find is the is these
[01:11:57.500 --> 01:12:01.900]  things from the past that's what the Pam's interesting because it captures a time period
[01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:08.140]  when those type of strains were coming over and you still saw shit that was unique Himalayan herb
[01:12:08.140 --> 01:12:16.140]  Indian herb because heads are always moving shit around in small concentrations but the good OG
[01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:21.580]  that was just it checks every fucking box yeah that started everything man that's the she's
[01:12:21.580 --> 01:12:31.020]  nasty one man she's a nasty one and I and yeah yeah she nasty I was gonna say on the Royal
[01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:39.740]  is that the same one that I got a copy of a few years back Kev yeah for me yeah yeah yeah I am
[01:12:39.740 --> 01:12:45.100]  I have I don't hold the cut anymore but I hold on to it for two years ish and I dumped some
[01:12:45.100 --> 01:12:51.340]  pollen on it last year and threw them in the in the greenhouse and they are by far the most resin
[01:12:51.340 --> 01:12:57.420]  coated plants I have in the entire garden yeah she's stunning it's like like when you see the
[01:12:57.420 --> 01:13:01.900]  purple punch and you're like that's fucking you know just look so coated that's it's like that
[01:13:02.780 --> 01:13:07.980]  you know beyond what the cut the cut the cut the cut was in my garden it just like excelled you
[01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:13.180]  know going you know getting at that extra generation I want to say there's a dude in Oregon
[01:13:13.180 --> 01:13:19.580]  pulling seven points on the turps we've hit over we've hit we've hit like 29 30 with it right in
[01:13:19.580 --> 01:13:25.900]  that high 29 range in terms of potency so the numbers are current it's I mean that's what made
[01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:32.860]  that that breeding job so interesting was that he he built a package that really is current today
[01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:41.020]  because so much of today is numerics and it's nice when it's awesome and it has fucking numerics
[01:13:41.020 --> 01:13:46.540]  like the numerics matter on the sale in the stores and I see all these these you know
[01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:52.380]  surveys where people prefer low potency weed and they want low potency weed and I'm just like
[01:13:52.860 --> 01:13:59.340]  kind of the the numbers still really have a real mental quantification with individuals
[01:13:59.340 --> 01:14:05.020]  they perceive it to be that it's the same reason why you buy a fucking 1000 cc bike instead of a
[01:14:05.020 --> 01:14:15.260]  750 it it goes a little quicker not much but it they they move different and that royal has
[01:14:15.260 --> 01:14:20.140]  those numbers which blew my mind that's just it's so fucking solid and that's what Nick used to do
[01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:28.060]  all his healing and I I took my entire outdoor crop of it a couple years like two years ago
[01:14:28.060 --> 01:14:35.660]  I grew my California six and I ended up turn it all into a FICO for a friend of mine who ended
[01:14:35.660 --> 01:14:41.980]  up passing away but he was taking it in a suppository form and I mean a tremendous amount
[01:14:41.980 --> 01:14:47.340]  of it man like I was I gave him fucking peanut butter jars of the shit trying to fight it back
[01:14:47.340 --> 01:14:53.100]  and it was really doing a good job but we couldn't keep the supply stable enough through
[01:14:53.100 --> 01:15:00.460]  the whole process his consumption was so strong that I I gave him all I had and there was no more
[01:15:00.460 --> 01:15:07.260]  and then we I was sourcing products trying to help him out but his his his uh colon uh cancer
[01:15:07.260 --> 01:15:15.180]  was so aggressive and so fucking ferocious that it ended up killing him but the the RSO the FICO
[01:15:15.180 --> 01:15:23.020]  you know made from that royal absolutely gave him a little bit more time and he was a really
[01:15:23.020 --> 01:15:29.740]  really nice man his name was Cam Estrada a really fucking good dude out of Seattle and
[01:15:31.020 --> 01:15:36.860]  that that that royal had a tremendous impact on that on that period where he was able to have that
[01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:43.100]  fall of my harvest where he was able to use that harvest the whole time through a multiple month
[01:15:43.100 --> 01:15:48.300]  period which let him get off the opiates from all the other drugs he was on because the opiates
[01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:57.100]  were what was really fucking him up the most and so Rizdan Rizdan finds out about um terpenes and
[01:15:57.100 --> 01:16:03.020]  resistance to the fungal issues he comes out and gets he comes out and gets a copy of this thing
[01:16:03.020 --> 01:16:09.900]  and he was able to utilize it to really start to kind of pave a new way in holistic medicine mindset
[01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:18.540]  where people who are using cannabis in that form as antifungals so you know it's it's a it's a
[01:16:18.540 --> 01:16:24.460]  phenomenal plant for for for so many purposes that it's just really if anybody who wants to get in
[01:16:24.460 --> 01:16:30.540]  resistance is incredible that shit'll finish in fucking bad weather it'll nug up beautifully
[01:16:30.540 --> 01:16:35.180]  it kills it indoor if you want to run it in a depth you got to veg it a little bit bigger
[01:16:35.260 --> 01:16:39.980]  it's it's a true outdoor plant where it's it's opposite of the pam it doesn't have uh
[01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:47.740]  accelerated fucking growth early fills in nicely um food hungry thing is if you can always see one
[01:16:47.740 --> 01:16:53.020]  in the greenhouse because it's always the palest plant because it wants to fucking eat so she just
[01:16:53.020 --> 01:16:58.300]  really really the a beautiful example and i and that's the one i've always talked about for years
[01:16:58.300 --> 01:17:05.180]  which to me really exemplifies mac anderson was that that was the selection made and when i met
[01:17:05.180 --> 01:17:10.140]  him that was what was putting his name on the fucking map before all this other shit that
[01:17:10.140 --> 01:17:15.820]  came down later and the breeding stories and all the things it was the fact that he and him his crew
[01:17:15.820 --> 01:17:21.900]  and team had come up with that cut and they were moving that to the cultivators and i was picking
[01:17:21.900 --> 01:17:28.060]  those up in trays from him and and growing them on my outside projects because that stuff was just
[01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:34.060]  bulletproof the color comes out stunning it would be nice with the pam because it it has same
[01:17:34.060 --> 01:17:38.860]  beautiful colorations within it just really interesting fuchsias and the hues are gorgeous
[01:17:40.300 --> 01:17:45.580]  yeah nick's gonna do that i'm sure i'm sure he's gonna that's you know that's his baby
[01:17:45.580 --> 01:17:50.620]  is that royal yeah what are the dominant turps yeah that's what i was gonna ask good question
[01:17:50.620 --> 01:17:57.020]  thank you that's to me to me it's got a musky floral over a dirty earth
[01:17:58.860 --> 01:18:07.420]  and so it's it's i want to say intoxicating like a good bag of royal when you open it up and get a
[01:18:07.420 --> 01:18:14.300]  smell on it man it it fills your face with this beautiful complexity from the perp lines so they
[01:18:14.380 --> 01:18:24.780]  use that mendo perp and that has that that that depth in it of fruit but suddenly huge fruit so
[01:18:24.780 --> 01:18:30.300]  that there's complexity in the bouquet and then there was that dirty earth coming out of that
[01:18:30.300 --> 01:18:37.420]  highland and had that sour and so it has this rich full fucking flavor and the smell is just
[01:18:37.420 --> 01:18:43.420]  pulsating when people smell it they're like oh my god this is exotic as shit and for that time
[01:18:43.420 --> 01:18:48.140]  it was really interesting because he was calling it royal kush right and we're growing og kush like
[01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:55.180]  you wouldn't fucking believe so kush is pumping and humble at that time and my buddy casey who
[01:18:55.180 --> 01:19:01.580]  is one of the owners of bare extracts in arcada he was the first person that said hey look i got i
[01:19:01.580 --> 01:19:06.060]  got some i got some royal out of my depth and i was like oh i heard about this is that from that
[01:19:06.060 --> 01:19:12.300]  kid mandel and he was like yeah he goes taste this shit it's fucking rich and it was really nice
[01:19:12.300 --> 01:19:20.140]  because you had to push that earthy push back but in the front of it had that intoxicating mouth
[01:19:20.140 --> 01:19:26.220]  and nose that just brought you into it and the i want to say that he's saying there's like osmium
[01:19:26.220 --> 01:19:31.340]  but in the terp test but you know the thing is you can influence terp profiles depending on how you
[01:19:31.340 --> 01:19:36.940]  grow it like terp profiles to me don't really if someone who chased that shit as much as i chased
[01:19:36.940 --> 01:19:41.580]  it it really doesn't mean a whole fucking hell of a lot unless it's repeated meaning that like
[01:19:42.060 --> 01:19:48.700]  you're running a baseline at a location and then you are you're comparing what the terp profiles
[01:19:48.700 --> 01:19:54.460]  are revealing to you in your perception so you can kind of understand where you're moving something
[01:19:55.100 --> 01:20:00.220]  but when you're comparing them apples to apples it's okay but when we start to change locations
[01:20:00.220 --> 01:20:07.340]  or situations that they can the numbers can vary wildly and the ratios and concentrations can vary
[01:20:07.900 --> 01:20:14.060]  and what you end up having is a similar perception just suddenly different so to me the chemical
[01:20:14.060 --> 01:20:20.700]  complexity of the way we perceive terpenes and and and flavonoids is so fucking complex
[01:20:21.820 --> 01:20:26.460]  that you basically just have to accept the fact that the machine isn't giving you the information
[01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:33.980]  you need as much as you would like to say it does it's super so true man like the pam exactly she
[01:20:33.980 --> 01:20:39.340]  she flip-flops all over the place on turf they move it's it's it's insane it's insane you can
[01:20:39.340 --> 01:20:43.580]  see the levels rise with the right stress because like i said there's a guy in oregon
[01:20:43.580 --> 01:20:49.500]  that that runs the same cut and i'm telling you he's pulling like over seven on the terp analysis
[01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:55.740]  i want to see which is phenomenal you know oh it's a beautiful beautiful plant i love it because it's
[01:20:55.740 --> 01:21:01.980]  so resistant it makes it easy for individuals who want to cultivate it holds itself up well
[01:21:02.060 --> 01:21:07.980]  outdoor it doesn't shed branches i hate that shit you know what i mean you you select you
[01:21:07.980 --> 01:21:12.700]  you know you know i'm saying you select for outdoor subject i needed to i needed to have
[01:21:12.700 --> 01:21:18.540]  knuckles i wanted to be able basically like be a big a better framed better flavored very white
[01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:22.700]  because very white could go through a fucking tornado and no branches would come off
[01:21:23.660 --> 01:21:28.060]  i think they're literally welded they're welded to that fucking main stem you know what i'm saying
[01:21:28.620 --> 01:21:34.220]  yeah that primary branch and you got the extra ring got that extra fucking ball
[01:21:35.900 --> 01:21:41.900]  forever you know what i mean you i love that that's the stuff you have to have for outdoor this
[01:21:41.900 --> 01:21:46.380]  cajun this shit is ridiculous it means that you're structurally fucking inadequate
[01:21:47.020 --> 01:21:50.940]  and that that should not be part of the selection process for outdoor dope if you haven't
[01:21:51.900 --> 01:21:56.300]  the thing has to fucking hold itself up and then there's a point where you have to mechanically
[01:21:56.300 --> 01:22:01.100]  support anything because it's so fucking big because outdoor it would have just fallen over
[01:22:01.100 --> 01:22:06.060]  and then dug into the earth adventitiously rooted and then thrown branches up at that
[01:22:06.060 --> 01:22:10.460]  new fucking angle because it doesn't give a shit it just wants to be powerful
[01:22:12.460 --> 01:22:19.420]  but you know for our purposes we need something that holds a nice beautiful shape and so anything
[01:22:19.420 --> 01:22:24.940]  that you tap into it it brings that beautiful musky flavor it dominates it's it's um
[01:22:26.700 --> 01:22:31.180]  it's something that's really nice i think to work and breed with because it just like your
[01:22:31.180 --> 01:22:37.180]  pam when you use it it's consistent in what it does and with the royal hybrids no matter what
[01:22:37.180 --> 01:22:44.940]  male you blow into this thing it it throws that musky flavor it puts a better resistance and it
[01:22:44.940 --> 01:22:52.140]  adds that that deep there's like a rich green that almost reminds me of like amphibian green
[01:22:52.140 --> 01:22:58.700]  and under that amphibian green is that that fuchsia hue so as the as the anthocyanin starts
[01:22:58.700 --> 01:23:03.180]  to really come out is that that chlorophyll pigment dissipates through the the season
[01:23:03.820 --> 01:23:10.940]  the colorations are just fucking stunning so like it's just really quality and all the attributes
[01:23:10.940 --> 01:23:17.260]  you want is like a foundation plant to work with and that og is really the same where it's like if
[01:23:17.260 --> 01:23:22.540]  you're looking for fucking a plus og kush that there's nobody on the fucking planet that wouldn't
[01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:28.300]  smoke a joint of that shit and say damn that's some sharp-ass og you know those that's what you
[01:23:28.300 --> 01:23:32.540]  need that's what people need from plants is they got to have a couple of things in their library
[01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:42.300]  that just work for them where this is something that was proven and the the the the ability to
[01:23:42.380 --> 01:23:47.500]  get it through known lineage and then also to know that it was touching somebody it's if you like
[01:23:48.220 --> 01:23:54.140]  you know in the like howard marx right howard marx was this legendary dude out of london that
[01:23:54.140 --> 01:24:01.420]  was moving all the hash and his name was mr nice so mr nice seed bank all these main companies
[01:24:01.420 --> 01:24:07.500]  howard marx was like the money behind that and he was a g and my buddy over in london phil um
[01:24:08.220 --> 01:24:14.140]  rolled with howard for fucking ever right and he was just talking always about you know what a good
[01:24:14.140 --> 01:24:18.540]  dude howard was and then i got to talk to some of howard's buddies because he could
[01:24:18.540 --> 01:24:23.980]  tied me into howard's crew and i got to talk to him about genetics and shit we were just laughing about
[01:24:25.660 --> 01:24:33.180]  having things that howard had touched because this fucking guy was fucking ginormous
[01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:39.340]  and his selection what he liked to burn what you know and and it his and his friends were
[01:24:39.340 --> 01:24:44.300]  talking about how they held some of these things and it just was an emotional connection because
[01:24:44.300 --> 01:24:48.460]  it was it was something that was selected by someone who knew what the fuck they were doing
[01:24:48.460 --> 01:24:54.780]  which helps because now you know it's at least good and it has a history and a lineage it's like
[01:24:54.780 --> 01:25:00.620]  james dean's porsche you know there's a lot of old porsches but the one that james dean owned
[01:25:01.260 --> 01:25:07.100]  seems to have more value and and that's really how i think people need to see it is that it lets
[01:25:07.100 --> 01:25:12.860]  them tie into the past that lets them get into the the one of the top ogs it's the top og ever
[01:25:12.860 --> 01:25:17.820]  to touch the emerald cup no og ever fucking laid it down my dude came over to me he's like yeah
[01:25:17.820 --> 01:25:23.660]  because i just pulled fucking like 14 out of 1100 with that car i said nice i said you got a bag
[01:25:24.220 --> 01:25:33.580]  you bag of that weed and it's it's um it's just things that i think that for people if you wanted
[01:25:33.580 --> 01:25:38.780]  two really beautiful directions one of them the fruit the fruit always is more sedative
[01:25:39.340 --> 01:25:44.380]  in the sense that typically fruit like tangy uplifts you but when you have a musky fruit with
[01:25:44.380 --> 01:25:49.980]  an earthy back it's got a fuller smoke and so you get the fruit flavor but you don't get that
[01:25:50.780 --> 01:25:58.140]  racy quick high i'm done it it settles into a deeper longer body high but that those first
[01:25:58.140 --> 01:26:05.660]  hits from the that floral bouquet open you up and so it's a really different direction than the
[01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:11.180]  straight og and the straight og straight og man it fucking opens your eyes and then wipes your ass
[01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:19.580]  so it lets you take you know two cornerstones of of what's hot and it's going to be hot until we're
[01:26:19.580 --> 01:26:24.940]  all old because the truth is that good stuff is good stuff you know your grandmother's heirloom
[01:26:24.940 --> 01:26:29.100]  rose was your grandmother's heirloom rose you still like smelling it today i don't and i go
[01:26:29.100 --> 01:26:35.100]  and i go look at flower farms and i'm like as awesome as all the new shit is it's still just
[01:26:36.140 --> 01:26:41.980]  awesome shit so stuff from the past that was cracking it will always find a way to live
[01:26:42.860 --> 01:26:48.940]  yeah yeah yep yep and then he was made the selection and we keep pushing and moving and i
[01:26:48.940 --> 01:26:54.380]  held on under these for all these years myself and it was a fucking reason like i didn't let go
[01:26:54.380 --> 01:27:02.940]  of them for a reason so it'll be a really good addition to someone's library that'll let them
[01:27:02.940 --> 01:27:11.660]  have two real things that were absolutely quality and two radically different directions in what you
[01:27:11.660 --> 01:27:17.980]  do the breed because one of them is a squat solid bush and the other one is ojikush but it's a
[01:27:17.980 --> 01:27:24.460]  meristem dojikush so it has way better branching radically different rooting like just better
[01:27:27.020 --> 01:27:33.020]  oh man once you once you scrub some of these older plants like you get to see what they look
[01:27:33.020 --> 01:27:38.540]  like when you first met them because like we're older so we've been playing with this shit for a
[01:27:38.540 --> 01:27:45.340]  while right you look at things and you go whoa am i not as good as i used to be or is the plant
[01:27:45.340 --> 01:27:51.340]  not the same fucking plant and so you always take it that you're not as good as you used to be so
[01:27:51.340 --> 01:27:56.460]  you're always like trying to refine your technique and skill to make things happen but you get to a
[01:27:56.460 --> 01:28:00.620]  point where you realize like wait a minute my memory can't be fucking wrong i have the data
[01:28:00.620 --> 01:28:05.020]  something's different and what you found is that we just had picked up too much viral package
[01:28:05.820 --> 01:28:09.420]  and there was just too much different baggage on these plants and being able to get rid of it and
[01:28:09.420 --> 01:28:15.660]  scrub it and it lets you see it in it's just in its growth pattern its root ability and it just
[01:28:15.660 --> 01:28:22.060]  allows people to get stuff that's clean and then go start their you know their own collection
[01:28:22.780 --> 01:28:27.740]  because you you have to hold if i just had a couple of plants you know three four of them
[01:28:28.700 --> 01:28:35.260]  basically and i was forced to have those in living form everything else in seed having a royal and
[01:28:35.260 --> 01:28:39.580]  that og would be in that package because i could put the royal out anywhere i fucking lived and i'd
[01:28:39.580 --> 01:28:44.860]  be able to pull herb because it finishes in it finished it can take the weather you don't know
[01:28:44.860 --> 01:28:51.500]  i mean like it's really a that that that coastal selection and the fact that he was doing all that
[01:28:51.500 --> 01:28:57.660]  work in arcada and at the time arcada was still really foggy so humble changed climate over over
[01:28:57.660 --> 01:29:04.940]  these years but arcada that coastal area was always foggy and so all the grows always had
[01:29:06.940 --> 01:29:12.700]  moisture issues so you had to be really cautious with pm and the royal did not have any of those
[01:29:12.700 --> 01:29:17.580]  issues and so you could go into these in these warehouse grows i was looking at and fucking
[01:29:17.580 --> 01:29:23.260]  house you know gutted houses and shit and these things were just glistening with with no
[01:29:24.220 --> 01:29:30.140]  assistance so it allows people to be able to put a tent and grow plants in a tent and not worry about
[01:29:30.140 --> 01:29:35.340]  it rotting it lets them put it out in fucked up climates and they don't have to worry about rotting
[01:29:35.340 --> 01:29:43.260]  you know it it allows you to get a harvest of some really good herb though like the the herb that
[01:29:43.260 --> 01:29:49.420]  comes with that plant is excellent so the chemovar and the cultivar matched see me remember we had
[01:29:49.420 --> 01:29:55.100]  that discussion with ethan russo a couple a couple uh like podcasts back with pita when
[01:29:55.100 --> 01:30:01.260]  ethan russo was on and we were rapping about i do yeah you remember that one and um me and me and
[01:30:01.260 --> 01:30:05.660]  ethan were going to get together and have a conversation or he said hey let's get together
[01:30:05.660 --> 01:30:11.180]  some time and do like a uh you know an online discussion of we'll call it the chemovar meets
[01:30:11.180 --> 01:30:17.500]  the cultivar because ethan's about the chemovar and the chemistry and and how that works and
[01:30:17.500 --> 01:30:25.820]  functions and i've historically chased cultivar first with chemovar on top of it because if the
[01:30:25.820 --> 01:30:32.540]  plant doesn't have growability it won't be grown so you can't move plants into the system that
[01:30:32.540 --> 01:30:37.900]  don't fucking root i don't care how good the herb is if you can't plug that shit if the if the if
[01:30:37.900 --> 01:30:43.900]  the average person can't root it that stuff will not move through the system at a speed great
[01:30:43.900 --> 01:30:50.940]  enough to really become a trend you can't create a trend through your production you it has to move
[01:30:50.940 --> 01:30:56.940]  out of your hands it fucking has to move like a virus into the system where many people are making
[01:30:56.940 --> 01:31:03.740]  money on not just growing the herb and selling the herb but but the plants and and the ability
[01:31:03.740 --> 01:31:11.340]  for the plant to root and be able to to transfer to the next individual is key to me in in how
[01:31:11.340 --> 01:31:17.180]  things move as as varieties and so things that are fungally weak and prone they don't get
[01:31:17.180 --> 01:31:22.300]  replicated things that don't root they don't get replicated and so you have to have stuff that
[01:31:22.300 --> 01:31:26.700]  works you're going to have indoor shit that can handle the indoor fucking fluctuations
[01:31:26.700 --> 01:31:31.500]  you're going to have debt plants that jump you're going to have outdoors that are bulletproof and so
[01:31:31.500 --> 01:31:37.260]  i chase those things because i've always provided plants to people to make money with and so we all
[01:31:37.340 --> 01:31:42.780]  know the heady shit and we hold that in like little form but when you're talking about creating
[01:31:42.780 --> 01:31:49.740]  a fucking big block of grass the cultivar has to work and so me and ethan we're going to get
[01:31:49.740 --> 01:31:55.180]  together and bang on this one about how what we like and and how they how they have to meld because
[01:31:55.180 --> 01:32:01.500]  we think there's gene linkage with when you change one factor morphologically you change something
[01:32:01.500 --> 01:32:08.140]  else in the chemotype because of linkage drag and so it's not so simple to put it all together and
[01:32:08.140 --> 01:32:17.020]  it's it's easier to get chemotype laid out than it is to get morphology laid out so that that royal
[01:32:17.020 --> 01:32:22.460]  is just such an un-fucking-believably good plant for anyone who wants to grow good grass anywhere
[01:32:22.460 --> 01:32:28.300]  in the united states anywhere in the fucking world and she just does well you know october first
[01:32:28.300 --> 01:32:36.620]  finish resistant beautiful coloration full musky fills the whole field stinks in your yard musky
[01:32:36.620 --> 01:32:44.700]  sexy deep deep rich holds it through the season too if you um you put it away correctly man that
[01:32:44.700 --> 01:32:49.420]  shit you break it out you know six months later it still reeks i mean it's just really really a
[01:32:50.140 --> 01:32:51.420]  fantastic cultivar
[01:32:54.140 --> 01:32:57.740]  it's gotta be able to finish man kevin you you sold me
[01:33:01.340 --> 01:33:10.140]  i want it so we actually so we have two winners uh we have brandon uh who is making a payment to
[01:33:10.220 --> 01:33:13.740]  brett and uh who is the other winner
[01:33:15.980 --> 01:33:24.380]  someone shredder yeah shredder to uh sean so sean if you can let us know
[01:33:27.100 --> 01:33:34.780]  nothing yet okay uh so why don't we uh we have mr bob hemphill in the house and
[01:33:34.940 --> 01:33:44.940]  the final on that uh yeah what what'd they go for yeah 880 880 and 875 beautiful beautiful
[01:33:45.580 --> 01:33:51.820]  thanks kevin and thank you so much for the donation because the you know if you haven't
[01:33:51.820 --> 01:33:57.260]  met brett man he's like the nicest fucking guy ever like you know what i mean like i call him
[01:33:58.140 --> 01:34:05.500]  brett right because me and brett came out with uh uh like depth comp competitions at the exact
[01:34:05.500 --> 01:34:11.420]  same time without knowing each other and without stealing each other's idea we had like fucking
[01:34:11.420 --> 01:34:18.780]  mutual spark of genius on one day and so we both we both meet he's like dude i'm cali debt press
[01:34:18.780 --> 01:34:25.660]  wet i'm like oh fucking golden top cat and we were dying because we had both wanted to highlight
[01:34:25.660 --> 01:34:32.140]  that craft in our areas and so he and i become good friends and he was just such a nice fucking
[01:34:32.140 --> 01:34:37.660]  dude and i and i i don't get to see him as much as i used to because the way the industry changed
[01:34:37.660 --> 01:34:42.140]  where he was one of the seed brokers that used to bring all the killer seed stock in from a lot of
[01:34:42.140 --> 01:34:48.220]  the breeders and so brett you know brett knows the game and he's a phenomenal cultivator and
[01:34:48.220 --> 01:34:53.420]  couldn't be a nicer fucking human being and i see the picture on ig and it's it's basically you know
[01:34:53.420 --> 01:35:00.060]  the the ashes around fucking your frying pans in your house in that seed collection oh my god
[01:35:00.620 --> 01:35:07.100]  oh fuck no you know like yeah oh my god and you know you're grateful you know you're alive but
[01:35:08.620 --> 01:35:13.820]  that's some really really deep shit you know like you lose everything in a fire and a flood and like
[01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:18.620]  people can steal from you but like that shit takes everything they didn't they don't even
[01:35:18.620 --> 01:35:24.140]  leave the box the shit came in and so i i was i didn't know what to i'd go through this stuff
[01:35:24.140 --> 01:35:27.900]  and i've been busy at work and i i figured you know those are two things that i know will drive
[01:35:27.900 --> 01:35:34.380]  some value and um that's what thank you for putting this together you know the community
[01:35:34.380 --> 01:35:42.140]  the community is a community and you you have to be able to to rally together when people have need
[01:35:42.140 --> 01:35:48.860]  this genuine and hopefully down the road when our lives are better again we'll all re-appreciate
[01:35:48.860 --> 01:35:53.020]  what that's like and we'll get to be able to look back and say you know what even when the
[01:35:53.020 --> 01:35:58.700]  fucking world was melting down reefer people was still doing good things for people whether they
[01:35:58.700 --> 01:36:04.940]  knew me or not speaking of community um thank you kev like thank you for the connection it's amazing
[01:36:04.940 --> 01:36:12.460]  and thank you for the the golden tarp awards and thank you brett for the the depth fest like the i

[01:37:14.220 --> 01:37:21.020]  love easy all right so mr bob hemp hill this all goes downhill if we can't hear your audio so let's
[01:37:21.900 --> 01:37:29.660]  let's hear those baritone pipes how are you doing all right fuck yeah it works all right so let me
[01:37:29.660 --> 01:37:35.820]  so you i i couldn't tell if you sent like 52 different items or if you just sent like the
[01:37:35.820 --> 01:37:45.180]  same four or five but a bunch of times so i have like i just picked four uh so we have
[01:37:45.660 --> 01:37:53.180]  tell me where you want to start vintage pakistani open pollination shire haze tie
[01:37:55.180 --> 01:38:04.140]  afghan wait sorry yeah pakistani and then afghani and then uh the northbound the train
[01:38:04.140 --> 01:38:10.860]  wreck and the northern lights so which one do you want to start with let's start off with the
[01:38:10.860 --> 01:38:18.070]  let's start off with the vintage packing all right you want to tell us about it
[01:38:19.350 --> 01:38:28.310]  yeah this is a line that was originally released by bode and when i was living in santa cruz at
[01:38:28.310 --> 01:38:38.310]  the time i was interested in pakistani lines and i knew brett kelly debt fest had some seeds he had
[01:38:39.190 --> 01:38:48.070]  a 20 pack and i got to contact bode and bode had a 20 pack left but that was the last of the seeds
[01:38:48.070 --> 01:38:57.430]  he had so i arranged to get both packs to open pollinate them and i did an open pollination
[01:38:57.430 --> 01:39:06.790]  in the full sun um 100 organic in santa cruz and gave seeds back to bread and back to bode and
[01:39:07.430 --> 01:39:14.710]  and never released it i've just done it in charity auctions and it's an amazing breeding tool
[01:39:15.510 --> 01:39:24.630]  it's a short squat indica sativa hybrid mostly indica um the reason i say it's a hybrid is
[01:39:24.630 --> 01:39:30.950]  because it's just got a lot of really rich sativa turps i feel like a lot of the pakistani lines have
[01:39:31.830 --> 01:39:37.430]  a lot of sativa influence that gives them a lot of interesting terpenes it has
[01:39:38.710 --> 01:39:48.230]  grape it has chemical cleaners it has earthy tones and it's amazing breeding stock and
[01:39:49.030 --> 01:39:55.990]  let let me just jump in for a second what what while he's describing it with such
[01:39:56.070 --> 01:39:59.270]  lovely adjectives uh what do we want to start the bidding at
[01:40:01.270 --> 01:40:13.060]  don't don't everybody be shy josh jesse why tyler why why don't you propose
[01:40:13.060 --> 01:40:21.620]  an opening bid price for this one all right uh no bode release i'd say uh
[01:40:22.420 --> 01:40:30.580]  i'd say i'd start it i mean it's a legend i mean it's his selection i i don't know i
[01:40:30.580 --> 01:40:35.860]  i don't want to be uh i'd say i say 200 bucks we start this puppy at 200 bucks
[01:40:37.540 --> 01:40:43.700]  it's a pure it's a vintage pakistani open pollination it's got all of the breeding
[01:40:44.180 --> 01:40:49.620]  tools you need if you're trying to like build a plant this has got all of those
[01:40:49.620 --> 01:40:55.540]  it's not an isolated you know characteristic so you've got a lot of cool stuff bode has had his
[01:40:55.540 --> 01:41:04.420]  hand in it and and and mr bob so i i yeah open pollination vintage pakistani 200 bucks man
[01:41:05.860 --> 01:41:14.790]  and that's low they've definitely gone for higher every other time i've auctioned
[01:41:15.190 --> 01:41:21.750]  it's an amazing breeding tool and yeah i think i think the bidding's already blown
[01:41:21.750 --> 01:41:26.470]  past the opening price so that's you gotta get the ball rolling you know
[01:41:28.230 --> 01:41:35.830]  you know how to set excitement i'm telling you i it's if you want to craft it i mean that's that's
[01:41:35.830 --> 01:41:39.830]  i mean just just the people alone you gotta look at the plants that were involved that
[01:41:39.990 --> 01:41:44.390]  just the people alone you gotta look at the plants that were involved that that alone is worth you
[01:41:44.390 --> 01:41:50.390]  know more than the 200 bucks so i mean the pakistani is the bonus you know and then and
[01:41:50.390 --> 01:41:55.590]  it's open pollination so for me i you know i'd get in trouble if i opened up my wallet my wife
[01:41:55.590 --> 01:42:00.390]  would kill me if i walked in she's like hey yeah i went in there with money i came out with with
[01:42:00.390 --> 01:42:09.350]  nothing so i'm dying here those royals that you know but this is it man this just you know the
[01:42:09.350 --> 01:42:31.770]  names alone is worth that all right what are we at right now what's the flower time on those
[01:42:31.770 --> 01:42:37.930]  we got a 310 from sunnyland right now like what's like average like uh
[01:42:38.970 --> 01:42:44.170]  like they're fast they're about eight weeks they're really fast outside yeah
[01:42:45.850 --> 01:42:51.530]  they have good low branching are they are they good squat branches or are they are they tall or
[01:42:51.850 --> 01:43:00.410]  what's their they've got they got really nice uh um branching really tight inner nodes really
[01:43:00.410 --> 01:43:07.930]  strong branches um they have a decent amount of stretch on them they're not a complete squat plant
[01:43:07.930 --> 01:43:15.130]  um but they have that nice squat plant structure that comes from that region what are your what
[01:43:15.130 --> 01:43:19.690]  are your favorite uh what's your favorite tone to pull out of there what's your like what was
[01:43:19.690 --> 01:43:31.450]  what's your favorite um some grape and um chemical cleaners on um you know yeah so it's
[01:43:32.810 --> 01:43:50.340]  it's really terpene rich and just quickly kind of in terms first of all where are you based are
[01:43:50.340 --> 01:43:56.980]  you in northern california or oregon or yeah i'm in um humboldt oh you're in humboldt okay
[01:44:00.180 --> 01:44:06.980]  but this uh was done a couple years ago when i was in santa cruz and in terms of your breeding
[01:44:06.980 --> 01:44:13.540]  do you have like something you focus on like i mean you you donated a bunch of stuff is there
[01:44:13.540 --> 01:44:22.660]  like a commonality or um so i focus on preservation of old land race strains and um clones i've been
[01:44:22.660 --> 01:44:29.780]  collecting clones for 25 years and have held on to some of them successfully as long as 20 years
[01:44:29.860 --> 01:44:39.460]  and i try try to use pure stock um either hair loom or land race uh strains to cross into those
[01:44:39.460 --> 01:44:46.580]  uh clones and i like to match uh the same type of thing to keep it as pure as possible and
[01:44:47.460 --> 01:44:51.540]  try to keep the seed stock as pure as possible so that way it's really good breeding stock
[01:44:52.500 --> 01:44:59.410]  librarian work it's amazing to hold something that long
[01:45:01.890 --> 01:45:10.050]  yeah i think back and then i'm like it's uh it's amazing i don't know if i got another 20 years on
[01:45:10.050 --> 01:45:20.420]  me to be honest holding all these strands this long it's a lot of work the moves are really the
[01:45:20.740 --> 01:45:27.540]  crazy part i move like a gypsy yeah the moving part oh my god it's always such a nightmare for
[01:45:27.540 --> 01:45:33.380]  you look i couldn't imagine yeah i'm fucking rolled through utah and fucking nevada with
[01:45:33.380 --> 01:45:37.460]  fucking more plants than anyone in the state back in the day that's that's what makes it
[01:45:37.460 --> 01:45:43.220]  really impressive you know the moving you know it's insane yeah that's truly the insane part
[01:45:43.860 --> 01:45:50.420]  you need to hit up the beach next time you're down here yeah i was actually uh down there at
[01:45:50.420 --> 01:45:56.340]  the beaches in trinidad today i was at baker beach i'll definitely hit you up next time
[01:46:03.410 --> 01:46:10.610]  people were definitely uh letting it live up to its nickname a nudie beach so oh yeah baker yeah
[01:46:10.770 --> 01:46:19.210]  baker yeah how was it i was actually up in the hills today i was out at moon maid checking out
[01:46:19.210 --> 01:46:25.130]  a bunch of the cherry lime uh or the cherry moon it's like a cherry lime dog bc1 f2 version of the
[01:46:26.090 --> 01:46:32.250]  uh of that lime pop cross oh my god they're so good that that's tina you're at tina's farm
[01:46:32.250 --> 01:46:39.930]  yeah yeah yeah i i love i love her weed oh my god yeah it's gonna be so insane this year too
[01:46:40.810 --> 01:46:43.610]  the orange valley dog and the sapphire suit just they all look amazing
[01:46:44.890 --> 01:46:53.930]  and uh crystal basically only grows your seeds right your genetics yeah um although this year
[01:46:53.930 --> 01:46:59.850]  too like some of the crosses that she made with them too she's growing on the uh there as well
[01:46:59.850 --> 01:47:09.530]  but this year there's athena dog and cherry lime dog and um uh there's a citron sfb cross and um
[01:47:10.250 --> 01:47:15.930]  a couple other really cool ones i thought i i thought like i thought it'd be cool to have you
[01:47:15.930 --> 01:47:22.090]  and her and maybe even someone else who grows out your genetics in conversation like in different
[01:47:22.090 --> 01:47:29.450]  climates like she she's like dry farming right so like dry farming at all yeah so then find like an
[01:47:29.450 --> 01:47:34.490]  indoor hydro grower who's running your stuff i mean or just someone in a different environment
[01:47:34.650 --> 01:47:42.010]  talk about it but anyway all right so who um i love pot absolutely stole that one at 350
[01:47:42.570 --> 01:47:52.330]  okay everybody was sleeping on that one uh so all right and that was i think brett's turn
[01:47:54.330 --> 01:47:59.530]  okay so let's go on second one was brett third one was sean then we did both so this one would
[01:47:59.530 --> 01:48:12.370]  be brett okay so and that was who i love pot underscore omyz at 350.
[01:48:16.170 --> 01:48:22.410]  all right so bob what do you want to do next so yeah bob we've uh we've been going back and forth
[01:48:22.410 --> 01:48:36.090]  between uh brett and sean um and our options um awesome cool so so all right so we have uh
[01:48:38.410 --> 01:48:46.500]  that's the one we just did right the vintage pecky is that the one we just did
[01:48:47.060 --> 01:48:57.620]  yep or that yeah okay so do you want to do the shire the afghani sure um do the shire by the a5
[01:48:57.620 --> 01:49:08.260]  haze tie the shires super silver sour diesel um sour diesel crossed by super silver haze
[01:49:09.380 --> 01:49:15.060]  um it got the name shire in upstate new york where it's a very coveted clone and
[01:49:15.140 --> 01:49:20.660]  clone and the people that are used to smoking it up there don't want to smoke anything else
[01:49:21.540 --> 01:49:28.740]  um on her own she takes about 100 to 120 days to flower um one of the finest clones i have in the
[01:49:28.740 --> 01:49:34.660]  collection if you like a sativa when i was in santa cruz i smoked her with a bunch of all timers
[01:49:34.660 --> 01:49:43.940]  um kq included and um jr and um they all said that it reminded them of the old school haze
[01:49:43.940 --> 01:49:52.100]  um it's got a little bit of the you know um flavor from the
[01:49:54.580 --> 01:50:02.820]  c5 you know the terpeneline and uh um but it also carries a lot of the the flavors um
[01:50:04.020 --> 01:50:11.460]  like the a5 is known for the leather leather and the metallic flavor and then um i combine that
[01:50:11.460 --> 01:50:21.220]  clone with the male that bode selected out of karma's breeding he matched the a5 haze clone that
[01:50:22.340 --> 01:50:33.460]  neville selected in 1985 it's nl5 nl5 crossed by um a the haze male a and then um
[01:50:33.460 --> 01:50:43.380]  um karma genetics took that old clone and he hit it with a um tie and then bode got one pack and
[01:50:44.740 --> 01:50:51.460]  he popped it and he got one male and um you know bode at supernatural selections
[01:50:52.180 --> 01:51:00.580]  it was the male he used to hit the cuban black haze with that made the band-aid haze um
[01:51:01.060 --> 01:51:05.700]  bode was generous enough to share it with several people in the industry doc d
[01:51:07.300 --> 01:51:14.820]  um et and myself all got to use it on different clones i never released them
[01:51:17.060 --> 01:51:22.260]  um kept them for private breeding stock and this is one of the most special ones
[01:51:23.300 --> 01:51:32.540]  out of all of them for sure and what what are we starting that one at
[01:51:32.620 --> 01:51:40.480]  100 bucks i think we should just keep them all at two but okay let's keep them at two
[01:51:41.280 --> 01:51:46.160]  it's definitely worth two um there wasn't many released at all so
[01:51:48.720 --> 01:51:51.900]  did we lose josh
[01:51:54.060 --> 01:52:00.700]  i've never gotta try the a5 man it's one of my here it's one of my plants i want i've always wanted
[01:52:01.580 --> 01:52:10.860]  the a5 is amazing i i guess i i've been stuck piling that all this stuff like i you know when
[01:52:10.860 --> 01:52:17.580]  you sent stuff over to me i just i pull like kind of two out of each and i'm like that's going for
[01:52:17.580 --> 01:52:25.740]  the for my own personal you know so i've always seen amazing stuff from you like it's you just
[01:52:25.740 --> 01:52:30.540]  you hold on to the special things like nobody else may be on the planet it's uh
[01:52:31.260 --> 01:52:36.140]  in your eye for things like yeah thank you for the work you do it's insane
[01:52:37.980 --> 01:52:42.540]  yeah i just uh selfishly want to keep the best stuff around i smoke it all the time so
[01:52:46.460 --> 01:52:51.340]  what what are these flower at if the shire is in 120 days what are these flowering out at
[01:52:52.220 --> 01:53:00.300]  most of them come down a little bit in time the um the a5 haze tie uh that male when i flowered him
[01:53:00.300 --> 01:53:06.700]  um i thought he was going to take a lot longer to set um bud set and but he didn't he he set pretty
[01:53:07.740 --> 01:53:15.980]  hard and fast and um it's 20 the male was 25 northern lights it was the famous nl5 clone
[01:53:15.980 --> 01:53:23.340]  that neville worked with so these generally flower at about 10 weeks 70 to 77 days
[01:53:24.620 --> 01:53:29.260]  that shit's right there man that's right where the best shit lays my opinion
[01:53:32.300 --> 01:53:37.500]  you look like you've smoked a little weed since we started i always look like this
[01:53:39.420 --> 01:53:44.540]  you have a big shit eating grin on your face that's i'm happy man there's no you know they're
[01:53:44.540 --> 01:53:49.500]  all good days you know some are better than others but shit you know that's what's my
[01:53:50.700 --> 01:53:57.580]  i live in socal it's 72 and sunny every day i got i got i got a few more minutes away from

[01:54:44.860 --> 01:54:56.380]  over here again right now we're we're trying to replant but the local sheriff's department
[01:54:56.380 --> 01:55:03.900]  has been using the opportunity of our gates being cut to kind of harass everybody and you know so
[01:55:05.820 --> 01:55:09.980]  i think we're i don't know we're just kind of taking it as a sign that it's probably time to
[01:55:09.980 --> 01:55:17.500]  move on so yeah i don't know we've been looking around we're just kind of just trying to stay
[01:55:17.500 --> 01:55:28.220]  positive we'll find something you know it's just uh we i mean i don't know it's kind of hard to say
[01:55:28.220 --> 01:55:41.100]  right now just kind of speculating yeah it's kind of fucked up by the way who's crickets am i hearing

[01:56:07.740 --> 01:56:11.820]  she recognizes his voice if he gets on a speaker or whatever she like
[01:56:12.220 --> 01:56:13.980]  she gets in the mode she's ready to go
[01:56:15.820 --> 01:56:23.570]  okay so we have we're at sorry what'd you guys say someone said 300 but it's way higher than
[01:56:23.570 --> 01:56:34.120]  that right now right i was a clown so where are we at
[01:56:35.880 --> 01:56:39.860]  it's not 300 right now with 30 seconds to go

[01:58:20.600 --> 01:58:29.000]  uh so this one's going to brett so who wants to hype this up and talk about how amazing these
[01:58:29.960 --> 01:58:36.840]  seeds are and the plants that will sprout from it no one's probably seen this one this is a very uh
[01:58:36.840 --> 01:58:43.960]  this one's kept tight it was a uh limited release it's uh the arcada trainwreck cut
[01:58:43.960 --> 01:58:52.280]  by northern lights number one um very strong pinene terpeneline with a
[01:58:52.600 --> 01:59:02.760]  um very strong pinene terpeneline with a strong frame very fast fast flowering
[01:59:13.620 --> 01:59:18.740]  you've got a lot sorry i was like thinking about it i'm remembering the old trainwreck and
[01:59:21.460 --> 01:59:27.940]  you've grown several of these out oh yeah definitely these are uh solid and um
[01:59:28.580 --> 01:59:33.460]  you know that's one of the longest uh cuts i've been keeping i've had that one around since uh
[01:59:35.460 --> 01:59:41.110]  99 yeah wow what do we start this one
[01:59:43.590 --> 01:59:57.930]  two yeah let's keep it at two so yeah the the the north northern lights number one it's about
[01:59:57.930 --> 02:00:03.690]  um as good of an outcross malice you can get do any kind of breeding work um
[02:00:05.850 --> 02:00:09.930]  if you know you want some pine this would be an amazing
[02:00:12.010 --> 02:00:17.210]  uh males to use out of this and if you like the old trainwreck and
[02:00:18.490 --> 02:00:21.290]  you want to get something similar to it this is uh
[02:00:23.370 --> 02:00:27.930]  the nl1 male really let the female shine through and quite a few of the
[02:00:28.810 --> 02:00:33.770]  large percentage of the seeds so i was thinking about i was just going to ask like with that
[02:00:33.770 --> 02:00:40.090]  northern lights male like you're matching it up just like to just make it super consistent
[02:00:40.090 --> 02:00:46.170]  coming out this trainwreck um i wouldn't say all exactly but you can definitely find the
[02:00:46.170 --> 02:00:51.850]  the trainwreck you know that's very similar and um they got bigger blood structure and
[02:00:53.290 --> 02:01:01.290]  much uh stronger frame you know trainer was really wimpy what's the seed size teeny yeah
[02:01:02.090 --> 02:01:05.610]  always so small like yeah i was curious if that carried over yeah
[02:01:06.250 --> 02:01:10.010]  i thought that nl1 might carry a bigger seed and um
[02:01:12.330 --> 02:01:17.290]  it didn't it's routine and yeah you're gonna get a bunch of them in there that's for sure
[02:01:17.290 --> 02:01:24.010]  just dark lemons dark dark as can be and the little teeny things that are so small you're like
[02:01:24.010 --> 02:01:31.530]  holy shit that's the one yeah you know yeah that's how trainwreck puts them out
[02:01:34.090 --> 02:01:43.050]  yeah it's a very special plant for sure so the same one it's 1999 yeah yeah
[02:01:43.610 --> 02:01:50.730]  yeah that is uh just like running like a fast forward movie of that like
[02:01:52.250 --> 02:01:58.250]  concept of you having that plan every place that it was and every clone and everything that was
[02:01:58.250 --> 02:02:04.970]  done and every like bit of nutrition and care and like you know new like it's it's a crazy thing to
[02:02:05.210 --> 02:02:07.690]  it's a crazy thing to think of that movie and fast forward
[02:02:09.770 --> 02:02:14.810]  it's it's uh there's been a quite an adventure let's just say that
[02:02:19.090 --> 02:02:22.930]  is your dream just to get like a big fucking greenhouse so you can just like
[02:02:22.930 --> 02:02:30.690]  plant and just keep in badge constantly oh my god that would that would make my life so easy
[02:02:30.690 --> 02:02:37.570]  but like i said yeah i live like a gypsy so um yeah i've had i've been like that a few times
[02:02:39.730 --> 02:02:44.690]  you know that they've seen a lot of different bedrooms that's for sure
[02:02:50.710 --> 02:02:52.870]  someone said they like the graphics on the packs
[02:02:55.670 --> 02:02:57.910]  and where were the crickets coming from though in the audio
[02:02:58.870 --> 02:03:06.790]  i don't know the crickets and we're like hearing it's part of the uh actually no i'm sorry it's
[02:03:06.790 --> 02:03:12.790]  actually my they're coming from outside my house i took my earbuds

[02:03:21.430 --> 02:03:29.980]  so then after this um
[02:03:32.140 --> 02:03:35.900]  actually let me make sure yeah because i pinged uh
[02:03:39.100 --> 02:03:51.980]  hold on emerald mountain to come on i don't know if he uh still went to went to bed or

[02:04:27.570 --> 02:04:29.570]  zoom speak up but uh
[02:04:31.570 --> 02:04:37.770]  a good one i mean what's the uh time on this one
[02:04:39.770 --> 02:04:48.570]  one minute to go it's a 56 uh day it's a solid eight weeks yeah that's the nice thing about it
[02:04:48.570 --> 02:04:55.770]  is super fast there's so much yeah it was like first first thing i remember smoking coming to
[02:04:56.410 --> 02:05:03.130]  first thing i remember smoking coming to arcada too in like 97 90 like just yeah everyone was
[02:05:03.130 --> 02:05:08.810]  really excited about it and i had this such this uplifting like euphoric and fun high
[02:05:11.050 --> 02:05:17.930]  yeah when i um first got it back in the day it was like you know everybody wanted train wreck and
[02:05:17.930 --> 02:05:26.970]  then um quickly after that it turned to purple and then it turned to og but um back in the day
[02:05:26.970 --> 02:05:32.090]  it was like humboldt's first elite like you know back and before that everyone just had humble
[02:05:32.090 --> 02:05:37.370]  bud and it was anything but this was the first clone that really circulated around that was like
[02:05:37.370 --> 02:05:48.560]  the one that everyone had to have that's right we got some snipe action coming in yeah josh is your
[02:05:48.560 --> 02:05:58.010]  instagram dutch bloom or or with an s on the end with an s uh michelle i don't know why i said that

[02:06:08.250 --> 02:06:12.890]  someone asked a question uh michelle p said how tall does it get
[02:06:13.370 --> 02:06:24.410]  um it even full season it stays uh you know relatively small about 10 feet and it doesn't go crazy
[02:06:27.130 --> 02:06:38.780]  inside it's very manageable does it do the like kind of like umbrella out like bush style or
[02:06:38.860 --> 02:06:43.740]  style or it does a christmas tree structure christmas tree oh cool
[02:06:44.940 --> 02:06:49.740]  yeah with the one very large butt on the center if it's on top yeah yeah
[02:06:52.860 --> 02:06:59.580]  so wait did we end with k robotacio at 310 that's what i'm saying
[02:07:01.660 --> 02:07:05.340]  yeah we did we skip the afghani everybody's asking about the afghani too
[02:07:05.500 --> 02:07:12.460]  i thought we did that no no we did the parky i thought we went for oh right right i thought
[02:07:12.460 --> 02:07:16.300]  we went from that to the afghani we did not all right so that that is uh
[02:07:17.980 --> 02:07:24.060]  all right give me a second so k rob k dot
[02:07:24.140 --> 02:07:25.500]  k dot
[02:07:28.860 --> 02:07:39.100]  yeah trying to youtube usernames um email me all right let me queue up the afghani
[02:07:43.300 --> 02:07:44.740]  oh there it is all right
[02:07:47.700 --> 02:07:54.420]  so mr bob hemphill take it away sell us on the afghani okay this is um
[02:07:55.380 --> 02:08:02.020]  originally released in small quantities i think it was five or ten packs by uh dave from gold
[02:08:02.020 --> 02:08:12.750]  coast genetics um i was lucky enough to get one of those original packs it was gifted to me
[02:08:13.390 --> 02:08:21.070]  from peabod mike and i did an open pollination and it was amazing um and then
[02:08:21.070 --> 02:08:27.630]  dave ended up donating another pack to a charity auction to raise money for his father
[02:08:27.630 --> 02:08:35.310]  that had cancer and that's where the seed stock originally came from it was um his father hooked
[02:08:35.310 --> 02:08:41.390]  him up with the the seeds i think there was his father's friend seed stock and their 80s um
[02:08:42.510 --> 02:08:48.510]  brotherhood of eternal love import um
[02:08:48.670 --> 02:09:00.830]  import um and yeah i bought that pack for uh like 575 i think and an auction to um
[02:09:01.550 --> 02:09:07.950]  get money back to dave's dad to help for the cancer bills and and i open pollinated it and
[02:09:07.950 --> 02:09:17.150]  i told dave i was gonna give him some and um he was like let's do a collaborative release and
[02:09:17.150 --> 02:09:24.270]  released 100 packs and i did 50 and he did 50 and they went really fast and um
[02:09:26.510 --> 02:09:34.430]  it's i've run through a lot of afghani lines and it's in my top three it's one of uh my favorite
[02:09:34.430 --> 02:09:44.590]  afghani lines it has all the qualities that you'd want in afghani um earthy flavor a grapey flavor
[02:09:44.590 --> 02:09:52.270]  and some of them um kind of incensy and others uh has an amazing structure really strong branches
[02:09:53.470 --> 02:10:02.510]  about 20 percent turn purple um outcrossed um you know i did some outcrosses with it
[02:10:03.310 --> 02:10:11.630]  and they've turned out amazing um i found keepers dave used it um himself as a breeding tool

[02:14:54.220 --> 02:15:02.220]  of afghani stock that kev sent me and they're just just now triggering um they're the last
[02:15:02.220 --> 02:15:10.860]  to trigger in my garden um and i have i've had like the hindu um balk mazari shimtral

[02:15:22.700 --> 02:15:29.420]  classic afghani yeah i'm surprised that they're taking so long uh to be honest but you know maybe
[02:15:29.420 --> 02:15:32.700]  it's just because of the cold weather i don't know that they're just getting kind of fucked up
[02:15:32.700 --> 02:15:38.140]  because it's so cold up here where i'm where i am you know yeah for sure i don't know the background
[02:15:38.140 --> 02:15:43.980]  on his stock but um when i'm talking and looking for afghanis i want something that's old school
[02:15:44.780 --> 02:15:50.220]  my stuff nowadays has been polluted um that's one of the best things about this line it was
[02:15:51.580 --> 02:15:59.180]  um mid 80s import so um it was back when the lines were a lot purer and all my favorite
[02:15:59.260 --> 02:16:05.820]  afghanis are old old like that i haven't been able to find anything that new that's uh comparable
[02:16:07.420 --> 02:16:28.580]  yeah where are we at cascadian

[02:17:57.880 --> 02:18:04.280]  and that was for the uh northbound train and right now we're on the afghani
[02:18:04.280 --> 02:18:09.080]  which every right now just went for 500 for sean
[02:18:09.640 --> 02:18:33.260]  sheldon sink won it with 500 okay so are we calling it at five wait five 500
[02:18:34.780 --> 02:18:45.100]  ezekiel wants to know can anyone fill me in about this pacific northwest hash plant
[02:18:46.780 --> 02:18:56.420]  so we're talking about uh with kaya so it's a old clone only from the pacific northwest
[02:18:56.660 --> 02:19:03.300]  i've tried to trace its heritage back to figure out if it's the exact same
[02:19:03.860 --> 02:19:08.260]  clone as neville worked with um because it came from the same region
[02:19:10.820 --> 02:19:16.740]  and it's just untraceable at that point um it's provenance got lost at some point
[02:19:17.540 --> 02:19:21.140]  but it's a really short uh branchy
[02:19:22.100 --> 02:19:29.780]  um indica from old clone only um that's you know i can trace back to the 80s
[02:19:32.500 --> 02:19:40.900]  it's very similar to the the puck the skelly hash plant and um any old scentsy seed banks
[02:19:40.900 --> 02:19:48.980]  hash plan i've seen so you know it really might be the same one but there's no telling um
[02:19:49.780 --> 02:19:59.300]  no telling um it's the same one that um bodie's worked with csi's worked with it um
[02:20:00.740 --> 02:20:17.560]  archive i think it's a it's a real good classic gem who won the uh
[02:20:20.120 --> 02:20:26.920]  the shire uh a5 haze i got a whole paper i'm gonna send you right now
[02:20:27.560 --> 02:20:33.160]  okay it's making me feel good that you're taking diligent notes and

[02:24:59.450 --> 02:25:01.650]  at a couple of farms and driving everywhere.
[02:25:04.800 --> 02:25:06.240]  All right, while you're telling jokes,
[02:25:06.240 --> 02:25:08.080]  just give me one second.
[02:25:11.080 --> 02:25:12.440]  I'm almost there.

[02:25:24.830 --> 02:25:26.710]  All right, do you wanna do
[02:25:31.070 --> 02:25:34.670]  the Mean Gene collab, cherry lime dog,
[02:25:34.670 --> 02:25:37.170]  or do you wanna start with the banana dog?
[02:25:39.150 --> 02:25:41.430]  Which one do you wanna do first?
[02:25:41.430 --> 02:25:43.470]  Let's do banana dog and gut it up, yeah.
[02:25:45.390 --> 02:25:48.950]  So this is a, yeah, 100 pack.
[02:25:48.950 --> 02:25:51.790]  I just figured just, and.
[02:25:51.790 --> 02:25:53.030]  Go big.
[02:25:53.030 --> 02:25:55.190]  Go big, you know, some farmers out there,
[02:25:55.190 --> 02:25:57.590]  you know, need to be able to like do a bunch of something
[02:25:57.590 --> 02:25:59.630]  that's super consistent.
[02:25:59.630 --> 02:26:03.350]  These are very consistent, incredibly solid.
[02:26:03.350 --> 02:26:06.070]  You're not gonna see any issues, no herms,
[02:26:06.070 --> 02:26:07.790]  no giant variation.
[02:26:07.790 --> 02:26:10.310]  They're just gonna chunk out like crazy.
[02:26:10.310 --> 02:26:12.230]  You can use them for whatever you want.
[02:26:12.230 --> 02:26:14.190]  Like, they'll be fantastic for flowers,
[02:26:14.190 --> 02:26:16.310]  but they yield crazy in ice water hash
[02:26:16.310 --> 02:26:17.550]  if you wanna freeze them.
[02:26:18.510 --> 02:26:20.710]  You know, it's got the perfect combination
[02:26:20.710 --> 02:26:22.750]  of black dog and banana chirps.
[02:26:22.750 --> 02:26:26.510]  You got that like berry and banana and the gas
[02:26:26.510 --> 02:26:28.990]  and like, yeah, it's just all around.
[02:26:28.990 --> 02:26:32.830]  I have some friends farm depping like a bunch right now
[02:26:32.830 --> 02:26:34.390]  and it's just like flawless.
[02:26:34.390 --> 02:26:37.230]  They're just like blown away by the production
[02:26:37.230 --> 02:26:38.910]  and the stability.
[02:26:38.910 --> 02:26:42.550]  So this is just like, you know, this is a farmer pack.
[02:26:42.550 --> 02:26:45.870]  This is fucking fill your, fill the field
[02:26:45.870 --> 02:26:47.710]  and it'll be consistent and chunky.
[02:26:49.590 --> 02:26:50.430]  Wow.
[02:26:51.990 --> 02:26:52.830]  It's amazing.
[02:26:58.070 --> 02:26:59.430]  I think.
[02:26:59.430 --> 02:27:01.870]  I'm gonna give this one a 10 minute timer
[02:27:01.870 --> 02:27:03.430]  just cause it's a hundred pack.
[02:27:03.430 --> 02:27:04.270]  Yeah.
[02:27:05.310 --> 02:27:07.710]  Just settle on a starting number.
[02:27:09.630 --> 02:27:10.750]  Start at four.
[02:27:14.250 --> 02:27:16.290]  That sounds like a good round number.
[02:27:16.290 --> 02:27:17.970]  That sounds pretty cheap.
[02:27:17.970 --> 02:27:18.810]  I'm just saying.
[02:27:22.730 --> 02:27:23.570]  That's amazing.
[02:27:23.570 --> 02:27:24.410]  Thank you, Jesse.
[02:27:24.410 --> 02:27:27.010]  That's an amazing, that's crazy.

[02:28:33.360 --> 02:28:34.680]  There's only thing that's hit.
[02:28:34.680 --> 02:28:36.200]  Oh, the other ones haven't gone through yet.
[02:28:36.200 --> 02:28:37.280]  Yeah.
[02:28:37.280 --> 02:28:41.360]  But do you see like transactions initiated or not at all?
[02:28:41.360 --> 02:28:43.240]  Yeah, I see the very first one.
[02:28:43.240 --> 02:28:45.040]  There's a transaction of 420.
[02:28:48.660 --> 02:28:50.060]  Theo Gallagher.
[02:28:50.060 --> 02:28:50.900]  Yeah.
[02:28:51.900 --> 02:28:55.900]  From Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts.
[02:29:01.680 --> 02:29:06.680]  I hope a Patriots, Bruins, Red Sox, and Celtics fan.
[02:29:16.560 --> 02:29:17.400]  Did we lose?
[02:29:17.400 --> 02:29:18.240]  Oh, wait.
[02:29:19.240 --> 02:29:24.240]  Josh, why don't you tell us how amazing Jesse is?
[02:29:25.240 --> 02:29:30.240]  Well, are we talking about this genetics
[02:29:30.240 --> 02:29:32.120]  or just about Jesse in general?
[02:29:32.120 --> 02:29:33.440]  I don't know.
[02:29:35.920 --> 02:29:37.720]  You can start with either one.
[02:29:37.720 --> 02:29:40.440]  You have eight minutes left.
[02:29:41.880 --> 02:29:45.320]  I was actually thinking about this today
[02:29:45.320 --> 02:29:47.600]  because one of the big things that I've known
[02:29:47.600 --> 02:29:51.080]  that Jesse has been doing for the last handful of years
[02:29:51.080 --> 02:29:52.640]  is the Regeneros app.
[02:29:52.680 --> 02:29:57.160]  Handful of years is the regenerative cannabis farm award,
[02:29:58.960 --> 02:30:00.600]  which happens at the Emerald Cup.
[02:30:00.600 --> 02:30:05.600]  And also the display that goes on with it.
[02:30:08.680 --> 02:30:10.960]  The award and the judging that they created,
[02:30:10.960 --> 02:30:13.480]  which is really beautiful,
[02:30:13.480 --> 02:30:15.840]  but then they create this huge display
[02:30:15.840 --> 02:30:18.360]  and the teaching and speakers and stuff.
[02:30:18.360 --> 02:30:20.560]  So I was just kind of curious.
[02:30:20.560 --> 02:30:22.520]  I mean, I know it's obviously a huge bummer,
[02:30:23.400 --> 02:30:25.920]  but just what you guys had going on with that
[02:30:25.920 --> 02:30:29.760]  and how you guys were gonna do something
[02:30:29.760 --> 02:30:32.000]  or what you guys were thinking.
[02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:34.400]  Yeah, it's kind of unknown what's happening
[02:30:34.400 --> 02:30:36.240]  with events right now, right?
[02:30:36.240 --> 02:30:37.080]  Right.
[02:30:37.080 --> 02:30:40.200]  But I think in the spring, some online stuff,
[02:30:40.200 --> 02:30:44.160]  but yeah, there's a lot to still figure out on that.
[02:30:44.160 --> 02:30:47.000]  It's sad not to be setting it all up.
[02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:51.320]  It was really fun curating all the speakers last year
[02:30:51.320 --> 02:30:55.280]  and the regenerative agriculture garden exhibit
[02:30:55.280 --> 02:30:57.560]  looked amazing last year.
[02:30:57.560 --> 02:30:59.040]  Just so many people come together.
[02:30:59.040 --> 02:31:04.040]  It was like Moon Valley, Eli comes down
[02:31:04.160 --> 02:31:06.400]  and like, or Moon Valley Organics, sorry.
[02:31:06.400 --> 02:31:08.680]  And brings like all these materials
[02:31:08.680 --> 02:31:11.600]  so we can build like the cross section of a hugelculture
[02:31:11.600 --> 02:31:13.560]  so people can understand what we're talking about
[02:31:13.560 --> 02:31:17.760]  with that like rainwater catchment models
[02:31:17.760 --> 02:31:19.560]  from high tide permaculture.
[02:31:19.600 --> 02:31:24.600]  And we had amazing KNF that our friend Jim put together,
[02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:26.920]  like just so many cool things.
[02:31:27.840 --> 02:31:31.800]  Just hands-on getting to hear about the ingredients,
[02:31:31.800 --> 02:31:33.000]  how to actually do things.
[02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:35.680]  It wasn't just like displays.
[02:31:35.680 --> 02:31:38.360]  It was like people there showing you how to do it,
[02:31:38.360 --> 02:31:39.200]  hands in the dirt.
[02:31:39.200 --> 02:31:42.000]  And then we had a whole bunch of talks
[02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:45.640]  all throughout the weekend, amazing breeder panels
[02:31:45.640 --> 02:31:48.400]  and a lot of people coming on too.
[02:31:50.040 --> 02:31:52.400]  We had one that was on regenerative farming,
[02:31:52.400 --> 02:31:54.200]  which was pretty cool to have like,
[02:31:55.240 --> 02:31:57.880]  we had Heart Rock who, yeah,
[02:31:57.880 --> 02:31:59.720]  I think there's some cool donations
[02:31:59.720 --> 02:32:04.720]  to come in with the Lion Claw auto flowers,
[02:32:05.120 --> 02:32:09.680]  but we had a Green Source Gardens and Sunroots Farms,
[02:32:09.680 --> 02:32:14.680]  Sunbowl, Sunshine, and yeah,
[02:32:15.080 --> 02:32:17.720]  just super cool groups of people.
[02:32:17.720 --> 02:32:22.720]  We had CSI and Jason Equilibrium
[02:32:23.160 --> 02:32:25.760]  and we had Jackson and all kinds, yeah.
[02:32:25.760 --> 02:32:28.560]  It was just super fun weekend to be able to like
[02:32:28.560 --> 02:32:31.680]  bring all of these permaculture ideas
[02:32:31.680 --> 02:32:34.600]  and then also all the cannabis genetic stuff together too.
[02:32:37.520 --> 02:32:39.840]  Can you elaborate on the genetics here for the banana dog?
[02:32:39.840 --> 02:32:41.560]  We got a lot of people asking questions.
[02:32:41.560 --> 02:32:44.160]  Oh yeah, it's banana OG and it's black dog.
[02:32:44.560 --> 02:32:47.960]  It's yeah, it's like the class of banana OG,
[02:32:49.680 --> 02:32:54.000]  yeah, Oregon Kid and actually Mr. Bob Hemphill
[02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:57.800]  is been a steward of that one for a long time too,
[02:32:57.800 --> 02:33:01.720]  that particular selection and yeah,
[02:33:01.720 --> 02:33:06.720]  just yeah, the black dog, BC4 on that one
[02:33:07.080 --> 02:33:11.800]  and then just selecting from that original generation.
[02:33:12.800 --> 02:33:16.040]  Super consistent, it's got,
[02:33:16.040 --> 02:33:17.960]  banana doesn't get all chunked out
[02:33:17.960 --> 02:33:19.360]  like the black dog like that,
[02:33:19.360 --> 02:33:22.760]  it's a little bit more separate, amazing hash variety.
[02:33:22.760 --> 02:33:26.280]  So bringing them together is just really nice.
[02:33:26.280 --> 02:33:28.560]  You get a little bit more size than you would
[02:33:28.560 --> 02:33:32.440]  on straight black dog, you get insane heads
[02:33:32.440 --> 02:33:34.840]  and a little bit higher percent,
[02:33:34.840 --> 02:33:37.640]  well, definitely higher percent yield in ice water hash.
[02:33:38.760 --> 02:33:41.160]  Yeah, it's a really cool combination
[02:33:41.440 --> 02:33:43.200]  and just how consistent they are,
[02:33:43.200 --> 02:33:44.800]  the fact that you can like depth them
[02:33:44.800 --> 02:33:47.440]  and they look great when you have like,
[02:33:47.440 --> 02:33:49.160]  so many right next to each other.
[02:33:50.840 --> 02:33:54.680]  Yeah, just really, really solid farm genetic
[02:33:54.680 --> 02:33:58.120]  that you're gonna do well economically
[02:33:58.120 --> 02:33:59.240]  and you're gonna love.
[02:33:59.240 --> 02:34:03.920]  And to clarify the BC4 is you're going back
[02:34:03.920 --> 02:34:07.720]  into the female every time, the original female?
[02:34:07.720 --> 02:34:09.280]  Well, not the particular black dog, yeah.
[02:34:09.320 --> 02:34:11.280]  So it was putting, it's yeah,
[02:34:11.280 --> 02:34:12.920]  four generations of going back on
[02:34:12.920 --> 02:34:15.400]  to the 2012 black dog selection
[02:34:15.400 --> 02:34:19.160]  that like has been kind of my baby for a long time
[02:34:19.160 --> 02:34:21.600]  just to like make that as much of that.
[02:34:21.600 --> 02:34:24.960]  And then that works really good for making those hybrids
[02:34:24.960 --> 02:34:27.720]  because it's so much that genetic when you put it on
[02:34:28.840 --> 02:34:32.160]  and they end up like a lot larger
[02:34:32.160 --> 02:34:33.520]  because when you do that line breeding
[02:34:33.520 --> 02:34:34.560]  and you do back crossing,
[02:34:34.560 --> 02:34:37.040]  you lose a little bit of that size,
[02:34:37.040 --> 02:34:40.000]  you get more dwarfing and more consistency.
[02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:41.680]  But then the second you put that on
[02:34:41.680 --> 02:34:44.380]  to like something so different like the banana,
[02:34:44.380 --> 02:34:47.700]  you end up with this like really consistent hybrid
[02:34:47.700 --> 02:34:51.820]  where it's somewhere in between pretty fast growing,
[02:34:52.760 --> 02:34:54.880]  giant leaves, actually super fast growing.
[02:34:55.920 --> 02:34:58.840]  I was looking at some like, yeah,
[02:34:58.840 --> 02:35:01.860]  15 foot plants yesterday of them.
[02:35:03.280 --> 02:35:05.720]  Yeah, really, really, really nice stacking,
[02:35:05.720 --> 02:35:07.160]  insane early trichome.
[02:35:09.680 --> 02:35:12.000]  Yeah, make sure they look chunky.
[02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:12.840]  Yeah.
[02:35:16.400 --> 02:35:19.400]  Just quickly, what did Sheldon win
[02:35:22.200 --> 02:35:24.780]  and who was that going to?
[02:35:26.440 --> 02:35:27.680]  Anyone remember?
[02:35:27.680 --> 02:35:30.600]  John should be getting 500 from Sheldon
[02:35:30.600 --> 02:35:32.040]  for the vintage up game.
[02:35:36.900 --> 02:35:39.660]  But Sheldon's having problems and so is Shredder.
[02:35:41.820 --> 02:35:42.980]  Well, Sheldon just, wait,
[02:35:42.980 --> 02:35:45.100]  what problems is Sheldon having?
[02:35:50.780 --> 02:35:52.780]  Yeah, she's with Venmo he says.
[02:36:08.950 --> 02:36:11.270]  All right, so Sheldon, I just emailed you
[02:36:17.720 --> 02:36:19.400]  on the banana dog.
[02:36:20.280 --> 02:36:21.580]  What are we currently at?
[02:36:28.860 --> 02:36:31.340]  For the banana dog, we're sitting at 600
[02:36:31.340 --> 02:36:33.620]  for Midwest Outlaw 31.
[02:36:35.340 --> 02:36:40.020]  Jesse, what are a couple of projects
[02:36:40.460 --> 02:36:43.060]  that you're excited about this year that you're making?
[02:36:44.380 --> 02:36:47.580]  Well, just like yesterday and today,
[02:36:47.580 --> 02:36:49.660]  yesterday I went out to Bryceland Forest Farms
[02:36:49.660 --> 02:36:54.660]  and they have a whole section of hugelkultur grown
[02:36:55.100 --> 02:36:57.020]  cherry lime dog F3s.
[02:36:57.020 --> 02:37:01.060]  And so I had made my male selections
[02:37:01.060 --> 02:37:04.140]  and saved the pollen and came out
[02:37:04.140 --> 02:37:09.020]  and we tagged each lower branch and hit up each one
[02:37:09.180 --> 02:37:12.940]  and working on a cool selection of F4s out of there.
[02:37:12.940 --> 02:37:17.940]  I've already done an F4 selection here as well
[02:37:18.380 --> 02:37:21.140]  and did like a depth version of that
[02:37:21.140 --> 02:37:24.540]  and just found insane winners in there,
[02:37:24.540 --> 02:37:27.220]  just like some of my favorite smells
[02:37:27.220 --> 02:37:29.980]  and some super resistant.
[02:37:29.980 --> 02:37:31.780]  It's really nice to be able to see them all together
[02:37:31.780 --> 02:37:34.660]  and also be doing that in a really wet place.
[02:37:34.660 --> 02:37:37.500]  And I make sure that everything sees powdered mildew
[02:37:37.500 --> 02:37:40.740]  and rotten like super wet environment.
[02:37:40.740 --> 02:37:45.740]  And then I can really know how strong my selections are.
[02:37:47.660 --> 02:37:50.660]  Let's pause there.
[02:37:50.660 --> 02:37:52.980]  Sorry to pause you in mid thought,
[02:37:52.980 --> 02:37:55.780]  but we wrap this one up.
[02:37:55.780 --> 02:37:57.980]  What was the winning bid here?
[02:38:01.260 --> 02:38:04.940]  That was 600 from what I see.
[02:38:06.620 --> 02:38:08.060]  Oh yeah.
[02:38:08.140 --> 02:38:11.180]  Two Midwest Outlaw 31.
[02:38:22.030 --> 02:38:23.070]  Awesome, thank you.
[02:38:25.030 --> 02:38:26.670]  The reason I pause is cause I,
[02:38:26.670 --> 02:38:29.710]  are you going into that cherry lime dog auction next
[02:38:29.710 --> 02:38:32.070]  or what do you have next?
[02:38:32.070 --> 02:38:34.350]  Yeah, that's why I wanted to pause you there
[02:38:34.350 --> 02:38:36.910]  and let you explain that one in full.
[02:38:39.190 --> 02:38:44.190]  So just quickly, who was that one going to?
[02:38:44.670 --> 02:38:46.070]  Sean or Brett?
[02:38:46.070 --> 02:38:46.910]  Brett.
[02:38:46.910 --> 02:38:47.750]  Brett, okay.
[02:38:47.750 --> 02:38:48.990]  All right, Midwest Outlaw.
[02:38:48.990 --> 02:38:51.190]  All right, so let's go to this one
[02:38:51.190 --> 02:38:53.230]  and I'll do this offline.
[02:38:54.870 --> 02:38:56.070]  All right, Hype Man.
[02:38:58.150 --> 02:38:59.190]  Is that me or Josh?
[02:38:59.190 --> 02:39:00.030]  What?
[02:39:00.030 --> 02:39:00.870]  What?
[02:39:00.870 --> 02:39:04.190]  You guys are the hype tandem.
[02:39:04.190 --> 02:39:05.990]  Well, yeah, this is a good hype tandem
[02:39:05.990 --> 02:39:10.190]  because so tell me what is the cherry lime,
[02:39:10.190 --> 02:39:12.390]  what's the cherry lime that you put on the blackboard?
[02:39:12.630 --> 02:39:14.550]  What's the cherry lime that you put on the black dog?
[02:39:14.550 --> 02:39:16.310]  I assume that's what you did.
[02:39:16.310 --> 02:39:17.310]  It's cherry lime pop.
[02:39:17.310 --> 02:39:19.670]  It's the HGAS cherry lime pop.
[02:39:19.670 --> 02:39:20.670]  Cherry lime pop.
[02:39:20.670 --> 02:39:25.270]  That Eugene had gifted me that year to look through
[02:39:26.510 --> 02:39:28.750]  knowing I was doing some coastal stuff
[02:39:28.750 --> 02:39:31.910]  and just knowing kind of the flavors I like.
[02:39:33.230 --> 02:39:34.590]  Made a selection out of that
[02:39:34.590 --> 02:39:37.790]  and then put the black dog on that.
[02:39:37.790 --> 02:39:42.630]  And what you see in these pictures are F2s.
[02:39:42.630 --> 02:39:45.230]  And then, so this year I've grown up the F3s
[02:39:45.230 --> 02:39:47.270]  and making the F4s at the moment.
[02:39:48.710 --> 02:39:50.310]  But I'm also put them back.
[02:39:50.310 --> 02:39:55.230]  I also did a back cross to back onto the 2012 black dog.
[02:39:55.230 --> 02:40:00.230]  And so those are the BC1 F2s that are amazing this year.
[02:40:00.350 --> 02:40:03.510]  Those are also out at Moon Maid Farms.
[02:40:03.510 --> 02:40:06.150]  Those I've mentioned a little bit earlier.
[02:40:06.150 --> 02:40:09.390]  Oh man, they're so freaking chunky and far along
[02:40:09.390 --> 02:40:12.150]  and just so, the aroma is insane
[02:40:12.150 --> 02:40:15.990]  and as much frost as you can imagine on early flowers.
[02:40:15.990 --> 02:40:19.590]  And I think they're gonna all finish around,
[02:40:19.590 --> 02:40:21.670]  like there's gonna be some end of September
[02:40:21.670 --> 02:40:25.310]  and first week of October, like nice and early on those ones.
[02:40:25.310 --> 02:40:28.070]  These ones are about, yeah,
[02:40:28.070 --> 02:40:30.870]  about second week of October with these F3s.
[02:40:32.390 --> 02:40:34.310]  But it was just down at Bryceland Forest Farm
[02:40:34.310 --> 02:40:35.910]  just smelling every single one.
[02:40:36.750 --> 02:40:39.350]  We were just gonna pick a few to hit up
[02:40:39.350 --> 02:40:41.310]  and we ended up doing every single one.
[02:40:41.310 --> 02:40:42.510]  We were just like, this is ridiculous.
[02:40:42.510 --> 02:40:45.230]  There's no reason why we wouldn't do every one
[02:40:45.230 --> 02:40:47.950]  because they all just looked and smelled
[02:40:47.950 --> 02:40:51.550]  exactly kind of what I'd want.
[02:40:51.550 --> 02:40:54.590]  And at the end, it's really nice to be able to,
[02:40:55.790 --> 02:40:57.430]  to know that you hit up everything.
[02:40:57.430 --> 02:41:00.150]  And so like, sometimes things will trick you.
[02:41:00.150 --> 02:41:01.190]  You think it's this one
[02:41:01.190 --> 02:41:02.550]  and then it's something else at the end.
[02:41:02.550 --> 02:41:04.750]  So having them all like ready.
[02:41:05.310 --> 02:41:07.470]  And I've saved actually all the different clones
[02:41:07.470 --> 02:41:10.150]  from this year's selections too.
[02:41:10.150 --> 02:41:11.790]  And so I'll be able to use those
[02:41:11.790 --> 02:41:14.470]  for back crossing next year as well.
[02:41:16.390 --> 02:41:17.990]  Incredible terpene production.
[02:41:17.990 --> 02:41:22.990]  Like just, it kind of almost like hurts at first
[02:41:23.910 --> 02:41:26.630]  in this really, really good way,
[02:41:26.630 --> 02:41:29.670]  but thick and like kind of berries and ferment
[02:41:29.670 --> 02:41:34.270]  and cherry pop and that kind of,
[02:41:34.910 --> 02:41:36.670]  the berry from the black dog too.
[02:41:36.670 --> 02:41:39.870]  And it, yeah, it's a trippy, intense smell
[02:41:39.870 --> 02:41:42.110]  that like immediately makes me smile
[02:41:42.110 --> 02:41:44.990]  and like changes my like,
[02:41:44.990 --> 02:41:47.390]  my whole mental state just from the aroma.
[02:41:49.510 --> 02:41:52.750]  But yeah, it's a treat to see them grown so well too.
[02:41:52.750 --> 02:41:54.950]  So like at Bryceland being able to see them
[02:41:54.950 --> 02:41:57.470]  in these hugelkulturs, full polyculture around them,
[02:41:57.470 --> 02:41:59.470]  just so healthy and beautiful.
[02:41:59.470 --> 02:42:01.270]  The pictures that you're seeing here,
[02:42:01.270 --> 02:42:03.550]  this is at Newcomb Family Farm.
[02:42:04.070 --> 02:42:08.710]  You just all organic in the fully native soil
[02:42:08.710 --> 02:42:11.550]  that they grow amazing heirloom tomatoes
[02:42:11.550 --> 02:42:13.230]  and dry farm peaches out of.
[02:42:14.150 --> 02:42:17.910]  And these turned into like really amazing extracts as well
[02:42:17.910 --> 02:42:19.870]  to surprise, surprise has been making
[02:42:19.870 --> 02:42:22.190]  like incredible products out of them.
[02:42:22.190 --> 02:42:24.550]  Actually some of the best pens I've ever had in my life.
[02:42:24.550 --> 02:42:27.190]  I'm not normally that super into cards or anything,
[02:42:27.190 --> 02:42:29.350]  but to have something like from those genetics
[02:42:29.350 --> 02:42:30.990]  grown that well and extracted that well
[02:42:30.990 --> 02:42:32.670]  is like, it's really nice.
[02:42:33.710 --> 02:42:34.550]  But the-
[02:42:34.550 --> 02:42:35.710]  Starting number?
[02:42:35.710 --> 02:42:36.550]  What's that?
[02:42:36.550 --> 02:42:37.630]  Do we have a starting number?
[02:42:37.630 --> 02:42:39.030]  Let's get a bunch started.
[02:42:40.510 --> 02:42:41.350]  Three?
[02:42:41.350 --> 02:42:42.790]  Yeah, let's get it running.
[02:42:43.670 --> 02:42:44.510]  Three?
[02:42:46.710 --> 02:42:47.790]  Oh wow, that's low.
[02:42:49.150 --> 02:42:50.550]  What do we think?
[02:42:50.550 --> 02:42:52.030]  It's insanely low.
[02:42:52.030 --> 02:42:54.110]  Yeah, it's insanely low.
[02:42:54.110 --> 02:42:58.230]  But let's start at, let's do three and it'll go up.
[02:42:58.230 --> 02:43:01.550]  You know, people will hop on this real quick.
[02:43:01.550 --> 02:43:06.550]  So let's start the timer.
[02:43:08.110 --> 02:43:10.070]  What is the cherry lime pop?
[02:43:12.430 --> 02:43:13.990]  Oh, well, Jackson will be on tomorrow.
[02:43:13.990 --> 02:43:15.310]  He can give you the-
[02:43:15.310 --> 02:43:16.590]  I'll go explain that one.
[02:43:16.590 --> 02:43:17.430]  End up on that.
[02:43:17.430 --> 02:43:21.230]  I don't wanna mess anything up on that,
[02:43:21.230 --> 02:43:25.390]  but he's got a bunch, but you know, he's very detailed.
[02:43:25.390 --> 02:43:26.230]  Yeah, I know.
[02:43:26.230 --> 02:43:28.430]  I'm like, every time I try to guess, he's like,
[02:43:28.430 --> 02:43:30.470]  uh, you get that one wrong.
[02:43:30.510 --> 02:43:32.310]  Don't post that on IG.
[02:43:32.310 --> 02:43:34.550]  But he's on tomorrow.
[02:43:34.550 --> 02:43:36.750]  But yeah, it's been super fun going back and forth.
[02:43:36.750 --> 02:43:39.990]  He grew them last year and was so like, yeah,
[02:43:39.990 --> 02:43:40.830]  stoked on them.
[02:43:40.830 --> 02:43:42.910]  And then, yeah, really beautiful.
[02:43:43.870 --> 02:43:45.470]  Really beautiful production.
[02:43:45.470 --> 02:43:49.110]  He's doing some different black dog crosses this year too
[02:43:49.110 --> 02:43:50.830]  with his current projects.
[02:43:58.140 --> 02:43:59.740]  So I need to go in and time out?
[02:44:00.780 --> 02:44:01.620]  No.
[02:44:02.140 --> 02:44:03.220]  What's that?
[02:44:04.300 --> 02:44:05.980]  MK420.
[02:44:08.300 --> 02:44:09.820]  Oh, we have someone misbehaving in chat.
[02:44:09.820 --> 02:44:12.420]  It was an okay joke the first time.
[02:44:14.020 --> 02:44:16.580]  And then the second and then the third time,
[02:44:16.580 --> 02:44:22.900]  it was less and less funny.
[02:44:22.900 --> 02:44:23.740]  I missed it.
[02:44:23.740 --> 02:44:27.980]  So Krobotacio is at, oh wow, Karma Farms.
[02:44:31.970 --> 02:44:33.890]  Look at this, the more tired people get,
[02:44:33.890 --> 02:44:48.540]  the reviews in the chat are-
[02:44:49.460 --> 02:44:51.060]  Are these the F3s then?
[02:44:53.820 --> 02:44:55.100]  Sorry, I lost.
[02:44:55.100 --> 02:44:56.780]  So actually what I was thinking about doing
[02:44:56.780 --> 02:45:01.740]  was doing 10 of the F3 and 10 of the back cross.
[02:45:01.740 --> 02:45:05.620]  But I could just keep it all 20 of the F3 to keep it simple.
[02:45:08.060 --> 02:45:13.060]  I mean, if you're seeing that much, you know, stability in it
[02:45:14.620 --> 02:45:17.060]  it might be cool to have both, right?
[02:45:17.060 --> 02:45:20.900]  Yeah, well, they're both, it's actually pretty stunning.
[02:45:20.900 --> 02:45:24.620]  Like, yeah, everyone, the aroma is like fully spot on
[02:45:24.620 --> 02:45:25.900]  but they're different directions.
[02:45:25.900 --> 02:45:30.900]  So like, you know, one is for a little bit earlier flower,
[02:45:31.100 --> 02:45:34.220]  insane beauty, it gets dark really easy
[02:45:35.420 --> 02:45:39.500]  and just insane early frost production.
[02:45:39.500 --> 02:45:43.300]  And then, but also just like a more well-structured
[02:45:43.300 --> 02:45:46.340]  cushy plant with that back dog back cross.
[02:45:46.380 --> 02:45:51.380]  And then the F3s are a little bit more tall in the growth
[02:45:51.660 --> 02:45:56.660]  and a little more spike in the intensity of the aroma
[02:45:57.740 --> 02:45:59.820]  instead of like a little bit of that sweetness
[02:45:59.820 --> 02:46:03.060]  just like wrapping it up a little bit more in the BC.
[02:46:03.060 --> 02:46:06.380]  So they're both like insanely good directions.
[02:46:06.380 --> 02:46:10.300]  And yeah, it's hard for me to like choose either one.
[02:46:10.300 --> 02:46:13.420]  So it was super cool to see like the F3s at Bricelyn
[02:46:13.420 --> 02:46:15.420]  and then to see the cherry moons
[02:46:15.420 --> 02:46:19.900]  which are the BC1 F2s out at Moon Maids today
[02:46:19.900 --> 02:46:23.700]  and seeing just, yeah, I just love both expressions.
[02:46:23.700 --> 02:46:24.700]  That's super cool.
[02:46:24.700 --> 02:46:26.180]  As you were talking about that too,
[02:46:26.180 --> 02:46:29.980]  to have that opportunity to visit different farms
[02:46:29.980 --> 02:46:34.980]  and make selections, there's a lot of value there.
[02:46:36.900 --> 02:46:38.940]  And also, I mean, it's so huge.
[02:46:38.940 --> 02:46:40.540]  I love being able to work with farmers
[02:46:40.540 --> 02:46:42.980]  and then farmers who are growing the plant so well.
[02:46:43.500 --> 02:46:44.340]  So it's like, you get to see your seeds
[02:46:44.340 --> 02:46:47.500]  and like, it's like the most ideal possible place
[02:46:47.500 --> 02:46:48.340]  for them to be.
[02:46:48.340 --> 02:46:52.620]  Like these giant plants, so healthy, so happy,
[02:46:52.620 --> 02:46:54.500]  surrounded by polyculture,
[02:46:54.500 --> 02:46:56.580]  fully like tapped into just living soil
[02:46:56.580 --> 02:46:59.300]  with like people that love them and care about them.
[02:46:59.300 --> 02:47:00.700]  Yeah, it's super fun to see.
[02:47:17.980 --> 02:47:20.620]  Currently at 5.50 with six minutes to go.
[02:47:20.620 --> 02:47:22.500]  Karma Farms is in the lead.
[02:47:25.780 --> 02:47:27.780]  Yeah, so there is no other way to get these
[02:47:27.820 --> 02:47:30.820]  than something like this with these auction things.
[02:47:30.820 --> 02:47:33.020]  Like they have not been released in any way.
[02:47:34.900 --> 02:47:36.540]  So yeah, it's kind of,
[02:47:40.300 --> 02:47:41.940]  it's an opportunity.
[02:47:45.220 --> 02:47:48.060]  Some work and yeah, I love this plant.
[02:47:48.060 --> 02:47:50.300]  It's insane how good it is.
[02:47:50.300 --> 02:47:52.820]  It's what I could smoke all like just forever.
[02:47:56.340 --> 02:47:57.500]  That's fucking good.
[02:47:57.500 --> 02:47:58.900]  That's fucking good feeling.
[02:48:03.090 --> 02:48:03.930]  Ooh.
[02:48:05.690 --> 02:48:06.970]  Don't do that.
[02:48:06.970 --> 02:48:07.970]  No, sorry.
[02:48:09.610 --> 02:48:11.650]  But it feels pretty good to have all these like
[02:48:11.650 --> 02:48:13.970]  beautiful selections that are like now hit
[02:48:13.970 --> 02:48:15.610]  with the selected pollen right now.
[02:48:15.610 --> 02:48:18.970]  And then we get to like, when we explore all those flowers,
[02:48:18.970 --> 02:48:21.050]  we get to know that that's there.
[02:48:22.130 --> 02:48:23.850]  Yeah, that feels good.
[02:48:23.850 --> 02:48:25.410]  And I've already made my like, yeah,
[02:48:25.410 --> 02:48:26.650]  my selections here too.
[02:48:26.650 --> 02:48:28.970]  And it's cool.
[02:48:28.970 --> 02:48:31.570]  This year worked out really well with this project.
[02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:40.000]  And I love like, yeah, just having Jackson's work in there
[02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:42.040]  and having something to go back and forth with that.
[02:48:42.040 --> 02:48:44.160]  It's been cool to have him on tomorrow.
[02:48:44.160 --> 02:48:46.280]  I think we're gonna have a lot of really cool people on
[02:48:46.280 --> 02:48:49.440]  and yeah, the conversations will be good.
[02:48:49.440 --> 02:48:50.280]  That's for sure.
[02:48:51.360 --> 02:48:52.560]  So tired today though.
[02:48:54.920 --> 02:48:55.760]  Thank you.
[02:48:58.720 --> 02:49:00.440]  Yeah, this is a,
[02:49:00.440 --> 02:49:02.640]  it's a rambunctious crowd.
[02:49:04.760 --> 02:49:07.400]  So I have people basically emailing me
[02:49:07.400 --> 02:49:10.960]  and I appreciate these people saying if someone doesn't pay,
[02:49:10.960 --> 02:49:13.720]  they will gladly pay for specific things.
[02:49:13.720 --> 02:49:15.920]  Cool, we got backup.
[02:49:17.480 --> 02:49:19.920]  And so I'm trying to keep notes of these people
[02:49:19.920 --> 02:49:23.480]  because then tomorrow morning I have to like go through
[02:49:23.480 --> 02:49:26.800]  all the emails and messages and the chat.
[02:49:26.920 --> 02:49:31.440]  The fun part of linking YouTube usernames to the payments
[02:49:31.440 --> 02:49:34.840]  to Sean, you need to tell me who paid you.
[02:49:34.840 --> 02:49:36.880]  Brett needs to tell me who paid him.
[02:49:38.960 --> 02:49:41.480]  I need to publicly shame people
[02:49:43.200 --> 02:49:47.200]  like Soviet Smoker and Staten Island.
[02:49:48.400 --> 02:49:51.440]  Only payment I was received is from the Theo Gallagher guy,
[02:49:51.440 --> 02:49:52.280]  unless,
[02:49:52.320 --> 02:49:54.360]  New Englanders are trustworthy people.
[02:49:54.360 --> 02:49:58.710]  Yeah, and that we actually kind of realized
[02:49:58.710 --> 02:50:01.710]  that there's been like huge internet brawls
[02:50:01.710 --> 02:50:03.590]  and accusations of theft.
[02:50:03.590 --> 02:50:06.350]  And like looking back, it's like, well,
[02:50:06.350 --> 02:50:09.670]  those auctions just probably didn't get fulfilled.
[02:50:09.670 --> 02:50:11.390]  It wasn't that, you know,
[02:50:11.390 --> 02:50:14.150]  there was someone stealing the money necessarily,
[02:50:14.150 --> 02:50:18.230]  but it's nice that we can still do that.
[02:50:18.230 --> 02:50:19.590]  I mean, I'm not gonna lie,
[02:50:19.590 --> 02:50:20.630]  I'm not gonna lie to you,
[02:50:20.910 --> 02:50:24.430]  but it's nice that we can set it up this way
[02:50:24.430 --> 02:50:26.030]  where we don't have to touch the money.
[02:50:26.030 --> 02:50:30.150]  We can just have it directly deposited into, you know.
[02:50:31.350 --> 02:50:34.630]  Right, but to everybody watching the downside
[02:50:34.630 --> 02:50:36.990]  is that there's no way to quickly verify
[02:50:36.990 --> 02:50:38.750]  that someone paid for something.
[02:50:40.750 --> 02:50:43.070]  Sean, are you PayPal or you PayPal, right?
[02:50:43.070 --> 02:50:43.910]  Venmo?
[02:50:43.910 --> 02:50:45.150]  I can't remember. Venmo.
[02:50:45.150 --> 02:50:45.990]  Venmo, okay.
[02:50:46.870 --> 02:50:49.270]  Yeah, I've had people email me saying
[02:50:49.270 --> 02:50:51.070]  that Venmo has been difficult,
[02:50:51.070 --> 02:50:53.070]  but I don't understand what that means.
[02:50:54.630 --> 02:50:56.990]  So Sheldon Sink said, just to clarify,
[02:50:56.990 --> 02:51:04.880]  I'm in Durban, South Africa, home of Durban poison.
[02:51:04.880 --> 02:51:06.920]  I've never, so what's, by the way, Sheldon,
[02:51:06.920 --> 02:51:11.080]  what time is it in Durban, South Africa right now?
[02:51:12.720 --> 02:51:14.720]  And he said, I've never had a Venmo account
[02:51:14.720 --> 02:51:16.480]  in signing up for a PayPal account.
[02:51:16.760 --> 02:51:18.760]  And he said, I've never had a Venmo account
[02:51:18.760 --> 02:51:21.240]  in signing up isn't working.
[02:51:21.240 --> 02:51:22.840]  That's why I was assuming Venmo,
[02:51:22.840 --> 02:51:24.040]  you can just put like your,
[02:51:24.040 --> 02:51:26.640]  your like MasterCard or Visa number in,
[02:51:26.640 --> 02:51:30.800]  but we're finding these things out on the fly,
[02:51:30.800 --> 02:51:32.520]  what you do internationally.
[02:51:34.840 --> 02:51:39.720]  What, wait, so what country isn't allowing Venmo?
[02:51:44.560 --> 02:51:46.880]  Didn't someone talk about a country that,
[02:51:46.880 --> 02:51:48.480]  where you can't use Venmo?
[02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:54.240]  Like two hours ago or before we started?
[02:51:56.120 --> 02:51:56.960]  Not me.
[02:51:58.680 --> 02:52:02.600]  Yeah, maybe it was an email exchange I had with someone.
[02:52:02.600 --> 02:52:05.200]  It was mentioned, I can't remember what it said.
[02:52:08.140 --> 02:52:09.780]  All right, so while Sheldon, all right,
[02:52:09.780 --> 02:52:13.300]  so Sheldon Black is in South Africa.
[02:52:16.700 --> 02:52:18.580]  I forget what Sheldon won,
[02:52:19.220 --> 02:52:21.380]  but Sheldon, we will resolve it
[02:52:21.380 --> 02:52:23.300]  when I wake up tomorrow morning.
[02:52:25.420 --> 02:52:28.500]  What are we current, we're on,
[02:52:28.500 --> 02:52:30.940]  oh, I know we're on, we're on that, right?
[02:52:32.740 --> 02:52:34.700]  We're at 550.
[02:52:34.700 --> 02:52:36.580]  Oh, these ones should be a lot more.
[02:52:38.180 --> 02:52:42.020]  Explain the Black Dog a little bit better,
[02:52:42.020 --> 02:52:43.420]  a little bit more, Jesse.
[02:52:43.700 --> 02:52:47.380]  Well, it's Blackberry Kush with Lemon Larry OG
[02:52:47.380 --> 02:52:48.860]  and the Kelly Sour D.
[02:52:51.380 --> 02:52:56.380]  Out of back in 2011 and then 2012,
[02:52:58.420 --> 02:53:02.060]  the selection that came out of it was just like,
[02:53:02.060 --> 02:53:05.380]  they were all really good, but like this one just,
[02:53:05.380 --> 02:53:06.860]  yeah, it was just super special,
[02:53:06.860 --> 02:53:08.660]  insanely easy to get into.
[02:53:08.660 --> 02:53:10.420]  And then the other one was,
[02:53:11.380 --> 02:53:12.700]  yeah, it was just super special,
[02:53:12.700 --> 02:53:14.060]  insanely easy to trim,
[02:53:14.060 --> 02:53:17.180]  like just kind of thing where it took
[02:53:17.180 --> 02:53:20.980]  like less than two hours to trim a pound, you know?
[02:53:20.980 --> 02:53:22.740]  So it's like kind of the stuff
[02:53:22.740 --> 02:53:24.700]  that you'd want to keep to yourself to trim
[02:53:24.700 --> 02:53:26.900]  or bring it out like after something else
[02:53:26.900 --> 02:53:29.140]  was like kind of shitty or something,
[02:53:29.140 --> 02:53:30.300]  you know, dessert trim.
[02:53:32.140 --> 02:53:35.700]  But yeah, kept that clone and then,
[02:53:35.700 --> 02:53:37.300]  yeah, just went back with the seeds
[02:53:37.300 --> 02:53:39.460]  and worked with them
[02:53:39.460 --> 02:53:41.300]  and then started making the back cross on that.
[02:53:41.300 --> 02:53:45.340]  And then just kept doing that a bunch of times
[02:53:45.340 --> 02:53:48.140]  as well as doing the sibling generations
[02:53:48.140 --> 02:53:51.460]  and then also doing a bunch of different other crosses.
[02:53:51.460 --> 02:53:53.660]  So it was kind of like this project to like,
[02:53:55.860 --> 02:53:57.220]  kind of cross it with everything
[02:53:57.220 --> 02:53:58.740]  and then do sandwiches with it.
[02:53:58.740 --> 02:54:00.660]  I really like doing black dog sandwiches.
[02:54:00.660 --> 02:54:03.020]  So that's kind of like the BC one idea.
[02:54:03.020 --> 02:54:06.500]  So actually the original like Cherry Lime Dog 2,
[02:54:06.500 --> 02:54:11.500]  that was, you know, it's taking that black dog male,
[02:54:12.140 --> 02:54:14.500]  putting it on the Cherry Lime Pop selection
[02:54:14.500 --> 02:54:18.260]  and then putting it back on that 2012 black dog.
[02:54:18.260 --> 02:54:20.860]  And then that way, like it locks in that structure
[02:54:20.860 --> 02:54:23.220]  that I wanted that worked better for,
[02:54:23.220 --> 02:54:25.220]  the lime pop is very tall
[02:54:25.220 --> 02:54:28.900]  and it also could lose its limbs really easy.
[02:54:28.900 --> 02:54:33.740]  And also black dog takes out intersex issues really well,
[02:54:33.780 --> 02:54:37.380]  just like kind of nullifies it in a lot of things,
[02:54:37.380 --> 02:54:39.700]  really, really stable.
[02:54:39.700 --> 02:54:42.700]  It's like just a super female plant when it's female.
[02:54:42.700 --> 02:54:46.500]  And so I really like the way that it brings on structure
[02:54:46.500 --> 02:54:50.940]  and it brings on resistance in powdery mildew.
[02:54:50.940 --> 02:54:53.260]  And it's also an early flower too.
[02:54:53.260 --> 02:54:57.060]  So it's like, it's kind of that perfect harvest time for me,
[02:54:57.060 --> 02:54:59.300]  like right before that first rain hits.
[02:54:59.300 --> 02:55:02.460]  So it's like, you can take it right around October 1st.
[02:55:02.460 --> 02:55:04.580]  You could let it ride a little bit if weather's good,
[02:55:04.580 --> 02:55:06.620]  but it just like, it hits that point
[02:55:06.620 --> 02:55:10.940]  where it has enough time to grow before it goes into flower,
[02:55:10.940 --> 02:55:12.820]  but then it flowers really quickly
[02:55:12.820 --> 02:55:15.500]  and you can get it at a nice time.
[02:55:17.020 --> 02:55:19.100]  And then, you know, the market's still good then too.
[02:55:19.100 --> 02:55:22.700]  So it made, you know, the lime pop a little bit earlier,
[02:55:22.700 --> 02:55:24.180]  gave it more structure.
[02:55:25.460 --> 02:55:27.140]  It, instead of being so sharp,
[02:55:27.140 --> 02:55:29.380]  it brings in a little bit of that sugar
[02:55:30.300 --> 02:55:32.340]  that balances it out really well,
[02:55:33.220 --> 02:55:34.820]  but you still have this euphoric smell
[02:55:34.820 --> 02:55:36.820]  that is what I really liked from it.
[02:55:36.820 --> 02:55:39.500]  But like, I love the balance of the two.
[02:55:39.500 --> 02:55:42.140]  The trichome production is insane.
[02:55:42.140 --> 02:55:47.140]  It goes, every single leaf is just full sugar coated.
[02:55:48.500 --> 02:55:53.140]  Like it's hard to actually like tell the difference
[02:55:53.140 --> 02:55:57.820]  between a leaf and the flower on how coated it is.
[02:55:57.980 --> 02:56:02.980]  But yeah, real, real intense terpenes
[02:56:03.020 --> 02:56:04.860]  that are just so pleasant
[02:56:04.860 --> 02:56:07.060]  and work really, really well for extraction.
[02:56:10.300 --> 02:56:12.740]  Oh yeah, I think we have a winner.
[02:56:19.990 --> 02:56:22.670]  Karma Farms for 550, is that correct?
[02:56:22.670 --> 02:56:23.510]  Yep.
[02:56:24.710 --> 02:56:29.710]  Yeah, Karma Farms 550 for the BioVortex Cherry Lime Dog.
[02:56:30.350 --> 02:56:31.310]  That's a steal.
[02:56:32.310 --> 02:56:33.950]  Thanks for putting it up, Jesse.
[02:56:33.950 --> 02:56:35.190]  It's a cool project, man.
[02:56:36.230 --> 02:56:38.750]  I really would like to smoke some of that weed.
[02:56:40.510 --> 02:56:41.950]  I can't wait, yeah.
[02:56:41.950 --> 02:56:43.910]  Some coming up soon.
[02:56:43.910 --> 02:56:45.670]  But yeah, both Bricelin and Moonmaid
[02:56:45.670 --> 02:56:47.030]  are gonna have some of the best flowers
[02:56:47.030 --> 02:56:48.630]  on the market, I think.
[02:56:48.630 --> 02:56:50.270]  Yeah, that's fucking cool.
[02:56:50.270 --> 02:56:52.830]  I have smoked the Moonmaid flower
[02:56:54.190 --> 02:56:59.190]  circa December 2019 and it was very good.
[02:57:00.710 --> 02:57:02.190]  It'll be real good this year.
[02:57:03.510 --> 02:57:05.910]  So, all right, so who just won?
[02:57:05.910 --> 02:57:07.430]  Canna, no, wait, sorry.
[02:57:07.430 --> 02:57:11.190]  Karma Farms, okay, so Karma Farms.
[02:57:11.190 --> 02:57:15.750]  And that goes to Sean.
[02:57:15.750 --> 02:57:16.990]  All right, Sean.
[02:57:18.670 --> 02:57:21.110]  You gotta open your eyes at least halfway
[02:57:21.110 --> 02:57:22.390]  to receive this payment.
[02:57:23.990 --> 02:57:26.710]  All right, so Canna Farms,
[02:57:26.750 --> 02:57:31.430]  you are LaCassie McDiaz on Venmo.
[02:57:41.470 --> 02:57:43.270]  All right, so should we,
[02:57:44.590 --> 02:57:46.470]  since everybody's eyes are closed.
[02:57:47.550 --> 02:57:49.310]  Yeah, I think we should wrap it up for the night
[02:57:49.310 --> 02:57:50.790]  and come in with a-
[02:57:50.790 --> 02:57:52.150]  Come strong tomorrow.
[02:57:52.150 --> 02:57:53.910]  Everybody get a good night's sleep
[02:57:53.910 --> 02:57:58.350]  and bring your high energy tomorrow night.
[02:57:59.350 --> 02:58:05.750]  Some breeders whose seeds will be auctioned off
[02:58:05.910 --> 02:58:10.910]  tomorrow night include Mean Gene from Mendocino,
[02:58:12.510 --> 02:58:19.040]  Rebel Grown, actually North Coast Genetics,
[02:58:23.440 --> 02:58:31.250]  Seattle Chronic Seeds, Emerald Mountain, right?
[02:58:35.090 --> 02:58:36.090]  Olfactory.
[02:58:36.090 --> 02:58:40.530]  Ice House Foundation, Olfactory, HBK,
[02:58:40.530 --> 02:58:41.770]  we didn't do tonight.
[02:58:43.770 --> 02:58:45.250]  I'm gonna put up-
[02:58:45.250 --> 02:58:46.450]  Blockchain.
[02:58:50.180 --> 02:58:52.020]  Blockchain Novelties, he's got,
[02:58:54.020 --> 02:58:55.220]  what is he got, I can't remember.
[02:58:55.220 --> 02:58:56.940]  He's got a really cool pack.
[02:58:59.220 --> 02:59:03.460]  I was gonna reach out to Mel Frank and or Todd McCormick,
[02:59:04.460 --> 02:59:06.540]  Kaya, but anyway.
[02:59:08.180 --> 02:59:10.820]  At our slow pace, we have aspirations
[02:59:10.820 --> 02:59:13.100]  to get through like 30 auctions
[02:59:13.100 --> 02:59:14.860]  and we get through like eight, but.
[02:59:17.700 --> 02:59:20.260]  I'm gonna say that whoever's still listening,
[02:59:20.260 --> 02:59:25.260]  I'm gonna put up two cuts of anything in my library.
[02:59:26.380 --> 02:59:30.220]  So I'll have to get a better, a list up for tomorrow
[02:59:30.220 --> 02:59:32.780]  or kind of a list.
[02:59:32.940 --> 02:59:34.740]  But whoever wins that bid,
[02:59:34.740 --> 02:59:37.180]  I'll just basically give them access to my library
[02:59:37.180 --> 02:59:39.340]  and they can kind of pick any two.
[02:59:39.340 --> 02:59:42.140]  Take pretty pictures of all your plants and I'll,
[02:59:43.020 --> 02:59:46.620]  can everybody appreciate my amazing Photoshop skills?
[02:59:48.300 --> 02:59:51.340]  These are some of the shittiest graphics I've created.
[02:59:51.340 --> 02:59:53.220]  I'd create a slide and I'd be like,
[02:59:53.220 --> 02:59:54.380]  oh, that looks terrible.
[02:59:54.380 --> 02:59:59.380]  But yeah, ESPN and the Olympics, we are not.
[03:00:03.740 --> 03:00:07.100]  And we're not winning Emmys for graphics tonight.
[03:00:07.100 --> 03:00:11.140]  But all right, so well, Sean,
[03:00:11.980 --> 03:00:13.460]  I'm gonna talk to you tomorrow.
[03:00:13.460 --> 03:00:14.900]  I'm gonna talk to Brett tomorrow,
[03:00:14.900 --> 03:00:19.900]  but hopefully this put something in the bank account
[03:00:20.460 --> 03:00:24.540]  to help you rebuild and figure shit out
[03:00:24.540 --> 03:00:27.580]  because nobody wants to go through what you went through.
[03:00:28.420 --> 03:00:31.260]  I really appreciate everybody's hard work.
[03:00:31.260 --> 03:00:33.260]  Hopefully I did something.
[03:00:37.620 --> 03:00:41.700]  And so with that, so all right, so yeah, we're done tonight.
[03:00:41.700 --> 03:00:46.660]  So for people watching tomorrow at eight, right?
[03:00:49.100 --> 03:00:54.100]  And yeah, we, as I said,
[03:00:55.060 --> 03:00:57.740]  we intended to get through lots of stuff
[03:00:57.740 --> 03:01:01.260]  and we got through less than lots of stuff, but.
[03:01:01.260 --> 03:01:03.060]  We made it through 10 of them.
[03:01:03.060 --> 03:01:03.900]  All right.
[03:01:05.420 --> 03:01:08.780]  And some had a bunch of like, Bob had like 35.
[03:01:08.780 --> 03:01:12.260]  You know, the thing is we need to bring Nick Risen
[03:01:12.260 --> 03:01:13.700]  on tomorrow night.
[03:01:13.700 --> 03:01:16.060]  He can get all whiskied up and fire this thing.
[03:01:16.060 --> 03:01:16.900]  That will help.
[03:01:20.540 --> 03:01:21.380]  Yeah, we.
[03:01:21.380 --> 03:01:22.220]  And a lot of soda too.
[03:01:22.340 --> 03:01:23.180]  Yeah.

[03:01:38.780 --> 03:01:40.020]  But then he just shuts down.
[03:01:40.020 --> 03:01:40.860]  It's like, whoa.
[03:01:44.420 --> 03:01:45.700]  I don't know if that's shutting down
[03:01:45.700 --> 03:01:47.220]  or going over the top.
[03:01:48.220 --> 03:01:49.060]  All right.
