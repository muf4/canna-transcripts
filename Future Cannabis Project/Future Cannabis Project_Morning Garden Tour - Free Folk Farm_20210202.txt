[00:00.000 --> 00:02.280]  Oh, it's so perfect, too.
[00:03.400 --> 00:04.400]  What was it?
[00:04.760 --> 00:06.960]  This was my
[00:07.600 --> 00:09.840]  I was smoking and
[00:09.840 --> 00:11.640]  then decided to do
[00:11.800 --> 00:13.960]  I have fun with like amuse myself
[00:13.960 --> 00:15.080]  and Photoshop.
[00:15.480 --> 00:17.000]  And then I did an arts and craft
[00:17.000 --> 00:18.120]  project with
[00:19.960 --> 00:21.360]  I was harvesting
[00:22.080 --> 00:24.040]  brassica, basically the seed
[00:24.040 --> 00:25.040]  pods.
[00:25.440 --> 00:27.260]  And so I was artistic
[00:27.260 --> 00:29.060]  with that. But anyway, good morning,
[00:29.060 --> 00:30.940]  everyone. I hope the
[00:30.940 --> 00:32.820]  poos have all been taken.
[00:33.220 --> 00:34.900]  The coffee is in hand
[00:35.740 --> 00:37.420]  and we are we are
[00:37.740 --> 00:39.900]  traveling to Oklahoma
[00:39.900 --> 00:41.900]  today to
[00:41.900 --> 00:43.360]  visit with the free folk.
[00:43.380 --> 00:44.900]  And there is one
[00:45.500 --> 00:47.540]  and there is the other.
[00:48.100 --> 00:50.060]  And that's the whole
[00:50.060 --> 00:51.060]  crew.
[00:51.140 --> 00:52.140]  So welcome, everyone.
[00:52.180 --> 00:54.140]  So, Scott, why don't you start
[00:54.140 --> 00:55.420]  and say, I mean, how do you know
[00:55.420 --> 00:56.300]  these guys?
[00:56.300 --> 00:57.300]  And
[00:58.300 --> 00:59.540]  were you just driving through
[00:59.540 --> 01:01.280]  Oklahoma and you made a pit stop or
[01:01.300 --> 01:02.300]  what happened?
[01:02.380 --> 01:03.980]  Yeah, I just happened to be
[01:05.140 --> 01:06.460]  27 hours from home.
[01:06.900 --> 01:07.900]  And
[01:08.700 --> 01:09.700]  no,
[01:10.340 --> 01:11.920]  they reached out to us a while ago.
[01:11.940 --> 01:13.940]  I can't remember exactly
[01:13.940 --> 01:15.300]  when. But the reason why we
[01:15.900 --> 01:17.700]  kind of came on the show today is,
[01:18.460 --> 01:20.160]  you know, Jacob and Jason are kind of
[01:20.180 --> 01:21.180]  unique.
[01:22.580 --> 01:23.740]  You know, we've worked with
[01:24.380 --> 01:25.900]  literally hundreds of farms
[01:26.300 --> 01:28.020]  doing soul food web techniques.
[01:28.020 --> 01:29.020]  And
[01:29.980 --> 01:31.740]  usually when we sign on a new farm,
[01:31.740 --> 01:32.940]  we go through a process of
[01:32.940 --> 01:34.100]  qualifying compost.
[01:34.100 --> 01:35.100]  So normally farms
[01:35.860 --> 01:37.320]  have a compost that they're used to
[01:37.340 --> 01:38.820]  using locally or
[01:39.420 --> 01:40.660]  they're making it themselves.
[01:40.660 --> 01:41.660]  And then we kind of go through the
[01:41.660 --> 01:43.500]  qualification process to see
[01:44.140 --> 01:46.420]  if that compost is biologically
[01:46.420 --> 01:48.460]  complete and suits the needs
[01:48.460 --> 01:50.220]  for the task.
[01:50.220 --> 01:52.020]  And what's unique about free folk is
[01:52.420 --> 01:53.700]  of all the farms that we work with,
[01:53.700 --> 01:55.420]  they were the first farm that had
[01:55.420 --> 01:57.100]  been making compost before we met
[01:57.100 --> 01:58.100]  them that we
[01:59.060 --> 02:00.500]  would define as biologically
[02:00.500 --> 02:02.420]  complete and suitable for the task.
[02:02.780 --> 02:04.900]  And, you know, usually
[02:04.900 --> 02:07.220]  after we work with a farm, they
[02:07.220 --> 02:09.100]  see the value of the compost we
[02:09.100 --> 02:11.100]  bring to them. And some of those
[02:11.100 --> 02:12.500]  farms move on to make their own
[02:12.500 --> 02:13.500]  compost.
[02:13.940 --> 02:15.680]  A couple of those farms have moved
[02:15.700 --> 02:17.320]  on to make biologically complete
[02:17.320 --> 02:18.320]  compost.
[02:18.340 --> 02:20.420]  And, you know, Jacob and Jason
[02:20.420 --> 02:22.140]  were making that before we met them.
[02:22.220 --> 02:23.540]  And I think it
[02:24.300 --> 02:26.260]  I think it really signifies a
[02:26.260 --> 02:28.240]  turning point in the industry
[02:28.260 --> 02:29.100]  at large.
[02:29.100 --> 02:30.540]  You know, we're starting to see the
[02:30.540 --> 02:32.420]  soul food web movement kind of
[02:33.060 --> 02:34.460]  pick up steam, I guess you could
[02:34.460 --> 02:35.460]  say.
[02:36.420 --> 02:37.520]  And so I think that's a really
[02:37.540 --> 02:38.860]  unique aspect. And that was one of
[02:38.860 --> 02:40.540]  the main reasons why we wanted to
[02:40.660 --> 02:41.520]  bring them on.
[02:41.540 --> 02:43.420]  And also
[02:43.420 --> 02:45.500]  to like, it's just it's just better
[02:45.500 --> 02:47.220]  for us, Sarah and I's work.
[02:47.220 --> 02:49.140]  If we just never talk about
[02:49.140 --> 02:50.980]  our work, it's just far
[02:50.980 --> 02:52.260]  less complicated that way.
[02:52.780 --> 02:54.780]  It's just really better for everyone
[02:54.780 --> 02:55.780]  in most cases.
[02:55.820 --> 02:56.820]  And, you know,
[02:57.780 --> 02:59.700]  so far, zero point zero zero
[02:59.700 --> 03:00.700]  farms we've worked with
[03:01.500 --> 03:03.500]  have been super interested in
[03:04.940 --> 03:06.540]  going, you know, speaking publicly
[03:06.540 --> 03:08.480]  about the types of benefits
[03:08.480 --> 03:09.640]  that we bring to their farms.
[03:10.300 --> 03:12.180]  And Jacob and Jason, on one
[03:12.180 --> 03:13.460]  of the last phone calls we had of
[03:13.460 --> 03:14.540]  our little weekly chats,
[03:15.300 --> 03:17.460]  you know, they said people
[03:17.460 --> 03:18.740]  need to talk about this, like the
[03:18.740 --> 03:20.780]  world's changing radically.
[03:21.300 --> 03:22.540]  You know, the future is
[03:23.220 --> 03:24.500]  kind of weird and
[03:25.500 --> 03:27.020]  we need to show examples.
[03:27.020 --> 03:28.900]  And so Sarah
[03:28.900 --> 03:30.220]  and I kind of agreed, you know,
[03:30.220 --> 03:31.460]  we're a little always a little
[03:31.460 --> 03:32.980]  nervous about showing our work, but
[03:32.980 --> 03:34.660]  they are right. And so the kind of
[03:34.660 --> 03:35.860]  the goal of this garden tour is a
[03:35.860 --> 03:37.140]  little bit of both, like show the
[03:37.140 --> 03:38.220]  inside of their garden.
[03:39.140 --> 03:40.140]  But then our garden
[03:41.100 --> 03:43.140]  is other people's farms.
[03:43.180 --> 03:44.340]  And so we're going to show you a
[03:44.340 --> 03:45.860]  little bit about what we think is
[03:45.860 --> 03:47.220]  valuable in the commercial space.
[03:47.860 --> 03:49.780]  And then, you know, whatever
[03:50.420 --> 03:51.660]  Jacob and Jason want to show you
[03:51.660 --> 03:52.420]  all.
[03:52.420 --> 03:53.420]  But I
[03:54.340 --> 03:56.100]  would I would be so bold to say
[03:56.100 --> 03:58.020]  that what Jacob and Jason are doing
[03:58.020 --> 03:59.940]  in their farm will be
[03:59.940 --> 04:01.460]  the predominant cultivation
[04:02.620 --> 04:04.700]  technique and style in
[04:05.260 --> 04:06.700]  really the commercial space or all
[04:06.700 --> 04:08.740]  spaces over the next
[04:08.740 --> 04:09.740]  couple of years.
[04:10.380 --> 04:12.180]  So we executed well, it's
[04:12.180 --> 04:13.180]  a great team.
[04:13.980 --> 04:15.760]  Can we maybe start with a
[04:15.760 --> 04:17.740]  definition of biologically
[04:17.740 --> 04:19.060]  complete? And like I assume
[04:19.780 --> 04:21.220]  you go to lots of places where they
[04:21.220 --> 04:22.940]  proudly show you their compost,
[04:22.980 --> 04:24.820]  thinking that it's amazing and it's
[04:24.940 --> 04:25.940]  incomplete.
[04:26.220 --> 04:28.020]  So like what what what's
[04:28.020 --> 04:29.860]  either missing or
[04:30.100 --> 04:31.940]  out of balance in an income?
[04:31.940 --> 04:33.660]  Like what do you what do
[04:33.660 --> 04:35.540]  you see in typical incomplete
[04:35.820 --> 04:36.700]  samples?
[04:36.700 --> 04:38.380]  And then what's the definition of
[04:38.380 --> 04:39.380]  complete?
[04:39.900 --> 04:41.820]  OK, so most compost
[04:41.820 --> 04:43.500]  is not necessarily made with the
[04:43.500 --> 04:45.060]  end goal of having a balance
[04:45.620 --> 04:47.260]  of microorganisms and what we would
[04:47.260 --> 04:49.100]  define as a balance or
[04:49.180 --> 04:50.900]  biologically complete in that is
[04:50.900 --> 04:51.940]  that it has to have a certain
[04:51.940 --> 04:53.700]  amount of bacteria,
[04:53.700 --> 04:55.060]  but not too much bacteria.
[04:55.060 --> 04:56.740]  So it's not overwhelmed with just
[04:56.740 --> 04:57.740]  bacteria.
[04:58.180 --> 04:59.340]  It has to have a certain amount of
[04:59.340 --> 05:00.980]  beneficial fungi in order for them
[05:00.980 --> 05:02.820]  to do their job and for it to
[05:02.820 --> 05:03.820]  benefit your garden.
[05:04.420 --> 05:05.820]  It also has to have a certain
[05:06.180 --> 05:07.180]  threshold of the
[05:08.060 --> 05:10.300]  protozoa, the higher
[05:10.300 --> 05:11.700]  level predators in the system.
[05:12.140 --> 05:13.140]  So typically that's
[05:13.940 --> 05:15.100]  at least 50,000.
[05:15.500 --> 05:16.740]  And then it has to have a certain
[05:16.740 --> 05:18.460]  level of nematodes, at least
[05:18.460 --> 05:20.060]  bacterial feeders, at least one of
[05:20.060 --> 05:20.940]  those.
[05:20.940 --> 05:22.700]  And and then it can't have any
[05:22.700 --> 05:23.700]  detriment as well.
[05:23.700 --> 05:25.740]  It can't have a certain level,
[05:25.900 --> 05:27.340]  I think, past like five percent of
[05:27.540 --> 05:28.540]  my seeds.
[05:29.060 --> 05:30.540]  It can't have ciliates and things
[05:30.540 --> 05:32.180]  like that. So they definitely met
[05:32.180 --> 05:33.940]  the goal with that.
[05:33.940 --> 05:35.540]  And we were absolutely thrilled
[05:35.540 --> 05:37.380]  because they've never once used
[05:37.380 --> 05:38.900]  our compost. It's all been their
[05:38.900 --> 05:39.500]  compost.
[05:39.500 --> 05:40.820]  So which is new,
[05:41.260 --> 05:42.060]  which is very new.
[05:42.060 --> 05:43.060]  Yeah, that's yeah.
[05:43.660 --> 05:44.780]  And we even started out the
[05:44.780 --> 05:46.380]  conversation like, you know, like,
[05:46.380 --> 05:47.580]  well, you know, if yours doesn't
[05:47.620 --> 05:48.900]  pan out, you know.
[05:48.940 --> 05:50.140]  So that's what we would define as
[05:50.140 --> 05:51.180]  biologically complete.
[05:51.180 --> 05:52.380]  It meets those minimums and all
[05:52.380 --> 05:53.660]  those categories so that you have a
[05:53.660 --> 05:55.060]  complete soil food web at the
[05:55.100 --> 05:56.420]  minimum numbers doing the work.
[05:56.780 --> 05:58.580]  Most compost, when they make it
[05:58.780 --> 06:00.660]  tend to be bacterial food
[06:00.660 --> 06:02.220]  heavy. And so lots of green
[06:02.220 --> 06:03.700]  material, maybe not balanced out
[06:03.700 --> 06:05.140]  with browns, hasn't aged long
[06:05.140 --> 06:06.820]  enough. So it tends to have a lot
[06:06.820 --> 06:08.540]  of bacteria and not so much of
[06:08.700 --> 06:09.700]  the other guys.
[06:09.940 --> 06:10.940]  Just, you know, people aren't
[06:10.940 --> 06:12.820]  necessarily measuring
[06:12.820 --> 06:13.580]  it like we do.
[06:13.580 --> 06:15.220]  And so it definitely
[06:15.820 --> 06:17.180]  helps guide our process as to
[06:17.500 --> 06:18.700]  what the end result is.
[06:18.700 --> 06:20.460]  And they were doing it all on their
[06:20.460 --> 06:21.820]  own. So, yeah.
[06:22.060 --> 06:23.060]  It's pretty exciting.
[06:23.060 --> 06:24.060]  Yeah.
[06:24.980 --> 06:25.980]  All right, Oklahoma
[06:26.980 --> 06:27.980]  farmers.
[06:29.100 --> 06:31.020]  So, first of all, Jacob, I just
[06:31.020 --> 06:33.180]  love the fact that to get to work
[06:33.380 --> 06:35.300]  on the farm, I think you just
[06:35.300 --> 06:36.940]  go out that that wood door behind
[06:37.260 --> 06:38.260]  you, right?
[06:38.780 --> 06:40.380]  Yeah. Yeah. So I'm here
[06:41.100 --> 06:42.980]  on the farm. It's on our
[06:42.980 --> 06:44.460]  homestead property here.
[06:45.220 --> 06:46.740]  We're on five acres in Sperry,
[06:46.740 --> 06:48.540]  Oklahoma, and we're
[06:48.980 --> 06:50.780]  growing in a 30 by
[06:50.780 --> 06:51.780]  30 garage, a 30
[06:52.620 --> 06:54.020]  by 30 building that we
[06:54.740 --> 06:55.740]  retrofitted
[06:57.060 --> 06:58.700]  after we
[06:59.140 --> 07:00.940]  after it became legal here
[07:00.940 --> 07:01.700]  in Oklahoma.
[07:01.700 --> 07:02.700]  We we both were one
[07:03.500 --> 07:04.780]  of the first few to
[07:06.380 --> 07:07.820]  to sign up to be patients.
[07:07.820 --> 07:09.260]  So we're patients as well.
[07:09.260 --> 07:10.940]  And then we grew our own
[07:11.420 --> 07:12.980]  there for a year and,
[07:13.780 --> 07:15.500]  you know, dabble here and there in
[07:15.500 --> 07:16.500]  different things.
[07:16.980 --> 07:18.420]  And then decided to go commercial.
[07:18.420 --> 07:20.260]  So but yeah, now I'm here
[07:20.260 --> 07:21.940]  on the farm and it's awesome.
[07:22.660 --> 07:23.860]  You know, that's part of part of
[07:23.860 --> 07:25.860]  free folk. Yeah, it's it's
[07:26.060 --> 07:27.220]  the Game of Thrones thing.
[07:27.220 --> 07:29.460]  It's it's being free of prohibition
[07:29.460 --> 07:31.420]  and it's free of the, you know,
[07:31.660 --> 07:32.620]  the nine to five.
[07:32.620 --> 07:34.860]  And it's and it's the opportunity
[07:34.860 --> 07:36.620]  to farm and
[07:36.620 --> 07:38.660]  do so and actually make a living
[07:38.660 --> 07:40.180]  that, you know, and that's kind of
[07:40.180 --> 07:42.340]  what cannabis is doing
[07:42.340 --> 07:43.340]  for Oklahoma and for
[07:44.100 --> 07:45.540]  small farmers like us.
[07:46.220 --> 07:48.140]  Yeah, and I love what's
[07:48.140 --> 07:49.820]  going on in Oklahoma and that
[07:49.820 --> 07:51.660]  everybody can just, you know,
[07:51.660 --> 07:53.620]  it's like I assume your
[07:53.620 --> 07:56.060]  capital expenditure is to
[07:56.420 --> 07:58.620]  turn your home into a functioning
[07:58.620 --> 07:59.580]  commercial farm.
[07:59.580 --> 08:01.740]  We're not I mean, in California,
[08:01.740 --> 08:03.300]  you got to do all sorts of stuff to
[08:03.300 --> 08:05.100]  be compliant and it's almost
[08:05.540 --> 08:06.540]  prohibitive.
[08:07.700 --> 08:10.060]  Oh, yeah. And the
[08:10.060 --> 08:12.020]  entry costs here are the barriers to
[08:12.020 --> 08:13.980]  entry are low, you
[08:13.980 --> 08:16.020]  know, as far as licensing and
[08:16.020 --> 08:17.020]  being, you know,
[08:17.860 --> 08:18.820]  getting all that done.
[08:18.820 --> 08:19.620]  It's not difficult.
[08:19.620 --> 08:21.940]  I mean, they made it very broad
[08:22.020 --> 08:23.780]  and but, you know, that
[08:23.780 --> 08:24.780]  that's good.
[08:24.780 --> 08:25.980]  Good sides and bad sides.
[08:25.980 --> 08:27.780]  I mean, it's it's good for
[08:27.780 --> 08:29.700]  the industry, but it's
[08:29.820 --> 08:30.820]  it's very competitive.
[08:30.820 --> 08:32.540]  You know, there's like six thousand
[08:32.540 --> 08:34.700]  growers in Oklahoma
[08:34.700 --> 08:36.300]  that are registered commercial
[08:36.300 --> 08:37.300]  growers.
[08:37.380 --> 08:39.380]  They're not all growing, but there's
[08:39.380 --> 08:40.380]  a lot of us.
[08:41.940 --> 08:43.580]  Well, yeah, go ahead.
[08:44.100 --> 08:44.580]  Sorry.
[08:44.580 --> 08:45.580]  No, no, go ahead.
[08:45.780 --> 08:46.660]  Well, I'll just say, man, we didn't
[08:46.660 --> 08:48.300]  get to like kind of thank you for
[08:48.300 --> 08:49.260]  letting us get on here, man.
[08:49.260 --> 08:50.780]  We we really appreciate this
[08:50.780 --> 08:52.660]  opportunity. I mean, Jason's
[08:52.660 --> 08:54.340]  a huge fan and I'm a fan like
[08:55.020 --> 08:56.780]  we this is
[08:57.100 --> 08:58.420]  Jason can kind of talk about it.
[08:58.460 --> 09:00.100]  We can cue to him and tell you kind
[09:00.100 --> 09:01.980]  of how we how we kind of found
[09:01.980 --> 09:03.340]  Scott and Sarah to this man.
[09:04.060 --> 09:06.060]  This is your program has been
[09:06.060 --> 09:07.700]  very helpful for us.
[09:09.180 --> 09:10.180]  Thank you. Yeah.
[09:10.220 --> 09:12.140]  Well, it's funny because I've always
[09:12.140 --> 09:13.300]  wanted to just lurk in the
[09:13.300 --> 09:14.700]  background and have people like
[09:14.700 --> 09:15.660]  Scott and Sarah.
[09:15.660 --> 09:16.860]  I keep telling Scott, like, can we
[09:16.860 --> 09:18.300]  do something weekly or at least
[09:18.300 --> 09:19.300]  recurring? So
[09:21.020 --> 09:22.300]  I appreciate it.
[09:22.340 --> 09:23.340]  But do you
[09:24.260 --> 09:25.460]  guys want to?
[09:26.540 --> 09:28.580]  Do you want to start with
[09:28.580 --> 09:30.460]  a tour of the composting stuff,
[09:30.460 --> 09:31.820]  since that's what we're just talking
[09:31.820 --> 09:33.620]  about, and then we can get into that
[09:33.620 --> 09:36.020]  and composting concepts
[09:36.020 --> 09:38.020]  and best practices.
[09:40.140 --> 09:41.580]  So let let me
[09:42.300 --> 09:43.300]  hold on.
[09:44.300 --> 09:45.500]  All right, I'm going to pull up your
[09:45.500 --> 09:46.500]  chickens.
[09:47.220 --> 09:48.700]  OK, so
[09:49.460 --> 09:50.460]  yeah.
[09:50.540 --> 09:51.900]  So, yeah, so I mean, just talking
[09:51.900 --> 09:53.620]  about composting, why you get that
[09:53.620 --> 09:54.740]  pulled up. I mean, we
[09:55.820 --> 09:57.700]  are here. Composting is relative.
[09:57.740 --> 09:59.980]  I mean, so your situation,
[10:00.020 --> 10:01.860]  I mean, it's so, yeah, we
[10:01.860 --> 10:03.740]  we had been gardening
[10:03.740 --> 10:04.740]  before
[10:05.620 --> 10:07.180]  I had been gardening.
[10:07.180 --> 10:08.700]  So, yeah, it's been really wet here.
[10:08.700 --> 10:10.300]  So it's kind of wet. But yeah, this
[10:10.300 --> 10:11.380]  is this is our chicken.
[10:11.420 --> 10:13.300]  So we've got 15
[10:14.060 --> 10:15.900]  chickens and the
[10:15.900 --> 10:18.060]  two coops. And then these
[10:18.060 --> 10:19.180]  are the piles that
[10:19.980 --> 10:21.940]  of compost that this is just
[10:21.940 --> 10:22.940]  a couple of days ago here.
[10:22.940 --> 10:24.820]  So, you know, it's wintertime, so
[10:24.820 --> 10:26.060]  there's not a lot of action
[10:27.500 --> 10:29.180]  in the pile, but there is stuff going
[10:29.180 --> 10:30.660]  on still and we are still getting
[10:30.660 --> 10:32.500]  green material, you know,
[10:32.540 --> 10:34.340]  from the cannabis operation, which
[10:34.380 --> 10:36.220]  is excellent for the winter.
[10:36.220 --> 10:37.540]  We're still getting green material.
[10:37.540 --> 10:39.500]  So this is just kind of we just
[10:39.500 --> 10:40.380]  want to hold right there.
[10:40.380 --> 10:41.300]  You can kind of see what we're
[10:41.300 --> 10:42.300]  working with. So.
[10:42.940 --> 10:44.340]  So, yeah, we had already kind of
[10:44.340 --> 10:46.340]  been composting.
[10:47.100 --> 10:48.500]  Sarah mentioned that we had been
[10:48.500 --> 10:50.060]  doing it and kind of this.
[10:50.180 --> 10:51.260]  There's a lot of different ways to
[10:51.260 --> 10:52.100]  compost.
[10:52.100 --> 10:53.860]  We would consider this to be
[10:54.780 --> 10:56.740]  a static pile and
[10:56.740 --> 10:57.980]  then kind of lasagna
[10:58.620 --> 11:00.580]  style is what what I call
[11:00.580 --> 11:02.140]  it. So basically what I'll do, what
[11:02.140 --> 11:03.700]  we'll do is just take the
[11:04.380 --> 11:05.900]  litter out of the chicken coop.
[11:06.300 --> 11:08.300]  You know, the chicken coop, you
[11:08.300 --> 11:09.980]  know, we change that out at least
[11:10.020 --> 11:11.980]  monthly, you know, maybe more often
[11:11.980 --> 11:13.180]  depending on how much they're eating
[11:13.180 --> 11:14.700]  and stuff. But, you know, we'll take
[11:14.700 --> 11:16.260]  that that litter out of it, out of
[11:16.260 --> 11:17.900]  the chicken coop. It's got the
[11:17.900 --> 11:19.780]  manure, the feathers and the straw.
[11:19.940 --> 11:21.420]  And so we'll add that in and we
[11:21.420 --> 11:23.140]  always mix it with something brown.
[11:23.180 --> 11:24.980]  So we'll something brown and
[11:24.980 --> 11:26.420]  something green. So depending on the
[11:26.420 --> 11:27.980]  time of year, you know, like right
[11:27.980 --> 11:29.820]  now, we've got some straw in there.
[11:29.820 --> 11:31.420]  We've got all the manure and
[11:31.420 --> 11:32.900]  feathers and then the cannabis
[11:32.900 --> 11:34.900]  leaves. And then, you know,
[11:34.940 --> 11:35.980]  another thing that we get from the
[11:35.980 --> 11:37.340]  property in the way that we
[11:38.060 --> 11:39.580]  kind of leverage the indigenous
[11:40.980 --> 11:42.740]  indigenous microorganisms is
[11:42.740 --> 11:44.300]  that, you know, there's a lot
[11:44.500 --> 11:45.700]  of trees here on the property.
[11:45.700 --> 11:46.700]  So we're heavily wooded.
[11:47.180 --> 11:48.660]  And so the leaves from those
[11:48.660 --> 11:49.900]  trees, you know, we'll rake those
[11:49.900 --> 11:51.740]  and pile them up and then we'll
[11:51.740 --> 11:52.900]  mix them in as we go.
[11:52.900 --> 11:54.940]  And so each layer, we
[11:55.300 --> 11:56.700]  try to make each layer as diverse
[11:56.700 --> 11:58.660]  as possible with what we have around
[11:58.660 --> 12:00.460]  at the time. And so, you know,
[12:00.820 --> 12:02.540]  it may be in the summertime, it
[12:02.540 --> 12:04.380]  may be long clippings, it may be,
[12:04.780 --> 12:06.660]  you know, leaves, but just
[12:06.660 --> 12:08.300]  as many things as possible, trying
[12:08.420 --> 12:09.980]  to get a good ratio of greens and
[12:09.980 --> 12:10.980]  browns.
[12:10.980 --> 12:12.900]  And yes, there's a pile of leaves.
[12:12.900 --> 12:14.340]  So we pile those up and let them
[12:14.340 --> 12:15.340]  start to break down.
[12:15.340 --> 12:16.420]  And that's where you get kind of
[12:16.420 --> 12:18.420]  your indigenous microbes
[12:18.420 --> 12:20.420]  that are in fungus and
[12:20.420 --> 12:21.980]  other organisms will be in
[12:22.300 --> 12:23.900]  that already kind of get,
[12:24.500 --> 12:26.580]  you know, working on the leaves
[12:26.580 --> 12:28.300]  already. So when we go to put those
[12:28.300 --> 12:29.780]  leaves in there, they're already
[12:29.780 --> 12:31.340]  partially decomposed.
[12:31.340 --> 12:33.020]  And so we just get a real good mix.
[12:33.020 --> 12:34.660]  And I think that's that's part of
[12:34.660 --> 12:35.860]  the reason why it works.
[12:35.860 --> 12:37.580]  And but also it's a good way to
[12:37.740 --> 12:39.060]  but also it's really slow.
[12:39.060 --> 12:41.460]  And so we're not in a hurry,
[12:41.660 --> 12:43.420]  you know, so like there's a way to
[12:43.420 --> 12:44.300]  do this fast.
[12:44.300 --> 12:46.020]  And the way that I'm doing it, that
[12:46.020 --> 12:47.380]  we're doing it here is not the
[12:47.380 --> 12:48.380]  fastest way to do it.
[12:48.820 --> 12:50.940]  But so we'll leave those layers
[12:50.940 --> 12:52.460]  like that. You saw I had two bins.
[12:52.460 --> 12:54.580]  So we'll just flip one over, flip
[12:54.580 --> 12:55.580]  it into the other bin.
[12:55.820 --> 12:56.940]  And then there's a turner.
[12:56.980 --> 12:59.260]  And so we'll just turn the final
[12:59.260 --> 13:01.180]  stage. We'll be turning it in
[13:01.180 --> 13:03.460]  that fifty five gallon turner
[13:03.620 --> 13:04.900]  and then it's done.
[13:04.900 --> 13:06.460]  And then we dump it into totes and
[13:06.460 --> 13:07.220]  we store it.
[13:07.220 --> 13:08.540]  And, you know, we've been working
[13:08.540 --> 13:09.580]  with Scott and Sarah on the best
[13:09.580 --> 13:11.780]  ways to do that and to keep
[13:12.220 --> 13:13.940]  keep that stuff as healthy as
[13:13.940 --> 13:15.420]  possible for as long as possible.
[13:15.900 --> 13:17.540]  And then, of course, you know,
[13:17.740 --> 13:19.260]  we thought our compost was great.
[13:19.860 --> 13:21.820]  We were really happy when
[13:21.820 --> 13:22.820]  they agreed with us.
[13:23.740 --> 13:25.460]  Yeah, so that's that's our
[13:25.460 --> 13:26.460]  composting.
[13:28.980 --> 13:30.740]  And then hold
[13:30.740 --> 13:32.380]  on, let me get the last one,
[13:33.020 --> 13:35.100]  which is the extract.
[13:35.100 --> 13:36.340]  So what what's.
[13:38.460 --> 13:39.700]  What's the process?
[13:41.220 --> 13:43.060]  Yeah, so there's another picture
[13:43.060 --> 13:44.060]  that I put there.
[13:44.500 --> 13:45.780]  So, yeah, Scott, Sarah taught us
[13:45.780 --> 13:47.860]  this. I mean, part and
[13:47.860 --> 13:48.820]  I don't want to talk too much,
[13:48.820 --> 13:49.820]  because, you know,
[13:52.140 --> 13:53.300]  you know, I'm sure they want to
[13:53.300 --> 13:54.300]  talk about extracting, too.
[13:54.340 --> 13:56.540]  But like, you know, so
[13:56.580 --> 13:57.860]  so part of the reason was like
[13:58.180 --> 13:59.540]  part of the reason we went to them
[13:59.540 --> 14:01.140]  and part of the reason why, you
[14:01.140 --> 14:02.220]  know, we found them through your
[14:02.220 --> 14:04.100]  show and just all that, you
[14:04.580 --> 14:06.300]  wanted to know how to use this
[14:06.300 --> 14:07.780]  compost in the most efficient way
[14:07.780 --> 14:09.540]  possible. And we know
[14:09.540 --> 14:10.700]  that if we're going to grow
[14:10.700 --> 14:12.500]  cannabis organically, that we need
[14:12.500 --> 14:14.140]  microbes in order to cycle
[14:14.140 --> 14:15.060]  nutrients.
[14:15.060 --> 14:16.740]  But if that is true,
[14:16.900 --> 14:18.820]  then what is the best
[14:18.820 --> 14:19.620]  way to do that?
[14:19.620 --> 14:20.980]  And so that's
[14:21.380 --> 14:23.220]  that's you know, we're constantly
[14:23.220 --> 14:24.820]  just trying to say, well, if
[14:25.020 --> 14:26.820]  it's true that you need microbes in
[14:26.820 --> 14:28.380]  order to grow organically and
[14:28.420 --> 14:30.060]  cycle nutrients, and if it's true
[14:30.060 --> 14:31.420]  that the soul food web needs to be
[14:31.420 --> 14:32.860]  functioning at the highest level in
[14:32.860 --> 14:34.220]  order to grow organic premium
[14:34.220 --> 14:36.180]  cannabis, then how
[14:36.180 --> 14:37.500]  do you do that in the most
[14:37.500 --> 14:39.260]  efficient way to be
[14:39.260 --> 14:41.860]  like, you know, commercial
[14:41.860 --> 14:43.460]  and viable in the industry?
[14:43.460 --> 14:45.020]  And these are the things that that
[14:45.020 --> 14:46.740]  Scott and Sarah offer us is that
[14:47.060 --> 14:48.060]  they look at.
[14:49.100 --> 14:50.660]  So they taught us the strategies,
[14:50.700 --> 14:51.860]  including extract.
[14:51.900 --> 14:53.780]  So, you know, extracting our
[14:53.780 --> 14:56.260]  compost and using it to supplement
[14:56.580 --> 14:58.340]  our biodiversity
[14:58.340 --> 14:59.340]  in our soil,
[15:00.060 --> 15:02.340]  you know, is extremely significant.
[15:02.340 --> 15:03.580]  And so what we're doing there is
[15:03.580 --> 15:05.540]  we're taking the compost at a
[15:05.540 --> 15:07.380]  ratio, you know,
[15:08.780 --> 15:10.580]  one pound to five
[15:10.580 --> 15:12.380]  gallons, something about like that.
[15:12.380 --> 15:14.060]  We're kind of open that a little bit
[15:14.060 --> 15:15.860]  lately, but putting it in a 400
[15:15.860 --> 15:17.780]  micron bag and then we
[15:17.780 --> 15:19.380]  dip that 400 micron bag,
[15:20.260 --> 15:22.060]  you know, into water, shake, you
[15:22.060 --> 15:23.140]  know, stir it around.
[15:24.380 --> 15:25.980]  You know, Sarah says to it like
[15:25.980 --> 15:27.180]  dirty socks, you know, we're just
[15:27.180 --> 15:28.820]  kind of like washing like you're
[15:28.820 --> 15:30.940]  washing the the compost
[15:30.940 --> 15:32.140]  into the water. So you're knocking
[15:32.140 --> 15:33.500]  all those microbes off all the
[15:33.500 --> 15:35.260]  fungus, the fungus
[15:35.260 --> 15:36.860]  and everything is getting knocked
[15:36.860 --> 15:38.140]  off into the water. And so then we
[15:38.500 --> 15:40.580]  we just dose our plants, our soil
[15:40.580 --> 15:42.420]  with that water on a regular basis.
[15:42.460 --> 15:43.460]  And and then we
[15:44.380 --> 15:46.220]  monitor that through Scott and
[15:46.220 --> 15:47.740]  Sarah to make sure that what we're
[15:47.740 --> 15:49.380]  doing is right, you know, and that
[15:49.380 --> 15:51.820]  it's working because that's
[15:52.100 --> 15:53.700]  that's the whole thing is like, you
[15:53.700 --> 15:55.100]  know, this industry, we got to we
[15:55.100 --> 15:56.380]  got to figure out why we're doing
[15:56.380 --> 15:57.380]  what we're doing
[15:58.500 --> 16:00.700]  and if what we're doing
[16:00.700 --> 16:02.500]  makes sense. And so there's a lot
[16:02.860 --> 16:04.060]  there's not a lot of
[16:04.700 --> 16:06.140]  that type of information out there.
[16:06.140 --> 16:07.820]  So, yeah, extract is
[16:07.820 --> 16:09.660]  just, you know, compost in
[16:09.660 --> 16:11.980]  water, good compost
[16:12.700 --> 16:14.860]  in water and then adding that
[16:16.020 --> 16:17.020]  to the situation.
[16:20.120 --> 16:21.440]  One thing I'd like to point out, if
[16:21.440 --> 16:23.320]  you noticed in that picture
[16:24.360 --> 16:26.280]  when he made that extract, all of
[16:26.280 --> 16:28.160]  those the brown
[16:28.480 --> 16:30.360]  material, I mean, it's just it's
[16:30.480 --> 16:32.040]  all about fulvic acid, all those
[16:32.360 --> 16:34.320]  omic acids and humic acids
[16:34.320 --> 16:36.160]  that they're biologically complete
[16:36.160 --> 16:38.240]  compost is making is right
[16:38.240 --> 16:40.480]  there in that cup, all the nutrients
[16:40.480 --> 16:41.560]  that it's been cycling and
[16:41.560 --> 16:43.560]  everything. So you can see it when
[16:43.560 --> 16:45.320]  it sits there. It's not separating
[16:45.320 --> 16:46.320]  or anything like that.
[16:46.440 --> 16:47.840]  It would take a while for it to.
[16:48.720 --> 16:50.400]  But you can see that pretty good in
[16:50.400 --> 16:52.280]  that picture. So if you have
[16:52.840 --> 16:54.800]  lower quality compost that doesn't
[16:54.800 --> 16:56.600]  have high organism activity when you
[16:56.600 --> 16:58.160]  shake it in water, normally it'll
[16:58.160 --> 16:59.360]  separate from the water
[16:59.920 --> 17:02.120]  or it'll be black and float
[17:02.720 --> 17:03.720]  or it'll sink.
[17:05.000 --> 17:06.000]  This doesn't want to meld with the
[17:06.000 --> 17:06.840]  water very well.
[17:06.840 --> 17:07.840]  Yeah.
[17:07.880 --> 17:09.360]  It's something about the
[17:10.200 --> 17:11.880]  organisms. And like Sarah said, all
[17:11.880 --> 17:13.640]  those humics and fulvic acids, it
[17:14.120 --> 17:15.800]  almost kind of stays suspended in the
[17:15.800 --> 17:16.800]  water.
[17:17.000 --> 17:18.160]  It's it's not
[17:19.080 --> 17:20.400]  if that is happening, it
[17:21.160 --> 17:22.400]  must be good compost.
[17:23.560 --> 17:25.000]  But you know that if it's
[17:25.480 --> 17:26.800]  not even close to the goal
[17:26.800 --> 17:28.160]  biologically complete, it won't
[17:28.240 --> 17:29.440]  behave like that in water.
[17:29.720 --> 17:31.640]  So you can put compost into a little
[17:31.640 --> 17:33.520]  bit of water and shake it.
[17:33.920 --> 17:35.080]  That's what I usually tell people to
[17:35.080 --> 17:36.240]  do when they're looking for local
[17:36.240 --> 17:37.240]  compost or trying to
[17:38.160 --> 17:39.640]  decide if it's worth doing
[17:39.640 --> 17:41.640]  microscope analysis of a compost
[17:41.680 --> 17:42.960]  when we go through the qualifying of
[17:42.960 --> 17:43.960]  input space.
[17:44.560 --> 17:45.920]  And the first thing I tell people to
[17:45.920 --> 17:47.480]  do is put one part compost, four
[17:47.720 --> 17:49.400]  parts water into any vessel.
[17:49.400 --> 17:50.880]  Take a test tube, take a water
[17:51.200 --> 17:52.720]  bottle, take a mason jar,
[17:53.400 --> 17:54.800]  you know, do those ratios and just
[17:54.800 --> 17:56.680]  gently shake it a few times and
[17:56.720 --> 17:57.720]  watch.
[17:57.720 --> 17:59.740]  Watch it. Does it does it look like
[17:59.760 --> 18:01.240]  it wants to integrate with the
[18:01.240 --> 18:02.240]  water?
[18:02.760 --> 18:03.760]  You know,
[18:07.280 --> 18:09.160]  I think Jason's joint knocked him
[18:09.160 --> 18:10.160]  out.
[18:10.200 --> 18:11.480]  He just fell off the table.
[18:13.880 --> 18:14.880]  That'd be hilarious.
[18:14.920 --> 18:16.600]  He smokes way too much for that to go
[18:16.600 --> 18:18.600]  down. But that's a funny thought
[18:18.600 --> 18:19.840]  that he just fell out of the chair.
[18:22.760 --> 18:24.680]  So on your sense, your
[18:24.680 --> 18:26.280]  your farms on your property, what
[18:26.880 --> 18:28.280]  kind of water are you using?
[18:30.440 --> 18:31.440]  Wait, let me unmute you.
[18:31.480 --> 18:32.480]  Hold on.
[18:32.800 --> 18:33.880]  You got to unmute yourself.
[18:34.440 --> 18:35.440]  Yeah.
[18:36.720 --> 18:37.720]  All right.
[18:37.920 --> 18:38.920]  Yeah. So, OK.
[18:39.200 --> 18:40.120]  So, yeah, water, man.
[18:40.120 --> 18:41.840]  Talk about talk about can of worms.
[18:41.880 --> 18:42.880]  Talk about water. So
[18:44.040 --> 18:45.720]  that was, you know, again, this is
[18:45.760 --> 18:46.760]  this is one of
[18:47.760 --> 18:49.800]  the problems that major problems
[18:49.800 --> 18:50.800]  that cultivators face.
[18:50.800 --> 18:51.800]  And I think that
[18:52.920 --> 18:54.440]  so so the answer to the question, I
[18:54.440 --> 18:56.500]  mean, I like going around around
[18:56.500 --> 18:58.180]  the back answering the question on
[18:58.180 --> 18:59.640]  the end. But so to answer the
[18:59.660 --> 19:00.860]  question, we're using tap water.
[19:01.020 --> 19:02.860]  So the reason why we're using
[19:02.860 --> 19:04.540]  tap water is because when we looked
[19:04.540 --> 19:05.540]  at this problem,
[19:06.700 --> 19:08.820]  you know, that's the most practical
[19:08.820 --> 19:09.820]  thing to do. And of
[19:10.700 --> 19:11.620]  course it is. Right.
[19:11.620 --> 19:13.300]  I mean, of course, using your tap
[19:13.300 --> 19:15.220]  water is so, you know, we
[19:15.220 --> 19:16.940]  tested our tap water several times.
[19:16.940 --> 19:19.060]  We've tested it to
[19:19.180 --> 19:21.220]  see what's in it and what
[19:21.220 --> 19:22.580]  the effect of that can be.
[19:22.580 --> 19:24.300]  We've you know, Scott and Sarah
[19:24.300 --> 19:26.100]  have assisted us in
[19:26.660 --> 19:28.800]  as far as looking at those tests
[19:28.820 --> 19:30.420]  and then determining, you know.
[19:31.860 --> 19:33.820]  What we can do with that
[19:34.380 --> 19:36.340]  to to ensure that it's not harming
[19:37.220 --> 19:38.820]  the microorganisms in our soil
[19:39.140 --> 19:41.140]  and then to ensure that, you
[19:41.140 --> 19:42.940]  know, that we're taking
[19:42.940 --> 19:45.020]  into account what's
[19:45.020 --> 19:46.800]  in the water. So that was
[19:46.800 --> 19:48.380]  one of our problems is, you know,
[19:48.940 --> 19:50.260]  when you don't know what you have
[19:50.260 --> 19:51.680]  and what you're what you're giving
[19:51.700 --> 19:53.480]  your plants, then how can you really
[19:53.500 --> 19:54.500]  expect
[19:55.500 --> 19:56.500]  you know, results?
[19:56.500 --> 19:58.200]  And so we just kept saying,
[19:58.220 --> 19:59.260]  you know, it's like, well, we need
[19:59.260 --> 20:00.260]  to figure out
[20:01.460 --> 20:03.140]  what we're working with here.
[20:03.340 --> 20:05.000]  And then once we figure out what
[20:05.020 --> 20:06.020]  we're working with,
[20:07.340 --> 20:09.120]  then we can develop a
[20:09.140 --> 20:10.460]  strategy using those tools.
[20:10.460 --> 20:12.540]  And so, yeah, our water
[20:12.820 --> 20:14.620]  is generally pretty good quality
[20:15.180 --> 20:16.860]  here in Oklahoma.
[20:16.860 --> 20:18.860]  So it didn't have any like major
[20:18.940 --> 20:20.440]  major concerns to begin with.
[20:20.460 --> 20:21.460]  But but yeah,
[20:22.220 --> 20:23.860]  we are treating it a little bit
[20:25.020 --> 20:26.260]  and then, you know, of course,
[20:27.220 --> 20:28.780]  you know, we're so yeah,
[20:29.340 --> 20:30.300]  we're using tap water.
[20:30.300 --> 20:31.300]  So what what what
[20:32.020 --> 20:33.940]  were some of the initial things
[20:33.940 --> 20:35.380]  you saw that you may be a little
[20:35.380 --> 20:36.220]  concerned about?
[20:36.220 --> 20:37.340]  Like, it seems like you didn't have
[20:37.340 --> 20:38.940]  a lot of chlorine or stuff like
[20:38.940 --> 20:40.940]  that. But what what did you have?
[20:40.940 --> 20:42.380]  And what what are the tactics you
[20:42.380 --> 20:43.380]  use to, I guess,
[20:44.140 --> 20:45.900]  remediate the tap water?
[20:46.060 --> 20:48.080]  And do you have like filters
[20:48.080 --> 20:49.080]  or?
[20:49.820 --> 20:51.500]  No, I mean, we're just kind of,
[20:52.340 --> 20:54.220]  you know, going with using
[20:54.220 --> 20:56.140]  some some fulvic acid and like,
[20:56.340 --> 20:57.900]  you know, we'll just add some
[20:57.900 --> 20:59.580]  fulvic acid to the water.
[21:01.100 --> 21:03.000]  But, you know, you ask about
[21:03.020 --> 21:04.840]  problems. I mean, so treated water
[21:04.860 --> 21:06.020]  has chloramine in it
[21:06.540 --> 21:07.940]  or chlorine, depending on I mean, I
[21:07.940 --> 21:09.000]  don't know if anyone still uses
[21:09.020 --> 21:10.660]  chlorine, but chloramine.
[21:10.660 --> 21:12.800]  So you just got to be mindful
[21:12.800 --> 21:14.740]  of that, you know, and
[21:14.740 --> 21:15.740]  sometimes.
[21:16.740 --> 21:17.660]  You know, the levels can be
[21:17.660 --> 21:19.400]  problematic, but our levels
[21:19.400 --> 21:21.500]  weren't and you can neutralize
[21:21.500 --> 21:22.740]  some of that. And so.
[21:23.500 --> 21:25.100]  But, you know, the point is, like.
[21:26.300 --> 21:27.860]  We can't you know, cannabis is
[21:27.860 --> 21:29.660]  special, right, special to all of
[21:29.660 --> 21:30.660]  us, but like.
[21:31.340 --> 21:32.820]  It's just a plant at the end of the
[21:32.820 --> 21:34.700]  day, like, you know, we
[21:34.700 --> 21:35.980]  got it, we got to understand that,
[21:35.980 --> 21:37.040]  you know, I've been growing we've
[21:37.040 --> 21:38.500]  been growing tomatoes
[21:39.140 --> 21:40.400]  using our tap water, we've been
[21:40.420 --> 21:42.220]  growing lettuce using our tap
[21:42.220 --> 21:43.880]  water, we've been farmers have been
[21:43.880 --> 21:45.840]  growing, you know, crops
[21:45.840 --> 21:47.780]  in the fields, spraying tap water
[21:47.780 --> 21:49.720]  on them. So so why is it that we
[21:49.720 --> 21:51.300]  think that that won't work for us?
[21:51.620 --> 21:52.980]  So that's kind of the problems that
[21:52.980 --> 21:54.780]  we were we were
[21:54.780 --> 21:56.180]  facing is like, you know, we want to
[21:56.180 --> 21:58.120]  be practical with what
[21:58.120 --> 21:59.900]  we're doing and we want things, you
[21:59.900 --> 22:01.820]  know, to to work.
[22:01.820 --> 22:03.860]  And so it worked.
[22:04.140 --> 22:05.600]  So what we're doing is working.
[22:05.620 --> 22:06.740]  It's not causing a problem.
[22:06.740 --> 22:08.660]  We're measuring what's in it.
[22:08.660 --> 22:11.000]  We're measuring accounting
[22:11.000 --> 22:12.220]  for it in our nutrients.
[22:12.220 --> 22:13.620]  So if there's calcium in the water,
[22:13.620 --> 22:14.620]  we've accounted for it,
[22:15.740 --> 22:17.640]  you know, and make sure that it's
[22:17.640 --> 22:19.340]  not going to throw anything out of
[22:19.340 --> 22:20.100]  whack.
[22:20.180 --> 22:21.520]  And so, you know, that's what we're
[22:21.540 --> 22:22.540]  doing. And
[22:23.700 --> 22:25.900]  so we think that can be replicated.
[22:25.900 --> 22:27.480]  And I mean, we don't again.
[22:27.500 --> 22:29.400]  I mean, it just blows
[22:29.400 --> 22:31.080]  our mind that like because,
[22:31.100 --> 22:32.820]  you know, yeah, I know it was
[22:32.820 --> 22:34.680]  important, but man, it sure
[22:34.680 --> 22:36.380]  is wasteful, you know, and
[22:37.140 --> 22:38.960]  and depending on if you're reclaiming
[22:38.980 --> 22:40.780]  any of that, you can waste a lot
[22:40.780 --> 22:41.780]  more.
[22:42.740 --> 22:44.560]  And everybody will be happy to know
[22:44.560 --> 22:46.140]  that Jason is back.
[22:48.300 --> 22:49.540]  He's shaking it off.
[22:50.540 --> 22:52.380]  As as far as water, one thing I
[22:52.380 --> 22:53.380]  wanted to say was.
[22:55.460 --> 22:57.480]  You know, my personal
[22:57.480 --> 22:59.560]  view of sustainability
[22:59.560 --> 23:01.180]  looks like a lot of different things,
[23:01.180 --> 23:03.060]  and it's kind of
[23:03.060 --> 23:05.560]  our personal strategy to make small
[23:05.560 --> 23:07.600]  incremental steps from a functional
[23:07.600 --> 23:09.660]  foundation that works
[23:09.660 --> 23:11.100]  and move forward from there.
[23:12.140 --> 23:13.460]  And so there's certain things that
[23:13.460 --> 23:15.180]  we do that other people might not
[23:15.180 --> 23:17.360]  consider sustainable, but we're also
[23:17.360 --> 23:18.540]  trying to make the business
[23:18.540 --> 23:19.780]  sustainable.
[23:19.820 --> 23:22.300]  And so keeping in business,
[23:22.300 --> 23:24.340]  finding consistency, having
[23:24.340 --> 23:25.880]  high quality that you can count on
[23:25.880 --> 23:27.220]  and having high potency that you can
[23:27.220 --> 23:28.420]  count on is really important.
[23:29.180 --> 23:30.960]  And so we
[23:30.980 --> 23:32.600]  do use some bottled products, things
[23:32.620 --> 23:34.380]  like that. And so where I try to
[23:34.380 --> 23:36.300]  really be sustainable is with water.
[23:37.540 --> 23:39.540]  I think far too many people
[23:39.540 --> 23:41.580]  just run to reverse osmosis water.
[23:42.980 --> 23:44.400]  You know where I come from in
[23:44.420 --> 23:46.260]  Southern California just so
[23:46.260 --> 23:48.540]  happens to have decent water
[23:48.540 --> 23:50.180]  out of the tap that if you just
[23:50.180 --> 23:52.220]  pH it, you could do hydroponics
[23:52.220 --> 23:53.940]  and you could add nutrients right to
[23:53.940 --> 23:55.820]  that tap water and pH
[23:55.820 --> 23:58.260]  it and grew great cannabis.
[23:58.260 --> 24:00.020]  And so it wasn't crazy to me that
[24:00.020 --> 24:02.140]  that was an option when I moved
[24:02.140 --> 24:03.720]  out of my regional area into a
[24:03.720 --> 24:04.720]  broader scope.
[24:04.720 --> 24:06.860]  And, you know,
[24:06.860 --> 24:08.680]  in other parts in Oklahoma, because
[24:08.700 --> 24:10.700]  of the farming, the water is
[24:10.700 --> 24:12.520]  atrocious. It really kind of kills
[24:12.540 --> 24:14.340]  plants. Other areas, it's quite nice
[24:14.340 --> 24:15.340]  because it's very rural.
[24:15.780 --> 24:17.340]  And a lot of times the city
[24:17.340 --> 24:19.420]  tap water isn't that bad because
[24:19.420 --> 24:21.500]  they have to deal with the calcium
[24:21.500 --> 24:23.540]  and magnesium ratios so that it
[24:23.540 --> 24:25.660]  doesn't destroy the pipes.
[24:25.660 --> 24:27.500]  And so taking that into
[24:27.500 --> 24:29.020]  account, I think is a part of
[24:29.020 --> 24:30.980]  sustainability because
[24:30.980 --> 24:32.900]  even a decent RO machine does
[24:32.900 --> 24:34.860]  like two to one, four
[24:34.860 --> 24:36.940]  to one, six to one type waste like,
[24:38.180 --> 24:40.340]  you know, living soil typically
[24:40.340 --> 24:42.100]  uses like one seventh of the volume
[24:42.100 --> 24:44.220]  of water that a cocoa facility
[24:45.180 --> 24:46.640]  would use. These are numbers that
[24:46.640 --> 24:49.100]  we've calculated doing
[24:49.100 --> 24:51.240]  conversions of very large farms,
[24:51.240 --> 24:52.920]  but something like one fifth to one
[24:52.920 --> 24:54.040]  seventh. So you already have
[24:54.040 --> 24:55.440]  something that's remarkably
[24:56.460 --> 24:58.000]  water respectful.
[24:58.000 --> 25:00.000]  So to then just jump to RO,
[25:00.000 --> 25:02.000]  I think is a lot of steps back.
[25:02.000 --> 25:03.520]  Having said that, sometimes we're
[25:03.520 --> 25:04.660]  forced into it.
[25:04.660 --> 25:06.560]  So in the situations
[25:06.560 --> 25:08.440]  where we have a water quality
[25:08.440 --> 25:10.100]  issue that we need to deal with,
[25:10.100 --> 25:11.360]  that can only be dealt with
[25:11.860 --> 25:14.340]  through RO, like sometimes
[25:14.340 --> 25:16.120]  heavy metals or other contaminants.
[25:16.120 --> 25:17.180]  You can only get them out through
[25:17.180 --> 25:19.720]  RO and then we have to use that.
[25:19.720 --> 25:21.580]  But I think, you know, it takes
[25:21.580 --> 25:22.580]  a little bit more math and
[25:22.580 --> 25:24.240]  sometimes the tap water chemistry
[25:24.240 --> 25:26.900]  gets a little interesting.
[25:26.900 --> 25:28.400]  And so sometimes it takes me two or
[25:28.400 --> 25:30.600]  three times to get the nutrient
[25:30.600 --> 25:32.580]  ratios correct for that source
[25:32.580 --> 25:35.120]  water to stay in suspension,
[25:35.120 --> 25:37.280]  to not precipitate out
[25:37.280 --> 25:38.960]  and to be balanced ultimately in
[25:38.960 --> 25:40.340]  the end goal. Sometimes it takes me
[25:40.340 --> 25:41.560]  a bit.
[25:41.560 --> 25:42.740]  RO, it's quite easy.
[25:42.740 --> 25:43.560]  Well, water, it's a little bit
[25:43.560 --> 25:45.600]  easier. Tap water sometimes
[25:45.600 --> 25:47.540]  is a little bit tricky, but.
[25:48.860 --> 25:50.200]  You know, I think what people don't
[25:50.200 --> 25:52.300]  realize is what that water makeup
[25:52.300 --> 25:54.120]  is will determine what
[25:54.120 --> 25:55.200]  nutrients you put into it.
[25:56.660 --> 25:58.700]  You know, some some
[25:58.700 --> 26:00.700]  waters have different ratios
[26:00.700 --> 26:02.120]  of calcium and magnesium, and that
[26:02.120 --> 26:03.760]  would sway your decision on using
[26:03.760 --> 26:05.600]  CalMag or using maybe
[26:05.600 --> 26:06.600]  Calboron.
[26:07.700 --> 26:09.520]  And so knowing those things
[26:09.520 --> 26:10.240]  are very important.
[26:10.240 --> 26:11.540]  Also in the commercial space to
[26:11.540 --> 26:13.080]  find consistency, most people don't
[26:13.080 --> 26:14.700]  know, but their water source changes
[26:14.700 --> 26:16.000]  throughout the year.
[26:16.000 --> 26:17.740]  And by looking at the water and
[26:17.740 --> 26:19.600]  taking analysis can get you
[26:19.600 --> 26:21.780]  one step ahead of
[26:21.780 --> 26:23.200]  a nutrient imbalance that's going to
[26:23.200 --> 26:25.060]  manifest later on, you know.
[26:25.060 --> 26:27.120]  So it's it's very important to
[26:28.220 --> 26:29.820]  know what your water source is and
[26:29.820 --> 26:30.980]  what you can do to work with it.
[26:35.110 --> 26:36.470]  So why don't we
[26:37.870 --> 26:39.710]  let's take a tour of the farm.
[26:39.710 --> 26:41.630]  So I think the first thing
[26:41.630 --> 26:43.470]  is to set the table with
[26:43.470 --> 26:44.970]  kind of the early days.
[26:44.970 --> 26:46.550]  Right. So I have some
[26:48.190 --> 26:50.230]  this is Jacob.
[26:50.230 --> 26:51.230]  That's you, right?
[26:52.370 --> 26:54.190]  What? Hold on, let me unmute you.
[26:54.190 --> 26:55.030]  Are you going to?
[26:55.030 --> 26:56.030]  There you go.
[26:56.030 --> 26:57.170]  Yeah, yeah, that's me, man.
[26:57.170 --> 26:59.510]  That's one of the many iterations
[26:59.510 --> 27:01.450]  of the square foot garden.
[27:01.450 --> 27:02.150]  So look at that.
[27:02.150 --> 27:04.710]  Look at that beard.
[27:04.710 --> 27:07.310]  Yeah, man, that was that was
[27:07.310 --> 27:09.010]  before I left the nine to five.
[27:09.010 --> 27:10.350]  So, you know, I'm still trying to
[27:10.350 --> 27:11.050]  look.
[27:11.050 --> 27:13.230]  So so you had I see some
[27:13.230 --> 27:15.290]  shard outside.
[27:15.290 --> 27:16.810]  So you're growing all sorts of stuff
[27:16.810 --> 27:17.650]  outside.
[27:17.650 --> 27:19.150]  And then this is kind of the home
[27:19.150 --> 27:20.550]  grow, right?
[27:20.550 --> 27:22.350]  Yeah, yeah. This was so, yeah,
[27:22.350 --> 27:24.310]  Jason and I kind of
[27:24.310 --> 27:26.530]  did, you know,
[27:26.530 --> 27:28.570]  combined our our
[27:28.570 --> 27:30.690]  wisdom and and
[27:30.690 --> 27:32.670]  started home growing kind
[27:32.670 --> 27:33.850]  of together.
[27:33.850 --> 27:35.670]  But just in this four by four tent
[27:35.670 --> 27:38.210]  in the same shop that we retrofitted
[27:39.210 --> 27:41.270]  to for our growth space now.
[27:41.270 --> 27:42.550]  So, yeah, yeah.
[27:42.550 --> 27:44.310]  So, you know, the square foot garden,
[27:44.310 --> 27:46.190]  you know, Jason and I both did square
[27:46.190 --> 27:47.450]  foot gardening.
[27:47.450 --> 27:48.610]  You know, I did it.
[27:48.610 --> 27:49.950]  And that's the reason why I started
[27:49.950 --> 27:52.230]  making compost, because for anyone
[27:52.230 --> 27:53.170]  that's familiar with square foot
[27:53.190 --> 27:56.490]  gardening, Mel Bartholomew,
[27:56.490 --> 27:58.250]  you know, has done a lot for like,
[27:58.250 --> 27:59.730]  you know, efficiency and gardening.
[27:59.750 --> 28:01.930]  And he's just
[28:01.950 --> 28:03.550]  all about making your own compost.
[28:03.550 --> 28:05.030]  And so that's why I started making
[28:05.030 --> 28:06.870]  compost was in order to
[28:06.870 --> 28:08.970]  to to work
[28:08.970 --> 28:10.610]  that program and try to make that
[28:10.610 --> 28:12.330]  work. And so, yeah, so
[28:12.330 --> 28:15.030]  so we we still grow vegetables.
[28:15.030 --> 28:17.690]  But yeah, we grow perennials
[28:17.690 --> 28:19.750]  and plants and, you know,
[28:19.750 --> 28:20.870]  we got bees on the farm.
[28:20.890 --> 28:22.950]  So we do, you
[28:22.950 --> 28:25.350]  know, plant for pollinators
[28:25.350 --> 28:26.950]  and do flowers and
[28:27.970 --> 28:29.010]  and things like that as well.
[28:29.010 --> 28:30.750]  So there's a lot a lot more going on
[28:30.750 --> 28:31.750]  than just cannabis.
[28:32.690 --> 28:34.770]  OK, and then
[28:35.350 --> 28:37.250]  this so you guys built
[28:37.250 --> 28:39.150]  out this screen, you guys built
[28:39.150 --> 28:40.150]  out this greenhouse.
[28:43.530 --> 28:44.710]  Yeah, Jason, you know, it's all about
[28:44.710 --> 28:45.710]  the greenhouse.
[28:46.370 --> 28:47.610]  And you got to unmute yourself.
[28:53.260 --> 28:54.680]  Or let me there we go, you're on
[28:54.680 --> 28:55.860]  me. OK, thank you.
[28:57.900 --> 28:58.900]  Yeah, so
[29:00.140 --> 29:02.200]  like Jacob said, been a
[29:02.220 --> 29:05.320]  gigantic fan of the show
[29:05.320 --> 29:07.560]  and listen to Kevin
[29:07.560 --> 29:10.340]  repeatedly say organic
[29:10.340 --> 29:12.380]  light is the best tasting herb
[29:12.380 --> 29:13.700]  you can get.
[29:13.700 --> 29:16.160]  And and so learning that,
[29:16.160 --> 29:17.840]  you know, we've started looking
[29:17.860 --> 29:19.780]  online of, you know,
[29:19.780 --> 29:21.140]  what's the best greenhouse?
[29:21.140 --> 29:22.740]  What's the what's the best way to do
[29:22.740 --> 29:25.180]  it? And just
[29:25.180 --> 29:27.740]  very quickly kind of ordered
[29:27.740 --> 29:29.020]  these light up kids.
[29:30.980 --> 29:33.060]  They get delivered and
[29:33.060 --> 29:34.460]  we just start building them
[29:34.460 --> 29:36.300]  ourselves by hand.
[29:36.320 --> 29:37.320]  And
[29:38.360 --> 29:39.900]  we've done everything on this.
[29:39.900 --> 29:41.480]  We've done we've done the wiring,
[29:41.480 --> 29:43.620]  the lights, the the evaporative
[29:43.620 --> 29:45.700]  cooling wall and have
[29:45.720 --> 29:47.820]  to give a shout out to Randy
[29:47.820 --> 29:49.940]  because he's been
[29:49.940 --> 29:51.940]  just a massive help.
[29:51.940 --> 29:54.000]  He's built basically
[29:54.000 --> 29:55.340]  every piece of this.
[29:55.360 --> 29:56.920]  That's Jacob's brother
[29:56.920 --> 29:58.800]  and father in law.
[29:59.880 --> 30:01.640]  And we've moved every
[30:01.640 --> 30:03.100]  every bit of soil in here by
[30:03.120 --> 30:04.120]  ourselves.
[30:04.820 --> 30:07.660]  I'm five gallon buckets
[30:07.660 --> 30:09.620]  and we just can't wait
[30:09.620 --> 30:12.500]  to get plants moved in there.
[30:12.500 --> 30:14.380]  So those are those are 20 by 50
[30:14.380 --> 30:16.380]  and they're that one greenhouse
[30:16.380 --> 30:17.140]  is 20 by 50.
[30:17.140 --> 30:19.620]  We have another that's pretty large.
[30:19.620 --> 30:21.500]  And so, you
[30:21.500 --> 30:23.320]  know, this is
[30:23.320 --> 30:25.620]  kind of your your climate
[30:25.620 --> 30:27.640]  control kind of we've got
[30:27.640 --> 30:29.660]  the evaporative cooler in the back.
[30:29.660 --> 30:30.940]  There's powered louvers.
[30:30.940 --> 30:33.340]  You've got the powered ventilation
[30:33.400 --> 30:35.020]  and then we've got our
[30:35.020 --> 30:37.180]  Vita lights there and circulation
[30:37.180 --> 30:39.180]  fans. And so this is it as it was
[30:39.180 --> 30:40.560]  yesterday. And so we're just we're
[30:40.560 --> 30:41.560]  getting to the point where we're
[30:41.560 --> 30:43.140]  going to plant this thing.
[30:43.140 --> 30:44.080]  We're still testing out the
[30:44.080 --> 30:45.060]  environment, trying to get that
[30:45.080 --> 30:47.280]  controller figured out.
[30:47.280 --> 30:48.880]  But yeah, you know, we had the
[30:48.880 --> 30:50.820]  contractor come in and do that,
[30:50.840 --> 30:52.200]  you know, the basic site work.
[30:52.200 --> 30:54.120]  But everything else we've done
[30:54.120 --> 30:55.920]  ourselves and we've been working
[30:55.920 --> 30:57.340]  on for a long time.
[30:57.340 --> 30:59.040]  And so with with the help
[30:59.040 --> 31:01.060]  of my father in law and Jason,
[31:01.060 --> 31:02.540]  we figured out, you know, we've
[31:02.540 --> 31:05.540]  become plumbers, electricians
[31:05.540 --> 31:07.520]  and, you know, cannabis
[31:07.520 --> 31:09.500]  growers all in the same
[31:09.500 --> 31:10.960]  commercial cannabis all in the same
[31:10.960 --> 31:12.800]  year. It's been really intense,
[31:12.800 --> 31:14.940]  but extremely challenging
[31:14.940 --> 31:15.940]  and rewarding.
[31:17.280 --> 31:19.120]  And then it looks like you have
[31:19.120 --> 31:21.000]  indoor space as well, is that
[31:21.000 --> 31:22.000]  correct?
[31:22.840 --> 31:24.040]  Yeah, that's our main that's our
[31:24.040 --> 31:25.460]  main deal now.
[31:25.460 --> 31:27.120]  Right now, that's that's where the
[31:27.120 --> 31:28.160]  magic's happening. So
[31:29.560 --> 31:31.520]  our indoor grow is a 30
[31:31.520 --> 31:33.600]  by 30 and we got a little
[31:33.600 --> 31:34.980]  tour of that that Jason can walk
[31:34.980 --> 31:35.980]  you through.
[31:37.640 --> 31:40.280]  So I would say this is
[31:40.280 --> 31:42.200]  our testing ground for what is
[31:42.200 --> 31:44.180]  going to be in our
[31:44.180 --> 31:46.000]  light greenhouses.
[31:46.000 --> 31:48.100]  And this
[31:48.100 --> 31:49.880]  started out as,
[31:49.880 --> 31:51.820]  hey, we want to get we just
[31:51.820 --> 31:52.940]  we just got our commercial
[31:52.940 --> 31:54.120]  license.
[31:54.120 --> 31:55.500]  We said, hey, we want to start
[31:55.500 --> 31:57.320]  growing immediately, even though
[31:57.320 --> 31:59.220]  we don't have our greenhouses.
[31:59.220 --> 32:00.840]  Let's just do something small in
[32:00.840 --> 32:02.120]  the shop.
[32:02.120 --> 32:04.320]  And and Jacob was
[32:04.320 --> 32:06.140]  very reluctant at first
[32:06.140 --> 32:07.740]  and was just like, OK, maybe we can
[32:07.740 --> 32:09.840]  do one table, a couple
[32:09.840 --> 32:11.820]  of lights and but
[32:11.820 --> 32:13.560]  we need to focus on the greenhouses.
[32:14.880 --> 32:15.880]  And
[32:17.000 --> 32:18.880]  then I get pen and paper out
[32:18.880 --> 32:20.580]  and I say, well, we can actually
[32:20.580 --> 32:22.560]  fit nine racks in here
[32:22.560 --> 32:24.380]  and we can also have a mother
[32:24.380 --> 32:26.000]  tent in here
[32:26.000 --> 32:27.520]  and we can have a clone tent in
[32:27.520 --> 32:28.520]  here and
[32:28.600 --> 32:31.500]  and kind of really
[32:31.500 --> 32:33.460]  pulled his arm and and
[32:33.460 --> 32:35.240]  convinced him to letting us
[32:35.240 --> 32:37.200]  go a little bigger than he
[32:37.200 --> 32:38.780]  kind of originally wanted to.
[32:40.160 --> 32:42.900]  And I'm thankful that he,
[32:42.900 --> 32:44.860]  you know, went with it
[32:44.860 --> 32:47.320]  and is really
[32:47.320 --> 32:49.400]  just on the ground, killing it
[32:49.400 --> 32:50.580]  every single day.
[32:50.580 --> 32:52.280]  And, you know, he
[32:52.280 --> 32:54.580]  talks about Free Folk Farm
[32:54.580 --> 32:56.780]  being the idea
[32:56.780 --> 32:58.500]  that we're we're free from the nine
[32:58.500 --> 32:59.500]  to five.
[32:59.500 --> 33:01.500]  But really, we just
[33:01.500 --> 33:03.640]  signed ourselves up for pager
[33:03.640 --> 33:05.320]  duty and
[33:07.280 --> 33:09.720]  at any given time, this disaster
[33:09.720 --> 33:11.820]  could strike, you know, via a flood
[33:11.820 --> 33:13.620]  or a fire or
[33:16.000 --> 33:18.080]  the power goes out or
[33:18.080 --> 33:20.120]  any any single thing could happen.
[33:20.120 --> 33:22.320]  And Jacob's kind of
[33:22.320 --> 33:23.740]  there on the ground,
[33:25.160 --> 33:26.920]  making sure that things are running
[33:26.920 --> 33:28.260]  smooth.
[33:28.280 --> 33:29.680]  And so.
[33:31.200 --> 33:32.420]  Yeah, so we can talk about those
[33:32.440 --> 33:34.680]  beds and stuff, Peter,
[33:34.680 --> 33:35.600]  pull that up a little bit.
[33:35.600 --> 33:37.620]  So, yeah, so, you know, kind
[33:37.620 --> 33:39.740]  of what we're doing, it's
[33:39.740 --> 33:40.680]  similar to what we had in the green
[33:40.680 --> 33:42.620]  house, like Jason said,
[33:42.620 --> 33:44.540]  you know, we we
[33:44.540 --> 33:46.300]  you know, we're glad we did this
[33:46.320 --> 33:48.240]  because, you know, part
[33:48.240 --> 33:50.900]  part of the market's kind of
[33:50.900 --> 33:53.060]  tough right now.
[33:53.060 --> 33:54.820]  And so having like some real solid
[33:54.840 --> 33:56.760]  indoor is what's really got us
[33:56.760 --> 33:58.800]  by and then working, being
[33:58.800 --> 34:01.160]  able to have this laboratory
[34:01.160 --> 34:03.040]  to learn from Scott and Sarah has
[34:03.040 --> 34:04.720]  been extremely valuable.
[34:04.720 --> 34:06.620]  I I truly don't
[34:06.620 --> 34:08.560]  believe that we'd be here today if
[34:08.560 --> 34:09.880]  we hadn't done this and if we
[34:09.880 --> 34:11.440]  hadn't learned, you know, set this
[34:11.440 --> 34:13.160]  up, working with Scott and
[34:13.160 --> 34:15.140]  Sarah and been able to
[34:15.140 --> 34:16.780]  kind of work through all the
[34:16.780 --> 34:17.780]  problems that
[34:18.700 --> 34:19.840]  that we found, because, I mean,
[34:19.860 --> 34:21.440]  it's just one problem after the
[34:21.440 --> 34:22.900]  next one. You grow cannabis and
[34:22.900 --> 34:24.600]  everybody out there knows that.
[34:24.600 --> 34:25.980]  And it's not easy.
[34:25.980 --> 34:27.860]  And so, yeah, so in there
[34:27.860 --> 34:29.700]  we've got those, you know, we've
[34:29.700 --> 34:31.460]  got 18 lights, 600
[34:31.460 --> 34:33.900]  watt LED panels.
[34:33.900 --> 34:35.940]  We've got our beds
[34:35.940 --> 34:38.240]  are on four by eight racks
[34:38.240 --> 34:40.260]  that we we did all the work
[34:40.260 --> 34:42.340]  in here ourselves to four
[34:42.340 --> 34:43.700]  by eight racks. And we've got our
[34:43.700 --> 34:45.180]  beds are a little smaller than that.
[34:45.180 --> 34:47.000]  They're thirty eight by eighty six
[34:47.020 --> 34:47.680]  by eighteen.
[34:47.680 --> 34:49.260]  They're the living soil fabric pots
[34:49.260 --> 34:50.220]  beds.
[34:50.220 --> 34:51.660]  You can kind of see our blue mat
[34:51.660 --> 34:53.780]  system plumbing
[34:53.780 --> 34:55.820]  running down the left side of
[34:56.020 --> 34:57.540]  the bed there.
[34:57.540 --> 34:59.600]  And Scott and Sarah helped us
[34:59.600 --> 35:01.520]  design that and guided us
[35:01.520 --> 35:03.420]  through installing that properly.
[35:03.420 --> 35:04.820]  And yeah, so that's been in for a
[35:04.820 --> 35:07.100]  little while. That's helping a lot.
[35:07.100 --> 35:09.740]  And so we're running two different
[35:09.740 --> 35:11.900]  varieties in here right now.
[35:11.900 --> 35:15.020]  We had grown up to eight before.
[35:15.020 --> 35:16.860]  Right now we've got
[35:16.860 --> 35:18.540]  strawberries and cream on that rack
[35:18.540 --> 35:20.700]  closest to us on those three racks.
[35:20.700 --> 35:21.980]  Those all strawberries and cream.
[35:21.980 --> 35:23.800]  Then the three racks on the back
[35:23.800 --> 35:26.180]  in there is all Morning Steep.
[35:26.180 --> 35:27.900]  And so these are these are varieties
[35:27.900 --> 35:30.160]  that, you know, we've
[35:30.160 --> 35:31.800]  kind of been growing to kind of talk
[35:31.800 --> 35:34.360]  about why we've selected those
[35:34.360 --> 35:35.720]  varieties at this point.
[35:35.720 --> 35:37.280]  But yeah, we've grown up to eight.
[35:37.280 --> 35:39.100]  We grew up to eight different
[35:39.100 --> 35:41.320]  cultivars in this space at the same
[35:41.320 --> 35:43.920]  time, which is also challenging
[35:43.920 --> 35:45.580]  because of the different structures
[35:45.580 --> 35:46.800]  and canopies and different.
[35:52.770 --> 35:54.670]  Yeah, do you want to why?
[35:54.670 --> 35:55.830]  Well, we could go in a couple of
[35:55.830 --> 35:57.350]  directions. I could cue up the blue
[35:57.350 --> 35:59.570]  mat video or we could talk
[35:59.570 --> 36:01.950]  about cultivars selection, which
[36:03.230 --> 36:04.830]  which direction you guys want to go in.
[36:04.830 --> 36:07.030]  Well, real quick, real
[36:07.030 --> 36:08.730]  quick, I was hoping that maybe we
[36:08.730 --> 36:10.410]  could do a demonstration with the
[36:10.410 --> 36:12.410]  compost, because I thought
[36:12.410 --> 36:14.750]  Sarah pointing out that
[36:14.750 --> 36:16.790]  our compost out at the
[36:16.790 --> 36:18.830]  farm, the extract was
[36:18.830 --> 36:20.550]  really dark and rich.
[36:20.550 --> 36:22.690]  And here at home, I just
[36:22.690 --> 36:24.630]  experiment in little five
[36:24.650 --> 36:27.150]  and a half inch pots and
[36:27.150 --> 36:28.510]  picked up what is usually
[36:28.510 --> 36:30.470]  recommended that most people
[36:30.470 --> 36:31.790]  can get.
[36:31.790 --> 36:32.790]  And that is
[36:34.630 --> 36:35.990]  the Malibu compost.
[36:37.050 --> 36:39.030]  And so whatever he was saying
[36:39.030 --> 36:40.810]  that, hey, we could do, you
[36:40.810 --> 36:42.470]  know, four parts water, one part
[36:42.470 --> 36:44.490]  compost. I thought, you know,
[36:44.490 --> 36:46.690]  let's go ahead and do that on air.
[36:48.270 --> 36:50.790]  And so usually
[36:50.790 --> 36:52.790]  we extract only
[36:52.790 --> 36:54.950]  for a couple of minutes,
[36:54.950 --> 36:57.030]  and I could do that now
[36:57.030 --> 36:59.770]  and I could show you how
[36:59.770 --> 37:01.670]  dark it is compared to the other.
[37:03.390 --> 37:05.310]  I fully support your idea.
[37:05.310 --> 37:06.270]  OK, awesome.
[37:06.270 --> 37:07.390]  So here we go.
[37:09.990 --> 37:10.990]  And, you know,
[37:12.190 --> 37:13.830]  we can talk about the blue mat or
[37:13.830 --> 37:14.830]  something.
[37:15.590 --> 37:16.590]  But
[37:21.000 --> 37:23.080]  can you aim your camera down a tiny
[37:23.080 --> 37:24.080]  bit?
[37:25.120 --> 37:26.480]  I already can hold that up.
[37:26.480 --> 37:27.480]  Yeah.
[37:28.160 --> 37:29.160]  There we go. Yeah.
[37:32.280 --> 37:33.280]  Very nice.
[37:35.200 --> 37:36.200]  Hopefully I don't spill on my
[37:36.200 --> 37:37.200]  keyboard here.
[37:37.800 --> 37:39.560]  It's going to get messy here.
[37:48.120 --> 37:49.720]  I also did not anticipate
[37:49.720 --> 37:51.680]  panning down, so nobody
[37:51.680 --> 37:53.160]  look at my couch over there.
[37:59.550 --> 38:00.750]  Yeah, it's going to have to settle
[38:00.750 --> 38:01.750]  for a minute, probably.
[38:03.390 --> 38:04.390]  All right.
[38:10.580 --> 38:11.580]  Well, go
[38:11.860 --> 38:12.860]  ahead and
[38:13.860 --> 38:15.380]  tell them about the morning steeper
[38:15.380 --> 38:16.900]  why we, you know, so
[38:16.900 --> 38:18.580]  so, yeah, cultivars wise, I mean,
[38:18.580 --> 38:20.420]  we can kind of we can go over to me
[38:20.420 --> 38:21.660]  and just kind of wait on that.
[38:23.820 --> 38:24.820]  We will come back
[38:27.140 --> 38:28.140]  to Jason.
[38:28.140 --> 38:29.580]  Take a scoop with a little glass,
[38:29.580 --> 38:30.740]  maybe so they can see it.
[38:32.380 --> 38:33.380]  Yeah, so I was going to wait.
[38:33.380 --> 38:34.580]  I was going to wait about a minute
[38:34.580 --> 38:35.580]  and then I'll come back.
[38:35.580 --> 38:36.580]  So I was going to wait.
[38:36.580 --> 38:37.660]  I was going to wait about a minute
[38:37.660 --> 38:39.820]  and a half and then I'll show you.
[38:40.900 --> 38:41.900]  Kind of
[38:42.660 --> 38:44.220]  yeah, what people
[38:44.500 --> 38:46.060]  generally would run into
[38:46.540 --> 38:47.820]  while extracting.
[38:51.020 --> 38:52.500]  If this stuff did not make small.
[38:55.820 --> 38:56.820]  Yeah, so.
[38:57.500 --> 38:58.500]  We.
[38:59.420 --> 39:00.580]  You know, the extracts, you know,
[39:00.900 --> 39:02.340]  living still, I mean, it's like,
[39:02.500 --> 39:03.500]  you know, we try to
[39:04.900 --> 39:06.340]  figure out what that means to us,
[39:06.500 --> 39:07.980]  because living still is just so.
[39:10.140 --> 39:11.540]  Kind of, you know, somebody can be
[39:11.540 --> 39:13.300]  in a five gallon pot and
[39:13.540 --> 39:15.540]  we were we were there and
[39:15.580 --> 39:17.460]  and you can be in a five gallon pot
[39:17.460 --> 39:19.100]  growing in soil and using organic
[39:19.100 --> 39:20.700]  methods, but
[39:21.020 --> 39:22.020]  there's a certain
[39:23.460 --> 39:25.140]  amount of biodiversity
[39:25.140 --> 39:26.340]  that needs to be there in order to
[39:26.340 --> 39:27.180]  make all this work.
[39:27.180 --> 39:28.340]  And that's why we went with the
[39:28.340 --> 39:29.340]  bigger beds and went
[39:30.300 --> 39:32.180]  with the full full living soil
[39:32.180 --> 39:34.140]  beds is that we really wanted
[39:34.140 --> 39:35.460]  everything to be as
[39:37.140 --> 39:39.140]  you know, conducive to
[39:39.140 --> 39:41.620]  microbial success
[39:41.620 --> 39:42.820]  as possible. And that's kind of what
[39:42.820 --> 39:44.220]  living still is to us is just kind of
[39:44.220 --> 39:46.220]  making sure that the things
[39:46.220 --> 39:48.180]  that we're doing, you know.
[39:50.540 --> 39:52.300]  Improve the soil
[39:52.580 --> 39:54.860]  quality and the microorganisms
[39:54.860 --> 39:56.580]  in the soil and so extracting is a
[39:56.580 --> 39:57.580]  huge part of that.
[39:59.300 --> 40:01.260]  And we really need the dramatic
[40:01.260 --> 40:02.260]  suspense music while
[40:03.140 --> 40:04.260]  we watch this water.
[40:04.700 --> 40:05.700]  You did
[40:06.220 --> 40:07.860]  get a scoop of it in that in that
[40:07.860 --> 40:08.860]  beaker and let it
[40:09.580 --> 40:10.580]  queue up.
[40:11.780 --> 40:14.180]  So I think we should ask the experts
[40:14.180 --> 40:16.260]  if if we've fully
[40:16.260 --> 40:17.980]  extracted this compost yet.
[40:19.980 --> 40:20.980]  I think you're good.
[40:21.780 --> 40:23.140]  Yeah, we need this guy in the Sarah
[40:23.140 --> 40:24.140]  color commentary.
[40:24.140 --> 40:25.740]  I think Tony Romo.
[40:25.780 --> 40:26.780]  There we go.
[40:27.380 --> 40:28.380]  So.
[40:34.660 --> 40:35.860]  All right, now we're doing
[40:36.860 --> 40:38.100]  riveting television
[40:38.900 --> 40:39.900]  coming to you.
[40:41.220 --> 40:42.940]  All right. You tell me when we're
[40:42.940 --> 40:44.180]  ready for production.
[40:44.860 --> 40:45.860]  I think you did.
[40:46.140 --> 40:47.380]  You probably extracted now.
[40:48.020 --> 40:49.020]  We've extracted.
[40:49.020 --> 40:50.260]  OK, I think.
[40:50.260 --> 40:51.260]  Yeah, I think you did it.
[40:51.620 --> 40:53.460]  So now should I scoop
[40:53.460 --> 40:55.100]  all the way to the bottom of the
[40:55.140 --> 40:57.300]  bowl or just kind of skim the top
[40:57.300 --> 40:59.180]  or where you guys think I should go
[40:59.180 --> 40:59.900]  with the flow?
[40:59.900 --> 41:01.020]  Either way. Just go where you're
[41:01.020 --> 41:02.020]  going.
[41:02.820 --> 41:03.820]  Leads you.
[41:04.020 --> 41:05.780]  I think to make it fair,
[41:06.220 --> 41:07.220]  all of
[41:07.820 --> 41:09.420]  you stir it really
[41:09.420 --> 41:10.660]  fast and then get a scoop.
[41:12.700 --> 41:13.700]  Sounds great.
[41:17.580 --> 41:18.580]  Here we go.
[41:19.860 --> 41:21.380]  Are you guys ready for the close up?
[41:23.020 --> 41:24.660]  We are. This is the money shot.
[41:24.900 --> 41:25.900]  This is what most
[41:26.580 --> 41:28.020]  people could go to the store and
[41:28.020 --> 41:29.500]  buy an extract and put
[41:29.980 --> 41:31.580]  on their organic stuff.
[41:33.300 --> 41:38.150]  Yeah, it looks pretty different.
[41:40.630 --> 41:42.270]  And when I took that picture of
[41:42.270 --> 41:43.550]  that beaker, that had been a while
[41:43.550 --> 41:45.110]  since I'd done that extract, by the
[41:45.110 --> 41:45.950]  way.
[41:45.950 --> 41:46.950]  Do you have your compost there?
[41:49.070 --> 41:50.590]  No, I mean, I've got it out.
[41:50.670 --> 41:52.190]  I could walk outside and grab some.
[41:54.230 --> 41:55.550]  I think that now we just got the
[41:55.550 --> 41:56.550]  picture basically.
[41:57.510 --> 41:58.510]  But it does look a lot different.
[41:59.670 --> 42:01.110]  Yeah, I just love that you
[42:01.110 --> 42:02.430]  pointed that out, Sarah.
[42:03.190 --> 42:04.190]  Yeah.
[42:04.510 --> 42:06.790]  Sarah is like a micro detective.
[42:06.950 --> 42:07.950]  It's amazing.
[42:08.430 --> 42:09.990]  Like she knows what's going on
[42:09.990 --> 42:11.670]  before we do just by looking at
[42:11.910 --> 42:12.910]  at the soil.
[42:13.070 --> 42:15.110]  You know, she's it's impressive.
[42:15.150 --> 42:16.750]  I mean, both of them, Scott
[42:17.070 --> 42:18.710]  and Sarah. I mean, you're doing
[42:18.710 --> 42:20.270]  that. Well, I can't believe you
[42:20.270 --> 42:21.270]  don't have this problem.
[42:21.270 --> 42:22.270]  Well, we do have that problem.
[42:22.310 --> 42:23.310]  We do have that problem.
[42:23.310 --> 42:24.310]  We do have that problem.
[42:24.350 --> 42:25.350]  We do have that problem.
[42:25.710 --> 42:26.910]  Well, we do have that problem.
[42:27.110 --> 42:28.110]  You know,
[42:29.430 --> 42:31.190]  yeah, they know what they're doing.
[42:31.230 --> 42:32.230]  And that's
[42:33.510 --> 42:35.270]  been extremely helpful
[42:35.270 --> 42:36.270]  for us. And, you
[42:37.270 --> 42:38.830]  know, just like they say a lot,
[42:39.350 --> 42:40.470]  there's a lot of information out
[42:40.470 --> 42:42.350]  there on the Internet about growing
[42:42.350 --> 42:44.390]  cannabis. And that's good
[42:45.030 --> 42:47.110]  generally. But, you know, a lot
[42:47.110 --> 42:48.510]  of it can be
[42:49.510 --> 42:50.510]  problematic, you
[42:51.390 --> 42:53.150]  know, at scale,
[42:53.310 --> 42:54.310]  definitely.
[42:54.310 --> 42:56.110]  And trying to do it commercially
[42:56.550 --> 42:58.030]  when if you're trying to do some of
[42:58.030 --> 42:59.990]  these really, like, intensive
[43:00.550 --> 43:01.550]  things, they can
[43:02.510 --> 43:03.550]  cause problems.
[43:03.550 --> 43:04.430]  It can cause you to quit.
[43:04.430 --> 43:06.230]  It can cause you to be unsuccessful
[43:06.830 --> 43:08.750]  and fail. And so that's
[43:08.750 --> 43:10.350]  yeah. So, yeah, the compost
[43:10.910 --> 43:11.910]  extract. I mean, it
[43:13.630 --> 43:14.910]  answers the question, you know,
[43:14.910 --> 43:15.910]  how do you.
[43:16.430 --> 43:17.430]  How do you get these
[43:18.230 --> 43:19.230]  microbes?
[43:20.230 --> 43:21.870]  You know, the right microbes
[43:22.350 --> 43:24.150]  to the right place, doing the right
[43:24.150 --> 43:26.030]  thing and extracting is the way to
[43:26.030 --> 43:27.030]  do that.
[43:29.820 --> 43:30.820]  And yeah.
[43:31.820 --> 43:32.780]  Go ahead, Scott.
[43:32.780 --> 43:33.780]  I was just going to say,
[43:35.460 --> 43:37.220]  you know, people call us for a lot
[43:37.220 --> 43:39.180]  of different reasons and free folk
[43:39.500 --> 43:41.060]  were already having success when
[43:41.380 --> 43:42.860]  they called us in. Sometimes people
[43:42.860 --> 43:44.140]  call us when things are wrecked.
[43:44.140 --> 43:45.340]  Some people call us when they want
[43:45.340 --> 43:46.460]  to find high performance.
[43:46.500 --> 43:48.420]  And so, you know, Jacob
[43:48.420 --> 43:49.660]  and Jason were already having good
[43:49.660 --> 43:50.660]  success.
[43:51.660 --> 43:53.220]  But finding that commercial
[43:53.220 --> 43:55.100]  consistency requires, in
[43:55.100 --> 43:56.940]  my personal opinion, a
[43:56.940 --> 43:58.740]  little bit of analytics to keep you
[43:58.740 --> 44:00.740]  within the field of play.
[44:00.740 --> 44:02.660]  And so, you know, Sarah
[44:02.660 --> 44:03.780]  and I have done a lot of that type
[44:03.780 --> 44:05.260]  of analytics and there's very clear
[44:05.260 --> 44:06.980]  patterns within the cannabis
[44:06.980 --> 44:08.700]  community with those biological
[44:08.700 --> 44:09.580]  populations.
[44:09.580 --> 44:10.580]  And, you know, same
[44:11.620 --> 44:12.460]  with soil chemistry.
[44:12.460 --> 44:14.020]  There's patterns in soil chemistry
[44:14.020 --> 44:15.180]  and trying to
[44:15.940 --> 44:17.580]  trying to make decisions in the
[44:17.740 --> 44:19.260]  cultivation space that
[44:19.540 --> 44:21.380]  don't throw you too far out
[44:21.380 --> 44:23.780]  of the ideal range of outcomes.
[44:24.060 --> 44:25.860]  And that can be very difficult at
[44:25.860 --> 44:26.860]  times.
[44:28.620 --> 44:29.900]  We have to use a microscope
[44:30.820 --> 44:32.540]  to refine our intuition
[44:32.540 --> 44:33.820]  about what we think is going on in
[44:33.820 --> 44:35.140]  the garden, especially when we're
[44:35.140 --> 44:37.460]  trying to be mindful about growing
[44:37.460 --> 44:39.220]  with this soil food web
[44:39.220 --> 44:40.980]  and maintaining it and watching it
[44:40.980 --> 44:41.980]  thrive. And so,
[44:43.020 --> 44:44.980]  you know, we don't necessarily
[44:45.900 --> 44:47.660]  have an eye for what
[44:47.660 --> 44:49.460]  we think is enough water
[44:49.460 --> 44:50.460]  or maybe we don't
[44:51.380 --> 44:52.940]  understand that it from the
[44:53.020 --> 44:54.300]  microbial community.
[44:54.300 --> 44:55.700]  They're telling us it's actually
[44:55.700 --> 44:56.700]  too much.
[44:56.700 --> 44:58.420]  And so it's a nice way to just,
[44:58.940 --> 45:00.100]  you know, calibrate your own
[45:00.100 --> 45:01.540]  intuition about what you're seeing
[45:01.580 --> 45:03.020]  on the boots on the ground.
[45:03.660 --> 45:04.660]  So.
[45:06.020 --> 45:07.020]  And things stratify
[45:07.820 --> 45:09.380]  throughout the cultivation space
[45:09.380 --> 45:10.900]  like people don't realize it, but
[45:11.620 --> 45:13.340]  you know, a home grower might send
[45:13.340 --> 45:14.580]  in two samples for us to
[45:15.180 --> 45:17.100]  analyze of two beds
[45:17.700 --> 45:19.820]  in their space, in their yard
[45:19.820 --> 45:20.780]  or whatever. They have two long
[45:20.780 --> 45:22.260]  beds and there's a tea brewer and
[45:22.260 --> 45:23.580]  they do their tea process and they
[45:23.580 --> 45:25.380]  apply it to bed one and they apply
[45:25.380 --> 45:26.980]  it to bed two in the same pattern
[45:26.980 --> 45:27.980]  over and over again.
[45:28.060 --> 45:29.860]  When you send those samples, we can
[45:29.860 --> 45:31.340]  clearly see those patterns and we
[45:31.340 --> 45:33.260]  can normally define which
[45:33.260 --> 45:34.940]  bed is closer to the tea brewer,
[45:35.300 --> 45:37.340]  you know. And so one of the main
[45:37.340 --> 45:38.700]  aspects of surviving in the
[45:39.140 --> 45:40.980]  cultivation space and commercial
[45:40.980 --> 45:42.860]  cultivation or really even
[45:42.860 --> 45:44.420]  at home is is
[45:44.900 --> 45:46.740]  even dealing with the way organisms
[45:46.740 --> 45:48.740]  stratify and separate through your
[45:48.740 --> 45:50.500]  cultivation space and try to narrow
[45:50.500 --> 45:51.900]  those into a more consistent
[45:52.660 --> 45:53.660]  bandwidth.
[45:55.340 --> 45:56.660]  The microbial detective work.
[45:57.020 --> 45:58.020]  Yeah.
[45:58.740 --> 45:59.700]  Yeah, it's impressive.
[45:59.700 --> 46:01.260]  And, you know, that's we want to we
[46:01.260 --> 46:02.420]  want to learn how to do all that
[46:02.420 --> 46:04.100]  stuff. You know, it is so much to
[46:04.100 --> 46:05.100]  learn.
[46:05.300 --> 46:06.900]  And Jason, I want to learn it all.
[46:07.060 --> 46:08.820]  And, you know, we we're trying
[46:08.820 --> 46:10.540]  to break off, you know, as much as we
[46:10.540 --> 46:12.340]  can and work with Scott and Sarah
[46:12.340 --> 46:13.860]  as long as we can, because, I mean,
[46:14.500 --> 46:15.580]  we're just we're absorbing
[46:15.580 --> 46:17.540]  everything. And but
[46:17.540 --> 46:19.100]  but we truly have
[46:19.420 --> 46:20.420]  have really
[46:21.300 --> 46:22.940]  learned a lot over the last year.
[46:22.940 --> 46:24.940]  And so, yeah, our
[46:27.100 --> 46:28.500]  just really measuring like,
[46:29.180 --> 46:30.900]  you know, and we kind of say like
[46:30.940 --> 46:32.740]  living soul quantified, you know,
[46:32.740 --> 46:34.900]  it's it's because
[46:35.140 --> 46:36.620]  Jason and I, you know, we're very
[46:36.620 --> 46:37.780]  analytical. We
[46:38.660 --> 46:40.020]  we want to know why we're doing what
[46:40.020 --> 46:41.660]  we're doing. And there's just a lot
[46:41.660 --> 46:43.260]  of there's not a lot of that out
[46:43.500 --> 46:44.380]  there in cannabis.
[46:44.380 --> 46:45.980]  And this is something that that
[46:46.300 --> 46:48.020]  we need to be better at.
[46:48.140 --> 46:49.140]  And and so this is
[46:50.020 --> 46:51.020]  how we do that.
[46:51.060 --> 46:52.260]  We're testing our soil.
[46:52.260 --> 46:54.180]  We're testing, you know,
[46:54.220 --> 46:56.140]  doing bioassays with aggressive
[46:56.140 --> 46:58.020]  soil. We're doing analyzing
[46:58.020 --> 46:59.940]  what you know, what's there, how we
[46:59.940 --> 47:01.580]  can improve it, you know, what we're
[47:01.580 --> 47:03.500]  putting into it, how that's affecting
[47:03.500 --> 47:05.820]  that situation, how it is improving
[47:05.820 --> 47:08.220]  or cause a decline
[47:08.220 --> 47:09.820]  in fungal populations.
[47:09.820 --> 47:11.500]  And, you know, maybe it's not worth
[47:11.500 --> 47:13.260]  the treatment that we did or maybe
[47:13.260 --> 47:14.980]  it's not worth this thing.
[47:15.020 --> 47:16.740]  And so but
[47:17.100 --> 47:18.580]  answering those questions, you know,
[47:18.580 --> 47:20.420]  that's that's why we that's how we
[47:20.420 --> 47:22.300]  got here, because we
[47:22.300 --> 47:23.540]  had the question. There were no
[47:23.540 --> 47:25.140]  answers that we thought were.
[47:26.180 --> 47:28.020]  We're legitimate enough for
[47:28.020 --> 47:29.980]  us to risk our livelihoods
[47:29.980 --> 47:31.980]  on, and so we kept asking,
[47:32.740 --> 47:34.660]  kept asking, we kept searching
[47:34.660 --> 47:36.500]  and Jason, you know, found
[47:36.500 --> 47:38.340]  Scott and said, hey, if
[47:38.340 --> 47:40.180]  we need to, if we need to holler
[47:40.180 --> 47:41.540]  at them and see if they'll help us,
[47:42.340 --> 47:43.700]  you know, it was,
[47:44.540 --> 47:46.180]  you know, we kind of convinced them
[47:46.460 --> 47:47.260]  to take us on.
[47:47.260 --> 47:49.140]  And and we
[47:49.140 --> 47:49.900]  had to do that.
[47:49.900 --> 47:51.180]  And but, you know,
[47:51.780 --> 47:53.300]  it's been really helpful to have
[47:53.300 --> 47:55.460]  people in the community to
[47:55.460 --> 47:57.380]  to to reach out to when we make
[47:57.380 --> 47:59.580]  mistakes and to learn, learn from.
[48:02.700 --> 48:03.700]  Well,
[48:04.700 --> 48:05.700]  good, no good.
[48:05.900 --> 48:07.740]  Well, I was just saying, you
[48:07.740 --> 48:09.580]  know, free folk was wanting to
[48:09.580 --> 48:11.260]  be the most adventurous
[48:12.540 --> 48:14.060]  in our consulting work from a
[48:14.060 --> 48:14.860]  distance, too.
[48:14.860 --> 48:16.460]  So that was something unique for us.
[48:16.460 --> 48:17.300]  Like that was.
[48:17.300 --> 48:18.620]  Well, they want a NASCAR just as
[48:18.940 --> 48:19.940]  we do. So, yeah.
[48:20.180 --> 48:22.260]  But like in the in the post-COVID
[48:22.260 --> 48:24.340]  world of travel free consulting
[48:24.340 --> 48:25.780]  now, you know, it was like it was a
[48:25.780 --> 48:27.700]  stretch. It was a stretch for me as
[48:27.700 --> 48:29.980]  well as, you know, how
[48:30.020 --> 48:31.460]  how far they wanted to go.
[48:31.460 --> 48:33.100]  And that was, you know, really kind
[48:33.100 --> 48:34.660]  of the first time we've gone this
[48:34.660 --> 48:35.860]  in depth from a distance.
[48:35.860 --> 48:37.140]  Normally there's certain things that
[48:37.140 --> 48:38.140]  I do in person.
[48:38.980 --> 48:41.020]  And so that was, you know, it was
[48:41.020 --> 48:43.020]  a good little
[48:43.020 --> 48:45.260]  little skills enhancement
[48:45.260 --> 48:46.660]  opportunity, I guess you could say.
[48:46.660 --> 48:48.500]  But it's it's
[48:48.780 --> 48:50.300]  refreshing to me because
[48:52.780 --> 48:54.700]  I'm always fascinated how
[48:54.900 --> 48:57.140]  like I get why in the living soil
[48:57.140 --> 48:59.180]  community there's a there's a goal
[48:59.180 --> 49:01.100]  to do nothing and people are
[49:01.100 --> 49:03.060]  motivated by Masanobu and
[49:03.500 --> 49:04.660]  people think that their
[49:06.500 --> 49:08.300]  favorite farms are doing nothing as
[49:08.300 --> 49:10.100]  well. And and
[49:10.420 --> 49:12.820]  I just I think that you should
[49:12.820 --> 49:14.940]  within reason and without
[49:14.940 --> 49:16.940]  causing antagonism, support
[49:16.940 --> 49:18.700]  the plant in
[49:19.380 --> 49:21.180]  as balanced and complete way as
[49:21.180 --> 49:22.740]  possible and
[49:23.100 --> 49:24.780]  reach its highest genetic potential.
[49:24.780 --> 49:25.580]  Yeah.
[49:25.580 --> 49:27.180]  Yeah. Because so much medicine to
[49:27.180 --> 49:27.900]  give.
[49:27.900 --> 49:29.660]  Well, unlike in Oklahoma, like
[49:30.380 --> 49:32.380]  there's five thousand
[49:32.380 --> 49:34.180]  and five hundred farms
[49:34.180 --> 49:36.220]  producing bud rotted flower
[49:36.220 --> 49:38.020]  grown with salts like
[49:38.580 --> 49:40.580]  you, you should want to do
[49:40.580 --> 49:42.460]  something that is so dramatically
[49:42.460 --> 49:43.860]  contrasted to that
[49:44.500 --> 49:46.140]  that people cannot
[49:47.380 --> 49:49.500]  notice that, you know, and
[49:49.860 --> 49:50.540]  not notice.
[49:50.540 --> 49:51.260]  Now, I don't know.
[49:51.260 --> 49:52.540]  Yeah, not
[49:53.420 --> 49:54.460]  smoke the full joint.
[49:54.460 --> 49:55.460]  But you know what I'm trying to say,
[49:55.460 --> 49:57.700]  kids like we're in a market
[49:57.700 --> 49:58.860]  where, you know, some of the
[49:58.860 --> 50:00.660]  comments are talking about all
[50:00.660 --> 50:02.100]  the chads and all these things going
[50:02.100 --> 50:03.140]  in the market. And it's like those
[50:03.140 --> 50:04.580]  people are just funneling money into
[50:04.580 --> 50:05.500]  low quality pot.
[50:05.500 --> 50:06.820]  It's not really getting smoked.
[50:06.900 --> 50:08.820]  And, you know, some
[50:08.820 --> 50:09.820]  of it is.
[50:10.060 --> 50:11.380]  But if you take
[50:12.180 --> 50:13.900]  genetics that have been selected,
[50:13.900 --> 50:15.900]  like Jacob and Jason, that have done
[50:15.900 --> 50:17.420]  some work picking unique
[50:17.900 --> 50:19.620]  cannabis that provides
[50:19.620 --> 50:21.540]  a benefit is enjoyable to smoke,
[50:22.100 --> 50:23.780]  has some unique characteristics.
[50:23.780 --> 50:25.660]  And, you know, you put that
[50:25.660 --> 50:27.780]  into a system that has very
[50:27.780 --> 50:29.420]  high biological activity that's
[50:29.420 --> 50:31.620]  complete and you have a soil
[50:31.620 --> 50:33.340]  that has chemistry that's balanced
[50:33.380 --> 50:35.260]  like there's nothing
[50:35.260 --> 50:37.140]  that compares to the flower that
[50:37.140 --> 50:38.740]  comes out of that situation.
[50:38.940 --> 50:40.340]  And it's and that's not
[50:40.940 --> 50:42.340]  that's not saying like I'm trying to
[50:42.340 --> 50:44.220]  champion. It's like we've worked
[50:44.220 --> 50:45.860]  with famous
[50:45.860 --> 50:47.060]  people, you know, and we've worked
[50:47.060 --> 50:48.340]  with every type of everything.
[50:48.340 --> 50:49.540]  We've smoked all their pot.
[50:49.580 --> 50:51.460]  And it's like, you know, what
[50:51.460 --> 50:53.540]  Jacob and Jason are doing in farms
[50:53.540 --> 50:55.460]  like them. There's not another
[50:55.460 --> 50:57.300]  product that even is
[50:57.300 --> 50:59.180]  relatable to that flower
[50:59.660 --> 51:01.860]  marriage between what the microbes
[51:01.860 --> 51:03.340]  and the plant can do
[51:03.980 --> 51:05.820]  when they have the nutrition there
[51:05.900 --> 51:07.620]  and the proper team to
[51:07.820 --> 51:09.500]  support that, like the medicine that
[51:09.500 --> 51:11.740]  comes out of that is just phenomenal.
[51:11.780 --> 51:13.340]  These guys are doing a phenomenal job
[51:13.340 --> 51:14.340]  as well.
[51:14.900 --> 51:16.180]  Actual medicine makers, in my
[51:16.180 --> 51:17.180]  opinion.
[51:17.180 --> 51:19.060]  All right. So just quickly, the
[51:19.300 --> 51:20.740]  people are getting restless.
[51:20.780 --> 51:22.060]  They're like, I thought this was a
[51:22.060 --> 51:23.140]  garden tour.
[51:23.540 --> 51:25.140]  So let me let me cue up.
[51:26.740 --> 51:28.620]  Yeah, that was the very beginning.
[51:30.540 --> 51:32.140]  I was going to cue up the
[51:32.580 --> 51:34.420]  let me go to the blue mat set up
[51:34.420 --> 51:36.260]  next and then maybe we can go to
[51:36.260 --> 51:37.580]  the cover crop.
[51:38.820 --> 51:39.820]  Yeah.
[51:40.140 --> 51:41.940]  Give me one second.
[51:42.940 --> 51:44.340]  Yeah, we have to apologize.
[51:44.380 --> 51:46.140]  We can't do the live stuff, so I
[51:46.140 --> 51:48.060]  don't know if everybody were rural.
[51:48.100 --> 51:49.260]  So we just don't have the reception.
[51:49.980 --> 51:51.500]  So, yeah, this is just a video of
[51:51.700 --> 51:52.700]  our blue mat set up.
[51:52.700 --> 51:54.220]  We're running off a fifty five gallon
[51:54.220 --> 51:56.100]  reservoir, you know, piped it up on
[51:56.100 --> 51:57.940]  the ceiling then and then drop down
[51:57.940 --> 51:58.940]  into the racks.
[51:58.940 --> 52:00.780]  There's the pressure reducer right
[52:00.780 --> 52:01.780]  there.
[52:01.820 --> 52:03.420]  Comes down to that eight millimeter
[52:03.420 --> 52:05.540]  to get a valve there.
[52:05.540 --> 52:07.020]  And then you can see we ran for
[52:07.020 --> 52:09.020]  blue for blue soap lines
[52:09.020 --> 52:10.420]  down each bed.
[52:10.420 --> 52:12.020]  So, yeah, so we're running in and
[52:12.020 --> 52:13.500]  out of the beds with the with half
[52:13.500 --> 52:15.660]  inch PVC supply and then,
[52:16.420 --> 52:17.620]  you know, running into those blue
[52:17.620 --> 52:18.620]  mats that way.
[52:18.660 --> 52:20.660]  So it's been awesome.
[52:20.700 --> 52:22.220]  I mean, we've had the system in
[52:22.220 --> 52:24.460]  place for about a month now and
[52:24.780 --> 52:26.580]  it's just like the plants are just,
[52:27.300 --> 52:29.180]  you know, pulling the water directly
[52:29.180 --> 52:30.460]  out of the reservoir at this point.
[52:30.500 --> 52:31.980]  You know, it just seems like, you
[52:31.980 --> 52:33.740]  know, the capillary action and
[52:33.740 --> 52:35.900]  everything is just it's amazing.
[52:35.940 --> 52:36.940]  It's really interesting.
[52:36.980 --> 52:38.180]  It's a really interesting
[52:38.180 --> 52:39.180]  experience.
[52:39.180 --> 52:41.020]  It's really interesting to watch how
[52:41.020 --> 52:42.260]  they're responding to
[52:42.940 --> 52:44.100]  and the microbes as well.
[52:44.100 --> 52:45.740]  And so you can you'll see when we
[52:46.820 --> 52:48.420]  when we go through some of the just
[52:48.980 --> 52:51.340]  visible fungus surface
[52:51.580 --> 52:53.460]  type fungus
[52:53.460 --> 52:54.580]  that you'll see when we go through
[52:54.580 --> 52:55.580]  that video.
[52:55.820 --> 52:57.620]  That's a lot of that is because
[52:57.620 --> 52:59.260]  blue mats have allowed us to
[52:59.260 --> 53:00.740]  have a little more of a consistent
[53:00.740 --> 53:01.980]  moisture situation.
[53:04.500 --> 53:06.180]  All right. So you want me to cue up
[53:06.180 --> 53:08.620]  one of the fungus
[53:09.180 --> 53:10.620]  the close up video?
[53:11.940 --> 53:12.940]  Yeah. Just yeah.
[53:12.940 --> 53:14.900]  You can go through the pictures that
[53:14.980 --> 53:16.500]  there or the video.
[53:16.860 --> 53:18.300]  Yeah. Let me start with the video
[53:18.300 --> 53:19.300]  and then I'll.
[53:21.420 --> 53:23.300]  So this was just me going
[53:23.300 --> 53:24.300]  in there and walking around and
[53:24.300 --> 53:25.980]  kind of zooming in at the base of
[53:25.980 --> 53:26.980]  the plants.
[53:26.980 --> 53:28.820]  And so this kind
[53:28.820 --> 53:30.620]  of shows where that
[53:30.980 --> 53:33.180]  blue soak hose is starting
[53:33.180 --> 53:34.180]  the drip right there
[53:35.140 --> 53:36.500]  and where we had dropped some.
[53:36.820 --> 53:38.420]  We had put in this fungus.
[53:38.420 --> 53:39.420]  This is actually a
[53:40.780 --> 53:43.260]  King's euphoria mycelium
[53:44.740 --> 53:46.260]  which is also known as wine cap
[53:46.260 --> 53:47.060]  mushroom.
[53:47.060 --> 53:48.060]  And we propagated
[53:49.140 --> 53:51.180]  that and then spread
[53:51.180 --> 53:52.220]  it out into the beds.
[53:52.980 --> 53:54.260]  So this is just kind of walking
[53:54.260 --> 53:56.260]  down. You can see you can see
[53:56.260 --> 53:57.420]  the living mulch.
[53:57.900 --> 53:59.420]  So if we kind of pause
[53:59.740 --> 54:01.020]  on a picture of the living mulch,
[54:01.020 --> 54:02.100]  I can talk about what's in it.
[54:02.580 --> 54:03.700]  But yeah, this is just a
[54:05.060 --> 54:06.220]  picture of this.
[54:06.500 --> 54:07.780]  You know, we use wood chips from
[54:07.780 --> 54:09.060]  the property that
[54:10.060 --> 54:11.180]  have been here for a while.
[54:11.740 --> 54:13.340]  We use straw as part of
[54:13.340 --> 54:15.140]  the carbon that
[54:15.140 --> 54:16.300]  we add to the situation.
[54:16.300 --> 54:17.540]  So straw and wood chips.
[54:18.100 --> 54:19.220]  And so you can see the straw and
[54:19.220 --> 54:20.420]  you can see some wood chips there
[54:20.420 --> 54:21.660]  and a little bit of fungus on it.
[54:22.260 --> 54:23.980]  You go ahead and go a little bit
[54:23.980 --> 54:24.860]  further.
[54:24.860 --> 54:26.780]  You kind of jumps into each plant
[54:26.780 --> 54:28.460]  here and just keep
[54:28.460 --> 54:30.060]  on going. But as far as the
[54:30.740 --> 54:32.780]  living mulch, the green stuff,
[54:32.780 --> 54:34.540]  we've got dichondra.
[54:35.260 --> 54:36.580]  You can see the dichondra there.
[54:36.940 --> 54:38.500]  The grass is white
[54:38.740 --> 54:39.860]  wheat, which is,
[54:41.060 --> 54:42.700]  you know, you can see
[54:42.700 --> 54:44.260]  some more mycelium
[54:44.260 --> 54:45.260]  growing down there.
[54:47.500 --> 54:48.820]  And this is just throughout.
[54:48.820 --> 54:50.820]  You dig down really anywhere
[54:50.820 --> 54:52.180]  in the beds, you're going to find
[54:52.580 --> 54:53.580]  some fungus.
[54:53.740 --> 54:55.220]  You're probably going to find you
[54:55.220 --> 54:57.620]  might get to see like a centipede
[54:57.620 --> 54:58.620]  or something here.
[55:01.020 --> 55:02.540]  I saw a centipede on one of these.
[55:02.540 --> 55:03.540]  Goodbye.
[55:05.140 --> 55:06.540]  When we were doing the video, so
[55:06.780 --> 55:08.020]  there's a lot of stuff going on.
[55:08.020 --> 55:09.180]  I mean, we've got we're running
[55:09.180 --> 55:10.180]  soil mites,
[55:10.900 --> 55:11.940]  you know, the H-Miles.
[55:11.940 --> 55:13.620]  We've got a pretty heavy population
[55:13.620 --> 55:15.860]  of soil mites generalist
[55:15.860 --> 55:16.700]  in there.
[55:16.700 --> 55:18.380]  And then, yeah, so
[55:18.580 --> 55:20.300]  you can see the cover crop.
[55:21.380 --> 55:23.060]  You know, it's pretty thick
[55:23.500 --> 55:25.420]  and, you know, there's
[55:25.500 --> 55:26.540]  some of the kind of
[55:27.300 --> 55:28.620]  mycelium reaching out and
[55:28.620 --> 55:29.620]  digesting that
[55:31.860 --> 55:33.220]  those wood chips there.
[55:33.340 --> 55:35.380]  So so this part of living soil
[55:35.380 --> 55:36.540]  is something that we
[55:37.260 --> 55:39.300]  we've learned as we've gone
[55:39.300 --> 55:40.740]  here is, you know,
[55:41.740 --> 55:43.100]  you got to feed this thing, you
[55:43.100 --> 55:45.020]  know, so like you got to feed
[55:45.020 --> 55:46.860]  this machine. And so like we're we
[55:46.860 --> 55:48.340]  got to keep throwing that wood
[55:48.340 --> 55:49.780]  chips and the straw in there so
[55:49.780 --> 55:51.140]  that this fungus has something to
[55:51.140 --> 55:53.060]  eat. And so, you know, Jason
[55:53.060 --> 55:54.460]  and I are going in there dropping
[55:54.900 --> 55:56.780]  dropping wood chips, feeding
[55:56.780 --> 55:58.420]  our fungus, you know, basically.
[55:58.420 --> 55:59.540]  And we're just like, oh, there you
[55:59.540 --> 56:00.380]  go, little guy.
[56:00.380 --> 56:02.180]  You know, and so we're
[56:02.180 --> 56:03.780]  like taking care of our fungus
[56:04.580 --> 56:05.420]  as well.
[56:05.420 --> 56:07.260]  And but but yeah,
[56:07.540 --> 56:09.180]  so so, you know, this is
[56:09.180 --> 56:10.540]  just kind of experimentation.
[56:10.740 --> 56:12.140]  We're trying to kind of see
[56:12.660 --> 56:14.300]  what works and what, you
[56:14.300 --> 56:16.260]  know, it's a balance
[56:16.260 --> 56:18.020]  because we don't want
[56:18.020 --> 56:19.700]  to too much stuff going
[56:19.700 --> 56:21.460]  on. It can cause anaerobic
[56:21.460 --> 56:22.940]  conditions. And we've kind of gotten
[56:22.940 --> 56:23.940]  into it.
[56:23.940 --> 56:25.660]  We're pushing, pushing the
[56:25.660 --> 56:27.620]  envelope on that and had
[56:27.620 --> 56:29.340]  some kind of indicators that we
[56:29.340 --> 56:30.340]  need to
[56:31.220 --> 56:32.700]  decrease the moisture a little bit
[56:32.700 --> 56:33.980]  in that situation.
[56:34.060 --> 56:35.700]  So it's definitely
[56:35.700 --> 56:36.460]  a balance.
[56:36.460 --> 56:38.220]  And but yeah,
[56:38.780 --> 56:40.380]  we're encouraged by the fungal
[56:40.380 --> 56:41.300]  growth.
[56:41.300 --> 56:42.820]  You know, we think that we can
[56:42.820 --> 56:43.820]  continue to
[56:45.300 --> 56:46.780]  to do that and add that in.
[56:46.780 --> 56:48.140]  So we've added it in twice
[56:48.580 --> 56:50.700]  and we propagated
[56:51.100 --> 56:52.820]  that mycelium ourselves
[56:52.820 --> 56:53.860]  and kind of threw it in there.
[56:53.860 --> 56:54.980]  But we also bring it in with the
[56:54.980 --> 56:56.660]  wood chips. I mean, when we're out
[56:56.660 --> 56:57.660]  there digging in that wood chip
[56:57.660 --> 56:58.980]  pile, we're digging through for the
[56:58.980 --> 57:00.700]  best, best looking
[57:00.700 --> 57:02.580]  like mycelial strands
[57:02.580 --> 57:03.580]  that you'll see in there.
[57:04.500 --> 57:06.300]  So we're kind of selecting
[57:06.300 --> 57:07.980]  and bringing in native
[57:08.500 --> 57:10.020]  indigenous mycelium
[57:10.820 --> 57:11.900]  as well. And so we'll have
[57:12.460 --> 57:13.540]  different types of fungus
[57:14.460 --> 57:15.980]  on the soil surface as well as
[57:15.980 --> 57:17.220]  below the soil surface,
[57:17.700 --> 57:19.140]  doing different things to kind of
[57:19.140 --> 57:20.260]  keep that that
[57:21.180 --> 57:22.380]  that system working.
[57:22.380 --> 57:24.620]  And and, you know, having
[57:24.620 --> 57:26.340]  having the fungus and focusing on
[57:26.340 --> 57:27.380]  that is something that Scott and
[57:27.460 --> 57:29.380]  Sarah have taught us is
[57:29.380 --> 57:30.380]  extremely important.
[57:30.380 --> 57:31.860]  And you think about the way that
[57:32.140 --> 57:33.580]  forests feed themselves and things
[57:33.580 --> 57:34.580]  like that. I mean,
[57:35.380 --> 57:37.380]  that that fungal network
[57:37.380 --> 57:38.900]  is the reason why we use
[57:38.900 --> 57:39.900]  mycos and
[57:41.780 --> 57:43.300]  getting the plants to
[57:43.740 --> 57:45.540]  use that, use the
[57:45.540 --> 57:47.180]  fungus as a, you
[57:47.180 --> 57:49.060]  know, to get nutrients and exchange
[57:49.060 --> 57:50.980]  nutrients and digest
[57:51.780 --> 57:52.780]  material,
[57:53.540 --> 57:54.540]  convert
[57:55.060 --> 57:56.060]  nutrients.
[57:56.100 --> 57:57.100]  Yeah.
[57:57.940 --> 57:59.820]  This is the the most
[57:59.820 --> 58:00.820]  living soil.
[58:00.940 --> 58:02.740]  It's the most alive soil we've ever
[58:02.740 --> 58:04.500]  had. So it's pretty interesting.
[58:08.380 --> 58:10.340]  Well, and it changes a lot, too.
[58:10.340 --> 58:12.260]  So at the same time, so in the same
[58:12.260 --> 58:14.180]  month you added the blue mats, you
[58:14.180 --> 58:15.340]  also added the
[58:15.900 --> 58:17.420]  King's Tropharia wine cap
[58:18.180 --> 58:19.740]  and then that dramatically changed
[58:19.740 --> 58:20.740]  things again.
[58:20.740 --> 58:22.820]  You know, how dynamic was
[58:22.820 --> 58:24.580]  that? Just that one change
[58:24.580 --> 58:25.620]  of configuration.
[58:27.180 --> 58:28.620]  Well, you know, adding the blue mats
[58:28.620 --> 58:29.620]  is.
[58:30.460 --> 58:31.460]  You know,
[58:32.380 --> 58:33.580]  it's almost even caused like
[58:33.580 --> 58:35.380]  environmental considerations, you
[58:35.380 --> 58:37.540]  know, because of the amount
[58:37.540 --> 58:39.660]  of water that's not available
[58:39.660 --> 58:40.460]  is more.
[58:40.460 --> 58:42.500]  And and then so
[58:42.500 --> 58:44.020]  the plants are when they're really
[58:44.020 --> 58:45.540]  growing there, you know, they're
[58:45.540 --> 58:46.540]  producing more water.
[58:46.540 --> 58:47.700]  So we've got to kind of
[58:48.540 --> 58:50.260]  dehumidify more than
[58:50.980 --> 58:51.980]  than we had before.
[58:52.420 --> 58:53.860]  So it's kind of caused some of those
[58:53.860 --> 58:55.540]  things. But just in the soil and
[58:55.660 --> 58:56.660]  you know, we don't know.
[58:56.700 --> 58:58.300]  It's like it's only been a month,
[58:58.620 --> 59:00.620]  but but, you
[59:00.620 --> 59:02.620]  know, it seems like
[59:05.100 --> 59:06.900]  the soil is almost like a like a
[59:06.900 --> 59:08.580]  sponge now, whereas when we're
[59:08.580 --> 59:09.860]  hand watering, you know, we would
[59:09.860 --> 59:11.700]  kind of and everybody knows you
[59:11.700 --> 59:13.500]  hand water and then you dig down and
[59:13.500 --> 59:15.100]  it's dry, you know, and
[59:15.860 --> 59:16.860]  it's dry.
[59:16.860 --> 59:19.060]  And so it's just you really have
[59:20.460 --> 59:22.020]  it's about confidence in what you're
[59:22.020 --> 59:23.780]  doing. And sometimes hand watering
[59:23.820 --> 59:25.460]  water, but I don't feel like they
[59:25.460 --> 59:26.860]  got enough. But with the blue mats,
[59:26.860 --> 59:28.220]  it's more of like a consistent
[59:28.220 --> 59:29.220]  moisture in the soil.
[59:29.220 --> 59:31.380]  It's more of like a deeper
[59:32.300 --> 59:34.300]  soak almost and like
[59:34.740 --> 59:35.740]  a more consistent.
[59:35.740 --> 59:36.940]  So and so I think that
[59:37.660 --> 59:38.660]  it's caused like.
[59:40.460 --> 59:41.980]  You know, a lot more growth.
[59:42.340 --> 59:43.780]  So it's really just, you know,
[59:43.780 --> 59:45.340]  enhance the entire machine in there.
[59:45.340 --> 59:46.340]  So I think
[59:47.660 --> 59:49.540]  it's yet yet to really be determined
[59:49.540 --> 59:50.540]  the overall end result.
[59:50.540 --> 59:51.540]  So I think it's it's
[59:51.740 --> 59:53.300]  yet to really be determined the
[59:53.300 --> 59:54.300]  overall impact of.
[59:55.220 --> 59:56.220]  On the soil, but
[59:57.100 --> 59:59.020]  the plants are really enjoying
[59:59.300 --> 01:00:00.300]  themselves.
[01:00:00.900 --> 01:00:01.900]  Yeah.
[01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:04.500]  Yeah. Canopy's pretty fantastic
[01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:05.780]  to you guys are doing good at that.
[01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:07.980]  Yeah.
[01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:09.780]  Yeah. That's always a challenge in
[01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:11.180]  the eight foot ceilings.
[01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:12.700]  Yeah.
[01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:15.220]  Sorry, I was just troubleshooting
[01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:16.220]  Jim Jemez
[01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:18.700]  school zoom log in.
[01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:19.900]  You're good.
[01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:21.060]  But I'm back.
[01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:22.540]  So you also had we
[01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:24.900]  had like this stuff.
[01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:26.700]  Yeah.
[01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:28.500]  Yeah. So what this what this is, is
[01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:30.700]  again, we're you know,
[01:00:31.180 --> 01:00:32.620]  we're thinking, OK, we need fungus.
[01:00:32.620 --> 01:00:33.740]  Well, how do we get fungus?
[01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:35.380]  Well, now we're going to be my
[01:00:35.380 --> 01:00:36.380]  colleges.
[01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:37.540]  So.
[01:00:38.940 --> 01:00:40.300]  So, you know, there's some of this
[01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:41.740]  commercially available, but we
[01:00:41.740 --> 01:00:43.060]  basically just bought some spore
[01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:44.900]  syringes of the Kings for you,
[01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:48.060]  you know, and gave it a shot.
[01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:50.060]  And so this is white
[01:00:50.060 --> 01:00:51.300]  wheat grain.
[01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:53.300]  So it's just seeds of grain.
[01:00:54.580 --> 01:00:56.780]  You know, we
[01:00:57.100 --> 01:00:58.940]  sterilize that and then
[01:00:58.940 --> 01:01:01.140]  inoculated in a jar with,
[01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:03.780]  you know, the spores
[01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:05.700]  that we bought there in the liquid
[01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:06.740]  solution.
[01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:08.700]  We just inoculate the the
[01:01:09.660 --> 01:01:11.380]  sterilized grain and then that, you
[01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:13.260]  know, over a couple of weeks, we'll
[01:01:13.540 --> 01:01:15.220]  you know, if you keep if it's not
[01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:16.940]  contaminated and that's, you know,
[01:01:17.260 --> 01:01:19.260]  you got to keep keep from getting
[01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:20.980]  contaminated and isolate that
[01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:22.100]  that.
[01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:24.460]  That's for if that's all
[01:01:24.460 --> 01:01:25.540]  it's in there and you can get it
[01:01:25.540 --> 01:01:27.580]  there, then then you're you know,
[01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:29.100]  it'll grow throughout and then we
[01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:30.860]  just bust that up with a stick, you
[01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:31.900]  know, and just spread it out
[01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:33.260]  throughout the beds.
[01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:34.460]  And so we did it that way.
[01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:35.660]  And then another way that we tried
[01:01:35.660 --> 01:01:37.700]  it is that we did the
[01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:39.060]  straw. We actually put it
[01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:42.700]  from from the inoculated
[01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:45.220]  grain into
[01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:47.500]  straw and then put the
[01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:48.700]  straw into the beds.
[01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:50.420]  And that worked as well.
[01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:53.020]  And so we're not you know,
[01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:54.860]  we're trying we might try even
[01:01:54.860 --> 01:01:57.060]  another way using wood chips
[01:01:57.220 --> 01:01:58.380]  the next time and just kind of see
[01:01:58.380 --> 01:01:59.380]  which works best.
[01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:00.740]  But it's all working.
[01:02:00.820 --> 01:02:01.900]  You know, it's all getting in there.
[01:02:02.020 --> 01:02:03.020]  And so.
[01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:10.300]  Scott and Sarah, any deep you
[01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:11.300]  guys are quiet.
[01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:14.300]  Scott, you smoked a comatose
[01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:15.300]  joint.
[01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:16.540]  I did.
[01:02:17.980 --> 01:02:19.500]  I didn't smoke the coffee version.
[01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:20.860]  I smoked the nighttime version.
[01:02:20.980 --> 01:02:21.980]  Right. Right.
[01:02:22.580 --> 01:02:24.260]  That's how Scott starts his days.
[01:02:25.340 --> 01:02:27.500]  So I'm just kind of going around
[01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:29.260]  the the graphics
[01:02:29.260 --> 01:02:31.340]  I have to please the people
[01:02:31.340 --> 01:02:33.220]  who want less conversation and more
[01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:34.220]  visuals.
[01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:37.100]  They don't need to see me.
[01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:38.540]  Yeah.
[01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:40.660]  So so we had the main room.
[01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:42.300]  Let me go. You want to go.
[01:02:43.340 --> 01:02:45.260]  You want to talk cultivars
[01:02:45.260 --> 01:02:47.180]  selection and clones and mothers
[01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:49.260]  and the super silver
[01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:50.260]  haze and.
[01:02:51.260 --> 01:02:52.260]  Yeah. Jason.
[01:02:56.550 --> 01:02:57.670]  I mean, because we got a video for
[01:02:57.670 --> 01:02:59.470]  the the clone
[01:02:59.790 --> 01:03:01.710]  and mothers and we can talk about
[01:03:01.710 --> 01:03:02.830]  cultivars after that.
[01:03:04.150 --> 01:03:06.150]  Yeah. Just give me a second
[01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:07.150]  to.
[01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:09.030]  We might have to go back to the room
[01:03:09.030 --> 01:03:10.790]  and the room video or something.
[01:03:11.710 --> 01:03:14.810]  There we go.
[01:03:14.810 --> 01:03:15.810]  You see.
[01:03:19.330 --> 01:03:20.770]  All right. Jason,
[01:03:21.610 --> 01:03:22.610]  the man with the dirt.
[01:03:22.850 --> 01:03:24.290]  Do you guys see the comment earlier
[01:03:24.330 --> 01:03:25.810]  where someone was like one of my
[01:03:25.810 --> 01:03:27.650]  colleagues walked in was like, why
[01:03:27.650 --> 01:03:28.850]  am I watching a video?
[01:03:28.890 --> 01:03:30.930]  Why are you watching a video of some
[01:03:30.930 --> 01:03:32.930]  dude playing with dirt?
[01:03:35.930 --> 01:03:36.930]  Watching farming.
[01:03:37.210 --> 01:03:38.570]  That's all we do is play with dirt.
[01:03:41.090 --> 01:03:42.290]  It's all micro porn.
[01:03:44.450 --> 01:03:46.890]  Yeah. So this is just your typical
[01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:49.130]  village on 10.
[01:03:49.170 --> 01:03:50.730]  That's on Amazon.
[01:03:51.570 --> 01:03:54.090]  And we did this originally because
[01:03:54.450 --> 01:03:56.690]  we we started everything from C
[01:03:57.090 --> 01:03:59.050]  and we had about
[01:03:59.050 --> 01:04:00.410]  eight different cultivars
[01:04:01.210 --> 01:04:03.530]  and we needed to grow mothers
[01:04:03.810 --> 01:04:05.690]  in order to fill up
[01:04:05.850 --> 01:04:07.090]  all of our racks in there.
[01:04:07.090 --> 01:04:09.130]  And so when we first started
[01:04:09.130 --> 01:04:11.170]  out, all we had was a mini split.
[01:04:11.170 --> 01:04:12.170]  And so.
[01:04:13.050 --> 01:04:15.090]  We had to basically have
[01:04:15.090 --> 01:04:17.130]  a bedroom inside of our
[01:04:17.130 --> 01:04:19.090]  flower room, and
[01:04:19.090 --> 01:04:21.410]  so we accomplished that using
[01:04:21.450 --> 01:04:23.690]  tents because that's where we started
[01:04:23.690 --> 01:04:24.690]  from.
[01:04:25.130 --> 01:04:26.130]  And.
[01:04:27.210 --> 01:04:28.850]  So we can really
[01:04:30.170 --> 01:04:31.810]  double our square footage by having
[01:04:31.810 --> 01:04:33.890]  this the shelf here and
[01:04:33.970 --> 01:04:35.930]  we're using a turbo clone or
[01:04:36.090 --> 01:04:37.250]  140 site
[01:04:38.090 --> 01:04:39.730]  on the top and on the bottom.
[01:04:40.810 --> 01:04:42.690]  And I think that that's a common
[01:04:43.210 --> 01:04:45.330]  meme on the Internet is that,
[01:04:45.450 --> 01:04:47.650]  oh, look at my roots after five days.
[01:04:48.130 --> 01:04:50.210]  And really, you know,
[01:04:50.210 --> 01:04:51.850]  it's 14 to 21 days.
[01:04:54.010 --> 01:04:55.730]  I know that probably a lot of people
[01:04:55.730 --> 01:04:57.850]  out there are like, what
[01:04:57.850 --> 01:05:00.050]  are you guys using in your cloner?
[01:05:00.810 --> 01:05:03.090]  And we've really tried
[01:05:03.090 --> 01:05:04.490]  just about everything.
[01:05:04.850 --> 01:05:06.690]  And we
[01:05:07.050 --> 01:05:08.570]  just use tap water
[01:05:08.970 --> 01:05:09.970]  and clone
[01:05:10.930 --> 01:05:11.930]  exclusion.
[01:05:12.290 --> 01:05:14.090]  So, yeah,
[01:05:14.370 --> 01:05:15.610]  you know, you don't have to worry
[01:05:15.610 --> 01:05:16.610]  about pH.
[01:05:17.490 --> 01:05:19.290]  Even even your clone water, you
[01:05:19.290 --> 01:05:20.690]  don't have to worry about pH.
[01:05:21.570 --> 01:05:23.370]  And that's probably
[01:05:23.370 --> 01:05:24.690]  most people out there listening or
[01:05:24.690 --> 01:05:26.570]  wondering, do they pH their
[01:05:26.570 --> 01:05:28.530]  water? And no, we don't pH
[01:05:28.530 --> 01:05:30.130]  our water on anything.
[01:05:32.050 --> 01:05:33.890]  And yeah, so so the clones,
[01:05:33.890 --> 01:05:35.450]  you know, yeah, we're operating that
[01:05:35.890 --> 01:05:37.290]  the hundred forty four site, you
[01:05:37.290 --> 01:05:38.890]  know, that was just those have been
[01:05:38.890 --> 01:05:40.690]  in there five or six days.
[01:05:40.690 --> 01:05:42.890]  They do start to kind of root about
[01:05:43.130 --> 01:05:44.890]  seven days, eight days.
[01:05:44.890 --> 01:05:46.210]  And then, yeah, before we would want
[01:05:46.210 --> 01:05:48.090]  to plant them, yeah, we'd be we'd
[01:05:48.090 --> 01:05:49.890]  be deep into the
[01:05:49.890 --> 01:05:51.490]  end of two weeks before we want to
[01:05:51.490 --> 01:05:52.650]  plant maybe even longer.
[01:05:53.050 --> 01:05:54.970]  But yeah, just trying to simplify
[01:05:54.970 --> 01:05:56.810]  that because it's like everybody
[01:05:56.810 --> 01:05:58.650]  wants to like add a bunch of stuff
[01:05:58.810 --> 01:05:59.970]  to everything.
[01:05:59.970 --> 01:06:02.170]  And there's a product for this
[01:06:02.170 --> 01:06:03.370]  and a product for that.
[01:06:03.370 --> 01:06:04.730]  And, you know.
[01:06:06.090 --> 01:06:08.370]  It works like we've achieved
[01:06:08.370 --> 01:06:10.290]  like 95 percent success
[01:06:10.290 --> 01:06:11.930]  doing what we're doing on cloning,
[01:06:11.930 --> 01:06:13.650]  probably more like 98 percent
[01:06:15.290 --> 01:06:16.490]  almost every one of those clones
[01:06:16.490 --> 01:06:18.250]  that you just saw is going to root.
[01:06:18.650 --> 01:06:20.210]  And the reason is that we're not
[01:06:20.210 --> 01:06:21.410]  adding a bunch of junk in there
[01:06:21.410 --> 01:06:23.210]  because when we
[01:06:23.210 --> 01:06:25.250]  add we've added the junk
[01:06:25.250 --> 01:06:26.970]  in there. So we tried that,
[01:06:27.410 --> 01:06:28.730]  you know, and it failed.
[01:06:28.850 --> 01:06:30.650]  And the reason it failed is because
[01:06:30.650 --> 01:06:32.930]  it went when all nasty
[01:06:32.930 --> 01:06:34.570]  because we put all kinds of weird
[01:06:34.570 --> 01:06:35.570]  stuff in there. So
[01:06:36.530 --> 01:06:37.770]  if we want our clones to be
[01:06:37.770 --> 01:06:39.770]  successful, then then we're going
[01:06:39.770 --> 01:06:41.490]  to keep doing this successful thing
[01:06:41.490 --> 01:06:42.770]  we've been doing. And that's just
[01:06:43.210 --> 01:06:44.450]  tap water and clinics.
[01:06:44.450 --> 01:06:45.930]  And, you know, we don't
[01:06:46.170 --> 01:06:47.770]  sit over. That's what we're doing.
[01:06:47.890 --> 01:06:49.650]  And if you want to make it,
[01:06:49.690 --> 01:06:50.530]  if you want to make a terrible
[01:06:50.810 --> 01:06:52.690]  work, that will work.
[01:06:53.410 --> 01:06:54.690]  You know, do it.
[01:06:55.050 --> 01:06:56.410]  Do it that way. Don't don't add a
[01:06:56.410 --> 01:06:57.410]  bunch of stuff to it.
[01:06:57.410 --> 01:06:58.890]  You know, you want clones that
[01:06:58.890 --> 01:06:59.890]  work.
[01:07:00.450 --> 01:07:01.450]  That's all you got to do.
[01:07:02.330 --> 01:07:04.010]  So Scott,
[01:07:04.370 --> 01:07:05.450]  can we wean them off?
[01:07:05.450 --> 01:07:06.450]  Clonex.
[01:07:07.090 --> 01:07:08.730]  What do you recommend in
[01:07:10.050 --> 01:07:11.770]  well, I mean,
[01:07:12.010 --> 01:07:13.410]  I don't know, like people call it
[01:07:13.410 --> 01:07:15.130]  stuff, flipper baby gel,
[01:07:15.530 --> 01:07:17.130]  like because it damages your DNA.
[01:07:17.130 --> 01:07:18.570]  But I mean, I don't know what else
[01:07:18.570 --> 01:07:19.570]  to do.
[01:07:20.330 --> 01:07:22.050]  I think in this situation, this is
[01:07:22.050 --> 01:07:23.410]  what I'm talking about, about moving
[01:07:23.410 --> 01:07:24.970]  the blocks of sustainability.
[01:07:24.970 --> 01:07:26.770]  And so they're using
[01:07:26.770 --> 01:07:27.970]  an aero clone or so they're not
[01:07:27.970 --> 01:07:28.970]  using rock wool.
[01:07:29.010 --> 01:07:30.290]  That's a positive for
[01:07:30.290 --> 01:07:31.290]  sustainability.
[01:07:32.050 --> 01:07:32.930]  They're not using any of the
[01:07:32.930 --> 01:07:34.730]  chemicals, which I think is shocking
[01:07:34.730 --> 01:07:36.330]  to people. But like I said, I come
[01:07:36.330 --> 01:07:38.130]  from a region where they would just
[01:07:38.170 --> 01:07:39.410]  aero clone with tap water.
[01:07:40.450 --> 01:07:41.450]  I don't know. And.
[01:07:43.210 --> 01:07:44.410]  And so they're using that.
[01:07:44.450 --> 01:07:46.090]  And but for them, it allows them to
[01:07:46.090 --> 01:07:47.570]  get the plant counts they need
[01:07:48.250 --> 01:07:50.210]  in that space with good plants.
[01:07:50.210 --> 01:07:51.370]  So I think the aero clone is
[01:07:51.370 --> 01:07:52.930]  fantastic. So at the end of that
[01:07:53.290 --> 01:07:55.210]  road, you're using Clonex,
[01:07:55.850 --> 01:07:57.170]  but you're consistent and you're
[01:07:57.170 --> 01:07:58.410]  able to stay in business.
[01:07:58.450 --> 01:07:59.450]  OK, now we'll move
[01:08:00.330 --> 01:08:01.970]  towards moving away from Clonex.
[01:08:02.010 --> 01:08:03.010]  But.
[01:08:03.490 --> 01:08:04.850]  You know, there's interesting we got
[01:08:04.850 --> 01:08:06.290]  an opportunity to sit in on a
[01:08:07.490 --> 01:08:08.930]  conversation with lighting from
[01:08:08.930 --> 01:08:09.730]  Phillips.
[01:08:09.730 --> 01:08:10.730]  And they actually did.
[01:08:11.850 --> 01:08:12.810]  I think it's in Canada.
[01:08:12.810 --> 01:08:13.850]  If you're going to be organically
[01:08:13.850 --> 01:08:15.210]  certified, you can't use any of the
[01:08:15.210 --> 01:08:16.290]  rooting hormones. So they're having
[01:08:16.290 --> 01:08:17.450]  to figure out how to do it without
[01:08:17.450 --> 01:08:18.450]  rooting hormones.
[01:08:18.890 --> 01:08:20.410]  And they're doing it with light
[01:08:20.410 --> 01:08:21.170]  spectrum.
[01:08:21.170 --> 01:08:22.170]  So that's kind of cool.
[01:08:22.570 --> 01:08:23.970]  I think that's going to be
[01:08:24.810 --> 01:08:26.530]  accessible here soon, I would
[01:08:26.530 --> 01:08:28.490]  think, what those spectrums are
[01:08:28.490 --> 01:08:29.930]  and how to do it.
[01:08:29.970 --> 01:08:31.730]  But I think once that happens,
[01:08:31.730 --> 01:08:33.050]  we can move away from the Clonex.
[01:08:33.050 --> 01:08:34.050]  But.
[01:08:35.050 --> 01:08:36.050]  I don't know.
[01:08:36.210 --> 01:08:37.210]  I don't know. It's everywhere.
[01:08:37.610 --> 01:08:38.250]  I don't know.
[01:08:38.250 --> 01:08:39.730]  A lot of recommendations of Aloe
[01:08:40.370 --> 01:08:41.370]  and Willow.
[01:08:41.610 --> 01:08:42.610]  Well, yeah.
[01:08:42.730 --> 01:08:44.050]  In the comments, when people are
[01:08:44.050 --> 01:08:45.990]  saying Aloe, that's that's what we
[01:08:45.990 --> 01:08:47.590]  added when we tried without Clonex
[01:08:48.190 --> 01:08:49.790]  that caused them to fail.
[01:08:50.150 --> 01:08:51.150]  The only time stuff
[01:08:52.070 --> 01:08:53.750]  didn't root was when we added that
[01:08:53.830 --> 01:08:55.070]  the Aloe flakes.
[01:08:55.350 --> 01:08:56.070]  Straight rotten.
[01:08:56.070 --> 01:08:57.350]  So, like, I mean.
[01:08:58.390 --> 01:09:00.310]  So, yeah, we don't we
[01:09:00.310 --> 01:09:01.310]  don't want to use Clonex.
[01:09:01.550 --> 01:09:03.310]  I mean, we want to be as like as
[01:09:03.310 --> 01:09:04.590]  sustainable as we can be.
[01:09:04.670 --> 01:09:05.590]  But it works.
[01:09:05.590 --> 01:09:07.690]  And that's what we found success
[01:09:07.690 --> 01:09:08.430]  using.
[01:09:08.430 --> 01:09:10.110]  It's really the only thing
[01:09:10.350 --> 01:09:12.210]  that we enter into the system
[01:09:12.230 --> 01:09:13.230]  that's not organic
[01:09:14.390 --> 01:09:15.350]  or natural.
[01:09:15.350 --> 01:09:16.350]  So,
[01:09:17.190 --> 01:09:18.270]  but, yeah, like Scott said, I mean,
[01:09:18.270 --> 01:09:19.270]  we
[01:09:21.310 --> 01:09:22.630]  and people are recommending that we
[01:09:22.630 --> 01:09:23.630]  use Aloe. I mean,
[01:09:24.510 --> 01:09:25.510]  we tried that.
[01:09:27.070 --> 01:09:28.070]  Yeah. One of the things we wanted to do on.
[01:09:31.150 --> 01:09:31.510]  Go ahead.
[01:09:31.510 --> 01:09:32.510]  Go ahead, Peter.
[01:09:32.910 --> 01:09:33.670]  Well, I was going to say, I don't
[01:09:33.670 --> 01:09:34.310]  want to bash.
[01:09:34.310 --> 01:09:36.610]  I want to have a productive
[01:09:36.610 --> 01:09:37.610]  conversation.
[01:09:37.630 --> 01:09:39.750]  So, you know, I do see people
[01:09:39.750 --> 01:09:41.490]  talk, you know, bash Clonex.
[01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:42.790]  And so it's kind of like, well, what
[01:09:42.790 --> 01:09:43.790]  are alternatives?
[01:09:43.830 --> 01:09:44.830]  And you guys.
[01:09:45.390 --> 01:09:46.930]  Some of the alternatives people are
[01:09:46.930 --> 01:09:47.870]  recommending.
[01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:50.110]  And, you know, that's
[01:09:50.110 --> 01:09:51.430]  to me, that's a fair answer.
[01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:53.070]  It's like we've tried other stuff.
[01:09:53.230 --> 01:09:54.670]  Yeah. We're just trying to be honest
[01:09:54.670 --> 01:09:56.310]  because there's too much too much
[01:09:56.670 --> 01:09:58.510]  like, you know, spin out there.
[01:09:58.630 --> 01:10:00.030]  So, yeah, we're trying to
[01:10:00.790 --> 01:10:01.790]  you know,
[01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:04.750]  like all these people that are
[01:10:04.750 --> 01:10:06.550]  making comments on things
[01:10:06.550 --> 01:10:08.550]  to try is like I
[01:10:08.550 --> 01:10:09.550]  was that guy.
[01:10:09.790 --> 01:10:11.750]  Like, I am still that
[01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:13.910]  guy on the conversations
[01:10:14.230 --> 01:10:15.830]  that me and Jacob have with Scott
[01:10:15.830 --> 01:10:17.510]  and Sarah is that,
[01:10:17.670 --> 01:10:19.830]  you know, I'm on micro grocery
[01:10:19.830 --> 01:10:21.470]  on Reddit and
[01:10:22.430 --> 01:10:24.430]  follow all the same guys
[01:10:24.430 --> 01:10:26.150]  that everybody out there follows on
[01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:27.310]  Instagram.
[01:10:28.150 --> 01:10:29.150]  And people need to
[01:10:29.990 --> 01:10:32.110]  just start telling the truth
[01:10:33.790 --> 01:10:35.350]  about how things are done.
[01:10:36.190 --> 01:10:36.910]  Yeah.
[01:10:36.910 --> 01:10:38.630]  You can you can pretty much guarantee
[01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:40.630]  that Jason has scoured the Internet
[01:10:40.630 --> 01:10:42.150]  for what everybody is talking about.
[01:10:42.190 --> 01:10:43.630]  And they've tried it in their
[01:10:44.190 --> 01:10:46.990]  facility like these are two extremely
[01:10:46.990 --> 01:10:48.910]  adventurous scientists like
[01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:51.670]  they've tried a lot of these
[01:10:52.270 --> 01:10:53.190]  recommendations.
[01:10:53.190 --> 01:10:54.990]  If you put aloe vera into a cloner,
[01:10:54.990 --> 01:10:56.110]  it turns rancid.
[01:10:56.190 --> 01:10:57.710]  Once you mix aloe vera with water,
[01:10:57.710 --> 01:10:59.550]  you have to put it in the refrigerator.
[01:11:00.510 --> 01:11:02.030]  So in the case of a cloner, it won't
[01:11:02.030 --> 01:11:03.950]  work. Some people we've worked with
[01:11:03.950 --> 01:11:05.550]  do full your feed the clones with
[01:11:05.550 --> 01:11:07.710]  aloe vera that sometimes
[01:11:07.710 --> 01:11:09.350]  helps, sometimes delays rooting.
[01:11:11.630 --> 01:11:13.070]  Yeah, we'll do that a little every
[01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:14.310]  now and then. If we're if we're
[01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:16.030]  fully repeating the rest of the room,
[01:11:16.030 --> 01:11:18.030]  you know, I'll spray
[01:11:18.030 --> 01:11:19.190]  a little in there.
[01:11:19.590 --> 01:11:20.590]  Seems and I think it's.
[01:11:20.750 --> 01:11:22.230]  Yeah, I think it's important to note,
[01:11:22.230 --> 01:11:24.310]  too, that like ClonX is the only
[01:11:24.310 --> 01:11:26.350]  weird thing y'all are using.
[01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:28.350]  Like you don't use pesticides.
[01:11:28.390 --> 01:11:29.990]  You don't use fungicides.
[01:11:30.590 --> 01:11:32.150]  You're using really high quality
[01:11:32.270 --> 01:11:34.110]  plant based nutrients and some,
[01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:35.790]  you know, really.
[01:11:37.190 --> 01:11:38.910]  Yeah. So we led with
[01:11:38.990 --> 01:11:40.990]  with the worst thing
[01:11:40.990 --> 01:11:42.830]  that we're using. So I'll be honest
[01:11:42.830 --> 01:11:44.630]  with people. Everything else is
[01:11:44.630 --> 01:11:45.630]  a yeah.
[01:11:45.790 --> 01:11:47.630]  Yeah. We're not using any pesticides.
[01:11:47.790 --> 01:11:48.790]  We're using biological.
[01:11:48.790 --> 01:11:50.230]  Still tear you apart, though.
[01:11:50.270 --> 01:11:52.230]  You're like we do ninety nine point
[01:11:52.230 --> 01:11:53.830]  nine nine nine percent.
[01:11:53.830 --> 01:11:55.830]  Things that you believe in.
[01:11:55.870 --> 01:11:58.230]  We do zero zero one percent.
[01:11:58.230 --> 01:11:59.750]  And you're going to be real with
[01:11:59.750 --> 01:12:00.750]  people, you know.
[01:12:00.950 --> 01:12:02.670]  But yeah, we use a lot of beneficials,
[01:12:02.670 --> 01:12:04.630]  you know, use all the
[01:12:04.830 --> 01:12:07.070]  the insects to prevent
[01:12:07.070 --> 01:12:09.190]  problems. You know, we do keep
[01:12:09.190 --> 01:12:11.270]  the management products
[01:12:11.270 --> 01:12:12.710]  on hand if necessary.
[01:12:13.310 --> 01:12:14.990]  To deal with any outbreaks of things,
[01:12:16.110 --> 01:12:18.270]  you know, be a proper scouting
[01:12:18.270 --> 01:12:19.270]  running.
[01:12:19.550 --> 01:12:20.910]  We want to talk about any of that
[01:12:20.910 --> 01:12:22.150]  stuff. We can go into that stuff.
[01:12:22.190 --> 01:12:23.190]  Kind of what we're doing.
[01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:25.230]  I.P.M. wise or.
[01:12:25.590 --> 01:12:26.590]  Yeah.
[01:12:26.590 --> 01:12:27.590]  We can.
[01:12:28.390 --> 01:12:30.030]  The the cultivars selection, you
[01:12:30.030 --> 01:12:30.670]  know, you're talking about the
[01:12:30.670 --> 01:12:32.190]  mother. So like, you know, in our
[01:12:32.270 --> 01:12:33.870]  that was our mother tent, you know,
[01:12:33.870 --> 01:12:34.870]  we just run,
[01:12:36.030 --> 01:12:37.710]  you know, so so we've got maybe
[01:12:37.710 --> 01:12:38.710]  eight plants in there.
[01:12:39.470 --> 01:12:40.790]  They've been just been alive for
[01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:42.670]  this cycle. So, you know, we'll kind
[01:12:42.670 --> 01:12:43.790]  of pick what we want for the next
[01:12:43.790 --> 01:12:45.430]  cycle and grow it out.
[01:12:45.550 --> 01:12:47.710]  And then usually we'll just reclone
[01:12:47.710 --> 01:12:48.630]  and just replant them.
[01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:49.990]  We don't really keep them alive for
[01:12:49.990 --> 01:12:51.350]  that long in this scenario.
[01:12:51.390 --> 01:12:52.510]  Maybe when we have a little more
[01:12:52.510 --> 01:12:54.430]  room in our greenhouse, we'll
[01:12:54.430 --> 01:12:56.230]  keep longer term mothers.
[01:12:56.270 --> 01:12:57.510]  But, you know, we're just.
[01:12:57.710 --> 01:12:59.870]  So what what's the life of a mother
[01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:01.110]  for you?
[01:13:02.990 --> 01:13:04.790]  You know, it it's just
[01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:06.390]  been like, you know, maybe like a
[01:13:06.390 --> 01:13:08.510]  growth cycle and a half,
[01:13:08.870 --> 01:13:09.990]  you know, at the most, because we're
[01:13:09.990 --> 01:13:11.030]  just running the one room.
[01:13:11.070 --> 01:13:12.270]  So it's everything's in that one
[01:13:12.270 --> 01:13:14.150]  room. And so, well,
[01:13:14.510 --> 01:13:15.710]  you know, when we plant, we're kind
[01:13:15.710 --> 01:13:17.030]  of thinking about what what we're
[01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:18.830]  going to be doing the next row and
[01:13:18.830 --> 01:13:20.030]  and how many clones we're going to
[01:13:20.030 --> 01:13:21.670]  need for that. And we're able to get
[01:13:21.670 --> 01:13:23.470]  those with the amount of mothers that
[01:13:23.470 --> 01:13:24.470]  we have there.
[01:13:24.630 --> 01:13:26.510]  And so, you know,
[01:13:26.590 --> 01:13:28.430]  yeah, about a growth cycle, maybe
[01:13:28.430 --> 01:13:30.070]  like because we're just going to
[01:13:30.230 --> 01:13:31.830]  when we clone the
[01:13:32.270 --> 01:13:33.550]  hundred, you know, the hundred and
[01:13:33.550 --> 01:13:35.430]  fifteen plants or hundred
[01:13:35.430 --> 01:13:37.310]  plants that we're just going to
[01:13:37.310 --> 01:13:38.750]  clone that mother and just replant
[01:13:38.750 --> 01:13:39.750]  one of those clones.
[01:13:39.870 --> 01:13:41.070]  So, you know.
[01:13:42.070 --> 01:13:43.870]  We just kind of keep keep it keep
[01:13:43.870 --> 01:13:45.910]  the cycle going on on that.
[01:13:47.430 --> 01:13:48.830]  And we want to do different things
[01:13:48.830 --> 01:13:50.590]  to say right now we're growing,
[01:13:50.990 --> 01:13:51.950]  you know, like I said, we've grown up
[01:13:51.950 --> 01:13:53.110]  to eight cultivars, we've got
[01:13:53.550 --> 01:13:54.910]  Morningsteep and
[01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:56.510]  Strawberries and Cream.
[01:13:56.510 --> 01:13:58.070]  And the reason why we've selected
[01:13:58.070 --> 01:13:59.870]  those is that that they
[01:14:00.750 --> 01:14:02.310]  you know, they have characteristics
[01:14:02.390 --> 01:14:03.550]  that are suitable for
[01:14:04.990 --> 01:14:06.550]  four by Rosin, which we've been
[01:14:06.550 --> 01:14:07.550]  getting into
[01:14:08.470 --> 01:14:10.110]  and as well as
[01:14:10.430 --> 01:14:11.550]  they're just beautiful flower.
[01:14:11.550 --> 01:14:12.990]  And so kind of the best of both
[01:14:12.990 --> 01:14:13.990]  worlds with those.
[01:14:13.990 --> 01:14:15.750]  We're just trying to select, you
[01:14:15.750 --> 01:14:16.790]  know, some of the genetics that we
[01:14:16.790 --> 01:14:18.910]  have that that met those
[01:14:19.390 --> 01:14:20.630]  parameters. And that's what we're
[01:14:20.630 --> 01:14:22.390]  running with it in the full
[01:14:22.390 --> 01:14:23.710]  room this time with just two
[01:14:23.710 --> 01:14:25.510]  cultivars is that
[01:14:25.950 --> 01:14:26.950]  we've really.
[01:14:27.550 --> 01:14:29.430]  So we're doing phenol hunts on both.
[01:14:29.790 --> 01:14:31.510]  We did, you know,
[01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:33.230]  we phenol hunted Morningsteep for a
[01:14:33.230 --> 01:14:34.990]  while and picked we called it
[01:14:34.990 --> 01:14:36.590]  Morningsteep 92, which is the one
[01:14:36.590 --> 01:14:37.590]  that we're running with.
[01:14:37.870 --> 01:14:38.910]  You can see those are a little more
[01:14:38.910 --> 01:14:40.110]  consistent in the room.
[01:14:40.110 --> 01:14:41.390]  But then with the Strawberries and
[01:14:41.390 --> 01:14:44.150]  Cream, you know, Jason
[01:14:45.310 --> 01:14:46.750]  makes seeds and
[01:14:47.310 --> 01:14:48.790]  we talk a bunch of seeds and
[01:14:48.790 --> 01:14:50.670]  selected and now we're growing out
[01:14:50.670 --> 01:14:52.270]  50 different
[01:14:52.870 --> 01:14:53.670]  in that room.
[01:14:53.670 --> 01:14:55.510]  And we're going to select from
[01:14:55.510 --> 01:14:57.350]  that and then hopefully
[01:14:57.350 --> 01:14:58.550]  have a little more consistent
[01:15:00.110 --> 01:15:02.230]  phenotyping on that variety.
[01:15:02.390 --> 01:15:03.390]  So that's
[01:15:04.150 --> 01:15:04.830]  what we're growing.
[01:15:04.830 --> 01:15:05.910]  What we're growing right now is,
[01:15:06.630 --> 01:15:07.790]  you know, Jason selected all of our
[01:15:07.790 --> 01:15:08.790]  genetics.
[01:15:09.070 --> 01:15:10.550]  Based on terpenes and
[01:15:11.470 --> 01:15:12.950]  we've got really terp heavy stuff.
[01:15:13.550 --> 01:15:15.870]  We're hitting terp levels for
[01:15:15.990 --> 01:15:16.990]  five percent
[01:15:18.270 --> 01:15:20.070]  on on indoor,
[01:15:20.950 --> 01:15:22.350]  really interesting flavors and
[01:15:22.350 --> 01:15:23.710]  things. And so that's kind of what
[01:15:23.710 --> 01:15:24.510]  we're going for.
[01:15:24.510 --> 01:15:25.710]  But, you know, we're finding that
[01:15:26.390 --> 01:15:28.510]  potency is more important
[01:15:28.510 --> 01:15:29.910]  in the Oklahoma market than
[01:15:29.910 --> 01:15:31.390]  terpenes, which is frustrating.
[01:15:31.390 --> 01:15:33.350]  But in every market.
[01:15:36.230 --> 01:15:37.230]  You're not alone.
[01:15:37.270 --> 01:15:38.270]  Yeah.
[01:15:38.510 --> 01:15:40.470]  Yeah, man, it's been rough
[01:15:41.310 --> 01:15:42.830]  people with their 30 percenters out
[01:15:42.830 --> 01:15:44.590]  there, you know, and we've got
[01:15:44.590 --> 01:15:46.390]  our beautiful,
[01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:47.550]  tasty
[01:15:48.550 --> 01:15:50.110]  blueberry muffins or whatever,
[01:15:50.110 --> 01:15:51.350]  you know, it's not
[01:15:51.830 --> 01:15:52.950]  at 20 percent.
[01:15:52.950 --> 01:15:53.950]  It's laughable.
[01:15:53.990 --> 01:15:54.990]  You know, come on.
[01:15:57.390 --> 01:15:59.150]  But heaven forbid you
[01:15:59.150 --> 01:16:01.030]  smoke some chem dog at 16
[01:16:01.030 --> 01:16:02.790]  percent, you know, man,
[01:16:03.150 --> 01:16:04.830]  I think 16 percent is legit
[01:16:05.110 --> 01:16:06.510]  and smoke, smoke,
[01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:08.350]  a joint at 16 percent, you're going
[01:16:08.350 --> 01:16:09.350]  to feel pretty good about it.
[01:16:12.780 --> 01:16:14.100]  So I have.
[01:16:15.460 --> 01:16:16.900]  Let me just cue this one up.
[01:16:17.900 --> 01:16:19.300]  Can you talk about the
[01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:21.660]  shade cloth and what's going on
[01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:22.660]  here?
[01:16:23.140 --> 01:16:24.220]  Yeah. Jason, you want to talk about
[01:16:24.220 --> 01:16:25.220]  that?
[01:16:25.660 --> 01:16:27.420]  Sure. So, you know,
[01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:28.780]  coming from a tent growing
[01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:29.780]  background, the
[01:16:30.660 --> 01:16:32.740]  screen of green is extremely
[01:16:32.740 --> 01:16:34.740]  popular and
[01:16:35.180 --> 01:16:36.340]  I'm a firm believer in it.
[01:16:36.380 --> 01:16:38.180]  And I think that at home you can
[01:16:38.180 --> 01:16:39.380]  get the biggest yield
[01:16:39.940 --> 01:16:41.460]  with the screen of green
[01:16:42.140 --> 01:16:43.700]  staying under your plant count.
[01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:46.940]  If you can grow a bunch of plants,
[01:16:46.940 --> 01:16:48.220]  I'd probably recommend
[01:16:50.140 --> 01:16:51.140]  the sea of green.
[01:16:52.300 --> 01:16:53.620]  But the screen of green
[01:16:54.420 --> 01:16:56.540]  traditionally we've grown where,
[01:16:57.420 --> 01:16:58.900]  you know, the plant grows up, it
[01:16:58.900 --> 01:17:00.620]  hits the screen, then you get this
[01:17:00.620 --> 01:17:02.380]  growth that goes out like this and
[01:17:02.380 --> 01:17:03.660]  then it gets all the shoots and then
[01:17:03.660 --> 01:17:05.420]  it comes up and it grows.
[01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:07.380]  And so the last
[01:17:07.620 --> 01:17:09.820]  three runs we've done, that's
[01:17:09.820 --> 01:17:11.660]  the method that we went with.
[01:17:12.820 --> 01:17:14.860]  This time we
[01:17:15.220 --> 01:17:17.260]  use the trellis screen plus
[01:17:17.260 --> 01:17:18.260]  the shade cloth.
[01:17:18.780 --> 01:17:21.100]  And what this does is it allows
[01:17:21.100 --> 01:17:23.100]  all of those lowers to come up
[01:17:23.100 --> 01:17:24.300]  and hit the screen.
[01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:26.180]  And Scott, you want to talk
[01:17:26.180 --> 01:17:28.180]  about where you saw that and
[01:17:28.780 --> 01:17:29.780]  what that's all about?
[01:17:30.340 --> 01:17:31.820]  Yeah. So this comes from a guy.
[01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:32.860]  You can put the picture back.
[01:17:34.780 --> 01:17:35.860]  You don't want to be on camera.
[01:17:36.820 --> 01:17:37.700]  They're trying to they're not trying
[01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:38.700]  to see me, but
[01:17:39.780 --> 01:17:41.340]  so I learned this from
[01:17:42.020 --> 01:17:43.780]  Shored, who he goes by
[01:17:43.780 --> 01:17:45.700]  Gene Finder OG on Instagram.
[01:17:47.260 --> 01:17:48.820]  I think this is genius.
[01:17:49.780 --> 01:17:51.460]  Some people in the commercial space
[01:17:51.460 --> 01:17:53.140]  don't take it seriously and maybe
[01:17:53.140 --> 01:17:54.100]  talk bad about it.
[01:17:54.100 --> 01:17:55.980]  But like, I really do think
[01:17:55.980 --> 01:17:57.980]  this is a genius solution to
[01:17:58.300 --> 01:17:59.700]  an obstacle in the commercial
[01:17:59.700 --> 01:18:00.980]  cultivation space.
[01:18:00.980 --> 01:18:03.060]  And, you know, it allows
[01:18:03.060 --> 01:18:04.980]  a couple of guys to string these
[01:18:04.980 --> 01:18:06.860]  out and have a remarkably even
[01:18:06.860 --> 01:18:07.860]  canopy.
[01:18:08.940 --> 01:18:10.540]  I think it saves time a little bit,
[01:18:10.540 --> 01:18:11.820]  too, because most people love to
[01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:13.660]  feverishly rip off branches
[01:18:14.380 --> 01:18:15.940]  and then they try to grow them back.
[01:18:15.940 --> 01:18:17.140]  And this way you leave them on the
[01:18:17.140 --> 01:18:19.060]  bottom and set the shade
[01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:21.020]  screen and those lowers come
[01:18:21.020 --> 01:18:22.780]  up. And I think you can get to the
[01:18:22.980 --> 01:18:24.460]  finish line a little bit quicker
[01:18:25.020 --> 01:18:26.980]  in some certain instances.
[01:18:26.980 --> 01:18:29.100]  So I think there's some drawbacks
[01:18:29.100 --> 01:18:30.340]  and some obstacles to it.
[01:18:30.380 --> 01:18:31.980]  But I still think it's a really cool
[01:18:31.980 --> 01:18:32.980]  tool.
[01:18:33.860 --> 01:18:35.820]  Yeah, we've seen that the plants
[01:18:35.820 --> 01:18:37.740]  that we don't cut on
[01:18:38.220 --> 01:18:40.300]  or early on are more
[01:18:40.300 --> 01:18:41.740]  vigorous. And so
[01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:44.620]  this this time around, we didn't
[01:18:44.620 --> 01:18:46.340]  cut on them until,
[01:18:46.580 --> 01:18:48.060]  you know, two weeks into flower.
[01:18:50.380 --> 01:18:52.140]  Yeah, and so we're trying different
[01:18:52.140 --> 01:18:53.860]  stuff here, you know, we don't know
[01:18:54.220 --> 01:18:55.220]  all the answers.
[01:18:55.940 --> 01:18:57.820]  We didn't come on here to say we did.
[01:18:57.820 --> 01:18:59.780]  You know, we're just
[01:18:59.780 --> 01:19:00.940]  trying to highlight what we're trying
[01:19:00.940 --> 01:19:02.740]  to do and and using the screens
[01:19:02.980 --> 01:19:05.220]  is just it's an innovative
[01:19:05.220 --> 01:19:06.820]  thing that we thought
[01:19:07.300 --> 01:19:09.460]  would help us with with what is,
[01:19:09.980 --> 01:19:12.060]  you know, kind of a very
[01:19:13.380 --> 01:19:15.300]  kind of under talked about
[01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:16.620]  part of cannabis growing, which is
[01:19:16.620 --> 01:19:18.020]  just canopy management in general.
[01:19:18.020 --> 01:19:19.780]  And so, you know, we
[01:19:21.100 --> 01:19:23.300]  you know, it influences everything.
[01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:25.420]  So, I mean, from your your treatments
[01:19:25.420 --> 01:19:27.620]  and your spraying to your being
[01:19:27.620 --> 01:19:29.820]  able to see what's what's going on
[01:19:29.820 --> 01:19:31.820]  and and, you
[01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:33.980]  know, the the light and the
[01:19:33.980 --> 01:19:36.180]  yield and all of that is affected
[01:19:36.180 --> 01:19:38.140]  by the canopy, especially,
[01:19:38.980 --> 01:19:40.780]  you know, in that indoor situation
[01:19:40.780 --> 01:19:42.900]  where, you know, the lights
[01:19:42.900 --> 01:19:44.180]  are above and we're just always
[01:19:44.180 --> 01:19:46.300]  trying to hit as many of those
[01:19:46.300 --> 01:19:47.540]  colors as we can.
[01:19:47.540 --> 01:19:49.580]  And so this allows it to to
[01:19:50.260 --> 01:19:51.860]  like like Scott said, it does save us
[01:19:51.860 --> 01:19:52.980]  a little bit of time because,
[01:19:54.060 --> 01:19:55.660]  you know, we really were in there a
[01:19:55.660 --> 01:19:57.540]  lot kind of stretching and spreading
[01:19:57.860 --> 01:19:58.980]  and trying to keep
[01:19:59.980 --> 01:20:00.980]  things consistent.
[01:20:00.980 --> 01:20:02.220]  And depending on the size of your
[01:20:02.220 --> 01:20:04.220]  trellis, that can be difficult.
[01:20:04.220 --> 01:20:05.260]  You know, if you're running six inch
[01:20:05.260 --> 01:20:06.700]  squares, it can be difficult to really
[01:20:06.700 --> 01:20:07.620]  manage that.
[01:20:07.620 --> 01:20:09.300]  This just kind of takes a lot of that
[01:20:09.300 --> 01:20:11.260]  spreading and just makes
[01:20:11.260 --> 01:20:12.460]  it happen naturally.
[01:20:12.820 --> 01:20:14.420]  And then once you take them off, you
[01:20:14.420 --> 01:20:16.460]  can just kind of do a do a
[01:20:16.460 --> 01:20:18.300]  single spread where you just
[01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:20.380]  kind of run around and and fill
[01:20:20.380 --> 01:20:22.460]  in the gaps and try to try
[01:20:22.460 --> 01:20:24.140]  to get it as even as possible so you
[01:20:24.140 --> 01:20:26.220]  can get the best, the most light
[01:20:26.220 --> 01:20:27.820]  for those plants and get the best
[01:20:28.460 --> 01:20:30.420]  yield. So, you know, this
[01:20:30.420 --> 01:20:31.580]  is the second time we've ran it.
[01:20:31.580 --> 01:20:33.620]  We ran it for 12 days this time
[01:20:33.740 --> 01:20:35.540]  and we might run it longer next time.
[01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:38.900]  And for those and for those that are
[01:20:38.900 --> 01:20:40.780]  wondering, that's 30 percent shade
[01:20:40.780 --> 01:20:41.780]  cloth.
[01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:44.220]  So we
[01:20:44.220 --> 01:20:45.220]  had those custom made.
[01:20:46.460 --> 01:20:48.220]  And it's not expensive.
[01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:51.860]  And I would also like to note that
[01:20:52.900 --> 01:20:54.820]  these two gentlemen are so confident
[01:20:54.820 --> 01:20:56.540]  with regards to powdery mildew
[01:20:57.020 --> 01:20:58.700]  that they just leave that screen on
[01:20:58.700 --> 01:20:59.980]  and they fool your feet through the
[01:20:59.980 --> 01:21:02.420]  screen like they're just reckless,
[01:21:03.340 --> 01:21:04.340]  reckless.
[01:21:05.660 --> 01:21:06.820]  Yeah, we did.
[01:21:08.980 --> 01:21:11.260]  Yeah, yeah, it's risky.
[01:21:11.300 --> 01:21:13.140]  I agree. But no, we did that.
[01:21:14.140 --> 01:21:15.140]  Yeah.
[01:21:15.380 --> 01:21:16.820]  Most people are too afraid to get
[01:21:16.820 --> 01:21:18.340]  mold, but they're not worried about
[01:21:18.340 --> 01:21:19.060]  it.
[01:21:19.060 --> 01:21:20.060]  They're not worried about it.
[01:21:21.180 --> 01:21:22.940]  Someone wanted to see your
[01:21:22.940 --> 01:21:24.540]  your finished flower.
[01:21:26.980 --> 01:21:28.580]  Yeah, yeah, there's one that's
[01:21:29.340 --> 01:21:31.500]  that's from our last grow, the first
[01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:32.580]  full grow of Scott and Sarah.
[01:21:32.580 --> 01:21:34.700]  That's with our first full
[01:21:34.700 --> 01:21:36.420]  living soil. That's super silver
[01:21:36.420 --> 01:21:37.420]  haze.
[01:21:37.540 --> 01:21:39.460]  And then we posted up
[01:21:39.460 --> 01:21:41.660]  another shot of the jellybean.
[01:21:42.940 --> 01:21:44.780]  Few series, a series of shots, if you
[01:21:44.780 --> 01:21:46.540]  can show that here, it's like the
[01:21:46.540 --> 01:21:47.540]  third post there.
[01:21:47.700 --> 01:21:48.700]  It's got the candy.
[01:21:49.980 --> 01:21:52.020]  Yeah, that's a that's
[01:21:52.020 --> 01:21:54.180]  a jellybean, which was, you
[01:21:54.180 --> 01:21:56.100]  know, Jason selected that as
[01:21:56.180 --> 01:21:57.180]  Miss Jill.
[01:21:57.740 --> 01:21:59.380]  And so cool. There's a story behind
[01:21:59.380 --> 01:22:00.180]  all that.
[01:22:00.180 --> 01:22:01.980]  There is with most cultivars, but
[01:22:02.820 --> 01:22:04.620]  it's very, very, you know,
[01:22:04.620 --> 01:22:06.340]  also mean, heavy, very like kind
[01:22:06.340 --> 01:22:08.220]  of juicy,
[01:22:08.220 --> 01:22:09.860]  fruity kind of
[01:22:10.180 --> 01:22:12.140]  kind of terpenes, real, real
[01:22:12.140 --> 01:22:13.740]  high terpenes.
[01:22:13.740 --> 01:22:15.540]  And so, yeah, that's
[01:22:15.540 --> 01:22:16.700]  that's some of the finished stuff
[01:22:16.700 --> 01:22:17.700]  just from our Instagram.
[01:22:20.730 --> 01:22:21.730]  There's a lot of pictures on there.
[01:22:22.170 --> 01:22:23.450]  So the topic
[01:22:24.210 --> 01:22:26.370]  you touched on and throughout there,
[01:22:27.010 --> 01:22:28.290]  I'm going to go to the little boys
[01:22:28.290 --> 01:22:29.290]  room and IPM is
[01:22:30.010 --> 01:22:30.770]  the topic.
[01:22:30.770 --> 01:22:32.330]  I think you guys have this covered
[01:22:32.330 --> 01:22:33.370]  between the four of you.
[01:22:34.370 --> 01:22:35.370]  I think we got it.
[01:22:39.970 --> 01:22:42.170]  Yeah, so I mean, what we're doing
[01:22:42.170 --> 01:22:43.250]  in IPM, I mean,
[01:22:45.050 --> 01:22:47.010]  so, you know, growing
[01:22:47.010 --> 01:22:48.650]  healthy plants and number one, like
[01:22:49.090 --> 01:22:51.170]  number one, growing healthy
[01:22:51.170 --> 01:22:53.090]  plants and healthy soil
[01:22:54.210 --> 01:22:55.210]  and using.
[01:22:56.170 --> 01:22:58.210]  You know, biologically
[01:22:58.210 --> 01:23:00.490]  complete compost to ensure
[01:23:00.490 --> 01:23:03.250]  that those microbial populations
[01:23:03.450 --> 01:23:05.650]  in the soil are adequate,
[01:23:06.450 --> 01:23:08.370]  not only to do the nutrient cycling,
[01:23:08.370 --> 01:23:10.290]  but to balance that system, because
[01:23:10.690 --> 01:23:13.090]  if if we start like mixing
[01:23:13.090 --> 01:23:15.250]  up cocktails of sugars
[01:23:15.250 --> 01:23:16.890]  and molasses and all these things
[01:23:17.210 --> 01:23:18.730]  and dumping it on the soil, that's
[01:23:18.730 --> 01:23:21.250]  going to cause an imbalance
[01:23:21.250 --> 01:23:23.370]  and in that system that
[01:23:23.370 --> 01:23:26.370]  can lead to problems
[01:23:26.370 --> 01:23:27.490]  and it will lead to problems.
[01:23:27.970 --> 01:23:30.330]  And so that's the beginning of IPM
[01:23:30.330 --> 01:23:31.730]  for us is healthy
[01:23:32.250 --> 01:23:33.570]  plants and healthy soil.
[01:23:33.690 --> 01:23:35.690]  And past that,
[01:23:35.690 --> 01:23:37.690]  you know, it's scouting,
[01:23:37.690 --> 01:23:39.570]  it's observation,
[01:23:39.930 --> 01:23:41.210]  early intervention,
[01:23:41.770 --> 01:23:44.250]  preventative beneficial
[01:23:44.250 --> 01:23:45.250]  insects.
[01:23:46.210 --> 01:23:47.730]  You know, so regardless of,
[01:23:48.090 --> 01:23:49.450]  you know, we've been working with
[01:23:49.450 --> 01:23:50.530]  sound horticulture,
[01:23:51.490 --> 01:23:53.290]  having our our bugs shipped
[01:23:53.290 --> 01:23:54.290]  overnight from Oregon
[01:23:54.930 --> 01:23:56.330]  and we'll run
[01:23:57.490 --> 01:23:58.970]  it. So it's cost more to ship them
[01:23:58.970 --> 01:24:00.330]  than the bugs cost themselves.
[01:24:00.330 --> 01:24:01.330]  But
[01:24:02.570 --> 01:24:04.730]  you know, it's that's
[01:24:04.730 --> 01:24:06.450]  a consistent organization that we
[01:24:06.450 --> 01:24:07.850]  that we enjoy working with.
[01:24:07.890 --> 01:24:09.890]  And so, yes, I just ordered
[01:24:09.890 --> 01:24:11.770]  some we run for
[01:24:11.770 --> 01:24:13.930]  aphids, which is the number one,
[01:24:14.210 --> 01:24:16.250]  I'd say, besides powdery mildew
[01:24:17.130 --> 01:24:18.570]  aphid management.
[01:24:18.570 --> 01:24:20.130]  You know, we're just trying to
[01:24:20.970 --> 01:24:21.770]  you know, we're dipping.
[01:24:21.770 --> 01:24:23.850]  So we dip dip clones, dip
[01:24:23.850 --> 01:24:25.330]  plants when we plant them
[01:24:26.330 --> 01:24:27.730]  because we've had experiences where
[01:24:27.730 --> 01:24:29.690]  we brought brought aphids in
[01:24:30.530 --> 01:24:32.650]  on clones that we took from outside.
[01:24:33.250 --> 01:24:35.210]  We've had issues where we got
[01:24:35.210 --> 01:24:36.770]  aphids before we were doing our own
[01:24:36.770 --> 01:24:37.770]  cloning.
[01:24:37.770 --> 01:24:39.610]  And then so just managing that
[01:24:39.930 --> 01:24:41.010]  like right now, we're running
[01:24:41.930 --> 01:24:44.010]  a predatory aphid midge
[01:24:44.410 --> 01:24:46.330]  aphid elites, aphid elites.
[01:24:46.330 --> 01:24:47.850]  I'm not sure exactly how to say it,
[01:24:47.850 --> 01:24:48.610]  but we run those.
[01:24:48.610 --> 01:24:49.610]  We run the AMATs,
[01:24:50.690 --> 01:24:51.970]  which are a
[01:24:52.930 --> 01:24:55.050]  predatory wasp, a parasitic
[01:24:55.050 --> 01:24:55.810]  wasp.
[01:24:55.810 --> 01:24:57.650]  And both of these are kind of like
[01:24:57.650 --> 01:24:58.650]  seek and destroy
[01:25:00.170 --> 01:25:01.450]  beneficials that will kind of just
[01:25:01.450 --> 01:25:02.850]  run around and find anything.
[01:25:02.850 --> 01:25:04.410]  And if they don't, then
[01:25:06.570 --> 01:25:07.410]  great.
[01:25:07.410 --> 01:25:08.730]  And so we kind of run those and then
[01:25:08.730 --> 01:25:10.530]  we'll run lacewing larva.
[01:25:11.370 --> 01:25:12.650]  So, you know, I just
[01:25:13.410 --> 01:25:15.250]  released a thousand lacewing
[01:25:15.250 --> 01:25:15.970]  larva the other day.
[01:25:15.970 --> 01:25:17.170]  I'll release another thousand in a
[01:25:17.170 --> 01:25:18.170]  couple of weeks.
[01:25:18.250 --> 01:25:20.250]  And that's, you know, it's for
[01:25:20.250 --> 01:25:21.690]  prevention because, you know.
[01:25:22.970 --> 01:25:24.770]  We that's
[01:25:24.770 --> 01:25:26.090]  where that's where you can really
[01:25:26.090 --> 01:25:27.890]  make make the differences
[01:25:27.890 --> 01:25:28.890]  at the beginning.
[01:25:29.370 --> 01:25:31.490]  And so so that's that's for
[01:25:31.490 --> 01:25:33.010]  aphids. I mean, and then if we get
[01:25:33.010 --> 01:25:34.930]  them, you know, we see
[01:25:34.930 --> 01:25:36.810]  them, we may use some kind
[01:25:36.810 --> 01:25:38.850]  of organic knockdown spray,
[01:25:38.850 --> 01:25:40.370]  you know, use different things
[01:25:40.810 --> 01:25:41.810]  to deal with them.
[01:25:42.290 --> 01:25:44.170]  And then, you know, if
[01:25:44.170 --> 01:25:45.170]  we actually have
[01:25:46.090 --> 01:25:47.890]  aphids, we'll run the very
[01:25:47.930 --> 01:25:49.810]  bossy on in
[01:25:49.810 --> 01:25:51.250]  some kind of a sticky
[01:25:51.690 --> 01:25:52.970]  substance just to kind of,
[01:25:53.530 --> 01:25:54.530]  you know, so we'll run that.
[01:25:54.530 --> 01:25:55.530]  We'll run.
[01:25:57.290 --> 01:25:58.610]  So that's just we need to knock
[01:25:58.610 --> 01:26:00.450]  down, which we have in the past.
[01:26:00.450 --> 01:26:02.210]  But, you know, right
[01:26:02.210 --> 01:26:03.210]  now we're doing really well with
[01:26:03.210 --> 01:26:04.210]  just prevention
[01:26:05.370 --> 01:26:07.130]  and then as far as like powdery
[01:26:07.130 --> 01:26:09.090]  mildew, you know, we do
[01:26:09.450 --> 01:26:10.770]  we do foliar feeding,
[01:26:11.370 --> 01:26:13.650]  you know, to keep up until
[01:26:14.210 --> 01:26:15.210]  a certain point.
[01:26:15.490 --> 01:26:17.250]  And in that process, you know,
[01:26:18.490 --> 01:26:20.290]  we will inoculate the
[01:26:20.290 --> 01:26:21.450]  leaf surface as well.
[01:26:22.330 --> 01:26:23.850]  And as far as teas go, I mean,
[01:26:23.850 --> 01:26:25.090]  that's a huge subject that we're
[01:26:25.090 --> 01:26:26.850]  not we're not going to get too
[01:26:26.850 --> 01:26:28.530]  much into. But we actually
[01:26:28.650 --> 01:26:30.530]  Scott and Sarah make a tea
[01:26:30.530 --> 01:26:32.170]  that they actually
[01:26:32.690 --> 01:26:34.010]  look at and make sure has
[01:26:34.010 --> 01:26:35.930]  everything in it that it needs
[01:26:35.930 --> 01:26:37.370]  and not the bad stuff.
[01:26:37.370 --> 01:26:38.730]  And so we've actually used their
[01:26:38.730 --> 01:26:39.650]  tea.
[01:26:39.650 --> 01:26:41.570]  We don't make our own tea here.
[01:26:41.850 --> 01:26:43.450]  We actually just use some other,
[01:26:43.730 --> 01:26:45.130]  you know, there's a lot of
[01:26:45.130 --> 01:26:47.010]  microbial supplements
[01:26:47.370 --> 01:26:49.130]  that you can use.
[01:26:49.130 --> 01:26:50.130]  And so we make
[01:26:51.050 --> 01:26:52.450]  sure that the leaf surface is
[01:26:52.450 --> 01:26:53.610]  healthy, too, and that if we do
[01:26:53.610 --> 01:26:54.810]  have to spray anything
[01:26:55.850 --> 01:26:57.250]  that we also come back and make
[01:26:57.250 --> 01:26:58.250]  sure that that if
[01:26:59.090 --> 01:27:00.890]  that's something that has a known
[01:27:00.890 --> 01:27:02.410]  detrimental effect to
[01:27:02.850 --> 01:27:04.210]  leaf surface microbes,
[01:27:04.770 --> 01:27:06.370]  then because we want the balance,
[01:27:06.370 --> 01:27:07.610]  you know, so it's all these things
[01:27:07.610 --> 01:27:09.170]  are just about the balance and the
[01:27:09.170 --> 01:27:09.930]  diversity.
[01:27:09.930 --> 01:27:11.730]  And so but then, you know,
[01:27:12.810 --> 01:27:14.850]  so we try to the diversity
[01:27:15.090 --> 01:27:16.090]  keeps things from getting out of
[01:27:16.090 --> 01:27:16.690]  control.
[01:27:16.690 --> 01:27:18.490]  And so you kind of keep
[01:27:18.730 --> 01:27:20.370]  keep a little bit of diversity,
[01:27:20.410 --> 01:27:22.170]  both in soil and
[01:27:22.250 --> 01:27:24.170]  at the on the plant
[01:27:24.170 --> 01:27:25.930]  itself and just don't
[01:27:25.930 --> 01:27:26.970]  do things that harm that.
[01:27:26.970 --> 01:27:28.250]  And so that's that's the thing is
[01:27:28.250 --> 01:27:29.930]  like, you know, if we're going
[01:27:29.930 --> 01:27:32.050]  to grow
[01:27:32.050 --> 01:27:34.010]  in living soil and try to grow
[01:27:34.290 --> 01:27:36.170]  healthy plants, then
[01:27:36.570 --> 01:27:37.850]  and we don't want to be spraying a
[01:27:37.850 --> 01:27:39.370]  bunch of things on there that
[01:27:39.810 --> 01:27:41.970]  that that kills
[01:27:41.970 --> 01:27:43.850]  micro, you know, so so
[01:27:43.850 --> 01:27:45.530]  that's so we found
[01:27:45.730 --> 01:27:47.850]  that doing these things
[01:27:49.850 --> 01:27:51.130]  will prevent most of these problems.
[01:27:51.130 --> 01:27:52.970]  But but I can't
[01:27:52.970 --> 01:27:54.170]  I can't stress enough the
[01:27:54.690 --> 01:27:55.690]  the.
[01:27:56.450 --> 01:27:58.370]  Just the healthy, healthy soil
[01:27:58.370 --> 01:28:00.130]  and the healthy nutrition,
[01:28:00.130 --> 01:28:01.690]  because part of what what we're
[01:28:01.690 --> 01:28:03.050]  doing that's different than other
[01:28:03.050 --> 01:28:04.050]  people is that we're,
[01:28:04.850 --> 01:28:06.810]  you know, our
[01:28:06.810 --> 01:28:08.570]  soil is not just my, you
[01:28:08.570 --> 01:28:10.570]  know, getting the micro
[01:28:12.050 --> 01:28:13.290]  treatment. You know, it's also
[01:28:13.290 --> 01:28:14.410]  getting the mineral balance and
[01:28:14.410 --> 01:28:15.530]  the nutrition and the things that
[01:28:15.530 --> 01:28:16.530]  the plants need.
[01:28:16.530 --> 01:28:18.130]  So, you know, working with Scott,
[01:28:18.130 --> 01:28:20.130]  he's able to analyze
[01:28:20.130 --> 01:28:21.770]  our soil and make sure that it's
[01:28:21.770 --> 01:28:22.650]  got everything in there.
[01:28:22.650 --> 01:28:24.210]  And so we're not going to have like
[01:28:24.210 --> 01:28:25.930]  a nutrient deficiency because if we
[01:28:25.930 --> 01:28:27.650]  have because we have
[01:28:27.650 --> 01:28:29.490]  a solid program that
[01:28:29.490 --> 01:28:31.130]  we've developed and worked really
[01:28:31.130 --> 01:28:32.970]  hard at making sure
[01:28:32.970 --> 01:28:34.570]  our plants have the nutrition that
[01:28:34.570 --> 01:28:36.450]  they need and when they
[01:28:36.450 --> 01:28:38.050]  have the nutrition that they need
[01:28:38.050 --> 01:28:39.930]  and it's available, then
[01:28:39.930 --> 01:28:41.450]  they don't give out those signals
[01:28:41.450 --> 01:28:43.250]  of alarm that
[01:28:43.290 --> 01:28:44.570]  attract the bugs.
[01:28:44.570 --> 01:28:46.330]  They don't allow the things to
[01:28:46.330 --> 01:28:47.210]  get out of control.
[01:28:47.210 --> 01:28:48.810]  And so we've seen that in our
[01:28:48.810 --> 01:28:49.970]  garden over and over again.
[01:28:49.970 --> 01:28:51.690]  I mean, the healthy plants, you
[01:28:51.690 --> 01:28:53.210]  know, the bugs aren't interested.
[01:28:53.210 --> 01:28:55.050]  And so, you know,
[01:28:55.050 --> 01:28:56.530]  there are chemical signals
[01:28:56.530 --> 01:28:58.330]  happening and all those things that
[01:28:58.330 --> 01:29:00.170]  we we
[01:29:00.170 --> 01:29:01.970]  don't think about as humans that
[01:29:01.970 --> 01:29:02.970]  are happening
[01:29:03.490 --> 01:29:05.210]  on a small scale there.
[01:29:05.210 --> 01:29:07.050]  When a plant is in distress,
[01:29:07.050 --> 01:29:09.250]  you know, it's going to be
[01:29:09.250 --> 01:29:11.170]  put just like when we cut our grass
[01:29:11.170 --> 01:29:13.210]  and we smell the hormone
[01:29:13.210 --> 01:29:14.730]  that the grass is producing.
[01:29:14.730 --> 01:29:16.650]  You know, the plant is in distress
[01:29:16.650 --> 01:29:18.490]  and it attracts
[01:29:18.490 --> 01:29:19.850]  things that are bad.
[01:29:19.850 --> 01:29:21.290]  So just keeping the plants as
[01:29:21.290 --> 01:29:22.290]  healthy as possible
[01:29:23.130 --> 01:29:25.210]  has really gone a long way to
[01:29:25.210 --> 01:29:26.650]  preventing problems.
[01:29:26.650 --> 01:29:28.770]  But but we do
[01:29:28.770 --> 01:29:30.330]  deal with with problems.
[01:29:30.330 --> 01:29:31.810]  I mean, it's any kind of
[01:29:32.690 --> 01:29:33.850]  any kind of cultivation.
[01:29:33.850 --> 01:29:35.050]  I mean, you got to deal with it.
[01:29:35.050 --> 01:29:36.810]  So, yeah, I
[01:29:36.810 --> 01:29:38.730]  think most people have no
[01:29:38.730 --> 01:29:40.530]  clue how
[01:29:40.530 --> 01:29:42.410]  problematic they're given
[01:29:43.010 --> 01:29:44.890]  choice or practices actually
[01:29:44.890 --> 01:29:46.290]  are to their overall goals.
[01:29:46.290 --> 01:29:48.570]  You know, and people don't realize
[01:29:48.570 --> 01:29:51.010]  that that regular application
[01:29:51.010 --> 01:29:52.770]  of something for powdery mildew can
[01:29:52.770 --> 01:29:54.810]  strip the beneficial organisms off
[01:29:54.810 --> 01:29:56.690]  the leaves and actually create
[01:29:56.690 --> 01:29:58.330]  the vulnerability for powdery
[01:29:58.330 --> 01:29:59.330]  mildew.
[01:29:59.930 --> 01:30:01.490]  And there's a lot of products that
[01:30:01.490 --> 01:30:03.330]  people use that negatively impact
[01:30:03.330 --> 01:30:05.090]  soil communities, which negatively
[01:30:05.090 --> 01:30:07.090]  impacts nutrient cycling, which
[01:30:07.090 --> 01:30:09.010]  negatively affects
[01:30:09.010 --> 01:30:10.930]  water holding capacity, which
[01:30:10.930 --> 01:30:12.210]  turns things anaerobic.
[01:30:12.210 --> 01:30:13.890]  And so by trying to.
[01:30:15.010 --> 01:30:16.690]  Constantly go in there and spray for
[01:30:16.690 --> 01:30:18.690]  pests were more often
[01:30:18.690 --> 01:30:20.610]  than not creating the conditions
[01:30:20.610 --> 01:30:22.410]  for pests and disease, even
[01:30:22.410 --> 01:30:24.410]  nutritionally or biologically
[01:30:24.410 --> 01:30:25.410]  in the system.
[01:30:26.210 --> 01:30:27.050]  Or both. Yeah.
[01:30:27.050 --> 01:30:28.610]  Or both at the same time, really.
[01:30:29.650 --> 01:30:31.730]  And so by making more calculated
[01:30:31.730 --> 01:30:33.450]  decisions in the behaviors,
[01:30:34.890 --> 01:30:36.650]  you know, significantly different
[01:30:36.650 --> 01:30:38.170]  outcome can be available.
[01:30:38.530 --> 01:30:40.850]  You know, it does take a tremendous
[01:30:40.850 --> 01:30:41.850]  amount of.
[01:30:44.050 --> 01:30:45.810]  What would you say, gumption or
[01:30:46.930 --> 01:30:47.930]  you know, paradigm shift.
[01:30:47.970 --> 01:30:50.130]  It's it's definitely a mentality
[01:30:50.130 --> 01:30:52.330]  shift to go from constantly
[01:30:52.330 --> 01:30:53.890]  wanting to spray to kill
[01:30:54.210 --> 01:30:56.210]  to supporting life in your garden.
[01:30:56.250 --> 01:30:58.370]  And usually I think honestly,
[01:30:58.730 --> 01:31:00.530]  the transition in that mindset is
[01:31:00.530 --> 01:31:02.090]  actually the most difficult part
[01:31:02.090 --> 01:31:03.330]  about the process.
[01:31:04.370 --> 01:31:06.290]  Nutritionally and all that isn't
[01:31:06.330 --> 01:31:08.210]  that complex, really, if you know
[01:31:08.210 --> 01:31:09.690]  which targets you're going for.
[01:31:11.850 --> 01:31:13.210]  And that's you know, there's a whole
[01:31:13.250 --> 01:31:15.130]  whole whole different situation
[01:31:15.130 --> 01:31:15.930]  outdoor, you know.
[01:31:15.930 --> 01:31:18.010]  So we did we did grow outdoor
[01:31:19.290 --> 01:31:20.050]  this last year.
[01:31:20.050 --> 01:31:21.050]  And so that that
[01:31:21.890 --> 01:31:22.890]  that's a different program.
[01:31:22.890 --> 01:31:24.410]  So we're talking about, you know,
[01:31:24.690 --> 01:31:26.650]  being able to be not not completely
[01:31:26.650 --> 01:31:28.490]  different, but there's a little more
[01:31:28.490 --> 01:31:30.170]  prevention going on when when you're
[01:31:30.170 --> 01:31:31.930]  dealing with the 70 percent nightly
[01:31:31.930 --> 01:31:34.730]  humidity in July.
[01:31:34.770 --> 01:31:37.090]  So that's a different conversation.
[01:31:37.170 --> 01:31:38.890]  And we were successful doing that as
[01:31:38.890 --> 01:31:39.490]  well.
[01:31:40.370 --> 01:31:41.810]  Yeah, it's crazy how y'all are trying
[01:31:41.810 --> 01:31:44.010]  to grow flowers and it'd be like 90
[01:31:44.010 --> 01:31:45.530]  percent humidity for seven straight
[01:31:45.530 --> 01:31:47.930]  days like it's coming from
[01:31:48.210 --> 01:31:49.890]  coming from dry desert California.
[01:31:49.890 --> 01:31:51.130]  I don't even understand how that can
[01:31:51.130 --> 01:31:52.410]  physically happen, but
[01:31:53.570 --> 01:31:55.050]  it's not even hands off to
[01:31:55.450 --> 01:31:56.930]  outdoor Oklahoma growers out there
[01:31:56.930 --> 01:31:58.330]  that were successful because
[01:32:00.330 --> 01:32:01.690]  there were there were a lot that were
[01:32:01.690 --> 01:32:03.810]  not. And it's not an easy
[01:32:03.810 --> 01:32:04.810]  thing to do.
[01:32:04.810 --> 01:32:06.010]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:32:06.730 --> 01:32:07.730]  For sure.
[01:32:08.690 --> 01:32:10.210]  What if what have been some of your
[01:32:10.210 --> 01:32:11.610]  favorite genetics that you guys have
[01:32:11.610 --> 01:32:13.490]  grown? Because I know compared to most
[01:32:13.490 --> 01:32:14.730]  growers, you guys have done a lot of
[01:32:14.730 --> 01:32:16.650]  work with seeds and trying to create
[01:32:16.650 --> 01:32:17.610]  your own cultivars.
[01:32:17.610 --> 01:32:19.650]  And I believe, like you said,
[01:32:19.650 --> 01:32:21.250]  you've got 50 different phenos of
[01:32:21.690 --> 01:32:23.090]  cookies and cream in that room right
[01:32:23.090 --> 01:32:24.410]  now. Is that what you said earlier?
[01:32:24.490 --> 01:32:25.890]  So raising cream, Jason,
[01:32:27.090 --> 01:32:29.210]  cream like 50 different
[01:32:29.210 --> 01:32:31.290]  cultivars in 18 or
[01:32:31.450 --> 01:32:32.890]  nine lights, you know, that's, you
[01:32:32.890 --> 01:32:34.690]  know, you know, yeah, that's a lot
[01:32:34.690 --> 01:32:35.690]  going on.
[01:32:36.690 --> 01:32:37.690]  Well, yeah, sure.
[01:32:38.530 --> 01:32:40.330]  So the strawberries and cream
[01:32:40.530 --> 01:32:42.810]  started out from exotic
[01:32:42.810 --> 01:32:43.810]  genetics.
[01:32:47.490 --> 01:32:49.570]  Just, you know, started
[01:32:49.570 --> 01:32:50.810]  out with a pack of seeds,
[01:32:51.810 --> 01:32:53.970]  found the male female, smashed
[01:32:53.970 --> 01:32:55.410]  them together, pollen chucked them
[01:32:55.890 --> 01:32:56.890]  and ended up
[01:32:57.770 --> 01:32:58.770]  with about 400
[01:32:59.730 --> 01:33:00.730]  seeds.
[01:33:01.850 --> 01:33:04.250]  We germinated all of those
[01:33:04.690 --> 01:33:06.650]  in the middle of the summer on a
[01:33:06.650 --> 01:33:08.530]  hundred degree day and
[01:33:09.090 --> 01:33:11.210]  over 90 percent of them germinated
[01:33:11.530 --> 01:33:12.890]  and lived
[01:33:13.970 --> 01:33:16.170]  the majority of their lives outdoors.
[01:33:18.050 --> 01:33:20.050]  We did start several of them indoors
[01:33:20.450 --> 01:33:21.970]  in those little cloner tents that you
[01:33:21.970 --> 01:33:23.050]  guys saw earlier.
[01:33:23.570 --> 01:33:24.570]  And so
[01:33:25.490 --> 01:33:26.490]  then we used
[01:33:27.370 --> 01:33:29.290]  the outdoor season last
[01:33:29.290 --> 01:33:31.370]  year to put the
[01:33:31.370 --> 01:33:33.210]  four inches outside and we were able
[01:33:33.210 --> 01:33:34.210]  to sex them.
[01:33:34.330 --> 01:33:36.250]  And so then we took the clones
[01:33:36.250 --> 01:33:37.130]  from that.
[01:33:37.130 --> 01:33:39.170]  All the girls took them back inside.
[01:33:39.610 --> 01:33:41.490]  And while we're waiting on our
[01:33:41.490 --> 01:33:43.490]  last run to finish, we kind of had
[01:33:43.490 --> 01:33:45.850]  to reclone them several times.
[01:33:45.850 --> 01:33:47.930]  And so what was left was
[01:33:47.930 --> 01:33:49.690]  50 of the strongest.
[01:33:49.690 --> 01:33:50.690]  And so
[01:33:51.730 --> 01:33:53.050]  we did end up
[01:33:54.010 --> 01:33:56.170]  flowering out about 15
[01:33:56.290 --> 01:33:57.290]  of
[01:33:58.330 --> 01:34:00.250]  the last phenos that
[01:34:00.250 --> 01:34:01.250]  we had.
[01:34:01.290 --> 01:34:03.290]  And it ended up being
[01:34:03.490 --> 01:34:05.770]  our probably our favorite cultivar
[01:34:05.770 --> 01:34:07.370]  of about the
[01:34:07.770 --> 01:34:09.970]  20 or so that we've grown so far.
[01:34:10.570 --> 01:34:11.570]  And
[01:34:12.450 --> 01:34:14.450]  it's extremely unique and
[01:34:15.410 --> 01:34:17.690]  it's worked well in extraction.
[01:34:18.610 --> 01:34:19.610]  And so
[01:34:20.690 --> 01:34:22.810]  shout out exotic genetics.
[01:34:23.930 --> 01:34:25.330]  The other one Jacob mentioned
[01:34:26.810 --> 01:34:29.210]  Morning Steep, that's Sunset Sherbert
[01:34:29.210 --> 01:34:30.730]  times Purple Punch times Sunday
[01:34:30.730 --> 01:34:31.730]  Driver.
[01:34:33.330 --> 01:34:34.810]  I'm a big fan of the Sunset
[01:34:34.810 --> 01:34:35.810]  Sherbert.
[01:34:36.810 --> 01:34:37.810]  We grew
[01:34:38.610 --> 01:34:39.730]  Sherb Face from
[01:34:40.610 --> 01:34:43.010]  Archive Seed Bank and
[01:34:44.090 --> 01:34:46.090]  that one was another one of our
[01:34:46.090 --> 01:34:47.330]  most favorite plants.
[01:34:47.650 --> 01:34:49.530]  Like it did extremely well
[01:34:49.730 --> 01:34:50.730]  outdoors.
[01:34:51.090 --> 01:34:53.330]  It did extremely well indoors.
[01:34:53.450 --> 01:34:54.730]  It has beautiful buds.
[01:34:54.730 --> 01:34:55.730]  It has the
[01:34:56.530 --> 01:34:58.570]  leaves that are kind of curling
[01:34:58.610 --> 01:34:59.610]  from tracts.
[01:35:00.210 --> 01:35:02.050]  It's got that real big orange
[01:35:02.050 --> 01:35:03.050]  smell.
[01:35:03.130 --> 01:35:04.130]  And, you know,
[01:35:04.770 --> 01:35:06.930]  for her, nothing but good things
[01:35:06.930 --> 01:35:07.930]  about
[01:35:08.930 --> 01:35:10.210]  Archive Seed Bank.
[01:35:11.770 --> 01:35:13.490]  Canerado, he
[01:35:13.570 --> 01:35:15.330]  puts a bunch of gear
[01:35:15.330 --> 01:35:16.250]  out there.
[01:35:16.250 --> 01:35:18.090]  And, you know, since
[01:35:18.090 --> 01:35:19.890]  he's working with so many things,
[01:35:21.450 --> 01:35:23.570]  he's stuff that becomes
[01:35:23.570 --> 01:35:24.570]  popular now.
[01:35:24.770 --> 01:35:26.490]  He's probably crossed it
[01:35:26.810 --> 01:35:28.330]  a year or two ago.
[01:35:29.290 --> 01:35:31.170]  And so we're kind
[01:35:31.170 --> 01:35:32.770]  of working through some of
[01:35:32.770 --> 01:35:34.010]  Canerado's gear.
[01:35:35.530 --> 01:35:36.530]  We've grown the 33
[01:35:37.490 --> 01:35:39.130]  Skittles from Riot Seeds.
[01:35:40.330 --> 01:35:42.170]  It also has the Skittles times
[01:35:42.370 --> 01:35:44.210]  Gelato, as everyone knows.
[01:35:44.210 --> 01:35:46.530]  It's basically a play on on Runts.
[01:35:49.610 --> 01:35:50.610]  I think that
[01:35:51.370 --> 01:35:53.170]  Subcool is going to go down
[01:35:53.170 --> 01:35:54.330]  as probably
[01:35:55.610 --> 01:35:57.450]  one of the most legendary breeders
[01:35:57.450 --> 01:35:58.690]  out there, just because
[01:35:59.650 --> 01:36:01.650]  if you look into into strains
[01:36:01.890 --> 01:36:03.650]  that are extremely terp
[01:36:03.650 --> 01:36:05.490]  heavy, you're going to end up
[01:36:05.490 --> 01:36:07.290]  finding that it's
[01:36:07.290 --> 01:36:09.530]  a lot of Subcool's gear.
[01:36:10.290 --> 01:36:12.050]  And so by way of that,
[01:36:12.050 --> 01:36:13.810]  Ms. Jill has
[01:36:14.130 --> 01:36:15.410]  a lot of that stuff.
[01:36:15.410 --> 01:36:17.130]  And so, like I would say,
[01:36:17.130 --> 01:36:18.290]  the biggest one
[01:36:19.690 --> 01:36:21.650]  that I think is special is
[01:36:21.650 --> 01:36:22.690]  the Space Queen.
[01:36:23.490 --> 01:36:25.090]  She calls it the Space Dude.
[01:36:25.450 --> 01:36:27.210]  And that's what led me to
[01:36:27.210 --> 01:36:29.050]  want to work with
[01:36:29.050 --> 01:36:30.170]  the Jilly Bean.
[01:36:30.370 --> 01:36:32.290]  And it didn't disappoint.
[01:36:32.290 --> 01:36:33.930]  And it's extremely
[01:36:34.410 --> 01:36:35.290]  terp heavy,
[01:36:36.170 --> 01:36:37.410]  not the strongest,
[01:36:38.530 --> 01:36:40.330]  but something that we
[01:36:40.330 --> 01:36:42.050]  want to keep around in
[01:36:42.050 --> 01:36:43.450]  case we want to get that
[01:36:43.930 --> 01:36:45.690]  real orange smell because
[01:36:45.850 --> 01:36:46.970]  the other part of
[01:36:47.890 --> 01:36:49.690]  Jilly Bean is
[01:36:51.130 --> 01:36:52.050]  orange velvet,
[01:36:53.090 --> 01:36:54.930]  which I'm pretty sure
[01:36:54.930 --> 01:36:56.250]  is just California orange.
[01:36:57.330 --> 01:36:59.330]  Um, you know,
[01:36:59.330 --> 01:37:00.730]  look, looking at another
[01:37:01.170 --> 01:37:03.010]  other videos on
[01:37:03.010 --> 01:37:04.290]  the Cannabis Project,
[01:37:04.610 --> 01:37:05.250]  you see
[01:37:07.370 --> 01:37:09.090]  a breeder talk on the
[01:37:09.610 --> 01:37:10.770]  at the Emerald Cup
[01:37:11.130 --> 01:37:13.130]  from Green Source Gardens
[01:37:13.490 --> 01:37:15.250]  and Bio Vortex.
[01:37:15.930 --> 01:37:16.610]  And
[01:37:17.650 --> 01:37:19.450]  I look them up, check them out.
[01:37:19.450 --> 01:37:20.250]  And
[01:37:21.370 --> 01:37:23.690]  Green Source has a ton of
[01:37:24.650 --> 01:37:26.490]  amazing cultivars
[01:37:26.490 --> 01:37:27.730]  that they're working with.
[01:37:28.530 --> 01:37:29.970]  They're amazing farm.
[01:37:30.490 --> 01:37:31.810]  Somebody that
[01:37:33.290 --> 01:37:34.850]  I think we look up to
[01:37:35.290 --> 01:37:36.890]  because they're really doing
[01:37:37.650 --> 01:37:39.290]  the regenerative thing
[01:37:39.490 --> 01:37:40.570]  the right way.
[01:37:41.450 --> 01:37:43.330]  They're working cultivars
[01:37:43.730 --> 01:37:45.530]  the way that they should be worked,
[01:37:45.970 --> 01:37:47.770]  which is, you know,
[01:37:47.810 --> 01:37:49.210]  an inbred line
[01:37:49.650 --> 01:37:51.490]  down to the ninth
[01:37:51.490 --> 01:37:52.330]  generation.
[01:37:52.330 --> 01:37:53.890]  You know, I know that they got
[01:37:53.890 --> 01:37:54.650]  the coffee.
[01:37:55.010 --> 01:37:56.690]  He probably just finished up
[01:37:56.690 --> 01:37:58.130]  the seventh generation.
[01:37:58.850 --> 01:38:00.730]  Bio Vortex has been
[01:38:01.130 --> 01:38:02.410]  back crossing
[01:38:02.730 --> 01:38:04.370]  and crossing the black dog
[01:38:04.370 --> 01:38:06.330]  into things for a really
[01:38:06.330 --> 01:38:07.210]  long time.
[01:38:07.850 --> 01:38:09.730]  And so we
[01:38:09.730 --> 01:38:11.370]  really wanted to run
[01:38:12.730 --> 01:38:13.650]  black dog.
[01:38:13.650 --> 01:38:15.290]  We wanted to run coffee
[01:38:16.090 --> 01:38:16.890]  and
[01:38:17.650 --> 01:38:19.650]  we weren't disappointed by those at all.
[01:38:20.890 --> 01:38:22.650]  What the black dog offers
[01:38:22.650 --> 01:38:23.930]  is that it's got
[01:38:23.930 --> 01:38:25.770]  amazing structure.
[01:38:25.930 --> 01:38:27.850]  It's got extremely
[01:38:27.850 --> 01:38:28.930]  dense buds
[01:38:29.450 --> 01:38:30.250]  and
[01:38:30.930 --> 01:38:31.930]  the coffee.
[01:38:31.930 --> 01:38:33.730]  The coffee has
[01:38:34.010 --> 01:38:35.650]  giant beautiful buds.
[01:38:36.450 --> 01:38:38.170]  What's really incredible
[01:38:38.170 --> 01:38:39.530]  about the coffee
[01:38:39.810 --> 01:38:41.650]  is that it's got just that
[01:38:41.650 --> 01:38:43.570]  old school dank
[01:38:45.010 --> 01:38:46.250]  flower smell.
[01:38:47.330 --> 01:38:49.010]  It's one of the
[01:38:49.170 --> 01:38:51.010]  only cultivars where
[01:38:52.250 --> 01:38:52.770]  well,
[01:38:53.570 --> 01:38:54.090]  well,
[01:38:58.370 --> 01:39:00.130]  it's I think it's unique in
[01:39:00.130 --> 01:39:02.050]  today's market and that it is one
[01:39:02.050 --> 01:39:04.050]  of those old school strains that
[01:39:04.330 --> 01:39:05.930]  you put it in a bag
[01:39:06.090 --> 01:39:08.050]  and it reeks
[01:39:08.050 --> 01:39:09.610]  up your whole room
[01:39:09.890 --> 01:39:12.290]  and people walk in afterwards
[01:39:12.290 --> 01:39:14.450]  and say, oh, it reeks of weed in here.
[01:39:15.810 --> 01:39:17.690]  So, you know, everything
[01:39:17.690 --> 01:39:19.730]  behind the coffee strain
[01:39:19.770 --> 01:39:21.890]  is really like the alien
[01:39:21.890 --> 01:39:24.370]  kush, the alien technology
[01:39:24.770 --> 01:39:25.610]  and
[01:39:26.210 --> 01:39:27.410]  alien dog.
[01:39:28.250 --> 01:39:29.010]  All of the
[01:39:30.050 --> 01:39:31.770]  alien stuff, I think,
[01:39:32.210 --> 01:39:34.130]  is in most modern
[01:39:34.130 --> 01:39:35.730]  gear in one way
[01:39:35.730 --> 01:39:36.450]  or another.
[01:39:38.210 --> 01:39:39.890]  And it just seemed pretty obvious that
[01:39:39.890 --> 01:39:42.330]  Green Source was going to be crossing
[01:39:42.770 --> 01:39:44.610]  the black dog and the coffee.
[01:39:44.850 --> 01:39:47.410]  So we also did the cross
[01:39:49.290 --> 01:39:51.130]  kind of just in homage to them.
[01:39:51.530 --> 01:39:53.490]  But honestly, just copying them
[01:39:53.490 --> 01:39:54.890]  because we thought, hey,
[01:39:55.490 --> 01:39:57.010]  they're on
[01:39:58.730 --> 01:40:00.730]  the breeder panel at the Emerald Cup.
[01:40:01.010 --> 01:40:02.730]  These guys are the upper echelon.
[01:40:03.010 --> 01:40:04.650]  They know what they're doing.
[01:40:04.850 --> 01:40:06.850]  And if we do the same thing,
[01:40:06.850 --> 01:40:08.730]  will we see the same success?
[01:40:09.330 --> 01:40:11.490]  And, you know, a lot of it goes back
[01:40:11.490 --> 01:40:13.370]  to whenever we first started,
[01:40:13.370 --> 01:40:14.570]  Jacob said, you know,
[01:40:14.930 --> 01:40:17.450]  let's find strains that work outside
[01:40:17.450 --> 01:40:18.250]  and that work
[01:40:19.050 --> 01:40:20.170]  in a greenhouse.
[01:40:20.170 --> 01:40:22.090]  And that's extremely
[01:40:22.330 --> 01:40:23.970]  challenging thing to do
[01:40:23.970 --> 01:40:26.370]  and has led me down a path of
[01:40:26.890 --> 01:40:28.810]  researching genetics for
[01:40:29.690 --> 01:40:30.650]  several years.
[01:40:30.650 --> 01:40:31.290]  And so
[01:40:33.050 --> 01:40:34.970]  we want to keep talking about genetics.
[01:40:34.970 --> 01:40:37.050]  I could keep talking about genetics, but.
[01:40:39.770 --> 01:40:40.970]  Do you guys want to or?
[01:40:42.450 --> 01:40:43.610]  Yes, please.
[01:40:45.610 --> 01:40:47.090]  On behalf of the chat.
[01:40:48.850 --> 01:40:49.850]  They want to keep going.
[01:40:50.970 --> 01:40:52.410]  That black coffee and
[01:40:53.450 --> 01:40:55.210]  that was what went in that picture
[01:40:55.770 --> 01:40:56.970]  in that picture from the
[01:40:58.170 --> 01:40:59.770]  when we zoomed in in the mother tent,
[01:40:59.770 --> 01:41:01.690]  that's actually a revenge of,
[01:41:02.250 --> 01:41:03.490]  you know, the black coffee.
[01:41:03.970 --> 01:41:06.010]  So we cross that, grew it out
[01:41:06.010 --> 01:41:08.570]  and then, you know, pick the best,
[01:41:09.410 --> 01:41:10.610]  you know, the best flowers
[01:41:10.610 --> 01:41:13.090]  and then revenge that and
[01:41:13.730 --> 01:41:15.890]  successfully for the first time
[01:41:16.010 --> 01:41:17.130]  we were able to do it.
[01:41:17.130 --> 01:41:18.930]  The you know, the clone from
[01:41:19.370 --> 01:41:20.250]  the flowering
[01:41:21.010 --> 01:41:22.570]  nearly finished flower plant
[01:41:23.250 --> 01:41:24.290]  right before we harvested,
[01:41:24.290 --> 01:41:25.530]  we took clones.
[01:41:25.530 --> 01:41:27.570]  And so that was kind of cool.
[01:41:27.570 --> 01:41:28.970]  That's why I had that odd structure
[01:41:28.970 --> 01:41:30.730]  with the little there's still remnants
[01:41:30.730 --> 01:41:32.410]  of the flower at the bottom of that plant.
[01:41:32.410 --> 01:41:33.970]  So if anyone sees that part of the video.
[01:41:33.970 --> 01:41:35.050]  And they're like, right, right.
[01:41:35.050 --> 01:41:36.410]  Yeah, I know 100 percent.
[01:41:37.130 --> 01:41:38.090]  Let me bring that up
[01:41:38.090 --> 01:41:39.130]  while you guys are talking.
[01:41:39.130 --> 01:41:39.690]  How is that?
[01:41:39.690 --> 01:41:39.930]  Right.
[01:41:40.770 --> 01:41:41.770]  Let me think about
[01:41:42.650 --> 01:41:43.970]  the revenge, because I mean,
[01:41:43.970 --> 01:41:44.970]  that was that was a big
[01:41:46.090 --> 01:41:46.770]  win for us.
[01:41:46.770 --> 01:41:48.810]  And we finally got that figured out.
[01:41:48.810 --> 01:41:49.810]  We think we can replicate
[01:41:49.810 --> 01:41:51.370]  what we did on the revenge.
[01:41:51.370 --> 01:41:53.570]  But yeah, that that's one of the black
[01:41:53.570 --> 01:41:55.610]  coffee plants that we crossed
[01:41:55.610 --> 01:41:56.770]  that's in that video.
[01:41:56.770 --> 01:41:59.050]  And yeah, that's the remnant of the
[01:41:59.490 --> 01:42:02.050]  of the nug down at the base of it.
[01:42:04.730 --> 01:42:06.290]  People out there to know that
[01:42:06.530 --> 01:42:09.690]  that is definitely possible to.
[01:42:11.330 --> 01:42:13.130]  At the very end of flower,
[01:42:13.570 --> 01:42:15.850]  take any nug that you choose,
[01:42:16.170 --> 01:42:17.690]  chop it and put it in your corner,
[01:42:17.730 --> 01:42:19.010]  and it's going to it's going to
[01:42:19.010 --> 01:42:19.930]  develop roots.
[01:42:20.490 --> 01:42:21.890]  The thing is, is that once you
[01:42:21.890 --> 01:42:23.730]  transplant it, it's going to kind of
[01:42:23.730 --> 01:42:26.170]  just be stalled out for a month or
[01:42:26.170 --> 01:42:28.490]  or two months before it even starts
[01:42:28.490 --> 01:42:31.130]  showing any sign of a veg growth.
[01:42:31.490 --> 01:42:33.450]  And so what you're seeing there is
[01:42:33.450 --> 01:42:35.650]  when we chopped that black
[01:42:35.650 --> 01:42:38.810]  coffee down on October 16th.
[01:42:39.450 --> 01:42:42.130]  And that size of that plant now is
[01:42:42.970 --> 01:42:45.170]  from the clone taken October 16th.
[01:42:45.370 --> 01:42:47.610]  And I have to give a shout out to
[01:42:47.610 --> 01:42:49.370]  Lovin in her eyes on Instagram
[01:42:49.370 --> 01:42:51.610]  because she posted a picture of
[01:42:52.090 --> 01:42:54.890]  a rooted nug and kind of said,
[01:42:54.890 --> 01:42:56.290]  yes, this is possible.
[01:42:56.290 --> 01:42:59.290]  And yeah, so that's what's left
[01:42:59.290 --> 01:43:00.690]  of the of the nug there.
[01:43:01.090 --> 01:43:02.810]  And that's all those little branches
[01:43:02.810 --> 01:43:04.610]  grew out of this grew out of that thing.
[01:43:05.650 --> 01:43:07.730]  We got we got to fix the whole thing.
[01:43:07.730 --> 01:43:10.450]  But yeah, so that's the black coffee
[01:43:10.450 --> 01:43:12.090]  that we crossed.
[01:43:12.090 --> 01:43:13.290]  You know, we're going to try to
[01:43:13.290 --> 01:43:14.690]  run that in the greenhouse
[01:43:14.690 --> 01:43:16.330]  because of the way it performs.
[01:43:17.730 --> 01:43:19.570]  And it's kind of just a question
[01:43:19.570 --> 01:43:21.530]  for the community is that
[01:43:21.530 --> 01:43:23.290]  obviously, like right now,
[01:43:23.610 --> 01:43:26.130]  we are our want to be breeders.
[01:43:27.650 --> 01:43:29.730]  But at what point can we start
[01:43:29.730 --> 01:43:30.930]  calling ourselves breeders?
[01:43:32.330 --> 01:43:34.490]  You know, if we if we
[01:43:34.490 --> 01:43:36.170]  cross the black coffee
[01:43:36.730 --> 01:43:39.290]  into the strawberries and cream
[01:43:39.770 --> 01:43:42.010]  F3 phenos, and then we
[01:43:42.130 --> 01:43:44.170]  F3 pheno that we pick
[01:43:44.450 --> 01:43:46.930]  and we grow that out like can
[01:43:46.930 --> 01:43:48.730]  can we call that our own
[01:43:49.170 --> 01:43:51.810]  or how far do we need to work it
[01:43:51.810 --> 01:43:53.170]  before we can start
[01:43:54.090 --> 01:43:55.530]  calling ourselves a breeder?
[01:43:57.170 --> 01:43:58.370]  And I look forward to
[01:43:58.850 --> 01:43:59.770]  seeing what you guys say
[01:43:59.770 --> 01:44:00.730]  in the chat on that one.
[01:44:00.730 --> 01:44:02.130]  But I say you are.
[01:44:02.690 --> 01:44:04.570]  We've we've worked for a lot of breeders.
[01:44:04.570 --> 01:44:06.410]  Most of them start out their business
[01:44:06.410 --> 01:44:07.410]  with an accidental
[01:44:07.410 --> 01:44:08.850]  hermaphrodite pollination.
[01:44:08.850 --> 01:44:09.730]  That's not really very
[01:44:09.730 --> 01:44:10.930]  calculated or greedy.
[01:44:11.650 --> 01:44:12.930]  So I don't know.
[01:44:12.930 --> 01:44:14.050]  I think you guys are doing it.
[01:44:14.290 --> 01:44:16.770]  And so so, you know,
[01:44:17.210 --> 01:44:17.890]  breeding, you know,
[01:44:18.450 --> 01:44:20.170]  the other thing is that,
[01:44:20.730 --> 01:44:22.410]  you know, if in the future
[01:44:22.410 --> 01:44:24.850]  we do put out seeds to
[01:44:25.450 --> 01:44:26.770]  the Oklahoma market,
[01:44:27.450 --> 01:44:29.810]  what I want to be able to show is that
[01:44:30.450 --> 01:44:31.570]  this is the process
[01:44:31.570 --> 01:44:32.810]  that we went through.
[01:44:33.010 --> 01:44:34.970]  And then, you know, maybe
[01:44:34.970 --> 01:44:37.490]  we only flowered out 50 plants,
[01:44:37.890 --> 01:44:40.170]  but we flowered out 50 plants
[01:44:40.530 --> 01:44:43.570]  and we we got COAs on it
[01:44:43.570 --> 01:44:45.370]  and we know what it can do
[01:44:45.370 --> 01:44:47.050]  and we know the morphology on it.
[01:44:47.570 --> 01:44:48.330]  And
[01:44:49.690 --> 01:44:51.330]  we really took our time
[01:44:51.330 --> 01:44:53.370]  in finding the plant because,
[01:44:53.970 --> 01:44:56.530]  you know, being completely obsessed
[01:44:56.530 --> 01:44:58.170]  with cannabis and in
[01:44:58.170 --> 01:45:00.450]  in researching all of these breeders
[01:45:00.450 --> 01:45:03.130]  and listening to the podcast
[01:45:03.130 --> 01:45:06.010]  and everything that Peter has put out.
[01:45:07.130 --> 01:45:08.770]  It's really obvious
[01:45:08.770 --> 01:45:11.050]  that the majority of breeders out there
[01:45:11.330 --> 01:45:13.130]  are breeding in their closet.
[01:45:13.810 --> 01:45:14.770]  You know, like they're
[01:45:15.050 --> 01:45:16.450]  they're ordering packs.
[01:45:17.330 --> 01:45:19.210]  They're taking the one male they find.
[01:45:19.450 --> 01:45:21.130]  They're smashing into the other thing.
[01:45:21.570 --> 01:45:23.730]  And they're they're calling it,
[01:45:24.050 --> 01:45:25.210]  you know, their strain.
[01:45:25.210 --> 01:45:28.490]  And so like we just have a ton of respect
[01:45:28.490 --> 01:45:32.130]  for, you know, people like Dutch Blooms,
[01:45:33.130 --> 01:45:34.770]  Emerald Mountain Legacy.
[01:45:35.210 --> 01:45:36.610]  All those people out there
[01:45:36.610 --> 01:45:38.170]  that are actually growing
[01:45:38.170 --> 01:45:39.930]  a large plant count,
[01:45:40.450 --> 01:45:42.810]  smelling every flower
[01:45:43.450 --> 01:45:46.010]  and checking out its morphology
[01:45:47.290 --> 01:45:49.290]  and in breeding with it.
[01:45:49.290 --> 01:45:50.690]  And, you know.
[01:45:52.650 --> 01:45:58.520]  It takes a lot of work to do it.
[01:45:58.520 --> 01:46:01.440]  So, yeah, Jason's been really important
[01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:03.240]  in that part of our businesses,
[01:46:03.800 --> 01:46:05.200]  because, yeah, it's just a lot of work.
[01:46:05.200 --> 01:46:07.560]  OK, so so we could go back to,
[01:46:07.560 --> 01:46:10.640]  you know, the whole goal of finding seeds
[01:46:10.640 --> 01:46:13.120]  that will work well outdoors.
[01:46:13.800 --> 01:46:15.240]  Yeah. And so, you know,
[01:46:15.240 --> 01:46:17.720]  after researching it for a long time,
[01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:23.080]  what you're looking for in genetics
[01:46:23.080 --> 01:46:26.880]  is stuff that's been grown and bred
[01:46:26.880 --> 01:46:28.000]  in an environment
[01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:29.920]  that you plan on growing in.
[01:46:29.920 --> 01:46:31.200]  So you're looking for
[01:46:31.200 --> 01:46:32.840]  a plant that's going to be
[01:46:32.840 --> 01:46:33.680]  in an environment
[01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:35.640]  that you plan on growing in.
[01:46:36.280 --> 01:46:39.880]  So if you if you plan on being a hydro
[01:46:39.880 --> 01:46:42.440]  grower, like I would be getting
[01:46:42.720 --> 01:46:44.440]  jungle boy seeds.
[01:46:44.440 --> 01:46:47.720]  Yeah. If you are going to be
[01:46:48.080 --> 01:46:50.240]  an organic living soil farmer,
[01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:52.280]  then I would probably look
[01:46:52.280 --> 01:46:54.520]  at Regenerative Seed Company
[01:46:54.520 --> 01:46:56.440]  or Daga.Love.
[01:46:57.960 --> 01:47:00.120]  Or we could get more specific
[01:47:00.120 --> 01:47:01.640]  if you want to look at
[01:47:01.640 --> 01:47:03.160]  Pacific Northwest roots
[01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:06.120]  or green source gardens.
[01:47:08.680 --> 01:47:10.560]  Especially like an Emerald Mountain
[01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:13.320]  legacy who's been out there
[01:47:13.320 --> 01:47:15.880]  breeding in large plant
[01:47:15.880 --> 01:47:18.520]  counts for a really long time.
[01:47:21.600 --> 01:47:23.000]  And if you look up
[01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:24.760]  the the legend of Mandelbrot,
[01:47:24.760 --> 01:47:27.480]  you kind of get a history of what makes
[01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:30.920]  those genetics special is just that
[01:47:31.400 --> 01:47:33.880]  they're growing in a high
[01:47:33.880 --> 01:47:37.640]  humid environment, outdoors, organically.
[01:47:38.080 --> 01:47:42.400]  And so when we're growing their gear,
[01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:44.560]  it's going to work really well for us,
[01:47:44.560 --> 01:47:45.680]  because in Oklahoma,
[01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:48.480]  we've got high humidity.
[01:47:50.440 --> 01:47:53.440]  And that's that's what they said
[01:47:53.440 --> 01:47:54.600]  is one of their goals
[01:47:54.600 --> 01:47:57.200]  was to be in a high humid area
[01:47:57.640 --> 01:47:59.800]  because it expresses terpenes more.
[01:47:59.800 --> 01:48:02.360]  And so they've kind of selected
[01:48:02.360 --> 01:48:06.200]  for high humidity and grown organically.
[01:48:06.200 --> 01:48:08.800]  And that's some somebody's gear
[01:48:08.800 --> 01:48:10.640]  that we want to use
[01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:13.400]  and incorporate into our stuff.
[01:48:16.720 --> 01:48:19.680]  If people want to know other.
[01:48:20.920 --> 01:48:22.880]  You know, super awesome
[01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:24.000]  breeders out there.
[01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:27.880]  We could talk about that, too.
[01:48:28.160 --> 01:48:29.640]  I think what you touched on
[01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:31.160]  was a really important concept
[01:48:31.160 --> 01:48:33.640]  in that context is everything.
[01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:34.840]  And I think what people
[01:48:34.840 --> 01:48:36.440]  don't really factor in is.
[01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:39.680]  Wherever that genetics is coming from,
[01:48:39.680 --> 01:48:42.040]  there was a cultivation context
[01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:44.160]  that that plant was selected in.
[01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:47.280]  So that given selection was chosen
[01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:48.640]  as a top performer
[01:48:48.640 --> 01:48:50.400]  in the context of that garden.
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.440]  And you can take seeds
[01:48:53.440 --> 01:48:54.920]  that were bred in hydroponics
[01:48:54.920 --> 01:48:56.840]  and make good pot and living soil.
[01:48:57.480 --> 01:49:00.560]  But it still gives you
[01:49:00.560 --> 01:49:03.760]  a tremendous advantage in outcome
[01:49:03.760 --> 01:49:05.240]  if you're in living soil,
[01:49:05.240 --> 01:49:07.800]  growing seeds from a living soil garden.
[01:49:08.040 --> 01:49:10.920]  And I think there's more breeders
[01:49:10.920 --> 01:49:13.280]  doing that than they let on to.
[01:49:14.440 --> 01:49:16.160]  A lot of the first people
[01:49:16.160 --> 01:49:18.200]  that hired me off of Instagram
[01:49:18.520 --> 01:49:20.920]  were actually seed makers, breeders
[01:49:20.920 --> 01:49:21.720]  and whatnot.
[01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:22.600]  And they even though
[01:49:22.600 --> 01:49:23.920]  they were growing in hydro,
[01:49:24.280 --> 01:49:26.320]  they found that doing the seed
[01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:28.520]  making in living soil
[01:49:28.520 --> 01:49:30.600]  led to better seeds, better viability,
[01:49:30.600 --> 01:49:31.520]  better seed weight,
[01:49:32.480 --> 01:49:34.680]  greater vigor, less shenanigans.
[01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:37.520]  So they were still doing the selection
[01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:40.040]  and growing in a salt environment.
[01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:41.800]  But then when they went to make the seeds,
[01:49:41.800 --> 01:49:43.160]  they did it in a no till pot.
[01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:46.680]  And so if a if a plant,
[01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:48.640]  like you said, Jungle Boys was selected
[01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:51.600]  in a high salt, high NPK strategy,
[01:49:52.160 --> 01:49:54.240]  you'll grow it fine in living soil,
[01:49:54.240 --> 01:49:55.200]  but you might not get
[01:49:55.200 --> 01:49:56.720]  some of the same characteristics,
[01:49:57.480 --> 01:49:59.640]  you know, and so I think you're really
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:01.560]  best suited to stick
[01:50:01.560 --> 01:50:03.440]  within the context of your cultivation
[01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:06.720]  and choose from those types of genetics.
[01:50:08.160 --> 01:50:08.520]  You know.
[01:50:10.400 --> 01:50:11.920]  To continue down the line,
[01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:14.400]  then we'll say the next cultivar
[01:50:14.400 --> 01:50:16.840]  found for organic
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:19.480]  kind of outdoor growing
[01:50:19.840 --> 01:50:22.320]  would be the stuff from Green Shock
[01:50:22.320 --> 01:50:24.840]  Farms or the Mendo Do Boys.
[01:50:26.080 --> 01:50:27.440]  I think they placed third
[01:50:27.440 --> 01:50:29.040]  with their tropical sleigh ride.
[01:50:30.440 --> 01:50:33.960]  That's something we're eyeballing and.
[01:50:36.120 --> 01:50:38.560]  Specifically, the Long Valley sleigh ride,
[01:50:39.640 --> 01:50:41.360]  because that's got the Royal Kush
[01:50:41.480 --> 01:50:43.240]  from Emerald Mountain Legacy
[01:50:43.240 --> 01:50:44.160]  that we're big on.
[01:50:46.280 --> 01:50:47.800]  Some other stuff we're looking at
[01:50:47.800 --> 01:50:50.360]  is the grape cream cake
[01:50:50.360 --> 01:50:52.400]  from Bloom Seed Company
[01:50:53.160 --> 01:50:54.520]  that's got the ice cream cake
[01:50:54.520 --> 01:50:56.360]  times the Wedding Crashers.
[01:51:00.480 --> 01:51:02.360]  We're looking at the grape cream cake
[01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:04.440]  for rosin extraction.
[01:51:09.440 --> 01:51:11.360]  Trying to look at the list here
[01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:12.480]  of the other stuff
[01:51:12.480 --> 01:51:14.320]  specifically for outdoors.
[01:51:17.040 --> 01:51:17.880]  Yeah, so I mean,
[01:51:18.840 --> 01:51:20.520]  and we are.
[01:51:22.720 --> 01:51:23.680]  One of the things that we wanted
[01:51:23.680 --> 01:51:25.400]  to accomplish with this call
[01:51:25.400 --> 01:51:26.520]  was just kind of putting it out there
[01:51:26.520 --> 01:51:27.840]  that, you know.
[01:51:29.800 --> 01:51:31.680]  This is this is a difficult thing to do
[01:51:31.680 --> 01:51:33.120]  and that there's a lot of, you know,
[01:51:33.640 --> 01:51:36.280]  ways to accomplish growing cannabis.
[01:51:36.800 --> 01:51:37.400]  And so.
[01:51:38.480 --> 01:51:38.880]  You know.
[01:51:40.640 --> 01:51:41.040]  We.
[01:51:43.160 --> 01:51:43.920]  We just want to kind of
[01:51:44.200 --> 01:51:45.600]  kind of be real people
[01:51:45.600 --> 01:51:46.360]  about what we're doing.
[01:51:46.680 --> 01:51:47.800]  We didn't really get into
[01:51:48.760 --> 01:51:50.240]  the actual growing, but, you know.
[01:51:51.960 --> 01:51:52.760]  We're living soil,
[01:51:52.760 --> 01:51:54.240]  but we are using nutrients
[01:51:54.240 --> 01:51:55.000]  and we just want to be
[01:51:55.240 --> 01:51:56.280]  be clear about that, too.
[01:51:56.280 --> 01:51:57.080]  It's like, you know.
[01:51:58.000 --> 01:51:59.520]  Living soil is a process
[01:51:59.560 --> 01:52:02.600]  and and it takes time.
[01:52:02.880 --> 01:52:04.480]  And we went through the whole thing.
[01:52:05.360 --> 01:52:06.240]  We bought bags.
[01:52:06.240 --> 01:52:09.120]  We, you know, we tested
[01:52:09.640 --> 01:52:10.880]  the organic bags.
[01:52:10.880 --> 01:52:12.560]  We we consulted.
[01:52:12.760 --> 01:52:14.000]  You know, we kind of dealt with what
[01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.600]  what was in there,
[01:52:16.600 --> 01:52:18.480]  trying to improve that situation.
[01:52:19.520 --> 01:52:20.200]  And then, you know,
[01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:20.920]  we went with the living
[01:52:20.920 --> 01:52:22.120]  soil from crested soil.
[01:52:22.120 --> 01:52:24.240]  And now we're kind of developing that.
[01:52:24.240 --> 01:52:25.400]  But, you know, it takes time
[01:52:25.400 --> 01:52:28.520]  and to get that soil mix, you know, to be
[01:52:29.480 --> 01:52:30.440]  it's going to take time.
[01:52:30.440 --> 01:52:31.800]  And so in the meantime,
[01:52:31.800 --> 01:52:32.720]  you know, we supplement,
[01:52:32.720 --> 01:52:35.080]  we balance nutrition.
[01:52:35.080 --> 01:52:36.920]  You know, we're we're top dressing
[01:52:38.240 --> 01:52:40.720]  using all organic soluble powders.
[01:52:41.200 --> 01:52:42.440]  And, you know.
[01:52:43.120 --> 01:52:45.120]  And so we just wanted
[01:52:45.120 --> 01:52:46.200]  to kind of put that out there.
[01:52:46.200 --> 01:52:47.120]  We hadn't really gotten to that.
[01:52:47.120 --> 01:52:48.120]  And then, you know,
[01:52:48.360 --> 01:52:49.880]  when we get into the greenhouse,
[01:52:49.880 --> 01:52:50.960]  you know, in Oklahoma,
[01:52:50.960 --> 01:52:52.600]  there's so much going on in Oklahoma.
[01:52:53.360 --> 01:52:55.320]  You know, we kind of like
[01:52:55.320 --> 01:52:56.800]  like Jason explained before,
[01:52:56.800 --> 01:52:58.400]  you know, we bought that greenhouse
[01:52:58.840 --> 01:53:00.800]  and we weren't
[01:53:01.560 --> 01:53:02.640]  we didn't know what we were doing
[01:53:02.720 --> 01:53:04.160]  when we bought the thing.
[01:53:04.160 --> 01:53:05.920]  And and so we worked with,
[01:53:06.360 --> 01:53:07.560]  you know, some other consultants.
[01:53:07.560 --> 01:53:09.160]  We talked with Eric Brandstad
[01:53:09.160 --> 01:53:09.880]  a little bit about,
[01:53:10.880 --> 01:53:12.080]  you know, greenhouse
[01:53:12.080 --> 01:53:13.480]  growing after the fact.
[01:53:13.480 --> 01:53:15.360]  And we've made some major changes
[01:53:15.360 --> 01:53:17.480]  to how we intend to grow in that greenhouse.
[01:53:17.480 --> 01:53:18.960]  And in part of it is that,
[01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:20.400]  you know, in Oklahoma,
[01:53:21.280 --> 01:53:22.080]  you know, we're going to be able
[01:53:22.080 --> 01:53:23.720]  to control that environment in the winter.
[01:53:23.720 --> 01:53:25.880]  But in the in the summer,
[01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:27.120]  you know, when it heats up,
[01:53:27.640 --> 01:53:28.640]  we're basically going to be growing
[01:53:28.640 --> 01:53:30.840]  outdoors under under a tarp, you know.
[01:53:30.840 --> 01:53:32.400]  And we need to be able to get
[01:53:32.400 --> 01:53:33.560]  all that heat out of there.
[01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:35.560]  And and sometimes
[01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:37.120]  thinking about that
[01:53:37.120 --> 01:53:38.520]  before you buy your greenhouse
[01:53:38.520 --> 01:53:39.760]  and maybe talking to somebody
[01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:42.160]  who we think that would be a good idea.
[01:53:42.160 --> 01:53:43.440]  But going back to the genetics,
[01:53:43.440 --> 01:53:44.800]  what Jason was talking about,
[01:53:45.280 --> 01:53:46.080]  that's why we're looking
[01:53:46.080 --> 01:53:47.120]  for outdoor genetics,
[01:53:47.120 --> 01:53:48.960]  because, I mean, we basically need,
[01:53:49.440 --> 01:53:51.320]  you know, genetics in our greenhouse
[01:53:51.320 --> 01:53:53.240]  that are going to be capable of dealing
[01:53:53.240 --> 01:53:55.680]  with Oklahoma outdoor conditions.
[01:53:59.160 --> 01:54:01.400]  So ice cream cake seems to be standing up
[01:54:01.400 --> 01:54:03.080]  well in greenhouses.
[01:54:05.840 --> 01:54:07.200]  For those out there interested.
[01:54:09.160 --> 01:54:10.440]  So, yeah, and that's part of the black coffee,
[01:54:10.440 --> 01:54:12.160]  we're expecting that it will perform well
[01:54:12.320 --> 01:54:14.880]  and we hope it will in the greenhouse
[01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:16.040]  due to the structure
[01:54:16.040 --> 01:54:17.440]  and the phenose that we selected.
[01:54:19.360 --> 01:54:22.000]  So for someone in Oklahoma.
[01:54:24.280 --> 01:54:26.920]  Where can they find your tasty flower?
[01:54:28.640 --> 01:54:30.160]  Yeah, so, you know, today
[01:54:30.160 --> 01:54:32.560]  you could find it at Okind Cannabis.
[01:54:32.560 --> 01:54:34.120]  It's O-K-I-N-D.
[01:54:35.400 --> 01:54:37.320]  You know, we hope they have some right now
[01:54:37.320 --> 01:54:38.520]  and if they don't, maybe they'll call us.
[01:54:38.520 --> 01:54:41.400]  But Okind Cannabis has been working with us.
[01:54:41.680 --> 01:54:44.200]  Greenway, Greenway Dispensary
[01:54:44.200 --> 01:54:45.600]  has been working with us pretty well.
[01:54:46.680 --> 01:54:48.600]  So that's where we're on the shelf right now.
[01:54:49.160 --> 01:54:51.000]  People could go in the Tulsa area.
[01:54:51.880 --> 01:54:54.320]  Some of our concentrate products,
[01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:56.320]  I think, are pretty much sold through right now.
[01:54:56.320 --> 01:54:59.120]  But yeah, holler at us
[01:54:59.120 --> 01:55:01.320]  because we got we got flower available.
[01:55:01.400 --> 01:55:03.960]  So what are you excited to grow
[01:55:03.960 --> 01:55:06.200]  for the market this season
[01:55:06.200 --> 01:55:08.560]  that that wasn't in the lineup last year?
[01:55:10.960 --> 01:55:12.680]  Probably something with
[01:55:13.440 --> 01:55:15.400]  Tropicana cookies.
[01:55:15.400 --> 01:55:16.520]  OK. Yeah.
[01:55:16.520 --> 01:55:19.880]  I mean, yeah, we're trying to gear towards like.
[01:55:21.040 --> 01:55:24.280]  You know, a concentrate and flower,
[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.520]  you know, anything that that's really putting out
[01:55:28.160 --> 01:55:31.480]  that's dropping, you know, trikes for,
[01:55:32.600 --> 01:55:34.840]  you know, because what we're producing
[01:55:34.960 --> 01:55:37.880]  this living soil grows extremely clean cannabis
[01:55:37.880 --> 01:55:39.360]  and extremely desirable to
[01:55:41.200 --> 01:55:42.040]  two extractors.
[01:55:42.040 --> 01:55:44.840]  And so we're kind of working towards,
[01:55:44.920 --> 01:55:47.320]  you know, kind of a hybrid right now of
[01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:50.320]  a flower and concentrate.
[01:55:50.840 --> 01:55:52.480]  And so we're trying to get genetics
[01:55:52.480 --> 01:55:54.160]  that that'll produce both.
[01:55:54.160 --> 01:55:56.480]  And so, yeah, what Jason's referring to
[01:55:56.480 --> 01:55:58.320]  is kind of where we're going with that.
[01:55:58.320 --> 01:56:00.720]  And but it takes time, you know, it takes time
[01:56:01.160 --> 01:56:02.800]  to grow out those things.
[01:56:02.800 --> 01:56:04.160]  So we we kind of geared up
[01:56:04.160 --> 01:56:06.480]  originally with the preselected genetics
[01:56:06.480 --> 01:56:06.960]  that we had.
[01:56:07.960 --> 01:56:08.880]  A couple of those wound up
[01:56:08.880 --> 01:56:09.840]  fitting that profile.
[01:56:09.840 --> 01:56:11.120]  And so we're running with those now.
[01:56:11.120 --> 01:56:12.600]  But, you know, just takes
[01:56:12.600 --> 01:56:15.280]  it takes time to to get those seeds and pop them
[01:56:15.280 --> 01:56:17.600]  and get them expanded out to.
[01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:19.800]  So, yeah, that's where we're at right now.
[01:56:19.800 --> 01:56:21.920]  It's kind of selecting some different things.
[01:56:21.920 --> 01:56:23.120]  But I agree.
[01:56:23.120 --> 01:56:24.920]  That's what that's where we're headed.
[01:56:24.920 --> 01:56:27.560]  I think a fun, fun tidbit for people out there
[01:56:27.560 --> 01:56:30.320]  is that strawberries and cream,
[01:56:30.360 --> 01:56:33.360]  which exotic genetics is now calling red pop,
[01:56:33.840 --> 01:56:36.760]  is the the strawberry is actually mimosa.
[01:56:40.240 --> 01:56:42.080]  Yeah, and the strawberries and cream
[01:56:42.080 --> 01:56:44.040]  phenol that we're doing.
[01:56:45.440 --> 01:56:46.720]  You know, just in the little
[01:56:46.720 --> 01:56:48.400]  the last group that we did,
[01:56:48.400 --> 01:56:51.000]  we found a couple that that really
[01:56:51.440 --> 01:56:53.400]  we wound up, you know, processing
[01:56:53.400 --> 01:56:54.880]  and we didn't re-veg in that time,
[01:56:54.880 --> 01:56:56.120]  but we're hoping to find
[01:56:56.120 --> 01:56:57.680]  there's some some some phenols
[01:56:57.680 --> 01:57:00.360]  that are really heavy on like the candy
[01:57:00.360 --> 01:57:01.880]  kind of sweet tart
[01:57:01.880 --> 01:57:04.280]  kind of strawberry, sweet tart
[01:57:04.280 --> 01:57:05.000]  kind of taste.
[01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:06.880]  And I mean, there was just a few of them
[01:57:07.080 --> 01:57:08.560]  and we were hoping to find another one.
[01:57:08.560 --> 01:57:09.720]  So if we can find that
[01:57:09.720 --> 01:57:12.160]  and get that into production,
[01:57:12.640 --> 01:57:13.760]  that would that would be awesome.
[01:57:15.040 --> 01:57:17.680]  So I've got the I've got the.
[01:57:18.960 --> 01:57:22.280]  F2 male pollen saved in the freezer,
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.160]  we're growing the F3 generation,
[01:57:25.600 --> 01:57:27.040]  but we've already grown
[01:57:27.040 --> 01:57:28.840]  some of the F3 generation
[01:57:29.240 --> 01:57:31.000]  and made F4 seeds,
[01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.720]  and so we're sitting on about 600
[01:57:34.280 --> 01:57:36.400]  of the F4 strawberries and cream.
[01:57:37.400 --> 01:57:39.760]  And so kind of the plan is, is that
[01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:42.600]  once we select the one out of the 50,
[01:57:42.920 --> 01:57:45.000]  we're going to try to back cross
[01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:46.120]  with the male pollen
[01:57:46.120 --> 01:57:48.000]  that's about a year old now.
[01:57:48.760 --> 01:57:50.040]  And then if that doesn't work,
[01:57:50.320 --> 01:57:51.400]  we're going to go through
[01:57:51.400 --> 01:57:54.440]  and find a stud male in the F4
[01:57:54.800 --> 01:57:56.000]  and then bring it back
[01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.280]  because strawberries and cream
[01:57:58.280 --> 01:58:00.120]  isn't a giant yielder,
[01:58:00.520 --> 01:58:03.120]  but the buds look amazing.
[01:58:03.120 --> 01:58:05.560]  And there's some of the most dense buds
[01:58:06.600 --> 01:58:07.760]  I've ever seen.
[01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.600]  And the smells are really crazy,
[01:58:10.600 --> 01:58:13.120]  ranging from a strawberry
[01:58:13.120 --> 01:58:16.080]  and to the smell I really like is this dough.
[01:58:16.480 --> 01:58:18.200]  This is straight dough smell.
[01:58:18.560 --> 01:58:20.360]  I like strawberry sugar cookies
[01:58:20.360 --> 01:58:21.240]  or something like that.
[01:58:23.360 --> 01:58:25.400]  And it's just extremely strong,
[01:58:26.280 --> 01:58:28.640]  kind of cuts through everything
[01:58:28.640 --> 01:58:29.640]  else that you're smoking.
[01:58:30.560 --> 01:58:32.040]  And once we got it tested,
[01:58:32.040 --> 01:58:35.320]  we found out it's actually high in CBG.
[01:58:35.720 --> 01:58:37.200]  So we think it's really got
[01:58:37.200 --> 01:58:38.880]  a lot of medicinal qualities.
[01:58:40.640 --> 01:58:41.440]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:58:41.880 --> 01:58:42.840]  Yeah, and those smells, I mean,
[01:58:43.040 --> 01:58:44.760]  some of them are like strawberry milk,
[01:58:44.760 --> 01:58:47.840]  it's like sour milk, even
[01:58:48.400 --> 01:58:49.480]  almost like sour milk.
[01:58:49.480 --> 01:58:50.480]  And then some of them are like,
[01:58:50.720 --> 01:58:52.160]  you know, straight up sweet tarts.
[01:58:52.160 --> 01:58:53.800]  And so there's a lot of variation
[01:58:54.760 --> 01:58:56.640]  in that that we're hoping
[01:58:56.640 --> 01:58:57.880]  to expand a little.
[01:58:59.080 --> 01:59:00.720]  So someone asked, you know,
[01:59:00.720 --> 01:59:03.360]  you always think about local geography
[01:59:03.360 --> 01:59:04.880]  and the shit you deal with
[01:59:06.720 --> 01:59:09.960]  plant structure in the windy
[01:59:10.360 --> 01:59:11.800]  Oklahoma environment.
[01:59:13.080 --> 01:59:15.000]  Is that important in your decision making?
[01:59:16.520 --> 01:59:16.960]  Oh, yeah.
[01:59:17.120 --> 01:59:18.880]  No, I mean, yeah,
[01:59:19.720 --> 01:59:20.720]  the wind definitely comes
[01:59:20.720 --> 01:59:22.120]  sweeping down the plain here.
[01:59:22.280 --> 01:59:23.640]  And that's that's no joke.
[01:59:24.120 --> 01:59:25.520]  And but, you know, we're not
[01:59:25.520 --> 01:59:27.480]  the only growers dealing with wind.
[01:59:27.480 --> 01:59:28.760]  I mean, I think they got that
[01:59:28.760 --> 01:59:29.720]  in California, too.
[01:59:30.200 --> 01:59:33.440]  And but, you know, it is quite windy.
[01:59:33.440 --> 01:59:33.840]  I think,
[01:59:35.760 --> 01:59:36.440]  you know, looking at
[01:59:36.440 --> 01:59:37.880]  because we grew eight different things
[01:59:37.880 --> 01:59:39.200]  out the world last year, too,
[01:59:39.200 --> 01:59:40.000]  or maybe nine.
[01:59:40.240 --> 01:59:42.560]  And, yeah, some didn't do well at all
[01:59:42.560 --> 01:59:43.680]  and some did pretty well.
[01:59:44.360 --> 01:59:46.680]  You know, trellising is obviously I mean,
[01:59:47.200 --> 01:59:47.960]  but the structure,
[01:59:47.960 --> 01:59:49.080]  like with the black dog, I mean,
[01:59:49.760 --> 01:59:51.440]  it really does have a structure
[01:59:51.440 --> 01:59:53.840]  that's intended for strength.
[01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.760]  And so that's why we cross black dog
[01:59:57.520 --> 01:59:59.000]  because part partially
[01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:00.400]  was because of that structure.
[02:00:00.400 --> 02:00:02.360]  It it supports itself.
[02:00:02.360 --> 02:00:04.680]  And the breeder that we were
[02:00:06.280 --> 02:00:07.480]  that we got that from
[02:00:08.280 --> 02:00:09.560]  that that was his intent.
[02:00:10.080 --> 02:00:12.160]  Their intent as well was to to breed
[02:00:12.160 --> 02:00:13.720]  something that had strong
[02:00:13.720 --> 02:00:15.960]  self-supporting colors.
[02:00:15.960 --> 02:00:17.720]  And so so you can see that
[02:00:17.960 --> 02:00:19.680]  that you can see that in that
[02:00:19.920 --> 02:00:20.920]  in that variety.
[02:00:21.360 --> 02:00:22.840]  And so structure wise, yeah,
[02:00:22.920 --> 02:00:24.000]  that that was.
[02:00:24.360 --> 02:00:27.000]  And then also, I mean, but but yeah,
[02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:28.240]  there's a lot of other considerations
[02:00:28.240 --> 02:00:30.000]  for outdoor besides the wind.
[02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:30.400]  I mean.
[02:00:31.520 --> 02:00:33.760]  You know, we we we wound up
[02:00:33.760 --> 02:00:35.040]  with some really, really thick
[02:00:36.760 --> 02:00:37.960]  colors that that,
[02:00:38.560 --> 02:00:39.560]  you know, didn't really
[02:00:40.280 --> 02:00:41.160]  didn't do so well.
[02:00:41.160 --> 02:00:42.920]  So also even just like the
[02:00:43.360 --> 02:00:44.560]  the spacing of the nuts,
[02:00:44.560 --> 02:00:46.520]  I mean, like the black, the black coffee
[02:00:47.240 --> 02:00:48.920]  or the black dog also has good
[02:00:49.160 --> 02:00:51.320]  good kind of spacing where,
[02:00:51.320 --> 02:00:52.440]  you know, you can get
[02:00:53.320 --> 02:00:55.360]  they can be allowed to dry out.
[02:00:55.360 --> 02:00:56.080]  I mean, because when you
[02:00:56.520 --> 02:00:58.040]  when the humidity is is
[02:00:58.520 --> 02:01:00.240]  when there's dew every morning in
[02:01:00.240 --> 02:01:02.040]  July or for 40 days
[02:01:02.040 --> 02:01:03.560]  straight in July,
[02:01:04.960 --> 02:01:06.320]  that's that's rough, you know.
[02:01:06.320 --> 02:01:07.680]  And I mean, it was
[02:01:08.480 --> 02:01:10.320]  it hit that dew point every night,
[02:01:10.360 --> 02:01:11.080]  you know.
[02:01:11.080 --> 02:01:13.000]  And so, yeah, you're
[02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:14.040]  dealing with a lot of water
[02:01:14.640 --> 02:01:15.640]  on the plants.
[02:01:15.640 --> 02:01:17.200]  It's like a Florida summer.
[02:01:17.760 --> 02:01:19.760]  And yeah, it just it varies
[02:01:19.760 --> 02:01:21.760]  a lot. I mean, but but yeah,
[02:01:21.760 --> 02:01:23.520]  those nighttime humidities in Oklahoma
[02:01:23.520 --> 02:01:25.320]  are really, really difficult.
[02:01:26.440 --> 02:01:27.440]  And they're worth.
[02:01:29.560 --> 02:01:31.440]  Shout out to Jesse Bob Vortex
[02:01:31.440 --> 02:01:32.840]  for that black dog, Cush, though, we
[02:01:32.840 --> 02:01:34.640]  grew we
[02:01:34.640 --> 02:01:36.400]  grew two crosses of a black
[02:01:36.400 --> 02:01:38.160]  dog, Cush, by Gasly from
[02:01:38.160 --> 02:01:39.680]  one of our friends, and
[02:01:40.360 --> 02:01:41.800]  he doesn't really label what they
[02:01:41.800 --> 02:01:43.760]  are. He just says a black dog, Cush
[02:01:43.920 --> 02:01:44.920]  cross. And even
[02:01:45.960 --> 02:01:47.640]  before the flowers really started
[02:01:47.640 --> 02:01:49.400]  to form during that growth cycle,
[02:01:49.400 --> 02:01:50.440]  said, I don't even care what this
[02:01:50.440 --> 02:01:51.600]  flower turns out with.
[02:01:51.600 --> 02:01:53.320]  I would mono the whole garden with
[02:01:53.320 --> 02:01:55.440]  this genetics like it
[02:01:55.440 --> 02:01:56.200]  just grows.
[02:01:56.200 --> 02:01:57.720]  It just does the canopy management
[02:01:57.720 --> 02:01:58.720]  and structure for you.
[02:01:58.720 --> 02:01:59.760]  And then just at the end, I just
[02:01:59.760 --> 02:02:01.160]  stuck a single pipe and tied it
[02:02:01.160 --> 02:02:03.120]  down and a piece of bamboo
[02:02:03.120 --> 02:02:05.400]  is just was like really impressive
[02:02:05.400 --> 02:02:06.880]  structure and just
[02:02:07.520 --> 02:02:08.320]  so tolerant.
[02:02:08.320 --> 02:02:09.600]  It's like that Cadillac that just
[02:02:09.600 --> 02:02:11.560]  kind of cruises along, you know,
[02:02:11.720 --> 02:02:12.920]  doesn't get too out of whack.
[02:02:13.520 --> 02:02:14.520]  Awesome.
[02:02:15.120 --> 02:02:16.840]  Yeah, we put over those
[02:02:17.240 --> 02:02:18.760]  eight foot trails and we put
[02:02:18.880 --> 02:02:20.280]  trellis cages around all of our
[02:02:20.280 --> 02:02:21.280]  outdoor plants.
[02:02:22.440 --> 02:02:24.080]  And I mean,
[02:02:24.320 --> 02:02:25.400]  if we hadn't, they would have been
[02:02:25.400 --> 02:02:26.440]  on the ground. So, I mean,
[02:02:27.560 --> 02:02:28.680]  you got to support them.
[02:02:28.760 --> 02:02:29.880]  I mean, no doubt about that.
[02:02:29.960 --> 02:02:31.600]  And, you know, we looked off
[02:02:31.600 --> 02:02:33.160]  of kind of what mean Jean was doing
[02:02:33.880 --> 02:02:36.040]  and in California,
[02:02:36.200 --> 02:02:38.080]  mean Jean gave us a tip
[02:02:38.080 --> 02:02:39.800]  on which wire to use.
[02:02:39.800 --> 02:02:41.240]  And so, yeah,
[02:02:42.160 --> 02:02:43.760]  I mean, we only had like one branch
[02:02:43.760 --> 02:02:44.760]  break, I think.
[02:02:45.280 --> 02:02:47.200]  So we didn't have any serious storms
[02:02:47.200 --> 02:02:48.200]  this last season.
[02:02:48.680 --> 02:02:50.320]  We actually there were some some
[02:02:50.320 --> 02:02:51.840]  pretty winter storms that came in
[02:02:51.840 --> 02:02:53.120]  that we had harvested before that.
[02:02:53.760 --> 02:02:54.760]  In October.
[02:02:56.280 --> 02:02:57.280]  Yeah.
[02:02:58.240 --> 02:02:59.240]  Well, it's just
[02:03:00.760 --> 02:03:01.760]  past 10 a.m.
[02:03:01.960 --> 02:03:03.000]  on the West Coast.
[02:03:03.040 --> 02:03:04.800]  Is that a good time to wrap?
[02:03:04.840 --> 02:03:05.840]  So we can all.
[02:03:07.040 --> 02:03:08.280]  Get some work done today.
[02:03:09.040 --> 02:03:10.040]  Sure.
[02:03:10.160 --> 02:03:12.520]  And so tomorrow
[02:03:12.520 --> 02:03:14.480]  morning, we're
[02:03:14.640 --> 02:03:16.720]  going to do a garden tour with
[02:03:16.960 --> 02:03:19.000]  Dragon with Matches up in Humboldt.
[02:03:20.160 --> 02:03:21.160]  Oh, nice. Sweet.
[02:03:21.200 --> 02:03:22.200]  That is a
[02:03:22.760 --> 02:03:23.760]  8 a.m.
[02:03:24.080 --> 02:03:25.560]  Pacific time.
[02:03:25.600 --> 02:03:26.600]  And Mr.
[02:03:26.600 --> 02:03:27.680]  Toad, I see you in the chat.
[02:03:27.680 --> 02:03:29.600]  I keep wanting to do Mr.
[02:03:29.600 --> 02:03:31.200]  Toad specifically at night.
[02:03:31.960 --> 02:03:33.760]  And I literally cannot stay awake
[02:03:33.760 --> 02:03:35.640]  past eight like my two year old
[02:03:36.560 --> 02:03:38.480]  does not want to go to bed until
[02:03:38.480 --> 02:03:40.640]  like 10. So I literally fall asleep
[02:03:40.640 --> 02:03:42.240]  either on the couch or in my bed
[02:03:42.240 --> 02:03:43.400]  with her still awake.
[02:03:43.840 --> 02:03:45.960]  And then my wife kicks me to go
[02:03:45.960 --> 02:03:47.760]  deal with her and get her to
[02:03:47.760 --> 02:03:48.760]  bed. But like
[02:03:49.600 --> 02:03:51.160]  at night, I'm just like
[02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:54.880]  yeah, so because it's like a good
[02:03:54.880 --> 02:03:55.880]  time to do
[02:03:56.760 --> 02:03:58.680]  shows and watch
[02:03:58.720 --> 02:04:00.280]  everyone's hanging out at home.
[02:04:00.760 --> 02:04:02.000]  Good time to watch stuff.
[02:04:03.360 --> 02:04:04.360]  But I'm working
[02:04:05.200 --> 02:04:06.640]  on trying to say I am up at like
[02:04:06.640 --> 02:04:07.720]  4 a.m. every day.
[02:04:07.720 --> 02:04:09.640]  So I got that going
[02:04:09.640 --> 02:04:10.480]  for me.
[02:04:10.480 --> 02:04:11.480]  But
[02:04:12.200 --> 02:04:13.200]  which is nice.
[02:04:14.360 --> 02:04:15.880]  So anyway, the
[02:04:16.400 --> 02:04:18.280]  the free folk, we thank
[02:04:18.280 --> 02:04:19.960]  you for coming down to this side of
[02:04:19.960 --> 02:04:21.640]  the wall and and
[02:04:22.120 --> 02:04:23.280]  by the way, for everyone watching
[02:04:23.280 --> 02:04:24.280]  like this is
[02:04:25.160 --> 02:04:27.200]  what I love. And you guys were
[02:04:27.200 --> 02:04:28.800]  kind of keeping an eye on the chat
[02:04:28.800 --> 02:04:30.320]  and some people will talk shit.
[02:04:30.320 --> 02:04:32.040]  And it's just like just let someone
[02:04:32.040 --> 02:04:34.120]  talk about what they're doing and
[02:04:35.160 --> 02:04:37.120]  appreciate that we all have
[02:04:37.120 --> 02:04:38.920]  different ways of doing things and
[02:04:38.960 --> 02:04:40.720]  take what you want from them or
[02:04:40.720 --> 02:04:42.000]  ask questions.
[02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:43.000]  And maybe you see
[02:04:43.920 --> 02:04:45.760]  someone say something that makes you
[02:04:46.040 --> 02:04:48.000]  dig deeper into a topic.
[02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:49.920]  And, you know, everyone
[02:04:49.920 --> 02:04:51.080]  has their own path.
[02:04:51.080 --> 02:04:53.000]  And, you know, that's
[02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:54.640]  why I wanted to stop for a second
[02:04:54.640 --> 02:04:56.080]  on the clone X, because because
[02:04:56.080 --> 02:04:57.360]  people were talking about it.
[02:04:57.360 --> 02:04:59.200]  And it's like, you know, it's
[02:04:59.200 --> 02:05:00.440]  it's to each their own.
[02:05:00.880 --> 02:05:02.840]  And if the audience
[02:05:02.840 --> 02:05:04.360]  if the audience knew how many of
[02:05:04.360 --> 02:05:05.520]  their regenerative heroes were
[02:05:05.520 --> 02:05:07.520]  using mycobutanol and avid
[02:05:07.600 --> 02:05:09.000]  and imidacloprid,
[02:05:09.400 --> 02:05:10.800]  they wouldn't hassle us about using
[02:05:10.800 --> 02:05:11.800]  clone X.
[02:05:11.840 --> 02:05:12.360]  So.
[02:05:12.360 --> 02:05:14.240]  Well, and the other thing
[02:05:14.240 --> 02:05:15.880]  you guys mentioned that I
[02:05:15.880 --> 02:05:17.720]  that I appreciated, that
[02:05:17.720 --> 02:05:19.280]  I wanted to actually just quickly
[02:05:19.280 --> 02:05:20.840]  touch on was, you know, you
[02:05:20.840 --> 02:05:22.520]  sometimes do use inputs
[02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:24.000]  and.
[02:05:24.520 --> 02:05:24.800]  Yeah.
[02:05:24.800 --> 02:05:25.400]  Always.
[02:05:25.400 --> 02:05:26.000]  Yeah.
[02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:27.440]  And we do.
[02:05:27.440 --> 02:05:28.440]  Yeah. And.
[02:05:29.880 --> 02:05:31.520]  You know, I depend on
[02:05:31.920 --> 02:05:33.680]  how mature your soil
[02:05:33.680 --> 02:05:34.680]  is, I would say.
[02:05:36.400 --> 02:05:38.200]  Yeah, well, I think I
[02:05:38.200 --> 02:05:39.360]  would do it without it.
[02:05:39.400 --> 02:05:40.840]  And then I have a lot of questions.
[02:05:41.400 --> 02:05:42.160]  Yeah.
[02:05:42.160 --> 02:05:43.760]  And you're not using anything.
[02:05:45.080 --> 02:05:46.080]  You know, they are.
[02:05:46.080 --> 02:05:47.520]  We've worked for you
[02:05:47.640 --> 02:05:49.520]  and everything we're doing.
[02:05:50.040 --> 02:05:51.440]  We know everything we're putting in.
[02:05:51.480 --> 02:05:53.400]  We know every the reason why we're
[02:05:53.400 --> 02:05:54.400]  doing it. And so,
[02:05:56.200 --> 02:05:57.640]  yeah, we wouldn't be doing it if it
[02:05:57.640 --> 02:05:59.560]  wasn't necessary for success.
[02:06:00.040 --> 02:06:01.000]  Yeah.
[02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:02.800]  If you don't use any inputs and you
[02:06:02.800 --> 02:06:04.520]  just try to water a soil
[02:06:04.600 --> 02:06:05.680]  and you try to do this thing that
[02:06:05.680 --> 02:06:07.640]  people talk about called water only,
[02:06:08.520 --> 02:06:09.800]  you know, that first harvest,
[02:06:09.800 --> 02:06:11.120]  depending on how well you mix the
[02:06:11.120 --> 02:06:12.640]  soil, might go well or it might go
[02:06:12.640 --> 02:06:13.560]  bad.
[02:06:13.560 --> 02:06:15.280]  If it goes well, usually the second
[02:06:15.280 --> 02:06:16.920]  and third starts to taper off.
[02:06:16.920 --> 02:06:18.440]  And usually by the fourth harvest is
[02:06:18.440 --> 02:06:19.720]  when they call us because it's all
[02:06:19.720 --> 02:06:20.720]  just going to hell.
[02:06:21.040 --> 02:06:22.440]  And once it gets to that fourth
[02:06:22.440 --> 02:06:23.800]  harvest, it takes one to two
[02:06:23.800 --> 02:06:25.360]  harvests in a good situation to
[02:06:25.360 --> 02:06:27.280]  bring it back to the results
[02:06:27.280 --> 02:06:28.800]  you had on harvest one.
[02:06:29.200 --> 02:06:31.200]  So if you try to get a soil and only
[02:06:31.200 --> 02:06:33.040]  add water of six
[02:06:33.040 --> 02:06:34.200]  harvests, you're going to have two
[02:06:34.200 --> 02:06:35.200]  decent ones.
[02:06:35.360 --> 02:06:36.360]  And that's fine if
[02:06:37.160 --> 02:06:38.960]  that works with your model of
[02:06:38.960 --> 02:06:40.880]  cultivation. But in the cultivation
[02:06:40.880 --> 02:06:42.480]  space in commercial
[02:06:43.040 --> 02:06:44.040]  situation.
[02:06:45.280 --> 02:06:47.480]  Yeah, you need to you need to
[02:06:47.720 --> 02:06:49.680]  behave in a way that allows
[02:06:50.160 --> 02:06:52.400]  consistent support of your plants
[02:06:52.560 --> 02:06:53.400]  year round.
[02:06:53.400 --> 02:06:55.160]  And, you know,
[02:06:55.160 --> 02:06:56.960]  the this water only thing's really
[02:06:56.960 --> 02:06:57.800]  gotten out of control.
[02:06:57.800 --> 02:06:59.640]  Like people aren't doing water only.
[02:06:59.640 --> 02:07:01.440]  I promise you, like they're not, you
[02:07:01.440 --> 02:07:02.440]  know, so.
[02:07:03.360 --> 02:07:05.040]  Yeah, I just I just commend free
[02:07:05.040 --> 02:07:06.840]  folk for being honest in that they're
[02:07:06.840 --> 02:07:07.920]  doing analysis.
[02:07:07.920 --> 02:07:09.240]  They're using nutrients.
[02:07:09.240 --> 02:07:11.080]  They're having a great outcome and
[02:07:11.080 --> 02:07:12.880]  it's enjoyable, you know, and that's
[02:07:12.880 --> 02:07:14.560]  for me, that's sustainability.
[02:07:15.160 --> 02:07:16.800]  If a farmer comes out and tries to
[02:07:16.880 --> 02:07:19.080]  copy what they think is real and
[02:07:19.080 --> 02:07:20.680]  fails, that's not sustainable
[02:07:21.160 --> 02:07:22.160]  at all, really.
[02:07:22.840 --> 02:07:24.960]  And I just I really commend free
[02:07:24.960 --> 02:07:27.400]  folk for just being authentic and
[02:07:27.760 --> 02:07:29.640]  really just boldly committing to the
[02:07:29.640 --> 02:07:31.240]  path that they feel is most
[02:07:31.240 --> 02:07:32.680]  appropriate to the context of their
[02:07:32.680 --> 02:07:33.680]  situation.
[02:07:34.040 --> 02:07:35.480]  You know, they've run the gamut.
[02:07:35.480 --> 02:07:36.400]  They've done it all.
[02:07:36.400 --> 02:07:37.400]  They've done all the can.
[02:07:37.680 --> 02:07:38.880]  They've done all the Internet's.
[02:07:38.880 --> 02:07:40.920]  They've done all the recipes like
[02:07:40.920 --> 02:07:42.840]  they've done all that by the time we
[02:07:42.840 --> 02:07:43.960]  even met them, you know.
[02:07:43.960 --> 02:07:45.840]  So we're making
[02:07:46.280 --> 02:07:47.280]  stuff.
[02:07:47.480 --> 02:07:48.960]  You know, and that's why we got this
[02:07:48.960 --> 02:07:50.680]  guy in there. He said, you know, we
[02:07:51.120 --> 02:07:52.680]  make enough stuff and we
[02:07:53.040 --> 02:07:54.480]  we really value all that.
[02:07:54.520 --> 02:07:55.880]  I mean, our journey
[02:07:56.560 --> 02:07:58.200]  is how we got to where we are.
[02:07:58.200 --> 02:07:59.800]  So we're not bashing anything.
[02:07:59.800 --> 02:08:01.480]  We're just saying like, this is how
[02:08:01.480 --> 02:08:03.320]  we're doing it and
[02:08:03.320 --> 02:08:04.600]  and it's working for us.
[02:08:04.600 --> 02:08:05.600]  And, you know, we
[02:08:06.640 --> 02:08:08.360]  know what's in our soil and we know
[02:08:08.360 --> 02:08:09.520]  why we're about to add some
[02:08:09.520 --> 02:08:10.520]  amendments to it.
[02:08:10.800 --> 02:08:12.720]  And we know why
[02:08:13.040 --> 02:08:14.920]  we need nutrients and
[02:08:15.720 --> 02:08:16.720]  and that's why
[02:08:17.600 --> 02:08:18.600]  we're doing it.
[02:08:18.840 --> 02:08:20.840]  But and I think another thing is
[02:08:20.840 --> 02:08:22.840]  that one of the reasons why
[02:08:22.840 --> 02:08:24.720]  we know that Scott and
[02:08:24.720 --> 02:08:26.680]  Sarah aren't full of shit is
[02:08:26.680 --> 02:08:27.680]  that Jacob was
[02:08:28.560 --> 02:08:30.440]  growing square foot gardening
[02:08:30.880 --> 02:08:32.920]  using only compost,
[02:08:33.160 --> 02:08:35.160]  peat and perlite for 10
[02:08:35.160 --> 02:08:36.940]  years. And he had the most
[02:08:36.960 --> 02:08:38.840]  impressive vegetables you've
[02:08:38.840 --> 02:08:39.840]  ever seen.
[02:08:39.920 --> 02:08:40.840]  Nice.
[02:08:40.840 --> 02:08:42.560]  And so we
[02:08:43.160 --> 02:08:45.760]  know we know that growing
[02:08:45.760 --> 02:08:47.680]  organically in a simple way
[02:08:47.680 --> 02:08:49.200]  like that can work.
[02:08:50.960 --> 02:08:53.240]  And if you want to quit guessing
[02:08:53.560 --> 02:08:55.280]  what you're doing, then you're
[02:08:55.280 --> 02:08:57.240]  going to search Crested Soil
[02:08:57.600 --> 02:08:59.360]  and you're going to call them and
[02:08:59.360 --> 02:09:01.440]  talk to them for an hour
[02:09:01.760 --> 02:09:03.600]  and say, these are the things
[02:09:03.600 --> 02:09:05.240]  I'm trying to accomplish and these
[02:09:05.240 --> 02:09:06.320]  are the things that I think are
[02:09:06.320 --> 02:09:07.320]  going to be awesome.
[02:09:07.840 --> 02:09:09.680]  And Scott will point you
[02:09:09.680 --> 02:09:12.080]  in the right direction because he's
[02:09:12.080 --> 02:09:13.080]  seeing everybody
[02:09:14.560 --> 02:09:16.520]  try all the things that you're
[02:09:16.520 --> 02:09:18.160]  going to ask him about.
[02:09:18.520 --> 02:09:20.360]  So we've tried
[02:09:20.480 --> 02:09:21.480]  JADAM, we've
[02:09:22.360 --> 02:09:24.360]  tried the K&F stuff, we've
[02:09:24.360 --> 02:09:25.360]  tried BioBiz, we've
[02:09:26.240 --> 02:09:28.400]  tried Roots Organic, we've tried
[02:09:29.160 --> 02:09:30.160]  Fox Farm.
[02:09:31.560 --> 02:09:33.160]  And then we went
[02:09:33.160 --> 02:09:35.160]  to we went and knew that, hey,
[02:09:35.160 --> 02:09:36.160]  we need
[02:09:37.120 --> 02:09:39.160]  a larger mass of soil and
[02:09:39.160 --> 02:09:41.560]  and we need that to be high quality
[02:09:41.560 --> 02:09:42.400]  soil.
[02:09:42.400 --> 02:09:44.320]  And whenever I started calling
[02:09:44.320 --> 02:09:46.520]  around asking people
[02:09:46.520 --> 02:09:48.640]  like, OK, send me at least
[02:09:48.640 --> 02:09:50.120]  your Logan Lab test of
[02:09:50.600 --> 02:09:52.360]  of your soil so we can compare
[02:09:52.360 --> 02:09:53.360]  it to the other stuff.
[02:09:53.560 --> 02:09:55.360]  And nobody would even send
[02:09:55.360 --> 02:09:57.680]  me the Logan Labs results
[02:09:57.680 --> 02:09:59.200]  for their soil, not not
[02:09:59.840 --> 02:10:01.640]  Roots Organic, not Fox Farm,
[02:10:01.640 --> 02:10:03.880]  not the local Living Soil people.
[02:10:04.600 --> 02:10:06.440]  And so then whenever you try to go
[02:10:06.440 --> 02:10:09.040]  and say, hey, show me your bioassay
[02:10:09.080 --> 02:10:11.080]  of your living soil, they're like,
[02:10:11.120 --> 02:10:12.640]  what what is that?
[02:10:13.280 --> 02:10:15.080]  And we're like, oh, you know, is
[02:10:15.080 --> 02:10:17.040]  there anything alive in your
[02:10:17.040 --> 02:10:17.920]  living soil?
[02:10:17.920 --> 02:10:19.480]  And they're like, oh, well,
[02:10:20.040 --> 02:10:21.440]  we'll get back to you on that.
[02:10:21.960 --> 02:10:23.360]  And so
[02:10:24.720 --> 02:10:26.680]  we really looked at everything.
[02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:28.960]  And the other one we were looking
[02:10:28.960 --> 02:10:30.720]  at was was Build-A-Soil.
[02:10:30.840 --> 02:10:32.840]  And so whenever we
[02:10:32.840 --> 02:10:34.760]  called Scott and Sarah, it was after
[02:10:34.760 --> 02:10:37.000]  watching a Future Cannabis episode
[02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:38.960]  and it was with Scott, Sarah and
[02:10:38.960 --> 02:10:41.040]  Eric. And they said if people
[02:10:41.040 --> 02:10:42.960]  would just call me before they
[02:10:42.960 --> 02:10:45.080]  had a problem, man, just think
[02:10:45.080 --> 02:10:46.200]  of the things that they could
[02:10:46.200 --> 02:10:47.200]  accomplish.
[02:10:47.760 --> 02:10:49.720]  And I said, OK, well, that's
[02:10:49.720 --> 02:10:50.680]  basically us.
[02:10:50.680 --> 02:10:52.560]  Like I'll call them.
[02:10:52.720 --> 02:10:54.600]  And if if I can
[02:10:54.800 --> 02:10:56.960]  prevent a problem, then
[02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:58.600]  I'm going to save us a lot of money
[02:10:58.600 --> 02:10:59.640]  and a lot of time.
[02:10:59.920 --> 02:11:01.920]  And really, we were.
[02:11:03.040 --> 02:11:05.160]  You know, making the
[02:11:05.160 --> 02:11:07.080]  the JADAM wetting agent and
[02:11:07.080 --> 02:11:09.440]  making the JADAM microbial
[02:11:09.480 --> 02:11:10.480]  solution.
[02:11:10.480 --> 02:11:11.920]  And we're about halfway through
[02:11:11.920 --> 02:11:13.680]  that whenever we called Scott
[02:11:13.880 --> 02:11:16.240]  and like luckily
[02:11:16.840 --> 02:11:19.240]  he had already gained that experience
[02:11:19.240 --> 02:11:20.800]  and saved us from that.
[02:11:21.160 --> 02:11:23.360]  And so if you want to find somebody
[02:11:23.360 --> 02:11:25.880]  that has experience trying
[02:11:25.920 --> 02:11:27.960]  everything and trying everything for
[02:11:27.960 --> 02:11:30.200]  several years and testing
[02:11:30.200 --> 02:11:32.480]  them at a scientific
[02:11:32.480 --> 02:11:34.640]  level, then then give
[02:11:34.640 --> 02:11:35.560]  Scott a call.
[02:11:35.560 --> 02:11:37.760]  And I can tell
[02:11:37.800 --> 02:11:40.080]  you that we've fact checked
[02:11:42.080 --> 02:11:43.960]  everything that they're saying and
[02:11:43.960 --> 02:11:45.720]  everything that they're saying lines
[02:11:45.720 --> 02:11:47.840]  up and is working
[02:11:47.840 --> 02:11:48.840]  for us.
[02:11:49.560 --> 02:11:51.280]  Yeah, I want to echo
[02:11:51.280 --> 02:11:53.000]  that, too, and just say that, you
[02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.400]  know, the value of the bioassay,
[02:11:55.400 --> 02:11:57.320]  which so so
[02:11:57.360 --> 02:11:59.360]  Sarah has been so kind
[02:11:59.360 --> 02:12:01.400]  to work with us and give
[02:12:01.400 --> 02:12:03.160]  us that tool.
[02:12:03.160 --> 02:12:05.120]  And we can't do that on our own
[02:12:05.120 --> 02:12:07.040]  yet. And we hope someday we'll be
[02:12:07.040 --> 02:12:08.000]  able to.
[02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:09.160]  But, you know, we
[02:12:10.040 --> 02:12:12.000]  she is reviewing our soil, looking
[02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:13.320]  what's in it. I'm looking at one
[02:12:13.320 --> 02:12:15.320]  right here. It's got, you know, how
[02:12:15.320 --> 02:12:17.240]  many of the flagellates,
[02:12:17.240 --> 02:12:18.960]  how much and how many amoeba are in
[02:12:18.960 --> 02:12:20.480]  there, you know, whether or not what
[02:12:20.480 --> 02:12:22.800]  our total fun guy is,
[02:12:22.800 --> 02:12:24.400]  you know, total bacteria.
[02:12:24.400 --> 02:12:26.480]  So our living soil is living
[02:12:26.480 --> 02:12:28.040]  because we know it's living.
[02:12:28.040 --> 02:12:30.240]  And who else can say that?
[02:12:30.240 --> 02:12:32.520]  And not very many people.
[02:12:32.520 --> 02:12:34.400]  And if we didn't know it was living,
[02:12:34.400 --> 02:12:36.280]  we wouldn't be saying that it was
[02:12:36.280 --> 02:12:38.200]  because and that's the thing is
[02:12:38.200 --> 02:12:40.560]  like it's living because
[02:12:40.560 --> 02:12:42.520]  we tested it and we know, you
[02:12:42.520 --> 02:12:43.520]  know.
[02:12:44.040 --> 02:12:45.880]  Yeah, yeah, those are those are
[02:12:45.880 --> 02:12:46.960]  really kind.
[02:12:46.960 --> 02:12:48.600]  Those are really super kind words.
[02:12:48.600 --> 02:12:50.320]  But I have to say, like all the
[02:12:50.320 --> 02:12:52.280]  research that you gentlemen do and
[02:12:52.280 --> 02:12:54.160]  just the way that you carry yourself
[02:12:54.160 --> 02:12:55.640]  and the accountability that you hold
[02:12:55.640 --> 02:12:57.400]  in your own lives, like
[02:12:57.400 --> 02:12:59.400]  it, like you really do fact check
[02:12:59.400 --> 02:13:00.680]  everything I send you.
[02:13:00.680 --> 02:13:02.760]  Like, I think I think that's awesome.
[02:13:02.760 --> 02:13:04.000]  You know, it holds me accountable.
[02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:05.280]  So I'm not blowing smoke up your
[02:13:05.280 --> 02:13:07.240]  butt, but, you
[02:13:07.240 --> 02:13:08.240]  know, to me.
[02:13:09.360 --> 02:13:11.360]  You know, I've Sarah
[02:13:11.360 --> 02:13:12.880]  and I have measured the decline of the
[02:13:12.880 --> 02:13:14.800]  planet, sustainability is extremely
[02:13:14.800 --> 02:13:15.520]  important to us.
[02:13:15.520 --> 02:13:17.840]  We've done agroforestry, we've done
[02:13:17.840 --> 02:13:19.600]  ecological restoration, we've worked
[02:13:19.600 --> 02:13:21.120]  with the Healthy Soils Initiative,
[02:13:21.120 --> 02:13:22.560]  we've worked on government grant
[02:13:22.560 --> 02:13:23.760]  projects.
[02:13:23.760 --> 02:13:25.360]  You know, we know we're very aware of
[02:13:25.360 --> 02:13:26.760]  the current state of the planet.
[02:13:26.760 --> 02:13:28.920]  And, you know, for us.
[02:13:30.200 --> 02:13:31.800]  I think the most important component
[02:13:31.800 --> 02:13:33.800]  of sustainability is authenticity
[02:13:33.800 --> 02:13:36.160]  and the this sector
[02:13:36.160 --> 02:13:38.000]  of cannabis has gotten kind of off
[02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.280]  track with well intentions.
[02:13:40.280 --> 02:13:41.600]  The one quote was kind of funny.
[02:13:41.600 --> 02:13:43.520]  I I'm trying to be careful not saying
[02:13:43.520 --> 02:13:44.840]  all your heroes are full of shit.
[02:13:44.840 --> 02:13:47.040]  But what we've created,
[02:13:47.040 --> 02:13:48.520]  what we've created within this
[02:13:48.520 --> 02:13:50.360]  community is,
[02:13:50.360 --> 02:13:52.400]  you know, we we took a natural move
[02:13:52.400 --> 02:13:54.880]  away from doing everything
[02:13:54.880 --> 02:13:56.600]  following Masanobu, which led to
[02:13:56.600 --> 02:13:58.680]  benefit, which we advocate.
[02:13:58.680 --> 02:14:00.640]  But then we also have to reel
[02:14:00.640 --> 02:14:02.680]  it back into functionality
[02:14:02.680 --> 02:14:04.280]  and realize that what we're doing
[02:14:04.280 --> 02:14:05.560]  isn't natural.
[02:14:05.560 --> 02:14:07.400]  It's not natural to produce four or
[02:14:07.400 --> 02:14:10.000]  five crops in a soil in a given year.
[02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:11.880]  That's not that's not natural.
[02:14:11.880 --> 02:14:13.280]  And so because we're doing this
[02:14:13.280 --> 02:14:15.120]  really unnatural thing,
[02:14:15.120 --> 02:14:16.920]  there are activities that
[02:14:16.920 --> 02:14:18.840]  the human has to do
[02:14:18.840 --> 02:14:21.480]  to maintain what Jacob defined
[02:14:21.480 --> 02:14:23.600]  perfectly as the machine.
[02:14:23.600 --> 02:14:26.440]  We have to keep this machine moving
[02:14:26.440 --> 02:14:27.960]  in order to stay in business.
[02:14:27.960 --> 02:14:29.800]  And, you know, my personal strategy
[02:14:29.800 --> 02:14:31.400]  for that is doing very calculated
[02:14:31.480 --> 02:14:33.560]  nutrition so we don't put a demand
[02:14:33.560 --> 02:14:34.880]  on soil chemistry.
[02:14:34.880 --> 02:14:36.720]  So soil chemistry never gets way out
[02:14:36.720 --> 02:14:38.680]  of whack. And then we're constantly
[02:14:38.680 --> 02:14:40.880]  correcting and adjusting and refining
[02:14:40.880 --> 02:14:42.840]  and maintaining that soil
[02:14:42.840 --> 02:14:44.440]  chemistry.
[02:14:44.440 --> 02:14:46.400]  And when we do that, the business
[02:14:46.400 --> 02:14:48.640]  is very sustainable and
[02:14:48.640 --> 02:14:51.000]  we're not using fungicides,
[02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:51.760]  literally none.
[02:14:51.760 --> 02:14:53.520]  These gentlemen have zero mold in
[02:14:53.520 --> 02:14:54.960]  their facility and will continue to
[02:14:54.960 --> 02:14:56.720]  not have mold in their facility.
[02:14:56.720 --> 02:14:58.760]  They don't even need an IPM strategy
[02:14:58.760 --> 02:15:01.360]  for it. They're using mathematical
[02:15:02.080 --> 02:15:04.160]  decision making skills to move
[02:15:04.160 --> 02:15:05.720]  them away from powdery mildew.
[02:15:05.720 --> 02:15:08.320]  That's very sustainable.
[02:15:08.320 --> 02:15:10.160]  You know, not ever having a fear of
[02:15:10.160 --> 02:15:11.000]  crop loss.
[02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:12.880]  That's extremely sustainable,
[02:15:12.880 --> 02:15:14.920]  you know, by taking some data points
[02:15:14.920 --> 02:15:17.280]  and calculating your position
[02:15:17.280 --> 02:15:19.400]  in that facility allows
[02:15:19.400 --> 02:15:20.880]  you to be sustainable.
[02:15:20.880 --> 02:15:23.040]  And and all that is in tandem
[02:15:23.040 --> 02:15:23.800]  with the microbes.
[02:15:23.800 --> 02:15:25.160]  I mean, the microbes are the ultimate
[02:15:25.160 --> 02:15:25.960]  benchmark.
[02:15:25.960 --> 02:15:27.120]  They they don't lie.
[02:15:27.120 --> 02:15:29.320]  So that's what I love about
[02:15:29.320 --> 02:15:31.560]  working with microbes and quantifying
[02:15:31.560 --> 02:15:33.040]  the living component of it is it just
[02:15:33.040 --> 02:15:34.160]  tells you the story and you don't have
[02:15:34.160 --> 02:15:35.280]  to think about it and you can just
[02:15:35.280 --> 02:15:36.200]  adjust accordingly.
[02:15:36.200 --> 02:15:38.520]  And, you know, it's
[02:15:38.520 --> 02:15:40.960]  it's a lovely way to recalibrate
[02:15:40.960 --> 02:15:43.600]  the gardener intuition
[02:15:43.600 --> 02:15:45.680]  when you're trying to, you know, get
[02:15:45.680 --> 02:15:47.400]  these microbes up and going and
[02:15:47.400 --> 02:15:48.720]  especially the beneficial fungi,
[02:15:48.720 --> 02:15:50.640]  because we all know,
[02:15:50.640 --> 02:15:52.600]  I guess maybe not all of us, but many
[02:15:52.600 --> 02:15:54.880]  of us know what what benefits
[02:15:54.880 --> 02:15:56.640]  can come from working with these
[02:15:56.640 --> 02:15:58.920]  microbes. And so when we quantify
[02:15:58.920 --> 02:16:00.880]  that, we know where we are and where
[02:16:00.880 --> 02:16:02.600]  we should be and if we're there.
[02:16:02.600 --> 02:16:03.600]  So.
[02:16:04.480 --> 02:16:06.640]  And Scott, just to put you on, just
[02:16:06.640 --> 02:16:08.920]  to put you guys on the spot,
[02:16:08.920 --> 02:16:10.680]  we need to pull out the microscope
[02:16:10.680 --> 02:16:12.440]  the next time.
[02:16:12.440 --> 02:16:13.520]  All right.
[02:16:13.520 --> 02:16:15.600]  Well, doing the microscope is so
[02:16:15.600 --> 02:16:17.320]  difficult because it can lead to the
[02:16:17.320 --> 02:16:19.400]  most boring television possible.
[02:16:19.400 --> 02:16:20.920]  Like we I think we'll have to do
[02:16:20.920 --> 02:16:21.800]  what we didn't know.
[02:16:21.800 --> 02:16:23.840]  Do some pre-recorded and
[02:16:23.840 --> 02:16:25.360]  then we can show them while you're
[02:16:25.360 --> 02:16:27.400]  like looking around the slide for
[02:16:27.400 --> 02:16:28.920]  something interesting so people
[02:16:28.920 --> 02:16:30.400]  don't have to sit there watching for
[02:16:30.400 --> 02:16:31.960]  10 minutes.
[02:16:31.960 --> 02:16:33.800]  Yeah, well, we'll do it and we'll
[02:16:33.800 --> 02:16:35.360]  get the cursor ready so we can draw.
[02:16:35.360 --> 02:16:37.400]  But and then sometimes you lose
[02:16:37.400 --> 02:16:39.400]  some of it. So like through
[02:16:39.400 --> 02:16:41.440]  the camera, through the TV, like now
[02:16:41.440 --> 02:16:42.920]  you can't really decipher what we're
[02:16:42.920 --> 02:16:44.160]  talking about.
[02:16:44.160 --> 02:16:45.760]  So some of it's kind of difficulty.
[02:16:45.760 --> 02:16:46.720]  But yeah, for sure.
[02:16:46.720 --> 02:16:47.760]  Yeah, totally.
[02:16:47.760 --> 02:16:48.960]  We got microscopes all over the
[02:16:48.960 --> 02:16:49.960]  place. We can plug them in.
[02:16:52.520 --> 02:16:55.440]  All right. Well, with that,
[02:16:55.440 --> 02:16:56.520]  thank you guys.
[02:16:56.920 --> 02:16:58.880]  I the beards are
[02:16:58.880 --> 02:17:00.360]  epic and I'm very jealous.
[02:17:01.600 --> 02:17:02.600]  I know.
[02:17:03.480 --> 02:17:04.920]  Jump mine up a little bit.
[02:17:04.920 --> 02:17:05.920]  Thank you, gentlemen.
[02:17:07.680 --> 02:17:10.040]  Everybody enjoy the rest
[02:17:10.040 --> 02:17:12.400]  of your Tuesday wherever you are.
[02:17:12.400 --> 02:17:14.760]  And I'll be back possibly
[02:17:14.760 --> 02:17:16.840]  tonight if I can stay awake with some
[02:17:16.840 --> 02:17:18.680]  people. And Alex Hardy, I see you.
[02:17:18.680 --> 02:17:19.800]  Elke, I see you.
[02:17:19.800 --> 02:17:21.720]  I want you guys on to
[02:17:21.720 --> 02:17:23.680]  and a bunch of other people who are
[02:17:23.680 --> 02:17:24.880]  lurking in the chat.
[02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:26.560]  So if tonight I can stay
[02:17:26.560 --> 02:17:28.480]  up past eight thirty,
[02:17:28.480 --> 02:17:30.680]  I may do something with two
[02:17:30.680 --> 02:17:32.880]  people on the breeding front.
[02:17:33.760 --> 02:17:36.680]  Otherwise, tomorrow at the
[02:17:36.680 --> 02:17:38.160]  bright and early hour of eight a.m.
[02:17:38.160 --> 02:17:40.240]  So with that, I will
[02:17:40.240 --> 02:17:42.240]  kill the live transmission.
