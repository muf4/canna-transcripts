[00:00.000 --> 00:16.140]  I don't know Asia Moon but you know I think that song isn't quite my fitting
[00:16.140 --> 00:21.660]  for an Alberta country boy but well I'll take it anyway.
[00:21.660 --> 00:28.860]  Everybody this is the lovely Mae Moon who I know is Asia myself because that's
[00:28.860 --> 00:33.860]  how John Burfeller your fellow introduced us she is a wonderful
[00:33.860 --> 00:41.060]  wonderful lady and she's putting on the Mums Cup. Asia you've been doing this for
[00:41.060 --> 00:46.260]  several years you took a break through COVID and you know five kids of course
[00:46.260 --> 00:53.180]  but it's back tell us a little bit more about it. Okay so the Mums Cup is the
[00:53.180 --> 01:00.980]  mail-order marijuana cup it started in 2017 strangely enough I was under a
[01:00.980 --> 01:06.740]  whole bunch of court cases and we're just kind of sad because we normally we
[01:06.740 --> 01:10.940]  would go places go to cups and do things and one of my employees said to me at
[01:10.940 --> 01:13.660]  the time he's like well why don't we just bring everyone to you since you
[01:13.660 --> 01:17.900]  can't go to them and that's how the Mom Cup was born and then also with so many
[01:17.900 --> 01:21.700]  friends not able to necessarily come to us it gave us the opportunity to send
[01:21.700 --> 01:26.020]  them a kit interact with them online and it used to be for my birthday and
[01:26.020 --> 01:30.380]  now we've changed it up a little bit for this year we've been away for four years
[01:30.380 --> 01:38.100]  not just two and we're gonna be in Hope BC with a three-day campout for everyone
[01:38.100 --> 01:44.980]  to enjoy by the Othello River there. Okay so before we get into kind of like the
[01:45.220 --> 01:51.700]  Mom Cup here you're a passionate long-term advocate in the space you sent
[01:51.700 --> 01:56.620]  me of your photo in that magazine I'm like I fucking know her I've seen her in
[01:56.620 --> 02:01.060]  the Vancouver area before I've been so you know myself I've been born and
[02:01.060 --> 02:04.500]  raised in Vancouver I was a passionate chef I was actually the executive chef
[02:04.500 --> 02:07.860]  of black and blue in downtown Vancouver for a number of years big huge
[02:07.860 --> 02:12.860]  restaurant steakhouse but I've always like had one kind of foot kind of in the
[02:13.620 --> 02:19.260]  observation area of the cannabis space because of where I am and my passion for
[02:19.260 --> 02:23.900]  the herb since a very young age so I would love to know a little bit about
[02:23.900 --> 02:28.340]  your advocacy your history and and kind of a little bit about you just set a
[02:28.340 --> 02:31.500]  preface of so people kind of know who you are and because we have a lot of
[02:31.500 --> 02:35.540]  California and international based audience that might not be familiar with
[02:35.540 --> 02:40.940]  you like I have seen you in magazines and seen you in part of the
[02:40.940 --> 02:45.340]  watching from the United States that's actually where I kind of started funny
[02:45.340 --> 02:50.300]  enough so instead of coming out in the cannabis community I came out in the
[02:50.300 --> 02:54.500]  skeptics community one of my first appearances was on the skeptics guide to
[02:54.500 --> 03:00.540]  the universe I flew out with my team from Vancouver to Las Vegas strangely
[03:00.540 --> 03:05.940]  enough and we did their show we also appeared on their online show from there
[03:05.940 --> 03:10.900]  we went back the following year to do their show one more time which was super
[03:10.900 --> 03:15.860]  fun I believe I did their show from Fiji and then I regrouped with them in
[03:15.860 --> 03:23.180]  Australia yeah so I started off in the US a lot of our original happy cats are
[03:23.180 --> 03:29.420]  all out of the United States I will say they were just you know bong pipe paper
[03:29.420 --> 03:34.220]  and shirt sales when we first started when I opened up our dispensary was for
[03:34.220 --> 03:39.820]  a Canadian group only but yes we originated kind of coming out in the US
[03:39.820 --> 03:45.780]  and then we went to Australia and we went to Mardi Gras before we even did
[03:45.780 --> 03:50.260]  anything local so we've kind of spread out all over the world we've done Fiji
[03:50.260 --> 03:54.820]  we've done New Zealand we've done Korea we've done Indonesia we've done Costa
[03:54.820 --> 03:58.500]  Rica I could probably go on I think there was 21 different countries we
[03:58.500 --> 04:04.620]  visited as the 12 high chicks and three happy cats over a few hundred years so
[04:04.620 --> 04:08.420]  we explored cannabis laws all over the place some places we couldn't even
[04:08.420 --> 04:13.060]  explore cannabis laws because it was so illegal that the threat of say death
[04:13.060 --> 04:18.460]  penalty or life in prison just for asking for it just wasn't worthy yeah
[04:18.460 --> 04:24.420]  so I've been printed in the United States in Australia in New Zealand in
[04:24.420 --> 04:29.500]  Amsterdam and in Canada in multiple different magazines and newspapers all
[04:29.500 --> 04:35.900]  for cannabis advocacy yeah I will say though we first started out when we
[04:35.900 --> 04:40.620]  chose some like scientific stuff versus cannabis based items but after our first
[04:40.620 --> 04:46.140]  two shows we decided okay time to come out of the the closet and then just you
[04:46.140 --> 04:50.000]  know let everyone know that we're pro cannabis and just go from there but yeah
[04:50.000 --> 04:57.460]  that started 2012 going out and speaking to the public it's been a fun go that's
[04:57.460 --> 05:02.900]  for sure I really enjoyed my time also at Seattle's hemp fest I got to be
[05:02.900 --> 05:08.460]  present there for multiple years as well as a speaker back in 2015 like I
[05:08.460 --> 05:11.380]  said we did Mardi Gras which is all the way in Australia we've also done the
[05:11.380 --> 05:18.020]  hemp Expo so one is at the top of the country or I guess more in the middle in
[05:18.020 --> 05:23.980]  Nimbin at the bottom so we did both Sydney and Nimbin over the years it's
[05:23.980 --> 05:28.700]  it's been really interesting and also seeing how like something as simple as a
[05:28.700 --> 05:34.060]  small change in the language on a law can mean so much more or so much less
[05:34.060 --> 05:38.300]  for another country Australia's just kind of getting through the first rounds
[05:38.300 --> 05:42.180]  of legalization for those that are medical users and yeah some of the
[05:42.180 --> 05:46.980]  wording is just a little bit different and it definitely changes how how much
[05:46.980 --> 05:52.460]  rights they have or don't have and yeah it's just I don't know we kind of stepped
[05:52.460 --> 05:57.500]  into the marijuana business or into cannabis industry on the basis that I'm
[05:57.500 --> 06:01.500]  disabled and it was kind of also fun to see people all over the world also
[06:01.500 --> 06:07.300]  disabled working full-time getting out there and doing similar stuff so yeah
[06:07.300 --> 06:12.140]  it's just I don't know my journey's just more been meeting people and having fun
[06:12.140 --> 06:17.780]  and helping others and it took a like I said a four-year break which has been
[06:17.780 --> 06:22.660]  wild I had another baby and that took a lot of work to have another baby and
[06:22.660 --> 06:26.180]  then Cove it hit like almost right around the same time so it was like a
[06:26.180 --> 06:30.500]  double kind of I don't know the right word is but yeah definitely had to lay
[06:30.500 --> 06:34.140]  low for a while there between the baby and Cove it back to back but it's it's
[06:34.140 --> 06:39.220]  cool to be back into entertainment I haven't actually been protesting though
[06:39.220 --> 06:43.340]  I definitely see a lot of things in the cannabis laws that I didn't like which
[06:43.340 --> 06:48.820]  is how I kind of got pushed into the political parts of the world that I've
[06:48.820 --> 06:53.580]  been in I actually worked for the NDP on a provincial and a federal level as a
[06:53.700 --> 06:57.420]  paid employee for two years and helped push forward some of the the changes
[06:57.420 --> 07:01.740]  that you see now mind you it will it takes a huge team no one person is
[07:01.740 --> 07:06.260]  responsible certainly my small little contribution definitely was needed
[07:06.260 --> 07:11.140]  though that's for sure I actually just rejoined politics back in June and I
[07:11.140 --> 07:16.460]  went to the most recent NDP convention and was able to kind of put my roots
[07:16.460 --> 07:21.740]  back out into the political and protesting world I kind of feel that
[07:21.740 --> 07:25.780]  protesting and politics kind of go hand in hand because you need someone to tell
[07:25.780 --> 07:29.660]  you what's wrong and what's unjust and then you need people like myself to
[07:29.660 --> 07:34.340]  create a team or create a team to be able to make those changes of injust or
[07:34.340 --> 07:38.940]  things that are wrong so I kind of yeah I don't know I just kind of crawled out
[07:38.940 --> 07:41.900]  of my closet this year and I said I'm ready here we go
[07:41.900 --> 07:47.220]  well you've recovered after having the last baby you got a little bit of time
[07:47.220 --> 07:52.700]  off you know you readjust your mental attitude on everything you know
[07:52.700 --> 07:56.820]  especially with five children and you know the oldest one is in their teens
[07:56.820 --> 08:02.220]  and that takes a lot of pressure too because we all know how teenagers are I
[08:02.220 --> 08:07.780]  know I had to apologize to my parents like me you know when your parents say I
[08:07.780 --> 08:12.540]  hope you have one just like yourself I I aced that one I definitely understood
[08:12.540 --> 08:16.820]  the assignment so you know I know you're smoking something that's very
[08:16.820 --> 08:22.060]  special because you're smoking it before we came live tell us about what you're
[08:22.060 --> 08:25.060]  smoking there young lady because I think that's somebody that's supporting the
[08:25.060 --> 08:30.220]  mom's cup as well so this is actually two entries mushed together from the mom
[08:30.220 --> 08:37.220]  cup it is some diamonds from dog dabs as well as some Congo from cheap cush they're
[08:37.220 --> 08:42.340]  a really fun local company at least to the lower mainland that does inexpensive
[08:42.340 --> 08:47.820]  deliveries and mail order but yeah this is getting me very very stoned because
[08:47.820 --> 08:52.140]  I don't normally have diamonds let alone this many diamonds and they put a little
[08:52.140 --> 08:59.180]  pack some of the people that were participating and I got like this huge
[08:59.180 --> 09:04.580]  container from dog dabs of diamonds I have actually never seen a container
[09:04.580 --> 09:08.660]  that big in my life so I was just like wow and they're like and that is for you
[09:08.660 --> 09:13.100]  so oh yeah needless to say I've been having a hard time getting out of my
[09:13.100 --> 09:16.700]  chair but given we're packing so many judges kits maybe that's for the best
[09:16.700 --> 09:22.460]  because we've had multiple samples come in the door we have and here's something
[09:22.460 --> 09:27.780]  funny normally where the mail order or the marijuana mail order cup and
[09:27.780 --> 09:32.380]  normally we have lots of marijuana but we only have one category for marijuana
[09:32.380 --> 09:38.460]  this year and we have three for extracts and one for edibles so the kits look a
[09:38.460 --> 09:42.780]  little different this year they're really pretty I've never seen so many
[09:42.780 --> 09:47.780]  diamonds in my life let alone like three separate entries yeah really pretty
[09:47.780 --> 09:52.460]  diamonds as well I'm very proud of all the medicine you guys have been making
[09:52.460 --> 09:58.140]  by the way for all the entries they are gorgeous looking extracts I I've been
[09:58.140 --> 10:02.280]  everywhere as I've said so to say that they look really good is definitely a
[10:02.280 --> 10:08.920]  compliment okay now before we go too much further let's say somebody wants to
[10:08.920 --> 10:14.480]  be there and have the judges pack they go to the happy cats presents the mom's
[10:14.480 --> 10:22.120]  cup or do they go to the mom cup 2022 at gmail.com you can either go to our
[10:22.120 --> 10:27.000]  Facebook web page which I believe is listed somewhere here or you can email
[10:27.200 --> 10:33.080]  me directly at mom cup 2022 at gmail.com or if you're old-fashioned like myself
[10:33.080 --> 10:40.560]  and just want a simple phone call you can call it 604-838-6384 and if for some
[10:40.560 --> 10:45.520]  reason you're not sure you can also buy your tickets right at the door obviously
[10:45.520 --> 10:49.400]  you're gonna have to shoot us an email if you want the address we're just not
[10:49.400 --> 10:52.600]  posting the address because you know we're having a big party in the middle
[10:52.600 --> 10:57.160]  of nowhere but yeah feel free to share it amongst yourselves we just don't want
[10:57.160 --> 11:02.720]  to post the address necessarily it is $35 just to come for Saturday to see Mike
[11:02.720 --> 11:07.120]  Rita it is $50 for the entire weekend so if you want to be there Friday Saturday
[11:07.120 --> 11:12.840]  and Sunday it's $50 and if you want to do the camp out and stay it's $100 for
[11:12.840 --> 11:17.280]  the camp out and stay and if you want a judges kit it's $150 and that gets you
[11:17.280 --> 11:20.240]  in the door and all that jazz as well so it's just a little bit more than you get
[11:20.240 --> 11:23.880]  a big bag of weed and get to kind of see what everybody's brought in for the
[11:23.880 --> 11:29.200]  competition and for a hundred and fifty bucks give my friends I mean you can't
[11:29.200 --> 11:32.960]  get much better like look at the look on this young lady's face for what she is
[11:32.960 --> 11:38.880]  smoking right now I mean that's a judges pack that I think I would like to have
[11:38.880 --> 11:43.720]  but I don't smoke that much but I think I think London is was talking something
[11:43.720 --> 11:49.520]  about he was gonna pick one up after the unicorn cup and do live judging just
[11:49.520 --> 11:54.600]  like he's been doing with the unicorn cup for the month and broadcast it
[11:54.600 --> 12:01.160]  every day and anybody that's got the judges back they can actually call let
[12:01.160 --> 12:05.640]  us know and they can come on live with us and do the judging at the same time
[12:05.640 --> 12:13.680]  even before I have any recommendation do not have the bets edibles the cookies or
[12:13.680 --> 12:19.080]  the Mad Hatter shatter edibles before you start judging because otherwise
[12:19.080 --> 12:24.240]  you're going to sleep or in my case slurring your words because you're so
[12:24.240 --> 12:30.280]  stoned from the edibles I will say that the bet definitely warned me that they
[12:30.280 --> 12:35.160]  were very very potent I said whatever I've got this I ate the whole cookie and
[12:35.160 --> 12:41.880]  I was like regrets because I was supposed to be working instead I put on
[12:41.880 --> 12:45.080]  a movie and I relaxed and I decided there'll be no more edibles well I'm
[12:45.080 --> 12:51.680]  trying to do numbers and judges yeah she made me four extra cookies and we got
[12:51.680 --> 12:56.400]  into them and it was a very very strong absolutely what we need for a judges
[12:56.400 --> 12:59.840]  kit that's for sure but guys if you're hoping to get through the day probably
[12:59.840 --> 13:03.760]  best to save those edibles for evening or after your shows or whatever your
[13:03.760 --> 13:11.480]  plans are so can we now this is something now we aren't doing with the
[13:11.640 --> 13:16.760]  unicorn cup but you're clearly doing an edibles category and this has been
[13:16.760 --> 13:20.640]  interesting to me so as a chef edibles are a pretty easy thing like how
[13:20.640 --> 13:26.120]  something tastes it's pretty easy for me to comprehend and how to how to execute
[13:26.120 --> 13:30.000]  that presentation blah blah blah that's easy but how do you how do you go about
[13:30.000 --> 13:35.600]  judging the impact of the high I eat edibles on a pretty regular basis I'm
[13:35.600 --> 13:40.000]  not like a huge edible consumer but how do you incorporate that into the whole
[13:40.000 --> 13:44.480]  image of everything like how would you when you sit down and practically judge
[13:44.480 --> 13:49.200]  an edible can you walk me through your personal process normally when someone
[13:49.200 --> 13:55.400]  does like an edibles portion of a cup they would do one per day where some
[13:55.400 --> 13:58.040]  people like to have their edibles in the morning some people like to have in the
[13:58.040 --> 14:01.720]  afternoon some people are hardcore like me where they eat them all day like it's
[14:01.720 --> 14:06.400]  a joke but normally when you're doing like an actual serious judging you'd
[14:06.400 --> 14:10.640]  want to space it out so I mean if you eat all the edibles at once at that
[14:10.640 --> 14:14.640]  point you can only really judge the taste I mean I'm certainly not going to
[14:14.640 --> 14:19.400]  tell someone how to judge but my recommendation would be to try one say
[14:19.400 --> 14:23.720]  you know a couple hours before bed and then the next day try the next one and
[14:23.720 --> 14:27.840]  continue so until all the edibles are gone out of your kit I have seen people
[14:27.840 --> 14:33.040]  where they literally shove them all in their mouth all at once and decide on
[14:33.040 --> 14:38.400]  which has the best flavor and that's kind of what they go with I've seen all
[14:38.400 --> 14:42.920]  sorts of weird ways to judge where people literally judge it based on what
[14:42.920 --> 14:47.120]  it looks like before they even taste it and some of them don't even make it past
[14:47.120 --> 14:52.560]  the look test when it comes to edibles like I said I'm not gonna tell you how
[14:52.560 --> 14:58.200]  to judge but you know it's it's your kit have fun and hopefully you you figure
[14:58.200 --> 15:01.520]  out what you think is the best because really it's not what your friend thinks
[15:01.520 --> 15:07.400]  is the best or anything like that it is your vote your choice and if you vote
[15:07.400 --> 15:14.920]  for the the jelly or the gummies as opposed to the cookies on the basis that
[15:14.920 --> 15:18.720]  you just happen to like gummies better I mean that's the whole point right we
[15:18.720 --> 15:25.080]  want to hear your opinion you know if you don't want to say smoke the the
[15:25.080 --> 15:29.200]  indica because you're a sativa person then I guess you're you're not voting
[15:29.200 --> 15:33.320]  for that right and some people vote for all sorts of reasons and you know
[15:33.320 --> 15:37.480]  someone who's been in politics I've seen people do strategic voting they vote
[15:37.480 --> 15:42.200]  someone else out some people vote for the sake of they like that person they
[15:42.200 --> 15:46.680]  want them to be their leaders so I mean that's what's great about democracy you
[15:46.680 --> 15:49.840]  don't really have a reason why you're voting a certain way you can just do it
[15:49.840 --> 15:54.560]  I do like that appearance level because when you look at it at a consumer level
[15:54.560 --> 15:57.960]  like when you're when you win because practically I mean a lot of these people
[15:57.960 --> 16:01.360]  are probably just doing this for their passion but some people are probably
[16:01.360 --> 16:05.240]  doing it for their business right and and and practically when you're thinking
[16:05.240 --> 16:08.760]  about it and doing this type of thing like what's what's gonna happen as a
[16:08.760 --> 16:12.920]  customer or a person that's that that that goes into a shop and sees a product
[16:12.920 --> 16:16.080]  they're gonna look at it as a bag they're gonna look at his bag appeal as
[16:16.080 --> 16:19.840]  we would for flour or as the presentation for a food product now food
[16:19.840 --> 16:24.880]  products interesting and a little bit different to really that strong win on
[16:24.880 --> 16:28.320]  the basis the packaging was really pretty sometimes people like the way
[16:28.320 --> 16:32.360]  something looks there's nothing to do with what's inside it's just as much a
[16:32.360 --> 16:36.160]  part of the experience is consumption right our entries right here at the
[16:36.160 --> 16:46.640]  front door now when I pop this open guys it smells like skunk totally smells like
[16:46.640 --> 16:54.920]  like that pneumonia II like ammonia ammonia kind of skunkiness or or like
[16:54.920 --> 17:07.400]  that putrid ease other side of it more the peach yeah the garbage rot it's more
[17:07.400 --> 17:12.040]  like your dog got sprayed by the skunk and you got to get out the tomato juice
[17:12.040 --> 17:19.880]  to clean him off is it pre or post tomato juice lathering all right let's
[17:19.880 --> 17:24.120]  see what's in this box this is the last box we've been waiting for which is the
[17:24.120 --> 17:36.560]  dry so again as we've noticed I don't know if you mentioned it to all the all
[17:36.560 --> 17:41.520]  the links and everything and how to contact them to get tickets if you're in
[17:41.520 --> 17:46.080]  if you're in the area it's happening in Hope BC Canada what's it like an hour
[17:46.080 --> 17:50.840]  and a half outside our and you're not able to attend the judges kits are also
[17:50.840 --> 17:54.280]  sent by mail so you just need to give us an address and proof that you're 19 or
[17:54.280 --> 18:00.480]  older and anyone can watch the show for free at our three happy cats patient so
[18:00.480 --> 18:04.160]  if you maybe you just can't afford it or you're not in the area feel free to tune
[18:04.160 --> 18:07.960]  in it is like I said free to join there's also going to be contests over
[18:07.960 --> 18:12.120]  the weekend for online viewers so you know maybe you want to win a shirt you
[18:12.120 --> 18:15.680]  want to win a bong or you want to participate in voting for our best
[18:15.680 --> 18:20.400]  musician anyone in the audience is allowed to help vote for our best
[18:20.400 --> 18:25.360]  musicians on Friday and Saturday night yeah that's on your happy cats channel
[18:25.360 --> 18:29.080]  and we're also going to be hopefully live streaming it on the future cannabis
[18:29.080 --> 18:35.200]  project at the same time as well so why bodies but bodies popped in here and
[18:35.200 --> 18:38.440]  asked what is the judges kit come in and and we've taught we've asked you
[18:38.440 --> 18:43.560]  this before but the judges kits actually go out for national which is today so
[18:43.560 --> 18:49.160]  that's anybody that is past Manitoba tomorrow anything that is a regional
[18:49.160 --> 18:53.600]  will be going out we have one more week for everyone to buy judges kits that are
[18:53.600 --> 18:57.520]  online after that there's not enough time to get it to you via the mail which
[18:57.520 --> 19:02.520]  is unfortunate but that's just the way it goes and for in person you can pick
[19:02.520 --> 19:07.640]  them up all the way to the Saturday of the event which is the 27th of August
[19:07.640 --> 19:12.440]  everyone will be given a code and that code allows you to vote online and
[19:12.440 --> 19:17.880]  there's an email address and everything to show you how to vote and we'll be
[19:17.880 --> 19:24.400]  announcing the winner on the Sunday with the mom cup awards that's just edit the
[19:24.400 --> 19:29.320]  background honey spring me coffee thank you love it love it I wish I got coffee
[19:29.320 --> 19:36.040]  delivered to me I was dealing with two screaming children so I don't give a
[19:36.040 --> 19:41.360]  fuck she's all wonderful I'm just smiling right now because our entry also
[19:41.360 --> 19:47.200]  came with shirts oh nice and they're really pretty we're actually doing a big
[19:47.200 --> 19:53.520]  auction for the harvest project and a lot of our sponsors have put in extra
[19:53.520 --> 19:58.480]  shirts and extra products so that we can auction them off with red beard who's
[19:58.480 --> 20:03.240]  Patrick Rolick he's done all of our celebrity auction since we just started
[20:03.240 --> 20:07.680]  doing the mom cup so I'm pretty happy that he's returning to help us Wow look
[20:07.680 --> 20:12.640]  at all this stuff this is amazing red beard so one thing that that did pop in
[20:12.640 --> 20:18.360]  is wah buddy popped in and said judges kids are just number label like so what
[20:18.360 --> 20:24.480]  you said so the food packaging it comes with the packaging of course with the
[20:24.480 --> 20:29.400]  with the other products like the roses and the flowers and so on and so forth
[20:29.400 --> 20:35.560]  what is the what does it come in does it come in a labeled package with packaging
[20:35.560 --> 20:41.800]  or number the company labeled it for us or if we did it for them it will other
[20:41.800 --> 20:48.520]  come in a flat pack or in this case these have come in aluminum containers
[20:48.520 --> 20:52.240]  there'll be a number on top and your voting card just like in the years past
[20:52.240 --> 20:56.920]  you can either use the voting card manually or you can use our online
[20:56.920 --> 21:02.280]  version it's totally up to you if you were on our online version of it though
[21:02.280 --> 21:07.440]  as opposed to coming in person you can use the digital or the physical one but
[21:07.440 --> 21:12.200]  you have to send us a picture of your digital of it digitally with your code
[21:12.200 --> 21:16.680]  if you can't do it the other way we don't care how you vote but once you use
[21:16.680 --> 21:21.880]  your one code that's it your code is no longer valid and it's in the system but
[21:21.880 --> 21:25.360]  yeah there'll be numbers on each of them and you just choose what you feel
[21:25.360 --> 21:31.120]  is the best for you and yeah it's pretty easy either send us the email or you go
[21:31.120 --> 21:35.320]  in on online or if you're coming in person we have ballot boxes or you can
[21:35.320 --> 21:41.120]  do it from your phone obviously if you're there in person as well you know
[21:41.120 --> 21:45.320]  and and so so some of it might have branding on it so people could recognize
[21:45.320 --> 21:49.920]  who it is a little right so they've had the option to other blind vote or
[21:49.920 --> 21:56.480]  regular vote so some of them have put their packaging on it they want you to
[21:56.480 --> 21:59.560]  know who they are some people don't want you to know and some of them have
[21:59.560 --> 22:04.360]  actually gone as far as repackaging it into completely different packaging so
[22:04.360 --> 22:08.440]  you wouldn't recognize who they are or necessarily where it's coming from I
[22:08.440 --> 22:11.720]  mean I know who they are when you vote them in the system the system obviously
[22:11.720 --> 22:15.040]  knows who they are but we've got some very interesting different versions of
[22:15.040 --> 22:21.200]  packaging like I said we have aluminum we have glass we have plastic we have
[22:21.200 --> 22:27.000]  parchment paper we have envelopes we have some of them combined we have the
[22:27.000 --> 22:30.760]  little plastic baggies actually we were doing some of the entries and at one
[22:30.760 --> 22:33.920]  point my friend and I that I've known since high school Richard I was like
[22:33.920 --> 22:38.000]  doesn't this remind you of Surrey Central Station because we were doing
[22:38.000 --> 22:44.280]  little dime bags right quarter pound or a half pound and I was like my fingers
[22:44.280 --> 22:48.000]  hurt how did we do this as teenagers and we all kind of start laughing as
[22:48.000 --> 22:50.920]  we're sitting around the table doing these little dime bags but yeah some of
[22:50.920 --> 22:56.320]  its in like old-school like I want to call it grassroots packaging where it's
[22:56.320 --> 23:02.080]  literally in a dime bag which looks like a little ziploc but it's super fun we
[23:02.080 --> 23:07.280]  did all of our tickets by hand like we were going to Mardi Gras and Nimbin so
[23:07.280 --> 23:12.800]  they're all hand stamped and hand put into a computer system the only thing
[23:12.800 --> 23:16.520]  that's not really going back to our roots is we've got some really cool
[23:16.520 --> 23:20.640]  lanyards that are coming out from Georgia specifically Atlanta and the
[23:20.640 --> 23:25.960]  next week I'm really happy that's happening we also have a couple of
[23:25.960 --> 23:34.800]  Americans that are coming in for our show which isn't very well I've had
[23:34.800 --> 23:38.360]  American and Australian guests but nobody who's actually been like I'm going to
[23:38.360 --> 23:42.040]  compete in your cup from over here and I was like that's a feet and a half and
[23:42.040 --> 23:46.200]  they managed to get their stuff in in fact they were the second sample to
[23:46.200 --> 23:52.160]  arrive at my door I was very impressed that the very other side of the United
[23:52.160 --> 24:02.200]  States was able to pull that off a second congrats by the way and and we'll
[24:02.200 --> 24:06.640]  add an allegedly we'll add an allegedly to the end of this just in case and
[24:06.640 --> 24:14.960]  allegedly I will say there's a there's some stuff in place that they did where
[24:14.960 --> 24:18.160]  like I actually got it and I was like well that's really cool I'm not gonna
[24:18.160 --> 24:23.560]  disclose what I looked at but I I didn't know what I had for almost nine days and
[24:23.560 --> 24:28.240]  then I got the call why haven't you posted any pictures of her stuff and I'm
[24:28.240 --> 24:34.200]  like what stuff and they're like oh my and so they disclosed with me what I
[24:34.200 --> 24:40.080]  actually had in my possession was like oh well isn't that fancy
[24:40.080 --> 24:46.120]  what I had actually had received but that was quite funny well why did I get
[24:46.120 --> 24:51.280]  a whole case of soldiers you know I did get a whole case of Folgers you know
[24:51.280 --> 24:59.920]  like what what happened I don't remember ordering coffee but yeah it's just like
[24:59.920 --> 25:05.160]  it's yeah you got to do the what's it what was this show damn it
[25:05.160 --> 25:10.360]  teaching John no the where he put where he packed it all I mean there was many
[25:10.360 --> 25:14.000]  shows but it was breaking bad was probably the most recent most popular
[25:14.000 --> 25:21.160]  one oh my goodness in the coffee pot when I retired for a little bit there so
[25:21.160 --> 25:25.440]  I could just do my thing that was my favorite hashtag breaking good breaking
[25:25.600 --> 25:32.120]  hell yeah hell yeah so you know I love I love cups and you know what one of the
[25:32.120 --> 25:35.840]  things is we've heard a lot of this there's a debate or arguments or people
[25:35.840 --> 25:38.400]  are Dixon they're like oh there's too many cups there's too many cups there's
[25:38.400 --> 25:42.840]  too many cups and like there's never enough cups you're right because guess
[25:42.840 --> 25:47.680]  what when you look at like like pageants like like just for example probably one
[25:47.680 --> 25:51.600]  of the worst look at that one of the worst business one of the worst cups or
[25:51.600 --> 25:55.400]  competitions ever is the child beauty pageant that's just like it's not
[25:55.400 --> 26:01.240]  probably great for human beings social behavior but if you look at that there's
[26:01.240 --> 26:05.920]  local regional like it's broken down each city and then each city is broken
[26:05.920 --> 26:09.680]  down into its different sections and each section has a competition right like
[26:09.680 --> 26:13.400]  that's where we need to be at for cannabis to really develop that's how
[26:13.400 --> 26:17.000]  you get to the next level of this stuff that's how you that's how you find out
[26:17.000 --> 26:21.120]  where a judge or our terroir is or how you develop these culture points is a
[26:21.120 --> 26:27.640]  you meet and create a community but you also compete and judge and compare and
[26:27.640 --> 26:33.120]  and develop and learn which is really awesome so I love love love love this
[26:33.120 --> 26:37.720]  type of thing what was what was the idea I mean you mentioned that it was it was
[26:37.720 --> 26:40.720]  started with kind of like an excuse for your birthday what is it turning into
[26:40.720 --> 26:45.920]  now what is the reasoning behind it behind it how were you trying to support
[26:45.920 --> 26:53.480]  it's a great excuse to see all of my friends and people in the industry it's
[26:53.480 --> 27:00.000]  also a great excuse to meet new people as we've done in the past we do a 5050
[27:00.000 --> 27:04.640]  so half is going to charity half is to help pay for the event and if we end up
[27:04.640 --> 27:08.560]  with a little bit extra it means we can invest that into next year's event but
[27:08.560 --> 27:11.840]  it's the same idea nothing's really changed just get all of our friends
[27:11.840 --> 27:15.760]  together except now we get to do it is a summer setting in a camping environment
[27:15.760 --> 27:19.560]  which is even more fun because a lot of people couldn't come out because there
[27:19.560 --> 27:22.800]  was nowhere for them to stay in the past they would either have to find
[27:22.800 --> 27:28.160]  accommodation or stay with a friend or something to that effect and yeah this
[27:28.160 --> 27:32.440]  year we've chosen a different charity what we normally would do in the past is
[27:32.440 --> 27:39.040]  we would use the 50% of the funding towards our brighter Christmas event
[27:39.040 --> 27:44.800]  that we would do and we would buy sleeping bags pillows clothing shoes in
[27:44.800 --> 27:49.800]  some cases accommodation food gift certificates all that for those people
[27:49.800 --> 27:53.800]  that were trying to move further we're going with the harvest projects we don't
[27:53.800 --> 28:00.680]  have our own program anymore and they help families both sides whether you
[28:00.680 --> 28:04.320]  have your children or not or whether if you have kids or not and they help you
[28:04.320 --> 28:08.760]  get on your feet and pay for part of your rent and help you either get
[28:08.760 --> 28:12.640]  employed again or on some sort of assistance so you're not left behind
[28:12.640 --> 28:18.640]  that's fantastic I love that you showed me when we first met you brought up
[28:18.640 --> 28:23.240]  their website on your phone and it's like my heart went out to those people
[28:23.240 --> 28:29.680]  that are in that situation for you to to give you know so much of a percentage to
[28:29.680 --> 28:35.760]  to help those people I love that agent I blessings love and London you're gonna
[28:35.760 --> 28:38.840]  love this they're actually out of the North Shore they help those in West
[28:38.840 --> 28:44.200]  Vancouver and North Vancouver awesome now this really warms my heart you know
[28:44.200 --> 28:49.420]  because there was like I we I mentioned briefly to you but a lot of the
[28:49.420 --> 28:52.000]  community already knows and I won't really go into the story for the
[28:52.000 --> 28:56.200]  hundredth thousand times but my firstborn was a surprise we didn't know
[28:56.200 --> 28:59.760]  she was pregnant my wife was very petite had the baby in the washroom
[28:59.760 --> 29:04.000]  just flash freak story naturally after that point in time you're kind of like
[29:04.000 --> 29:07.720]  what the fuck just happened like it's like a train wreck your your life is
[29:07.720 --> 29:10.880]  just completely turned upside down when you're not expecting something like that
[29:10.880 --> 29:15.640]  to happen and it happens and so you have to you have to rearrange and readjust
[29:15.640 --> 29:19.320]  right all of a sudden you're a parent out of nowhere and you got it you got to
[29:19.320 --> 29:24.040]  figure that out so we like oh let's stop smoking weed for a bit bad choice really
[29:24.160 --> 29:27.400]  bad choice but one of the things I was really fortunate because we was like
[29:27.400 --> 29:30.300]  okay I have to reevaluate I have to step back from what I'm doing because I'm
[29:30.300 --> 29:33.600]  working 16 hours a day seven days a week at a high-end restaurant downtown
[29:33.600 --> 29:38.080]  Vancouver I can't work like this and have a family like I just there's no I
[29:38.080 --> 29:43.140]  sleep and I work that's it like there's no there's no room in this life for the
[29:43.140 --> 29:46.760]  children so I had to I had to figure out how to adjust that and change that and
[29:46.760 --> 29:53.160]  readjust my priorities luckily you know when you work 15 some odd years in the
[29:53.160 --> 29:55.920]  restaurant industry and that's all you've ever done and ever known
[29:55.920 --> 30:01.040]  switching away from that is not exactly an easy task right like trying to
[30:01.040 --> 30:04.360]  readjust and find a new step in where you make an equivalent amount of money
[30:04.360 --> 30:08.640]  and when you go through turmoil and challenges and you decide you know like
[30:08.640 --> 30:12.520]  let's say let's separate for a month or two and see how things go and like you'd
[30:12.520 --> 30:15.960]  like come back together we're married now and have two kids but it's like we
[30:15.960 --> 30:19.760]  would try and figure out what the fuck just happened with us in our lives when
[30:19.760 --> 30:23.360]  you're going through that type of thing we had a lot of support from our family
[30:23.360 --> 30:27.440]  we were really blessed I'm really really lucky because I have I was born with two
[30:27.440 --> 30:30.920]  but I got two families my parents split up when I was one one family is a little
[30:30.920 --> 30:34.960]  bit further away and ones locally and we were able to move into the basement
[30:34.960 --> 30:40.000]  suite you're like help us with everything and so much help like we had
[30:40.000 --> 30:43.720]  to I was it down I was part in downtown in Vancouver at the time I literally had
[30:43.720 --> 30:46.400]  to sell everything in my apartment because it was a child safe and it
[30:46.400 --> 30:50.240]  partied on for years like I'm like I'm not putting a kid in this I had to really
[30:50.240 --> 30:55.640]  all new fresh and luckily I had family to support me not everybody is blessed
[30:55.640 --> 31:02.720]  like that man most people don't get that unfortunately so programs like this are
[31:02.720 --> 31:08.400]  just so goddamn important when it comes to taking community and moving that
[31:08.400 --> 31:13.680]  forward and and I really love that we as a community can get together and commune
[31:13.680 --> 31:19.440]  about what we are most passionate about but we can also get together and support
[31:19.440 --> 31:24.120]  and drive money and and support this community as well and people that are
[31:24.120 --> 31:28.480]  outside of ours because that that that has waves right now now I mean you're
[31:28.480 --> 31:32.960]  probably not telling them where the money came from actually we told one of
[31:32.960 --> 31:36.200]  our sponsors we all I was like listen all we told them is three happy cats
[31:36.200 --> 31:40.800]  entertainment is gonna help them out and we left it at that because we also as we
[31:40.800 --> 31:45.360]  have before in the past is we're having another XX entertainment evening to kind
[31:45.360 --> 31:49.520]  of help with getting their packs and some funding in the door and I'm not
[31:49.520 --> 31:54.640]  sure if Donna and the team would be like oh great we're glad you stripped down
[31:54.640 --> 31:59.400]  some famous pot activists and entertainers to get us some funding
[31:59.400 --> 32:14.720]  and you know what it's it's better to give quietly than give loudly you know
[32:14.720 --> 32:19.920]  what I mean and that says so much more about what you're doing than any
[32:19.920 --> 32:25.440]  fucking business that takes that takes the tax cut you know what I mean that
[32:25.440 --> 32:30.160]  that claims that that that that donation on their taxes and doesn't have
[32:30.160 --> 32:34.280]  to pay that into taxes and does that when you're naughty like you oh here you
[32:34.280 --> 32:38.840]  go you know here's it here's this thing and I can't I'm not even really gonna
[32:38.840 --> 32:42.560]  tell you where it's from you know and these things have cultural impacts and
[32:42.560 --> 32:46.680]  weight right like whether whether whether they know it or not or whether
[32:46.680 --> 32:51.840]  it is or not that money came from this community and we will say that we made
[32:51.840 --> 32:55.760]  that money happen for that community and it will happen regardless and there
[32:55.760 --> 33:00.080]  won't be credit given to it but it doesn't matter it's not what it's about
[33:01.000 --> 33:06.120]  and that's the opposite of what everyone complained about cannabis for so long
[33:06.120 --> 33:10.960]  oh they're terrible evil evil human beings and like oh yeah no we're like
[33:10.960 --> 33:14.920]  literally trying to raise money for families and people around us you know
[33:14.920 --> 33:20.840]  they also really call baby go round and they service the entire Lower Mainland
[33:20.840 --> 33:25.240]  so someone who has a new baby or maybe doesn't know what they're doing they
[33:25.240 --> 33:31.720]  literally bring in the safety plugs jolly jumpers strollers baby seats high
[33:31.720 --> 33:36.040]  chairs they bring it all in provides the nothing in return to don't they they
[33:36.040 --> 33:40.760]  provide the your initial pumps I think as well I actually use that program and
[33:40.760 --> 33:47.800]  it's we got our first breath they no problem $150 like expensive reps pump
[33:47.800 --> 33:52.600]  here just there you go like just take it we still have it it doesn't work
[33:52.600 --> 33:57.640]  anymore but we still have it it needs a gland or something you know but yeah
[33:57.640 --> 34:01.080]  it's and it was just like that that doesn't happen in other parts of the
[34:01.080 --> 34:04.480]  world man that doesn't we're so blessed to have that here but it's also because
[34:04.480 --> 34:08.240]  there's communities like ourselves that are doing this to help support these
[34:08.240 --> 34:12.520]  things and put that forward so know that if you're going to this event that you
[34:12.520 --> 34:16.200]  that you're not only supporting and supporting and developing industry
[34:16.200 --> 34:20.360]  whether it's illegal or gray or wet ever happens to be but you're also
[34:20.360 --> 34:24.200]  supporting community and and that's what that's what it's about right that's what
[34:24.200 --> 34:28.400]  that's what I think it's but and for Ellie those that are listening right now
[34:28.400 --> 34:35.120]  if it's in your power to donate other an item to baby go round they take only
[34:35.120 --> 34:41.440]  baby items or if you can donate also an item to the harvest project it doesn't
[34:41.440 --> 34:46.040]  have to be a silly be a big item but we take $50 off of your judges kit
[34:46.040 --> 34:50.160]  if you're able to donate to one of those two organizations if you're in the
[34:50.160 --> 34:54.160]  area it can be an item it doesn't necessarily have to be money but they
[34:54.160 --> 34:58.000]  normally write you just a little slip for tax purposes and you just send us a
[34:58.000 --> 35:06.320]  screenshot or a picture of that and we'll take $50 off your ticket and so
[35:06.320 --> 35:11.640]  but also like so when you give the like can you give like you know maybe older
[35:11.640 --> 35:16.000]  toys that are still in great quality that are for kids awesome because tell
[35:16.000 --> 35:20.600]  you what I'm gonna do is we actually bought we bought an acre of land in
[35:20.600 --> 35:26.600]  Italy this year so we're actually moving there in December and I have a ton of
[35:26.600 --> 35:31.120]  really amazing kids toys and all of our stuff that we will not be able to bring
[35:31.120 --> 35:34.480]  with us and instead of selling them we'll give them away at the end of the
[35:34.480 --> 35:39.800]  year that's wonderful thank you so much unity okay that we will have every last
[35:39.800 --> 35:45.720]  bit thank you brother but we can't we can't strip my kids of it until
[35:45.720 --> 35:50.560]  December though okay so we'll do it we'll do it as a Christmas thing okay
[35:50.560 --> 35:55.160]  okay they'll kill me if they're like short toys for that long they'll be like
[35:55.160 --> 36:00.240]  what the fuck dad you're too nice yeah but yeah we've got stuff and we keep
[36:00.240 --> 36:02.760]  getting stuff cuz it's like their birthdays are coming I was like why are
[36:02.760 --> 36:06.040]  you giving us stuff we don't we don't want your stuff and I'm also just I I
[36:06.040 --> 36:11.320]  love kids toys and I get it but you know they're most of the plastics that kid
[36:11.320 --> 36:16.920]  toys are made out of our single-use right you can't actually recycle them
[36:16.920 --> 36:20.880]  it's crazy like they're not a qualified recyclable plastic you go to the dump
[36:20.880 --> 36:24.200]  and it's like oh you go to the recycling depot and you can't recycle it but you
[36:24.200 --> 36:28.320]  got to take that plastic to the dump you have to and it's just like it's
[36:28.320 --> 36:32.680]  mind-blowing to me and then it's like okay because if they have the battery
[36:32.680 --> 36:36.440]  pack still in them you can't recycle them you're supposed to pay to have them
[36:36.440 --> 36:41.200]  recycled so they normally cost more than what they're worth than it is to give it
[36:41.200 --> 36:44.880]  to somebody or like you know clean it up and donate it or whatever it is you
[36:44.880 --> 36:49.640]  want to do but yeah I spent $100 once getting rid of mind you they were like
[36:49.640 --> 36:53.760]  broken beyond repair but because they had those battery trays them I don't
[36:53.760 --> 36:56.720]  know what the right word is but that's where the batteries go in that made
[36:56.720 --> 37:02.160]  some sort of hazard and so they needed to be recycled appropriately and they
[37:02.160 --> 37:06.720]  needed a disposing fee for each item which is just
[37:07.440 --> 37:12.760]  on if you can you know what I mean and and and and we all know that life isn't
[37:12.760 --> 37:17.880]  you know with with with all these stupid stretches of inflation all these other
[37:17.880 --> 37:21.080]  problems in life and stuff like that there's probably lots of people that
[37:21.080 --> 37:24.280]  need help like this right now so like get out in the into your community no
[37:24.280 --> 37:27.760]  matter where it is check out these programs and find out where they are but
[37:27.760 --> 37:39.480]  if you're in BC you could come for these programs and smoke weed yeah and
[37:39.480 --> 37:45.720]  you can get $50 off of your judges pack if you donate and show the receipt
[37:45.720 --> 37:50.720]  you'll get yeah so you can get cannabis you can help and get a discount doing it
[37:50.720 --> 37:57.720]  hey gotta love it man win-win-win so Asia you've got you sent me some stuff
[37:57.720 --> 38:02.480]  what I was down there we got is this one of the companies that's also supporting
[38:02.480 --> 38:08.400]  you this 420 maps they are they're absolutely amazing guys they've helped
[38:08.400 --> 38:12.680]  us bring a snack the Ripper and merculis to the beach for July 1st for everyone
[38:12.680 --> 38:19.000]  to see for free and they've helped me get some kits together in fact all of
[38:19.000 --> 38:23.760]  the kids so that was super awesome of them to help with that as well we have
[38:23.760 --> 38:27.240]  oh my goodness there's so many different companies that have gotten involved we
[38:27.240 --> 38:34.200]  have the underground we have med man we have ounces only we have burr fellows
[38:34.200 --> 38:41.280]  yeah so that's a funny story so that's thrive and I have a contact list from
[38:41.280 --> 38:44.360]  people I've worked with in the past and I contacted one of my friends who owned
[38:44.360 --> 38:50.840]  a dispensary and she says I don't I don't sell weed anymore I do thrive okay
[38:50.840 --> 38:55.120]  and so she gave me a whole bunch of thrive packs to give to people because
[38:55.120 --> 39:00.480]  she's not doing cannabis which is totally fine with me I'm trying to think
[39:00.480 --> 39:05.520]  of all the people that are contributing we have the 420 professor we have oh that
[39:05.520 --> 39:14.040]  is a distillate and that is from the underground yeah yeah and it looks like
[39:14.040 --> 39:17.800]  a phoenix tear type of distillate to me is that correct it's actually distillate
[39:17.800 --> 39:23.920]  but you can't eat it I did eat half of one of those and it was really strong so
[39:23.920 --> 39:28.000]  I don't recommend eating half maybe a quarter of it if you want to eat it but
[39:28.000 --> 39:32.600]  it tastes really good to distill it so I recommend you smoke it but yeah I don't
[39:32.600 --> 39:35.840]  think there's any cannabis products you can't actually eat is there just the
[39:35.840 --> 39:40.160]  whole problem is of whether it's decarboxylated or not yeah and whether
[39:40.160 --> 39:44.840]  there's a bunch of chemicals in it or not like myself I only grow organic but
[39:44.840 --> 39:47.880]  there's a lot of people that grow with salts and you got to watch what you're
[39:47.880 --> 39:53.880]  eating when you're consuming it that way yeah for sure I got one more creamy
[39:53.880 --> 39:58.320]  thing and this guys this is what Asia sent my wife who doesn't consume
[39:58.320 --> 40:07.800]  cannabis other than gummies but I've got this little creamy now there's no
[40:07.800 --> 40:14.400]  name on the package for what it is but that's the name on the package for who
[40:14.400 --> 40:21.800]  it is if I can get it I'll have to go in tighter try that yes so Golden Coast
[40:21.800 --> 40:27.800]  actually helped me with the cannabis day event they are not participating in the
[40:27.800 --> 40:32.200]  mom cup I had a bunch of stuff left over and when I am s so I was like hey
[40:32.200 --> 40:35.400]  man just so you know I've got like a big bag full of your stuff what do I do with
[40:35.400 --> 40:39.400]  it they're like give it out at the mom cup so I was like I can do that no
[40:39.400 --> 40:44.480]  problem so yeah I think I had like 50 containers of their stuff which is quite
[40:44.480 --> 40:48.120]  a bit of stuff but they were like yeah just give it to your media guys your
[40:48.120 --> 40:51.000]  friends or put them in your kids or whatever you feel like so that was
[40:51.000 --> 40:55.540]  really nice of them Bubba King got the same boat they helped us with cannabis
[40:55.540 --> 41:00.500]  day by bringing merculis and snack the ripper to the beach we also had a golden
[41:00.500 --> 41:05.420]  BSB called come down as well he was kind of called at the last minute but I was
[41:05.420 --> 41:09.580]  super happy that he showed up but yeah Bubba Kings those same thing I'm like
[41:09.580 --> 41:13.660]  I've got like a whole bunch of of your containers and some of your weed what am
[41:13.660 --> 41:17.260]  I doing he's like rolling it up and giving it away and I was like done so
[41:17.260 --> 41:21.800]  yeah there's a couple people that have had some extra stuff left over that have
[41:21.800 --> 41:28.800]  let us keep it or give it away and in one case we had this bong that got left
[41:28.800 --> 41:34.400]  behind and so we had a big raffle and nice lady from Nova Scotia just won it I
[41:34.400 --> 41:40.920]  believe she's received it by now darn is shipping expensive these days
[41:40.920 --> 41:48.960]  if they wanted $130 to get in a week and it was like $58 if we let it go for
[41:48.960 --> 41:53.560]  like three weeks so I chose the $58 option just because that's quite a
[41:53.560 --> 41:58.640]  price difference and it usually gets there in a week that's the funny part
[41:58.640 --> 42:02.560]  what the lady at the counter said she's like by the way it's only gonna be off
[42:02.560 --> 42:06.320]  by a couple days and I was like really and she's like yes it's never gonna be
[42:06.320 --> 42:09.800]  three weeks so don't worry about it so like all right I can go with that I can
[42:09.800 --> 42:14.000]  tell you why because I was the truck driver that actually ran team and you
[42:14.000 --> 42:18.960]  can make Edmonton to Toronto in 22 hours you can go across the country in
[42:18.960 --> 42:28.800]  five days no it doesn't say save the thrips it says save the Terps that is
[42:28.800 --> 42:39.400]  that is a Johnny D special yeah it's a bivita branded is a bivita so Vita yeah
[42:39.400 --> 42:48.680]  it's part of their main branding the Terps save the Terps on the on the brow
[42:48.680 --> 42:56.400]  of course you know so Johnny B has sponsored the cup we have med tainers in
[42:56.400 --> 43:01.680]  our special online kits only however that's a really special treat for our
[43:01.680 --> 43:06.240]  online judges and then he's also sponsored us through boveda he's given
[43:06.240 --> 43:11.160]  all of our regular kits a boveda pack which is gonna keep all of our bud
[43:11.160 --> 43:15.920]  samples in it that is just that's it right there and they'll have all of your
[43:15.920 --> 43:20.400]  weed samples to judge in it and it'll keep the smell out of the bag is our
[43:20.400 --> 43:26.360]  first set of kits apparently our first set of kits smell really really nice
[43:26.400 --> 43:29.600]  so I got some feedback where they're like what are we gonna do about it Johnny
[43:29.600 --> 43:33.440]  B is like we're gonna put them in the beta packs and I was like okay so let's

[47:15.400 --> 47:18.960]  like oh well I'll tell you all about the male dancers that I've been hunting down
[47:18.960 --> 47:26.160]  across Canada for this event he's not quite sure what he's been volunteered
[47:26.160 --> 47:34.680]  for and that's we also have the owner and manager of Ripper State magazine who
[47:34.680 --> 47:42.560]  will also be stripping down to help out with this show Ali Katz partner who is
[47:42.560 --> 47:48.320]  kind of an underground pod activist will also be stripping down to the nitty
[47:48.320 --> 47:53.920]  gritties and we will be doing a exotic painting with our activists and we will
[47:53.920 --> 47:58.640]  be using the painting for the auction same thing but roles reversed for the
[47:58.640 --> 48:03.560]  other evening it'll be myself and Ali Katz doing an exotic painting which will
[48:03.560 --> 48:08.800]  also go up for auction and we're gonna have poker on the side for everyone and
[48:08.800 --> 48:15.440]  infused drinks so we're doing merrill what did he call them marijuano so instead of
[48:15.440 --> 48:22.640]  mojitos they will be marijuana infused style mojitos marijuano and everything on them
[48:22.640 --> 48:31.000]  gonjitos gonjitos gonjitos that's a good name I like that too yeah the other day
[48:31.000 --> 48:36.280]  I said ganja and somebody said what was that and I just kept walking no I'm just
[48:36.280 --> 48:42.400]  kidding I'm like okay I'm gonna need to need to have a good conversation with
[48:42.400 --> 48:49.560]  you right now I need to smoke some ganja before I have that conversation with you
[48:50.520 --> 48:56.680]  something along those lines yeah but anyways so if we're looking at that and
[48:56.920 --> 49:02.760]  so we talked about both days what's going on there the glass speakers I love the glass stuff
[49:02.760 --> 49:09.280]  and that is not a cheap or easy thing to put together so I'm really excited to see that the
[49:09.280 --> 49:13.880]  live glass bowling and then there's camping involved so is it all ages can people bring
[49:13.880 --> 49:18.680]  the whole family the whole van damly down or they bring the whole family with you however if you
[49:18.680 --> 49:23.560]  have kids that are 18 and under you guys are gonna you and your mother or you and your father gonna
[49:23.560 --> 49:28.600]  have a matching wristband other mom or dad needs to kind of make sure kids are staying out of
[49:28.600 --> 49:32.400]  trouble and they can go anywhere they want on the grounds but they're not allowed in the VIP
[49:32.400 --> 49:38.040]  house just given we have x-rated entertainment and it's a closed space where pot smoke obviously
[49:38.040 --> 49:41.880]  can't get out of the window so we're just gonna keep kids out of the VIP house but other than
[49:41.880 --> 49:49.520]  that have fun enjoy the grounds and we actually split up the XXX entertainment normally it's all
[49:49.520 --> 49:56.320]  in one night but we kind of thought that because parents would be coming out say mom can take the
[49:56.320 --> 50:02.000]  kids on the guys entertainment night and dad can go out and explore the grounds and go the VIP
[50:02.000 --> 50:06.480]  house and they can swap off for the other night so that way they kind of get a night designated
[50:06.480 --> 50:12.200]  to girls or guys and then you give them a chance to do their thing and then also with having all
[50:12.200 --> 50:17.320]  of that in one particular area and like you know a closed off door where children can't see they
[50:17.320 --> 50:27.720]  can actually come to the event where we haven't been able to do that before I love the community
[50:27.720 --> 50:31.800]  stuff when you're able to have that that closeness and it's okay to bring the family and me don't
[50:31.800 --> 50:37.040]  get me wrong there's places for your children to be in places for your children not to be but it
[50:37.040 --> 50:42.560]  but to completely exclude them all the time it's dependent you know what I mean like if it and and
[50:42.560 --> 50:48.760]  sometimes it's better to have some that are more family oriented like I know like depending on the
[50:48.760 --> 50:53.160]  demographic page there's gonna be a lot of people with kids and if you're completely restricted from
[50:53.160 --> 50:58.280]  being able to go to these events it kind of really sucks as someone with a kid you know just saying
[50:58.280 --> 51:00.200]  flat-out like it just sucks
[51:00.200 --> 51:06.200]  Any bouncy castles for London to get into you know and show us kids how to do backflips?
[51:07.200 --> 51:09.800]  No please no because they'll break a neck
[51:09.800 --> 51:36.040]  For example, Unicorn Cup we're going and the whole family's coming up with us but we have an off-site camp spot that's closer to the Shambala so it's like a little bit of a ways in but it's not directly there they've managed to accommodate us and help us out but regardless it would be kind of nice if I was like you know if it was right there and you'll pop in so I'm excited to have this this availability and closeness it's there
[51:36.440 --> 51:43.720]  And we booked off the time we make sure that we're not covered so we'll be there on the Saturday and the Sunday for Sherzies
[51:43.720 --> 52:05.960]  Yeah no problem and that's the wonderful thing about your $50 pass you're allowed in and out at your discretion at any time however the parking lots if you plan to go in and out you're going to have to be parked at the beginning so that is a bit of a walk but if you're just staying for the whole weekend you can go in our main lot and just park it there but once 10 o'clock hits there'll be no staff to help with in and out services
[52:05.960 --> 52:15.320]  So if you plan to do a lot of in and outs you'll have to park at the front as opposed to the main parking lot just so that you can get in and out without any complications
[52:15.320 --> 52:19.320]  Awesome, awesome, awesome
[52:19.320 --> 52:27.320]  So how are people, do you have like a payment system set up like how are you guys, are you able to pay online or is it through e-transfer?
[52:27.320 --> 52:35.320]  You can either pay through e-transfer, PayPal or you can meet us at our headquarters and pay with cash or you can pay at the door as well
[52:35.720 --> 52:55.720]  Okay awesome, awesome well next time if you guys need a payment processor for next year that can just do tap and debits and stuff like that we work with, we actually have one of the sponsors of our show, Ken's trying, Chen you talked with Jack earlier this week that specifically they work payment processing systems for cannabis businesses so because you know how challenging that is right?
[52:55.720 --> 53:03.720]  Oh wonderful yeah because back in the day when I had my dispensary in Headshop at one point the bank discovered that I had a dispensary
[53:04.120 --> 53:24.120]  And they shut down everything and it was like quite devastating because I wasn't even in the country when they shut everything down and I went to go pay for like a dollar parking and Australian currency is like lower than ours so it was like maybe 71 cents Canadian right and it was like payment declined and I was like I don't know what the fuck is this 71 cents decline man
[53:24.120 --> 53:34.520]  I'm glad things are turning around because in the middle of all that hype there a lot of people are getting hit with banks shutting them down and yeah that was a big problem
[53:34.520 --> 53:45.720]  It's still a big problem and it's still a major, major, major issue there's a lot of people that have challenges with it so we do have, we have community that helps with that type of thing that's great that I can connect you with if you'd like
[53:45.720 --> 53:52.760]  And then what else, what else do we have Ken? What else do we have going on? Anything else we need to dig into?
[53:53.560 --> 54:06.200]  Well we've got so much going on between your doing some more tasting on the Unicorn Cup to you know the conversations with you know Leighton and Brian on Living Soils
[54:06.760 --> 54:14.680]  There's just so much information coming out on a regular basis here that we can't even stop
[54:14.680 --> 54:20.680]  Everybody's going it's almost too much but pick and choose the shows you want to come on and watch and learn from
[54:20.680 --> 54:30.040]  But Asia I love what you're doing I love the passion that you have for this we've been doing this for decades you've been all over the world
[54:30.040 --> 54:40.040]  And I know you said when you went to Australia the first time you know there was there was quite a few people but the last time you went it was a massive movement and that's what we're trying to create here
[54:40.040 --> 54:41.400]  That's true yes
[54:41.480 --> 54:56.440]  We want to create that movement around the globe not just on cannabis but on growing whether you're growing your own food whether you're growing your own medicine but we just need to grow and form community and work together and I love what you do
[54:56.440 --> 54:58.440]  Thank you
[54:58.440 --> 55:10.920]  You know if I can bring that home a little bit too that's a big part of it like I actually when I had to step off I took a phone call from Shannon Ross and we were talking about she's been a lifetime farmer and works in the cannabis space
[55:11.000 --> 55:38.200]  And we were chatting about because I worked as a restaurant space she actually worked for some of the companies I used to purchase off of for for produce and stuff like that and one of the things that that I always like to punch home is like the regenerative practices and that regenerative community has another community that is so closely assembled to it and is what the most mainstream and touched area in the world is food
[55:38.200 --> 56:06.920]  Right all the regenerative practice everything that we believe in when it comes to what's natural organic what's good and healthy for us or what's what's of the earth is happening through the regenerative movement but we also can apply all the same applications to understanding and everything that we do and eat through consumption and through events like this that create community we drive these agendas and push into these other things so thank you for holding one of these events and being a passionate advocate for the space for so long
[56:11.850 --> 56:12.650]  And with that
[56:14.970 --> 56:25.210]  And with that Mae I always like to finish it like this where can people get a hold of you last plug last chance where can they learn about you and get get in to know a little bit more about the mom cup
[56:26.090 --> 56:38.650]  Other come to our three happy cats page on Facebook or you can reach me at mom cup 2022 at gmail.com or if you're old fashioned like myself 6048386384
[56:39.610 --> 56:46.330]  Awesome and all of that is in the description and thank you again we will play out and
[56:48.090 --> 56:52.570]  Where is it there it is I like this song for my play out we'll do the banner
[56:55.930 --> 57:00.970]  And thank you again see you all later today we'll do a tasting of the unicorn cup if we can
[57:01.690 --> 57:08.970]  Yes we got it we got it I got to start I'm nervous because I got a smart start consuming the extracts and the hash and stuff
[57:08.970 --> 57:10.970]  Oh don't be nervous it'll be good I've heard
[57:10.970 --> 57:12.970]  I know it'll be it'll it'll be wonderful
[57:12.970 --> 57:14.970]  You should be holding on to your seat by the time you're finished
[57:14.970 --> 57:30.010]  It's good I've already worked through the 32 30 something like 40 I think a 50 or something flowers that were submitted between LLP and personal production we've tasted every single one of them live all the way through we're at over
[57:31.130 --> 57:38.170]  Over easily over 12 000 hits on on just the judging portion for the unicorn cups and we still have to go through
[57:38.170 --> 57:46.410]  the the 20 something or 30 something um extracts to dig into so it's it's it's a ride and I love it and
[57:46.410 --> 57:50.970]  there's like that being said the stuff that comes out of this community is fantastic and there is
[57:50.970 --> 57:55.210]  some really great flower and there's some really great products out there so I'm excited I'm excited
[57:55.210 --> 57:59.130]  but yes we will end the broadcast and thanks again for
