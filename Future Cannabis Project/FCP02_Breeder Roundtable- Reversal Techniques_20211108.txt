Always love your conversations man. It's always always learn something new
Well, I think we just
Can you hear us yeah, I can hear you okay. Yeah. No, I was just saying always love these conversations
I always learn something new
Was the it's the people that make the conversation so
Fortunately we have a smart group and
So while we're waiting for Tyler
One of the things that I thought would be interesting since it's kind of the end of the season if you guys want to kind
Of go around the horn talking about
like for example, mr. Toad, would you
What are some of the crosses or lines coming out?
in the next month or two
Hi, Tony
For Russell, what uh, what'd you chop and what are you what are you running on the hash front?
well
We're I'm a bit split between worlds there Pete. I got I got my day job, you know where I'm working
As a farm manager, so I don't get always don't get to take what I want to run on the day job
but they're there for processing a lot of cushments and white runs and
Few other varieties but
I'm more interested in the breeding projects. I'm working on right now, which is just heavily, you know
like my focus is on terpenes and
Terpene expression I've been working a little bit with the skittles guys like the turpogs and we I like I'm just a fan of the skittles
turps
So I've been working on some projects with that and been running some projects with gelanade
Gelanades another good one and we got across that into the slaps. The slaps is the runs crossed with grease monkey
so
Right now right now I'm really just the initial stages of like the exploration of breeding for
different terpene variations
So it's fun. It's exciting
And what uh, what stood out for you this year?
Probably
That gelanade slaps came out the most unique it had this like lemon citrusy funky
twist kind of
Just just like with almost hints of chocolate in it when you get lemon and chocolate together and the terpene profiles that uh
It's it's just unique it's it's different
Especially with hash making everyone's looking for like the strains that are you know
Just high like really the Holy Grail is to find something that's really terpy and also yields, you know, really well
For hash for concentrate. So I've got a buddy of mine. He's kind of like a solvent this wizard guy
I don't he doesn't he likes to remain anonymous, but he he's really the genius behind all of this and
He's just always looking for
for the new
New terps, but mainly just with the higher
Obviously like unfortunately to some degree in the industry or in it comes down to you know
Mark the you know the bottom line, which is just like is it does it yield? Well, I
Don't I don't think like that I'm more of like a skittle. I'm like if it tastes good
I like it better than if it yields well, but you know, it's it's a fine
Look, it's a fine line when you're walking between
You know commercial sector and the home gardening sector
It's kind of funny it's funny because I get to see both the world
But uh
Yeah, I'm kind I got to probably cut and run here peaks. I'm about to be
Involved with some pretty heavy loud machinery equipment here
So it's always a pleasure if you want to put me on mute for now, so you guys aren't inundated with sound. I'd be great
Well, you can't that that you can
I'm gonna teach you how to fish you can actually mute mute yourself. One of the one of the future topics
is actually I think gonna be
like different resin types and obviously
Oh
Yeah, that's a big one greasy versus waxy versus tack greasy versus tacky or oily versus tacky
Yeah
People don't give enough I guess respect to the the fat and
lipids that are in cannabis that
give that that greasiness to
Cultivars that we like that. I don't think that it's all just
Cannabinoid
Terpene and ester driven. I think that uh, you know, there's definitely some other things that are in play when it comes to that
Yeah, I have a lot of questions about that I
tons of questions about that so anyone that would be if anyone wants to has detailed knowledge on
What makes those different greasy versus tacky or oily versus tacky? I would love to hear
Why what sort of oil lipids or like esters as you say like
Distinguishes the difference between those I've always heard the one thing I've heard is that if it's oily or greasy
It's not gonna yield well, but if it's more tacky, it's gonna have a higher yield and concentrate wash
That's about the only thing that I've come up with but I've loved it. If anyone has any science about that, that'd be great
Mine's more anecdotal just what I've experienced in the field more. So I think Trevor might be a
little bit more
better on the articulation of
how that affects plants
But you know, obviously tricone head size what you are using from your bags
You know all those things make a difference
You know all those things make a difference
When you're making ice water hash rosin
you know for me, I just got my new home set of
extractor bags that
They're extremely overpriced
there are a thousand dollar set of
Hash bags, but at the same time I know that you know
These things pretty much will last forever and as long as they're well taken care of but I don't use all of the bags
That are even
Available there that I'm not a big fan of using the little duffel bags
I like just using a working bag and then for myself
I primarily like a 220, a 190, a 160 and a 45
but obviously
You know, that's just me being easy peasy
whenever I'm making meds at the house and
Just
Trying to make things as easy as possible just because there's a big difference when you are
Doing stuff in a commercial setting where you know, you have everything accessible versus, you know having to do things where you know
You just start making things work because that's what's available
I did try buying one of those Yeti five-gallon buckets just because they're insulated
That has been not the the greatest
Thing just because most bags don't stretch over those very well, but at the same time
Back to what you were saying for me. It all boils down to obviously trichome head size
I think that the fats and lipids though are definitely going to make a difference in
Just how those trichome heads will break off
Obviously zero degrees centigrade or 32 degrees
But it's also a matter of being in a climate controlled room
I know that I used to like to make hash whenever I was doing it at my house or black market
was during the winter months whenever there was snow on the ground where I can
Bunch up everything and I can put my buckets directly into the snow pile and I can use that for being able to
maintain temperature
That is it's no more challenging. Sometimes if you're using rudimentary
Things like even your trash can having something that's really flimsy versus having like a brute brand trash can has been
no, even the little things that you do make a difference in regards to yield, but
I know that for me what I stereotypically see as a return on
ice water hash
Rosen from a fresh frozen
About 3% return is what I'm seeing
on the average
And I know that there's companies like pure pressure that has like a really nice list that they will give
to the public in regards to what cultivars will wash well that they're aware of and then obviously I think
some of your outlets like dark heart
You know some of your other nursery providers
You know are able to recommend what cultivars do well
I have found that you know
People will say that this cultivar does well and this cultivar doesn't and I've had where it's the complete opposite
I've had it worse the same so for me
You know
I like to just get my hands on pretty much anything material wise that I can run and do at least you know a
five gallon
Batch before it goes into the rootless system from pure pressure
Trevor you there
And you gotta unmute yourself
and I know Tony's in the chat too, so
There he is. Hey, sorry guys. Yeah, I'm driving. I should be home here in
15 minutes or so, but yeah, I just hopped on and I'm listening
well, actually Trevor talked about the
Since I'm staring at a lot of packs that have the
88 g13 hash plant you want to talk about that plan
Okay, yeah 88 g13 hash plant is a
Variety that has been maintained and a lot of different people have used it it was
Preserved by somebody who went by the name Indian guy on the forums
He
Handed it out and
Did some breeding with it?
Him and a friend a forum friend who went by the name of swampy did some work together and
They gave out the 88 g13 hash plant with a
Condition attached to it that it couldn't be sold
So the pure 88 g13 hash plant has been
Maintained and preserved by a number of different people subsequent to them Bodhi worked with it
Hayes man worked with it and a number of other people have
worked with it in different ways either by holding on to the g hash clone only or by
Maintaining and preserving the seed line and eventually
Farmer Joe 420 he got the
The 88 g13 hash plant and did a reproduction of it and released those
So those were the most recent reproductions that got released
That was probably in like I think 18 or 19
But the variety it's been maintained by lots of different people over the years it's given out for free
And it's used as breeding stock
Bodhi used it and made tons of crosses
What we found is that it's a nice short squat uniform plant
produces
Very very sturdy stout plants that have a uniform branching pattern
It's a little bit on the leafy side
But particularly outdoors
Indoors it has much better bag appeal and a much better structure
It seems like it's a plant that was bred and used much more indoors than outdoors historically which makes sense because
the 88 88 g13 hash plant came from the seed bank and
that was Neville stock and
the hash plant was
The hash plant was actually crossed to the northern lights one supposedly and that was the male that was then hit to the
g13
And all of those plants from the northern lights to the hash plant to the g13
Are classic quote-unquote indica
And they're all over the place
The northern lights to the hash plant to the g13
are classic quote-unquote indica afghani short squat
indoor plants and
Yeah, it's it's really known for producing
Very quick flowering times very potent sedative
indica type
highs
quote-unquote indica
And yeah, so it's a banger it's really good breeding stock and it's something that's been maintained in a pure state for
Roughly 30 years now
So it's something that I would encourage people if you ever get the opportunity to get some pure 88 g13 hash plant
to
Get it and grow it out and to breed with it because it's something that is really definitely worth
Breeding with it crosses really really well with a lot of different things
We found that it pairs well and lets things
Whatever it crosses to it oftentimes shines lets the thing that it's crossed to shine through so
We've got the chemd
Cross to it and you'll get really really intense chem garlicky type venos
We've crossed it to the royal you've got a bunch of the royal crosses there
and it'll let that purple cush kind of royal flavor come through while
increasing the yields and giving a bit bigger of a bud structure to the plants because royal's kind of got a
A tight compact nug. This is much more of a larger robust nug structure that you get from the
from the 88
and
yeah, so let's
That's what I'd
Say about that plant. It's great breeding material
If you can get the crosses get the crosses if you can get the pure get the pure and rock it out
Trevor what kind of flowering time does that cultivar have?
It's got a pretty short flowering time
It can be done in around 50 to 60 days and
I'm outdoors typically
so my experience with it has been in outdoor runs and
I find that it's done in the first week or two of October here in
in NorCal, so
For me it's something that is a reliable
early harvest that I can get in before any of the rains or the
the intense weather comes through
Yeah, that's great we can go into that more because I mean you basically use that as the male and everything and I kind of was
curious, uh
and you
You kind of laid out kind of what you like about it and what it passes on and what it let shine through from the female
So that was awesome
uh
Mr. Trees the man who uh in this kind of BYO
Bring your own topic the man who brought uh today's main topic. Do you want to set the table?
And you got to unmute yourself
Yeah, got it. Got it. Got it. How's everybody doing man? Everybody's doing good today, I hope
I am uh, i'm blasting off i'm sitting here, uh burning on some some killer stuff. I got some ice cream cake crosses and
Some bacon dog all kinds of fun stuff, but
You know, yeah, I was I was thinking about reversals and i've been doing a lot more of them. Um over the last year i've been
you know doing tons of different experiments and different, uh, you know ways to
Get more pollen, you know what I mean? Uh, there's different lighting techniques. There's uh, you know indoor outdoor
there's different products, but
there's a couple of things that um
That I that I do or I have been doing that uh seem to help, you know
increase my uh, my pollen potential and success
um, so I just you know, I didn't know if anybody else is playing around with anything like that or if
um more and more people are getting into the into the
you know the reversal game so I just wanted to kind of like, you know, share some of my
My tips and and see if anybody had any suggestions or anything else that you know that I haven't really been thinking about but
uh
a couple things that I do
Reversal wise, uh, usually use, you know sts and stuff and I do you know, I get great results
I get you know, everything happening the way it's supposed to be but
One thing that i've that i've noticed that if I just kind of go as is and keep my plants
Under 12 hours of light. We're under a flowering period light system when they're over. Uh, you know
Overly ripe we're getting ready to drop pollen
Uh the female plants stay too too compact their flower clusters are really really close together
and they they lack the parts and
The little extra, you know the little extra to kind of push those flowers apart and and open up the flower so they can drop pollen
so
What i've been doing is i've been getting them into the reversal process and pushing them through making sure that they're good and
You know flipped and once they start to really start to put on nice clusters
I've been uh putting them back into veg, uh veg lighting system so that they kind of start stretching out
So towards the end of you know, their flower set when they're ready to start dropping pollen
They're kind of stretching out into a reveg state which separates those flower
Bud sites a lot better and allows me to gather more pollen and drop more pollen that way there's less pollen
loss
It kind of opens up each individual flower a little bit better
Uh, and i'm trying to work on you know, the timing of that to try to
Figure out when's the best exact time to throw it out there so that I can get the most stretched out of those flowers
Uh, but basically just by putting them back into like, you know, 16 18, you know, 20 hours of light I can
I can stretch out those flower clusters, you know
Exponentially and it's really helped help the game. Um, which is nice
also
About halfway through that period right when I decide to uh, you know flip them
I've also been trying if depending on the time of year or the setup
Is instead of getting them started inside with the with the with the silver sprays and once i'm good and ready
I'll go ahead and put them outside and let the let the sun finish them off and the sun
Is one of the better one of the better things that I've found for getting excess pollen to come out
just like any light or high pressure sodium or other things, but
You know, definitely the leds don't produce as much, you know pollen from from my
Perspective is like a high pressure sodium, but the sun actually does
A pretty damn good job. It's not the best that i've seen so far. So if I don't have the time a year ahead
Um, then i'm i'm, you know, i'm keeping them inside and i'm lengthening them into a veg cycle
Uh halfway through but if I have the the year ahead of me
Then i'll throw them outside and that sun really seems to get a little extra pollen to drop down. So
That's one of the things that i've been playing with a lot lately
And it's really, you know up my success
As well as like, you know not
Spraying them a little extra, you know, um, you can get them started
and
They might you know, they might look great. They might set nice flowers. They might be all perfect
Everything might be all the way ahead but right towards the end
and that stuff kind of starts to wear off a little bit or or something along those lines and
They don't make as much pollen or they kind of slow it down on the on the actual production phase or they have a harder
Time creating the pollen because they're not used to doing it or whatnot
But so so every every few days I I give them a little squirt
Uh, just to keep them flipped 100 of the way
So not only can I lengthen their light schedule a little bit stretch out those flowers
But I can also kind of give them a little bit extra
um
You know silver so that I can make sure they stay, you know, hormonally, you know flipped and are always on you know
Game's always on the prize
so I was just uh
you know i'm just seeing if anybody out there has ever played around with something like that or
If there's any other techniques that you know, anybody else has deployed or thought about deploying, you know
Okay, can you guys hear me
It's really really
It's muffled yeah, well shit
I have I wanted to talk about this but i'm kind of sitting i'm sitting here on a large
conveyor belt trimming weed, uh fresh
so
you know, it's like real world in action, but I I did i've been playing around with silver and
I I think everything is things interesting
The one the one thing that I was wondering
is if you're
Allowing the plant to reverse
Where it goes back into a vegetative state. Do you feel that would contribute?
to any hermaphroditism
in the progeny
Do you think at all like it would confuse the you know, like cause any hermaphroditism
So i've tried oh go ahead trees
No. Yeah. No, I'm just gonna say, you know just uh doing it with regular seed making
um and not the reversal but putting putting those uh
Seeded plants into veg into a veg cycle to kind of speed up the the ripening process of the seeds
uh the offspring
You know has never really been hermaphroditic prone in any of the lines that i've played with and I do know
that there are a lot of other breeders, you know out there, you know, like colin ethos and
Uh rasta jeff and a couple of cats like that that kind of do similar things
Uh were played around with similar things like that
And you know, it's just something that i've i've been i've been dabbling in but I have not seen an excess with that hormonal change
uh, all i've seen is uh, you know
benefit on that side, uh so far but
you know when we run them out in the thousand when they start getting that way then then we'll really get a
get a check numbers, but
See what tony has to say there
Well, i've done some of the same things myself. I've uh, i've used um
The 24 light schedule after i've pollinated
And i've also pollinated in a 24 light schedule when you have plants that will throw pre-flowers from being in the pots for too long
To make seeds with both of them work. It's a transient response in the plant from the
Endogenous hormone levels that we're trying to alter with the silver
so
From what I found I found no changes and the proof of nature for us is uh, auto flower plants, right?
They've been breeding this way
Your account of hermaphrodism in the progeny that come from even the wild eagle types of uh, the um,
Auto flower plants i've played with some of those from slovenia and such and I don't see any homophrodism in those
That are just straight auto flowers that aren't like the lions that are bred for like seed production oil production
But when I've done the pollination under 24 hours, i've never had any issues with anything coming up under those
um, it just
speeds up the metabolism of the plant the plant will start to
Produce, uh the seeds quicker for you
You can probably knock like 10 days off of the ripening of those seeds from you under 24 hours. Also
That's what i've found
Yeah from a genetic standpoint you shouldn't be actually altering the um
The genetics or
By putting them into a 24 hour light cycle you're just in changing the environment
you're not actually changing the underlying genes now if the
plants are already
Susceptible or predisposed towards herming based on
Changes in their light cycle then that's a genetic component that could be passed on to the plant
But that's a plant that you will typically
Like that's what you want to not breed with when you're doing reversals those plants that are
likely or
Susceptible towards herming based on environmental cues. So doing some stress testing and or only breeding with plants that
are not
Going to have that environmental response
is
You know best practices
Yeah using those ethylene sensitive plants is just going to end up
Passing that along in genetics that plant's telling you something when like if on day, let's say day, uh
47 the plant always starts to throw homorphidites in the room
That's why they used to make some of those products from certain nutrient companies that you could spray on your plant that were uh, ethylene
um either blockers or um
Will increase the amount of ethylene in the area so you can stop stamina flowers you can use uh things like um
Florel on your plants to do the same thing
It's some of the products that you can use on reversing males
Which is something I was going to ask trees about when he's going in the veg
What he's doing is altering the hormone, uh, the endogenous hormone levels of that plant
And it's increasing the amount of ethylene by going back into the uh veg state
So that plant starts to reduce the amount of obsessic acid and gibbereic acid it's producing
um
Have you tried spraying the ethafon?
On the reversed female to get the same response that you're getting by going into that 24 hour to get her to dump
uh pollen
in a uh 12 and 12 schedule or under a regular flower schedule since you can actually increase that with the different products
Yeah, i've never tried the ethafon or the florel or any of that funny stuff like that. No, man
Um not on females anyway, i've been doing a lot of funny male stuff that way but I never even thought about
You know squirting that female with with with the ethafon or anything like that. So
um
Yeah, that's interesting that opens up another little another little thing, you know, just to kind of play with mad scientist style. Um
But yeah, yeah. Yeah. Talk about that man. Talk about that
Well, I haven't actually got into doing it yet
It's something i've been starting to research into since I know that uh,
Ethylene can have the ability of causing the plants to ripen and that's the issue that we're having when that plant won't drop pollen on
Us the flower the stamina flower on the reversed female isn't ripening fully so she never opens all the way up
So i'm under the impression that there's a possibility of giving a very light misting one time
Right before she's about to drop that might cause those stamina flowers to fully open up
it's just
I wanted to try um
I just haven't got to try it yet this year
It's something that I was going to get into next year when it starts to warm up
um
I was also going to try uh, there's another product that a partner on instagram turned me on to it's called ethyl block
It's a product that can be used
Without spraying on the plant and be added to uh, say a small tent where you would put a single female
Or a couple females where you only wanted those plants to reverse no other plants that would be pollinated. It has the ability to
make plants
Produce stamina flowers. Um, the only person i've ever seen talk about it on cannabis is actually chimera
back in some posts on uh
Ic mag back in the day
Back, I think it was like 2013 this post go back to
Um, but yes the stank of a dank on instagram
He's the cat that brought it to my attention the other night on his live chat
It's I started doing some research of that and that's a product that you can actually use to reverse plants
And it would be something that you don't have to mix and spray onto the plant
It's something that you add to water
And put into a chamber with your plant and it off gases while the plant's in there. It's safe for humans. It's safe for animals
Um, it's just I wouldn't smoke the product but that they can actually off gas in the air and it would not hurt you
There's no re-entry time at all for it
So that's a new product that i've been trying to dive into and I was wondering if possibly using that in conjunction with sts
Would give us the ability to have a more efficient
Of reversal where she would actually drop pollen and do it on a quicker pace
Closer to how a actual female's flowering because we all know when we reverse that
That reversed female actually has a delayed time and reaction to going into flower and producing
The pollen that we're after compared to when she would normally go into flower period
I was looking into uh that uh, you know, the elite x elite the hybrid tech stuff
Uh to see if that was gonna speed up anything. I didn't know anything
Um, I haven't tried anything like that or done anything like that, but I was just
Anybody looked into that?
I used it this year
I've tried it myself
I've tried it with a side-by-side on mine just to see how plants would react
And the plant that I hit it with at the rate that it said my plant didn't like it
So I I I haven't ran another test to see if I should lower the levels
But when I sprayed it the same way I did with mine
The plant that I did spray she she's sensitive
So she didn't she did not like what was going on, but i've had that happen with mine also
So it could have just been that reaction heat temperature, uh anything
But uh hybrid tech stuff is killer he's that's where I got the original
Uh information back in the day man back on the high c mag
So just quickly, uh
lucas welcome to the stage and uh, johnny, I just uh,
If you have a question or comment, uh, go for it
Hey everybody. Um, I just thought i'd bring up a
something you guys might find interesting as far as um,
a product that might be
uh worth experimenting with as far as um,
Kind of that I think switch is one of the names of the products that has like an ethylene
Uh, it produces ethylene or sends ethylene to the plants to reverse kind of uh intersex traits
Um, so that's kind of the concept of there's like this lack of ethylene when things are starting to show hermaphrodism
a lot of times
and an interesting option that people might um,
You know find useful is
um a fermented fruit juice
Um, those are extremely high in ethylene as you guys know. It's a ripening agent
Um, and if you get really right plants and you ferment them there is high amounts of ethylene in that concentrate
Concentrated in that solution. So it might be a natural
um route to go that's way
Cheaper and it's something that's uh overall like a way
You know safer to handle. Um input that you can use to try to
To reduce the chance of intersecting flowers showing up
Yeah, that's that product I was trying to remember the name of um the active ingredient and that is actually the same thing that's in
Florel it's called ethyphan. So it's just at a lower um strength in that
Again, I can't remember what uh, johnny called it, but it's which I believe switch. There's another product also
They used to be uh sold
They don't sell it here any longer california. I don't believe but both of them were um ethylene
Um products that once sprayed on the plant would offer gas ethylene
So like I said, if you had a plant you knew through stamina flowers a day 57
Day 10 you'd spray that plant
It would increase the amount of ethylene and the ratio to ethylene the triple acid in the receptor
Would cause that stamina flower never to show up so you'd end up with plants that basically
never through that uh homoerphrodite out there so you were able to
chemically and hormonally block the uh
Genetic coding that was happening since that plant naturally wanted to be a morphedite
There's plants out there that will no matter what gonna throw
Those uh staminodes at specific times i've seen it many times
And I want to say what's up to lucas my brother nice to see you on here man
And you got to unmute yourself lucas
What's going on
Can you hear me
Yeah, yes we can
awesome
Yeah, I figured I just got home from work figured I'd jump on and listen to what y'all are chatting about
And actually ryan just jumped on uh, I think he missed the part where you were talking about him earlier tony
But what did you say he uh?
Put up on an I I don't know if his ig or in one of the old forums or something
Yeah, it's an old ig forum that someone was talking about using different products for reversing females and one of them was uh, one methyl
Cyclopropene that uh is sold under the name ethyl block and I believe he said he had used different ethylene
products uh
For reversing plants and that was when he said he had used he's the only person i've ever come across that
Had mentioned using that product for any type of reversals on females and it's just something I was diving into from
information brought to my attention the other night
Yeah, I played around with a few of them back in the day just to see what was working if any was
better than another
Ethafon is also a really interesting one too. You think someone was just mentioning that
Um, yeah for reversing males, yeah exactly for for doing that gene capture on the males
It's again, you know
I kind of feel like when you're doing these breeding programs that you're if you're dropping pollen or if pollen is flying anyway
It's kind of like rebel grown. Dan was saying a couple weeks ago. It's like you want to
You know if you're if you're doing a sib cross female to a female like a sister sibling, for example
You probably want to throw in a copy of the plant
That is the pollen donor anyway, and then if you got it, you know
If you have like either either of the parents that made up that plant
I always like to do the back crosses at the same time, too
Just because you may as well right like the plant is already flying
so I kind of try to apply that same thing when you're if you are doing like a gene capture with
An open pollination or it's you know, even if you're using a single male
You may as well
Also just take a copy of that male plant and reverse it with
Ethel fawn
Or florel is the brand name often you can find it under
and
Yeah, because then like I said, then you've got that extra population and why not? What does it cost you like a clone?
Right a couple of transplants. It's really not that big a deal, but it opens up a whole
Line of possibilities now that you've got that set of seed, right?
So what kind of price point do those products have and uh, how uh shelf stable are they and like, you know
What type of uh time frame are they viable for?
I don't actually know
Is right now they they sell epiphone down here at my hydro shop. It's 49 for a quart
and a quarter of that stuff's going to last you a long time with cannabis because
Basically, they're they like the apple farmers out here will be using that stuff to help them with uh,
Ripening fruit that they have in storage that they picked early. It's used to spray on fruit. It's uh safer
Just off gases as ethylene. It helps with the ethylene binder sites in the plant with females a female
What was going to produce more ethylene than a male? That's why in cannabis
you're going to see
either a female or a male or what appears as like a
Dual sex when you get
Feminized seeds that shows a male
For me, that's the probably just a female that's got a high propensity to have ethylene issues. She's very ethylene sensitive
So anytime that ethylene ratio gets below a specific
Uh ratio, she automatically will start to throw out stamina flowers or might even do that from the beginning
even though she's
She's a girl
And you use these kind of products to uh alter that kind of stuff
But it's it's for regular fruit farmers out there. Therese probably knows a lot more about using ethylene for
ripening
Yeah, the ethylene the ethafond is pretty cheap
So if you got there by a quarter that stuff that's gonna last you a long time keep it in the refrigerator
um
I had i've had that stuff last me over five years and been able to use it and before I went
Got another model of it
Just because it was too damn old and I was figuring it's probably time to get a fresh one
Because I used it back in uh, 2000
And uh, I want to say 10 when I reversed my angel mail
When I got him tested
So once I did that I had to buy another bottle that stuff around 2015 or so. I was gonna do some other products
We used to sell that crap, uh the floral at the at the nursery, you know for years
I mean stuff would be sitting out there for forever that stuff as long as it's out of the sun and you know cared for
you know accordingly
Um, it'll last it'll last several years. I mean 2010 i'd probably replace it
But we used to use the floral or that that stuff for all the olive trees and stuff
Uh that set fruit and dropped it all over the the concrete and the patio or whatever
If you sprayed down the the olive trees when they were in bloom
um
It would stop the the fruit set so that's that's how that's how I started learning about it
And I always had a little bit of that in the truck
I started playing around with reversing mails and stuff. Now this this year finally i'm gonna get a
I'm gonna take the time and we're gonna run a bunch of you know
Reverse mail stock i'm gonna look at a bunch of that this year. So i'm excited about it
Yeah, that's awesome
Well, can you guys humor me i'm actually I feel like a nerd right now i'm actually really excited
Can you guys humor me and talk about reversing mails?
Because this is one thing that I have not dabbled in but i've been like really thinking about
And know nothing about it, but would love to know
What happens and you know what the purpose is?
Uh purpose for me would be that a male offers the x and y chromosome
so once reversed you have the possibility to inbreed a line or to
Go in one direction with one plant with a regular seed stock
Because of that fact that it's an x and y it's going to reverse basically the same as a female
But you're you're increasing the amount of ethylene on a male. So he'll show a pistol formation
Which is the opposite of what we're doing when we put silver on a female which blocks the ethylene
And increases the joy acid and obsessive gas ratio in the plant and then makes that plant produce a stamina
formation
So it's actually possible to reverse a male to produce pistols and then do the pistols ever?
Create what you will you ever get seeds on that plant?
You can get seeds. Uh, you can get very small buds for doing uh terpene and uh, cannabinoid analysis
Okay, you can use it for inbreeding
Yeah, 100. That's that's what I that's what I do a lot for was is to reverse the males
Um so that I can see, you know, their resin or their their true
Stain, oh, yeah
You get a seed stock
You get a seed stock and there's one seed that comes out of these old seeds and it's a male
And now you can use that ethafon to reverse that male to produce a small batch of seeds
That now can be back crossed to that original male or used to start to f-gen
Down the line from a single male instead of using a female
To produce a feminized seeds that now we have to outcross to something else to produce a male
With a male you can produce a seed line that will give you both male and females
So you're digging through these old seeds and only one pop and it was a male and you're like shit
What am I gonna do?
And now I have to cross it to all these other plants to try to find something close to what I was after
And now you can take that plant and cross it to its sibs
or do the half sibs or do the back crosses to the original line once you've made a uh,
a uh
Self f1 generation or actually it's an f2 coming out of that plant since that seed itself was basically an f1
And now you have the ability to start diving in trying to find what you're looking for from that single plant in a regular line
Yeah, um 707, uh
He's got some good
Examples of what it looks like when you reverse males
Up on his 707 seed bank if you look at his instagram
um
You have to go back a little ways
But there are a lot of really good pictures showing males that he's reversed
and I think he's got like
three or four different males that he's used in his breeding projects and he's reversed them all to
See what their expressions are and it's pretty cool because you can see it in the pictures that he's posted on ig
And if you want to do research on that dig into mohan ram there's a lot of information from mohan ran using ethafon
Uh to reverse males, uh back in the 80s, I believe it might even be
78 might be the earliest that i've read on the paperwork from mohan ram and said
uh, just type in uh
Reversal of males with ethafon and it should come up on your google. It's a good paperwork to read into
Yeah, you can get all of the old mohan ram papers, um
Now we've mentioned sci-hub, uh
A couple years ago. It was more difficult to get the mohan ram papers
It costs a little bit of money, but now you can definitely search them all out
And it was like a decade's worth of papers. They did
they
looked at the the effects of cobalt they looked at the effects of
gibberellic acid of a whole host of different
um
Exogenous hormones to try and get uh, different results in both male and female plants
And so there's a lot of literature out there and it's accessible now
When much more so than it used to be
And you mentioned cobalt
That's one reason I tell people when you're storing your seeds
Don't use a desiccant that has blue coloring on them because the coloring is there from a cobalt
That cobalt can be on your hands that can be
Ended up touching on your females the next thing, you know, you've got a girl that's ethylene sensitive and she starts producing
Staminodes in the flower room because you were fucking around with a wrong kind of desiccant
It just reminds me
That's a great point tony
Hey guys, if you're using the ethyl phone trick on females to um, sorry
On males to produce little pistolet flowers
just keep in mind that
Ethyl or sorry
Ethyl phone or will actually like spray an ethylene on the plant will actually change the endogenous levels
of the turps
So the finger the chemical fingerprint that you're the terpene fingerprint that you're going to get from the plant
Is not necessarily what it would naturally be
because it's being influenced by
The exogenous ethylene application that you're putting on the plant
so, uh
I mean it's an interesting clue, but I wouldn't call it like somebody called it the
The the natural female state of that plant. I definitely would not go that far
Um, just be aware that ethylene because they've done all this this on all these different flower species
And when you spray ethylene on it or ethanol specifically on other
Flower species it totally changes the terpene profile. So something to keep in mind
Very good
That's interesting that you say that I think it goes back to the saying just because you can do some things doesn't mean that you
should always
What's kind of like rubbing the stem to try to see if that's a terpene profile you're going to get in the finished
Flowers of the females that you're selecting through we all know that once she goes through the juvenile stage and into flower
Even from the beginning of flower bud set to mid flower. There's a complete different terpene swing of the plant
She's going to start to produce all kinds of new esters and thiols that are going to come out of the plant just based on age
From trichome development. This is also a reason i'm always telling people that you're 72 hours at the end of the flower period isn't producing
usable
Cannabinoids or terpenes out of a trichome that you believe you produced in 72 hours because it takes time for
These chemicals to be produced in that actual trichome heads. That's why
On day five she's a complete different beast than she is at day 72 or so. Yeah, judy booth
If you look up judy booth online
She's done a bunch of work on the terpene synthases and can and cannabis at ubc
And they actually did this kind of work where they they were like
individually
sampling like
like trichome glands of a specific size or
Developmental state like the number of days in and they showed exactly what you're saying tony but the that like different
Even even if you looked at the terpene profiles like forget all the esters and all the other stuff
Which you're totally true, which you're totally right to say even just terps within
Different trichomes of different ages. There's variation in the profiles within
So yeah
It's just knowing the limitations really of what we're doing right like i'm not saying don't spray it
Uh, don't spray males to see what they might
smell like when they're a female
It's just again. It's like a general clue. I wouldn't say that it's like
100 conclusive just you know, what's like with all these techniques? It's just we got to realize the limitations of what we're doing
um
I know this can be
People like to talk about things especially when they're speculating on maybe on some more advanced shit
They've never done and then that turns into these wild fucking theories on the forums or you know getting passed around ig
Just kind of just to try to keep it like in check a little bit, you know
it's um
It's not perfect. It's not a perfect sampling method. It's an interesting little trick
but again, I wouldn't be
Replacing that for you know, testing a female female out with a gcf id or something like that
No, but that seed stock once ran we'll start to give you ideas of what's in that gene pool
What you'll see out of that plant, especially if you just have that one male if you to work with
Absolutely. No, that's a totally different thing. Like I didn't mean to
I wasn't commenting on the s1 of the of a male plant and you're totally right
I mean what you're saying about you essentially get to shuffle the autosomes
Meanwhile the x and the y are kind of doing their little dance dance back and forth
So you can get either the male phenotype or the female phenotype
the other thing that allows you to do is
make
Like you said males and females of plants with only those two genomes that make up that individual male plant, right?
You're not again. You're not introducing a third or potentially fourth genome
By crossing it like by doing an outcross before you're you're inbreeding it, right?
It allows you to do that ultimate form of inbreeding
Where you're shuffling the chromosomes that are in that one plant
And kind of seeing what comes out
um, so I think it's a very valuable technique, you know, it's uh
Again, we don't have enough real ways in cannabis to do these type inbreeding things and it can be negative over multiple generations
if you do that, but
sometimes you do want to do a quick inbreeding step to see if you can find a homozygous condition or see what the
difference is between the heterozygous
Condition and the two different homozygous conditions for any given trait. So it's a very valuable tool
Yes, sir, I wish more breeders out here that
Are trying to play with this plant on any level would uh, actually practice it and try it find out
What the plants that they're using in their breeding projects?
Do well, how do they react to these?
endogenous hormone
alterations that we're putting on them or actually
we're just
using
endogenous plant hormone levels to uh
affect the phenotypical expression of these plants, which is a
visual way for us to understand that a plant can
Can
throw homorphodite expressions for any reason in a room from different, uh levels of
gases in the air say you're using fossil fuels to make co2 in there and the
Propane doesn't burn completely. It will increase the amount of ethylene that's in your garden
If you are trying to breed in that room and you have a male near that source
now there's a possibility that that male now can start to show a
Pistolet formation and you might decide to throw that plant out now because you think it's a homorphodite when in reality you altered
the uh
ethylene set receptors in the plant from uh unburned propane
those old school, uh underground growers pumping in uh
Propane with uh heaters gas burners would used to have a lot of issues with that trying to breed and shit. That's one
I dove into uh, finding that shit out from my own
Yeah, I mean
I'm kind of going to do a little bit of a different way with it
Like I kind of think that like again, like I was saying if you're flying pollen of a type anyway
It's like in my opinion, it's always a good idea to have that same genotype or that same plant
Reversed or at least of the opposite sex condition. So if you've got like for example, if you got a male plant you're
You're using for pollen, you know
I'll take a female or a male a copy of that male plant spray it with ethithon and have it in the room to collect
The pollen as well, right when you're making that out cross
You may as well get the self and same thing with a reversal with a female
Have you got a female plant that you're reversing to produce pollen?
I always put a copy of that plant in the room
as a female just so again, you can get the self cross right because
It it kind of puts like a calibration scale like say say you got like your male X whatever
It could be any plant but say you're crossing it to sour D
When you grow out the offspring of that like X to sour D that X to sour D cross
It's it's hard to say how much of the variation came from the heterozygosity found in the sour diesel mom
Versus the heterozygosity found in your right in that plant X
But if you've made the self cross of X whenever you're flying the pollen you can grow like 20 or 50
of the of the X s ones right the selves from that plant
alongside your hybrid and
It kind of gives you a way to look at like how much of the variation came from that plant we call X
right
So again, like while it might may not be like super
Useful for the breeding program that you're trying to do with X cross sour diesel
It kind of teaches you something at least about that one genetic input so then you can
You know based on that measure or at least estimate like the degree of heritability of the traits from the sour diesel
so I
Think else s ones are like again. We either from male plants or from female plants. It's always good
It's always a good thing to have that plant in there and make those selves if you can because again
This is like it's free information that you don't really have to do that much extra work for right
And maybe you're actually even you know it's a good step down towards a true breeding line from that plant
So I think it's worth doing I
Got a question for you Ryan
The old DJ short you know tactic about the males that throw a little pistol here
They're being like ethylene dominant males and breeding more females or better females
And never really bought into anything like that, but I was just wondering what what you know you have any thoughts on that
Yeah, well again. It's like there's a
It's a plausible scientific explanation. There's no data at all to support that that's actually what happened right so
again, it's one of those traits like
That
Could be a genetic switch
And we're looking at it like it's a chemical switch like it's an ethylene or a hormone switch
And there's no way from just looking at the plant
there's absolutely no way that you can determine either or right like the only way to do that would be to
To have a system set up for actually measuring ethylene
In a population of those plants and then see if that those actual ethylene measurements were tied to
That were actually correlated to the phenotypic expression, right? It's kind of again
it's like we've been done a lot of this shit over the last 30 years or 50 years even because
We've all been growing in closets or most people have and we're trying to make sense out of the things that we see
But I think we really haven't applied the proper scientific rigors to a lot of our conclusions
And so you still hear like all sorts of things like that
That's a good example of you know, these things that are kind of passed around the breeder community
through these grow books or whatever, you know online forums and stuff and
There's all these things that are passed around as if it's like just dogma truth, but I don't think that there's any real
It's like you said like what is there to back it up, right? So
What I when I hear about it, but when I think about that it's like yeah sure that's maybe it's a potential
Scientific explanation for what it is, but there's still no evidence to suggest that that's really actually what it is, right?
So that's kind of how I feel about it
That's what I think I was just just want to know your thoughts, it's awesome. Thanks
I've had a question. I
Reversed
Femmes and of reverse regs and then also clone only so has anybody noticed
I
Possibly femmes and clone only is not wanting to release pollen in that way we use ethylene to try to
extract more pollen out of those compared to
I've reversed my lime breath reserve
Regular seed stock and it reversed just fine, but I did a garlic sherbert
That was really not wanting to drop any pollen as anyone else kind of noticed that
Yeah, you're you're confusing two traits that so that you know
We have this thing that is kind of repeated over and over again in science that correlation is not causation
Right. So just because you saw that the plant from the feminized seed line or the guy notion seed line didn't drop pollen
That doesn't mean that it's associated with
Anything to do with that being a gun or a guy notion sir an all-female seed line
it probably has more to do with the genetic structure of the plants or how like I've the correlation that I seem to have noticed with
It is it's like the density of the female flower if you've got like a female flower that is incredibly dense and like
Especially those real kind of Afghanica, you know, the real old-school fat leaves with the plants that really don't stretch very much
That when those things reverse
The it's still a phenotypically looks like a pistol at plant it's just that those pistols are replaced with
Stamina flowers. Whereas if you look at like an actual stamina like a male in full fluorescence
The the individual flowers aren't all compact together like in a bud formation in that same way
they're kind of like they're kind of more spread out along the stem and
If you actually look at the you know what they kind of look like these individual grapes
Growing like upside down when the flower cluster start
But you know like call it say three four or five weeks into a like a true male flowering plant
Those clusters have grown a little
like a little stem at the base of the male flower and that flops down and it allows the
that like
That inverted kind of cluster of grapes to kind of dangle on that one stem and
If you actually get a bit Mel Frank taught me this when you actually look at the male flower
Like what way when it goes into flowering?
Like it almost folds back 180 degrees and really leaves the those little banana structures dangling in the wind
And those little banana structures if you look at them real close up, they they kind of like they're like little sails
They have they're not
They've got these little scoops in them and the scoops in them are designed to catch the wind because the wind when the wind blows
It shakes that whole banana structure. It just drops a shitload of pollen
Sorry
I'm literally looking at a male plant that I'm collecting actively collecting pollen from them totally see what you're saying
Yeah, so if you look at like if you now go and look at a female plant that's been reversed
They don't do that, right and it's more to do with it's more to do with the morphology of the flower
Than anything else like yeah, you still have those little bananas in there
But because it still has the female cluster like that set of female clusters
Sorry, like that female bud like that female Cola shape
It stops the male flowers from like opening up and dropping and so structurally
They're actually not the same as a male plant
Yeah, sure
Like the morphology of the individual flower it's got all the right parts in there
But it's just something to do with the way that they're stacked in this Cola
But they don't seem to drop and I'm not saying that this is like a hundred percent of the problem
This is just like part of the thing that contributes to the problem. So
one thing you can do on those plants is spray them with a little bit of
Gibberellic acid we also know the gibberellins
Will in will cause reversal right on female plants, but it also makes them stretch like shit
Right because gibberellin is the hormone that controls plant height when you knock out gibberellins or gibberellin receptors and plants
That's when you get that dwarf phenotype
That they use in other plants, but you can you know in breeding other crop plants, but that's one way to deal with it
Yeah
That particle it's called the filament that connects the stamina male flower to the node of the plant there
see that's something I've postulated so many times at that part not being produced by the
female is
part of the reason why we're having issues with the stamina flower actually dropping down from the weight of the filled up sepals and
Then we don't get any of the pollen that we're actually after because she doesn't actually have this morphology on herself
And again, I was thinking the same thing by using ga3 and either
Combined with some ethylene to make that plant start to produce an elongated cell structure, which would increase
node spacing which now gives us a
ability to have a more open flower structure which
Increases the amount of pollen that we could possibly get from that plant
So we don't have to manually go in there and remove flowers like I've had to show people
To do and then manually dry the flower and then crush that which can now
distort the pollen grain which has issues with going down the pollen tube
which all can affect that how
Effective pollen is receptive by the female plant. I've also read of some breeders throwing
when the reverse female is about halfway done throwing it back into the vegetative chamber to kind of
allow it to naturally stretch out and
You know give you some space and so that the stamina clusters are not so densely packed together
That's the thing that I was talking about doing with like, you know
The Mac and the other things getting it rolling down the hill and throwing it back in the veg
Or just increasing the light schedule a little bit 14 16, you know even 18 hours
to try to stretch it out and seems
Seems seems to work with a lot of things that I've done it with pretty you know
Pretty well at least gives you a little bit of space, you know
Depending on when you put it out and how how you do it, but that's what that's what I was talking about earlier
The trials and tribulations asking if anybody had played around with that
So so what I'm hearing at this interesting because
when I've done some breeding and I've talked to other people doing it they you know mentioned that it's
specific to genetics like different plants
genetics of different plants will
Sometimes drop more more pollen than others like certain plants are more prone to dropping pollen
But it seems like you guys are actually
postulating or suggesting that it's more related to the structure of
itself
Then it is potentially like difference between genetics or that maybe it's the genetics
that are
allowing the growth
You know the the flower set the structure of the flower set, you know
that's
More related to the structure of the flower set. It's causing increased pollen
Versus the genetics of the plant itself when you go through a reversal. Is that what I'm hearing?
What genetics flower structure is genetics like to me you're talking about the same thing
It's one of those things where like the chemistry of the plant
the structure of the plant is a reflection of what's in the genome the genome is the expression is the
The genome is the recipe for that expression. The phenotype is the expression of that rest. Yeah
Yeah, I think I was the autism kicking in. I don't think I did a great job of
Elucidating what I was trying to like get out like I guess what I'm saying is that you're suggesting that it's more
regarding the the
the inability
Like to produce yellow the inability of a reverse plant to produce pollen is more related to how dense the flowers
are versus like
Something between different genetics like a plant. I guess it's interrelated I guess but
Yeah, well, yeah, well the plant just produced less
Yeah, because you can't get it out, you know, you can't get the pollen is the flower cluster so dense
So, you know, even if it was producing a ton of pollen, you know, so a lot of it's gonna get trapped
To build a pass it or stretching them out in some way would help some plants
Don't like to drop as much pollen as easy as other plants, you know
So I think it's combination of those I've been thinking the whole time about this idea with the fermented plant juice
I think it's really an interesting idea to
Experiment with ferment fermented plant juice and some of this stuff. I think that'll be really interesting
experiment add some heavy amino acids at flip along with those plant juices to help increase that
That happening. I've seen a lot of heavy amino acids
applications that flip cause some
Stamina and flower formations on the plant when done
But usually I just stick with a
Blocker of ethylene if you can block that ethylene she's gonna show stamina flowers
that's the easiest way a lot of people are just afraid of using it because
They're afraid it's not organic enough or something. We're just altering
Endogenous hormone on that plant and just think of it like this if you grew some cannabis by an old silver mine you could
Technically end up with plants that showed as males
Just based on the amount of silver in the soil
So it's not that bad using the silver to reverse your plants. It's actually the most efficient way
I've found so far doing it on a smaller scale. Oh
Man, those organic hippies. They'll drink clothes colloidal silver all day. So
Just call yourself
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah, I don't know I mean to me it was like you said earlier it was like you're saying like
difference between female plant or a feminized plant or a clone only or regular seed is like that can only can't that clone only came
from somewhere right it came from either a
female female breeding or it came from a regular seed at one point in time, so
But again, I just don't think that you know
We've really in the last 20 years or so since the feminized breeding is really kind of taken off maybe 25 years
We've been pretty
Like willing to blame the technique for any negative trait that comes out of the cross
But I think in a lot of cases
In almost all cases I should say it has to do with the pairing up of the genes that are coming together and not the
method
Right that we're using to make those seeds and especially with self. I mean again, we've got this
We're gonna say it again. We've got this obligate out crossing species. That's got all this genetic variation
It's like very expected when we start breeding it in selfing plants
that we're gonna get a certain amount of plants that are gonna start showing up with all these weird traits that are
the result of like
You know loss of function genes that have been buried in the in the genome that we just don't normally see when we're crossing
When we're out crossing right but when you're selfing a plant, I mean, it's the most it's the most severe form of inbreeding
Really 25% of the plants are gonna be or 50% of the plants are gonna be homozygous coming out of any
Trait that's heterozygous in the South Cross, right? So
We're uncovering a lot of
Recessive traits when we self because the we've cannabis has a lot of them buried in there
And that's you know, that's just something to be aware of when we're selfing is like again
It is the most severe form of inbreeding cannabis can do
So we should expect that we're gonna have some inbred plants in there
But part of it is like using those plants and developing inbred lines from them
Because then when we when we've done that and stabilized a whole bunch of these traits when we bring those lines back together
that's what we're gonna start seeing the real hybrid vigor or heterosis, right which is
Something that we've kind of lost in the last like 20 years because everything is just a poly hybrid at this point in time, right?
So we don't really see true true hybrid vigor anymore
And by the way, if anyone from the audience has any questions or comments, just raise your hand. I
Think everyone's sitting at Ryan's feet Indian style right now
I
Kind of come like in the middle of this fresh frozen craziness
Colloidal silver did you guys talk about colloidal silver?
Has anyone used it? I have a buddy that does it but he's just like you have to spray it every day for like
forever
So, you know, it's a waste
He's in the past the problem with colloidal silver is the size of the ions that you create are usually too large to
Penetrate into the receptor of the plant. That's why it becomes so ineffective and it's a burning the shit out of your plant
Silver thiosulfate works so better is the
the actual size of that ion is much smaller and it has a
Has a much more effective
Outcome on the receptor of the plant when you actually spray so you don't spray as much just spray a very
Well, I know just as lower level period so you end up using less product it's cheaper
You know, yeah, that's just the way to go I used the
Elite was it hybrid elite this year. I
Used it pretty good results
I did feel like I use on a few different projects and by the time I got to the end
I was I had to reapply it one time after you know, just to kind of
Continue a the continuation of the reversal process, but like it was more successful that way
Silver does work. I mean, I don't use it, but I know there's a girl up here selling it and do a couple of different provinces
Like
She's just got a cheap silver generator that she makes, you know, just plugging in a
Like one of those kind of little whatever they're called like a little 9-volt whips essentially used to
Does work like it does work but you're right you got a spray the shit little time
I think the SDS is just for the cost
It makes so much more sense to use that because it's like it doesn't beat the shit out of the plant in the same way
You can't do it that way if you've got no access to the chemicals because a lot of people can find a silver coin, right?
Get a silver coin and a couple alligator clips and one of those
9-volt charger things. I mean you're pretty much off to the races, but
Yeah, I don't think it's the most ideal ideal version
Just speaking on colloidal silver down here in Aotearoa, New Zealand
We do have nano particulate colloidal silver which does work a treat and you are right
We do have to spray it on every day, but it definitely does pop those males out
So confirmation from down in New Zealand and nano particulate colloidal silver will actually work
Yeah, the picture that you know on this profile right here you guys probably see that's a that's Kev's pure kush
reverse, you know SDS
You know sprayed every couple days and that thing drop it dumped a bunch of pollen, you know, great great little play right there
But yeah, I didn't beat the plan up. I mean, yeah, you don't got to spray it every day SDS the way to go for sure. I
Did hi everybody London here I did
Colloidal silver and you can look at my photo here. And yeah, you do it every day
I find that as long as you don't go like super high in ppm a lot of people when they get colloidal silver
They'll go like a hundred ppm or something like that
I think it's just expensive and it's between the time that it takes to spray them and then
The cost of the product because I mean even if you buy it over the counter
It's quite expensive and because you have to spray them every single day
Ideally twice a day if you have like a 40 pp p ppm
One works. Well, then you don't get as much burning but you have to hit them twice a day
Which is great for someone like me who is in a small space doing digital work most of the day and I'm by my grow
So it's like oh, it's not a problem, you know twice a day
Oh, I do it this afternoon, but I think in a large scale would just be a way way way too expensive and be
too time-consuming
With colloidal silver also you got to understand how it was produced. Was it produced at what voltage?
Depending on the voltage you could have a larger or smaller size of the particle
Which is what's making it less effective on your plant?
That's why you might have to be spraying it more often
You could have two colloidal silvers that are both testing at 40 parts per million
But they don't have the same size ions in the solution suspended in there. So that's
the colloidal silver not to be as effective when
You use one batch from one company compared to another company or when you make it yourself when you build a generator for
You need to use 27 volts if you're gonna run that
usually you should most people run a three batteries when they make colloidal silver gets yourself a
little power generator that you can switch over to up to 27 volts and
Use that if you're gonna make your own colloidal silver
but again, it's much cheaper to just buy the
chemicals for colloidal or for STS over thiosulfate silver nitrate and
Silver thiosulfate you buy those to make some together and that's gonna last you guys for forever
You're never gonna run out once you buy that product. It's gonna cost you about
40 bucks for
the two chemicals that you need and
Basically could reverse every cannabis plant that you're gonna come across if you're a hobby grower
And I have a real easy recipe that is always stuck in my head even though I don't really you guys know how I feel
about feminized but personally but anyways the dissolve 100 grams of prismatic sodium thiosulfate
Penhydrate or 63 grams of an hydrous thiosulfate in 500 milliliters of water
Then you would dissolve 17 grams of silver nitrate and another 500 milliliters of water
Then you would mix the silver nitrate solution into the sodium thiosulfate solution
Which you would use 10 milliliters
the concentrated STS solution in each liter of water to achieve a concentration of
108 parts per million silver which is
equivalent to
132 parts per million on the STS
And did you mean 17 grams or 1.7 grams on that?
17 grams
If you only use 10 milliliters per liter that's where it was made up so yeah
It's the same thing
Yeah, that comes from I want to say read and stabby from
Yeah, I use it myself I use a nine-to-one ratio which might comes out to at the very end I
Will say I've used Tony's recipe and I did have a plant just catch a little bit of over spray from another plant that
I was spraying and it flipped and started reversing with zero issues. So
It's definitely pretty potent even though it seems a little bit more diluted
Yeah, you've I think you've used that and Hardy also is using my recipe that I've shared and it's not my recipe
Like I said, it's a recipe that I found back in the day on the forums that I protect had shared back in
man
I want to say
And that's a hell of a memory you got there
That's if you like for me to remember something like that, I need to like do it on a regular basis
But like if you just memorize
No, that's me brother. The stuff that goes in my head doesn't want to come out. I don't know why I wish some of it would leave
I got a step out to do the book cup guys
Thank you for letting me hang out with you on stage up. You're still going afterwards
I'll be back after after that show, but appreciate it. Thank you all
I guess
I was just gonna say we'll just take a chance to go ahead and reset the room
And to invite I guess was that Christ up and did you have a question or did you have something you wanted to say or contribute?
Oh
I just seen Chad Westport in the chat on YouTube asking about whether or not you get all feminine seeds from a
Female or why the male?
Gives you both and I just wanted to tell him that yeah that I had mentioned that on his show and we have brought it
up tonight
females carry
Only X chromosomes and the male carries a X and a Y chromosome. So it's easy to remember no why no guy
So when you reverse a female you're getting female seeds and when you reverse a male
You're getting a female and male seeds and you're gonna end up with that whole population of that genotype that you create
You could find plants that have ethylene
sensitivities or be extremely
Reliable to ethylene swings
so that's where you're gonna see her morphed ism in the seeds that you produce from those plants where you may think you found a
Homophrodite line or a male and female seeds
There's a possibility that you're just seeing a plant that's highly sensitive to endogenous hormone swings without doing a
Chromosome test on that there's no way to tell if what you have is actually a boy or a girl
Even if you breed with it, right you could have a male that pops out of a fem population
That's gonna produce seeds for you
Till you find that project and find out what comes out of those there's no way to tell but just looking at it
That's that posted some paperwork on that just the other day that I haven't went all the way through also identifying plants through morphology and
the seedling stages finding females males and homophrodites by plant structure how
Quickly parts of the plan are growing the length of particular parts of the morphology that is producing
I have not read the whole paper yet, so I'm not sure what it
Conclusion comes to yet, though
Christ did you have anything that you wanted to say or did you have a question?
Yes
Good afternoon again family. No, it's just
Confirming that colloidal silver does work pump out daily
But yeah, it's just having making sure that you're purchasing the nano particulate as was referenced
The size of the silver obviously activates differently
So yeah, we do get from the whole foods shop nano particulate colloidal silver, although it is expensive
Some of us can't get silver nitrate. So it works
Yeah, I never even thought about the fact that depending on what country you're in
having accessibilities to different
chemicals and substances are going to be
Problematic that we kind of take for granted and some parts of the world
Peter Tony
Is there any questions that anyone has from the chat on YouTube?
I'm not looking at any of the questions, but I'm just wondering
Looking at any of that
Gravy do you have a question or comment?
Yeah, I just had a quick question. My comment is y'all are wonderful and thank you very much for having this forum
Honored to just even be able to ask a question
But I was just wondering if the reversed males or the reverse females have been looked at for medicinal purposes
I understand it's used for breeding traits and you guys are doing wonderful things
Making different lines and inbred lines and back crosses and stuff
But I just was wondering if you can get a female to throw male pollen
Have they done any studies on that for medicinal value? And if you can get a male to reverse and make female flowers
Have they done any testing with those flowers to see?
What type of terpenes they had and what type of medical use they could be used for that was my question and I'm complete
On males, I I did test my male for cannabinoids, but not for terpenes when I did test him
I wanted to know what he would come out my he did test for
11.54% THC when I had him tested when I reversed him besides that I didn't
Run anything through any medicinal tests. He did not produce large enough flowers for me to be passing any herb to anybody
Smoke I basically just wanted to find out if he had the ability to produce
Any form of cannabinoids or any novel ones would show up when I did reversal?
Yeah, and I thought that was pretty cool
I just figured if somebody in a commercial grow actually had the square footage to be able to pump out more male flowers
So it was pollen sacks, but then you reverse it and then it makes flowers and then all of a sudden you're like
What do you know it cures cancer?
What do you know? It does something for arthritis. I mean, I just was wondering if people were actually
Diving into it to see if there was actual medical
Uses for a male pushing female flowers or vice versa
Well, thanks for your time today guys, I gotta get going my wife just got home and my baby was crying to set off
So, um, love you all much respect. Thank you so much for your time
Thanks for hopping on gravy
So Trevor just quickly back on
The the hatch plant topic since you're back home now, right?
Yes
Were there any kind of cultivars that it didn't cross well with
Yeah
Purple oracle s ones it did not make good crosses with that
They came out with jack turps, which was a big disappointment
They were also pretty susceptible to mold
purple oracle if anybody's ever grown it is a
pretty mildew susceptible plant and
Mixing it with the 88 hash plant did not help it in any way in that regard
and for whatever reason the turf profiles that came out ranged from
Kind of a jagu kind of terpine Eileen
What I like to call fancy Jack
To just straight
Jack turps, I don't know where the terpine Eileen came from in the cross because none of the
plants expressed very high terpine Eileen in the
In the parents, but in the offspring it definitely came out. And so
That one was a no-go
Otherwise
There's like, you know certainly preference
Things like certain people don't like the bud structure that the 88 produces particularly outdoors
It can pass on a little bit of leafiness to the progeny. So you'll end up with very large nugs with very
Very difficult to trim leafy nugs on some of them
that's typically only a subset of any population in the hybrids because you'll get your like
Your plants that lean much more towards the parent there will be some
Intermediary or the mother parent there will be some intermediary
Phenos in between the two and then you'll get your very intense
88 hash plant leaners and like I said before it doesn't produce the best outdoor nugs structure
It's much more of an indoor producer. It
Produces a lot larger calyx. It gets way frostier indoors and
Has better bag appeal generally speaking
So that's definitely something to keep in mind with the crosses that even with like
Even in the the crosses that are really nice like I've been smoking a lot of the
Pina f4 hash plant crosses lately and they produce a really nice sort of floral honey
Pina sort of turf that is really
really pleasant and enjoyable and you can kind of you can pick out the hash plant leaners and you can pick out the
Leaners and you can pick out the pina leaners and the pina leaners will be more floral more honey and the
The hash plant leaners will be a little bit more accurate. They'll have a bit more of a
meatiness to them almost and so
that's
It's definitely, you know
Some of the range of variation that you'll see in the populations
Yeah, I've used that 88 g13 line of some breeding myself and I found a lot of the same qualities that you're bringing up there brother
She for me she didn't pair well for the God's gift line that I had
But she did pair well with my space cush and the Girl Scout cookies when I
Crossed her to that. I'm a Girl Scout. She made
Much much more larger buds, man. They were huge compared to the Girl Scout side. They started to stack
Outside they started to stack she was running Cola's almost three feet long
The flavor profile was closer to that 88 g13 hash plant where it's that meatier
Earthy side with a little bit of accurate Kim
terpene profile
That lines nice for breeding with for sure
The way you're describing
Reminds me a lot of the oil spill that I got from aficionado. It grows a lot like that as well
but it's more like
has a very metallic kind of blood you know, you almost smell like keys and change and
a little bit of lemon hints in there, but it grows very similar to how you're explaining that hash plant
That's funny that's one of the one of the things we crossed with it
I'm trying to find a picture that 88 g13 and flower so I can show the structure that Trevor's talking about
Exactly what the she does have a higher leaf to calyx ratio than a lot of lines people might select for
But the breeding potential that line is awesome and the tricone
Coverage that she brings to the crosses that she's added to I believe is a direct
Correlation to that bud structure. She's bringing something across to plants that you want to have a higher hash production
That's why that 88 g13
Basically a hash plant, you know, she breeds that quality hundred percent
And being a hash plant does she does the resin on her?
Is it very like sandy like or you get greasiness out of her? What kind of?
Trichome, I guess feel are you getting from her?
On the 88s themselves, you'll get a lot more of the greasy so they don't
They're difficult to do for solventless and for live resin, but you're gonna get with the out crosses like we made
GMO hash plant crosses and
What's really nice is there's some just full-on dead ringers for the GMO, but it reduces the flowering time significantly
so instead of dealing with something that can go anywhere from
70 to 120 days and flower you're dealing with a regular flowering time
eight to ten weeks and
You've got that same sandy
Granular kind of trichome that are
Gland that you're getting with the GMO and you'll also get those gnarly sort of garlic GMO turps
we also did the the dirty D the variegated chem D and
those same thing where
You process them or work with them you end up with this tacky resin and then on top of it
it's almost like you look at your the finger hash and it'll have this like
coating of white on top of the
The finger hash that you've sort of like, you know smashed into your fingers and it'll feel real sandy and granular
and so
It's one of those things where the 88 hash plant has more of a greasy resin
It's trichome coverage
I've seen it. I've seen
indoors
Phenos that rival, you know Mac type frostiness or the white type frostiness where it's just complete coverage
totally frosted out and
From what I've experienced the 88 is more greasy, but when you cross it with other things that have more of that sandy
Cuticle that's something that you can pass on into the offspring and those ones are the ones that well
I haven't gotten well, that's not true. We
We took samples from
the chem D hash plant, I think it was about 19 different plants that all got mixed together and
Sent to a wash and I believe it came back with a 3.4 percent
return and
So that's just like the bulk population mixed together and then washed
Then we also did
The pina hash plant didn't wash as well again, we think that's probably because of the greasiness in the in the
resin because it came back at 2.9 percent returns and
the osemine terpinaline sort of
Terp profile is it had been asked earlier what people thought was the
The cause of that and I think that it's largely a terp
There's a wax cuticle element to it. And then there's a terp element to it. I
was kind of wondering that because I've noticed a lot of
cultivars Iran that are extremely just smack you in your face full of terpenes are
Typically more greasy side
However, I have had like my black lime reserve actually mean jeans black lime reserve that I've ran and it's more of a sandy
textured tricone but
Still just knocks you out of this world with terpenes
so I've kind of wondered if it's
Genetic related if it has to do with the
cuticle
Kind of thickness of the tricone or what what that is really?
Yeah, it's definitely
You can see it when you cross these for instance the chem D in the 88g 13 hash plant
You'll see that there's something that are coming out with that really sandy granular sort of tricone head and then some that are coming
out with much more of a greasy easy to perforate sort of tricone and
Those ones are
to my mind
exhibiting that are
displayed by the 88 father
Whereas the ones that are more of the grain you know granular sandy ones are displaying the traits from the mother plant in the chem D
same thing with the
the GMO and some of these other varieties that have that are known for that sandy resin and so by selecting and
Crossing these and then seeing what the offspring is like and
Continuous continuing to do breeding programs that are selecting for these particular traits. We're going to be able to
improve much more
for
specifically going down and you know kind of developing what mean gene is developed in terms of
That waxy sort of sandy cuticles that actually can hold up to processing
But still has those just smack you in the face turps
Like that's the best of both worlds that you want to have you want to be able to have a cuticle that can withstand
the process while also
being able to
Have those loud turps inside of it that perforate the membrane
And I'm trying to put mr. Tip mr. Toad just sent me a
Couple
Photos that I'm gonna try to throw up on the YouTube but Lucas that what what cuz I just popped a bunch of
Line one Jaro from Jackson. What what from him?
Do you like playing with the most?
Because I think you had mentioned somewhere like people are like people are focused on X, but they're sleeping on Y
Well, it's funny that you just mentioned both of those
Everyone's so focused on root beer
You know and so all over that personally, I'm a huge OG fan I'm from Southern, California
so the sky
the sky Jaro is
Amazing like I've ran f1s of it probably about five years ago. I
Did a little bit of breeding with it and it was just some of my favorite smoke
and
So I feel like a lot of people don't give you know sky Jaro the credit that it deserves and you know
I've even talked to Jackson and he said he you know
There's people that still find root beer turps and you know Jaro crosses and sky Jaro crosses
So it's it's you know, it's there but I'm really a fuel head
I like a lot of
gassiness and whatnot
And then as far as the lime one goes I mean that's
From what I understand that's the mom to the black lime reserve
and she I mean I have a
citrus vino right now that I mean it is absolutely like you just graded some lines on a
Zester and that's just in veg like I'm about to flip it in a couple weeks. So I'm really excited about that one
But the lime turps are it's I
Don't know what's so different about it
but compared to lemon like you can really kind of tell the difference in it and I feel like it has
a bit more of our narcotic kind of smoke to it with
people that have give given flower to they they
Constantly tell me like, you know, it's a great nighttime smoke
And so I don't know if there's a correlation between kind of whatever is producing the lime turps is kind of helping with
Being more of a heavy smoke compared to lemon
I feel like the more lemon citrus turps come out in hazes and other kind of
narrow leaf varieties
So I'm just really interested because the citrus vino
Blr and f2 that I have right now is a very wide leaf broad leaf
Cultivar so I'm kind of wondering if there's a
Correlation between like lime being a little bit more towards
narrow leaf cultivars and lemon more towards
my bad
lime towards broad leaf cultivars and
lemon towards narrow leaf cultivars I
Can from my experience with
growing out some of the Golden Coast
Vintage Afghan I can definitely say there were gassy lime turps in that one
they range there was a purple Fino that was your kind of
Purple candy grape sort of thing and then there were the green Fino's were all very lime and
it's funny that
You mentioned it in reference to Jackson because when I was growing them out
Jackson also came up in posted in the comments and had mentioned that he had found a lot of limes in those and
was I
Making a similar hypothesis as yours right now that the that lime trait is something
That's in those old Ghani lines, and it's it's definitely
From his experience and from my experience running out the vintage Afghan
It's something that's coming from Central Asia much more than associated with those narrow leaf tropical varieties
This is a quiet bunch. There was a
Chat question
From Matthew Bowden back back on the topic of
That we were on before what ratios is everyone used for STS and what timeline example 9 to 1 5 to 1 10 days before
On my mind's a 9 to 1 and I start
7 to 10 days prior to flower and then I hit it up again
5 to
7 days after flower and
Then I do that again on the same amount of time depending on the cultivar that I'm using
So if it's a quick flowering plant, it's closer to that five day on the sprays
If it's a longer flower say like my haze or a blue dream or super lemon a tie
Then I can go to that 10-day period
I've found on what I'm using and I do nodal spring. I don't spray the full plant
I found that spraying the whole plant causes too much phytotoxicity
And I end up with issues with stunted growth
pace of the plant slows down so the metabolism becomes halted and then I have issues later on with
flower size from the sprayed plant and
Actually getting a viable pollen if I spray the whole plant
So I try to concentrate my spraying on the nodes that I'm after
So even if I'm doing just a single branch
Just a small specific area if I'm doing a full plant then I go through and spray each flower cluster as much as
possible since
Ethylene builds up in each receptor
Separately so spraying one part of the plants not gonna affect the whole plant
You need to make sure you spray the parts that you want reverse
and see I've
The last STS I did on my lamb breath reserve
You know, I was doing like Tony just said hitting just the nodes
but then again, I had a plant behind it that was catching a lot of the
excess spray and getting more of a whole plant spray and
That one flipped without any issues and it barely got missed from
The STS from the initial plant that I was trying to reverse
So and I didn't necessarily notice, you know what Tony's explaining but then again I wasn't
necessarily drenching the whole plant
Compared to it just catching some fine mist from me spraying my lamb breath reserve. So, um
Yeah, that's it's it's very I feel like very genetic specific very
Just varies plant to plant honestly
Yeah, because we're just affecting a dodginess homo level so every specific
Plant that came from a different seed is going to have a different
Set of genes in her so she's going to have a completely different phenotypical expression to the hormones that we're trying to sway
by using these blockers, so spring say you spray a
Skywalker in the front right you're trying to reverse the Skywalker
But behind the Skywalker you have a bubble above it barely catches some mist and reverses easily
Which is something that I found the Baba doesn't have issues with
reversing similar to some of the other lines that when you do reverse them don't want to spit out that pollen for you and
it comes down to every plant having a
specific set of endogenous hormone ratios and those are what you're trying to
Sway, so what you do to a blue dream isn't what you're going to do to a haze or even in that same genotype
You might have to spray one specific female
differently than her sister, you know because she has a
Different ethylene level that she's able to handle right or that you're swaying
so you she may not have her at least wait as easily as her sister and I've showed that with my
Space cush me knows when I reverse those to show people that my number two, you know did not like to reverse at all
She was extremely ethylene stable
So even though I was using silver to alter the ethylene levels
Unlike her number one and number three sisters
She did not want to reverse at all and that was something that the male showed also when I tried to reverse him
He had issues with wanting to reverse it was extremely difficult
So both of those plants those phenotype or genotypes from the gene pool were showing a similar trait
through the
ethylene
Receptors they were both stable in the endogenous hormone levels that they were producing which is something that you look for when you're breeding
That's why you I wanted to reverse my females and my males to find out which one of the phenotypes
I would want to do most of my breeding to when I would made my f2s my f3s and my f4s
That's why I ended up going through my number two
You know once I reversed the males and the females to find out which one was showing more similar traits to the male
Visually since I wasn't able to do
Chromosome testing so this gave me a visual cue of what I was after in my breeding project
And I've definitely I noticed that
Because I when I did my first STS reversal on garlic sherbert, you know, I did
Your normal strength and you know, she took it just fine
And then I did it on my lime breath reserve and it burnt she got all types of burnt
like leaf and
Just stunted growth kind of like you're talking about earlier and she I had to dial it back about
Half and I had to dilute the solution to about half
To be able to get her to not stunt and burn
Like that and that was also that diluted spray is also what caused a
GMO to direwolf cross to start to reverse almost immediately just catching
Mist from the lime breath reserve. So it it was very interesting to see how the garlic sherbert
Handle it and was doing it fine and then trying it on my lime breath reserve and it just
Didn't like it at all and then diluting it allowed me to
Make it happen and then seeing that the GMO cross just wanted to reverse almost with
Just mist from the STS. So it I definitely noticed that
Like that GMO has athlete sensitivity. We know that and since both of us talked to
Jackson when we were picking up some of the seed stock that we use he
told us that that limelight is something that you really need to look into also and watch it so
Possibly that combination of those two genes caused a plant that's highly ethylene sensitive. That's why it reversed so easily
And that's something that you would want to make sure you probably don't introduce
to
Other seed lines with showing that exact same tree
So you're probably going to increase it if you took that phenol
That's a good that's a good little side note there because we both picked up those
Skyjaro seeds I believe at the same time when we were at the cup brother
That it's killer line Jackson stuff that he that you pulled out especially what you were pulling out of there
So you're probably going to increase it if you took that phenotype across it to say another plant that shows
Ethylene sensitivity next thing you know, you have a seed line that's gonna pop out of there that could show that same thing
That it's killer line Jackson stuff that he that you pulled out
Especially what you were pulling out of there a lot of that breeding you did that came from that seed stock was killer
Yeah, and I was honestly pulling a lot of I ended up hitting the skyjaro to black lime reserve
And I was pulling out a lot of skunkiness out of there
And so that's why I ended up calling that line, Colorado roadkill
Because there's definitely has zero skunk traits, but I was finding some skunk in there and so I'm definitely
I've been looking through that line
since I
got going a
Lot of heavy Afghani influence coming through in the breeding that Jackson did on that
It's good to show a lot of people if you're looking for specific
Terpene profiles some of the lines that you should be trying to dig into to find those
Instead of just digging into the name on the pack
Yeah, Jackson's got a lot of great gear a lot of stuff that was held up in the
In the North Mendoz South Humboldt area for a long time. And so that gear that he's got it
he introduces new shit and you know, the OG's and the pure kush's and
The different flavors that have you know come around and him and I have had some some nice discussions about the impact that
the the influx of clone only's had on the
Mendo region in our region and kind of like the moving away from our old traditional seed lines
But he's somebody who really kept those going and it's it's definitely worth it to go in and check out some of his stuff
that isn't necessarily the hype stuff like was getting mentioned at the beginning of this discussion because
there's a lot of value in those seed lines like you're saying you can find the skunks the
opinion lines are really nice and
he just has a lot of stuff that's been maintained or has an
older lineage and gene pool in it that isn't necessarily just you know a
Retread of the last 10 to 20 years of hype
cuts it's actually something that was
You know a variety that was maintained and kept in that area
multiple different varieties that he's then used to cross with his different commercial releases and it's nice I'm always
I
Enjoy going through his lines and seeing the diversity and seeing the
Not so much the hype cut that I see in the crosses
But also some of the stuff that are those older heirloom lines for Mendo
It goes to show the importance of
Working lines that you actually appreciate and not necessarily
You know chasing the next Vogue thing because I guess just like fashion or anything else that
You know cultivars will become trendy again
It's just being able to hold on them and to preserve them in the the short term until they become popular again
I definitely believe in that because I've
Constantly always on as far as my breeding goes it's for what I want not for what the market wants
you know and
You know, I just post pictures of what I grow and people hit me up for seeds of what I grow
So it's just like I don't
Personally, I don't cultivate or breed for the market
I breed for what I like and what you know, pleases me and
I just end up offering up, you know seeds that I've made and it's just I've never felt the need to
like
Follow the market. I've always felt like you know, I just want to stick to doing my own thing and doing what I love and
searching, you know for the next best thing and so
Yeah, I feel like definitely being able to search through Jackson's true
Tried and true genetics that he's preserved over the years is definitely allowed
Well, I mean to kind of have fun with what I want to do
Yeah, brother Lucas after me and you spoke at the Emil Cup back in 2014 man
it's been awesome to watch the breeding stuff that you've dove into man, especially with a lot of the
OG stuff that you've went into because that is my favorite type of herb OG's diesels earthy Afghani
So when I started seeing you doing breeding into those kind of lines, man
it it was awesome to see because we had a killer us talk when we were at the Emil Cup about breeding and
Like basically had to get into it
I'll tell everybody the same thing that I told Lucas back then the best thing to do is just to start doing it and
Start doing it from your own perspective in your own heart
and that's going to be the easiest way for you to start to recognize and
experience the
Plant on a positive level. So yeah, I just wanted to tell you that brother. I
Always appreciate you and all the knowledge you
So giftfully give to everybody it is very appreciated
Hey guys, I had a quick question if now's a good time
specific to reversal techniques
Has anyone honed in on using gibberellic acid or GA3
specifically on its own and what kind of PPMs and
Timing of spray schedule would that look like? I know it's possible, but I've kind of had issues with plants
Stretching beyond belief and then if it's too high a PPM
With it totally inhibiting the flower production altogether
Well, just so we don't stay super silent
That's not my strong suit. So I don't personally know I
Personally haven't delved in there and I would kind of feel that it would be due to the fact that
Because they stretch so much it makes it very difficult to try to do in a reversal on them
Unless you maybe did like a clone straight out the cloner into you know a pot
But you're the fact that they stretch so bad and that it's very delicate as far as PPM levels go
That just STS is so much easier that it
Necessarily hasn't been pursued as much as other avenues
But you know now that you've spoken about it
I do have some gibberellic acid and I you know, I will give it a try
GA3 does induce maleness and hemp and cannabis, but it does induce stretching when used it to high of a level
I've only used it mostly for
trying to help with popping older seed stock and with
Adding it to STS like Alex Hardy's bringing up in the comments on YouTube trying to add that
in conjunction with spraying with STS to try to get plants like a bubba or a
Urkel or something that's very short and squat to stretch out by giving it a initial spray of ga3
prior to starting the STS so that plant
gets a hormonal response to try to
Extend cellular structure and then it gives me the ability to go in and spray the nodes where I want them a
little bit easier I
Haven't been able to tell whether or not what I was doing was more effective or not because I haven't done enough side-by-side with that
My question is has anybody sprayed gibberellic acid in the middle of STS like, you know
Spray five days before flowering and then maybe day one of flowering spray ST
Gibberellic acid to allow a little bit more stretching and then maybe that will allow the inter nodal
growth between salmon and flowers to be
Expanded so you can actually collect more. I
Have not tried that in the middle of flower. No
Well, I sounds like it's something I need to try and get back to everybody about
I guess I will try it on my next reversal project
and
Tony I'm
I'm trying to cook dinner right now, but
Do you see some of those questions in the YouTube chat or comments?
Someone talked about kind of what lines you all working that you might want to reverse down the road
Yeah, I've been trying to catch some of those I've got so many questions going by so fast on this little computer
It's hard to answer them for myself right now. My next reversal project is I
Won't want to do my odd dog line. It's a Kim variant
It's a Kim 91 across to my Icarus og which is a rug burn og cross to my angel
The rug burn og has ghost og Kim in it. So what comes out of there is a plant that's extremely
Kim dominant
it's something I want to add to my
my ogs my sours I
Want to try to pop some stuff out of that that I can find more accurate
Og type terpenes coming out of there. I don't want to say the word skunky, but that's what everybody knows
We're looking for the very loud files and esters that are coming out of some of these plants that
Have been bred to just look pretty and not be loud
Cuz that's what we're all after
We're after that old school herb that we can smell in somebody's pocket across the concert area
And we're searching that cat out the last time I ran into somewhere like that was in
2011 at the no effects concert somebody whipped out some herb on the other side of the arena
We were in the Hard Rock Cafe. And as soon as he lit that joint man, I hunted the cat down
I could not find him security got to him before I did and he ended up running out the place
But that dude had some bomb ass weed
I was trying to find a dude hoping for some seeds in his herb
Because it's been a while since I smelled weed that loud in a long time
Personally I'm
Still trying to successfully reverse garlic sherbert, which is blue sherbert cross to
GMO by in-house genetics, which is an s1 or not s1 but a feminized line
so that's kind of why I had the question earlier about
People having troubles with fans of first regs
Because I definitely want to work that
Turp profile and medicinal effect into some more of
the
typical I guess
cookie hybrid looking lines that I already have
to add more of
better terpene profile to them instead of
what I get is
Kind of a hashy kind of fresh asphalt smell to some of them that I've ran
I'm also kind of looking for some
New aspects to
reinvigorate OG kush breath
Recently got OG kush breath. And as everyone knows with her she is
Retardedly slow as far as vegetative growth goes
So I definitely am looking at some avenues to keep her
Still
Have OG kush back
OG kush breath background as far as maybe
Grandparents was in the line and making back crosses
but bringing in that kind of new hybrid vigor to allow for a little bit better vegetative rate and
a little bit better
Terpene profile to her. So that's kind of what I'm working on at the moment
What I just finished this season I
Named a new strain called Odonata, which was Santa Maria
times top 44 times cantaloupe
And then I crossed my grape ape female to
That Odonata and made a grape Odonata. And then I also made a
blueberry kush which is
The
original release blueberry from DJ short that I've been lugging around the country for
Over 20 years now that I crossed that with my pure kush
F3 and then just playing around. I also made a black bubble, which is
the
98 pre-bubble kush female times
Kush female times the Vietnamese black
Which is a land race cultivar from Vietnam
That sounds killer man, I'm a bubble addict so that one sounds nice
Can we talk a little about the Vietnamese black because I uh,
Like I know blackbird has a Vietnamese black and I've just started to see it kind of coming through
inventory wise
Yep, give me one second. I'm walking to a room where my service is better. I'm getting a little choppy. Give me one second
I'm currently making dinner right now. We got some steak chicken
mushrooms
Brussels sprouts
I'm wondering, uh, did you use uh bodies stuff or stuff from snow high with the vietnam black haze man?
No, I actually uh, I got it whenever I uh graduated from culinary school
I was still working in japanese steakhouses. So, um, that's whenever I went to
um
Jamaica and was there for about a year and then while I was running the japanese steakhouses, obviously I got to meet
um a bunch of different asians, which the the funny thing about japanese steakhouses is I know this completely off subject, but
Probably 90 of them in the u.s
They're actually korean owned and probably about 80 of the chef are actually hispanic. So, um, you know
I always thought that I'd get a kick out of when people
I'd get to the table and they'd be like, oh
What part of japan are you from and i'd look at them and i'd be like i'm from the east side
But anyways, um, I got to meet people from uh from vietnam
So i've you know
Just been someone that has been very adamant on making relationships with people that have friends and family outside of the u.s
to be able to acquire genetics that I don't have the ability to uh get
um, you know on the regular so
um, you know, I've found people that i've trusted throughout the years that you know have
You know right connections and uh, you know, sometimes i've gotten stuff that has been absolutely bullshit
But uh, I grew out the vietnamese black this this last year
um, and
You know, it was interesting enough that it made me want to to continue with it. Um, some of the terpenes were
Um a little on the citrusy side. There was some that kind of had like a spicy hint to them as well
um, so I really haven't worked the line to be able to dive in deep enough to be able to say this is what the
Exact profile is for it
Um, but um just because I had a limited amount
Of of seed, you know, I just do what I can with what I have available
I definitely I i've been in your shoes because I work with a lot of jamaicans
At work and i've asked them about you know, the good old traditional like jamaican land spread
And they pretty much all tell me that uh, the genetics are just have been so integrated with new
genetics that it's like
pretty hard to find and none of
the
Families that I know of are able to get that necessary
jamaican lamb spread
um
But I definitely know what you mean trying to get in with good relations with people to try to get seed stock of like
original
land race type stuff
I know that uh, the vietnamese black that I had had a very unique, uh leaf structure to it
I'm, one I want to say that had either like 12 or 13 blades to it
and
um, you know, which is obviously
abnormal
and then besides that I know that the flowering time for the
Version that I had say it's like 16 to 17 weeks total
So
That's why I I crossed it to the that pre-98 bubba kush
uh female that i've also been lugging around forever just because
I wanted to try to cut down on the flowering time to be able to
Bring some of these cultivars that we would almost never see in a commercial setting at least never grown
um
In any setting besides an outdoor setting
um
So that way, you know i'm offering different flavors for people
Definitely I uh
I'll go ahead. Tony
I was just gonna say i'm about to introduce that bubba into some back cross breeding myself
Nice nice
Um, I did a similar kind of project to this. I uh grew a melange gold that is uh
Supposedly a cousin of malawi gold. It's like
a
next mountain range over
but
I grew her in socal outdoors and she went
to the
About third week in november
And I ended up hitting a certain uh, one fino that was kind of a runt. They were all extremely
vigorous
Uh would have been 15 foot had I not lst them and train them
uh, but I had a really
Specific fino that I hit to a ghost train haze male from rare dankness
Um to try to shorten that flower time and I ended up taking some of that flower to jackson
in
2014
And he and I took him some seed too
And he had smelt it and he said it smelled like some old school columbian to him
Which kind of surprised me because the genetics, you know that I was told is it was melange gold
which is supposedly from africa and
You know jackson's assimilating it to some dank, you know columbian that you know
He had smelled once upon a time. And so I ended up uh popping a lot of those seeds that I made and uh,
I got a specific female that is
Oh, it is the
Perfect example of the mother and it has more vigor
than
the fino the mother and it
Flowers quicker because of the ghost train haze in it, but it doesn't necessarily bring the ghost train haze profiles in there
it has more of the
the mother's uh profiles in there, so i'm very
Excited to kind of play with this one
um because it definitely uh
Interested jackson a bit when I took him some flower
um
but I definitely uh
Know what you mean when it comes to shortening the flower time, but because they they go forever
And by the way forever I've wanted to uh put together a conversation with lucas tony and jackson and uh
Hopefully that'll happen soon. I know uh when I mentioned it to jackson. He was like i'm working literally till bedtime every day
uh, but
Because I think that those two can you talk about kind of?
You know and then tony maybe back in the other direction like you you've been drawn to tony and jackson and kind of
why
So, um
Actually, you know, I had added both of them
On facebook just randomly. I don't know. I think it was because of the chill garden
Uh form that's kind of on facebook
And you know, I was i'm a lot younger than both of them
Uh, so I was definitely looking to learn from people that were previously experienced in this
and so, you know from adding them on facebook and talking to them and then
I think it was two thousand
2012
2013 I met jackson at a la cannabis cup
I met him and leo working
uh in a fishing auto booth and
You know took him some flour and got to talk to him. It was actually
Before they were, you know, extremely busy and you couldn't actually even you know get to talk to him because there was such a big line
But it was great, you know talking to him and finally putting a you know name to a face as far as like facebook goes
like
You know, I only knew jackson as a pitbull
Facebook profile, you know and then finally getting to meet him and talk to him and talk to about his genetics
And this that and the other
It was really awesome. And then
It was 2014
um
You know, uh
my uh parents and I actually were
gonna, you know go up to the emerald cup and
You know, I had talked to them about possibly, you know having some friends that i've met on facebook, you know
Hanging out and this that and the other and we did an airbnb and they were like, you know
how come you know have him come stay with us and this that and the other and so
2014 I got to
You know actually meet up with tony and meet up with levi of pistol positive genetics and um
Rain man, he was an amazing tester keith. He's a great tester outside of michigan
And um, you know got to hang out with him for the weekend and go to emerald cup with him and learn a lot
you know just from talking and
smoking and hanging out and
Then uh 2015 we pretty much kind of did it again and uh
unfortunately, we haven't done it since then but i've
i've learned so much from tony and jackson and levi that uh
You know, they they they are my mentors to how I selectively breed today essentially
Yeah, brother, um
I would back up everything he's saying man
I met a lot of the folks that I know on facebook and through the old forums
And a lot of the facebook groups that were on growing back a few years back
Um, I had ran into rayman first around uh, 2011
I'm, the first person that cat ever spoke to about cannabis on facebook. Um, he ended up becoming one of my testers. I
I started using rayman
For uh running basically everything I could in a cold environment that was completely different from mine
And so I used to send that cat seeds all the time
and I hadn't met him until uh, we all met up in 2014 like uh, lucas says for the uh,
emerald cup
Before that we'd all just been online speaking
in the groups talking about our experience with the plant how it either helped us or trying to help other people with uh,
Gardening tips or breeding tips or just basically giving our perspective with how we've used the plant
and then um
in 2012, uh
Just like he said I had been speaking with so many breeders man. Just like back in the day my only uh,
The only thing I ever wanted out of cannabis when I started to go public was to meet some folks that
Basically were creating the strains that we were all smoking man
You know, I wanted to run in to people like chimera here dj short
There are these people that in my mind were doing something that I wanted to become better at doing myself
All right, and one of the first people that I run into that
Showed a gang of experience would have been uh, jackson me and jackson used to talk in the groups
Uh and in private on some of the stuff we were working on
and through that I end up uh
gaining some
uh
I guess you'd say street credit through some of the other breeders once they start seeing me speaking to some of the breeders that
they already uh
Respect right? So from that
I start
Becoming more open with cannabis and that's when I start to decide i'm going to meet people face to face
And the first people that I meet would been rain man levi
uh jackson and lucas
Those are the cats that I first
Showed my face to in the public right and they end up becoming lifelong friends with me because of their
Life mentality and not because of anything they could offer to me besides their experience in that life that they're all living right?
Each one of them showed me something different through the plant that I hadn't been able to see because of my own narrow
Uh thinking because i'd already been locked in a room for way too long
So I start seeing jackson and what he's doing and how he's going about things
And it would steer me to a different direction right and through that I start realizing that I should offer more information other people in case
they uh
Just don't want to take that first step and one of the first people that I really spoke to like
Heartfelt was lucas and I brought that up earlier me and lucas had a tip
Real heart to heart at the 2014. Uh emerald cup. We had all rented a house. It was me. Uh, levi from pistol positive
Uh rain man who tested for all three of our companies eventually because at this time lucas did not have his company
He was still a hobby grower and breeder, right? He had been growing some lines that him and his family liked at home
And he had been sending some stuff to me
And to levi and to jackson to try to get uh information on the genetics that he was actually playing with to see if the information
He was given like the line his dad used to like
whoops
called uh
green crack and he used to
Run a line through there and we all gave him back the same information through it
That's how he started to respect the information. Some people would give and some others would not I believe
um, that's how I ended up doing things back in the day like if I could get the same information from people I respected then
I believed that that information was probably true and I started seeing him doing the same thing
He wasn't trying to be a guy that was just pushing what he believed already on the people
He was trying to either offer his version of a situation
and then trying to absorb the other sides that other people were offering and
That
We become friends and like you said, he's the youngest of all of us. So I end up giving him a nickname
I call him baby. Bubba. That's my partner right there
and from that day on we become brothers through cannabis where
Um, we help each other as much as we can
Um, we will we shoot things off each other our breeding projects. Um
We send like i've sent seeds to lucas and levi to run stuff through to look through that were given to me from kevin
like special stuff, uh
These he's one of the guys that I share stuff with that
I probably wouldn't give to anybody else just because of the friendship that me and him forged
Through just a keyboard, right? So a lot of people believe
We're speaking real quick I have the
Cdsr fuel line f2 is about to head out to you in about a month or two
Yeah, that line is killer. Levi used that in a couple his crosses. I did about 10 crosses last year in it
Um, I call it the ghost of port royale that ghost times kim dog special reserve
That line is going to breed you some killer og style plants. I know that's what you love. That's why I sent it to you
Um, it's uses the fuel mail that kevin sifted out of the uh, black lime reserve
And a ghost og female which is the same female that he passed to me
So I ended up using those seeds i've been sifting them since 2017 when he gave them to me
at the uh wonderland seed series
And I eventually found a mail that I wanted to use out of that and started to pollinate some girls
and the mail I keep from there I call it the ghost of port royale to give respect back to kevin since his uh,
His farm is called uh port royale
and that I use that to introduce a lot of
That star dog that star dog will produce a lot of uh progeny that are very close to it
but you will find those
Uh rare plants that will show those line profiles that come out of the black lime reserve that works
from jackson his jackson's
So, yeah, uh, we we've been friends for a while and from there we just like I said, uh
Lucas didn't have a company in 2014. The next thing you know, he starts diving into breeding and not just making seeds, right?
He's not just making seeds and being quiet about things. He's still trying to learn while he's doing it
He's offering information that he has as he does it
And he's not being an uppity asshole like some of the cats out there from back in the day, man
There's people out there that because they think they can make seeds
That everyone below them is some kind of asshole and right when you find people that aren't like that
Uh, it's it's killer to steer him that way because not only will you help them it helps yourself right from that
You expand the whole
Environment the whole community learns more and the more we share with each other
The better the plant becomes
And the better we all become right it forms a bond that we never had before and it's all because of a plant that we
We were talking about in forums like we're doing right now. We're all speaking
Some of us are typing on youtube
And it's instead of just taking uh all this time to troll each other
We could actually be finding out if maybe some cat on here has got the same kind of ailment that I have
Or they take breeding and it's their idea of breeding is so close to yours that it's just
uh second nature that you guys should maybe be doing some kind of collaboration so that the plants that you both have
can offer a more uh
More efficient cannabinoid for our systems, right?
There's going to be people out there that need something specific that both of you can offer
and it's only going to be possible because you guys met through a forum that
A long time ago when I grew up we didn't have when I was lucas's age. There was no way possible
For me to find someone else that was like-minded
like me
That could offer me any kind of knowledge that I could use to expand my own breeding
So I had to figure this shit out the hard way
I had to go to the library and dig through books, right? I had to try to figure out that I needed to look into
Breeding with uh cucumbers and strawberries and other plants to find the information that I was looking for because at that time
Cannabis wasn't a research plant. There's no information for people
Like ourselves that are breeders to find back in the 80s and the 90s. We had to figure this damn shit out
So when you have some information that you can offer
based in your experience, even if you're not a
Uh, you're not trained right? You didn't go to school. You don't have to go learn this stuff
through a book
This plant's been growing on this earth for so long that if you just take enough time to stop and smell the roses it produces
Eventually you can figure out what life's trying to give you and that's what the plant has taught me
Slow down and figure some shit out. It saved my life multiple times and not just because it got me high
but because of the people that influenced my life from actually using this plant like lucas like
Jackson, right like when I when I was sick in the hospital jackson
Was the only person that
Made sure I had some medication
From cannabis because I could not grow my family could not produce enough and they were taking care of me
and
jackson through his uh
his
His heart and his mentality made sure I had medicine
The only person I know right and this is a cat I meet
through
Forums and being open with the plant
This is why i'm always hard on cats when they hit me up to test
And they've only got two posts on instagram because if you're not going to be open with this plant
Someone's going to suffer
And when you are open with it
Less and less people suffer. So I'm not trying to be a dick
I'm, just trying to use my perspective to maybe open up your eyes a little bit when it comes to that kind of shit eventually
When you share information someone it comes back and saves your life, which is what happened with me
If I would have never spoke to jackson
about cannabis
I'd probably be dead today
And that's a fact
Well, I think you bring up a good point that for
The ones that are truly engulfed in cannabis cannabis is a lifestyle, you know, it's not something that we uh
Just use at the end of the day that you know for me it's like I eat breathe and sleep
Everything that I deal with is somehow cannabis related
And I I even find myself getting uh offended whenever I see things that are on the television
that you know put a
negative light in regards to
cannabis abuse
Um, or just cannabis use as a whole
Um, which I don't believe in um, and just also to change the subject if you guys want to click on my little uh,
picture there I uh put up a picture of
My grape odonata. That was my grape ape leaning
version that ended up being a standard grape ape
with uh, a really fruity, uh skunk smell like just your your standard skunk number one that
Be growing now not a true skunk
I'm still trying to figure out how to access like the chat and all that
The chat is the little arrow thing so if you want to
Um to say you wanted to chat to tony you would literally hit on tony's icon and then you would just hit the message
um, that's there or if you just wanted to open up your
um your back channel
Um, it'll pull up your history and everyone that you've talked to
Um, the only thing that I don't know about
um
This thing is I don't know if you're able to erase
anything on clubhouse, so
Just fyi for anyone
Is on here
um be careful because i'm just going to assume that this is all recorded so
Um, you know rico is a thing for some people. Um, so it is something that I would like to uh,
just point that out and to uh stress that we want to make sure that none of our guests or anybody
can potentially get in trouble so just
Be careful, I guess what's said
Yeah, and just quit this conversation definitely is recorded and uh lucas. I think the chat is over on youtube
so if you went to youtube and uh
you could watch the video and and
There's an entire another world chatting away on youtube about all sorts of stuff completely unrelated to the main topic
Yeah, brother open up two screens on your phone or your computer and put youtube on one and uh,
And clubhouse on the other and you can watch both at the same time
I just have my phone but my phone does two screen type things. So i'll do that
Lucas I have confidence in your ability to make this happen
I was referring more to just clubhouse as a whole and not necessarily the the future cannabis project stuff because obviously everything's on youtube
That's done by peter
Yes, there are no trees falling in the woods here
What tree
Falling quietly in the woods
Are you posting this on the uh number two account? Yes. Oh
So what new projects, uh breeding projects have everybody out here that's uh speaking tonight been working on
Lately since we're all breeders. What's got everybody's attention?
I made a bunch of crosses with the tkm10 that was made by um
Mr. Bob hemphill and hannibal
Combined they are crickets and cicadas
Um, but a few years back I think probably
16 or 17. Um, they made a
number of crosses with the m10 which is a super sativa seed club
um
Variety that it was really mel frank's afghani number one that was taken over to
amsterdam by uh, skunk man, sam david watson
and
so
the m10s a an inbred afghan line and it was hit to the
Tk and a whole bunch of other things. Um
I grew out a bunch of them
in 2017
and then grew out
uh a bunch more this year and
it's
It's a really enjoyable line
um
It's something that it's got a lot of the og tk
type phenos, but the
The m10 is something that it brings just
Really really solid growth structure. So anybody who's grown in og knows they can be kind of viney kind of
less
Less structurally sound and uh
The m10 really provides a backbone for the tk to to shine on and so that's nice and
It's a line. I know they've done further work with it there. They've made a
um a second version, um
And of the tk m10 and they've made a whole bunch of other crosses with the m10
They've hit it to the panama red. They've hit it to
um
uh
A number of things and they're releasing them now
And so it's it's fun to go back through that gene pool
Make a bunch of crosses and see all the crosses that everybody else has made with it
I know ital foundation has done some work with the tk m10
swamp boys did a back cross hitting it back to the tk and released a
I think a
Miami waves or something. It was a cross that they made
um and released a couple years ago and
So a lot of work has been done with the line. It's been, you know incorporated into a bunch of people's work
And I just made a bunch of seeds just for shits and giggles
We'll see what comes of it. It hit it to everything that I got my hands on this year
um, lots of different ogs
and
Different things that are essentially back crosses
um
That i'm really excited to go through large scale populations and see what those og back crosses come out with
and other than that
I hit it to a lot of things that are
stupid high testers in the commercial market and
Having seen some early coas from it
it's up there in the the 28 29 30 percent thc range and
And
With the market where it is. It's one of those things. I I assume these will pair well together and have some
commercial viability in the
Arms race that is the thc percentage game
So as far as og meaning
Because I I have I purchased some of these seeds a while back
Um, i'm assuming kind of gassy and fuely and whatnot
um
Because I do kind of plan to do
It would be nice to find hopefully I found a decent male out of uh those
Uh to hit to possibly san fernando og
Uh face on fire, which is wi-fi
og cross to face on fire by archive
um
king louis
But I i've been wondering about those and thinking about popping those
Uh for this reason and if you're saying they have a lot of nice og background to them
Uh kind of entices me to pop them a little bit sooner than later
um
especially being able to kind of invigorate the
Stature of ogs as far as super lanky and whatnot
um
What exactly I guess kind of profiles did you get from the terpene aspect from the phenos you ran?
So what I noticed with them is that in the og spectrum you're getting a
A one that's a little bit more cariopheline dominant that is not the the
Preferred business. It's still in the realm. It's got that gassiness to it, but it's a bit more peppery
um
And then there's a much more
I wouldn't call it lemony, but it's more of the lemon gas
Profile that it's not exactly lemony, but it's in that realm and
it's
I'm, pretty sure like I know
Mr. Bob hemphill did his own back cross project and he selected males and the progeny that came off of that project
were
Really really gassy and were much more in that traditional sort of like
lemon fuel funk sort of range and
That's where I um, those are the phenos that I prefer out of it. Um
Even though the like m10 is not necessarily. Um
It's not you know, if you're doing an og back cross project, it's obviously not what you're going for
But it's interesting the way that the terps pair together. Um
You get some really intense musky funk that while it's not og it's
fucking foul and
With that being said do you get like a like a stale kind of basement?
Kind of yes musky. Yes. Okay
Because I get I get a lot of that in my og reserve
I have this og reserve that I kept around and it's like it's og
But it has that musky kind of like basement kind of funk to it
Yeah, yeah, and so this has that
but the thing that I think the og brings to it is that it
Like I grew out a number of the hybrids the m10 crosses and
the really intense m10 crosses were all very muted in their terps relative to the you know, the chems or the
The og leaners that I was getting out of the different crosses and um
but the
Just going through them like fresh batch in the last couple of weeks. I've been really impressed with how
Punch you in the face musky. It is it's not like yep. Yep
It's not just like oh that smells like musky muted
afghan, it's like
fuck that is
That's gnarly and yeah, no because there's certain there's uh certain cultivars of mine that
Have that and she's like I I can't trim it around her but my wife because she's just like that's just too
It's too much
Yeah, there were definitely some in the population that like the most intense muskiest were like not the ones
Um
and
the another thing about it and like
When people asked about what would you like to do a reversal with this is actually a line i'd like to do
I would like to do a back cross project similar to what you're doing
but instead of selecting from the male population selecting from the female population because
the
the afghan males like
or females like
They're you can find them. You'll notice them structurally. They're morphologically. They're way different
They have much more stout
very broad leaf it's a completely different plant than the uh tks
but the tk leaners
What you'll notice is
Even though there are like I said multiple sort of gassy phenos
they're
that
Differentiation is impossible to make through morphology. You could kind of make a differentiation morphologically between
there's a
subset of like sweet outliers, they've got like tropical almost like the uh,
uh
Fruity pebbles og or whatever like there's one that it literally tastes like fruit loops
like the milk, um
After you've eaten fruit loops, you know how it's like kind of like sweet and grainy. Um, yeah
Yeah, so like cereal milk. I yeah, there's like some weird cereal milks or the turps in
um
the the outliers and those ones are the most
quote unquote
morphologically sativa type varieties or phenotypes. They're very stretchy very long very narrow leaf and
They're nice they've got
You know a unique turf profile that sets them aside. Um, they're not og
but then in the og there's like
They kind of differentiate into these two extremes of the karyophylline
peppery dominant versus the more lemony gassy and like even some of them
kind of having a tropical fruit vibe to them, but or like
Almost like skittlesy where they're like there's like a sweetness to them. Um,
but
being able to make that level of selection and differentiation is really hard and you know chimera talks about this a lot where
you know
Selecting for those traits
On the males like i've literally gone through i've popped
400 seeds from the tkm10 and gone through about
I did 36 females a couple years ago, and I think we did 60 females this year. So like almost 100 females
and
it's you know, I
I did a big male selection. I did it very big because I knew I couldn't make this discernment
In the in the profiles in the ogs, you know, so I just wanted to
cast a broad net to capture the breadth of the gene pool that leaned towards the ogs so that I could then
In this back cross at least have some you know
I know that some of the seeds that got made got pollinated by og leaners that are of the type that I like
but not all of them so
Being able to make that intensive selection and that sort of discernment by doing a
You know ephemera versal onto your ogs would be really cool with those seeds and I I think well worth it like I
I fucking love the like having grown out almost 100 of them over several seasons. I really really like it
So with that being said how much have you noticed?
Or I guess
Between kind of
Different females. Have you noticed like a difference in profile and terpenes compared to
growing
Then compared to like curing
You know, like I feel like I had a face on fire that was like super gassy growing
But then as I cured it out, it was like more like a sandalwood
Gassy kind of, you know profile to it
Don't forget about esters and the volatility of them
In the whole scheme of things because obviously we all know the difference between the smell of a live plant
Versus once we cut that thing down that almost immediately something is lost
True true
Yeah, i'd say that
The
From my experience with it. It cures up very nicely and you get those gassy profiles you get the sweeter profiles as well
um to cure up well
the musky phenos do like it's really hard to keep that musky terp from
Oxidizing into something that is super unpleasant. And so i've noticed that too
Yeah, yeah that's been i've always found that like
Those musky profiles are really they're kind of you know
Smoke them early if you like them, but their shelf life is kind of dwindling. Uh, yeah, it's kind of you know
I feel like that and then like, you know, some of the uh
the terpinolines can also have a
A
shorter shelf life just because of the viscosity and how intense like
the corrosion that they have within you'll see like
They'll just start
off gassing their terps and you'll end up with these sweat rings on the tops of your jars of like
essentially
Wondering if like you can possibly
Cross cultivars like blr to
strains like that or cultivars like that that you can
kind of preserve
You know all those
Possibly off gassing terpenes and keep those inside
You know for extraction or just even for flower production
Hmm
I'm, you know, I think this is where everything has its niche and like diversifying production methods and
applications is something that's going to be
We're going to see
significant gains in terms of concentrate production when we have better
you know specification for
these terpenes these processes
these
sort of cuticles these processes and
Really start breeding with that in mind and developing cultivars that are specifically
designed for extraction and you know, I mean
historically
there was a mass selection just through traditional afghan or you know mass cultivation of
Hash production cultivars, but a lot of that got disrupted and you know, I feel like
There's a possibility that some of these m10 varieties will actually be better as extracts
then as smoked flour just because that's kind of what they were traditionally used for presumably and
like perhaps that musky funky turf that
Oxidizes really quickly is something that if you extract it quickly
Won't turn won't degrade as quickly or you know can be captured in a different substrate that you know
I've had some I can't remember what it was but way way back in the day like, you know early 2000s
I had a plant that I grew out and
Hated it. It was just like the flower was
Completely unpleasant, but then we eventually got around to processing some of it and some bubble hash and it made incredible
You know what now?
Might be in the realms of full melt sort of style and it was one of the first times that I saw like
holy shit, this bubble is just fully melting and
That that was like
Not a cultivar that I actually would have grown and smoked again had I you know
Had I just smoked the flowers and so I think the more that we get into these
Applications and breeding for these specific applications. We'll find that
We can capture them for their best end use
Right on
The emojis you guys are talking about are my favorite type of herb
So I'm gonna be looking out for anything you guys do put out on those for sure
Me too
OG I think that OG is definitely I don't think that it ever went anywhere, but I definitely think that it's going to have
a lot more market traction again and here before
Yeah, I believe the same thing as we get more legal every state that goes legal every time you're going to see a major influx
The staple lines like the Kim's the OG's and I know everyone's gonna hate me saying this but the blue dreams
the granddaddy purples the staples that have been here for decades because the people have heard about them they've wanted to sample them and
they haven't had access to them and as their
states open up and their
Their cities and their towns started having collectives that they can go to that's what they're gonna start to ask for
That's gonna become what the markets going to be selling them those and along with these new hype strains
Unless we as the readers start bringing back some of the stuff that people
Remember farther back right like everybody in YouTube here talking about cheeses and stuff of Colombians
If we don't start breeding for those we're all gonna get stuck smoking cookies, which isn't a bad thing
It's good herb, but it gets boring when it's the same thing
That's why I asked about what everybody's doing there because I know we all have our own style of breeding
We're all gonna take it in a different direction and we're all going to be good at it because of the experiences we brought to
Those and the reasons why we like we all like oh geez
But we all have a specific reason why we're diving into and why we like them myself. I love them, too
I grew up with them
I introduced him this year to a lot of my breeding with the space cheese mail since everybody's talking about cheese
I've got some cheese coming for you guys through my space cheese mail
And I've got the UK cheese cut on its way back to me so that I can do a back cross to her since
She is the grandmother to the line that's in there and I will testify that this cheese
The cheesiest
Frickin cultivar of cannabis that I've ever smelt that smells like funkiest cheese that you could think about
Alright now see I'm glad you said that brother cuz that's what I was gonna bring up when you guys were talking about
Fuck cuz I do need to get the clone to you
You're gonna be one of the only people that ends up with the space cheese from my selection
I've only released one pack of the f2 seeds, but I will be sending you a
Pack of the F2s along with one of the mothers that I want you to do some work with which we mind
We might need to do that during the springtime because it's getting pretty cold out here in Colorado
Yeah, I hear you brother, but yeah that space cheese girl she's a funky funky girl man she comes through I made her back in
Today there when I worked at the collective here
We had a patient that was in the process of moving and he thought he was moving across town
But he didn't have a way to hold the cut while he was moving. So he came to my partner's nephew
I've I've known this cat since he was three years old and
He he knew I worked at the club and he knew this cat knew me for a long time
So he asked him to come talk to me about housing his cut
So I go over to his house and we have a talk he tells me about how he's created this blue cheese
through a selection of DJ shorts blueberry seed line from the 90s and a
UK cheese cut that he had had at one time when he created that line is the only seed line he'd ever made we've been
growing that stuff
For like six or seven years, right?
Since he's moving he didn't want to lose this female that he had he didn't want to select through other stuff
Because it gave him everything he was after
medicinally flavor wise
Flower time it was his unicorn, right?
So he gives it to me and tells me that I can offer the herb in my club for medicine
Figured it'd be for other people so I tell him great he says I can breed with it
Just don't pass the cuttings out because he knew I was the clone guy in the area. So I agreed to these
Stipulations he gives it to me
I
Wait basically a year before this guy never shows back up and I go and talk to my partner and find out the guy had
Actually moved out of the state
So I end up having a cut that I can't get back to the cat in no way at that time
So basically it becomes my cut so I cross her to my angel
Which was my staple male breeder at the time and I create what I called blue cheese at the time
I never released our space cheese
So it's my space cush male angel cross to this blue cheese female that this guy created
I use this seed line to make my angel back cross number to the second back cross to my angel male. I've made
five different angel back crosses with different out crosses and I've done seven angel back crosses through this exact
Female this space cheese female that Lucas was talking about
She was the basis the angel back cross to and from there back crossed again to make back cross three back cross four back cross
five back cross six and back cross seven by each time selecting the
cheesiest phenotypes that I could and back crossing to the original
male angel to get those continued back crosses and
Over the time that became a line that I grow in my personal garden all the time
She's one that I show that fades out so beautifully with the orange and yellow anthocyanins
Very short cultivar finishes quickly extremely dense flowers
she has a
ripe
Berry and fermented cheese flavor that comes through and all the phenotypes
So when I did finally lose all my plants in 2017, I start breeding again
I started to select through that space cheese line
Because I wanted to bring it back again since she was the basis to all my back crosses
I knew that line extremely well, so I knew what I needed to be looking for. So I've selected two
Females and I use a male that I call. Mr
From under the space cheese male and that male I use this year to hit 30 different females
From those 30 females. I've had 10 of them go through testing
I've got some more that are we going out here
I've got a whole bunch of killer crosses that are coming some cross to the triangle cush
SFVOG dog walker Death Star
Topanga Canyon
La pure the fire OG the G cut Skywalker
Roberts Creek Congo
I've got some stuff that came to me from Dutch blooms that he passed me to do some breeding with there's the shishmoney cuddler
which uses the
Ethiopian shishmoney
Cross to the sky cuddler. That's the female side
I've used the Catholic school girl, which is a Girl Scout variant
He also passed me the black walk fruit and the black walk gold which are crosses to the black lime reserve from Jackson
Those are gonna be going through testing here very soon
I also did three different bat crosses to the space cheese male like Ryan
Chimera was bringing up earlier. You should always if you have the ability in your breeding projects
introduce the reoccurring parents that created them if you can or a sister phenotype because
The fact that you may find a magical phenotype you might get those
Homogeneous you're after in that pairing
It's always something that I've always done
So I've always introduced a sister for you know, a brother for you know, or the reoccurring parent and in my case it was usually angel
My male was something that I always reintroduced because of the fact that the males have a larger
megabase of genetic coding to pass there could be and there is
Genetic material that only will come from a male. So by introducing that to my crosses
I was trying to ensure that I had the widest
Gene pool from the gene type that I had been breeding with for so long and it was a way for me to understand
Visually what may be coming from these plants that I'm going to be breeding with and then which generation of my pop-up
I
Had done it with these plants for so many times
So then I take that space cheese
I've crossed it's all these crosses and you guys can see on dog love or on my Instagram
There's pictures of the testers that have been sending stuff in there's Jen's garden
We've got
Ganja farms, mr. Magpie. I'm not sure if he's still on here. He's doing some testing for me my partner rain, man
I've been sending stuff out to multiple people
to run in different
environments as well as in my
environments on some of these plants that I've done so that I can see the expressions that are gonna come up and so that I
can show you guys everything that you guys keep asking for which is
testing and
Show me what I'm going to see what I might be looking for. What kind of expressions will I find in my garden growing your genetics?
based on
Abiotic stress that I can't control. So like cheddar Bob was testing for me. I sent him the female and
the progeny that created it so that he could test them side by side and find out which
Traits he's seeing from the female. That was the mother
find out
The line very quickly that way he can find out traits that are being passed homogeneously from that girl based on
Seeing it in the mother in one garden and in the progeny in the other garden
I'm actually really excited that you're getting ready to receive that Exodus cut back
I know that we had talked before about that that the the Exodus cut that I have
Was the same one that Milo Yang used to create Big Buddha seed company
Which my understanding is
Was given to him
by Brett and Jackie that now live in
Amsterdam, but I met Brett
Which is also a friend that introduced me to miles
From we should taste good. I guess he was a Paonia cat at one time, but he was the creator of chisel
so I know the
the cheese line extremely well, I know that I
Actually have one currently growing right now where I took my UK cheese
Female that I had and then I crossed that times my UK cheese
crossed with my breeding og kush male and
And I literally lugged around a male plant the same way that people would lug around a female plant
Just because I used it for most of my breeding
Projects because I knew what to expect at least on one side every single time
in my mind at the time and
That's what I used to create a lot of things
So I have a lot of og crosses that I've used throughout the years
But if you'd be interested, I will actually send you a cut of the version that I have so you can compare it
And see if it would be something of interest to keep in the forever stable because I would like to get in some other people's
hands
Yeah, brother. Once I get this one I could return the same favor and do the same thing man
I'm completely in that same mindset where the plant needs to be saved, right?
I used to be in the mindset that I need to keep these I need to hoard them
I'm the only one that's gonna have I'll be able to do this with them and
Then I lost my life and all my plants at one point and when I came back the miracle of that
Situation was that the plant spoke to me again and told me that it needed to be put into other people's hands in one way
Or another so I'm 100% down for something like that. We need to trade we need to verify
We need to allow breeders to take what we have and make their own version of them
Because of the medicinal
Properties of this plant something that the next guy can make even in the smallest of garden chucked in the worst way could make the most
Miraculous plant if we just sit here hoarding it because we think we did something special with the next dude stuff
We're taking the shit way too seriously about that point. So yeah, I'd be a hundred percent into doing that for real
Well, it's important to be able to do that
and I know that I can actually attribute this 100% to Peter that
until I was dicking around on YouTube one day and found the future cannabis project and
You know
I didn't do anything social media related just because I still had either friends or acquaintances that were still
heavily entrenched in the black market and obviously
You guys all know how it goes that you know at one time, you know cultivars didn't leave certain circles and
That unless someone was in your group or someone was able to vouch for that person, you know, they weren't
Invited to even have access to any of those things. So
Future cannabis project has been a big eye-opener
For me as far as being able to connect with people talk with other people instead of just being involved in my own little world
doing my own little thing and
You know and then bitching that the fact that I don't have like-minded individuals
But I found that there's a whole bunch of them and they're all over the US
Not just the the so-called meccas of cannabis in the US
And I see that's where I feel like I try to
preserve something and seed form so everybody else can enjoy it that
Necessarily doesn't have access to it, you know
a lot of people might hate me for that but like
You know, I'm trying to get oh you kush breath and deceit for him
so people can grow up for themselves or you know certain cultivars that
necessarily aren't continued by certain
Breeders or this that and the other and I feel like you know
Trying to preserve certain things that are really awesome is definitely important and not necessarily everybody does it or I?
You know, I don't necessarily know but like I feel like being able to preserve something in seed form is definitely
important as far as the long term
longevity of
Preserving a cultivar, you know, like I feel like I've been trying to
You know source animal cookies and source
Oh, do you kush breath and you know just certain cultivars that I would love to try to kind of get into
Seed form essentially to be able to preserve them long term
Because they're just amazing smokes
That you know, it's not necessarily something everyone else is kind of looking at, you know, I'm just
Lately, I feel like I've just been trying to kind of preserve things to where
Everyone else is trying to cross
Everyone else is trying to cross
Everything on to the new white runs and you know, Gary Payton and this that and the other as far as new cultivars go
So I feel like for preservation of certain genetics are definitely important
They are important brother, but the problem with some of that is
Recreational legal cannabis comes and you have if you're going to be a breeder that stays afloat
you're forced to introduce these lines that
are being
Publicized that people know about that they're asking for and it takes away from that exact
thing that you're talking about which is why we all started breeding because of the passion and experiences we had but
The more legal it becomes the more the people want
Those cultivars they're reading about that are being publicized. I mean you go on google right now
And next thing, you know, you start seeing a list of the 50 strongest cannabis strains and those are the 50 they're asking for
So if you don't introduce your breeding stock to those you end up falling out of the market
And then the next thing, you know, you're just stuck back to breeding for only yourself
And if this is your livelihood
then
you're stuck
Like bankrupting yourself if you're only breeding for the experience and the love of the plant
That's a whole different story
but some of us that are only breeding to try to do this on a business side to and offer our
Experience if we don't put some of those in there all the time
it it
Screws our business up and that's also what makes this market stale
And because we end up all having to use some of those same cultivars that are being
Talked about the next thing, you know
People take those and cross them to like they take my cookie cross and their cookie cross and we introduce them
and
through bad selection start pulling out all the shitty cookie phenotypes because
They only bought 210 packs and didn't buy enough seeds to do a selection and through founders effect of bottleneck
Bad genetics because they just didn't understand breeding well enough. They just took some seeds they found and
Now they're selling them. They're passing a cut
Fucking everything up because of
fucked up laws through
Recreational cannabis man. That's one thing that puts chrome aside is
The fact that we all have to take in account the hype shit
Just so people will look at us right us going on shows like this and offering information isn't enough
To prove that we understand what we're doing and what we want to offer people the information that we share freely
That that doesn't sway a lot of people because they don't know about us like a lot of people
in different countries don't know anything about me or you or some of the other people that are on the show tonight because
they either don't have access to us or
We're not in a book. We didn't win a cup
right those things
Are that's kind of the negative side of the breeding with it. Uh, what's going on these days? That's just my opinion. Yeah
Unfortunately, so yeah because
yeah, a lot of the
people that just
Cross x to z that's the new upcoming stuff, you know
I definitely feel that compared to people that are passionate about like trying to do something
So I definitely can understand that
because like one of the better, uh
What will quote indica type plants that i've grown in the last decade was your baby was your uh monkey?
uh
jeans, uh
zoji
The passion that you put in that plant from the love that you had for two cats that you met online that you never knew
And a plant that came out of that made some
Those plants looked so much
Like uh the deep chunk. It's it's crazy man and the smoke that comes out of that. It's just hashy
Earthy
Wonderfulness man, it's a short flower time. It handled the heat in my area
Great, it didn't pick up any kind of mold issues in my area
I love those plants because they were like jurassic weed
It was like when it grew like those dude those families were the size of dinner plates
You're like whoa, this is from some other world like this is crazy hype stuff that comes from recreational
That would have never happened if you would have been forced to only breed 100%
the same
You used plants that nobody else was really fucking with and created a line
that is
magnificent in my mind and it's not because there's something in there that I had but because of the smoke the
Medicine that comes from that stuff is killer
But most people would have never fucked that line because they don't know my genetics that were in it
they might have knew what came from jackson and probably do but
When they saw the other side that didn't know me and you had just started they would have passed over that line
By passing that line over they've done themselves a disfavor because they just missed out on a line
That's highly medicinal finishes fast does everything a lot of people ask for
And it comes through two breeders that not a lot of people knew
But put their whole heart and soul into the breeding that they do
And through that made something that was great. It's a three-way dude
I mean the three of us met up and the chances of that happened were what a million and one
For real and we all meet up in the digital space the next thing, you know through jackson's breeding and keeping these old lines
up in the middle of nowhere and then meet me at
The cup and I pass him some seeds and pass you some seeds and then you take both the stuff you get from both
Of us and they're like i'm gonna make something great from these
And you did and it was based on the breeding that two other guys did and the passion that you had for them and the
selection made
Killer shit, man
That stuff was killer
I need to plant one of those actually
Well, you you need to get into those, uh, grape limeade black lime reserve crosses that made that knockout
All right, no, I got those too i'm about to crack in dude i'm about to crack into those those are some next level stuff
I want to fuck with that cat piss super silver haze. You gave me two and see what
I want to put those onto my uh haze for days or what I what i'm selected now is my totally haze
Which is the redwood cush f3
female across to the uh haze f3 male
See so I introduced a short flowering master cush plant to that haze to cut down on flower time
but see I needed I need to send you my goat haze number two because that
It's got the terpene profile that wood school columbia and jackson was talking about
But it's got the quicker flowering time of ghost train haze and she's about done in about 75 80 days
Um, so i'll probably need to send you some of those around springtime, but you'll you'll definitely
Love the profiles coming out
baby, nice nice
I'm, just amazed at the fact you guys are able to work in
new lines besides the other things that you're doing because I know for myself that like
um with the exception of a couple of breeders, I literally
um, you know i'm still
working on stuff that I have from like positronics and
Saga martha, so I can't pronounce that ever but um, you know, I have seeds that are
Health 15 20 years old that are still in the pack that I haven't even
Messed with and stuff that I always have wanted to play around with
But I know that at the end of the day I a big sucker for anything that is going to be tangy or citrusy
um, and obviously anything that's haze
You know
Again, it's just I I smell those and i'll just go directly to those and it's almost
Sad because I find myself not even wanting to try
a lot of the
Vogue cultivars because I know that they might have the aesthetics they might have tricone production and bag of pill
But when you smoke it, you know, it ends up just being a huge turd
100
That's colorado's market right now. Like it looks good
It you know everything else but it doesn't smell like anything. It doesn't smoke like anything. It tests like
32 okay great, but it doesn't get you high or it doesn't medicinally affect you
um, so that that that's where i've really come to learn that terpenes are the
secondary metabolite that is
huge as far as
Coming to produce the medicinal effects that you normally produce with
You know cannabis
And so when it comes to a lot of the recreational stuff here in colorado, it's not
You know, you'll get a really intense short kind of high in a sense
But then you know it drops off after 45 minutes to where?
You get a organic cultivar and it really lasts for a few hours
um
You know as far as like trying to shop i've ever tried to shop by my nose
Like if if it smells good, then that means, you know, somebody put the time into
Making, you know curing it out and making it, you know doing the process right compared to you know
It smells grassy, but looks good all highly pass
So aesthetics is not necessarily all that i'm shopping for i'm shopping for my nose
And if my nose tells me, you know, that smells good now, you know
It's good. Then i'm gonna try it but
If it looks good and doesn't smell good, then i'll probably pass
Well, I know that I have a real easy quantifier for whether or not I consider something good and that's whether or not
It tastes the way that it smells
And then if I smoke half of a joint and I set it down and I pick it up say maybe
Two days later and pick it up and I smoke it that it doesn't taste like dog ass that it actually still you know
Tastes like what it's supposed to get on top of that. I know that i'm very old school that you know
um because of covid i've been better about putting filters on but i'm very much a
Just straight paper and cannabis person
And uh, you know if I don't have resin all over my lips afterwards or on my teeth
Or yeah, it's on my lips where whenever I come home from work and I give my wife a kiss that you know
She's like, oh you got resin all over
and
That's quality in a nutshell, but I also know that someone that i'm actually really impressed with that's out of colorado
um, I think someone brought it up earlier is
Um, jeff g or what some would probably know is rasta jeff. Um from irie. Um,
you know, he uh
Is a a pretty solid guy as a whole. He used to be the head cultivator for one of my friends commercial projects
There in the springs
And uh, i've gained a a lot of respect for him
um
I know that he's someone that I would actually recommend as a breeder as well
And you i've heard a lot about his genetics. I personally have not smoked any of his cultivated
product
Um, but I definitely have confidence that he probably produces some good quality
medicine
I know his flagship cultivar is a cultivar name arise, which is
um golden goat to
shit day breaker, um that
um, I grew that outdoors of
I was in oklahoma just kind of dicking around with it and I popped one seed of it and
Was extremely impressed that it was testing
roughly around
um
31 thca so somewhere around 26 27 thc
um, the turps were over three percent which
you know for just being a a random plant that I just have in the backyard that i'm not really taking care of in like a
Professional setting or a medical setting, you know, I was extremely impressed with it. So, um, I have nothing but good things to say about that guy
Absolutely
And it's funny because I have a buddy that i'm getting a golden goat cut from
That is from his original stock. So
Definitely big shout out to uh, russ for jeff
Yep, I have that killer stuff
I have the the golden goat, uh bx1 that he uh first made of that golden goat
And what kind of profiles again, oh go ahead tony
I was just saying i've got s1s that a friend made of those and sent to me from that first stock that he made
um
Strong ass lemon can come out of some of those golden goats that i've seen
What kind of profiles are you uh getting out of those
chase
Out of what
which
Um just standard pretty much, uh, sweet island skunk, um terps at least the direction that I popped I
um, I haven't really grown out a lot of them to be able to
Say, you know, that's what the whole line kind of steer towards
But the ones that I popped were definitely your sweet island skunk leaning
Okay, i'm assuming that's kind of like a tropical kind of hawaiian island kind of I don't know
delicious smell
Yeah for me just show piney too in there
I don't know. I think for me golden goat is one of my favorite, uh concentrates
i'm not real big on the concentrates because you know, I don't like
Having my lungs feeling like they're pancake together where
you know, I need a pry bar to be able to open my lungs back up and uh
Um at the same time I I still will do it but i'm more of a an old-fashioned joint person myself
Fair enough
Any other questions i'm trying to read through youtube in case I see something on there
Anybody on youtube here guys got a question for anybody on the panel specific?
Uh while we're waiting I was just going to get back to
some of what was talked about a little bit ago and just kind of the
The economics of the seed industry has been really, you know
It's been a contentious and fraught
terrain
Pretty much since its inception going back to the 80s
and
you know, it's
It's definitely you can track the different camps and the different, you know
conflicts that have emerged over the years between the different people and
folks who have had different
ideas and machinations on how to sort of like
maximize or corner the seed market over the years
And I think that we're in a really unique time that
you know
there's definitely a lot of drawbacks, but we're also at a time when
If you're a seed maker and you work with different licensed farms and you've got your genetics in metric
you're able to operate on a level that's just
You know, it's
Unparalleled compared to what we've been able to do under prohibition
and while it's few and far between and it's a completely fucked up situation in terms of the way that
Metric has been rolled out and regulations have been rolled out
across the country and internationally
But california has really figured out how to screw things up uniquely well
and uh
So there's a situation where even though we've got completely fucked up regulations, we also have a situation where
people like dan
jackson
Other folks who are in the california rec system are able to grow plants on a scale that they've never been able to grow before
They're able to do selections on a scale that they've never been able to do before
That creates a lot of different benefits for breeding programs
And so that's a good thing it also because they're
They work somewhat cooperatively with other people and like, you know
They bring genetics into their scene and work with other growers and breeders and get their genetics into other breeders situations
They really kind of spread the wealth and created possibility situations
it was kind of talked about at the end of last week's show when bam came on here, but like
Figuring out strategies for getting breeders
to
Go from the sort of traditional
black market world that we've all come from
And transition into the commercial world in ways that actually build value for and retain value for the breeders
it's not just a
one-way street where you know, we provide the genetics or people who have genetics of value provide those to
The different cultivators it's instead a
long-term relationship where
the breeder and the cultivators work together to develop cultivars that are unique and special to those
individual licensed operators that are then able to
use those and
There's you know, lots of different
strategies and plans that people talk about for how they maintain their
Proprietary sort of genetics and how they roll those out and monetize those
But that's something that
you know
10 years ago five years ago
Really was just at its most
you know
Rudimentary form and now we're really seeing these things take hold. We're seeing different breeders get their populations grown at scale
Bam did that huge haze grow?
And so there's different things like this that I think are like unique opportunities
I also think the subject that we're talking about is really applicable because
The vast majority of international seed sales are autos and femmes and so, you know, like breeding and
Directing seeds sales towards those, you know towards the international market requires
International markets demands which are largely for those types of seeds and that's something that
You know in America. We were largely resistant to for
quite a while there was a lot of
A lot of resistance to adopting autos in cultivation and in breeding programs and there's been
You know a long-standing
conflict and you know hesitancy
Conflict and you know hesitancy to adopt femmes and so I just think that it's
Now more than ever we're operating in a terrain that allows people to kind of have a foot in both camps
Navigate this very uneasy
rocky terrain of regulations while still producing seeds
In
You know closets and or backyards and the fact that people are able to do that and then get their work
into the you know
Licensed scene is something that is a unique opportunity for a lot of people and
You know tony I would really encourage you to to the extent that I can try and help or facilitate it like getting your work
grown at scale
in commercial facilities with either nurseries or with
Licensed cultivators is something that
You know, it's it's an opportunity that we didn't have before
and then
Also the fact that we have these online platforms through future cannabis project through instagram through direct market like
People are just getting out and doing it and creating brands
and moving seeds and
It's one of those things where unfortunately, you know, it's
It's caveat emptor out there and buyer beware
So, you know, you got to do your due diligence. You got to do your research you got to
It's best to get to know people and get to know the breeders
It's really cool to hear the relationship that's developed between you guys lucas and uh
And tony and with jackson and you know, that was something that the events, you know, they're starting to happen again, but like
being able to go to the emerald cup for years being able to go to different there was like the
The spring kickoff and stuff like that and the uh, the different farmers markets at area 101
Like those were events where we got to get together
You got to meet breeders that you maybe only knew as like
Instagram or like facebook people, but then you were there and you were interacting with them
and that's something that
you know
definitely to the extent that you're able to take advantage of it and
To the extent that we're able to find ways to get the breeders who have traditionally been at those events who have been producing
in breeding genetics for years
Into the rec market and you know
making that transition
As fucked up as it is and as unpleasant as operating in metric can be is something that we need to try and do
Yeah, those events are killer. Thanks for what we have these days
Like the regenerative conference that's going to be coming up here
You'll be able to talk to breeders that are there and just peels people's brain back about
Everything you want to know about what they're producing so
Or if you go to the emerald cup, that's also going to be coming up
Don't just go there to stare at the booths and should take that time
To wait in line as long as you have to to ask that man or that woman or that group that's been breeding
Specific stuff that you're after the questions that you can't find in a magazine or an instagram post
Ask them about phenotype expressions ask them about how they uh tested the line out find out
Does the plant like water or not find it from the breeder and not just from their post find out if the information they're giving
you is uh, correct from
You can read body language, man
I've I won't tell you the names of some of the breeders that i've ran into it personally that when asked questions about stuff
they had
Just end up with a blank stare on their face and couldn't explain anything about what they were doing other than it's here on the table
Right, they're for you and far between but they're out there
so uh
These events you go to them and you find out who you want to support
You might find out that a dude that you did not like online
Has a vibe in person that just is what you've been looking for right and that vibe
Translates into his breeding and that breeding comes across and you're growing
And you're growing ends up coming across in your attitude and a whole snowball comes from
Interaction with someone on a level that you weren't able to do before
And then again, like you said getting my stuff into a commercial facility on scale, man
I've been able to do that since the 215 days when we were able to do like 99 plants at a time and I can put
My stuff into multiple gardens. It's invaluable information for breeders to get that kind of feedback
outliers
medicinal properties of different genotypes found in that line
the phenotypical expressions that are going to show up in
a room that's
Not only just dialed in but when people are tracking numbers
That are used to uh do baselines that something has to fit into
These are things that are great to be able to uh equate your breeding into
uh being able to put that into market value because that's what's coming for breeders and we're doing this for commercial we have to
Be able to understand what a certain cultivar is going to be able to do people want to extract
but like you had said earlier in the
The show sometimes a plant that you grow in one
Environment even it's that exact same cut you would take it to another place and it does not produce the same way
You're not be able to extract the same stuff that you're doing before
So that's where passing the information that you know about the line
The breeding that you've done the testing that it's went through the information that you can pass to those growers
on
Shows like this and on instagram and on facebook is invaluable to what's coming
In the future with this plant because cannabis is the new green revolution. It's like the industrial revolution, but it's 10 times larger
Everything that we can look around in our room right now can be replaced with cannabis except for our own flesh and blood
And eventually they're going to try to make a cyborg that's going to retain our memory inside a body built by him
So they might even replace us with it if they can get that damn thing to smoke weed
so
this this plant is uh
Invaluable with the future that's coming and if we don't understand how to use it
We're going to be left out in the cold we can't just be the bottom end consumer of a plant
All the time. We can't just be a slave to mary jane. That's where the knowledge that each one of us passing through experience and through
learning
Is invaluable to each one of us about everything I learned from you guys tonight
People in the comments is going to send me in a new direction to learn something brand new
That's what these things are great for
I think it's all about transparency moving forward
And you know showing people the good the bad and the ugly and not necessarily what is instagram worthy
I know that uh, you know, I I look at my instagram and the posts that I I put on there
I'm, just like man compared to some of these other people, you know, it's like i'm not spending, you know
Thousands upon thousands of dollars to have super nice filters to be able to make my shots look really really nice
But I know that people are and I think that there's a lot of chest beating
that goes on and a lot of people that are quick to just uh,
You know take someone else's work and just put it in a different package and you know
Make it pretty and say hey, you know, I have just reinvented the wheel
When in reality, you know, they're just pushing someone else's work and I find that more common
Than not especially in a new state
Where you have new people entering the market, um, oklahoma, for example, just because again no barriers to entry
Um, you know, everyone's a master grower here, but yet when I ask them where they're from or where they work
Um, or you know how many lights or you know, how big of an operation they have? Well, oh
This is my first one or you know, blah blah, you know for me
I don't understand why people do that because everyone has to start somewhere. Um,
You know, I I trevor had sent me some stuff that I was just like wow
This is a godsend information wise and I really have a lot of respect for
everyone that was been on this panel the last few weeks because
um, you know, i'm someone that's completely against feminized stuff I I think that you know, it's
A shortcut to be able to cut
out the hard work that it actually takes to breed but you guys are starting to slowly steer me into
a
World where i'm actually at least considering it. So
You know change is always good and I look at it regardless of what you do in life
That you're either growing or you're dying. There's no such thing as staying stagnant
Yeah, I on the reversal side of stuff just look to any other plant besides cannabis on how
They go about offering up an f1 or the clone to plants that are passed to us like the tomatoes
That are out there all the air varieties that are passed to us at the stores that we go to
um, eventually they make an f1 and reverse it if they have to and then pass us all the clones of those or the
Ornamentals that we're all after so they can get that same expression out of everything
That's how they go about offering those plants or through auto flower breeding without using reversals we end up with a very
Heterozygous line that can go from being a photo period to an auto flower
with varying turps varying, uh
color profiles different structures and heights
Almost nothing
Comes across as homozygous because of the heterozygous trait of the auto flower
That's kind of why it ends up getting the translation of rubble
Well when you go to try to breed it because the photo periods don't contain the same
Heterozygous traits as those plants because they've been segregated so much
You don't get very good crosses from them on the first time
so until you start to breed into
an f2 and f3 and then
Dig through those f3s to find the expression you're looking for and reverse it into an f4
Or go to f4 to an f5 through a female
Do you offer a stabilized version of the auto flower that you're after with the terpene profile that you're looking for?
otherwise, you just open up the gene pool to wider and wider phenotype expressions because
They don't share like alleles because of how far apart they actually are
so not
Feminized breeding isn't always going to be
uh the shortcut you're looking for but sometimes it's
The method that's needed to be took to get to an end project that you're after and if you look towards nature
even with cannabis we all start to
find that these elites that we've all
Grown up with at people my age all start to find out that a lot of these came through what we understand to be
asexual
replication of a specific
plant
And then we ended up all breeding with them when we end up coming out of those we find out that that thing isn't offering
any worse
genotypes
It's just as stable as any other regular breeding project because in reality those plants
in the past came through
regular
breeding
male to female right like
Chimera brought up earlier here. That's how cannabis breeds, right? It needs to
It's indifferent on how it's doing this. It needs to have a male path to a female or there has to be some form of
Pollen past even if it is a female that had
morphodite expressions or there was some sway of
hormones from environmental issues that plants going to reproduce through pollen to
Anomaly, that's just how it works
And it does not matter where that grain of pollen came from that plant
Does it's kind of like synthetic and organic right?
The ions and ion to the plant the cannabis plant doesn't care where that pollen came from
It only cares about the genetic combination
That it offered when the two plants pass half of their
gene type
To the progeny that's that's where the magic or the accident happens
It's not the fact that you use the female that you reverse to breed
It's the fact that that females
Genes when crossed to this other plant combined in a very
Bad fashion or an unwanted fashion. So it had nothing to do with it being a female plant that you reversed
It just had to do with the fact that these genes
Did not want to be combined. It just wasn't going to work
So he comes down to in nature that plant would have called itself and never would happen
or you end up getting plants that are very
Hey is a very famous line right in nature, they never would have met they're from extreme different environments
But when we take them and breed them together, we end up with something that's great
And then from there people go and breed them out
We found out you can take those and reverse them and come out with killer stuff
You can hit them to reverse lines and nothing happens to them
This is a way to see without even our own
Experience through other breeders that the stuff we're working with doesn't carry those traits that we're afraid are going to show up
Right, so you can see the guy like me a guy like gene a guy like lucas all working with a kim
Right or black line reserve and find out that what's coming out of our breeding project using different males unrelated
Or when we reverse them isn't showing
What everybody's afraid is going to come out of these crosses these homophodites that everyone's scared of
Because it's the environment
And the genes that are causing expression that we're scared of it's not just the genes. It's not just the environment
So as growers, we just have to be hip to selection and calling a plant
We can't be afraid that we're going to get a homophodite because this plant
has
These traits it's going to show males females and homophodites
That's just what's in cannabis and no matter what amount of breeding we do we're going to get homophodites
No matter what amount of breeding we do we're not going to get rid of all those in our lives be it regular breeding
or through fem breeding back crossing
f-generations
the gene pool of cannabis
Originally contained this and it's in there no matter how many times you breed
some
Tangy to a granddaddy purple or a haze to a haze
You're not going to fully remove those traits in there and the environment eventually is going to cue them to happen
We don't know
What they could be could be heat
Could be a hormone that we sprayed on the plant could be something in the soil that's causing a hormone production through the enzymes
That are being excreted in the bacteria
There's all kinds of actions that could cause a homophodite to show up in the womb
It had nothing to do with the breeder
the genetics
Are none of them were the singular cause of need to say right? It's a accumulation of all of those happening
Is that sure well I think what for me kind of got me off to a sour taste in my mouth in regards to feminized
Seeds is when they first came out
I was touring commercial properties that were outdoors that were doing larger plant counts and they were having
intersex issues and
You know for me, you know
That they didn't know where this came from and I was just like man, you know, there's no such thing as 100% in cannabis
So you still have to walk your rows? You still have to do all those things?
So it was just that false sense of security that people are like, okay if I plant these seeds
I don't have to worry about any intersex issues
I don't have to worry about any males and then whenever they have one of those
But at the same time I know that when I was looking at those
It's whenever you know that technology was first kind of being introduced into cannabis and you were starting to kind of see seeds that were
Being sold that were feminized
Um, and then once you know that happened, I was just like well, fuck that, you know
I'm done with messing with these and then you know, however many years later, you know, we're having this conversation now
but you know, that's originally what got me to to have that kind of belief system because that's what I
Experienced and it was not just
One commercial operation. It wasn't just one state. It wasn't just one grower
It was you know multiple times experiencing these things so
You know, it just made me realize that you know, you always have to be open to
the fact that science does change that you know cannabis does inherently change as an industry that
You know what was cool
Um might not be cool next year, but it will be cool. Maybe three five ten years down the road. So it's important that
We don't put ourselves into a box and cross everything with girl scout cookies cross everything with runs where
you know the gene pool is
kind of
In a direction that is
non-conducive to diversity
Which I think we all can say that we definitely like the subjectiveness and the diversity when it comes to cannabis
Well, I understand I feel you brother but um
I'm just trying to dispel the uh
People's fear of female plants, that's why I was trying to use other plants like uh
gynosis cucumbers that are created
solely for the purpose of
Creating a plant that creates more flowers and on the female sides which actually produce a fruit
then
As a stamina flower that's only going to produce pollen that isn't commercially viable in the system, right?
So there's reasoning behind why some people use it it's not always
The reason or the go-to reason that was my only um point to having that so you end up if you were trying to make a
gynosis line
Then feminizing is the only way to go about it with cannabis from what we know
and that's they do that with other plants and makes
many examples from watermelons to
cucumbers tomatoes there there's a reason they will take a plant and
And
Make it a feminized line for specific reasons
So in the early days a lot of reasons were people like I said, they were using bad information
They were using bad selection because if you're going to go to a commercial setup and you're going to dig through feminized seeds
You need to dig through a large population first to find what you're after if you're looking for a plant to produce cbd thc
High terpenes flavonoids you have to do a selection for that
So now you can introduce a clone version of that plant into your system only you don't want a seed line through there
Feminized or regular or you're going to end up with such a wide phenotypical selection out of there
even through a true breeding line, which is going to give you a genotype of
Multiple expressions
So even the truest breeding line no matter what is going to give you four different phenotypical expressions out of that line
Or genotypical expressions i'm sorry the phenotypes even wider and that's that's just how it is
If you don't dig through those and then introduce what you're after
You're already hurting yourself. So in the early days
They just thought it was going to be easier to introduce a seed to the system
And we're going to run all of these and we already know in the regular seeds if you do that
You're going to find shitty plants. You're going to find hermaphrodites
You're going to find outliers that are going to be spectacular
And that happens to regulars or fems
So it all comes down to the knowledge that we had at a specific time in the early days of feminization
nobody was sharing anything online because that stuff was golden it was just like
uh selling cuts for ten thousand dollars back in the day, we we knew that the amount of money a person was going to use
with that information
and their uh
ability to access that information
Were so small that people were charging for it now we can give it out for free
That's that's the great part. So be able to give both sides of that, uh argument
and to be able to talk openly about it is great like because I understand what you're saying I hated uh,
The idea of introducing feminized the seedlings to anything back in the day until I started to think about it the same way
How nature's been?
Introducing for so long and we don't have this wild population or this large population of hermaphrodites
Just showing up in anybody's breeding
and cannabis has been doing this for
Millennia before man even showed up then when we did show up
We didn't even mess it up so bad that all of a sudden
Every time our third breeding project just shows up as complete junk, right?
They're always great big plants in our populations. No matter what you just have to dig through
Yeah
Trevor just quickly before
I'm gonna just because I gotta run back and do I gotta take care of my three-year-old. Uh,
uh
I'm gonna read the question say what you're gonna say and then if you guys can tackle these ones from the youtube are any breeders
On the panel working on ibls or cultivars that breed true for individual traits
And then there was a feminized question. Uh, will you get male and female seeds from pollinate pollinating a feminized plant?
So say whatever you're gonna say and then if you guys can hit that stuff
Um, yeah, I was just gonna give some context and background. Um, when fem lines were
On the film
Yeah, sorry just uh
So when fem lines were first introduced they were first introduced by dutch passions
and dutch passions
Did not produce particularly good feminized seeds they
Admit that they used. Um
What's been referred to as?
Rotalization, I believe soma talks about it and it's essentially
taking plants past their normal flowering time and stressing them to force them to herm and then
getting pollen from those
herms
And making seeds with that. Um
It was a really bad technique and not
There was a lot of um
Commercial, you know reaction to early fem lines was to the fact that um
dutch passion released unstable herm seeds, um
Then online forums there was a lot of discussions a lot of mention has been made of hibe
hibe has
He was the first person to produce the a commercial. Um
Reversal spray. He also was the first person to really start
He pulled up the h
Y mohan ram study from 1982. He found the recipe for sts. He found a whole bunch of other things
He also had found information regarding
a reversal of cucumbers
and he had done all of this research and kind of
According to him if you read some of his older post had figured all of this out independently
and then went back and
Looked through the research and confirmed his own findings
um after he found the mohan ram papers, so he had already
um
Done work with reversals figured out the process
And then gone back and done research and found out that other people had done similar research and you know
Demonstrated it through scientific white papers
Um, he also then started sharing those in online forums and online on the online community
um, there was controversy there was a number of other people who
um
Didn't like the fact that he was making a commercial spray and found the mohan ram papers and started posting them everywhere
um
There was a lot of like, you know back and forth between the different camps on that side
And then there was also the back crossers
um, so there was a lot of like
And when I say the back crossers i'm referring to people like vic high mr. Soul and different people who?
Advocated using back crossing as and maintaining the
y chromosome of the male in the
breeding program and the benefits of that as a
um
you know something that
They were essentially arguing that
We don't know what's on the y chromosome but in the absence of like
Knowing if there's something good or not, let's just not get rid of it. Um, the response from people like hybrid and
um
and
chimera was often that like obviously open pollination and
large
Population breeding should be done first to capture all of the allele frequency in the population
that should be stored and periodically brought out and
Increased in large populations just to maintain the base frequency
of the alleles and
that after that you should do
intensive selective breeding with the best
individual plants and that nothing is actually lost or
There aren't genetic
Negative genetic consequences
Just through selfing itself
and or through gynoscious breeding in and of itself and
I think that chimera makes a lot of really good points. And if you look into plant breeding
and you read about how
you know 90% of
crop species or plant species out there are
Minocious and so they're selfing species
And what happens in selfing species is that they very quickly
eliminate
the
undesirable or deleterious alleles that arise through homozygosity
so if there are gene combinations that are bad for the population
they
Don't reproduce and get eliminated from the population
And so selfing plants have this ability to
there's a
Very there's a specific term in the scientific literature for it that I can't think of off the top of my head
But essentially they're able to purge or clean their genomes
whereas
hybridizers or obligate crossers like cannabis aren't able to do that. So when we do selfing and make you know
fem
seeds through selfing specifically
we're going to produce a lot of
undesirable outcomes just through inbreeding depression that emerges from the process of taking
Undesirable gene pairs and fixing them into a homozygous state
Doing that is technically a good thing
because
Even though it produces those bad outcomes within that population
And that's obviously not a plant you're going to select for or
Traits that you're hopefully going to select for ideally you'll be eliminating those from the population
And you'll be able to very quickly
Get rid of those undesirable
outcomes gene combinations that is and fix desirable gene combinations
And by doing that you're going to rapidly increase your prepotency
Or the homozygosity for favorable alleles within the population
And doing that using intensive selection
for instance for all the traits that we desire
And intensive selection against all of the traits that we don't desire like intersexual traits
You'll actually produce better genetic gains and this is just like math like, uh, tony. Um,
I I can't remember what show it was on but I saw you in the comment section on a future cannabis project
Not too long ago and you said breeding is math
and so
If ryan were up here chimera were talking about this. He would be able to say and like
Break this down in a way that very clearly articulates and demonstrates how this process works scientifically
And on a molecular level, but essentially what we're doing is we're purging undesirable
Gene combinations when we're doing this type of inbreeding
and
so
And yeah, it's going to happen much more quickly
And you're going to be able to do much
better selection
In your breeding program just by using these techniques
And while there were bad outcomes in terms of like the early dutch passion
Uh
experiments in
Rotorization or whatever it's called. Um, those are not like
representative of the actual tech and
It was very quickly
surpassed by sts and these sort of
you know
hybes
His spray is not just sts. I believe it has ga and a number of other gibberellic acid. Um,
a number of different
Up regulators and down regulators for different hormones and so
The whole literature if you go into it you I posted every h y mohan ram paper on ig
There's also a really good
old paper by
Um a woman named gallich or galloch
G a l o c h I believe where she exposed
All sorts of plant growth regulators or hormones like ga's
Uh
Ethylene blockers
Ethylene's all sorts of different things. She like the whole gamut
She exposed both male and female plants and then tracked their response through flower. Um
That's really the literature that's out there. You can look at that and
You know, it's pretty clear that
From a scientific perspective as long as you're maintaining
males in populations in a base open
Open pollination population before doing intensive selfing
You're not causing any genetic harm and you're actually going to
Have greater success of selection
Um and then peter had asked some questions and
Oh, sorry. No, did you catch those tony? I was I well I just uh posted uh
Links to the gallich paper and to the mohan ram stuff in the youtube
I just wanted to let people know in case they're not paying attention to what i'm posting in there
Where are you posting that at tony in the youtube comments?
um
Will you uh, like dm me that stuff or whatever you're doing? I guess whenever we're done with this if you don't mind
um, if anybody
Um has the folder that i've shared it's in the um
Sexual determine or sex determinism
folder, um, you can either like
type that into the
search bar or um
Find it in the cannabis text area
But it has literally every one of these papers. Um
And
Yeah, uh, but do we anybody know what the questions were? I think it was um
um
oh, is anybody making ibls or
breeding for
Specific true traits. I think that like anybody who's breeding for high thc is breeding for
a true trait like we've pretty well fixed and
Established that trait and people continue to breed for it. So
if you're trying to breed for
30 thc like pretty much every commercial farm wants people to breed for because that's all their
Distributors will buy right now. Um
Yeah, then you're breeding for a true trait but that that's been a
mass
collective project that's been undertaken by everybody who's been selecting cannabis for the last 30 years and
creating a very uh, you know
Linear increase it seems in thc percentages. Um
Other than that i've done
every year that I breed I try to do something where I
Increase something and keep it pure. So
You know, it's been mentioned. Uh
By everybody, you know, tony ryan different people when pollen's flying it's nice to hit everybody that you can
So I hit all the ogs that I have
Uh, I hit the tk. I hit josh d's og. I hit uh, lem's og I hit
A couple other I mean like I got every og I could get my hands on and hit the tk m10 to that just to
You know back cross into that og population
and
Um, we also took uh, the ranch gave me some pina f4 pollen
And so I hit my pina f4s with his pollen. So we made some pina f5s
I made f2s of all the tk m10s. Well, not all of them all the ones that I was selecting for
um
And so yeah and like in other years i've also done with the 88 g13 hash plant i've done
Multiple increases with that over the last couple years. So
i've
You know
It came to me I believe as an f4. I'm not entirely sure. Um
What f gen it came to me as but i've done two increases subsequently
And i've also outcrossed that with things that are like f4 or greater. Um
Also made a sky cuddler f4s this year out of the
The big population that bam selected from
so
Yeah, every year I try to progress different lines
That I have that are already deep into their f gens at least one generation
I think there's also a double-edged sword in regards to
Breeders that are breeding for high thc because
Unfortunately, that's also what the processing market wants. Um, I know that most processors
you know are only hunting for things that are going to
be high in thc because
You know once they start making concentrates of any form
You know those things matter
especially when
people are using shit material we all you know can talk about the
Discrepancies that we all have with color mediation columns
and processing because it's one thing to
Refine something for the sake of refining versus it's another thing to refine because you're trying to clean up shit
Which you know sometimes people just don't grow material that is worthy to be able to go to the public and sometimes
You know, I hate to tell people this that you just made a a really nice compost or you made a nice edible or you made
Something else but as far as a smokable flower
It's not necessarily the case all the time
For me, let's see. I've been
Beginning a project to start to breed for some medicinal
Traits that I know are found in my mud bone line and in the bubble kush the 98 bubba
I'm doing i'm working on a back cross to the bubba through my mud bone line male
That I shifted out of 50 seeds this year
I picked a male and a female through my mud bone line to do an f2
To do a back cross to the bubba
The mud bone line is a line that when I worked at my collective that I
Not my collective the collective I worked at and was running
I had patients there that had ms that used to reply
That that plant was the best plant they'd ever found to help them with that
So we ran it through some medicinal trials there and found out that it was very effective for that
So i'm trying to breed and retain that trade along with some of the other
visual traits of the plant structure density
short fast flowering
easy to clone
the terpene profile i'm after from that plant would be a
chocolate earthy
Almost a mushroom compost back node on it
And that's what i'm looking for when I get the breeding done with that
So i'll be in i'll be making seeds through there and i'll be sending those out to testers to find out
How they work with that i've already been getting to line up some testers that actually have ms or other neurological diseases
that if they don't grow themselves, they have a
A medicine provider that they can give the seeds to that they can introduce into their system and then start to offer that person
that
plant in a medicine form of either a concentrate or in flour or however, they ingest it and edible whatever it be
And find out if it's retained any of those medicinal properties for me. That's how I go about it. So i'm going to end up with
Probably about 10 different people that have ms
Or another condition or similar to it a nerve condition that can report back
Whether or not that plant works
That's how i'll be going about doing that that project started this year with selection of the male and female
and is about to begin with the uh
I'm going to grow the females out inside one more time to make sure that I get what i'm after
Since I already ran them outside and then i'm going to begin the breeding with that
I'll throw pollen on the females with the male
And then I will introduce those to my testers to see how those start coming out from the open population
I know that you guys are extremely lucky that I know that i've brought this up to peter and i've talked to chad
About this but just being able to secure
quality testers
Is a challenge in itself
um
I I know that I have had
issues with
um giving people seeds and then either not growing them out because they
You know are just vaulting them or they have other stuff going on
or they don't have the
wherewithal to be able to
actually grow those to
The the level that they need to be grown so that way you can actually pull real data
Um and not someone that's you know, just doing it casually that is doing it with the
intent and
And purpose versus just growing out a random
package of seeds
Um, so yeah, and then the other question, um
I think it was a question about whether or not you if you breed
with a femme it if
Will whether or not it will produce male or female offspring, um that depends, uh
As has been mentioned
Male offspring or phenotypically male offspring can be produced through female female breeding
even though there is no y chromosome this is because of
the weird autosomal
traits that
Are associated with male flower, uh
production
um
this
There's a lot of really good papers that have come out on this recently that have looked into the phenomenon the different genes that are involved
with the
um with female flower expression in um
With male flower expression in female plants or xx chromosome plants
um
so
There are anomalies such as that that will arise
Regardless of you know the breeding program
if you're using
male pollen, then you're
It's no different. You're not like
The fact that you have an s1 and you're now breeding it with a male pollen source
The offspring are going to be male and female. They're not going to be skewed. Um
It's very rare. There are some reports. Um
I know that uh, david watson says that the haze has some skewed offspring
um something like 75
percent female to 25 male
uh, i've heard chimera reference that before and that it's a you know
That is an anomaly that can't really be explained. Uh, um
But generally speaking you're gonna see roughly 50 50
Offspring in any male female cross
Yeah, I can probably back that up in my haze for days i've seen about 75 female to male in that line
Um, even through all everybody that's grown and reported back to me
Only a few people have found higher numbers than that
And also we should all try to get over the fact that feminized plant
If no one told you it was created
Through feminization techniques of uh
Good practices like sts or even collodial silver. I'm not talking
Rodeliazation which is a very terrible technique which basically ensures you're picking a homorphodite to pass on its uh traits
if you use
sound techniques
That plant that's produced from that seed stock is no different than if you would have used a male other than the fact that
It didn't have a chance to ever produce a y chromosome in the progeny
If you would have never been told that that plant was feminized you would have never known that
You would have introduced it to it because you like the cannabis you like the profile it gave the medicinal quality
It was giving you the effect
how fast it finished and
It's a great plant it's beautiful
Until someone entered the word feminized did people in the cannabis communities start getting scared of breeding because
most of us
Never understood anything about breeding any type of plant
until it came to a specific cultivar or a situation where we needed a plant that we came across to
Help us with a condition or someone else with a condition and then we start trying to figure out. How do we replicate that?
and
We replicate that as close as possible to feminization
or
uh
Reducing the illegal frequency of the traits that we're after
which is extremely hard through
Pairing a male to a female since you have plants passing 50 percent of the genetic coding
when you breed if you use a male and a female the chance of a
Separate male
Genotype selected out of a gene pool pairing up exactly to a female genotype from that gene pool
Based on the phenotypic expressions that you see
Isn't going to be as successful as if you would have taken that female that gave you the effects you were already after and
Put her on herself through
uh
Asexual
Breeding this is going to give you an allele frequency increase of the traits that you're after
and begin to reduce some of the bad traits through selective breeding if you do your
Uh your selection correct and on a large enough scale not through 10 seeds
You're not going to find all the traits you're looking for in the cultivars you want in a 10 pack of seeds
You're just going to find good weed
So if you're going to start to breed for specific traits that you're after
You need to start to dig far into that genotype to make sure what you're picking
is going to replicate
those
Genes you're after you need to increase the allele frequency of the homogenous traits you're after
And try to get rid of those delirious traits that are
Basically a train wreck in your breeding they could be great traits for somebody else, but you're not after them
so to get rid of the ones that you're
not after
you reverse that plant on itself and
Increase the homogenous traits you're after by a selection you start to dig through
a thousand phenotype thousand genotypes to the gene pool you did by popping a thousand seeds and now you find
Five plants in there that are all representative of the traits that you were looking for in the medicinal side
But each one of them has a different structure on its uh plant or on its uh itself, right?
So now you've got a way to grow a tall plant a short plant a fast flowering plant
They all retain those medicinal qualities you were after because they all have homogenous traits for those because the alleles form are passing
true breeding
In that line now you pass those to other females or other males that
Have some of those traits and you start to increase the allele frequencies for the traits you're after
That's when you start to introduce those in a regular seed form
But it only happens once you remove those through breeding and it's a lot easier to do that with the feminization
of a particular
Genotype that one plant that you found that does what you're after
If you're trying to open up a gene pool, then that would be the wrong way to go
You would want to use regular males and use as many as possible from that line and as many females that way
the gene pool you're after
Gets as wide as possible to offer you as many of the traits you're after
that's what the
Open pollination of regular plants is going to be the best for
So like I said again breeding you have to decide what you're doing
And then go for it the most efficient way that you can do it through the plants that you have in your experience
So we have to quit being scared of the feminized plant if no one told you it was how would you know that it was?
Um
on that point oregon cbd produced a paper back in I think
2017 um
It's called feminized seeds and the ethics of cannabis farming oregon cbd
Yeah
2017 um
And if they talk about field trials and i've had discussions with uh
One of the crawford brothers i'm not sure which one
um
you know on instagram over the years on the subject and
They found that essentially one in every 2 000 plants be it a seed or a
feminized seed or a clone, um will have
you'll have
one incidence of hermaphroditic tendencies or expression in
One out of every 2 000 plants so
that's
And that doesn't matter if it's from clone or from seed
And this just has to do with
essentially the numbers game that
there is
environmental factors that because of the
You know, tony was going over a bunch of them earlier. There's
nutrient based factors
There's light based factors. There's temperature based factors. All of these can induce hermaphroditic
expression
But there's also things like mutilation like if a plant gets cut up or like
Uh in the example that oregon cbd gives uh
the specific plant that hermed or one of them was
uh chewed on by rabbit it there was a
water leak that it got over watered
And a flashlight was like flashed on it a couple of times during night at during flower
those environmental factors
pretty like those have actually been studied and if you look back at like
some of the earliest um studies in cannabis look into
sex determinism and
there was um
A guy named schaefer, I believe he was a um, a botanist or a
professor out of university of or ohio
is where he worked and
He did experiments mutilating the plant. Um, fucking with the different with its light cycle
and
Demonstrate and growing in winter conditions and demonstrated that all of these different variables could produce
um hermaphroditic expressions
um
so yeah, there's a there's a lot of literature on this stuff and
There's you're not going to be able to eliminate
Herms simply by relying on non-feminized seeds
Growing clones even clones that have been demonstrated to be stable and not produce herms in
Numerous environments when exposed to the right pressures
will inevitably produce hermaphroditic expression and so
part of that's just a cultural practices and you know how you actually go about cultivating and whether or not
these environmental
variables end up
you know
Resulting in hermaphroditic expression in your garden
um, we've gotten
Very good at controlling them and are getting much better all the time. Um,
so
that's one of the things like there's hope in terms of
breeding away from hermaphroditic expressions
but it's not a it's not going to eliminate the
Possibility for herms
It's just it's built into the plant's
genetic structure and how it responds to particular environmental stimulants
and
even if we're able to
select against some of those
I I I
Very much doubt we will be
Able to eliminate all of them given the fact that they seem to be tightly linked to things like photosensitivity
nutrient uptake temperature sensitivity response and these are like pretty fundamental
um
biological mechanisms that the plant needs and so
you know
we could find that by
that there are linkages between
Well, we already know there are linkages between
Hermaphroditic or male um
trade expression in female plants
that are linked to photosensitivity and
so
We will probably find the same thing with nutrients uptake and with um temperature variables
because those have all been
demonstrated to have been correlated with
Hermaphroditism so yeah, it's a very complicated thing that is
going to be difficult to unpack but you can definitely do good breeding that moves away from
hermaphroditic trade expression and you can as tony was saying
And ryan has pointed out many times you can do that most quickly through
feminized breeding ironically
Yeah, um
I 100% agree with all that it just comes down to selection of the plant for the traits that you're after
And making sure you're not selecting that bad plant just because she looks pretty
And actually run her through some testing
In any way you have feasible
And then also what you brought up with the the abiotic stresses because that's what's happening. You got abiotic stress that's causing
Uh homophroditic issues and plants that have ethylene sensitivity on the female side
That's why we're seeing some of the homophrodites not every single one
But a lot of the morphodites we see in our gardens are from plants that are having issues with the environment
Which come through abiotic stress and not biotic issues. They're not endogenous to the plant system
They're from some outside source that we just are too lazy to figure out right and there's ways to understand this
There's a documentary called what plants talk about and in there
There's a section that goes over how a specific plant
once mechanically altered through
herbivores be it a pest or
Even say like cattle in the area grazing on the plant
Changes the chemical makeup of the plant to where it can alter not only itself but the plants around it by sending out a chemical
Signature so that the plants around it also produce this new chemical that isn't endogenous to the system
But has the ability to produce it because it's a defense mechanism
Which in a way?
Homophrodism is in cannabis
It's a defense mechanism to some form of stress in the garden that it's in be it the native
Garden that it started in or your tent in your basement
What's happening is that plant since the form of stress?
And has decided that it needs to reproduce the plant. That's what happens this plant
Needs to reproduce that's the only reason it's alive is to make another batch of seeds so it can continue on
So when one of the plants in that population, which is ethylene sensitive or for some other reason
Senses that stress it sends out pollen when it's a female it could be one stamina on the whole plant. It could be
Uh all over that plant you could be seeing stamina nodes on every single bud right and now you get a pollen formation that
Produces seed stock on the sisters around it
And in a wild ecotype you could have had a male also next to that same plant and the sisters that it pollinated
Could have a combination of seeds from either one and we have no way of knowing which ones are until we grow them out
and
Visualize the population that we see we start seeing homophrodites show
A lot we know that that trait's passing homogenous and we need to cull that from the population quit breeding with it
Do something if there's a new selection if it doesn't show itself then we know that this is a very
Recessive trait and we should breed with it with some other cultivars to find out if it's going to show up in another subpopulation
There's ways to go about doing it without doing uh sequencing sequencing would give us
A exact idea we'd be able to know if we have two alleles of the trait that we're looking for
And where it is on that dna strand so that
The females that or males we're going to breed it to we're going to know whether or not it's going to show up in that population
That's what's going to be coming with breeding
Instead of what we're doing now through visualization
Eventually everyone's going to be that serious is going to start
And which alleles the phenotypes and genotypes are after
Are expressing and actually carry so that we don't have to go through all these multiple
Multiple generations of breeding to try to pull out the traits that we're after
I think that that uh brings up a good point that you just can't stop life that life will always find a way
No matter what is thrown at it. Um, I think that uh, we have a question from the audience
What's that son? Let's see here. I'm gonna invite you up
Hey guys chase, thank you very much
um
Hey, hey trevor everybody. I really appreciate all the knowledge you're throwing this way. Um
so
anthony what you're talking about, uh
And chase how you followed up
I think from the plants point of view and yes the movie what plants talk about is
amazing, um
It wants to live and it's always protecting itself, right?
so
Uh, i'm wondering
Does it work the other way?
After a certain amount of adaptive stress
is
Is experienced by a plant and then you clone it and clone it and clone it again
Does it need more adaptive stress?
Than what the original mother and potentially those phenotypes that came off of it
Do they then need
Actually more
It hasn't become normalized
in your breeding practices where
Those phenotypes that you choose
And as you go down
continuously breeding
um
Whether or not you lose some of the genetics and drift
And whether or not that plant needs more
More adaptive stress now than the original i'm son and i'm complete
Son I know that what I have noticed is that whenever you're taking a cut off of a mother that you know inherently
That's not a separate phenotype. It should be the exact same phenotype of the plant that you took the cut from
um as far as genetic drift, um
You know, I know that that is kind of a
sensitive topic with some but at the same time I look at it from the very simple fact that
it's not necessarily sometimes genetic drip as much as
the problem that every time that that plant gets taken and
made into another clone
and given to
A b c and d growers and every time that they have a problem and then it gets passed along those problems
Inherently are being pushed along with that clone. So, you know whenever
You get a clone of something. It's not necessarily the exact same expression
That it was when it was in its glory
Um, I know that some of the cultivars that I have had to lug around that either disease
Viruses have affected those plants bugs
and all those things will make a difference when you're trying to
Um keep a plant around for for time
um, you know something as simple as having
Aphids really really bad or having fungus gnats really really bad where you start bringing in potential
viruses and disease or other
Other bugs that might affect that plant from a viral load standpoint that you know, all those things matter so
it's kind of like, uh
you know, we can almost use an std type, uh analogy here where you know when you uh,
Sleep with one that you slept with pretty much everyone before that
It's kind of the same way when a plant has been in one grow
It's literally been in every single grow that it's ever been in so all those problems
Um can be passed but at the same time
Um, if that plant is taken care of if you are able to give it the proper nutrition right by environment a lot of times
You can get that plant
From the the meristem and take a new clone of that and actually kind of get past some of those problems now that doesn't you know
That doesn't apply to every single disease that's out there
Um
But at the same time there is certain things that you can potentially come back from so
Cannabis is extremely resilient and most of the time i've always found that if I had a plant that was
Sick, or I was trying to bring back to health if I can put it into the ground where I have
um the
biology of the soil a lot of times that will almost
revise that plant
um
And bring it back to to health if i'm able to do that
Now I also know that that's also going to vary where you're at within
the world but in areas that you have
Um, you know a grow year. That's the entire year
Like if you're on the equator, um, you have the ability to be able to do things like that
So, I don't know if that helps to answer your question or not
Uh, well it does certainly uh part of it the second part of my question I think was um
When you're you were talking about secondary metabolites, uh in the combination thereof
Being important. You're also at the beginning talking about males being
Potentially having more genetics than the female
um
What I guess what I was asking
is
Once you've done your phenotype once you've chosen it and then you continue to clone
Whatever gave you that initial phenotype expression of the secondary metabolites and such meaning now you've got
Uh, all the compounds you're looking for. It's a full expression plant. It's got the kind of terpene profile you're doing
Um when you continue to clone say not go from seed but from clone
Do you see that
you know whether
whether or not in in
In as you're breeding this
For the next one in the next one. Do you have to?
Create more stress or the same amount of stress
Will still give you that same expression
Because now it's used to that stress I would think
Um, and do you now have to increase the stress for it to really
um
Come out the same or better
Does that make sense what i'm saying maybe I don't know the terminology
uh to ask the question
I kind of think what you're talking about would be acclimation of the uh,
Phenotypical expression of the genotype that you've selected
And how repeatable that is in that environment?
Which comes down to the epigenetic stability of that plant and the effects on that plant that actual clone
So if it stays in an environment for a specific time
That's dialed in and say you do that like i've held plants my males
I held them one male for 15 years. I had another male for eight years
And they were held in different locations and each one had a different expression
Uh the clone from that original parent based on where it was at
So to get that back to like if I took the male from one location and brought it to the other location to get that
original phenotypical expression back
That I had seen originally it would take longer for one to show it than the other
Because one had been in that
Quote unquote native environment much longer because it never got sent to the other room that had a different lighting schedule had different lighting
Spectrum so the epigenetic effect on that plant wasn't as bad as the one that was
Sent to the other area so that epigenetics is just um
reversible changes in the dna sequence or not in the
The they don't actually change the dna. It's just a different expression that pops up out of there
And you can actually get that back but based on
how
True breeding that line is for the traits that you're after would kind of dictate whether or not you had to do
Quote unquote use stressors like you're saying to get the effects you want. Maybe that plant
um homorphodites under specific uh set of stressors or maybe you get a terpene profile when you
Do a certain thing to the environment or an input that you give to the plant
Those can be repeated but you may not get that expression from the clone that you had in one area
As fast when you bring it back to a different location
So it all it all comes down to circumstance really for what you're after in my experience
Sure, so thank you for that anthony. So
Very very good. So biotic and abiotic
Conditions if you're indoors like you were talking about light and and such
How is it that you continue to have?
the same expression back
To be able to keep your genetics in a product let's say it's a medicine
And that you've worked on for significant amount of years
If the if the abiotic and biotic conditions are constantly changing as an example
Uh, because they're only certain ones that you can control and continue to keep going. I would think not all of it
How is it? What's that dynamic range? Do you are you able to i'm just curious how you do that?
Shitload of work
Kind of um, like I said, they show different expressions
So the expressions that show up all the time are kind of what?
Is that that locked in expression from your plants?
So through breeding is where I find out what i'm after. So instead of seeing it visually
I'm after it through its actual
proven breeding stock that like
I always use my angel male people get tired of me talking about it
But I use that plant across the 200 different females. So I knew what was going to come out of crosses
So when I knew when I saw a cross show something in a particular environment, I knew
If it was coming from my angel male
100
I knew what was going to show up in different environments because i'd seen it in so many different areas
Uh, so like I said the stress factors that you'd have to do to make that plant homoerphrodite
Some of the females that came out of the line
Were extreme so when if someone was growing the clones that I passed them
And all of a sudden there was homoerphrodite showing up and I would automatically know it was environmentally triggered
And I needed to start looking through the room and not looking at the plant. That's where her experience comes in
Then locking in that expression that you're talking about comes down to dialing in environment and knowing your your your plants
uh
Intimately right not just breeding with it for one season or two season
You should take a plant and use it for a long time. That's where heirlooms come in and how long they've been bred by
Uh humans for a specific amount of time to become what they are
You don't breed a line to become everything you wanted it in one year or two years or three years
It takes generations. It might take your grandson to finish the project you started today
If you truly want to be uh true about this plant and any plant, you know
Kevin talks about this a lot where what we start today
Is the basis and the foundation of the house that's going to be here for later
generations
and without that
without the um information that we all possess
And experience that we we would all just be stuck like asking that question. So what you're asking about
um
is really
It changes with cultivar because it the genes in these plants aren't locked in
What the expression you get today isn't the expression you're going to get in six months
It's just not
You're going to start seeing expressions from like anthocyanins are a great example
When the wounds are cold we start seeing purples and reds and yellows pop out of plants that look green in very hot environments
And this is a trait that if a dude's over in michigan and he never sees a hot day
Always thinks he's got a purple cultivar and then he moves over to where i'm at
It's 120 and you don't even see a shade of blue pop out on the tips of the bracts
So we we get two different expressions from a plant and now we both are breeding with it
And we have to go in different directions because of the expression we see
So unless we get enough experience with that particular
uh genotype that cultivar
We'll never know what we're really digging into we might always be looking for purples and trying to breed for it
It's never really in there because it's being induced by environment
do you feel the same about land races versus
The legacy ones you're talking about or are you saying the same thing?
uh with well that depends your definition land race, uh
Grace for me is a work line by man that's been
Acclimated to a specific area and environment which means it's going to show
uh less genotypical expressions
Um, the phenotypes are locked into that environment and what changes when we start to move it or if you're talking wild ecotypes
Which would mean we've got a very heterozygous population
Which already does not breed true for a lot of the traits that we think we're seeing
And while cannabis cannabis in itself is a heterozygous plant. It doesn't breed true for
Traits, that's why we have all the expressions we have today because it's in the gene pool
so
I believe the same thing on that it comes down to every
Every seed being a specific genotype of a gene pool that we've created
There was the original one that started it and from there man started to select out and it spread out and branching different diverse
ways
and even though they're all related they all became these different cannabis lines that we see today and we can take
A sister and a brother and give them to two different people
And they can line breed those in different directions through selfie you can take a male and a female
Like I said, we reverse that in one male both guys and through the progeny that comes from it
We can take that completely different directions
Okay
Sorry, tony, um
You finished what you were saying man, uh, but I would like to also uh jump in. That's okay. Go ahead. I was done. Go ahead
Oh, um son great question i've been like
searching, uh ever since uh chase brought up the
the misapplied
Reference to or you know
We've used the term genetic drift in the cannabis community to refer to
fluctuations or changes in
Clone varieties and there's actually a really good paper that talks about that very phenomenon
I was trying to find that but uh, I was able to I will find it and post it
but I like where this discussion has gone because
there's kind of
there's
Essentially traditional crop production or when I say traditional I mean, uh conventional so conventional agriculture
What we're typically breeding for things that are
maintained in
Resource intensive environments that are very intensively skewed outside of their normal. Um,
Environmental niche and so
that
That comes with trade-offs and it
Has a number of different
Drawbacks, um, it's inevitable that crop species are going to come under attack through different pests
We're seeing that happen with a whole different things of you know, and here i'm obviously referring to biotic
pests or pest pressures
but
all of those are
a very real issue that are going to constantly
be a
Essentially an arms race between the different pests and pathogens
on
That are impacting different crop species
Cannabis is no different than that from those
and you know that is
That is where
You know, we'll get chimera. We'll get
Matthew on here and we'll really do a deep dive on breeding for resistance, but I think that
that's sort of like an abnormal or
uh an exception because
Really what's going like when you bring up land races the
maintenance of
yield
in low intensity agriculture
and
the ability to adapt to biotic and abiotic stress is really what characterizes land race varieties and
the
The genetic framework of the genetic population structure that
Produces that is the obligate outcrossing
Population structure that we have with cannabis because we have a very
heterozygous and a very diverse
gene pool
you know, it's getting skewed under modern crop selection, but
in traditional land race production and in wild ecotypes like
Tony was mentioning the thing that makes it so those varieties are able to survive for instance like
the feral escapes in
the you know in the midwest here in the united states
they're
Able to do that because of the diversity
Within the gene pool that they have
And they sustain essentially an open random mating population
That maintains this diversity and that diversity gives them the ability to adapt to the different stresses that are going to exist
Because like you pointed out they do fluctuate from year to year and it's that
genetic variability where those recessive genes may be
undesirable when we put them into a heterozygous state and then grow them in a
Resource intensive crop environment
And we're like, oh, well this one doesn't yield or it has other drawbacks to it that make it so it's an undesirable plant
Out in nature that might be the particular gene combination that's necessary to survive under a particular set of environments
that may not be
common, they may not be
the
normative sort of like environmental niche that the plant has adapted itself to but
It may be an environmental variable that can happen and because it has that genetic variability
It's able to see itself through in you know in a particularly bad season
so
What we have is
in
In traditional crop breeding we essentially have a system of constant, you know
resistance susceptibility resistance susceptibility resistance susceptibility
Within the crop species and that's an arms race between breeders and between the different
Pest pressures or stresses and more and more it's going to be abiotic stresses. It's going to be temperature
It's going to be drought. It's going to be resource insufficiency
and
As we come up against those pressures
adapting our breeding strategies to ones that are able to
cope with
And overcome some of the limitations that we're going to face environmentally as we go through climate change and resource exhaustion
Those those are all very real things that are you know cannabis is coming online in a time in a place where global
uh climate and agricultural systems
fundamentally need to change and so
It's one of those things where you know
we probably won't see those changes but
To the extent that we can help to participate in that
Doing the breeding that maintains genetic diversity
is absolutely essential because that genetic diversity is what's going to be able to produce the
The adaptability to new environments that and variables that we don't necessarily have to deal with or address right now
Would you put that in the same space?
um
Understanding homozygous where we are right now. It would seem to me. There's market pressure. Uh,
I mean most not most but all
um
Okay, i'll do it again. Most of them are
bred from afghan kush to try to get the
Sort of turn time
um
Short turn time to be able to get four cycles or five cycles or whatever
um
if but what you're talking about
I think
I would agree with
Not that I have a disagreement on either way, you know
there are market pressures and what the market wants versus what you might consider quality cannabis of full genetic expression
The second so there's a question in there somewhere, uh, but the second part of this is
I too use the word genetic drift
Quite I think wrong
That's not the statement. The thing is that it doesn't express
And I think it has to do with frequency. I think it's
in the plant all the time
and because of biotic and abiotic
Conditions and I guess I call more even frequency. Um
energy
It doesn't completely express all those so they they sit dormant until they get that and obviously enough to be able to live
Understanding that that the cannabis has a significant amount of of genetics
Would you agree with those two points or did I not maybe i'm not clear on what i'm saying?
First one i'm saying is
that the homozygous
type of
Genetics that we have right now
are bred for very high thc
Very short-lived
highs
uh pop corny, uh
Just sort of like this is what the dispensaries want i'm going to deliver it
Versus because i've had the same conversation with kevin jodrey as well
uh
and then
and then the second part of that is
Based on why you think it's very important to have homozygous to have variation and diversity
I would think those are two different conversations. And then the second part is the genetic drift
i'm
I'm i'm asking I guess i'm not saying that I know you guys are significantly much more intelligent in this space
so what i'm asking is that
for the most part it's like, um
You're not getting the expression out of it because maybe
There's certain biotic and abiotic
conditions
Not available to the plant at the moment, whether it's the living soil whether it's whatever vpd
All this sort of symbiotic things necessary for the plant to grow is as it did in outdoors
um
Is not available so it doesn't express all of those compounds and secondary metabolites
And and and would that be true or not true?
on both points 100 percent, um
Market pressures have for a long time shaped the cannabis genome. Um
Their intensity of has only ratcheted up it's become much much more intense and you know, it's
It's been a subtext to a bit of the discussion throughout the night, you know
the 30 percent thc
sort of barometer and
That's something that is definitely shaped by market pressures
and
a lot of the genome has been shaped and pushed into
first the like dealing with
I call them market pressures just now but like
The previous pressures were obviously prohibition pressures
And the fact that lots of people got pushed indoors lots of people were forced to operate using smaller populations
All of that created literal genetic drift and skewed the allele frequency
To make it so that varieties could be adapted and grown indoors
the introduction of the afghan
Varietals that really shortened the flowering time
Increased yields and for initially as chimera had mentioned earlier helped to produce some really interesting hybrid vigor
Which has largely been lost over the years through this constant poly hybridization
within this select population
that has
agronomically valuable traits in the black market traditional production sort of economy
that has been bootstrapped into this new sort of like
insane
recreational market that's a patchwork across different states
And so on that level, yes, the genome
Has and will continue to be shaped by market pressures
That's true of every crop as well. If you look at corn if you look at all the other crop species same dynamics happen
and far too often
Uh in other crop species the realization about the value of genetic diversity happened
Way too late. Um, and that's some that's true
In the cannabis world if you look look back at different discussions
there were lots of people talking about genetic erosion in cannabis for years and the deleterious impacts of just
polyhybridization and mixing different gene pools and
introducing
modern hybrids into traditional places of origin
and then on the second point that you're talking about with regard to
Really genetic expression in relation to environmental variables
That's absolutely again the case
Everybody needs to understand that phenotypes are
the result of a whole host of interactions it's oftentimes very simply represented as
genes times environment equals phenotype, but there's actually a number of interactions on top of that
There's
gene environment interactions there are
genetic variables there are
gene to gene variables
and there are
gene to gene to environment and variables that are all
All result in the end phenotype so
if you have
particular environmental variables that induce a particular genetic response
That can have cascading effects that alter phenotype alter secondary metabolites
So it's absolutely true that
The either
lack of
stresses or present of stresses can have
A whole host of different impacts on the actual phenotypic expression
And I think you know, Matthew somebody Matthew Gates
Cinch angel he's somebody who or sink angel. Um, he's somebody who can speak to
Some of the
Oftentimes we characterize
pests
Both biotic and abiotic
Pressures
In a negative context solely or in like a good bad sort of dichotomy
and he does a very good job of demonstrating giving concrete examples of how
some of the
the
Pressures that are experienced by plants
Are actually some of the things that induce the secondary metabolism and that it's much more complex and
not not as simply reductive or you know binary sort of dynamic between
Good and bad in terms of pest pressures pathogen pressures and you know
We'll get into this more. We're gonna we're working on a series that really gets into the molecular biology
But like when you get down to the cellular level
and
You know chloroplast and mitochondria and things like that
It becomes a much more complicated picture and much more mutualism
in the environment that hopefully we can start to take advantage of particularly with living soils and kind of
moving to a new
regenerative
agricultural model
Yes, yes, absolutely
Chase, um, I don't want to take up the stage with all my questions, but I have one last one for the group
I'm located in southern california in laguna beach
Do you guys have anybody in this?
in this space in the genetic sort of world that
Is working in living soil
Wants to do more, uh unique genetic work
in
full expression plants
Particularly medicinal more medicinal. I consider it all medicinal by the way in my mind
But is there anybody down in socal that we could?
do some
actionable, you know
actionable collaboration with with regards to
Genetics and some
Even reading some of the dark heart
Nursery article just came out. Uh, and just laughable to me, but um
I'm wondering if you guys anybody there could back channel me
I tried to back channel a couple of you guys earlier
but I didn't get a response because I don't know if anybody's using that in the back rather than instagram, but
If anybody does in socal
that we could collaborate with for for
For good reason to to help the plant to help the medicine of it
To
to
you know to be able to get more diversification also to
Maintain some of the land races for their rusticity
potentially to to cross with
to be able to get some other
um secondary metabolites and compounds, I I would welcome
Any help in that arena or or a collaboration between two or three groups. It doesn't really matter
I'm sun and i'm complete
I'm
Sun, I know that uh, I can at least speak for myself that everybody on the stage except for
Me and maybe dan i'm not for sure. I don't know dan very well, but um, i'm not close to you by any measure
Um, so I think that everyone else would probably be a better resource for that. Um,
also in regards to
um your
land race
Cultivars, you know keep in mind that outside the united states that selection is done for completely different reasons than what we select
for the united states
In the united states, we have resources that are available when you're in
Afghanistan when you're in pakistan when you're in india, you know, you have limited access to water
So they are selecting cultivars that are going to be drought resistant stuff that is going to
Finish within the time frame that they need it to before their cold weather sets in
stuff that is inherently
going to survive
more so than it's going to look pretty just because a lot of
power outside of
What I call the cradle of life
Is grown for flower production versus some of these areas that are grown primarily for hash production
Um just because they don't have the ability to store
genetics the way that uh, some of us do where we can vacuum seal something if we wanted to
You know not let it get oxidated
And or we can put it in a jar where you know, some of these guys they literally don't have some of these resources
so complete difference between the selection process as a whole so
Um, anyways, that's what I had to say
So son we we can uh talk offline later i'm i'm also obviously in socal and uh,
I have lots of ideas on that front. Um
I was joking, uh speaking of back channel with chase of all the things I got done in the five hours since we've been
Coming live
I uh cooked dinner. I ate dinner. Uh
Uh my three-year-old and I set up toilets facing each other and we synchronized our peas and
uh
Packed up lots of seed packs. Uh, yeah, it's been it's been a productive five hours
Thank you, I will do that pietro really appreciate it. Um, one other question I had then um
And again not to show my naive
My ignorance maybe is the word but at what point in time
Uh, would you consider going seed to seed to seed to seed
Like don't you miss the tap root? Um
Don't you miss other things?
in your genetic work, um
And what would be the ideal situation?
Uh, if you could go back to seed to seed
And that was one question the second one is
do you consider
a cannabis plant a perennial or a
An annual i'm sun and i'm complete
I know that you know for for me
Um, it's really kind of in the wording, you know, because the plant's life cycle is beginning to end, you know within a year
Now obviously those seeds will be dropped and they will sprout for the the next season
um, but at the same time, um
You know for for me anything that is going to go through its entire growth process within one season
Um is put into a certain category for myself
And as far as the the seed to seed to seed thing, um
I I think that there's pros and cons with both of those. So, you know once you find that cultivar
um or that plant that will
Meet your needs, you know, sometimes it's important to be able to work off of clones. Um,
because of the fact that you are going to get a
pretty baseline set of results from it if it's grown under, you know, the same conditions or optimal conditions or a
um
a median set of conditions and
when you are growing
Uh a new cultivar or if you are growing say that you buy
A hundred seeds of something and then you know every season you grow out ten of those things
You know, every single one of those plants is going to express a little bit differently
um, so just because one of those plants might hit all the boxes for you doesn't mean that
That 11th seed that 12th seed will be the same. So that's the reason why it's so important
Um to be able to keep cultivars for
long-term
preservation purposes and unfortunately
You know, that is one issue that I do have with seeds is that the fact is you are going to have a different
Expression every single time which you know, it's all about being able to
replicate something
Consistently, um, you know, that's kind of what for me separates cannabis as a medicine from taking
Tylenol because Tylenol you get, you know, 200 milligrams and it's 200 milligrams every single time
where if you are making
um edibles and
Say that you have a cultivar that is going to be 20 percent THC and then next time you have some type of predication
issues or you have some type of
Stressor that makes you harvest a week early and say that you don't have the same development of cannabinoids
At that same time. So now the second time you've grown it now you have a different set of cannabinoid numbers or numerics
So therefore you have to change that formula to be able to equal
You know your hundred milligram edible and I see all the time when you actually look at the
Depending on what states are in
Some states, you know, they have literally, you know
The cannabinoid profile everything down to what was used to grow the plant on the packaging other states just have you know
basic THC CBD
terpenes
You know it passed testing. So but I see all the time where
Here, I'll look at this bag of edibles
It's supposed to be 200 milligrams, but whenever I flip it over
each
Gummy, there's 10 gummies. It's supposed to be 20 milligrams each
But when I turn this thing over and look at it says here that each gummy is
18.31 milligrams, so this thing is
183 point one three milligrams
Even though it says that it's 200 milligrams on the package and if I pull out another one
That is just another flavor of gummy
That I'm looking at this and this one is another 200 total milligrams
but I'm looking at twenty two point three two milligrams per gummy and
That's the difference between
something being
Or having a high efficacy rate is because sometimes you need a specific dosage amount
Obviously with the cannabinoid system or the endocannabinoid system, you know
The way that we all process cannabinoids is going to fluctuate a little bit differently
Whereas a lot of medications they will ultimately, you know, they're meant to
Affect everyone the exact same way
every single time
So for me, that's kind of what separates
Cannabis versus some of those other things which I know I completely believe in cannabis as a medicine
but at the same time I do see the challenges when it comes to
Being able to duplicate some of these things where you're able to make a hundred milligram cookie
Every single time or you're able to grow a plant out that has a genetic cap of say
25% THC a where you're gonna hit that every single time it just it doesn't happen because
You know for most of us don't have a grow that is dialed in that perfectly and at the same time
You know a lot of people
Are growing multiple cultivars in the same room and using the same feed
Which different plants like different feeds at different amounts some like more light some like less light so, you know all those things matter
When it comes down to it
Yes, but when you let's say you've developed your you've done your work. You've got your seeds
You're gonna send them all out, right?
If
Everybody has different abiotic and biotic conditions or different grow methods
you can have that same chemo bar and have all different kinds of expressions come back and
Even I would think and maybe I'm completely wrong
But different levels of compounds and you add to that the different labs that do the different testing
How is it that you're gonna get consistent?
I would say medicine of your particular seed
Grown at different places or different methods or different ways. I
Think that the the
Layman's term or answer for that is the fact that that's probably not really obtainable. That's more. You know, it's kind of like the idea of
Perfection that's more of an idea
Than a place or something that exists and I always use that with
Paradise paradise is more of an idea than a place you actually live because all of us can probably say hey
You know, we'd like to live on the beach and be able to tan all day long
But then what happens when you want to go downhill skiing so, you know all those things like that
Are going to be factors, but I just don't think that
We're ever going to be able to achieve that level of perfection
With the plant but the hunt is still what's important and you know for me. It's all about the chase not necessarily the catch
Pun intended with my name
Uh-huh. Well, thank you. Yeah
So Trevor
Five hours deep you guys want to wrap it up before my wife chokes me out
Peter you already got my
All right, we we ready to wrap
The quorum Luell cinder are you down with that?

All right. Good night, everybody
Respect everybody. Thank you
All right
The room is closed it's not expecting that to go
Five hours and ten minutes in but uh
It's a good conversation
and
Tomorrow I have no idea what's going on
Someone DM to me an Instagram and I don't know if you're watching but they were like you do too much shows. I
Can't keep up
Slow it down
But we're going strong we're charging ahead with the content
Sasha tall jarred
