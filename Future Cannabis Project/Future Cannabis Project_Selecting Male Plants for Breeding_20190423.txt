[00:00.000 --> 00:05.320]  What traits do you look for specifically in male plants if you're seeking a good breeder?
[00:05.320 --> 00:19.520]  Well, I'm a big fan of the stem rub and I really love turpins and all the different
[00:19.520 --> 00:23.600]  possibilities that there are in the cannabis species.
[00:23.600 --> 00:36.400]  So that's something that has served me well forever and I'll probably never put down that
[00:36.400 --> 00:40.600]  tool no matter what.
[00:40.600 --> 00:46.720]  And then we did some testing of males this year.
[00:46.720 --> 00:49.560]  That's kind of a cool trick.
[00:49.560 --> 00:54.280]  But yeah, and then certainly structure.
[00:54.280 --> 00:59.560]  And if you're trying to breed for homozygosity or uniformity, then you want to look for one
[00:59.560 --> 01:05.640]  that has a similar structure to if you're trying to make an inbred line, for example,
[01:05.640 --> 01:06.640]  or something like that.
[01:06.640 --> 01:12.080]  So Gene, you want to do some of that?
[01:12.080 --> 01:18.520]  That's actually just touching the plant and seeing really what smells you get from the
[01:18.520 --> 01:20.920]  stem.
[01:20.920 --> 01:23.160]  Different ones are different.
[01:23.160 --> 01:29.480]  So like OG, and everybody's nose works different, but like me, I can pick an OG male hella easy
[01:29.480 --> 01:32.260]  because it smells like dill pickles to me.
[01:32.260 --> 01:37.440]  And if it smells like dill pickles, that one has it and it doesn't mean that it'll necessarily
[01:37.440 --> 01:40.900]  carry it depending on what you're pulling it from.
[01:40.900 --> 01:47.300]  So if you already have seeds where you know that all the females do smell like OG and
[01:47.300 --> 01:52.460]  then you get a male out of there that, you know, like if I was going to be breeding something
[01:52.460 --> 01:57.280]  with OG, for example, I'd be like, okay, what does it need improvement on?
[01:57.280 --> 01:59.680]  So you want a little bit of an improved structure.
[01:59.680 --> 02:01.420]  So it's a little more sturdy.
[02:01.420 --> 02:05.160]  You want improved resistance to powdery mildew.
[02:05.160 --> 02:09.860]  So if I was breeding OGs, I'd probably want to like stick them in a room and get them
[02:09.860 --> 02:11.620]  really humid for a little while.
[02:11.620 --> 02:15.620]  Maybe let them droop a couple times before they're really flowering heavy so that I can
[02:15.620 --> 02:20.840]  kind of trigger their stress response so that they'll get attacked on purpose.
[02:20.840 --> 02:25.140]  So you can kind of go, okay, there's the one that's resistant because otherwise if you
[02:25.140 --> 02:31.880]  treat them, you know, if they have perfect conditions and you're breeding for something
[02:31.880 --> 02:35.680]  that's triggered by bad conditions, you're not going to see it.
[02:35.680 --> 02:39.280]  So there's no way to select for that.
[02:39.280 --> 02:43.300]  So you have to kind of put pressures on things to see different things.
[02:43.360 --> 02:46.440]  If you want to know if the branches are strong, you're going to have to snap them.
[02:46.440 --> 02:49.520]  You have to be like, all right, weak, weak branches.
[02:49.520 --> 02:51.160]  You break some, you know?
[02:51.160 --> 02:57.820]  And then some plants grow with like actually almost, sometimes it'll almost look like a
[02:57.820 --> 03:04.080]  bubble at the junction of the branch and the main stock.
[03:04.080 --> 03:10.120]  So it'll actually be like, there's these ones where they'll never break right at the junction.
[03:10.120 --> 03:15.100]  They'll actually bend and kind of break over right up from it a little bit.
[03:15.100 --> 03:17.600]  And those ones tend to be a lot more sturdy.
[03:17.600 --> 03:20.140]  And I found those in most stuff.
[03:20.140 --> 03:24.940]  So it's like, you know, little things like that are cool to look for.
[03:24.940 --> 03:34.040]  But you know, yeah, the stem rub is basically, if you, I really like to, if I can grow something,
[03:34.040 --> 03:35.840]  if I have enough seeds.
[03:35.840 --> 03:39.580]  If I don't have enough, I'll grow them and I'll just use all the males and all the females
[03:39.640 --> 03:40.940]  and do an open pollination.
[03:40.940 --> 03:44.900]  So I know I have a bunch more and then out of my favorite females, then I'll try some
[03:44.900 --> 03:45.900]  of those.
[03:45.900 --> 03:51.380]  And when I do the, when I grow them out the first time, I'll try to figure out which plants,
[03:51.380 --> 03:52.460]  you have to observe a lot.
[03:52.460 --> 03:57.940]  So you look, okay, these plants, I can notice these things about them.
[03:57.940 --> 04:05.540]  And then when they finish as female plants, then you kind of see trends.
[04:05.540 --> 04:12.500]  So you go, okay, well, every female that looked like this or that had the stem rub,
[04:12.500 --> 04:14.740]  they wound up being like this.
[04:14.740 --> 04:16.940]  And then you can get a correlation there.
[04:16.940 --> 04:22.100]  And then you know, okay, so like, if you're looking for a good OG male and you go, this
[04:22.100 --> 04:23.980]  one smells like OG.
[04:23.980 --> 04:27.940]  It's like, it turns out, no, the really good OG clones to me that I have, they smell like
[04:27.940 --> 04:29.060]  pickles.
[04:29.060 --> 04:30.700]  So I want the male that smells like pickles.
[04:30.700 --> 04:33.260]  If it smells like OG, when it's done, it might not smell like OG.
[04:33.820 --> 04:35.300]  It already smells like OG on the stem.
[04:35.300 --> 04:38.700]  So it's kind of like learning the plants.
[04:38.700 --> 04:42.980]  And so I like to learn them before I try to really do any selective breeding.
[04:42.980 --> 04:44.580]  And that makes it easier.
[04:44.580 --> 04:47.760]  And that's the thing about looking for male traits is there's overall ones.
[04:47.760 --> 04:50.260]  You don't want one that's a pest magnet.
[04:50.260 --> 04:52.760]  You don't want one that's a fungus magnet.
[04:52.760 --> 04:57.980]  You don't want one that has really weak, snappy structure or, you know, if maybe if they're
[04:57.980 --> 05:01.500]  super hard to clone or they have really weak roots.
[05:01.500 --> 05:06.300]  There's some basic things that you can look for just overall and go, that's not the best
[05:06.300 --> 05:08.680]  plant for these reasons.
[05:08.680 --> 05:12.260]  But a lot of times with selecting males, you actually want to find the one that carries
[05:12.260 --> 05:14.460]  what you like about the females.
[05:14.460 --> 05:18.580]  So that takes observation and figuring out where it is.
[05:18.580 --> 05:26.820]  And different genes basically travel in groups in breeding to where you might try to get
[05:26.820 --> 05:30.700]  rid of something and discover that every time you get rid of that, you get rid of the other
[05:30.900 --> 05:31.980]  thing you wanted.
[05:31.980 --> 05:37.460]  So maybe you go, oh, I always want, maybe somebody's already made, already bred something
[05:37.460 --> 05:43.140]  that you're starting with where you go, the one that I like to smoke, I can grow as many
[05:43.140 --> 05:44.140]  as I want.
[05:44.140 --> 05:48.020]  And the ones I really like, they always have kind of flimsy branches.
[05:48.020 --> 05:53.020]  So you might be stuck with that unless you want to make a new hybrid and then incorporate
[05:53.020 --> 05:54.100]  strength.
[05:54.100 --> 05:58.100]  And in your new hybrid, you can get new stuff happening, you know.
[05:58.620 --> 06:04.420]  It's really for male selecting to me is really looking at finding which male is the one that
[06:04.420 --> 06:09.620]  really does what I want in that type and then using those kinds of males.
[06:09.620 --> 06:16.980]  So it really takes like studying the way that is, and then you can pick them.
[06:16.980 --> 06:22.020]  And then of course, use your general things where you go, okay, anything crappy, we don't
[06:22.020 --> 06:23.260]  want to use that.
[06:23.260 --> 06:27.960]  But of the ones that we like, then you want to figure out what's like the actual, it's
[06:28.820 --> 06:31.840]  almost like seeing a face and recognizing a face or recognizing a voice.
[06:31.840 --> 06:33.120]  You're like, there's that plant.
[06:33.120 --> 06:35.000]  I know that plant, it always does this.
[06:35.000 --> 06:40.100]  So you want to find those correlations and those groups of traits that all travel together.
[06:40.100 --> 06:44.760]  Like someone was asking me about the pinas that I sold this year, they're purple stem
[06:44.760 --> 06:49.000]  and they're all purple stem and they all have the same smell.
[06:49.000 --> 06:55.520]  And the trip was that the purple stem travels with this particular group of terpenes so
[06:55.520 --> 06:59.520]  that it's really easy to breed it to have the smell if you just look for the ones with
[06:59.520 --> 07:02.120]  the purple stems and then you smell the stock.
[07:02.120 --> 07:04.560]  There might be a couple of them that are a little off.
[07:04.560 --> 07:08.080]  You go, no, but this one has the most of that smell and it's purple stem.
[07:08.080 --> 07:12.920]  You put them together and really fast I was able to go, okay, this is that.
[07:12.920 --> 07:20.680]  So if that was, that male might've been the sturdiest and the stinkiest and the fastest
[07:20.680 --> 07:24.360]  growing, but if you hate that smell, don't pick the purple stem one.
[07:24.360 --> 07:25.360]  You got to get a different one.
[07:25.360 --> 07:27.600]  So you got to learn the plants.
[07:27.600 --> 07:35.520]  And then when you select your males, then you can have success a lot easier.
[07:35.520 --> 07:42.480]  You can also just go, I really like this plant and use that male because you're likely to
[07:42.480 --> 07:44.240]  get plants that look like it.
[07:44.240 --> 07:45.400]  And that might've been what you like.
[07:45.400 --> 07:49.160]  You're like, wow, this thing has a luster and a vigor to it.
[07:49.160 --> 07:51.240]  And it's like, well, you're at least going to get that.
[07:51.240 --> 07:55.120]  And then you can find out later if you get those other traits that are important to you
[07:55.120 --> 07:56.120]  too.
[07:56.120 --> 07:57.120]  You can always try it.
[07:57.120 --> 08:01.920]  You can always throw it and see if it sticks, but you want to ideally learn what you're
[08:01.920 --> 08:03.800]  working with first.
[08:03.800 --> 08:08.440]  And then like I was talking about the weirdos in the cherry limeade.
[08:08.440 --> 08:13.400]  Like if you didn't mind having really little weird plants, you might be able to make really
[08:13.400 --> 08:16.000]  cool stuff with that because the weeds always kill her.
[08:16.000 --> 08:17.400]  The plant's not that good though.
[08:17.400 --> 08:22.120]  So what I did is I looked and looked till I got males that had the same smell and the
[08:22.120 --> 08:25.360]  same resinous leaves and everything.
[08:25.360 --> 08:28.040]  And then I went, okay, so this is like that.
[08:28.040 --> 08:32.440]  It's more rare in this form, but this has the traits I like in that, but this thing
[08:32.440 --> 08:37.640]  grows and it doesn't have a weird look to it that freaks people out.
[08:37.640 --> 08:39.960]  So then you wind up going with that.
[08:39.960 --> 08:43.360]  But that's how I select males personally is by learning what it is.
[08:43.360 --> 08:47.880]  You're like, okay, what if you were breeding dogs, you'd be like, okay, you're not going
[08:47.880 --> 08:50.440]  to breed Rottweilers and go, I liked this one.
[08:50.440 --> 08:53.720]  It didn't have Rottweiler markings, but it's a good Rottweiler.
[08:53.720 --> 08:55.920]  And then after a while people would be like, this ain't a Rottweiler dude.
[08:55.920 --> 08:57.680]  You didn't pick the right one.
[08:57.680 --> 08:58.680]  That was a sport.
[08:58.680 --> 09:01.640]  It was different and it wasn't the right thing to use.
[09:01.640 --> 09:04.360]  So you want to learn, you want to know what a Rottweiler looks like.
[09:04.360 --> 09:08.560]  You want to know how tall is the shoulder, how tall is the hips, what's the sway in the
[09:08.560 --> 09:09.560]  back?
[09:09.560 --> 09:11.520]  How long is the tail on a puppy?
[09:11.520 --> 09:13.200]  How do the ears lay?
[09:14.040 --> 09:15.040]  Where do their teeth sit?
[09:15.040 --> 09:18.200]  Howard, what's the line in the front?
[09:18.200 --> 09:21.320]  All that stuff to learn to go, okay, now I'm breeding dogs.
[09:21.320 --> 09:24.520]  So if you really want to breed stuff, you really have to know the description of what
[09:24.520 --> 09:25.880]  you're shooting for.
[09:25.880 --> 09:28.120]  And that's how you pick the males.
[09:28.120 --> 09:33.200]  But that's not to say you might have had a killer dog that was like a Rottweiler that
[09:33.200 --> 09:35.480]  was all black or all tan.
[09:35.480 --> 09:37.280]  And you're like, I like that one.
[09:37.280 --> 09:38.280]  Nothing wrong with that.
[09:38.280 --> 09:41.800]  You're just going to be going to a new place and you have to have focus for doing that.
[09:41.800 --> 09:47.680]  So you can just randomly select a male because you like it, but it's going to be more difficult
[09:47.680 --> 09:50.320]  to lock down the exact things you want.
[09:50.320 --> 09:53.760]  So you want to learn your genetics to pick them, you know?
