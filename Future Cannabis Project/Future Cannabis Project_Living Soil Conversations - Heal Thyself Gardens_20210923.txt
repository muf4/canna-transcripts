[00:00.570 --> 00:09.510]  All right, and we are right on time. That's to you, Mr. Robert Greenfingers Thomas. We're
[00:09.510 --> 00:11.350]  right on time, so take it away, Brian.
[00:11.350 --> 00:16.270]  Yeah, good morning, Living Soil Nerds. Happy Thursday to you. Again, we're just going out
[00:16.270 --> 00:21.670]  of our way to bring you the best and brightest, and we have another real treat for you. This
[00:21.670 --> 00:28.310]  is a special day for me, just some quick upfront stuff. I asked my wife to marry me a year
[00:28.310 --> 00:34.190]  ago today on this very day, so that's something that's really important for us. We're just
[00:34.190 --> 00:38.550]  excited to moving into this new chapter in our life, so just want to put it out there.
[00:38.550 --> 00:42.730]  I appreciate everything you do for me, Natasha. She's a big reason why we're able to do this
[00:42.730 --> 00:46.510]  show every Thursday, so just wanted to start off with that.
[00:46.510 --> 00:50.750]  And Brian, I can match you on that front. Today's my anniversary.
[00:50.750 --> 00:51.750]  Fantastic. See?
[00:51.750 --> 00:52.750]  Congratulations.
[00:52.750 --> 00:57.270]  And I guarantee you, without these ladies in our life, there's no way we'd be able to
[00:57.270 --> 01:02.110]  do this for you guys, so just wanted to give a shout out. Layton as well. I know his lady
[01:02.110 --> 01:05.950]  is always—sometimes you can hear her doing the dishes in the background. Life's going
[01:05.950 --> 01:12.750]  on behind the scenes, so we just appreciate our ladies in our lives, and I know Joey definitely
[01:12.750 --> 01:17.830]  appreciates you as well. For you guys that don't know, we also interviewed Joey Berger.
[01:17.830 --> 01:22.550]  In my opinion, I think Layton would co-sign this. That gentleman is a living legend with
[01:22.550 --> 01:28.270]  a lot of the stuff that you guys are finding out about, so go check his video out on—what
[01:28.270 --> 01:33.430]  was that? Two, three weeks ago, I think, we interviewed Joey. So we're excited to talk
[01:33.430 --> 01:34.430]  to you.
[01:34.430 --> 01:38.230]  Can we get a shirtless Joey camera bomb, photo bomb?
[01:38.230 --> 01:40.230]  There he is.
[01:40.230 --> 01:42.230]  He's not shirtless, but—
[01:42.230 --> 01:47.230]  Ah, boo. He was shirtless two minutes ago.
[01:47.230 --> 01:48.230]  What's up, bro?
[01:48.910 --> 01:57.110]  I feel like—all right, so there's just a lot that you guys bring to the industry and
[01:57.110 --> 02:00.950]  just bring to the community as a whole, and I just wanted to also say that we are very
[02:00.950 --> 02:05.190]  grateful for that. A lot of the things that we have learned or we've been learning from
[02:05.190 --> 02:11.910]  you guys, especially Joey, over the last few years, I feel like just pumping out a lot
[02:11.910 --> 02:16.150]  of education on YouTube and Instagram and all those different things. So I'm excited
[02:16.150 --> 02:20.430]  to now give the platform to you and talk to you because I understand that you're an
[02:20.430 --> 02:25.430]  OG in your own right. You've been an herbologist or herbalist—I never know which way to say
[02:25.430 --> 02:30.350]  that—for 20-plus years. So I kind of wanted to start there and let people understand kind
[02:30.350 --> 02:34.310]  of more of your background, the reason why I would definitely consider that an OG as
[02:34.310 --> 02:41.150]  well, and the way that you cultivate and that kind of stuff. It's very matter-of-fact,
[02:41.150 --> 02:45.510]  almost blueprint. When I was doing research on you for our interview this week, I feel
[02:45.870 --> 02:50.030]  you just really understand these concepts. So I'm excited for our viewers to be able
[02:50.030 --> 02:55.190]  to understand this, and it seems like you're very articulate and able to put it in layman's
[02:55.190 --> 03:00.030]  terms. So it's very basic stuff. So I would imagine if you're newer to a lot of these
[03:00.030 --> 03:04.750]  techniques, get your pen and paper because this is going to be one hell of a show.
[03:04.750 --> 03:10.350]  Layton also, I'm sure you know, she's a DemPure certified farmer. So I feel like for a lot
[03:10.350 --> 03:14.590]  of the old heads and that kind of stuff, that's really all you got to say to a lot of people
[03:14.590 --> 03:16.190]  anymore. So shout out to them as well.
[03:16.190 --> 03:20.390]  Yeah, big shout out to Dem and the work that they've been doing over the years and getting
[03:20.390 --> 03:25.670]  people to come together as a family and not charging any money to be certified and having
[03:25.670 --> 03:31.230]  the olders help the youngers as they transition through the process of becoming Dem. So shout
[03:31.230 --> 03:36.390]  out to Dragonfly Earth Medicine and Josh and Kelly and their whole group. So yeah, dive
[03:36.390 --> 03:38.390]  right in tomorrow.
[03:38.390 --> 03:43.350]  Okay. Go ahead.
[03:43.350 --> 03:47.550]  We'd love to learn more about the herbalist side of you, the 20 plus years of what you've
[03:47.550 --> 03:53.310]  learned because I feel like at that level, you just really understand plants. You know,
[03:53.310 --> 03:58.030]  just I feel like a lot of us understand cannabis or building soil for cannabis. But if you
[03:58.030 --> 04:01.590]  took me and started to ask me, you know, a lot of things I want to learn today, even
[04:01.590 --> 04:04.950]  about like stinging nettles and the benefit of all that kind of stuff, I would have to
[04:04.950 --> 04:08.870]  go back and research a lot of that stuff to be able to give the right answers on a bunch
[04:08.870 --> 04:12.830]  of different questions. So I'm excited to just kind of pick your brain and see where
[04:12.830 --> 04:13.830]  this goes.
[04:13.830 --> 04:24.950]  Awesome. Okay. My path kind of started out very, very unusual, honestly. I knew I was
[04:24.950 --> 04:29.030]  going to work like an environmental science. That was like my whole growing up. I was like,
[04:29.030 --> 04:33.790]  I'm going to be an environmental scientist. And I would like learn plants when I was younger.
[04:33.790 --> 04:39.070]  I studied a lot of the rainforest plants because I was determined I was going to work in Brazil.
[04:39.070 --> 04:42.350]  And I was even trying to learn like Portuguese at a young age because that's where I was
[04:42.870 --> 04:51.990]  going. But life has so many twists and turns. And I ended up like in college studying theater
[04:51.990 --> 04:56.190]  and environmental science at the same time. It just really went full on the theater for
[04:56.190 --> 05:02.150]  a long time. And so that was just part of my path. And I got into acting and everything.
[05:02.150 --> 05:09.430]  But through that, I was out in LA for like in Hollywood for a while. And that path led
[05:09.430 --> 05:16.950]  me down to like an addiction. And I had to like pull myself out of like this drug addiction
[05:16.950 --> 05:22.510]  and this fake world. And like how I did that was like natural health. And like I really
[05:22.510 --> 05:27.870]  dive deep into my own health and trying to understand myself and who I was. It was really
[05:27.870 --> 05:35.350]  just an evolution of figuring out who I am. And that's really what led me to start working
[05:35.470 --> 05:42.310]  with medicinal plants and understanding diet and how diet was everything. You know, if
[05:42.310 --> 05:46.750]  you really want to have health and you need to have a clean diet. And that really led
[05:46.750 --> 05:53.750]  me down a really obsessed, passionate path for a really long time. And from that, I started
[05:54.630 --> 06:01.630]  studying massage therapy, which led me to Reiki, which led me to body talk and yoga.
[06:02.630 --> 06:09.630]  And I studied a lot of different healing modalities for years. And I always knew I was going to
[06:09.630 --> 06:16.630]  end up studying like full on into herbs. And I did. I ended up taking off for a little
[06:16.630 --> 06:21.790]  bit. I was in Babylon, as I call it, for a while. And I had like a really great massage
[06:21.790 --> 06:27.110]  practice. And I was starting to incorporate a bunch of different herbs. And I had already
[06:27.110 --> 06:32.870]  become an aromatherapist, which is like the study of essential oils. And so that was already
[06:32.870 --> 06:38.990]  part of my path. But I was in Babylon and I just realized like this wasn't my thing.
[06:38.990 --> 06:45.990]  And I remember seeing a RV alongside the road and was like, what if? And one day I did it.
[06:47.630 --> 06:54.630]  I like bought a bus and I traveled around with my two year old son. And we I did wolfing.
[06:55.630 --> 07:01.630]  That's really where my farming journey began and was through the world. You know, it is
[07:01.630 --> 07:07.070]  that the World Organization of Organic Farmers and you're able to do work trade. And so I
[07:07.070 --> 07:13.790]  worked on a lot of different farms and many different climates like desert climate to
[07:13.790 --> 07:20.470]  like really wet and kind of rainy and Midwest and even up to California. So I got to see
[07:20.470 --> 07:27.110]  a lot of different environments. And but on my journey of traveling, I I got a lot
[07:27.110 --> 07:34.110]  of different skills. And one of that is that I end up apprenticing with an herbalist and
[07:36.070 --> 07:41.470]  I like stayed at her place for a really long time. I can't remember how long. Definitely
[07:41.470 --> 07:46.950]  a couple of months. And she like just took me under her wing. I had my little boy and
[07:46.950 --> 07:53.950]  she showed me so many different things about making medicines. And but to back up a little
[07:54.790 --> 08:01.790]  bit, even when I was in theater and I was in my whole acting thing in L.A., I was completely
[08:02.510 --> 08:07.430]  obsessed with making my own products like I would spend days in the bathroom making
[08:07.430 --> 08:13.590]  products of shampoo and like facial clays and foot baths and like you name it. I've
[08:13.590 --> 08:20.110]  still got recipe cards to this day of that time I spent just really obsessed with self-care.
[08:20.110 --> 08:24.270]  And I think that's kind of like been my journey is been self-care and learning how to take
[08:24.270 --> 08:30.910]  care of myself through diet and this exploration. And that's really my path towards herbalism
[08:30.910 --> 08:36.990]  is just exploration. And so this woman really like shifted my world. Like at this point,
[08:36.990 --> 08:43.990]  I started realizing that I could feel like what the plants were about. And I had studied
[08:46.190 --> 08:53.190]  also with the coven for a little while. And so one of my first introductions into herbs
[08:53.670 --> 09:00.150]  was magical purposes of them. And so I realized during this time when I was studying herbs
[09:00.150 --> 09:04.470]  with the coven and then I started traveling and with the herbs with this woman and learning
[09:04.470 --> 09:10.750]  their medicinal properties and knowing both these sides of them that I felt like I wasn't
[09:10.750 --> 09:16.270]  learning like what I was remembering. And I think that it's for a lot of us. You know,
[09:16.270 --> 09:21.470]  there's a lot of like which herbalists and women and men coming around right now. And
[09:21.470 --> 09:26.830]  you're realizing that it's you can understand what the plants are about. Like you just get
[09:26.830 --> 09:32.070]  a sensation. And I started realizing that there was a really strong connection between
[09:32.190 --> 09:37.990]  the plants and myself and I just get impressions from them and just kind of know what I felt
[09:37.990 --> 09:42.350]  like they needed. And then I would research it later. And I'd be like, Oh, right on. I
[09:42.350 --> 09:47.790]  was kind of on point with what that said. So that just really led me down, starting
[09:47.790 --> 09:54.790]  to study herbs. And but then I mean, my path is, is interesting. And so during the time
[09:55.790 --> 10:02.790]  after being with the herbalist, I was in rainbow gatherings for a while, like I'd follow,
[10:02.790 --> 10:09.310]  you know, the rainbow trail. And in that I ended up being part of calm, which was the
[10:09.310 --> 10:13.590]  healers at rainbow gathering because everyone ended up getting injured or something would
[10:13.590 --> 10:18.190]  happen, especially with the kids. And so I just would always take that role. It just
[10:18.190 --> 10:23.870]  seemed like the role that I would it would just fit me really easily that I would always
[10:23.870 --> 10:30.870]  tend to be in. And so the rainbow gatherings then led me to a horse caravan down in Mexico.
[10:32.950 --> 10:39.950]  And we were that was a really huge part of my transition into like really natural farming
[10:40.550 --> 10:47.550]  and really learning about how to do these really awesome just I don't know, let's see
[10:47.870 --> 10:54.870]  that that time period, let me just kind of go back a little bit. I decided to sell my
[10:55.230 --> 11:01.230]  bus and I was going to have the least amount of footprint on this earth as possible. So
[11:01.230 --> 11:05.750]  even with my two year old son, I think it was three at that point, I got rid of all
[11:05.750 --> 11:09.470]  vehicles. I didn't want to phone the only way you could get ahold of me is through email.
[11:09.470 --> 11:15.350]  I just wanted to disappear and have like the littlest footprint as possible. So on that,
[11:15.350 --> 11:20.790]  I ended up hooking up with the horse caravan in Mexico called Nomads United. And their
[11:20.790 --> 11:27.790]  whole objective was to have no footprint, you know, is to go by horse. And so we went
[11:28.550 --> 11:34.150]  down there and you had to have like skills to join. And so my skills that I came with
[11:34.150 --> 11:39.150]  is I end up becoming a raw chef during some of my travels as well. I know how to cook
[11:39.190 --> 11:46.190]  for like a lot of people. I'm a fire dancer. I also do acro balance. And then I also had
[11:46.230 --> 11:52.870]  the skill I came with knowing some herbs and being able to do some healing. And so we got
[11:52.870 --> 11:58.630]  down there and our whole point in that caravan was to teach environmental education and do
[11:58.630 --> 12:05.550]  circus. And so it was really fun because my two favorite things of environmental science
[12:05.830 --> 12:12.830]  and then acting like theater came together in this like beautiful collection of events.
[12:15.190 --> 12:20.670]  And so we're riding horses. We would go in to these places and like villages and people
[12:20.670 --> 12:26.190]  would ride ahead and kind of scout out where we could go. And there was like 32 of us in
[12:26.190 --> 12:31.230]  this international horse caravan from all over the world. Me and my son were the only
[12:31.270 --> 12:38.270]  ones from the States. So you can see the collection. I mean, everywhere. It was so fun. And so
[12:40.070 --> 12:46.550]  we'd come in and we would teach. We go into schools and like set up recycling stations.
[12:46.550 --> 12:50.510]  And then we would do skits with the kids about, you know, if you put trash in the water, if
[12:50.510 --> 12:55.270]  you put bleach in the water, it goes on down and it kills the animals. So we would do these
[12:55.270 --> 13:01.230]  little skits like that. And at the end of our time there, we would do this big circus
[13:01.230 --> 13:06.190]  event with, you know, we had great musicians, great entertainers with us, and then we would
[13:06.190 --> 13:11.550]  do the magic hat. And so that's how we made our money. And to the next place we went.
[13:11.550 --> 13:17.230]  And I got to be part of making a biodigester where it's like, you know, where you're collecting
[13:17.230 --> 13:22.630]  the poop and you're creating this like it. What we had was these big plastic things at
[13:22.630 --> 13:26.190]  the end. The poop would go in, the methane would raise, and then it would get pumped
[13:26.190 --> 13:31.790]  down into a stove. And people were able to use that. And especially communities were
[13:31.790 --> 13:36.710]  able to set that up so there could be cooking availability, you know, at the time of the
[13:36.710 --> 13:42.590]  year. And that was really fun to be part of. And then we also set up washing stations outside
[13:42.590 --> 13:47.870]  the rivers because especially in some of those smaller villages where even cars couldn't
[13:47.870 --> 13:56.790]  get through that you had people just washing directly into the rivers, like bleach, everything.
[13:56.790 --> 14:01.470]  And so we would set washing stations up a little outside the rivers where people were
[14:01.470 --> 14:06.470]  still going down to the rivers. It's a community thing. But they would be washing their stuff,
[14:06.470 --> 14:12.630]  and it would at least go into the ground before it got to, yeah, before it got to the river.
[14:12.630 --> 14:19.110]  And so that was like a big part of my experience down there was really learning like this just
[14:19.110 --> 14:25.470]  environment like again about being this nature warrior. That's what we were about. And during
[14:25.470 --> 14:31.390]  that time, I mean, it was full on. It sounds cool and fun, but it wasn't. It was intense.
[14:31.390 --> 14:35.390]  There was like I watched a horse fall off a cliff. There was a I mean, there was another
[14:35.390 --> 14:40.110]  time we had to like open up a huge tumor on the side. And that was another thing I was
[14:40.110 --> 14:45.310]  a part of. And then like people fell off like the horses would raise up. Our horses
[14:45.310 --> 14:50.870]  were not that tame, not at all. And one of the girls like slid and from her shoulder
[14:50.870 --> 14:57.070]  to her back, it was completely opened up. And we were in the woods. We literally camped
[14:57.070 --> 15:01.630]  in Petraros like fields. And so we there was a time I hadn't even gone inside for like
[15:01.630 --> 15:08.670]  three months. And so I had to that was like a huge part of my own like learning my intuition.
[15:08.670 --> 15:12.270]  Like I didn't speak the language well, so I couldn't ask other healers there. I had
[15:12.270 --> 15:17.310]  to intuitive what plants were around me that I could use and then just keep it clean as
[15:17.310 --> 15:24.710]  I could. And that was a really big part into like just really trusting and learning herbs
[15:24.710 --> 15:29.670]  and then being part of nature. Like we would have to find when we camp like listen for
[15:29.670 --> 15:33.590]  creeks, you know, listen for the where the water came from because we couldn't camp anywhere
[15:33.590 --> 15:38.190]  there wasn't water. So I learned to like really become aware of my surroundings like
[15:38.190 --> 15:45.750]  so much and it was just a big part of my journey. And it was that caravan and just really walking
[15:45.750 --> 15:53.350]  and tune with nature and it changed everything like we rewired my brain. So like when I when
[15:53.350 --> 16:02.350]  I decided to come back to the States, I was thinking of living in Mexico. Yep. And I had
[16:02.350 --> 16:10.070]  this really deep calling that I decided it was time to get land and it wasn't supposed
[16:10.070 --> 16:14.150]  to be in Mexico. Like I knew I was supposed to come back to the States and do what I was
[16:14.150 --> 16:19.590]  supposed to do here. And I'm still figuring all that out. But it was like it was so strong
[16:19.590 --> 16:29.950]  that I came back me and my son and we we end up living at a community in Texas. And that
[16:29.950 --> 16:34.950]  was really my really big first dive into gardening. Like I had garden doing the work
[16:34.950 --> 16:40.590]  trade and that was all fun and all but my friends decided to leave for the summer and
[16:40.590 --> 16:47.030]  they left me with a half an acre garden, like a full on food producing garden where they
[16:47.030 --> 16:55.510]  had a restaurant on the weekends. And they I was they trusted me enough to like do this
[16:55.510 --> 17:00.390]  and I had no clue what I was doing. I my friends like he was a good friend of mine
[17:00.390 --> 17:05.230]  who had started this this community and I asked him he's like you need to put this irrigation
[17:05.230 --> 17:13.270]  and I'm like put irrigation and he's like download it from the universe. You know how
[17:13.270 --> 17:19.190]  and I was just like, okay, Google right? All right, Google, we got this. And so I literally
[17:19.190 --> 17:25.350]  Googled how to put this fucking drip irrigation in and I fucked up so many times. But that
[17:25.350 --> 17:34.990]  whole garden was I got no I got no guidance. So I just did it. And that was really an experience.
[17:34.990 --> 17:39.350]  And I realized that that was my first time realizing that peppers take like sometimes
[17:39.350 --> 17:44.230]  two to three weeks to sprout and I kept replanting the fucking peppers thinking like what is
[17:44.230 --> 17:49.830]  wrong with these peppers. And there was just so many experiments that went wrong. That
[17:49.830 --> 17:56.190]  was like so many beautiful lessons, you know, and I loved it though. I loved it there. Because
[17:56.190 --> 18:02.830]  he also do what's called industrial harvesting. So we would scan like Craigslist at the time
[18:02.830 --> 18:06.270]  to see you need the free stuff that maybe we could get for the community and go pick
[18:06.270 --> 18:12.030]  up. We would also go around with trailers at night and pick up in the neighborhoods,
[18:12.030 --> 18:19.310]  all the bags of leaves and take the leaves back for mulch. And we also had like the power
[18:19.310 --> 18:23.510]  company come in and dump all their wood chips. And so we were it was really fun because I
[18:23.510 --> 18:27.830]  learned how to do a lot of this like harvesting from the surround what was you know, just
[18:27.830 --> 18:36.430]  using what we can. And but when I was at that community, I also realized like, okay, that
[18:36.430 --> 18:44.550]  was fun. I'm ready to move on from Texas. And I had a friend that was like, really,
[18:44.550 --> 18:48.590]  really adamant about me coming out to California. And I had felt the call for a while and I
[18:48.590 --> 18:53.990]  knew I was going to end up back here. I just I just felt it really at home out here. And
[18:53.990 --> 18:57.230]  he's like, you're gonna come trim. And I was just gonna be great. You're gonna make money.
[18:57.230 --> 19:01.710]  And you know, you can do all your other little I always traveled with different things I
[19:01.710 --> 19:07.070]  made and products and stuff. And he's like, there'll be money here. And he's really convinced
[19:07.070 --> 19:13.230]  me to come out. So I made my way out to California, I baked a bunch of chocolate chip cookies,
[19:13.230 --> 19:19.030]  and I made some like goo ball edibles and I made our gas out to California to trim and
[19:19.030 --> 19:24.590]  but on my way out there, I was like, I had one of those aha moments. I was like, I'm
[19:24.590 --> 19:29.150]  gonna start growing cannabis. It just makes sense. I'm a healer. I've been studying this
[19:29.150 --> 19:34.230]  and studying herbs like cannabis has been such a huge part of my journey. Like I could
[19:34.230 --> 19:40.710]  tear up thinking about it. Like she's helped me she saved my life. And you know, and so
[19:40.710 --> 19:46.830]  I was like, this is it. I know exactly what I'm doing. So I came out to California and
[19:46.830 --> 19:51.190]  each place I trimmed out, they kept putting me separate. So I had a kid with me like my
[19:51.190 --> 19:57.030]  he was four or five at the time. Maybe Yeah, six. I don't remember. Um, yeah, probably
[19:57.030 --> 20:01.390]  about six at that point. And so I had him with me. So I would have the grower just sitting
[20:01.390 --> 20:04.870]  there talking to me and they would answer all my questions because I got lots of questions
[20:04.870 --> 20:11.670]  when I'm learning to learn something. And I just kept doing that from place to place.
[20:11.670 --> 20:19.030]  And I ended up in Lake County. I was that I was in Grass Valley. And we got poison oak
[20:19.030 --> 20:24.870]  like really bad, like so bad. And my friend I was with was like, Okay, we're gonna go
[20:24.870 --> 20:28.870]  to Lake County. I got a brother there. We're gonna heal and I'm like, we're gonna go to
[20:28.870 --> 20:33.590]  Lake County. All right. And so I ended up in Lake County for like two weeks naked with
[20:33.590 --> 20:39.990]  clay on my body. And, and then afterwards, I fell in love with this place because we
[20:39.990 --> 20:45.510]  got hot springs. It's close to like, it's not too far from Shasta. It's close to the
[20:45.510 --> 20:51.310]  city if I want to do the city cultural thing. And it's just beautiful. We have so many like,
[20:51.310 --> 20:56.910]  this beautiful little hidden gems out in Lake County. And luckily I had someone there that
[20:56.910 --> 21:03.310]  took me serious. I have one of my best friends give a shout out to dream Creek farm, Chris.
[21:03.310 --> 21:07.630]  And he really showed me he took me under his wing and knew I was serious about growing
[21:07.630 --> 21:14.390]  cannabis. And that same year, that was like 11 years ago, that I took my first permaculture
[21:14.390 --> 21:21.270]  class. And so then I started bringing in compost teas into our little grower circle. And, and
[21:21.270 --> 21:28.190]  then from there, I've just, it's just really progressed, because then I realized, well,
[21:28.190 --> 21:31.150]  I'm going to do the permaculture way, whereas all the others were like, they didn't want
[21:31.150 --> 21:34.670]  to grow plants inside their pots. You're like, Oh, it takes away nutrients from the
[21:34.670 --> 21:38.790]  cannabis. I'm like, no, no, no, we need more. Let's, let's grow like the florist does. You
[21:38.790 --> 21:44.030]  see how nature does it? Like she's, there's no spot that's like free of like plants usually
[21:44.030 --> 21:49.670]  if she does it right. And so I started bringing in a lot of different plants. And then also
[21:49.670 --> 21:57.550]  just knowing like which ones I wanted to work with and really experimenting with ones that
[21:57.550 --> 22:00.470]  I'd be like, I think this would be pest resistant because it's like, you know, she's really
[22:00.550 --> 22:07.270]  strong with essential oils. And then really diving deep, I met this woman, Dia, Dia Damon
[22:07.270 --> 22:15.110]  from Nomads Landing and Spencer, her partner. And they really clued me in into natural farming
[22:15.110 --> 22:21.390]  into what I mean, natural farming could be a big range of things, but more of like, some
[22:21.390 --> 22:26.190]  of the JADAM techniques of making your own teas and nutrients, because I was spending
[22:26.190 --> 22:34.310]  like 1000s on nutrients, organic, you know, all organic, all perfect, but 1000s. And so
[22:34.310 --> 22:41.990]  they really clued me in on how to make my own. Like calcium teas, my own microbial solutions
[22:41.990 --> 22:46.510]  that I was like spending $800 a bucket on from some place that they probably weren't
[22:46.510 --> 22:51.230]  even alive when they got to my soil after I started understanding a lot. And that was
[22:51.230 --> 22:59.070]  like a really big path of me diving like full on into this microbial world. And, but
[22:59.070 --> 23:04.430]  through it all, yeah, and that's even when I had the beds up. And but through it all,
[23:04.430 --> 23:08.270]  I've still been working with different plants, like I was still obsessed at the end of the
[23:08.270 --> 23:13.670]  year, I'd get so excited, but most of all my shake, shake went into like making solves.
[23:13.670 --> 23:18.550]  And I really had no idea how to do it. I was just like doing it. And I'm really big into
[23:18.550 --> 23:26.390]  like, learning hands on kind of jumping feet first. And so I ended up finally taking a
[23:26.390 --> 23:33.270]  master herbalist class, like online and kind of getting lots of different books about that.
[23:33.270 --> 23:40.750]  And that it's really interesting because my natural farming, like evolution and my herbalist
[23:40.750 --> 23:45.510]  evolution have really gone hands in hand. Because as I learned more about the herbs,
[23:45.510 --> 23:49.510]  the more I'm learning all their different like purposes, like I love putting lemon balm
[23:49.510 --> 23:57.270]  in my garden, because lemon balm is so good for us to help relax our nervous system. It's
[23:57.270 --> 24:02.350]  really good for children given to children. But and it's also an issue too, when you smell
[24:02.350 --> 24:07.550]  it, you kind of get this like uplifting, but like calming feeling. And so then it brings
[24:07.550 --> 24:12.310]  that energy into your garden. But at the same point, it's that's when those smelly herbs,
[24:12.310 --> 24:16.310]  it's pest resistance, and there's not many pests around it, you're looking at it. So I
[24:16.310 --> 24:22.510]  love to grow those close to my cannabis and like, and like line my rows with it. And so those just
[24:22.510 --> 24:28.070]  started really absurd understanding. And because I had started understanding so much about nutrition
[24:28.070 --> 24:32.870]  and my own health, I realized what I was doing with the plants, you know, and I'm giving them
[24:32.870 --> 24:36.910]  cheese, I'm giving them nettle teas, and I'm giving myself nettle teas, I'm giving nettle,
[24:36.910 --> 24:41.350]  horsetail, anything I'm thinking about for making for myself, I'm thinking about making for the
[24:41.350 --> 24:47.110]  plants as well. And so for me, it's just this beautiful, like, you know, symbiology of like,
[24:47.110 --> 24:54.030]  this evolution of natural farming and herbalism. And tomorrow real quick, is there a difference
[24:54.030 --> 24:58.950]  between nettles and stinging nettles? Or is that the same thing? They're the same thing. Mm hmm.
[24:58.950 --> 25:04.550]  There's a there's one called dead nettle. And that's the little purple tops, but it doesn't
[25:04.550 --> 25:09.990]  really have the same makeup as the stinging nettles. And the stinging nettles are really
[25:09.990 --> 25:14.550]  cool, because it's like you can eat I mean, there's so many ways to be able to process them.
[25:14.550 --> 25:20.950]  But even when you're collecting them, the stinging nettle part is really good for circulation. Like
[25:20.950 --> 25:26.310]  it's good when you're harvesting those if you're bare handed with it. They even have this technique
[25:26.310 --> 25:31.070]  that we're reading out in the book, and I've seen I've not tried this yet. But where you take the
[25:31.070 --> 25:36.390]  nettles and you whip your back with it, because it's supposed to like, create that circulation,
[25:36.550 --> 25:42.950]  especially up and down your spine. Like they're really amazing herbs and one of my favorite
[25:42.950 --> 25:47.990]  allies. Yeah, that's something that I feel like you kind of coined the phrase of and then something
[25:47.990 --> 25:53.270]  I wanted to get into hopefully deeper with these stinging nettles, as you were saying that the
[25:53.270 --> 25:58.470]  cannabis plant kind of maybe sees it as some kind of attack, so that you can improve your trichome
[25:58.470 --> 26:01.430]  production. That's something that little gold nugget that I learned from you. Do you mind going
[26:01.430 --> 26:06.310]  deeper in that with our audience? Yeah, definitely. That's one of my favorite things to tell
[26:06.310 --> 26:12.470]  people about. And idea actually told me this, this was a secret she told me and I tried it and it was
[26:12.470 --> 26:17.430]  like you're you grow your stinging nettles right beside your cannabis and I found that it works
[26:17.430 --> 26:23.030]  best like I planted right underneath and I planted on the outside before but I've seen it plant it
[26:23.030 --> 26:28.790]  works really well and you plant it more underneath where it's like the roots are combining together.
[26:28.790 --> 26:33.830]  And it's like there's a defense system like a defense the cannabis puts a defense system up
[26:33.830 --> 26:39.830]  against the nettles and what is cannabis defense system trichomes it produces more trichomes you
[26:39.830 --> 26:46.470]  know it's those crystals and that's its defense system and so I did see study like side by side
[26:46.470 --> 26:53.830]  same strain of the cannabis with the nettles and without the nettles and it was so significantly
[26:53.830 --> 26:58.950]  different. It was like the other was beautiful but this was like you know that just that power
[26:58.950 --> 27:03.670]  it was like all the way to the end of the leaf trying to trichomes and I was like wow that's
[27:03.670 --> 27:09.110]  beautiful but let me show some people too and like I wrote that down but I tried to get the next year
[27:09.110 --> 27:12.870]  and I was like okay let me just see if this is really working and I did another study and it was
[27:13.430 --> 27:17.670]  it was right on and then now I've practiced and I started practicing with you know where I could
[27:17.670 --> 27:22.790]  actually put it and then I found even if it was out here to the side it worked okay but not as
[27:22.790 --> 27:28.390]  much as when I did it right like really underneath the cannabis and really mix those roots and I did
[27:28.390 --> 27:33.510]  I found a significant difference in the trichome production. And you're simply chopping dropping
[27:33.510 --> 27:38.790]  that when it if it gets out of control? Yeah I mean for me I do chop and drop it because it's
[27:38.790 --> 27:45.110]  really good for the soil but I use it all like nettle root is one of the only plants that really
[27:45.110 --> 27:50.950]  helps with testosterone and it's one of there's only like two herbs that help with like the male
[27:50.950 --> 27:57.030]  prostrate and it's nettle root and salt palmetto and so for me if the the nettle gets out of hand
[27:57.030 --> 28:02.550]  I'm just ripping up the roots and I'm making tinctures but the nettle there's so many uses
[28:02.550 --> 28:08.150]  for it it's like if it gets out of hand yes because you could right you could fill up a 50
[28:08.150 --> 28:12.630]  gallon barrel with that and feed that to your plants that is so much nitrogen that's so many
[28:12.630 --> 28:17.590]  minerals and vitamins that's what I feel like my plants just like absolutely love they get super
[28:17.590 --> 28:22.790]  green when I'm feeding them that and then for ourselves like we can put that in soup we can put
[28:22.790 --> 28:27.910]  make a tease out of it you know like I every day I have nettles I powder my nettles and make a
[28:27.910 --> 28:32.310]  smoothie mix out of that with a bunch of other herbs and then throughout the day I'm drinking
[28:32.310 --> 28:37.590]  nettle and horsetail those two are like two of my main favorites and those are two great ones for
[28:37.590 --> 28:45.190]  the plants as well so because you're adding silica with your um horsetail and so for me if it get
[28:45.750 --> 28:50.870]  getting out of hand is like a bonus and it doesn't happen because I feel like that's one of the
[28:50.870 --> 28:55.830]  things I really try to cultivate. Leighton have you heard of that little gold nugget there is that
[28:55.830 --> 29:02.310]  a new one? That is a new one growing the nettles to create the defenses and Brian have you ever
[29:02.310 --> 29:09.270]  harvested nettle yourself? No I haven't um I used to use stinging nettle um for it was supposed to
[29:09.270 --> 29:14.870]  help me with allergies um but to be honest with you it didn't really work but I don't know if my
[29:14.870 --> 29:19.910]  source was exactly where it should have been I got it from a like a farmer's markets flea market kind
[29:19.910 --> 29:24.550]  of thing. Yeah you gotta you gotta get out in the field and actually harvest it what she says is so
[29:24.550 --> 29:29.910]  true I mean you get zinged all over your hands and you're kind of like it hurts but it doesn't really
[29:29.910 --> 29:35.990]  hurt but it definitely stimulates your your circulation. I love to put it in compost for the
[29:35.990 --> 29:40.710]  for the same reason she's talking about there's just so many good properties with nettle it's
[29:40.710 --> 29:46.550]  just an amazing plant but that was a really great gold bar as far as polyculture is concerned and
[29:46.550 --> 29:50.710]  there are probably other plants that'll do the same thing that just maybe haven't been discovered
[29:52.070 --> 29:57.110]  well and she's a big proponent of like trap plants right and and that kind of thing and just kind of
[29:57.110 --> 30:02.710]  building up your entire garden with mother nature um I know you're really getting in or you know you
[30:02.710 --> 30:08.630]  have been into hugel culture um I would love to kind of kind of go down that road and um Layton
[30:08.630 --> 30:12.950]  if there's other stuff that you can add into this I hope that we can really dive deep in this for the
[30:12.950 --> 30:18.070]  audience today um Pauline was just talking to me she wants to add something about nettles so I
[30:18.070 --> 30:23.990]  missed what you said can you repeat that Brian uh that's all right go ahead and say with that and um
[30:23.990 --> 30:30.390]  no she's just she's gonna go freshen up a little bit but yes trap plants and banker plants are
[30:30.390 --> 30:35.990]  critical um you know I'm using them at the ranch I'm using them on other projects because they
[30:35.990 --> 30:42.790]  bring in the indigenous you know predators which are so important and if there's no space for them
[30:43.190 --> 30:48.870]  on your farm your ranch whatever then they're not going to come and support your your your
[30:48.870 --> 30:55.350]  monoculture or your polyculture so it's uh it's you know I I can't stress enough having those
[30:55.350 --> 31:01.830]  companion plants trap plants banker plants and for the audience a banker plant is something that
[31:01.830 --> 31:08.390]  attracts and kind of think of it like a bank it stores these insects these predators a trap plant
[31:08.390 --> 31:14.470]  is a great plant to have an indicator of potential pressure so as the aphids move in and out that's
[31:14.470 --> 31:18.950]  the first thing they're going to do is land on that trap plant so as long as you're keeping an
[31:18.950 --> 31:24.310]  eye on that trap plant you know what's going on around you but they can also be very dangerous
[31:24.310 --> 31:28.710]  because if you don't keep an eye on that trap plant the insects are going to get out of control
[31:28.710 --> 31:33.190]  on that and then spread to your cash crop so it's one of those things that it's a double-edged
[31:33.190 --> 31:40.230]  you're not careful um so yeah definitely big big proponent of polyculture you know adding different
[31:40.230 --> 31:44.870]  plants you know you like the old put a pepper plant next to your tomato plant you'll get a
[31:44.870 --> 31:49.750]  wonderful tomato it'll have a little spice a little heat to it you know those are just one
[31:49.750 --> 31:55.190]  of a billion tricks of getting plants to work in harmony with each other so i'm going to spin
[31:55.190 --> 32:04.630]  this around so pauline can be seen all right there you go looking good babe
[32:06.630 --> 32:16.550]  hi good morning sorry i'm just starting to move uh so um i'm a stage four ovarian cancer survivor
[32:16.550 --> 32:23.590]  and i'm in a metastasis right now and i'm going through some new treatment and uh i work very
[32:23.590 --> 32:29.830]  very closely with a natural path and one of the things that mitigates the side effects of
[32:30.470 --> 32:42.470]  treatment is metal and um so you know taking um i take uh seven 21 21 metal uh
[32:44.950 --> 32:48.070]  and it's between metal and um
[32:48.870 --> 32:54.390]  um uh frankincense is another
[33:06.390 --> 33:11.190]  which you'll have to look up i'm not i'm not sure the latin name for that but all of these
[33:11.190 --> 33:17.350]  plants that you're talking about um can be grown along these plants and these are plants that we
[33:18.790 --> 33:23.830]  just just quickly late and i think the microphone's on you and we can hear you clanking away
[33:25.510 --> 33:30.950]  all right i'll scoot scoot in honey get get a little bit closer to the to the computer because
[33:30.950 --> 33:37.910]  this is i don't know layton do you do you have like you sound crystal clear so you have the
[33:37.910 --> 33:43.670]  microphone so you need to stand next to pauline i don't it's it's the computer so i just don't
[33:43.750 --> 33:48.950]  ever close enough to the computer oh okay all right cool carry take it away pauline
[33:50.630 --> 33:57.910]  did you hear anything we we heard it we just heard a lot of i think it was just stacking boxes or
[33:57.910 --> 34:07.350]  something i was trying to move they forgot we're live on youtube anyway so you know all of these
[34:07.350 --> 34:12.790]  these plants i'm so happy you i heard the end of this conversation as i was getting up because
[34:12.870 --> 34:18.870]  these plants you know that you're talking about that can be grown along all of everything you're
[34:18.870 --> 34:26.070]  doing in the cannabis industry and the organic regenerative um properties of these you know
[34:26.070 --> 34:34.950]  these are desperately needed you know for like right now genistein there is genistein is probably
[34:35.030 --> 34:44.390]  the number one thing we need uh for cancer to mitigate side effects and i can't get any um you
[34:44.390 --> 34:52.950]  know because i buy it wholesale and uh in powder form and it's it's back order till november which
[34:52.950 --> 35:00.630]  is really wigging me out so you know these are the things that you know i mean if we could get
[35:00.630 --> 35:08.630]  the cannabis industry wrapped around you know planting all of these plants around their cannabis
[35:08.630 --> 35:14.790]  plants not only will it give the cannabis plant their properties of everything they have to heal
[35:14.790 --> 35:21.510]  which is healing me i mean look at my hair you know it's not falling out right you know and i'm
[35:21.510 --> 35:27.910]  having some pretty serious treatment you know it's not yet and i'm hoping it won't and it doesn't
[35:27.910 --> 35:32.870]  matter it's just hair but you know these are things that we think about you know that we have
[35:32.870 --> 35:39.830]  to go through uh you know as as people surviving and i think you make a really really incredibly
[35:39.830 --> 35:46.390]  valuable point as cannabis industry the regenerative farmers are getting killed by the price of pounds
[35:46.390 --> 35:52.710]  of weed because of the fucking middlemen here's a great way to subsidize their income like growing
[35:52.710 --> 35:58.070]  these critical plants and then getting a collective together to sell it to people who need
[35:58.070 --> 36:04.230]  it and then maybe starting a collective where you sell it to you know to to industries you know that
[36:04.230 --> 36:09.910]  are buying and reselling a natural cast and that but then you have another industry for people like
[36:09.910 --> 36:17.510]  me who are completely broke because i'm spending two thousand dollars a month on herbs right i mean
[36:17.510 --> 36:23.830]  that's more than most people spend on their mortgage so you know i'm just this this is just
[36:23.830 --> 36:30.790]  this is so dear to my heart and and you know this is my my goal when i get out of this when i'm when
[36:30.790 --> 36:36.310]  i'm rocking and rolling again man this this is where i'm going you know let's let's do all this
[36:36.310 --> 36:42.950]  together right it's not just about a cannabis plant because i use cannabis and i advocate for
[36:43.030 --> 36:50.710]  it and really really heavily but i have a real low tolerance for thc so i can't do you know you
[36:50.710 --> 36:56.230]  know i did suppositories high suppositories for two and a half years and that really helped the
[36:56.230 --> 37:05.190]  first round but now because of the build-up in my system if i do any more than a 0.35 of a gram
[37:05.190 --> 37:12.790]  suppository i will convulse on the floor of thc i'll i'll be on the floor and i'm like this
[37:12.870 --> 37:21.430]  i can't talk about your gopher yeah and yeah and so you know i i just set up another go fund me
[37:21.430 --> 37:28.390]  because you know this everything goes out the window so so quickly layton's been just
[37:29.590 --> 37:36.630]  my love you know supporting me in the last couple of years with this so you know every little bit
[37:36.630 --> 37:41.910]  helps every little bit helps so we'll we'll get the information we'll get the information to you
[37:41.910 --> 37:49.270]  but really what will help in the long run for everyone you know when i'm long gone is is
[37:49.830 --> 37:57.190]  planting natural herbs and i've already given a list out once i will send it out again and if you
[37:57.190 --> 38:04.870]  know if all of you all of you cannabis farmers who i know and love would just plant just a couple of
[38:04.870 --> 38:11.670]  these you know in your acreage it will make a huge difference and it will help you supplement
[38:11.670 --> 38:17.190]  what are the main plants they should be planting these are these are what i was trying to join the
[38:17.190 --> 38:24.390]  scene genistein here let me just get a list yeah because i've to be honest i've never heard of
[38:24.390 --> 38:31.030]  genistein i'm sure you go get her list and uh and then she could put it out there on the air again
[38:31.670 --> 38:36.950]  but they're not hard to grow these are these are companion plants uh they're small they're herbs
[38:37.110 --> 38:42.070]  they don't get out of control you already already know about nettle and the other side of this too
[38:42.070 --> 38:47.910]  is that as cannabis growers you understand how to process plants a lot of these people just you know
[38:47.910 --> 38:54.710]  farmers they know how to grow stuff but they don't know how to cure and curing in cannabis is critical
[38:54.710 --> 39:02.310]  well curing in herbology is just as critical the way you dry it the way you package it so that it
[39:02.310 --> 39:08.550]  doesn't lose the the power that it has that it's pulled out of the earth both in an energy and as
[39:08.550 --> 39:15.430]  far as minerals and nutrients are concerned so you know that's where you guys are are a cut above a
[39:15.430 --> 39:21.350]  lot of these farms that are just mass producing whether it's food or herbs or anything else
[39:21.350 --> 39:27.270]  they don't have the curing part they don't understand how to take care of that plant and
[39:27.270 --> 39:33.190]  make sure that it doesn't lose its effectiveness um over the course of time after it after it's
[39:33.190 --> 39:38.390]  been harvested you know i can't stress that enough and that's always been you know a big thing that
[39:38.950 --> 39:44.470]  you know pauline was at the den pure hive meeting and you know she brought that out as a as a thing
[39:44.470 --> 39:49.910]  you know for people to really start wrapping their head around and when i heard from both
[39:49.910 --> 39:54.790]  wendy and some other people up in humble about that you know the devastating prices of of
[39:55.670 --> 40:00.390]  regenerative cannabis huge nuggets and they get three to five hundred dollars a pound
[40:00.390 --> 40:07.350]  you go down to these freaking stores these these freaking dispensaries that are supposed to be
[40:07.350 --> 40:12.310]  giving you good product and it's little tiny popcorn nugs and they're charging shit ton for it
[40:12.310 --> 40:17.590]  and the second hit tastes like crap so you know it's grown in salt so i you know it's just it's
[40:17.590 --> 40:23.510]  it's such a frustrating thing and i i truly believe that as the industry shakes itself out
[40:23.510 --> 40:28.470]  because even the hundred acre farm up in santa barbara they're not going to make a huge profit
[40:29.030 --> 40:33.830]  they flooded the market they kind of fucked themselves because they put too much out there
[40:33.830 --> 40:37.670]  so they're going to get pushed out of pushed out of the game so it's just a matter of figuring out
[40:37.670 --> 40:43.350]  how to stabilize your income long enough to keep you in the game so you don't lose your permits
[40:43.350 --> 40:48.870]  you don't lose your farm or all your hard work and here's a great way of doing it um you know
[40:48.870 --> 40:55.990]  another one is garlic garlic's a critical one um you know it's not hard to grow it really isn't
[40:56.550 --> 41:01.030]  um and she's still working on this list over here but i didn't mean to go on a rant
[41:02.310 --> 41:08.390]  tomorrow why don't you why don't you comment on some of that stuff oh i would love to like
[41:08.390 --> 41:15.430]  everything pauline said about growing the herbs with the cannabis and how they're so needed like
[41:15.430 --> 41:23.030]  yes i am so much in agreement and alignment and like our there is a shortage of herbs like as an
[41:23.030 --> 41:29.270]  herbalist like i claim that you know like labels and stuff but it's like one who works with plants
[41:29.830 --> 41:35.510]  and and makes medicine from them the last year there was i couldn't find anything like i could
[41:35.510 --> 41:40.630]  not get a hold of the herbs i needed to make some of the medicines and so i had to switch which was
[41:40.630 --> 41:45.750]  really interesting and good i had to find more natives more things that i could wild harvest
[41:45.750 --> 41:52.870]  but the more herbs we can grow there's like we can't grow enough and so that is like a huge part
[41:52.870 --> 41:58.630]  of what we're doing and like even after i remember talking to pauline she was a huge like i was
[41:58.630 --> 42:02.150]  already on this thing i'm like i'm gonna grow tons of herbs and i'm gonna grow for my products and i
[42:02.150 --> 42:08.230]  want to because for me cannabis is amazing medicine but it's a catalyst for so many others and when
[42:08.230 --> 42:14.070]  you put this other herbs together different ones for different purposes it i mean that is when the
[42:14.070 --> 42:20.310]  healing really takes place i feel and like cannabis is a huge even the cbd between the ranges you know
[42:20.310 --> 42:25.350]  it depends like on the person everybody is different but you add that in and it's another
[42:25.350 --> 42:31.830]  element it just activates it more it makes the medicine sometimes i feel stronger um but we need
[42:31.910 --> 42:37.190]  more herbs and i feel like the more we can make it's also a you know that there's just
[42:39.190 --> 42:44.550]  we can't grow enough you know and i did put i remember a few years ago when i first started in
[42:44.550 --> 42:50.230]  the dm i put a list out that i was looking for and i'm and like a couple times i keep pushing and i'm
[42:50.230 --> 42:55.190]  gonna keep pushing it too because it's like we need to create an herb collective within us and
[42:55.190 --> 43:01.750]  there's a lot of farmers um that are growing a bunch of beautiful herbs and are doing it an
[43:01.750 --> 43:08.550]  amazing way on in the dm collective so it'd be really amazing i think to create a dm herb
[43:08.550 --> 43:16.470]  collective um but yeah if you can grow the and what i'm looking at is um what are some higher
[43:16.470 --> 43:20.710]  price looking herbs that you can use that are also super foods i'd love i look forward to hearing this
[43:20.710 --> 43:26.390]  list again because i know i've got this list from pauline um from before but like i was looking at
[43:26.390 --> 43:30.630]  some others that i use for some of my products or what are the super foods that i use daily like
[43:30.630 --> 43:34.870]  moringa moringa is an easy plant to grow all you're doing is harvesting the leaves and you're
[43:34.870 --> 43:41.190]  making a powder of it that's a super food and so stuff like this is like and then also growing your
[43:41.190 --> 43:48.550]  at-risk herbs like there's um golden silk which is a really powerful antiviral antifungal
[43:48.550 --> 43:55.510]  antibacterial you know it's powerful it's what i actually um helped i like the word cure but i
[43:55.510 --> 44:03.270]  helped another body heal from staph from a systemic staph infection with golden sill and honey
[44:03.270 --> 44:08.390]  and those are powerful herbs and then your ginseng as well like anything that's at risk
[44:08.950 --> 44:13.670]  grow that because we need more of it in this world there's reasons why it's at risk people
[44:13.670 --> 44:19.910]  have taken it so much because it's so so powerful medicine but now it's depleted in the wild so
[44:19.910 --> 44:24.870]  we're needing to grow these um but yes i'm looking forward to hearing your list again pauline
[44:26.390 --> 44:33.910]  okay so um all mushrooms you know dragonfly earth medicine is a good good is a good site
[44:34.470 --> 44:40.870]  to go on and see what they're growing because they're they're they have a five uh blend uh
[44:40.870 --> 44:47.750]  mushroom blend that's incredible and they're okay they're getting really good money right so for
[44:47.750 --> 44:55.350]  250 300 caplets it's 250 bucks that's a good supplement for you right there mushrooms right
[44:55.910 --> 45:03.910]  so all my turkey tail reishi turkey tail is a must reishi all mushrooms another one
[45:04.470 --> 45:14.230]  if you grow a tea chaga tea chaga tea is a mushroom is also a mushroom yeah um garlic
[45:14.230 --> 45:22.230]  you mentioned we need god i take garlic in in right now for for my um for my protocol um for
[45:22.790 --> 45:31.830]  for for this uh new for these new infusions uh garlic corsetin um corsetin is another one that
[45:31.830 --> 45:40.630]  uh is is mitigate side effects of all cancer treatment and cancer treatment nettle neem leaf
[45:41.670 --> 45:49.110]  um and then something called this is new that i'm taking it's called ip6 and this company all right
[45:49.110 --> 45:56.070]  to give you an example this is pure uh but to give you an example of the difference between if you
[45:56.070 --> 46:04.310]  sell wholesale or if you sell it to a wholesaler that will retail it so my the genistein that i
[46:04.310 --> 46:11.510]  had been buying from a company um honey can you get in the second drawer there's a little bottle
[46:11.510 --> 46:19.670]  of genistein so i can see where i get it from i was buying this you know retail uh 60 caplets for
[46:19.670 --> 46:29.590]  um i think 60 bucks it's halfway back yeah and uh and i take 24 a day right that's eight
[46:29.590 --> 46:38.310]  caplets a day so you figure that's two grams a day right i was paying for 330 days worth
[46:39.110 --> 46:47.350]  7600 a year oh my god wholesale i found a place that wholesales at a pharmacy
[46:47.910 --> 46:53.430]  uh who also does for veterinarians which is a great place she's a wonderful person it's a family
[46:53.430 --> 46:58.470]  owned it's in it's in new york um and i'm not going to give out the name right now because
[46:58.470 --> 47:03.350]  because i'm going to be selfish because i i really need my stuff right now so i'll give it out
[47:03.350 --> 47:10.550]  when i get my stuff you'll you'll all get the name but wholesale i can buy it in powder for
[47:10.550 --> 47:19.430]  2600 for the same amount so this is the kind of markup you guys can get if you choose to do it
[47:20.150 --> 47:29.990]  right so genistein this is vital nutrients this this bottle is is 55 a bottle i go through these
[47:29.990 --> 47:38.550]  i go through 10 of these bottles a month right mastica this is a new one that i'm taking
[47:39.510 --> 47:47.590]  um and this is actually from it's called kiosk gum mastic and it's from the resins uh material
[47:47.590 --> 47:56.790]  obtained from the pistachio uh lentis lentiscus tree in greece now i don't know how we're going
[47:56.790 --> 48:04.310]  to get that grown here but that's something new that on that i'm taking that that is really
[48:04.310 --> 48:13.510]  powerful and i believe it's it's helping tremendously um and um you know all of these
[48:13.510 --> 48:20.630]  for instance the garlic will normalize your thrombin uh the neem leaf will reduce regulatory
[48:20.950 --> 48:28.150]  cells your ip6 will normalize your tgf right these are things that sound foreign to you
[48:28.150 --> 48:34.790]  but to people who really study and and understand their their cancer they will know what i'm talking
[48:34.790 --> 48:44.310]  about right uh the um their biomarkers their mastica is going to lower your fibrinogen
[48:44.310 --> 48:50.710]  and the nettle herb will normalize your crp and you know when you're going through treatment
[48:51.830 --> 48:58.230]  it's really important to be part of your treatment you know you don't just put your arm out and say
[48:58.230 --> 49:03.190]  which is what most people do and that's why when they when i walk in they go oh god here she comes
[49:05.030 --> 49:09.030]  because i ask questions i want to know what are you putting in my body
[49:09.910 --> 49:15.350]  why are you putting a steroid in my body and how do i mitigate the side effects of that steroid
[49:16.790 --> 49:22.630]  every week i get a steroid put in my body and that's just pummeling my immune system along
[49:22.630 --> 49:31.110]  with the chemo right so these are things that all of you as growers can think about you know i mean
[49:31.110 --> 49:36.710]  how am i going to keep my business and how am i going to keep my plants and how am i going to keep
[49:36.710 --> 49:45.750]  my my livelihood this is a perfect way to do it and you're helping people to stay alive literally
[49:46.390 --> 49:56.950]  what about a beautiful thing right so okay well said pauline what is uh what are those herbs doing
[49:56.950 --> 50:02.710]  in the body like when you take genistein and then the chaga teas and all that is that just
[50:02.710 --> 50:10.390]  building your immune system is that feeding the this your body at the cellular level yes so so
[50:10.390 --> 50:17.430]  you know when i said it's normalizing my thrombin it's it's regular it's it's regulating my my um
[50:17.990 --> 50:28.230]  my my um uh i'm sorry you know i'm a little just waking up so i'm not in my medical
[50:28.950 --> 50:39.190]  no my t-cells right it's it's boosting my immune system it's helping my regulatory system
[50:40.230 --> 50:50.870]  my body to build itself to fight this beautiful beast that's what i call her you know i don't speak
[50:50.870 --> 50:57.750]  meanly to my cancer you know she's a gift she came to me because i needed to change
[50:58.550 --> 51:02.870]  pretty drastically a lot of things in my life emotionally spiritually and physically
[51:03.670 --> 51:10.070]  and in the last three years i've i've pretty much done that everything and now it's time you know
[51:10.070 --> 51:16.070]  that you know she's saying okay i'm back i'm showing you i'm back there's a few things you
[51:16.070 --> 51:21.750]  got to do and i'm doing them and you know she's she's she's listening you know she's
[51:22.710 --> 51:29.670]  you know and it's a really odd thing because when you have your body working in optimal right i mean
[51:29.670 --> 51:37.910]  i was literally in the hospital last week i went in my hemoglobin was point six was 6.8 my hemoglobin
[51:37.910 --> 51:44.790]  that's your blood right i had to get two blood transfusions my iron was two
[51:46.310 --> 51:53.910]  i shouldn't have been standing my zinc was 50 percent right and we won't even go into that
[51:54.470 --> 51:58.630]  talk about political how they treated me because i didn't have a covid test
[51:59.910 --> 52:05.830]  was absolutely over the top i should tell this story really quickly because this is what we
[52:05.830 --> 52:12.310]  deal with in the medical system right now so i went in to the emergency room i'm in in the in
[52:12.310 --> 52:20.790]  in the most pristine hospital in beverly hills at california and walk in and we were having a great
[52:20.790 --> 52:25.830]  time my girlfriend was with me everybody in the er was wonderful they were laughing we were you
[52:25.830 --> 52:30.550]  know i'm getting in the transfusion and all of a sudden they said well we need to admit you
[52:31.110 --> 52:36.630]  have you know you're fine right you had vaccine and i said excuse me they said well you need a
[52:36.630 --> 52:44.950]  covid swab i said is it mandatory and the nurse didn't answer me and he said why don't you want
[52:44.950 --> 52:51.910]  it and i said well i would prefer not to get it i have not had one yet anything and i'm and i stay
[52:51.910 --> 53:00.150]  by myself i don't go out very much and they said well you know you need to get that they said okay
[53:00.150 --> 53:05.590]  he said okay and he walked out i said well okay everything's fine two hours later he comes back
[53:05.590 --> 53:13.430]  whole attitude change and he said miss pauline since you refused the covid swab i said don't
[53:13.430 --> 53:17.510]  you put words in my mouth i never refused anything i asked you if it was mandatory you
[53:17.510 --> 53:23.350]  didn't answer me he said well since you refused the covid swab we are putting you on the covid floor
[53:25.350 --> 53:28.230]  i looked at him and i said could you please repeat yourself
[53:28.950 --> 53:32.390]  he said well since you refused the covid swab we're putting you on the covid floor
[53:33.190 --> 53:40.150]  i said so you are taking a person who's just about walking dead in your emergency room
[53:40.150 --> 53:43.990]  and you're going to put me on a floor to make sure that i die
[53:46.390 --> 53:52.390]  and he just looked at me and he goes and i said fine give me the fucking swab just like that
[53:53.270 --> 53:59.350]  and so he walked out and now the nurses are coming in everyone's attitude has changed toward me
[53:59.350 --> 54:08.230]  everyone i am now the bitch in the room and so the nurse comes in and she she opens the swab up
[54:08.870 --> 54:16.470]  and the head nurse comes in from the er and looks at me she goes miss pauline she goes i said listen
[54:16.470 --> 54:23.830]  i'm okay i'm okay with this i'm fine let's do it i'm and this is how i talked i said absolutely
[54:23.830 --> 54:31.830]  okay i came to terms with it i needed help if she said you do want to get on the right floor don't
[54:31.830 --> 54:45.030]  you these were their words to me as i'm laying there vulnerable in their emergency room just
[54:45.030 --> 54:56.660]  about dying oh yeah and then they shoved they shoved that thing so far up my nose and into my
[54:56.660 --> 55:03.860]  eye i could feel it going into my sinus i could feel it going into my eye i can't read for more
[55:03.860 --> 55:14.520]  than 15 minutes at a time now i can't see out of my eye this is what's happening in our medical system
[55:15.000 --> 55:17.790]  it's awful
[55:20.110 --> 55:29.310]  i'm sorry to hear that happen to you yeah me too but i'm here and you know under the grace of god
[55:29.310 --> 55:34.910]  i will remain here and i will fight this fight for all the people who don't know how because most
[55:34.910 --> 55:41.070]  people don't have my background and most people don't understand that they have the the best
[55:41.230 --> 55:49.310]  the the best advocate is their body if they listen and their best advocate is their voice
[55:49.310 --> 55:57.790]  they have a voice we can all say no if we all just said no right no this doesn't feel good
[55:57.790 --> 56:05.950]  this doesn't feel right i don't want to do this i mean 47 of our health care professionals are
[56:05.950 --> 56:12.830]  not vaccinated what is that telling you they know a lot more than we do and i don't care if
[56:12.830 --> 56:18.590]  you're vaccinated or not do whatever makes you fucking happy whatever makes you happy do it
[56:19.550 --> 56:25.950]  but don't put it on me it's not my job to take care of you and it's not your job to take care of
[56:25.950 --> 56:35.790]  me and that's how i feel so you know things are all falling apart and they have to and now we
[56:35.790 --> 56:44.750]  can all put them back together the regenerative organic way and that's my feel all right i'm not
[56:44.750 --> 56:54.670]  gonna cry anymore fuck yeah well i feel like tomorrow to talk more on what she was you know
[56:54.670 --> 57:01.070]  getting into i mean what's weird to me is that no one really does talk about the immune system or
[57:01.310 --> 57:08.430]  how the body actually fights that and i do feel like that's something that as a family you know
[57:08.430 --> 57:13.790]  i believe we all have children on this show right now so you know we just want to pass on something
[57:13.790 --> 57:17.790]  you know as a as a father as a mother you just want to give your kids something better than you
[57:17.790 --> 57:23.230]  had and i feel like a lot of parents today think that's material things when a lot of the food that
[57:23.230 --> 57:29.150]  they're giving is just trash it's kind of like a second thought thing i see a lot of people even
[57:29.150 --> 57:35.470]  kind of eating on the go a lot so one of the main things i kind of get more back into like growing
[57:35.470 --> 57:39.790]  and stuff is it seems like that hugel culture like you're getting into if you have a piece of land
[57:39.790 --> 57:43.710]  you know it might even be just like an acre or two if you could just get get a piece of land where
[57:43.710 --> 57:48.510]  you can do what you want with it without an hoa coming like that's where i live right now is
[57:48.510 --> 57:54.430]  hoa doesn't let you do anything so it's kind of like yeah you have a you have a house but i still
[57:54.430 --> 58:00.430]  have a in a weird way like a landlord that lets me i have to you know send a letter if i want to
[58:00.430 --> 58:05.310]  paint paint the deck or something like that so they don't really let anything other than golf
[58:05.310 --> 58:10.510]  course kind of things which is horrible obviously for the environment so i wanted to go more into
[58:10.510 --> 58:16.350]  the hugel culture side of things getting more into what pauline is saying like what are some of those
[58:16.350 --> 58:19.790]  because once you've set that up from what i understand i mean that could be a permanent
[58:19.790 --> 58:23.710]  thing you could pass that on to your you know your children and your children's children kind
[58:23.710 --> 58:32.750]  of thing so i was hoping we could go deeper into that yeah um we'll go into that for sure because
[58:32.750 --> 58:39.470]  there's there's like deep meanings behind like why i know we set up the hugel cultures why i felt so
[58:39.470 --> 58:47.870]  passionately about it and um it really gets down to like we're growing for me the herbs are really
[58:47.870 --> 58:52.910]  about really about our health and like i said that's one of my passions is health and it's like
[58:52.910 --> 58:59.470]  i feel like one of my probably my purposes here is to do but the thing is too is that i'm also
[58:59.470 --> 59:05.950]  fucking radical about natural health like i'm not into taking any over-the-counter shit i'm
[59:05.950 --> 59:11.390]  into making my own you know products i'm very much a radical i don't go to doctors like my kids are
[59:11.390 --> 59:18.030]  so fucking healthy and like we don't see doctors i'm not opposed to it if it has to happen but it's
[59:18.030 --> 59:24.910]  like we just don't and for me that is because our immune system is strong and i like i made reasons
[59:24.910 --> 59:31.310]  why i live like on 120 acres with nobody around and like pure water coming out of the ground
[59:31.950 --> 59:38.350]  and why the reason now i've got these hugels and it's like the better you can grow and put
[59:38.350 --> 59:46.910]  yourself in purity the better your immune system is going to be so for me i had to learn how to
[59:46.910 --> 59:53.790]  grow on rock like i found my mountain sanctuary but i have pure water coming out of the ground
[59:53.790 --> 59:59.390]  and a couple places i have three creeks running through um and there's water that's coming out
[59:59.390 --> 01:00:04.590]  of the mountain the calistoga spring like less it's like not even a half a mile from my house
[01:00:04.590 --> 01:00:10.750]  and then i have hot springs about 15 minutes for me for me water's fucking everything and so when
[01:00:10.750 --> 01:00:16.270]  i was decided to settle down i wanted a place that was like close enough to towns you know i could
[01:00:16.270 --> 01:00:22.510]  make it there but it was all really about like i want purity i want to know like what i'm breathing
[01:00:22.510 --> 01:00:28.750]  what i'm drinking what i'm taking in is of the highest quality it possibly can be and that's
[01:00:28.750 --> 01:00:33.710]  really hard in this day and age to have health like there's still like fucking planes that fly
[01:00:33.710 --> 01:00:38.990]  over me you know chemtrails going on there's still all this stuff that we still have to deal with on
[01:00:38.990 --> 01:00:46.270]  a basis so the hugel cultures for me was this evolution of trying to figure out how am i going
[01:00:46.270 --> 01:00:52.510]  to grow on this piece of rock that i'm literally on and but i've got different pockets around like
[01:00:53.310 --> 01:00:59.950]  i have serpentine rock like really heavy deposits of serpentine in certain places and others i don't
[01:00:59.950 --> 01:01:08.750]  i have like more clay and um so i uh through it it's like for me i realized the hugel culture was
[01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:14.590]  the way for me to really build soil and if i'm building soil from my own land and like these
[01:01:14.590 --> 01:01:19.870]  materials i know that i'm gathering and stuff that i know it's at the highest quality possible and
[01:01:19.870 --> 01:01:26.510]  that my food and my medicine is going to be of the highest possible like quality and that's what i'm
[01:01:26.510 --> 01:01:33.630]  like that's my objective is for my medicine and my food to like have nutrients in it again because
[01:01:33.630 --> 01:01:39.390]  so much of our food doesn't have nutrients like you can eat like five tomatoes from the store and
[01:01:39.390 --> 01:01:45.070]  it is so not compared to when you eat your biodynamic you know fresh like regenerative
[01:01:45.070 --> 01:01:52.430]  created tomato with all of its flavors and stuff in it so you know i just wanted to comment on the
[01:01:52.830 --> 01:01:57.390]  culture because you know that's the thing is a lot of people don't understand hugel culture is
[01:01:57.390 --> 01:02:02.830]  built on top of the soil a lot of people dig the holes and then bury it and that's the exact
[01:02:02.830 --> 01:02:06.910]  opposite of what you want to do in a high clay soil because you're just building an anaerobic
[01:02:07.630 --> 01:02:13.950]  cauldron so you know what you've done is amazing because you didn't have soil that would accept and
[01:02:13.950 --> 01:02:19.790]  hold moisture you had rock you went on top of it which is that's exactly where hugel culture came
[01:02:19.790 --> 01:02:25.150]  from in the dramatic culture was that they build these things on top of the ground plant them
[01:02:25.710 --> 01:02:30.430]  take off for six months and when they came back there was this beautiful garden to harvest from
[01:02:30.430 --> 01:02:35.070]  and all the food that they needed so that i just wanted to make that point to the audience so they
[01:02:35.070 --> 01:02:42.110]  understand how to use hugel culture again unless you test your soil to see how well it drains
[01:02:42.110 --> 01:02:47.310]  you should not be burying the logs you should be building a mound so sorry sorry to go on a rant
[01:02:48.270 --> 01:02:54.270]  i know it's actually kind of funny because i have both at my place and i've got reasons for it so
[01:02:54.270 --> 01:02:59.150]  sometimes i feel like it's like dependent on like your environment and what you're working with
[01:02:59.150 --> 01:03:05.470]  so for like the area that i found so let me go back a little bit because my hugel culture
[01:03:05.470 --> 01:03:12.830]  is another evolution i feel like as my property is evolving i'm evolving too as a person but i
[01:03:12.830 --> 01:03:18.030]  first came out there and i built beds i built eight by eight foot beds and that's what i grew
[01:03:18.030 --> 01:03:22.190]  all my cannabis in were these giant fucking eight by eight foot beds and one plant per
[01:03:22.830 --> 01:03:28.190]  so i had this going on for a long time and i'd mix all my plants and and stuff and but i knew
[01:03:28.190 --> 01:03:32.510]  that i wanted to connect the beds somehow and i hadn't really figured that out i did not learn
[01:03:33.070 --> 01:03:38.750]  hugel cultures in my permaculture class i started understanding that i went to a couple communities
[01:03:38.750 --> 01:03:44.750]  that had it and i just didn't really get it um i was working on them but i was just like no one
[01:03:44.750 --> 01:03:50.750]  could explain it to me and it wasn't until i really got into our dm circle and um moongazer
[01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:56.430]  were the people who uh did my certification and i was so excited because i wanted i went into their
[01:03:56.430 --> 01:04:00.910]  hugel and dug around you know and i'm like oh i gotta know all about this this is it this is what
[01:04:00.910 --> 01:04:07.790]  i'm gonna do um but and so i already knew i was gonna be connecting those beds in that one area
[01:04:07.790 --> 01:04:13.870]  well then licensing happened and i found out that that garden that right there where i used to have
[01:04:13.870 --> 01:04:19.310]  all my cannabis um they wouldn't let me grow cannabis there anymore because it was too close
[01:04:19.310 --> 01:04:24.830]  to runoff creek but i could grow commercial food and commercial herbs and have my personal cannabis
[01:04:24.830 --> 01:04:35.550]  there so so i kept it and then i moved my medicine garden where they told me about 100 feet away
[01:04:35.550 --> 01:04:41.630]  and to this area and i was gonna do the same exact thing and just have the beds on top you know
[01:04:41.630 --> 01:04:48.590]  and um start there well after my first year growing i'm like i'm used to having really
[01:04:48.590 --> 01:04:55.230]  large plants like really large like our thing was like when we did our estimates like our
[01:04:56.190 --> 01:05:01.550]  it was around seven pounds per plant was the average and that was like you know maybe some
[01:05:01.550 --> 01:05:06.750]  five we even had 11 pounders we would have like we would always decide which is the biggest plant
[01:05:06.750 --> 01:05:11.870]  and like harvest that separately so we could see you know what it would yield but like we had large
[01:05:11.870 --> 01:05:17.390]  plants well that year i ended up having three pound plants and i was like what the fuck i can't
[01:05:17.390 --> 01:05:24.110]  do this this was like 2017 and um i realized what had happened is my plants were starting to go into
[01:05:24.110 --> 01:05:28.190]  the ground and then they just yellowed out you know when they're about to do that big stretch
[01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:33.390]  they're like yes we're about to go for it my big ones started to do that and then they all yellowed
[01:05:33.390 --> 01:05:38.270]  out and they just stayed there they stunted for the rest of the year and i had to keep doing
[01:05:38.270 --> 01:05:45.630]  these like um eggshell solutions to it and i was giving um eggs like the oyster shells powder
[01:05:46.510 --> 01:05:51.070]  and i was having to do that and i kept it and maintained it well then that year after i had
[01:05:51.070 --> 01:05:57.470]  my soil test and i found out that that it was just all serpentine serpentine rock and serpentine
[01:05:57.470 --> 01:06:04.510]  if y'all don't know it's um it'll actually kill your roots it stunts growth and like there's only
[01:06:04.510 --> 01:06:10.190]  certain plants that can grow in serpentine soils um and then not only that but my soil was
[01:06:10.190 --> 01:06:17.790]  completely devoid of any calcium so i've got this garden now bill and i'm like fuck this is like one
[01:06:17.790 --> 01:06:25.710]  of the worst places possible to build this garden and um that's when i decided to go down so in my
[01:06:26.670 --> 01:06:31.150]  garden last year is when we first did the hugels and what we're calling the goddess garden it's
[01:06:31.150 --> 01:06:36.590]  now the vegetable garden and we can we connected all of those eight by foot beds we took it all
[01:06:36.590 --> 01:06:41.550]  down we connected it with wood and stuff i built up some of the others with some wood underneath
[01:06:41.550 --> 01:06:48.030]  kind of dug and stuck some stuff in there and made these beds and it's going amazing i love it and it
[01:06:48.030 --> 01:06:54.030]  was done more on top of the soil it was just right see i dug down like maybe two inches just to kind
[01:06:54.030 --> 01:07:01.230]  of break stuff up and and then start filling in and um and also i wanted in case the rains kind of
[01:07:01.230 --> 01:07:07.790]  come down there to dip a little bit and so that was that one bull the medicine garden though i
[01:07:07.790 --> 01:07:15.950]  ended up going down and we dug down six foot feet in samaritans and um then we pulled out all this
[01:07:15.950 --> 01:07:23.070]  serpentine rock like fucking boulders of serpentine rock and then what i did is i went on the very
[01:07:23.150 --> 01:07:29.390]  bottoms of all of them and i had oyster shells that we had been able to collect a lot of from
[01:07:30.510 --> 01:07:35.070]  we had a friend that used to work at a restaurant in calistoga and on his way would bring all these
[01:07:35.070 --> 01:07:40.350]  oyster shells we'd have boxes of oyster shells we get delivered sometimes daily at our gate so i
[01:07:40.350 --> 01:07:45.790]  had a bunch of those and we put a ton of those at the bottom and then just oyster shell powder and
[01:07:45.790 --> 01:07:52.670]  gypsum and then on that i kind of covered up where any more serpentine rock was with cardboard
[01:07:52.670 --> 01:07:59.470]  and um we also had to widen our roads and widening the roads we had a lot of trees where
[01:07:59.470 --> 01:08:05.550]  we are and so it was this really beautiful synchronistic thing where i was able to have
[01:08:05.550 --> 01:08:12.110]  these beds deep enough to put in all the dead trees and the stuff that we widened and really made
[01:08:12.110 --> 01:08:18.430]  um made a defensible space around the gardens and stuff with all that and so most of it was
[01:08:18.430 --> 01:08:24.190]  like just dead and so we're able to backfill all those in there with that um all those trees and
[01:08:24.190 --> 01:08:31.150]  stuff around the areas and then i had horses for a couple years and so i had enough manure to
[01:08:31.790 --> 01:08:36.110]  like fill up almost like two feet i couldn't believe it we still have horse manure
[01:08:36.750 --> 01:08:43.870]  and then goat manure and alfalfa i end up bringing in some organic alfalfa and um yeah so those beds
[01:08:43.870 --> 01:08:49.310]  i just have built up and that's going to be the medicine garden for this next year but for me i
[01:08:49.310 --> 01:08:56.350]  and also in the area like i'm in a i'm i'm growing like i did in a desert region i'm so glad i learned
[01:08:56.350 --> 01:09:01.310]  how to grow in a desert region during my wolfing days because this is what my land is now turned
[01:09:01.310 --> 01:09:07.390]  into it's like more mediterranean it's just dry as fuck and like we had hardly any rain this year
[01:09:07.390 --> 01:09:12.590]  so what i'm seeing is the deep hugel cultures they're i'm not allowing them to go up because
[01:09:12.590 --> 01:09:17.870]  i kind of want to go down just a little bit because i want the rain to come down and it's
[01:09:17.870 --> 01:09:25.390]  also i feel like it won't dry out as much during those really fucking hot days and then what i've
[01:09:25.390 --> 01:09:32.190]  also noticed happening is i'm able to sink so much water right now and it's right beside my well
[01:09:32.190 --> 01:09:39.070]  and so i'm i'm like rehydrating that landscape by having this so deep and so i'm kind of curious on
[01:09:39.070 --> 01:09:45.150]  that experiment but this is why those were done so differently compared to like said you really
[01:09:45.150 --> 01:09:50.270]  usually kind of build it right on top of the soil so just kind of put that differentiating
[01:09:50.990 --> 01:09:57.230]  that was beautifully described and so well um explained because yeah there are different needs
[01:09:57.230 --> 01:10:03.070]  or different methods or different uses for these methods and yeah by sinking it in soil that's
[01:10:03.070 --> 01:10:08.510]  been draining beautiful you're actually storing the moisture and by putting it on top of soil
[01:10:08.510 --> 01:10:13.630]  that doesn't drain you're not you're preventing things from going anaerobic and that was a really
[01:10:13.630 --> 01:10:19.310]  interesting talk on the serpentine because yes serpentine is a metamorphic stone and it tends
[01:10:19.310 --> 01:10:26.190]  to have qualities of high nutrition that can cause lockout and the calcium cells love you girl that
[01:10:26.190 --> 01:10:32.110]  was fucking beautiful because we need more calcium in our soils for sure so that was a great nugget
[01:10:32.110 --> 01:10:37.470]  there when you mentioned the manures i you know if you have a little piece of land you know raising
[01:10:37.470 --> 01:10:42.270]  all those different animals which one do you think gives the best roi for taking the time to
[01:10:42.270 --> 01:10:51.230]  care for those animals um i think it's again on the depends on the environment so for us we've
[01:10:51.230 --> 01:10:56.990]  really been asking ourselves like are we sustainable are we really regenerative and i had horses just
[01:10:56.990 --> 01:11:01.870]  because i love horses it's an horse caravan i'm like obsessed with horses but like i have two
[01:11:01.870 --> 01:11:07.070]  farms and so the farm that they used to be is more rolling hills and there's a lot of grass
[01:11:07.070 --> 01:11:11.550]  well i had to bring them all over i end up consolidating after licensing you know she just
[01:11:11.550 --> 01:11:17.470]  hit the fan i couldn't do two farms anymore and so i subleased that out but i brought my animals over
[01:11:17.470 --> 01:11:23.950]  and so my horses they don't have any grass they we've been like having to you know find organic
[01:11:23.950 --> 01:11:28.830]  stuff as much as possible and just like give them their diet but for us we realized they weren't
[01:11:28.830 --> 01:11:35.310]  sustainable so just this year we um we had to give our horses away and we also do the same thing with
[01:11:35.310 --> 01:11:40.910]  the goats we realized the goats they were just um it just wasn't working out wasn't sustainable we
[01:11:40.910 --> 01:11:45.710]  were still feeding them they weren't eating as much brush as we thought they would they'd sleep
[01:11:45.710 --> 01:11:52.270]  on my porch they got into how many cannabis gardens and ate all the plants you know so but i mean both
[01:11:52.270 --> 01:11:56.830]  of those produced a lot of poop like i had that's what those gardens are filled with because we had
[01:11:56.830 --> 01:12:01.230]  animals for years and like i never collected the horse manure because i knew i was going to do
[01:12:01.230 --> 01:12:08.430]  something really epic with it so it was there's so much of it um and so that was a lot of poop
[01:12:08.430 --> 01:12:17.390]  and but now for us what i've realized is i've gone now to bunnies and chickens because my god i had
[01:12:17.390 --> 01:12:22.190]  this we were given two rabbits from our first wolfer i did i'll do a wolfing program at our
[01:12:22.190 --> 01:12:27.550]  place which i absolutely love and um she found out i was like i was in this thing i was like i'm gonna
[01:12:27.550 --> 01:12:32.590]  get bunnies now and i'm gonna have bunnies at each garden so i don't have to go and like run and
[01:12:32.590 --> 01:12:36.510]  collect it from a certain area because we have three gardens now on the property we have what
[01:12:36.510 --> 01:12:43.310]  the medicine garden is we have the goddess garden and i have a big greenhouse and so it's a it's a
[01:12:43.310 --> 01:12:49.230]  big property so i'm constantly going to the animal place getting my manures for my teas or getting
[01:12:49.230 --> 01:12:55.470]  you know for top dressing or whatever and i'm just i'm over it but bunnies oh my god those two bunnies
[01:12:55.550 --> 01:13:01.790]  took care of my whole greenhouse and i i was so impressed with how much poop that they create
[01:13:02.350 --> 01:13:09.790]  that i was like wow and so that's like our new thing and for us too we have to look at like
[01:13:11.390 --> 01:13:16.990]  that we evacuate almost every year down here in lake county with the fires and so to evacuate
[01:13:16.990 --> 01:13:22.110]  with horses and goats it was fucking a nightmare it was a nightmare you know because the horses and
[01:13:22.110 --> 01:13:26.430]  the goats they definitely feel like when stuff's going on so they don't want to go on those
[01:13:26.430 --> 01:13:31.630]  trailers and it's always this big cluster whereas the bunnies and the chickens we just put them in
[01:13:31.630 --> 01:13:37.870]  bins and took off and so that was another reasoning for us for our animals of like what animal
[01:13:37.870 --> 01:13:43.310]  produces will be good enough you know enough poop for us but also is sustainable in our land that we
[01:13:43.310 --> 01:13:49.550]  can feed most of it from and that's when ours was bunnies chickens and we'll probably get a couple
[01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:55.790]  ducks um so yeah i think it's every different farm and what the environment is and what you have
[01:13:55.790 --> 01:14:01.230]  space for and if those animals will also thrive because you want your animals to thrive too so
[01:14:01.230 --> 01:14:06.910]  they have good poop and you just see you want a big good synergistic you know farm holistic farm
[01:14:06.910 --> 01:14:14.350]  happening now you've raised alpacas no no i haven't raised alpacas horses goats chickens
[01:14:14.990 --> 01:14:21.390]  and bunnies that's been and you know a wide range of other animals i've picked up a long way but
[01:14:21.390 --> 01:14:29.390]  those mainly yeah no for the you have any do you have pests snail pests in your farm
[01:14:30.750 --> 01:14:36.910]  because ducks are great to to solve slugs snails anything like that they just look you know they
[01:14:36.910 --> 01:14:43.710]  eat pure protein and yeah that poop is crazy crazy hot like that's awesome okay cool i i
[01:14:43.710 --> 01:14:47.310]  definitely want that's one reason i wanted to get ducks and so they could go around and maybe
[01:14:47.310 --> 01:14:58.270]  eat some of those uh roly-polies no no we use a mine are totally different we have a i have a
[01:14:58.270 --> 01:15:04.670]  just like designer isopods so they're so pretty i checked out your site i was like oh my god i
[01:15:04.670 --> 01:15:08.590]  didn't even realize i would they would replicate as quick as the ones you're talking about the
[01:15:08.590 --> 01:15:16.190]  little gray ones i i'd be a you know life would be super super well but no um the kubara species
[01:15:16.190 --> 01:15:22.590]  that's what this is uh was just discovered in thailand in 2017 so it's a brand new roly-poly
[01:15:22.590 --> 01:15:29.150]  it's it's really nothing to do with the ones that when we farm uh cannabis uh if if you let
[01:15:29.150 --> 01:15:33.550]  them get out of control we'll obviously start to take things down but i personally like even
[01:15:34.510 --> 01:15:38.590]  using some of these they're called dairy cows they like protein more than than other things
[01:15:38.590 --> 01:15:44.270]  but using that to break down in the worm bins i've really seen that those are beneficial
[01:15:44.270 --> 01:15:49.550]  isopods so i feel like you know there's there's over 100 different just kubara species alone
[01:15:50.190 --> 01:15:55.150]  so i feel like the the world of isopods has just started so it's definitely something that uh
[01:15:56.110 --> 01:15:59.390]  i hope more and more people start to research and understand it's because they are
[01:15:59.950 --> 01:16:03.710]  organic matter decomposers and when they're used in the right way
[01:16:04.670 --> 01:16:12.190]  yeah it really better be beneficial especially for worm farming and just quickly i'm randomly
[01:16:12.190 --> 01:16:18.190]  i'm i'm always like two minutes behind you so like you'll talk about your eight by eight raised beds
[01:16:18.190 --> 01:16:23.550]  and that's why like two minutes later you'll see me post them so you're always on to the next topic
[01:16:23.550 --> 01:16:28.270]  but anyway i just want to quickly show some of your so this is the eight by eights right kind of
[01:16:28.270 --> 01:16:33.470]  in general the concept uh-huh yeah this is bio chart you're making your bio chart but that's the
[01:16:34.590 --> 01:16:41.550]  and and then you had mentioned um what the uh it's beautiful land by the way
[01:16:43.390 --> 01:16:51.390]  so that's what this one is so this was an old mine yes i actually have an old mine at my place
[01:16:51.390 --> 01:16:58.590]  but like on my property it's definitely been mine for other things too like i have an old
[01:16:58.590 --> 01:17:04.190]  mercury mine but before that um i believe they said that there was gold and then there was and
[01:17:04.190 --> 01:17:10.270]  it was piped like we have a big pipe that types into one of the springs that goes naturally and
[01:17:10.270 --> 01:17:16.030]  it would pipe down to the gold mine on the other property below me and um but then there's also
[01:17:16.030 --> 01:17:19.950]  like place where they mine down to the bedrock and that that one picture you just showed that
[01:17:19.950 --> 01:17:26.270]  was just like the sliding landscape and that's just bedrock and so right there and so i've been
[01:17:26.270 --> 01:17:30.590]  working i talked to this environmental scientist that kind of came out and just do permaculture
[01:17:30.590 --> 01:17:35.470]  techniques and trying to figure out you know like how do i rebuild this and like one it's a really
[01:17:35.470 --> 01:17:41.150]  high hike up there you know i could do all kinds of stuff but it's hard to get to and so one of the
[01:17:41.150 --> 01:17:45.870]  biggest things is right here is you're just digging your foot into the ground getting some native
[01:17:45.870 --> 01:17:49.950]  seeds spreading around so if you find any more native grasses kind of make a little compost with
[01:17:49.950 --> 01:17:55.230]  what's around and me and the kids just do that in the winter we walk up there and like i said it's
[01:17:55.230 --> 01:17:59.710]  pretty you know it's a nice hike up there it's not like you could just carry a big old thing of
[01:17:59.710 --> 01:18:04.830]  straw or something on your back or anything up there and so um we've just been doing that for
[01:18:04.830 --> 01:18:10.190]  the last few years and trying to you know bring nature back and let her do her thing the goat
[01:18:10.670 --> 01:18:16.270]  yeah and the the land yeah and it's like got other places too that i haven't even made it to that i
[01:18:16.270 --> 01:18:22.830]  can see when i'm sitting up at the one part of a hill is that where you can see where dynamite
[01:18:22.830 --> 01:18:27.150]  they were trying to check for pockets and so there's just like been explosions on the land
[01:18:27.150 --> 01:18:32.430]  so this land is like super mineral rich it's got a lot of very different types of really cool
[01:18:32.430 --> 01:18:36.190]  minerals on it it's really fun that's another reason i really loved it there was crystals
[01:18:36.350 --> 01:18:41.950]  were they quartz crystals or were they other types yeah different quartz crystals and then
[01:18:41.950 --> 01:18:47.390]  it's kind of cool you can see where um lava has floated over some and so they're like kind of
[01:18:47.390 --> 01:18:52.430]  work together and they're bubbly and so that's really fun and there's some obsidian we found
[01:18:52.430 --> 01:18:59.070]  some um arrowheads close to the creek and so that's kind of cool and then there's some
[01:18:59.310 --> 01:19:04.990]  and so that's really fun and there's some obsidian we found some um arrowheads close to the creek
[01:19:05.710 --> 01:19:12.190]  and yeah it's a cool region it's different it's very rocky in some ways and then on the other
[01:19:12.190 --> 01:19:16.670]  side you've got like moss growing up trees so you have two almost different environments on this
[01:19:16.670 --> 01:19:23.390]  place on this property that for me i keep thinking like um i will eventually do grow some reishi on
[01:19:23.390 --> 01:19:27.230]  the side of the mountain maybe that's where i grow some of my ginseng you know some of these
[01:19:27.230 --> 01:19:33.550]  more at-risk herbs that need the forest and some of the mushrooms so it's pretty fun i love it
[01:19:34.830 --> 01:19:40.750]  yeah it sounds like you got a really badass place up there it's just yeah i mean that's no and having
[01:19:40.750 --> 01:19:45.390]  the two different environments that's not something that most people get the opportunity to have on
[01:19:45.390 --> 01:19:49.710]  their property you know usually you're either you're in a valley or you're on a mountainside
[01:19:49.710 --> 01:19:54.430]  but you're not getting both those extremes of you know because the water's all dumping on the other
[01:19:54.430 --> 01:19:59.710]  side of that mountain creating that mosses on the other side it's dry and barren yeah
[01:20:01.470 --> 01:20:05.310]  and you're doing all the right things with how to how to deal with that and i love the fact that
[01:20:05.310 --> 01:20:10.110]  you're planting native plants and trying to re-establish the vegetation which will then in
[01:20:10.110 --> 01:20:16.110]  turn bring in more mother nature's components so beautiful work sweetie beautiful work thank you
[01:20:16.110 --> 01:20:22.590]  yeah thank you yeah for i was gonna say you've got quite a fucking life story there
[01:20:25.950 --> 01:20:30.190]  yeah i definitely feel like i get a little confused because i feel like i've lived at least
[01:20:30.190 --> 01:20:37.070]  this is like my fourth lifetime already out here and on this planet and there's been a lot of i've
[01:20:37.070 --> 01:20:43.710]  changed who i am like several times this existence but now i'm seeing and my 40 is how all of that
[01:20:43.710 --> 01:20:50.990]  really is all merged and become part of who i am and why it all feeds into each other whereas it
[01:20:50.990 --> 01:20:55.870]  was like my healer friends were like why are you farming now we're so confused but for me it was
[01:20:55.870 --> 01:21:00.350]  like this mixture of like of course i'm farming of course i'm learning how to grow my own food
[01:21:00.350 --> 01:21:06.670]  and herbs because i want my help i want my help for my kids and so it's just been like this really
[01:21:06.670 --> 01:21:12.590]  um yeah it's been quite a ride well you know i'll be honest with you uh you know i talked to my
[01:21:12.590 --> 01:21:19.390]  children about this and and others you are a sum total of all your experiences so every experience
[01:21:19.390 --> 01:21:24.750]  that you do whether it's nursing whether it's working in a mailroom working as a clerk it
[01:21:24.750 --> 01:21:29.550]  doesn't matter they all build into themselves eventually and you come to find out that those
[01:21:29.550 --> 01:21:34.350]  experiences that you thought were worthless actually become valuable at some point in your
[01:21:34.350 --> 01:21:39.230]  life to help you transition into another part of it so it's you know that's why i said something
[01:21:39.230 --> 01:21:46.030]  because that's just you know an example of how cool diversity can help a person and so instead
[01:21:46.030 --> 01:21:52.590]  of like getting locked into one thing expand explore try other things try different jobs try
[01:21:52.590 --> 01:21:58.190]  different plants um you know and that's i think that's the real lesson you know for today is that
[01:21:58.190 --> 01:22:03.550]  you know again you are a subtotal of your experiences so the more experiences that you have
[01:22:03.630 --> 01:22:08.670]  the better off you are and more prepared you are for this crazy fucked up world
[01:22:08.670 --> 01:22:17.150]  2000 you know for sure for sure i also feel like legalization was hard like it was fucking
[01:22:17.150 --> 01:22:24.510]  hard transition for us and um like we i was ready to go and like we lost it all we had you know we
[01:22:24.510 --> 01:22:31.790]  had a lot of theft that year and um the person you know people got raided and all kinds of shit but
[01:22:31.790 --> 01:22:37.710]  we lost it all and so we were ready to go on to licensing i was at a point where i was like fuck
[01:22:37.710 --> 01:22:44.110]  i have no money none i put all my eggs in one basket going okay here we go let's do this and
[01:22:44.110 --> 01:22:49.950]  it just went got wiped off the table and i had to let my teams go had two teams at two different
[01:22:49.950 --> 01:22:56.590]  farms we had to let them go and it was like me and my manager who is now like um a co-owner in
[01:22:56.590 --> 01:23:01.550]  the business she's like stuck with me through it all and i realized i was like fuck what we gonna
[01:23:01.550 --> 01:23:06.750]  do okay i'm gonna have to consolidate i'm gonna have to grow this herb i've had gardeners you know
[01:23:06.750 --> 01:23:12.670]  and i was overseeing things i was making products i was kind of being mom i had just had a kid and so
[01:23:13.710 --> 01:23:19.710]  i had to step really back into that role which was what i've realized has been one of the best
[01:23:19.710 --> 01:23:24.670]  things that's really happened for me because it's i mean legalization and i like almost losing
[01:23:24.670 --> 01:23:31.070]  everything because it really made me get clear on what my priorities were and me made me re-remember
[01:23:31.070 --> 01:23:37.470]  like who i am like i got so caught up in just growing cannabis and farming for so long that i
[01:23:37.470 --> 01:23:43.630]  forgot there's this whole other aspect of healer to me and like plant talker and you know just
[01:23:43.630 --> 01:23:51.710]  energy worker and i re-remembered that part of me during a lot of this and then i started realizing
[01:23:51.710 --> 01:23:59.230]  that my interest i'm very dedicated to cannabis i feel like i'm one of her she's my most powerful
[01:23:59.230 --> 01:24:03.870]  ally but i've realized that the other plants were starting to talk with me as well and that i'm
[01:24:03.870 --> 01:24:09.710]  really interested in that and i'm interested in sharing with people what i know and what i've
[01:24:09.710 --> 01:24:16.670]  picked up and what i've learned and so it's become this transition where now as i'm going i'm still
[01:24:16.670 --> 01:24:21.710]  working on our license like i have i've got all our study you know all i have to do now is turn
[01:24:21.710 --> 01:24:28.430]  in our application after we get some more funds for that but it's like i'm not taking it as fast
[01:24:28.430 --> 01:24:33.470]  as i thought i had to make everything happen because now our medicine garden is getting turned
[01:24:33.470 --> 01:24:38.750]  into a commercial herb garden as well so the beds i did not only they're six feet down they're like
[01:24:38.750 --> 01:24:43.710]  12 feet across and then i kind of closed it in to now where it's eight feet but there's still
[01:24:43.710 --> 01:24:50.830]  growing room underneath because i want to grow a lot of herbs and like the moringa the name the
[01:24:50.830 --> 01:24:55.390]  name is another one that can grow in my climate into bushy but i want the new leaves so it's
[01:24:55.390 --> 01:24:59.550]  perfect so i'm looking at different plants that are actually going to bring in a profit
[01:24:59.550 --> 01:25:04.590]  that are also like really medicinal the ones i want to use in my products the ones that
[01:25:04.590 --> 01:25:10.750]  cancer patients definitely need you know the ones that are really needed and so that's why i've
[01:25:10.750 --> 01:25:16.270]  expanded that garden and during this transition i'm not sure if i was just getting caught up in
[01:25:16.270 --> 01:25:22.430]  legalization if i would have gone as full force as what i am doing now and so i'd have to give thanks
[01:25:23.070 --> 01:25:29.310]  for you know everything falling apart so we could come back together and i'm really happy like i
[01:25:29.310 --> 01:25:36.270]  took all my gardens down and redid them and now we have like at least five times as much space to grow
[01:25:36.990 --> 01:25:41.390]  and they're going to be way healthier plants there's going to be more water conservation
[01:25:42.110 --> 01:25:47.550]  and so yeah i just kind of have to give thanks for those like crazy parts in our journey that we're
[01:25:47.550 --> 01:25:55.710]  like but you know really makes us who we are and helps us like re-remember that and so on the land
[01:25:55.710 --> 01:26:01.230]  too not only the reason we have three gardens the reason i didn't move just the cannabis garden over
[01:26:01.230 --> 01:26:07.470]  i knew at that point i was like the goddess garden is now being transitioned into our education
[01:26:07.470 --> 01:26:12.030]  demonstration permaculture garden where it's like we've held our first workshop out there
[01:26:12.030 --> 01:26:16.190]  i hold workshops constantly for little ones for the wolfers you know to show them how to do
[01:26:16.190 --> 01:26:20.510]  everything and because we're teaching at the same time that we're doing this work trade that's the
[01:26:20.510 --> 01:26:28.270]  thing about wolfing is that we provide um like shelter camping a kitchen some foods and education
[01:26:28.270 --> 01:26:34.350]  in exchange for their work and so i love this dynamic and so that's becoming this teaching
[01:26:34.350 --> 01:26:40.430]  gardens and i left the aisles really wide so i could have like a classroom in the middle of these
[01:26:40.430 --> 01:26:46.510]  aisles and um so that that garden's really transitioning right now and then on to the
[01:26:46.510 --> 01:26:52.990]  medicine one this next year and i'm just really excited for that and beautiful i'm just happy for
[01:26:52.990 --> 01:26:57.790]  the transition as well and where we're going the universe hard at work right
[01:26:57.790 --> 01:27:10.190]  right always brings something good out of it yeah for sure hey josh edel edeldington i'm sorry if i
[01:27:10.190 --> 01:27:16.670]  butchered your name uh why don't you follow uh pauline on instagram pauline coinis um because
[01:27:16.670 --> 01:27:24.190]  thank you that's a wonderful gift my friend appreciate it um so where is uh where are you
[01:27:24.190 --> 01:27:30.590]  in legalization you have to go ahead and file your final permit and and then you're done because
[01:27:30.590 --> 01:27:36.590]  i yeah i've seen so many people go through this hell of regulatory where as soon as they get
[01:27:36.590 --> 01:27:40.910]  through this hoop then they're like oh well now you need to have an indian study or now you need
[01:27:40.910 --> 01:27:48.110]  to have a water study and it's like an endless chain of bullshit regulatory nonsense where they're
[01:27:48.110 --> 01:27:53.950]  just milking these poor farmers out of the money have you been through all that shit now oh yeah
[01:27:54.270 --> 01:27:58.990]  that's why it's taken so long and one of the reasons too is because i was determined to fund
[01:27:58.990 --> 01:28:04.430]  this myself without bringing in investors i got one loan from a friend and then he couldn't really
[01:28:04.430 --> 01:28:09.870]  do it so i was like i've just been funding each thing at a time like we had our archaeological
[01:28:09.870 --> 01:28:15.790]  study we've got their water board i've had since 2016 like i was ready to go and then we had um
[01:28:15.790 --> 01:28:21.710]  the fishing game it just got done i had to redo that fucking permit this was like the fourth time
[01:28:21.710 --> 01:28:25.950]  because they kept switching they're like oh i had to turn it in i mailed it in they're like oh it's
[01:28:25.950 --> 01:28:30.190]  online now i did the online they're like oh this is the wrong one i had to do it over and fucking
[01:28:30.190 --> 01:28:35.870]  over and so that's finally done i've had the biological study you know and that was like what
[01:28:35.870 --> 01:28:44.430]  3500 it's like all these things were so fucking much and um so now and the site plan everything
[01:28:44.430 --> 01:28:48.350]  and now we've kind of changed the garden so i that's the last thing i really need to do is
[01:28:48.350 --> 01:28:55.310]  three finish up um the site plan because we're also able to do manufacturing out that's one cool
[01:28:55.310 --> 01:29:01.550]  thing about lake county is they're allowing level one the non-volatile manufacturing on rural land
[01:29:01.550 --> 01:29:07.710]  as long as you are your roads are commercial standards and so that was a big thing i had to
[01:29:07.710 --> 01:29:14.670]  do this spring was get my roads 20 feet across um and that i have a couple more things i'll have to
[01:29:14.670 --> 01:29:20.430]  do with that but that was a huge expense so now i'm at a point where yeah it's like now i have to
[01:29:20.430 --> 01:29:26.030]  come up with another i think it's about seven grand for my permit and um because i'm doing
[01:29:26.030 --> 01:29:30.990]  self-distribution we're doing level one manufacturing and we're doing a 10 000 square foot garden
[01:29:31.630 --> 01:29:38.270]  and a cottage greenhouse and so there's a lot on just that one property and i have to have it all
[01:29:38.270 --> 01:29:44.190]  kind of done so but that's where we're at and then as i was ready to kind of like okay i've got the
[01:29:44.190 --> 01:29:50.430]  money together i've collected it we are well caught on fire this year like literally went up
[01:29:50.430 --> 01:29:58.350]  in flames i we had our electric redone so that it would not be sketchy looking going towards the well
[01:29:58.350 --> 01:30:02.750]  and i was like oh great now i'm going to feel real confident we didn't even use our well this year
[01:30:02.750 --> 01:30:08.910]  um because i have two 50 000 gallon bladders i have a hundred thousand gallons of water that i
[01:30:08.910 --> 01:30:14.750]  store in the winter to use all year and so luckily i had those and our well wasn't in use but we got
[01:30:14.750 --> 01:30:19.630]  it hooked up and the same day it was hooked up luckily i was in the garden because it caught
[01:30:19.630 --> 01:30:28.590]  fire and so we didn't have a well for months and we just actually got that redone refixed
[01:30:28.590 --> 01:30:34.910]  and now it's super legit and it's running really well um but that went all my permit money
[01:30:35.870 --> 01:30:42.350]  so it's like you know it's those kind of things keep happening so that's where i'm at i'm just like
[01:30:42.350 --> 01:30:47.150]  i'm one step at a time you know i'm doing it and now i'm not in a rush because i'm like i'm
[01:30:47.150 --> 01:30:54.350]  growing herbs i can have an osu that i have enough stuff that is like providing us you know
[01:30:55.870 --> 01:31:00.270]  i like what i've learned to do because i heard this from a permaculture teacher before is like
[01:31:00.270 --> 01:31:06.430]  have seven different every farm should have seven different forms of income and so for me i've been
[01:31:06.430 --> 01:31:12.350]  working this last couple years to not rely on just the cannabis as i've had for our overhead and so
[01:31:12.350 --> 01:31:17.230]  that's been slowly building up with the products that i make and it's all been word of mouth because
[01:31:17.230 --> 01:31:22.430]  we've still been working on the website and all that jazz but um that's now at a place where it's
[01:31:22.430 --> 01:31:27.630]  supporting us and so i feel good about going into like the commercial herb garden hopefully next
[01:31:27.710 --> 01:31:33.950]  year we'll have our license but if not we'll probably do hemp and cbg because i want to do that
[01:31:34.670 --> 01:31:42.990]  um and along with the other herbs so yeah and then the i mean the eventual plan is to get my
[01:31:42.990 --> 01:31:50.590]  other property ready to go for hemp and um cbd flower and the cbg and some other things i want
[01:31:50.590 --> 01:31:55.470]  to play with there but that farm i'm i've been i've been holding on to it because i know what i
[01:31:55.470 --> 01:32:00.350]  want to do there it's rolling hills i think it'll be a good environment i had the people there put
[01:32:00.350 --> 01:32:07.230]  in fuels the way i designed and um getting it all prepared for that and then this farm where i'm at
[01:32:07.230 --> 01:32:13.630]  be able to have the 10 000 square foot cannabis grown within the commercial herb garden and we'll
[01:32:13.630 --> 01:32:18.750]  have the cottage greenhouse it's mainly going to be our one-to-ones and different stuff that i use
[01:32:18.750 --> 01:32:23.950]  for products that i need more consistently and then we'll have our manufacturing and be able to do
[01:32:24.590 --> 01:32:32.350]  tinctures and solves and i do a lot of face care products and rso we do a lot of rso the ethanol
[01:32:32.350 --> 01:32:38.190]  extraction and we do a really good job on it i feel and um i'm really passionate about that
[01:32:38.190 --> 01:32:44.270]  medicine so that's another like the one we're going to be doing yeah rso man if you if you
[01:32:44.270 --> 01:32:52.030]  have to buy it at a dispensary it is ridiculous you can't nobody can afford to do it and so it's
[01:32:52.030 --> 01:32:56.910]  i'm so glad that you're going to be you know making more of it um it's been a lifesaver for
[01:32:56.910 --> 01:33:03.150]  pauline and you know i've been blessed that um the people that we get it from are both regenerative
[01:33:03.150 --> 01:33:08.190]  organic um but they're not raping us they're charging us you know a few dollars a gram which
[01:33:08.190 --> 01:33:14.270]  is more than affordable um and then it also allows her to help her friends and and you know clients
[01:33:14.270 --> 01:33:20.350]  by making it extremely affordable to them instead of this you know 80 a gram or some bullshit that
[01:33:20.430 --> 01:33:26.590]  the dispensary's charge keep up the good work girl you're just fucking killing it on all sides
[01:33:26.590 --> 01:33:32.190]  which is beautiful and you know what a great representation of hard work and dedication and
[01:33:32.190 --> 01:33:37.470]  not getting pissed off and frustrated not being entitled you know taking the punches man going
[01:33:37.470 --> 01:33:44.270]  with the liquor big ups to you man big ups yeah yeah it's been uh i definitely realized i had a
[01:33:44.270 --> 01:33:49.950]  little bit of an ego after you know during the cannabis time and that's been kind of fun to get
[01:33:49.950 --> 01:33:54.830]  rid of you know because i was the little girl in lake county who grew 10 pound plants and i was
[01:33:54.830 --> 01:34:00.110]  kind of known for that in my circles and then like everyone knew i was gonna be one of the first
[01:34:00.110 --> 01:34:05.870]  people to get my license and it didn't happen and like every shit all the shit fell apart and
[01:34:05.870 --> 01:34:11.310]  then my plants were little and like it just it was beautiful though you know you have that crash
[01:34:11.950 --> 01:34:17.630]  and you're like wait who am i again what am i doing why am i on this planet
[01:34:18.590 --> 01:34:24.670]  so yeah it's beautiful i'm into that man i'm into that i wouldn't i would never be on the
[01:34:24.670 --> 01:34:29.870]  journey i'm on if it wasn't for a horrible divorce and losing everything i mean literally everything
[01:34:31.150 --> 01:34:35.790]  but that's that's what it takes but you've got to be the person to stand up and deal with it
[01:34:35.790 --> 01:34:40.350]  not curl up in a ball and say woe is me which you see too many of those people nowadays
[01:34:41.150 --> 01:34:44.830]  so you know it's the it's the lessons it's the life lessons that really
[01:34:45.630 --> 01:34:52.030]  galvanize you uh into what you become later on in life so you know good again beautifully said
[01:34:56.430 --> 01:35:00.910]  passing on those hugel cultures eventually to your children like if you just kind of
[01:35:00.910 --> 01:35:06.190]  maintain that is that something you know that they're going to be able to to run with in their
[01:35:06.190 --> 01:35:13.390]  life or is they're going to have to rebuild that you know 20 years from now the way that i farm and
[01:35:13.390 --> 01:35:18.350]  i think most people do with the hugel cultures is like every year you're adding more like because
[01:35:19.710 --> 01:35:23.630]  i i know that they'll even be better in that generation as long as everything's kept as it
[01:35:23.630 --> 01:35:29.310]  is i do tons of cover crops i go by this philosophy i heard it's like mama don't like to be naked
[01:35:29.310 --> 01:35:34.430]  and so right now my gardens aren't there because my cover crops didn't take this early spring
[01:35:34.430 --> 01:35:40.350]  because we had no rain but usually there is not a single place on my soil that is like
[01:35:40.910 --> 01:35:45.870]  open and so i love chopping and dropping i do four major chop and drops every year and that really
[01:35:45.870 --> 01:35:51.150]  you know that builds it up it keeps building up you're always having that and then i love doing
[01:35:51.150 --> 01:35:55.470]  the top dressings with the bunny manure and so i top dress with that and that just keeps building
[01:35:55.470 --> 01:36:01.710]  soil and then before we go into a big year i have a compost pile you know we're adding to that
[01:36:01.710 --> 01:36:07.790]  i love i'm starting to do the imo3 this next year and adding that on and so it's just that's
[01:36:07.790 --> 01:36:12.270]  like you have your certain things that you just keep up with and so it just keeps rebuilding that
[01:36:12.270 --> 01:36:16.750]  it's not like you ever it's it's not like it's there and that's it you know it's like it's a
[01:36:16.750 --> 01:36:21.230]  continuous thing like nature you know how her leaves just fall continuously and it's just like
[01:36:21.230 --> 01:36:27.630]  this cycle of building and plants coming up and dying and so that's the cycle of it and so the
[01:36:27.630 --> 01:36:32.830]  intention is for it just to get better and better and then i left some of the oyster shells really
[01:36:32.830 --> 01:36:39.710]  whole like some of them we like we like pounded down and i also got the powder but i left a lot
[01:36:39.710 --> 01:36:45.470]  of them whole because i know it's gonna be like five generations you know down the road maybe
[01:36:45.470 --> 01:36:51.790]  that's seven generation that i'm for my family that that's actually gonna break down and so
[01:36:51.790 --> 01:36:57.070]  that calcium is gonna be there and so i've thought about that as we're building this and i am wanting
[01:36:57.070 --> 01:37:01.310]  to leave a legacy for my children like they want to be part of this great or at least like you know
[01:37:01.310 --> 01:37:07.070]  they'll have income from it or i feel like my youngest is gonna be um the one that comes up
[01:37:07.070 --> 01:37:13.390]  and kind of takes this over from me so but yeah that's the that's the goal i mean beautiful
[01:37:13.390 --> 01:37:20.590]  sustainable land and homestead that you know we can raise our families on and that's about freedom
[01:37:20.590 --> 01:37:24.830]  and sovereignty and you know being out of the babylon system
[01:37:27.150 --> 01:37:30.190]  yeah we could go down a lot of those roads
[01:37:32.670 --> 01:37:38.430]  and brian just to just to you know pound that home is that yeah what she's doing will last
[01:37:38.430 --> 01:37:44.110]  generations um you know that's why sometimes it's best to look at the tree species that you're that
[01:37:44.110 --> 01:37:49.150]  you're using and you go hugel cultures a really good hardwood's going to last a lot longer than
[01:37:49.150 --> 01:37:54.430]  the softwood but that's not to say that you can't continuously add to it like mother nature does
[01:37:55.150 --> 01:38:01.950]  so you know again there's no one right way uh to build these you have to use common sense
[01:38:01.950 --> 01:38:06.270]  and understand what you're building on and what is your goals what are you trying to achieve
[01:38:06.830 --> 01:38:11.870]  but um yeah i'm glad that that hegel keeps coming up because you know a lot of people just don't
[01:38:11.870 --> 01:38:17.390]  understand or they've heard one way and there's so many different ways yeah or it's all about
[01:38:17.390 --> 01:38:22.590]  building soil that's the goal i feel like a lot of people maybe try to do this with not the full
[01:38:22.590 --> 01:38:27.390]  a to z understanding and then they just kind of to be honest kind of shit on it like they're like
[01:38:27.390 --> 01:38:33.870]  oh it doesn't really work the same way trying to get yields um but i appreciate you you know taking
[01:38:33.870 --> 01:38:40.110]  the time to to break all of this down because i feel like if you're a real organic living soil
[01:38:40.110 --> 01:38:45.310]  type farmer how are you not farming for the future and hopefully teaching your children i mean that's
[01:38:45.870 --> 01:38:52.350]  i feel like that is um at least for my family the american dream to be able to have a piece of land
[01:38:52.350 --> 01:38:58.110]  like you do outside of the the norm and the hoa and all the things i had mentioned where you can
[01:38:58.110 --> 01:39:02.750]  decide what you want to do with your property and you can continue to improve it year after year
[01:39:03.310 --> 01:39:07.950]  which i feel like is just something that that's your little slice of heaven that you you got up
[01:39:07.950 --> 01:39:12.990]  there and um you know a lot of us are are continuing to hopefully uh achieve that as well
[01:39:13.790 --> 01:39:17.950]  so again just shout out to the piece of property is gorgeous obviously and the fact that you're
[01:39:17.950 --> 01:39:22.990]  able to continue to improve it it's just going to be you know when you see your little kids running
[01:39:22.990 --> 01:39:27.710]  around i feel like that's got to be like the most fulfilling thing in life is just to be like all
[01:39:27.710 --> 01:39:33.790]  right things are improving for our family and that's really all that matters yeah for sure i
[01:39:33.790 --> 01:39:38.190]  think one of my favorite things is to have my little one out there harvesting herbs with me
[01:39:38.190 --> 01:39:43.150]  and her identifying them and like me going what is that one go get me some rosemary go get me that
[01:39:43.150 --> 01:39:49.390]  mother war and her knowing at like now she's seven of what that is and that right there makes me cry
[01:39:49.390 --> 01:39:54.910]  i'm like yes do it you know because i was raised in babylon i didn't know any of this shit and so
[01:39:54.910 --> 01:40:01.310]  it's just really fun to be able to pass that on and even my son who was raised in rainbow gatherings
[01:40:01.310 --> 01:40:07.630]  and horse caravans and now he's like electronics kind of person he still knows about health and he
[01:40:07.630 --> 01:40:12.990]  still knows how to compost and all this other stuff that he will not ever admit to but he knows
[01:40:12.990 --> 01:40:20.750]  how to do it and so i love that that's great well yeah remember they're gonna teach other people too
[01:40:20.750 --> 01:40:26.910]  and and your son is gonna run into a situation where he needs it and he's gonna go oh man
[01:40:27.790 --> 01:40:34.350]  i really owe mom a big hug and thanks for this that's what happened my my favorite was like he
[01:40:34.350 --> 01:40:37.710]  was always telling me he's like i don't need to learn how to grow food there's grocery stores i'm
[01:40:37.710 --> 01:40:42.110]  like well what if there are no grocery stores exactly you know and he'd be like whatever mom
[01:40:42.110 --> 01:40:48.910]  whatever and then our grocery store burnt down like it literally burned down in middletown and
[01:40:48.910 --> 01:40:55.470]  i was like see and he was like oh my god and like it took us so far because like we're in middletown
[01:40:55.470 --> 01:41:01.230]  so it takes us about an hour to go to another grocery store and so we had we started growing
[01:41:01.230 --> 01:41:05.550]  a lot more food and he was like well i want some corn i want some maybe some beans you know
[01:41:06.910 --> 01:41:10.670]  that was a really fun and like you know kind of thing that happened not that that was fun
[01:41:10.670 --> 01:41:20.110]  that that happened but it was like life lesson for sure i was like i told you what if there are
[01:41:20.110 --> 01:41:24.510]  no grocery stores what if there is not you know what if there's no gas and that's why for a while
[01:41:24.510 --> 01:41:29.950]  i was like that's why we got horses so we could go to town if we need to but you know we can maybe
[01:41:30.030 --> 01:41:37.390]  ride our bikes so it'll be fine yeah to be honest i don't know how deep but i feel like if there's no
[01:41:37.390 --> 01:41:42.030]  gas and their stuff there's such chaos that you probably wouldn't ride your horse through that
[01:41:42.030 --> 01:41:48.110]  anyway no i mean that's the reality is i think that a lot of shit would be going off for weeks
[01:41:48.110 --> 01:41:55.790]  until probably settled down but uh yeah that's um i feel like again why we want to we got to do
[01:41:55.790 --> 01:42:01.070]  things and improve our life the way that we take hold and i feel like understanding how to grow
[01:42:01.070 --> 01:42:06.510]  food is definitely a skill set uh that's going to be in high demand i feel like for our children and
[01:42:06.510 --> 01:42:10.590]  our children's children because it doesn't seem like anybody really gives a shit outside of
[01:42:10.590 --> 01:42:15.390]  certain little circles and that kind of stuff uh where their food comes from i know a lot of my
[01:42:15.390 --> 01:42:20.510]  peers that you know definitely have enough money to to purchase whatever they want and they eat
[01:42:20.510 --> 01:42:24.750]  mcdonald's and stuff and you kind of ask them like you know like you have everything in life
[01:42:24.750 --> 01:42:29.630]  material things and you don't focus on your food and that's something that i feel like i i even
[01:42:29.630 --> 01:42:34.750]  noticed like once i started fasting and stuff like i almost feel like you're um like what is
[01:42:34.750 --> 01:42:39.390]  that basically like the purpleness and underneath your eye um kind of tells like all right there's
[01:42:39.390 --> 01:42:44.030]  something deficient going on there and i personally learned that i was low on zinc so i feel like
[01:42:44.030 --> 01:42:48.910]  that's a gold nugget for a lot of people out there that uh want to be able to improve their immune
[01:42:48.910 --> 01:42:54.430]  system i'm learning that basically your body can't hold on to zinc like you need to be able to have
[01:42:54.430 --> 01:43:00.670]  that every day or every other day so i promise you if you improve your zinc uptake just do like
[01:43:00.670 --> 01:43:06.350]  50 milligrams a day you're going to see a definite improvement on that also with the the purpleness
[01:43:06.350 --> 01:43:12.670]  under your eye so uh health tips i guess as well on the future cannabis project but um when you're
[01:43:12.670 --> 01:43:17.550]  feeling good as a farmer like you had mentioned before tomorrow i feel like once i started to
[01:43:17.550 --> 01:43:22.830]  improve and focus on when i was eating i forgot how good you could actually feel um i feel like
[01:43:22.830 --> 01:43:27.230]  that was something i was like oh yeah like i did used to be able to kind of like work out a little
[01:43:27.230 --> 01:43:33.070]  bit stronger go a little bit longer on things and i don't know for for me i guess and i kind of have
[01:43:33.070 --> 01:43:36.990]  maybe that same journey that you were talking about now i want to go even deeper on that like
[01:43:36.990 --> 01:43:41.790]  i'm watching all these videos late at night uh you had mentioned water i i watched a like a small
[01:43:41.790 --> 01:43:47.470]  little documentary last night alone uh where this kind of like um gentleman that i guess some people
[01:43:47.550 --> 01:43:52.830]  regard as like a guru uh was talking about how the you know the human body 72 percent of water
[01:43:52.830 --> 01:43:58.110]  and so you really need to focus on that for your children as well like i think about the kind of um
[01:43:58.110 --> 01:44:01.790]  cup and that kind of stuff that you're putting the water in when you give it to your kid and god
[01:44:01.790 --> 01:44:07.470]  forbid if you're giving them juice all the time it just made a lot of sense um to me later in life
[01:44:07.470 --> 01:44:13.550]  where i felt like growing up in georgia nobody talked about health whatsoever and i i feel like
[01:44:13.550 --> 01:44:19.870]  i missed that and uh i just want to i guess give that to the community that if you could focus on
[01:44:19.870 --> 01:44:27.950]  food you are going to feel amazing i promise you that and i think the important thing is food food
[01:44:27.950 --> 01:44:32.670]  grown responsibly you know the reason we're deficient i think is because we don't have the
[01:44:32.670 --> 01:44:38.990]  biological interaction of the food production all the foods produced by feeding the plant not feeding
[01:44:38.990 --> 01:44:44.750]  the soil so that's why all of us are suffering from these crazy health fucking issues between
[01:44:44.750 --> 01:44:51.470]  immune disorders and dude when i grew up nobody was allergic to peanut butter right you know there
[01:44:51.470 --> 01:44:57.630]  was no kids you know friggin with cancer there was none of that shit nowadays you know it's all around
[01:44:57.630 --> 01:45:03.470]  you it's so in your face it's not funny if you pay attention but if you blindly go along focused
[01:45:03.470 --> 01:45:08.590]  on possession not giving a shit about what you're eating then you know your head's buried in the
[01:45:08.590 --> 01:45:13.230]  sand and you're never going to notice what's going on around you so you know that's again one of the
[01:45:13.230 --> 01:45:19.550]  reasons why i love damn cure is because they're teaching this to everybody freely about why it's
[01:45:19.550 --> 01:45:25.070]  so important to grow your own food and grow it responsibly without any synthetic inputs using
[01:45:25.070 --> 01:45:30.670]  banker plants using trap plants using polyculture using hugel culture using all these things to
[01:45:30.670 --> 01:45:36.030]  build the health of the soil so that what they're getting in return is healthy things to consume
[01:45:36.590 --> 01:45:42.510]  so thank you so much for for coming on today and and you know being a part of that message
[01:45:42.990 --> 01:45:48.510]  um for the audience and and hopefully they all hear yeah most definitely i also feel like
[01:45:49.310 --> 01:45:55.630]  about growers and our and us cultivators is that we take such good care of our plants that we forget
[01:45:55.630 --> 01:45:59.950]  to take care of ourselves sometimes and so to remembering to give yourself that nuttle tea
[01:45:59.950 --> 01:46:05.870]  that horsetail tea where you feed that plant like give it to yourself iris sea moss is like a huge
[01:46:05.870 --> 01:46:10.590]  one that i'm a huge proponent for because it's got like 98 minerals and the vitamins that your
[01:46:10.590 --> 01:46:16.670]  body needs daily and so if you're able to take that with some burdock root and some bladder whack
[01:46:16.670 --> 01:46:21.150]  you have all the minerals and vitamins your body needs for that day and if you're able to get that
[01:46:21.150 --> 01:46:27.150]  in a smoothie once a day you know twice a day is great but like once a day and get some tea in you
[01:46:27.150 --> 01:46:31.390]  you're gonna feel so much better and you're gonna be able to take care of your plants and yourself
[01:46:31.390 --> 01:46:38.430]  better and um yeah what did you say after the burdock root sorry um bladder whack bladder whack
[01:46:39.550 --> 01:46:46.270]  all right it's weird that's yeah look at you go brian you're gonna get all down this rabbit hole
[01:46:48.270 --> 01:46:53.950]  because i i really do mean that man i forgot how good you can feel if you just focus on health
[01:46:53.950 --> 01:46:59.150]  being outside all the little shit that sounds like yeah all right whatever uh but when you
[01:46:59.150 --> 01:47:04.270]  add all those little pieces up um and the main thing too is fasting i mean i talk about that
[01:47:04.270 --> 01:47:10.270]  almost every show now but fasting to me is what changed my life to see like um all right you you
[01:47:10.270 --> 01:47:15.310]  can all the bullshit in your body all that kind of stuff if you take the time to fast and again
[01:47:15.310 --> 01:47:20.270]  you have to build up to this i'm not saying like go fast for three days you've never done it before
[01:47:20.990 --> 01:47:26.670]  but just even going 12 hours is beneficial and then see if you can get to 16 18 um and if you
[01:47:26.670 --> 01:47:31.790]  can get to 18 you can probably start to live your lifestyle at 18 6 where you're obviously not
[01:47:31.790 --> 01:47:38.350]  eating for 18 hours and then you're eating in that one six hour window and at first um i feel like
[01:47:38.350 --> 01:47:44.830]  just focus on your i will i want you to go more into this but if you when you are going into the
[01:47:44.830 --> 01:47:50.510]  fasting aspect of it i noticed and it seems like a lot of people on youtube and uh people that i
[01:47:50.510 --> 01:47:54.590]  admire on youtube are saying that one of the main reasons that people have issues with that is
[01:47:54.590 --> 01:48:00.590]  because they don't focus on the the small trace minerals uh mostly also on zinc and potassium so
[01:48:00.590 --> 01:48:06.430]  their electrolytes get off uh when they're fasting they feel like they feel horrible so when i've been
[01:48:06.430 --> 01:48:11.950]  doing this kind of stuff i make sure that the potassium is up on point and the zinc is up and
[01:48:11.950 --> 01:48:16.030]  i am able to go like a few days the longest i've personally gone is four and a half days
[01:48:16.590 --> 01:48:20.510]  so i was hoping that you could talk more into that because i feel like that is another
[01:48:20.510 --> 01:48:26.350]  almost like a door to narnia for health and it's free as long as you have the the sacrifice and the
[01:48:26.350 --> 01:48:30.670]  discipline to kind of get into it and i feel like if if you are one of those kind of people that are
[01:48:30.670 --> 01:48:35.710]  diving in you know i got notes here that you've been talking all day and you just get into um
[01:48:35.710 --> 01:48:41.630]  trying to to learn and educate yourself on uh this is another level of being able to take care of
[01:48:41.630 --> 01:48:46.830]  yourself and again it's free all you got to do is stop feeding your face uh and you're going to see
[01:48:47.470 --> 01:48:53.150]  dramatic benefits so i guess i hyped that up too much but if you could go into the benefits of
[01:48:53.150 --> 01:49:00.270]  herbs with fasting yeah definitely um herb i mean fasting is definitely been a huge part of my
[01:49:00.270 --> 01:49:05.390]  journey i i definitely experimented with a lot of different fasting i was in a raw food diet for
[01:49:05.390 --> 01:49:11.230]  years but i what i realized is i got into this place where i was ready just to cleanse and cleanse
[01:49:11.310 --> 01:49:17.550]  and cleanse and so i started with the like the 12-hour fast and then like just every once it's
[01:49:17.550 --> 01:49:24.350]  one once a week you know for a full day um and then i got to where i did like that master cleanse
[01:49:24.350 --> 01:49:29.070]  with the lemon juice and maple syrup and cayenne pepper for the 30 days and that was probably one
[01:49:29.070 --> 01:49:35.390]  of my favorites you wanted to take like an herbal laxative with it um but that was like what the
[01:49:35.390 --> 01:49:41.550]  best i've like i felt like i was flying like it was so beautiful and amazing um now i'm a lot more
[01:49:41.550 --> 01:49:46.510]  gentler like i don't just do that like when i fast myself i do the lemon juice which i love and the
[01:49:46.510 --> 01:49:51.070]  cayenne sometimes i'll do the maple syrup because that has your some minerals and vitamins in there
[01:49:51.070 --> 01:49:56.590]  and it kind of keeps so your some of your sugar level up so you don't have like that full crash
[01:49:56.590 --> 01:50:02.670]  and that detox moment where you're kind of shaking um that you can have but teas metal and horsetail
[01:50:02.670 --> 01:50:09.630]  are huge um raspberry leaf because the calcium inside of it those are three um some vitamin c
[01:50:09.630 --> 01:50:16.270]  with some rose hips um i'm thinking about the tea that i take daily and that i use this is um
[01:50:17.710 --> 01:50:23.950]  some dandelion root because that's going to cleanse your love your liver um milk milk this
[01:50:23.950 --> 01:50:29.070]  will seed as well so your liver and your kidneys get cleansed with your dandelion your milk thistle
[01:50:29.070 --> 01:50:34.190]  and then um you have some nutrients you want to go in there with like your nettle and your
[01:50:34.190 --> 01:50:39.390]  horsetail so you're having cleansing herbs and you're having nutritive herbs and then i love
[01:50:39.390 --> 01:50:44.030]  the raspberry leaf it helps balance your like especially with women or estrogen or hormones but
[01:50:44.030 --> 01:50:50.830]  also it's really high in calcium um so those i like to take and then if you have a little bit
[01:50:50.830 --> 01:50:55.390]  of honey it kind of adds you know it helps with the you know maintaining that balance so you don't
[01:50:55.390 --> 01:51:01.630]  just crash so that's usually how i fast now um sometimes i'll do juicing but juicing takes a lot
[01:51:01.630 --> 01:51:07.310]  of work and a lot of effort you know you gotta have that time for it um but i i like just kind
[01:51:07.310 --> 01:51:12.030]  of keeping a balance with those herbs of having like a balance of cleansing and nutritive herbs
[01:51:12.030 --> 01:51:19.950]  so good job fasting is powerful wait again let's go so get to the like speak again about the water
[01:51:19.950 --> 01:51:23.630]  because you know most of the time when you're doing this you're drinking a lot of water
[01:51:23.630 --> 01:51:28.590]  and i personally believe that there's a dramatic difference between like dasani water
[01:51:28.590 --> 01:51:34.990]  and uh water that's coming from like a a mountain source so let's kind of uh late
[01:51:34.990 --> 01:51:39.070]  now when i talk you know bring you into those conversations but i let's get deeper into water
[01:51:39.070 --> 01:51:43.870]  because i don't think people realize how important that is to your plants as well as to to yourself
[01:51:43.870 --> 01:51:48.030]  and i guess the theme of today is you know when you're feeling good i just feel like when you're
[01:51:48.030 --> 01:51:53.150]  walking into the grow uh just life is better in general when you yourself are feeling better
[01:51:53.150 --> 01:51:57.950]  less stress uh and i promise a lot of that stress is coming from you not having enough potassium
[01:51:57.950 --> 01:52:05.390]  and zinc um it's just you're drained your adrenals are fucked up um it's hard it's hard to bounce
[01:52:05.390 --> 01:52:12.190]  back on that without you focusing on it well you know let's talk about water um we used to drink
[01:52:12.190 --> 01:52:19.310]  ground water so there was this amazing study done at rodale um i talk about the movie or the
[01:52:19.310 --> 01:52:24.750]  documentary called symphony of soil and i think everybody should watch it and once you watch it
[01:52:24.750 --> 01:52:30.430]  once you're going to want to watch it again but in the middle of the the hour and 20 minutes
[01:52:31.310 --> 01:52:34.910]  there's a demonstration done at rodale where this gentleman takes four bottles
[01:52:35.550 --> 01:52:41.150]  um a plastic bottle so you can see through them fills it up with four different types of soil
[01:52:41.150 --> 01:52:48.270]  the far right is a pure organic system the far left is a pure conventional eggs you know salt
[01:52:48.270 --> 01:52:53.550]  based uh grow so he takes 100 mils of water he pours it in the top of the bottle and you watch
[01:52:53.550 --> 01:52:58.510]  it go right through the soil on the on the conventional farming and the soil and the water
[01:52:58.510 --> 01:53:06.270]  is dark it's it's cloudy it's silty it's clay um on the other one and and pretty much like 98
[01:53:06.270 --> 01:53:10.430]  percent of the water comes through on the conventional so that means the water is gone
[01:53:10.430 --> 01:53:15.230]  it's mobile and on the far right one in the conventional system he pours the water in
[01:53:16.110 --> 01:53:22.270]  and only a few drops of water come out the bottom and it's crystal clear so that's the biology
[01:53:22.270 --> 01:53:29.310]  filtering the water right but we destroyed all of our ground water because of introduction of
[01:53:29.310 --> 01:53:37.390]  synthetic chemicals tractors you know heavy heavy uh renewer loads from you know too many horses too
[01:53:37.390 --> 01:53:43.950]  many cows whatever um so we could no longer drink the ground water or the stream or the rivers so
[01:53:43.950 --> 01:53:50.590]  then we started drilling wells and every time you drill a well you punch a hole in that beautiful
[01:53:50.590 --> 01:53:58.110]  filtration system that's mineralizing that water so as the water slowly goes back and forth between
[01:53:58.110 --> 01:54:04.430]  the cracks of these rocks all the way down into the aquifer it has been mineralized right so now
[01:54:04.430 --> 01:54:10.830]  you start sucking all that mineralized water it took years to get down there out in days or hours
[01:54:10.830 --> 01:54:17.070]  or minutes and the worst part about this is you've actually created the ability for the surface water
[01:54:17.070 --> 01:54:23.390]  to get directly down into the ground or the aquifer around the casing of the pipe that was
[01:54:23.390 --> 01:54:30.430]  drilled down there so we've poisoned all our aquifers so what is water it's it's a scary thing
[01:54:30.430 --> 01:54:36.110]  and we do not talk enough about it now there was a gentleman i met in the late 80s down on cape cod
[01:54:36.110 --> 01:54:43.230]  who had devised a method of using biology and plants to filter out water filter out manures
[01:54:44.030 --> 01:54:50.830]  you know chemicals synthetic fertilizers by using these series of tanks where the water
[01:54:50.830 --> 01:54:59.070]  flowed from one to the next to the next to the next as a matter of fact out here his son built a giant scale
[01:54:59.790 --> 01:55:06.910]  uh product project what cost him i think was two million dollars but they have 250 homes
[01:55:06.910 --> 01:55:14.430]  plus the limonera processing packing plant all the water that they use goes through this system
[01:55:14.430 --> 01:55:20.750]  and then they take the clean water and spray it out on that and so you know that's what we should
[01:55:20.750 --> 01:55:26.270]  be doing for our water we shouldn't be making municipal water pumping it with chloramines which
[01:55:26.270 --> 01:55:32.590]  are detrimental to your body and your biological health bottling water and plastic and shipping it
[01:55:32.590 --> 01:55:39.870]  all over the world that's not a fucking that's not a renewable source i mean you know where is it
[01:55:39.870 --> 01:55:44.990]  coming from a lot of the water that's being sold in in bottles is actually just run through an ro
[01:55:44.990 --> 01:55:50.590]  system which is even worse now you've stripped any little bit of mineral that was in there so how do
[01:55:50.590 --> 01:55:57.470]  you fix all this shit it's a challenge we have so many people and so much infrastructure and you
[01:55:57.470 --> 01:56:03.150]  know you're up there in that farm and you've got access to that mineral rich water beautiful but
[01:56:03.150 --> 01:56:08.030]  us people down here in babylon man we're fucked i mean you know you're damned if you do and you're
[01:56:08.030 --> 01:56:14.110]  damned if you don't and so it's it's it's a challenge and so how to make clean water and
[01:56:14.110 --> 01:56:20.110]  i've got hit up a bunch on instagram if you look back there are some really cool contraptions that
[01:56:20.110 --> 01:56:27.070]  people have invented over the years basically using soil to filter water and you pour it in
[01:56:27.070 --> 01:56:32.350]  the top and it takes time but the water comes out the bottom and you drink that and you're using
[01:56:32.350 --> 01:56:38.430]  again rocks sands minerals it kind of goes back to the horizontal soil system where you build that
[01:56:38.430 --> 01:56:43.870]  that e horizon on the bottom which is all mineral but that sand filter prevents the organic matter
[01:56:43.870 --> 01:56:49.150]  from the top from getting down and then going anaerobic as it sits in the bottom so there there
[01:56:49.150 --> 01:56:55.790]  are a lot of ways that we can do this as as a species um the problem is we're so wrapped up and
[01:56:55.790 --> 01:57:00.190]  we don't have time you know we don't time to grow our vegetables we don't have time to clean our own
[01:57:00.190 --> 01:57:04.990]  water but there are ways to doing it if if you know people are interested you just gotta do your
[01:57:04.990 --> 01:57:10.590]  work man do your diligence but the information is out there so that's what are your thoughts
[01:57:10.590 --> 01:57:16.350]  oh my god um yeah i mean my thoughts are very much in that that's one main reason i one of the
[01:57:16.350 --> 01:57:22.590]  reasons i let her left babylon was water for me water has always been this like crazy intrinsic
[01:57:22.590 --> 01:57:28.910]  part that i'm very passionate and um about in fact like when i used to travel my bus there was
[01:57:28.910 --> 01:57:34.190]  a there's a website called find a spring.com that we would travel to and that's where i'd get our
[01:57:34.190 --> 01:57:40.030]  water and i would store it in like five gallon jugs glass jugs on the bus and that's where we
[01:57:40.030 --> 01:57:45.630]  drank from we would just kind of go around to those that and hot springs that was like my thing
[01:57:46.430 --> 01:57:52.830]  um and so for me living where i'm at another thing too just like what he was saying with the
[01:57:52.830 --> 01:57:58.750]  whale water i don't use so much of my well like especially for the gardens and i really one of my
[01:57:58.750 --> 01:58:05.070]  goals is to get out of groundwater i feel like that's mama's earths and those are her veins
[01:58:05.070 --> 01:58:09.230]  and when she's ready for that water to come up it spirals up out of the earth and that's how
[01:58:09.230 --> 01:58:13.630]  she recleans herself that's how she invigorates that's the water we need to be drinking as those
[01:58:13.630 --> 01:58:21.550]  springs um because it has spiraled in and like what that does is it neutralizes any toxins and it
[01:58:21.550 --> 01:58:28.910]  makes it alive again it makes water is actually you know alive and so that is the technology when
[01:58:28.910 --> 01:58:34.590]  i do have to go to cities and i'm in cities for a while is i use um i use a berkeley filter that
[01:58:34.590 --> 01:58:40.510]  one's okay a berkey and uh but there's a new one i was just looking up the name of it that
[01:58:40.510 --> 01:58:45.790]  i want to actually travel with and it's one that it filters and totally it's amazing filter but
[01:58:45.790 --> 01:58:52.110]  then it re-invigorates that water through crystals and then it makes it come alive again so you're
[01:58:52.110 --> 01:58:57.310]  not only taking out that chlorine and whatever that nasty stuff is you're re-aligning again
[01:58:57.310 --> 01:59:02.990]  because that's how water comes alive is by putting it in motion that's why the springs and the creeks
[01:59:02.990 --> 01:59:08.750]  are clean is because it's constantly running and um but yeah those are my like thoughts of water
[01:59:08.750 --> 01:59:12.830]  for me we're really trying to get off any groundwater um with the hundred thousand gallon
[01:59:12.830 --> 01:59:19.390]  bladders i take from wearing water i have a um we take some from the springs because i have a
[01:59:20.190 --> 01:59:26.670]  an old mining um water right and but we just take in the winter and that way we're stored in those
[01:59:26.670 --> 01:59:32.990]  bladders and then i like to take it through those invigorating type of spouts to filter and that's
[01:59:32.990 --> 01:59:37.870]  like one of the next investments i want to make for the garden is like a really big apriculture
[01:59:37.870 --> 01:59:44.430]  one because then it just livens that water back up um the gel water is huge the other thing is
[01:59:44.430 --> 01:59:50.750]  oxygen um that's that's what that churning does is it builds the do in the water the the parts
[01:59:50.750 --> 01:59:54.750]  per million of water we're drinking out of tap water is like eight parts per million
[01:59:55.710 --> 02:00:00.910]  we really should be drinking rain water which is 25 parts per million oxygen that's what's
[02:00:00.990 --> 02:00:07.710]  really going to help our biology um from from so think about this way the bacteria uses the oxygen
[02:00:08.750 --> 02:00:14.270]  to do its metabolic processes so it's actually stripping oxygen out of the water which is why
[02:00:14.270 --> 02:00:21.150]  when you're doing compost teas it's very easy to go anaerobic and if you're using anaerobic water
[02:00:21.150 --> 02:00:25.150]  you're feeding the bad guys you're not feeding the good guys you're not you're not allowing
[02:00:25.150 --> 02:00:30.670]  the good biology to expand in your body so that was a really good point on on swirling
[02:00:30.670 --> 02:00:38.270]  and i think uh steiner uh rudolf steiner biodynamics a lot of work and trying to understand
[02:00:38.270 --> 02:00:43.630]  water mineralization and he had these little things where poured out of one thing into another
[02:00:43.630 --> 02:00:49.870]  certain vortexes you know right if you're doing this and circles left if you're doing that so and
[02:00:49.870 --> 02:00:56.510]  there you know the guy the guy was the guy you know i can't say i don't appreciate what he did
[02:00:56.510 --> 02:01:02.110]  he did he did take some stuff a little too far religiously i believe but the groundwork that he
[02:01:02.110 --> 02:01:08.590]  did was amazing and the guy if you if you take the time to actually listen to some of his lectures
[02:01:08.590 --> 02:01:16.750]  that have been um redone um the words are hard to understand he talks about fairies and processes
[02:01:17.390 --> 02:01:22.910]  in the soil what he didn't know was that was the fungi that was the biology we just didn't have
[02:01:22.910 --> 02:01:29.150]  the understanding back then about these forces but you know again i i think that he brought forth
[02:01:29.150 --> 02:01:34.030]  a bunch of really good information and unfortunately a lot of people disrespect
[02:01:34.830 --> 02:01:39.390]  because of some of the words he used because he just didn't have the right words at that
[02:01:39.390 --> 02:01:46.030]  point in time we didn't have the science behind it but dissolved oxygen in your water huge really
[02:01:46.030 --> 02:01:52.830]  huge tomorrow have you heard of there's some like belief systems where the the little vortex
[02:01:52.830 --> 02:01:57.950]  kind of like what you're talking about whether it's for you to drink for your own personal health
[02:01:57.950 --> 02:02:03.550]  or to do that for your plants is that water going through tubes or however that water is getting to
[02:02:03.550 --> 02:02:10.590]  you is also full of the memories of i guess this is getting more metaphysical but it is full of like
[02:02:10.590 --> 02:02:14.990]  kind of the memories of what had been going on so some people believe you know if they're going to
[02:02:14.990 --> 02:02:20.110]  drink that water they kind of like let it rest for back probably a lack of a better word from
[02:02:20.110 --> 02:02:25.310]  my understanding of it i did just kind of learn more about this last night but you just like let
[02:02:25.310 --> 02:02:30.670]  it rest there where it seems like i know a lot of the older heads here in colorado would talk about
[02:02:30.670 --> 02:02:36.430]  they love using the vortex brewers that they built with like old five gallon water water
[02:02:36.430 --> 02:02:43.390]  jugs that you can get at walmart kind of thing so it just spin do you feel like that is worth it an
[02:02:43.390 --> 02:02:47.390]  investment or probably buying a better one if you're really you know truly a commercial like
[02:02:47.390 --> 02:02:52.670]  a commercial farmer kind of thing is it worth moving that water because there is memory in that
[02:02:52.670 --> 02:03:00.190]  water and i cite for some of the like scientific more stuff i believe his name is dr emoto yeah
[02:03:01.070 --> 02:03:05.630]  fantastic can we talk more about that because i know that some people are going to shit on this
[02:03:05.630 --> 02:03:10.910]  hardcore and other people are going to love it so no i mean that's how it is yeah dr
[02:03:10.910 --> 02:03:18.350]  dr moto did a lot of great work i really studied a lot of his stuff for a while and so even when
[02:03:18.350 --> 02:03:23.150]  we would go and fill up at these springs the glass containers the thing i did not mention
[02:03:23.150 --> 02:03:28.350]  is on the outside with the sharpie i would have reiki symbols or love you know backwards going
[02:03:28.350 --> 02:03:34.830]  into this and this is a thing i still do with um almost everything i do is i'll put reiki infused
[02:03:34.830 --> 02:03:40.510]  into it because yes water definitely does hold memory it holds it absorbs it's like this crystalline
[02:03:40.670 --> 02:03:46.910]  structure you know if we're going to get into energy it's water it's powerful and so he actually
[02:03:46.910 --> 02:03:51.950]  did these studies where he would put symbols and then crystallize it and show you the like
[02:03:51.950 --> 02:03:56.590]  the crystalline structure of when you say i hate you and all these like you know awful words
[02:03:56.590 --> 02:04:02.110]  compared to i love you you are beautiful perfect you know like all these just beautiful things where
[02:04:02.110 --> 02:04:06.910]  you would talk to the water and have like all these different crystalline structures that he
[02:04:06.910 --> 02:04:11.790]  got to take pictures of so if you're able to look at his work please do because it's it's
[02:04:11.790 --> 02:04:18.350]  beautifully amazing it makes you go whoa um and so he was really big into really introducing that
[02:04:18.350 --> 02:04:26.110]  and showing like the science like there's science behind it um and so i was a big proponent into
[02:04:26.110 --> 02:04:32.670]  compost teas this this year actually i got away from my own compost teas um i love doing the
[02:04:32.670 --> 02:04:38.670]  brewers it was just i think that whole spiraling of the water um for me and brewing it and it's
[02:04:38.670 --> 02:04:43.710]  kind of like this magic you get to make happen you know it's like a little alchemy but it's it's a
[02:04:43.710 --> 02:04:47.790]  lot of work because you have to make sure it doesn't go in aerobic and if your temperatures
[02:04:47.790 --> 02:04:52.750]  change you have to be on that or you're going to lose a batch and so for me i went to um just doing
[02:04:52.750 --> 02:04:58.910]  the microbial solutions this year and the lab cultures and making my teas but before i do as
[02:04:58.910 --> 02:05:05.230]  i'm mixing all my you know teas and mixtures a lot of my jlf stradon liquid fertilizers i'll do
[02:05:05.230 --> 02:05:11.950]  in there and my jms i'm putting it into a barrel and what i do is i do the spiral i do a hundred
[02:05:11.950 --> 02:05:17.630]  waves each time and i make sure because i'm thinking about that and i know that's how like
[02:05:17.630 --> 02:05:24.350]  life starts like that is the cosmic flow of like life is this a spiral energy and so if i'm doing
[02:05:24.350 --> 02:05:28.590]  that i'm activating some things and then biodynamics they talk about that a lot of doing
[02:05:28.590 --> 02:05:34.590]  it a hundred um a hundred times each way for activating the energy in that vortex and so that
[02:05:34.590 --> 02:05:40.030]  is what i'm doing right before i feed my plants and then i'm also because i know it holds energy
[02:05:40.030 --> 02:05:44.510]  and stuff i'm putting reiki symbols into it and i'm given a little energy depending on how much
[02:05:44.510 --> 02:05:50.990]  time i have and so i'm very much of a believer in that and to speaking to your water and to you know
[02:05:50.990 --> 02:05:56.270]  writing beautiful symbols beautiful things because in your in taking that into you and i
[02:05:56.270 --> 02:06:01.070]  feel like that is another way when we're thinking about energy and how like we are these really
[02:06:01.070 --> 02:06:07.390]  powerful creators of what we think we can create so if i feel like if we do have some water from
[02:06:07.390 --> 02:06:12.750]  babylon that's like you know not really good and that's all you have the thing i will do is i will
[02:06:12.750 --> 02:06:18.030]  bless it i will pray over it and i feel like it kind of just neutralizes things and it like
[02:06:18.030 --> 02:06:22.830]  shifts the vibration of it so that's kind of like my last resort but i usually when i'm in
[02:06:22.830 --> 02:06:28.590]  babylon i have a little filter that does this whole spiral thing and neutralizes the toxins and
[02:06:28.590 --> 02:06:32.670]  i'm kind of big when i travel i travel around i love travel around the world and i always have
[02:06:32.670 --> 02:06:39.710]  my water devices with me to make sure i have good water and clean water but i love the the crystals
[02:06:40.270 --> 02:06:44.750]  that's a really big thing crystals have memory yes then this is getting into woo
[02:06:45.470 --> 02:06:51.550]  there's there is some signs indicating that this is true we now know we can store data and
[02:06:51.550 --> 02:06:57.630]  information in in different crystalline structures so that means that there is information stored in
[02:06:57.630 --> 02:07:01.950]  there even if we can't pull it out and directly access the way we think we should be able to
[02:07:02.990 --> 02:07:07.070]  yeah there's a lot of companies out there that actually put crystals in the glass bottles i
[02:07:07.070 --> 02:07:11.390]  don't know if you've seen it pauline has one of them and you can get different types of crystals
[02:07:11.390 --> 02:07:17.710]  based on your need whether it's a smoky quartz or amethyst or whatever and store your water in
[02:07:17.710 --> 02:07:28.430]  that so it's it's helping to yeah he is indeed it helps to to give that that structure i shouldn't
[02:07:28.430 --> 02:07:34.670]  probably use that word because that word has been misused a lot in water conversations you know
[02:07:35.630 --> 02:07:44.030]  about whether it's you know ec water is it is it easy water is it you know so there's again i'm just
[02:07:44.030 --> 02:07:49.630]  using these words lightly but there's definitely something to having you know waters uh crystals
[02:07:49.630 --> 02:07:55.470]  in your water and in your soil for sure we did that we did that whole thing on on meridian lines
[02:07:55.470 --> 02:07:59.710]  and everything else and yeah people the people in the chat got us got a little crazy on us but
[02:08:00.270 --> 02:08:05.790]  there it goes to show you there is stuff that we don't understand yet and to be honest with you
[02:08:05.790 --> 02:08:10.430]  it's kind of arrogant for you to think that you already know everything when science is showing
[02:08:10.430 --> 02:08:16.030]  us shit that so quickly right now it's not funny that we the more we know the more we realize we
[02:08:16.030 --> 02:08:22.190]  don't know shit right so you know to say oh there's you know there's no life in in a crystal
[02:08:22.190 --> 02:08:27.470]  or there's no memory i think is again kind of a small spirited arrogant point of view
[02:08:28.190 --> 02:08:33.550]  there's there's so much that we don't get yet and and water is a big one water is a big one i mean
[02:08:34.750 --> 02:08:41.630]  there's a guy i read his paper his last name is bali b-a-l-i i'll have to try to pick it up but
[02:08:42.590 --> 02:08:49.230]  it was one of the most complex papers i've ever read in my life and this guy he eventually gets
[02:08:49.230 --> 02:08:56.350]  a little theoretical um outside the box but you could kind of see how he could go there
[02:08:56.350 --> 02:09:01.710]  based on the science and the work that has been done and the work that he continued or furthered
[02:09:01.710 --> 02:09:08.750]  on down the path but uh peter i'll try to dig that up um so bear with me here while i chase my phone
[02:09:11.470 --> 02:09:16.590]  well tamar i mean like that documentary last night i mean it's it's basically stating you know
[02:09:16.590 --> 02:09:23.310]  you're 72 percent water um you know if i'm sitting here and i'm drinking tap water this is i guess
[02:09:23.310 --> 02:09:30.190]  another um a little rabbit hole i guess um so if i'm drinking tap water i'm getting a bunch of
[02:09:30.190 --> 02:09:36.990]  chloramine uh chlorine and then of course fluoride um and you know then if you're getting more into
[02:09:36.990 --> 02:09:42.510]  i guess certain belief systems um why is there fluoride in there have you ever seen what that
[02:09:42.510 --> 02:09:46.590]  does to a street that kind of thing and then there's a lot of people that believe that it
[02:09:46.590 --> 02:09:52.990]  calcifies third eye um are you able to speak on that a little bit for us um i can go down by
[02:09:52.990 --> 02:09:57.390]  rabbit hole a little bit i would definitely be considered one of those that can go there
[02:09:57.390 --> 02:10:04.190]  um but for me i feel like there's a lot of dumbing us down i think we are these really powerful
[02:10:04.190 --> 02:10:09.470]  creators these really powerful fucking beings and i feel like we all have superpowers you know we all
[02:10:09.470 --> 02:10:15.630]  have our own because we all have our own unique abilities and so i think a lot of times that part
[02:10:15.630 --> 02:10:23.390]  of us gets suppressed and fluoride and chlorine definitely it calcifies it also numbs you they put
[02:10:23.390 --> 02:10:30.110]  they give fluoride to prisoners um to kind of make them more numb um in prison and jail and so that's
[02:10:30.110 --> 02:10:34.830]  definitely a wide-use thing and of course we know that that was used and then concentration camps
[02:10:34.830 --> 02:10:38.190]  you know there's these poisons that they're putting why would they do that why is there
[02:10:38.190 --> 02:10:42.910]  chemtrails why is there all this stuff happening in this world for me i thought a lot about it
[02:10:42.910 --> 02:10:47.790]  it's like because i can't wrap my brain around that because for me all i want to do is help
[02:10:47.790 --> 02:10:53.230]  you know and so how can we help what would be the evilness behind that what would be that
[02:10:53.950 --> 02:10:59.070]  and i feel like there is something about control you know like wanting to control the mass kind
[02:10:59.070 --> 02:11:05.150]  of people and how you do that you dumb them down you know and if that doesn't work you completely
[02:11:05.150 --> 02:11:11.070]  berate them with distractions because if i'm not watching a show what am i doing i'm reading a book
[02:11:11.070 --> 02:11:15.710]  if i or i'm outside meditating or i'm kind of creating i'm writing i've thought that about my
[02:11:15.710 --> 02:11:20.590]  own self i'm like how many times i get distracted and i'm not working on my own like you know
[02:11:20.590 --> 02:11:25.310]  abilities or you know my own like passions because i'm like oh i'm just gonna chill out and watch the
[02:11:25.310 --> 02:11:30.110]  show you know or something along those lines and it's like we're berated constantly with that and
[02:11:30.110 --> 02:11:36.510]  then of course there's the food why is our food poison like why it's because our food also activates
[02:11:36.510 --> 02:11:43.230]  us if like we look at it we are all energy everything is energy so if that food is of a
[02:11:43.230 --> 02:11:48.910]  lower vibration and you're putting it into you you're gonna be at this lower vibration but um
[02:11:48.910 --> 02:11:54.030]  like let's say you're eating this super healthy raw foods and this is what i felt when i was i
[02:11:54.030 --> 02:12:00.350]  loved the raw food diet when i was on it for a while because i felt so alive i just like felt
[02:12:00.350 --> 02:12:05.070]  like i vibrated this higher level and as soon as i would eat something denser i would feel the shift
[02:12:05.150 --> 02:12:10.110]  immediately i'd feel more grounded but i would definitely it started making me understand how
[02:12:10.110 --> 02:12:15.070]  you can eventually become this like breatharian maybe the evolution because of being able to
[02:12:15.070 --> 02:12:21.710]  absorb from sunlight being able to absorb directly from clean water fresh air sun you know that really
[02:12:21.710 --> 02:12:28.510]  pure sunlight and um so and i think that when i have been in my most pure state i don't need my
[02:12:28.510 --> 02:12:32.750]  glasses and that's what trips me out is like i've been in rainbow gatherings where i just stopped
[02:12:32.750 --> 02:12:38.190]  using my glasses because i was being taken in the most purest a lot of times i was fasting and my
[02:12:38.190 --> 02:12:43.470]  eyesight completely cleared up and what i see is i see about a foot in front of me and everything
[02:12:43.470 --> 02:12:48.190]  else is blurry but when i'm in my most purest state and i'm like really i feel like in tune
[02:12:48.190 --> 02:12:54.910]  with nature i'm barefoot outside and i'm washing myself in the creeks i've got all those you know
[02:12:54.910 --> 02:13:02.110]  microbes all over me then i can see and i feel so fucking good and that is like the best i've ever
[02:13:02.110 --> 02:13:07.950]  felt and i think that when you go into babylon what we call babylon or whatever it's like it's
[02:13:07.950 --> 02:13:14.750]  all about bombarding ourselves with toxins and poisons and distractions to really for me i think
[02:13:14.750 --> 02:13:22.910]  it's like numbing us down so we don't know our potential so yeah it's my love just so people
[02:13:22.910 --> 02:13:29.870]  understand yes fluoride is a rat poison right and and it was given to us under the geist that it was
[02:13:29.870 --> 02:13:36.030]  going to prevent cavities there was no proof or studies done to the that showed that this
[02:13:36.670 --> 02:13:43.630]  introduction into our water was helping us and she's right they were they they used fluoride to
[02:13:43.630 --> 02:13:50.190]  get control of people um in in the prison camps to calm them down so they wouldn't you know be so
[02:13:50.190 --> 02:13:56.430]  fighting and aggravating and you know causing problems so it's it's called you know poisoning
[02:13:56.430 --> 02:14:01.950]  literally to a point where now this person is controllable now as far as chloramine is concerned
[02:14:01.950 --> 02:14:10.910]  chloramine is chlorine and uh ammonia mixed together and the craziest part about it is is that
[02:14:11.550 --> 02:14:18.190]  i think it's close to 85 of all of our water treatment facilities are over treating and the
[02:14:18.190 --> 02:14:26.670]  way they measure that they have enough chlorine chloramine in the system is that once um they start
[02:14:26.670 --> 02:14:34.110]  seeing excess ammonia or excess chlorine now they know they've bonded to every single water molecule
[02:14:34.110 --> 02:14:40.750]  there but what they're not talking about is what is the strength of that bond and how bad is that
[02:14:40.750 --> 02:14:46.590]  for the human body i mean the reason they brought chloramine in was because chlorine so easily gassed
[02:14:47.150 --> 02:14:54.190]  you know we when i was younger when we had heavily chlora chlorine water all we did was stir it and
[02:14:54.190 --> 02:14:58.350]  the gas came off you could smell it like crazy but then once you got done stirring it you couldn't
[02:14:58.350 --> 02:15:03.550]  smell it anymore then you knew it was time to go ahead and drink it um so that's why they came up
[02:15:03.550 --> 02:15:09.790]  with a chloramine molecule so that it wasn't as easily broken and the craziest thing about this
[02:15:09.790 --> 02:15:18.110]  is is that when you introduce organic matter to chloramine it breaks into what's called a secondary
[02:15:18.110 --> 02:15:24.990]  disinfected by-product google that shit it's horrifying absolutely horrifying what it's doing
[02:15:24.990 --> 02:15:29.870]  for our health and in a lot of these third world countries where they're actually storing the water
[02:15:29.870 --> 02:15:34.510]  in a reservoir so there's going to be a lot of tannin there's going to be a lot of organic matter
[02:15:34.510 --> 02:15:40.270]  floating around in the in the you know humus or humate or humic acid whatever you want to call it
[02:15:40.270 --> 02:15:46.270]  it's already in the water so then they pump in this chloramine by the time that pipe gets down
[02:15:46.270 --> 02:15:52.110]  to the end of that run the people drinking that are getting whacked with these secondary disinfectant
[02:15:52.110 --> 02:15:57.310]  by-products and their health is collapsing now they're like oh well how do we fix this and it's
[02:15:57.310 --> 02:16:02.430]  like you got to get rid of this shit you can't fix it because mother nature is going to do what
[02:16:02.430 --> 02:16:08.590]  mother nature does so yeah we've got we've got a lot of issues with with you know babylon water
[02:16:08.590 --> 02:16:13.230]  and it's global it's not just here in the us as a matter of fact it's way worse in these developing
[02:16:13.230 --> 02:16:19.710]  countries so yeah i'm sorry i didn't mean to go dark and deep but you know just so people understand
[02:16:19.710 --> 02:16:25.950]  that even if you take water and you add you know humic acid what you're doing is you are getting
[02:16:25.950 --> 02:16:31.550]  some of these secondary by-products yes you're breaking the molecule apart so that the chlorine
[02:16:31.550 --> 02:16:37.230]  can gas off and the ammonia can be absorbed by the biology but you're still making these secondary
[02:16:37.230 --> 02:16:44.030]  metabolites that that are detrimental to human health and then all of them all is 24 hours i
[02:16:44.030 --> 02:16:49.470]  always felt like that was the metric is that a solid metric there uh for chlorine to to gas off
[02:16:49.470 --> 02:16:56.750]  if you bubble it um actually no chlorine just straight chlorine um you can gas off in a matter
[02:16:56.830 --> 02:17:04.110]  of minutes uh they say chloramine can get gassed off in 24 hours that's bro science it doesn't gas
[02:17:04.110 --> 02:17:10.590]  off i've not yeah i had in water and bubbled it for like two weeks to try to get rid of that shit
[02:17:11.390 --> 02:17:18.190]  in in my shop in bantam i'm at the end of one of these runs and so all the shit collects right at
[02:17:18.190 --> 02:17:25.070]  the end so our level of chlorochloramine is just horrific and i actually had to bring in water i
[02:17:25.070 --> 02:17:30.830]  was actually pumping out of the river or bringing from well uh to mix my biologicals because i
[02:17:30.830 --> 02:17:39.070]  couldn't use the town water and so no the only way to break the chloramine bond is to use a hemic acid
[02:17:39.070 --> 02:17:47.150]  or hemic substance so charcoal filters and all that and the yeah charcoal helps but a lot of it
[02:17:47.150 --> 02:17:54.830]  still gets through um and you in the charcoal is all about surface time so the water can't just
[02:17:54.830 --> 02:17:59.070]  run through there like a lot of people put those little charcoal filters on their hoses
[02:17:59.070 --> 02:18:06.350]  it's going to help but it's all about the time the contact time of the water with the uh activated
[02:18:06.350 --> 02:18:12.750]  carbon that's the key to the whole thing so now you know 20 of these filters in a row to so that
[02:18:12.990 --> 02:18:18.030]  the water has enough to contact time with the activated carbon to strip all of that
[02:18:18.030 --> 02:18:24.270]  so then then it gets cost prohibitive so yeah it's it water is a freaking huge issue man and i i just
[02:18:24.270 --> 02:18:29.710]  texted the boys to see if i can get that paper because i scrolled back till freaking october
[02:18:29.710 --> 02:18:37.950]  of last year and i couldn't find it i found oh sorry go ahead no i was just going to say water
[02:18:37.950 --> 02:18:41.790]  is like an afterthought for a lot of a lot of people in their life as well as farmers
[02:18:42.990 --> 02:18:48.510]  i think they're just they might not realize just those small little things like i was mentioning
[02:18:48.510 --> 02:18:53.230]  you know that really add up um and i appreciate you guys kind of going there with me and talking
[02:18:53.230 --> 02:18:57.950]  more of uh maybe some of the fringe things i feel like for some of those science-driven
[02:18:57.950 --> 02:19:04.350]  uh cannabis farmers um but again like when you mentioned the ley lines and stuff like that when
[02:19:04.350 --> 02:19:08.670]  people are making fun of that it doesn't really make sense to me because we had mentioned that
[02:19:08.670 --> 02:19:14.830]  all of those um mansions and that kind of stuff especially those scottish yards and that kind of
[02:19:14.830 --> 02:19:20.190]  stuff those are all built on those ley lines so there's got to be something to energy if the
[02:19:20.190 --> 02:19:28.510]  ultra ultra elite are taking the time to build compounds basically castles on those ley lines
[02:19:28.510 --> 02:19:33.150]  and then there's the rosalind chapel i don't know if you've you know i don't know how deep we could
[02:19:33.150 --> 02:19:37.230]  go into this kind of stuff but the rosalind chapel's on that kind of stuff and water is very
[02:19:37.230 --> 02:19:43.390]  important so i just i don't know i just i feel like later in life i i just want more and more
[02:19:43.390 --> 02:19:48.670]  people to understand that i think water if you're drinking tap water every day uh you might need to
[02:19:48.670 --> 02:19:53.230]  rethink that or start to study this shit you know don't take anything we're saying just go go research
[02:19:53.230 --> 02:19:58.270]  this stuff for yourself and see where those ley lines exist and why why are there castles built
[02:19:58.270 --> 02:20:03.790]  on that why was water so important especially back in the day um and farmers and ranchers those were
[02:20:03.790 --> 02:20:10.750]  the real i feel like um people of importance you know i definitely feel like they were especially
[02:20:10.750 --> 02:20:16.430]  the ranchers and that kind of stuff were just you know i have a there's a guy that right behind me
[02:20:16.430 --> 02:20:20.350]  and back in my yard here he's been trying to farm it seems like for like 10 years
[02:20:20.990 --> 02:20:25.310]  and all i ever see him successfully grow is corn and i would imagine that's because it's
[02:20:25.310 --> 02:20:30.910]  subsidized by the government you know but he flies the plane over sprays the pesticides i mean
[02:20:33.790 --> 02:20:38.190]  it's huge it goes through our whole you know behind our entire uh little neighborhood here
[02:20:38.910 --> 02:20:43.550]  but i don't think that guy he can't be really turning a profit and i know that the water out
[02:20:43.550 --> 02:20:52.270]  here can't be that great because they frack oh god fracking is yeah probably the worst possible
[02:20:52.270 --> 02:20:59.070]  thing we could do because it's collapsing aquifers it's polluting those mineral fractures where all
[02:20:59.070 --> 02:21:05.230]  of that beautiful water mineralization is happening and yeah that's fracking don't get
[02:21:05.230 --> 02:21:12.430]  me started on that one let's uh change the subject please yeah it's rough it's rough um
[02:21:12.430 --> 02:21:17.310]  yeah just like you were saying the ley lines not only is like you know modern day humans we also
[02:21:17.310 --> 02:21:22.830]  have our ancient civilizations that were built on that you know we have all of the you know stone
[02:21:22.830 --> 02:21:27.390]  hinge and things that are even more ancient and any of the temples they're built close to usually
[02:21:27.390 --> 02:21:32.830]  really good water and ley lines i thought that's interesting like when we travel around the world
[02:21:32.830 --> 02:21:39.070]  that's like my favorite thing to do is go to those kind of sacred spots and it's it's fascinating to
[02:21:39.070 --> 02:21:43.950]  me because there is an accumulation of energy and it's just kind of like what were people doing here
[02:21:43.950 --> 02:21:49.070]  why would they create something so moment you know momentous if there wasn't something to this
[02:21:49.070 --> 02:21:54.750]  you know there's yeah and the more you tune in the more you tapped into yourself and like you're
[02:21:54.750 --> 02:22:00.030]  the earth and walk barefoot and drink clean water and eat clean food the more you understand
[02:22:00.030 --> 02:22:06.750]  that what we're saying is not like crazy nonsense and it also can be dangerous because it's like
[02:22:06.750 --> 02:22:14.510]  taking that red pill man yeah i feel like now's the time to take that pill finally because
[02:22:15.950 --> 02:22:21.710]  when else if you if you don't believe that some shit is probably going to happen in our world in
[02:22:21.710 --> 02:22:27.630]  the next few years i don't think you're really paying attention um there's a lot of things that
[02:22:27.630 --> 02:22:33.870]  our country is doing right now it's pissing off a lot of our allies and so i feel like if you're
[02:22:33.870 --> 02:22:41.230]  not focused at least on trying to educate yourself and and grow for experience just a little um you
[02:22:41.230 --> 02:22:46.670]  know a little outdoor garden or if your hoa allows it i would uh let's shout out to um
[02:22:47.630 --> 02:22:52.430]  uh genome genome alchemy you know when i go over to his house he's a seed breeder tomorrow
[02:22:52.430 --> 02:22:57.950]  uh here in denver kind of a my opinion like a little local celebrity uh so shout out to him but
[02:22:57.950 --> 02:23:02.990]  he lives and breathes it man he's able to live in a place where the front of his house looks like
[02:23:02.990 --> 02:23:08.590]  uh like a farmer's market to me in the back uh you know he just continues into the backyard and
[02:23:08.590 --> 02:23:15.070]  he has this like kind of like ua oasis in the middle of like an urban area uh so i that i feel
[02:23:15.070 --> 02:23:21.310]  like if you can kind of get your stuff or start thinking that way at least because um i'll be
[02:23:21.310 --> 02:23:26.670]  i'll be honest with you guys i'm kind of nervous with um some of the stuff that's happening and
[02:23:26.670 --> 02:23:33.550]  if if you're not able to have clean water and take care of your family things are things might change
[02:23:34.990 --> 02:23:39.470]  it's true it's true i also feel like people that are in like those neighborhoods like you're saying
[02:23:39.470 --> 02:23:43.870]  you're in and like this the that man that's doing that farm right there those are freaking
[02:23:43.950 --> 02:23:48.910]  warriors that's the warrior work you know for me i got i jumped out and i'm able to kind of do what
[02:23:48.910 --> 02:23:53.710]  i'm doing from a different perspective but like it's warrior work you know you're gonna have to
[02:23:53.710 --> 02:23:58.190]  learn how to bake you know like there's a i was just looking up there's the pristine hydra
[02:23:58.830 --> 02:24:03.310]  dot com is one of that one that does the really cleaning out but has like a 10-step filter with
[02:24:03.310 --> 02:24:08.670]  restructuring or re you know invigorating your water there's the berkey filters you're finding
[02:24:08.670 --> 02:24:15.470]  how you can re clean your water and make it alive again and then grow as many things as possible i
[02:24:15.470 --> 02:24:20.830]  feel like that's another part of us is like what i always try to think about is like when they're
[02:24:20.830 --> 02:24:25.230]  the world is like so much chaos and there's so much shit going on and there's so much bad shit
[02:24:25.230 --> 02:24:30.110]  happening i'm like how the hell can i help how what can i do and then i realized like this is
[02:24:30.110 --> 02:24:35.070]  what we could all do is like fulfill our purpose here like what is our human potential what is my
[02:24:35.070 --> 02:24:41.630]  purpose if i'm in tune with my purpose then i'm going to be of that highest service to humanity
[02:24:41.630 --> 02:24:45.950]  and i feel like one of those ways of getting to that purpose and getting back to myself is
[02:24:45.950 --> 02:24:51.470]  touching the earth growing things getting more in tune with her because we are so interconnected
[02:24:51.470 --> 02:24:56.030]  and getting your health you're getting that clean water getting that pure food because then you like
[02:24:56.030 --> 02:25:01.870]  your brain is unfogged and then you're like oh this is what i'm supposed to be doing you know
[02:25:01.870 --> 02:25:06.990]  and then like following that path by following like where you feel good what makes you feel good
[02:25:06.990 --> 02:25:11.310]  and that's what we do because that's where our purpose lies you know and so i feel like the
[02:25:11.310 --> 02:25:16.910]  people that are in neighborhoods if you can do that and like really show have that farmer's market
[02:25:16.910 --> 02:25:21.550]  have that forest looking gardens have that food not lawns you know it's definitely part of that
[02:25:21.550 --> 02:25:27.310]  movement where we created a lot of food instead of lawns for in some neighborhoods that was fun
[02:25:27.310 --> 02:25:32.750]  but that's huge it just gets people like oh i could do that that's beautiful oh that's cool
[02:25:32.750 --> 02:25:37.390]  what are you doing you know it triggers that and that awareness starts happening you know where
[02:25:37.950 --> 02:25:43.390]  it's just that escalating i feel like our evolution so warrior work for people inside
[02:25:43.390 --> 02:25:49.390]  babylon really doing it yeah and that's kind of what we're doing here is helping people understand
[02:25:49.390 --> 02:25:54.990]  of you know some of the tricks and techniques that do help you and you know i loved what you
[02:25:54.990 --> 02:25:59.230]  brought up about grounding you know brian and i've talked about that you know i don't care if
[02:25:59.230 --> 02:26:04.430]  you're in the middle of the city you can go to the beach collect some sand put it put it in a box
[02:26:04.430 --> 02:26:09.150]  or a pan fill it with a little bit of water and just put your feet in there and rest and you will
[02:26:09.150 --> 02:26:13.790]  feel the difference you know grounding is real and and you know if you don't want to walk around
[02:26:13.790 --> 02:26:19.230]  in the city with bare feet that gets cut by all the glass shards this is a way to do it you know
[02:26:19.230 --> 02:26:23.630]  and i don't care if you're on the 30th floor of the building you still connect to the concrete
[02:26:23.630 --> 02:26:31.310]  and the iron that are holding you up i forget what those uh those rooms are that are all steel
[02:26:31.310 --> 02:26:39.710]  bars around that are grounded um prison well there's ones that they use to protect you against
[02:26:39.710 --> 02:26:48.190]  certain magnetic waves anyway i won't go there that's another deep rabbit hole that's cool i
[02:26:48.190 --> 02:26:53.870]  don't know about that one last little rabbit hole for the audience i feel like is if we could
[02:26:53.870 --> 02:26:59.310]  talk uh tomorrow and late and about leaf litter um i don't think people really understand myself
[02:26:59.310 --> 02:27:04.430]  included when i was first getting into this guy gave me so much leaf litter and i just didn't
[02:27:04.430 --> 02:27:08.590]  appreciate what he gave me i didn't understand what it was so that was something i hope that
[02:27:08.590 --> 02:27:14.670]  we could kind of talk on uh just the importance of kind of organic matter decomposing breaking
[02:27:14.670 --> 02:27:21.230]  down chop and drop all of those things uh in addition with um adding wood basically
[02:27:22.750 --> 02:27:27.710]  there it is faraday cage thank you shaan t much appreciate you guys look into that
[02:27:27.710 --> 02:27:32.270]  it's pretty crazy shit um i think i think the big thing with leaf litter is that
[02:27:33.310 --> 02:27:40.350]  you are getting the endophytic biology because both fungal and bacteria are stored in those
[02:27:40.350 --> 02:27:46.430]  leaves and when that leaf lands on the ground those endophytes become sap ropes so they actually
[02:27:46.430 --> 02:27:52.510]  start breaking down that organic matter um and if that leaf falls into a stream it could be an
[02:27:52.510 --> 02:28:02.910]  aquatic um sap rope and so that was why we brought um dr david white no um come on layton you remember
[02:28:02.910 --> 02:28:12.430]  the show we did on the end of lights james white jane's wife oh james white yes dr james white
[02:28:12.430 --> 02:28:19.870]  correct he he's an amazing guy he's just so easy to talk to he's not full of himself um and he will
[02:28:19.870 --> 02:28:24.910]  go into theory with you which is a pleasure because a lot of scientists are afraid to step
[02:28:24.910 --> 02:28:30.830]  outside of the box so to say um but he'll he'll he'll chop it up and explain it to you on the
[02:28:30.830 --> 02:28:36.190]  level that it's easy to understand and that's that's really the key to that leaf litter and
[02:28:36.190 --> 02:28:42.110]  and the chopping and dropping that what you're doing is you're bio mimicking nature's own system
[02:28:42.750 --> 02:28:48.270]  and the more often we can do that the better off we are going to be as far as creating healthy
[02:28:48.270 --> 02:28:54.110]  environment for our plants as well as providing them all of the biological constituents that they
[02:28:54.110 --> 02:29:00.590]  need to continue their whole cycle remember it's a big big loop it's not just a you know the seasons
[02:29:00.910 --> 02:29:07.950]  it's years of of evolution the soil is always moving in a new direction the weeds they're not
[02:29:07.950 --> 02:29:13.310]  weeds they're indicator plants they're pulling some kind of nutrient out of the soil to prepare
[02:29:13.310 --> 02:29:19.790]  that soil for the next successionary plant system to come and play so yeah leaf litter is is probably
[02:29:19.790 --> 02:29:26.670]  one of the most valuable um tools that that we have and yet everybody puts their bags and freaking
[02:29:26.670 --> 02:29:33.550]  in landfills it's the insanity of humanity i mean you've heard me talk about this gom project
[02:29:33.550 --> 02:29:40.110]  so gom is ground up organic matter and it's coming in in millions of tons into
[02:29:41.150 --> 02:29:46.270]  all of these recycling centers and landfills and in california they've basically said by
[02:29:46.270 --> 02:29:53.310]  december 31st 2022 green waste and food waste will no longer be allowed to be diverted to landfills
[02:29:53.550 --> 02:30:02.750]  what are they going to do with 20 million tons which is equivalent to two and a half to three
[02:30:02.750 --> 02:30:11.870]  and a half yards 60 million yards per year right so they brought me in to try to figure out how to
[02:30:11.870 --> 02:30:17.150]  arrest it how to mineralize it and how to biologically activate it so that it at least
[02:30:17.150 --> 02:30:21.790]  has some value because right now they're only processing about two and a half to three and a
[02:30:21.790 --> 02:30:28.670]  half million yards which is think about that million yards a year and 80 of it is getting
[02:30:28.670 --> 02:30:35.790]  dumped on agricultural fields as a herbicide to kill kill off the fucking weeds um and then being
[02:30:35.790 --> 02:30:40.910]  tilled in as a carbon source which it's scary as it sounds it's actually better than putting in a
[02:30:40.910 --> 02:30:47.950]  fucking landfill right um but if if it didn't kill plants then they could actually sell it
[02:30:47.950 --> 02:30:53.630]  imagine that right and by default we'd be fucking cleaning up the surface of the earth
[02:30:53.630 --> 02:31:00.030]  by building soil everywhere in babylon everywhere all the parks all the you know the little home
[02:31:00.030 --> 02:31:05.390]  gardeners um all the sports fields like there's another mandate that they've got to start getting
[02:31:05.390 --> 02:31:11.870]  away from pesticides so a lot of the school systems are looking for quality compost to use
[02:31:11.870 --> 02:31:17.710]  as a top dressing to help build the soil help bring back the indigenous pests or not the pests
[02:31:17.710 --> 02:31:23.390]  the predators and they've shown really good success but the problem is no one's making good
[02:31:23.390 --> 02:31:30.670]  compost it's this municipal waste compost that's gone that's basically gassing off ammonia so
[02:31:30.670 --> 02:31:37.070]  you're losing your nitrogen sources you're losing all of that beneficial fertilizers that could be
[02:31:37.550 --> 02:31:43.230]  you know helping the biology grow helping the plant grow and instead it's just gassing off
[02:31:43.230 --> 02:31:52.030]  which nobody talks about that methane and freaking ammonia so much worse than co2 like
[02:31:52.030 --> 02:31:58.030]  off the scale thousands of times worse and yet we've got piles of these gum in every municipal
[02:31:58.990 --> 02:32:04.670]  waste facility that all you smell is ammonia when you walk up and and and breathe it or touch it
[02:32:05.310 --> 02:32:10.590]  so you know co2 that's just a that's a joke we really need to be looking at these other
[02:32:10.590 --> 02:32:17.390]  greenhouse gases that are way way more detrimental to the environment but yeah solving problems
[02:32:17.390 --> 02:32:23.470]  we're warrior work i love it and you know that's that's really what it's all about is building your
[02:32:23.470 --> 02:32:28.910]  soul making yourself feel better connecting with earth yeah that red pill's a jagged one to fucking
[02:32:28.910 --> 02:32:35.230]  swallow but you know it's it's good for your soul it'll make you a better person and hopefully you'll
[02:32:35.230 --> 02:32:39.950]  you'll infect others to start thinking this way because if we don't get our shit together
[02:32:40.830 --> 02:32:46.670]  as a species we're just fucking skipping blindly into oblivion at this point
[02:32:46.670 --> 02:32:50.510]  and so wake up people drop that fucking red pill and get to work
[02:32:53.950 --> 02:32:55.630]  tamar what are your thoughts on leaf litter
[02:32:58.110 --> 02:33:04.990]  i'm definitely not as scientifically turned but i think what i feel with it is i don't fucking
[02:33:04.990 --> 02:33:12.590]  love it like there's the mycelium you know that you're able to utilize to um that's right there
[02:33:12.590 --> 02:33:19.150]  like i use the leaf litter that's right beside the trees beside my garden and so i know that
[02:33:19.150 --> 02:33:24.990]  i'm able to take the microbial life that's right there and introduce it more into the garden into
[02:33:24.990 --> 02:33:30.030]  the same environment and i love that so much more than when i used to buy you know microbials for
[02:33:30.110 --> 02:33:35.950]  $800 a fucking bucket and those were from the sea and they didn't even grow in my environment you
[02:33:35.950 --> 02:33:42.990]  know and so to me i i just love this able to go and collect and to see the mycelium working because
[02:33:42.990 --> 02:33:47.790]  i mean that is breaking all that leaf down into nutrients so we know if we're taking that and
[02:33:47.790 --> 02:33:54.030]  putting that into our hugels around our plants or giving like those microbes in there with teas
[02:33:54.030 --> 02:33:58.030]  then they're going to work because they're in their same environment and they're going to start
[02:33:58.030 --> 02:34:04.430]  breaking down that wood and making those nutrients available and another reason that i did the hugels
[02:34:04.430 --> 02:34:10.510]  and i wanted to have long rows was because i knew the mycelium network could go completely throughout
[02:34:10.510 --> 02:34:15.870]  that without having individual little beds you know and that was really important because that
[02:34:15.870 --> 02:34:20.830]  way you know that if like this plant needs a nutrient it's way over here it could go real
[02:34:20.830 --> 02:34:26.590]  around that like length real fast and get it back to it and so adding i feel like those my that
[02:34:26.590 --> 02:34:33.070]  mycelium from that leaf litter is really important and um that's a huge part of like my growing and
[02:34:33.070 --> 02:34:40.990]  so and also i want to talk about too like when you take give back and so what i do is i'll have some
[02:34:40.990 --> 02:34:47.470]  compost left if i do an extract tea or if i have some of that leaf litter left that leaf mold left
[02:34:47.470 --> 02:34:53.230]  from after doing a jadon microbial solution i'll go put some of that back exactly where i found it
[02:34:53.230 --> 02:34:58.750]  and i'll take from another place and then later i'll go and usually what i have put back has grown
[02:34:58.750 --> 02:35:03.790]  tenfold because it's like all up in there and it's more wet and so i think it's a really good
[02:35:03.790 --> 02:35:08.830]  thing to talk about is to to also when you're out in nature and you're taking from nature
[02:35:08.830 --> 02:35:14.350]  because that is its food and especially on a place like mine there's not very much of it
[02:35:14.350 --> 02:35:19.230]  where there's more rock and desert environment i always make sure that i give just as much back
[02:35:19.230 --> 02:35:25.710]  if not more and um but yeah i think that's a huge it's a huge element to growing it changed my whole
[02:35:25.710 --> 02:35:33.230]  way i did everything once i started understanding mycelium yeah i love the part of giving back like
[02:35:33.230 --> 02:35:39.550]  i tell people if you're going to wild craft leaf litter or you know sand silt or clay out of nature
[02:35:39.550 --> 02:35:44.670]  bring a bucket of something in with you something that you did and then take the bucket but never
[02:35:44.670 --> 02:35:49.550]  leave scars never collect the leaf litter and don't put something back and leave an open wound
[02:35:49.550 --> 02:35:55.470]  in nature because that's that's going to bring you some bad karma at the very little least um peter i
[02:35:55.470 --> 02:36:01.230]  just forwarded you that paper on ball um put it up for people if they want to check it out it's it's
[02:36:01.230 --> 02:36:09.070]  a really really deep rabbit hole into water and what is it um i think spending the time to educate
[02:36:09.070 --> 02:36:14.030]  yourself on water whether if it's for your personal health or for your farm uh is time well spent
[02:36:15.390 --> 02:36:20.670]  definitely that's like the first thing when i work with people um i do a lot of one-on-one
[02:36:20.670 --> 02:36:25.470]  consultations and so when someone comes to me when the first thing and depending on like what
[02:36:25.470 --> 02:36:30.670]  cancer is going on or if there's lime or you know just whatever's going on i'm like what is your
[02:36:30.670 --> 02:36:36.270]  food what is your water source you know how are you feeling what is your emotions like every day
[02:36:36.270 --> 02:36:40.430]  you know all these things really matter into health but our water source is like we've been
[02:36:40.430 --> 02:36:46.110]  talking about it's so important you can't cleanse yourself you cannot detox yourself if you're that
[02:36:46.110 --> 02:36:52.190]  that carrier for those nutrients and those herbs is filled with toxins so it doesn't work so you
[02:36:52.190 --> 02:36:58.270]  have to have some kind of clean water and find that source find a spring.com is a really good
[02:36:58.270 --> 02:37:02.990]  resource i believe it's still up and it's another one that you can search out your local springs in
[02:37:02.990 --> 02:37:08.830]  your area that you can go and fill up with and um but other than that like i said the berkey's pretty
[02:37:08.830 --> 02:37:14.750]  good but the the pristine hydro i think is what it's called is one of the new ones i've seen but
[02:37:14.750 --> 02:37:20.590]  just you know do your research find some really good ways to get those contaminants out and to
[02:37:20.590 --> 02:37:30.830]  re-energize re-alive in that water. And then the uh yeah that's the paper hell yeah it's crazy
[02:37:30.830 --> 02:37:39.470]  crazy deep. Oh wow. So where would they find that Clayton is that uh deep? Peter put the link
[02:37:39.470 --> 02:37:43.630]  i would say just take a picture take a take your phone and grab a screenshot of that
[02:37:44.190 --> 02:37:49.950]  um i know it's a pain in the ass but um i don't know other any other way to give a quick link
[02:37:49.950 --> 02:37:56.590]  out on this platform. I think i think Peter gave us a link in the comments and he just popped it
[02:37:56.750 --> 02:38:04.350]  on the link in the comments or use your google abilities and type in water as an active
[02:38:04.350 --> 02:38:13.230]  constituent in cell biology. There you go that's why you got an Emmy Peter. Common sense.
[02:38:16.990 --> 02:38:22.110]  So uh Tamara i know uh one of the other nuggets i learned uh well i guess you're kind of like
[02:38:22.110 --> 02:38:26.670]  went deeper on is you know some of those people that are spending a lot of money on biologicals
[02:38:27.230 --> 02:38:32.350]  and then going out of their way i feel like maybe trying to take care of their plants maybe
[02:38:32.350 --> 02:38:36.750]  sometimes we do a little too much and then going out of their way to make those essential oils.
[02:38:37.390 --> 02:38:40.590]  So i was wondering if we could kind of maybe talk about that topic and then
[02:38:40.590 --> 02:38:45.150]  i'm sure the audience has some questions for you. What about essential oils though?
[02:38:45.950 --> 02:38:53.310]  How it kills the the biologicals? Oh yes yes and so i love essential oils like i said i use them a
[02:38:53.310 --> 02:38:58.030]  lot in our products and stuff but they are extremely powerful they are very concentrated
[02:38:58.030 --> 02:39:04.190]  like you know particles and those compounds of those plants and in tiny drops and so any of that
[02:39:04.190 --> 02:39:10.590]  any essential oil is anti-viral anti-microbial like anti-everything anti-fungal and so if you're
[02:39:10.590 --> 02:39:15.310]  putting that directly onto your plants you're killing your biology that you have just cultivated
[02:39:15.310 --> 02:39:18.910]  your good and your bad you might be killing the bad but you're also killing the good
[02:39:19.550 --> 02:39:25.630]  um which you know if you do afterwards i would come i mean let's say you that's what you have
[02:39:25.630 --> 02:39:31.630]  if you have that on hand okay use that and then afterwards do a lab or a jms to draw microbial
[02:39:31.630 --> 02:39:38.190]  solution and spray that plant with it again re re like grow your microbials but i would recommend
[02:39:38.190 --> 02:39:45.870]  not using that and like the best like pesticide and way i've found is the jadam herbal solution
[02:39:45.870 --> 02:39:50.590]  which is taking those same exact plants like i my favorites are right now are rosemary and mint
[02:39:50.590 --> 02:39:56.750]  they smell so good and you just take those herbs and i use like two pounds per gallon of water and
[02:39:56.750 --> 02:40:03.870]  then i'll boil that for five hours and then you strain it and um you put those in containers you
[02:40:03.870 --> 02:40:09.230]  know you want to make sure it's like you have sanitized containers so that way you can store it
[02:40:10.270 --> 02:40:16.750]  and then you use that to like a 30 to 1 with your water and put a little biological soap in there
[02:40:17.310 --> 02:40:23.550]  and that has been the best thing i have seen for taking out any pests yes and like this is another
[02:40:23.550 --> 02:40:27.710]  one i started doing for i had thrips this year you know every year you have some kind of bug and
[02:40:27.710 --> 02:40:34.110]  this year was just thrips it's no big deal and so i i kept it maintained um once a week and i
[02:40:34.110 --> 02:40:38.990]  started doing once every two weeks with the jadam herbal solution and this year i started playing
[02:40:38.990 --> 02:40:43.870]  with a bunch of others like i have bay laurel and juniper at my house and of course those are
[02:40:43.870 --> 02:40:49.790]  smelly plants you that's the way you can kind of tell what one of the herbs are that you can use
[02:40:49.790 --> 02:40:54.750]  is if it's like super smelly and so i combined those and it took out everything including the
[02:40:54.830 --> 02:40:59.230]  aphids on my trap plants because i wanted to see you know if this is going to work and that's
[02:40:59.230 --> 02:41:03.790]  another thing kind of fun about your trap plants is you're able to see if something that you're
[02:41:03.790 --> 02:41:09.470]  going to use is going to work because it'll kill those bugs that are there but i like using the
[02:41:09.470 --> 02:41:16.590]  full plants instead of any time of essential oils and that it keeps your microbial life and balance
[02:41:16.590 --> 02:41:23.230]  and it's not as hard it's not as harsh so how are you boiling it for five hours without boiling off
[02:41:23.230 --> 02:41:30.510]  all the water um okay so i boil it i put it on high to boil and then afterwards it's good to the
[02:41:30.510 --> 02:41:36.750]  high and everything's boiling i'll put it to like like maybe a medium to low um and just kind of let
[02:41:36.750 --> 02:41:45.550]  it simmer boil and yeah it works you have a lid on you know okay and so another way too is i really
[02:41:45.550 --> 02:41:51.950]  like using it in my um crock pots the crock pots are an easy way to do it especially like the bay
[02:41:52.030 --> 02:41:59.070]  laurel is so strong that i have to do it outside in a crock pot it just becomes crazy potent so
[02:41:59.070 --> 02:42:03.550]  much that i actually use a mask and gloves when i'm handling it and so that's one that i've
[02:42:03.550 --> 02:42:08.270]  actually started mixing with others like the juniper or the mint or rosemary just because
[02:42:08.270 --> 02:42:13.550]  it's so strong but a crock pot is a really easy way to do that you turn on high and then you just
[02:42:13.550 --> 02:42:19.390]  put on medium um but if you just have a pot and you have your stove you can easily you know just
[02:42:19.390 --> 02:42:25.230]  do it with the two pounds per gallon and i put all the herbs in a straining bag and then put that
[02:42:25.230 --> 02:42:31.550]  in a big old rock on top so it's all underneath the water and a lid on top and you just let that
[02:42:31.550 --> 02:42:38.590]  go you know i love what you said about smelling the plants right so if the plant smells that's
[02:42:38.590 --> 02:42:45.230]  called a volatile organic compound or a perfume it's just like the canvas plant it's giving that
[02:42:45.230 --> 02:42:51.070]  off as a defense so obviously it can be used in other manners to defend plants that are being
[02:42:51.950 --> 02:42:56.750]  attacked so i love the way you put that that was that was beautiful there's a little gold nugget
[02:42:56.750 --> 02:43:05.150]  for the audience you can use anything that smells hopefully smells good yeah for some of those
[02:43:05.150 --> 02:43:11.550]  farmers that um are combat russet mites is there um something that you feel like is tried and true
[02:43:11.550 --> 02:43:18.750]  on the commercial level to combat that with a more like natural farming approach i would try
[02:43:18.750 --> 02:43:24.830]  some of the more stronger ones like um i've had i'm trying to think when i had the my the bite
[02:43:24.830 --> 02:43:30.830]  issue the judah the um jerusalem artichoke is really good and you take that full plant and you
[02:43:30.830 --> 02:43:36.270]  want it when the best time to get it is when it is in the fall when you have that full plant and i
[02:43:36.270 --> 02:43:41.150]  like having a little bit of the bud of the flower and the root and you take that and you boil it
[02:43:41.150 --> 02:43:45.630]  down but you knew your peppers we're going to knock those out like your ghost peppers your
[02:43:45.630 --> 02:43:51.790]  cayenne is really good um and i believe the bay laurel the bay laurel is so freaking strong
[02:43:51.790 --> 02:43:56.910]  um it'll definitely kill them and what you would just do is you create the protocol because you
[02:43:56.910 --> 02:44:02.670]  know that they you you have to learn the life cycle of your bug and then you know and what's
[02:44:02.670 --> 02:44:07.790]  nice about the jadam herbal solution is that you can actually do that up to three times a day and
[02:44:07.790 --> 02:44:12.670]  it's not going to like burn your plant and so you can do that especially that first day you see them
[02:44:12.670 --> 02:44:16.910]  and then you can do it like once the next day and kind of do that up to like your 10 days
[02:44:16.910 --> 02:44:20.270]  you know whatever your protocol that you decide is and it'll knock them out
[02:44:21.390 --> 02:44:27.150]  i've definitely had great results like of all the stuff i've done that has been like one of the best
[02:44:27.150 --> 02:44:33.470]  for knocking out bugs and i usually get bugs only when i wasn't paying attention you know or like
[02:44:33.470 --> 02:44:39.230]  something in the greenhouse during the winter when you know it's off balance and so and then like
[02:44:39.230 --> 02:44:44.110]  stuff gets really big and i've definitely found you know some bugs at the top and that's when i'll
[02:44:44.110 --> 02:44:50.030]  bring in the herbal solutions but a lot of times i just do my whole balance of the gardens and i
[02:44:50.030 --> 02:44:57.310]  don't really have too many bug issues but i think the jerusalem artichoke the ghost pepper the cayenne
[02:44:57.310 --> 02:45:05.070]  and the bay laurels would really be great for the red for the russet mice and but also but making
[02:45:05.070 --> 02:45:09.710]  sure you put that soap in there too because you can have that solution and it's good but that
[02:45:09.710 --> 02:45:15.390]  soap really coats it and it's like we do in the jadam stuff is use the jadam wetting agent where
[02:45:15.390 --> 02:45:20.830]  you make your own soap with oil and you can actually infuse the herb into the oil first
[02:45:20.830 --> 02:45:26.750]  and you make this like very um slippery kind of soap to be able to spray on and so that's when
[02:45:26.750 --> 02:45:33.550]  the magic happens is when you have that soap and that herbal solution yeah basically sticks it's
[02:45:33.550 --> 02:45:40.910]  why they use soap and napalm so it sticks on really good advice gold nugget yeah
[02:45:41.150 --> 02:45:47.070]  yeah you're definitely um a world of knowledge no wonder you and joey uh chop it up on a variety
[02:45:47.070 --> 02:45:52.910]  of things i'm sure is he still sitting there by no he went i think he's doing hash right now we
[02:45:52.910 --> 02:45:57.870]  just did i showed him how to do hash the other day and so he's all right now he's fucking loving it
[02:45:58.510 --> 02:46:01.870]  so yeah i think he's down doing a run right now
[02:46:03.790 --> 02:46:06.990]  yeah it'd be fun to be sitting around your dinner table at night right brian
[02:46:07.310 --> 02:46:12.510]  yeah we're total fire nerds like behind me is like books like stacked up from both of us i
[02:46:12.510 --> 02:46:17.390]  can't see them and like both of our stacks of books that we're like continuously reading and
[02:46:17.390 --> 02:46:21.950]  that's all we talk about is all this stuff you know this is like our life and i always think
[02:46:21.950 --> 02:46:26.670]  about what's the next and that's why i'm excited to do the demonstration gardens at our place
[02:46:26.670 --> 02:46:30.350]  because a lot of these fun permaculture techniques that we've been learning about
[02:46:30.910 --> 02:46:34.830]  i'm going to be able to do that and i'm going to be able to do that and i'm going to be able to
[02:46:34.830 --> 02:46:39.790]  learn about i'm going to be able to demonstrate and i really want to be able to show that and
[02:46:39.790 --> 02:46:45.070]  show it really working to inspire and encourage other people to do the same especially out here
[02:46:45.070 --> 02:46:52.670]  in california where our water you know we've had hardly any rain this year and i want to create my
[02:46:52.670 --> 02:47:00.830]  land to be water rich and so i've taken i really love the guy in africa i forgot the water harvesting
[02:47:01.390 --> 02:47:08.430]  the water i love him and so i want to go there at some point and so but that really inspired me when
[02:47:08.430 --> 02:47:13.150]  i heard that years ago and so i love going out in the rains and kind of looking where my water's
[02:47:13.150 --> 02:47:18.590]  going so we're putting in a lot of swells this year and um gonna have some fun playing with all
[02:47:18.590 --> 02:47:23.870]  that and building pupils around it and seeing what we can create in this like desert environment
[02:47:24.670 --> 02:47:32.990]  so it's fun yeah i think i think if you search um water harvesting in africa the guy we've done a
[02:47:32.990 --> 02:47:38.990]  couple really cool videos some talks and i talk about this a lot and how everybody should do it
[02:47:38.990 --> 02:47:44.030]  i don't care how much rain you're getting if you're slowing it you're preventing a word or
[02:47:44.030 --> 02:47:49.150]  erosion and you're storing it in your soil you're going to have better luck with whatever you're
[02:47:49.150 --> 02:47:55.230]  growing so great a great resource for you guys yeah
[02:48:09.180 --> 02:48:13.740]  so i noticed that you're using biochar you know some people kind of poo poo that i guess maybe
[02:48:13.740 --> 02:48:20.140]  because you know a lot of people use so much of it um but do you mind like kind of explaining why
[02:48:20.140 --> 02:48:27.100]  you personally use it um for more microbials i mean that's really it and i've got so much wood
[02:48:27.100 --> 02:48:33.660]  around me it's another great way to utilize all the wood i have and um we put a lot of like
[02:48:33.660 --> 02:48:39.260]  intention into ours if you saw our biochar pit um we kind of like we did a little like ritual
[02:48:39.260 --> 02:48:44.380]  and words and kind of have like a little prayer around it as we're doing it and then we soak all
[02:48:44.380 --> 02:48:49.020]  of that biochar that we make into one of the fermented teas and then that's all the little
[02:48:49.020 --> 02:48:52.780]  microbes have like you know they have little homes and stuff to go into and that little that
[02:48:52.780 --> 02:48:57.660]  biochar that's super porous and then putting that into the garden and i don't do it very often we
[02:48:57.660 --> 02:49:04.060]  might do it once a year you know and it's just another you know tool in your toolbox i think
[02:49:04.060 --> 02:49:09.500]  that's really great and can be beneficial especially for places that you know you have a
[02:49:09.500 --> 02:49:15.100]  lot of wood and you have a lot of down trees and you know just needing more microbials if it's more
[02:49:15.100 --> 02:49:21.660]  desert landscape like mine that's one reason we use it and uh but yeah for me i like taking i'm
[02:49:21.660 --> 02:49:25.660]  very eclectic with the way i farm and the way i do everything and so i take from all kinds of
[02:49:25.660 --> 02:49:31.500]  subjects i'm a biodynamic farmer i do jajam k and f i do a lot of different permaculture techniques
[02:49:31.500 --> 02:49:35.980]  you name it like i'll take a lot from elaine ingram i take a lot from you know just different
[02:49:35.980 --> 02:49:43.020]  sources wherever i can learn um forever student so biochar is awesome i love it you know for my
[02:49:43.100 --> 02:49:48.300]  purposes i really appreciate you tomorrow saying that and naming a variety of different people
[02:49:48.300 --> 02:49:53.100]  because layton and i i feel like sometimes some of these guys are pigeonholed and ladies are
[02:49:53.100 --> 02:49:58.060]  pigeonholed into their belief system and anytime we bring on somebody that doesn't resonate with
[02:49:58.060 --> 02:50:02.380]  their belief system it's just bullshit to them and that's the part i don't really understand
[02:50:02.380 --> 02:50:06.380]  is we're supposed to all be learning here and i feel like you can learn from a variety of people
[02:50:07.660 --> 02:50:12.140]  so i really appreciate you saying that part of things because i i think if you're going to
[02:50:12.220 --> 02:50:19.020]  cultivate cannabis on a commercial level you need the the whole gamut of of a tool set to be able to
[02:50:19.020 --> 02:50:22.460]  combat a lot of those especially when it pest issues at the commercial level like you had
[02:50:22.460 --> 02:50:27.660]  mentioned get maybe getting a little sloppy or um you know having other things where you miss a
[02:50:27.660 --> 02:50:31.660]  pocket that all of a sudden now you got russet mites or layton and i have talked about too when
[02:50:31.660 --> 02:50:36.220]  your team's out of whack and everybody's like friction and that kind of stuff you know the the
[02:50:36.220 --> 02:50:39.500]  team's kind of just probably going through the motions they're not paying attention there's a
[02:50:39.500 --> 02:50:44.540]  bunch of issues through that so i feel like uh we were able to go a little more metaphysical today
[02:50:44.540 --> 02:50:49.740]  where i hope that other people see and maybe you know research yourself on the ley lines and that
[02:50:49.740 --> 02:50:56.540]  kind of stuff see see what people were doing way before the um electronics the internet i still
[02:50:56.540 --> 02:51:01.660]  feel like they understood energy on a whole nother level i know i uh for a while was studying this
[02:51:01.660 --> 02:51:07.500]  tribe i think it's called the the dogon tribe and for for however they were able to do that they knew
[02:51:07.500 --> 02:51:14.780]  about the star serious um you know before anybody really basically so i encourage people that always
[02:51:14.780 --> 02:51:20.140]  kind of dismiss this stuff maybe to research and look for yourselves on it seems like the ancients
[02:51:20.140 --> 02:51:25.420]  knew way more uh we we make fun of them for a variety of things but i feel like they they were
[02:51:25.420 --> 02:51:32.780]  definitely tapped into something um or like have you ever heard that dude edgar casey yeah so i
[02:51:32.780 --> 02:51:38.940]  mean how do you explain that yeah yeah you know i'd love to just speak real quick on that too
[02:51:38.940 --> 02:51:44.300]  tomorrow thank you for bringing that up and and that is a bone of contention with a lot of people
[02:51:44.300 --> 02:51:48.940]  that you know they're they're afraid to step outside the box and you know you can take what
[02:51:48.940 --> 02:51:54.140]  you want from different people you don't have to take it all you don't have to buy a hook line and
[02:51:54.140 --> 02:52:00.060]  sinker but every single type and method and technique has some true gold nuggets in it
[02:52:00.060 --> 02:52:05.100]  it's just a matter of you understanding enough of it to be able to utilize those things instead
[02:52:05.100 --> 02:52:12.220]  of pooping it and and on the ancients brian they discovered a device that is so complicated in its
[02:52:12.220 --> 02:52:19.660]  mechanics um used to navigate stars uh it's this little golden box that they found buried in the
[02:52:19.660 --> 02:52:26.220]  coral coral off of i believe it was greece um that i occasionally see pop up in my feeds but
[02:52:26.220 --> 02:52:31.980]  they're like we we can't we couldn't even make this today uh how intricate it was and and so it
[02:52:31.980 --> 02:52:39.500]  was there there was a lot of shit that got lost and remember the victor of the war always wiped
[02:52:39.500 --> 02:52:44.140]  out all of the technology and the and the knowledge of the of the past because again
[02:52:44.940 --> 02:52:51.820]  power is created by lack of knowledge i have power over you if you know nothing because you need me
[02:52:51.900 --> 02:52:57.660]  so that was that was the theory and then we've destroyed our relationship with plants and herbs
[02:52:57.660 --> 02:53:05.180]  that that tribes thousands of thousands of years ago were using on a daily basis so you know keep
[02:53:05.180 --> 02:53:09.740]  an open mind and tomorrow again thank you so much for bringing that up again you know hit that home
[02:53:09.740 --> 02:53:14.620]  to people you don't have to follow one leader there's there's so much information out there
[02:53:15.260 --> 02:53:19.660]  well let's you shouldn't follow one leader you know if you're this full line and sinker that's
[02:53:19.660 --> 02:53:23.180]  called a cult and you better get the hell out of that because i feel like some of these people
[02:53:24.460 --> 02:53:31.580]  you guys the way you talk is borderline cultish and i'll say that to you lovingly i hope but yeah
[02:53:31.580 --> 02:53:36.060]  let's learn from a variety of people let's not just be like yo this is the only way i farm
[02:53:36.060 --> 02:53:40.860]  okay but that's your personal belief system uh there's a lot of things out there for us to learn
[02:53:40.860 --> 02:53:47.180]  and uh tomorrow you're living proof of what it really takes to to farm at an elite level um and
[02:53:47.180 --> 02:53:51.340]  the fact like clayton said two of you are sitting there at the table i can't imagine
[02:53:51.900 --> 02:53:57.500]  uh all the uh you know the the mistakes that are minimized between the two of you by just sitting
[02:53:57.500 --> 02:54:03.580]  there and chopping it up and i love the camps you guys are doing man i just it's it's such a
[02:54:03.580 --> 02:54:10.220]  bummer this covid bullshit um has affected our ability to travel and gather you know joey's
[02:54:10.220 --> 02:54:17.820]  been working on those for for what two years now and and then it just coveted um yeah 20 because i
[02:54:17.820 --> 02:54:21.580]  was getting ready to do a microscope class and i know chris trump was coming up there
[02:54:22.380 --> 02:54:27.420]  you know it's an amazing resource and i i texted him the other day and i i asked him i hope that
[02:54:27.420 --> 02:54:33.980]  that guy purchased it um that was thinking about buying that facility because it needs
[02:54:33.980 --> 02:54:37.900]  it needs to be able to be open back up again it's just such a magical place
[02:54:40.220 --> 02:54:46.060]  yeah real quick to joey how cool is it to have a girl that smokes blunts and drinks chocolate milk
[02:54:49.180 --> 02:54:54.380]  and has a badass knowledge that's what i'm talking about i was sitting there with the blunt
[02:54:54.380 --> 02:55:01.900]  drinking his chocolate milk that was my raw cacao um also sprouted um seed milk too by the way
[02:55:03.180 --> 02:55:05.980]  oh i'm sure it was yeah i'm sure it wasn't like mess quick
[02:55:06.140 --> 02:55:15.340]  i don't know oh god yeah this was great uh peter if there's questions um you know let's let's fire
[02:55:15.340 --> 02:55:20.620]  away i think um you know one of the main things that i i just appreciate is that you you know
[02:55:20.620 --> 02:55:24.860]  you're coming on here and you're just telling it like it is and i feel like a lot of those
[02:55:24.860 --> 02:55:28.620]  especially some of even the guests i've i personally have tried to like pull a little
[02:55:28.620 --> 02:55:32.620]  more out of them and i don't feel like they want to go that way or sometimes even the metaphysical
[02:55:32.620 --> 02:55:37.740]  way just i understand it because this shit is forever right what we just did is forever and
[02:55:37.740 --> 02:55:42.700]  some people don't want to speak on those kind of things but um i feel like if you take the time to
[02:55:42.700 --> 02:55:48.140]  research there that has to be a rabbit hole that you you're either going to choose to go down or
[02:55:48.140 --> 02:55:55.820]  choose not to but i feel like there's a reason why the elite of the elite uh really understand energy
[02:55:56.220 --> 02:56:02.940]  um and there's a whole weirdness to um like if you really want to get i guess if you want to
[02:56:02.940 --> 02:56:07.980]  see both sides there's this dude named alexester crawley and if you research that motherfucker i
[02:56:07.980 --> 02:56:13.660]  assure you it's going to be very eye-opening to you um a variety of different things in life i
[02:56:13.660 --> 02:56:18.700]  mean that's a rabbit hole in general there's um music that's generated um to that gentleman and
[02:56:18.700 --> 02:56:26.300]  stuff like that so uh energy is real in my book on both sides well remember everything is waves
[02:56:27.420 --> 02:56:35.180]  vibration which is music light which is vibration everything is vibration the earth vibrates at a
[02:56:35.180 --> 02:56:42.940]  certain level i think um it's 3.18 i don't remember to be honest with you and we tune our guitars to
[02:56:42.940 --> 02:56:49.420]  3.2 something if i'm correct i'm sure someone in the chat will remember um and i think peter's
[02:56:49.420 --> 02:56:53.980]  getting his butt handed to him by his wife because he ate the wrong pastrami sandwich so that's why
[02:56:53.980 --> 02:57:01.980]  he isn't that's why he isn't on any man that has three kids that was my brother that i already
[02:57:01.980 --> 02:57:09.820]  got yelled at uh evidently i was supposed to know the brown paper bag that said pastrami on it had
[02:57:10.780 --> 02:57:15.980]  there were two of them and one had all the delicious goodness on it which is the one i
[02:57:15.980 --> 02:57:21.340]  wanted and i grabbed the dry plain one which is uh what she wanted so
[02:57:24.220 --> 02:57:27.500]  anyway well hopefully there'll be some peace under the roof when you get done
[02:57:28.380 --> 02:57:35.020]  yes hope you warfare so anyway on were there any questions out there audience that you'd like to
[02:57:35.020 --> 02:57:41.900]  ask her um we're rolling i just had a quick uh i i had from the very beginning queued up um
[02:57:47.140 --> 02:57:50.100]  this and was hoping you can maybe just walk through the
[02:57:51.060 --> 02:57:53.700]  kind of elaborate on the permaculture principles
[02:57:57.700 --> 02:58:05.940]  yeah all right so we've got observe and um what is this one let me look at these
[02:58:06.660 --> 02:58:12.740]  observe and interact that's just like observing your environment and like how everything like
[02:58:12.740 --> 02:58:18.100]  really interacts with each other that's i know that joey can speak a lot more onto this but i'm
[02:58:18.100 --> 02:58:23.140]  more lay in my terms and how i just like see things so that's how i'm going to speak so for
[02:58:23.140 --> 02:58:28.500]  me like when i went to my property i like sat and you need to like it's really good to observe a
[02:58:28.500 --> 02:58:33.140]  place if you have the ability to observe a place for a year without really building or doing your
[02:58:33.140 --> 02:58:39.380]  design you have so much more to work with because you can see how your winds go you can see where
[02:58:39.380 --> 02:58:45.380]  your sun is at you can see how the rain comes down off your heelsides and where it pools and
[02:58:45.380 --> 02:58:50.900]  it's really in seeing how your wildlife interacts with all that seeing the small nuances that
[02:58:50.900 --> 02:58:57.220]  really create where you're living or where you're wanting to design and the catch in your storing
[02:58:57.940 --> 02:59:04.260]  and that's by observing you're able to see where you're able to collect those energy sources but
[02:59:04.260 --> 02:59:10.820]  then another really cool way is like even just your canopy of your plants you're able to catch
[02:59:10.820 --> 02:59:16.900]  sunlight in different ways like my cannabis will catch it during this time and then underneath i
[02:59:16.900 --> 02:59:21.860]  have some herbs that are maybe more sensitive to that and so it's like you're able to catch it all
[02:59:21.860 --> 02:59:26.740]  the way down to the ground if you have these different layers and different levels of canopy
[02:59:27.300 --> 02:59:32.340]  and you're able to store it you know within and also the whole thing i feel like with water is
[02:59:32.340 --> 02:59:38.420]  being able to catch that water and store it so it's finding you know those different systems that's
[02:59:38.420 --> 02:59:44.100]  why i love permaculture it's all about these systems and obtain yield and that's you know
[02:59:44.100 --> 02:59:50.420]  let's it's obtaining your yield increasing that and like i feel like by really paying attention
[02:59:51.140 --> 02:59:56.020]  you're able to yield more than if you just go in and be like okay i'm gonna do this and i'm just
[02:59:56.020 --> 03:00:01.060]  gonna flatten this land and you know i'm gonna take these trees out i'm gonna get this much yield
[03:00:01.060 --> 03:00:06.420]  per but oh if you really like slow down and you pay attention how nature works you can be way
[03:00:06.420 --> 03:00:12.180]  more in harmonious with that and obtain your yields more and being able to have different
[03:00:12.180 --> 03:00:17.620]  yields because you're having different sources of income or different kind of plants and things
[03:00:17.620 --> 03:00:22.420]  available um let me go back to that slide so i can see
[03:00:25.220 --> 03:00:27.700]  going through again um
[03:00:29.780 --> 03:00:36.740]  apply self-regulation yeah and that's that's the whole thing it's like apply your self-regulation
[03:00:36.740 --> 03:00:42.580]  maybe instead of doing like an acre or five acres or like people out here in lake county are trying
[03:00:42.580 --> 03:00:50.980]  to do 134 fucking acres of cannabis you can apply self-regulation on yourself go also like
[03:00:50.980 --> 03:00:55.540]  what kind of lifestyle do i want to have what actually will meet my needs what will meet
[03:00:55.540 --> 03:01:01.140]  like not just you know what would be harmonious with the earth how can i be sustainable and like
[03:01:01.140 --> 03:01:06.500]  accept that feedback not only from other people but also from your environment because if your
[03:01:06.500 --> 03:01:10.900]  environment saying this isn't working because every year something's fucking up or you're
[03:01:10.900 --> 03:01:15.780]  getting pests in this one area you're getting rained out or you know something's happening then
[03:01:15.780 --> 03:01:22.020]  accept that feedback that maybe that's not the right place to um you know plant something or
[03:01:22.020 --> 03:01:25.860]  you know just kind of shift it a little bit i think your environment gives you like some of the most
[03:01:26.420 --> 03:01:37.140]  immediate feedback that there is um so what else we got we got use valuable resource
[03:01:37.140 --> 03:01:45.460]  renewable energy and resources yeah so renewable energy and resources is like what is renewable
[03:01:45.460 --> 03:01:50.340]  what can be redone over and over and over again and like what are your resources that you have
[03:01:50.340 --> 03:01:58.020]  available because if you're buying stuff um from that's being mined out of the earth is that
[03:01:58.020 --> 03:02:02.900]  renewable no not over years and years or maybe millions of years your minerals coming out of
[03:02:02.900 --> 03:02:08.660]  the earth you know but if you're finding resources on your land to use or you're building your soil
[03:02:08.660 --> 03:02:13.620]  your your manures are a huge one you know bringing in animals into a farm really helps
[03:02:14.500 --> 03:02:20.580]  have renewable resources and like for us i also like the whole thing of um that whole industrial
[03:02:20.580 --> 03:02:26.580]  harvesting i learned during that one um place i lived in texas where what was our renewable
[03:02:26.580 --> 03:02:32.580]  resources leaves we collected so many thousands of leaves and then we use the leaves that were in the
[03:02:32.580 --> 03:02:37.540]  black trash stick pegs to put around some of the plants in the winter time and we had fresh greens
[03:02:38.100 --> 03:02:44.020]  and um then we were able to use the wood that would come in from the different the power company
[03:02:44.020 --> 03:02:49.300]  kind of cutting those down like those aren't renewable but there's like it's being able to
[03:02:49.300 --> 03:02:54.740]  harvest what's around you and being able to reuse that over and over and just like i love the oyster
[03:02:54.740 --> 03:03:00.340]  shells we got and for me it's like really about reaching out what's local you know like yes
[03:03:00.340 --> 03:03:06.500]  definitely what's on our property but what's what's also local and how can you make a difference
[03:03:06.500 --> 03:03:11.140]  and like i think harvesting those leaves was way better than them going to the dump you know how
[03:03:11.140 --> 03:03:16.020]  can you make a better impact you know by even collecting that i don't want to hurt anything i
[03:03:16.020 --> 03:03:23.140]  want to like find ways that whatever i do it helps you know it doesn't hinder so that's kind of what
[03:03:23.140 --> 03:03:31.700]  i look at when i see that um produce no waste yeah produce no waste how can we have as little
[03:03:31.700 --> 03:03:38.820]  waste as possible the it's a really eye-open experience to go to the dump especially when
[03:03:38.820 --> 03:03:44.420]  you're dumping more garbage in there and plastic trellis netting and that is not a renewable
[03:03:44.420 --> 03:03:50.580]  resource and that shit it can't be broken down for a really long time it does not feel good
[03:03:50.660 --> 03:03:55.780]  not pretty you know there's so much waste that can be produced in commercial farming and just
[03:03:55.780 --> 03:04:01.460]  the world in general with lots of plastics and single-use things and how do we not have waste
[03:04:02.260 --> 03:04:08.820]  and that's a really deep question actually to ask and the more every year we get to where we're not
[03:04:08.820 --> 03:04:13.700]  producing waste because we're making our own teas now i have the jute netting and like that just
[03:04:13.700 --> 03:04:20.020]  gets composted back into the soil if it needs to be we use as much glass as possible you know just
[03:04:20.020 --> 03:04:23.540]  trying to get away from a lot of plastics but it's kind of hard in this day and age
[03:04:24.340 --> 03:04:29.140]  um but another thing too like i'm really big into trash trash is a thing that i've really thought
[03:04:29.140 --> 03:04:34.500]  about a lot and so another way that we're looking at doing our trash is we've created a whole trash
[03:04:34.500 --> 03:04:39.700]  center where we um collect and store different parts i have one that i'm trying to create a
[03:04:39.700 --> 03:04:44.260]  compost pile with like the little pieces of plastic you can't compo i mean you can't like
[03:04:44.260 --> 03:04:50.260]  recycle like the green tape we used to use little pieces of the plastic netting that you just find
[03:04:50.260 --> 03:04:57.060]  laying around still even though you've cleaned it all up um any of the uh hay bales the hay bale
[03:04:57.060 --> 03:05:02.420]  string the tarps you know the tarps just disintegrate so all that shit i've collected
[03:05:02.420 --> 03:05:08.420]  now and i'm trying not to use a lot of that stuff but i create a compost pile that i i put soil and
[03:05:08.420 --> 03:05:12.900]  straw and everything else in i'm gonna inoculate with mushrooms so i'm gonna try to figure out how
[03:05:12.900 --> 03:05:19.140]  we can have like you know re you know just be able to knock down that plastic and then the rest of
[03:05:19.140 --> 03:05:25.780]  the trash some of the trash we um collect and are putting in big bags and we're going to use as some
[03:05:25.780 --> 03:05:31.300]  of our insulation for some of the structures we have going on the property so you know let's just
[03:05:31.300 --> 03:05:35.540]  get creative that's really what seeing these principles are about you know here's some really
[03:05:35.540 --> 03:05:40.820]  good principles to live by and how you perceive each of those is you know take that to that level
[03:05:40.820 --> 03:05:51.060]  is the is the fun part so it's the next one let's see um uh design from patterns to details
[03:05:52.180 --> 03:06:01.780]  okay design from patterns to details i don't know about that one except it's basically sacred
[03:06:01.780 --> 03:06:09.300]  geometry okay okay again you're looking at patterns grid patterns natural patterns reoccurrences
[03:06:09.300 --> 03:06:12.660]  and then use that as your design footing or your foundation
[03:06:16.420 --> 03:06:22.340]  i like that that's yeah definitely definitely kind of look from nature to see how nature does it
[03:06:22.340 --> 03:06:30.820]  and get onto the details integrate rather than segregate yeah like how do you integrate all the
[03:06:30.820 --> 03:06:35.780]  native plants that are around you then segregating it that's one really fun thing i like we like to do
[03:06:35.860 --> 03:06:41.540]  too and um it's like making sure we have some native plants within this garden that we're
[03:06:41.540 --> 03:06:46.340]  cultivating so you have your native bug species that they have like their banker plants i love
[03:06:46.340 --> 03:06:55.300]  using a lot of like native species integrated into my gardens so the natural predators can live there
[03:06:55.300 --> 03:07:00.660]  and and then just like how do you integrate the landscape you have you know into your garden for
[03:07:00.660 --> 03:07:06.740]  us we have lots of rocks we have so many fucking rocks that we've started integrating that into all
[03:07:06.740 --> 03:07:12.500]  of the building and you know of all the gardens and stuff and utilizing that as a really beautiful
[03:07:12.500 --> 03:07:18.180]  resource to beautify things as well and hold stability i think it's just like how to work
[03:07:18.180 --> 03:07:23.220]  with what you have instead of like going against you know and so that's a lot of it's like how to
[03:07:23.220 --> 03:07:28.100]  flow how they integrate instead of work against and try to clear out like how do you work with
[03:07:28.100 --> 03:07:32.420]  this tree that's in the middle here you know do you need to get rid of it or can you use it and
[03:07:32.420 --> 03:07:44.140]  grow like some more um shade loving plants underneath it so um use small and slow solutions
[03:07:44.700 --> 03:07:50.460]  oh yeah use small and slow solutions that's when i've had to to work one of the principles
[03:07:50.460 --> 03:07:59.420]  permaculture is start slow start small and expand and for me i kind of start big and i go feet first
[03:08:00.460 --> 03:08:07.020]  it's been a really beautiful permaculture thing to integrate into myself is learning how to start
[03:08:07.020 --> 03:08:12.700]  smaller and being able to see your system and if it's working and then expand upon that and then
[03:08:12.700 --> 03:08:17.420]  is this working oh maybe not let's just ship this a little bit and then maybe keep expanding
[03:08:17.420 --> 03:08:24.220]  instead of what i've done is have to redo everything and start over again and so if we can
[03:08:24.220 --> 03:08:30.540]  start small then um we can expand out and you're actually able to see your environment and how
[03:08:30.540 --> 03:08:38.380]  things are working better the old saying low and slow right yeah and also when you when you do it
[03:08:38.380 --> 03:08:43.660]  that way if you do make a mistake it's not a huge mistake it's just a little mistake that's very
[03:08:45.180 --> 03:08:53.980]  great principle use and value diversity ah yeah that's a good one i love that i use diversity
[03:08:54.060 --> 03:08:59.180]  in everything i mean because go look in the forest what's going on there is there the same plant
[03:08:59.180 --> 03:09:03.740]  everywhere is there's the same three plants you can't even figure out all the different plants
[03:09:03.740 --> 03:09:08.700]  there's sometimes just so many right there there's so much diversity making up that forest floor
[03:09:09.340 --> 03:09:14.700]  and and the different canopies from it and that's how nature does it and i feel like that's the way
[03:09:14.700 --> 03:09:19.740]  we should do it because that's how it's done for all time and how she you know how she wants it
[03:09:19.740 --> 03:09:26.380]  done so diversity is just so key and being able to maintain a good balance in your ecosystem
[03:09:26.380 --> 03:09:31.740]  because there's so many parts of that diversity that you're not even realizing is working between
[03:09:31.740 --> 03:09:37.980]  having your birds be there that bird song helping your plants actually grow to the minute life going
[03:09:37.980 --> 03:09:42.940]  on down deep within your soils the roots connecting your mycelium everything's talking
[03:09:42.940 --> 03:09:48.700]  and so that diversity is just so powerful for the health of your soil and like the whole
[03:09:48.700 --> 03:09:54.380]  ecosystem and i think that's within ourselves too we don't all want to be alike we want so
[03:09:54.380 --> 03:09:59.980]  much diversity you know and diversity in life i think that's the key to everything is a lot
[03:09:59.980 --> 03:10:05.660]  of diversity so that's the key to health anything i've learned during the past year and a half it's
[03:10:05.660 --> 03:10:12.620]  that everybody loves different opinions on covid and on donald trump and joe biden and
[03:10:13.180 --> 03:10:20.060]  everybody embraces alternative perspectives yeah we're all living in these sarcastic
[03:10:20.860 --> 03:10:26.860]  but it's true it is diversity and it's like if there we all thought the same it wouldn't be fun
[03:10:26.860 --> 03:10:31.580]  you know we wouldn't have anyone to argue with there wouldn't be all these different conflicting
[03:10:31.580 --> 03:10:37.580]  things but then it wouldn't be unique until each experience and yeah i think diversity is beautiful
[03:10:37.980 --> 03:10:47.740]  okay so the next one is use edges and value the marginal oh yeah the edges edges are awesome
[03:10:49.100 --> 03:10:53.340]  there's several different ways you can like perceive edges like there's the edges of the
[03:10:53.340 --> 03:10:58.060]  forest you know as a forest ends and then like the meadow or something begins you know you can
[03:10:58.060 --> 03:11:03.580]  use that edge because that edge is also going to have a lot of life sitting there you have a lot of
[03:11:04.540 --> 03:11:10.380]  bug diversity you know and ecological life just because you have your shade going to your sun
[03:11:10.380 --> 03:11:15.340]  and so you're able to if you're able to incorporate some of those corners into your garden like i i
[03:11:15.340 --> 03:11:20.380]  have some trees that are right beside my goddess garden and i like having just that right there and
[03:11:20.380 --> 03:11:26.220]  i keep it all native all the native plants underneath where the tree is going into the garden
[03:11:26.860 --> 03:11:33.580]  um and i don't take anything down and but then also i look at my edges around the garden too
[03:11:33.580 --> 03:11:39.980]  and i utilize all those edges for different plant species because i edge i love edging my gardens
[03:11:39.980 --> 03:11:46.300]  with um like the lemon balm the lavender the rosemary some of these drier plants that are also
[03:11:46.940 --> 03:11:51.420]  like the volatile oils the smelly plants like i have to call them white sage anything that
[03:11:51.980 --> 03:11:59.340]  um doesn't need as much water but then also has um a lot of that's volatile oils to it because
[03:11:59.340 --> 03:12:06.220]  it's like a pest deterrent so that's one thing i love to edge my gardens with um but then i mean
[03:12:06.220 --> 03:12:11.180]  there's so much about the edges that you can be able to utilize and when you really look at the
[03:12:11.180 --> 03:12:18.300]  environments you have and being able to utilize the shade versus the direct sun and the different
[03:12:18.300 --> 03:12:24.140]  life that's there so i like to think of the edges as the gray line in between the yin and the yang
[03:12:24.780 --> 03:12:26.460]  and that's the best place to start
[03:12:30.940 --> 03:12:38.060]  i like that okay the very last one creatively use and respond to change
[03:12:39.660 --> 03:12:45.660]  yeah i think that's that's a good thing to see in our all our lives is to creatively use what
[03:12:45.740 --> 03:12:53.020]  you've got and to creatively you know use your resources and um what did that say exactly
[03:12:53.020 --> 03:12:57.260]  creatively use and uh
[03:13:00.380 --> 03:13:06.380]  just lost track of my thought and respond to change okay and so you're responding to that
[03:13:06.380 --> 03:13:11.740]  change for like okay let's just say as humans we need to be able to creatively respond to what's
[03:13:11.740 --> 03:13:18.140]  going on in this crazy pandemic times like if we're not able to respond um and like you know
[03:13:18.140 --> 03:13:22.620]  automatically and we're caught up in these belief systems i feel like that can really hinder us
[03:13:22.620 --> 03:13:28.380]  moving forward but if we're creatively able to use even this right now going oh my god everything's
[03:13:28.380 --> 03:13:33.020]  shut down how am i going to work okay well what can i create what do i need to create like for us
[03:13:33.020 --> 03:13:38.300]  we started creating like a ton of antivirals and we created this whole like line of products and
[03:13:38.380 --> 03:13:43.420]  switched really fast so that we could still have income and still help you know and so that was
[03:13:43.420 --> 03:13:48.300]  one of our ways i really love in our business we're able to creatively like respond to change
[03:13:48.300 --> 03:13:53.420]  like immediately because there's so many different um things that we can create and do with the herbs
[03:13:53.420 --> 03:13:58.940]  and things we have but the same thing in your land like you need to be able to see oh my god there's
[03:13:58.940 --> 03:14:03.900]  like a creek running through this area or something's happened like how can you creatively
[03:14:03.900 --> 03:14:11.740]  use this fallen tree that fell down and that's fucking huge and be able to utilize it into the
[03:14:11.740 --> 03:14:17.500]  landscape or how can we make this beneficial to us and like having to respond to that change where
[03:14:17.500 --> 03:14:22.540]  it's there now that is one thing that just happened to us this year and we've gone really
[03:14:22.540 --> 03:14:28.860]  creative with this giant tree in fact we're actually creating a couple of um thrones with
[03:14:28.860 --> 03:14:35.020]  the big wood out of it but everything else went into hugels we ended up um just doing lots of
[03:14:35.020 --> 03:14:40.140]  different projects with it and it was really fun including collecting some of the pine needles
[03:14:40.780 --> 03:14:45.420]  and and so like for us that's that was like a huge one it's just getting really creative and
[03:14:45.420 --> 03:14:51.420]  responding to what's changing changing environment like we have a completely different environment
[03:14:51.420 --> 03:14:56.060]  shifting out there it was a lot wetter a few years ago and now every year it's just getting a little
[03:14:56.060 --> 03:15:01.820]  drier and we're having having to respond to that change by remembering how i grew in the desert
[03:15:01.820 --> 03:15:07.500]  and so that is you know and the hugels that we created and kind of creatively being able to
[03:15:07.500 --> 03:15:15.420]  you know utilize what you have and respond to that change so yeah love those principles
[03:15:15.580 --> 03:15:22.780]  i had to yeah very well defined yeah so adopted into any circumstance you know
[03:15:24.140 --> 03:15:30.300]  i got the real power of them so peter were there any other questions the hard-hitting questions
[03:15:30.300 --> 03:15:38.220]  uh what are you smoking and uh what what do you like to grow and why okay looking for in your
[03:15:38.220 --> 03:15:49.260]  cultivars um my i love growing different um like different various ratios of cbds and the different
[03:15:49.260 --> 03:15:57.260]  thgs and so i was just smoking on a one-to-one that me and joey created together the citrine og
[03:15:57.820 --> 03:16:04.860]  in the ringo's gift and um that was like a tahoe diamond og crossed with african orange and then
[03:16:04.860 --> 03:16:11.980]  that was crossed with a ringo's gift and so i've created a lot of different strains with the ringos
[03:16:11.980 --> 03:16:18.060]  and now starting with the love laughter and some harley sue but i love the different ratios of cbd
[03:16:18.060 --> 03:16:24.300]  and thc and also some of the hemp i've just been doing and it's getting really high ratios of cbg
[03:16:24.300 --> 03:16:28.860]  so those are some of my most fun things to play with and what i get really excited about i've got
[03:16:28.860 --> 03:16:35.180]  like two to ones i've got some high thc with like one or two you know cbd and they're two ratio two
[03:16:35.180 --> 03:16:40.620]  percent and two all the way to you know high cbds with just a little thc to like that mixture in
[03:16:40.620 --> 03:16:47.900]  between um and so those are really fun for me and i really like finding terpenes different terpene
[03:16:47.900 --> 03:16:53.420]  mixes you know like linalool and lemonade i use a lot of for helping it like there's a lot of people
[03:16:53.420 --> 03:16:58.860]  with anxiety like that's a huge thing in our society is anxiety and linalool is a really
[03:16:58.860 --> 03:17:05.180]  powerful terpene that can help with that and um so that's been one of my things i try to grow for
[03:17:05.180 --> 03:17:11.340]  and i'm always searching really high linalool strains and lavender and there's purples and
[03:17:11.340 --> 03:17:17.900]  those indica's that really give you that relaxing feeling without like that paranoia and so it's
[03:17:17.900 --> 03:17:23.500]  kind of a mission i have and growing a lot of strains is just really getting those medicinal
[03:17:23.500 --> 03:17:29.820]  benefits in there there was a you mentioned hemp so there was a question about growing hemp and
[03:17:29.820 --> 03:17:35.340]  high thc on the same property his question was or his or her question was from a
[03:17:36.220 --> 03:17:41.340]  regulatory standpoint but also my question would be kind of from a pollen drift standpoint
[03:17:41.500 --> 03:17:47.980]  um from a regulatory standpoint i can't do that on my property and that's why i'm going to
[03:17:47.980 --> 03:17:52.620]  eventually have you know one of my properties be hemp and then the other with the cannabis
[03:17:53.420 --> 03:17:58.540]  and so that is just because they're regulatory but if it wasn't dealing with that i would try
[03:17:58.540 --> 03:18:05.340]  to put them on the same one and i mean there is a um you will have a drift in pollen if you're not
[03:18:05.900 --> 03:18:12.300]  regulating your males but my thing would be to regulate those males and to make sure i'm like
[03:18:12.300 --> 03:18:18.620]  walking the fields and i'd probably get everything tested because but i'm not also doing like 10
[03:18:18.620 --> 03:18:25.100]  acres of hemp i'm only doing like small portions of what i can do and what i can produce and what
[03:18:25.100 --> 03:18:31.820]  i can use for my products so yeah it's not really too much of an issue that i found for ourselves as
[03:18:31.820 --> 03:18:39.020]  we're doing it there was a question on uh kind of chop and drop or just you know instead of
[03:18:39.020 --> 03:18:45.980]  composting maybe just leaving the fan leaves and other stuff on in the area on the ground i do i
[03:18:45.980 --> 03:18:52.380]  definitely do i i when i just pruned all my plants i put that i just put directly onto the soil
[03:18:52.940 --> 03:18:58.620]  and less when i was pruning i saw a bunch that had some flowers beginning i'd make a tea with that
[03:18:58.620 --> 03:19:04.860]  but when i'm pruning everything goes back into the soil and then i um put straw on top of that
[03:19:04.860 --> 03:19:09.580]  and then i'll do like a tea and that way everything's breaking down with that microbial
[03:19:09.580 --> 03:19:18.500]  solution but i love just dropping my leaves directly onto the soil thank you answer that
[03:19:19.380 --> 03:19:26.260]  yes i believe in adding lots of diversity constantly as much diversity as possible as
[03:19:26.260 --> 03:19:37.780]  many flowers as possible and um yeah i'm laughing at a an s bob comment this bong rips comment
[03:19:42.640 --> 03:19:49.200]  i think uh i don't know i don't see any other we we've got a good uh three hours and 20 minutes
[03:19:50.160 --> 03:19:55.440]  okay how do you feel it's 4 20 on the east coast all right
[03:19:57.440 --> 03:20:00.000]  don't worry when you get off the crash will set in
[03:20:01.360 --> 03:20:05.040]  yeah there's a good flow and then once you're done you're like oh i need a nap

[03:22:18.800 --> 03:22:24.880]  mustard i was like what can i put on this i've eaten an entire pastrami sandwich during that
[03:22:24.880 --> 03:22:35.600]  conversation um just quickly tonight we got uh a little clubhouse time uh it's that the room's
[03:22:35.600 --> 03:22:43.440]  going to open at six uh but uh to redeem myself i have to go pick up some lobster for anniversary

[03:23:40.000 --> 03:23:43.920]  uh pastrami is probably not overly healthy but it is delicious
