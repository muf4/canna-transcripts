And we are live everybody let's get her in
All right, hi everybody, my name is London those that have never seen me before this will be the first time I am the
Moderator of conversation on the Dank Hour or the regular Tuesday show as well as a couple other ones
I'm excited to be here as the content producer for this awesome show
We have for you guys a couple members of the Dank Hour and some of the Dankest heads that I know
To talk about the most fire that they have in the industry and these guys are the
Well, I'll let you get to know them yourself. All right, let's introduce them now and I'll get this and we'll get this show started
Oh
There we go
Go ahead guys. You are live and your mics are on except for you Brian
Hey, what's up? Everybody? I'm RJ. This is Brian and Jameson and we are fire is fire
This is our show that we just started just want to talk about all things fire
You know what? I mean everything glass dabs flour food
anything else so
Yeah, so I'm RJ I'm an extractor and I work with the third party lead it leading third party extraction company in Canada I
Handle ethanol co2 and butane extraction been doing this for about 15 years on the extraction side and been collecting glass
also for about 15 years, so
Just want to have a great pitch with you guys. Get lit. I'll pass this on to Jameson
Beautiful
Hey everyone, my name is Jameson well-born I
I've been in legal cannabis up here in Canada since the start of 2016
I've been involved in cannabis since 2006. I've been touching the plant and
You know over the last I don't know five or six years
I've really gotten into glass and you know met a lot of great people and these two individuals included and you know
really excited to just sort of share the knowledge that I have and
Ask questions and learn more about you know, you know, we didn't want to show that sort of restricted us to a single topic
But we wanted something that we could come on and just sort of have a casual conversation with friends
Bring bring different individuals on and just simply talk about what interests us
What what we're talking about behind the scenes anyway, and you know, we know that you know
Even this is such a close-knit community
A lot of us are spread out all over the place
And so having you know
Just sort of a weekly session where we can come together and just you know, talk about stuff we want to talk about
So it's great to meet you all and you know, super excited to
host this inaugural show with you guys
I'm Brian. I'm
710 doctor. I'm a doctor in my real life and I doctor and
I've been in cannabis. I mean more on
I've been in cannabis. I mean more on the
side before it became legal up here in Canada for years and years and years, I'm also a medical patient and
I've been
Involved in in cannabis and really the search for high-end cannabis
I think since I don't know RJ since we first met I think that's probably what brought us together
There was always you know, 20 years ago. It was all about
Are you guys all right, it wasn't mids it was like what was it you get you get a
Get hydro or you get sis
Right. So it was all about like where can we get the dankest shit?
We were always all about smoking if we're gonna smoke less let's smoke the highest quality, right?
and I think that's probably what brought RJ and I together about 20 years ago as friends and
you know down the
extraction process and
Yeah, I mean I think that's where we're dabbing in general started
I think it was a lot of people same thing with ash looking for super high quality
smoke
What do you think RJ where
Well, I mean so I started I started kind of dabbing the way that dabbing is more traditionally done now
in about
2008 I think but back then we didn't have
The dope gear that we have now right we didn't have bangers we didn't have anything we didn't have quartz, right we had
Type pads like Brian if you want to hold up your yeah, so like that's how it was swing
It was just heating up that piece of titanium swinging it under the curve and dabbing on hot titanium
That's what dabbing was
Even before that
Yeah, we were just getting like glass
Globes made like kind of similar to smoking not as fun things
As cannabis that that is one crazy looking like a thing. Can you hold that up for a little bit more there, right?
Like I've never personally myself seen something like this
Like that is just quite the mechanism and a beautiful piece of artwork
I'm gonna get in the souvenir for everybody to see that because that's really neat. Oh, what are the craziest things?
So about this is you you didn't get the true flavor of your dab unless you season the type head it tasted real
metallic real
Much much like cast-iron skillet
What exactly do you mean by season because in in culinary like we would seize it in by like salt pepper
Like it would not salt pepper, but oil
Like what would you season it?
So what you would do is you would take your your shatter or actually
I used to use the reclaim
Up and over here and just glob it on to here super hot. I mean not hit it just like I'm gonna say you didn't hit it
Little like splotch on it. Yeah. Yeah, and then it was good to dab
But it was like an hour or an hour and a half or just slathering oil on it and baking it in before you dab it
But it's it's a lot different with courts, right? I remember when people would like have to get their swings replaced
It was like one or two dudes that would do the wraps
Well first it was just one it started off with HMK
Hash master cut HMK black on Instagram and his sister G girl. She made the rigs
So it was like he designed it she made it he wrapped it and then they sold them together
until about
2010
You know, but now hold on before you go to that now I look at them and I look at like the joint here
Yo, that's janky as shit
well, yeah, but that was here that to like I
Mean, it's not really fair to compare to a mothership, but compare that to a mothership and the weld
It's also the quality of like G girl was a good glassblower
But she wasn't on the level of like Debbie or Jake see or the guys at the ship
Right, so like she did a great thing she did, you know, she created a brand out of her garage, you know
Without even a face just having HMK be the face
So that was dope and it got it got kind of the most I don't want to say
Elite but it got like the people who were on the forefront who had access over the hump to a point, right and then after that
That kind of swing arm style opened up the entire market
right, it wasn't just HMK doing it after a while it was everyone and then things went from that to like oil domes and then
Everybody made domes. Well, it was highly educated know that like did the
First listen the titanium nail and then the adjustable titanium nail you could screw
So I don't think they were the first to do the titanium nail
But the like fully brand it and get it out there. Yeah, I think the first dudes to do titanium nails were on Tok City
Which is where all of this started all this started on Tok City people don't know that
The website's now defunct Tok City comm but that's where all of this started
Like that's where the intersection of glass and dabs and
Extraction really came together. It was that like crucial
Point where like dope growers came extractors came and then glassblowers all like met at a crux
Traded knowledge traded information and then the glass lane the glass game blew up
There wasn't really a forum before that where glass could be displayed or talked about
You know, nobody talked about how dangerous it was that we were all open blasting
Yeah, but like open blasting was the norm in
2008 2010
Right
So like things have changed in 10 years a lot
You know like 13 14 15 years like things have changed so much
that I think it's really important for us to talk about it now and
really kind of
Trend where we've been so we can talk about where we can go
Yeah, someone's a tear don't don't do it indoors. Don't do it
Man, that's the number one thing when people had when people blew shit up. It was doing it indoors
I mean, we would just it's not that difficult to go out on a belt and he could go out into the garage
But do you know like it's it's an understanding of what you're working with
Like if you don't and that butane is back here. I'm gonna eat this up. Yeah, butane is a gas that sinks
so if you do some open blasting in your basement near your water heater
Like you are setting yourself
And and it's not going to be it's not going to be a good end result
And I think that's why
The last few years we've seen a huge huge shift in the solvent game to the solventless game where people can make their medicine
at home safely with ice water and a rosin press
Right, so that's what's kind of given this, you know birth of fire into
No, I'm not. I'm not encouraging anybody to open blast. You should not be yeah exactly doing it at all
That's it. That's exactly what we're getting at. It's what we used to do. Not smart. Well, that was you know, that was 2010 tech
2021 we have
We have progressed so much, you know with closed-loop systems with the distillation of gas
The ability to refine our extracts below one micron in terms of filtration like these things are very important and
they need to be talked about because
You know open blasting doesn't give you that same quality. It can't it just cannot
You know
Not to mention the fact you can blow up your house in the neighborhood
Well, I mean, it's not safe that that kind of goes without saying I think we under we all understand that at this point is
Open
is
Fucking dangerous
So let's not do it, you know, and and you know, I think people saying to you know, oh
Nobody smoked solvent or screw solvent. I think your point there is that you you actually made but we just grazed over it a little bit
Yeah, you know different strokes for different folks
different processes for different strains and
You know
One's not inherently better than the other in every situation and
I think you know, you know better than anybody else RJ
The way that you do your extraction and clean your product is extremely important and some things just
Some things just don't wash and you can't make solventless out of I mean Jamison's the guy with the genetics and knows that sort of
thing but it's
sometimes
doing solvent extraction and
Properly treating it properly doing it in a closed-loop system someone that's educated and doing it in a scientific way like yourself RJ
Where then you also have you know third-party testing on multiple different layers?
to ensure that it's safe working with PhDs in chemistry and
Biology to make sure that end product is clean and safe
So it's not the same thing that was there for 15 that was there 15 years ago
And that's definitely something that people should not be doing all we're talking about here is how it's evolved in the fact that we can
Even identify that wasn't good. I mean we all thought that was the next big thing
We're all gonna be making our own, you know shatter at home just like people back in the day. We're making hash
Just not great
Not great
So if we take it if we take a quick question here
I'm sure there's a couple in the audience that are wondering cuz you've all managed to take a dab so far
Like what do you guys enjoy not?
But if I can interrupt for a moment and ask I
Just went in on some delicious
Fruit joy from a local friend of mine here his local garden and it's absolutely unbelievable
And then I subsequently went in on some
Some double dosi from a friend of mine turb crusher out on the island and
He that that one was a little hot. So I had to mute myself there for a minute while I worked it out
Are those are those hash rosen? Yeah, that's hash rosin and that's all
The double dosi is 70 to 90 and the
fruit joy, I believe is
70 to 159
Yeah, that that fruit joy is maybe one of my favorites it's like literally getting blasted in the face with a bowl of fruit
I can't really describe it
You know, no on the throat on the inhale or exhale that's super clean
incredibly clean
Yeah, I I just actually hit some diamonds on that type pad just because
Diamonds I think or actually solvent based on on a type hat is probably a better call
although I don't necessarily dab tie and
Or titanium I should say and it was some legal papaya stuff actually legal from Canada from the store
Little mothership cap action. What are you dabbing urgent?
I
Just got it
So like so while we're while we're on it while raw while RJ is trying to figure is figure himself out a little bit
I also won't focus the camera right on him. What do you guys think about the Canadian market? It's a little bit different
There's not a lot of hash rosen available on the legal in the legal space. That's for sure
Wow, well, you know RJ is recovering why don't we talk about that for a minute? I
Think it's definitely still evolving. I think you know
Converting new users like a lot of the existing
Medical patients that are experienced with hash rosen are either
cultivating themselves through the ACMP our program or sourcing it through
Other means and so I think a lot of new users are looking to the Canadian legal landscape and it's gonna take
Some more evolution and some more product offerings to come and I think that's just time
So I think you know, we're improving we're getting better year after year
qualities improving in flower qualities improving in inputs and you know
understanding the users we've got a bit of an issue in the Canadian market because
We sell to government bodies who then sell to retailers
And in the most in most cases and so having
to sell your product or convince a
Government employee that your product is the right product for the market is much more difficult than say
You know early years in Washington where you could more or less, you know make something
You know in your home or you know in a shop or you know
You know in your home or you know in a shop and walk it to a retailer and say hey
You know, would you take this on and I want to prove the market out? And so we have
the evolution time of proving out
product categories and and and bringing in new users through new form factors is much longer because
Not only do we have to convince?
Provincial entities to take on this product skew, but we also have to show up with enough volume to satisfy
Their need of having to have a large enough
Volume for it to make sense to move through their system. So there's only one buyer. There's only one distro
you know in every province and so and that and that distro is a government-run agency and so it creates a lot of
It slows things it slows the evolution down of
the ability for
Canadian extractors such as RJ and many others to bring
New form factors and do small drops. So like we are a long way away from you know
90 you GMO because the sheer amount of
GMO
That you would have to process and and I mean it's it's doable
but it's just that the scale and and then the the financial gamble and then you know, we also have issues with
Transportation and we're not offered any cold chain. So
You know melt and bubble are completely off the table
But yeah, I think you know
We're doing well
And and things are getting better
Yeah, we're just slowly slowly starting to improve
Yeah, you always gotta look at you always gotta take the positive you always gotta take the glass half full
I mean like, you know, we're on the money. There's a lot of problems
Thing is just like it's it's that it's that customer conversion, right?
It's bringing the legacy customers in Canada into the legal market in the US
It was a bit easier because of the barrier to entry
Like your favorite company made the transition and then you were able to buy their house legally
Yeah, boom in Canada we haven't seen that the same way it's a lot different the barrier to entry so
You're not seeing the the immediate
The immediate surgence of like fire flower the same way that like the American markets tend to see it
Because we it's the barrier to entry is just completely different, right? We can't do it in the same way
In the same way in Canada instead of having those legacy
growers hashmakers
Extractors it was business people
That were getting the first licenses because it was solely driven by financial interest
And you know as one of our I think you know mutual friends man. He says, you know, they bastardized the plant
ambassador dies the industry
They created the infrastructure on their terms
Yeah, like that's the thing that happened to us is kind of like in terms of the industry
We kind of had the carpet pulled out from under us, right?
We didn't I don't think any of us thought coming and but you know, how much were we involved in setting things up?
Right. So yeah, I think it was just it was set up to be this way so that it could be run
by
running the corporate ocracy right run by
Corporations run by money it's more so more so than anything else
Well, I mean we've seen the failure of some of the big guys
We've seen till Ray Aurora canopy like we've seen the big guys start to falter. Yeah, right
We've seen big companies post like elves quarter after quarter after quarter
So like yeah, how long can that be sustainable also with the quality they're putting out questionable
How long can that subsist?
That's why I think the
You know
accessibility as you said
Because all the shops have to go through these hoops
To purchase the product and really even to get leases to sell their product
it becomes a
Really not so much entrepreneurial thing, but I see it more as like
real estate type investment for for some of these people and
You know legacy people which is I think everybody that's here
whether they're in the legal market or not are
Are wanting to just continue to support the people that are passionate about the plant, you know, whether it's for
The look the smell the effects whatever
It's all about the plant and and you know
For me I'm all about the terms I love the plant
I love the way it smells if I could and I probably I definitely could just have bouquets of flowers
Oh, you know in the middle of the table instead of having roses or whatever to have like, you know a papaya
And like a strawberry something cross sitting out. That's just you know done flowering you chopped it down
You have it there just sitting as flowers like from a flower shop. That'd be so cool
That'd be dope but so what you know, I think those terpenes extracted and being able to also all this has to happen at a price point
Right, like if this has to be cheap enough
Commodified enough and of a certain enough quality for all this to happen
Right, so like let's just kind of
That would be dope
That's the other thing, you know
speaking to producers who wanted to
Sell direct to consumer the way that the government has created it. It's like
You can't you can go to you know, you can go to a brewery and have a beer and watch them brew it
But you can't go to like a farm and watch them crop and dry and make cash or make you know
Resin and smoke it there. Okay, but play devil's advocate. How long did it take the craft brew industry the heady beers the fire beers?
In a numerical way, you know, I mean like I
Yeah, that's oak city, you know
Like we were we were exposed to like dope heady beers and like the late 90s early
2000s that Canada is just starting to see in the last couple years
Yeah, and a market in the US has exploded and it's been amazing. It's it's incredible to watch
But like how long did that take and how long had you know the beer market existed before that happened
So I think in terms of quality cannabis, we're seeing a much faster action. I
It's just it's it's just how
Specifically in the Canadian market about you because the American market like you guys have so much more quality and the barrier
to access that quality is much lower and in Canada like
We just all the quality not the legacy the legacy got alienated in Canada
Whereas because of the state by state legalization in the US it was still very much a risk
It wasn't fully open. It wasn't fully clear
And so it was still the risk takers that were moving into there and and and that
added a foundation of
knowledge in those states
That we built like
in Canada
we did not have that foundation and and and we had
access to way more capital and and so the mistakes we made we made on epic levels and and
You know, unfortunately, we're still making some of those mistakes today, but you know
You know it time will iron these things out, but only now are you starting to see you know?
Slowly but surely individuals slowly starting to transition in and and
C-suites understanding that you know, it's it's not a widget. It's we're not making a piece for a phone. You know, it's not a
It's not a little you know, let's optimize every square foot and squeeze as many of these
single widgets out as we can and and so
you know everyone portraying themselves as craft and everyone portraying themselves as
High quality in the in in the
initial phases of legalization in Canada really
Really, you know was a one step forward two steps back for us because you know
When all these companies say we're coming to market with the absolute premium
we're craft producers and then what comes to market is a very subpar product initially and
That's a lot of new users a lot of new entrance a lot of new conversions a lot of new individuals
We say maybe didn't consume prior to legalization
but felt comfortable with it Pope post went in and tried as premium cannabis and paid a premium price for and then went
You know what?
Not really for me
and then us as an industry now have a bit of a hole to dig ourselves out of because we have to say we know
That you might have felt a type of way about your first purchase
You know in a premium market category
Please come back and try this again and spend your hard-earned money again
And you know that that's a hard thing to do but but you know, unfortunately, that's what happened in Canada. And that's why
We are struggling with with quality is not only did we take on?
gargantuan spaces, but we didn't
Bring in the support and the culture that you know has nurtured and brought this plant along, you know for for
For at least the last 60 years arguably the last 6000 but like, you know
Even heroin and coke like they didn't have a monthly magazine that grew year over year for 30 years
well, the thing was still illegal like, you know, there was a
you know a large subculture that in Canada unfortunately was ignored and the bottom line is is that you know,
Investors suffered because of it
Yeah
What is that that looks great
modified grapes
Swiss modified grapes GMO cross with
What's the flavor profile that you have on that like what's the aroma like how does it how's it
like a really great the red wine
Kind of flavor. It's it's awesome. And it's like I thought it would be deeper into the GMO side
But it's like a really nice balance
Like
But like heavy reds, you know what I mean, it's it's got a lot of body it's
So it's not like floral it's just like it's like a grape without the sweetness
Yeah
I still don't know how I feel about the grape
I'm not like I mean, but that's the search right? Like I didn't know the artificial
banana turp
Existed the way it existed until I had the banana runs
By some guys some super talented living soil guys out in red deer
Naturally farmed and and they
Like it was friggin like sucking on that the yellow runs out of the runs package
Artificial and it was like it was just something that you were just like, you know
I'd love to have that in my fridge at all times like it's not
Desert Island like give me just that turp for the rest of time, but it's like
You know
It's like yo
I'd love to pull that out once a day and I'd love to like have that to show the homies like
Straight artificial turps. I think you know, it's out there like I've had some I
haven't had it like an actual modified grapes or actually any you know, great flavor that is has
Completely blown me away, but I absolutely bet you that are that it exists and it's out there and it's just you know
Pheno type selection, you know, you got to look through a lot of shit, you know, like
Jack mean jeans
root beer stuff is you know getting those fucking you know, those are
Yeah, oh man, it's it's yeah like busy. It's we'll get it in like three or four years
Maybe like that's yeah take some time. Yeah, I mean
It's
Those fire turps are just there. I've not blessed you guys are blessed
Yeah, that's the even just papaya
Getting real papaya turps. Honestly, the best papaya turps that I had was from I just threw away the jar
it was from ha ha which is us and
oh my god, it was oh
I'm now I'm chasing it
It's like how the hell do I get that back because nobody in Canada?
Have I had for live Ross and has that turps and the consistency was just like soft serve
Okay, describe that trip to me versus the papaya that we have
This is more like a
Exactly. It's like it's heavy on the rotting. It's not that sweet. It's got gas to it instead of just being fruit
Yeah, it's like it's rotting exactly rotting
Tropical papaya with no rot like it was a fresh fruit like you cracked it open and you took a bite
That's what the whole hatch was. Yeah
Yeah, see
And then similar fruit I got the fruit joy here as well that shit's fire and
not much left but it's like
Yeah, it's
Like a bowl of fresh fruit eat literally eating a bowl of fresh fruit that shit's fire and
I'm excited because because that guy's you know
Such a hot, you know such a guy with heart and all he wants to do is find like that perfect strain
And so he's been phenol hunting. I only know the second hand from a friend of mine and from from Jameson
For a long time on this one and he's down to four phenols and Jameson just told me he deleted two of those
so now he's down to two on the next run and it's like I don't even know how it could get better and
It just seems to every time he's also got another one called
Banana OG
That has banana turps, but like almost GMO gas to it
Like you open it up and you stink up the whole room, but it's fruity and you're like that's not GMO
You know and it but it's like it's got funk to it and it's yeah one of my absolutely
I
had a really good when I was down in Cali like the punch extract strawberry banana was was like a
fruit like that was strong strawberry like
You know not too much banana, but like strawberry with a cream finish and I really enjoyed that one. I want to stood out
Yeah, we're all talking about it's like so you have legacy because I don't find in the legal market
Do we have those terms? Yes?
I mean, it's it you know it goes that you know cold chain understanding genetics
You know these are small rooms, and and you know it's it's super a lot of care and a lot of effort
You know as we know goes into it
You know especially solving not especially just you know a lot all extracts, and so I think you know we're just
Evolving, but we're having to evolve
From the bottom up instead of the top down like these other like state operators were
The owners understood the owner the owners understood because they're you know they're dabbing the stuff
So you know it's a lot easier to
to make those changes quickly, so
You know I think it's happening, and I think that
It's it's getting better. That's a such a nice pipe man
Let's jump let's jump over to the glass here guys cuz I mean your regular eye isn't gonna like normally
Recognize this type of stuff and you guys are working on some very very very nice class right now
I'm sure you'd love to share it
RG is just finishing it. I was just heating mine up
Yeah
RJ's got maybe the best class collection that I know especially as far as like
Not just jumping on stuff right now and buying stuff
RJ is in my opinion one of the OG so since I've known him I would say for the past 15 years
He's been seriously glass collecting
For 20 years he's been collecting glass
And it's funny you see like some of the stuff like is his AK there if you don't know what it is Eric Crunk
Legacy legacy stuff, and you know you know down payment of a house worthy of a tube
And
It's crazy because
The evolution of that it never started like that
It was always just you know a little bit expensive and kind of like why would you spend any money like that on it, too?
and now
Things in glass have gotten crazy. We were talking RJ when we used to make our own oil and
The dishes that you used to have I remember you used to have all these custom dishes and
Like now it's like nobody uses those at all there's been a crazy evolution of not only the extraction game
And the glass game the intersection of both, but the evolution of how we consume as a whole
Okay, so like like like he was just saying so like
You know before you could get all these fire dogs in the store
You had to make them at home that was the only way you were getting fire hash or knowing a homie
right and
Then you know it kind of blew up with everyone making extracts at home real quick
And then we had the invent of these heavy dishes
You know to store our oil because we you know we would blast a cordless dryer
So you have a jar little dish
Big enough to hold you know your gram your your four grams grams or whatever right?
But that's all it was
at first
You know it wasn't available in a store
You had to make it or you had to know someone that did get your little dish up and that was you know
Your little dish was made and you had to make it and you had to make it and you had to make it
And you had to know someone that did get your little dish up and that was you know your oil for X amount of time
I used to make it every single night. I used to come home from work and make a batch of oil
routine
like freshly squeezed orange juice every night like clockwork and
I just got to me. That's how I needed to be I needed to have like fresh-pressed coffee. You know like
Like I just needed everything to be fresh
Oh
My cracked and then you know that just got bigger
Then I started to understand that maybe curing out resin
Was a good thing and then started curing out resin and then started you know
Or five different flavors around or seven different flavors around ten different flavors around and then you know you just pick through a little bit
of each
Because we take that in for
Granite now having
Yeah
We had plugs that brought in you know big weight and we could go to them and go shopping and get like
Seven or ten different flavors, you know between two people we were we were super blessed in our cannabis in our cannabis life growing up
So we're from Southern Ontario
Southern Ontario Canada
where
Southern Ontario is like a black hole for for cannabis just you just send everything there
And we were
We were tapped into really good stuff and
It was it was blessed back then we were able to get a lot of like fire fire weed
Yeah, but to go back to glass we were just like buying like
Well like yeah, but you know, but so oil rigs didn't exist back then our methods of dabbing didn't exist back then
so we either had to buy small bonds and
those curves like BP had or a or an oil dome and
Convert or get like a micro piece or then talk to glassblowers and start getting rigs made. Yeah
So after what we're jumping at all, okay, so back to the G girls
Which is the piece that Brian held up earlier
That's what's called G girl
So after those came out a lot of glassblowers started replicating those, right?
And that's how that kind of oil rig scene started blowing up they started replicating
And then putting their different artistic spin on things right and then there was always just a K
We're just always did his own thing and it's just explain why it's so crazy though
because I remember you showed it to me and I was like, wait a second you paid how much for that tube and
you know, I don't know less than two grand but like
Would you spend that money and now I can really appreciate especially getting a piece of that
I was like, why would you spend that money?
And now I can really appreciate especially getting into glass and understanding how it's made and how much effort each little piece takes
so each little picture is made of glass and it's called like a murini or a millefiori and
The whole thing about these tubes is they have an immense amount of prep work
Before they can be made because all these things have to be made before the tube actually gets made right?
Including all these canes a lot of Chino canes
You know what? I mean? Like
All of this prep has to be complete
dummies
Everything has to be done before you make the tube and then it's all inside out, right?
So like I can stick my finger in there and it's all it's all bumpy because it's all laid on the inside
So, I mean I'm not gonna get into the tech too much, but it's incredible
These tubes are all pretty much one of the time do it
Tell me about the tech like how does that work? Go for it?
Crazy thing is like it's crazy layers that that tube weighs like two pounds two and a half pounds
But it's like definitely thick, you know a nice thick base on it
It's just all it's all sections of glass melted into glass and they do it it's not melted in through the through the inside
It's melted. There's sorry through the outside. It's melted into the inside and then sealed up. So
It is a lot of work
These tubes are crazy
incredible detail
But they're functional monsters, you know, I mean, there's a reason like this shape is just it's a classic shape
But it's a case little spin on it
It's the bell bottom. Oof
Demons these tubes are demons and yeah, I have I have a few of them luckily
Was very blessed Tok City
It's not it's not tough to clean
It's not it's really not these tubes are super like all this stuff's really easy to clean
It's not until you get to the super elaborate stuff
Even this so this is probably one of the toughest things to clean
So one of the things to look at is you can see
That's where the bubbles come from so this is mothership
Five seed egg. So every tiny little one of those on the perk is where the bubbles come out
There's layers so bubbles only through those two layers and that's where the inside tube comes down through so
You just soak everything in alcohol and
Everybody here. We all use distilled water to use distilled water
Then you're not going to leave stains and if you change it often clean often
Chasming and chasing is basically a build-up of
crystals from carbon deposits and it binds to the actual
Courts and it actually
Times those enough to create a
Minimumitarian depression that's what I find here. I don't want to go too far into talking about corruption
There's just hundreds and hundreds of billions of humans
courts and at almost melting temperature and then you end up basically reducing the efficiency
of heat transfer and retention and makes it a less effective piece of court.
So you know taking care of your courts, taking care of your glass, it's just like anything
you know you're not going to throw an expensive shirt or whatever into the into laundry altogether
and let it get torn up and throw it into the dryer you're going to you know potentially
have it on gentle cycle or have to you know put it into you know hand washing and hang
it up that's just the way it's got to go.
Take care of your shit.
Yeah.
That's it.
Fucking take care of it.
I mean it's the same thing too if you're making hash or you're making you know extracts your
equipment if you're not cleaning it quickly.
Are you drinking out of empty cups?
Are you eating off of dirty fucking plates?
What's acceptable?
Yeah that's true.
That's a good way of putting it.
Right?
Yeah.
So yeah I mean we're all guilty of like when we smoked flour.
Smoking flour creates so much more because it's like that actual plant material and you're
not going to combust all of it and if you pull that through into your bong leaving that
for more than a few hours you're going to grow mold and that's what makes it disgusting.
I don't like smoking weed.
Dab or vape or you know.
I want to know what Jameson's got going what he pulled out of that bat cooler.
I think there's a few people that are wondering that.
Oh hold on.
Okay first of all like I got to focus like it's so funny and it's just such an awesome
little mini cooler and I if you can Jameson I think you should show it a little bit and
go through maybe some of the stuff that you have if you're okay with that if you're open
to that.
It's the Terp cooler.
It's the it's the full blown Custy 5000 wannabe a Wook.
You know it's a fridge it you know like any other fridge.
I've got some jars in here.
A lot of this stuff is my own and big league genetics stuff that we work on.
So we've got the space cake of ours that we're super proud of that just did over 5% in the
wash.
So we didn't even you know we actually didn't hunt it to be a washer and and we didn't you
know we didn't we loved it for smoke and it's got like a super funky it's like it's
the snow lotus by it's from Bodie and it's the snow lotus by a cookie of some kind and
I'm blanking out on it but it the funk comes through like it's super like gym socks and
just rank like it and a little bit of gas but when you crack the jar and open it from
afar it smells like gas and then when you really get it up to your nose it's just straight
funk and how it dabs is funk forward with like a finish of gas and there's like no really
fruit or anything to speak of like maybe a cookie in the back if you look for it but
it's it's really it's really nice.
I grabbed some...
Can you drop a breeder's name?
Can you drop the breeder?
Who's the breeder?
That's Bodie.
That's Bodie Seeds.
That's at Plant More Seeds.
That's that's you know the the dude that's you know one of the guys that you know went
and did it a long time ago.
I've got some grape guava from OG Globby Johnson that just won a cup we have up here in Canada
as well as the I believe he won the Pelle Pellare cup down south which is pretty cool
and it's got some super interesting grape guava turps on it and I that was pretty dope
and then yeah a lot of other stuff just from the test garden.
What else do I have?
A little bit of chart.
Did you say test garden?
Well I think that just speaks to my interest.
Yeah a lot of you know a lot of different stuff where we're always looking through to
kind of see what washes and what smokes well and you know kind of looking for specific
things so I'm very blessed to kind of you know have a network of guys and see a lot
of stuff and so I had some uppercut from an outdoor hunt that I did a couple seasons back
which is the LA Confidential by the Purple Punch from Oney or Symbiotic.
I always think it's Symbiotic but yeah the Cherry Cookie Breath from Relentless was another
old hunt I did that did really well outdoors and yeah a couple things from Living Earth
Organics a local Alberta guy shout him out and he got the shirt off his site he does
some really cool clothing so shout out Blowtoke Smoke.
But yeah no always you know trying new stuff and yeah I know Brian's got some crazy flavors.
What do you got going on there Brian?
That's a Blowtoke Smoke's GMO pretty pretty ranked GMO pretty nice one I've also got an
OMG and that's from High Fidelity Solvent.
That's actually a female can't really see it but this is like almost a clear.
Oh there we go nice one and yeah I'm all about that those GMO terms OMG is a GMO back
cross that's why it's OMG and yeah one of one of my favorites I don't know which which
GMO in general is my favorite Jameson and I were talking about that a little while ago
I would love to add some sort of amazing GMO to my garden so that I can wash some fire
ranked herb.
Are these all are these are all hash rosin or?
These are all live live live rosin or live hash rosin yeah and again when we when we
say we're you know someone made a comment about full effects of cannabinoids you know
when you're taking live plant material so what you're taking is you're chopping it down
you're trimming that up and you end up putting that into the freezer right away and then
from there you're putting that into ice water you know with ice and you're mixing it and
stirring it that's how you're making your hash and then you're pulling it throwing that
into the freeze dryer you're preserving the terpenes and preserving the cannabinoids it's
to the highest amount whether you're washing it for hash or whether you make live resin
which is as well what's what's not if you're using butane or hydrocarbon extraction but
yeah then for for the hash then you're in then you press it but that's what we're smoking
here and so really temperature control I think is one of the most important things all well
RJ uses a different way to heat it up but we all we all make sure that we dab it super
low low temperature so that we can have you know terpene preservation you know that was
I think one of the downfalls of these old school titanium pads you need to heat them
up to about a thousand degrees and you have about one to maybe two seconds to get your
dab on there and be able to actually hit it otherwise it's gone down in temperature to
you know lower than 200 degrees so yeah but it's like it's all of it's how primitive it
was to write like no but now we have like temperature sensors you know the dab right
the turbometer the temp tech the you know even even going back you know using using
the old you know infrared one but it's all about right you know where where we were in
time with that you know take that into consideration right yeah yeah well I don't think freeze
dryers were really like a thing right like they've been around in industry but I don't
think they've been around in Canada yeah when did they come to like 2016 maybe that's what
I'm saying so like if you're going back 10-15 years it didn't exist for like rosin didn't
exist no you had bubble action you used to make bubble hash all the time right like but
like also everyone the way that we have rosin like this interpretation of rosin is rosin
version 2 right like this this kind of rosin was recreated from the original which was
essentially taking really really melty hash and rubbing it on the inside of like a hot
pyrex pan so you put like a hot pyrex pan in the oven pull it out and then rub a melty
hash all over and let that oil come out and then you would scrape it all up and then you
would have like rosin that's what rosin originally was was rubbing really melty hash on a hot
pan and then scrape or if you had really good rosin then you would just be able to press
it and dab a flag or a really good hash yeah but that's how it was you would just dab really
nice hash like you know pre-rosin is like incredibly expensive well I mean it's still
expensive but it was incredibly more expensive and rare but pre-rosin everyone focused on
kind of I think a higher quality of cannabis because everyone wanted to make six star like
full melt hash and then once you could press hash you could kind of not quite give as much
of a fuck about the hash because you're just gonna press it right I think that's kind of
what happened bring back the six star so so let's jump over to kind of like I feel like
I feel like bubble is it like a gift for like the people who really are about it like I
feel like you know like that's that's that's for that's for the homies right like that's
just for the people who like you know really really care sorry did you know I was muted
and I just wanted to say that I think it for everyone I mean the fact that it the fact that
this it's in stores in Cali and in places like 710 labs pay to put refrigerators and
freezers in and like you know do customer service like that's that's that's awesome
like the fact it's really unfortunate that we're not there yet in Canada but I'm really
excited for the day that we get there me too it's gonna take a while but like yeah I mean
yeah you guys are blessed and yeah understand what you have yeah yeah very hard to get here
yeah yeah that quality of melt at that readily available state it's just doesn't exist in
Canada it's the only talkative melt so talk I have like melt and temps and stuff like that
like you talked about kind of the the temp guns and regulating temperatures because you're like
what I remember growing up is like you get it's lasted hot now and you get that thing
ripping south degrees and you and you put it in there and you're talking about measuring
temperatures and stuff like that and the evolution of it you guys have some rad ass
heaters even down to that point so can you talk about that a little bit well I think that just
talks to like the evolution of dabbing first you just got it hot and you took your fucking
rip you know what I mean then you didn't know any better and that's how you know when people
at that point it was all on like my nails and that's when like that's when dabbing really
kind of got its first like wave was like the titanium nail days when they got like died
the dome less dome less titanium nails but for me around like 2011 2012 I think and that coincided
with I think certain states going legal and then just product offerings being there so then the
quality of the consumption had to go up you know what I mean to kind of match the products that
were being made and then things just started to evolve I think everybody to wanted to look for a
safer way to consume and I you know the reason people now say fuck BHO is because they're
thinking back to the open blasting days yeah potentially buying you know whatever type of
butane or propane or whatever that the people were using and it's like it's now when it's a
scientific friggin lab and it's like you get your products in and you're literally multiplying the
filtration on just the butane with or whatever and it's like it's a completely different you
know version of what it used to be it's the same thing as like hash you know original hash you know
going back to like India is like you know hand of charas and it's like you know walking by and
getting resin on your hands and pulling it off and smoking it right and it's like yeah if that's
not the same as the hash that is like live rosin and that's still hash it's it's a different it's
hash oil but it's still yeah that's what I mean but it's made from a derivative right yeah but
that's what I'm saying like everybody's like oh fuck it's like yeah you remember a lot of it does
stem from like the open blast days but a lot of it too is like people don't know what's going on
like when people when it was in people's hands they could understand it they could wrap their
heads around it right but when they when they're removed from it now it's like oh I don't know
what's going on right I don't know what's you know and like it's like yes you have an understanding
that a lot of people at higher-end labs and who give a fuck are taking precautions to make a
quality product you want to put a fire product out on the market right and like I have lab tests to
support everything I thought right but like I pride myself on that being an extractor right I
know but it's it's just I can't speak I can't speak for everyone else that's my shit no but
shit that's on the legal side has one tested in it literally when I'm leading into so like now
it's like a fuck me a joke fuck CRC thing but a lot of trap boys slapping powders that they don't
understand the chemistry behind they don't know what they're making right they don't know how to
filter it properly they don't know what they're doing and like that's what it comes down to is
like when we put a product on the legal market it is our duty to present a product that we understand
to be of a certain level of quality and like in Canada we have to prove it body of health Canada
it's a it's a different product than what was made when I absolutely agree fuck that old
VHL that we used to make that shit is not and we should have never been making it we should have
been trying to fucking make your own bubble pack dude the amount of shit or be consumed
yeah and here okay so here's why so everyone understands here's why it's oil is because the
gas wasn't distilled so like that's what it comes down to now we have the ability to distill and
clean our gas prior to using it right just like you would have clean water and clean ice right
we have a clean extraction system and clean gas I mean you could equate it to people that
used to make hash from like you know waters through their like garden hose people still
do and it's you know I would say like it dried prop not the same but like you know well I mean
depending on your water source that could be really bad yeah depending on your water source
that could be really bad you know which is why you try to use clean water just like you're having
a clean solvent it care to have everything be clean down to your all your in and take care to
think what all your inputs are especially like your water ice or like your gas what's on your
filter what's on your media you know make sure everything's pre cleaned prior to use and if if
you have the ability in a legal in a legal way I'm not in legal way but like a testing capacity
that's more I meant to say if you have the ability to test your surfaces even prior to use do so
then you'll endure the cleanliness of everything right that's what this is about everything needs
to be clean actually prior to use so that you have a clean product a verified clean product
and go into the market with confidence the other thing too is looking at yield you know when you
talk about hash or live rosin or hash rosin you know your yields comparatively of what you're
actually stripping out of the plant material if you want to if you want to be efficient and take
everything out of it whether it's for consumption in that raw or to make other things the best way
to do that is likely through solvent if well I mean yes but like it's it's all about how to
maximize quality and what do you want is your end product well that's also exactly it so like right
now you know back to what we were talking about earlier on in the show it's it's the trend to that
at-home movement away from you know making your solvent extracts at home but now making your
list extracts at home because it's safer right and then you yourself have your hands on the quality
so whatever you deem your standards to be you know you can have that and then so like that's
also why everyone thinks that they're smoking the fire because like I made it and like I appreciate
that I totally appreciate that you know I think that's the same thing as when you cook if you
absolutely absolutely so it's just like you know like I made it it's got to be like the
purest thing ever like everybody's mom makes the best whatever but seriously though my mom makes
the best you either like you either know nothing about it or you're like I smoke the best because
I either get the best that I know or that I have available to me or I grew and it's the best
because I grew it and it's the best that I can do absolutely I think that's that's a that's a
common thread line through you know real consumers in our industry and and and you know guys who have
been constantly searching for that like you know we've been smoking mids and severe 14 but searching
for that quality and always like you put I mean like like I smoked the most quality mids in my
mind you know looking back right like it was but yeah exactly so I think that there's a you know
a common thread through individuals like ourselves who you know have found something that we like and
and understand that you know even though we're always looking for the better thing we know we
might we know we're never gonna find it like I get asked a lot like in phenol hunting like so are you
gonna ever find it and and be like this is the great this is the best grape you're ever gonna
find and I don't think you ever get satisfied right you just explore new avenues and you know
variety is the spice of life and like you know the variation within you know the effects and
the and and the subsequent flavor profiles that are associated with them is you know what draws
me so deeply into you know looking for that next thing that you know we don't know exists so I think
that that's a common thread throughout all of us I mean GMO didn't exist 10 years ago did it yeah
and that changed the game you know and you have you know the difference but the difference you
know GMO and everything and everything else makes sorry the difference between GMO and a lot of the
other strains that have made a lot of waves in these last few years is that GMO garners the
respect of almost everybody you know as far as the breeding community it's like nobody you know GMO
is something special that's that's definitely changed the landscape and you know you still see
it very prevalent down in Cali and you know you haven't even you know just started to see it but
I think you know that GMO turp is similar to that to that OG smoke where it's like you can capture
an audience and you can basically have that consumership say you know what I'm done looking
I will smoke this and as long as you continue as long as you continue yeah I do know it's it's so
mammico seeds bread it it's it's it's originally called chem cookies and then skunk master flex did
the selection on the GMO and it yeah it's it's it's super special I mean it grows like a like a
and and as long as you're willing to wait for it and you know we have friends I know guys that take
it as early as nine weeks I think that's purely for extract but you know I know guys that'll go
deep with it and and it's a it's a special plant so I think that you know and it's different than
the chem but it's the chem to the Girl Scout so it you know and there's a lot in there and you know
we know some guys who are doing some work and then there's some guys who you know s1d it and
are looking through that and I think that you know like I said I think that GMO is a unique
enough profile that you could you know as a small craft operator be like we're gonna perfect GMO and
we're gonna make GMO hash rosin and we're not gonna look through anything else and I think you
could really capture I believe you could capture an audience that you know exclusively wants to
go back to that you know the same way that OG kush or blue dream you know we're sour diesel had
such staying power and in other markets I think that GMO is gonna have that same staying power
because it's it's it's like art right it's like you either love it or you hate it like you know
like nobody feels neutral about GMO like nobody's like I'm like okay it's like yo I love that shit
or yo that is disgusting and I don't want that smell near me and I definitely don't want it
inside of me so you know I love it like it's it's probably you know gun to my head desert
island string in a jam if I couldn't really think through stuff you know done well I love GMO so you
know I think shout out GMO I got I love GMO too so like I'm not saying anyways I think couldn't you
say that about all the big ones like throughout kind of like strain has like skunk number one and
then like you know NL like the whole NL series and then you get like kush when kush dropped kush
changed the game yeah right on it but like on what about you can't use but like you can't use
cushion but cheeses cheeses were more regional yeah yeah kush was like changed everything right
so like you like GMO is is the next big one to me like you still have people smoking OG right like
the only people smoking the only people smoking NL 5 and stuff like that are like hard core head
hardcore breeders that are like oh geez like and they're not like they can't just get it they have
to grow it themselves like but like oh oh gee cush is still being grown that's the that's the difference
right like like blue dreams like played out but it's it's it's coming back and it's like those
that have the staying power it's it's you know it you know it's it's just like being popular in
Hollywood or whatever like it's easy to it's easier to be popular for two to five years than it is to
be for 20 and so you know for a guy to grow up in the you know 90s smoking OG and then somebody
an OG still being present present 20 years later you know and be and before that has that has you
know that's impressive yeah that's true I mean that's what I mean as RJ said when you think of
like original or like even strains now like Mac right like a GMO to me that's and I even think the
fruity terms will get sick you know I think the fruits change and I think like like I like being
able like the run stands out to me of being able to bring a gas effect with a fruit profile with
no gas present and I think you know having more of that and and you know I think they'll be fruits
of the year like I think you'll always have to have a fruit category and you know it'll get more
interesting and I think it you know I believe it's all like fashion and it's all like you know it's
all cyclical you're gonna see you know like we're starting to see a lot more hazes come in a lot
more of those metal flavors a lot more you know I think that that in breeding like I see that coming
on the horizon and I think that that's good and I think that you know we'll start folding in more
ethereal almost quasi psychedelic effects into more palatable comfortable polyhybrids that maybe
don't have you know super heart racing effects like you know they'll be always that category of
those people who want those and I think that that's you know a category unto its own but I
think bringing in some of those really cool effects of those equatorials without maybe some
of the sometimes perceived negative effects of those equatorials is gonna be sort of what comes
next and and seeing those things trans translated to hash right like these hazes hash well and so
you know understanding how that's going to come to the market and how that affects that you know
the price per gram when you're taking it 13 14 15 16 you know I think that I think that we're
gonna start like we've kind of pushed our way as far as we can into like the dessert cookie space
and I think the fruit line will continue and I think that you know that it'll be interesting to
see where it morphs where it goes if it goes more savory and you know leans more heavily on that GMO
lineage or or leans more into the fruit but you know I think that we're probably close close to
closer than we're closer to the end of desserts then we're to the finish or to the start if that
you know that's my belief that's just my opinion I don't know my search is all like I like having
a fruit trip around but GMO I could always have around or like something that's just gas something
that I open up and it's just like oh shit it like burns the back of my throat like yeah
certain staples would just never go away I love trough I can't dive it all day every day but like
I always yeah I'm just so I just it's good for me it's like ice cream cake it's just what is it
what is it that you really enjoy about that RJ like is it the specific terpene or is it the bouquet
no but I then I get like a cookie like to it so like yo I want pizza turds to whoever said that
tomato turds like we're what about tomato turds or like or like pepper pepper pepperoni Canadian
yo shout out to Canadian breeders ketchup perps let's go Oh ketchup chips like right
well while we're on it who's got the best ketchup chips I'm a old Dutch you know do we have a winner
okay you know who does you know who's doing a really interesting project is Dutch blooms and
Nick Risen for they teamed up to form houses selection and they're doing like they're looking
for whiskey Turks so they're trying to bring in like like oak and like shout out to those guys
I'm super excited to see what they were like so from way back I think it was 2009 cannabis cup in
chocolate chocolate so our friend Manny he's got that in his in his you know vault of you know
living mothers and I I'm so badly want to get that I love those it was so unique to get chocolatey
but with a melon almost like menthol taste at the end in your mouth yeah just gorgeous and I've
never seen it over here so I've had I've one experience that like one of the sessions I used
to throw because I used to throw sessions at my house that I lived in when I was in my mid-20s
like I spoke that session is like all the fucking time and I had one homie who who grew out some
some chocolate and then made some BHO some open blast days you know this was like 2009 probably
probably like 2005 yeah we had a place safety so like this is 2009 tech so like this is 2021 we've
grown from this but he freshly blasted some of his chocolate brought it over for the sash and
it was like the ripest cantaloupe dipped in milk chocolate and then just dabbing that my met my
mouth was just dripping like I didn't even I couldn't comprehend that flavor for that flavor
profile in like a dabble product I just didn't think or a cannabis product period like I just
it blew me away and it's still to this day one of the craziest flavors I've ever had you know
and that was an open blasted you know I only had it as flour back in like Amsterdam that year and
I was like this is my absolute favorite bud I've ever had in my entire life how do I like get more
of this and then another one that was like an old one that I know people will remember it's Alaskan
that was one of the first like like almost lemony gas ones that I've ever had and it like just looked
so I don't know airy in the bud it wasn't like I don't know it was almost like a spiky type of
bud so I never had a fresh sample of that I only had Alaskan Thunderfuck once and it was like a
two and a half year old three year old sample I think and so like it didn't have the flavor that
was all there but I vaped a bunch of it and it was like like the most racy like cocaine like yeah
whoo it was like a crazy high and I wish I I wish I got that again because it was fire
three years old the smooth and like it was a crazy fucking high what do you got in the back
hiding away that's like one of those things are dick is you got some stuff hidden away that's like
old and specialist or is there a special treat you might want to show the people today you look
yeah actually had something in mind this is this looks dark and it is but this is some old live
resin that I made in 2018 I think one of my last consultations that I did for a grower and MMR so
he was a patient up here in Canada so I did some extraction work for him taught him how to do some
extractions for some crop and I got a little bit of this hiding away there's a couple more jars
where this came from and as it ages out it just gets more like because it's it's wedding cake
gelato from like the hype of those days gelato yeah so like it's it's just got us like cookie
do you know which gelato I don't it was crazy nug though like it was it was awesome it was
awesome to work with and then like a month after that is when I started with the company that I'm
currently with so that was like December 2018 and in January 2019 I converted to the legal market so
that's kind of some of the head stash that I have in a freezer backed up and sealed away just you
know that rainy day shit but I also have a much larger head stash as well yeah my I got actually
almost two year old live live rock in the frigid freezer but you know that takes a while for it to
come to temperature so that you can even do anything with it yeah yeah fucking it up now
dabbing on the last of the sweet blue from blowtoke really really nice kind of like cheesy
blueberry I haven't had a trip like that in a long time I'm a big fan of cheese I haven't seen it in
a minute done well and yeah I'm gonna have to grow some just just to have some around just to keep
to the head and I don't know about the cheese side and I love the blueberry turps I feel like
those are again more like old-school turps the blueberry you don't see that around anymore no
and and I remember how to whip like okay so this is like 25 maybe longer years ago I had I was at
like a lemon haze and like yeah I love the cheese but I didn't like it with the blueberry I love it
I love it I'm surprised I'm super surprised that nobody's taking like a strong UK or a strong
Exodus and gone into all this like just take everybody's work take all this dessert work and
just make cheesecake lines and it's just you're the cheesecake man like you know I didn't this
that was like oranges orange cheese like any funk like the Exodus that I had was fucking crazy
wait the Exodus that you had was what I got some yeah like oranges funk like this was
16 2017 you got a real able bag Exodus cheese or just Exodus it was like Exodus I got it as
cook but like no I'm talking Exodus cheese I'm talking about UK cheese in Amsterdam
that was what it was sold like to us as the genetics but like it was orange funk craziness
Brian you had I mean once you cross something into something like and you know you're looking
through progeny and it's like oh you know we threw some of this into some of that and then
you could get what you know you can get all kinds of weird stuff so yeah I'm not surprised
but if you're like yeah you can't cheese I'd be like yeah it should be cheesy no it was it was
like orangey piney like it was like that Tropicana cookies like dead ringer for that flavor I remember
some of the best UK cheese I got was before I knew what good weed was and the the guy who got
it thought that the guy that sold it to him sold him bad like moldy weed because it smelled like
like really really cheesy and like I love cheese so like I smelled it and like you know I've always
been a proponent like if it smells you know if you bought if it smells good to your body you know
so I'm looking through the buds and they're clean like and I'm like no there's no mold in
here I know what mold looks like I'm like alright I'm gonna smoke this best shit ever like I remember
there's some stuff that came through before legalization and it was some white cheese and
I had a little I got a little bit of it and then I smoked it and it was like like it was probably
my first experience where I was like really like lock and key as far as like optimizing my me as a
person on it like maybe not the first time but one of the one of the really like those strains that
really stands out that did really well and really helped me and and I bought up as much as I could
and then I remember you know it's back in the day of when it's gone it's gone and then you know you
go but you trace it back as far as you can and you're like hey when the next you know when's more
white cheese coming can you get some more and they're like I know I think you know that's done
it's like what I don't think people like yeah people didn't you know I think it was more like
you've got a pack of seeds yeah and then like you grew it all up yeah yeah I filled your room and
multi mothers like it was you know you pop a 10 pack and then you get 10 you'd hopefully say it
was fans you get 10 moms that would speed up you populating your room and then you'd you know clone
up to whatever size you need off those 10 so you have the phenotypic variation of the 10 or yeah
the 10 in the room and then you know I think that at least that's how I know a lot was started and
then eventually one selected out but that's how like two guys who needed to get started and didn't
want to own it you know flower out 10 or 20 or 30 or 40 and then hold it down because they had to
get going I think yeah I think that's pretty much how it used to be everyone's pop and beans seeing
what worked but like a lot of fire genetics was lost you know I mean that would you know I think
do really well if we brought them back again especially in the market that's evolved what's
the other thing with like keeping everybody who's like they don't want to share they don't want to
share you know oh these are my turps it's my unique profile I think you know well we all know a lot
more goes into it it's you know how are you growing it what are the lights what is the condition you
know what is the soil what is the nutrients what is the just everything temperature even variation
now like you think about no no but people now don't like even back then people didn't want to
share it they want to sell you the but no well yeah people never wanted to share shit but people
still there was more like when we were coming up and like kush hit like a lot of dope genetics got
thrown out because they weren't kush and people were growing absolutely stellar path and couldn't
sell them because you know what I mean like that that's to me when the the biggest culling of fire
genetics happened in the recent time yeah right because there was so many dope genetics that were
out there that are now lost yeah and that was the biggest reason why and now it's just like you know
if people stay growing the hype strains then the true gems will just be lost right at least at
least for rosin and hash it's a different story people are growing and really literally taking a
microscope to it and you know as we've talked about in the past you take a microscope to it
and whatever grows in your condition and then you share with somebody else you hope that it does the
same but it may not right and but even still at least then you can share it and then if you were
to get it back and put it in the same condition in your situation it would do the same it's true
but again now it's like really looking underneath the microscope I think you know beside or even if
you had GMO you want to make sure that you've got other mothers and other phenomes that you that you
want because yeah you want to you may want to smoke that all day but I don't know you want
variation I think that's where like the wedding cake thing you know it's played out but you see
it on the back end of so many things right like it's it's fucking awesome to grow I mean it takes
a little longer but it's awesome to grow okay I think that yeah I think that like it's all cyclical
I think that there are very few things that are truly lost it has to do with the amount of work
one is willing to undertake to go find something and it's all in that genetic that you can open up
and you know as long as you've got your pre-cookie stuff which exists and is out there you know
there are librarians and curators in this culture that have for sure kept those I think that if
there's enough market demand for it and that can be identified and then you know somebody can be
properly remunerated for their efforts you know you can open up large populations and go find
things I think that you know it's been done on an at an underground level and at a hobbyist level
it's only now starting to be done at a larger level and it's you know either being done for
you know with good intentions or bad intentions but you know I think that there's not much that
would be forever lost if you were able to give the right person the keys to the right facility
with the right genetics and enough time I was gonna say it's kind of like well not kind of
like it's evolution yeah right if you were to look through enough of them you're gonna get a
variation same thing if you were to lose like I think of like in a bacteria if you were to lose
this sort of resistance to a medication but you were to grow it out enough in that thing you would
eventually get that resistance built back up so the same thing I think like say you were to lose
I've never really had peach turps either bar I find bar to be super peachy I've had some peachy
barb like crazy yeah the great gardener that's another great gardener absolutely great gardener
I've got some barb right here and like I don't know I don't really get a straight fuzzy peach
to me yeah like I like peach if a peach was to hug me with like a weighted blanket that's what
I was gonna say so see you lost peach turps right you wouldn't yeah I think you go get it
you could be able to like say start with a papaya and we like either cross it and then find a pheno
variation that would get it back to it maybe not the same maybe better maybe worse but yeah yeah
what where it's going and what fruit is is definitely interesting to me like you know
what what we're gonna see versus what California and you know other sort of zones of influence
like you know Spain and places like that like what what's what's the next you know line of
fruits that we're gonna have a focus on I've never had a plum you know stone fruit would be a cool
exploration you know I know compound in his early days did a little bit of apricot work I have some
I haven't I've watched it I've never seen any of it watch but yeah I think that there's you know
there's definitely a lot of room and I'm really excited to see where you know all these super
talented guys take it I'm gonna hit the barb you gotta hit the bar five the bar yeah I think I
that's one where it's like you know you can always find it again I don't know about GMO though GMO
again I think it's something real special yeah and I feel like a lot of people are guarded they
don't want to share their GMO yeah but yeah Barb Barb I think is a nice one I think GMO is borderline
getting to you know where og you know og kush was where it's been you know it's it's out enough
that it's available to the right people and you know it will over saturate but you're always gonna
have those mainstays like you know kick Canada's legal market is somehow very influenced by what's
going on in California in some ways and completely ignorant to them in others and you know so when
California says there's too much ice cream cake there's all the sudden too much ice cream cake up
here and you know I think that GMO is very quick to you know to be the topic of some memes just
with you know the the amount of people down south growing it and I I'm really just upset because I
know how much influence that you know means like that will have on you know the the legal side of
Canadian this and I don't want I don't want GMO not to have its time in the Sun here in Canada and
you know there's a couple cultivators with it but you know it's something that I think you know if
they if the management teams of some of these large publicly traded companies were able to see
like you know how many companies were growing this kind of chem cookies down in you know one state
maybe like okay well you know maybe and then and then it goes back to the issues of you know
selling to the province and the province saying oh we've already got two people selling us GMO so we
don't need any more GMO and you know trying to explain that my GMO is different than your GMO
but you know that you know that's a conversation for another day I I'm I wish we could share cuts
in terms with the US like it's it's kind of sad that you know how amazing would this industry be
it's gonna be interesting when federal legalization happens for sure every border didn't exist and you
could literally know it still will though it's still it's still well because Canada you know
makes it you know a point of protecting their industries and you know we've you know built to
capacity I think on cultivation space and so I think that like other industries I I think that
there'll be a protectionism stance from the Canadian government but like if you look at tomatoes the
same tomatoes the same strains are grown north of the border and south of the board yeah right
like why certain companies already own other companies cross-border oh sure I guess we're
seeing that with cookies we just saw that with cookies well they're well there's they're doing
licensing thing I believe right I don't think cookies is is they're just licensing through
another company and that's how their brand is here canopy as an entity owns companies in the
US though like currently I don't know if they can bring genetics back and forth but like just coming
real quick and like once federal legalization hits in the US and there's like federal you know one
federal I think it's more knowledge you know honestly but it's like once it like the US is
as federally legalized as Canada to be able to sell genetics back and forth in terms of a business
transaction will then be more viable right it's just currently in the current framework of things
that is not legally possible you know it's yeah that really happens you know when when Canadian
companies start up well no it's a name game and it's you know it's frustrating on that level and
you know is this the cutter is this you know from seed and you know the consumer isn't at a point to
be educated at that level yet and so you know that's you know able to happen and you know it's
unfortunate but you know I I honestly think that we can spend you know forever in a day talking
about how shitty some of these regulations are but I think it's how we operate within them that
we can really you know generate some forward movement you know it's it's like I'm not we still
have some fire up here in Canada yeah yeah yeah great fire you know our friend you know that that
makes this joy and this Barb and this banana og and you know that's just one example we've got
many others like low-toke smoke who has his you know there's some fire up here and we just don't
have the same number of people that are doing it as there are in the States that's just a numbers
thing and I think just looking at it from a breeding and from a washing standpoint you need
to wash so many different strains to figure out what's gonna dump and you need to breed so many
different strains to figure out where the turps are that you want and really perfect and then make
sure that it's growing the way that you want yeah well like just so people understand the population
of Canada could easily fit into California and they could still have a bunch of Californians
around like that that's that's literally the way it is population of California is more than the
population of Canada so like the amount of cannabis breeding and cannabis businesses actually doing
genetic work per capita in California is much greater than all of Canada so like there's that
yeah I don't know I think it well I think that like on some factors yes but like you don't want
to blindly run into a comment like that like it's like like the amount of money that Canada has been
able to raise the market is bigger yes but the amount of money that has been raised and I don't
know these numbers and that's why I'm like I don't know but the amount of money raised in Canada is
significant and you know so I think that on one scale the California market is much bigger and
on most scales much more sophisticated but from a capital raise and expenditure point it's it's
quite significant up here it's much larger representative per capita size as representation
I'm just saying like we all know a lot of people and we just don't see the same amount of genetic
work coming out of the yes factual yeah absolutely yeah no I couldn't agree with that more absolutely
companies that have dedicated facilities breeding right I'm just talking about green and that goes
and that goes back to my car like that goes back to my comment from the beginning about like it
happened because real ones were the foundation of these industries right so like when guys came in
and there was state legalization there was probably a plan at the table when they sat down with their
investors saying hey listen like we've got these cuts or we've got these seeds but you know we need
to factor in nine months of phenol hunting before we're into full-scale swing production because I
got to look through all this stuff and so a lot more forethought was laid which means there were
a lot more less bumps in the road whereas when you to compare it to you know it's Canadian counterpart
on a much larger scale by the time that you know licenses were granted there was no time to phenol
hi there was you know what can we fill these rooms with now and start so we can get some numbers so
we can give some accurate projections to our shareholders and investors who want a return and
then they grow out the cults were once twice three times they get some numbers they average them out
and then they go back to their investors and say hey listen we can commit to repay you at this at
this fast and they go great that sounds good and then somebody comes along to them and says hey
this isn't really good like you should probably phenol hunt for a new thing and they're like okay
what's phenol hunt looking like and it's like well you're gonna carve out this much of your facility
and look through stuff and they're like well can we sell this stuff yeah it's it's all mishmash so
you're gonna have to sell for less we don't like the sound of that we can't do any of that so I
think that you know there's when there's more sophistication and experience going into like
starting an enterprise you know a lot less somewhat you know arguably obvious mistakes
that guys like us would see don't get made yeah yeah that's the fact that in Canada it was let's
get product to market ASAP it just circles back to like the barrier to entry and how the kind of
market was set up right but yeah it a lot less a lot less people at the top actually I'm not gonna
start saying stuff so like like come by canopy and Aurora at least I can say shit like that
they have proven that like people at the top just don't really know what's going on and that's why
they have big L's unfortunately like I was gonna say I don't know if you guys want to keep going
for a little bit here or if you guys want to take a little break or how are we doing boys I'm good
I'm easy do you guys want to talk maybe a little bit about what you get might have planning coming
up as time goes by we can keep going here everybody's really happy and enjoy the conversation
pop it yeah why don't you dive in a little bit RJ about the glass stuff that we want to talk about
and you know your couple ideas you have starting yeah get people excited about what's going on
because you guys have some mad stuff they've been talking yeah so I've been glass collecting for
for probably about 15 years been pretty pretty lucky to to see a lot of things and see the market
evolve it's been it's been really cool so definitely wanted to kind of talk about what
glass kind of means to us you know how we started collecting glass and a little bit about kind of
what we're dabbing out of today so yeah I I've been serious about glass collecting I guess for
about 15 years starting about 2006 I always had a couple bongs glass bongs lying around before
that but I you know was kind of like a part-time smoker and I really kind of took a turn when I
started working at a hedge shop and then you know started working on orders and started seeing what
else is out there in the market and then kind of stumbled into Toro in like 2007 and I was like
whoa like these guys are crazy like this is what you can do with bombs like hold shit like I didn't
know this was a thing and quickly maybe a year after that 2008 I think yeah 2000 or 2008 late
2007 early 2008 I found Tok City which at that point was like the place for all glass knowledge
they had glassblowers themselves posting up their own work and it was like kind of like an open
source knowledge forum run by people who actually knew what was up and it was all passion and it was
just you know a small group of heads that were just all into glass culture and then you know
a couple growers and then a couple of extractors and that was just kind of like how everything
started to match and by that point I think the forum had already been up for three or four years
potentially so it are it had already had a history and then when I came on it was definitely like
kind of a more established thing and back then there was like the front-end forum so there was
just like the community posts and you could sign up right now and start posting type deal and then
there was a back end to the forum that was like invite only so if you were some some member who
came on and you kind of knew what you're talking about and you were like into glass or like you
had a glass collection yourself or you know someone could vote for you in some way someone
of you know the community vouched for you you could kind of get like an admission into the into
the the back end of the forum which was called the the private glass forum and that's where artists
would post their stuff up direct that they were posting pictures of in other threads so it'd be
like hey like that's a crazy piece wow I wish I could buy that and then you know in the back end
it's already up for sale for members for like you know 800 900 bucks and back then that was so much
money you know what I mean 2008 2009 like that amount of money was crazy for a piece like eight
or nine hundred dollars like spending a thousand bucks on a piece like on like it was like didn't
even make sense to me back then you know like I was like okay like two three hundred bucks like
400 bucks maybe like I think I have another a K downstairs and I paid like 750 or 800 us for a set
and like it was just like one of those things where I'd already been into glass for like a
couple years and I've already been committed and I'd already been into Tok City for a couple years
and I already like decided that I really loved a case work and I wanted to start collecting it
and that I just I didn't know what anything was really worth people were kind of tight-lipped
about prices so unless you could kind of make like good friends with someone that could actually give
you that influence it was kind of hard to figure out what things were worth but people would post
up things for pretty reasonable prices and then you know I would just try to see if it was in my
budget to jump on though that's that set that I just talked about that at the time was the most
I've ever spent on on anything and I just it like broke my bank a little bit but I just made the
commitment and I was like fuck okay I'm gonna do it spent the money waited and it took like you
know three weeks to come in the mail and it was like I was on pins and needles the whole time
and then finally showed up and I was like damn this thing this thing is amazing and smaller than
I thought it seems to be a theme in my glass collecting career but you know ultimately smaller
is better especially if you're if you're dabbing quality turps you want you want that flavor
preservation and the larger larger vessels don't tend to preserve flavor quite as well I would
have big-ass banger well yeah I mean that kind of changes things to these days that the tech the
dab tech is is a lot different yeah I don't know where I'm going with that otherwise but
start of the case a case well so I actually broke my first a K which is like the most heartbreaking
shit to say and that happened in 2008 for 2009 I had it in my hand for 72 hours and I was
just like I was just too confident I guess and I went to get a new diffuser made and I had one
made that was like slightly too large a gauge for the bushing that I had chosen the the grommet
that I had chosen and I just tried to like muscle it in there and yeah like Jameson I know I could
see it in your face like yeah like I just I tried to like wedge it in there and it just like
we whipped off a little plate of glass and spider web the crap and I was like oh no and then it was
ultimately I'm not even against the rest of story because it's even more like I don't need I'm gonna
get really pissed off myself but like it's ended up broken and then I had like the curse of a K
for like two years after that maybe like 18 months after that where like I sent out money like
dollars for a senior Rita an AK senior Rita was the style I think there was like three or four
made and I'm pretty sure it's a senior Rita because Sarah worked on them or did the majority that work
or did the I don't know I could be wrong I would actually love to know the story I think that's it
I think that's what I remember I tried to jump on one of those and the tube never came I sent the
money in the tube never came and then the guy came out as a scammer in the forum like later
on and it was like fuck like I just straight-up got taken this dude posted up a picture of like
someone else's work pretty much in like took me to be a verified someone like vouch for this dude
to get in the back somehow and then like he just he scammed he scammed me scammed called other
people and then it was some bullshit and then I I just couldn't like you know get my hands on
the tube anytime one was posted it was like I didn't have the funds couldn't work it or like
it was already taken before there and then finally finally I got one locally and it was
I have it down I heard downstairs I'll bring it out another show it's my finger burner so it's
like 11 inches tall there's two one of two and that was like my first a.k.a. and that was like
I paid 750 or 800 Canadian for it and at that point it was like still a lot of money right
still now it's worth considerably more so RJ so what are we looking forward to like happen in the
shows like what what can people look forward to next week or the following week after that like
people come in here chat about I want to say thanks everyone for like sticking around if
they've made it this far and just listening to us fucking ramble about everything like so many
different topics today and we kind of had a loose idea what we wanted to talk about and it's went
to shit so thanks everyone for sticking around honestly like we're gonna we're gonna tighten the
shit up a little bit but still keep it heavy into the dabs and maybe structure it more a bit into
to the glass and extracts a lot of things or maybe just break into segments and I don't
fucking know but I don't know I've had a lot of fun I hope everyone else has had a good time too
because this is some more rosin and some more rosin makers and maybe some yeah we'd love that's
that's what we want to do that's the plan we kind of wanted to set it up like we would just have
our normal face times because like we just hang out like this normally on like this time or just
like dabbing and talking shit shit talk about fireman and bring some people on right like we
we got enough going on between the three of us I can go into like I'm not here to promote my
company but I go deep into the extraction game like I'm deeply ingrained into pretty much
everything extraction that's that's my main focus at my job I'm I'm directly responsible for all the
hash we put out and all the hydrocarbon stuff we put out as well as I optimize other processes
so like I know and have a deep understanding of pretty much everything extraction so I like would
be more than happy to talk about how we make everything how people get products to market
you know I won't go into people's tech because I don't know everyone's tech but I'll you know how
loosely things are made right not too much about how our products are made I'll kind of generalize
it as well but definitely want to talk more about glass glass history because like these like
there's so much more to glass history than people understand and things have evolved so fucking much
and I just really want people to understand kind of where we've come from because it's a deep glass
history and it's super fucking cool and dab culture and extracts is tied into that so perfectly
and I mean I I'm gonna try to bring on some other people that have been in it as long as I have to
Brian's been Brian's one of my best friends he's been kind of alongside me for this journey the
whole time so he's been he's been able to see the whole evolution with me and see my evolution
so we can talk about kind of like our own personal histories a bit more too
and I'm gonna also bring on some of my more some more of my glass and I'll do like a glass show
until I'll try to do maybe different pieces every week for a little bit until I run out or
maybe do different segments on on fun shit and then if we can bring on some guests
I think that would be dope and and we can get into some cool stuff with them as well so
it's just going to basically be like a bunch of a bunch of us just hanging out getting high
talking and bringing you guys along for the conversation so much love I mean you guys
covered some fucking awesome shit today I mean what a conversation we've had we've covered like
some of the legal cannabis market the evolution of like hydrocarbon extraction and what you've
done over the last few years I mean it's been a really awesome conversation you know if there's
anybody out there in the I want to run through it sorry I cut you off a little bit there with my
mind no it's I just we just touched on the front end kind of like how we got open blasting up to
like we didn't even really touch on it to be honest like I can run us through it I can run us
through the whole history of how this all this shit went down and as well as some major players
involved and then kind of how dab culture evolved alongside and then like I was talking about
earlier the the the switch from people you know making their their shatter or their wax at home
open blasting to rosin because you know it is much safer now people have quality
in a better way now they understand well I'm using water I'm using heat I'm using ice like
it's like this is how I can extract and it's it's opened a lot of people's eyes a lot of people that
would never want to go the butane route and now you know they feel safe because now they know
what's in their extraction or they're in in their extracts and their concentrates and with these
these water extractions you know it is obviously much safer than using a canned gas
albeit like we were talking earlier you know water out of your your garden hose may not be the best
you know focus on focus on your inputs quality of the ice quality of the water
quality of the gas quality of your your bags you know quality of your steel filters
filter media if you're if you're doing you know crc or any form of like make sure it's
always fire fire is fire fire please I love you all thanks everyone thanks everyone awesome guys
