[00:02.750 --> 00:08.030]  And you pronounce your last name and Jason and recent yep close cool
[00:09.510 --> 00:11.510]  You guys related
[00:12.310 --> 00:14.910]  You and mark no, I wish
[00:16.550 --> 00:18.030]  He could
[00:18.030 --> 00:22.910]  He could fund all your projects. Yeah, I actually have a tech bound tech background
[00:22.910 --> 00:29.750]  I was a programmer network engineer for 15 years before I finally moved over to cannabis for good
[00:30.150 --> 00:37.510]  Got it. All right. Well, we are now live. Welcome everybody to the James loud show episode number three
[00:38.510 --> 00:40.670]  featuring finest cannabis and
[00:41.310 --> 00:43.870]  Take it away James. How's it going everybody?
[00:45.510 --> 00:49.190]  Welcome to week three of the James loud show and today we have
[00:49.830 --> 00:52.390]  Christian Andreessen from finest and
[00:53.150 --> 00:57.350]  He's gonna be giving us a little bit about their background. I have a lot of history with finest
[00:57.910 --> 01:04.190]  The late Jay Malloy and I were kind of talking about doing some breeding stuff right before he passed with
[01:04.750 --> 01:05.990]  autoflower
[01:05.990 --> 01:11.190]  So I thought it'd be great to have them on the show this week and kind of talk about what they're doing now
[01:11.230 --> 01:14.950]  You know what they've done and what you know Christian's experience in the industry
[01:15.790 --> 01:23.070]  So let's get started. So how long have you been in the industry Christian? And can you talk about your history with cannabis?
[01:23.990 --> 01:25.030]  Yeah
[01:25.070 --> 01:30.070]  Thanks, thanks James, I appreciate I've been running your gear for for a long time
[01:30.830 --> 01:33.630]  Actually, you know hunting some of the new stuff that you just passed along
[01:34.390 --> 01:36.390]  so I appreciate it and
[01:36.910 --> 01:41.030]  Yeah, my experience with cannabis. I grew up in upstate, New York
[01:42.110 --> 01:46.150]  You know back then, you know been using cannabis since I was a teenager
[01:47.150 --> 01:49.150]  back then I was always
[01:50.150 --> 01:53.670]  You know, then it was brick read we always had
[01:53.670 --> 02:00.630]  You know stems and seeds and we're always popping seeds and trying to hide them through properties and and things like that
[02:00.630 --> 02:04.750]  So I've always you know had a long long history with it
[02:05.390 --> 02:09.190]  Commercially, I've been cultivating cannabis for for over 10 years
[02:11.070 --> 02:16.910]  Growing, you know started in in garages. I've been in California for for about 20 years
[02:17.070 --> 02:22.230]  I remember the first the first grow I saw was in a friend's
[02:22.870 --> 02:27.430]  bedroom his older brother and I thought you know the feds were about to bust in and
[02:28.110 --> 02:33.870]  Kick the door and take us all away. It was coming from New York. It was definitely a different, you know different time
[02:33.870 --> 02:36.590]  I was like 2000 or 2001
[02:37.950 --> 02:39.190]  and so, you know
[02:39.190 --> 02:46.310]  I got I started getting a lot of friends where we're either supplementing their income or or moving up to Mendocino or Humboldt to
[02:46.310 --> 02:49.190]  You know to to start growing commercially
[02:49.190 --> 02:57.550]  So, you know, I started in you know, one garage and in in in truckie and and that just kept growing and growing
[02:58.870 --> 03:00.870]  throughout the years
[03:01.070 --> 03:03.070]  me and Jay
[03:03.110 --> 03:05.110]  partnered on a
[03:05.230 --> 03:11.070]  facility a piece of property and that was kind of when we we went from the indoor scene to the
[03:11.190 --> 03:14.990]  To the greenhouse scene from there we we built
[03:15.870 --> 03:20.750]  Every year we it seemed like we just kept on doubling down on properties and just expanding
[03:21.670 --> 03:24.230]  you know kind of honing in our skills and and
[03:25.230 --> 03:28.510]  You know getting better and better as the years went by
[03:30.150 --> 03:32.150]  Nice
[03:33.430 --> 03:37.830]  Excellent and that sounds awesome. So what what year did you transition over to California?
[03:37.950 --> 03:39.950]  I've been in California since
[03:41.110 --> 03:42.590]  2000
[03:42.590 --> 03:44.590]  So what's the best part about?
[03:45.110 --> 03:49.470]  conversion from going from the traditional black market to the white market
[03:51.110 --> 03:54.230]  You know, I think for me it's like you you're able to
[03:55.070 --> 03:59.750]  Specialize in whatever you do that you're best at whereas like in the black market
[03:59.750 --> 04:04.350]  You kind of had to be a man of all hats where you know, you had to be able to do electricity
[04:04.390 --> 04:06.390]  All these things because
[04:06.470 --> 04:12.950]  It was it was pretty scary at times to hire help. What's your it was it was I was I was definitely
[04:12.950 --> 04:17.990]  Yeah, you know a jack-of-all-trades. I can still wire 110 and 240 with the best of them
[04:17.990 --> 04:24.470]  I mean ever wanted, you know that many people and in your facilities and stuff like that, you know for me
[04:25.390 --> 04:28.310]  You know, I I married with a couple kids
[04:28.990 --> 04:34.310]  I had a wife and I had a son and I had a daughter and I had a son and I had a
[04:34.870 --> 04:36.870]  you know, there was a point where
[04:37.870 --> 04:44.750]  You know, we were I worked, you know, we grew and I lived in the same County and at one point
[04:45.630 --> 04:47.630]  the County was actually
[04:48.470 --> 04:50.470]  Decided not to license
[04:51.670 --> 04:53.670]  Commercial cannabis this was like
[04:54.150 --> 04:56.150]  in the MacArthur era
[04:56.310 --> 05:00.990]  And they actually banned it in the county and then ended up
[05:01.670 --> 05:05.270]  Putting to a vote for everybody in the county and
[05:06.030 --> 05:08.030]  we
[05:08.030 --> 05:10.030]  I kind of stuck my neck out
[05:10.550 --> 05:12.550]  Started getting involved politically
[05:13.550 --> 05:15.550]  At that time. We also got one of our
[05:16.430 --> 05:18.430]  facilities raided so
[05:19.550 --> 05:21.550]  You know, there was a point where you know
[05:22.030 --> 05:27.790]  We had you know sheriffs and stuff knocking on our door and and just kind of chasing us around. So I
[05:28.190 --> 05:33.630]  Think that's probably the you know, the best part of kind of coming, you know, kind of out of the shadows is is
[05:34.190 --> 05:38.190]  Not worrying, you know, there was a point where I had to call my wife and you know
[05:38.190 --> 05:40.670]  Tell her to leave the house with the children, you know, so
[05:42.030 --> 05:46.950]  That's probably the best part, you know that I see over the you know
[05:46.950 --> 05:51.390]  The transition from you know, the 215 market and to you know, the prop 64
[05:52.350 --> 05:53.630]  nice
[05:53.870 --> 05:58.230]  Nice so what were your favorite strains back then?
[06:00.350 --> 06:02.350]  Cultivation and for smoking
[06:03.230 --> 06:08.230]  Cultivation actually I ran your seven-eight sour for a long time and anyone that you know dealt with me in this
[06:08.790 --> 06:11.270]  the 215 days if you could have a
[06:11.790 --> 06:16.030]  You know sour diesel that finished in in eight weeks. You were you were pretty good
[06:16.670 --> 06:18.670]  So I ran a lot of that
[06:18.950 --> 06:22.030]  I did some breeding and a lot of female hunting
[06:22.430 --> 06:25.870]  Back then I I was lucky enough to
[06:26.990 --> 06:28.870]  to get
[06:28.870 --> 06:32.190]  the the early cut of the cookies
[06:33.030 --> 06:37.310]  you know Tahoe was kind of a funny place because you know when the
[06:37.790 --> 06:43.230]  made a lot of connections and Mendocino and Humboldt guys as they would crop out they would come here and and
[06:44.110 --> 06:48.870]  and ski and snowboard for the season and you know ended up making a lot of friends and
[06:48.950 --> 06:54.670]  In relationships and I was always able to you know, kind of get the best genetics
[06:54.670 --> 06:59.530]  You know source the best genetics and and it's still you know to this day
[06:59.530 --> 07:04.830]  It's I still have a lot of connections up there and a lot of the stuff that we put out commercially is still you know
[07:04.830 --> 07:06.830]  source through some of these networks
[07:06.870 --> 07:08.310]  I
[07:08.310 --> 07:12.590]  And I always loved, you know sour diesels and in
[07:13.230 --> 07:14.350]  chems
[07:14.350 --> 07:15.350]  I
[07:15.350 --> 07:20.750]  Just liked a little more uppity high rather than you know, kind of the sitting back on the couch
[07:22.030 --> 07:23.670]  nice
[07:23.670 --> 07:24.870]  So a lot of you know
[07:24.870 --> 07:26.230]  We still breed with a lot of those
[07:26.230 --> 07:31.590]  Years initial cuts one of the one of the best things about tissue culture is that we're able to kind of turn back the clock
[07:31.790 --> 07:39.110]  On a lot of these genetics, you know, the chem the chem dog that we use and a lot of our breeding and commercial
[07:41.230 --> 07:43.230]  Cultivation is something that was
[07:43.910 --> 07:48.670]  You know ran within our group for you know, probably 10-15 years
[07:53.430 --> 07:58.790]  Yeah, it's a sour diesel that I I feno hunted
[08:00.350 --> 08:01.790]  probably
[08:01.790 --> 08:03.670]  Six or seven years ago
[08:03.670 --> 08:06.870]  with some some friends up in up on Mendocino that
[08:07.350 --> 08:09.110]  had the
[08:09.110 --> 08:12.590]  original like East Coast sour diesel, you know was brought over in a little
[08:13.550 --> 08:15.550]  a little cooler and
[08:16.870 --> 08:21.910]  You know had a lot of good friends up there that were were great breeders and and just kept on
[08:22.230 --> 08:24.990]  you know back crossing it and stabilizing it and
[08:25.830 --> 08:27.470]  I
[08:27.470 --> 08:33.710]  Actually found that one and it's funny because it never really grew like a sour diesel
[08:33.710 --> 08:37.470]  I had plenty of people that would come and purchase, you know
[08:37.470 --> 08:38.910]  sour diesel from me and
[08:38.910 --> 08:43.470]  They would look at it the bag and just kind of laugh and like this isn't sour diesel and I was like
[08:43.470 --> 08:47.030]  I go ahead and open it and then you know, the smell would hit you
[08:48.110 --> 08:50.950]  But that cut special it's you know for sour diesel
[08:50.950 --> 08:58.590]  It's it's not as the the period is not as long but it's got a lot tighter bud structure
[08:58.950 --> 09:03.950]  But it really has that you know that sour diesel funk to it. Nice
[09:04.150 --> 09:10.750]  Awesome man, well, do you want to share a little bit about the history of finest and how you started working with Jay and
[09:11.270 --> 09:16.430]  Back in the day or yeah, I think yeah, I think it's important to kind of you know, the the
[09:17.390 --> 09:23.950]  Finest was definitely, you know, the the idea was definitely a collaboration between you know, all of us us three
[09:25.870 --> 09:27.870]  Like I said, I grew and
[09:28.630 --> 09:30.630]  in truckie for years and
[09:30.630 --> 09:34.390]  Kind of hold my skills in that way Jay was actually
[09:35.390 --> 09:38.590]  Jay and Bo both were kind of wrapped up in a
[09:41.390 --> 09:42.390]  A
[09:42.390 --> 09:47.390]  They caught a case and in Butte County Jay was from Iowa
[09:47.910 --> 09:49.910]  He ended up moving to Mendocino
[09:50.110 --> 09:55.270]  He dropped out of college in LA and went up north started trimming and in
[09:55.270 --> 09:58.350]  He was in Butte County him and him and Bo and some other
[09:59.270 --> 10:02.310]  you know lifelong friends had been growing there and
[10:03.070 --> 10:04.590]  you know, they
[10:04.590 --> 10:06.590]  Ended up getting wrapped up in a case
[10:08.310 --> 10:14.750]  They both spent a little time inside after that, you know Jay and Bo had moved to
[10:15.830 --> 10:19.230]  To Santa Cruz where I had where I had a little bit of a job
[10:19.350 --> 10:22.030]  You know Jay and Bo had moved to
[10:23.110 --> 10:26.030]  To Santa Cruz where I had some where I have some family
[10:27.150 --> 10:28.830]  in
[10:28.830 --> 10:30.830]  Jay
[10:30.830 --> 10:33.230]  and my cousin became really good friends and
[10:35.470 --> 10:38.590]  It was funny I had like I said, I had one of the first original
[10:39.310 --> 10:41.310]  estimate cuts Jay would always
[10:41.830 --> 10:44.950]  Bug my cousin for that cutting. I just I would never give it up
[10:45.790 --> 10:47.790]  and we kind of
[10:48.110 --> 10:51.350]  Developed a friendship in in those years and
[10:53.590 --> 10:58.270]  We both were we're trying to look for you know, kind of the next move and
[11:00.390 --> 11:02.990]  Both Jay and I had spent some time in
[11:03.830 --> 11:08.270]  the foothills like Nevada City grass grass valley area of
[11:09.470 --> 11:17.070]  Little outside of Sacramento. So we ended up purchasing a first property together and that's kind of where we started to you know
[11:17.790 --> 11:19.950]  to grow in greenhouses and
[11:21.070 --> 11:24.910]  you know Jay was kind of the mastermind of
[11:26.310 --> 11:28.750]  the marketing side of you know, our
[11:29.990 --> 11:36.350]  Our company we you know at that time it was, you know, the 215 scripts was was a big thing
[11:36.350 --> 11:39.830]  So we decided to you know, start a brand
[11:41.430 --> 11:43.270]  And Jay came up with the name
[11:43.270 --> 11:48.990]  It's funny a lot of people would always ask him if it was if he was a big fish fan and I would always laugh because
[11:49.510 --> 11:53.950]  He never really cared for fish. He was more of you know, 90s hip-hop
[11:55.030 --> 12:01.110]  But you know the name started with the the pH was for the possible hydrogen of the water
[12:02.390 --> 12:07.910]  So, you know, we started the brand and we started, you know, kind of running around
[12:08.710 --> 12:11.190]  California and high times cups and
[12:11.230 --> 12:15.070]  You know all of the events, you know back in those days and
[12:16.230 --> 12:21.950]  You know started to get a little following and meeting a lot of people, you know, a lot of the big
[12:23.910 --> 12:26.550]  The 215 dispensaries back then
[12:27.710 --> 12:34.310]  You know started to actually package and try to you know, we kind of saw where it was going and we tried to stay ahead of it
[12:34.430 --> 12:41.910]  You know at that time about five years ago as licenses started to come on like I said like we we weren't able to
[12:42.990 --> 12:44.990]  The properties that we had at that time
[12:45.550 --> 12:51.430]  We weren't able to license anything. So we started to sell off those properties and kind of started chasing
[12:52.310 --> 12:54.310]  chasing
[12:54.310 --> 12:57.830]  chasing licenses around the around the state and then we kind of
[12:58.630 --> 13:01.590]  Ultimately ended up, you know find ourselves in the state
[13:02.470 --> 13:05.750]  Ultimately ended up, you know finders are way back to
[13:06.630 --> 13:10.870]  to Sacramento and that's kind of where we you know, we landed and
[13:11.470 --> 13:13.630]  we started with an indoor pro and
[13:14.390 --> 13:17.070]  you know that kind of snowballed into
[13:18.430 --> 13:20.830]  you know meeting a group that we
[13:22.350 --> 13:26.630]  Work with now on on the tissue culture side of things and
[13:27.670 --> 13:30.150]  you know now we have a
[13:30.590 --> 13:32.590]  Two acre
[13:33.070 --> 13:36.270]  Light depth hoop house out in Yolo County
[13:37.310 --> 13:39.310]  so that's kind of the
[13:40.150 --> 13:46.510]  50,000 square foot view of how how the company started and how we started working together
[13:48.230 --> 13:50.030]  Awesome
[13:50.030 --> 13:53.910]  Yeah, Jay man. It's really sad. It's been a little over a year and
[13:54.550 --> 13:57.070]  You know, he had such a big impact on people's lives
[13:57.070 --> 14:01.990]  I think in on the industry and tissue culture you guys were kind of the first people to
[14:02.550 --> 14:06.350]  Really scale the tissue culture model. In fact, nobody's really done it like you guys
[14:07.390 --> 14:11.270]  There's a lot of people that do tissue culture, but you guys have really taken it to another level
[14:11.950 --> 14:13.950]  Yeah, I appreciate that
[14:13.950 --> 14:15.830]  Yeah, it's
[14:15.830 --> 14:17.830]  You know, I still run into people
[14:18.830 --> 14:24.110]  That stop me and talk about Jay's impact he had on them personally or
[14:25.110 --> 14:26.870]  through business
[14:26.870 --> 14:28.070]  and
[14:28.070 --> 14:33.830]  You know, I think that's a true sediment to the type of person he was and and you know
[14:34.630 --> 14:40.350]  He had a real passion for for the plant and you know kind of breaking some of these
[14:41.830 --> 14:45.470]  These negative connotations that you know has been surrounded by
[14:46.190 --> 14:48.190]  By the plant for so long and
[14:49.550 --> 14:53.150]  It's uh, yeah, it's great to see I was actually on the phone with
[14:53.990 --> 15:00.750]  with John from from cutting-edge on Friday, and he was just in Oklahoma and and you know, there's
[15:01.990 --> 15:05.910]  There's people out there running some of our gear and just you know still
[15:06.350 --> 15:09.910]  you know have nothing but great things to say about Jay and and
[15:10.390 --> 15:13.990]  You know, you're kind of seeing you know his legacy past, you know
[15:14.470 --> 15:21.230]  Across across the nation right now as these new areas pop up and it's it's pretty cool to see
[15:22.470 --> 15:26.710]  Totally. Yeah, so let's talk about some TC for a little bit. Sure
[15:27.630 --> 15:31.190]  So how is TC evolved over the last 10 years?
[15:31.950 --> 15:36.430]  You know from where you guys first started, you know, how did you guys get started with the TC?
[15:37.110 --> 15:39.030]  you know, um
[15:39.030 --> 15:40.590]  so about
[15:40.590 --> 15:42.590]  about nine years ago, um
[15:43.270 --> 15:46.030]  One of my first grows I was grown, you know
[15:46.030 --> 15:53.190]  I had like I said, I had that that thin mint cut and I used to bring it down to San Jose to a
[15:53.590 --> 15:55.870]  Dispensary down there. They would buy everything I could grow
[15:57.470 --> 16:02.790]  One time I brought it down there and I'm on my way back up to Tahoe and they call me and they're like man
[16:02.790 --> 16:07.990]  This is just a ton of seeds in here. And I was like, you know, I didn't see any of them
[16:08.510 --> 16:13.270]  And so, you know, we kind of talked worked through it and then the next couple rounds
[16:13.270 --> 16:17.990]  I kept on getting seeds and I couldn't figure out why it wasn't you know, there was there was no bananas
[16:17.990 --> 16:24.510]  There was no male flowers and I just you know at that time everybody, you know, really communicated over
[16:25.350 --> 16:27.350]  over chats over, you know
[16:28.670 --> 16:33.390]  Over the old forums and I started looking around trying to figure out
[16:33.870 --> 16:37.790]  You know how to fix this and I actually came across Bill Graham
[16:39.190 --> 16:46.710]  Bill Graham was always pushing TC and in cannabis, you know for for the past couple decades
[16:47.550 --> 16:50.230]  At one point he started selling, you know TC
[16:50.910 --> 16:56.730]  Starter kits. I purchased one of those and I think out of like 200, you know
[16:57.310 --> 17:01.310]  cuts I took like maybe one or two actually made it through and and and
[17:04.390 --> 17:10.430]  Didn't get infected or you know, and like I said that time I was it was in a garage
[17:10.430 --> 17:13.070]  So it wasn't the most sterile of environments, you know
[17:13.070 --> 17:18.470]  but just trying to really figure figure this out and really dove into the science behind it and
[17:18.830 --> 17:23.630]  You know, my my idea was if I could figure out how to to get this through culture
[17:23.630 --> 17:30.110]  I could kind of you know, reset the the genetic and some of the traits that I was starting to see some of the
[17:30.790 --> 17:35.230]  Some of the issues I was having with that plant, you know, I had no luck
[17:36.190 --> 17:38.870]  failed pretty miserably at that point, you know, but
[17:40.030 --> 17:45.710]  Was something I was always in the back of my head, you know, and you fast forward a couple years
[17:46.470 --> 17:48.470]  When we started to develop
[17:49.430 --> 17:51.430]  some of our facilities in
[17:51.870 --> 17:53.670]  Sacramento
[17:53.670 --> 17:55.910]  It was just kind of something that came up was like what?
[17:56.350 --> 18:03.150]  What's one thing that nobody's really doing in the industry and you know, I said, you know TC and
[18:03.670 --> 18:09.030]  one of the issues at that time I was watching a lot of friends and Salinas and
[18:09.630 --> 18:13.230]  You know some of the bigger commercial spaces that came online first
[18:13.910 --> 18:17.350]  all the flowers passing testing but as
[18:18.030 --> 18:22.750]  They started to concentrate, you know, you saw a lot of pesticides pop up
[18:23.270 --> 18:26.790]  So honestly, we kind of went down the path to
[18:27.230 --> 18:33.390]  To clean up our genetics because you know back then we were always sharing them and we'd always get them back
[18:33.390 --> 18:36.630]  You didn't know what people were spraying on on those plants
[18:37.230 --> 18:44.710]  You know and you know, we wanted to make sure that we started with the cleanest best best genetic and it was
[18:45.230 --> 18:48.150]  Honestly, it was just for for our in-house
[18:49.070 --> 18:51.190]  Use we we had no, you know
[18:52.190 --> 18:56.670]  The desire to be a nursery I mean nurseries were really even a viable option back then
[18:57.470 --> 18:59.470]  So we started down that path
[19:00.310 --> 19:02.430]  We met, you know TC
[19:04.230 --> 19:06.530]  Company in outside of Sacramento that
[19:07.990 --> 19:10.270]  It's been in the traditional AG
[19:11.510 --> 19:13.510]  industry for the past 30 years
[19:13.870 --> 19:18.670]  on TC and and we formed a great partnership with them and
[19:19.590 --> 19:25.790]  It was funny our project in Yolo County we kept on hitting, you know roadblocks and
[19:26.510 --> 19:30.590]  We couldn't get that facility online quick enough
[19:31.110 --> 19:32.750]  So at one point, you know
[19:32.750 --> 19:38.110]  All these plants started to like back up on us and me and Jay just kind of looked at each other and like what do?
[19:38.110 --> 19:42.430]  We do with these plants. I'm like, I guess we have to sell them, you know, I don't want to throw them out
[19:42.430 --> 19:46.390]  And so that's actually how the nursery nursery started
[19:47.070 --> 19:53.830]  We started selling plants at that time, like I said, there was you know, there was no there was no nursery licenses
[19:53.830 --> 19:55.830]  And that wasn't really a big
[19:55.990 --> 20:00.310]  Part of the industry like it is today, you know, you had a you know
[20:00.310 --> 20:05.590]  Nobody wanted to give up their genetics and nobody wanted to you know to have those genetics
[20:06.150 --> 20:11.310]  Or someone someone else they didn't want to really rely on you to supply those genetics
[20:11.910 --> 20:14.910]  So it was definitely, you know a big
[20:15.630 --> 20:19.910]  Learning curve for us and it was you know, that was something that Jay really tackled
[20:20.750 --> 20:22.790]  You know, we ended up some of our first plants
[20:22.790 --> 20:25.910]  We actually gave away and told people to run side-by-side comparisons
[20:25.910 --> 20:32.310]  We had been running them for a while and understood what what what those plants could do and the difference
[20:33.270 --> 20:35.270]  you know, you get a lot of the
[20:35.510 --> 20:37.830]  juvenile vigor and branching
[20:38.870 --> 20:40.870]  you get a lot of
[20:41.870 --> 20:47.790]  Just a lot of traits that you don't see after you clone a plant or a mother plant for a period of time
[20:48.510 --> 20:54.630]  You know, the the term genetic drift is thrown around, you know out there. It's you know, it's not
[20:55.390 --> 21:01.630]  Not I wouldn't say it's it's it's what's happening like because I don't think we're really, you know altering the DNA
[21:01.630 --> 21:08.490]  But you see, you know, just a lot of recessive traits. You see them starting to get beat up
[21:09.050 --> 21:11.050]  With bugs and and
[21:13.090 --> 21:18.730]  And then you have the pesticide issues and and in viruses and by roads that are now starting to pop up
[21:19.130 --> 21:23.090]  So, you know TC we we gave a lot of these plants out
[21:23.170 --> 21:28.170]  You know a lot of the people in Mendocino and Humboldt that you know, like they were seed growers
[21:28.170 --> 21:31.370]  they they they didn't you know, they didn't believe in clones and
[21:32.370 --> 21:37.090]  You know started giving them out and then we had people coming back to us being like wow
[21:37.090 --> 21:41.850]  I need more of that. You know, I that that plant was like outperforming some of my seeds and
[21:42.370 --> 21:44.370]  that's kind of you know, how
[21:45.070 --> 21:49.330]  we kind of evolved into a you know, TC nursery and
[21:49.970 --> 21:51.890]  You know, it's kind of still what's you know
[21:51.890 --> 21:56.330]  what's pushing us today is is trying to get as much information and
[21:56.730 --> 21:59.650]  data out there to the to the cultivators to
[22:00.690 --> 22:02.690]  You know to everybody
[22:03.250 --> 22:06.390]  To understand, you know the true benefits of TC
[22:07.770 --> 22:12.050]  Over, you know traditional cloning, you know, and I think you know
[22:13.210 --> 22:16.130]  TC will be a long-term solution
[22:17.290 --> 22:20.650]  because as as the industry grows as the
[22:21.770 --> 22:24.690]  Scalability is, you know, just getting bigger and bigger
[22:26.250 --> 22:30.870]  We're gonna see more and more viruses more and more, you know issues starting to pop up
[22:31.450 --> 22:36.730]  as as this, you know as this industry scales and I think you know
[22:37.210 --> 22:40.210]  Long-term TC is going to be you know, the real
[22:41.210 --> 22:43.530]  the real pathway to you know, keeping
[22:44.230 --> 22:48.530]  Genetics clean and getting the healthiest start you can every every time
[22:50.570 --> 22:52.810]  Awesome man, that's that's great
[22:53.530 --> 22:59.890]  So let's talk about some old clonal variation, you know, what's your opinion on it? What's your experience with it?
[23:00.930 --> 23:02.930]  You want to describe it a little bit first?
[23:03.450 --> 23:10.450]  Yeah, I mean so there's there's there's different forms of TC you have you know, you have no toll you have Marist M
[23:10.450 --> 23:12.410]  You have callus
[23:12.410 --> 23:15.970]  We don't have a lot of experience with with that form
[23:16.370 --> 23:18.210]  a
[23:18.210 --> 23:22.330]  lot of people don't like to talk about it, but you know TC there's always a
[23:23.330 --> 23:29.770]  slight chance of mutation that occurs, you know and with callus that is actually
[23:30.530 --> 23:32.530]  more likely to happen
[23:32.930 --> 23:39.850]  So, you know, there's a lot of studies that have been done in strawberries and other agricultural crops
[23:40.130 --> 23:46.770]  So we've kind of always steered away from that. We do you know, we do Marist M especially now we're we're doing a lot of
[23:48.050 --> 23:51.990]  Tests on how to remove the hoplite and byroid, you know
[23:51.990 --> 23:59.010]  And the Marist M is really coming into into into play there and then you know, nodal is kind of what we really do
[24:00.010 --> 24:04.810]  That's you know the most stable and in the best form of
[24:05.930 --> 24:12.610]  TC that we've been you know, we've been running and then that turns into the micro propagation like you said that there's there's a lot of
[24:14.570 --> 24:17.930]  TC labs that have popped up, you know in the last couple years and
[24:18.690 --> 24:22.550]  you know, it's important to understand the different types of
[24:23.550 --> 24:29.030]  TC that's out there, you know, I'll never talk bad about competition or anything like that
[24:29.030 --> 24:35.270]  but you know, it's there's there's there's different, you know, very loosely used terms and and
[24:36.910 --> 24:44.590]  Things kind of thrown out there right now and it's just really important to to understand, you know the process, you know
[24:45.910 --> 24:48.030]  There's what we call kind of a quick rinse
[24:48.030 --> 24:52.950]  Which a lot of TC labs are doing they kind of bring the plant into culture real quick
[24:53.630 --> 24:56.810]  They'll kind of do a sterilization process, you know
[24:56.810 --> 25:00.710]  that might get rid of a pest or you know a pathogen real quick and and
[25:01.230 --> 25:04.390]  you know kind of give back to the cultivator to to
[25:06.830 --> 25:10.630]  To mother and take some take some stock off of that
[25:11.750 --> 25:17.110]  Which is which is great, you know, you're seeing you know, like a some rejuvenation of that plant
[25:17.390 --> 25:21.750]  But I think what makes us different is, you know, the process that we're doing
[25:22.270 --> 25:26.790]  Really brings back those juvenile trades. It's the health and vigor that you get is
[25:28.070 --> 25:30.070]  Every time time in and time out
[25:31.030 --> 25:33.030]  You know the uniformity of the clone
[25:33.670 --> 25:38.190]  is something that you know kind of has put us out out ahead of the game and
[25:38.870 --> 25:45.910]  You know, it's with all these new viruses and stuff that are starting to pop up, you know big ag will you know?
[25:46.030 --> 25:50.670]  History will you know will tell you that at some point we're going to be you know
[25:51.110 --> 25:54.230]  decimated by by some sort of superbug or or
[25:54.670 --> 25:59.270]  Or pathogen and you know, I think we're starting to see the very
[25:59.950 --> 26:02.390]  beginnings of that with hoplite and viroid and
[26:04.710 --> 26:08.830]  You know, it's very important like all of our stock is is tested
[26:10.310 --> 26:14.030]  Continuously, you know everything that we're putting out commercially, you know
[26:14.110 --> 26:17.310]  Can be followed up by you know testing
[26:24.590 --> 26:29.470]  No, we use a third-party lab a very big agricultural lab
[26:30.550 --> 26:32.350]  they do
[26:32.350 --> 26:39.470]  Testing for agricultural crops or actually they do a lot of testing for like Monsanto and Dow on seed production and stuff like that
[26:40.310 --> 26:43.150]  There you know, they can their sequencing the DNA
[26:45.030 --> 26:49.070]  So, yeah, we we use that luckily they're not far from Sacramento
[26:49.470 --> 26:54.270]  They've identified I think about 40 different viruses and viroids
[26:54.270 --> 27:00.750]  And so, you know anytime we take a commercial strain into culture will run it
[27:01.310 --> 27:07.230]  Through them and then they can you know, they they will let us know if there's there's any issues with that
[27:07.230 --> 27:12.310]  And then again, we also test, you know periodically throughout the whole process
[27:13.310 --> 27:15.630]  You know TC is is kind of a
[27:17.990 --> 27:22.710]  Kind of what what you put in is what you're going to get out it's a it's kind of a closed-loop system
[27:23.230 --> 27:24.350]  so
[27:24.350 --> 27:27.670]  We're confident as that as that plant goes in
[27:28.830 --> 27:35.390]  You know the processes and that are that go on in a TC lab, you know
[27:35.710 --> 27:37.710]  Any kind of mold could decimate
[27:38.110 --> 27:47.390]  Just decimate a lab so the these these processes that kind of come up, you know cleanliness and and how you actually
[27:48.790 --> 27:54.430]  Clone in the TC lab gives us the ability to you know, assure ourselves that as it comes out
[27:56.350 --> 28:03.350]  That plants going to be you know healthy it's going to be the same as it came in, you know, so I
[28:04.070 --> 28:10.750]  Think it's important, you know, like for for any commercial cultivator now to you know to ask to see that level of
[28:14.070 --> 28:18.750]  Due diligence being done by nurseries to make sure that you know, you're not
[28:19.510 --> 28:24.910]  Getting something that's infected, you know, the hoplite and viroid is like we're seeing at first
[28:24.910 --> 28:30.390]  We thought it was just you know passed from vectors passed from tools things like that, you know
[28:30.390 --> 28:37.910]  But it's definitely in watering systems now. It's in you know, it's being hand, you know, just moved around by by touch and
[28:38.670 --> 28:43.270]  You know, I've been to some farms that you know have been decimated by it
[28:43.270 --> 28:46.130]  I was at a friend's farm a couple weeks ago and you know
[28:46.130 --> 28:50.630]  He's planted in the ground, you know kind of row crop style and you can just see you know
[28:50.670 --> 28:54.110]  one whole row just decimated by by this
[28:55.270 --> 28:57.270]  you know by this by Roy and
[28:58.070 --> 28:59.670]  You know
[28:59.670 --> 29:03.870]  It's been around for a while if you've grown for long enough like when you start seeing it now
[29:04.830 --> 29:12.470]  You can you you can understand that, you know, it's it's been around in our our strains and our genetics for quite a while
[29:13.950 --> 29:16.070]  but as we as
[29:16.870 --> 29:22.310]  We grow and as we expand, you know as the industry expands or you're seeing more and more
[29:22.350 --> 29:27.670]  You know expression of this and I'm watching farmers get decimated by it, you know losing
[29:27.830 --> 29:33.430]  You know probably getting a third of you know, the yields and and usable flower that you know
[29:35.310 --> 29:37.310]  That they should be getting
[29:37.630 --> 29:41.670]  Yeah, I miss the days where we only had to worry about mites you shot, right?
[29:43.710 --> 29:45.710]  Like I said, it's you know, like
[29:46.390 --> 29:50.950]  Traditional AG tells us anything like the history is like it's just gonna get worse, you know
[29:50.950 --> 29:54.550]  So we're always trying to stay ahead of it trying to identify some of these issues
[29:54.550 --> 29:58.630]  And this is the biggest issue that I've you know that we've kind of come across so far is is
[29:59.270 --> 30:02.330]  Because it's at it's at the RNA level. It's not the DNA level
[30:02.330 --> 30:06.030]  So it's very very hard a lot of people are telling you you can get rid of it
[30:06.030 --> 30:12.870]  And you know the way it actually moves through the plant, you know, it might not express itself, you know right away
[30:13.350 --> 30:20.310]  So it's very important to be you know, growing some of these, you know cultivars out to to make sure that you really have a clean
[30:20.310 --> 30:22.310]  plant, you know, it's not just
[30:22.430 --> 30:28.470]  Yeah, like half the planet can express and the other half it can be healthy it's the weirdest thing I've ever seen in my life
[30:28.790 --> 30:33.850]  Yes, I mean, it's almost you know, you get a lot of also asymptomatic like we're finding
[30:34.030 --> 30:38.570]  You know some plants that are testing positive for it that you would never know it had it, you know
[30:38.570 --> 30:43.350]  So I think this is you know, we're still early on learning about this this viroid
[30:44.350 --> 30:50.150]  But like I said, it's gonna be here for a while and it's it's it's really affecting a lot of people so far
[30:50.630 --> 30:51.910]  So
[30:51.910 --> 31:00.350]  So just quickly James Rob in the chat said I've read there is an 8% hop late and vibrate transmission through seed
[31:00.630 --> 31:07.430]  Source dark heart. I'd like to know if this is true. What did the donor didn't have hop late and viroid but the mother did
[31:10.370 --> 31:12.370]  We're actually we're actually
[31:12.470 --> 31:14.590]  Seeing it being transmitted through seed
[31:14.590 --> 31:21.870]  There's you know seed stock that I've gotten and started pheno hunting and and you know, we see it starting to express itself
[31:22.590 --> 31:24.470]  and
[31:24.470 --> 31:29.530]  You know, so we take it into testing and and sure enough it does test for it
[31:29.530 --> 31:33.610]  I'm not sure about the percentages. I've read some of that, you know information
[31:34.070 --> 31:38.730]  From from dark heart that put out a little while ago because they were kind of you know
[31:38.730 --> 31:43.430]  One of the first to you know, kind of identify it they have they have a lot of good information out there
[31:43.990 --> 31:45.990]  On you know
[31:47.310 --> 31:52.070]  What it looks like and and you know, I know that they've been trying to get rid of it as well
[31:52.710 --> 31:55.390]  so yeah, there's um, there's
[31:56.630 --> 31:58.630]  Still seeing it past your seed
[31:58.990 --> 32:01.270]  Unfortunately again because it's at the RNA level
[32:01.790 --> 32:04.290]  the the lab that we work with
[32:04.750 --> 32:09.750]  the testing lab we work with that's one of the big things that they do on tomato and
[32:10.550 --> 32:14.790]  Tomato seeds and other you know traditional ag crops they are
[32:15.750 --> 32:19.270]  You know, they see it all sorts of byroids pass through seed
[32:21.150 --> 32:23.670]  Yeah, so have you guys successfully removed it like
[32:26.510 --> 32:31.950]  Not yet we're you know, we're on the path, you know, we're seeing the virus loads
[32:33.310 --> 32:35.510]  Being you know pushed down
[32:36.790 --> 32:38.670]  suppressed so
[32:38.710 --> 32:41.390]  You know, we're getting closer, but it's you know
[32:43.030 --> 32:47.710]  It's through Marist M and Marist M true Marist M, you know takes
[32:48.230 --> 32:53.470]  Eight months to a year, you know to really to really to get through
[32:53.470 --> 32:57.750]  You know, the Marist M is the very very tip of the newest plant growth
[32:59.030 --> 33:04.190]  You know, it's hasn't been you know, really it's not part of the vascular system yet
[33:04.190 --> 33:09.710]  So anything that you know any virus or viral is the load is is lower
[33:10.390 --> 33:11.710]  usually
[33:11.710 --> 33:15.710]  We have been seeing some some strains with super high
[33:17.910 --> 33:19.910]  Viroid levels, but
[33:20.030 --> 33:25.950]  We're getting there. We're getting closer. I think we're on the right path. We're seeing that path of the gen load
[33:26.470 --> 33:28.470]  Lowered
[33:28.510 --> 33:34.710]  Every you know, every time we're taking a Marist M and and we're doing some other treatments and stuff that
[33:35.270 --> 33:37.270]  So, you know, hopefully
[33:37.910 --> 33:44.150]  You know, hopefully in the next year or so. We'll be able to remove it. It's not gonna be quick and it's not going to be
[33:45.630 --> 33:49.150]  Cheap as a lot of a lot of labor put into that
[33:49.910 --> 33:51.230]  so
[33:51.230 --> 33:53.070]  Again, it's just you know
[33:53.070 --> 33:58.310]  Trying to find the ones the genetics that that don't have it and you know
[33:58.310 --> 34:01.230]  Trying to really keep them keep them clean and keep them safe
[34:02.870 --> 34:06.230]  Awesome so systematic bacterial infections
[34:07.990 --> 34:15.670]  You guys test for that as well, is that something that's tested for yeah. Yeah, we test like I said, we've there's been about 40 different
[34:17.350 --> 34:19.350]  40 different viruses that we
[34:19.750 --> 34:26.750]  The testing lab has identified and a lot of these we can we can remove pretty easily
[34:27.910 --> 34:31.030]  But then some of them will you know, we're required like a Marist M
[34:33.670 --> 34:35.670]  Process to them awesome
[34:37.030 --> 34:38.710]  So
[34:38.710 --> 34:42.950]  Yeah, it's a crazy thing man. Hop Layton is you know something I've never seen
[34:42.950 --> 34:47.710]  I mean, it's I've never seen anything like it nothing close. It's like and we started the sour diesel funny
[34:47.710 --> 34:54.230]  We were talking about that earlier. I believe the sour was the first thing to express hop Layton, you know in the early
[34:54.750 --> 35:00.470]  2000s 2004 maybe 2005 the quality of sour diesel went down dramatically
[35:00.470 --> 35:06.550]  Yeah, I would say that's probably due to hop Layton, you know, I don't know 100% but as far as breathing with it
[35:06.550 --> 35:09.750]  You know, there was a question of donor and receiver. We just don't know enough about it
[35:09.750 --> 35:16.430]  You know if you're gonna get more of the progeny with top late and if you use a different donor than receiver
[35:17.790 --> 35:23.550]  You know, but this is stuff we'll probably find out in the next couple years, you know, it's and then we'll have something new to worry about as well
[35:23.910 --> 35:26.150]  Yeah. Yeah. No, I definitely agree
[35:26.150 --> 35:31.310]  I mean, I remember, you know growing a lot of sours and in in the past like you definitely saw
[35:31.830 --> 35:39.030]  The rooting rate you saw the structure, you know, so it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's
[35:39.030 --> 35:45.910]  you know starting to deteriorate and just you know, the you start losing smell and you know, it just
[35:46.750 --> 35:52.590]  You know that plant just starts to deteriorate and as that that viroids more and more expressed
[35:52.590 --> 35:55.270]  It just it does a lot of damage to a plant
[35:56.070 --> 36:01.510]  When I've seen clones that one side by side one will be expressing it and one won't you'll have a sticky
[36:02.310 --> 36:06.410]  Amazing resinous plant and then the next one is like dry and just done it out
[36:07.090 --> 36:09.090]  Yeah, I've actually I've seen
[36:09.730 --> 36:12.970]  One plant actually, you know a couple branches
[36:12.970 --> 36:18.730]  I've seen this a lot on like full season outdoors where you know, maybe two or three branches will actually be
[36:19.210 --> 36:22.690]  Expressing it and it'll just you know, it'll just be dotted
[36:22.690 --> 36:24.810]  There's just nothing to that structure anymore
[36:24.810 --> 36:27.490]  but the rest of the plant is fine and
[36:27.970 --> 36:32.690]  You know and that's kind of that put us on the path of like how is this really being spread?
[36:32.970 --> 36:38.850]  You know and you know trying to kind of dig more into that where you know
[36:40.210 --> 36:42.210]  Where I think it's really
[36:42.890 --> 36:48.210]  Coming from you know human touch not just like I said, not just the tools of vectors
[36:48.210 --> 36:51.970]  but you know human touch as people are moving around their gardens and and
[36:52.530 --> 36:55.490]  You know working on one plant to another, you know, like
[36:56.890 --> 37:01.890]  needs to be some really strict SOPs and stuff if you if you know you have it like
[37:02.690 --> 37:04.690]  You know trying to isolate it
[37:05.810 --> 37:12.490]  Sometimes, you know like the greenhouse growers and stuff that you know kind of are you know, turning things a little bit quicker
[37:13.730 --> 37:20.090]  But you know some of the big outdoor full season guys are really, you know being hurt the most by it
[37:21.090 --> 37:26.170]  Totally. So with tool sterilization now, I've heard bleach works better than alcohol
[37:27.170 --> 37:32.530]  What's your opinion on that? You know, I guess the CLO to or bleach would be ideal, right? Yeah
[37:32.730 --> 37:36.290]  We we use bleach, you know everything that we've kind of seen
[37:36.930 --> 37:43.090]  And in our you know in-house trials and stuff and in reading we use a bleach solution
[37:46.960 --> 37:52.280]  For the listeners out there. We've been using like a between a 15-20%
[37:53.480 --> 37:54.960]  awesome
[37:54.960 --> 38:02.160]  Excellent. So I guess let's start talking about cultivation because you guys are full-on cultivators, you know, you guys talked about your growth
[38:02.560 --> 38:04.560]  How is this season Ben?
[38:04.680 --> 38:08.600]  You know, what are you guys doing with cultivation as far as what varieties are you growing?
[38:10.360 --> 38:12.360]  Yeah, we
[38:12.680 --> 38:14.680]  You know
[38:14.960 --> 38:20.320]  Farming it's or I should say cultivating at scale is is definitely farming now more than ever
[38:21.600 --> 38:23.480]  you know you
[38:23.480 --> 38:29.640]  Last year we we we kind of got slapped in the face and you know, Mother Nature kind of told us who was boss
[38:30.160 --> 38:35.200]  You know in October we got 50 mile an hour sustained winds for
[38:37.560 --> 38:43.760]  For almost a week straight started ripping greenhouses apart and it really did a lot of damage
[38:44.280 --> 38:48.840]  So this year, you know over the winter and spring we did a lot of rebuilding
[38:50.320 --> 38:52.320]  Reinforcing our greenhouses and
[38:53.040 --> 38:58.000]  And so this year's has been has been a good it's been a good year
[38:58.000 --> 39:02.360]  It's like I said, it's it's you know, Mother Nature can be be very humbling
[39:03.640 --> 39:09.620]  So this year has been good. We've been getting some really great results. We've been getting some really great product to market
[39:10.480 --> 39:12.480]  testing, you know real high
[39:12.800 --> 39:14.800]  and just
[39:15.800 --> 39:23.880]  I've been been been really showing off some of some of the new strains, you know, because because TC is such a long process
[39:25.040 --> 39:32.800]  We are you know, we're growing cultivars that will be released in you know, 2022, you know 2021 our whole
[39:34.480 --> 39:40.480]  Our whole line is already already done and set in stone so right now we do a
[39:41.480 --> 39:45.360]  Lot of trials for you know the next season
[39:46.360 --> 39:47.400]  of
[39:47.400 --> 39:49.200]  our release of plants
[39:49.200 --> 39:54.200]  So we like to try to you know, do some stress trials and and you know
[39:54.200 --> 39:58.640]  Just we also have a 10,000 square foot facility in Sacramento
[39:58.640 --> 40:04.520]  So we do a lot of you know trial runs of of strains and then also, you know, pheno hunting
[40:04.920 --> 40:06.920]  but then as well as
[40:07.560 --> 40:09.960]  You know stress testing and stuff like that for
[40:11.560 --> 40:14.040]  For the cultivars that we're putting out through the nursery
[40:14.040 --> 40:18.600]  I think it's very important as a nursery to you know to be able to grow and and
[40:19.480 --> 40:25.100]  Make sure what we're putting out to the market is stable. You know, that's a big thing that you know
[40:26.600 --> 40:30.600]  The market kind of demands, you know, they don't they don't really want you know
[40:31.120 --> 40:38.080]  F3s F4s that they they want everything changing so quick. So, you know, we do our best to try to you know
[40:38.840 --> 40:43.160]  All the cultivars that we're putting out to make sure that they're they're stable
[40:44.880 --> 40:48.280]  Yeah, what just quickly what's this one
[40:49.920 --> 40:54.400]  This is a new one we're working on it's a sunset punch biscotti Sunday
[40:55.400 --> 40:57.480]  cross to to melonade
[40:58.320 --> 41:00.600]  Very this is actually at like four and a half weeks
[41:02.080 --> 41:04.400]  We're able to harvest it in about six
[41:05.360 --> 41:10.600]  So it's one that just got into Colton. We just put it in a culture. We did some I guess that's some trials between
[41:11.440 --> 41:13.520]  indoors and out at the farm
[41:15.080 --> 41:18.680]  So this will be a cultivar that you know be out in like 2022
[41:19.960 --> 41:24.260]  But we've been breeding breeding with a lot right now. We're pretty happy with it
[41:25.260 --> 41:27.260]  It's not sure where
[41:28.020 --> 41:32.820]  purple punch cross back to biscotti and Sunday driver
[41:35.060 --> 41:36.180]  Awesome
[41:36.180 --> 41:42.640]  Yeah, so I get it's so excited about inbred lines, you know, it's like the future of the cannabis industry
[41:42.640 --> 41:49.740]  I believe is in bed lines and you guys get so excited about f1s and that really that's what the market is demanding is those f1
[41:50.180 --> 41:56.780]  Unless you're coming from a seed breeders perspective or somebody who makes auto flower, you know feminized genetics
[41:56.780 --> 42:00.700]  We're there for big AG. You're gonna want something that has less phenotypical variation
[42:01.900 --> 42:07.940]  So yeah, and Jay and I were actually talking the Thursday before he passed we were smoking some sunset sherbert
[42:08.820 --> 42:15.060]  out in front of you guys's grow and we were talking about how auto flower could be cultured and
[42:15.540 --> 42:17.940]  He had this elusive. He thought he had I
[42:18.340 --> 42:25.020]  Was supposed to drop off plants like in two weeks and then he ended up passing and so I'm still looking for that that company
[42:25.020 --> 42:26.260]  they can
[42:26.260 --> 42:29.180]  produce the auto flower tissue culture because that
[42:29.380 --> 42:36.020]  And really what that'll do is that'll change the breeding game for for people like me and people like my friends that read auto flowers
[42:37.140 --> 42:42.260]  Because there'll be no phenotypical variation in the progeny. You'll be able to use one plant. Where's auto flower?
[42:42.260 --> 42:44.740]  Everything has to be bred from seed, right?
[42:45.420 --> 42:51.060]  I'm really looking forward to that. Do you guys see the market slowing down eventually as far as f1s?
[42:52.380 --> 42:56.980]  People getting more excited about you know, or long-term liking things like skittles
[42:57.780 --> 43:04.420]  well, I think you know from a cult a cultivation standpoint, I think it has to you know, I think it has to
[43:04.980 --> 43:10.340]  You know kind of go away from that because you know as things, you know ramp up and scale
[43:10.340 --> 43:15.020]  We we need as a cultivator. We need less, you know
[43:16.820 --> 43:22.900]  Fino phenotypes and also just we need that the the stability, you know, because so many
[43:23.420 --> 43:30.380]  Of the good strains nowadays like when you really start getting some of those at scale you see, you know, you see issues
[43:30.500 --> 43:32.500]  You know stability issues
[43:32.780 --> 43:35.260]  So, you know long term, you know
[43:35.900 --> 43:40.540]  Like I said, I've been breeding and for four years and you know
[43:40.540 --> 43:43.460]  Always trying to back cross and stabilize things, you know
[43:43.460 --> 43:48.240]  But like we said that that's not really what the industry wants right now. They want the changes
[43:48.240 --> 43:53.800]  they want the new the new hot thing and you know, so hopefully as you know,
[43:54.460 --> 44:02.060]  As it normalizes a little bit, you know and slows down a little bit. I hope that you know from a breeding standpoint
[44:02.300 --> 44:04.300]  You know things start to
[44:04.860 --> 44:08.340]  Normalize, you know and follow some of the the other you know
[44:08.740 --> 44:14.220]  Big ag practices where you're actually, you know, really doing breeding and stabilizing things
[44:16.460 --> 44:19.580]  And to touch to touch on that, you know the
[44:21.180 --> 44:22.900]  Bringing some of the
[44:22.900 --> 44:27.340]  Autoflowers, I'd love to to give that a shot. I know you're coming to Sacramento this coming week
[44:27.900 --> 44:34.340]  If you have anything bring it I'd love to you know, that's that's something that you know, like I'm just starting to you know
[44:34.660 --> 44:37.260]  Kind of dive into the the auto flower side
[44:38.540 --> 44:41.940]  You know at the beginning it was such a huge, you know
[44:43.020 --> 44:44.140]  variations
[44:44.140 --> 44:47.820]  Occurring and stuff like that and you know, I kind of shied away from it
[44:47.820 --> 44:50.940]  But I think that the place that it's gonna have in this industry
[44:51.460 --> 44:55.780]  Is is gonna be you know is very long
[44:59.720 --> 45:01.720]  85 acres of
[45:02.160 --> 45:06.200]  Autoflowers next year, you know, like it's it's it's not going away and
[45:07.080 --> 45:12.520]  I would love to you know to try around I'd like I said, I'm just starting to get into the auto flower
[45:12.520 --> 45:15.920]  So, you know, I don't even I know that there's like points
[45:15.920 --> 45:18.680]  I've talked to a couple of other breeders that there's points at which you can
[45:19.240 --> 45:24.280]  Start, you know taking it's a very short windows. What what I understand is like less than a week
[45:25.080 --> 45:28.520]  during that plants, you know maturity level where
[45:29.440 --> 45:33.920]  You know, you can actually take a clone and not have it, you know starting to flower. So
[45:34.720 --> 45:38.720]  There's definitely something I'd be be interested in doing some R&D on
[45:39.440 --> 45:42.320]  Yeah, totally. That sounds awesome. Yeah, Jay was talking about
[45:43.760 --> 45:47.320]  Basically when they're similar to tomatoes and when the
[45:48.320 --> 45:52.640]  The sugar levels do the carbohydrates get to a certain point they go into flower
[45:53.600 --> 45:59.000]  Just like tomatoes and he was saying that you wanted to wait till they were in the flower before you tried to take a culture
[45:59.000 --> 46:00.840]  off
[46:00.840 --> 46:06.440]  So I think that definitely it'd be something great to explore and I think the potentials with it are just huge
[46:06.640 --> 46:11.440]  especially breeding potentials because we're trying to make you know homozygous
[46:12.160 --> 46:17.200]  Plants with seed crops, which is very difficult. Sure. So yeah
[46:18.880 --> 46:20.880]  So, I guess let's talk about
[46:21.720 --> 46:26.160]  You know other states fat. So that's it. You got you know, I think
[46:26.920 --> 46:31.960]  You guys are gonna be remembered for the fat so and I think yeah, that's the highest
[46:32.840 --> 46:38.280]  Highest THC and cannabinoid test that I've seen. What do you think about the testing?
[46:38.800 --> 46:44.040]  You know, I've seen it from multiple places. So it's not just one but the death is off the charts on it
[46:44.520 --> 46:49.240]  yeah, it's funny because you know, I I run the Instagram and
[46:49.240 --> 46:57.560]  You know putting that out there putting that 39% you know test out there, you know, I I was reading some of the comments
[46:57.560 --> 47:01.320]  you know, I kind of just I get aggravated and you know, like
[47:02.120 --> 47:06.400]  multiple people telling me that you know, we invest in testing labs must be a
[47:06.920 --> 47:11.000]  You know part owner of that testing lab and and you know, it's just you know
[47:11.000 --> 47:15.000]  I guess if you're doing, you know, if you're getting that much hate you're you're doing something, right?
[47:15.000 --> 47:18.280]  You know, honestly that that plant, you know, we've
[47:19.760 --> 47:21.760]  We've tried a bunch of different
[47:22.400 --> 47:26.440]  Harvest times that that plant our indoor manager
[47:27.240 --> 47:31.160]  He took that plant and I think it was twelve and a half weeks
[47:31.680 --> 47:36.080]  You know, which you know, it kind of goes against some of what I've known
[47:36.080 --> 47:40.040]  You know as far as THC levels and and degradation of THC
[47:40.040 --> 47:43.720]  In the high THC as a marketing span
[47:46.680 --> 47:48.280]  I
[47:48.280 --> 47:51.880]  don't believe that
[47:52.280 --> 48:06.080]  You know
[48:06.080 --> 48:12.000]  I don't believe in the high THC as a marketing standpoint, you know, like obviously it's
[48:12.000 --> 48:15.680]  a great sales, you know, sales position.
[48:15.680 --> 48:23.680]  But I think the fatso in general, like I'm seeing a lot of friends and other cultivators
[48:23.680 --> 48:28.960]  hitting high 30s with it too, you know, so it's not just us.
[48:28.960 --> 48:34.760]  But what I think is unique about the fatso, you know, especially on that batch, I want
[48:34.760 --> 48:40.840]  to say we hit like seven and a half percent terpenes, you know, and we actually employ
[48:40.840 --> 48:48.080]  a lot of people at the farm that are, you know, just concentrate smokers.
[48:48.080 --> 48:52.640]  You know, they went out and purchased the flower and they're like, man, it's like I
[48:52.640 --> 48:53.840]  was back in high school again.
[48:53.840 --> 48:58.200]  Like I haven't got that high off of a flower in a long time.
[48:58.200 --> 49:03.040]  And I think, you know, that entourage effect that really understanding, you know, it's
[49:03.040 --> 49:10.200]  not just about THC, it's about the terpenes, the cannabinoids and how they're all, you
[49:10.200 --> 49:13.720]  know, all kind of interacting with each other.
[49:13.720 --> 49:19.240]  You know, I've seen because, you know, Kevin from Colorado bred that one.
[49:19.240 --> 49:23.720]  We've had a lot of conversations about that, you know, and he's actually seeing as the
[49:23.720 --> 49:27.400]  markets maturing in Colorado, they're kind of figuring that out.
[49:27.400 --> 49:32.760]  It's not about the THC, you know, it's, you know, I also see that like some of the highest
[49:32.760 --> 49:38.920]  THC and some of the, you know, the product with the most bling doesn't really get you
[49:38.920 --> 49:40.600]  that high, you know.
[49:40.600 --> 49:47.040]  And, you know, Colorado has kind of come full circle where that's not about the THC anymore.
[49:47.040 --> 49:53.720]  It's about, you know, the full effect of all these terpenes and cannabinoids and how they're
[49:53.720 --> 49:59.120]  all, you know, affect and they all affect each person differently as well, you know.
[49:59.120 --> 50:03.320]  And I think the more and more education and the more and more, you know, we're learning
[50:03.320 --> 50:07.480]  about this plant, you know, I think in the long run, we're going to see, you know, the
[50:07.480 --> 50:11.000]  THC, maybe it's not always going to be about the THC.
[50:11.000 --> 50:15.960]  It's going to be about, you know, the uniqueness of these terpenes and how you interact with
[50:15.960 --> 50:16.960]  that.
[50:16.960 --> 50:17.960]  Totally.
[50:17.960 --> 50:20.400]  Effect and taste are just so huge for me.
[50:20.400 --> 50:25.560]  Personally, you know, it's like I have my sour diesel cut to test at 16% and it'll stand
[50:25.560 --> 50:30.040]  up with 99% of those 30% as far as effect.
[50:30.040 --> 50:36.320]  It'll get you just as high, if not more high and definitely attributing it to the terpenes
[50:36.320 --> 50:43.920]  and muricine and all these other things that, and just the combination of terpenes.
[50:43.920 --> 50:50.760]  So that fatso, that fatso is one of the things that, you know, I agree you smoke it, it gets
[50:50.760 --> 50:53.600]  you high as, you know, high as a mother.
[50:53.640 --> 50:56.480]  And man, it just tastes great too.
[50:56.480 --> 50:58.240]  It's one of those enjoyable to smoke.
[50:58.240 --> 51:03.560]  Whereas a lot of the stuff on the market, this 30% plus THC just doesn't taste great.
[51:03.560 --> 51:09.320]  It's missing like that, that loudness, you know, that real bright, bright terpene profile
[51:09.320 --> 51:13.960]  and you know, just big time game changer, you know, big up for that.
[51:13.960 --> 51:16.360]  You know, it's like, he's a great breeder.
[51:16.360 --> 51:21.320]  That guy breeds more strains than anyone I've ever heard of or known.
[51:21.640 --> 51:24.680]  He's constantly coming out with cool, creative shit.
[51:24.680 --> 51:26.840]  Yeah, he's hit a lot of home runs too.
[51:26.840 --> 51:29.320]  We've been lucky to work with him.
[51:29.320 --> 51:31.840]  You know, we've had that relationship for a while now.
[51:31.840 --> 51:39.520]  And you know, especially in these days, you know, like that, you know, some breeders are
[51:39.520 --> 51:43.680]  becoming like, you know, rock and roll stars that he's just very grounded and very happy
[51:43.680 --> 51:45.720]  to be where he is at.
[51:45.720 --> 51:49.920]  So it's nice to work with someone like that.
[51:50.040 --> 51:53.840]  Yeah, he's had some big hitters at Fatso is special.
[51:53.840 --> 52:00.320]  He also has this new one that we're actually just kind of put out to commercial cultivators
[52:00.320 --> 52:05.000]  this year called the Frozen Margie, which I call it the, you know, the connoisseur strain.
[52:05.000 --> 52:11.160]  It's, you know, sour dub crossed with the TK, crossed back onto the chem.
[52:11.160 --> 52:16.400]  And it's funny, I was actually just talking to some of my trimmers this past week and
[52:16.400 --> 52:22.800]  they're just like, the whole terpenes, like it's just, they start trimming that and they
[52:22.800 --> 52:25.640]  almost start falling asleep.
[52:25.640 --> 52:30.280]  It's funny how like that they're not even smoking and just being around that plant for
[52:30.280 --> 52:33.440]  a period of time is actually affecting them.
[52:33.440 --> 52:40.840]  But that was actually one of Jay's, you know, he was very excited for that strain.
[52:40.880 --> 52:48.680]  And me and our indoor cultivation manager Ian are working on doing a cross for him based
[52:48.680 --> 52:54.160]  off of that strain because that was one of the ones that he was most excited about moving forward.
[52:55.160 --> 52:56.160]  Awesome.
[52:56.160 --> 53:00.920]  Yeah, so let's talk about Jay's legacy.
[53:00.920 --> 53:06.040]  What that means to the company, what we can expect to see in the future.
[53:06.040 --> 53:10.400]  You know, we've touched on it a little bit, but you know, if you want to.
[53:10.960 --> 53:18.000]  Yeah, you know, the legacy, you know, it's tough because, you know, when we lost him,
[53:18.000 --> 53:23.240]  you know, as a company, we kind of took a little, you know, a little hiatus trying to
[53:23.240 --> 53:28.480]  figure, you know, figure things out, you know, like for me and him being, you know, he was
[53:28.480 --> 53:31.360]  kind of a younger brother to me.
[53:31.360 --> 53:39.360]  He was definitely very passionate about this industry, very passionate about the plant.
[53:39.520 --> 53:45.000]  And, you know, I touched on earlier, like I think you really start talking to people
[53:45.000 --> 53:48.800]  that might have just had even small interactions with him.
[53:48.800 --> 53:52.400]  And, you know, that meant a lot to them to this day.
[53:52.400 --> 53:55.560]  So, you know, you know, we were good.
[53:55.560 --> 53:56.560]  We were a good team.
[53:56.560 --> 53:58.520]  He was definitely, you know, we're yin and yang.
[53:58.520 --> 54:00.600]  You know, he was, you know, very much.
[54:00.600 --> 54:03.640]  I always called him the lead singer.
[54:03.640 --> 54:09.680]  He was like very, you know, you know, wanted to be out front and did a great job of representing
[54:09.680 --> 54:16.960]  our brand and our company, you know, and that's something that, you know, the company is not
[54:16.960 --> 54:18.640]  going to try to replace.
[54:18.640 --> 54:23.080]  You know, it's more of a switch of marketing focus.
[54:23.080 --> 54:33.680]  But, you know, I think what he what he wanted to really accomplish, he got to see, you know,
[54:33.680 --> 54:35.480]  the very the very beginnings of that.
[54:35.480 --> 54:42.760]  And like I said, it's still like his his his legacy is still, you know, it's slowly moving
[54:42.760 --> 54:48.120]  around the country, you know, in forms of seeds or clones being passed around.
[54:48.120 --> 54:54.000]  And, you know, a lot of people have, you know, great, great, great stories to tell
[54:54.000 --> 54:55.000]  about him.
[54:55.000 --> 55:00.240]  And, you know, starting from, you know, what we went through, you know, together as as
[55:00.240 --> 55:03.200]  partners, you know, coming from the 215 side.
[55:03.200 --> 55:07.640]  And, you know, if you're in this industry long enough, you you know, we went through
[55:07.640 --> 55:13.880]  everything, you know, being being robbed to being, you know, chased by sheriffs.
[55:13.880 --> 55:19.800]  And, you know, obviously, you know, he did some time, you know, and it was always, you
[55:19.800 --> 55:24.920]  know, the focus was always this plant and trying to just, you know, we both kind of
[55:24.920 --> 55:30.520]  felt like we were on a on a path like a, you know, like a higher path that, you know, we
[55:30.520 --> 55:33.880]  just we couldn't really explain why.
[55:33.880 --> 55:41.480]  But, you know, it came back to really just loving the plant and trying to, like I said,
[55:41.480 --> 55:45.240]  trying to break some of this misconceptions.
[55:45.240 --> 55:47.000]  You know, he he would do everything.
[55:47.000 --> 55:52.200]  He would juice the plant to creating salts and lotions and, you know, obviously smoking
[55:52.200 --> 55:53.200]  and stuff.
[55:53.200 --> 55:55.600]  But, you know, he really loved the plant.
[55:55.600 --> 56:02.720]  And, you know, going through all those years together, one of the you know, the cool stories
[56:02.720 --> 56:09.240]  that I can kind of share with with that is, I guess it would be three or four Emerald
[56:09.240 --> 56:10.720]  Cups ago.
[56:10.720 --> 56:18.720]  We we we realized we had something special with with with the TC path we were going down.
[56:18.720 --> 56:23.840]  And unfortunately, we couldn't get a booth at Emerald Cup.
[56:23.840 --> 56:28.120]  So we're actually sharing a booth with some friends, little 10 by 10.
[56:28.120 --> 56:34.320]  Both me and Jared, not small, small dudes, you know, both 6'2", 230, 240.
[56:34.320 --> 56:40.560]  And, you know, we are shoved in one one half of that 10 by 10 with with some plants, you
[56:40.560 --> 56:42.840]  know, kind of telling people, showing them the difference.
[56:42.840 --> 56:44.920]  We you know, we kind of had missed a mark.
[56:44.920 --> 56:48.480]  We're able to like have plants ready for ready for Emerald Cup.
[56:48.480 --> 56:53.800]  So we're kind of showing off the plants and, you know, telling people, you know, what we're
[56:53.800 --> 56:55.640]  going to do.
[56:55.640 --> 57:00.960]  And everyone just kind of laugh and be like, you know, that's that's great and all.
[57:00.960 --> 57:02.520]  But, you know, how can I buy some?
[57:02.520 --> 57:04.240]  And we're like, well, we're just we're not there yet.
[57:04.240 --> 57:07.120]  You know, we just kind of wanted to show show people.
[57:07.120 --> 57:15.880]  And fast forward a year later and we had a good booth with with Kevin Canerado.
[57:15.880 --> 57:20.120]  And I know you came by that year, but.
[57:20.120 --> 57:27.520]  When it opened, like me and him were kind of standing side by side and we just saw this
[57:27.520 --> 57:32.640]  like rush of people and we're like, wow, there's a lot of people coming in.
[57:32.640 --> 57:37.440]  And then it all of a sudden hit us that like, holy shit, they're coming to us.
[57:37.440 --> 57:42.440]  Like we we just got bombarded and we were not ready for it at all.
[57:42.440 --> 57:47.680]  We had like a three hour line waiting to get our plants and our our seeds and our genetics
[57:47.680 --> 57:48.680]  and stuff like that.
[57:48.680 --> 57:54.480]  It was, you know, I'm glad to you know, I definitely like I said, Jay was a brother
[57:54.480 --> 57:56.760]  to me and I miss him dearly every day.
[57:57.640 --> 58:02.640]  You know, getting to really experience that with him was something special.
[58:04.360 --> 58:05.880]  Yeah, that was pretty impressive.
[58:06.560 --> 58:08.360]  They need to keep you in Capulator.
[58:09.360 --> 58:11.920]  We can move to the sides of the room next time.
[58:13.040 --> 58:18.800]  Yeah, I remember we were across from Connected and Connected kept coming over to us and being
[58:18.800 --> 58:19.960]  like, what is going on?
[58:19.960 --> 58:22.040]  Like your your lines impeding our line.
[58:22.280 --> 58:25.600]  There's literally people telling us that they were waiting two and a half, three hours on
[58:25.600 --> 58:28.880]  that line to get, you know, to get to us and and get our products.
[58:29.440 --> 58:33.520]  I saw. And then you guys had to go back to SAC and actually get another truck full of
[58:33.520 --> 58:34.520]  uh.
[58:34.920 --> 58:36.600]  We did. We kept going back to SAC.
[58:36.800 --> 58:40.400]  We just kept running out of more, you know, more clones and more product.
[58:41.520 --> 58:45.280]  Yeah, it's funny because Jay had given me some really tall, lanky looking plants and
[58:45.280 --> 58:47.280]  I'm like, dude, thanks a lot, man.
[58:48.680 --> 58:51.200]  Don't worry, they're going to blow up and it'll be amazing.
[58:51.200 --> 58:53.720]  I'm like, fuck, I guess I'll try them out.
[58:53.720 --> 58:55.840]  And he was right, man. They just they took off.
[58:55.840 --> 58:58.760]  You know, it's like that's the thing with tissue culture plants.
[58:59.120 --> 59:03.720]  It's like especially from tissue culture, it's like they can look funky and they can be
[59:03.720 --> 59:08.160]  long and stretched out. The second they catch, they just grow so vigorously and like the
[59:08.160 --> 59:09.760]  branching is just so unique.
[59:10.320 --> 59:13.000]  Yeah, yeah. I always say like, you know, give it a week.
[59:13.400 --> 59:18.800]  You know, once those like you said, once those roots really catch, you know, they they
[59:18.800 --> 59:20.160]  just they just explode.
[59:20.200 --> 59:22.720]  You know, the plant just explodes that vigor.
[59:23.040 --> 59:28.800]  It's it's unlike anything I've seen before, you know, and, you know, like it goes back
[59:28.800 --> 59:32.960]  to like even with the pots we use, you know, like the pots, like they kind of get the
[59:33.160 --> 59:39.040]  the roots get air pruned, you know, which is, you know, we always get a lot of slack
[59:39.040 --> 59:43.720]  from, you know, our roots might not be blown out the bottom, but the air pruning is
[59:43.800 --> 59:45.160]  it's almost like topping a plant.
[59:45.160 --> 59:50.400]  Like when that root hits the, you know, the outside air, it kind of pulls back in and
[59:50.400 --> 59:52.720]  almost creates another another set of roots.
[59:52.760 --> 01:00:00.780]  So when it really when those plants really come across.
[01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:03.660]  Yeah, it's it's it's impressive.
[01:00:03.740 --> 01:00:05.580]  And then, you know, they branch like a seed.
[01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:10.980]  So, you know, it's like the branching is very uniform and I love the way they look and
[01:00:10.980 --> 01:00:14.980]  they grow. So, yeah, it's it's it's great.
[01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:17.220]  It's coming from the cultivation side.
[01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:24.020]  I'm lucky that, you know, you know, right now we're one of the biggest, you know, the
[01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:28.580]  Yolo Farm is one of the biggest, you know, clients of the nursery.
[01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:32.180]  And it's I can't imagine growing without anything without anything else.
[01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:35.260]  You know, it's just the plants are special.
[01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:42.780]  Yeah, I remember the first time Jay took me to the grow in Sacramento and showed me the
[01:00:42.780 --> 01:00:46.540]  uniformity of the plants and it was just kind of mind blowing.
[01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:52.860]  He was going to, you know, one variety per per section and it's like super uniform.
[01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:58.660]  Yeah, the uniformity, you know, the big the big thing that I see, you know, like we
[01:00:58.660 --> 01:01:03.660]  really don't top them because of that, you know, getting those juvenile traits back, you
[01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:06.860]  know, the branching, you know, I really don't I don't top my plants.
[01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:12.500]  So we see like a 25, 30 percent decrease in our veg time because we're not slowing down
[01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:14.220]  that plant. Right. We're not topping it.
[01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:16.340]  We're not cutting it. We're not doing harm to it.
[01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:23.780]  That plant is just the amount of time that we need in the veg before we put it in the
[01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:29.300]  flower has been decreased, you know, by by leaps and bounds.
[01:01:29.780 --> 01:01:31.500]  Yeah. And you guys have big tall plants, too.
[01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:34.820]  So it's like a week of veg or two and a half weeks of veg.
[01:01:35.140 --> 01:01:36.780]  Yeah, we do. Yeah, we do.
[01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:41.860]  Anywhere, depending on the cultivar, anywhere from like 14 to 21 days.
[01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:43.660]  Wow. Awesome.
[01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:50.260]  So I got a question for you for California rec companies, where can they go to get your
[01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:55.100]  plants? If somebody's interested in getting plants from you guys that has a license in
[01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:56.140]  California, where do they go?
[01:01:56.820 --> 01:02:02.420]  The best is to just email us at sales at Finest Cannabis.
[01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:08.780]  That's the best way to get a hold of some of the some of the sales side of things.
[01:02:09.660 --> 01:02:16.740]  They'll get you, you know, go through an onboarding process and and and be able to give
[01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:26.580]  you some inventory and be able to kind of get you lined up for for sales and orders and
[01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:30.060]  things like that. So, yeah, sales at Finest Cannabis dot com.
[01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:36.180]  Awesome. And then if you're an individual and you're growing your six to however many
[01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:41.140]  plants you're growing in California, where can you go to buy plants?
[01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:44.660]  Is there specific dispensaries that you want to shout out?
[01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:50.980]  Yeah, the sanctuary in Sacramento carries a lot of our plants.
[01:02:52.300 --> 01:03:00.500]  You know, it's tough because we, you know, just as much as I want to get it out to, you
[01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:05.700]  know, like I don't fully agree that, you know, we people should be limited to growing six
[01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:11.340]  plants. You know, I want to see that home grower, you know, be able to experience it.
[01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:18.700]  But sometimes, you know, what we found in the past is working with some dispensaries, you
[01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:21.620]  know, their practices are not great.
[01:03:21.860 --> 01:03:23.820]  And ultimately that hurts us.
[01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:33.020]  So we try to, you know, we try to work with the selected few of dispensaries to really like
[01:03:33.020 --> 01:03:39.980]  we know that they're, you know, they're up to par on their, you know, SOPs and, you know,
[01:03:41.060 --> 01:03:45.900]  you know, not giving out bugs or or, you know, or damaging the plant.
[01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:48.100]  So it's tough.
[01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:53.140]  Like we're definitely, you know, for the next season, we're definitely going through and
[01:03:53.140 --> 01:03:57.060]  kind of vetting more and more dispensaries because we get such a demand.
[01:03:57.060 --> 01:04:01.980]  I mean, I get blown up in the DMs and stuff and, you know, I want to get them out to
[01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:07.620]  people. But at the same time, like I want them to have the same, you know, interaction with
[01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:10.420]  that plant that, you know, the commercial cultivators are getting.
[01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:16.780]  You know, hopefully after, you know, things kind of calm down with COVID and we get to go
[01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:21.300]  back to, you know, some of the events and stuff like that.
[01:04:21.340 --> 01:04:25.340]  That's always like a big, you know, we're always doing the event circuit, you know,
[01:04:26.620 --> 01:04:30.060]  between high times and, you know, emeralds and things like that.
[01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:33.180]  Try to, you know, try to get the plants out to people that way.
[01:04:33.180 --> 01:04:40.300]  So at least we're, you know, the ones that are kind of, you know, controlling how the
[01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:41.420]  plants are being treated.
[01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:48.820]  Nice. Yeah, I miss the community at the cups, you know, it's like regardless of what you
[01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:53.380]  say about high times, what people say about high times, you know, there is that community
[01:04:53.380 --> 01:04:58.700]  at Emerald Cup and high times and all those events that, you know, some of the people
[01:04:58.700 --> 01:05:02.540]  that I really like, I only get to see them at cups because we're all so busy.
[01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:06.580]  And it's, you know, seeing you guys, it was like, you know, all the cups and all the
[01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:08.420]  events. I always get to see you guys and hang out.
[01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:13.540]  Being in Sacramento, I'm not in Sacramento all the time, but, you know, when I stop by,
[01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:17.940]  it's great, too. But it's nice having those events, you know, I feel like everyone's kind
[01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:23.460]  of stepping away from their normal daily life and enjoy the industry and other people
[01:05:23.460 --> 01:05:24.900]  that are passionate about the plants.
[01:05:25.740 --> 01:05:27.740]  Yeah, it's nice. I definitely miss it this year.
[01:05:27.740 --> 01:05:33.980]  You know, I think, you know, Emerald is is kind of, you know, the holy grail for that.
[01:05:33.980 --> 01:05:38.500]  You know, like it's it's more about, you know, the people that have, you know, have been
[01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:40.180]  in the industry for a long time.
[01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:43.700]  You know, it's more about the community and the network.
[01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:47.820]  And, you know, I'm going to miss it for sure this year.
[01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:54.340]  But, yeah, it's it's it's great to, you know, you see, like I said, we've been in the whole
[01:05:54.500 --> 01:06:00.620]  circuit of them for four years, you know, and it's we've forged a lot of friendships and
[01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:02.140]  networks through those events.
[01:06:02.580 --> 01:06:07.460]  And, you know, we keep seeing, you know, even just customers come and getting their six
[01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:12.580]  plants at every single event, which is which is pretty awesome to see, you know, like it's
[01:06:13.020 --> 01:06:13.780]  it's pretty humbling.
[01:06:14.780 --> 01:06:21.140]  Yeah, so speaking of events, I saw you guys at Spanning a couple of years back.
[01:06:21.460 --> 01:06:22.380]  Has that evolved?
[01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:26.500]  And I know you guys, you know, I'm over in Spain as well, working with this whole COVID
[01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:27.820]  thing isn't isn't hitting.
[01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:31.660]  But were you guys did that evolve into anything else working out in Europe?
[01:06:33.300 --> 01:06:38.100]  We were we had a bunch of meetings and stuff for this one that was, you know, that got
[01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:45.020]  canceled, you know, ultimately, I would, you know, you know, as a breeder, female hunter
[01:06:45.020 --> 01:06:50.420]  or whatever, you know, like I, you know, I would love to see our our genetics and the
[01:06:50.420 --> 01:06:52.900]  stuff that we're doing, you know, spread across the world.
[01:06:53.420 --> 01:06:57.380]  You know, we're definitely having those conversations, but, you know, it's definitely
[01:06:57.380 --> 01:07:01.580]  coming to kind of a screeching halt with what kind of just the state that the world is in
[01:07:01.580 --> 01:07:03.540]  right now. Totally.
[01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:06.860]  Well, moving on that, how has COVID affected you guys?
[01:07:07.100 --> 01:07:09.780]  Is an individual for yourself and also as a company?
[01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:16.300]  You know, as an individual, it's been tough, you know, like having, you know, this
[01:07:16.300 --> 01:07:18.780]  machine, you know, moving right now.
[01:07:18.780 --> 01:07:23.980]  Like, I mean, you know, depending on the time of the season, like we'll have, you know,
[01:07:24.620 --> 01:07:27.020]  probably north of 100 employees.
[01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:34.020]  So, you know, it's it's definitely been tough, you know, like I've had to, you know, be
[01:07:34.020 --> 01:07:39.260]  careful, trying not to bring anything home and trying to follow strict guidelines and
[01:07:39.260 --> 01:07:45.660]  things like that. But, you know, it definitely has had an effect on, you know, the farm,
[01:07:45.660 --> 01:07:48.580]  the facility that, you know, I kind of manage.
[01:07:49.220 --> 01:07:53.260]  You know, we've we haven't this year we haven't we've had a real issue with with
[01:07:53.260 --> 01:08:00.620]  trimmers. You know, they're kind of confided into some tighter quarters and more of
[01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:01.860]  them are around each other.
[01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:06.420]  You know, at the farm, you know, we can have 20 employees, but they're spread across,
[01:08:06.420 --> 01:08:08.980]  you know, two acres of cultivation.
[01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:14.100]  But when when the trimmers, you know, they're they're kind of in the tight quarters.
[01:08:14.900 --> 01:08:19.180]  We've had a lot of them, you know, not want to work, you know, quit.
[01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:23.660]  You know, there were were limited on trimming space.
[01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:26.380]  So it's been you know, it's been tough.
[01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:27.540]  You know, I'm not going to lie.
[01:08:27.700 --> 01:08:30.340]  It's been tough to keep consistent workforce.
[01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:38.780]  You know, going. But, you know, just as part of it, just trying to trying to keep going,
[01:08:39.060 --> 01:08:43.100]  pushing forward. You just got to go to old school and send Ben some with the employees.
[01:08:43.100 --> 01:08:46.140]  Then they can. I wish it's actually funny.
[01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:49.820]  It's the first we had some bottleneck and it's the first time I've ever had.
[01:08:50.740 --> 01:08:53.620]  Last week I sold a product on branch.
[01:08:53.700 --> 01:08:59.540]  So it's kind of like, you know, what we've had to go to because, you know, some of that
[01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:03.700]  bottleneck has has happened and we just have a lot of product that's coming down and
[01:09:03.700 --> 01:09:08.220]  stuff. So, you know, it was a first for me is selling some product on branch.
[01:09:08.940 --> 01:09:11.420]  Wow. Yeah. The demand is so high right now.
[01:09:11.460 --> 01:09:16.180]  I mean, the recreational market, just especially if you have quality product, it's like
[01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:17.900]  the market is just ridiculous.
[01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:22.820]  I only see prices going up from here, you know, for the exotic level stuff.
[01:09:22.900 --> 01:09:25.660]  You know, there's that B grade stuff that fluctuate.
[01:09:25.660 --> 01:09:29.340]  But if you have that A grade, I don't see it going down in price.
[01:09:29.700 --> 01:09:35.060]  And I feel like as we get more awareness within the market and people get more smart
[01:09:35.060 --> 01:09:37.460]  about things, they're going to be willing to pay more for their products.
[01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:39.740]  So that end product will even be worth a lot more money.
[01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:43.420]  Yeah, I think, you know, I've been saying it for a while.
[01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:48.900]  I think, you know, the closest analogy we have to this industry is is the wine industry
[01:09:49.260 --> 01:09:55.620]  where you get these huge chasms of, you know, super high grade, you know, to
[01:09:56.140 --> 01:09:57.740]  low economy grade, you know.
[01:09:57.740 --> 01:10:04.140]  So I see, you know, the prices as more and more people are getting into this.
[01:10:04.540 --> 01:10:09.300]  You know, one of the things that I've learned about scale is is that, you know, the
[01:10:09.300 --> 01:10:13.620]  first thing that kind of goes that you really have to get a hold on is quality.
[01:10:13.660 --> 01:10:18.940]  You know, like as you're scaling, like quality seems to take kind of the first hit.
[01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:23.580]  And, you know, if that's not something that you're really concentrating on, you know,
[01:10:23.580 --> 01:10:25.820]  like a lot of people, I feel I can can miss that.
[01:10:26.940 --> 01:10:34.140]  But, you know, if if you have quality product, it's it flies and it just still baffles
[01:10:34.140 --> 01:10:39.580]  me like seems every year, you know, the more and more we grow, the, you know, come
[01:10:39.660 --> 01:10:44.820]  come January, February, the more and more it's dry in California on the rec market.
[01:10:44.820 --> 01:10:51.300]  So it's, you know, it's cool to see because you see a lot of, you know, different
[01:10:51.340 --> 01:10:52.580]  demographics.
[01:10:52.580 --> 01:10:58.300]  You know, I was in the dispensary on Friday and it's just, you know, it's all age
[01:10:58.300 --> 01:11:01.740]  groups and all walks of life kind of coming together.
[01:11:01.740 --> 01:11:07.420]  And, you know, like, you know, I just chuckle that, you know, we went from being
[01:11:07.420 --> 01:11:10.100]  illegal to essential in a matter of a couple of years.
[01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:15.340]  You know, I think the big thing I took away from covid is that, you know, this
[01:11:15.340 --> 01:11:20.180]  industry was just deemed essential, you know, which is which is pretty big.
[01:11:20.180 --> 01:11:24.180]  You know, like sometimes you can get caught up in and the, you know, the
[01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:27.460]  legalization side not moving fast enough at the federal level.
[01:11:27.460 --> 01:11:32.180]  But then you you have things like like this that you can kind of concentrate on and
[01:11:32.180 --> 01:11:37.140]  feel good about because it wasn't long ago, you know, we were we were still getting
[01:11:37.140 --> 01:11:41.020]  chased by, you know, the authorities and stuff, you know.
[01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:45.460]  Totally. Yeah, I'm glad they didn't get rid of medical in California.
[01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:46.820]  That might have changed the whole thing.
[01:11:47.540 --> 01:11:53.380]  For sure. It's been interesting, so I guess we have some time for questions, Peter, do
[01:11:53.380 --> 01:11:55.660]  we have any good questions from the audience?
[01:11:57.300 --> 01:12:03.060]  They're all over the place, so let me try to topically piece them together.
[01:12:05.180 --> 01:12:08.860]  Some people wanted to hear kind of more of a deep dive on tissue culture, but
[01:12:08.860 --> 01:12:11.820]  actually to start with, you had mentioned LEPOT.
[01:12:11.820 --> 01:12:13.860]  Is that E-L-L-E-P-O-T?
[01:12:14.740 --> 01:12:18.100]  Yeah, yeah, it's a type of it's the type of plug.
[01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:23.540]  So it's like a peat perlite, you know, kind of wrapped with a material that biodegrades.
[01:12:24.740 --> 01:12:27.580]  Yeah, let me just I'll show it for everyone in a second.
[01:12:27.580 --> 01:12:33.180]  So can you talk about someone asked organic or synth nudes for Christian.
[01:12:33.180 --> 01:12:40.940]  So what in your YOLO greenhouse set up kind of what's your grow media and set up?
[01:12:41.820 --> 01:12:46.100]  So we actually use raised beds.
[01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:53.900]  It's a soil medium from actually Soil King up in Cloverdale.
[01:12:54.740 --> 01:13:00.580]  It's a great mix. We get a lot of amendments from Vital Garden.
[01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:05.140]  So, you know, I would say it's a mix.
[01:13:05.260 --> 01:13:09.940]  You know, we do use a little bit of synthetics, you know, but we're pretty close to being
[01:13:09.940 --> 01:13:15.260]  organic. We use a lot of nutrients from Cutting Edge.
[01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:20.780]  We we have some high levels of boron and, you know, being in an ag area, you know, you
[01:13:20.780 --> 01:13:27.100]  have to kind of do some custom mixing and things like that to to kind of cater to what
[01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:28.620]  your environment is.
[01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:37.820]  So most of our nutrients are mixed from from Cutting Edge solutions out of Santa Rosa.
[01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:46.100]  We actually use a great product to his Hum Tea loaded with, you know, biologicals and
[01:13:47.020 --> 01:13:48.260]  microbial life.
[01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:51.580]  So, you know, it's a it's a it's a mix.
[01:13:51.580 --> 01:13:57.140]  We do use, you know, some, you know, some some three parts and we use some, you know,
[01:13:57.140 --> 01:13:59.140]  some sugars and stuff like that.
[01:13:59.140 --> 01:14:03.900]  But, you know, we try to be we try to be organic as much as we can.
[01:14:04.060 --> 01:14:07.660]  Yeah, you guys have really found a way to push the turps with everything that you have,
[01:14:07.660 --> 01:14:12.460]  you know, a lot of tastes good when you first hit it, but then as you smoke it down to the
[01:14:12.460 --> 01:14:16.380]  roach, you lose the flavor where you stuff tastes pretty good down to the roach.
[01:14:16.380 --> 01:14:18.940]  I mean, it's not just flushing, it's feeding as well.
[01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:25.180]  Yeah, I got to give a huge shout out to to John at Cutting Edge because, you know, for
[01:14:25.180 --> 01:14:31.420]  years he's been saying that manganese has a direct correlation to to the terpene output
[01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:37.180]  to the terpene output and and to the the trichome production.
[01:14:37.900 --> 01:14:41.900]  And, you know, I've been running his nutrients for.
[01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:50.700]  Oh, man, my nine, 10 years and, you know, I've tried everyone else's and, you know,
[01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:58.140]  he always jokes like, you know, back in the two 15 days, it was, you know, one of the big,
[01:14:58.140 --> 01:15:02.700]  you know, selling points was was what it, you know, what that bag appeal.
[01:15:02.700 --> 01:15:05.660]  So when you open that bag, what did it what did it smell like?
[01:15:05.660 --> 01:15:11.900]  And, you know, always running his stuff, I swear to God, like I would just the bag would
[01:15:11.900 --> 01:15:15.580]  open and it was like the biggest selling point, you know, just stink up the whole room.
[01:15:16.220 --> 01:15:21.820]  And, you know, he always, you know, through and through talked about his they call it
[01:15:21.820 --> 01:15:26.780]  the Uncle John's mix and, you know, high levels of manganese.
[01:15:26.780 --> 01:15:32.940]  And, you know, I was talking with him a couple of weeks ago and it's talking about he was
[01:15:32.940 --> 01:15:39.500]  actually able to prove that at a they did a case study at UC Davis last year on hemp
[01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:46.620]  and terpenes and how that actually correlated with with the raised levels of terpenes.
[01:15:46.940 --> 01:15:48.700]  And he's like, oh, I don't know.
[01:15:48.700 --> 01:15:50.620]  And that's when I found out more about him.
[01:15:50.620 --> 01:15:53.020]  And he was like, Wow, you have so much.
[01:15:54.460 --> 01:15:54.940]  Awesome.
[01:15:56.060 --> 01:15:57.100]  What else we got, Peter?
[01:15:57.100 --> 01:15:58.300]  I know there's some other good ones.
[01:15:58.300 --> 01:16:03.260]  Well, so what you know, the tissue culture question was kind of broad, just more on tissue
[01:16:03.260 --> 01:16:03.980]  culture.
[01:16:03.980 --> 01:16:09.660]  But specifically, if I can add some specificity, you know, you mentioned you had some guys
[01:16:09.660 --> 01:16:13.580]  who had been doing tissue culture for 30 years in traditional ag.
[01:16:13.580 --> 01:16:18.980]  a comment on now working with cannabis? Like, is there anything that's unique or different
[01:16:18.980 --> 01:16:24.040]  or surprising? Or are they like, this is exactly like the strawberries that we've been doing
[01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:25.960]  for 30 years.
[01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:32.160]  Actually it's funny, because when we started working together, you know, I should maybe
[01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:39.320]  take a, take a pause for a second, you know, like, so there's multiple processes of, of
[01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:44.240]  tissue culture. So the first step, the first initial process is actually taking that plant
[01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:51.840]  and putting it into a bleach solution where it cleans, it sterilizes the plant. From there,
[01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:58.040]  it goes into a process where it's kind of for, for a couple of weeks, it's actually
[01:16:58.040 --> 01:17:02.880]  flushing kind of all the endogenous hormones that are built up in that plant. And what
[01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:09.320]  it'll do is it's acclimatizing its, its, its life to, you know, living in a, you know,
[01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:16.660]  a dish where, you know, we're manipulating hormones and stuff. It's, it's not growing
[01:17:16.660 --> 01:17:25.000]  any roots. It's really just, you know, we're pushing the interspacial noting. So the plants
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:31.640]  growing vertically and that's, you know, you kind of take, you take the clones off of,
[01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:36.920]  off those plants and, you know, one plant will turn into, you know, eight plants will
[01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:43.400]  turn into 27 plants and it's kind of an exponential growth. And then you get to the, the rooting,
[01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:48.320]  which is another, a factor, usually have a multiplication rate and you have a rooting
[01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:57.880]  rate to see if that, that plant becomes commercially viable. You know, but going back to that question,
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:04.600]  in that process, you know, our, our partners, they were like, oh, this, you know, it's cannabis,
[01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:10.720]  this is going to be easy. There'll be, you know, maybe two or three agar solutions and,
[01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:19.800]  and it'll be really easy. You know, this plant's not very, very, very unlike other plants.
[01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:29.040]  To this day, we've taken, I'd say probably 120, 130 different varieties through culture
[01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:35.480]  and they have probably about 45 different agar mixes. So it kind of actually was a lot
[01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:43.120]  more complex than they, than they thought originally. It's, you know, the plant, you
[01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:52.800]  know, even, you know, cuts of different cuts of OGs are, are, are not taking the nutrients
[01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:59.360]  in the agar solutions as, as, as evenly as, as they, as they thought they would. So, you
[01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:03.480]  know, going the commercial, you know, route of this, it's definitely, there was definitely
[01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:07.120]  a big learning curve, you know, for the group.
[01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:12.320]  So question for you, I think for home, home people, you know, when I first heard about
[01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:16.840]  tissue culture, I said, fuck, I want to do this. This is something huge and it's going
[01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:20.480]  to make a huge difference with a lot of things and I need to learn how to do it. And then
[01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:25.080]  the more and more I got involved in learning about it, I realized that I'd much rather
[01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:31.280]  people like you guys do it and me specialize in breeding. So if people want to get started,
[01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:38.360]  you recommend them getting kits at home or what's your recommendations for the, the home,
[01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:40.560]  home users that want to start with tissue culture?
[01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:50.080]  Yeah, definitely. You know, it's, I believe it's a, it's a big mix of, of, of science
[01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:58.680]  and art. You know, the science side of it, you know, like there's, you know, I've seen
[01:19:58.680 --> 01:20:05.440]  middle school groups, you know, tissue culturing Redwoods and, and, you know, Santa Cruz before,
[01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:10.360]  you know, the process is, is not, there's different levels. We kind of talked about
[01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:14.640]  different levels of like, you know, kind of quick, quick rinses where you can kind of
[01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:22.840]  get a plant in the culture and, and kind of, you know, regenerate some of the vigor. So
[01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:27.680]  at that level, yeah, I mean, I believe that, you know, really anybody could, you know,
[01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:35.080]  buy a kit like Bill Graham made an amazing kit back in the day. And you can, you know,
[01:20:35.720 --> 01:20:40.800]  you can put that plant into, into culture and get some of that vigor and stuff back.
[01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:46.280]  But, you know, as far as like commercial production, you know, and a lot of people that tried it
[01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:52.640]  will tell you, you know, there's definitely a art that comes along with years and years
[01:20:52.640 --> 01:21:00.240]  of experience that, you know, a lot of people aren't going to be able to accomplish, you
[01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:07.440]  know. So I, you know, always, always, always keep learning and always trying new things,
[01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:13.760]  you know, and I think people can definitely, you know, clean up their plants at home, you
[01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:19.280]  know, using one of those, one of those methods, keeping them a little more sterile.
[01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:29.220]  Okay, so switching topics. This is from a while ago when we were talking about all the
[01:21:29.220 --> 01:21:38.900]  viruses and viroids. Suavito Dadan, who's down in St. Martin in the Caribbean, said,
[01:21:38.900 --> 01:21:45.940]  I run Sour Diesel here in St. Martin, and I learned about wood ash and grass to flush slash kill
[01:21:45.940 --> 01:21:51.860]  virus and diseases and plants. Has anybody done research with wood ash charcoal for viruses?
[01:21:52.740 --> 01:21:57.060]  Basically, he's been using it for any sick plants for years, something he learned from
[01:21:57.060 --> 01:21:58.740]  fellow growers here on the island.
[01:22:02.340 --> 01:22:08.980]  That's something new to me. I haven't come across anything like that yet. But it's
[01:22:08.980 --> 01:22:13.780]  definitely interesting. I'd like to, you know, definitely do some research on that.
[01:22:16.420 --> 01:22:21.300]  Yeah, it's funny. I just got a message from one of, you know, two days ago, I got a message
[01:22:21.300 --> 01:22:25.860]  from one of the viewers that watched the show that said he had an all natural cure for viruses
[01:22:25.860 --> 01:22:31.860]  and viroids. And so I was waiting for him to like, expand on it. But I'm sure he will. And
[01:22:31.860 --> 01:22:36.580]  I'm assuming he watches the show every week. But yeah, it's interesting that things people
[01:22:36.580 --> 01:22:40.980]  do you know which chat Do you know what his YouTube name is? I can look it up.
[01:22:41.620 --> 01:22:45.140]  Did he tell you what his YouTube name? Yeah, I can. And if you're watching,
[01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:51.060]  let us know so we don't have to search for you in real time as everyone watches. Should we should we
[01:22:51.620 --> 01:22:54.820]  post up on you while you're going through your email?
[01:22:55.380 --> 01:22:58.980]  His name is Mattias Hunt. And so he said,
[01:23:01.220 --> 01:23:02.980]  he's got the Mattias here.
[01:23:10.140 --> 01:23:18.300]  So let me try to see if I can translate this question. The Grow Green show basically was
[01:23:18.300 --> 01:23:25.100]  talking about percent terpenes. You know, if kind of, if kind of one criteria for a keeper's
[01:23:25.100 --> 01:23:31.740]  percentage of terpenes for a pheno, if so, what is the common terpene percentage in a keeper?
[01:23:35.740 --> 01:23:40.860]  I don't, you know, again, I don't want to concentrate on levels of, you know, I'd say
[01:23:40.860 --> 01:23:47.100]  overall percentages, it's more, you know, I definitely have have some great stuff that have,
[01:23:47.740 --> 01:23:54.140]  you know, amazing terpenes, you know, in the bag that I'm seeing, like, you know, one and a half to
[01:23:54.140 --> 01:23:59.980]  2%. And then we have stuff that are, you know, hitting seven and a half, 8%, you know, but I
[01:23:59.980 --> 01:24:08.140]  think it's really understanding, you know, like, what that terpenes effect is on, on, on you as an
[01:24:08.140 --> 01:24:14.060]  individual or, you know, because everyone interacts with with the terpenes differently, you know,
[01:24:14.140 --> 01:24:18.940]  mercine, and, you know, all these terpenes have, you know, different effects on people.
[01:24:20.540 --> 01:24:26.780]  So I, you know, I, again, I don't like looking really at numbers and saying, you know, you know,
[01:24:26.780 --> 01:24:33.740]  this is only commercially viable if it hits 3% on the terpene level, because I really look more at
[01:24:33.740 --> 01:24:37.980]  what what terpenes those are, rather than, you know, an overall percentage.
[01:24:38.860 --> 01:24:49.220]  Al Heyman, I know you grow in soil, but he just kind of wanted to know, both of you kind of
[01:24:49.220 --> 01:24:52.900]  thoughts on cocoa as a grow media.
[01:24:52.900 --> 01:24:56.340]  You know, I'll start off with that. But yeah, I really like cocoa as a sterile,
[01:24:57.540 --> 01:25:04.500]  you know, something that's in between using soil and using rockwool. I'm not a huge rockwool fan,
[01:25:04.500 --> 01:25:09.620]  personally, although I have a lot of friends that get great success. Cocoa is kind of that
[01:25:09.780 --> 01:25:16.980]  cocoa is kind of that happy medium, and especially for doing large indoor cultivations for seed
[01:25:16.980 --> 01:25:23.540]  production. I feel like it's a great solution. It's easy to use, and it's not as bad for the
[01:25:23.540 --> 01:25:29.140]  well, it's not bad for the environment like rockwool. What's your take on that, Christian?
[01:25:29.140 --> 01:25:35.220]  Christian I definitely agree. You know, our indoor facility, we kind of run a hybrid of
[01:25:35.220 --> 01:25:43.860]  cocoa and rockwool. You know, rockwool is not my favorite, you know, but commercially, you know,
[01:25:47.140 --> 01:25:51.540]  scale building commercially, it's a lot easier to use. But, you know, we've been actually
[01:25:52.020 --> 01:25:59.140]  kind of, you know, going back to running more and more trials on cocoa. You know, the big,
[01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:04.740]  you know, the big trend in the industry with indoor right now is, you know, is the crop
[01:26:04.740 --> 01:26:12.820]  steering is the, you know, the drybacks and things like that. And, you know, Ian has been doing a
[01:26:12.820 --> 01:26:19.860]  great job on, you know, really getting a handle on the crop steering. And, you know, you get better
[01:26:19.860 --> 01:26:26.980]  drybacks, quicker drybacks, I should say on, you know, on rockwool. But, you know, personally, I
[01:26:27.940 --> 01:26:35.860]  rather do a lot more cocoa. Like you said, it's inert, so you can get good drybacks and
[01:26:37.140 --> 01:26:43.860]  for the crop steering, but you can also, you know, still build up some sort of microbial life as well.
[01:26:45.300 --> 01:26:48.740]  Cation exchange, whereas with rockwool, there's no cation exchange.
[01:26:48.740 --> 01:26:49.240]  Exactly.
[01:26:50.660 --> 01:26:54.500]  Can you guys elaborate a little bit on crop steering? Kind of what it is and
[01:26:54.820 --> 01:26:57.300]  why there's a trend of more and more people doing it?
[01:26:58.820 --> 01:27:04.660]  You know, it's more and more data. When you can actually dry down that plant,
[01:27:04.660 --> 01:27:11.700]  you know, and kind of push nutrients to that plant at certain mediums, you know,
[01:27:11.700 --> 01:27:18.900]  the plant will actually uptake and use those nutrients more. You'll see better yields,
[01:27:19.620 --> 01:27:28.100]  you'll see a tighter bud structure, you know, some say that you can see higher THC levels and
[01:27:28.100 --> 01:27:35.940]  stuff like that. I personally have never really seen that, but it's more on yields is kind of
[01:27:35.940 --> 01:27:41.140]  how I see it. You know, being able to let that plant almost drought stressing that plant and
[01:27:41.140 --> 01:27:46.660]  then shooting it through with a bunch of nutrients, it's going to absorb those nutrients and use those.
[01:27:47.380 --> 01:27:50.660]  It's going to be more bioavailable, you know, to that plant.
[01:27:50.660 --> 01:27:53.780]  So you're going to get kind of more bang for your buck.
[01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:01.800]  James, anything to add there now?
[01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:02.760]  Well, that sounded great.
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:15.800]  Gerardo Bravo asked, can you ask them what their fantasy hybrid strain would be for both of you?
[01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:20.680]  If you could cross anything with anything.
[01:28:21.080 --> 01:28:25.000]  Anything with anything, it would be cat piss times everything.
[01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:31.720]  I miss cat piss. So it's one of those things that's really unique. And I've had a lot of,
[01:28:32.280 --> 01:28:37.320]  you know, counterfeit cat piss varieties. A lot of people say they have it or they've crossed it,
[01:28:37.320 --> 01:28:43.000]  or they've done these things. The closest I think anybody's come is probably Bodie has some stuff,
[01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:49.960]  which I would love to get him on the show to talk about. But that terpene profile that's got the
[01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:57.800]  skunk with the kind of a burn your nose ammonia. Me personally, I love that it's very far from the
[01:28:57.800 --> 01:29:02.760]  exotic market that we have today. But it's something that is nostalgic for me. It's,
[01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:07.800]  you know, in the early 90s, that was what we smoked. And we paid $60 an eighth straight up
[01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:11.480]  for pounds if you wanted to buy a pound of it, it was $60 an eighth, didn't matter how much you
[01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:17.400]  bought. But a 10th of a gram would just stink your whole car or house or whatever you're in,
[01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:23.720]  people would know you had that cat piss. And, you know, I really I go back to kind of my roots with
[01:29:23.720 --> 01:29:29.320]  the varieties. I do love reading some of these exotics. I love sour diesel and chems and gas.
[01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:34.120]  But yeah, cat piss would be like, would be the winner for me.
[01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:41.880]  And if Steve Webb's watching, I do have your cat piss that I'm gonna pop soon.
[01:29:42.360 --> 01:29:47.000]  Yeah, I don't believe it. So you know, that's, that's what we'll find out. You know, it's like
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:51.960]  I've even offered up $1,000 if someone can show me the real cat piss. So I'll just put that out
[01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:57.800]  there. You know, if you have the real cat piss, it smokes down to the roach and you can light it up
[01:29:57.800 --> 01:30:02.040]  the next day and it still tastes like cat piss. That was one of the, that was the first thing
[01:30:02.040 --> 01:30:06.040]  that I smoked that you could fire it up two days later, three days later, a week later,
[01:30:06.040 --> 01:30:10.920]  and it would still taste like cat piss. The terpenes were so intense with it that it
[01:30:11.800 --> 01:30:15.640]  tasted good all the way through to the very bottom of the roach.
[01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:22.120]  So Christian, what do you have to talk, strain wise, genetic wise?
[01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:30.520]  I love gas. I love the funky gas, you know, the GMOs, the chems, you know, I grew some chems for
[01:30:30.520 --> 01:30:36.920]  a long time and I just, you know, that gas is, you know, I haven't come really across a good
[01:30:36.920 --> 01:30:41.720]  cat piss, but you know, when you have a good gas, that's just like offensive, you know, that's,
[01:30:41.720 --> 01:30:46.440]  that's what I really like. And that's, you know, always for me, like, that's where I've always
[01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:51.960]  gravitated towards, you know, my personal head stash and, you know, if I'm going to, you know,
[01:30:51.960 --> 01:30:58.920]  do some breeding. I mean, I do love some of the new, like exotic, crazy flute, sorry, fruit flavors
[01:30:58.920 --> 01:31:03.560]  and stuff like that. But, you know, for me personally, I just love that, that really,
[01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:11.160]  really offensive gas. I've heard some people, you know, call it like, you know, like burning tires
[01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:16.600]  and just, you know, just when you have a good chem or, you know, I love the GMO too. It's just,
[01:31:17.480 --> 01:31:22.520]  it's just offensive when you smell it, you know? Yeah. I love gas too. You can't go wrong with a
[01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:28.120]  good headband. I mean like a real, yeah, it's almost foul gas, but I love that, that burning
[01:31:28.120 --> 01:31:33.400]  tire. And most people, you can't really explain it unless you smelled it and smelled the burning
[01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:38.360]  tire, but it's, it's there. It's a burning rubber, burning tire. It smells exactly like that
[01:31:38.360 --> 01:31:45.000]  with that jet fuel behind it. And yeah, I mean, that's still, I smoke a lot of that. I've been
[01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:50.120]  smoking a lot of Pluto lately. You know, before October, I'm taking a break for the month of
[01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:57.480]  October. Two days ago, I had to smoke some Snow Montana. It took two hits off a joint. So that's,
[01:31:57.480 --> 01:32:02.600]  that's it for October. But yeah, gas, there's something special about gas and the people
[01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:07.480]  that like gas, you know, it's like, we're like a big, huge family. Yeah.
[01:32:10.200 --> 01:32:13.960]  Yeah. What else we got, Peter? I know there's some other good ones.
[01:32:15.480 --> 01:32:23.080]  Uh, Strong Style Organics, uh, asked what medium would be best for a small indoor stealth grow?
[01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:27.000]  And he said, uh, Rockwell would have the smallest total volume question mark.
[01:32:29.720 --> 01:32:34.200]  I assume that's maybe for selling on the traditional market, but saying discreet.
[01:32:35.240 --> 01:32:42.040]  So let's say that person who's listening. Yeah. I mean, the thing is, is like, I feel like you can
[01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:48.520]  use one gallon pots of cocoa or one gallon pots of soil. If you're going for turps and you know,
[01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:52.440]  you're, you're doing a small growth, there's nothing wrong with using soil. You know, you can
[01:32:52.440 --> 01:32:58.120]  get some amazing soil products. You're talking, you know, vital cell soil. Uh, you guys use Soil
[01:32:58.120 --> 01:33:03.640]  King. I mean, if you're growing for smoking, uh, you know, and you can get just as good a yield.
[01:33:03.640 --> 01:33:09.080]  Some people say you get better. It's all about canopy size and, and crop steering, like we were
[01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:14.920]  talking about earlier, but I don't, you know, it's whatever you feel comfortable with. I feel the best
[01:33:14.920 --> 01:33:21.800]  turps come from soil. I make seeds mostly. So I prefer cocoa, uh, Rockwell, you know, if you want
[01:33:21.800 --> 01:33:27.560]  the LA look that, that looks amazing, that's got the Rockwell will give you the look. Soil will
[01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:34.200]  give you the taste. I couldn't agree more. I, you know, I, I just, I just think the way that the,
[01:33:34.200 --> 01:33:43.160]  the, you know, the terpenes and the cannabinoids interact with, with the, the mycology and, um,
[01:33:44.040 --> 01:33:47.800]  in soil, it just, you can't reproduce that with, with Rockwell.
[01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:55.880]  And just to be clear, strong style is not growing to sell on the traditional market. I was adding
[01:33:55.880 --> 01:34:02.280]  to the question saying, if you were someone who wanted to stay small, tight and productive.
[01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:05.560]  Sure. We know his parents don't want to know about his growth.
[01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:10.440]  Strong style is legally compliant with six or fewer plants.
[01:34:11.720 --> 01:34:12.200]  Excellent.
[01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:20.760]  Excellent. Um, all right, let me go. I have this all at like tiny fun. Uh,
[01:34:24.580 --> 01:34:29.140]  yeah. Key salmon, jammy kiosk. Anyone know where to get some pre 98 Bubba?
[01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:36.500]  Yeah. Pre 90 is all over the place. Uh, in California, as far as dispensaries, I'm not sure,
[01:34:37.300 --> 01:34:42.980]  but, uh, I see it popping up in joints fairly regularly. I think it's, it's bred into a lot
[01:34:43.140 --> 01:34:51.220]  of stuff as well. Um, yeah. Yeah. What are you going to say about that, Christian? I'm not a
[01:34:51.220 --> 01:34:57.380]  huge fan of it anymore, but you know, there's a long time. Master cushion Bubba. I used to love
[01:34:57.380 --> 01:35:03.060]  smoking those strings. I used to love master. Um, I still bump into it quite a bit, you know,
[01:35:03.060 --> 01:35:07.940]  still visiting a lot of farms and stuff in the Emerald triangle. I still see it
[01:35:07.940 --> 01:35:12.340]  all the time up there. Um, I haven't really seen it in, in, um,
[01:35:14.020 --> 01:35:20.100]  in dispensaries in a long time, but you know, like that's, it's definitely, you know, still in
[01:35:20.100 --> 01:35:24.340]  the rec market quite a bit. I, like I said, I still see it a lot of it a lot up in the Emerald
[01:35:24.340 --> 01:35:29.860]  triangle. Yeah, I think. And then there's a lot of Asian growers out there that were doing it
[01:35:29.860 --> 01:35:36.340]  because of the short flowering time. Yeah. A lot of Asian girls and they were using Bubba and a
[01:35:36.340 --> 01:35:41.300]  lot of them have switched over to gelato. You know, I think a lot of it was the new Bubba in
[01:35:41.300 --> 01:35:46.740]  some cases. Uh, I was saying purple punch was the, you know, purple punches, the new blue dream.
[01:35:47.460 --> 01:35:59.540]  And, uh, you know, gelato is the new Bubba. Uh, Al Heyman, uh, still on the cocoa train. Uh,
[01:35:59.540 --> 01:36:06.020]  can I still get a good terpene profiles with a mix of 50% cocoa and 50% soil, or do I have to
[01:36:06.020 --> 01:36:12.500]  go straight soil for high terpenes? No, I think there's value in blending. You know, it's like,
[01:36:12.500 --> 01:36:17.460]  uh, you can blend your cocoa and your soil together. You can actually get great tasting
[01:36:17.460 --> 01:36:22.660]  cannabis from cocoa. I just feel like it's a little bit better using soil. Um, you know,
[01:36:22.660 --> 01:36:29.060]  Charcourt sells a amazing cocoa. They're out of Washington. Uh, I know Michael from Charcourt.
[01:36:29.060 --> 01:36:35.620]  He's a great dude. And then, uh, my other buddy does a blend of Charcourt with paralyte from
[01:36:36.500 --> 01:36:42.100]  BNS garden supply in San Leandro. And that's a good product. It's an even lighter product. So
[01:36:42.100 --> 01:36:46.660]  if you're concerned with that dry back, you get a really good dry back with it. And it's extremely
[01:36:46.660 --> 01:36:52.100]  light, but as far as blending soil and cocoa, I think that's a great way to lighten up your soil.
[01:36:52.100 --> 01:36:56.420]  It's just depending on what you're doing. Um, if you're using living soil, you don't necessarily
[01:36:56.420 --> 01:37:04.820]  need it though. Yeah, I agree. I, um, I think most of the good blends now all have, you know,
[01:37:04.820 --> 01:37:10.260]  some, some percentage of, of cocoa in there for, you know, for making it lighter and getting some
[01:37:10.260 --> 01:37:16.500]  of those dry backs and stuff. Yeah. And the grow green show said cocoa and microbes go well together.
[01:37:16.980 --> 01:37:29.060]  I do. Um, big bud, seven, seven, seven said BC, but I missed that time warp and wheelchair
[01:37:29.060 --> 01:37:34.580]  mighty. My hospital weed is gone. You said, you always said is forbidden fruit still a thing.
[01:37:37.700 --> 01:37:42.660]  Yeah, there's nothing wrong with forbidden fruit. I mean, it's, it's unique in its own, right?
[01:37:42.740 --> 01:37:50.340]  I have no problem with forbidden fruit. Um, it's not my choice of smoke. Uh, there's a purple
[01:37:50.340 --> 01:37:55.380]  Tangy and forbidden fruit are very similar. I really liked the purple Tangy. Uh, you know,
[01:37:55.380 --> 01:37:59.620]  if I was to pick the two forbidden fruit is, I know it's super popular with my friends in
[01:37:59.620 --> 01:38:04.500]  Washington up at a Canada organics, they they're crushing forbidden fruit and it's,
[01:38:04.500 --> 01:38:09.220]  it's huge on the rec market up in Seattle. They can't, they can't grow enough of it.
[01:38:09.940 --> 01:38:16.340]  So top floor genetics asked, uh, advice for keeping males long-term for small growers.
[01:38:18.500 --> 01:38:26.100]  Uh, don't, you know what? Collect the pollen. Yeah. Collect the pollen. Exactly. Collect the
[01:38:26.100 --> 01:38:31.780]  pollen, put it in your freezer. Uh, I've had trouble storing males long-term. I've lost so
[01:38:31.780 --> 01:38:36.580]  many good males. Uh, when you get a good one, make the pollen, put it on other things,
[01:38:37.380 --> 01:38:43.140]  do some selections and, and keep those plants alive. Uh, you know, or, you know, making
[01:38:43.140 --> 01:38:48.020]  feminized seeds is a great solution. Uh, but keeping those males a lot of tissue culture,
[01:38:48.020 --> 01:38:51.620]  you know, I guess that, that could be a good long-term storage solution.
[01:38:51.620 --> 01:38:58.500]  It would cost a lot of money to have somebody bank your genetics like that. So, yeah, we've,
[01:38:58.500 --> 01:39:05.460]  we've done some R and D, um, with, uh, with male plants and culture. And, um, we've actually still
[01:39:05.460 --> 01:39:13.060]  seen them, you know, want to, want to flower, you know, and even in culture. Um, so over a period
[01:39:13.060 --> 01:39:17.380]  of time, like we've still seen them starting to, you know, throw pollen sacks and stuff like that.
[01:39:17.380 --> 01:39:21.700]  So I still think the best way is just, you know, collect that pollen.
[01:39:24.180 --> 01:39:29.220]  Yeah. Male plants are amazing. Yeah. Well, yeah, collect that pollen, use the pollen,
[01:39:29.220 --> 01:39:34.740]  put it on a lot of things. Uh, I think, I think a lot of people believe that, you know,
[01:39:35.540 --> 01:39:41.220]  like seed companies, it's all about making seeds. Really the thing is, you know, hunting. And I
[01:39:41.220 --> 01:39:45.140]  think it gets lost with a lot of people. They're like, well, I can start a seed company and I'm
[01:39:45.140 --> 01:39:50.180]  going to be this breeder and I'm going to make amazing seeds. But they, they lose where they
[01:39:50.180 --> 01:39:57.060]  lose it is the pheno hunting side. And that's what makes a good seed company great or a bad seed
[01:39:57.060 --> 01:40:01.620]  company shitty. Cause anybody can make seeds. You can take a male plant and take a female plant
[01:40:01.620 --> 01:40:07.700]  together, put that pollen on the female plant and make seeds. What makes a great seed company or
[01:40:07.700 --> 01:40:13.620]  great breeder is the guy who can do the pheno hunt. Who can go sit around, spend a lot of time with
[01:40:13.620 --> 01:40:20.980]  his plants, smell those cultivars, uh, or, or everything in the progeny and pick the winners.
[01:40:20.980 --> 01:40:26.100]  You're looking for those unicorns and you don't just make, I mean, there's, there's people to do
[01:40:26.100 --> 01:40:30.420]  it, but, but my thought is it's all about that pheno hunt. And, you know, I believe you're the
[01:40:30.420 --> 01:40:35.780]  same way, Christian. It's like, you know, you got to put a lot of time into it and you got to smell
[01:40:35.780 --> 01:40:39.700]  for certain things. And then on top of that, you got to grow it a second time, because if you're
[01:40:39.700 --> 01:40:44.580]  doing it from seed that second time, if you're doing it from clone, you're going to get a different
[01:40:44.580 --> 01:40:48.500]  expression than growing from seeds. And that's kind of the beauty of tissue culture. It kind
[01:40:48.500 --> 01:40:54.180]  of brings it back to that original expression. A lot of times. Absolutely. I couldn't, I couldn't
[01:40:54.180 --> 01:41:00.100]  agree more, you know, like, uh, early on, it was funny. I'd always be getting in arguments with my
[01:41:00.100 --> 01:41:04.420]  wife because I was always spending so much money on buying seeds. It's almost, you know, becomes
[01:41:04.420 --> 01:41:09.620]  like an addiction because, you know, like that's what I love about it is, is the pheno hunt. It's
[01:41:09.620 --> 01:41:13.220]  like, you never know what you're going to find. You know, there, there's been times I've popped
[01:41:13.220 --> 01:41:17.300]  a hundred seeds and I might've found one that I really wanted to keep. And then there's times I
[01:41:17.300 --> 01:41:24.020]  popped 10 seeds and found six of them, you know, so the, the, the pheno hunting side of it is,
[01:41:24.020 --> 01:41:29.460]  has always been, has always been big for me. Never knowing what you're going to find. And then,
[01:41:29.460 --> 01:41:33.940]  you know, also on the breeding side, when you, when you're trying to express certain things and,
[01:41:34.500 --> 01:41:40.980]  you know, as much as you might want to express one, you know, portion of that plant. And then
[01:41:40.980 --> 01:41:45.060]  when you actually get to that, you know, is, is a great feeling as well.
[01:41:45.460 --> 01:41:48.420]  Yeah. I mean, for the longest time there was no OG seeds.
[01:41:49.060 --> 01:41:49.540]  Yeah.
[01:41:49.540 --> 01:41:54.820]  For the longest time. And OG is another one of my favorites, along with the, the chem and all
[01:41:54.820 --> 01:42:03.060]  these other things. But OG is very hard. It's a, it's that gas is not easy to capture. And if you
[01:42:03.060 --> 01:42:06.820]  look at all the seeds out there, there's only a handful of people who have made really good OG
[01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:12.020]  seeds. You know, there's lots of good OG phenos and stuff like that. But as far as something that
[01:42:12.900 --> 01:42:17.060]  you're going to get a lot of gas in the entire progeny, that's going to have great structure.
[01:42:17.060 --> 01:42:19.860]  OG doesn't have a great structure anyway, for the most part. There's a couple.
[01:42:21.700 --> 01:42:23.540]  But yeah.
[01:42:23.540 --> 01:42:27.860]  You mentioned that Pluto, I just, I just got a cut of that a little while ago. It's in culture.
[01:42:28.580 --> 01:42:33.700]  And that's, you know, definitely a cush that, I mean, that's.
[01:42:34.260 --> 01:42:35.780]  So are you working with sticky farms?
[01:42:36.500 --> 01:42:37.140]  What's that?
[01:42:37.140 --> 01:42:41.700]  Are you working with sticky farms? Well, my thing with the Pluto is, is like, and I've talked to
[01:42:42.260 --> 01:42:44.660]  guys from sticky and gas houses, like they haven't given it out.
[01:42:45.300 --> 01:42:45.780]  Right.
[01:42:45.780 --> 01:42:50.900]  There's cuts out, but I've never seen them. I've never seen anybody actually grow them.
[01:42:50.900 --> 01:42:54.500]  I've had friends that say they had it and then grew it up and didn't have it. I've been working
[01:42:54.500 --> 01:42:59.940]  with sticky farms on some breeding projects, along with some other, other groups as well.
[01:43:02.500 --> 01:43:05.780]  We're not working with them per se, like, you know, it's one of those,
[01:43:05.780 --> 01:43:12.340]  you know, Mendocino connections that, you know, say they have it. So I've ran it a couple of
[01:43:12.340 --> 01:43:17.780]  times, but I, you know, it's still one of those that I feel like hasn't really got out to the
[01:43:17.780 --> 01:43:22.900]  public very much. So, you know, we'll see. I don't, I don't even know if it's the real one yet.
[01:43:22.900 --> 01:43:28.260]  You know, I want to get, get it out to some, some more people, but it was a great, great cush.
[01:43:29.380 --> 01:43:32.580]  Yeah, man, the smoke on that. I just like it because it hits on all the points.
[01:43:32.900 --> 01:43:37.860]  Yeah. You smoke it. It tastes, it has that floral character, you know, the little bit of the gelato.
[01:43:37.860 --> 01:43:43.300]  It has the wedding cake, the bag of peel, but like the smoke, it's like you smoke that road
[01:43:43.300 --> 01:43:49.540]  to the next day or the day after it still tastes like Pluto. Yeah. I love that. It's not like all
[01:43:49.540 --> 01:43:54.180]  the other gelato crosses because there's, you know, besides the rename game where there's,
[01:43:54.180 --> 01:43:58.900]  you know, a hundred different gelatos, which goes on quite a bit. It's just people renaming
[01:43:58.900 --> 01:44:07.700]  other people's stuff. I feel like it has its own unique turf profile. All right. So we have
[01:44:11.990 --> 01:44:15.750]  strong style organics, just cause we were talking about males before
[01:44:15.750 --> 01:44:19.910]  minimum lighting to hold a male. How small can you go and get decent pollen?
[01:44:23.540 --> 01:44:28.820]  It depends on what you're talking about for decent pollen. You can, you know, you can take a
[01:44:28.820 --> 01:44:32.740]  plant and put it in a flower and you're going to get a little bit of pollen. I mean,
[01:44:32.740 --> 01:44:38.580]  male plants, as opposed to reverse plants, put out a good amount of pollen. And if you take it
[01:44:38.580 --> 01:44:44.100]  from seed and you're doing your selections from seed, they're going to veg up to a certain size,
[01:44:44.100 --> 01:44:50.980]  regardless of the light cycle, and then flip over. So you'll get a decent amount of pollen.
[01:44:50.980 --> 01:44:55.060]  If you're just trying to make a little bit of seed, you can go straight into 12-12 or,
[01:44:56.740 --> 01:45:01.300]  you know, but if you're looking at, you know, you want to basically pollinate a room and you're
[01:45:01.300 --> 01:45:05.780]  talking about pollinating like nine plants, you're going to want to veg that up. I think
[01:45:06.820 --> 01:45:11.060]  one plant, I mean, I've had experiences where I had one plant in a room and I made
[01:45:11.700 --> 01:45:16.820]  like about 400,000 seeds, which sounds ridiculous, but we didn't catch it in time.
[01:45:16.820 --> 01:45:20.900]  And it pollinated the whole room. My usual ratio is like one to nine.
[01:45:23.300 --> 01:45:29.940]  So, you know, anywhere from one to nine to one to 15 with regulars and fems is, you know, anywhere
[01:45:29.940 --> 01:45:38.580]  from one male to one reversed female to six to nine, just depending. So that goes with autos as
[01:45:38.580 --> 01:45:44.500]  well. You guys do some breeding, Christian, so what do you recommend as far as...
[01:45:46.340 --> 01:45:53.380]  The density is definitely about the same. You know, I'm usually, you know, a lot of our breeding's
[01:45:53.380 --> 01:46:00.820]  done indoors. So I'm usually in like a little bit higher density, like one to 12, you know,
[01:46:00.820 --> 01:46:06.660]  some of the smaller plants, but, you know, they're usually, you know, indoors, I'd say, you know,
[01:46:07.860 --> 01:46:14.820]  three to four feet tall, you know, like it's same vegem for, you know, two to three weeks. And
[01:46:16.660 --> 01:46:20.660]  again, it just depends on the, you know, the process of how much you're trying to really
[01:46:20.660 --> 01:46:26.980]  pollinate. Yeah, I mean, also, if you're trying to make a room full of seeds, it's not a bad idea to
[01:46:28.020 --> 01:46:36.580]  clone your plant, make some backup pollen and apply it. I believe Ken Arado uses, you know,
[01:46:36.580 --> 01:46:41.860]  pollen with a lot of his grows where he's applied it. And he was telling me a lot about that. And
[01:46:42.420 --> 01:46:46.180]  that's kind of where I started doing it was because he said it, and it just makes sense
[01:46:46.740 --> 01:46:50.660]  where you actually take your stored pollen, and then I use it as a redundancy. So
[01:46:51.220 --> 01:46:56.260]  if my reversals on my fem doesn't hit very well, at least I have that backup, I have that mason jar
[01:46:56.260 --> 01:47:00.740]  full of pollen, I can go in the room and I can make a lot of seeds with it. Yeah, definitely.
[01:47:00.740 --> 01:47:06.500]  That was one of the, the fem is new to me. You know, my breeding experience has really just been
[01:47:06.500 --> 01:47:11.540]  with male and females, but working with him for the last couple years, was one of the things that he,
[01:47:11.780 --> 01:47:19.060]  he always really pushed was having some sort of backup because, you know, sometimes that
[01:47:19.060 --> 01:47:24.340]  pollen isn't viable, or it doesn't, you know, I've also seen it not really, you know, put out any
[01:47:24.340 --> 01:47:29.940]  pollen when you're doing reversals. Or it puts out just enough pollen to fuck up the room to where
[01:47:29.940 --> 01:47:38.820]  you don't have seeds for sale. Yeah, I've seen both. And the thing is, is with the seed making
[01:47:38.820 --> 01:47:45.220]  process, the second you try to start separating the seeds, your plant material doesn't work great
[01:47:45.220 --> 01:47:50.020]  for doing anything with, you know, you can say, Oh, we'll make fresh frozen with it, if it has
[01:47:50.020 --> 01:47:54.820]  some seeds, but you can really screw yourself in those types of situations. You want a lot of seeds
[01:47:54.820 --> 01:48:06.900]  or no seeds, there's not a happy medium in there. Yep. So the Lone Stoner asked, and I, like the
[01:48:06.900 --> 01:48:12.020]  chat was streaming, but a couple comments and questions, the best method to reverse a female,
[01:48:12.740 --> 01:48:18.260]  sorry, non sprayed method of reversed in and then I have two female cuts that I want to reverse
[01:48:18.260 --> 01:48:26.500]  both and pollinate each other. Yeah, there's so many ways to skin a cat. I use nano silver. Now
[01:48:26.500 --> 01:48:35.540]  my friend Tim developed a nano silver and I've used colloidal silver. I've used STS, STS works great.
[01:48:37.380 --> 01:48:42.820]  You know, it's like the ratios that you can get online STS, but it's also about experimenting
[01:48:42.820 --> 01:48:48.660]  with that cultivar spray times. The nano silver is very straightforward. It's like you spray it
[01:48:48.660 --> 01:48:53.700]  either every day or every other day, depending on how hard is it to reverse or how hard it is to
[01:48:53.700 --> 01:49:00.100]  reverse. And it pretty much reverses everything. STS was a staple for a long time. You know, I've
[01:49:00.100 --> 01:49:05.460]  used some GA3 along with that, but as far as I've never reversed things without spraying it.
[01:49:05.460 --> 01:49:12.020]  That's just a fact for me. Now you can stress plants out and reverse them, I guess, but as long
[01:49:12.020 --> 01:49:19.220]  as you're trying to get a repeatable result, I would say you want to use STS or colloidal silver.
[01:49:19.220 --> 01:49:24.980]  Those are readily available products. You can search in Google and find out about how to use
[01:49:24.980 --> 01:49:33.380]  them. And also my book is coming out, so I'm going into all that stuff. So yeah, you'll be able to
[01:49:33.380 --> 01:49:39.780]  make your own stabilized silver. We have a recipe that shows you how to do that.
[01:49:40.500 --> 01:49:46.820]  And yeah, you got to keep it refrigerated. Whereas actually we have a new version that's
[01:49:46.820 --> 01:49:52.580]  not in the book, but it's a shelf stable one milliliter to one gallon. Super easy to apply.
[01:49:53.540 --> 01:50:02.980]  Yeah, I've never been able to, on purpose anyway, been able to reverse anything without spraying it.
[01:50:02.980 --> 01:50:06.900]  So yeah, we've used STS mostly.
[01:50:11.540 --> 01:50:13.700]  Yeah, I mean, you can try using light leaks.
[01:50:13.780 --> 01:50:18.900]  Unstable plants will, you know, they'll definitely have intersexual traits and
[01:50:18.900 --> 01:50:24.580]  you can cause hermaphrodism from stress. You know, and one of the things I do is I stress test.
[01:50:24.580 --> 01:50:27.940]  I'm a big believer of stress testing. I was actually talking to one of my friends about
[01:50:27.940 --> 01:50:32.740]  this the other day, but not to get off subject, but stress testing and how important it is with
[01:50:32.740 --> 01:50:38.580]  breeding when you're doing selections for your progeny. Not only are you looking for those
[01:50:38.660 --> 01:50:43.700]  unicorns, but also stress testing your keepers. You know, I think that's a huge thing that we're
[01:50:43.700 --> 01:50:48.420]  all going to be doing in the future. You know, a lot of guys, there's other people doing it now,
[01:50:48.420 --> 01:50:52.900]  not really talking about it, but stress testing is so important, especially when you're talking
[01:50:52.900 --> 01:50:59.620]  about stable lines. You can change the temperature and humidity, especially if you're trying to grow
[01:50:59.620 --> 01:51:06.740]  for things like botrytis resistance and, you know, cancer resistance. So, you know,
[01:51:07.700 --> 01:51:11.780]  you know, PPM resistance, you can add humidity to the room.
[01:51:12.820 --> 01:51:19.540]  A lot of fun stuff like that with breeding and stress testing. I can't stress enough how important
[01:51:21.140 --> 01:51:27.780]  it is. I agree. That's one of the things that, you know, we really, you know, being a nursery,
[01:51:28.100 --> 01:51:37.700]  I think it's important to understand, you know, how a genetic handles certain types of stress.
[01:51:37.700 --> 01:51:44.100]  We're lucky that, you know, Yolo County, where our farm is, we'll put out, you know, we'll go
[01:51:44.100 --> 01:51:49.460]  through a lot of stress just with the enormous temperature swings we get out there. You know,
[01:51:49.460 --> 01:51:56.020]  it'll be triple digits and, you know, back down to, you know, 60 at night and we'll see like 40,
[01:51:56.020 --> 01:52:02.180]  50, you know, degree temperature swings at some points of the year. So I think it's very important
[01:52:02.180 --> 01:52:12.500]  to do. So one thing just quickly, since we keep talking about the book, what's the estimated
[01:52:12.500 --> 01:52:18.180]  release date and what's it going to be called? It's called Cannabis Breeding and we don't have a
[01:52:18.820 --> 01:52:23.540]  specific date. It's going to be next year sometime early next year. The whole COVID
[01:52:23.540 --> 01:52:28.100]  thing has kind of thrown us off. I got a co-author. His name is Greg Zeman, who's helped Ed
[01:52:28.100 --> 01:52:33.140]  Rosenthal write some of the books. I'm giving him full credit for all the stuff he's helped me with.
[01:52:33.140 --> 01:52:37.540]  The guys, the guy's a great writer. I write stuff and he makes my words sound a lot better.
[01:52:39.140 --> 01:52:44.020]  You know, it's been great, great working with the co-author. He doesn't have a lot of breeding
[01:52:44.020 --> 01:52:50.740]  experience. He's helped me with some of my projects as of late. You know, we did a 600-seat room
[01:52:51.540 --> 01:52:55.300]  and he got to be involved with that. But yeah, we're looking at sometime next year. I'll be
[01:52:55.300 --> 01:52:59.860]  announcing stuff in the future. And you know, Peter and I have kind of been talking about
[01:52:59.860 --> 01:53:04.900]  doing some specials about the book, you know, on different chapters, kind of going over some of the
[01:53:04.900 --> 01:53:10.100]  live stuff. So people that are excited about the book, we'll be releasing some of the stuff on the
[01:53:10.100 --> 01:53:18.420]  show. Well, we can also do the video course version of the book. Yes, we can. So for those who don't
[01:53:18.420 --> 01:53:25.300]  feel like reading, they can watch like 12 hours of... You could even do the audiobook version.
[01:53:26.900 --> 01:53:30.660]  We could pick someone famous to narrate it. Sean Connery.
[01:53:33.860 --> 01:53:34.820]  I would love the audio.
[01:53:38.420 --> 01:53:39.860]  Morgan Freeman would work as well.
[01:53:43.620 --> 01:53:45.620]  Sorry, let me go back to my tiny font.
[01:53:48.660 --> 01:53:54.180]  420 Cakes asked a while ago, what about ozone water for everything? And then I guess I'd throw
[01:53:54.180 --> 01:54:05.460]  Kangen in there too. Have you guys played with any kind of water besides RO and well water and tap water?
[01:54:08.020 --> 01:54:12.020]  I haven't. I don't know about you, James, but I haven't really.
[01:54:13.220 --> 01:54:17.940]  No, I mean, I'm big on filtering water. I think, you know, filtered water, there's all kinds of,
[01:54:18.340 --> 01:54:24.500]  things you can filter out. I'm not a huge fan of RO personally because of the waste. There's a lot
[01:54:24.500 --> 01:54:30.900]  of water waste that goes on with RO. We got some guys coming on in the next couple of weeks.
[01:54:31.780 --> 01:54:37.780]  They haven't confirmed yet. We're definitely going to be talking about water building systems.
[01:54:38.980 --> 01:54:43.700]  I got Autumn from Cultivo coming on. I'm not sure when she's coming on. She can discuss a lot of
[01:54:43.700 --> 01:54:52.550]  this stuff as well. Okay. So we're on the home stretch. I think two hours is kind of a nice
[01:54:55.030 --> 01:55:08.650]  show length. Sorry. So Gradu92 asked, any genetics you know of that imitate
[01:55:08.650 --> 01:55:16.670]  flower at 14, 15 hours of light and finish in eight weeks? Finish in eight weeks. And
[01:55:16.750 --> 01:55:21.390]  they, what do you say? They initiate flower in 14 hours of light?
[01:55:22.750 --> 01:55:25.710]  Yeah. I think initiate's probably, yeah. That makes more sense than
[01:55:25.710 --> 01:55:33.230]  imitate. Initiate flower at 14, 15 hours of light. I wonder what invite, let me just ask
[01:55:33.230 --> 01:55:38.190]  Gradu where they live, but go for it. Oregon Diesel, we talked about it on the
[01:55:38.190 --> 01:55:44.350]  show last week. It's a great cultivar and it goes into flower anything below about 20 hours worth
[01:55:44.350 --> 01:55:50.190]  of light. Blue Dream is a little bit longer of a finisher, but that is another one.
[01:55:50.190 --> 01:55:54.670]  Like when I had Blue Dream in my mom rooms, I had to always have them on 24 hours of light.
[01:55:55.870 --> 01:56:01.870]  So there's other ones. I usually, I keep mine at 12, 12 when flowering, except for auto flowers.
[01:56:01.870 --> 01:56:08.030]  I believe that 20 hours of light is ideal if you're doing auto flowers indoors. 18 will suffice
[01:56:08.030 --> 01:56:13.470]  if you're trying to save on electric, but 20 hours of light, you'll get your optimal crop
[01:56:14.590 --> 01:56:19.150]  if you're looking to optimize it. You're going to get more seeds if you do 20 as opposed to 18.
[01:56:21.070 --> 01:56:28.030]  There's a lot of benefits, but as far as cultivars, the only one I can suggest is Oregon Diesel.
[01:56:28.670 --> 01:56:31.550]  Yeah. Gradu's in Midwest Saskatchewan.
[01:56:35.990 --> 01:56:38.390]  Oh, that's where he's at is Saskatchewan. He wants to do a garden.
[01:56:39.430 --> 01:56:46.230]  Yeah. Yeah. Oregon Diesel. I think the clones can be available at, I'm sure
[01:56:46.790 --> 01:56:51.750]  Odie from Homegrown Natural Wonders is going to have seeds out eventually of that variety.
[01:56:54.070 --> 01:56:59.350]  Auto flowers is another good solution. You know, auto flowers, they trigger regardless of light.
[01:56:59.350 --> 01:57:04.870]  You just use more plant density as far as if you're doing an outdoor crop to get larger yields,
[01:57:04.870 --> 01:57:10.470]  but they can be just as effective and the quality has gone way up on autos as opposed to how they
[01:57:10.550 --> 01:57:14.630]  were five years ago. Thanks to a handful of really good breeders.
[01:57:18.060 --> 01:57:23.100]  Robert Pennington asked, what strength PPM is the nano silver spray?
[01:57:25.420 --> 01:57:31.740]  Oh, it's not. It's not like your tradition. It's nano particles. It doesn't even test
[01:57:32.300 --> 01:57:35.340]  because we're talking about one milliliter that goes into a whole gallon.
[01:57:36.140 --> 01:57:40.780]  So that one milliliter is enough nano silver in there to reverse the plants.
[01:57:42.220 --> 01:57:45.740]  So, and if you want more information on it, send me an email with your questions.
[01:57:47.340 --> 01:57:53.340]  JamesLabGenetics at gmail.com. I can accommodate your questions on there. And, you know,
[01:57:54.460 --> 01:57:59.820]  it's a really good product. I love the fact that it reverses plants so easily. And it's so simple.
[01:57:59.820 --> 01:58:06.780]  It's really kind of foolproof in that sense. So there's concerns also, you know, as far as like,
[01:58:06.780 --> 01:58:13.740]  if you're doing reversals in the field, UV light plays a role in problematic reversals. But,
[01:58:13.740 --> 01:58:17.980]  you know, if you're using an indoor environment where you have to worry about the UV light
[01:58:17.980 --> 01:58:23.260]  and then moving them outdoors, that's ideal. But yeah, Tim Humiston, one of my friends and
[01:58:23.260 --> 01:58:28.940]  business partners, he is a wealth of knowledge. He'll be on the show in the next couple of weeks,
[01:58:28.940 --> 01:58:32.700]  I believe. So we can talk more about the nano silver then as well.
[01:58:33.260 --> 01:58:40.860]  So we touched on this in past shows, but Tasty Worms Herbs asked a couple times,
[01:58:41.580 --> 01:58:43.260]  your method for collecting pollen.
[01:58:45.020 --> 01:58:51.900]  Okay, there's several ways to collect pollen. You can use sheet pans and you can take the sheet
[01:58:51.900 --> 01:58:57.340]  pans on parchment paper. I like parchment paper personally, because there's no static electricity.
[01:58:58.220 --> 01:59:06.060]  And you can actually collect the pollen that way. You can build a big collar around your plant.
[01:59:07.820 --> 01:59:12.780]  And with that collar, you could staple it with parchment paper or other things,
[01:59:12.780 --> 01:59:17.020]  depending on the size of your plant, and then you can shake it. Some people take,
[01:59:18.620 --> 01:59:24.780]  there's just so many ways to do it, you know, but shaking it in paper bags work fine as well,
[01:59:24.780 --> 01:59:33.500]  taking your plant and then storing them in mason jars. That works great as well.
[01:59:38.580 --> 01:59:44.100]  And then I like to end on this one. This is from the GoPro pros.
[01:59:45.140 --> 01:59:49.940]  And this is for both of you. What's your opinion on THC infused condoms?
[01:59:53.220 --> 01:59:54.740]  And do you have any experience with them?
[01:59:57.300 --> 02:00:05.460]  No, no. Great question. But yeah, THC. I didn't even know that was a thing.
[02:00:06.020 --> 02:00:08.660]  That's the first thing I've heard about it too.
[02:00:09.700 --> 02:00:11.300]  Totally surprised people with that shit.
[02:00:14.820 --> 02:00:18.180]  I've been married for 13 years. Those things don't exist anymore for me.
[02:00:18.660 --> 02:00:28.980]  Right. But all right. Well, it is now 1pm on the West Coast, 4pm on the East Coast.
[02:00:28.980 --> 02:00:29.940]  We wrap on that.
[02:00:30.820 --> 02:00:35.700]  Sounds great. Thank you for coming on the show, Chris. And I really appreciate it. It's great.
[02:00:35.700 --> 02:00:36.980]  And I'll see you sometime next week.
[02:00:37.780 --> 02:00:40.820]  Yeah, thanks, James. Thanks, Peter. I appreciate it. Thanks for letting me
[02:00:41.620 --> 02:00:49.860]  tell some stories. And it's always a pleasure. I got some of the GMO and sage and sour going that
[02:00:49.860 --> 02:00:55.220]  you gave to us at the Emerald last year. So you'll be able to see some of it right now.
[02:00:55.780 --> 02:00:58.100]  Fantastic. I'm looking forward to it.
[02:00:58.100 --> 02:01:03.700]  Cool. And then we'll let everyone know in the next couple of days, your next week's
[02:01:04.660 --> 02:01:12.500]  Sunday mornings at 11, the GM's loud show. Next week's guest, we'll let you all know shortly.
[02:01:14.180 --> 02:01:17.780]  And with that, I will kill the live stream. So thanks, everybody.
[02:01:18.500 --> 02:01:19.780]  Thank you.
