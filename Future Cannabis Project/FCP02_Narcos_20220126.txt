people I have I queued up do you know the narc the the the narcos meme no let
me see if I can get it hold on let me put it give me one second this one hold
on I gotta share my screen that one oh yeah I do know that one okay yeah that
that's what I was gonna post on Instagram to announce that we are among
other things talking Narcos I figured we could start there but I have all sorts
of other things you're you're our you're our chief Hollywood correspondent Adam
Fischbach what do you have for us today Adam so and that's actually so first of
all I'm gonna conveniently one of the breeders I worked with just sent me a
whole lot of stuff he is growing out right now so eventually you will smoke
some of this but in the meantime I'm gonna I'm gonna get started but uh so I
don't know if we want to talk Narcos first or just kind of big picture stuff
cuz like my whole thing right now is kind of just watching over time kind of
the the evolution and transition from kind of like cable television which is
what we grew up with which is like you know all the cool stuff you know you had
like NBC and the sitcoms and oh yeah sports programming and you know then you
have like the HBO's of the world coming out with a rid you know for you know the
evolution of HBO from like just like regurgitating movies to then like
original programming yeah and I think it's interesting that um you know as
Netflix came along and you know like you think of carriage license and like the
negotiations so like the Disney has you know they have ESPN which I assume is
their crown jewel and then like ABC and things like that yeah but you have kind
of this and I think now we've kind of broken past it but I remember in the
beginning of things like Netflix where it's like why wouldn't an HBO just
start subscriptions like you know this is probably ten years ago yeah and it's
like because they they value the you know those carriage deals that the
subscriber stuff too much you know and I just remember like the beginning of if
you have cable in your home and so this for me was like in Massachusetts and
Rhode Island you can log on to like you know NBC's website and do like the
authentication but it was such a shitty round trip like you know pick your cable
provider oh my god yeah and and I feel like now you know fast forward to like
Netflix Disney Hulu Amazon Apple like yeah for a consumer and I feel like
COVID kind of throttled a little bit because there's probably less production
in the past two years but like right before COVID it was like everyone was
throwing billions of dollars into original programming yeah which for us
as consumers was awesome I assume for you as a producer was like fuck yeah
like yeah everybody wants to fund my shit so yeah you know it's interesting
the the good thing about the television business or you know I guess now though
you know the long television is almost become an antiquated term right because
so many people are probably watching on the computer on their phone you know
that business during COVID obviously there was a period from like March to
you know 2020 to July we're basically like everything shut down and but for
like a couple of like things where people were doing these like kind of
either zoom type you know movies or you know we're gonna make a movie with like
three people and it'll all be you know basically like the NBA bubble and but
production was significantly hampered and then from July to you know more
toward the fall and you know going into the winter that was when shows that
were either in the middle of production and shut down or were things that were
already on the air were getting put back up right because it was easier to do
that but you know as things continued what you know obviously people found is
that the demand hadn't changed right people the movie business and sort of
the theatrical business I think has forever changed you know because I do
think that I'm not sure we're going to go back to the same number of movies in
the theater that we were pre pandemic but on the television side people were
you know there's a lot of shows that really broke out and we had we had two
shows you know one of which was the show called Love Victor on Hulu the other
show at my former company called Dave both were like huge breakout hits and I
think part of it was it came at a moment where people really wanted
content and who were sitting at home and they needed stuff so the demand hasn't
changed and so now that we're back on the other side of things you know
production is up and running like there is there isn't a sense on the TV side of
like oh we're going to make less because people are watching just as much if not
more than they were why I would think it I mean I can speak from my own
experience of like sitting in my garage and producing shit on YouTube I'm like
y'all got nothing better to do like you got to watch me so I think everyone's
like desperate for content right that's right and and I think that like you know
obviously on the movie side you know Apple's making more movies and HBO Max
is gonna have you know all that stuff you know I think we'll pick back up but
but I do think you're right that the overall trend there was this really
unique point maybe a year or two ago where it sort of reached its peak before
it went on the other end where there were all these streamers that were
coming in with new shows and it was like Netflix and Amazon they're just like
green lighting stuff and then on top of that you had all the traditional cable
networks that were also making shows so like TNT and TBS and Paramount Network
and all these places and so there was this moment in time where it was like it
was truly like a boomtown it just felt like there were so many different buyers
if you were taking out a show you know there were so many different places to
shop it to and now I think you're on the other side of that because there is a
consolidation so you know AT&T right or now it's you know WarnerMedia used to
have all these different channels on cable plus they had the premium cable
plus they had they had this new streaming service right and so you could
sell to TNT, TBS, HBO Max, you know HBO and now it's just gonna all be HBO Max
right it's like you know even the original HBO shows when they advertised
and they advertised them as HBO Max there really isn't as much of a change
and that's what all these places I think are going to gravitate toward like
you know it used to be USA Sci-Fi and now it's gonna just be Peacock right or
and so just to give people context you're saying within one overarching
corporation yeah you as a producer could pitch like all their different
subnetworks and like you get turned down by three but pitch the fourth and they
could green light a project now it's all consolidating into like single
decision maker yeah and that's because that's what ultimately I think the trend
is going to be toward is people are gonna cut the cord they're gonna sign up
for these streaming services that we're gonna provide all of you know all of
that you know conglomerates content and there may be some differentiations like
you know Disney will always have I think or you know for the time certainly for
the foreseeable future Disney plus and Hulu and ESPN plus right there they
each provide very different services now you can bundle them and you you know I
have the bundle that you get all you know you can kind of get all of them but
it's definitely different than it once was in terms of how many buyers there
are but they're still making a ton of stuff because they have to justify you
spending you know now it was you know $9.99 it's you know Netflix I think is
now like 20 bucks it's creeping up so there's definitely still a boom of
content but it's it's it's shifting a little bit like I think there'll be less
buyers rather than it was just a trend we're just more more more more more I
think now we're kind of seeing the other side of that what what I don't know if
you can mention names but uh like three or four years ago what were some examples
of like projects that got the green light where everybody in the industry
was like holy fuck like how'd that get like there's just too much money going
around like and shit like that getting green lit is proof of you know it's
funny I think that there was never I there's never I think there's never like
an industry collective like oh my god how could they green light this show
right what I think that it ended up being for a while and this is shifted is
that you know for the Netflix's and Amazon's of the world particularly
Netflix early on they were looking for okay if you can if you can have a big
star that you we can bring like you're gonna get a show right so like house of
cards was that and you know narcos to a certain extent I think was their big
glad am the big glad am push right it was a huge idea can you see that comment
anything Seth Rogen three years ago it's like okay really good yeah people were
there is a little too much Seth Rogen maybe yeah yeah but there was but but I
think that there was always you know I think the shift now which is probably
for the best is that you know every and the big the big thing for selling a show
is like if you got this star to be in a TV show that's a big deal right like
Kevin you know at the time house of cards like Kevin Spacey is doing a TV
show what's that what are you seeing more movie actors movie like who did I
see in a TV commercial like two days ago it was like a big-name actor I mean a lot
of them like Matt Damon's doing the crypto stuff for like like yeah TV
commercials which you never used to see well there's the commercial things which
I think it used to be I mean there was always this like every star did print
ads in like different countries and I was gonna say they do them in like Japan
right like and now obviously everything's so global but I think that
the biggest you know it was this idea of like oh my god this person's doing
television and now but for maybe like a select few people everyone's open to
doing a limited series right at the very least right like you know the
morning show is like Steve Carl Jennifer Azzar Reese Witherspoon you know did
multiple seasons and because I think the the lines are all blurred and you know
half of the movies getting made are on the same streaming service as these
shows so like really what's the difference and so it used to have this
power that if you had a star it was guaranteed right someone's gonna it's
like oh yeah you got this person like I don't care what it is like it's gonna go
and now I you know what is probably best for obviously the consumer is like
it's no it's got to be we know we can get a star so now it's like is it good
is it you know is it gonna is it gonna make noise is it gonna you know is it
gonna cut through because that's the other change right is that it used to be
like I remember when I was a kid and I was like a you know a film and TV nerd I
would like study the fall TV schedule and I would know like every show that
was like gonna air like the 8 o'clock 830 9 o'clock block and I was like I
read up on it and all that stuff and now there's just like so much like there's
just so many things that that you you really need it to be good to break
through you know I think there's not a lot of shows that everyone talks about
that's bad right there's not because it used to be that like you know there were
bombs right everyone was anticipating this new show to come out like I remember
when like the friend spin-off Joey was like you know it's like everyone was
like super excited about it's like of course his friends and it didn't work
and it was like oh my god Joey's not working and now you know now shows come
and go and they kind of just disappear it's like these things pop up and well
so that's the that's the annoying thing about like a net I mean Netflix is
really the only one I subscribe to so like I think like turn do you remember
turn like the Civil War or the Revolutionary War yeah it's like they'll
come and go and you're just like fuck you like and they're like sorry it's
like not hitting our numbers it's you know it's so interesting now I mean
there's like they all have their formulas for which shows you know work
and don't work and part of it is a factor but you know how much it costs
them it's more expensive it really needs to have more eyeballs but the other thing
that I would say yeah by the way have you watched any of those I haven't I
gotta I'm gonna go on a YouTube deep dive after this but I think that the you
know the interesting the interesting change now is definitely the shows that
I hear about from my friend like the recommendation factor and why shows like
squid game which was a rise of South Korean show it's because I think people
in the absence of major marketing spends telling us what to watch it
really is word-of-mouth it's friends telling friends and so I think that's
the thing now that you know I don't really sit down to watch a show that's
not good because usually my I mean for my job I'll watch a pilot or watch first
episode just to know what's out there but for the most part like the shows
that I choose to watch our recommendations from friends versus oh my
god I saw this advertised everywhere and so I'm going to watch it I think the
thing that's been sort of that I I almost feel like isn't it kind of true
that when you see a huge marketing budget behind like a Hollywood
blockbuster movie I mean I think they all kind of have it but like a lot of
times they'll try to do that for a really bad movie because they'll be like
we're gonna make our money in the first three days before everybody realizes
it's bad and then we'll just be like movies are entirely different right
because movies are well at least right now the theatrical movie business is
based on that opening weekend and you put a ton of money into it because that
is where that is you know very few movies will grow from there you know it's
just like there's Titanic was that right but for the most part you know so you
need to just put everything and watch everyone watched it whether it's good or
bad like it's the movie going case is different I still think and we'll see
how the pandemic affected it but before then and I think you know like spider-man
is still gonna I think the six highest gross movie of all time people like
everyone had to watch spider-man and it was good right so it paid off in that
way for TV I think you know that doesn't exist and being in there in the room on
the marketing for some shows like you know Netflix for example unlike movies
which like you would know like I know Batman the new Batman is coming out in
March I've known that for a year because it's been set up and everything the
strategy for these streamers is they actually put almost all their marketing
the week before it's gonna air because this this is for like a Netflix yes
we're off the movies okay yeah yeah so movies we all know right movies the
trailer comes out you get really excited about you're like oh I gotta wait till
fall you know fall 2022 to see this movie like I can't you know and there's
more stuff and they they tease you for it like like you with Joey when it came
out back in the day I was like for you but the but you know for for for tell
you know for the streamers there's philosophy which is really interesting
is they want if you if if they're if you see the ad for it they don't want you to
have to wait a long time to watch it they want you to see it and then do it
and obviously their metrics is not how much it did in the opening weekend it's
how much it did over the first like 12 weeks and and you know there's also
every new season people who hadn't seen the first season unlike how it used to
be where it's like oh I you know I didn't watch the first season Sopranos
I'll catch up on season two you know you you no one starts watching the second
season on Netflix they if they've discovered a show they'll start from the
beginning it'll go that way so it's an entirely different metrics for doing it
but I would say the one thing that I think I miss and I think that like some
networks do this and some networks don't and I actually prefer you know
it's against a lot of what consumers say they want is I actually miss episodes
dropping weekly because I do think that that's the one thing that's been lost in
like the binge model is that there was this collective experience and the last
time it really happened was Game of Thrones right where when Game of Thrones
ended everyone was watching it at the same time like you knew like if you came
in to work on Monday morning and someone was like hey last night's Game of
Thrones were like I haven't seen it they're like you know fuck you get off
the zoo like we're talking about it cuz it's that you know it's that it's it's
that and that doesn't you know happen because obviously when you drop
something that night some people watch it the next day and some people don't
and you know you can't talk about it you don't know people aren't anticipating it
Disney Plus drops does do weekly drops and I remember when like WandaVision
came out you know not to the same extent of like everyone was watching Game of
Thrones but there was this kind of fun sense of like did you watch last night's
and you'd go online you read the recaps of it and you get excited about it and I
do miss that I think some networks are going to that model and others you know
Netflix will never I think they are very much like that binging was their thing
and they'll stick to that it's like blowing your load all in the beginning
and I will say exactly right the big the first you know I remember sort of
going back to Narcos so when we dropped Narcos we had no idea that that was 2014
or what year was that it was 20 it was 2015
we shot it in 2014 it was actually funny I I got I shut I went to Columbia we
shot the first episode and I went got married had my honeymoon and then came
back like the next weekend and came back but I remember when it went with your
wife or she stayed behind she stayed behind yeah she stayed behind so you're
like that wedding was amazing I'll see you in a month well luckily we had the
like also the two-week honeymoon so it's like we had our and I was like I'm gonna
disconnect not not think about you know drugs or or cartels and then and then
return but when that show came out the fun thing about that it was early days
is you just don't know if it's gonna be a thing and you we watched it as like on
Twitter like we were following Twitter and like we're just seeing like so you
guys were nervous we were like yeah I don't even think about that you didn't
know it's gonna be like you were like this is fucking awesome this is like
super early days Netflix right so it's like we didn't even know like would
people watch it first like are people gonna get it it's half in Spanish like
you know that that was something that at the time I I love that I I hate when
they do like the everybody's speaking in English well that's change you know I
think that the one thing that narcos I think did pave the way for is that
people would watch subtitles and I think that like there's also the added thing
of you know and I'm you know I'm guilty of this sometimes you know when you're
watching stuff you're double screening it right you're on your phone you're
like watching you can't do that with subtitles right you have to be fully
paying attention to it and it's like it's an insidious way to get people to
know that they're that you know they they know all the stuff that happens
especially because it's on a tiny phone so you can't be like you know quickly
glance up at a big screen you can't do that so but I remember watching it and
then for that you know this first couple weeks there is nothing cooler than
seeing like people are talking about then like Oh blue checkmark people are
talking about it and it's on what we're did did Netflix make like some sort of
like dashboard available to you guys where you could monitor or like how did
you as the producers get that feedback of like just like monitoring Twitter and
checking Twitter and then like it was fun I mean it was like we were text each
other like oh my god for me like the pinnacle was like Howard Stern talked
about Narcos we're just like mind blown right and like you know this person
tweeted about Narcos and it was like and then it just became like a thing and you
and and it was an amazing burst of just like wow but then it goes away right
it's like a few weeks later it's like people move on to the next thing but you
know and then we kept making the show and I think that and and and it was
never quite like that first moment of oh my god this is really this is like
people are actually discovering this thing right like you know we didn't know
if people would and critically you know in the US because at the time Netflix
was global and everything this could just be this could equally be a show in
Latin America right it could be the show that in the US people you know some
people watch and it ended up becoming something global and and I think you
know towards as we went further along Netflix was great at talking about you
know where it was popular and it's just interesting like different countries you
know that that that have discovered it what was it popular in Colombia so
Colombia was interesting I mean I think people definitely watched it for Colombia
it was a story that had been told there had been a Colombian kind of like soap
opera is like it would be a pejorative term for it because it was you know
definitely had had some interesting things and it's on Netflix and it was a
Pablo Escobar story before Narcos right and it was a in Colombia and so for them
I think it was like our the reaction I think at first was like why are you
telling this story again like it's been told like what's what are you trying to
you know it's like what's okay like I guess another Pablo Escobar thing and I
think that like it's also the thing about it from a from just like an
immediate shock perspective is the guy Wagner who played Pablo who is truly one
of the best human beings in the planet and obviously was the thing that every
he just embodied that role in such an amazing way but for the first season
he's not his Spanish not a can you tell this story cuz it's amazing well people
I would say you know the first reaction was it's really good I mean no one could
deny it but like the guys in Columbus where I has an act you know he does not
you know it'd be like it'd be like if we were doing any some people by the way
other people who spoke Spanish didn't notice it and this was not a criticism I
guess it would be like if Jean-Claude Van Damme played the president of the
United States in a movie correct right it's it's it's that although he John
Claude Van Damme did play American hero guile and Street Fighter let us not
forget so I don't want to like you know that you know Van Damme but you'd be
like it is that like a where is he from like Switzerland or yeah French right is
that like a Belgium right is that like what's that accent yeah the but but but
I think that by Wagner was so unbelievably good in that role and what
the what the show did for the country I think in terms of creating a production
infrastructure and like nothing that big have been done before then afterwards
you know Tom Cruise made American made there and you know it be and I think
people visit I mean it you know it's an it is a gorgeous country and it's
something that I think you know narcos did cocaine sale a shot through the roof
but that's the thing about you know about Columbia is that they've really
moved they've moved beyond that that period right it's it's a it's a country
that's that's that's kind of gone past that you know the card how like that's a
thing of the past so I think it's it's a it's definitely a stain and it's a dark
period for them but now it's this amazing place that like I would a hundred
percent you know I and I want to go back to go yeah no well I'll bring you
on some weed tours we'll visit some farms excellent excellent yeah it's it's
so so I think they you know and they were so particularly after it hit like
they were so welcoming for us and like you know I think we're really supportive
and really provided the infrastructure for the show and it was like it was a
great three years there and then yeah we moved to Mexico and kind of you know
did though did the whole thing whole thing again but but yeah I mean those
were those first seasons were kind of special I mean that first season when
we're there we're just like you know just feeling like who's gonna discover
this like our people I remember being surprised when they let us do it in
Spanish because like I just like are people gonna do that now I think but
who's they that the production company gave you guys the grant you know Netflix
okay Netflix maybe the green light to do what you wanted they were like yeah
where there other like do they push back on shows on like you can't do that well
because they can you talk about kind of the funding chain like I know is it
Beaumont or no sorry boat yes go months it is the production company that pretty
so do they pitch an idea to it like do they pre do they fund a pilot themselves
or they pitch it to Netflix before spending any money no that was like you
know that was sort of an interesting period in Netflix history which was when
Netflix first started so basically like television economics in the traditional
sense and and this has changed because a lot now the this is consolidated for
most of these places but the traditional economics of television were that there
is the producer who is like the on-the-ground creative person who's
usually you know either packaging the idea or putting together the idea and
you know the the lead sort of person then and believe creative really of that
show who went on to run it for years the sky Eric Newman and you know him and
Jose Padilla who directed the the first two episodes was heavily involved in
that first season and then the creators but was Eric is it you said Eric Newman
yeah was he an employee of Gaumont or was he out his own independent dude
okay this this team of people and it was you know and then these writers you know
Doug Miro and Carl Bernard and Chris Brancato like this those were the
creatives right and they had this this this idea for to do a series look at a
Pablo and then and it was from there from the beginning they had this plan
we'd start with Pablo then we'd move on to Cali and then we move on to Mexico
that was always gonna be and so that was really mapped out so then Gaumont is
the studio so Gaumont technically owns the show and so these guys pitched it to
Gaumont not Netflix well this is actually like I mean this is kind of an
odd example this wouldn't happen now but early on in Netflix's and this is the
the case with all that the streamers when they first started early on when
Netflix first started they were they needed shows but they were building
their infrastructure and so they actually needed a studio to actually do
the on-the-ground producing of the show and then they would license it from the
from the studio so in the case of Narcos actually they heard it like you know
Eric and that team presented the idea to Netflix directly and they were like
we want to do this but we need a studio at the time they were like you know
because they were starting out they needed something what was it was it kind
of like they were still a tech company they were a tech company who are
becoming a con you know who who were just entering you know Narcos was very
early days and so Gaumont also did the show Hemlock Grove for them and so they
were a partner they're like okay we know it's a plug-and-play thing they're an
independent it's easy to kind of bring them into this and so then Gaumont
became the studio and the basic structure of that the way that works is
is Gaumont you know creates the you know produces the show with Netflix's
oversight and then Netflix has the right to air it and then eventually you know
at that time Netflix wasn't global so Gaumont had certain you know they could
sell Narcos in a different country if they wanted to and eventually Netflix
obviously were like well we just as we're growing they just bought it bought
it up and so effectively Narcos will be on Netflix forever but the but Gaumont
is was this you know and I worked at Gaumont and eventually you know my
producing credit came as I sort of you know I worked on the show from the
beginning but you know as I when I took over the creative group there I took on
a more hands-on role and and so and that was the that was sort of the system and
and Netflix was so supportive and really like in terms of pushing back
they're not they were you know their feedback was always smart there was
never a like no you can't do this and like you know there were moments that
were you know that were really unique that you know on the page were you know
the amount of voiceover in that show you know traditionally it's like a voice so
you know that much voiceover means there's something and it's not you know
how can you really have the first two in the first episode is really telling a
story and you're cutting into interludes but they were just like look we trust
that this is going to work it's untraditional and it completely did so
they really at that time were very empowering and it was a small group I
mean I remember you know at the time they had like an office unlike you know
in off Burton way you know within a bigger structure and there's just a few
creative execs would go into the little lobby and have our meetings and now
obviously it's Netflix in terms of how much they do but they were great I mean
it was it was a really I mean the process of making that show was was just
was what we I still stand by one of the best my career just because it was
everyone really had the same goal which and and there wasn't cross purposes and
you know I think now it would be weird to watch a show where the characters
should be speaking the language they would speak and they don't you know I
think Chernobyl was actually kind of an interesting counterpoint to that like
that show I loved and totally worked but that's more of a rarity now like you
know I think you know I'm if you're doing a show and and the language of the
characters is you know people expect that it's gonna be spoken in that way
and I think people really are down to kind of go on a journey and as you can
see from like you know squid game being huge or money heist like people I think
if they had dubbed that squid games well you know it's really funny certain
territories like when we would create the show there is this process called
subs and dubs and and certain territories I think are so used to
dubbing from like going back to like when they'd watch American movies that
like they are used to things being dubbed right and so that for them that's
how they experience the show in America I think people are more subtitle
oriented it's funny I would I would watch I would start watching some of the
Netflix shows like dark I remember the German show and sort of watching it was
in a they were speaking in English and it was dubbed and I like immediately
just totally took me out of it and I like can't and I think that like so so
culturally different people consume I think and are used to a different form
but I think in the US yeah like the subtitle thing is just not it's just not
scary like people are people are game to do it if if they feel like you know if
they feel like it could break out which again like it's totally possible to do
so when when you guys were like going down to Columbia and scout like did
people people in Columbia knew who you were and what you were doing like there's
a movie being made about Pablo pot or a fella he's a guy I know Pablo Escobar we
were not you know the production had a nick had a had a nickname there we
weren't like you know on an every the the government knew what we were doing
and you know they were supportive of us doing it but on like a day-to-day level
we weren't going out of our way saying oh hey we're shooting this Pablo Escobar
show you know I think as it's funny I remember the difference between season
one and season two was you know season one we would kind of be doing our thing
and no one really recognized us and everything season two I remember we were
shooting it and like it was Halloween and like you know Wagner was walking
down the street was getting mobbed you know because it all of a sudden became
you know we weren't so anonymous anymore because people what because people watch
one yeah watch season one and they they had seen they had seen the show and so
it it definitely changed as we went into subsequent seasons like people were you
know people saw the actors they knew what we were doing but I think they were
supportive I mean like look it was it's it's a great boon to the economy you
know to the production economy you know we really employed a lot of we didn't
really fly in a lot of people you know we we we shot the show with Colombian
you know Colombian personnel and they did a kick-ass job so so yeah I think we
were more anonymous season one than that we were you know after that and I I know
I asked this question before but was there a lot of partying going on in
Colombia by cast and crew you know I would say that we it was a fun like it
was a fun crew like we definitely I remember like would you know I remember
the first night there for the first during the first weekend there like one
night you know one of the guys who was part of the Colombian infrastructure was
like yeah we're going to a house party we all like you know went and it was it
was fun but you know the shoot it's a long shoot you know shooting a show it's
you're there for a while it's and so I think eventually it just became you know
people's life you know people move down there for six months and it was more
just the day-to-day of just like you know I think the fun of it is just like
hey we're all here it's great and then eventually it's like yeah this is this
is this is life you know this is what we're doing but we fell into a really
good rhythm and you know I think there was definitely a real camaraderie among
among the people down there because again for the Americans or the people
who are not Colombian it's like you're you know you're living in a foreign
place for a an extended period of time but I think everyone really did have an
affection for the country by the time they left that was the very PG answer to
my question no I wish I would say that then no I guess the short answer was
there was not I wish I could tell you there was like the R-rated like oh my
god everyone's like going fucking nuts is whatever but it really falls
everywhere well you know I think there's also like you know when you're in
production it's tiring like it's you're also you know your call you're waking up
during the week at if you know if you're starting on like a day shoot you
know the actors are getting up at like 4 or 5 in the morning to go in makeup like
you're getting home late you're exhausted and you're doing nights and
it's you know starting at 6 p.m. and ending at 6 a.m. so it's it's also just
like the the rhythms of production are not necessarily conducive to like oh my
god we're gonna party and it's gonna be great it's like it's it's tiring you
know shooting shooting there you know you know we there was a lot of scope to
that show so it was and unlike traditional shows where and this changed
a little bit as we've got you know further along but certainly season one
you know a lot of shows there's a stage there's a set right like I mean
traditional television you know it's it's just all shot on the stage and
there's a case you know a sitcom or a you know traditional drama there's
standing sets you know Narcos didn't really have that we were just going to
locations and shooting shooting it like one big movie and so it was just a lot
there's a lot of travel we we took over what was was there like a yearly budget
and did it increase after year one yeah it I mean there's the I think the first
season we really found how much the show is gonna cost and I think you know it
was but but for the most part yes there was a set budget and it are you allowed
to say what it is like is that a public figure is that like public but it's I
would say cheaper than it was not what how about what's typical not that it was
you guys but what would be a typical cost for an episode of a show of that
caliber at this point I would say if you're looking at a drop like a drama
that you see on television the cost could be anywhere from four to like ten
million dollars an episode Game of Thrones obviously was its own category
well but but but so yeah Game of Thrones but like Narcos also had a ton of like
action scenes and shit that it's not just like two people in a room dialogue
correct and so I would say given that I think we were able to accomplish a lot of
scope on the on the sort of lower end of that spectrum but but we also you know I
think that it was it was a production strategy we shot a lot of handheld we
were you know it was it had like an independent spirit to it that I think
gave it a lot of the texture that I think people responded to and you you
premiered it for the president of Columbia right we did can you tell that
story I would say that the interesting thing about that experience and I was
there and he he was our greatest supporter it was I think I was expecting
a a court like oh my god it was going to be saying like everyone's going nuts
it's going to be amazing it's going to be great and I think that we we got her
ultimately they respected it but I also realized that you know when we first got
there it wasn't you know the reaction was a little bit like what are people
thinking and the truth is what I learned was you know it is a really you know that
period in Colombian history is is a dark period and so I think everyone understood
the value of it but I would say it was it was a it was you know a period it's
like I think it it's not the exact equivalent but I think if you were you
know watching a a movie about you know I'm trying to think of a dark chapter in
American history that's a historical recreation of it I think you'd appreciate
it but it's not the like rousing like yeah like pop like you know it's it's it's it's a
much more real experience I think you know you showed the memes at the beginning you know to
me at the beginning I think Pablo you know what was a cult like figure even before
there you go yeah exactly like and Wagner actually brought such humanity to him that I think this
helped us but like you know Pablo became this figure I think for in America right people dressed
as him for Halloween it was like it was this fun kind of you know antihero but you know I think in
Colombia he was a real person who did some some really bad things and and that's that was always
the unique experience about being in Colombia making it I think is for the people there it had
you know and it wasn't that long ago and so you met people who you know who were affected by it
you know lost people to the violence that you know was due to him and so it's just a different
it was a it was a different experience but I think they they again and which is why I was always so
grateful that they were supportive of it because I think there's a travelogue quality to it for
some American audiences right it's like oh it's fun you get to see Colombia you get to see this
like badass gangster who's like you know who you know who's played by an amazing actor but
obviously he was a real person who who ultimately you know he like he blew up an airplane like I
mean he was he was a he was you know he did a lot of bad things now there were some people in the
country who because he also gave a lot back you know to the community and so you know he's a
divisive figure and you know I think some people I think it probably just depended on your personal
experience or your family's personal experience with him you know whether he donated you know
something in your neighborhood and you know you you viewed it in one way or whether you know you
lost a family member to the violence that you know that was created from uh you know from from his
reign um so it's you know it's an it's an interesting you know because it is relatively
recent history to do a tv show on right like there's not a lot of shows if you think about it
that that are true stories that are set in like the 80s right that you're watching as a
not as a limited series but it's like a show that lasts three seasons per country um so it's yeah
it's it's it's a unique it kind of exists in a unique thing and that's the other thing too
that Netflix is is that you know everyone around the globe is watching at the same time it's not
a thing that americans were watching and then people sort of caught up to you later um so it
was fun actually just kind of getting the global reaction to the show um because it was different
depending on where you were watching that that is actually interesting because historically you'd
hear about things like I think mostly it's going from the U.S. and other directions but like
something is in in the U.K. and people are buzzing about it and they're like only six more months
till you get it in the U.S. Well that was you know there used to be this thing like I remember
when I was you know uh it was years ago but yeah formats you know from around the world you know
they were passed here and you'd get them and you'd be so you know like I don't know if you
watched the show Utopia which Amazon remade as a as a show but the British version was amazing and
I remember seeing it. Where can you watch the British version now? I don't know actually I mean
I watched so I watched the British version on like a you know it was like a it was a burned DVD it
was like a file upload that I I watched and I was like this is like the most amazing thing and again
everyone Hollywood was buzzing about it but I still think most Americans didn't probably watch
it which is a shame because it was it was fantastic and same thing with there is a show Broadchurch
that um was in in the U.K. that also had Hollywood buzzing because we get it early but yeah it now
it's obviously different right because you know people in you know Lupin which was another Gaumont
show right people you know made for France but people were discovering here it's not like there
was any you know early word on it it's just released everywhere and you know people experienced
at the same time which had these global hits happen which never you know could have happened
like the idea of of a French show or a South Korean show or a Spanish show becoming a global phenomenon
or it is you know the Fauda I don't know if you've watched on Netflix was this awesome Israeli show
it's you know it's a thing that everyone collectively watches which is like a very
unique thing uh to this time that just didn't exist or it happened much later right like you
know if you watch the Friends reunion special that show obviously became a global phenomenon but it
wasn't experienced in the same global fashion I think everyone was independently having their
experience did I did I tell you the story of the producer of Friends no Kevin probably shouldn't
say the name but anyway uh the guy so we were in LA uh I had a farmer come uh hang out and bring
what he grew that he grows up in Anza at like 4,000 feet so he has his own appellation and like
we filmed a conversation where he brought all his flour and his hash and a bunch of us sat around
this studio one night just filming filming the whole conversation smoking his weed and uh
it was a music recording studio and we were upstairs in this open area and the guy uh
the recording engineer was doing a session down he was scoring something uh for a documentary
and this old guy kind of like came up the stairs like he had smelled what we were smoking
and he has like this big shit eating grin on his face here I won't make I won't keep you
I won't keep you huge while we're while I'm doing all this everyone's just staring at you but uh
yeah but uh so this guy comes up and he I was like you want to smoke with us and he was like
like don't have to ask me twice and uh so we're like we're all smoking hanging out talking
and then finally he leaves and the next day uh Dave the guy who's the sound engineer goes do
you know who that was and I was like I have no idea and he goes that was Kevin Bright the producer
of Friends yeah and uh I was like that's cool that's cool yeah yeah but uh and I have no idea
how we got on that but oh because you you're talking about Friends yeah well that was the
thing I don't know if you watched that reunion special but like I I thought I did not but I'm
sensing a trend here because you're all about the Joey spinoff you are a Friends fanatic
I wouldn't say fanatic but I would say that was a formative like the NBC like block you know like
the Seinfeld like into Friends right Friends like that was a very formative like you know comedy
touchstone and it's also you know that was Thursday night on NBC right there was an NBC
and Friends was at eight Seinfeld was at nine they would always like rotate to 8 30 and 9 30 shows
but like those were like the cornerstones and they were I mean CBS had some old person uh
like like uh Agatha Christie like Agatha Christie the but those shows by the way the comedy in those
shows completely holds up which is you know which is a testament to those to to that like
you know and obviously Curbed now is kind of the continuation of Seinfeld but um but yeah it's
amazing how it still holds up. Curbed is such a trippy concept it's almost like a best in show like
mockumentary kind of like following the real life of these people who are in a documentary.
It's become its own you know it actually started like if you watch the first Curbed special it
really was like a mockument like you're following him and then it's shifted into this just it's you
know it's just a show about and it's kind of you know it's it's like he's such a specific
personality and and it's amazing how you know that's been going on for a long period of time.
What's the most number of years they've gone between seasons?
There was so there was a a pretty huge gap um I think like two or three seasons ago where he
he was off the air I think like five years it was like a significant chunk of time and now
recently he's been kind of more consistently churning them out um which is great for uh
for me because I'm like I definitely devoured this last season.
Yeah no it was my I was confused because I was like wait didn't Curbed where has like it's kind
of like yeah where did that go like where's it been and then like wait these are new or like am
I just hearing about old stuff that people are just discovering like? They were my understanding
is they were always like it's just as when he wants to make it you know. I mean that's what I
love that like the way I do stuff on YouTube I'm just like there's no rhyme or reason to when I go
live I mean sometimes we try to do stuff at the same times but I'm always like fuck it like let's
go live and it's like whoever's there is there and I feel like that's cool he just kind of does it
whenever he he's like I'll bang out five episodes like I got some fun stuff to do. He'll always
build out a season but I think that there is yeah there there now that's sort of back more on a
cadence but yeah there's a period where it just happened and then you know and then but how how
could if you could have your own like essentially a sitcom where you could be like like could you
imagine any other sitcom where they're like all the actors feel like taking next year off we'll
be back in maybe a couple years and having even the network be like yeah just whenever you're
ready to come back. No you have to be in you're you you have to be in pretty hollowed ground I
mean the the technical reason why that is not uh something that's easy to do like you know Atlanta
which is also the show that I love like that that's been off for a pretty significant chunk of
time um the the reason why it is a challenge to do that from a just a technical standpoint is that
um actors you know you can't hold an actor indefinitely on a show right so like
the way that it works is like after you wrap a season or you after you ever season there is like
a certain chunk of time where the act you have an option to keep the actor for another season um and
then after that point that lapses so for Kerg like obviously like they couldn't guarantee that any of
them were going to come back five years later they couldn't just say like hey Jeff you know it's like
we're doing it you're obligated no matter what you're doing to do it but I think because everyone
loves being on that show it didn't matter right when he was ready to do it everyone made it work
and came back and you know there's some seasons where I think Cheryl was less on it because she
was like on another show and you know and so it just sort of exists for him when he does it I
think everyone just wants to be involved because it's you know it's from by all accounts and black
yeah now he he pulls in like all the a-list uh oh my god yeah I mean that's what I'm saying he has
like the the holy grail like if you were an actor and you were like what would my ideal acting
like lifestyle be like it would be like his lifestyle well it's also great because like
the entire show is shot in like west LA it's like super easy to work on you it's like you know it's
not you know going to a far flung place and you know it's it's it's if you can get a gig where
you're shooting a show in LA it's a it's a pretty it's a pretty nice one I've only been able to do
that uh do that once sorry I'm trying to pick out a winner yes give me one second all right so
with um that's the one this is a meat breath
see what this is all about and you can you can imagine you can visualize yeah
your experience yeah I'm yes I'm sensing it um oh so what well one thing I wanted to ask you
about was kind of like the the trend of and what is it like the multi or the I mean one they're
like the superhero franchises like yes like what are you because I like when we were growing up
there was Superman yes there was like then there was like a Batman and there was like maybe a
Superman too now we're on like Batman 47 with like 16 different types of Batmans or sorry uh
Spider-mans yeah and uh yeah the multi the addition of the multiverse right which is interesting
because both DC and Marvel are doing it at the same time um you know obviously Spider-man most
recent one had you know had had that be a big part of it and then yeah I think the flash is coming up
and I think that's gonna on the DC side you know like Michael Keaton is coming back as Batman and
it's like a so I I read that story of him uh like his reason why he didn't do the next Batman who
was the director it was Tim Burton did we did the first Michael Keaton one but then and then
right so he was saying like I didn't want to work with him did you read that well I I didn't read
that I do know that there you know obviously Tim Burton and Michael Keaton and work together
because they also did Beetlejuice together um and and then yeah I mean there was you know the Batman
and then Nolan came in and obviously you know his trilogy was you know it's going to be a hard one
particularly like the Dark Knight was like I mean one of the better movies period like I think you
know should have should have been nominated and maybe even won that year uh because it was so so
well done Heath Ledger won for it but but yeah I mean I think the super I actually have such a great
admiration for what Marvel has done because it's kind of it's you know over movies and now shows
telling this one story that's all connected like you know you can kind of sit down and not have
seen you know you cannot have seen Avengers and still enjoy Spider-Man but if you haven't then
you're like well why is it was Tony Stark and the first Spider-Man and not the second you know it's
like there's there is um and it was all mapped out right they had this vision for basically doing
movie versions of what comic books are right this this one continuing story through different titles
and crossovers and I'm like I I have you know they're superhero movies but I'm kind of in awe of
what they've done because it's if you take a step back and think about how many shows and movies have
all told this one story like how many different movies all converged into invent Avengers you know
Infinity War and Endgame like it's kind of remarkable and like you know Kevin Feige like
all you know had this idea and had this thing that they're all leading to that place it's uh
it's pretty cool so do we have like the next couple years because I mean I feel like things
what's interesting about the superhero stuff is that I feel like things kind of like have their
peak and of popularity and then they go down and I feel like that's it like keeps going and going
and going you know it'll be it'll be interesting I mean there's no sign of slowing down right
Spider-Man was you know definitely I think made a lot of people think because it's you know I think
it was like it's like the now the number six all time and that was during the pandemic so it's like
there is I do think the theatrical experience is going to be more geared toward those movies right
it's just going to be the and everything else I think will end up being streaming and uh which
you know I is as a moviegoer you know a little sad like I do I do miss you know I have obviously
during the pandemic have really you know not seen a lot of movies in the theater and it's a shame I
mean I you know growing up that was like the thing right that there was nothing better than like going
to a movie and like watching with an audience and having this collective experience and we'll see if
you know things bounce back whether that changes but I do think the difference between then and now
is that and you know we have you know small kids right it's it's when you're at a certain point in
your life it is really hard to go out and see a movie it's like the cost of a babysitter all that
so you can like watch it on your big screen tv and like it's just it's it's definitely a harder
thing to compete with um uh so we'll see yeah I'm curious what I think I have a sense of what the
television industry is going to look like you know I think it's it is going to be that they'll
just be the streamers and you'll you know you'll pick and choose among them which ones you're and
they'll increasingly get more expensive then you'll look around and realize that you're paying
just as much as you were when you had a cable package for all these things uh but for movies
it's the slow boil right and they're slowly gonna get you there and I of course and I still like the
one person who has still has the direct tv subscription just for live sport like sports
even though now I can kind of do that on a streaming thing um but yeah I think eventually
that's kind of where it's going to land for movies I'm not quite sure you know I'm not
quite sure what movie theater you know what that what that will look like uh years from now but do
you see a consolidation of streaming platforms like I mean what's interesting is some of the
biggest tech players are like putting their chips in so you have like it's hard to like like Apple
could lose for a long time and be like we're not gonna give up so like in in cell phones you kind
of have like Verizon and AT&T do you see that I five years out the thing about these companies
you know they're so huge that like you know Netflix and you know Disney and Amazon I mean
they're such massive companies that it's even you know when Disney and Fox merged and that was
kind of a monumental shift that's nothing compared to like Netflix and Disney right like
there is you know they're just so huge that I do think and they also have other business you know
it's like Amazon is being true they're also Amazon you know it's like where I get 90% of all my goods
so like I think that there will always I think I'm not sure there'll be like a mega merger because
you know merging Apple and Amazon is so much more than just merging their shows it's their
massive you know their massive companies so um so I think that they'll what each I think each
conglomerate will have one or two and feed everything into that right like I think you know
Warner I guess will have HBO Max and probably Discovery Plus and they'll and they may keep
those separate um but but yeah I think they'll be just kind of like everyone threw their stuff into
their their thing and you pay it for a subscription the one benefit that's the one benefit of working
on these shows is they usually give kick in a subscription for a year so I get to
save a little on my monthly premiums oh that
was I said just for Netflix like Netflix comps you a year subscription they all know every streamer
I've worked on they were usually pretty good at because they want you to be obviously be able to
watch you know and experience it when you're producing for them so um it's usually you know
early on eventually they're just like yeah Netflix at this point or you know who doesn't have Netflix
right all right so what are what are some uh some streaming shows that have come out in like the past
six months that you're digging show that I love which if everyone has not seen it's a crime
is the show called search party which is on HBO Max it was on TBS um and now it's on HBO Max
and it is it's brilliant I mean it's a show that began as kind of like you know
you know slack not slackers but like sort of millennials or gens somewhere in between I
always lose touch with what they are but basically like salt salt you see that oh
Cobra Kai like I mean that's that's become a behemoth um but yeah that show it just is evolved
every season is kind of its own tone but it's all the same characters it's really I mean it's right
um I really thought WandaVision was fantastic I thought Loki was really good too like those
were those two marvel ships that were really really well executed um Succession is you know
just a gift every episode it's just like something I devoured I love the the father's voice
uh his accent is is amazing and fuck off yeah he he does the uh is it like McDonald's or something
like he does commercials for like McDonald's or that's funny and listening to his voice it's like
uh it's like a new it's like a weird New England I don't even know where the accent's from but it's
like I know it and it's so unique he yeah I mean he every like all those actors it's so rare that
like everyone is at the just top of their game and just like just crack just crushing like I mean
that was a show that like again we watched weekly and like when it that night like we have to watch
the next episode of Succession um I appreciated Euphoria the first season I know the second
season dropped but not I think as a parent it's like the scariest show on television um but uh
but it was it was definitely really well done um I'm trying to think what else and we're
we're in the middle of Search Party right now and really I mean can't recommend it enough not
enough people have seen that show the other two is a show that is really funny uh that was on
Comedy Central and now I think it's on HBMAC also um but yeah I think those those are the
ones that come to mind what about you what are you watching I mean what's interesting is right now
after we talked Narcos and I wanted to do this I was like I need to re-watch the Columbia because
like you forget everything yeah and so it's interesting that I'm going through it a second
time and I'm either so forget it it's partially because like I'm like I don't even really remember
this like I remember the big picture of what happened but I'm totally content going through
content going through it a second time nice good um I watched I want I love like old like
period piece movies like Vikings and like oh yeah yeah uh like I watched uh did you watch Ertugrul
the Turkish like no it was like 300 f it was insane and it was totally wacky it was like
13th century Turkish warrior tribe making their way in like the world of warring tribes
and it was all in Turkish and it was like parts of it were super cheesy but parts of it were like
pretty cool and uh like it was like the age of the crusade so the crusaders were like the bad guys
and uh there was tons of like fighting but also like plot and backstabbing and like double crossing
and uh so anyway that's uh I'm trying to think of some of the other stuff I've watched recently um
what what I don't like is that net I think Netflix like discovery functionality sucks
mm-hmm like there's even stuff like a show I've been watching helping me remember which season I've
finished or like like that there's a new season of something that you watch the first three seasons of
and you probably forgot that there was a next season coming the thing that messes me up is
sometimes I'll turn off the tv but not the apple tv and so like it tells me I've left off somewhere
where I have and then it's impossible that yeah they they could refine there are all the services
I'm sometimes they're not great at like exactly where I left off maybe the user error but I feel
like Netflix is good at that like just like because think of how many times in the day you just get
distracted by shit and you're like oh my god do something and then four hours later it's like the
exact second where you last left off there there's probably the best out of yeah but it's you're
right it's it's it's like easy to fall back into how about movies I watched uh the new James Bond
on uh yeah what what'd you so well what'd you think of it I I liked it I liked it you know I
it was I think the um in the Daniel Craig series I still would probably say my top two are
Casino Royale which I watched recently completely holds up it's fucking awesome and uh and then
Skyfall were like the two gold standards for me because Skyfall was Javier Verdum was a great
villain it was beautifully shot and then Casino Royale was just like a great intro to Bond
um this one was definitely like you know it's a swan song movie which is always a little bit like
more melancholy than I tend to like prefer my bonds but um but it was well done like they did
a good job with it yeah it's funny I watched it on a plane and uh I I landed just as he was like
I I think they were like shooting at that hideout and he was still in it like killing the bad guys
and they were like you know it was basically like we had landed and like it was time to get
off the plane so I was like I like I know how these end yeah and and and then I and then I
tied the center he's like yeah and then when he got killed I was like what I know I know
how does that happen yeah exactly it's a Bond movie you can't kill bot yeah right
so he definitely well I know he he really wanted that to be his last Bond so that was a good way of
doing it well if he kept going he'd be like the the 65 year old James Bond exactly Sean Connery got
up there I mean like the last Bond he was I think he he was on the other side but yeah but he was
like dapper Bond not like action movie Bond I know right like he was I and I missed the suave James
Bond like I appreciate the the Bourne Bond but yeah I think just like the ladies man suave like
almost like Roger Federer like effortless like smooth motions it'll be really interesting to
see who they cast next and whether they go back to that more like you're right the dapper Bond
or like this was this was the Bourne Bond right he was just like a bra more brawler
all right so actually we have can you see that question we're probably gonna shut up yeah so that
was it was a like it was not on the roof where he was actually killed it was like right next to it
like the building over and that was something that like when it was done was very meticulously
meticulously recreated because they're because you know it is something that there's a lot of
photographs of and so you we were able to really mimic it and it was this it was this real moment
because it's like you knew that that's what was coming for two seasons but to actually sort of
finish it and I think it was done you know they did a really good job and I think the way that
it was done was this sort of bittersweet thing of you know chasing this guy and the whole show
is about that and then it happens and then you know next season's Cali Crotale right it was like
it didn't didn't really do and that's sort of the you know I think that what I loved about that
season was just watching him and the second the last episode were sort of him wandering at his own
the last episode were sort of him wandering at his own you know kind of kind of thing was
was really was it was definitely something that was I know emotional for everyone involved
but also was very very deliberately as accurate as as as possible and you know the real life
Pena really you know it was Murphy it was only Murphy that was there and he really was not there
so and that was also kind of held true like the reasons why obviously were a little bit different
we kind of fictionalized oh oh you're talking about at the final scene at the at the final
scene okay so I mean it's interesting that the act so Pena gets kind of played as
like he's striking deals with these guys and hiding it from yeah the Americans but but the
real does the real life guy have to agree with the storyline you're going with him
we told we told them and was he like yeah okay I mean look you know the painting the painting
character you know obviously Pedro Pascal did an amazing job on it but you know I think we
we gave him the heads up and he was like cool I mean like the third season like you know the real
life Pena was not in club you know he was not the lead person against the Cali cartel but at that
point we're just like he's a character we love and why not use him as an avatar for to kind of you
know create a sort of composite character who would take us through their cartel like the guy
you know the guy who took down the cartel is it was real but but yeah I think Pena was always a
little bit was the most fictionalized of all of all the characters that's what I meant I meant
you know the real Murphy and Pena were like super nice guys and and really I think kind of embraced
the show and really supportive they're like what you wanna you wanna like glorify our exploits
yeah cool yeah no they were they were great yeah no I had a oh um
what what like I looked up Pablo Escobar's wife and I was like holy shit like she's like
it's the shit you don't think about like a she's still alive and she lives in Argentina right and
then the mistress the uh news reporter lives in Miami yeah yeah I mean I was gonna try to reach
out to them and have them on as like surprise guests and like and by the way we have them both
backstage yeah they're coming on that would probably not go particularly well but the um
yeah that's I'm gonna I'm gonna make that happen though yeah you've given me a challenge I want to
it's recent and Virginia she you know we fictionalized the the reporter character right
that she was different than the actual person his wife you know obviously was his wife um but uh
but yeah it was it was a uh it was a uh it was weird because like yeah and same thing with Mexico
like a lot of those guys are still alive um and I think that you know in Mexico especially like
they're still you know some of them are still you know in the game and so it was always a little
odd but I think everyone you know narco corridos are like you know the songs about the narcos are
there so like there's a history of kind of of you know dramatizing these guys and I think
from my sense I think they appreciate it because it's kind of cool that what so and just quickly
there are some and I saw the comments earlier uh I don't know there I think there's some
Colombians watching but it was kind of like they were like this is like embarrassing like
I wish we were still at those comments but anyway they they were like this kind of like
stereotypes Colombia and all that stuff and like what it what did the production of narcos do for
the people of Colombia but like and I'll let you answer for yourself but for me I'm kind of like
my dad's Italian and like Italians in media are Al Capone and Tony Soprano and then my mom's German
so it's like the Nazi bad guys in like World War II or like Hogan's Heroes or uh so but but for you
kind of when you think of like what would people of Colombia look at this production as is it
and what did it do for for for the I mean you kind of touch on it before with like just like the
economic stuff yeah look we we you know we it's a big production that moved down there and we
you know we didn't do the thing which was shoot it like in my you know double it for anywhere we
really went down there and I think that you know the other thing too is that the show the show
is not a clear-cut the Americans are the good guys stopping the bad guys right like you know and you
can read interviews with you know with the creators and the director of the show but you know that the
war on drugs is not you know it was it was something that I think is not like the show is a
raw like yeah this was awesome you know I think that the idea of of our us going down there was
not necessarily the best you know the best thing and so I think because it's not like our the the
point of view of the show is the American heroes saved the day and cleaned everything up I think
that there is more of an appreciation for it like I think we really did try to take a more kind of
neutral perspective on it and you know season three especially like you know the guy who's done
the Cali cartel was you know was a Colombian guy who you know was heroic and and I think you know
pain is a part of it but you know I think as the show I think also the dialogue reinforced that
with like the Colombian guys were like look like we don't need your we don't need you as our
benefactor correct like and stop treating us like we're like this needy desperate group of people
and look the Colombian are it's like the demand was coming from the U.S. right like that's where
that's who's consuming it so they were you know they were meeting a demand that was not their own
um and and so yeah it's a complicated picture but I think because we like lived in the complicated
nature of it I think it didn't it allowed us to I think have more support than if it was just like
yeah remember the story about how the Americans came down and killed Pablo Escobar and it was
amazing like then I think that would have a different perspective. USA number one. Yeah exactly
exactly. Yeah no the the U.S. legacy in Latin America in the in the 70s and 80s is not a good
one. We don't have a lot to be proud of uh and the shit that we supported we were like what dictator
like hey like we'll put you we'll we'll we got your back. It's definitely a mixed record I would
say it's a mixed record yeah. Right wing uh what what were those brothers were like not militia but
like what did they call themselves they were like a um an art like a small army what would you call
that? Uh it's kind of a militia I mean like the yeah we we did like America I mean like also
Chile and obviously Pinochet like there's definitely like a yeah I think the U.S.
incursion in that in you know in their meddling I think was not obviously like Iran Contra like
there was definitely like um I think because of the checkered history of the U.S. in kind of their
involvement in it I think we were able to tell like a much more worldly view of it versus a U.S.
centric view. I always feel like the U.S. shoots itself in the foot with foreign policy like like
we have the biggest thing going for us which is like essentially like it has some warts on it but
like we have a functioning democracy yeah like we we have it like compared to other people and what
they live under like we have it pretty good and uh for me that's what we should be exporting
yeah because any any people doesn't want to be like have a dictator on top of them so it's like
I think the U.S. is probably like in Latin America was like while we know it's a democratically
elected government they're left-leaning we can't have that so we're gonna overthrow them with a
right-wing dictator who is horrific and that was the problem you know the Cold War policy was like
anything socialist or borderline communist was bad and had to get replaced even if that
was served the will of the people who lived there right so anyway I don't know why uh
oh sorry so we have I've been waiting uh I didn't want to lose these
uh no we built that that's cool we built that yeah we built that that what I what what to me
what was ridiculous like that was accurate the deals he struck with the government like he's a
fucking sick negotiator no that's all right so here's what's gonna happen I'm gonna build a
billion dollar luxury hotel we're all living and you can't you can't be within three miles of it
and I can run my drug empire untouched by you from there do we have a deal and they were like
yeah no that sounds good to us well they were so afraid of him I mean like but yeah
that was uh that was that that was meticulously recreated um you know we had a lot of pictures
of the actual one we were able to do that but yeah we built that and then uh Chad had a green
screen question tell me oh wait no it's further up
further up this is way too much attention I gotta focus all right there we go
how is the like the fact that that you can create like you don't even need to go to some
eastern european 14th century city you can just like a green screen the whole thing you can
but I think that there isn't if you truly do a full green screen and like just did everything
it's you know it's like 300 or you know sin city it's such a specific style that I would say that
for the most part we you know shooting on location is preferable so you'd wrap like again
we just went to columbia right and it was easier than building your green so it's like why not
just shoot the whole thing there and so you know and when you you know when you're doing a big
production the green screen technology is amazing in certain scenes it makes sense or you know you
need a character to be in a different location for a scene you don't need to fly there or you
want to do it but for the most part when you're like setting your show in a place you either want
to literally be in the place or build the place because it just gives you more functionality like
doing a show that's green screen heavy unless it's like a sci-fi thing and you're kind of just
along for that ride it's distracting um can you talk about the
the evolution of producer credits and like who gets them and I feel like that the the number
of people who get producer credits is expanding would that be accurate like over the past 15 20
years and then more actors are getting producer credits yeah I would say that in film it's a
little different because film a lot of times it's like a movie is independently financed and it's
put together through like you know you know Alex used to be right there was the studio system so
all movies were made by you know it was a fox movie or warner brothers movie and then you know
with the rise of independent financing for movies you know some movies have like 30 executive
producers because like they were all people who basically contributed money to the show or the
movie and as a result got a credit right that was part of why they did it um in television
I would say it's not as it's not as changed um yes like actor if you are a meaningful enough actor
and you're in a show and especially if you originated the show you'll be an executive
producer on it um but for the most part I would say that if you're an if you are a producer on
the show you're either a writer on the show the director of the show the producer of the show
occasionally you know in my case I you know I was at the studio I was making a show and so
um you know that was kind of where my touch touch point was um but it mostly falls into
that category right like in tv there isn't like as much independently financed television so you
don't have the same movie thing of like there's like 50 executive producers and like what are
they all doing I think in you know there it's it's a little bit more regimented in television
what are kind of the trends in uh
like my assumption is when you get a producer credit you have like a
a longer tail of of like payout from the production it's so that that is like totally
dependent right although I get like I can you just break that stuff down like like a a major actor
gets like paid but then they also get to share in the upside right so can you talk about like
structures for different players in a film or television production everything's different I
would say the main change in television it used to be that like um syndication was like
the like the you know if you had like a sin you know speaking of Seinfeld like Larry David and
Jerry Seinfeld made like the syndication of that show they made like you know life changing
never have to work again ever and their kids don't have to work you know then grandkids never
like ever right that so that what syndication was is like right so it aired on NBC and then like
TBS bought the rights so now the TBS aired the reruns and and then you know you'd sell it overseas
and it was ever renegotiated this big money right but like is Jason Alexander and like the other
cast participating as much not all the syndication well because Jerry and Larry as the creators of
the show tend to have the biggest chunk of that participation um uh you know Jason Alexander and
they made a lot of money and they were making like a million dollars an episode toward the end
but I don't know if their tail was as big but now that is all changing right because there is no
sin you know there's no like no one watches no one watches reruns right like you go on if you want to
it's not like you're just like oh I'm putting the channels all right so Seinfeld's on TBS I'm gonna
watch it right that doesn't exist anymore right you go on net it's either it airs of course like
you can decide it's amazing right but again most people if you're watching Seinfeld you're watching
it on Netflix or whatever you know whatever it is and so that now it's just different right there
isn't the same big like tail where you're gonna make like you know a lot of money down the road
forever and ever um it is much more of like an immediate like you're gonna get paid you may get
like one payout but you're not but there isn't the it's like it's like movies right movies used to
have a movie could get profitable because it would the DVD sales would could help it like you know
big Lebowski I'm sure like you know a lot of this audience is a fan of Lebowski right like that was
not a hit in the theaters but like block that was probably the day the blockbuster right like
it's like a movie studio could basically if it didn't work hope that it becomes it's like a second
chance for it to be a hit right on Fight Club was like that Fight Club did not do incredibly well
when it came out but then it became like you know everyone's seen Fight Club and everyone's seen
big Lebowski and it's because of home video it had a wide had big names in it though that
it's weird because their theaters are just like this going down now in general the second life
both it's it's the same right that second life doesn't exist in the same way right there's
because people don't buy DVDs anymore they just it goes on streaming and whoever you know it's not
like they get paid you know once you make a deal right you basically make the movie
and it goes on on the streaming thing and now more and more it's the same thing right so you
make a movie for Universal it's going to go on Peacock right you make a movie for Netflix it's
just on Netflix so and same thing with television right it's like if you make a show for Netflix
there is no second it's just on Netflix forever like so so it's not that the industry has changed
in such a way that it's not the like you know you hear about the guys who like create you know
it's it's CSI it's like they're CSI or crazy you know they're making money yeah forever has CSI
I mean it's like CSI New York CSI Miami CSI LA CSI like special victim it's like
who's the creator behind it uh CSI was created by Andy Zeichner Jerry Bruckheimer was a producer on
and he was involved in it it was um so he's like guys I got another great idea it's CSI New Orleans
yeah and they're like fuck yeah we'll pick that up here's the money I mean yeah that's that he was
minting money that's and they're all still like are they all still going on like uh are there new
CSI's still cranking out every year there are there are I mean there that was around 25 years ago
I know they just redid the original CSI like they just revived it so it's all it's all like
like Mariska Hargitay and uh who's Elliot yeah yeah they're both like 60 years old so I like I
like look at like the the previews or whatever yeah he has his own show and she has like and
they have SVU so it's yeah those things that's his own thing I I haven't really done that much
in that space but it's a it's a good business if you can find find a winner I'm looking at uh
it's looking at the can you see the YouTube comments by the way no no that's probably for
the good okay there there yeah well no not not not today but a lot of times yes okay there were
the comments about uh the stereotypes of of Colombian people uh but other than that
not too bad no I I again I reiterate this like I it was the best experience I've ever had shooting
like they were fucking awesome and I and I hope that you know that was definitely the goal was to
not you know to hopefully not create you know not go into the stereotypes and not treat it as like
an American way into it and just like an American no and that was my point like I feel like if for
Italians Tony Soprano is like the yeah the the example I was like what club like the treatment
of the Colombian people was was uh much more nuanced and and uh tame than the like yeah any
boom bots like right like 100 that was the hope anyway right so I mean even it wasn't like even
just the the the humanization of pot like he's a more nuanced character right then like I mean
yeah I know the guy and the guy who played him really just became him it was pretty it was pretty
amazing to watch yeah I wanna I I actually I reached out to him and he I got I was like I'm
not expecting a response it's like we're doing this narcos thing do you want to like if you have
like an hour you want to shoot the shit uh that's funny yeah he's he's but but but I watched a video
of him uh in kind of like an actor's roundtable conversation with like a bunch of other amazing
actors he's just just talking about and I was like oh my god he speaks English really well
he's he's amazing he's the best truly the best what uh is there something
Brazilian that he's been in that you recommend yeah elite squad elite it was the guy who directed
the first uh trips of narcos um uh directed this movie elite squad it's awesome
uh I just had a question I totally forgot it but it was going to be an amazing question
you'll send me after I have no idea but uh no it was something related to
I don't remember you've just been sitting there I'm I'm super high right now
all right but all right do we have any any more peanut gallery questions
I think they're more heckling me right now nice
yeah no I I totally agree with that it it it is you know it's not a story about uh
modern day oh just yeah yeah it's it's interesting I hope that there's another
break it you know there's another breakout show that you know because it's it's now you
know well actually in conto by the way there we go Columbia which has become a huge head
wait sorry what is it in conto the Disney your kids haven't been obsessing over it
