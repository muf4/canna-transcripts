[00:00.000 --> 00:01.000]  No, no, no.
[00:01.000 --> 00:04.000]  His first underhooks just give you an underhook.
[00:04.000 --> 00:05.680]  Alright, so we are live.
[00:05.680 --> 00:08.400]  These guys are the triplets, right?
[00:08.400 --> 00:14.840]  You guys all say, same mother, different father, right?
[00:14.840 --> 00:16.520]  But welcome everyone.
[00:16.520 --> 00:18.600]  James Loud is back.
[00:18.600 --> 00:24.040]  I was telling people, I think, the other day, it's kind of like how Stephen Colbert or John
[00:24.040 --> 00:27.300]  Oliver goes on summer break and then comes back in the fall.
[00:27.300 --> 00:29.800]  So that's where we are right now.
[00:29.800 --> 00:33.780]  James has said basically they're just going to smoke weed and shoot the shit.
[00:33.780 --> 00:38.020]  So I'm smoking some, this is from Family Tree Seeds.
[00:38.020 --> 00:44.500]  This is some PAM 15 crossed with Testarossa and Black Lime Reserve.
[00:44.500 --> 00:48.900]  And I'm going to throw it on to you guys to get it going.
[00:48.900 --> 00:54.180]  So snuggle, snuggle and leave some room for the Holy Ghost.
[00:54.180 --> 00:55.180]  Fantastic.
[00:55.180 --> 00:57.020]  How's it going, everybody?
[00:57.020 --> 00:58.460]  Welcome to episode 31.
[00:59.120 --> 01:01.720]  My good friends, Marlon Asher and Joe Ramahi here.
[01:01.720 --> 01:06.340]  We were supposed to be working out of the studio, but the studio is not quite ready.
[01:06.340 --> 01:11.840]  So hopefully by next week, we'll have some live footage from the studio and we'll be
[01:11.840 --> 01:12.840]  able to do it that way.
[01:12.840 --> 01:15.040]  But we're getting in tight quarters here.
[01:15.040 --> 01:16.960]  We're going to smoke a bunch of weed today.
[01:16.960 --> 01:18.360]  And yeah, I'm glad to be back.
[01:18.360 --> 01:20.320]  I hope you guys are doing well.
[01:20.320 --> 01:23.480]  Let me open the chat here.
[01:23.480 --> 01:24.480]  So yeah.
[01:24.480 --> 01:25.480]  Group hug.
[01:25.500 --> 01:28.500]  We learned it the right way.
[01:28.500 --> 01:34.660]  I hope you guys got your herbs on because we're going to be smoking a little bit of
[01:34.660 --> 01:35.660]  weed today.
[01:35.660 --> 01:36.660]  Yeah.
[01:36.660 --> 01:37.660]  So yeah.
[01:37.660 --> 01:38.660]  And thanks for coming on the show, guys.
[01:38.660 --> 01:40.340]  I mean, I really appreciate it.
[01:40.340 --> 01:41.340]  Always a pleasure.
[01:41.340 --> 01:45.620]  So the last couple of months, I've, so it's been probably about six weeks since the last
[01:45.620 --> 01:46.620]  show.
[01:46.620 --> 01:48.180]  Joe was actually on the last show.
[01:48.180 --> 01:51.300]  Oh, when I called in from a, yeah.
[01:51.300 --> 01:52.300]  So Joe was on the show.
[01:52.300 --> 01:53.980]  Marlon's been on the show several times.
[01:53.980 --> 01:55.880]  We're doing a bunch of projects together.
[01:55.880 --> 02:01.280]  I've been working in Seattle doing some seed production with some friends up there.
[02:01.280 --> 02:03.600]  And Marlon came up and visited.
[02:03.600 --> 02:07.720]  We went to Kano Organics and we went to House of Cultivar.
[02:07.720 --> 02:09.320]  We saw some amazing herb.
[02:09.320 --> 02:10.320]  Yeah.
[02:10.320 --> 02:11.320]  House of Cultivar.
[02:11.320 --> 02:12.320]  Growing some fire.
[02:12.320 --> 02:13.320]  Some fire.
[02:13.320 --> 02:14.320]  Some Kano Organics.
[02:14.320 --> 02:19.740]  I mean, it's funny because I feel like those brands are shitting, both those guys are shitting
[02:19.740 --> 02:23.480]  on the California rec scene.
[02:23.980 --> 02:25.660]  There are good producers in California.
[02:25.660 --> 02:28.180]  There are a handful of them, but most of the stuff is boo-boo.
[02:28.180 --> 02:30.740]  It's not the stuff I enjoy smoking.
[02:30.740 --> 02:34.700]  You can take anything from Kano Organics or House of Cultivar and smoke it and it's going
[02:34.700 --> 02:35.700]  to be amazing.
[02:35.700 --> 02:36.700]  It's going to be fire.
[02:36.700 --> 02:37.700]  Amazing is an understatement.
[02:37.700 --> 02:38.700]  Fire.
[02:38.700 --> 02:39.700]  Yeah.
[02:39.700 --> 02:44.260]  I have friends that would disagree with you in California, but it's fine.
[02:44.260 --> 02:45.260]  It's fine?
[02:45.260 --> 02:46.260]  It's fine.
[02:46.260 --> 02:47.260]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:47.260 --> 02:50.500]  I mean, there is some good stuff in California, but I think as a whole-
[02:50.500 --> 02:51.500]  Yes, I agree.
[02:51.500 --> 02:52.500]  That middle 50th percentile.
[02:52.520 --> 02:53.520]  Right.
[02:53.520 --> 02:58.800]  The Washington cannabis scene is definitely ... I mean, obviously they went through rec
[02:58.800 --> 02:59.800]  earlier.
[02:59.800 --> 03:00.800]  They've kind of stabilized.
[03:00.800 --> 03:04.840]  I've had a lot of awesome trips to Seattle.
[03:04.840 --> 03:07.200]  What's the big ... What was the place there with crazy deals?
[03:07.200 --> 03:12.920]  Is it called ... Ike's is a sandwich thing in the Bay Area, but isn't Ike's like a dispensary,
[03:12.920 --> 03:15.520]  a big dispensary in Seattle?
[03:15.520 --> 03:16.520]  I haven't been to Ike's.
[03:16.520 --> 03:17.520]  It's a guy's name.
[03:17.520 --> 03:19.440]  Yeah, I'm not much for going to dispensaries.
[03:19.440 --> 03:21.920]  I've gone to a handful.
[03:21.940 --> 03:23.140]  They got the bakery up there.
[03:23.140 --> 03:25.860]  I think the bakery's got some interesting stuff.
[03:25.860 --> 03:31.620]  I feel like they're pushing fire and people aren't as concerned with that THC number,
[03:31.620 --> 03:32.620]  and that's huge.
[03:32.620 --> 03:33.620]  Yeah, that's huge.
[03:33.620 --> 03:39.420]  If they're buying quality, it doesn't have to be 31% THC, where in California it really
[03:39.420 --> 03:40.420]  does.
[03:40.420 --> 03:41.420]  Yeah.
[03:41.420 --> 03:45.580]  Then, I've been learning more stuff every day.
[03:45.580 --> 03:48.540]  It seems like I'm learning something new.
[03:48.540 --> 03:55.920]  Even California has come down to who can have the best certs and the best genetics
[03:55.920 --> 03:56.920]  in their strain.
[03:56.920 --> 04:05.120]  California has gone to a place where if you're not hitting, you're not making.
[04:05.120 --> 04:06.120]  For sure.
[04:06.120 --> 04:07.120]  Yeah, it's interesting.
[04:07.120 --> 04:12.320]  Then, with seeds, Marlon and I, we got the God's Your Farmer Seed Company.
[04:12.320 --> 04:16.520]  We released stuff on Dagadot Love and Seeds Here Now.
[04:16.520 --> 04:21.020]  I've been getting people asking me why we sell seeds for so cheap.
[04:21.020 --> 04:23.260]  I think we're trying to get seeds to everybody.
[04:23.260 --> 04:27.140]  We're not trying to be elite in the sense that we charge more.
[04:27.140 --> 04:30.080]  We're trying to be elite in the sense that we have the best genetics.
[04:30.080 --> 04:34.140]  I feel like the stuff that we've produced and the stuff we've collaborated on is the
[04:34.140 --> 04:35.140]  best of the best.
[04:35.140 --> 04:36.140]  Yeah.
[04:36.140 --> 04:41.100]  Definitely, we want people to grow the best genetics because we don't want everybody to
[04:41.100 --> 04:46.160]  have shitty weed and then a market for shitty weed arrives.
[04:46.160 --> 04:54.280]  Yeah, we're in a day and time where you have to ... As far as ... It's like the time where
[04:54.280 --> 04:58.400]  you could make money selling myds is going to go away, I think.
[04:58.400 --> 05:01.560]  Maybe not on the rec market because there's going to be so many new people coming in,
[05:01.560 --> 05:03.440]  but everything else.
[05:03.440 --> 05:07.440]  Even for personal growers, I feel like if you start with good genetics, you're going
[05:07.440 --> 05:08.440]  to get a good product.
[05:08.940 --> 05:13.700]  Then Joe and I here, just to give you guys a heads up with my book, I think there's been
[05:13.700 --> 05:16.220]  a million people asking, when's the book coming out?
[05:16.220 --> 05:17.220]  When's the book coming out?
[05:17.220 --> 05:19.980]  We are rewriting the book as we speak.
[05:19.980 --> 05:21.500]  We're doing major edits.
[05:21.500 --> 05:24.260]  We're doing major, major, major edits.
[05:24.260 --> 05:30.660]  Joe has a PhD and I feel like he's going to contribute a lot to the science side and the
[05:30.660 --> 05:33.540]  legitimacy of the book.
[05:33.540 --> 05:34.540]  That's where we're at with the book.
[05:34.540 --> 05:35.540]  Yeah.
[05:35.640 --> 05:37.320]  It's been fun working on it.
[05:37.320 --> 05:41.440]  I know I'm learning a ton and I'm trying to contribute what I can to it.
[05:41.440 --> 05:42.440]  Yeah.
[05:42.440 --> 05:43.440]  Yeah.
[05:43.440 --> 05:44.440]  Yeah.
[05:44.440 --> 05:45.440]  Yeah.
[05:45.440 --> 05:46.440]  Yeah.
[05:46.440 --> 05:49.080]  What have you been doing all summer?
[05:49.080 --> 05:50.080]  I've moved up.
[05:50.080 --> 05:53.760]  I've moved to the Bay Area from SoCal.
[05:53.760 --> 06:00.680]  I had a project down in San Diego that I ended and moved up here to the Bay.
[06:00.680 --> 06:04.640]  Between you and Apical Biotech in Sacramento ...
[06:04.740 --> 06:05.740]  The ASHRAE.
[06:05.740 --> 06:06.740]  Oh, the ASHRAE.
[06:06.740 --> 06:07.740]  Yeah.
[06:07.740 --> 06:08.740]  I'm busy.
[06:08.740 --> 06:09.740]  Getting back to jujitsu up here.
[06:09.740 --> 06:15.420]  Holler at all the Bay Area jujitsu schools, all the Ralph Gracie guys that have beat me
[06:15.420 --> 06:16.900]  up in the last two years.
[06:16.900 --> 06:17.900]  I'm back up in the Bay.
[06:17.900 --> 06:18.900]  Yeah.
[06:18.900 --> 06:24.900]  It's going to be fun to get you and Guy again and to roll with you.
[06:24.900 --> 06:25.900]  Yeah.
[06:25.900 --> 06:26.900]  I've been training jujitsu.
[06:26.900 --> 06:28.780]  I'm back in my second week.
[06:28.780 --> 06:30.020]  I've been working out for a year.
[06:30.020 --> 06:31.020]  I mean, I'm bigger.
[06:31.020 --> 06:32.860]  COVID's been hard on all of us.
[06:32.880 --> 06:36.160]  I feel like COVID was one of my best years for myself.
[06:36.160 --> 06:38.160]  I got fat out of shape during COVID.
[06:38.160 --> 06:39.160]  Yeah.
[06:39.160 --> 06:40.160]  I had less exercise before COVID.
[06:40.160 --> 06:47.560]  That was kind of wrong of me, but I'm kind of back on sports, playing with basketball,
[06:47.560 --> 06:49.560]  running around a little track, you know?
[06:49.560 --> 06:50.560]  Yeah.
[06:50.560 --> 06:53.720]  Trying to keep myself fit because it's necessary in this time to be fit.
[06:53.720 --> 06:56.560]  And Marlon has a one-year-old, so he's chasing his dream.
[06:56.560 --> 06:57.560]  Yeah.
[06:57.560 --> 06:58.560]  I just moved too.
[06:58.860 --> 07:03.860]  I just moved from Grass Valley to Monterey.
[07:03.860 --> 07:04.860]  Yeah.
[07:04.860 --> 07:06.860]  The fires there were crazy.
[07:06.860 --> 07:08.860]  Burnt out everything on our street.
[07:08.860 --> 07:14.860]  And my condolences to all the people that lose their home and their valuables.
[07:14.860 --> 07:20.860]  And you know what I have to say about that is God give you life that you can rebuild.
[07:20.860 --> 07:24.860]  So think about the positive and not that you lost everything.
[07:25.160 --> 07:29.160]  Yeah, may God guide you from strength to strength every time.
[07:29.160 --> 07:31.160]  It's great.
[07:31.160 --> 07:33.160]  Yeah, the fires this year are crazy again.
[07:33.160 --> 07:34.160]  Yeah, yeah.
[07:34.160 --> 07:35.160]  It was crazy.
[07:35.160 --> 07:38.160]  I think it started from some campground.
[07:38.160 --> 07:39.160]  It's really sad.
[07:39.160 --> 07:40.160]  Yeah.
[07:40.160 --> 07:43.160]  So a lot of people was burnt out, you know?
[07:43.160 --> 07:44.160]  Yeah.
[07:44.160 --> 07:45.160]  So we've lost a legend.
[07:45.160 --> 07:47.160]  We'll touch on Frenchie real quick.
[07:47.160 --> 07:52.160]  You know, it's really sad, the passing of Frenchie a couple weeks ago.
[07:52.460 --> 07:58.460]  I think in many ways he was a pioneer that wanted to share his experience with everybody
[07:58.460 --> 08:01.460]  and teach everybody and pass on the knowledge.
[08:01.460 --> 08:03.460]  And it wasn't about money.
[08:03.460 --> 08:09.460]  I think we live in this world where everything, not everything, but a vast majority of the stuff people want to monetize.
[08:09.460 --> 08:11.460]  And it wasn't about money for Frenchie.
[08:11.460 --> 08:16.460]  It was about sharing the knowledge and, you know, improving stuff.
[08:16.460 --> 08:18.460]  And Frenchie was an amazing guy, man.
[08:18.460 --> 08:21.460]  And it's really sad he's gone.
[08:21.760 --> 08:24.760]  I didn't think the last time I talked to Frenchie was going to be the last time I talked to him.
[08:24.760 --> 08:26.760]  I had no idea.
[08:26.760 --> 08:30.760]  You know, in my opinion, he's a true legend.
[08:30.760 --> 08:33.760]  You know, it's rare that we get people like that.
[08:33.760 --> 08:41.760]  There's only a handful of people I would consider legends in the industry that have really put their time in over the years.
[08:41.760 --> 08:48.760]  You know, we're talking 40 years of experience with cannabis and a true, true person.
[08:48.760 --> 08:49.760]  Yeah, he's a true person.
[08:49.760 --> 08:50.760]  Passion for the sacred plant.
[08:51.060 --> 08:58.060]  He embodied all of that very much like Franco from Greenhouse and a handful of other people.
[08:58.060 --> 09:01.060]  So, yeah, rest in peace, buddy.
[09:01.060 --> 09:05.060]  And, you know, thank you for your contributions.
[09:05.060 --> 09:06.060]  It was a big loss.
[09:06.060 --> 09:08.060]  It was a big loss.
[09:08.060 --> 09:11.060]  Some people were downplaying it and stuff like that.
[09:11.060 --> 09:12.060]  It's ridiculous.
[09:12.060 --> 09:14.060]  It's like Frenchie, he had a huge heart.
[09:14.060 --> 09:17.060]  So, yeah.
[09:17.060 --> 09:20.060]  So, I guess let's talk about Hoplite and Viroid.
[09:20.360 --> 09:26.360]  Because I think that's something, you know, the science side, there's a lot of misinformation still.
[09:26.360 --> 09:28.360]  What's the latest stuff over the summer?
[09:28.360 --> 09:30.360]  People said that they could cure it with dips.
[09:30.360 --> 09:34.360]  People said that you could cure Hoplite and Viroid with dips.
[09:34.360 --> 09:35.360]  That's not true.
[09:35.360 --> 09:38.360]  People said that you could cure it with nutrition.
[09:38.360 --> 09:40.360]  That's not true.
[09:40.660 --> 09:51.660]  And just still over the summer as kind of I have projects in other states through Apical Biotech and with you.
[09:51.660 --> 09:52.660]  I just meet more and more.
[09:52.660 --> 10:01.660]  And as my Instagram continues to grow and I meet more and more people, all the time I'm interacting with people that are like, why do I not know about this?
[10:01.660 --> 10:03.660]  And I'm like, I don't know why you don't know about this.
[10:03.660 --> 10:05.660]  But it's cool.
[10:05.660 --> 10:07.660]  Everyone learns stuff at different rates.
[10:07.960 --> 10:20.960]  And as things kind of roll out, you know, people in Oklahoma, Maine, Michigan, and now New York, it's like people are moving into legal or people are scaling larger and larger operations.
[10:20.960 --> 10:22.960]  And they're noticing things.
[10:22.960 --> 10:24.960]  And I'm like, okay, there's this viral disease.
[10:24.960 --> 10:26.960]  It's not really a virus.
[10:26.960 --> 10:28.960]  But for all intents and purposes it is.
[10:28.960 --> 10:30.960]  And just things like tool sanitation.
[10:30.960 --> 10:35.960]  Again, so basically, yeah, Hoplite and Viroid, if you tuned in for the first time now.
[10:36.260 --> 10:40.260]  It's this viral, molecular, invisible disease that's spreading through the cannabis industry.
[10:40.260 --> 10:42.260]  It's a huge problem in hemp.
[10:42.260 --> 10:44.260]  It's a huge problem in the THC market.
[10:44.260 --> 10:48.260]  And it causes crop instability and crop loss.
[10:48.260 --> 10:56.260]  Dutted flower, like large operations will lose, I'm talking about 100 light place will lose half of their flower.
[10:56.260 --> 11:00.260]  You know, this is thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of dollars of crop loss.
[11:00.260 --> 11:04.260]  And ultimately growers, we're all just farmers here.
[11:04.560 --> 11:06.560]  So yeah, keep your tools clean.
[11:06.560 --> 11:08.560]  Don't share needles.
[11:08.560 --> 11:16.560]  And by that I mean that people are using the same cutters in their whole operation still.
[11:16.560 --> 11:18.560]  And it hurts, but it's fine.
[11:18.560 --> 11:20.560]  It's fine.
[11:20.560 --> 11:22.560]  People learn things.
[11:22.560 --> 11:24.560]  There's more at risk.
[11:24.560 --> 11:26.560]  You have more plants.
[11:26.560 --> 11:28.560]  There's always going to be more at risk.
[11:28.560 --> 11:30.560]  So I just am out there educating people.
[11:30.560 --> 11:32.560]  Touch basing on what you said on Frenchie.
[11:32.860 --> 11:36.860]  I was talking to a guy I used to talk at in, was this Indo Expo or Cannabis Science Conference?
[11:36.860 --> 11:38.860]  That's what it is.
[11:38.860 --> 11:40.860]  It was Cannabis Science Conference.
[11:40.860 --> 11:42.860]  And he was just talking about, and I was like, hey dude, just wanted to say hi.
[11:42.860 --> 11:46.860]  And he was just like a very sincere, always was like he's passing on this information.
[11:46.860 --> 11:50.860]  And it reminded me of something I heard on like Steve-O's podcast a week ago.
[11:50.860 --> 11:54.860]  And they're like, first third of your life you fuck up and are just learning.
[11:54.860 --> 11:56.860]  The second third of your life you're actually building things.
[11:56.860 --> 12:00.860]  And the final third of your life you're giving back from all the things that you've taken.
[12:01.160 --> 12:03.160]  And you're like Frenchie is someone that lived that kind of shit.
[12:03.160 --> 12:13.160]  And I'm like that's, you see less, as people come up, I've only been in this industry for my six, seven, Jesus years.
[12:13.160 --> 12:21.160]  And I'm like, I see too many people I'm meeting are just like, they're in it just to take stuff out.
[12:21.160 --> 12:25.160]  Instead of like give back and build back from the communities that they're working with.
[12:25.160 --> 12:29.160]  So yeah, so that's why Frenchie will be missed for that.
[12:29.460 --> 12:31.460]  For those kinds of important ass reasons.
[12:31.460 --> 12:33.460]  Oh, you know what I have is I have some temple ball right here.
[12:33.460 --> 12:35.460]  Oh Jesus. We're going into extracts already?
[12:35.460 --> 12:41.460]  Yeah, we're going to, well, so we got some bomb ass hash.
[12:41.460 --> 12:42.460]  Oh yeah.
[12:42.460 --> 12:46.460]  So this hash that you see right here, we're going to smoke this in Frenchie's honor.
[12:46.460 --> 12:48.460]  Marlon's going to roll that into a nice little lip.
[12:48.460 --> 12:50.460]  Oh, is that his?
[12:50.460 --> 12:52.460]  This is not his. I don't have, every time I get his, I smoke it.
[12:52.460 --> 12:54.460]  It doesn't last.
[12:54.460 --> 12:58.460]  So it does, it doesn't last. It's not one of those things, but yeah, I got this from up north.
[12:58.760 --> 13:00.760]  It's really, really good by the way. And it's sour diesel.
[13:02.760 --> 13:06.760]  My white buffalo, which is hilarious because there's a strain called white buffalo.
[13:06.760 --> 13:10.760]  Totally. Well, so, and then, you know, if we start talking about hoplite and again, where are these,
[13:10.760 --> 13:14.760]  you know, we can kind of talk about kind of where like these ideas originated, where you can outgrow it.
[13:14.760 --> 13:18.760]  Right? Because with certain things you can outgrow powdery mildew.
[13:18.760 --> 13:20.760]  You can outgrow a lot of things.
[13:21.060 --> 13:27.060]  And I've worked with growers that are systemically infected, yet they maintain,
[13:27.060 --> 13:31.060]  like really they don't seem to have a lot of problems because overall plant health is great.
[13:33.060 --> 13:37.060]  It's just this thing that kind of like, if you have other problems, it makes them,
[13:37.060 --> 13:39.060]  it then becomes a major problem.
[13:39.060 --> 13:43.060]  But if you have an overall healthy grow, people try to deal with it.
[13:43.060 --> 13:48.060]  And that's, what's kind of really scary is that as I work with more and more groups,
[13:48.360 --> 13:54.360]  it's always this argument between the financial arguments versus the plant health arguments.
[13:54.360 --> 14:00.360]  And it's kind of interesting to watch these things play out as people try to calculate loss,
[14:00.360 --> 14:02.360]  try to calculate what's tolerable.
[14:04.360 --> 14:10.360]  And I have like hard lines that I argue with money people for years now.
[14:10.360 --> 14:14.360]  And it's interesting just seeing how these things kind of play out in different states at different scales.
[14:14.660 --> 14:20.660]  And when we have people working with kind of like established clean lines,
[14:20.660 --> 14:24.660]  where it's at least been tested for some things,
[14:26.660 --> 14:30.660]  then you see people scale with less problems.
[14:30.660 --> 14:32.660]  Everyone has problems.
[14:32.660 --> 14:36.660]  I don't think I've known of a single large scale grow that hasn't had some kind of problem.
[14:36.660 --> 14:38.660]  No, you're going to get problems, but that's why you have things like IPM.
[14:40.660 --> 14:42.660]  Part of tissue culture is outgrowing stuff, right?
[14:42.960 --> 14:44.960]  So like that's the whole concept.
[14:44.960 --> 14:46.960]  Keeping a clean stock to go back to if you need it.
[14:48.960 --> 14:54.960]  And honestly, I love the fact that now I have several hundred strains in a very small footprint in Sacramento growing a ton.
[14:56.960 --> 14:58.960]  It's pretty awesome. And I mean, we're talking about elite shit too.
[14:58.960 --> 14:59.960]  It's not just like...
[14:59.960 --> 15:00.960]  It's insane.
[15:00.960 --> 15:01.960]  It's insane.
[15:01.960 --> 15:07.960]  It's the first time I've ever really sat down and gone through every single strain now that I've moved up here
[15:07.960 --> 15:09.960]  and I'm indexing them all one by one.
[15:09.960 --> 15:10.960]  Insane.
[15:10.960 --> 15:11.960]  Yeah, it's insane.
[15:12.960 --> 15:13.960]  I'm very happy about what I have.
[15:13.960 --> 15:15.960]  I'm very lucky to work with the people that I work with.
[15:17.960 --> 15:22.960]  I just visited a medium to large grow outdoor.
[15:24.960 --> 15:29.960]  And they were growing the ice cream cake and it was looking really beautiful.
[15:29.960 --> 15:34.960]  But there's always some problem with growing meat outdoor when you're up in the mountains.
[15:36.960 --> 15:38.960]  Yeah, and ice cream cake...
[15:38.960 --> 15:40.960]  I personally like ice cream cake.
[15:41.260 --> 15:42.260]  We can talk about that for a second.
[15:42.260 --> 15:43.260]  It grows nice.
[15:43.260 --> 15:47.260]  It grows nice, but everybody fucking decided to grow it like fucking Blue Dream back in the day.
[15:47.260 --> 15:49.260]  It's spread like wildfire.
[15:51.260 --> 15:54.260]  The guys went from wedding cake to ice cream cake really quickly.
[15:54.260 --> 15:58.260]  And so now I think everywhere is flooded with this awesome ice cream cake.
[15:58.260 --> 16:00.260]  It makes amazing extract.
[16:01.260 --> 16:04.260]  It's a heck of a lot better than things like Purple Punch.
[16:04.260 --> 16:06.260]  Hey, I love all of those things.
[16:06.260 --> 16:08.260]  I am not a fan of Purple Punch.
[16:08.260 --> 16:10.260]  We can agree on that, guys.
[16:10.560 --> 16:11.560]  Blue Dream...
[16:11.560 --> 16:15.560]  I'm not a fan of Blue Dream because it makes me paranoid.
[16:17.560 --> 16:19.560]  I've never been a fan of Blue Dream.
[16:19.560 --> 16:24.560]  Now the ice cream cake is kind of, you know, a little similar.
[16:24.560 --> 16:26.560]  I never got the paranoia.
[16:27.560 --> 16:29.560]  It was one of those things where I had to smoke it when I was going out.
[16:29.560 --> 16:34.560]  I think Blue Dream is a great cultivar for structure.
[16:35.560 --> 16:37.560]  It has unique chirps.
[16:37.560 --> 16:39.560]  It has a very unique structure.
[16:39.860 --> 16:41.860]  It's at the top when it comes to structure.
[16:41.860 --> 16:44.860]  There's nothing that grows better than Blue Dream.
[16:44.860 --> 16:45.860]  Blue Dream is...
[16:45.860 --> 16:47.860]  Indoor or outdoor? Outdoor or indoor?
[16:47.860 --> 16:50.860]  I would say it grows great indoor and outdoor.
[16:50.860 --> 16:51.860]  It grows great outdoor.
[16:51.860 --> 16:52.860]  It's great outdoor.
[16:52.860 --> 16:53.860]  It's great outdoor.
[16:53.860 --> 16:55.860]  But I mean, indoor, you can...
[16:55.860 --> 16:58.860]  Even back in the day when you were getting 2.2 pounds per light, which is nothing now.
[16:59.860 --> 17:05.860]  You know, guys like Ramsey out there are getting 5.7 pounds per 1000 watt bulb.
[17:05.860 --> 17:06.860]  Holler at Ramsey.
[17:06.860 --> 17:07.860]  Per light.
[17:08.160 --> 17:12.160]  Blue Dream growers are the crossfit people of cannabis growers apparently.
[17:12.160 --> 17:14.160]  They all just love it in a very special way.
[17:14.160 --> 17:15.160]  Respect. It's all good.
[17:15.160 --> 17:16.160]  Yeah, I mean, I'm more...
[17:16.160 --> 17:19.160]  So when it comes to Blue Dream, I'm not a Blue Dream smoker.
[17:19.160 --> 17:20.160]  I mean, I can appreciate the plant.
[17:21.160 --> 17:25.160]  I would rather smoke a lot of the modern stuff we're talking about.
[17:25.160 --> 17:27.160]  You know, I like OG Kush.
[17:27.160 --> 17:28.160]  I like gas.
[17:28.160 --> 17:29.160]  That's definitely...
[17:29.160 --> 17:30.160]  You know, compounds.
[17:30.160 --> 17:32.160]  He's doing some awesome stuff right now.
[17:32.160 --> 17:33.160]  Big shout out to Chris.
[17:34.160 --> 17:37.160]  Chris is really crushing on some of the genetics he's releasing.
[17:37.460 --> 17:38.460]  That pave is amazing.
[17:38.460 --> 17:39.460]  The pave is amazing.
[17:39.460 --> 17:40.460]  I've seen the jokers.
[17:40.460 --> 17:41.460]  I just...
[17:41.460 --> 17:42.460]  I got some jokers right here.
[17:42.460 --> 17:43.460]  You guys want to check out some jokers?
[17:43.460 --> 17:44.460]  Shit.
[17:44.460 --> 17:45.460]  See?
[17:46.460 --> 17:48.460]  Chris has got me in the trip intro.
[17:48.460 --> 17:50.460]  I've got him for the silence.
[17:50.460 --> 17:51.460]  I wish I had like...
[17:51.460 --> 17:56.460]  Yeah, I mean, we had him on and we kind of talked about the way he checks all the boxes.
[17:56.460 --> 18:00.460]  But if you guys can see this nug, that's from Chris.
[18:02.460 --> 18:05.460]  It doesn't do it justice because it's so dark, but this thing is like friggin...
[18:05.760 --> 18:06.760]  It's a laptop camera.
[18:06.760 --> 18:07.760]  I know.
[18:07.760 --> 18:08.760]  We need like a...
[18:08.760 --> 18:09.760]  We need a real camera.
[18:09.760 --> 18:12.760]  Yeah, you need like a Harry Mack Omegle wraps setup.
[18:12.760 --> 18:13.760]  Already?
[18:13.760 --> 18:14.760]  Yeah.
[18:14.760 --> 18:15.760]  Yeah, I mean...
[18:15.760 --> 18:16.760]  I'm just stretching out hands.
[18:16.760 --> 18:18.760]  I'm excited about a lot of compound stuff.
[18:18.760 --> 18:22.760]  There's a bunch of guys that are doing some amazing work, but I really, really...
[18:22.760 --> 18:28.760]  James, just quickly, we got some feedback on the Farmers TKO.
[18:28.760 --> 18:29.760]  Right on.
[18:30.760 --> 18:32.760]  Very impressed with the Farmers TKO.
[18:32.760 --> 18:33.760]  It's looking amazing.
[18:33.760 --> 18:34.760]  I'm glad you enjoy it.
[18:35.060 --> 18:40.060]  Man, that was one of our favorite when we were putting the strings together.
[18:40.060 --> 18:42.060]  We need more zoomed in flower shots.
[18:42.060 --> 18:43.060]  Yeah.
[18:43.060 --> 18:46.060]  So Marlon and I met over OG Kush.
[18:46.060 --> 18:49.060]  If there was no OG, we probably wouldn't be friends to this day.
[18:49.060 --> 18:51.060]  That's how powerful that strain is.
[18:51.060 --> 18:52.060]  It's like...
[18:54.060 --> 18:56.060]  It's real interesting because, yeah, we met in 2012.
[18:56.060 --> 19:01.060]  I'm going to do a little show in a couple of weeks with a couple of guys I met and...
[19:01.060 --> 19:02.060]  Oh, wow.
[19:02.060 --> 19:03.060]  This smells really fucking hash.
[19:03.060 --> 19:04.060]  Hashy, boy.
[19:04.360 --> 19:05.360]  Yeah, you just hit it.
[19:05.360 --> 19:06.360]  We're doing a show.
[19:06.360 --> 19:08.360]  Dude, you can really smell the hash in this thing.
[19:08.360 --> 19:09.360]  That's freaking great.
[19:09.360 --> 19:10.360]  It's nice.
[19:10.360 --> 19:12.360]  And I just put a little worm down in the juice.
[19:12.360 --> 19:14.360]  Yeah, you can taste it.
[19:14.360 --> 19:15.360]  Yeah, it's nice.
[19:15.360 --> 19:16.360]  That's why I said it's good hashy.
[19:16.360 --> 19:18.360]  A bunch of people I met at the Hemp Fest in 2012.
[19:18.360 --> 19:20.360]  I'm trying to get them all.
[19:20.360 --> 19:22.360]  It's going to be an interesting show.
[19:22.360 --> 19:31.360]  You can kind of hear some of the origin stories about me coming into the cannabis scene out of the shadows, I guess we can call it.
[19:31.660 --> 19:37.660]  I think for that one, we need to see how many people you can huddle around you in one episode.
[19:37.660 --> 19:39.660]  We can fit quite a few.
[19:39.660 --> 19:41.660]  Most of them are pretty small.
[19:41.660 --> 19:43.660]  Although, Master Bong, I don't know if you guys know Master Bong.
[19:43.660 --> 19:45.660]  He's got an Afro that goes like shoulder to shoulder.
[19:45.660 --> 19:49.660]  And so, he would have to be sitting in the back of him.
[19:49.660 --> 19:51.660]  So, I don't know if you guys have seen the zope yet.
[19:51.660 --> 19:53.660]  We got some zope here.
[19:53.660 --> 19:55.660]  I don't think we're going to be able to get good Zunis or something.
[19:55.660 --> 19:57.660]  But, yeah, we're going to be doing a lot of stuff.
[19:57.960 --> 19:59.960]  We got some zope here.
[19:59.960 --> 20:01.960]  I don't think we're going to be able to get good Zunis.
[20:01.960 --> 20:03.960]  There's small bugs left.
[20:03.960 --> 20:05.960]  I wanted to save some for the show.
[20:05.960 --> 20:07.960]  We'll probably smoke it, but this shit is fire.
[20:07.960 --> 20:09.960]  That is the zope.
[20:09.960 --> 20:11.960]  It is dark.
[20:11.960 --> 20:13.960]  It is no relation to the soap either.
[20:13.960 --> 20:15.960]  You can smell that.
[20:15.960 --> 20:17.960]  That's great.
[20:17.960 --> 20:19.960]  Totally good stuff.
[20:19.960 --> 20:21.960]  I've been smoking some really crazy.
[20:21.960 --> 20:23.960]  We've been smoking Pluto from Sticky Farms.
[20:23.960 --> 20:25.960]  I really like the Pluto.
[20:26.260 --> 20:30.260]  Marlon said on the show 6 months ago that he really didn't like the Pluto.
[20:30.260 --> 20:32.260]  He's allowed to change his mind.
[20:32.260 --> 20:34.260]  I'm always allowed to change my mind.
[20:34.260 --> 20:36.260]  That's because I was hooked on the GMO.
[20:36.260 --> 20:38.260]  You were hooked on GMO.
[20:38.260 --> 20:40.260]  I can't even remember.
[20:40.260 --> 20:42.260]  There's shoulder to shoulder.
[20:42.260 --> 20:44.260]  Yeah, I was hooked on GMO, guys.
[20:44.260 --> 20:46.260]  Nothing was coming close to that taste for me.
[20:46.260 --> 20:48.260]  But, then James gave me something.
[20:48.260 --> 20:50.260]  Alright, here.
[20:50.260 --> 20:52.260]  I have an existential question, guys.
[20:52.560 --> 20:54.560]  I have an existential question, guys, about breeding and changing your mind about flavors.
[20:54.560 --> 20:56.560]  As a breeder, I was talking to another lovely PhD from UC Davis.
[20:56.560 --> 20:58.560]  It's a plant breeder.
[20:58.560 --> 21:00.560]  We were talking about are there these idealized...
[21:00.560 --> 21:02.560]  Do you think there's a holy grail of cannabis that can be bred and then maintained in perpetuity?
[21:02.560 --> 21:04.560]  Or would the industry itself demand...
[21:04.560 --> 21:06.560]  No.
[21:06.560 --> 21:08.560]  The hype machine behind it is the hype machine.
[21:08.560 --> 21:10.560]  It's the hype machine.
[21:10.560 --> 21:12.560]  It's the hype machine.
[21:12.560 --> 21:14.560]  It's the hype machine.
[21:14.560 --> 21:16.560]  It's the hype machine.
[21:16.560 --> 21:18.560]  It's the hype machine.
[21:18.560 --> 21:20.560]  It's the hype machine.
[21:20.860 --> 21:22.860]  I don't know.
[21:22.860 --> 21:24.860]  The hype machine behind things, the seasonality, weight.
[21:24.860 --> 21:26.860]  Look at what Chardonnay...
[21:26.860 --> 21:28.860]  Look at Pinot Noir and wine.
[21:28.860 --> 21:30.860]  Well, wine is so different.
[21:30.860 --> 21:32.860]  It's really hard to compare.
[21:32.860 --> 21:34.860]  It's a bad metaphor.
[21:34.860 --> 21:36.860]  It's like apples and bananas.
[21:36.860 --> 21:38.860]  Or apples and oranges.
[21:38.860 --> 21:40.860]  It's like trying to compare wine and weed.
[21:40.860 --> 21:42.860]  But, I think right now we are definitely on the hype train.
[21:42.860 --> 21:44.860]  I believe that'll change.
[21:44.860 --> 21:46.860]  But, I also think it's going to stabilize.
[21:46.860 --> 21:48.860]  Right now, stuff is popular for a couple months until the new something comes out.
[21:49.160 --> 21:51.160]  It's just a very slight variation.
[21:51.160 --> 21:53.160]  Say that to OG Kush smokers.
[21:53.160 --> 21:55.160]  No, but I'm telling you right now...
[21:55.160 --> 21:57.160]  You can't say that to OG Kush smokers.
[21:57.160 --> 21:59.160]  Right now, overall, with the gelato, we're talking...
[21:59.160 --> 22:01.160]  The good point. Gelato is a good point.
[22:01.160 --> 22:03.160]  Everything is a gelato derivative.
[22:03.160 --> 22:05.160]  We've got these derivatives of all these things that are popular.
[22:05.160 --> 22:07.160]  Every once in a while, you get a gem.
[22:07.160 --> 22:09.160]  You get this Zope.
[22:09.160 --> 22:11.160]  Big ups to friggin' Wizard Trees.
[22:11.160 --> 22:13.160]  Doja Pack.
[22:13.160 --> 22:15.160]  And, Dio Farms.
[22:15.160 --> 22:17.160]  I think that shit's fire.
[22:17.460 --> 22:19.460]  For the OG Kush smokers,
[22:19.460 --> 22:21.460]  I think if there is a new strain
[22:21.460 --> 22:23.460]  that any part of it that reminds them of smoking OG Kush,
[22:23.460 --> 22:25.460]  it'll be a hit with them.
[22:25.460 --> 22:27.460]  I believe that OG Kush is going to come back.
[22:27.460 --> 22:29.460]  Stronger than anything that resembles it.
[22:29.460 --> 22:31.460]  But, you know, the funny thing is
[22:31.460 --> 22:33.460]  I keep reading articles
[22:33.460 --> 22:35.460]  and they're friggin' misquoting
[22:35.460 --> 22:37.460]  what OG Kush is.
[22:37.460 --> 22:39.460]  They're like, pepper.
[22:39.460 --> 22:41.460]  It's got pepper in it.
[22:41.460 --> 22:43.460]  And, I'm like, no.
[22:43.460 --> 22:45.460]  It has pine and it has citrus.
[22:45.760 --> 22:47.760]  And, OG Kush is really gassy
[22:47.760 --> 22:49.760]  with pine and citrus.
[22:49.760 --> 22:51.760]  And, that's what makes it beautiful.
[22:51.760 --> 22:53.760]  If you can breed it into something
[22:53.760 --> 22:55.760]  and add lavender to it,
[22:55.760 --> 22:57.760]  you get, you know,
[22:57.760 --> 22:59.760]  it's like looking at cookies.
[22:59.760 --> 23:01.760]  It's basically, not like that anise.
[23:01.760 --> 23:03.760]  But, it captures everything
[23:03.760 --> 23:05.760]  that's great about OG Kush as well.
[23:05.760 --> 23:07.760]  I feel like it has that gas
[23:07.760 --> 23:09.760]  with that unique
[23:09.760 --> 23:11.760]  like cherry flavor.
[23:11.760 --> 23:13.760]  And, leather.
[23:14.060 --> 23:16.060]  I like leather in my weed.
[23:16.060 --> 23:18.060]  I don't know.
[23:18.060 --> 23:20.060]  There's just those things.
[23:20.060 --> 23:22.060]  It's interesting because let's talk about gas for a bit
[23:22.060 --> 23:24.060]  since we're on the topic of OG Kush.
[23:24.060 --> 23:26.060]  And, there's so many different
[23:26.060 --> 23:28.060]  when it comes to gas
[23:28.060 --> 23:30.060]  when we're talking about
[23:30.060 --> 23:32.060]  these are thials, right?
[23:32.060 --> 23:34.060]  So, gas, thial,
[23:34.060 --> 23:36.060]  there's a huge spectrum of it, right?
[23:36.060 --> 23:38.060]  So, now if we're talking about things like OG Kush
[23:38.060 --> 23:40.060]  there's all kinds of different gas
[23:40.060 --> 23:42.060]  with the chems and with the OG
[23:42.360 --> 23:44.360]  they go from here to here
[23:44.360 --> 23:46.360]  and there's things that fall in that category
[23:46.360 --> 23:48.360]  that I think most people don't even think of
[23:48.360 --> 23:50.360]  like burnt tire is one of my favorite descriptions for it.
[23:50.360 --> 23:52.360]  Latex glove.
[23:52.360 --> 23:54.360]  You get that latex, that rubbery latex kind of smell.
[23:54.360 --> 23:56.360]  And, you know,
[23:56.360 --> 23:58.360]  you can even get to that skunky side
[23:58.360 --> 24:00.360]  of it, which isn't really gas.
[24:00.360 --> 24:02.360]  That's skunk.
[24:02.360 --> 24:04.360]  I think skunk and gas are similar
[24:04.360 --> 24:06.360]  but they're not the same and they're both thials.
[24:06.360 --> 24:08.360]  Do you want to talk about thials?
[24:08.360 --> 24:10.360]  I'm too high to talk about thials
[24:10.660 --> 24:12.660]  but I am ready to talk about it.
[24:12.660 --> 24:14.660]  So, you know I'm deaf in the right ear.
[24:14.660 --> 24:16.660]  Most people know me that I'm deaf in the right ear.
[24:16.660 --> 24:18.660]  So, I experience music differently than you, bro.
[24:18.660 --> 24:20.660]  We taught you as chefs
[24:20.660 --> 24:22.660]  we talk about people taste different, right?
[24:22.660 --> 24:24.660]  So,
[24:24.660 --> 24:26.660]  what I think
[24:26.660 --> 24:28.660]  one of my, someone just said this
[24:28.660 --> 24:30.660]  I'm like, it's insane that
[24:30.660 --> 24:32.660]  everyone's experience is fundamentally different
[24:32.660 --> 24:34.660]  so there's no like idealized
[24:34.660 --> 24:36.660]  customer that you're shopping to.
[24:36.660 --> 24:38.660]  It's literally like music
[24:38.960 --> 24:40.960]  So, back to my
[24:40.960 --> 24:42.960]  thing that I was dragging the argument
[24:42.960 --> 24:44.960]  back to, you know, barbecued
[24:44.960 --> 24:46.960]  is the variety of cannabis, right?
[24:46.960 --> 24:48.960]  My friend Maxwell
[24:48.960 --> 24:50.960]  would say, he's like
[24:50.960 --> 24:52.960]  one of the things that he both loves and hates
[24:52.960 --> 24:54.960]  about, you know, working with hundreds of strains
[24:54.960 --> 24:56.960]  is that they're all so different, right?
[24:56.960 --> 24:58.960]  And
[24:58.960 --> 25:00.960]  very few other
[25:00.960 --> 25:02.960]  no other really cultivated
[25:02.960 --> 25:04.960]  agricultural crops are like this.
[25:04.960 --> 25:06.960]  You're never going to get,
[25:07.260 --> 25:09.260]  what of the 700 apples am I going to
[25:09.260 --> 25:11.260]  eat in my pie today, right?
[25:11.260 --> 25:13.260]  Unless you're in like, what is it, Kazakhstan
[25:13.260 --> 25:15.260]  or the ancestral home of apples.
[25:15.260 --> 25:17.260]  Sure.
[25:17.260 --> 25:19.260]  But you know, there's no claim this is diverse.
[25:19.260 --> 25:21.260]  That's for sure. Craft beer
[25:21.260 --> 25:23.260]  is a good comparison about like
[25:23.260 --> 25:25.260]  the THC chasing and how
[25:25.260 --> 25:27.260]  we dialed it back. I remember double daddy
[25:27.260 --> 25:29.260]  beer. Oh, they had triple IPAs
[25:29.260 --> 25:31.260]  that were just crushing people. And then it wasn't
[25:31.260 --> 25:33.260]  even a beer anymore because they'd spike it with
[25:33.260 --> 25:35.260]  alcohol.
[25:35.560 --> 25:37.560]  That's not a beer anymore.
[25:37.560 --> 25:39.560]  But yeah, triple IPAs, like
[25:39.560 --> 25:41.560]  what is that? What do those get up to? 14%
[25:41.560 --> 25:43.560]  of that beer anymore? That's wine,
[25:43.560 --> 25:45.560]  bro. That's a banana. But it
[25:45.560 --> 25:47.560]  tastes like beer. It'll fuck
[25:47.560 --> 25:49.560]  you up. But you know, we have some stuff
[25:49.560 --> 25:51.560]  and it's like, you know, we're still learning about
[25:51.560 --> 25:53.560]  cannabis. Every day people are learning new things.
[25:53.560 --> 25:55.560]  THC, you know, you can
[25:55.560 --> 25:57.560]  have stuff that's 39% but it doesn't
[25:57.560 --> 25:59.560]  get you as high as this stuff that's 22%.
[25:59.560 --> 26:01.560]  And that's because of terpenes.
[26:01.560 --> 26:03.560]  That's also your entourage
[26:03.860 --> 26:05.860]  effect. Well, we're only really looking
[26:05.860 --> 26:07.860]  at 10 terpene or 10
[26:07.860 --> 26:09.860]  cannabinoids now and there's damn near
[26:09.860 --> 26:11.860]  100. We really
[26:11.860 --> 26:13.860]  focus on the 10.
[26:13.860 --> 26:15.860]  Easier to sell it that way, bro. Yeah, but
[26:15.860 --> 26:17.860]  all the other ones are in such small amounts
[26:17.860 --> 26:19.860]  it's really hard for you to study that.
[26:19.860 --> 26:21.860]  These are the things that, very good
[26:21.860 --> 26:23.860]  point, but these are the differences that make up what you
[26:23.860 --> 26:25.860]  talk about. How as someone that's like
[26:25.860 --> 26:27.860]  a, you know, like a ice smoke
[26:27.860 --> 26:29.860]  flower and it's like, oh, like you just
[26:29.860 --> 26:31.860]  said. Yeah, but every little percentage
[26:32.160 --> 26:34.160]  of what makes up the thing makes it a whole.
[26:34.160 --> 26:36.160]  So, that's actually what
[26:36.160 --> 26:38.160]  gives the effect on you.
[26:38.160 --> 26:40.160]  Yeah, I mean, there's like 130
[26:40.160 --> 26:42.160]  known cannabinoids and about
[26:42.160 --> 26:44.160]  that in terpenes as well. And so
[26:44.160 --> 26:46.160]  it's this big combination of stuff
[26:46.160 --> 26:48.160]  and it's also so subjective because
[26:48.160 --> 26:50.160]  it's funny how
[26:50.160 --> 26:52.160]  one person's response is different
[26:52.160 --> 26:54.160]  than how the next person might respond.
[26:54.160 --> 26:56.160]  Our body chemistry is so
[26:56.160 --> 26:58.160]  different that
[26:58.160 --> 27:00.160]  some people like blue dream and it
[27:00.460 --> 27:02.460]  gets them off the right way and then some people
[27:02.460 --> 27:04.460]  like OG Coach, it works for them
[27:04.460 --> 27:06.460]  and it gets me off the right way. Some people
[27:06.460 --> 27:08.460]  just have to smoke as much as possible because
[27:08.460 --> 27:10.460]  they're trying to get that, you know, a couple grams of THC
[27:10.460 --> 27:12.460]  in every day.
[27:12.460 --> 27:14.460]  That's what it is. And I have a professor
[27:14.460 --> 27:16.460]  friend that gets giggly after a five milligram
[27:16.460 --> 27:18.460]  edible. Yeah,
[27:18.460 --> 27:20.460]  I mean, that's the funny thing. I have friends that take 500
[27:20.460 --> 27:22.460]  milligram edibles. I have friends that
[27:22.460 --> 27:24.460]  get, so I can reveal, I mean,
[27:24.460 --> 27:26.460]  I'm one of those five to ten milligram edible guys.
[27:26.460 --> 27:28.460]  I miss Carova. I miss when Carova
[27:28.760 --> 27:30.760]  had those 500 milligram
[27:30.760 --> 27:32.760]  brownies.
[27:32.760 --> 27:34.760]  That giggling stage was for me
[27:34.760 --> 27:36.760]  when I just started smoking.
[27:36.760 --> 27:38.760]  So I can't know if
[27:38.760 --> 27:40.760]  there's a strain that will
[27:40.760 --> 27:42.760]  do that to me again. You know what I'm saying?
[27:42.760 --> 27:44.760]  Yeah. Probably so.
[27:44.760 --> 27:46.760]  Probably. I smoke some shit that
[27:46.760 --> 27:48.760]  makes me laugh. It's like crazy. And then
[27:48.760 --> 27:50.760]  also, like, when you talk about James with
[27:50.760 --> 27:52.760]  breeding and I always talk
[27:52.760 --> 27:54.760]  to people that are talking
[27:54.760 --> 27:56.760]  about these large scale breeding programs, I'm like,
[27:57.060 --> 27:59.060]  okay, when you do your kind of
[27:59.060 --> 28:01.060]  like analysis,
[28:01.060 --> 28:03.060]  is it all HPLC or are these
[28:03.060 --> 28:05.060]  plants being grown to actually
[28:05.060 --> 28:07.060]  good flower? So
[28:07.060 --> 28:09.060]  on top
[28:09.060 --> 28:11.060]  of the genetics, you need a good grower
[28:11.060 --> 28:13.060]  that can make good flower.
[28:13.060 --> 28:15.060]  The switch has to go all the way.
[28:15.060 --> 28:17.060]  Totally.
[28:17.060 --> 28:19.060]  Yeah, it's a chip.
[28:19.060 --> 28:21.060]  We're having technical
[28:21.060 --> 28:23.060]  difficulties. We're trying to open the window.
[28:23.060 --> 28:25.060]  We're hot box in here. This is like a
[28:25.360 --> 28:27.360]  cross ventilation. We're trying
[28:27.360 --> 28:29.360]  to cross ventilate
[28:29.360 --> 28:31.360]  the room. Apparently that's a trigger word
[28:31.360 --> 28:33.360]  for people in Seattle during the heat wave.
[28:33.360 --> 28:35.360]  Dude, I somehow
[28:35.360 --> 28:37.360]  dodged both heat wave in
[28:37.360 --> 28:39.360]  California and in Seattle
[28:39.360 --> 28:41.360]  when they were having the heat
[28:41.360 --> 28:43.360]  wave here. I was up in Seattle and then
[28:43.360 --> 28:45.360]  vice versa. They got 107
[28:45.360 --> 28:47.360]  in Seattle. That's crazy. That's not
[28:47.360 --> 28:49.360]  right. That's not right.
[28:49.360 --> 28:51.360]  Man, but I really enjoy Seattle. I enjoy their food
[28:51.360 --> 28:53.360]  scene. I enjoy everything about it.
[28:53.660 --> 28:55.660]  I'm trying to figure out how I can
[28:55.660 --> 28:57.660]  finagle my way into a
[28:57.660 --> 28:59.660]  job up there every summer so I can just go
[28:59.660 --> 29:01.660]  for the summer for a month.
[29:01.660 --> 29:03.660]  It's like we were out on Lake Union.
[29:03.660 --> 29:05.660]  It's just amazing.
[29:05.660 --> 29:07.660]  Everything's amazing. I got the
[29:07.660 --> 29:09.660]  4th of July experience up there.
[29:09.660 --> 29:11.660]  So
[29:11.660 --> 29:13.660]  who's got some cool technical questions
[29:13.660 --> 29:15.660]  for Joe since he's really high?
[29:15.660 --> 29:17.660]  No. What? Like
[29:17.660 --> 29:19.660]  a Kimura straight
[29:19.660 --> 29:21.660]  arm bar transition trap?
[29:21.960 --> 29:23.960]  That's the technical stuff I'm ready
[29:23.960 --> 29:25.960]  to talk about. Pollen production is more related
[29:25.960 --> 29:27.960]  to the size of the male or genetics
[29:27.960 --> 29:29.960]  allowing to dump?
[29:29.960 --> 29:31.960]  Oh, dude. I actually
[29:31.960 --> 29:33.960]  haven't worked with a lot of male canvas.
[29:33.960 --> 29:35.960]  Yeah, so put that
[29:35.960 --> 29:37.960]  question back up real quick, Peter.
[29:37.960 --> 29:39.960]  So do I think the pollen production is
[29:39.960 --> 29:41.960]  more related to the size of the male?
[29:41.960 --> 29:43.960]  No, no, no. I think the thing
[29:43.960 --> 29:45.960]  is
[29:45.960 --> 29:47.960]  I think pollen production is
[29:47.960 --> 29:49.960]  very cultivar specific. I
[29:50.260 --> 29:52.260]  don't think it has to do with the size necessarily.
[29:52.260 --> 29:54.260]  But don't try to pollinate
[29:54.260 --> 29:56.260]  like a 24 plant
[29:56.260 --> 29:58.260]  room with like a 6 inch male.
[29:58.260 --> 30:00.260]  You're like, sorry, bro.
[30:00.260 --> 30:02.260]  He can't satisfy
[30:02.260 --> 30:04.260]  those ladies.
[30:04.260 --> 30:06.260]  You're going to get more pollen on a bigger plant.
[30:06.260 --> 30:08.260]  But that's kind of a
[30:08.260 --> 30:10.260]  duh. Not like a 6 inch
[30:10.260 --> 30:12.260]  versus a 3 foot plant.
[30:12.260 --> 30:14.260]  They're talking about genetic disposition to
[30:14.260 --> 30:16.260]  You won't get a 6 inch plant from a seed
[30:16.260 --> 30:18.260]  if you're going to have males. It's just not going to happen.
[30:18.560 --> 30:20.560]  Clone, you might be able to work
[30:20.560 --> 30:22.560]  something right out of tissue culture.
[30:22.560 --> 30:24.560]  I've seen people do interesting forest flowering
[30:24.560 --> 30:26.560]  from very small plants for breeding programs.
[30:26.560 --> 30:28.560]  But I'm always like, you're not going to get
[30:28.560 --> 30:30.560]  a lot of seed from that little 6 inch
[30:30.560 --> 30:32.560]  pollen receptor mom. And they're like,
[30:32.560 --> 30:34.560]  I only need 20 seeds, bro.
[30:34.560 --> 30:36.560]  And I'm like, interesting. At certain
[30:36.560 --> 30:38.560]  stages in the pedigree, why not?
[30:38.560 --> 30:40.560]  20 seeds isn't going
[30:40.560 --> 30:42.560]  to give you much selection, but it might
[30:42.560 --> 30:44.560]  be enough depending on what you're trying to do, I guess.
[30:44.560 --> 30:46.560]  I haven't seen. I didn't see how many
[30:46.860 --> 30:48.860]  I've never been able to only make
[30:48.860 --> 30:50.860]  20 seeds of anything.
[30:50.860 --> 30:52.860]  It's always like you get way more.
[30:52.860 --> 30:54.860]  There's 20 seeds in
[30:54.860 --> 30:56.860]  a fifth of the
[30:56.860 --> 30:58.860]  smallest nugs sometimes.
[31:00.860 --> 31:02.860]  It's real interesting.
[31:02.860 --> 31:04.860]  I've been working with some different reversal
[31:04.860 --> 31:06.860]  sprays. Everything's been real interesting with that.
[31:06.860 --> 31:08.860]  But light spectrum is so huge.
[31:08.860 --> 31:10.860]  If you guys are doing FEMS,
[31:10.860 --> 31:12.860]  I can't even tell you.
[31:12.860 --> 31:14.860]  It's like now for outdoor production,
[31:15.160 --> 31:17.160]  if I'm doing FEMS,
[31:17.160 --> 31:19.160]  we're collecting all the pollen. We're not going to do
[31:19.160 --> 31:21.160]  any sort of field reversals.
[31:21.160 --> 31:23.160]  It has to do with the light intensity and the
[31:23.160 --> 31:25.160]  light spectrum and how the silver works even
[31:25.160 --> 31:27.160]  after it's been applied.
[31:27.160 --> 31:29.160]  On reversals,
[31:29.160 --> 31:31.160]  it's just known
[31:31.160 --> 31:33.160]  that it has to be started before flowering.
[31:33.160 --> 31:35.160]  You can't go into flower
[31:35.160 --> 31:37.160]  and reverse.
[31:37.160 --> 31:39.160]  You
[31:39.160 --> 31:41.160]  typically start your donors a week to
[31:41.160 --> 31:43.160]  10 days ahead.
[31:43.460 --> 31:45.460]  If you're doing reversals, you know
[31:45.460 --> 31:47.460]  what's happening
[31:47.460 --> 31:49.460]  by the time you kick your other plants into flower.
[31:49.460 --> 31:51.460]  Yeah. For sure.
[31:51.460 --> 31:53.460]  I'm just hearing horror stories.
[31:53.460 --> 31:55.460]  It's interesting. Not all plants reverse the same.
[31:55.460 --> 31:57.460]  Just like all males.
[31:57.460 --> 31:59.460]  Not everyone
[31:59.460 --> 32:01.460]  is doing the right thing.
[32:01.460 --> 32:03.460]  When are the compound collabs coming?
[32:03.460 --> 32:05.460]  I don't know. There will be announcements in the future.
[32:05.460 --> 32:07.460]  Double tent technique.
[32:09.460 --> 32:11.460]  Tents in tents.
[32:11.760 --> 32:13.760]  I heard you like tents, so I put a tent in your tent.
[32:13.760 --> 32:15.760]  Honestly, that is how a lot of people
[32:15.760 --> 32:17.760]  build clean, try to do
[32:17.760 --> 32:19.760]  small scale really clean rooms.
[32:19.760 --> 32:21.760]  A lot
[32:21.760 --> 32:23.760]  of people that do home
[32:23.760 --> 32:25.760]  biohacker lab stuff do these
[32:25.760 --> 32:27.760]  kinds of clean rooms.
[32:27.760 --> 32:29.760]  They work.
[32:29.760 --> 32:31.760]  I have seen people put hoods in
[32:31.760 --> 32:33.760]  garages doing these kinds of things.
[32:35.760 --> 32:37.760]  I got an interesting question here
[32:37.760 --> 32:39.760]  about what parts do you spray?
[32:40.060 --> 32:42.060]  If you want to put that one up, Peter.
[32:42.060 --> 32:44.060]  Do I spray the nodes? Do I spray the leaves?
[32:44.060 --> 32:46.060]  I do whole plant.
[32:46.060 --> 32:48.060]  I try to get as much as possible.
[32:48.060 --> 32:50.060]  Obviously, the nodes are the important part.
[32:50.060 --> 32:52.060]  The more you spray that plant
[32:52.060 --> 32:54.060]  and the more you saturate the plant
[32:54.060 --> 32:56.060]  with that silver, I feel like
[32:56.060 --> 32:58.060]  you get better results.
[33:00.060 --> 33:02.060]  They use double tents to keep pollen out.
[33:02.060 --> 33:04.060]  That's what they're talking about.
[33:04.060 --> 33:06.060]  Double tents to keep pollen out.
[33:06.060 --> 33:08.060]  I think part of the thing
[33:08.360 --> 33:10.360]  is if you're doing fem seeds especially,
[33:10.360 --> 33:12.360]  you want to time that right.
[33:12.360 --> 33:14.360]  Your reversals,
[33:14.360 --> 33:16.360]  your donors basically are kicking
[33:16.360 --> 33:18.360]  out the most amount of pollen around
[33:18.360 --> 33:20.360]  week four after the
[33:20.360 --> 33:22.360]  plants are fully developed, week four and a half.
[33:24.360 --> 33:26.360]  I've said some different stuff in the past.
[33:26.360 --> 33:28.360]  It's that sweet spot I think
[33:28.360 --> 33:30.360]  is week four, four and a half
[33:30.360 --> 33:32.360]  where the plants, your receivers are fully
[33:32.360 --> 33:34.360]  developed. Once they're fully developed,
[33:34.360 --> 33:36.360]  that pollen basically, because the second
[33:36.660 --> 33:38.660]  it starts up taking pollen,
[33:38.660 --> 33:40.660]  you're not going to get as much growth.
[33:40.660 --> 33:42.660]  It starts basically,
[33:42.660 --> 33:44.660]  it's not going to
[33:44.660 --> 33:46.660]  grow too much taller. They might grow a little bit
[33:46.660 --> 33:48.660]  taller, but that's when the seed production
[33:48.660 --> 33:50.660]  starts and the plants start doing its
[33:50.660 --> 33:52.660]  thing.
[33:56.660 --> 33:58.660]  Sure, grinding up
[33:58.660 --> 34:00.660]  the dried man
[34:00.660 --> 34:02.660]  in a food processor and allowing it to
[34:02.660 --> 34:04.660]  blow across. I've never tried that. I think it's
[34:04.960 --> 34:06.960]  a great way of doing it. I think it's a great way of
[34:06.960 --> 34:08.960]  spreading disease around your
[34:08.960 --> 34:10.960]  growth if something's wrong with
[34:10.960 --> 34:12.960]  that male. Now they all have
[34:12.960 --> 34:14.960]  vitritis. Sure.
[34:14.960 --> 34:16.960]  That little piece you got airborne?
[34:18.960 --> 34:20.960]  Yeah, there's all kinds of cool stuff.
[34:20.960 --> 34:22.960]  STS, colloidal silver,
[34:22.960 --> 34:24.960]  nano silver.
[34:24.960 --> 34:26.960]  I think experimenting, finding
[34:26.960 --> 34:28.960]  the one that works right for you.
[34:30.960 --> 34:32.960]  Do you see that one
[34:33.260 --> 34:35.260]  on the screen? That was the one I already answered that question.
[34:35.260 --> 34:37.260]  That was the one.
[34:37.260 --> 34:39.260]  With STS
[34:39.260 --> 34:41.260]  or the stem. Basically, do I
[34:41.260 --> 34:43.260]  do the leaves? If I'm using
[34:43.260 --> 34:45.260]  STS, any one of those products,
[34:45.260 --> 34:47.260]  I think my buddy
[34:47.260 --> 34:49.260]  Tim up north was talking about
[34:49.260 --> 34:51.260]  actually one that's systemic that
[34:51.260 --> 34:53.260]  you can actually water the plant with and it'll
[34:53.260 --> 34:55.260]  help reverse it because it's nitrogen
[34:55.260 --> 34:57.260]  based, so it allows uptake in the plant.
[34:57.260 --> 34:59.260]  There's all kinds of cool
[34:59.260 --> 35:01.260]  stuff that we're starting to learn
[35:01.560 --> 35:03.560]  and apply from other
[35:03.560 --> 35:05.560]  parts of agriculture. Which auto
[35:05.560 --> 35:07.560]  feminized female hunting, especially in the
[35:07.560 --> 35:09.560]  reg?
[35:09.560 --> 35:11.560]  There's all these questions. Which
[35:11.560 --> 35:13.560]  one was that?
[35:13.560 --> 35:15.560]  There's a Joe one.
[35:15.560 --> 35:17.560]  Actually, earlier, Joe, just because you're high
[35:17.560 --> 35:19.560]  right now. This is...
[35:19.560 --> 35:21.560]  Oh, bro. Yeah, so that's
[35:21.560 --> 35:23.560]  a great question. Roots,
[35:23.560 --> 35:25.560]  but roots are so hard to test
[35:25.560 --> 35:27.560]  because they so often come
[35:27.560 --> 35:29.560]  with
[35:29.860 --> 35:31.860]  with dirt
[35:31.860 --> 35:33.860]  and stuff, so it'll mess up the
[35:33.860 --> 35:35.860]  PCR and the extraction.
[35:35.860 --> 35:37.860]  90% of my sampling
[35:37.860 --> 35:39.860]  that I do PCR testing
[35:39.860 --> 35:41.860]  for hobbling viroid from is
[35:41.860 --> 35:43.860]  leaves, petiole, stems.
[35:43.860 --> 35:45.860]  However,
[35:45.860 --> 35:47.860]  and then yeah, so that's the majority.
[35:47.860 --> 35:49.860]  Like I said, the vast majority of the
[35:49.860 --> 35:51.860]  DNA, RNA extractions that I do are
[35:51.860 --> 35:53.860]  from those kind of tissues because it's like stuff that
[35:53.860 --> 35:55.860]  people can bring to me where I can
[35:55.860 --> 35:57.860]  physically sample from a growth easily.
[35:58.160 --> 36:00.160]  I've worked with people in the
[36:00.160 --> 36:02.160]  citrus industry that have worked on
[36:02.160 --> 36:04.160]  hops, stunts, viroid, and
[36:04.160 --> 36:06.160]  stuff like that. And in citrus,
[36:06.160 --> 36:08.160]  they have this whole thing where
[36:08.160 --> 36:10.160]  it's a very different plant. It grows for
[36:10.160 --> 36:12.160]  10 years or many more years.
[36:12.160 --> 36:14.160]  But they're like in these trees,
[36:14.160 --> 36:16.160]  a lot of viroids, they can reside
[36:16.160 --> 36:18.160]  in the roots when they don't reside in the rest of
[36:18.160 --> 36:20.160]  the plant. So
[36:20.160 --> 36:22.160]  I'm kind of still doing research
[36:22.160 --> 36:24.160]  on those kinds of ideas in
[36:24.160 --> 36:26.160]  Canvas now. But like I said,
[36:26.460 --> 36:28.460]  the majority of the stuff that's tested and is pretty
[36:28.460 --> 36:30.460]  damn representative
[36:30.460 --> 36:32.460]  is stem, petiole,
[36:32.460 --> 36:34.460]  leaf, mostly systemic
[36:36.460 --> 36:38.460]  symptomatic tissue. And
[36:38.460 --> 36:40.460]  when I do a lot of like my
[36:40.460 --> 36:42.460]  in vitro plant tissue
[36:42.460 --> 36:44.460]  culture, test tube plant
[36:44.460 --> 36:46.460]  testing,
[36:46.460 --> 36:48.460]  I'm taking like half of the little plant
[36:48.460 --> 36:50.460]  so it's like representative biomass,
[36:50.460 --> 36:52.460]  which you can't do,
[36:52.460 --> 36:54.460]  which you can do when your plant is only two inches
[36:54.760 --> 36:56.760]  tall. But that's
[36:56.760 --> 36:58.760]  just a thing. Out in
[36:58.760 --> 37:00.760]  the field, I'm just constantly testing leaves.
[37:00.760 --> 37:02.760]  Like when I visit places,
[37:02.760 --> 37:04.760]  if shit's fucked up, I
[37:04.760 --> 37:06.760]  stick it in a tester, right?
[37:06.760 --> 37:08.760]  Variegated leaves, dutted flower.
[37:08.760 --> 37:10.760]  People will be like, what's wrong with
[37:10.760 --> 37:12.760]  this flower? And I'm like, how old is it?
[37:12.760 --> 37:14.760]  Or even like if I'm like, oh, you're on
[37:14.760 --> 37:16.760]  day
[37:16.760 --> 37:18.760]  whatever, I'm like, if you're this far in a flower
[37:18.760 --> 37:20.760]  and it doesn't smell right,
[37:20.760 --> 37:22.760]  I've walked into rooms and
[37:23.060 --> 37:25.060]  I'm like, this room smells like it's dutted, right?
[37:25.060 --> 37:27.060]  Because of how
[37:27.060 --> 37:29.060]  fragrant and what smells
[37:29.060 --> 37:31.060]  I should be smelling from certain strains. I can only
[37:31.060 --> 37:33.060]  really do this with maybe four or five flower
[37:33.060 --> 37:35.060]  rooms, but I'm pretty damn proud of myself.
[37:35.060 --> 37:37.060]  I'm like, oh, this strain
[37:37.060 --> 37:39.060]  should smell like this by this week.
[37:39.060 --> 37:41.060]  And if the smell isn't there, I'm
[37:41.060 --> 37:43.060]  very fucking concerned, right?
[37:43.060 --> 37:45.060]  But this is how well you need
[37:45.060 --> 37:47.060]  to know your rooms, right?
[37:47.060 --> 37:49.060]  I'm constantly telling people you need
[37:49.060 --> 37:51.060]  to know what your plants look like and smell
[37:51.360 --> 37:53.360]  like and feel like and touch.
[37:53.360 --> 37:55.360]  And a lot of growers
[37:55.360 --> 37:57.360]  or many people, they're
[37:57.360 --> 37:59.360]  forced to work so hard
[37:59.360 --> 38:01.360]  that they're just trying to push as many, push
[38:01.360 --> 38:03.360]  as much stuff through the systems they can.
[38:03.360 --> 38:05.360]  And I'm like, yo, if there's diseases up in
[38:05.360 --> 38:07.360]  this shit, you're not going to get the best
[38:07.360 --> 38:09.360]  yield from the other side. So you got to
[38:09.360 --> 38:11.360]  stop and like, it
[38:11.360 --> 38:13.360]  hurts to throw away sick plants, but I'm the
[38:13.360 --> 38:15.360]  sweet angel of death in a lot of grows.
[38:15.360 --> 38:17.360]  And it's fucked up because I know how much money
[38:17.360 --> 38:19.360]  that is, but I'm like, you might
[38:19.660 --> 38:21.660]  have to throw away everything.
[38:21.660 --> 38:23.660]  I think the model moving forward is you
[38:23.660 --> 38:25.660]  have hoplite testing in your nursery
[38:25.660 --> 38:27.660]  and anything that tests for hoplite, you throw it away.
[38:27.660 --> 38:29.660]  I guess Jay Beasy's
[38:29.660 --> 38:31.660]  doing that. I heard from
[38:31.660 --> 38:33.660]  Chris who visited, that he's literally
[38:33.660 --> 38:35.660]  testing leaf samples
[38:35.660 --> 38:37.660]  of everything that they have and if it
[38:37.660 --> 38:39.660]  tests for... Every test costs money
[38:39.660 --> 38:41.660]  and every test costs
[38:41.660 --> 38:43.660]  money and time. So I have a friend
[38:43.660 --> 38:45.660]  Ian Cole at Zen Leaf
[38:45.660 --> 38:47.660]  in San Diego. He's a Jujutsu
[38:47.960 --> 38:49.960]  ground belt and I've talked with him
[38:49.960 --> 38:51.960]  about him using this Agdia
[38:51.960 --> 38:53.960]  machine by this
[38:53.960 --> 38:55.960]  plant pathology testing company
[38:55.960 --> 38:57.960]  called Agdia and it's like a 10K
[38:57.960 --> 38:59.960]  machine that does this isothermal
[38:59.960 --> 39:01.960]  reaction. It's a
[39:01.960 --> 39:03.960]  alternative PCR. I'll
[39:03.960 --> 39:05.960]  talk about it later.
[39:05.960 --> 39:07.960]  But
[39:07.960 --> 39:09.960]  it's this handheld machine
[39:09.960 --> 39:11.960]  that can do six samples at a time
[39:11.960 --> 39:13.960]  and it's 20 minutes
[39:13.960 --> 39:15.960]  and it's very good for
[39:16.260 --> 39:18.260]  for
[39:18.260 --> 39:20.260]  confirming positives.
[39:20.260 --> 39:22.260]  For being like, oh, we're positive
[39:22.260 --> 39:24.260]  that it's not there, I still
[39:24.260 --> 39:26.260]  use traditional PCR testing
[39:26.260 --> 39:28.260]  methods. But like you said, people are
[39:28.260 --> 39:30.260]  folding in this kind of checking. Guys,
[39:30.260 --> 39:32.260]  it's just like IPM. 20 years ago
[39:32.260 --> 39:34.260]  people would have told me, get the fuck out
[39:34.260 --> 39:36.260]  of my grow. Why do you even
[39:36.260 --> 39:38.260]  have bleach or whatever?
[39:38.260 --> 39:40.260]  These are new regulations, guys.
[39:40.260 --> 39:42.260]  I'm like, in the future, guys, you're not
[39:42.260 --> 39:44.260]  going to be able to use Eagle 20. I'm from the future.
[39:44.560 --> 39:46.560]  I'm just telling you, don't depend on it
[39:46.560 --> 39:48.560]  so hard.
[39:48.560 --> 39:50.560]  But as an industry,
[39:50.560 --> 39:52.560]  we've evolved and changed and hoplite and viru is
[39:52.560 --> 39:54.560]  just going to be another thing that we have
[39:54.560 --> 39:56.560]  to deal with and you're going to be like, damn,
[39:56.560 --> 39:58.560]  we've got to throw that out. It's funny how COVID and hoplite
[39:58.560 --> 40:00.560]  and viru came out around the same time.
[40:00.560 --> 40:02.560]  Dude, hoplite and viru, I've been screaming out about this shit
[40:02.560 --> 40:04.560]  since 2017.
[40:04.560 --> 40:06.560]  It was symptomatic back in the early days.
[40:06.560 --> 40:08.560]  Oh no, it got bad. It's gotten
[40:08.560 --> 40:10.560]  very bad in the last few years.
[40:10.560 --> 40:12.560]  But it's really good.
[40:12.860 --> 40:14.860]  Someone asked me a question and I could not answer
[40:14.860 --> 40:16.860]  so I'm going to ask you guys a question.
[40:16.860 --> 40:18.860]  What does aphid
[40:18.860 --> 40:20.860]  do to your plant?
[40:20.860 --> 40:22.860]  Aphids? What do aphids do
[40:22.860 --> 40:24.860]  to your plants? They friggin
[40:24.860 --> 40:26.860]  suck the life out of it?
[40:26.860 --> 40:28.860]  They feed on it.
[40:28.860 --> 40:30.860]  But what they...
[40:30.860 --> 40:32.860]  Sorry, I'm reading the thingies.
[40:32.860 --> 40:34.860]  Right.
[40:34.860 --> 40:36.860]  What about aphids?
[40:36.860 --> 40:38.860]  What do aphids do to your plants?
[40:38.860 --> 40:40.860]  They fucking kill everything.
[40:41.160 --> 40:43.160]  Are you talking about spreading diseases?
[40:43.160 --> 40:45.160]  Are you talking about spreading diseases?
[40:45.160 --> 40:47.160]  Alright.
[40:47.160 --> 40:49.160]  Let me see.
[40:49.160 --> 40:51.160]  If you've ever seen an aphid infestation,
[40:51.160 --> 40:53.160]  it's nasty.
[40:53.160 --> 40:55.160]  Where they grow up the stem.
[40:55.160 --> 40:57.160]  It's just white stuff.
[40:57.160 --> 40:59.160]  It's just a bunch of grains of rice.
[40:59.160 --> 41:01.160]  Bigger, not that big.
[41:01.160 --> 41:03.160]  They're flatter and shinier.
[41:03.160 --> 41:05.160]  It's disgusting, but it is very rice-like.
[41:05.160 --> 41:07.160]  It looks like crawling rice.
[41:07.160 --> 41:09.160]  I'm sure the person was trying to
[41:09.460 --> 41:11.460]  salvage what he could, but he was asking
[41:11.460 --> 41:13.460]  if the aphid
[41:13.460 --> 41:15.460]  passes on any...
[41:15.460 --> 41:17.460]  So...
[41:17.460 --> 41:19.460]  I've worked with a bunch of groups now
[41:19.460 --> 41:21.460]  Can aphids pass on hoplin?
[41:21.460 --> 41:23.460]  Let me tell a story.
[41:23.460 --> 41:25.460]  I'm still not 100% sure.
[41:25.460 --> 41:27.460]  I don't really think so, but
[41:27.460 --> 41:29.460]  possibly.
[41:29.460 --> 41:31.460]  And if you have aphids,
[41:31.460 --> 41:33.460]  there's probably other problems
[41:33.460 --> 41:35.460]  that it might also be.
[41:35.460 --> 41:37.460]  I know that I've worked with closed warehouses
[41:37.760 --> 41:39.760]  that had things like root aphids
[41:39.760 --> 41:41.760]  and fucking thrips
[41:41.760 --> 41:43.760]  and also hoplatin viroid.
[41:43.760 --> 41:45.760]  And we got rid of
[41:45.760 --> 41:47.760]  all of the hoplatin viroid,
[41:47.760 --> 41:49.760]  but the fucking thrips were there the whole time.
[41:49.760 --> 41:51.760]  Right?
[41:51.760 --> 41:53.760]  And, you know, we're all...
[41:53.760 --> 41:55.760]  Certain places just have
[41:55.760 --> 41:57.760]  systemic problems sometimes.
[41:57.760 --> 41:59.760]  And they're just going to be dealing with it
[41:59.760 --> 42:01.760]  because of a field a mile away
[42:01.760 --> 42:03.760]  or something.
[42:03.760 --> 42:05.760]  So I feel for people, and I'm always like,
[42:06.060 --> 42:08.060]  be careful about where you set shit up.
[42:08.060 --> 42:10.060]  And then sometimes you just got to deal.
[42:10.060 --> 42:12.060]  It's just life, right?
[42:12.060 --> 42:14.060]  So I think that
[42:14.060 --> 42:16.060]  aphids and thrips might be spreading other things.
[42:18.060 --> 42:20.060]  Like, dude, it's so hard to not think about it, right?
[42:20.060 --> 42:22.060]  Sure, Camila, exactly.
[42:22.060 --> 42:24.060]  But it's like,
[42:24.060 --> 42:26.060]  there are these systems of how
[42:26.060 --> 42:28.060]  plant pathogens can actually
[42:28.060 --> 42:30.060]  replicate inside pests.
[42:30.060 --> 42:32.060]  Holler at Cinch Angel
[42:32.060 --> 42:34.060]  on Instagram
[42:34.360 --> 42:36.360]  where they're teaching you about a lot of these bug things.
[42:36.360 --> 42:38.360]  And it's like, hoplatin viroid
[42:38.360 --> 42:40.360]  is this naked RNA that doesn't
[42:40.360 --> 42:42.360]  have the proteins to stick to
[42:42.360 --> 42:44.360]  the bug parts.
[42:44.360 --> 42:46.360]  Very technical, right guys?
[42:46.360 --> 42:48.360]  So I'm like,
[42:48.360 --> 42:50.360]  in many experiments that were
[42:50.360 --> 42:52.360]  forced kind of infections,
[42:52.360 --> 42:54.360]  it was always mechanical inoculations
[42:54.360 --> 42:56.360]  that passed hoplatin viroid.
[42:56.360 --> 42:58.360]  And you're like, well, how about the first one?
[42:58.360 --> 43:00.360]  How does it get in?
[43:00.360 --> 43:02.360]  And you're like, oh, it's usually genetics.
[43:02.660 --> 43:04.660]  And I'm almost like, I've ground up
[43:04.660 --> 43:06.660]  some bugs and not really
[43:06.660 --> 43:08.660]  tested for it, but I haven't done
[43:08.660 --> 43:10.660]  exhaustive studies on this, and I'm not really a bug
[43:10.660 --> 43:12.660]  researcher person.
[43:12.660 --> 43:14.660]  An entomologist.
[43:14.660 --> 43:16.660]  Aphids have 50
[43:16.660 --> 43:18.660]  known viruses of viroids.
[43:18.660 --> 43:20.660]  Exactly.
[43:20.660 --> 43:22.660]  Plum aphids can pass hoplatin
[43:22.660 --> 43:24.660]  as far as I know. Yes.
[43:24.660 --> 43:26.660]  Okay.
[43:26.660 --> 43:28.660]  That's great.
[43:28.660 --> 43:30.660]  That's good to know.
[43:30.960 --> 43:32.960]  I mean, it would make sense
[43:32.960 --> 43:34.960]  just like Zika.
[43:38.960 --> 43:40.960]  Leafhoppers are definitely spreading
[43:40.960 --> 43:42.960]  around
[43:48.960 --> 43:50.960]  beet curly top virus
[43:50.960 --> 43:52.960]  in Colorado.
[43:52.960 --> 43:54.960]  I've seen some beet curly top here.
[43:54.960 --> 43:56.960]  It's funny, I was at a Grow.
[43:56.960 --> 43:58.960]  I sent you those pictures, and it was definitely
[43:59.260 --> 44:01.260]  beet curly top. We're seeing it in California
[44:01.260 --> 44:03.260]  too. I don't know if you guys have seen it.
[44:03.260 --> 44:05.260]  It's really funny looking. You're getting really
[44:05.260 --> 44:07.260]  morphed growth.
[44:07.260 --> 44:09.260]  It's mutated growth, and it looks real
[44:09.260 --> 44:11.260]  funky.
[44:11.260 --> 44:13.260]  Fruit flies 25 degrees.
[44:13.260 --> 44:15.260]  I'm not saying
[44:15.260 --> 44:17.260]  and putting out there that bugs don't
[44:17.260 --> 44:19.260]  spread viruses
[44:19.260 --> 44:21.260]  and viroids. I've gone through the
[44:21.260 --> 44:23.260]  literature as well. I'm talking about
[44:23.260 --> 44:25.260]  specifically which ones are spreading
[44:25.260 --> 44:27.260]  hoplatin viroid in cannabis.
[44:27.560 --> 44:29.560]  I'm like, shit, I need
[44:29.560 --> 44:31.560]  to work with more people about
[44:31.560 --> 44:33.560]  this because
[44:33.560 --> 44:35.560]  what's
[44:35.560 --> 44:37.560]  interesting with COVID too is
[44:37.560 --> 44:39.560]  academic publishing has been on pause.
[44:39.560 --> 44:41.560]  People are still submitting papers
[44:41.560 --> 44:43.560]  and papers are getting published, but
[44:43.560 --> 44:45.560]  it's slowed down a lot of shit.
[44:45.560 --> 44:47.560]  With no
[44:47.560 --> 44:49.560]  conferences,
[44:49.560 --> 44:51.560]  there are no
[44:51.560 --> 44:53.560]  the cannabis
[44:53.560 --> 44:55.560]  scientific community has gotten
[44:55.860 --> 44:57.860]  hit by COVID too. Lots of people
[44:57.860 --> 44:59.860]  have been hit by COVID, but
[44:59.860 --> 45:01.860]  just in the
[45:01.860 --> 45:03.860]  16, 17, 18, there was this
[45:03.860 --> 45:05.860]  starting groundswell of
[45:05.860 --> 45:07.860]  academic
[45:07.860 --> 45:09.860]  science research conferences
[45:09.860 --> 45:11.860]  were finally allowing us to come
[45:11.860 --> 45:13.860]  in and present cannabis science and
[45:13.860 --> 45:15.860]  research. This was spurring a lot
[45:15.860 --> 45:17.860]  of academic collaborations.
[45:19.860 --> 45:21.860]  Friends I have at Madison, Wisconsin,
[45:21.860 --> 45:23.860]  shout out to Shelby Ellison, PhD
[45:24.160 --> 45:26.160]  professor at Madison.
[45:26.160 --> 45:28.160]  I've been doing guest lectures
[45:28.160 --> 45:30.160]  at places, Clemson University,
[45:30.160 --> 45:32.160]  Jeffrey Attleberg, Zach
[45:32.160 --> 45:34.160]  Spock at US Nursery.
[45:34.160 --> 45:36.160]  COVID
[45:36.160 --> 45:38.160]  really put a hamper on things.
[45:38.160 --> 45:40.160]  A lot of
[45:40.160 --> 45:42.160]  collaborations got, people
[45:42.160 --> 45:44.160]  can't see each other and talk about
[45:44.160 --> 45:46.160]  the research that's been happening. We were all
[45:46.160 --> 45:48.160]  sharing data and
[45:48.160 --> 45:50.160]  information and, hey, yo, I did these.
[45:50.160 --> 45:52.160]  People would put
[45:52.460 --> 45:54.460]  up a poster or
[45:54.460 --> 45:56.460]  give talks about, these are our presentations
[45:56.460 --> 45:58.460]  about where CT values
[45:58.460 --> 46:00.460]  are with Hoplite and Viroid, or
[46:00.460 --> 46:02.460]  what's the latest with asymptomatic plants
[46:02.460 --> 46:04.460]  versus symptomatic plants.
[46:04.460 --> 46:06.460]  Even subreddits
[46:06.460 --> 46:08.460]  had meltdowns during COVID.
[46:08.460 --> 46:10.460]  That's why everyone's
[46:10.460 --> 46:12.460]  looking forward to MJ BizCon this year
[46:12.460 --> 46:14.460]  and 2022, but
[46:14.460 --> 46:16.460]  who knows what's going to happen
[46:16.460 --> 46:18.460]  in the upcoming months.
[46:18.460 --> 46:20.460]  I got a special dinner I'm doing. We'll probably
[46:20.760 --> 46:22.760]  have one or two people that are watching
[46:22.760 --> 46:24.760]  the show as it gets closer, as long
[46:24.760 --> 46:26.760]  as it's happening. It's going to be a fun dinner.
[46:26.760 --> 46:28.760]  These guys will both be there.
[46:28.760 --> 46:30.760]  It should be a lot.
[46:30.760 --> 46:32.760]  MJ Biz, man, I can't wait. I really like
[46:32.760 --> 46:34.760]  MJ Biz. MJ Biz
[46:34.760 --> 46:36.760]  and Spanavis, which are kind of polar
[46:36.760 --> 46:38.760]  opposites, are two of my favorite shows
[46:38.760 --> 46:40.760]  and I'm really looking forward to both
[46:40.760 --> 46:42.760]  of them.
[46:42.760 --> 46:44.760]  In both places, I get to see people I haven't seen
[46:44.760 --> 46:46.760]  in a long time and people I just don't normally
[46:46.760 --> 46:48.760]  call, but then you bump into them and it's like no time
[46:49.060 --> 46:51.060]  has passed. You got to love that.
[46:51.060 --> 46:53.060]  Because the industry, it's small, but
[46:53.060 --> 46:55.060]  it's big, but there's a lot of people and everyone's so
[46:55.060 --> 46:57.060]  busy.
[46:57.060 --> 46:59.060]  It went back to
[46:59.060 --> 47:01.060]  people. October 21st, 2nd and 3rd.
[47:01.060 --> 47:03.060]  It went back to people
[47:03.060 --> 47:05.060]  working in vacuums almost
[47:05.060 --> 47:07.060]  and people that got
[47:07.060 --> 47:09.060]  in recently into cannabis
[47:09.060 --> 47:11.060]  that weren't used to working in that
[47:11.060 --> 47:13.060]  kind of isolation.
[47:13.060 --> 47:15.060]  It was really hard for a lot of people
[47:15.060 --> 47:17.060]  and then all of the OGs
[47:17.360 --> 47:19.360]  were like, yo, this is how it was in the 90s.
[47:19.360 --> 47:21.360]  We didn't know nobody.
[47:21.360 --> 47:23.360]  It's a different world
[47:23.360 --> 47:25.360]  with legalization.
[47:25.360 --> 47:27.360]  I think even over in Spain,
[47:27.360 --> 47:29.360]  it sounds like the laws are changing.
[47:29.360 --> 47:31.360]  There's been problems with seed companies over there.
[47:33.360 --> 47:35.360]  What is Pakistani cultivars
[47:35.360 --> 47:37.360]  that show a few pollen sacks
[47:37.360 --> 47:39.360]  late flowering plants?
[47:41.360 --> 47:43.360]  What do I think of Pakistani cultivars
[47:43.360 --> 47:45.360]  that show a few pollen sacks
[47:45.660 --> 47:47.660]  on late flowering plants?
[47:47.660 --> 47:49.660]  I mean, I personally
[47:49.660 --> 47:51.660]  The Gathering of the Chats!
[47:51.660 --> 47:53.660]  Is that someone's name on there?
[47:53.660 --> 47:55.660]  No, someone said that MJ Biz
[47:55.660 --> 47:57.660]  is The Gathering of the Chats!
[47:57.660 --> 47:59.660]  There is that side
[47:59.660 --> 48:01.660]  of The Gathering of the Chats.
[48:01.660 --> 48:03.660]  He's laughing about The Gathering of the Chats.
[48:03.660 --> 48:05.660]  As far as Pakistani traits, I'm not big on stuff
[48:05.660 --> 48:07.660]  that...
[48:07.660 --> 48:09.660]  I pretty much cull stuff that herms.
[48:09.660 --> 48:11.660]  If it's showing intersexual traits,
[48:11.660 --> 48:13.660]  unless it has some amazing...
[48:13.960 --> 48:15.960]  If it's tested and it has some amazing quality,
[48:15.960 --> 48:17.960]  that's something that could be bred out.
[48:17.960 --> 48:19.960]  I wouldn't turn it away
[48:19.960 --> 48:21.960]  if you're talking about on a science level.
[48:21.960 --> 48:23.960]  You should probably get it tested
[48:23.960 --> 48:25.960]  and see what kind of profile it has.
[48:25.960 --> 48:27.960]  I think that's the best way to go
[48:27.960 --> 48:29.960]  as far as you have access to sequencing machines
[48:29.960 --> 48:31.960]  and start sequencing shit.
[48:31.960 --> 48:33.960]  Everyone is welcoming cannabis.
[48:33.960 --> 48:35.960]  I'm not anti-Chad or Brent or Preston.
[48:35.960 --> 48:37.960]  Everyone's welcoming cannabis.
[48:37.960 --> 48:39.960]  I'm anti-ego.
[48:39.960 --> 48:41.960]  I try to be anti-ego.
[48:42.260 --> 48:44.260]  Jiu-Jitsu helped you with that, bro.
[48:44.260 --> 48:46.260]  I was going to say, we should have
[48:46.260 --> 48:48.260]  a cannabis BJJ Kumite.
[48:48.260 --> 48:50.260]  I think Masonic started it.
[48:50.260 --> 48:52.260]  He was ready.
[48:52.260 --> 48:54.260]  That's why I've been training every day.
[48:58.260 --> 49:00.260]  We've got all kinds of good stuff
[49:00.260 --> 49:02.260]  coming in on the chat, guys.
[49:02.260 --> 49:04.260]  I want to give a shout out to Uncle Stoner.
[49:04.260 --> 49:06.260]  He said he's watching the show.
[49:06.260 --> 49:08.260]  He's going to be one of the people from the Hemp Fest.
[49:08.260 --> 49:10.260]  He just texted me saying he's watching
[49:10.560 --> 49:12.560]  the show right now.
[49:12.560 --> 49:14.560]  Him and Master Bong.
[49:14.560 --> 49:16.560]  There's a bunch of people that I met
[49:16.560 --> 49:18.560]  that weekend.
[49:18.560 --> 49:20.560]  It was a really interesting weekend.
[49:20.560 --> 49:22.560]  I've been selling seeds to dispensaries
[49:22.560 --> 49:24.560]  for years before that, but that was
[49:24.560 --> 49:26.560]  my first
[49:26.560 --> 49:28.560]  cannabis booth that I did.
[49:28.560 --> 49:30.560]  I went to the High Times Cannabis Cups
[49:30.560 --> 49:32.560]  before that.
[49:32.560 --> 49:34.560]  We went to all kinds of events.
[49:34.560 --> 49:36.560]  I've been going to cups and different things,
[49:36.560 --> 49:38.560]  but that was the first.
[49:38.860 --> 49:40.860]  Make a firm of
[49:40.860 --> 49:42.860]  Ganja Farmer OG.
[49:42.860 --> 49:44.860]  You know what? That's definitely
[49:44.860 --> 49:46.860]  coming in the future. We had it before.
[49:46.860 --> 49:48.860]  We already...
[49:48.860 --> 49:50.860]  The Ganja Farmer OG was from the past.
[49:50.860 --> 49:52.860]  We released that in 2014 under Loud Seeds.
[49:54.860 --> 49:56.860]  We have one in the future. I just found a bag
[49:56.860 --> 49:58.860]  of some Ganja Farmer SFV.
[49:58.860 --> 50:00.860]  It's the Sonoma
[50:00.860 --> 50:02.860]  which made the original Ganja Farmer.
[50:02.860 --> 50:04.860]  I found a bag of a whole bunch
[50:04.860 --> 50:06.860]  of regs. There's probably
[50:07.160 --> 50:09.160]  5,000 that we're going to pick through
[50:09.160 --> 50:11.160]  for a new OG cultivar.
[50:11.160 --> 50:13.160]  There's a whole bunch of stuff in that.
[50:13.160 --> 50:15.160]  We're going to find something interesting.
[50:15.160 --> 50:17.160]  That's definitely coming soon.
[50:17.160 --> 50:19.160]  Someone brought up Phytoplasma
[50:19.160 --> 50:21.160]  which is also known as
[50:21.160 --> 50:23.160]  Witch's Broom Disease
[50:23.160 --> 50:25.160]  in plants. That is also present
[50:25.160 --> 50:27.160]  and not super prevalent,
[50:27.160 --> 50:29.160]  but I've seen that shit in Oakland
[50:29.160 --> 50:31.160]  and pictures of it in Oregon
[50:31.160 --> 50:33.160]  and Nevada.
[50:33.160 --> 50:35.160]  Phytoplasma is
[50:35.460 --> 50:37.460]  a kind of bacteria.
[50:37.460 --> 50:39.460]  It lacks a cell wall and it's a plant
[50:39.460 --> 50:41.460]  pathogen.
[50:41.460 --> 50:43.460]  The plant curls up and
[50:43.460 --> 50:45.460]  it looks like an old mop.
[50:45.460 --> 50:47.460]  An old, tiny, gray,
[50:47.460 --> 50:49.460]  all tattered mop.
[50:51.460 --> 50:53.460]  It's spread largely
[50:53.460 --> 50:55.460]  I think by...
[50:57.460 --> 50:59.460]  Your tools spread everything
[50:59.460 --> 51:01.460]  around the grow.
[51:01.460 --> 51:03.460]  Hoplite and Viroid, viruses,
[51:03.760 --> 51:05.760]  Cooties,
[51:05.760 --> 51:07.760]  Botrytis.
[51:07.760 --> 51:09.760]  I always talk to people
[51:09.760 --> 51:11.760]  about tool sanitation and getting
[51:11.760 --> 51:13.760]  your employees to actually care.
[51:13.760 --> 51:15.760]  More than 50%
[51:15.760 --> 51:17.760]  of a good grow,
[51:17.760 --> 51:19.760]  of a good operation, good company.
[51:19.760 --> 51:21.760]  Just have
[51:21.760 --> 51:23.760]  people not spread shit around.
[51:25.760 --> 51:27.760]  I think leaf hoppers can spread Phytoplasmas.
[51:29.760 --> 51:31.760]  These things just pop up
[51:32.060 --> 51:34.060]  and disappear.
[51:34.060 --> 51:36.060]  People have these crazy ideas,
[51:36.060 --> 51:38.060]  or not crazy, but very valid ideas
[51:38.060 --> 51:40.060]  about what are these wild reservoirs
[51:40.060 --> 51:42.060]  for diseases.
[51:42.060 --> 51:44.060]  People are studying
[51:44.060 --> 51:46.060]  about how things are hopping
[51:46.060 --> 51:48.060]  back and forth from hops
[51:48.060 --> 51:50.060]  into cannabis
[51:50.060 --> 51:52.060]  that are not Hoplite and Viroid,
[51:52.060 --> 51:54.060]  but Hopstunt and Viroid.
[51:54.060 --> 51:56.060]  There's like
[51:56.060 --> 51:58.060]  feral hemp all over America.
[51:58.060 --> 52:00.060]  All over.
[52:00.360 --> 52:02.360]  There's weed.
[52:04.360 --> 52:06.360]  These diseases go
[52:06.360 --> 52:08.360]  into that and can always hop back.
[52:08.360 --> 52:10.360]  It's the skizzers, Yogi.
[52:10.360 --> 52:12.360]  Yogi Buddha. It's the skizzers, bro.
[52:12.360 --> 52:14.360]  It's the skizzers
[52:14.360 --> 52:16.360]  spreading the shit.
[52:16.360 --> 52:18.360]  I'm very technical.
[52:18.360 --> 52:20.360]  It's very technical.
[52:20.360 --> 52:22.360]  People just need to
[52:22.360 --> 52:24.360]  sterilize your tools, use disposables
[52:24.360 --> 52:26.360]  or not.
[52:26.360 --> 52:28.360]  Just contact
[52:28.660 --> 52:30.660]  time. You can't just touch it for
[52:30.660 --> 52:32.660]  a second and everything's good.
[52:36.660 --> 52:38.660]  Is dressing your soil beds with wild mushrooms safe?
[52:40.660 --> 52:42.660]  Are we talking about Korean natural
[52:42.660 --> 52:44.660]  ... K&F?
[52:44.660 --> 52:46.660]  What is it? K&F?
[52:46.660 --> 52:48.660]  They're like, I found these
[52:48.660 --> 52:50.660]  mushrooms in the forest.
[52:50.660 --> 52:52.660]  It's going to make my living soil bed mycelium.
[52:54.660 --> 52:56.660]  I don't know.
[52:56.960 --> 52:58.960]  We shouldn't.
[52:58.960 --> 53:00.960]  Sorry.
[53:00.960 --> 53:02.960]  Sorry.
[53:02.960 --> 53:04.960]  Sorry.
[53:06.960 --> 53:08.960]  Be careful what you source your genetics.
[53:08.960 --> 53:10.960]  That is for sure.
[53:10.960 --> 53:12.960]  There's about 2,000 seed companies
[53:12.960 --> 53:14.960]  that are making seeds.
[53:14.960 --> 53:16.960]  I would say there's
[53:16.960 --> 53:18.960]  a whole bunch of good
[53:18.960 --> 53:20.960]  seed companies now.
[53:20.960 --> 53:22.960]  Making elite stuff, there's only a handful.
[53:22.960 --> 53:24.960]  There's guys doing their thing like JJ
[53:25.260 --> 53:27.260]  from Top Dog.
[53:27.260 --> 53:29.260]  That dude crushes.
[53:29.260 --> 53:31.260]  He's stuck with his guns and guts.
[53:31.260 --> 53:33.260]  He's done the same kind of stuff.
[53:33.260 --> 53:35.260]  He's very chem, gas forward
[53:35.260 --> 53:37.260]  and making quality genetics.
[53:37.260 --> 53:39.260]  He's off a beaten path.
[53:39.260 --> 53:41.260]  Whereas I think a lot of people
[53:41.260 --> 53:43.260]  realize that they've got to make gelato
[53:43.260 --> 53:45.260]  crosses because everything's selling gelato.
[53:45.260 --> 53:47.260]  I'm no exception.
[53:47.260 --> 53:49.260]  I try to do everything.
[53:49.260 --> 53:51.260]  I'm diverse.
[53:51.260 --> 53:53.260]  What are they talking about?
[53:53.560 --> 53:55.560]  Psychedelic mushrooms in the soil.
[53:55.560 --> 53:57.560]  That's where I was going with this.
[53:57.560 --> 53:59.560]  That's where I was going with this.
[53:59.560 --> 54:01.560]  I'm not talking shit on
[54:01.560 --> 54:03.560]  anyway. I'm just asking questions.
[54:03.560 --> 54:05.560]  They're like
[54:05.560 --> 54:07.560]  I don't know about if we know enough.
[54:07.560 --> 54:09.560]  I don't know.
[54:09.560 --> 54:11.560]  What do you think?
[54:11.560 --> 54:13.560]  We can look at past trends
[54:13.560 --> 54:15.560]  and talk about identifying future trends.
[54:15.560 --> 54:17.560]  Where the cannabis industry is going.
[54:17.560 --> 54:19.560]  Terpene
[54:19.560 --> 54:21.560]  and as far as aromatics.
[54:21.860 --> 54:23.860]  What direction is it going?
[54:23.860 --> 54:25.860]  Is it going to stay with gelato
[54:25.860 --> 54:27.860]  and then with the different forms of gelato?
[54:27.860 --> 54:29.860]  Where do you guys think it's going in the chat?
[54:29.860 --> 54:31.860]  We're talking about K&F again.
[54:31.860 --> 54:33.860]  Man, they have K&F groups.
[54:33.860 --> 54:35.860]  Did I just upset you?
[54:35.860 --> 54:37.860]  No, no, no.
[54:37.860 --> 54:39.860]  It's fine.
[54:39.860 --> 54:41.860]  What part of Trinidad are you from Marlon?
[54:41.860 --> 54:43.860]  I'm from Trinidad.
[54:43.860 --> 54:45.860]  Not from Jamaica.
[54:45.860 --> 54:47.860]  I'm from Trinidad and Tobago.
[54:47.860 --> 54:49.860]  I'm from Jamaica.
[54:50.160 --> 54:52.160]  I'm from Trinidad and Tobago.
[54:52.160 --> 54:54.160]  It's a beautiful country.
[54:54.160 --> 54:56.160]  I was there before.
[54:56.160 --> 54:58.160]  Not psychedelic.
[54:58.160 --> 55:00.160]  Gelato.
[55:00.160 --> 55:02.160]  Worm Guinness into the morning.
[55:02.160 --> 55:04.160]  Worm Guinness into the early morning.
[55:04.160 --> 55:06.160]  They drink extra bitter worm Guinness in Trinidad.
[55:06.160 --> 55:08.160]  We were working in St. Vincent in Trinidad.
[55:08.160 --> 55:10.160]  It looks like there's some people online
[55:10.160 --> 55:12.160]  that are back over there right now working.
[55:12.160 --> 55:14.160]  St. Vincent's a beautiful place.
[55:14.160 --> 55:16.160]  I think there's a lot of potential.
[55:16.160 --> 55:18.160]  THCV.
[55:18.460 --> 55:20.460]  What's up with the latest on THCV
[55:20.460 --> 55:22.460]  aside from Ken's Bavaria?
[55:22.460 --> 55:24.460]  It's starting to go like friggin' ...
[55:24.460 --> 55:26.460]  Basically, I would say
[55:26.460 --> 55:28.460]  that THCV was supposed to be
[55:28.460 --> 55:30.460]  the next hot thing.
[55:30.460 --> 55:32.460]  The price of it was too expensive
[55:32.460 --> 55:34.460]  for isolating it.
[55:34.460 --> 55:36.460]  There's people doing it.
[55:36.460 --> 55:38.460]  Now that there's more of it,
[55:38.460 --> 55:40.460]  people aren't talking about it as much.
[55:40.460 --> 55:42.460]  I think it has huge, huge, huge potential.
[55:42.460 --> 55:44.460]  Are we going to drop the glue lotto again?
[55:44.460 --> 55:46.460]  We may,
[55:46.760 --> 55:48.760]  but it's not going to be for a while.
[55:48.760 --> 55:50.760]  Dude, loud cannagenics stuff
[55:50.760 --> 55:52.760]  is friggin' pretty much sold out.
[55:52.760 --> 55:54.760]  We had a good year.
[55:54.760 --> 55:56.760]  I think just wait
[55:56.760 --> 55:58.760]  until the next loud cannagenics release.
[55:58.760 --> 56:00.760]  We got some really crazy stuff going on.
[56:00.760 --> 56:02.760]  I've been working with those guys
[56:02.760 --> 56:04.760]  and I've been sourcing some genetics.
[56:04.760 --> 56:06.760]  They've been sourcing some genetics.
[56:06.760 --> 56:08.760]  We're going to do some insane shit.
[56:08.760 --> 56:10.760]  Yes, everything is sweet now.
[56:10.760 --> 56:12.760]  I have friends like that
[56:12.760 --> 56:14.760]  that are like all the weed is sweet now
[56:15.060 --> 56:17.060]  as far as flavors that are very popular
[56:17.060 --> 56:19.060]  on the market in the last few years.
[56:19.060 --> 56:21.060]  I was like, stop making fun of me
[56:21.060 --> 56:23.060]  for liking things like Purple Punch.
[56:23.060 --> 56:25.060]  I think that it's more diverse now
[56:25.060 --> 56:27.060]  than...
[56:27.060 --> 56:29.060]  It's interesting.
[56:29.060 --> 56:31.060]  It is, but it's all on subtleties.
[56:31.060 --> 56:33.060]  Most of the stuff out there,
[56:33.060 --> 56:35.060]  if we're talking about exotics,
[56:35.060 --> 56:37.060]  is all in the same wheelhouse.
[56:37.060 --> 56:39.060]  You're not seeing OG Cush being...
[56:39.060 --> 56:41.060]  What was that one again, Peter?
[56:41.060 --> 56:43.060]  They were talking about the line
[56:43.360 --> 56:45.360]  Everything is sweet now.
[56:45.360 --> 56:47.360]  There's great gas nowadays.
[56:47.360 --> 56:49.360]  I think the best stuff is layered.
[56:49.360 --> 56:51.360]  I wouldn't say that it's just sweet.
[56:51.360 --> 56:53.360]  Maybe it has that as one of the checkboxes.
[56:53.360 --> 56:55.360]  The skilly.
[56:55.360 --> 56:57.360]  As a nose front,
[56:57.360 --> 56:59.360]  but still the gas is always there.
[56:59.360 --> 57:01.360]  Yes, gas.
[57:01.360 --> 57:03.360]  Look at the menthol stuff coming from compound.
[57:03.360 --> 57:05.360]  That's a great example
[57:05.360 --> 57:07.360]  of how Chris is taking that in.
[57:07.360 --> 57:09.360]  Menthol as far as gas,
[57:09.360 --> 57:11.360]  but layered with stuff.
[57:11.660 --> 57:13.660]  Chris was on here talking about layering
[57:13.660 --> 57:15.660]  and checking all the boxes.
[57:15.660 --> 57:17.660]  OG Cush is having its renaissance
[57:17.660 --> 57:19.660]  across the country.
[57:19.660 --> 57:21.660]  When is the Cat Piss Cup?
[57:21.660 --> 57:23.660]  Sorry, I just interrupted you.
[57:23.660 --> 57:25.660]  Cat Piss Cup, we'll see.
[57:25.660 --> 57:27.660]  Adam Dunn and I are talking.
[57:27.660 --> 57:29.660]  We're calling it the Cultivar Cup.
[57:29.660 --> 57:31.660]  We're switching it so it's not just
[57:31.660 --> 57:33.660]  Cat Piss or OG Cush.
[57:33.660 --> 57:35.660]  It's going to be a few different things.
[57:35.660 --> 57:37.660]  Those will be the categories.
[57:37.660 --> 57:39.660]  We're going to piggyback.
[57:39.960 --> 57:41.960]  I would like to do our first one in New York.
[57:41.960 --> 57:43.960]  Big ups to everybody in New York City.
[57:43.960 --> 57:45.960]  We would like to do our first one over there.
[57:45.960 --> 57:47.960]  I think there's some other stuff.
[57:47.960 --> 57:49.960]  Cat Piss, we're definitely going to do a Cat Piss.
[57:49.960 --> 57:51.960]  I'm supposed to go get some Cat Piss
[57:51.960 --> 57:53.960]  from 707. He's got some saved for me.
[57:53.960 --> 57:55.960]  You guys talk to him.
[57:55.960 --> 57:57.960]  Tell him I said what's up.
[57:57.960 --> 57:59.960]  I'm ready for that piss.
[57:59.960 --> 58:01.960]  One of my favorites.
[58:01.960 --> 58:03.960]  I can't wait to get the real Cat Piss.
[58:03.960 --> 58:05.960]  We're going to find it.
[58:05.960 --> 58:07.960]  We're going to figure it out.
[58:08.260 --> 58:10.260]  Even if we have to remake it.
[58:10.260 --> 58:12.260]  I'm looking forward to some of the
[58:12.260 --> 58:14.260]  flower runs we're going to be doing in the next year.
[58:14.260 --> 58:16.260]  You've got to try some of my
[58:16.260 --> 58:18.260]  strains.
[58:18.260 --> 58:20.260]  My Loudberry where we had
[58:20.260 --> 58:22.260]  several Finos that my buddy, my writer.
[58:22.260 --> 58:24.260]  They're all amazing.
[58:24.260 --> 58:26.260]  It's like
[58:26.260 --> 58:28.260]  you gifted me
[58:28.260 --> 58:30.260]  a 35 gram
[58:30.260 --> 58:32.260]  bag and there's
[58:32.260 --> 58:34.260]  I don't know, damn near 15
[58:34.260 --> 58:36.260]  at the bottom. I'm like, damn, thanks dude.
[58:36.560 --> 58:38.560]  It was like
[58:38.560 --> 58:40.560]  6, 8, I forget the numbers.
[58:40.560 --> 58:42.560]  I have it all still.
[58:42.560 --> 58:44.560]  All fire though.
[58:44.560 --> 58:46.560]  I've been asking
[58:46.560 --> 58:48.560]  for that Loudberry for years
[58:48.560 --> 58:50.560]  I realized.
[58:50.560 --> 58:52.560]  And then when you did, you gave me
[58:52.560 --> 58:54.560]  ounces of it.
[58:54.560 --> 58:56.560]  That's the way to do it.
[58:56.560 --> 58:58.560]  But then you get to really experience
[58:58.560 --> 59:00.560]  what I was talking about.
[59:00.560 --> 59:02.560]  Let's talk about Fino hunting for a little bit guys.
[59:02.560 --> 59:04.560]  What that means
[59:04.860 --> 59:06.860]  I think that's the most important part of breeding.
[59:06.860 --> 59:08.860]  I'll go over it and over
[59:08.860 --> 59:10.860]  it again because it's so important.
[59:10.860 --> 59:12.860]  Making seeds is the easy part.
[59:12.860 --> 59:14.860]  Finding those
[59:14.860 --> 59:16.860]  winners, that's the tough part.
[59:16.860 --> 59:18.860]  I think there's people
[59:18.860 --> 59:20.860]  that don't Fino hunt
[59:20.860 --> 59:22.860]  as good as they do seed production.
[59:22.860 --> 59:24.860]  Fino hunting is so important.
[59:24.860 --> 59:26.860]  I used to do it one and done.
[59:26.860 --> 59:28.860]  You grow from seeds, you'd select
[59:28.860 --> 59:30.860]  your winners and maybe grow
[59:30.860 --> 59:32.860]  those guys out again to see how they responded.
[59:33.160 --> 59:35.160]  Sometimes I'll grow stuff that isn't
[59:35.160 --> 59:37.160]  a winner multiple times to see
[59:37.160 --> 59:39.160]  if it changes because with
[59:39.160 --> 59:41.160]  sexual maturity and dialing strains in
[59:41.160 --> 59:43.160]  it could take 2-3 runs.
[59:43.160 --> 59:45.160]  And then the other thing is you have to grow
[59:45.160 --> 59:47.160]  really well for Fino hunting.
[59:47.160 --> 59:49.160]  Yeah, exactly.
[59:49.160 --> 59:51.160]  You can't grow it
[59:51.160 --> 59:53.160]  inferior and then think you're
[59:53.160 --> 59:55.160]  Fino hunting to get something special.
[59:55.160 --> 59:57.160]  It has to be the best grown.
[59:57.160 --> 59:59.160]  The guys up in Seattle, I feel like those guys are really
[59:59.160 --> 01:00:01.160]  good because they're good Fino hunters too.
[01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:03.460]  You have to make the plant express
[01:00:03.460 --> 01:00:05.460]  if you grow it multiple times
[01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:07.460]  and you have to grow it really good.
[01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:09.460]  Fino hunting, if you can't grow it
[01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:11.460]  really well, it's not going to express to its full
[01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:13.460]  capability and then everything
[01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:15.460]  is going to be very similar in your room.
[01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:17.460]  It's really hard to differentiate the winners
[01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:19.460]  if you're not growing them to the full
[01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:21.460]  capability. Although sometimes you get lucky
[01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:23.460]  and everything looks like shit and then
[01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:25.460]  you got one standout.
[01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:27.460]  I have a question for you.
[01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:29.460]  When you Fino hunt, how much of
[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:31.760]  the plant structure is part of
[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:33.760]  your overall hunt?
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:35.760]  It depends.
[01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:37.760]  I'll be honest, I prefer stuff
[01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:39.760]  with great structure now.
[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:41.760]  You wouldn't even make it through?
[01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:43.760]  First of all, structure by itself,
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:45.760]  that's not me.
[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:47.760]  First is terpenes and nose
[01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:49.760]  and then smokability.
[01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:51.760]  Totally.
[01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:53.760]  We look for basically those genotypes
[01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:55.760]  and those ones that are very similar
[01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:57.760]  and we'll
[01:00:58.060 --> 01:01:00.060]  dry them out.
[01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:02.060]  If I can find one with better structure,
[01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:04.060]  I'm going to go with the one for better structure.
[01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:06.060]  Sometimes you got to sacrifice.
[01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:08.060]  In this day and age,
[01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:10.060]  when we're talking about Fino hunting,
[01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:12.060]  if you're doing production
[01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:14.060]  as far as in rec,
[01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:16.060]  you need something that yields.
[01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:18.060]  Everything comes down to dollars.
[01:01:18.060 --> 01:01:20.060]  As far as for my home stuff,
[01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:22.060]  I grow Skittles.
[01:01:22.060 --> 01:01:24.060]  The Skittles cut back because I want to breed with it
[01:01:24.060 --> 01:01:26.060]  some more. We got it up
[01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:28.360]  north and I'm going to go grab it again.
[01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:30.360]  I gravitate towards Skittles.
[01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:32.360]  Marlon too. We gravitate towards smoking it.
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:34.360]  It grows like shit.
[01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:36.360]  It's a garbage grower
[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:38.360]  but as far as like Terps,
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:40.360]  it's one of the best.
[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:42.360]  In parts,
[01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:44.360]  special into the plant where you get that sweetness,
[01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:46.360]  we were talking about sweetness,
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:48.360]  a lot of that comes from the Skittles in it.
[01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:50.360]  That really freaking sweet gassy.
[01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:52.360]  Very good.
[01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:54.360]  Candy. Even more than
[01:01:54.660 --> 01:01:56.660]  sweet, I would say candy.
[01:01:56.660 --> 01:01:58.660]  That's become one of the boxes that we check
[01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:00.660]  to get good cultivars.
[01:02:00.660 --> 01:02:02.660]  It's funny that you say that.
[01:02:02.660 --> 01:02:04.660]  Last time I was in LA, I was with
[01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:06.660]  Pacific Gold
[01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:08.660]  on Instagram.
[01:02:08.660 --> 01:02:10.660]  He had this plant in his backyard
[01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:12.660]  and he was like, hey, go touch that plant.
[01:02:12.660 --> 01:02:14.660]  It was like flowering. I was like,
[01:02:14.660 --> 01:02:16.660]  oh my God, why is this outside
[01:02:16.660 --> 01:02:18.660]  in your backyard?
[01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:20.660]  I can't run that.
[01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:22.660]  The structure is too small.
[01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:24.960]  He just started criticizing
[01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:26.960]  the shit out of it.
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:28.960]  I was like, I get like blah blah blah
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:30.960]  ounces or grams
[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:32.960]  out of that. I was like,
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:34.960]  okay, but can I have
[01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:36.960]  this plant? Can I take this plant home with
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:38.960]  me? No, I'm just joking
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:40.960]  about that last time. Some of those things
[01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:42.960]  you can take and if
[01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:44.960]  you do work to your varieties,
[01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:46.960]  these different cultivars, you can do work to
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:48.960]  them and improve them and capture what
[01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:50.960]  you like and maybe find something even better.
[01:02:51.260 --> 01:02:53.260]  It requires work.
[01:02:53.260 --> 01:02:55.260]  We live in this fucking society where people
[01:02:55.260 --> 01:02:57.260]  don't like working right now. If I can put in the
[01:02:57.260 --> 01:02:59.260]  work and there's
[01:02:59.260 --> 01:03:01.260]  no excuse for you just to have
[01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:03.260]  Skittles by itself. You can
[01:03:03.260 --> 01:03:05.260]  cross it and you can improve it.
[01:03:05.260 --> 01:03:07.260]  A lot of people have done that
[01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:09.260]  and you're seeing stuff where I
[01:03:09.260 --> 01:03:11.260]  don't even think Skittles is always getting credited
[01:03:11.260 --> 01:03:13.260]  but it's in a lot of stuff.
[01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:17.260]  You can take those. You can breed better
[01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:19.260]  structure into stuff. You can
[01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:21.560]  breed more intense turps and stuff
[01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:23.560]  but if you're working with stuff that's
[01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:25.560]  less turpy, don't cross it
[01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:27.560]  with stuff and expect to get more turps.
[01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:29.560]  If you have mild nose but it
[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:31.560]  looks absolutely amazing
[01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:33.560]  and you cross it with something else that doesn't have turps.
[01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:35.560]  If you take two things that don't have turps,
[01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:37.560]  you're not going to get more turps in your
[01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:39.560]  variety whatever you're crossing.
[01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:41.560]  I think there's one thing having
[01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:43.560]  stuff that looks amazing and has amazing
[01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:45.560]  bag appeal. It's another thing having something
[01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:47.560]  that smokes amazing. The smokeability
[01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:51.560]  of the actual flower ground up whether
[01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:53.560]  it's greasy or dry.
[01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:55.560]  Once it's cured, those things are amazing.
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:57.560]  That's what interests me.
[01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:03.560]  Turpines are the availability
[01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:05.560]  of THC, CBD to enter your bloodstream.
[01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:09.560]  Skittles, Cushman. Haven't had Skittles, Cushman.
[01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:11.560]  It sounds great.
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:15.730]  Lemon, Pudgeline,
[01:04:15.730 --> 01:04:17.730]  you find.
[01:04:17.730 --> 01:04:19.730]  I'm seeing more.
[01:04:20.030 --> 01:04:22.030]  We talked about
[01:04:22.030 --> 01:04:24.030]  lemon Pudgeline,
[01:04:24.030 --> 01:04:26.030]  that lemony, hazy
[01:04:26.030 --> 01:04:28.030]  as far as them
[01:04:28.030 --> 01:04:30.030]  being bigger and produce more.
[01:04:30.030 --> 01:04:32.030]  Those plants typically, we're talking
[01:04:32.030 --> 01:04:34.030]  about stuff like equatorial
[01:04:34.030 --> 01:04:36.030]  tropical varieties.
[01:04:36.030 --> 01:04:38.030]  Someone said, got to be
[01:04:38.030 --> 01:04:40.030]  rememberable. I'm like, that's such a great
[01:04:40.030 --> 01:04:42.030]  way to put it.
[01:04:42.030 --> 01:04:44.030]  A lot of people
[01:04:44.030 --> 01:04:46.030]  you just see the same crosses over and over
[01:04:46.030 --> 01:04:48.030]  and over again
[01:04:48.330 --> 01:04:50.330]  throughout different
[01:04:50.330 --> 01:04:52.330]  I'm fascinated by the regions of genetics
[01:04:52.330 --> 01:04:54.330]  because you could tell
[01:04:54.330 --> 01:04:56.330]  you're like, oh, that's when
[01:04:56.330 --> 01:04:58.330]  Girl Scout cookies got passed around
[01:04:58.330 --> 01:05:00.330]  and started getting passed, crossed into things.
[01:05:00.330 --> 01:05:02.330]  Gorilla Glue had its heyday,
[01:05:02.330 --> 01:05:04.330]  got moved into new states and then started
[01:05:04.330 --> 01:05:06.330]  getting crossing of things.
[01:05:06.330 --> 01:05:08.330]  It had impacts on it.
[01:05:08.330 --> 01:05:10.330]  Certain things like Emerald Cups,
[01:05:10.330 --> 01:05:12.330]  Cannabis Cups were events when
[01:05:12.330 --> 01:05:14.330]  certain cuts got distroed
[01:05:14.330 --> 01:05:16.330]  widely for the first time
[01:05:16.630 --> 01:05:18.630]  and people start crossing to it.
[01:05:18.630 --> 01:05:20.630]  If you don't have things that are diverse
[01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:22.630]  enough to make something that
[01:05:22.630 --> 01:05:24.630]  is memorable enough,
[01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:26.630]  you're like, how do you
[01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:28.630]  know what's a 10?
[01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:30.630]  What do weed nerds talk about?
[01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:32.630]  What's this hypothetical, idealized
[01:05:32.630 --> 01:05:34.630]  10? You're like, but
[01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:36.630]  what if you don't know if you have a three?
[01:05:36.630 --> 01:05:38.630]  Let's go back to talking about the Lemon Pledge.
[01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:40.630]  All right.
[01:05:40.630 --> 01:05:42.630]  Joke gets really big. It's good. I love it.
[01:05:42.630 --> 01:05:44.630]  Anyways, sorry.
[01:05:44.930 --> 01:05:46.930]  We're talking about the memorable.
[01:05:46.930 --> 01:05:48.930]  Now we're going to go back on the Lemon Pledge
[01:05:48.930 --> 01:05:50.930]  and how I feel about
[01:05:50.930 --> 01:05:52.930]  Lemon Pledge. I think the biggest thing
[01:05:52.930 --> 01:05:54.930]  with Lemon Pledge,
[01:05:54.930 --> 01:05:56.930]  I would say if we're talking about lemon,
[01:05:56.930 --> 01:05:58.930]  hazy lemon,
[01:05:58.930 --> 01:06:00.930]  strong lemon, I think
[01:06:00.930 --> 01:06:02.930]  when you talk about those leaners, it's a dominant
[01:06:02.930 --> 01:06:04.930]  trait that can get passed on fairly easy.
[01:06:04.930 --> 01:06:06.930]  Jack Terps, we're talking about, Steph.
[01:06:06.930 --> 01:06:08.930]  That citrus,
[01:06:08.930 --> 01:06:10.930]  that lemon citrusy
[01:06:10.930 --> 01:06:12.930]  funk. Those are very
[01:06:13.230 --> 01:06:15.230]  you'll find variations from
[01:06:15.230 --> 01:06:17.230]  train wreck to Jack
[01:06:17.230 --> 01:06:19.230]  to these hazes that all have
[01:06:19.230 --> 01:06:21.230]  similarities. Those are very dominant.
[01:06:21.230 --> 01:06:23.230]  They're dominant traits.
[01:06:23.230 --> 01:06:25.230]  As far as getting on bigger plants,
[01:06:25.230 --> 01:06:27.230]  you can find that in smaller. You can find that
[01:06:27.230 --> 01:06:29.230]  in bigger because it's a dominant trait. You could put it
[01:06:29.230 --> 01:06:31.230]  on an Indica. There's definitely
[01:06:31.230 --> 01:06:33.230]  stuff that's more of that
[01:06:33.230 --> 01:06:35.230]  broad leaf, really short plant,
[01:06:35.230 --> 01:06:37.230]  short node spacing
[01:06:37.230 --> 01:06:39.230]  type structure. You can get lemon on those.
[01:06:39.230 --> 01:06:41.230]  No problem.
[01:06:43.230 --> 01:06:45.230]  If you want piffs,
[01:06:45.230 --> 01:06:47.230]  look for piff. People
[01:06:47.230 --> 01:06:49.230]  liking that piff. We're going to do the
[01:06:49.230 --> 01:06:51.230]  piff cup too. That's going to be in New York.
[01:06:51.230 --> 01:06:53.230]  Someone's talking about
[01:06:53.230 --> 01:06:55.230]  GDP. They're like, no love for GDP.
[01:06:55.230 --> 01:06:57.230]  I love Granddaddy Purple.
[01:06:57.230 --> 01:06:59.230]  I just don't love growing it.
[01:06:59.230 --> 01:07:01.230]  The whole thing with GDP, I have a love-hate
[01:07:01.230 --> 01:07:03.230]  relationship. I used to grow
[01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:05.230]  these octagons, these huge
[01:07:05.230 --> 01:07:07.230]  octagons that were like eight feet tall
[01:07:07.230 --> 01:07:09.230]  and there was
[01:07:09.230 --> 01:07:11.230]  four rows of Dutch pots.
[01:07:11.530 --> 01:07:13.530]  They were these five-gallon rectangle pots
[01:07:13.530 --> 01:07:15.530]  that have drainage in the back.
[01:07:15.530 --> 01:07:17.530]  You have a
[01:07:17.530 --> 01:07:19.530]  center cool tube and
[01:07:19.530 --> 01:07:21.530]  then you have lights in the middle of it.
[01:07:21.530 --> 01:07:23.530]  I tried growing a
[01:07:23.530 --> 01:07:25.530]  chem dog in there and I got this
[01:07:25.530 --> 01:07:27.530]  wall of larv.
[01:07:27.530 --> 01:07:29.530]  Actually, one of my friends
[01:07:29.530 --> 01:07:31.530]  discovered putting GDP in there
[01:07:31.530 --> 01:07:33.530]  instead.
[01:07:33.530 --> 01:07:35.530]  For every thousand
[01:07:35.530 --> 01:07:37.530]  watt, there was 26 plants. We used to yield
[01:07:37.530 --> 01:07:39.530]  massive out of these things back in the day.
[01:07:39.830 --> 01:07:41.830]  We had a footprint so we could put them in our
[01:07:41.830 --> 01:07:43.830]  garage and we didn't have to worry about helicopters.
[01:07:43.830 --> 01:07:45.830]  GDP was the one that
[01:07:45.830 --> 01:07:47.830]  you could actually
[01:07:47.830 --> 01:07:49.830]  grow it in there. It would grow out
[01:07:49.830 --> 01:07:51.830]  towards the light but it would never touch it
[01:07:51.830 --> 01:07:53.830]  because it takes 31 days to veg properly.
[01:07:55.830 --> 01:07:57.830]  I'm going to be honest. I can't say
[01:07:57.830 --> 01:07:59.830]  to many strains I've run across.
[01:07:59.830 --> 01:08:01.830]  I'm not into.
[01:08:01.830 --> 01:08:03.830]  God bless you, man.
[01:08:03.830 --> 01:08:05.830]  Everything's dope.
[01:08:05.830 --> 01:08:07.830]  It's so subjective and it's stuff grown really well.
[01:08:08.130 --> 01:08:10.130]  I'm sure someone's just like
[01:08:10.130 --> 01:08:12.130]  you're a bunch of assholes. We're so hard to grow
[01:08:12.130 --> 01:08:14.130]  this stuff.
[01:08:14.130 --> 01:08:16.130]  We got some
[01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:18.130]  structural problems.
[01:08:18.130 --> 01:08:20.130]  Everyone knows that the
[01:08:20.130 --> 01:08:22.130]  strain that grows well and when you get
[01:08:22.130 --> 01:08:24.130]  that smoke and you're comfortable
[01:08:24.130 --> 01:08:26.130]  and you feel relaxed
[01:08:26.130 --> 01:08:28.130]  and that's the one you're going to lean
[01:08:28.130 --> 01:08:30.130]  to.
[01:08:30.130 --> 01:08:32.130]  Cherry pie, GDP.
[01:08:32.130 --> 01:08:34.130]  It reminds me. It holds me dear
[01:08:34.130 --> 01:08:36.130]  because it reminds me of the time.
[01:08:36.430 --> 01:08:38.430]  I was like yeah, headband reminds me
[01:08:38.430 --> 01:08:40.430]  of 2008.
[01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:42.430]  My headband experience
[01:08:42.430 --> 01:08:44.430]  was a little earlier than that but it was
[01:08:44.430 --> 01:08:46.430]  OG Kush relabeled his headband.
[01:08:46.430 --> 01:08:48.430]  From Mojave,
[01:08:48.430 --> 01:08:50.430]  that story's been told on the podcast
[01:08:50.430 --> 01:08:52.430]  how headband, one of the cuts
[01:08:52.430 --> 01:08:54.430]  of headband, there's multiple but one of them was
[01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:56.430]  just OG Kush, Josh DoG
[01:08:56.430 --> 01:08:58.430]  through Superfire.
[01:09:00.430 --> 01:09:02.430]  Burnt rubber skunk
[01:09:02.430 --> 01:09:04.430]  turps in the head
[01:09:04.730 --> 01:09:06.730]  Big up to Ken.
[01:09:06.730 --> 01:09:08.730]  He was a great strain for you.
[01:09:08.730 --> 01:09:10.730]  The real headband.
[01:09:10.730 --> 01:09:12.730]  I got into the game lately.
[01:09:12.730 --> 01:09:14.730]  Sour Diesel's 07.
[01:09:14.730 --> 01:09:16.730]  Super good Sour Diesel reminds me of 2007.
[01:09:16.730 --> 01:09:18.730]  Silverback Growella was doing it
[01:09:18.730 --> 01:09:20.730]  in the early 2000s. This dude was
[01:09:20.730 --> 01:09:22.730]  crushing Sour Diesel.
[01:09:22.730 --> 01:09:24.730]  That was my first
[01:09:24.730 --> 01:09:26.730]  encounter with Sour Diesel
[01:09:26.730 --> 01:09:28.730]  back in New York.
[01:09:28.730 --> 01:09:30.730]  You stayed at Josh's
[01:09:30.730 --> 01:09:32.730]  house up in Santa Rosa. That dude
[01:09:33.030 --> 01:09:35.030]  used to grow these sour plants
[01:09:35.030 --> 01:09:37.030]  that were massive.
[01:09:37.030 --> 01:09:39.030]  I had bottles of that
[01:09:39.030 --> 01:09:41.030]  at my house. I'd been smoking that for months.
[01:09:41.030 --> 01:09:43.030]  Crushing the Sour Diesel.
[01:09:43.030 --> 01:09:45.030]  One of my favorites.
[01:09:45.030 --> 01:09:47.030]  He grew that well.
[01:09:47.030 --> 01:09:49.030]  We wouldn't be here talking today. That's another one
[01:09:49.030 --> 01:09:51.030]  that's so influential on me. Sour Diesel
[01:09:51.030 --> 01:09:53.030]  Loud Seeds
[01:09:53.030 --> 01:09:55.030]  our original Loud,
[01:09:55.030 --> 01:09:57.030]  how that evolved into where we are today.
[01:09:57.030 --> 01:09:59.030]  Sour Diesel's a huge part of that.
[01:09:59.330 --> 01:10:01.330]  Yeah.
[01:10:01.330 --> 01:10:03.330]  I think that's what we were chasing after.
[01:10:03.330 --> 01:10:05.330]  That Sour Diesel finish.
[01:10:05.330 --> 01:10:07.330]  Sour Diesel was the first
[01:10:07.330 --> 01:10:09.330]  cannabis that I've ever smoked
[01:10:09.330 --> 01:10:11.330]  that was well grown.
[01:10:11.330 --> 01:10:13.330]  It was given to me by the dude
[01:10:13.330 --> 01:10:15.330]  that Dan
[01:10:15.330 --> 01:10:17.330]  did extractioneering. I used to grow it indoors
[01:10:17.330 --> 01:10:19.330]  and let it go 12 full weeks.
[01:10:19.330 --> 01:10:21.330]  It would put out
[01:10:21.330 --> 01:10:23.330]  but if you went 10 weeks
[01:10:23.330 --> 01:10:25.330]  you could pull it but it was never
[01:10:25.330 --> 01:10:27.330]  as good as if you went the full.
[01:10:27.630 --> 01:10:29.630]  11 to 12 weeks
[01:10:29.630 --> 01:10:31.630]  it would come out.
[01:10:31.630 --> 01:10:33.630]  It takes too long.
[01:10:33.630 --> 01:10:35.630]  It takes too long to grow Sour Diesel.
[01:10:35.630 --> 01:10:37.630]  That's what everyone says.
[01:10:37.630 --> 01:10:39.630]  When it's done well
[01:10:39.630 --> 01:10:41.630]  it's a good strain.
[01:10:41.630 --> 01:10:43.630]  A lot of people can appreciate
[01:10:43.630 --> 01:10:45.630]  smoking Sour Diesel.
[01:10:45.630 --> 01:10:47.630]  Yeah.
[01:10:47.630 --> 01:10:49.630]  We can talk about VPD
[01:10:49.630 --> 01:10:51.630]  for a minute. Vapor pressure deficit.
[01:10:51.630 --> 01:10:53.630]  I've been dialing my VP
[01:10:53.630 --> 01:10:55.630]  for the first time with seed production.
[01:10:55.930 --> 01:10:57.930]  I'm sure there's guys who have done it
[01:10:57.930 --> 01:10:59.930]  for the longest time.
[01:10:59.930 --> 01:11:01.930]  I resisted because I've always liked
[01:11:01.930 --> 01:11:03.930]  low humidity for seed production.
[01:11:03.930 --> 01:11:05.930]  How low?
[01:11:05.930 --> 01:11:07.930]  Below 50% in flower.
[01:11:07.930 --> 01:11:09.930]  I consider that low.
[01:11:09.930 --> 01:11:11.930]  That's off the VPD chart.
[01:11:11.930 --> 01:11:13.930]  What I was doing is
[01:11:13.930 --> 01:11:15.930]  I got a Trollmaster.
[01:11:15.930 --> 01:11:17.930]  With this Trollmaster
[01:11:17.930 --> 01:11:19.930]  it gives you the VPD.
[01:11:19.930 --> 01:11:21.930]  I started researching more.
[01:11:21.930 --> 01:11:23.930]  I knew about VPD. I understood the basic concepts
[01:11:24.230 --> 01:11:26.230]  but when you're applying it to a flowering room
[01:11:26.230 --> 01:11:28.230]  when you're doing seed production
[01:11:28.230 --> 01:11:30.230]  I feel like my plants got a lot bigger
[01:11:30.230 --> 01:11:32.230]  than I expected them to.
[01:11:36.230 --> 01:11:38.230]  I left it going with the higher humidity
[01:11:38.230 --> 01:11:40.230]  which I run at 82.
[01:11:42.230 --> 01:11:44.230]  That would be like 71% humidity
[01:11:44.230 --> 01:11:46.230]  to get a 1.1 VPD.
[01:11:48.230 --> 01:11:50.230]  He's talking about a vapor pressure deficit.
[01:11:50.230 --> 01:11:52.230]  Right.
[01:11:52.530 --> 01:11:54.530]  What is VPD?
[01:11:54.530 --> 01:11:56.530]  Vapor pressure deficit.
[01:11:56.530 --> 01:11:58.530]  You're trying to
[01:11:58.530 --> 01:12:00.530]  raise the humidity in the room
[01:12:00.530 --> 01:12:02.530]  in balance with the temperature
[01:12:02.530 --> 01:12:04.530]  so it makes the leaf
[01:12:04.530 --> 01:12:06.530]  surface temperature the same as the room.
[01:12:06.530 --> 01:12:08.530]  What does that do?
[01:12:08.530 --> 01:12:10.530]  That allows the plant
[01:12:10.530 --> 01:12:12.530]  to grow optimally.
[01:12:14.530 --> 01:12:16.530]  I was so worried about
[01:12:16.530 --> 01:12:18.530]  powdery mildew.
[01:12:18.530 --> 01:12:20.530]  You do have to worry about powdery mildew
[01:12:20.830 --> 01:12:22.830]  but if your VPD is set
[01:12:22.830 --> 01:12:24.830]  you have to obey the VPD chart.
[01:12:24.830 --> 01:12:26.830]  If your VPD is off
[01:12:26.830 --> 01:12:28.830]  when you're trying to run that high humidity
[01:12:28.830 --> 01:12:30.830]  you'll get PM.
[01:12:30.830 --> 01:12:32.830]  PM is not the worst thing.
[01:12:32.830 --> 01:12:34.830]  It's not the best thing.
[01:12:34.830 --> 01:12:36.830]  It's something you can deal with.
[01:12:36.830 --> 01:12:38.830]  You can burn sulfur which I do not do
[01:12:38.830 --> 01:12:40.830]  when I'm doing stuff that I would smoke.
[01:12:40.830 --> 01:12:42.830]  I stay away from sprays
[01:12:42.830 --> 01:12:44.830]  in flower if I can 100% help it.
[01:12:46.830 --> 01:12:48.830]  What I did is
[01:12:49.130 --> 01:12:51.130]  I'm doing my flick
[01:12:51.130 --> 01:12:53.130]  and I see the dust
[01:12:53.130 --> 01:12:55.130]  and we're talking about pollen flying
[01:12:55.130 --> 01:12:57.130]  and I turn the humidity down
[01:12:57.130 --> 01:12:59.130]  to 40-45
[01:12:59.130 --> 01:13:01.130]  so it'll maintain that.
[01:13:01.130 --> 01:13:03.130]  I did that for a week
[01:13:03.130 --> 01:13:05.130]  and got 100% pollination
[01:13:05.130 --> 01:13:07.130]  and it was one of the worst reversals
[01:13:07.130 --> 01:13:09.130]  I've ever done because I did it under LEDs
[01:13:09.130 --> 01:13:11.130]  trying to experiment.
[01:13:11.130 --> 01:13:13.130]  HPS guys,
[01:13:13.130 --> 01:13:15.130]  if you're doing reversals, stick with HPS.
[01:13:15.130 --> 01:13:17.130]  They work better than the CMHs
[01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:19.430]  and better than the LEDs
[01:13:19.430 --> 01:13:21.430]  and for reversals, using silver better than the sun.
[01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:25.430]  That's my opinion on that.
[01:13:25.430 --> 01:13:27.430]  Through trial and error, HPS is crush.
[01:13:27.430 --> 01:13:29.430]  There's a VPD chart guys.
[01:13:29.430 --> 01:13:31.430]  You can see
[01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:33.430]  if you're running around 82
[01:13:33.430 --> 01:13:35.430]  you want to be in that green zone right there
[01:13:37.430 --> 01:13:39.430]  and this is actually a lot more open
[01:13:39.430 --> 01:13:41.430]  than, we're talking about
[01:13:41.430 --> 01:13:43.430]  oh wait, which one is the VPD?
[01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:45.430]  It's a parade.
[01:13:45.730 --> 01:13:47.730]  Hey, this is all
[01:13:47.730 --> 01:13:49.730]  there's no judging
[01:13:49.730 --> 01:13:51.730]  in this chat room apparently.
[01:13:51.730 --> 01:13:53.730]  VPD in Hawaii is constant
[01:13:53.730 --> 01:13:55.730]  flux like our light levels
[01:13:55.730 --> 01:13:57.730]  in California.
[01:13:57.730 --> 01:13:59.730]  That would have to be an interesting environment to grow in
[01:13:59.730 --> 01:14:01.730]  over there in Hawaii if you could get something
[01:14:01.730 --> 01:14:03.730]  that was pretty much in that.
[01:14:03.730 --> 01:14:05.730]  That VPD range, really your plants
[01:14:05.730 --> 01:14:07.730]  grow optimally and if you want to grow with big yields
[01:14:07.730 --> 01:14:09.730]  obviously the guys that are doing crop steering
[01:14:09.730 --> 01:14:11.730]  really focus on VPD.
[01:14:11.730 --> 01:14:13.730]  I just
[01:14:14.030 --> 01:14:16.030]  I figured I'd keep my humidity low
[01:14:16.030 --> 01:14:18.030]  because I'm worried about pollen.
[01:14:18.030 --> 01:14:20.030]  The more dry the room is, the more dry
[01:14:20.030 --> 01:14:22.030]  the air is, the more that pollen is going to fly
[01:14:22.030 --> 01:14:24.030]  but it doesn't really need to be off
[01:14:24.030 --> 01:14:26.030]  other than when pollen is flying.
[01:14:28.030 --> 01:14:30.030]  It also stresses the plant out a little bit
[01:14:30.030 --> 01:14:32.030]  because it's been in a perfect VPD
[01:14:32.030 --> 01:14:34.030]  so then it's going to release even more pollen.
[01:14:34.030 --> 01:14:36.030]  I feel that's what's contributed
[01:14:36.030 --> 01:14:38.030]  to the last pollination that I did.
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000]  Sorry, I'm getting caught.
[01:14:44.300 --> 01:14:46.300]  If you're not maintaining your CO2
[01:14:46.300 --> 01:14:48.300]  you're losing money. I would agree too.
[01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:50.300]  Those things all need to be in line.
[01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:52.300]  Trollmaster
[01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:54.300]  really makes me happy.
[01:14:54.300 --> 01:14:56.300]  I really love using it. Even for small rooms
[01:14:56.300 --> 01:14:58.300]  I get just the basic Trollmaster
[01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:00.300]  and I do the CO2, I do the temperature
[01:15:00.300 --> 01:15:02.300]  I do the humidity
[01:15:02.300 --> 01:15:04.300]  and I keep it real simple.
[01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:06.300]  Even on that I use, instead of buying
[01:15:06.300 --> 01:15:08.300]  the Aqua X Trollmaster, I have my
[01:15:08.300 --> 01:15:10.300]  small Hydra X and I have a
[01:15:10.300 --> 01:15:12.300]  time controller. Basically for
[01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:14.600]  irrigation, instead of using
[01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:16.600]  a different controller, I just use my Hydra X
[01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:18.600]  on a timer
[01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:20.600]  and so it goes 5 minutes, 3 times a day
[01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:22.600]  whatever your
[01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:24.600]  watering regimen is, you can control it
[01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:26.600]  with a timer.
[01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:28.600]  For folks that don't know too much about VPD
[01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:30.600]  don't feel too bad. You're one of today's
[01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:32.600]  10,000 people that are learning things
[01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:34.600]  for the first time ever.
[01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:36.600]  You should be able to monitor
[01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:38.600]  these things. If you have a big row, you should be
[01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:40.600]  measuring things like what the temperature
[01:15:40.900 --> 01:15:42.900]  is in a bunch of different places, what the humidity
[01:15:42.900 --> 01:15:44.900]  is in a bunch of different places
[01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:46.900]  in your grow, on your plants
[01:15:46.900 --> 01:15:48.900]  your pots
[01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:50.900]  because when things are going wrong
[01:15:50.900 --> 01:15:52.900]  this kind of information is going to
[01:15:52.900 --> 01:15:54.900]  help you know if things
[01:15:54.900 --> 01:15:56.900]  are going well or not.
[01:15:56.900 --> 01:15:58.900]  You want to gather
[01:15:58.900 --> 01:16:00.900]  and collect as much information as you
[01:16:00.900 --> 01:16:02.900]  have
[01:16:02.900 --> 01:16:04.900]  you don't have to be
[01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:06.900]  super religious about the VPD chart
[01:16:06.900 --> 01:16:08.900]  but you should
[01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:11.200]  be conscious of these things.
[01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:13.200]  The VPD chart is great
[01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:15.200]  if you're trying to
[01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:17.200]  optimize your room
[01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:19.200]  and if it's too much
[01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:21.200]  obviously you want to keep your humidity lower
[01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:23.200]  to prevent powdery mildew
[01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:25.200]  but if you're trying to get bigger yields, VPD is a great place to start.
[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:27.200]  You can get VPD charts
[01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:29.200]  online
[01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:31.200]  you can type in future cannabis projects
[01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:33.200]  I'm sure somebody's talked about VPD
[01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:35.200]  Peter will let you know
[01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:37.200]  I'm sure
[01:16:37.500 --> 01:16:39.500]  That's something you should probably get Ramsey on here
[01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:41.500]  one of these guys
[01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:43.500]  to dial it in
[01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:45.500]  but yeah VPD
[01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:47.500]  you can just type it in
[01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:49.500]  YouTube, search for VPD
[01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:51.500]  vapor pressure deficit
[01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:53.500]  CO2 is a pain in the ass
[01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:55.500]  but it's so important
[01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:57.500]  I've been using
[01:16:57.500 --> 01:16:59.500]  CO2 for a long time
[01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:01.500]  Are we going to talk about
[01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:03.500]  the UFC on this show?
[01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:05.500]  I didn't watch UFC last night
[01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:07.800]  I'm a big Derek Lewis fan
[01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:09.800]  I'm a big UFC guy
[01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:11.800]  I love watching UFC
[01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:13.800]  I like boxing
[01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:15.800]  I grew up being scared of Mike Tyson
[01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:17.800]  even though I never met him until 2007
[01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:19.800]  and then he turned out to be one of the nicest guys
[01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:21.800]  but that dude was scary
[01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:23.800]  watching him back in the day
[01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:25.800]  in the ring
[01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:27.800]  I'm a big Derek Lewis fan
[01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:29.800]  I'm a big UFC guy
[01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:31.800]  I love watching UFC
[01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:33.800]  I like boxing
[01:17:34.100 --> 01:17:36.100]  I met him and his voice was soft
[01:17:36.100 --> 01:17:38.100]  like bro
[01:17:38.100 --> 01:17:40.100]  watching it one day later myself as well
[01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:42.100]  yeah
[01:17:42.100 --> 01:17:44.100]  there was a dope D'Arce sequence
[01:17:44.100 --> 01:17:46.100]  nice
[01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:48.100]  we need to do a Jiu Jitsu podcast
[01:17:48.100 --> 01:17:50.100]  for Jiu Jitsu people
[01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:52.100]  or we could do a martial arts
[01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:54.100]  fight club podcast
[01:17:54.100 --> 01:17:56.100]  what do they used to be called?
[01:17:56.100 --> 01:17:58.100]  Fight Companions
[01:17:58.100 --> 01:18:00.100]  we should do a Fight Companion
[01:18:00.100 --> 01:18:02.100]  yeah
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:04.400]  Draft Kings
[01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:06.400]  nice
[01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:08.400]  back to
[01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:10.400]  which one was this?
[01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:12.400]  oh that's Zerios
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:14.400]  we can't even talk about the Zerios right now
[01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:16.400]  but Zerios
[01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:18.400]  is coming
[01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:20.400]  I'm just telling you right now
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:22.400]  Zerios is going to be the next big thing
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:24.400]  I think it has the potential
[01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:26.400]  he's showing the buds off
[01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:28.400]  but yeah it's freaking
[01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:30.400]  Z E E R I O S
[01:18:30.700 --> 01:18:32.700]  and freaking
[01:18:32.700 --> 01:18:34.700]  fire
[01:18:34.700 --> 01:18:36.700]  you can roll that up
[01:18:36.700 --> 01:18:38.700]  yeah
[01:18:38.700 --> 01:18:40.700]  it's another fucking fun
[01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:42.700]  variety
[01:18:42.700 --> 01:18:44.700]  there's just so many
[01:18:44.700 --> 01:18:46.700]  Red Pop is another one I'm excited about
[01:18:46.700 --> 01:18:48.700]  if you guys haven't seen the Red Pop
[01:18:48.700 --> 01:18:50.700]  Red Pop is hot
[01:18:50.700 --> 01:18:52.700]  it's hard to get
[01:18:52.700 --> 01:18:54.700]  what have you guys been smoking on Exotic Wise?
[01:18:58.300 --> 01:19:00.300]  so what's the flavor profile
[01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:02.600]  I would say
[01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:04.600]  it's cereal gas
[01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:08.600]  cereal
[01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:10.600]  it's got that creaminess
[01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:12.600]  I feel like there's the skittly sweet
[01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:14.600]  a little bit
[01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:16.600]  it's got gas
[01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:18.600]  I feel like it checks all the boxes
[01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:20.600]  you burn that roach the next day you're like oh yeah
[01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:22.600]  that was the Zerios
[01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:24.600]  so we've been lucky enough to be smoking it for the last
[01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:26.600]  couple months
[01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:28.600]  I had a lot of
[01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:30.900]  Zerios and
[01:19:30.900 --> 01:19:32.900]  it's something that is going to be
[01:19:32.900 --> 01:19:34.900]  crazy when
[01:19:34.900 --> 01:19:36.900]  I won't lie
[01:19:36.900 --> 01:19:38.900]  it's a hitter
[01:19:38.900 --> 01:19:40.900]  it's a very unique
[01:19:40.900 --> 01:19:42.900]  smoke
[01:19:42.900 --> 01:19:44.900]  wow
[01:19:48.900 --> 01:19:50.900]  what is the longest you've kept
[01:19:50.900 --> 01:19:52.900]  pollen in a jar at room temperature
[01:19:52.900 --> 01:19:54.900]  and was it still viable?
[01:19:54.900 --> 01:19:56.900]  probably like 12 years
[01:19:57.200 --> 01:19:59.200]  I've got some 12 year old pollen it is not viable
[01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:01.200]  at room temperature?
[01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:03.200]  dude I have pollen just sitting in here right now
[01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:05.200]  but as far as viable
[01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:07.200]  I would say I don't keep it at room temperature
[01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:09.200]  if you have it at room temperature
[01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:11.200]  you could probably count
[01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:13.200]  that it's got months
[01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:15.200]  at the very most
[01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:17.200]  if it's moisture free
[01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:19.200]  if there's a tiny little bit of moisture
[01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:21.200]  it's done
[01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:23.200]  you should be keeping it in your fridge with desiccants
[01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:25.200]  desiccants is a great way to go
[01:20:25.500 --> 01:20:27.500]  I use rice flour
[01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:29.500]  I prefer rice flour
[01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:31.500]  to help keep it dry
[01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:33.500]  those things are valuable
[01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:35.500]  so
[01:20:35.500 --> 01:20:37.500]  someone's got a bunch of our
[01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:42.430]  varieties, that's awesome
[01:20:42.430 --> 01:20:44.430]  oh yeah, awesome
[01:20:44.430 --> 01:20:48.860]  how's it going Carlos?
[01:20:48.860 --> 01:20:50.860]  I want to hear more about people's with the juice box too
[01:20:50.860 --> 01:20:52.860]  that's a good variety
[01:20:52.860 --> 01:20:54.860]  and also
[01:20:54.860 --> 01:20:56.860]  I was really impressed
[01:20:56.860 --> 01:20:58.860]  by how many people sent comments
[01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:01.160]  about the friggin
[01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:03.160]  giveaway, our mystery machine
[01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:05.160]  which is the juicy fruit bag seed
[01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:07.160]  a lot of people have grown it and got good stuff
[01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:09.160]  I've been getting tagged all over the place
[01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:13.160]  someone's smoking our
[01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:15.160]  Floralato, Glulato
[01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:17.160]  Lemon Sorbet
[01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:19.160]  we got to call it Lemon Sorbetto
[01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:21.160]  yeah
[01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:23.160]  someone wants to know about the Offendo
[01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:25.160]  if you want those seeds
[01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:27.160]  you better get them quick
[01:21:27.460 --> 01:21:29.460]  IMO Gelato 41
[01:21:29.460 --> 01:21:31.460]  that shit is friggin
[01:21:31.460 --> 01:21:33.460]  ridiculous
[01:21:33.460 --> 01:21:35.460]  I feel like
[01:21:35.460 --> 01:21:37.460]  it shortens the
[01:21:37.460 --> 01:21:39.460]  flowering cycle
[01:21:39.460 --> 01:21:41.460]  as far as if you were talking about the plant
[01:21:41.460 --> 01:21:43.460]  the flowering cycle is short
[01:21:43.460 --> 01:21:45.460]  you don't have to go a full 11 weeks with it
[01:21:45.460 --> 01:21:47.460]  a lot of the stuff is done in 63 to 70 days
[01:21:47.460 --> 01:21:49.460]  at the most
[01:21:49.460 --> 01:21:51.460]  63 ideally
[01:21:51.460 --> 01:21:53.460]  but dude, super
[01:21:53.460 --> 01:21:55.460]  pungent
[01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:57.760]  a lot of the Finos
[01:21:57.760 --> 01:21:59.760]  I like have that Gelato
[01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:01.760]  structure but they're super big
[01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:03.760]  someone just finished a juice box
[01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:05.760]  I'm gonna go talk to them
[01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:07.760]  make sure you tag Ganja Farmer Seed Company
[01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:09.760]  if you got Ganja Farmer Seed Company
[01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:11.760]  growing, send us pictures
[01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:13.760]  tag Marlon, tag me
[01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:15.760]  check it out
[01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:17.760]  Apple Fritters
[01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:19.760]  I am not a big fan of Apple Fritters
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:21.760]  guys, it just doesn't do it for me
[01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:23.760]  it's almost
[01:22:24.060 --> 01:22:26.060]  purple punched, that level
[01:22:26.060 --> 01:22:28.060]  but it's really a disappointment
[01:22:28.060 --> 01:22:30.060]  I feel like it has this apple nose
[01:22:30.060 --> 01:22:32.060]  that's just like
[01:22:32.060 --> 01:22:34.060]  smells like apple fritters or apple pie
[01:22:34.060 --> 01:22:36.060]  when you smell it, but then when you smoke it
[01:22:36.060 --> 01:22:38.060]  it doesn't taste like it smells
[01:22:38.060 --> 01:22:40.060]  for me, I would want to go back to the drawing board
[01:22:40.060 --> 01:22:42.060]  on that and go look for different selections
[01:22:42.060 --> 01:22:44.060]  or kind of beat that into
[01:22:44.060 --> 01:22:46.060]  something where you can get more of a flavor
[01:22:46.060 --> 01:22:48.060]  because it's kind of a
[01:22:48.060 --> 01:22:50.060]  hashy smoke, but it's just not
[01:22:50.060 --> 01:22:52.060]  intense. I had some in San Diego
[01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:54.360]  but I didn't know if it was grown well
[01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:56.360]  I had it grown really well
[01:22:56.360 --> 01:22:58.360]  it looks just to die for
[01:22:58.360 --> 01:23:00.360]  as far as looks it gets a 10
[01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:02.360]  but then it just gives me a little bit of a let down
[01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:04.360]  on the smoke
[01:23:04.360 --> 01:23:06.360]  yep, Apple Fritters sucks, there we go
[01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:08.360]  people hatin'
[01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:10.360]  but yeah, and then you know
[01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:12.360]  apples and bananas, that's another one
[01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:14.360]  so I have to say apples and bananas grown really well
[01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:16.360]  it's fucking
[01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:18.360]  it's ridiculous, it reminds me of the wildlife
[01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:20.360]  it's got so much flavor
[01:23:20.660 --> 01:23:22.660]  you exhale and you still have that taste
[01:23:22.660 --> 01:23:24.660]  in your mouth for like a minute, two minutes
[01:23:24.660 --> 01:23:26.660]  you go floss your teeth
[01:23:26.660 --> 01:23:28.660]  and you're like, oh shit, apples and bananas
[01:23:28.660 --> 01:23:30.660]  that's when you know it's good
[01:23:34.660 --> 01:23:36.660]  and I was saying it was the best strain of the year
[01:23:36.660 --> 01:23:38.660]  you know, we're
[01:23:38.660 --> 01:23:40.660]  months after, I mean I definitely think apples
[01:23:40.660 --> 01:23:42.660]  and bananas is up there, I think the zeroes
[01:23:42.660 --> 01:23:44.660]  did you just pull a 180 on apples and bananas?
[01:23:44.660 --> 01:23:46.660]  no, no, not at all
[01:23:46.660 --> 01:23:48.660]  as far as best strain of the year
[01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:50.960]  up to that point it was the best strain
[01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:52.960]  and now I feel like there's definitely contenders with it
[01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:54.960]  but I feel like it, grown well
[01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:56.960]  I feel like it's the best terp profile
[01:23:56.960 --> 01:23:58.960]  of the stuff I've smoked this year
[01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:00.960]  nice, but I mean, Zope is up there too
[01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:02.960]  that Zope, the zeroes
[01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:04.960]  dude, there's a bunch of stuff
[01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:06.960]  the jokers
[01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:08.960]  jokers is good, I don't know, apples and bananas
[01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:10.960]  I think is a little better than the jokers
[01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:12.960]  but still, jokers has an amazing structure
[01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:14.960]  I haven't had enough to make a good opinion
[01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:16.960]  banana OG crosses
[01:24:17.260 --> 01:24:19.260]  banana OG crosses you recommend?
[01:24:19.260 --> 01:24:21.260]  I don't know about other people's banana OG crosses
[01:24:21.260 --> 01:24:23.260]  I got, dude, I have some crazy banana crosses
[01:24:23.260 --> 01:24:25.260]  though that I haven't released
[01:24:25.260 --> 01:24:27.260]  I think we're going to try to breed into some gelato
[01:24:27.260 --> 01:24:29.260]  or some skittles or some shit
[01:24:29.260 --> 01:24:31.260]  but
[01:24:31.260 --> 01:24:33.260]  apple fritters
[01:24:33.260 --> 01:24:35.260]  apple fritters
[01:24:35.260 --> 01:24:37.260]  banana mac
[01:24:37.260 --> 01:24:39.260]  pancakes
[01:24:39.260 --> 01:24:41.260]  pancakes from a fish and I was pretty good
[01:24:41.260 --> 01:24:43.260]  man, I saw some packs of it coming down
[01:24:43.260 --> 01:24:45.260]  and I was like
[01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:47.560]  I think it's good
[01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:49.560]  does it taste like pancakes to me? Jealousy, that's another good one guys
[01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:51.560]  that jealousy cut is super fire
[01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:53.560]  that's what Justin got me
[01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:55.560]  that was pancakes
[01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:57.560]  yeah, it's from a fish and I know that shit's fire
[01:24:57.560 --> 01:24:59.560]  in-house pancakes
[01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:01.560]  I have not seen
[01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:03.560]  in-house pancakes
[01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:05.560]  yeah
[01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:07.560]  Justin from Apricot got
[01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:09.560]  yeah, that was
[01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:11.560]  Gary Payton
[01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:13.560]  and pancakes
[01:25:13.860 --> 01:25:15.860]  yeah, big ups to the original pancake house in Portland
[01:25:15.860 --> 01:25:17.860]  man, I grew up going there
[01:25:17.860 --> 01:25:19.860]  that place is fire, if you're ever in Portland
[01:25:19.860 --> 01:25:21.860]  original pancake house
[01:25:21.860 --> 01:25:23.860]  I'm gonna have to go to Portland
[01:25:23.860 --> 01:25:25.860]  you used to have to wait in line on the weekends to get in
[01:25:25.860 --> 01:25:27.860]  but Swedish pancakes
[01:25:27.860 --> 01:25:29.860]  all kinds of shit, it's really good
[01:25:29.860 --> 01:25:31.860]  cheese strains
[01:25:31.860 --> 01:25:33.860]  what do you guys think of cheese?
[01:25:33.860 --> 01:25:35.860]  I think that
[01:25:35.860 --> 01:25:37.860]  I like cheese, I like the cheese grown in Europe
[01:25:37.860 --> 01:25:39.860]  I enjoy smoking it when I go over there
[01:25:39.860 --> 01:25:41.860]  because you don't see it here
[01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:44.160]  I think it's okay
[01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:46.160]  but it's something I wouldn't smoke all the time
[01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:48.160]  but I really, really, really
[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:50.160]  my friends in Barcelona
[01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:52.160]  and in the Netherlands, those guys
[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:54.160]  grow some fire ass cheese
[01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:56.160]  Mike V said what's hype might not be the best medicine
[01:25:56.160 --> 01:25:58.160]  that's totally true, a lot of medicinal users
[01:25:58.160 --> 01:26:00.160]  I know are very like
[01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:02.160]  this is what I smoke
[01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:04.160]  cereal milk for sure
[01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:06.160]  fire, Gary Payton
[01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:08.160]  fire
[01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:10.160]  huh, it's funny because
[01:26:10.460 --> 01:26:12.460]  I like all these new cuts, those are definitely
[01:26:12.460 --> 01:26:14.460]  ocean beach, if you guys try ocean beach
[01:26:14.460 --> 01:26:16.460]  that shit's fire
[01:26:16.460 --> 01:26:18.460]  there's a lot of good fire out there
[01:26:18.460 --> 01:26:20.460]  juice box, that's fire
[01:26:20.460 --> 01:26:22.460]  I'm a teak here, oh yeah
[01:26:22.460 --> 01:26:24.460]  there's lots of juice box
[01:26:24.460 --> 01:26:26.460]  in the ground outdoors
[01:26:26.460 --> 01:26:28.460]  it's funny seeing pictures of some of my
[01:26:28.460 --> 01:26:30.460]  varieties
[01:26:30.460 --> 01:26:32.460]  some I made and some I collaborated with
[01:26:32.460 --> 01:26:34.460]  but seeing them
[01:26:34.460 --> 01:26:36.460]  I got some friends that have 800 gallon pots
[01:26:36.460 --> 01:26:38.460]  and they do 2 to 3 plants per pot
[01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:40.760]  but these plants
[01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:42.760]  have stalks that are that
[01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:44.760]  big, I mean they're
[01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:46.760]  8 inch bases
[01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:48.760]  what's going on up in Worth with the fires and the growers up there
[01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:50.760]  fires and growers, guys you got any news
[01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:52.760]  on that because I feel like
[01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:54.760]  it's been kind of screwed up
[01:26:54.760 --> 01:26:56.760]  we're lucky in the bay here
[01:26:56.760 --> 01:26:58.760]  I think some of my friends lost their growing
[01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:00.760]  yeah because Marlon was living in Grass Valley
[01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:02.760]  until just recently right
[01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:04.760]  2 or 3 days before
[01:27:04.760 --> 01:27:06.760]  that fire
[01:27:07.060 --> 01:27:09.060]  I was actually on my way back to the house
[01:27:09.060 --> 01:27:11.060]  to get some important stuff
[01:27:11.060 --> 01:27:13.060]  and fire blazed out
[01:27:13.060 --> 01:27:15.060]  I had to go to a hotel
[01:27:15.060 --> 01:27:17.060]  but I ended up staying by some
[01:27:17.060 --> 01:27:19.060]  other friends on a farm
[01:27:19.060 --> 01:27:21.060]  my last trip to Seattle
[01:27:21.060 --> 01:27:23.060]  one of the reasons I stopped it was because
[01:27:23.060 --> 01:27:25.060]  there were fires on the way that were
[01:27:25.060 --> 01:27:27.060]  adding hours to the drive
[01:27:27.060 --> 01:27:29.060]  well literally Marlon just had
[01:27:29.060 --> 01:27:31.060]  to go around barricades to get to
[01:27:31.060 --> 01:27:33.060]  his property up in Grass Valley
[01:27:33.060 --> 01:27:35.060]  I kind of know that
[01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:37.360]  my friends called me and said hey you can pass
[01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:39.360]  here and here and get to your house
[01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:41.360]  I'm at my house right now so
[01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:43.360]  I just followed what they told me to do
[01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:45.360]  I got to my house, it was still there luckily
[01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:47.360]  thought it was burned down because
[01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:49.360]  the fire map showed
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:51.360]  that fire was all over the house
[01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:53.360]  but it was really
[01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:55.360]  the neighbors
[01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:57.360]  and you know my
[01:27:57.360 --> 01:27:59.360]  they lost everything man, when I was driving up there
[01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:01.360]  I couldn't recognize where I'm at because
[01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:03.360]  it's burnt out
[01:28:03.660 --> 01:28:05.660]  houses gone
[01:28:05.660 --> 01:28:07.660]  there was no vegetation
[01:28:07.660 --> 01:28:09.660]  just the burned stumps of stuff
[01:28:09.660 --> 01:28:11.660]  fallen poles
[01:28:11.660 --> 01:28:13.660]  so I know a few farmers up there
[01:28:13.660 --> 01:28:15.660]  that lost their crop
[01:28:15.660 --> 01:28:17.660]  that's their years
[01:28:17.660 --> 01:28:19.660]  about a year salary from
[01:28:19.660 --> 01:28:21.660]  so yeah it's really sad
[01:28:21.660 --> 01:28:23.660]  neighbors properties burned
[01:28:23.660 --> 01:28:25.660]  yeah NorCal's
[01:28:25.660 --> 01:28:27.660]  been pretty crazy I mean we're blessed in the
[01:28:27.660 --> 01:28:29.660]  Bay Area and you know I was up in Seattle
[01:28:29.660 --> 01:28:31.660]  and it was like perfect weather, perfect 80 degrees
[01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:33.960]  all the time when we were up there
[01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:35.960]  much less grass value
[01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:37.960]  yeah I think someone asked if I'm
[01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:39.960]  working or anyone's working in Michigan
[01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:41.960]  are you guys working in Michigan? I got some
[01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:43.960]  projects that I've been
[01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:45.960]  talking to people about, I'm doing a bunch
[01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:47.960]  of collaboration projects all over
[01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:49.960]  I think three or four different states
[01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:51.960]  right now, three locked in and then another one
[01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:53.960]  potentially you know
[01:28:53.960 --> 01:28:55.960]  my buddy Mosca
[01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:57.960]  Negra, Rick from Mosca
[01:28:57.960 --> 01:28:59.960]  we've been talking about stuff, he'll be on
[01:29:00.260 --> 01:29:02.260]  my show again soon in the near future
[01:29:04.260 --> 01:29:06.260]  let's see
[01:29:06.260 --> 01:29:11.580]  man I'm not high anymore
[01:29:11.580 --> 01:29:13.580]  I need to smoke more
[01:29:13.580 --> 01:29:15.580]  I'm not high anymore
[01:29:15.580 --> 01:29:17.580]  sorry I've just been
[01:29:17.580 --> 01:29:19.580]  you know
[01:29:19.580 --> 01:29:21.580]  this little
[01:29:21.580 --> 01:29:23.580]  too puffy, gotta dab some
[01:29:23.580 --> 01:29:25.580]  what are you guys smoking on at home?
[01:29:25.580 --> 01:29:27.580]  let me see
[01:29:27.580 --> 01:29:31.420]  this is
[01:29:31.420 --> 01:29:33.420]  this is so tasty
[01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:35.720]  game changer
[01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:37.720]  oh yeah
[01:29:39.720 --> 01:29:41.720]  Marlon's bringing the sugar
[01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:43.720]  straight sugar
[01:29:49.720 --> 01:29:51.720]  super fire, yeah we got
[01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:53.720]  dab rigs, bongs, everything going
[01:29:53.720 --> 01:29:55.720]  it's Sunday
[01:29:55.720 --> 01:29:57.720]  I hope you guys are all smoking
[01:29:57.720 --> 01:29:59.720]  because I mean
[01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:01.720]  it's not all about
[01:30:02.020 --> 01:30:04.020]  work all the time, you guys gotta remember
[01:30:04.020 --> 01:30:06.020]  enjoy yourself
[01:30:06.020 --> 01:30:08.020]  figure out what makes you happy and do that
[01:30:08.020 --> 01:30:10.020]  if work makes you happy I guess just work all the time
[01:30:10.020 --> 01:30:12.020]  that works, Basio Gelato
[01:30:12.020 --> 01:30:14.020]  yeah that's Gelato 41
[01:30:14.020 --> 01:30:16.020]  that shit is fire
[01:30:16.020 --> 01:30:18.020]  and you know the whole Loud Ketogenics line was based on that
[01:30:18.020 --> 01:30:20.020]  Basio, Hayes and Jack
[01:30:20.020 --> 01:30:22.020]  original Hayes
[01:30:22.020 --> 01:30:24.020]  oh my god don't say Hayes man
[01:30:24.020 --> 01:30:26.020]  I don't know if you guys have tried Hayes
[01:30:26.020 --> 01:30:28.020]  I don't know where we got everyone watching it from
[01:30:28.020 --> 01:30:30.020]  but fuck the Hayes over
[01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:32.320]  in the Netherlands and over in Europe dude
[01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:34.320]  it's strong
[01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:36.320]  it will fuck your whole day
[01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:38.320]  your whole day is messed up bro
[01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:40.320]  you smoke some of that Hayes
[01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:42.320]  we're talking about hard politics
[01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:44.320]  I was
[01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:46.320]  I went downstairs
[01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:48.320]  to a coffee shop from my hotel
[01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:50.320]  and I got a bunch of Hayes
[01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:52.320]  amnesia Hayes
[01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:54.320]  I go back up to the room
[01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:56.320]  and I smoke one
[01:30:56.320 --> 01:30:58.320]  and then I
[01:30:58.620 --> 01:31:00.620]  for some reason the fire alarm went off
[01:31:00.620 --> 01:31:02.620]  in the building man I panicked
[01:31:02.620 --> 01:31:04.620]  threw all my weed outside the window
[01:31:04.620 --> 01:31:06.620]  man the most panic attack
[01:31:06.620 --> 01:31:08.620]  I had in my life
[01:31:08.620 --> 01:31:10.620]  you got all your
[01:31:10.620 --> 01:31:12.620]  bro I got rid of all my weed I look out the window
[01:31:12.620 --> 01:31:14.620]  I see some kids picking up the thing
[01:31:14.620 --> 01:31:16.620]  and I've been running off with that
[01:31:16.620 --> 01:31:18.620]  it got some good weed off of me
[01:31:18.620 --> 01:31:20.620]  but I was paranoid
[01:31:20.620 --> 01:31:22.620]  in that room for a good while
[01:31:22.620 --> 01:31:24.620]  I say uh uh no more Hayes for me man
[01:31:24.620 --> 01:31:26.620]  no I mean good Hayes
[01:31:26.920 --> 01:31:28.920]  I've gotten cotton mouth from Hayes
[01:31:28.920 --> 01:31:30.920]  where I can't even cure it by drinking
[01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:32.920]  a half gallon of water
[01:31:32.920 --> 01:31:34.920]  purple Hayes
[01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:36.920]  old school purple Hayes
[01:31:36.920 --> 01:31:38.920]  that shit is fire too
[01:31:38.920 --> 01:31:40.920]  it's funny how
[01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:42.920]  the purple strains made a comeback guys
[01:31:42.920 --> 01:31:44.920]  we had years where it was all about
[01:31:44.920 --> 01:31:46.920]  OG and chems and sours
[01:31:46.920 --> 01:31:48.920]  I love those years though
[01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:50.920]  and then cookies came around and cookies kind of changed that
[01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:52.920]  I think
[01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:54.920]  it's been around from before that
[01:31:55.220 --> 01:31:57.220]  2012 it started really having an impact
[01:31:57.220 --> 01:31:59.220]  on everybody
[01:31:59.220 --> 01:32:01.220]  and that you know
[01:32:01.220 --> 01:32:03.220]  it started there and then gelatos
[01:32:03.220 --> 01:32:05.220]  now it's like a requirement
[01:32:05.220 --> 01:32:07.220]  for your variety to be considered
[01:32:07.220 --> 01:32:12.220]  exotic
[01:32:12.220 --> 01:32:14.220]  no more Hayes
[01:32:14.220 --> 01:32:16.220]  Arian is
[01:32:16.220 --> 01:32:18.220]  the Hayes king his gear
[01:32:18.220 --> 01:32:20.220]  is legit if you can get the seeds
[01:32:20.220 --> 01:32:22.220]  to pop
[01:32:22.220 --> 01:32:24.220]  I think greenhouse seeds
[01:32:24.220 --> 01:32:26.220]  I've never had a problem with greenhouse seeds germinating
[01:32:26.520 --> 01:32:28.520]  maybe they had some problems at some point
[01:32:28.520 --> 01:32:30.520]  but shit
[01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:32.520]  they've done a lot of work
[01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:34.520]  they've done some interesting stuff
[01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:36.520]  they have some real good staples
[01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:38.520]  if people are having problems germinating seeds
[01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:40.520]  that's at Ron's
[01:32:40.520 --> 01:32:42.520]  that was
[01:32:42.520 --> 01:32:44.520]  fire
[01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:46.520]  what were you saying about germinating seeds
[01:32:46.520 --> 01:32:48.520]  no no
[01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:50.520]  if people are wondering
[01:32:50.520 --> 01:32:52.520]  do I have tips
[01:32:52.520 --> 01:32:54.520]  if you're having problems
[01:32:54.820 --> 01:32:56.820]  I'm just trying to bring up
[01:32:56.820 --> 01:32:58.820]  embryo rescue
[01:32:58.820 --> 01:33:00.820]  people have been
[01:33:00.820 --> 01:33:02.820]  doing it
[01:33:02.820 --> 01:33:04.820]  at least
[01:33:04.820 --> 01:33:06.820]  for a while now
[01:33:06.820 --> 01:33:08.820]  but if people are
[01:33:08.820 --> 01:33:10.820]  rescuing 20, 25 year old
[01:33:10.820 --> 01:33:12.820]  30 year old
[01:33:12.820 --> 01:33:14.820]  genetics by
[01:33:14.820 --> 01:33:16.820]  bleaching, sterilizing the seed
[01:33:16.820 --> 01:33:18.820]  cracking everything in vitro
[01:33:18.820 --> 01:33:20.820]  and taking that little embryo out
[01:33:20.820 --> 01:33:22.820]  and putting it on a recovery
[01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:25.120]  it's been really interesting
[01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:27.120]  with the media
[01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:29.120]  hormones and stuff
[01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:31.120]  it's been really interesting
[01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:33.120]  because you're able to go back in time
[01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:35.120]  there have been all these events
[01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:37.120]  you talked about cookies in 12
[01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:39.120]  you're able to go back in time
[01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:41.120]  before things happened
[01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:43.120]  that were heavily bred in
[01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:45.120]  and selected for or against
[01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:47.120]  yeah, embryogenesis
[01:33:47.120 --> 01:33:49.120]  straight up might be
[01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:51.120]  it's fascinating
[01:33:51.420 --> 01:33:53.420]  because
[01:33:53.420 --> 01:33:55.420]  you can always go back and try to
[01:33:55.420 --> 01:33:57.420]  rescue things
[01:33:57.420 --> 01:33:59.420]  but we were talking earlier
[01:33:59.420 --> 01:34:01.420]  on the podcast
[01:34:01.420 --> 01:34:03.420]  about we've been reading for
[01:34:03.420 --> 01:34:05.420]  high THC and specific flavors
[01:34:05.420 --> 01:34:07.420]  but what have we been breeding out
[01:34:07.420 --> 01:34:09.420]  when we've been breeding for
[01:34:09.420 --> 01:34:11.420]  things
[01:34:11.420 --> 01:34:13.420]  what cannabinoids have we been
[01:34:13.420 --> 01:34:15.420]  most people aren't even that scientific
[01:34:15.420 --> 01:34:17.420]  to grasp that
[01:34:17.420 --> 01:34:19.420]  but we talk about flavors and feelings
[01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:21.720]  and head highs
[01:34:21.720 --> 01:34:23.720]  and we do talk about it
[01:34:23.720 --> 01:34:25.720]  but not in a way that we can
[01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:27.720]  go back and track
[01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:29.720]  unless someone has some
[01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:31.720]  Neville's Haze
[01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:33.720]  oh just more Haze
[01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:35.720]  you got people talking about Haze
[01:34:35.720 --> 01:34:37.720]  Haze is troubling
[01:34:37.720 --> 01:34:39.720]  we're not even looking at it pragmatically
[01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:41.720]  from a scientific perspective
[01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:43.720]  for the most part
[01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:45.720]  I think there's definitely big companies doing it
[01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:47.720]  I can name a handful of people that are really
[01:34:48.020 --> 01:34:50.020]  from a medical standpoint
[01:34:50.020 --> 01:34:52.020]  Dr. Dede Miri over in Israel
[01:34:52.020 --> 01:34:54.020]  those guys take that side of it very seriously
[01:34:54.020 --> 01:34:56.020]  but yeah
[01:34:56.020 --> 01:34:58.020]  there's a lot of stuff we could potentially be breeding out
[01:34:58.020 --> 01:35:00.020]  that could be lost along the way
[01:35:00.020 --> 01:35:02.020]  there's a lot of stuff maybe that was out there
[01:35:02.020 --> 01:35:04.020]  land race wise
[01:35:04.020 --> 01:35:06.020]  that's been convoluted
[01:35:06.020 --> 01:35:08.020]  that smells amazing
[01:35:08.020 --> 01:35:10.020]  Cherry West BX Seedsman
[01:35:10.020 --> 01:35:12.020]  Haze can also be
[01:35:12.020 --> 01:35:14.020]  Haze in general man
[01:35:14.020 --> 01:35:16.020]  it's an interesting variety
[01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:18.320]  life up if you're not used to smoking it
[01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:20.320]  but if you smoke it all the time
[01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:22.320]  it's just normal
[01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:24.320]  yep
[01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:26.320]  I remember Trainwreck being so
[01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:28.320]  strong but then we smoked
[01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:30.320]  it all the time and it wasn't
[01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:32.320]  Trainwreck was definitely a hit
[01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:34.320]  Green Crack was another one
[01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:36.320]  sometimes your body will adapt
[01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:38.320]  Green Crack you'd smoke it
[01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:40.320]  I grew it one time and I had pounds and pounds
[01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:42.320]  and pounds and pounds and that's all I had
[01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:44.320]  literally after the first week it didn't give me high
[01:35:44.620 --> 01:35:46.620]  anymore
[01:35:46.620 --> 01:35:48.620]  so then I ended up trying to trade
[01:35:48.620 --> 01:35:50.620]  and my friends would be like oh dude this is the strongest
[01:35:50.620 --> 01:35:52.620]  shit ever
[01:35:52.620 --> 01:35:54.620]  but I've taken a couple puffs and it's like
[01:35:54.620 --> 01:35:56.620]  I'd smoke whole joints to my head
[01:35:56.620 --> 01:35:58.620]  where my friends would be sharing joints because your tolerance builds up so high
[01:35:58.620 --> 01:36:00.620]  and it doesn't affect you anymore
[01:36:00.620 --> 01:36:02.620]  oh very
[01:36:02.620 --> 01:36:04.620]  so yeah that kind of dates me I guess
[01:36:04.620 --> 01:36:06.620]  you guys can probably figure out how old I am
[01:36:06.620 --> 01:36:08.620]  Trainwreck
[01:36:08.620 --> 01:36:10.620]  started smoking in 91
[01:36:10.620 --> 01:36:14.340]  where Green Crack
[01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:16.640]  got lost anyway
[01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:18.640]  Ace killer A5 Haze fuck dude
[01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:20.640]  that's the one and that's the pissy smelling one
[01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:22.640]  too it's not exactly like Capus
[01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:24.640]  but it's definitely
[01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:26.640]  almost any strain develops
[01:36:26.640 --> 01:36:28.640]  I would agree but there's stuff like OG's
[01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:30.640]  that's one reason we like OG's
[01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:32.640]  I can smoke OG in the morning, afternoon, and night
[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:34.640]  and it usually fucking gets me a head
[01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:36.640]  change at the very least
[01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:38.640]  I feel the effects
[01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:40.640]  the headband, the OG's, the sour diesels
[01:36:40.640 --> 01:36:42.640]  I like those for that reason
[01:36:42.940 --> 01:36:44.940]  Green Crack, your body adapts to it extremely fast
[01:36:44.940 --> 01:36:46.940]  to where you can smoke a whole joint
[01:36:46.940 --> 01:36:48.940]  of it and it won't get you high
[01:36:48.940 --> 01:36:50.940]  whereas it's like this creeping high
[01:36:50.940 --> 01:36:52.940]  when you first start smoking it
[01:36:52.940 --> 01:36:54.940]  you take a couple hits and then within
[01:36:54.940 --> 01:36:56.940]  a couple minutes you're like fuck
[01:36:56.940 --> 01:36:58.940]  I'm super super super high
[01:36:58.940 --> 01:37:00.940]  well that goes away and I mean
[01:37:00.940 --> 01:37:02.940]  maybe it has to do with your awareness to it as well
[01:37:02.940 --> 01:37:04.940]  and awareness to the effects of the cannabinoids
[01:37:04.940 --> 01:37:06.940]  I mean there's so many possibilities
[01:37:06.940 --> 01:37:12.200]  I feel like Green Crack
[01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:14.200]  was lacking oil to help
[01:37:14.500 --> 01:37:16.500]  it's funny
[01:37:16.500 --> 01:37:18.500]  Green Crack was one of those ones
[01:37:18.500 --> 01:37:20.500]  and my friends have some Green Crack crosses
[01:37:20.500 --> 01:37:22.500]  I haven't smoked real Green Crack in a long time
[01:37:22.500 --> 01:37:24.500]  but I've seen people like
[01:37:24.500 --> 01:37:26.500]  been so high they had to sit on the ground
[01:37:26.500 --> 01:37:28.500]  when we were freaking
[01:37:28.500 --> 01:37:30.500]  I was at a Giants
[01:37:30.500 --> 01:37:32.500]  parade after they won the World Series
[01:37:32.500 --> 01:37:34.500]  and my friend took a couple hits
[01:37:34.500 --> 01:37:36.500]  I'm like what are you doing?
[01:37:36.500 --> 01:37:38.500]  He's like dude I gotta sit down this stuff is too strong
[01:37:38.500 --> 01:37:40.500]  and this guy is like a hardcore smoker
[01:37:40.500 --> 01:37:42.500]  in fact he smokes way more than I do even still
[01:37:42.800 --> 01:37:44.800]  but it's funny how terpenes can affect people
[01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:46.800]  differently like that
[01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:48.800]  Soko Master Kush
[01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:50.800]  Yeah dude the old school Master Kush
[01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:52.800]  guys if you didn't experience it
[01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:54.800]  it was fire
[01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:56.800]  it had an interesting structure
[01:37:56.800 --> 01:37:58.800]  it grew like a little Christmas tree
[01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:00.800]  looking at
[01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:02.800]  like the calyx opened up
[01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:04.800]  and it would be you know you could trim it tight
[01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:06.800]  so it would look beautiful and it would have
[01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:08.800]  a very gassy amazing
[01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:10.800]  nose on it it'd wreck you
[01:38:11.100 --> 01:38:13.100]  it was beautiful but the structure was definitely different
[01:38:13.100 --> 01:38:15.100]  from a lot of the other stuff
[01:38:17.100 --> 01:38:19.100]  Hayes panic attack story
[01:38:19.100 --> 01:38:21.100]  throwing stuff out the window because you're so high
[01:38:21.100 --> 01:38:23.100]  I remember when Mojave gave me
[01:38:23.100 --> 01:38:25.100]  some flour and he was like Joe this is what we
[01:38:25.100 --> 01:38:27.100]  smelled like when you were a baby
[01:38:27.100 --> 01:38:29.100]  That's right
[01:38:29.100 --> 01:38:31.100]  He's talking about Mojave Richman
[01:38:31.100 --> 01:38:33.100]  good guy yeah
[01:38:33.100 --> 01:38:35.100]  His sage cross
[01:38:35.100 --> 01:38:37.100]  his sage cross is
[01:38:37.100 --> 01:38:39.100]  all fire he's the guy who created the sage
[01:38:39.400 --> 01:38:41.400]  OG Kush x Big Sur Holy
[01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:43.400]  Big Sur Holy is a Hayes
[01:38:43.400 --> 01:38:45.400]  variety that's super
[01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:47.400]  super stony
[01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:49.400]  and then you throw OG Kush on anything
[01:38:49.400 --> 01:38:51.400]  and it's going to become great
[01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:55.400]  so yeah
[01:38:55.400 --> 01:38:57.400]  Back in the day
[01:38:57.400 --> 01:38:59.400]  me and Judah used to have a crazy
[01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:01.400]  stream of Master Kush
[01:39:01.400 --> 01:39:03.400]  that used to be really nice back in the day
[01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:05.400]  I think the popularity
[01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:07.400]  of mimosa
[01:39:07.700 --> 01:39:09.700]  is putting orange in a lot of new strains
[01:39:09.700 --> 01:39:11.700]  I mean like
[01:39:11.700 --> 01:39:13.700]  Tropicana Cookies
[01:39:13.700 --> 01:39:15.700]  I feel like Tange had its day
[01:39:15.700 --> 01:39:17.700]  Big Up to DNA for Tange
[01:39:17.700 --> 01:39:19.700]  Tropicana Cookies
[01:39:19.700 --> 01:39:21.700]  that took over
[01:39:21.700 --> 01:39:23.700]  Post Cookies
[01:39:23.700 --> 01:39:25.700]  that's when people now started to realize
[01:39:25.700 --> 01:39:27.700]  different flavors
[01:39:27.700 --> 01:39:29.700]  I think orange is cool
[01:39:29.700 --> 01:39:31.700]  I think orange still has room for it
[01:39:31.700 --> 01:39:33.700]  I like the taste of orange
[01:39:33.700 --> 01:39:35.700]  I just don't like too much rind
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000]  I feel like a lot of Tange is kind of rindy
[01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000]  and it doesn't go so well
[01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000]  You're like I want zest not pith
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000]  I want layers
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000]  I want layers and I do love the zest
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000]  Dude
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000]  if you guys smoke Lemon Tree
[01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000]  Lemon Tree has that yellow lemon zest
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000]  that peel
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000]  where you just zest it
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000]  and then it's got that gas to back
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000]  Lemon Tree is a good one
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000]  we don't talk about it a lot
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000]  people don't grow it as much as they used to
[01:40:04.300 --> 01:40:06.300]  Lemon Tree was one of those first things
[01:40:06.300 --> 01:40:08.300]  that I started seeing really high THC
[01:40:08.300 --> 01:40:10.300]  in like
[01:40:10.300 --> 01:40:12.300]  16, 17
[01:40:12.300 --> 01:40:14.300]  Someone asked about Bodhi Seeds
[01:40:14.300 --> 01:40:16.300]  Thoughts on Bodhi
[01:40:16.300 --> 01:40:18.300]  Bodhi does some amazing
[01:40:18.300 --> 01:40:20.300]  work and I feel like he's basically
[01:40:20.300 --> 01:40:22.300]  gone around the world hunting seeds
[01:40:22.300 --> 01:40:24.300]  and he really
[01:40:24.300 --> 01:40:26.300]  put his
[01:40:26.300 --> 01:40:28.300]  he says he's not a breeder but he's as much
[01:40:28.300 --> 01:40:30.300]  of a breeder as 99%
[01:40:30.300 --> 01:40:32.300]  of the people
[01:40:32.600 --> 01:40:34.600]  or 100% of the people in my opinion
[01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:36.600]  some of his stuff, his mother's milk
[01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:38.600]  really good stuff
[01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:40.600]  and he kind of has his own style
[01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:42.600]  which I like, he's not trying to do
[01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:44.600]  everything, he's trying to produce
[01:40:44.600 --> 01:40:46.600]  good quality stuff and good quality stuff
[01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:48.600]  to share with the world
[01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:50.600]  so that's my thought on him if you guys have access to his stuff
[01:40:54.600 --> 01:40:58.450]  Orange Bud
[01:40:58.450 --> 01:41:00.450]  Orange Bud in the 90's
[01:41:00.450 --> 01:41:02.450]  It's so funny because in the 90's
[01:41:02.750 --> 01:41:04.750]  I remember, we did have straight names
[01:41:04.750 --> 01:41:06.750]  but a lot of times we'd be like, oh yeah this is Orange Bud
[01:41:06.750 --> 01:41:08.750]  because it was like more orange
[01:41:08.750 --> 01:41:10.750]  or we had, it was just Green Bud
[01:41:10.750 --> 01:41:12.750]  or we called it Dro or we called it Hydro
[01:41:12.750 --> 01:41:14.750]  Hydro Dro
[01:41:14.750 --> 01:41:16.750]  Back in the day
[01:41:16.750 --> 01:41:18.750]  things were a little bit different
[01:41:18.750 --> 01:41:20.750]  Some indoor strains
[01:41:20.750 --> 01:41:22.750]  that are heavy yielding
[01:41:22.750 --> 01:41:24.750]  Man, uh
[01:41:24.750 --> 01:41:26.750]  How good of a grower are you?
[01:41:26.750 --> 01:41:28.750]  No, I'm joking
[01:41:28.750 --> 01:41:30.750]  It's like, uh, there's so many ways
[01:41:31.050 --> 01:41:33.050]  You want a specific yield
[01:41:33.050 --> 01:41:35.050]  You can put more plants in, stuff like Skittles
[01:41:35.050 --> 01:41:37.050]  You gotta put, I used to do 16 plants per
[01:41:37.050 --> 01:41:39.050]  4x4
[01:41:39.050 --> 01:41:41.050]  which might seem like a lot but you would have to really thin them out
[01:41:41.050 --> 01:41:43.050]  and it wouldn't yield fantastic
[01:41:43.050 --> 01:41:45.050]  but it would yield better, I think
[01:41:45.050 --> 01:41:47.050]  Uh, Grease Monkey
[01:41:47.050 --> 01:41:49.050]  That's another good one
[01:41:49.050 --> 01:41:51.050]  You want something gassy
[01:41:51.050 --> 01:41:53.050]  What the fuck is, uh, Motor Breath 15
[01:41:53.050 --> 01:41:55.050]  is an interesting one
[01:41:55.050 --> 01:41:57.050]  We haven't been talking about Motor Breath quite as much
[01:41:57.050 --> 01:41:59.050]  I think California there's a lot of
[01:41:59.350 --> 01:42:01.350]  It's strong, James
[01:42:01.350 --> 01:42:03.350]  I agree with whoever said 24K
[01:42:03.350 --> 01:42:05.350]  was better than just Tangy
[01:42:05.350 --> 01:42:07.350]  24K is better than Tangy, for sure
[01:42:07.350 --> 01:42:09.350]  I think, the extract is really good
[01:42:09.350 --> 01:42:11.350]  I think
[01:42:11.350 --> 01:42:13.350]  you talked to Don
[01:42:13.350 --> 01:42:15.350]  I don't know personally
[01:42:15.350 --> 01:42:17.350]  but I'm guessing if we were to frickin'
[01:42:17.350 --> 01:42:19.350]  air it up right now, he would be like, yeah, sure
[01:42:19.350 --> 01:42:21.350]  it's better than Tangy
[01:42:21.350 --> 01:42:23.350]  Maybe not monetarily for him, dude, that fuckin' Tangy
[01:42:23.350 --> 01:42:25.350]  You know, that was a game changer
[01:42:25.350 --> 01:42:27.350]  That was as big as cookies
[01:42:27.650 --> 01:42:29.650]  I don't think people, you know, people still like cookies
[01:42:29.650 --> 01:42:31.650]  People have been hating on Tangy
[01:42:31.650 --> 01:42:33.650]  But Tangy, when it was winning all those
[01:42:33.650 --> 01:42:35.650]  It's probably the most awarded variety
[01:42:35.650 --> 01:42:37.650]  You know
[01:42:37.650 --> 01:42:39.650]  If it's not
[01:42:39.650 --> 01:42:41.650]  It's a top two or three
[01:42:41.650 --> 01:42:43.650]  Uh, yeah, Tangy
[01:42:43.650 --> 01:42:45.650]  Tangy also grows very well
[01:42:45.650 --> 01:42:47.650]  It does, it yields good
[01:42:47.650 --> 01:42:49.650]  Like, she, Tangy
[01:42:49.650 --> 01:42:51.650]  was one of all, like, Tangy was always
[01:42:51.650 --> 01:42:53.650]  worked really well in my tissue culture
[01:42:53.650 --> 01:42:55.650]  systems, she worked in
[01:42:55.950 --> 01:42:57.950]  where I'm like, Tangy and Tangy genetics
[01:42:57.950 --> 01:42:59.950]  did good in my systems, right?
[01:42:59.950 --> 01:43:01.950]  Yeah
[01:43:01.950 --> 01:43:03.950]  Sorry
[01:43:03.950 --> 01:43:08.440]  Sorry
[01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:10.440]  Um, what a good number
[01:43:10.440 --> 01:43:12.440]  I mean, honestly
[01:43:12.440 --> 01:43:14.440]  Do you get a good idea of what
[01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:16.440]  you're gonna find? I think 100 is what I like
[01:43:16.440 --> 01:43:18.440]  But dude, I have friends that
[01:43:18.440 --> 01:43:20.440]  hunt with 10 beans
[01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:22.440]  Um, you know, and you can find
[01:43:22.440 --> 01:43:24.440]  good stuff in 10, you can find
[01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:26.440]  good stuff in 100, but you might not find
[01:43:26.740 --> 01:43:28.740]  anything in 10, you might not find anything in 100
[01:43:28.740 --> 01:43:30.740]  So it's really about the quality of the seeds
[01:43:30.740 --> 01:43:32.740]  you're hunting
[01:43:32.740 --> 01:43:34.740]  and how many different varieties there are
[01:43:34.740 --> 01:43:36.740]  in there, because, you know, we're talking about these complex
[01:43:36.740 --> 01:43:38.740]  polyhybrids where you get a bunch of
[01:43:38.740 --> 01:43:40.740]  variation
[01:43:40.740 --> 01:43:42.740]  because there's so many different lines in it
[01:43:42.740 --> 01:43:44.740]  and it hasn't been bred stably
[01:43:44.740 --> 01:43:46.740]  to where it expresses
[01:43:46.740 --> 01:43:48.740]  less phenotypes and genotypes, so
[01:43:48.740 --> 01:43:50.740]  really, it's
[01:43:50.740 --> 01:43:52.740]  whose seeds are you buying? What are you
[01:43:52.740 --> 01:43:54.740]  buying? What are you looking for?
[01:43:55.040 --> 01:43:57.040]  And I think it depends on
[01:43:57.040 --> 01:43:59.040]  there's people like where I think
[01:43:59.040 --> 01:44:01.040]  it's, I want that 1%, but sometimes
[01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:03.040]  people are okay and they're super happy with that
[01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:05.040]  10%, that 1 in 10
[01:44:05.040 --> 01:44:07.040]  they'll find something good
[01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:09.040]  It depends on the quality, if you grow mediocre
[01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:11.040]  sometimes
[01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:13.040]  it won't matter, you know, it's like if you grow
[01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:15.040]  really, really well, that's when you start seeing
[01:44:15.040 --> 01:44:17.040]  unique differences, but some people
[01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:19.040]  I think are happy with that 1 in 10, they can find a
[01:44:19.040 --> 01:44:21.040]  keeper, uh, and
[01:44:21.040 --> 01:44:23.040]  then over in Europe, everybody just seems to go for
[01:44:23.340 --> 01:44:25.340]  a feminized seed
[01:44:25.340 --> 01:44:27.340]  so that's like the 1 in
[01:44:27.340 --> 01:44:29.340]  they're okay with buying 3 packs over there
[01:44:29.340 --> 01:44:31.340]  and you know, I mean it's
[01:44:31.340 --> 01:44:33.340]  And it also matters who you got your seed from
[01:44:33.340 --> 01:44:35.340]  I think a lot of people when they talk about
[01:44:35.340 --> 01:44:37.340]  like, how stable is
[01:44:37.340 --> 01:44:39.340]  this seed pack, I'm like, well who did you get it
[01:44:39.340 --> 01:44:41.340]  from? And you know, on top
[01:44:41.340 --> 01:44:43.340]  of like, what is the actual cross?
[01:44:43.340 --> 01:44:45.340]  Well, can you control the environment
[01:44:45.340 --> 01:44:47.340]  and the different variables in
[01:44:47.340 --> 01:44:49.340]  the drying and curing process?
[01:44:49.340 --> 01:44:51.340]  That's huge too, because if you can't even control
[01:44:51.640 --> 01:44:53.640]  those, you don't even worry about it
[01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:55.640]  pretty much everything is going to come out the same
[01:44:55.640 --> 01:44:57.640]  which is not good
[01:44:57.640 --> 01:44:59.640]  which is not where you want to be, I feel like
[01:44:59.640 --> 01:45:01.640]  those post-harvest
[01:45:01.640 --> 01:45:03.640]  SOPs need to come
[01:45:03.640 --> 01:45:05.640]  into play, I think following those
[01:45:05.640 --> 01:45:07.640]  and maintaining the proper
[01:45:07.640 --> 01:45:09.640]  humidity and temperature, I think
[01:45:09.640 --> 01:45:11.640]  um, let's see
[01:45:11.640 --> 01:45:13.640]  I'm going to even send it
[01:45:13.640 --> 01:45:15.640]  I'm going to send what I use
[01:45:15.640 --> 01:45:17.640]  to Peter so he can put it up on the screen
[01:45:17.640 --> 01:45:19.640]  but I think
[01:45:19.940 --> 01:45:21.940]  post-harvest is so
[01:45:21.940 --> 01:45:23.940]  important
[01:45:23.940 --> 01:45:25.940]  that if you're not doing that right, you're just
[01:45:25.940 --> 01:45:27.940]  you know, you're basically not going to
[01:45:27.940 --> 01:45:29.940]  get all the terpenes on the nose
[01:45:29.940 --> 01:45:31.940]  Oh, there's Peter, how's it going Peter?
[01:45:31.940 --> 01:45:33.940]  Joe Jitsu
[01:45:33.940 --> 01:45:35.940]  people still are like
[01:45:35.940 --> 01:45:37.940]  I'm still getting mixed yeses
[01:45:37.940 --> 01:45:39.940]  and no's, which is very confusing to me
[01:45:39.940 --> 01:45:41.940]  about whether or not hop weight and
[01:45:41.940 --> 01:45:43.940]  the seed transmittable
[01:45:43.940 --> 01:45:45.940]  um, the test that I did
[01:45:45.940 --> 01:45:47.940]  now, that I'm like, oh
[01:45:48.240 --> 01:45:50.240]  I think maybe it is
[01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:52.240]  maybe there are other things going on in that specific
[01:45:52.240 --> 01:45:54.240]  group, other people have said no
[01:45:54.240 --> 01:45:56.240]  like they've popped 100 seed
[01:45:56.240 --> 01:45:58.240]  from a sick mom, tested 25
[01:45:58.240 --> 01:46:00.240]  and gotten a negative
[01:46:00.240 --> 01:46:02.240]  this is from Oli Bektos
[01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:04.240]  at Purple City Genetics
[01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:06.240]  so it's like
[01:46:06.240 --> 01:46:08.240]  is it yes, is it no? I think
[01:46:08.240 --> 01:46:10.240]  we're
[01:46:10.240 --> 01:46:12.240]  kind of still out
[01:46:12.240 --> 01:46:14.240]  on it
[01:46:14.240 --> 01:46:16.240]  yeah
[01:46:16.540 --> 01:46:18.540]  I'm
[01:46:18.540 --> 01:46:20.540]  with the move from San Diego
[01:46:20.540 --> 01:46:22.540]  to Sacramento, I need to
[01:46:22.540 --> 01:46:24.540]  put some of my own R&D on pause
[01:46:24.540 --> 01:46:26.540]  that I'm paying up literally right now
[01:46:26.540 --> 01:46:28.540]  so yeah
[01:46:28.540 --> 01:46:30.540]  give me a couple more months and I'll have like a more solid
[01:46:30.540 --> 01:46:32.540]  public statement
[01:46:32.540 --> 01:46:34.540]  that I'll be able to put on
[01:46:34.540 --> 01:46:36.540]  something very official like an Instagram
[01:46:36.540 --> 01:46:38.540]  post or something, I don't know
[01:46:38.540 --> 01:46:40.540]  no, no, so these are the kinds of things that are
[01:46:40.540 --> 01:46:42.540]  presented at these research conferences that are cancelled
[01:46:42.540 --> 01:46:44.540]  so yeah
[01:46:44.840 --> 01:46:46.840]  what are you hopping over from? Cannabis
[01:46:46.840 --> 01:46:48.840]  Hop Stunt Viroid
[01:46:48.840 --> 01:46:50.840]  has been like identified
[01:46:50.840 --> 01:46:52.840]  at one of these research conferences
[01:46:52.840 --> 01:46:54.840]  in Oregon so
[01:46:54.840 --> 01:46:56.840]  that's why me and a lot of other people
[01:46:56.840 --> 01:46:58.840]  have been testing for it
[01:46:58.840 --> 01:47:00.840]  a big deal with right now
[01:47:00.840 --> 01:47:02.840]  is Hopling Viroid was just
[01:47:02.840 --> 01:47:04.840]  this first viral disease that got
[01:47:04.840 --> 01:47:06.840]  kind of like
[01:47:06.840 --> 01:47:08.840]  started causing very large scale
[01:47:08.840 --> 01:47:10.840]  problems but there's other stuff
[01:47:10.840 --> 01:47:12.840]  happening and there will in the future
[01:47:13.140 --> 01:47:15.140]  continue to be more problems
[01:47:15.140 --> 01:47:17.140]  so you need to kind of know
[01:47:17.140 --> 01:47:19.140]  what's going on
[01:47:19.140 --> 01:47:21.140]  and what's out there
[01:47:21.140 --> 01:47:23.140]  so there's people that are actively
[01:47:23.140 --> 01:47:25.140]  testing for these things that are known to be spreading around
[01:47:25.140 --> 01:47:27.140]  Lettuce Chlorosis Virus was published
[01:47:27.140 --> 01:47:29.140]  out of Israel
[01:47:29.140 --> 01:47:31.140]  Beet Curly Top in Colorado
[01:47:31.140 --> 01:47:33.140]  Hopling Viroid in California
[01:47:33.140 --> 01:47:35.140]  and
[01:47:35.140 --> 01:47:37.140]  so people have these panels
[01:47:37.140 --> 01:47:39.140]  so it's not even just like one negative
[01:47:39.140 --> 01:47:41.140]  test is even enough, you want
[01:47:41.440 --> 01:47:43.440]  to test for like a panel of multiple things
[01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:45.440]  but since every test costs
[01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:47.440]  money, it's too
[01:47:47.440 --> 01:47:49.440]  expensive to just test everything
[01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:51.440]  for everything so you have to
[01:47:51.440 --> 01:47:53.440]  work with groups of people and kind
[01:47:53.440 --> 01:47:55.440]  of work with clean stock and
[01:47:55.440 --> 01:47:57.440]  do things that you can make sure
[01:47:57.440 --> 01:47:59.440]  it's insured to continue
[01:47:59.440 --> 01:48:01.440]  to be clean from different parts of
[01:48:01.440 --> 01:48:03.440]  the chain of custody
[01:48:03.440 --> 01:48:05.440]  and it's up to like universities
[01:48:05.440 --> 01:48:07.440]  and companies to do research
[01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:09.440]  about what are the new emergent
[01:48:09.740 --> 01:48:11.740]  diseases actively hopping in
[01:48:11.740 --> 01:48:13.740]  and yeah, so that's what
[01:48:13.740 --> 01:48:15.740]  we are actively doing so a lot of people
[01:48:15.740 --> 01:48:17.740]  are still investing in these things called
[01:48:17.740 --> 01:48:19.740]  one of these
[01:48:19.740 --> 01:48:21.740]  approaches called RNA-Seq which is
[01:48:21.740 --> 01:48:23.740]  you know, taking samples of these plants
[01:48:23.740 --> 01:48:25.740]  that have problems and negative
[01:48:25.740 --> 01:48:27.740]  for Hopling Viroid
[01:48:27.740 --> 01:48:29.740]  I have these like sick plant libraries
[01:48:29.740 --> 01:48:31.740]  that you know, we're working
[01:48:31.740 --> 01:48:33.740]  with these research
[01:48:33.740 --> 01:48:35.740]  companies to kind of hunt for these new viruses
[01:48:35.740 --> 01:48:37.740]  we publicize the things we find
[01:48:38.040 --> 01:48:40.040]  and that's just how the industry works
[01:48:40.040 --> 01:48:42.040]  like we
[01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:44.040]  have to report these kinds of things to
[01:48:44.040 --> 01:48:46.040]  our state regulatory agencies like
[01:48:46.040 --> 01:48:48.040]  in me in California it's the CDFA
[01:48:48.040 --> 01:48:50.040]  California Department of Food and Agriculture
[01:48:50.040 --> 01:48:52.040]  and these are the agencies
[01:48:52.040 --> 01:48:54.040]  that like, yeah, just make sure that
[01:48:54.040 --> 01:48:56.040]  the crop is safe to
[01:48:56.040 --> 01:48:58.040]  be working with and these are the kinds of
[01:48:58.040 --> 01:49:00.040]  regulations that are just you know
[01:49:00.040 --> 01:49:02.040]  it's involved in like when you ship export
[01:49:02.040 --> 01:49:04.040]  plants internationally
[01:49:04.040 --> 01:49:06.040]  these are the laws that people have to follow
[01:49:06.340 --> 01:49:08.340]  so yeah
[01:49:08.340 --> 01:49:10.340]  So Peter, did you get that text I just sent you with the
[01:49:10.340 --> 01:49:12.340]  drying setup?
[01:49:12.340 --> 01:49:14.340]  Basically
[01:49:14.340 --> 01:49:16.340]  my recommendation is that I actually got
[01:49:16.340 --> 01:49:18.340]  from my buddy Jason, House of Cultivar
[01:49:18.340 --> 01:49:20.340]  up north and once I switched over
[01:49:20.340 --> 01:49:22.340]  to that method where you
[01:49:22.340 --> 01:49:24.340]  start at 55 for 3-4 days
[01:49:26.340 --> 01:49:28.340]  I think is the best for
[01:49:28.340 --> 01:49:30.340]  preserving turps
[01:49:30.340 --> 01:49:32.340]  so
[01:49:32.340 --> 01:49:34.340]  Chase said something, cannabis
[01:49:34.640 --> 01:49:36.640]  is ahead and behind the rest of agriculture
[01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:38.640]  at the same time. For sure. Exactly
[01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:40.640]  It's well put. Of course, still
[01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:42.640]  fucking illegal
[01:49:42.640 --> 01:49:44.640]  I mean, dude
[01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:46.640]  it's crazy
[01:49:46.640 --> 01:49:48.640]  guys, but these things are changing
[01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:50.640]  they're changing hopefully
[01:49:50.640 --> 01:49:52.640]  for the better
[01:49:58.640 --> 01:50:00.640]  Yeah, like biodiversity is one of the things that cannabis
[01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:02.640]  is kind of like a strength
[01:50:02.940 --> 01:50:04.940]  that we have over a lot
[01:50:04.940 --> 01:50:06.940]  it's also a weakness
[01:50:06.940 --> 01:50:08.940]  versus like
[01:50:08.940 --> 01:50:10.940]  some crops where there's only like 4 or 5 production
[01:50:10.940 --> 01:50:12.940]  cultivars
[01:50:12.940 --> 01:50:14.940]  but you know, one of the reasons I love this thing
[01:50:14.940 --> 01:50:16.940]  right?
[01:50:16.940 --> 01:50:18.940]  It's amazing
[01:50:18.940 --> 01:50:20.940]  Okay guys, we're going to read this to you
[01:50:20.940 --> 01:50:22.940]  Ideally, drying room is 55%
[01:50:22.940 --> 01:50:24.940]  for about 3-4 days
[01:50:24.940 --> 01:50:26.940]  60% for another 6 days
[01:50:26.940 --> 01:50:28.940]  62-65% for the last
[01:50:28.940 --> 01:50:30.940]  3-4 days
[01:50:31.240 --> 01:50:33.240]  60 degrees the whole time
[01:50:33.240 --> 01:50:35.240]  and then your storage room which is separate from your drying room
[01:50:35.240 --> 01:50:37.240]  is kept at 65% 60 degrees
[01:50:37.240 --> 01:50:39.240]  this is a game changer
[01:50:39.240 --> 01:50:41.240]  I mean, I used to get
[01:50:41.240 --> 01:50:43.240]  lucky
[01:50:43.240 --> 01:50:45.240]  and maintain it
[01:50:45.240 --> 01:50:47.240]  I would do 60% the whole time
[01:50:47.240 --> 01:50:49.240]  I've done all kinds of different stuff
[01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:51.240]  but I feel like
[01:50:51.240 --> 01:50:53.240]  this right here is solid
[01:50:53.240 --> 01:50:55.240]  if you guys are looking at
[01:50:55.240 --> 01:50:57.240]  how do I preserve the most turps
[01:50:57.240 --> 01:50:59.240]  with my phenohunt
[01:50:59.540 --> 01:51:01.540]  it's straight forward
[01:51:03.540 --> 01:51:05.540]  yeah
[01:51:05.540 --> 01:51:07.540]  so, let's see if we got any
[01:51:07.540 --> 01:51:09.540]  who's got some questions for Marlon?
[01:51:09.540 --> 01:51:11.540]  Ganja Farmer questions guys
[01:51:11.540 --> 01:51:13.540]  someone yielded fat
[01:51:13.540 --> 01:51:15.540]  off the Ganja Farmer
[01:51:15.540 --> 01:51:17.540]  Kush Auto, 4.5 ounces
[01:51:17.540 --> 01:51:19.540]  dude, did you send pictures?
[01:51:19.540 --> 01:51:21.540]  maybe we'll send you some seeds
[01:51:21.540 --> 01:51:23.540]  I don't know
[01:51:23.540 --> 01:51:25.540]  4.5 ounces off of one plant
[01:51:25.540 --> 01:51:27.540]  you get a high five for that
[01:51:27.840 --> 01:51:29.840]  I would love to see the photos of it
[01:51:29.840 --> 01:51:31.840]  those are great results
[01:51:31.840 --> 01:51:33.840]  that must be under 20 hours light
[01:51:33.840 --> 01:51:35.840]  that means they are active and growing
[01:51:35.840 --> 01:51:37.840]  20 hours light indoors would probably be my guess
[01:51:37.840 --> 01:51:39.840]  which is what I do
[01:51:39.840 --> 01:51:41.840]  for the seed production
[01:51:41.840 --> 01:51:43.840]  what is the best Jamaican landrace?
[01:51:43.840 --> 01:51:45.840]  that's a great question Marlon
[01:51:45.840 --> 01:51:47.840]  it's a great question for Marlon
[01:51:47.840 --> 01:51:49.840]  what's the best Jamaican?
[01:51:49.840 --> 01:51:51.840]  landrace, landrace strain
[01:51:51.840 --> 01:51:53.840]  landrace strain?
[01:51:53.840 --> 01:51:55.840]  we can debate whether
[01:51:56.140 --> 01:51:58.140]  let's just talk about the different ones
[01:51:58.140 --> 01:52:00.140]  there's lamb's bread
[01:52:00.140 --> 01:52:02.140]  there's lamb's bread
[01:52:02.140 --> 01:52:04.140]  that's a landrace
[01:52:04.140 --> 01:52:06.140]  and what about
[01:52:06.140 --> 01:52:08.140]  Orange Hill?
[01:52:08.140 --> 01:52:10.140]  yeah, up Orange Hill
[01:52:10.140 --> 01:52:12.140]  Orange Hill is the one
[01:52:12.140 --> 01:52:14.140]  that's a strain we would love
[01:52:14.140 --> 01:52:16.140]  I got seeds
[01:52:16.140 --> 01:52:18.140]  in fact a guy just sent me seeds
[01:52:18.140 --> 01:52:20.140]  Orange Hill has their own
[01:52:20.140 --> 01:52:22.140]  you know
[01:52:22.140 --> 01:52:24.140]  strain and it's been there
[01:52:24.440 --> 01:52:26.440]  for ages
[01:52:26.440 --> 01:52:28.440]  and every time you go to Jamaica
[01:52:28.440 --> 01:52:30.440]  if you ever get a split from up there
[01:52:30.440 --> 01:52:32.440]  you can actually taste the difference
[01:52:32.440 --> 01:52:34.440]  that's something
[01:52:34.440 --> 01:52:36.440]  we would like to work with
[01:52:36.440 --> 01:52:38.440]  and in St. Vincent
[01:52:38.440 --> 01:52:40.440]  they got a landrace strain too
[01:52:40.440 --> 01:52:42.440]  you know
[01:52:42.440 --> 01:52:44.440]  it's called
[01:52:44.440 --> 01:52:46.440]  St. Vincent Gold or something like that
[01:52:46.440 --> 01:52:48.440]  but I can't remember the right name
[01:52:48.440 --> 01:52:50.440]  but back in the days in Trinidad
[01:52:50.440 --> 01:52:52.440]  when it came to Trinidad
[01:52:52.740 --> 01:52:54.740]  you know get it and
[01:52:54.740 --> 01:52:56.740]  you would know the difference
[01:52:56.740 --> 01:52:58.740]  from other strains
[01:52:58.740 --> 01:53:00.740]  and even Santa Marta
[01:53:00.740 --> 01:53:02.740]  you know what I'm saying?
[01:53:02.740 --> 01:53:04.740]  yeah totally, Santa Marta, that's Colombian
[01:53:04.740 --> 01:53:06.740]  that's the famous Colombian strain
[01:53:06.740 --> 01:53:08.740]  that's just a landrace strain
[01:53:08.740 --> 01:53:10.740]  dude but that Orange Hill
[01:53:10.740 --> 01:53:12.740]  if you guys ever are in Jamaica
[01:53:12.740 --> 01:53:14.740]  go seek out the Orange Hill
[01:53:14.740 --> 01:53:16.740]  that shit will change your life
[01:53:16.740 --> 01:53:18.740]  I mean I was so high
[01:53:18.740 --> 01:53:20.740]  it knocked me out
[01:53:21.040 --> 01:53:23.040]  so I was there on my honeymoon in 2000
[01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:25.040]  and we were at the hotel
[01:53:25.040 --> 01:53:27.040]  and I kept giving the guy
[01:53:27.040 --> 01:53:29.040]  $20 a day to bring me different weed
[01:53:29.040 --> 01:53:31.040]  I told him give me the best
[01:53:31.040 --> 01:53:33.040]  and he kept bringing stuff that was mediocre
[01:53:33.040 --> 01:53:35.040]  dude it looked like sticks
[01:53:35.040 --> 01:53:37.040]  and it was just really bad
[01:53:37.040 --> 01:53:39.040]  finally I brought Alex to Jamaica
[01:53:39.040 --> 01:53:41.040]  I brought some weed
[01:53:41.040 --> 01:53:43.040]  and I gave him a nugget
[01:53:43.040 --> 01:53:45.040]  told him to
[01:53:45.040 --> 01:53:47.040]  go to the guy where he gets the flower from
[01:53:47.040 --> 01:53:49.040]  and give it to him
[01:53:49.340 --> 01:53:51.340]  and tell him I want the best
[01:53:51.340 --> 01:53:53.340]  I want the best buds you can find
[01:53:53.340 --> 01:53:55.340]  so he came back the next day
[01:53:55.340 --> 01:53:57.340]  with two spliffs rolled up
[01:53:57.340 --> 01:53:59.340]  and it was probably like 9 in the morning
[01:53:59.340 --> 01:54:01.340]  and this guy was stalking our hotel
[01:54:01.340 --> 01:54:03.340]  with red stripe beer
[01:54:03.340 --> 01:54:05.340]  and everything and brought these two joints
[01:54:05.340 --> 01:54:07.340]  and smoked a half a joint
[01:54:07.340 --> 01:54:09.340]  and passed out and woke up at like
[01:54:09.340 --> 01:54:11.340]  4.30 in the afternoon
[01:54:11.340 --> 01:54:13.340]  like what the fuck just happened
[01:54:13.340 --> 01:54:15.340]  stuff was so strong
[01:54:15.340 --> 01:54:17.340]  and it's potent and it's hashy tasting
[01:54:17.640 --> 01:54:19.640]  that's the best part of it
[01:54:19.640 --> 01:54:21.640]  the hashy taste
[01:54:21.640 --> 01:54:23.640]  that you don't have to really smoke hashy
[01:54:23.640 --> 01:54:25.640]  it's just hashy
[01:54:25.640 --> 01:54:27.640]  it's like musky and hashy
[01:54:27.640 --> 01:54:29.640]  and it changed your life
[01:54:29.640 --> 01:54:31.640]  yeah my eyes
[01:54:31.640 --> 01:54:33.640]  I don't know if it was my eyes that was red
[01:54:33.640 --> 01:54:35.640]  to the point that
[01:54:35.640 --> 01:54:37.640]  the whole day
[01:54:37.640 --> 01:54:39.640]  all the clouds, sun rays
[01:54:39.640 --> 01:54:41.640]  everything was looking red
[01:54:41.640 --> 01:54:43.640]  so I was high for like hours
[01:54:43.640 --> 01:54:45.640]  and yo
[01:54:45.940 --> 01:54:47.940]  this is one of the best
[01:54:47.940 --> 01:54:49.940]  strains I've smoked
[01:54:49.940 --> 01:54:51.940]  in my time
[01:54:51.940 --> 01:54:53.940]  there's a lot of
[01:54:53.940 --> 01:54:55.940]  when I went to Africa
[01:54:57.940 --> 01:54:59.940]  the Malawi gold
[01:54:59.940 --> 01:55:01.940]  I think it's
[01:55:01.940 --> 01:55:03.940]  Malawi gold
[01:55:03.940 --> 01:55:05.940]  the hot one
[01:55:05.940 --> 01:55:07.940]  you know
[01:55:07.940 --> 01:55:09.940]  it's so dark
[01:55:09.940 --> 01:55:11.940]  it looks black
[01:55:11.940 --> 01:55:13.940]  that was one of the THC V
[01:55:14.240 --> 01:55:16.240]  varieties and that stuff is potent
[01:55:16.240 --> 01:55:18.240]  it's potent in edibles too
[01:55:18.240 --> 01:55:20.240]  the edibles come out super strong
[01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:22.240]  from that stuff
[01:55:22.240 --> 01:55:24.240]  yeah I'm a big fan
[01:55:24.240 --> 01:55:26.240]  of you know we smoked
[01:55:26.240 --> 01:55:28.240]  on the show we smoked some red congolese
[01:55:28.240 --> 01:55:30.240]  before and we've smoked Durban
[01:55:30.240 --> 01:55:32.240]  lots of Durban I like Durban
[01:55:32.240 --> 01:55:34.240]  a lot of the
[01:55:34.240 --> 01:55:36.240]  traditional or older
[01:55:36.240 --> 01:55:38.240]  land races I've worked with
[01:55:38.240 --> 01:55:40.240]  some of the things they're not as like heavy
[01:55:40.240 --> 01:55:42.240]  yielders
[01:55:42.540 --> 01:55:44.540]  and they're not too heavy
[01:55:44.540 --> 01:55:46.540]  with THC either
[01:55:46.540 --> 01:55:48.540]  yeah so I mean
[01:55:48.540 --> 01:55:50.540]  it's like it's up to
[01:55:50.540 --> 01:55:52.540]  breeders to work with them a lot of
[01:55:52.540 --> 01:55:54.540]  production people are like a run of that
[01:55:54.540 --> 01:55:56.540]  versus X
[01:55:56.540 --> 01:55:58.540]  you know and it's hard
[01:55:58.540 --> 01:56:00.540]  it's hard
[01:56:00.540 --> 01:56:02.540]  part of the problem with some of these varieties is
[01:56:02.540 --> 01:56:04.540]  flowering time
[01:56:04.540 --> 01:56:06.540]  it has to fit the narrative for your
[01:56:06.540 --> 01:56:08.540]  cultivation model
[01:56:08.540 --> 01:56:10.540]  so a lot of times
[01:56:10.840 --> 01:56:12.840]  if it doesn't finish in 63 days
[01:56:12.840 --> 01:56:14.840]  it's like finish in 6 weeks facts
[01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:16.840]  dude if you can finish in 6 weeks
[01:56:16.840 --> 01:56:18.840]  you're on Bubba Kush
[01:56:18.840 --> 01:56:20.840]  not that there's anything wrong with Bubba Kush
[01:56:20.840 --> 01:56:22.840]  dude Bubba Kush
[01:56:22.840 --> 01:56:24.840]  used to be so hot
[01:56:24.840 --> 01:56:26.840]  that was a good one but
[01:56:26.840 --> 01:56:28.840]  yeah that's where
[01:56:28.840 --> 01:56:30.840]  we got it from is the gold seal
[01:56:30.840 --> 01:56:32.840]  but I believe
[01:56:32.840 --> 01:56:34.840]  and then who has the Durban Red Beard
[01:56:34.840 --> 01:56:36.840]  Red Beard Farms has
[01:56:36.840 --> 01:56:38.840]  the Durban
[01:56:39.140 --> 01:56:41.140]  nobody wants anything over 10 weeks
[01:56:41.140 --> 01:56:43.140]  nobody wants anything over 9 weeks
[01:56:43.140 --> 01:56:45.140]  or 8 weeks now
[01:56:45.140 --> 01:56:47.140]  I got friends that do
[01:56:47.140 --> 01:56:49.140]  they have like 6 week varieties
[01:56:49.140 --> 01:56:51.140]  you can get so many harvests if that room is
[01:56:51.140 --> 01:56:53.140]  just for flowering a year it's crazy
[01:56:53.140 --> 01:56:55.140]  you start thinking about it and then you go on scale
[01:56:55.140 --> 01:56:57.140]  start adding it up
[01:56:57.140 --> 01:56:59.140]  but as far as
[01:56:59.140 --> 01:57:01.140]  the hot
[01:57:01.140 --> 01:57:03.140]  varieties that finish
[01:57:03.140 --> 01:57:05.140]  there's no exotic varieties that I know that finish
[01:57:05.140 --> 01:57:07.140]  in 6 weeks
[01:57:07.440 --> 01:57:09.440]  I think 9 weeks pretty much for everything
[01:57:09.440 --> 01:57:11.440]  maybe 8 weeks on some of them
[01:57:15.440 --> 01:57:17.440]  so legit pre-98 Bubba Kush autos
[01:57:17.440 --> 01:57:19.440]  yeah
[01:57:19.440 --> 01:57:21.440]  I remember when
[01:57:21.440 --> 01:57:23.440]  the guys were working on them in Spain
[01:57:23.440 --> 01:57:25.440]  in 2012
[01:57:25.440 --> 01:57:27.440]  or 2011
[01:57:27.440 --> 01:57:29.440]  they were doing autos
[01:57:29.440 --> 01:57:31.440]  and they just didn't have the
[01:57:31.440 --> 01:57:34.770]  they had the turps they just didn't have the peel
[01:57:34.770 --> 01:57:36.770]  Malawi Gold
[01:57:37.070 --> 01:57:39.070]  it was 120 days
[01:57:39.070 --> 01:57:41.070]  that's what's up
[01:57:41.070 --> 01:57:43.070]  nothing like some 120 days strains to kill your summer vibe
[01:57:45.070 --> 01:57:47.070]  it's not flowering
[01:57:47.070 --> 01:57:49.070]  come January it'll be done
[01:57:49.070 --> 01:57:51.070]  don't worry guys
[01:57:51.070 --> 01:57:53.070]  could you imagine if you had a room of that and it dudded
[01:57:53.070 --> 01:57:55.070]  and you found out on like
[01:57:55.070 --> 01:57:57.070]  day 100
[01:57:57.070 --> 01:57:59.070]  20 days to go
[01:57:59.070 --> 01:58:01.070]  I got an interesting tip for you guys
[01:58:01.070 --> 01:58:03.070]  if you guys are trying to get stuff to flip into flower
[01:58:03.070 --> 01:58:05.070]  some of these varieties don't want to flip
[01:58:05.370 --> 01:58:07.370]  they do not want to go into flower
[01:58:07.370 --> 01:58:09.370]  and then from the time they go into flower
[01:58:09.370 --> 01:58:11.370]  they can take an extra
[01:58:11.370 --> 01:58:13.370]  not just from the time you flip the lights
[01:58:13.370 --> 01:58:15.370]  typically we think of the lights being the
[01:58:15.370 --> 01:58:17.370]  factor that's going to keep them in the flower
[01:58:17.370 --> 01:58:19.370]  sometimes you have to change the temperature
[01:58:19.370 --> 01:58:21.370]  so there's more of a temperature swing
[01:58:21.370 --> 01:58:23.370]  between daytime and nighttime temps
[01:58:23.370 --> 01:58:25.370]  and then also
[01:58:25.370 --> 01:58:27.370]  spring PK on them
[01:58:27.370 --> 01:58:29.370]  definitely helps
[01:58:31.370 --> 01:58:33.370]  you can PK some flowering
[01:58:33.670 --> 01:58:35.670]  newts
[01:58:35.670 --> 01:58:37.670]  and just foliar them
[01:58:37.670 --> 01:58:39.670]  and that will help
[01:58:39.670 --> 01:58:41.670]  yeah it's interesting
[01:58:41.670 --> 01:58:43.670]  some of these varieties and stuff you have to do
[01:58:45.670 --> 01:58:47.670]  well guys
[01:58:47.670 --> 01:58:49.670]  I think that's going to be our show
[01:58:49.670 --> 01:58:51.670]  unless anybody else has some last minute questions
[01:58:57.180 --> 01:58:59.180]  no one wants to flower over 10
[01:58:59.180 --> 01:59:01.180]  what did they say?
[01:59:01.180 --> 01:59:03.180]  no one wants to flower over 10
[01:59:03.180 --> 01:59:05.180]  and then someone else was talking about the 120 day
[01:59:05.480 --> 01:59:07.480]  which I think is great
[01:59:07.480 --> 01:59:09.480]  so yeah thank you guys for
[01:59:09.480 --> 01:59:11.480]  watching I hope you enjoyed the show
[01:59:11.480 --> 01:59:13.480]  we're going to have some interesting stuff coming with the new studio
[01:59:13.480 --> 01:59:15.480]  happy Sunday
[01:59:15.480 --> 01:59:17.480]  we might even get Marlon singing on here one of these days
[01:59:24.150 --> 01:59:26.150]  this has been Jared
[01:59:26.150 --> 01:59:28.150]  you've been trying to get up
[01:59:28.150 --> 01:59:30.150]  guys how you doing Peter?
[01:59:30.150 --> 01:59:32.150]  I'm good
[01:59:32.150 --> 01:59:34.150]  my computer is all like
[01:59:34.150 --> 01:59:36.150]  sluggish right now so I'm trying to quit everything
[01:59:36.150 --> 01:59:38.150]  but uh
[01:59:38.450 --> 01:59:40.450]  you guys hanging out in the backyard?
[01:59:40.450 --> 01:59:42.450]  too hot in the house?
[01:59:42.450 --> 01:59:44.450]  well I thought this would be like
[01:59:44.450 --> 01:59:46.450]  relaxed for me
[01:59:46.450 --> 01:59:48.450]  and then you guys started like
[01:59:48.450 --> 01:59:50.450]  interacting with the chat nonstop
[01:59:50.450 --> 01:59:52.450]  so I was like fucks sake
[01:59:52.450 --> 01:59:54.450]  I thought I could just walk around the garden and just listen
[01:59:54.450 --> 01:59:56.450]  I figured you were eating sandwiches or something
[01:59:56.450 --> 01:59:58.450]  yeah I'm eating hummus
[01:59:58.450 --> 02:00:00.450]  and chips right now
[02:00:00.450 --> 02:00:02.450]  I'll get a sandwich in a second
[02:00:02.450 --> 02:00:04.450]  just quickly so today is Sunday
[02:00:04.450 --> 02:00:06.450]  Tuesday morning we got Don Huber
[02:00:06.750 --> 02:00:08.750]  soil scientist from Purdue
[02:00:12.750 --> 02:00:14.750]  that's about all I can remember right now
[02:00:14.750 --> 02:00:16.750]  but that's it
[02:00:16.750 --> 02:00:18.750]  yeah we're going to go eat some pizza
[02:00:18.750 --> 02:00:20.750]  I got a pizza oven
[02:00:20.750 --> 02:00:22.750]  I just got one of those outdoor wood fire pizza stoves
[02:00:22.750 --> 02:00:24.750]  or ovens
[02:00:24.750 --> 02:00:26.750]  and we're just going to go crush some pizza
[02:00:26.750 --> 02:00:28.750]  that sounds
[02:00:28.750 --> 02:00:30.750]  delicious
[02:00:30.750 --> 02:00:32.750]  alright have a good one
[02:00:32.750 --> 02:00:34.750]  have a good one everyone
[02:00:36.750 --> 02:00:38.750]  hold on
[02:00:38.750 --> 02:00:40.750]  everyone bear with me while I try to
[02:00:40.750 --> 02:00:42.750]  get this thing going
