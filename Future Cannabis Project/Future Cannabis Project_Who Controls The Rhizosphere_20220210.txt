[00:00.000 --> 00:06.560]  I used to breed dogs, so they're going to be coming and visiting me or barking at the cat as it goes by
[00:09.440 --> 00:16.440]  Well, maybe maybe your dogs and latent dogs can bark at each other on screen here has his kids
[00:20.760 --> 00:25.180]  So actually so we're live and and you're just saying you you were a trucker, right
[00:26.180 --> 00:31.540]  Yeah, just about 20 years and if I was physically able I wouldn't be here in front of you
[00:31.540 --> 00:35.780]  I'd be sitting in Ottawa right now with my brothers and sisters fighting for our freedom
[00:37.940 --> 00:39.940]  Got it and
[00:40.140 --> 00:43.260]  And you are now in Alberta
[00:44.540 --> 00:48.020]  yeah, I was born and raised a country boy in Alberta and
[00:49.900 --> 00:54.520]  You know I I've been on a journey of discovery since I was you know
[00:55.700 --> 01:00.060]  Very very young they couldn't keep me inside the box. They actually built a
[01:00.580 --> 01:04.940]  Corral to hold me in they called it Kenny's corral and
[01:05.740 --> 01:07.740]  They couldn't keep me in
[01:08.100 --> 01:14.940]  I've never been one to stay inside the box. They found me we moved to the city for I don't know maybe a month because
[01:15.660 --> 01:18.300]  My brother and sister went to school. I was too young
[01:18.300 --> 01:24.180]  I was like pre preschool and they found me sitting on top of a light pole on
[01:24.740 --> 01:30.260]  The street looking to find if I could see where my brother and sister had just left and walked to school
[01:30.660 --> 01:33.140]  And of course they called the fire department to get me down
[01:34.380 --> 01:41.780]  But yeah, I I'm I'm that guy that Brian wanted that watches a whole shit ton of videos
[01:42.540 --> 01:44.900]  Takes a deep dive down the rabbit hole
[01:45.700 --> 01:51.500]  Unfortunately, I keep finding the wormholes that are in the rabbit hole and then I went down there and then of course
[01:52.380 --> 01:54.180]  Mr. Layton
[01:54.180 --> 02:00.940]  Has led me down. Oh my god the microbiology and the fungal hyphae and
[02:01.580 --> 02:07.060]  I found you guys through Kevin Jodry. I was was fascinated with what he was saying and
[02:08.020 --> 02:12.300]  I watched shango's podcast and all respect to shango
[02:13.180 --> 02:18.500]  Because that led me to you guys and my life has been changed
[02:19.020 --> 02:21.020]  I didn't grow cannabis
[02:21.540 --> 02:25.900]  I grew, you know organic vegetables and stuff like that
[02:26.540 --> 02:30.100]  An injury led me to cannabis and cannabis has given me back
[02:30.900 --> 02:32.900]  A life I had thought I had lost
[02:33.700 --> 02:38.260]  My back I blew it out so bad. I have nerves sticking out the side of my spine and
[02:38.780 --> 02:41.180]  Any type of pressure whether it's sitting or standing?
[02:41.980 --> 02:43.980]  I can only do so long
[02:45.260 --> 02:47.260]  Before my back starts to cramp up
[02:48.260 --> 02:50.740]  Cannabis gave me the
[02:52.580 --> 02:54.580]  How would I say the
[02:55.860 --> 03:02.820]  Part of my life back where I don't cramp I can come close and if you've ever been on the edge of a leg
[03:02.820 --> 03:04.820]  cramp and that
[03:04.860 --> 03:07.900]  Tension just think of that in your entire back
[03:08.700 --> 03:10.700]  starting to spasm and bounce
[03:11.460 --> 03:13.500]  that's what I had and
[03:14.460 --> 03:16.460]  Cannabis has allowed me to
[03:16.780 --> 03:22.180]  Take that back to a point where unless I get stupid and I really push my body
[03:22.180 --> 03:27.620]  I I can function as a normal part of society. I will never be able to work again
[03:27.620 --> 03:34.900]  And that's why I have actually had the time to watch the thousands of hours of videos from Elaine
[03:36.700 --> 03:39.660]  From well from Layton and you guys and
[03:40.540 --> 03:43.140]  Shango and all over the place
[03:44.740 --> 03:46.740]  My journey
[03:47.620 --> 03:50.100]  Let me tell you I'm not gonna go through my story
[03:50.100 --> 03:54.740]  It's it's long complex and it goes through the energy side. It goes through this and that
[03:56.140 --> 04:02.540]  When I was in high school, I think grade 11. I was arguing with my English teacher and
[04:04.300 --> 04:05.540]  She's
[04:05.540 --> 04:11.020]  Was teaching something that I knew because I had researched it and so I was calling her out on
[04:11.380 --> 04:14.420]  the mistakes she was making and telling the class and
[04:15.140 --> 04:19.660]  She got you know a little bit angry, you know smoke who smoke was coming out of her ears
[04:19.740 --> 04:23.300]  And she looked at me and says oh, you're just a learned fool
[04:24.420 --> 04:27.340]  I'm picking okay. What the hell is a learned fool?
[04:28.220 --> 04:33.380]  She said, you know a little bit about everything but not a hell of a lot about anything
[04:34.380 --> 04:35.980]  Basically
[04:35.980 --> 04:37.780]  when you look at
[04:37.780 --> 04:43.060]  Academia, they put a set of blinders on you and you're not allowed to look here
[04:43.060 --> 04:46.900]  You're not allowed to look there. You can only look in this specific area
[04:48.180 --> 04:53.940]  That's the fool part to be only able to see this one little narrow
[04:54.820 --> 04:56.820]  Avenue of exploration
[04:57.420 --> 05:04.780]  I've taken the approach where I step back from that and I observe and learn from everything and I'm able to
[05:05.380 --> 05:12.740]  pick the gold nuggets from this guy and from this guy and put them together to form the gold mine and
[05:13.940 --> 05:15.940]  my mind is
[05:16.260 --> 05:20.240]  And I'm not tooting my horn. I don't have ego because I really you know
[05:20.720 --> 05:27.640]  On the other side when you're facing whatever you call is source that energy that has created us all
[05:28.560 --> 05:34.480]  Who are you answering for are you answering for somebody on the chat? That was going? Oh, you're an asshole
[05:35.320 --> 05:41.760]  No, it's what you did. It was your response to him that actually is gonna matter on the other side
[05:42.040 --> 05:48.400]  You need to build up that psychic karma so that when you get to the other side the bad things you have done in your life
[05:49.280 --> 05:51.840]  Are so out of balance with all the good
[05:52.480 --> 05:58.280]  You don't have any worries and that's where I lost my ego not that long ago
[05:59.040 --> 06:02.000]  Because my journey, you know is still in
[06:02.720 --> 06:09.840]  Constant flux as we tell our everybody about the soil. Everything is in flow. It's always moving and growing and changing
[06:11.040 --> 06:16.520]  So I gave up my ego. I don't care what people think about me. I know who I am
[06:16.520 --> 06:18.680]  I know the knowledge I have and
[06:20.280 --> 06:26.440]  I'm more than willing to share it and in the last two shows you guys have basically called me out
[06:27.240 --> 06:35.400]  You wanted somebody that will watch the videos you wanted somebody that would talk without ego and you wanted somebody that would bring a new
[06:35.640 --> 06:37.520]  dimension to the conversation
[06:37.520 --> 06:42.200]  And look at things that you've never even looked at because you didn't even know they existed
[06:42.560 --> 06:49.840]  I've went down those rabbit holes and found things that just have amazed me and I would love the opportunity and
[06:50.320 --> 06:57.760]  Thank you for the opportunity to share what I have learned and to ask you all the community
[06:58.440 --> 07:00.680]  Layton Brian Peter to
[07:01.520 --> 07:05.800]  Check my work to look at the thought patterns in the process
[07:05.800 --> 07:10.480]  I went through to get to the understanding I have and poke holes in it
[07:11.000 --> 07:14.240]  Because I don't know everything I'm a bloody truck driver
[07:15.160 --> 07:18.400]  Okay, I'm not a soil scientist. I'm not a
[07:19.360 --> 07:26.940]  Doctor, you know, I've met lots of lawyers and doctors that were truck drivers and most truck drivers if you scratch their surface
[07:26.940 --> 07:32.860]  They're a philosopher you spend 15 16 hours a day alone in a vehicle driving down a highway
[07:33.240 --> 07:36.680]  you start to think a lot you start to talk to yourself and
[07:36.680 --> 07:41.440]  I'll tell you yeah, you do start to fucking answer your own questions. Okay, you know
[07:41.960 --> 07:45.400]  It's just the nature of the beast. You're thinking all the time. I
[07:46.560 --> 07:51.760]  When I get into a big truck, you know a hundred thousand pounds behind me
[07:52.320 --> 07:56.400]  My brain actually goes into float mode. I don't look at the
[07:57.760 --> 08:03.160]  Highway in front of me with my conscious brain my subconscious though
[08:03.160 --> 08:09.960]  My subconscious though, it sees everything and I've trained it where if I see something that doesn't fit
[08:10.680 --> 08:17.480]  That that's when my subconscious goes. Yo, buddy. Wake up. There's a car coming to that intersection. You better pay attention
[08:18.800 --> 08:25.480]  I've went for literally hours and hours and hours and got to my destination. Holy fuck. How'd I get here?
[08:26.760 --> 08:27.960]  Okay
[08:27.960 --> 08:30.320]  This sounds kind of terrifying that oh
[08:31.280 --> 08:32.560]  It is in a way
[08:32.560 --> 08:38.600]  But I I see things on the side of the road way that you would never see Brian because I've trained myself
[08:39.160 --> 08:41.160]  to see what isn't
[08:42.120 --> 08:48.360]  Typical it's not supposed to be there when you look at your plants. You're looking for what's not supposed to be there
[08:48.440 --> 08:50.440]  You're looking for the signs of a deficiency
[08:51.360 --> 08:55.760]  When you spend enough time with your plants you train your brain your subconscious
[08:56.320 --> 09:01.120]  To see those little anomalies to see oh, holy shit that baby's got a calcium deficiency
[09:01.360 --> 09:04.680]  I have to add something to make her healthy
[09:06.320 --> 09:09.440]  When you do that when you spend that much time in
[09:10.160 --> 09:14.480]  Anything whether it's energy work whether it's driving a truck
[09:14.560 --> 09:19.840]  Whether it's walking or talking because think about in the first five years of your life is when you learn
[09:20.280 --> 09:23.600]  Literally half of what you understand as an adult
[09:24.480 --> 09:31.320]  So you got to stuff everything in there that you possibly can into that child so that they have a better foundation and
[09:31.880 --> 09:36.720]  Understanding of how the world actually works and we're kind of a little off topic. So
[09:38.000 --> 09:39.880]  Well to get into the how the world works
[09:39.880 --> 09:45.760]  I mean that was what you and I had a lovely conversation now when we were talking about the rhizosphere, you know
[09:45.760 --> 09:50.800]  And you're you you know expressed to me, you know, who's really in control of the rhizosphere
[09:50.800 --> 09:58.920]  What's really going on during that like is the plants really communicating or are the exudates and and through like the microbial world?
[09:59.680 --> 10:01.680]  Finding ways to communicate with the plant
[10:01.960 --> 10:06.080]  So I wanted to just kind of let the audience know that you've also gone out of your way
[10:06.080 --> 10:10.160]  You have a like a PowerPoint presentation that you're gonna go over as well. So
[10:10.800 --> 10:13.440]  There's just a lot of information that we're gonna go over today
[10:14.000 --> 10:17.280]  Especially when it comes more to the world of the the rhizosphere
[10:17.280 --> 10:20.160]  so I was I was hoping Ken maybe we could kind of talk on that and
[10:21.200 --> 10:24.180]  Maybe start that that PowerPoint presentation as well
[10:25.440 --> 10:30.800]  Do you want to go through the whole presentation or because that's that's actually a fairly lengthy
[10:32.120 --> 10:33.280]  discussion
[10:33.280 --> 10:40.960]  Or do you want me to just stay more into the rhizosphere and the topic at hand is who's actually in control of?
[10:41.160 --> 10:46.120]  The microbiology that's in our soil and in our own bodies and in our plants
[10:46.920 --> 10:49.640]  The rhizosphere is just a part of it
[10:51.320 --> 10:54.200]  Well when we had discussed you were talking about the PowerPoint
[10:54.200 --> 10:58.240]  So I would say let's let's give the audience the PowerPoint and then we can kind of add to
[10:58.920 --> 11:03.280]  That as well. Okay. Sure Peter you want to bring up the first slide?
[11:04.320 --> 11:05.520]  I
[11:05.520 --> 11:08.960]  was asked after talking to a friend and
[11:09.880 --> 11:16.680]  sharing the information in the understanding that I have to come to a homeschool mothers group and
[11:17.680 --> 11:22.280]  To teach the mothers this kind of information to share with their children and
[11:23.080 --> 11:27.080]  This is the presentation I used and I called it adventures with Ken
[11:29.120 --> 11:31.560]  So the next slide please Peter
[11:37.060 --> 11:38.380]  Okay, so
[11:38.380 --> 11:46.580]  Most of you that have followed dr. Elaine will have seen this or dr. Robert Johnson the guy that developed the Johnson's zoo bioreactor
[11:46.820 --> 11:51.940]  This is how our world formed with the microbiology
[11:52.860 --> 11:57.460]  You know and you look at the the time span in billions of years
[11:57.460 --> 12:00.860]  You know the first 4.2 billion. We only had water and
[12:01.460 --> 12:06.700]  Then at a certain point we got the BYA bacteria
[12:07.220 --> 12:08.420]  so
[12:08.420 --> 12:13.380]  If you understand bacteria and Leighton can speak to this a lot better than I'll ever be able to
[12:13.540 --> 12:18.980]  As I understand that they can only move or grow out approximately one inch a year
[12:19.500 --> 12:26.660]  So look at the time scale of one that first bacteria came into existence to when the next came in
[12:27.060 --> 12:32.260]  Okay, it was you know point eight billion years or four
[12:32.260 --> 12:36.340]  I'm sorry point two billion years from when the first bacteria was developed
[12:36.980 --> 12:40.020]  If you understand predator and prey relationship
[12:40.020 --> 12:45.140]  Then you understand that if you don't have a food source you don't exist
[12:45.780 --> 12:47.780]  so for the bacteria
[12:48.340 --> 12:51.940]  when it was first formed was it starting the
[12:52.740 --> 12:58.660]  Cycle of when I have enough bacteria developed on this planet then I can develop the next one
[12:58.980 --> 13:03.300]  Because now the next generation has the food source, which is the first generation
[13:04.020 --> 13:08.420]  And then you have a slow growth and then you have a slow growth
[13:08.420 --> 13:16.580]  And then you have a slow progression you look at 3.4 billion years ago is when the precursors of a virus came out
[13:16.820 --> 13:19.700]  they didn't start at the beginning the bacteria did and
[13:20.620 --> 13:22.620]  Then we can go a lot deeper
[13:23.460 --> 13:27.380]  On to you know, the nitro fix or the nitrogen fixing bacteria
[13:28.020 --> 13:32.860]  You look at oil. What is oil made of what is coal made of it's made of lingon
[13:33.500 --> 13:38.620]  Winded lingon bacteria that could break down those molecular bonds
[13:39.020 --> 13:45.740]  Into something different come into existence. What was that difference? It became oil. That's what we're pumping out of the ground
[13:46.220 --> 13:47.900]  That's that carbon
[13:47.900 --> 13:51.680]  But until the bacteria that could break that particular
[13:52.540 --> 13:54.540]  substance down those particular
[13:55.480 --> 14:00.460]  Molecules could rip them apart was developed. We had these big huge cold apart
[14:01.100 --> 14:05.900]  Deposits now in this entire cycle every time there was a new
[14:06.740 --> 14:14.620]  Fungi bacteria or new form of life. It seems that they increased in their usage of the Sun
[14:15.260 --> 14:16.460]  now
[14:16.460 --> 14:22.380]  your plant takes the the photons and electrons or neutrons etc from the Sun and
[14:22.940 --> 14:28.380]  Turns that into their exudates there as Elaine says they're cookies and cake
[14:29.180 --> 14:36.780]  But how does the plant actually know what exudate it needs in order to go through that
[14:37.020 --> 14:39.020]  We would actually need to look at
[14:40.820 --> 14:46.140]  How our DNA and the plants DNA is formed now that isn't actually in this presentation
[14:46.980 --> 14:49.200]  but that's part of the why of how I
[14:49.820 --> 14:51.820]  Why I think the way I think
[14:52.660 --> 14:54.660]  but you can see that as
[14:55.620 --> 15:01.140]  The life on our planet has progressed things have sped up and sped up and sped up and
[15:01.900 --> 15:03.900]  is that because there is
[15:04.500 --> 15:06.500]  the bacteria and
[15:06.860 --> 15:14.180]  Or the food source growing for the next generation and because there's more and more and more of the base nutrients
[15:14.580 --> 15:20.120]  Broken down from the raw material that they can build more and build faster
[15:20.120 --> 15:27.520]  I think that maybe that's a possibility as you think of predator and prey we look at ourselves. Okay, we got a
[15:28.680 --> 15:30.120]  disposable thumb
[15:30.120 --> 15:32.760]  Okay, so we're the top of the food chain
[15:32.800 --> 15:39.480]  Well, baby, I'll tell you something if I got sent down in the middle of a pack of wolves
[15:40.120 --> 15:42.120]  Am I not just meat?
[15:42.560 --> 15:49.320]  Okay, I become the prey. I'm no longer the predator. I'm no longer the top of the food chain. I'm just in the food chain
[15:50.120 --> 15:53.560]  And when you start understanding that you're nothing more than
[15:54.680 --> 15:55.920]  biology
[15:55.920 --> 16:02.400]  Then you start to get a little bit closer to how our world actually works. So we can go the next slide Peter
[16:09.800 --> 16:15.560]  Okay, and I know all you guys have seen this chart that's our into living soil
[16:16.480 --> 16:18.480]  your fungal to bacterial
[16:19.200 --> 16:25.600]  Bacterial ratio at the top you have your old growth forest at 22 to 100
[16:26.560 --> 16:28.560]  fungi to bacteria and
[16:28.920 --> 16:31.680]  You can't have an oak tree
[16:32.440 --> 16:36.080]  At the other end of the spectrum now Layton always is talking about
[16:37.040 --> 16:40.760]  Sometimes you have to go back before you can go forward
[16:41.120 --> 16:45.400]  You have to have the bacteria that can break down these specific
[16:46.120 --> 16:48.120]  nutrients these
[16:48.560 --> 16:50.480]  specific atoms
[16:50.480 --> 16:52.760]  Before they can actually build the next generation
[16:53.680 --> 16:57.320]  You can't build a cell without
[16:58.240 --> 17:01.560]  every specific atom on the molecular scale
[17:02.400 --> 17:06.800]  To create that cell. Well, actually you can but the cell isn't healthy
[17:07.240 --> 17:11.240]  just like your plant is and healthy if it doesn't have all of
[17:11.840 --> 17:17.560]  The periodic table of elements available to it so that it can express its genetic potential
[17:18.120 --> 17:24.320]  I think that's part of what we're missing if we don't have say enough calcium in our soil and
[17:25.080 --> 17:31.720]  Your plant needs that extra calcium. Is it ever going to reach its genetic potential? Well, there's no fucking way
[17:32.400 --> 17:34.400]  It can't it isn't possible
[17:35.000 --> 17:37.600]  You guys mr. Toad, you know
[17:37.600 --> 17:44.420]  He's out there breeding and I love that guy because he's doing it from here. He's doing it for people
[17:44.420 --> 17:48.660]  He's not doing it for money. He's doing it for the love of the plant and love of people
[17:48.700 --> 17:53.080]  But if he wants to express a really high red
[17:53.620 --> 17:58.380]  You know at the end of his cycle if he doesn't have the proper
[17:59.660 --> 18:03.220]  atomic values in his soil system that the
[18:03.820 --> 18:05.820]  Microbiology can create that
[18:06.340 --> 18:14.380]  Pigmentation he's never gonna have that now if he grew a seed for me and he did achieve that in his soil system
[18:14.700 --> 18:18.300]  What's to say that my soil system has that particular?
[18:19.780 --> 18:27.420]  Microbe that creates or can mine that particular atom or does it have to be developed in my system?
[18:28.020 --> 18:34.300]  You guys are mentioning I think in the the rise zone of spirit episode that buddy soil system crashed
[18:35.500 --> 18:39.980]  Did it crash because it actually had to revert to something?
[18:40.260 --> 18:44.020]  To read the genetic code and had to have a very specific
[18:44.860 --> 18:46.580]  biology and
[18:46.580 --> 18:52.180]  Be able to strip those particular atoms out of sand silt clay and organic material
[18:52.660 --> 18:58.900]  to be able to feed the plant and express what the plant had as a genetic potential if
[18:59.700 --> 19:04.940]  He didn't have what was necessary and the plants calling for it. Did his microbiology?
[19:05.460 --> 19:12.640]  Take the plunge and shift back to more bacterial because that's the only microbe or microbe that can actually
[19:13.260 --> 19:17.940]  strip that particular atom out of the sand silt and clay I
[19:18.740 --> 19:19.700]  Don't know
[19:19.700 --> 19:25.280]  That's I want to bring Layton in on that because Ken you and I were discussing that when we were on the phone and I'd
[19:25.280 --> 19:28.840]  Love to kind of just dive deeper with Layton on that that subject
[19:29.260 --> 19:31.260]  please
[19:35.580 --> 19:42.100]  Soil systems are an entity and that's that's where I think the disconnect
[19:43.020 --> 19:45.020]  happens a lot with people is that
[19:45.620 --> 19:50.260]  They don't understand that as an entity you're gonna go through different growth phases
[19:51.860 --> 19:57.540]  You're gonna mature to a certain point and then you're gonna crash you're either gonna die or you're gonna come back renewed
[19:58.780 --> 20:02.540]  You know, this is more in nature not in a controlled action
[20:02.540 --> 20:06.340]  Environmental environment where you can control a lot more of these
[20:07.340 --> 20:09.340]  potential
[20:09.540 --> 20:11.540]  influences like extreme weather
[20:12.540 --> 20:15.580]  You know extreme cold extreme drought, you know
[20:15.580 --> 20:21.980]  All of those things that crash a system or you know an earthquake or a volcano or tornado
[20:21.980 --> 20:23.980]  all those things are basically
[20:24.860 --> 20:26.860]  geo resets or
[20:26.940 --> 20:29.620]  Gaia reset so in this particular
[20:29.620 --> 20:36.300]  Application, I don't think we have to go too deep down the rabbit hole as long as you understand that nature resets all the time
[20:37.220 --> 20:42.660]  You know, this has been going on for like like Ken just showed you billions of years and you know
[20:42.660 --> 20:47.860]  it's interesting that you showed that that that sphere and then the increase of
[20:48.580 --> 20:52.940]  Diversity to where we are at this point in time and you know
[20:52.940 --> 20:54.940]  I want to I want to throw this out there
[20:54.940 --> 21:01.180]  And you know, I want to I want to throw this out there for for people to really think about and that is that
[21:02.380 --> 21:04.380]  We're at a half-life
[21:04.380 --> 21:07.620]  So in 2012 the Sun stopped burning
[21:08.220 --> 21:10.800]  Hydrogen and started burning helium
[21:11.340 --> 21:16.720]  And that's why today the Sun is is a lot whiter than it used to be used to be more yellow
[21:17.300 --> 21:23.380]  And the interesting thing was I noticed that when I was playing golf believe it or not because when you have a drive
[21:23.700 --> 21:26.260]  You can see that golf ball going out
[21:26.260 --> 21:33.220]  But when the Sun got to be a lot whiter you could no longer see that white ball traveling as easy as you used
[21:33.820 --> 21:40.460]  And that sent me down a rabbit hole of trying to understand. Well, what does that really mean? And I really encourage
[21:41.220 --> 21:43.220]  the audience to watch
[21:43.500 --> 21:47.140]  How the universe works? It's a 24-hour
[21:47.820 --> 21:52.820]  Documentary on showing everything from quasars to white dwarfs
[21:53.380 --> 22:00.780]  Red dwarfs red giants explains how the system really works. So to wrap this back in we hit our half-life
[22:01.540 --> 22:02.860]  right around
[22:02.860 --> 22:04.300]  2012 and
[22:04.300 --> 22:11.260]  so it only makes sense that the diversity on this planet was was peaking or hitting the bell curve the top and
[22:12.500 --> 22:17.540]  Unfortunately, the reality of it is going to start going into a slow decline
[22:18.180 --> 22:22.660]  Before we really go into a rapid decline in another couple billion years
[22:22.660 --> 22:25.060]  But we don't have to worry about that shit people
[22:27.620 --> 22:31.940]  One of us is gonna be around it to witness the decline at that level
[22:31.940 --> 22:35.620]  I think that the sad part of the news or a sad part of the
[22:36.300 --> 22:40.100]  Picture is that if we had not if we had evolved
[22:40.740 --> 22:47.220]  Together with Gaia and that means all of the animals plants and biology that was present on the plant
[22:47.620 --> 22:49.620]  instead of evolving toward
[22:50.060 --> 22:53.100]  Power money greed and possession
[22:54.500 --> 22:58.660]  Think of the fucking potential we would have as a species
[22:58.660 --> 23:00.740]  I mean if there were no wars
[23:01.100 --> 23:07.260]  There was no there was no money spent to kill or steal or take anything from anybody
[23:07.420 --> 23:13.580]  all of that wealth could have gone back into our health to our mental health to our
[23:14.700 --> 23:16.700]  encouragement of science and
[23:17.220 --> 23:18.620]  Interdisciplinary
[23:18.620 --> 23:25.020]  interdisciplinary work to discover life on another level or maybe the multiverses or or
[23:25.580 --> 23:30.820]  Exploration of other planets to find other life. I mean, I've got to believe life is on comments
[23:30.820 --> 23:33.860]  I gotta believe life is in other soil systems perhaps
[23:34.660 --> 23:38.100]  It has a size that we just don't comprehend yet
[23:38.740 --> 23:45.180]  Correct, you know, I've often thought that there's probably life on the Sun which is fucking
[23:45.740 --> 23:49.820]  Mind-blowing, but if you look at volcanic vents at the bottom of the ocean
[23:52.300 --> 23:58.140]  That's totally inhospitable and yet exists where we never expected it to exist
[23:58.780 --> 24:04.740]  Correct. And and as we learn more and more about the planets around us, we're also finding that there are
[24:05.340 --> 24:10.700]  other atmospheres that perhaps would also support life that was a
[24:11.340 --> 24:14.740]  Capable of living in very harsh conditions. Okay Layton
[24:15.180 --> 24:21.740]  I actually found a study it was caves in New Mexico and they found they were doing some ground penetrating
[24:22.060 --> 24:28.580]  Radar and they found a cave that was deeper in where a human being can't breathe. They have to use special apparatus
[24:29.020 --> 24:30.740]  The heat is extreme
[24:30.740 --> 24:37.300]  they they put special teams together to go in and explore this and they found biology and
[24:37.940 --> 24:39.340]  plant
[24:39.340 --> 24:43.260]  Mosses, of course, but things that have never seen the light of day
[24:43.700 --> 24:46.580]  Don't live in an oxygen-rich environment and
[24:47.300 --> 24:49.780]  They're growing. They're just as happy as can be
[24:50.580 --> 24:56.700]  We don't know half of what we need to know and the powers that be don't want us to know correct
[24:57.260 --> 24:59.940]  Correct. Yeah, keeping us ignorant. They have control
[25:01.020 --> 25:04.660]  Exactly, and that's where this community is. So bloody important
[25:04.660 --> 25:09.420]  I have to give a shout out to a gentleman called Johnny B or Johnny burr fellow
[25:10.100 --> 25:15.300]  He's actually one of the founders of getting cannabis legalized in Canada
[25:16.140 --> 25:21.340]  He's one of the guys that I started following early on when I started researching growing cannabis
[25:21.340 --> 25:26.060]  I've been smoking cannabis since I was 8 years old and I didn't stop until I was a truck driver
[25:26.580 --> 25:30.100]  Crossing the border and of course, you know how that goes you don't do that
[25:30.660 --> 25:36.460]  You know teach you Chong got away with it, but the whole van was on smoke. Okay, you know
[25:36.460 --> 25:40.380]  I've used actually that 30-inch paper from the up and smoke
[25:41.100 --> 25:45.220]  Album that came out actually bought about ten of them. But anyway
[25:47.140 --> 25:53.820]  There's so much that they don't want us to really understand if you go to the movie avatar and
[25:55.220 --> 25:59.060]  You talk to people that have watched that it's all of a sudden. It's like
[25:59.780 --> 26:03.180]  What why don't we have that? Well, we did
[26:03.860 --> 26:09.700]  Until it was beat out of us. Oh, no, you can't do that. That's impossible. Oh, no. No, no
[26:09.700 --> 26:15.540]  We get that from you know, the moment your parent talks to you and says no don't do that
[26:16.340 --> 26:20.660]  You know, you're gonna hurt yourself. We do it out of love and trying to protect
[26:21.220 --> 26:27.380]  But how do we learn we learn by touching we learn by feeling we learn by smelling by hearing etc
[26:27.940 --> 26:33.580]  Without giving them that opportunity to experience that world themselves and maybe yeah get hurt
[26:33.900 --> 26:38.860]  But I tell you when you get hurt touching the fire, you don't generally do it again
[26:39.660 --> 26:46.780]  Unless you're really really high or on mushrooms or something. You know, you just your brain goes. Oh, no, no, don't do that
[26:47.780 --> 26:48.820]  but
[26:48.820 --> 26:54.620]  In our soil systems, we've taken this approach that we're God. Okay, we know everything
[26:55.220 --> 27:02.700]  Fuck guys, we know nothing. Talk to dr. Elaine. Okay, see what she says, but how much she understands of the microbiology
[27:03.340 --> 27:05.860]  And she's gonna tell you like less than 1%
[27:06.780 --> 27:13.260]  Okay, cuz we're just touching the surface like Layton was looking for a name of a microscope. I think it was the electron microscope
[27:13.260 --> 27:15.260]  he he wanted to
[27:15.860 --> 27:21.260]  Connect in his brain, but when you start looking at that level, then you're looking at quantum physics
[27:21.260 --> 27:22.580]  You're looking at string theory
[27:22.580 --> 27:26.860]  You're looking at them saying that we exist in in seven to twelve different
[27:27.140 --> 27:32.420]  Universes all at the same time and then you're going to really woohoo. Everybody goes. Oh man that no no
[27:32.420 --> 27:34.420]  No, you're you're all screwed up, man
[27:34.660 --> 27:40.060]  Well, they said the same thing to the hippies in the 60s. It said hey, man, I can see this guy's aura
[27:40.060 --> 27:46.820]  Man, is it ever beautiful and science has got okay, you know, just pick another hit LSD
[27:46.820 --> 27:49.620]  You know some mushrooms, you know, you're gonna be fine
[27:50.100 --> 27:52.100]  They're going that's all just woohoo
[27:52.180 --> 27:57.620]  No, it doesn't exist until they came out with Karelian photography and they could actually see it and record it
[27:57.620 --> 28:03.300]  So science fiction became science fact is the science fiction. They're showing us in a lot of our movies
[28:04.100 --> 28:11.500]  Actual fact they're they're showing it in such a way where they're going. Oh, it's all fake. It's just a fantasy
[28:12.100 --> 28:18.220]  But maybe it's not maybe it's more reality than we want to actually admit to our even ourselves
[28:18.500 --> 28:20.500]  Fear is what motivates everybody
[28:21.020 --> 28:22.180]  the fear of
[28:22.180 --> 28:29.500]  Not having enough money not having the fancy car or not even having a car or putting able to put fuel in your car
[28:30.260 --> 28:34.180]  Okay, I went from a hundred thousand dollar a year job to less than 20
[28:34.700 --> 28:39.660]  Okay, I have to budget for how many trips I can drive into the closest city
[28:39.660 --> 28:43.260]  Which is an hour away just because of the cost of the fuel
[28:43.900 --> 28:47.260]  when you get down to that level and your your
[28:47.700 --> 28:49.980]  Existence is you know food?
[28:50.620 --> 28:53.500]  shelter, you know the basics
[28:54.300 --> 29:00.820]  You start to look at life in a whole different perspective a millionaire looks at it from how much money do I have?
[29:01.500 --> 29:06.820]  If you're poor or living on the streets, you're looking at where am I gonna get my next meal? I'm hungry
[29:07.660 --> 29:15.860]  Okay, it's all perspective. I I've taken the overview perspective. I've taken the I will observe what's happening
[29:16.820 --> 29:22.540]  In our planet with the people on our planet what they're doing to our planet, but I won't absorb it
[29:22.540 --> 29:28.860]  I won't get into the emotional side of it because that doesn't really matter to me. It's
[29:29.780 --> 29:32.540]  okay, what's doing this and who's doing that and
[29:33.820 --> 29:37.860]  You know, they're freaking out about this and that and the other thing and it's like guys
[29:37.860 --> 29:40.900]  If you just step back and look at it with common sense and logic
[29:41.500 --> 29:45.140]  None of your arguments make sense because they're just emotion
[29:45.460 --> 29:52.220]  They're based on fear and when you fear if you've ever watched the movie Dune, there's a great line in there
[29:52.220 --> 29:54.540]  It's called fear is the mind killer
[29:55.540 --> 30:01.500]  You when you're in fear you you move into the fight-or-flight mode, which means your brain
[30:02.220 --> 30:08.580]  Shuts down when there's a car coming at you and you're on the highway and you're going. Oh fuck
[30:09.420 --> 30:13.660]  You have a choice you can steer to the right you can steer to the left
[30:14.500 --> 30:17.140]  but some people they just freeze in place and
[30:17.780 --> 30:24.820]  Their body takes over and their body freezes or some people they have the more flight in them and they're gonna turn the wheel and try
[30:24.820 --> 30:26.380]  to avoid
[30:26.380 --> 30:29.100]  But when your brain hits that fear may
[30:30.580 --> 30:34.540]  Spot your logical mind who you are
[30:34.860 --> 30:41.660]  Stops and your microbiology takes over because it's them that are actually running the muscles in your body
[30:41.660 --> 30:44.940]  You might signal that I want to walk forward
[30:45.460 --> 30:52.140]  But the synaptic message is where are they going to the muscles? Well who controls and makes the cells of the muscle?
[30:52.820 --> 30:57.060]  When you look at the the human genome every cell in your body
[30:57.780 --> 31:02.980]  Has your genetic code the full genetic code built right into it
[31:03.540 --> 31:09.380]  Who reads that genetic code who builds that cell and do they have the
[31:10.500 --> 31:13.260]  required elements to make a healthy cell or
[31:14.820 --> 31:20.620]  Not and is that what illness is the unhealthy cells because we don't have what we need
[31:21.100 --> 31:24.540]  in their bodies to give the microbiology the
[31:25.340 --> 31:31.060]  Atomic weights of nutrients that it needs to build that healthy cell. Sorry late and I interrupted that
[31:32.060 --> 31:35.700]  Don't worry that was a good one you can ran all you want I
[31:38.060 --> 31:40.620]  Did want to get back to his his presentation
[31:43.220 --> 31:50.320]  But but from from that like from the microbial world when we're getting into starting this, you know at the beginning
[31:50.320 --> 31:55.020]  It did seem like bacteria was all that anybody talked about and for my recollection
[31:55.140 --> 31:57.060]  Election
[31:57.060 --> 32:01.060]  Dr. Lane Ingham when she was being interviewed by this gentleman named Mitch Sanasa
[32:01.060 --> 32:04.340]  She was the first person that I've ever heard at least addressed the cannabis community
[32:04.740 --> 32:09.700]  That we were missing out on the full genetic profile of all of our cannabis plants
[32:10.100 --> 32:14.940]  Because we weren't adding all of that fungal. We didn't understand about building soil systems
[32:14.940 --> 32:16.940]  We know she was kind of teasing
[32:16.940 --> 32:22.420]  I felt like she was teasing us at that point like, you know, you you guys are supposedly like, you know
[32:22.420 --> 32:26.120]  You understand the plant so well, but from this from a soil point of view
[32:26.300 --> 32:31.940]  We just lack the knowledge back then and so that's why you know things continue to progress
[32:31.940 --> 32:35.100]  and that's why I also feel like a lot of the
[32:35.340 --> 32:39.500]  higher-end farmers are starting to understand more of what the old growth forest is and
[32:39.660 --> 32:43.620]  We might not necessarily be able to achieve all of that in an indoor environment
[32:43.620 --> 32:45.540]  But if that is the the end goal
[32:45.540 --> 32:51.980]  That's why I do see the top tier farmers being able to run their entire operations with just a handful of
[32:52.700 --> 32:58.620]  Employees we were even talking yesterday how labor is at the end of the day labor seems to be what really kills
[32:59.540 --> 33:04.340]  Cannabis farms and that kind of thing. So Peter if you can pull up his presentation
[33:05.180 --> 33:08.460]  For the newer farmer out there. I mean this chart right here
[33:09.060 --> 33:11.780]  There's some other ones out there where it shows from left to right
[33:11.780 --> 33:19.660]  So basically you have like the beach weeds and that progresses all the way down to trees and something else that I learned from. Dr
[33:19.660 --> 33:21.580]  Elaine Ingham, you know
[33:21.580 --> 33:27.300]  When she was first getting into studying this she was saying that the only thing she was being taught was NPK
[33:27.580 --> 33:29.580]  So for a little while there
[33:29.740 --> 33:37.140]  I guess the general consensus was the plants really only needed three three macros and then obviously we started to see that
[33:37.500 --> 33:42.900]  Calcium I feel like for the most of the community that seems like to be the fourth macro
[33:43.460 --> 33:45.500]  Calcium is king for a lot of people out there
[33:45.500 --> 33:49.320]  And once you we discovered that that's when we were talking about, you know
[33:49.320 --> 33:52.640]  Getting higher bricks levels and all of those things that we can achieve
[33:52.640 --> 33:57.200]  I feel like comes down from understanding the chart that you have up right now
[33:58.560 --> 33:59.760]  I'm
[33:59.760 --> 34:01.200]  definitely and
[34:01.200 --> 34:03.960]  Speaking of calcium just on a quick side note
[34:04.600 --> 34:10.880]  If you get into keto or carnivore or things like that, I found a video of a young lady
[34:10.880 --> 34:18.240]  I believe a massage therapist and she went a hundred percent carnivore and she went to a doctor in Vancouver
[34:18.240 --> 34:20.240]  and she's from the US and
[34:20.360 --> 34:22.360]  He was the only doctor that would
[34:22.480 --> 34:27.920]  Does this test they did a full body scan to see what nutrients were in the body?
[34:28.480 --> 34:30.800]  The doctor when he looked at those scans
[34:30.800 --> 34:35.560]  He thought that the person because he had never met her was 16 years old
[34:35.560 --> 34:42.000]  and that was because of the amount of calcium that was still in her thigh bones the woman was over 40 and
[34:43.120 --> 34:45.120]  Has already had a child
[34:45.160 --> 34:46.400]  so
[34:46.400 --> 34:48.400]  the diet she had or
[34:49.200 --> 34:50.680]  has
[34:50.680 --> 34:56.000]  Had created the excess of calcium in her body where it stored that calcium in her thigh bones
[34:56.000 --> 35:01.920]  Just like the cannabis plant stores that calcium in its lower leaves because calcium is a mobile nutrient
[35:02.400 --> 35:03.360]  but
[35:03.360 --> 35:10.880]  Just that side note of understanding that the human body and your plants body is a lot more similar than we want to let on
[35:11.520 --> 35:18.880]  Whether it's in in how the genetic codes are worked out or how our body is constructed or how our body functions and
[35:20.320 --> 35:22.320]  You know, there there's a
[35:22.560 --> 35:26.320]  Rabbit hole there that you know is is not hours long
[35:26.320 --> 35:30.560]  it's it's weeks long because you can go here and you can go there and
[35:31.040 --> 35:34.720]  It's when you start correlating all this different information. It's like
[35:35.360 --> 35:37.360]  Why haven't we seen this before?
[35:37.360 --> 35:43.680]  Let's go back to the presentation and we'll bring up the the next slide Peter and you'll understand
[35:44.560 --> 35:47.520]  You'll get it. You'll get a kick out of this guy this slide guys
[35:50.400 --> 35:56.080]  Microbiology in the plants and there's your scientists going. Okay, what's actually here?
[35:57.360 --> 36:02.240]  We we've been taught to keep our head in the sand folks and and not look you know
[36:02.800 --> 36:05.280]  Science can only go so far with the science
[36:05.440 --> 36:09.360]  Science can only go so far with the equipment they actually have right now
[36:09.840 --> 36:13.920]  And each day that elaine looks in a microscope and finds a new
[36:14.720 --> 36:16.720]  You know piece of the puzzle
[36:17.280 --> 36:22.080]  She's adding to that. That's where I love that woman. I don't necessarily agree with everything
[36:22.080 --> 36:24.880]  She says I don't necessarily agree with everything layton says
[36:25.520 --> 36:28.000]  but when you take the whole thing
[36:29.040 --> 36:31.040]  It it is just
[36:31.040 --> 36:32.640]  It's mind-blowing
[36:32.640 --> 36:34.640]  So we'll go to the next slide peter, please
[36:36.160 --> 36:42.740]  It's just the point of we know next to nothing about anything and this is one of those examples
[36:44.000 --> 36:50.080]  Okay, pure water doesn't freeze at 32 degrees fahrenheit or which is zero celsius
[36:50.720 --> 36:55.540]  It actually stays liquid until minus 35 to 40 degrees fahrenheit
[36:57.040 --> 37:02.720]  Okay, how the heck is that possible like hey man, I live in canada I deal with freezing temperatures
[37:03.040 --> 37:08.320]  Okay, i've trucked up into the arctic circle where you know i'm driving across an ice road
[37:09.600 --> 37:14.800]  Now but then you can look, you know two miles off in the distance and you can see the ocean and you know
[37:14.800 --> 37:18.560]  You can see the waves because that water isn't freezing. Why?
[37:19.920 --> 37:24.580]  It takes a plaque of dust a soot of the sea salt to combine with that molecule
[37:25.440 --> 37:27.440]  To actually make it freeze
[37:28.320 --> 37:32.880]  At 32 fahrenheit or zero celsius pure water doesn't
[37:33.760 --> 37:36.560]  Okay, next slide, please. Peter. Can you define pure water?
[37:37.520 --> 37:43.680]  um, basically nothing in it, uh, your ro water is basically, uh a pure water your um,
[37:44.880 --> 37:49.440]  Uh steam machine. I can't remember the the term off the tip of my top of my head that that uh
[37:49.920 --> 37:55.760]  Steams the water and then it collects the steam. There's distilled the wife is helping me out here. Um
[37:56.640 --> 38:02.400]  The wife's always helping out man. Oh, hey, baby. Happy wife. Happy life. Remember that guys, okay?
[38:03.200 --> 38:08.560]  Especially uh brian, you know when she's got that craving don't hesitate to go get it. Okay
[38:09.920 --> 38:14.640]  Like I said, I got pickles in the fridge already buddy. Oh and actually, you know, we talked about that
[38:15.360 --> 38:19.360]  and that actually sent me on a whole different direction that that
[38:20.160 --> 38:22.560]  Why does a woman have i'm sorry guys?
[38:22.880 --> 38:25.520]  We're gonna go i'm gonna go on a little side track here
[38:26.480 --> 38:28.480]  Brian, why do you think your wife?
[38:28.800 --> 38:32.160]  And peter you can jump in here too has cravings for
[38:32.800 --> 38:38.400]  Certain things whether it's the the pickles and ice cream or this day. It's strawberry ice cream. The next day is chocolate
[38:38.480 --> 38:44.640]  Why do you think that she her body is going? Hey, I need this. Why why do they you think they have cravings?
[38:46.080 --> 38:50.560]  I I think especially the pickles and stuff. That's more of like a salt. They're craving uh salt
[38:51.040 --> 38:58.560]  Fermented foods potentially as well. Um, as far as I understand pickles are just fermented cucumbers, correct? They are
[39:00.160 --> 39:07.060]  It's the fermentation process that's that's you know, I believe that they're craving at that point the fermentation
[39:07.360 --> 39:14.080]  Yeah, the fermentation is so good for our gut biome. It's not funny. Yes, definitely really really important
[39:15.120 --> 39:19.760]  But I think women are more um in tune with their body than men perhaps
[39:20.720 --> 39:22.800]  not all cases, you know, there's always
[39:23.440 --> 39:24.960]  uh, you know
[39:24.960 --> 39:28.880]  Rules that are broken both ways, but for the most part. Yeah, I think that
[39:29.680 --> 39:34.080]  women's intuition is a prime example of of their ability to
[39:34.800 --> 39:40.100]  Feel uh on another level an energetic level that something's going to happen whether it's a premonition
[39:40.880 --> 39:44.260]  But I don't know about you guys, but every time I don't listen to my intuition
[39:44.880 --> 39:48.080]  I regret it. I seriously regret it. Oh, yeah
[39:48.480 --> 39:50.480]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
[39:51.520 --> 39:58.000]  And that's part of of uh, the process of growth is starting to to listen to that inner voice
[39:58.480 --> 40:02.000]  You guys had werner on um, the guy that does does the dowsing?
[40:02.640 --> 40:08.020]  Okay, that's listening to your energy your inner voice. That's that's part of that interconnection
[40:09.120 --> 40:14.720]  but when brian because he said oh, yeah, my my my wife is pregnant and I I
[40:15.280 --> 40:18.240]  Off off the top of the cuff because i'm the class clown
[40:18.720 --> 40:24.320]  Okay, I came out with the pickles and ice cream because you know, that's what everybody talks about with pregnant women
[40:25.200 --> 40:27.700]  But maybe there's something a little bit deeper
[40:29.360 --> 40:31.360]  That we're not even considering
[40:32.160 --> 40:36.500]  We were just talking about how each cell is is created by the microbiology
[40:38.000 --> 40:40.000]  Could it possibly be?
[40:40.240 --> 40:42.640]  It's the biology going excuse me
[40:43.360 --> 40:46.100]  In that pickle there's these particular
[40:46.940 --> 40:51.920]  Substances that I need to create healthy cells in your baby's body
[40:53.360 --> 40:56.340]  Your plant when it shows you a calcium deficiency
[40:57.200 --> 40:59.120]  You give it calcium
[40:59.120 --> 41:00.000]  well
[41:00.000 --> 41:03.600]  That's their expression. Maybe that's their I have a craving
[41:04.320 --> 41:08.880]  And that's their expression the wife. Of course, you know, she has a voice and she's gonna use it
[41:09.440 --> 41:15.760]  Okay, she's gonna say brian get your ass to the store because I want portobello mushrooms
[41:16.320 --> 41:23.520]  Maybe there's something that is in that portobello mushroom that the biology because it's had a portobello mushroom before
[41:24.560 --> 41:30.960]  Has looked at the portobello mushrooms genetic code and said, okay, there's this in that that I can use
[41:31.600 --> 41:35.040]  To create this type of cell, but if I don't have it
[41:35.760 --> 41:43.520]  I can't create it. So i'm gonna make this young lady crave this i'm gonna make the saliva run and i'm going to make her
[41:43.920 --> 41:47.120]  You know so intense that she's gotta have it
[41:48.080 --> 41:51.620]  Okay. Now my wife. I love her. She's a chocoholic
[41:52.720 --> 41:58.800]  Okay, and you do not get in between a woman and her chocolate guys. Okay, just a word of warning
[41:58.960 --> 41:59.840]  Okay
[41:59.840 --> 42:05.360]  Hey ken, I wanted to throw something in on that and I think I think you touched on something that's really
[42:05.920 --> 42:10.480]  Uh goes back to a lot of conversations we've had over the years who's in charge of your body
[42:12.720 --> 42:15.280]  Who the fuck's in charge you you really think you're in charge
[42:16.080 --> 42:18.080]  Or is it the cells?
[42:18.080 --> 42:20.960]  So, you know that craving is all of those cells
[42:22.460 --> 42:24.460]  communicating um
[42:25.500 --> 42:28.320]  Chemotaxis sending messages and signals to
[42:29.040 --> 42:31.040]  Create that craving
[42:31.760 --> 42:33.600]  Who's in charge man
[42:33.600 --> 42:35.600]  And who creates the cell?
[42:36.000 --> 42:38.880]  Who knows who's reading the genetic code guys?
[42:40.240 --> 42:42.240]  Because okay your liver
[42:42.720 --> 42:48.960]  Can regenerate and I it's it's months your brain cells take seven years our entire body
[42:50.140 --> 42:54.080]  Regenerates every seven years. So you're a new person
[42:54.880 --> 42:56.480]  Pardon me
[42:56.480 --> 43:03.520]  So you are a new person after every seven years is what we've talked about plenty of times the seven-year itch guys
[43:05.120 --> 43:06.240]  You know
[43:06.240 --> 43:09.280]  Are we a snake? We just shed our skin? No, man, you know
[43:10.160 --> 43:13.840]  But when you look at it from that point of view
[43:14.960 --> 43:17.040]  I heard reference to you know, uh
[43:17.680 --> 43:21.120]  The biology that is creating the cell looks at the cell beside it
[43:21.200 --> 43:24.720]  And oh that was an unhealthy cell and i'm going to create a mirror image
[43:25.680 --> 43:30.720]  Well, no that cell is unhealthy because it's missing something if you're building a house
[43:31.120 --> 43:34.080]  And you don't have the necessary two by fours to build the house
[43:34.800 --> 43:36.800]  You can't build a house
[43:37.680 --> 43:39.940]  But if you have the necessary
[43:41.580 --> 43:44.180]  Materials to build an igloo
[43:44.880 --> 43:51.040]  You know blocks of ice and snow that you create and as your shelter, then you can create that so
[43:51.680 --> 43:53.680]  Is everything that happens?
[43:55.200 --> 43:56.240]  More
[43:56.240 --> 43:59.520]  When you uh, the microbiology looks at the genetic code
[44:00.160 --> 44:02.160]  It has to pick
[44:02.540 --> 44:08.480]  Exactly what it is going to be able to express in our bodies and our plants bodies
[44:09.520 --> 44:15.760]  with the list of ingredients that it has in the soil and it has access to
[44:16.400 --> 44:21.920]  I i'm i have a massage therapist and right next door is this fantastic little burger joint
[44:22.400 --> 44:25.700]  But it's not your typical place, you know, you don't go in and you order a cheeseburger
[44:26.320 --> 44:31.040]  They have a sheet on the table and it lists all the ingredients that they have
[44:32.080 --> 44:35.840]  In the back for the cook to create your hamburger and you sit down you go
[44:35.920 --> 44:42.080]  Oh, yeah, I want tomatoes and pickles and to um, you know this that and the other thing I want kale today, you know
[44:42.160 --> 44:44.160]  or brown bread
[44:44.480 --> 44:49.040]  Are you actually connecting creating? Sorry the genetic code?
[44:49.600 --> 44:55.440]  Because you've you're reading the menu which is what the genetic code is and you're creating that hamburger from that list
[44:55.440 --> 44:57.440]  So are you creating?
[44:57.840 --> 45:00.880]  That burger and when you go and take that to the cook
[45:01.840 --> 45:04.960]  And he turned out I can see layton talking but you're muted buddy
[45:06.160 --> 45:09.440]  Oh, i'm, sorry. I'm talking to the dog trying to call. Okay, okay
[45:10.480 --> 45:14.080]  I just saw the lips moving, you know, and I didn't think you're a politician
[45:14.160 --> 45:18.160]  So, you know, I should be listening when the lips move, you know, no, I shouldn't block it. Oh
[45:18.240 --> 45:19.920]  anyway, so
[45:19.920 --> 45:23.760]  When you go up to the cook and you hand in this sheet, he's gonna look at and go
[45:23.760 --> 45:28.080]  Okay, I have all these ingredients then I was like, oh, sorry. I don't have mustard today
[45:29.840 --> 45:31.200]  Oh, well
[45:31.200 --> 45:35.600]  When I eat that hamburger i'm not gonna get that genetic expression because i'm not gonna get the flavor of mustard
[45:36.720 --> 45:40.720]  So if you want red in your soil, do you have to go out and find some red sand?
[45:41.280 --> 45:43.940]  Because it's got the particular molecules
[45:44.180 --> 45:46.180]  Particular molecules
[45:46.260 --> 45:52.340]  That can create that tint in your plant and if you don't have that you can't actually have that genetic
[45:53.280 --> 45:55.280]  profile express itself
[45:56.660 --> 46:03.080]  In your plant just like the cook couldn't create that hamburger with mustard in it because he didn't have the material
[46:03.540 --> 46:11.060]  The base material to create that when we start looking stepping back and looking at it in in these different ways
[46:12.020 --> 46:18.100]  These different expressions and I can't build a house if I don't have shingles on my roof because I can't finish it
[46:18.900 --> 46:25.880]  You know is that what's actually happening? It is what's in control of your life is your microbiology
[46:26.740 --> 46:28.740]  And you want to see extremes?
[46:28.900 --> 46:33.720]  NASA did a study at the international space station where they took a handful of biology
[46:34.420 --> 46:39.060]  And jumped in their spacesuit went out and stuck it on one of their their porthole windows
[46:39.540 --> 46:42.260]  When they went back I believe it was around a year later
[46:43.140 --> 46:47.300]  And scraped that off and brought it back in and brought it back up to temperature
[46:47.860 --> 46:50.980]  Holy fuck only the outside skin was dead
[46:51.540 --> 46:54.020]  Everything else that was inside of that
[46:54.660 --> 46:59.540]  Came out assist and went. Hey, baby. I'm in an environment. I like let's get to work
[47:00.500 --> 47:01.700]  so
[47:01.700 --> 47:03.140]  Layton's
[47:03.860 --> 47:05.620]  Uh possibility of you know
[47:05.620 --> 47:12.900]  The aliens flying by and and shitting on the planet to start things off or a meteor hitting that's exactly possible
[47:13.780 --> 47:14.740]  because
[47:14.740 --> 47:22.660]  That biology can live in space and the original biology that landed are on our planet landed in a pretty hostile environment
[47:23.700 --> 47:25.140]  so maybe
[47:25.140 --> 47:30.600]  The reason that there was only that one particular biology to start is it was the only one that could exist
[47:31.160 --> 47:33.160]  In that environment
[47:33.640 --> 47:40.120]  And it was we know that it was the biology that changed our environment to an oxygen-rich environment where we can exist
[47:40.600 --> 47:43.560]  Because that was the progression and science is showing that
[47:45.320 --> 47:46.520]  But
[47:46.520 --> 47:52.840]  Was the rest of it that landed in our planet still insist and could survive those?
[47:53.640 --> 47:57.240]  Environments and did it all come in one big package or?
[47:57.800 --> 47:59.000]  Or
[47:59.000 --> 48:07.240]  Was one grain of sand enough to hold the entire genetic code of every microbiology that came from the planet it came from
[48:08.360 --> 48:14.520]  And that whole genetic code for everything that happened on our in our planet is in every single
[48:15.320 --> 48:17.400]  cell of a sand molecule
[48:18.680 --> 48:24.840]  Genetic potential goes way back the human body. You're a representation of your mother and your father
[48:25.560 --> 48:30.120]  But you're also a representation of what your mother had to give to you
[48:30.680 --> 48:32.600]  from her own body
[48:32.600 --> 48:34.200]  To create you
[48:34.200 --> 48:39.880]  And maybe that's what the cravings are is I need more calcium. I need more magnesium or I need boron
[48:41.000 --> 48:43.400]  Layton have you ever heard the term quorum sensing?
[48:44.680 --> 48:47.560]  Hell, yeah, of course. We just talked about that yesterday
[48:48.280 --> 48:50.280]  Oh, that's the first time I ever heard of that
[48:50.280 --> 48:56.380]  Uh, yeah, I ran into it watching dr. David johnson, uh, explain his the johnson-sue bioreactor
[48:57.160 --> 49:02.120]  um, which actually is a cold compress and I can actually go in depth on on that and biochar and
[49:03.240 --> 49:05.580]  We won't go there right now because that's not the conversation
[49:06.280 --> 49:07.880]  but
[49:07.880 --> 49:08.840]  uh
[49:08.840 --> 49:14.120]  Quorum sensing in my basic understanding. Remember i'm not a scientist. I'm not a doctor
[49:14.680 --> 49:20.220]  You know, i'm a i'm a simple man i'm a country boy and I look at things on an overview
[49:21.000 --> 49:23.000]  my overview of quorum sensing is
[49:24.040 --> 49:28.040]  You get enough microbiology together that it forms a brain trust. So
[49:28.600 --> 49:33.160]  To give you an example of the brain trust, uh, layton craig and leaf
[49:33.880 --> 49:35.800]  That is a brain trust
[49:35.800 --> 49:42.460]  Okay, um, they've been doing experiments with with this kind of stuff. Um in the think tanks for decades
[49:43.100 --> 49:49.500]  And what they've found is the more brains you get into that room thinking about one particular problem
[49:50.220 --> 49:54.460]  It's not individual brains. It forms this big huge brain on top
[49:55.500 --> 50:01.420]  That's how I look at quorum sensing is there's enough microbiology builds up in the system
[50:02.060 --> 50:07.340]  Where it can start to go. Okay. I don't have this particular element
[50:07.900 --> 50:10.860]  I need to create that for the plant because she's asking for it
[50:11.820 --> 50:13.180]  Okay, or
[50:13.180 --> 50:19.260]  The biology that is building the cells in my plan is going look man. Uh, I need some boron, please
[50:19.500 --> 50:22.300]  Can somebody make me some boron because there's none in the soil?
[50:24.220 --> 50:25.340]  When I
[50:25.340 --> 50:27.500]  First heard quorum sensing it was like, uh, yeah
[50:27.580 --> 50:32.300]  Okay, you know I I kind of skipped by it because I had no conception of what the fuck it was
[50:33.340 --> 50:35.980]  but when I started to understand it it
[50:36.300 --> 50:40.940]  Activated a random memory in my brain and my brain is you don't want to go there
[50:42.620 --> 50:44.460]  It goes everywhere
[50:44.460 --> 50:47.340]  But I remember a study when I was studying tomatoes
[50:47.980 --> 50:50.780]  On guys that did a side by side and scientists
[50:50.860 --> 50:57.260]  So, you know, I I don't ask me for the white paper because I I wouldn't find it but they took. Um,
[50:58.060 --> 51:00.060]  the creditor potting soil
[51:00.140 --> 51:02.140]  And they had the two plants
[51:02.300 --> 51:08.860]  But in the one they stripped the molecules of boron out of the soil now if you don't know
[51:09.180 --> 51:11.500]  Uh tomato needs boron to be healthy
[51:12.220 --> 51:13.900]  So they did the side by side
[51:13.900 --> 51:19.660]  They planted the plants and they sat back and started watching the grass growing, you know playing cards whatever they were doing
[51:20.460 --> 51:26.220]  And as time progressed the the one that was in the soil with non-boron, of course was not doing very well
[51:26.300 --> 51:28.300]  The other one was growing normally
[51:28.860 --> 51:33.260]  At the end of the experiment when they put that soil into a spectral analysis machine
[51:34.300 --> 51:37.660]  They found that oh my god, there's boron in this soil
[51:39.020 --> 51:41.120]  The only way that it could be created
[51:42.300 --> 51:48.000]  Was by the microbiology did the microbiology have to get to a certain point where it could understand
[51:49.100 --> 51:51.100]  How to actually put that together
[51:51.980 --> 51:53.020]  or
[51:53.020 --> 52:00.220]  Did it have to get to a point where it could reach the genetic code to create the particular biology that could actually mine?
[52:00.300 --> 52:03.500]  That out of the sand silt clay and organic material
[52:04.620 --> 52:11.740]  You know when you get into into how it's creating something from nothing and this is not science fiction. This is science fact
[52:12.940 --> 52:16.620]  you know, um, you start to understand that you know
[52:17.180 --> 52:22.540]  As your soil is progressing. We always talk about how a living soil is always getting better
[52:23.260 --> 52:26.220]  It's expressing more. It's giving more back
[52:26.940 --> 52:33.200]  Is that a form of quorum sensing where you know when you first start you have these base elements?
[52:33.820 --> 52:40.220]  And as you put roots into the soil whether it's cannabis or grass or tomatoes or whatever
[52:41.100 --> 52:46.300]  The biology reads the genetic code realizes. Okay, we're short on x y and z
[52:46.540 --> 52:52.860]  So we're going to as we develop we're going to come together and form this brain trust
[52:53.420 --> 53:00.220]  and we're going to start to you know, either make the biology that can strip that or we're going to
[53:00.700 --> 53:03.900]  Take the the molecular weight of the atoms
[53:04.360 --> 53:10.620]  Combine them to create boron or the the the cell of boron. However, you want to phrase it
[53:11.180 --> 53:13.420]  Um, I think that may be more
[53:14.140 --> 53:20.140]  Along the lines of what's actually happening then we want to actually think about layton. Yep
[53:21.100 --> 53:23.660]  Let me touch on that. So basically it's bio
[53:24.440 --> 53:25.640]  geo
[53:25.640 --> 53:26.940]  chemistry
[53:26.940 --> 53:28.940]  This goes back to glomulin. All right
[53:29.160 --> 53:36.940]  Glomulin is going in in the hyphae and on the outside of the hyphae of a mycorrhizal fungi
[53:37.340 --> 53:39.340]  but as soon as it is excreted
[53:39.820 --> 53:46.300]  So, uh left the cell or left the body of the fungi it becomes
[53:47.740 --> 53:49.740]  They've got a term for it now
[53:49.800 --> 53:51.000]  glomulin
[53:51.000 --> 53:53.000]  related soil proteins
[53:53.500 --> 53:56.460]  so they're finally starting to get a handle on the fact that
[53:57.180 --> 53:59.900]  You can't call it glomulin in the soil. It's got iron
[53:59.980 --> 54:05.600]  It's got all these other things in it now that it didn't have when it was inside the hyphae of the mycorrhizae
[54:06.380 --> 54:08.780]  So it goes back to exactly what you're talking about
[54:09.560 --> 54:10.880]  bio
[54:10.880 --> 54:14.080]  geochemical reactions that are allowing different
[54:15.020 --> 54:17.020]  microbes to pull different
[54:17.240 --> 54:19.240]  electrons and different
[54:19.260 --> 54:21.760]  protons off of different components
[54:22.300 --> 54:28.860]  Molecules that will then rebound to something else that shit gets really crazy really fast and we are just just
[54:29.480 --> 54:34.300]  Scratching the surface you talk about knowing one percent of what's going on. You're talking about
[54:35.180 --> 54:37.500]  Fractions of fractions of fractions of less
[54:39.100 --> 54:41.100]  Oh, yeah
[54:41.100 --> 54:44.060]  Stay tuned for that one. And you know, it's funny that
[54:44.700 --> 54:49.980]  We're supposed to be talking about the rhizosphere, right? And I actually brought a show and tell in today
[54:49.980 --> 54:52.460]  We'll get to when we get back to your slides
[54:55.020 --> 54:57.020]  It's gonna be a long day
[54:57.020 --> 54:59.020]  I feel like I'm the highest dude in the room today
[54:59.020 --> 55:02.700]  Maybe I could go on for days. Okay, I'm sorry guys, but you know
[55:02.700 --> 55:05.380]  It's just I have so much in this Oh
[55:06.060 --> 55:12.780]  Little old trucker brain that I have studied and I can share and and we're talking like everything from energy to building
[55:13.340 --> 55:16.860]  Sciences and how you can take I I'm in Canada
[55:16.860 --> 55:22.220]  Of course, I can't really do an outside grow because I'm in Alberta and you know, we just went through you know
[55:22.220 --> 55:27.020]  Minus 35 Celsius. Let me look that's what oh, yeah
[55:27.580 --> 55:31.860]  It matches at 32 minus 32. Okay, so 32 degrees
[55:31.940 --> 55:37.460]  Fahrenheit is 32 degrees Celsius guys. So it was bloody freaking cold. Okay
[55:38.260 --> 55:42.260]  It's pretty hard to grow inside of that. So I have an indoor grow and
[55:43.140 --> 55:49.460]  You know to maintain the temperature. I had to go down this building science route and and try to figure out
[55:49.460 --> 55:55.220]  Okay, how can I make it so that it's not costing me a thousand dollars a month for the small little grow?
[55:55.220 --> 55:59.300]  You know just to grow my mat my medicine, you know like my god
[55:59.300 --> 56:06.580]  You know like my god, so I I went down those rabbit holes and and I I know shit that you know could really help a lot of
[56:06.580 --> 56:11.380]  Guys setting up your grows on how to be able to maintain the vapor pressure deficit
[56:11.380 --> 56:13.380]  Your heat your cooling
[56:13.380 --> 56:20.980]  There I I understand how to heat a 3,000 square foot house with the element from a freaking hair dryer guys
[56:21.700 --> 56:25.380]  Okay, and you can do it. It's easy. They're doing it right now
[56:25.380 --> 56:27.380]  You know, so
[56:28.020 --> 56:32.420]  Let's let's get back to the next slide before Brian goes. Hey you guys come on
[56:33.140 --> 56:37.860]  No, your wife's right there for bathroom cleaning your pipe. How'd you get that slide up so quick?
[56:39.940 --> 56:44.500]  They're going oh, yeah, man, I I don't have any seeds to put in here right now
[56:46.500 --> 56:49.460]  And he's loading seeds and I I love that guy because
[56:49.620 --> 56:57.620]  I wish I wish I did but I I don't but anyway, um late and you could probably actually pronounce that that name for
[56:58.180 --> 57:01.220]  This particular micro biology a lot better than I could
[57:02.340 --> 57:04.340]  What bio precipitation?
[57:04.900 --> 57:09.380]  No, pseudomonas. Uh serengeti. Oh, they're a badass one, man
[57:10.100 --> 57:12.100]  Yeah, did they live in the desert?
[57:12.660 --> 57:14.660]  Yeah, they live in the desert
[57:15.140 --> 57:18.020]  Serengeti. Oh, they're a badass one, man
[57:18.660 --> 57:22.260]  Yeah, do they live they live in every single environment on our planet?
[57:22.340 --> 57:27.700]  They live in the air in the in the ground and in the water and they're actually what creates rain
[57:28.340 --> 57:33.320]  Uh, they're actually, um incredible at breaking down very very complex
[57:34.500 --> 57:36.500]  molecules into atoms
[57:36.580 --> 57:38.580]  so they're they're very much a
[57:39.040 --> 57:41.060]  critical component of life
[57:41.140 --> 57:48.420]  And if you are any way compromised in your health and you get around too many pseudomonas they will
[57:49.680 --> 57:51.140]  amplify
[57:51.140 --> 57:53.140]  your illness and and again, it's like
[57:53.860 --> 57:57.080]  Many I I really believe that this particular
[57:58.400 --> 58:05.700]  Bacteria is is the big correction or or the great corrector. So if something gets out of whack it takes it out
[58:06.420 --> 58:08.420]  um, you know like like bugs
[58:09.380 --> 58:11.380]  Bugs are here to
[58:11.540 --> 58:16.420]  Take out plants that are not healthy enough for the consumers. That's their job
[58:16.980 --> 58:20.900]  and I think in many ways pseudomonas is here on this planet to
[58:21.620 --> 58:22.960]  like
[58:22.960 --> 58:24.260]  viruses
[58:24.260 --> 58:28.500]  When shit gets out of balance take it the fuck out take it out of the picture
[58:28.580 --> 58:35.320]  It got out of control and I think I think in many ways, uh, eventually whether it's a zombie apocalypse
[58:35.700 --> 58:37.700]  Whether it's a virus or whatever
[58:37.780 --> 58:41.540]  Uh humans will will suffer the same fate as as you know
[58:42.020 --> 58:45.780]  um, perhaps the plant that the bugs all attack but
[58:46.340 --> 58:48.340]  To be to be determined
[58:48.340 --> 58:55.540]  Yeah, oh, yeah, and and right now I look at it. We are in the zombie apocalypse right now because there's so many people that
[58:55.940 --> 58:58.260]  aren't uh aware enough and and
[58:58.740 --> 58:58.980]  You know
[58:58.980 --> 59:04.260]  They only look at at one aspect and they're living in such fear that they're doing things that they would never
[59:04.900 --> 59:07.380]  Ever do if they weren't in that fear mode
[59:07.940 --> 59:13.860]  And they as far as i'm concerned a lot of those people have become zombies because they only do what they're told to do
[59:14.740 --> 59:16.740]  But that's just my personal opinion
[59:17.620 --> 59:20.840]  But we'll get back to to to uh pseudomonas here
[59:24.980 --> 59:31.540]  How many slides do we have just just so we can project out how far how long this podcast is gonna be it was pretty deep
[59:31.620 --> 59:33.620]  That's why
[59:33.620 --> 59:35.620]  20 20 and we're on
[59:37.460 --> 59:38.900]  Five
[59:38.900 --> 59:44.420]  I think this is six actually, but anyway, go ahead. Let's let's hit on this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So anyway
[59:45.060 --> 59:50.180]  water freezes, uh pure water freezes at minus 35 unless you add
[59:50.580 --> 59:58.500]  A particle of dust or or something like that and then it freezes at minus 30 or minus 17 c
[59:59.300 --> 01:00:00.580]  Okay
[01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:04.180]  But if you add this particular baby into it
[01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:06.740]  they can actually
[01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:08.980]  Make that freeze at minus 2 c
[01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:13.860]  Now in the atmosphere as you go up it gets colder and colder and colder
[01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:19.780]  So in order for water to freeze and rain back down on of it on us if it's pure water
[01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:24.120]  It's got to go way up until it hits that minus 35 before it can condense
[01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:29.300]  And rain back down on us if it has some sand, of course, it's minus 17
[01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:34.280]  But if it's got this beautiful little baby microbe in it that it grabs that molecule
[01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:36.580]  And goes hey, man
[01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:38.580]  Let I want to rain down on you
[01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:45.300]  If we don't have this particular biology folks, we don't have rain. We don't have weather
[01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:47.380]  You know
[01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:49.460]  When it's supposed to rain it ain't gonna rain
[01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:52.180]  Okay, because this biology
[01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:57.400]  It allows the molecules of hydrogen and oxygen
[01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:04.440]  To form into rain at a much lower temperature so it's not blowing off and away
[01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:08.120]  when your water comes off of the lake
[01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:09.640]  now
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:14.040]  You guys mentioned this a little bit on heat plumes and and weather
[01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:21.240]  um around a lake like I I live i'm surrounded by lakes here and i'm also have a river that's close and we can watch
[01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:27.240]  The clouds coming out of the north and you'll see when it reaches the river because the direction of the clouds
[01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:29.800]  Is going to change
[01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:35.560]  And it's the same when when clouds, uh meet, um, a large water body
[01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:39.240]  Okay, that is over land not in the ocean
[01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:43.800]  But when it hits that water body, there's a difference in pressure there
[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:46.920]  Oh, maybe vapor pressure deficit guys
[01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:50.360]  You know, it's it's all a function of nature
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.400]  Okay, so the cloud can actually come over
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:59.720]  And and rain down on you because it's being blocked by this this ridge of of you know
[01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:05.880]  Heated air especially in the cities. You can see the the chemical plume around a city
[01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:07.640]  Okay
[01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:08.820]  this
[01:02:08.820 --> 01:02:10.280]  biology
[01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:13.960]  um takes a part of that out of the equation because
[01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:21.880]  It can actually make it draw those molecules from that heat plume and make them freeze and then you get rain
[01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:24.440]  And you know, we all need water
[01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:30.380]  You know, um and and water is another topic living water and some of the experiments
[01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:34.280]  um are absolutely amazing a japanese, uh,
[01:02:34.820 --> 01:02:40.600]  professor put out um three glasses of water and with a little bit of rice in each one
[01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:46.440]  And this goes back actually more to energy side but what he would do is every morning
[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:49.480]  He'd look at the one and say I love you
[01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:55.640]  You're beautiful and he put positive energy into it the one which is was his control. He just left
[01:02:55.960 --> 01:03:02.680]  Okay, the other one any anger that he could feel he would pour into that to get it out of himself
[01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:05.560]  at the end of the experiment
[01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:12.040]  The one where he gave love and positive energy to turned into the sweetest rice wine he had ever tasted
[01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:14.440]  The middle one it just went moldy
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000]  The one he projected hate at though
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:23.480]  You would want to go there was black it was ugly it was almost looking mean
[01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:28.440]  Emotions do have an effect when you go into your garden
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:34.760]  You want the right emotions layton understands this from when he was doing his his lab work with dr
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:37.500]  elaine and you know thursday thursday
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:43.480]  And friday morning and he's going well, you're telling me this is bad. I haven't seen bad yet
[01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:48.040]  So I want power. I want to see what's bad and he looks at it and
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:50.760]  There's nothing bad there. He's
[01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:56.920]  He's seeing a totally different aspect because his energy is better. That's why you always want to ground yourself
[01:03:57.380 --> 01:04:01.020]  Before you do say mushrooms or lsd
[01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:04.220]  You want to protect who you are
[01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:11.820]  And make sure that your connection to you and your body isn't disrupted. That's what a coma is guys. How many guys?
[01:04:12.620 --> 01:04:19.100]  You know wake up from a coma going I could see and hear everything you guys were saying. I just couldn't connect with my body
[01:04:19.980 --> 01:04:21.740]  to say anything
[01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:28.540]  You've been separated from your microbiology. Your energy has been separated from this physical form that we exist as
[01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:30.940]  Because this this this isn't me
[01:04:31.740 --> 01:04:35.900]  What's me is this energy that surrounds me I go to sleep
[01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:42.780]  The microbiology starts fixing any cell that it needs to fix it starts growing new cells same in your plant
[01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:47.180]  You know your plant grows a new leaf at night. It doesn't grow it during the day during the day
[01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:50.060]  It's taking those photons and turning that into
[01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:52.700]  elaine say caking cookies
[01:04:53.100 --> 01:04:55.100]  You know, it's feeding simple sugars
[01:04:55.820 --> 01:04:57.740]  okay, but
[01:04:57.740 --> 01:05:02.620]  We're gonna get back brian. We're gonna get back to the slides. Okay, uh next slide, please
[01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:06.300]  I know I I'm bad. I'm bad
[01:05:07.180 --> 01:05:08.380]  okay, so
[01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:13.440]  Dr. Robert johnson the the gentleman that uh developed johnson's to bioreactor
[01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:20.860]  Uh, a lot of these slides are actually from one of his presentations and anybody that wants to to understand this stuff can go watch
[01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:27.020]  He's the scientist. Okay. I'm just i'm just uh giving all credit to him and dr
[01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:32.300]  Elaine because there's stuff in here. That's from dr. Elaine's presentations that um, I I've
[01:05:33.260 --> 01:05:38.060]  I won't say stolen. I'll say I borrowed and I do give good uh full credit to
[01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:41.520]  uh historical essential mineral depletion
[01:05:43.260 --> 01:05:45.740]  This is what is in our plants
[01:05:46.940 --> 01:05:49.280]  uh from the study from 1940 to 1991
[01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:53.260]  Now you can see that there's a lot of stuff
[01:05:53.740 --> 01:05:55.660]  at the baseline
[01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:56.860]  that
[01:05:56.860 --> 01:05:58.860]  Is lacking in our food
[01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:04.640]  Now we understand in especially in this community
[01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:06.860]  you know that
[01:06:06.860 --> 01:06:11.360]  um, if we're not giving the the plant the a the biology
[01:06:12.380 --> 01:06:13.580]  and b
[01:06:13.580 --> 01:06:19.580]  The right minerals and nutrients in the soil that she can't produce the way she should produce
[01:06:20.780 --> 01:06:24.220]  When we spray those chemicals on our fields, this is the result
[01:06:25.180 --> 01:06:26.300]  now
[01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:27.740]  I don't blame
[01:06:27.740 --> 01:06:32.780]  Anybody I don't blame the farmer. I don't blame the guy that's selling it to him
[01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:37.180]  I blame the suit that's at the top that knows what the they're doing
[01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:44.220]  For doing this to us, you know, the world horror organization says we've got 30 to 50 years left to topsoil
[01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:46.700]  Um, i've heard as low as 20
[01:06:47.580 --> 01:06:53.580]  But before you guys go into fear that we're all going to die because the soil is is being depleted this fast
[01:06:54.460 --> 01:06:56.460]  Do you guys realize that
[01:06:57.100 --> 01:06:59.100]  this community
[01:06:59.100 --> 01:07:04.300]  um actually has the keys to healing our planet and can actually um
[01:07:05.420 --> 01:07:08.860]  Take it from dirt to soil in one growing season
[01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:14.560]  You guys are our salvation the knowledge that you hold on how to make a compost
[01:07:15.100 --> 01:07:17.180]  How to take that compost to the next level
[01:07:17.740 --> 01:07:23.580]  And then how to break that into a slurry that you can spray on your plant or spray on a field
[01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:28.380]  We have and you have the ability to save our planet
[01:07:28.940 --> 01:07:32.700]  With what the knowledge that you guys possess right at this exact moment
[01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:36.060]  okay, um, this is
[01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:38.860]  the beginning of
[01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:45.120]  Their ending because we're learning this we're seeing events on our planet and disseminating
[01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:48.160]  Information that they have hidden from us and
[01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:50.460]  This is some of that
[01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:52.460]  Information that i'm trying to share
[01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:58.480]  Not because nobody's ever seen it because nobody's looked at it from the particular angle
[01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:02.560]  that maybe i'm looking at it from and and I need your guys's help because
[01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:06.960]  I I might be totally out to lunch on some of this stuff
[01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:13.520]  Okay, and that's where you know, I I love layton because he's gonna jump on go. Yo doom cuff. No, no, no
[01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:15.520]  You got that all wrong
[01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:19.840]  Okay, and and that's what I need because that's how i'm going to grow and learn as well
[01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:22.740]  But so to just understand
[01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:25.600]  the lack
[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:27.600]  of the the different, um
[01:08:28.220 --> 01:08:30.220]  materials in our soil
[01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:35.760]  That we need to ingest in our body to create healthy soil or sorry healthy cells
[01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:42.240]  And the plants need to create healthy cells in their body, which we consume and the animals consume
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:45.120]  How do you get a healthy animal feed them healthy plants?
[01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:48.160]  If you don't have healthy plants and you're feeding that animal
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:51.840]  How the fuck are you going to get anything good out of that animal if there's nothing there?
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:56.960]  From the plant to give to the animal. They're not going to produce it out out of the thin air
[01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:00.320]  It needs to be there to start the cycle
[01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:05.680]  And you can see right now that what we have in our soil sucks
[01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:07.680]  bad
[01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:11.860]  But we in this community and in others like us in the permaculture
[01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:15.380]  And in those fields that are really starting to understand
[01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:21.520]  And using the microbiology not just throwing hot compost on the ground and hoping
[01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:23.120]  Okay
[01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:26.320]  um, we understand and we can you know
[01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:30.240]  Find somebody that has an old crop duster
[01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:34.900]  And we can load that crop duster with a shit ton of microbiology
[01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:38.640]  And he can cover a huge volume of area
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:40.960]  Oh, right
[01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:42.960]  Aren't they doing that already layton?
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:45.440]  something about chem trails
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:51.760]  But I don't think they're putting stuff that's going to help us because that's not what they are all about. They're about the money
[01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:56.320]  We know that you know, we've been down this road far enough
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:59.040]  where we understand that
[01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:03.440]  Really if you look deep enough guys, they're trying to kill us
[01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:09.620]  Okay, everything that they do is harming the human species
[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:12.320]  And they have the science
[01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:18.320]  Okay, because they have in in the military. They had those blow-up casts that you see now
[01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:21.040]  They had those 20 years
[01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:23.680]  before they came out into the
[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:25.760]  our world
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:30.640]  You know, they were using that stuff they've researched all this stuff. They know what the hell is going on
[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:34.720]  They just don't want us to know because if enough of us figure it out
[01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:40.960]  Oh, man, baby. That's what's happening right now and we're standing up and we're going no
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:44.320]  We don't want you
[01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:50.080]  Oh, sorry, i'm gonna stop right there. I'm i'm gonna get into trouble. Okay. All right
[01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:54.240]  What was that laden I said, okay next slide
[01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:59.200]  Oh believe me I I know stuff guys that
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:04.320]  You know would just I I'm not gonna go there. I'm not gonna i'm not gonna do it. Okay
[01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:07.920]  Humans and microbiology one car what?
[01:11:08.940 --> 01:11:10.940]  trillion resident viruses
[01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:14.240]  Make up your body
[01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:18.480]  Aren't we supposed to be afraid of all these viruses? Oh, man, they're gonna kill us
[01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:26.160]  Viruses. Oh, man, they're all in us already. Just like those cancer cells that unless your body gets so out of balance
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:30.480]  And and and become active they're there
[01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:35.040]  Everything's there the genetic potential is there
[01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:43.760]  You know, we only have 10 trillion human cells compared to 90 trillion microbial cells
[01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:46.560]  Who are you?
[01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:53.700]  Layton buddy, you just look like this, but you're biology man. You're just a sack of freaking microbes
[01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:56.640]  But that's all my soul. Hey brother
[01:11:57.840 --> 01:11:59.680]  next slide
[01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:01.680]  Peter please
[01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:05.360]  Okay human genes
[01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:10.080]  You see that little red blob on the bottom of his foot
[01:12:11.420 --> 01:12:13.420]  20 000 human genes
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:16.160]  How many microbial genes are there?
[01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:20.320]  Now we say okay in the human cell we have this
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:24.240]  You know map of who we are our our dna
[01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:26.880]  our genetic profile
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:30.480]  Well, there ain't much of us in there guys. It's mainly
[01:12:31.260 --> 01:12:32.560]  microbes
[01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:33.920]  you know
[01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:35.200]  I mean like
[01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:41.680]  Look at the dna. Look look at the scientific data that has been given to us going. Uh, we're just a little
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:43.600]  bleep
[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:49.040]  When you start realizing that you and your life expectancy to a mountain
[01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:51.680]  You're here, but a moment
[01:12:51.980 --> 01:12:53.920]  microbiology
[01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:59.860]  Their time span as we understand it is they're going through thousands of generations
[01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:02.000]  in a week
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.840]  I've heard 10 000 now latin latin is going to be able to speak to that
[01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:09.300]  In a lot more depth than I can but my understanding
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:12.260]  Is you know 10 000 generations?
[01:13:13.140 --> 01:13:20.340]  Uh in a week, do you think that in that 10 000 generations they can't figure out a um, you know a cold
[01:13:21.060 --> 01:13:23.060]  a flu
[01:13:23.300 --> 01:13:25.300]  They're 90 or well
[01:13:26.100 --> 01:13:30.500]  Science is saying 50 to 80 and there's a slide coming up on that but there's
[01:13:32.660 --> 01:13:34.500]  Our immune system
[01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:38.420]  They said it was 50 controlled by a biology in our body now
[01:13:38.420 --> 01:13:42.980]  They're up to 80 and I would say it's probably a shitload higher than that
[01:13:44.180 --> 01:13:48.180]  And if we give our body the right nutrients, we don't get sick. I I haven't been
[01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:52.500]  sick with like a flu or a cold in
[01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:55.600]  probably eight years
[01:13:56.100 --> 01:14:00.680]  Now i've physically damaged myself, you know, but you know, that's just my own stupidity
[01:14:02.180 --> 01:14:03.140]  You know
[01:14:03.140 --> 01:14:05.220]  but as far as an illness
[01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:11.620]  I've fed my body as healthy as I can and i'm not susceptible to most of what's out there
[01:14:12.260 --> 01:14:18.180]  Because i'm giving the biology what it needs to create white blood cells, etc, etc, etc
[01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:23.860]  And if it reads if you get um a particular bacteria in your system
[01:14:24.260 --> 01:14:30.260]  And your microbiology looks at it and reads its genetic code. Is it going to be looking for?
[01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:32.900]  those parts that it can
[01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:35.200]  Interfere with
[01:14:35.380 --> 01:14:40.180]  Or is it going to create a new biology to fight against that in a specific way?
[01:14:40.180 --> 01:14:43.700]  Is it going to twist your white blood cell just that little bit?
[01:14:44.340 --> 01:14:45.860]  to be able to
[01:14:45.860 --> 01:14:48.280]  fit fight that bacteria in a specific
[01:14:50.980 --> 01:14:52.500]  I don't know
[01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:54.420]  I actually don't know
[01:14:54.420 --> 01:14:57.300]  Okay. Um, we'll take the next screen
[01:14:57.860 --> 01:15:00.580]  Um, but I will go on a a little offshoot
[01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:06.980]  On that actually, no, I won't I won't I won't i'll stay away from that. Okay, so
[01:15:09.620 --> 01:15:11.460]  Cell renewal
[01:15:11.460 --> 01:15:16.420]  You uh ingest food you get nutrient generation you get vitamin, uh,
[01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:21.860]  Synthesization or i'm not pronouncing that but synthesis is the wife is telling me
[01:15:22.580 --> 01:15:24.580]  But the one that I really like
[01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:25.860]  Okay
[01:15:25.860 --> 01:15:31.060]  Is that one up on the top right where it said? Oh, it was 60 percent. Sorry on the immune system
[01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:33.700]  I was saying 50 now they're saying 80
[01:15:34.740 --> 01:15:42.660]  You know, but look at that one in the middle on the the center turn off off and on our genes
[01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:46.420]  Okay, so they're the ones controlling our genes
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:53.400]  regulating brain development anxiety depression autism arthritis and emotional behavior
[01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:56.600]  Uh, who's in control of you buddy
[01:15:57.960 --> 01:16:03.160]  Uh looks like the microbiology is the one that's uh doing most of the work and you're just there
[01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:07.160]  Maybe just to feed the microbiology what it's craving
[01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:15.480]  Is your plant in the same situation? Is it just feeding that cake and cookies because that's what it can create
[01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:22.120]  But it's the biology that's reading the genetic potential of the plant and going. Okay. I don't have onions
[01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:25.660]  So I can't express that particular genetic
[01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:31.480]  From this seed or from the mother plant and the father plant and probably mr
[01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:36.120]  Toad could speak a lot better on that than I i'll ever be able to because I've never bred
[01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:39.640]  I've only actually grown one strain and that was sour diesel
[01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:42.680]  And I actually don't smoke to get high
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:49.720]  I actually decarboxylate to to remove the bulk of the thc to be left with the cbd make a powder
[01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:51.880]  So i'm taking a whole plant
[01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:55.960]  Um, and that's how i've been able to get rid of the the cramping in my back
[01:16:56.920 --> 01:16:59.320]  but when you start looking at it of
[01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:07.000]  Really who's in control? It doesn't really look like um, we're that much in control other than you know, somebody like mr
[01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:15.400]  Toad who takes that particular male with the expressions he wants and takes that particular female with the expressions that he wants
[01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:17.400]  puts them together
[01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:18.920]  and then
[01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:26.760]  His energy is actually projected into the plant and if he's working on somebody that's very specific for an ailment
[01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:29.640]  his energy
[01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:35.960]  Is communicating to that plant is i'm looking for these genetic expressions from my plant
[01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:39.560]  To be able to help this particular ailment
[01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:43.800]  Now that's going into the metaphysical and you know the woo-woo stuff
[01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:48.200]  But hey, guess what the aura was woo-woo not that long ago
[01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:55.320]  Science fiction becomes science fact the more the science begins to understand and the more they develop the uh,
[01:17:55.940 --> 01:17:58.600]  technology that they can actually see and it's like
[01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:06.120]  We all know that technology is is coming but it's rather slow and a lot of like, uh, uh
[01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:10.440]  the people that you've had on um in pauline's um
[01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:18.320]  Sorry, um in the celebration of pauline's life you had a doctor on
[01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:21.120]  And he talked to that
[01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:24.320]  Okay, um that
[01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:28.640]  This stuff has been out there, but they've been suppressing it
[01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:33.280]  Dr. Elaine ingham has been talking about this for 45 bloody years
[01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:35.520]  but
[01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:39.760]  The world health organization says we've only got this much longer to live
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:43.760]  Why isn't that on
[01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:50.240]  Every news station, why isn't it the lead story in every bloody paper that look we're killing ourselves
[01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:52.560]  And this is this is you know the problem
[01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:55.520]  Oh, no, it's global warming
[01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:59.040]  Oh, no, look over here folks. No. No, no, don't look at reality
[01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:06.080]  Look over here. You want to understand global warming go to nasa's website and look up the inuit elders report to nasa
[01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:10.400]  It explains global warming in a very simple way
[01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:15.760]  See the people up north they have six months daylight. They have six months of darkness
[01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:18.880]  Okay, they live at the top of the world. They live at the arctic circle
[01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:22.160]  Okay. Now, uh, it's not true darkness
[01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:27.360]  Okay, the sun doesn't just doesn't come up in the winter time all the way you just have a twilight
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:33.840]  How do I know that because I've spent hundreds of hours driving through it? Okay, because I used to run up north
[01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:40.260]  Okay, and in the summer you don't have complete darkness because the sun goes below the horizon, but you still have twilight
[01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:42.800]  That's why they say that
[01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:45.280]  They have 24 hours of sunlight
[01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:48.420]  These people are so in tune with their environment
[01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:53.920]  That if they get an extra five minutes a year in daylight, they write it down
[01:19:54.960 --> 01:20:02.400]  Okay, they sent this report to nasa and they said guys, um, the ice sheet that you're talking about melting hasn't melted
[01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:04.960]  It has moved
[01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:09.140]  It has moved hundreds of miles from where it has existed
[01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:14.480]  Since we started keeping our records and guess what we're getting more
[01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:18.720]  Minutes and hours of daylight than we ever have before
[01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:21.520]  their conclusion to nasa
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.520]  was
[01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:25.780]  It has nothing to do with co2
[01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:30.080]  It has everything to do with when our planet was knocked off
[01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:34.880]  Its 90 degree access and has been leaning in that 20 22 degrees, whatever it is
[01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:37.920]  It's coming back
[01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:40.080]  Now if you think about
[01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:42.720]  That and that planet coming back to 90
[01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:47.600]  Where you live in the world if you took a globe and and took it off
[01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:51.520]  It's it's mounting which they have it leaned over and you took it back to 90
[01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:54.160]  Where are you going to be?
[01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:56.160]  Are you going to be in a mediterranean zone?
[01:20:57.040 --> 01:20:59.040]  and if so if
[01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:01.920]  Alberta is going to all of a sudden become
[01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:04.320]  on the same
[01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:07.040]  zone or plane as say
[01:21:07.660 --> 01:21:09.360]  athens, greece
[01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:11.360]  Is that going to change my weather?
[01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:13.200]  Yeah
[01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:15.040]  Of course it is
[01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:17.120]  Is the function of the planet going back?
[01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:24.080]  Uh a product of all of the volcanoes that have been blasting off here there and everywhere around our planet
[01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:29.440]  Creating a ripple effect of like throwing the pebble in the pond and you get these ripples
[01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:37.120]  Is those pressure waves and and they talked about this tonga volcano and the pressure wave that went around our planet?
[01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:42.240]  Did that just kick us back a couple more miles into 90 degrees?
[01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:48.960]  Is that the reality of global warming or climate change? I know in the 70s when I was in school
[01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:54.640]  They were talking about a bloody ice age and then they switched to climate change and the temperatures are riding and
[01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:59.280]  Aren't the uh cities on the coast supposed to be totally underwater by now?
[01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:02.340]  Wasn't that like five or seven years ago? They were supposed to be underwater
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.560]  Yeah, okay climate change exists, um
[01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:15.280]  I don't know if everybody's ever looked and and I personally haven't but how much co2 did tonga kick out into the atmosphere when it popped?
[01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:16.960]  I
[01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:19.440]  Bet you it was a fuck ton more
[01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:24.560]  Than what we have ever put in from the industrial revolution to now
[01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:29.680]  We don't do anything to the climate we're little ants
[01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:32.320]  We're the bacteria
[01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:34.080]  on this planet
[01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:36.740]  Okay, we're just here to supply
[01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:40.320]  Our nutrients back to the planet when we die
[01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:47.520]  You know ashes to ashes dust to dust you return your not only your biology
[01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:53.360]  But everything that made the cells in your body back to the system. That's why we compost
[01:22:54.080 --> 01:22:57.760]  That's why we cut it, you know, uh grow and uh, uh
[01:22:58.400 --> 01:23:03.040]  Cut and drop geez my brains froze there and i'm not even high damn it
[01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:05.840]  Okay
[01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:08.820]  So when you look at it from that perspective
[01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:11.680]  okay, that
[01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:17.600]  Everything is interconnected and oh, I think peter's telling me to get back to my slides and shut them up, you know
[01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:25.920]  Okay, i'll i'll stop there. But look look at things from a different angle guys because we're we're so focused over here
[01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:29.680]  That we're not seeing what's over there and we need to see what's over there
[01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:35.920]  So we can understand what the hell is happening here and fix the problem and I got one quick side
[01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:38.880]  Side note is if you have a problem
[01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:47.280]  Find out what the fucking cause is because when you eliminate that cause guess what you got no fucking problem anymore
[01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:51.520]  Think about that folks get rid of the causes of the problems
[01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:53.920]  anyway, so
[01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:55.920]  The next side slide peter
[01:23:56.880 --> 01:23:58.960]  I'm, sorry guys. I I know I go everywhere
[01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:07.040]  So weeds all leaf would fucking kick my ass for this slide because I didn't use early transitional plants
[01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:12.320]  Okay, but what can weeds what can they tell us about our soil now?
[01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:18.400]  This is my favorite dandelion. You can make wine from it. You can make tea from it
[01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:22.400]  You can use the flower. You can use the leaf you can use the the root
[01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:25.600]  but for the soil
[01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:29.120]  A dandelion is going to do one of two things
[01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:32.640]  It's going to tell you a you have compacted soil
[01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:37.680]  It's so freaking tight that I gotta put this big ass root down there to break things up
[01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:40.640]  Or it's going to tell you
[01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:42.720]  You have a lack of calcium
[01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:45.360]  in your soil
[01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:48.560]  And when you add enough calcium back into it
[01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:54.340]  The dandelions actually disappear. They don't come up because they don't need to they just go back into homeostasis
[01:24:55.120 --> 01:25:01.300]  And live in the soil until the conditions are right and they uh, your soil either needs calcium or gets compacted
[01:25:01.780 --> 01:25:07.300]  And it's the rain that does most of the compaction not not, you know, you're walking on it or driving on that soil
[01:25:07.620 --> 01:25:11.060]  it's having nothing there to break the the
[01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:15.060]  tension of that water as it's coming in at
[01:25:15.860 --> 01:25:21.800]  Uh, what do they call it when they jump out of an airplane? Um, and they reach the the terminal velocity
[01:25:23.220 --> 01:25:26.580]  Uh is the term thanks Layton. I know you had it buddy. I saw you reach it
[01:25:27.220 --> 01:25:35.540]  Anyway, it's terminal velocity now, that's 200 and some miles an hour if I remember right and I could be totally out to lunch on the number
[01:25:35.620 --> 01:25:42.500]  but it's hitting with such a force just thinking of the human body or or uh, you know, you you take a
[01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:46.820]  Watermelon drop it off a building when it hits that bottom. It's
[01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:49.540]  splat
[01:25:49.540 --> 01:25:52.180]  So when that rain comes down and hits your soil
[01:25:52.820 --> 01:25:56.420]  It's compacting it at 200 and some miles an hour
[01:25:57.540 --> 01:26:00.020]  and it's going splat and the
[01:26:00.740 --> 01:26:06.660]  Cell structure is going. Oh, oh, oh quit hitting me quit hitting me. But if you have a plant there
[01:26:08.100 --> 01:26:11.080]  And you have a leaf there that's breaking the velocity
[01:26:13.220 --> 01:26:18.660]  Then it's not compacting your soil and you don't have to worry about soil compaction that was a side note next slide
[01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:20.740]  I I don't even know where I am right now
[01:26:21.460 --> 01:26:23.460]  On those slides right now
[01:26:23.700 --> 01:26:25.700]  Uh, okay. Yeah, right
[01:26:25.780 --> 01:26:32.660]  Um, so we understand that weeds can actually teach us, you know, you can look and and figure it out now
[01:26:33.940 --> 01:26:35.540]  here you have
[01:26:35.540 --> 01:26:37.060]  uh, dr
[01:26:37.060 --> 01:26:39.060]  david or robert johnson, I
[01:26:39.540 --> 01:26:45.540]  Having a a brain fart on that and his his wife. Um, sue like sue lynn or something like that
[01:26:46.260 --> 01:26:50.980]  And uh, they're standing beside the johnson-sue bioreactor that they created
[01:26:51.860 --> 01:26:56.260]  And I I can go into this in an in in depth of why um,
[01:26:57.460 --> 01:27:00.100]  Dr. Johnson's wife said okay. I i'm
[01:27:00.660 --> 01:27:02.020]  Sick of you
[01:27:02.020 --> 01:27:08.020]  Turning those piles of compost because he started actually out with windrow. Um and working with the cattle manure
[01:27:08.740 --> 01:27:11.860]  And his wife got so sick of him smelling like
[01:27:12.580 --> 01:27:14.580]  You know shit
[01:27:14.980 --> 01:27:21.780]  That she helped him actually develop the johnson-sue and what it is is it's basically it's a cage and you can see on the bottom
[01:27:21.780 --> 01:27:28.820]  Right, you have these little posts sticking in there and that's to to form air now the basis behind it is
[01:27:29.620 --> 01:27:32.580]  Oxygen can penetrate one foot into a soil system
[01:27:33.380 --> 01:27:41.460]  So they have these uh sleeves in there so that there's never ever any more distance from an oxygen source than
[01:27:41.940 --> 01:27:43.940]  um one foot
[01:27:44.020 --> 01:27:45.620]  Okay, um
[01:27:45.620 --> 01:27:49.140]  So underneath they have a pallet so they have oxygen flow there
[01:27:49.540 --> 01:27:54.180]  They put those in they load up the bioreactor within three days
[01:27:54.660 --> 01:27:59.860]  They can take those tubes out and it doesn't collapse because the biofilm has actually been formed already
[01:28:00.340 --> 01:28:05.300]  Now it's a cold compost. It does not go full thermophilic. You do not want to take
[01:28:05.780 --> 01:28:10.740]  Um that type of a system into the thermophilic if you do pull it apart start again
[01:28:11.300 --> 01:28:15.880]  Okay, because it's a cold compost it doesn't go over the 120 so it's not killing the biology
[01:28:16.660 --> 01:28:18.420]  um now
[01:28:18.420 --> 01:28:25.860]  One of the tricks is you have to keep that compost moist when you put it in you're keeping it moist and um,
[01:28:26.260 --> 01:28:27.940]  you actually put
[01:28:27.940 --> 01:28:33.460]  And you can see the holes just uh, um to the left of her ear. You see a little green hose
[01:28:33.940 --> 01:28:38.900]  Um going up to the top of the reactor that's for a watering system and you put one minute
[01:28:39.380 --> 01:28:41.300]  Of water in there
[01:28:41.300 --> 01:28:48.740]  Every day to try to keep that at 70 moisture and then it doesn't allow it to go thermophilic. It keeps it down and
[01:28:49.300 --> 01:28:51.620]  Somebody had said it takes nine months
[01:28:52.180 --> 01:29:00.020]  Um before you can put your worms in uh, no, it's uh more like a few days because once it's gone through that
[01:29:00.180 --> 01:29:05.460]  Uh peak of the thermophilic and it starts to come down as soon as your worms can survive in that system
[01:29:05.540 --> 01:29:07.540]  Because it's not going to go back up
[01:29:07.780 --> 01:29:10.900]  Unless of course you start adding more stuff. So don't
[01:29:11.540 --> 01:29:15.060]  You put your worms in and they go to work because they can survive in that system
[01:29:15.620 --> 01:29:17.620]  the longer johnson
[01:29:17.700 --> 01:29:19.700]  soup bioreactor sits
[01:29:20.340 --> 01:29:27.620]  The more microbiology it develops and because you haven't went thermophilic you haven't had to start back into the bacterial all the way
[01:29:28.020 --> 01:29:30.440]  You've actually started in the higher generational
[01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:38.060]  And then your system grows and he's kind of I think um, I think it's 23 000 different varieties of bacteria
[01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:40.680]  um after one to two years
[01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:42.040]  um
[01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:44.920]  Now your normal compost pile on the right, you know
[01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:50.520]  You're just throwing everything in and I tried that and my back's so fucked. I can't turn that kind of stuff
[01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:52.760]  So I actually built the the johnson's
[01:29:53.780 --> 01:29:54.920]  sue
[01:29:54.920 --> 01:29:56.680]  the picture on the right
[01:29:56.680 --> 01:30:01.560]  Um, you see the the stakes coming up that's a true johnson's sue the picture on the left
[01:30:01.720 --> 01:30:06.600]  It was developed by a gentleman on youtube called diego footer who's actually had dr
[01:30:06.600 --> 01:30:09.880]  Elaine on his podcast has had dr. Johnson on this podcast
[01:30:10.520 --> 01:30:15.560]  He took the principles behind it and that the oxygen will only go one foot
[01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:20.140]  So that your your compost can never go. Um, uh anaerobic
[01:30:20.600 --> 01:30:22.600]  Okay is the basic idea
[01:30:22.760 --> 01:30:28.120]  Um, he actually took the the six foot circumference and he puts a two foot sleeve in the center
[01:30:28.280 --> 01:30:31.080]  So instead of having all these posts and ones that you have to remove
[01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:36.920]  You just load up the outside and it it is a foot of air coming in from the one side a foot of air coming
[01:30:36.920 --> 01:30:38.920]  from the other and and
[01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:43.160]  He's still in trials on that. He set up his first one that way
[01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:51.240]  Well probably about 10 11 months ago, and I haven't seen an update from him. Um on on how it's been developing yet
[01:30:51.800 --> 01:30:52.520]  But
[01:30:52.520 --> 01:30:55.960]  With the johnson sue and and elaine's talked to this as well
[01:30:56.200 --> 01:31:00.760]  The color of the compost really matters on his system when it gets to a certain point
[01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:03.800]  It actually looks like plodder's clay. It's it's more of a
[01:31:04.360 --> 01:31:07.080]  uh tan or a brown
[01:31:07.800 --> 01:31:09.080]  than black
[01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:11.480]  and and he can actually take that and
[01:31:12.040 --> 01:31:15.320]  Just like elaine and just like everybody here. He can make
[01:31:15.880 --> 01:31:17.880]  uh an extract from that
[01:31:18.280 --> 01:31:22.520]  And apply it to a field and and cover thousands of acres
[01:31:23.240 --> 01:31:27.160]  With a very small amount now his first experiment. He uh,
[01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:34.360]  Did this and he put the whole thing onto the the field that the university that he was working for gave him
[01:31:34.600 --> 01:31:37.180]  Now you can go back and you can look at the progression
[01:31:38.040 --> 01:31:42.120]  Of that particular block because they haven't done the university hasn't done anything else with that
[01:31:42.520 --> 01:31:44.860]  They have left it to him to see the progression
[01:31:45.740 --> 01:31:50.700]  And if you look at where he first started we first planted there to where it is now
[01:31:51.580 --> 01:31:55.020]  he's seeing genetic expressions in size of plants that
[01:31:55.660 --> 01:32:02.700]  He never thought was possible instead of a sunflower being five or six feet tall. It's 10 and 12 and 13 feet tall
[01:32:03.740 --> 01:32:06.220]  And he's only ever done one application now
[01:32:06.940 --> 01:32:09.260]  because uh on the original, um
[01:32:10.220 --> 01:32:13.420]  Part he wasn't he had never really got into the extracts
[01:32:13.660 --> 01:32:19.900]  He took the actual compost and spread it out on this plot of land. He's never had to put another addition in
[01:32:20.700 --> 01:32:25.580]  it has just developed and gotten better and better just like our soil systems in the living soil because
[01:32:26.140 --> 01:32:27.720]  you know the
[01:32:27.720 --> 01:32:29.340]  microbiology is
[01:32:29.340 --> 01:32:32.700]  Uh as layton says it's always moving. It's always growing
[01:32:33.420 --> 01:32:35.420]  Right and and the interconnections
[01:32:35.660 --> 01:32:38.480]  So the johnson sioux is is a fantastic system
[01:32:39.500 --> 01:32:41.500]  Um, if you have the time
[01:32:41.820 --> 01:32:44.780]  Because it's it's like, uh, the hugo culture
[01:32:45.180 --> 01:32:49.740]  It's you set it and you forget it until you know for six months
[01:32:50.300 --> 01:32:51.260]  and
[01:32:51.260 --> 01:32:53.740]  Uh, the hugo culture actually came from the nomads
[01:32:53.900 --> 01:32:59.980]  They would set up their their their camp and they would build a hugo culture. Uh when they got there
[01:33:00.140 --> 01:33:02.140]  They got there
[01:33:02.140 --> 01:33:07.420]  and they already had one from the last year that they were there and they would break that apart and and and they had
[01:33:07.420 --> 01:33:09.580]  Their compost they had this beautiful soil
[01:33:09.980 --> 01:33:13.100]  They started another one right away because they could do the same thing at the end
[01:33:13.500 --> 01:33:17.500]  to give a boost for the next year and sort of the the third one so that
[01:33:18.300 --> 01:33:24.540]  As the the weather moved in and they followed the herd away and went to their their summer camp or their winter camp, you know
[01:33:24.860 --> 01:33:28.540]  Um, they would have another hugo there and they were always improving their soils
[01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:30.460]  Okay
[01:33:30.460 --> 01:33:34.220]  But they didn't have to do anything. They just had to set it and forget it and walk away
[01:33:34.540 --> 01:33:37.660]  And that's the process with johnson sioux. You set it up
[01:33:38.460 --> 01:33:43.180]  And you walk away. You don't have to spend time if you have an automatic water other than that
[01:33:43.340 --> 01:33:47.420]  I don't so i'm up there with my hose, you know spraying it down once a day
[01:33:47.980 --> 01:33:52.140]  now it's in you know frozen solid solid right now, so
[01:33:52.700 --> 01:33:53.820]  but
[01:33:53.820 --> 01:33:56.940]  That's the premise of the johnson sioux. So we'll take the next slide
[01:33:58.860 --> 01:34:02.780]  Poor peter he's going. Oh, oh, hold on. Hold on. Oh, I gotta put this down first
[01:34:07.350 --> 01:34:09.610]  Worm casting and vermicompost
[01:34:11.110 --> 01:34:14.070]  So the johnson sioux you're putting in the worms so really
[01:34:14.710 --> 01:34:17.850]  What you're doing is you're making a what I call a vermicast
[01:34:19.030 --> 01:34:23.830]  Okay, you're taking a compost that has already basically been finished
[01:34:24.710 --> 01:34:30.950]  And it's it's you know, you could spread that pretty much on your your garden almost almost right away as soon as it gets
[01:34:31.350 --> 01:34:33.350]  You know down low enough in temperature
[01:34:34.070 --> 01:34:37.030]  But you're adding the worms and all of a sudden you have
[01:34:37.670 --> 01:34:38.630]  this
[01:34:38.630 --> 01:34:40.870]  Worm bin that's freaking huge
[01:34:42.790 --> 01:34:49.590]  And as it develops and as it develops over time and changes from the black which is what we would consider
[01:34:49.830 --> 01:34:55.110]  A damn good freaking compost it probably smells wonderful smells like the forest floor
[01:34:55.750 --> 01:34:58.790]  But in the johnson sioux it takes it to the next level
[01:34:59.430 --> 01:35:03.750]  Why because of the worms and and a function of time?
[01:35:05.030 --> 01:35:09.290]  We're always in such a freaking hurry, you know, it's instant gratification
[01:35:10.630 --> 01:35:12.630]  you know, um
[01:35:12.870 --> 01:35:14.870]  We've been taught that you know
[01:35:15.670 --> 01:35:18.710]  It's got to be fast. You got to get there. You got to do this. You got to do this
[01:35:18.870 --> 01:35:22.230]  We try to stuff so much in our day. We can't slow down to smell the roses
[01:35:23.110 --> 01:35:24.550]  We can't smell
[01:35:24.550 --> 01:35:27.450]  Slow down enough to meditate to understand
[01:35:28.390 --> 01:35:30.550]  You know to just let your mind
[01:35:31.430 --> 01:35:32.790]  float
[01:35:32.790 --> 01:35:34.790]  And see what comes up
[01:35:34.950 --> 01:35:36.390]  Okay
[01:35:36.390 --> 01:35:39.750]  That that's your body your essence your soul
[01:35:40.470 --> 01:35:42.710]  You know supplying you answers
[01:35:43.750 --> 01:35:47.670]  That you would never come up with before because it's got all this knowledge
[01:35:48.930 --> 01:35:50.930]  Everything that you have ever seen
[01:35:51.590 --> 01:35:52.790]  smelt
[01:35:52.790 --> 01:35:56.950]  Tasted heard etc. Is a video image
[01:35:57.990 --> 01:36:02.790]  in your brain or in the energy field around you if you want to say
[01:36:03.510 --> 01:36:05.430]  and any time that
[01:36:05.430 --> 01:36:06.230]  you
[01:36:06.230 --> 01:36:07.190]  uh
[01:36:07.190 --> 01:36:09.430]  Want to remember a very special moment
[01:36:10.230 --> 01:36:12.870]  You know when you had your first child
[01:36:13.430 --> 01:36:15.910]  If you close your eyes you can take yourself to that moment
[01:36:16.390 --> 01:36:21.350]  And you'll feel a breeze and you'll smell what you smelt then it's all there
[01:36:22.230 --> 01:36:24.230]  the problem is
[01:36:24.710 --> 01:36:27.110]  I haven't trained my microbiology well enough
[01:36:27.750 --> 01:36:29.750]  You know bring that out very easily
[01:36:30.470 --> 01:36:31.670]  and
[01:36:31.670 --> 01:36:34.550]  That's the problem is it's there. It's all there
[01:36:34.710 --> 01:36:41.910]  We just can't access it very easily unless it's a very special moment in time either a positive moment or a negative moment
[01:36:43.030 --> 01:36:49.350]  And or a traumatic moment I broke my leg, you know, um, there's the cell memory for that
[01:36:50.390 --> 01:36:51.750]  okay, but
[01:36:51.750 --> 01:36:59.110]  For the vermicast we're adding these worms and they're taking this to the next level. So it's the next level of compost
[01:36:59.670 --> 01:37:06.150]  um, I can take a compost and I can you know, uh, take a pound of it throw it in a
[01:37:06.710 --> 01:37:08.710]  A piece of pantyhose
[01:37:09.190 --> 01:37:15.910]  And you know go up and down in a water bucket and squeeze it massage it and I can get out the the the folic acid
[01:37:15.990 --> 01:37:17.990]  Or no, sorry the humic humic acid
[01:37:18.950 --> 01:37:23.510]  But in order to get the folic acid out I have to take that and I have to do another process
[01:37:23.590 --> 01:37:25.590]  I have to press it. I have to compress it
[01:37:26.950 --> 01:37:28.950]  To bring that out
[01:37:29.590 --> 01:37:30.470]  so
[01:37:30.470 --> 01:37:32.470]  If we take our raw compost
[01:37:32.790 --> 01:37:36.630]  It's like adding that pressure to to take it to the next level
[01:37:37.110 --> 01:37:42.390]  The worms are going to take it to the next level because when they are burrowing through your system
[01:37:42.470 --> 01:37:49.210]  Not only are they creating air passages and water passages and maybe super highways for microbes
[01:37:49.910 --> 01:37:54.550]  You know, actually I think that the the hyphy is is more of the super highway for the microbes
[01:37:55.350 --> 01:37:57.030]  um, but
[01:37:57.030 --> 01:37:59.030]  You're taking it to that next level
[01:37:59.990 --> 01:38:04.630]  And when the the worm is burrowing through and it takes that into their body
[01:38:05.270 --> 01:38:07.670]  It only actually takes a very small amount
[01:38:08.710 --> 01:38:10.310]  to feed the worm
[01:38:10.310 --> 01:38:12.710]  the rest it's just adding its
[01:38:13.430 --> 01:38:14.530]  gut
[01:38:14.530 --> 01:38:16.530]  bacteria and biology
[01:38:16.790 --> 01:38:19.350]  Into it and it's coming out the other end
[01:38:20.230 --> 01:38:26.410]  And that's why worm castings is so good. It's not that your compost was that good. It's the combination
[01:38:27.210 --> 01:38:29.210]  of the worms biology
[01:38:29.930 --> 01:38:31.210]  and it's
[01:38:31.210 --> 01:38:34.510]  I don't I don't think they actually use an acid. I think it's more of an enzyme
[01:38:34.890 --> 01:38:39.930]  But it's that combination that makes worm castings that much better
[01:38:40.810 --> 01:38:42.810]  than just regular compost
[01:38:43.210 --> 01:38:49.370]  So if you are doing a compost and you're not adding worms once the temperature comes down you're losing out
[01:38:50.330 --> 01:38:52.330]  Consider that so next slide, please
[01:38:52.970 --> 01:38:54.970]  Oh
[01:38:55.610 --> 01:38:57.610]  Caught peter napping again
[01:38:58.010 --> 01:39:04.810]  Oh natural farming methods more commonly known and referred to as korean natural farming, but of course
[01:39:04.970 --> 01:39:09.130]  um, we all know that natural farming has been around a lot longer than
[01:39:10.330 --> 01:39:14.490]  You know, uh, the gentleman that's bringing natural farming to us
[01:39:15.690 --> 01:39:17.690]  but the principles
[01:39:18.010 --> 01:39:20.010]  Is what you want to understand it's it's
[01:39:20.810 --> 01:39:27.870]  Not necessarily that you're going to build this box to do an imo or collect indigenous microorganisms
[01:39:28.890 --> 01:39:29.770]  Okay
[01:39:29.770 --> 01:39:30.570]  um
[01:39:30.570 --> 01:39:34.750]  It's the principles behind it. It's we need the organized
[01:39:35.290 --> 01:39:39.950]  Or sorry the organisms that exist in our environment
[01:39:41.370 --> 01:39:47.610]  Okay, because that's what the barometric pressure is telling the plant
[01:39:48.410 --> 01:39:50.410]  It needs
[01:39:51.050 --> 01:39:53.050]  vapor pressure deficit
[01:39:53.050 --> 01:39:54.550]  when I
[01:39:54.550 --> 01:39:56.650]  decarboxylate my sour diesel
[01:39:57.690 --> 01:40:02.730]  I actually because I live in emmonton and i'm not at sea level. I have to add
[01:40:03.290 --> 01:40:07.230]  You know 15 minutes to the time that I decarboxylate
[01:40:08.170 --> 01:40:10.170]  because of the barometric pressure
[01:40:11.530 --> 01:40:14.830]  That difference so when you're collecting your imo
[01:40:15.470 --> 01:40:18.350]  They say don't go more than a certain level
[01:40:19.230 --> 01:40:20.590]  up
[01:40:20.590 --> 01:40:24.930]  You can go down all you want, but you can't go up in elevation
[01:40:25.470 --> 01:40:29.870]  I I believe that's right or i'm i'm either backwards or i'm right. I'm not latent
[01:40:30.270 --> 01:40:34.930]  So uh bottom line is it has been determined that if you harvest microbes
[01:40:35.470 --> 01:40:40.450]  At a greater elevation in which you live you are going to get a higher succession
[01:40:41.010 --> 01:40:45.410]  Uh, okay. Yeah, not succession successful transfer. Thank you
[01:40:46.610 --> 01:40:49.650]  Okay, so I was half right. I was half right. Okay
[01:40:50.290 --> 01:40:51.410]  um
[01:40:51.410 --> 01:40:55.810]  So when you're collecting that and and layton has mentioned this in one of his shows
[01:40:55.890 --> 01:41:00.290]  You want to look for that place where the wind comes around that rock or that?
[01:41:00.610 --> 01:41:06.210]  That tree that's fallen over because that's where the leaf mulch is actually collecting. It's not being disturbed
[01:41:06.210 --> 01:41:09.490]  It's like an eddy in a stream. Where are the fish gonna be?
[01:41:10.130 --> 01:41:12.130]  Uh, they're gonna be in that little eddy
[01:41:12.290 --> 01:41:17.650]  Okay, they're not gonna be well, they are gonna be in the main, but they're resting in that eddy and they're going
[01:41:17.890 --> 01:41:20.290]  Is there any groceries around anybody see a fly?
[01:41:21.170 --> 01:41:23.570]  Oh, and you put a fly in it. Oh, hey, I got it
[01:41:24.130 --> 01:41:25.250]  You know
[01:41:25.250 --> 01:41:26.850]  Uh, yeah
[01:41:26.850 --> 01:41:29.490]  They let the food come to them, right? They're smart
[01:41:30.930 --> 01:41:35.810]  I think they're a lot smarter than us, you know, but you know, that's just personal, you know, but anyway
[01:41:36.690 --> 01:41:37.890]  um
[01:41:37.890 --> 01:41:41.590]  So when you're creating a vermicompost
[01:41:42.450 --> 01:41:44.450]  or any type of compost
[01:41:44.930 --> 01:41:47.810]  the more that you can shove into the more
[01:41:48.290 --> 01:41:49.310]  um
[01:41:49.310 --> 01:41:54.290]  Variety and i'm not just talking, you know, um leaf mulch i'm talking
[01:41:54.910 --> 01:42:01.890]  avocado tech because an avocado has its own set of microbiology that exists within the plant
[01:42:02.530 --> 01:42:07.910]  On its surface and in its tissue because who's creating that tissue well the microbiology
[01:42:09.410 --> 01:42:16.850]  So if you're taking all these different elements that you can get your hands on whether it's it's uh, you know nature
[01:42:17.410 --> 01:42:18.770]  or
[01:42:18.770 --> 01:42:21.810]  Oh god, the term is slipping out of my brain. Um
[01:42:22.590 --> 01:42:29.490]  Crafting nature crafting going out and gathering the wild wild craft wild crafting. Sorry. Thank you. Layton
[01:42:29.890 --> 01:42:32.930]  Oh, you're a prince man, you're totally early a prince, okay
[01:42:33.490 --> 01:42:34.770]  um
[01:42:34.770 --> 01:42:36.770]  When you're wild crafting
[01:42:36.850 --> 01:42:39.410]  You know, you don't want to just go to one spot
[01:42:39.490 --> 01:42:45.410]  You want to go to a thousand spots as many as you can get to and you don't want to just stay on terra firma
[01:42:46.610 --> 01:42:52.370]  Okay, you want to go to the edge of a pond or a swamp or a river?
[01:42:53.010 --> 01:42:54.930]  Grab that
[01:42:54.930 --> 01:42:56.690]  now if it doesn't
[01:42:56.690 --> 01:43:01.250]  Match your biology if your biology is at a different level than that
[01:43:02.130 --> 01:43:04.130]  As layton says oh lunch
[01:43:04.690 --> 01:43:07.090]  You just gave your biology an extra snack
[01:43:07.810 --> 01:43:10.230]  But you also added the components
[01:43:11.170 --> 01:43:19.410]  From that biology that may not have existed in your soil system before so it may not just be the biology that you need
[01:43:19.730 --> 01:43:21.090]  it may be
[01:43:21.090 --> 01:43:25.090]  Uh things on the atomic level that didn't exist in your soil system
[01:43:25.650 --> 01:43:27.650]  That you actually need
[01:43:27.810 --> 01:43:30.770]  for the body of the next layer of
[01:43:31.310 --> 01:43:38.530]  Microbiology that you're trying to develop and you can't develop that unless you have this that's where layton says sometimes you need to go back
[01:43:39.170 --> 01:43:41.170]  Before you can move forward
[01:43:41.810 --> 01:43:46.070]  I am always a perfect example of going out and finding
[01:43:47.630 --> 01:43:54.770]  biology that you don't have access to in your system and adding it into your system and
[01:43:55.490 --> 01:44:01.490]  The one of the gentlemen that I follow. Um good friends with with kevin or chris trump. Sorry. Um
[01:44:02.450 --> 01:44:07.890]  He's studied he's went overseas and he has studied. Um with the the
[01:44:08.530 --> 01:44:11.570]  Oh, man, his his name is slipping. Dr. Cho
[01:44:12.050 --> 01:44:17.510]  Our master cho or yeah master cho master cho. Thank you. Just confirmation
[01:44:18.050 --> 01:44:22.230]  um, he's actually spent hours and hours videotaping and documenting
[01:44:23.110 --> 01:44:25.110]  And you you're you know
[01:44:26.150 --> 01:44:28.150]  Watching a translator, you know
[01:44:28.770 --> 01:44:30.770]  translating what dr. Cho is saying
[01:44:31.350 --> 01:44:33.670]  And if you go through his videos
[01:44:34.310 --> 01:44:37.270]  It's it's a little bit more in depth than what chris does
[01:44:37.910 --> 01:44:39.910]  uh chris
[01:44:40.390 --> 01:44:43.030]  I think chris got smacked in the head too many times
[01:44:43.510 --> 01:44:49.830]  Um by the by the people in the comments and he stepped back because he didn't want the contention
[01:44:49.830 --> 01:44:56.790]  He didn't want that that anger that emotion where i'm at a point where you can say whatever you want. It doesn't matter to me
[01:44:57.430 --> 01:44:59.430]  Chris isn't at that point yet
[01:44:59.430 --> 01:45:01.030]  um, but
[01:45:01.030 --> 01:45:03.030]  in one of his original videos
[01:45:03.510 --> 01:45:05.190]  he um
[01:45:05.190 --> 01:45:08.790]  showed making an fpj or fermented plant juice
[01:45:09.590 --> 01:45:11.510]  but in reality
[01:45:11.510 --> 01:45:15.190]  He wasn't making an fpj. He wasn't making an ffj
[01:45:16.150 --> 01:45:19.270]  Fermented fruit juice because he was using. Um
[01:45:20.150 --> 01:45:21.490]  uh
[01:45:21.490 --> 01:45:22.950]  bananas
[01:45:22.950 --> 01:45:28.550]  Unripe bananas, you know that the bud of the tree for the banana tree. So that's the fruit
[01:45:29.190 --> 01:45:33.030]  But when he described it you had to put a sugar cap on top
[01:45:33.590 --> 01:45:37.370]  And if you're making ffj, yes, you do if you're making an fpj
[01:45:38.070 --> 01:45:39.430]  No, you don't
[01:45:39.430 --> 01:45:43.830]  That and I couldn't figure out why my fpj's were failing the first two times I tried them
[01:45:44.150 --> 01:45:46.470]  It was because I was putting this damn sugar cap on top
[01:45:47.110 --> 01:45:49.690]  And it wasn't that he was trying to to give misinformation
[01:45:50.550 --> 01:45:53.510]  Hell, no, he's he's trying to share with you what's going on
[01:45:54.310 --> 01:45:59.450]  But those little little little things that you don't quite understand
[01:46:00.870 --> 01:46:09.290]  That makes a huge huge difference. It's like okay. Um, I just built this this airplane or I just serviced this airplane
[01:46:09.750 --> 01:46:14.790]  And it's flying away and i'm looking at my my shop table and i'm going oh fuck man
[01:46:15.430 --> 01:46:17.430]  Where's that bolt supposed to go
[01:46:18.310 --> 01:46:21.910]  There's something missing and all of a sudden he hears a crash and like oh fuck
[01:46:23.430 --> 01:46:26.070]  You know, it's it's the little things it's that
[01:46:26.950 --> 01:46:31.110]  If there's one piece of the the whole puzzle that's missing
[01:46:31.990 --> 01:46:36.710]  Are you gonna see the whole puzzle? You can't see the picture because that one piece is missing
[01:46:37.510 --> 01:46:40.950]  And until you have that piece and you can see the whole picture
[01:46:41.910 --> 01:46:43.750]  You know, you're screwed
[01:46:43.750 --> 01:46:49.430]  You know if you don't step back and and take that overview approach if you get too close to the problem
[01:46:51.510 --> 01:46:53.510]  You're part of the problem
[01:46:56.070 --> 01:46:58.630]  As the wife just said you can't see the forest for the trees
[01:46:59.350 --> 01:47:02.150]  because you're too close you need to step back and
[01:47:02.950 --> 01:47:05.050]  And and take that overview approach
[01:47:05.670 --> 01:47:09.270]  And say okay i'm gonna do a little bit of knf
[01:47:09.830 --> 01:47:17.990]  Or natural farming i'm gonna do a little bit of composting but because you know, I I'm in a wheelchair say
[01:47:18.630 --> 01:47:21.850]  Like mr. Toad. I I can't do a thermophilic
[01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:25.270]  But I can do
[01:47:25.270 --> 01:47:29.030]  A johnson suit you can only do so much
[01:47:29.590 --> 01:47:32.630]  Every single person only has so many hours in the day
[01:47:33.590 --> 01:47:35.270]  okay, so
[01:47:35.270 --> 01:47:37.830]  I can do a johnson suit because
[01:47:38.710 --> 01:47:39.830]  I don't have to flip it
[01:47:39.830 --> 01:47:44.710]  I don't have to grab a shovel or a pitchfork or anything like that and go out there and turn that pile
[01:47:45.430 --> 01:47:49.430]  I just have to set it up. I have to burn that energy to get it set up
[01:47:50.470 --> 01:47:54.390]  But then I can just sit back and wait because I have the time
[01:47:55.030 --> 01:47:58.630]  I don't have the physical body that I can do what I used to do
[01:47:59.590 --> 01:48:01.590]  But I have the time
[01:48:02.070 --> 01:48:06.390]  Now if you're living in an apartment, you don't have the the land to put something up
[01:48:06.790 --> 01:48:08.790]  You don't have the the
[01:48:09.410 --> 01:48:11.410]  available
[01:48:13.250 --> 01:48:19.750]  Biology in the city that you do in the forest if you live in the country, but you can still do
[01:48:21.590 --> 01:48:24.790]  A worm farm you can still do a compost tumbler
[01:48:25.910 --> 01:48:28.310]  You can make the compost and then feed it to your worms
[01:48:29.030 --> 01:48:31.830]  and you can also feed, you know, just your
[01:48:32.630 --> 01:48:38.070]  Bad vegetables into the worm bin, but you can take things from all over the place
[01:48:39.030 --> 01:48:42.230]  Creating your basically your own imo in your own house
[01:48:43.830 --> 01:48:46.230]  And the more biodiverse you make that
[01:48:47.270 --> 01:48:49.670]  The better off when you add it to your system
[01:48:50.550 --> 01:48:55.910]  the more biologically diverse it is the further along it is in the
[01:48:57.330 --> 01:48:59.670]  transitional life of a soil system
[01:49:00.550 --> 01:49:06.150]  The more you're going to have the microbiology that can break down the sand silt and clay
[01:49:07.110 --> 01:49:10.230]  And make those available to the plant
[01:49:11.190 --> 01:49:16.630]  Who is is paying the microbiology to do their job with baking cookies?
[01:49:17.490 --> 01:49:23.190]  Personally, I think I'd rather have bacon or steak, you know, you know, but you know, that's just me, right?
[01:49:24.630 --> 01:49:26.630]  So we'll go to the next slide
[01:49:27.590 --> 01:49:30.630]  I don't want to get too into the into the weeds
[01:49:31.270 --> 01:49:32.790]  um
[01:49:32.790 --> 01:49:37.210]  On the difference between natural farming and the different methods of composting
[01:49:38.150 --> 01:49:39.670]  um
[01:49:39.670 --> 01:49:45.770]  But this baby, oh my god this if you're not doing ferments
[01:49:46.550 --> 01:49:52.730]  If you're not doing, you know, juicing and you know breaking down breaking the bonds
[01:49:53.670 --> 01:49:55.670]  Um to get the raw
[01:49:56.370 --> 01:49:58.370]  Materials that are lacking
[01:49:59.030 --> 01:50:01.030]  You're missing the boat
[01:50:01.590 --> 01:50:07.590]  Okay, you're actually you're in a boat and you just pulled the plug in the bottom and it's filling with water because
[01:50:08.230 --> 01:50:15.990]  You know without this the the fermentation of different plant material to give back to your plant where you're actually
[01:50:16.470 --> 01:50:21.270]  Taking it from something that the plant or the microbiology would have to fight
[01:50:21.750 --> 01:50:27.270]  And produce its own exudates to break down it have to produce its own acids to break down
[01:50:27.750 --> 01:50:32.390]  You're breaking it down for it. And all of a sudden it doesn't have to work so hard
[01:50:33.430 --> 01:50:38.630]  Okay. Now you look at poor poor peter in the background. He's working his bag off back there
[01:50:38.870 --> 01:50:42.390]  You know, he's doing seeds and he's doing this and he's communicating
[01:50:42.390 --> 01:50:47.370]  He's helping people on the technical end to come on to these programs, etc
[01:50:48.010 --> 01:50:51.050]  You know, he's in there breaking it all down
[01:50:51.610 --> 01:51:00.090]  In behind the scenes well with fermenting you're breaking it down before you're giving it into your soil system before you're giving it
[01:51:00.410 --> 01:51:02.430]  Making it available to the microbiology
[01:51:03.770 --> 01:51:05.770]  And they don't have to work so hard
[01:51:06.330 --> 01:51:10.510]  So they can maybe maybe they can enjoy their life. Maybe they can go out and do some meditation
[01:51:10.970 --> 01:51:14.570]  Maybe they can do a quorum sensing and figure out something that wasn't there before
[01:51:15.530 --> 01:51:18.650]  The more we can give that's already broken down
[01:51:20.170 --> 01:51:26.330]  And easier for the system to to make bio available to our plant
[01:51:27.610 --> 01:51:28.650]  Okay
[01:51:28.650 --> 01:51:33.210]  The less stress there is on the plant. She doesn't have to you know
[01:51:34.490 --> 01:51:36.490]  make extra exudates
[01:51:37.130 --> 01:51:43.690]  Okay, so she doesn't have to take those those uh sun that sun energy those protons and convert it
[01:51:44.250 --> 01:51:47.630]  Into an exudate she can help the biology
[01:51:48.410 --> 01:51:50.410]  um convert that into
[01:51:50.570 --> 01:51:56.990]  A leaf structure now if you don't understand it takes seven days for a new leaf to grow as as is my understanding
[01:51:57.690 --> 01:51:59.690]  Okay
[01:52:00.010 --> 01:52:01.610]  Seven days
[01:52:01.610 --> 01:52:03.610]  So if your biology
[01:52:04.490 --> 01:52:09.290]  In that seven days has went through ten thousand generations say
[01:52:09.770 --> 01:52:10.730]  Okay
[01:52:10.730 --> 01:52:12.730]  The guy that started
[01:52:12.810 --> 01:52:16.170]  That leaf structure and the guy that finishes that leaf structure
[01:52:17.130 --> 01:52:19.770]  Well, he's a very distant relative to the first guy
[01:52:20.650 --> 01:52:22.650]  And what did he learn along the way?
[01:52:23.290 --> 01:52:28.910]  What did those generations pick up that they did first one didn't actually understand?
[01:52:29.610 --> 01:52:33.150]  That's part of the the imo. You're you're taking a snapshot
[01:52:34.010 --> 01:52:38.090]  of the biology at that particular time in that particular place
[01:52:38.970 --> 01:52:42.270]  And you're putting in into homostasis or homostasis
[01:52:43.450 --> 01:52:50.330]  Okay, you're taking a freeze frame and you're adding enough sugar that you're combining with the water
[01:52:50.650 --> 01:52:57.290]  And so that the biology can't use the water to continue its process and it grabs that particular food source that it likes
[01:52:57.850 --> 01:53:00.250]  Probably steak, you know steak's better, you know
[01:53:00.890 --> 01:53:05.290]  but it takes that and it and it forms its cyst and it can exist in that cyst for
[01:53:06.170 --> 01:53:09.870]  Tens and tens of thousands of years if not millions
[01:53:11.370 --> 01:53:13.930]  Okay, so you've got this
[01:53:15.670 --> 01:53:18.890]  Generational system that has been learning and growing in your soil
[01:53:19.610 --> 01:53:26.250]  To create this leaf and it's going after, you know, say 5 000 generations. It's going okay
[01:53:26.650 --> 01:53:28.650]  Um, I don't have enough of this
[01:53:29.530 --> 01:53:31.790]  To make the next generation of my biology
[01:53:32.350 --> 01:53:34.350]  Do you think you're gonna have a healthy leaf
[01:53:35.230 --> 01:53:37.870]  If the guys aren't there to do the work
[01:53:38.430 --> 01:53:40.750]  No, hell no. You're not gonna have a healthy leaf
[01:53:41.790 --> 01:53:46.990]  Just like you wouldn't have a house that would stand up if the guys didn't show up to put up the two by fours
[01:53:47.150 --> 01:53:52.910]  But the roofers showed up you can put the roof on but there's no freaking structure underneath it to put the roof on
[01:53:53.630 --> 01:53:55.390]  Not a very nice house
[01:53:55.390 --> 01:53:59.710]  And i'm kind of flat, you know, let's got a really peaked roof might be able to live in it
[01:53:59.870 --> 01:54:05.470]  But the more we can supply to our plants to ourselves
[01:54:06.430 --> 01:54:09.170]  In a broken down form through a ferment
[01:54:10.670 --> 01:54:12.670]  And make it more easily
[01:54:13.290 --> 01:54:17.870]  Usable by our biology the further ahead we're going to be so next slide, please
[01:54:21.710 --> 01:54:25.310]  Uh caught peter knapping again does this really work
[01:54:25.790 --> 01:54:27.790]  So
[01:54:28.990 --> 01:54:35.230]  I'm not going to try to pronounce that mexican word. I've you know, maybe somebody else can but no
[01:54:35.950 --> 01:54:37.470]  Okay
[01:54:37.470 --> 01:54:38.510]  um
[01:54:38.510 --> 01:54:40.190]  This is an image
[01:54:40.190 --> 01:54:44.750]  Of a farm in uh, well, I'll let you try to pronounce it in the desert
[01:54:45.390 --> 01:54:47.230]  Okay
[01:54:47.230 --> 01:54:49.230]  at the time of the image
[01:54:49.710 --> 01:54:52.830]  This gentleman's farm could support all of his crops
[01:54:53.310 --> 01:54:56.430]  This gentleman's farm could support one cow
[01:54:57.630 --> 01:54:59.370]  for every
[01:54:59.370 --> 01:55:03.470]  250 acres of land that he owned next slide, please
[01:55:05.070 --> 01:55:07.070]  So if it works
[01:55:08.110 --> 01:55:10.110]  This is what his results were
[01:55:10.910 --> 01:55:12.190]  Huh?
[01:55:12.190 --> 01:55:14.270]  Shitload of grass there. It looks really good
[01:55:15.230 --> 01:55:18.110]  You know, um his stream looks like it came back
[01:55:19.610 --> 01:55:21.610]  Hmm interesting
[01:55:22.570 --> 01:55:26.090]  Yes, this does work. Lillian's proved it. Dr
[01:55:26.230 --> 01:55:34.170]  Johnson's proved it through trials and trials and trials over and over and over and over again bringing it to the world
[01:55:35.050 --> 01:55:37.050]  and the world
[01:55:37.130 --> 01:55:39.130]  Very few have been listening
[01:55:40.010 --> 01:55:46.490]  Why because she's been suppressed her information has been suppressed because you know if we're all healthy
[01:55:47.050 --> 01:55:48.810]  Who's going to make money?
[01:55:48.810 --> 01:55:52.350]  Off of us if we're not sick and buying pharmaceuticals
[01:55:54.570 --> 01:56:00.970]  It's all a matter of money and who's controlling it and how much power they have to direct it
[01:56:01.210 --> 01:56:03.610]  We know who trains our doctors
[01:56:05.130 --> 01:56:09.690]  It isn't the biology training them. No, it's the guys that are making the chemicals that
[01:56:10.810 --> 01:56:12.810]  well you I
[01:56:12.970 --> 01:56:17.930]  Will stop there because you know, I might get into trouble and the wife is telling me. No. No, no, don't go there
[01:56:18.810 --> 01:56:20.810]  Okay, next slide peter, please
[01:56:26.420 --> 01:56:27.700]  Oh
[01:56:27.700 --> 01:56:33.380]  I hope you weren't busy, you know, we didn't have any uh, you know mic moments that we could capture there peter
[01:56:34.340 --> 01:56:36.500]  You know not going to the bathroom or anything. So
[01:56:37.460 --> 01:56:39.460]  Here's them together
[01:56:39.620 --> 01:56:44.180]  You know, this is what the ground looked like before a dry creek bed
[01:56:45.220 --> 01:56:47.220]  and then you have
[01:56:47.380 --> 01:56:49.380]  adding the biology and all of a sudden
[01:56:50.180 --> 01:56:53.940]  You have a a system that can support 20 cows
[01:56:55.620 --> 01:56:58.580]  Instead of one for that same amount of acreage
[01:56:59.860 --> 01:57:03.140]  and all he did and I i'm not sure if this was um,
[01:57:03.940 --> 01:57:04.900]  uh
[01:57:04.900 --> 01:57:10.500]  through don, uh, the the johnson-sue bioreactor and his compost if or if it was from uh,
[01:57:11.220 --> 01:57:17.220]  One of dr. Elaine ingham studies that I got these images from but it was is from one of the two
[01:57:17.700 --> 01:57:20.180]  But you can obviously see it worked I mean
[01:57:20.980 --> 01:57:25.220]  And I I think it was dr. Elaine that worked on the george w bush
[01:57:26.020 --> 01:57:29.700]  uh facility and they took it from a parking lot that had
[01:57:30.180 --> 01:57:34.340]  Oil all over it because they used to park big trucks there and stuff and it was it was garbage
[01:57:34.340 --> 01:57:36.340]  They had to strip all that soil out
[01:57:36.580 --> 01:57:39.300]  And and you know bring in some half-ass fresh soil
[01:57:39.700 --> 01:57:46.180]  And she took that ground that brand new soil where we know everything that was in it was basically destroyed
[01:57:46.180 --> 01:57:50.660]  There was no soil structure. There was really no biology left in it or very little
[01:57:51.460 --> 01:57:55.140]  She took that and when they designed it they had a a pond
[01:57:55.780 --> 01:57:59.140]  They were supposed to have and they're supposed to be you know water running into the pond
[01:57:59.540 --> 01:58:04.100]  And they weren't allowed to bring in anything that didn't already exist
[01:58:04.340 --> 01:58:06.420]  They weren't allowed to fill that pond up with water
[01:58:06.420 --> 01:58:11.220]  They weren't allowed to use seeds that didn't exist in that area of the world
[01:58:11.860 --> 01:58:13.860]  You know in in history
[01:58:14.180 --> 01:58:19.300]  Okay, so when she put all this together she's working with dirt there's nothing there
[01:58:19.940 --> 01:58:21.060]  Okay
[01:58:21.060 --> 01:58:28.100]  But as the system developed over time and if I remember right they'd had two mils or two inches of rain in the spring
[01:58:28.660 --> 01:58:32.100]  And that was the only rain they got all year and it was before they actually had started
[01:58:32.980 --> 01:58:36.820]  By the end of the the summer though the pond had filled up with water
[01:58:38.420 --> 01:58:39.840]  So
[01:58:39.840 --> 01:58:41.060]  understanding
[01:58:41.060 --> 01:58:46.500]  Your biology you understand that the more we create aggregates in our soil and the more
[01:58:46.980 --> 01:58:49.780]  We create passages in our soil for the water
[01:58:50.340 --> 01:58:52.900]  to penetrate and come down
[01:58:53.780 --> 01:59:00.020]  The more it comes down deeper and deeper and as our biology moves deeper and deeper and deeper it goes deeper and deeper and deeper
[01:59:00.100 --> 01:59:02.260]  And holy fuck i'm getting way too deep here
[01:59:02.980 --> 01:59:04.980]  but what happens is
[01:59:05.540 --> 01:59:07.460]  It wasn't the rain
[01:59:07.460 --> 01:59:09.940]  That filled that pond. It was the dew
[01:59:11.540 --> 01:59:18.900]  In natural farming if you're going to make a a fermented plant juice you go out as the sun is coming up
[01:59:19.860 --> 01:59:26.020]  And you grab those leaves and you bring it home and you make your your plant juice. You don't want them to dry out. So
[01:59:26.740 --> 01:59:27.620]  Why?
[01:59:27.620 --> 01:59:32.420]  I'm the why guy? Okay. I always want to know why do it this way?
[01:59:33.300 --> 01:59:37.620]  Why is this is is the biology doing it this way and not this way?
[01:59:38.420 --> 01:59:40.900]  The why of the the water
[01:59:42.100 --> 01:59:44.100]  coming into the system
[01:59:44.500 --> 01:59:50.980]  And why you pick your plants very early in the morning before the sun comes up is your plants grow at night
[01:59:51.780 --> 01:59:54.820]  You know, we've heard that your kid grows like a bad weed
[01:59:55.540 --> 01:59:58.120]  Okay, or he sprouted up overnight
[01:59:58.740 --> 02:00:05.060]  It's because they do because when our brain stops and leaves our body our consciousness goes to sleep
[02:00:05.620 --> 02:00:10.180]  The microbiology takes over and takes everything that you've brought into your body
[02:00:11.140 --> 02:00:13.140]  The food you've eaten
[02:00:13.380 --> 02:00:20.420]  And it takes those compounds and it creates your new cells whether you're a child and you just had a growth spurt
[02:00:21.060 --> 02:00:24.660]  Or you're you know an old crazy idiot like me
[02:00:25.220 --> 02:00:31.700]  You know and you're just trying to you know, not make this too gray and not lose too much
[02:00:31.700 --> 02:00:37.460]  Everything you consume is is there but in the soil system for the water
[02:00:38.900 --> 02:00:44.740]  It's bringing that it's opening it up so the water can penetrate and the more it penetrates all of a sudden
[02:00:45.300 --> 02:00:47.140]  The more is available
[02:00:47.140 --> 02:00:49.140]  To fill that pond
[02:00:49.300 --> 02:00:53.780]  And that's what happened there. She created enough biology and enough
[02:00:54.580 --> 02:00:57.780]  Life in the soil system that it opened it up enough
[02:00:57.780 --> 02:01:04.420]  So in the in the very early morning because you know the temperature change your vapor pressure deficit again
[02:01:04.900 --> 02:01:07.700]  Creates the moisture on the leaf structure of the plant
[02:01:07.780 --> 02:01:14.580]  It was allowed to come down to the stem and come down into the roots and go out in the soil system
[02:01:14.820 --> 02:01:16.820]  And there was enough access
[02:01:18.260 --> 02:01:24.180]  In that system where everything turned green and she had water where there shouldn't have been
[02:01:24.180 --> 02:01:29.940]  Everything turned green and she had water where there shouldn't have been water because they hadn't had rain
[02:01:31.780 --> 02:01:38.660]  But she had the biology that allowed that moisture to be collected by her plants now in I think it's
[02:01:40.480 --> 02:01:42.740]  Chihuahua or something I can't pronounce it
[02:01:43.300 --> 02:01:45.780]  But he's living in Mexico in a desert
[02:01:46.260 --> 02:01:48.260]  Where they even get even less rain
[02:01:48.740 --> 02:01:50.740]  And yet he was able to capture
[02:01:51.620 --> 02:01:53.060]  the moisture
[02:01:53.060 --> 02:01:58.440]  From the different temperature from that vapor pressure deficit where at that certain point it forms h2o
[02:02:00.020 --> 02:02:02.760]  Onto the the surface of the plant and that's why you're collecting
[02:02:03.460 --> 02:02:08.200]  that very early in the morning because that is when your biology
[02:02:09.300 --> 02:02:13.780]  And the nutrients they're bringing to create that cell for the leaf structure
[02:02:14.260 --> 02:02:18.440]  Is at the tip of the leaf structure and that's what you want. You want that biology?
[02:02:19.220 --> 02:02:21.460]  And you want nutritional value?
[02:02:21.780 --> 02:02:23.780]  Because
[02:02:24.500 --> 02:02:27.560]  The microbiology if you need one atom of calcium
[02:02:28.340 --> 02:02:31.700]  For this, uh cell for your leaf. It's there
[02:02:32.180 --> 02:02:37.860]  It's already been broken down and and is ready to go into the cell and you're taking that
[02:02:38.980 --> 02:02:42.580]  And you're fermenting it in your your fermented plant juice
[02:02:43.460 --> 02:02:48.440]  And all of a sudden you're concentrating all those atomic values
[02:02:49.160 --> 02:02:52.540]  Together that's already been broken down by the biology
[02:02:53.560 --> 02:02:58.040]  And made available to the plant right inside the plant ready to go into a cell
[02:02:59.080 --> 02:03:03.980]  And you're giving it to you this new plant or into your body. You want chlorophyll?
[02:03:04.600 --> 02:03:07.560]  Hey, there you go. Drink some drink some fermented plant juice
[02:03:08.520 --> 02:03:10.200]  Okay
[02:03:10.200 --> 02:03:13.080]  So we'll stop there and we'll go to the next slide, please peter
[02:03:19.230 --> 02:03:20.510]  Bugs
[02:03:20.510 --> 02:03:21.630]  Oh
[02:03:21.630 --> 02:03:25.150]  Baby, here's a big one that we all love
[02:03:25.790 --> 02:03:31.950]  Don't you just love spider mites guys? I mean, come on. They're just you know telling you that your plant isn't healthy
[02:03:33.150 --> 02:03:35.470]  You know, they're they're not there to piss you off
[02:03:36.350 --> 02:03:41.950]  They're just going uh, you know, this isn't fit for human consumption as layton says because it's not
[02:03:43.710 --> 02:03:45.710]  Bugs are
[02:03:46.410 --> 02:03:48.410]  Beneficial
[02:03:48.670 --> 02:03:50.190]  Or
[02:03:50.190 --> 02:03:51.790]  They're not
[02:03:51.790 --> 02:03:53.550]  Or they're both
[02:03:53.550 --> 02:03:57.970]  Because in some instances that spider mite can actually be beneficial
[02:03:59.150 --> 02:04:04.110]  Don't ask me if it's ever beneficial in the cannabis plant, but you know, there's got to be a situation
[02:04:04.190 --> 02:04:10.670]  It's like it's like the pseudomonas it exists in in all these different levels doing the same job
[02:04:11.710 --> 02:04:19.550]  Or a little bit different of a job in each level of the atmosphere of terra firma inside the the water system
[02:04:20.590 --> 02:04:21.710]  You know
[02:04:21.710 --> 02:04:24.750]  The spider mites are telling you that you have a problem
[02:04:26.270 --> 02:04:30.510]  and I and and I was supposed to actually give kudos to to uh,
[02:04:30.830 --> 02:04:35.550]  a guy named john burfello at the very beginning and I I didn't even go into to
[02:04:35.950 --> 02:04:40.590]  Saying how much I love this community and and and peter and layton and brian
[02:04:40.990 --> 02:04:44.590]  Because I do I love you guys. You guys you guys are my type of people
[02:04:45.310 --> 02:04:52.050]  Um, I have the same moral values that you guys do it's all about caring and sharing and community
[02:04:52.590 --> 02:04:53.470]  um
[02:04:53.470 --> 02:04:58.510]  But john burfello and and he's not in the soil and actually I haven't watched his latest videos
[02:04:58.510 --> 02:05:01.870]  He may have moved because I have actually seen him on
[02:05:02.110 --> 02:05:02.510]  uh
[02:05:02.510 --> 02:05:04.670]  the chat on one of the the past shows
[02:05:05.230 --> 02:05:10.190]  And I actually sent him an email told him he should come on because I was going to talk about him at the beginning
[02:05:10.270 --> 02:05:13.470]  But sorry, sorry johnny when you watch this later
[02:05:14.750 --> 02:05:16.250]  he
[02:05:16.250 --> 02:05:18.510]  documented his journey
[02:05:20.270 --> 02:05:22.270]  Of problems in his garden and
[02:05:22.990 --> 02:05:26.030]  he's a guy that I and I don't think I mentioned this but
[02:05:27.070 --> 02:05:29.070]  he actually was one of the the
[02:05:29.790 --> 02:05:31.230]  people that
[02:05:31.230 --> 02:05:35.630]  Created medical cannabis in canada. He's one of the guys that fought for it
[02:05:36.030 --> 02:05:40.190]  Uh with the government now, he's an injured work, uh injured worker. He was um,
[02:05:40.590 --> 02:05:46.350]  He put glass into buildings and uh, he took a really bad fall and and really fucked himself up
[02:05:47.390 --> 02:05:53.310]  He'd always been into cannabis. He's always been growing cannabis. He's actually won a couple of cannabis cups
[02:05:53.710 --> 02:05:55.710]  um with his medicush
[02:05:56.110 --> 02:05:58.030]  um
[02:05:58.030 --> 02:06:04.030]  But he has documented his journey. It's kind of like smiley. I see you there you sexy bitch
[02:06:04.110 --> 02:06:09.710]  I'm pissed at you because now I got a whole bunch of more videos that i'm gonna have to watch to see your journey
[02:06:10.510 --> 02:06:14.770]  Because that's how I learned I follow john or or smiley
[02:06:15.710 --> 02:06:17.710]  And I go back in time
[02:06:18.430 --> 02:06:24.510]  And I'll watch his journey. What did he do for this problem? And was it successful or not?
[02:06:25.790 --> 02:06:32.510]  I don't care what the scientist says. I look at the guy that's in the trenches that is doing it
[02:06:33.310 --> 02:06:35.310]  Did he have success and john burfello?
[02:06:36.270 --> 02:06:37.950]  He has had uh
[02:06:37.950 --> 02:06:39.950]  issues with with spider mites
[02:06:40.270 --> 02:06:41.230]  um
[02:06:41.230 --> 02:06:46.990]  Literally going on years. Okay. Now he's went through. Um, you know changing his his
[02:06:47.870 --> 02:06:50.990]  watering techniques what he was using he um
[02:06:51.870 --> 02:06:53.310]  picked up a uh
[02:06:53.310 --> 02:06:59.230]  an ultraviolet thing that they actually sent him a welding helmet and and these big gloves that come up to
[02:06:59.470 --> 02:07:05.650]  The top of it almost his shoulder because they're so dangerous and he was going around and going around his plants
[02:07:06.270 --> 02:07:07.310]  and
[02:07:07.310 --> 02:07:08.890]  Did it work?
[02:07:08.950 --> 02:07:10.950]  Partially
[02:07:11.690 --> 02:07:12.890]  But
[02:07:12.890 --> 02:07:18.810]  the last time I watched he was following something that we've learned from um
[02:07:19.930 --> 02:07:23.370]  Oh my gosh, I slip in my brain. Uh
[02:07:24.150 --> 02:07:29.070]  Mushrooms, they live in canada. They're 100 organic. They make the mushroom compounds
[02:07:30.010 --> 02:07:31.770]  You guys have had them on
[02:07:31.770 --> 02:07:33.770]  dragonfly
[02:07:34.730 --> 02:07:39.290]  Oh, it just popped in my head right or I think layton you just sent that to me
[02:07:39.850 --> 02:07:42.570]  I totally beamed it into you brother and i'll try to be quicker
[02:07:43.690 --> 02:07:49.770]  No doubt. Hey, uh, so it's microbiology. They're not bringing it out fast enough. I haven't got him trained, right?
[02:07:50.490 --> 02:07:52.490]  So anyway dragonfly earth medicine
[02:07:53.290 --> 02:07:55.290]  they went to europe and
[02:07:56.170 --> 02:07:58.170]  They went to the um
[02:07:58.330 --> 02:08:00.330]  Uh, it was ponsettias
[02:08:00.490 --> 02:08:07.610]  Uh into the the big huge huge miles and miles and miles worth of
[02:08:08.950 --> 02:08:15.210]  Greenhouses and if you don't understand ponsettias your christmas beautiful red plant
[02:08:16.090 --> 02:08:17.290]  the
[02:08:17.290 --> 02:08:20.250]  Margin on profit for them is in the pennies
[02:08:20.890 --> 02:08:22.170]  per plant
[02:08:22.170 --> 02:08:24.170]  They can't afford to spray chemicals
[02:08:24.890 --> 02:08:26.890]  so in the history
[02:08:27.850 --> 02:08:33.290]  Because they actually keep records, okay, uh, they don't have video logs, but they wrote everything down
[02:08:33.850 --> 02:08:38.570]  Okay, and I don't and I know I should I know I know, you know, I get shit all the time
[02:08:39.110 --> 02:08:40.330]  anyway
[02:08:40.330 --> 02:08:42.490]  they went through those records and found that
[02:08:43.050 --> 02:08:46.650]  geez if they raised the heat up to a certain point
[02:08:47.450 --> 02:08:48.330]  and
[02:08:48.330 --> 02:08:53.610]  They didn't stress to plan out because they kept the the vapor pressure deficit in balance at that temperature
[02:08:54.250 --> 02:08:56.570]  That they could actually cook off
[02:08:57.850 --> 02:08:59.850]  bugs that were bothering them
[02:09:01.210 --> 02:09:08.730]  But it was a function of temperature and bpd in combination so they weren't damaging the plant now john
[02:09:10.170 --> 02:09:15.530]  That was the last um segment. I really watched he actually went into his grow
[02:09:16.730 --> 02:09:22.490]  Into this hundred plus degree temperature. So basically into a sauna and sat there with his plants
[02:09:23.290 --> 02:09:25.290]  To see if it was going to work
[02:09:25.450 --> 02:09:26.810]  now
[02:09:26.810 --> 02:09:28.570]  I know it's going to work
[02:09:28.570 --> 02:09:30.410]  Okay, we all know it's going to work
[02:09:30.410 --> 02:09:37.470]  By by the work that dragonfly did and going back into histories and studying what has been done there for decades
[02:09:39.370 --> 02:09:44.730]  But it's not allowed here because it wasn't developed here you want to know about cannabis look at
[02:09:45.290 --> 02:09:48.170]  countries like israel and iran and the the
[02:09:48.810 --> 02:09:54.330]  Doctors and the medical professions there that have been researching this for hundreds of years
[02:09:54.650 --> 02:10:01.210]  Okay, there's one country where if you're old and you go into a home the first thing they do is put you on a cannabis
[02:10:02.010 --> 02:10:03.530]  regiment
[02:10:03.530 --> 02:10:05.530]  Because they don't want you to hurt
[02:10:06.010 --> 02:10:09.770]  We're not supposed to hurt at the end of our lives. We're supposed to enjoy it
[02:10:09.770 --> 02:10:14.250]  We're supposed to have smiles and grins and and the love of family and friends there
[02:10:15.770 --> 02:10:21.850]  So they actually start you as soon as you go in there on cannabis because they know it helps because they've done the research but
[02:10:21.850 --> 02:10:24.490]  Western medicine. Oh, no. No it
[02:10:25.530 --> 02:10:30.090]  Don't look over here. Don't look at this. We have to do the work. It's got to be us that
[02:10:30.810 --> 02:10:32.810]  invents it
[02:10:32.810 --> 02:10:37.690]  No, man, most of this shit's been invented decades and decades and decades ago
[02:10:39.530 --> 02:10:41.530]  But to go back to the
[02:10:41.930 --> 02:10:43.930]  To dragonfly and john burfello
[02:10:44.650 --> 02:10:46.650]  I went back in that gentleman's life
[02:10:46.650 --> 02:10:52.910]  I think he started his channel about eight years ago, and I started watching from the very beginning of his experiences
[02:10:54.010 --> 02:10:56.010]  And I watched how he went from
[02:10:56.570 --> 02:10:58.010]  double-ended
[02:10:58.010 --> 02:11:04.090]  And he went to you know through the hps and he went through the plasma and he went through the different
[02:11:05.050 --> 02:11:09.930]  LEDs from one that he got like years ago to the new technology
[02:11:10.490 --> 02:11:12.570]  And I've watched his progress
[02:11:12.810 --> 02:11:18.970]  But he's also shared his failures so I don't have to make his same failure if
[02:11:19.530 --> 02:11:21.530]  You know i pay attention
[02:11:22.330 --> 02:11:27.930]  Then I don't have to repeat lessons that he has learned he has given that to me
[02:11:28.570 --> 02:11:34.010]  And to he actually has his own community on youtube and i've never actually spoken to him
[02:11:34.570 --> 02:11:38.170]  And he's never actually talked to me and he's never actually talked to me
[02:11:38.170 --> 02:11:43.530]  To he actually has his own community on youtube and i've never actually spoken to this gentleman
[02:11:44.090 --> 02:11:48.890]  Before I sent him an email last night about coming on to the the show so I could you know
[02:11:49.450 --> 02:11:53.930]  Say john, I I love you, and I love what you're doing and I love what you've given back
[02:11:55.530 --> 02:11:57.530]  Okay, um
[02:11:57.610 --> 02:12:00.490]  I would love to see him on this show speaking about his
[02:12:01.190 --> 02:12:06.510]  Experiences in battling these spider mites and and the progression of knowledge that he has acquired
[02:12:07.470 --> 02:12:10.990]  In his battle because I know it will help this community
[02:12:11.790 --> 02:12:13.790]  in your battle with these bugs, but
[02:12:14.350 --> 02:12:16.510]  Bugs to go back to the slide
[02:12:17.390 --> 02:12:19.150]  are an indicator
[02:12:19.150 --> 02:12:24.830]  Now you've got your book good bugs and you've got your bad bugs. You've got good bacteria. You've got bad bacteria
[02:12:24.830 --> 02:12:30.030]  You've got good fungi. You've got bad fungi. You've got one nematode. That's gonna stab your root
[02:12:30.110 --> 02:12:34.110]  And he's an asshole and you want to get rid of them, but the rest of them
[02:12:34.830 --> 02:12:36.830]  You want
[02:12:36.830 --> 02:12:39.470]  But that one nematode that's gonna stab your root
[02:12:40.750 --> 02:12:42.750]  Can only exist
[02:12:43.230 --> 02:12:46.190]  If the conditions are right if the conditions aren't right
[02:12:47.150 --> 02:12:49.150]  He's gonna curl up and go to endostasis
[02:12:49.950 --> 02:12:52.030]  And he's gonna wait for the conditions to be right
[02:12:53.150 --> 02:12:54.590]  you think of
[02:12:54.590 --> 02:12:56.590]  You know, we mentioned events
[02:12:56.890 --> 02:13:03.150]  Underwater events and through volcanoes and they're finding that there's life there. They never thought there was bloody life there
[02:13:03.630 --> 02:13:05.790]  Of course, we couldn't get down that deep before
[02:13:06.350 --> 02:13:10.770]  But when they discovered there was life there was they're in awe. These are our scientists
[02:13:11.310 --> 02:13:13.550]  Okay, these are the people we're supposed to respect
[02:13:14.350 --> 02:13:20.990]  You know and they're going well, you know, this this is you know wild where the hell did this come from? This shouldn't be possible
[02:13:21.870 --> 02:13:23.870]  Nothing is impossible guys
[02:13:24.990 --> 02:13:28.270]  Everything is possible. We've just been taught
[02:13:28.910 --> 02:13:33.950]  And it's been driven and driven in it's impossible no you can't do that
[02:13:35.150 --> 02:13:40.190]  You can't jump off the top of that bridge and not go splat at the bottom
[02:13:41.790 --> 02:13:48.270]  Yeah, actually you can you attach yourself to a bungee cord, you know, then you just bounce a few times
[02:13:50.030 --> 02:13:53.470]  But we've been trained and it's been forced down our
[02:13:53.630 --> 02:14:00.510]  Our energy our psyche our mind that no that's impossible you can't walk on water
[02:14:01.230 --> 02:14:03.230]  You can't walk on
[02:14:03.550 --> 02:14:05.550]  coals from a fire
[02:14:05.790 --> 02:14:11.070]  Of course unless you're a firework walker and you do the meditation first and train yourself to do it
[02:14:12.990 --> 02:14:14.990]  If you're living in fear
[02:14:16.350 --> 02:14:18.350]  Of doing something
[02:14:19.390 --> 02:14:22.030]  Then you're in trouble you want to
[02:14:22.510 --> 02:14:29.330]  You want to get out of fear and the only way to do that to truly do that is to understand
[02:14:30.350 --> 02:14:33.410]  And confront that fear now take a firefighter
[02:14:34.670 --> 02:14:37.390]  This is a person that isn't running away
[02:14:38.270 --> 02:14:39.530]  They're running
[02:14:39.530 --> 02:14:40.830]  towards
[02:14:40.830 --> 02:14:42.830]  They're gonna run in and save your ass
[02:14:43.950 --> 02:14:47.710]  Okay, but why don't they live in the fear of fire?
[02:14:48.590 --> 02:14:51.650]  Because they understand it. They know how it functions
[02:14:52.270 --> 02:14:58.910]  They know how you know flame will go up over here and move across here and go down here compared
[02:14:59.470 --> 02:15:01.710]  How the the airflow is in the building?
[02:15:02.430 --> 02:15:07.230]  Most of the time it's not flame that gets a firefighter. It's the building collapsing around him
[02:15:08.190 --> 02:15:13.550]  He doesn't fear it because he understands it if you understand something you don't have to fear it
[02:15:15.550 --> 02:15:19.950]  And that's where we move need to move to we need to get out of the fear based
[02:15:20.590 --> 02:15:25.790]  Gain enough understanding so we don't have to so we don't go into fight or flight
[02:15:26.910 --> 02:15:30.750]  So we're still in control our minds are still in control
[02:15:31.710 --> 02:15:36.910]  Not the biology taking over and going look jump left because that car is about to hit you buddy
[02:15:38.830 --> 02:15:40.830]  That's flight that's fear that's
[02:15:41.630 --> 02:15:44.590]  Taking your brain and who you are
[02:15:45.230 --> 02:15:47.230]  out of the picture totally
[02:15:47.370 --> 02:15:49.150]  unless
[02:15:49.150 --> 02:15:52.750]  You understand that. Okay, that car is coming in at this angle
[02:15:53.710 --> 02:15:54.910]  and
[02:15:54.910 --> 02:15:57.230]  If I move six inches to the left
[02:15:58.110 --> 02:16:00.110]  I'm gonna be out of the way of that car
[02:16:00.830 --> 02:16:06.910]  And so you've taken back control and you take that side step that's six inches and watch the car go by
[02:16:08.750 --> 02:16:17.150]  But if you're living in fear and your body freezes and you can't make your body move that six inches
[02:16:19.550 --> 02:16:22.270]  Yeah, well, you know i'll visit you in the hospital how's that say
[02:16:23.550 --> 02:16:25.150]  Okay
[02:16:25.150 --> 02:16:25.950]  so
[02:16:25.950 --> 02:16:27.230]  the fear
[02:16:27.230 --> 02:16:29.230]  Oh, and there's one of my pussycats
[02:16:29.550 --> 02:16:31.470]  The fear is what motivates us
[02:16:31.550 --> 02:16:36.510]  It's the keeping up with the joneses because I want to have as much as that guy has I want that boat
[02:16:36.590 --> 02:16:41.230]  I want that quad, you know, I want that car, you know guys I want that
[02:16:42.170 --> 02:16:44.590]  bodacious blonde blue-eyed, baby
[02:16:45.950 --> 02:16:47.070]  You know
[02:16:47.070 --> 02:16:49.070]  So you go after that?
[02:16:49.310 --> 02:16:54.430]  okay, you're trying to bring that to you and that's a function of the fear of
[02:16:55.870 --> 02:17:02.910]  I don't have that and I want it because i'm seeing buddy over here and he's got that blonde bodacious wife
[02:17:03.630 --> 02:17:05.870]  He's also a freaking millionaire and you're not
[02:17:07.310 --> 02:17:09.310]  Okay, so
[02:17:09.390 --> 02:17:11.390]  living in fear forces you
[02:17:12.270 --> 02:17:18.910]  to go out and work those extra hours and do those extra things that you might not have done and you may have
[02:17:19.150 --> 02:17:20.590]  have lived
[02:17:20.590 --> 02:17:22.670]  more in a pleasure of not
[02:17:24.110 --> 02:17:26.990]  Working and going to the park and sitting there in nature
[02:17:27.630 --> 02:17:29.630]  And and feeding your soul
[02:17:30.190 --> 02:17:35.390]  Not your pocket book to try to obtain something that you don't actually need
[02:17:36.590 --> 02:17:38.190]  well
[02:17:38.190 --> 02:17:45.470]  You know, some guys would say i'm total lunatics. They need that, you know wife and blonde bodacious is always better
[02:17:45.950 --> 02:17:52.270]  But when it comes down to it, what do you truly need you need food and shelter, you know clothes on your back
[02:17:54.350 --> 02:17:58.670]  You know you you need the basic components of life
[02:17:59.790 --> 02:18:02.190]  For the plant that's and silk clay organic material
[02:18:03.710 --> 02:18:05.710]  You know for us it's
[02:18:05.790 --> 02:18:11.950]  the same basic freaking components because our cells are made from the same components as
[02:18:12.270 --> 02:18:14.270]  What the plant needs
[02:18:14.350 --> 02:18:19.070]  Needs what an animal needs what my cat needs or my dogs need
[02:18:20.910 --> 02:18:22.910]  Is we need to figure out
[02:18:23.710 --> 02:18:26.110]  How to supply that and that's where your weeds
[02:18:27.310 --> 02:18:29.390]  your earliest transitional plants
[02:18:30.590 --> 02:18:32.590]  Are the ones that are in that book
[02:18:33.470 --> 02:18:37.230]  That the person reads to go. Oh, I need this plant to treat this
[02:18:38.910 --> 02:18:43.950]  I need to ferment it or dry it make a tea out of it make a poultice out of it, you know
[02:18:44.670 --> 02:18:46.910]  make an fpj make the the
[02:18:48.110 --> 02:18:50.770]  Oh and the oriental herbal nutrient
[02:18:51.390 --> 02:18:52.510]  um
[02:18:52.510 --> 02:18:54.610]  What it is. Is it what is an apothecary?
[02:18:55.390 --> 02:19:01.150]  What is somebody that's gathering all this stuff going out in nature and yes give back
[02:19:02.190 --> 02:19:03.950]  Yes, give back
[02:19:03.950 --> 02:19:06.750]  Even if it's just your soul and you're thanking
[02:19:08.510 --> 02:19:11.470]  For that material you're taking always give back
[02:19:12.190 --> 02:19:14.190]  Okay
[02:19:14.590 --> 02:19:18.110]  But when you are combining all of this
[02:19:18.810 --> 02:19:20.430]  genetic by
[02:19:20.430 --> 02:19:25.390]  Diverse material and you're adding it to your system or your body
[02:19:26.590 --> 02:19:32.510]  You're taking from nature and you're drawing it into this little bubble that you exist in
[02:19:34.190 --> 02:19:37.790]  Because you only exist in this particular time
[02:19:38.750 --> 02:19:43.710]  In this particular body for so long and then the expiration date
[02:19:44.590 --> 02:19:46.590]  Goes poof you're gone
[02:19:47.150 --> 02:19:48.270]  now
[02:19:48.270 --> 02:19:54.110]  We can pass a lot earlier. We can pass it off later. We can have a good life. We can have a bad life
[02:19:54.350 --> 02:19:57.570]  We can be the guy that's always out there working enslaving
[02:19:58.350 --> 02:20:03.630]  and layton can speak to this because he had the two houses and the nice car and the nice wife and
[02:20:04.430 --> 02:20:06.430]  And all of a sudden it all collapsed
[02:20:07.230 --> 02:20:12.350]  And he was working his ass off. He couldn't spend time. He couldn't spend joy with his children
[02:20:12.510 --> 02:20:16.830]  He didn't have the time because he was paid chasing the mighty dollar
[02:20:18.110 --> 02:20:21.790]  Now he's looking back and going. Holy shit, man. What was I doing?
[02:20:22.750 --> 02:20:24.750]  That's not a life
[02:20:25.870 --> 02:20:30.110]  Okay, anyway, let's uh, I i'm a i'm a ranter i'm sorry
[02:20:30.670 --> 02:20:34.990]  I know you guys like rats sometimes but well, it's it's nice to not be the ranter
[02:20:37.070 --> 02:20:39.070]  Okay, layton, you know, I I
[02:20:39.150 --> 02:20:43.230]  I'll take that on with with the love and respect that you just meant from that
[02:20:45.310 --> 02:20:46.430]  Peter
[02:20:46.430 --> 02:20:48.430]  Are you there my friend?
[02:20:48.830 --> 02:20:54.110]  We'll take the next slide. Hey, I gotta i'm gonna keep you on speaker, but I gotta bounce for a second
[02:20:54.190 --> 02:20:56.930]  But i'll be hearing it. Oh sure fantastic
[02:20:58.430 --> 02:21:02.510]  Energy flow the human bio energetic field
[02:21:03.630 --> 02:21:07.070]  This is where we get into you know, the aura and the woohoo
[02:21:07.710 --> 02:21:11.010]  And but I already explained that in with karelian photography
[02:21:11.950 --> 02:21:13.950]  They can actually show this
[02:21:14.990 --> 02:21:16.990]  with modern technology
[02:21:17.550 --> 02:21:20.990]  And they can show us our aura they can show us our plants aura
[02:21:22.430 --> 02:21:25.150]  Now an interesting experiment that I ran across
[02:21:25.710 --> 02:21:31.810]  I don't know half dozen years ago or a dozen years ago was two scientists that were working with karelian photography
[02:21:32.590 --> 02:21:34.350]  And they had a plant
[02:21:34.350 --> 02:21:35.950]  in in their
[02:21:36.030 --> 02:21:41.010]  Enclosure in their booth and their their bubble to make sure that nothing else could interfere
[02:21:41.710 --> 02:21:48.430]  You know, um their scientific experiment they had to have these processes in line because that's how they had to write it
[02:21:49.230 --> 02:21:50.350]  Okay
[02:21:50.350 --> 02:21:53.790]  Back in in when this was done. We could still smoke everywhere
[02:21:54.430 --> 02:21:56.430]  Okay, so buddy goes in
[02:21:57.310 --> 02:22:01.730]  To the the booth with the plant to check on the moisture content. I can't remember exactly
[02:22:02.430 --> 02:22:05.630]  But he had a cigarette in his hand and he accidentally burnt the plant
[02:22:06.910 --> 02:22:09.150]  No big deal, right? It's just a fucking plant
[02:22:10.350 --> 02:22:14.530]  The problem was is his buddy that's sitting in front of the monitor on the outside
[02:22:15.230 --> 02:22:17.870]  And looking at this aura that surrounds the plant
[02:22:18.750 --> 02:22:20.750]  saw a reaction
[02:22:21.230 --> 02:22:26.670]  The plant on the energetic end of it moved back
[02:22:27.950 --> 02:22:32.670]  It moved away from that guy from that pain. This leaf structure couldn't
[02:22:33.470 --> 02:22:35.470]  Plants can't move like that
[02:22:35.710 --> 02:22:38.830]  But its energy actually moved back
[02:22:40.830 --> 02:22:42.830]  The next day
[02:22:42.910 --> 02:22:45.250]  When buddy went back in there, he didn't have a cigarette
[02:22:46.430 --> 02:22:52.290]  And he wasn't gonna do any damage to the plant obviously, but when he walked into that enclosure
[02:22:54.350 --> 02:22:56.610]  The plant had a reaction
[02:22:58.430 --> 02:23:00.430]  It had a reaction to his
[02:23:01.050 --> 02:23:03.050]  energetic field
[02:23:03.290 --> 02:23:04.470]  His
[02:23:04.470 --> 02:23:08.570]  Bio-energetic field or his aura his soul whatever you want to call it
[02:23:09.370 --> 02:23:10.710]  the plant
[02:23:10.710 --> 02:23:12.710]  recognized the guy that heard it
[02:23:13.850 --> 02:23:15.850]  And reacted to him
[02:23:18.010 --> 02:23:23.530]  Now this is something that everybody should understand that we affect
[02:23:24.570 --> 02:23:27.610]  Everything there's been enough scientific studies on music
[02:23:28.330 --> 02:23:33.130]  And the different forms of music and frequency that you can put into
[02:23:34.410 --> 02:23:35.530]  You know
[02:23:35.530 --> 02:23:36.970]  your grow
[02:23:36.970 --> 02:23:43.530]  Because they've been doing this for decades and they found that rock and roll music ain't the best but opera or
[02:23:44.870 --> 02:23:48.110]  Classical music has the right frequencies
[02:23:49.290 --> 02:23:51.930]  That the plants will actually respond to
[02:23:54.090 --> 02:23:55.770]  Now
[02:23:55.770 --> 02:23:59.050]  Most people probably don't even know that those experiments have been done
[02:23:59.930 --> 02:24:03.770]  You know, and we're talking, you know, 10 20 30 40 years ago
[02:24:04.730 --> 02:24:11.050]  You know these experiments were done. Why don't we all know this? Why isn't it in the books that we read?
[02:24:11.130 --> 02:24:13.450]  Why isn't being taught to the teachers that teach us?
[02:24:14.330 --> 02:24:16.330]  because that interconnection
[02:24:16.330 --> 02:24:18.330]  with the energetic
[02:24:18.730 --> 02:24:24.410]  We're not supposed to understand that we're not supposed to know that because when we do we start seeing and feeling
[02:24:25.210 --> 02:24:27.210]  Things that maybe the
[02:24:28.330 --> 02:24:31.550]  Suits don't want us to know they don't want us to understand
[02:24:33.930 --> 02:24:38.250]  You know, it's it's like if if you have read what is on the the screen
[02:24:39.130 --> 02:24:40.470]  is the uh
[02:24:40.470 --> 02:24:42.470]  systemic self-organic
[02:24:42.790 --> 02:24:44.790]  self-directed
[02:24:44.950 --> 02:24:49.290]  Self-regulating self-healing self. You guys can read it. I
[02:24:50.250 --> 02:24:52.250]  You know, my eyes are bad and i'm not wearing my glasses
[02:24:52.810 --> 02:24:56.730]  But the physical processes of the body
[02:24:57.850 --> 02:25:00.090]  Are all ran through that energetic field
[02:25:00.090 --> 02:25:06.250]  We talked about the brain sending synaptic signals to the muscle and that's how you're going to move forward and walk
[02:25:07.850 --> 02:25:09.370]  But
[02:25:09.370 --> 02:25:11.370]  It's more than that
[02:25:12.730 --> 02:25:15.930]  When we pass and our energy leaves our body
[02:25:16.650 --> 02:25:18.650]  What starts to happen immediately?
[02:25:19.450 --> 02:25:22.410]  Or forthwith if you want to use the old english term
[02:25:23.850 --> 02:25:27.610]  The biology that's in your body already that's creating that cell
[02:25:28.490 --> 02:25:30.490]  switches functions
[02:25:30.490 --> 02:25:32.570]  It's no longer creating that cell
[02:25:33.610 --> 02:25:38.250]  It is taking that cell and breaking it down into its component parts
[02:25:39.610 --> 02:25:42.910]  To feed back to the next generation as soon as your energy
[02:25:43.550 --> 02:25:48.430]  That exists in your body your connection to this physical form leaves
[02:25:50.270 --> 02:25:54.190]  Your start your microbiology is starting to compost you
[02:25:56.110 --> 02:26:00.190]  Okay, you see an animal on the side of the road that got hit by a vehicle and it and
[02:26:00.510 --> 02:26:05.950]  If you're driving that route, you might see that the first day the second day the third day and you see the progression of his
[02:26:06.590 --> 02:26:12.750]  As his belly is slowly bloating and bloating and bloating and all of a sudden it pops and out comes blow flies and maggots
[02:26:13.390 --> 02:26:15.390]  Those were already in the system
[02:26:15.550 --> 02:26:17.550]  When the energy left the body
[02:26:18.190 --> 02:26:21.950]  they turned around and that biology started breaking down that body because
[02:26:23.150 --> 02:26:27.890]  That's the cycle of life. We're supposed to be returned back in our component
[02:26:28.830 --> 02:26:31.550]  parts and at the atomic level
[02:26:32.510 --> 02:26:34.510]  To the system for the next generation
[02:26:35.450 --> 02:26:37.450]  Everything is in succession
[02:26:38.030 --> 02:26:39.790]  You are born
[02:26:39.790 --> 02:26:41.790]  You come up through adolescence
[02:26:43.070 --> 02:26:44.750]  You breed
[02:26:44.750 --> 02:26:46.430]  You get old
[02:26:46.430 --> 02:26:47.790]  You die
[02:26:47.790 --> 02:26:50.910]  And you go back into the system
[02:26:51.710 --> 02:26:53.710]  for the following generation
[02:26:54.510 --> 02:26:55.950]  you've already
[02:26:55.950 --> 02:26:58.750]  Broken down the materials that you have eaten
[02:26:59.310 --> 02:27:00.570]  into
[02:27:00.570 --> 02:27:02.270]  available
[02:27:02.270 --> 02:27:04.830]  for another human body or for a plant or for an
[02:27:05.450 --> 02:27:09.730]  Animal you've broken that down already. You fermented it inside yourself
[02:27:10.430 --> 02:27:12.430]  or your microbiology has
[02:27:13.070 --> 02:27:17.810]  And when you die, it's supposed to go back into the system for the next generation
[02:27:19.950 --> 02:27:25.730]  When we strip everything out of our field we know that we're fucking ourselves
[02:27:27.390 --> 02:27:31.070]  That's why we talk about cover crops that's why we talk about chop and drop
[02:27:31.950 --> 02:27:39.070]  You know, we want to feed that back in but we want to feed it at that level where it's already been
[02:27:39.070 --> 02:27:43.230]  Stripped from the soil and created into an element
[02:27:44.030 --> 02:27:50.030]  That is ready to be at the tip of that leaf to be added to that particular cell
[02:27:51.150 --> 02:27:53.630]  To create that particular leaf
[02:27:54.990 --> 02:27:56.990]  And a function of color
[02:27:57.470 --> 02:28:03.150]  If you understand art at all, there's only the base colors and every other color
[02:28:03.870 --> 02:28:05.710]  Is created from that
[02:28:05.710 --> 02:28:07.710]  base set of colors
[02:28:07.790 --> 02:28:09.710]  Base set of colors
[02:28:09.710 --> 02:28:11.710]  I think it's black white and yellow
[02:28:11.870 --> 02:28:15.470]  I mean, I I can't remember. I just asked the wife. She doesn't remember either
[02:28:16.030 --> 02:28:16.990]  but
[02:28:16.990 --> 02:28:18.990]  I thought it was roy g biv
[02:28:19.630 --> 02:28:21.310]  Okay
[02:28:21.310 --> 02:28:26.830]  yeah, I i'm so far removed from uh, uh when I took an art class in elementary school, I
[02:28:27.630 --> 02:28:29.630]  I don't can't remember
[02:28:29.710 --> 02:28:35.250]  But the primary colors you have your primary nutrients your calcium your magnesium
[02:28:35.890 --> 02:28:37.890]  Um your sulfur etc
[02:28:38.610 --> 02:28:43.350]  But what are those made of they're made of primal elements in a specific combination
[02:28:44.290 --> 02:28:47.430]  To create that atom of say calcium
[02:28:48.610 --> 02:28:53.590]  But if you don't have that particular building block, you can't create calcium
[02:28:55.570 --> 02:28:57.570]  You know, it's it's just not going to be available
[02:28:58.610 --> 02:29:02.130]  but when you take it down to the really the basics
[02:29:03.010 --> 02:29:04.210]  of
[02:29:04.210 --> 02:29:06.210]  each
[02:29:06.690 --> 02:29:08.690]  Each thing we'll call it
[02:29:08.690 --> 02:29:12.310]  At an atomic level and you get down that small
[02:29:13.010 --> 02:29:16.050]  And that's where you have to be to be able to create a cell
[02:29:17.010 --> 02:29:21.090]  Is is in that little thing where we build a house?
[02:29:22.130 --> 02:29:24.050]  Because we're big and it's got to be big
[02:29:24.130 --> 02:29:30.310]  Well, if we got shrunk down to the size of a bacteria and we looked at a grain of sand
[02:29:30.870 --> 02:29:38.170]  I think that probably looked like a freaking everest or a whole group of mountains to the microbiology
[02:29:39.830 --> 02:29:43.930]  You know and they're going in there to mine that and they're going in there for very specific
[02:29:44.710 --> 02:29:46.710]  elements that they need
[02:29:47.270 --> 02:29:49.590]  to create something whether that's
[02:29:50.150 --> 02:29:53.050]  uh another the next generation of biology
[02:29:54.070 --> 02:29:56.070]  or their offspring
[02:29:56.790 --> 02:29:58.790]  They need to have those
[02:29:59.110 --> 02:30:05.830]  At the atomic level to be able to take the next step in the in the generation of the soil system
[02:30:06.550 --> 02:30:11.030]  And without it just like the color if you don't have the the right colors
[02:30:11.750 --> 02:30:15.590]  Then mr. Toad, he's never going to be able to bring out that beautiful red
[02:30:16.550 --> 02:30:18.950]  That he's looking for in that granddaddy purple
[02:30:19.830 --> 02:30:21.830]  it's never going to turn purple because
[02:30:22.310 --> 02:30:28.010]  The different combination of elements that create purple isn't there it isn't available
[02:30:28.870 --> 02:30:30.050]  for that
[02:30:30.050 --> 02:30:33.030]  Genetic to express itself in any way
[02:30:34.150 --> 02:30:37.270]  shape or form it just can't happen
[02:30:37.910 --> 02:30:44.170]  And you go back to the analogy of of the the restaurant and you're ticking off what's going to be in your hamburger
[02:30:44.790 --> 02:30:46.950]  If that element isn't there well that hamburger
[02:30:47.670 --> 02:30:52.070]  Has a totally different genetic profile than the hamburger you really wanted
[02:30:52.550 --> 02:30:55.750]  So when mr. Toad started breeding he wanted this
[02:30:56.310 --> 02:30:58.310]  but he got this because
[02:30:59.030 --> 02:31:01.190]  Lord thundering there was no tomatoes that day
[02:31:02.790 --> 02:31:04.630]  Okay, so
[02:31:04.630 --> 02:31:09.750]  When we look at it really taking it actually not going in
[02:31:10.630 --> 02:31:12.630]  but going out
[02:31:12.790 --> 02:31:15.030]  and looking at the whole picture
[02:31:15.910 --> 02:31:22.870]  Of how an atom is made and combined with another atom to create the next substance
[02:31:22.950 --> 02:31:29.750]  Just like you have to have the succession in the biology in your soil. You have to have the succession of the nutrients
[02:31:30.610 --> 02:31:34.570]  available to the biology to build the next generation
[02:31:35.670 --> 02:31:36.630]  and
[02:31:36.630 --> 02:31:42.950]  If there's something missing you can only go so far until that element is added by us the farmer
[02:31:43.590 --> 02:31:46.310]  Or by the biology with quorum sensing
[02:31:47.350 --> 02:31:49.990]  to create those particular atoms
[02:31:50.870 --> 02:31:52.870]  To go to the next level
[02:31:54.310 --> 02:31:58.470]  You look at the the progression in the in the first image that we showed of the circle
[02:31:59.190 --> 02:32:01.190]  Was it everything had to be?
[02:32:01.670 --> 02:32:05.670]  enough of the prey for the predator to consume
[02:32:06.390 --> 02:32:10.310]  Because if all the prey is gone the predator can't exist because it's going to starve
[02:32:10.630 --> 02:32:13.430]  Does the one have to come before the other?
[02:32:15.190 --> 02:32:21.130]  And is genetic potential just ticking off the blocks of what is available
[02:32:23.350 --> 02:32:26.390]  To express the genetic potential how does
[02:32:27.190 --> 02:32:32.710]  Okay, um latin you got brown hair dark eyes if your wife has brown hair dark eyes
[02:32:32.790 --> 02:32:36.630]  You're generally going to get a child that has brown hair and dark eyes
[02:32:37.590 --> 02:32:42.150]  What happens when you're there and the child comes out and it's got blue hair and
[02:32:44.310 --> 02:32:46.310]  Blonde hair and blue eyes
[02:32:47.510 --> 02:32:50.310]  Okay, the brain fart, okay
[02:32:51.510 --> 02:32:53.830]  Where did you come up with blue hairs? I know i'm in trouble
[02:32:54.870 --> 02:32:59.830]  When you're going hey, man, did the milkman have blonde hair, you know
[02:33:00.550 --> 02:33:02.550]  You know not that we'd ever go there
[02:33:03.110 --> 02:33:08.310]  Well, actually we probably would that probably be the first thought of the guy would have in his head is okay, baby, uh
[02:33:09.270 --> 02:33:11.270]  Okay, you better explain this
[02:33:12.070 --> 02:33:14.310]  And you ask your wife and she goes. Oh, yeah
[02:33:15.030 --> 02:33:22.550]  I I remember a story my grandmother used to tell about her great great great grandfather that married a swede that had blonde hair and blue
[02:33:22.610 --> 02:33:24.610]  eyes
[02:33:24.870 --> 02:33:27.270]  So that's where that genetic potential came from
[02:33:28.230 --> 02:33:30.230]  But why didn't when you're
[02:33:30.230 --> 02:33:35.270]  Combined with your wife who both had dark hair and dark eyes and maybe you've had two or three children before
[02:33:35.430 --> 02:33:37.430]  And they've had dark hair and dark eyes
[02:33:38.070 --> 02:33:43.610]  Why is your third child coming out blonde hair and blue eyes? Does your wife not have the prerequisite?
[02:33:45.190 --> 02:33:46.130]  um
[02:33:46.130 --> 02:33:52.550]  Atomic values in her body because she's the one that's creating that child if she doesn't have
[02:33:53.510 --> 02:33:57.110]  The stuff that's going to create the brown in the hair
[02:33:58.070 --> 02:34:00.790]  But she has the stuff that'll create the blonde in the hair
[02:34:01.990 --> 02:34:03.990]  Is that why?
[02:34:04.390 --> 02:34:06.390]  You have the blonde hair and blue eyes come out
[02:34:07.590 --> 02:34:13.750]  Because the base genetic potential at this level is mainly your mother and your father
[02:34:14.630 --> 02:34:15.670]  and it
[02:34:15.670 --> 02:34:19.510]  Although everything is there going back to the whole history of your family
[02:34:20.070 --> 02:34:25.830]  On the genetic potential level and the genes that are available for the microbiology to read
[02:34:26.390 --> 02:34:28.390]  Or you to pick the menu items
[02:34:29.270 --> 02:34:33.830]  If something's missing and it can't make the brown hair and the green eyes
[02:34:34.150 --> 02:34:38.390]  And but it does have what's necessary for blonde hair and blue eyes
[02:34:39.030 --> 02:34:41.030]  Is that where?
[02:34:41.430 --> 02:34:43.430]  We have the blonde hair and blue eyes come out
[02:34:44.550 --> 02:34:46.550]  Is the planting control?
[02:34:47.110 --> 02:34:49.110]  Of its genetic potential
[02:34:50.150 --> 02:34:55.990]  No, mr. Toad is because mr. Toad is the one that picked this mother and this father. So is mr. Toad now god
[02:34:56.790 --> 02:34:57.750]  No
[02:34:57.750 --> 02:35:03.990]  Mr. Toad is a hell of a nice guy, but you know, maybe he does need a sainthood, you know for what he's done for people
[02:35:04.150 --> 02:35:06.150]  But he's not god
[02:35:06.630 --> 02:35:08.970]  You know, he's just taking the potential
[02:35:09.750 --> 02:35:15.190]  That he recognizes in this and this and combining it and really hoping for the best
[02:35:16.070 --> 02:35:19.750]  But he is putting his energy in so the planet is going to read that energy
[02:35:19.750 --> 02:35:22.790]  So like it reads the music and the frequency of the music
[02:35:23.670 --> 02:35:28.950]  To to relax and be in homeostasis, you know happy and groovy, baby
[02:35:29.670 --> 02:35:30.630]  You know
[02:35:30.630 --> 02:35:32.630]  but the actual
[02:35:32.870 --> 02:35:34.870]  what's available to
[02:35:35.110 --> 02:35:36.210]  that
[02:35:36.210 --> 02:35:40.550]  Biology to go. Okay. I'm sorry. I don't have this i've got to have this
[02:35:41.350 --> 02:35:47.430]  You know, um, and i've got an excess of this so hey, let's make it red hair instead of blonde
[02:35:48.390 --> 02:35:55.130]  It'd be interesting to know what's under the british isles where you know in the in the I think it's the iris that are mainly red-haired
[02:35:55.830 --> 02:36:02.870]  What's is there an excess of iron that the plants are growing up from the soil and they're feeding that so they have an excess of?
[02:36:03.090 --> 02:36:06.550]  iron which is has the genetic component of
[02:36:07.030 --> 02:36:12.310]  The the tint of red and is that why they have more red hair than you know blonde or brunette
[02:36:13.350 --> 02:36:20.710]  Is there something missing in in norway that they have more blonde than brunette or more blonde than than a brunette?
[02:36:21.510 --> 02:36:27.990]  Is it a function of what's in our soil and what our plants are actually able to access which means what that's what our animals?
[02:36:27.990 --> 02:36:35.350]  Are able to access which is what we are accessing from the plants and animals into our system and the mother's going
[02:36:35.830 --> 02:36:42.070]  You know when her biology forms and the genetic potential forms if we don't have those particular elements
[02:36:42.390 --> 02:36:44.390]  Is that is what is forcing?
[02:36:44.870 --> 02:36:46.050]  and i'm saying
[02:36:46.050 --> 02:36:47.830]  forcing
[02:36:47.830 --> 02:36:51.190]  a different genetic potential to express itself
[02:36:52.070 --> 02:36:53.110]  now
[02:36:53.110 --> 02:36:57.110]  Brandon rust. Oh my god. That man is fucking on another level
[02:36:57.670 --> 02:37:03.510]  Okay, i'll never be that guy. Okay. I just I just don't have his mind in that way
[02:37:04.070 --> 02:37:05.830]  But he's taking
[02:37:05.830 --> 02:37:13.610]  You know, uh the genetic potential of his plant and he's manipulating what he's giving it both in light and in nutrients
[02:37:14.710 --> 02:37:19.270]  To express the different things that he wants expressed in that plant
[02:37:20.790 --> 02:37:25.830]  And if he takes that extra molecule of calcium away from the plant
[02:37:26.630 --> 02:37:28.630]  And stresses her
[02:37:28.870 --> 02:37:30.870]  He gets a different outcome
[02:37:31.510 --> 02:37:35.690]  than if he gave her an extra molecule of calcium
[02:37:36.390 --> 02:37:38.390]  And didn't stress her
[02:37:39.190 --> 02:37:44.550]  So when you look at that man, and if you want to go that route, I mean my god, that's the man to follow
[02:37:45.190 --> 02:37:47.830]  Do you want to go through living soil while latent?
[02:37:48.470 --> 02:37:51.830]  You know, I would follow latent, you know, not off a cliff man
[02:37:51.830 --> 02:37:57.430]  You were off a bridge, but I go I go down I go down the rabbit hole with that man any day of the week
[02:37:57.510 --> 02:37:58.470]  Okay
[02:37:58.470 --> 02:38:00.150]  Okay, but
[02:38:00.150 --> 02:38:03.530]  Is it all a form of potential and what's available?
[02:38:05.510 --> 02:38:07.510]  That actually is what
[02:38:07.750 --> 02:38:13.350]  Really allows us to express our own bodies our plants bodies our animals bodies
[02:38:14.150 --> 02:38:20.230]  So what we're my wife keeps going like this. Okay, come on. Come on. Come on. We'll go to the next slide peter
[02:38:20.790 --> 02:38:30.910]  I'm actually I have I have the thing up on on my screen and i'm trying to keep I think we were on the last slide
[02:38:32.670 --> 02:38:34.670]  Oh, yeah, maybe
[02:38:34.670 --> 02:38:38.510]  It's been slide 20. Uh, yeah. Yeah, you're right. Okay
[02:38:38.990 --> 02:38:44.190]  I I haven't done this presentation since uh last fall because of of the vid
[02:38:44.830 --> 02:38:46.110]  You know
[02:38:46.110 --> 02:38:48.110]  Okay, so we'll get off the slides
[02:38:48.110 --> 02:38:53.550]  And uh, we talked about genetic potential and I I made notes because I wanted to make sure I I hit the high points of
[02:38:54.110 --> 02:39:00.750]  why I think the way I think and the the pathway that I have went through to come to
[02:39:01.310 --> 02:39:05.950]  What I think maybe and i'm not saying it is the truth. I'm saying it's maybe the truth
[02:39:06.510 --> 02:39:10.030]  Okay, so we've covered the think tanks. We've covered quorum sensing
[02:39:11.310 --> 02:39:14.610]  Um colored, uh covered the cravings
[02:39:15.330 --> 02:39:21.410]  Paint um grain of sand. I thought I had that slide in there. Um
[02:39:24.130 --> 02:39:26.130]  In a grain of sand
[02:39:26.290 --> 02:39:28.290]  They didn't experiment
[02:39:28.290 --> 02:39:32.050]  where they uh looked at sand from all over our planet
[02:39:33.010 --> 02:39:35.170]  and they basically came out with the the
[02:39:35.970 --> 02:39:37.970]  there's a baseline of
[02:39:39.010 --> 02:39:41.010]  ingredients in the sand
[02:39:41.250 --> 02:39:43.250]  Okay, so that's that's the baseline
[02:39:44.210 --> 02:39:45.650]  Okay
[02:39:45.650 --> 02:39:46.850]  so
[02:39:46.850 --> 02:39:47.970]  if
[02:39:47.970 --> 02:39:53.810]  Everywhere on the planet has the basically the same sand or particles in the sand
[02:39:55.010 --> 02:39:55.970]  Okay
[02:39:55.970 --> 02:39:57.250]  um
[02:39:57.250 --> 02:40:01.970]  and one grain of sand and and I I don't know if i'm i'm uh
[02:40:02.290 --> 02:40:05.970]  Going to be exactly correct on this and i'm not sure where I even caught this from
[02:40:06.530 --> 02:40:13.330]  But somebody had said that one grain of sand has enough calcium in it to supply I believe was one or ten acres
[02:40:13.730 --> 02:40:16.450]  Of cannabis plants for the entire grow
[02:40:18.930 --> 02:40:20.930]  Now I can't remember what layton
[02:40:21.810 --> 02:40:28.850]  uh, so it depends on what type of sand it is because there's calcitic sand and then there's uh,
[02:40:29.390 --> 02:40:33.730]  Silica based but you're right. There is a there is a tremendous amount of
[02:40:34.050 --> 02:40:36.850]  Uh raw nutrient in that material
[02:40:37.490 --> 02:40:40.370]  So hence, why aren't you have sand in your plants peeps?
[02:40:41.490 --> 02:40:43.330]  Well, yeah, exactly
[02:40:43.330 --> 02:40:44.050]  now
[02:40:44.050 --> 02:40:50.770]  Because I went back in history and i've watched fcp from basically at least all the living soil or most
[02:40:51.010 --> 02:40:53.270]  Probably about 90 of the living soil conversations
[02:40:53.970 --> 02:40:55.330]  um
[02:40:55.330 --> 02:40:59.890]  I'll bring you back in time to a show where layton was talking about his aquaponic system
[02:41:00.530 --> 02:41:03.010]  and uh in the picture, um
[02:41:03.490 --> 02:41:06.450]  With me it shows the two plants and me in the middle
[02:41:06.770 --> 02:41:09.490]  Uh in behind you you kind of see a bit of wood
[02:41:09.810 --> 02:41:16.050]  That was actually an aquaponics, uh flood and drain breath that I had built and I ran my own aquaponic system for a while
[02:41:16.450 --> 02:41:18.450]  um, actually about three years but
[02:41:19.730 --> 02:41:20.930]  the
[02:41:20.930 --> 02:41:26.690]  The key that I want to bring to your attention is something that layton noticed in a system that he was working with
[02:41:27.170 --> 02:41:32.930]  And this wasn't one of the dirty systems where he went in and got sick because you know, the the shit was bad
[02:41:33.570 --> 02:41:37.810]  This isn't one that that maybe it's the guys from fishbrew even um
[02:41:38.450 --> 02:41:45.650]  No, this is actually a thousand gallon system that I had. Oh, okay. Okay. Um when you discovered sand in your system
[02:41:47.010 --> 02:41:51.410]  And you went well where the hell I don't I never put any sand in how the hell did the sand get here?
[02:41:52.690 --> 02:41:54.690]  Is it possible layton that?
[02:41:55.490 --> 02:41:59.970]  That there was an excess of the nutrients in your system
[02:42:01.010 --> 02:42:03.010]  and the microbiology
[02:42:03.250 --> 02:42:05.250]  took those excesses
[02:42:05.650 --> 02:42:07.650]  And had the genetic code
[02:42:08.130 --> 02:42:09.650]  to create that
[02:42:09.650 --> 02:42:11.650]  grain of sand
[02:42:11.730 --> 02:42:17.730]  By putting all of that together and that's where the sand came from. Would you think that would possible? Um, so
[02:42:18.610 --> 02:42:23.090]  I reached out to a good friend of mine. Dr. Kevin Fitzsimmons out of u of a
[02:42:23.730 --> 02:42:27.090]  I had done some work with them years ago and
[02:42:27.890 --> 02:42:31.650]  I said to him I go look I don't understand all i'm putting is water food
[02:42:32.130 --> 02:42:35.330]  And fish and yet all of a sudden I get sand in the clarifier
[02:42:35.410 --> 02:42:40.870]  Where is this coming from and he basically bitch slapped me. He said, you know where it's coming from. It's called remineralization
[02:42:41.810 --> 02:42:45.410]  And it's the same thing as what we were talking about earlier, which is these geo
[02:42:46.670 --> 02:42:48.670]  biological chemical
[02:42:48.730 --> 02:42:53.150]  Reactions that are happening that are way beyond our comprehension at this point in time
[02:42:53.550 --> 02:42:57.150]  but basically pulling mineral out of the water and
[02:42:57.790 --> 02:43:01.170]  forming crystal through these biological and chemical reactions
[02:43:01.870 --> 02:43:07.230]  So that's that's where it came from but it's it, you know again, this is so fucking complex. It's not funny
[02:43:08.190 --> 02:43:14.990]  Okay, but if we step back latin and take it out of the complex and don't put ourselves so close to the problem
[02:43:15.310 --> 02:43:17.070]  And take the overview
[02:43:17.070 --> 02:43:19.970]  Could it possibly be that there was the excess?
[02:43:20.670 --> 02:43:22.670]  And that a grain of sand
[02:43:23.390 --> 02:43:28.350]  Is actually the plant's way or the microbiology's way. Sorry of
[02:43:28.890 --> 02:43:31.630]  storage a fridge a freezer
[02:43:33.070 --> 02:43:36.770]  Because dude, you know, yeah, that's absolutely
[02:43:37.690 --> 02:43:39.690]  Totally a reality
[02:43:39.870 --> 02:43:40.990]  You know
[02:43:40.990 --> 02:43:42.270]  Go ahead
[02:43:42.270 --> 02:43:48.430]  So when you discovered that sand it actually took you a while to actually see it you didn't see the first grain
[02:43:49.150 --> 02:43:51.150]  Uh, the human mind isn't set up that way
[02:43:51.150 --> 02:43:53.150]  We're actually if you get into marketing
[02:43:53.230 --> 02:43:57.550]  You can can learn that if you see a sign on the side of the highway a billboard
[02:43:57.870 --> 02:44:00.830]  You actually have to drive by that sign seven times
[02:44:01.390 --> 02:44:06.910]  And your subconscious mind has to see it before your subconscious mind is going to drag your conscious mind
[02:44:07.150 --> 02:44:09.710]  To actually see and recognize that sign and read it
[02:44:10.670 --> 02:44:15.710]  Okay, so you had to actually have that sand in there, uh long enough
[02:44:16.350 --> 02:44:18.450]  And there had to be enough created
[02:44:19.390 --> 02:44:25.170]  For your eye to see it because sand particles can be pretty freaking small and it's underwater
[02:44:26.190 --> 02:44:32.270]  But you saw that because you were in tune with your system. You went well, what the what the fuck's going on?
[02:44:33.230 --> 02:44:40.050]  But if that's it well actually to be honest with you it was because I was harvesting the biology
[02:44:41.230 --> 02:44:43.230]  And using that biology
[02:44:43.550 --> 02:44:47.630]  to stimulate uh compost or make products with it
[02:44:48.350 --> 02:44:49.310]  that
[02:44:49.310 --> 02:44:55.150]  You know when I sifted out the the liquid there was always a pile of sand on the bottom of the bucket
[02:44:55.230 --> 02:44:57.470]  And that's where you know, that's where all that came from
[02:44:58.350 --> 02:45:03.250]  Yeah, it was their fridge and you just emptied their fridge you rotten bugger
[02:45:05.630 --> 02:45:07.630]  It's doing the work man, sorry
[02:45:08.270 --> 02:45:11.870]  Yeah, man. Hey, it's my job, you know, come on
[02:45:12.990 --> 02:45:13.790]  so
[02:45:13.790 --> 02:45:18.350]  If that is the case and it and it was because there was an excess in the system
[02:45:19.390 --> 02:45:24.910]  And that's their the uh, our microbiology or our planet's, you know storage system
[02:45:25.710 --> 02:45:31.630]  That's when we talk about going in and wild crafting different colors of sand because it has stuff in it
[02:45:32.590 --> 02:45:34.590]  The sand that has nothing in it
[02:45:35.390 --> 02:45:38.350]  Maybe that sand that was formed from actual rock
[02:45:39.230 --> 02:45:41.230]  And wasn't formed by the biology
[02:45:41.790 --> 02:45:45.630]  Because the biology is putting in that particle of sand
[02:45:46.590 --> 02:45:52.830]  Everything that it would need to create new biology new plant material new human material
[02:45:53.710 --> 02:46:00.910]  Etc where the white sand that has nothing in it. Maybe that's just mother nature grinding up some rock
[02:46:01.870 --> 02:46:03.870]  But anything that's biology
[02:46:04.030 --> 02:46:07.310]  Based on the biology is going to have the sand silt
[02:46:07.870 --> 02:46:08.730]  clay
[02:46:08.730 --> 02:46:10.830]  component in it and the the
[02:46:11.530 --> 02:46:12.590]  genetic
[02:46:12.590 --> 02:46:13.610]  uh
[02:46:13.610 --> 02:46:18.030]  Sequencing in that grain of sand to not only create that grain of sand
[02:46:18.590 --> 02:46:25.550]  Because each element that makes up a grain of sand does it have the genetic code embedded in it
[02:46:26.270 --> 02:46:28.270]  to create a grain of sand
[02:46:29.230 --> 02:46:31.230]  All right, let me pose a question to you
[02:46:31.710 --> 02:46:36.750]  Please in some of my earlier work. Uh, I was I took a slab of granite
[02:46:37.310 --> 02:46:40.190]  Yeah, put it on my bridge saw cut it took the mud
[02:46:40.750 --> 02:46:45.230]  Went down to uh, rodale put it under a microscope and it was a lot
[02:46:46.110 --> 02:46:48.350]  So that led me to the conclusion that
[02:46:49.290 --> 02:46:54.030]  Everything is alive. The rock itself is alive. So maybe inside that grain of sand
[02:46:54.750 --> 02:47:00.030]  Is some of that biology that we talk about that lives inside the spore of a fungi
[02:47:00.670 --> 02:47:07.870]  That is a whole new world that we can't even unlock because it's so complex and so small. We don't have the tools
[02:47:08.430 --> 02:47:09.210]  or
[02:47:09.210 --> 02:47:11.210]  bandwidth to really understand
[02:47:11.530 --> 02:47:18.650]  What those processes are so think of pixels they go out forever and they go infinitely small forever
[02:47:19.770 --> 02:47:23.210]  We'll we probably in our lifetime. We'll never be able to explain
[02:47:24.170 --> 02:47:28.250]  Why there is biological life embedded in fucking stone?
[02:47:29.850 --> 02:47:31.290]  Just saying
[02:47:31.290 --> 02:47:33.290]  If you ever ran across, um
[02:47:33.370 --> 02:47:39.770]  I'm, not sure if it was in russia where they had drilled up approximately three miles the deepest hole in the world
[02:47:40.090 --> 02:47:45.930]  Yeah, yeah, and they did they brought up the samples of rock and it was alive and they split it open
[02:47:46.570 --> 02:47:52.490]  Did you ever learn what the life cycle of that but uh biology was? Oh, dude, it's crazy
[02:47:52.890 --> 02:47:56.890]  It's fucking crazy. It's the same as the sediment on the bottom of the ocean
[02:47:58.470 --> 02:48:05.370]  Geological time. Well, yeah, the bacteria's life cycle is something like a thousand years
[02:48:06.330 --> 02:48:13.210]  From from birth to or divide to to death or or to maturity enough to split again
[02:48:13.530 --> 02:48:17.050]  Yeah, yeah thousand years. I mean, it's just it's mind boggling
[02:48:17.690 --> 02:48:21.370]  Now think of that saying exact same bacteria being on the surface
[02:48:21.930 --> 02:48:25.150]  And in a week going through 10 000 generations
[02:48:27.690 --> 02:48:30.970]  See we we are are so fucking arrogant
[02:48:31.930 --> 02:48:36.890]  That we think we understand this shit and we don't we don't have a clue I don't have a clue
[02:48:37.130 --> 02:48:43.770]  I'm, i'm learning and growing every day and the more I consume from people like layton and uh, mr
[02:48:43.830 --> 02:48:45.830]  toad and you know
[02:48:46.090 --> 02:48:51.450]  If I started listing people, you know, I i'd be here freaking all day. Okay. Um
[02:48:52.490 --> 02:48:57.530]  You can learn all this stuff, but it's the understanding behind it. It's it's the why?
[02:48:57.770 --> 02:48:58.730]  Why
[02:48:58.730 --> 02:49:06.730]  Why would in the center of a rock that's three miles or two miles or even five feet under the ground as a solid structure?
[02:49:07.130 --> 02:49:08.630]  or what we
[02:49:08.630 --> 02:49:09.930]  consider
[02:49:09.930 --> 02:49:11.930]  a solid structure
[02:49:12.250 --> 02:49:15.530]  Because if you look at the table that you're sitting behind
[02:49:17.130 --> 02:49:19.870]  On the atomic level the atoms are vibrating
[02:49:20.890 --> 02:49:25.050]  There's gaps in between. How does a nutrient get through the cell wall?
[02:49:25.290 --> 02:49:28.490]  Because there's gaps there man because we can't see it
[02:49:29.850 --> 02:49:33.450]  If we go small enough and small enough and small enough
[02:49:34.170 --> 02:49:36.150]  maybe it's
[02:49:36.150 --> 02:49:38.150]  huge
[02:49:38.570 --> 02:49:44.570]  Huge thing like walking through a park walking through a forest to microbiology going. Oh, man
[02:49:44.570 --> 02:49:46.570]  Look at all this shit down here, man
[02:49:47.050 --> 02:49:49.050]  we we
[02:49:49.530 --> 02:49:55.530]  We want to phrase things in what we understand what we know in our lives because
[02:49:56.250 --> 02:49:58.730]  Where how did you get to the point you are?
[02:49:59.770 --> 02:50:02.270]  In your life in your education and your understanding
[02:50:03.050 --> 02:50:06.650]  It started from birth and everything that has happened in your life
[02:50:07.450 --> 02:50:12.730]  Has created your understanding to this point. So if you were a blind man
[02:50:13.770 --> 02:50:16.810]  And I told you that uh red
[02:50:17.450 --> 02:50:18.730]  Was
[02:50:18.730 --> 02:50:21.770]  What we as a seeing person would call blue
[02:50:22.170 --> 02:50:28.490]  And I gave you a pair of glasses that gave you the capability to see when you saw red
[02:50:29.690 --> 02:50:31.690]  Or when you saw blue
[02:50:31.690 --> 02:50:34.330]  You wouldn't call it blue. You call it red
[02:50:34.970 --> 02:50:36.970]  Because that's what I taught you
[02:50:37.930 --> 02:50:42.170]  So it's a function of what you have been taught all your life
[02:50:42.170 --> 02:50:49.530]  All your life from the moment you were born the can the can't the this the that to the
[02:50:50.790 --> 02:50:58.730]  Everything to the experiences you've had that has brought you to this exact moment at this time
[02:50:59.130 --> 02:51:04.430]  Your understanding of everything that's happened in your life has created your personality
[02:51:05.290 --> 02:51:07.290]  and your understanding
[02:51:08.010 --> 02:51:10.010]  There's nothing saying that
[02:51:10.650 --> 02:51:13.310]  You know you were taught reality
[02:51:15.050 --> 02:51:17.050]  We've known all along
[02:51:17.450 --> 02:51:20.170]  that we're being lied to by the
[02:51:21.050 --> 02:51:22.730]  you know the the
[02:51:22.730 --> 02:51:29.470]  Growth shop about what we need for our cannabis. We've passed through that progression of knowledge
[02:51:30.650 --> 02:51:32.490]  to get to this point
[02:51:32.490 --> 02:51:37.290]  And all science is is a progression of knowledge and the more the equipment comes out
[02:51:37.770 --> 02:51:44.570]  The more they can actually see and understand and the more knowledge that that we are able to obtain
[02:51:45.930 --> 02:51:49.290]  But some of that knowledge science can't explain it
[02:51:50.970 --> 02:51:56.970]  Only on the energetic level can it be explained can it be explained that why does
[02:51:57.990 --> 02:52:00.090]  Classical music affects your plant
[02:52:00.890 --> 02:52:06.170]  In a positive way or rock and roll affects your plant in a negative way
[02:52:07.290 --> 02:52:09.290]  Okay, it's a basis of frequency
[02:52:10.490 --> 02:52:12.910]  It's a basis of balance of frequency
[02:52:13.850 --> 02:52:15.850]  when you get into
[02:52:16.090 --> 02:52:18.090]  Excuse me
[02:52:18.570 --> 02:52:23.130]  The the art of the solar system and solar light and you get into
[02:52:23.770 --> 02:52:26.810]  uh buying your components you need to buy
[02:52:27.290 --> 02:52:28.970]  a component
[02:52:28.970 --> 02:52:33.130]  um that takes the 12 volt and converts it over to
[02:52:33.610 --> 02:52:37.770]  Uh, the 110 or if you're in europe, it's a it's a different thing but
[02:52:38.810 --> 02:52:40.810]  there's a difference between uh
[02:52:41.130 --> 02:52:44.650]  An inverter that uses a pure sine wave
[02:52:45.610 --> 02:52:48.490]  And one that does it in the pure sine wave
[02:52:48.650 --> 02:52:54.250]  It's up and down in the gentle flow and the one that doesn't it's up it spikes
[02:52:54.250 --> 02:52:58.090]  It comes across and it drops and it just it's it's goes like that
[02:52:58.810 --> 02:53:04.590]  There's a lot of stuff like my laptop I cannot plug into uh an inverter
[02:53:05.530 --> 02:53:10.890]  That doesn't use a pure sine wave because the energy flow doesn't match
[02:53:12.490 --> 02:53:17.370]  Okay, so if you're ever building a soil or sorry a solar system
[02:53:18.170 --> 02:53:20.190]  These are the kind of things you need to understand
[02:53:20.970 --> 02:53:23.930]  Is that the waveform that you're using?
[02:53:24.890 --> 02:53:31.370]  Has to match it's like, uh, you know using 12 volt compared to 120 volts or you you know
[02:53:31.370 --> 02:53:38.970]  You plug in something that is supposed to be using 110 you plug it into a 240 outlet. Well, it's cooked
[02:53:40.410 --> 02:53:48.650]  But can you take it from a 240 and plug something that uses um a 240 into 120 and have it work half as well
[02:53:49.610 --> 02:53:54.810]  I I don't actually know the answer to that one. So I waited shaking his hand, you know
[02:53:55.450 --> 02:53:59.390]  Brian's going. Holy fuck man. This guy's going fucking deep
[02:54:02.570 --> 02:54:03.610]  You know
[02:54:03.610 --> 02:54:06.250]  Let's let's do this. Let's lighten it up for a minute here
[02:54:07.210 --> 02:54:12.330]  I i'm going to drag this all the way back into the conversation that I thought we were going to talk about today
[02:54:12.410 --> 02:54:14.410]  Which is the rhizosphere?
[02:54:14.730 --> 02:54:17.290]  Layton we actually have been talking about the riles
[02:54:18.010 --> 02:54:21.770]  Rises fear all along because where does the rhizosphere end?
[02:54:22.570 --> 02:54:24.410]  the plant begin
[02:54:24.410 --> 02:54:25.930]  and where does
[02:54:25.930 --> 02:54:29.930]  Who's actually in control and that that's the point that i've actually been
[02:54:30.650 --> 02:54:32.910]  Trying to make through the entire conversation
[02:54:33.530 --> 02:54:38.330]  Is who's actually in control because it's sure the fuck ain't the plant making cake and cookies
[02:54:38.890 --> 02:54:42.970]  But I think it's the microbiology that's eating the cake and cookies
[02:54:43.370 --> 02:54:49.150]  And going well I can put these components together and I can build your cell structure and I can read your dna
[02:54:49.930 --> 02:54:55.210]  And so I can make you but I I want to get paid for my work and that's where the exudates are
[02:54:55.450 --> 02:55:00.170]  they're just the food that the the biology has to have to survive, but
[02:55:01.210 --> 02:55:03.210]  Is the planting control latent?
[02:55:04.170 --> 02:55:06.170]  I'll sit back
[02:55:06.650 --> 02:55:08.890]  I think we're blatant's bouncing on and off you must be
[02:55:08.890 --> 02:55:10.330]  What
[02:55:10.330 --> 02:55:16.970]  Uh, you know, I it seems, you know, especially after talking yesterday that maybe quorum sensing is the one that's really in control
[02:55:17.690 --> 02:55:22.330]  Because that seems to be what starts the process of the communication in the first place
[02:55:22.970 --> 02:55:28.990]  But what forms quorum sensing who or or should I say who forms the the quorum sensing? It's the microbiology
[02:55:29.930 --> 02:55:31.930]  That comes together to form the quorum
[02:55:32.890 --> 02:55:37.530]  So but don't they do that from when the plant is is telling them what what she needs?
[02:55:38.490 --> 02:55:40.490]  Do you know what you need brian
[02:55:40.650 --> 02:55:44.890]  Does your wife know what she needs other than you know, when when she gets a craving?
[02:55:46.090 --> 02:55:50.890]  How does the plant know that it needs a molecule of calcium? Can it read its own genetic code?
[02:55:53.450 --> 02:55:55.450]  I posed that question brian. Yeah
[02:55:55.450 --> 02:56:02.410]  So what you're saying is that no matter what's going on the microbial world is really at the the basis of of the blueprint
[02:56:02.570 --> 02:56:04.330]  of the house
[02:56:04.330 --> 02:56:06.330]  Yeah. Yeah if if you
[02:56:07.290 --> 02:56:11.290]  Uh look at it from the the point of you know, um
[02:56:12.330 --> 02:56:15.370]  I I need all these different materials to build a house
[02:56:16.330 --> 02:56:18.090]  okay, and
[02:56:18.090 --> 02:56:22.110]  The engineer that designs your house. He has specific
[02:56:22.810 --> 02:56:29.050]  Uh codes that he has to follow and i'm not talking building codes. I'm talking. Um, if you put um
[02:56:29.770 --> 02:56:34.810]  Use a two by four to cover a 12 foot span in a roof. Does it have enough?
[02:56:35.430 --> 02:56:41.210]  Strength in it that when there's a snow load on it that it won't break your roof won't collapse
[02:56:41.210 --> 02:56:44.910]  So the engineers behind there, there's your quorum of knowledge
[02:56:45.690 --> 02:56:48.570]  that somebody or something has to have
[02:56:49.370 --> 02:56:51.210]  in order to
[02:56:51.210 --> 02:56:55.690]  create the blueprint to hand to the builder who then calls the
[02:56:56.490 --> 02:57:04.110]  Warehouse and orders all these different materials to bring to the drop site give to the worker to construct the the foundation
[02:57:04.670 --> 02:57:10.690]  And the walls and the roof and remember every single person that touches your house is a specialist
[02:57:11.150 --> 02:57:15.230]  from the guy that pours the concrete to the guy that comes out and puts
[02:57:15.630 --> 02:57:17.550]  the probe into the ground to see
[02:57:17.550 --> 02:57:24.350]  The tension of your soil because that's how wide your footing has to be because your soil has to support your house
[02:57:24.910 --> 02:57:29.230]  And if you're going two stories up the engineer has to design it in such a way
[02:57:29.870 --> 02:57:32.350]  that he knows what the the the
[02:57:32.430 --> 02:57:33.470]  um
[02:57:33.470 --> 02:57:36.110]  Tension of the ground is and I can't remember the exact term
[02:57:36.590 --> 02:57:40.110]  But he has to know that before he can design your house
[02:57:40.590 --> 02:57:46.190]  So he's the the cook in the background or the quorum sensing because he has that knowledge
[02:57:46.430 --> 02:57:52.110]  And he can combine that knowledge and create that blueprint for somebody else to follow where you know
[02:57:52.110 --> 02:57:57.330]  Your average carpenter can't do that. He can't create a blueprint. He doesn't have the understanding
[02:57:57.650 --> 02:58:03.330]  That the engineer has on okay if I have this much span
[02:58:03.810 --> 02:58:05.330]  I can't use a two by four
[02:58:05.330 --> 02:58:10.930]  I have to use a two by ten or two by twelve or I have to go to a totally different type of material
[02:58:11.090 --> 02:58:14.370]  I have to go to steel to be able to cover that span
[02:58:15.890 --> 02:58:20.690]  But the quorum is the engineer that's the the group that uh,
[02:58:21.710 --> 02:58:23.810]  biology that is able to
[02:58:24.530 --> 02:58:26.770]  Create that blueprint from nothing
[02:58:27.410 --> 02:58:32.610]  from knowing the basic of okay, uh, uh a cell needs a b and c
[02:58:33.330 --> 02:58:34.850]  and i've got
[02:58:34.850 --> 02:58:42.210]  Uh e f and g, but I don't have a so i'm going to read this genetic potential and and build it without a
[02:58:42.770 --> 02:58:46.610]  Because I don't have a and then all of a sudden I have an unhealthy plant
[02:58:47.090 --> 02:58:48.450]  because
[02:58:48.450 --> 02:58:51.010]  It needed a it needed that extra
[02:58:51.250 --> 02:58:57.890]  Uh, I needed the two by eight instead of the two by four and my roof is going to collapse and it's an unhealthy cell
[02:58:59.490 --> 02:59:03.410]  Did you uh, I think I explained that I I think I did
[02:59:05.010 --> 02:59:07.010]  Brian
[02:59:07.490 --> 02:59:09.490]  Yes, sir
[02:59:09.730 --> 02:59:11.730]  Okay
[02:59:12.690 --> 02:59:14.930]  If I explained it thoroughly enough where we're
[02:59:15.090 --> 02:59:21.890]  Sir, it's actually starting to make sense then I then that's great if I haven't i'll keep uh going and looking at it and explaining
[02:59:21.970 --> 02:59:23.970]  It in it from a different angle
[02:59:25.410 --> 02:59:31.430]  Uh, we're we're uh running to the end of this here ken and I wanted to open it up for questions
[02:59:33.970 --> 02:59:38.530]  Yes, I can hear you laden but you can't see me no you've got no video image
[02:59:39.810 --> 02:59:41.810]  Peter are you still there?
[02:59:42.130 --> 02:59:48.930]  Yeah, all right, it's not a mystery man i'm unplugging my camera is is my computer camera working
[02:59:50.290 --> 02:59:52.290]  No, no cameras working
[02:59:55.250 --> 03:00:00.930]  Let me see what the heck's going on here, I think we can name layton the man in the shadows now
[03:00:02.290 --> 03:00:04.290]  Show it. Oh, here we go
[03:00:06.050 --> 03:00:11.010]  See if this works bam, all right, oh baby he's outside having to smoke
[03:00:11.650 --> 03:00:13.650]  No, look at this peeps
[03:00:17.090 --> 03:00:19.030]  This is called a rhizosheath
[03:00:20.370 --> 03:00:26.290]  So otherwise known as a root ball and i've wanted to show aggregation. So all these little clumps
[03:00:28.050 --> 03:00:32.130]  This is an aggregate and as I take it and smash it I can turn it into dust
[03:00:33.090 --> 03:00:36.050]  So this is the bonds the the the gluk
[03:00:36.690 --> 03:00:38.690]  uh, the the um
[03:00:38.910 --> 03:00:40.530]  Glomulin
[03:00:40.530 --> 03:00:41.870]  and the
[03:00:41.870 --> 03:00:44.530]  Biofilm that is bonding these particles together
[03:00:45.010 --> 03:00:51.890]  Right breaking them down. So this this is a prime example of what we're talking about in soil aggregate
[03:00:52.530 --> 03:00:54.530]  So that was my uh, that was my
[03:00:54.930 --> 03:00:56.930]  fun for the day
[03:00:57.010 --> 03:01:02.370]  That I thought yeah, you said you brought uh brought in, you know a present for everybody and that's it
[03:01:03.010 --> 03:01:05.010]  Yep
[03:01:05.090 --> 03:01:09.490]  I figured I figured it'd be easier to just show people what we're talking about then
[03:01:10.130 --> 03:01:13.330]  To just try to explain it because it is pretty fucking complex
[03:01:14.290 --> 03:01:19.890]  Oh exactly. That's where I i've taken the overview approach where I try not to get too close
[03:01:20.610 --> 03:01:22.610]  step back and and
[03:01:23.810 --> 03:01:30.210]  Try to think of things in a way I can understand and because i'm i'm a you know, just a simple truck driver
[03:01:30.930 --> 03:01:35.730]  Yeah, right, okay, we'll scratch a truck driver you get a philosopher and a poet but we won't go there
[03:01:36.290 --> 03:01:37.250]  um
[03:01:37.250 --> 03:01:39.490]  I try to make things so simple that
[03:01:40.530 --> 03:01:42.450]  I can understand it
[03:01:42.450 --> 03:01:44.690]  Then I can explain it to somebody
[03:01:45.330 --> 03:01:51.650]  And that's where you know the the science, you know, you you start using all these big words and all of that
[03:01:52.130 --> 03:01:54.130]  and you you
[03:01:54.210 --> 03:01:55.730]  lose people
[03:01:55.730 --> 03:01:58.610]  Where I try to you know, um
[03:01:59.250 --> 03:02:00.530]  Make it so
[03:02:00.530 --> 03:02:02.930]  A five-year-old can understand what i'm talking about
[03:02:03.010 --> 03:02:09.330]  I I follow the kiss method and i'm sure layton's heard that one. Keep it simple stupid. I'm the stupid one
[03:02:09.970 --> 03:02:13.890]  Okay, because I I gotta keep it so simple that I can understand it
[03:02:14.050 --> 03:02:18.850]  I can wrap my mind around it and if I can do that in my simple way
[03:02:19.170 --> 03:02:24.210]  Then I should be able to share that for other people to actually understand and explain it in a way
[03:02:24.690 --> 03:02:26.690]  That isn't too far over their head
[03:02:27.090 --> 03:02:30.530]  So do you want to go uh, um questions brian layton
[03:02:32.450 --> 03:02:40.290]  Yeah, uh peter usually actually uh runs that too. Oh, I know I know peter's on vacation
[03:02:43.090 --> 03:02:46.550]  Shit I got fucking rhizosphere all over my computer
[03:02:49.890 --> 03:02:51.890]  Lick it up buddy
[03:02:52.530 --> 03:02:54.530]  Put some of that
[03:02:54.690 --> 03:02:58.610]  Would you add to your body if you if you you know, you take a uh, um
[03:02:59.010 --> 03:03:02.850]  A worm casting and put it in a gel cap and swallow it. Oh, yeah
[03:03:02.850 --> 03:03:07.090]  We're late and you already did that and science didn't want to know anything about it because they couldn't fucking make money
[03:03:08.370 --> 03:03:16.050]  Yep. Yeah, it's a healthy part of my lifestyle dirty fingernails compost extract in my eyes my mouth my ears
[03:03:16.370 --> 03:03:19.510]  Yeah, that's why I love natural farming more than jedam
[03:03:20.050 --> 03:03:24.050]  Because in jedam if you're not wearing a hazmat suit you can be in trouble
[03:03:24.530 --> 03:03:31.250]  You know where with the natural farming if you spill an fpj on yourself, you're not gonna start melting
[03:03:34.450 --> 03:03:40.850]  But there is definitely um jedam has its advantages in a huge way
[03:03:41.410 --> 03:03:43.410]  um for uh
[03:03:44.130 --> 03:03:46.390]  In in its in its applications
[03:03:48.530 --> 03:03:50.450]  Absolutely agree 100
[03:03:50.450 --> 03:03:55.330]  Yeah, but then so does hugo culture. So does cold compost so does hot compost?
[03:03:55.890 --> 03:04:01.490]  If we can take a combination of everything like I I said earlier if we have the available
[03:04:01.890 --> 03:04:07.670]  Um land and the the willpower and the materials we should try everything
[03:04:08.390 --> 03:04:14.630]  Find out what works personally for you diversity diversity diversity you can never go wrong because it's either
[03:04:15.250 --> 03:04:17.250]  bio stimulant or a bioinoculant
[03:04:18.210 --> 03:04:24.630]  Exactly. Exactly. You're either gonna be the predator. You're gonna be the prey baby, but we're gonna throw you in there and see what happens
[03:04:25.990 --> 03:04:27.990]  I'm ended up
[03:04:28.310 --> 03:04:33.430]  Since you brought up quorum sensing and that's kind of my topic for the week now or at least something I want to research
[03:04:34.390 --> 03:04:39.510]  Do you have uh, do you have any youtube videos or somebody that that kind of breaks it down?
[03:04:39.910 --> 03:04:42.230]  Is there anybody out there that that is like a dr
[03:04:42.230 --> 03:04:46.890]  Laningham where you can just kind of watch a few of her videos and kind of understand her ideology
[03:04:47.990 --> 03:04:55.850]  Where I first found quorum sensing was uh, dr. Uh johnson the gentleman that produces the johnson's zoo bioreactor
[03:04:57.030 --> 03:04:58.310]  and uh
[03:04:58.310 --> 03:05:03.430]  I did a deep dive just like I I did with future cannabis project and I went back
[03:05:03.830 --> 03:05:08.950]  To the first videos that I could possibly find of him talking about this system
[03:05:09.430 --> 03:05:13.030]  And that's why I know it was his wife that really you know
[03:05:13.650 --> 03:05:18.550]  Motivated him to develop it because she couldn't stand the smell of shit in the house anymore and with the
[03:05:19.410 --> 03:05:21.430]  Bioreactor you don't have to deal with it, right?
[03:05:21.590 --> 03:05:27.350]  You deal with it once when you set it up and then never again until you break it apart and then it does smell like shit
[03:05:27.910 --> 03:05:32.390]  Right, so keep the wife happy happy wife. Happy life, right?
[03:05:33.030 --> 03:05:37.670]  Um, but dr. Robert johnson, or is it david johnson shit? I can't remember
[03:05:38.710 --> 03:05:43.850]  Anyway, uh it I actually I think shango might have actually had him on his podcast
[03:05:44.630 --> 03:05:46.630]  um
[03:05:46.950 --> 03:05:48.470]  Yeah, I i've
[03:05:48.470 --> 03:05:54.310]  I follow so many people and uh, like bruce bugabey if you guys don't know about dr
[03:05:54.310 --> 03:05:55.750]  Bruce bugabey
[03:05:55.750 --> 03:05:58.470]  And you want to know about light and the different?
[03:05:59.030 --> 03:06:04.390]  Spectrums of light and what the different spectrums will do for your plant. This is a guy that
[03:06:04.950 --> 03:06:07.750]  Hasn't just done the research working for nasa
[03:06:08.870 --> 03:06:12.470]  But he's actually developed. Um equipment
[03:06:13.670 --> 03:06:19.510]  To monitor the light and the light frequencies and we're wasting a shit ton of energy guys
[03:06:20.150 --> 03:06:23.590]  Because your plant can only absorb so much
[03:06:25.030 --> 03:06:29.430]  And if you have the right instrumentation hanging in your your room
[03:06:30.310 --> 03:06:32.310]  you may be able to bring your your
[03:06:33.350 --> 03:06:37.130]  Lights down the power on your lights down by a significant margin
[03:06:37.910 --> 03:06:43.270]  Because you don't need to have it that high because your your plant can only use so much. So, um,
[03:06:44.130 --> 03:06:45.190]  apogee
[03:06:45.190 --> 03:06:46.370]  um
[03:06:46.370 --> 03:06:47.430]  instruments
[03:06:47.430 --> 03:06:53.270]  is the youtube channel where he actually has shown his progression of knowledge in
[03:06:53.750 --> 03:07:00.490]  Uh in light and going into the the blues and the reds and the different ends of the spectrum and has developed equipment
[03:07:01.190 --> 03:07:02.790]  that actually can
[03:07:02.790 --> 03:07:06.730]  Uh monitor that so you're not wasting that energy, you know exactly
[03:07:07.510 --> 03:07:10.550]  What energy you're putting into your plant just as a side note
[03:07:14.690 --> 03:07:16.690]  Uh peter are you there?
[03:07:18.920 --> 03:07:23.000]  I am he's in the chat. Sometimes you gotta call him like he's the wizard of oz
[03:07:24.120 --> 03:07:26.120]  Behind the curtain. Yeah
[03:07:26.840 --> 03:07:30.060]  Mr. Oz could we get to the question sir? I know there was a few questions
[03:07:31.560 --> 03:07:36.840]  There was one question about the inoculant the amo so that's fishbrew.com people
[03:07:38.040 --> 03:07:40.040]  real easy to remember
[03:07:40.600 --> 03:07:45.400]  The homie brian from yesterday also co-signed that layton. I don't know if you know that gentleman
[03:07:46.120 --> 03:07:51.800]  No, I don't grow her. No, but i've been working with keith for god 15 something years now
[03:07:52.520 --> 03:07:57.800]  He used to laugh at me like like what the fuck are you doing dude, what is wrong with you and i'm like no
[03:07:57.960 --> 03:08:00.520]  No, you don't understand. There's something to this shit
[03:08:02.600 --> 03:08:05.560]  Yeah, yeah exactly and literally shit, okay
[03:08:07.080 --> 03:08:13.000]  And that's where dr. Uh johnson had started with as as layton had said with the the dairy manure
[03:08:13.560 --> 03:08:19.400]  Um and an excess of dairy manure being produced and they were actually putting it into um, big pits
[03:08:19.720 --> 03:08:22.220]  Lagoon and uh, yeah the lagoons
[03:08:22.920 --> 03:08:23.720]  um
[03:08:23.720 --> 03:08:25.400]  And so but now
[03:08:25.400 --> 03:08:29.000]  He actually the last one he actually has a video under his name
[03:08:29.400 --> 03:08:35.560]  Uh on youtube. He doesn't have very many under his own name, but it shows him building a reactor where he just used 100
[03:08:36.200 --> 03:08:37.400]  leaf
[03:08:37.400 --> 03:08:43.960]  Nothing else. No wood chips. No, nothing else. He just um, he set up a a barrel where he loaded the leaves in
[03:08:44.600 --> 03:08:46.280]  uh to soak them
[03:08:46.280 --> 03:08:49.320]  And then he would scoop them out of there throw them in the rear barrel that he had tilted
[03:08:49.480 --> 03:08:53.740]  So most of the water would flow out and they would take that put it into the bioreactor
[03:08:54.200 --> 03:08:58.760]  And the idea is to keep it at around that 70 percent moisture content
[03:08:58.840 --> 03:09:01.960]  And that's why you put in the sprinkler system on top
[03:09:02.520 --> 03:09:09.080]  And give it that minute a day of water to keep it at that 70 percent moisture because that's when all that's that
[03:09:09.560 --> 03:09:13.580]  What do they call it the sweet spot? Yeah is for the biology
[03:09:14.460 --> 03:09:18.240]  The real sweet spot is 85 degrees 70 moisture
[03:09:18.780 --> 03:09:22.860]  If that there you go those parameters you will have an explosive flow
[03:09:23.500 --> 03:09:25.100]  Yeah, yeah
[03:09:25.100 --> 03:09:28.860]  And and he set these things up. Um the one I saw, um
[03:09:30.060 --> 03:09:33.100]  from from uh, uh north america, um
[03:09:33.900 --> 03:09:35.900]  It was in a more northern climate
[03:09:36.060 --> 03:09:41.820]  So they had set it up because if you want this thing to to really uh kick you have to have it
[03:09:42.300 --> 03:09:48.380]  Um, so it doesn't freeze so I unless I put it into a building but they put this into a greenhouse and they didn't build
[03:09:48.460 --> 03:09:54.460]  This small round little bioreactor. It's like 100 feet long by 300 feet long
[03:09:55.100 --> 03:09:57.100]  And they put in underground
[03:09:57.980 --> 03:10:04.380]  Piping so they could keep the air flowing from uh the bottom and they just put thousands of pipes in
[03:10:05.100 --> 03:10:07.100]  all through this this
[03:10:07.240 --> 03:10:10.220]  Material as they loaded it in they just kept putting the pipes in
[03:10:10.940 --> 03:10:12.460]  And I
[03:10:12.460 --> 03:10:16.860]  I watched the presentation he gave there and it was like holy shit, man
[03:10:16.940 --> 03:10:21.820]  This is these are people that are they've got enough material to you know
[03:10:21.980 --> 03:10:25.200]  Do half of north america if they do it as an extract
[03:10:28.610 --> 03:10:30.610]  Yeah, for sure man
[03:10:31.090 --> 03:10:37.090]  That's why I say, you know this community has the tools to change our planet back to where it needs to be
[03:10:37.490 --> 03:10:41.490]  We just don't really understand that we do but we do or you guys do
[03:10:41.810 --> 03:10:46.690]  And I think we know it. I just think that we are not respected by big air
[03:10:47.170 --> 03:10:50.550]  We they have yet to realize that they don't need synthetics
[03:10:51.250 --> 03:10:55.890]  They don't need anything all of the things that they need are present. They just have to
[03:10:56.830 --> 03:10:58.450]  re-establish them
[03:10:58.450 --> 03:11:03.430]  Because they're not I think a lot of that is a form of the education
[03:11:04.930 --> 03:11:09.730]  And or lack thereof or the misdirection of the truth
[03:11:10.610 --> 03:11:17.890]  Is more the the thing is that misdirection of what the truth actually is because I like i'm a country boy
[03:11:17.970 --> 03:11:22.550]  I grew up around farms all my life. Um both the you know agricultural
[03:11:23.410 --> 03:11:24.770]  and animal
[03:11:24.770 --> 03:11:26.530]  and um
[03:11:26.530 --> 03:11:28.210]  there is
[03:11:28.210 --> 03:11:29.710]  so much
[03:11:29.710 --> 03:11:30.930]  misunderstandings
[03:11:30.930 --> 03:11:32.530]  um that
[03:11:32.530 --> 03:11:35.250]  I I just I don't get mad anymore
[03:11:35.970 --> 03:11:37.970]  I just look at it as
[03:11:38.290 --> 03:11:45.670]  You know, these people just haven't reached the point in their life where they can even open their mind to start understanding
[03:11:46.450 --> 03:11:47.250]  and
[03:11:47.250 --> 03:11:50.450]  What i'm trying to do is take them to that point where they can actually
[03:11:51.090 --> 03:11:55.990]  Open their eyes and go that. Oh, there is a different possibility of reality
[03:11:58.610 --> 03:12:00.610]  Yes, and then again it's
[03:12:01.490 --> 03:12:07.650]  A combination of those in control don't want us to have knowledge because then they would lose control
[03:12:08.210 --> 03:12:13.970]  So they just keep what do I call it? The the evolving human species beat him shit
[03:12:15.170 --> 03:12:19.570]  Teach him crap and don't let them explore what's really going on
[03:12:21.010 --> 03:12:23.410]  Yeah control just fucking control
[03:12:24.210 --> 03:12:31.490]  And controlling money. Did we have any questions or we just there was I know they were making meatballs in the chat for a while there
[03:12:33.090 --> 03:12:35.090]  Too many recipes
[03:12:35.410 --> 03:12:39.730]  Did you have enough uh garlic in there, you know
[03:12:43.250 --> 03:12:47.090]  Uh, i'm not seeing any questions it's more a lot of chatter
[03:12:48.050 --> 03:12:50.050]  Yeah, it was it was a good chat today
[03:12:50.130 --> 03:12:56.930]  um, but we'll definitely have to have you back on at some point ken because uh, yes, this conversation could have gone
[03:12:57.730 --> 03:13:03.650]  Uh a lot further today for sure and there were some points that you made that I didn't want to stop the rant
[03:13:03.730 --> 03:13:10.450]  But I would have loved to expand on them because they were really good valid points. And so, you know again
[03:13:11.090 --> 03:13:12.770]  this this is a
[03:13:12.770 --> 03:13:19.010]  Open style free-for-all format. So whatever happens happens, but exactly and it was it was great
[03:13:19.090 --> 03:13:22.290]  I mean, I love I love where your brain goes a lot of the shit
[03:13:22.930 --> 03:13:25.410]  You clearly have had some time in the truck to think
[03:13:26.610 --> 03:13:29.170]  Oh, yes years upon years
[03:13:29.730 --> 03:13:33.570]  You have to consider I didn't start this biological journey
[03:13:34.450 --> 03:13:37.490]  Until I met elaine morrison you arsehole
[03:13:38.210 --> 03:13:43.010]  You know, you've taken me places where I do you have dared to go?
[03:13:43.890 --> 03:13:47.490]  Okay, and I want to thank you from the bottom of my very soul
[03:13:48.450 --> 03:13:49.890]  because
[03:13:49.890 --> 03:13:56.550]  I owe you and peter and brian and every speaker that has come on to this platform a debt of gratitude
[03:13:57.430 --> 03:14:01.670]  For what you have given back to me and my life
[03:14:02.630 --> 03:14:07.430]  And allowing me to share with others the knowledge you are sharing with me
[03:14:07.830 --> 03:14:15.190]  And it's all about caring and sharing and when you think about it, it's the same in the in for our animals for our plants
[03:14:15.910 --> 03:14:17.110]  the rise
[03:14:17.110 --> 03:14:18.710]  the rhizosphere
[03:14:18.710 --> 03:14:19.830]  You know
[03:14:19.830 --> 03:14:25.050]  It's all about the microbiology caring about each other sharing the nutrients
[03:14:26.010 --> 03:14:31.530]  And moving it around and giving it to the plant so the plant can grow and if you want
[03:14:32.250 --> 03:14:35.690]  I i'll come on every week. I don't have a job. I i'm i'm
[03:14:36.390 --> 03:14:38.090]  Disabled they say
[03:14:38.090 --> 03:14:43.130]  You know so I can come on on every show every day if you want. I have nothing better than you
[03:14:43.450 --> 03:14:49.530]  Then you know bullshit with you guys because believe me this is so stimulating in my life
[03:14:50.090 --> 03:14:54.730]  You know i've been looking forward to this i've actually late and i've had your email for over a year
[03:14:55.050 --> 03:14:58.970]  But I wasn't ready to use it until you know three weeks ago
[03:14:58.970 --> 03:15:02.170]  That was before I actually laughed watch the show on the right
[03:15:02.790 --> 03:15:08.090]  Rhizosphere and the last one I can't remember what the title was last week where you guys were basically asking
[03:15:08.570 --> 03:15:11.130]  It or it was like you were asking me
[03:15:11.850 --> 03:15:13.850]  To get my ass
[03:15:13.930 --> 03:15:19.050]  Onto this show to share so if you guys want anytime you want to chop it up or if you want
[03:15:19.370 --> 03:15:21.870]  You know somebody to come on every week with a different perspective
[03:15:22.430 --> 03:15:25.150]  You know i'd love to do it
[03:15:27.150 --> 03:15:33.310]  Keep that in mind for sure brother, my wife just said you got to be careful because you'll never get a word in edgewise though
[03:15:35.470 --> 03:15:38.830]  And if anybody anybody wants to chop it up
[03:15:39.230 --> 03:15:44.910]  Um hit peter up hit uh, brian up. Uh, layton actually has my my uh, my digits
[03:15:45.470 --> 03:15:48.670]  Um ask for my digits. Give me a call
[03:15:49.150 --> 03:15:54.830]  Um, i'll actually have free north america on my cell phone supposedly tomorrow. Um
[03:15:55.790 --> 03:16:02.430]  So if if you don't have a long distance plan you are in north america, you know, i'll call you back just shoot me a text
[03:16:02.830 --> 03:16:08.270]  Um, i'll i'll talk about this shit day night weekends. It don't fucking matter to me
[03:16:08.590 --> 03:16:15.230]  I love this shit and I love sharing and giving back. There you go. I'm into that and thank you everybody
[03:16:15.870 --> 03:16:17.150]  um
[03:16:17.230 --> 03:16:20.830]  I love you all and you're my type of people and uh
[03:16:21.550 --> 03:16:26.750]  Thank you. Yeah, let's go make a difference in quorum songs, right? You damn right
[03:16:27.710 --> 03:16:31.710]  Let's us be the quorum and actually we are the brain trust with you know
[03:16:31.710 --> 03:16:37.070]  You guys and me and leaf and craig and and everybody else in this community that's ever come up
[03:16:37.470 --> 03:16:41.630]  We are the brain trust. We are the quorum and and we're giving that
[03:16:42.430 --> 03:16:48.030]  Back to the community and peter, you know, was there anything that I I said
[03:16:49.070 --> 03:16:54.190]  Because I know you that there's a lot of stuff. You don't you listen to and you don't necessarily agree with
[03:16:54.910 --> 03:16:57.870]  Okay, I would love one peter question
[03:16:58.910 --> 03:17:04.190]  On on something that he doesn't agree with because how am I going to learn if everybody agrees with me?
[03:17:04.590 --> 03:17:09.310]  And doesn't stretch this old brain to think in new ways, you know, how am I going to learn?
[03:17:09.310 --> 03:17:11.550]  So peter you got one question, please
[03:17:12.110 --> 03:17:17.870]  I I must like I feel like what i've been super high this whole uh show
[03:17:20.030 --> 03:17:22.030]  I've been uh
[03:17:22.670 --> 03:17:28.110]  I've been packing seeds up. Uh, I was outside for a little bit
[03:17:28.750 --> 03:17:32.190]  Uh, I cleaned my pipe. I smoked my pipe
[03:17:32.830 --> 03:17:34.830]  um
[03:17:35.150 --> 03:17:42.190]  I I think st. Bernard's observation booth needs to come on and and I do I think he disagrees with
[03:17:42.830 --> 03:17:50.270]  I I I was joking that here. Let me actually I have a visual. Uh for what s bob, uh
[03:17:52.270 --> 03:17:55.710]  My vision of what hold on, where are you?
[03:17:56.990 --> 03:17:59.470]  Yeah, he definitely needs to come on the show for sure
[03:18:00.190 --> 03:18:05.490]  My vision of him listening to this entire conversation was this
[03:18:11.950 --> 03:18:14.830]  And so I would love to get s bobs, uh
[03:18:16.350 --> 03:18:22.110]  I think one of the things he just well, uh, the definition of where the rhizosphere ends
[03:18:22.350 --> 03:18:26.910]  Uh, I remember that one and then uh, whether different types of music, uh
[03:18:27.870 --> 03:18:29.230]  have uh
[03:18:29.230 --> 03:18:30.750]  different effects
[03:18:30.750 --> 03:18:34.430]  You know, there's been so many studies both for and against that
[03:18:34.990 --> 03:18:37.310]  and it's kind of it's kind of similar to like
[03:18:38.430 --> 03:18:40.430]  um a challenge to energy
[03:18:40.910 --> 03:18:41.950]  because
[03:18:41.950 --> 03:18:46.510]  All forms of energy are waves. So whether it's a vibration or light
[03:18:47.070 --> 03:18:50.670]  They're all there. You can reduce them all down to a simple wave
[03:18:51.150 --> 03:18:53.950]  So to say that music could have no effect
[03:18:54.670 --> 03:18:56.670]  I think is um again
[03:18:56.970 --> 03:18:58.970]  Short-sighted maybe a little bit arrogant
[03:18:59.710 --> 03:19:04.270]  I'm, not positive that you know, we've actually found the right frequencies
[03:19:04.430 --> 03:19:07.790]  Although I did send you a clip of a hemp plant
[03:19:08.430 --> 03:19:10.430]  Growing do you remember that peter?
[03:19:11.630 --> 03:19:12.750]  What?
[03:19:12.750 --> 03:19:15.230]  Like recently or like a year ago?
[03:19:15.710 --> 03:19:20.430]  This was a while back, but this was this was fucking amazing. So this group
[03:19:21.230 --> 03:19:23.230]  had figured out how to
[03:19:24.110 --> 03:19:29.950]  Listen to a plant grow and i'm gonna i'm gonna oh, yeah. Yeah that music clip. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[03:19:30.670 --> 03:19:33.330]  That was probably one of the most fascinating
[03:19:34.670 --> 03:19:35.710]  um
[03:19:35.710 --> 03:19:39.310]  pieces of information or data that i've ever come across
[03:19:40.110 --> 03:19:41.790]  and
[03:19:41.790 --> 03:19:44.270]  Yeah, the fact that they actually recorded it
[03:19:44.990 --> 03:19:46.670]  could indicate
[03:19:46.670 --> 03:19:54.830]  That there would be ways to use that information to help that plant or push that plant along
[03:19:55.390 --> 03:19:56.430]  um
[03:19:56.430 --> 03:19:59.310]  in in times of perhaps stress or need but
[03:20:00.030 --> 03:20:04.670]  Um, we'll have to play that again at some point in the future because it was really cool
[03:20:05.150 --> 03:20:08.030]  it's like when you talked about that the plant that was
[03:20:08.990 --> 03:20:12.130]  Really really extra deep green and more vibrant
[03:20:13.090 --> 03:20:18.930]  If you go to that plant and sit down on uh against it and do your meditation there
[03:20:19.330 --> 03:20:23.570]  Will that take you to a higher level because there's so much positive energy right there
[03:20:24.850 --> 03:20:31.890]  No, I think it probably would but I don't know agree with you. I would agree with you that everything is releasing some form of energy
[03:20:32.210 --> 03:20:33.890]  um, whether it's
[03:20:33.890 --> 03:20:40.050]  But I shouldn't say release some of them are taking and some of them are doing so yeah to sit by a sick
[03:20:41.010 --> 03:20:43.010]  Dying tree or bush
[03:20:43.170 --> 03:20:49.830]  Probably wouldn't be beneficial. Uh transference anyone perhaps even detrimental to you, uh transference
[03:20:50.690 --> 03:20:52.850]  Yep, transference. I mean we talked about that
[03:20:53.650 --> 03:20:56.370]  With pauline and cancer she believed that she
[03:20:56.930 --> 03:21:03.010]  Because she was working with cancer patients and wasn't listening to what she studied in the shaman work. She did
[03:21:03.410 --> 03:21:05.490]  She wasn't really protecting herself
[03:21:05.890 --> 03:21:10.050]  But she actually took that on and she she accepted 20 as her own
[03:21:10.530 --> 03:21:16.370]  80 of what it was she took it on and and if you look at look at the woman and her
[03:21:17.250 --> 03:21:19.250]  history as as a human
[03:21:19.810 --> 03:21:21.170]  she spent
[03:21:21.170 --> 03:21:23.890]  30 years deep diving down all of these
[03:21:25.230 --> 03:21:27.230]  alternative medical
[03:21:27.630 --> 03:21:29.630]  spiritual
[03:21:30.670 --> 03:21:32.050]  Disciplines
[03:21:32.050 --> 03:21:38.850]  And she did yoga at least once a day and many times taught multiple classes a day only ate organic food
[03:21:39.730 --> 03:21:41.730]  nothing in excess
[03:21:41.810 --> 03:21:43.570]  super healthy
[03:21:43.570 --> 03:21:47.490]  Super spiritually uplifting and yet she got stage four ovarian cancer
[03:21:48.610 --> 03:21:50.610]  How does that fucking happen man? So
[03:21:51.250 --> 03:21:53.250]  Transference is real and I oh, yeah
[03:21:53.570 --> 03:21:57.810]  Yeah, want to warn people if you if you don't believe in it be careful
[03:21:57.810 --> 03:22:03.330]  It might come back and bite you in the ass. Well, you look at the the show that pauline did with the uh, the masseuse
[03:22:03.810 --> 03:22:04.690]  um
[03:22:04.690 --> 03:22:06.690]  Three girls that was oh
[03:22:07.010 --> 03:22:12.290]  I've been trying to get my wife to watch that damn thing and and she just she's always on on other stuff
[03:22:12.370 --> 03:22:16.290]  but that's where I met pauline the first time or saw pauline I should say
[03:22:16.850 --> 03:22:17.650]  but
[03:22:17.650 --> 03:22:24.550]  When she's doing that masseuse she's had to actually change the program of her teaching to include the backlash
[03:22:24.950 --> 03:22:28.310]  That can happen to the masseuse when they release the tension
[03:22:29.110 --> 03:22:36.950]  And the energy in that injury or muscle that's that's damaged. It's there. It's real we can see it, you know, but
[03:22:37.750 --> 03:22:41.530]  Anyway guys, I know you guys I mean, you know peter's there eating. He's got the munchies
[03:22:42.150 --> 03:22:43.190]  You know
[03:22:43.190 --> 03:22:48.310]  So we've gone three hours 22 minutes. So maybe it's time to wrap this one up for this week
[03:22:48.870 --> 03:22:54.230]  Oh, yeah, I I would actually love to just keep going but uh, you know, I had breakfast so, you know
[03:22:54.390 --> 03:22:57.510]  I'm a step ahead of you guys that that uh, yeah, by the way
[03:22:57.510 --> 03:23:03.830]  That was a cupcake that evidently my three-year-old made for me. I don't know if she just came back from school. I don't know if she
[03:23:04.710 --> 03:23:10.790]  Anyway, the look on her face when you ate that beer was priceless. Yeah, that was the first thing i've eaten all day
[03:23:10.870 --> 03:23:14.550]  So oh and my wife says that uh, jenna is absolutely beautiful
[03:23:15.110 --> 03:23:17.110]  or she is
[03:23:20.150 --> 03:23:22.390]  M-g-e-m my brother's daughter, uh
[03:23:22.950 --> 03:23:29.350]  Uh youngest daughter is jemma as well. Yeah, I know I I fear her, uh her teenage years
[03:23:30.790 --> 03:23:35.110]  Every man that has a daughter better feared the teenage years
[03:23:36.310 --> 03:23:40.490]  And it's not fearing for her. It's fearing for am I gonna have to kill that motherfucker?
[03:23:44.390 --> 03:23:50.790]  So anyway guys, yeah anytime I I would I would dearly love to to come on to every single show
[03:23:51.350 --> 03:23:58.790]  And and you know add to stuff like um, you were talking about uh, um biochar about the johnson sue
[03:23:59.350 --> 03:24:01.030]  uh bioreactor
[03:24:01.030 --> 03:24:04.970]  I've taken deep dives down there and I could really add a lot to the conversation
[03:24:05.830 --> 03:24:06.790]  um
[03:24:06.790 --> 03:24:12.390]  But that's that's of course up to you guys in the community because i'm not gonna force myself down anybody because that's not who I am
[03:24:13.510 --> 03:24:16.150]  well, we appreciate your level of of
[03:24:17.570 --> 03:24:19.570]  research or wormholing
[03:24:21.590 --> 03:24:28.150]  Oh, yeah, because I jumped in the rabbit hole man and it didn't end it was these damn wormholes that caught me and drugged me down
[03:24:30.470 --> 03:24:33.510]  And there's even smaller wormholes called nematode holes dude
[03:24:35.990 --> 03:24:39.930]  I've traveled down them super highways, man. I'm a truck driver. It's natural
[03:24:42.150 --> 03:24:44.150]  Nice nice
[03:24:45.830 --> 03:24:48.170]  You guys got any uh housekeeping
[03:24:48.890 --> 03:24:53.850]  Uh, not I'm not doing much this couple weeks i'm still chilling dude
[03:24:54.490 --> 03:24:59.130]  But i'll try we hope to have an debate debate started next week. Layton. So
[03:24:59.610 --> 03:25:03.870]  I'm behind the scenes. We'll see if that can work out. I haven't got a confirmation
[03:25:04.410 --> 03:25:08.730]  Um, and then next week I promise, uh, you're gonna want to watch wednesday's show
[03:25:09.370 --> 03:25:13.690]  Uh, I hope that it'll be something to be uh, remembered. What are you doing?
[03:25:14.650 --> 03:25:18.490]  We're talking with some guests we're not gonna release it yet, but I think uh friday
[03:25:18.890 --> 03:25:23.610]  We'll make a flyer, but I promise you guys it'll be something that you probably want to just listen to
[03:25:24.570 --> 03:25:26.570]  individuals that um
[03:25:27.610 --> 03:25:31.290]  I think that that should speak for the community. I'll just leave it like that
[03:25:31.850 --> 03:25:34.250]  Nice two individuals. I feel like definitely should
[03:25:34.890 --> 03:25:38.250]  uh voice somehow their their views because
[03:25:40.170 --> 03:25:43.210]  I think their views line up with the way that the community should be
[03:25:44.090 --> 03:25:45.590]  um
[03:25:45.590 --> 03:25:47.530]  respected and run
[03:25:47.530 --> 03:25:50.410]  Hope that makes sense. Nice respect is huge
[03:25:51.130 --> 03:25:52.890]  huge
[03:25:52.890 --> 03:25:56.590]  So st. Bernard's observation booth put that one in your calendar
[03:25:59.050 --> 03:26:02.970]  Well, does he wanna uh, does he want to debate i'm sure I see him
[03:26:05.610 --> 03:26:12.090]  Yeah, he's here I know I have asked if you if you're down to come on, uh email me
[03:26:13.930 --> 03:26:15.770]  Yeah
[03:26:15.770 --> 03:26:21.790]  We're not fighting. This isn't this isn't about trying to shit on each other. It's about having an open conversation
[03:26:22.330 --> 03:26:24.330]  about things that we perhaps
[03:26:24.330 --> 03:26:29.770]  Don't completely align or agree on and it needs to be subject matter that you know, you two are
[03:26:30.410 --> 03:26:36.410]  Know a lot about like I guess some people are afraid to talk about things that they don't necessarily know a ton about so
[03:26:37.690 --> 03:26:42.090]  You might go in a direction where they wouldn't be able to and other people don't have that fear at all
[03:26:42.970 --> 03:26:49.130]  Yeah, exactly exactly so other people are fearless talking about things they don't know much about
[03:26:54.810 --> 03:27:00.810]  I don't know what all right. I will uh, email me
[03:27:02.010 --> 03:27:06.250]  And uh, where are you from st. Bernard? What what what time zone?
[03:27:08.170 --> 03:27:10.170]  I believe mountain
[03:27:12.410 --> 03:27:18.250]  Okay, so so he is saying that debates have a specific format which uh, i'm happy to to
[03:27:19.210 --> 03:27:23.610]  Yeah, you have a time frame debate format and to lay it out. Um
[03:27:24.410 --> 03:27:26.490]  And who's the moderator brian or you?
[03:27:27.690 --> 03:27:34.090]  Well, i think we'll figure that out soon. We'll fit. Well, yeah, we'll we'll fit we're we're we're doing this we're winging it on the fly
[03:27:34.250 --> 03:27:36.250]  but uh
[03:27:36.330 --> 03:27:41.370]  Anyway, we got our our link in doug. Actually we did one at um cooper
[03:27:41.610 --> 03:27:43.450]  This was years ago
[03:27:43.450 --> 03:27:44.570]  um
[03:27:44.570 --> 03:27:47.690]  We did a lincoln douglas style debate. We had this woman from
[03:27:48.710 --> 03:27:51.070]  princeton as the uh moderator
[03:27:51.850 --> 03:27:53.690]  uh
[03:27:53.690 --> 03:27:59.290]  It's a d is that memory is deep in my the back of my brain so I gotta remember the uh,
[03:28:00.090 --> 03:28:05.210]  Before we cut I'd like to ask layton one quick question. Sure. So
[03:28:05.930 --> 03:28:07.930]  Who do you think is in control of?
[03:28:08.490 --> 03:28:10.490]  the plant or the biology
[03:28:10.570 --> 03:28:12.250]  like
[03:28:12.250 --> 03:28:13.370]  uh
[03:28:13.370 --> 03:28:14.950]  Who is?
[03:28:14.950 --> 03:28:16.410]  control
[03:28:16.410 --> 03:28:22.510]  Well, you know, that's a that's a deep question because that was the whole point of this discussion
[03:28:23.130 --> 03:28:25.450]  you you have to understand that
[03:28:26.250 --> 03:28:28.250]  the plant
[03:28:29.530 --> 03:28:31.530]  Has to take things in
[03:28:32.890 --> 03:28:34.890]  To be able to
[03:28:34.970 --> 03:28:40.250]  Control so who's in control? I'd say the fucking universe dude. Nobody's
[03:28:41.350 --> 03:28:46.090]  Perfect. Nobody's goes far beyond all of it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[03:28:47.450 --> 03:28:54.650]  Control stay on until you guys drop off control is a fallacy and it's exactly nobody's actually in control. No
[03:28:55.290 --> 03:28:57.290]  Yeah
[03:28:58.250 --> 03:29:01.610]  All right, I I i'm looking up debate formats but uh, anyway
[03:29:02.330 --> 03:29:05.850]  S s bob will uh will lay out the
[03:29:07.050 --> 03:29:09.210]  the format but uh, so
