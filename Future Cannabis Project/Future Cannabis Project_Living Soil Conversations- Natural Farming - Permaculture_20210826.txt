[00:00.700 --> 00:07.840]  So I was hoping it would be a shirts off party given that Brian and Marco are
[00:07.840 --> 00:13.480]  almost poolside in Vegas and Joey's kind of like half in half out of the shirt
[00:13.480 --> 00:20.260]  and Leighton is sadly for everybody for all the ladies watching wearing a shirt
[00:20.260 --> 00:26.060]  today but Joey you are hitting the talk show circuit this week thanks for
[00:26.060 --> 00:32.220]  joining us and I'm gonna throw it over to Brian yeah good morning Living Soil
[00:32.220 --> 00:37.500]  Nerds we are coming to you live from Vegas we're excited we got Marco in my
[00:37.500 --> 00:42.100]  hotel room as well as KNF Gardens to kind of have a group discussion with
[00:42.100 --> 00:46.780]  Joey Joey is a legend Joey is somebody that I feel like a lot of us look up to
[00:46.780 --> 00:53.040]  he continues to educate you know with gratitude and you know giving back to
[00:53.040 --> 00:55.820]  the community and that's something that I feel like Leighton and I are really
[00:55.820 --> 01:00.440]  big on and trying to promote the people that for many many years now are going
[01:00.440 --> 01:04.440]  out of their way to educate going out of their way to educate especially if you
[01:04.440 --> 01:09.400]  want to do like on-site things where I feel like it is a fair price I do see
[01:09.400 --> 01:12.500]  some people out there starting to charge more and more and that's one of the
[01:12.500 --> 01:15.600]  reasons why I reached out to Marco it's one of the reasons I reached out to KNF
[01:15.600 --> 01:20.320]  because those boys as well as myself Leighton Peter Joey we're big on just
[01:20.320 --> 01:24.380]  trying to give you guys information and make sure that information is quality
[01:24.380 --> 01:29.220]  information and I wanted to give some quick shout outs or I've been in Vegas
[01:29.220 --> 01:34.740]  for a few days now shout out to Steve Cantwell of Green Life Productions I was
[01:34.740 --> 01:39.140]  hanging out with him yesterday also shout out to Red Dirt Raised James and
[01:39.140 --> 01:43.820]  his wife we got to go and check out his facility see things firsthand ask
[01:43.820 --> 01:48.900]  questions see what it really takes to do indoor farming at that level at at scale
[01:48.900 --> 01:53.900]  and and basically be growing unbelievable plants in the middle of the
[01:53.900 --> 01:58.020]  desert so shout out to Steve Cantwell I'm even wearing a shirt today that guy
[01:58.020 --> 02:03.860]  is an unbelievable human being you know even took took my fam you know my wife
[02:03.860 --> 02:08.740]  and James and his wife to lunch and stuff like that so I cannot speak highly
[02:08.740 --> 02:13.500]  enough for that guy I hope that a lot of you start to realize that there are
[02:13.500 --> 02:17.860]  people shout out to Josh Steensland as well that is going out of their way to
[02:17.860 --> 02:21.620]  cultivate cannabis in this manner and do it in a successful way we're just
[02:21.620 --> 02:26.540]  probably five six maybe seven years ago it seemed like a pipe dream so I just
[02:26.540 --> 02:29.780]  wanted to give him a quick shout out I had never seen his facility firsthand
[02:29.780 --> 02:34.740]  obviously he's a huge fan of the show and we've had him on a couple times I
[02:34.740 --> 02:38.740]  know Peters had him on before Layton and I were even involved so a quick shout
[02:38.740 --> 02:42.140]  out Joey I didn't want to take any of your thunder today buddy but yesterday
[02:42.140 --> 02:45.860]  was amazing and I do feel like you know there's a reason why he's got the
[02:45.860 --> 02:51.100]  trifecta he's damn pure which Joey is as well he's got the clean green
[02:51.100 --> 02:56.220]  certified and then the be kind certified as well as far as I understand
[02:56.220 --> 02:59.500]  one of the few companies commercial companies going out of their way to try
[02:59.500 --> 03:02.780]  to get those things that separate themselves and show that they're growing
[03:02.780 --> 03:08.020]  medicine over anything else shout out to my co-host Layton Morrison appreciate
[03:08.020 --> 03:12.460]  you buddy each and every week with me shout out to Peter this channel has
[03:12.460 --> 03:18.340]  really been growing it's gone from about 32,000 and he Peter just hit 60,000
[03:18.340 --> 03:22.540]  subscribers I believe it was like yesterday or the day before so shout
[03:22.540 --> 03:26.340]  out to you Peter I feel like hitting that that mark and then the goal from
[03:26.340 --> 03:29.700]  what I understand on YouTube is we got to get you to a hundred thousand then
[03:29.700 --> 03:33.820]  you get a little fancy plaque from YouTube so you can get your little fancy
[03:33.820 --> 03:39.180]  plaque and have an Emmy and be up there as a big dog I've been hoping to stay

[03:47.740 --> 03:51.540]  of want to get into it I got KNF standing by as well so that we can

[05:44.620 --> 05:48.660]  me years to digest it all I told Peter the other day my computer usually has
[05:48.660 --> 05:53.940]  about 10 tabs open with future cannabis project shows I'm trying to get to and
[05:53.940 --> 05:59.180]  I'm slowly knocking them off and yeah Layton you're one of my we're one of my
[05:59.180 --> 06:02.900]  living soil gurus man I have so much love and respect for you and I hang on
[06:02.900 --> 06:06.740]  every word you say man so it's such a pleasure to be here talking with you and
[06:06.740 --> 06:12.900]  spend time with you and and yeah brother Marco man you you have been a huge

[06:16.340 --> 06:20.860]  still hear all these nice things I'm about to say about you but um you know
[06:20.860 --> 06:25.140]  just to find someone who is practicing all these natural farming practices
[06:25.140 --> 06:29.620]  doing such a good job putting all this educational info out there not being
[06:29.620 --> 06:33.540]  focused on ganja I know you're now starting to reveal that side of yourself
[06:33.540 --> 06:37.980]  which is so beautiful people get to see and experience but just seeing the way
[06:37.980 --> 06:41.660]  you take the traditional natural farming those principles and you adapt it to
[06:41.660 --> 06:45.300]  your environment and really use your resources you have available out there
[06:45.300 --> 06:50.420]  in your area just been super inspiring and pleasure to get to know you guys
[06:50.420 --> 06:56.180]  yeah Brian Marco let's absolutely try to make some stuff happen so just honored
[06:56.180 --> 06:59.700]  to be here with you guys and any chance I can get to talk about natural farming
[06:59.700 --> 07:08.290]  permaculture with non-juror folks I'm happy so thanks again yeah blessings
[07:09.170 --> 07:14.170]  yeah so yeah I've been making the circuit a little bit lately we're
[07:14.170 --> 07:17.250]  starting to run some workshops out here I've been living at Heartwood Mountain
[07:17.250 --> 07:23.050]  Sanctuary for the last year and a half been pretty shut down during kovat I got
[07:23.050 --> 07:26.170]  hired up here to build a bunch of curriculum build an eight-month
[07:26.210 --> 07:30.730]  residential program that we would have been running this year students would
[07:30.730 --> 07:33.890]  have came in March and stayed the whole season with me through November and
[07:33.890 --> 07:38.450]  unfortunately that didn't happen and now this property is coming up for sale so
[07:38.450 --> 07:43.050]  it doesn't look like that's gonna happen here in the meantime we ran a bunch of
[07:43.050 --> 07:47.770]  programs this summer some free workshops and paid workshops and at the end of
[07:47.770 --> 07:51.810]  last month we ran what we call the regen boot camp I ran with my good friend D
[07:51.810 --> 07:56.250]  Damon Diaz another drag player of medicine certified educator and farmer
[07:56.250 --> 08:01.410]  incredible teacher used to work on my my old farm the Mendo hideout farm I used
[08:01.410 --> 08:07.970]  to run out in on Bell Springs Mendocino a few years back and yeah just trying to
[08:07.970 --> 08:13.130]  pack as much of this natural farming in a one-day workshop it's not just KNF
[08:13.130 --> 08:18.090]  it's not just a dom you know I come from permaculture background we need all the
[08:18.090 --> 08:23.890]  tools in our toolbox we need all the resources of natural farming really fits
[08:23.890 --> 08:28.730]  into that permaculture framework of you know using your available resources
[08:28.730 --> 08:33.250]  creating no waste you know mimicking these processes we see in nature and
[08:33.250 --> 08:38.790]  patterns you see in nature so yeah we've put together a really unique one-day
[08:38.790 --> 08:44.530]  intensive where these are the techniques I use in my cannabis cultivation a mix
[08:44.530 --> 08:49.250]  of to God a mix of KNF a mix of living soil it really all starts with building
[08:49.250 --> 08:53.090]  that biology in the soil as Layton's always hammered home that's the most
[08:53.090 --> 08:59.010]  important thing was feeding that environment under the soil so yeah that's
[08:59.010 --> 09:03.730]  been a lot of fun we're taking the camp on the road we're teaching the next one
[09:03.730 --> 09:07.890]  this weekend down in Middletown at my girlfriend Tamara's farm heal thyself
[09:07.890 --> 09:11.570]  gardens she's gonna be teaching alongside me she's an incredible Dem
[09:11.770 --> 09:16.570]  pure educator she's the only down certified farmer in Lake County has a
[09:16.570 --> 09:19.530]  beautiful farm that she's been developing for about seven eight years
[09:19.530 --> 09:24.370]  now it's in a lot of transition she's got her own personal grow there right
[09:24.370 --> 09:29.370]  now but she's uh we've installed about a 10,000 square foot Google garden this
[09:29.370 --> 09:33.610]  last winter we got very little rain so she decided to let it sit for the year
[09:33.610 --> 09:38.250]  and then next year she could have be applying for her cultivation license and
[09:38.250 --> 09:42.370]  growing that quarter acre in the meantime she's got a small personal use
[09:42.370 --> 09:47.650]  garden there so yeah we're doing that this Saturday the 28th and then
[09:47.650 --> 09:51.170]  September 11th we're taking the show on the road up to Eugene and gonna be at
[09:51.170 --> 09:56.970]  Torch River farm outside of Eugene Torch River is an awesome farm they're in a big
[09:56.970 --> 10:04.290]  transition themselves they're licensed Oregon cultivator producer they're doing
[10:04.290 --> 10:08.330]  a lot of a lot of transition they built a big Google garden this last winter
[10:08.330 --> 10:11.170]  that they're also letting sit for the year that they'll be planting in next
[10:11.170 --> 10:15.610]  spring they're adopting a lot of KNF and Jadon practices and they're doing a
[10:15.610 --> 10:19.090]  great job putting out educational content and documenting it if you go to
[10:19.090 --> 10:24.130]  their excuse me Instagram Torch River farm you'll see they've done a really
[10:24.130 --> 10:29.890]  great job showing how simple a lot of these inputs are to create and that's
[10:29.890 --> 10:33.330]  really what I love about natural farming these practices we teach us they're so
[10:33.330 --> 10:37.930]  simple they're so accessible anybody can do this you know and master Cho is
[10:37.930 --> 10:41.730]  coming up with Korean natural farming his goal was to really give the power
[10:41.730 --> 10:45.890]  back to the farmer you know the power been taken away by the agriculture
[10:45.890 --> 10:50.170]  companies by big AG by big chemicals telling us you know you're not capable
[10:50.170 --> 10:55.890]  of doing this growing your own crops growing on food you know growing plants
[10:55.890 --> 11:02.290]  and you know our ancestors farmed like it's very simply for eons using compost
[11:02.290 --> 11:07.810]  and manures and plant waste so I love teaching this stuff because it's so
[11:07.810 --> 11:10.970]  accessible it doesn't take a lot of equipment you know you could literally
[11:10.970 --> 11:15.570]  be practicing this in third world countries with little to no resources
[11:15.570 --> 11:19.610]  really just the microbes you have in your forest and plants you have
[11:19.610 --> 11:24.090]  available to you so it's been really empowering to share that with farmers
[11:24.090 --> 11:28.650]  you know right now your humble County things are just being decimated this
[11:28.650 --> 11:32.810]  industry is on the ropes right now mom-and-pop farmer are struggling prices
[11:32.810 --> 11:36.250]  are in the toilet right now we're seeing a major crash at the market it's gonna
[11:36.250 --> 11:41.610]  be a big flushing out this next year to farmers and and so if you're still
[11:41.610 --> 11:45.450]  farming the way the growth store taught you and every time you have a problem
[11:45.450 --> 11:48.050]  you're rushing to the growth store to buy the next bottle that they want to
[11:48.050 --> 11:52.210]  sell you those are all your profits you know there's not a lot of profit left in
[11:52.210 --> 11:57.090]  cannabis and so the sooner we can embrace these practices the sooner we
[11:57.090 --> 12:00.770]  can learn to build our own biology in our soil and learn to make our own
[12:00.770 --> 12:04.610]  fertilizers learn to you know handle pests through our own homemade
[12:04.610 --> 12:07.930]  pesticides or through companion plantings and creating these diverse
[12:07.930 --> 12:13.570]  habitats it's more money going in the farmers pocket you know something I
[12:13.570 --> 12:18.050]  really like to hammer home in my consulting and in my teaching is you
[12:18.050 --> 12:21.570]  know there's two ways for your operation to make more money expand which takes
[12:21.570 --> 12:27.250]  all these all these resources or or cut those expenses which usually just takes
[12:27.250 --> 12:30.850]  a little bit of thought a little bit of effort but it's the same dollar going
[12:30.850 --> 12:35.370]  in here in your operations pocket either way so it's a lot easier for a farmer
[12:35.370 --> 12:41.690]  out here to cut down those expenses streamline everything and make a
[12:41.690 --> 12:44.650]  profitable operation because these next two years are going to be rough people
[12:44.650 --> 12:47.450]  here are really just hoping they can hold on to the legalization comes
[12:47.450 --> 12:51.530]  through and these federal legalization of these interstate commerce markets
[12:51.530 --> 12:55.770]  open up and we can finally get this product on some shelves over in Tokyo
[12:55.770 --> 13:00.330]  that's when that's when these small craft farmers I think are really going
[13:00.330 --> 13:06.330]  to be appreciated you know unfortunately we just we still have consumers that
[13:06.330 --> 13:10.730]  need to be educated and that's a long road you know when your average consumer
[13:10.730 --> 13:15.410]  is walking in a dispensary and the only questions they ask are you know is it
[13:15.410 --> 13:20.450]  high THC give me the highest THC stuff you have or is it in decor sativa and
[13:20.450 --> 13:26.370]  all they know is indica make you sleepy sativa make you bouncy I mean these you
[13:26.370 --> 13:30.050]  know what I've vended at events back in the day this is what your average
[13:30.050 --> 13:33.130]  consumer would ask when they come up to the booth you have something you know
[13:33.130 --> 13:37.010]  what's your highest THC and I like a heavy indica because I like to sleep or
[13:37.010 --> 13:43.730]  I like a heavy sativa because I I got shit to do so you know it's not like
[13:43.730 --> 13:47.690]  with wine where we have this sophisticated consumer you have people
[13:47.690 --> 13:52.450]  who are you know your sommeliers your wine aficionados they really know the
[13:52.450 --> 13:58.890]  region they know the grape they know the history and we're starting to see in
[13:58.890 --> 14:04.410]  wine you know the no sulfites movement the natural wine movement we're gonna
[14:04.410 --> 14:08.130]  start to see more natural farming practices be embraced in the wine
[14:08.130 --> 14:14.170]  industry Mimi Castile up in Oregon is an incredible grape grower and winemaker
[14:14.290 --> 14:18.090]  she's winning all these awards she's practicing all these natural practices
[14:18.090 --> 14:22.570]  and kind of turning a wide world on its ear right now so it's amazing it's
[14:22.570 --> 14:27.010]  awesome to see all these established industries and to see how easily they
[14:27.010 --> 14:31.090]  could be turned on their ear and revolutionized with the by the adopting
[14:31.090 --> 14:35.490]  of these natural farm practices so we're so fortunate we get to you know
[14:35.490 --> 14:39.690]  practices some cannabis and play with this cannabis but Jadong Korean natural
[14:39.690 --> 14:45.290]  farming these things were really made to transform our industrial food system
[14:45.290 --> 14:49.970]  you know Jadong the evolution of Korean natural farming was really made by
[14:49.970 --> 14:55.410]  young Sang Cho master Cho's son so that natural farming could be done on a large
[14:55.410 --> 14:59.490]  scale so the big act could do it so that you could produce inputs that could you
[14:59.490 --> 15:05.650]  know fertilize thousands of acres and they've done it it is possible we just
[15:05.650 --> 15:09.570]  have to get that info out there we need we need we need more people educating
[15:09.570 --> 15:16.410]  each other and talking about this and showing that it works and yeah so that's
[15:16.410 --> 15:23.330]  kind of the latest for me what I'm working on these days yeah and you're
[15:23.330 --> 15:28.450]  getting into you know just like you were saying like you're teaching people and
[15:28.450 --> 15:31.250]  that was the main thing we've always used that that phrase pennies on the
[15:31.250 --> 15:35.530]  dollar I feel like that's the same thing with Marco the same thing with K&F over
[15:35.530 --> 15:41.090]  here is that you guys are educating you know I never have any issue paying for
[15:41.090 --> 15:45.770]  someone's time as long as it feels fair and it's also like if I know that that
[15:45.770 --> 15:49.330]  person spent X amount of dollars to learn that information themselves and
[15:49.330 --> 15:55.130]  now they've marked it 3x 4x I look down upon that as well you know I mean how
[15:55.130 --> 15:59.450]  are you gonna learn information and then take it not really add anything to it
[15:59.450 --> 16:03.290]  and then charge more so that's something that I feel like you know I'm just
[16:03.290 --> 16:07.210]  excited that we're gonna be able to you know pick your brain today Joey and and
[16:07.210 --> 16:12.970]  have Marco and all of us here just to be able to have a fantastic discussion and
[16:12.970 --> 16:17.050]  I know Layton I believe you boys were involved with the region stuff
[16:17.050 --> 16:22.770]  beforehand if I'm you know correct me if I'm misspeaking so I think you guys know
[16:22.770 --> 16:27.370]  more of each other than I do but I will say that I'm a huge fan of yours Joey I
[16:27.730 --> 16:33.330]  think that you are somebody that exemplifies what it really takes to be a
[16:33.330 --> 16:39.970]  fantastic farmer and to be a fantastic cannabis farmer I just you know I hope
[16:39.970 --> 16:43.650]  that if you're new to Joey or the Humboldt local check him out on
[16:43.650 --> 16:48.490]  Instagram you'll see why a lot of us consider him an OG and somebody to look
[16:48.490 --> 16:52.890]  up to so Marco let's kind of like throw you in here as well Layton let's get you
[16:53.050 --> 16:57.490]  you know into the chat let's kind of talk more about those you know what it
[16:57.490 --> 17:01.490]  what it really takes to read do region and go past just K&F because I feel like
[17:01.490 --> 17:05.730]  that's sometimes people kind of pigeonhole that Marco and I kind of
[17:05.730 --> 17:09.490]  behind the scenes Joey we're talking we love when you had mentioned like you
[17:09.490 --> 17:12.930]  know you love to use all aspects of it you know if you're out there and you
[17:12.930 --> 17:18.890]  have a you know a variety of tools why not pick and choose why not experiment
[17:18.890 --> 17:23.170]  sometimes you know going out of your way to try to find new things so Marco
[17:23.170 --> 17:26.850]  I'll throw it to you Layton let's kind of get into some of those practices as
[17:26.850 --> 17:32.610]  well all right yeah I got I got one for you um I was talking to someone the
[17:32.610 --> 17:39.290]  other day and they are looking for land and they want to practice permaculture
[17:39.290 --> 17:44.330]  and you know natural farming techniques on this land and they were asking me
[17:44.330 --> 17:49.850]  what kind of things to look for even before you were to purchase the land so
[17:49.850 --> 17:54.490]  kind of like a do you have a checklist I know obviously you want sort of access
[17:54.490 --> 17:59.330]  to water certain things and I know a few of them but why don't you uh you know
[17:59.330 --> 18:02.890]  speak on that a little bit joy like what would you look for and purchasing a
[18:02.890 --> 18:07.810]  piece of land just getting into permaculture well that's really gonna
[18:07.810 --> 18:12.650]  come down to the person purchasing its context you know I've got a permaculture
[18:12.650 --> 18:17.450]  background and permaculture is a design system that works really well for
[18:17.450 --> 18:21.730]  designing a farm you know it's the placement of all these elements and
[18:21.730 --> 18:24.770]  different relationships between all these elements it's not so much why did
[18:24.770 --> 18:28.210]  you put the why did you put a chicken coop here it's why did you put it there
[18:28.210 --> 18:33.010]  in relation to all these other elements so in permaculture and we're going out
[18:33.010 --> 18:36.010]  to visit a farm whether it's the first time or if I was going to look at a
[18:36.010 --> 18:40.850]  piece of land with the potential buyer we start with a client's interview you
[18:40.850 --> 18:44.330]  know we really need to get to know this client what are their needs what is
[18:44.330 --> 18:47.930]  their context what are they trying to do there is this a homestead where they
[18:47.930 --> 18:51.770]  want to live and raise their family and be super private and away from the world
[18:51.770 --> 18:55.490]  and be self-sufficient is this a property where they want to do market
[18:55.490 --> 18:59.330]  gardening and have a farm stand and have classroom and welcome people to space is
[18:59.330 --> 19:03.170]  this property that's going to be commercial cannabis cultivation these
[19:03.170 --> 19:06.770]  are gonna you know these factors are gonna play into the type of land you're
[19:06.770 --> 19:09.690]  looking for are you looking for privacy are you looking for something with easy
[19:09.850 --> 19:23.890]  access so visitors can get there really easily you know so that's really that's
[19:23.890 --> 19:29.570]  really what it comes down to you know do you need a lot of acreage do you want to
[19:29.570 --> 19:32.810]  have animals you know what do you want your day to day to be like do you want
[19:32.810 --> 19:35.810]  to wake up in the morning and go feed the chickens and then go feed the
[19:35.810 --> 19:39.810]  alpacas and then go feed the sheep or and then go rotate the cows through the
[19:39.810 --> 19:45.210]  paddocks you know a lot of people do want that but you know you get a milk
[19:45.210 --> 19:48.810]  goat you need to be milking that goat every day that's your life you are now
[19:48.810 --> 19:52.970]  married to that goat you're gonna spend a lot more time twerking those
[19:52.970 --> 19:57.090]  twerking those nipples than any other one so it's really figuring out your
[19:57.090 --> 20:02.890]  context you know things I would look for in a farm if I'm if I'm growing cannabis
[20:02.890 --> 20:06.650]  I would certainly look for privacy even if it is legal and licensed and under
[20:06.650 --> 20:12.210]  cameras out here now and humble but everything's licensed you have people
[20:12.210 --> 20:15.570]  building their grows right on the side of the road these are the ones getting
[20:15.570 --> 20:19.090]  robbed they're sitting ducks they're easy to pick off even with a little guard
[20:19.090 --> 20:23.170]  there and a little and a little guard box a little security box and some
[20:23.170 --> 20:27.170]  cameras you know you've got a gang of tweakers with guns they don't care
[20:27.170 --> 20:32.890]  they're coming in so privacy one of the biggest things I see bring down the
[20:32.890 --> 20:40.090]  quality of people's cannabis is dust so I would be looking for a place where I
[20:40.090 --> 20:44.890]  can cite my garden site my cannabis or my veggie gardens away from roads away
[20:44.890 --> 20:49.530]  from dust out here in Northern California it's a lot of dirt dusty
[20:49.530 --> 20:55.570]  roads in these rural areas so making sure that I can either plant dust breaks
[20:55.570 --> 20:58.370]  and wind breaks that are gonna block that dust so it's not getting on my
[20:58.370 --> 21:04.770]  cannabis and then we you know the big one out here is fire fire danger what's
[21:04.770 --> 21:08.730]  the fire history of that land did a fire come through there in the last 10 20
[21:08.730 --> 21:11.330]  years that might have took out a lot of those fire ladders and a lot of that
[21:11.330 --> 21:14.770]  material that could easily go up and start you know burn down your whole
[21:14.770 --> 21:19.330]  neighborhood is this an area that hasn't burned for 70 80 years and it's just
[21:19.330 --> 21:24.370]  ripe for a fire to rip through there where are the fire sectors you know
[21:24.370 --> 21:28.210]  usually fires traveling up hill where's the where the afternoon wind so those
[21:28.210 --> 21:32.410]  are what whipped the fire up the hills up so just these are the things to take
[21:32.410 --> 21:38.730]  into into account in down in Lake County where my girlfriend's farm is they've
[21:38.730 --> 21:42.770]  had big fires there over the last 10 years almost every summer they get big
[21:42.770 --> 21:45.210]  fires ripping through there so you see a lot of these properties that are for
[21:45.210 --> 21:50.370]  sale that beautiful property no house driveway foundation for the garage
[21:50.370 --> 21:54.370]  foundation for the house and you know you've got to look at where are these
[21:54.370 --> 22:00.010]  roads can these roads act as fire breaks so these are definitely the things I'll
[22:00.010 --> 22:04.770]  be looking at right off the bat your water is a big one up here in Humboldt
[22:04.770 --> 22:08.790]  County we have watersheds that are considered impacted watersheds and they
[22:08.790 --> 22:12.410]  are now tapped out they've issued so many cannabis licenses that they will
[22:12.410 --> 22:17.170]  no longer issue any more cultivation licenses in those watersheds Salmon Creek
[22:17.170 --> 22:24.450]  is a very famous one you salmon Creek bigfoot hey cuties but unfortunately
[22:24.450 --> 22:28.530]  unless you you know you're not going to be able to expand same thing in certain
[22:28.530 --> 22:32.290]  areas of Bryson where I was working on a project called Googleville this spring
[22:32.290 --> 22:35.930]  those guys were allowed to expand because they had some existing
[22:35.930 --> 22:40.850]  cultivation but so water is a big one you can do rainwater catchment and we
[22:40.850 --> 22:45.210]  all should be but certainly if you have springs or streams coming through your
[22:45.210 --> 22:49.690]  water and know the water rights you know you have to get access to that
[22:49.690 --> 22:54.970]  water this is going to become the most valuable resource around here is the
[22:54.970 --> 22:59.650]  water it already is we've had Humboldt County looking at passing an ordinance
[22:59.650 --> 23:04.730]  last month banning any any future planting of any licensed cannabis for
[23:04.730 --> 23:07.850]  the year they weren't gonna let people replant their depths because of the
[23:07.850 --> 23:12.790]  water usage that's only gonna take out your licensed farmer it doesn't do
[23:12.790 --> 23:17.190]  anything for your traditional market farmers so they ended up not passing
[23:17.190 --> 23:23.990]  that but you know water is the big one dust privacy no one is pollution you
[23:23.990 --> 23:27.510]  know if you want to live out there and be you know bathing in nature every day
[23:27.510 --> 23:30.870]  you don't want to hear the highway you don't want to hear neighbors shooting
[23:30.870 --> 23:34.670]  guns or riding motorcycles or maybe that's the property you're looking for
[23:34.670 --> 23:37.030]  where you can shoot guns and ride motorcycles you don't want to be
[23:37.030 --> 23:41.990]  impacting your neighbors either so that's all good but it's really about
[23:41.990 --> 23:44.990]  your context you know we'd have to interview that client a little more
[23:44.990 --> 23:49.110]  find out what they're looking for what do they really need a lot of times when
[23:49.110 --> 23:52.190]  I go out to these farms and they're saying I want to Google Villa my own I
[23:52.190 --> 23:56.150]  want to expand I want to do all this and I have to really reel these people in a
[23:56.150 --> 23:59.230]  lot of times and say you know well you're already tapped out right now you
[23:59.230 --> 24:02.670]  don't have enough time to go play with your toys or go play with your family
[24:02.670 --> 24:06.830]  you know you're already making a decent living you know we kind of need to
[24:06.830 --> 24:10.430]  apply some self-regulation to ourselves sometimes and most of the time I got
[24:10.430 --> 24:13.910]  these properties I'm talking them out of doing these projects something saying
[24:13.910 --> 24:18.110]  permaculture is consider energy saved as a yield if you didn't do that big
[24:18.110 --> 24:21.190]  expansion or that big two three month project or they have all that money
[24:21.190 --> 24:25.070]  that's a huge yield you just say that you can put that for something maybe a
[24:25.070 --> 24:30.070]  little more sustainable or generative or maybe you're just saving your time
[24:30.070 --> 24:33.910]  people really don't value their time enough in this industries this canvas
[24:33.910 --> 24:39.270]  industry especially so yeah I would start there start with that client
[24:39.270 --> 24:44.150]  really dive deep into the context of what you're trying to accomplish.
[24:44.150 --> 24:48.310]  Can we go a little deeper with that just with one thing because I know with land
[24:48.310 --> 24:51.870]  you know that's obviously a huge purchase and I had always heard you know
[24:51.870 --> 24:54.830]  one of the first things you're looking for is obviously a clean water source
[24:54.830 --> 24:59.350]  and the second one is the health of the trees can we kind of go into the more
[24:59.350 --> 25:03.190]  depth of that of you know what you're really looking for when you are scoping
[25:03.190 --> 25:08.910]  a larger piece of land and you are kind of scanning that that field for the
[25:08.910 --> 25:15.310]  trees. Sure well we have a very sick landscape out here unfortunately you
[25:15.310 --> 25:20.670]  know we're on stolen land here this was Wailaki land and the Wailakis knew how
[25:20.670 --> 25:25.550]  to manage this landscape as a food force this is a mixed oak woodland here and
[25:25.550 --> 25:30.310]  one of their primary sources of food was acorns and they knew that every two
[25:30.310 --> 25:34.790]  three four years they would burn under the oak trees and that would burn up the
[25:34.790 --> 25:38.510]  small firs the Douglas firs or the next successional tree that would come and
[25:38.510 --> 25:44.070]  overgrow the overgrow the oaks and destroy their habitat so they knew if
[25:44.070 --> 25:47.710]  they burned up the young small firs and burned up the small brush it would
[25:47.710 --> 25:53.750]  fertilize the land it helps it helps it helps kill any pests and pathogens that
[25:53.750 --> 25:59.030]  might be growing in the acorns that are building up under those trees so this
[25:59.030 --> 26:01.310]  is the other part of when they would harvest those acorns they would gather
[26:01.310 --> 26:04.070]  up all the other acorns even if they weren't going to use them they would get
[26:04.070 --> 26:07.510]  them out under those under the best oak trees so they wouldn't bring in worms
[26:07.510 --> 26:11.590]  and pathogens to those trees so they really know how to manage this forest
[26:11.590 --> 26:16.550]  over the last you know 80 years the burning has stopped here and so now you
[26:16.550 --> 26:21.950]  have the Douglas firs have overgrown the oak woodlands there's less food sources
[26:21.950 --> 26:25.390]  you have thick woods with no animals traveling through there because there's
[26:25.390 --> 26:30.070]  no other food sources the Sun can't hit the forest floor and grow these other
[26:30.070 --> 26:35.910]  these other plants so you know I'm here on the west on the east side of Southern
[26:35.910 --> 26:39.230]  Humboldt the east side of the highway as we call it's a little more dry it's
[26:39.230 --> 26:42.990]  a little more inland on the west side of the highway as you get a little closer
[26:42.990 --> 26:49.070]  to the coast you get this tan oak woodland that is really overgrown I mean
[26:49.070 --> 26:53.470]  it is so thick there are very few animals moving through there the best
[26:53.470 --> 26:57.750]  thing you could do for that forest would be to really thin it out ship build
[26:57.750 --> 27:01.750]  Googles even burn stuff if you need to because that the forest there is just so
[27:01.750 --> 27:06.110]  thick so you know I can kind of get an idea of what the property is going to
[27:06.110 --> 27:10.830]  look like just knowing the area of the county that it's in and then when we get
[27:10.830 --> 27:15.270]  out there we look for sick trees we have the sudden oak death up here that is
[27:15.270 --> 27:20.230]  taking out oak trees it's even taking out the drone trees so you want to look
[27:20.230 --> 27:24.670]  for these sick trees you want to drop those trees those trees can spread
[27:24.670 --> 27:29.070]  contamination one of the things we use in our natural farming we use the
[27:29.070 --> 27:33.990]  mistletoe as a time phosphorus we use that the flowering program I'm about to
[27:33.990 --> 27:39.470]  start feeding that a couple of weeks to my cannabis the mistletoe is an invasive
[27:39.470 --> 27:43.470]  you know it's a parasite on those oak trees so you know we look for healthy
[27:43.470 --> 27:46.950]  trees if you see a lot of that mistletoe you want to cut that out of there use
[27:46.950 --> 27:52.350]  that you can throw it in your Googles you can you can ferment it yeah we're
[27:52.350 --> 27:55.550]  looking at what are the resources in that forest I don't mind a forest that's
[27:55.550 --> 27:59.230]  full of dead rotted material I'm gonna build Google's like crazy out of that
[27:59.230 --> 28:03.310]  I'd rather have a property that has a forest that needs to be thinned out and
[28:03.310 --> 28:08.350]  managed on a property that's just bare grass open fields at least I've got
[28:08.350 --> 28:11.830]  something to work with I know I've got microbes there in the forest I can start
[28:11.830 --> 28:17.230]  building soil I can cut rameal chip wood out of there from the deciduous trees in
[28:17.230 --> 28:25.150]  the springtime really build soil that way so yeah looking at the forest you
[28:25.150 --> 28:29.750]  know you just got to kind of see what's in there you have read you have
[28:29.750 --> 28:33.750]  properties here that are closer to the closer to the rivers and lower in
[28:33.750 --> 28:38.830]  elevation and those have a lot more redwood trees around them you know the
[28:38.830 --> 28:43.550]  redwoods are alligopathic nothing wants to grow around them so we don't we don't
[28:43.550 --> 28:48.870]  garden around them we don't use that wood in our Google culture beds so yeah
[28:48.870 --> 28:52.230]  you know I've got some clients up in Arcata but their property is surrounded
[28:52.230 --> 28:58.350]  by redwood trees and we have to bring in other materials to to build beds out
[28:58.350 --> 29:03.750]  of and to build their soil with and and yeah so just working with the forest
[29:03.750 --> 29:08.950]  working with what you got and and learning to manage that forest it's full
[29:08.950 --> 29:13.070]  of resources for us you know but we have to get in there start thinning it out
[29:13.070 --> 29:16.590]  cutting it out making room for the animals and making room for that
[29:16.590 --> 29:21.390]  sunlight to hit the forest floor so that other plants can grow their berries and
[29:21.390 --> 29:26.510]  things are gonna bring in the deer and bring in the rabbits so yeah that's
[29:26.510 --> 29:29.470]  kind of the first thing I'm looking at
[29:32.030 --> 29:36.830]  listen I'm gonna hop in on the conversation now Joey good to see you
[29:36.830 --> 29:41.750]  again brother it's been it's been a couple years since I was last up there
[29:41.750 --> 29:45.230]  and looking forward to get it up there this fall and I was horrified to hear
[29:45.230 --> 29:50.830]  that you know the last two years of your hard work is now being left behind
[29:50.830 --> 29:55.910]  to some new owner who knows who and all that I mean I was really excited when
[29:55.910 --> 30:00.550]  you're putting that program together you know what a resource Hartwood is you
[30:00.550 --> 30:05.230]  know with all of the dorms and kitchens and I mean it was it was just the
[30:05.230 --> 30:10.830]  perfect place you know off the beaten highway it was it's awesome yeah yeah
[30:10.830 --> 30:17.190]  we were up there for the Dem hive meeting a couple years back and really
[30:17.190 --> 30:21.750]  got to tour the place and spend a beautiful long weekend up there and
[30:21.750 --> 30:27.990]  again heartbroken that that didn't pan out and you know that the pandemic set
[30:27.990 --> 30:31.630]  in and shut you know shut out that down I mean that was gonna be like an
[30:31.630 --> 30:38.630]  incredible campus but um welcome to the new world order right that being said
[30:38.630 --> 30:44.790]  thank you again for all the hard work you're doing Marco you too bro deep love
[30:44.790 --> 30:49.590]  and respect to you guys for for doing this work and I think the more of us
[30:49.590 --> 30:54.270]  that are doing it the better chance that we are going to be able to make a big
[30:54.270 --> 31:00.030]  impact you know and yeah start small you know maybe it's a tent growth right now
[31:00.030 --> 31:05.430]  but yeah the potential for you to expand outside and into you know a garden space
[31:05.430 --> 31:09.670]  and start using some of these permacultural practices you know that
[31:09.670 --> 31:16.270]  the base of permaculture spend a year studying the land and you know I've had
[31:16.270 --> 31:21.150]  a lot of permacultural friends we've had some pretty intense debates about you
[31:21.150 --> 31:25.870]  know well that's that's great and that worked awesome in the 70s but now
[31:25.870 --> 31:31.190]  everything is extreme weather and you can't count on X amount of rain you
[31:31.190 --> 31:36.550]  can't count on prevailing winds and or you know prevention dust prevention
[31:36.550 --> 31:41.950]  because you know everything is getting like crazy so you know those principles
[31:41.950 --> 31:45.590]  are really important to think about and take into consideration but you've got
[31:45.590 --> 31:51.070]  to be ready to pivot on a moment's notice nowadays and I think that you
[31:51.070 --> 31:54.910]  know you're you guys both Marco and you are you know indicating that yeah
[31:54.910 --> 32:00.510]  there's there's a lot more to take into consideration now that we're in this
[32:00.510 --> 32:06.150]  kind of volatile time and you know these JDOM and KNF principles are critical
[32:06.750 --> 32:12.030]  with that foundational permaculture of what to grow where so that you know when
[32:12.030 --> 32:16.150]  you do get rain you don't lose it all doesn't just run off the property and so
[32:16.150 --> 32:20.950]  you know there's so many topics I want to dive in on right now you know these
[32:20.950 --> 32:27.590]  current events that are going on between the crash of cannabis value in NorCal
[32:27.590 --> 32:32.950]  and down here in SoCal we're smoking shit we can't get the real McCoy and
[32:33.510 --> 32:40.710]  speak for yourself Layton. All right Peter what do you know that I don't know?
[32:40.710 --> 32:47.030]  Just quickly before you guys move on topically Marco can you add some of your
[32:47.030 --> 32:52.110]  checklist items of things you evaluate when you're thinking of purchasing land
[32:52.110 --> 32:57.830]  just to complete that topic? Yeah definitely we are I think I lost a
[32:57.830 --> 33:02.950]  little bit of what Joey was saying technical but and I will be watching
[33:02.950 --> 33:09.310]  this back but I'm gonna I bought a piece of land about two years ago so I'm doing
[33:09.310 --> 33:15.590]  something similar to permaculture I'm actually in the city limits though in a
[33:15.590 --> 33:20.910]  little section called Old Town and it's basically properties that are you know
[33:20.910 --> 33:27.750]  like pre-civil war old stuff down there and I was lucky enough to get a piece of
[33:27.750 --> 33:32.990]  land which is a little under an acre that's a good size you know for my area
[33:32.990 --> 33:40.750]  and so I didn't have a lot of choice in this property but what I did see was
[33:40.750 --> 33:45.790]  that I could I could work with what was there because it was it's an old
[33:45.790 --> 33:51.030]  property and I don't know the history my biggest the biggest thing I've been
[33:51.030 --> 33:57.510]  focusing on is bringing organic material to the land I did that by way of I was
[33:57.510 --> 34:02.710]  able to recycle a lot of the wood chips that the city was cutting down they
[34:02.710 --> 34:07.410]  trim the trees every year I hooked up with a local landscaper that does a lot
[34:07.410 --> 34:13.550]  of shredded leaves so step one for me is because I didn't know what all was done
[34:13.550 --> 34:18.830]  on this land over the many years I just wanted to kind of build on top and then
[34:18.830 --> 34:23.350]  from there after I build this base layer you know I went from there I went
[34:23.350 --> 34:28.870]  hugelkultur so I went even on top of the even further so what that did was
[34:28.870 --> 34:33.190]  that let me just kind of have more control knowing what my plants are
[34:33.190 --> 34:38.790]  growing in a couple of the checklist like Joey said you don't want to be too
[34:38.790 --> 34:43.310]  close to the streets and highways I'm very you know I'm the same with that and
[34:43.310 --> 34:47.790]  I didn't have a lot of choice in that being in the city so like he said I did
[34:47.790 --> 34:53.990]  breaks so I did some espalier pears and I have those growing like a wall I
[34:53.990 --> 34:59.110]  planted a lot of like Leland Cypress those are great they grow big and
[34:59.110 --> 35:05.910]  they're like a nice windbreak type plant but overall things I look for is just
[35:05.910 --> 35:10.910]  you know the neighborhood like like Joey said how are the neighbors what do they
[35:10.910 --> 35:16.510]  have going next door you know am I they impacting me would I be impacting them
[35:16.510 --> 35:22.390]  so yes a lot of the same things that Joey mentioned and then I'm just
[35:22.390 --> 35:27.150]  focusing on the soil as number one bringing in that organic material and
[35:27.150 --> 35:34.170]  then you know going from there it's kind of my my approach yeah and I didn't even
[35:34.170 --> 35:41.170]  touch on that question yeah no I started water water and then soil tests and
[35:41.170 --> 35:46.210]  understanding the impact of the land and you know Marco that that I understand
[35:46.210 --> 35:51.490]  your situation and you got blessed but you know the most important thing is do
[35:51.490 --> 35:55.290]  your research I mean no no where you're landing and I love what you did by
[35:55.290 --> 35:58.770]  putting down that layer that buffer of chips and everything and then going on
[35:58.770 --> 36:03.610]  top now you're not subject to dealing with whatever was there before you
[36:03.610 --> 36:10.650]  arrived so that was a great gold nugget there for sure but yeah I mean just do
[36:10.650 --> 36:14.370]  your research do your due diligence before you purchase anything and
[36:14.370 --> 36:19.090]  understand that if you do not have water you're in trouble California is
[36:19.090 --> 36:29.650]  getting crazy about water out here and it's just beginning so yeah I mean so
[36:29.650 --> 36:33.090]  much to that but you know if it was a client I'd be like all right what do you
[36:33.090 --> 36:36.850]  want this place to be when it grows up what is your long-term goals and then
[36:36.850 --> 36:40.290]  back out of it and and like Joey says more often than not you're basically
[36:40.290 --> 36:43.650]  talking them out of it because they don't they haven't thought this all the
[36:43.650 --> 36:48.210]  way through what the commitment is and that's a big one knowing what you want
[36:48.210 --> 36:53.450]  what you want to do yourself before you even start start looking what one
[36:53.450 --> 36:58.010]  question I'm sorry to cut you off Leighton I wanted to jump in there joy
[36:58.010 --> 37:03.290]  so you so you worked your place it's been about two years and now you know
[37:03.290 --> 37:08.210]  they're gonna sell it do you have you thought about and you know because the
[37:08.210 --> 37:11.970]  work you did is that is great work okay so now you're leaving that land better
[37:11.970 --> 37:18.050]  than it was when you got there do you have you done any research on like how
[37:18.050 --> 37:23.850]  long those the work you did and kind of the efforts you put into that land will
[37:23.850 --> 37:29.850]  last before they kind of fade back away or is that a benefit that will forever
[37:29.850 --> 37:34.610]  be there because you can never take all of something away you would always be
[37:34.610 --> 37:43.090]  left with something that makes sense yeah yeah well certainly we would built
[37:43.090 --> 37:46.170]  a garden here last year that I'm growing my cannabis in this year we call the
[37:46.170 --> 37:50.490]  Buddha garden and that's a nice that's all it's all Google's that I built a
[37:50.490 --> 37:55.570]  year from this last May those beds are certainly going to be fertile for the
[37:55.570 --> 38:01.930]  next 30 40 years a lot of wood into those big deep trenches we have a skid
[38:01.930 --> 38:07.770]  steer here with a backhoe thick forest here with endless endless wood material
[38:07.770 --> 38:13.130]  so well I didn't spend much money other than the equipment my time I didn't
[38:13.130 --> 38:17.650]  spend any money on really materials they got about one inch of compost on over the
[38:17.650 --> 38:22.690]  top of those beds the wood that went into that the nitrogen layers that went
[38:22.690 --> 38:28.250]  into that I feel those beds are going to be producing for a long time to come
[38:28.250 --> 38:34.450]  pretty proud of that work we've done some swale systems here certainly done a
[38:34.450 --> 38:38.170]  lot of work just trying to educate the team here on thinning this forest
[38:38.170 --> 38:44.130]  properly you know storing those those those otherwise waste streams instead
[38:44.130 --> 38:47.610]  of just burning all this wood hey these straight thin poles let's stockpile
[38:47.610 --> 38:52.770]  these we can use these for junk full fence you know we can use these for a
[38:52.770 --> 38:58.170]  lot of natural building materials so you know trying to leave some knowledge
[38:58.170 --> 39:01.970]  here with the land team that will hopefully stay on no matter who takes
[39:01.970 --> 39:07.770]  this place over there is an offer on the place right now I got to give a tour to
[39:07.770 --> 39:11.530]  a potential buyer a couple weeks ago who was totally awesome and I really hope he
[39:11.530 --> 39:18.210]  gets to buy the place because he got the vision he's a ganja guy he totally got
[39:18.210 --> 39:22.290]  the vision and I would stay on and happily work with that guy so we'll see
[39:22.290 --> 39:27.290]  part what's not down and out yet and you know another transformation could be
[39:27.290 --> 39:31.210]  just around the corner hopefully someone with some more energy and resources for
[39:31.210 --> 39:39.810]  it and but it's all here and you know yeah we've built inputs in large-scale
[39:39.810 --> 39:44.850]  you know I've got 50 gallon drums of ferments here that the current scale
[39:44.850 --> 39:48.770]  they're growing at it's gonna take a long time for them to use up so we've
[39:48.770 --> 39:53.410]  been selling them in the neighborhood but you know it's hard to teach old dogs
[39:53.410 --> 39:56.850]  new tricks the growers in this immediate neighborhood around me the Palo Verde
[39:56.850 --> 40:00.130]  Appalachian they've been growing for almost 50 years you know these guys this
[40:00.130 --> 40:04.290]  neighborhood they started in the 70s here I was really blessed to have a
[40:04.290 --> 40:09.010]  couple of these oh geez for parents of my friends that I grew up with come to
[40:09.010 --> 40:13.410]  this last boot camp and embrace some of these practices and tell me oh they'd
[40:13.410 --> 40:16.930]  seen the videos and they're making ferments at home I mean these were some
[40:16.930 --> 40:20.610]  of the first people ever plant cannabis seeds in Humboldt County so that
[40:20.610 --> 40:23.730]  meant a lot to me you know they've watched this industry change so many
[40:23.730 --> 40:28.970]  times they've watched it you know watching it crumble right now and there
[40:28.970 --> 40:32.730]  you know it is hard to teach an old dog new tricks but these people are up
[40:32.730 --> 40:35.690]  against the wall and they've been creative and they've adapted so many
[40:35.690 --> 40:40.170]  times before whether it was growing in the guerrilla ways in the forest up in
[40:40.170 --> 40:46.250]  trees or it was taking it indoors or it was you know turning to extraction every
[40:46.250 --> 40:50.570]  farmer here became an extraction expert in the last 10 years because we had we
[40:50.570 --> 40:57.210]  just had to change with the markets so yeah just try to share that knowledge
[40:57.210 --> 41:01.730]  and leave as much of that knowledge here where it's accessible and and yeah build
[41:01.730 --> 41:06.330]  as many of these systems that are gonna last a long time whether I'm here or
[41:06.330 --> 41:11.730]  somebody else will be here my sister she worked in that Buddha garden 30
[41:11.730 --> 41:15.450]  years ago it was a tiny little herb garden and then it's been then it kind
[41:15.450 --> 41:19.650]  of was overgrown for 20 years nothing happened in there and then I got to come
[41:19.650 --> 41:23.250]  back and build those foodles so it's nice to know there's gonna be a
[41:23.250 --> 41:29.570]  beautiful garden there for you know decades you know let's let's touch on
[41:29.570 --> 41:34.590]  those swales I don't think the audience knows about water harvesting and sinking
[41:34.590 --> 41:39.190]  water into the groundwater instead of letting it run off the properties so can
[41:39.190 --> 41:44.830]  you go into details about some of the swales that you put on? Yeah swales are an awesome
[41:44.830 --> 41:50.630]  technique we use a lot of permaculture design and it's basically a ditch dug on
[41:50.630 --> 41:54.310]  contour on the slope this means it's running level on a slope you've got a
[41:54.310 --> 41:58.990]  hill coming down here and you've got your your swale running this way the
[41:58.990 --> 42:02.550]  water is gonna go down the slope it's gonna hit that swale it's gonna get
[42:02.550 --> 42:06.350]  slowed down it's gonna spread out because it's perfectly level and it's
[42:06.350 --> 42:10.230]  gonna slowly sink into the landscape we like to build these we like to build our
[42:10.230 --> 42:15.230]  hugelkultur beds on contour so when the water hits it same thing it's spread out
[42:15.230 --> 42:22.230]  sinks down into that carbon layer that sponge so swales are an awesome tool for
[42:22.230 --> 42:26.630]  stopping and slowing down that water before it rushes off your property with
[42:26.630 --> 42:29.750]  permaculture always trying to capture and store the energy and cycle it
[42:29.750 --> 42:32.630]  through as many of these natural systems as we can before it leaves our
[42:32.630 --> 42:37.550]  land so we want to slow it down out here in Humboldt County it's steep mountains
[42:37.550 --> 42:41.470]  everybody hears you know I go like this anybody have land like this this look
[42:41.470 --> 42:45.350]  like your land it's like most people's land out here your lands like this you're
[42:45.350 --> 42:52.550]  lucky most of us have this so the water is rushing off that landscape and it's
[42:52.550 --> 42:56.070]  taking your topsoil all your nutrients with it so we want to slow it down
[42:56.070 --> 43:00.550]  spread it out sink it and then at the overflows of these we're armoring the
[43:00.550 --> 43:04.190]  ends of those with rocks so they're not getting worn away and when it overflows
[43:04.190 --> 43:08.030]  it's gonna overflow down to the next swale system on the next contour line
[43:08.030 --> 43:11.950]  it's just gonna keep going through your landscape we're slowing it down as many
[43:11.950 --> 43:16.470]  times as we can we're getting that water to sink deep down into the water table
[43:16.470 --> 43:23.110]  so it's the simplest technique for for water storage for capturing that rain
[43:23.110 --> 43:26.950]  water something everybody can do with a pickaxe you don't even need an a-frame
[43:26.950 --> 43:30.950]  level which is what we use I mean just eyeball just try to make a straight line
[43:30.950 --> 43:34.270]  across the hill it's a little harder than you'd think but you start playing
[43:34.270 --> 43:39.270]  with it and so these swales can be huge we can build these with heavy equipment
[43:39.270 --> 43:43.470]  with bulldozer blades it's you know it's how much water are you capturing is this
[43:43.470 --> 43:47.470]  a huge slope with you know thousands of gallons of water they're gonna come down
[43:47.470 --> 43:51.030]  it or is this a bunch of water coming off a road where you've got a huge bunch
[43:51.270 --> 43:55.950]  that would go into a ditch capture that water right there and send it into your
[43:55.950 --> 44:00.830]  swale and swales can be used to move water around your property you might
[44:00.830 --> 44:04.550]  have a foot of drop in 300 feet but you're trying to eventually get the
[44:04.550 --> 44:08.470]  water yeah through the swale over to this Ridge on your property where you've
[44:08.470 --> 44:12.670]  got pond where you can then store more water and then it overflows out of there
[44:12.670 --> 44:16.230]  down into another set of swales or Google's down below that irrigates your
[44:16.230 --> 44:21.830]  garden gravity feeds down below there hey this is coming out of dams on
[44:21.830 --> 44:27.030]  dragonfly love you guys man thanks for thanks for joining us today and yeah
[44:27.030 --> 44:33.190]  what this whales going on oh here we go there it is yeah that's gonna ask you
[44:33.190 --> 44:38.710]  what about the width and depth how do you determine that Joey you know that's
[44:38.710 --> 44:41.870]  all gonna be determined by how much water you've got coming off that slope
[44:41.870 --> 44:44.730]  like I just said if you have a lot of water you don't want that thing
[44:44.730 --> 44:47.730]  undersized you need to go out there when it starts raining and you might
[44:47.730 --> 44:52.290]  need to be digging that thing out while it's raining so so to maximize that
[44:52.290 --> 44:57.770]  swale you get it to the point where it doesn't overflow and then you know got
[44:57.770 --> 45:05.690]  it well it's about yeah it's gonna overflow out of the ends of it you don't
[45:05.690 --> 45:08.930]  want it to be holding water too long because if it builds up it could blow
[45:08.930 --> 45:13.570]  out potentially especially in an extreme storm event you know we have to prepare
[45:13.570 --> 45:19.930]  if these hundred-year storm events up here so you want to have them not be so
[45:19.930 --> 45:23.930]  long everything needs to be cited appropriately for your site sized
[45:23.930 --> 45:26.930]  appropriately for your site for the amount of flow that's going to go
[45:26.930 --> 45:30.930]  through there bigger is better you know you want it overflowing though to go
[45:30.930 --> 45:35.410]  down into the next set of swales into the next system so you have breaks in
[45:35.410 --> 45:40.610]  them every so far those are the ones that you arm it with the rocks but yeah
[45:40.610 --> 45:45.210]  I want to just say again big shout out Josh and Kelly Dragonfly Earth Medicine
[45:45.210 --> 45:49.730]  they're such inspiration to me and to so many in our community they certainly
[45:49.730 --> 45:52.770]  brought me and Layton together at that damn pure hive gathering that we had up
[45:52.770 --> 45:58.650]  here two years ago and those guys just continually inspire me to keep learning
[45:58.650 --> 46:02.890]  and try to find better ways to do this and work you know work closer with the
[46:02.890 --> 46:07.130]  planet and with plants and just eternally grateful to you guys you've
[46:07.130 --> 46:10.410]  really helped bring our community together and shine a bright light on all
[46:10.410 --> 46:14.450]  these practices and people that are doing them so yeah just much love to
[46:14.450 --> 46:18.050]  Josh and Kelly anybody that doesn't know them you've got a you've got a look up
[46:18.050 --> 46:22.490]  Dragonfly Earth Medicine and devour everything those guys are throwing down
[46:22.490 --> 46:27.890]  they are the epitome of you know a beautiful regenerative home and farm and
[46:27.890 --> 46:33.890]  lifestyle and just much love to you guys we love you we love you guys so much I
[46:33.890 --> 46:40.370]  thank you for all you do we can't say it enough so yeah big ups Josh and Kelly
[46:40.370 --> 46:46.610]  comments yeah and yeah Peter there's a guy that did an amazing water harvesting
[46:46.610 --> 46:51.970]  demonstration in Africa so Google water harvesting Africa and he talks about
[46:51.970 --> 46:57.890]  these swales and the ends where he makes smiles so the swale comes out hits a
[46:57.890 --> 47:02.750]  smile and the water goes around both corners of that berm or swale into
[47:02.750 --> 47:07.270]  another set of smiles so basically it's go out to your land look where there's
[47:07.270 --> 47:11.670]  erosion and that's where you start and then you start looking you know what
[47:11.670 --> 47:15.790]  else has come what else is affecting this why is the water focused in this
[47:15.790 --> 47:20.030]  one point so chase it all the way back to the resource and then nothing I
[47:20.030 --> 47:25.070]  wanted to ask you Joey there was an incredible couple of springs up there or
[47:25.070 --> 47:29.830]  vernal pools did those dry out this year or are they still you know just like
[47:29.830 --> 47:34.430]  slowly leaking out water little ones I'm talking about we're definitely
[47:34.430 --> 47:40.230]  seeing springs dry up that have never dried up before you know we're at about
[47:40.230 --> 47:45.590]  half of our normal average rainfall for the year right now we've got a million
[47:45.590 --> 47:49.390]  gallon pond here this year that only filled up with about 200,000 gallons of
[47:49.390 --> 47:54.430]  rain this winter so that really impacted how much we planted you know we're doing
[47:54.430 --> 47:58.950]  about a 10th of the garden we were doing last year we did a big market garden
[47:58.950 --> 48:03.950]  last year and provided veggies to all our staff about 10 people living on the
[48:03.950 --> 48:09.030]  property here so yeah springs are dried up I've got a spring right above the
[48:09.030 --> 48:12.550]  Buddha garden that we use in the early spring and it flows through the summer
[48:12.550 --> 48:16.830]  and it fills up this nice pool and it's habitat frogs and salamanders and that
[48:16.830 --> 48:23.310]  dried up in May so yeah it's it's scary and I know a lot of people are in a
[48:23.310 --> 48:27.990]  really tough spot with their water right now down at my girlfriend farm
[48:27.990 --> 48:32.430]  girlfriend's farm tomorrow heal myself gardens in Lake County it's even drier
[48:32.430 --> 48:39.270]  down there it's even drier climate if it's 90 here it's 105 down there it and
[48:39.270 --> 48:44.750]  her well house recently burnt down they had a total fire on the farm and luckily
[48:44.750 --> 48:48.510]  we were able to put it out but she's been very getting really low on her
[48:48.510 --> 48:53.950]  water down there it's an even drier drier conditions down there you know
[48:53.950 --> 48:57.750]  ideally if you build a Google in those kind of conditions you don't want it
[48:57.750 --> 49:02.030]  above the ground dig a trench and have it actually your soil level actually
[49:02.030 --> 49:06.550]  below the ground so any water that does come is going to run into that bed and
[49:06.550 --> 49:10.350]  really sink and capture in there you're building swales you should build them
[49:10.350 --> 49:15.270]  really deep you should be building overflow pools that'll saturation pools
[49:15.270 --> 49:20.470]  with water really go into those pools and fill up and just drain you know dry
[49:20.470 --> 49:25.150]  land water harvesting is is even more extreme than what we need to do up here
[49:25.870 --> 49:32.110]  I was talking to a guy who took my last boot camp yesterday he has a farm down
[49:32.110 --> 49:38.110]  into New Mexico where it is all limestone you know it was all under under
[49:38.110 --> 49:43.710]  the ocean not too long ago it was coral and I know they have very little soil
[49:43.710 --> 49:48.670]  there they have a jungle but if they don't have big trees they don't have you
[49:48.670 --> 49:52.350]  know tall emergent trees they don't have a lot of soil so they're they're trying
[49:52.350 --> 49:55.270]  to figure out a build soil they're just not figuring out Google culture they're
[49:55.270 --> 50:01.510]  just not figuring out how to compost and start building that soil biomass I asked
[50:01.510 --> 50:05.390]  him can we can we build swales though can can we take a pickaxe and build
[50:05.390 --> 50:12.750]  swales he said no it's it's rock hard it's limestone it's so we're trying to
[50:12.750 --> 50:15.190]  figure out what we're gonna do down there we're talking about doing a
[50:15.190 --> 50:20.710]  workshop down there in January you know we're talking about probably using plant
[50:20.710 --> 50:24.830]  material chop and dropping and basically building a swale out of plant
[50:24.830 --> 50:30.470]  material the banana tree the cassava's you know just chopping up biomass and
[50:30.470 --> 50:34.350]  laying it out as though it's a Google but maybe we're not even covering it
[50:34.350 --> 50:40.550]  maybe it's just acting as a swale they get they get 44 inches of rain annually
[50:40.550 --> 50:47.390]  there which is a good amount but yeah he said they get it all in four months so
[50:47.390 --> 50:52.470]  it's an interesting climate you know let's let's talk about the materials to
[50:52.470 --> 50:57.350]  when you're when you're building a cubicle and you're sinking it you need
[50:57.350 --> 51:01.510]  to be looking for punky wood see the punky wood is going to soak up a
[51:01.510 --> 51:06.630]  tremendous amount more moisture than a brand new log so you know keep in mind
[51:06.630 --> 51:10.230]  the building materials you're working with and and it can even be chips you
[51:10.230 --> 51:14.310]  could be like sinking that punky log and then covering it with chips because the
[51:14.470 --> 51:18.310]  have been exposed and ripped open they're gonna have the ability to accept
[51:18.310 --> 51:22.350]  more moisture one of the one of the interesting projects I'm working on now
[51:22.350 --> 51:28.030]  which is is gone ground-up organic matter can only hold 55% moisture max
[51:28.030 --> 51:33.230]  like that's saturated soaking in water as it dries out in the Sun it's gonna
[51:33.230 --> 51:41.630]  drop to you know 40 35 30 max so you've only got 20% ability as water storage
[51:41.630 --> 51:46.190]  capacity in fresh new chips so that's where those old logs are gonna be your
[51:46.190 --> 51:50.830]  best friend in that circumstances where you're sinking those so keep that in
[51:50.830 --> 51:54.070]  mind think you know use your common sense when you're building or use it
[51:54.070 --> 51:58.070]  picking and selecting your building materials to do those type of fugals and
[51:58.070 --> 52:01.950]  Joey thank you for that nugget because that's a really important one if you're
[52:01.950 --> 52:05.990]  on a slope that's one thing if you're very flat landed that's a whole nother
[52:05.990 --> 52:13.710]  game so keep that in mind thank you that was a good one definitely and and
[52:13.710 --> 52:18.310]  those punky those punky dead logs something else not a lot of people know
[52:18.310 --> 52:21.990]  about but when we're building bugles on the hill a lot of times we're not even
[52:21.990 --> 52:25.430]  excavating we're just building them at ground level but when we're going to
[52:25.430 --> 52:28.870]  process that those logs in the forest we're cutting down a tree or there's
[52:28.870 --> 52:32.430]  already a log laying on the ground if it's got side branches on it we'll leave
[52:32.470 --> 52:35.910]  those we'll cut those and leave them about foot long and then we lay that
[52:35.910 --> 52:40.470]  bugle on the hill those branches will actually hold it in place and keep it
[52:40.470 --> 52:44.510]  from rolling down the hill you can interlock those logs together you know
[52:44.510 --> 52:48.510]  if we're on a slope we put the bigger logs on the bottom of the slope and the
[52:48.510 --> 52:54.230]  smaller logs on the top we're trying to put that flat deck but yeah leave those
[52:54.230 --> 52:57.750]  branches on and then at the end once you know if there's still little little nubs
[52:57.750 --> 53:00.950]  or little branches sticking out we come through with the saw and just knock them
[53:00.950 --> 53:06.870]  off and just walk that down yeah definitely that's a great point yeah
[53:06.870 --> 53:13.110]  yeah one thing that uh one thing that I noticed when I um I built some bugles
[53:13.110 --> 53:19.670]  and they're about a year old now well some of the wood actually grew so now I
[53:19.670 --> 53:24.350]  have like little oak trees trying to pop up and my bugles and certain trees and
[53:24.350 --> 53:30.230]  actually um ginkgo I got a ginkgo tree now that I'm gonna dig out of that you
[53:30.230 --> 53:34.150]  go and then move it but I think it's pretty cool that when you pile up that
[53:34.150 --> 53:39.950]  fresh wood you know you don't be in a rush you know one thing I did I built my
[53:39.950 --> 53:44.030]  beds last year and I didn't even plan in them this year because they were all
[53:44.030 --> 53:47.310]  just new wood you know what I mean so I just give them that year to kind of
[53:47.310 --> 53:52.390]  break down let them turn into that more punky wood like y'all say and then that
[53:52.390 --> 54:00.270]  just helps the process I think yeah and dragon dragon flies laying down nuggets
[54:00.270 --> 54:07.030]  hard in the comment right now morango you know plant friggin willows I forget
[54:07.030 --> 54:10.670]  you know bakashi I mean damn we should have we should fuck Peter where are you
[54:10.670 --> 54:18.710]  bust them in here on this topic I think Peter had to run some errands backstage
[54:18.710 --> 54:23.390]  yeah yeah mushroom spawn you guys you can get mushroom blocks everywhere
[54:23.390 --> 54:27.870]  spread that shit on your Hugo that'll help build the soil help store water
[54:27.870 --> 54:33.190]  help decompose those logs get a more punky quicker you know those are those
[54:33.190 --> 54:37.070]  are some really simple tricks that you can do you just got to find those
[54:37.070 --> 54:41.230]  resources you know do do your diligence man get to work and chase what's local
[54:41.230 --> 54:44.990]  like like Marco said get to know your neighbors find out what the resources
[54:44.990 --> 54:50.510]  are that are available locally now their internet's terrible I know you
[54:50.510 --> 54:54.310]  guys would have to go to town two and a half hours right to get there and then
[54:54.310 --> 54:59.870]  we'd be finishing we'll get you on another time guys I love you guys miss
[54:59.870 --> 55:05.950]  you but yeah back to back to swales and berms and and water harvesting I think
[55:05.950 --> 55:09.950]  that is going to be the future for all of us because we can't count on
[55:09.950 --> 55:14.970]  consistent rain and when it comes man if you don't sink it or store it it's gone
[55:14.970 --> 55:21.610]  and then you're they're back to friggin no water no water no life man so it's
[55:21.610 --> 55:26.530]  gonna be challenging in the future I mean here in LA we got two-tenths of an
[55:26.530 --> 55:33.010]  inch of rain all year that's that's horrifying you know so yeah we've got a
[55:33.010 --> 55:36.170]  lot a lot to worry about coming in the future and these are some really
[55:36.170 --> 55:41.130]  important tricks to help storing that water so that you do have resources to
[55:41.130 --> 55:44.690]  grow and Marco you guys out in New England are getting twice the rain now
[55:44.890 --> 55:49.410]  right yeah well Virginia we've been we've been loaded with rain it's been
[55:49.410 --> 55:55.370]  like a tropical rainforest but uh yeah I think even the whole East Coast is
[55:55.370 --> 56:00.330]  getting it really heavy this year but then two years ago I was just searching
[56:00.330 --> 56:05.770]  for water like I couldn't get enough I couldn't get enough rain so since two
[56:05.770 --> 56:09.610]  years I've had my property I've been focusing big on rain barrel storage
[56:09.610 --> 56:14.490]  rain barrel collection and I'd see some things that Joey's done in the past use
[56:14.850 --> 56:19.570]  use gravity for your you know to help you like collect your water high and let
[56:19.570 --> 56:22.730]  gravity pull it to your garden so you don't have to worry about trying to
[56:22.730 --> 56:26.330]  pump things you know just all those little things kind of you know help you
[56:26.330 --> 56:33.670]  out you know when you're when you're dealing with water issues hey I got a I
[56:33.670 --> 56:36.790]  got K&F here so I was wondering you guys want to kind of chop it up and talk
[56:36.790 --> 56:42.510]  about ferments and making extracts and just kind of adding to that toolbox if
[56:42.510 --> 56:46.870]  you will like you know I'm more I guess of a living soil guy I still have a lot
[56:46.870 --> 56:51.910]  to learn when it comes to those other aspects so you know I'm still trying to
[56:51.910 --> 56:55.950]  build my attributes I know that that you boys are on another level with that
[56:55.950 --> 57:00.990]  stuff so I if I can bring K&F in here I'd love for you guys to be able to talk
[57:00.990 --> 57:12.900]  ferments and kind of chop it up in that manner as well so mr. K&F wow this is
[57:12.900 --> 57:27.100]  gonna be a good one I'm humbled by the crowd here I got a question Joey um and
[57:27.100 --> 57:30.140]  then we can get kind of bounce it back and forth but I was just talking to a
[57:30.140 --> 57:37.180]  gentleman the other day and he was asking me about JADAM and JLFs and he's
[57:37.180 --> 57:41.860]  growing you know obviously growing up cannabis and his biggest question was
[57:41.860 --> 57:46.940]  you know like a lot of cannabis growers everyone looks for a regimen or routine
[57:46.940 --> 57:52.760]  or where's the feeding chart you know kind of thing and what I've come to you
[57:52.760 --> 57:57.060]  know find out about JADAM and JLFs and those kind of things the strength of
[57:57.060 --> 58:02.580]  them changes like the one I make here with the ingredients I have be totally
[58:02.580 --> 58:07.420]  different than you may make in your place and ingredients you have so what
[58:07.420 --> 58:11.740]  I've come to do is just kind of test them for strength that I'm not that you
[58:11.780 --> 58:16.180]  know gonna burn my plants and then I kind of just use the idea if I'm in
[58:16.180 --> 58:21.300]  veg I'm gonna use more JLFs which were made with leafy plants such as comfrey
[58:21.300 --> 58:26.020]  and nettle and if I'm flower I like to move more towards things I make with
[58:26.020 --> 58:31.320]  fruit and that kind of thing um can you speak kind of on how your methods of
[58:31.320 --> 58:35.420]  using JADAM and how you kind of feed and that kind of thing and then that kind of
[58:35.420 --> 58:39.060]  kick us off into maybe ferments and that kind of stuff
[58:39.060 --> 58:45.620]  yeah well you nailed it right there testing is the crucial thing and with
[58:45.620 --> 58:49.980]  JADAM there's recommended dosages that start on a really diluted end and work
[58:49.980 --> 58:57.060]  their way to a concentrated end I did burn some plants this spring which ended
[58:57.060 --> 59:00.740]  up being a really cool test because I found some strains that really handled
[59:00.740 --> 59:06.340]  it but I sprayed some very powerful JLFs which is a JADAM liquid fertilizer
[59:06.340 --> 59:10.140]  so we're made out of comfrey and a cannabis veg one made out of you know
[59:10.140 --> 59:15.260]  vegging greens you know leafy green shoots and sprayed some smaller plants
[59:15.260 --> 59:18.980]  at a 30 to 1 dosage which is what I would normally spray my bigger plants
[59:18.980 --> 59:24.020]  with and some of those plants you know it's it's a concentration of growth
[59:24.020 --> 59:28.660]  hormones it didn't burn them it caused extreme mutant growth from the very tips
[59:28.660 --> 59:33.580]  and tops of those plants stunted them started throwing three three petioles
[59:33.580 --> 59:40.260]  like it got weird really weird and some plants were not affected by it which was
[59:40.260 --> 59:44.740]  really cool to see some strains were resistant to it and handled it just fine
[59:44.740 --> 59:50.380]  and thrived from it but you know normally those JLFs on a smaller plant
[59:50.380 --> 59:54.780]  like that yeah you should be testing them at a hundred to one you should be
[59:54.780 --> 59:59.660]  testing on one or two plants one little you know tiny area of your garden and
[01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:04.060]  then work your way up to those stronger dilution rates and a bigger plant can
[01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:07.980]  handle those hard those heavier dilution rates and these inputs get better with
[01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:12.020]  time you know year old two year old three year old you need to cut that
[01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:17.940]  dilution rate in half every year every year it ages so if this if I'm using a
[01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:23.500]  cannabis John liquid fertilizer that I made a year ago instead of that 30 to 1
[01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:29.740]  at max dilution I'm doing it at 60 to 1 I'm doing it half a half strength of
[01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:34.900]  what I would normally do and that's the same for the KNF inputs and the
[01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:40.060]  genomic which is my understanding of it and Joey are you always a sprain them or
[01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:49.380]  you root drenching a metal a lot more soil drench that was in the springtime
[01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:55.140]  in my nursery I was doing a lot a little more foliary normally like through most
[01:00:55.140 --> 01:00:58.740]  of the season I'll tell you what my schedule is once a week I'm feeding
[01:00:58.740 --> 01:01:02.820]  biology to the soil once a week I'm either doing my job on microbial
[01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:07.140]  solution we start brewing it on a Wednesday it's usually done on Thursday
[01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:10.940]  or Friday depending on the temperature and we feed it then and the next week
[01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:15.060]  I'm doing a compost tea extract where we're just massaging a bag of a couple
[01:01:15.180 --> 01:01:21.540]  different composts into a bucket of water letting it sit for up to 12 hours
[01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:26.900]  sometimes and then if we're in a hurry we only do it for 10 minutes and then we
[01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:33.460]  dilute that into 50 gallons of water and inoculate our beds with that compost
[01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:38.140]  extract so every week we're adding biology we're doing either the JMS one
[01:01:38.140 --> 01:01:43.420]  week and then the compost the compost extract the next week twice a week I'm
[01:01:43.460 --> 01:01:47.780]  doing my my soil drenches which is usually a mix of Jadon liquid
[01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:51.860]  fertilizers and fermented plant juices or fermented fruit juices this time of
[01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:57.460]  year a lot of over the last month it's been a lot of water-soluble calcium a
[01:01:57.460 --> 01:02:02.820]  lot of the water-soluble phosphorus as we get into this transition time and all
[01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:07.300]  our transition ferments right now which are made out of the unripe fruits
[01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:14.540]  unripe buds tiny unripe cannabis flowers and so yeah in natural farming
[01:02:14.540 --> 01:02:19.300]  we have the nutritive cycle theory which which is that these plants have three
[01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:23.660]  stages in their life veg transition and flowering and we make ferments from
[01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:28.180]  plants in those same stages to feed at those stages so in the springtime we're
[01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:31.940]  making it out of the fast-growing leafy green shoots of the cannabis plant and
[01:02:31.940 --> 01:02:41.020]  the blackberry bush and the nettles and the you know miners lettuce and and in
[01:02:41.020 --> 01:02:47.380]  the fall we're making it right now out of the ripe fruits the apples plums the
[01:02:47.380 --> 01:02:52.100]  zucchini and pumpkins super high phosphorus a lot of my candidates over
[01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:56.460]  the years been zucchini grown and pumpkin grow you know you friends come
[01:02:56.460 --> 01:02:59.620]  over to your house you see those zucchinis in their car you're giving all
[01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:03.340]  your fertility away you know you need to you need to put those back into your
[01:03:03.340 --> 01:03:12.500]  garden so yeah that's kind of how how let me get back to the schedule so once
[01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:18.420]  a week we're feeding our either our compost tea or JMS in that same dilution
[01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:21.900]  tank that we're diluting the compost tea or the or the JMS we're adding our
[01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:26.300]  liquid fertilizers either our KNF inputs or our JMS or our JLF
[01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:31.940]  JLF inputs combination of everything and then we also do another feeding
[01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:35.060]  earlier in the week that's just those fertilizers so twice a week we're doing
[01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:39.500]  a soil drench one of those soil drenches has our microbial inoculate in it and
[01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:45.700]  then if we're on it twice a week we're also doing a folder spray with those
[01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:51.300]  liquid fertilizers and those and some of that inoculate as well. Yes similar I just I
[01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:56.820]  do a bi-weekly inoculation but yeah that that's about a part what I'm doing
[01:03:56.820 --> 01:04:02.260]  on my side except for I don't folder anything. Oh never. I just sulfur and
[01:04:02.260 --> 01:04:10.860]  veg but I try not to I don't know I feel weird spraying my plants down. Marco what
[01:04:10.860 --> 01:04:16.260]  is that that you showed I think it's an EC meter that you've used to put into
[01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:22.580]  your your liquid fertilizers. Yeah I just um I use like a old blue lab
[01:04:22.580 --> 01:04:30.700]  truncheon just solid classic hydroponic kind of instrument and what I use that
[01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:36.140]  for is mainly just to tell me a range of where I'm at you know it detects
[01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:40.520]  you know dissolve solids just like you would in any nutrient you know solution
[01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:45.820]  and then it just kind of tells me you know if I dilute this JLF at 1 to 30
[01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:51.660]  oh that's you know 500 ppm it just gives there we go that's the one I use and
[01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:55.660]  it's some solid state so there's no clicking or buttons or anything to get
[01:04:55.660 --> 01:04:59.220]  messed up and I've had that thing for probably eight years and just works
[01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:04.620]  wonderful. Do you feel like it gives you a good guess on the strength of the
[01:05:04.620 --> 01:05:09.100]  solution? Yeah like I said I've used it for I mean they're they're a quality
[01:05:09.100 --> 01:05:14.820]  product so I mean I haven't gone back behind them but the whole point is with
[01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:19.900]  you know natural farming is I'm not so much concerned on these exact numbers of
[01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:24.820]  what that instrument says it is I'm more concerned that I know that that dilution
[01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:28.860]  is in certain range and I know if these numbers on this instrument get too high
[01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:33.700]  that's a dilution that's that could burn my plants or be too much for them so I
[01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:38.700]  kind of just use that as kind of a you know a guide you know to test my strength.
[01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:42.780]  Well I did the same thing with a with pH in my firm well not well throwing a pH
[01:05:42.780 --> 01:05:46.620]  in my firm it's just to check to see where they're at health-wise with the
[01:05:46.620 --> 01:05:52.060]  ferment so I find that similar I usually try to be around like 3.5 4.5 in that
[01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:56.660]  range. Okay yeah I check my vinegars pH of my vinegars I love them getting nice
[01:05:56.660 --> 01:06:01.180]  and low I know I got a good strong vinegar and things like that. What's a
[01:06:01.180 --> 01:06:04.020]  good vinegar pH for you that you're like all right I'm on the money? I like to be
[01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:08.220]  below 3 you know when I'm making them and then obviously when I'm
[01:06:08.220 --> 01:06:12.340]  using them using them we know I dilute them. I guess that's why they say if
[01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:17.300]  your ferment goes vinegar it's it's dead more on the dead side. I've heard that
[01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:21.340]  I don't know if you've heard that. Well vinegar has is made with acidic acid
[01:06:21.340 --> 01:06:24.700]  bacteria so it's not going to be dead it's just going to have a different
[01:06:24.700 --> 01:06:30.580]  growth of correct if it goes to vinegar now it's more acidic acid bacteria if
[01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:36.420]  it's you know bacillus and it that then to me I found that ferments will go
[01:06:36.420 --> 01:06:41.980]  vinegar just over time you know that's kind of when I get that issue with that
[01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:46.620]  I like vinegar so if something goes vinegar you're like awesome yeah I'm
[01:06:46.620 --> 01:06:51.860]  drinking it yes what's your favorite thing to make vinegar out of I love
[01:06:51.860 --> 01:06:58.220]  persimmon my neighbor has a huge persimmon tree that kind of but it drops
[01:06:58.220 --> 01:07:03.260]  the fruit in the street in the sidewalk kind of on our side street so every fall
[01:07:03.260 --> 01:07:08.020]  I'm out there like early morning before people go to work yeah collecting the
[01:07:08.020 --> 01:07:11.740]  persimmons and I throw them in the freezer and then every day I collect a
[01:07:11.740 --> 01:07:17.020]  few a few a few by the end of the season I make like 20 gallons of my seasonal
[01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:21.140]  persimmon vinegar which a lot of my friends and family come to look forward
[01:07:21.140 --> 01:07:27.180]  to that's awesome but yeah about the firm it's what I've noticed is a what I
[01:07:27.180 --> 01:07:32.260]  like fermenting a lot of my stuff with is papaya because of the peppy I try to
[01:07:32.260 --> 01:07:36.020]  get like a really unripe papaya like I'll shake it make sure I don't fill
[01:07:36.020 --> 01:07:40.660]  any seeds in it and I feel like that gets for at least my cannabis specific
[01:07:40.660 --> 01:07:46.740]  ferments they get I get a more thorough ferment on it yeah in on my research
[01:07:46.740 --> 01:07:51.340]  side of things what I school man yeah the thing is that what you do and what
[01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:56.300]  everyone does is it seems like it's just a progression or a different branch of
[01:07:56.300 --> 01:08:01.140]  to me natural farming like a lot of these things to me and Joey you can
[01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:06.260]  chime in as well every we don't know everything you know what I mean like
[01:08:06.260 --> 01:08:12.220]  things can be discovered today tomorrow anytime in the future and with trying
[01:08:12.220 --> 01:08:16.860]  new things you discover hey this works and sometimes you discover this does not
[01:08:16.860 --> 01:08:22.460]  work so I'm all about trying things I love the experimentation and if and the
[01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:26.500]  plants are most likely gonna be what tells you if it works correct and I find
[01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:29.900]  out that a lot of these are indigenous techniques that are we're rediscovering
[01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:36.780]  if anything a lot of the times true definitely this is not new growing food
[01:08:36.780 --> 01:08:40.580]  definitely is not new and they've been doing it for way longer than we've been
[01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:48.420]  putting poison and chemicals out you know on our technology to this definitely
[01:08:48.420 --> 01:08:51.540]  yeah I know a Morrison house but we're doing another greenhouse I want to get
[01:08:51.540 --> 01:08:56.580]  some of those horizon beds I got I just set up some grassroots some three feet
[01:08:56.580 --> 01:08:59.780]  wide by three foot long you know I'm doing like it's like 18 inches high with
[01:08:59.780 --> 01:09:02.740]  like 14 inches of soil and we're setting them up I was like dang I need
[01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:08.300]  to give a give a ring your way for our next setup dude I have I'm working with
[01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:12.940]  all the soil blenders up here now so I can truck a horizons like a bag it ship
[01:09:12.940 --> 01:09:18.620]  it you know to people that are desperate I got hit up from Alaska I got hit up
[01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:23.460]  from Michigan and I was like mixing you know just silt and clay at the right
[01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:35.180]  ratio and putting them in boxes or bring it to the fucking UPS I could go
[01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:40.920]  to 80 but I'm trying to be nice to you people yeah no we need to piss off some
[01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:44.620]  delivery people and you need to send some my way
[01:09:45.620 --> 01:09:53.620]  can you talk about I love listening to talk about small horizons can you talk
[01:09:53.620 --> 01:09:58.500]  about building those in a Google and and would you do that any differently you
[01:09:58.500 --> 01:10:02.140]  know if you have all that wood in there you know can you talk about that a
[01:10:02.140 --> 01:10:09.360]  little bit yeah yeah I mean Hugo or Hugo's designed to hold water and the
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:14.220]  horizontal system is designed to move water so it's a little different of a
[01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:19.940]  perspective of how you would do it originally when I first introduced the
[01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:24.780]  horizontal soil system in Portland the canvas community just laughed at me
[01:10:24.780 --> 01:10:32.660]  like what the fuck right and I'm like dude I'm a soil fucking engineer I know
[01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:36.820]  what I'm talking and you guys your biggest problem you over water
[01:10:36.820 --> 01:10:41.940]  everything so I'm like here's a system that you guys can use when you over
[01:10:41.940 --> 01:10:47.100]  water it will store at the bottom and then as it dries out it will wick back
[01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:53.940]  up and keep a better moisture profile in the whole system plus you guys without
[01:10:53.940 --> 01:10:59.060]  fucking sand and clay and silt you're limiting the ability of this cannabis
[01:10:59.060 --> 01:11:03.300]  plant to actually show its full expression you need those materials so
[01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:08.540]  the biology can provide those minerals and trace nutrients and all of that shit
[01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:11.900]  that you're not getting in your soilless medium so those medium works
[01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:17.900]  great with bottled nudes but as Marco would say bottles are for fucking babies
[01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:25.220]  that's why I use humic because humic has lots of trace minerals in it right but again so
[01:11:25.220 --> 01:11:29.740]  you know the beauty of that system is that it mitigates over watering it
[01:11:29.740 --> 01:11:35.180]  stores it in the horizon similar to Hugo but it's a different principle and so
[01:11:35.300 --> 01:11:41.260]  yeah it was it was it was designed to make things easier for transitions from
[01:11:41.260 --> 01:11:46.380]  bottled nutrients into a living soil system for people because if you try to
[01:11:46.380 --> 01:11:50.660]  do a living soil system in just a soilless medium you're fucked you're not
[01:11:50.660 --> 01:11:55.340]  you're gonna have to pound it with biology all the time to get anything
[01:11:55.340 --> 01:11:59.580]  old and you're still limited on the available nutrients and minerals that
[01:11:59.580 --> 01:12:04.700]  that are stored in plant material you know that one thing I did Leighton is on
[01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:12.260]  your horizontal soil I am so on top of my e horizon where the e and the a meet
[01:12:12.260 --> 01:12:21.580]  I did like young Ramal ginkgo wood and my thought process was that okay we're
[01:12:21.580 --> 01:12:26.620]  making this sand filter so to me the top of that sand filter is gonna be a
[01:12:26.620 --> 01:12:30.980]  collection zone of all this organic material that's gonna be leaching down
[01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:36.180]  through our system so I said well why not add a little bit of wood in there
[01:12:36.180 --> 01:12:39.820]  because it's already gonna start cranking up with this a lot of this
[01:12:39.820 --> 01:12:45.140]  biology and I felt like hopefully that gives me some nice longer-term nutrient
[01:12:45.140 --> 01:12:49.780]  cycling down at that horizon level right above the sand filter love it dude
[01:12:49.780 --> 01:12:53.180]  absolutely love it and you're spot-on you're right that's where it's gonna end
[01:12:53.180 --> 01:12:57.620]  up and the people that have asked me about like how to blend a hugel system
[01:12:57.620 --> 01:13:03.260]  with the horizontal system I usually tell him hey do your do your e do your a
[01:13:03.260 --> 01:13:08.020]  and then put your logs in at the bottom of your Oh but you could go to the
[01:13:08.020 --> 01:13:12.580]  bottom of the a2 it doesn't it doesn't really matter I mean shango just did a
[01:13:12.580 --> 01:13:18.260]  like an a study on it on his on his platform and he goes latent by the end
[01:13:18.260 --> 01:13:23.620]  of the first year I really couldn't find that definitive line between the a and
[01:13:23.620 --> 01:13:28.300]  I'm like you're not supposed to do perfect you're breaking down you're
[01:13:28.300 --> 01:13:32.860]  building a functioning system that is working as a whole not as individual
[01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:38.660]  layers so yeah mark above what you don't do that's that's great idea and highly
[01:13:38.660 --> 01:13:42.540]  suggested but again you don't want to fuck up with your e because your e has
[01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:47.300]  to be a sand filter that's the fines that the organic matter from getting
[01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:51.780]  down into that aquifer because if they do they're gonna go anaerobic and you're
[01:13:52.620 --> 01:13:56.660]  so saying that when you're running ferments would you advise running
[01:13:56.660 --> 01:14:00.500]  ferments in a system like that or how would you go about that sure ferments
[01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:05.180]  are great I mean ferments are secondary and tertiary metabolites they're all the
[01:14:05.180 --> 01:14:08.420]  things that their hormones they're they're think they're baby food they're
[01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:13.060]  easy for the plant to take up because you've done the work for them so no it
[01:14:13.060 --> 01:14:18.060]  ferments work in that system just fine whether it's foliar or drench doesn't
[01:14:18.060 --> 01:14:26.580]  really matter I agree yeah awesome yeah I gotta I gotta I gotta check that out
[01:14:26.580 --> 01:14:30.780]  because I really see all the love come from that side that you're doing and I
[01:14:30.780 --> 01:14:36.220]  really want some of that into my garden because man that's it just makes so much
[01:14:36.220 --> 01:14:39.100]  sense it sits well in the head and when you think about it more and more it's
[01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:46.740]  just a no-brainer especially whether like a four by four I mean that's the
[01:14:46.740 --> 01:14:50.380]  best thing you can do like a little four by four tent and do a horizontal
[01:14:50.380 --> 01:14:54.620]  soil and like a grass roots pot I mean for the you know the home grower that's
[01:14:54.620 --> 01:14:59.660]  a that's a you'll have that thing for years you know 10 years 20 years even
[01:14:59.660 --> 01:15:08.020]  seriously just make sure you don't have to move yeah definitely so that's what
[01:15:08.020 --> 01:15:11.700]  I'm trying to do I'm actually trying to get to a place where I have a property
[01:15:11.700 --> 01:15:16.940]  because a lot of a lot of my you know my thing into the ferment is I live in
[01:15:16.940 --> 01:15:20.980]  Los Angeles it's a concrete jungle my backyard is as big as this hotel room
[01:15:20.980 --> 01:15:25.060]  that we're in practically so I go about it in a way that some people trip out on
[01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:28.380]  it but it's because I'm in a concrete jungle and I'm not afforded to a lot of
[01:15:28.380 --> 01:15:32.660]  these permaculture ways and whatnot so I've attacked it in the way that I have
[01:15:32.660 --> 01:15:35.620]  but I'm definitely gonna be put myself in a position where I could take
[01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:38.780]  advantage of a lot of these techniques that I see you guys you know
[01:15:38.780 --> 01:15:44.220]  implementing with would not with with grit with what ease to but with just it
[01:15:44.220 --> 01:15:48.380]  just feels like that lifestyle you get a lot you know there's a lifestyle out of
[01:15:48.380 --> 01:15:52.820]  it and it just I want that love in my life yeah there's love in there man I'm
[01:15:52.820 --> 01:15:57.860]  gonna tell you like like the I look at my soil more than my plants really like
[01:15:57.860 --> 01:16:02.940]  I'm like when I water I don't just look at the plants I'm down there looking at
[01:16:02.940 --> 01:16:08.760]  my cover my companion crop seeing what worms came up I supply springtails I
[01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:13.960]  mean there's a whole community in that soil and it is love man once you once it
[01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:19.120]  gets in you that's what you look for because I know when that is healthy the
[01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:23.440]  plants are gonna be healthy so that you know that kind of takes actually the
[01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:27.680]  pressure off of it you know you're not so focused on the plant you focus on the
[01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:31.500]  soil and the soil for the most part does all the work as long as you put the
[01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:37.480]  right ingredient into it yeah it's a jungle in that soil but it's jungle love
[01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:46.360]  I need some jungle love now it's cool to see what I was checking out your
[01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:50.260]  Instagram Joey and it's absolutely I love how you guys like break down the
[01:16:50.260 --> 01:16:54.840]  land and the way that you do it makes it exciting to actually have land when you
[01:16:54.840 --> 01:16:59.360]  see it like that and it's not just a empty plot so to speak so it's cool it
[01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:04.840]  gives it makes those gears turn yeah you know there is a huge difference between
[01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:11.320]  the suburbia the concrete jungle and fucking hardwood sanctuary man it's just
[01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:15.880]  you know those are the extreme ends and you know we all have to do this work to
[01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:20.400]  bring those to the middle you know to bring the beautiful hardwood sanctuary
[01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:25.840]  to that concrete jungle to suburbia and do whatever possible we can you know I
[01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:30.560]  talked about it like an Eden bomb right like so I convinced this client to allow
[01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:34.760]  me to treat their land and now all of a sudden they've beneficials come back the
[01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:38.320]  birds are hanging out the butterflies are doing their shit the plants all look
[01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:42.560]  much more healthy they're attracting you know other attention from the neighbors
[01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:47.040]  now that now the neighbors say hey what are you doing why is your shit so good
[01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:51.520]  and they want it and then that just spreads and spreads and spreads and
[01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:56.920]  that's what we're up against at this point you know as if we don't do that if
[01:17:56.920 --> 01:18:01.320]  we don't start getting some footholds using what we've learned and our voices
[01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:06.760]  to explain how to do it we're you know blissfully skipping into oblivion as a
[01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:11.880]  species and and that's got to try to prevent that I mean we all got children
[01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:16.760]  loved ones that we want to support and make sure they're alright so we got to
[01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:20.920]  be eco warriors man and get the word out and do this kind of shit so no you're
[01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:25.200]  at you're absolutely right I was I taught this one individual how to make
[01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:28.760]  some you know some of his own inputs and he was applying it to his lawn and
[01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:32.600]  he had like he was to tell me he'd like my lawns better than the golf course and
[01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:35.800]  he said his wife would be backing out of his driveway and the neighbors would
[01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:41.880]  stop him like dude what are you guys putting on your lawn yes you're
[01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:45.440]  absolutely right about that it starts the conversation that others could
[01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:52.560]  visibly see yeah you're my favorite all-time Star Trek's was the Genesis
[01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:57.840]  project where they launched a rocket onto this moon and that rocket just
[01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:02.160]  starts growing things and the planet just just becomes an instant jungle well
[01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:06.560]  there's a hitch to it they didn't think it all the way through and it collapsed
[01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:10.560]  and then now they want to use that as a weapon to you know blow you know a
[01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:16.440]  colonized yeah I didn't let it start over again so but it the idea of setting
[01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:20.680]  off an Eden bomb and then letting that expand out was always something that I
[01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:25.320]  thought would be you know a beautiful way to get other people to start you
[01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:29.480]  know really taking care of their property naturally to encourage that
[01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:33.640]  thought on Florida come back the indigenous leading by example you know
[01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:38.320]  if I can do it in my property you can do it you know here are the ways I do it
[01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:43.120]  you see me doing it right and then and giving them that knowledge so they can
[01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:48.000]  do it at home and they fire that fucking you know chem truck chem lawn is coming
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:52.560]  by because now they're saving money you know and so you know these are all
[01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:58.160]  little steps that we can do and you know and trying to greenify what's what's
[01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:04.120]  left of our our planet at this point you know I feel the same way saving money is
[01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:07.280]  the big thing especially right now because the uncertainties that we face
[01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:12.680]  in the world right now anything that we could help put into our war chest to so
[01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:17.840]  to speak to help you know our family or people around us it I will take it
[01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:23.000]  that's how I see it sign me up yeah like my one of my favorite sayings is you
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:26.880]  can't get ready you have to already be ready you know favors are prepared when
[01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:35.680]  you're hungry that's not time to learn how to grow food you know I feel like
[01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:41.200]  you know shows like this like don't just take this and I trust me don't just take
[01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:46.000]  this for cannabis grow every plant like a lot of people hit me up does this work
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:52.640]  for can of course it does because it works for every plant you know so so so
[01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:57.000]  grow more than just one plant is what I'm saying you know if you do grow
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:01.360]  cannabis also grow garden you know those kind of things will help you because now
[01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:05.840]  you're getting more organic material that you can add to your your cannabis
[01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:11.480]  garden a lot of people say well I tried to make a you know FPJ out of fan leaves
[01:21:11.480 --> 01:21:15.720]  and I didn't hardly get anything you know and and you don't a lot from a
[01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:18.920]  family because there's not I mean there's things in it but you don't get a
[01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:23.480]  lot you'd be better off making a jail left bucket and then now you get
[01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:27.560]  everything out of that cannabis leaf and then if you also grow tomatoes now you
[01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:33.800]  do a jail effort tomatoes so even on small scale if you have an apartment and
[01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:37.640]  you have a balcony you can probably slide a little jail left bucket out
[01:21:37.640 --> 01:21:41.560]  there or even a jar just to give you a little bit of inputs it's a little bit
[01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:45.760]  of you know natural one less thing you gotta buy that's kind of what the way I
[01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:49.760]  look at it beautiful way of putting it brother beautiful way of putting it and
[01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:53.920]  you know to the people out there that has like this little patch of grass
[01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:59.560]  right it doesn't have to be grass it could be anything and if you start using
[01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:05.920]  the local indigenous plants to you know get you know pockets or flushes I like
[01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:10.960]  to call them install some mycorrhizae in you know get some good compost with some
[01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:15.960]  good saprophytic fungi and start to build that soil up and eventually you
[01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:21.360]  don't have to water and if you do water and you're out here in a very dry area
[01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:26.280]  sub irrigation man you've got to use drip I mean I work it on this farm they
[01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:30.480]  they use these sprinkles like I'm like what the fuck what are you guys thinking
[01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:36.520]  it has to go here before it even gets to the ground yeah so we did this project
[01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:42.480]  on this orchard the lemons we've saved 70% of the water that they used to use
[01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:49.440]  and the avocados 58% less water just by sub irrigating putting down compost and
[01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:54.520]  chips to hold that moisture in and the fucking trees are going ballistic so you
[01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:57.960]  can do that home anybody can do this and I don't care if you got like a
[01:22:57.960 --> 01:23:03.440]  little 4x4 piece of soil that you've got some plants in just work it man get it
[01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:06.840]  get it functioning and then your neighbors are gonna say well wow what
[01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:09.880]  do you do and let's let's work together and show me how to do it and that's
[01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:17.080]  where the love starts and spreads like wildfire yeah yeah yeah definitely I feel
[01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:22.600]  like a lot of the cool things that we could get ourselves into when it comes
[01:23:22.600 --> 01:23:26.040]  to like soil health and all that they're just mind expanding in the way
[01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:31.720]  where you want to help like look at us here we've been been inspired ourselves
[01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:37.360]  this is disinfection so to speak to just throw out into the into the ether so I
[01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:45.760]  definitely concur with that I'm sorry bro we spun that off all good you guys
[01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:51.240]  keep spinning it I'm gonna duck out and take a leak real back real quick
[01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:59.600]  oh you're some more your input brother right are you hearing feedback on us no
[01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:10.740]  these guys are sounding good now test hope you mean hopefully Joey didn't
[01:24:10.740 --> 01:24:15.580]  bring his mic to the bathroom with him oh you think that was happened no no I'm
[01:24:15.580 --> 01:24:24.220]  joking I'm joking oh he's muted okay he still had his Bluetooth connected for
[01:24:24.220 --> 01:24:35.380]  the audio we'd be we'd be listening to Joey Oh mic'd up in the bathroom
[01:24:35.380 --> 01:24:41.820]  that's not cool thank you for dropping that that instrument I mean I've told so
[01:24:41.820 --> 01:24:46.540]  many people to go and find that on your website because you know that whole
[01:24:46.540 --> 01:24:51.100]  moron thing like they don't understand how powerful these fucking fertilizers
[01:24:51.100 --> 01:24:55.900]  are oh I know yeah right you think just because it's a bucket of water and plan
[01:24:55.900 --> 01:24:59.820]  and microbe just not powerful but yeah it's very powerful like Joey said he's
[01:24:59.820 --> 01:25:04.960]  got plants morphing morphing out on them you know what I mean like but like he
[01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:08.860]  also said when he found those plants that were tolerant to it now you got
[01:25:08.860 --> 01:25:13.620]  some probably some really great plants right there you know great juice to them
[01:25:13.620 --> 01:25:20.020]  yeah well yeah I'm loving the horizontal soil late and I mean I that thing really
[01:25:20.020 --> 01:25:24.980]  just turned you know it can't be looking at soil in a different way for indoors
[01:25:24.980 --> 01:25:30.380]  I mean I think it's awesome yeah it is it is a great way to you know again make
[01:25:30.380 --> 01:25:35.140]  that transition from you know synthetic fertilizers into a living soil system
[01:25:35.140 --> 01:25:40.780]  and providing all of the key elements so that you can do it easily and not end
[01:25:40.780 --> 01:25:44.500]  up fighting it because I mean I heard so many horror stories of people saying you
[01:25:44.500 --> 01:25:48.460]  know I used to be able to grow great and I can't anymore and it's like well what
[01:25:48.460 --> 01:25:53.260]  are you doing you know why and while trying to do this living soil anyway
[01:25:53.260 --> 01:25:57.820]  you know that's what it's there for is to help people make that transition away
[01:25:57.820 --> 01:26:05.020]  from and Joey welcome back brother let's let's let's get you rounded
[01:26:05.020 --> 01:26:11.220]  in here so you originally asked like how would a hugel and and a horizontal work
[01:26:11.220 --> 01:26:17.620]  together and I think you know that in many ways the key to again to dealing
[01:26:17.620 --> 01:26:23.220]  with excess water is is to make sure that you don't create a swamp and it
[01:26:23.220 --> 01:26:29.540]  goes anaerobic so I would say that you know blending in a in a hugel situation
[01:26:29.540 --> 01:26:34.020]  especially in NorCal we guys have that really heavy clay that doesn't drain
[01:26:34.140 --> 01:26:38.820]  well that you'd have to be careful and make sure that that hugel if you're
[01:26:38.820 --> 01:26:44.460]  gonna blend clay and silt and sand in that you are you know up leaning heavily
[01:26:44.460 --> 01:26:51.060]  on the sand side maybe go to 60% or 65% and then take that around the logs and
[01:26:51.060 --> 01:26:57.540]  then let the somehow make sure that that hugel has a pitch and a way for excess
[01:26:57.540 --> 01:27:02.900]  water to either wick out or leach out one of the other and this that goes back
[01:27:02.900 --> 01:27:07.500]  into you know like digging holes man I tell every client anybody that hits me
[01:27:07.500 --> 01:27:11.500]  up go dig a hole man did dig as deep as you possibly can take a picture and let's
[01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:14.460]  look at what you got and then when you're at the bottom of that hole pour
[01:27:14.460 --> 01:27:20.060]  some water we're in five gallons see how long it takes for that to percolate or
[01:27:20.060 --> 01:27:24.580]  leach out into the soil huge indicators to whether you're going to have to
[01:27:24.580 --> 01:27:28.860]  build on top of the soil or whether you can build in the soil and then I'll see
[01:27:28.860 --> 01:27:32.780]  how to do that on the surface so don't only do a deep perk but do what's called
[01:27:32.780 --> 01:27:37.500]  an infiltration test on the surface to see how long that takes that water to
[01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:41.700]  get in there and if it takes a long time to get in there now you got to start
[01:27:41.700 --> 01:27:46.940]  building swales and berms and retention areas because like you know the dude
[01:27:46.940 --> 01:27:51.980]  from New Mexico man they yeah they get four months of rain and then it's gone
[01:27:51.980 --> 01:27:55.660]  for nine months and if you don't have a way to store and hold it you're in
[01:27:55.660 --> 01:28:01.100]  trouble man so that would be you know that would be my suggestion
[01:28:02.980 --> 01:28:07.940]  no you're absolutely right we have this terrible clay soil out here a native
[01:28:07.940 --> 01:28:15.540]  soil here in Humboldt and it doesn't drain and it's very anaerobic and so
[01:28:15.540 --> 01:28:19.420]  yeah a lot of times we do build these hooghles at ground level on top of these
[01:28:19.420 --> 01:28:23.300]  we don't want to excavate that because we'll dig these trenches to lay logs in
[01:28:23.300 --> 01:28:29.340]  and yeah you put some water in there and it turns into a little pool so yeah
[01:28:29.340 --> 01:28:32.740]  there are definitely times when we build them on the ground where we want
[01:28:32.740 --> 01:28:35.260]  to make sure we're gonna have that drainage and we don't really want to
[01:28:35.260 --> 01:28:38.340]  generate all this topsoil to throw on top of that hooghle that's just all this
[01:28:38.340 --> 01:28:45.840]  heavy clay so yeah thank you for that Leighton 60% sand probably be really
[01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:51.220]  helpful smearation and drainage and everything yep
[01:28:51.580 --> 01:28:57.580]  mother nature's badass you just gotta follow her just follow her lead
[01:29:04.580 --> 01:29:09.780]  a little chili verde and a little this 840 by Ringo's gift the 840 is actually
[01:29:09.780 --> 01:29:14.780]  Josh and Kelly's strains and the Ringo's is something that tomorrow's been
[01:29:14.780 --> 01:29:20.660]  working with for a long time at Heal Thyself Gardens high CBD it's that time
[01:29:20.660 --> 01:29:23.860]  of year where you're so sick of smoking your strain that you've been smoking for
[01:29:23.860 --> 01:29:28.460]  the last eight months you start mixing together trying to get trying to say is
[01:29:28.460 --> 01:29:37.260]  the chip is the chili verde from Eric HBK yes that is HBK's emerald cup
[01:29:37.260 --> 01:29:41.940]  blending strain which I'm a big fan of the strain and the person good buddy of
[01:29:41.940 --> 01:29:46.620]  mine really enjoy smoking it this is a really cheesy phenol we actually call
[01:29:46.620 --> 01:29:53.700]  this the chili cheese verde and I love it cheese fan stuff oh yeah what do you
[01:29:53.700 --> 01:30:03.300]  got there yeah is that all HBK here that's a lot of HBK genetics right there
[01:30:03.300 --> 01:30:11.620]  mmm showing off yeah I grew I used to grow a lot of the green candy jack as
[01:30:11.620 --> 01:30:16.380]  one of his and that was an incredible strain not real stable you'd get some
[01:30:16.380 --> 01:30:20.460]  short ones and some tall ones but they're all amazing there wasn't really
[01:30:20.460 --> 01:30:26.980]  any losers in the batch yeah he's awesome yeah but definitely smoking
[01:30:26.980 --> 01:30:31.020]  eight-month-old weed right now and it's all good some of it's just now getting
[01:30:31.020 --> 01:30:37.820]  really good did you do any death work this year Joey no grew some auto flowers
[01:30:37.820 --> 01:30:43.980]  a few different auto flowers four or five different wines from Heart Rock
[01:30:43.980 --> 01:30:48.460]  Mountain Farm and that was fun you know the ones I don't mess up turn out really
[01:30:48.460 --> 01:30:54.260]  nice I like growing some auto flowers I did this the year before also because
[01:30:54.260 --> 01:30:58.660]  then I've got some plants early in the year I can make some ferments out of I
[01:30:58.660 --> 01:31:02.180]  can make a transition ferment that can make a flower ferment early in the year
[01:31:02.180 --> 01:31:06.460]  to have ready for my cold turns so that worked out really well because I messed
[01:31:06.460 --> 01:31:10.180]  a bunch of these autos up last year also was my first time growing them last year
[01:31:10.180 --> 01:31:17.020]  and I fertilized them too much I watered them too much this year I really
[01:31:17.020 --> 01:31:28.740]  tried to neglect them I used the secret was yeah well feed them I you neglect
[01:31:28.740 --> 01:31:34.900]  the fuck out of them and they grow great I used the mark Shepherd technique the
[01:31:35.220 --> 01:31:42.660]  technique that's the strategic total utter neglect and the ones that did good
[01:31:42.660 --> 01:31:48.300]  did really good did you plant them in the ground or in pots I actually started
[01:31:48.300 --> 01:31:52.540]  them in soil blocks use the soil blockers with some homemade soil mix and
[01:31:52.540 --> 01:31:58.660]  start started them in the two-inch some went from two inch directly into the
[01:31:58.660 --> 01:32:01.780]  ground and they didn't like that it was a little too early or a little too old
[01:32:01.940 --> 01:32:05.900]  the weather was so up and down this spring would go from really cold really
[01:32:05.900 --> 01:32:14.180]  hot it was a struggle with everything we put out with all of our timing so yeah
[01:32:14.180 --> 01:32:17.540]  some went into four inch soil blocks from those two inch and stayed in the
[01:32:17.540 --> 01:32:20.980]  greenhouse longer and those ones did better they got to grow in the warm
[01:32:20.980 --> 01:32:27.020]  conditions I got to go out a little later and yeah it's still a lot more to
[01:32:27.020 --> 01:32:30.340]  learn about these autos that you know it seems they really don't like to be
[01:32:30.340 --> 01:32:35.860]  transplanted that's why I might be a little better for a little easier for I
[01:32:35.860 --> 01:32:40.060]  don't know I think that route that air pruning of the roots might immediately
[01:32:40.060 --> 01:32:43.740]  want to kick them in the well the whole thing the whole thing with them is they
[01:32:43.740 --> 01:32:47.420]  don't like root resistance as soon as they feel like a root resistance they
[01:32:47.420 --> 01:32:52.220]  start to trip and then they'll it'll kick them into flowering I've even done
[01:32:52.220 --> 01:32:57.460]  it where I like to start all my in like the paper towel method and whatnot like
[01:32:57.460 --> 01:33:00.860]  soak it in a paper towel if I leave them too long in that paper towel and
[01:33:00.860 --> 01:33:06.140]  they get just pissed so to speak and I throw them in in like 20 days they'll
[01:33:06.140 --> 01:33:10.420]  start flowering and I'm like no there's this little baby you know what I mean
[01:33:10.420 --> 01:33:13.500]  but yeah any type of root resistance they don't like it so you want something
[01:33:13.500 --> 01:33:18.980]  that's a really aerated soil they like to just flow through it but as soon as
[01:33:18.980 --> 01:33:22.140]  they feel any type of stressors in the root zone or they start hitting
[01:33:22.140 --> 01:33:27.060]  sidewalls and they just start to it starts to trigger them sooner normally
[01:33:27.060 --> 01:33:31.460]  they'll they'll start to sex like within like 30 days you want it to you
[01:33:31.460 --> 01:33:34.060]  know what I mean you want it that's a good point your out of flowers gonna be
[01:33:34.060 --> 01:33:39.900]  a nice size but sometimes they'll sex like in 12 days and then from stressors
[01:33:39.900 --> 01:33:43.540]  but yeah definitely I grow a lot of a lot of auto flowers I breed some auto
[01:33:43.540 --> 01:33:48.340]  flowers too but not all there's a lot of auto flowers out there that that just
[01:33:48.340 --> 01:33:52.180]  suck big-time they need a lot there's a lot of work that has to be done there
[01:33:52.180 --> 01:33:55.940]  are a lot of people that are doing a lot of work like Mephisto night owl now
[01:33:56.100 --> 01:34:01.460]  gnome automatics a formerly Mandalorian really you know really good auto flowers
[01:34:01.460 --> 01:34:10.100]  you got on real Thor with his ham Thor's hammer f4 super super good stuff but
[01:34:10.100 --> 01:34:13.380]  yeah there's I think the ones that you were growing what was the name of the
[01:34:13.380 --> 01:34:19.460]  auto flower they came from heart rock mountain farm pride of the lion seeds as
[01:34:19.460 --> 01:34:22.460]  their seed company oh yeah definitely I know the other day good auto flowers
[01:34:22.780 --> 01:34:28.580]  lion claw is really their big one line clause I grew that mostly mostly just
[01:34:28.580 --> 01:34:34.300]  line for last year we had four or five isn't that essential they run under
[01:34:34.300 --> 01:34:39.820]  essential genetics I think line claw there there are there a dragonfly
[01:34:39.820 --> 01:34:50.300]  earth medicine DEM certified farm in medicine out here I see yeah I think I
[01:34:51.020 --> 01:34:54.380]  might be under another name as well I swear I've seen lion claw under essential
[01:34:54.380 --> 01:35:02.540]  genetics unless they're still in their work possibly yeah no I like a lot yeah
[01:35:02.540 --> 01:35:07.180]  it's not it goes about 90 to 110 days and I was trying to get everything out
[01:35:07.180 --> 01:35:11.740]  before mid-june when all my you know what I thought my full term should be
[01:35:11.740 --> 01:35:16.380]  going in those same beds so I was kind of a race to try to get stuff in early
[01:35:16.820 --> 01:35:23.180]  yeah yeah trying to get them out because last year what happened was I planted
[01:35:23.180 --> 01:35:27.740]  them both in the same bed at the same time and then fed my regular veg
[01:35:27.740 --> 01:35:33.060]  regimen through my drip system so they got all this edge I hear you know
[01:35:33.060 --> 01:35:37.140]  apparently don't they don't even want any any flowering you know really they
[01:35:37.140 --> 01:35:42.020]  really just don't much want much of anything what I've heard but you know
[01:35:42.020 --> 01:35:46.980]  they used to growing up out of the crack in the sidewalk you know yeah
[01:35:46.980 --> 01:35:51.060]  another super hardy plants that was really I really didn't feed them much at
[01:35:51.060 --> 01:35:55.420]  all they got they got JMS I was feeding the soil around them but I was really
[01:35:55.420 --> 01:35:58.940]  you know making sure when we were doing our feedings early on when they were
[01:35:58.940 --> 01:36:04.420]  still in the ground you were just hand watering and feeding the full terms not
[01:36:04.420 --> 01:36:11.700]  so much hitting the I want to reiterate to the audience is that
[01:36:11.700 --> 01:36:16.860]  any root resistant so if you put them in a little pot and you transplant them
[01:36:16.860 --> 01:36:22.700]  that's stressing them and if that hits something it goes into flower so you
[01:36:22.700 --> 01:36:26.500]  really want to be putting these seeds right into wherever they're going and
[01:36:26.500 --> 01:36:31.740]  don't touch them and don't be absolutely that that's why you'll see a lot of the
[01:36:31.740 --> 01:36:34.660]  guys a lot of flower growers you'll see them with the cup technique where they
[01:36:34.660 --> 01:36:38.740]  put that cup over the top of the soil so it doesn't dry out to allow it to you'll
[01:36:38.740 --> 01:36:41.340]  see a lot of growers do that because they'll put them in their final home and
[01:36:41.380 --> 01:36:43.980]  they'll just put a little humidity dome type situation over them because they're
[01:36:43.980 --> 01:36:49.260]  trying to keep it as relaxed as possible all the way through another great trick
[01:36:49.260 --> 01:36:54.220]  great trick if you're gonna try playing God another reason to make a horizontal
[01:36:54.220 --> 01:36:58.420]  bed too because you know like I said that four by four than any bigger size
[01:36:58.420 --> 01:37:03.620]  less root resistant roots got plenty of room to spread out definitely definitely
[01:37:03.620 --> 01:37:08.140]  so for your auto flowers Joe joy are you gonna how do you see them fitting in
[01:37:08.140 --> 01:37:14.140]  your sphere so to speak your growing sphere oh I think everyone should be
[01:37:14.140 --> 01:37:20.820]  growing more so for there's so many different things we could be using it
[01:37:20.820 --> 01:37:26.220]  for I used to have a medical cannabis doctor that I used to see for my 215
[01:37:26.220 --> 01:37:33.260]  prescriptions for annual 215 days and his name was dr. dr. William Courtney and
[01:37:33.420 --> 01:37:38.780]  he really was popularizing CBD and educating people want CBD back in the
[01:37:38.780 --> 01:37:45.900]  day and juicing especially juicing high CBD cannabis leaf and but he was really
[01:37:45.900 --> 01:37:50.180]  big on juicing but that you you know that we really need these super high
[01:37:50.180 --> 01:37:57.580]  dosages of this THC a and these CB bees it's not activated so it's not gonna get
[01:37:57.580 --> 01:38:02.180]  you high no it's not heated literally just thrown it in the blender or in your
[01:38:02.180 --> 01:38:10.220]  juicer but he was working this was you know 10-15 years ago he was working on
[01:38:10.220 --> 01:38:17.980]  auto flowering feminized CBD strains so with his hope that a person could start
[01:38:17.980 --> 01:38:22.100]  a seed every day and then harvest a plant every day and you would have what
[01:38:22.100 --> 01:38:26.020]  you know you're feminized auto flower you'd have 60 or 70 or 80 of these
[01:38:26.020 --> 01:38:32.140]  whatever it is you start one every day and it would give you it would
[01:38:32.140 --> 01:38:36.300]  give you this source of medicine you know that otherwise you're not going to
[01:38:36.300 --> 01:38:41.380]  go out and be able to afford to go buy that much juice you know you're talking
[01:38:41.380 --> 01:38:46.420]  like you know half ounce to an ounce ideally but this is how they're getting
[01:38:46.420 --> 01:38:55.540]  major dosages of CBD and the folks back in the day this Kevin Jodry about this
[01:38:55.540 --> 01:39:00.740]  because he was doing the juicing back in the day and was tied in with these guys
[01:39:00.740 --> 01:39:06.900]  yeah absolutely they used to do juicing days down at Wonderland nursery and
[01:39:06.900 --> 01:39:11.660]  Kevin was a big part of pushing these CBD genetics in the community they were
[01:39:11.660 --> 01:39:14.980]  they were running full-page ads in the local paper that come on in we'll give
[01:39:14.980 --> 01:39:19.620]  you you know five free CBD clones and if they if you came down there and they had
[01:39:19.620 --> 01:39:23.700]  them you can walk out of there three CBD clones so they were doing some amazing
[01:39:23.700 --> 01:39:26.580]  compassion programs and we're really doing a good job getting the medicine
[01:39:26.580 --> 01:39:32.140]  out this was when Lawrence Ringo had just discovered his CBD strains you know
[01:39:32.140 --> 01:39:42.500]  sour tsunami Ringo's gift so CBD was booming right here around 2010 11 12 and
[01:39:42.500 --> 01:39:48.820]  and a lot of people were getting their medicine getting really good medicine
[01:39:48.820 --> 01:39:55.940]  unfortunately the rec market no this hasn't gotten hip to this yet but you
[01:39:55.940 --> 01:40:00.860]  know other than the these really low-grade CBD products of the selling
[01:40:00.860 --> 01:40:12.580]  gas station seemed to be pretty popular with folks but yeah yeah definitely
[01:40:12.580 --> 01:40:17.220]  juicing is a big important thing my sister's a cancer survivor and juicing
[01:40:17.220 --> 01:40:22.380]  was a big part of her treatment and her recovery and my dad got this huge
[01:40:22.380 --> 01:40:27.740]  industrial juicer and used to bring it down to two cabins at Wonderland and
[01:40:27.740 --> 01:40:33.820]  they would do juice in there and people should do it go and go in your
[01:40:33.820 --> 01:40:37.060]  greenhouse go in your garden give them a good little rent and you know wash them
[01:40:37.060 --> 01:40:40.620]  off and then throw them in your blender throw them in your smoothie don't throw
[01:40:40.620 --> 01:40:44.620]  them in your drink even just a couple of leaves it's gonna have some good
[01:40:44.620 --> 01:40:48.580]  cannabinoids for you it's gonna activate that endocannabinoid system that we all
[01:40:48.580 --> 01:40:57.420]  have in us because we all evolve so closely with this cannabis plant. I always thought that you had to have it heated I didn't know that there was that
[01:40:57.420 --> 01:41:01.100]  benefit of the juicing aspect I like that well that's if you that would
[01:41:01.100 --> 01:41:04.940]  activate all the cannabinoids and then you get the you know psychotropic effects
[01:41:04.940 --> 01:41:12.620]  okay you want to get you know you don't keep don't don't activate that THC. Can it
[01:41:12.620 --> 01:41:17.620]  activate in your gut though because we run you know. It won't activate in your gut and what Joey
[01:41:17.700 --> 01:41:22.540]  said about using the fan leaves is is real you just take those families
[01:41:22.540 --> 01:41:25.780]  instead of drop picking them and dropping them take them and juice them
[01:41:25.780 --> 01:41:30.860]  and again juicing is is by far superior because you're releasing easy water
[01:41:30.860 --> 01:41:37.660]  that's what's in the cell of the plants and so it's the best vehicle for taking
[01:41:37.660 --> 01:41:43.380]  those minors cannabinoids cannabinoids terpenes whatever else is in there and
[01:41:43.700 --> 01:41:49.260]  directly delivering it to your bloodstream. What type of juicer like a centrifugal or you're talking about?
[01:41:49.260 --> 01:41:56.140]  You know an auger so it grinds the material squishes it against to itself and you'll get
[01:41:56.140 --> 01:42:01.300]  a juice and that juice will be amazing. Damn that's a nugget right there.
[01:42:01.300 --> 01:42:09.500]  Appreciate that one. I need to go juice the plants. He taught me that shit and yeah it works and those
[01:42:09.540 --> 01:42:13.900]  juicers are no they're not cheap unfortunately but get the auger ones
[01:42:13.900 --> 01:42:18.980]  that really do pull out just the easy water attached with those second on
[01:42:18.980 --> 01:42:21.860]  Amazon you could you could find some I got one for like I think it was like a
[01:42:21.860 --> 01:42:24.900]  hundred bucks hundred twenty bucks an auger type they're getting cheaper out
[01:42:24.900 --> 01:42:27.900]  there if you search on Amazon because what I used to do is I used to juice a
[01:42:27.900 --> 01:42:32.500]  lot of my products when I because I blend all my before I ferment all my
[01:42:32.500 --> 01:42:36.180]  stuff I blend it for surface area reasons and I use used to juice the
[01:42:36.180 --> 01:42:40.060]  carrots and the apples and I was like a hundred and twenty bucks for the juicer
[01:42:40.060 --> 01:42:44.740]  head and it's a perfect juicer. Well you know one of my sayings either you know
[01:42:44.740 --> 01:42:52.020]  pay for quality or pay the doctor. So you might as well buy a good juicer instead of having to pay for health care later.
[01:42:52.020 --> 01:42:56.540]  Yeah exactly but yeah but going back to the auto flower stuff is it does make a
[01:42:56.540 --> 01:43:00.220]  good sense because it gives somebody the option somebody at the home that's not
[01:43:00.220 --> 01:43:05.260]  too versed they could throw one of these seeds in and grow a nice plant I believe
[01:43:05.260 --> 01:43:09.140]  auto flowers are the perfect house plant so to speak. I came to it it's the
[01:43:09.140 --> 01:43:12.620]  guitar hero of the Canada's world it allows you to you know participate
[01:43:12.620 --> 01:43:16.660]  without having to you know know everything and their requirements are
[01:43:16.660 --> 01:43:21.540]  lower and exactly neglect they will take neglect very well you know what I mean
[01:43:21.540 --> 01:43:24.860]  so that's a beautiful thing to say like you know what I mean put that into
[01:43:24.860 --> 01:43:28.140]  somebody's regimen see today that's cool not too many to have you're not worried
[01:43:28.140 --> 01:43:30.940]  about having 60 individual plant somewhere around the house but yeah
[01:43:31.260 --> 01:43:36.220]  having auto flowers gives that flexibility and also I tell people for
[01:43:36.220 --> 01:43:39.780]  extracts I think auto flowers are gonna that's where it's gonna fit nicely in
[01:43:39.780 --> 01:43:43.540]  the future for extract artists and that's gonna be big in a future I feel
[01:43:43.540 --> 01:43:47.660]  especially like no mathematics he's getting like purple extracts out of his
[01:43:47.660 --> 01:43:54.140]  out of his flowers so super cool he's pushing the envelope on that side for
[01:43:54.140 --> 01:43:57.420]  the extractors but yeah I feel like extract artists if you're not looking
[01:43:57.420 --> 01:44:01.900]  into auto flowers right now there's some some models out there that are that
[01:44:01.900 --> 01:44:05.100]  will make great candidates for that situation are you saying just because of
[01:44:05.100 --> 01:44:08.580]  the speed of turnaround are you saying they're strains which are like
[01:44:08.580 --> 01:44:13.300]  exceptional above and beyond I would say speed turnaround and the fact that they
[01:44:13.300 --> 01:44:17.100]  they're so versatile they you could just throw them out there since there's no
[01:44:17.100 --> 01:44:22.300]  light dictation on that you don't need any special infrastructure light depth
[01:44:22.500 --> 01:44:28.860]  you just throw them out there on a plot or in an area that you build any type of
[01:44:28.860 --> 01:44:38.340]  light long as you get I would do it like 16 hours or yeah exactly you're fine so
[01:44:38.340 --> 01:44:43.220]  even like 12 or even 12 12 they'll be great under two they're so versatile so
[01:44:43.220 --> 01:44:47.180]  I feel like it gives it's a something in your toolbox as a gardener to use and
[01:44:47.180 --> 01:44:50.380]  even breeding technology breeding on them too because you could their life
[01:44:50.380 --> 01:44:53.500]  cycles are so quick you can learn a lot of cool breeding techniques through auto
[01:44:53.500 --> 01:44:56.140]  flowers as well
[01:44:56.140 --> 01:45:03.060]  I got my 75 year old mom growing auto flowers last I'll go figure some of these
[01:45:03.060 --> 01:45:07.620]  auto some of these lion claws in her backyard a couple a couple high CBD hemp
[01:45:07.620 --> 01:45:13.660]  autos also yeah I saw some of mom's plants they look good I think I saw them
[01:45:13.660 --> 01:45:18.340]  on our Instagram or yours right yeah a couple nice ones going this year too
[01:45:18.340 --> 01:45:22.700]  that's a couple full terms going in the backyard but looking pretty good nice
[01:45:22.700 --> 01:45:26.620]  they're a nice way to supplement your season too so you grow autos in the
[01:45:26.620 --> 01:45:30.180]  beginning while you're waiting for the right time of the year to plant your
[01:45:30.180 --> 01:45:33.620]  other ones and then do it again in the fall because you know even if you get
[01:45:33.620 --> 01:45:37.300]  something out of it's better than nothing so it's correct with increased
[01:45:37.300 --> 01:45:44.380]  harvest correct but search do you do your homework there are a plethora of
[01:45:44.380 --> 01:45:48.100]  autos that absolutely are not good you will find more autos that are not good
[01:45:48.100 --> 01:45:51.140]  than it are good there's probably like five companies out there that are
[01:45:51.140 --> 01:45:58.980]  pushing out some stellar autos so yeah like the ones that the lion claw gnome
[01:45:58.980 --> 01:46:05.420]  automatic Mephisto night all seeds real Thor I think it's 98 has a good one too
[01:46:05.420 --> 01:46:09.900]  those are good auto flower twisted twisted flower auto flowers I'm missing
[01:46:09.900 --> 01:46:14.540]  a couple but those are the ones that I've ran on binary seeds magic stuff
[01:46:14.540 --> 01:46:18.700]  like that those are those are top containing auto flowers for sure and all
[01:46:18.700 --> 01:46:22.860]  those that have grown I've been amazing amazing time with them ones that you're
[01:46:22.860 --> 01:46:25.260]  like wow these are auto flowers interesting they're definitely not
[01:46:25.260 --> 01:46:28.140]  yesterday's auto flowers for sure but there's still companies out there that
[01:46:28.140 --> 01:46:32.460]  are out there still so so so your last greenhouse run those all no no I don't
[01:46:32.460 --> 01:46:37.500]  nothing in my greenhouse is autos I'll do models at my house and for more
[01:46:37.500 --> 01:46:41.420]  personal type things and but my full production stuff it's all photo period
[01:46:41.420 --> 01:46:46.100]  photo period stuff but I am gonna do a greenhouse in the future with all autos
[01:46:46.100 --> 01:46:51.980]  for sure it's just so versatile for sure you know I think these autos are
[01:46:51.980 --> 01:46:56.540]  gonna be super valuable to people who are still a gorilla growing if we'd had
[01:46:56.540 --> 01:47:00.220]  these kind of strains back in the 90s when we were having to grow in the
[01:47:00.220 --> 01:47:04.580]  woods and grow up in trees you know law enforcement camp doesn't usually start
[01:47:04.580 --> 01:47:08.620]  here till June July August they're not really ramping it up till July or August
[01:47:08.620 --> 01:47:13.340]  usually so we could have pulled runs in the full Sun and the bushes for the
[01:47:13.340 --> 01:47:18.540]  choppers even even blue that would have been huge so if I was having to go back
[01:47:18.540 --> 01:47:23.380]  into the forest and do gorilla grows right now I would because you can beat
[01:47:23.380 --> 01:47:29.220]  the trees you could be out there before the leaves you know early absolutely I
[01:47:29.220 --> 01:47:33.540]  could just be in the full Sun before any any action really happens and you don't
[01:47:33.540 --> 01:47:42.940]  have to feed them yeah I really want to direct so a lot more next year
[01:47:43.500 --> 01:47:50.380]  I gotta give them a try no perfect right there are key me lators there's a
[01:47:50.380 --> 01:47:56.300]  wonderful plant and you should be feeding them to our cows or sheep and
[01:47:56.300 --> 01:48:01.740]  pigs and everybody should be eating you know whether it's a CBD or a THC just
[01:48:01.740 --> 01:48:06.140]  don't just don't get it you know I'm just I'm just waiting to get to the
[01:48:06.140 --> 01:48:09.300]  point we get our favorites in auto for flower form like our favorite strains
[01:48:09.300 --> 01:48:15.300]  and I'd be dope you know I planted a lot of unsexed plants in my garden this
[01:48:15.300 --> 01:48:19.020]  year knowing that if they were males I was gonna just chop and drop them in
[01:48:19.020 --> 01:48:23.340]  place and I did a lot of that and I think that's something we could be
[01:48:23.340 --> 01:48:28.220]  getting into is more of a lot of direct sowing with autos and then literally
[01:48:28.220 --> 01:48:31.580]  just chopping and dropping them and building that cannabis you know micro
[01:48:31.580 --> 01:48:40.260]  soil interesting in place you know you know using it for for ferments using it
[01:48:40.260 --> 01:48:43.020]  for juicing you know stacking our functions getting as many uses out as
[01:48:43.020 --> 01:48:51.300]  possible smoking some even just to use at your leisure for different inputs you
[01:48:51.300 --> 01:48:55.100]  know have a small patch you know just like you said chop and drop organic
[01:48:55.100 --> 01:48:58.860]  material made from the plant that we're growing and you know best thing to grow
[01:48:58.860 --> 01:49:10.780]  a plant is a plant we all know that plants I subscribe to that but it's
[01:49:10.780 --> 01:49:13.980]  awesome so guys when it comes to like what are your favorite things to ferment
[01:49:13.980 --> 01:49:17.820]  that you guys find yourself always coming to ferment like you Joey what do
[01:49:17.820 --> 01:49:21.580]  you what what is your go-to ferment so to speak that you like that you have a
[01:49:21.580 --> 01:49:27.260]  pleasure fermenting well it's all seasonal for me you know early in the
[01:49:27.260 --> 01:49:31.140]  year it's it's you know the blackberry is kind of the first thing veggie and
[01:49:31.140 --> 01:49:38.340]  the nettle the dead nettle this purple redheaded nettle comes out and depending
[01:49:38.340 --> 01:49:42.100]  on how much I have of each of these inputs if it's something that's a pain
[01:49:42.100 --> 01:49:45.940]  in the ass to harvest like the nettle or or the miners let us something that's
[01:49:45.940 --> 01:49:52.700]  really tiny I'll make you know FPJ is out of those because I want to I only
[01:49:52.700 --> 01:49:55.780]  have a little bit of it if it's something I have an abundance of like
[01:49:55.780 --> 01:50:00.260]  the blackberry I'll do the JLF I'll do a 50 gallon drum of it you know we did a
[01:50:00.260 --> 01:50:06.620]  bunch these 50 gallon drops this spring so it's it's really seasonal for me
[01:50:06.620 --> 01:50:10.300]  those are some of the ones I like first lane is a cool one that comes out in the
[01:50:10.300 --> 01:50:15.260]  spring we have the horse tail come out here in June the bracken fern I really
[01:50:15.260 --> 01:50:20.380]  love I've been using it for pesticide for the last year but I found out this
[01:50:20.380 --> 01:50:23.900]  year that it's also high phosphorus and now we're fermenting it for phosphorus
[01:50:23.900 --> 01:50:31.180]  and it grows all over sorry what was that I was spacing out as you said what
[01:50:31.180 --> 01:50:38.480]  it was the bracken fern bracken fern very powerful pesticide and also high
[01:50:38.480 --> 01:50:44.660]  in FOSS and then I learned this year that the mistletoe was also high in
[01:50:44.660 --> 01:50:50.540]  FOSS that I talked about earlier so it takes a while to break down and and
[01:50:50.540 --> 01:50:54.020]  being near the ocean here you know we're two hour drive of the ocean we go
[01:50:54.020 --> 01:51:00.540]  out there we gather seawater super valuable input and we gather the mussel
[01:51:00.540 --> 01:51:05.300]  shells that wash up on the beach and the seaweed so you know that's a pretty good
[01:51:05.300 --> 01:51:09.340]  lineup right there oh yeah that's most of my feeding right there yeah that's
[01:51:09.340 --> 01:51:13.300]  the beautiful bracken fern it kind of grows doesn't really grow in a bunch it
[01:51:13.300 --> 01:51:17.660]  kind of grows like one stem on its own you can pull the root out is the most
[01:51:17.660 --> 01:51:22.660]  powerful part it's harder to pull out in the summertime when the soils really
[01:51:22.660 --> 01:51:26.980]  dry they just want to break off but in the early spring or if you can find any
[01:51:26.980 --> 01:51:31.180]  in the winter you they pull out pretty easily but in the springtime they really
[01:51:31.180 --> 01:51:35.820]  start blooming and growing right now you know you see them alongside the roads
[01:51:35.820 --> 01:51:42.740]  and all the shady areas north sides of people's properties is where we usually
[01:51:42.740 --> 01:51:46.860]  look for them down near the riparian areas and the gullies near the
[01:51:46.860 --> 01:51:51.060]  water's edge yeah I love that bracken fern I got a little area called fern
[01:51:51.060 --> 01:51:55.900]  gully where I actually collect these ferns and I plant them there you know so
[01:51:55.900 --> 01:52:01.100]  I have them oh I'm a you know I'm a lazy gardener you know I like to put in the
[01:52:01.100 --> 01:52:06.620]  effort at the beginning and then now I have it all there I got fern gully so I
[01:52:06.620 --> 01:52:12.020]  got bracken ferns at my disposal you know things like that like Joey said I
[01:52:12.180 --> 01:52:17.500]  like seasonal one of my favorites is seaweed I like to ferment it make a
[01:52:17.500 --> 01:52:21.940]  vinegar you know that's awesome input it's got all the benefits of seawater
[01:52:21.940 --> 01:52:27.820]  and then it's got the fermentation fermented a seaweed plant I think that's
[01:52:27.820 --> 01:52:31.820]  awesome one yeah get hormones oh yeah plenty of plenty of goodness in the
[01:52:31.820 --> 01:52:37.980]  seaweed do you do any sugar ferments yeah I do I do I've um back backed off
[01:52:37.980 --> 01:52:45.380]  of those a little bit and uh so I like to consider myself um say 40% Jadon 40%
[01:52:45.380 --> 01:52:51.380]  of the kind of the sugar inputs and in 20% of me as the farmer and using the
[01:52:51.380 --> 01:52:55.820]  combination of those and other things but yeah I do definitely do sugar
[01:52:55.820 --> 01:53:01.540]  ferments I like using when I'm brewing teas you know I instead of adding you
[01:53:01.540 --> 01:53:07.340]  know a sugar or source of sugar I would use something like a comfrey FBJ you
[01:53:07.340 --> 01:53:11.460]  know that's already got sugar so I'm gonna feed my microbes and my tea and
[01:53:11.460 --> 01:53:16.380]  then I'm also gonna add the benefits of the comfrey make sense I like to do I
[01:53:16.380 --> 01:53:21.900]  like to take the principles that we have and within those principles kind of
[01:53:21.900 --> 01:53:26.380]  experiment with different ways of doing that's my background that's 100% what I
[01:53:26.380 --> 01:53:29.300]  take on it can have inspired okay there we go
[01:53:29.300 --> 01:53:34.900]  just quickly did you guys see the bracken fern question about what what
[01:53:34.900 --> 01:53:42.260]  pesticidal properties does it have yeah I'm not sure I learned about it in the
[01:53:42.260 --> 01:53:47.380]  Jadon pesticide book this is one of the recommended very powerful pesticides I
[01:53:47.380 --> 01:53:55.100]  use it last year on aphids very successfully and now now when I make
[01:53:55.100 --> 01:53:59.740]  those pesticides I'll combine three different herbs or three different three
[01:53:59.740 --> 01:54:04.740]  different plants through them all together I've been using a lot of the
[01:54:04.740 --> 01:54:09.180]  curly dock and that horsetail both are fungicide or both will fight the
[01:54:09.180 --> 01:54:14.700]  poverty mildew that is really prevailing out here even more so smoke seems like
[01:54:14.700 --> 01:54:20.580]  these last smoky couple years the PM's gotten even worse out here what do you
[01:54:20.580 --> 01:54:27.980]  think about that lady yeah I mean I think that you're again diversity
[01:54:28.500 --> 01:54:35.060]  that's what you're using and so answer the question I'm all about aquatic
[01:54:35.060 --> 01:54:39.900]  plants yeah I'll do moringa and some other ones that I know have incredible
[01:54:39.900 --> 01:54:46.140]  properties my backbone fermentation and no sugar is just water and I love the
[01:54:46.140 --> 01:54:51.060]  aquatic plants although they're real difficult to find healthy clean sources
[01:54:51.060 --> 01:54:56.540]  you have to you have to know your water so know your watershed but I find that
[01:54:56.540 --> 01:55:01.860]  they're an amazing way to jumpstart compost is using aquatic plants to
[01:55:01.860 --> 01:55:08.220]  ferment you know five to seven days it's foamy it should smell weird like again
[01:55:08.220 --> 01:55:13.460]  our smell is designed to warn us if something is really bad that we don't
[01:55:13.460 --> 01:55:19.420]  need it or something smells sweet to enjoy it and so what you'll notice is
[01:55:19.420 --> 01:55:23.340]  this smells but you don't recognize your body kind of goes well what the fuck is
[01:55:23.340 --> 01:55:27.460]  that it's not good it's not bad I don't I don't recognize it and when it smells
[01:55:27.460 --> 01:55:32.220]  like that you know it's ready that the fresh started compost that's pretty much
[01:55:32.220 --> 01:55:38.460]  where I use most of my ferments is in soil building again I can't grow where I
[01:55:38.460 --> 01:55:43.820]  am here I signed a lease that said I wouldn't even go hamster stop it's all
[01:55:43.820 --> 01:55:49.540]  right man most of the time I'm not working anyway you know exactly and
[01:55:49.540 --> 01:55:58.620]  don't worry I get the love shared to me guys and I get you love sooner or later
[01:55:58.620 --> 01:56:03.700]  what do you think about the possibility of the smoke leading to more pathogens
[01:56:03.700 --> 01:56:08.700]  and leading to more power you know there was a real real interesting article I
[01:56:08.700 --> 01:56:13.500]  read it's a whole new line of biology that's being studied right now in
[01:56:13.500 --> 01:56:18.820]  Morcal about understanding how microbes move in smoke and so it and it was it
[01:56:18.820 --> 01:56:26.060]  was mind-blowing that actually protozoa fungi and bacteria are moving in the
[01:56:26.060 --> 01:56:32.340]  soot ash and smoke and so it really made me start thinking back about you know
[01:56:32.340 --> 01:56:38.380]  the early work that NASA did in 2011 about the Sahara Desert sandstorms going
[01:56:38.380 --> 01:56:43.300]  across the ocean and feeding the Amazon and so here we have these wildfires the
[01:56:43.300 --> 01:56:47.820]  wildfires down in Australia the smoke came to South Africa or South America
[01:56:47.820 --> 01:56:51.980]  and up the coast up here as well and all the smoke from here is going out to
[01:56:51.980 --> 01:56:57.140]  the East Coast and all of those microbes are being transferred along with it so
[01:56:57.140 --> 01:57:03.340]  of course there would be some pathogens along with some good ones and yeah that
[01:57:03.340 --> 01:57:10.180]  that smoke is is gonna change the pH or the dust that ash is gonna change the pH
[01:57:10.180 --> 01:57:14.540]  on the leaf surface and so if you're if you have a plant that's sensitive to
[01:57:14.540 --> 01:57:21.180]  milled oak, bang, you're done. It's gonna go ballistic so yeah there's
[01:57:21.180 --> 01:57:27.940]  there's nature's uh nature's fucking deep man and you know the consequences of
[01:57:27.940 --> 01:57:31.900]  some of these things can be catastrophic and also very beneficial depending on
[01:57:31.900 --> 01:57:42.540]  which side of the bell curve you're on. Yeah yeah. Hopefully I answered your question Joey.
[01:57:42.540 --> 01:57:47.260]  I had a conversation with Kevin Jodry about some of this a couple years back and he
[01:57:47.260 --> 01:57:51.500]  used to run this light depth cannabis cup here called the Golden Tarp Award
[01:57:51.500 --> 01:57:56.260]  and this was probably around 2015 or 16 and it was one of the first cups that
[01:57:56.260 --> 01:58:00.300]  actually had some testing involved where they were doing microbial testing and
[01:58:00.300 --> 01:58:03.740]  they were not just testing cannabinoids and terpenes all the judging was based
[01:58:03.740 --> 01:58:10.020]  on terpenes so they were doing a lot of testing but the they could tell where
[01:58:10.020 --> 01:58:14.220]  the entries were from because there were certain entries that failed for
[01:58:14.220 --> 01:58:18.420]  microbial and they were all from these counties where they're having big fires
[01:58:18.420 --> 01:58:24.580]  and big smoke. It was all the fail from Grassland Valley and from over in Chesapeake.
[01:58:24.580 --> 01:58:32.540]  That was what could have been in if there was something going on. The smoke was really causing microbial failure was
[01:58:32.540 --> 01:58:37.220]  you know like you're saying it's microbes traveling through that ash and
[01:58:37.220 --> 01:58:43.860]  through that burning debris. We had you know the giant fire here last summer two
[01:58:43.860 --> 01:58:47.700]  miles away from us the whole hill across from Hartwood here is totally burned. We
[01:58:47.700 --> 01:58:55.700]  had to evacuate for two weeks and when I came back there was burnt leaf all over
[01:58:55.700 --> 01:59:00.420]  the property all over the ground. These you know giant cumulus clouds had lifted
[01:59:00.420 --> 01:59:05.100]  up all this burnt material brought it you know two three four miles across the
[01:59:05.100 --> 01:59:10.540]  valley. It's a miracle no fire started over here but there was burnt material
[01:59:10.540 --> 01:59:15.340]  from all over this property. I live up here on the ridge so it was really all
[01:59:15.340 --> 01:59:22.220]  over the place. So yeah what are those microbes that landed over here? What
[01:59:22.220 --> 01:59:27.980]  came with them? Is it a bunch of pathogens? You know I would probably tell
[01:59:27.980 --> 01:59:34.020]  you that it wasn't just pathogens. It was a lot of good ones too. Pathogens tend to
[01:59:34.020 --> 01:59:41.460]  be on the lower side of the ratio. More often than not if you have a healthy
[01:59:41.460 --> 01:59:45.780]  soil system you're gonna have very few pathogens and in some cases the
[01:59:45.780 --> 01:59:49.820]  beneficials will turn those pathogens into a mutualist so that you know
[01:59:49.820 --> 01:59:53.700]  fusarium will actually become a saprophyte in the right microbial
[01:59:53.700 --> 02:00:01.180]  communities. So the pathogens are definitely less than the good guys. The
[02:00:01.180 --> 02:00:05.940]  problem is when you kill the soil or it goes out of balance the pathogens always
[02:00:05.940 --> 02:00:11.900]  come back first. So what what really happens in a fire you know that's that's
[02:00:11.900 --> 02:00:16.780]  a really interesting question but it's kind of like landing you know an army in
[02:00:16.780 --> 02:00:21.100]  the middle of America and expecting them to take over. It's not gonna happen
[02:00:21.100 --> 02:00:25.540]  because they don't have the reinforcement. So whether they were good
[02:00:25.540 --> 02:00:29.660]  guys or bad guys in my mind they became a biostimulant. They supported your
[02:00:29.700 --> 02:00:33.300]  microbial community that was living there presently. Then again they may have
[02:00:33.300 --> 02:00:36.860]  stimulated it in a good way or they may have just become a food source for your
[02:00:36.860 --> 02:00:42.620]  existing microbes or or maybe they did inoculate and are working in community
[02:00:42.620 --> 02:00:46.660]  with what you have there. So it could have increased your diversity but my gut
[02:00:46.660 --> 02:00:52.420]  feeling is it didn't it didn't increase your pathogenic potential.
[02:00:52.420 --> 02:01:01.980]  I was so blessed to be able to study under Lain for 18 months and
[02:01:01.980 --> 02:01:06.620]  really you know go down these rabbit holes. Anaerobic versus aero, pathogen
[02:01:06.620 --> 02:01:12.300]  versus beneficial and and trying to you know really wrap your head around how
[02:01:12.300 --> 02:01:17.900]  incredibly diverse and complicated you know these types of situations are. You
[02:01:17.900 --> 02:01:21.940]  know people like oh don't use anaerobic teas, don't use anaerobes. Well you
[02:01:21.940 --> 02:01:30.380]  shouldn't in an aerobic condition or anaerobic application. You
[02:01:30.380 --> 02:01:34.580]  shouldn't be using anaerobes in an aerobic soil because now you are
[02:01:34.580 --> 02:01:40.420]  knocking back your aerobes. But if you have dead dirt or soil that's been left
[02:01:40.420 --> 02:01:45.860]  on you know uncared for, using a facultative anaerobes to get that thing
[02:01:45.860 --> 02:01:53.380]  going works incredibly well. I mean I've I've done fields of dirt by applying you
[02:01:53.380 --> 02:01:58.460]  know facultatives or low oxygen. Jeffrey was very enthusiastic about
[02:01:58.460 --> 02:02:04.940]  facultative anaerobes. Alright Jeffrey. People are scared of them. Is that your Bokashi
[02:02:04.940 --> 02:02:10.660]  similar to that process? Would that be? Yeah. Yeah. So I use that a lot for
[02:02:10.660 --> 02:02:14.700]  building soil. I mean it's all good stuff but it takes a little time. Yeah it's
[02:02:14.700 --> 02:02:19.340]  spot-on. It's spot-on and I recently did a podcast with Django because of the
[02:02:19.340 --> 02:02:24.500]  amount of people that are questioning like anaerobic versus aerobic and you
[02:02:24.500 --> 02:02:29.020]  know there's applications for both. This is what nature does. I mean she creates
[02:02:29.020 --> 02:02:32.700]  swamps. She creates you know mud silt along the edge of the river where you
[02:02:32.700 --> 02:02:37.580]  step in it and you pull your foot out and you're like oh man. You gotta embrace the funk.
[02:02:37.580 --> 02:02:42.780]  Right. Right. You know and there's a purpose. There's a function for all this.
[02:02:42.860 --> 02:02:47.580]  It's just you have to use common sense and you know some decent you know
[02:02:47.580 --> 02:02:51.620]  knowledge or background of what you're up against before you go diving in or
[02:02:51.620 --> 02:02:59.260]  you're gonna fuck yourself. That's for sure. But I'm a little off the subject there.
[02:02:59.420 --> 02:03:04.380]  No that's great Leighton. I caught your podcast with Django and I thought it was
[02:03:04.380 --> 02:03:08.460]  awesome and you really hammered it home that it is all about diversity in that
[02:03:08.460 --> 02:03:15.820]  soil and that diversity of microbes and diversity of biology. Yeah that was really a good one.
[02:03:15.820 --> 02:03:17.820]  I definitely recommend everybody listen to it.
[02:03:17.820 --> 02:03:19.820]  Yeah you know
[02:03:21.100 --> 02:03:27.460]  nature isn't mono. Nature is diversity and the more you can encourage that
[02:03:27.460 --> 02:03:33.420]  diversity whether it's bringing in plants or insects or you know whatever
[02:03:33.420 --> 02:03:39.140]  the better off you are. And when I make compost I don't just use feedstocks man.
[02:03:39.140 --> 02:03:43.420]  I go out and collect every single diverse thing I can find in the greens
[02:03:43.420 --> 02:03:49.260]  and browns and then I make it. And it works. It works great. So you know in your
[02:03:49.260 --> 02:03:52.820]  ferments there's no reason why you can't add a bunch of different types of plants.
[02:03:52.820 --> 02:03:58.780]  And see what happens. Yeah definitely. You know. I've been doing a lot of inoculation and stuff.
[02:03:58.780 --> 02:04:02.460]  I tend to go towards more of the fungal dominance when it comes to these
[02:04:02.460 --> 02:04:09.420]  cannabis related stuff. I've been using a biovast from SD microbes with great
[02:04:09.420 --> 02:04:13.700]  success or anything that's you know like a lot of forest litter stuff. High in
[02:04:13.700 --> 02:04:18.700]  fungal dominance. I feel like my beds have been loving that side of things.
[02:04:18.700 --> 02:04:25.020]  Definitely. I mean that's that's been humanity's biggest pitfall is that they
[02:04:25.020 --> 02:04:31.420]  don't comprehend the fact that fungi represent half of all nutrient cycling.
[02:04:31.460 --> 02:04:36.940]  So if you're just dealing with protozoa and bacteria you're missing 50 percent of
[02:04:36.940 --> 02:04:43.060]  your potential. And every time you till the soil it's gone. You destroyed it all.
[02:04:43.060 --> 02:04:48.220]  And especially the mycorrhizae. And that takes years to come back. And saplings.
[02:04:48.220 --> 02:04:53.460]  Same thing. They take a long time to come back. So you know again this is all about
[02:04:53.460 --> 02:04:58.620]  you know no till. Building regenerative beds. And don't disturb them man. Leave
[02:04:59.060 --> 02:05:03.660]  the root balls in the ground. Harvest what you need from the top and give back. Always
[02:05:03.660 --> 02:05:07.900]  be given back. And you know I said that at a regen conference and again I almost got
[02:05:07.900 --> 02:05:14.020]  friggin booed off the stage. In old days 50 percent of your crop was left in the field
[02:05:14.020 --> 02:05:18.820]  to fill the soil and to bring the fertility back. Like you know these ferments that were
[02:05:18.820 --> 02:05:24.340]  made. Chop and drop. Yeah. Chop and drop. Yeah. I got a little bit of heat for when
[02:05:24.340 --> 02:05:27.580]  I put my old soil back in my new beds. I'm like no. I thought you know I'm like dude
[02:05:28.100 --> 02:05:31.540]  how am I going to get my new soil into my bed if I don't throw it in there.
[02:05:31.540 --> 02:05:36.540]  Recycle your soil. I've seen I've seen people taking tractor trailer loads of soil
[02:05:36.540 --> 02:05:41.140]  just throw it in the track like dumpsters. You know what I mean. Old soil. That's a
[02:05:41.140 --> 02:05:46.580]  that's a resource. You know let the microbiology rework that. Use it again. Save
[02:05:46.580 --> 02:05:51.420]  your money. You know what I mean. Those are just regenerative regenerative. You know
[02:05:51.420 --> 02:05:55.580]  those are the things we're trying to do. Yeah. And you're spot on. I mean the old
[02:05:55.860 --> 02:05:59.940]  gorilla grows or diesel grows where they were growing in containers and Joey you know
[02:05:59.940 --> 02:06:04.300]  all of this shit. They would always take this. There's all their fucking soils and toss
[02:06:04.300 --> 02:06:09.460]  them out the back. And the problem was they were so sodic. They were so caked with
[02:06:09.460 --> 02:06:15.100]  with salts that you couldn't grow anything. And I've had a number of people over the
[02:06:15.100 --> 02:06:19.340]  years say I have a mountain soil. What can I do with it. It's all fucking sodic. I'm
[02:06:19.340 --> 02:06:25.140]  like just leave it alone. Nature will wash that out. And remember a single ionic
[02:06:25.140 --> 02:06:32.220]  bond. Potassium. Magnesium. Potassium is a single but magnesium and calcium are double
[02:06:32.220 --> 02:06:38.020]  bond. So you let that shit let the water rain wash it out of there. And then all you got
[02:06:38.020 --> 02:06:43.660]  to do is up your cow mag which I'm going to get shit for. But there's some truth to
[02:06:43.660 --> 02:06:50.620]  that. Both of those both of those elements have a double bond so they'll quickly push
[02:06:50.620 --> 02:06:56.900]  us off any remaining sodium will get pushed off. You know you could do too as well as
[02:06:56.900 --> 02:07:01.900]  if you feed it humic acid as well. It will push all that out as well. If you get a session
[02:07:01.900 --> 02:07:08.380]  of humic throw it in there. Salinity wise it'll it'll break all that up. Now it's amazing
[02:07:08.380 --> 02:07:15.540]  the power of humic acid to making chemistry play play nice. Exactly. Definitely. I use
[02:07:15.540 --> 02:07:20.340]  it's one of the major things that I use in my gardening is I try to make sure my humic
[02:07:20.340 --> 02:07:25.220]  levels are always constant. So it has that restructuring factor. So it's always present
[02:07:25.220 --> 02:07:33.500]  in the soil. Very important. Definitely. So in a horizon bed naturally. How do you in
[02:07:33.500 --> 02:07:39.820]  a in a hugel bed and horizon is that like humic acid. Why is that naturally formed in
[02:07:39.820 --> 02:07:45.260]  the hugel bed or how how do they go about it. Well remember all your organic matter
[02:07:45.260 --> 02:07:54.660]  all your browns are human. Yeah. So you you can press them you can agitate them. You know
[02:07:54.660 --> 02:08:01.380]  any type of force will release those you know those smaller atomic particles of the of the
[02:08:01.380 --> 02:08:09.420]  humic acid or the humic acid. I go out to my leaf mold pile and where it's like soupy
[02:08:09.420 --> 02:08:14.380]  and soppy. You throw that in a burlap sack and I squeeze it out and then I got a got
[02:08:14.460 --> 02:08:18.540]  all the humic acid I want. And you water that in. And then I'll just put that right in.
[02:08:19.340 --> 02:08:22.380]  Dude that was you know I think you did a show on that didn't you.
[02:08:23.740 --> 02:08:27.820]  I probably did a video or something on that. Yeah. Because what happened was I bought it.
[02:08:28.700 --> 02:08:36.460]  I bought like this fruit press for like making apple cider or whatnot. And I'm like I just never
[02:08:36.460 --> 02:08:41.580]  got around to pressing any fruit. So I started looking at this thing and I took some some
[02:08:42.140 --> 02:08:48.220]  old leaves and a mesh bag and put them in this and then pressed them out. So I got a good use
[02:08:48.220 --> 02:08:53.420]  for a fruit press. I think I'm gonna start doing that. Yeah it works man. You talk about the one
[02:08:53.420 --> 02:08:57.100]  that looks like a barrel. Yeah it's like a little cup and then you just turn the handle and it
[02:08:57.100 --> 02:09:00.860]  presses. Yeah it's got the plywood that sticks up on top to press it. Yeah definitely. They work
[02:09:00.860 --> 02:09:05.580]  really nice. But even if you don't have a press you can just like I said squeeze it out. Even
[02:09:05.660 --> 02:09:11.740]  things like if you got a big leaf pile or a compost pile put like a tray up under bottom
[02:09:11.740 --> 02:09:17.020]  where when it rains you can kind of collect many of that humic acid that might drop you know come
[02:09:17.020 --> 02:09:22.300]  on down through there. So that's a good one too. Humic also does dechlorinate water. I use that
[02:09:23.020 --> 02:09:27.500]  for my because I'm in a city and I use it for my chloramines because you can't either and I don't
[02:09:27.500 --> 02:09:31.980]  want to use a filter or anything like that. I just like so I'll use my humic to handle those chloramines.
[02:09:32.940 --> 02:09:37.740]  Well another even better one I forgot who taught me this off the top of my head but
[02:09:38.540 --> 02:09:45.580]  you can make lab out of instead of rice wash terraflora organics. You can use instead of
[02:09:45.580 --> 02:09:51.500]  using rice wash use that same humic acid to make your LAB. Oh interesting. You can make your LAB
[02:09:51.500 --> 02:09:57.340]  without rice wash and you got your own indigenous humics that you use. I thought that was really
[02:09:57.340 --> 02:10:03.100]  awesome. I think I need to make some. Yeah. I love this. I love this channel.
[02:10:06.460 --> 02:10:12.380]  What Chad just posted was actually one of the most interesting things from Dr. Faust which I thought
[02:10:12.380 --> 02:10:18.540]  was kind of crazy. Yeah I've been I've been using humics heavily heavily and I've never had any
[02:10:18.540 --> 02:10:23.580]  problems with my THC levels. I've also heard that it will also make things go hermaphrodite as well.
[02:10:23.660 --> 02:10:30.540]  I think that's maybe some case for some plants but I've never come across that in the plants
[02:10:30.540 --> 02:10:35.180]  that I've grown at least but there's there's merit in probably anything everything said for sure.
[02:10:35.180 --> 02:10:39.340]  You can't overdo anything. Anything you overdo you're gonna be taking from something else. It's
[02:10:39.340 --> 02:10:43.580]  all about balance and diversity like Leighton's always saying. Well I think they're saying too
[02:10:43.580 --> 02:10:48.060]  because a lot of people get information and then the human nature is always to overdo it because
[02:10:48.060 --> 02:10:52.780]  we're always hovering over our plants and we're like always adding and adding and adding and
[02:10:52.780 --> 02:10:58.700]  that fine line we always step over. Well speaking of stepping over like I'm amending my
[02:10:58.700 --> 02:11:06.620]  horizontal soil and I felt like it was amended really nice plants growing nice and so I applied
[02:11:06.620 --> 02:11:13.900]  a foliar which was a high which was a comfrey JLF and so I applied a foliar and just the amount of
[02:11:13.900 --> 02:11:19.580]  that foliar almost pushed me to nitrogen toxicity like my soil was like that's how strong some of
[02:11:19.580 --> 02:11:25.580]  those foliars can be so like the two days after my leaves started tips started trying to curl down
[02:11:25.580 --> 02:11:31.820]  and stuff got really dark yeah it's not water only so you know just in another week of water only I
[02:11:31.820 --> 02:11:37.500]  came back but you gotta be observant you gotta watch your plants some of these foliars can be
[02:11:37.500 --> 02:11:44.940]  very very powerful and happen work really fast. Dilute the shit out of it before you try it right?
[02:11:44.940 --> 02:11:54.060]  That's right yeah that's right definitely I agree with that I think Peter said it doing it on a test
[02:11:54.060 --> 02:12:00.860]  plant. Well that's why you grow more than one type of plant you got other plants you test things on
[02:12:00.860 --> 02:12:05.980]  and you know it's all part of the game. Yeah definitely we're all learning you know we're
[02:12:05.980 --> 02:12:11.340]  collectively. I wanted to ask you a question I've been working with some people up in Humboldt too
[02:12:11.340 --> 02:12:18.380]  with deer issues and so I told them I'm like you know instead of like building a fence and trying
[02:12:18.380 --> 02:12:22.860]  to keep them out because they keep crashing it knocking it down why don't you grow some plants
[02:12:22.860 --> 02:12:29.820]  outside the fence I think they're I think they love blue dream for some reason. Right?
[02:12:30.620 --> 02:12:36.620]  Makes them all ineffective right? So I had them plant some blue dream outside the fence
[02:12:36.620 --> 02:12:42.860]  never fucking bothered me. A proper sacrifice. Wow that's great. I had
[02:12:43.980 --> 02:12:50.860]  I had deer breaking my fence down this year and getting into our Buddha garden and I noticed that
[02:12:50.860 --> 02:12:57.180]  the uh sun chokes were a great trap plant for the deer to keep them away for the ganja. I literally
[02:12:57.180 --> 02:13:03.580]  had sun chokes in between each ganja plant and they ate those and left the ganja alone. So yeah
[02:13:03.580 --> 02:13:07.740]  there's certainly a lot of plants you can grow outside the fence that'll keep them happy.
[02:13:09.100 --> 02:13:13.340]  You know we can't grow anything outside the fence here that the deer or the pigs will eat.
[02:13:13.340 --> 02:13:18.700]  We have a lot of wild pigs here. Down at my girlfriend's place in Lake County she has no
[02:13:18.700 --> 02:13:21.900]  you know half a fence around her garden. She has no deer there. She's also got
[02:13:22.540 --> 02:13:24.540]  six dogs living on the property I think.
[02:13:25.260 --> 02:13:34.460]  So yeah there's no deer anywhere near that garden. We used to see wild stuff back here in the day.
[02:13:34.460 --> 02:13:40.140]  People would have four dogs on on runs surrounding their gardens because they're too lazy to put a
[02:13:40.140 --> 02:13:46.140]  fence up. I mean you saw really messed up stuff like that you know. That's kind of me. Yeah you
[02:13:47.020 --> 02:13:52.940]  got to put a fence up man. The deer are no joke here and the pigs especially. Especially in this
[02:13:52.940 --> 02:13:57.500]  drought year all the all the muddy watering holes are drying up so they're going to be breaking into
[02:13:57.500 --> 02:14:01.980]  people's gardens looking for moisture. If you're in grow bags or smart pots are going to be breaking
[02:14:01.980 --> 02:14:07.100]  those open looking for bugs looking for worms looking for food sources. Oh wow that's rough.
[02:14:07.100 --> 02:14:12.540]  That's a pain probably to do. I didn't know there were pigs up there.
[02:14:13.180 --> 02:14:19.740]  I didn't know there were pigs up there. Oh tons of them yeah. They surround my house. I posted a
[02:14:19.740 --> 02:14:26.780]  video the other day of like you know 15 little babies just outside my house. Will they attack
[02:14:26.780 --> 02:14:33.660]  you? They run away. I mean they say if you're in the woods with a broken leg or something maybe
[02:14:33.660 --> 02:14:38.140]  they try to eat you but for the most part they just run away. They're trying to stay away from
[02:14:38.140 --> 02:14:45.100]  you but there's definitely a lot of them here. There's a lot of plants we can grow around here
[02:14:45.100 --> 02:14:52.140]  that are deer resistant you know that they don't mess with. Lavender, rosemary, dollar trees.
[02:14:53.020 --> 02:14:57.660]  There's great plants that are deer and drought resistant and Hartwood's got a ton of these
[02:14:57.660 --> 02:15:03.660]  planted all over it so it's really a great example of that. So yeah there's a lot of
[02:15:03.660 --> 02:15:08.940]  fruit trees you know figs they won't mess with a fig tree. So there's a lot of different you
[02:15:08.940 --> 02:15:13.100]  know plants that we can get yields out of especially things to make ferments or
[02:15:13.100 --> 02:15:17.580]  John Ruppel solution pesticides out of that we could build grow you know grow on those
[02:15:17.580 --> 02:15:21.180]  swales or those oogles that we talked about that could be all over your property.
[02:15:24.060 --> 02:15:29.340]  Yeah so more deer resistant plants. I've fed a lot of ganja to the deer over the years.
[02:15:30.300 --> 02:15:36.140]  I don't like messing with deer because of their tics. I'm terrified of tics because of Lyme disease
[02:15:36.140 --> 02:15:40.300]  so when I see deer I'm like oh great. Oh well don't come to the east coast because I get
[02:15:40.300 --> 02:15:45.740]  tics walking on me like every other day. Are you serious? Oh yeah. Oh I freak out dude. I can't stand it.
[02:15:46.780 --> 02:15:52.140]  I've listened to too many Joe Rogan podcasts to want to mess with the Lyme disease.
[02:15:52.300 --> 02:15:58.300]  I said everybody in New England's got Lyme's disease at the very minimum at least once in
[02:15:58.300 --> 02:16:03.100]  their life. It's crazy. I heard if you get it quick enough you can get rid of it but it's a
[02:16:03.100 --> 02:16:08.620]  long-term type of thing so it's like dang. Well you know my buddies are immune. We've been growing
[02:16:08.620 --> 02:16:13.500]  up fishing and hunting and man I don't know how many tics I pulled out my ass over the years.
[02:16:15.020 --> 02:16:20.220]  I mean still. I mean I'm still a young man. I'm still a young man. I'm still a young man.
[02:16:20.700 --> 02:16:23.740]  I mean still going still going strong.
[02:16:25.740 --> 02:16:33.340]  Actually I use a neem soap that my dad actually gets from India and if I know I'm going out in
[02:16:33.340 --> 02:16:37.020]  the woods for a day, if I'm going to someone's property or I know there's gonna be a lot of dogs
[02:16:37.020 --> 02:16:41.660]  or I know I'm gonna be pulling goobles, I'll wash down with that neem soap before I go out there
[02:16:41.660 --> 02:16:47.500]  for a day and I you know maybe it's keeping them off me maybe it's not. I still pull plenty of them
[02:16:47.500 --> 02:16:54.220]  off me. I think we could be making our own soaps and you know I think if we're you know making
[02:16:54.220 --> 02:16:59.340]  you know making jadam wetting agent which is a soap and you can put herbs in it make it a herbal
[02:16:59.340 --> 02:17:05.260]  wetting agent. I think it would have some you know have some effects. It's probably killing some of
[02:17:05.260 --> 02:17:10.300]  the biology on your body but you know we're washing some of that off every time we're using soap
[02:17:10.300 --> 02:17:18.620]  anyways. Yeah one thing we do at my house is well I spray the triple threat beneficial
[02:17:18.620 --> 02:17:26.940]  nematodes and they say they go after ticks and fleas and I don't I haven't had as many
[02:17:26.940 --> 02:17:32.220]  issues with that in my on my property since I've been doing those beneficial nematodes.
[02:17:32.220 --> 02:17:38.620]  I spray my whole property religiously. Yeah well you're good once a season if they hang in there
[02:17:38.620 --> 02:17:44.060]  a little bit. Yeah but the biggest thing for us is we don't go out in the woods in the summer like
[02:17:44.060 --> 02:17:48.700]  you got to wait till fall and then let the bugs go down then you're out in the woods more.
[02:17:49.500 --> 02:17:55.980]  Another another really good trick is cedar oil. So you get cedar oil you dilute it with water
[02:17:55.980 --> 02:18:02.300]  and you mist it on from your knees down and that helps a lot to keep them from actually crawling
[02:18:02.380 --> 02:18:06.460]  on you or jumping on you. So if you guys are yeah that's it that's it.
[02:18:07.900 --> 02:18:13.100]  Let me smoke it you know. I'm gonna use that one. Well if you're afraid of ticks then look up
[02:18:13.100 --> 02:18:20.220]  chiggers when you get a chance. You really won't be coming to the east coast. Don't do that to me
[02:18:20.220 --> 02:18:30.300]  Mark. No but definitely. What's up? Oh Layden can I ask you a question? I've been going on another
[02:18:30.300 --> 02:18:36.140]  deep dive into the living soil food web and rereading Teeming with Microbes for the third
[02:18:36.140 --> 02:18:39.820]  or fourth time. You know every couple years you've got to revisit that one and I'm getting
[02:18:39.820 --> 02:18:47.260]  a better understanding of the soil food web and you know they're talking about you know annual
[02:18:47.260 --> 02:18:53.340]  vegetables liking a bacterial dominant soil and perennials liking more of a fungally dominant
[02:18:53.340 --> 02:19:00.380]  soil. And why does cannabis like this fungally dominant soil? Is it because it has that long
[02:19:00.380 --> 02:19:05.100]  life cycle that it can still grow for eight or nine months or even though it's an annual? I mean
[02:19:05.100 --> 02:19:12.860]  you're saying they need a balance. You definitely want fungi and bacteria in there. I'll try to
[02:19:12.860 --> 02:19:19.900]  answer it. Really it's again it goes back to what I said earlier about losing 50 percent of your
[02:19:19.900 --> 02:19:25.900]  nutrient cycle. Cannabis is a pig man. You know it's so funny it's like we grew up talking to
[02:19:25.900 --> 02:19:31.420]  soil labs it was like oh I'm growing a tomato plant and they're like yeah yeah sure kid right.
[02:19:31.980 --> 02:19:36.620]  That was the code word and then sooner or later the labs all caught on to the fact that you know
[02:19:36.620 --> 02:19:42.300]  no we were actually growing cannabis. But bottom line is that the tomato plant like the cannabis
[02:19:42.300 --> 02:19:48.380]  plants are heavy feeders and if you do not have fungi in your system pushing nutrients to these
[02:19:48.380 --> 02:19:54.780]  guys then you're not going to hit your potential. So you know I've seen some papers saying that you
[02:19:54.780 --> 02:20:03.020]  know you can get higher THC in a bacterial. Show me the data. Like I don't believe that. I believe
[02:20:03.740 --> 02:20:10.300]  you know in my heart and soul the best smoke I ever had came out of Humble. And the reason why
[02:20:10.300 --> 02:20:17.660]  it was grown in thousand to one fungally dominant soil. You guys have the most incredible freaking
[02:20:17.660 --> 02:20:23.740]  soil not only with nutrients that clay that you hate. Fucking nutrient holder man the capacity
[02:20:23.740 --> 02:20:31.420]  the CEC capacity of your soil up there is insane. It's like down here in Oxnard. The soil is amazing.
[02:20:31.420 --> 02:20:37.500]  Doesn't drain well but the nutrient value is insane. So how do you get that nutrient out of there?
[02:20:38.060 --> 02:20:43.180]  Fungi right. That's your mycorrhizae. That's 50 percent of the fungal kingdom. The saprophytes
[02:20:43.420 --> 02:20:49.180]  are breaking down that organic matter as fast as they can and releasing that nutrient. Not only
[02:20:49.180 --> 02:20:57.420]  plants but also insects and insects are then growing out and dying. That whole web is you know
[02:20:57.420 --> 02:21:04.380]  is is incredible incredibly important. And so to say that the cannabis plant would do better in a
[02:21:04.380 --> 02:21:12.380]  bacterial or perhaps totally fungal. Again there's there's so much we're learning in not only the
[02:21:12.380 --> 02:21:18.620]  relationships of fungal to bacteria but the communities like reductionary science has gone
[02:21:18.620 --> 02:21:25.100]  on for years. Oh let's identify this bacteria. Well that bacteria is a blip in time and it could
[02:21:25.100 --> 02:21:31.740]  only be for one day. What came before it. What comes after it. What did it help promote in that
[02:21:31.740 --> 02:21:37.100]  system. And so it's really a matter of looking at communities and some of the genetic work that's
[02:21:37.100 --> 02:21:42.940]  coming out now bar coding to bar coding is looking at the whole community not at one specific
[02:21:42.940 --> 02:21:50.860]  species and breaking it down to the exact DNA strand. It's more looking at OK this is this has
[02:21:50.860 --> 02:21:56.860]  these pieces to its DNA. So chances are it's related to these other communities. And then the
[02:21:56.860 --> 02:22:01.820]  next step is really going to be looking at succession. So we all know about soil succession.
[02:22:01.820 --> 02:22:07.420]  Well there's a microbial succession too. And it's just as important. And it depends on where you are
[02:22:07.420 --> 02:22:13.260]  what season what time what's the moon what's the sun what's the moisture what's the prevailing
[02:22:13.260 --> 02:22:20.140]  wind. All of those things are affecting those communities. So yeah I'm a proponent of the more
[02:22:20.140 --> 02:22:26.860]  fungi you have in play the better you are off. And remember the higher fungal content you have
[02:22:26.860 --> 02:22:33.100]  the higher bacterial content you can have and still keep that F to B ratio in play. So there's
[02:22:33.100 --> 02:22:42.860]  my two cents on that one. Yeah. Appreciate that. That was nice. One thing I remember that I think
[02:22:42.860 --> 02:22:48.780]  it was Steve Cantwell said on one of the shows he said that you know he's on like run 20 or something
[02:22:48.780 --> 02:22:56.060]  in his living soils or 26. All right. When I lived out here he was on 17. So yeah he's 26. That's
[02:22:56.060 --> 02:23:01.420]  dope. I think one thing I remember him saying and I hope I'm not quoting him or saying it wrong is
[02:23:01.420 --> 02:23:09.340]  that he said that his beds have become bacteria dominant. He said and I'm pretty sure it was him
[02:23:09.340 --> 02:23:15.260]  he said he feels like that the cannabis has changed his soil to a bacterial dominant soil.
[02:23:15.260 --> 02:23:23.260]  Do you think that is more because of the with the cannabis being heavy feeders that maybe the
[02:23:23.260 --> 02:23:27.340]  fungi has been diminished and needs to be replenished or do you think that the
[02:23:27.340 --> 02:23:35.260]  plants actually change the soil profile that way. That's a hell of a question. You know at
[02:23:35.260 --> 02:23:40.860]  some point I hope that I do get a chance to go out and scope the soil and really look at what's going
[02:23:40.860 --> 02:23:49.100]  on. I had him on the show and I don't remember exactly whether we had that conversation or not.
[02:23:49.100 --> 02:23:55.420]  I know that they're knocking out of the park. I know that their smoke is amazing but I just don't
[02:23:55.420 --> 02:24:01.340]  know like what that level of fungi is. And you know another piece of this puzzle that
[02:24:01.900 --> 02:24:10.220]  is not talked about much and that is yeast and molds. They are also components of the fungal
[02:24:10.220 --> 02:24:16.300]  family. So just because you don't have the sap or you know the typical hyphy strand of you know
[02:24:16.300 --> 02:24:25.660]  multiple colored species you still could have a high presence of these other types of organisms
[02:24:25.660 --> 02:24:32.460]  that live in the fungal community that are providing that fungal service. So it gets deep
[02:24:32.460 --> 02:24:40.300]  too. It gets fucking deep as shit. Yeah I mean. Yeah has the cannabis plant moved that soil through
[02:24:40.300 --> 02:24:46.300]  succession? Absolutely. For sure. And he's definitely top dressing stuff. So maybe what
[02:24:46.300 --> 02:24:54.060]  he's top dressing does have some fungal components in it too. But until I actually look at it it
[02:24:54.060 --> 02:24:59.660]  would be hard for me to comment. Other than the fact I know he's busting out some hardcore smoke.
[02:25:00.460 --> 02:25:09.900]  Yes. Oh you see that comment? I didn't see that. Yeah I can side with that.
[02:25:09.900 --> 02:25:14.300]  People say that the healthy plant releases sugars for bacteria and extremely healthy plant
[02:25:14.300 --> 02:25:20.380]  releases peptides for fungi as well. And going back to the you know the um what was it that you said
[02:25:22.140 --> 02:25:28.220]  the yeast and whatnot. Yeah definitely. I'll sometimes add brewer's yeast into my mixes
[02:25:28.380 --> 02:25:33.500]  as well. It's extremely stress relieving as well. And going back to the ferments I would say they
[02:25:33.500 --> 02:25:37.740]  will go more vinegar or some get a little bit alcoholic. Well there's that yeast present in
[02:25:37.740 --> 02:25:43.260]  them as well. Oh yeah. The alcohol is the part of the process of going through vinegar. So yeah
[02:25:43.260 --> 02:25:49.100]  it goes through that alcohol fermentation stage. And I like a more yeastier dominant type of
[02:25:49.100 --> 02:25:55.500]  ferment. But yeah it's uh I do believe in my humble opinion that extremely healthy plants
[02:25:55.500 --> 02:25:59.980]  are fungal dominant. You could grow of course bacteria but fungal dominance is where you I think
[02:26:00.620 --> 02:26:05.100]  how I see it. When I when I feed my beds and it's more bacterial dominant I'll see four to five
[02:26:05.100 --> 02:26:10.860]  changes when I feed. When it's fungal dominant I'll see I'll see two three days within changes.
[02:26:10.860 --> 02:26:16.460]  So I see a quicker turnaround from my feeds with the fungal dominant than a bacterial dominant.
[02:26:16.460 --> 02:26:23.020]  What I've noticed. Well I bet you know making IMO is so I've already got that in there you know. I
[02:26:23.020 --> 02:26:27.420]  mean I'm already maxed out with my fungi and bacteria. I feel like it's a nice balance and
[02:26:27.420 --> 02:26:31.100]  the plants have it in there to do with it as they you know as they choose.
[02:26:35.020 --> 02:26:42.620]  What's the good old for all the listeners out there. Distillers waste. Distillers waste is an
[02:26:42.620 --> 02:26:52.300]  amazing source of biological foods. It's it's a nematode feast. And it's also providing a
[02:26:52.300 --> 02:26:57.820]  tremendous amount of nitrogen and feeding. Yes both the bacterial and fungal communities. So
[02:26:57.820 --> 02:27:01.980]  get as much of it as you can. Don't be a moron. Just a little bit at a time.
[02:27:01.980 --> 02:27:07.660]  Maybe a compost with it and it's you'll you'll have incredible benefits. So again those are
[02:27:07.660 --> 02:27:11.340]  those molds and those geese that are that are interacting with that material.
[02:27:13.340 --> 02:27:18.940]  That comment that was just up there that Mike had posted. Can you put that back up there Peter.
[02:27:18.940 --> 02:27:23.740]  That's really interesting because I was just reading about this in teaming with microbes
[02:27:23.740 --> 02:27:32.380]  where Jeff Lonefalls was talking about certain trees perennials that like bacterial dominant
[02:27:32.380 --> 02:27:37.500]  soil early in their life as they're getting established and then as they get get larger
[02:27:37.500 --> 02:27:42.300]  and into their first second third year they want a more fungally dominant soil.
[02:27:42.300 --> 02:27:47.740]  So that's interesting to think that. I think that's a yeah that's a big comment right there.
[02:27:48.540 --> 02:27:57.100]  Yeah. Everything is suppression right. Everything is moving forward or backward or in some direction.
[02:27:57.900 --> 02:28:02.940]  I love I love the early explanations of the soil food where Elaine takes you from a
[02:28:02.940 --> 02:28:07.580]  wetland or a hyper riparian system into an old growth forest and you're seeing all these
[02:28:07.580 --> 02:28:13.340]  transitions. What happens at the end of the old growth forest. Well either you know a volcano
[02:28:13.340 --> 02:28:19.180]  an earthquake a hurricane something knocks it down and it's a reset. And now all the rain turns
[02:28:19.180 --> 02:28:26.380]  into mud creates ponds swamps. Right. So everything is in succession one way or the other. And I think
[02:28:27.100 --> 02:28:33.100]  humans. Yeah. Circle is going to go to the end it's going to pick. Right. Right. And if we look
[02:28:33.100 --> 02:28:38.380]  at that we can learn a lot from it and apply those to our individual lives or growths.
[02:28:38.700 --> 02:28:39.740]  Yeah for sure.
[02:28:43.020 --> 02:28:49.980]  Great comment. There's there's a lot to this guys. These these ferments these you know J.DOM recipes
[02:28:51.260 --> 02:28:57.740]  K&F. There's just so much to it. And we're we need to tell more people about it so that so that
[02:28:57.740 --> 02:29:03.580]  others can can learn that they don't need to be reliant on bullshit. I think we lost the guys in
[02:29:03.660 --> 02:29:04.620]  They'll be back.
[02:29:05.660 --> 02:29:07.900]  And we did it the slot machines I think.
[02:29:09.900 --> 02:29:11.100]  Went for a dip in the pool.
[02:29:12.060 --> 02:29:13.100]  They're feeling lucky. Yeah.
[02:29:14.540 --> 02:29:17.820]  I guess they work better in a living soil with sandstone clay.
[02:29:19.340 --> 02:29:26.140]  Again those ferments are helping to build your biological system. There you are.
[02:29:26.940 --> 02:29:27.500]  We're back.
[02:29:28.460 --> 02:29:31.660]  We saw the vape. We saw the vape.
[02:29:35.660 --> 02:29:36.860]  You're looking for it.
[02:29:39.100 --> 02:29:43.420]  Well this is the first time I haven't talked to Brian on you guys. You guys see this.
[02:29:44.300 --> 02:29:48.940]  Yeah he's taking the day off man. Yeah. He's he's beach mode. He looks like he's ready for the
[02:29:48.940 --> 02:29:53.900]  pool. Yeah. He's he's ready for the pool. He's ready for the pool. He's ready for the pool.
[02:29:53.980 --> 02:29:57.340]  Yeah. He's he's beach mode. He looks like he's ready for the pool.
[02:29:58.300 --> 02:30:03.900]  Brian's learned a lesson I learned very early on which is just get out of the way and let the
[02:30:05.820 --> 02:30:08.380]  people who can dork out on a topic dork out.
[02:30:11.020 --> 02:30:12.460]  Keep them supplied with the weed.
[02:30:15.740 --> 02:30:19.340]  I don't know where we're at but I have one. I'll tell you late in.
[02:30:20.300 --> 02:30:25.980]  Just quickly do you see this last quote because we quickly mentioned kombucha dilution rates.
[02:30:26.780 --> 02:30:31.100]  I don't make kombucha so I'm gonna leave that to Tay and that. I don't do kombucha as well so.
[02:30:31.100 --> 02:30:36.140]  But I would just dilute it like vinegar if it was me. I would always start if I'm going to dilute
[02:30:36.140 --> 02:30:40.460]  anything I started like two milliliters with anything. That's my safe zone. Well mostly
[02:30:40.460 --> 02:30:43.900]  anything. If I'm gonna start with something it's like two milliliters. Per gallon. Per gallon
[02:30:43.900 --> 02:30:47.900]  correct. That if I'm going to start something new I always start at two. That's very light.
[02:30:48.700 --> 02:30:53.020]  From there I go up because a lot of the times you'd be amazed if you go to three what stuff
[02:30:53.020 --> 02:30:57.900]  would burn. You know what I mean because it's so extremely but two is where I start.
[02:30:57.900 --> 02:31:01.180]  Me personally anything any ferment or anything that I'm adding.
[02:31:02.300 --> 02:31:09.900]  I think that's a great great gold nugget right there. Slow and slow. Yeah two mils to a gallon
[02:31:09.900 --> 02:31:15.180]  you'll probably see something and if you don't then you can bump it a mil and see what happens.
[02:31:15.340 --> 02:31:23.340]  But most natural farming ferments are one to a thousand one to five hundred. So two
[02:31:23.340 --> 02:31:28.220]  mils to a gallon is probably not that far off of that. Anyway sorry Mark.
[02:31:30.220 --> 02:31:36.460]  No I was just going to ask something that seems like whenever I do because I do you know IMO
[02:31:36.460 --> 02:31:41.580]  like traditional methods keeping temperature temperature under 125 so we're not degrading
[02:31:41.580 --> 02:31:47.740]  those yeast and bacteria and fungi that we already kind of mentioned. Well that comment
[02:31:48.380 --> 02:31:55.980]  always pisses off people that make thermophilic compost you know. And my point is I'm telling
[02:31:55.980 --> 02:32:00.860]  them I'm not telling you thermophilic compost isn't good and I'm not telling you that.
[02:32:01.660 --> 02:32:07.900]  But what I am telling you is high heat will degrade the soil biology. Now do we agree on that?
[02:32:07.900 --> 02:32:15.820]  I think we do. All right so you guys I did a friend and I did what's called it was the first
[02:32:15.820 --> 02:32:25.500]  annual Ventura County compost cup. And we brought all these local compost maker heavy hitters look
[02:32:25.500 --> 02:32:30.860]  up agriment look up peach hill soil. These guys are no joke and they're running big operations.
[02:32:31.820 --> 02:32:39.020]  And a lot of other people we had a regenerative agricultural center up in Ojai come down. We had
[02:32:39.020 --> 02:32:46.540]  a whole bunch of intelligent people that are in the compost industry or making compost themselves.
[02:32:46.540 --> 02:32:53.180]  We brought all of these samples about 50 samples in. I weeded through them. I did the biology on
[02:32:53.180 --> 02:33:00.700]  them and we put these experts 10 judges in and we put out laid out saucers of the compost and
[02:33:00.700 --> 02:33:08.140]  had each one pick it up and judge it. At the end of the cup I basically just had a quick message
[02:33:08.140 --> 02:33:17.260]  and was like all right so you guys you judged this compost by what? You had no testing. You
[02:33:17.260 --> 02:33:26.540]  didn't take into consideration biology. You judged it based on its look. Like what is compost right?
[02:33:27.100 --> 02:33:33.740]  What is compost? And the conversation just went holy fuck I never thought of it that way.
[02:33:34.380 --> 02:33:39.420]  So and now the work I'm doing here with ground up organic matter you guys this is
[02:33:39.420 --> 02:33:43.660]  fucking a scary project. It's probably the scariest project I've ever dealt with in my life.
[02:33:44.460 --> 02:33:54.460]  There's going to be between 10 and 15 million tons of green waste and food waste. There's no
[02:33:54.460 --> 02:34:01.260]  longer allowed to go to landfills. It's going to have to be used. So they grind this stuff up and
[02:34:01.260 --> 02:34:09.180]  sell it as compost. As soon as you put it on the ground it kills it. The agriculture industry is
[02:34:09.180 --> 02:34:14.620]  now using it as a herbicide and when I first heard this I was horrified. I'm like what the
[02:34:14.620 --> 02:34:19.500]  fuck are they doing right? But then you start to think about the waste stream like this. This is
[02:34:19.500 --> 02:34:23.660]  just going to get more and more and more. It's not going to get less and less. How are you going
[02:34:23.660 --> 02:34:35.500]  to deal with 25 million yards of fucking material right? This is mind-blowing. So I'm in the process
[02:34:35.500 --> 02:34:43.660]  now trying to arrest the process because during the thermophilic process you're taking nitrogen,
[02:34:43.660 --> 02:34:50.620]  organic N that's in the soil and you're releasing it in an ammoniacal form, ammonia gas. You guys
[02:34:50.700 --> 02:34:54.860]  know what I'm talking about. Any commercial compost you walk up and all you smell is ammonia.
[02:34:54.860 --> 02:34:58.620]  If it's really bad you'll smell methane too. That's when it's gone anaerobic.
[02:34:59.180 --> 02:35:06.780]  So how do you hold these nutrients because ammonia and methane 10 times, 100 times worse than fucking
[02:35:06.780 --> 02:35:12.300]  CO2 and we're just burning it off in these giant piles and nobody's even talking about it.
[02:35:13.260 --> 02:35:22.060]  So how do you stop the thermophilic process and still make good compost right? So all of you
[02:35:22.060 --> 02:35:28.060]  thermophilic compost people don't hate on me because I understand what it does. You take it,
[02:35:28.060 --> 02:35:35.020]  you heat it up, you release those, unfortunately those organic nitrogen sources but you have to
[02:35:35.100 --> 02:35:42.380]  let that compost cool down and sit for six months to a year before it's going to recolonize with
[02:35:42.380 --> 02:35:46.860]  the indigenous organisms, the protozoa, the nematode, the fungi, the things that you want.
[02:35:47.660 --> 02:35:53.740]  You can't let millions of yards sit there for years. You've got to fucking get it out of here,
[02:35:53.740 --> 02:35:59.420]  like get it out on the ground. That shit is still valuable. If you till those carbon sources in,
[02:35:59.420 --> 02:36:04.140]  you're tilling in an organic nitrogen that will slowly release over time with the right
[02:36:04.140 --> 02:36:09.420]  bacterial communities or fungal communities. But you've got to deal with this and you've got to
[02:36:09.420 --> 02:36:16.620]  do something with it. So if you don't have time, then you can't go to thermophilic stage because
[02:36:16.620 --> 02:36:24.300]  that takes days, weeks. The only thing that they have to do is pathogen reduction. So they have to
[02:36:24.300 --> 02:36:29.500]  make sure that they kill the pathogens before they release this gum out into the market.
[02:36:30.220 --> 02:36:38.700]  And so we're like, all right, how quickly can you get through your pathogen reduction? And it's 50
[02:36:38.700 --> 02:36:46.140]  days in a turned pile in a windrow style. It's three days in the forced air. I forget what the
[02:36:46.140 --> 02:36:50.860]  name of it is right off the tip of my tongue, but it's basically they put in, they suck all the air
[02:36:50.860 --> 02:36:57.420]  through the compost and then they put it through a biofilter to get rid of the ammonia. And that
[02:36:57.500 --> 02:37:05.340]  one takes three days, but that's not what about fermentation tanks like the, yeah, don't worry.
[02:37:05.340 --> 02:37:10.540]  We're going to get into that. I'm fortunately working with this agra man who's about to build
[02:37:10.540 --> 02:37:17.180]  an 80 acre facility to start handling this. They're on a 10 acre facility right now. You guys,
[02:37:17.180 --> 02:37:22.700]  the mountains of Dom are insane. It's just the volume is like, where is it coming from? Is it
[02:37:22.700 --> 02:37:28.460]  just California municipal food waste? It's basically just yard waste. They haven't even
[02:37:29.180 --> 02:37:36.780]  deal with food waste yet. So it's just one guys cut their limbs and their grass and all that stuff
[02:37:36.780 --> 02:37:42.700]  can't go to the land market. It's horrifying. I landed here during COVID right. And I'm like,
[02:37:42.700 --> 02:37:48.540]  all right, I got here on the fourth. Now it's the sixth, the whole globe shut down. So we're all
[02:37:48.540 --> 02:37:54.780]  really what the fuck's going on. So I started looking around my area, pay attention that
[02:37:54.780 --> 02:38:01.420]  everybody's got these giant fucking with a green lid that they throw all of their organic matter.
[02:38:02.060 --> 02:38:08.140]  And every one of the people living here has one of these giant cans that are getting picked up by a
[02:38:08.140 --> 02:38:15.100]  fucking dump truck or a crusher or a compactor and getting hauled away. And I'm like, what the fuck
[02:38:15.100 --> 02:38:22.540]  are they doing here? All of that food waste should be staying on the property, chips put under your
[02:38:22.540 --> 02:38:27.900]  trees, your grass clipping, you shouldn't be taking the clippings away. They should be fucking
[02:38:27.900 --> 02:38:35.340]  mulch mode back into the soil. So California is destroying its oil, making incredible mountains
[02:38:35.340 --> 02:38:40.380]  of fucking green waste. And then saying, oh, we can't dump the green waste in landfill. So now
[02:38:40.380 --> 02:38:44.620]  what are we going to do with it? I mean, they're their own worst fucking nightmares. And they're
[02:38:44.620 --> 02:38:50.380]  not like the only country, the only state that is doing this with green waste. New England has
[02:38:50.380 --> 02:38:56.780]  green waste issues. But needless to say, what is compost guys, and that's that's a rabbit hole that
[02:38:57.420 --> 02:39:04.380]  I've meditated deeply on a number of for at least a year now of what is it and how is it used and
[02:39:05.020 --> 02:39:11.420]  it can be used in all different ways. But you're making something that should be used for something
[02:39:11.420 --> 02:39:19.740]  specific, not not a one answers all right, because, you know, ground up trees is a great mulch. But is
[02:39:19.740 --> 02:39:27.740]  it a great compost? No. Is it good for the nation? Sure. But we grow plants in just mulch. No, you
[02:39:27.740 --> 02:39:35.020]  can't. So now ground up trees and wood chips and that guard will thermal thermal real quick, I'm
[02:39:35.020 --> 02:39:40.220]  sure. Yeah, dude. Fuck yeah. You pile it up. It goes right back to one hundred thirty hundred
[02:39:40.220 --> 02:39:49.420]  forty hundred fifty. It's it's rocket fuel. So got some big problem guys. Yeah.
[02:39:49.980 --> 02:39:50.460]  Yeah.
[02:39:53.420 --> 02:39:56.460]  Smoking lots of weed at night and trying to figure it out. Good work.
[02:39:57.100 --> 02:40:01.100]  Keep educating us, you know, keep putting the word out there. It's all we can do, man.
[02:40:01.740 --> 02:40:07.260]  Yeah. Well, that's what I see microbes is doing to answer this question. They're using a lot of
[02:40:07.260 --> 02:40:11.740]  that fermented grain, that grain waste, and they're making, you know, Bokashi out of and
[02:40:11.740 --> 02:40:17.820]  what beer Kashi. Oh, yeah. That's why his bio vast is high in nematodes. If you look at the testing.
[02:40:17.820 --> 02:40:22.620]  Yeah. Just like Leighton said earlier, it's a haven for nematodes. And that's why he's got he's
[02:40:22.620 --> 02:40:26.540]  got half populations in his bio vast. Yeah. But more people probably should be hitting these
[02:40:26.540 --> 02:40:30.780]  people up like, hey, let me get some of your spent grains. Right. Right. I do it like I got
[02:40:30.780 --> 02:40:36.780]  to deal with local to local bakeries and a little salad shop just in my little community. And I get
[02:40:37.820 --> 02:40:43.580]  about 30 gallon barrel a week. And it's like all just salad scraps. And, you know,
[02:40:43.580 --> 02:40:48.460]  might be a plastic glove in there when a dude threw it in there. But I got other than that. I
[02:40:48.460 --> 02:40:53.900]  mean, that's all stuff I take out and I read, you know, rework and compost and then I use it back
[02:40:53.900 --> 02:40:58.220]  on my property. So it's free organic material. You know, if you just want to put a little effort
[02:40:58.220 --> 02:41:05.500]  in going to pick it up. Yeah. Another trick I learned is that distillers waste is actually
[02:41:05.500 --> 02:41:09.820]  better than brewers waste. So keep that in mind as well. Not that brewers waste is bad. It is.
[02:41:09.820 --> 02:41:16.940]  Don't get me wrong. But the distillers waste doesn't have the fuck. What is it? Rye, I think,
[02:41:16.940 --> 02:41:24.140]  is is also like a bio side. There's some interesting hops. Yeah. Hops is a bio side,
[02:41:24.140 --> 02:41:30.540]  so it can knock back your diversity in your biological communities. So if you only have
[02:41:30.540 --> 02:41:36.780]  brewers waste, use it blended properly. Don't use it. You know too much of it. It's a high nitrogen
[02:41:36.780 --> 02:41:41.980]  source. You should be should not be using more than 10 percent of that by volume to your greens
[02:41:41.980 --> 02:41:47.980]  and browns. And don't be in a hurry with it. You know, if you get it and pile it up, let it sit
[02:41:47.980 --> 02:41:51.980]  like, you know, two, three months, then start working with it and messing with it. You don't
[02:41:51.980 --> 02:41:56.700]  have to take these things straight out the brewery and start putting them in your garden. You know,
[02:41:56.700 --> 02:42:02.460]  there's a process to it and you want to inoculate it properly. You know, let it you don't want to
[02:42:02.460 --> 02:42:10.300]  burn up your stuff trying to be doing something good. Low and slow, just like barbecue.
[02:42:13.820 --> 02:42:20.540]  No, I've seen for these guys because I definitely have to roll out of here at three o'clock. I got
[02:42:20.540 --> 02:42:25.740]  to go get my hair cut. I'm flying back to marry my daughter, guys. My oldest. Congratulations.
[02:42:26.700 --> 02:42:29.180]  Congrats, man. Or where are you getting married?
[02:42:29.900 --> 02:42:35.180]  Yes, she's getting married in Ipswich, Mass. So I'm flying in. I leave tomorrow morning.
[02:42:35.900 --> 02:42:40.380]  The wedding's on Saturday. So I get to see my kids who I haven't seen in two and a half
[02:42:40.380 --> 02:42:46.060]  fucking years because of covid and all this other insanity. And I get to see my family,
[02:42:46.060 --> 02:42:51.740]  my sister, some of my dear friends. So I'm really excited for this trip. But I got to
[02:42:51.820 --> 02:42:59.820]  get my shit together. I'm being packed. I got a gun. I have a question just kind of on the
[02:42:59.820 --> 02:43:05.660]  one we're talking about all the municipal yard waste and stuff kind of what's like. I would
[02:43:05.660 --> 02:43:14.140]  never want to use that to grow plants that I'm eating. But what's kind of a logical use for it?
[02:43:14.220 --> 02:43:21.580]  Like, okay, so Peter, it's yard waste. So if you're using compost, you're using the same
[02:43:21.580 --> 02:43:25.820]  thing. Now, if you want to get fucking horrified, there's a stuff called dirty
[02:43:25.820 --> 02:43:33.660]  Murph. So dirty Murph is where they're taking trash that nobody cares about recycling. So
[02:43:33.660 --> 02:43:37.900]  these are humans that just don't give a fuck. And they just throw everything in the same bin.
[02:43:37.900 --> 02:43:44.380]  Right. And so that has to go to the landfill. And so this has to be dealt with. So they're
[02:43:44.380 --> 02:43:50.460]  taking this dirty Murph and there's batteries, there's plastic, there's chemicals, you know,
[02:43:50.460 --> 02:43:54.780]  you clean out underneath your sink and you throw your Clorox and your fucking scrubbers and all
[02:43:54.780 --> 02:44:00.540]  that shit in the trash can. Well, somebody has to fucking deal with it. So now these dudes,
[02:44:00.540 --> 02:44:06.540]  like tried to spread dirty Murph in agriculture. This is horrifying, guys, like the agricultural
[02:44:06.540 --> 02:44:13.100]  industry will take this stuff for free because it has some carbon in it, some value. They don't
[02:44:13.100 --> 02:44:18.140]  care that they're growing plants and battery acid, fucking Clorox and all this other shit.
[02:44:18.140 --> 02:44:22.860]  They don't fucking care about your health. They're just trying to get their growth then out the door
[02:44:22.860 --> 02:44:27.420]  and sell it and make some money. So there's this company that came in and was like, all right,
[02:44:27.420 --> 02:44:32.300]  how are we going to deal with this dirty Murph shit? And they set up separators and, you know,
[02:44:32.700 --> 02:44:37.340]  they process it and then try to pull the plastic and the metal out with magnets and all this crazy
[02:44:37.340 --> 02:44:44.060]  shit. Well, it don't fucking work so well. So then they're like, oh, let's pulverize it. Let's just
[02:44:44.060 --> 02:44:52.700]  fucking pulverize the shit into dust. So you talk about microplastics, micro metal chips,
[02:44:53.420 --> 02:44:57.340]  and now they want to spread that shit on the fucking agricultural fields.
[02:44:57.340 --> 02:45:02.860]  I would not eat something that was grown in that. But green waste. I'm sorry, guys,
[02:45:02.860 --> 02:45:09.180]  that green waste is still a viable source of carbon and nutrients that you can grow plants in.
[02:45:09.740 --> 02:45:15.740]  How healthy is it? Well, you know, I don't know what to fucking tell you.
[02:45:15.740 --> 02:45:19.660]  You know, we got to use it somewhere. We can't we can't just keep burying. We can't just.
[02:45:20.460 --> 02:45:25.020]  And that's my point. So in your opinion, what's the best use for it? Because I was alluding to
[02:45:25.020 --> 02:45:31.660]  kind of what these people were mentioning in the chat, like if my neighbor is spraying Roundup all
[02:45:31.660 --> 02:45:38.060]  over their yard and other pesticides and then all that stuff's being pulled out like is there a way
[02:45:38.060 --> 02:45:44.220]  to bioremediate it? Like, could you send it to the worms and break it down or?
[02:45:45.100 --> 02:45:50.860]  Put it in the soil. Look, there's bacteria that are that are cracking the Roundup code because
[02:45:50.860 --> 02:45:57.500]  it's so prevalent right now. Roundup is everywhere. Now they have to use Roundup 5X because the old
[02:45:57.500 --> 02:46:04.540]  Roundup won't kill plants because they're tolerant to it now. So there's bacteria that's busting it
[02:46:04.540 --> 02:46:10.700]  up. So it's just a matter of getting it, blending it back into the soil. We're all breathing unhealthy
[02:46:10.700 --> 02:46:16.300]  air. We're all drinking horrible water. We're all eating horrible fucking food. How much worse can
[02:46:16.300 --> 02:46:21.420]  we fucking make it? Right. And I think that's where you got to get off your fucking high horse
[02:46:21.420 --> 02:46:27.420]  and be like, oh, I only eat organic. You think it's organic? It's got an organic stamp from China
[02:46:27.420 --> 02:46:31.820]  or Mexico. Yeah. Good luck with that one, man. You know, I'm sorry.
[02:46:33.500 --> 02:46:40.060]  Money grab and a fucking game. But bottom line is that each and every person should be looking at
[02:46:40.060 --> 02:46:46.220]  what they're putting in that green barrel instead of having their landscaper use a bag collecting
[02:46:46.220 --> 02:46:52.460]  mower. Ask your landscaper to get a mulch mower. Put this shit back into your soil. Ask him to take
[02:46:52.460 --> 02:46:57.660]  all the prunings from your trimmings and grind them up with a little grinder and put it underneath
[02:46:57.660 --> 02:47:03.500]  the fucking trees instead of putting it in your can. You can do this, people. But, you know,
[02:47:03.500 --> 02:47:09.180]  that's the way to solve the problem is stop putting it in fucking cans. But until they stop putting it
[02:47:09.180 --> 02:47:15.020]  in cans, we got to do something with it. It's adding carbon. It's adding biological foods. Sure,
[02:47:15.020 --> 02:47:21.260]  it's adding toxins and other shit to the soil, but they're already fucking there. So, you know,
[02:47:21.260 --> 02:47:27.820]  again, we have to start dealing with these things with a more open mind and less. Oh, I'm this or
[02:47:27.820 --> 02:47:34.460]  I'm that. You know, let's let's all come together as a fucking species and stop trying to fucking
[02:47:34.460 --> 02:47:40.380]  isolate each other. I do. If I cut you, you bleed red. You're a fucking brother or sister. I don't
[02:47:40.380 --> 02:47:45.500]  care where the fuck you come from or whatever the fuck you breathe. Believe it. We're all fucking
[02:47:45.500 --> 02:47:49.900]  humans and we better get our shit together now or we'll just keep walking along this trail,
[02:47:49.900 --> 02:47:57.660]  skipping to oblivion. Yeah, that was my answer today. We're going to do it. Yeah, I'm greedy.
[02:47:58.620 --> 02:48:02.780]  Beautifully said, brother. I got a little passionate, too.
[02:48:03.900 --> 02:48:08.300]  No, it's good. I felt it over here.
[02:48:13.020 --> 02:48:17.740]  Were there any questions, Peter, that you want to have? And listen, I can bounce and you guys
[02:48:17.740 --> 02:48:23.740]  can stay on and talk as long as Peter will allow you. That's for sure. Yeah. Hey, I would think
[02:48:23.740 --> 02:48:28.460]  if you could mix that with wood chips and make really good hot thermophilic compost, could you
[02:48:29.100 --> 02:48:34.140]  do John Payne style hot water heating? Could you do methane digesters?
[02:48:37.580 --> 02:48:44.940]  The biggest problem is time. So there is no time for any of this. And so, yeah, there's all these
[02:48:44.940 --> 02:48:51.100]  wonderful things that can be done with it. And it does heat up very, very quickly. But you'd have
[02:48:51.100 --> 02:48:57.180]  to see the operation. I'll post up some pictures of these grinders. They look like tanks on
[02:48:57.180 --> 02:49:03.340]  steroids and they're building fucking mountains of the shit. They're tub grinders. They just throw
[02:49:03.340 --> 02:49:08.380]  in trees. They throw in pallets. They throw in wood scraps. They throw in green waste, the lawn
[02:49:08.380 --> 02:49:15.420]  waste chips. You know, this guy mowed this whole field down. He's raspberry bushes. Oh, they mowed
[02:49:15.420 --> 02:49:20.620]  down this lemon orchard. Now that's all lemon orchard trees. It's just everything. And it's
[02:49:20.700 --> 02:49:27.900]  just getting ground up into this two inch minus shit that is, we nicknamed GOM, ground up organic
[02:49:27.900 --> 02:49:32.780]  material. And that's that. So you don't know what it is. You have no idea what the pH is.
[02:49:32.780 --> 02:49:39.100]  It changes seasonally. And then I have this guy, this mix master, Dave Green, that I'm working with
[02:49:39.100 --> 02:49:46.300]  who understands what the feedstocks are and how to blend them together after it's been processed
[02:49:46.300 --> 02:49:52.220]  to try to get that pH into range. But as this shit breaks down, the pH goes up or towards
[02:49:52.220 --> 02:49:57.740]  alkalinity. But then when they get a whole bunch of lemon trees in the fucking shit is three. Oh,
[02:49:58.380 --> 02:50:08.060]  so it's a logistical fucking monster what these guys are doing. And I salute them. And I'm there
[02:50:08.060 --> 02:50:13.420]  to help them in any fucking way I can. And yes, we're talking about arresting it. We're talking
[02:50:13.420 --> 02:50:19.340]  about using waste streams like pit moss, my buddy fish brew, starting fish ponds out here and
[02:50:19.340 --> 02:50:25.580]  starting to introduce the biology back to the stabilized or arrested thermophytic GOM just to
[02:50:25.580 --> 02:50:32.300]  put more things into play in nature. Because yeah, GOM can still be a vehicle to transporting
[02:50:33.100 --> 02:50:38.940]  indigenous microorganisms or beneficial organisms or EMs or any of these other things if you can
[02:50:38.940 --> 02:50:44.940]  arrest it so it doesn't go to over 120. Because like Marco said, as soon as you go over 120,
[02:50:44.940 --> 02:50:50.460]  you lose diversity. And it takes a long time for that diversity to come back. So if you can arrest
[02:50:50.460 --> 02:50:57.580]  it and shut it down, and then impregnated or inoculate it and then put it out on the ground,
[02:50:57.580 --> 02:51:03.820]  now you got something that's worthwhile. That's what I'm here to do is try to proof this so that
[02:51:03.820 --> 02:51:09.420]  instead of paying the farmer to take the shit, the farmer could actually pay $2 a yard and the
[02:51:09.420 --> 02:51:15.500]  health offset the cost of getting all these inoculants. And the landscapers, they pay $35
[02:51:15.500 --> 02:51:20.860]  a yard for that shit. It smells like ammonia and kills plants. Listen to this. This is no fucking
[02:51:20.860 --> 02:51:26.700]  joke. So the homeowners go to Home Depot, they buy a plant for $25, a little tree, right? Comes
[02:51:26.700 --> 02:51:33.340]  with a one year guarantee. Landscaper goes buys $35 a yard for the compost, plants the tree in it,
[02:51:33.340 --> 02:51:38.540]  and the tree fucking dies, right? So the homeowner calls Home Depot, hey, I want a replacement tree.
[02:51:38.540 --> 02:51:42.780]  Home Depot is sure, come on over and get it. By the time they plant that second tree,
[02:51:43.340 --> 02:51:49.260]  the GOM is stabilized. And now it's actually a beneficial. So these are the kinds of things that
[02:51:50.380 --> 02:51:55.500]  we're up against as to how to use this so that we stop that. Think of the carbon footprint of
[02:51:55.500 --> 02:52:01.420]  replacing that tree, right? And all of the shit that went into that, that now the landscaper
[02:52:01.420 --> 02:52:09.260]  could pay $2 a yard for this shit. And he could charge the client $35 a yard. And it grows shit.
[02:52:09.900 --> 02:52:14.860]  Right now the landscaper just made a huge profit at the end of the day, instead of being
[02:52:14.860 --> 02:52:20.620]  fucking forced to live on nothing because nobody wants to pay for landscaping. So those are the
[02:52:20.620 --> 02:52:25.580]  kinds of things that the positive things that can come out of this. If I can figure out how to
[02:52:25.580 --> 02:52:30.540]  fucking do it. I got a clue, guys. I got a clue. I've got an experiment going right now. And I'm
[02:52:30.540 --> 02:52:37.100]  going to start doing it on scale as soon as I get back. And I'll keep you posted as to the progress.
[02:52:37.100 --> 02:52:38.780]  Black soldier flies for the win.
[02:52:39.740 --> 02:52:40.380]  There you go.
[02:52:43.740 --> 02:52:50.220]  Yeah. And I have tons of them in my composter. And I've been, my kids love them too. My wife
[02:52:50.220 --> 02:52:55.660]  hates them. They're awesome. Because they crawl. I've told this before, but like,
[02:52:56.300 --> 02:53:00.540]  they crawl, you know, when, when they're done eating and they're ready to turn into the adults,
[02:53:00.540 --> 02:53:05.660]  they'll, they'll crawl out of the bin. And then a lot of them will make their way like under the
[02:53:05.660 --> 02:53:11.660]  cracks of the house and then somehow find their way into the basement. So I have every day I'm
[02:53:11.660 --> 02:53:18.860]  picking a couple larva that are kind of like scooching along the basement. And now my kids
[02:53:18.860 --> 02:53:25.580]  help me and they know they're not bad. And then we do like catch and release. We bring them outside.
[02:53:26.540 --> 02:53:34.060]  And, but no, they're awesome. And then I have worms. But late, and I want to, I want to, at
[02:53:34.060 --> 02:53:42.220]  some point when we maybe next get together, test my worm castings and then also test my, because I
[02:53:42.220 --> 02:53:48.620]  don't, I put all my food waste into a big, you know, double 55 gallon tumbler. So I have two
[02:53:48.620 --> 02:53:58.460]  55 gallon tumblers and, and I want to test it. That's all, that's all I use in my garden is just.
[02:53:58.460 --> 02:54:02.860]  Well, from the pictures I've been seeing, dude, you're doing a great job. You know,
[02:54:02.860 --> 02:54:04.460]  your garden is fantastic.
[02:54:05.500 --> 02:54:13.660]  And my, I actually, they were just chopping a tree down, one of the neighbors. And every time
[02:54:13.660 --> 02:54:17.740]  that happens, I'll go to the guys who are doing it and I'll have all these bins with me and be
[02:54:17.740 --> 02:54:21.740]  like, can I take some of those wood chips? And they'll just be kind of confused and be like,
[02:54:21.740 --> 02:54:26.460]  okay. So I just got a restock of wood chips yesterday.
[02:54:27.420 --> 02:54:33.900]  Peter, you're a fucking hero. If everybody did that, there would be no gum to deal with. Right?
[02:54:34.460 --> 02:54:34.940]  That's right.
[02:54:35.580 --> 02:54:37.020]  Put it back in play locally.
[02:54:38.780 --> 02:54:40.780]  Yeah, no, that's where education comes in.
[02:54:44.460 --> 02:54:45.580]  Amen. Well,
[02:54:45.660 --> 02:54:54.380]  well, actually, so, uh, Craig from Alpenglow, if I, if I translated his question accurately,
[02:54:55.020 --> 02:54:59.500]  his question was how much weed are you bringing back to the East coast with me? My question is,
[02:54:59.500 --> 02:55:02.780]  who's your weed hookup in, uh, in Ipswich?
[02:55:05.020 --> 02:55:10.540]  Actually, you know, it's funny. Um, I'm, I'm not going to bring it back with me personally,
[02:55:10.540 --> 02:55:17.100]  but there will be some there that I know is clean, organic, regenerative. Um, but I was almost
[02:55:17.100 --> 02:55:21.580]  going to post up something on Instagram saying, Hey, any of you, New Hampshire or Vermont people
[02:55:21.580 --> 02:55:26.940]  or Maine people, you want to meet me somewhere? Like, so I can get some stuff for, for the party
[02:55:26.940 --> 02:55:31.900]  or for the, uh, for the wedding party, but I haven't done it yet, but I was definitely thinking
[02:55:31.900 --> 02:55:36.940]  about it. And I've, I've have reached out to a couple of, um, growers that I know that, uh,
[02:55:36.940 --> 02:55:42.540]  will hook me up if I actually need some. So, and, and Craig, man, much love to you, brother.
[02:55:42.540 --> 02:55:46.380]  We're going to have you on the show one of these weeks when, when things calm down up North and
[02:55:46.940 --> 02:55:51.580]  you and your lovely bride can get on because we love the husband wife teams that are
[02:55:51.580 --> 02:55:57.580]  doing this great work out there. Yeah. I was trying to plan a, uh,
[02:55:57.580 --> 02:56:02.780]  a morning garden tour with him when his, uh, wifi reception improves.
[02:56:03.660 --> 02:56:08.380]  Yes. Yeah. It's tough up there on the Hill. Um, but I'll, I'll be up to see you this fall,
[02:56:08.380 --> 02:56:12.140]  brother. I love to go up to humble and do my loop, you know, and see all the peeps up there
[02:56:13.180 --> 02:56:17.340]  during harvest time. Give me a hand. So I'll see him. I'll see him one way or another.
[02:56:18.460 --> 02:56:21.260]  Well, so have you got to go? Maybe we can go a little longer.
[02:56:23.820 --> 02:56:31.100]  Craig is still watching. Yeah. I was going to say anybody watching. So there you go. We got
[02:56:31.100 --> 02:56:37.980]  some people watching from the area. So, uh, Joseph is, uh, maybe hopefully right across the,
[02:56:37.980 --> 02:56:45.180]  uh, New Hampshire border. Oh, nice. Thank you. You can do so I can give it to my family there.
[02:56:45.180 --> 02:56:49.260]  Um, cause I won't bring it back with me. Well, do you want me to post the address
[02:56:49.260 --> 02:56:50.940]  of the wedding venue and people can just,
[02:56:54.060 --> 02:56:59.260]  well, this is the COVID friendly wedding. Like it's just him. Like,
[02:56:59.580 --> 02:57:04.620]  and I'm probably the one that they're all scared of because I'm flying in, but pretty much
[02:57:04.620 --> 02:57:10.540]  everybody else is just locally there. And so, but tell him to hit me up on IgE, give me a DM and
[02:57:10.540 --> 02:57:15.580]  I'll definitely connect with you because you know, those guys, uh, my family and friends that do
[02:57:15.580 --> 02:57:21.820]  smoke, we can't get the level of quality that, that I'm just so used to having all around me
[02:57:21.820 --> 02:57:27.980]  because of, you know, the people that know that are in the region world and love to share, you
[02:57:27.980 --> 02:57:36.140]  know, so thank you. Joseph, he's a kingdom aqua. If you just search Layton Morrison on Instagram,
[02:57:36.140 --> 02:57:41.100]  you can DM him or kingdom aquaponics. Yeah. That's usually the thing I want, but
[02:57:42.940 --> 02:57:46.940]  all right. Well, Brian, I'm sorry. We didn't get to talk today, brother. First time in a year.
[02:57:47.740 --> 02:57:53.980]  Well, no, we, um, I had set this up obviously with Marco, uh, then some things came to fruition.
[02:57:53.980 --> 02:57:59.420]  K and F hit me up, said he was in town. I know that it's pretty rare to get these kind of minds
[02:57:59.420 --> 02:58:04.140]  all together with Joey and yourself. So I wanted to take myself out of it this week and kind of
[02:58:04.140 --> 02:58:09.580]  just give the viewers a four fantastic viewpoints. Uh, and I look forward to going back in and
[02:58:09.580 --> 02:58:15.900]  watching this one again. Yeah. Awesome. Well, Marco and Joey, thank you guys so much for hopping on
[02:58:15.900 --> 02:58:21.980]  and deep respect and love for you guys. I mean, you're doing amazing work, man. And I, I wish there
[02:58:21.980 --> 02:58:27.020]  was a thousand more of you guys out there doing this, you know, and pushing these, these important
[02:58:27.020 --> 02:58:32.220]  things. You don't need to buy nothing, man. You don't need to buy anything. You can make everything
[02:58:32.220 --> 02:58:37.580]  yourself and grow an amazing medicine or food for yourself and your family. And you know, these,
[02:58:37.580 --> 02:58:43.020]  these, these are the places to find it. And guys like you are doing the work and helping get the
[02:58:43.020 --> 02:58:47.980]  word out. So deep respect and much love for you guys. Hey, back at you, Lee and much respect,
[02:58:47.980 --> 02:58:54.700]  brother. And, uh, enjoy that wedding, man. Seeing your little baby girl. That's crazy.
[02:58:55.980 --> 02:58:59.420]  Remember that little baby. Don't you? I know you do. Right. Right.
[02:59:01.180 --> 02:59:03.900]  I ain't going to get you teared up, man. I'm gonna let it go with that.
[02:59:06.140 --> 02:59:10.220]  Hey, and Joey, we really appreciate it, man. I know you've, uh, you know, like we had mentioned
[02:59:10.220 --> 02:59:15.100]  at the beginning of this, uh, podcast, there's a reason why so many people want to pick your brain
[02:59:15.100 --> 02:59:19.660]  and have you on their show. And, uh, again, man, you just exemplify what I feel like a lot of us
[02:59:19.660 --> 02:59:25.180]  aspire to be. Uh, and we're proud that we can put you on the platform today and continue getting
[02:59:25.180 --> 02:59:31.020]  your word out there as well as ours. Yeah. Your word is incredible. And again, such deep respect
[02:59:31.020 --> 02:59:36.620]  for your work. Yeah. Thanks for all those kind of words. And yeah, it's mutual respect with all of
[02:59:36.620 --> 02:59:42.380]  you. And just thank you so much for getting the word out about these practices. And it's really,
[02:59:42.860 --> 02:59:47.180]  really, what's going to transform our, not just our ganja, but our whole food system. So,
[02:59:47.180 --> 02:59:53.740]  yep. And you know, it's really cool. Um, and I got to fly, but Peter, let it roll for a minute.
[02:59:53.740 --> 02:59:58.620]  And Joey watched the comments. Where are you all people from, man? Let us know where you're
[02:59:58.620 --> 03:00:02.860]  called, where you're listening from. And this is going to pop your court, man. They're just all
[03:00:02.860 --> 03:00:09.820]  over the world, all over the world. How are you guys? Deep love, deep respect. I'll catch you
[03:00:09.820 --> 03:00:15.500]  guys next Thursday. Yeah, we got, um, we're having a Bart from Paonia soil. He's going to
[03:00:15.500 --> 03:00:20.300]  come on the show and kind of talk more about commercial farming. Uh, when we were out in
[03:00:20.300 --> 03:00:26.780]  Oklahoma, unfortunately, uh, some of the farms out there were buying bag soil, maybe some soil
[03:00:26.780 --> 03:00:31.180]  from larger facilities, that kind of stuff. And they've been having horrific issues with that.
[03:00:31.180 --> 03:00:36.460]  Uh, so we wanted to talk to a soil, a farmer at that same level. And we're going to talk to Bart
[03:00:36.460 --> 03:00:42.140]  about what it really takes to create, uh, you know, a bag soil, if you will, especially in the
[03:00:42.140 --> 03:00:48.060]  larger totes that, that some companies are buying. How do you make that as consistent as possible?
[03:00:48.060 --> 03:00:54.140]  Cause that's the real dirty secret of that part of the industry is it's very hard to eliminate
[03:00:54.140 --> 03:00:59.820]  certain pests and disease. And it's also extremely hard to be consistent at that level. Uh, so I'll
[03:00:59.820 --> 03:01:05.660]  be excited to, for us to, you know, chop it up with him next week. Nice, nice, great soil
[03:01:05.660 --> 03:01:10.380]  conversation. Looking forward to it. All right, guys, I'm out of here. Much love and respect.
[03:01:10.380 --> 03:01:15.500]  Catch you on next Thursday. Peace, brother. Yeah. Thanks again, Joey. Live from Vegas,
[03:01:15.500 --> 03:01:20.460]  everybody. Shout out to K and F Mr. Marco. Appreciate it. Take care of man. Pretty,
[03:01:21.020 --> 03:01:25.180]  pretty proud that all of us get to do all this. Uh, shout out to loyalty cannabis.
[03:01:25.180 --> 03:01:28.140]  Unfortunately he wasn't able to make it, but that dude is a homie. So,
[03:01:28.700 --> 03:01:34.300]  uh, shout out to you as well, brother. Um, anything else, Layton or, um, sorry, anything else, uh,
[03:01:34.300 --> 03:01:41.420]  Peter? Yeah, we got a couple, um, but, but, but yeah, I think Chad's on Chad this Saturday,
[03:01:41.420 --> 03:01:48.620]  I believe we're on. Uh, but also there are a couple, uh, fundraisers going on right now on
[03:01:48.620 --> 03:01:56.540]  the dagger love website. So one's for Mr. Toad health related. One is for Cecil C. Crab tree,
[03:01:57.260 --> 03:02:04.780]  law enforcement related. And then we're about to go live, uh, with kind of fire relief stuff with
[03:02:09.200 --> 03:02:21.760]  that's all seeds. So, yeah. But, uh, so there are going to be three currently and the fire relief
[03:02:21.760 --> 03:02:28.080]  one kind of the here, let me just kill that for a second. Um, just cause there are fires going on
[03:02:28.080 --> 03:02:34.640]  all over the place. Um, like what, what County is the, uh, Dixie fire in what's the name of that
[03:02:34.640 --> 03:02:41.440]  County that I'd never heard of Joey. This is a question for you. Who's the closest to that fire,
[03:02:42.480 --> 03:02:48.000]  but you know what I'm talking, it's like a County I'd never heard of. Yeah. The closest fires to me
[03:02:48.000 --> 03:02:54.240]  right now are over in Trinity County. So, um, but anyway, I think conceptually conceptually,
[03:02:54.240 --> 03:02:59.680]  the idea is to get this stuff up, convert it to cash, and then just start sending it to like
[03:03:00.320 --> 03:03:07.040]  various food banks that are helping people in different areas. And in the background, people
[03:03:07.040 --> 03:03:13.040]  are vetting food banks and other organizations to be like, okay, cool. These guys are doing a great
[03:03:13.040 --> 03:03:17.360]  job. They have a good reputation. Let's just get them money on the front lines to feed people.
[03:03:18.080 --> 03:03:27.200]  Um, but so there, the, the Tony one's up, uh, the, uh, Cecil C crab tree one's up. And then,
[03:03:27.200 --> 03:03:33.120]  uh, either today or tomorrow, I'm going to get the fire one up and breeders are sending
[03:03:33.120 --> 03:03:37.760]  or have sense and are sending in seat. That's actually, these are seed packs right here, but,
[03:03:37.840 --> 03:03:48.960]  uh, anyway, uh, the fundraisers, um, Chad, did you confirm that your chat? Yes, there is Chad.
[03:03:50.320 --> 03:03:55.920]  Chad, where are you this Saturday at 2 PM? West coast talking cannabis and the medical system
[03:03:55.920 --> 03:04:04.320]  with Nat Z. Uh, so anyway, that's Saturday, Joey, we appreciate your, can we get, uh,
[03:04:05.280 --> 03:04:11.200]  uh, for those who also, uh, respect your style, can, can you stand up a little bit
[03:04:11.200 --> 03:04:22.000]  so we can see the tank top and full festival where you always gotta be ready to run into the bushes
[03:04:22.000 --> 03:04:31.520]  too. So you never know when you're going to have to go hide in a clover. Yeah. So, um,
[03:04:32.480 --> 03:04:38.160]  but yeah, thanks again, everyone having me on it. Uh, it's awesome. You run all these
[03:04:38.160 --> 03:04:42.240]  fundraisers, helping all these people and yeah, just big up all the work they'll do.
[03:04:44.080 --> 03:04:49.520]  All right. So, and Brian, you said next week we have a pay on ya. Yeah. Bart with pay on
[03:04:50.560 --> 03:04:55.840]  random question for you guys, just cause I'm growing a comfrey out right now. Uh,
[03:04:56.720 --> 03:05:01.440]  is there something about like, I know Bakken 14 is known for its kind of
[03:05:01.440 --> 03:05:06.880]  high nutritional value, but does it not seed out? Like, can you only,
[03:05:08.720 --> 03:05:12.640]  cause I want to basically the reason I'm growing it out is to make seeds and then
[03:05:12.640 --> 03:05:16.800]  just give seeds out to people. So I'm just growing like a different type of comfrey.
[03:05:17.520 --> 03:05:25.520]  Um, well, Bakken 14 seeds are sterile, common true comfrey can make seeds that you can spread
[03:05:26.080 --> 03:05:32.320]  and they'll spread all over your property. So if you want to keep it compact, Bakken 14,
[03:05:32.320 --> 03:05:36.800]  if you want comfrey everywhere, go. He literally means everywhere, everywhere.
[03:05:36.800 --> 03:05:42.080]  Yeah. You were talking about East coast. Yeah. I mean, it's still a good deal and it's not going
[03:05:42.080 --> 03:05:48.560]  to go too far. Like if you were doing ferments and stuff, you, it'd be a regular comfrey would
[03:05:48.560 --> 03:05:55.040]  be good as well. That'd be fine. Yeah, definitely. Okay. And are you, are you implying that it's kind
[03:05:55.040 --> 03:06:01.840]  of an invasive species or a, it'll spread by the seed. So it can just start popping up in random
[03:06:01.840 --> 03:06:08.000]  places all over your property. Um, it's not, I mean, it's nothing you couldn't dig up or cut
[03:06:08.000 --> 03:06:15.120]  down, but, um, if you just want a true to Bakken 14, it just spreads by root only. You propagate
[03:06:15.120 --> 03:06:18.960]  it by root and you don't have to worry about it. Wherever you put it, it just clumps up right
[03:06:18.960 --> 03:06:26.320]  there. That's the preferred one for most folks. Right. Got it. Yeah. It can spread a little bit.
[03:06:26.320 --> 03:06:30.960]  If you were to like run near it with a tiller, little pieces of that root will get cut up or
[03:06:30.960 --> 03:06:35.360]  little pieces of it. It'll spread around like that, but it's easy to contain. And it's such
[03:06:35.360 --> 03:06:40.480]  an amazing plant. It's such an incredible biomass producer. You can just chop and drop it. Incredible
[03:06:40.480 --> 03:06:44.640]  way to build soil. Definitely recommend everybody have comfrey in their garden.
[03:06:45.200 --> 03:06:49.840]  Deer do like to eat that one when they get in here. They can have a little bit. They don't,
[03:06:49.840 --> 03:06:56.880]  they don't do too bad on that. Yeah. Killer, killer plant for ferments, um, high in calcium and,
[03:06:56.880 --> 03:07:05.040]  and, uh, potassium too. So we feed it right now through transition and we'll even give a little
[03:07:05.840 --> 03:07:06.320]  bit through flower.
[03:07:11.440 --> 03:07:18.880]  A kudzu, kudzu root enthusiast. Kudzu. Kudzu. Yeah, that shit is everywhere,
[03:07:19.840 --> 03:07:24.160]  but it wasn't anywhere when we were kids. Right. All of a sudden. Talk about invasive. Right.
[03:07:24.800 --> 03:07:30.880]  That shit wraps around telephone poles. Yeah, it does. Yeah. All right, guys. Uh, look forward to
[03:07:30.880 --> 03:07:36.160]  next week. Joey again, buddy. Really appreciate it. Everybody that's in Vegas. Hey, uh, we here
[03:07:36.160 --> 03:07:41.200]  all weekend. So if you want to hit us up, uh, please hit us up. Uh, we're about to head over
[03:07:41.200 --> 03:07:49.440]  to Mandalay Bay, um, and enjoy ourselves. Well, I like the sound of that. All right.
[03:07:49.440 --> 03:07:55.920]  It's called the mega room. Yeah, it is. Oh, I should shout him out. Actually. So shout out
[03:07:55.920 --> 03:08:00.000]  to Dan. The man that's hooked up this weekend for us, uh, hooking us up with, we get to go to this
[03:08:00.000 --> 03:08:05.840]  fancy show called the O at the Bellagio all thanks to him. So Dan, the man appreciate your brother.
[03:08:08.240 --> 03:08:12.080]  All right. Thanks everyone. Have a good one. All right, y'all take care of me.
