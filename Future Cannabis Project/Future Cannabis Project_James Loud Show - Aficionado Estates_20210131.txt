[00:01.790 --> 00:09.310]  And we are live. Good morning everyone. It's 11 a.m. on the West Coast on Sunday.
[00:09.310 --> 00:14.950]  Today we're gonna be talking to Leo Stone from Aficionado Estates and this
[00:14.950 --> 00:22.310]  is our host Mr. James Loud. Hey how's it going everyone? Welcome to week 16 of the
[00:22.310 --> 00:26.750]  James Loud show. I can't believe we made it to week 16. Thank you guys for tuning
[00:26.750 --> 00:31.750]  in. So Leo should be here in a little bit. Until he gets here we're gonna start
[00:31.750 --> 00:36.030]  discussing germination techniques. I feel like it's a great, it's a little
[00:36.030 --> 00:39.950]  early for your spring crops but it's and it's a good time to start talking about
[00:39.950 --> 00:44.190]  how to germinate seeds if you guys are unfamiliar with it. I'm gonna give you
[00:44.190 --> 00:50.590]  guys some ideas on how you can improve germination, how to do it simple. I think
[00:50.590 --> 00:54.350]  there's a lot of ways that can be done. There's so many different ways to you
[00:54.350 --> 00:56.750]  know they say there's so many different ways to skin a cat that definitely
[00:56.750 --> 01:00.870]  applies to germinating seeds. There's some wrong ways and there's some right
[01:00.950 --> 01:06.550]  ways. I would say that starting out I got some hemp right here that I'm germinating
[01:06.550 --> 01:13.870]  because I'm trying to get some CBD A which is you know we got this broken one
[01:13.870 --> 01:18.710]  right here that's not necessarily a good thing. But a lot of these you want to
[01:18.710 --> 01:25.750]  plant right when that taproot sticks out. These ones right here that's a little
[01:25.750 --> 01:30.630]  bit too far if you got auto flower. These are these are auto flower. You would you
[01:30.630 --> 01:33.630]  would not want it it'll stunt the growth by going like this and what
[01:33.630 --> 01:37.870]  happens is it'll get root bound and you can see these roots aren't super healthy.
[01:37.870 --> 01:41.270]  I did this just so I could show you guys normally I would have planted a week ago
[01:41.270 --> 01:46.790]  on those. Usually seven to ten days. Even this is borderline too much. I prefer
[01:46.790 --> 01:51.950]  them just to look like that right there when they go in their ground or their
[01:51.950 --> 01:56.670]  final home and these are rapid rooter cubes right here from General
[01:56.670 --> 02:04.310]  Hydroponics. They're real basic. I believe they're peat and so what I do
[02:04.310 --> 02:10.390]  to start off is I go ahead and take the seeds that I'm going to use whether it's
[02:10.390 --> 02:15.390]  ten seeds or a thousand seeds. A lot of times what I'll do is I'll sterilize the
[02:15.390 --> 02:21.110]  seeds by using a H2O2 hydrogen peroxide. Your basic stuff in the store which is a
[02:21.110 --> 02:28.270]  four percent solution and I take a one to six ratio with water so percent one
[02:28.270 --> 02:34.790]  one part hydrogen peroxide to six parts water and I do a soak for 24 hours. You
[02:34.790 --> 02:40.390]  can do it as short as 12, 24 hours is good and then you transfer to paper
[02:40.390 --> 02:44.910]  towel and this is just if you're doing small amounts. If you're doing larger
[02:44.910 --> 02:47.550]  amounts you know there's all kinds of different ways to do it but I mean if
[02:47.550 --> 02:50.070]  you're doing less than a thousand I think it's a real simple way to do it.
[02:50.070 --> 02:57.470]  Transfer to a paper towel, wait till you see a taproot and then and then plant it
[02:57.470 --> 03:02.990]  in. So as soon as that the radical which is the little white taproot sticks out
[03:02.990 --> 03:05.250]  you're gonna want to take that and you're gonna want to plant it and I
[03:05.250 --> 03:09.950]  think one big mistake is people think that the pointy end goes down and that
[03:09.950 --> 03:13.790]  is just not true. The pointy end goes up. You can actually just put them in there
[03:13.790 --> 03:17.990]  right after the soak and go pointy end up. What happens is if you go pointy end
[03:17.990 --> 03:24.230]  down the actual radical spins around and it'll try to shoot up. In soil it's
[03:24.230 --> 03:29.830]  not a big deal. You know it's cocoa or different mediums. It's not a big deal. My
[03:29.830 --> 03:33.390]  suggestion is usually go with the substrate you're gonna end up in. So if
[03:33.390 --> 03:36.550]  you're cocoa you can use straight cocoa in there. The problem with cocoa is you
[03:36.550 --> 03:42.470]  want to make sure you have a nutrient solution. Cocoa is inert and cocoa by
[03:42.470 --> 03:45.270]  itself with water you can you can germinate the seeds in there but I would
[03:45.270 --> 03:49.590]  say going with a basic nutrient solution 300 parts per million making
[03:49.590 --> 03:54.670]  sure that you're getting some nitrogen in there. But yeah so what happens is
[03:54.670 --> 03:59.190]  that taproot will spin around and if you go pointy end down you can have the
[03:59.190 --> 04:04.550]  taproot shoot up. And so in stuff that's a little more dense like these peat
[04:04.550 --> 04:10.790]  plugs what happens is you'll get the taproot sticking out the opposite end. So
[04:10.790 --> 04:14.670]  that that's pretty basic. If you're going in dirt you can go soil you know if
[04:14.710 --> 04:17.670]  we're talking about commercial application using a needle seeder which
[04:17.670 --> 04:21.510]  is like a vacuum seeder that has fingers that have vacuums on them they go in a
[04:21.510 --> 04:26.150]  in a container and pull your seeds out then as your trays are moving on a belt
[04:26.150 --> 04:31.590]  they inject the seed right into the soil. And if you have moist soil you just
[04:31.590 --> 04:36.110]  cover a plastic wrap. Those are all real easy ways to do it but I like to soak
[04:36.110 --> 04:41.430]  soak with the hydrogen peroxide. So I guess if we have any questions you guys
[04:41.430 --> 04:48.670]  got any questions about germinating seeds. Little veg bloom yes indeed. Yeah
[04:48.670 --> 04:54.790]  that's a good idea. Well so hold on let me scroll up.
[04:54.790 --> 04:59.590]  Huncho had a comment he said you're literally cutting your yield in half not
[04:59.590 --> 05:04.950]  planting the autos in their final pots from seed. So I would disagree with that.
[05:04.950 --> 05:09.670]  I think starting and getting an even germination is important. You can
[05:09.670 --> 05:14.390]  definitely start in I think field sown is amazing. If you go start them from the
[05:14.390 --> 05:18.630]  pots they're going that's amazing but using a one week germination in
[05:18.630 --> 05:26.750]  substrate like this peat or even in soil has its advantages. Just soak 24 hours in
[05:26.750 --> 05:30.150]  the plant you know. I mean there's so many different ways this is the way I do
[05:30.150 --> 05:34.990]  it this is the way I do it and I get 99 to 100 percent germination. So I guess
[05:34.990 --> 05:38.430]  you should try it different ways and see what you get and the higher germination
[05:38.430 --> 05:42.670]  rate is obviously better. But I feel like I get a more even germination if I
[05:42.670 --> 05:49.070]  go 24 hours under fluorescence for about a week and then transplant. So like I
[05:49.070 --> 05:51.990]  said there's so many ways to skin a cat there's no wrong way to do it. Some
[05:51.990 --> 05:55.390]  people don't even use the hydrogen peroxide soak and get really good results
[05:55.390 --> 05:59.510]  going straight in to the soaked cubes. And what I do what I soak them in is a
[05:59.510 --> 06:05.190]  light nutrient solution 300 parts per million and I soak these probably for
[06:05.190 --> 06:09.870]  six hours in there. Make sure to push it down really good. If you're just doing a
[06:09.870 --> 06:13.630]  small amount five gallon bucket will work. If you're doing like larger amounts
[06:13.630 --> 06:20.310]  tubs you put them in the plastic tubs. Yeah. One of the questions we got a
[06:20.310 --> 06:26.590]  while ago was or before the show by email was about really old seeds. Any
[06:26.590 --> 06:32.310]  advice? Yeah so for old seeds there's a lot of different ways you know I think
[06:32.310 --> 06:35.550]  scarification which is a process of putting like if you're just I would
[06:35.550 --> 06:38.990]  start with a small amount obviously if you're having issues but you can put
[06:38.990 --> 06:43.350]  them in a little if you can still find matchboxes you put the the striker
[06:43.350 --> 06:48.910]  that's on there on the inside and what you do is you can shake it in there and
[06:48.910 --> 06:53.910]  and basically scar the edges of the seed and that'll help with allowing the
[06:53.910 --> 06:57.590]  moisture in to help germinate. You can also just take some sandpaper on the
[06:57.590 --> 07:02.710]  edges and actually go around on the edge and hit the sandpaper and that'll
[07:02.710 --> 07:06.790]  help open it up. Jubilic acid is another great one. I can't remember how many
[07:06.790 --> 07:12.070]  parts per million just right off the top of my head but GA3 definitely helps and
[07:12.070 --> 07:16.510]  I've seen guys do germination you know in a lab they'll use test tube and
[07:16.510 --> 07:19.590]  they'll put a little cocoa in there and do it you know real simple. I think
[07:19.590 --> 07:26.030]  that's an effective way for old seeds. Embryonic rescue on really old seeds. I
[07:26.030 --> 07:31.830]  have never had it but Justin from DSG labs is one of the guys if you have
[07:31.830 --> 07:39.470]  really old seeds I'm sure he can help you out. There's a Mr. Toad comment. Mr.
[07:39.470 --> 07:50.390]  Toad the seeds. Nice. I think he has a couple extra bees in there. Yeah. Enzyme
[07:50.390 --> 07:55.310]  breaking down starches and amino acids. Okay someone said this is this is great
[07:55.310 --> 07:58.750]  though someone said put mouth in 30 seconds before planting one week before
[07:58.750 --> 08:04.790]  a full or so I think. So this is something that DJ short said years ago
[08:04.790 --> 08:09.350]  and I don't want to take anything away from DJ short or anybody else that you
[08:09.350 --> 08:12.550]  know the connection with the plant however you connect with the plant
[08:12.550 --> 08:17.830]  that's a good thing. I mean I think there is some benefits I think the best growers
[08:17.830 --> 08:22.110]  I know are well connected to the plant you know they're in there. Putting it in
[08:22.110 --> 08:32.630]  your mouth I think you're exposed to the contamination. I think I don't recommend it. I
[08:32.630 --> 08:36.070]  think I learned a lot from DJ short too. He said the most valuable thing he taught
[08:36.070 --> 08:40.070]  me was I was talking about tissue culture in maybe 2012 I think we were at
[08:40.070 --> 08:45.030]  Emerald Cup and maybe it was 2013 but we were Emerald Cup and talking about
[08:45.030 --> 08:47.990]  tissue culture and I was so excited to get into tissue culture something I
[08:47.990 --> 08:51.390]  really wanted to do and he was saying don't worry about tissue culture put
[08:51.390 --> 08:56.550]  that plant in the ground take that old clone put it in the ground and come you
[08:56.550 --> 08:59.950]  know the end towards the end of spring you're gonna have something that's
[08:59.950 --> 09:03.110]  that's revitalized you're gonna get that vigor that you're looking for all these
[09:03.110 --> 09:07.550]  things back. I did it I was totally blown away you know it was actually sour diesel
[09:07.550 --> 09:11.390]  that I did it with and I got really really good results and there's
[09:11.390 --> 09:15.390]  definitely truth to that I mean you get the rapid growth and just taking clone
[09:15.390 --> 09:19.750]  off a clone and keeping them indoors you can do that you can get plant health but
[09:19.750 --> 09:22.750]  I feel like you get optimal plant health there's something about the connection
[09:22.750 --> 09:32.470]  with the earth than with this. Leo is coming on hopefully let's see it's fat
[09:32.470 --> 09:40.590]  fashionably late. We're gonna give him a call. Hey what's up dude?
[09:40.590 --> 10:01.430]  He's trying to connect still. Yeah it's on StreamYard. Well let me know we're
[10:01.430 --> 10:07.710]  just going over some basic stuff so we got we got time we got a lot of anxious
[10:07.710 --> 10:13.270]  people apparently. They don't want to listen to us they want to hear him. They're all
[10:13.270 --> 10:24.460]  excited for Leo so. Yeah yesterday people had issues connecting because of the
[10:24.460 --> 10:41.310]  storm. Leo will be on just a second guys. Mr. Mango nice tech lol I'm sold
[10:41.310 --> 10:48.230]  shit tech. Man Mango Tech so you know I think there's a lot of interesting stuff
[10:48.230 --> 10:51.590]  Mango Tech I like Trollmaster I don't know if you guys are familiar with
[10:51.590 --> 10:55.470]  Trollmaster you know we can get into debates but Trollmaster is probably I
[10:55.470 --> 10:59.590]  just started using Trollmaster recently and I just switched over to LEDs
[10:59.590 --> 11:04.390]  recently believe it or not like everybody else seems to it's just I'm
[11:04.390 --> 11:09.310]  not doing everything with LEDs in fact I'm not doing reversals with LEDs
[11:09.310 --> 11:13.270]  because one of my friends did a side-by-side and found with reversals
[11:13.270 --> 11:18.230]  that he was getting much better results with HPS and I think that probably has
[11:18.230 --> 11:23.550]  to do with the red spectrum I mean that would be that it's you know it's either
[11:23.550 --> 11:29.510]  UV or red and I would I would you know I know UV is a problem outdoors getting
[11:29.510 --> 11:32.910]  reversals done outdoors like in the field field reversals you have a lot of
[11:32.910 --> 11:36.630]  problems I think that's contributed the UV light so remember if you guys are
[11:36.630 --> 11:41.950]  using STS nano silver colloidal silver to do your reversals HPS over LEDs if
[11:41.950 --> 11:48.670]  you're switching over to LEDs like I am question after transplanting seeds into
[11:48.670 --> 11:53.070]  a solo cup or small pot should the cup stay in the cloner box under a light I'm
[11:53.070 --> 11:58.230]  growing outdoors in a small greenhouse yes yeah I mean I would put them under a
[11:58.230 --> 12:01.190]  light if you can bring them out door it's depending on what you're trying to
[12:01.190 --> 12:04.150]  do too if you're trying to build up stock for your mother's now is a great
[12:04.150 --> 12:07.830]  time to start your plants if you plan on taking clones off of your seed starts
[12:07.830 --> 12:11.750]  if you're going direct from seed which gives you that taproot which gives you a
[12:11.750 --> 12:15.070]  bigger plant and you're growing outdoors you're gonna want to wait a little bit
[12:15.070 --> 12:18.750]  but you know you can you can put them under light you can get them a little
[12:18.750 --> 12:23.230]  bit bigger the the worry is acclimating your seeds properly hardening them off
[12:23.230 --> 12:27.350]  hardening your plants off and just putting them outdoors and then having
[12:27.350 --> 12:32.550]  them die or having them suffer and sometimes they'll go into flower right
[12:32.550 --> 12:36.190]  away if they're on 24 hours and you put them up outdoors they're gonna go right
[12:36.190 --> 12:41.390]  into flower so we got someone says I use sandpaper on a till of seeds and soak in
[12:41.390 --> 12:46.190]  peroxide water and then they pop in 24 hours and right into the final pots for
[12:46.190 --> 12:51.030]  autos three gallon fabric pots yeah three gallons were good I use one gallon
[12:51.030 --> 12:56.110]  to two gallon typically depending I mean I like a good dry back with my autos so
[12:56.110 --> 13:02.470]  I definitely feed like three times a day for five minutes indoors with a with a
[13:02.470 --> 13:07.710]  one gallon pot they really drink they get big and I put a you know I put a 16
[13:07.710 --> 13:13.550]  plants under a 4x4 so with autos and you know there's so many different ways to
[13:13.550 --> 13:18.670]  do it I feel like that's the most optimal for what I've seen so someone
[13:18.670 --> 13:26.110]  says sunlight has both radiant energy and light energy LEDs and HPS yeah Alan
[13:26.110 --> 13:36.080]  Hazen so for you typically are you going I mean you have your rapid routers and
[13:36.240 --> 13:44.400]  then are you going into if you're doing it at go ahead hey Leo how you doing
[13:47.360 --> 13:53.520]  are you connecting with a MacBook okay so you're gonna want to download Chrome
[13:53.520 --> 13:59.840]  if you don't have Chrome okay well then you should just be able to click in and
[13:59.840 --> 14:07.920]  you should come right on and just pick his camera source and it was the link
[14:07.920 --> 14:19.160]  that I sent you yes we sent it to the info at a fish in Ottawa States okay
[14:19.160 --> 14:30.160]  perfect the struggle is real guys we're live
[14:30.160 --> 14:40.040]  we're getting this signed in and Gucci and then we'll be good to go and then
[14:40.040 --> 14:47.880]  I'll be able to open this camera up boom boom doing good all right here we go
[14:47.880 --> 14:53.360]  yep someone put the words Mephisto now Mephisto has a lot of meaning for
[14:53.360 --> 14:57.720]  everybody in the auto community whether you know it or not I feel like Mephisto
[14:57.720 --> 15:02.640]  was the one that really you know I went to my buddy Nick's years ago and saw his
[15:02.640 --> 15:05.840]  auto flower like about three years ago I've been working with autos for about
[15:05.840 --> 15:11.480]  three years and Mephisto I believe changed the game because I was in Spain
[15:11.480 --> 15:16.280]  in Amsterdam in to the early 2000s and in 2010 and saw autos there and totally
[15:16.280 --> 15:20.960]  disappointed said I would never ever ever ever work with autos that they were
[15:20.960 --> 15:27.440]  garbage they had a little bit of chirps they had almost no to you like not as
[15:27.440 --> 15:32.680]  good as a lot of the hemp and you know what I saw Mephisto genetics for the
[15:32.680 --> 15:35.040]  first time I wasn't even told they were autos he said what do you think of these
[15:35.040 --> 15:38.720]  I said oh man these look great and it was I believe it was around March and it
[15:38.720 --> 15:43.360]  was a greenhouse in Santa Rosa and crushing and he said no these are autos
[15:43.360 --> 15:48.680]  and I was like holy shit these are auto flowers and completely changed my mind
[15:48.680 --> 15:55.370]  you know we're getting stuff to test in the 20s now we got Leo how you doing Leo
[15:55.410 --> 16:01.250]  good good good good to see you guys good to see you Leah someone was busting your
[16:01.250 --> 16:12.090]  balls can you read that comment oh yeah okay yeah I live in the mountains bro
[16:12.090 --> 16:17.050]  there's like no there's like we have no choice like when I did the interview
[16:17.050 --> 16:22.650]  with Dylan from who bred the rainbird I had to sit in the car right in front of
[16:22.650 --> 16:26.730]  the greenhouse where we only get service on the property because you know
[16:26.730 --> 16:30.610]  we had this mountain over here called Pratt Mountain and it's where all of our
[16:30.610 --> 16:35.370]  our cell phone feeds our internet feeds come from so if that thing's blocked out
[16:35.370 --> 16:39.850]  we're shit out of luck so right now the storms bad I'm really surprised I could
[16:39.850 --> 16:46.010]  stream with you guys right now so this is cool awesome so yeah man thanks for
[16:46.010 --> 16:49.090]  coming on the show yeah really appreciate it so I wanted to start off
[16:49.090 --> 16:52.210]  by telling everybody a little brother yeah I want to start off by telling
[16:52.210 --> 16:58.170]  everyone a little story about your seeds and aficionado genetics my real
[16:58.170 --> 17:02.290]  experience I mean I saw the prices the secondary market $2,000 a pack and
[17:02.290 --> 17:07.850]  somebody had given me a pack of the vanilla berry pie Caesar THC is or gave
[17:07.850 --> 17:11.610]  me a pack of them and I was like looked up the price I'm like who the fuck pays
[17:11.610 --> 17:16.410]  $2,000 for a fucking pack of seeds yeah there's no way this 10 or 12 pack can be
[17:16.410 --> 17:20.090]  worth $2,000 you got to be fucking kidding me man I don't understand this
[17:20.090 --> 17:25.210]  type thing and I had popped 800 seeds that year and there was this patch that
[17:25.210 --> 17:29.210]  you could see from 40 feet away and it was those vanilla berry pies I have to
[17:29.210 --> 17:32.930]  eat my words on those and I still tell that story to this day that out of 800
[17:32.930 --> 17:36.770]  that pack was by far the best of the stuff that we had popped out there so
[17:36.770 --> 17:44.250]  big respect for that and you know that amazing amazing stuff so yeah so you
[17:44.250 --> 17:48.770]  want to start off by telling us about about about you how you got started in
[17:48.770 --> 17:56.170]  the industry your history with cannabis I got I think I think it's universal I
[17:56.170 --> 18:00.890]  got lucky you know honestly I mean there was you know when I made the decision to
[18:00.890 --> 18:05.570]  do it full-time I mean I got basically for back of better terms thrown out of
[18:05.570 --> 18:09.210]  the military because of weed you know what I mean like I can't reenter because
[18:09.210 --> 18:13.370]  it was for what they call the drug rehabilitation failure I just kept
[18:13.370 --> 18:17.330]  popping hot for weed you know what I mean but it felt natural to me it's the
[18:17.330 --> 18:21.650]  only thing that allowed me to stop drinking every day that allowed me to
[18:21.650 --> 18:25.050]  not you know deal with my fucking problems with a bottle of vodka every
[18:25.050 --> 18:29.690]  day so when we were in Europe you know that's when you know the weed really
[18:29.690 --> 18:33.090]  changed my life and that's when I decided like I'm gonna go I'm gonna go
[18:33.090 --> 18:38.210]  all out I'm gonna go full full bore ahead on this thing because I had no
[18:38.210 --> 18:43.330]  choice and it was what I fell in love with and I kind of got into it and you
[18:43.330 --> 18:47.330]  know a little bit of a darker market because a lot of the people I was
[18:47.330 --> 18:50.650]  dealing with and I was really good friends with were French or German and
[18:50.650 --> 18:56.410]  they were all selling lots of hash and so my first foray into cannabis was like
[18:56.410 --> 19:01.450]  the hash the hash underground in Germany and on the border of Germany and France
[19:01.450 --> 19:05.490]  Strasbourg so like you know that's why Frenchy and I hella connected right and
[19:05.490 --> 19:09.370]  so and then you know the fast-forward all these years later like there's
[19:09.370 --> 19:13.090]  people I worked with in Strasbourg that know my French partners right now so it's
[19:13.090 --> 19:17.130]  like it's such a small world so that's what really got me lucky was going to
[19:17.130 --> 19:21.570]  Amsterdam going to check and having friends that grew in Germany that really
[19:21.570 --> 19:26.210]  put me on to the weed hardcore at a time in my life when I really needed it so I
[19:26.210 --> 19:29.810]  thought it was cool that one I could smoke this and I could get super high
[19:29.810 --> 19:33.130]  and we can make hash off of it but I thought it was really cool when you
[19:33.130 --> 19:36.090]  first started getting to like oh fuck I could buy these seeds and I could hide
[19:36.090 --> 19:39.370]  these seeds and I could save seeds and then you start meeting the other
[19:39.490 --> 19:43.170]  stoners in the fucking military like stoners could see each other you could
[19:43.170 --> 19:47.250]  be out in public like I know that dude he smoked you could just pick him out
[19:47.250 --> 19:51.570]  from you know so the stoners started finding each other in the army and you
[19:51.570 --> 19:54.810]  start finding people's like well you didn't bring seeds back from Afghanistan
[19:54.810 --> 19:57.690]  so you start finding people's like bro I got these seeds I brought these seeds
[19:57.690 --> 20:01.490]  back I mean we were doing operations with Turkish military so I had friends
[20:01.490 --> 20:05.730]  bringing seeds back from Turkey I mean there's a friend I have I've been trying
[20:05.730 --> 20:09.650]  to get in contact with that has some seeds that he's swear he got from Tikrit
[20:09.650 --> 20:13.610]  which is in the north of Iraq where a lot of the Kurdish forces hang out and
[20:13.610 --> 20:18.530]  apparently that's the correct train was brought from the Kurds and was traded
[20:18.530 --> 20:23.330]  amongst the Kurds and the Turks because of their proximity to Turkey so you know
[20:23.330 --> 20:26.650]  we got some Turkish trains but I'm still waiting to get some of those old Kurdish
[20:26.650 --> 20:31.210]  trains it was really that background that got me into it and got me into
[20:31.330 --> 20:36.050]  collecting seeds and getting clones so when I got out of the army I landed back
[20:36.050 --> 20:42.290]  where my family's at in San Diego and my brother worked for this old-school dude
[20:42.290 --> 20:47.530]  named OG Mountain Mike shout out Mendo Mike who's from Laytonville and he was
[20:47.530 --> 20:52.370]  the one that opened up this dispensary down in San Diego with Eddie Lep before
[20:52.370 --> 20:58.330]  Eddie Lep got locked up for 10 years for doing the healing fields and I was fresh
[20:58.450 --> 21:02.730]  out of the army and I had you know I was growing in my brother's closet bro I was
[21:02.730 --> 21:06.330]  like I'm going to Cali I'm gonna grow some weed it's it's what I believe in
[21:06.330 --> 21:10.690]  it's what I want to do and at the time I was working for Mike at the dispensary
[21:10.690 --> 21:16.410]  and like you know oh nine and you know he's an old deadhead who hitchhiked out
[21:16.410 --> 21:21.610]  to California in 78 and just went and went ham so he saw the genetics I was
[21:21.610 --> 21:24.650]  collecting and some of the seeds that I had brought back from my service in the
[21:24.650 --> 21:28.770]  army he was like all right bet he's like are you good with you know are you
[21:28.770 --> 21:32.730]  you're obviously trained so do you want to be do you want to be my head of
[21:32.730 --> 21:35.050]  security and I was like hell yeah I'll be your fuck I'm doing anything for you
[21:35.050 --> 21:40.290]  at this point I was gonna do anything to get into the game because it's it's what
[21:40.290 --> 21:43.690]  I wanted to do and it's kind of like it's what saved me from drinking myself
[21:43.690 --> 21:47.610]  under a table like a lot of like what happens to a lot of vets that don't know
[21:47.610 --> 21:52.450]  how to deal with with what the what the fuck they saw in the desert or wherever
[21:52.450 --> 21:57.250]  or in the mountains or wherever they were deployed so I owe my whole career
[21:57.250 --> 22:03.490]  and my being here to to my brother and OG Mike that that got me you know in
[22:03.490 --> 22:07.490]  the cannabis formula you know I didn't know this whole world was here my first
[22:07.490 --> 22:11.970]  my first introduction to cannabis was in France and Germany with a bunch of
[22:11.970 --> 22:16.290]  fucking you know unsavory characters because when you're moving hash on you
[22:16.290 --> 22:19.690]  you know you know Europe it's trippy they've been being they've been gangster
[22:19.690 --> 22:23.450]  longer than than America's been a country I was it was shocking you know
[22:23.450 --> 22:27.530]  what I mean and so to see that there was a there was this whole beautiful
[22:27.530 --> 22:31.210]  ecosystem of cannabis growers and above-ground people that had seed
[22:31.210 --> 22:34.610]  companies like that was crazy I thought it was just an Amsterdam thing you know
[22:34.610 --> 22:38.450]  an Amsterdam thing where it was all branding wise but when I came to Cali it
[22:38.450 --> 22:42.610]  was it was a culture shock one I grew up in Japan and two I started my weed
[22:42.610 --> 22:45.970]  foray in Germany because the first only thing we could get in Japan was hash
[22:45.970 --> 22:50.690]  like a weed so illegal in Japan when I was growing up I lived there till I was
[22:50.690 --> 22:55.290]  20 and weed was 7,000 yen a gram in Tokyo growing up and that's 70 bucks
[22:55.290 --> 23:01.090]  right when the exchange rate was okay 70 bucks a gram and it's still it still
[23:01.090 --> 23:05.250]  holds at 50 60 a gram nowadays because it's so rare and the punishment is so
[23:05.250 --> 23:09.530]  severe to get caught with it so you know hash was definitely my background I got
[23:09.530 --> 23:13.210]  lucky in the collecting seeds with people that were in the service I thought
[23:13.210 --> 23:25.520]  that was cool but Mike Mike showed me up lost him for a second
[23:25.520 --> 23:36.080]  that a rainstorm I don't do it every time well while we're up here he goes
[23:36.080 --> 23:47.800]  lost your second carry on we there yep I think I lost you guys we're back
[23:48.360 --> 23:53.880]  my screen is all blank sorry for the technical difficulties I'm in the
[23:53.880 --> 24:08.760]  mountains what's happening right now yeah you can you hear us well I'm super

[24:50.100 --> 24:56.820]  update on the cactus so since last week's episode I was done in San Diego I
[24:56.820 --> 25:01.660]  wouldn't checked out a old-school chronic we hung out it was real brief it
[25:01.660 --> 25:06.660]  was like 730 in the morning I got to see some of his interesting plants that were
[25:06.660 --> 25:11.620]  cat piss varieties that were three weeks to four weeks in and so it's real hard
[25:11.620 --> 25:14.420]  to tell chirping profile but I'll definitely be going back there to check
[25:14.420 --> 25:27.960]  it out so Peter I'm getting a little bit of a feedback echo haha oh wait way
[25:27.960 --> 25:34.000]  way way better so yeah so cactus and then I've been talking to 707 seed bank
[25:34.000 --> 25:39.000]  he sent me some of his seeds he didn't grow cactus this year but uh we will be
[25:39.000 --> 25:42.840]  holding a cup it's gonna be an invitation only Adam Dunn and I are
[25:42.840 --> 25:47.280]  gonna be putting it together sometime in June probably around the 15th so it's

[26:00.960 --> 26:04.880]  school chronic I think I can see people this is horrible
[26:04.880 --> 26:10.040]  so you're alive assessment in the show but I don't see nobody this is the word
[26:10.680 --> 26:14.840]  it's my internet it's cuz I've been humble sorry everybody but I still
[26:14.840 --> 26:20.760]  cannot see James I think that was my best though that was up there

[26:33.160 --> 26:37.640]  guys this is trippy alright guys this is why a lot of people live in humble
[26:37.640 --> 26:43.280]  because you don't get good internet could take connectivity oh man yeah I'm
[26:43.280 --> 26:49.480]  gonna have to log off and in text James this is sorry about my internet when I
[26:49.480 --> 26:56.880]  James do you want to text him up there he goes I so I even my text haven't even
[26:56.880 --> 27:01.720]  gone through yet I can see them going to him but they haven't been delivered so
[27:01.720 --> 27:07.400]  you know living in humble it's a blessing and a curse everywhere you know
[27:07.400 --> 27:13.080]  there's benefits to living in places I live in the East Bay I love it here I'm
[27:13.080 --> 27:18.880]  able to go down to San Diego and hang out down there and check out cat piss I
[27:18.880 --> 27:24.440]  think there's gonna be some really interesting things coming out now that
[27:24.440 --> 27:28.700]  we're talking about it I feel like a lot of people looking for those ammonia type
[27:28.700 --> 27:35.120]  noses on stuff I think you'll find it in a lot of the Hayes varieties Tom's his
[27:35.120 --> 27:41.920]  snow bud times g13 I've had people come back so their g13 or their snow bud has
[27:41.920 --> 27:46.560]  some ammonia in it I would really love to see those varieties if you're in
[27:46.560 --> 27:51.000]  California you want to talk about email me at James loud genetics at gmail.com
[27:51.000 --> 27:57.120]  if you want to talk more about cat piss if you got any stories history if you're
[27:57.120 --> 28:01.000]  from the Bay Area and you know the cat piss also the guys with the Ebola
[28:01.000 --> 28:04.480]  they're gonna be coming on they got it through tissue culture right now their
[28:04.640 --> 28:09.840]  piss through node I've been talking to them and I still have yet to see the
[28:09.840 --> 28:13.840]  flower but I feel like we're moving forward with it so it's a good place to
[28:13.840 --> 28:26.970]  be so I know there are some amazing seed collections in chat yeah show and tell
[28:26.970 --> 28:30.930]  yeah people in chat you want to talk about your seed collections I think it's
[28:30.930 --> 28:33.210]  really interesting I mean I think that there's definitely the side of
[28:33.330 --> 28:37.210]  preservation that's important with collecting seeds but there's this huge
[28:37.210 --> 28:42.050]  market of people that buy seeds and don't germinate them and I understand
[28:42.050 --> 28:46.730]  preserving genetics is one thing but I also you know when people buy my seeds I
[28:46.730 --> 28:51.010]  would love if they pop them collecting great man but I would love you to buy
[28:51.010 --> 28:56.690]  seeds germinate them breed with them you know enjoy the plants that's what I
[28:56.690 --> 29:02.770]  breed them for you know I think there's a lot of guys out there breeding good
[29:02.770 --> 29:08.090]  stuff and there's a lot of guys out there breeding bad stuff you know I've
[29:08.090 --> 29:13.450]  just we've been talking about Oh Scrum Indiana bubblegum yeah the Indiana
[29:13.450 --> 29:16.610]  bubblegum seeds are out there for sure there's a lot of good ones still in cuts
[29:16.610 --> 29:21.410]  is there any northern lights in Pelly champagne well you know what you guys
[29:21.410 --> 29:26.250]  are talking about Pelly he's gonna be on the show next week we got a Pelly coming
[29:26.250 --> 29:31.450]  on to discuss the origins of champagne it's a legendary Bay Area strain well
[29:31.450 --> 29:37.530]  known throughout the rap and hip-hop community and you know good stuff Bay
[29:37.530 --> 29:44.490]  Area weed really interesting Pelly can talk about it next week so I'm not gonna
[29:44.490 --> 29:49.970]  give any ideas on what I think it is black lime bag seed someone has really
[29:49.970 --> 29:55.890]  limey and skunky black lime reserves one of Leo's killer varieties it's well
[29:55.890 --> 30:03.840]  known that's been bred into some good stuff don't sleep on a fish in our
[30:03.840 --> 30:08.120]  United States the best seeds on the market much respect to the legend much
[30:08.120 --> 30:13.160]  appreciation for this live yeah Leo definitely has some good seeds I know
[30:13.160 --> 30:16.680]  that my experience with that vanilla berry pie I really had to eat my words
[30:16.680 --> 30:20.840]  which has happened several times in my life I try to be humble about stuff and
[30:20.840 --> 30:24.920]  stuff throws me off though that people would have to pay that much for a seat a
[30:24.920 --> 30:31.440]  pack of seeds $2,000 for a pack of seeds sounds crazy to me you know I would love
[30:31.440 --> 30:36.040]  to give all my seeds away for you know a reasonable price and that's why I have
[30:36.040 --> 30:40.840]  different tiers of pricing typically with my stuff and I also do bulk seeds
[30:40.840 --> 30:54.870]  so what are fast flowering strains cross to autos but still photo period so in
[30:54.870 --> 30:57.830]  that first generation when you take an auto in a photo period this is a great
[30:57.830 --> 31:02.790]  topic but semi autos are that first generation where you have an a stable
[31:02.790 --> 31:05.950]  auto flower you can use any auto flower technically and put it with the photo
[31:06.070 --> 31:12.270]  period you get a semi auto that finishes faster and triggers quicker so there's
[31:12.270 --> 31:15.550]  benefits if you guys are buying autos you reverse the autos or use a regular
[31:15.550 --> 31:18.990]  auto and you put that with your favorite photo period you should get varieties
[31:18.990 --> 31:23.990]  that that trigger faster and finish faster you can do selections and you can
[31:23.990 --> 31:28.910]  keep those alive the trick with those to keep them alive is 24 hours of light
[31:28.910 --> 31:33.790]  Odie's Oregon diesel from homegrown natural wonders that's another great
[31:33.910 --> 31:38.110]  if you guys ever a chance to work with it that's a semi auto that unless it's
[31:38.110 --> 31:42.750]  given you know like 22 to 24 hours of light it'll trigger into flower so there
[31:42.750 --> 31:47.790]  are disadvantages to that like light consumption you know the amount of
[31:47.790 --> 31:51.910]  energy you use but I think there's gonna be a big market for people creating
[31:51.910 --> 31:56.590]  really stabilized version someone says how can I buy your beans my beans are
[31:56.590 --> 32:03.430]  available on daggett love that's the Peters future cannabis projects website
[32:03.430 --> 32:08.070]  www.daggett love I got my varieties we got some new stuff coming down for
[32:08.070 --> 32:12.510]  Valentine's Day that I'll be discussing with both the brands that I'm working
[32:12.510 --> 32:17.350]  with with ganja farmer seed company with my partner Marlon Asher and with loud
[32:17.350 --> 32:22.150]  canna genics in fact those guys are gonna probably pop on next week or the
[32:22.150 --> 32:27.750]  week after to discuss our new varieties we got the offendo with a GMO other
[32:27.750 --> 32:35.750]  times July 40 Leo says my internet is lagging too hard I think so we may have
[32:35.750 --> 32:39.030]  him come on we'll get him down out of the mountains maybe sometime during the
[32:39.030 --> 32:44.990]  week and do a show but let's see we can do some Q&A for you guys if you want to
[32:44.990 --> 32:49.950]  stay popping and breeding for our heads I think everyone should grow their own
[32:49.950 --> 32:53.430]  you know that's that's my opinion I would love it if everybody had their six
[32:53.430 --> 33:01.310]  plants in California or 12 plants so yeah it looks like Leo's having trouble
[33:01.310 --> 33:06.990]  getting on we can do it later in the week I'm gonna text him we can fill in
[33:06.990 --> 33:17.880]  later in the week can go up against the Super Bowl yeah we're not doing it on
[33:17.880 --> 33:22.160]  Super Bowl but we could do it on you know we could do it before or after we
[33:22.160 --> 33:27.840]  could do it you know the site or can be the Super Bowl pregame someone's growing a
[33:27.840 --> 33:34.640]  cat piss that this pregame yeah we could we could gamble on the show live
[33:34.640 --> 33:38.880]  growing a cat piss from that super silver hayes FINA yeah I think I
[33:38.880 --> 33:43.880]  honestly I you know after talking to everybody my opinion on the cat piss has
[33:43.880 --> 33:47.800]  changed quite a bit I think that we're not looking for one cat piss it's a
[33:47.800 --> 33:53.560]  description so the difficulty with the cat piss is that it describes a smell it
[33:53.560 --> 33:57.280]  describes a profile something that you can relate to and I think there's a lot
[33:57.280 --> 34:02.440]  of things that have that ammonia kind of pissy nose Bernie smell stuff coming
[34:02.440 --> 34:06.640]  from the haze but also stuff that's popping up and it's not just one thing
[34:06.640 --> 34:11.320]  and unfortunately oh gee kush is a name that we associate with a specific
[34:11.320 --> 34:16.480]  profile but you can't say oh gee kush without thinking gas without thinking
[34:16.480 --> 34:20.320]  especially gas but also pine lemon those are things we associate with that
[34:20.320 --> 34:23.960]  cat piss is very distinct when someone says cat piss you think of what this cat
[34:23.960 --> 34:27.760]  piss smell like and so I believe that there's multiple varieties I've been
[34:27.760 --> 34:34.960]  talking to Tom quite a bit 707 seeds and I feel like Tom's you know it's and I've
[34:34.960 --> 34:38.480]  done some research I've talked to friends Tom definitely has that San
[34:38.480 --> 34:43.300]  Diego cat piss that's where it came from without a doubt like the guy dislike the
[34:43.300 --> 34:47.900]  guy whatever he deserves the credit for San Diego cat piss and you know as far
[34:47.900 --> 34:50.780]  as I'm concerned it could he can have the designation for the original cat
[34:50.780 --> 34:53.740]  piss too that's okay I'm not worried about that but what we need to do is
[34:53.740 --> 34:57.380]  really define these other varieties of cat piss that are well known because
[34:57.380 --> 35:00.840]  they're not going away anytime soon so that's kind of what the cat piss cup is
[35:00.840 --> 35:05.740]  gonna be about is gonna be cat piss only varieties we're gonna have a contest
[35:05.740 --> 35:10.900]  cat pissing contest and it's gonna be friendly invite only if you have the
[35:10.900 --> 35:14.260]  flower that you think is worthy of being entered into the cup you know I
[35:14.260 --> 35:19.020]  have a feeling some people are gonna have hurt feelings but uh I this is a
[35:19.020 --> 35:23.180]  debate that needs to happen I think we're gonna film it with Peter with the
[35:23.180 --> 35:26.500]  future cannabis project and Adam Dunn with the Adam Dunn show who's one of my
[35:26.500 --> 35:32.540]  good friends using his invitational experience and we're gonna get a house
[35:32.540 --> 35:39.260]  and put everybody together film it so yeah and cat piss I mean I'm super
[35:39.260 --> 35:42.700]  excited about it people talk about it in high school way back in the day you
[35:42.700 --> 35:46.660]  know the stuff we had was loose bells and buds that smelled like ammonia and
[35:46.660 --> 35:52.780]  chlorine tablets yeah and skunky we had the mr. toad that's exactly what I'm
[35:52.780 --> 35:56.980]  talking about was that ammonia but really overpowering skunk smell and I
[35:56.980 --> 36:02.580]  mean this stuff was so potent that your whole house would smell like cat piss
[36:02.580 --> 36:06.180]  even if you had a gram if you had a tenth of a gram people around you would
[36:06.180 --> 36:09.860]  know you're smoking it could smell your whole car up and I think a lot of those
[36:09.860 --> 36:12.540]  varieties were lost along the way because people didn't have the
[36:12.540 --> 36:16.300]  filtration to grow them properly and because cannabis was so illegal not
[36:16.300 --> 36:19.220]  everybody wanted to grow that stuff there's much easier going stuff that
[36:19.220 --> 36:24.020]  didn't smell so much I think even in Europe they had problems with that
[36:24.020 --> 36:28.820]  burner is trying to bring out these smells again like gas piss grease burnt
[36:28.820 --> 36:34.500]  tire I think those things have you know you look at gas those are those things
[36:34.500 --> 36:38.780]  that'll never go away the gas profile burnt tire which is another part of that
[36:38.780 --> 36:43.340]  whole gas and like that chem dog and until you actually smell it and
[36:43.340 --> 36:46.460]  understand it it's burnt tires definitely in there in a lot of varieties
[36:46.460 --> 36:52.060]  and it's I consider it a desirable trait a desirable profile I think that burnt
[36:52.060 --> 36:56.740]  tire with the gas that classic og or that that chem that has especially the
[36:56.740 --> 37:02.820]  chem dog has that burnt tire so yeah those aren't going away anytime soon and
[37:02.820 --> 37:06.660]  I think there's a lot of people working on gas varieties what I would really
[37:06.660 --> 37:12.060]  like to see is a lot of you guys going in and taking stuff that's old or that's
[37:12.060 --> 37:15.300]  that working old varieties trying to bring in some new stuff because I think
[37:15.300 --> 37:20.900]  we're trying to bottleneck ourselves into this gelato and I had no idea when
[37:20.900 --> 37:23.900]  gelato came out that it was gonna be this big but I feel like gelato is
[37:23.900 --> 37:29.260]  bigger than cookies ever was right now and unbelievable not cookies the brand
[37:29.420 --> 37:34.900]  but cookies the the brain the genetics the plant the cookies crosses and all
[37:34.900 --> 37:37.980]  that stuff and that was like the there was the cookies and then there was the
[37:37.980 --> 37:42.260]  sure there was the sunset sherbert from Shabinsky and then there was gelato and
[37:42.260 --> 37:46.140]  gelato is just you know it's it's so big right now and everything's kind of
[37:46.140 --> 37:51.580]  getting bottlenecked towards that we're seeing stuff that's all color someone
[37:51.580 --> 37:55.380]  says I don't see any autos in the selection of your seeds mr. loud we have
[37:55.380 --> 38:02.340]  a yeah there's the og kush auto that's on daggett I love it should be Peter is
[38:02.340 --> 38:07.300]  that still up there by any chance wait sorry which one the the auto yep people
[38:07.300 --> 38:17.660]  are looking for a shadow yeah that is I can even put in the direct link to it
[38:17.660 --> 38:23.300]  that's the ganja farmer yeah I've been working on some gelato autos we had a
[38:23.300 --> 38:27.060]  lot of trouble stabilized I think I'm for the last few years we've been then
[38:27.060 --> 38:33.820]  met with the getting that flavor profile gelato and runs autos and but they have
[38:33.820 --> 38:36.860]  a tendency to have a lot of intersexual traits so it's something that needs to
[38:36.860 --> 38:42.300]  be bred out it just takes time but I'd love you know guys getting Durban poison
[38:42.300 --> 38:46.860]  try to get that Durban poison that leans towards the Durban and not towards the
[38:46.860 --> 38:51.500]  super silver haze if you guys are going to breed with Durban poison I see a lot
[38:51.500 --> 38:55.980]  of these Durban poison crosses and they have that real haze tropenolene limonene
[38:55.980 --> 39:00.740]  nose on them and for me that's a that's not necessarily what I would be looking
[39:00.740 --> 39:06.380]  for if I was doing selections I would be looking for that musky the African
[39:06.380 --> 39:11.020]  muskiness that you get from that Durban which is also super potent and super
[39:11.020 --> 39:18.580]  strong really interesting structure that's a nice that's in the cookies I
[39:18.580 --> 39:24.460]  believe firmly believe that it comes from Durban poison that licorice kind of
[39:24.460 --> 39:28.380]  smell well and they're what I would before act to cross Durban poison to
[39:28.380 --> 39:47.330]  something so let's see someone talking about Florida chocolate tie any grow
[39:47.330 --> 39:52.130]  tips yeah it's funny because you know chocolate tie tie sticks used to be used
[39:52.290 --> 39:55.890]  interchangeably by people that had no idea what they were but tie sticks and
[39:55.890 --> 40:01.170]  chocolate tie chocolate tie is a variety tie stick was like a marketing gimmick
[40:01.170 --> 40:06.210]  where they had a stick through and it was wrapped with either red or white
[40:06.210 --> 40:10.610]  string we got some back in the day in fact my partner Luke got some not too
[40:10.610 --> 40:14.370]  long ago maybe ten years ago he had it we put it in the safe for like years and
[40:14.370 --> 40:17.890]  we used to just pull it out and look at it we smoked it it was terrible tasting
[40:17.890 --> 40:24.370]  but chocolate ties a great variety really smooth silky tasting if you guys
[40:24.370 --> 40:28.690]  have access to getting that access to those seeds for breeding I think that's
[40:28.690 --> 40:32.690]  something that could be bred in and you can get some interesting stuff especially
[40:32.690 --> 40:37.090]  to complement like the creamy stuff people are breeding a lot of cream
[40:37.090 --> 40:41.410]  strains right now I think cream is kind of I don't know if we're moving past
[40:41.410 --> 40:45.890]  cream yet but the creamy varieties the soaps the stuff that kind of connected
[40:45.890 --> 40:51.650]  was doing cookies connected some of the hype stuff that was you know gassy and
[40:51.650 --> 40:56.130]  soapy and some of the stuff that was really creamy I think I was talking
[40:56.130 --> 41:00.210]  about that last year as being the future and I think that cream definitely has
[41:00.210 --> 41:04.930]  its place and I love that quality of a creamy smoke I think there's a lot of
[41:04.930 --> 41:09.970]  yeah for real connoisseurs that love to smoke and love the taste you know that
[41:09.970 --> 41:13.250]  are more than they're more about the smoke than the bag of fuel and other
[41:13.250 --> 41:18.690]  stuff cream is definitely a great quality someone says lambs bread yeah
[41:18.690 --> 41:23.130]  black licorice Durbin is the shit this is true that's that's the quality I'm
[41:23.130 --> 41:28.770]  looking for is that black licorice anise where it really translates usually the
[41:28.770 --> 41:34.450]  high to associated whenever I smoke stuff that has that anise has a really
[41:34.450 --> 41:42.770]  strong strong high you know like tight behind the eyes real powerful let's see
[41:43.570 --> 41:52.370]  milkshake cush orange cream 707 you know so there's this Malibu Marcia from
[41:52.370 --> 41:58.770]  exotic from from Mike and his Malibu Marcia has like this marshmallow taste
[41:58.770 --> 42:04.010]  but really it's it's like I'm not a big tangy fan by any means but it has a
[42:04.010 --> 42:07.130]  little hint of tangy in a good way to where it tastes like an orange
[42:07.130 --> 42:11.250]  creamsicle and there's definitely tangy in the genetics but it's not like tangy
[42:11.250 --> 42:15.850]  overpowering like oh god another tangy it's like fuck it smells a little bit
[42:15.850 --> 42:19.450]  like marshmallows and you taste it and it's like fucking orange creamsicle
[42:19.450 --> 42:22.650]  really good stuff
[42:23.330 --> 42:28.170]  og-18 and og-13 is the gas man there's a lot of gas out there if you have og
[42:28.170 --> 42:31.530]  Kusha better have gas in it that's the truth and someone's talking about lambs
[42:31.530 --> 42:37.290]  breath from Jamaica yes I haven't seen that one in a long time but I there's a
[42:37.290 --> 42:41.210]  guy that watched the show and he sent me some seeds so we'll see they're
[42:41.210 --> 42:48.610]  supposed to be authentic lambs bread seeds my friend Shane from which sunny
[42:48.610 --> 42:54.010]  Chiba sunny Chiba genetics he has a variety that he's made that has lambs
[42:54.010 --> 42:58.530]  bread has the turt profile down to the T I mean right if you've ever smoked or
[42:58.530 --> 43:04.650]  smelled lambs bread before his lambs bread crosses just a dead-on ringer and
[43:04.650 --> 43:10.410]  they were growing it at Harborside Gardens so so yeah what do you guys
[43:10.410 --> 43:13.370]  think about color I think it's on its way out I mean not permanently I think
[43:13.370 --> 43:18.370]  there's people love color don't get me wrong but in 2012 you couldn't get rid
[43:18.370 --> 43:21.130]  of stuff that had color and now everyone's got to have color in theirs
[43:21.130 --> 43:25.130]  so I feel like that color in your variety you know that's great but I feel
[43:25.130 --> 43:30.690]  like we need to go back to having the lime greens and the dark greens and all
[43:30.690 --> 43:36.010]  these other things that are equal to you know the color I think people get
[43:36.010 --> 43:42.970]  you know that's where I'm talking about the bottlenecking with the gelato's so
[43:42.970 --> 43:48.690]  black is back yeah if you can get some black herb you know I think that's
[43:48.690 --> 43:52.530]  definitely a quality that and it doesn't express every time you grow it super
[43:52.530 --> 43:58.370]  super dark but pink panties from from cookies sure Binsky's pink panties that
[43:58.370 --> 44:03.370]  made the sunset sherbert that pink panties was black it should have been
[44:03.370 --> 44:05.810]  called black panties I'm not sure why they called it pink panties but it
[44:05.810 --> 44:09.570]  sounded better maybe but black panties was you know that's what I would have
[44:09.570 --> 44:13.690]  called it and I what I used to grow that it would get black black like as black
[44:13.690 --> 44:19.730]  as I've ever seen any plant so
[44:20.530 --> 44:26.970]  Cambodian weed Cambodian weed in the 90s good stuff
[44:26.970 --> 44:31.650]  so yeah I mean black would be good but I don't see the whole market going towards
[44:31.650 --> 44:35.770]  black herb and just just being black herb like it is with color now because I
[44:35.770 --> 44:39.770]  feel like color kind of is dictating the market if you don't have color in your
[44:39.770 --> 44:44.090]  genetics your genetics aren't like taken super seriously right now and getting
[44:44.090 --> 44:49.370]  you're not getting the top dollar unless it's you know something special like a
[44:49.490 --> 44:52.850]  red Congolese for instance those guys growing it at Red Seal they got red
[44:52.850 --> 44:57.810]  Congolese they're getting top dollar for their stuff but you know I don't know if
[44:57.810 --> 45:05.130]  you guys have seen the rs-11 do farms rs-11 rs-7 stuff's amazing that's maybe
[45:05.130 --> 45:08.850]  I would have to say that's probably my favorite gelato variety that's available
[45:08.850 --> 45:13.050]  today so if you guys ever have a chance to get it one of the things that I think
[45:13.050 --> 45:16.890]  they did really well with the releasing it is they only gave it to growers that
[45:16.890 --> 45:21.050]  could grow really really really well so all the flower I've seen on the market
[45:21.050 --> 45:29.970]  is ridiculously amazing smells like when you go in like rainbow sherbet it smells
[45:29.970 --> 45:33.090]  like if you were to open a one gallon thing of the rainbow sure put your nose
[45:33.090 --> 45:36.570]  in it that's kind of a smell with a little bit of gas and it's got that
[45:36.570 --> 45:45.860]  cream it hits on every level so Mendo perps I almost black men no perps can
[45:45.860 --> 45:57.010]  get really really dark as well that's another good one juice box outside I
[45:57.010 --> 46:03.010]  would say October finishing outside we're looking at 63 days indoors it
[46:03.010 --> 46:07.290]  really did you know when you say when is the finishing time you know it depends
[46:07.290 --> 46:11.890]  on what region you're in those things are very specific to certain regions
[46:11.890 --> 46:14.810]  whether you're growing in yeah if you're going to San Diego or you're growing in
[46:14.810 --> 46:18.450]  Oregon or you're growing in California or Washington things finish at different
[46:18.450 --> 46:26.330]  times but yeah typically 63 indoors it's not a long finisher like some do
[46:26.330 --> 46:32.210]  you see that question James buy seeds from when he was coming up whose beans
[46:32.210 --> 46:36.530]  would he spend money on today when I was coming up I bought beans for everybody I
[46:36.530 --> 46:43.050]  used to go over to Amsterdam and I would buy greenhouse Barney's serious serious
[46:43.050 --> 46:47.330]  was my favorite you know I learned the backstory on serious seeds not to be
[46:47.330 --> 46:50.890]  confused with serious the guy who passed away that bred the animal cookies
[46:50.890 --> 46:56.690]  but a serious which is Simon from serious seeds I there I got a couple
[46:56.690 --> 47:00.570]  idols and I would say that he's one of the guys that I was able to meet and and
[47:00.570 --> 47:07.130]  I met him and maybe 2012 or 2013 but I really was I was buying his ak-47 and
[47:07.130 --> 47:12.330]  the thing about Simon what differentiates from him to these the guys
[47:12.330 --> 47:16.610]  now to Simon what makes him so special and different is he was doing it the
[47:16.610 --> 47:20.050]  right way it took him five years to breed I think four varieties like
[47:20.050 --> 47:26.770]  Cali mist ak-47 and what he did is he actually took land race varieties that
[47:26.770 --> 47:33.450]  he went and collected and stabilized those and made true f1 and what you do
[47:33.450 --> 47:37.530]  by doing that is like when you have stable to stable varieties you cross
[47:37.530 --> 47:42.170]  them together to make a true f1 that takes a lot of work and then you can
[47:42.170 --> 47:45.490]  take that to make an f1 hybrid with another thing like he did all the work
[47:45.650 --> 47:51.650]  and Simon was so meticulous over the years and his ak-47 you know I think if
[47:51.650 --> 47:55.490]  you got seeds of ak-47 you were getting the expression that he was looking for
[47:55.490 --> 48:00.250]  and there's not a lot of guys you pop the seed and you're gonna find exactly
[48:00.250 --> 48:04.250]  what that breeder was looking for yeah Simon was meticulous as fuck yep I
[48:04.250 --> 48:08.890]  agree and he's a really really intelligent guy and a really nice guy
[48:08.890 --> 48:13.170]  and he's one of those guys that you know he'll tell you everything you have
[48:13.170 --> 48:19.170]  questions he answers questions very humble and yeah so him and you know I
[48:19.170 --> 48:27.010]  was a big fan of greenhouse back in the day super silver haze you know even
[48:27.010 --> 48:31.930]  Selma you know a long time ago the Selma a plus we're looking at we're talking
[48:31.930 --> 48:35.130]  over ten years ago but the Selma a plus was something I had gotten in clone form
[48:35.130 --> 48:41.170]  and have still yet to get it in seed form but the clone that we had of it was
[48:41.170 --> 48:45.170]  a short finisher and it was a small plant but it finished real quickly
[48:45.170 --> 48:49.810]  there was a lot of leaf the the leaf ratio was bad on it but man it was gassy
[48:49.810 --> 48:53.010]  it was also called the rock bud because you'd get these really amazing dense
[48:53.010 --> 48:58.490]  rock nuggets out of there but uh you know someone says the ak-47 smells like
[48:58.490 --> 49:03.650]  sweet cheese aka ak-47 is pretty awesome same thing with Cali mist that's another
[49:03.650 --> 49:12.050]  good one yeah lambs bread we can keep on going back to lambs bread I just I
[49:12.050 --> 49:16.690]  really like lambs bread I think it has a nice muskiness that's very unique to
[49:16.690 --> 49:22.530]  lambs bread also going to Jamaica getting stuff from Jamaica there's
[49:22.530 --> 49:26.370]  Orange Hill which is a amazing variety if you ever have a chance to get some
[49:26.370 --> 49:32.130]  Orange Hill somewhere Orange Hill is a really oh yeah Simon never complained
[49:32.130 --> 49:36.490]  about everybody using ak-47 in their own projects as far as I know so here's
[49:36.490 --> 49:44.410]  my take on that if you sell seeds I sell seeds other people sell seeds you can't
[49:44.410 --> 49:48.410]  be upset that people are breeding with your seeds I think if they're making a
[49:48.410 --> 49:53.450]  f2 of your stuff there's there's a little bit of room to complain but the
[49:53.450 --> 49:58.650]  second you sell seeds as a breeder they become public domain that means you'll
[49:58.650 --> 50:03.050]  never be able to get a plant patent on that variety so if you really want to
[50:03.050 --> 50:06.770]  protect your genetics don't sell seeds you know and don't be offended when
[50:06.770 --> 50:10.170]  people start breeding with your stuff I mean people have started seed companies
[50:10.170 --> 50:15.450]  based on my seeds making stuff that you know they certain people have given me
[50:15.450 --> 50:17.970]  credit for stuff and certain people haven't and I'm not really worried about
[50:17.970 --> 50:23.010]  it might you know selling seeds I made money on those seeds I think that that
[50:23.010 --> 50:28.410]  right there you know that's the beauty you can you can make me on your jinx
[50:28.530 --> 50:31.930]  and to worry about other people breeding with your stuff and getting their name I
[50:31.930 --> 50:36.130]  mean it's it sucks that there's you know and people should be exposed that are
[50:36.130 --> 50:41.410]  lying about stuff I 100% agree about exposing people that lie but the second
[50:41.410 --> 50:46.290]  you sell a seed it becomes public domain and I appreciate the fact that people
[50:46.290 --> 50:49.170]  are breeding with my stuff that means that they think my work is good enough
[50:49.170 --> 50:54.490]  to you know bring that on to their own projects in the cannabis gene pool that
[50:54.490 --> 50:57.010]  they feel like hopefully that they feel like it's making the world a better
[50:57.010 --> 51:01.090]  place that the gene pool is improving because I think we go back and forth
[51:01.090 --> 51:04.450]  where we improve the cannabis gene pool but then we take away from it
[51:04.450 --> 51:07.810]  bottlenecking that happened in Europe with the hazes I think there was a lot
[51:07.810 --> 51:12.970]  of amazing genetics in the 80s 70s 80s early 90s and then they got so caught up
[51:12.970 --> 51:16.650]  on haze and how great haze was especially with hash and how strong it
[51:16.650 --> 51:21.890]  was that a lot of the great varieties were lost along the way and so
[51:21.890 --> 51:27.810]  preservation is important but a beat of this fucking type situation that we're
[51:27.810 --> 51:30.810]  going through like with gelato and I'm not saying gelato is bad I think it's
[51:30.810 --> 51:33.730]  it's amazing and we're just all caught up in it right now and there's nothing
[51:33.730 --> 51:36.770]  wrong with grunts and there's nothing wrong with gelato and these things taste
[51:36.770 --> 51:41.090]  amazing skittles is a great variety for smoke and for flavor it's a pain in the
[51:41.090 --> 51:44.730]  ass to grow but I love that these things are getting carried on other things we
[51:44.730 --> 51:49.130]  just need to kind of go back and stuff that we've preserved bring those back
[51:49.170 --> 51:54.250]  into some varieties to give us some diversity because diversity is what's
[51:54.250 --> 51:57.850]  going to keep the plant strong the more diversity we have the better quality the
[51:57.850 --> 52:01.570]  genetics we have if everything gets bred with the gelato and a gelato that this
[52:01.570 --> 52:06.810]  bottlenecking occurs and you basically start losing vigor and you you you
[52:06.810 --> 52:10.090]  basically especially stuff that has tendencies to Herm you got these
[52:10.090 --> 52:14.290]  hermaphrodites that are getting bred together you're gonna have offspring
[52:14.290 --> 52:18.330]  that has those intersexual traits
[52:19.170 --> 52:24.370]  so best real Hayes was in Washington Heights hands down yeah and that's the
[52:24.370 --> 52:28.690]  other thing is we got these opinions on stuff and it's so funny because I used
[52:28.690 --> 52:33.130]  to think that you know there I used to think of it being so black and white
[52:33.130 --> 52:35.970]  with a lot of stuff in this cat piss really has made me realize that
[52:35.970 --> 52:40.370]  sometimes there's more than one truth especially like with something like cat
[52:40.370 --> 52:44.170]  piss we have something that there is more than one truth because just because
[52:44.170 --> 52:47.570]  my story is the truth that I know doesn't mean that that person's story
[52:47.570 --> 52:50.570]  isn't the truth of the day no especially when they're given something
[52:50.570 --> 52:53.970]  as a name that this is cat piss it was given to them as cat piss well yeah
[52:53.970 --> 52:57.250]  maybe it's not the cat piss that I know maybe it's not the cat piss that you
[52:57.250 --> 53:00.610]  know and same thing with OG kush's there's all these OG kush's and there
[53:00.610 --> 53:04.970]  was these bag seeds that went around and not everybody has the best genetics it's
[53:04.970 --> 53:08.850]  just you know and people really hold on this stuff tightly especially things like
[53:08.850 --> 53:14.130]  OG kush cat piss the real deal and there were bag seeds there's there were
[53:14.130 --> 53:21.210]  inferior versions and there's inferior versions of everything wedding cake it's
[53:21.210 --> 53:24.930]  really interesting because jbz wedding cake is another one he sold seeds of and
[53:24.930 --> 53:29.690]  I've seen probably 30 different phenotypes of his wedding cake and there
[53:29.690 --> 53:33.690]  are some absolutely amazing ones the original one that we had out when it
[53:33.690 --> 53:37.730]  first popped off that was like the elite one that was kind of going around with
[53:37.730 --> 53:43.770]  all the elite breeders and the people who knew people was a gassy really really
[53:43.890 --> 53:49.450]  gassy it was slightly bready but not very bready it was really gassy had maybe
[53:49.450 --> 53:53.250]  not the best structure not as good as the the one that was really bready but
[53:53.250 --> 53:59.010]  it had that gas quality and the one that you see today that's predominant is
[53:59.010 --> 54:04.330]  really bready and it yields really it yields better I think probably tests a
[54:04.330 --> 54:07.530]  little bit higher but the original one was that and then I've seen 30 other
[54:07.530 --> 54:11.430]  ones in between that are all variations of that that some have really amazing
[54:11.430 --> 54:14.870]  structure but have no nose and because he sold seeds of it you get all these
[54:14.870 --> 54:18.550]  phenotypes well just because you have a phenotype doesn't mean you have the real
[54:18.550 --> 54:21.950]  one that's what a lot of people understand to that you have you have one
[54:21.950 --> 54:27.310]  but maybe it's not the one and stuff being kept alive in seed form you hear
[54:27.310 --> 54:30.390]  that we had the guy talking about the cactus that he has alive in seed form
[54:30.390 --> 54:34.270]  that doesn't really excite me when people say I've got this alive in seed
[54:34.270 --> 54:38.270]  form that doesn't mean that you're gonna be able to find what you're looking for
[54:38.270 --> 54:41.310]  in the seeds especially if you only have a handful of seeds you know we're
[54:41.310 --> 54:44.670]  talking about what I'm typically looking for and what I think you guys
[54:44.670 --> 54:48.630]  are looking for is outliers and those outliers are the ones that stand out
[54:48.630 --> 54:52.110]  when you pop a hundred seeds it might be that one or you pop a thousand seeds or
[54:52.110 --> 54:55.350]  two thousand or five thousand that one that's different that's better than all
[54:55.350 --> 55:00.730]  the rest and that's really what you're looking for
[55:00.730 --> 55:05.930]  Colorado cough man old-school cough you know we're I need to do a show on
[55:05.930 --> 55:09.530]  Portland on we got some great breeders coming from Portland too but yeah the
[55:09.530 --> 55:14.090]  cough is what made me think of that like old-school cough we had the four
[55:14.090 --> 55:19.490]  way the cough the dog shit was from Portland we could do a show just with
[55:19.490 --> 55:26.450]  the you know Mike from exotic fletch from you guys know Fletcher and then
[55:26.450 --> 55:32.010]  archive we could really do a great show strawberry cough that's another good
[55:32.010 --> 55:43.000]  one the one that Kyle Cushman and Danny Danko had not really fire genetics
[55:43.000 --> 55:46.960]  when you buy seeds well and see that's the thing is is like it really depends
[55:46.960 --> 55:50.560]  on your opinion someone's talking about not really being fire genetics when you
[55:50.560 --> 55:54.120]  buy seeds well that's not true I think there's breeders that breed really good
[55:54.120 --> 55:59.440]  stuff I think the magic is the Fino hunting part right so like just because
[55:59.440 --> 56:02.440]  you buy seeds you actually have to grow those seeds out and do selections and
[56:02.440 --> 56:06.080]  just because you buy a 10 pack of seeds from some good name variety doesn't mean
[56:06.080 --> 56:09.480]  you're gonna find a winner I don't typically find a winner in a 10 pack of
[56:09.480 --> 56:13.220]  seeds and sometimes I might find three but then I grow those three out again
[56:13.220 --> 56:18.160]  multiple times and then I decide which one's the best just because you got some
[56:18.160 --> 56:21.880]  $500 pack of seeds doesn't mean you're gonna find a winner or like what I was
[56:21.880 --> 56:26.960]  talking about Leo from aficionado his stuff that I saw on the secondary mark
[56:26.960 --> 56:30.880]  I was sold for a tooth a pack which was the best stuff ended up being you know
[56:30.880 --> 56:38.040]  I out of 800 seeds his were hands-down the best that year and that's not always
[56:38.040 --> 56:42.920]  the case I mean we've had problems with some of these guys that have sold $500
[56:42.920 --> 56:48.000]  packs that didn't germinate not to name any names but you know these are some of
[56:48.000 --> 56:52.320]  the truck things need to be tested out before you sell them as well so there's
[56:52.320 --> 56:56.520]  a whole bunch of important stuff what cultivars are you dropping on
[56:56.520 --> 56:59.360]  Valentine's Day we're gonna be announcing that shortly I got to
[56:59.360 --> 57:03.640]  discuss with the people that are selling them like Peter on his dagga love and
[57:03.640 --> 57:06.920]  James from seeds here now I think we're gonna do different ones on different
[57:06.920 --> 57:10.800]  sites but we're gonna have some fun stuff Adam Dunn and I are gonna be
[57:10.800 --> 57:15.120]  releasing more of the sage against the machine collaboration so we'll have
[57:15.120 --> 57:21.080]  those sage against the machine collaborations that are their sage and
[57:21.080 --> 57:27.440]  sour crosses that I had made and Adam is the market king so it was probably
[57:27.440 --> 57:31.760]  Valentine's Day is what we're looking for the Adam just sent me let's see if I
[57:31.760 --> 57:36.320]  can pull it up on my phone the artwork just to give you guys a glimpse into
[57:36.320 --> 57:51.590]  Adams magic see if you guys can see this
[57:51.830 --> 58:01.510]  sage against the machine it's the superhero from the rage cover so we're
[58:01.510 --> 58:06.830]  huge rage against the machine fans and we you know to honor them we're doing
[58:06.830 --> 58:10.750]  this collaboration together and we're gonna rename some of our varieties like
[58:10.750 --> 58:15.670]  killing in the name of and we had bomb sack was our Gio day kit n was killing
[58:15.670 --> 58:21.550]  in the name of and bomb sack was our GMO times sage and sour bulls on parade
[58:21.550 --> 58:28.470]  there you go and I feel like a lot of industry people can relate to what we
[58:28.470 --> 58:33.390]  relate to in that sense with rage against the machine and does anyone make
[58:33.390 --> 58:39.950]  seeds can I store but colloidal silver sure you can you might want to
[58:39.950 --> 58:44.950]  refrigerate I would you can make it yourself if you're making CS
[58:45.470 --> 58:50.150]  colloidal silver you can make it with a battery actually there's recipes online
[58:50.150 --> 58:54.750]  a lot of the stuff need that original sage and sour if your hybrids with it
[58:54.750 --> 58:57.790]  from the original stuff yeah so the original sage and sour the thing is is
[58:57.790 --> 59:00.790]  like what is the original sage and sour you're talking about the phenotype are
[59:00.790 --> 59:03.590]  you talking about the seed packs because I believe the seed packs have
[59:03.590 --> 59:07.390]  probably changed but that original sage and sour like people were buying a
[59:07.390 --> 59:11.670]  harborside if you're in the Bay Area yeah because there's some phenotypes
[59:11.670 --> 59:16.790]  that were leaning more towards the sour with the with a little bit of hint of
[59:16.790 --> 59:20.870]  the sage and then there was more kind of sagey phenos that had like a little
[59:20.870 --> 59:25.950]  haziness to them but they stacked really interesting the calyx were like foxtail
[59:25.950 --> 59:30.390]  fingers a lot of times but real sticky and greasy and gassy and that's the sage
[59:30.390 --> 59:36.350]  and sour that I absolutely love sage is a variety that Mojave Richmond created
[59:36.350 --> 59:43.310]  and Adam was part of that which is a sativa Afghani genetic equilibrium was
[59:43.310 --> 59:49.430]  what sage stood for and that was a OG Kush times big sir holy which is a haze
[59:49.430 --> 59:53.030]  and so that was somewhere in the middle there's different varieties but the one
[59:53.030 --> 01:00:00.030]  that was used to make the sage and sour that one was definitely the OG could in
[01:00:00.030 --> 01:00:03.990]  the middle OG cushion that you get the expressions on the sage and sour and so
[01:00:03.990 --> 01:00:07.950]  what I had done with that was I used three pollinators so I used three male
[01:00:07.950 --> 01:00:13.230]  plants out of an old pack of the sage and sour that I got from Adam and I took
[01:00:13.230 --> 01:00:16.990]  those three males and I put them in a room with a bunch of different varieties
[01:00:16.990 --> 01:00:21.790]  and so the idea was that we would get new f1 hybrids that would have a lot of
[01:00:21.790 --> 01:00:26.070]  genetic diversity some people only use one male or they use like clones off of
[01:00:26.070 --> 01:00:30.070]  that male I used three different males for genetic diversity that's only great
[01:00:30.070 --> 01:00:40.030]  in the f1 so you get some interesting comments here is it better using CS or
[01:00:40.030 --> 01:00:45.190]  STS what's going to work for me I have CS but no STS CS can work you need to
[01:00:45.190 --> 01:00:49.190]  apply it every day CS doesn't work and same thing with STS they don't work with
[01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:53.670]  every variety I'm working with a nano silver which is what I use now that my
[01:00:53.790 --> 01:00:57.990]  friend makes and nano silver is the shit it's the best thing I've ever used it
[01:00:57.990 --> 01:01:03.230]  reverses stuff that I never thought blue dream would reverse I tried CS I tried
[01:01:03.230 --> 01:01:08.830]  STS I tried a combination with gibberellic acid to try to tease the
[01:01:08.830 --> 01:01:13.110]  plant to reverse and that never worked and then all of a sudden my friend Tim
[01:01:13.110 --> 01:01:16.270]  comes with this nano silver and he's able to reverse blue dream like it's
[01:01:16.270 --> 01:01:22.590]  nothing so CS definitely works you need to apply it more STS you need to know
[01:01:22.590 --> 01:01:28.710]  your ratios STS works really well but it also does damage to the plant to the
[01:01:28.710 --> 01:01:34.270]  stomata and it can do the damage to the leafs so you need to you know apply it
[01:01:34.270 --> 01:01:39.590]  sparingly or as sparingly as possible you know some people use that one night
[01:01:39.590 --> 01:01:48.910]  one one to nine ratio with STS and other people use the like one to four ratio so
[01:01:48.990 --> 01:01:54.310]  let's see is it okay to breed with them for sure it's okay to breed with them I
[01:01:54.310 --> 01:01:59.830]  think if you look back years and years and years ago I was totally freaked out
[01:01:59.830 --> 01:02:04.350]  by the whole femme thing I was convinced that feminized was the devil you know and
[01:02:04.350 --> 01:02:08.230]  then I thought auto flower was the devil I thought this was bad it couldn't be
[01:02:08.230 --> 01:02:12.470]  good for the cannabis gene pool but they do it in all kinds of other crops and
[01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:16.670]  whether feminized like completely getting rid of males I don't think
[01:02:16.670 --> 01:02:20.870]  that's necessarily a good thing but I think breeding with feminized plants you
[01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:25.110]  can stabilize stuff you can breed good stuff in and out of it there's nothing
[01:02:25.110 --> 01:02:31.430]  wrong with breed you know you got stable genetics and by stable you know I'm not
[01:02:31.430 --> 01:02:35.550]  just talking about the intersexual traits that's important to try to breed
[01:02:35.550 --> 01:02:39.070]  out those intersexual traits oh there's someone this is all pass on autos you
[01:02:39.070 --> 01:02:43.470]  know I really thought that until I went into the garden and I saw Mephisto stuff
[01:02:43.470 --> 01:02:49.070]  the autos are a big game-changer and maybe they're not for you it doesn't
[01:02:49.070 --> 01:02:52.270]  have to be about you but there's definitely if you understand the market
[01:02:52.270 --> 01:02:56.470]  and you understand cannabis from an agricultural perspective you now have a
[01:02:56.470 --> 01:02:59.870]  plant that especially if you're going for biomass you know I think you can
[01:02:59.870 --> 01:03:03.230]  grow amazing auto plants for smoke too that don't even look like auto flower
[01:03:03.230 --> 01:03:09.790]  but for an agricultural application auto flowers are amazing because what you do
[01:03:09.790 --> 01:03:14.110]  is you have a plant that you may have to put more plants per acre but the
[01:03:14.110 --> 01:03:18.470]  finishes in 70 days from germination so you germinate 70 days later you harvest
[01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:23.870]  you can put 15,000 of those plants out per acre you can then get three harvest
[01:03:23.870 --> 01:03:29.350]  per acre in some reason or new harvest and by putting more plants out you can
[01:03:29.350 --> 01:03:35.950]  get two tons per acre it optimally but you know even that like 4,000 pounds per
[01:03:35.950 --> 01:03:39.390]  acre which would that's the kind of number you'd love to hit but even if you
[01:03:39.390 --> 01:03:43.790]  only got two off that acre if you're selling for biomass you know the new
[01:03:43.790 --> 01:03:48.430]  auto flowers have amazing terpenes they have higher cannabinoids I have some
[01:03:48.430 --> 01:03:54.430]  COAs that are you know testing 26 to 28 percent total cannabinoids 24% and
[01:03:54.430 --> 01:03:59.430]  that's not the average the average is still around 20 21 but I think if
[01:03:59.430 --> 01:04:03.470]  anybody that gets above 18 percent on their outdoor that's getting that many
[01:04:03.470 --> 01:04:09.150]  pounds from a agricultural standpoint that's amazing so that's my little
[01:04:09.150 --> 01:04:12.710]  speech on autos I and I believe that you know it's only gonna get better
[01:04:12.710 --> 01:04:16.910]  we're just you know we're in the infancy of breeding a lot of this stuff
[01:04:16.910 --> 01:04:25.070]  favorite CBD strain oh man there's so many good ones my favorite CBD strain I
[01:04:25.070 --> 01:04:31.510]  would say a spectrum that's a it's a real interesting longer it's a little
[01:04:31.510 --> 01:04:36.350]  bit longer but it's got an amazing profile it's higher CBD it's good it's
[01:04:36.350 --> 01:04:42.030]  been interesting my friend made some autos that were there semi autos with
[01:04:42.030 --> 01:04:46.070]  that and I think I've grown out a couple and I really like the turf profile and
[01:04:46.070 --> 01:04:51.310]  there was a big study released by Israel a couple weeks ago on the benefits of
[01:04:51.310 --> 01:04:56.310]  THCA and CBD a and so right now I'm gonna be popping a whole bunch of CBD
[01:04:56.310 --> 01:05:00.510]  and CBD autos because I have an immune disease I have an autoimmune disease
[01:05:00.510 --> 01:05:06.150]  called ulcerative colitis and one of the things was you know neurological
[01:05:06.150 --> 01:05:10.870]  for the neurological issues and diseases they were talking about THCA
[01:05:10.870 --> 01:05:18.590]  but gastrointestinal anti-inflammation is CBD a and you get that from harvesting
[01:05:18.590 --> 01:05:24.670]  your hemp plants that have high CBD and not decarboxyl izing them you're not
[01:05:24.670 --> 01:05:28.590]  doing the decarb process through them which heats it up and ruins the CBD a
[01:05:28.590 --> 01:05:34.070]  converts it to CBD so I think there's a lot of potential for that so I'm just
[01:05:34.070 --> 01:05:39.590]  diving right in and I'm gonna try it we'll see CBD a has a lot of potential
[01:05:39.590 --> 01:05:43.550]  yet I believe Deddy Mary from Israel and some of those guys out there have been
[01:05:43.550 --> 01:05:48.630]  doing some amazing stuff do you see this question what do you think of semi autos
[01:05:48.630 --> 01:05:55.150]  as future I think semi autos are amazing I think we haven't quite figured it out
[01:05:55.150 --> 01:06:00.510]  yet I think that we understand the potential of it and I think that nobody's
[01:06:00.510 --> 01:06:06.590]  released a semi auto that's where we need it to be but I feel like we're
[01:06:06.590 --> 01:06:10.390]  gonna go in that direction and I think the potential for semi autos and taking
[01:06:10.390 --> 01:06:16.190]  varieties that we really know and love as an alternate to auto flower is is
[01:06:16.190 --> 01:06:20.470]  great so now it's about getting stuff that you know if you understand that
[01:06:20.470 --> 01:06:25.630]  like f1s if we're gonna take two stable varieties cross those together one auto
[01:06:25.630 --> 01:06:30.190]  flower that's stable one photo period that's a stable homozygous plant you
[01:06:30.190 --> 01:06:34.270]  cross those together you get one plant that's right in the middle I mean I
[01:06:34.270 --> 01:06:39.550]  think there's really good potential for that so but then you start talking about
[01:06:39.550 --> 01:06:42.990]  what traits does it pass on that's where the research needs to get done can you
[01:06:42.990 --> 01:06:49.510]  tell people what a semi auto is so semi auto is the semi auto is half photo
[01:06:49.510 --> 01:06:55.030]  period half auto flower and you need both of the auto so you need both of the
[01:06:55.030 --> 01:06:58.990]  parents to have that auto flower recessive trait for it to express so in
[01:06:58.990 --> 01:07:03.430]  that first f1 you're not getting an auto flower progeny the population is
[01:07:03.430 --> 01:07:07.590]  going to be a semi auto and what that does is it means you have a variety that
[01:07:07.590 --> 01:07:12.030]  finishes faster than your your typical photo period that you used and then also
[01:07:12.030 --> 01:07:17.030]  triggers faster so you can have stuff that's finishing in June which means you
[01:07:17.030 --> 01:07:22.430]  don't need it to go below 12 12 to start flowering you know and we're talking
[01:07:22.430 --> 01:07:27.590]  about the resistance one thing I love about seeds is their vigor and they're
[01:07:27.670 --> 01:07:31.110]  typically you're gonna have seeds that don't have problems that we have with
[01:07:31.110 --> 01:07:38.590]  clones like viruses and bugs and stuff that occurs from age so yeah
[01:07:38.590 --> 01:07:42.550]  diamond dinofem has been killing it for years breeding quality autos I mean
[01:07:42.550 --> 01:07:46.430]  that's I feel like yeah dinofem I saw there's back in the day and there's
[01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:50.670]  there's didn't excite me their their auto flowers did not excite me like the
[01:07:50.670 --> 01:07:54.830]  ones I've seen in the last book you know last five years the stuff Mephisto has
[01:07:54.830 --> 01:07:57.710]  been working on the gear that people are now really breeding I mean I think
[01:07:57.710 --> 01:08:02.950]  there's a lot of guys breeding fast buds is doing some cool stuff a lot of guys
[01:08:02.950 --> 01:08:06.710]  in Europe are really kind of crushing it on the autos and really breeding stuff
[01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:11.230]  you know it takes three generations for it to be auto so that the f3 I mean I
[01:08:11.230 --> 01:08:15.470]  typically f4 is where you're gonna get 100% autos if you guys are breeding
[01:08:15.470 --> 01:08:19.630]  stuff into auto lines and trying to breed stuff yeah can you actually talk
[01:08:19.630 --> 01:08:25.910]  about that for a second like if you take regular and auto as the parents
[01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:34.630]  what what's the process and so you know the election all seeds are auto yes so
[01:08:34.630 --> 01:08:38.910]  typically the f4 I can never find Mephisto in stock lol yeah that's a
[01:08:38.910 --> 01:08:41.950]  tough one but wait basically it takes what happens is you get that semi-auto
[01:08:41.950 --> 01:08:46.110]  with your f1 when you cross those two together and then when you take those
[01:08:46.110 --> 01:08:50.350]  those plants and you reverse some of you're gonna feminize or you have a
[01:08:50.350 --> 01:08:55.550]  regular and seeds where you have a male female for your donor receiver you cross
[01:08:55.550 --> 01:08:59.630]  those back upon itself then with your seeds what you do for your selection
[01:08:59.630 --> 01:09:04.990]  process would be keep the light on 24 hours a day and whatever flowers that's
[01:09:04.990 --> 01:09:07.550]  going to be what you use for your selection so that you can start
[01:09:07.550 --> 01:09:13.950]  selecting that recessive trait that basically occurs there so then by the f3
[01:09:13.950 --> 01:09:18.270]  you should have the majority of your stuff auto flower and f4 you'll have
[01:09:18.270 --> 01:09:26.430]  everything auto flowering so it's not as hard breed as people think really the
[01:09:26.430 --> 01:09:31.390]  selection is what's challenging you know I was just working on some selections
[01:09:31.390 --> 01:09:36.590]  yeah Leo's wondering if he should connect what do you guys think I think
[01:09:36.590 --> 01:09:42.790]  the crowd would erupt yeah he said the rain cleared up a little bit I'm gonna
[01:09:42.790 --> 01:09:50.880]  tell him the crowd will erupt that could be a good or a bad thing
[01:09:54.860 --> 01:10:00.700]  the panties and bras will be thrown on stage yeah so when you're breeding auto
[01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:06.420]  flowers you got one shot at it because you don't keep your clones alive so you
[01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:12.340]  go in your room you do your selections in your in your rooms as you're making
[01:10:12.340 --> 01:10:17.580]  seed so you know towards the end of that that photo period or not photo
[01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:21.620]  period but end of that's normally 70 days that's extended out that period is
[01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:26.020]  extended to about a hundred days of your making seeds for getting those seeds to
[01:10:26.020 --> 01:10:31.100]  fully mature now towards the end of that from day 70 to day 100 on a typical
[01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:33.740]  auto flower that finishes in 70 days that's where you want to go phenol hunt
[01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:38.700]  and that's where you go in every day you smell the plants if you saw my feet you
[01:10:38.700 --> 01:10:42.300]  could see my buddies nose completely covered in hairs and resin and all kinds
[01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:46.220]  of nasty stuff from him really getting in deep we went through 1,300 different
[01:10:46.220 --> 01:10:51.420]  plants to select our future projects you know stuff that we're breeding towards
[01:10:51.420 --> 01:10:55.820]  some of them were stuff that we smelled because we were creating new f1s we're
[01:10:55.820 --> 01:10:59.340]  testing out some gear from other people and seeing how they perform and how they
[01:10:59.340 --> 01:11:04.340]  perform next to our stuff that we're working on and that next generation
[01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:07.700]  you're going through in your phenol hunting and that that one you select
[01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:11.020]  that's the one you use for breeding and that's how you improve the quality of
[01:11:11.020 --> 01:11:14.620]  your auto flowers what a lot of people are doing is they're buying a 10 pack or
[01:11:14.620 --> 01:11:18.580]  a hundred pack and they're just reversing a handful of them and putting
[01:11:18.580 --> 01:11:21.100]  those on the rest well they're not doing any selection process so they're
[01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:25.220]  typically going to be taking away from the quality of the genetics that they
[01:11:25.220 --> 01:11:29.340]  purchased now if you go out those that you grow them out a couple times and
[01:11:29.340 --> 01:11:34.300]  then you start figuring out okay well this one or these ones are you selective
[01:11:34.300 --> 01:11:38.580]  we pick your donors and receivers and then you only use those your quality of
[01:11:38.580 --> 01:11:42.780]  seed will get better and better so I see that as one of the big problems people
[01:11:42.780 --> 01:11:46.380]  trying to knock off I can name a couple companies but I'm not going to but
[01:11:46.380 --> 01:11:50.300]  companies knocking off auto flowers from other people is they just make auto
[01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:54.020]  flowers from their seed whatever they get and then they reverse some they
[01:11:54.020 --> 01:11:58.020]  don't have any selection process and it's not an open pollination but what
[01:11:58.020 --> 01:12:01.220]  they're doing is they're just not doing any selection so they could be reversing
[01:12:01.220 --> 01:12:04.100]  stuff that's not really good and putting it on stuff that's not really
[01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:07.060]  good and then you're in the you end up buying those seeds that aren't really
[01:12:07.060 --> 01:12:11.300]  good whereas if you do a selection process and you select that donor
[01:12:11.300 --> 01:12:15.980]  receiver batch of seeds and a lot of times you'll use the same plant you know
[01:12:15.980 --> 01:12:21.500]  as donor and receiver depending on what you're trying to do but you know that's
[01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:26.620]  how you improve your quality oh we got Leo
[01:12:26.620 --> 01:12:32.620]  I've been talking talking straight what time is it is 1219 I'm glad you're back
[01:12:32.620 --> 01:12:41.300]  bro James held down the fort is he frozen in place or is he just looking
[01:12:41.300 --> 01:12:45.540]  pretty frozen in place so Leo one thing you could do is kill your video and just
[01:12:45.540 --> 01:12:49.740]  do audio only and then kind of on
[01:12:49.740 --> 01:13:00.350]  up yeah pixelated me all right there we go yeah maybe kill your video and just
[01:13:00.350 --> 01:13:15.390]  do audio only have you heard that I did not you I like his frozen screen that
[01:13:15.390 --> 01:13:42.160]  is very happy how many million do you make this year three million I'm sorry I
[01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:50.880]  so wanna be here I really wanna Sunday don't fuck around tune in the James Loud
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:14:05.840]  show cuz I'm gonna fucking be on this and and yeah I'm gonna be how do I kill
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:14.240]  the video so tap the yeah there you go and then you're you're not trying to
[01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:18.160]  stream on you you're not trying to watch this on YouTube either so kill
[01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:30.500]  anything else that's competing for bandwidth but let's hear you talk can
[01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:39.230]  you hear us okay he said he turned off the camera fingers crossed I can hear
[01:14:39.230 --> 01:14:54.200]  you let's hear a giggle giggle if you can hear us so someone said do we carry
[01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:59.460]  any sativas yeah we got a jaw fata with the ganja farmer seed company that is
[01:14:59.460 --> 01:15:04.060]  definitely it's a super sativa it's actually a shorter finishing sativa
[01:15:04.060 --> 01:15:08.860]  which is what I like about it it you know it's like a 10 weaker roughly the
[01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:16.660]  amnesia times it's amnesia times what is it yeah I get high and then I forget but
[01:15:16.660 --> 01:15:23.500]  it's a super lemon haze so someone has his wife is wants me to run some Hawaiian
[01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:32.620]  and she's some yeah it's funny like people that grow OG cushion in the
[01:15:32.620 --> 01:15:37.540]  Hawaiian and not necessarily Hawaiian but in tropical regions and then try to
[01:15:37.540 --> 01:15:41.900]  grow tropical varieties in places that aren't meant for that and you can do
[01:15:41.900 --> 01:15:46.980]  that sometimes but I feel like it's not always optimal so you guys know your
[01:15:46.980 --> 01:15:52.980]  regions aloha Greg McAllister how you doing you know Greg's a great guy who
[01:15:52.980 --> 01:15:59.900]  comes on the show a lot in our chat and has some great opinions on stuff yo yo
[01:15:59.900 --> 01:16:06.780]  I'm still on if you guys could hear me oh Leo's back how you doing Leo like
[01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:10.940]  ghost episode like I could hear you but I can only communicate with somebody
[01:16:10.940 --> 01:16:18.260]  through the chat messenger excellent man glad to have you back all right sorry if
[01:16:18.260 --> 01:16:26.600]  I interrupted somebody but I think I'm just gonna I'm just gonna sign up tell
[01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:29.640]  everybody yo thank you for tuning it thanks for the support thanks for the
[01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:40.860]  love and thanks for being me and thank you for just being awesome awesome yeah
[01:16:40.860 --> 01:16:45.780]  Leo man we'll get you back on the show we'll drive down into town maybe or we
[01:16:45.780 --> 01:16:51.100]  can meet up you can come out to the house anytime and we can do one live
[01:16:51.100 --> 01:17:01.310]  we'll set we'll send some bonded t1 lines up to his house so someone says I
[01:17:01.310 --> 01:17:06.590]  know my region but you keep suggesting California outdoor only varieties Wow
[01:17:06.590 --> 01:17:11.230]  someone's got some loud Ganita has got a freebie pack hidden fire dude you should
[01:17:11.230 --> 01:17:14.510]  hold on to that I don't even have the loud Ganita's anymore that was a so I
[01:17:14.510 --> 01:17:17.390]  used to work with log Anita's the brewery before they got bought for
[01:17:17.390 --> 01:17:21.830]  Heineken even after they got bought for Heineken but those are super super rare
[01:17:21.830 --> 01:17:28.750]  the loud Ganita's that was a my ex-partner and he did a contest with the
[01:17:28.750 --> 01:17:33.290]  naming thing and someone came up with that in a contest so yeah we'll get Leo
[01:17:33.290 --> 01:17:35.870]  on here one of these days I'll either have him come down to the house and we
[01:17:35.870 --> 01:17:39.830]  could film it or I'll go up there we'll get him to go into town and we'll film
[01:17:39.830 --> 01:17:43.950]  it I have a lot of great questions for him some interesting stuff about Europe
[01:17:43.950 --> 01:17:53.900]  him and I are both working on and off in Europe so yeah and someone said hey
[01:17:54.020 --> 01:17:59.140]  James I'm hearing you talk about CBD a and you see I'm involved heavily in the
[01:17:59.140 --> 01:18:05.420]  hemp side and CBGA CBG are going to be the most anti-inflammatory for the gut
[01:18:05.420 --> 01:18:12.940]  can you get CBG number one from seeds or you can get to yeah that's great so
[01:18:12.940 --> 01:18:16.940]  that's it that's a great tip guys if you're looking for some CBG CBG is a
[01:18:16.940 --> 01:18:22.820]  precursor so CBG is great too for anti-inflammatory I'm going for that
[01:18:22.820 --> 01:18:37.550]  CBD a and also CBG so oh someone says spin us spin of this update you know
[01:18:37.550 --> 01:18:42.310]  that oh there's dark horse spin of this update they're going to be doing a live
[01:18:42.310 --> 01:18:47.350]  span of this since it's taking so long and so what they're gonna do with that
[01:18:47.350 --> 01:18:52.230]  is we're gonna all be there dark horse genetics myself Mike from exotics we had
[01:18:52.230 --> 01:18:56.590]  a booth together did spin of this last year and that's kind of you know because
[01:18:56.590 --> 01:19:00.870]  of travel and kovat and everything else they've been stalling us out we paid
[01:19:00.870 --> 01:19:05.270]  for this awesome booth so I guess they're gonna I just got a notification
[01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:07.830]  this morning when I was flipping through my emails that they're gonna be doing a
[01:19:07.830 --> 01:19:13.550]  live spin of this online one and so we'll have an opportunity there we'll
[01:19:13.550 --> 01:19:19.310]  see what that entails I have no idea but uh yeah I got dungeon vault was also
[01:19:19.310 --> 01:19:24.350]  gonna be at the booth and Adam done I believe so we had the super booth planned
[01:19:24.390 --> 01:19:29.070]  yeah our booth buddies man these guys are all solid we I feel like we had some
[01:19:29.070 --> 01:19:33.390]  of the best variety of seeds when we did it last time and now you're getting
[01:19:33.390 --> 01:19:38.750]  exotic out there too we yeah the super team bunch of superheroes out there and
[01:19:38.750 --> 01:19:44.430]  in Spain and love Spain love Barcelona love my friends there
[01:19:46.270 --> 01:19:50.670]  actually I haven't told that story but that was pretty crazy you know I was
[01:19:50.670 --> 01:19:54.190]  over there we had everything shipped over for our booth we never actually
[01:19:54.270 --> 01:20:00.510]  set it up went through I had my friends over there had Marlon flew Marlon over
[01:20:00.510 --> 01:20:07.670]  there he was gonna perform at the Terp tower and this was right kovat and we
[01:20:07.670 --> 01:20:10.470]  were like it's gonna be fine it's man of his kept saying yeah yeah we're doing it
[01:20:10.470 --> 01:20:14.750]  anyway yeah we're doing it anyway we're gonna do spanner this this year and I
[01:20:14.750 --> 01:20:18.190]  was still skeptical but I was gonna go over there anyway I think Mike from
[01:20:18.190 --> 01:20:22.430]  exotic never actually made it over for the booth which smart decision on his
[01:20:22.430 --> 01:20:29.670]  part and you know right you to rock and roll I dark horse didn't make it over
[01:20:29.670 --> 01:20:32.550]  either yeah him and Caesar were supposed to be over there and didn't end up
[01:20:32.550 --> 01:20:38.590]  showing up which smart move on their part but we literally would go Wednesday
[01:20:38.590 --> 01:20:43.590]  to Thursday night Thursday morning super early Trump made this announcement on
[01:20:43.590 --> 01:20:50.270]  the television that there was no international travel and literally my
[01:20:50.270 --> 01:20:52.990]  friends started to scatter I had friends that were heading 45 minutes
[01:20:52.990 --> 01:20:56.710]  after that they were heading towards the airport Marlon was heading towards the
[01:20:56.710 --> 01:21:00.990]  airport Marlon Asher my partner and reggae singer he was heading to the
[01:21:00.990 --> 01:21:04.870]  airport they all had to get back I had some business I had to take care of
[01:21:04.870 --> 01:21:11.190]  stuff we I have leaving seeds over there that you know with my partners I'm doing
[01:21:11.190 --> 01:21:14.350]  some seed stuff over there so luckily I had partners I could leave seeds our
[01:21:14.350 --> 01:21:18.510]  booth stuff our banners all that stuff sitting over there and it's just it's
[01:21:18.510 --> 01:21:23.230]  still sitting over there in hopes that we can do spina busy again we ended up
[01:21:23.230 --> 01:21:29.950]  taking off on Friday I never got tested for Kovac but I literally had a cough I
[01:21:29.950 --> 01:21:33.590]  never had any fever I had a cough and I had like a little bit of chest pain but
[01:21:33.590 --> 01:21:38.150]  that didn't go away for almost a month and so I probably had Kovac you never
[01:21:38.150 --> 01:21:43.750]  know but yeah what a trip so and I've been doing spina bus on and off for a
[01:21:43.750 --> 01:21:51.150]  long time there's a strangest thing strangest experience over there yeah
[01:21:51.150 --> 01:21:55.230]  good times though hopefully we'll have a spina bus again sometime soon man I'm
[01:21:55.230 --> 01:22:00.470]  really it's one of my favorite events of the year Emerald Cup spina bus they're
[01:22:00.470 --> 01:22:04.310]  always a joy to see people that I haven't seen in a long time you know if
[01:22:04.310 --> 01:22:07.350]  we can pay for it by selling some seeds that's even better but you know just
[01:22:07.350 --> 01:22:11.390]  just being able to see friends that I haven't seen in a year typically like
[01:22:11.390 --> 01:22:17.150]  spina bus there's people I only see during spina bus so yeah dark horse
[01:22:17.150 --> 01:22:20.870]  genetics Bruce Banner you guys that's an awesome one his some of his Bruce
[01:22:20.870 --> 01:22:26.430]  Banner crosses are awesome dark horse makes some really cool stuff we'll get
[01:22:26.430 --> 01:22:31.310]  him on the show one of these weeks I'm ready so he had an awesome event in
[01:22:31.310 --> 01:22:39.190]  Vegas I guess it's a little over a year ago yeah that was awesome we'll get him
[01:22:39.190 --> 01:22:42.150]  on the show to talk about that is I'm sure he's probably planning future ones
[01:22:42.150 --> 01:22:45.710]  Boston Freedom Rally never been to Boston Freedom Rally believe it or not
[01:22:45.710 --> 01:22:52.390]  but I have a lot of friends that go yeah so who would you guys like to see on the
[01:22:52.390 --> 01:22:56.170]  show there's a lot of guys I mean I've got suggestions that people want Mike to
[01:22:56.170 --> 01:23:03.370]  come on compound dark horse what would you guys like earlier and I think people
[01:23:03.370 --> 01:23:10.130]  wanted to see that yeah I think that'd be great get dark horse he's he's always
[01:23:10.130 --> 01:23:15.210]  got some cool shit for sure genetics wise and kind of pushing the envelope
[01:23:15.210 --> 01:23:31.380]  HBK dad Mephisto they must mean Daz Don and Aaron yeah I think we'll try to get
[01:23:31.380 --> 01:23:35.540]  Don and Aaron those guys are super busy I'm sure you know running the seed world
[01:23:35.700 --> 01:23:46.740]  here but we'll see if we can get them on try comb jungle ethos Colin and his
[01:23:46.740 --> 01:23:50.980]  Pluto you're not going to talk about that two different Pluto's by the way if
[01:23:50.980 --> 01:23:55.100]  you guys are confused his Pluto is an auto I believe and the real Pluto is
[01:23:55.100 --> 01:23:59.940]  completely different from Northern California sticky farms with
[01:23:59.940 --> 01:24:04.700]  collaboration with gas house that that is one of my favorite varieties you guys
[01:24:04.700 --> 01:24:08.260]  ever have a chance to try the the California Pluto I guess is what we can
[01:24:08.260 --> 01:24:12.780]  call it but that's I believe it's like a gelato wedding cake cross and it's like
[01:24:12.780 --> 01:24:18.740]  perfumey and gassy and leaves that taste on your tongue for like you know half
[01:24:18.740 --> 01:24:26.540]  hour after you're done smoking it Elon Musk yeah that's gonna happen we'll get
[01:24:26.540 --> 01:24:33.100]  him on next week for sure all we can do is ask yeah I mean relentless that'd be
[01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:42.940]  great lump status we get yeah lumpy and Todd McCormick green shock there's so
[01:24:42.940 --> 01:24:45.140]  many great people that we can have on the show that's what I love about it
[01:24:45.140 --> 01:24:49.060]  with breeding and genetics and the potential for great guys there's so many
[01:24:49.060 --> 01:24:53.980]  good guys and I'd love to have them tell their stories you know Ariane would he's
[01:24:53.980 --> 01:24:58.620]  got great stories for sure love to get Ariane on here also we need to get some
[01:24:58.620 --> 01:25:03.700]  hemp guys on one of these days I've been talking about it I think that beacon
[01:25:03.700 --> 01:25:09.020]  hemp and beacon hemp and heroes the farmer doing some really awesome stuff
[01:25:09.020 --> 01:25:12.420]  I'd like to try to get them on here you know they're gonna have certified seeds
[01:25:12.420 --> 01:25:16.180]  oh I think they'll be having some of the sort of the first certified hemp seeds
[01:25:16.180 --> 01:25:25.060]  in Oregon can s test Tommy Chong yaki canerado would be cool 24-hour
[01:25:25.060 --> 01:25:29.140]  fundraising stream you Adam can do that I'm not doing a 24-hour stream with
[01:25:29.140 --> 01:25:36.820]  Peter that's not our cup of tea James is short and sweet yeah I like yeah and and
[01:25:36.820 --> 01:25:41.580]  the fundraiser is it's like everybody wants to do them and then you know I was
[01:25:41.580 --> 01:25:46.580]  telling James before we went live I had people twice this morning and as I was
[01:25:46.580 --> 01:25:50.660]  you know pushing my two-year-old daughter to the farmers market of people
[01:25:50.660 --> 01:25:56.980]  being like the stuff I won like three months ago and that fundraiser still
[01:25:56.980 --> 01:26:01.460]  hasn't arrived and I you know basically everyone looks at me when shit goes
[01:26:01.460 --> 01:26:10.380]  wrong even though I feel like I'm just kind of like the airwaves but uh you
[01:26:10.380 --> 01:26:17.140]  know be like blaming NBC of something happened at the Oscars or something
[01:26:17.140 --> 01:26:25.420]  yeah I blame mr. Toad brings up how about your your first female well
[01:26:25.420 --> 01:26:36.180]  actually you had one female as part of a group but some female breeders it's
[01:26:36.180 --> 01:26:38.660]  funny because I've talked to some females that I wanted on the show and
[01:26:38.660 --> 01:26:42.620]  everyone's scared I think you know who you are you probably watch the show but
[01:26:42.620 --> 01:26:50.180]  don't be afraid yeah I'd love to get some female thug pugs another one you
[01:26:50.180 --> 01:26:55.820]  know I think J BZ is one that I've heard a bunch people crock it you know getting
[01:26:55.820 --> 01:27:00.660]  Dave on here would be amazing Leo we will get Leo on here we had Jill yeah
[01:27:00.660 --> 01:27:05.260]  you're right we had miss Jill she's a female breeder she was the first don't
[01:27:05.260 --> 01:27:09.940]  be afraid I'm on the show if you guys have recommendations you have friends
[01:27:09.940 --> 01:27:13.620]  that you'd like to get on the show send me a message James loud genetics at
[01:27:13.620 --> 01:27:24.900]  gmail.com let's see congresswoman greenstone live so we can see oh god oh
[01:27:24.900 --> 01:27:31.020]  god symbiotic I think you know there's a lot of potential for stuff
[01:27:31.020 --> 01:27:37.500]  gypsy Nirvana in here CSI humble I would love to have CSI humble I don't know I
[01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:40.780]  don't know him personally but I think he would be a great addition I think he
[01:27:40.780 --> 01:27:47.860]  does some amazing things same thing with Canerado I do know Canerado I haven't
[01:27:47.860 --> 01:27:50.940]  asked him to be on the show yet but he would be great I feel like he does
[01:27:50.940 --> 01:27:54.700]  something special and different I mean he's made more genetics than anybody I
[01:27:54.700 --> 01:27:59.300]  think and I'm almost more than most people combined with his feminized stuff
[01:27:59.300 --> 01:28:03.780]  and he has a way of selecting stuff that works really well together maybe he has
[01:28:03.780 --> 01:28:08.100]  some intersexual trade issues with some of this stuff but the guy just pumps out
[01:28:08.100 --> 01:28:16.900]  genetics and pumps out awesome different stuff and source genetics OG Cushman
[01:28:16.900 --> 01:28:22.980]  yeah get him a cap get cap someone outside the USA you know I was thinking
[01:28:22.980 --> 01:28:27.780]  about Soma Soma has a lot of interesting stories love Soma he's like family to me
[01:28:27.780 --> 01:28:32.380]  I don't know if you guys know Soma from Soma sacred seeds he's created a bunch
[01:28:32.380 --> 01:28:37.140]  of stuff and he has a lot of history with the plant he has a lot of history
[01:28:37.140 --> 01:28:42.500]  with the Grateful Dead going way back to shows and Oregon and Florida and New
[01:28:42.500 --> 01:28:48.580]  York and you know New York City diesel which is different than sour diesel
[01:28:48.580 --> 01:28:55.220]  Riley has a threesome he'd like to see paired up you want that live with boxing
[01:28:55.220 --> 01:29:04.580]  gloves so my house amnesia so amnesia Hayes is Soma's and super lemon is aria
[01:29:04.580 --> 01:29:08.820]  for his greenhouse which are they're very similar I would say their sister
[01:29:08.820 --> 01:29:12.940]  plants you know I I'm not an expert on that and I wasn't there when they're
[01:29:12.940 --> 01:29:18.340]  created but they grow very similar in structure in terpene profile very
[01:29:18.340 --> 01:29:33.320]  similar yet different I know we're getting some hate on here too it just
[01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:36.320]  was kind of funny yeah I'd be great to have be real talking about some stuff
[01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:41.000]  I'd like to have him clear out you know we'll hit him up and see if he can come
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:48.920]  on talk about cat piss og coast back in the day let's see grapefruit New York
[01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:51.400]  City grapefruit that's the best description of New York City diesel if
[01:29:51.400 --> 01:29:55.120]  you guys have never seen it it is a straight grapefruit smelling plant it
[01:29:55.120 --> 01:30:00.880]  has a funk to it and it has a real strong grapefruit nose on it I'm a huge
[01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:07.280]  fan of it for stuff I you know I bred and I worked with it a little bit and
[01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:12.480]  same thing with amnesia we got the amnesia super lemon Hayes those are the
[01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:22.280]  jaw fatas yeah so mango so mangoes interesting so a plus which I talked
[01:30:22.280 --> 01:30:30.640]  about earlier the lavender you know Selma's lavender was awesome NYC D is
[01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:37.160]  completely different than ECSD see I people get mad the ECSD guys are like
[01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:41.240]  fucking New York City diesel and the New York City diesel guys that are going
[01:30:41.240 --> 01:30:44.960]  that are like oh yeah you see these ECSD isn't that good and it's like there's
[01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:48.520]  this hate between people New Yorkers especially you know how they can get
[01:30:48.520 --> 01:30:53.600]  real intense about stuff and worked up that that's definitely a conversation
[01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:58.480]  with the ECSD guys that that if almost not even almost but definitely offends
[01:30:58.480 --> 01:31:05.000]  ECSD guys and ECSD is one of my favorite all-time favorite strange worked with
[01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:09.440]  that a ton try stabilizing it did some different stuff back crossing and
[01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:14.080]  stabilizing it New York City diesel has no gas correct
[01:31:14.120 --> 01:31:19.000]  fuck the hate you guys are badass I have been drawing for 20 years and I'm still
[01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:24.360]  over bro science yeah I'm over bro science too and you know I'll be honest
[01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:28.480]  with you guys I'm learning stuff from my shows and I'm learning stuff talking to
[01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:33.120]  different people stuff that I thought was fact that I had heard from some of
[01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:36.920]  the top breeders in the world I'm just now learning genetically is incorrect
[01:31:36.920 --> 01:31:42.840]  and it's really interesting the more we talk about stuff even if people are
[01:31:42.840 --> 01:31:46.560]  getting all pissed off the more we talk about we the more we learn and the more
[01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:49.400]  we can get through some of this stuff and really start understanding science
[01:31:49.400 --> 01:31:53.640]  breeding science you know there there was some books out and there was a
[01:31:53.640 --> 01:31:57.440]  little bit of this but unless you go into books on plants not on this a
[01:31:57.440 --> 01:32:02.000]  cannabis you're not going to get all of the important stuff and you know my book
[01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:06.560]  that I've been working on it's going to be out sooner than later I hope but I'm
[01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:09.940]  really able to get some interesting stuff that I thought was correct in to
[01:32:09.940 --> 01:32:15.780]  the book we'll get the real real stuff in there because the other thing you
[01:32:15.780 --> 01:32:19.260]  know it's kind of scary coming from a breeders perspective of a guy that
[01:32:19.260 --> 01:32:23.700]  doesn't have a degree and some of my science may have been wrong and I'm glad
[01:32:23.700 --> 01:32:27.940]  I'm able to correct it because that's in there forever for once you put it in
[01:32:27.940 --> 01:32:32.180]  it it goes in there for life and then you can either be known as that dude who
[01:32:32.180 --> 01:32:36.380]  almost had it right or the dude who had it right and I'm hoping to be that guy
[01:32:36.380 --> 01:32:39.700]  that had it right Joe Rogan I would love to have Joe Rogan everybody would love
[01:32:39.700 --> 01:32:45.540]  to have Joe Rogan on their show I think Joe Rogan is a you know the man the
[01:32:45.540 --> 01:32:49.580]  smart guys don't study the cannabis books I think the smart guys study both
[01:32:49.580 --> 01:32:52.740]  to be honest with you you got to understand you don't necessarily need to
[01:32:52.740 --> 01:32:57.540]  read the cannabis books but uh you know I think you can't just read books on
[01:32:57.540 --> 01:33:01.060]  plants and understand cannabis cannabis is unlike any other plant variety that's
[01:33:01.060 --> 01:33:06.940]  cultivated at that level so there's a lot to it and just assuming it grows
[01:33:06.940 --> 01:33:11.020]  like oh Mike Tyson would be a great one anybody know Mike Tyson tell Mike Tyson
[01:33:11.020 --> 01:33:14.820]  I want him to come on my show I met Mike Tyson in 2006 and smoked a bunch of weed
[01:33:14.820 --> 01:33:23.020]  with him really really cool guy had a good time but you know who Ed muckle is
[01:33:23.020 --> 01:33:29.740]  that's Greg old-school what no I don't but Ed muckle sounds like a good person
[01:33:29.740 --> 01:33:37.780]  to have on the show do the new strain hunters yeah so we're looking at filming
[01:33:37.780 --> 01:33:49.650]  a pilot here in April so we'll see cannabis talk show type thing I don't
[01:33:49.650 --> 01:33:52.370]  really think we're the new strainers streamers is different than what we're
[01:33:52.370 --> 01:33:56.130]  doing strainers cool and their own I love those strain hunters videos I don't
[01:33:56.130 --> 01:33:59.210]  know if you guys have seen them or not seen them if you haven't seen them go
[01:33:59.210 --> 01:34:04.210]  check them out on man go go check them out on YouTube I believe they're
[01:34:04.210 --> 01:34:08.210]  available on YouTube and also on greenhouse seeds or greenhouse coffee
[01:34:08.210 --> 01:34:12.290]  shop calm but they go travel around the world collecting land-raised varieties
[01:34:12.290 --> 01:34:19.650]  and have a good time and you know RIP rest in peace Franco Franco was a guy I
[01:34:19.650 --> 01:34:24.290]  knew and hung out with in Europe and spent a good amount of time with smoking
[01:34:24.290 --> 01:34:30.130]  and talking about cannabis Arianne Simon who's in South Africa those guys
[01:34:30.130 --> 01:34:34.250]  would travel around the world and go to amazing places and look for land-raised
[01:34:34.250 --> 01:34:37.850]  varieties of cannabis that were cultivated and get the whole story I
[01:34:37.850 --> 01:34:42.290]  think that is absolutely amazing and that should inspire you to go out and
[01:34:42.290 --> 01:34:47.810]  try to find places like that safely hopefully you know Franco you know
[01:34:47.810 --> 01:34:52.730]  passion for the sacred pant if you know me the whole hashtag passion for the
[01:34:52.770 --> 01:34:57.930]  sacred plant was something that I said that Franco loved that got coined and
[01:34:57.930 --> 01:35:02.090]  you know he was part of that probably the most not even probably I would say
[01:35:02.090 --> 01:35:08.930]  Franco is and was the most passionate person in cannabis you know that I've
[01:35:08.930 --> 01:35:12.650]  ever known I mean the guy absolutely loved the plant I love the plant a lot
[01:35:12.650 --> 01:35:17.650]  of my friends love the plant Franco's love for the plant was contagious that's
[01:35:17.650 --> 01:35:24.690]  what made him so amazing and just he always was so happy about it loved
[01:35:24.690 --> 01:35:27.970]  looking at weed appreciated it on another level that most people would
[01:35:27.970 --> 01:35:33.730]  never experience you know he was meant for this industry and he left too soon
[01:35:33.730 --> 01:35:39.610]  so it's it's sad that he's gone but uh yeah real pioneer him and Ariane you
[01:35:39.610 --> 01:35:45.810]  know pioneered the whole cannabis show and the whole movement stuff that we're
[01:35:45.810 --> 01:35:49.250]  doing now we wouldn't be here if it wasn't for guys like Franco and and
[01:35:49.250 --> 01:35:53.850]  Ariane and even the group that came before him that older generation that
[01:35:53.850 --> 01:36:00.090]  the Mel Franks and the the Rob Clark's and the Ed Rosenthal's regardless of
[01:36:00.090 --> 01:36:03.930]  what you think of people these guys you know those those three especially and
[01:36:03.930 --> 01:36:09.610]  there's another handful of guys those guys paved the way for people like us we
[01:36:09.610 --> 01:36:15.250]  wouldn't be here today with a Jack Herrera Jack Herrera was a big one we're
[01:36:15.250 --> 01:36:18.530]  just talking about Jack Herrera how he loved talking about hemp and he loved
[01:36:18.530 --> 01:36:21.330]  he loved talking about cannabis but hemp being used as all these different things
[01:36:21.330 --> 01:36:29.250]  you know Dennis Perrone that's another one you know got to mention Dennis Eagle
[01:36:29.250 --> 01:36:35.890]  Bill there's there's so many great guys you know rest Neville Neville gone too
[01:36:35.890 --> 01:36:40.730]  soon these guys I guess someone mentioned Eddie he actually sent or his
[01:36:40.730 --> 01:36:48.570]  wife sent me a message this was about week and a half ago that he was he would
[01:36:48.570 --> 01:36:51.930]  feel better in a couple weeks but I'd love to bring Eddie on at some point
[01:36:51.930 --> 01:36:57.130]  awesome I'd love to have him on the show I think there's a lot of good stuff to
[01:36:57.130 --> 01:37:02.490]  talk about with Eddie and his experiences and you know it's too bad we
[01:37:02.490 --> 01:37:05.770]  can't have some of these guys on the show that have passed you know that
[01:37:05.770 --> 01:37:11.450]  their their movements the stuff they did for the industry that pushing the
[01:37:11.450 --> 01:37:14.210]  limits on stuff dank Duchess we could totally get her on the show I think
[01:37:14.210 --> 01:37:18.690]  she's got some interesting stuff to talk about with hash you know maybe we do a
[01:37:18.690 --> 01:37:22.970]  hash episode on breeding for hash varieties with nicotine Frenchie and
[01:37:22.970 --> 01:37:26.890]  dank Duchess I think that'd be fun one you guys like Ed Rosenthal he's one of
[01:37:26.890 --> 01:37:34.490]  my good friends we'll get Ed on here one of these days TGA sub cool rest in peace
[01:37:34.490 --> 01:37:39.450]  big sub and bog you know it's like bog you know another legend that was a real
[01:37:39.450 --> 01:37:48.840]  you know generation one of the the seed movement in the United States what do
[01:37:48.840 --> 01:37:53.520]  you guys think of swerve from Cali connections should we get swerve on here
[01:37:53.520 --> 01:38:00.640]  he's down here in LA I know I talked to swerve every once in a while Mountain
[01:38:00.640 --> 01:38:05.160]  Girl get Mountain Girl on here yeah I would love to do a dead themed show I
[01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:08.760]  mean Grateful Dead we could go into detail on some of the varieties that
[01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:12.200]  we're going around the Grateful Dead and a little bit of Grateful Dead history I
[01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:26.060]  had reached out to her a long time ago I could follow up with that yeah
[01:38:26.420 --> 01:38:31.500]  jungle boys already done their stuff on the show but I would love to get a them
[01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:34.820]  on here for some stuff about genetics I feel like they have a real interesting
[01:38:34.820 --> 01:38:38.820]  genetics I would say that you know the jungle boy stuff that I popped at a
[01:38:38.820 --> 01:38:43.580]  pheno hunt a couple years back almost like a year and a half ago we popped a
[01:38:43.580 --> 01:38:47.660]  whole bunch of stuff jungle boys was their varieties looked amazing they
[01:38:47.660 --> 01:38:53.180]  weren't the terpiest by any means but man la to the la to the finest as far as
[01:38:53.180 --> 01:38:56.740]  looks just like the LA women they look absolutely amazing but they have no soul
[01:38:56.740 --> 01:39:04.740]  I'm kidding a little bit but yeah we should taste good we've had him on the
[01:39:04.740 --> 01:39:16.300]  show so yeah a skunk man Sam Greg McAllister John Mayer we're not getting
[01:39:16.300 --> 01:39:21.180]  John Mayer on the show guys I'll put John Mayer on the show when Jerry comes
[01:39:21.180 --> 01:39:26.780]  back from the dead yeah literally did I have anything wrong with John Mayer
[01:39:26.780 --> 01:39:29.780]  there's nothing wrong there's I don't have any problem with him or anything I
[01:39:29.780 --> 01:39:34.900]  think he's a great musician I just I'm a Jerry I'm one of the Jerry kids that
[01:39:34.900 --> 01:39:40.700]  love Jerry and when Jerry passed it you know it'll never be the same also like
[01:39:40.700 --> 01:39:48.620]  and appreciate Bobby in the rest of man hmm you could do that get Phil on the
[01:39:48.620 --> 01:39:54.060]  show Willie Nelson I wonder if we can get Jim Belushi on the show I think
[01:39:54.060 --> 01:40:00.610]  that would be fun yeah an episode on transitioning from illegal to legal
[01:40:00.610 --> 01:40:04.610]  markets and lifestyle I mean I think everybody that comes on has a little bit
[01:40:04.610 --> 01:40:13.530]  of stories on that Ben drunkers from sensei would be a real interesting one
[01:40:13.530 --> 01:40:23.180]  now people are just throwing stuff out there Matthew McConaughey yeah so yeah I
[01:40:23.180 --> 01:40:27.100]  really appreciate you guys for staying on the show actually more than coming on
[01:40:27.100 --> 01:40:30.500]  the show if it's actually staying with us this this far
[01:40:30.500 --> 01:40:38.540]  oh gee we've gotten minimal I was expecting more people being like this

[01:40:56.980 --> 01:41:06.900]  government joints every month Wayne Justman hmm I'm not sure do I speak

[01:41:11.180 --> 01:41:16.020]  speak Finnish Mephisto yeah I think getting Mitch on here would be amazing

[01:41:19.740 --> 01:41:25.860]  the show I'm sure I'll reach out to him as well getting him on here copycat is I
[01:41:25.860 --> 01:41:28.700]  would love to have copycat on here because he has some interesting he
[01:41:28.700 --> 01:41:34.820]  knocks everybody's stuff off and I you know we'll get his side of the story I
[01:41:34.820 --> 01:41:38.460]  don't have a problem with what he does he doesn't knock my stuff off probably
[01:41:38.460 --> 01:41:44.020]  cuz it's not that good I guess but either either way I think copycat would
[01:41:44.020 --> 01:41:48.700]  be interesting he does s ones of a lot of stuff and you know there's there's
[01:41:48.700 --> 01:41:51.420]  little niches it's like everybody has their little niche the guys that are
[01:41:51.420 --> 01:41:55.340]  real successful everybody has their niche we all do stuff a little bit
[01:41:55.340 --> 01:42:00.100]  differently my main focus was bulk and wholesale seeds and now I'm going back
[01:42:00.100 --> 01:42:03.740]  to retail I think there's a lot of potential for that I was really
[01:42:03.740 --> 01:42:10.700]  surprised what we did on Black Friday I think you were too Peter there's a lot
[01:42:10.700 --> 01:42:18.380]  of seeds to pack up yeah who knew my little fingers can only go so fast yeah
[01:42:18.380 --> 01:42:21.860]  we want to do with one with Mojave Mojave and I did a show with Peter and
[01:42:21.860 --> 01:42:25.660]  we'll see if we can get him back on here but yeah Mojave Richmond created the
[01:42:25.660 --> 01:42:30.620]  stage he's a good friend really knowledgeable guy Rob Clark's business

[01:42:45.020 --> 01:42:50.820]  gear we will be doing giveaways yeah actually we're kind of nearing time
[01:42:50.820 --> 01:42:56.140]  where if people want to send us pictures of some of the stuff they're growing out
[01:42:56.140 --> 01:43:03.100]  from ganja farmer or the loud canna genetics we can can start to show stuff
[01:43:03.100 --> 01:43:07.300]  on screen not only can we show it on screen but we will have a contest for
[01:43:07.300 --> 01:43:11.740]  the people that have the best pictures of my gear I will be sending you free
[01:43:11.740 --> 01:43:16.540]  packs if you we're gonna have a contest you know every week maybe not starting
[01:43:16.540 --> 01:43:20.740]  next week but the week after Super Bowl will start it if people want to send in
[01:43:20.740 --> 01:43:26.100]  pictures of the gear and we will start giving away seeds to the people that
[01:43:26.100 --> 01:43:33.620]  have the best varieties of our stuff I don't need a seed sorting machine now he
[01:43:33.620 --> 01:43:40.580]  is the seed sorting machine right I need something that plops 5 10 12 seeds into
[01:43:40.580 --> 01:43:49.180]  a vial yeah that's a seven-year-old kid it's perfect yeah no Gemma was yeah no I
[01:43:49.180 --> 01:43:56.980]  had Gemma was really into doing it for like yeah there was one day where she
[01:43:56.980 --> 01:44:02.260]  was into it and I got it she did like 30 she packed up 30 vials or something like
[01:44:02.260 --> 01:44:09.100]  that yeah so someone enthusiasm continues yeah the end of the easily
[01:44:09.100 --> 01:44:14.060]  300 a day to get paid yeah someone said they couldn't find loud seeds available
[01:44:14.060 --> 01:44:18.060]  because loud seeds are not available be careful if you're buying loud seeds if
[01:44:18.060 --> 01:44:24.500]  you buy James loud genetics which would be the ganja farmer seed company or loud
[01:44:24.500 --> 01:44:28.900]  canna genics or like collaboration project without I'm done it's available
[01:44:28.900 --> 01:44:33.460]  at seeds here now my seeds aren't readily available everywhere I do that
[01:44:33.460 --> 01:44:37.700]  on purpose I don't have them with every seed bank that's selling seeds I'm
[01:44:37.700 --> 01:44:43.060]  selective it's it's easier to see if there's fakes out there I feel like your
[01:44:43.060 --> 01:44:46.460]  stuff doesn't get knocked off as much having it available at daggad I love I
[01:44:46.460 --> 01:44:53.260]  trust Peter 100% I trust he does he does some packaging with stuff you know
[01:44:53.260 --> 01:44:57.740]  because I'm a bulk seed sales guy at least I thought of myself as one loud
[01:44:57.740 --> 01:45:01.620]  seeds we did retail but now I'm moving back into retail with help from guys
[01:45:01.620 --> 01:45:05.940]  like Peter you know so it's a it's an interesting transition but I'm not
[01:45:05.940 --> 01:45:09.460]  trying to get my stuff knocked off and I don't need it to be available
[01:45:09.460 --> 01:45:13.420]  everywhere and you know I can appreciate the people to buy it seeds here now and
[01:45:13.420 --> 01:45:18.540]  daggad love you know and then I got some European stuff I have friends over in

[01:45:29.500 --> 01:45:32.780]  ton of cool stuff coming down the pipeline let's just hope kovat goes away
[01:45:32.780 --> 01:45:41.740]  sooner than later what should we really yeah I think so I'm ready to go take a
