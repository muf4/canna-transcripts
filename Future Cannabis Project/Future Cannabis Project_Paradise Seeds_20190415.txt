[00:00.000 --> 00:05.000]  Future Cannabis Project, welcome! Thank you very much for watching. This is Arjen
[00:05.000 --> 00:09.840]  from Paradise Seeds. We're coming live to you from the Spannabis Expo in
[00:09.840 --> 00:16.120]  Barcelona 2019. For those of you who are not aware of who Paradise Seeds are, well
[00:16.120 --> 00:20.800]  actually we've been here for a little while. We've been here for 25 years. We're
[00:20.800 --> 00:24.900]  actually celebrating our 25th anniversary this year here at Spannabis
[00:24.900 --> 00:30.180]  and it's a great celebration indeed because we have entered a few of our
[00:30.180 --> 00:36.980]  varieties in Spannabis Champions Cup and we've actually taken second prize with
[00:36.980 --> 00:42.780]  our LA Amnesia last night during the award ceremony. So that was really, really
[00:42.780 --> 00:47.540]  exciting. One of the three varieties that we brought out together with Tommy Chong
[00:47.540 --> 00:52.340]  and Chong's Choice with the finest seed collection of Paradise Seeds. That brings
[00:52.420 --> 00:59.540]  us now to about 37 different strains in our catalog here. There's seven different
[00:59.540 --> 01:03.940]  outer flowers. We've got a few CBD rich strains in there. So there's a whole big
[01:03.940 --> 01:08.940]  variety of different things that are nice for different types of growers
[01:08.940 --> 01:14.180]  indoor and outdoor. There goes a little package that I wanted to show you. So
[01:14.180 --> 01:19.300]  here's our catalog. Now you grab the catalog here. Show me this package. Let me
[01:19.300 --> 01:25.580]  show you just because we found out yesterday that there's fake packaging
[01:25.580 --> 01:31.700]  going around as well for Paradise Seeds. Now this is of course the evident thing
[01:31.700 --> 01:37.180]  that happens whenever you're successful. People start copying your stuff right. So
[01:37.180 --> 01:42.060]  in Russia actually these Russian gangsters they've copied our seeds and
[01:42.060 --> 01:47.140]  the package doesn't even look anything like this. So it's very easy to spot. The
[01:47.140 --> 01:50.380]  only thing that's on that package is actually the logo. That's the correct
[01:50.380 --> 01:55.180]  thing but for the rest the package is gray and it's square. So it really looks
[01:55.180 --> 02:00.020]  very strange but this is the original packaging by Paradise Seeds. This is the
[02:00.020 --> 02:03.900]  way it should should look like. So you zoom into that. I'll show you the
[02:03.900 --> 02:08.180]  background of it as well. The back of it should look like this. There's a little
[02:08.180 --> 02:13.300]  barcode as well you see. Now we got three, five and ten packs in our collection.
[02:13.300 --> 02:19.260]  We'll very soon add one and fifty packs to that as well. So you'll have a lot
[02:19.260 --> 02:24.660]  more choice in the number of seeds that you'll find in the packs.
[02:24.660 --> 02:31.780]  So very exciting year for us now. The CBD strains today are very very popular.
[02:31.780 --> 02:38.460]  Today in our portfolio we have two strains that are CBD rich but they're
[02:38.460 --> 02:45.600]  also still THC rich. That means they have a one-to-one ratio THC CBD which is
[02:45.600 --> 02:50.260]  very interesting from a medicinal perspective of course. And we are
[02:50.260 --> 02:54.940]  currently in the test phase just before releasing them. So hopefully we will be
[02:54.940 --> 03:01.980]  releasing very soon CBD strains that are high in CBD but low in THC. So there'll
[03:01.980 --> 03:10.260]  be between 0.2 up to 0.6 percent of THC in there but there'll be a high quantity
[03:10.260 --> 03:15.700]  of CBD in there. So we're very close to releasing them so stay tuned for that
[03:15.700 --> 03:18.100]  for sure.
[03:21.540 --> 03:26.580]  That's a very difficult question my man. It's like asking a child you know a
[03:26.580 --> 03:31.300]  mother what's their favorite child you know. It's a little bit depending on the
[03:31.300 --> 03:36.100]  weed you know also. You got good sativa, you got bad indica. I love to smoke weed
[03:36.100 --> 03:41.900]  anyway. It's for me a sativa in the morning and an indica during the day. But
[03:41.900 --> 03:45.180]  I'll do it the other way around as well if it just comes like that you know. I
[03:45.180 --> 03:50.740]  just smoke like to smoke and enjoy good quality weed that is clean weed that is
[03:50.740 --> 03:57.060]  preferably organically grown you know. That is a white ash that is a pure nice
[03:57.060 --> 04:02.340]  flavor and for me that is more important than the indica sativa I think.
[04:02.340 --> 04:09.140]  And I'm also very fond of hybrids actually. What are you gonna tell us about the background?
[04:09.140 --> 04:16.980]  Yeah man that's amazing. Look at this guys. This is 150 kilograms of white
[04:16.980 --> 04:22.340]  widow paradise seeds white widow being grown in a secret location obviously in
[04:22.420 --> 04:28.020]  the north of Africa in this case. And this is actually a few years ago already
[04:28.020 --> 04:34.100]  but we were really really excited to see this. And well it's now the background of
[04:34.100 --> 04:38.380]  our photo booth. So you can stand there with our photo booth and then take a
[04:38.380 --> 04:41.700]  picture, a souvenir picture.
[04:41.700 --> 04:43.700]  So you say all are the bad packages but which is the good one?
[04:44.660 --> 04:51.620]  Yes so let me show you these packages. This is the good package.
[04:51.620 --> 04:58.900]  Now there's one other version of it. It looks like this.
[04:58.900 --> 05:06.060]  This is the Chong's Choice. So we bought three varieties to market last year with
[05:06.060 --> 05:10.380]  Tommy Chong and Chong's Choice and a pure indica 90% indica with the blue
[05:10.380 --> 05:16.740]  kush berry. And then we did a hybrid with the Mendocino skunk and we did a very
[05:16.820 --> 05:22.340]  strong sativa with the LA amnesia and that is the one that actually won the
[05:22.340 --> 05:28.060]  cup last night at the Spanavis Champions Cup. So come get your Chong's Choice
[05:28.060 --> 05:32.460]  seeds at Paradise Seeds. These look a little bit different so the package here
[05:32.460 --> 05:37.660]  with obviously with Tommy Chong on there. And I got a little extra surprise for
[05:37.660 --> 05:42.140]  everybody buying our seeds right now. You get a free extra seed
[05:42.140 --> 05:46.500]  celebration seed from us. This is the first seed that we actually ever brought
[05:46.580 --> 05:52.700]  to market 25 years ago. This is because of our celebration our anniversary we
[05:52.700 --> 05:56.740]  want to give everybody who buys a pack of our seeds one of these for free. So
[05:56.740 --> 06:00.620]  this is actually one of the most expensive strains in our catalog that
[06:00.620 --> 06:05.060]  we're giving away now. So that's really exciting and these are a little bit
[06:05.060 --> 06:09.340]  smaller packages right. So you see the regular packages are like this and the
[06:09.340 --> 06:14.860]  promo pack is a smaller one. So with every big one you get one small one.
[06:14.900 --> 06:18.900]  So that's a real good deal I think for you guys. And actually why don't we do
[06:18.900 --> 06:22.980]  something extra. Why don't I give you some of these and then you can give away
[06:22.980 --> 06:28.300]  to your viewers. Right you can do a little raffle on the people who like the
[06:28.300 --> 06:32.220]  video. You just pick three winners and you can get some Paradise Seeds if you
[06:32.220 --> 06:36.540]  if you're at all up for that. I mean if you like it.
[06:36.540 --> 06:40.860]  Yeah just pack them in your luggage.
